Price Center expansion 
concepts revealed 

, Â·Architects give four scenarios, 
committee selects preferred plans 

By BRYAN lSAO 
Associate News Editor 

After being presented with four 
potential schemes for the Price 
Center expansion, the Building 
Advisory Committee chose one pri-
mary and one secondary proposal on 
March 4. The primary proposal, 
dubbed the "Pinwheel" design, 
involves expanding the east side of 
Price Center with a structure cen-
tered around an additional ballroom, 
a 24-hour student lounge, new 
locales for the Cross-Cultural 
Center and Alumni Association, and 

various other food and retail outlets 
situated around it. Of the 22 com-
mittee members, l3 favored the pin-
wheel design in a straw poU, while 
eight members supported the alter-
nate "Towers" proposal. 

"The focus of [the pinwheel 
scheme] is a central, [open space], 
which becomes the part of the 
building that becomes the focus of 
what's happening in Price Center," 
said Mehrdad Yazdani, the archi-
tect hired from the firm Cannon 
Design. "This space is multilevel

WinterFest draws 6,000 
Switchfoot dedicates song to Chern 6A 
By MARGRET GONZALES 

Staff Writer 
An estimated 6,000 students ., 

attended this year's WmterFest 
which featured musical guests 
Louis XIV, Talib Kweli and 
Switchfoot, at RJMAC Arena 
on March 5. 

"It was a big success, espe-
cially with the crowd that came," 
WinterFest Co-Coordinator 
Sean Mandel-Torin said. "It 
went very smoothly; there were 
no injuries. It was a mellow show 
and all the band were cool." 

The concert featured a vari-
ety of music genres including 
alternative rock and rap. ' 

"Our original thinking when 
planning a show is to make as 
many people happy on campus 
and basically just to get what 
the students want most," 
WinterFest Co-Coordinator 
Rishi Shah said. 

According to Shah, A.S. 
Programming attempted to con-
tact over 100 bands to find out 
who was available on March 5, 
for what price and who wanted 
to perform at the UCSD. 

"Basically, we contacted every 
band on the same level as these 
artists," Shah said. "It's so hard to 
book these bands who will bring 
a large turnout to show." 

Local band Louis XIV was 
added to the musical guest list a 
few weeks after A.S. 
Programming announced 
Switchfoot and Talib Kweli. 

"We always had Louis XIV 
in mind, but they were added so 
late because we had lots of

With events like kissing pigs 
and karaoke, the third annual 
UCSD Cares attracted over 60 
campus community service orga-
nizations to Library Walk on 
March 1 through March 5. 
Sponsored by Associated 
Students, Student Organizations 
and Leadership Opportunities 
and UCSD Bookstore, events 
benefited causes ranging from 
Locks of Love to diabetes 
research. 

According to organizers, the 
number of participating organi-
zations has grown each year of 
the event, from 40 last year to 60 
this year. 

"Each year we seem to 
increase the number of organiza-

tions who want to come out and 
participate, and we get a lot more 
creative ideas from these organi-
zations," UCSD Cares commit-
tee member and Earl Warren 
College senior Sumeet Ahand 
said.

the Gulf of California is making an to ecosys-
tem-wide change in the marine environment 
of the region. An article published by 
researchers for Fisheries magazine c~lIs for rig-
orous management of new fisheries in the 
region. 

Using data from field surveys, statistics and 
interviews of fishermen, the researchers found 
that coastal food webs in the Gulf of California 
have been considerably impacted since the 
1970s. In the article, the authors describe how 
the region has been "fished down" in the past 
30 years. Even though there is a low human 
population densi ty in the Gulf of California, the 
area is still subjected to intense fishing activities. 
Targeted species for fishing include sharks, bony 
fishes and rays. 

The fish stock depletion has also forced fish-
ers to move their fishing sites away from fishing 
villages. Results also show that species not tar-
geted during the 1970s such as parrotfish, 
whitefish, spotted snapper and tilefish, are now 
the most common catches. According to the 
authors of the article, the study shows a trend 
that the fisheries in the area have fished down 
the food web, which is leading to effects on the 
entire coastal ecosystem. 

The 510 researchers also suggest that man-
agement of fisheries and fish spawning activities 
is important to prevent further decline in the 
area. 

S~posium to discuss role 
of Ijrain in processing art 
A symposium exploring brain activity in pro-

cessing images and art WIll be held on March 
20 at Price Center Theatre. The event includes 
a discussion of how human-built environments 
affect the way people think and feel. The event 
is sponsored by the UCSD Center for 
Humanities, the UCSD Stuart Art Collection, the 
Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego and 
the Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture. 

The symposium will feature three sessions. 
One event will explore how spatial information 
is processed by the nerve cells. .â¢ 

Another session will feature architects who 
will speak about the interplay between inner and 
outer space and how a design for a habitat needs 
to reflect human needs and feelings. 

The third session will feature visual, music 
and theatre artists speaking on the different 
approaches of dealing with space in their own 
specific creative activities. 

The symposium will be held from 9 a.m. to 
1 p.m. and is free and open to the public.

Proposed bill would aim for 
diverse ideologies among faculty 

By USA MAl( 
Staff Writer 

Legislators in the House of 
Representatives are currently consid-
ering an "Academic Bill of Rights" 
that would encourage universities to 
develop an environment of intellec-
nl3l diversity by adopting ideologi-
cally-neutral hiring practices and 
academic policies. 

The bill was introduced in 
Congress by Rep. Jack Kingston (R-
G a.) and is supported by conserva-
tive lobbyist David Horowitz and 
his California-based Center for 
Study of Popular Culture. 

According to Horowitz, the bill 
was a response to trends of the last 
30 years, in which liberal professors 
have increasingly outnumbered 
conservative ones in a more politi-
cized university setting. 

"In the [university] typical facul-
ty, Democrats outnumber 
Republicans by 10 to one," he said . 
"This shows that not only is there 
an absence of Re publicans, but 
there's a rule to keep them out ." 

T he bill protects university facul-
ty members from bei ng hired, fired 
or denied promotion or tenure on 
the basis of thei r pol itical, ideolog-
ical or religious beliefs. It also aims 
to protect students from being 
graded o n ideological grounds. 

Furthermore, the bill prohibi ts 
faculty from "indoctrinati ng" stu-
dents in the classroom and empha-
sizes exposing sruden ts to a plurali-
ty of viewpoints on course rnateri al. 

"The proposal fo r an Academic 
Bill of Rights is being made beCause 
universities are allowing, and even 
encouraging, faculty to seduce the 
innocent, taking improper advan-
tage of unfonned minds, rather than 
encouraging students to understlnd 

different viewpoints and come to 
their own judgments," Sanford 
Lakoff, professor emerirus of politi-
cal science at UCSD said. 

Proponents of the bill claim that 
often only one political or ideologi-
cal perspective is taught in classes 
while dissenting perspectives are 
ignored. 

Among the bill's opponents is 
the American Association of 
University Professors. Although 
the AAUP agrees with the general 
principles of academic neutrality 
and opposes indoctrination, it 
states that such issues should be 
handled by educational institu-
tions, not by outside bodies of gov-
ernment. 

"There's a fundamental prob-
lem with the government imposing 
a balance on the university," Mark 
F. Smith, director of government 
relations for AAUP, said. "In terms 
of academic decisions, the govern-
me nt should not impose any ideo-
logical or intellectual standards on 
the universi ty." 

According to Smith, srudents 
sh ould use university grievance 
procedurt!s if they feel that they are 
being graded unfai rly due to politi -
ca l o r ideological differences. 

T he AAUP argues that profes-
sors are trai ned in their respective 
disciplines and have their own pro-
fessional and methodological stan-
da rds, so academic decisions should 
be left up to facul ty members. 

" In my teaching and my writ-
ings, I have tried to be as objective 
as possible and to present different 
viewpoints in their best possible 
form," Lakoff said. "My ideology 
does have something to do with the 
topics I choose to teach or write 
abo ut ... but in none of these 
efforts have I sought to present 

only interpretations I agree with." 
Opponents of the bill fear that in 

attempting to achieve a balance of 
perspective at universities, ideologies 
will be used to evaluate faculty mem-
bers, as opposed to standards of the 
academic profession. 

Proponents, however, respond 
that the bill will not create political 
quotas for faculty and is committed 
to the independence of the univer-
si ties w hi Ie sti \I allowing professors 
and students to express and be 
exposed to a variety of opinions. 

"There's nothing in the bill that 
says we want more conservatism," 
Stephen Anderson, Kingston's leg-
islative assistant said. 

Some UCSD students oppose 
the bill . 

"Far from hindering our educa-
tion, our professors ask students to 
be inquisitive and critical [and] take 
nothing at face value,~ John Muir 
College sophomore Phong Wu 
said. "[The bill) would push for 
greater university politics." 

Others, however, argue that the 
bill is necessary to ensure academ-
ic diversity. 

"The [bill) is a necessary law 
because Â·it ensures students who have 
a different perspective will not be 
discriminated against aademically," 
Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more Justin Ryan said. "lOat pro-
tection currently doesn't exist, espe-
cially at more liberal schools such as 
the UC system, since the academic 
freedom code exists, but isn't 
adhered to. If you ignore the liberal 
professors and the angry conserva-
tives, the bill makes a lot of sense." 

The bill is currently being con-
sidered in the Subcommittee of 21st 
Century Competitiveness under the 
House Committee on Education 
and the Worlcforce.

Governor has kept promises 
and averted fiscal crisis 
By DUSTIN FRELICH 

Senior Staff Writer 

Amilestone came and went on Feb. 24, marking 100 days since former California Gov. Gray Davis was offi-
cially terminated and replaced by none other 
than the Terminator himself, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. Right off the 
bat, Schwarzenegger vowed to 

respect of many on both sides of the aisle. 
He's also worked quickly: 
Schwarzenegger's twO bills - Proposition 
57 and Proposition 58 - passed with over-
whelming support in the March Z vote. 

The Proposition 57 bond initiative will 
allow California to refinance budget 
deficits with lower rates while Proposition 

58 restrains the legislature by 
requiring a yearly balanced 
budget. bring something new to 

California politics - action. And 
just like in his movies, action is 
what he has delivered thus far. 

Within minutes of being 
sworn in - yes, literally -
Schwarzenegger marched right 

PRO "Never again will govern-ment be allowed to spend money it doesn't have," Schwarzenegger said while touting his bill in his 
into the Capitol building in 
Sacramento and signed Executive Order. 
No. I, repealing Davis' wildly unpopular car 
tax increase. The increase would have 
unfairly raised California's automobile tax 
three-fold , and Schwarzenegger rightly 
O\'erturned it. 

He also challenged other aspects of 
lunacy left over from the Davis era. Weeks 
later, Schwarzenegger managed to con-
vince the California legislature to repeal a 
law passed just a few months earlier that 
would have given state driver's licenses to 
illegal immigrants. 

The Senate voted in favor of the repeal, 
33-0, as did the Assembly, by a vote of 64-9. 

Schwarzenegger still wasn't done clean-
ing up Davis' mess, however. 

His biggest challenge is to restore the 
California economy. For a state economy 
that rivals that of many nations, California's 
economic troubles are no laughing matter. 
But unlike the tax-and-spend policy favored 
by some, Schwarzenegger went to 
Sacramento with a real solution in mind. 

His solution: Restrain out-of-control 
spending in order to avoid raising taxes. At 
first, Schwarzenegger had a rough time con-
vincing DemocratS in Sacramento to tighten 
the purse strings. After all, it's hard to stop a 
politician from spending someone else's 
hard-earned cash to buy future support. 

But after blocking attempts by some 
Republican legislators in early December 
to make actual cuts, California Democrats 
finally acquiesced to a compromise, one 
which called for real spending restrictions. 

Schwarzenegger's deal-brokering had 
worked, and he was happy. 

"Today, I'm a happy governor," he said 
after signing the spending bill that passed 
35-5 in the Senate. "I'm very happy 
because both parties came together." 

To some, however, like California 
Treasurer Phil Angelides, Schwarzeneggers 
success in bringing both parties together to 
restrict spending was no feat. 

"This governor, in his first 100 days, 
has taken the cheap way out," Angelides 
said on Schwarzenegger's 100-day anniver-
sa ry. "I think there's a missed opportunity. 
This was a chance to really ask 
Californians to sacrifice." 

Aside from the blatant partisan rhetoric 
seen here - one would be hard-pressed to 
argue with a straight face that Californians 
secretly lOam taxes increased - Californians 
simply don't agree with Angelides' claim that 
Schwarzenegger has failed voters. Indeed, in 
<I recent field poll, 
Schwarzenegger's disap-

" 

State of the State address earlier 
this year. 

Although borrowing to payoff debts is 
hardly the best option available, 
Schwarzenegger's hands were tied by 
California Democrats who refused to go 
along with real cuts. But all is not lost.

Schwarzenegger has resorted-
to gimmicks and hypocrisy 

By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The numbers were in: the proposed 515 billion bond initiative appear-ing on the March 2 ballot was going 
to fail, a Feb. ZL poll said. Only 38 percent 
of Californians supported delaying recon-
ciling today's debt by slapping 
it on a new credit card autho-

the specifics of policies that would restore 
California's financial footing. While mak-
ing good on campaign promises to repeal 
both the car-tax hike and a law allowing 
driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, 
Schwarzenegger has neglected the bro~der 
issues he addressed with action-packed 
rhetoric during his campaigning - name-

ly budget management, work-
er's compensation, public 

rized by Proposition 57, only to 
pay it and then some back in 
the future. 

But Gov. Arnold Schwarz-
enegger, who was relying on 
his sweeping popularity and its 
link to Proposition 57 to carry 

(ON infrastructure and special-interest lobbying. Schwarzenegger's budget strategies have been to cut, borrow and do everything pos-
sible to avoid permanently fix-

the initiative to an uncontested victory, did 
what anyone would expect of the anti-spe-
cial interest recall candidate: He rolled up 
his sleeves and jetted to New York that 
week for a 5500,OOO-per-plate donor din-
ner to fund-raise for a California proposi-
tion telling of his credibil-
ity to take "action, action, 
action." 

" 

ing the state's financial mess. 
The governor's January draft 

of the 2004-05 budget - which includes 
tuition hikes in the state's colleges, slashed 
funding for programs, and deviation from 
State-University of California 
Partnership-protected enrollment - still 
has a $7 billion to $8 billion hole in it. III 
his first 100 days, Schwarzenegger has 
repealed the ca r-tax increase while failing 
to find a revenue source to replace its $4-
billion annual take; placed a freeze on state 
hiring at a time when the national work 
force is continually shrinking; and promot-
ed Proposition 57 to borrow billions to 
substitute long-te rm debt for immediate 
budget shortfalls. All this comes after cas-
tigating Davis for, in principle, doing the 
same thing. 

The difference is that Davis' actions to 
issue the bonds without voter approval 
were deemed illegal. But the delay to wait 
until after the March election to start issu-
ing bonds cost the state millions because of 
the higher interest the state needs to shell 
out to investors taking bonds on such a 
poor credit rating. 

Further, UCSD ~conomics professor 
Ross Starr implied that Proposition 57 did 
nothing more than buy Schwarzenegger 
time. State Treasurer Phil Angelides 
argued to raise income taxes to replace the 
money Davis' proposed bond and the car-
tax hike generated for the state. 

Starr believes that, as it stands, 
Schwarzenegger will probably restore 
income tax rates for the upper-income 
brackets to what they were under former 
Republican governors Ronald Reagan and 
Pete Wilson - 9 percent for single 
incomes of $140,000 and couples making 
5280,000, and II percent for individual 
incomes of 5Z80,000 and couples earning 
5560,000 - in his next revision of the 
2004-05 fiscal year budget. Angelides and 
Starr argue that imposing the upper-
income tax: increase when he got into office 
would have boosted the state's credit rating 
(decreasing current interest payments) 
while lessening the amount 'borrowed and 
the interest rates of a bond to be passed 
after the increase. 

Instead, voters just passed the largest, 
most expensive municipal bond in America 
to buy time before Schwarzenegger has 
realized that higher taxes on those income 
brackets need to be restored. The II per-
cent bracket would include I percent of 
Californians, a group Angclides said will 
receive nearly $12 .8 billion from federal 

tax cuts this year. 

Ten days and 510 mil-
lion later, 
Schwarzenegger's barrage 
of ads and appearances 
changed Californians' 
opinion, as they autho-
ri zed the credit card with 

Proposition 57 did 
nothing mare than buy 
Schwarzenegger time." 

Another 
Schwarzenegger cam-
paign slogan was that 
"We need a lot of infra-
structure in California" 
when heralding 
Proposition 53, also on 
the recall election's bal -

63 percent of the vote. Much like the 
quick-fix Proposition 57 presents to the 
state's fiscal woes, Schwarzenegger himself 
is an artificial solution - relying on 
mantras to gain public appeal while not 
doing any of the heavy lifting needed to 
relieve California of the weighty problems 
he promised to fix. 

Schwarzenegger, now 100-plus days in 
office, used an outsider's rhetoric during 
his recall candidacy, while straying from 

lot. However, his 
January budget revision tells another story 
- 53.4 billion will be cut from transporta-
tion construction over the next six years. 
The Southern California Association of 
Governments estimates the state's econo-
my will lose out on nearly 5Z billion annu-
ally, due to lost construction contracts, 
traffic congestion, and adverse health 
effects stemming from infrastructure

What might UCSD be like in 20 years?

I awoke, slapping at the infernal alarm clock next to my bed several times. Blinking the sleep out of my eyes, I 
could hear the pit-pan of rain outside on my 
fifth floor window in the Revelle College 
aparnnents as I got up and stretched. Crap. I 
have to meet Sara at the Trolley stop this 
morning. I thought they said it wasn't going 
to rain. 

I swiped at my mouse, and the interference 
OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) dis-
play on my desk next to my bed sprang to life, 
casting a ghostly shadow across my room. 
Sitting down at my chair, I came in range of 
the pseudo-depth effect of the screcn and 
brought up Mozilla. Click, click -
MyUCSD. I was right - 10 percent precipi -
tation. It was conting down like Noah out 
there. Well, while I was on the site, I thought 
I might as well get some work done; Sara 
wouldn't be coming for another hoUT or so, 
and I'd been meaning to apply to graduate 
anyway. 

"Make mre you have cleared with your 
deparnnents that you are ready for gradua-
tion. This application \vill be automatically 
rejected if your departmental clea rances are 
not in oUT system." I ignored the message; 
half the departments still missed tile deadline 
in Winter quarter anyway, the net result being 
they had left the system open ro any applica-
tion . Digital paperwork, my ass. I'm probably 
going to have to stop by Physics today to 
make sure it gets done. 

Nonetheless, 1 filled out the necessary 
fields. Major: Physics. Graduation quarter: 
SPO'4, College: John Muir - by virtue of 
seniority and way too few aparonents in Muir 
to handle the number of their seniors, I was 
stuck in the Muir seniors enclave of the rela-
tively new Revelle apartmentS. They had bull-
dozed the Fleets a decade ago, but only 

recently gotten around to building the new 
Revelle housing after the state budget freeze 
seven years ago). Submit. Wait. I'm forgetting 
something. 

Oh, that's right, basketball tickets. UCLA 
was playing us next week, and I promised 
Sara that we'd go despite the fact that 1 loathe 
attending sports events. It's completely 
ridiculous: five years ago, coming out of the 
budget crisis, the administration decided that 
the only way to avoid perennial budget insan-
ity at either the state or federal level was to 
boost alumni donations and to move the 
school to Division I. So, they railroaded a 
student fee vote, demolished the perfectly 
usable RlMAC Arena, and built the bigger 
and better Watson Arena that opened this 
year. New, shiny and perfectly built for tele-
vision broadcasts, so the entire country (or 
anyone who roned into ESPN 5 that day) 
could watch UCSD get creamed by UCLA 
- for the fifth year in a row. And for this they 
think they're going to get money? Well, I 
haven't been paying enough attention to Sara 
lately anyway - senior year physics will do 
that to you. 

Still, I can't help but think the entire 
endeavor is a bit like watching the Christians 
and the Lions. The ones being eaten, inci-
dentally, were the UCSD athletes. At least 
UCSD still did not give out athletic scholar-
ships, although as oflate I've felt I'm the only 
sane one who still thinks it'd be 3 bad idea. In 
the last 30 years, we'd gone from being UC 
Irvine to being a public Cal Tech or MIT -
and they want to rurn us back into UCLA or 
Boulder, complete with athletic scholarships, 
post-football game riotS and an orgy of wor-
ship at a circle of pagan gods whose anointed 
task has nothing to do with the real mission 
of this university, namely the pursuit of high-

. er knowledge and its conveyance to a greater 
number of individuals. 

Grudgingly, I bought the ticketS online 
while eating a bowl of cereal. I rweaked some 
of my RSS feeds and got rid of the Triton bas-
ketball news that Sara has inserted into the 
rest of the news feeds that projected from the

Grabbing my FlexPad and heading out 

the door, I started the long trot from 
Revelle to the Trolley stop, which by way 
of irate ci ty residents was on the far side of 
Camp Snoopy (which now housed Tenth, 
the final college). The FlexPad itself was a 
cheap 80Z.11 wireless OLED computer, 
which as one might assume from its name, 
was flexible, waterproof, dirtproof and 
probably flushable if I ever felt like going 
to the sewer to get it back in perfect work-
ing order. Reading the latest issue of the 
Economist on it was, in any case, a wel-
come distraction from the gutted lot where 
the old Student Center and the crafts cen-
ter used to be, and where the Bonner Hall 
extension would soon be constructed. The 
biologists already owned half the campus, 
and it depressed me to walk by the bulldoz-
ers every morning where there were once 
horrendous-looking orange wooden build-
ings that actually had some feeling of char-
acter to them. 

Absorbed in the Economist's cogent analy-
sis of the demise of the Republican Party into 
the Libertarians and the Fundamentalists at 
last week's convention in Boise, Idaho, I made 
my way by the construction and all the way to 
the Trolley stop without so much as a pang of 
melancholy. 

Sara was waiting for me, a bit damp and a 
bi t perturbed, as she had only her jacket and 
no umbrella. 

"1 got tickets for the UCLA game," I 
grumbled at her, a bit damp myself, but at 
least with an umbrella, which I promptly 
shuffled her under. She visibly brightened at 
this news, which was oddly both irritating and 
gratifying in some way. She squeezed my 
hand. 

"Ready for Quanrom with IntriUigator?" 
"Sure."

OPINION 5 

Con: Only more 
quick fixes lurk 

behind the 
govemor's rhetoric 

cominued from page 4 
problems. 

The governor's initi a l platform also 
inel uded action toward a reformed work-
er's compensation policy. In his State of 
the State speech, he set a March I dead-
line, which has since passed, for legislation 
to be completed. While most people 
viewed it as an artificial deadline designed 
to spur legis lative action anyway, his office 
has largely been absent from the negotia-
tions going on - creating the usual dia-
logue between the legislature and hi s 
favorite whipping boy, the special inter-
ests. 

Despite Schwarzenegger's promises to 
bring a worker's comp proposal to the vot-
ers if the legislature and governor 's office 
can't hash it out, there's no denying that 
the proposi tion, like every other direct bal-
lot initiative, will go largely funded by the 
special interest groups, whose influence on 
Sacramento pol icyrnaking Schwarzenegger 
was elected to destroy, or at least weaken . 

The Workers for Compen sa tion 
Reform told the Sail Diego Uniol1- T1'Ib/l1/( 
that between $15 million and $20 million 
would be spent by each side of the initia-
tive if it were to go ro the voters in 

ovember. How can the "people's gover-
nor" - who has organized events to raise 
more than $20 million himself since his 
election - keep allowing this to happenl 
The answer is that while Schwarzencgger 
ran a flashy campaign about real change in 
the state, he has across the board been 
unable to stray from the Sacr3menro poli-
tics-as-usual mentality. Meanwhile, his 
populist message is becoming more and 
more clouded by the swi rling doubts that 
any significant difference is going to be 
made - at least until the next time the 
state panics and orders a recall. 



6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MARCH 8, 2004 

Kerry and Bush to fight for a divided country 
Democratic nominee should pick a complimentary running mate 

By ZACH ROSEN 
Staff Writer 

T he pri mary season is officially 
over. Well , not officially, but with 
just over half of the states report-
ing, the Democratic nominee for 
president is clea r. Sen . John Kerry 
(D -M ass.) has accompli shed a 
miraculous comeback , not only 
overtaking form er frontrunner 
H oward Dea n, but totally crushing 
him in almost every state-. 

Kerry seal ed the nomination 
with las t Tuesday's big primaries, 
which knocked out hi s last major 
competiti on, Sen. J ohn Edwards 
(D -N.C.). It's no surprise really. 
Virtuall y everyone in politics has 
known that the Edwards nomina-
tio n was a fi ction from the 
moment Kerry pulled ahead. Yes, 

, Edwards fini shed second place in 
many states, and actually won one 
for himself. But even Dean man-
aged to win a state, and one must 
remember that second place is first 
loser. The only thing keeping the 
Edwa rds campaign afloat this faf 
was medi a buzz. With Edwards 
sti ll in and presenting the illusion 
of viabi lity, the media could have 
stil l somehow managed [Q make 

the race exciting and interesting, 
and thus get more viewers or read-
ers. But in reality, Edwards was 
fini shed long before March 2. 

Now that the important posi-
tion has been filled, attention 
turns to the number-two spot. 
Who will Kerry choose as his run-
ning mate? Media pundits are 
having a field day with rumors 
that Kerry will select Edwards. 
After all, why else would Edwards 
bow out just when Kerry was 
starting [Q get tired of him, and in 
his concession speech lavish praise 
upon the Massachusetts senator? 
Dean and Lieberman made no 
simi larly praise-laden speeches 
after their respective concessions, 
although it was clear even then 
that Kerry would soon clinch the 
nomination . An Edwards vice 
president spot may make for juicy 
speculation, but such a choice 
would make little real political 
sense. 

Kerry is being painted, rightly, 
as a flaming Northeastern liberal. 
His voting record is farther to the 
left than Sen. Ted Kennedy (D -
Mass.), according to National 
JOlin/ai, and that's going to hurt 
him in the general election. Vice 

presidents are supposed to fill in 
holes that the candidate himselfÂ· 
can't cover, and woo voting blocs 
that the front man can't appeal to. 
Edwards does not fit these criteria 
well. Sure, he 's from the South, but 
Edwards failed to win more than a 
single state there. 

" Speculation aside, Kerry 
stiU has mountains to 
climb if he wants to be 

president. H 
Speculation aside, Kerry still 

has mountains to climb if he wants 
to be president. Democratic strate-
gists and liberal columnists have 
made much of the polls showing 
Kerry either in a dead heat with or 
slightly ahead of President George 
w: Bush. What one must taxe into 
account is that polls are nothing 
but a snapshot of public opinion at 
a single moment in time. February 
polls will not matter in November. 

But there are important factors 

contributing to these polls. Most 
importantly, the Democratic candi-
dates have had the field to them-
selves for months. Debate after 
debate, speech after speech, and 
commercial after commercial bash-
ing President Bush have all gone 
unopposed . It is only logical that 
.Bush be running even with Kerry at 
the present moment. 

But things will change as the 
election nears. Even now, the Bush 
campaign has started to run TV 
ads, beginning what will surely be a 
hard-fought campaign. The presi-
dent has millions of dollars stored 
up, and his ability [Q raise much 
more is uncontested. The cam-
paign has not yet even begun in 
earnest, and to proclaim victory for 
Kc;rry now would be grossly irre-
sponsible. 

Money is not the only Bush 
resource. The situation in Iraq 
improves daily. More and more 
jobs are being turned over to 
Iraqis, and our counterinsurgency 
operations grow ever more suc-
cessful. As reported in the Feb. 9 
New York 7i"m, a recent letter 
written to Al-Qaeda leaders by a 
foreign terrorist operating inside 
Iraq cried out for help, complain-

more is beRer. 
more choices. more valle. more 11111tv. 

ing bitterly about the American 
successes in winning over the Iraqi 
people and bemoaning the success-
es in creating a new free Iraq. Also, 
despite what the mainstream media 
outlets portray, the economy has 
been rapidly improving. The 
unemployment rate has been on a 
steady decrease, from a high of 6.3 
percent last year to a current 5.6 
percent. 

All of these things added togeth-
er leave Bush in a very good posi-
tion come November. He will no 
longer have the luxury of running 
against Dean, who it was universal-
ly agreed would lose badly to the 
president. But Kerry is not much 
better. He has his post-Vietnam 
antics to account for, as well as his 
far-left votes in the Senate. And 
Kerry is not exactly an inspiring fig-
ure. Whatever can be said about 
Dean, he could at least connect 
with a crowd. Kerry. on the other 
hand, possesses no charisma. 

With the Democratic nominee, 
the campaign will quickly focus on 
the two men - Bush on one hand 
and Kerry on the other. With the 
nation divided upon familiar ideo-
logical grounds, the 2004 Election 
will be one to remember. 

~ I LETTER 
TO THE 
EDITOR 

Intelligent Design 
theory can beÂ·taught 

Editor: 
In "Public universities should not 

indoctrinate students" (Feb. 23), 
Chris Taylor incorrectly implies that 
it would be overly time-consuming 
to present the evidence in favor of 
intelligent design, or I.D., theory in 
a college-level biology class. 

Investigating the question 
"where we came from" brings US to 
core. scientific, philosophical and 
religious questions facing 
humankind. If we claim that a fair 
presentation of the scientific evi-
dence surrounding "where we came 
from" would take more time than is 
possible in a biology class, then 
education truly is devoted more to 
indoctrination than to teaching Stu-
dents to be I;esponsible citizens, 
critical thinkers and good skeptical-
ly-minded scientists. This is why, in 
2002, the U.S. Senate overwhelm-
ingly adopted (91 -8) the Santorum 
Amendment to the No Child Left 
Behind Act, which stated that 
"good science education should ... 
help students understand why [bio-
logical evolution) generates" con-
troversy. 

Much time could be spent learn-
ing the budding science of 1.0. But 
an introductory biology course could 
fairly cover the topic in a single lec-
ture. 

Taylor is correct about one thing: 
I.D. theory is typically given "little to 
no time in science courses. " For sru-
dents who want to know what they 
are missing, I invite them to check 
out the Intelligent Design and 
Evolution Awareness (I.D.EA.) 
Club here at UCSD. Please sec

Rally: Students submit lists of demands 
continued from page I 

percent." Black students at UCSD 
currently total 1 percent of the 
undergraduate population, the low-
est rate of all UC campuses. 

"We're here to show people 
that there are people of color on 
this campus, that we can all come 
together, that we can all work 
together," Student Affirmative 
Action Committee Chair Perse 
Hooper said. "Being 1 percent is a 
lonely, lonely percentage." 

The rally started with speakers 
at the bottom of the snake path, 
then continued as a silent march 
through Price Center, and stopped 
halfway down Library Walk near 
the Chancellors Complex, where 
the silence was broken and the list 
of demands was read. 

Presented by Black Srudent 
Union President Stephanie Akpa, 
the list demanded that the black 
population of srudents, faculty and 
staff at UCSD each reach at least 7 
percent to represent statewide 
demographics. The second demand 
was that student-initiated outreach 
become a priori ty of the universi ty. 

"We do what we can," Queer 
People of Color President Rigo 
Marquez said. "All of the SAAC 
organizations put on conferences to 
outreach to our communities ... We 
can 't do that anymore because our 
budget has been cut, and the uni-
versity doesn't want to take action." 

The demands asked for the ter-
mination of black individu~ls ' 
"scrutinization, tokenization and 
eroticization by neutral and parti-
san entities on campus. " 

"When we come to this univer-
sity, they send us photographs of a 
black man and a white guy," said 
Sixth College sophomore Chris 
Sweeten. "That's another way that 
this university tokenizes us. You 
can use us to be in a picrure but 
you can't let us into a classroom. 

You can be sure the university has 
all of our numbers on speed dial 
when it\; time for a photo op. 
Why? Because they want to claim 
that we're diverse. We're nowhere 
near being diverse." 

The demands included a quick 
response network and stronger 
sanctions against people who par-
ticipate in hate speech. Speakers 
cited the &4'" as an example. 

"It's such a beautiful thing 
today for all of us to come togeth-
er' for all of us Â·to recognize that 
we're different yet we're similar-

" You can be sure the 
university has all of our 
numbers on speed dial 

when. it's time far a 
photo Op." 

- ems Sweeten, 
Sixth College sophomore 

we struggle together as people of 
color, as minority groups, as peo-
ple struggling in this university to 
show our presence," said Jonathan 
Lego, Kaibigang Pilipino's vice 
chair internal. "It makes me angry 
to see things like the /(oa"', to see 
people not supporting us." 

Other demands included instat-
ing an African-American studies 
minor at UCSD; removing UC 
Regent W~rd Connerly from his 
position for his "hostility and 
opposition toward the advance-
ment of the black community;" the 
systemwide protection of financial 
aid; and increased funding for cul-
rural . educational and social pro-
grams, including the African-

American Recognition Ceremony. 
The last item on the list of 

demands called for the adminis-
tration to form an investigative 
committee to determine a reason 
for "t.he dismal number of under-
represented students at UCSD" 
and to create a plan of action to 
increase their admission rates. 

Bonnie Horstman, special assis-
tant to the chancellor, came to the 
group of srudents to receive the list 
of demands on behalf of Acting 
Chancellor Marsha A. Chandler. 
Horstman addressed the group, 
expressing Chandler's excuses for 
being unable to be present, and 
suggested sending a group of 10 
representatives to set up a meeting 
"to sit down with the chancellor 
and to discuss their demands and 
concerns .. . which [Chandler is) 
concerned about also." 

These suggestions did not go 
unanswered. 

"Representatives will be sent, 
we will bring our list of demands, 
we will seek a response, and if we 
don't see action backing up 
rhetoric, we'll be back," Akpa said. 

After presenting the demands, 
participants marched down 
Library Walk, this time chanting 
"Whose university? Our universi-
ty," and "Segregation's got to go." 
Some signs held up read "Still sep-
arate and unequal," "Keep koalas 
in Australia" and "Better campus 
climate now." 

The march ended in Price 
Center Plaza, where the demands 
were repeated. Several speakers 
took to the stage to address the 
srudents around. 

"If you don't see anything 
wrong, then something's wrong," 
Akpa said. "If you don't know why 
we're here, then you need to ask 
somebody. We're here because 
we're here, but we don't have a 
voice here."

began operating last fall. 

CampusBoox allows users to 
place a free advertisement for a 
book without registering or log-

includes the seller's contact infor-

transaction to take place.

Books on Campus charges the 

buyer and seller $2.50 fo r each 
successful transaction, amounti ng 
to fees of $5 per sale. O ut of that 
amount, A.S. will receive about $2. 

"I wanted the most of that fee 
possible going back to A.S. for sru-
dent programs and student organi-
zations," Cogan said . 

To sell a book or complete a

srudents must register with the site. 
A few days after a successful book

Expansion: Committee 
prefers 'Pinwheel' design 

continued from (Jage I 
and (every level] from the ground 
level to the top level allows con-
nections from the north to the 
south . " 

In the preliminary designs, the 
pinwheel scheme features a long 
flight of wide Spanish steps leading 
to the second fl oor of the new Price 
Center, on the southern edge of the 
expansion across from Matthews 
Quad. Modeled after the Spanish 
Steps in Rome, the steps would 
provide students with an additiona l 
outdoor area to congregate in. The 
expansion would also include mul-
tiple entrances from 
both the current 
Price Center and the 

" 

ing structure that is very distinc-
tive," Yazdani said. 

T he other two proposals -
"Terrace" and "Mobius" - would 
have rooftop terraces and a com-
pletely detached Price Center 
expansion, respectively. The two 
schemes drew zero and one votes in 
the straw poll, respectively. 

Committee members expressed 
that the lack of interior space in the 
Terrace scheme and the lack of con-
nection with the nearby campus in 
the Mobius scheme made them less 
desirable. 

T he committee chose the pin-
wheel design for 

surrounding areas, 
allowing for what 
University Centers 

, Director Ga ry 
Ratcliff described as 
a "porous, perme-
able space." The 
architects also dis-
cussed rooftop ter-
races on the four th 
floor.

level to the top 

level allows 

its accessibility 
and openness to

pus and its abun-

during the meeting. "I do like the

the proximity of the third tower to

The committee will reconvene

expansion.

Lederer believes that book 

swapping services should be free 
to students. 

"I feel, even if we weren't here 
doing it for free, that a S5 fee is 
going to be prohibitive for Stu-
dents using this service, especially 
initially," Lederer said. 

Jolm Muir College freshman 
Jon Chan purchased a book 
thr'ough CampusBoox and is 
using the site to list his Chemistry 
6 textbook. 

"It was easy to sign on and 
people called," Chan said. "I get 
more money off of selling (the 
book) to other students than to 
the Bookstore." 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Debbie Lee, however, 
has listed her Math 20C textbook 
on CampusBoox since January 
and has had no offers.

"It was kind of disappointing 
because I thought it was pretty 
well advertised," Lee said. "I thinle. 
a whole bunch of people list there, 
but very few people actually go to 
the site and buy." 

Established online services 
charge a commission for success-
ful transactions. Ha/fcom, a divi-
sion of eBay, charges as much as 
15 percent of the selling price. 
A11IIlzon.com deducts SO.99 plus 15 
percent of the item's price per 
transaction. Both merchants pro-
vide a shipping allowance of about 
S2. 

Cogan said that he hopes 
CampusBoox poses competition 
for the Books on Campus-
Associated Students venture so 
that students will have as many 
options as possible. 

"I just felt that there should be 
an option that is sanctioned by 

A.S. that is another option for stu-
dents to feel reliable and secure 
about," he said. 

According to Cogan, early 
estimates predict that Books on 
Campus might generate up to 
$6,000 a year for the A.S. 
Council. Cogan said that even if 
no one uses the service, it will 
not cost rhe cou nci l anything. 

Lederer sa id that his textbook-
swapping si te will remain free for 
students. 

Currently, Lederer and his 
team are advertising by passing out 
flyers on Library Walk and talking 
with students in residence halls. 

"At this point, other than 
recognition, there's nothing in it 
for us," Lederer said. "It's really a 
service [students] shouldn 't have 
to pay for."

confirm," Shah said. "We would 
get in contact with the managers 
who would say the band could do 
it, then find out later that they 
couldn't do it for some reason." 

Louis XIV opened WinterFest, 
followed by headliners Talib Kweli 
and Switchfoot. 

"I don't know much about the 
other two bands; I'm really going just 
to see Talib Kweli, who I'm really 
excited to see perform," Earl Warren 
sophomore Naomi Saelee said. "I 
would have wanted to see Chingy or 
Fabolous, but I don't think UCSD 
would be able to get them." 

The crowd of students at the 
arena floor screamed as Kweli per-
formed songs from his new album, 
The Beautiful Stmggle. He ended 
his set rapping to music from bands 
such as the Beatles and AI Green. 

Students ran do\l,'Il the stands to 
the arena floor as Switchfoot pre-
pared to take the stage. A wave of 
outstretched hands and lighters 
overtook the crowd as the band 
opened the act with their single 
"Dare You to Move."

Revelle Community Outreach 
raised $242 for Cystic Fibrosis 
research, a genetic disease that 
causes infants to develop life ~ 
threatening lung infections. The 
organization hosted the Chuck for

donors to throw pies at Revelle stu-
dents. 

"The goal was to have fun," 
Revelle Community Outreach Co-
chair and Revelle College sopho-

very public way of getting the com-
munity involved." 

SRTV, which filmed the UCSD 
Cares week, screened a documen-
tary about the event during 
WinterFest on March 5. 

The campaign raised over 
$11,000 in five days, according to 
organizers. In addition, Nikkei

paper cranes for cancer patients at

were built on Library Walk to raise 
awareness about homelessness, and 
Alpha Phi Omega made 179 hand-

Organizers hope neJtt years event ' 
will build on this years successes. 

"We're just glad that everyone 
came out to show that UCSD 
cares," UCSD Cares -committee 
member and Warren College 
sophomore Vincent Pascual said. 
"We hope more people will come 
out next year, and that more orga-
nizations will participate and build 
more community in terms of 
engaging and advancing communi-
ty service." 

UCSD Cares committee mem-
ber and Eleanor Roosevelt College 
freshman Jessica Mann said that 
plans for next year are already 
underway. 

"We learn something new every 
year," Mann said. "We already have 
plans for what we can do next year 
and how we can make next year's 
events better."

Decrease stress and stay 
healthy during finals week 

By KATHLEEN BAILES . 
Contributi~g Writer 

W ith less than a week to go before finals, nearly everyone can relate to the anxiety that accompanies 
this hectic week. Studying and stress, not to 
mention lack of sleep, can really push a stu-
dent to the edge, regardless of the fact that 
all of this tension and worrying is actually 
counterproductive. Staying healthy and 
stress-free while sntdying can be the key to 
success during finals week. 

There are many ways to relax by giving 
your mind a rest and your body a workout 
during finals. You can only sit still and study 
for so long before you start to burn out, so 
it's important not to neglect your body and 
to allow yourself time to be active in ways 
that you enjoy. Play some soccer with some 
buddies, ride a bike, go for a jog: engage in 
some kind of physical activity in order to 
reenergize yourselÂ£ 

Be sure to IPve yourself at least five min-
utes of eIercise time. "When used effectively, 
these few minutes can refresh you more than 
you might thinlc. For these five minutes, 
simply breathe. Sit cross-legged and relax 

your back and neck or lie down flat on the 
ground. Here's a tip: Breathe in slowly for 
the count of fOUI; hold that breath for two 
counts. Now exhale, counting to four again. 
Wait another two counts before you begin 
your next inhale. By concentrating on 
breathing deeply, slowly and evenly, the rest 
of your body is able to relax. 

UCSD's recreation programs offer a 
number of classes geared toward health and 
wellness,including yoga, meditation and 
massage therapy. Practices like these have 
been around for many years. Originally used 
to communicate with the divine, today they 
have become increasingly common ways to 
center yourself and free your mind from 
outside distractions. 

Although most of these classes wrap up 
during ninth week, a few continue into the 
week before finals. Find one that you think 
you might be interested in and stop by for 
one of the sessions. Most instructors would 
be happy to have you watch a class" or even 
sit in . However, like all activities, the 
longer you participate in one of these class-
es, the better you will get and the more

Get answers about 
sleep deprivation and 

muscle soreness 
To your 
health 

Neha Singh 
What are the effects of sleep 
deprivation? 

- Gabe Abadilla, E leanor 
Roosevelt College senior 

With busy schedules and an 
increasing lack of time, it is hard 
not to cut corners on the amount 
of sleep you get each night, 
However, it must be realized that 
sleep is as essential for your well-
being as food and water, and that a 
deficit of it can have serious phys-
ical and psychological conse-
quences. 

"When we look at the physical 
part of sleep deprivation, it can 
slow down your reaction time and 
decrease your level of alenness," 
said Dr. Brad Buchman, director 
of clinical services at Student 
Health Services, "These are also 
key elements that affect driving, 
Moreover, sleep deprivation caus-
es an impaired mental process, as 
well as an impaired ability to 
learn, People can withstand short 
bursts of not sleeping, but they 
can't sustain day after day, night 
after night of very little sleep, 
Lack of proper sleep sharply 
reduces your ability to assimilate 
new material, to process new 
information, to concentrate and 
to retain shon-term memory. It is 
very difficult to keep things 
straight. The psychological conse-
quences of little sleep include 
many symptoms, from being very 
irritable to being short-tem-
pered." 

With finals around the corner, 
you might laugh at the idea of get-
ting enough sleep. But not doing so 
might seriously hurt your chances 
of acing that chemistry final or 
writing an excellent sociology 
paper. So exactly how much sleep 
should you be getting? Buchman 
believes that there is no magic 
number of hours - you simply 
have to find out through trial and 
error. 

The effects of sleep deprivation 
can be very harmful if gone 
unchecked. Some studies have 
shown that sleep deprivation can 
affect your body's immune system 
in detrimental ways. The last thing 
you would want during finals week 
(or any week) is to get sick. 
Realistically, if you know you will 
not be getting enough sleep, try to 
make up for the loss as soon as pos-
sible. 

"If you must sleep a very short 
amount for a final, try to make it up 
as quickly as possible, especially if 
you have several finals in the week, " 
Buchman said, "Sleep deficit 
should be replaced as quickly as 
possible to minimize the conse-
quences." 

Recognizing the important side 
effects of a lack of sleep, try to 
spend a few more hours in your 
bed. In the end, you will be more 
refreshed and much more produc-
tive while getting tasks done, For 
more information on sleep depriva-
tion, be sure to visit the Student 
Health Services Web site at

Why am I sore after I work out 
at the 8)'111? How can I prevent 
and treat it? 

-Anonymous 

We have all experienced sore 
muscles the day after we push our-
selves a little too hard during a bas-
ketball game or lift too much in the 
weight room. nus soreness and 

pain after a tough workout are 
caused by a variety of reasons, 
including a buildup of lactic acid in 
the muscles and the overworking of 
muscles, 

Lactic acid is released by anaer-
obic exercise, After a workout, 
there can be a buildup of lactic acid 
in muscles. which. in part, leads to 
soreness in muscles , 

"While doing aerobic condi-
tioning or weightlifting, you're def-
initely exerting sufficient force on 
the muscles that causes some 
micro-trauma and micro-injury to 
them," Buchman said, "By lifting 
weights, youÂ· are pushing muscles 
beyond their ability to simply con-
tract. You are initiating an inflam-
mation and repair process, This 
inflammatory process produces a 
lot of chemicals or compounds that 
the nervous system picks up as sig-
nals, and perceives them as pain," 

There are several ways to pre-
vent soreness, including varying 
your exercise regimen, stretching, 
and not pushing yourself toO hard if 
you are just starting to work out. If 
you are weight tra.ining, start off 
using lighter weights with higher 
repetitions, If you are running, go 
for a lesser duration and intensity, 
Stay well-hydrated and do not for-
get about stretching, Muscles adapt 
much faster than tendons do, so a 
bicep might get really strong and 
start pulling on tendons that are 
attached to the bone, which causes 
inflammation. This can be avoided 
by stretching, Also, don't overtax 
the same muscle groups with the 
same exercises everyday. 

In addition, minimize your alco-
hol consumption, since the ability 
of the body to break down lactic 
acid and reduce soreness is 
decreased significantly by alcohol, 
which impairs the liver's ability to 
carry out metabolic reactions. 

If you notice pain right after 
your workout, rest and ice the 
afflicted area for 15 to 20 minutes, 
three to four times a day, Ice is 
most effective in the 72 hours fol-
lowing an injury. If tolerated, 
attempt a gentle range of motion in 
movement. If not allergic, consider 
taking Tylenol, Advil or Aleve, 
though you probably want to see a 
health care professional if symp-
toms persist. 

"Most muscle soreness peaks 48 
hours after a workout," Buchman 
said, "It may persist for up to a 
week, but it should start tapering 
down after the first 48 hours, 
Things should gradually get better 
over the next one-to-two weeks as 
long as you do .not keep provoking 
it. If soreness continues after more 
than a week, you might consider 
being seen by a health care 
provider."

cle soreness or to set up an appoint-
ment with a health care provider.

Off-campus: Great spots to 
study for finals outside UCSD 

continued from pagt I I 
are various public libraries located all 
around San Diego. Off-campus stu-
dents can visit public libraries in 
Balboa, Cannel Valley, Clairemont, 
Mira Mesa and Pacific Beach. 
Especially convenient for students 
wary of finding parking near Geisel 
Library, these libraries are quiet and 
most operate from noon to 8 p.m, on 
Mondays and Wednesdays, and 9:30 
3,m, to 5:30 p.m. on Tuesdays, 
Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. 

Other places to study in the 
presence of books are Barnes & 
Noble in Mira Mesa and Bookstar, 
located off Genessee and Nobel 
Drive. There is limited seating, but 
plenty of magazines and books to 
read and reference, not to mention 
a Starbucks inevitably nearby, 

For outdoor lovers, a trip to 
Balboa Park is a drive well-south of 
campus, but has enough restaurants, 
picnic tables and entertainment 
facilities to warrant a day-long trip, 

Students can find seating in the 
various recreational areas at picnic 
tables, or in nearby cafes and 

restaurants. To offset the stress of 
studying, the park features a many 
stunning gardens as well as numer-
ous amactions like museums, the-
aters and free concerts. A shorter 
drive south from campus can take 
you to the beaches of Mission Bay, 
Lined with picnic tables, barbecue 
pi ts and various water spotts, the 
beach can be accessed from Sea 
World Drive off Interstate 5. 

Other places to blissfully cram 
for exams are Powerhouse Parle and 
Seagrove Park in Del Mar. For stu-

.dents looking for a place closer to 
campus, Doyle Park on Regents 
Road, Standley Park on Governor 
Drive and the La Jolla Recreational 
Center on Prospect Place all have 
tables to study on, as well as basket-
ball courts and other recreational 
areas, 

Whether you live on or off cam-
pus, students itching to escape the 
confines of their rooms can find 
these study locations a great alter-
native and a perfect way to study 
while enjoying the sights, tastes and 
scents of San Diego.

owadays, yoga is used a a way to 
improve balance and concentra-
tion, and to relieve stress, as well as 
a method to maintain both phy ical 
and spiritual well-bei ng. 

Ashtanga yoga instructor J eff 
',Imperato, who has been teaching 
yoga at UCSD for four years, knows 
the benefits of this ancient practice. 

"The mental benefits are at least 
as, if not more important, than the 
physical benefi ts," said Imperato. 

According to Impera to, yoga 
leads to an increased lung capaci ty, 
stronger and more fl exible muscles, 
quicker recovery time from 
injuri es, increased patience and 
focus on goals, and a greater ability 
to relax, even in stressful si nlations. 

UCSD's recreation deparonent 
offers almost 20 different sessions 
and four different disciplines of yoga 
(Ashtanga, Hatha, Iyengar and 
Kundalini), all of which emphasize 
different aspects of the practice. 

Meditation, which, like yoga, 
also originated in the East in coun-
tries like India, China and Japan , 
has also become an exceedingly 
common practice in Western life. 
Meditation seeks to offer enlight-
enment and serenity through relax-

ation by means of breathing and 
concentration. The benefits of 
meditation are more abundant than 
one might think. Meditation lowers 
the heart and respiratory rate, and 
promotes lower blood pressure and 
less muscle tension. 

"Intro to Meditation" and 
"Mind/Body Techniques for 
Li festyle Change" are two recre-
ation department classes offered 
through UCSD. There are also 
various workshops offered all over 
campus throughout the year, 

A practice derived from ancient 
Mediterranean civiliz,'ltions, mas-
sage therapy is manual soft tissue 
manipulation of another by apply-
ing pressure in order to positively 
affect their well-being. When 
applied correctly, massage therapy 
can increase the oxygen capacity of 
the blood and both stimulate and 
loosen muscles according to the 
need of the individual. In addition, 
massage also relieves stress. 

T he UCSD recrea tion depart-
ment offers classes to teach how to 
give and receive a massage. A vari-
ety of private ma sages are offered 
through the Student Wellness 
Program and vary in price. 

These practices, if utilized 
throughout the quarter, are exceUent 
ways to maintain a positive mental 
well-being by relaxing the mind and 
working the body. But even if these 
classes aren't for you, you can find 
ways to relax on your own. 

"Set aside time to do things you 
really enjoy, especially physically. 
Ultimately, it's not lost time, 
because these practices give back 
energy," Imperato sa id. 

Take time to breathe and to 
relax. Allow yourself ,to let go and 
have fun. Reali ze that studying 
non-stop is not the best way to do 
well on exams.

Softball: 
Pitcher 

Bryant earns 
first victory 

continued from page 20 
started it off with a home run, and 
we JUSt went from there," Gerckens 
said. "Kelley pitched an incredible 
game, and I'm proud of her; shes 
doing a great job. Its our offense 
that is having problems; we either 
don't score any runs, or we score a 
lot. We need to learn to continually 
perfonn in pressure situations. In 
that first game, we should have 
scored at least one nrn." 

Bryant earned her first victory of 
the season, throwing a complete 
game and only giving up one 
unearned run. The victory improved 
her record on the year to 1- 1. 

"We had strong defense. I had a 
lot of confidence with my team-
mates behind me," Bryant said. "I 
feel like I can let the batters hit it 
and my defense will take care of the 
rest." 

UCSD's bats didn't cool off 
overnight, as they immediately 
sprung back into action for the first 
game on March 6 against Sonoma 
State, winning 9-1 in six innings. 

Bryant once again threw a com-
plete game and earned another vic-
tory, bringing her record to 2-1 on 
the season. 

"Our pitching staff is doing 
their job. I ts great to see Kelley 
step up; she pitched two complete-
ly great games this weekend," 
Gerckens. said. 

The Tritons' offensive charge 
was led by Hurst, who went tWo-
for-four and scored twice, once on 
her two-run home run, evoking the 
mercy rule in the sixth inning. Her 
two-run bomb was her third of the 
season. She was joined by Cope, 
who provided a three-run home 
run in the fifth inning, her fourth 
of the season. 

UCSD scored six in the fifth 
inning, including Cope, Aggabao, 
Franciscus, Hurst, sophomore 
rightfielder Nib Anderson and 
Bland. Aggabao went 2-for-3, and 
scored rwice, while sophomore 
rightfielder Niki Anderson \vent 1-
for-2 and scored once, while 
knocking in two runs. 

"We're playing really strong as 
a team," Cope said. "We can't win 
with individuals, it's a team effort ... 
that's what I attribute our succes'S 
to. We 're playing reall y well 
together," 

The Tritons once again bested 
the Seawolves in the nightcap 011 
March 6, with a score of 6-3 . 

Bland got her due, throwing a 
complete game, and only giving up 
one earned run. She improved her 
record to 6-6 on the season, and 
was helped by some much needed 
run support. 

Mettee agai n staned the game 
with a leadoff home nrn, her fourth 
of the year. Sonoma State jumped 
out to a short-lived lead in the third, 
making it 3-1, but UCSD responded 
with two runs of its own in the third. 
Hurst doubled to score Aggabao, 
who singled, and then Bland hit a 
sacrifice fly to right field to score 
Hurst from third base. 

Cope doubled to start the 
fourth, and scored on a Muerer 
single. Hurst provided a single that 
scored Mettee, who singled earlier 
to get on. In the sixth, Cope carne 
through again, netting a single that 
scored Bland. For the day, Cope 
was 3-for-3, with a run and an RBI, 
while Hurst went 2-for-3 and 
scored one whi le bringing in two. 
Mettee also went 2-for-3, scoring 
twice and knocking in one. 

"We worked a lot on hitting in 
the fall, and it's paid off," Gerckens 
said. "But I still think we win or 
lose with defense, Our offense is 
working, but they shouldn't have 
scored as ma ny runs as they did, 
even if it's only four runs. However, 
for now, as long as we score a lot of 
runs, we can get away with it."

18 SPORTS THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Men's basketball ends season 
Sweany drops 27 points in loss to C SU SB 

By MATT RYAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team played solidly over the last 
two weeks of the season, and 
despite losing to two of the top 
teams in the league on March 6 and 
March 7, the Tritons played deter-
mined and inspired basketball and 
did not go down without a fight. 

On March 6, the Tritons trav-
eled to play California Collegiate 
Athletic Association champion Cal 
State San Bernardi no, who boasted 
a national best 30-game home win-
ning streak. In front of a hostile 
crowd, UCSD gave everything it 
had, but came up short in its 88-76 
loss. 

Cal State San Bernardino got 
out to a fast start and held a 14-
point advantage midway through 
the fir t half, but the horne team 
went ice cold as UCSD reeled off 
10 straight points to narrow the 
lead to 35-3 1. Coyote Curtis 
WIlliams, however, hit a shot with 
3 Jrunu tes and 5 seconds left to 
stOP the Tritons' momentum. The 
Coyotes took a 10-point lead, 45-
35, to close out the first half. 

UCS D came out in the second 
half fired up, cumng the Coyote' 
lead to 47-43 on freshman guard 
Adam Rei nking's basket with 16:55 
to go. The Coyotes, however, 
showed why they are conference 

champions and came back, going 
up 55-45 . The Tritons were relent-
less and another charge brought 
UCSD to within four points at 58-
54 on a basket by sophomore guard 
Matthew Sweany. 

Freshman forward Parker 
Berling hit a deuce with 2:10 left to 
reduce the margin again to four at 
78-74, but two free throws by Cal 
State San Bernardino and a UCSD 
turnover that led to a Coyote bas-
ket made the score 82-74. UCSD 
was forced to foul and the Coyotes 
calmly hit six free throws down the 
stretch to ice the game and end the 
Tritons' attempt at an upset. 

UCSD out-rebounded the 
Coyotes, 32-29, but committed 16 
turnovers to Cal State San 
Bernardino's 10. 

The Coyotes shot 58 percent 
for the game (30 of 52) and were 7-
for-15 from three-point range (47 
percent). They needed to overcome 
the long-range bombing of the 
Tritons, who put up 29 three-point-
ers - 10 of which were successful 
- with five by sophomore 
Matthew Sweany, the leading scor-
er on the night with 27 points. 
Reinking fini shed with 17 and 
Berling chipped in II . 

UCSD then traveled to 
Pomona, Calif., to take on the Cal 
Poly Pomona Broncos. UCSD 
almost pulled off the upset, but 
fell just short at 71-66.

but battled all the way back to trail 
by only two points with less than a

onds on the clock sealed the 
Bronco victory. 

The Tritons ended their season 
with two losses and finished 9-18 
overall.

T he UCSD women's basketball 
team earned a split in the final 
weekend of the regular sea on with 
a 49-40 win, over Cal tate an 
Bernardino on March 5 and a 69-59 
loss, to second-ranked Cal Poly 
Pomona. The games moved the 
Tritons' record to 15- 12 overall and 
II - II in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. Cal State San 
Bernardino dropped to 10- 16 over-
all and 7- 14 in the CCAA, while 
Cal Poly Pomona improved to 21-6 
overall and 17-5 in the CCM. San 
Bernardino finished second in the 
CCM to Cal State Baker field . 

T he Tritons shot the ball poor-
ly against Cal State San 
Bernardino, gemng out-shot 42 
percent to 25 percent, but man-
aged to keep the score tied at half-
time, 24-24. 

UCSD improved its shooting 
percentage in the second half rela-
tive to Cal State San Bernardino, 
who was only shooting 18 percent 
as compared to UCSD's 42 per-
cent. Despite the fact that it was 
the Tritons' second-lowest scoring 
game, their defensive performance 
held up and they managed to win, 
49-40.

Tritons with \3 points and junior

in UCSD's wins that weekend. 

Sequoia Williams had a game-
high 17 points for Cal State San 
Bernardino and grabbed 10 boards. 

UCSD finished its season 
against a very tough Cal Poly 
Pomona team, and despite trailing 
throughout the first half, they ral-
lied to tie the score, 33 -33, before 
halftime. 

The Tritons continued to play 
well at the start of the half as they 
went on a 5-0 run, but the 
momentum switched directions as 
the Broncos went on an 11-0 run 
that gave them a six point lead. 
The Broncos never looked back, 
as balanced scoring led to a 69-59 
victory. 

Cal Poly Pomona had five play-
ers score in double digits. Keila 
Beachem led the team with 13 
points. rThe team's top sCorer (also 
the NCAA Division -II leading

Women's water polo splits 
a pair of matches at home 

UCSD defeats Claremont College, 8-2; 
loses to Loyola Maryrnount, 8-3 
By DANIEL DIAl 

Staff \Miter 

The No. 14 UCSD women's 
water polo team saw how quickly the 
tables can turn on victory at 
Canyonview Pool on March 6, as the 
Tritons stuffed C laremont College, 
8-2, then succumbed to No. 9 
Loyola Marymount in a blistering 
fourth-quarter comebaclc., 8-3 . 

The Tritons' record now stands 
at 9-11. The loss to Western Water 
Polo Association rival LMU 
lmocked UCSD's conference 
record to 1-2, but with the Feb. 21 
win over UC Davis, the Tritons 
hold an advantage in the confer-
ence standings. 

In the fourth quarter of the after-
noon match, LMU's Jamie Kroeze 
and Stacia Peterson scored in succes-
sion to pad their lead, 6-3, and stymie 
the Tritons' charge, inspired by senior 
captain two-meter defender Meris 

Bantilan-Srnith~ man-up goal that cut 
the deficit to one. Devon Wright hit a 
pai for the Lions in the last twO min-
utes of the game to hold offUCSD. 

"We were at the right point. 
[We needed] to score another 
goal," UCSD head coach Larry 
Sanders said. "LMU went up 6-3 
and we were working hard, but not 
getting anything." 

The Tritons held the Lions to 
within one for the better part of 
three quarters, but they never came 
into the lead, mounting two come-
backs ending with Banti lan-Smith 
scores that cut the deficit to 2-1 in 
the first quarter and 4-3 in the third 
quarter. 

"We played three great quar-
ters. We played tough and aggres-
sive, and while we still need to do 
tha t for the whole game, we'll still 
continue to progress," Sanders said. 

Bantilan-Srnith's hat-trick 
accounted for all ofUCSD's scoring. 
Wright led LMU with four goals, 
while Kroeze, Rebecca Peterson, 
Stacia Peterson, Teresa Guidi and 
Jessica Conner each had one. 

The loss prolongs a four-year 
drought for the Tritons, who haven't 
beaten LMU since the implementa-
tion of the NCAA Championships in 
1999. The Lions also spoiled 
UCSD~ Final Four bids the last two 
seasons, defeating the Tritons 8-4 in 
2002 and 8-6 in the 2003 WWPA 
Championshi p Games. 

Despite junior uti lity Tobi 
Lymans effort as she finished her 
ejection penalty, LMU's Conner 
converted a six-on-five goal to take a 
2-0 lead, which was cut to one after 
Bantilan-Srnith took a pass at four-
meter, shook off two defenders, and 
scored to get UCSD on the board. 

The Lions drew another ejection 
later in the quarter and attempted to 
hit the near-post man again, but 
senior goalie Stephanie Lombardo 

was there for the stop. the first of 
three such power-play shutdowns for 
the Tritons. Lombardo and sopho-
more goalie Kaitlin Foe combined 
for 11 saves. Aggressive two-meter 
defense and heavy outside blocking 
also helped to keep the Lions score-
less throughout the second quarter. 

UCSD was also persistent in 
creating second chances on its pos-
sessions. improving on an issue that 
Sanders cited as being detrimental 
in previous losses. 

"We played aggressive .. . they 
went up by two and we could charge 
back," Sanders said. "The intensity 
made the offense much better." 

He also credited the role of 
Banti lan-Smith in moving the 
attack. 

"Meris [Bantilan-Smithj is learn-
ing how to lead; she sees whats hap-
pening and is learning to motivate 
her teammates." Sanders said. 

The Lions extended their lead 
to 4-1 within the span of two min-
utes, as an LMU shot bounced off 
the top post into the goa l and Guidi 
converted on a power play with 
3:45 left in the third . 

But on the very next possession, 
freshman two-meter Natalie 
Hockett drew a four-meter penalty 
shot that Bantilan-Smith bounced 
into the near corner with case. After 
drawing an ejection with 18 seconds 
left in the third, Sanders strategically 
sent in his whole first line, who. pass-
ing with poise and accuracy. found 
Bantilan-Smith at two-meters to 
again pull the Tritons Within one. 

The morning game against 
Claremont was more preparation 
for LMU than a contest. as 
Sanders, comfortable with a 3-0 
lead over the Division III Athenas, 
substituted gratuitously by the end 
of the first period, and had all his 
starters out by the half. 

"It was more of a warm-up and 
stretch-out," Bantilan-Smi th said . 
"We knew it wouldn't be difficult, 
but we have to take teams seriously, 
no matter how good they are." 

The second string got its chance 
to shine, breaki ng off the bench 
rust by the third quarter and ta lly-
ing five goals in the space of 3:39. 
Junior utility Courtney Clevenger 
led the Tritons with three goals, 
and Hockett and sophomore driver 
Flynn LaRochelle each added a 
pair on top of senior two-meter 
Lesha Bounds' goal. C laremont's 
Ji ll ian Kurvers and Ann ie 
Richardson both hit their consola-
tion goa ls in the fourth quarter. 

The competition will get 
tougher as the Tritons play host to 
Princeton on March 12 at 6 p.m. 
before going head-to -head on 
March 13 with defending NCAA 
champion and No. 3 UCLA at 9 
a.m. and No. 4 Long Beach State 
at 4 p.m. at Canyonview Pool.

mized results from its intensive 
training. 

"We have been looking forward 
to this meet for quite a whi le, so we 
rested people in preparation for 
t his one and made sure we 
deployed our people to score as 
effectively as possible," Salerno 
said. 

Expectations are high given the 
exceptional level of competition 
UCSD offered to a slew of Division 
I sister-school rivals. 

While head coach Salerno pre-
dicts strong results, he also senses 
heigh tened competition from 
accomplished teams with diverse 
talents. 

"The men should have a fairly 

successfu l meet on March 13 
(against San Diego State] ... Ibut] 
the women have it a bit tougher, n 
Salerno said: 

Both the UCSD men's and 
women's teams will be back in 
action at the March 13 San Diego 
City Championships against a var-
ied fie ld of opponents, including 
Ca l State San Marcos, Point 
Lorna Nazarene and crosstown 
rival Division I San Diego State. 

"They are a very good Division 
I-caliber team. but our depth may 
keep us close against them," 
Salerno said about the Aztecs. "Our 
women's team was just a few points 
away from beating them last year 
and we are a much better program 
this year than last."

Women's tennis beats CCAA rival 
Tritons get revenge after losing twice to Cal Poly Pomona 

By ANGELA UN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD womens tennis team 
took revenge on rival Cal Poly 
Pomona, defeating the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
champions, 8-1, at the Northview 
Tennis Courts on March 6. The win 
marked a huge victory for the 
Tritons, who were defeated by the 
Broncos twice last year - once in 
the regular season and another in the 
finals of the CCM . Championship 
Tournament. 

"We came out fired up and men-
tally tough ," senior captain Julie 
Westerman said . "This was a match 
we've been wanting to win all sea-
son, so we were focused and ready." 

The Tritons' doubles teams, 
which have been consistently 
improving throughout the season, 

demonstrated their strength by 
defeating all three of Cal Poly 
Pomonas doubles teams with rela -
tive ease. At No. 1 doubles, 
Westerman and junior Jasmin Dao 
defeated their opponents. 8-2; 
sophOl'lore Tara Siddiqui and fresh-
man Kristin Bronowicki defeated 
their opponents, 8-3, at No.2 dou-
bles; and at No.3, sophomore Leigh 
Roberts and freshman Katie McKee 
were able to win their match in a 
quick 8- 1 set. 

"We were playing really well in 
doubles, we were all communicat-
ing and using each person's 
strengths to help win our matches," 
Westerman said. 

At singles, the only loss came at 
the No. 1 position, in which Cal 
Poly POITIOna'S Dehlia Feliz, last 
years All-CCAA First Team selec-
tion, defeateJ Westerman in a tough 

Dynlmk duo: Freshman Katie McKee (front) and partner sophomore Leigh 
Roberts teamed up to defeat their Cal Poly Pomona counterparts, 8-1. 

6-2 and 6-4 victory. Dao was able to 
win her match, 6-1 and 6-3, at No. 2 
singles, and both Roberts and 
sophomore Marissa HiJlc.er were able 
to defeat their opponents, 6-0, in the 
first set, with Roberts closing her 
match out at 6-3 and Hilker defeat-
ing her opponent, 6-2, in the second 
set at No. 3 and No. 4 singles, 
respectively. Both No. 5 senior 
Kristina Jansen and No. 6 McKee 
had no trouble defeating their oPPO-
nents;Jansen finished her match off. 
6-0 and 6-1, and McKee defeated 
her opponent, 6-1 and 6-0. 

The victory bumped the Tritons' 
season record to 8-2 overall. Their 
second loss came from Division I 
Cal State Fullerton on March 4. 

Despit~ the lopsided final match 
score, 6-1 , the Tri tons had very close 
matches in the si ngles lineup. 

The lone win came from Dao, 
who split sets with Fullerton's Gina 
Le, 3-6 and 7-5, and was able to 
defeat Le in a super tiebreaker 
third set, 10-8. At No.3, Roberts 
was able to split sets with her oppo-
nent, Ioana Sisoe, 6-0 and 4-6, but 
lost the last set 6- 1. Siddiqui, who 
played N o.6 singles, was also able 
to force her ma tch to three sets, 
defeating her opponent, 7 -6, in the 
first set, then lost the next set 4-6, 
and the super-tiebreaker, 10-2. 

"Every girl had to playa tough 
opponent; the individual scores 
were closer than the final score," 
Westerman said. "But what we 
learned from the match is that no 
matter who the opponent is, 
D ivision I or Division III, we have

Slip and slide: Senior pitcher Jodie Bland (above) slides into second 
against San Francisco State on March 5 at Triton Softball Field. 

By JOE SPANO on - the mental part of the first 
Senior Staff Writer game," head coach Patti 

UCSD won three of its four 
game this past weekend, splitting 
a doubleheader on March 5 with 
San Francisco State and sweeping 
Sonoma tate for two on March 6 
at Triton Softball Field. 

The Tritons starred off the 
doubleheader against San 
Francisco State with a heart-
breaking luss in the first game on 
March 5, a 1-0 defeat. Senior 
starter Jodie Bland once again 
suffered a difficult 10 s, bringing 
her season record to 5-6, despite 
a complete game performance 
and the fact that the only run of 
the game wa unearned. 

Unfortunately for Bland, 
UCSD offered her little run sup-
port, sc rapping out only two hits 
for the game, which carne from 
sophomore first baseman Desiree 
Franciscus and freshman center-
fielder Brittni Carino. 

"Jodie pitched awesome, she 
pitched as well as Kelley Bryant 
[junior starting pitcher], but this 
is something that we're working 

Gerckens said. "We just don't 
core any runs, and then come 

back in the second game and rack 
up the runs. It's just not fair." 

For all the offensive difficulty 
the Tritons had in the first game, 
their bats exploded in the second 
game, as ~ey easily handed the 
Gators an 8-1 loss. Senior third 
baseman Amy Menee started off 
the game in style with a leadoff 
home run, her third overall on 
the season. The Tritons scored 
two more in the first inning, as 
freshman designated player 
Melanie Muerer was knocked in 
on a double by junior catcher 
Jamie Hurst, who scored later in 
the inning herself. 

The floodgates opened in the 
fifth inning as junior leftfielder 
Breanne Cope, Muerer, senior 
shortstop Kim Aggabao, Hurst 
and Franci cus all provided insur-
ance runs to give the Tritons their 
eight total. 

"In the second game, Amy

Baseball tears up 
Toros three times 
Tritons wrap up weekend 
with 13 -9 overall record 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team 
took on Cal State Dominguez 
Hills in a four-game series March 
4 through March 6. The Tritons 
rallied in game one to earn the 
victory in extra innings, 6-5 . The 
Toros then battled back in game 
two as they came from behind to 
defeat UCSD, 12-9. The series 
then moved north to Carson, 
Calif. , where the Tritons pro-
ceeded to crush Dominguez Hills 
in consecutive games of a double-
header, 19-9 and 10-3. 

In the first game on March 4, 
junior centerfielder Brad Beltz, 
who entered the game as a pinch-
runner in the eighth inning, 
opened the 10th inning with a 
triple to left-center that barely 
eluded senior Toro leftfielder 
Jason Flores as he made a diving 

attempt for it. Then, junior third 
baseman Alex Gascon poked a 
base hit to right field to drive in 
Beltz and secure the victory. 

Triton sophomore hurler 
Ryan Leake earned the win in 
relief of starting sophomore 
pitcher Byron Grubman, throw-
ing 2.2 innings of scoreless base-
ball to improve to a perfect 3-0. 
Grubman, coming off his second 
complete game this season, 
allowed 12 hits and five runs over 
7.1 innings of work. He walked 
one and struck out four. Leake 
also walked one and struck out 
three Toro batters. 

Sophomore rightfielder 
Damian Fante was 3-for-5 for the 
Tritons, while junior first base-
man Brian Robinson added a pair 
of hits, including an RBI single,

Duckworth 
ties for third, 
extends top 

10 streak 
By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team finished 
fourth out of 16 teams at the Cal 
State San Marcos Invitational on 
March 1 and March 2 at the San 
Luis Rey Downs in San Marcos, 
Calif. 

The Tritons, who are ranked 
sixth nationally among Division II 
teams, continued to finish in the 
top half of their tournaments, 
despite competing against non-
Division II schools. 

"The course itself wa pretty 
reasonable," head coach Mike 
Wydra said. "But the weather was 
just dismal. It rained both days, 
creating flooded low points and 
soggy greens. The ball just wasn't 
rolling right." 

Despite the difficult conditions, 
the Tritons sti ll managed to shoot 
rounds of 303 , 291 and 302 for a 
total of 896, or 32 over par. The 
291 UCSD shot on March 1 was 
the low score of the invitational for 
that round. 

"The guys have made a habit of 
shooti ng the low round in our 
tournaments lately, and I hope they 
keep that up," Wydra said. 

Of the three teams who topped 
UCSD, tourney host Cal State San 
Marcos tool a first place finish, 
turning in rounds of 293, 295 and 
298 to end up with 886, 22 over par. 

Johnson and Wales University 
took second, with rounds of 299,296 
and 296 to give them an 891, 27 over 
par. Point Lorna Nazarene shot 
rounds of 295, 295 and 302 to give 
them a total of 892, 28 over par. 

Individually, . junior Brian 

Track and field take on Division I opponents 
Duckworth tied (or a third-place 
overall finish. Duckworth shot 
rounds of 71,70 and 77 for a 218, 
two over par. His 70 was the low 
score for the round and put him in 
a tie for first place after March 1. 
This was Duckworth's third top-10 
finish in his last three tournaments. 

Women's team places second, men's team takes third overall 
By MICHAEL SCHOECK 

Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD track team dis-
played its strength in a striking, 
record -breaking performance at 
the annual All-Cal Challenge 
Cup track and field champi-
onships at UC Irvine. The team 
competed against UC Irvine, 
UCLA, UC Riverside and UC 
Santa Barbara, with several indi-
vidual s ga rnering NCAA 
Championship provisional quali-
fying marks. 

The UCSD women finished 
the competition second to VCSB, 
while the men's side finished third, 
scoring 197 points and losing to 
UCI and UCSB. 

"Being the only non-scholar-
ship team as well as the only 
Division II team among Division I 
schools made our success today 
even more significant," head coach 
Tony Salerno said. 

The qualifying marks helped 
UCSD outperform and defeat 
many of the Division 1 opponents 
that competed at the event. 

". am proud of how all of our 

people competed against some 
tough Division I level competi-
tion," Salerno said. "I can't say 
enough a bout our performance 
across the board." 

The Triton women totaled 199 
points, 54 points behind Division I 
rival UCSB and nine points ahead 
of UCI. 

UC Davis and UC Riverside 
were far behind; they finished 
fourth and fifth at 154 and 146 
points, respectively. 

Sophomore Kaylin Siever of 
the triple jump event and senior 
Michelle Beebe, a javelin thrower, 
were event winners for the 
Tritons. 

Junior Meredith Perry set a 
UCSD school record in the pole 
vault at II feet, 9.75 inches LO take 
second place. In addition, Perry's 
performance earned her an NCAA 
Championshjp provisional qualify-
ing mark. 

"Perry was the outstanding 
performer for the women today," 
Salerno said. 

Outranking UCSD on the 
men's side were UC Irvine and 
UCSB, who came in first and sec-

ond with 269.5 and 225.5 points, 
respectively. 

UC Davis was fourth at 156 
points, with UC Riverside a dis-
tant fifth with 99 points. 

Senior steeplechaser Julian 
Nahan's performance of 9 min-
utes, 22.40 seconds was an NCAA 
Division II provisional qualifying 
performance along with sopho-
more Mike Cunningham's 400 
hurdle mark of 53.20. 

"Our athletes really took the 
program to a new level with their 
performances today," Salerno 
said. 

In track and field competitions, 
event winners and those scored in 
multiple events are always consid-
ered the standouts in a scoring 
meet. 

"[Sophomore] Brad Libuit's 
throw to win the javelin was a 16-
foot personal record and came 
within a few inches of the school 
record," Salerno said. 

The coaching staff made sure 
the team was well-prepared, but 
also well-rested to ensure maxi-

All-Cal Challenge Cup. 

"Brian had a chance to win the 
tournament if he had been able to 
just par three holes that he had aver-
aged birdie on in an earlier round," 
Wydra said. "Unfortunately, he went 
bogey, bogey, bogey." 

Junior Joe Dolby returned to 
play for the Tritons after not com-
peting in UCSD's last tournament, 
and quickly made his presence felt 
with a top-10 finish. His rounds of 
75, 71 and 75 earned him a 221, five 
over par, and a tie for eighth overall. 

Senior Alan Scheer tied for 25 th 
place, turning in rounds of 79, 76 
and 72 to give him a 227, 11 over 
par.

the fourth spot for the Tritons, 
with rounds of 78, 74 and 78. His 
230, 14 over par, earned him a tie 
for 37th place. 

Junior Jan Godoski rounded out 
UCSD's team, shooting rounds of 
79,76 and 79. Finishing with a 234, 
18 over par, he tied for 54th place.
