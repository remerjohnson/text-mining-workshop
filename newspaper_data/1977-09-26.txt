Appeals for South 
African divestment 
rejected by Regents 

by Mark Stadler 
The UC Board of Begents have 

rejected a proposal tblt the 
Univenlty sell ita invettmenta in 
companies wbich lAo business with 
South Africa. 

During their Sept. 16 meetinC in 
Los Angeles the Regents instead 
approYed formation of a lIM'Cial 
committee to delineate an official 
position on UC's social respon-
sibilities. 

from Gregory Bateson, John 
Henning, stanley ScheinbalDD, 
Yorl Wada, stooent regent Michael 
Salerno and Dymally. 

In re jecPng divestment the 
Regents followed the advice of 
their investments conunittee and 
of Treasurer Hammond. The in-
vestments committee, after 
hearing argmnents for and against 
the proposal, o.-ed instead for a 
revision of the method by which UC 
votes its stock in corporate proxy 
fights. 

The new method, approved by 
the full Board, allows each Regent 
to help decide how UC votes its 
stock in each proxy fight. Before, 
UC's stock was voted by Ham-
mond, who regularly sided with the 
management position.

The RegerU have invested in 35 
companies-active in South Africa; 
the investments amount to about 
$555 million, or over 50 percent of 
the University's total investment 
portfolio. Less than one percent of 
those companiel' holdings il 
represented by businea with South 
Africa, aceordJnc to UC Treaurer 
Owsley Hammond. 

PlelletU.e 
The Regents' debate preceding 

the vote on divestment centered 
around UC's role u a moral leader 
in the world today. Henning, who 
wu recently appointed to the 
board by Gov. Brown, said, "UC's 
connection with South Africa, 
which is one of the ~08t despicable 
societies in the world today, is 
shameful before the free world."

greeted with derision by IIWl)' of

The .. -4 ..... I:. ..... :.~ 
margin in last Tuesday's local offered by Lt. Gov. Mervin 

Dymally, an ex4icio board 
member, who said the Regents' 
decision should not be baaed on 
financial considerations, but on the 
moral implications of UC in-
vestments in a country deeply 
rooted in apartheid practices. 

they have no control oftr what 
occurs in South Africa to similar 
statements made by corporations 
active in Nazi Gennany in the 

1~. 

. election, San Diego voters 
reconunended ending the three-
year experiment in legal nude 
bathing at Black's, which is 
located to the west of UCSD. 

The council should take action on 
the matter within one month. 

City Councilman Gil Johnson, 
whose First District includes 
UCSD, won a position in the Nov. 8 
runoff election with 47.5 percent of 
the vote. His opponent will be Bill 
Mitchell, who took 27.5 percent. 

Dymally's proposal had the 
support of many student groups. 
Student protest against UC in-
vestments came to a head last 
spring when demonstrations on 
several Cal.lfornia campuses 
resulted in mass arrests. (No 
arrests occurred at UCSD, where 
350 people marched to the Olan-
cellor's complex to protest the 
investments. ) 

"The University must take a 
position of moral leadership. No 
matter how you rationalize it, 
today UC is on the side of evil, and 
againsL the force of history," he 
said. 

Salerno said that "since we're all 
against apartheid, the question 
boils down to whether we're going 
to lose some money. If we had 
investments in Nazi Germany, 
would we refuse to divest ourselves 
of them because we might lose 
money?" 

The presence of Proposition D-
the ballot proposal to end the 
swimsuit optional status of 
Black's-was given credit for a 
voter turnout of almost 43 percent, 
which was 10 percent higher than 
nonnal for such an election, ac-
cording to County Registrar of 
Voters R.T. Denny. 

Stanwood Johnson, chairman of 
the committee fonned to support 
Prop D, called the Proposition's 
passage an upset, because "our 
opponents outspent us three to one 
and the early polls showed us 
taking it on the chin." 

·Robert Jacobs, chairman of the 
Nude Beaches Committee, said the 
council may not vote to rescind the 
nude bathing because of the 
closeness of last week 's balloting. 

The other incumbent Coun-
cilman seeking reelection, Floyd 
Morrow of District Five, gained a 
position in the runoff, but finished 
second to challenger Fred 
Schnaubelt, by a 33 percent to 31 
percent margin. 

Advisory Vote 
Three More Props 

Dymally's proposal drew six 
affirmative votes, out of the 18 
Regents present at the meeting, 

UC investments in South Africa 
condone the society there, he said. 

[Continued OD .. ge 10] 

Because the vote is only an 
advisory vote and so not binding on 
the City Council, the burden of 
deciding the beach's fate is placed 
on the council once again. 

It was the aty .Council which 

In addition to Prop D and three 
other city propositions, voters

Faucets shut off 
A drought at UCSD? Campus attempts to save water 

by Laura A. Richter 
NewaEdJtor 

"The situatioo is only going to get worse," 
predicted Bill Pettus, UCSD Energy Con-
servation Coordinator. Pettus explained the 
precarious nature of San Diego'l water 
supply and the measurel which were 
recertly taken to COIlIeI'Ve water on cam-
pus. 

Hot water faucets at UCSD have been 
turned off, but IIlOIt of the adjustments to 
the water shortace are much lell apparent, 
said Pettul. Control diaphragml in 
automatic toilet nush valves and reduced 
now shower heads in student housing and 
the gym were installed in an effort to 
achieve the 30 per cent reduced water usage 
goal for this year. 

Although Pettus finds himself 
''pessimistic about our society'. ability to 
respond," he said that most of the people 
involved in the trial program conducted on 
Matthews Campus have been willing to 
adjust to reduced water availability. "A 
larIe part of the matter is what you're \lied 
to," Pelt .. apIained, and the operaUoo is 
UlIeIy to be mare IIICceuful If people an-

derstand the program and its objectives, 
then are willinK to give it a try. 

Pettus, also the uom representative 
member of the Qtizens' Committee to Save 
Water, unveiled san Diego's dependence on 
the Colorado River aquadud. By contract, 
he said, the ci'Y should be receiving 10 per 
cent of the aqueduct's flow, while the 
remainder belongs to Los Angeles. In 
reality, San Diego Consumel 40 per cent of 
the supply since there is no other current 
water eupply available, but this additional 
30 per cent is only suppUed due to the stable 
situatioo of Los Angeles' reserves. The 
California Water Project, scheduled to 
provide southern California with a portion of 
its supply, presently deUvers exclusively to 
the drought stricken north, "un· 
derstandably," said Pettus. 

"Uniess we use 90 per cent or less of that 
which we used last year, we 'II be using more 
than is imported," stated Pettus. He said 
that the Colorado aqueduct is running at 110 
per cent capacity, meaning the use of a 
spare pump plus marginalleway are in the 
aqueduct. He added that II the area's 
demand increasel, the proportioo supplied 
to each penon dec .... acc:ordlnllY, til .. 

making further conservation imperative. 
"Nobody expects the drought to coritinue 

for several more years, so we won't run into 
serious problems," Pettus forecasted. 
Although San Diego reserves are not large, 
he said, the Colorado basin contains enough 
water to create a four year "cushion," 
which would keep the reservoirs filled. 
Additionally, he called the current drought 
conditlon "not absolute," meaning that the 
area is still receiving moderate rainfall to 
alleviate the situation. 

Pettus' crew, headed by Ralph S. Hensley, 
is working to reduce waste through 
reparation of faulty equipment, in addition 
to the more obvious meuures. Leaky 
faucets and malfunctions should be reported 
to the campus pllDDbing shop. Pettus felt 
relief that since the hot water outlets have 
been shut off, there are "only half as many 
faucets that can leak." 

Initially, there were members of the 
U~D staff who complained because they 
felt the absence of hot water with which to 
clean colfee cups and other utensils. Pettus 
said that he is not convinced that hot water 
helps in cleaning, adding that "you may 
have to scrub a little harder. I feel a lnt 

cleaner." Pettus explained that he felt open-
minded when approaching the project and 
discovering people's true needs. "I try to 
evaluate a situation like this on a firsthand 
basis." 

Oaancellor McElroy released a statement 
on energy and water conservation at UCSO, 
giving Pettus and his department support in 
reducing consumption. "I would like to ask 
that we all intensify our efforts to reduce the 
consumption of water, especially in 
laboratories," said McElroy. The statement 
cited the reduced now flush valves as 
reducing toilet use from 19 to 11 gallons per 
nush. Pettus added that this saves al)-
proximately 40 per cent of the water nor-
mally used, although two flushes would 
occasionally be required. 

The en!w of five workers who installed the 
flow f€duction devices began im-
plementation last June, although con-
swnption on the main campus last April and 
May WI\S 15 per cent less than that of last 
year. The university Is currenUy working in 
conjunction with the "Dripless Wednesday" 
program operated by the atizens' Com-
mittee to Save Water in order t" chieve the 
rP.duction goal.

Kids left waiting 
Day care center may be forced to close its doors to children 

by Alldy SebDeJder 
MlOCiate News Editor 

On July 1,1978 the time runs out 
for the UCSD Day Care Center. 
Unless new funding sources are 
located, the center caMot continue 
tooperate. 

The elq)eD5e of providing day 
care for the 50 children of parents 
who study or work on campus has 
steadily increased to a high thia 
year of $118,800. 

A state-mandated ratio of one 
staff member to every five 
children. as well as the campus 
conunitment to a quality learning 
environment keeps the monthly 
cost at $260 for each child. 

Parents pay , 150 for a full time 
child. The deficit in past years has 
been covered by registration fees, 
the Olancellor's discretionary 
fund, and United Way/Chad. 

Forced to choose between 
raising fees or cutting service, the 
Reg Fee committee had 
originally voted last April to 
eliminate the day care funding 
request from the budget. Campus 
protest resulted in i. recon-
sideration which would provide 
funds in a one time only allocation 
that would give the center a year to 
find alternative solutions. 

The Chancellor has been using 
discretionary foods to help bail out 
the center, but his office cannot 
continue to provide regular su~ 
port. Business Manager Laura 
Michetti, who oversees the 
operation of the center as a unit of 
the Business Office, responded that 
"Administrators are concerned 
about making a choice between 
educational priorities and such 
programs as day care in the 
context of limited discretionary 
funding." United Way Chad 
augmentation may also be 
questionable depending on the day 
care center's ability to meet the 
requirements for outside com-
munity agency status. 

Since the day care center 
recently moved from the Student 
Mfairs division to the financial 
management of the Business 
Office, a major effort has been 
initiated to insure its future on the 
San Diego campus. Maryann 
Herbenar, chair of a newly fonned 
Day care steering Committee, 
announced that a major survey 
will be conducted to identify

campus prionues. "Before solving 
the day care problem, it's crucial 
to assess the feelings and the needs 
of our students , faculty and staH," 
she stated. 

In addition, the Chancellor has 
provided resources for a team to 
visit each of the UC day care 
centers on other campuses. By 
mid -October a report will be made 
available for the campus and 
provided for UC President Saxon. 
It will describe the educational 
programs of the centers, staff 
arrangements, and funding ap-
proaches. 

Working with the Day Care 
Committee will be a group of 
faculty, staff, administrators, and 
students who will explore a full 
range of financial options for the 
center. Chaired by Laura 
Michetti, this options conunittee 
will develop a proposal for a new 
funding base on mode of operation. 

Day Care is expensive. 
Proponents and opponents of the 
service argue over who should be 
responsible for the service. Is it 
the parents alone, state in-
stitutions, the student community

understanding of this complex 
society, and a desire to be with my 
husband whose medical and social 
work gives him little time or wish 
to work in the United States. 

I have not been asking for a paid 
leave, but simply for a certain 
amount of flexibility in my 
relations with the University of 
California. This kind of flexibility 
has been completely absent at the 
administrative level. It appears as 
if the Department of Sociology 
(and the University of California 
system as a whole) is not 
responding to a tightening budget 
with any sort of creativity-but 
rather by tightening up the 
pressure to conform applied to 
younger faculty members and new 
entrants onto the job market. 

However, the leave issue is 
s imply a precipitating factor and 
not the basic reason for my 
resignation. If it were just a matter 
of being refused leave for a year, I 
would be willing to stay on and try 
to work things out. The fun-
damental fact is that the entire 
direction the Department and the 
University as a whole has been 
taking in the last few years is 
making it impossible to work here 
and retain any sense of self-respect 
or meaningful accomplishment. 

When I arrived on this campus in 
the fall of 1972 there was a sense of 
excitement in the participation of 
creative and growing programs. 
This was true at the department 
level with a number of new, en-
thusiastic faculty members in 
many fields and with a com-
mitment to building up com-
parative-historical studies as one 

of.our priority ....... Tbe .... 0(

procesa 0( the department was a 
crudaI aspect to tile degree 0( 
coUeliaUty and tilt exc...... 0( 
ide. among different perspectives 
that existed at that time. 

At the same time, my par-
ticipatioo in the ~ World 
Studies program of'lbird CoUege 
brought me into contact with a 
wider number of colleague. clolng 
significant and relevant work in 
many parts of the world. My IefIIe 
at that time was that Third College 
was a creative and positive 
response to the student turmoil of 
the 1964ls, that in spite of tensions 
and "growing pains" and even 
continuing clashes with the 
university administration it was 
still providing a significant 
educational experience to poor and 
minority students by giving 
necessary academic and technical 
training in the context ci an 
orientation to understanding and 
dealing with the social conflicts 
and problems of the world as a 
whole. It seemed at that time as if 
San Diego could be the basis for a 
relevaDt and progressive social 
science scholarship, in which In-
creasingly sophisticated research 
on macro-level problems of third 
world countries could be directly 
linked to the needs of third world 
and working class students in this 
country. 

Since then it has become clear 
that neither the Department of 
Sociology nor the University ad-

nUniltration as a wboJe is c0m-
mitted to this type of education. 
Rather, the Department of 
Sociology has seen a growing 
neglect of its comparatlve-
historical program and, more 
significantly, a systematic denial 
of tenure to many 0( tbe junioe 
faculty members wbo came in with 
me and in fact to almost all 0( tbose 
connected with Third College. 

The firing of Paul Wong in 1m, 
the denial of tenure to Bud Mehan 
and Will Wright in 1976 and to 
Reyes Ramos and AnlOOny Ngubo 
this year, and the unwarranted 
stalling in the tenure decision on 
Rae Blumberg's case are in-
dicative of the direction that is 
being taken. Teaching quality has 
evidently no relevance to such 
tenure decisions, and publications 
standards are being applied with 
increasing arbitrariness. The 
feeling is now prevalent among the 
junior members of the department 
that it is not enough to have simply 
books and articles published, but 
they must be books and articles 
published in "mainstream" 
sociology journals . and un-
derstandable by the criteria of 
mainstream sociology--that 
publications abroad or In 
peripheral or nonsociolOlitical fields 
or in journals oriented to radical or 
Marxist perspectives Will be 
disqualified; and that finally, even 
if one does have books and articles 
acceptable by mainstream 
sociological standards, the stan-
dards will not be applied if the

Christian Group ready 
with books and talk 

There was a rumor going about 
last year that God does not have 
tenure at UCSD. Whether it is true 
or not (and we don't propose to 
discuss the issue in depth), this 
type of rumor is an expression of 
the \Ulcertaioty many students feel 
here. The questions people ask 
about God aren't answered in 
many of our textbooks. Most ci the 
problems of everyday life such as 
loneliness, sex, depression: grades, 

roo~te hassles, jobs, stress and 
questIOns of self-worth aren't 
solved in our course books either. 

There ARE books that treat 
these topics though, and there are 
people to talk to at the Christian 

Booktable . We have a good 
selection of books, lots of free 
pamphlets, and we want to talk to 
you. We are willing to field any 
questions you have about (lIrist 
and Christians, and to listen to 
your troubles. We believe 
Christianity is more than outdated 
superstition or "blind" falth, and 
we want to share our reasons and 
our faith with you. 

The Booktable is run by mem-
bers of the Trident Christian 
Fellowship. You can find us on 
Revelle Plaza from eleven to one 
on weekdays. Come on by .

Campus media receives open 
letter to AS Vice-president 

We have received your memo of 
July 26, 1977 infonning us of 
"anomalies" in our constitution 
and "irregularities" in our 
registration. We checked with 
Joanne Ritchie, Student 
Organizations Advisor, and 
discovered that both our con-
stitution and our registration are in 
order. Your refusal to grant us 
funds is either arbitrary or 
discriminatory . 

We request equal consideration 
in the funding procedures as given 
to groups such as the Young 
Socialist Alliance, Women's 
Center , MECHA, Black Students 
Union and the American Civil 
Liberties Union. In the hope of 
cooperation and a desire to avoid 

unnecessary redress of grievances 
we request disbursement of funds 
properly applied for last Spring. 
We wish to remind the advisory 
Associated Students that 
budgetary regulations and 
procedures have focused on con-
troversy and struggle on this 
campus. 

These controversies have in-
cluded state and , federal 
authorities as well as student 
representatives and the ad-
ministration/management. We 
advise you to establish regulations 
and procedures which ensure due 
process and equal protection to all 
ASUCSDconstituents .

Charger story not accurate: 
Raiders make it doubly so 

I enjoyed and was amused by the 
article in the September 20 issue of 
the Triton Times regarding the San 
Diego Chargers' stay on campus 
this suuuner. Let's hope that the 
food and accommodations will be 
of some help to them during the 
current season. 

However, I want to correct one 
glaring inaccuracy in the article 
regarding the structural 
modifications and interior 
decorating which took place in the 
Cafeteria during the summer. The 
article states that the Warren 

Med students abroad seek admittance under act 

College Cafeteria was redecorated 
as a result of the Chargers' using 
the facility. The article goes on to 
state that the (lIargers chipped in 
some of the money. Both 
statements are totally inaccurate; 
and unfortunately, do not give 
credit to those who worked many 
months on this project. The 
Housing and Food Service Office 
on campus, as well as Warren 
College students and ad-
ministration were responsible for-
changing the cafeteria from a 
military messhaU to an attractive 
facility. A great deal of planning 
and hard work went into this 
project, and the College is 
dellghted with the final product. 
Working in the housing and food 
service area Is most often a 
thankless job; however, this time 
their efforts should be applauded 
and not misrepresented. 

I would like to express my 
feelings to )Iou concerning tbe new 
Federal legislation termed the 
Health Profelliou EdueatJoaal 
Assistance Act under the Depar-
tment of Health, Education, and 
Welfare. It regards U.S. citizens 
studying r'ledicine in foreign 
co\Ultries. l;.un such a student. 

I, like all of these students, was 
forced to stlldy medicine in a 
foreign couatry because, although 
qualified , I WAil denied admission 
into a U.S. medical school by the 
admission <:prrunittees on the 
principle <f limited enrollment. 

However, I, like many of these 
students, he.v, certain unremitting 
motives for studying medicine that 
,are beyond the consideration of 
medical school admission com-
mittees operating in the U.S.A. I, 
like many of these students, was so 
motivated that I learned a new 
language, tolerated arduous living 

conditions, and resolutely studied 
medicine under the less efficient 
educational facilities in a foreign 
country. Through years of per-
severence and hard work, I, like 
many of these students, proved my 
ability for medical study by 
passing the first part of the 
National medical licensing 
examination which qualifies one 
for clinical training in the United 
States. 

In the light of our proven ability 
and dedicalion, the Health 
Professions Educational 
Assistance Act requires that U.S. 
medical schools reserve positions 
in their clinical training class for 
the admission of students such as 
myself and provides funds for their 
training . This gives us ostracized 
students the happy prospect ci 
returning to tbe United States and 
completing the clinical phase of 
medical education in our own 
native language and in our own 

native country. After all, we are 
U.S. citizens and it Is our families' 
tax dollars that partly support the 
ultramodern medical schools in the 
U.s.A. while we labor under the 
primitive facilities in foreign 
medical schools. 

In addition, the Health 
Profeldo.. Edueatlo.al 
Assistance Ad Is also directed 
towards the benefit of the general 
public in that it provides for more 
primary health care through the 
education of more physicians. 

Nevertheless, several U.S. 
Medical schools, including the 
University of California at San 
Diego, are planning to resist this 
new legislation because they inIiat 
on holding absolute power over the 
choice ci medical students and 
their number. But their methods ci 
selecting medical studenis are far 
from perfect, and their limitation 
of enrollment Is far from falr with 
respect to those ostracized 
American students who 

desperately want to return to their 
homeland to complete their 
medical education. The only hope 
remaining Is that the public and 
the Federal Government can 
convince these obstinate medical 
schools that they should abide with 
the new law. In the end, these 
medical schools have only to gain a 
few deserving American studenta 
that are eminenUy dedicated to the 
study and profession of mediciDe.

Commentary 

EI Cortez Hotel is place to be on election night 
by Mark Stadler 

Notes from a night at Election 
Central: The Convention Center at 
the El Cortez Hotel is the place to 
be for area politicos, would« 
politicos and politico-watchers 
come election night. It doesn't 
matter if it's a REALLY BIG 
NIGHT (a la a presidential elec-
tion), a medium big n~ a la an 
off-year congressional election) or 
a really small night (a Ia last 
Tuesday's municipal primaries). A 
few hundred people, at the very 
least, alsways appear at the El 
Cortez to drink, smoke, cheer, cry, 
gawk and taIk-politics. 

Last Tuesday's election, by any 
standard, was dull. Aside from 
Prop D, the anti~ude bathing 
measure, there weren't any at-
tention grabbing races on the 
baUot. Just primary election for 
City Council, various school boards 
and City Attorney. 

No glamour there at all. If it 
hadn't been for Prop D, voter 
turnout would have disappeared 
from sight. 

Still, Election Centrall where the 
Registrar of Voters releases all the 
results as they are spewed out by 
the computer, where aU the media 
and most of the candidates gather 
to await said-results, was alive last 
Tuesday. The excitement wasn't 
anything like that generated last 

o en Letter 

November, during the Carter-Ford 
election, but it was clearly evident. 

Not that politics was the only 
dr,wing card at election central. 
No, making the scene at the EI 
Cortez seems to have become 
something of a social event. 
Election Central is a place for 
people to step out in their finery. 
Men and Women dreuecl in 'casual 
elegant - chic'congregate to talk, 
watch each other and keep an eye 
out for the minor celebrities <i San 
Diego politics. 

But politics remains the main 
drawing card. It brings the scores 
of high school journalists, with 
their notebooks and sharpened 
pencils, who-while honing their 
new skills-seek out good campaijln 
parties and free liquor. 

Politics also competes with 
fashion in adding color to the large 
Convention Center . Enthusiastic 
supporters of various candidates 
course through the room in waves 
marked by high~ld signs. They 
wear fake«raw hats, buttons and 
bumber stickers, and carry 
placards and banners, all in their 
candidate's special colors. 

The most enthusiastic sup-
porters were those for Evonne 
Schulze. When Schulze came to the 
Convention Center to claim victory 
in her pr~ race for the 
City Council's District Seven seat, 

she was preceded by a horde of 
supporters, waving signs for the 
television cameras and' .:hanting, 
"We want Evonne." 

A large amo\Ult of Schulze's 
support, at least as evidenced by 
her backers at the El Cortez, was 
comprised of young people . And 
she appeared to be the only can-
didate with much backing from the 
young, who mske up the strongest, 
most enthusiastic and available 
free support a candidate can 
receive . 

This year, young people seem to 
have scattered throughout the 
various candidates, once again 
dispelling the myth of political 
solidarity among American youth. 
Young people backed the liberal 
Schultz, but also supported arch-
conservatives like Mac Strobl and 
Fred Schnaubelt . 

Portraits of politicians: 
Gil Johnson, the City Coun-

cilman who represents UCSD and 
voted to close the campus Bike 
Shop, and in favor of construciton 
of North City West, the University 
Town Centre and the La Jolla 
Village Specialty Center, stood 
beaming in the glo.w of his land-
slide victory even before the first 
results were posted. 

And well he should have . 
Johnson , a 7l-year old who looks 
like a benevolent grandfather 

when he smiles, faced an amazing 
array of mediocrity in his 
primary election. So he spent the 
whole evening in the Convention 
Center, smiling like a grandfather 
and accepting congratulations. 

Julie Fisher, a frail looking 
woman with a steel spirit, rushed 
through the room, also smiling. 
The entire political establishment 
is against her " divisive" tactics on 
the city Board of Education. 
("Divisive," to the local power-
brokers, means not agreeing with 
the status quo. ) Still, she won a 
narrow victory in her primary 
race, and now faces a tough, but 
not impossible , battle in Novem-
ber. 

Yvorme Larson is the woman 
picked by area Republicans to face 
Fisher. Larson, a barbie doll 
turned elegant and middle-aged. 
parlayed endorsements for the SaD 
Diego Union and Mayor Wilson into 
a place in the November run-off 
against Fisher. And she could well 
beat Fisher, who, as the most 
controversial elected officer in San 
Diego , may lose in' the great wash 
of local desire for normalcy that 
killed nude bathing at Black's 
Beach. 

Rod Jones is a laughing sprite 
with a blonde beard and a sense of 
humor . He needed one, as he took 
only 30 percent in his quixotic 

Wo' 

• 

battle against incumbent City 
Attorney John Witt . 

Tim Cohelan, an attractive, 
young Irish Democrat cut in the 
Kennedy mold, landed in San 
Diego a few years ago after 
working for Sen. Cranston, and he 
hasn't stopped running yet. He 
finished third in the City Council's 
Seventh District, missing the 
nmoff by a few hundred votes. He 
picked the wrong city in which to 
start a political career. He should 
move to the Bay Area , or a selected 
Los Angeles district . 

Fred Schnaubelt, a realtor who 
took a surprising primary victory 
over incumbent Fifth District City 
Councilman Floyd Morrow, has 
been described by his fellow 
Republicans as being to the right of 
Attlla the Hun. Last Tuesday night, 
his campaign workers were on a 
quest for ink . "Come on, when 's he 
gOMa be back ?" One Schnaubel~ 
supporter asked for the fifth time 
about a reporter he wanted to 
interview the candidate. "Doesn 't 
he have a deadline?" 

When the persistent supporter 
discovered he was talking to a 
reporter from the UCSD 
newspaper, he said, "How 'bout 
you? You doin' interviews?A few 
nice spreads in the Triton Times 
would help us get our landslide ."

Three hundred and sixty of the 
$700 you'll pay to the Regents of the 
University of California this year

the Registration Fee. The Advisory 
Committee on Student Fee 
Programs (ACSFP), which is 
composed of seven students and. 
five administrators, Is advisory to 
the Vice Chancellor-Student 
Affairs on this $4 million budget 
designed to provide noMlcademic

they also advise the VCSA on the 
Campus Activity Fee (fiB/year) 
and the Student Center Fee 
(Pi/year), but the Associated

of taking over ad-

these fees, as they are student-

imposed on students by the

The opportunity for students to

concerted effort to lmpove the 
visibility of the ACSFP to the

are open, and students are urged to

resulting sense of powerlessness in 
the face of increasingly arbitrarily 
applied controls has completely 
poisoned the abnosphere in the

important to stress that it .exists 
not becuase of hostilities between 
any particular individuals but 
because of what is coming to seem 
like a purge.

the other hand, special admissions

The C&mpus Program Board bu 
begun this year with a new, and 
much improved, direction in Its 
film programming. Instead of the 
mostly medlocre caUbre films 
which were shown Jut year, thiI 
quarter the Board will be bringing 
campus five major motion pic-
tures, including the Academy 
Award winning Best Picture, 
Rocky. Also, the problem d. a poor 
facility, which has plagued Friday 
films in the past, has been 
alieviated. All the films will now 
be shown in Mandeville 
Auditorium, which is equipped 
with a screen and 35nun equip-
ment. 
The deelme.,\n the number of films 
will be offset by a six·film Bogart 

series In November, programming 
by student Ol'8aniutions, including 
aocbork OnuIIe this quarter, 
and the A S Free Film Series, 
which takes place every Monday 
Night in the Student Center, 
starting tonight with Uttle III 
Ma. 

The CPB Friday Night FIlms 
lead off thiI Friday; Sept. 30, with 
All tile PresldeDl'. Men, and 
conUnue with Rocky on Oct. 7, 'I1le 
Exorclst on Oct. 21, Network Nov. 
18, and The Maa WIlD SIded Don 
Everest (rescheduled from last 
year) .lin Dec. 2. Tickets are $1.25, 
available from the UCSD Box 
Office ; there will be two shows per 
night. 

In November, CPS will sponsor a 

Humphrey Bogart series, con-
sisting of six of his fiJol« and a live 
performance by Robert Sacchi 
entiUed "~eY'8 Back", a one 
man show in the tradition of "Give 
'Em Hell, Harry". The six films 
are CUablaaea, 'I1Ie Big Sleep, 
The Maltese Fal~, To Have ud 
Have Not, The CIiDe MutlDy, and 
The Africaa Queeo. The price for 
the entire series, including 
" Bogey's Back" is only $5.00 for 
UCSD students, $6.00 G .A. 

Anyone interested in becoming 
involved with the film program-

Writer 
Steve 
Martin 
emerges 
-as first-rate 
comedian 

Every year seems to produce a 
new, really hip, big~e comedian 
- people like George Carlin. Last 
year's entry was the venerable 
Richard Pryor. 

This year's runaway winner as 
top comedian would have to be that 
ramblin' guy, Steve Martin. 
Finally coming into his own as an 
onstage comedian, Martin has 
been seen on Saturday Night live 
and as a guest host on the Tonight 
Show. 

Martin has been a comedy writer 
for The Smothers Brothers 
Comedy Hour (for which he won an 
Enuny), Sonny and Cher, Pat 
Paulsen, Van Dyke and Company 
(for which he was nominated for an 
Emmy ), Ray Stevens, Glen 
Campbell and manerous others. 

Ask Steve what made him funny 
and he says, "Orange County _ 
Disneyland." Martin, who admits 
to having "done terrible things to 
my dog with a fork, rolled a jelly 
bean up an incline," and "sat on a 
lemon ~eringue pie," is actually a 
very senous person. 

Besides, tie has always made 
good money - five hundred dollars 
a week when he was only twenty-
one, writing for The Smothers 
Brothers, then a fifteen hWldred-a-
week j~b with The Glen Campbell 
Good-Tune Hour that he quit after 
two weeks, not because of cen-
sorship, but because he thought the 
show was dwnb. His stint with The 
Smothers Brothers led to the other 
television assignments but his 
lov.e . affair with te levisi~n comedy 
wrltmg drew quickly to an end. "I 
did a couple of summer shows and 
then I realized .. .I gotta get back to 
perfonning. " 

The essence of Martin's on-stage 
performance is captured in his new 
album, Let's Get Small. Recorded 
at the Boarding House in San 
Francisco, the LP contains most of 

the routines that have made 
Martin a type of cult hero. Among 
them are his " Ramblin ' Man " 
"Let's Get Small" and "Exc~e 
Me " routines. 

"I was in a restaurant when the 
guy I was with said, 'Hey , do you 
mind if I smoke?' I said, 'No, do 
you mind if lfart? " His fascination 
with smoking includes the 
following excerpt from his book 
"Cruel Shoes " called The 
Smokers : "He lit the cigarette and 
smoked it down to the filter in one' 
breath. He silently thanked the 
cigarette company for being 
thoughtful enough about his health 
to include a filter to protect him. So 
he lit up another. This time he 
didn't exhale the squeaky-clean 
filtered smoke, but just let it nestle 
in his lungs, filling his body with 
that good menthol navor. Saine 
more smokers knocked on his door 
and they came in and all started 
smokin~ along with him. 

'How wonderful it is that we 're 
all smoking ,' he thought. 

Everyone smOked dud smoked 
and after they all talked about 
smoking and how nice it was that 
they were all smokers and then 
they smoke some more ... 

What can you expect from a 
ramblin' guy with an arrow 
through his head ?

Star Trek heroes rake 
in bucks on circuit 

By steve Lemke. 

(CPS)-Notbing is more down to 
earth than taking a popular subject 
and exploiting it to its limits. With 
the ever.mcreasing popularity ri 
Star Trek, space ezploration and 
science-fiction literature, the 
potential for buck-gathering is 
reaching new hei~ts. 

. 

While US and Russian military 
scientists work on feasible laser 
weaponry, while a professor from 
Princetoo espouses em the ad-
vantages ri space colonization and 
while everyeme is still wondering 
whether there is life em Man, 
former Star Trek actors rake in the 
money on the lecture circuit. 

No one is denying the en-
thlWiaatic feelinp people are 
extending to a televiaiem aeries that 
has been rif the·airwaves for eight 
years. No eme is denying the In-
creasing market and demand for 
more science fiction Uterature. 
And no one is denying W'llliam 
Shatner, ~ Nimoy, and 
Gene Roddenberry speaking fees 
of up to $3000. 

Intertwining his talk about the 
future of man's ezploration rl 
space with poetry and science 
fiction excerpts, Sbatner recently 
received $8000 for two presen-
tations at a college In Boulder, 
Colorado. Some of the more ardent 
fans of the series, which bas grown 
to cult proportions, were angry at 
the 'intellectual presentation. ' 

Leonard Nimoy, the pollty-
earred half-Vulcan, Mr. Spack, got 
$2500 for describing himself not as 
Spack but as an incurable 
romantic. Speaking before a 
packed house at the University of 
Arkansas, Nimoy tried to bring the 
cimcepts of the Star Trek show into 
perspective with what humans find 
missing in their lives: life, truth, 
goodness. hlDTl8nity. 

While these two and others ri the 
crew of the starship Enterprise are 
just recently capitalizing on the 
bursts of craziness affiliated with 
fans, the creator and producer of 
the series, Gene Roddenberry has 
been accepting engagements since 
the show was cancelled in 1968. 
Quorently involved with putting 
together a much demanded Star 
Trek movie, it is estimated thatfor 
$2000 an audience can hear his 
views on the show, its potential and 
impact. 

Trekkies who find that their 
thirst for their heroes is not 
satiated by mere speeches and film 
clips will find entrepreneurs eager 
to fill the gap. At the Federation 
Trading Post - East in New York 
aty, the owner will sell you 
anything frem photos of the crew to 
little furry tribbles. Comic, 

science~ction and strict Star Trek 
conventions will further help 
quench any desires. But some 
people never Ret enough. 

<Ale college paper in Missouri 
devoted a feature story to a self-
proclaimed "rabid Trekkie." Her 
room bulging with Star Trek 
paraphernalia, the CCH!d described 
the show as the "first intelligent 

science~ction on television, ex-
panding the mind." 

EKpanding the mind is the thrust 
of those speaking about the 
populartty of Star Trek and 
Beyond. At a recent sclence-flction 
convention in Denver, one par-
ticipating member said "For most, 
the fad is a springboard into more 
serious sci.fi reading ... although 
some don't go past that stage." 

Whether or not earthlings take 
off and begin full-6Cale exploration 
on their own, they will always have 
the following words to live by : 
"Live lemg and prosper." Fans and 
'the . crew' are taking the phrase 
seriously.

Controversial admissions changes

Salerno made the suggestion, he said, 
because the Board's decision on the BOARS 
proposal will be tbe most important decision It 
will make in the 19705, and so should be made 
without undue haste. He also wants to hold any 
decision until the US Supreme Court rules in 
the Bakke decision, a ruling which may have a 
drastic effect on minority enrollments in UC. 

Several Regents supporting Salerno 
questioned the usual procedure, under which 
Saxon presents the arguments for both sides of 
an issue, saying they wanted to hear aU 
arguments, including any Saxon might have 
rejected as unimportant. 

Those opposing tbe student Regent 's motion 
said they saw no reason to set aside the 
traditional methods by wbich the Regents 
consider an Issue. 

John Galbraith, representing the UC 
Academic Senate, which approved the BOARS 
proposal, said the changes proposed by BOARS 
"are very modest, very sli~." 

In answer to Galbraith, Regent Stanley 
Scheinbaum said the BOARS proposal Is "not a 
narrow issue, even if only a few actual ap-
plicants are affected. The proposal will have a 
great impact on all minorities who had thought 
to enter UC, and decided against it because of 
the emphaSis on test scores."

Orientation over: 
Midterms next week 

The calm before the stonn. 
Welcome Week at UCSD was, for 

many, a chance to become familiar 
with the campus before the rush of 
classes and first day's an-
nuuncement of mid-tenns. 

A new roonunate, your dor-
mitory , cafeteria food . F~eedom 
for the first time. Savormg the 
smell of independence. 

For the veteran student, there 
was the move to an apartment, or 
the search for that perfect house in 
Del Mar. The house with the lowest 
rent, that is . 

It was a time to reflect on that 
summer job - washing dishes or 
serving fast food . Or maybe to drop 
a line to those special people you 
met while traveling across the 
country by car . 

Memories of your family. A new 
appreciation of your parents , or 
the quarrel that told you it was 
time to be on your own. 

Perhaps none of that was in the 
cards. Perhaps you were a certain 
editor who devoted the summer to 
producing a dazzling Orientation 
Issue with which to greet returning 
students . 

In any case, each coUege had its 
own events plaMed to help fresh-
men get to know the University and 
where to get help when they need 
it. Orientation leaders led groups

of newcomers through the maze of 
campus services. Groups met to 
discuss the prospects for four 
years of concentrated learning. 

The week did not pass without 
fun. In fact, this year's frestunen 
appeared to be concentrating on 
the party side of life much more 
than those of previous years. 
Stereos blared from Argo Hall and 
parties were generated all over the 
campus. Rookies and veterans 
alike enjoyed free food at Revelle, 
an ice cream social, dances and 
impromptu games at Muir field. 

Now that all of that is out of your 
system ... 

Time to hit the books. Good luck.

If New Mexico's Enviromnental 
Improvement Agency (EIA) 
agrees, the company nat will pour 
a solution « water and sulfuric 
acid into the rubble heap. Tbe acid 
will leach copper from the rock, 
filtering it into a pipe beneath the 
blasted area. The mineral and acid 
solution - called leachate - will be 
pumped to the surface tbrougb the 
pipe.

worlds In the DlinInI buIinea," 
expIalns industrial bydrololi.fDr. 
WillIam M. Turner, ''it'sleacbing. 
The economic advantages are very • 
attractive." Leach mining, Turner 
says, eliminates the need for mine 
shafts, wute dumpa, smelts, 
tailings diIpoaal, excavation and 
mucblabor. 

Oxymin's planned leacbing 
operation, notes Deidre Hazelrigg, 

Preai~nt of the ce, would cover 40 
to 60 acres and go 250 feet deep. 
That, she says, would require the 
' 'largest non-nuclear explosion In 
history" to fragment the rock. 

Beca\lle of the low capital and 
labor costs, Cbymin reportedly 
will require no more than 7A) em-
pioyees to extract 18 to .. « copper 
a day from ita plamed mining 
operaUon here. 

Solftat tile Problem 
If the Indiana and concerned 

residents of Cerrillos have their 
"ay, bowever, Olrymin's pilot 
mine will neftr become operative. 
Despite the long history of mining 
bere, the populace Is alDlost 
lm8J1imoualy opposed to the copper 
leacbinl project. 

"We're not against mining 
copper," 11)'8 Hugh Huelrigg of 
the Concerned OUzena of Cerrillos 
(CCC), "but we are against 
anybody experimenting with our 
water table. " 

Residents are worried that 
leachate will seep through the 
Inken rock into the town's wells. 
"The area Is so fractured that the 
acid could go aU kinds of ways," 
charges Hobart Durham, a 
chemist in Santa Fe, about 30 miles 
north of ~rrillos. "Sulfuric acid is 
a very good solvent. It dissolves 
lots of things •• skin and 
everything . " 

Durham also is concerned that 
the blasting of the copper deposit 
C9uld damage the enUre Santa Fe 
"ater basin, whose northern edge 
lies beneath Cerrillos. 

Oxymin President Paul A. Bailly 
has acknowledged that its plana 
include blastib8 on a scale 10 times 
larger than the OIIe-million cubic 
footexplosionlaat January. 

Although hesitant to discuss 
specifics, Oxymin officials argue 
that similar leach mining 
techniques already have been 
employed succesafully for the 
commercial mining of uranhun In 
Teus, potash In Utah and sulfur in 
Louisana and Utah. The process, 
they IIY, was first developed some 
50 years ago for the salt mining 
business. 

While the CCC concertrates its 
opposition on the effect of the 
quality of the area's water, local 
Indian tribes are object~ to the 
quantity of water copper leaching 
will require. 

" If Oxymin \lIeS 500-acrelfeet of 
water each year (as Is planned) , 
there wiD not be enough water for 
farming," charges Ernest Lovato, 
executive director of tribal affairs 
for the Santo Domingo pueblo. 

Lovato points out that ''there has 
been a heavy Indian population 

-here for many thousands 01. years.

Uast year, the Santo Domingo 
pueblo joined the citizens of 
CerriUos in demanding that the 
state monitor and col&rol lbe 
0J:ymin project. At their urging, 
Gov. Jerry Apodaca appoln~ a 
task force of state officials to study 
the leach mining plana. Apodaca 
declared that 0J:ymln abould no& 
begin its operatiOlll unW all 
questions rePrdinl the project's 
safety were answered. 

The task force aUowed the test . 
bIaat to take place lut January, 
arguing that "several technical 
questions can't be answered 
without it. " 

SInce then, both Oxymln and Its 
opponents bave been waiting for 
the state Environmental 
Improvement Agency, in con-
junction with the task force, to 
make a final decision about 
whether the company can begin 
satlU"ating the fractured rock with 
water and acid. 

With ElA's decision expected 
JOOIl, the IndiID opponenta of leach 
mining already are preparing their 
strategy in case lbey loee. 

"We are sovereign, we bave 
every reason to ask Congress and 
Interior to ~tect our rights," 
says lAwato. "And, if the U.S. 
govenunent can't be concerned, I 
think it's time for us Indians to ask 
for foreign aid."

Mental Patients Drugged Out 
by SUian stera 

Pacific New. Service 

When 30-year-old Bay Area 
carpenter Donald Stein refused to 
take his medications at Califor-
nia 's state mental hospital at 
Napa, a team of ~ychiatric 
technicians followed him to his 
bed, cornered him and forcibly 
injected him with a needle. 

Despite evidence that 

lawsuits chaUenging the right of 
psychiatry and the state to violate 
the civil rights of persons labeled 
" insane. " 

Meanwhile, California mental 
patients' rights groups are t~.ing 
their case to state health offiCials 
and legislators and running into 
solid opposition. 

After Network Against 
Psychiatric Msault (NAPA), a 
San Franclsco-based patients' 
rights group, sat in at California 
Gov. Jerry Brown's office for one 
month last sununer, state hospitals 
director Miller conceded, " I think 
we use drugs too much." 

an investigation into the use of 
drugs in state hospitals , but state 
health director Dr Jerome Lackner 
sa ys he r emains opposed to 
NAPA's demand fo r an end to 
forced drugging. " I just den't think 
all patients are capable of deciding 
for themselves," Lackner says.

psychoactive drugs cause brain 
damage in a significant nwnber of 
users, the nurses at Napa, where 
Stein was fonnerly a paUent, 
round up the patients and pass out 
the drugs four times a day. Those 
like stein who refuse to take them 
are then forced to. 

Since then a· State Assembly 
research committee has launched 

Another patient's rights group, 
the Committee Against Forced 
Treatment , has been unsuccessful 
in enlisting a legislative sponsor 
for its right-to-refuse-medications 
proposals . And the psychiatric 
establistunent, organized health 
workers and the p~nnaceuticals 
lobby have already indicated 
opposition to any legis lation 
granting patients the absolute 
right to refuse drugs. - - - - - - - - ctJU/',,/J - - - - - - - - - - - - --

Mental patients' rights groups 
across the country call that 
"chemical rape"; mental health 
authorities caU it chemotherapy. 
Both agree that psychoactive 
drugs have become the standard 
treatment for more than six 
million Americans now involved in 
the mental health system. In 
California, for example, 90 percent 
of state mental hospital patients 
are on drugs, according to state 
hospitals director Don Z. Miller. 

California recently joined a 
handful of states with laws 
restricting involuntrary treatment 
by electroshock and lobotomy -
but no state aUows involuntarily 
committed patients the right to 
refuse psychoactive drugs . 

Donald Stein is going to cowt to 
try to change that. This fall , the 
case of Stein VI. Uno joins another 
in Massachusetts as the first

whole the various Black Studies, 
Oticano Studies, Third World 
Studies and Wcmen's Studies

then, that many students should 
conclude that American univer-

country's power structure, that 
such things as holding investments 
in the racist regime of South Africa 
are not simply accidental but 
related to the controls applied 
here? Is it any wonder that they 
should decide that only the

I have had many good ex-

leave these . For me, at present, 
there are more important 
priorities. Hopefully, those

Researcher sm, "It's easy" Eskimos._ 

Family roots explored in class [CooUDued from page Zj "Our total community-spirit, 
economy, legends, bopes-revolve 
around the whale," Edwardsen 
says. "Our rigbt to hunt the 
boWhead is older than government. 
Nobody in his right mind would 
deny a culture its livelihood. 
Human rigla are more important 
than international conventions." 

Tracing your family roots is 
neither espelllive nor too difficult 
if you know the tecmiques, said 
genealogical researcher Eunice 
Koooid. 

Mucb of the work can be done by 

family trees, she adds. 
People want to know who they 

are, said Konold. "They want to 
find out sbout the people who 
contributed to making them what 
they are today." 

Too many people who are inspired 
to trace th~ir family trees get 
stopped at the great-grandfat~er level. 

mail correspondence from borne, 
and the only real expense would 
come from travel to the home of 
one's ancestors, she said. 

The ease in tracing one's roots is 
one of the reasons many senior 
citizens are actively involved in 
genealogical research, Konold 
noted. And, of course, since the. 
movie "Roots" was shown on TV, 
people aU over the country are 

becomin~ more interested in 

With more than 25 years of 
genealogical research as well as 
membership in a nwnber of 
genealogical and historical 
societies, Konold knows the most 
effective and intelligent way to 
trace one's family tree. 

She'll share this infonnation this 
fall in a UC San Diego Extension 
course titled "Delving into Your 
Origins," scheduled for 7"10 p.m.

Too many people wbo are now 
inspired to trace their family trees 
get stopped at the great grand-
parent or great-great grandparent 
level, Konold noted. "Most people 
begin by checking with their living 
relatives and can get back to great-
great grandparents witbo~ any 
problem. But, when no one can teU 
them what infonnation is beyond 
that, they need to know how to do 
original research." 

Konold's UCSD Extension course 
will focus on the methods of 
research, sources, Dlodern 
microfilming techniques, oral 
history and photography. 

" A lot of correspondence can be 
done from your own borne," she 
said. "In fact, I did research for 20 
years before I even took a trip." 

She does note that there comes a 
time when the researcher wants to 
actually visit the home town of a 
relative, " Perhaps to see the 
cemetary or look into county 
records that hadn't been 
microfilmed. " 

For the most part, though, 
persons tracing their pasts can 
utilize the local libraries, 
correspond with the Genealogical 
Society Library in Salt Lake City, 
Utah (which contains records from 
all 50 states and nearly 100 foreign 
countries), and research 
g~nealogical periodicals. 

Adr~~~tal~ct 
Statehlent on the issue of whether 
or not the U.S. should object to the 
IWC ban has been prepared by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service. 
It notes that whale meat, or 
Dluktull, has always been an 
essential source of protein and 
vitamins for Eskimos, most of 
whom stiD live on a subsistence 
level. 

It also takes account of the 
central role the bowhead plays in 
Eskimo religious ceremonies and 
social structure . Participation in 
the whale hunt, for example-which 
is still conducted in the traditional 
manner with smaU skin boats and 
19th century-type harpoons-is 
considered an important act of 
coming4-age for young males. 

yet if the U.s. objects to the IWC 
ban and thus maintains the status 
quo for the Eskimos, serious in-
ternational iJnplications would 
result. Marion Edie, testifying for 
the Council on Envirorunental 
Quality, reminded the Conunerce 
Department that "since 1972, when 
U.S. representatives to the IWC put 
forward a proposal for a 10-year 
moratorium on aU whaling, the 
world quota has been cut by !iO 
percent. U.S. leadership in this 
effort has been essential ." 

For infonnation on enrollment in "Other nations," Edie continued, 
Konold's course, call UCSD "such as Japan and the Soviet 
Extension at 452-3400, or register at Union, have accepted quotas 
the first c~ session. costing them billions of dollars.

The U.S. is now being asked to 
make its first sacrifice. Our 
response to this hardship is a 
serious test of our tommitment. 

Edie emphasized that any long-
term solution must involve native 
planning and that while the 
moratorium lasts, the U.S. should 
provide work for native hunters in 
muclHleeded whale researcb. 
"The damage 0.£ a ban on the 
bowhead to this native culture 
would be only temporary," she 
concluded. "The political damage 
of filing an objection might well be 
permanent. " 

Thomas Garrett, U.S. Deputy 
Commissioner to the IWC, 
predicted that ''the result of filing 
an objection will be the lodging of 
another objection by Russia and 
Japan to extend the hunting of 
sperm whales. The ultiJnate cost of 
this objection would be the 
destruciton of the great whales." 

William Aron , U.S. Com-
missioner to the IWC and director 
of the Commerce Department's 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), urged 
Eskimo whalers to accept the 
moratorium and suggested that the 
ban could be lifted next year when 
the Iwe meets in London. Plans 
could then be devised for native 
self-regulation and a quota system. 

As the Commerce Department 
wrestles with the decision. the 
National Marine Fisheries Service 
is considering a change in 
designation of the bowhead-froDl 
"endangered" to "depleted" under 
the Marine Mamma1 Protection 
Act. 

That change could result in a 
total ban on bowhead hunting-
regardless of, or in addition to, the 
IWC moratoriwn . Despite EskiJno 
protests and threatened lawsuits, 
this could well be the last season 
for bowhead whalers.
