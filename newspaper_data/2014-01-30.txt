VOLUME 47, ISSUE 28  THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 2014 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

University of California offi-
cials recently announced several 
new initiatives to further devel-
op online education for the UC 
system through the Innovative 
Learning Technology Initiative, an 
online education program launched 
in early 2013 under former UC 
President Mark G. Yudof. 

The initiatives were discussed 
during the last UC Board of Regents 
meeting held last Wednesday on Jan. 
15 in San Francisco at the Mission 
Bay campus with the presence of the 
University of California, California 
State University and California 
Community College systems.

Some of the initiatives include 
the establishment of a cross-campus 
enrollment webpage, funding for 
an additional 30 courses to be cre-
ated and the development of an 
approval process for cross-campus 
course credit.

The establishment of ILTI was 

made possible with the $10 mil-
lion grants that Gov. Jerry Brown 
allotted to the UC and to the CSU 
systems in July 2013. It was intended 
to offer more undergraduate courses 
online with an emphasis on high-
in-demand and prerequisite classes.

An older program, UC Online, 
was launched in January 2012 after 
a two-year pilot program. It now 
offers 11 courses for cross-campus 
enrollment during Winter Quarter 
and Spring Semester 2014. 

However, not all of the UC 
campuses are participating in this 
endeavor. UCSD and UC Santa 
Barbara have decided not to partake 
in the program until the complica-
tion of processing student enroll-
ment is resolved.

As a strong advocate for online 
education, Brown believes in its 
ability to offer students affordable 
and accessible courses for credit 
through technological means. 
Nevertheless, some UC officials are 
wary of the issues that online course 
programs pose. 

UC provost Aimee Dorr pre-
pared a presentation during the 
meeting to show that students 
were generally “less happy and less 
engaged” in online class environ-
ments lacking human interaction.

New Commuter Initiatives Arrive on Campus

UC Regents Announce 
Online Course Expansion

UC  SYSTEM

The new programs 
include cross-campus 
online enrollment and 
course credit approval.

Lead investigator Bradley 
S. Moore, Ph.D., of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography and the 
UCSD Skaggs School of Pharmacy 
and Pharmaceutical Sciences, first 
author Kazuya Yamanaka and a team 
of researchers developed a “plug and 
play” method to jumpstart unknown 
biological processes and identify 

potential drugs. The study was pub-
lished Jan. 20 in the Proceedings of 
the Natural Academy of Sciences.

“All organisms have genomes, 
all chemicals produced by cells are 
genome encoded, and many drugs we 
use are small molecules from nature,” 
Moore said. “We take advantage of 
nature’s chemistry in the human ther-
apeutic context.”

UCSD Transportation and Parking Services is implement-
ing various changes, including a bus advertising program and 
new parking technology, to help reduce department costs and 
improve overall reliability. 

The auxiliary department has seen its revenues decrease 
in previous years, an issue that is worsened by the increasing 
costs of maintaining the various transit and shuttle services 
around UCSD. According to TPS, this has led the department 
to explore new ways of increasing funding while lowering its 

expenses. One such idea was putting advertisement wraps on 
campus buses. Many are already making their rounds with 
UCSD Health System displays.

Robert Holden, director of Auxiliary Business Services, is 
in charge of managing the transportation department.

“We have been reaching out to everyone — students, fac-
ulty, staff, patients, visitors, bike riders, bus riders and more,” 
Holden said in a Jan. 23 UCSD News Center press release. “We 
want to ensure that the needs of all members of the campus

community are met.”
According to the press release, 

revenue from the advertisements 
is paying for one of four new buses 
that began operating last quarter. 
They are expected to offer univer-
sal, cost-efficient services for the 
student body until the Light Rail 
Transit system is implemented on 
campus in 2018. 

Holden also laid out future plans 
to use parking space availability dis-
plays and license plate recognition 
technology at UCSD beginning in 
Fall Quarter 2014. 

First, sensors will be placed in 
each parking spot at the Gilman 
Parking Structure. 

The information will relay to 
electronic signs outside the build-
ing, which will display the availabil-
ity of parking spaces inside. 

Furthermore, license plate rec-
ognition will be tested as a pos-
sible replacement for printed park-
ing permits as well. According to 
the press release, Transportation 

Services staff will be equipped with 
various sensors that allow them to 
scan license plates instead of check-
ing for permits. 

 Up to five license plates can be 
associated with a single student, 
useful for those who use multiple 
cars when necessary. Once testing is 
complete, the program is expected 
to save as much as $60,000 annually 
in printing costs.

“In both cases, Transportation 
Services will be leveraging tech-
nology to operate in a more cost-
effective manner as well as improv-
ing traffic management systems and 
operational efficiency,” Holden said 
in an email to the Guardian. 

Other changes include the intro-
duction of redesigned Occasional 
Use Permits that allow students 
to scratch off only the days they 
park on campus and the increased 
support of ADA Transport, which 
provides rides for disabled stu-
dents, and Alternative Transport 
Programs, which gives subsidies to 
Zimride, vanpools and other ser-

vices. 
“We are working extremely hard 

to find new ways to reduce our costs, 
increase efficiency and improve our 
services,” Holden said. “Through 
outreach to the campus community 
over the last year, we’ve received 
some great feedback from our cus-
tomers, such as the bus advertising 
idea. We continue to explore every 
avenue to find the best possible 
path to financial viability.”

While Transportation Services 
makes these improvements, A.S. 
Council will also be holding a cam-
puswide referendum during Week 
8, which would add a $52 quarterly 
student fee to cover transportation 
costs if it passed. 

Seventy-one percent of 
the fee would go directly to 
Transportation Services and a 
Student Transportation Advisory 
Committee, while the rest would 
help cover financial aid.

As a proof of the “plug and play” 
concept, they utilized the process to 
create a new antibiotic, called taro-
mycin A. The antibiotic is effective 
against MRSA, an antibiotic-resis-
tant bacterium. After sequenc-
ing the genome of the bacterium, 
Saccharomonospora sp CNQ490, 
they found 19 clusters of genes used 
in synthesizing molecules. One clus-
ter resembled the sequence of genes 
used to make daptomycin, which is 
an antibiotic regularly used.

“Once we have the genes encod-
ing it in a vector, we are in full control 
over the capacity of the new chemical 
entity,” Moore said. 

Then, scientists transferred the 
gene cluster into a certain species of 
yeast, which used the genes to make 
an antibiotic. According to Moore 
and his team, an advantage of using 

marine microbes is that the ocean 
covers 70 percent of the earth’s sur-
face and is a rich source of microbial 
diversity available for discovery of 
new drugs for treating cancer, infec-
tions and other medical conditions.

“It is just more difficult for 
researchers to access the deep ocean, 
so more of the land-based organisms 
have already been discovered,” Moore 
said. “But the ocean has an untapped 
microbial resource, and the microbial 
populations are different there, which 
allows for new potential to get greater 
chemical diversity.”

Although the technique is proven 
to work for marine microbes, the 
“plug and play” method can work 
with any DNA — whether from the 
ocean or from the land. This makes it 
advantageous for future research and 
drug synthesis.

“In my opinion, the new synthetic 

biology technology we developed — 
which resulted in the discovery of a 
new antibiotic from a marine bacte-
rium — is just the tip of the iceberg 
in terms of our ability to modernize 
the natural product drug discovery 
platform,” Moore said to UCSD News 
on Jan. 22.

The method can begin to create 
new natural chemicals or derivatives 
that can be utilized to address some 
of the resistant microbes developing 
in hospitals and community centers. 

“We can then develop this into 
a technology that can be easy to 
use, fast and efficient — we are able 
to rapidly make large libraries of 
chemicals for screening purposes of 
antibiotic activity or other human 
diseases,” Moore said.

Regardless, Brown continues to urge 
for a complete absence of human 
interaction in online courses.

“You say you need human 
touch — I say, maybe you don’t 
need it,” Brown told the The Daily 
Californian on Jan. 28. “The bar-

rier here is the human software, the 
human thought that we’re putting 
into the technology.”

Amidst the skepticism shared by 
some UC professors, the expansion 
of online education is still under-
way, beginning with ITLI. UC offi-
cials and Academic Senate leaders 
have been meeting frequently since 

September to propel this project 
forward. They intend to create 150 
credit-bearing courses by 2016, 
offering online and hybrid courses 
that infuse the traditional environ-
ment of classes with online courses.

STUDENT EVENTS

Weekly events and opportunities just for students.

“I’ve been here every week this 
quarter, so I don’t need to introduce 
myself,” said —  guess who — Kyle 
Heiskala. 

Last night, Heiskala did not come 
with SOVAC or ASUCSD Moves; he 
came to council to introduce incoming 
Director of Public Affairs for University 
Communications and Public Affairs 
Denise Serrano.

Next, mem-
bers of the Union 
of Jewish Students, 
including the 
Guardian’s own 
Zev Hurwitz, invited councilmem-
bers to their Community Shabbat this 
Friday night.

“We didn’t request A.S. funding 
for this one, so yeah, you guys aren’t 
paying for this,” Hurwitz said. “Take 
that as you will.”

CALPIRG Campus Organizer Alex 
Acuna announced that CALPIRG’s 
quarterly pledge drive will be hap-
pening next week, meaning that many 
students will soon be wondering where 
the $10 deduction in their TritonLink 
Account Activity came from. 

Steven Partida was announced as 
the new Multicultural Greek Council 
Representative; then, VP Finance Sean 
O’Neal presented on behalf of the 
Vagina Monologues. He announced 
that this year, Vagina Monologues want 
to celebrate mens’ opinions of vaginas 
and will give free donuts and coffee to 
men who agree to talk lightheartedly 
about vaginas in a short video. 

A.S. President Andy Buselt 
announced that the transportation ref-
erendum may be moved to the general 
election, rather than being voted on 
during the special election, due to lan-
guage amendments.

Tensions finally mounted when 
Marshall Senator Kathleen Maguire 
explained why Marshall College 
Council had not passed A.S. Council’s 

revised bylaws. Sixth College also 
declined to pass the constitution, but 
this week, Marshall took all the heat.

Marshall seemed pessimistic about 
the constitution and negative about the 
process as a whole. 

Student Council of ERC tabled vot-
ing to pass the constitution until next 
week, so President Andy Buselt wrote a 

document to move 
the filing period 
for new candidates 
from Week 5 to 
Week 6 of Winter 
Quarter, allowing 

time for ERC to pass the constitution.
After recent racist hate crimes on 

their campus, black student activists at 
San Jose State University sent a resolu-
tion for UC student governments to 
pass in solidarity with the school’s anti-
racist agenda. A clause in the resolu-
tion stating that UCSD was inherently 
responsible for these crimes (based on 
our not-so-clean history when it comes 
to race relations) led to a meandering, 
drawn-out discussion, amending and 
un-amending and multiple votes.

The quote of the night came from 
Sean O’Neal:

“I think it’s really sad that it’s illegal 
to be nude on campus,” O’Neal said. 
“I think it’s a really good form of self 
expression, and I really encourage all 
of you to engage in it.”

What, Sean, is the undie run not 
good enough for you?

Finally, the meeting spiraled into 
a friendly Super Bowl debate, which 
only ended with an interjection from 
Revelle Senator Soren Nelson.

“Just a shout-out to those of us 
who don’t give a fuck,” Nelson said. 
“Go, Team America!”

Someone else said, “Go, halftime!” 
To all this, I say, “Go, commer-

cials!”
Have a happy Super Bowl Sunday, 

everyone. I’ll be back next week.

UCSD students are well trained to know that when a Construction Alert 
email is sent out, they should press 
“delete,” but they should look out 
for a possible construction email 
about a new biology building that 
has been 10 years in the making. 

While the public has not yet 
been informed about whether 
the building will be an administra-
tive or classroom space — or, really, 
whether it’s sure to happen at all 
— the plan raises many concerns 
about how best to address a long-
running growth spurt at an under-
funded university.

The rumored building would 
be placed on the grassy quad that 
sits kitty-corner to Urey Hall and 
Pacific Hall in the already crowded 
Revelle College. Complaints that 
the building will block out one 
of Revelle’s only quads may seem 
petty, but there’s still an argument 
for keeping grassy spaces around, 
even if only for casual traversing. 
Working for a school with a perva-
sive anti-social reputation, UCSD 
planners should consider the reper-
cussions of turning Revelle into an 
even more densely packed series of 
cement blocks.

Ultimately, the biology building 
might be necessary to accommo-

date the growing amount of biology 
majors on campus. According to 
the UCSD registrar almost 5,000 
students were enrolled in biol-
ogy majors this year, and scrolling 
through UCSD’s Winter Quarter 
2014 biology course schedule, even 
in Week 4, shows an endless blur of 
red “Full” alerts. 

There is a possibility that some 
class spaces are not being utilized 
effectively and to their maximum 
capacity, but the infamous 700-stu-
dent Genetics class in Peterson 108 
and 110, in which half the students 
watch their professor on a screen 
in the adjacent room, suggests that 
this is not the case. 

UCSD made strides in May 2013 
when it completed construction on 
Galbraith Hall, its biggest lecture 
hall yet. However, the capacity to 
which Galbraith Hall is already 
being used indicates that demand 
for desks is far from being met. In a 
May 30, 2013 article, the Guardian 
reported that the two-story lecture 
hall, which opened for classes dur-
ing Summer Session I of 2013, was 
equipped to seat 417 students and 
was intended to be used 45 hours 
per week. Despite this extra lecture 
venue, however, classes are still 
packed to the brim.

While using classrooms to their 

maximum capacity seems ideal, 
students’ schedules are also a seri-
ous concern. Every year, it seems 
like more classes are offered in 
three-hour periods, sometimes 
starting at 5 p.m. or 7 p.m. 

There are obvious consequences 
to holding a three-hour class that 
touches at a time more suited for 
dinner or sleep, but to make things 
worse, the quarter system means 
these classes meet just 10 times 
before Finals Week. If a student 
misses two classes, he or she risks 
losing out on nearly a quarter of 
the course material. And finally, the 
opportunity for students to social-
ize in the evenings — whether 
through organization meetings, 
college activities or sports — is sur-
rendered to fit lecture halls’ fleeting 
availability. 

At a school where students’ 
schedules are dictated by lecture 
hall capacity, it’s quite clear that 
resources should be funneled to 
reversing this backward relation-
ship. So if the rumors of this biol-
ogy building turn out to be true, 
we hope that UCSD administration 
makes it a lecture hall — or a few 
years from now, students might be 
seen trekking to the top of Jacobs 
School of Engineering building for 
class in Fallen Star.

Clean Slates
Progressive, new A.S. Council bylaws will improve the upcoming Spring 2014 election.

ILLUSTRATION BY JEFFREY LAU

Last week’s finalization of the A.S. Council Standing Rules and Bylaws reforms comes almost a year after a grievance-filled, divisive and downright ugly elec-
tion. Slate reform had been an issue on the back burner of 
A.S. legislation for quite a while, and we couldn’t be happier 
that changes finally materialized and passed Council last 
week. The changes will empower students to pick the best 
representatives for our campus and eliminate massive slates, 
which can dominate elections and overshadow smaller slates 
and independent candidates.

Limiting slate sizes to 11 candidates works well for our 
campus elections on a number of levels. With the change, 
the only councilmembers representing the entire campus 
are the President, VP External, VP Student Affairs and eight 

campuswide senators. With these positions making up the 
full 11 spots on a slate, campuswide parties can better focus 
on broad campus issues while college-specific and academic 
senators are forced to campaign directly to constituents. The 
council’s bylaw reforms will make senators more directly 
accountable to their own constituencies and will not allow 
for candidates to win elections simply for being affiliated 
with a specific slate.

Smaller slates will also benefit voter decision making by 
drawing a stark contrast between campuswide and college-
specific issues. A.S. Council candidates — now disallowed 
from campaigning alongside college council candidates — 
will no longer be able to play favorites once elected in regard 
to funding or legislation.

technically
 speaking

There’s something about those curiously benevolent or sly self-promoting Instagram 
posts that make me skeptical of 
their purpose. I don’t know if 
people are really just obsessed with 
sharing every moment in their lives 
or if they’re really just that “good.” 

Everyone has that acquaintance 
who only posts dolled up selfies 
fishing for compliments or the 
friend who takes too many #fitlife 
“work-in-progress” mirror pics. 
Most of these pictures either have 
captions that say something along 
the lines of “I don’t mean to brag, 
but… [insert amount of weight lost 
or muscle weight gained here].” 
These awkward photos, paired with 
seemingly innocent captions, usu-
ally prompt me to roll my eyes and 
decide whether I like the person 
enough to “InstaSupport” and give 
them that extra ego boost.

After flicking through end-
less amounts of #grammys related 
photos on my Instagram feed, one 
post in particular had me shak-
ing my head for its shameless 
self-promotion. Regardless of who 
should have won the Grammy for 
“Best Rap Artist” or “Best Rap 
Album,”  Macklemore’s public 
text message apology to Kendrick 
Lamar, which he published on 
Instagram, seems suspect. The 
photo has over 200,000 likes and 
every publication talking about it, 
but to me, it just looks too much 
like seemingly “good” publicity for 
Macklemore and a meaningless 
gesture to Kendrick.

After Sunday night’s show, the 
“Same Love” artist Instagrammed 
a screenshot of an apologetic text 
message he had sent to “Kendrick 
Real” with the caption: “My text 
to Kendrick after the show.” 
Macklemore’s text message read, 
“You were robbed. I wanted you 
to win.” I wouldn’t jump to the 
conclusion that Macklemore’s mes-
sage was insincere, but posting the 
actual text on his Instagram and 
Twitter makes it look like a lame 
call for attention. 

Macklemore probably intended 
his post to be an act of kindness 
that would give Kendrick some 
public recognition for producing a 
great album, but the actual gesture 
was questionable. Macklemore’s 
Instagram post made what could 
have been a sincere gesture into an 
awkward attempt to publicize his 
niceties. It would have been better 
if he had simply acknowledged the 
talent behind “Good Kid, m.A.A.d 
City” in an interview, without hav-
ing to show us his text to Kendrick. 
Keeping the conversation private 
would have been both meaningful 
and more appropriate.

I’m not trying to give the “think 
twice before you post” lecture or 
trying to hate on every #shameless 
post on Instagram, but it’s worth 
noting that people will see through 
your humble brag. Instead of pil-
ing on the makeup and finding the 
perfect lighting to define your abs, 
you’ll get way more likes by post-
ing a picture of your dog. After all, 
around 80 percent of the photos I 
genuinely like on my News Feed are 
of adorable corgis and Shiba Inus 
that are “confident, beautiful and 
au naturale.”

HALCYON DAYS By Christie Yi

The need to separate college 
council candidates from campuswide 
slates became apparent after the June 
2013 Judicial Board decision that A.S. 
Council owed years of back funding 
to college councils. After the deci-
sion was announced, Muir, Marshall 
and Sixth College councils declined 
to force Council to begin repayment 
immediately. Although Sixth and 
Muir did end up requesting funding 
in October 2013, it seems the initial 
decision to decline the funds was a 
purely political move. Many, if not 
most of the seats on those councils 
were held by candidates who ran for 
office with “Keep it Real,” the slate 
that controls a large portion of A.S. 
Council. Separating college council 
and A.S. Council slates will prevent 
future pre-election alliances and will 
allow colleges to maintain their most 
constituent-focused priorities.

Perhaps the best-advised provi-
sion of last week’s reforms is the 
replacing of the VP Finance posi-
tion with a Financial Controller 
job. While we feel that current VP 
Finance Sean O’Neal and last year’s 
Bryan Cassella both did excep-
tional jobs, the elected position 
risks allowing a poorly qualified 
candidate to take office. In a can-
didate interview with the Guardian 
last year, one VP Finance candidate 
cited their familiarity with using the 
Triton Activity Planner form as their 
most important qualification for the 
job. When millions of dollars in stu-
dent fees are at stake, we need assur-
ance that a responsible and qualified 
person is in office. Appointing a 
Financial Controller does just that, 
since council, if logical, will only 
appoint candidates based on experi-
ence and merit.

While the VP Finance position 
will be formatted differently, A.S. 

Council is also introducing new 
positions to its roster. International 
students should now feel better rep-
resented with the addition of two 
seats in the Forum for International 
Senators. As campuswide slates 
running the 11 aforementioned 
positions will likely not prioritize 
these seats, international candi-
dates, like the academic senator 
candidates, will be forced to reach 
out directly to their smaller constit-
uencies. As a result, international 
students will be better informed 
and represented, as a successful 
candidate for the new position will 
likely campaign well among circles 
of international students.

However, not all is perfect with 
the new standing rules and bylaws. 
The major change we don’t like is the 
bylaw changes’ that snip the number 
of freshman senator positions from 
three to two. Freshman just start-
ing at UCSD are subject to the same 
representation as the rest of campus, 
but are the only constituents who do 
not elect the sitting councilmembers. 
Freshman senators are the only true 
representation for the freshman class, 
and cutting the number of positions 
limits the first-year voice on council. 
As a constituency that already makes 
up one quarter of the campus, it is 
unfair to reduce the amount of fresh-
man senator positions.

Overall, this A.S. Council can 
pat itself on the back (more than 
usual) for a job well done on bylaw 
reforms. With some luck, the Spring 
2014 elections will run smoother 
than last year’s, with new, innova-
tive forms of campaigning for aca-
demic senators and college-specific 
positions. As A.S. Council is the 
highest form of peer representation 
at UCSD, student voters are entitled 
to strong leadership, and the new 
council bylaws are the first step in 
seeing that this is achieved.

W hether you’re going for artisan vegan or non-vegan donuts or 99-cent, free-refill coffee, you’re in for the treat at the quirky-crafty Donut Bar. Donut Bar has mastered clas-
sics — the Apple Fritter is a favorite — and the specialty donuts are a 
whole other story. Candy bars, cake batter, fresh fruit, and bacon are 
just a few of the fillings and toppings that await. Donut Bar ensures 
that you have a sweet start to your day. Whether it be their inexpen-
sive donuts ($1-$4) or amiable staff, you and your wallet will leave 
feeling at ease.

I f you’re looking for some sweets, souvenirs and entertainment for the whole family, look no further. The quaint community of Seaport Village is a popular stop for tourists. Restaurants and 
shops (especially the Seaport Fudge Factory) all surround the central 
stage where regular performances are given, such as live Latin music. 
Seaport Village also borders the Embarcadero Marina Park North, a 
great picnic stop with friendly vendors spread throughout it, like rock 
balancers and caricature artists.

T here aren’t too many Irish pubs in San Diego, but Stout Public House may just as well be one of the best. Consider great pub favorites — like Corned Beef and Cabbage and Guinness Stew 
— at an affordable $10 to $15 per person dinner price and featuring 
locally grown and organic ingredients; throw in a daily happy hour 
from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. and an available selection of Canadian beers. 
Top it off with supreme service and a lively, near-authentic United 
Kingdom/Ireland pub ambiance and you have Stout.

A ll the folks out there with a sweet tooth should look to Extraordinary Desserts for an upscale, sugary satisfaction. The place is known for being a 4-star, Food Network-featured 
destination for globally inspired indulgences. You’ll find their ambi-
ance warm, despite constantly lively with folks indoor and out, the 
majority waiting at the front for their dessert orders to go. House 
favorites include their Blood Orange Ricotta Torte and Chocolate 
Bread Pudding.

“M angia Bene!” — translating to “eat well” in Italian — is the credo of the Little Italy Mercato. Over 140 farm and specialty booths feature culinary treasures of cul-
tures such as fresh, organic produce, authentic foods, beautiful crafts 
and various tastings. Some of the best snack finds are found from the 
little things, like bread and oil tastings, deli-sliced meats and cheeses, 
assorted honeys, fresh-cut fruit, spread samples, and for the more 
adventurous, raw oysters straight from the sea.

I n the heart of Gaslamp Quarter is Chocolat Cremerie, where their gelato easily stands out from the rest of their menu. With small-est size (single flavor) sold at $3.95, the gelato and sorbet here is 
favored for the huge variety of unique, decadent and authentic flavors 
on top of superb quality. Treat your palate to flavors like Amaretto 
and Orange Chocolat (based off of their related liqueurs). Chocolat 
Cremerie also offers crepes, pastries, coffees and savory flatbreads just 
as delectable.

N othing like some curbside bites in the big city. Literally. It’s not unusual to see folks — from business attire to sporty — mingling and enjoying their lunch while sitting on pave-
ment. Although food trucks make appearances throughout San 
Diego’s numerous neighborhoods, those of the Downtown San Diego 
gathering please their customers with their New American (and 
often times, fusion) comfort cuisine. Food ranges from New York on 
Rye’s authentic NY deli to the upscale comfort food of Devilicious 
(like Butter-Poached Lobster Grilled Cheese and Truffled Parmesan 
Fries) and Two for the Road (New England Lobster Rolls and Cap 
N’Crunch Crab Cakes).

This week, the Guardian takes you to Downtown San Diego 
to see our picks for food, drink and places to visit.

A h, the buddy cop movie. As hackneyed and overdone as this recipe for churning out 
movies goes, the buddy cop movie 
has remained an industry favorite, 
with movies such as “The Other 
Guys” and “Hot Fuzz” proving that 
the cash cow has yet to be milked 
dry. A good buddy cop movie is 
a combination of the action and 
humor, the chemistry and chaos, as 
well as the blue-collar values and 
white-collar crime that we expect 
from Hollywood’s features. 

But for every hit, like “Lethal 
Weapon” or “Training Day,” there 
are exponentially more failures, like 
“Cop Out,” “Tango and Cash” or this 
year’s “Ride Along.” “Ride Along” is a 
typecast, predictable feature created 
from a paint-by-numbers script and 
with phoned-in performances by the 
two lead actors, Kevin Hart and rap-

per turned actor, Ice Cube. 
“Ride Along” tells the story of 

Ben Barber (Kevin Hart), a loser 
school security guard addicted to 
first-person shooters and who has 
inexplicably scored an amazing, 
beautiful woman despite his utter 
ineptitude. In order to marry her, 
Ben must first gain the approval of 
her tough cop brother James Payton 
(Ice Cube) by proving his worth and 
manliness on a “ride along” mission. 

As impressive and admirable 
as Kevin Hart’s transition from a 
stand-up comedian into an actor has 
been, his choice of movies and acting 
decisions has been unfortunate. His 
standard portrayal as an effeminate, 
screaming, high-energy jokester has 
started to grate on many an audience 
member’s nerves. His performance 
in “Ride Along” is no different; he 
jumps with boundless energy and 

disorienting speed from one cheap 
gag to the next: He’s taunted by an 
elementary schooler, and he talks 
nonsense while high on morphine. 

All of Hart’s jokes are executed 
with an empty hope that someone 
somewhere in the audience might 
decide to humor him with a sympa-
thy laugh.

His partner-in-crime is played by 
the ever-ebullient Ice Cube (“Are We 
There Yet?”), who attempts to be the 
tough guy of the buddy cop duo as 
he continues his less-than-illustrious 
acting career. Unbeknownst to 
many a Hollywood actor looking to 
phone-in a performance for an easy 
paycheck, the role of the tough part-
ner in a buddy cop movie requires 
on-the-spot, deadpan humor and 
powerful presence. 

Ice Cube makes a weak attempt 
at accomplishing this by holding 
the same, annoyed facial expression 
throughout the majority of the film, 
only breaking his grimace to make 
various, pained attempts at emoting. 

As expected, “Ride Along” is truly 
nothing special. Even if the movie 
itself spawns an occasional chuckle 
or two, the amount of laughs is 
closer to the amount in a five-second 
YouTube video or a GIF. Skip the trip 
to the theater; you’ll find more laughs 
at home.

ride  along

“Ride Along” is a weak entry into the buddy cop genre, 
sunk by Ice Cube’s chilly lack of emotion.

W e music listeners are in a love affair with the shuffle button. There are only so 
many times we can listen to one 
song after another by the same 
musician. It’s too monotonous. We 
want variation.

But every once in awhile, an 
album comes along that forces 
you to listen to each track in the 
order listed on the liner notes. 
London-based Bombay Bicycle 
Club’s fourth, full-length record, 
“So Long, See You Tomorrow,” is 
one, even for impatient audiophiles 
who are inclined to press forward 
to tune in to something new, the 
album is worth listening to, exactly 
as the band intended.

“So Long” was partly inspired by 
the work of the 19th century pho-
tographer Eadweard Muybridge, 
known for creating one of the 
motion pictures, composed of 
seamlessly blended stills of a gal-
loping horse. This cohesion is 
exactly what Bombay Bicycle Club 
has succeeded in doing with their 
new LP, albeit in musical form, 
with each track segueing smoothly 
into the next.

Of course, there are some 
potential pitfalls involved in craft-
ing such an ambitious album — for 

one, the tracks could have sounded 
like sonic clones of one another. 
But “So Long” has plenty of eclecti-
cism to spare, filled with everything 
from jingling, Christmas-like cho-
ruses in “It’s Alright Now,” to the 
quirky inclusion of Bollywood sam-
ples on “Feel.” Adding diversity to 
this already rich repertoire, recent 
single “Luna” proves to undoubt-
edly be a maturation from the 
band’s 2012 gentle electronica hit, 
“How Can You Swallow So Much 
Sleep.” The song’s ethereal dream 
pop melody and elegant synth beats 
perfectly complement frontman 
Jack Steadman’s Sufjan Stevens-like 
tenor and up-and-coming singer-
songwriter Rae Morris’s Eisley-
esque vocals.

After dodging so many pos-
sible complications with “So Long,” 
Bombay Bicycle Club has created 
a masterful tour de force that will 
satisfy even the most restless, shuf-
fle-happy music listeners. If any-
thing, listeners will make a habit of 
pressing the repeat button, cycling 
through the album’s 10 tracks over 
and over again.

ALBUM  REVIEW

GUARDIAN GOES GLOBAL
CAFE ATHENA

T ucked away in the Pacific Plaza strip mall on Garnet Avenue, Cafe Athena is a tiny 
island of Greece in Pacific Beach. 
The inside transports you to a Greek 
“taverna,” with white walls, wooden 
tables draped in white tablecloths 
and scenes of Santorini adorning the 
walls. If you enjoy Apollonia Bistro 
in the Costa Verde Center near 
campus, Cafe Athena will offer you 
some of the same good food with 
a chiller PB vibe, since the owners 
are the same. Though the restaurant 
showcases its vegetarian fare, meat 

lovers have nothing to worry about, 
as plenty of meat and seafood dishes 
are also available.

When UCSD students think of 
“Greek food,” gyros from Santorini 
Greek Island Grill in Price Center 
might be the only thing that comes 
to mind. But Cafe Athena gives the 
full Greek experience, going far 
beyond the cardboard cartons of 
food court basics (though they still 
have gyros). 

Although it’s just an appetizer, 
the skordalia ($5.89) is a favorite 
of the restaurant and diners alike. 
Skordalia is a potato spread with red 
peppers and grilled zucchini served 
with warm pita bread squares. Its 
texture is like hummus, but it’s 
lighter and has a saltier taste. The 
yemista ($11.79) is an excellent 
entree to get immersed in Greek fare. 
A whole, roasted red pepper stuffed 
with squash, Bulgar wheat, sun-
dried tomatoes and herbs constitute 
an eclectic mix but blend together 
perfectly. The pepper incubates the 
stuffing, keeping it crunchy on top, 

soft in the middle and continu-
ously warm, giving you ample time 
to appreciate the blend of flavors 
inside. If vegetarian food isn’t your 
priority for the day, try the moussaka 
($12.99), a casserole layered with 
lamb, grilled zucchini and squash.

The prices are a little steep, but 
they match the size of the portions, 
and most of the dishes are hearty. 
Come around 1:30 p.m., right after 
the lunch rush, and you’ll have 
almost the entire restaurant to your-
self. You’ll have a peaceful lunch — 
you can pretend you’re on a Greek 
vacation in the PB breeze — and by 
the end, the friendly, attentive serv-
ers will make you feel like a regular.

Overall, Cafe Athena is a great 
place relatively close to campus (for 
those with a car, a bus sticker or a 
friend) to escape for an afternoon 
and eat a hearty, authentic Greek 
meal. The feta fries you used to eat 
in PC will never taste the same.

“T he Legend of Hercules” should have been just that — legendary — but 
instead of a heroic tale, the disen-
gaging story faltered with predict-
able, cliché plot and characters. 
Even extravagant action scenes are 
tangential to the plot and fail to 
make this movie remotely worth a 
trip to the theater.

Within the first few scenes of 
the movie, it becomes clear exactly 
where the story is headed. The plot 
relies on overused tropes — a com-
petitive and jealous brother, a dam-
sel in distress, a villain that must 
be defeated — and fails to develop 
them as anything more than simple 
plot devices.

The movie is set in ancient 
Greece, where Queen Alcmene 
(Roxanne McKee) hopes for 
peace for her kingdom while 
her estranged husband, King 
Amphitryon (Scott Adkins), is 
bloodthirsty for battle. Praying 
for safety to the goddess of Hera, 
patron of women and marriage, 
Queen Alcmene is granted a way 
to bring harmony to Greece: She 
must become impregnated by Zeus 
and give birth to a son — Hercules 
(Kellan Lutz). The film executes 
this plot through a beyond-awk-
ward scene in which the queen 
has a spiritually-induced orgasm, 
complete with sheets flying around 
her. Once he finds out, Amphitryon 
gives the cold shoulder to his wife 
and Hercules, instead favoring his 
legitimate son, Iphicles.

As in most movies, years pass, 
and Amphitryon — fulfilling the 
role of the evil, villainous stepfather 
— works with Iphicles to eradicate 
Hercules as hero of the kingdom. 
They send him into battle, expect-
ing him to meet his death, but, 
of course, he is spared — and he 
comes back with a vengeance.

The dialogue between Hercules 
and his love interest Princess Hebe 
(Gaia Weiss) sounds like it came 

straight out of a cheesy, roman-
tic comedy. The screenwriters’ 
(Sean Wood, Daniel Giat, Renny 
Harlin and Giulio Steve) lacklus-
ter resumes show through in the 
forced, canned speech.

While Lutz excels in abdominal 
muscles and smoldering, his act-
ing consists mostly of grunting and 
mumbling. Hercules seems to care 
only about reuniting with Hebe, 
and he spends three-fourths of the 
movie acting like a lovesick puppy. 
Only in the end does he finally 
accept his place as the son of Zeus 
and his fate as the leader of Greece.

If sappy dialogue and the shal-
low plot aren’t enough to disap-
point viewers, overdone and incon-
sequential special effects scenes 
should do the trick. Director Renny 
Harlin is no stranger to fast-paced, 
violent films, like “Die Hard 2” and 
“A Long Kiss Goodnight,” and in 
“Hercules,” the seemingly endless 
battles and one-on-one fight scenes 
are punctuated by short, slow-
motion scenes that dramatize the 
action. The most action-filled scene 
in the movie, in which Hercules 
quickly takes out a handful of war-
riors, is engaging and flashy — but 
it has no significance to the plot. 
The filmmakers forego plot for 
scene after scene of violent, hyper-
bolic violence, and it shows.

Viewers who expect to see an 
epic story of a heroic Hercules will 
instead find an alleged “hero” pin-
ing for his love interest like a teen 
complemented with seemingly 
pointless action scenes, making the 
film a cringe-worthy disappoint-
ment. Ultimately, “Hercules” is a 
boring, flamboyant rom-com that 
will, by the end, have viewers more 
than ready to leave.

THE  legend  of  hercules

“Hercules” sets the bar low for mythic adaptations.

N o matter how good a band might be, the second album is known to be infamously 
difficult to produce. Young the 
Giant released their eponymous 
debut album in 2010. With radio-
friendly tracks like “Cough Syrup” 
and “My Body,” they performed at 
festivals, late-night shows and the 
VMAs. As if that wasn’t enough 
for the young band, The Smiths’ 
grouchy front man Morrissey (of 
all people!) praised the record in a 
blog post, making confessions about 
“break[ing] down with happiness” 
due to its “perfect tone.” When 
returning to the studio to produce 
“Mind Over Matter,” the band found 
themselves under pressure. 

The mini-documentary about 
the making of “Mind Over Matter” 
chronicles the struggles the band 
faced when writing and recording 
the album. Plagued by writer’s block, 
vocalist Sameer Gadhia worked hard 

to improve his skills as a lyricist. On 
“Mind Over Matter,” Gadhia reveals 
an introspective nature, showing vul-
nerability in lines such as “Will you 
stand by me? / ‘Cause I’m a young 
man built to fall” from the title track.

What sets Young the Giant apart 
from other bands has much to do 
with the strength in Gadhia’s unwav-
ering vocals. He harmonizes with the 
melodic arpeggios of Eric Cannata 
and Jacob Tilley’s guitars, which, in 
turn, drift back and forth between 
each other, completely in sync. Their 
smooth and cohesive sound is a 
result of having played music togeth-
er since they were teenagers.

The album is top-heavy, with 
the first half producing the stuck-
in-your-head-all-day melodies. It is 
full of energy — the guitar sound 
is heavy, the amps are turned up 
and the cymbals crash along with 
rhythmic drumming. The spacey 
“Crystallized” has a wonderfully 

catchy, melodic hook that demands 
attention, eager to please. The gentle 
ballad “Firelight” marks the midway 
point. The latter half of “Mind Over 
Matter,” however, seems neglected. 
Lacking the finesse of the previous 
songs, it feels like the album drags 
on and on.

With “Mind Over Matter,” Young 
the Giant has maintained the same 
vocally-driven, melodic guitar 
sound, although the songs feel more 
fine-tuned. The extra effort put into 
the lyrics shows somewhat, but it 
still feels like Gadhia is holding back 
slightly. Although the new album is 
heavier than its predecessor, Young 
the Giant will have to continuously 
step out of their comfort zone in 
order to develop their sound and 
improve their songwriting.

Water Polo Will Host Triton Invitational Feb. 8 to Feb. 9 Volleyball Falls to 0–6 Overall, Will 
Host No. 3 UCLA Thursday Night

“We’re talented, deep, a little older 
and are playing confident,” UCSD 
head coach Brad Kreutzkamp told 
the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“Because we have everyone back from 
last year, we’ve had time to work on 
more advanced stuff than we have in 
previous seasons, and I think we’re 
probably just ahead of a lot of teams 
right now.”

GAME 4
The Tritons repeated their quick 

start in game one in their second game 

of the day against Cal State Bakersfield. 
UCSD scored four goals in the first 
quarter and improved its lead to 11–5 
by the end of the second. Wieseler 
scored a team-high four goals against 
the Roadrunners while senior cen-
ter Melissa Bartow, Kirkland and 
Gonzales contributed two goals each 
to the win. 

Miller tacked on six saves against 
the Roadrunners to bring her weekend 
total to 14 blocks.

“We’re playing really well offen-
sively, pretty polished, but we’ve still 
got a lot to work on, particularly 
on the defensive end,” Kreutzkamp 

said to UCSD Athletics Department. 
“Our players are feeling good, but 
not too good. We want to be playing 
our best at the end of the year, not 
the beginning. They know this was 
a positive start, but there’s a long 
way to go, and I think they have the 
right mindset.”

UCSD will continue its season 
Feb. 8 to Feb. 9 by hosting the Triton 
Invitational at Canyonview Aquatics 
Center. The schedule is expected to be 
released next week.

easiest opponent for the Tritons rela-
tive to No. 5 USC, No. 6 Pepperdine 
and No. 8 BYU, yet the Rainbow 
Warriors proved tough on the court.

In the first set, both teams went 
point for point, leading to a 15–15 
score before the Rainbow Warriors 
pulled away, tallying 11 of the next 
14 points and never looked back. 
Hawaii led early in the second set, 
earning a three-point lead that was 
eventually extended to 15–7. UCSD 
lost the set 25–15. 

In the third set, the Tritons led for 
the first time in the match, 3–2 but 
failed to hold on to the advantage, as 
Hawaii managed a 25–21 set three vic-
tory to complete the match sweep.

“It’s the beginning of the sea-
son, and we’ve got a young team,” 
senior outside hitter Nick Iorfino 
said. “We are doing some things 
fairly well, and some things, not 
so good. Against Hawaii, we had a 
good defense. It helped keep the ball 
in play and gave us opportunity to 
score points, but our offense could 
need some improvement. I think we 
can make it happen.”

Iorfino led UCSD offensively 
with eight kills Friday night, while 
sophomore libero Elliot Shaw collect-

ed a team- and career-high six digs. 
Fellow sophomore outside hitter Kirill 
Rudenko drew his first college start 
and earned his first four kills, a service 
ace and two digs. 

On Sunday, the Tritons lost to 
Hawaii 25–14, 25–16 and 25–22 across 
three sets, a repeat of the Rainbow 
Warriors’ sweep from Friday. Hawaii 
opened the first set with hitting over 
.500 and picked up 13 kills. UCSD was 
credited with six service errors. 

The second set proved equally as 
frustrating for the struggling Tritons 
— Hawaii started the set with five 
unanswered points by Taylor Averill. 
The Tritons’ first lead of the night 
came when UCSD scored the first 
point in the third and final set. The 
set had seven lead changes, and 
Iorfino tacked up 12 kills to give 
the Tritons a chance to stay in the 
match. Even with the improved effort 
in the third set, UCSD fell to the 
Rainbow Warriors and returned to 
San Diego — still without a win — 
early Monday morning.

UCSD will return to action on 
Thursday night at RIMAC Arena 
against No. 3 UCLA (5–1 overall, 2–0 
MPSF), starting at 7 p.m.

The No. 8 UCSD women’s water polo team finished the UC Santa Barbara Winter Invitational with wins over all four oppo-
nents: Concordia, No. 5 Arizona State University, 
No. 17 UC Santa Barbara and Cal State Bakersfield. 
The tournament sweep advances UCSD to 4–0 on 
the season and improves the Tritons’ standing in 
the Collegiate Water Polo Association from No. 
14 to No. 8.

GAME 1
UCSD began the 2014 season with a blowout 

win against Concordia on the first day of the UCSB 
Winter Invitational. The Tritons rallied around 
the offensive performances of sophomore attacker 
Julia Kirkland and sophomore two-meter Alexis 
Wieseler, who found the back of the cage four times 
each, and senior utility Sarah Lizotte, who con-
tributed three goals. Combined with the offense, 
sophomore goalie Courtney Miller racked up two 
saves in the opener and the Tritons were up at the 
last buzzer by 21–2.

GAME 2
Following the standout Triton victory in the 

first game of the day, UCSD met No. 5 Arizona 
State University and beat the Sun Devils in an 
upset win. Wieseler tallied three more goals on 
the day, and Lizotte led the Tritons with a five-goal 
contribution to the win. Miller shut down the Sun 
Devils’ offense by managing nine saves, bringing 
her total for the day to 11. UCSD kept pace with 
the Sun Devils, never losing the lead despite a 
strong performance from the ASU offense. The 
game remained close until the end with the Tritons 
stretching their lead to 9–7 in the third quarter 
only to be outscored by ASU in the fourth, bring-
ing the final score to 12–11.

GAME 3
The Tritons defeated host team UCSB 11–7 in 

their first game of the day on Sunday. Lizotte led the 
offensive effort, scoring three goals on the day, and 
fellow senior utility Leah Gonzales and sophomore 
attacker Laurel Kistler both finding the cage twice.

UCSD started the game hot against the Gauchos 
with three goals scored in the first quarter and com-
manded a lead throughout. Miller had eight saves 
in the game, allowing the Tritons to outscore the 
Gauchos in three of four periods to pull off the win. 
The Tritons were only outscored in the third quarter, 
when UCSB scored two to the Tritons’ one and crept 
within two goals of the UCSD lead.

In a game that seemed over after 
the first pitch, the UCSD baseball team 
cruised to an easy 13–0 victory over 
the Vanguard University Lions last 
Tuesday, Jan. 28 at Triton Ballpark.

Behind the right arms of sopho-
more starter Justin Donatella and 
sophomore reliever Troy Cruz, who 
allowed a combined five hits and no 
walks, the Tritons recorded their third 
straight shutout. As a staff, the Triton 
pitchers are yet to surrender a run 
on the preseason. Donatella struck 
out eight batters, while Cruz added 
another five.

“Justin [Donatella] did a great job,” 
UCSD head coach Eric Newman told  
the UCSD Athletics Department. “All 
night long, he was really pounding the 
strike zone. He was down in the zone 
and throwing two to three pitches for a 
strike when he needed to.”

Offensively, the Tritons were 
disciplined all night against a wild 
Vanguard pitching-staff, consistently 
drawing base-runners against a staff 

that went deep into the bullpen. UCSD 
drew eight walks and recorded 12 hits 
against nine pitchers, who also hit five 
batters for the contest.

In addition to his performance 
on the mound, Cruz was also an 
offensive catalyst for the Tritons. 
Going 2-for-5 on the night, he 
scored twice, had one RBI and stole 
a base, batting in the lead-off spot 
for UCSD.

Seniors Justin Rahn and Spencer 
Frazier both had big nights. Rahn, 
playing left field, went 1-for-2 with 
a walk, two hit-by-pitches, two runs, 
two RBI and a steal. Frazier, UCSD’s 
starting second baseman, was 1-for-
3 with two walks, two runs scored 
and one RBI.

With the preseason now over, the 
Tritons prepare for their first series 
of the year against Holy Names 
University on Feb. 2 at Triton Ballpark. 
The first pitch of the doubleheader is 
set for 11 a.m.
