O.ne-rate housing plan 
set to move forward 
Cunningham wants quick action so that 
contracts can go out to continuing students 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Hous ing and Dining 
Services Advisory Committee 
voted 6-5 last week to approve 
the "one-contract, one-rate" plan 
for on-campus housing for next 
year. 

The II members of the com-
mittee sit as an advisory 'board to 
Director of HD&S Mark 
Cunningham. 

The committee consists of 
eight students and three adminis-
trative representatives. The stu-
dent representatives include one 
from each of the five colleges, one 
from the A.S. Council, one from 
the Inter-Collegiate Residents' 
Association and a resident adviser 
represe ntative. The administra-
ti ve represen ta tives i ncl ude a 
member of the council of deans, a 
repre entative of the provosts and 
a repre entative of the resident 
deans . 

T he decision was made quickly 
because HD&S needs to end 
housing contracts and room selec-
tion information to continuing 
students. In past years, this infor-

mation had already been distrib-
uted by this point in winter quar-
ter. 

T he one-rate plan is designed to 
equalize rates in residence halls and 
on-campus apartments. It will raise 
costs for on-campus apartments 
and reduce rates for residence halls 
starting next year. 

The plan will also require all 
residents, including those in apart-
ments, to purchase a meal plan. It 
will add cleaning services in apart-
ment common areas, much like 
those in suite common-areas in res-
idence halls. 

According to Eleanor Roosevelt 
College representative to the advi-
sory committee David Goodwin, 
the advisory committee discussed 
the idea of providing a waiver for 
studen'ts to opt out of the meal plan 
and/or the cleaning. 

Goodwin said this idea is being 
discussed further in committee 
meetings. 

H e said the committee and 
Cunningham are working to iron 
out the details of the plan so it can 
go into effect and the literature can 
be distributed to continuing and 
future residents.

Charity is emphasized 
during WinterFest week 
'Community-based' festivities encourage campus 
organizations, students to campaign for UCSD Cares 
By LARA MOSCRIP 
Staff Writer 

Iv!ore than 30 UCSD clubs and 
organizations will set up booths 
and tables on Library Walk this 
week when they participate in the 
Associated Students WtnterFest 
2002 UCSD Cares campaign. 

The idi!a for the weeklong 
charity drive was originally con-
ceived by the A.S. Council, which 
wished to expand the phil anthrop-
ic nature of WtnterFest. 

"We have wanted to expand 
[the charity aspect of WtnterFestJ 
for a whil e," said Brandon 
Freeman, A.S. festiva ls co-coordi-
nator. "We wanted to make it 
more community-based." 

In years past, students donated 
a can of food as admi sion to the 
concert. This year, that policy has 
been replaced \vith the weeklong 
charity drive on Library Walk. 

lyon liew/GuQrdion 
Cookout: Warren seniors Cory Miyabara (far left) and Martel Martinez (center),

Emi ly Marx, a Student 
Organization and Leadership 
Opportunities adviser and coordi-
nater of community service efforts, 
said that the UCSD Cares cam-
paign was a student-initiated event. 

"This year, the students want-
ed a weeklong campaign to benefi t 

local charities," Marx said. "We 
have been working with the stu-
dents for a few months to get this 
event together." 

T he theme of the campaign is 
"Pick your cause! Choose your 
chari ty!" and incorporates the 
diverse range of philanthropic 
causes supported by numerous 
organizations. 

On Library Walk, students can 

participate in any number of char-
ity booths sponsored by different 
organizations on campus. While 
each organization ultimately 
chose its own charity to work for, 
they all worked with the S.O.L.O. 
office to find one that was right 
for them, according to Marx.

UC spearheads Enron lawsuit, 
jumps into lead plaintiff position 

Class~action effort has university at forefront of suit 
alleging that corporate executives profited from lies 
By ANDREW QUADRI 
Senior Staff Writer 

The University of CaUfornia 
has long been the leader in acade-
mics and research; in the wake of 
the Enron collapse, it now leads a 
corporate lawsuit. 

On Feb. 15 , a Houston judge 
selected the University of 
California to lead a multibillion-
dollar class-action lawsuit against 
29 of Enron Corp.'s senior exec-
utives and former auditor Arthur 
Andersen, LLP. The lead plain-
tiff in class-action cases helps

The university's general c.oun-

sel James Holst said that partici-
pating in the lawsuit is an unusu-
al step for the university, but that 
it is justified by the "unique cir-
cumstances" of the Enron col-
lapse. 

About 60 lawsuits were com-
bined into one class-action case, 
which the university joined Dec. 
21,2001. The lawsuit alleges that 
Enron executives profited from 
misrepresenting the company's 
financial situation.

BRIEFLY 
Scholarships set up for transfer students 

Students who transfer to UCSD through the 
UniversityLink program will be eligible for one of 30 
$1,500 scholarships starting next year. 

At $249,600, the scholarship fund is the largest 
of its kind for transfer students in the history of 
UCSD. 

Sheldon and Suan Engelhom of Cardiff by the 
Sea, Calif., established the Engelhom Scholarship 
Fund to encourage high-school students to partici-
pate in UniversityLink as a way to enter UCSD. 

The Engelhorns said they seek to assist 
UniversityLink students because of their diverse 
backgrounds and commitment to higher education. 

The UniversityLink program guarantees high 
school seniors who attend community college 
admittance to UCSD if they maintain a 2.8 GPA, 
complete the 60 necessary units and receive con-
tinued academic and coltege counseling. Currently, 
the program is established between nine communi-
ty colleges and UCSD.

UCSD Stroke Center receives 
high marks 

The UCSD Stroke Center has been acknowl-
edged as one of the top university-affiliated medical 
centers in the nation for treatment of strokes by the 
University Health System Consortium. 

Medical centers were ranked on complication 
and death rates, length of patient hospitalization, 
diagnostic tests and health counseling. The study 
was conducted last year. Forty patients at the UCSD 
center participated in the study. 

UCSD ranked second, following the Medical 

College of Georgia in a nationwide survey of 33 uni-
versity-affiliated medical centers. 

Patients at UCSD were discharged sooner than 
those of any other medica I centers, and the center 
receives one of the highest numbers of patients with 
severe stroke in the nation. 

The UCSD Stroke Center is composed of five 
physicians, four nurses and two administrators. It is 
open for around-the-clock care because strokes are 
the third-highest cause of death among adults in the 
United States. 

Researchers simulate attack on 
Salt Lake City 

Because the 2002 Winter Olympics are being 
held in Salt Lake City, researchers at the University of 
Califomia's lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
announced they have developed a three-climen-
sional computer simulation to demonstrate how a 
release of biological or chemical airborne substances 
would flow in the city. 

Analysis of weather and wind data, topographical 
maps and buildings were used to portray how the 
substances would flow throughout the city and out-
lying areas. 

The study took into account changing wind pat-
ters and the downtown building environment 

The lab's National Atmospheric Release Advisory 
Center conducted the research, which was finished 
prior to the start of the Olympics. 

Los Alamos National Laboratory

Charity: 
Christian hopes that the event will 
continue in the years to come 
Continued from page 1 
out the charities represented is that they are all local. 
That was done intentionall y, according to Freeman. 

"With the recent events in New York and 
Washington , D.C., a lot of local charities were hurt 
by peopl e giving their usual donations to larger char-
ities such as the Red Cross," Freeman said . "We 
wanted to help out the smaller charities with this 
event. We have booths for just about everything you 
could think of." 

While the event runs through Friday. Freeman. 
who worked with fellow AS Festival Co-
Coordinator Mike Hayes in organizing the event, is 
already pleased with the response that the UCSD 
Cares campaign has received. 

"I am very, very impressed with the success so far." 
Freeman said. "We are really happy with the way that 
things are going so far." 

AJpha Kappa Psi. a co-ed professional business 
fraternjty. was one of the orgaruzations present. It 
encouraged passing students to create a bookmark. 
which it will donate along with school supplies. to its 
philanthropy. 

J oelle Abbott. a promoter of Parmers at Learnjng 
and Future Educators of America. encouraged stu-
dents perusing the tables on Library Walk to learn 
more about its unjque sponsoring program. Through 
this program. high-school students from under-rep-
resented Illgh schools in San Diego would accompa-
ny a UCSD student through his or her typical day, 
attend classes and walk the campus. 

In addition to the orgaruzations with tables on 
Library Walk. the colleges are also representing 
UCSD students in the general effort to coll ect 
canned food, clothing, books. blankets and funds for 
many local charities. 

The Warren College Service Club is engaging 
Warren resident hall and apartment residence advis-
ers to rally student participation and support in its 
efforts to raise canned food goods. The WCSC is 
sponsoring a canned-food drive and has plact:d 
Warren dorm and apartment dwellers in competi-
tion with each other to raise the greatest number of 
cans. 

Warren Black Hall Resident Adviser Mike Ficken 
is tempting ills residents with the prospect of a 
WCSC-sponsored pizza party for the floor of Black 
Hall that collects the most canned goods.

greatest shot of winrung." Ficken said. "I have the

The UCSD Ca.res campaign is sometlling that the 
A.S. Council would like to continue in the future. 
according to A.S. Programmer Eisha Christian. 

"When I came into office, there were- some peo-
ple that wanted to get rid of WinterFest; Christian 
said. "I thought that WinterFest was a good charity 
event and sometlling that we really needed to work 
out and expand. I hope that whoever takes over next 
year will carry on [the UCSD Cares campaign). I 
think that to get rid of it wou ld be a pity.» 

The campaign will continue through Friday with 
booths on Library Walk. 

The WinterFest concert, to be held at RIMAC 
Arena on Feb. 22. will feature artists Jason Mraz, 
Ferux TX and City High. It is the climax of the

Seven hours found to 
be optimal sleep period 
Too much sleep is as detrimental as too 
little according to UCSD study 
By LAU RA McCAN N 
Staff Writer 

Eight hours is no longer consid-
ered the ideal amount of sleep one 
should receive each rught. accord-
ing to the largest study ever done 
on the subject. 

UCSD professor Daniel Kripke, 
leader of the srudy. found that peo-
ple who sleep only six or seven 
hours each rught live longer than 
those who sleep eight or rune. 

"Our majn findings were that 
people who sleep seven. six or five 
hours a night have norrung to worry 
about, as long as they are not too 
tired to work or drive," Kripke said. 

The study surveyed the sleeping 
habits of 1.1 ntillion adults between 
the ages of 30 and 102. controlling 
demographics. habits, health fac-
tors and the use of medication. 
These findings were published in 
the Feb. 15 issue of the ArichivtS of 
Gmtral Psychiat1y, a journal of the 
American Medkal Association. 

The six-year study concluded 
that the best survival rate was found 
among those who slept seven hours 
per rught. Those who slept eight or 
more hours per night had a sigrufi-
cantly illgher mortality rate. which 
increases with the amount of sleep 
over seven hours. Those who slept 
njne or 10 hours had a nortality 
rate similar to that of people with 
moderate obesi ty. 

However. the study did not 
establish a djstinct causality between 
mortality rates and sleeping longer. 

"It is impossible to be certain of 
causality with tllis kind of study." 
Kripke said. 

Kripkc said he \~oul d like to see 
more resea rch done on the topic. 

"I hope that onc day, someune 
will restri ct long sleepers' intake to 
see the health effects. Such srudies 
would be needed to determine 
direct ~ausality." Kripke said. "We 
are not ready to say that anyone 
should set their alarms early." 

Many sleep experts have been 
Illghly critical of the tudy and its 
findings. The National Sleep 
Foundation. a nonprofit organiza-
tion interested in promoting 
healthy sleeping habits, responded 
critically to the study. especially to 
the assertion that the risks associat-
ed with sleeping pills are far more 
dangerous than the risks associated 
with insomrua. The study showed a 
25 percent increase in death risk 
with daily sleeping pill use. 

The foundation said that the 
sleeping pills aV:lllable during 1982-
1988. the time the study was con-
ducted, are di fferent from those 
available today. The foundation said 
that tllis would cause unnecessary 
alarm among sleeping pill users. 

Kripke struck back at Ills critics 
by stating they have a conflict of 
interest. 

"Much criticism is conting from 
people who receive money from 
the sleeping pill industry, which are 
worried that this study won't hel p 
their profits." Kripke said. 

He also saw hope in the fu nlre. 
"We appreciate all of the students 

who help us with our research and 
we look forward to seeing a new 
generation of researchers who will 
answer all of the unanswered sleep 
research questions," he said.

Poor judgment 
taints students' 
good intentions 

A walkout scheduled for Thurgood 
Marshall College'S Dimensions of Cu1ture 
classes was averted Friday due to a compro-
mise between Marshall Dea n of Stuaent 
Affairs Ashanti Houston-Hands and 
M<lrshall students who were angered over 
wh<lt they deemed to be unfair housing prac-
tices. 

i\1:mhall smdents claiming that their 
Residential Life Office was consptnng to 
unlawfully terminate housing contracts 
stood by their convictions ana acted out 
ag.li nst what they thought to be injustice on 
~1I1 otherwise largely apathetic college cam-
pus. The Gltfwc{ifln applaud Marsnall stu-
dents for taking a stand in a manner tbat gar-
nered quick and effective results from their 
college s admini stration. However, it is clear 
that Marshall smdents misrepresented their 
case to sensationalize the matter. 

First, the UCSD Cause Web site contra-
dicts itselfby calling for case-by-case evalu-
ations of housing violations and termina-
tions while simultaneously claiming that 
the group wanted all students to be treated 
equally. Second, Marshall students claimed 
on the site that they were l 'eing unfairly 
charged fire hazard fines because of campus 
residence overcrowding, whichis not unaer 
their control; the dean said this is false. 
Third, the site quoted California law as say-
ing that montll-to-month housing agree-
ments require 30 days notice of termination 
and that Marshall college is not abiding by 
this. However, the law goes on to say that 
pre-agreed housing arrangements, such as 
the housing contracts that students have 
with UCSD, are only reguired to give a 
mi nimum of seven days for the renter to 
evacuate the premises after being evicted. 
UCSD gives 14 days, which is fully in 
accordance with the law. 

Instead of publicly exaggerating their 
allegations in an attempt to draw the atten-
tion of the ResidentIal Life Office, the 
organizers of the walkout should have con-
tacted the dean in the first place. Houston-
Hands has proved more than willing to 
meet with the organizers and make conces-
sions to UCSD Cause; misrepresentations 
of the so-called injustices against them and 
a full-blown demonstration were unneces-
sary. 

In this case, the Marshall Dean's Office 
and the Marshall Dean of Student Affairs 
acted admirably, recognizing the smdents' 
concerns and extending evictions until the 
end of the <l.uarter even though they had 
operated lawfully all along. In being open 
about the matter, Houston-Hands was able 
to explain all of the Marshall students' 
claims. Had the event organizers simply con-
tacted her first! they_ would have been give!) 
an understandll1g of why housing termina-
tion are on the rise and where they can find 
information about the consequences of vio-
la [ions. 

While it is good to keep a close watch on 
the administration to ensure that it is acti ng 
fairly toward all students, an unwillingness 
to directly resolve I)roblems using the prop-
er channels is not t 1e most mature or honor-
able way to initiate change.

American vanity, greed and ego spawn 
retaliation from many foreign nations 
America's arr.ogance in the global arena is -
responsible for fueling hostility toward the u.s. 
By ANDREW QUADRI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Think of the guy who drives around 
your neighborhood every day in a 
sport-utility vehicle the size of an 
armored truck, blasting the stereo at 
jet-engine decibel tevels. Stop signs? 
Optional , even with children in the 
street. 

He doesn't care about anyone but 
himself, and why should he? In his eyes, . 
he's Da Bomb, yo. 

At any rate, you'd punch him in the 
eye if you ever got the chance. He's the 
biggest jerk on the block and everybody 
knows it. Well, everybody except him. 

On a global scale, the United States 
is that jerk and Sept. II was our punch 
in the eye. 

Swaggering around the world and 
pissing on everyone we can to further 
America 's own economic interests is a 
quick way to make a lot of enemies, and 
that's just what we have done . 

Nobody has a problem with the 
ideals of democracy, not even terrorists, 
I suspect. Democracy by itself - and 
done right - could save the world. 

But the attacks were not an attack on 
democracy, on New Yorkers, or on 
World Trade Center workers . 

What happened Sept. 11 was an 
attack on capitalism . It attacked the 
people in charge of it - the rich - and 
the people who make it work - the rest 
of us. That's what Osama bin Laden 
says in his videos. 

T he rest of the world no lo nger sees 
a separation between global capi talism 
and the U . . government. There is no 
rca on to see anythi ng cIse. 

Bush's presidential campa ign 
received 97 percent of its $100 million 
from about 800 individuals and corpo-
rations. Gore did basically the same 
thing. ven with campaign- finance 

reform, the notion that democracy is a 
privilege still extended to nonmultimil-
lionaires is a joke. 

How much is $97 million? Take all 
3,560 Marshall students, pay them 
$27,000 per year to work and wait 12 
months - just don't expect them to pay 
rent or buy anything in the meantime 
- and there's your $97 million. What 
is an entire year's work to 3,560 people 
is pocket change to the rich. 

Rich people don't care much about 

We love knowing that as 
Americans, we can have 
anything, take anyth ing, 

and expect the rest of the 
world to shine our shoes 
while we're doing it. We 

love that it makes us feel 
powerful, but that doesn't 

make it right. 

you unless you are helping them make 
money. That's how they made their 
money in the first place: by getting you 
to work for them as cheaply as possible. 
If finding cheap labor means moving 
jobs out of America and into Third 
World countries, that's fine - it's more 
money for them. 

If you don't think they would treat 
you worse if they could, think agai n. 
Look at that shirt you're wearing. Yes, 
the one with the label that reads "Made 
in U.S.A." The Aag motif is awfully 
patriotic and misleading for something 
that was probably made in a Saipan 
weatshop. Saipan is a U.S. territory 

near the Phillipines, but lacks the fancy 
things associated with our country such 

as decent labor laws . 
The United States was recently 

kicked off the U .N . Human Rights 
Commission panel. Sudan and Libya 
were voted in. It was a proud day for 
America , I'm sure. 

The corporations that run our 
nation are responsi ble for wars, child 
labor, indentured se rvitude, and world-
wide environmental destruction . They 
praise ufreedom" and "democracy," 
even as they contradict those principles 
domestically and abroad. And we take 
their bait. 

Everybody else in the world sees it, 
though. Get a European pen pal and 
ask him about it. Watch the "BBC 
World News." It's there. 

We love knowing that as Americans, 
we can have anything, take anything, 
and expect the rest of the world to 
shine our shoes while we 're doing it. 
We love that it makes us feel powerful, 
but that doesn't make it right. 

Americans did not deserve what 
happened Sept. 11 and the rest of the 
world does not deserve what we do to 
it, either. We share responsibility for 
the attacks. Terrorists will not rel ent 
until we stop raping the rest o f the 
world. 

To help explain : Say I was walking 
down the street and some guy suddenly 
decked me. He was justified , though, 
because I'd slept with his girlfriend and 
he found out. I'd sti ll fight back, even 
though he had a reason to attack me. 

But say that I slept with someone 
else's girlfriend a few weeks later. Next 
thing ( know, htr boyfriend is punching 
me and so are the two friend s he 
brought to help. I'd still fight back. 

Another two weeks pass and the 
same thing happens for the same rea-
son.

Would-be spy unveils 
foolishness of Pentagon 
Proposal to plant false information and promote 
pro-American propaganda lacks coinmon sense 

neurotica 
, DrVYA RUNClIAL 

I once wanted to be an international 
spy. Initially, my par-
ents thought it was 
cute. Then, tragedy 
struck and I realized 
my chances of being 
on the CIA's payroll 
were about as good 
as the safety record of 
Pan Am . . 

After [ began accusing friends 
and rel ati ves of being spies for 
other countr ies, drastically reduc-
ing the number o f parti es my par-
ents were invited to, I was encour-
aged to seek ca reers in other 
"practical" pro fe ssions such as 
medicine , law md engineering. 

I was tal ked o ut of a career in 
international espionage quite eas-
ily. I had no idea how much work 
went into becoming a spy. 

An elite government agency 
needs employees who can keep 
their mouths shut. Even I knew 
that telling me classified informa-
ti on was like giving a thief keys to 
a ca r ; in short, it was dangerous 
and irresponsible. 

O n top of that , I learned that r 
had to have expertise in an area 
th at an agency could use to 
co unter terrorism. Although I was 
skilled in ea ting an enormous 
amount of food in a si ngle sitting, 
I concluded that an inte lli gence 
age ncy had . no need for people 
with th ose "talents." 

As time went on, I was indoc-
trinated with numerous tales of 
corrupti on and evil at the top lev-
els of government. I gradually lost 
my enthusiasm for working for 
age nci es such as the CIA, the 
National Security Agency and the 
Pentagon. 

Until recently I still thought 
that those intelligence agencies -
while plagued with certain prob-
lems - fundamentally served 
some good purpose. This is why I 
am so shocked by recent events 
that suggest certain "intelligence" -
agencies may not be so intelligent 
after all . 

I reali ze that the Pentagon has 
a difficult task of maintaining 
some semblance of order after the 
Sept. 11 attacks. Nevertheless, the 
mil itary'S plan to disseminate false 
information to foreign media 
organizations, as an effort to pro-
mote American views or criticize 
anti-American governments, is 
ridicurous and absurd. 

The office handling this, creat-
ed after the terrorist attacks, is the 
Office of Strategi~ Influence. 
Even some senior Pentagon offi-
cials have voiced th eir hesitation 
about the plan, which s till awaits 
approval from the Bush adminis-
tration. 

Supporters have said that the 
new Pentagon office will help 
infl uence attitudes toward the 
United States in the Middle East 
and beyond. Whether this is the 
best way to change opinions about 
the U .S. government is unknown . . 
If the programs are implemented 

Until recently I still 
thought that those 

intelligence agencies -
while plagued with 
certain problems -

fundamentally served 
some good purpose. 
That is why I am so 
shocked by recent 

events that suggest 
certain "intelligence" 
agencies may not be 

so intelligent after all. 

in nations already hosti le toward 
tl,e United States, we rn.ay only 
further damage our image. 

The executive in charge of the 
OSI, Brig. Gen. Simon P. Worden 
of the U.S. Air Force, has already 
proposed guidelines for the cam-
paign. He would have strategic 
campaigns use the Internet and 
foreign media outlets to help pro-
mote American interests and dis-
pel suspicious atti tudes toward the 
United States. Included among 
one of the office's proposals is 
deliberately placing false stories 
and spreading them among for-
eign media organizations. 

I realize that the United States 
often looks like a big bully to 
some nations and is eager to 
revamp its ilnage after the military 

campaign in Afghanistan, but 
think it is fooli sh and dal)gerous 
to plant false stories portraying 
the government in a positive light 
and then in tentionally spread 
them among various organiza-
tions. This would diminish public 
trust in our institutions. 

I sincerely doubt that Middle 
Easterners, confli cted by decades-
long, deep-rooted problems with 
the United States and its foreign ' 
policy, are suddenl y going to 
change their attitudes once the 
United States begins proliferating 
pro-America propaganda. 

Even though I am only 20 
years old and have no e .~perience 
or firsthand knowledge of the mil-
itary's inner operations , ( know 
stupidity when I see it. The 
Pentagon's obvious lack of com-
mon sense is perhaps what bothers 
me most about this entire opera-
tion. 

Why tell the Ameri can publi c 
that you are goi ng to release fal se 
information in other countri es as 
a highly coordinated effort to 
change opinions toward us, and 
then expect other nations not to 
know about the. program? 

It seems idiotic that th e 
Pentagon, fueled by hundreds of 
millions of taxpayer dollars and at 
least a few th ousand rational 
employees, completely over-
looked the blatant fact that once 
other nations hear about the 
Pentagon 's plans, ill feelings 
toward this administration will 
only increase and make foreign 
media outlets more suspicious of 
the information filtering through 
their borders. The Pentagon's 
proposal to disseminate lies will 
only heighten tensions and aggra-
vate con Aicts . 

As an aspiring top secret spe-
cia l agent, I would like to believe 
that the top branches of our gov-
ernment understand the conse-
quences of enacting such propos-
als. I would not want to work for a 
government that lacks the intel -
lect to carefull y think through 
whether implementing plans such 
as these will actua lly eradicate lin-
gering resentment. 

The Pentagon 's proposal may 
in faet serve as a catalyst for fur-
ther anti-American sentiment in 
the Middle East and beyond. The 
government must be aware of 
that. 

And now that I think of it, 
maybe my mom was right - a 
career in engineering doesn't 
sound so 'bad afrer all. 

Exploring the depths of the female 
mind reveals appreciation, not jealousy 
Contrary to popular belief, females do not desire male anatomy 
By AURELIA AGUILAR 
Staff Writer 

I am a 22-year-old woman. I do 
not claim to know much about the 
male psyche, or even th e female 
psyche, for that matter. In fact, I 
am constantly perplexed by the 
characteristics of both sexes. 

There are two words occasion-
all y uttered by the raging testos-
terone that is ma n that I believe to 
be absolutely ridiculous. The two 
words I am speaking of: "penis 
envy." 

What exactly does this mean? 
That I envy all the men who walk 
around with Slinkies between their 
legs) Or perhaps, I too wish that I 
had an additional member attached 
to my body that I could give a 

name? No boys, sorry. The only 
thing that I envy about the penis is 
that it allows you to pee without 
sitting down . 

OK, I must admit that the penis 
appears to come with some advan-
tages. For one, the lines that form 
in the men's restroom go twice as 
fast as the women's. Also, there is 
the user-friendly underwear specif-
ically made for quick access. But 
this is hardly enough to make me 
run out and buy one from my doc-
tor, 

Just to be clear, r am not knock-
ing tho e who have a penis, but 
"envy" suggests that 1 am unsatis-
fied witll the anatomy of women. I 
think most would agree with me 
when I say that women's bodies are 
beautiful. 

So what is there to envy? If not 
the actual penis, is it what the penis 
stands for to most men l 
Masculini ty? Strength? A license to 
act perverted and pretend that I am 
doing it on the behalf of a littl e 
frie nd below my belly button? 

The truth is that generally 
women do not want to have a penis. 
( say generally beca use there are 
transgendered people who would 
disagree with this. Women don't 
envy what you have there between 
your legs, men! We love our bod-
ies. 

So the next ti me the words 
"penis envy" are about to roll off 
your tongue, think of another 
phrase that more accurately 
expresses how women really feel : 
"penis appreciation."

Orgies may have been 
part of Berkeley class 
Investigation leads to allegations 
of improper instructional methods 

(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, 
Calif. - The UC Berkeley male 
sexuality class, which came 
under fire last week, has been 
suspended by administrators 
while an investigation into 
reports of illicit class activities is 
conducted. 

The class' female counterpart 
is also under review but has not 
been suspended, officials said. 

A meeting among the instruc-
tors of the student-run classes 
took place Friday, following an 
inquiry intO the classes by The 
Daily Californian. But when the 
instructors of the male sexuality 
class failed to show up, the class 
was pulled, according to George 
Breslauer, dean of social sciences 
at UC Berkeley. 

Students and instructors of the 
class told the Daily Cal they took 
trips to strip clubs and "sex 
exchanges" and watched an 
instructor stri p. Some also said a 
party a t an instructor's house 
included group sex and a "party 
game" that had students pho-
tOgraphing their genitalia and 
then trying to match the pictures 
to the correct body. 

Those activities came as a sur-
prise to the professor charged 
with overseeing the course, 
Caren Kaplan, who is also chair-
woman of the women's studies 
department. She told the Daily 
Cal she does not "police the con-
tent." 

But now Kaplan is heading 
the investigation into the 
reports, which have attracted 
national media attention, 
Breslauer said . 

Under tlle policies guiding the 
classes, dubbed "DE-Cals" for 
Democratic Education at Cal, the 
sponsori ng professor must sign 
off on the curriculum allP then is 
"responsi ble for the content" of 
th e class. 

A second system of checks is 
intended, requiring the head of 
the spc1nsoring department to 
agree "that the course is an 
appropriate one for his or her 
department. " 

But since Kaplan is both the 
sponsoring professor and the 
chairwoman of the department, 
no ~econdary approval was need-
ed. 

She could not be reached for 
commenr over the weekend. 

Breslauer, her immediate 
supervisor, said it was "too pre-
mature" to make a detennination 
of wrongdoing on Kaplan'S part. 
He said DE-Cal classes are "run 
with very little faculty oversight," 

Enron: 
Though lead plaintiff, UC 
did not suffer greatest loss 
Continued from page 1 
California over a Florida-New 
York group and an Ohio-
Washington -Georgi a-Alabama 
group . Each group lost about 
$400 million. 

10 her ruling Harmon said the 
Florida-New York group did not 
persuade her that it was "the kind 
of cohesive group envisioned by the 
statute for lead plaintiff." 

The lead plaintiff in c1ass-
action cases is typically the party 

and added, "that will probably 
change." 

The DE-Cal program cur-
rently is offering more than 100 
courses, the topies of which range 
from the history of Afghanistan to 
counting cards in blackjaclc. The 
classes are not funded by the uni-
versity, but are provided use of 
campus facilities and count for 
one to two units toward gradua-
tion. 

The program is regarded as a 
triumph for liberal, democratic 
education. But some fear the 
activities in the male sexuality 
class have endangered the entire 
program. 

Aside from indicating more 
supervision may be on the hori-
zon, administrators have not said 
there will be drastic changes to 
the program. Instructors of the 
female sexuality class already have 
begun to distance themselves 
from its male counterpart. 

"The male and female sexuali-
ty classes are two separate classes 
and are in no way affiliated," said 
Kim Brodslcy, an instructor of a 
female sexuality class. "We sup-
port and defend the curriculum of 
our course as educational and 
empowering, and we are looking 
forward to teaching this class for 
yejlrs to come." 

[nstructors of the two-unit 
male sexuality class likewise 
defended their curriculum. Drew 
Navarro, one instructor, said the 
classes "provide a much-needed 
forum" for discussion of "how 
students really feel about them-
selves and their bodies and oth-
ers." 

The course descri pti on on 
the DE-Cal Web site states that 
the class is "intended to provide 
a safe eAvironment in which men 
may learn about their own bod-
ies and . male sexuality. This 
course alms to create a greater 
community of men and women 
who are empathetic, under-
standing and supportive of each 
other's sexuali ty." . 

Some sttldents enrolled in the 
male sexuality class are now 
searching for other classes to get 
their course load above their 
colleges' minimum unit require-
ment for full-time student desig-
nation - typically 11 to 13 
units. 

"Current students are paying 
the price for alleged wrongdo-
ings last semester," Breslauer 
said.

The Daily California71 

that has suffered most. The 
Florida state pension fund lost 
$325 million, the most of any 
party in the case. 

Harmon said that because the 
University of California was a sin-

Grand jury 
indicts two in 
murders of 
professors 
Teen -age suspects 

a~egedly killed 
Dartmouth profs 
in ATM burglary 

(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H. 
- A grand jury indictment released 
Tuesday claims that Robert Tulloch 
and James Parker murdered 
Dartmouth College professors Half 
and Susanne Zantop during the last 
in a string of robbery attempts 
stretching back to July 2000. 

Tulloch and Parker 
approached a house in Vershire, 
Vt., on or about July 19, 2000, 
with the intent to kill the residents 
after obtaining the personal iden-
tification numbers for their ATM 
cards, according to the indict-
ment. It says that this and three 
subsequent attempts failed when 
the suspects could not gain entry 
to the home. 

The fifth attempt succeeded 
when Half Zantop let Tulloch and 
Parleer into the professors' home 
after the teen-agers claimed they 
were conducting an environmental 
survey for a school project, accord-
ing to the indictment. Half Zantop 
brought the twO teen-agers into his 
study to answer the questions on 
their phony environmental survey, 
the indictment says. 

Grafton County Superior 
Court released the indictment 
documents Tuesday morning, 
charging Tulloch, 18, with con-
spiracy to commit murder - a 
separate charge from the pre-
existing first-degree murder 
indictment. Tulloch's lalVyers have 
said that he will use an insan ity 
defense at t ri al, slated to begin 
April 22. 

The new charge is not likely to 
warrant a separate trial. 

"The state will seek to consoli -
date the new indiconent with the 
pending first-degree murder 

.charges," New Hampshire 
Attorney General Philip T. 
McLaughlin said in a release. 

The release of the indictment 
documents marks the first time that 
the prosecution has offered the 
public detailed evidence that the 
murders were premeditated. It also 
offers a far more thorough docu-
mentation of the suspects' activities 
on the day of the killings than had 
been seen previously. 

The indictment does not 
describe the killings of the Zantops:

accused of filing frivolous lawsuits 
and of charging excessive legal 
fees, and is also being investigated 
by a federal grand jury for alleged-
ly paying clients to participate in 
lawsuits. 

"The court is aware of the high-
ly publicized criticism of Bill 
Lerach," Harmon stated, but also 
wrote that the firm "stands out in 
the breadth and depth of its 
research and insights." 

The University of California 
would not say what it intends to pay 
Milberg Weiss, but UC spokesman 
Trey Davis said the expected com-
mission was "considerably lower 
than the 15 percent to 18 percent 
average."

8 HIATUS 

By LINDSAY BOYD 
Senior Staff Writer 

r'1 he road to rock stardom has been a long and winding 
.-J one for Jason Mraz. Born in Virginia, Mraz began 
playing guitar at the ripe old age of IS. During a brief stint 
in New York, the streets of Manhattan and a bout of psychic 
intervention inspired Mraz to write music. When a fortune-
teller in Central Park told J ason to "go with what you know." 
Mraz, in true Horatio Alger fashion, went west, cnding up in 
San Diego onstage at legendary Java Joe's in Ocean Beach. 

While performing has long been a part of his life, Mraz's 
career could have easily turned out completely different. At 
age 13, Mraz sang in a wannabe boy-band called Dressed to 
Kill , and by the time college rolled around, he left Virginia 
for New York's American Musical and Dramatic Academy 
to study - believe it or not - jazz, tap and ballet in hopes 
of finding a job in musical theater. 

However, it was the lights of subway tunnels, not 
Broadway, that eventually beckoned Mraz, and before long, 
he was moving between the rail lines and jamming in parks. 

During a trip to Las Vegas, Mraz got lucley - not at the 
casino - while performing for a group of people that 
included his future manager Bill Silva. 

Silva, who was moving to Los Angeles, let Mraz move 
into rus San Diego home and encouraged him to explore 
San Diego's music scene. Mraz found his way to the coffee 
house circuit, hooking up with Toca Rivera, who backs 
Mraz up with djembe drums and vocal harmonies. 

On a fateful night at Java Joe's, Silva convinced owner 
Joe Flamini that Mraz was worth a shot. He didn't even 
have his own guitar with him and had to borrow singer-
songwriter Carlos Olmeda's guitar to play. 

That was two years ago, and now Mraz is following in 
the footsteps of San Diego all-stars . Mral: is the nen in a 
long line of San Diego folkies who can recount the good 
times had at Java Joe's. 

Those times, however, have changed . 
The Java Joe's that Mraz debuted at is now a Starbucks, 

and the new java Joe's located a couple blocks away on 
Bacon Street is now serving alcohol and is 21-and-up. 

Mraz is now splitting his time between playing gigs in 
an Diego and recording for Elektra records in Los 

Angeles. Mraz might just be the next big thing, and fortu-
nately for UCSD, WinterFest is another stop on Jason's 
winding road to fame.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

111/ hen the curtain lifts on City High at this year's WinterFest, UCSD studentS will experience this 
unique hip-hop, R&B trio at an exciting time in its fairly 
short existence. 

Robby Pardlo (20), Claudette Ortiz (IS) and Ryan Toby 
(20) come from Willingboro, NJ., and they make up City 
High. The group is nominated for a Grammy in the "Best 
R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group with Vocal" cate-
gory and is rapidly gaining an audience as the result of two 
hi t singles. 

City High attributes its ascent to its unique blend of 
lyrical intensity and musical prowess. . 

"Our music is something totally different; all of our 
songs have depth and contain provocative lyrics with mes-
sages that relate to real issues," proclaims Toby on the 
City High Web site. "You'll notice how we are able to 
express 'a message on every track without preaching. No 
matter what city you're from, our music is what gets you 
high." 

City High's Grammy-nominated single "What Would 
You Do," from its eponymous debut album, proves the 
groups dedication to exploring important issues through 
music; the song tells the true story of a woman forced into 
selling her body to feed herself and her baby. . 

Pardlo and Toby were inspired to write the song when, 
at a party, they saw a woman with whom they went to 
junior high school stripping; they pulled her aside and 
heard the Story that is played out in the song. 

A lesser-known track, "Nothing Stays The Same," 
depicts the experience of fearing for one's safety at school. 

The group, which is the first act on Booga Basement 
Records, a joint venture by Wyclefjean, jerry Wonder and 
Interscope Records, wrote and arranged most of its debut 
album. jean and Wonder, a major writing and producing 
duo in the hip-hop world, intentionally took a hands-off 
approach with the group. 

"They helped us some, but they let us do our own 
thing," Toby stated. 

Toby, a pianist and experienced vocal arranger, played 
the primary role in the creative process. His production 
credits include Will Smith's hit "Miami." Toby's resume 
also boasts a supporting role in the Whoopi Goldberg film 
"Sister Act 11 ."

Staff Writer 

r-t he band that toured with blink-I 82 in 2000 is quick 
.-J to point out that they are distinctly different. The 
continuously touring, half-Hispaniclhalf-Caucasian band 
Fenix TX spends the majority of its time traveling, despite 
being ridiculed by other bands in Houston for driving to 
California to playa few shows. 

But their response to these critics is, "[You] don't realize 
the scene that's out there." 

Not only are these guys brave in traveling far distances 
to playa few shows, they're also smart in building a grow-
ing harem of adoring fans. 

And knowledgeable businessmen they are. 
They pay for themselves when on tour instead of relying 

on tour support money, and in the process they have become 
self-sufficient and independent of M1V or fickle radio sta-
tions. The heavy driving eventually became taxing, however, 
and the band has since relocated to swmy San Diego. 

It was here that they were fortunate enough to be 
launched to fame by a certain lovely female . Band member 
Damon De La Paz's girlfriend happened to be the sister of 
blink-182's Mark Hoppus. With her unintentional help, 
Hoppus was captured by their music and he later became 
the ~and's mentor and advocate by taking them on tour 
with blink-1S2. He also assumed the role of manager for 
FenixTX. 

Their new album, "Lechuza," is named after a Tex-Mex 
follctale used to scare children into staying indoors at night. 
The members of Fenix TX recall being frightened by 
accounts of a bird-like witch creature, the Lechuza, that is 
said to swoop down and kill children at night. 

All four members (Adam Lewis, De La Paz, WIlliam 
Salazar and James Love) shared this same aspect of their 
childhoods in Texas. As Salazar stated, "It was just kind of a 
shock to us that everybody in the band knew about the myth. " 

Although they have this childhood legend in common, 
each remembered "little differences in the way it was told," 
according to Salazar. These similarities and differences 
between these friends are the same differences that make 
for a surprisingly unique album. 

With the album chock full of an eclectic array of songs, 
Fenix TX shows their maturation since their self-titled

UCSD students kee.p their dreams of 
stardom alive with music 
Driven and Straight No Chaser are two of the bands 
trying to balance schoolwork and band practice 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

What do the resumes of Bruce Springsteen, all four members of U2 and Britney Spears have in common? 
None include any sort of four-year degree. 

Obviously, a college degree is not the 
required ingredient to success in the world of 
popular music that it is in almost e\'ery other 
industry. In fact, in raday's ultra-competitive 
music scene, time spent attending coll ege 
may even hinder success because higher edu-
cation squanders portions of aspiring musi-
cians' precious youths. 

Spencer Pforsich and Brandon Stewart, 
both of whom are UCSD students and lead 
si ngers/guitarists of up-and-com ing bands, 
arc exceptions to this increasingly strict rule 
of popular musical success. 

For fres hman Brandon Stewart, who came 
to UCSD because of the strong local music 
scene and because he wanted to continue 
challenging himself academically, finding 
time for school and his punk band, Driven, is 
an absolute necessity. Although Stewart is the 
only member of hi s four-person band attend-
ing school away from the band's home in 
Valencia, Calif., Stewart finds time to make 
the two-hour trip back hOllle whenever possi-
bl e to take care of band bus iness. 

As a testament to his hard work, Driven 
managed TO pla y six shows last quarter and 
four so far thi s quarter to audiences ranging 
from 20 to 300 people. early all of the 
shows arc in the Los Angeles. area at venue~ 
such as the RQ):y and the Whisky-A-Go-Go, 

although Stewart is trying to set up some 
dates in the San Diego area to satisfy the 
group's growing fan base at UCSD . 

Moreover, Stewart is "very happy" with 
his academic performance so far. 

In the words of Stewart, "I love it so 
much, and me band is so tight as buddies, I 
make it work. " 

Spencer Pforsich, a sophomore writing 
major, also found a happy balance between 
hi s musical and academic goals. 

Without a doubt, Pforsich 's band, 
Straight No Chaser, an "emo-pop" three-
some that plays both locally and on campus, 
is where PForsich's dreams lie. lronically, 
Pforsich hopes that one day "music and 
school wi ll [indeedl conflict," and he will be 
able to play music for a living. After all, 
"school can wait, " he proclai ms. 

But for now, Pforsich realizes that school is 
necessary, if nothing else, for the help it gives 
him in the creative process. Pforsich, the 
songwriter of the ban~ finds that his studies in 
poetry aid his songwriting by helping him 
"commwlicate emotions through music." 

Stewart summed up the daily struggle of 
student musicians such as himself and 
Pforisich: "You have to be dedicated. I mean, 
that is why. we call ourselves ' Driven' : 
because we are so driven." 

Look to http'//wvwv.drivenmusicorg for Driven

ning a tour this summer. Straight No Chaser and 
its upcoming show dates and times can be

'Queen of the Damned' leaves bad 
taste in mouths of audiences 
Decent performances abound, but plot is unsatisfactory 
in portraying the elaborate culture of the undead 
By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Staff Writer 

In the dark, lonely world of the vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), the prospect of spending all of eternity in isolation pre-
sents a daunting and terrible future for the 
lonely vampire. 

Awoken by the stylish jammings of an 
obscure goth band, Lestat promises to deliv-
er to the miscreants of society all they have 
ever dreamed of, and, as a result, rouses 
Akasha (Aaliyah), the Queen of the Damned. 

After the seriousness of "Interview with 
the Vampire," the concept of a rock star vam-
pire who wakes up an ancient Egyptian vam-
pire seems a bit preposterous, but it might 
have been successful anyway if it had been 
more original and less silly. 

In contrast to the beautifully natural and 
somewhat tragic atmosphere in the early 
parts of the film, later moments arc remnis-
cent of "Superman" and "The Matrix" with 
computer-enhanced fight scenes. These 
should have added to the overall essence of 
the film, but instead leave it unrealistic and 
cartoon-like. 

Townsend d!!livers a strong performance 
as the despondent vampire more welcoming 
of death than solitude. Vincent Perez adds 
humor to the serious Marius, the vampire 
who created Lestat. Beside these more sea-
soned actors, Aaliyah (although we desper-
ately wish to like her) does not play the evil 
undead queen mother convincingly and 
instead moves about alcwardly as an exotic 
temptress. Among the supporting characters,

REVIEW 

Marguerit Moreau delivers a flawed perfor-
mance as an orphaned English girl enchant-
ed by Lestat, losing her English accent 10 
minutes into the film . 

Although part of the cast does a decent 
job of portraying their respective characters, 
the uneven fluctuations in voices as well as 
the fantastic depictions of extravagant con-
certs and superhero powers make the film 
unrealistic. Instead, it is the soundtrack that 
best depicts the turbulent atmosphere and 
has a strong and powerful effect on the audi-
ence, with tracks from artists such as 
Disturbed, Marilyn Manson and Papa Roach. 

There are some redeeming qualities to 
the film, including the humorous and witty 
remarks by Lestat and Marius, as well as the 
frivolous fans who cannot help but induce 
laughter. But overall, "Queen of the 
Damned" is unsuccessful for a film that once 
had potential.

domestic issues ("Pasture of Muppets") and 
even smooth ballads ("Tear Jerker"). 

Other punk bands that pen their own music 
fuce the dilemma of ending up with an album 
on which the tracks start to form one long 
droning song because they all sound the same. 

As De La Paz stated, "[Our] whole goal is 
every time we put something out, it's going 
to be different from what we did before." 

Fenix TX succeeds in producing unique 
and pleasing sounds that are sure to be please 
the crowd at WinterFest 2002.

'0' packs jealousy, rage into a 
modem story of teen-agers 
Latest film rendition of Shakespeare's 
'Othello' goes into overdrive with DVD extras 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

At first glam:e, any critic with an ounce of respect for the classics would scoff at the Tim 
Blake Nelson film "0." 

Alter all, the film, which trans-
poses the entire plot of Shakespeare's 
"Othello" into a mooem race-rela-
tions setting, replaces swords with 
basketballs and features a cast of 
three teenage heart-throbs - aU to a 
backdrop of hip-hop music. 

However, as the two-disc DVD 
set of the film makes blatantly clear, 
the cast and crew behind "0" 
turned hours of careful deliberation 
and hard work into an awe-inspir-
ing film experience that masterfully 
weaves in the aforementioned moo-
ern elements to take Shakespeare's 
message of the dangers of jealousy 
to a new generation. 

The DVDs themselves 2fe not 
anything particularly unbelievable; 
what brings the product into the 
realm of must-buy is how the DVD 
features take an already amazing 
film and further enhance the view-
ing experience. 

The main feature responsible 
for the incredible quality of the 
DVD set is Tim Blake Nelson's 
full-length commentary, which dis-
cusses everything from references 
to Shakespeare's original text to the 
difficulties in releasing the film due 
to the events in Columbine, Colo., 
which occurred during the editing 
process. 

Similarly, the deleted scenes pro-

@I---RE-V~:W_D 
vide more opportunities to listen and 
watch the genius of Nelson at work. 

The DVD set does not falter on 
a technical level. It includes both 
widescreen and full-screen versions 
of the film, as well as Spanish subti-
tles. The image fidelity and sound 
quality are nothing to gawk over, 
but most viewers will be so wrapped 
up in content of the film that such 
details will not matter. 

And as if "0" fans did not have 
enough extra material to enjoy, 
there is also a full-length version of 
the original silent "Othello" hidden 
away on the second DVD. A quick 
comparison of the two films will 
show how far the film industry has 
progressed, not only technological-
ly, but in honesty of subject matter 
as well. 

When all is said and done, the 
"0: 2-Disc Deluxe Edition" DVD 
set is an amazing experience on 
both the film and DVD level. This 
is a must-buy for anyone inter·ested 
in the film.

the notable "Broken" EP, 
this servcs, as do many 
albums of thc tour catego-

ry, as a sort of "best oP' 
\~ithout actually having to 
advertise it as sllch. 

But at least with NrN, 
every time a song gets 
released, it gets a fresh new 
coat of paint and a new 
remix. Sometimes the risky 
venture of attempting to 
capture highly emotional 
music reveals the limita-
tions of recording a live 
performance. . 

Largely, though, the 
angst and seething torment 
come through in pristine 
anguish. 

Some songs get an inter-
esting nose job between 
everything involved in the 
recording. 

Case in point: the last 
line of "Hun," the closing 
track from the massive 
" Downward Spiral." The 
line "I would find a way" is 
all but drowned out by dis-
torted guitar; here, Remor's 
vocals get precedence by 
changing the dreary mood 
of a voice being lost in the 
fray to a . more resolute 
statement of hope. 

Most NIN fans are pret-
ty die-hard about getting 
every recording they can; 
for the rest of us casual fans, 
"All That Could Have 
Been . Live" offers another 
set of smashed-out songs of 
i mernal rage and external 
frustration.

album 

Spyglass 
'Strategies for the 

Stranded' 
Pattern 25 Records 

**** Seattle used to be 
known for its abi lity to 
churn out alternative rock 
outfits that stormed the 
nati o n with sounds that 
emphasized the "power" in 
power chords. T he music 
scene is still strong, but 
Seattle won't be typecast in 
the music world. Bands 
such as Spyglass wi ll help 
break those molds. 

In August of 2001 the 
band released its second 
album, "Strategies for the 
Stranded," and this album 
has been met wi th critica l 
acclaim. 

The fu ll [Ones in 
Barbara Trentalanges voice 
are a powerful musical 
weapon. She can sing with 
husky tones or in pleadi ng 
cries. John Roth (guitars, 
keyboards), David Einmo 

• reviews 
(guitars), Clay Martin (bass) 
and Barry Shaw (drums) 
round ou t a crew tha t can 
play haunting Portishead-
esquc melodies or rough-
edged runes reminiscent of 
ea rl y Radiohead. 
. The somber quality of 

"Strategies for the 
Stranded," combined with 
well-placed orchestral 
crescendos, crcate sweeping 
soundscapes. Thc album is 
not overproduced wi th 
quirky electronic blips or 
overbearing strings. 

"Dimming Stars" is a 
seductive song that cap-
tures the listener with its 
guitar hooks and a key-
board lin e that wanders in 
and out. "China Doll" 
might be the cl osest no d to 
the Seattle rock of old. 
This three-minute rocker 
th rows in familiar alt-rock 
drum licks and fuzzy guitar 
chords. 

Melodic guitars, a 
steady bass guitar and 
swirling synth loops mixed 
with sultry vocals resu lt in 
a dark atmospheric album. 
Elements of Mercury Rev 
and even the " Pablo 
H oney" days of Radioh ead 
can be found in the 
Spyglass sound, but 
"Strategies for the 
S tranded" remai ns fres h 
and the a lbum flows like 
velvet.

Thievery Corp. 
Sounds from the Verve 

Hi-Fi 
Verve 

***** The Thievery 
C o rporation falls in the 
cracks somewhere 
between abstract electroni-
ca and jazz. Rob Garza and 
Eric Hilton formed the 
duo in 1996 rn 
Washington, D.C. 

Famous jazz record 
label Verve Records asked 
the grou p to select its 
favorite records from the 
Verve catalog and put the m 
on a compila tion. 

The resul t is a diverse 
selection of sharp lounge 
tunes with influences that 
range from India to Brazil. 
Stan Getz, Astrud Gilberro 
and Cal Tjader and others 
create a beautiful montage 
of sounds tha t range from 
bossa nova to music noir. 

Getz and Luiz Bonfa 
open the album with 

HIATUS II 

"Menina Flor," a di tlnc-
tively Brazilian bossa nova 
sOllnd with the gentle 
caress of the .guitar and d' t: 
trupi c al sax nowing 
through like a cool brec7e. 
Tracks Stich as " li ard 
Latin" by Kenyon Ilopkll1 ' 
continue the Latin flal'or 
scattered through out the 
album. 

Richie Havens' 
"Something El e Again" 
opens with the cascading 
notes of the sitar, which 
noodle around while the 
sounds of a flute playfully 
scamper around the back-
ground . 

Gilberto's take on The 
Doors' "Light My Fire" is 
a dark and brooding cover 
with jazzy elements that 
make this classic rock song 
a pleasant lounge tune. YOli 
can also groove to some 
more straight-ahead jazz 
with "For Mods Only" by 
Chico Hamilton. 

This is a collection of 
classic tunes compiled by 
two very modern charac-
ters who did not forget 
what in spi red their music. 

As Garza states, "Wnile 
Ii teni ng to this collection 
of music, one is able 10 
travel. thro,~gh many places 
and ulnes. 

One may also suppose 
this compilation will 
remai n timeless.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21. 2002 

Disc hosts ultimate tourney 
Over 40 teams flock to UCSD last weekend 
By TAIT MILLER 
Senior Staff Writer 

Over 25 men's and 20 women's 
teams descending on UCSD to 
compete in the largest ultimate disc 
tournament on the West Coast, the 
UCSD President's D ay 
Competition. 

Far-flung schools such as the 
University of British Columbia and 

. Harvard University journeyed to 
UCSD and threw, dove and played 
hard for three days. 

Teams started play Saturday, 
and both UCSD teams availed 
themselves well. 

The teams were split into pools 
and for the first day, the UCSD 
Squids were in a pool with UC 
Davis, the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill, the School 
of Mines from Colorado and 
Clairemonr-McKenna College. 

The first three games of the day 
went by fairly easily for the Squids. 
UCSD defeated UNC, Mines and 
Clairemonr-McKenna while play-
ing good defense and offense, 
although at alternating inten'als. 

The team's last game, against 
UC Davis, was arguably UCSD"s 
biggest win of the tournamenr. 

'Champions: 
Gwynn, Hawk and 
Washington join elite 
Continued from page 16 
gram featured [he induction of 
Washington, Hawk and Gwynn . 

Gwynn, the most notable 
inductee of the class of 2002, 
spent nearly his entire sports 
career in the San Diego area. [n 
1977, the Long Beach Poly High 
School graduate enrolled at San 
Diego State on a basketball schol-
arship . In his four years as an 
Aztec, Gwynn became the only 
SDSU player ever to cam AlI-
Western Conference honors in 
two sports, finding a home in the 
Aztec outfield when not leading 
the Aztec basketball team. 

"I came to San Diego State as a 
snot-nosed punk," Gwynn said 
during his induction speech. " Y 
improved at State because [ grew 
up." 

[n 1981 , Gwynn signed with 
the San Diego Padres and within a 
year had worked hi s way through 
the minor league system and was 
playing full ' time at Jack Murphy 
Stadium. In his 20 years as a pro-
fessional, Gwynn's career numbers 
are nothing short of staggering. 
He batted at least .300 for 19 con-
secutive seasons, winning eight 
National League batting titles. 
Gwynn retired with a career .338 
batting average totaling 3,141 

Davis was ranked No. I in its pool 
and was playing excellent frisbee 
cOIning into the tournament. 

The Squids came out fast in me 
game and built a huge early lead. 
The Aggies eventually woke up and 
made an attempt to pull out a late 
victory. They came up short and 
UCSD escaped with a one-poinr 
victory. 

"We had a huge lead which 
dwindled toward the end of the 
game," said Squid co-captain Brian 
Chen, "but we still won, taking first 
in our pool." 

The UCSD women's team also 
advanced from day one. 

Sunday proved more relaxed. 
After a couple of games had been 
played, rain inundated the fields. 
Many tearns left early. There was 
not enough playing space or time 
to make up all of the games, so 
teams that had traveled the furthest 
were given preference and local 
teams were sent packing. 

Lucas Benhke, a member of the 
UC Santa Cruz team, commented 
on the rainoUl. 

"It is really too bad that the rains 
had to come down today. The fields 
were just not able to suck up the 
water," Benhke said. "It would have 

total hits. More importantly for 
Gwynn, however, is that he led the 
Padres to their only World Series 
appearances in 1984 and 1998. 

Gwynn played his entire career 
as a Padre; something exceedingly 
rare in today's baseball world. 

When asked why, Gwynn 
responded, "The most important 
question you should answer when 
deciding where to play is not 
where you can win a title or get 
the most money, but when you 
leave the park and you're driving 
home, you should ask yourself one 
question : 'Am [ happy where I'm 
going?' My answer was always 
'yes' when living in San Diego." 

Gwynn now heads up 1-8 to 
coach the baseball team at San 
Diego State. 

"My job n.ow is to promote col-
lege baseball, not just San Diego 
State," he said. "Whether it's at 
State, USD, Point Lorna or 
UCSD, I'm here as an ambassador 
of college baseball." 

Washington is best remem-
bered for his service as the starting 
right offensive tackle for the San 
Diego Chargers .between 1970 and 
1982. 

He was instrumental in provid -
ing the protection for one for the 
most exciting National Football 
League offenses in recent history, 
a passing-heavy scheme dubbed 
"Air Coryell" after head coach 
Don Coryell. Washington played 
in perhaps the most memorable 
NFL game in history, a 41-38

AN EVENING WITH NOVELIST 
Mark Salzman 

March f. 2002 • 8 p.m . 
Carlsbad City Library at Dove Lane 

Rudy G. Schulman Auditorium 
Admission: $101$5 students & seniors 

Best-selling novelist and accomplished cellist 
Mark Salzman will read from his works and 
discuss the art of writing. TIckets are available 
at the door. For advance ticket information, call 
(760)795-6874. 

"A Yale-educated Houdini, Mark Salzman has 
made a career of locking himself inside closed 

been nice to stay around and finish 
the tournament, but it is under-
standable what UCSD had to do." 

Much of the credit for gettinll" 
through the rain delay smoothly 
goes toward tournament directors 
Chris Stotts, Jake Chang, Alicia 
White and Laurel Fiske. 

Play resumed on Monday as the 
championship pool began to play 
out. While Saturday belonged to 
the Squids with their huge upset, 
Monday belonged to the Harvard 
team. 

The UCSD men built a 9-6 lead 
in their first and only game of the 
day against Harvard. Critical men-
tal mistakes doomed the Squids and 
allowed Harvard to come back. 
Harvard emerged victorious with a 
10-9 overtime victory. 

The women had no such let-
down. They fought their way 
through the competition, making it 
all the way to the finals where they 
met up with a very strong team 
from the University of Colorado at 
Boulder. After a hard fight, UCSD 
JUSt did not have enough left and 
Colorado capitalized, taking home 
the tournament trophy. 

Colorado also won on the men's 
side, defeating Humboldt State and 

overtime victory over the Miami 
Dolphins in the 1982 AFC 
Conference semifinals, a game 
Sports Illustrated dubbed "the sin-
gle greatest team sports event in 
history." 

Hawk is the first Breitbard Hall 
of Fame inductee from one of the 
"new" breed of sports. Like the 
names mentioned above, Hawk 
dominated the skateboarding 
world for 18 years, beginning at 
the ripe age of 14. Starting with 
National Skateboard Association 
championships, then progressing 
to such mainstrea m events as the 
X-games, Hawk entered a total of 
104 professional contests, winning 
an astonishing 72 and finishing 
out of the top three only four 
times in his career. 

At tile end of his career, Hawk 
became the first skater ever to com-
plete the 900 - a two-a nd-a-hal f 
rotation spi n - in a competition 
setting at the 1999 X-games. This 
move alone provided the impetus 
for skating 's shift toward main-
stream acceptance as a sport. Now 
retired, Hawk is resting on his lau-
rels in Carlsbad, Calif. In total, 
Hawk has been credited with 
inventing 85 tricks, and his influ-
ence can be seen in a vast number 
of sports besides skateboarding, 
from inline-skating to snowboard-
ing. 

The Breitbard Hall of Fame is 
located at the San Diego Hall of 
Champions in the Federal 
Building at Balboa Park.

Crew prepares to kick off 2002 season 
Men led by Sullivan and King, women helped by strong incoming freshmen 
ByANU KUMAR 
Staff Writer 

Both men's and women's UCSD 
crew experienced success last year, 
and the two squads expect to 
improve even more during the 
upcoming season. 

Men's varsity crew competed in 
Division I and proved that it 
belonged in competition against 
spons-scholarship schools. UCSD 
fillished in third place last ye,ar, 
only placing behind only UC 
Berkeley and University of 
Washington. 

This year, crew is led by senior 
varsity member Brian Sullivan and 
junior varsity member Yukio King. 
Both Tritons are experienced and 
have been a part of strong tearns in 

. the past. The leadership of Sullivan 
and King will be important to 
UCSD's success this season. 

Stoner: 
Get rid of Olympic 
events no one watches 
continued from page 16 
letes?" I don't care about nordic 
combined or short track skating. I 
... don't ... care. 

Well, there is one exception. 
Irina Slutskaya, I sincerely wish I 
knew you and that you were a 
friend of mine so I could call you 
"Slut" for short. 

But seriously, my point is 
nobody cares about these events; 
few Americans even know what the 
hell they are. I'll admit it. I had to 
look up what the skeleton is, and I 
know you would too. Where did 
these events come from? Why 
include these random competitions 
when nobody watches them or even 
cares about them? 

I think the Olympic committee 
members should take a few minutes 
from stuffing their pockets with 
·money and terminate these events. 
Incorporate some new, exciting 
things that people might actually 
want to see. All right, maybe that's 
unrealistic, but nobody is ever 
going to watch the Olympics 
besides all the men who like to ogle 

Men's crew head coach Michael 
Filippone likes how the 2002 
Tritons look. 

"We have a large group of 
promising returning athletes that 
will make this year's team strong. 
We have been working very hard," 
he said. "Our goal is to win the 
Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association ChampioI'ships and the 
Pac-1O Rowing Championships." 

On the women's side of the 
water, the Triton lightweights fin-
ished ranked seventh in the coun-
try last year, while the heavy-
weights were ranked 21 st. 

Head coach Pattie Pinkerton is 
excited about her young novice 
team this year and said that UCSD 
has several "excellent" walk-ons. 
These incoming members are 
headed up by freshmen Amanda 
Milligan and Amber Martin, who 
are just two of several young 

the figure skaters. 
Seriously though, how about 

including ice climbing? I don't 
know about everyone else, but I 
would rather watch people crawl up 
sheer walls of ice than ski across the 
country for hours. 

Every year in Canada, there is a 
"Sky to Sea" competition, which 
includes skiing, mountain biking, 
running and kayaking into one big 
race. Half the tearns never even fin-
ish. Now that's a real competition, 
and I guarantee it would draw a 
bigger audience than the Nordic 
Combined. 

Now for all the guys I previous-
ly mentioned who like to watch fig-
ure skating "because it's really a 
beautiful form of art," relax. I'm 
not saying we should get rid of fig-
ure skating or speed skating, or any 
of the other exciting events. I'm 
just saying there needs to be some-
thing to fill the early morning tele-
vision spot besides boring old curl-
ing. 

Until something is done about 
these, these, these ... things that 
can't even be called sports, people 
will not be interested in the 
periphery of the Winter 
Olympics . But hey, there's always 
"BattleBots" to keep me enter-
tained.

women that Pinkerton will look to 
lead the Triton novice squad. 

Pinkerton said she has a few 
goals that she would like her team 
to meet this year. 

"Technique is really critical in 
the sport of rowing," she said. "We 
are going to try to improve our 
technique, depth and endurance 
this season." 

Looking ahead at tile schedule, 
the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Rowing Championships 
are already highlighted, which will 
take place in May. Each region will 
send one team to the meet, and 
UCSD, competing in the western 
region, is up against tough competi-
tion. The Tritons are looking at UC 
Davis and Western Washington as 
key opponents in their region. 

"We are certainly a team in the 
top 10," said Pinkerton. "We have 
high hopes for this season." 

Tennis: 
Tritons now 7-0 overall,

score to 3-4 before Sunday'S post-
ponement. On Monday, Davis 
pushed the match to 5-6 before 
the UCSD pair won the next 
three games, breaking on two of 
them to take the victory. 

"It may sound cliched, but [the 
Tritons) played the bigger points 
better than we did," Aggie coach 
Bill Maze said of the doubles 
matches. "Any time you come out 
of doubles with two wins, you're 
in a good posi tion." 

The momentum gained when 
the doubles matches carried over 
into the singles matches and pro-
pelled the Tritons to victory. 

O'Neil cruised to a 6-2, 6-0 vic-
tory over Ali-Christie in No.2 sin-
gles. With that win and Tadlock's 
victory, the Tritons needed only 
one more match to win the contest 
with three matches still undecided

(Dao lost to Howard 1-6,2-6). 
With lansen and Hung both 

losing theIr first sets, all eyes turned 
to Westerman and her match 
against Mok. Westerman easily 
took the first set 6-0. In the second 
set, Mok came out strong, breaking 
serve and jumping out to a 4-1 lead. 

"At that point, I knew all I had 
to do was return serve and keep 
the ball in," Westerman said. "In 
the first set, she commitred a lot 
of errors." 

Westerman's strategy worked 
because she won the next five 
games, breaking serve three times 
to pull out the 6-0, 6-4 victory and 
give the win to the Tritons. 

The: Aggies needed to leave for 
another schedule match, so 
Jansen's and Hung's matches were 
suspended after the first sets with 
the victory already secure. 

"1 t was a big win for the team, " 
Tadlock said. "Most of the girls on 
the team are sophomores, so they 
weren't around for oUT last victory 
against Davis [in the 2000 season). 
I'm one of the few who was, so 
this makes it a little more special." 

UCSD opened the weekend 
with a 9-0 sweep of Sonoma State 
University on Saturday afternoon. 

Using the same lineup as they 
did in the UC Davis match, the 
Tritons swept past Sonoma with 
few problems. '''esterman and 
Tadlock combined to beat their 
doubles opponent 8-2 before win-
ning their singles matches 6-0, 6-
o and 6-1, 6-1, respectively. 

UC Davis and UCSD are 
favored to win the CCM. 
UCSD's victory puts it in position 
to win the regular-season title. 

The Tritons are now 7-0 with a 
4-0 mark in CCM play. The 
Aggies dropped to 4-4 with a 3- 1 
record in the CCAA. 

"We've been gearing up for the 
match all season," said Triton head 
coach Liz LaPlante. "We are so 
evenly matched so we knew it 
would come down to who wanted it 
more, and today we wanted to win." 

The UCSD women 's team 
returns to action next weekend, 
traveling to face Cal State 
Bakersfield on Saturday.

SO's best: From left to r i gh~ professional skateboarder Tony Hawk (with his son) accepts his nomination to the San Diego Hall of Champion; former Padre Tony 
Gwynn, a graduate of San Diego State University, gives his acceptance speech last week at the San Diego Sports Arena. 

UCSD's Kristin Jones among those honored at Hall of Champions 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The San Diego sports world 
honored three of its greatest last 
Wednesday by inducting Tony 
Gwynn, Russ Washington and 
Tony Hawk into the Breitbard 
Hall of Fame, part of the San 
Diego Hall of Champions. 

The San Diego Sports Arena 
was the s ite of the 56th annual 
Salute to Champions, with the 
inductions headlining the event. 

While the night belonged to 
the three hall of fame inductees, 
the San Diego Hall of 
Champions program began by 
honoring the San Diego area 
amateur and professional players 
of the month. The Hall recog-
nizes five to six high-school play-
ers and six to 10 college/profes-
sional athletes each month, while 
recognizing all recipients at this 
banquet. 

Notable recipients included 
the Padres' Phil Nevin and 
Trevor Hoffman, the Chargers' 

LaDanian Tomlinson, and the 
San Diego Spirit's Shannon 
Macmillan. 

Kristin Jones, a starting for-
ward on UCSD's Division II 
national champion soccer team, 
was one of eight players of the 
month for December. Jones led 
the Triton attack through the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Final Four in the 
process of picking up UCSD's 
third consecutive NCAA champi-
onship. Jones was named most 
valuable offensive player of the 
tournament, only scoring one 
goal but dictating the flow of the 
play in the attacking third . 

The ceremony, with La Jolla 
native and CBS broadcaster Dick 
Enberg serving as master of cere-
monies, continued by honoring 
Melanie Benn as disabledathlete 
of the year. 

In 1995, Benn was stricken 
with bacterial meningitis, which 
resulted in quadruple amputation 
of both arms and legs. Fully 
recovered in 1997, Benn received 

her inspiration to compete after 
watching a challenged-athletes 
triathlon . Within a year, Benn 
was competing in triathlons 
before focusing on her swimming 
career. Her hard work culminat-
ed in a silver medal at the Sydney 
Paraiympics. 

College athletes Spencer 
Wright and Mark Prior received 
the award for amateur starts of 
the year. 

Wright, a Serra High School 
graduate, starred in lacrosse at 
Syracuse University, leading the 
Orangemen to a second-place 
finish in the NCAA tournament. 
In a sport traditionally dominat-
ed by East Coast players, 
Wright'S presence served as a 
wake-up call to the nation that 
the West Coast, and particularly 
San Diego, is a breeding ground 
for good players. 

Prior was the most honored 
collegiate player in any sport in 
2001 after helping the University 
of Southern California to its 21st 
appearance in the College 

Baseball World Series. Prior was 
the most dominant pitcher in the 
nation, finishing the season with 
a 15-1 record and a 1.69 ERA. 

Prior was honored by Baseball 
America, which said he "may be 
the best college pitcher ever." A 
graduate of University of San 
Diego High chool, he was the 
second overall pick in June 's draft 
by the Chicago Cubs. 

San Diego Padres Trevor 
Hoffman and Phil Nevin were 
honored by the Hall of 
Champions as Professional 
Athletes of the Year. Hoffman has 
the best save percentage among 

• all current major-league closers. 
He amazingly blew only three 
chances on his way to picking up 
43 saves last season. 

Nevin was the heart of the 
Padres lineup in 200 I, belting 41 
home runs and picking up 126 
runs batted in.

Women's tennis beats UC Davis 
UCSD triumphs over the Aggies for the first time in two years 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

For the first time since 2000, the 
UCSD womens tennis team defeat-
ed rival UC Davis 5-2 on Monday at 
UCSDs North Campus Courn. 

Rain postponed the match 's 
start from noon Sunday until 3 
p.m. Three doubles matches were 
played before rain moved in again 
and forced postponement until 
Monday morning. 

The Tritons ' lone senior, 
Lyndsey Tadlock, who is No. 11 in 
the latest Intercollegiate Tennis 

Association rankings, led UCSD 
to its impressive victory. 

She first teamed with Julie 
Westerman in No. I doubles to 
defeat the Aggies' A1isse Ali-
Christie and Gretchen Schantz 8-
5. In singles action, Tadlock easily 
disposed of Britni Webb 6-1, 6-0. 

That match was Tadlock's first 
win over Webb. Tadlock lost to 
Webb twice in the 2001 season, 
once in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play and again 
in the CCAA tournament. 

"She's a really streaky player," 
Tadlock said of Webb. "Today she 

just wasn't in i.t." 
In doubles, Tadlock and 

Westennans match was suspended 
Sunday afternoon with the teams 
even at 4-4. The Triton duo came 
out with a renewed vigor Monday, 
breaking the Aggie serve in the 12th 
game to push the score to 7-5 before 
finishing them off in the 13th. 

"We knew we had to come out 
strong after the break," Tadlock 
said. "We served well both days 
and knew we just needed to break 
once and we would take it." 

In the other doubles matches, 
UCSD's Mary Hung and Ashley 

O'Neil fell to Aggies Jill Howard 
and Webb 4-8 with the match 
postponed at 3-5 on Sunday. The 
Davis duo broke serve in Monday'S 
first game to push the score to 3-6, 
cementing their path to victory. 

. In the best comeback of the 
match, the No.3 doubles team of 
Jasmin Dao and Kristina Jansen 
defeated UC Davis ' Janice 
Salomon and Nancy Mok 8-6. 
The Aggie team opened the match 
to win the first four games, but the 
Tritons responded by pushing the
