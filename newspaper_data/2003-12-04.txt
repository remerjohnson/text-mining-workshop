Contract reached 
between TAs, UC 

Strike averted one day 
before scheduled start 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

A major strike was averted 
when the University of California 
announced late on Dec. 2 that 
they had reached a ten tative 
agreement with the United Auto 
Workers union, which represents 
over 11 ,000 teaching assistants 
and o ther academic student 
employees systemwide. 

Earlier in the day, the union 
had announced that its members 
would strike on Dec. 4, just days 
before the start of fi nals week, in 
hopes of pressuring the university 

to preserve the union's right to 
sympathy strikes in its new con-
tract. 

Union members will vote on 
the agreement this week. If the 
union fails to ratify the agree-
ment, which takes a majority to 
pass, UAW would have to return 
to the bargaining table with the 
university. 

Both the U niversity of 
Californ ia and UAW have with-
held all information regarding 
the agreement, pending the rat-
ification of the agreement.

as the 12th president of the UC 
system from 1958 to 1967, died at 
his EI Cerrito, Calif., home due to 
complications from a fall, accord-
ing to a UC Berkeley press release. 

During Kerr' presidency, the 
University of California saw 
unprecedented growth with the 
college years of the baby boom 
generation. Enrollment rose from 
43,000 to 87,000 students. Three 
new campuses - UCSD, UC 
Irvine and UC Santa Cruz - were 
opened under his care. 

"The same vision that shaped 
Californ ia's Master Plan for 
H igher Education, shaped this 
cam pus," Acting Chancellor 
Marsha A. C handler said. "Clark 
Kerr's imprint can be seen in the 
uniqueness of our undergraduate 
colleges, our tradition of recruit-

ing the highest quality faculty, 
and the remarkable catalog of 
UCSD's achievement in only four 
decades ... UCSD is fortunate to 
be a part of his legacy." 

Kerr was the main architect and 
negotiator for the state's Ma ter 
Plan, which shaped the university'S 
commitment to accessibility as well 
as its relationship to the state uni-
versity and community college sys-
tems. 

Under the plan, and to this day, 
the top 12 .5 percent of high 
school students are guaranteed a 
place at a UC campus, the top 
one-thi rd a spot at a California 
State University campus and all 
high school graduates access to 
community college.

Academic Senate approves 
change to grading policy 
The Academic Senate voted on an 

amendment to grading policies that will 
include all grades from repeated courses in 
the grade point average of students who 
have been found guilty of academic dishon-
esty. 

w'en a student fails a course for other rea-
sons, the grade obtained for repeating a 
course will still replace the original grade in the 
calculation of the transcript's grade point aver-
age. 

For those charged with academic dishon-
esty, however, both the onginal grade for the 
course and the new grade for the repeated 
course will be calculated.

"The bargaining team is pleased and it's

UCOP officials would not comment on 
the agreement.

"The negotiations had been ongoing and 
we were more hopeful yesterday and things

change in their behavior." 

Many srudents felt relieved that their 
TAs would be available to aid them before

H[ wasn't looking forward to a strike

Averted strike is good 
for undergraduates 

U nited Auto Workers, the union that repre-
sents teaching assis-

tants, readers and tutors, 
wa prepared to call a strike 
on Dec. 4 that could have 
extended into finals . 
Thankfully, cooler heads 
prevailed and a strike was 
averted. 

The TAs want the right to 
"sympathy soikes" - soikes 
by the TA union in support 
of other unionized employ-
ee. ympathy strikes are 
important to unions, e pe-
cially smaller ones for whom 
"strength in numbers" is 
neces ary to remain rele-
vant. It i under tandable 
that the union would eek to 
keep trus right. 

Avoiding a trike is sig-
nificant in two ways. The 
fact that no strike i neces-
sary means that the TAs 
feel more comfortable 
with their bargaining siru-
ation. More tmportantly, 
tud ents will not feel the 

brunt of their TAs' dissat-

i faction with their 
employers. triking during 
finals week would have 
hurt the students more 
than the university; any-
thing that keeps the TAs 
doing their job during 
finals week i cause for 
thanks. 

Despite the ab ence of 
an immediate strike threat, 
undergraduates should still 
pay attention to these kinds 
of labor di putes in the 
future . Srudent who 
sought information in the 
past couple of weeks should 
continue learning about 
these issues as they 
reemerge throughout their 
academIC expenence. This 
is not a "one-time deal" -
labor disputes between 
campus employee and the 
univer ity will again occur 
in the furure and strike po -
sibili ties will continue to 
surface. tudents should be 
prepared, and the be t way 
to do that i by paying 
attention. 

Gov. Schwarzenegger's 
budget cuts drastic 

W ithin the first month of his term, Gov. Arnold 
chwarzenegger has pro-

posed $100 million in CUts 
to the University of 
California for the current 
academic year as part of his 
, J.9 billion budget reduc-
tion package. 

Although attempts cer-
tainly must be made to lower 
California's $8 billion bud-
get deficit, taking money 
fr m an institution that has 
already cen monetary sup-
port repeatedly withdrawn 
over the pa t year is surely 
not the solution. 

The proposal would 
include cutting $24.7 mil-
lion in state fUnding t the 
UC utreach Program, 
effective Jan . 1; withdrawing 
$2 million in funding for 
labor ~tudies for the remain-
der 0 the academic year and 

1 .4 mjllion in unallocated 
cuts; and transferring 55 
million of revenue from 
land ales at C River ide 

from the U budget to the 
state general fund. 

The e cuts are unaccept-
able. Srudents have seen 
their fees rise three times 
in the past year. The budget 
for the University of 
California was cut by $654 
mil/ion, with student fee 
increa es offsetting $230 
million of the 10 s. 

Thi proposed cut runs 
counter to a significant yart 
of the governor's platform 

regardin~ education. 
Effecnvely eliminating 

the UC utreach program 
will cripple an institution 
devoted to generating the 
very kinds of opporrunities 
that he has championed. 

Schwarzenegger' 
Propo ition 49 aimed to 
keep kid off the streets. 
The U utreach 
Program ha :.i milar goals 
directed toward a simi lar 
age group. If thI S proposal 
passes, chwarzen egger 

ill be anacking the very 
group he sought to help.

Napster back in news, lAs ready to strike Letters: 
FMLA seeks 

fair treatment 
from council 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

N apster is back in the news again. As one of the first universities that banned 
the original apster from its dorm 
network, the news seems at least a 
bit UCSD related. Although it has 
been a couple years since this 
writer has run around the dorms as 
a freshman, no doubt piracy is still 
quite rampant. The computer 
variety, not the rum and booty 
kind, although the latter probably 
happens quite a bit as well . 

This time, however, Napster 
is legal (because you actually have 
to pay for songs), and at least one 
university appears to be happy to 
work with it. Penn State 
University has signed an agree-
ment with Napster to provide 
free music from Napster's collec-
tion of thousands of songs for 
students in the dorms, so long as 
they're streaming the music 
instead of downloading it. If they 
want a copy for their MP3 player 
or laptop, they will need to pay 
99 cents to download it perma-
nently, albeit with copyright 
re triction . 

One wonders whether UCSD 
would benefit from such an 
arrangement. orne would 
undoubtedly object to the use of 
student fees towards the cause of 
free mu ic for all, but it would 
surely be a much more palatable 
use of student funds then say, 
funding A.S salaries, the College 
Republicans, or any number of 
S.O.L.O. organizations. While 

funding free music for students 
in the residential halls (and by 
proxy server for students off 
campus) might not do much to 
stimulate students to leave their 
dorm rooms. It might actually 
take some upload stress off the 

campus networks si nce all the 
freshmen will not be uploading 
songs for hours a day while the 
file-sharing clients lie open on 
their computers, making the con-
nections faster for everyone. If 
we can justify spending student 
fees on 'entertainment' that con-
sists of concerts and athletic 
events, why not spend it on a 
resource just about everyone can 
appreciate? 

T he teaching assistants are going to trike in order to secure the right to strike -
for other people. Is this writer the 
only one who finds this proposi-
tion at least a bit ludicrous? Now, 
while this writer is all for labor 
agitation in the name of funda-
mental human rights, the right to 
strike for other people does not 
really strike as any sort of necessi-
ty on par with a living wage, 
affordable health care, or decent 
working conditions. 

The timing is no doubt quite a 
piece of strategy. But all things 
considered, calling a strike during 
finals week over other people's 
strikes is akin to orth Korea 
dropping their one atom bomb on 
Arizona . Sure, it stings, but it 
does not accomplish much of any-
thing for having used the trump 
card. 

This writer has almost always 
found going to discussion section 
to be more of a nuisance than a 
guidance of any sort. As far as ped-
agogy is concerned, it always 

seems that people learn more 
when they are forced to muddle 
through the homework themselves 
without guidance, although it may 
take several hours more. 

The entire educational estab-
Ii hment would disagree with me, 
but most every section this writer 
has been to (at least in the sciences 
and engineering) has been a glori-
fied answer section that leaves lit-
tle to hard work or imagination. 
This may not be as true in litera-
ture or history lower division 
classes, where the purpose of sec-
tions is to instigate discussion and 
critical thought about the subject 
at hand, but in my experience, lit-
tle of this happens either. Perhaps 
we would be more worried about 
the impending prospect of a strike 
if there were actually a line at any 
professor's door during office 
hours. As it stands, the whole of 
the student popula tion a ppears to 
either be competent enough or 
apathetic enough about their edu-
cation that any learning beyond 
the answers to homework ques-
tions is hardly sought after. 

In any case, the entire ques-
tion of a strike might very well be 
moot for those in the sciences 
and engineering, since those grad 
srudents are (relatively) well -off 
with prospects of research assist-
antships in a lab a year or two in 
the future . Last time there was a 
major strike in the late 1990's, the 
science and engineering TAs 
seem inclined to participate in 
the strike only out of sympathy 
(and fittingl y enough, that's what 
the entire current strike is about), 
since their material well-being is 
somewhat secure. Those unhap-
py souls (literature grad students, 
for example, or theoretical physi-
cists) for whom working for the 
univer ity (and god forbid, serv-

ing students) is their sentence in 
exchange for indulging in an aca-
demic field that our commerce-
centered society refuses to subsi-
dize may very well strike. Save 
for unfortunate math TAs (who 
are engaged in something just as 
numerically difficult and much 
less rewarded), the TAs who give 
answers to homework may prob-
ably be around for finals . The 
question does remain as to who 
will grade all those finals, 
although professors have been 
known to pick up a pen from time 
to time. 

As the quality of this column 
might attest, education in writing 
is already understaffed and over-
worked at just about any universi-
ty. Perhaps those TAs who try to 
impress upon the masses of biolo-
gy and engineering majors that 
good writing abilities are worth 
something should be compensated 
better than they are. But that is 
not the point in question. 

The point in question is 
whether university unions should 
have monopoly power, by control-
ling all realms of university indus-
try by the power of the strike. This 
writer is not for a monopoly in any 
arena - be it software or fossil 
fuels or labor, because the conse-
quences are the same - reduced 
efficiency and higher prices for the 
consumers, namely students. For 
all their talk of public service, 
striking in order to make public 
service in the future worse while 
appealing to their position as pub-
lic servants does little [Q garner 
sympathy from this corner. 

This column stands for egalitarian pnn-
ciples. All correspondence sent to 
e2wu@ucsd.edu will be treated with an 
equal amount of incompetence.

6 OPINION THE U 0 GUARDIAN THUR DAY, DECEMBER 4, 2001 

Speaker set in the midst of campus tension, rises to 
occasion with thoughtful perspectives of hope 

By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

\\'hen DePaul Umverslt) polit-
Ical cience professor ~orman 
Finkelstein approached the podium 
in Pn e Center Ballroom on , 0\'. 

~5, he looked around the room and 
laughed a linJe nervousl). "There' 
an onunous quiet here wruch eems 
unwarramed," he said. 

It wa qUite hushed, despite the 
'ize of the crowd. But the uneasy 
silence in the room wa under-
tandable: Finkelstein was about to 

give a lecture titled "Palestine and 
Israel : Roots of Conflict, Pro pects 
for Peace." 

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
has a rustory of acti\,ism around it 
and has always been one of the 
few issues that an shake the 
UC 0 community from its usual 
i ndi fference to politics. In 
February 2001, the Muslim 
Student Association-sponsored 
"Antl-ZlOmsm Week" turned the 
campus on It head, sparklng 
enlightening debate and di\~ ive 
bitterness between UC D's 
respective supporters of Israelis 
and Palestinians. Last year, a 
eries of lectures on both side of 

the issue wa attended and 
protested by dl enters, and flyers 
for both MSA and the Union of 
Jewish Student were defaced or 
torn down. 

Finkelstein walked into a pow-
der keg, and ffilght have been the 
spark to igrute it. He has authored 
several concroversial books about 
the J lolocaust and the Israeli-
Palesoruan conflict, and some label 
him ano- emioc. 

In the weeks before his lecture 
here, the an Diego Israel Alliance 

Circulated an e-mail on UCSD II t-
en'S, reading "M,r. Finkelstein's 

visit is of great concern to member 
of [ DIA] as well as the UCSD 
JeWish community at large ... \\'e 
remall1 concerned about the nse of 
anti- emltlsm on the C 0 cam-
pus as well a worldwide, and for 
this rea on, we felt it necessary to 
alert campu organiz.1tion of Mr. 
Finkel tein's visit and how it may 
affect Jewish students, as well as 
others." 

To the credit of everyone 
attending, the fireworks were kept 
to a minimum. Finkelstein's speech, 
wrule charged, was far from violent 
polemic, and those in the audience 
who disagreed with him were 
respectful and a ked cordial ques-
tion during the question-and-
answer period after the lecture. But 
what of thi charge that 
Finkel tein, a Jew himself, is anti-

emitic? It certainly found no sup-
port in his pre entation. 

Those who call Finkelstein 
ano- emitic often ground meir 
tance in hi book "The 

Holocaust Industry: Reflection 
on the Exploitation of Jewl h 
Suffering," There, he argues mat 
prominent Jews have inflated and 
exploited the Holocau t for mon-
etary and political gain. Hi critics 
say he is simply promoting me 
age-old Jewish conspiracy theory, 
which imagine the fictional 
Zioni t Council of Elders plotting 
for world domination. "The 
Holocaust lndu try" has been 
fa\'orably received by extreme 
right-wing anti- emites, but also 
by leading Holocau t hi torian 
Raul Hilberg, A work garners 
approval from bigots doesn't make 
its author bigoted . 

But the meat of the criticism of 
Finkelstein come from his mnce 
on the I raeli-Palestiman confliCt. 
lIe deplore hrael 's creatment of 
the Palestinians, likening it to 

merican conquest of the \Vest and 
the ati\'e Americans, and to 
apartheid South Africa , These 
comparisons are disturbing -
they're intended to be - and don't 
win him any Zionist friend. Some 
of those Zionists go as far as to call 
Finkelstein's stance against Israel 
anti- emitic. 

For those to whom Zionism is 

" Far those to whom 
Zionism is an essential 
component of Judaism, 

anti~ Zionism and 
anti,Semitism are one 

and the same." 
an essential component of Judaism, 
anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism 
are one and the ame. Zionists 
often quote Martin Luther King, 
Jr., who wrote, "\Vhen people crit-
icize Zioni m, they mean Jew -
make no mistake about it." This 
ignore the many Jew who are 
them elves anti-Zioni t, from 
American liberal like Finkel tein 
to ulcra-orthodox Israeli Jews who 
believe only God can e tablish a 
Jewish kingdom on earth . 

Further, the re pective defini-
tions of "Zioni m OO and "anti-
Zionism" are up for grabs. Is 
Zionism the belief in the principle

of the existence of ;l Jewish home-
land in historical Palestine? Is it 
wlconclitional uppon for the state 
of Israel as it currently exists? And 
can "anti-Zioni tOO be applied to 
anyone that cnticize ' Israel's poli -
cies, or is it reserved only for those 
who call for the descruction of the 
state itself? 

Finkelstein' position amid all 
this is unclear. His umempered 
criticism of the creation of the 
state of Israel suggests he would 
rather it never have come into 
existence, but when pressed to 
offer a solution to the current 
conflict, he argues for a [wo-state 
settlement the likes of which has 
been offered up again and again 
since the I 940s. owhere does 
Finkelstein suggest the destruc-
ti on of I srae!' 

either is he an apologist for 
the Palestinians. He frequently 
call the Palestinian leadership 
corrupt and inept. While he Illay 
minimize Palestinian violence 
against Israelis, making little men-
tion in his lecture of their part in 
keeping the cycle of violence mov-
ing, he is no defender of suicide 
bombings . 

\-\Then one audience member 
a ked him if suicide bombings 
weren't mislabeled "terrorism" 
because the Palestinians have no 
other means by which to resist, 
Finkelstein rejected this old justi-
fication. "It's wrong," he said 
plainly. UEveryon: know~, it's 
wrong, You know It S wrong, 

Rather than crying to excuse 
the morally inexcusable, 
Finkel tein depicts Israel as even 
m01't morally bankrupt, inflicting 
more civilian casualties than the 
Palestinians and being accused of 

human rights violations by 
Amnesty T nrernationa!' 

"Anti-Zionist" is an appropriate 
label for Finkelstein, but anti-

emitic is not. When he decries the 
actions of tile early Zionist leader-
ship and the current 1 raeli govern-
ment, he does so on political bases, 
not religious ones. 

And as much as Zionists 
attempt to paint Zionism as an 
integral part of Judaism, Judaism 
is not theirs to define; it is a world 
religion with stunning and beauti-
ful variety within it, not subject to 
one group's limitations and 
caveats. 

This is what's behind much of 
contemporary anti-Semitism, 
Finkelstein argued. Arab antago-
nism toward I rael is not based on 
anti-Semiti m, he said, but rather 
that Arab anti- cmitism is an out-
growm of Israeli mistreatment of 
Palestinians and the conflation of 
two separate identities. "Is it any 
surprise that if all the Jews one 
meets are Zioni tS, that one begins 
to confu.se Zioni m with Judaism'" 
he asked. 

The way to reduce world and 
Arab anti-Semitism, according to 
Finkelstein, was to embrace the 
variety of opinion within the 
Jewish community with regards to 
the Israeli-Palestinian connict, to 
separate the political from the reli-
gious. 

That makes good sense, and 
could lessen the alarmingly wide-
pread hatred of Jews present in 

the world today. It could lead to 
better relations between the 
Israeli and Palestinian camp, and 
perhaps an eventual peaceful solu -
tion to one of the 20th century's 
most compelling conflicts .

onnection executive director 

Kimmy Chela said. " Last year the 
students had donated enough toys 
for the hospital to continue giving 
them out for a whole year. I'm 
hoping that we will get an equal, if 
not greater, turnout this year." 

However, Chela sa id this could 
be a difficult goal due to the timing 
of the drive. 

"We're right in Ihe middle of 
finals, but I hope the students 
remember to donate," she said. 

Individual colleges will host 
their own movie nights in order to 
collect donations for various char-
ities. 

Muir Residential Council will 
host a "Donate and a Movie" 
night o n Dec . 4 at 8 p.m, Revelle

at p .m. 

Spirit at ERC! and Community 
Outreach 'ffort, student organiza-
tions at Eleanor Roosevelt College, 
will hold a Canned Film Fe tival 
on Dec. 2, sponsor a free barbecue 
and playa free movie, "Pirates of

rganizers suggest that stu-
denrs attending the festival bring a 
donation. Suggestions include new 
toys, clothes, canned goods or 
money.

En enada for underpriviledged 
families that cannot afford health 
care, 

According to Meghan Garvey, 
who serves as AJpha Epsilon Delta's 
project co-coordinator, a nurse at 
the clinic in Ensenada asked Alpha 
Epsi lon Delta if they could get toys 
donated for the children in the 
clinic that she knew would not be 
able to afford Christmas presents. 

Alpha Epsilon Delta member 
Shrey Purohit, a Thurgood 
Marhall ollege fre hman, came 
up with the idea and plans to dress 
up as Santa Claus when the toys 
are delivered to the children . 

"We hope to make this an 
annual Alpha Epsilon Delta 
event," Garvey !>'lid. "We are just 
hoping to gath(;r any items we 
could wrap up and give to mese 
families that won't be getting any-
thing for Chriscrnas," 

Other organizations will be 
adopting families for the holidays 
through the Volunteer 
Connection, 

For the Thanksgiving season, 
the UC 0 community adopted 
over 40 families, presenting them 
with a Thanksgiving dinner they 
would otherwise not have been 
able to afford. 

The Volunteer Connection 
hopes to see a similar turnout for 
the Christmas season. 

"The Volunteer Connection has 
a whole package of volunteer 
opportunities for students celebrat-
ing Kwanzaa, Christmas and 
[Ianukkah," Marx said. "Students 
can go to their office [on the third 
floor of Price Center] and check 
out the volunteer events going on 
off-campus. "

During the forum, audience

Bruce Hamlett from the office 
of Assemblywoman arcl Liu (0-
Pasadena), who i a member of the 
Higher Education Committee, 
mentioned po sible solutions that 
the committee is looking at. 
Proposals include moving students 
mrough programs more effective-
ly, reducing per s tudent costs, uti-
lizing the private secto r and 
increasing student fees along with 
increasing financial aid. 

"These are ways to work around 
the edge to improve operations to 
cry and direct money more effec-
tively, but it's not a replacement for 
the budget deficit," Hamlett said. 

According to the experts, 
California's problell1s began during 
the economic boom in the mid-
I 990s. During this time, the state 
was able to expand many programs 
with money flowing in ftom a 
booming economy. 

L Iowever, once the boom 
ended, politicians were unable to 
deCide on a speCIfic reform to com-
bat the effects. ome of the panel 
members al 0 noted that part of 

the problem is the unwillingness of 
alifornians to make sacrifices and 

pay more taxes. 
"1 have not seen anyone in 

alifornia willing to sacrifice, and 
the problem is not just with politi-
cians," UC Berkeley professor of 
public policy John Ellwood said. 
" \\'e want that excra 10 billion a 
year without paying for it, and until 
people are willing to sacrifice their 
careers or until we are willing to 
change our mind, wc've got big 
problems." 

Dynes noted that wrule there 
are yet to be concrete solutions 
that would ultimately solve the 
budget problems, he and the lead-
ers of the California tate 
University and California 
Community College system will 
continue discu sion to find ways of 
as isting students. 

"vVe're looking at a range of 
things including better articulation 
among t the three sy tem to join 
outreach programs, better map-
ping out pathways for all high 
school t\ldcnts through rhis con-
fusing array of rugher education," 
Dynes aid.

AIDS: Speakers share personal experiences of 
living with HI\!, urged students to use caution

help do that." 

Quilts from the National 
Quilts and Names Project were 
di played at Price Center 
Ballroom for students to view. 
The majority of the pieced quilts 
were con tributions made from 
families and friends who have lost 
loved ones to AIDS . 

"I think the quilt is really 
important. It's a symbol of the 
AIDS epidemic, and it really is a 
weaving together of people's lives." 
A.S. Commis ioner of Diversity 
Mfairs and event volunteer 
Stephanie Aguon said. "That's what 
AIDS does, it touches so many peo-
ple from different backgrounds no 
matter what color or what age. It's 
an epidemic that hit so many differ-
ent communities, and it's really 
poignant to see all these pieces pUt 
together." 

SHA Co-President Chris Wong 
noted that the quilts were created 
to pay tribute to tho e who died of 
AIDS. A Prevention Quilt was 
pieced together last year by the six 
UCSD colleges. 

"It's basically just to get the 
word out and get more people 
involved," Wong said.

"What 1 say to students is never 
give up on goals or yourself no 
matter what the challenge is," 
Brown said. "I'm very glad that I 
hung in there and finished my 
degree. It would have been very 
easy for me to give in to the di ease 
and think I was going to die." 

Brown reflected on her infec-
tion as a growth experience. 

"What I have found alit with 
myself with the process of the dis-
ease is that I'm a very determined 
person," she said. "With my deter-
mination, I didn't give up my hopes 
and dreams. I didn't want to give 
AIDS any more power." 

Brown urged student.< to prac-
tice afe sex. 

"Don't expect your partner to 
take care of you, it's your job to take 
care of what happens to you," she 
said. "If you have unprotected sex, 
do you trust your parmer with your 
life? That's what it comes down to, 
because a lot of people don't know 
they're infected." 

SHA Co-President Stephanie 
C havez said she felt students at 
UCSD ignore the issue. 

"The scary thing about AIDS is 
that everyone thinks that it's some-
where else, out of our college cam-
pus," Chavez said. "People just 
don't talk about it, and that's why 
the peakers are so good because 
they can make students realize that 
it can happen to anybody." 

Event sponsors hoped that 
increa ing awareness of the conse-
quences of unprotected sex would 
encourage srudents to make good 
decisions. 

"There are a lot of collegc stu-
dents who are having unprotected 
sex and it hasn't been as much of a 
focus as it should be," Wong said . 

The event ponsors also high-
lighted the free and confidential 
IllY tests ffered through Snldent 
Health Center. 

AIDS aW!lreness evellls on cam-
pus continued throughout the

10 HIATU THE U 0 GUARDIAN TI~URSDAY, DECEMBER 4, 200] 

\\That: The computer-generated effect -
laden epic trilogy to end all computer-gener-
ated effects-laden epic trilogies ends with a 
massive bang, effectivel)' closing the story of 
some medieval stuff. Everybody who is plan-
nlllg to anend the 1l1Idl1lght premiere of this 
film in a hobbit co~tume of their own design, 
raIse your hands. Now, evcrybod}' who is still 
a \;rgin, keep your hands up. Yeah, that's 
what I thought. 

The Good: ,\lassl\'e battles and neaw 
Imagery. Thi include the completely com-
puter-generated character of Gollum, who 
hould be put in a steel- age death match 
\\~th Jar Jar Binks, another rna sive trilogy's 
computer generated character. 

The Bad: The trailer hows a giant, ary 
plder. Thl would be impres Ive, except that 

the giant spIder III the last "Harry Potter" 
movie \Va scarier. 

The Verdict: This film will most likely 
follow the trend of the previous two by 
offering nice cardboard character pin-ups 
and a story that paces itself like a hyperactive 
lap dog with narcolepsy. Recommended for 
those who like their films like their crayons: 
long and pointless. 

What: Tom Cruise plays a white man 
whose job IS to modernize some Japanese 
armies with guns, but is then captured by his 
samurai enemies. ormally thi is a bad 
thing, but our buddy Cruise decides he 
wants to become a amural because he' 
unpressed by the honor code. 

The Good: "The Last amurai" has 
beautiful cinematography and a compelling 
story. It fight scenes are more exciting than 
"Lord of the Rings" and it has 50 percent 
fewer ogres. 

The Bad: The SCript i wntten by John 
Logan, who has penned uch turds a "The 
TIme 1achlne," the latest aillmated Sinbad 
flick and" tar Trek, emesIs," which holds 
the utle f the worst SCript SlOce "Bannan • 
Robin ." I lopefully 1I10st of this film will be 
ubutled so thc audIence won't havc to hear 

too much of Logan \. brilliant \\Tltll1g. 
The Verdict. Like Cnusc's last dramatic 

action epIC, ",\1Inorlty Report," till one 
leXlks like It will he a flawed masterplccc 

that'~ well worth the nde. 

What Poor Uru\'er al \Varner Bro . has 
unf;lIr1y stolen the entln~ market for exclung 
chlldren '~ mo\,e WIth the wildly popular 
hI larry Potter" serle . Guess It'~ umc to

1)15ney ha~ UIC declslOn-malung skills of a 
drunk pnmate, as endenced hy the Lll.7le 

McGuire phenomenon. 
The Good:Ja on Isaac i on loan from 

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of 
Secrets" to play Captain Hook, and it looks 
Iikc he' going to pull off an amazing per-
formance a la Johnny Depp in the other 
refurhi hed Di ney property, "Pirates of 
the aribbean." Pirates ha\'e all of the fun. 
\Vc're going to ee ome Peter and \"'endy 
flirtation, which will con idcrably raise the 
sex appeal of a film marketed to eight-year-
olds. 

The Bad: If the film is anything like the 
trailer, Coldplay' "Clocks" will be the fly-
ing-tO- everland anthem. Something about 
a Brit-pop group in 19th-century London 
eems vcry, vcry wrong. 

The Verdict: This Christmas, take your 
kids to ee "[[arry Potter." \ Vhat, therc~ no 
"[-larry Potter" movie? Well, take them to 
see thi one instead, if it strikes your fancy.

The Bad: Some people's noses are drawn 
out of proportion, and you may have to read 
some subtitles. 

The Verdict: See this film, and ee it on 
the big screen. Your dreams will thank you. 

What: In this flagrantly indie film, a 
young runaway is dumped into the seedy 
world of truck-stop prostitution. 

The Good: Sundance gave this one a 
Special Jury Priz.e for "artistic merit and 
emotional truth," and for good reason. It's a 
snarling little gem of a stOry, brought kicking 
and screaming to life by accomplished actress 
Judith Ivey and newcomer Emily Grace. 
You're not likely to see a drama with this 
amount of honesty and danger in it for a very 
long time. 

The Bad: The problem with being so 
down to earth i that you end up with a grit-
ty digital video film shot on handheld cam-
eras. It's not a bad as the "Blair Witch 
Project," but the actual lilnunaking leave 
something to be desired. 

The erdict: Pretend it's reality T 
instead of a film so you can ignore the cine-
matOgraphy, and check thIS one Out if you're 
m the mood for a chilling and hard-hitting 
drama. This IS omewhat akll1 to asking 
somebody If they're in the mood for walking 
on glass, but With the film, you get the au -
fJcrion of knOWing that somcone else i 
domg the walkmg for you . 

What: The Farelly brother are at it 
agam. This time, Cameron Diaz won't have 
objectionable hair gel, Jim arrey won't beat 
[he crap out of himself and Jack Black WOlI't 
see wyneth Paltrow as a pig. ' 0, this time, 
the gJmmlck is that Man Damon and reg 
KJI1ncar are conjoined twi~. Thi opens a 
whole can of immen ely funny comedic 
whoop-ass, as we watch the rwins date 
(Surprisel One of them gets in the wayl), as 
we watch the twillS play ~porLS (Surprise! 
One of them geLS In the wayl), and even as 
one of the twm attempts to have sex 
(Surprise l One of them gets m the way!). 
TIllS film is full of many surpnses, but let' 
not rum them. 

The 00<1: This film will be no longer 
thJn two hours long. It nllght he funny. 

' Ine B~d . The Farelly brother have run 
out of steam. Instead of sticking to gag cm 
like "Therc~ IJmcthmg About '\1Jry" or 
"Dumb and Dumber," thclr latest films have 
been formulaIC cOllledy-dramas where ;j \lIlglc

Like glue: Academy Award winners Matt Damon

What: Ewan McGreggor plays a young 
ver ion of Albert Finney who plays a dying 
salesman. And, like all good sale men, 
Finney/Mc reggor ha pent his life telling 
great big lie about the world . In tead of

TH RSDAY, DECEMBER 4, ZOOJ TilE UC 0 GUARDIAN 

The sweet and sour sounds of 2003: The year in music 

~ Billy Gil is year turned out to be pret-ty spectacular for music. Here's the list of my favorite 
records of the year (note: My 
favorite records, not necessarily 
the best ones - I'm no taste dicta-
tor). I apol gize ahead of time 
that I don't listen to more hip-
hop, country or electronic Illusic, 
but there shou ld be something 
everyone enjoys here. They're all 
great records, I promise. 

Zwan - Mary Star of tbt Sta 
Hip ter were allcrgic to Billy 

Corgan' earnest, occasionally 
cheesy lyrics and the general audi-
ence was leery of Zwan's dense 
three-guitar attack. But those who 
stuck around were pleasantly sur-
pri ed by the album's epic format, 
gorgeous harmonies, sing-along 
vocal and intricate guitar work. 
Too bad they didn't last through 
the year, and too bad no one gave 
them a chance. 

Best ong: The ridiculously dis-
torted and dramatic "Declarations 
of Faith." 

The White Stripes - Eltpham 
The Stripes are no gimmick 

band, a they proved with this kick-
ass collection of four-chord romps. 
Whether screaming odes to tena-
cious childhood ("The Hardest 
Button to Button,,) or reviving the 
concept of romance in tender bal-
lads ("I Wanna Be the Boy to Warm 
Your Mother's Heart''), Jack White's 
inging, gu.itar-playing and song-

writing have never sounded better. 
Ditto for pretend-sister Meg 

White's explosively immature 
drumming and cooing counterpart 
vocals. 

Best song: "Black Math," three 
glorious minutes of stomping and 
screaming. 

Cat Power - You Are Fru 
The year's mo t arresting album, 

Yoll Are Fret has 14 songs of heart-
break and the struggle for emotional 
freedom with guest drumming from 
Dave Grahl and occasional vocals 
from Eddie Vedder. 'The true star, of 
course, is the pa sionate ongwriting 
and singing of han Marshall, usual-
ly accompanied by little more than 
her awkward, majestic acoustic gui-
tar. 

" 

itl The songwriting is not as mem-
orable, but they sound better than 
ever with guitar that sound like 
keyboards, drums that sound like 
trains, booty-shaking basslines and 
Julian Casablanca's dry croon. 

Best ong: The urgent howling 
and angular gtlitar-work of 
"Reptilia. " 

Broken Social Scene - You 
Forgot it in Ptople 

Fourteen hip Canadians come 
together from different bands to 
make an album that purrs, jolts and 
gets under your skin before you 
even know it. Boy/girl vocals, 
dreamy guitars, electronic beats 

Best song: "He 
War," in which 
Marshall finally 
loosens up and 
attempts (un uc-
cessfully) to con-
vince us she's "not 
that hot new 
chick." 

Yeah Yea h 
Yeahs - Fever To 
Tell 

This i dirty, 
sloppy, intoxicat-
ing rock 'n roll 

Train and Jet should 
get inw a head,on 

collision and 
disappear as two of 
me worst 'artists' of 

2003." 

and everything else 
under the sun in 
one indie free-for-
all. 

M83 - Dead 
Citits, Red Stas, Lost 
Ghosts 

The best record 
no one heard this 
year was a snlOner 
full of gorgeous 
keyboard land-
scapes, pulsating 
beats and an 

courte y of three bored New 
Yorkers that want you to choke on 
your apathy. They're a loud 
garage-rock band with no bassist 
and a provocative female singer, 
bur there's substance behind the 
hype. Every s ng is full of heart 
and heat. 

Best song: II 1aps," in which 
frontwoman Karen 0 suddenly 
goes soft and sings "wait, they 
don't love you like [love you." 0, 
Karen, wc love you morc. 

T he Strokes - Room on Fire 
Thc Strokes bcat the sopho-

morc slump mercilessly with this 
worthy successor to 2001's Is This 

unmistakable 
human touch. Hard 

to find but well worth the search. 
Xiu Xiu - A Promise 
Xiu Xiu mastermind Jamie 

tewart screeches heart-rending 
accounts of frustration and abuse 
set to sounds of a tonal horns, 
throbbing synths and kitchen-sink 
percussion in this train wreck of an 
album. Caustic, disgusting, 
exhausting and completely unfor-
gettable. 

T he Wrens 
MtadlTWlallds 

Twisty, hook-laden indie-pop 
ranging from piano ballads to up-
tempo rockers that manages to be 
both pleasant and unpredictable.

Deerhoof-Applt 0' 
Spazzy, experimental guitar-

Honorable Mentions: Outkast 
- SptakerboxxlTht Love Beluw and 
Radiohead - Hail To The Thief 

Only these two artists could 
release albums that are both a little 
disappointing yet also works of 
genius. Andre 3000's "Hey Ya" and 
Radiohead's "2+2=5" are two of the 
year's best singles. 

Other notable rccords were 
released this year by Basement 
Jax..'<, the Neptunes, the Shins, the 
Stratford 4, the Ra veonettes and 
Ryan Adams. But besides obvious 
targets such as Britney Spears, 
Limp Bizkit and Clay Aiken, what 
music sucked this year? 

Chingy, tellastarr· and Hillary 
Duff were much-hyped but low-
talent newcomers, true knockoffs 
of su perior artists. Liz Phair, 
Madonna and Black Eyed Peas 
made unwelcome, pandering 
comebacks. Kid Rock, Pink and 
Blink-182 shat out new albums that 
inexplicably got critical attention. 
Train and Jet should get into a 
head-on collision and disappear a 
two of the worst "artists" of Z003. 

But by and large, 2003 was an 
excellent year in music that proved 
the new kids in town are worth 
keeping an eye on. What to expect 
for 2004? Madonna makes out 
with a chicken! The Strokes take a 
shower! And instead of saying and 
doing boneheaded things in pub-
lic, Courtney Love will actually 
relea e music! Whatever happens, 
let's JUSt hope we can escape with-
out hearing another "funky" wnite 
guy with a ")" name. John Mayer, 
Jason Mraz, Jack Johnson, I'm 
looking at you.

• album reviews 

With a cult-like following 
and a career that's spanned 
over a decade, it seem nat-
ural that Tori Amos would 
release a greatest-hits album 
that features 18 of her classic 
songs that have been digital-
ly remastered, along with 
two brand-new tracks. 

In some cases, rema tering 
is a good thing. "God" is 
clearer, especially the back-
ground vocals. In other cases, 

The Shins have crafted 
one of [he year' best pop 
album - indie or not -

fi ode to Brian " ilson har-

the year comes from elec-

whose third album, Kish

of house, e1ectroclash, rock 
and pure pop. Fusing every 
ong with boundless energy 

and memorable hooks, the 
album is exhilarating all the 
way through. 

There's nothing anyone 
hasn't heard from the group 
before, which is be t known

such as "Spark" and 
"Crucify," the songs are so 
overproduced that they lose 
the feeling and meaning they 
originally had, transforming 
heartbreaking songs into less-
inspired pieces. Additionally, 
the dance remix of 
"Professional Widow" adds 
little to what Amos' music is

older songs. The album al 0 
includes "Me and a Gun," 
Amos' haunting ballad about 
her rape (which consists 
solely of vocal), which 
thankfully wasn't touched. 

The album comes with a 
bonus DVD fearuring live 
tracks and an extensive 
photo gallery. It's a nice 
touch, though the live tracks,

would have been better had 
they come from acrual con-

poor sequencing. The 
opening tracks, especially 
"Lucky Star," featuring 
memorable rapping by

overshadowed by the last

such shortcomings are 
heavily outweighed by the

Ho, ho, Hollywood: Santa's many faces 
From Ernest to heroic, Santa's had many portrayals through the years 

By JESSE KIVEL 
Staff Writer 

Although the leaves arc not changing colors and snow is not starting to blanket UC D, 
the holidays are ju t around the 
corner. Throughout the chaos of 
the holiday sea on, there has bet:n 
one man who has stood above the 
rest. His name is Santa C laus. But 
who is thi jolly man in a big red 
suit dishing out presents to good 
linle children? What is he all 
about? To find out, look no fur-
ther than to the least reliable 
place on earth : you guessed it, 
Hollywood. 

T he Stereotypical anta 

This particular Santa is the one 
our culture i most familiar with . 
Complete with everything from a 
big white beard to a hefty frame , 
this Santa i the one that get all 
the publicity. A cia sic example is 
George Seaton 's "Miracle on 34th 
St." In this movie, an old man 
who calls himself Kris Kringle and 
claim to be Santa Claus takes up 
a job a~ a shopping mall Santa . I Ie 
ha many skeptics and is forced to 
go to court to prove his identity. 
In a heroic finish, he ends up 
changing the cynical minds of 
adults and children alike by prov-
ing he i , in fact, Santa Claus. The 
tereotypical anta always has to 

triumph against overwhelming 
odds, but alway comes out victo-
rious in the end. This Santa is 
more than just a man and is the 
Santa you don 't want to pick a 
fight with. Although he is vety 
jolly, he tend ro have a bit of a 
mean streak, which results in a 
large pi ece o f coal being placed in 
the stoclcing of naug hty children . 

The "Emest" anta 

O K, thiS i n't a real category, but 
everyhody would want J 1m Varney 
to dress up in a big red SUit and 
de1i\'cr them present.s. In "Ernest 
Save Chn~lma ," Erne~1 IS up to 
hiS u ual crazy anne when ant3 
Clau deCides to retire. Frnest 
take over Sa nta's Job and baSical-
ly aClS like a tO lal moron fo r an 
hour and a half of fun-filled, 
wacky hu m or. The" rne~t" San ta 
is no di fferent than rOllr typical 
Ernest. Filled With obnOXIOUs 
o ne- li ners an d bizarre facia l 
expre ions, thiS anta I cet talll ly

has no superhuman powers and is 
actually less coordinated than 
most five -year-olds . Although 
foolish, this anta i the nicest of 
the bunch and will be sure to give 
you your presents, unless he 
breaks his neck fa lling through 
your chimney. 

T h e H eroic Santa 

Each year, many children have to 
face the reality that Santa is living 
in the bedroom next to theirs, as 
opposed to the orth Pole. And 
year after year, this middle-aged 

anta tries va liantly to instill the 
spirit of Christmas in all of his chil-
dren, but usually fails miserably. In 
" ational Lampoon's Christmas 
Vacation," Clark W. Griswold rries 
to provide his kids with the 
Christmas of a lifetime, 
Unfortunately but inevitably there 
are a variety of mishaps and failures 
along the way. The Heroic Santa 
repre ents the majority of Santas in 
the world. De pite meaning well, 
they alway end up getting the 
wrong gifts for their kids, most 
likely scarring them emotiona ll y 
for the rest of their lives. The bot-
tom line is that these Santas are 
good-hearted men who have only 
the beSt intentions in mind. 

The Drunken Santa with a 
Heart of Gold 

This Santa will easi ly become 
your favorite anta. Although he 
is a sloppy drunk and barely able 
to stand, he is always able to deliv-
er important life les$ons to chil-
dren in need. In "Home Alone," 
the drunken Santa i ca ll ed on to 
guide Kevin McCalister toward 
the path of righteousnes . 
Although Santa has a minute role 
in this movie of mayhem, he pro-
vides Kevin with a good dose of 
moral goodness that makes 
him realize that what he 
truly wants fo r Chri una 
I his fam il y. If you

instinct to run screaming, and 
instead have a conversation with 
him, Although his slurred speech 
is hard to decipher, beneath that 
whisky-soaked beard are priceless 
words o f wisdom. Don't eKpect 
good gifts from this Santa, 
though; he only gives out orange 
Tic Tacs. 

T he Stupid Santa 

This Santa can only be played by 
sitcom actors desperately trying to 
prove their worth on the big screen. 
Tim Allen in "The Santa Clause" is 
the perfect example of the tupid 
Sama. After Santa is lOlled in a freak 
accident, the title of Santa Claus is 
passed on to Scon Calvin (Tim 
Allen). The Stupid Santa i a 
"wannabe" Santa. An early sign that 
you have an impo tor on your 
hands is that he is dressed up in 

tereotypical Santa gear. This is 
JUSt a facade becau e in tmtll , he has 
none of Stereotypical Santa's acrual 
powers. The only thing that the 
Snlpid Santa provides is a slew of 
endless bad jokes and a desire to 
scream every time you hear the 
words " home improvement." 

The Tenninator Santa 

T his Santa is usually masked by a 
thick Austrian acce nt and can be 
seen running our beloved state of 
California. In "J ingle All the 
Way," Arnold plays a father who 
will do anything to get his kid the 
toy that he wants . Truth hilly, I 
have no idea what this movie was 
about. All I can say is that I want 
that hour and a half of my life 
back. The Terminator Santa can 
beat up all the other anus and 
has been known to sexually harass 
Mrs. Claus. \Nhatever you do, stay 
away from the Terminator ant3 !

l1iE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 17 

Old Globe's 'Grinch' will steal your heart away 
Terrific acting contributes to a faithful retelling of Dr. Seuss's classic children's story 

By IONATHEN JOSEPHSON 
Senior Staff Writer 

There are three things that guarantee a holiday-musical box office success. 1) Strong 
hum mabie songs and dynamic 
voices to sing them. 2) A green 
su pe r-vi Iia in-turn ed -sweethea rt 
that looks like a cross between 
Cousin It, broccoli and Captain 
Caveman. 3) A 40-pound starlet 
with a giant pink bow and a "wit-
de" pink dress that sings all of 
Whooville a lullaby. Collected 
upon John Lee Beatty's pic-
turesque, snowy, Suessian set and 
projected by the bounCing riffs of 
Mel Marvin and colorful book and 
lyrics by TImothy Mason, "How 
the Grinch Stole Chri tmas! 
2003" is a fun, light musical for the 
inner chIld as well as the outer car-
oler. 

The play begins with the bril-
liant Ken Page (lead in the origi-
nal cast of "Cats," winner of a 
Drama Desk Award for "Ai n 't 
Misbehavin''') cast as Old Max, 
our narrator and guide. Page's 
deep, reverberant voice serves as 

a warm blanket among the froz.en 
sight before us as he leads us 
through the story of the Grinch, 
his old boss. Through his eyes, 
we see all of Whooville - the 
land of perpetual Christmas 
where the stores are always col-
ored in red and white and the 
inhabitants are shaped Jike candy 
and painted like ornaments . Only 
the Grinch, in his sulking green, 
stands out among the candy-
cane-colored countryside. 

Played by David Brannen, the 
Grinch struts a bout wi th a mon-
sterly form that is a character all 
its own. Thankfully, there is no 
Jim Carrey and no cartoon, but a 
brooding, bombastic, and tender 
Grinch, the likes of which I have 
never before seen. It is his gen-
uine affinity for tiny Cindy-Lou 
Who that truly melts away his 
froz.en feelings of loathing. 
Unlike most children's tales, 
cause and effect in this story is 
purposely and clearly motivated 
on both ends. Credit an adher-
ence to the intent of the good 
doctor's story and solid attention 
to detail by the director, Old 

Globe Jack O'Brien (who is also 
the Old Globe Artistic Director), 
for making these moments hap-
pen. 

And talk about that Cindy-
Lou Who! Though only a 6-
year-old, Shawn Moriah Sullivan 
takes the stage like a pro and 
ste ps up to the demanding role. 

Surprisingly, this kid can work it. 
ot to mention the entire Young 

Who ensemble whose energy and 
exuberance lifted the show from 
a dry spell. The young-uns were 
fearured in one of the opening 
numbers doing what kids do best:

The insanity of Broken Social Scene 
Indie-rock collective's Kevin Drew chats about the band's unique sound 

By BILLY GIL 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

It's a Saturday night at the Casbah, and Broken Social cene's Kevin Drew is buzzing 
and tripping over wires as he tries 
to get his gear ready for the last 
show of the band's tour. Along 
with fellow tourmate Stars, 
Broken Social Scene has set out to 
prove that Canada, our neighbor 
to the north is much hipper than 
we imagined. I ts latest album, YoIl 
Forgor It In People, is a fever dream 
of space-rock guitars and disjoint-
ed vocals. With as many as 14 
members writing, singing and 
playing on the album, it's a glori-
ous mess and one of the year's best 
albums. 

Drew responds to questions 
with teenage enthusiasm and is 
both hilarious and polite. He does-
n'r even get sore tha t I got his name 
wrong. (Give me a break, there are 
14 of them.) 

Guardian: There's a lot going 
on in this record. The song 
"Almost Crimes" starts out with a 
piano riff and then gets interrupted 
by feedback. What's the process for 
writing a song like that? How do 
you know when the song is done? 

Kevin Drew: Well, Billy, you 
start writing one song that turns 
into a total disaster. So you decide 
on the spot that you should start 
writing another song, and then in 
25 minutes, that turns into some-
thing great. And then you say, 
"Let's put this, let's put that," and 
then you say, "Who hasn't played 
yet?" And then your friend Leslie 
[Feist of By Divine Right] comes 
over and says, "1 love it! Can I just 
try inging on it really quickly?" 
And then she sings on it really 
quickly and you say, "That sounds 
fucking great!" And then someone 
says, "I'd really love to do this lit-
tle piano intro at the beginning." 
And then they do it, and then 
you're like, "That's great!" And 

then you mix it, and that's what 
happens. 

G: You obviously have a lot of 
material and members to work 
with. How do you put a record 
together as a whole? 

KD: There are a lot of people 
involved, with a lot of influences, 
doing the things that they need to 
do to make the music that has to 
be made for them to be satisfied as 
human beings. It's a whole group 
of people sharing their ideas and 
getting their influences out, and 
we knew we weren't going to 
make one sound of a record 
because there are too many 
human beings involved. We want-

" Look at all these people -it's a whole 'mare is more' 
scenario - the more the 
merrier. We just really 

wanted to 'ramma 
. , ]amma, man. 

- Kevin Drew, Broken Social 
Scene 

ed to tackle a few things. like pop, 
which was something kind of 
strange to a few of us. We ju t 
decided we were going to go in 
and try to see wha t happens when 
you put a whole bunch of people 
together in a room. 

G: Do you think people are 
more open ro different band setups 
now, like the Poylphonic Spree, 
which has 20-something people 
with different instruments) People 
are generally predisposed to four 
skinny white guys playing guitars 
rather than glockenspiels and 
whatever else. 

KD: I think 'more is more' right 
now. Look at all these people - it's 

a whole 'more is more' scenario -
the more the merrier. We just real-
ly wanted to 'ramma jamma,' man. 

G: This is your first time in 
San Diego and YOli guys are obvi-
ously gaining a lot of momentum. 
You've gotten rave reviews and 
the Juno [Canadian music award, 
won for Best Alternative Album]; 
how is this momentum affecting 
the band? 

KD: It's affecting it quite 
greatly beca use there's purpose 
for us to do thi ngs. Before, you 
just did it because you loved it, 
but now you do it because you 
have to: It's your life and people 
want to hear you. and it just lcind 
of puts the purpose inside getting 
in a van and eating shitty food 
across a fucked-up country for so 
long. 

G: Do you hope for this band to 
be a long-term thing? 

KD: It's gonna be a long-term 
thing. The only thing that can 
destroy us is overexpo ure and that 
doesn't happen anymore to bands 
like us. There'll be ins and outs and 
ups and downs and all the things 
that come with life. There'll be 
chi ldren. there ' ll be marriages, 
there'll be pain. there'll be beauty, 
there'll be life and death and rivers 
and oceans and sidewalks and high-
ways and burgers and fries and 
potatoes and tomatoes and acoustic 
guitars and acoustic xylophones 
and saxophones, violins and 
spoons, you know? Choirs and 
punks. There'll be massages, 
there'll be lots of ex. That's what it 
will be like. Oh my God. this is the 
end,eh? 

G: One more. You guys are 
afraid of overexposure, so you 
won't be on TRL anytime soon? 

KD: We were on 'You Hear It 
First' on MTv. 

G: h rcally? Then I guess you 
guys are done. You're not an indie 
band anymore. 

KD: Yeah, you know what? 
Indic's just a legend. But you gotta 
tay true to the legend.

Domini a they ailcd to a sev-
enth-place fintsh in the Varsity A 

dm~ion, but it was the consistent 
sailing of Jeff imon and Chris 

iLen in the Laser di\~sion that 
allowed C D to nudge past Cal 
in the final standing. 

UC D's vo junior varsity 
division boats managed to place 
eighth and ninth out of 15 and 
once again demonstrated the 
depth of this young tcam. 

With the UCSD sailing team 
mostly compri ed of sophomore 
and freshmen, the future looks 
bright a each regatta ee UCSD 
claiming the overall results. 
Despite a break in the regatta 
schedule, UCSD won't be cutting 
back on practice. 

h1en's ultimate 
The UC D ultimate fri bee 

teams hosted 12 other college in 
the annual SoCal \Varm- p 
Tournament on Nov. 22 and 0 \ '. 
23, an event intended to get ome 
experience under the belts of new 
member . UCSD's Air Squids 
diVided themseke into three sep-
arate squads, dubbed Jihad, 
Potassium and Le Lube to com-
pete aga inst opponents from 
around California and Arizona. 

Team Jihad cruised through all 
of their games on Nov. 22, cap-
ping the day with a 15-7 victory 
over arch rivals C anta Barbara 
Blackride's spli t quad. Team 
Potassium was not so fortunate, 
losing cia e game to UCLA and 
Occldemal, but beating :-.'orrhern 
Anzona at the end of pool pla~'. 
Team Le Lube farcd well again t 
their carly opponents, but came 
up shorr again t the two-time 
defending champIOn Anwna. 

halftime. It was assumed to be 8-6 
in favor of the quids, and an 
agreeme nt wa made between the 
twO teams' captains that the game 
would be played to II because 
daylight was running horr. After 
the agreement was made, a Squid 
captain pointcd Out that the point 
total hould have been odd, but 
that issue was never re olved 
between the two teams. the 
teams ran out of daylight, the 
score was 10-9, advantage Squids. 
After much discussion, the cap-
tains agreed to play early next 
morning. Resuming play at a.m. 
the following morning, UCSB 
committed an unforced error at 
the goal line, and after a time out, 
UC D's tephen Ringel broke the 
mark with a lefty high-release 
backhand to put the game away, 
11-9. 

The other pre-quarter game 
also featured UCS D against 
UCSB. Team Potassium could 
not hold on to their early lead, 
and lost to a UCSB team, \3-12 . 
The loss sent Potassium into the 
"beer" bracket on, ov. 23, where 
they defcated niversi ty of an 
Diego and Cal Poly San Loui 
Obispo in the "beer" quarters 

and emifinals. Due to everal 
injuries, UCSB was forced to for-
feit , and the Potassium squad 
became the Beer Bracket 
Champion by default. 

Meanwhile, in the champi-
onship bracket, Squids were pit-
ted against their fellow team-
mates as Jihad and Le Lube faced 
off in the quarters. The twO 
team played a hard -fought game, 
with Jihad coming out on top, 14-
9.Jihad then defeated UCLA, 11 -
9, in the semi-fi nal match-up. 
However, it ran out of gas, and 
the split squad lost, 15-5, to the 
eventual back-to-back- to-back 
SoCal \Varm- p Tournament 
champions, Arizona . 

Overall, the Squids had a 
strong hawing in their fir t tour-
nament of the year. The three 
teams finished econd, fifth and 
ninth out of 16 teams. The large 
group of returning A-team players 
bode well for the future of the 
Squids. Notable players for 
UCSD included Garrett \ ong, 
Robert Langser, Matthew \-Valler 
and Sunny Saini .

I Club Sports 
Surfing 

The second event of the 
National Scholastic Surfing 
Association college chedule took 
place on Nov. 22 at UC D's home 
break, Blacks Beach. Large waves, 
cold air and a high tide caused all of 
the teams to set up their tents at the 
base of the cliffs to avoid getting 
wet. The UCSD team immediately 
showed oFf their loca l knowledge 
by ituating their large white Rusty 
tent high above tl,e beach, over-
looking the contest site and away 
from the elements. 

From the get-go, all of UCSD's 
surfers looked comfortable and 
confident in the unruly surf, while 
other tcams were haken and 
intimidated by the power that 
Blacks had to offer. With three 
competitive teams, each consisting 
of six ma le shortboarders, one 
female surfer, one longboardcr and 
one bodyboarder, UCSD had a 
presence in most of the heats 
throughout the day. As the day pro-
gressed and competitors from the 
other 30 or so teams lost their 
heats, U D's tcams continued to 
advance. 

A dramatic break in the action 
occurred when a huge slab of tl,e 
cliffs hanging over Blacks Beach 
came down. Dozens of people had 
been spectating below the cliffs, 
and all of them were forced to run 
as large boulders and rubble fe ll 
from hundreds of feet above them. 
Nobody was injured, though a 
number of surfboards and wetsults 
were lost in the rubble. 

Following the cliff collapse, the 
competition was put on hold. 
Lifeguards, police, other officials 
and media all came to the site of the 
rockslide to ensure the safety of the 
area. 

"I've never witnessed a rockslide 
nearly that big at Blacks, and I've 
also never seen so many people 
hanging out in such a precarious 
position under the cliffs," UCSD's 
team capta in Dan Hodul said. "We 
were very lucky not to have lost 
multiple people in that mess." 

An hour or s after the rock-
slide, competition re umed, and 
UCSD picked up where it had left 
off. Eventually, many of UCSD's 
competitors were narrowl y defeat-
ed in the smaller, les hapely surf, 

eounesy of UCSD Recreation 
Leaping ahead: The UCSD equestnan club team took home the Champion 
Prize at theIr competItion on Nov. 15. 

THE U D GUARDIAN 

but come finals time, 
UCSD still had a num-
ber of people still in the 
running. Bodyboarder 

ick Statom dominated all 
day, but scored a disappoint-
ing third-place finish in his 
division . 

For the UCSD womcn, 
both Loryn Wilson and 
Megan Manuel made the 
final s. Wil on, defending 
national and state champion, 
rcceived her worst result to 
date, a fourth-place finish , while 
Manuel stepped up and placed sec-
ond for UCSD's "C" team. Both 
Gary Trischman and Zach Plopper 
made the mens final. Trischman 
received fourth place. Plopper had 
won each of his heats all day en 
route to the final, but he broke his 
board in the semis. Forced to rely 
on a backup board, Plopper was 
still able to beat fellow competitors 
and win the event. 

Overall, UCSD dominated. 
The "C" team took I Oth place and 
the "B" team tOok fifth - beating 
the majori ty of other schools' "An 
teams. The CSD U .. team won 
the whole event by a landslide. 

,oing into the next event in first 
place, UC D's team is looking to 
repeat thi year as both state and 
national champiOns. 

Women' Rugby 
The CS D women's rugby 

team is quickly earnmg a reputa-
tion of winning anything and 
everythi ng it doc. ase in point, 
its first tournament of the season in 
Las Vega: In pite of not traveling 
with the full squad, the Triton won 
the women's di~sion, finishing the 
weekend undefea ted. 

UC D was up and running on 
Nov. , notching two wins against 
Utah St3tc by the score of 15-7 and 
shutti ng out Las Vegas, 40-0, in a 
display of offen ive and defensive 
ruthl ess ness. The following day 
proved to be nerve-wrenching for 
the team and fa ns alike, with 
UC D prevailing in a close 7-5 ~c-

tory 
over Coast, a women's club team. 
The ov. 9 championship game 
featured a slightly modified 10-on-
10 match-up, but UCSD was able 
to adapt easily, taking first place on 
the weekend. 

Equestrian 
The UCSD equestrian team has 

quickly established itself to be a 
divi ion powerhouse thi year, con-
sistently placing among the top col-
leges on the we t coa t. t its first 
home show, it was no different, 
WIth multiple rider taklJ1g first 
place 111 their classes, anti the team 
taking home the ChampIOn Prize 
on I ' ov. 1-. 

Captain Kate ,\lcComas began 
the day on a high note, taking tir!.t 
in open jumping. LlI1da Torres also 
took first 111 intermediate Jumping 
and open flat, \\'1J1ning the Nov. 15 
Highpoint Rider Champi on Prize, 
with McComas winning Reserve 
Champion 1 Iighpoint Rider. 

On Nov. 16, captain Marce 
Evans fini hed first in novice jump-
ing, qualifying her for regional 
championships 111 M.arch and mov-
ing up a di~sion to the intermedi -
ate jumping class in the next com-
petition. Torres won her intermedi-
ate kumping class again on I ov. 16, 
also qualifying her for regional 
championship and mo~ng up a 
division to open jumping. 

PORT 23 

McComas won her open flat class, 
with freshman Cassie La Bouff 
winning the novice flat clas . The 
team finished as reserve champi-
ons by a mere four points over 

cross-town rivals U niversi ly 
of San Diego. 

The following week-
end the team pulled 
double duty with an 

English sholv on 
Nov. 22 hosted by 

U D and a western 
show on ov. 

23. By late 
Nov. 23 , UCS D 

proved ~ctorious once 
again by taking home the Reserve 
Champion Prize and remains the 

o. I equestrian team in Southern 
California. Instrumental in this ~c­
tory were two-time champion
