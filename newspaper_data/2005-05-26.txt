Study finds lack_of 
UC female faculty 

Legislature held hearings 
. . - . 

on unIversIty recruItment 
By MARNETTE FEDERIS 

Senior Staff Writer 

The University of California 
has failed to raise irs percentage 
of female faculty hires, despite 
an increase in the hiring of new 
professors in recent years, as well 
as a growth in the percentage of 
women getting doctorate degrees, 
according to a recently released 
report written by four UC Davis 
professors. The report claims 
that the university discriminates 
against women by continuing to 
lag in irs hiring of female faculty. 

Titled "Unprecedented 
Urgency: Gender Discrimination 
in Faculty Hiringatthe University 
of California," the report has 
come in the midst of the univer-
si ty's to-year plan to increase irs 
hiring of professors to meet the 
demands of a growing student 
population and to replace retir-
ing facul ty. The report states that 
women made up 36 percent of the 
newly hired faculty in 2003-04, 
which was the same proportion as 

in the previous year. Meanwhile, 
over 45 percent of all doctorate 
degrees in 2003 were awarded to 
women. 

The study claims that the 
number of females hired by the 
university dropped dramatically 
after the UC Board of Regenrs 
abolished the use of affirmative 
action in 1995 following the pas-
sage of Proposition 209, which 
banned the state from consid-
ering race or gender in hiring 
decisions. 

"We have been monitor-
ing the hiring of women faculty 
for many years," UC Davis law 
professor and co-author of the 
report Martha West said. "After 
(the) regents abolished affirma-
tive action, we started noticing 
(that) the percentage of women at 
UC Davis was declining rapidly. 
At UC Davis, the numbers went 
from 52 percent to \3 percent." 

However, national doctoral

Aid: Grants would help 
improve spirit, Watson says 

conlinued {rom page I 
student population, 

Some faculty members 
expressed concerns that the pro-
posal would alter the spirit of 
UCSD, which has historically 
prided itself in accepting students 
based on their academic, rather 
than athletic, abilities. 

Kwinn said she worried the 
scholarship plan would open the 
door for the university to con-
sider athletic ability as part of the 
admission process, instead of just 
rewarding athletes monetarily. 

"The proposal would just 
increase the pool of athletically 
gifted students at UCSD because 
the financial aid to students will 
not give them enough aid," she 
said . "It doesn't reward them.n 

Watson, however, said that no 
special consid.erations would be 
given since every athlete would 
qualify for the same amount of 
money as long as they maintained 
a 2.6 GPA in their sophomore 
year and a 2.7 GPA in their junior 
year, regardless of the spolt they 
participated in. 

"Academics are always of top 
priority,n Watson said. 

However, the proposal would 
also allow each team to raise addi-
tional funds and appropriate them 
exclusively to team members, a 
provision that has caused uneasi-
ness among the members of the 
campus' Council of Provosts. 

Former A.S, Commissioner of 
Athletics Bryce Warwick, who is 
graduating this spring, said he 
does not think he will give money 

back to UCSD as an alumnus 
because he feels the university 
does not appreciate the effort and 
valuable time athletes contribute 
to the school. 

"You may be surprised what 
5500 is for a student because you 
can use those two or three hours 
(per week] to study instead of 
work," Warwick said. "It may be 
a small monetary amount, but it 
can make a big difference." 

The plan would also increase 
Triton spirit, Watson said. 

"We want to support students 
and give them school pride," he 
said. "We'll have better alwnni to 
affiliate and come back to UCSD." 

Former A.S. President and 
the A.S. Council's representative 
to the Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee Jenn Pae also said 
the grants would boost campus 
morale and express gratitude to 
award athletes, 

"From the 280 schools in 
Division II, we are the only one 
that doesn't offer aid," Watson 
said. "It's a disadvantage when we 
want to recruit the best students 
academically and on-field compet-
itors, but it is very difficult when 
we don't support aid and must tell 
students and parents this." 

UCSD has obtained a waiver 
from the NCAKs scholarship 
requirement for the 2005-06 aca-
demic year, but administrators 
are not sure if the association will 
renew it in future years.

I A.s. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting f4 - May 2S 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item A 

The council passed a resolu-
tion extending the deadline for 
developing a grievance system for 
future controversies surrounding 
the A.S. media services, including 
Student-Run Television. 

The original resolution set a 
May 25 deadline for the institu-
tion of the program, but deter-
mined that a deadline should be 
moved ro Oct. 5. The councils 
resolution did not call on SR1V 
to continue its suspension of 
indecent materials. 

Old Business 
Item A 

The council amended its 
financial bylaws in order to allow 
student organizations to apply for 
funding for conferences and com-
petitions that take place during 
the summer, Some councilmem-
bers said that they were wor-

on 

ried that the funding of summer 
conferences was fiscally irrespon-
sible considering that the council 
would not have any income dur-
ing the time. 

Other members, however, said 
that student organizations with 
summer conferences should not 
be penalized for the timing. The 
council passed the legislation by a 
vote of 19-1-3. 

Item T 
After long debate, the coun-

cil approved the A.S. executive 
budget for 2005-06. The council 
amended the budget to decrease 
allocations to the A.S. elections 
and the A.S. Safe Rides line-
items. 

The approved budget for A.S. 
Safe Rides resulted in an alloca-
tion of the total amount spent in 
the 2004-05 school year. 

The savings from these reduc-
tions were used to increase fund-
ing for student organizations 
and the sum allocated to annual 
events.

aedit management 
The average outstanding aedit-

card balance maintained by under-
graduate college students fell to 
S2,169 last year, its lowest level 
since 1998, according to a new 
study released by student loan pro-
vider Nellie Mae. 

The data pointed to a leveling off 
of sharply increasing credit card usage 
among college students, a public pol-
icy issue that has become a point of 
concern in recent yec1~ 

According to the survey, 76 percent 
of college students that began school 
in 2004 possessed a credit card, an 8 
percent decrease from 2001. 

More than half of the students said 
that they first obtained their charge 
cards at the age of 18, pointing to fresh-
man year as the most prevalent time for 
students to open new credit accounts. 

. In addition, the average number 
of credit cafds per student fell slightly 
from 4.15 cards in 2001 to 4.09 cards 
in 2004. 

"The fact that the average credit 
card usage has declined among 
undergraduates in the past three 
years can be viewed as a sign that 
the message to use credit respon-
sibly is reaching its intended audi-
ence: Nellie Mae Vice President of 
Marketing Marie O'Malley stated in a 
press release. 

In particular, O'Malley said the 
company was concerned that some 
students were using the high-inter-
est credit cafds to pay for school 
expenses, with almost a quarter of 
all students saying that they used 
them to pay their regular tuition. 
Overall, school supplies represented 
the leading expenditures bought 
with credit. 

Drunk students face 
higher injury, rape risk 

College students who get drunk 
at least once a week face a sig-
nificantly higher risk of being hurt or 
injured than nondrinkers, researchers 
from Wake Forest University School 
of Medicine reported at the annual 
meeting of the Society of Academic 
Emergency Medicine. 

Part of the five-year resea rch proj-
ect, the results were collected in an 
effort to reduce drinking on college 
campuses, 

Wake Forest reseafchers reported 
that students who regulany get intoxi-
cated were twice as fikely to fall from 
a height than nondrinkers, and were 
75 percent more likely to be sexually 
victimized. 

'Wlen you drink, you're also at risk 
because of other people's drinking: 

... 

the university's assistant professor of 
medicine and public health sciences 
Mary Oaire O'Brien stated in a press 
release. 

The researchers defined students 
with "problem drinking" as hav!ng 
four or five drinks in a short period 
of time. 

Bill would dose h~­
interest loan loophole 

A new bill introduced by Sen. 
Edward Kennedy (O-Mass.) and Sen. 
Patty Murray (D-Wash.) would close a 
loophole in the federal student loan 
program that has allowed \enders to 
receive billions of dollars in unintend-
ed profit from the federal government 
over the last decade. 

If passed, the legislation would 
end a controversial bank subsidy that 
guarantees student lenders a 9.5 rate 
of return on certain student loans. 
That amount is almost three times the 
actual interest rate paid by students, 
meaning that the govemment has 
had to make up the remaining 6.1 
percent in the form of a subsidy. 

Lawmakers had intended to end 
the special loan guarantee more than 
10 years ago, but lenders have been 
able to use a narrowly tailored excep-
tion induded in the law at the time to 
continue to charge the govemment 
extra interest on a certain class of 
loans, 

During the first three months of 
the current fiscal year, that exception 
has cost the govemment $262 mil-
lion, according to data maintained by 
the Department of Education. 

'Congress should stop pander-
ing to the money-lenders and close 
thiS outrageous loophole once and 
for all: Kennedy stated in a press 
release. "This taxpayer rip-off is cost-
ing us a billion dollars a year - near-
ly $3 million a day - and denying 
more students the chance to go to 
college."

THURSDAY, MAy 26, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 1 

. CCO: 'Listening tour' suggests that budget cuts hurt college students 
continued from page I 

tion for young people who want to 
pursue it." 

CCO conducted its tour all over 
the state, seeking out parents, high 
schools, businesses, labor and reli-
gious leaders and community orga-
nizations in order to gain a wide 
perspective of how people have 
been affected by the state budget 
crisis and their ideas on college 
access. 

In the last several years, the 
state cuts have caused college class-
es to be canceled, reduced course 
offerings and fewer opportunities 
for students to interact with faculty, 
it stated. 

KWe found that colleges need 
to provide more core courses, 
counselors and student services 
so students can get the classes 
they need to meet their goals and 
complete their majors on time," 
Soltani said. "There was a strong 
consensus that we need additional 
state funding. The government 
needs to make higher education a 
top priority." 

According to CCO 
Communications Director Elisa 
Bongiovanni, older interviewees 
generally agreed on the need for 
universal college opportunities for 
all students. She attributed that 
policy position to the state's Master 
Plan for Education, enacted in 
1960, which promises anyone who 
wants to go to college the chance 
to do so. 

Because of the current increase 
in students entering college - a 
jump referred to as "tidal wave 
two" - approximately 750,000 
Californian students will not be 
able to find a place in higher 
education in future years, accord-
ing to Athena Perrakis, a profes-
sor of leadership studies at the 
University of San Diego and a 
participant in the tour's brain-

storming sessions. 
"The older Californians who 

benefited [from the Master Plan 
for Education) feel responsible 
to the younger generation," 
Bongiovanni said. "They want 
them to have the same opportuni-
ties that they had.» 

However, the public as a whole 
seemed generally uninformed 
about the barriers to college access 
prior to the tour, according to San 
Diego Community College District 
Chancellor Constance M. Carroll. 

KI was surprised that the gen-
eral public seemed unaware of the 
issue of capacity," Carroll stated 
in an e-mail. "When they under-
stood how few universities there 
were in California compared to 
1960 when the Master Plan was 
adopted, they grasped the prob-
lem quickly." 

The report also profiled current 
students from 68 colleges. 

Elyde Arroyo, an interviewee 
from the tour, commutes to San 
Diego Mesa College, San Diego 
Community College and Miramar 
College in order to get all the 
classes she needs. CCO asked her 
about the strUggles of community 
college and financial challenges. 

"All the classes I need are not 
offered at JUSt one college," Arroyo 
said. "The science and math class-
es are hard to get, especially at 
Miramar, and the waitlist is for-
ever." 

According to Arroyo, due to 
the budget, community colleges 
have laid off professors, deplet-
ing the number of classes offered 
to students. Additionally, students 
complain of long waitlists for gen-
eral education and transfer classes 
a t the colleges. 

Providing new research for the 
report, the California Postsecondary 
Education Committee project-
ed that, by 2013, college enrolJ-

ment will increase by 672,489 
in California's community col-
leges, 119,044 students in the 
California State University system 
and 45,560 additional students for 
the University of California . San 
Diego, in particular, will experience 
significant growth, CCO reported. 

"In the next 10 years we will 
see a dramatic growth in the col-
lege population," CPEC act-
ing Executive Director Murray 
Haberman said. "We are trying our 
best to accommodate all students 
and provide operational resources 
to future students." 

Haberman said the importance 
of higher education for future gen-
erations made long-term planning 
an urgent priority. 

"Higher education plays a criti-
cal role in our futures," Haberman 
said. KBeyond educational, [it 
involves] economical develop-
ment." 

Carroll said she agreed, explain-
ing that higher education was 
linked to the health of California's 
future economy. 

"California's economy is direct-
ly dependent upon its educational 
system," Carroll said. "The UC is 
the research engine, the CSU is 
the institution of practical applica-
tion and the California community 
colleges provide the access students 
need to move through higher edu-
cation. Since over 80 percent of 
new jobs require at least a year 
of college study, California will 
not continue to be competitive if 
it provides insufficient access to 
higher education. Lack of capac-
ity, underfunding and budget cuts 
are not the best way to address the 
largest increase in student demand 
for higher education in the history 
of the sta teo " 

Recommendations to lawmak-
ers made by CCO include devel-
oping a lQ-year higher education 

!)1Tl" . 

plan, making funding for educa-
tion a top priority by developing 
a long-term financing plan, and 
encouraging higher education 
leaders to share resources and 
to set a predictable fee policy. 
In addition, the plan calls for 
more financial aid and improving 
the education of parents and stu-
dents about college opportunities, 
beginning in middle school. 

"We want to communicate to 
parents and students as young as 
middle school that college isn't 
as expensive as it's perceived," 
Soltani said . "We want them to 
understand that financial aid is 
available." 

In response to the report, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's budget 
spokesman, H .D. Palmer, said that 
higher education is a top priority in 
the governor's state funding plans. 

"As long as he is governor, there 
will be ongoing growth and com-
mitment to higher education," 
Palmer said. "For the future, we 
intend to put a ceiling on how 
much student fees can increase, 
and we want to improve the time 
to graduate so they can do it in 
four years." 

UC Office of the President 
spokeswoman Ravi Poorsina said 
the university agreed with the sug-
gestions found in the report. 

"We think being accessible to all 
students is important and we want 
to satisfy the demands out t"ere," 
Poorsina said. "[The CCO's) mis-
sion is a good one, and as a state, 
it's something we need to think 
about."

Settlement the best 
option in Kashmiri suit 
Som etimes justice is hard to attain, but it certainly looks like any 
semblance of justice will be 
ab ent from the final out-
come of the Kashmiri pro-
fessional-student fee lawsuit. 

Theclassactionsuit, which 
alle~es that the University of 
Ca~fornia 's fee increases vio-
lated a contract with its pro-
fessional students, will mean 
higher fees, no matter how 
its decided. 

For the university, the 
worst-case scenario is losing 
the case outri~ht - some-
thing that's qwte likely, con-
sidering the statements the 
presiding judge has made 
In recent rulings. However, 
documents presented to the 
UC Board of Regents indi-
cate tha t a victory by the 
students involved in the suit, 
the last of whom Will gradu-
ate next year, means that the 
Board will likely raise fees 
for other students enrolled 
in its professional schools to 
offset its loss. 

On the other hand, the 
best-case scenario for the 

university is a victory occur-
ring months down the road, 
coming as a result of the 
protracted legal process. Of 
course, by that time, most of 
the affected students will have 
graduated, and the university 
has admitted it will have little 
luck getting them to pay the 
judgment. Ironically, this will 
once again mean higher fees 
for all of the other students 
attending UC professional 
schools. 

Under both options, the 
result will be a transfer of 
funds from younger students 
to pay the debts of their 
older colleagues, with the 
university itself untouched 
- and that's certainly not 
justice. 

Instead of spending more 
money on its lawyers, the 
university should settle the 
suit now - an option the 
plaintiffs said they would be 
amenable to - before the 
affected class gr:aduates, 

Though far from real jus-
tice, a settlement represents 
the best solution for UC 
campuses and their students. 

Admin. input needed 
in O.A.S.I.S. debate 

W hen Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger criticized formula-
ic "autopilot" spending, he 
wasn't talking aoout the for-
mula used to fund UCSD's 
Office of Academic Support 
and Institutional Sel"V1ces. 
However, there is no more 
logic to the O .A,S.LS, 
budgetary scheme than 
those of the programs 
Schwarzenegger criticized. 

With the center facing 
cuts to its permanent bud:' 
get, the way the univer-
sity appropriates temporary 
funds needs to be re-exam-
ined. 

Currently, those appro-
priations depend on the 
performance of broadly 
classified "at-risk" stu-
dents, including those 
who never actually use 
OA .LS. Such a system is 
analogous to basing fund-
ing for Preuss SChool on 
how all low-income, poten-
tia lly firs t-generation col-
lege students in an Diego 
County perform on state 

tests - whether those stu-
dents actually attend Preuss 
School or not. 

This page is definitely not 
opposed to a performance-
based funding mechanism 
for O ,A.S.I,S., but only as 
long as it is based on actu-
al performance measure-
ments. It seems reasonable 
that the center's funding be 
based on two factors : how 
many eligible students actu-
ally use the service and how 
the students that do use it 
perform in classes. 

Perversely, the current 
formula attempts to com-
bine the two in such a way 
that appears to make little 
practical sense, Of course, 
It'S quite possible that there 
is some hidden logic behind 
the funding mecnanism. In 
that case, nowever, campus 
administrators owe the fee-
paying students of this cam-
pus the information neces-
sary to understand it. 

It's unfortunate that th ey 
have, up until now, failed to 
offer that information,

Job market what students make of it 
Excellent tools available to UCSD job-seekers 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Opinion Editor 

For many college students 
- and especially the class of 
2005, which has mere weeks left 
at UCSD - their imminent entry 
into the working world is tinged 
with despair. Questions abound: 
"Will my skills cut it against my 
competitors for jobs?" "Will any-
one hire me?" "Will [ earn a 
decent salary in my area of inter-
est?" 

At UCSD, there is a profound 
cynicism about the job prospects 
students will face after college. 
The tougher a person's major, the 
more dismal he or she thinks life 
will be after college. And those 
who studied the humanities? 
Forget it - they'll be lucley to 
make $50 a day panhandling in 
front of Ralphs, or so the belief 
goes. 

Luckily, our doomsday pre-
dictions for the working world 
don't correspond to today's real-
ity. Data gathered by the National 
Association of Colleges and 
Employers shows that dIe class 
of 2004-05 will find "an increase 
in both the number of compa-
nies hiring new graduates and 
the number of people these com-
panies would be hjring." They 
should expect a 4-percent increase 
in starting salaries, to boot. 

If those numbers don 't seem 
convinci ng, according to C ra ig 
Schmidt, assistant director of the 
Career D evelopment Program at 
UCSD , students' paranoia about 

the job market is just that - para-
noia. Schmidt describes the job 
market as dipping from 2000 to 
2004, but says "things have begun 
to turn around," and in his office 
he's seen a heartening sign - stu-

" lolrseekers lacking 
practical experience 

in their field, 
interpersonal skills ar 

critical 
thinking skills wiU 

always have 
problems shining 

during job 
interviews and 

exceUing in jobs, no 
matter how 

impressive their 
degrees, " 

dents coming in seeking advice on 
how to handle multiple job offers 
and salary negotiations. UCSD 
has also seen an increase in the 
number of employers recruiting 
students at campu job fair. 

So fear not, UCSD graduates 

- up to a poin~. Job-seekers 
lacking practical experience in 
their field, interpersonal skills or 
critical thinking skills will always 
have problems shining during job 
interviews and excelling in jobs, 
no matter how impressive their 
degrees. Unfortunately, many 
UCSD students seem to forget 
this crucial detail, putting their 
noses to the academic grindstone 
for four years, mistakenly think-
ing a stellar GP1\ is all they need 
to waltz into their dream job 
after college. It may be surprising 
to some that Schmidt cites inter-
personal communication skills, 
ability to work on a team and 
problem-solving skills as prime 
qualities employers seek in new 
hires. It should be less surpris-
ing that UCSD students, as a 
whole, need to grow in terms of 
the interpersonal skills we bring 
to the workplace. Luckily, pro-
grams like Express to Success 
explicitly seek to correct this 
problem, but a relatively tiny 
percentage of UCSD students 
use this program. Why? Crushed 
by classes, we don't have time 
- and this focus on academics at 
the expense of everything else is 
the root of the problem, 

As Schmidt describes it, 
UCSD is "a highly theoreti -
cal and academic institution"; 
the classes here are compel -
ling and time-consuming, bu t 
when college is over and all 
academic requirements are met,

Jobs: UCSD's failings must be minimized 
continued from page 4 

heing smart is not enough . It's a 
given that anyone with a UCSD 
degree is smart, and a high CPA 
can reveal a n umber of th ings 
- that your majo r did n 't chal-
lenge you, that you worked hard, 
that yo u enj oyed you r area of 
study, that you m astered the art 
of ch ea ting, that you found a 
genius-caliber study buddy. It 's 
not an indication of a good stu -
dent or a good empl oyee any 
more than your blood type is a 
test of your health; othe rwise 
the job application and interview 
process could be replaced by 
the presentation o f one's college 
transcript. 

The great shortcoming of too 
many UCSD students is that 
they don't know what employ-
ers want and don't put much 
stock in being a well -rounded 
employee, focusing instead on 
the academic hamster wheel and 
graduating with little or no job 
experience or hands-on practical 
experience in their area of i nter-
est. It's a self-defeating strategy 
not hel ped a bi t by professors 
who teach based on the assump-
tion that their classes are all we 
should care about . 

But professors alone can't 
be blamed for all the people 
who emerge from college with 
degrees but no marketable 
skills or job experience. Nor 
can Career Services be blamed 
for not getting the word out to 
students about the importance 
of internships, student research 
opportunities and other invalu-
able opportunities for students 
to gajn the necessary practical 
skills and on-the-job experience, 
because they do get the word 
out. According to Schmidt, 90 
percent of UCSD students use 
Career Services in some capac-

ity before they graduate, even 
if it's imply registeri ng on Porr 
Triton. 

Perhaps all UCS D students 
need is a reality check. The power 
of a UCS D diploma shoul dn't be 
un deres timated - si mply being 
a UCS D graduate sets us apart 
from job-seekers from lesser uni -
versities - but it shouldn 't be 
ove restimated , either, because 
grades alone don't , and shouldn 't , 
give anyone a free ride to the 
premi er ranks of Qualcomm or 
Microsoft. 

" A curriculum 
that tends toward 

the overly 
thearetical is 
sometimes 

compounded by 
complacent students 
who do nothing to 
make P f. 't " U Jar I .. ' 

To those stressing about find-
ing a decent job out of college, 
the statistics should be comfort-
ing: college graduates typically 
stay at their first job only one or 
two year~, and people typically 
switch jobs eight to 10 times 
and careers three to four times 
throughout their lives, accord-
ing to Schmidt. That is, even if 
you end up hating your job at 
Enterprise Rent-A-Car (one of 
the foremost employers of newly 
minted college grads) or your 
career as an electrical engineer, 

you ca n, and should neve r hesi-
tate to, switch. Remember the 
fra ntic and num erous cha nges 
in majors most students make 
- o ne week biology, the next 
music, one month art , the next 
ph ysics? T he real-worl d jumping 
between jobs and careers mirror 
thi s constant change mo re th an 
we tend to think . 

Year after year, UCSD gradu-
ates criticize our weak interper-
sonal skills, and programs like 
Express to Success aggressively 
advertise themselves in an efforr ro 
make up for this shortcoming. But 
does the problem lie with the edu-
cation UCSD students are receiv-
ing, or with the students them-
selves? A curriculum that tends 
roward the overly theoretical is 
sometimes compounded by com-
placent students who do nothing 
to make up for it, choosing instead 
to complain about the content of 
their classes. Needless to say, this 
is not the way to malc.e the most 
out of one's university education 
or out of one's lot in life. Some 
UCSD graduates even emerge 
from college with sub-par English 
language skills. As the cream of 
the intellectual crop, we UCSD 
students owe it to ourselves to do 
better. 

At some point, the responsibil-
ity must. fall on students - for 
if we have problel115 finding a 
job after college, scapegoat-
ing our professors or classes is 
futile. UCSDs faculty and staff 
can impart knowledge about their 
respective fields, but they can't 
hold our hands in all respects, and 
they won't fill out job applications 
or help us ace job interviews when 
the time comes. 

In the end, UCSD graduates 
have no excuse to do anything 
but shine in the burgeoning job 
market. 

OPINION 5 

~ I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Prof's teaching style 
didn't justify firing 

Dear Editor: 
I am a fo rmer student of pro-

fessor Wei Wnng, who was fired 
by th e C hinese de par tment in 
J anuary 2005. My understanding 
is that professor Wang was fi red 
beca use of h is approach to teach-
ing th e Chinese language, an 
approach th at was different rhan 
what was dic tated by the head 
of the Chinese department at 
the rime, professor Ping C hang 
Hu. If that is the case, I feel that 
an abuse of power has occured 
in the Chinese department at 
UCSD . 

I have the experience of hav-
ing had both Wang and Hu as 
Chinese language teachers. Both 
exhibited a great deal of knowl-
edge of the Chinese language , 
but had their differences in 
how they approached teaching 
it. Hu focused more on gram-
mar whereas Wang focused more 
on conversation. I feel that the 
two different methods actually 
complement each other in bring-
ing a broader understanding of 
Chinese . Wang's class was much 
more enjoyable, though, since he 
interacted more with hjs students 
and brought a much more amia-
ble atmosphere to the class versus 
the competitive nature that is felt 
in most college courses. 

Different teaching meth-
ods should be applauded, not

repressed . If every professor of a 
certa in field o f study approached 
the material the same way, the 
professors would become like 
robots mechanically disseminat-
ing information . Wang was a 
great teacher and helped me learn 
a great deal about the Chinese 
language. I feel that that the 
Chinese department's dismissal 
of Wang is an egregious abuse 
of power and that the professor 
should be reinstated.

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSD.A.Y. MAY 26. 2005 

Summer marks kickoff of the interview dating game 
Great 
Expectations 

Carol Freire 

A s the academic year melts into summer vacation, some of us prepare to catch up on 
our astronomical sleep-debt, and 
some of us prepare to join the mass 
of salaried minions ; college isn't 
cheap, after all. Unless you are self-
employed or planning on running 
for San Diego mayor, this mea ns 
interviews. Actually, since elections 
could be seen as a form of pub-
lic interview, and start-ups often 
require bank loans, that leaves only 
the fabulously rich immune from 
any son of interview - and there 
are many sortS. 

There's the traditional one-on-
one interview, 'the stre s interview, 
the board interview and the group 
interview. We have interviews for 
medical school, graduate school, 
temp jobs. real jobs. council posi-
tions, roommates, lab 199s ... It's 
a catch-all entrance ritual for any-
thing in Western society. 

I've successfully completed three 
group interviews in the last three 
years. One to be a resident advisor, 

SAN DIEGO 

one to be a Student Health advo-
cate, and one, the summer after my 
freshman year, for the glorious job 
of Target cashier (?!). If you haven't 
experienced it yet, the group inter-
view is perhaps one of the most 
uncomfortable evaluation devices 
invented. You are given a menial 
metaphorical task or thought-exer-
cise ro accomplish with a group of 
your peers that resembles noth-
ing close to any work situation 
you will subsequently encounter. 
Ostensibly, it shows interviewers 
how well you will work with your 
future co-workers. In reality, you 
are face-to-face with your direct 
competition, fighting to get a word 
in thc discussion. You want to DC 
succinct, eloquent, and lIoticed 
- but you don't want to obnox-
iously dominate the conversation . 
You whip out the pen and orga-
ni ze the group to show leadership. 
Each helpful idea that you posit is 
one less that your competition can 
bring up, and in the end, everyone 
who gets a job did so through face-
to-face combat. No wonder we 
have so many corporate sharks. 

On campus, you are most likely 
to encounter the panel interviews. 
Unless you screw up royally, they 
will all likely forget your answers 
and leave with vague positive or 
negative impressions. T he best 

Science and Technology Council 

way to understand interviews is to 
cond uct them, and this was one 
great oppornmity of which I took 
advantage while serving in student 
council and other extracurriculars. 
Everyone has read the same inter-
viewing tips, and so the candi-
date pool evens out to a monotone 
hum. Picking out the differences 
is a nuanced task, as the candidate 
who is exceptionally talented or 
exceptionally lousy, is well, rare. 
Everyone knows to dress up, but 
not overdo the make-up. Everyone 
knows the "worst weakness" ques-
tion is supposed to be spin-doc-
rored into a quality. Everyone tries 
to say what the interviewer wants 
to hear, and the onl y excitement 
comes when the candidate misjudg-
es what that is. One candidate for 
the RA position said he was "very 
idealistic" and described his und er-
standing of the job as essentially 
alcohol undercover detective. RAs 
ca n't go snooping into peo ple's 
unattended apartments, and "very 
idealistic" to me meant, "hard to 
work with." All in all though, the 
interview is a poor way to judge 
how someone will perform their 
job, but we seem to keep it around 
simply because we haven't thought 
of something better. 

According to nonfiction author 
Malcolm Gladwell, there are twO 

things interviewers can tell from the 
snap judgment they will make upon 
meeting a candidate: Whether the 
candidate is an extrovert or intro-
vert, and whether the candidate is 
sexually attractive. Perhaps those are 
not the best considerations to enter-
tain when awarding jobs. Mind you, 
these are not always conscious judg-
mentS, but you would be surprised 
to sec how much people stick to 
these initial first impressions, later 
rationalizing their decisions and 
gathering evidence for a self-fulfill-
ing prophecy. In general, the initial 
assessment is left unchanged. 

In his book "Blink," Gladwell 
celebrates rapid cogni tion , but 
some readers have overlooked 
his careful analysi of its pitfall s. 
Gladwell posits the Warren G. 
Harding effect, or the dark side of 
rapid cognition. Harding was a very 
tall , distinguished-looking man and 
an extremely mediocre president. 
He advanced from local politics 
despite himself, partly pushed by 
hi wife Florence Harding and his 
friend Harry Daugherty, partly rid-
ing on his electable looks . Voters 
sized him up and concluded tha t hi 
height and extraordinary good looks 
meant he had courage, intelligence 
and integrity. "It's why picking the 
right candidate for a job is so dif-
fic ult and why, on more occasions 

For more than 50 years, the United States has maintained its global economic edge by being better than 
any other country at discovering new knowledge, inventing new technologies and exploiting their 
commercial value. Today, according to surveys done by organizations such as the National Intelligence 
Council, American dominance is slipping as Asian countries increase their investments in R&D and 
challenge our role as innovation leader - particularly China. Please join the San Diego Science and

than we may care to admit, utte r 
mediocrities sometimes end up in 
positions of enormous responsibil -

Depending on your competence 
and physical attributes, this coul d be 
good or bad news. There is Ii ttle we 
can do about increasing our height, 
but maybe we can change the set-
ting in which jobs are awarded. The 
interview is what we are used to, but 
tradi tion isn't immutable. 

The interview, in essence, is a 
hot date. Some people don't speak, 
they beam, and their sheer excite-
ment is contagious and spellbind-
ing. You can't help but give the 
person with sparkling eyes the job. 
You 'll even forgive their little slip-
ups if they're interesting and eager 
to please yOIl. Interviewi ng sel f-
help books usually dwell on the 
answers, which m~tter. granted. but 
their canned answers make people 
sound phony. Sounding phony is 
the sure-fire way to lose a date. 
Since the interview revolution isn' t 
likely to happen this month, wc' lI 
just have to play the interview dat-
ing game. So good luck with your 
hot summer dates, and may they 
prove profitable.

UPTE: University threatens legal action 
continued from page I 

despi te having the money to do so. 
"[The strike] is a statement," 

Buckmaster said. "The university 
should nor refu e us the money." 

UC Office of the President 
spokesman Noel Van Nyhuis said 
that the union's allegations are 
" i ncorrect. tt 

"State funding is [the universi-
ty'sl single largest source of fund-
ing, and as such, is what governs 
the university's abilty to give wage 
increases," he said. "Because of the 
state financial crisis ... the uni-
versity has not been able to offer 
systemwide wage increases the past 
two years." 

The union has charged that 
the university has taken part in 
bad-faith bargaining by withhold-
ing university financial information 
from the negotiation process as 
well as retaliating against union 
activists, according to a UPTE 
stri ke notice. 

"The university'S persistent bad 
faith has provoked direct action and 
strike activity as the only avenue 
available to UPTE-represented 
employees to ... obtain meaningful 
bargaining in genuine pursuit of a 
negotiated agreement," the notice 
stated. 

Van Nyhuis said the university 
has been doing its part to avert the 
strike. 

"The university has been bar-
gaining on good faith," he said. 
"We felt we made substantial prog-
ress over the past few weeks. We 
are doing everything on our side of 
the bargain agreement. All offers 
are not being reciprocated by the 
union." 

In particular, the union has criti-

cized the ability of the university to 
retain research staff. 

The turnover rate - the fre-
quency with which staff leave the 
university - has reached "cri-
sis" proportions, with an annual 
rate of 33 percent, according to 
Buckmaster. She said that the rate 
severely limits research at UCSD 
because it takes several months to 
train new research assistants. 

"The university is becoming a 
revolving door for researchers, and 
it is not a beneficial long-term 
approach," Buckmaster said. "They 
are running a busi ness ra ther than 
an educational institution, and it is 

" The university has been bargaining on good faith . 
... AU offers are not 

being reciprocated by the

detrimental to students." 
A UPTE press release has stated 

that the union has fi led several com-
plaints with the California Public 
Employees Relations Board. On 
Apri l 19, CPERB found that the 
university "illegally refused to pro-
vide information to UPTE about 
turnover savings." 

Van Nyhuis said that the charg-
es are "withou t fou ndation" and 
that the union is using them as an 

excuse to strike. 
"[The union] is using it as pres-

sure for higher wages," he said. "Tt 
is just a smoke creen to put pres-
sure on the university." 

Because negotiations are sti II 
going on and no neutral state medi-
ator has been included in the pro-
cess. the university has deemed the 
planned strike unlawful and is now 
considering filing legal actions with 
CPERB, according to Van Nyhuis. 

"The university believes the 
strike will be illegal because the 
university and UPTE are engaged 
in ongning negotiations and 
have not completed the statuto-
rily mandated impasse process," 
UCSD Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Human Resources Rogers Davis 
stated in a campuswide e-mail. 

A spokesman for CPERB was 
unavailable for comment. 

Each of the UC campuses and 
the university's medical centers 
will take the necessary steps to 
ensure normal operations during 
the strike, Van Nyhuis said. 

In a meeting with representatives 
in mid-May, the university has pro-
posed incremental aero s-the-board 
wage increases, ranging between 1.5 
and 4 percent, each year for rwo 
years. 

Yet the proposed changes fall 
short of UPTE's demands, which 
call for a 2.83 percent increase effec-
tive 2004-05, and 7.76 and 4.8 per-
cent increases for the following rwo 
years, respectively. 

University and UPTE represen-
tatives plan to meet in early June to 
continue bargaining.

'The Threepenny Opera' combines 
the avant-garde with the vulgar 
Graduate students direct a stripped down, 

modern adaptation of Brecht's offbeat cabaret 
By MEHRDAD YAZDANI 

Staff Writer 

The Threepenny Opera" was one of the key plays to secure the important reputations of play-
wright BertoltBrech t (with he.lp from 
mistress Elisabeth H auptman. whom 
history has conveniently igno red) 
and composer Kurt Weill in the the-
ater world. Artistically, it is a work 
that entertains and provokes the 
audience with its c ri tique on bour-
geois society. Thi year the UCSD 
music deparonent will present a son 
of stripped-down, updated version 
of "Threepenny" :It the Che Cafe. 
Graduate students ick DeMaison, 
Rick Burkhardt and Andy Gricevich 
contrived the idea and directed the 
play and music. The original play 
was a criti cal and commercial success 
in late ) 920s Germany, just before 
the rise of Hitler. 

The main crux of the play, 
which reflectl industrial societies 
such as Germany itself, is per-
haps best described by philo~ophy 
student and co-director Gri ccvich, 
who said, "A lot of things tha tare 
thought of as crim e are, at bonom, 
business, and on the other hand 
most of what's thought of as busi-
ness is basically cri me." 

For example, one of the main 
heroes, Mac the Knife, is the anti-
hero: a pimp, thief and murder-
er. The play is filled with crime 
and poverty and the reaction of 
the m iddle class to these events. 
Naturally, this ch aracteristic was 
a shock for 1920s Germany, con-
tributing to the pla y's com;ncrcial 
success . 

The role of th e anti -hero, how-
ever, has been played au{ in our 
times, and thus the original play has 
lost somt:! of Its shock value. After 
all, what young person doesn 't have 
a favorite gangsta r apper to look up 
to) With this in mind, composition 
student, translator and co-director 
Burkhart has cranked up the crude 
language and sexually sugges-
tive scenes. His translation sparks 
wi th 2 1st-century oomph. lie has, 
however, kept the main essence of 
Brecht's work intact. 

Brecht is a towering fi gure in 
20th-century Germa n thea te r. 

H e and Weill shared dissatisfac-
tion with the status of theater in-
Weimar Germ any. T hey were sick 
of high art in German society and 
the upper-middle class it was tai-
lored to. Thus, instead of providing 
the typical contemporary atonal 
music one expects from serious 
works, the music of "Threepenny" 
is in the low-art style of cabaret 
music. 

W eil l is best known fo r musi-
ca l soundtracks. DeMaison, a 
composition grad uate student , 
arra nged We ill's I11U ic for an 
ense mble of six musicians , instead 
of the original 15. Weill's music in 
"Threepenny," in a style of 19205 
German cabaret, reflects the bluc-
coll ar banality of that lifestyle. On 
the o ther hand, the music is strong 
enough to transcend these nega-
tive attributes and is surprisingl y 
listenable. Weill's arrangement of 
such simpleminded music is over 
the top and sniffy. but Dl!Mai,un's 
tri pped-down version m<l kes th e 

music a lot more enjoyable. Of 
course, Weill intended the 111llSlC 
to be o~er the top and lame, mock-
ing the exces ive lifestyle of the 
bourgeoisie tha t the play cri t1Cil.C,. 

The combination of musIC lnd 
theater often signals to American 
audiences the stereotypical "musi-
ca l sou nd ," but "Threepenny" pre-
dates the time when th e genre 
was milked dry in post- W orld 
War II Hollywood. Weill's music, 
although highly acces ible and 
"popular" in s tyle, can be easily 
app reciated by high-art enthusiasts. 
De,V1 aison sees Amer ican l1lu~ l cal s 
as weak in compa ri son. 

" I think the problem with a lot 
of Amcrican musicals i, tlut the\' 
want to be high art, but til l!. want to 
appeal to evcrylXldy and are caught 
in this awkward , horrible middle 
ground of really awful everything," 
he said. Weill's music lacks thcse 
pretensions . 

This combination of 'v eill's 
low-art music with Brecht 's cyni -
cal c ritique and sati re on capitalist 
society makes "The Threepenny 
Opera" a fun and di srurbing study 
of humankind . "The T hreepenny 
Opera" will play at the Che Cafe 
May 27 at 8 p.m. 

Regeneration: Provocative art 
influenced by Western movements 

continued from page 8 
characters that look Chinese, but are 
in fact a mixture of E nglish, Islamic 
and Chinese text. The furnituse that 
completes her installation has been 
reconstructed from Chinese Ming 
style and French Louis XV chairs. 

Chen Lingyang plays on the 
long-established metaphor of women 
as flowers in "The Twelve Flower 
Months, tt a trio of color photographs 
that uses the artist's own body as the 
subject. Floral imagery is directly 
juxtaposed with images of a naked 
body and a pristine trickle of blood 
running down a pale inner thigh . 
Lingyang subverrs the metaphor by 
examining it through the physiologi-
cal reaHry of menstruation. 

Other artists have undercurrents 
of violence and abuse in their works. 
Xu Zhen's video, "Rainbow," focuses 
on the artist's naked back against a 
plain white background. The audio 
counterpart plays a repetitive, loud 
and violent slapping sound. Though 
you never see who is abusing him, 
Zhen's back shows a wide spectrum 
of colors along with the imprints 
of fingers and hands. Zhou Liang's 
"Bored Youth" stays consistent in 
demollStrating this theme of vio-
lence by following a teenager at night 
through an abandoned neighbor-

hood and capturing the aggressive 
images and sounds or him destroying 
windowpanes. The video's creepy 
soundtrack and green-hued images 
lends a disturbing quality to the art-
work. 

Other artists' work has been 
heavil y influenced by Western 
movements such as surrealism 
and dadaism. Zhang Xiaogang's oil 
painting, "No. 14," shows a young 
man's vapid face resting on a book 
with his eyes shut. Muted colors 
and symbols Scattered in the paint-
ing are reminiscent of Salvador Dal i 
and Rene Magritte's works. Many 
of these Western influences have 
been seen in avant-garde Chinese art 
since the country was "opened up" to 
Western ideas and movemen ts after 
the Cultural Revolution. 

Overall, the exhibit's body of 
work represents a revitalization of 
contemporary life and culnlre in 
China. "Regeneration" is a stimu-
lating break from end-of-the-quar-
ter-stress, as the various provocative 
pieces take you through a variety 
of media, moods and emotions. 
"Regeneration" will be on di play 
through July 2. 1ne University Art 
Gallery is open Tuesday though 
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m .

Out Hud 
Let Us Never Speak of 

It Again 
Kranky 

***~ 
Sometime about 12 years ago, all the people that wcre into rock music 
stopped dancing to it. (I 
don't' mcan balls-stapled-
to-a-can-of-Aqua-Ncl-rock 
music, bccause no one evcr 
did anything but stomp on 
Pabst Blue Ribbon empties 
listening to that.) The kind 
of rock that began with "24 
Hour Party People" subjects 
Joy Division, New Order 
and the Happy Mondays 
started many a dance party in 
the shameless '80s, onl y to be 

replaced by the modern rock 
"nod" we know and love. 

Danceable rock does 
exist: The DFA production 
team represents the raw 
punk end of the spectrum, 
and bands such as I!! and Out 
Hud (which happen to share 
three members and a kin-
dred style) represent the beat 
'n' bass end. Where !!I are 
hard and impersonal, relying 
on throbbing drum textures, 
Out Hud feast upon the 
!!! bass style and their own 
Stratocaster ecstasy, piecing 
together the all-too-familiar 
instruments into seemingly 
trance-infonned dance-rock 
with real instruments. Each 
member of the five-piece 
shifts from instrument to 
instrwnent to mixing board, 
basking ig the warm glow 
of the drum machine, chim-
ing in with pretty and plain 
feminine vocals. They are 
always immaculately pre-
cise, at home in a bedroom 
(60 dB) or while grinding 
against fellow indie rockers 
in thc club (100 dB). Out 
Hud will perfonn June I at 
the Casbah.

The Boy Least 
Likely To 

The Best Party Ever 
Too Young To Die 

F ur so soft ithurtsl Fur too soft for words," moans the glisteny-sweet vocal-
istJof on "Fur Soft as Fur," a 
single off his band's adorably 
titled debut, 77u Bm PlI1ty 
EVtT. It's a perfect line, not 
just fo r the song, but because 
it balances all the precarious 
ironies of his rootsy, lament-
fuI twee-pop into one irUlo-
cent little couplet. "Too soft 
for words," indeed - the 
harmonies of wistful Jof plus 
the high country-munch-

kin quotient of Pete's lush 
instrumentation (miniature 
woodsmen magica lly oper-
ate banjo, glockenspiel and 
piano) give these jangly pop 
tunes the unabashed bright-
ness of Belle and Sebastian 
with that nifty country-folk! 
California-harmony hybrid 
thing the Thrills couldn't 
quite pull off. 

But J of's incredulous 
words tell a story belied by 
the singer's golden refrains. 
A child sees both joy and 
sorrow with wider eyes, and 
::he album bumbles cleverly 
on the simultaneous juxtapo-
si tion of sweet melody and 
somber rumination. Despite 
the fact dlat "the little things 
that used to make us happy 
made us sad," the disap-
pointed road-trip ditty "I'm 
Glad I Hitched My Apple 
Wagon to Your Star" bounc-
es with an irresistably inno-
cent abandon. "I'm happy if 

you~re happy but it breaks 
my hem," the song realizes. 
It seems like an impossibly 
romantic contradiction, but 
those are just what the Boy 
Least Likely To do best.

Horns and Halos 

Million Dollar Dream 

*** 

Andre Nickatina and Equipto, San Francisco's hip-hop odd couple, 
have established something 
of a cult following after the 
underground success of their 
first collaboration, Midnight 
Machine Gun Rhymes. Both 
rappers have released less-
than-stellar solo albums 
since Midnight, and fans of 
the two have been eagerly 
awaiting a new duo release. 

Horns and Halos picks up 
where the last left off, with 

hard beats incorporating 
samples from va rious genres 
of music, from rock to soul 
and even to more unusual 
(for hip-hop) world music. 
Nickatina 's and Equipto's 
contrasting styles fit together 
well on tracks like "Heelz" 
and "Holla 4 Madonna," 
but certain songs have mel-
lowed-out production that 
doesn't align with either 
rapper's lyrical delivery. 

The two usually sound 
good together, but on this 
a1bwn, it is the songs they 
perform solo that truly 
stand out. "2BU" and "Git 
Down," by Nickatina and 
Equipto, respectively, are 
perfectly produced for each 
rapper, creating songs that 
epitomize why both have 
strong solo careers. 

This album is a nec-
essary addition to any 
Nickatina fan's collection, 
but something is missing. 
Any momentum gained is 
quickly slowed by several 
weak, disappointing tracks. 
'Tbis one simply eems too 
smoked out, lacking the fire 
of previous efforts.

Hawkinson is one of the most

His work on show in a New

be insta lled at UCSD is a replica 
of the bear that Hawkinson cre-
ated with pebbles a few years ago, 
featuring the artist's first perma -
nent outdoor public project - a 
20-foot-tall bear constructed out 
of eight naturally formed granite 
boulders, mimicking sculptures of 
prehistoric time. 

In addition, the Museum of 
Contemporary Art is looking 
beyond its territory with ambi-
tious expansion plans for fall 2006. 
Not conforming to mediocre stan-
dards, the museum commissioned 
the best in every respect, hiring 
architect Wayne Donaldson, in \ 
addition to Richard Gluckman 
of Gluclcman Mayner Architects, 
a New York company famous 
for its renovations of industrial 
spaces into magnificent art ven-
ues, including the Andy Warhol 
Museum in Pittsburgh, the Dia 
Center in New York, the Picasso 
Museum in Spain and a number 
of the most respected galleries of 
Chelsea, England. The transfor-

mati on of the historic Santa Fe 
Depot "baggage building," pro-
viding over 10,000 square feet of 
exhibition space, will accompany 
the new contemporary building 
that will be attached to it. A 
site-specific sculpture by Serra 
will be installed in front of the 
new downtown space, and a Jenny 
Holzer piece will work to bridge 
the two spaces. 

The new MCASD spl!ce will 
include a studio for artist-in-res-
idence Robert Irwin, a special 
gallery space dedicated to and 
equipped for the presentation of 
multimedia works. The new glass 
and steel stnlCture, referencing 
railroads with its red color, will 
also house a lecture hall with a 
capacity of 130 people, utcnsive 
educational areas and administra-
tive spaces for the museum, along 
with art handling and art prepara-
tion spaces and a board confer-
ence room,

for commissioning large install a-

ists each year in coll aboration 
with the Massachusetts Museum

continued from page I 
benchmark to assess the universi ty's 
hiring practices, according to a state-
ment released by the UC Office 
of the President in response to the 
report. According to ucop, the 
applicant pool of women for poten-
tial faculty positions vary by each 
deparnnenr as well as by the differ-
ent levels of hiring at the junior or 
senior level. 

Determining the level and field 
of new faculty hires is the product 
of a complex academic planning 
process that takes place at the cam-
pus level, UCOP stated. 

West and several others began to 
raise concems over the hiring issue 
through the California Legislarure. 
She and her colleagues approached 
state Senator Jackie Speier CD-San 
Francisco/San Mateo), who held 
hearings during three consecutive 
years in 2001, 2002 and 2003 to 
track UC hiring practices. The 
report also details the testimonies 
of professors from various cam-
puses during the hearings. 

"If the discrimination continues, 
we would lose a whole genera-
tion of women faculty," 'West said. 
"We're worried that the percentage 
of women hired will go baCK down 
unless attention continues to be 
paid to the issue." 

At the 2001 hearing, faculty 
reported that UCSD had the low-
est number of women in its faculty 
among the UC campuses, with 17 
percent of professors being women. 

Since then, the campus has 
improved, but not by much, accord-
ing to UCSD ethnic srudies profes-
sor Ross Frank, who chairs the 
Committee on Affirmative Action 
for the campus' Academic Senate. 

"We have a horrible record," 
Frank said. "Maybe it's been getting 
better, but not by much. Where we 
are now, things haven't changed, 
and more dramatic things must be 
done at the different levels of hiring 

for the Ue." 
UCSD history professor 

Michael Bernstein testified in 2002 
about women in the history depart-
ment and how the strucrure of 
the search process prevented an 
increase in the number of females 
hired. While Bernstein said that the 
situation in the history department 
has improved since his testimony, 
with two additional women senior 
faculty and many more as associate 
professors, the university must con-
tinue to monitor the problem. 

"I think [the report] represents a 
long period of gathering information 
that shows lagging efforts to solve 
a systemwide problem," Bernstein 
said. "We also need to imprDVl! out-
reach so that more women come 
into the undergraduate and graduate 
programs that provide the pool of 
qualified professors." 

The report found some improve-
ment in the hiring of women for 
nontenured assistant-professor 
positions. It stated that the per-
cemage of women among assistant 
professor hires went up from 38 
percent in 2002 -03 to 41 percent 
the following year. 

. But the report also showed that 
the progress of women being hired 
throughout the UC system contin-
ues to be mixed. While UC Berkeley 
has the highest percentage of women 
hires at 48 percent of new faculty, 
the other UC campuses continue 

to lag. In 2004, UCSD still had the 
lowest percentage of women faculty, 
with 22 percent, compared to 27 
percent systemwide. 

Among the recommendations 
given in the report are providing 
more university leadership by com-
municating directly with academic 
departments, disseminating data on 
hiring information from the past 
years to each faculty member, and 
expanding the percentage of faculty 
hired at the entry level of assistant 
professors. 

"We need chancellors and the 
[UC] president to communicate 
directly to every department's facul-
ty," West said. "They need to send 
letters to each department [saying] 
that we need to hire women in that 
field." 

Ross also said that leadership 
changes must be combined with 
efforts to change the way faculty 
members understand the benefits 
of a diversified faculty. 

"The faculty as a whole has 
to understand that you can't have 
excellence and not take advantage 
of the full pool in any discipline," 
Ross said. "We now have to worK 
at not only encouraging leadership 
but also devising ways of changing 
the culture of faculty who acrually 
are the ones malcing decisions."

EASTERN CONFERENCE 

FINALS 
MIAMI HEAT VS. 

DETROIT PISTONS 

Did either of these teams even 
have to play any other series) 
Did this not become a preor-
dained matchup the instant Shaq 
traded Hollywood bling for a 
Miami g-string? 

No, not really. Even those 
who say they saw this coming 
aJl along are probably full of it. 
Nobody could have Known at 
the start of the season just how 
complete a team Miami would 
really be. Nobody would have 
said that while Kobe Bryant 
couldn't even make the play-
offs without Shaq, Heat guard 
Dwayne Wade would be able to 
sweep a series without him. The 
truth, cliched as it is, is that Shaq 
changes the game, especially in 

the playoffs. Unforrunately, so 
far we have not seen Shaq in this 
year's playoffs. With Shaq, the 
Heat can dominate completely 
and play with anybody. Without 
Shaq, they've still shown that 
they are an elite and competitive 
force, even in playoff basketball. 
Sure, the Pistons had a scare last 
round, falling behind 2-1 to the 
depleted Indiana Pacers, but any 
weaKnesses shown in that series 
will be hard to exploit again, 
especially without at least 90 per-
cent of Big Daddy Diesel stand-
ing tall in the center. However,

enough for second all-time at 
UCSD, trailing only fellow senior 
Keith Hernandez, who has 85. 

At the clean-up spot, Morehead

117 total bases while hitting .359. 
Defensively, he threw out 13 base

Lawson recorded 12 assists from 
the outfield while contributing offen-
sively with a .335 batting average, 
including a league-high nine triples 
as well as 19 doubles and three home 
runs. The speedy Lawson also led 
the team in stolen bases with 21 . 

Granted: ·Money acts as token of appreciation

by the student? 
Most varsity sports have about 

a four-month-Iong schedule, dur-
ing which time it is common for 
athletes to practice three hours 
or more each day. Weekends are 
typically a blur of tournaments, 
travel and homework, with rest 
and a limited social life filling in 
whatever is left. Fit a job into the 
scheme, then realize that though 
the season ends, practice for next 
season starts immediately. 

The scholarship is only incen-
tive enough to push a student 
athlete who is not likely to receive 
any scholarship money elsewhere 
to come to UCSD, assuming 
that is the only thing affecting 
the student's decision. It is not 
enough to convince an athlete to 
change his or her collegiate plans; 
it is not enough to taint the proud 
academic reputation of UCSD; it 
is not enough to pay most student 
athletes' rent for one month, let 
alone the full four months of an 

athletic season. 
Five hundred dollars is virru-

ally nothing. It is literally a few 
hours of extra time that a student 
will be able to buy him- or herself 
during the season. 

" [The scholarship] is 
not enough to taint the 
proud academic Tepu, 
tation of UCSD; it is 

not enough to pay most 
student athletes' Tent 
far one month ... " 

Athletic scholarships have a 
reputation as salaries for srudent 
athletes who 1Ife not expected to 
go to class. 

While this may be valid in 
other cases, offering a token of 

appreciation to a small number of 
Division IT athletes who consis-
tently prove themselves academi-
cally superior to the rest of the 
student body is hardly compara-
ble. The money will mean a great 
deal more to student athletes than 
the lip service that they are so 
often paid . 

UCSD needs to get over its 
no-athletic-scholarship legacy. 
The school's administration has 
to realize that if it is to grow as 
an academic powerhouse, then it 
has to expect pressure to expand 
those programs associated with 
campus life, including athlet-
ics. The new NCAA Division IT 
regulations serve to balance the 
other 284 member schools. If this 
were an issue of pride, as it has 
been in previous years - where 
UCSD chooses to honor its sru-
dents before its athletes - then 
it would be conceivable to reject 
Watson's proposal. But in the face 
of universal change, it is ludicrous 
to abstain from progress.

NCAA I snubs Tritons 
after first CCAA title 
Baseball misses out on 2005 
NCAA Division II tourney 
========== South Division behind Cal Poly 

the sports 

Jlael Enteen 

I t was a dream come true, a Cinderella story and a comeback for the qes. It was 
UC D's first California Collegiate 
Athletic Association baseball 
championship and it could not 
have been more spectacular. After 
losing their first game in a dou-
ble-elimination tournament, in a 
lose-and-go-home simation, the 
Tritons stepped up their game 
and beat the tournament favor-
ite and regular season champion 
Chico State Wildcats twice, both 
in extra innings, to win the title. 
'The Triton stood proud on top of 
the CCAA, king of their respective 
mountain, untouchable, unbeat-
able and unbreabblc. So what 
could turn their dream season into 
a nightmare? What could keep 
them from riding their momen-
tum to the top of the upcoming 
NCM Division II tournament? 
How about being snubbed by 
the CAA and missing out on 
the opportunity to prove to the 
nation that their CCAA title was 
no fluke? -

Well, the nightmare became 
a reality for the Tritons, who, 
thanks to the geniuses in the 

CM selection committee, will 
be staying home while the team 
they beat twice in a row gets to 
play ball in the tournament. If 
this makes sense to you, then 
please explain it to me. Stop me 
from going Dennis Miller on the 

CM and ranting to my heart's 
content. However, if you feel that 
the NCAA has a bias against the 
Tritons worse than the prejudice 
aga inst the qallas Cowboys in 
Canton, Ohio, then allow me to 
tell the NCAA exactly how I feel. 

First, let me describe the situ-
ation leading up to the CCM 
playoffs and how it led to what will 
oon be known a.~ "The Snub." The 

Tritons went 23-17 in the CCM 
and 33 -19 overall in the regular 
season. They placed second in the 

Pomona and third overall behind 
the Broncos and the Wddcats, the 
North Division champions and 
preseason favorites. Chico State, 
which went 24-11 in the CCM 
and 40-12 overall, split its 8e8SOI1 
series with the Tritons, with each 
squad taking two games apiece. 

Once in the tournament, both 
teams did well enough to square 
off against each other in the CCAA 
Championship. The Tritons, on 
the brink of elimination, needed 
two wins over the Wildcats to 
steal the tide away from Chico 
State, which only needed one win 
to send the Tritons packing. 

With the odds in favor of Chico 
State, the Tritons played 23 .innings 
and won two games by a total of 
two runs to upset the Wildcats. 

After the celebration died 
down, the Tritons awaited the 
NCAAS announcement of their 
selection. However, it never came. 

Instead, the Tritons got passed 
over while the team they just 
beat twice in a row got honored 
with a No.2 seeding in the West 
Region of the tournament. How 
did the NCAA arrive at this deci-
sion? Did they simply ignore tl1e 
playoffs, the most important test 
of a team's performance under 
pressure? 

One possibility is that Chico 
State had a tougher schedule dur-
ing the season, making its record 
more impressive. However, even 
if the Wildcats had a chance to 
prove themselves against tougher 
competition, they still went 2-
4 against the Tritons, including 
the playoffs. The head-to-head 
record should count for some-
thing and the NCAA should be 
smart enough to realize that .• ' 

There is no logical explana-
tion for the NCAA's decision, 
which has left the Triton baseball 
team and their fans to wonder: 
what if? Meanwhile, the Wildcats 
have gone 3-0 in the tourna-
ment to become the West Region 
Champions and are on their way 
to face Delta State in the next 
round on May 28. If the 1:ritons 
could beat the Wildcats twice, 
who's to say that they wouldn't be 
on their way to their first NCAA 
Division II Championship?

After helping UCSD baseball 

to ifs best season since being 
in Division lI, seniors Logan 
Boutilier and Alex Gascon, junior 
Matt Lawson and sophomore 
David Morehead were selected 
to the NCAA All-West Region 
team on May 23 . Boutilier was 
named to the First Team, while 
Gascon, Lawson and Morehead 
were named to the Second 
Team. In addition, Boutilier 

and Morehead were 
named to the

Boutilier ended 
the season with an

for most wins in a season. He 
had an ERA of 3.47, striking out 
62 batters and walking 22 in 109

Gascon was one of the team's

R emember when Vince Carter hit that game-win-ner to send the Raptors 
to the finals? Remember when 
the Blazers crushed the Lakers 
in the seventh game and went on 
to bring the first championship 
to Portland since the days of Bill 
Walton? Remember when ... none 
of that happened? Carter missed 
his attempt at the buzzer during 
game seven of the 2001 Eastern 
Conference Finals, as Allen 
Iverson's 76ers ' advanced. The 

Blazers couldn't hold off a furious 
Lakers comeback the year before 
that, so instead of the beginning 
of a Trailblazer dynasty, we got 
the first of three Laker titles. Since 
then, the Raptors, now Carter-
less, have gone through coaches 
quicker than Wilmer Valderrama 
goes through hot women, and the 
Trailblazers have resembled Vinnie 
Barbarino and the Sweathogs -
without the ability to be controlled 
by the Kotter-esque Mo Cheeks. 

This year, two of the remaining 
four teams will advance to the NBA 
Finals and the other two teams will 
simply be afterthoughts. So, which 
teams are going to rise to the occa-
sion and which should start put-
ting together crazy promotional 
gimmicks to fill the seats? Well, if 
you really want to know ... 

WFSfERN CONFERENCE 
FINALS 

PHOENIX SUNS VS. SAN 
ANTONIO SPURS 

They might not be the defend-
ing champs, or even the defending 
Western Conference Champions, 
but with the reality show that 
took place in LakerLand, head 
coach Gregg Popovich and his 
International All-Stars are the 
closest thing the West has to a 
championship pedigree. The 
Suns are the number-one seed. 
They're fast, exciting and, with 
the return of forward/guard Joe 
Johnson, have at least six players 
who could explode for big games. 
Point guard Steve Nash has been 
better in the playoffs than he was 
during the regular season, and he 

was the MVP of the regular sea-
son. He has been increasing career 
highs during the entire postseason, 
and has helped those around him 
do the same. This looks like an 
offense vs. defense battle on paper, 
but the San Antonio Spurs, while 
superior in the half-court to every 
other team in the league, have the 
ability to keep up with the Suns 
and might even be able to out-run 
a run-down squad. The Spurs will 
turn on the defensive intensity 
when it's needed, but there's no 
way to really force the Suns to set. 
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em ... 
and then beat 'em too.

Athletes 
deserve 

scholarships 
Students' efforts, 

comrmtment 
justify funding 

Granted ... 
Matthew Grant 

Consider the image of VC D studen t athletes . They are indi Vidua ls who 
,ommit th~mselves to hours of 
intense practice c\'cry day for 
month ' at .1 time while excellll1g 
academically to boast one of the 
highe t Pr\.s of any stude nt group 
on campus. The success of these 
students wnhm their re 'pectl\'e 
sPOrtS and in the ,cholastic arena 
IS rarelv acknowledged Without 
also me~t1onmg the c'Omplete lack 
of athletic scholarships afforded 
to them. 

In th e past, reluctance to step 
away from the Image of a strictl y 
Jcademic institution where finan-
cia l support i not provided on 
the asis of athletic talent has 
been appl auded; however, VCSD 
i now actively rejecting I C 
Divi Ion II regul ati ons in favor of 
retaining the school 's firm prin-
ciple and traditions. 

urrent NCAA Divis ion II 
regulations stipulate that member 
in titution must provide a mini-
mum of $250,000 annually to stu-
dent athletes as scholarship fund. 
VCSD has received a waiver for 
the rule through the fall of 2006, 
making it the only one of 285 
schools not abiding by the policy. 

VCSD's incompliance and 
reluctance to adjust to the demands 
of a growing tudent body do not 
reflect the academically minded 
principles that in pired a no-ath -
leti c-scholarship poli cy. If this 
core is more proficient than the 
genera l student body academi -
cally, then would it not be in the 
better interest of the institution to 
promote it? 

So, when Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson 
unveiled a plan to offer democrati-
cally distributed scholarship funds 
to each of the nearly 550 student 
athletes at UCSD, whereby NCM 
requirements would be met with-
out abandoning the emphasis on 
academics, it was readily endorsed 
by A.S. leaders and VCSD athlet-
ICS . 

But rather than go before the 
Academic Senate on May 24, the 
proposal has been put on the back 
burner until the fall in light of crit-
icisms raised by faculty concerning 
the prioritization of money going 
to student athletes before reaching 
other programs. 

Am I missing something here? 
The choice of whether to com-
ply is swiftly disappearing, as the 
NCM will not grant exemptions 
forever, but that's beside the point. 
Student athletes are among the 
most universally talented people at 
UCSD, and we owe it to them to 
recognize their efforts. 

Accepting Watson's proposal 
would mean giving each student 
athlete $500 per year, as long as 
he or she remains eligible. Does 
this sound like a substantial sum 
relative to what is being sacrificed
