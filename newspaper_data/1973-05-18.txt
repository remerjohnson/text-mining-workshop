symbolic significance of formally announcing a Third 
College academic commitment to programs in 
economics, management sciences, and related dis-
cipli nes. 

" Third College is dedicating a substantial part of its 
academic emphasis to economics and related dis-
ciplines since it appears that these areas will be a 
pr.inciple factor in determining the rate at which 
O'linorities achieve full citizenship and participation in 

~merican society during the last quarter of the Twen-
tieth Century," Watson said. 

" It is our objective to both Increase the number of 
minority persons pursuing careers in economic and 
bu iness and to enlist the Intellectual resources of these 
r. a on the cause of improving the general welfare of 

minorities and society at large. .

Don Luee to Speak 
Hannah Cohen 

On Friday, May 18, at 
7:30 p.m. Don Luce, author 
of "Hostages of War , 
Saigon's Political 
Prisoners," will speak in 
Revelle Cafeteria. 

The Amer ican Friends 
Service Committee, a 
Quaker humanitarian relief 
group, is sponsoring his 
nationwide tour. All funds 
coll'ected th ro ugh this 
speaking engagement will 
go the the AFSC 
North/South Fund to aid 
civi lians in both North and 
South Vietnam. 

Don Luce believes that 
" Vietnam peace is impossi-
bl e without release of 
neutralist Saigon Pol itical 
Prisoners." His speech will 
be based upon his concern 
for political Prisoners in 
Vietnam (Saigon jails), his 
hopes for peace if they are 
released, and a desire to 
raise funds to help civi lians 
suffering in Vietnam. 

Don Luce, a 36 year-old 
agriculture economist, has 
spent most of t he last 

twelve years of his life in 
South Vietnam. He made 
world headlines two years 
ago when he, along with 
two American 
Congressmen, discovered 
the notorious " tiger cages" 
in one of South Vietnam's 
largest prisons. Because of 
this and su b sequent 
publication of his findings 
his visa was withdrawn by 
the South Vietnamese 
government in May 1971, 
for "special reasons." . 

After returning to the 
United States, Luce 
testified before the Senate 
Foreign Relation s Com-
mittee in Wa hington. He 
has also written widely on 
Vietnam in various national 
publications and is the co-
author of a book, Viet Nam : 
The Unheard Voice . 

Besides speaking and 
fund raising Luce is also 
leading a mobile exhibit on 
Indochinese' art, 
photographs and artifa~ts 
that is touring a number of 
cities in America.

Organizing to Keep Te Building Funds 
le Burke 

Monday night at the Third College Cafeteria, a 
campus-wide meeting was held to discuss the Senate 
action with regards to funds for the building of Third 
College. 

At the meeting, Provost Joseph Watson spoke, filling 
in the ~tudents on the background and ~easonil1g 
behind the Senate decision. He also mentioned the 
administrations' role in the effort to regain the funds. 

The consensus of the meeting was that the most 
effective means for students to voice support of Third 
College was through a mass letter writing campaign. 

The meeting broke up with an invitation by Sidney 
Glass, Third College Resident Dean, for interested 
students to meet at his home, and there begin the 
writing of letters to go to Sacramento. 

Of the 60-80 people in the cafeteria meeting, seven 
or eight showed up at Sidney's, and the result of their 
meeting was the form letters now being distributed on 
campus. 

For the next two weeks these letters will be on 
campus (they will be passed out at various places and 
available at all the dean's offices.) 

It is hoped Sacramento is as inundated by letters and 
telegrams as UCSD will be by these form letters, that 
the funds for Third College will be rescued. 

Students interested can pick up form letters, fill in 
the addresses and sign them. There are orange boxes 
all over campus where they may be deposited, and the 
mailing will be taken care of by students and the lobby 
annex. 

It is also suggested that students contact their parents 
and encourage them to add their voices to the support 
of Third College. 

The people to whom it is most important to send 
letters are: 
Senator James Mills (SO) 
Senator Randolph A. Collier 
Senator Robert Lagomarsino 
Verne Orr- Dept. of Finance,Assembly peaker Robert 
Moretti, Assemblyman Willie Brown, Assemblyman 
Frank Lanterman . 

If students wish to write their own letters rather than 
u e the form letters, here are a few guidelines on what 
to include. 

1) That Third College is not new, that it i an already 
existing (for three years) college. 

2) That support of Third College doe not impl 
upport of Fourth College, or gen rally, of further 

expansion anywhere in the system. 
3) That Th ird ha lived for thr e years," barrack and 

quan ot huts, crowded building particularl un uited 
to classroom use. 

4) That the concept of Third i uniquE. That it fill a

5) That to pre erve balance in the t m, th ocial

Karen Armitage 

The Office of Minority Recruitment for the Schoel of 
Medicine at UCSD is sponsoring a . Health Caree.rs 
Conference for minority pre-health s~lenc~ stud~nts In 
Southern California on May 26. In a~ interview with the 
TRITON TIMES, Mr. Andres Rodnguez, Student Ac-
tivities Coordinator, discussed the purpose and format 
of the conference: . 

According to Mr. Rodriguez, representatives or 
students from several schools involved in health care 
careers will be present at the conference. Among the 
schools participating will be UCSD,. UCSF, UCD, and 
UCLA. Several fields in health care will b~ represent.ed, 
including Optometry, Podia~ry, NurSing, Med!cal 
Technology, Hospital Administration, InhalatlO.n 
Therapy, Physical and Recreational The.rapy, and PubliC 
Health as well as Medicine and Dentistry. 

While the conference was organized for Sou!hern 
California minority pre-health stude~ts, Mr. Rodriguez 
indicated that the information available at the con-
ference would be useful to all pre-health stud.ents at 
UCSD and stressed the fact that the conference IS open 
to all interested UCSD pre-health students. 

The conference will last from 8:30 .a.m. to 4 p.m. 
During the morning hours there will .be a pa~el 
discussion on the various health profeSSions. DU~lng

mation available at the conference to the pre-health

etc., will be available . Minority health sCience s~udents 
and recruiters will also be available for diSCUSSion and

Sacramento News 
ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BOB MOREn:I .has a~nounced 

a three-prong investigati?n into the rISing price of fuel 
and gasoline in California. 

"So far the 'fuel shortage' has been used as an ex~use 
for higher priced gasoline, which is expected to climb 
even higher this summer; as a reason for renewed off-
shore drilling; as a reason to speed the develop~ent ~f 
the Alaskan pipeline and as an excuse to raise 011 
import quotas," Moretti said . 

"It is a matter of growing concern to myself, o~her 
members of the Assembly and, I'm sure, the public at 
large as to whether the fuel crisis is a reality ." 

The Speaker said three Assembly Committees will be 
conducting hearings in the next few mont~s. T~e 
Assembly Subcommittee on State Energy Policy will 
research the broad subject of the so-called "energy 
crisis" and the conservation of power. 

The Assembly Transportation Committ~e will be 
holding a series of hearings on fuel c.apaclty, supply, 
and delivery. Also, the Joint Commltte~ on . PUb.1ie 
Domain will focus on the price of oil in Cahf~rnla, wlt.h 
particular emphasis on prot.ecting the motonng public 
from capricious fuel pnce Increase. 

" WE MUST REMEMBER who is really affected by the 
freeze," said Assemblyman Peter R. Chacon (D-~an 
Diego), speaking of the impact of !he federal hOUSing 
moratorium on Southern California . 

"Among those hardest hit are our senio: citize.ns. 
After serving their country so well dUring their w~rkl~~ 
years, many are now being denied decent hOUSing. 

Assemblyman Chacon is chairman of the Assem?ly 
Committee on Urban Development and HOUSing 
which has been holding a series of heari ngs ~hrou,~h.out 
the state to assess the impact of the moratorium . Time 
and time again, our committee has heard reports of 
malnutrition developing in seniors who because of 
their high housing costs, cannot provide an adeq.uate 
diet for themselves. We really cannot allow thiS to 
continue," Chacon said. 

Lobby Advocates 
Landlord Act 

Many of the problems students annually fac;e when 
renting an apartment or house in California would b.e 
eliminated if a bill presently before the Assembly IS 
adopted. 

Assembly Bill 1202, Authored by Assemblym~n 
Charles Warren (D-Los Angeles) combines the essential 
elements of a June 1972 court decision (Hinson vs . 
Delis) and the "Model Residential Landlord and Te.n~nt 
Act" drafted last August in Chicago. The court deCISion 
upheld the right of the tenant t~ refuse te;> pay rent for 
an apartment that was in shocking condition. . 

The bill would outlaw non-refundable cleaning 
deposits, which have traditionally been used by 
landlords to take advantage of students. It would also 
require landlords to inventory ap.artments 
with the tenant, at th~ time the tenant moves In .. In.the 
past, m~ny tenants have been ch~r~ed for fur~lshlngs 
which the owner claimed were missing, but which had 
never been in his apartment. . 

The bill would also make it easier for many renters to 
sublease their apartments, Allhe present time landlords 
have the power to refuse to sublease an apartment on 
any grounds. In some instances the landlord has flatly 
refused to allow the renter to sub-lease at all. AB1202 
would stop these practices" . .. . 

Perhaps the major beneht of thiS bll~ howev~r, IS 
that it extends coverage of renters to include dormltorx 
residents. For the first time this group of renters .IS 
being considered equal to all other renters and will 
receive protection from the law.

Saturday Film: 
The Sorrow and the Pfty 

For the first time in the Sin Diego area Max Ophul's 
"The Sorrow and the Pity," a documentary epic on the 
themes of collaboration and resistence will be shown at 
UCSD. The film will show one time only at 7:30 p .m. in 
2722 USB and admission will be 50(. Advance tickets are 
recommended. The Urey Hall box office is open from 
12 to 4 p .m. Today. 

Pauline Kael wrote of the film : "Tne Sorrow and the 
Pity" is both oral history and essay; people who lived 
through the German occupation tell us what they did 
during that catastrophic period, and we see and hear 
evidence that corroborates or corrects or sometime~ 
flatly contradicts tham. A good portion of the material 
is no more than informed, intelligent television inter-
viewing; what makes the film innovative is the im-
mediate annotation of what has just been said, and the 
steady accumulation of perspectives and information, 
As the perspectives ramify-when we see the people as 
they are now and, in old snapshots and newsreel 
footage, as they were then- we begin to get an sense 
of living in history: a fuller sense of what it was like to 
participate in the moral drama of an occupied nation 
than we have ever before had. When history literally 
becomes the story of people's lives, we can't help but 
feel the continuity of those lives and our own. There's 
nothing comparable to liThe Sorrow and the Pity."

Maybe It's just as well. The riots of the middle sixties had a negative 
effect on University of Cali(ornia campuses in the form of budget cuts 
and the taxpayer backlash. The changes that these movements 
sought were necessary but the methods were ill-conceived. One of 
the tools available to Revelle Students that affect necessary changes 
is the Revelle Committee on College Affairs. 
The strength of the committee is directly related to the strength of its 
members. A strong Revelle Committee can affect major change on 
this campus, but only If the committee is Innovative and secondlY,has 
the support of the Revelle community.

Government Receives Lfttters Against Program 

Affirmative Action In Jeopardy -
Lynn Heising, Undergraduate Representative Chancellor's Ad-
visory Committe On Affirmative Action 

Recently, The UCSD Affirmative Action 
Committee has received word that there is 
talk in the Department of Health, Education 
and Welfare of disbanding the Affirmative 
Action program in regards to hiring women 
and minorities. A letter from Joan Huber, 
University of Illinois' Department of 
Sociology, has asked that people who sup-
port the Affirmative Action program, and 
what it has done to progress the status of 
women and minority people in the labor 
force, should write to their congressperson, 
or to the Secretary of the Departmemt of 
Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to 
show their displeasure with the plan to 
disband the program. ' 

At this moment, women's groups are 
organizing to protest the move by the Nixon 
Administration to disband the program. Ap-
parently, the tactic being used is to write to 
all persons who would be affected in the 
making of this decision. This tactic was 
chosen because supposed ly the reason why 
the Administration might attempt to disband 
the program is because there has been 
written protest made by academic ad-
ministrators and other hostile cri tics on cer-
tain university faculties notably, CUNY, 
SUNY, and Columbia. loan Huber's letter 
says "floods of mail have been received from 
these sources, and little mail in support of 
Affirmative Action." She has suggested that 
letters also be sent to Leonard Carment, 
Special Assistant to the President. Letters 
should stress the seriousness of the action if 
Affirmative Action should be abandoned. 
When writing to your Congressmen, please 
request that the member of congress write to 
HEW about the problem. Keep writing again 
and again to see what has been done. 

At UCSD, the Affirmative Action program 
has been effective in so far as forcing the 
predominantly white, upper-middle class, 
male administration and faculty in hiring 
people who do not fit exactly into that 
classification. There have been many strides 
forward-witness the new hirings on the 
faculty ranks of women and minorities. 
Although, admittedly, not as high in fre-
quency as some would desire, the number of 
hirings in the last two years during the 
implementation of the Program have been 
substantially higher than in the past. This is 
certainly not due simply to chance. There 
can be no question that the disbandment of 
this program would lead to the removal of 
the pressure from the government which has 
forced the administration and , faculty to 
improve their fair hiring practices, and per-
mit degeneration into the methods that were 
used in the past to make selections. 

All students, especially women and non-
white students, should seriously consider 
sitting down and writing a few letters. It may 
mean your future career, if nothing else. 

The people to write are the following: 
Senators: Allan Cranston; John Tunney; 

Representitive: Lionel Van Deerliu 
Representalive, and candidate for Cililifornia 
Governor: Jerome Wiliidle 
Address: Senate OUice Building, 
Washington, D.C.20501 
Representative Office Building Washington, 
D.C. 20510 

Probably the best choice to write to would 
be jerome Waldie, as he is coming up for 
election as governor in California, and would 
be more responsive to pressure applied by 
students in California. However, all the 
above should not be forgotten. 

Help The 5 & Dime 
Lincoln Cushing 

Once again I will try to elicit community 
re sponse in favor of the 5 & Dime 
Coffeehouse. I say the word "community" 
with a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth, 
for I really don't know if such a thing as the 
U.C.S.D. community exists. The 5 & Dime has 
been struggling for the past year, trying to 
serve as a resource to the resident students 
am to the late night students. We have kept 
the operation non-profit, we have secured 
funding for a film series and entertainment, 
and we have sponsored many other activities 
such as student film showings and dances 

The sad part is that there has been almost 

no responses to our pleas for more involve-
ment on the organizational level. We who ' 
"run" the 5 & Dime realize that a few people 
cannot be as responsive to community needs 
as a lot of people, but all attempts we have 
made to draw in more interested individuals 
have resulted in frustration . 

Please, reinforce my faith in humanityl 
People are needed to run the projector on 
free movie nights, to take ca re of the 
recieving and mailing of films, to be respon-
sible for arranging entertainment, to pick up 
V.C . donuts, to do what you want. We really 
need a lot of strong, creative energy. Do itl

Humanities 
Requirements 
Editor: 

May I make a few ad-
ditions to Rick Drom's nice 
write-up in the May 15th Ti 
on the proposed changes in 
the Revelle College gradua-
tion requirements. 

On the Humanities 
reguirement. Inasmuch as 
the Fall Class Schedule is 
already out, students should 
register next week for 
Humanities sections as usual. 
Seven courses in Humanities 
and Fine Arts will still be 
required, and even if the 
proposal passes, it cannot be 
put into effect until Winter 
Quarter. This is because new 
courses need to be 
developed and approved to 
satisfy the various options, 
and these must clear the 
Senate's Committe on 
Courses. 

The proposa Is for the 
minor, the language, and the 

social science requirements 
change written legislation 
and must also pass the full 
Academic Senate, We hope 
to get any changes on the 
agenda of the Senate's first 
Fall meeting. 

Unfortunately we are un-
able to mail out the ballots 
to facu lty until the first of 
next week . But we do en-
courage all Reve lle students 
to communicate to members 
of our faculty their thoughts 
and feelings about these 
requirements, as well as 
about the natural science 
sequence which will be dis-
cussed at the faculty'S June 
meeting.

Salaries Cut 
Editor: 

I read with interest about 
how the libraries are having 
their federal funds cut. You 
can be sure that whenever 
funds are cut the last group 
to feel it are the ad-
ministrators. Visit the 510 
library to see what I mean. 
This Ii brary has a director, a 
reference librararian and a 
map room assistant, none of 
whom have enough work to 
keep them busy. They sit at 
their desks and read 
newspapers for a large part 
of each day. The only people 
who actually work are the 
low paid , mostly student 
workers who cata log, shelve 
and check out books, So if 

~ibrary funds must be cut, 
Instead of shortening lihrary 
hours which has been the 
usual practice, why not cut 
down on the considerable 
amount of money that is 
presently being wasted on 
high administrative salaries?

Struggle More Harpsichord 
Important Article 
Editor: 

Why are political slogans 
considered acts of van-
dalism when political cam-
paigns do exactly what 
they, Mr. Ecker and Mr. 
Robertson, accuse Senor 
Nestor Paz of, whether ac-
tually or implied? Why is 
there a great up rising for 
individual "rights", the 
true meaning of "law" , 
"confusing the issues" , 
vanda lism, "u ncluttered 
walls", "clean air" , school 
property and " real ife 
pollution"? Are these the 
concerns of the average 
university students? Who 
knows, it is very easy for 
students here to feel safe 
when they talk or write of 
such issues bu t what of the 
people who work in the 
fields? Must they continue 
to suffer so that university 
students can feel safe and 
eat what they (students) 
want, when ever they want, 
with out regard to the 
price? The TRITON 
TIMES prints one article 
about the Safeway strike 
and the UFW that states 
numbers and words as data 
but what about the 
people? Why are these 
people su pressed and 
students allowed unlimited 
freedom? I present no 
answers because I do not 
know them, yet abstract 
ideas have and can cover 
up the despair of those 
with hope. Freedom is the 
ability to make choices and 
this is what the 
Farmworkers struggle for 
in their daily existence. 

Cesar Mont s 

Erroneous 
Editor : 

Charles Hyde's harp-
sichord article (TI, Ma y 11) 
contains some grievous in-
accuracies and warra nts 
comment. 

The clavichord does not 
resemble the p iano and 
harpSichord (nor do all 
harp s ichords re semb le 
slender pi anos). It is an 
oblong box in wh ich the 
strings run diagonally from 
a pin block on one end to 
bitch pins at the back and 
opposite end; it fits nicely 
into the back of a 
Volkswagon if the seat is 
down. The tone is not 
produced by rubbing, as 
stated, but by striking. The 
tangent both strikes and 
frets the string, and unlike 
the harpsichord, the 
clavichord can sustain a 
tone. Although soft and 
unsuitable for ensemble, 
its tone is far more ex-
pressive than that of its 
familar " sewing machine" 
contemporary, incapable 
of any but the grossest 
dynamic variation afforded 
by crude stops . (Some' 
harpsichords were built 
with "Venetian swells" 
which could vary the 
dynamics a bit more, using 
the principle of Venetian 
blinds.) In addition to sub-
tle dynamic shadings, the 
clavichord, with its direct 
action, cap produce nearly 
every nuance of intonation 
including vibrato, while 
the harpSichord is limited 
to an invariable pluck .

Spikers High 
For Big Tourney 

The UCSD baseball team 
ended their season on a 
good note as ::ley won 
their last three games of 
the season last week. 

The Tritons beat 
crosstown rivals USD (No. 
(No. 1,2, or 3?1. 3-2, with 
Randy Mil ler picking up 
the win , last Tuesda y. 
UCSD picked up two more 
wins in a double-header 
against Bio la (Bible 
Institute of los Angeles, 
would you believe?) . In the 
first game, Pete Yocky ac-
cou nted .for the win, 2-1, to 
bring his season record to 
three wins and eight losses, 
while Miller won the last 
game on a two-hitter, 
which was a no-hitler until 
the ninth inning, 6-4. 

The p itch ing staff did 
quite well over the season; 
despite the fad that they 
ended up on the short end 
of a score more often than 
not , with M iller (4-9 )

UCSD sent a coed volleyball to UCLA Saturday that 
had one thought in mind - to have lots of fun . Well, 
they accomplished their objective and managed to win 
a few matcheS' along the way. 

Each year UCLA sponsors an Intercollegiate Coed 
Tournament in which each team consists of three guys 
and three girls. The only difference in rules is that a girl 
must be involved in each play. This year twenty teams 
from all over the state attended the tourney, which was 
held in Pauley Pavillion. 

With these figures , it is 
hard to see how the team 
finished the season with a 
d isappointing 10-20 win-
loss record, but things 
should be looking up next 
year for coaches lyle Olsen 
a nd larr y Will ens, as , 
barring injuries, transfers 
and " holdouts," all but 
Pittman, including the 
pitching staff, sho uld 
return next season. 

The Tritons showed their 
potential in the last few 
games of the season, as 
they p(ayed high level 
baseball against US D, Biola, 
USIU (crosstown rivals 
again?) and Azuza Pacific. 

UCSD has added another 
NAIA championship to 
their long list of the above-
mentioned. Golfer Michael 
Wydra slashed his way to 
the individual cham-
pionship at the NAIA 
District 3 (Southe rn 
California) Sectionals. 

Wydra took the in-
dividual title with scores of 
74-75 for a 149 total in the 
one day 36-hole tourna-
ment held at Suboba Hot 
Springs, last weekend, on 
the par 72 course. 

In the 12-school tourna-
ment, with six players from 
each team, US IU took the 
team championship, and 
will represent the district at 
the Nationals in Spartan-
burg, South Carolina, 
followed by Redlands and 

CHARTER FLIGHTS 

UCSD, a respectable third . 
Wydr a's win has earned 

h i m a berth to the 
Nationals IF he can get 
$400-500 for expenses from 
the Intercollegiate Depart-
ment. 

The tournament went 
down to the (ast few holes 
as Wydra bogeyed the last 
two holes but held on to 
beat second-place Ricky 
Tenesa of USIU (75-75-150) 
and third-place Bill Pherr 
(73-76-151) of Clairemont, 
who played head-to-head 
with Wydra up to the last 
hole. 

Wydra remarked that the 
Subobe Club was a very 
good course and that the 
36 holes in one day were 
quite a strain and probably 
was the rea son for the 
scores. Wydra dedicated 
his victory to golf coach, 
Pat Pat ri cks. 

So bright and early Saturday morning, our intrepid 
adventurers left the friendly confines of Del Mar for 
UCLA. The team consisted of Carol Martindale, Karen 
Pacior, and Sue Papanek representing the feminine 
contingent, and Bruce Cazden, Tom Evans, and Tom 
Smith representing the mostly male half. They arrived 
in time to play their first patsy of the day, use. The 
team disposed of the Trojans easily, walking away with 
both games. The tritons had to wait until 1 p.m. for 
their next match, when the good guys got dinked to 
death by the infamous Glendale squad. Psyche-out, 
UCSD's record dropped down to 2-2. 

Immediately after that, the San Diego contingent 
faced the best team in the pool, the team that was to 
meet UCLA in the finals, long Beach City College. They 
split two games, UCSD being the only team in their 
division to defeat long Beach. 

This set the secne for the match with CSU 
Northridge, to determine who would accompany long 
Beach to the quarter finals . The good guys (oops, we 
must refrain from such chauvinist references) the good 
people dropped the first game, but still had a chance to 
advance on the basis of points. The team was thinking 
high, so high in fact that one of the players fell on the 
floor and went into hysteriCS when she hit a serve into 
the net. 

It was at this time that misfortune befell the Tritons, 
when a knockout blow was delivered. Carol Martindale 
pushed up a set and waited for Tom Smith to hit it. But 
it was Bruce Cazden who went up and made contact, 
but not with the ball. He accidentally struck Carol in 
the mouth, knocking her and the team out of conten-
tion. The team had to forfeit and Northridge went on to 
the quarter-finals, while Carol went to the emergency 
center to have stitches put in her li p. 

ONLY $8500 o ~"t.~ 
According to popular opinion, a good time was had 

by all despite the accident and a few losses. Carol 's lip is 
reported to be rapidly healing, so that once again she 
may join the ranks of the living. Also, anonymous 
sources say that Bruce Cazden's hand has almost fully 
recovered . The only thing that remains is for Tom Smith 
to recover from an acute case of emharrassment after 
being molested by one of the girls. At least he is no 
longer blushing, but what psychological traumas he 
may have suffered have yet to be ascertained .

Harpsichords were not 
the preferred instruments 
of the 2 leading keyboard 
performers . The virtue of 
the instruments was its 
volume and its finger-
strengthening qualities, ac-
cording to C.P.E. Bach, one 
of the leading performers 
of the time. His father 
probably favored the 
organ. Haydn wrote for the 
piano from its inceptiorr, 
and Mozart obviously 
much preferred the piano 
as his profuse wri ting for 
the new instrument attests. 
Beethoven is said to have 
owned and played a 
clavichord with great 
pleasure and, as is well 
known, wrote for the piano 
and not harpsichord. 

Yours etc., 
T.R. Gordon 

I quote from Nobody 
Wanted War by Ralph 
White, (Doubleday & Co., 
Inc., 1968) 
"While it is estimated that 
nearly 900,000 left the 
North , a mu c h smaller 
number , estimated 
va riou sly betwee n the 
figures of 60,000 and 150,-
000 moved North when 
Diem took over in the 
South."

Charles suggest that lithe 
age of great virtuosos 
passed " and thus the 
piano, a " domestic in-
st rument/' came into 
usage. Clearly, if there ever 
was an age of great vir-
tuosos, it was in the 
nineteenth century, and 
the instrument was the 
piano (albeit, a somewhat 
different instru ment from 
the early piano, which was 
an oblong box.) However, 
virtuosity is not confined to 
any period in history . 

It is not clear what is 
meant by the " problems of 
intonation" which are sup-
posedly so great on the 
harpsichord, as compared 
to the piano. The problems 
of intonation on the harp-
sicho rd are 01 the same ilk 
as the problems of a walrus 
who tries to run the high 
hurdles : it ca nnot trans-
cend its mechanical nature . 

Th is is not to say that 
they do not have their 
place. There is beautiful 
music which is best 
realized on the solo harp-

Olsen Fails 
To Refute 
Phung 
Edito r: 

I feel it necessary to call 
attention to Mr. Olsen 's 
letter last week condem-
ning Mr. Le cong Phung's 
article on "Were American 
Pilots Tortures?" 

Mr . Ol se n starts out 
responding to "one un-
identified Le cong Phung" 
and wishes he would 
"come out and announce 
your position in your coun-
try's Min ist ry of Truth ." 
Mr. Olsen goes on to call 
the article a " live piece of 
official North Vietnamese 
propoganda." Mr. l e cong 
Phung is also "someone 
who's' dedica tion is not to 
journalistic integrity ... " 

Mr. Olsen is good at ac-
cusations but he fails com-
pletely to refu te any fa cts 
about the Am e r ica n 
Prison rs existance as 
stated by Mr . le cong 
Phung. He will not direct ly 
cha ll enge Mr. l e co ng 
Phung's statements. Why? 

Alwa ys, Always . Mr.

ilrH GORDON BlJ)

Mr. White later states; 
" ... we must consider why 
so few went North ." /I •• • 
villagers are proverb ia lly 
difficult to uptoot." " ... the 
Geneva Agree ments gave 
the Viet Minh a prospect of 
election victo ry in 1956 if 
they stayed ... " "The small 
number moving North, 
therefore , cannot be 
regarded as a valid indica-
tion of the feeling of the 
peasants in generaL" 

The Vietnam conclict is a 
very complicated one with 
a long history. Are Vietnam 
and the United States now 
done with each other after 
all those yea rs of destruc-
tion? The issue must be 
studied carefully and fac-
tually, but not with bias 
and emotions.
