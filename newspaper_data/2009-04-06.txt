Garret Berg is pretty sure A.S. 
Programming just redeemed itself. 
Less than a year after students 
slammed his office for orchestrating 
what many referred to as the death 
of the Sun God Festival, Berg — 
current associate vice president of 
programming — has secured a slew 
of musicians he said he feels certain 
will inject new life into the annual 
festival.

Taking the main stage will be 
alternative hip-hop troupe N.E.R.D., 
followed by bearded folk-rocker 
Iron and Wine. Engineer turned 
sweaty dancehall hipster Girl Talk 
will headline the festival’s dance 
tent, a massive deejay-oriented 
enclosure to be located in the north-
east corner of RIMAC Field. 

The three top acts will be accom-
panied by Motion City Soundtrack, 
Sara Bareilles, Augustana, the Cool 
Kids, Grand Old Party, Rootbeer, DJ 
Nu-Mark of Jurassic 5, Anavan and 
Nosaj Thing. Also working the stage 
will be Battle of the Bands winner, 
the Theory of Funkativity. 

Cirque Berzerk — a contempo-
rary dance  group that re-imagines 
traditional circus performances by 
incorporating elements of punk 

rock, risque burlesque and horror-
flick fantasy — will return this year 
for a full day of performances. Los 
Angeles-based comedians in the 
Upright Citizens Brigade are sched-
uled to perform throughout the day. 
Both attractions will be located on 
the midway, a canopied stage to 
be located in the center of RIMAC 
Field. 

“We couldn’t be happier with the 
lineup right now,” Berg said. “We 
have diversity, we have big name 
acts — we think we really have 
something for everyone. It should 
be pretty phenomenal.”

Working with a total festival 
budget of approximately $550,000, 
Berg’s office sought to secure  big-
name artists by booking fewer sec-

ondary acts, pumping nearly one-
third of the Sun God budget — a 
move inspired by student criticism 
of last year’s lineup.

“What we heard from last year 
was ‘Enough of the small bands, we 
want that money spent on bigger 
acts,’” Berg said. “We really listened 
to that feedback and got rid of some 
of those smaller acts and tried to re-
orient stuff to the bigger acts.”

He said a great deal of atten-
tion went into securing acts that 
would appeal to a wider range of 
students than rapper Sean Kingston 
and rockers Coheed and Cambria, 
who performed last year.

“If you put this side by side with 

Revised festival will 
facilitate re-entry to 
RIMAC with streamlined 
wristband distribution.

This week, as students cast 
their TritonLink ballots for next 
year’s A.S. Council, they will be 
using the Single Transferable 
Vote system, which allows vot-
ers  to rank A.S. executive and 
academic-division senator can-
didates in order of preference. 

Although STV was imple-
mented in 2007, this is the 
first A.S. election it will impact 
because last year’s races were 
largely unopposed — and there 
are still a few kinks in the sys-
tem.

Under  STV, in the event that 
a student’s first-choice candi-
date receives the fewest votes, 
that vote will be transferred 
to the student’s second-choice 
candidate; and so on, until any 
one candidate achieves simple 
majority with 50 percent plus 
one vote. 

According to Associate Vice 
President of Athletic Relations 
Peter Benesch, the council 
switched to the STV system to 
encourage greater involvement 
in elections. Councilmembers 
felt students would be more 

inclined to vote for independent 
candidates if their votes would 
be transferred in the event of a 
loss, and that independent can-
didates would be more inclined 
to run for office if they felt stu-
dents wouldn’t be deterred from 
supporting them.

At UCSD, STV voting will 
only be used to determine races 
in which candidates compete 
for one position. All races other 
than those for the four execu-
tive offices and academic-divi-
sion senate seats will continue 
to be decided by the standard 
plurality system. Because candi-
dates in those races will be com-
peting for multiple spots — for 
instance, eight slots in the case 
of campuswide senator — the 
vote transfer becomes less clear. 

“It’s easier to abuse the 
system in these larger races,” 
Benesch said. He cited cases 
of strategic lobbying at UC 
Berkeley, where candidates 
on larger slates campaign for 
specific rankings in order to 
manipulate a more favorable 
transfer of votes.

The budget crisis spread to Price 
Center last Tuesday, when UCSD 
Bookstore and Perks Coffee Shop 
unveiled new business hours. Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs 
Steven Relyea attributed the changes 
to the nation’s current economic 
downturn. 

Previously, the bookstore’s hours 
were 8 a.m. to  8 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 6 
p.m. Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on 
Saturday and noon to 6  p.m. on 
Sunday. 

The hours have been changed to 8 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday 
and noon to 5 p.m. on weekends.

The coffee shop’s hours used to 
be 7 a.m. to  9 p.m. Monday through 
Friday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday 
and noon to 7 p.m. on Sunday. The 
hours have been changed to 8 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, 
and noon to 5 p.m on Saturday and 
Sunday.

Additionally, prices of products 
that have not sold well — main-
ly electronics and apparel — have 
continued to drop since a gener-
al downtrend in purchases began 
in November, UCSD Bookstore 

Director John Turk said. 
The bookstore has managed to 

break even by decreasing expen-
ditures at about the same 3.5 per-
cent rate at which sales have waned 
since November, and has avoided 
filling 12 career employee vacan-
cies — along with 15 student posi-
tion vacancies — in an attempt to 
cut costs. 

Though no employees have been 
laid off due to the cutback in hours,  
three cashiers have been moved to the 
bookstore-owned Sunshine Market, 
which has maintained normal hours.

Students participating in independent candidate Utsav Gupta’s presidential campaign prepare 
posters bearing the candidate’s slogans in Price Center Plaza on April 5. 

By Connie Shieh
Senior Staff Writer

Election week is finally here, 
and candidates are crossing their 
fingers after a month of fierce 
campaigning that included visits 
to student organizations, appeals 
to college councils and weeks of 
mingling with potential constitu-
ents in an effort to secure the 
student vote.

Perhaps the most anxious of 
these candidates are the three pres-
idential hopefuls: Erin Brodwin of 
Student Voice!, Adam Teitelbaum 
of the Clean Slate and independent 

candidate Utsav Gupta.
Addressing issues of college 

affordability, campus life and 
student involvement in coun-
cil affairs, Brodwin, Gupta and 
Teitelbaum sought to paint a pic-
ture of a more perfect student-
governing body.

Students can vote on 
TritonLink all this week. Polls 
close Friday,  April 10 at 4 p.m.

A news article published on March 12 titled “Five Candidates Vie for A.S. 
Presidency ” incorrectly stated that in order for the results of the 2009 A.S. elec-
tion to be valid, at least 20 percent of the student body must vote. In fact, this 
applies only to referenda. Candidate elections require a one-vote threshold.

manager Frank Carroll, because 
withdrawn candidates couldn’t be 
removed from the ballot due to 
programming issues on TritonLink, 
they could impact the election 
results in STV races. Votes for with-
drawn candidates are disregarded 
in plurality races, but because of 
STV’s ranking system, they could 
potentially affect final numbers.

“We don’t really know the impli-
cations,” Carroll said. “[Withdrawn 
candidates] could take votes away 
from a third-place candidate … It 
could screw up who [would] actu-
ally win.”

However, in the event that a 
withdrawn candidate garners 
enough votes to knock another 
candidate out of the race — thus 
influencing the transfer of votes and 
election results — Carroll said the 
elections committee could deter-
mine the proper STV winner by 
hand. 

“There’s no doomsday scenario 
except that it would be a pain in the 
butt,” he said. 

Carroll also hopes to adjust the 
election code so it remains consis-
tent with university policy in the 
future. Currently, “dorm storming” 
— going door-to-door through the 
resident halls to solicit students — 
is forbidden by university policy, 
but is left out of the election code. 
Because of this discrepancy, griev-
ances regarding dorm storming are 
technically illegitimate. However, 
Carroll made a special ruling on 
March 31 that forbade the prac-
tice, and will entertain grievances 
should any violations occur.

JOHN HANACEK/GUARDIAN
Local rock group the Theory of Funkativity won Battle of the Bands at the Loft on April 4, securing a spot in the lineup of this year’s Sun God Festival.

The bookstore has significantly 
dropped prices for electronics and 
apparel and temporarily decreased 
inventory by lowering the amount 
of products and increasing the fre-
quency of purchases. This allows 
the bookstore to buy at discount 
from its vendors while better meet-
ing the rate of student demand. 

“The breadth is the same but the 
depth is less,” Turk said.

The ripple effects of a failing 
economy have caused a general 
decline in depart-
ment spending at 
the bookstore, a 
major source for 
faculty electron-
ics, Turk said. 

While Turk 
said he noticed an 
increase in school 
spirit over the last 
few years, students 
are buying fewer 
logoed products 
— such as hooded sweatshirts — 
indicating not a loss in interest, but 
less financial freedom to act upon it.

“We want to make sure to do 
everything we can to provide a 
lower price during difficult eco-
nomic times, but we need to know if 
the customers coming to the book-
store have stopped buying and still 
browse or have stopped coming,” 
Turk said. “They’re still coming and 

they’re still shopping, but they’re 
not buying as much.”

Unlike the bookstore, Perks 
Coffee Shop and the Sunshine 
Market are currently receiving more 
business than before the reces-
sion forced students to cut back on 
spending. The coffee shop’s sched-
ule changes primarily reflect greater 
economy with the bookstore and 
learning to match peak demand 
hours for its clientele. 

Since the bookstore has a gen-
eral history of steady growth, Turk 

said he expects this 
setback to be tem-
porary. Despite a 
drop in freshman 
enrollment, Turk 
is hopeful that the 
construction of on-
campus housing will 
bolster sales at the 
bookstore. Because 
students in the 
dorms spend more 
per capita than 

those living off campus, Turk said he 
expects demand to rise. 

The reduced hours will continue 
through the summer. In July, Turk 
will consult with university officials 
about Fall Quarter hours — which, 
once decided, will go into effect by 
mid-September.

last year’s lineup, it’s a world of dif-
ference,” Berg said. “We feel that 
there’s truly something for everyone, 
and we’ve kind of thrown that phrase 
around in the past. But this year, 
from the beginning, we looked at 
every slot and said ‘What can we do 
with this? Who can we hit here?’”

The addition of the dance tent was 
inspired by the recent surge in popu-
larity of the Fall Quarter all-campus 
dance, a trend that Berg hoped to 
capitalize on by introducing a more 
dance-oriented aspect into the festi-
val’s attractions. Aside from perfor-
mances by Girl Talk, DJ Nu-Mark 
and a handful of other deejay acts, 
the tent will also feature daytime per-
formances by members of the Deejay 
and Vinylphiles Club. 

The festival will feature two sepa-
rate vendor fairs: student-run booths 

along the west end of RIMAC Field 
and a string of commercial vendors 
on Hopkins Drive. 

Berg is also in talks with the Loft 
to set up a film, music and art show-
case of “Loft experience,” though 
plans are still in the early stages.

The programming office also 
worked to dramatically overhaul the 
festival’s wristband distribution sys-
tem. This year, wristbands will be 
distributed on the day of the event at 
a designated check-in area consist-
ing of 24 different waiting lines near 
the festival’s Ridge Walk entrance, a 
change that Berg hopes will stream-
line the process. 

 “Students don’t have to worry 
about wristbands until the day of the 
festival,” Berg said. “We’re basically 
going to run it like an airport and 
try get people through as quickly as 
possible.”

Re-entry to RIMAC Field will be 
permitted at any time throughout he 
12-hour festival.

Berg said his department is work-
ing to create an additional series of Sun 
God-related activities in the week lead-
ing up to the main event, geared toward 
anticipation and expanding Sun God 
excitement beyond the confines of 
RIMAC Field. Though plans for these 
events have yet to be solidified, Berg 
said they would likely include noon-
time concerts in a centralized area such 
as Price Center Plaza.

“We want to have an atmosphere 
around campus that is different 
from your typical week,” Berg said. 
“Basically, transforming the campus 
… so that when you walk outside 
your dorm, you know it’s Sun God.”

The most important question on the A.S. ballot has no easy answer.
Though three eager candidates 

have given this year’s race to the A.S. 
presidency a much-needed jolt of 
competition — after current Student 
Voice! President Donna Bean ran 
unopposed last spring — the 2009-
10 hopefuls are nothing to shout 
about.

SV! puppet Erin Brodwin, the 
current associate vice president of 
local affairs, is the surest public 
speaker of the bunch. At the mid-
day presidential debate last week 
in Price Center, she succinctly 
laid down what appeared to be a 
well-conceived plan to stand firm 
against the administration on con-
cerns like protecting free speech, the 
Literature Building cancer cluster 
and the Sun God Festival’s welfare, 
meanwhile promising to iron out 
the council’s tendency to bicker. 

But off the podium, Brodwin is 
guarded — difficult to get a hold 
of and rattling off the same intan-
gible talking points in conversation. 
Despite her self-pledged devotion to 
fighting amplified sound zones in 

UCSD’s current speech policy, she 
and the other two student represen-
tatives appointed to the committee 
currently redrafting the policy have 
taken no steps to contact the admin-
istrators with ultimate control over 
each zone. She also doesn’t think 
A.S. enterprises like the Grove Caffe 
should surpass self-sustainability to 
bring in a profit, basically defying 
the entire purpose of an enterprise.

On the other hand, Adam 
Tietelbaum — former Alpha Epsilon 
Phi president and frontman to the 
peppy Clean Slate — is approach-
able, clear-headed and ridiculously 
nice. However, he’s unaware of the 
bureaucratic mess he’ll be taking on, 
instead focusing on all the fun-and-
games student-life ideas like an A.S. 
screen name and Facebook account 
that running mate Stephanie Usry 
already has a more ambitious grasp 
on — and could probably handle 
with her left pinky. 

Though he cites challenging the 
alcohol policy as an important step 
to revamp the Sun God Festival, 
he hasn’t demonstrated an essential 
understanding of how any of these 
policies could be challenged, nor 
outlined the ins and outs of the 
system — necessary steps in nego-
tiating with higher-ups. Tietelbaum 
lacks an effective president’s crucial 
familiarity with what it would take 
to bend university policy — some-
thing he claims could be remedied 
by holding a grown-up conversation 
with administrators. If that was a 
viable solution, Bear Gardens would 
be Beer Gardens and there’d be 50 at 
the Sun God Festival alone. 

That isn’t to say Utsav Gupta, 
running independently after fail-
ing to receive SV! support, won’t 

likewise be trampled by the mon-
ey-minded suits up top. He’s soft-
spoken and inoffensive — a general 
people-pleaser. 

But after three years of A.S. 
involvement, he can tell you exactly 
how to structure a task force that 
has some hopes of traversing the red 
tape. His initial intentions to run on 
the cursed SV! slate were allegedly 
in hopes of saving it from its “darker 
side,” restoring the bigger-picture 
principles of 2006-07 president 
Harry Khanna (whom Gupta essen-
tially worships) with the invalu-
able guiding light of institutional 
memory.

“We’ve become this kind of legis-
lative bureaucracy that passes poli-
cies that don’t affect anybody but 
ourselves,” he said.

While Brodwin’s only goal is to 
redecorate the ship (and Tietelbaum 
would spend two quarters just try-
ing to find the helm), Gupta is 
determined to turn it around and 
start again. He’s overflowing with all 
the right ideas — a weekly YouTube 
address, a Bear Garden at the Sun 
God Festival, a plan to rally packs 
of passionate students to pressure 
administrators — even though he’s 
probably way too busy (and nice) to 
see them all through.

But there’s something to be said 
for optimism. Sure, as current AVP 
of student organizations, he hard-
ly speaks at meetings and shows 
absolutely no history of facilitat-
ing the flow of communication he 
now advocates. And his dream for 
a UCSD football team is almost 
as farfetched as it is nauseatingly 
expensive. 

Thing is, in the land of the blind, 
the one-eyed man is king.

There’s no denying it: Stephanie Usry in an excep-tional leader. That much is 
clear from speaking with just about 
anyone running for office next 
year. “I feel like she could have run 
for president,” one Student Voice! 
campuswide senator candidate 
said. Whether they be SV!, Clean 
Slate or independent, the major-
ity of candidates mentioned Usry 
by name as someone they look 
forward to working with next year 
— and a good portion said she’s 
responsible for their own interest 
in student government.

Although Usry took a hiatus 
from council politics this year, she 
remains entrenched in UCSD stu-
dent life, maintaining a sophisti-
cated understanding of A.S. dynam-
ics. But rather than getting bogged 

down in the petty fuss that’s been so 
detrimental to the current council, 
Usry is energetic and forward think-
ing. Her approach to the office of 
student life lies in small, manageable 
changes that add up to make a big 
impact on students. And although 
she has ambitious goals for next 
year, she’s armed with a thoughtful 
and meticulous game plan.

Unlike her opponent, Usry’s 
passionate about committee work 
— often the place where real 
changes are made — recognizing 
the most effective way to facilitate 
campus improvement. She’s also 
practical about what doesn’t work, 
noting that A.S. resolutions, which 
have dominated council attention 
this year, are ultimately words 
without action and currently lack 
meaningful followup.

But perhaps most importantly, 
she understands the big picture. 
She’ll be able to protect student 
interests when working with 
administrators on projects like 
the Sun God Festival because she 
knows when and how to com-
promise effectively. Her extensive 
familiarity with the nuances of 
UCSD bureaucracy and her abil-
ity to see the forest through the 
trees make her a successful leader, 
capable of making a measurable 
impact for the better on student 
life next year. Now if only she’d run 
for president.

VICE PRESIDENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRSVICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCE AND RESOURCES

There is no one more quali-fied than Peter Benesch to be next year’s vice president 
of finance and resources. He has 
worked diligently on the A.S. finance 
committee this year alongside cur-
rent incumbent Naasir Lakhani to 
ensure a seamless transition period. 
But more importantly, he has infused 
the committee with an enthusiasm 
and thirst for efficiency — work-
ing to improve the state of council 
spending this year.

As the current associate vice pres-
ident of athletic relations, Benesch 
has often been a voice of reason, 
providing a much-needed histori-
cal perspective to the self-involved 
council. His personal interest and 
attention to detail spans well beyond 
his job description, and his extensive 
knowledge of the council’s recent 
history should be applauded.

Benesch knows the council’s 
dependency on student fees desper-
ately needs to change, and unlike 
other candidates he has concrete 

plans to start the process. In addition 
to finally giving A.S. enterprises — 
such as the failing Grove Caffe — the 
attention they deserve to start turn-
ing a profit, Benesch is interested in 
pursuing a new A.S. Store. Although 
other candidates have piggybacked 
this idea, Benesch is the only one 
who’s done the research to form a 
responsible, feasible plan to make 
that goal a reality. He also plans to 
lighten the council’s financial burden 

with tasteful sponsorships at council 
events like Bear Gardens.

Not only will Benesch make an 
excellent vice president, he will be 
exactly the kind of councilmember 
those Wednesday meetings need. 
He will bring a momentum for 
improvement to his position, finally 
weaning the council off its student-
fee addiction, and a refreshing 
atmosphere of competence to the 
council floor.

As the only candidate running for vice presi-dent of External Affairs, 
Gracelynne West has already won. 
But that doesn’t mean she has any 
idea what she’ll do once in office. 
Judging by her inability to form 
concrete plans or original ideas 
for how to approach her job, this 
campus is in for a year of ineffec-
tual outreach and meek legislative 
lobbying.

West has focused on increasing 
diversity at the university while 
ensuring that college affordability 
remains a legislative priority. Her 
plans for achieving these goals? 
It’s hard to tell because West 
appears to have difficulty express-
ing her ideas, often stumbling 
over her words in attempting to 
describe her stances on important 
issues. 

It’s difficult to imagine anyone 
so unassuming and inarticulate 
as West displaying the type of 
gung-ho spirit and hardnosed 

position-taking necessary to rep-
resent our university within any 
serious political arena.

When she does speak up, 
West offers unoriginal solutions 
to complex problems that have 
plagued our university for years. 
Asked how she intends to increase 
diversity at UCSD, West harps 
on strategies of “outreaching to 
students.” Questioned about her 
ability to lobby for the California 
D.R.E.A.M. Act and the California 
College Affordability Act, West 
points to her success in register-
ing students to vote in the 2008 
presidential election. How those 
things are related remains to be 
determined, but West assumes 
that every student she helped to 
register automatically became a 
D.R.E.A.M. Act supporter. 

Unless West has some Jedi-like 
powers of persuasion she has yet 
to reveal, not much is going to 
happen in the External Affairs 
office next year.

On a slate whose goals are constantly distracted by internal bickering, Katie Hall isn’t afraid to criticize this year’s self-interested council and stand up for 
the student body’s best interests. That’s why when council-
members refused to run a referendum that could have gath-
ered sorely needed funding for the Loft, Hall recognized its 
value to students — despite its ties to university administra-
tion — and dissented.“I think the students are smart enough 
to make their own decisions,” she said.

Hall’s pledge to focus on improving already-existing pro-
grams shows she recognizes the limitations of a 10-month 
term, but that doesn’t mean she lacks ambitious goals for 
next year. Besides hoping to keep the Loft afloat, Hall plans 
to bring programs she’s worked hard on as a Revelle College 
senator — like career-development seminars for humanities 
majors  — to the greater campus. And just to make sure she’s 
giving you what you want, she’ll be pushing for more online 
forums where students can voice their opinions.

Carli Thomas dreams of an A.S. Council that does more than just show up for meetings. But her emphasis on accountability and her ability to set 
and accomplish goals puts her ahead of the pack. Thomas 
wants to institutionalize communication within the A.S. 
Council’s framework, so councilmembers know what 
they need to do, when and why.

And her track record proves she can make it happen. 
In her current position as a Thurgood Marshall College 
senator, Thomas’ excellent attendance and meaningful 
contributions at A.S. Council meetings are more than 
gold stars — they demonstrate her commitment to both 
councils, facilitate communication and help keep both 
parties informed. 

Even her work on the upcoming “Know Your Rights” 
campaign — something she hopes to offer throughout 
all three quarters next year — shows she’s listening to 
students and working to meet their needs.

A pimped-out campus calendar and free Doritos on finals week are all fine and dandy, but the coun-cil needs at least one (competent) member who 
remembers there’s a world of hurt beyond the eucalyptus 
grove. Unlike many unfocused Student Voice! candidates 
pushing the same-old minority/diversity/culture aware-
ness package, Earl Warren College councilmember Bryant 
Pena has a cause — and a plan. He wants to unify campus 
philanthropy groups into “almost a UN panel” that would 
meet monthly, streamlining their efforts by redirecting to 
increase overall efficiency.

He also appreciates that your average 20-unit stress case 
will need more than a photocopied flyer to care. “Tupac 
taught Biggie this idea where you make a hit and it gets 
people to listen to the rest of your album,” Pena said. Cue 
the hip-hop awareness events, indie film screenings and 
strategically placed anti-admin flyers; Pena’s got you on 
lock.

Unlike the cliquish squabblers currently drawing A.S. meetings into the wee hours, Eleanor Roosevelt College councilmember Adam Kenworthy knows 
we’re all in this together. Along with bringing representatives 
from the Student Center co-ops into A.S. negotiations, he 
prioritizes patching things up with the student organizations 
alienated by past councils.

“If you’re not on an org on good terms with A.S., you’re 
kind of left out of the loop,” he said.

Kenworthy also has a grasp on what it takes to reach out 
to students — aka, more than enlarging the A.S. logo on event 
flyers. He wants to hold more frequent town-hall forums for 
students unwilling to sit through tedious council meetings, 
open a voicemail hotline to be updated weekly with campus 
event info and establish a committee dedicated to gauging 
effective ways of gathering student input. 

Even more important: He’s pretty much into doing what-
ever Stephanie Usry wants to do.

After nearly two years of involvement in both the A.S. Council and Student Council at Eleanor Roosevelt College, Alex Vu has an acute under-
standing of the intricacies of college politics and an ability 
to gauge his constituents’ needs. 

In speaking with Vu, it becomes clear that he has not 
taken his service to the student body lightly. He demon-
strates an ability to pinpoint issues of importance not only 
within the context of his own work but also within the larger 
scope of A.S. activity, suggesting well-informed strategies 
for how to better integrate college councils with the A.S. 
Council while offering concrete goals to improve campus 
spirit among students. 

Vu is new to the A.S. Finance Committee, but has already 
developed knowledge of the means necessary to efficiently 
allocate council funds. He promised to use his time as a sena-
tor to improve upon this allocation process, a promise that he 
appears likely to honor given his interest in the field. 

The A.S. ballot will allow students to vote for their top eight choices for campuswide sena-tor. However — after a run of disheartening 
interviews with candidates either unaware of their 
own platforms or unable to locate the Student Center 
altogether — we can only express confidence in the 
following five.

One or more of the nine unendorsed candidates 
expressed that: cancer awareness was his biggest 
concern, yet he was unaware of the cancer cluster at 
the Literature Building; Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 

makes a million dollars a year; free speech is something you can “do;” students would be 
down to listen to podcasts of eight-hour A.S. meetings while at the beach; UCSD spends 
$700 million each year on public transportation; it is the right of the A.S. Council to seize 
land from the university without reimbursement; trusting one’s gut and friends is the most 
reliable way to make decisions on council; Grove Caffe Manager Cleveland Thomas runs 
the entire Student Center; Student Affirmative Action Committee organizations are under-
represented on the council.

Has vision and knowledge to cut 
dependence on student fees.

Dear Editor,
I read with interest the April 2 

Guardian editorial concerning the 
effect of the world financial crisis on 
market-based appointments at the 
University of California. I appreci-
ate the student perspective, and I 
encourage all members of the UCSD 
community to look carefully at the

Dear Editor,
As the world continues to change 

at a fast pace, people in the United 
States should constantly adapt to 
the changes. The current economic 
downturn reveals the greed and cor-

ruption in the financial industry. 
Therefore, ethics should become the 
top issue of American education. 
Ethics is the main focus of both 
Chinese literature and philosophy. 
In fact, Chinese literature pursues 
peace, wisdom, virtue, beauty and 
prosperity that can be applied to 
daily life. The quality of a nation’s 
literature relies on how the govern-
ment treats its writers. The Chinese 
government had sponsored talented 
writers from 100 B.C. to 1910 A.D. 
It not only provided schools and 
libraries to educate them, but also 
offered them government positions. 
This unique way to reward writ-
ers in world history made Chinese 
writers create the best literature and 
philosophy in the world. China has 
also become the major debtor of the 
United States. 

The close relationship in this 
small world demands deep mutu-
al understanding. However, the 
American public’s knowledge of 
Chinese culture is limited to Bruce 
Lee’s movies and egg rolls. The 
courses in Chinese offered in the 
U.S. universities are limited to con-
versations such as greetings and 
asking directions. The media in 
the United States has sent Chinese-
Americans to China to gather mate-
rial. Due to its lack of background 
in Chinese culture, its research link-
ing the East to the West culminates 
in the discovery of the connection 
between fortune cookies and lottery 

numbers.
Frankly speaking, China’s 

strength does not lie in its weaponry, 
its space technology, the leadership 
of its politicians or its economic 
power from exports, but rather in 
the legacy of moral courage found in 
the works of Chinese poets, writers 
and philosophers. 

Raising the level of understand-
ing of Chinese culture requires access 
to good translations. However, there 
are too few resources and qualified 
people in this field to meet such 
an enormous demand. In order to 
eliminate distrust and misunder-
standings due to cultural differences, 
help fellow Americans adjust to the 
fast-changing world and preserve 
America’s leadership of the world 
community, it is important that the 
American media have a plan to sys-
tematically introduce Chinese cul-
ture to the American public.

A s an A.S. novice, Adam Teitelbaum anchors his presidential campaign not in starting policy and programming efforts from scratch — as his Clean Slate affiliation suggests — 
but in finding a middle ground between student wants and the 
administration’s demands. This rookie believes he has the bird’s 
eye view to find that paradise. 

“[I’m] going to be able to look at any issue or budget and say, 
‘You know what? From an outside perspective, that doesn’t make 
sense, and it doesn’t seem efficient,”’ Teitelbaum said. 

With a driving slate motto of “It’s what you make of it, and 
we’re here to help,” Teitelbaum proposes updating current pub-
licity methods such as Facebook with new features in order to 
ensure student involvement in council decisions and policy revi-
sions, as well as A.S. events. 

“We’re not going to put our Facebook profiles on private, 
and we’re going to use things like Twitter, AIM accounts and 
Facebook so students are writing the A.S. agenda, and A.S. 
doesn’t write the students’ agenda,” he said. 

As of press time, Teitelbaum’s Facebook profile was set to 

private. 
Teitelbaum said TritonLink could be 

an especially valuable tool, and suggested 
pop-up ads for campus news and events that 
would appear while students wait to access their 
information. 

From a functional standpoint, Teitelbaum’s rec-
ommendations are feasible, but administrators must 
“determine if [students] will be annoyed by constant ads,” 
Director of Electronic Communications Beth Surrell said. 

Current A.S. President Donna Bean said student input is 
achieved most effectively through council representatives who 
visit student organization meetings. 

“Adam is absolutely unqualified, [with] no expectations [and] 
no goals,” she said.

Teitelbaum has expressed his support of “free-speech zones,” 
which many believe to be unconstitutional. He proposed the

U tsav Gupta has been eyeing the A.S. presidency since before he set foot on this campus. As an incoming freshman in the summer of 2006, he called then-president and Student Voice! 
slate founder Harry Khanna to express his enthusiasm for student 
government. 

Before long, Gupta had become a Khanna protege, tagging 
along on lunch dates with student organizations and taking notes 
on his every move. 

The young politico went on to spend nearly three years with 
the Student Voice! slate. Now, after being denied his slate’s presi-
dential bid, Gupta is relying on his own merit — and institutional 
memory — to draw the independent vote.

Gupta’s main priorities include uncaging the Sun God Festival 
from RIMAC Field, freezing tuition and redefining the council as an 
inclusive body that represents all UCSD students.

Gupta will be the first to tell you that his platform is ambitious. 
His goals, he said, will be accomplished by galvanizing an increas-
ingly stagnant A.S. Council.

“Ambition, especially in a student government, is what we need at 

this point in time,” he said. “I don’t think 
it’s fair to the student body to always cam-
paign on short-term measures. We need to con-
tinue moving forward instead of moving sideways.”

In order to spread the Sun God Festival back across 
campus, Gupta said he intends to reintroduce elements that 
existed prior to 2008 — such as a daytime stage in Price Center 
and a line of student-organization booths on Library Walk. 

Current AVP of Programming Garrett Berg said this plan is 
unrealistic, considering the occupancy of these areas. Last year, over 
20,000 wristbands were sold for the event.

“The festival, as big as it was last year, could never exist in those 
venues,” he said.

Despite administrative concerns that spreading the festival  
back out would endanger students and raise security costs, 
Gupta is confident that by collaborating with college councils 
to promote college-specific events during the festival, crowds

E rin Brodwin is running on the Student Voice! slate — and she won’t let you forget it.
An Eleanor Roosevelt College junior with 

a year of experience as associate vice president 
of local affairs, Brodwin touts the pillars of the 

Student Voice! — student empowerment,  access 
and affordability and campus community — with 

the sureness of an experienced politician. 
Brodwin emphasized her ability to build rela-

tionships with administrators, legislators and diverse 
student organizations. She said she hopes to stay true 

to these pillars through relentless meetings with student 
organizations and college councils, and by encouraging 

student input through campaigns on Library Walk. 
As AVP of local affairs, one of Brodwin’s biggest projects 

was to help organize the external and local-affairs lobby corps, 
which lobbied lawmakers in Sacramento earlier this year. 

“At the student conference in Sacramento, we sent students 

and met representatives and discussed the need for decreas-
ing student fees,” Brodwin said. “We successfully made sure 
the proposed fee increase of 10 percent was significantly 
reduced [to 7.3 percent] and we hope to do something like 
that again.”

Brodwin said she hopes to institutionalize the student 
lobby corps and put continued pressure on lawmakers and the 
UC Board of Regents to keep student fees as low as possible. 
She plans to participate in the large student presence at the 
May regents meeting — which will take place at UCSD — to 
protest further student-fee increases.

“When student fees go up, it puts the burden of taxes on 
the backs of students, targeting underrepresented communi-
ties,” Brodwin said. “As far as I’m concerned, education is a 
right.”

Brodwin also said a satisfactory free-speech policy is one 
of her top concerns, and has worked as an undergraduate stu-

use of permits to ensure that protestors secure administrative 
approval (though he adamantly opposes discrimination in permit 
allocation based on content). 

“If [students] want to be at work in the library or classroom and 
don’t want to bothered, they shouldn’t be bothered,” Teitelbaum said.

In the case of an impromptu protest, he suggested establishing 
a hotline for protestors to contact the police department or the 
vice chancellor of student affairs’ office in order to obtain verbal 
approval. 

Teitelbaum’s vision of the Sun God Festival takes a similar middle 
-ground approach on student safety. He cites two reasons why the 
event will never return to its original format: the administration and 
police department. 

Though he initially expressed that returning to an “uncaged” 
Sun God Festival would be impossible, Teitelbaum now advocates 
returning the festival to an all-campus format by “advocating for 
the revision of the current alcohol policy.” He would like to see 
alcohol-related sponsorship for events like Bear Gardens, which 
would cut funding costs for the A.S. Council, cover outlay for 
heightened security and provide an incentive for of-age students 
to attend campus events. He hasn’t yet spoken with administrators 
about the policy.

A.S. Associate Vice President of Programming Garrett Berg said 
doubling back to Sun God’s all-campus format would diminish the 
festival’s longevity. 

“We want Sun God to be campus community and festival first, 
and if there’s alcohol there, it’s a smaller part of it,” Berg said. 

As president of Alpha Epsilon Pi last year, Teitelbaum banned 
drug use during chapter events by revising the fraternity constitu-
tion to include punishments for violators, such as suspension from 
the fraternity. Although the decision drew much opposition, current 
president Joey Lipton-Schwartz said enforcement has been offset by 
the fraternity’s inability to prevent drug use outside of brotherhood 
activities.

Teitelbaum also served as Eleanor Roosevelt College’s housing 
and dining committee representative for two years, where he dealt 
with policy revisions including a student fee increase from $1,800 
to $2,700. Teitelbaum blames the fee hikes on the escalating price 
of providing housing and dining services, and put the amount in 
perspective by comparing it to La Jolla’s high living costs.

Teitelbaum said his ability to adjust housing and dining policies 
under real-world hurdles will translate to the A.S. presidency in that 
he would need to incorporate shifting variables like the economic 
downturn into council decisions. And although he admits his blan-
ket ideas will not solve all campus issues, he believes he can put a 
fresh perspective to redirecting policies and programming toward 
students’ interests.

dent representative on the campus committee to revise 
the free speech policy.

Although Brodwin said it would be ideal to have no 
policy at all, she is working with administrators. 

“I consistently was honest and told [the A.S. coun-
cil] how I was feeling and that the students were being 
marginalized and the administration was being over-
represented,” Brodwin said.

Although the committee’s meetings are public record, 
Brodwin emphasized that having the minutes e-mailed 
out to committee members has been one of her most 
significant achievements on the committee. 

To increase student input at council meetings, 
Brodwin said she plans to reorganize the A.S. Forum in 
hopes this will make the environment less intimidating 
— so that the council and the public are parallel.

She also suggested moving A.S. council meetings, 
which are currently held on the fourth floor of Price 
Center East, to a more recognizable location and rear-
ranging furniture to better facilitate discussion.

According to current A.S. President Donna Bean, 
however, the current organization of the council floor is 
the only way it logistically makes sense.

“We’ve had student input continuously throughout 
the year, regardless of the way the room is set up,” Bean 
said. “I don’t think changing the location away from the 
A.S. offices makes any sense. We used to have it in Price 
Center Ballroom, which was even more intimidating. 
We could maybe have it in a different location once a 
quarter, but I don’t think moving the meeting is going 
to do anything. Move yourself downstairs and educate 
people and let them know where the meeting is.”

Though Brodwin has expressed that candidate Ustav 
Gupta’s plan to “uncage” Sun God is unrealistic, the 
Student Voice! Web site promises to “bring back an 
uncaged Sun God!”

Brodwin said she hopes to improve future Sun God 
Festivals and programming events by increasing student 
input on booking decisions, making sure the headlining 
artists are committed early. 

Overall, Brodwin said she hopes that her experiences 
on the A.S. council will help her overcome administra-
tive hurdles, and that her efforts to reach out to students 
will create a student body that is more involved and 
engaged.

“Coming down to students instead of having the stu-
dents come to us is one of my main goals,” Brodwin said.

will disperse and no single location will become too densely occupied. 

He added that making colleges feel more invested in the Sun God 
Festival would help repair relations between the A.S. Council and college 
councils that have deteriorated in recent years.

“We’ve seen a cutting of ties in the past few years,” he said. “We 
reduced their representation and funding, and now we don’t even try to 
reach out to them for things like the referendum. We just go ahead and 
do it and ask for their vote.”

Gupta also proposed a Bear Garden on the day of the Sun God 
Festival to provide space for legal, contained drinking and to discourage 
drunk driving to the festival from off-campus housing.

A veteran of Khanna’s and Marco Murillo’s presidential offices, Gupta 
was elected A.S. all-campus senator in 2007, and has served on the Sixth 
College Council since 2006.

As an all-campus senator, he worked with the Berkeley-based 
Greenlining Institute to gather signatures for the Students for Tuition 
Relief Now! campaign, which supported the same legislation that is now 
before the California Assembly as the College Affordability Act. The bill 
stipulates a five-year tuition freeze at UC and CSU campuses.

In his role as A.S. associate vice president of student organizations 
this year, Gupta said he has worked to secure funds for organizations 
with unique priorities not covered by the event-based funding process.

These organizations include the Players, a theater group that recently 
requested funding for props, and Books for Prisoners, whose primary 
expense is postage. 

He also helped publicize the effects of last quarter’s student activity-
fee referendum on student-organization funding. 

But on the council floor, Gupta is quiet, and councilmembers have 
suggested he does not engage with student organizations or report back 
to the council as actively as he should.

A.S. President Donna Bean said she worries that Gupta’s academics 
and his editorial position at the Sixth Sense newspaper have undermined 
his council work.

“A majority of the time, [Vice President of Finance Naasir Lakhani] 
has had to pick up his slack,” she said. “He is overstretched.”

Eleanor Roosevelt College Senator Alex Vu, who works with Gupta 
on the finance committee, expressed a similar concern.

“I’ve had to pick up a lot of slack from the AVP of student orgs,” he 
said.

Gupta said that partisanship in the council has been detrimental to 
the working environment.

“Student Voice! has become something very introspective,” he said. 
“A.S. is all about Student Voice!, and I’m running to bring A.S. back to 
the entire student body.”

He said he has received little direction from Bean, and Lakhani has 
not responded to his phone calls or e-mails in recent weeks.

Lakhani declined to comment on Gupta’s performance this year.

“Big Three” experiment in Oakland. 
If Braden fares well against the Angels’ 
lineup, Opening Day will be consid-
ered a success. My guess is that Braden 
will struggle early — as will the A’s this 
season. Oakland is still one year away 
from contention.

With the Nos. 1 and 2 starters 
injured, Joe Saunders takes the mound, 
facing Oakland’s re-tooled lineup. Los 
Angeles hasn’t changed much from last 
season, and after winning 100 games, 
they didn’t have to. The fate of the 
Angels depends on how much the 
offseason moves of Oakland and Texas 
come to light. If the Angels’ No. 3 start-
er can handle an A’s lineup that is no 
longer a complete disaster, Los Angeles 
is well on its way to a three-peat. 

Brewers at Giants
When I went home to the Bay 

Area over winter break, I picked up 
the sports page after the Giants signed 
veteran starter Randy Johnson and got 
a kick out of the headline “Johnson 
makes Giants a Contender.” Seriously, 
a team that has been abysmal for the 
past few seasons because of its repeated 
signings of players who should have 
retired already adds another old guy 
and you call it a contender?

But the NL West may just be medi-
ocre enough to vault the Giants into 
contention after all. Tim Lincecum 
is leading the way, and their starting 
pitching is stellar — Barry Zito fills 
out San Francisco’s fourth spot (where 
he belongs) instead of second or third 
like in past seasons. Still, for the Giants 
to go anywhere this season, the team’s 
young hitters, such as Pablo Sandoval, 
will have to prove themselves. Who 
better to start against than the Brewers’ 
terrible rotation?

TRITONS SET PROGRAM RECORD FOR WINS
By Cameron Tillisch
Staff Writer

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — With a 
sweep of the University of Pacific (30-
19, 30-22, 30-24) on April 3 at RIMAC 
Arena, the No. 10 Tritons (11-13, 7-12 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) 
set school records this week in both 
the number of overall program wins 
and conference wins in a season. The 
Tritons kicked off their final home 
stand in fashion, marking their most 
successful season in conference play. 

“It was an awesome feeling and 
validating knowing how hard we’ve 
worked,” redshirt sophomore out-
side hitter Will Ehrman said. “We’ve 
improved every year since I’ve been 
here.”

Following their historic win, the 
Tritons took on No. 5 Stanford looking 
to continue their conference success, 
but lost in four sets (30-26, 21-30, 
30-26, 30-25).

“We played Stanford really tight but 
in the end, they kicked it into another 
gear,” Ehrman said. “They served a 
tougher game than us and wanted it 
more on defense.”

Despite junior opposite hitter 
Frank Fritsch’s efforts, including a 
match-high 22 kills on .378 hitting, 
the Cardinal (19-8, 12-6 MPSF) over-
powered the Tritons, outhitting them 
at an overall clip of .413, compared to 
UCSD’s .316.

Ehrman also came out strong, fin-
ishing with 19 kills on .289 hitting and 
a team-high 11 digs.

Sophomore middle back Calvin 
Ross and sophomore setter Phil 
Bannan had five blocks apiece. Bannan 
also notched 57 assists to go along with 
three kills.

Stanford opened the first set, taking 
a commanding 10-4 early lead. The 
Tritons came within three points of a 
tie on several occasions, but couldn’t 
close the margin after a 22-19 deficit. 

The Cardinal went on to score five of 
the next eight, taking the first set at 
30-26.

The first minutes of the second set 
could best be described as a tug-of-
war, with the score tying nine separate 
times. But the Tritons hit .594 as a 
team and eventually coasted to a 30-21 
victory.

“We sided out at a really high per-
centage and were able to put a lot more 
serving pressure on them and get them 
out of their system,” Ehrman said of 
UCSD’s second-set run.

After another back-and-forth bat-
tle, Stanford eventually pulled away, 
capturing the third set by a score of 
30-26.

In the decisive fourth set, Stanford 
didn’t mess around, opening for an 
11-6 lead. UCSD fought back to come 
within 23-20 after a Fritsch kill, but the 
Cardinal would not budge, earning the 
overall victory with a score of 30-25.

On Friday night, the Tritons sought 
to make school history in their match 
against University of Pacific (3-23, 0-17 
MPSF), and did just that after bringing 
out the brooms against the Tigers at 
RIMAC Arena. The win marked seven 
for the Tritons in league play and 11 
overall in the season.

Junior opposite hitter Jason 
Spangler led the Tritons with 11 kills, 
while Ehrman added 10 kills of his 
own. As a team, the Tritons outhit the 
Tigers .434 to .136. UCSD also out-
blocked Pacific 7-2.

The first set was tied at six before 
the Tritons went on a 15-6 rampage to 
take a 21-12 lead. UCSD cruised to a 
30-19 win to set the tone of the match, 
hitting .458 while holding Pacific to a 
measly .036 hitting percentage.

The Tritons quickly jumped to a 
10-5 lead in the second set after back-
to-back Ehrman kills and took a com-
manding 23-14 lead after an eight-
point service run led by Frank Fritsch. 
The Tritons sealed the set at 30-22.

In a desperate attempt to force a 
fourth set, the Tigers took a 21-19 
lead in the third, but relinquished the 
advantage after committing several 
errors. The Tritons took advantage of 
the miscues and — with their sights set 
on the UCSD record books — swept 
Pacific by a final score of 30-24.

The Tritons are looking to carry 
momentum throughout their final 
home stand against conference rivals 

CSU Northridge, Cal State Long Beach 
and UC Santa Barbara.

“The top eight teams in our con-
ference make the MPSF playoffs and 
right now we’re in ninth place, one half 
game behind UCLA,” Ehrman said. 
“We probably need to beat UCSB and 
Long Beach State to have a shot.”

With its sweep over Pacific, UCSD set a new program record for wins in a season for the second consecutive 
year. The Tritons bested last season’s mark of 10 wins with four matches still left before playoffs.

ranks second in school history. 
Coming off the team’s impres-

sive performance at UCLA, Salerno 
emphasized the benefits of compet-
ing in large invitationals.

“We really thrive on it,” he said. 
“I think there was a time when it 
might have been intimidating, but 
I don’t think that’s the case now. We 
got some solid results from the team 
standpoint and came out ahead of 
some good, full-scholarship pro-
grams.” 

The Tritons return to UCLA on 
April 9 to compete in the three-day 
Rafer Johnson/Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
Invitational. The Tritons will then 
compete in two more meets on the 
road before returning home for the 
UCSD Triton Invitational on April 
24 and 25. The home meet will be 
the team’s final competition before 
the CCAA Championships at the 
end of the month.

dominant, triumphing over Jennifer 
Chung 6-1, 6-1 at the No. 5 singles 
spot.

“Even though it was only my 
second match of the season, I wasn’t 
really nervous at all,” Saket said. 
“Every day in practice, I’ve just 
learned so much from [senior cap-
tains] Ina Dan and Tessa Tran, and I 
feel like I’ve grown immensely since 
the start of the season.”

Sophomore Roxy Pourmirzaie, 
who competed in only two matches 
as a freshman, had the opportunity 
to play in front of the home fans at 
No. 3 singles. Pourmirzaie showed 
fine form in defeating Marine 
Prevost 6-3, 6-1. 

Senior Rina Nakano was pen-
ciled in for her first singles match 
of the year at No. 4 and didn’t disap-
point, beating Joyce Librando 6-1, 
6-3.

Looking ahead, the Tritons have 
two more regular-season matches 
remaining before the start of region-
al play. 

First up is Point Loma Nazarene 
on April 15 in UCSD’s final home 
match of the season. The tilt will 
mark Senior Day for Dan, Tran and 
Nakano, all of whom have heav-
ily contributed to UCSD’s confer-
ence win streak during their time 
as Tritons. 

UCSD will finish its regular sea-
son on the road against Cal Poly 
Pomona on April 18  — a team the 
Tritons defeated 8-1 earlier this sea-
son — hoping to finish its sixth 
consecutive season undefeated in 

conference play. 
The regular-season matches 

will culminate with the NCAA 
West Regional tournament, which 
begins on May 9. Should the Tritons 
advance, they will compete in the 

NCAA National Championships 
from May 13 to May 16, taking place 
in Altamonte Springs, Fla.

TRACK & FIELD — Competing 
between two of the highest profile 
events of its season, the UCSD track 
and field team took a brief trip to 
North San Diego County last week-
end to compete in the inaugural 
Mangrum Invitational at Cal State 
San Marcos. The low-key meet was 
non-scoring, which gave the Tritons 
a chance to prepare for larger events 
ahead, including the Rafer Johnson/
Jackie Joyner-Kersee Invitational at 
UCLA on April 9. 

“Whenever we’re in uniform, 
we’re going to compete,” men’s 
coach Tony Salerno said. “But when 
there are points on the line, we are 
inclined to cover every event and 
move people around. This was a 
nice event to set us up for events 
coming up in the next few weeks.”

Without the pressure to per-
form at their best, many of the 
athletes competed in fewer events 
or ran distances different than nor-
mal. Nevertheless, junior Casey 
Ryan once again surpassed his own 
school record in the high jump and 
reached the mark of seven feet, an 
exceptional feat for a jumper at 
any level. Senior Sarah Hendy also 
stood out in the field events, tying 
her personal best of 158’4” in the 
discus throw. 

UCSD’s success against local 

opponents comes on the heels of a 
strong showing last week at the Cal/
Nevada Collegiate Championships 
at UCLA. The men finished 12th 
and the women’s team placed fifth 
against a field that included several 
formidable Division-I programs. 

The Tritons were led by sev-
eral outstanding performances that 
ranked among the best in program 
history. 

On the men’s side, senior Scott 
Tsuda took second place in the tri-
ple jump, topping his own person-
al best and setting another school 
record with a mark of 48’ 10.75”. 
The 4x400 meter relay team — com-
prised of senior Bryan Dieffenbach, 
juniors Leon Baham and Wil Dyer 
and freshman Tobias Haswell — 
posted the eighth fastest time in 
school history, taking 11th place. 
Freshman Nick Howe threw 180’6” 
in the javelin, also qualifying for 
eighth best all-time. 

The women were led by junior 
Christine Merrill, who finished sec-
ond in the 400-meter hurdles with 
a time of 58.86, capturing both the 
school record and an NCAA auto-
matic qualifying mark. The Triton 
women also had two third-place 
finishes from a pair of sophomores 
— Bre Schofield in the 1,500 meters 
and Stephanie LeFever in the long 
jump. LeFever’s mark of 18’10.75”

WOMEN’S TENNIS — As No. 10 
UCSD readies to conclude its regular 
season, the Tritons appear primed 
to keep their remarkable streak 
in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play intact. UCSD 
extended its unprecedented run in 
conference to 58 straight wins when 
it defeated Cal State Los Angeles 
9-0 at home on April 4. Despite the 
dominating score, head coach Liz 
LaPlante was still able to find play-
ing time for her reserves, showcasing 
the tremendous depth of talent she 
has at her disposal. 

“With our season quickly com-
ing to a close, I really wanted to let 
some other girls get an opportunity 
to play,” LaPlante said. “I have such 

a wealth of talent to choose from 
when I’m making the ladder, and 
it really showed with the results 
we had against Cal State L.A. The 
Golden Eagles aren’t one of the 
stronger teams in our league, but 
it was still impressive to see the 
way our team continued to compete. 
It’s very rewarding to see our team 
translate all the hard work we put 
in practice onto the court, especially 
against conference opponents.”

All six singles matches were 
decided in straight sets, and after 
solid performance by the three 
doubles teams, the match with the 
Golden Eagles was over after just 
two hours. Sophomores Natalie 
Varnay and Taskeen Bains catalyzed 
the impressive performance with 
their tremendous play at the top 
two singles spots, just as they have 

all season. At No. 1 singles, Varnay 
surrendered only three games to 
her opponent Lana Lamesic, win-
ning 6-3, 6-0, while Bains dispatched 
Adriana Espinosa 6-1, 6-4. Bains and 
Varnay teamed up at the No. 1 dou-
bles position to grab an 8-1 victory 
over Espinosa and Jennifer Chung.

LaPlante used the last four sin-
gles spots to exhibit her team’s array 
of depth and get some action in 
for rookies like freshmen Samantha 
Yeung and Lauren Saket. While both 
are expected to be important con-
tributors in the years to come, they 
both had a chance to showcase what 
the team’s future holds. Saket earned 
the most convincing win of the day, 
a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Crystal Lam 
at No. 6 singles. Yeung was just as 

Though we had to wait a few days longer than usual, the most glorious day of spring 
— Opening Day — is finally upon us. 
Watching last night’s game between 
Atlanta and Philadelphia, which offi-
cially kicked off the 2009 season, 
even Joe Morgan’s ever-clueless com-
mentary (R.I.P. Firejoemorgan.com; 
our dream will come true someday) 
couldn’t ruin my mood. With today 
marking the season’s beginning for 26 
ballclubs, here’s what California’s five 
teams will encounter this season and 
some thoughts on Opening Day. 

Dodgers at Padres
Eighty-four wins were enough for 

the Dodgers to take the NL West title 
last season and they’ll probably be 
enough for a repeat. An enviable blend 
of proven veterans and young talent, 
the Dodgers’ lineup is most definitely 
good enough to battle with Arizona 
for the division crown. Undoubtedly, 
the starting rotation and bullpen are 
Los Angeles’ weak links starting the 
year. Fortunately for the Dodger hurl-
ers, they should get a confidence boost 
playing San Diego to open the season.

The Padres have almost no shot at 
making the playoffs and will probably 
be looking to sell their few working 
parts to other teams later this season. 
With a complete lack of offensive pop 
— no, we’re not yelling “Kouz” at you 
anymore, we’re just booing — the line-
up is in need of a complete overhaul. 
Not even “the little David Eckstein that 
could” has enough heart and grit to 
save this team from a dismal showing.

Athletics at Angels
While the A’s have made no head-

way on building a new stadium — 
make it happen, San Jose — G.M. Billy 
Beane is essentially finished rebuilding 
his team. The only thing left to do 
for the A’s is exactly what they did at 
the beginning of Beane’s reign — let 
a young rotation pitch its way to the 
top. With Justin Duchscherer on the 
disabled list, Braden takes over the 
mound and officially begins the new

In the Cal/Nevada Collegiate Championships at UCLA, the Triton men placed 12th out of 22 teams while 
the women’s team finished fifth out of 24 teams. The host Bruins took first place in both divisions.

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN
Facing a weaker team in a conference that UCSD has dominated for over five years, the Tritons called on 
their bench to compete in singles play and pulled off a 9-0 shutout over the Golden Eagles.
