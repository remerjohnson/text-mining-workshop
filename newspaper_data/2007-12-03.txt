While Dec. 1 marked the final 
day to publicly comment on a revised 
version of the campus’ freedom of 
expression policy, recent allegations 
of unconstitutionality suggest that the 
discussion is far from over.

The new draft of section nine of 
the university properties use policy, 
which defines permitted speech, advo-
cacy and distribution of literature, 
was released during finals week of last 
Spring Quarter. Students received an 
e-mail titled “Review of PPM 510-1 
Section IX” on June 8 that provided 
a Web site link to the new policy and 
asked for input by June 25.

Some students, such as Sixth 
College sophomore Juan Vasquez, pro-
tested the limited comment period 
and argued that the two-week time 
slot — which spanned finals week and 
the start of summer — was not long

For anyone that has had difficulty 
reading another person’s facial expres-
sions, a new technology developed by 
UCSD researchers could recruit the 
help of an unlikely candidate: a com-
puter.

Marian Stewart Bartlett, an asso-
ciate research professor at UCSD’s 
Institute for Neural Computation and 
co-director of the Machine Perception 
Lab, presented her work with auto-
mated computer recognition of human 
facial expressions at a recent digital 
imaging conference. Bartlett uses a sys-
tem called “machine learning” to train 
computers to recognize different facial 
expressions. 

First, the computer detects the face 
and facial features of the subject and

A leading member of California’s 
stem cell research governing board was 
recently criticized for a letter of appeal 
he submitted last summer to reverse a 
board decision rejecting a grant pro-
posal made by his La Jolla research 
group. The alleged conflict of interest, 
meanwhile, has rekindled statewide 
debate over medical researchers’ par-
ticipation in the allocation of their own 
funding.

In August, Burnham Institute for 
Medical Research President and CEO 
John Reed contested the rejection of a 
$638,000 grant that would have gone 
to a Burnham-affiliated researcher. 
Reed sent an appeal to Arlene Chiu, 
chief scientific officer of the California 
Institute for Regenerative Medicine — 
a body governed by the Independent 
Citizens Oversight Committee, of 
which Reed is a member.

John Simpson, director of the 
Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer Rights, is one of several 
individuals calling for Reed’s resigna-
tion, as well as that of ICOC Chairman 
Robert Klein, who advised Reed to 
submit the appeal.

“You can’t kind of shuffle your feet 
and say, ‘Aw, shucks.’ This is serious,” 
Simpson said. “Reed is a wonder-
ful scientist and a good executive at 
Burnham, but I think this is something

that needs to be nipped in the bud 
before it becomes the normal way that 
things are done at the ICOC.” 

Simpson expressed a similar senti-
ment regarding Klein’s involvement in 
the incident. 

“[Klein] gave Reed advice to break 
the law,” he said. “They should both 
go.”

Michael W. Kalichman, director of 
the UCSD Research Ethics Program 
and the San Diego Stem Cell Research 
Ethics Consortium, said that Reed has 
an obvious conflict of interest in the 
matter. However, he said he believed 
that Reed’s decision to send the let-
ter represented a misunderstanding 
of specific regulations rather than an 
error in judgment, and sees no reason 
for any resignations.

“There is nothing on the surface 
that is wrong about having a con-
flict of interest,” Kalichman said. “The 
question is, what do we do when we 
have that conflict? It’s clear that on the 
surface this doesn’t look good, but it’s 
not as black and white as I think some 
people want to portray it.”

Simpson attributed some of the 
conflict to Proposition 71, whose 
November 2004 passage established the 
California Institute for Regenerative 
Medicine and the ICOC. He said the 
committee’s large size and the number 
of appointed members who compete

Price Center, originally designed 
for a university with 15,000 students 
and staff, is doubling in size to fit the 
needs of UCSD’s growing population. 
The renovations, which will be com-
pleted by March, include a new post 
office and computer lab, among other 
additions.

Currently, UCSD enrolls about 
27,500 students and is projected to 
reach 30,000 by 2010. Including the 
newly renovated bookstore and a new 
four-story building, the expanded 
Price Center will increase in size by 
about 175,000 square feet.

University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino said the new food court 
— with eight additional restaurants 
— will feature indoor seating for 375 
people, as well as outdoor seating for

Adjusting to college life, the 
UCSD quarter system and living 
away from home can be difficult for 
any incoming freshman. But trans-
fer students, thrown into UCSD’s 
academic sphere without the ben-
efits of on-campus social network-
ing, often face an even more chal-
lenging experience.

As part of its ongoing com-
mitment to better involve transfer 
students in the campus commu-
nity and enhance their preparation 
for UCSD’s rigorous curriculum, 
the Academic Senate Committee 
on Educational Policy is currently 
scrutinizing its existing seminars 
for transfer students and planning 
for future expansion, according to 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue.

“One of the things I like to say 
about transfer students is, ‘Transfer 
is something you do, not something 
you are,’” Rue said in a Nov. 20 
interview. “After a month, you want 

Senate Focuses Transfer 
Integration on Seminars

to be called a UCSD student, not a 
transfer student.”

Offering transfers a “small aca-
demic experience” that acquaints 
them with campus and student life 
is a necessary step toward alleviat-
ing feelings of isolation, Rue said.

Biology professor and Academic 
Senate Chair Jim Posakony said 
that the committee is not currently 
reviewing any proposals for new 
transfer seminars, but will continue 
examining current course offerings 
until the review is completed.

Currently, all seminars are 
offered through the Transfer Student 
Seminar Program and are reserved 
exclusively for transfer students, 
according to the UCSD Office of 
Academic Affairs. The courses are 
offered during Fall Quarter, graded 
on a pass/no pass basis and count 
for one unit of credit. 

However, only a certain number 
of divisions and departments offer 
the seminars. During last quarter’s 
enrollment period, seminars were 
provided by Sixth College, the 
Division of Biological Sciences, 
and the departments of econom-
ics, political science and sociology. 
Most of the seminars being offered 
address topics such as how to 
access UCSD resources, how to get 
involved in research or internship

Study: Name Initials May 
Affect Academic Success

A person’s initials can influence 
how well they perform in school and 
sports, according to a new study.

Researchers Leif Nelson from 
UCSD and Joseph Simmons from 
Yale University studied the effect of 
first or last-name initials in situations 
where letters corresponded to an 
undesirable outcome.

They found that people whose 
initials matched a negative label per-
form more poorly than others. Nelson 
and Simmons report that baseball 
players whose first or last name starts 
with the letter K, which represents a 
strikeout, tended to strike out more 
often than other players. Similarly, 
students whose names start with the 
letters C or D, which signify mediocre 
marks in grading systems, did not 
perform as well as other students 
with different initials.

“Just having the right initial 
doesn’t make you a better baseball 
player, but it can make you a slightly 
worse baseball player,” Nelson said 
in a press release.

Model UN Ends Quarter 
on a Productive Note
UCSD’s Model United Nations 

had an eventful Fall Quarter after its 
recent reinstatement, holding two 
conferences, winning four awards 
and making plans to attend confer-
ences in winter and spring.

In addition, officer elections were 
held at the end of October,  prompt-
ing an experienced team of leaders 
to join the organization.

Along with plans to take 11 del-

egates to the upcoming collegiate 
conference at UCLA, which will be 
held from Jan. 18 through Jan. 20, 
Model UN will also attend the Model 
United Nations of the Far West 
Conference in San Francisco during 
Spring Quarter.

Model UN’s home conference will 
be hosted next year for high school 
students. The conference offers a 
learning experience for students and 
an opportunity to debate controver-
sial international issues concerning 
the power and effect of the UN in the 
world today.

UC Riverside Student 
Killed by Drunk Driver 
Pauline Samantha Portes, 19, 

was fatally wounded during a free-
way collision with a motorist traveling 
the wrong way on the Costa Mesa 
Freeway on Nov. 30.  

Portes, a UC Riverside junior, 
was headed back to campus from 
a Newport Beach outing in a blue 
Toyota pickup truck driven by her 
boyfriend Steven Nguyen, 19, who 
suffered moderate injuries.  

According to California Highway 
Patrol Sgt. Lydia Martinez, CHP 
received news of a wrong-way driver 
on the freeway at 1:21 a.m.  Two min-
utes later, the collision was reported 
when a gray Nissan Altima driven by 
the suspect collided head-on with 
the pickup.

The 19-year-old woman driving 
the Altima was seriously injured and 
taken to a hospital.  She was arrest-
ed for driving under the influence of 
alcohol and/or drugs, according to 
CHP Officer Denise Quesada. The 
suspect’s name was not immediately 
released.

and impedes public access may war-
rant a permit, she said, but a crowd of 
10 people is not a burden to others in 
a public space.

“[The policy] impermissibly 
restricts speech before it even happens 
by forcing people to reserve the right to 
speak,” Guerrero said.

This limitation has also concerned 
university officials, Brainerd said.

“Ten is a very low number and such 
an approach may not be adopted at 
all,” she said in October. “We will work 
with the committee to establish a more 
reasonable protocol.”

In addition, the same provision 

imposes the unconstitutional respon-
sibility for one person to take financial 
responsibility for others, while granting 
the university “unbridled discretion” 
to deny permits without including a 
deadline on their issuance, Guerrero 
said.

Guerrero added that one of the pol-
icy’s biggest problems is its vagueness, 
such as the stipulation that prohibits 
speakers from making anyone part of 
an “involuntary audience.”

Brainerd said this condition is 
intended to protect listeners from 
becoming audience members without 
their consent.

“While speakers have a right to 
speak, listeners have a right not to 
listen,” she said. “Speakers may not 
take steps that make it impossible for 
listeners not to listen.”

enough and undermined the impor-
tance of freedom of speech.

The comment period was then 
extended to Dec. 1 after Vasquez 
and others mobilized a group of over 
80 concerned students that met with 
former Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson on June 11 
to question the proposed changes.

The university intended to release 
the document sooner and allot more 
commenting time, according to 
UCSD Associate Controller and com-
mittee chair Sally Brainerd, who said 
that the current draft was finalized in 
February but released in June because 
of bureaucratic delays.

The 26-year-old policy has been 
under review since 2001 in efforts to 
bring its language in line with chang-
es in the law regarding freedom of 
speech, Brainerd said. However, many 
aspects of the new policy may actu-
ally threaten the First Amendment 
rights of students and staff, according 
to an eight-page letter submitted on 
Nov. 19 by the San Diego chapter of 
the American Civil Liberties Union.

SDACLU Legal Director David 
Blair-Loy cited case law, contending 
that 10 different sections of the revi-
sion are unconstitutional.

“If their policy as it was written 
went before a court of law, it would 
fail,” Blair-Loy said in the letter.

The first problem with the 
document lies under the heading 
“Reservations,” which states that any 
gathering that can “reasonably be 
expected to attract a crowd of 10 or 
more people” must be reserved one 
business day in advance, SDACLU 
Field and Policy Director Andrea 
Guerrero said.

Guerrero said that this condition, 
referred to as a “prior restraint,” does 
not allow for spontaneous expression 
and is therefore problematic under 
the Supreme Court’s definition of the 
First Amendment.

— David Blair-Loy, legal director, 

San Diego Chapter of the 
American Civil Liberties Union

While the regulation’s purpose 
may be legitimate, the wording as 
it stands is open to content control, 
which Guerrero called a “big no-no” 
in regard to the First Amendment. 
The policy also attempts to restrict 
content by regulating the “political 
activity” of faculty and staff with-
out sufficient justification or clearly 
defined terms, she said.

“It is especially troubling for a uni-
versity, which carries the extra burden 
of encouraging the free exchange of 
ideas, to attempt to restrict the speech 
of the students, faculty and administra-
tors on campus,” Guerrero said.

Brainerd said the current document 
is just a draft, however, and changes 
will be considered once the revision 
committee meets in December or 
January.

According to the latest figures, 
released on Nov. 27, an estimated 
170 people submitted comments in 
response to the new policy, 93 of 
whom were against having any policy 
at all. 

Brainerd said that the policy revi-
sion took a considerable amount of 
time to prepare and that the university 
is in no rush to enact a revised docu-
ment.

The university has not yet released 
a list of committee members because 
several positions have not been con-
firmed, she said, but the group will 
consist of 16 members chosen by 
the A.S. Council, Graduate Student 
Association, Academic Senate, Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs Steven 
W. Relyea and Watson.

“The committee’s goal is to use the 
input it receives from the entire cam-
pus community to formulate a policy 
that upholds the rights of freedom of 
speech while at the same time preserv-
ing and promoting an environment 
conducive to study, research and learn-
ing,” Brainerd said.

160 people. The new design will also 
help alleviate weekday traffic, he said. 

“The footprint of the expansion is 
slightly smaller than the existing Price 
Center, but it does add a basement 
level — which is the loading dock 
— and it has four floors while the 
existing Price Center has three floors,” 
he said. 

Besides the new seating, a comput-
er lab, a post office, a bank, a grocery 
store and a hair salon, there will be 
more office space for student organi-
zations. Spaces have been reserved for 
the Alumni Association, A.S. Council, 
Center for Student Involvement, 
Student-Run Recruitment and 
Retention Center and Cross-Cultural 
Center, which Terzino hopes will unite 
the campus. 

“There will be two new major 
entrances, one from the bus turn-
around at the end of Matthew Lane, 
and one at [the] Myers Drive/Lyman 
Lane intersection across from the 
Student Services Center,” he said. “In 
addition, there will be several other 
convenient entrances to the expan-
sion. I think students will be very 
pleased with the openness and acces-
sibility of the Price Center once the 
expansion is complete.” 

Once the construction is finished, 
many of the offices in the current 
Price Center will be relocated, includ-
ing those of the A.S. Council, which 
will be moving from the third floor of 
Price Center to the fourth.

“With the growth of the student 
population, the expansion seems to 
be able to meet many of the needs of 
the campus,” A.S. President Marco 
Murillo said. “The central location of 
the expansion will hopefully improve 

the connection between students and 
UCSD as many more services will be 
provided.”

According to project manager Jay 
Smith, the design’s basic elements were 
dictated by a poll that was part of last 
spring’s student-initiated fee referen-
dum and incorporated into the Price 
Center expansion project. In addition 
to the ideas presented by architects, 
other design concepts were endorsed 
by members of the Building Advisory 
Committee, two-thirds of whom are 
students. 

“[Some ideas are that] the building 
should be ‘porous’ and allow circula-
tion through it from many directions 
and levels, and connecting the circula-
tion desire lines that exist on campus 
already,” Smith said. “The activities in 
the building should also be visually 
accessible, meaning that what is going 
on on multiple floors should be able 
to be seen from any floor. The central 
atrium was established for this.”

In Price Center’s new atrium, there 
will be a 3,000-square-foot piece of 
artwork by conceptual artist and for-
mer UCSD professor Barbara Kruger, 
designed as a piece of interactive cam-
pus architecture.

“The piece uses a large wall high 
up in the atrium, as well as 30 ter-
razzo rectangles in the floor through-
out the space, and two large LED 
text signs with a continuous streaming 
news feed to include everything from 
international news to surf reports,” 
Stuart Art Collection Project Manager 
Mathieu Gregoire said. “My sense is 
that it will be about time, about how 
every day is completely different but 
also the same, and about how in all 
the busyness of our lives, we guide 
ourselves with certain ideas, and each 

of us is responsible for these ideas.”
The initial overall budget for the 

Price Center expansion, established 
by the BAC in late 2003, totaled $72.2 
million, Smith said.

“[The budget] remained [the 
same] through the development of 
the design and construction draw-
ings, although many ‘value engineer-
ing,’ or cost-cutting sessions were 
required,” he said. “This was because, 
along with real estate at the time, 
construction costs were increasing 
over 20 percent per year in 2004 
and 2005.  When the project was bid 
to subcontractors in 2006, it came 
in another 10 percent over budget, 
so between some more value engi-
neering and additional contributions 
from the funding parties, only $4.4 
million had to be added to the budget 
to raise it to $76.6 million.” 

Smith said the budget is not expect-
ed to exceed that sum. Of the $4.4 mil-
lion that was added to the budget, $3.3 
million came from Student Affairs and 
University Centers.

The ATM kiosk and basement-
level loading dock are already com-
pletely operable, and most of the 
fee-funded areas, which include the 
atrium food court, computer lab and 
group study rooms, are slated to be 
complete in January. The rest of the 
building should be finished around 
the beginning of March. 

“The construction is moving very 
much as planned, regardless of some 
difficult unknown utility issues,” Smith 
said. “We will be taking occupancy of 
95 percent of the facility within 30 
days of the original forecast date.”

Some transfer students, however, 
believe that more in-depth seminars 
could help them overcome the bur-
dens of integration and become more 
immersed in campus activities.

aration would

petitive atmo-
sphere and high 
expectations. 

“I’ll admit 
that I never read 
a book while attending community 
college,” Nelson said.

All-Campus Transfer Association 
President Marwan Azzam said 
there is a general understanding 
that transfer students need a differ-
ent kind of attention.

Each of the colleges at UCSD 
has its own programs to get stu-
dents involved with the campus, but 
Azzam said the main problem is a 
lack of motivation.

“It’s not that UCSD has not made 
the effort to get transfer students 
involved but rather it’s on the part 
of transfer students to get involved,” 

he said.
While Azzam feels that trans-

fer seminars are a step in the right 
direction, he said there would need 
to be something more substantive  
than an orientation-based cirricu-
lum to entice students. Most transfer 
students come into UCSD during 
their junior year, so they are focused 
on attending class and meeting their 

career goals, he 
said. 

Rue agreed with 
Azzam, saying that 
inadequate depth 
led to the rejection 
of some past trans-
fer seminar propos-
als made by indi-
vidual colleges.

“The colleg-
es put some togeth-
er, but they were 
too ‘adjustment to 
college’ and not ac-
ademically robust,” 

she said. “Right now, the main out-
reach to transfers is through the 
colleges, but it’s very hard to do that 
without residence.”

Azzam’s concerns reflect the 
sentiments of many transfer stu-
dents themselves.

“I’d attend the seminars, it would 
be nice if they counted for my degree 
too,” said John Muir College junior 
and transfer student Steven Tang. 
“Actually, if they didn’t I might not 
be motivated enough to go.”

ject’s face. The image is passed to a 
bank of image filters, which prescribes 
patterns of light and dark in a manner 
that computers can understand. 

The image is then passed to the 
machine learning system, which has 
been trained on thousands of expres-
sion models — both positive examples 
of the expression and examples of its 
absence — from the categories in ques-
tion.

“It learns to differentiate the pat-
terns,” Bartlett said.

According to Bartlett, the system 
is precise and accurate because it has 
not been hand-
designed by 
humans. Human 
operators are 
not required 
to distinguish 
between emo-
tions;  instead, 
the machine 
identifies subtle 
patterns from a 
series of images of 
different people 
experiencing the 
same emotion. 
The computer is 
powerful enough to detect which facial 
movements remain the same in all of 
the expressions. 

Gwen Littlewort, Bartlett’s co-direc-
tor and a member of the Institute for 
Neural Computation, said that machine 
learning of this type has been around 
for decades. However, applications of 
the technology are quickly expanding as 
computers become more powerful.

As methods to collect data about 
facial expressions improve, so does the 
capacity to analyze emotions in those 
expressions.

Currently, UCSD’s Machine 
Perception Lab has trained the com-
puter system to recognize joy, sadness, 
surprise, anger, fear, disgust and neutral

tural flaws.

“We’re working with the law as 
it exists, but [CIRM] was designed 
under Prop. 71 with built-in conflicts,” 
he said. 

Kalichman disagreed, saying that it 
is reasonable to grant oversight respon-
sibilities to experts such as Reed.

“The alternative would be to put 
people in who don’t know what the 
best choices are,” he said.

In a Nov. 21 interview with the 
publishers of the California Stem Cell 
Report blog, CIRM Interim President 
Richard Murphy said that since the 
board had already made its decision 
when it received Reed’s letter, the con-
fusion was simple to address and no 
penalty is necessary. 

“As soon as CIRM staff received the 
letter, counsel advised Dr. Reed that 
he must refrain from contacting the 
staff and board members regarding a 
grant to Burnham and advised staff 
to disregard Dr. Reed’s letter,” he said. 
“It therefore had no effect on CIRM’s 
process.”

At the annual meeting of the 
Citizens Financial Accountability 
Oversight Committee in San Francisco 
on Nov. 27, Simpson argued that Reed 
and Klein should step down. State 
Controller John Chiang responded by 
sending a letter to the Fair Political 
Practices Commission requesting an 
inquiry into the allegations. 

“Whether they are perceived or real 
blemishes, we must resolve any conflict 
of interest questions quickly so we can 
protect the important and powerful 
work that is taking place in stem cell 
research,” Chiang said.

expressions.
“We can analyze these facial expres-

sions on two different levels,” Bartlett 
said. “We can recognize emotions or we 
can answer specific questions. Is it real 
pain versus fake pain?”

While humans normally have a 50-
percent chance of guessing whether an 
emotion is genuine, the computer has 
performed significantly above chance 
— showing up to a 72-percent accu-
racy rate.

“Because it can measure 30 [out 
of 46] component [facial] movements, 
it gets information on nearly the full 
range of facial expressions,” Bartlett 

said.
In addition to 

identifying emo-
tions and deter-
mining whether 
they are true or 
simulated, the 
system is also 
capable of rank-
ing their intensity. 
The recognition 
system has also 
been trained to 
recognize facial 
expressions dem-
onstrating fatigue 

or alertness.
Bartlett said the technology can be 

used as a tool for further study in other 
related fields.

“Given that it recognizes facial 
expressions on those dimensions, you 
can learn new relations between behav-
ior and facial expressions,” she said.

Littlewort said that possible uses of 
this technology include social robot-
ics, educational software, software that 
could accurately determine levels of 
pain, tools to recognize deception and 
helpful ways to monitor or train people 
with neurological conditions.

So what is up with those lit-tle Dove chocolates? I’m not just talking about any sweets; 
I mean the tiny, individually foil-
wrapped ones with those cutesy 
“PROMISES Messages” on the 
inside. 

“It’s definitely a bubble bath day,” 
the little blue foil announced as 
I opened it hurriedly on my way 
to class. Actually, no. It’s definitely 
a one-midterm-and-three-papers-
due-this-week day, it’s definitely a 
no-sleep-caffeine-headache day and 
it’s definitely a haven’t-had-enough-
time-to-shower day. 

It is not, however, a bubble bath 
day. In fact, when was the last time it 
was a bubble bath day? Who is  Mars 
Inc. even talking to? Independently 
wealthy stay-at-home moms who 
crave chocolate and take bubble 
baths? 

I’m a 20-year-old full-time col-
lege student with two jobs. I’m busy,  
hungry and I didn’t pay a quarter 
to get some fluffy life advice from a 
candy company. I need a sugar rush, 
not a miniature reminder that this is 
the quarter’s most stressful week. 

But it seems like everything we 
consume has become a wannabe 
fortune cookie, not just chocolate.

Contributing Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — Every day 
spent on UCSD’s congested campus 
makes it more and more difficult to 
imagine a university that could be 
any different. For Tritons, prefab lec-
ture halls, porticoes at Center Hall, 
the anxiety of being on a class waitlist 
and those mysterious hourly chimes 
have all come to be unquestioned 
traits of an institution of learning. 

Another accepted characteristic 
is the proportion of students with 
only one goal in mind: passionlessly 
taking the necessary classes, obtain-
ing a degree and hightailing it out of 
here. As they breeze through general 
education requirements and enroll in 
courses specific to their major, they 
dismiss what may appear to be irrel-
evant classes. In so doing, these stu-
dents unwittingly prevent themselves 
from ever attaining any semblance of 
cultural depth, a highly important 
but grossly ignored component of 
education.  

Granted, it is not an easy task to 
create a curriculum that promotes  
both professional preparedness and 
cultural enlightenment — but it is 
necessary. With solely a vocational 
education one may be successful in 
the workplace, but, let’s face it, peo-
ple judge others by what they say and 
know. Contrary to popular belief, 
cultural fluency is not a mere vehicle 
of pretension but is the key to being 
a respectable adult.   

In contrast to our degree-produc-
ing factory, some schools have  pre-
ferred to focus on the development 
of wordly students. Many, however, 
have taken it to the extreme. 

For example, the curious, some-
what insular, Buddhist-inspired 
Naropa University in Boulder, Colo. 
is a 451-student school that advo-
cates “contemplative education,” the 
idea that higher learning should be 
coupled with meditation in order 
to promote awareness, mindfulness 

and compassion for others. One day 
a semester, classes are canceled to 
encourage students and faculty to 
assemble and participate in an on-
campus, in-group meditation. In that 
same vein, popular majors include 
Sacred Ecology, Indo-Tibetan 
Buddhism, Poetry, Traditional 
Eastern Arts and Sanskrit. 

Given the curriculum’s glaring 
one-sidedness, it is a safe conjecture 
that Naropa graduates are not look-
ing to corporate America for jobs, 
nor are they exposed to an education 
that will make them competitive, 
at least on paper. It is unlikely that 
employers in fields other than aca-
demia or faddish gurudom would 
seriously  consider these degrees. 

Schools like Naropa should real-
ize that an education with a lim-
ited scope does not bode well for the 
professional elasticity or future of 
their students. Indeed, the areas in 
which alumni have managed to find 
work are severely limited: alternative 
therapy, poetry (Allen Ginsberg was 
once a professor), yoga instruction 
and religious healing. Hopefully they 
didn’t take out too many student 
loans. 

In any case, for those seeking 
a more comprehensive curriculum 
and preferring to not dedicate their 
education to the Four Noble Truths, 
nil desperandum: St. John’s College 
is accepting applications. However, 
the coursework at this centuries-
old school is too broad. Students 
undergo a program built entirely 
around an arbitrary list of great 
books — that is, famous scholarly 
compositions in all fields of knowl-
edge that have shaped our world. To 
absorb these timeless texts, students 
do not attend lectures, nor do they 
read mere summaries or analyses 
of these works. They read firsthand 
the unabridged, unadulterated words 
of Aristotle, Shakespeare, Descartes, 
Euclid, Rousseau and other canonical 

UTC Mall Plans Are 
Community-, Eco-Friendly
Dear Editor,

 Your recent article titled “UTC 
Mall Shopping for a Green Makeover” 
outlined many of the improvements 
that are planned for UTC. This letter is 
intended to provide even more details 
on this exciting project.

Westfield initially announced its 
plans to significantly enhance the 
center earlier this year. Since then, 
Westfield has listened carefully to feed-
back from our shoppers and the com-
munity. This input has been valuable in 
helping refine the project. This week, 
Westfield unveiled a dynamic archi-
tectural model (located in the UTC 
Experience at UTC) that provides a 
small-scale, physical representation of 
the new UTC.

 The model, along with images  dis-
played at the UTC Experience, dem-
onstrates how Westfield intends to 
transform the 30-year-old center into 
a world-class shopping, dining and 
entertainment destination. Details of 
the project include 150 new shops and 
boutiques, three new anchor stores, 
five new restaurants, a movie theater 
and a regional transit center.

Westfield has held numerous meet-
ings with community groups and indi-
viduals to obtain feedback on its vision 
for the project, and articles like the one 
that appeared in the Guardian help us 
turn our vision into a concrete plan 
for the new UTC. In addition to being 

a popular shopping and social desti-
nation for UCSD students, Westfield 
UTC is one of the largest employers 
of students in the region, so we highly 
value their thoughts and opinions.

One of the more interesting ele-
ments of the project is that, upon com-
pletion, Westfield UTC will be one of 
the country’s most environmentally 
friendly shopping centers. This will be 
accomplished by bringing energy-effi-
cient technologies, water conservation 
measures and sustainable materials 
into the site. This involves everything 
from the use of “cool roof” technology 
to reduce the urban heat island effect 
to indigenous and drought-resistant 
landscaping to installing a large-scale 
solar power project producing clean, 
renewable energy on-site. Westfield 
also plans to recycle over 50 percent of 
all construction waste and use locally 
sourced building materials to reduce 
and shorten truck trips.

Obviously, traffic and transporta-
tion issues are critically important in 
the community. That’s why Westfield 
is planning to spend in excess of $40 
million to help ease congestion and 
improve flow.  The result is that the 
project will have no significant impacts 
on any of the 59 intersections that were 
studied in conjunction with the pro-
posed project. Dedicated turn lanes, 
reconfigured intersections, widened 
freeway onramps, new traffic lanes 
and signal lights are all a part of the 
traffic improvement plan. This is in 
addition to the proposed regional tran-
sit center that will accommodate the 

future Super Loop and either a trolley 
or enhanced bus-rapid transit system 
in University City.

Thank you for the opportunity to 
provide some additional details on the 
new UTC. Westfield welcomes com-
munity input. We hope you will have 
an opportunity to visit us in person 
at the UTC Experience or our proj-
ect Web site at www.thenewutc.com to 
learn more.

Senior Vice President, Westfield UTC

 
Student Evaluations Pose 

Negative Side Effects
Dear Editor,

The system of student evaluations 
is obviously a useful institution that 
needs to be preserved. It gives students 
power that they would not otherwise 
have, and that goes some way toward 
counterbalancing the institutional 
power professors and other instructors 
have over them. While most professors 
and instructors aim at being as fair, bal-
anced and objective as possible in their 
grading and in their general attitude 
toward students, some do not. Without 
student evaluations, students might be 
at the mercy of the arbitrary behavior 
of these professors, as is sometimes the 
case in other countries. 

However, the institution of student 
evaluations also has serious drawbacks 
that deserve more consideration than 
they are usually given. These evalua-

tions do not constitute or even claim 
to be rational, objective and unbiased 
assessments based on truth and sup-
ported by facts, but are merely subjec-
tive expressions of arbitrary personal 
preferences, whims or resentments. In 
addition, their anonymity precludes 
any sense of accountability on the part 
of the students filling them out. Since 
no other form of feedback is requested 
from them, students are led to believe 
that the proper way to express one’s 
judgment and exercise one’s power is 
through anonymous means that leave 
one unaccountable and exclude the 
possibility of rational public debate 
open to contradiction. 

In other words, student evaluations 
amount to customer satisfaction sur-
veys, and their existence both expresses 
and contributes to creating the prevail-
ing situation in contemporary American 
universities where, just like anywhere 
else, citizens have been turned into 
customers; providers of knowledge or 
services into salespersons; things and 
humans into commodities; and truth 
value into market value. 

In the past I have heard some of 
my non-tenured colleagues state (in 
private) that the aim of their teach-
ing was not for students to learn or 
understand anything but for students 
to be satisfied so that they would write 
positive evaluations, thus ensuring the 
instructor’s continued employment. 
While this degree of cynicism is not 
shared by most instructors, the system 
of student evaluations forces all non-
tenured instructors — and to some 

extent even tenured professors — to 
view their students as customers, their 
teaching as a commodity and them-
selves as salespersons. 

I am not advocating the elimi-
nation of student evaluations. This 
advocacy would be as ridiculous, 
because its implementation would 
be detrimental. What I am suggest-
ing is that a public debate be con-
ducted on the system of student 
evaluations. Ultimately, this system 
involves some of the most crucial 
questions we have to face as mem-
bers of an educational community: 
What is the aim of teaching? What 
is the purpose of a public educa-
tional institution in a market-driven 
world? What are the goals and rea-
sons for being part of the larger 
community to which we belong?

MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Bottle caps, coffee cups and restau-
rant receipts are all great places to 
find these kitschy nuggets of wis-
dom. You certainly didn’t know how 
to plan your day, so let this little 
disposable life coach help — Mars 
Inc. to the rescue!

The problem is, when I open 
a fortune cookie I’m ready for the 
novelty of whatever vague, Yoda-like 
message it holds. But this is just out 
of control. I don’t need someone to 
remind me that I don’t have enough 
time to sleep; I just want a snack.

And while I’m on the subject, 
what about those shopping bags and 
take-out cartons touting Bible pas-
sages at In-N-Out? Anyone who 

really has the good book on hand 
to figure out exactly what John 6:13 
says has probably already gotten 

the message. And let’s get one thing 
straight: I came in here for French 
fries, not a religious experience. 

(And is grease-soaked cardboard 
really the best place for you to praise 
the Lord, anyway?)

I guess the sharpest thorn of it 
all is that these tiny notes are com-
ing from profit-driven commercial 
giants, not some grandmotherly 
adviser trying to help you out. Who is 
some advertising executive to tell me 
how I should spend my free time? 

If anything these blurbs are 
totally contradictory in nature, since 
these companies certainly aren’t tell-
ing their factory workers to take the 
day off and cuddle up by the fire 
with some cocoa.

Come on corporate America, 
give up the charade and stick to 
what you’re good at.

scholars of Western thought. And 
with compulsory ancient Greek and 
French language training, Johnnies 
regularly read and discuss texts in 
their original, untranslated form. 
To add to the mystique, there are 
no exams, no classes over 10 people 
and no grades. 

Alas, with too expansive a curric-
ulum comes absolutely no special-
ization. By graduation, students will 
have completed four years of human-
ities, language and mathematics as 
well as a year of music and three 
years of science. Comprehensive as 
it may be, it is professional suicide 
to educate yourself without any sort 
of concentration. 

Until employers begin seek-
ing workers capable of discussing 
some obscure allegory in Dante’s 
“Inferno,” an erudite mind with lit-
tle understanding of the nuts and 
bolts of modern society has no place 
in current professional spheres. 
Consequently, a great number of 
St. John’s graduates go on to receive 
PhDs and teach. 

This is not to discredit the value 
of a classical education (or the cred-
ibility of professorship, for that 
matter), as these curricula cultivate 
analytical thinking and a thorough 
knowledge of the history of Western 
consciousness. 

Nevertheless, it is doubtful 
whether a St. John’s graduate (or 
an alumnus of any other great-
books school, like Shimer College 
in Chicago) could speak knowl-
edgeably about the latest theories 
in economics and political science, 
or tackle a complex math or science 
problem simply after having read 
a series of antiquated books from 
centuries ago. 

It is time for an institution to 
incorporate elements from both 

schools: A place where equal 
emphasis is placed on rigorous clas-
sical study and world religious prac-
tices, which, in turn, can be com-
bined with a marketable safety net 
of practical, specialized knowledge 
(i.e., one’s major). In other words, 
an environment that molds knowl-
edgeable, worldly and professionally 
prepared citizens of the future. 

It may seem impracticable, 
but some universities have come 
pretty close. Columbia University, 
the University of Chicago and even 
UCSD all have variants of this ideal. 
But there is not enough. 

While it is true that programs    
like Humanities in Revelle College 
and Making of the Modern World 
in Eleanor Roosevelt College can 
be dull for most, it is rare to find 
graduates who think these programs 
are worthless. Because of these 
classes, UCSD students are not only 
endowed with promising career 
prospects, but also the confidence to 
roam with society’s educated strata. 
This is the apotheosis of a mod-
ern education, the healthy mixture 
of scholarship and solid vocational 
preparation. 

With the help of programs that 
highlight a balance between learn-
edness and marketability, life will 
naturally become an unremitting 
quest for culture, knowledge and 
professional gratification. Students 
will begin to dissociate themselves 
from the so-called generation of 
intellectual indifference. But most 
importantly, pre-med students 
will finally have the knowledge to 
explain cubism’s significance in 
the beautiful Picasso original that 
will surely grace the walls of thier 
Beverly Hills mansions.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

Facebook profile, the team joins a growing list of students facing 
disciplinary action for personal information listed on the popular 
social networking Web site. After a Nov. 16 team ceremony in 
which the players gave new members their official nicknames 
— a longstanding club tradition — they hosted a party to cel-
ebrate the start of a successful season. Before long, one team 
member took out her camera and began snapping pictures, 
later uploading them to a Facebook album titled “Psycho 
Initiation.”

The next morning, however, the girls woke up to more 
than just hangovers — an anonymous person had reported the 
Facebook album to UCSD Sports Clubs Program administra-
tors, and teammembers were told they would have to forfeit 
the tournament pending an investigation into the charges. 

Ultimately, the team was charged with five violations, 
including alcohol consumption at a sports club event and 
“rookie initiation” — a claim of hazing based in part on the 
title of the Facebook album. After an unsuccessful appeal 
to the office’s administration, the team was suspended from 
competing for the rest of the year.

“No one was pressured to drink,” Wells said. “There was no 
hazing. It sucks that a girl can want to put up pictures of her 
friends at a social event, and it ruins our season.”

The use of Facebook pictures as evidence of student 
misconduct is relatively rare, and is usually only pursued 
if reported directly to administrators, Director of Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs Tony Valladolid said.

“I’m not going to go out of my way to search for con-
duct code violations on Facebook,” he said. “That’s the same

THE INCRIMINATOR

Instead of competing in the women’s ultimate Frisbee tournament she organized

Staff Writer

An octopus of a city, San Diego’s 
asphalt tentacles sprawl across its 
dusty canyons, making the automo-
bile a valuable 
piece of machin-
ery for residents. 
UCSD commuters 
witness the same 
glorious spectacle 
daily as they leave 
campus during 
rush hour around 
four or five in the 
afternoon — a daz-
zle of flashing red 
lights in a bumper-
to-bumper shuffle 
that can last hours. 

In recent years, an increasing 
number of bikes have popped up 
around campus, complete with slen-
der wheels and flashy colors. This 
biweel revolution is bringing UCSD 

up to speed with the rest of San Diego, 
which has traditionally been known 
by bike enthusiasts as “a biker’s haven,” 
said Kris Wells, operator of the UCSD 
Bike Shop.

The UCSD cycling team is an 
integral part of 
UCSD’s growing 
biking scene, 
part icipat ing 
in competitive 
cycling in San 
Diego and with 
u n i v e r s i t i e s 
around the state. 
The team’s prac-
tices involve 
travels of up to 
100 miles along 
the coast and 
countywide.

But these honed athletes have 
started to share the road with a grow-
ing group of students drawn in by cul-
ture rather than competition. Slowly 
but surely, a younger crowd is intro-

ducing a trend that is well established 
in San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, 
among other places.

“I have noticed, this year more 
than any, freshmen bringing in their 
single-speed and BMX bikes, prob-

ably from the Bay Area where the bike 
culture is much bigger,” Wells said. 

When the administration knocked 
out approximately 100 “S” parking 
spaces this year, many began looking 
for alternate methods of transporta-

tion. UCSD’s Pedal Club has made 
efforts to increase the use of bicy-
cles instead of cars by providing its 
members 10 free parking passes per

approach that all administrators responsible for student con-
duct take. If you bring it to our attention, we use it. [Facebook 
evidence] is just that; it’s evidence.”

However, Valladolid said that like other photographic or 
video evidence, any content posted on Facebook is barred 
from usage for disciplinary purposes until it is authenticated.

“There are all kinds of evidentiary issues with a photo 
or a video, for example,” he said. “How do you know a bong 
contains marijuana? How do you know a red cup contains 
alcohol? If someone is taking pictures or having their picture 
taken while violating the conduct code, it is subject to these 
evidentiary issues.”

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior and Sixth College resi-

dent adviser Justin Lowenthal agreed with Valladolid, saying 
that while he doesn’t specifically look to enforce policy on 
Facebook, it does enhance his awareness of potential prob-
lems.

“I don’t think [discipline based on Facebook] is fair,” he said. 
“It’s a caution factor that I should look at and keep in mind, but 
if I see it, I have not been told to do anything about it.”

A number of other groups in addition to residence life 
monitor the site for incriminating activity as well, including a 
UCSD Panhellenic Council panel that fines sorority members 
identified in compromising situations.

“They’ve always kept a really close check on Facebook,” 
said Revelle sophomore Maggie Milstein, president of Alpha 
Epsilon Phi. “We can’t have red cups, or be dressed scandal-
ously. I even got contacted for some pictures I had up. It hap-
pens all the time.”

Another problem common to Facebook users is the hiring 
process in the professional world, where employers and graduate 
schools tend to check applicants’ Facebook profiles. Valladolid 
confirmed that the trend is a ballooning obstacle for students 
who don’t closely monitor the content on their pages.

“Employers are looking at Facebook, and so are people that 
license,” he said. “I won’t go so far as to say the American Bar 
Association is doing it, but they could.”

The prospect of being judged by the content of a Facebook 
profile is very troubling, and provides extra incentive for users to 
be careful, said Earl Warren College senior Hunter Knight.

“I think a really frightening thing about this is that you might 
think there is nothing wrong with your profile, but any potential 
boss might find something they don’t like, which as a result could 
cost you the job, and you would never know the real reason why,” 
he said.

In response to growing concerns about these issues, UCSD’s 
Express to Success Program commissioned a student-led work-
shop about how to effectively navigate Facebook on Nov. 29. The 
seminar included tips on how to avoid fraud, security breaches 
and situations that could result in disciplinary action.

Though these lessons came too late for the Frisbee team, 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior and team captain Laura 
Wishingrad said that her teammates have learned from their 
mistakes.

“We told our teams after that, ‘Be careful what you put on 
Facebook,’” she said. “I’d be overly cautious.”

Valladolid echoed Wishingrad’s sentiment, saying that while 
the advantages of the site are numerous, so are its pitfalls.

“I think Facebook is a wonderful medium, and [this] gen-
eration will use it to great advantage,” he said. “But, they need 
to be very, very attuned to adverse consequences if they put 
information on there that paints them in a bad light.”

MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  9

By Daniela Kent
Staff Writer

Forehead to forehead, eyes closed 
and hands pressed softly yet assert-
ively together, two tango partners 
spin around the floor of Main Gym 
during the weekly UCSD Argentine 
Tango Club practica. Leading with 
their chests, the men sweep the 
women across the floor in a 
dance that mixes a series of 
basic moves with improvisa-
tion based on the crooning of 
the violin, piano and bando-
neo-infused tango music. Each 
couple has a unique interpreta-
tion of the mood that conveys 
tango as they connect, lean on 
each other and create a flowing 
movement of emotion and per-
sonal expression.

 “[Tango is] kind of an inti-
mate, unspoken conversation between 
two people,” said Justin Ma, a gradu-
ate student and current tango club 
president. 

Ma is one of the many graduate 
students who have found the club to 
be a great opportunity to both practice 
tango skills and socialize with a com-
munity of diverse people. 

“The tango community is very 
international,” Ma said. “Tango people 
tend to be very driven, and it tends to 
be reflected in the professionalism of 
the people that come in.”

The tango club caters to more than 
just UCSD; it also incorporates the 
larger La Jolla community and encour-
ages people of all ages and levels to 
take advantage of the opportunity to 
learn from, and help, teach others. 

“Practica is about showing your 
knowledge with other people,” Revelle 
College senior Parisa Ghannadan said. 
“Everyone has a role of learning and

Reggae by the River
O ff the stern a series of triangular, scrap-sized red, yellow and green flags trailed over the rudder. The running flag flapping in the wind 
behind the boat displayed the same colors, along with 
images of Bob Marley and a regal lion. For another 
in a series of innumerable journeys, “The King of 
Reggae” was headed up the Nile River with a crew of 
three, nine passengers, food for two days and nights, 
24 tall Stella beer bottles and an undisclosed amount 
of Sudanese marijuana.

Feluccas — small, narrow sail-
boats — crowd the Nile’s waters 
in many tourist locations of the 
Egyptian delta. While short rides 
near the port are common, tour-
ists in Aswan, Egypt’s third-largest 
city, can also catch a ride toward 
Luxor, 200 kilometers north and 
home to the Karnak temple and 
the Valley of the Kings. The full ride to Luxor costs 
less than 700 Egyptian pounds ($125), takes a week 
and includes meals. A shorter two-night ride that 
runs $15 to $18 will ferry passengers to Kom Ombo, a 
temple built in the second century B.C. that overlooks 
the Nile. Crocodiles used to bask in the sun where 
tourists arrive today.

“Buffalo Soldier” rumbled from an ancient boom 
box as the single sail, catching wind, slowly eased the 

boat downriver. Across the flat deck of the boat were 
thin mattress cushions covered by a green-and-yellow, 
king-size Looney Tunes sheet. Pillows in matching 
cases held nine cushioned heads along the port and 
starboard sides. An eclectically patterned, multicol-
ored sheet was stretched below the sail, blocking sun-
light from the deck. The chilly river wind blew across 
resting passengers’ faces as the boat traversed the river 
back and forth between banks, creeping forward. 

Mohamed, the boat captain, 
dressed in a black sweatshirt, a 
black baseball cap and dark black 
sunglasses, was the crew’s young-
est at 20 years old. He was also the 
most proficient in English, which 
he picked up not in the classroom, 
but on the river, guiding tourists. 
He and his crew of two lounged 
on the stern, taking turns man-

ning the rudder and smoking Cleopatra cigarettes, an 
Egyptian brand that runs about 20 cents per pack. 

The oldest of the crew, at 23, wore baggy gray 
sweat pants and a loose orange T-shirt. He once had 
to lunge across the boat, a cigarette dangling under 
his short mustache, when the cooking fire toppled 
near the bow and flames leapt from beneath the

teaching.” 
To reach out to all levels of danc-

ers, recreation classes are offered at 
RIMAC Arena that teach beginners 
dance’s basic structure before they 
develop a more free-form practica. 
Eleanor Roosevelt College sophomore 
Samara Kaplan was skeptical about 
going to her first practica, but soon 
found a supportive environment.

“The atmosphere was a little 
daunting at first, because the dancers 
seem so professional ... but once you 
get dancing, everyone is in their own 
world,” Kaplan said in an e-mail.

Luckily for any tango novice, the 
basic concept of the dance derives 
from an act the average student has 
hopefully mastered: walking. However, 
learning to walk with a partner and 
engaging in a lead-and-follow dynam-
ic takes much practice and dedication.

deck.
Mohamed’s other crewmember 

covered his long dreadlocks, which 
hung down over his black T-shirt, 
with a red, yellow and green bandana. 
During a brief stop along the river-
bank he washed dishes in the Nile, 
then went for a swim. From the top 
of a sand dune, a local farmer named 
Ahmed shouted greetings to the three 
young men.

At 50, Ahmed has never been 
on a boat. He’s never been to Cairo. 
He doesn’t speak a word of English. 
With scythe in hand, Ahmed was 
fresh off the field he has farmed 
his whole life. Behind him lies the 
village he has rarely left, a home he 
shares with five wives and 20 chil-
dren under the age of 15. Although 
feluccas have frequently passed, he 
hasn’t met many foreigners. He lives 
a life in stark contrast to those in 
the neighboring Aswan and Luxor 
cities, which have become liberal-
ized and modernized over the years 
by their main source of income, 
Western tourism.

Mohamed and his crew are the 
products of this Westernization. 
Bob Marley, beer, and their general 
party mentality stand as symbols of 
their separation from the tradition-
al Egyptian lifestyle found outside 
the tourists’ paths.

Tourism is such an industry in this 
southern region of Egypt that tragic 
events of the past have caused strict 
regulations on travel. In 1997, terror-
ists gunned down 56 Japanese, Swiss 
and British tourists at the temple of 
Queen Hatshepsut in Luxor. Now, 
all buses, vans and even personal 
cars carrying tourists must travel in 
convoys, with no exceptions. This 
means that all feluccas and cruise 
ships carrying passengers must make 
sure to unload them at a time and 
place suitable for meeting the few 

passing convoys — a difficult task, 
considering that for entirely different 
safety reasons, feluccas cannot travel 
at night.

Instead of continuing upriver, feluc-
cas heading north meet along the river 
at sunset, where the crews and pas-
sengers make camp. Camp consists of 
wrapping a long sheet around the deck, 
creating a bonfire on shore and gath-
ering to sing, play drums and dance. 
On Mohamed’s boat, camp means 
something else as well. His is the boat 
where the crews of other feluccas gath-
er, step inside the small forward room, 
and smoke undisclosed amounts of 
Sudanese weed. 

Climbing into a truck and rushing 
to meet the convoy, it was easy to be 
excited about the coming sites: the 
temple of Kom Ombo, the temple of 
Hatshepsut, Karnak temple and the 
Valley of Kings. It was easy to look 
forward to the warmth of a hotel 
and a hot shower. But stepping off 
the bus into the wind’s soft chill and 
hearing merchants call “where are 
you from,” “looking is free,” “come 
see my shop,” made another night on 
the cold uncomfortable deck start to 
seem pretty nice. 

But this was the last trip of the 
semester, the last adventure before 
many of the study-abroad students 

head home. We were tourists, and 
didn’t have time to spend seeing noth-
ing, lounging, listening to Bob Marley 
and living life like the “King of Reggae,” 
— no matter how peaceful it was. Then 
again, there’s always next semester for 
some of us. 

quarter, as well as three free hours to 
use campus Flexcars, as long as they 
commit to traveling by bicycle for the 
majority of their commuting. 

Though UCSD promotes bicycle 
use, it is really the student — as 
well as local — bicyclists who, in 
the spirit of endorsing bicycling, have 
helped campus interest grow. One 
such enthusiast is Randy Van Vleck, a 
John Muir College senior dedicated to 
bringing the San 
Diegan cycle cul-
ture to life. Van 
Vleck participates 
in the downtown 
Critical Mass 
ritual, an event 
that occurs inter-
nationally on 
the last Friday 
of every month, 
partly in response 
to modern cities’ 
unfriendliness to 
bicyclists.

Critical Mass 
has grown tremendously since Van 
Vleck first joined the movement.

 “I remember in 2005, there were 
only about 35 people present, and the 
ride only lasted about 15 to 20 min-
utes. Last month’s ride had around 
400 people,” Van Vleck said.

In addition, Van Vleck is found-
ing an independent cycling newslet-
ter called Revolve, which will help 
inform San Diegans of events and 
news within the biking community. 
He plans to publish the first issue 
this month. 

Another member of UCSD’s bik-
ing community, Juan Coronado, 
has cycled the streets of San Diego 
for years. A two-year employee of 
Groundwork Books, he started his 

cycling career in the Normal Heights/
North Park area. Once Coronado 
began biking regularly, he noticed 
there were many others who had sim-
ilar interests.

“I started meeting people who 
liked to bike, which made riding an 
even greater experience,” Coronado 
said.  

UC Cyclery on La Jolla Village 
Drive is also a major hub for cyclists 
around UCSD. Though it is a run-

of-the-mill bike 
retail store, it fea-
tures weekly rides 
open to anyone that 
start from the store 
on Sundays at 6:30 
p.m. and use trails 
through the windy 
paths on campus.

“Just by a guess, 
I’d say that about 20 
to 30 percent of our 
customers are stu-
dents,” said Casper 
Rubalcava, a UC 
Cyclery employee.   

Although the layout of University 
City keeps most residents strapped 
into their cars, riding a bike around 
town has become a participatory activ-
ity for friends. 

“At a lot of band shows, cafes 
and whatnot you’ll definitely see 
a good amount of hip kids who’ve 
brought themselves there by bike,” 
Coronado said.

Like many other pastimes, bicy-
cling serves as a networking tool. 
This subset of alternative athletes 
enjoys transportation away from 
San Diego’s stacked freeways and 
around fellow bikers.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  11

In order to advance to moves such 
as leg wraps and spins, every stu-
dent must first learn the basic steps. 
Beginners must master the crusada, 
ochos, molinete, weight change and, 
perhaps most importantly, a consis-
tent frame posture. 

 “There are opening moves … but 
then [the moves] take you to differ-
ent places,” said Maziar Nezhad, a 
graduate student and former tango 
club president. “There is an element of 
randomness.”

The tango is a naturally explorative 
dance, and mastering the initial tech-
niques prepares dancers for all sorts of 
possibilities.

“[Tango] is really diverse because 
the motions you go through when 
you’re dancing goes from playful to 
sad to dramatic,” Ma said. “It runs the 
gamut. I like that variety.”

 The uniqueness of a tango dance is 
accredited to the combination of two 
partners sharing their common knowl-
edge and style since the male leads and 
the female follows. 

“It’s an interaction of invitation and 
acceptance,” Nezhad said.

Because the dance itself is so rhyth-
mic, music plays a crucial role in the 
dance’s movements and mood.

“A great deal of the pleasure of the 
dance comes from the connection to 
the music,” Nezhad said. “If [the con-
nection] is not there, then it’s just a 
bunch of moves that don’t really make 
sense. When there is this connection 

to the music, then it all kind of falls 
in place.”

Because music is an integral part 
of tango, Ma encourages students to 
get involved with the club through 
DJ opportunities in addition to danc-
ing. The practicas revolve around 
a sequence of tango music that can 
invoke different feelings and emo-
tions from the dancers; students can 
approach tango through appreciation 
of its music, which ranges from classi-
cal slow and romantic tango to a large 
range of modern adaptations called 
“nueva” tango, which Ghannadan 
describes as “tango with a ghetto 
beat.”

The tango club also hosts events 
such as demo dances, in which two 
partners showcase their tango skills to 
audiences during events ranging from 
campus activities to La Jolla cultural 
fairs. Promoting the club has become 
increasingly important to members.

As a free opportunity to both learn 
and teach, the tango club provides 
a place for anyone and everyone to 
explore their interest in the dance, 
music and culture.

“What is so unique about tango 
is how smooth the movements are,” 
Kaplan said in an e-mail. “There is 
such a passion that comes out of you 
when you tango, especially when you 
close your eyes and let your body just 
move around the space.”

points and four rebounds in 18 min-
utes off the bench. 

UCSD shot only 35.4 percent 
from the field during the game, 
but made 45 percent of their three-
point attempts, including 6-of-9 in 
the first half. A tremendous Triton 
defense limited Chico State’s sec-
ond-chance opportunities, holding 
the Wildcats to 34.1 percent field-
goal shooting and 2-for-15 shooting 
from long distance.

The Tritons’ trend of striking first 
began against Cal State Stanislaus 
the night before their game against 
Chico State, as senior guard Clint 
Allard opened the contest with a 
three-pointer, hit a second less than 
two minutes later and scored eight 
of UCSD’s first 10 points in just over 
four minutes. 

Allard’s early streak helped the 
Tritons to a 12-point lead in the first 
half. The Warriors were able to cut 
that advantage with a three-pointer 
before the end of the first-half, leav-
ing UCSD with only a six-point 
advantage heading into the locker 
rooms.

The Tritons came out of the gates 
hot again, building an early 13-point 
lead, 38-25, less than three minutes 
into the second vhalf. However, it 
would be UCSD’s largest lead of the 
half as the Warriors hung around 
and pulled within four at the 7:23 

mark. 
The teams would battle over the 

next five minutes, with UCSD lead-
ing by as many as six and Cal State 
Stanislaus getting as close as two. 

The Warriors had numerous 
chances to make it a one-point 

game, including a layup attempt 
that junior forward Darryl Lawlor 
blocked, but were still unable to 
convert several put-back attempts 
on the same possession. 

Cal State Stanislaus would even-
tually bat the ball back outside to 
reset, but Allard picked off a pass 
and drove for a layup to put the 
Tritons up by five. 

Allard, UCSD’s second lead-
ing scorer and the team’s leader in 
rebounds and assists, said the team’s 
veterans are now more poised to fin-

ish a game strongly.
“We have a lot of experience 

this year and as long as it’s close 
at the end I feel really confident,” 
Allard said. “Now we don’t want to 
be close in the end in every game 
… but when it’s close, we have the 
experience, the leadership and the 
ball handling to be able to take care 
of [the game].”

That experience and leadership 
was on clear display in the contest’s 
final two minutes when, following 
a Warrior jumper, junior forward 
Henry Patterson grabbed an offen-
sive rebound, drew a foul and made 
two free throws to regain a five-
point advantage. 

Cal State Stanislaus pulled within 
one point following a three-pointer 
and a layup, but Kim scored UCSD’s 
final three points from the free 
throw line, including two with nine 
seconds to play, and the Tritons 
defense heavily contested Stanislaus’ 
final shot to seal the home opening 
win.

Head coach Chris Carlson 
praised his team’s perseverance and 
ability to close out the game.

“When things really started not 
going our way, we could have caved 
in and we didn’t,” he said. “We sucked 
it up and got stops when we really 
needed to. That was the most impres-

The Padres inked the deal with 
Wolf after seeing big free agents go 
elsewhere to more lucrative markets 
— A-Rod went sniffling back to the 
Big Buck Bronx 
Bombers and 
Torii Hunter 
went West to 
the Los Angeles 
team that 
doesn’t really 
play in L.A. The 
Angels gave 
Hunter around 
$80 million to 
spend five years 
patrolling cen-
ter field, much 
more than the Padres could offer to 
replace the departing — and now 
suspended — Mike Cameron in 
center field.

Signing Wolf finalizes a rota-
tion that should again be one of 
the best in the majors, along with 
Jake Peavy, who is reportedly set 
to agree to a three-year extension, 
Chris Young, Greg Maddux and 
either Clay Hensley or last-year’s 

impressive rookie Justin Germano.

Allard, showcasing all facets of 
his game after his early scoring out-
burst, finished with a double-double 
of 14 points and 10 rebounds, while 
also helping to get his teammates 
involved with five assists, as well as 
adding two steals and a block for 
the Tritons. 

Kim also scored 14 points, adding 
three rebounds, three steals and two 
assists. The Tritons won the battle 
on the boards 36-28, and shot 45.8 
percent from the field, while holding 
Cal State Stanislaus to below 40 per-
cent field-goal shooting, as Carlson 
earned his first career head coaching 
victory in the regular season.

“They’re a special group of young 
men and I really, really enjoy being 
the head coach here,” Carlson said 
“It’s all because of them, it all starts 
and ends with good players.”

UCSD continues its current five-

University of Alaska-Fairbanks at 
7 p.m. The Tritons will then return

HOT CORNER

MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2007

Let’s start with the Bolts, because it’s football season and, although no one expect-
ed it to be this close, the Chargers 
are in a battle to hold onto the 
AFC West lead. With a 24-10 win 
in Kansas City over their division 
rivals, the Chargers have a two-
game cushion between them and 
the Broncos and a three-game lead 
over the Chiefs and Raiders. With 
four games left to play, everyone 
in the AFC West is a contender 
and despite a good performance in 
their latest Sunday showdown, if we 
have learned to hate anything about 
this year’s Chargers, it’s their flare 
for inconsistent 
performances.

As I said in 
a recent col-
umn about the 
Chargers and 
their lucky win 
over the Colts, 
this team needs 
Phillip Rivers 
and LaDainian Tomlinson to work 
together to see consistent success. 
While the win over the Chiefs wasn’t 
ideal for Rivers — he was just 10-of-
21 for 157 yards with a touchdown 
pass and a pick — Tomlinson ran 
wild for 177 yards on 23 carries 
and reached the end zone twice in 
the second half on dashes of over 
25 yards. 

Though Rivers wasn’t impres-
sive, to his credit he only threw one 
pick and was able to spread the ball 
around to six different receivers. 
The shocking thing is that his usual 
target, All-Pro tight end Antonio 

Gates, had only one catch, on which 
he lost a yard. 

Gates will never be limited to 
just one catch in successive weeks. 
Norv Turner should focus on him 
early and often, unless he has no 
head coaching skills — which is 
indeed a possibility. 

At least the Chargers’ destiny is 
in their own hands, which is more 
than many good football teams can 
say, but their remaining schedule 
leaves many possibilities open. 

Next week, the Lions’ high-
powered passing attack will test 
the recently recuperated Quentin 
Jammer and rest of the Charger 

secondary. The 
Bolts will then 
host the Broncos 
on Monday night 
in Week 16 in a 
possible division-
deciding contest 
before making 
a journey to the 
Black Hole in 

Oakland to battle the Raiders to 
close out the regular season. 

Luckily for LT and the Chargers’ 
hopes, all three upcoming teams 
have shoddy run defenses; and with 
Tomlinson finally looking like he 
was during his MVP and record-set-
ting season last year, he could carry 
the team into the playoffs, where 
anything can happen.

On the baseball side of San 
Diego, the Padres made their first 
splash into free agency, signing vet-
eran southpaw Randy Wolf to a one-

CCAA Wins Push UCSD’s Perfect Record

By Janani Sridharan
Senior Staff Writer

After five straight wins to open 
the season, the No. 4 UCSD wom-
en’s basketball team continued its 
success with a 60-46 win over No. 
8 Chico State on Dec. 1 and a 77-58 
victory over Cal State Stanislaus on 
Nov. 30. The wins put the Tritons 
at 7-0 overall, the best start in the 
program’s history.

The Tritons faced undefeated 
rival Chico State in their second 
home game this season. The bat-
tle started out close, as would be 
expected of two teams that split 
their last 16 games against each 
other.

The Tritons scored the night’s 
first two baskets to take a 4-0 lead, 
but both offenses committed numer-
ous early turnovers and struggled to 
run offensive plays.

With the score tied at eight and 
14:56 left in the first half, the Tritons 
went on a 13-2 run to take a 21-10 
lead, with back-to-back three-pointers 
by senior guard Kaycie Bull and soph-
omore guard Annette Ilg capping the 
Tritons’ run. The Wildcats answered 
back with 7:45 left in the first half, 
outscoring the Tritons 15-4 and tying 
the game 25-25 at halftime.

The second half started out just 

like the first, with both teams fighting 
hard for each basket against tough 
defenses. The Wildcats took their 
first lead of the night with 15:45 left 
in the game when a layup put them 
ahead 31-29. On the ensuing posses-
sion, junior forward Michelle Osier 
hit a midrange jumper for UCSD, 
starting another Triton run that last-
ed for most of the half.

With senior forward Alexis 
Mezzetta playing point guard for 
much of the second half, the Tritons 
were able to set up their offense and 
feed the ball to Osier and senior 
center Alexis Gaskin in the post. 
Using their offensive plays, the 
Tritons were able to pull away from 
the Wildcats for the win. 

“In the second half, we were able 
to run our plays and get any shot 
that we wanted,” Mezzetta said. 

UCSD also changed its defense 
in the second half to help stop Chico 
State.

“On defense, we alternated 
between man-to-man defense and 
zone instead of playing straight man-
to-man like we did in the first half,” 
head coach Charity Elliott said.

The Tritons were also able to put 
Chico State in foul trouble during 
the game, forcing the Wildcats to 
bench their starters and eventually 
causing Wildcat forward Amanda 
Monteith to foul out. 

UCSD was strong on the boards, 
limiting Chico State’s usual domi-
nance on the glass.

“Rebounding was a big key in 
this game,” Elliott said. “Chico State 
usually outrebounds its opponents 
by about 19, but we outrebounded 

them in this game.” 
Osier led the Tritons with 19 

points and added seven rebounds. 
Gaskin added eight points and 
eight rebounds, while senior guard 
Meaghan Noud grabbed seven 
rebounds to help give the Tritons a 
40-34 edge in rebounding.

The Tritons’ first home-court 
game was a good one, as they capital-
ized on many mistakes in a sloppy 
game from Cal State Stanislaus. The 
Tritons took control right away, scor-
ing 26 of the 
game’s first 
30 points. 
Gaskin had 
key rebounds 
for the Tritons 
both offensively and defensively, and 
the UCSD defense kept the Warriors 
in check by forcing them to make 
turnovers. 

The Tritons took a 33-20 lead at 
halftime that they held for the entire 
second half. The UCSD squad was 
able to score easily with a simple 
motion offense against Cal State 
Stanislaus. 

Noud led the Tritons in scoring 
with 14 points and Osier added 13 
points while grabbing six rebounds. 
Gaskin also netted 12 points and 
added five rebounds including three 
offensive boards.

After the two conference wins, 
the undefeated Tritons will go back 
on the road to play three non-confer-
ence games against Grand Canyon 
University on Dec. 16, Central 
Washington University on Dec. 18 
and Western Washington University 
on Dec. 19.

Tritons Never Trail in Two Wins

By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer

The UCSD men’s basketball team got off to a strong 
conference start at home this weekend, defeating Cal 
State Stanislaus, 63-60, on Nov. 30 and Chico State, 
65-55, on Dec. 1. The Tritons did not trail in either 
game but had to hold off furious comebacks from both 
teams, improving their record to 2-2 overall and 2-0 in 
California Collegiate Athletic Association play.

After an 8-0 UCSD run opened the game against 
Chico State, the Wildcats tied things up at 10 at the 11:50 
mark of the first half. The Tritons then converted four 
three-pointers over the next three minutes, two coming 
from junior guard Kelvin Kim, to key a 13-0 run. The 
Wildcats scored only five points in over nine minutes in 
the first half, as the Tritons’ stifling defense held Chico 
State’s leading scorer Darroll Phillips — averaging over 
20 points per game on the season — scoreless through 
the first 18 minutes of the contest. UCSD extended its 
lead to as much as 21 points in the first half before tak-
ing a 40-23 lead into the break.

The Wildcats chipped away at UCSD’s lead in the 
second half, capitalizing on a series of Triton fouls 
and pulling within single digits after two Phillips free-
throws with 9:42 left in the game. Chico State came 
within one possession following a successful three-point 
play with just over three minutes left, but sophomore 
guard Jordan Lawley knocked down a huge three-
pointer on the following possession and added two free 
throws down the stretch, as UCSD converted six of eight 
shots from the line in the final minute-and-a-half to seal 
the victory.

Lawley said UCSD’s fourth win in the last five meet-
