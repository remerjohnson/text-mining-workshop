UC EAP 
Receives 
Federal 
Grants

BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

Studying abroad will now be 
cheaper for some UC students due to 
over $800,000 in new federal grants. 
The UC Office of the President 
announced Jan. 19 that 215 Gilman 
Scholarship students from across the 
UC system would each receive up 
to $5,000 from the U.S. Department 
of State’s Bureau of Educational and 
Cultural Affairs to earn units while 
studying abroad as part of the UC 
Education Abroad Program.

“The success for UCEAP students 
results in a significant financial contri-
bution to the University of California 
and is a testament to the quality of the 
UC education system as well as the 
students themselves,” Associate Vice 
Provost and Executive Director of 
UCEAP Jean-Xavier Guinard said in 
a UCOP statement.

According to its website, Gilman 
Scholars must be UC students, already 
receiving a Federal Pell Grant and 
planning to study abroad for at least 
four weeks. Applicants go through an 
application process, which includes 
submitting an essay. This academic 
year, 34 UCSD students were named 
Gilman Scholars.

According to the UCSD Program’s 
Abroad Office, approximately 1,200 
UCSD students are expected to study 
abroad in some capacity in 2011-12.

UCSD Programs Abroad Office 
Director Kelly O’Sullivan said the 
federal grant would help many stu-
dents with financial troubles that may 
otherwise have prevented studying 
abroad.

“We are extremely appreciative 
of the State Department’s commit-
ment to the Gilman Scholarship 
Program, especially in light of the 
fact that 40 percent of UC San Diego 
students who study abroad rank as 
High Need for financial aid eligi-
bility,” O’Sullivan said. “Our office 
has increased the number of Gilman 
Scholarship information sessions and 
scholarship essay writing workshops 
to improve the competitiveness of our 
UC San Diego students’ applications.”

Alexander Stern, a fourth-year stu-
dent at UCSB, is suing the University 
of California after he was unable to 
receive a job at the university due to his 
disability. The lawsuit Andrew Stern 
V. Regents of University of California 
prevents disabled students under the 
Disabled Students Program from 
receiving university jobs.

In response to Stern’s lawsuit, 
UCSB officials announced that the 
DSP has modified its policies to aid 
disabled students in receiving jobs.

“As of January 26, student clients of 
DSP will join all other undergraduate 
and graduate students in being able to 
immediately access the department’s 
online applications for the student 
note-taker and test-proctor positions 
at DSP,” UCSB News Director George 
Foulsham said in a statement.

According to a Jan. 25 article in 
The Bottom Line, Stern said that the 
director of the Disabled Students 
Program Gary White claims that hir-
ing an individual with disabilities cre-
ates additional liabilities and his job is 
to minimize potential liabilities.  

Although the 1990 American 
Disabilities Act made job discrimina-
tion against individuals with disabili-
ties illegal, Stern claims that the uni-

UCSB student claims 
system discriminates 
against hiring those 
with disabilities.

DIVISION I   NEW CONCERNS OVER COUNCIL’S NEUTRALITY

Davis Spent $100K on Crisis Consultant
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

UC administrators reportedly spent six figures 
on a media crisis consultant to assist with UC 
Davis’s response to the infamous pepper spray 
abuse incident last November.

UC spent $100,000 to hire a consultant to help 
with damage control after a UC Police officer 
doused a line of “Occupy UC Davis” protesters, 
damaging the university’s image and angering 
many people worldwide.

According to the Davis Enterprise, the consul-
tant — a senior member of Marsh Risk Consulting 
— arrived on campus several days after the video of 
the incident surfaced and helped the university plan 

a response to the issue. UC Office of the President’s 
Associate Vice President of Communications, Lynn 
Tierney, suggested that UC Davis hire the consul-
tant because the university was hit unexpectedly 
with the issue.

“In that situation, when you have the kind of 
worldwide attention they had at Davis, it would be 
easy to put out misinformation if it wasn’t well-con-
tained,” Tierney told the Enterprise. “We wanted to 
make sure we got the most timely information to 
the right audiences.”

Some students at UC Davis were bothered by 
the fact that funds were used to preserve the UC 
Davis image rather than applied toward other 
areas.

“I would have rather the money go towards 

education,” UC Davis protester David Roddy told 
CBS Sacramento. “I think it just reinforces the 
position of the protesters here that the administra-
tion is willing to throw money around as long as 
they don’t face the actual problems that are facing 
students.”

CBS also reported that the money used to cover 
the consultant’s fees came out of a fund reserved for 
insurance costs.

UC President Mark G. Yudof had previously 
announced that former LAPD Police Chief William 
Bratton would lead a full investigation into the inci-
dent. The full report will be released Feb. 24.

Student leaders question the 
feasibility of the D-I 
referendum after an 
anonymous email surfaces.
BY NICOLE CHAN
Associate News Editor

A.S. Vice President of External Affairs Samer Naji admitted to showing a letter, suppos-edly written by a student athlete, to students 
before it was leaked to Facebook. The letter, which 
began circulating Wednesday night, alleges collab-
orative efforts between A.S. Council and the Athletics 
Department towards securing the Division I referen-
dum vote. 

The referendum was approved by Vice 
Chancellor Penny Rue Feb. 2 and first passed by  
A.S. Council during Week 3.  

“If students are doing this alone, it’s fine,” Naji said 
of the letter. “If campus administration was trying to 
skew the vote, there’s a big problem with that and I 
think that’s something worth looking at.”

Naji said he first saw the letter posted in A.S. 
Council’s private Facebook group. According to Naji, 
an unnamed A.S. councilmember received the letter 
and then decided to share it with A.S. Council. 

“I don’t think there was the willingness of A.S. 
[Council] to look into administrative influence on 
the election, so I figured students should look at it,” 
Naji said.

Naji, who ran as a member of A.S. President 
Alyssa Wing’s “Board the Wing” party, said he does 
not support a move to Division I sports because of 
the potential effects of added student fees.  

“Personally, as a student, I am against the move 
to Division I right now, just because I don’t think a 
lot of people can afford that fee,” Naji said. “When 
the economic situation gets better, I think we 
should consider it.”

A.S. Council will enact a neutral education 
campaign starting today through the voting peri-
od. According to Wing, the A.S. election commit-
tee decided to expedite its education campaign 
in a response to student inquiry and last week’s 

leaked letter. 
The election committee, which is composed of 

representatives from each of the six colleges, will 
work with the advocate general to educate students 
on the special election and the referendum itself. 

“That message that was ‘leaked’ was completely 
unaffiliated with A.S. Council, or anyone who 
is involved with any campaign or the athletics 
department,” Wing said. 

Wing said she did not try to keep the let-
ter private, but said she wanted to investigate it 
before bringing it to the student body’s attention.  
    “The VP External decided to go public with it 
and started publicizing all over Facebook,” Wing 
said. “That’s where there’s definitely miscommu-

nication. The conversation with the VP External 
wasn’t don’t publicize it, but was let’s actually figure 
out if this message has merit before we release it. 
For the sake of our association and the legitimacy 
of our body, we shouldn’t go without knowing the 
facts.”

Wing said she has been speaking with members 
of the athletics department to ensure the election 
remains democratic.

“I’ve been speaking with athletics to make sure 
they aren’t doing anything that’s against the rules 
to violate procedures of fair and free election, and to 
make sure it is driven by students and not adminis-

UCSD SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA

▶ UCSD was recently ranked 11th in the nation 
on the Peace Corps’ annual Top Colleges list. 
In 2011, 78 UCSD alumni became Peace Corps 
volunteers — an increase of 16 percent over last 
year when UCSD was ranked 14th. 

▶ Assistant Vice Chancellor Mounir Soliman 
headed a UCSD delegation to meet with Vice 
Rector for Academic Affairs, Dr. Nassar M. 
Shaikh at Prince Mohammad bin Fahd University 
in Saudi Arabia. The two parties discussed a 
continued future relationship between the two 
schools, which would include combined research 
activities and academic exchange programs. 

▶ Last Tuesday, UCSD officials announced that 
the purchase of the Nevada Cancer Institute was 
finalized. UCSD spent $18 million in the deal that 
will create the first UC-owned medical property 
outside of California. 

▶ Eight Navy sailors were discharged over the 
weekend following a hazing incident that occurred 
on an assault ship based in San Diego. The sailors 
had assaulted and choked a sailor who was new to 
the department last month as part of an initiation 
ritual. 
 
▶ A Sunday morning fire caused an estimated 
$100,000 in damage to a house in San Diego’s 
Fairmont Park neighborhood. No injuries were 
reported and the cause of the fire is under 
investigation. 
 
▶ The San Diego office of Susan G. Komen for the 
cure received death threats after deciding to cut 
funding for Breast Cancer Screenings at Planned 
Parenthood. The Komen Foundation has since 
reversed its decision. 
 

▶ A 54-year-old Sacramento woman is facing 
child endangerment charges after she left her 
one-year-old grandchild alone in a car seat on a 
sidewalk with an open bottle of brandy.
 
▶ The Picayune Rancheria of the Chukchansi 
Indians and the Pala Band of Mission Indians, 
both tribes that operate casinos, cut off dozens 
of members from profit-share because of 
disqualifications in bloodlines.
 
▶ Officials believe a young Los Angeles girl was 
sexually abused by two different teachers who 
were both arrested this week. The girl, who was 
in second grade when she was first touched 
inappropriately, is one of at least 23 victims 
between the two teachers. One of the offenders, 
61-year-old Mark Berndt, allegedly spoon-fed his 
own semen to several of his victims.

trators,” Wing said. ”I’ve heard from 
many athletes that they are appalled 
that someone would write something 
like that.”

 Approximately 110 students have 
responded to the Division I debate 
by organizing a Facebook group 
called “UCSD Students Against the 
D-I Referendum.”

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Kevin Quirolo, who drafted 
“D-I: Not Now” for the Facebook 
group, said that current efforts to 
inform students about the referen-
dum have been the main response.

“I don’t think [the letter is] rep-
resentative of A.S. [Council] or ath-
letics necessarily,” Quirolo said. “It’s 
just really hard to really say how 
authentic it is, who really wrote it, 
or what their interests were. I’m just 
trying to ignore it. It doesn’t have to 
do with whether I should vote for 
something.”

Quirolo said that although there 
has not been an organized effort 
against Division I yet, students are 
focusing on getting information and 

educating others on the potential 
effects of the referendum.

“I’ve talked to two people who are 
athletes who supported D-I,” Quirolo 
said. “But when they started looking 
into it more and asking themselves 
what entailed in this particular ref-
erendum, they changed their minds 
about it. For me, it says it’s an issue of 
how much information people have.”

According to a March 2011 uni-
versity feasibility study by Athletics 
Staffing & Consultants, UCSD would 
need to increase the athletics bud-
get by approximately $12 million in 
order to be competitive in the Big 
West Conference. 

The study recommends for the 
university to find new sources of 
funding; such as institutional sup-
port, out-of-state tuition waiv-
ers, a new student assessment and 
game guarantees. Guarantees are 
money paid by other universities in 
exchange for UCSD teams to play at 
their campus.

Both Quirolo and Naji said stu-
dent awareness of the referendum is 
the most important issue.

“I think not enough people even 
know there’s going to be a vote on 
this issue,” Naji said. “As of now, I 
just thought it would be good for 
students to see the letter and what’s 
in the background.”

Wing said last week’s events are 
evident of general misinformation 
on the referendum and hopes that 
the educational campaign will help 
students make informed votes.

“Our strategy is to increase voter 
turnout, not to impede on the fair 
and free election process,” Wing said. 
“We want to make the election go 
smoothly, that the new election code 
is followed and that students have the 
information necessary to make an 
educated vote.”

Voting on the Division I referen-
dum will begin Monday, Feb. 27 and 
continue until Friday, March 9.

Athletic Director Earl Edwards 
and AVP of Athletic Relations Aurora 
Lopez could not be reached for com-
ment as of press time.

versity application process does not 
inquire about the skills of a disabled 
individual.

“They have an extremely wide 
and broad definition of disability 
and you can see that very easily 
because if you just simply go to 
their site, press one button indicat-
ing that you might have a disabil-
ity, that’s when the flagging process 
starts,” Stern said. “And from that 
point on is when you’re denied the 
jobs.”

Stern pursued the lawsuit after 
he discovered that he could not be 
hired due to his disability. Under 
this policy, someone who has cancer 
would face the same job discrimina-

tion as Stern or other disabled yet 
qualified applicants. According to 
Stern, a disabled veteran or cancer 
patient could be denied a position 
despite being qualified.

“A disabled veteran or a cancer 
patient would be refused so much 
as consideration for one of these 
jobs.” Stern said. “One such job is 
the ‘test proctor’ position, which 
merely requires the employee to 
monitor one or a few students to 
see if they are cheating. Clearly, not 
each of the 54 million Americans 
with a disability should be deemed 
presumptively unqualified for this 
type of job.”

Stern filed the lawsuit in October 
2011. The University of California 

is asking the judge to eliminate 
Title II of the American Disabilities 
Act, which states that public agen-
cies cannot refuse to hire someone 
based exclusively on a disability.

“I’m not asking for affirmative 
action,” Stern said. “I don’t believe 
that anyone with a disability should 
be automatically entitled to a job, 
nor do I think that they have any 
more right to that job than a non-
disabled person. I simply requested 
that they not look at one single word 
tied to their identity: disabled.”

Stern and White could not be 
reached for comment as of press time.

QUICK TAKES

Every time Facebook forces radical change on its users, news feeds overflow with status updates demanding a return to its previous format. 
Timeline, a new Facebook design that displays a user’s entire history in reverse 
chronological order, is generating more backlash than simple grumbling 
comments. Easier accessibility to a user’s history means that privacy on the site 
is becoming increasingly obsolete.

By allowing access to a user’s entire history with a few simple clicks, 
Timeline raises many privacy concerns. A poll of 4,100 Facebook users done 
by security research firm Sophos revealed that over 50 percent of users are 
worried about the new format. Although users can change privacy settings to 
keep profiles solely viewable between friends, settings tend to reset each time 
Facebook alters their layout. This renders once-private information public 
without users realizing it. 

Also troubling is Timeline's ability to publish a user's activity from other 
websites without the user realizing it. People may simply be poking around 
different Yahoo news articles or listening to songs on the music streaming site 
Spotify, not knowing that a digital trail of their online activity is unfolding 
on their news feeds. This is a shameless ploy by third parties to create traffic 
on their sites. Although Facebook is pushing Timeline as a way to preserve 
memories and the chronicle of life, not everyone wants every little detail 
from the time they joined Facebook to be so easily accessible. Now young 
college graduates attempting to enter the professional world need to worry 
not only about the pictures posted from last night’s party, but also the pictures 
from that party freshman year. The implementation of Timeline means that 
people’s entire pasts — including their less-than-proud moments — are up for 
judgment by anyone.

New Format Draws Traffic to Other Sites at User’s Expense  Timeline Prompts a Movement to Other Networks

The Facebook Wall will be gone soon, replaced by Timeline. The new feature has been available to users since December, but some chose not 
to activate it then due to discomfort with its design or worries about privacy. 
The Timeline reveals to us just how much of our lives are broadcasted 
online. But with numerous social networking alternatives rising up to the 
level of Facebook, we need not fear that our days of wall posts, events pages 
and stalking our friends’ photos are over.

New changes include the end of the Facebook Wall, a cover photo, over 
60 new apps which track what users do on other websites and an activity 
log which shows everything the user has done on the website since joining 
it.  Timeline gives users a healthy reality check by showing them just how 
much about themselves they are revealing online — and how they should 
think twice before agreeing to use an app, posting a photo or comment or 
linking an organization's page.

However, if Facebook stops being attractive to users, users can abandon 
it for other social networking websites. In just under a month after its July 
2011 release, Google+ became the fastest social network to reach 25 million 
users. Today, the website already has over 100 million users and continues 
to grow quickly. There is also a trend towards more specialized networks: 
LinkedIn for the networkers, Tumblr for the young crowd, Flickr for the 
artists and Twitter for those who prefer the simple layout. Facebook is 
quickly regressing to become merely a tool to converge all of these other 
networks.

The Timeline will soon be mandatory for everyone on Facebook, but 
that will not stop disgruntled users from leaving the website. Without users, 
Facebook loses its value.

It’s that time of year — the worst time of year: February has rolled around. Everyone is either 
complaining about Valentine’s Day 
or complaining about the people 
who complain about Valentine’s 
Day. And I am caught in the three-
step psychological maneuver that I 
experience every ��h week. First, I 
glance nervously at my upcoming 
exams and papers and start to feel 
nauseated. �en, I rationalize that a 

“seven-to-eight-page paper” won’t 
take too long. Finally, I go back to my 
true love: doing nothing (all the while 
perfectly aware that a research thesis 
won’t write itself and soon — so very 
soon — I will pay).

In other words, welcome to college 
and — judging from the results of 
a 2010 study by Christopher Hsee 
at the University of Chicago — 
welcome to everyday life. In Hsee’s 
study, researchers gave participants 
the choice of dropping o� a package 
at either a location nearby or one 
15 minutes away. Regardless of the 
�nal choice, the participant would 
receive a piece of milk chocolate.  
Unsurprisingly, few people cared 
enough about a piece of chocolate to 
pick the more taxing option. 

�en Hsee really switched things 
up, o�ering milk chocolate for staying 
put and dark chocolate for trekking to 
the farther location — and not only 
did the majority of people take a walk, 
those who did were happier than 
those who stayed put. �e results were 
the same when the chocolate choices 
were switched around, so it’s not just 
the seductive properties of 80-percent 
cacao that lured this sudden spike 
in activity. �e participants simply 
needed to trick themselves into 
creating an incentive — even in 
the form of the false choice of “I 
would rather have dark chocolate” 
— to spring into action. Or, as the 
study’s authors put it, “It’s as if people 
understand that being busy will keep 
them happier, but they need an excuse 
of some kind.” 

Hsee’s study about physical 
idleness is both complemented and 
contradicted by a study on mind-
wandering by Matthew Killingsworth 
and Daniel Gilbert at Harvard 
University. Here, the researchers used 
an iPhone app to prompt users to 
report what they were doing, what 
they were thinking and how they felt.
Apparently, we spend nearly one-half 
our conscious hours thinking about 
something other than what we’re 
doing, and using time-lag analyses, 
Killingsworth and Gilbert concluded 
that a person’s mind-wandering 
is usually the cause of present 
unhappiness. �e speci�c results 
are more confusing though: People 
are unhappiest when they’re on the 
computer, resting or — contrary to 
Hsee’s theories — working. 
         In conclusion: People are 
unhappy when they’re idle, they’re 
unhappy when they’re working and 
they’re unhappy when they’re not 
thinking about what they’re doing, 
which is mostly resting or working. 
       Happy February.

Watch what you put in your search bar, because “Googling” a popular Jersey Shore episode 
could result in ads for tanning salons clogging 

your Web pages and emails. This is because 
Google has recently announced that starting 

March 1, it will be aggregating information 
from users across 60 of its web services including 

Gmail, Google+ and YouTube in order to “better 
serve its users.” This shift, which will literally track 

anything you watch or search, is expected to enhance 
user experience. Although the changes may seem 
positive, the new policy is causing major controversy 
due to its invasion of user privacy. 

This recent decision appears to be contradictory 
to Google’s “don’t be evil” founding philosophy. 
“Don’t be evil” has been Google’s informal motto 
since its founding in 2004, and is a central idea 
of its 10-part business philosophy. In writing, 
Google’s founders described the statement as, 
“We believe strongly that in the long term, 

we will be better served...by a company that 
does good things for the world even if we 

forgo some short term gains.” With this 
noble proposal, Google was able to gain 

the trust of users — but now it seems 
that the company is using private 

information for profit.
In the grand scheme 
of things, Google’s 

actions are 

nothing new in the world of online mega 
sites. The popular social networking site 
Facebook has been tailoring ads to suit 
individual users for years. Since its founding 
in 2004, Facebook set itself apart from other 
sites like Myspace by collecting user information 
to bring a personalized advertisement experience 
to its users. Facebook has made its advertising 
methods transparent and even has a user friendly 
Q&A section detailing the use of information such 
as current city, sex, age, relationship status, jobs, 
school, interests, pages, groups and posts to tailor 
ads. That’s a long list, but Facebook is only using the 
information users provide — not watching every 
click of the mouse. 

What sets Google apart is that the data recorded 
spreads across a range of popular websites, and the 
information chronicled is a lot more detailed. It is 
as personal as the movies you’ve been watching, 
the emails you send, or the things you’ve been 
searching for on the Internet. This comes as 
a shocker users, and has sparked a war of 
words between Google and its long-time 
competitor, Microsoft. Microsoft released 
a “Gmail Man” ad mocking Google’s 
privacy changes, in which a mailman 
walks around reading people’s 
mail. Last week, Microsoft 
also put ads in major 
newspapers that 
slammed 

GOING

Google plans to track user information across 60 of  its Web services 
beginning March 1, a move that will threaten the privacy of  its users.

Privacy Changes Raise Constitutionality Concerns

QUITE FRANKLY By Lior Schenk LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Our primary goal is to defend 

public education by engaging and 
empowering students. We are not 
the out-of-touch idealists featured in 
your article and editorial on Jan. 26.

The renovation of CLICS was 
not announced in response to the 
reclamation last quarter. It was 
announced in an A.S. Council press 
release on September 30, 2011. Last 
year the council killed an $8 student 
fee to save CLICS, but now it wants 
to pass a $165 fee for Division-I 
sports.

Although students have taken 
responsibility for running CLICS, 
we have not set its hours, we did 
not know or plan for it to be open 
and University Centers closes 
the building every night. The 
administration did not “invite 
student input” about re-opening 
CLICS. They re-opened CLICS 
without communication or 
negotiation, and only afterwards did 
they email students.

For a student-run newspaper, 
your editorial board is surprisingly 
cynical about student-run 
organizations. The $370,000 you 
said it would take to run old CLICS 
is irrelevant to whether students 
can run a 100-seat study space in 
the new “Galbraith Hall” (named 
for Chancellor John S. Galbraith 
and his lifelong commitment to 
libraries which have lost 16 percent 
of their budget to UCSD).  Running 
CLICS costs $450,000 annually, but 
renovation will cost $6.7 million to 
run CLICS about 15 years.

We urge the Guardian to be 
a voice for students and support 
student movements in the future. We 
invite students, faculty and staff to 
help us reclaim public education on 

Mondays at 7 p.m. at CLICS or email 
MarchforMarch2012@gmail.com to 
get involved in mobilizing for the 
international day of action on March 
1 and the walkout and reclamation 
of the capitol in Sacramento on 
March 5.

Dear Editor,
Recently, you printed the word 

"gypped" in the opinion piece 
"Buy back your pride by saving on 
textbooks." I understand you are 
trying to be hip using colloquialisms 
to explain how annoying textbook 
prices are but that’s no excuse for 
using racial-ethnic pejorative terms. 
The Romani people (gypsies) might 
not be here in large numbers to get 
offended, but if today you print that 
the bookstore is "gypping us" will 
they be "jewing us" tomorrow too?

Google, and urged users to jump over to Hotmail and Bing. 
Microsoft has managed to harp on Google’s controversy, but 
only to face critques from viewers who find the whole feud 
catty.

More credibly, groups in the UK and members of the 
U.S. Senate have also expressed their disapproval. Rep. Mary 
Bono Mack (R-Calif.) stated that Google officials were not 
"very forthcoming necessarily in what this really means for 
the safety of our families." The Article 29 Working Party, 
an independent European group that deals with issues of 
personal data protection, similarly expressed concerns about 
Google’s policy changes and the effect it would have on the 
protection of personal data across 29 European countries.

Google’s new policies coincidentally came out the same 
week of the Supreme Court case United States v. Jones, 
which serves as precedent for the site’s infringement of 
privacy. The court ruled that it is unconstitutional for the 
FBI to keep GPS tabs on criminals without a warrant since 

this is in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Ironically, in 
the “Information Sharing” section of Google’s new policy, 
it is stated that user information will be shared with third 
parties in an instance of certain governmental requests. 
This is clearly unconstitutional, as users do not present 
their private information to Google with the assumption 
that they are waiving their rights. 

In the days that remain before March 1, users who feel 
violated by this new policy should sign out of their Google 
accounts before using Google, or permanently change their 
settings to limit their personal information. This is the only 
way for users to protect their privacy aside from refraining 
from using Google sites altogether. It may be disturbing 
that websites are tapping into user’s data to make money, 
but frankly people will be “Googling” things regardless of 
where their information is going.

B e l l e  o f  t h e  B a l l
Musician, philanthropist and now a pageant queen — UCSD’s Van Pham 

brings some Triton glory to Miss San Diego. By Stacey Chien • Staff Writer

W arren College junior Van Pham is all too familiar with the glamorous world of pageantry — a far cry from the laid-back campus of UCSD. On Jan. 
22, the economics major was crowned Miss San Diego 2012, 
which came with the added bonus of a $1,000 scholarship.

Before Miss San Diego, Pham competed in Miss Teen 
California and is currently also Miss Arizona Collegiate. But 
she was especially drawn to the Miss San Diego pageant (a 
scholarship pageant under the Miss America Organization) 
as it wasn’t like any of the other pageant systems that she’s 
competed in before; the possibility of winning a scholarship 
to help pay for the ever-increasing cost of tuition and books 
was an extra incentive.

“I was stunned when my name was announced,” Pham 
said.

Though astonished by the results, she had prepared dili-
gently for the pageant. Pham worked to improve her talent 
piece (a piano solo), physical fitness and interview skills — 
making it a habit to tune into the news daily so as to avoid 
drawing a dreadful blank under the glaring spotlight and 
public scrutiny when asked about current events.

Pham may not agree with the superficial light that the 
media often portrays the pageant world in, but appreciates 
what she believes pageants really stand for. 

“For me, pageants teach a girl how to walk and poise with 
grace, to eat healthy and exercise and it shows the impor-
tance of thinking on your feet and being able to articulate 
your opinion,” Pham said. “Because of the interview skills 

I’ve learned through the Miss America Organization, I have 
nailed every job interview I have ever applied for, including 
an internship at a social media and PR agency and I know 
this skill will come in handy when I apply for graduate 
schools. Lastly, it gives me a chance to perform and play 
piano onstage.”

Pham managed to impress the judges with her piano per-
formance — a component that accounted for a substantial 
chunk (35 percent) of the overall score. She has been playing 
the piano since she was five (she also plays the guitar and 
flute), and music has always been a big part of her life. 

“Growing up, my parents showed me the importance of 
music and how it can be a positive force,” Pham said. “After 
high school, I worked at a children’s music studio helping to 
teach piano and guitar lessons. It is such a rewarding experi-
ence to be able to share my passion for music with others; 
not only did I get to work with kids, but I was surrounded by 
something I love every day.”

The pageant queen is now pursuing a minor in music and 
will also be able to continue to work with kids through her 
childcare platform, Little Fingers, Helping Hands — a cause 
that she hopes to promote during her reigning year. 

“Back in my hometown [in Marin County], I created a 
daycare center at the local homeless shelter, where a group 
of volunteers and I took care of the children biweekly,” Pham 
said. “The program was a great success and allowed parents 
to have time away from their kids in order to look for jobs 
and proper housing.”

Pham, now serving as San Diego’s official hostess (she has 
and will be attending many appearances and events through-
out the year on behalf of charities and sponsors), even has 
hopes of starting a childcare program in San Diego and said 
that her goal is to get the program up and running by this 
summer.

She will be competing in the Miss America Collegiate 
national pageant in March but said she is most exited about 
competing in the Miss California pageant in June, the official 
preliminary to Miss America. As a Miss California hopeful, 
she is currently preparing a new piece on the piano and is 
also working closely with the Miss San Diego pageant com-
mittee to further improve her interview skills and advance 
her platform.

 “I can’t wait to compete at Miss California,” Pham said. 
“I am excited to have this opportunity of a lifetime to attend 
the state competition in Fresno with all the other inspiring 
titleholders.” 

But being sure not to get too caught up in all the excite-
ment, Pham has kept her sights on her educational goals; 
she hopes to attend graduate school to obtain an MBA after 
graduating next spring. 

In the meantime, she is enjoying her time at UCSD.
“It’s impossible to dislike a school located in San Diego; 

not only is our campus beautiful, it’s a short distance from 
the beach,” Pham said.

INFOCUS ELLIE’S GARDEN

L ike most college students, Nicole Wyrick became home-sick for the comforts that 
college life could never provide.  
       For her, the missing piece to life at 
Roosevelt College was freshly-picked 
food.

“I really enjoy cooking,” Wyrick 
said. “At home I have a garden so I can 
go outside and get what I need, and I 
missed that convenience when I came 
to college.”

With that in mind, Wyrick and 
several other ERC students launched 
Ellie’s Garden, a new community gar-
den on the Roosevelt College campus.

Ellie’s Garden, located between 
Africa and Asia Halls, will provide 
free access for students to pick their 
choice of the herbs, flowers and fruits 
that EGERC club members plan to 
plant and harvest this quarter. 

But the group has a greater mis-
sion than simply to spice up the diet 
of ERC students.

“We wanted to have a way to 
understand where our food comes 
from, and learn about creating a sus-
tainable lifestyle,” EGERC treasurer 
Tiffany Lin said. “We want to show 
students that you don’t need to resort 
to artificial foods and flavors in order 
to live and eat well.”

According to Wyrick, EGERC vice 
chair, Ellie’s Garden was inspired, in 
part, by Earl’s Community Garden in 
Warren College, an on-campus site 
where students can own individual 
plots to foster plants of their choice.

But the founders of EGERC want-
ed to create a garden that would 
be accessible for all students, even 
to those who do not participate in 
building the garden and maintaining 
its plants.

“The garden is a free access gar-
den, so any student can come and 
take what they need to create a meal 
or season something,” said Lin.

What’s more, Wyrick said that 
having the garden completely open 
and accessible will help to foster a 
sense of community across ERC.

“Our goal is to incorporate every 
aspect of the ERC community, to 
connect freshmen to second and 
third years and the International 
House community,” Wyrick said. 
“Community building was a big part 
of our inspiration.”

Students laid out plots for the gar-
den earlier this month. So far, EGERC 
club members and ERC students have 
planted mint and several fruit trees, 
including guava, fig and lemon. 

By the end of the quarter, they 
plan to finish with herbs and move 
on to more fruits and vegetables, 
Wyrick said.

EGERC board members say that 
the plants will be ready to harvest 
within a few weeks. They plan to 
organize a harvest feast for students 
in the spring. 

Students interested in contribut-
ing to the project can attend garden-
ing sessions every Monday at 3 p.m. 
and Thursdays at 2 p.m.

“We’re doing a lot of our own 
research now on plants and sustain-
able growing,” Wyrick said. “We wel-
come anyone who wants to learn 
about gardening.”

“When you have a shot blocker like that, you 
just got to keep going after him,” McCann said. 
“You just keep taking it to him.”

Despite their height disadvantage at the post-
position, the Tritons kept attacking in the paint, 
out-rebounding the Golden Eagles by four while 
also shooting four percent better from the floor. 
Leading the assault along with McCann was 
junior guard Tyler McGrath, whose streaky play 
from the perimeter has earned him the name 
“The Light Switch.” 

But tonight, McGrath was totally on, shooting 
six of seven from the floor and draining three 
of three from behind the arc.  Down the stretch, 
the Tritons had trouble breaking the press after 
McCann was taken out at 15:37 for a quick 
breather. 

With McCann out, Cal State Los Angeles 
jumped on the Tritons, out-rebounding UCSD to 
get four put-backs on one possession. 

The following Triton offensive attempt was 

thwarted as the Golden Eagles soared to block 
three Triton shots in a row. The CSU Los Angeles 
full-court press resulted in no less than five 
turnovers in the four minutes McCann was out.

Only “McCannCan” break the Los Angeles 
press, and so Carlson put McCann back on the 
court. The guard immediately ripped through 
the press to set up a McGrath three-pointer —
swinging the momentum back in the Tritons’ 
favor. Up 57-52, the Tritons let the Eagles back 
in the game with an easy dunk and two clutch 
free throws by senior Eagle forward Leland Jones. 
Thankfully, the Eagles failed to capitalize on the 
last shot as the Tritons took the game 57-56.

On Saturday, the Tritons faced Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, who is currently tied for first 
place in the CCAA and had just lost the night 
before to Cal State San Bernardino. 

In the game, the Triton defense held the 
usually explosive Toro offense to just 46 points. 
UCSD took the win to the tune of 48-46. Again 
the Tritons saw a hard-fought game that came 

down to the wire. McCullough had a career 
high of 16 points, five rebounds and two assists. 
He scored 14 of his 16 points in the first half 
before the Toros locked down their defense and 
marginalized the deficit in the last two minutes 
of play. Coming down the stretch, McCullough 
put in his last two points from the free-throw line 
to give the Tritons a 45-34 lead. The Toros woke 
up and scored twelve points in just two minutes 
after a scoring drought that lasted most of second 
half. Dominguez used a full court press much 
like LA had the night before to cause the Tritons 
problems on defense. They went on a 10-1 streak 
to make the game 46-44. 

McCann had the chance to put the game in 
the basket, but missed one of two free throws, 
which were followed by a Toro layup to make it 
a one-point game at 47-46, with only 14 seconds 
left to play.  Getting the ball in to Hatch, the 
Toros fouled the lowest percentage free-throw 
shooter on the Triton starting lineup, who sank 
one of two to push the lead to two.

Instead of going for overtime, the Dominguez 
Hills went for the win. Toro guard Everett Brown 
shot a three, only to have it ricochet off backcourt 
as the horn signaled the end of the game. 
Unfortunately, McGrath suffered a concussion 
early in the bout and had to leave the court 
bleeding. The injury is the second concussion of 
the year for the Tritons, who are still down a man 
in junior guard Ryan Peters — who was injured 
earlier in the season against Cal State Monterey 
Bay. Both players are expected to make full 
recoveries and return to the court in a few weeks.

The dual wins over the weekend have given 
strength to an otherwise defeated Triton team, 
which is now within three games of making the 
CCAA tournament with six games remaining in 
the regular season. 

The Tritons play Chico this Friday, Feb. 10 at 
7:30 p.m. at RIMAC.

with our defense and the shots started coming 
in the second half,” Elliot said.

In the second half, the Tritons adjusted 
their game by attacking inside, instead of 
relying on their perimeter play. Compared 
to the 22 three-point attempts in the first 
half, UCSD chanced just six in the second 
half, sinking two buckets. At the same time, 
the Tritons were more prudent with their 
possessions, putting away 17 of their 27 field 
goal attempts for an impressive 63.0 percent 
from the field.

Outscoring the Golden Eagles 35-49 in 
the second half, strong play from Dautremont 
made a huge impact on the match down the 
stretch.

Dautremont — who had a difficult time 
matching up against the heavier Ramon and 
went without a bucket in the first half — 
finished the game with 12 points. The Triton 
forward came out aggressive in the paint, 
attacking Ramon to get to the free-throw line 

on three occasions, while also nabbing five 
rebounds and two crucial steals.

From there, the Tritons ran away with the 
game, with senior forward Lauren Freidenberg 
finishing with a double-double, 17 points 
on 10 rebounds. Junior guard Emily Osga 
recorded eight points to go along with eight 
rebounds and a team leading five assists.

Senior guard Chelsea Carlisle also 
contributed 16 points.

When asked about how the Tritons 
manufactured a 15-point lead coming out of 
the half up by just one, Carlisle said UCSD was 
just determined to get the win.

“It’s always what we do,” Carlisle said. 
“That’s just what this team’s about. We shot 
terribly, we’re never going to shoot like this 
again, but we fought and we knew that we’re 
resilient and we knew that we were going to 
win.”

On Saturday, the Tritons took another 
15-point win, beating Cal State Dominguez 
Hills 77-52.

Unlike the day before, the Tritons had no 
problem taking the lead. In the first half, off of 
14-29 shooting, the Tritons ended the first half 
with a 21-point lead. 

The 3-20 Toros never put up much of 
a resistance, as all of UCSD’s bench saw 
significant minutes.

Osga led UCSD with 19 points, while Feder 
went 4-for-4 from behind the arc to chip in 14 
points.

With six games still remaining in CCAA 
play, the Tritons are the only team in the 
conference to have secured a post-season 
conference berth.

UCSD will continue its homestead this 
weekend. On Friday, Feb. 10, the Tritons will 
face off against middle of the pack Chico 
State and on Saturday, Feb. 11, UCSD will 
host bottom of the conference Cal State 
Stanislaus.

Taking two wins at home this weekend, the No. 1 UCSD Women’s Basketball team protects its top ranking by remaining undefeated in the 2012 season. 
On Friday, Feb. 3, the Tritons faced Cal State Los Angeles 

— the second ranked CCAA conference squad. With 2,296 
people in attendance, UCSD sought its 21st season win at 
Spirit Night.

The 13-5 Golden Eagles shot out to an early lead as 
6’0” senior forward Lacy Ramon overpowered the Tritons’ 
sophomore forward Erin Dautremont to score eight of Cal 
State Los Angeles’ first 10 points. 

Trailing 10-5 with Triton senior shooting guard Daisy 
Feder 1-for-5 in just the first five minutes of play, UCSD 
head coach Charity Elliott called for the timeout, replacing 
Feder with freshman shooting guard Natalie Luzar. The 
change proved crucial as Luzar drew a charge from Ramon 
in the next possession and then hit a three-pointer to get the 
Triton offense going. 

Down 24-19 with five minutes remaining, the game had 
yet to fall into tempo. The well-conditioned Tritons executed 
their typical run-and-gun offense while the Golden Eagles 
kept pace the entire half by cutting deep into their bench, 
fielding 12 players out of their 14-man roster.

With the first period coming to a close, Elliott put her 
starting line-up back on the court. UCSD went on a 7-2 run, 
with Feder sinking a three-pointer to put the Tritons up 
before the half.

“That first half was about as poor as we could play and 
shoot the ball offensively, and I’m just so proud that we stuck

Coming off a three-game losing streak, the Triton Men’s Basketball team came away with two wins over the weekend — the first weekend double the team has 
captured this season.

The Tritons came in to Friday night’s game fired up. The huge 
student turnout for Spirit Night added fuel to the team’s fire, 
especially because the Tritons — ranked second-to-last in the 
conference — were the obvious underdogs against second-ranked 
Cal State Los Angeles. “The crowd really played a huge role in 
[making] a difference for us tonight,” sophomore guard James 
McCann said. 

The Tritons took the tip and the first two points when their 
motion offense opened a lane for McCann to drive in for a 
teardrop over the Golden Eagles’ Carl Hoffman, a 6’9” junior that 
tips the scales at nearly 280 pounds.  Hoffman, who outweighs 
Triton center Christian Hatch by 30 pounds, largely contained 
the Triton points-per-game leader, who ended the night with just 
eight points and seven rebounds. 

The Eagles proved more athletic than the Tritons, as they 
successfully utilized a full-court press to pull out a 7-4 lead in the 
first few minutes. But UCSD Head Coach Chris Carlson cut deep 
into his bench to minimize fatigue. The quick changes worked, as 
McCann was able to break the Los Angeles press time and again 
off the dribble. 

Cal State Los Angeles countered by removing its big man, 
Hoffman, in favor of junior center Jordan Richard. Richard went 
on to have a field day, blocking shots in the paint and pinning 
them high off the glass to finish with eight blocks, a conservative 
count.

The No. 10 UCSD Men’s Tennis team started its season last Saturday, defeating Hope International University 
and the University of Redlands. 

The Tritons had a few close sets against 
Hope International in the morning but overall 
they dominated the Royals, beating them 
9-0. Senior Jason Wall led singles, winning in 
straight sets of 6-0 and 6-0 while sophomore 
Max Jiganti won 6-2 and 6-1 and junior Austin 
West won 6-1 and 6-2. Seniors Chapman Chan 
and Sam Ling, and junior Junya Yoshida also 
won their respective matches 7-5, 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 
and 6-4, 6-3. The doubles team of Wall and 
freshman Kona Luu won 8-0, while Ling and 
Yoshida won 8-1, and West and sophomore 
Devin Sousa won 8-5.

Later that evening Tritons defeated 
Redlands 8-1. Yoshida had an intense singles 
match, losing the first set 4-6 and coming back 
to win the second set 6-1. Yoshida won the 
tiebreaker 15-13. 

Ling also had a close match, winning 7-6, 

7-5. West, Jiganti and Luu won their singles 
matches 6-4, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 and 6-2, 6-0. 

Chapman was visibly upset during his 
singles match, losing the tiebreaker — 6-7, 6-2, 
7-10. 

The doubles teams took hard-fought wins. 
Sousa and West played the longest match, 
finally winning 9-8. By the time they finished 
their match, every player from each team was 
watching and cheering for their respective 
sides. 

“I think they were really competitive,” Sousa 
said. “Me and [West] held high — that helped 
us to put it out in the end.”

The doubles teams of Luu and Wall, and 
Chan and Jiganti also won their matches, 9-8, 
8-6.

The UCSD Men’s Tennis team returns to 
the court against Concordia Irvine Feb. 7 at 2 
p.m.

The Concordia Eagles are currently ranked 
No. 11 nationally in the NAIA Coaches’ 
Preseason Poll.
