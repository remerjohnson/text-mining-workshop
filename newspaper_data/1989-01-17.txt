Assorted 
Vinyl May 
Be Closed 
By LAURA PROCTOR 
Sia/f Writer 
The A.S. Council will vote on 

the proposal to discontinue the 
Assorted Vinyl enterprise at 
tomorrow night's council meet-
ing. The record store had pre-
viously been scheduled to move 
to the new Price Center. 

The council voted last week to 
postpone the measure, to give the 
store's managers a chance to 
gather information and prepare 
to appeal the proposal. 

Although it has been losing 
money for several years, general 
manager Sharon Lai said the 
record store, located at the Stu-
dent Center, fills a definite stu-
dent need. She blames the store's 
poor financial history on "a lot of 
poor decisions [and] judgment" 
on the .part of the past manage-
ment. 

Despite the projected cost of 
$54,000 to move into the Price 
Center and the rent increase of 
over 100 percent to continue 
operating there, Lai said that 
Assorted Vi.nyl would eventually 
benefit from the new location. 

"It's possible to turn the place 
around as long as we move to the 
Price Center," she said "Here we 
have no chance." 

Lai dismissed the possibility of 
staying at the Student Center, cal-
ling the current location "a hole in 
the wall" and "a closet." She 
anticipates that business would 
improve in a location with more 
customer traffic, which could 
result in an increase in "impulse 
sales. " 

If Assorted Vinyl moves to the 
Price Center it would be located 
between the Copy Center and the 
new pub. There will also be A TM 
machines nearby, to facilitate

the Student Center, "is nothing." 

over $2,000. The losses have 
increased each year, with a deficit 
last year of $4,493. 

For this year, the deficit after 
only one quarter was $4,1/2 , 
almost equal to the losses for all 
three quarters last year. Lai says 
these figures are misleading, since

UC Fee Increase Foreseen 

State Budget Causing 
Problems For UCs 

By JILL COLLEY 
Staff Wriler 

The proposed four percent state 
budget increase for the University 
of California announced Jan. 10 
by Governor George Deukmei-
jiarr, in conjunction with a 10 
percent increase in student fees , 
has presented a fi cal challenge to 
UC administrator . The Univer-
sity had hoped for more funds 
through a 10 percent budget 
increase for the 1989-90 academic 
year. 

Deukmejian's proposal pro-
vides a $2.053 billion for the Uni-
versity which, in a proposal by the 
Board of Regents in November, 
had requested a 10 percent state 
funding increase it considered 
necessary to maintain exi ting 
levels of operation and to provide 
for enrollment growth. 

David P. Gardner, president of 
the Board of Regents, said that 
under the governor's proposal, 
the University will still be able to 
ustain operation , but "only by 

arranging a patchwork of one-
time, extraordinary budgetary 
actions designed to get us through 
the next year." 

Gardner further commented 
that the recently adopted Propo-
sition 98 "will put the University's 
financial condition at risk and 
will make its projected enrollment 
growth unattainable." 

Under Prop. 98, an initiative 
constitutional amendment and 
statute approved in last Novem-
ber's election, approximately 40 

percent of the state's general funds 
will automatically be allocated to 
the public school system (kinder-
garten through 12th grades) as 
well as community colleges. 

The remaining funds are then 
to be divided up among other 
state supported agencies. This 
includes the UC system, the Cali-
fornia State University system, 
and numerous other agencies such 
as highway maintenance, prison 
funding, and welfare. 

Another legislative factor that 
may affect UC enrollment growth 
is the Gann Limit, an initiative 
that controls and limits allocation 
of funds to state funded agencies. 

"These two fiscal constraints 
will continue to jeopardize [the] 
UC's ability to educate all UC-
eligible California students who 
wish to attend [the University]," 
Gardner said. 

The governor's 1989 budget 
makes it clear that we will have to 
work toward a long term solution 
to this funding problem in order 
to maintain our quality in the face 
of increased student demand," 
he added. 

Deukmejian has also proposed 
a 10 percent increase' in student 
fees and an out-of-state tuition 
increase of 17 percent. 

Fee increases, according to Vice 
President of the University of 
California Student Association 
(UCSA) Norman Tien, are usu-
ally anticipated each year due to 
inflation. 

Deukmejian has proposed fund-
ing for about half of the UC

Assorted Vinyl has been open 
for appoximately eight years, said 
A.S. Advisor Randy Woodard, 
but only made a profit for 
approximately the first two of

prise's financial situation has only 
worsened. In the school year of 
1985-86, it had a net deficit just 

New UCSD Constitution Possible 
Dimmesdale Still Pushing Constitutional Convention 

By LAURA PROCTOR 
Sla!! Wriler 

Noted Feminist Speaks Despite his defeat in la t week' A.S. meeting, 
President Maynard Dimme dale intend to go ahead 
with his proposal for a constitutional convention. 

Students, according to Dimmesdale, coul~ ' 'S~ill 
play an active role in the revising process and Would 
have a voice in restructuring the A.S. government. 

Such re tructuring might include changes in the 
number and type of representative who hold vot-
ing power in the council, Dimme dale said.

FEATURES 

Since the Wednesday meeting, Dimmesdale has 
been circulating petition among the tudent body, 
hoping to obtain enough signature to override the 
council's opposition to the proposal. Dimmesdale 
needs the signatures of 15 percent of the tudent 
body in order to proceed with the convention. 

A constitutional convention would be the forum 
for revi ion of the current A.S. Constitution and 
would be open to attendance and active participa-
tion by any interested students. 

Dimmesdale says this would be preferable to hav-
ing the A.S. Council revise the constitution, because 
all interested students could have an equal voice in 
the shaping of the document. He hope a new consti-
tution will increase student repre entation in the 
council. 

In accordance with current con titutional provi-
sions, the council's pre ident, in conjunction with a 
con titutional committee, would pre ide over the 
propo ed convention. 

La t week, 14 of the councilmembers voted' 
against the measure, and only three voted in favor of 
it. Two abstained . 

Of those in favor of the resolution, two were 
commissioner: Programming Commis ioner Jona-
than Judaken and Public Relations Commissioner 
Tom Rhee. 

Molly McKay, Revelle' freshperson enator, was 
the only senator upporting the mea ure. 

Currently, the constitution allows only one revi-
sion per quarter. If the council revises the constitu-
tion to exclude that stipulation, it could then imple-
ment as many revisions as it feels are necessary. 

Revision of the con titution requires that the 
council submit the amended document to the stu-
dent body for approval through an election. Stu-
dent could then either adopt the new constitution 
or opt to maintain the current one. In the event that 
everal con titutional plan are propo ed, the student

Confusion in UCSF Dorms-
Robbed Over Winter Break 

SAN FRANCISCO - Residents of EI East in 
Aberdeen-Ivernes Residence Hall at UCSF were 
urpri ed to return from Winter Break to discover 

that 21 rooms in the hall had been broken into. 
The robber(s) entered through an exterior window 

which they pried open. 
Andy Plumley, Resident Director, said, " ... from 

that room they got in the hall and pried off ... door-
knobs." All the rooms were discovered propped open 
except Room 115. 

Plumley added that , " ... everything was locked," 
over Winter Break, and damage was Limited to the 
doorknobs. 'There'l be a whole new locking system 
so the residents get new keys ... And we're also 
looking into a new security system for when we are 
shut down like this," Plumley said. 

The crime had had one unexplainable twist that 
campus officials as well as the police are still puzzling 
over. " When we looked at the rooms and the police 
were here .. . things looked like they were moved from 
one room to the next. Why, I don't know," Plumley 
said. -Tina Damikolas, The Highlander

neaJcct since "women have supprcsacd their natures to the ex.tent

Ac:cordina to Johnson, it is the fi,htinl or "reIistina" that

opposition. 

"If you don' lubscribe to patriarchal institutions, then you 
bave to think of alternative solutions. " 

Johnson ended ber lcc:ture by outlining the rules she feels will 
advance the ideali of feminism. 

Her rules were al foUows: 
• "Never speak ~ other women. If you don' like what [a 

woman] il doiq, JO up .... cen herabout it. Don' tell everybody 
else. We don' need to do patriarchy's work for it.

Since then, she has written two books and is working on a

In J 982, she fasted for 37 days in Springfield, lllinois for

request for inflation and fixed 
costs. This, however, is still $30 
million below the UC budget 
proposal. 

"Even with the student fee 
increase, the University is still not 
getting an inflationary adjustme nt 
for this budget ," Tien said . 

On Jan. 10 the UCSA de-
nounced Deukmejian's proposed 
student fee increase as "a serious 
departure from the state's student 
fee policy," according to UCSA 
President Tracey Woodruff. 

T he state' student fee policy, 
according to information released 
by the UCSA. provides that stu-
dent fees at the University of Cali-
fornia and the California State 
University a re to be set according 
to a methodology based on pre-
vious budget increases. For 1989-
90, the fee-setting formula called 
for a three percent increase in UC 
fees. 

According to Gardner, the 
governor's proposa l means that 
the Universi ty will have to engage 
in cost saving efforts, including 
budget reallocations to be deter-
mined by the individual UC cam-
puses. 

The fee increase was allowed 
under the provisions of the Long 
Term Student Fee Policy adopted 
in 1985. 

The policy allows a fee increase 
of up to 10 percent, but only due 
to an "unforseen circumstance." 
According to Tien , Prop. 98 was 

considered such a circu mstance 
under the policy. 

Non-California residents in 
particular will feel the effects of 
the fee increase. Tuition fees have 
gone up by 15 percent in t he last 
year. 

The 17 percent 1989-90 increa e 
means that within two years out-
of-state fees have risen by 32 
percent. 

Foreign students will be signif-
ica ntly affected by the increase as 
well , because unlike out-of-state 
American students, they are 
unable to declare California 
residency within the first year of 
residence, according to Reinhart 
Lutz, external pre ident of the 
Graduate Student Association. 

This means that the 32 percent 
fee increase over the last two years 
will affect most foreign students 
for the duration of their studies at 
the University. 

Lutz fears that this "huge 
financial burden will affect the 
quality of education for all UC 
student s," since many foreign 
students. especially at the gradu-
ate level , may not be able to 
afford the increase. Lutz feels that 
this might have an impact on the 
availability and quality of teach-
ing assistants and decrease di ve r-
sity among the student body. 

The Regents will discuss the 
new budget and fee increase 
proposals at a Santa Barbara 
meeting on Jan. 20.

Luis Ramirez, the Commis-

rather than a radical, co nvention-
style overhaul. 

"I think a lot of things in the

because of the way the school's

the council could effectively ac-

that all interested students would

Honor Through Action 
The holiday i over and we are back into our daily routine . 

Martin Luther Kin gJr. 's birthday has come and gone. He would 
have been 60. 

Parades were held and televi ion specials were aired and the 
late Dr. King received a good deal of media coverage. A lot of 
people went to those parades and watched those pecials and 
read the newspaper articles about the man , his dream, and his 
death. But how many of these people are thinking about Dr. 
King today? And more importantly, how many of these people 
are doing anything to further his cause? 

We all have a tendency believe that Ihinkingabout civil rights 
and equality i the arne thing as promoting civil rights and 
equality. 

Rosa Park surely thoughl about racism and discrimination 
prior to the bus boycott of 1955, but it wasn't until she refused to 
give her city bus seat up to a white per on that the civil right 
movement began to make headway. 

UC 0 is a long way from the Montgomery. Alabama of 
1955. II would be a mistake, however. to think that this Univer-
si ty, nestled in the affluent community of La Jolla, is free of 
racial discrimination . Take a look around. How many black 
students do you see? How manydo you know? How many black 
professors and administrators have you ever come in contact 
with? 

It is true that racially discriminatory laws have been erased 
(rom the na tion's law books, but in a country where freedom still 
carries a price tag, discriminatory laws aren't the problem any 
more. Economic inequality, subtle and not-so-subtle racial bigot-
ry, and public apathy are the obstacles people of color face 
today. 

Why aren't there jTIore black students attending this college? 
Is it because they don't want to? Or is it because fees and 
ad mission standards keep rising and wages , financial aid , and 
the quality of elementary and high school education keep 
dropping? 

It took 15 years for the U.S. government to proclaim Martin 
Luther King J r. 's birthday a national holiday. It took 15 years 
for the American publ ic to finally twist the legislature's arm into 
doing so. How many more years will it take for us to really honor 
Dr. King by realizing his dream? H ow many years will it take 
before we act?

A License 
To Hunt 
Editor: 

One issue which has not been 
discussed lately in the Guardian 
i ' the on-campus parking si tua-
tion. especia lly at the Fifth College 
Residence Hall. Pepper anyon. 
and Matthews Apartments. 

These three housing complexes 
arc provided with (\\,0 very sma ll 
parking lots which ob\ iously are 
not equipped to handle the high 
vo lume of automobiles owned by 
(he residents . 

According 10 the Fifth College 
residence office, these same lots 
have a ridicu lous ratio of three 
students to each parking space ! 
Parking is adequate on the week-
ends . However. if a resident 
cannot find a space in either park-
ing lot by Sunday night , which 
frequently occurs, the residen t is 
forced to park in a remote lot 

Constitution 
Overhaul 
Dear Editor : 

It is with great hesitation that I 
write an opinion to the Guardian. 
As a current member of the A.S. 
Council. I am reluctant 10 bring 
personal conflicts to the National 
Enquirer audience of the Opinio n 
section . As an undergraduate stu-
dent of UCSD, however, I feel an 
item of greatest importance should 
be addres ed. 

On Wednesday night, yo ur A.S. 
Council voted down a resolution 
allowing for significa nt changes 
in the current way the student 
government is being run. Your 
representatives claimed it was not 
what "the students" wa nted . They 
claimed it Was too r isky to a llow 
the Constitution to be completely 
rewritten by any interested tu-

ing lots are a lway filled to 
ca pacity. and the unfortunate 
ex tra cars consta ntly search. wait. 
and prepare to dart into a space 
which has become vacant. 

Consequently, the lucky people 
who have a spot leave their auto 
in the parking space unless it i 
absolutely necessary to drive ome-
where else. for fear oflosing it. As 
a re ult, these victims are some-

wh!l~ trapped on campus. 
These students. as any on-

campus resident . sho uld not ha ve 
to deal with this pred icament. I 
find it ironic that we spend $150 
for a penn it which does not guaran-
tee a reasonable parking space. I 
am su re I am not the only person 
who feels this way. since my room-
mates are also disgusted with this 
si tuation. 

More parki ng must be made 
availa ble. While UCSDcontinues 
to develop and expand. it a ppears 
that parking seems to have been 
left out of the agenda .

dents . They also questioned the 
intentions of Maynard Dimme -
dale. A.S. President , in calling fo r 
this convention .. 

It is unfortunate that such a 
perspnal battle has resulted in 
what I would consider a com plete 
disregard for the students' best 
inte rest. It is. however, fortunate 
that the last revisers of the Consti-
tution foresaw this pos ibilityand 
provided another method for you, 
the rea l students, to make a di f-
ference: 

Thi alternative is to sign a peti-
tion calling for a constitutional 
convention. Maynard Dimmes-
dale will undoubltedly write an 
appeal as well, explai ning the 
necessity for this action. 

I urge you to sign the petition 
and relate the importance of a 
convention to your respective A.S. 
representative. Copies of the peti-
tio n will be available from 

Concerts in the Main Gym Again? Take a Stand 
EDITOR 

IN 
A 

Box 

Edilor in a Box is wrilten bl' 
a different Guardian editdr 
every Monday. 

By LARRY WEI NTRA UB 
Music Editor 

The purpose of the Editor's 
Box is traditionally to allow the 
Guardian editor to expose a 
more personal insight into their 
feelings and views. What I'm 
about to discuss , however, will 
not only benefit me. but you, 
the students as well. My object 
here is to let you know why 
UCSD has so few concerts. and 
what can be done about it. 

Have you ever wondered why 
San Diego State hosts all the 
best rock shows, wh y 
Humphrey's features the top 
jazzacts,and why the Bacchanal 
spotlights the latest-breaking 
taJent? If you do, then you have 
a IDt in common with a majority 
of UCSD's student popUlation . 

If you think it's becau e of 
money, I'm pleased to inform 
you that is not the case. As a 
matter of fact, each year a 
significant percentage of student 
registration fees are designated 
for the very purpose of provid-
ing this form of entertainment. 
If lack of student interest is 
your guess, once again that's 
not the case. According to 
administrative studies, the lU-
dents of UCSD have been 
demanding better shows for 
years. Finally, if you think that 
the people responsible for put-
tingon these events don't really 
care, then you're not even close . 
The University Events office 
works specifically for the pur-
pose of supplying the e concerts. 

The major factor preventing 
UCS D from competing with 
other ventures is our lack of 
facilities. Sure, we have our 
Gym; it stands 2,000 people 
fairly uncomfortably, and re-
quires cancelling physical 
education classes for an entire 
day to produce a three-hour 

~how. As for sound quality , 
well , that goes unsaid . 

Yes, the Triton PUb. Mande-
ville Auditorium, and the forth-
coming University Center Ball-
room provide adequate space 

for rising artists; however, their 
availability is equally rare and 
requires enormous production 
costs. 

In essence, what this U ni-
versity needs is a designated 
concert facility: a theatre-style 
arena that can accommodate at 
least one third of the student 
population (which will soon 
break 20,OOO), and is specifically 
and acoustically designed for 
musica l and theatrical perfor-
mances. There are even sites that 
were chosen several years ago 
when this issue was first consi-
dered. 

Giving an exa mple of what 
the hall should look lik e is 
difficult because few people will 
be ab le to relate to the places I 
have in mind . It should be 
noted , however, that there is no 
curre nt location in Sa n Diego 
like this suggested one. and 
there are no plan to build o ne . 
Neither the proposed UCSD or 
SDS U recreation facilities will 
meet these needs. Both will 
undoubtedly amount to larger 
cale versions of our beloved 

Main Gym. 
By now you're probably think-

ing that this is a great idea . but 
where will the money come 
from and what impact can yo u. 

the student , have. Addressi ng 
the firs t point. 111 be honest, the 
money may have to come 
partially from Registra tion fees, 
ini tially. However, unlike the 
new University Center, a concert 
ve nue could easily generate 
hundreds of thousands of dol-
la rs each year towards upkeep 
a nd ex pa nsion. I must stress 
though, right now money is not 
the problem, motivation is. 

The administration has to be 
told directly, not from surveys 
and annual reports, that we the 
students are tired of dealing 
with the age restrictions and 
distance problems with going 
off-campus for shows. College 
music is geared towards college 
students , and, as o ne of the 
nation's leading universities, 
UCS D should be showcasing 
thi s tale nt for its student s. 
UCSD prides itself in its interest 
in the arts, yet we have on ly 
limi ted way~ of displaying it. 

All I can ask is that you, the 
student , take a stand. Write 
letters to the Guardian, to the 

hancellor a nd Vice Chancellor. 
, tart talking to administrators 
and school ofriciab. The only 
way thi proposed fa ility will 
ever become a reality i~ if you 
demand It! 

Paranoia, 
Not Sexism 
Editor: 

Upon reading a letter entitled 
"Campus M inds S tag na te," 
[Guardiall. Jan . 9] I realized that 
there is. a much more serious 
pro blem on campus today than 
sexism and racism - para noia. 

I n a ll fun. a nyer was distributed 
for a party. I did not a ttend the 
party, nor did I eve n see the fl yer, 
but I do know tha t this fl ye r was 
distributed for the ole purpose of 
publicizing the party. not to 
degrade the female race or "broad-
en the ge nder ga p"as Ms. Young 
feared. 

Her se nsa tionalized, paranoid 
view of this party flyer (fo r God's 
sake) makes me wonder what this 
kind of over-analyzing co uld do 
to a pe rson, or a society. If a 
skeleton appears on an album

GPA Policy 
Dangerous 
Editor: 

Students beware. The UCSD 
Committee on Educational Policy 
(CEP) has allowed the CSE, ECE, 
and AMES departments to create 
a loophole in student G PAs which 
may set the standard for all 
impacted majors, if we do not 
oppose it now. 

In July, 1985 the EECS depart-
ment co ncluded that during their 
sc reening process, they would 
average both grades if students 
repeated a class. 

That sameyearthe UCSD CEP 
decided that this method was 
appropriate, even though it was 
apparently in vio lation of regula-
tion 780(c)(4). This regulation 
states: 

In compuling Ihe grade point 
average of an undergraduate who 
repeats courses in which he 
received a D or F. onlv rhe mosr 
recently earned grades' and grade 
puints shall be usedfor theflrsI16 
unirs repeared. In rhe case of 
further repetilions. the grade point 
average shall be based on all 
grades assigned and lotal units 
allempted. 

In June, 1988 the University 
(sys temwide) CEP discussed this 
legal question a nd concluded that 
this method directly conflicted 
with regulation 780(e)(4). In a 
letter sent to the hairperson of 
the San Diego Di vision of the 
Academic Senate, the systemwide 
committee Chairperson stated: 

... It is the view of Ihis commit-
lee thaI il is clear Ihar the regula-
tioll (780(cX4)) addresses compwa-

flyers displaying large-breasted 
females be boycotted or should 
the police be immediately sum-

Despite the fact that I am a 
freshman, I feel that I already 
know enough a bout party flyers 
to know that they are not created 
for the purpose of making women 
look like the "lesser sex," but for 
simply promoting a social event , 
and they should not be taken for 
too much else.

OPINION Tuesday. January 17. 1989 5 

Q and A: What 'do you think of the size of your 
upper-division classes? 

I expected the classes to 
be considerably smaller than 
my general ed. courses, but 
the number of students is 
still ridiculously large. It s 
not fair because we are not 
gelling enough personalized 
attention from the instruc-
tors. 

Emily Fong 
Junior, Revelle 

Econ 

I think some of them are 
absolutely 100 large. I hate 
having to COme in and sit 
down on the floor, in the 
hallway, or in the back of 
the room. They should try 
to do something about it -
like divide the classes in 
two.

I think the size of the 
classes are ridiculous. I mean 
you have to sit on LheJ7oor.

give a little more personal-
ized attention 10 the stu-
dents. The least they should 
do is give us seats.

UCSD Crime Prevention. Day Gives Students Safety Info

do or where to turn for help. I 
want them to see how they can

Activitie on the Plaza incl uded 
engraving services offered by 
Community Service Officer and 
the sale of bicycle and auto safety 
devices by the Bike Coop. 

Other efforts to increase stu-
dent awareness included a sur-
prise security check by the resi-
dent advisors of dormitory doors , 
to make sure that they were 
locked . 

According to program coordi-
nator Lorna Hirae, the surprise 
check was co nd ucted "j us t to ma ke 
students aware of their own safety. 
They need to understand the little 

focused on controversial is ues 
related to men, women, alcohol, 
sex, and crime. 

Westerfield said that although 
rape is a "touchy subject ," it is 
necessary to talk about it so peo-
ple will better understand the 
seriousness of the crime. 

"There will not be any right or 
wrong answers necessarily, but [a 
dialogue] will provide informa-

tion and create thoughts for future 
discussions," Wahlig added . 

According to FBI reports, rape 
occurs across the nation at a rate 
of one rape every three minutes. 

A primary purpose for the dis-
cussion was to show students what 
resource are available to them 
both on and off campus, should 
they themselves or anyone they 
know be victimized. 

With the intention of increas-
ing student awarene s about per-
sonal safety as well as campus and 
community resource available to 
students , a Crime Prevention and 
Safety Awareness Day was held 
last Wednesday, on the Revelle 
Plaza . 

The program was sponsored by 
the Revelle College Dean's office, 
the Revelle Resident Dean's office, 
and the Student Safety Aware-
ness Program. 

Organizations represented in-
cluded the Women's Resource 
Center, Legal Services, Student 
Health Services, the Rape Crisis 
Center, Transportation Services, 
and the San Diego City Police 
Department.

Although business may

Lai said. 

Woodard said the store cur-
rently makes approximately 50 
sales per day, which is not enough 
to cover expenses. At the new 

location, just to "break even," he 
said the the store would have to 
make at least 157 sales per day. 

"It's possible to turn 
the place around as

The Price Center is not to 

blame for the effort to di con-
tinue Assorted Vinyl, according 
to Woodard, who explained that 
the store would have to be closed 
anyway. 

Despite Assorted Vinyl's deficit 
track record, Lai maintains that 

the store fills a real student need, 
because of the convenience, ser-
vice, and low prices that it offers 
its customers. 

"We undercut all chain stores 
[and] we are very competitive 
with independent stores," she said. 
- Lai pointed out that Assorted 

Vinyl is the only student enter-
prise offering a product other 
than basic necessities, like food or 
class materials. 

"We are unique in that we're 
vending luxury items," she added .

appeal to the Council at tomor-

Professors Discuss the Role of Research 
By ERIC PRINGER 
Contributing Writer 

As UCSD grows, the faculty 
finds it. harder to define the role of 
professors . A young university. 
rapidly expanding, need t o 
address the subject of research 
versus teaching. 

Dr. William Fitzgerald, of the 
literature department, aid of this 
dilemma. "Education ha corne to 
a point where we have to rethink 
the relation between re earch and 
teaching, what we expect of the 
professors, what the University is 
as an institution; what is it doing? 
All that has come t.o a crucial 
moment where ome rethinking 
has to be done.~ 

Fitzgerald acknowledge:! that 
the role of teaching is econdary 
to that of research. and added 
that teaching i not a guaran tee 
for promotion. 

"[Teaching] is omething that 
i aJded on as a sort of decoration 
to case for promotion. You will 
not get promoted. "-hatever your 
teaching is like. unle }OU have 
achie\ed a certain degree of \ i i-
bility as a publishing scholar. and 

published a certain quantIty of 
stuff and a certain qual ity. After 
that. people may talk about teach-
ing," he said . 

"Hiring and promotion is done 
on the basis of research and it 
produces a sort of disjunction 
between what people are judged 
on because the University is a 
teaching institution. lthink that's 
really the root of the problem,fl 
Fitzgerald added . 

As a means for a solution, he 
proposed that the University re-
examine its criteria for promotion 
and put more emphasis on teach-
ing. 

The demand for publication is 
o great that beginning professor 

have a hard time teaching when 
they know that tenure has little to 
do with teaching ability, he added . 

~ot all profe sors ag ree with 
Fitzgerald on the role of teachi ng. 
or e\ en the extent to which it is 
econdar to research. Dr. Paul 
altman, of the Biology depart-

ment. pointed out that teaching 
benefitted from the research done 
in his labs. 

"We are the cutttng edge of 
cience. I take th at into my class-

room," he aid . 

Toxies in Workplace 

Dr. Paul Saltman feels there is no problem with the role of teac 
and that UCSD provides an excellent education through its facilities. 

In Saltman's opinion, there is 
no problem with the role of teach-
ing or the quality of teachers. 
"Eighty percent of the classes in 
the biology department a re taught 
by enior staff. I can list colleague 
after colleague who is a great 

teacher and they're in the class-
rooms," he said . 

He views UCSD as a research 
in titution that provides an excel-
lent education through it facilities 
and the fact that it teachers are 
them elves experts in the fields 

t hey teach . He acknowledged , 
however, that the main thrust of 
effort at UCSD is research. 

The practice of rating a profes-
or for his or her abilities as a 

researcher does not bother 
Saltman. He is of the opinion that 
this preserves the highest stand-
ards of results and material in

" But hey, we're in the class-
[room] too. The best scientists are 
also the ones teaching the lower

Saltman likens the environment 
of UCSD to the NBA, where only 
the best play. At UCSD, he ex-
plained, only the best do research. 
Ifthat means heavy research loads

of judgement abou t which i more 
important of all these: research or 
teaChing or university service, 
really the three major criteria that 
all faculty are judged on . .. is 
unclear to me," Hull said . He 
maintains that the peer review 
process allows for faculty to review 
professors and then recommend 
to the administration whether to 
give tenure and promotions. 

"Nobody gets hired to the facul-
ty who isn't proposed by the 
departmental faculty," he ex-
plained . 

He added that the recom-
mended person is a lmost a lways 
hired, promoted , or tenured . 
"Ninety-nine and a half percent of 
the recommendations are accepted 
by the administration," he said. 

The dilemma of whether to 
research or teach lies within the 
responsibil ity of the individ ual 
departments. Hull pointed out 
that because the faculty run both

things people are doing in re-
search, which is becoming more 
theoretically complica ted , and 
the need to communicate with 
students, to put thing. across with-
out a very technical vocabulary." 

Akin to this is the sense of 
alienation that Deedee Halleck, 
of the communication depart-
ment , claims is slowly over-

whelming UCSD. She explained 
that as the University grows, the 
students and professors feel more 
distant and apathy sets in . She 
sees the bureacracy of the adminis-
tration as key to this distance. 
Both Magde and Hull agreed that 
the problems now affecting the 
University stem, to a degree, from 

See TEACHING, pale 13

ing, it is really the faculty who are 
pushing hard for research over 
teaching. 

Dr. Doug Magde, vice chai r-
man for undergraduate affairs at 
the department of chemistry, 
views the overall situation as too 
complex to si ngle out even the 
issue of research versus teaching. 
In his opinion, the rapid growth 
of the University has raised ques-
tions about the exact ratio between 
teaching, research, and public ser-
vice that should be aimed for. 

In general, Magde concurred 
with Salt man on the effectivene s 
of teaching and its place relative 
to research. While not content to 
consider the University perfect, 
Magde aid, "I'm satisfied that 
we're basically moving in the right 
direction and I don't see a need, at 
this time , for revolutionary 
changes." 

Magde added that research and 
teaching reinforce each other to 
a degree and cited the increase of 
specialization as a serious prob-
lem. 

"What I think we fac ulty have 
as our challenge is how to recruit 
and retain and encourage people, 
not who are interested in teaChing 
as well as in research , but who are 
interested in teaching broad issues 
and researching broad issues," he 
said. 

Fitzgerald echoed this theme, 
adding, "It's becoming more and 
more difficult to see how to make 
connections between the kind of

the bureacratic manner of the

Joel Kovel, a formcr vis iting 
professor from Bard College, said 
that colleges without large bureau-
cracies offer s t udents a personal-
ized ed uca tion. "The students are 
individ ually known to the fac ulty

bility is teaching, [Bard is] not a

between professors a nd students

win this one a much a s anybody on th is campus, but 
let's face it: they're not going to. T he United S tates 
Internationa l University (US I U). our neighbors d own 
off Miramar Road somewhere, competes in Division I 
of the NCAA. That may not ma ke much d iffe rence to 
our water polo or fencing teams (to name a couple) 
who ·compete with and consistently beat Division I 
schools, but in basketball , it makes a big difference. I 
really don't care if USIU (7- 13) lost to the Syracuse 
Orangemen by 30 points or whatever earlier this year, 
because we would have lost to them by twice that 
much, Admittedly, UCSD (5-9) has been playing bet-
ter ba ll of la te, winning two of three before getting 
sto mped by Redland s on Saturday night. I know that 
eight points is con id ered a pretty big spread in bas-
ketball, but US I U. unless it has a n off day. should be 
a ble to cover it. I think it 's evid ent tha t Phil wants you 
to give the point a nd ...

because Poi nt Lorna was shoot-

end of the ga me. both teams had 
improved their shooting percen-

35 percent. 

Senior T racy Ragatz. one o f 
the team leaders wit h 12 points, 
fou r as ist • and seven rebounds, 
said tha t UCS D "came into the 
game wi th revenge on [t hei r]

Poi nt Lorna took advantage of

The econd ha lf was a battle o f

were nine diffe rent lead changes

major factor in the comeback. 
She scored six of her 16 points

However, accordi ng to Malone,

Continued from p.ce 18 
serie of critical hots to maintain 
the all-im portant three-poi nt 
margin. In addition. junior guard 
Nancy Caparaz. who only stand 
5'3" tall, added two criticallayups 
to complement the free throws. 

Five UCSD players scored in 
double figures, with Koster's 16 
leading the way. Ragatz had 12, 
Caparaz I I, Bernadette Diepen-
brock chipped in 10, and Beth 
Koenig added 12 points of her 
own. two of them being in the 
waning seconds of the game at the 
free throw line. 

H ope to be this year's "Senior Speal~er" at Muir's Graduation? Auditions (prior sign-up required) will be on Friday 
afternon, January 28. 

To schedule your audition with Muir's Grad-
uation (ommitree, see Kim in the Dean's 
office CH&SS 2126). 

With a 9-4 record halfway 
through the season, the Tritons 
head east to meet Amherst Col-
lege and then Colby, Smith Col-
lege, and Trinity College in the 
Smith College Invi tational. Ma-
Ione says the trip east will "be a 
real battle, a real test of what 
we've got." Ragatz agrees, and 
says she "is looking forward to the 
trip since the team doesn't get to 
travel very much." 

At the audition you will read the remarl~ 
which you propose to deliver at Graduation. 
Selection w ill be based equally on content 
and delivery of your proposed speech. If 
you have additional questions, discuss them 
with Dean Chips Dreilinger (534-3587).

Students, your assignment today is 
to learn how to use the Smith Corona 
XL 2500 typewriter. 

Ooops. don't get too settled in your 
seats. The XL 2500 isn't a very difficult 
study. 

In fact, unlike most electronic type-
writers, it's a downright snap to pick up. 

The Spell-RighCSO,OOO word elec-
tronic dictionary adds new meaning to 
the word "simple:' 

WordEraser ' erase entire words at 
a single touch . 

WordFind ' finds your mistakes before 
anyone else can. 

The XL 2500 even makes correcting 
mistakes as easy as making them. 

With the Smith Corona Correcting 
Cassette, you simply pop 
in your correction tape. 

There are no spools 
to unwind . . . no com-
plicated threading 
. . . no tangles. 

order to get in. " We need to play 
one game at a time and stay 
focused . . . as soon as we start 
thinking playoffs we won't make 
them, " aid Malone. 

However, Ragatz speculated 
that the Tritons can "only afford 
to lose maybe two more games 
this season." he did add that the 
team is "preparing day by day and 
is not thinking playoffs yet." Using 
Ragatz's projection, UCSD needs 
to finish 20-6 to make the playoffs.

Division II schools, all in two 
games. 

Outstanding play from team-
captain Nick Rothman, setter 
John Childers, and outside-hitter 

ate Brown was exhibited through-
out the tournament, where the 
Tritons beat the teams they were 
supposed to beat, and played the 
others tough. 

Upcoming matches do not get 
any easier, as three Division I 
teams visit the Triton Pavilion.

Although the Tritons have no 
chance for a playoff berth with 
their 5-9 record , t hey plan on pre-
venting such incidents in the future 
with the help of fan support . 
Remember: "Only you can help 
take a bite out of crime." 

Sophomore Eric Quigley

Of course, we've also added lots 

of other fine features to the XL 2500. 
There's full line correction, Auto 

Half-Space, Auto Center, even our Right 
Ribbon System;" which automatically 
prevents you from using the wrong 
combination of ribbon and correcting 
cassette. 

Oh, one more feature we forgot to 
mention - the price. You'll be happy to 
hear that the XL 2500 is surprisingly 
affordable. 

So you see, the XL 2500 
won't just make your writing 
easier.

your economics.

Men's Volleyball goes 5-3 
at UCSB Invitational 

By DANA CHAIKEN 
Staff Writer 

I n one of the toughest fields 
it will see all year, the UCSD 
mens's volleyball team finished 
with a respectable 5-3 record in 
the season-opening UCSB In-
vitational Tournament this past 
weekend. 

En route to a third-place 
standing in their pool, the 
Tritons lost to powerhouses 
USC 15-8, 16-14,and BYU 15-
12, 15-11, but rebounded to 
soundly defeat Cal-Berkeley 
15-5, 15-7. 

In seeded bracket play, where 
the top two teams from each 

pool played for first through 
twelfth, and the second two 
from each could do no better 
than thirteenth, UCSD's loss 
to BYU sent them into the bot-
tom half. The Tritons pounded 
Fresno State in two, but were 
edged by Humboldt State in 
three to close out Friday's 
competition. 

Saturday proved an immen-
sely successful day for the 
young Tritons, IS they picked 
up three more victories and a 
fifteenth place finish in the 24 
team open field of mostly Div-
ision I and II team .

The tory you are about to read 

is true. None of the names or pla-
ces have been changed to protect 
the innocent. This story has been 
taken from the files of the 
Guardian port page and is 
named" omedy of Error ." 

The crime took place last Sat-
urday evening when the UC San 
Diego Tritons fell victim to a 120-
99 rout by the Redlands Bulldogs. 

"The first half really killed us," 
aid Head Coach Tom Mar hall 

as the Tritons trailed the Bulldogs 
by a score of 64-41. "You have to 
be one hell of a team to come back 
from a 23 point deficit. " 

The Tritons seemed to come 
out with a different attitude dur-
ing the econd half as they out-
scored the Bulldogs 58-56, but to 
no avail - they continued to 
make co tly errors that finally 
brought them down. 

The Triton did not just com-
mit one error, but a variety of 
them, which ultimately made it 
child's play for their assailants to 
take advantage of them. 

Their first mistake was obvious 
- they mi sed eleven lay-ups dur-
ing the entire game which could 
have ea ily turned it around. 

Their second mistake was also 
easy to spot, as the Tritons com-
mitted 20 turnovers, due in part 
to a full court press by the Bull-
dogs. Because the Tritons could 
not get the ball on the money with 
their passes, the Bulldogs stepped 
in and cashed in on Triton tur-
novers for easy lay-ups. 

The Tritons' next mistake (and 
probabl their biggest) was not 
converting rebounds. In the first 
half, the Tritons pulled down 14 
offensive rebounds, but could only 
convert one of them for two 
points. In total, UCSD pulled 
down 52 rebounds to Redlands' 
45 . 

"We had to convert our re-
bounds," Marshall said. "If we 
did, it might have been a different 
game." 

If the Tritons thought they had 
it bad enollgh with their own 
errors, the Bulldogs used a wea-
pon that would prove to be even 
more deadly .. . the three point 
shot. Although UCSD actually 
made eight three-pointers, the 
Bulldogs made a total of eleven 
three point shots, and in fact, lead 
the nation with an average of 11.4 
made shots per game. 

The Bulldogs finally guaran-
teed their getaway by substituting 

, in their starters against the Triton 
reserves with over a 20 point lead 
and less than two minutes to play. 

Still, the Tritons did turn in 
some impressive individual efforts. 
Center Greg Kund scored 19 
points, pulled down five rebounds, 
and went 6 for 6 at the free throw 
line. Guard Bill Gerlach also had 
a fine game with 16 points, five 
rebounds, and forward Gordon 
McNeill had 12 points and 12 
rebounds. As a team, UCSD shot 
a sluggish 41 percent from the 
floor, while Redlands shot an 
impressive 60 percent. In addi-
tion, UCSD and Redlands were 
pretty much even at the line, as 
both teams shot around 70 

UCSD Turns the 
Tables on Point 
Loma Nazarene 

By DAVID POTICHA 
Staff Writer 

"Sweet revenge." The e were 
the words used by head coach 
Judy Malone to describe the Triton 
women's ba ketball team's two-
point victory over Point Lorna 
Nazarene on Friday night. By 
beating Point Lorna 69-67, UCSD 
avenged a two-point loss to that 
team on opening day. 

The game was a mixture of the 
good , the bad. and the ugly, a the 

refs allowed a great deal of con-
tact underneath and chose to iso-
late on traveling calls . Said 
Malone, "We had one of these 
refs last time we played [Point] 
Lorna and all he was interested in 
wa calling the traveling viola-
tions." UCSD was called for 15 
traveling violation in the game. 

percent. 
"Basically, our biggest problem 

is that we're young and inexpe-
rienced. Everyone on the team 
works really hard and is develop-
ing slowly, but the truth is that 
there are a lot of people better
