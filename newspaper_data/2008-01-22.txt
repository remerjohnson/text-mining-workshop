With enrollment at UCSD project-
ed to increase dramatically over the 
next few years, the offices of Campus 
Planning and Transportation & 
Parking Services have released a joint 
report aimed at providing solutions for 
the massive influx of traffic expected 
to accompany campus growth through 
the year 2013. 

The report recommends expand-
ed use of mass transit, parking eli-
gibility restrictions and new parking 
structures as solutions to alleviate 
projected traffic problems. The All-
Campus Commuter Board, however, 
has already started a massive campaign 
to protest the construction of any pro-
posed structure, particularly one in the 
School of Medicine.

The report’s study took into account 
parking lot use by students, faculty and 
staff as well as other sources of cam-
pus traffic, including patients seeking 
treatment from UCSD’s health care 
services, prospective students and their 
families touring the campus and visi-
tors from the greater San Diego area 
coming for sporting events, lectures 
and performances.

The report predicts a campus pop-
ulation increase of 5,300 over the next 
five years. To accommodate the influx, 
new academic and residential build-
ings will be constructed on some exist-
ing lots during that period, decreasing 
the number of lots available on campus 
by the 2012-13 school year. 

But the decrease means that in five 
years, only 4 percent of the parking 
spaces on campus will be vacant dur-
ing peak usage — a full percentage 
point below the 5 percent vacancy rate 
that T&PS deems optimal. Previously, 
UCSD targeted a 10 percent level, 
which was recalculated and lowered in 
light of modern operational efficien-
cies and cost-containment goals.

Proposed construction of a new 
parking structure in the School of 
Medicine would require increasing 
student fees anywhere between 4.5 
percent to 10.2 percent per year, the 
report said. Annual fee increases have 
never exceeded 5 percent in the past.  

If the plan is approved, the fee 
increases could start as early as this 
coming year and continue until the 
2012-13 school year, the estimated 
date of completion for the struc-
ture.

The audit that recommended an external pro-
grammatic review of UCSD’s Preuss School is now 
being criticized by two opposing parties: a group of 
professors who claim the report was biased against the 
school’s ex-principal and several former employees 
who allege that it minimized her role in the grade-
changing scandal.

In a Jan. 15 letter written to Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox and Preuss Board of Directors Chair Cecil 
Lytle, a group of five UCSD professors questioned the 
audit’s methodology, saying that the statistical analysis 
of altered grades was flawed because the transcripts 
examined did not constitute a random sample from 
all of the school’s grades. Investigators from UCSD’s 
Audit and Management Advisory Services found that 
144 of 190 transcripts they reviewed contained at least 
one or more errors, 72 percent of which improved the 
affected students’ records.

The report’s conclusions were not based on a ran-
domly selected sample of grades, the letter said, and 
therefore the auditors could not definitively eliminate 
the possibility that the altered grades were due to 
chance.

“It is theoretically possible, and easily testable, that 
the actual error rates in the Preuss transcripts may be 
very small, and that the bulk of these errors may be 
random and unintentional,” the letter stated.

The professors also questioned the implication of 
ex-Principal Doris Alvarez, who resigned on Dec. 18 
after the audit concluded that she “likely had knowl-
edge of and/or directed inappropriate grade changes.” 
They said most of the evidence of Alvarez’s complic-
ity was based on testimony given by former Preuss 

Two Camps Dispute Preuss Audit’s Validity

Students at UCSD’s nationally recognized Preuss School await the results of a second outside investigation into the charter school’s operations.

Registrar Pearline Khavarian, whom Alvarez said she 
terminated in April for changing her daughter’s grade 
on a transcript.

Biology professor Terrence Sejnowski, one of the 
letter’s authors, said the group first met Alvarez sev-
eral years ago while collaborating on a learning center 
project. According to Sejnowski, the professors were 
impressed by Alvarez’s integrity, and became con-
cerned whether they should continue collaborating 
with her after the audit was released.

“When we read the audit carefully we could simply 
not make a decision based on it,” Sejnowski said in an 
e-mail. “We became concerned that a grave injustice 

was being committed against Dr. Alvarez.”
However, Khavarian’s former assistant said grade 

changing was a common practice done with admin-
istrators’ full knowledge, and that the grade changes 
were primarily focused on students in the bottom 
third of their classes.

“These were not random grade changes,” said 
Julianne Singer, a volunteer who worked in Khavarian’s 
office from 2004 to 2006. “They were targeted at 
[Advanced Placement] classes. That will tell you what 
was changed and why. When [Alvarez] said this is

New Campus Construction Goes Greener

COURTESY OF UNIVERSITY COMMUNICATIONS

UCSD will soon install portable rooftop weather stations, which will gather data about the 
campus’ climate conditions and assist administrators in preserving environmental sustanability.

By Christina Homer
Staff Writer

UCSD’s 1,200-acre campus: cool 
ocean breezes caress joggers along 
Torrey Pines, the Eucalyptus forest 
peppers passing students with shade 
and Regent’s Lot bakes drivers in its 
desert heat. A team of campus sci-
entists will finish a complete weather 
monitoring project later this year 
studying these different microcli-
mates in the hopes of making UCSD 
more environmentally friendly. 

The Jacobs School of Engineering 
team is working closely with the 
Environment and Sustainability 
Initiative, the Office of the Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs Steven 
W. Relyea, Wells Fargo and car com-
pany Johnson Controls to design 
and install up to 30 portable weather 
stations on university building roof-
tops. The Real-Time Observations for 
Environmental Sustainability project 
will gather data about the campus’ 
temperature, rainfall, humidity and 
wind-speed. 

Eventually, the system will be 
completely automatic, with local, low-
power computers collecting the data 
from each weather station and wire-
lessly transmitting that information to 
a data server for analysis. 

“The system is unique in that the 
data producers — the scientists — 
work hand-in-hand with data users 
— UCSD facilities management — to 
facilitate knowledge transfer and real-
world use of the data,” said Jan Kleissl, 
mechanical and aerospace engineer-
ing professor. 

The data collected from these 
weather stations will be used to help 
reduce the campus’ energy use by 
allowing the environment to more 
precisely cool or heat buildings. In 
addition, scientists will attempt to 
optimize irrigation methods and 
determine how effective solar power 
would be on campus.

Another important facet of this 
program is the degree to which it 
bridges disciplines, with many depart-
ments across the university joining 
forces for this unique project.

The new system is part of UCSD’s 
participation in the Chicago Climate 
Exchange, a voluntary U.S. market 
where members attempt to lower their 
carbon dioxide footprint by a prede-
termined amount over a fixed time. 
UCSD Energy and Utilities Manager 
John Dilliott said that if UCSD does 
not accomplish the required reduc-
tion in emissions, it will be required 
to purchase credit from the exchange. 
On the other hand, if UCSD achieves 
more reductions than the amount 
stipulated in its quota it can sell cred-
its back to the system.

The process is similar to the “cap 
and trade” scheme in place for the 
European Union, said Dilliott. CCX is 
currently a pilot program scheduled 
to end in 2010, whose goal is to prove 
that this type of system can impact 
global warming.

“UCSD does not anticipate profit-
ing from its participation in the pro-
gram; our analysis showed that we 
could break even, thus having no net 
impact to the campus budget but still 
allowing UCSD to gain experience 

in a system that will inevitably be 
adopted in California and the U.S.,” 
Dilliot said.

In addition to making the cam-
pus more environmentally friendly, 
professors are using this program as a 
teaching opportunity to demonstrate 
how environmental studies can be 
applied to the real world. A diverse 
team of students, with majors ranging 
from environmental engineering and 
mechanical engineering to computer 
science and political science is work-
ing on the project. 

Kleissl said some students have 
been working on the project through 
the Jacobs School, ESI and other local 
companies who are supplying fund-
ing. Some students are also doing 
internships and independent research 

associated with the project. 
“UCSD’s participation [in the 

CCE] will also allow for student 
involvement in the process, especially 
in the field of environmental econom-
ics, which will be an exploding field in 
the near future and in need of leader-
ship and expertise,” Dilliot said.

The campus has invested $50 mil-
lion to improve its energy usage since 
2001, Relyea said. However, these 
changes are expected to save the uni-
versity about $10.5 million annually 
in energy costs. 

The weather stations are expected 
to be installed by the end of this 
year.

In addition to the possible student-
fee increases, permit prices would 
increase anywhere from 19 to 63 per-
cent. For example, a monthly student 
parking pass that currently costs $61 
could cost as much as $100 by 2013.

The report notes a concern that 
the large fee increases could discour-
age permit sales, which could in turn 
transform the proposed parking struc-
ture into a financial sinkhole.

ACCB President Jerrod Zertuche 
said the example of parking structures 
built at San Diego State University in 
2006 provides a convincing example 
of why a new parking structure should 
not be built at UCSD. 

Parking permit costs were increased 
to help fund the construction of the 
parking structures at SDSU. However, 
the increase deterred students from 
buying permits, and the combina-
tion of this funding shortage and the 
increased construction staff costs 
caused the university’s parking fund to 
fall into a deficit.

ACCB students fear that a simi-
lar situation would result if UCSD 
were to approve a similar parking 
structure, and are heavily campaign-
ing against the proposal. The group 
said that numerous parking spots are 
still available on campus and that the 
pursuit of alternative forms of trans-
portation is more likely to achieve 
administrators’ desired goals. 

The report estimated that a com-
bination of transportation alternatives 
and parking eligibility restrictions 
would be the most cost-effective way 
of eliminating the need for almost 
4,000 additional parking spaces.

Twenty-one percent of available 

Report Considers Impact of  
Parking Restrictions, Fee Hikes
▶ PARKING, from page 1 campus parking spots were found 

to be vacant during peak hours last 
September.

“Look at the Hopkins Parking 
structure — there is a whole floor of V 
spaces that isn’t used at all,” Zertuche 
said. “That’s what’s going to happen 
to the new parking structure, I guar-
antee it.”

The campus carpooling rate has 
increased from 58 percent to 66 per-
cent since 2001, while rideshares and 
buses have also become more popular 
and reliable alternatives for commut-
ing to campus.

A planned Regional Transit Pass 
would allow UCSD affiliates to ride all 
public transportation services through-
out San Diego County, coupling with 
an expected boost in public transpor-
tation in the next decade.

The report found that placing a 
parking restriction on all freshmen 
would free up as many as 1,000 spaces, 
though such restrictions have never 
before been necessary. A few hundred 
more spaces could be opened up with 
the help of a proposed policy that 
encourages bicycling and other non-
motorized transportation.

If all these plans are implement-
ed, as many as 4,300 spaces — more 
spots than a proposed structure 
could offer — would be opened up 
for parking.

Over the next few weeks, T&PS 
will be holding open forums on the 
matter, and a nine-person committe 
of administrators, students and faculty 
will vote on the proposed structure in 
early February.

human error, nothing about this was 
human error.”

Singer said she and Khavarian were 
asked to replace grades — in what 
is referred to as the school’s internal 
grade suppression policy — after the 
student had retaken a course he or 
she had failed. However, Singer said 
she was alarmed by the high number 
of grade changes she was requested to 
perform, especially when the second 
course was not equivalent in difficulty 
to the first.

For example, Singer said Alvarez told 
Khavarian and former teacher Jennifer 
Howard that failing grades from a 2006 
AP European History class were not 
equivalent to grades earned in a subse-
quent six-week summer school course, 
but then apparently told Khavarian to 
replace the grades anyway.

“When we protested, we were told 
these orders came from the top,” Singer 
said. “This was not a secretive, surrepti-
tious process. Everyone knew what I 
was doing. I was shocked this was so 
casual.”

In one instance in 2005, Singer said 
Alvarez watched over her shoulder as 
she replaced grades with ones from 
other courses.

However, Alvarez has repeatedly 
denied any knowledge of grade changes, 
arguing that it would violate the school’s 
educational mission of preparing its 
students to succeed in college.

Khavarian’s termination was made 
official in April, and Howard’s contract 
was not renewed in June. Howard is 
currently pursuing legal action against 
the university and has refused multiple 
requests for comment.

The auditors found that Preuss 
administrators need to develop an 
internal grade suppression policy mir-
roring that of the San Diego Unified 
School District, which co-charters the 
school with UCSD.

The audit report also stated that 
Khavarian admitted to changing her 
daughter’s grade, but that her testimony

Letter, Insider: Campus Should Reopen Audit
▶ AUDIT, from page 1 was still considered credible because it 

was corroborated by Singer and other 
parties. Singer disputed this claim, say-
ing that Khavarian was used as a scape-
goat by Alvarez, whom she once consid-
ered a close family friend.

“Not only would Pearline not have 
changed the grades, but she never would 
have admitted to doing it,” Singer said. 

According to Singer, there was a 
specific protocol in place regarding the 
grades of Khavarian’s two children, so 
that she would never be accused of tam-
pering with their transcripts. Former 
head counselor Carol Sobek — who was 
also implicated in the audit as having 
likely knowledge of the grade changes 
— would pull the Khavarian children’s 
report cards and enter the grades into 
their transcripts herself.

Khavarian has been unable to prove 
her innocence because her access to 
grade reporting software and her UCSD 
e-mail account were revoked the same 
day Alvarez terminated her, Singer said. 
Khavarian declined an interview at the 
advice of her lawyer.

In addition, both Alvarez and the 
group of professors attacked the audi-
tors for what they called potentially 
“leading questions” that could have led 
employees to falsely accuse Alvarez of 
wrongdoing.

“My question is how did they ask 
questions of people?” Alvarez said 
shortly after the audit’s release. “If you 
ask a question in a particular way, you’ll 
get a particular answer.”

Singer, however, defended the 
auditors’ professionalism and the way 
in which the interviews were con-
ducted.

“The men in the auditing depart-
ment worked very hard,” she said. “For 
[Alvarez] to go about impugning their 
work is unconscionable. They did an 
excellent job, and while I have quibbles 
with some of their findings, they went 
to exhaustive lengths.”

Former Preuss School government 
teacher Greg Campbell, who taught 
during the 2003-04 school year and 

testified in the audit, said he had no 
concern about the way in which his 
interview was conducted.

“[The auditors] were very profes-
sional and asked very good questions, 
much more of the open-ended type,” 
Campbell said. “They were deliberate 
and prepared to let the teacher do most 
of the talking.”

Singer said any flaws in the audit’s 
conclusions were due to a lack of coop-
eration by specific Preuss employees, 
whom she said went to great lengths 
to keep pertinent evidence from the 
investigators. The auditors noted they 
could not find any original Scantron 
grade entry forms for a majority of 
the affected transcripts, but could not 
determine the cause of their disappear-
ance. While Alvarez said the records 
were kept in a locked storage facility 
and monitored by a staff member she 
declined to identify, Singer said the key 
code to enter the room was available to 
many Preuss employees.

“Everyone had access,” she said. “I 
even went in several times. It was cer-
tainly not private.”

The university can determine 
administrators’ culpability with greater 
certainty by taking a closer look at 
where those records could have gone, 
Singer said.

“The audit and its conclusions 
were too limited due to the evidence 
that was not made available to them,” 
she said.

The letter asked Fox and Lytle to 
reopen and further investigate the audit, 
while Singer is currently advocating for 
an additional investigation to be con-
ducted by the UCSD Academic Senate.

Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning Gary C. 
Matthews is currently interviewing out-
side consulting firms to perform an 
external examination of the school’s 
operating procedures, as recommended 
by the auditors.

It’s no secret that our world is going to end one day. Even if our planet never faces a cosmic 
natural disaster and the Bible is wrong 
about Jesus coming back to destroy the 
sinners, after x-billion years, the sun 
will use up its hydrogen supply and 
eventually die, swallowing our puny 
planet in the process and destroying 
human civilization as we know it.

Just ask the History Channel, which 
loves to air Armageddon-day specials 
on topics originating from possibilities 
as real as extinction-level (read: dino-
style) asteroid collisions to the ridicu-
lous prophecies of 16th-century French 
mystic and apothecary Nostradamus.

I watched a program this week-
end detailing apocalyptic scenarios for 
which mankind should prepare. Among 
them were super-massive volcanic erup-
tions, asteroid collisions (obviously), 
worldwide nuclear war, uncontrollable 
pandemics and — President George 
W. Bush’s favorite scientific evidence to 
refute  — irreversible global warming 
(insert rising sea levels here).

And that’s all fine and dandy. To 
be honest, I’ve already planned for 
those situations, should they happen to 
occur. In fact, I think everyone would 
do the same thing: get drunk and run 
around like crazy people. 

I mean, really, what else would 
you do if you knew an asteroid the 
size of Nebraska was about to smash 
into Earth? And consider how people 
would react if a Rage-esque epidemic 
swept the planet or a multiple-megaton 
nuclear warhead was going to hit their 
neighborhood in T-minus 12 minutes. 

Although it’s true that our planet 
faces threats of cosmic proportions, I 
think more attention should be paid 
to here-and-now problems that are 
actually solvable. Where’s the two-hour 
History Channel special about ending 5 
p.m. traffic gridlock on La Jolla Village 
Drive? And what about an educational 
program on the Discovery Channel 
about using your blinker properly? 
(Come on people, the blinker makes 
that annoying clicking sound for a rea-
son — how the hell do you not realize 
you left it on?)

Seriously, I don’t really care about 
being engulfed Pompeii-style by magma 
from some undiscovered volcano. I just 
want people to learn how to merge 
correctly, because then I could actually 
move more than five feet per hour on 
the I-5 freeway during rush hour.

Common roadway dilemmas 
such as incompetent lane-changers 
(you gotta want it, people) are among 
the most complex problems facing 
humanity today, yet for some reason 
the History Channel always foolishly 
excludes them from its end-of-the-
world lists.

Unless cable television shapes up 
and addresses real-life apocalyptic sce-
narios like traffic congestion, we’re all 
going to end up rotting in our cars at the 
Rock Bottom intersection. I can only 
pray that humanity realizes that idiotic 
drivers are destroying the planet with 
traffic jams before it’s too late, because 
that asteroid is still a long way off.

ACADEMICS — UCSD is primarily 
reputable for its stellar track record 
in science, which has grown tre-
mendously since its founding less 
than 50 years ago. But there is evi-
dence to suggest that the science 
departments have developed with-
out commensurate growth in the 
arts, overshadowing them.

There are 147 theater majors 
at UCSD, comprising less than 1 
percent of the total undergradu-
ate population of 22,048. Many of 
these students feel neglected by a 
department that grants most of its 
major performance opportunities to 
graduate students.

Once per quarter, the theater 
department faculty stages a pro-
duction solely for undergraduate 
students. These shows provide a 
favorable environment and expo-
sure strikingly close to real-world 
experience. Students audition, make 
the cast and perform under the 
direction of experienced instruc-
tors, unfettered by financial limita-
tions. In these shows, they receive 
attention that would otherwise only 
be given to them in a major pro-
duction. The problem: chances are 
limited. 

“A majority of undergrad stu-
dents I have encountered in theater 
feel somewhat neglected in the sense 
of having the chance to interact with 
faculty on a main stage production,” 
said Daniel Rubiano, a John Muir 

College junior and theater major 
who has auditioned for the Winter 
and Fall Quarter undergraduate 
productions. 

Rubiano added that most theater 
undergrads ultimately want “more 
opportunities to thrive under highly 
educated individuals.” 

These individuals host two or 
three major shows per quarter 
almost entirely with graduate stu-
dents; if an undergrad gains a role, 
it is minimal at best. This is logical 
from the perspective of the depart-
ment, which wants to put on the best 
show possible, but it is not so logical 
from the viewpoint of students. 

Last quarter, the undergraduate 
production was changed to a the-
ater movement piece, a dance-based 
production, thereby robbing actors 
of another precious chance. Put the 
facts together, and you get a very 
unappealing department for under-
grads.

In stark contrast, UCSD’s biol-
ogy department has an incredible 
amount of appeal due to its high 
rankings — second in the nation 
in neuroscience and biotech — and 
links to the prominent local biotech 
sector. Although the department’s 
worldwide recognition has little 
bearing on the lives of new students, 
the distinction greatly increases its 
appeal. Add that to pressure from 
peers, who have a 22-percent chance 
of being biology majors themselves, 
and already the average student feels 
a significant draw toward the sci-
ences. 

Possibilities are the cornerstones 
of a college education, and students 
should dictate their learning envi-
ronment, not vice versa. The under-
graduate population deserves more 
options. Each student pays the same 
tuition (or more if out-of-state), and 
while individual educations are not 
usually comparable in content, they 
must be comparable in terms of 
available opportunities.

This disparity is apparent not just 
in the theater department; biology, 
chemistry and physics have 74, 58 
and 53 tenured professors, respec-
tively, while theater and dance, visu-
al arts and literature have 18, 19 and 
37, respectively. 

“We get nothing,” said Nancy 
Mah, a visual arts department man-
agement service officer. “Being a 
research institution, a lot of money 
goes to science. We might get a big-
ger share of state funds, but we have 
no external funding source, such as 
grants.” 

Grants constitute 37 percent of 
the school’s operating revenue, more 
than tuition and state funds com-
bined.

According to UCSD’s 2007 
Annual Financial Report, the cam-
pus received $507.7 million in the 
form of grants that directly con-
tributed to either the health sci-
ences ($389.3 million) or Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography ($118.3 
million). This constitutes about 70 
percent of the school’s total grant 
revenue. The rest was reserved for 
the benefit of the “general campus.” 

Chemistry Department Financial 
Manager Shanley Miller said that 
although there is no direct cor-
relation between grant money and 
undergraduate education, there is 
certainly an indirect benefit, which 
is magnified given the sheer amount 
of money involved.

Evidently, the funds that go spe-
cifically to the sciences, the fac-
ulty that the money attracts and the 
arts’ reliance on state funds results 
in lopsided growth between the 
departments. UCSD’s prominence 
in biology and other scientific fields 
should not go unmentioned, but the 
university, as well as its undergradu-
ates, should be mindful of the fields 
of study that generous grants sel-
dom cover, which are consequently 
funded much less liberally.

The discrepancy can be repre-
sented in many ways, and the rea-
sons for it are innumerable, includ-
ing inherent factors like the school’s 
location, reputation and the cir-
cumstances of its founding. But the 
situation is alterable. 

As Rubiano suggested, “I hope 
that the students could find an 
arrangement, in the form of petition 
perhaps, that we could present to 
the department.” Steps like this can 
be taken by undergraduates, and 
their collective voices can directly 
benefit arts majors as well as give all 
students more variety in what they 
can achieve as undergraduates.

Research University Neglects Humanities-Minded Undergrads

UCSD Puts Its Money Where Its Climate Research Is
By Marissa Blunschi 
Associate Opinion Editor

ON CAMPUS — The new year at 
UCSD has brought with it renewed 
efforts to continue the university’s 
aggressive attempts to conserve 
energy and further develop the cam-
pus’ reputation as a leader in reduc-
ing carbon-dioxide emissions and 
maintaining a clean, green campus. 

However, in addition to protect-
ing the environment, the universi-
ty’s latest efforts are giving it a head 
start in what is becoming an impor-
tant global sustainability operation. 
UCSD’s latest endeavor in its fight 
against global warming and green-
house gas emissions is its decision 
to become the first university on 
the West Coast to join the Chicago 
Climate Exchange, or CCX, North 
America’s only voluntary trading 
system to reduce greenhouse-gas 
emissions.

With public awareness growing 
over the looming threats of pollu-
tion and climate change, the time 
has come for U.S. corporations and 
institutions to prioritize sustainabil-
ity and emissions reduction. UCSD 
is making a wise investment by 
tackling this issue early and joining 
the climate exchange. The European 
Union has already made it manda-
tory for its largest institutions to 
abide by contracts regulating GHG 
emissions, and it’s not unlikely that 
the United States will soon follow 
suit.

The CCX employs an innova-
tive marketing approach in the fight 
against global warming. It works 
much like a typical market, but the 
commodities traded are fossil fuel-
based greenhouse gases such as car-
bon dioxide, which is a major con-
tributor to global warming. When a 
company or institution joins CCX, it 
signs a contract to reduce emissions 
by a fixed amount over a certain time 
period. Every year, those emissions 

are documented and if the reduc-
tion criteria has not been met, the 
institution is required to purchase 
credits through CCX. However, if a 
reduction has occurred, the institu-
tion can sell or bank those credits. 
This resembles the EU’s incredibly 
effective “cap and trade” scheme, 
which may also be used by the 
state to comply with the recently 
passed Global Warming Solutions 
Act, which requires California to 
reduce its global warming emissions 
to 1990 levels by 2020. 

According to John Dilliott, 
UCSD Energy and Utilities man-
ager, joining the climate exchange 
will provide the university with  
useful experience in a system that 
will almost certainly be adopted in 
California, and the rest of the United 
States, in the impending future. 

Moreover, Dilliot believes that 
UCSD’s involvement will also allow 
students to take an active role in the 
process, particularly in the field of 
environmental economics, which is 
predicted to become increasingly 
important in the coming years. 

UCSD is planning to lower 
on-campus emissions through 
various methods, notably by tar-
geting commuter behavior, one of 
the biggest sources of GHG emis-
sions. Currently, Transportation and 
Parking Services hopes to further 
reduce the number of single-occu-
pancy vehicles traveling to campus 
by negotiating with local agencies 
to develop a regional transit pass for 
UCSD, which would provide stu-
dents, staff and faculty with unlim-
ited access to public transportation 
throughout San Diego County. 

In addition to the T&PS initia-
tives to reduce emissions, several 
other departments on campus are 
working to lower greenhouse gases. 
The Facilities Management depart-
ment, which works on recycling 
habits and environmentally friendly 
renovations, is just one example. 

Each of these efforts has contrib-
uted to sustainability and efficient 
energy use and everything done to 
lower emissions and save energy 
helps reduce the negative impact on 
the environment. All of these efforts 
improve the campus’ ability to posi-
tively influence other universities 
and corporations.

“Because we’ve become much 
more energy efficient and generate 
most of our own power, our campus 
can now sell surplus greenhouse 
gas credits on an open market,” 
said Steven W. Relyea, UCSD Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs. 
“This not only shows our commit-
ment to green practices and reduc-
ing our carbon footprint, but also 
our commitment to employing 
innovative, leading-edge technol-
ogy.” 

UCSD has a history of iden-
tifying the problems of climate 
change, beginning long ago with 
Charles Keeling’s research at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, which 
confirmed the rise of atmospheric 
carbon dioxide and global warming. 
Now, with its reputation as a major 

research university and the power 
to promote awareness of these prob-
lems, UCSD has become a leader in 
identifying innovative solutions for 
global warming. With the help of 
CCX, UCSD’s reputation will con-
tinue to grow and the campus will 
gain the power to become an influ-
ential example for other universities 
and corporations in California and 
nationwide.

Darwin’s Birthday a Reminder 
of Science’s Importance

Dear Editor,
Feb. 12 is the anniversary of the 

birth of the greatest biologist of all time 
— Charles Darwin. He was the first to 
describe biological evolution via natu-
ral selection with scientific rigor, and 
has allowed mankind to reap enor-
mous benefits for advancements in 
medicine, physiology, ecology and our 
basic understanding of the relation-
ships of all living organisms on Earth. 
Darwin’s birthday will be celebrated 
worldwide, including in San Diego 
County.

In a time when science is under 
attack by religious fanatics and politi-
cians of the radical right controlling 
the Republican Party, when many high 
schools and colleges are dropping class-
es in evolution because of pressures 
generated by people steeped in mysti-
cism and mythology, when the word 
“evolution” is avoided by presidential 
and congressional hopefuls — there is a 
great need to pay tribute to Darwin and 
to reverse this dangerous trend away 
from logic, truth and knowledge.

Darwin was the Einstein of modern 
biological and evolutionary principles 
that provided the basis for the second 
law of biology. Attacks on evolution 
undermine accurate, empirical knowl-
edge; they undermine science and its 

pursuit altogether. 
“In science we trust.” 

— Milton Saier
Professor of Molecular Biology

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

F ollowing Congress’ 2003 decision to reopen bidding for the management of three Department of Energy weapons labs previously managed by the University of California, the UC Board of Regents voted to form limited liability corporations with several other companies and submit bids for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory — a decision 
87-year-old Herbert York, LLNL’s first director and UCSD’s first chancellor, called a “dumb idea.”

The new arrangement between the D.O.E. weapons labs and the UC system was decided in 2003, after each lab was marred by allega-
tions of mismanagement earlier in the year. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory discovered accounting irregularities, and Los Alamos 
National Laboratory underwent an entire managerial overhaul and was accused of making improper payments. Following the scandals, 
the D.O.E. and Congress decided to open the bidding process for the labs.

“It may work out; I just don’t know,” York said. “But right now I’m not at all optimistic about the new arrangement … a limited arrange-
ment, from my perspective, is … totally unnecessary, and based on a lot of ideas about [UC] management that weren’t correct.”

Though the UC Regents won the bid to continue managing LBNL in 2005, they voted to form private limited liability corporations with 
other companies in order to bid for LANL and LLNL. Los Alamos National Security, formed by the UC system, Bechtel, BWX Technologies 

and Washington Group International, won the LANL contract in 2005. Similarly, Lawrence Livermore National Security, 
formed by the same companies and including technology giant Battelle, won the LLNL contract in 2007.

But not everyone is pleased with the change. 
“Salaries are changing, many of the top-level people will come out with much higher sala-

ries,” York said. “But a majority of the people don’t like it because of the way it affects 
pensions, health care, relationships, perceptions about intellectual freedom. People 

feel more confident in the University of California than they do in the Bechtel 
Corporation, that’s all. So there’s no doubt that the people at the laborato-

ries want it the way it was.”
Although LLNS spokesperson Lynda Seaver claims the lab’s 
salary structure remains the same, and choices of pension 

packages are substantially equivalent to those offered 
under the UC system, the lab suffered from a series 

of layoffs starting in December, shortly after the 
changeover from UC system to LLC. About 500 

employees have been let go so far, and, accord-
ing to the goals LLNL Director George Miller 

set at an all-hands meeting with employ-
ees, he would like another 10 percent 

to leave the lab. The changeover has 
reportedly resulted in $130 million 

in increased costs.
“Until mid-December 

[2007], the Laboratory, like all 
other national laboratories, 

The only thing I knew about the trip before setting sail was that I ought to dress in layers because it gets cold out on the open ocean. A week before shoving off, I 
had showed up late to the meeting in which the organizers of 
the Oceanids’ and International Club’s annual trip brief par-
ticipants on the natural history of the Gray Whale. I already 
knew enough from a marine biology class to know the species 
spends August in Alaska to feed and January in Baja to mate 
or give birth, passing by San Diego along the way. So after 
showing up at the meeting to find everyone else gone, my two 
questions for the organizers were where to sign up and if very 
large cameras were allowed on the boat.

A half-hour before leaving dry land, I was cursing Mission 
Bay for making my vessel so obscure. I drove past the boat 
three times, missing it in the stretches of masts and sails that 
line the artificial harbor. With the scheduled departure time 
just a few minutes away, I took a guess as to where I ought to 
be, parked my car and was relieved to find half the group still 
waiting to board.

Our boat, the New Seaforth, was a decent size — big 
enough to comfortably hold the 130 or so people I had heard 
the crew count off. The number of seats was fewer than travel-
ers, though. The railing, I imagined, was low enough for my 
center of gravity to allow me to flip over the side should a 
rogue wave come along. I walked the perimeter looking for 
anything interesting, and I was satisfied to find I had the larg-
est lens of anyone with a camera.

The real stragglers showed up with not a minute to spare, 
communicating via cell phone to friends on board in order 
to make sure the boat would not leave without them. It made 
for reunions that would have been touching, had I not been 
anxiously ready to get on with the whale watching. My impa-
tience subsided as we passed the jetty and I felt the cool wind 
of the Pacific.

The sea was too choppy for pictures through a long lens, 
so I used a wide angle to work the boat, picking out foreigners 
pouring over cell phones and other attendees that were poorly 
dressed for maritime activities. The impression I got was of a 
floating city bus, and with some enthusiastic watchers dressed 
to the hilt, they had the appearance of homeless people.

When we had been out on the open water for maybe half 
an hour and already seen a small group of common dolphins, 
I was worried that the ride would not smooth out enough 
for me to be able to use my trusty telephoto. The captain’s 
voice came on over external speakers, advising us to just 
bend over the rail should we need to throw up. I was thankful 
that I didn’t get seasick, although I was still careful. Looking 
through a camera can amplify the feeling of the world slosh-
ing around beneath your feet and make even the strongest 
stomachs turn. Sure enough, a friend of mine who by chance 
had taken the same boat could not take any pictures for want 
of Dramamine.

It was a great relief when the boat slowed down once we

By Vanessa Do
Senior Staff Writer

When Sixth College junior Ginny 
Tice first stepped foot in University 
of Westminster’s Cavendish Campus 
in London, she was struck with fas-
cination. Not only were robe-clad 
wizards and witches interacting with 
non-magical folk, there were even a 
few Arithmancy and Divination classes 
being held and a game of Quidditch 
underway.

Tice is part of an Internet subcul-
ture called fandom — a group of fans 
who share the same interest or activ-
ity in a specific work of fiction. The 
appeal of this fantasy world led Tice 
to London, where she attended Sectus, 
a renowned convention dedicated to 
Harry Potter.

“It was my first convention and my 
first trip to Europe, which probably ate 
up all the money I earned that sum-
mer,” she said. “However, getting 
to see all the places mentioned in 
the books, and more important-
ly, getting to meet a lot of cool 
people with similar interests was 
very surreal.”

Although fandoms began in 
the late ’60s and early ’70s with 
the start of fanzines and the TV 
show Star Trek, the use of the 
Internet has expanded their 
popularity.

 “Suddenly, anyone obsessed 
with something obscure or not so 
obscure, or with a certain paring 
or type of fiction could generally 
find a group of people with sim-
ilar interests,” Tice said. “The 
general joke of the Internet now 

is ‘Rule 34: if it exists, there is a porn for 
it’ but now it’s like ‘if it exists, there is a 
fandom for it.’” 

Tice also reads fan fiction that is 
related to Harry Potter — a common 
activity within a fandom. Fan fiction 
is literature written by amateur writers 
about characters from their favorite 
movies, books, television shows and 
games. This breed of fan club is very 
popular on the Internet with over 100 
Web sites focused on just Harry Potter 
fan fiction alone. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College fresh-
man Justine Yang participates in 
Transformers fandom and dabbles in 
various others. As one of the officers 
of Darkstar, a science fiction and gam-
ing club at UCSD that was formed in 
1978, Yang said fandoms come from 
the popular culture of TV and video 
games that children are exposed to at 
a young age

For Yang, that TV show was 
Godzilla, which prompted 
her to write a 42-page 
story and surf every 
other show on 

FoxKids.
“I don’t know what it is about fan-

doms,” she said. “But they pique my 
interests through various means like 
style, story, characters and sheer cre-
ativity.”

While many people close a book  
or see a show or movie they like and 
move on, fandomers are unable to put 
something they like to rest, Tice said, 
translating to looking it up online, 
then reading summaries, interviews, 
reviews, then eventually fan fiction.

Like many others, Yang reads and 
writes fan fiction because she likes 
to express her creativity through this 
medium and find people with similar 
interests.

“What I like about fandoms is that 
I don’t feel like the only freak in this 
world,” she said. “I can talk freely with 
people who have the same interests as 
me that I can’t with ‘normal’ people, 
whatever the hell ‘normal’ means.”

As a way to showcase many people’s 
popular culture obsessions, Fanfiction.

had come across a whale. A young 
Japanese man was the first to spot it, 
shouting what I presume might mean, 
“I see a whale and am quite excited 
about it!” The group rushed to the 
right rail of the boat, making her tilt 
slightly to that side. Despite the crush 
of onlookers and the boat’s jarring 
rhythm, I shot a few frames of what 
was probably a male gray whale as its 
tail lifted out of the water, signifying 
that it had taken enough breaths and 
was headed back down to the depths. 
Its distance from the boat was so great 
that even though its body could have 
been 45 feet long, its flukes were only a 
small black mark in my photographs. 
But it was what I came for, and even 
though the whale was only visible for 
a few seconds, I had gotten my shot 
and was satisfied. I wondered what 
the journey could possibly mean to 
the other people on the boat, with no 
photo to take and only a memory to 
bring back to the harbor.

I looked at my cell phone to see 
what time it was. We still had an hour 
out at sea. A sea lion was tagging along 
with the boat, making turns under the 
hull and coming up on either side. 
With it were a pelican and a cormo-
rant, waiting for a few morsels to fall 

overboard. 
For the moment, I wasn’t bothered 

by the human intrusion into the natu-
ral environment that brought these 
animals together, and passed the time 
by taking pictures of the unnatural 
trio.

We saw a couple more whales that 
afternoon, but for me the magic was 
lost after the first sighting; I didn’t get 
any good photos of the later whales 
anyway. When we made land I took 

account of the soreness in my legs and 
feet from keeping myself steady for 
hours on end. I licked my lips, felt my 
salty sunburned skin and tried to pat 
down my wind-blown hair. I was tired. 
It was all worth it, though, even just 
for those few moments when I saw the 
tail of a whale.

faced some uncertainty due to the lack 
of an approved budget,” said Seaver. 
“We also are undergoing some work-
force restructuring, which will include 
a voluntary buyout.”

The layoffs, combined with the 
change in management, may have also 
affected LLNL’s ability to attract and 
keep new researchers. According to 
Hugh Gusterson, a nuclear weapons 
analyst quoted in Betsy Mason’s Dec. 
9 article in the Contra Costa Times, 
“Almost everyone I ever interviewed 
at Livermore or Los Alamos National 
Laboratory told me that it was very 
important to them to say they work for 
the University of California, not just a 
bomb factory. There’s prestige in it.”

York agreed, saying that many sci-
entists see the UC system as a superior 
employer.

“That changes day to day and year 
to year, but by and large, the University 
of California is regarded, by new young 
scientists coming out of school, as a 
great place to work for,” York said.

Anonymous LLNL employees have 
been posting their criticisms of the 
new changes on the blog, “LLNL: The 
True Story” since early December, and, 
according to Mason’s article, the num-
ber of scientists and engineers leaving 
LLNL has increased continuously, from 
141 in 2002 to 278 in 2007. 

Questions also linger as to why the 
regents voted to remain part of the labs’ 
managerial companies at all, given their 
poor track record in 2003 and a distinct 
lack of sizable benefits.

“The main benefit we’ve gotten for 
all these many years is a very small fee, 
which we’ve then used for other pur-
poses relating to international security,” 
York said. “However, it’s a rather small 
benefit. I mean, the laboratories have 
several billion dollars and that’s a few 
tens of million. So we’re talking about 1 
percent or something like that.”

York also believes that the UC sys-
tem primarily chose to continue its 
relationship with the weapons labs 
based on the long-standing history 
between them. 

“The natural thing is to continue 
the path unless there’s a good reason 
not to. It’s the way people are, people 
behave. It’s just inertia and familiarity, 
and I would say also, that’s what the 
staff would like.”

In their decision to maintain 
relations with the labs, the regents 
have also ignored demands from 
activist groups such as the Coalition 
to Demilitarize the UC, which seeks 
to end the university-lab relation-
ship on the grounds that an institu-
tion of higher education should not 
be associated with the development 
of nuclear weapons.

“There’s something to that,” York 
said. “It is something outside the 
normal purposes of a higher educa-
tion institution, and it does divert 
attention from other things. [If] I 
were king, or something like that, 
I would cut it off … that’s been my 
position at least for the last 10 years, 
since the end of the Cold War. 
But once you leave the university, 
nobody cares — it doesn’t make any 
difference at all.”

Ultimately, York maintained, the 
UC system’s reduced involvement 
in lab management will not have 
any great effect. 

“I think it’s a step in the wrong 
direction, done for the wrong rea-
sons, but it doesn’t make much dif-
ference,” he said. “The new manage-
ment is competent, and the people 
who are already there will make 
the transition and it’ll be basically 
smooth. It may have some glitches 
… but this will all pass.”

movies, authors, and videogames, 
ranging from the more popular 
“Harry Potter” or “Lord of the Rings,” 
to “Of Mice and Men.”

While there are millions of fans 
on the Internet, whenever Eleanor 
Roosevelt College freshman Charlotte 
Harland finds out that a friend of hers 
dabbles in fandom, she said it is like 
an automatic fellowship. 

“I was actually surprised to find 
that a bunch of my suitemates are fan 
fiction junkies, too,” she said. “It’s like 

‘ooh, yay, someone who won’t edge 
slowly away from me if I start talking 
about such-and-such pairing or alter-
nate universes or something.”

Yang said that although many of 
her friends know that she is interested 
in fandoms, she tries to express her 
obsession minimally to avoid alien-
ating them. Although some people 
don’t understand the lives of fando-
mers, their intense fascination with 
fiction is what makes them different.

“It doesn’t help that my dorm 
keys include keychains of Bumblebee 

and Optimus Prime,” Yang said. “A 
handful of my friends are similarly 
interested in one or two of my fan-
doms, but they’re not as devoted or 
obsessive as I am. That’s what sets me 
apart; I sometimes overreact to cer-
tain things, like crappy, poorly writ-
ten fan fiction. That’s the main differ-
ence between me and them — I have 
too much of an emotional attachment 
to these fandoms.”

half of the game. The Bruins tied up 
the game late and the two teams traded 
leads until Houseman and Hardy gave 
UCSD a 28-26 lead. UCLA responded 
with a four-point run coming out of a 
timeout to steal the game.

Game three was very similar, with 
the teams tied late at 25, but the Bruins 
scored five of the next six to take the 
match.

Ring said he wasn’t very disappoint-
ed with the way the team performed at 
UCLA and admitted that it was an off 
night for both squads.

“They didn’t play that great and we 
didn’t play that great,” he said. “Out 
of the three games, we gave ourselves 
opportunities in two of them and we 
just weren’t able capitalize. It’s a learn-
ing experience for us.” 

The road doesn’t get any easier for 
the Tritons in MPSF play as they’ll fly to 
Honolulu for a pair of contests against 
No. 12 Hawaii on Jan. 23 and Jan. 25, 
where crowds are expected to reach the 
thousands, according to Spangler.

Readers can contact Matt Croskey at 
mcroskey@ucsd.edu.

they’re that wide open, but it was a 
good play and it worked out in our 
favor.”

The Broncos were unable to con-
nect on two three-point chances before 
the buzzer as the Tritons held on for 
the close win in front of a season-high 
1,209 fans. 

Kim again led the Tritons in scoring 
with 12 points, while junior forward 
Shane Poppen had eight points and a 
game-high eight rebounds.

The Tritons, now at the halfway 
point of the regular season, have a 
chance to tie and even surpass their 
10-win total from last season against 
another pair of CCAA opponents this 
weekend. UCSD faces San Francisco 
State on Jan. 25 and Cal State Monterey 
Bay on Jan. 26, with both games sched-
uled for 7:30 p.m. tip-off at RIMAC

point shot to give the Tritons a five-
point lead. UCSD closed out the half 
on a high note with key scores from 
junior forward Michelle Osier and a 
three-point basket from senior guard 
Alexis Mezzetta to take a 34-26 lead 
going into halftime.

Noud opened up the second half 
with another three-pointer to extend 
the UCSD lead to double digits. The 
Coyotes stormed back, using hot shoot-
ing from the three-point line as well as 
in the paint to take a 40-39 lead with 
12:43 left in the game. The Tritons took 
back the lead on free throw shots from 
Osier, and held on from there, eventu-
ally extending their lead and finishing 
with a 68-60 win over the Coyotes.

UCSD handed Cal State San 
Bernardino its second conference 
loss, moving to one game behind the 
Coyotes in the CCAA standings. Much 
of the Coyotes’ success this season can 
be attributed to the conference’s scor-
ing leader, forward Vanessa Wilt, who 
averages a conference-high 21 points 
per game. Although Wilt pulled down 
14 rebounds in the contest, UCSD’s 
defense managed to hold her to just 
10 points.

“We don’t have one player on our 
team that can stop her once she touch-
es the ball,” Noud said. Therefore, the 
Tritons relied on team defense to con-
tain Wilt and limit her shot attempts, 
according to Noud.

 “We tried to keep her from touch-
ing the ball because if she gets the ball, 
she’s probably going to score,” head 
coach Charity Elliott said. “We played 
good post defense and had good weak-
side help.”

UCSD had four players score in 
double figures in the game, with Noud 
recording 21 points for the Tritons. 
Osier had 14 points, Mezzetta scored 
13 points and senior center Diahnn 
Futalan added 11 points for the Tritons 
in her first career start. 

The win over Cal State San 
Bernardino came after a tough loss to 
Cal Poly Pomona the night before. The 
unranked Broncos came out strong 
against the Tritons, taking an early 10-
4 lead. Noud’s three-point shot cut Cal 
Poly Pomona’s lead to 10-7 with 12:38 
left in the first half but the Tritons 
started to slip after that. Down 32-22 
with 17 seconds left in the first half of 
the game, Mezzetta made a three-point 
basket to cut the Broncos’ lead to seven 
going into the break.

The Tritons started off the scoring 
in the second half with two straight 
baskets from sophomore forward Erin 
Noonan to cut the Broncos lead to 
four. The Broncos continued their 
strong play, holding onto the lead until 
a pull-up jumper from senior center 
Alexis Gaskin gave the Tritons a 44-43 
with 11:54 remaining in the game.

Cal Poly regained the lead with 2:18 
left, forcing the Tritons to catch up to 

the Broncos late in the game. With 22 
seconds left in regulation, Osier made 
a lay-up to cut the Broncos’ lead to 
62-61. The Broncos made good on two 
ensuing free throws and the Tritons 
missed a three-point shot attempt that 
would have tied the game, leaving Cal 
Poly Pomona with a 66-61 win.

The Broncos sealed their upset win 
largely because of their strong start 
to the game that left the Tritons in a 
seven-point hole at halftime.

“For some reason, we played back 
on our heels to start the game,” Elliott 
said. “We were timid and hesitant and 
that gave [the Broncos] confidence.”

Despite the loss, Osier posted 
impressive numbers in the game, lead-
ing the Tritons with 17 points and 19 
rebounds.  

The Tritons will return to action 
on Jan. 25 against San Francisco State 
as part of UCSD’s Spirit Night before 
hosting Cal State Monterey Bay on 
Jan. 26. 

“Anytime we’re at home we need 
to take care of business,” Elliott said. 
“Every game so far has been a dogfight, 
and I expect the same next weekend.”

With both of UCSD’s upcoming 
opponents having losing records, the 
Tritons will have an opportunity to 
move up from fourth place in the 
CCAA standings.

HOT CORNER

TUESDAY, JANUARY 22, 2008

By Matt Croskey 
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — It was only 
a matter of time before the UCSD 
men’s volleyball team broke through in 
conference play. After suffering three 
straight losses to ranked opponents, 
the Tritons earned their first victory 
in the tough Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation on Jan. 19, knocking off 
Division I defending national cham-
pions UC Irvine 30-25, 30-22, 31-33, 
34-32.

The win marked the program’s first 
victory over the Anteaters since 2004, 
and it couldn’t have come at a better 
time. The Tritons suffered three tough 
losses to open up conference play but 
were contenders in each game, and 
wins could have been within reach if a 
few balls bounced their way.

Sophomore outside hitter Jason 
Spangler spoke on the team’s behalf 
about how important the victory was. 

“We were all excited to finally get 
that win,” he said. “We gained some 
confidence finally seeing just how well 
we can play when we cut down on our 
errors. Overall, it was a well-deserved 
win.”

Head coach Kevin Ring echoed 
Spangler’s comments, saying that his 
players had come close in previous 
matches, but that they finally clicked 
against UCI because the Tritons fin-
ished the plays when they needed to.

“We really haven’t been taking 
advantage of our opportunities,” he 
said. “During practice we’ve concen-
trated on improving our first-swing 
percentages and against Irvine we were 

quite efficient. We closed out games 
very well. It was really a combination of 
things that did it, but Phil [Bannan] did 
a great job of feeding the hot hitters and 
taking advantage of our matchups with 
shorter blockers on the outside.” 

Falling behind early in game one, 
freshman setter Bannan got the Tritons’ 
engines revved up with back-to-back 
aces to tie the game at 16. The lead 
opened up to three at 25-22 after an ace 
by sophomore libero Erik Sierks. The 
Anteaters closed within one, but fresh-
man middle blocker Gerald Houseman 
slammed down two kills en route to a 
Triton game one victory.

The momentum carried into game 
two, with UCSD opening an 18-12 lead 
and cruising to an eight-point win. 

Senior outside hitter Russ Hardy 
tallied a pair of kills and aces to put the 
Tritons in position for a three-game 
sweep, 26-22.

But what has become a theme for 
the Tritons all season proved to be their 
Achilles heel yet again, as they squan-
dered another late-game lead to give 
the defending champions a comeback 
opening. 

Despite the loss in game three, 
Spangler was pleased with how quickly 
the team responded.

“Having a team come back is some-
thing very hard to cope with,” he said. 
“It can be devastating, but for the first 
time we didn’t look back. We just kept 
thinking about the next point and the 
next game.” 

Despite seeing their late-game lead 
evaporate in game three, the Tritons 
maintained their mental sharpness and 
showed their composure in games one 

and two, jumping out to an early 4-1 
lead. UCSD held onto its three-point 
advantage until UC Irvine went on an 
8-1 run to take a 25-21 lead. 

Not to be outdone, the Tritons 
used a small run to tie the game at 25 
and the two teams traded points until 
UCSD earned its first match point. The 
Anteaters staved off the loss and man-
aged a game point of its own before 
Hardy recorded two kills around a 
Houseman ace to take the match.

Hardy finished with a career-high 
24 kills and didn’t seem to show any 
signs of rust after his year-long hiatus 
studying abroad.

“Russ has had an impact on this 
team since the beginning,” Ring said. 
“He’s gotten better each game in his 
hitting and his legs are getting accus-
tomed to the everyday jumping. The 
improvements are carrying over into 
each match and you’re seeing that in 
his stats.”

The win helped heal the wounds 
from a 30-21, 30-28, 30-26 sweep by 
No. 4 UCLA over the Tritons on Jan. 
17. UCSD held leads late in games two 
and three but was  unable to capitalize 
in both instances.

With nothing positive to dwell on in 
the opening game, the Tritons showed 
signs of life in game two, holding a 
three-point lead throughout the better

No. 20 UCSD Splits 
League Contests

By Janani Sridharan
Senior Staff Writer

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
No. 20 UCSD women’s basketball 
team returned home from a four-
game road trip to mixed results 
in two tightly contested games at 
RIMAC Arena. The Tritons split their 
games over the weekend, losing the 
first against Cal Poly Pomona by a 
score of 66-61 on Jan. 18 before post-
ing a 68-60 victory over Cal State 
San Bernardino on Jan. 19. The 

Tritons remain in fourth place in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association with a conference record 
of 5-3 and an overall record of 13-5.

After suffering a loss in a close 
game to Cal Poly Pomona, the 
Tritons found themselves in another 
close contest against Cal State San 
Bernardino. The Coyotes came out 
swinging, taking a 10-2 lead over the 
Tritons three minutes into the game. 
But UCSD battled back and took a 
15-14 lead on two free throws from 
sophomore guard Annette Ilg.

The Tritons and Coyotes went 
back and forth for much of the first 
half, with both teams active on the 
defensive end. With 5:12 left in the 
first half and UCSD up 20-18, senior 
forward Meaghan Noud hit a three-

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The Tritons 
returned home this weekend and con-
tinued a season-long trend, defeating 
Cal Poly Pomona on Jan. 18, 55-52, and 
No. 5 Cal State San Bernardino by a 
76-65 final score on Jan. 19 to improve 
their home record to a perfect 7-0. 
Overall, UCSD now stands at 9-4 and 
has improved to 6-2 in the ultra-com-
petitive California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, good enough for a second-
place tie in conference standings.

The Tritons battled with Cal State 
San Bernardino throughout most of 
the first half with five ties and five 
lead changes nearly three-quarters of 
the way through the opening period. 
However, UCSD closed the half strong, 
holding the Coyotes to just one field 
goal while forcing six turnovers in the 
final six minutes of the half. Junior 
forward Darryl Lawlor’s lay-up right 
before the buzzer gave UCSD an eight-
point cushion heading into intermis-
sion. While Cal State San Bernardino 
converted 54.5 percent of their field-
goal attempts in the first half, the 
Tritons fared even better, with a 61.9 
field-goal shooting percentage.

“We knew this was a great team we 
were coming up against and we knew 
it was going to be a total team effort if 
we were going to come out victorious,” 
junior guard Alan Husted said.

The second half began like the 
first ended, this time with junior for-
ward Henry Patterson’s lay-up opening 
UCSD’s scoring and giving the Tritons 
a double-digit advantage. The Coyotes 
proved their season-long high rank-
ing, putting together a 13-2 run over 

the next three-and-a-half minutes and 
retaking the lead at 41-40. But UCSD 
did not back down after Cal State San 
Bernardino’s surge, with Lawlor con-
necting on a three off an assist from 
senior guard Clint Allard. The Tritons 
would not trail the rest of the game. 
While the Coyotes climbed within one 
possession on three occasions during 
the final eight minutes of the half, 
UCSD came up with big stops and big 
shots. Three-pointers by Lawlor and 
sophomore guard Jordan Lawley and 
two lay-ups from Patterson put the 
Tritons ahead by as much as 13 enter-
ing the final minute of the upset win.

“Coach has been stressing ‘respect 
everyone, fear no one,’ and tonight that 
really hit home,” Patterson said. “Down 
the stretch we just pulled away; killer 
instinct kicked in finally.”

UCSD continued to demonstrate its 
improved offense, converting 66.7 per-
cent of its field-goal attempts — 61.1 
percent from three-point range — as 
they missed only five of 18 shots in 
second half. Lawley joined Patterson in 
scoring double-digits for UCSD with 
13 points, while Clint Allard had nine 
points, a game-high eight assists and 
four rebounds. Junior guard Kelvin 
Kim was the leading Triton scorer of 
the evening with 16 points, converting 
4-of-5 shots, all from three-point range, 
while playing with a dislocated thumb.

“Our athletic trainer Kevin Messey 
did a great job of taking care of me,” 
Kim said. “I did some therapy on it, 
got it taped up, and it felt fine today. I 
thought the tape was going to hinder 
me, but during the game I wasn’t think-
ing about it. I’ll be taping my finger 
every game from now on.”

The Tritons did not find the same 
offensive efficiency early on against Cal 
Poly Pomona on Jan. 18. After opening 
the game with a Lawlor lay-up off of an 
Allard assist, the Tritons would score 
only five more points during the next 
12 minutes of the game, going score-
less for a nearly four-and-a-half-minute 
stretch from the 12-minute mark until 

7:36 was left in the half. Despite being 
down 12 and struggling to score, head 
coach Chris Carlson was able to get the 
best out of his club to close the half. 
UCSD turned the tide by returning the 
favor on the defensive end, holding the 
Broncos to an over four-and-a-half-
minute scor-
ing drought. 
The Tritons 
also found 
their offensive 
rhythm, near-
ly tripling their output from the first 
12 minutes during the final seven-and-
a-half. UCSD closed the half on a 20-4 
run, getting firepower off three-point-
ers by Husted, Lawley and Kim, and 
went into the break up 27-23.

The Broncos tied the game at 15:29 
in the second half as the teams found 
themselves tied on three occasions and 
traded the lead seven times in a seven-
minute stretch. Husted again stepped 
up in a big way off the bench, nailing 
back-to-back three-pointers off Lawley 
passes that helped the Tritons to retake 
and then extend their lead to four.

“Coach has a lot of confidence in 
me [and] tells me to shoot the ball,” 
said Husted, who scored 11 points on 
a perfect 4-for-4 shooting night. “With 
the shots there, I was just trying to 
do whatever I can do to help us out. 
Fortunately they went in at good times 
in the game.”

Despite having a lead, the game was 
contested until the final buzzer, with 
UCSD never building more than a five-
point advantage. The Broncos had a 
chance to tie the game at the free-throw 
line with 2:19 remaining, but Donnelle 
Booker connected on only one of two. 
Neither team scored again until Lawlor 
found Patterson for a wide-open lay-up 
with 20 seconds remaining. 

“I was trying to get open all game 
and then the most crucial play of the 
game I was wide open,” Patterson said. 
“Usually people miss lay-ups when 

UCSD holds perfect 7-0 
record in home games 
and moves up to second 
place in league play after 
two tough wins.
