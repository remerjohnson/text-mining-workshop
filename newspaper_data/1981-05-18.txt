Do the times ever 
change in the US? 
Seven years after Vietnam ends, 
rally ties old and new wars 
Come Senator and Congressman 
Please heed the call 
Don 't stand in the doorway 
And don't block up the hall 
And dott't speak too soon 
For the wheel's still in spin 
There's a battle outside and it's ragin' 
It will soon shake your windows 
And rattle your walls 
For the times they are a' changin " 
Bob Dylan - The Times They 
Are a' Changin' 

BY PAUL FARWELL 
taft Write r 

The lyric to this famou Dylan 
song, sung by the female duo of 
Woman ong at Friday' noon rally 
Remembering Vietnam gave many a 
chance to reflect on whether the time 
really have changed. 

The rally , an un-no talgic look back 
at the Vietnam era in light of the US 
intervention in EI Salvador, focu ed 
on several individual who" hook the 
window "of American in titutions in 
the sixtie and early even ties. 

Two of them were Anthony]. Rus 0 
and George T. Winne. 

Rus 0, who spoke at the rally, i 
best remembered as a re earch 
analyst for the Rand Corporation (a 
highly funded governmental think 

. tank for defense) who betrayed the 
"system') by helping Dr. Daniel 
Elsberg leak the Pentagon Papers to 
the press, 

protest of the Vietnam War. 
Said Ru 0 about the ixtie : "That 

(anti-war) movement became so 
trong that it totally freaked out the 

Pentagon, the CIA, the Bankers, and 
those kind of peoples. It freaked them 
out so bad that they have spent the 
best part of the last five of ix years in 
an- intense campaign of disinforma-
tion. They are very much afraid of 
truth and true patriots, Winne was a 
true patriot because he wa willing to 
sacrifice himself for a better future." 

When asked after the rally whether 
anything today is analogou to the 
Pentagon Paper ,Ru 0 commented, 
"There are ecrets in today's 
government that need to be exposed . 
(But) we still need to review the 
Pentagon Paper ." 

The Pentagon Paper ,leaked in the 
early eventie to Neil Sheehan (a New 
York Times staff writer), contained 
confidential defense department 
memo on American involvement in 
Vietnam. The use of the highly toxic 
defoliant , " agent orange," for 
in tance, is de cribed in detail in 
several ection of the paper . 

In a seminar after the rally on the 
effects of bombing on outheast Asia, 
Ru so gave an in ide account of how 
'he and Elsberg leaked the papers . 

Anthony J. Russo (above), bel'lt-known for his role in leaking the Pentagon 
Papers to the press, spoke at Friday's noon " Remembering Vietnam" rally 
on Revelle Plaza. The rally was dedicated. to George Winne, a student who 
burned himself to death on the Plaza in 1970 in protest of the Vietnam War. 

Winne, to whom the entire rally 
was dedicated , was a UCSD student 
who burned himself to death on 
Revelle Plaza on May 10, 1970 in 

EI berg kept the paper in a safe at 
his office in the daytime. At night he 
would stuff as many a possible in his 
briefca e and bring them to Ru so's 
office where the two would spend the 
night xeroxing them. According to

Brown urges UC to drop 
lab ties; Regents ask how 

BY KATHY HUFFER 
Editor 

LOS ANGELES-Charging the 
University of California with a "correlative 
duty" to discourage nuclear warfare, Gov. 
Brown called Friday for the creation of a UC 
"global peace" research center. 

Brown told a packed Regents ' meeting 
that, because of its management of two 
nuclear labs, the University has "a moral 
obligation and an intellectual obligation to 
make a correspondin~ commitment to 
promoting global peace. ' 

His plan met with enthusiastic applause 
and a standing ovation from a group of over 
125 UC student who attended the meeting, 
some of whom came from as far away as 
Berkeley. 

However, critics, as alway , said the 
Governor was engaging in pointless 
rhetoric, and challenged him to offer more 
specific plans. 

"He (Brown) is in a position to make a 
specific propo al," Regent Stanley 
Sheinbaum said during the meeting. "I 
sympathize with what he ha said, but thus 
far it is all rhetoric." 

Brown, probably a candidate for one of 
California's two Senate eat, denied the 

. charge, but could not elaborate on hi plan . 
He did say, however, that uch a center 
justified the allocation of "a ignificant sum 
of money" and suggested that he might a k 
the State Legi lature to fund the center. 

Meanwhile, th Regent voted to 
postpone for a month their deci ion on 
whether to renew for another five year 
UC' contract with the Department of 
Energy (DOE). 

The DOE is re pon ible for financing 
UC's management of the Lo Alamos and 
Livermore laboratorie , which have 
designed virtually all of the United States' 
nuclear weapons. 

The Regents were originally scheduled to 
vote on the contract at their October 
meeting, but the vote was rescheduled on 
short notice for last week' meeting. The 
change prompted protests from UC 
student throughout the state, and re ulted 
in the arrest of 25 UC Santa Barbara 
student protestors la t week. 

However, the Regent voted to po tpone a 
deci ion on the contract until it June 
meeting, in order to conduct a public 
hearing. 

UC President David Saxon told everal 
reporter after the meeting that he believed 
the large student turnout did not pr.e ure 
the Regent into po tponing their deci ion. 

Saxon would not discu Brown' 
re earch center propo al but called it "an 
idea, one that I'm very ympathetic to." 

Brown told reporters after the meeting 
that hi advocacy of a global peace center 
did not change hi oppo ition to VC' 
management of the two nu lear labs. 

''I'm going to work ery hard with the 
Univer ity ... on weapon control and on 
global peace," he commented. 

tudent Lobby Co-dir tor Marty Kuzak 
id Brown' proposal wa "excellent" and 

would not minimiz effort to div t UC 
from nucl ar rear h .

Harris' incompetence 
sparks ,new slate 
Editor: 

I was appalled at the recent 
financial incompetency 
displayed by our AS 
President losh Harri (ic) 
and his ubsequent disquali-
fication (which he attributed 
to the AS by saying the 
election "wasn't the mo t 
professionally run "). 

Therefore, I hereby 
announce my candidacy for 
AS President in 1982. 1 will be 
running on the "Let's Get 
Our Shit Together" s late. 

1 realize that this 
announcement is a bit 
premature, but J figure this 
will give enough time to 
'unprofessionaJs ' to classify 
and file my campaign. It will 

also give me time to get 'in' 
with the people who really 
decide the election. In light of 
thi fact my fir t campaign 
promise is as follows: in the 
next 11 month of my que t 
for the presidency, I promise 
to turn in all receipts on time 
and not spend over my alloted 
$50 while on the campaign 
trail (which will include a 
four-college whistle stop tour 
on the 'Togetheme sTrain' 
scheduled next spring). 

In keeping with my pledge I 
hope to bring credibility to 
my personal campaign and to 
hopefully keep an 'unprofes· 
sional' organization from the 
embarrasing necessity of 
choosing our AS president.

Sexual security 
available now 
Editor: 

Derek Whipple's response 
to Ronni B. ~.~ht's letter on 
sexuality In turmoil 
(Guardian, May 14), neglects 
a few very important points. 
The first is that although 
sexuality is in turmoil it br. 
no means is in a whirlpoo . 
That is to say, there is not a 
prevalent tendency for people 
to flush notions of sexual 
identity down the proverbial 
toilet. Secondly, Mr. Whipple 
may not be aware of a new 
program started experiment· 
allr in Iowa in the mid-1950's. 
Al children born in Iowa 

, since 1954 have been issued a 
sexual identity" card. On this 
card is listed their sex and 
assigned sexual preference: 3 
percent lesbian, 7 percent 
male homosexual, 25 percent 
bisexual , 65 percent 
heterosexual. 

After the age of 21 children 
(now adults) are able to trade ' 
their cards if they wish. No 
person can have more than 
one card and anyone caught 
violating the terms of their 
card is castrated. The system 
has been very successful and 
surveys taken in the 
Davenport area reveal a 
marked drop in frustration 
caused by sexual insecurity. 

Third, state senate bill (SB 
679) will make sexual 
insecurity illegal. So people 
are well aware of the 
problem. Both Whipple and 
Light will be glad to learn 
that sexual security will be 
achieved in our time. I think 
the public owes both Whipple 
and Light untold gratitude 
and t hanks for bringing such 
noteworthy concerns to the 
attention of UCSD students.

Word from the chair 
Editor: 

Just a note to set the record 
straight. 

The Search Committee for 
the VCUA has invited six 
candidates to campus for 
interview. There may yet be 
more. Clearly, then, these six 
are not finalists, and no rank· 
ordering is possible at this 

time. 
. We value input from all 
interviewers, and hope that ' 
many of your readers will be 
able to attend the open

Despite Reagan, solar energy 
is popular with utilit.ies 

BY WESLEY MARX 
Despite the Reagan 

Administration 's clear tilt 
toward the "hard energy" 
path of nuclear and fossil 
fuels, a growing number of 
utility companies around the 
nation are opting for 
increased reliance on solar 
power and conservation to 
meet future energy needs. 

The trend appears to result 
from a combination of two 
factors: the rising costs and 
lengthy delays of implement· 
ing new nuclear or fossil fuel 
power plants, and the 
demonstrated ability of 
small , individual solar 
heating units to significantly 
reduce demands for gas and 
electricity. 

Already . the increased 
commitment to solar power 
in CaHfornia has elimmated 
the need for the proposed 
giant, $5 billion Allen· 
Warner Bailey Energy 
System, which was supposed 
to transfer energy generated 
in coal· fired plants in Utah 
and Nevada to Southern 
California_ The two Califor-
nia utilities that originally 
promoted the project have 
since reassessed their future 
energy needs and concluded 
that the money will be better 
spent in conservation and 
renewable energy invest· 
ments. 

In California, the benefits 
of solar power were first 
demonstrated by a municipal 
utility in Santa Clara. In a 
program that began after the 
first oil shortage in 1973, the 
city utility began purchasing, 
installing and servicing 
residential solar systems. 

The Santa Clara utility has 
become, in effect, a municipal 
solar utility responsible for 
capital costs and consumer 
security. The city's utility 
reserve fu nd is used to 
purchase solar pool and 
water heaters. The city can 
get a lower unit price by 
buying in bulk. It then leases 
the systems to residents who 
pay a monthly lease rate that 
IS 20 to 30 percent lower than 
the equivalent cost of natural 
gas. The rate, covering the 
fixed cost of the solar 
equipment, is not subject to 

. 

Wesley Man. author of 
tllr~ books on energy and the 
enviro"me;,t, wrote this 
article for tlu Pacific News 
Service. 

the frequent rate hikes that 
gas and electricity users 
must endure. A service 
connect ion fee of $300 and the 
lease payment are both 
elegible for state and federal 
tax credit . 

Robin Saunders, the city's 
solar utility engineer, 
estimates that solar systems 
installed to date save up to 
the equivalent of 5,000 
barrels of oil annually. While 
the figure is modest , it does 
not include the savings that 
result from not having to pay 
the costs of meeting air 
quality standards, nuclear 
waste disposal. earthquake 
design standards or the next 
oil em bargo. 

Such prospects impressed 
a major utility halfway 
.across the nation. An original 
example of the big-dam, big 
power plant mindset, the 
Tennessee Valley Authority 
is now a pioneer in the 
renewable enery push. Under 
a $54 million residential 
energy conservation pro-
gram, TVA provides both low 
interest and zero interest 
loans for residential solar 
collectors and even wood 
heaters in rural areas . ,TVA 
expects Nashville eventually 
to have more solar heaters 
per capita than California's 
San Diego County, which 
mandates solar hot water 
systems in new residential 
tracts. TVA has also 
designed and placed 130 
passive solar modular homes 
in the Tennessee Valley. 

Not'to be outdone by TVA, 
California is now s hifting to 
renewable sources at both 
the small and lar~e utility 
levels. The Califorma Energy 
Commission has helped fund 
an action program for 16 
more communities to form 
variant on Santa Clara's 
municipal solar utility 
concept. according to Barry 
Saitman of the commission. 
Palo Alto has a $650,000 
program of low interest (eight 
percent) loans for home solar 
system. Loan repayments go 
into a revolving fund to pay 
for new system . Palo Alto 
trains students to weatherize 
homes for an average $45 fee. 
The city even works to insure 
that no restrictions are 
imposed against that 
ultimate solar dryer, the 
backyard clothesline. 

The 'California Public 
Utili tie Commission has 

also mandated the state's 
four largest investor·owned 
utilitie to fund on-site solar 
systems. The program will 
reach 375,000 residential 
customers when implement· 
ed , and save the equivalent of 
one million barrels of oil a 
year. Net savings will 
amoun t to $433 million over a 

2~year period. The utilities 
are offering homeowners 
either a cash rebate or a low 
interest loan. Idaho's PubliC' 
Utilities Commission has 
mandated a similar program. 

Pacific Gas and Electric, 
California's largest utility, 
has seen its growth rate for 
energy demand drop from 
five to seven percent 
annually prior to the 1973 oil 
embargo, to just two percent 
now. The utility has deferred 
plans for anot her coal 
burning plant in Solano 
County, and now expects to 
generate 43 percent of its 
power from renewable 
sources by 1991. according to 
spokesperson Faith Rock-
maker. 

Hawaii . which spends 
some $800 million each year 
to import oil, is also moving 
aggressively toward renew-
able energy solutions. The 
Hawaiian Electric Company 
is aiming for total electrical 
energy self-sufficiency by 
1990. The utility is currently 
generatin~ some power from 
the burnm~ of sugar cane 
waste, and It has contracted 
with a San Francisco firm to 
install a number of wind 
machines. The same firm, 
Windfarm Ltd ., is installing 
51 wind machines in 
northern California to supply 
power to PG&E. 

In the Northwest , the 
Bonneville Power Admini· 
stration, a federal institu.: 
tion, supplies hydroelecttic 
power wholesale to utilites in 
Oregon , Washington, Idaho 
and western Montana . 
Running out of good dam 
sites and eager to avoid a 
costly reliance on oil or coal. 
the administration, with 
Congres 's blessing, is 
helping to fund residential 
solar systems. According to 
Wayne Hart. BPA energy 
conservation specialist, the 
administration will , contri· 
bute $700 towards the cost of 
a residential contractor· 
installed solar water heating 
system.

Do the tintes ever

DOGIBIBDBY 
continued from page 1 
Russo, it took a year before all 
the papers could be copied. 

Wayne Dick, a graduate 
student at UCSD who was an 
active protester in the sixties, 
spoke about George Winne. 

"This (burning) was not 
the act of an agitated student 
afraid he's not going to make 
it into Med school. This was a 
political act." Wayne said, in 
reference to the "disturbed 
young man" label applied to 
Winne by the admimstration 
at that time. . 

Winne's immolation came 
shortly alter four students 
were shot dead by national 
guardsmen at Kent State and 
while American planes were 
bombing Cambodia. Dick 
described the times as 
"intense," adding that 
"when a person ~t hit on the 
head (by a policeman) you 
could hear it from a mile 
away. It was like a home·run 
in Padre Stadium." 

Russo came out of the 
Pentagon Paper ordeal with a 
hero's image. The New York 
Times featured a picture of 
Russo walking out of prison, 
smiling, wearing his John 
Lennon style glasses, with 
his arm around co-defendant 
Elsberg. 

This quarter, several 
students associated with the 
San Diego Students for" 
Peace, the Progressive 
Coalition, and the AS are 
working toward keeping 
Winne's name alive by 
circulating a petition to place 
a memorial plaque on the 

Revelle plaza. 
Commenting about the 

futul=e of protest movements, 
Russo said, "We've got it 
(violent protest) out of our 
system. The eighties is (sic) 
going to be organization. In 
the eighties we're going to 
use the telephones and 
computers to organize this 
society and win. We don't 
need to see any more blood 
flow down the steps."

Q: Are contraceptive spermicides safe? 
A: A recent study published in theJour1wl of the American 

Medical Association (JAMA) reported an increased incidence 
of birth defects in the offsprin~ of women who filled a 
prescription for a vaginal spermiCide within 10 months prior 
to conception.

, 

• 

First, it is importan t to put into perspect ive the incidence of 
congenital (birth) defects reported in this tudy as opposed to 
the expected incidence of congenital defect s in the general 
population. Among the offspring of women who had been 
prescribed contraceptive spermicides, 2.2 percent were born 
with a major congenital malformation , whereas among those 
in a control group whose mothers did not receive a 
prescription. one percent were born with a major congenital 
malformation. 

Gllardia" pholo by P/ti/ip Davin 

Yet according to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, 
the exPected rate of major congenital malformations in the 
United States is between one percent and three percent,

Get In On Solving 
Your Own Problems 

Food .. Housins 
~soryl .. rd 

An issue of furdamental concern to most 
students is the lack of affordable houSing in 
the campus area. This San Diego campus 
currently has the highest reates for 

under~aduate housing in the u.c. system. 
Furthermore, a recent study requested by the 
Regents showed that only two campuses _ 
charged their students higher than "fair 
mar1<et value" rental rates. San Diego holds 
the dubious distinction of being one of these 
two. This means it's cheaper to live off 
campus tMn in the on campus apartments. 
Despite this fact, campus rents are once again 
skyrocketing to an all time high for the 1981 -
82 school year. Too bad rent control didn't 
passl 

We're looking for an active, icn<:>'wtedgable 
person to represent us on the Food and HeM_"" AcMIOtY 1oMt, in the hopes that 
~ can advise the Administration as to what 
kind of housing we need, and what we are 
willing to pay. A couple of promising 
alternatives we've begun to explore are 
cooperative housing and sorority/fraternity 
housing, along with the possibility of less 
"luXurious" apartments with provisions for 
smaller, Single rooms. If you'd like to get 
irM>lved and keep the ball rolling, here's a 
great opportunity!

If you'd like to take the housing struggle to 
the streets, the C.mpus/Communlty 
Plennlns CommIttee is the,place for you. 
This committee deals with issues relevant to 
the interrelation of the U.c. campus and the 
local communty. The prospect of a "student 
oriented" shopping mall was dealt with on 
this committee. We now have La Jolla Village 
Square - though we suppose some 
students can afford to shop and Bullock's 
Wilshire, and make their jewelry acquisitions 
at Black Starr & Frost...Consideration of the 
Stable lands is now of fundamental concern 
to this committee. Will the land be sold to a 
developer for the type of expensive, single 
family dwellings which now exist in the area? 
Will the money from such a sale be used to 
offset the outrageous cost of housing on this 
campus? Well, let's get your opinion. 

Prosr8 ... Review CoInm'.". 
lack of funding is a great problem not only 

for student services and activities, but for the 
campus in general as well : The needs of 
instructional research and public service 
programs, as well as supporting programs 
such as academic computing and libraries, 
must be prioritiZed in order to properly 
allocate operating budgets and capital 
improvement resources. The responsibility 
for this arduous task falls on the ".". ...

Various campus media are also funded by 

these activity fees. We currently have several

and offer students an opportOnityto publish 
creative writing and articles with critical 
insight into current events. The 
ConIWunlcationl ao.d wi II be very busy 
during these next few weeks trying to 
adequately fund our media, but the first step 
is to get the board appointed. If you have 
some kriowledge of the media, or are 
interested in learning, perhaps this is the 
position for you!

Interested in the academic side of things? 
Perhaps you can find a place on the 
Committee on Educational Policy, which 
makes recommendations to the Academic 
Senate on such matters as the incomplete 
policy or changes in the drop date for class 
withdrcr.vals. Perhaps the Executive Policy 
Committee would be best for you. This 
committee makes decisions for the 
Academic Senate when they fail to reach 
quorum (which they almost never do). 
Students have no voting ' rights on these 
committees, but with well-informed and 
articulate students in these positions, we 
cannot be ignored. At least they will know if 
we are unhappy with having to drop classes 
in the fourth week before they, the faculty, 
can get our first exam back to us. Due to the 
nature of the decisions involved, students on 
these committees are required to do a'great 
deal of research into the ·issues. The time 
commitment here can exceed ten hours per 
week, so be sure you know Vv'hat you're 
getting into ... 

If you don't have quite as much free as 
the above committees require, we 
unde/stand. We're all students here with 
masses of classes to pass. There are seldom 
any tangible rewards for participation in 
student government, academic credit being 
at the discretion 0 fthe Academic Senate, 
and stipend money being virtually non-
existant. Don't despairl You Clln still explore 
new horizons, make new friends, deal with 
new frustrations, end get a taste of the real 
'WOrld right here at UCSO! Even if you only 
have a couple of extra hours per week, you 
can become a productive member of an AS 
commission. If you're interested in working in 
any of the following areas, just contact the AS 
commissioner i~d at 452-.550, ex get 
your application up to the /'>S offices. 

Reg Fa Committe. 
Have you ever wondered what is funded 

by the fees you pay each quarter? The largest 
amount is spent on "student services" which 
include the Student Health Center, Career 
Planning and Placement, Legal Services, 
Counseling and Psychological Services, 
Recreational and Intercollegiate Athletics, 
and a variety of other programs which the 
state's legislators have deemed to be outside 
the realm of educational necessities. If the 
students want them, the students must pay 
for them. Who decides whether or not the 
students want these services? Good 
question! Surely the students make these 
decisions .. .well, not quite, but we do have 
some input. The Registration Fcc 
Committee, made up of just over half 
students, along w ith administrative and staff 
personnel, is advisory to the Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs in these matters. This 
committee is the only mechanism we have to 
ensure that our Reg Fees are spent wisely. If 
you 're interested in serving on the 
Registration Fee Committee, and can find an 
extra twelve hours per week, please apply! 

. Stud.nt C.nter Board 
The Student Center Board, make up of 

student representatives from each of the 
colleges, the AS, SAAC, the co-ops and 
enterprises, and the Graduate Student 
Council, also receives a large chunk of your 
money. They are responsible for maintenance 
of the Student Center, along with 
programming and funding for such things as 
activities at the Pub and the Che Cafe, 
equipment for co-ops and enterprises, and 
services such as EDNA. Although they are 
under the auspices of the Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs, the Student Center Board is 
one of the few committees made up solely of 
students that has actual money to work with.

opportunity to see that it's well spent!

never quite enough to go around, the

UCSD hosts Spring Classic 
Lowenbrau and surf team round-up 
the best on the West Coast 

BY BOB MCSPADDEN 
SpocU Editor 

Whoever said, "It's not 
whether you win or lose as 
long as you have fun doing 
it," might well be selected 
coordinator of this year's 
annual Lowenbrau Spring 
Classic Surfing Tournament. 

Not that Black's Beach 
won't field a number of the 
West Coast's premier surfers 
on Saturday, headed by 
Orange Coast College and 
UCSD. This is the. largest 
amateur contest 10 San. 
D' ~~ just a great ch~nce for 
everyone to go all out and 
have a really good time in the 
water," explains freshman 
Dave Hirschman. "Some of 
the top surfers and 
kneeboarders will be here to 
provide some very tough 
competition," he said. 

Each May, Lowenbrau and 
the UCSD sud team sponsor 
the Spring Classic, open to all 
college students and in past 
years, providin~ an outdoor 
arena which bnngs together 
some very long-time 
rivalries. The Tritons will 
compete as the number two 
team in California behind 
Orange Coast College, and 
this in itself will be a very 
interesting match. During 
the season OCC slid by 
UCSD in two separate meets, 
and the Tritons are looking to 
avenge their losses. 

The Triton surf team had 
an excellent season in 1980-
81, claiming a third place in 
National Intercollegiate 
competition along witlf its 
second place in California. 
Part of this outstanding 
performance is attributed to 
the skill of kneeboarder Bill 
Lerner; ranked number one 
on the National Scholastic 
Surf Association's touring 
squad. Lerner just returned 
from an international 
competition in Huntington 
Beach against surfers from 
Australia and Spain, where 
he captured first place among 
some of the world's best 
riders. Lerner is undefeated 
in his last two years of 
competition_ Triton Coach 
Mike Shand praises Lerner 
as, "kneeboarder par-
excellence. There are only 
one or two comparable on the 
whole coast." 

. Another asset to UCSD is 
the very unorthodox style of 
Craig Schreiber, ranked 
number one on the team. 
Schreiber ha spent numer-
ous retreats learning to tame 
the waves of Hawaii and 
improving his surfing. He 
earned a fourth place at this 
year' All-Cal and pegged an 
outstanding ninth place in 
the national competition. 

Also a very strong credit to 
the Triton varsity is Revelle 
junior Dave Atkin, co-captain 
of this year's squad. Atkin 

earned a tenth place at the 
All-Cal tournament and was 

amon~ fou,r members of 
UCSD s team who competed 
in Nationals_ He has been in a 
surfing rivalry with 
Hirschman dating back to the 
seventh grade, which has 
improved each surfer's 
ability tremendously. The 
title of "Mr. Enthusiasm" by 
Coach Shand compliments a 
current 4.0 grade point 
average by Atkin. 

Rounding out the attack 
for UCSD's varsity will be 
Brad Shook, Norman Garcia, 
Alex Bravo and Ron Carl. 

If the wave at Black's 
Beach break the way local 
surfers enjoy them, which I 
am told is big and scary, the 
Tritons should have an 
excellent chance to win at 
their home break. Along with 
Orange Coast College, stiff 
competition is expected from 
San Diego State, USC, UCSB 
and Pepperdine University. 

The first wave will greet 
this year's Spring Classic 
competitors at 7:00 am, and 
the last match on the slate is 
a personal dual between 
"Team Dave" (Atkin and 
Hirschman) and "Team 
Raza" (Garcia and Bravo). 
The losers will forfeit a ca e 
of brew, which will be a small 
prize in comparison to what 
Lowenbrau has planned. 

THIS WEEK IN SPORTS 
All regular season competition has been completed by UCSD's intercollegiate athletic teams 

for 1981. Teams currently in post-season tournaments are the men's and women' s crew teams

Women netters wrap-up 
season at Regionals 

BY'BOB MCSPADDEN 
sports Etlitor 

The season ended on an opponent from Sacramento 
upnote Saturday for UCSD's State a 6-3, 6-3 defeat and 
women's tennis team, which claimed UCSD's only crown. 
earned sixth place in regional - In the sixth flight Barbara 
competition. - O'Day had a very pleasant 

The Tritons were only one-
half point behind Sacramen-
to State, ',vhich claimed the 
fifth rung on the tourna-
ment 's nine team ladder. 
First place was to be 
commandeered by UC Davis, 
the number one seed entering 
Saturday's competition. 

Individually the Tritons 
faired pretty well against the 
season's perennial power-
houses. Cecilia Kavanaugh 
dropped her first match but 
came back to find herself in 
the championships of the 
consolation ' bracket. Kavan-

Cecilia Kavanaugh, number 
one seed in the regional 
competition this Saturday, 
missed quaUfying for the 
Nationals by a single match 

augh, the number one seed 
in the regionals, was upset in 
the finals by Paully Knudsen 
of UC Davis, 6-4, 6-1. 

In the second flight Laura 
Saavedra also make it to the 
final bracket in the 
con olation round, 'but was 
defeated by Biola' Malia 
Cheshire 6-0,6-1. 

Other high points in the 
competition for UCSD were 
had in Karen Barr' fourth 
flight consolation champion-
s hips. Barr handed her

improvement over last 
year's team. Hopefully 
everyone will have time to 
play on next year's team."-

surprise in defeating 
Occidental's Joann Schwartz 
7-6, 6-2. Although O'Day 10 t 
in the semi-fmals of the 
consolation match, the win 
over Schwartz became 
particularly sweet when 
Occidental 'c1aimed second 
place in the tournament.. 

In doubles competition 
Kavanaugh paired with 
Saavedra to climb into the 
championship round of the 
consolation bracket. How-
ever, victory eluded the 
Tritons - again, this time 
because of San Francisco 
State's 7-6, 3-6, 6 -3 
domination. The Tritons' 
number three doubles team 
of Barr and O'Day were al 0 
defeated in the consolation 
finals 6-2, 6-1 to Chico State' 
Gibson and Lochtfeld. 

Kavanaugh 's finish failed 
to qualify her for National 
competition, but next year 
the Tritons expect to have a 
100 percent return from this 
year's varsity squad . 

Athletic forum 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson will be present at an 

intercollegiate athletic forum at 5:00 pm in the Revelle formal-
informal lounges tommorow evening. The forum has been 
designed to help Chancellor Atkinson and others involved with

Records/ Ted Burke ' 

Musaic is 'safe' jazz, 
Withers' best ok 
Musaic - Simon and Bard 

(Flying Fish) 
Fred Simon and Michael 

Bard, a pianist and multiple 
reedman respectively who ve 
been around the jazz scene 
virtually unknown the past 
few years, here emerge from 
rela[ive obscurity with their 
first record Musaic, an effort 
that strikes me as an example 
of \ playing-it-safe: the 
melodies are pleasant and 
draw on a number of 
recognizable sources, the 
rhythm section does its 
chores competently , and the 
solos display the requisite 
knowledge of technique. But, 
the music never takes 
chances. 

Granted, the skill here is 
quite ~ood, but Simon and 
Bard s insistence on 
maintaining a· status quo -
their sources sound like an 
overly-familiar cross-
breeding of Paul Winter, 
Oregon and Bruebeck: with a 
dash of Willington thrown in 
for good measure - makes 
the stuff on Musaic merely 
run of the mill. Even Larry 
Coryell's appearance on the 
funk jam "Fancy Frog .. fail 
to liven things up. The 
usually idiosyncratic 
guitarist sounds more than 
happy to merely cruise along 
with the flow of things, 
content to only dish out cliche 
blues licks and occasional 
fast runs instead of really 
pushing himself or anyone 

for that matter. 
Bear in mind, the music is 

not atrocious. It's nice and 
would make the ideal 
backdrop for when your 
mother was over for dinner. 
Outside of that I really don't 
see any other reason for 
anyone to go out and buy this 
album. At least I wouldn't, 
but I don't have any way or 
knowing what your taste in 
organized sound is. C plus. 
Are You Conna Be the One -
Robert Gordon (RCA) 

For a number of years 
Robert Gordon has, in his 
own way, been trying to 
revive the spirit of rockabilly 
music. For all the sweat 
that's soaked his satin shirts 
because of his efforts, he's 
hardly scratched the surface 
of authenticity, let alone 
come close to the essence of 

, grease. 
The problem isn't Gor-

don's lack of vocal apparatus 
- his voice is impressively 
clear and demonstrates a 
better-than-average range -
but rather that he too 
obviously relishes the. cliches 
of his chosen form. The title 
tune "Are You Gonna Be the 
One" has him affecting a low 
voice called from one of those 
baritone backup singers, and 
"She's Not Mine" is a ballad 
wherein he offers a fragile 
Presley-like falsetto (some-
thing in Elvis's singing that 
I never liked, all corn pone 
and no guts). Obviously the 

The Guardian 

list of sylistic borrowings 
goes on, and throughout the 
album, Gordon sounds too 
exacting, with each phrase 
sounding as though he's 
practiced them through a 
tape recorder so he'd capture 
the right nuance. 

This is not the duty of an 
interpreter of a style. Though 
the comparison is tenuous, 
early rock and roll, like jazz, 
did have an element of 
spontaneity, and the magic of 
the best rockabilly was a kind 
of barely-contained craziness 
that was reflected both 
through the singer's voice 
and the near-anarchi sm of 
the band. Gordon comes 
across like a stand-up comic 
impressionist: a ' soon a the 
shock of recognit ion fades, 

Robert Gordon 

it's readily apparent that he's 
not the real thing. 

Gordon, however, does 
show promise in another 
style. "Standing on the 
Outside of Her Door" is a 
change of pace. a coutry and 
western ballad in the most 
maudlin sense. Gordon's 
voice sound comfortable for 
once, resonating, low and 
carressing as he milk every 
bit of tear-in-the-beer pathos 
from the lyrics, which are 0 
sentimentally sticky they 
drip down on you like 
stereophonic tapioca. Not 
exactly my cup of tea - I 
would like to hear someone do 
some rockabilly that didn 't 
'SOund like a rusty door hinge 
- but I might sugge t that 
Gordon shed his rolled up t-

13 

shirt and buy an outfit from 
N udies. B plus. 
Escape Artist - Garland 
Jeffreys (Epic) 

You'd think that Garland 
Jeffreys ' multiple-racial 
identity - strains of Puerto 
Rican and Afro-American 
twined with a strong 
immersion in the White 
culture of the Bronx - would 
enable him to devise a cross-
cultural rock and roll fusion 
that would unify the 
variegated elements of the 
Big Beat into an exhilirating, 
c~ent synthesis. 

Things being as they are, 
however, Jeffreys' never 
attained the heigh ts critics 
have long predicted for him, 
nor the highwater mark

Fantasia , a rarely performed

Rondo, which illustrate the 
daring harmonies and 
improvisation, characteristic

style. 

Two contrasting works of 
the Viennese school, that also 
make demands on the 
technique and imagination of 
the pianist. follow: the 
Variations Gp. 27, by Anton 
von W e bern, and the 
Wagnerian style Satiate by 
Alban Berg. 

Rose will conclude the 
program with Beethoven's

Major, a brilliant example of 
the d&ring, sublime qualities 
of the composer's last works.

teaching piano, while 
completing her Ph .D degree 
at UC San Diego. She 
performs frequently in 
chamber ensemble concerts 
as well as solo programs

Interest in new music has

aspirations he 's set for 
himself. Instead, he is a 
rather likeable sort who can 
deliver, now and again, with 
a great song and remains 
naught but an interesting 
minor talent. 

Escape Artist, his most 
recent release, suffers less 
from Jeffreys' seemingly 
habitual confusing of 
identities. His cover of the 
Mysterians old hit "96 
Tears ," is a delightfully 
tacky clone of the original 
version, with his voice 
sounding expressively sleazy 
against the farfisa organ. 
"Modern Romance" and 
"Christine" are straight 
forward as he deals with the 
problems of boy ·girl 
relationship. Some of the 

other rockers su~est the 
influences of Spnngsteen 
and Costello. Jeffreys, 
though, does again stumble 

.on his bad habits in his 
reggae numbers which sound 
as limp and washed out as 
they've ever been. His stabs 
at clarifying profundity, as in 
"Miami Beach," only tread 
the obvious polemics. 

What Jeffreys needs is a 
sense of irony, a demonstra-
tions of some kind of street-
sharpened wit that would 
reinforce his particular world 
view. Presently he seems like 
someone who tries a little too 
hard with the options in front 
of him. A little loosening of 
the music could make 
Jeffreys more comfortable 
with himself as a performer, 
and to us as listeners. B 
minus.
