Campus-Area Crime on 
the Rise, Report Says

S.M.A.R.T. Grant Restrictions 
May Affect Attainability

By Nicole Teixeira
Staff Writer

Burglaries on and around cam-
pus have almost doubled in the 
past year, amid rising crime rates 
in other areas such as motor vehicle 
theft, narcotics arrests and alcohol 
offenses, according to the annual 
campus crime report.

The Clery Campus Security 
Report is a collection of statistics 
relating to crime at UCSD and its 
surrounding areas. Although last 
year’s Clery report showed less 
reported crimes overall, the trend  
has reversed in several major areas 
this year.

In 2006, the UCSD Police 
Department, San Diego Police 
Department, campus security 
authorities and the UCSD Medical 
Center reported 113 burglaries, 
almost doubling after reaching a

Following criticism by col-
lege financial aid officers that it is 
unwieldy and partially ineffective, the 
National Science and Mathematics 
Access to Retain Talent Grant has 
introduced new eligibility restric-
tions that could make the already 
exclusive grant even more difficult 
for students to obtain.

While the grant supports low-
income students enrolled in certain 
math, science or foreign language 
majors, those same students will now 
lose this aid if they are not consis-
tently enrolled in at least one class 
specific to that major this year.

A letter written by Assistant 
Secretary to the Office of 
Postsecondary Education Diane 
Jones earlier this month detailed  
ways in which students can lose their 
funding if they fail to carefully regu-
late the classes they enroll in each 
term. Though the document states 
it is simply “additional guidance” in 
response to repeated administrative 
queries, the letter was met with con-
cern by many students and financial 
aid experts.

“If the student were enrolled 
only in courses that satisfy the gen-
eral education requirements of the 
National S.M.A.R.T. Grant-eligible 
program, but not in any courses that 

are specific to the major, he or she 
would not be eligible for a National 
S.M.A.R.T. Grant payment for the 
semester,” Jones said in the letter.

Previously, institutions were not 
required to ensure that students were 
taking one class per grading period 
in their approved major. The new 
restrictions define the way students 
must take classes each grading peri-
od, or risk losing their funding if 
they take even one term of all general 
education requirements. This could 
present difficulties for students who 
finish all their major classes before 
the end of their senior year, or those 
who are unable to enter into heavily 
impacted major classes.

In February 2006, President 
George W. Bush allotted $1.64 bil-
lion to the S.M.A.R.T Grant and the 
Academic Competitiveness Grant for 
the following two years. Half of this 
aid package — available only to third 
and fourth-year students — aims to 
provide incentives for eligible low-
income students to enroll in college 
with specific majors in math, sci-
ence or “critical languages” such as 
Arabic.

Those looking to utilize S.M.A.R.T. 
Grant aid must meet very specific cri-
teria: Students must be U.S. citizens 
attending a baccalaureate degree pro-
gram full-time, be enrolled as a third 
or fourth-year student and maintain

The University of California has 
hired consulting firm R. William 
Funk and Associates to aid in find-
ing prospective candidates for the 
position of UC president. 

The decision, announced on 
Oct. 19, marks another milestone 
in the ongoing search for the new 
systemwide leader, which began in 
mid-August after current President 
Robert C. Dynes announced his

low point of 56 in 2005. These 
agencies also reported that motor 
vehicle theft increased from 102 in 
2005 to 152 in 2006, and that five 
arson cases occurred in 2006, com-
pared to one in 2005. Reported sex 
offenses decreased from six in 2005 
to two in 2006, while aggravated 
assault remained steady at seven for 
both years.

However, the number of these 
crimes that physically occurred on 
campus indicates a downward trend 
in certain areas. Aggravated assaults 
decreased from seven in 2005 to two 
in 2006, and reported on-campus 
sex offenses also decreased from 
five in 2005 to one in 2006. The 

intent to resign next year. 
Based in Dallas, Texas, the firm 

is widely considered to be one of 
the premier search consulting firms 
within the field of higher educa-
tion.

Having conducted recruiting 
searches for over 250 universities 
across the country, the company 
is now faced with the task of find-
ing leadership for the 10-campus 
system.

The company’s services come 
at a fee of $90,000 plus expenses, 
and will extend over a period of 
12 months or until the search is 
completed. 

Richard C. Blum, chairman of 
the UC Board of Regents, expressed 
his satisfaction with the selection of 
the search firm.

“The selection of a new presi-
dent is obviously a crucial step in 

charting the future of the univer-
sity,” Blum said in a press release. 
“The regents are confident that 
Funk and Associates will provide 
the UC community with the profes-
sional assistance to identify the best 
candidates for the position of lead-
ing the world’s pre-eminent public 
research university.”

According to the UC Office 
of the President, the recruitment 
search will be conducted person-
ally by company founder Bill Funk. 
With years of experience in col-
legiate executive recruitment, Funk 
has come to be regarded as one of 
the top higher education insiders in 
the nation. 

“The presidency of the University 
of California is one of the most 
important positions in all of high-

Texas-based consulting 
agency will scour the 
country to aid search  
for aspiring UC 
presidential candidates.

and sex offenses, but

Campus Program Wins 
Innovation Award

UCSD’s Express to Success 
Program has been presented with 
the 2007 Innovative Program Award 
by the National Association of 
Student Personnel Administrators 
Region VI.  

Designed to enhance students’ 
confidence in public speaking, 
improve interpersonal communica-
tion and nurture leadership skills, 
the program will be honored at the 
NASPA 2007 Regional Conference 
on Nov. 2 in Las Vegas.  

“The objective of ETS is to give 
participants the necessary skills to 
be successful UCSD students and to 
continue that success in graduate/
professional school, full-time employ-
ment and/or other person endeavors 
beyond college,” ETS Director Sara 
Henry said in a press release.  

ETS offers many services to 
UCSD students, including one-time 
workshops, quarterly seminars, year-
long programs, tailored programs for 
international and graduate students 
and an advanced peer educator pro-
gram.  

The Innovative Program Award 
is given to an institution or indi-
vidual that enriches campus life and 
aids in community development and 
the growth of staff, students, faculty. 
Innovation and creativity are signifi-
cant criteria in selecting recipients of 
the award.  

As the leading professional asso-
ciation for student affairs adminis-
trators in higher education, NASPA 
serves as the voice for student affairs 
administration, policy and practice 
and supports the commitment to 
integrate student life and learning.  

“Year after year, major employ-
ers that recruit heavily on college 
campuses list communication skills 
as the most important attribute top 
candidates bring to the workplace,” 
Andrew T. Ceperley, director of the 
UCSD Career Services Center, said 
in a press release. 

UCSD Medical Center  
CEO Chosen for FCC

Richard J. Liekweg, chief execu-
tive officer of the UCSD Medical 
Center, was appointed to the Joint 
Advisory Committee of the Federal 
Communications Commission, 
announced university officials on 
Oct. 19.   

As delegated by the 9/11 
Commission Act of 2007, the com-
mittee’s purpose is to evaluate the 
communications capabilities of 
emergency medical and public health 
facilities. The joint committee must 
submit results from their assessment 
to Congress by Feb. 4, 2008.

The committee is comprised 
of 25 members appointed by FCC 
Chairman Kevin J. Martin and U.S. 
Commerce Department Assistant 
Secretary for Communications John 
M.R. Kneur.

“Effective and timely communica-
tion is a vital component of meeting 
health care needs of our communi-
ties, especially during an emergency 
or disaster,” Liekweg said in a press 
release.  “This is a wonderful oppor-
tunity to share best practices and 
assess emerging technologies that 
will foster efficient, timely and safe 
care every day, as well as in those 
critical times when we must rely 
on our emergency communication 
systems.”

UC’s final offer,” she said. “We are 
miles and miles apart on nearly 
every issue right now.”

Kean said that the biggest item 
of contention is the proposed PTO 
program, which would require  
nurses to use their vacation days 
to get time off when they are sick, 
since sick leave would only take 
effect after 24 hours of illness.

“It may sound good, but the 
truth is that it is a very anti-patient 
program,” she said. “It would force 
nurses to go to work when they are 
sick.”

UCSD Medical Center nurse 
Janice Webb said that she does not 

want to even consider implementa-
tion of such a program.

“Nurses can barely afford to live 
in San Diego as it is, and they 
really can’t afford [this program],” 
she said. “It actually cuts your sick 
time in half.”

Kean said that the proposed 
program is not the only area in 
which the university has pursued 
initiatives that fail to provide for 
its employees’ best interests. She 
outlined major staffing problems 
at all university medical facilities, 
including the cancelation of much-
needed shifts as well as mandatory 
shift rotations, which force nurses 
to switch from day shifts to night 
shifts every month, compromising

UC, Nurses Skirmish at a Standstill

By Jesse Alm
Contributing Writer

After six months of negotiating 
a proposal to increase wages and 
benefits for University of California 
nurses, the California Nurses 
Association and university officials 
agreed last week to jointly declare 
an impasse and request the assis-
tance of a state-appointed mediator 
to arrange a compromise.

The university’s proposal high-
lights market-based salary increas-
es, equal health-care benefits and a 
new paid time-off program as the 
major initiatives it would like to 
implement for its nurses. The CNA 
union that represents the nurses 
must approve the changes before the 
university can approve the changes.

“They make a proposal, we make 
a proposal, and we attempt to meet 
in the middle,” said Nicole Savickas, 
human resources and labor coor-
dinator for the UC Office of the 
President, who has been at the UC-
CNA bargaining table during the 
entire process. 

However, Savickas said that 
the approval process is sometimes 
more complicated than it appears, 
since there are actually three parties 
involved: the university, the union 
and over 10,000 California nurses 
who are the university’s employees. 

“There are a number of issues 
that we have not been able to reach 
agreement on,” Savickas said.

CNA’s UC Director Beth Kean 
described Savickas’ sentiment as an 
understatement.

“We are very unhappy with the 

“It may sound good, but the truth is that it is a very anti-patient program.”

their performance. 
In addition, she said that the 

wage disparity among university 
nurses is such that the most expe-
rienced nurses at universities such 
as UCSD and UC Irvine earn less 
money than nurses coming straight 
from college at UC San Francisco — 
discrepancies that the university’s 
current proposal fails to address.

“UC can afford to staff [and pay] 
properly, but they refuse to do so,” 
she said.

Now that both parties have 
agreed to the impasse, the California 
Public Employment Relations 
Board will determine whether a 
deadlock indeed exists. If PERB 
confirms the impasse, it will submit 
the case to the State Mediation and 
Conciliation Service, which will 
assign a neutral mediator to assist 
with negotiations.

Savickas said that the media-
tor should begin work in the next 
few weeks, and she is hopeful that 
the mediator will resolve what she 
considers to be minimal remaining 
disagreements.

Kean said she is less optimistic, 
recalling that in 2005 and 2006, the 
mediator was unsuccessful in finding 
a compromise. She said she believes 
that, as in past years, the process will 
reach the next step, during which a 
fact-finding panel reviews each side’s 
complaints in more depth.

Webb agreed that the media-
tion process is impersonal and 
disjointed, and added that nurses 
are frustrated with the university’s 
recurring attempts to pass unpopu-
lar measures.

“The UC likes to play hard-
ball,” she said. “But the nurses have 
learned over the past few years, 
and we’re getting good at playing 
hardball too.”

for those with pre-made lesson plans

sors have expressed willingness to

Admins, Students Cope With Unstable Campus Conditions
THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007

Clockwise from top: Evacuees huddle in sleeping bags at Qualcomm Stadium, grabbing a bit of respite early last week, when San Diego’s fires were at their worst; Volunteers took up a range of duties at Qualcomm, 
even opting to entertain somber evacuees; So much was donated to those in need that volunteers had to sort through bundles of clothing items; Children at Qualcomm were delighted to find toys and stuffed animals among 
the stacks of donated items; Annette Farnaes, mother of UCSD graduate student Lauge Farnaes, was forced to move her livestock out of her endangered home in Jamul to the Mesa graduate-student apartments.

While the recent outbreak of San 
Diego wildfires did not directly force 
any students or staff members off cam-
pus, approximately three-fourths of 
resident students opted to leave UCSD 
voluntarily last week, citing concerns 
of growing evacuation zones and poor 
air quality. Those who remained were 
led by an emergency policy council of 
administrators and safety personnel, 
tasked with determining how the cam-
pus would respond to, and ultimately 
recover from, the worst fire disaster in 
the county’s history.

Headed by Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox and run by Vice Chancellor of 
Business Affairs Steven W. Relyea, the 
council ultimately decided to cancel all 
classes from Oct. 22-26 due to concerns 
about students’ safety and well-being. 
Nonessential staff members were also 
encouraged not to report to campus 
during that period.

“The group assessed the immedi-
ate threat to the campus,” Associate 
Vice Chancellor of University 
Communications Stacie A. Spector said 
in an e-mail. “Due to the extremely 
poor air quality, the high number of 
evacuations causing severe traffic con-
gestion, the personal situation that stu-
dents, staff and faculty might be facing 
with their own families and homes 
and the potential threat to the campus

Back Home: 
Evacuating 

and Returning

due to the proximity of the fire … 
[the group] provided a recommenda-
tion to the chancellor that canceling 
classes would be the most prudent 
and healthy decision.” 

After choosing to cancel classes 
for the week, the council subsequently 
debated whether Fall Quarter should 
be extended to make up for the missed 
teaching days. UC Provost Wyatt 
R. Hume ultimately approved Fox’s 
proposal to reduce days of instruc-
tion for the quarter, meaning there 
will be no make-up week, UC Office 
of the President spokesman Ricardo 
Vazquez said. The deadline to drop a 
class without receiving a withdrawal 
mark was also extended from Oct. 26 
to Nov. 2.

Though a campuswide e-mail 
from Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue urged professors 
to delay exams and assignments by a 
week to accommodate students who 
have been impacted by the fires, some 
students have expressed uncertain-
ty about what to expect when they 
return to classes on Oct. 29.

“I guess [the missed week] will 
take away from the amount of material 
that I will pick up in my classes,” John 
Muir College senior Daniel Casillas 
said. “I’m kind of in limbo about what 
to have done when I get back.”

must maintain patience with affected 
students while simultaneously con-

While some students and staff 
members dealt with evacuation con-
cerns by leaving UCSD, others spent 
the week-long break from classes tak-
ing refuge on campus.

Like many students, Sixth College 
senior Michael Kelly is a San Diego 
native. Though Kelly lives away from 
his family’s Rancho Santa Fe home, he 
said he was glad when the mandatory 
evacuations were lifted from his neigh-
borhood so that he could return home 
with his family to check on things.

“[My family] didn’t have much 
warning to pack up,” Kelly said. “They 
had to leave the cat behind, and it was 
really kind of a fiasco.”

After seeing news reports of the 
fires, Kelly’s father called his family at 
home and told them to leave imme-
diately. They stayed with friends in La 
Jolla for three days while the fire swept 
through their neighborhood. Kelly was 
in San Diego for the 2003 Cedar Fires, 
but said he felt the 2007 fires had a 
much greater impact.

“Everybody knows somebody who 
had to evacuate,” Kelly said. “I was here 
for the Cedar Fires but it was nowhere 
as big as this … it got a lot closer this 
time, at least to where I was.”

Graduate student Lauge Farnaes’ 
family lives in nearby Jamul, where 
fires ravaged much of the rural locale. 
Farnaes said that even though her fam-
ily fled with their farm animals to 
her La Jolla apartment, school officials 
were very accommodating.

“UCSD Police and Housing and 
Dining Services have been awesome,” 
Farnaes said. “My folks got evacu-
ated with two dogs, two horses and 
one mule from the fire and we’re now 
in [the Mesa graduate-student apart-
ments] with the animals outside on 
the grass.”

Mira Mesa resident and Revelle 
College senior Alicia Yeh packed her 
car on Oct. 22 and headed straight for 
Qualcomm Stadium with two of her 
roommates. 

“We did the voluntary evacuation,” 
Yeh said. “We started to panic when 
the smoke was getting really thick … a 
couple of hours later they did a manda-
tory evacuation of our area anyhow.”

Yeh spent the night in a tent and 
stayed at the stadium until the manda-
tory evacuation was lifted from Mira 
Mesa the following afternoon. 

“People were friendly,” Yeh said of 
her Qualcomm experience. “There 
were a lot of volunteers who gave us 
food, toothpaste, soap, tons of blankets 
— everything you’d need.”

remained on campus to perform their usual 
duties, others were dispatched to more severely 
affected areas — such as Ramona, Julian, Chula 
Vista and Coronado — to assist in evacuations, 
traffic control and preserving public safety.

A large percentage of those who chose to 
remain on campus were heavily involved in 
outreach efforts for fire victims, said Center 
for Student Involvement Director Emily Marx. 
A campuswide relief group, consisting of 
members from CSI, UCSD Staff Association, 
UCSD Alumni Association, UCSD Student 
Foundation, the A.S. Council, the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee and the Student 
Affairs Offices, has been coordinating mul-
tiple volunteer projects such as donation and 

blood drives throughout 
the past week.

“We wanted to do some 
things that are immediate 
responses based on the 
needs of the community, 
and also work on some 
longer-term ideas,” Marx 
said. “We’ve been brain-
storming a lot of ideas, 
but they’ll be more con-
crete when we see who [at 
UCSD] is affected.”

University officials 
have enacted several 

options to ease the transition for displaced stu-
dents and staff members, including programs 
for emergency loans and donations of paid 
leave. Administrators also established a hotline 
to assist any UCSD affiliate whose home was 
destroyed in the fire.

Spector said the outpouring of support is 
a testament to the community atmosphere 
fostered at UCSD.

“The spirit of service, volunteerism, com-
munity and cooperation are clearly vibrant at 
UCSD,” she said. “Many people who work for 
UCSD that service patients and students were 
dealing with their own personal situations 
related to the fire, but they showed up for 
work anyway as dedicated UCSD personnel 
who not only have a tremendous work ethic, 
but their commitment to the constituents of 
the campus remain steadfast, in light of this 
challenge.”

instruction basically feels like a non-issue.”
Following the cancelation announcement, 

about 6,000 students self-evacuated from cam-
pus, dropping the population of apartments 
and residence halls from 8,000 to approxi-
mately 2,000 by Oct. 25.

“When people heard classes were canceled 
and there was still a possibility of evacuation, 
a large number of them left,” said Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior and Resident Adviser 
Emily Lipoma. “A lot of our job was to get info 
to our residents and keep them calm.”

While some students may have left due to 
health concerns, others had different motives 
for exiting campus, said Earl Warren College 
sophomore and RA Nastasha 
Tan.

“The majority of my resi-
dents left, but I think a lot of 
them used the fire hazard 
as an opportunity to visit 
home,” Tan said.

In a campuswide e-mail 
sent on Oct. 22, Fox referred 
to the air quality at UCSD 
as “extremely unhealthy.” 
However, Housing and 
Dining Services Director 
Mark P. Cunningham said 
in an e-mail that he did not 
believe this was the primary reason why stu-
dents chose to evacuate.

“I think the canceling of classes did [it] for 
the most part, but poor air quality was likely 
a contributing factor for some students,” he 
said.

Lipoma and Tan said they received clear 
instructions on how to handle a possible evac-
uation from their respective residence life 
offices, although many RAs had to dispel 
rumors of an imminent evacuation that spread 
among residents.

“There were a lot of rumors that went 
around,” Warren College junior and RA 
Jonathan Stenstrom said. “We heard a lot of 
different things, but we just told them what 
went on in the emergency meetings.”

Despite rumors of evacuation, UCSD 
Police Lt. David Rose said the campus has 
responded generally well to the crisis, with a 
majority of calls to the police department com-
ing from parents seeking to get in contact with 
their children. While some UCPD officers

Fire-Related Patient Load Lands 
on UCSD’s Hillcrest Burn Unit

By Sneha Bhamre
Senior Staff Writer

After treading up five flights of stairs 
and stepping through the double doors 
leading into the burn unit at the UCSD 
Medical Center in Hillcrest, one’s senses 
are immediately assaulted with the jar-
ring smell of burnt flesh hanging heavily 
in the air. The tenacity with which the 
18-bed unit has tackled the strains of an 
unprecedented fire emergency has once 
again made the hospital a hub of media 
attention, this time for treating victims of 
the devastating fires this week. 

Recognized as the only specialized 
burn unit in the San Diego and Imperial 
counties, the hospital has treated many 
of the area’s fire victims. To date, the unit 
has treated 47 fire-related injuries due to 
surface or inhalation burns. Currently, 
there are eight patients in critical condi-
tion and 10 in rehabilitation. Nineteen 
out of the 20 other patients that were pre-
viously in critical care have been upgrad-
ed to the hospital’s general ward.

Laura Everett, an administrative assis-
tant, described last week in the burn unit 
as “chaotic, but in control.”

Burn Unit Charge Nurse Janine 
Dubina, like all of the staff, underwent 
a harrowing week dealing with crisis 
conditions in the unit. Living between 
Lakeside and Ramona, she had to evacu-
ate early in the week, but still came to 
work ready and able.

Most patients came in during the first 
two days of the fire, and while new cases 
have tapered off for the moment, Dubina 
said she expects the number of patients 

to increase as the weeks progress. She 
said that more people will likely start 
trickling in now that the fires have died 
down and residents are returning to their 
normal routines like after 2003’s Cedar 
Fires, the disaster that put the burn unit 
in the national spotlight.

“Most people didn’t come in to seek 
care because they were worried about 
their home and their family,” Dubina 
said. 

The current patients’ burn degrees 
range from 20-90 percent, some of them 
being treated for inhalation as well as 
surface burns. Although response efforts 
brought victims in quickly enough to be 

intubated before any internal swelling 
choked off their airways, some patients’ 
bodies have swelled so much internally 
that removal of intubation tubes is now 
impossible. 

Among those still being cared for are 
two severely burned patients who were 
found running in canyons after being 
surprised by the rapidly spreading fire. 
Both are wrapped in bandages and gauze 
from head to foot, hooked up to breath-
ing tubes, and unable to rest on their 
backs. Brought in on Oct. 23, the pair has 
been identified as “border crossers” after

14 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007

number of reported burglaries still 
shows a significant upsurge, moving 
from 52 in 2005 to 91 in 2006, but 
the increase in on-campus motor 
vehicle thefts was not as steep, with 
64 thefts reported in 2005 compared 
to 73 in 2006 — an increase of only 
nine on campus compared to 50 in 
the UCSD area. 

Campus security authorities, 
including the UCPD as well as vari-
ous staff and resident advisers, also 
gave out more on-campus alcohol-
related disci-
plinary referrals 
— jumping from 
1,193 in 2005 to 
1,380 last year. 

Drug refer-
rals reported by 
campus secu-
rity authorities 
increased slightly 
from 96 in 2005 
to 104 in 2006. 
UCPD also made 
34 arrests for 
drug or narcot-
ics offenses, six arrests for weapons 
offenses and 30 arrests for alcohol 
offenses on campus last year. 

According to UCPD Lt. David 
Rose, the crime statistics gathered 
in the report do not directly dictate 
the department’s activities, since they 
strive to curtail problems as they 
occur.

“Typically, the Clery is more 
a summary of activity,” Rose said. 
“The statistics in the Clery report 
are tracked throughout the year, so 
for instance, if we notice an increase 
in auto thefts or bike thefts or issues 
surrounding alcohol, we’re usually 
aware of it in very short order and 
we’ll take steps to address it.”

Rose added that the Clery report 
mainly influences the department in 

terms of public perception — should 
the public perceive that areas on cam-
pus were unsafe, for example, the 
department would usually hold work-
shops or public meetings to increase 
awareness of the issue.

“We work with the City of San 
Diego and get statistics from them 
too, so we’re trying to be proactive,” 
he said. “That’s not to say we can pre-
vent everything, but if those statistics 
jump out at you, they jumped out at 
us a long time ago.”

The report is required under the 
Jeanne Clery 
D i s c l o s u r e 
of Campus 
Security Policy 
and Campus 
Crime Statistics 
Act, a federal 
law signed in 
1990 that applies 
to all universities 
participating in 
federal financial 
aid programs. 

The legisla-
tion is enforced 

by the U.S. Department of Education, 
and gross violations of the law could 
cause a university to lose all federal 
financial aid. 

The act mandates that Clery 
reports include statistics for crimes 
reported on and near college cam-
puses for the last three years, as well 
as descriptions of police department 
policies, crime-prevention programs 
and investigation procedures for 
reported sex offenses. It also requires 
the police departments to issue “time-
ly warnings” about ongoing crimes in 
the community and to keep a daily 
campus crime log that is open to the 
public.

a 3.0 GPA. 
Another restriction involves their 

previous placement: If a student did 
not attend an academically “rigorous” 
institution during high school, they 
are automatically ineligible.

Though permanent legal residents 
are eligible for many other financial 
aid programs, they are excluded from 
S.M.A.R.T. Grant eligibility.

Since the grant is aimed at low-
income students who may choose to 
attend school part-time while work-
ing, the grant’s restrictions effectively 
disqualify many of those who must 
support themselves or their families 
by working full-time, or forces them 
to both work and attend school full-
time.

Bill Frist, former Republican 
Senator from Tennessee and initiator 
of the S.M.A.R.T. Grant, said that new 
support for math and science educa-
tion would increase America’s ability 
to compete in the global economy.

“China and India are generating 
scientists and engineers at a furi-
ous pace while America lags danger-
ously behind,” Frist told the New York 
Times in December 2005.

The S.M.A.R.T. and AC grants 
are available only to students already 
eligible for the Pell Grant, which Bush 
boosted funds to last month when he 

increased the grant’s maximum allot-
ment to $4,800 for the 2008-09 aca-
demic year. Specific benefits include 
up to $4,000 per eligible S.M.A.R.T. 
Grant student for each year, in addi-
tion to the Pell Grant funds students 
receive. This represents a significant 
increase from the AC Grant, intended 

for first- and second-year students, 
where $750 and $1,300 are available, 
respectively.

Mark Kantrowitz, founder of 
financial aid Web site FinAid.org, 
has lobbied for an increase of the Pell 
Grant to $7,500. He said he believes 
that this program effectively achieves 
the goal of an increased Pell Grant 
for the low-income students who are 
looking to enter the eligible majors. 

“Increasing the Pell Grant to 

roughly $8,000 [through the addi-
tion of S.M.A.R.T. Grant funds] will 
eliminate loans from the financial 
aid packages of many low income 
students, removing one of the major 
impediments to their enrollment in 
higher education,” Kantrowitz said in 
an e-mail.

He also said he sees the S.M.A.R.T. 
Grant as filling a specific niche in stu-
dent aid. 

“To the extent that the S.M.A.R.T. 
Grant is a hybrid between need-based 
aid and merit aid, it is filling the gap 
for some needy students,” he said. 
“That will serve as an incentive for 
students to enter those fields.”

Major questions posed by critics 
of the S.M.A.R.T. Grant include how 
lost aid can be recovered if students 
no longer qualify for the grant as they 
move into another year of college, as 
well as how the low percentage of Pell 
Grant students that also qualify for 
the National S.M.A.R.T. Grant can 
be explained. A mere 4 percent of 
Pell Grant students qualified for this 
year’s S.M.A.R.T. Grant. 

The U.S. Department of Education 
looks to double the number of AC 
and National S.M.A.R.T. Grant recip-
ients nationwide by 2011.

pleased to have been entrusted by

tion services, R. William Funk and

wide range of experience.

being found by the Border Patrol.
Dubina said their story is as chill-

ing as the injuries they sustained.
“You can tell they had their hands 

covering their faces,” she said. “There 
were people running behind them, 
but when they looked back, they 
were gone.”

The intensity of their injuries and 
their status made it difficult to iden-
tify the patients until three days after 
they came to the burn unit.

Dubina said that one of the major 
health concerns from the fires is 
smoke inhalation. Having burned 
through many commercial and resi-
dential developments, smoke is rife 
with plastics, paint and other chemi-
cal pollutants that can cause lung 
damage. Smaller particles in the air 
farther away from the fires can be 
more hazardous than the smoke and 
ash closer to the fires themselves. 

In order to protect patients and 
staff from the outside air, high-
efficiency particulate air filters are 
stationed near the unit’s doors, and 
indoor air quality is checked daily to 
ensure a sterile environment.

Lasting impressions from the 
Cedar Fires pushed the county to 
make sure that the same mistakes 
would not be repeated.

For instance, the implementa-
tion of a reverse-911 program saved 
many more lives last week, allow-
ing people to evacuate properly and 
be informed ahead of time of the 
disaster. The hospital also now has a 
better-developed relationship with 
Cal Fire, allowing for stronger lines 
of communication, Dubina said.

“For everyone that complains 
about UCSD running disaster drills, 
this is the reason we knew what to 
do,” she said. 

The staff prides itself on a strong 
sense of camaraderie, a bond that 
staff members said helped strength-
en their team’s efficiency when 
patients began to piling up at the 
burn unit.

Many nurses and doctors  
ignored orders to evacuate their 
homes, instead coming in to work 
12-hour shifts and occasionally 
overtime, just to make sure the 
unit wasn’t left short-handed. On 
Oct. 21, the unit was graced with 
extra nurses, according to regis-
tered nurse Jami Lewellen.

“Night shift nurses stepped out-
side and smelled smoke on the air, 
they just knew to come in,” she 
said.

Even students from UCSD who 
normally volunteer at the hospi-
tal came to help, retrieving any 
extra equipment or blood that was 
needed, even though campus had 
shut down for the week. People 
from around the county brought in 
lunches and dinners for the burn 
unit’s staff members, creating an 
environment where nurses and 
doctors rarely, if ever, need to leave 
the floor.

Everett said she attributes the 
unit’s success in the past week to its 
very close-knit core staff.

“We’re more like an extended 
family,” she said.

tance out of harm’s way throughout the 
duration of the fires, many students 
living on campus took the week off 
from classes as an opportunity to leave 
school. Approximately 75 percent of 
student residents left campus, some 
to go home, others to take week-long 
vacations, traveling to places like San 
Francisco and Las Vegas.

Sixth College freshman Kaveh 
Nikou lives on campus in a residence 
hall but decided to stay, saying he 
wasn’t too concerned about his safety 
on campus.

“[UCSD’s response to the fires] 
was pretty good,” he said. “Although 
Monday night we weren’t sure what 
was going on and people weren’t telling 
us much. [Tritonlink] was a big help.”

In addition to the Web site, he 
got most of his information from his 
roommates. For Nikou and his friends, 

the fires came as a much-welcomed 
break from classwork.

“I’ve been able to get back on track 
with homework and stuff,” he said. “I’ve 
just been relaxing, talking to people; it’s 
a kind of bonding experience even 
though at the same time it’s bad.” 

Much like Nikou, Making of the 
Modern World lecturer Edmond 
Chang spent time on campus last 
week, when his family had to evacuate 
their Rancho Penasquitos home. 

“Safety was the first concern 
— [UCSD] was close enough to the 
ocean, in case the fire pushed west 
incessantly,” Chang said in an e-mail. 
“Second, my kids had been in my 
office many times before, so I thought 
it would be easier on them and on my 
mother than heading to Qualcomm.”

Chang, his spouse, three children 
and mother spent two nights in his on-
campus office.

“[Staying in my office was] very 
comfortable actually,” Chang said. 
“There are couches in the lobby, drink-
ing water from a dispenser, great sushi 
for me and jumbo hot dogs for my 
kids from Cafe Ventanas and plenty of 
computers for my spouse and I to keep 
track of news.”

Although his office was comfort-
able, Chang was pleasantly surprised 
at the generosity and maturity from 
Eleanor Roosevelt College students he 
said he experienced. 

“After some of my MMW4 students 
found out about our situation, we 
received many offers for us to use their 
apartments,” he said. “Crisis reveals 
many things about people. I was reas-
sured and inspired by what I witnessed 
in my students this week.”

To be honest, I was happy when I woke up on Oct. 22 to find out that school was canceled. Wildfires, schmildfires — I just wanted some extra hours of 
snooze time. 

Then, when I heard classes were canceled on Oct. 23, I 
was ecstatic; two most-likely difficult midterms were post-
poned, giving me extra time to study.

I spent the day lounging with my friends and watching 
the television’s fire coverage, joking about the brown ashes 
hovering in the distance, the source of the “unhealthy air” 
that forced UCSD to shut down. 

I wasn’t really grasping the concept that people’s homes 
— and lives — were burning to the ground while remained 
safe at home and took the day off, and that’s all that mat-
tered, right?

When I was asked to head to the Mira Mesa High School 
evacuation center to interview evacuees for the Guardian, I 
didn’t hesitate. It would be cake, I thought. I would do my 
interviews, type them out and then head to the bars for a 
night of drinking.

I didn’t expect to pull up to a parking lot overflowing 
with vehicles. After finding a spot, I headed past a large 
canopy housing volunteers who sorted through donated 
bottled water, blankets and food. 

I kept walking, and was immediately struck by the dozens 
of people I saw camping out in tents in the quad. Hundreds 
more lined the gym.

The first person I talked to — Joy Stone, 37, of Rancho 
Bernardo, one of the hardest-hit areas — looked exhausted 
and bleary-eyed.

Do we have the computer backed up?”That was the question from my nearly 50-year-old mother, a poster child for living young-at-heart. A petite 
woman, she has always prided herself on a high threshold for 
danger. Never in my life, however, have I seen her so distraught 
as the day my house barely escaped utter demolition. 

I come from a fairly irrelevant Orange County town where 
wildfires are far from uncommon and they always seemed to 
work themselves out in the end. At the first sign of a firestorm’s 
subsidence, families would resume innocent rounds of Frisbee, 
catch and other storybook activities.

This past week, there was no ebullience to speak of. An 
uncontained fire spawned torched houses, scarlet skies  and heli-
copters buzzing overhead. In other words, my once pristine and

As the four of us climbed into my boyfriend’s Honda Accord I felt a rush of adventure — we were going to drive into the fire’s den to get back to our evacuated house. Or 
try to, at least.

But it’s easier said than done. My father, sitting in the passen-
ger seat, was wearing an FBI hat he bought during our last trip to 
Universal Studios. He lives off of Highway 67 and less than a mile 
from Poway Road; The area had been cut off from access for days 
with roads leading to our house heavily barricaded and policed.

As we approached the roadblock my hands grew clammy 
— there was no way we would pull this off. My dad got out with 
his knock-off FBI hat on, and walked right up to the officer as if 
he owned the place. They exchanged some words, after which the 
officer said, “I’m sorry boss, but I can’t even let you in, not with

While a large number of fellow San Diegans were pack-ing their lives into their cars and preparing for the drive to Qualcomm Stadium, I was busy discovering 
a whole new definition of awkward. Knocked out by a nasty flu, I 
spent a day and a half sandwiched on the couch between my still-
technically-married-but-not-for-long parents, who, along with 
my two teenage brothers and two dogs, were evacuated from our 
Carmel Valley home Tuesday evening.

Though my two-bedroom apartment near UCSD was safely 
out of any fire zones, it was not particularly equipped to hold 
seven stressed-out, sleep-deprived people with a long history of 
gripes and grudges. In between apologizing to my roommate 
and trying to keep two nervous golden retrievers from alerting 
our landlady to the “no pets” rule violation, I had little time to

OPINION



MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

cheery neighborhood had been trans-
muted into a bona fide war zone. 

Never a hero, I decided to return to 
school, hoping for a change of scenery. 
I was aware of the fires that had taken 
hold of San Diego, but knew UCSD 
was in no tangible danger. So no one 
could possibly blow things out of pro-
portion. Needless to say, I was dead 
wrong.

I understand that proliferating ash 
and smoke could pose a potentially 
noxious threat to people suffering 
from pulmonary or cardiac conditions, 
but for UCSD’s healthy bookworms I 
doubt that two-minute walk to Cafe 
Ventanas would cause any permanent 
damage. Spare me the frantic scramble 
for those heinous-looking masks. 

I find it funny that a youthful popu-
lation so entrenched in delusions of 
invincibility can be this terrified of 
something so unthreatening. Air qual-
ity aside, UCSD’s physical campus was 
in no danger, so why the melodramatic 
rumors of campus evacuation?  

Given the circumstances, I find it 
entirely reasonable to be concerned 
for one’s general well-being, especially 
those with asthma. But for the rest of 
us, we were never officially instructed 
to evacuate (and if we were it would 
have been appallingly unfounded) so 
take it easy, UCSD. 

Your cherished dorm room will 
not go up in flames. Classes will soon 
resume and your postponed midterms 
will be just as much a headache as they 
were before the alleged on-campus 
disaster. Godspeed, Tritons. If I can be 
so optimistic: When the next catastro-
phe strikes, let’s hope we’re equipped 
with full-body bio-protection suits — 
and maybe some freeze-dried omelets 
or something for good measure.

Fire Response Unveils Lessons Learned for Federal OfficialsDisaster Elicits 
Unjustified 

Campus Panic
▶ HYSTERIA, from page 5

By Natasha Naraghi
Opinion Editor 

Although the recent fires charred 
close to 350,000 acres and destroyed 
well over a thousand homes, San 
Diegans still have much to be thank-
ful for.

When the disaster started over 
a week ago, many worried that the 
mass evacuations might induce a 
Hurricane Katrina-like chaos, but 
things remained exceptionally calm 
as the number of evacuees soared 
over 500,000. 

Qualcomm Stadium was almost 
picturesque — a far cry from the 
disorderly nature of the Louisiana 
Superdome at the height of Katrina. 
Instead of violence, drug deals and 
suicide attempts there were activi-
ties for the kids along with musical 
performances, massages and buffets 
for the adults.

Volunteers came in droves to 
aid evacuees as the National Guard 
stood watch to prevent any possible 
outbreak of violence. Their weapons, 
however, were never needed thanks 
to the efforts of disaster-response 
officials who were quick to meet the 
needs of evacuated citizens. 

But Qualcomm was not the only 
success. In fact, evacuation cen-
ters across the county have done 
an equally impressive job housing  
hoards of homeowners and pets that 
flocked to their facilities in search of 
shelter from the fire. 

What many expected to be a 
political hot potato for state and 
national officials turned out to be 

a showing of their commitment to 
improving disaster-response proce-
due.

The president, especially, 
had learned Katrina’s lesson well. 
Whereas congressional leaders com-
plained of slow federal response for 
the 2005 hurricane, the president 
promptly declared a state of emer-
gency in Southern California on 
Oct. 23. The action allowed Federal 
Emergency Management Agency 

officials to begin dispersing aid to 
those most affected by the fires — 
which caused more than $1 billion 
in damage to San Diego County.

With FEMA able to distribute 
grants, local officials throughout the 
county, along with members of the 
state’s Office of Emergency Services, 
were quick to establish relief centers 
that fire victims could visit for a 
bevy of services. 

Given the necessity of these cen-
ters in the rebuilding of San Diego, 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
efforts to speed their development 
should be commended. 

Even localized efforts to cope 
with the fire’s aftermath have been 
executed without a hitch. UCSD, 
for example, acted quickly to notify 
students of school closures. 

In order to allow affected 
students and faculty the proper 

recovery time, they have delayed 
class deadlines, billing dates and 
Winter Quarter enrollment; reduced 
instruction days, established coun-
seling services and donation pro-
grams; offered $3,000 loans to fac-
ulty and staff who are victims of the 
fire and encouraged professors to 
modify or reduce syllabi to manage 
the lost days.

However, the most impressive 
response by far has come from San 
Diegans themselves — friends and 
families that opened their homes to 
evacuees, that stood in line for hours 
to donate food, blankets and cots 
at the shelters and that helped 
elderly neighbors pack their 
cars and leave their homes. 
We also cannot forget the cou-
rageous fire fighters — many 
of which were evacuated from 
their own homes — who toiled 
around the clock to save homes 
and extinguish the fire.Even 
during disaster, these 
men and women dis-
played kindness and 
concern. 

And so, despite the 
losses that many face in 
the coming days, San 
Diegans can feel com-
fort in knowing the 
strength of their com-
munity and the 
determination of 
its people. 

“What many expected to be a political hot potato for state and national officials turned out to 
be a showing of their 

commitment.”

Despite record numbers 
of evacuees, state and 
federal officials managed 
the fire disaster with a 
newfound ease.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007

She told me that her home had 
burned down and she was able to 
make it out with no possessions 
other than the clothes on her back 
and her two cats.

More upset about losing her 
possessions — she talked at length 
about a toy train set from her 
father’s childhood, and I dared not 
interrupt her — than her home, she 

never once cried.
Instead, she expressed grati-

tude for the volunteers at the shel-
ter, emphasizing how patient and 
accommodating they were. 

A cell phone call finally inter-
rupted our conversation, and she 
smiled, shook my hand and thanked 
me for talking to her before answer-
ing.

I didn’t go out that night.

contemplate the white elephant in the 
room: If the Witch Creek fire made it 
to the coast, our family home would 
be lost.

I’ve lived in San Diego my whole 
life, and although 2003’s Cedar Fires 
were catastrophic in nature, they never 
got close enough to char my bubble of 
safety. This time, however, it got to me. 
Maybe the situation was exacerbated by 
the circumstances of my illness and the 
shouting matches between my parents, 
but for the first time in my sheltered 21 
years — I feared for my family’s safety 

and well-being. Until you’ve experi-
enced it, there’s really no way to explain 
how vulnerable it makes you feel.

I can now look back on the events 
of four years ago as more than just a 
week of dark orange skies and raining 
ash. When all the Cedar Fires meant 
to me was seven days of no classes and 
frequent asthma attacks, I didn’t have 
to think about the “What ifs.” My fam-
ily was there with me, convincing me 
that everything was going to be fine 
and I had no real cause for alarm.

I guess family roles change as you 
grow older.

those civilians in the car.”
We had been rejected and would 

have to return to our temporary digs, 
not knowing if our house was still 
standing. But somehow, in the midst 
of chaos and apprehension, there was 
a refreshing element of humor. There 
we were, concocting outlandish stories 
for the police in an attempt to get back 
home. How had we gotten here? I 
thought back to the start of the week. 

Early in the morning on Oct. 22, I 
awoke in an indescribable panic to a 
call from my editor telling me school 
had been canceled for the day — there 
were several developing fires in the 
northeast portion of the county.

My thoughts immediately went to 
my dad, whose house had burned in 
the 2003 Cedar Fires under a previous 
owner. Scrambling for my computer 
with one ear glued to the radio, I franti-
cally searched for news for anything to 
quell the fear, but the information was 
just too scattered. All I could gather was 
that my parents were under mandatory 
evacuation — something they had yet 
to mention. So without any hesitation I 
picked up the phone.

“Dad, what’s going on? Where’s the 
fire? Why haven’t you left yet?”

My parents were at their house and  
weren’t leaving. My dad was outside 
with a generator, pump and fire hose, 
draining the water out of the pool to  
douse the surrounding area in liquid, 

in an effort to deter the fire should it 
approach the house. 

And so, against the wishes of my 
parents, I set out for Poway, determined 
to reach them and convince them to 
leave their increasingly threatened 
home. Cruising through deserted free-
ways, I was haunted by an eerie feeling; 
No one wants to see their city looking 
like a ghost town. 

When I reached Poway, however, 
the sight worsened. Fallen trees lined 

the streets and flames engulfed the 
hillside near my parents’ house. It was 
like hell on earth.  

Nearing the house, I was confronted 
with a crew of police officers blocking 
the road to Highway 67 and directing 
drivers away from the fire zone. With 
no other choice, I pulled into a nearby 
parking lot filled with officers and spec-
tators. I stood on the street watching 
flames bud on the hill as helicopters 
arrived to drop retardents. For the next 

three hours I waited for my parents to 
come down the hill, and when they 
finally did I met them with the greatest 
sigh of relief I’ve ever had.

The rest of the week was spent in 
much the same manner — waiting. 
Waiting after I got the call that my 
mother was also forced to leave her 
home in Rancho Santa Fe. Waiting as 
news rolled in that close friends and 
family had lost their homes. Waiting 
as the plumes grew larger and the hope 
grew dimmer. Waiting at the corner of 
Highway 67 and Poway Road as cops 
and National Guardsmen armed with 
shotguns staved off frustrated civilians 
clamoring to get back home. 

The end could not have come soon 
enough. Our house had survived. After 
all the waiting we could finally go home; 
never had I felt so lucky. And as I drove 
back through the mountainous roads 
to my father’s house I realized just how 
fortunate we had been. Charred lands 
surrounded the area less than half a 
mile from the house and with each 
passing hour came another tragic story 
of a family home lost to the fire. 

I cannot begin to comprehend the 
loss that many have undergone this 
past week, but their strength has not 
ceased to impress me. The road ahead 
is long, but if there’s anything to be 
learned from the disaster, it’s that family 
and friends will always get us through. 
And that imitation FBI parapherna-
lia is surprisingly believable.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

S tudent Center has been consumed with con-struction over the last three years, and many of the site’s organizations have suffered as a result. 
But at least one is ready to make a solid comeback: 
KSDT, UCSD’s student-run Internet-broadcast radio 
station.

For the last two years, the station has been plagued 
with construction-related issues and mechanical prob-
lems that has largely kept it off the air. According to 
Sixth College senior and KSDT General Manager Ivan 
Dominguez, delays began when a large mound of dirt 
was stored just outside the radio’s DJ booth because of 
construction. Then disaster hit.

“There were really heavy rains that year and all that 
dirt became mud,” Dominguez said. “It slid underneath 
the walls and came up through the floors.”

The office was damaged during the mudslide and 
had to be vacuumed for days, putting the station out 
of service for close to two quarters and resulting in the 
loss of about half the station’s record collection. The 
station’s aged, main mixing board then stopped work-
ing which postponed the radio’s schedule yet again.

 “Last year we were inundated with construction,” 
KSDT Operations Manager Honoré Pedigo said. “We 
tried to move some place else but it didn’t work out 
properly, so we were down for the entire year. … This 
is our first quarter back after a year of being gone. We’re 
actually really grateful for all the DJs who were here 
before and who have now come back. It’s been a whole 
new challenge trying to advertise and get everything 
back up and telling people we exist when they haven’t 
previously seen us.”

The station’s staff faces one main obstacle in raising 
their profile to gain an audience: UCSD students can’t 
stumble across the station on the radio because KSDT 
only streams from its Web site at ksdt.ucsd.edu.

According to Dominguez, KSDT started out as 
a true radio station, but soon had to move to purely 
online broadcasting.

 “In a few years, airways filled up and low fre-
quency transmissions were outlawed by [the Federal 
Communications Commission] in San Diego and 
Mexican airspace … even if we had a signal, a lot of it 
would get squashed out by other signals.”

Pedigo added that the FCC expenses were another 
challenge in becoming a real radio station. 

“I would love to, but it’s just not feasible for us at 
this point,” she said.

Instead, the station continually streams from its 
Web site while remaining dedicated to its “fiercely 
independent” roots. 

“We try to shy away from [playing] anything that 
really deviates from the mission of the radio station, 
which is to provide an alternate music source for every-
one — stuff other than what you hear on the radio,” 
Dominguez said.

Music Directors Cynthia Orantes and Juan Landeros 
decide what can be played on KSDT; they listen to all 
CDs and demos sent to the station, then choose what 
is added to the station’s library. The pair also has the 
power to reject artists from KSDT broadcasts based on 
their rising popularity on regular radio stations.

However, Pedigo said the types of music KSDT DJs 
play don’t change based on the opinions of the music 
directors.

“DJs are required to play at least two new adds a 
show, but other than that they can play whatever is in 
our music library or in their personal library.”

The number of DJs changes at least every quarter, 
constantly altering KSDT’s style of music.

“If you have never been a DJ before, we’ll train you 
and give you a show if there’s a slot open,” Pedigo said.  
“We try to be as open as possible and as friendly as 
possible.”

Although the station is currently broadcasting a 
random mix of songs from its automated DJ, dubbed 
“Satan,” live shows should start within the next two 
weeks. The station’s future plans include live bands, 
dance parties and possibly even an online magazine.

KSDT fosters a relaxing and welcoming environ-
ment that encourages students to discover new and 
unknown music.

“It’s just a big community space and you can just 
hang out and meet people,” Pedigo said. “I can just 
come in, do my show, play the music as loud as I want 
and just sit back and chill. There’s no better feeling in 
the world for me than that. That will make my day.”

SITE SEEN
A nyone who has ever visited southern Spain knows the food is hit or miss. When the Spaniards hit, though, they 
hit. San Diego restaurant Cafe Sevilla serves 
up the region’s best of the best while delight-
ing diners with authentic flamenco shows, 
allowing them to skip the Lays jamón jamón 
potato chips, a ham-flavored snack that 
turns most American stomachs.

The cafe’s claim to fame is flamenco, 
a musical genre that was born in Sevilla, 

Spain at the end of the 15th century. Once 
an obscure dance unknown outside its birth-
place, flamenco is undergoing a renaissance 
that Cafe Sevilla capitalizes on by bringing a 
bit of Spanish flair to San Diego.

Cafe Sevilla transports its guests to Spain 
the moment they walk through the door. 
The interior is reminiscent of the many 
sparse, cave-like bars that define the pub 
scene in Andalusia, the southern part of 
Spain. The building’s brick walls and ceil-
ing pipes are exposed, and packed-in tables 
that put diners within inches of each other. 
The main decorations are Picasso-inspired 
paintings that cover the walls. 

The Friday and Sunday flamenco shows, 
which place spectators right in the action at 
this crowded venue, are about $10 cheaper 
than the $47.50 Saturday Flamenco Gypsy 
Fusion dinner shows. But the hefty price is 
worth it: Josef, a musician from the Gipsy 
King Family, often plays guitar and sings 
his version of gypsy fusion, including many 
familiar songs from the Gipsy King’s collec-
tion. With sharp and emotionally charged 
gestures, dancers complement the serious 
but colorful flamenco-guitar music, experi-
menting with movement and channeling 
Middle Eastern elements (like using a sword 
as a dance prop) — showing that many cul-
tural influences define flamenco.

The show comes with a three-course 
meal, which includes flan and paella, a 
traditional Spanish dish of meat or seafood 
and rice. The authentic tapas and appetiz-
ers could be from any restaurant in Spain, 
with stuffed olives and tortilla Espanola as 
staples. No Spanish meal would be complete 

without a glass of sangria, and Cafe Sevilla 
offers Sangratini and Sangarita variations 
for adventurous diners. After the show, Cafe 
Sevilla transforms into a nightclub and din-
ner guests are invited to stick around, skip-
ping the lines and cover charges.

Because of the cafe’s location in down-
town San Diego’s bustling Gaslamp District, 
shows sell out regularly, so call early for 
reservations and tickets. Parking can be a 
hassle, especially on weekends, but Horton 

Plaza has free three hour parking with vali-
dation. Although Cafe Sevilla is more expen-
sive than most restaurants in Spain, the price 
is worth a night on the town and a truely 
authentic Spanish meal.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  9

Before I visited Qualcomm Stadium on Oct. 24, visions of Hurricane Katrina and the 
turmoil at the Louisiana Superdome 
in 2005 ignited my imagination, 
conjuring up the image of a stadium 
packed to the brim with evacuees, 
perhaps begging for water. So I pre-
pared myself for the worst, but in 
the only way I knew how: my cam-
era batteries were fully charged and 
I had enough memory cards to last 
me a week. If my digital single-lens 
reflex camera failed me, two film 
cameras backed me up. When I was 
ready, camera straps covered my 
chest like bandoliers.

But this was not 
Katrina. I was sur-
prised to encoun-
ter what looked 
more like a carni-
val than an emer-
gency shelter.

Previously, with 
the temperature 
well into the 90s, the fires seemed 
closer than they actually were. The 
smoky haze gave midday a sun-
set color and kept me expecting 
to see flames licking the nearest 
hillside. I had mostly stayed indoors 
since the fires broke out. Even the 
allure of taking awe-inspiring fire 
photos firsthand was not enough 
to get me to leave my apartment. 
By Oct. 24, I was still not happy 
about being outside, even though 
the photographer’s urge had caught 
up with me and I was eager to begin 
documenting some responses to the 
emergency.

In the early afternoon I arrived 
at Qualcomm with my camera gear 
and two grocery bags full of canned 
food to donate. Volunteers in the 
parking lot turned the food away 

— my first hint that the situation 
was not as dire as I had imagined. I 
was completely disarmed of my cri-
sis mentality the minute I stepped 
through the stadium entrance, 
where I saw kids jumping rope, 
volunteers hosting an improvisa-
tion show and still more volunteers 
carrying signs directing evacuees to 
massage and acupuncture booths. 
On a walk around the stadium’s 
ground level, I passed mountains 
of bottled water, heaps of donated 
clothing, children coloring, at least a 
dozen news crews replete with cam-
eras and reporters and even a couple 
of performers on stilts passing out 

candy. The stark 
contrast between 
my impression 
of the emergency 
up to that point 
and the positive 
frenzy within 
Qualcomm  was 
disorienting.

Leaving the ground floor of the 
stadium and heading to the upper 
decks gave me an idea of why this 
group required such extensive aid. 
Camping tents punctuated rows 
of unoccupied cots. Despite being 
bathed by the warm glow of sun-
set, they seemed cold and exposed. 
Compared to the bustling ground 
level they were almost unpopulated, 
but this made sense; Qualcomm 
held about 10,000 evacuees at its 
peak, but by the time I visited there 
were about 2,500 and the number 
was falling fast.

Indeed, by Oct. 26 they would all 
be relocated, regardless of whether 
they had a home to return to: the 
Chargers would play the Texans 
in the stadium on Oct. 28. In the 
uppermost seats, where I might oth-

erwise find dedicated fans cheering 
for a fourth-quarter comeback, I 
found a handful of people facing a 
blank field, with each person having 
one or two entire seating sections to 
themselves. 

While taking a picture of a tent 
facing the field, I noticed a woman 
sitting alone just a few seats away. 
I thought of asking for her story, 
but I realized that someone who 
has climbed to the top of an empty 
football stadium might just want 
to be alone. There are some things 
for which community outreach and 
free acupuncture just cannot offer 
solace.

It would be an understatement to 
say I was surprised by the success of 
so many volunteers raising the spir-
its of so many more evacuees. 

No photographer wants to pho-
tograph tragedy. It takes a lot of 
effort to come to terms with mak-
ing aesthetic choices and producing 
images of an individual’s often very 
personal suffering. To do this, pho-
tojournalists have to not only treat 
their subjects with respect, but also 
accept in their conscience that they 
are not just taking a picture from 
their subjects, but also giving them 
a voice and making their strife, joy 
or anger the concern of a larger, 
powerful public. 

Going to Qualcomm with the fear 
that I would have to shoulder a great 
burden in providing some outlet for 
these evacuees, I was relieved and 
exhilarated to photograph a group 
that had already been heard and 
answered by a community offering 
overwhelming support.

22 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007

Cowabunga DUDE!

PHOTOS BY KAREN LING/GUARDIAN
Top: A pie-eating contest winner shows off his 
prize and his sticky face. Bottom: Muir Surf and 
Sport offers a variety of merchandise, ranging 
from skateboards to sunglasses. Right: Muir 
Surf and Sport Team Manager Scott Lembach 
slides his skateboard at Mayhem at Muir II, a 
promotional event organized by both Lembach 
and the UCSD Skate Club.

T ucked away in the corner of John Muir College and down the steps beneath Sierra Summit is a col-
lege-campus rarity. There, one may 
find skate lessons being taught, guitar 
chords being strummed, boards being 
repaired or surf melodies softly sound-
ing from behind glass walls. 

There lies Muir Surf and Sport, 
UCSD’s two-year-old surf and skate 
hub and still the only board shop on 
any college campus in the nation. 
While the small-time shop may be dif-
ficult to locate,  it may be hard to leave 
once you get there.

It could be the rows of fluorescent-
colored wheels on the wooden skate-
board decks that draw people in, or 
perhaps the stylish apparel and gleam-
ing white surfboards that entice stu-
dents through the windows. Or maybe 
it’s the store’s ambiance, which wel-
comes people with its acoustic-heavy 
playlists, surf videos, orange swivel 
chairs and bright-faced staff.

The man behind the establishment, 
Scott Lembach, is an energetic sales-
man who moved from Baltimore in 
1997 to pursue the San Diego surfer’s 
lifestyle, Lembach was approached by 
Muir College Center Manager Vince 
Manson to compose a proposal to 
open a campus surf shop. Because a 
board-sports shop was among the top 
student requests for the vacant retail 
space, the college accepted Lembach’s 
proposal, and Muir Surf and Sport 
opened in September 2005. 

Now Lembach spends nearly all 
week in the shop, summer included, 
eagerly sharing his knowledge about 
his latest products and — if the tim-
ing is right — the incoming northwest 
swell. 

“This is my life,” Lembach said. “If 
I’m not working, I’m surfing, skating 

or snowboarding. It just happened to 
work out in my favor because I love 
what I’m doing.”

The goal of Muir Surf and Sport 
has always been to bring value to stu-
dents, said Lembach, who added that 
he seeks vendor discounts in order to 
offer products to students at affordable 
prices. The staff prides itself on below-
retail-value prices that help bring oft-
expensive action sports to the campus 
community.

A board shop seems like a natural fit 
for a campus dubbed the “Best School 
for Surfing” by Sports Illustrated, but 
catering to the average, academically 
focused UCSD student has proved 
challenging, according to Lembach.

“All that these kids have been doing 
their whole lives is studying,” he said. 
“When they get a skateboard, it chang-
es their lives.”

The shop’s obscure location and 
modest size, however, have been the 
toughest obstacles to confront. To max-
imize space within the 440-square-foot 
store, the staff built custom skateboard 
racks this year to lift the boards off the 
floor and place them at eye level. A 
new Web site was also created about 
six months ago to increase access and 
launch online sales. The shop now 
offers three new skateboard brands, 
along with the new Muir Surf and 
Sport brand.

With the exception of Lembach, 
Muir Surf and Sport is run by UCSD 
students and alumni. Among them 
are Muir College senior Marc Leglise 
as webmaster; Muir College junior 
Sergie Magdalin, who is the graphic 
art and design manager responsible for 
the new Muir Surf and Sport clothing 
and skateboard designs; and UCSD 
alumnus Matt Goldstone as the new 
co-manager, charged with updating the 

Web site, developing a new inventory 
system, managing daily operations and 
supervising the shop while Lembach 
takes his midday surf break.

Thurgood Marshall College senior 
Kristian Gustavson, Lembach’s room-
mate, points to his board-sport knowl-
edge and friendly attitude as reasons 
for the shop’s success.

“Scott understands students,” 
Gustavson said. “He’s out at the skate 
parks grinding, he’s out at Black’s drop-
ping into closed-out sets. The guy is 
crazy. He’s not a hypocritical owner 
like a lot of guys out there. He rips 
harder than most guys I know.”

Muir Surf and Sport is also focus-
ing on bringing the shop to students 
by holding five to six events every year 
while also increasing its presence in the 
San Diego community. 

Last week, Lembach and three 
UCSD seniors — Gustavson, Michael 
Almeida and Sasha Savanovic brought 
a minivan full of skateboards, shirts 
and stencils to Qualcomm Stadium and 
Steele Canyon High School evacuation 
centers to distract disillusioned evacu-
ees. Kids weaved through orange cones 
in competition for a new skateboard, 
parents and their children designed 
their own shirts and the shop gave away 
Muir Surf and Sport apparel.

Most people would say Lembach is 
just one of the kids, participating with 
the students at events. 

“I get caught in the middle and by 
the time I’m done, it’s over,” Lembach 
said Oct. 24 at Qualcomm, skateboard 
in hand. “The time has passed and I 
have the time of my life. I don’t even 
think about the business aspect of it.”

With a slew of upcoming events, a new Web site and an 
enthusiastic owner, Muir Surf and Sport is making waves.

The Cool Kids
■ “Black Mags”
CHOCOLATE INDUSTRIES

I f you thought the Trunk Boiz’ YouTube hit “Scraper Bikes” was the only example of rappers expressing their newfound love for 
bikes, you are sorely mistaken. Chicago hipster-
hoppers the Cool Kids hit the cyber-streets with 
this ode to BMX bikes with 3-Spoke Mag rims 
— and though they lack the Trunk Boiz’ DIY 
work ethic, these Kids are significantly more 
talented on the mic. They rap exclusively over 
bass-heavy, old-school beats (“Ride past shorty 
light-skinned no melanin/ Shirt look like some-
body stuck two melons in”), and, perhaps more 
importantly, dress like they’re straight off the set 
of “Do The Right Thing.”

Check out their low-budget music video 
online to find out just how cool they can be. 
Trust me — you’ll end up running straight to 
the swap meet to cop some Starter caps of your 
own.

Wu-Tang Clan
feat. Erykah Badu
■ “The Heart Gently Weeps”
WU-TANG RECORDS

T he Clan with Witty Unpredictable Talent and Natural Game is back! Well, almost. Only Ghostface, 
Raekwon and Method Man turn up 
for this White Album-snatching, slow-
going RZA track, but each MC brings 
enough ruckus to make up for the 
members that didn’t show — Ghostface 
especially. The only flaw in this dart is 
Erykah Badu’s fluffy chorus, a pretty 
underwhelming variation of the origi-
nal George Harrison take.

8 Diagrams, the first Wu album since 
2001, drops Dec. 11 — pushed back 
a week to appease a bitter Ghostface, 
whose seventh album was set to hit 
shelves the same day.

Messy Marv feat. Mac Dre
■ “My Life’s Like a Movie”
SCALEN

I f rappers learned anything from Tupac, it’s that productivity is incredibly important. The more prolific you are, the easier it is to release 
music — even while you’re in jail, or if you hap-
pen to get killed (sorry, but it’s true). “My Life’s 
Like a Movie” is a wonderful example of this 
phenomenon. 

Though Messy Marv is in jail for probably 
the third time in as many years, and the third 
anniversary of Mac Dre’s untimely death is Oct. 
31, we’re now handed a fresh track from the two 
of them, off Marv’s upcoming Draped Up and 
Chipped Out Vol. 2.

On a separate note, it’s always amusing to 
see which Bay Area rapper will ditch his hyphy 
upbringings next. Despite the fact that he’s rap-
ping alongside hyphy pioneer Mac Dre, Marv 
tries to claim that “all that funny-ass dancing 
ain’t what my niggas ’bout.” Really?

Jay-Z feat. Ja Rule
■ “Can I Get a Remix”
TAPEMASTERS INC.

F ans are waiting for Jay-Z’s American Gangster (Nov. 6), modeled after the upcoming Denzel Washington flick, like crackheads awaiting a re-up. So sure, let’s 
feed that already fat Beyonce retirement fund by sitting 
tight for film-inspired tracks about crack-dealing, cor-
ner-grinding and the conventional gamut of gangster-
ism — or not. 

Available now is Tapemasters Inc.’s mixtape vari-
ant, dubbed The Mixtape Reloaded, which revisits and 
remixes the grandest hits from Hova’s history. The 
rethought classics are often more refreshing than Jay-Z’s 
latest material, especially the Basshedz-produced “Can 
I Get A… ,” a romping renovation of the 1998 hit. The 
track remembers Jay-Z at his smoothest lyrical peak, 
heavy handclaps and stomp-beats flashing us back to 
the high school bleachers where this classic was made 
legendary. And thankfully cut from the latter-day ver-
sion is Amil, so we can leave her diva demand hanging: 
“How we gonna get around on your bus pass?”

ARTPOWER! IN REVIEW

FAR from HOME
MOUNTAIN MUSICIANS RECREATE THEIR DAILY
ANTICS FOR AN ENVELOPING AUDITORIUM

By Simone Wilson
Hiatus Editor

F riday before last, on the verge of a weekend that would set the San Diego countryside ablaze 
and displace hundreds of its inhabit-
ants, the musicians of Virginia’s leg-
endary Hwy. 58 (or, more sentimen-
tally, its Crooked Road) took the 
low-lit Mandeville stage, awkward 
through introductions and stiffly 
scripted back-stories. The clammy 
sidenotes to their traveling road-
show — which, thanks to the tal-
ent-sniffers at ArtPower!, took its 
very first pitstop at UCSD — gave 
us spectators a hyper-awareness 
of our own location and their 
contrasting displacement, this 
far-off band of locals on a his-
tory-lesson crusade through 

the States, a noisy travel brochure for 
southwestern Virginia. Thick mountain 
accents reported an unmatchable legacy 
of handed-down folk songs, explained 
bluegrass’ African roots in the blues 
and declared the music of their dearest 
backcountry more than a genre or art 
form — more a way of life.

And that is musically apparent from 
the get-go. Nineteen-year-old tradi-
tionalist Elizabeth LaPrelle devotes her 
life and voice, with an eerily antique 
strength and twang, to preserving the 
original lyrics (many of which are, 
somewhat humorously, directed from a 
male suitor to his chosen maiden) and 
replicating the precise delivery meth-
ods of her ancestral countryfolk. The 
small, starkly plain college girl stood as 
an interactive piece in a regional muse-
um, lending labored authen-
ticity to the fiddles 

and banjos and bass plods of her fellow 
Virginia players, who seemed more 
interested in acheiving new levels of 
string-blurring virtuosity.

One of these male instrumentalists 
— Eddie Bond, certainly the showman 
of the bunch — used small-town anec-
dotes like the teenage complaint-song 
“Furniture Factory Blues” to set the 
scene for us West-Coast foreigners, 
even showing off a nimble-footed jig 
and multitasking as a feisty vocalist 
from atop the chin-rest of a fiddle the 
size of one lung. Eddie would later 
join award-winning banjo whiz 

How to gather a group of education-wary college students for a Thursday 
night of lecture, on the classical traditions of 18th- and 
19th-century France? Throw in a little free food — or better 
yet, a barrelful of wine! After a few glasses through the sprightly, for-
mal talents of the history-illustrating Paris Piano Trio, you’ll no doubt 
understand how the burgandy-lipped French bourgeoisie enjoyed their 
instrumental and agricultural studies so heartily. Taste of Art: Wines of 
France will take place at Wine Steals in Point Loma on Nov. 8.

Going down right here in our own International Center, a skirted Islamic troupe of traditional Whirling Dervishes is set to whip up

grape-leaf rolls — with a holy channeling of all that revolves,

ture points with a pre-performance ArtTalk.

“We Own The Night”
LA JOLLA VILLAGE CINEMAS / NOW PLAYING

Filling the crime void left by “The Departed” (at 
least until “American Gangster”) is James Gray’s tale of 
one family’s ties to both sides of the law — one brother 
(Mark Wahlberg) has followed in the family footsteps 
to become a respected NYPD officer, while the other 
(Joaquin Phoenix) manages a popular night club that 
doubles as a drug-running front for the mob. Life paths 
and allied interests inevitably collide in what’s more 
of a popcorn flick than the study of violence that was 
Scorsese’s modern classic, but “Night” is the best bet 
for those who can’t go another minute without a highly 
stylized shootout or bullet-riddled corpse. (CM)

Lars may be borderline agoraphobic and more social-
ly repressed than a UCSD undergrad, but true love is just 
a click away when the introvert discovers a Web site that 
ships anatomically correct girlfriends on the overnight 
express. So she doesn’t speak English, can’t walk and, oh 
yeah, is made entirely of plastic. Maybe she’s the perfect 
woman. But is she the right one for Lars?

The premise is a little absurd: One shy young man 
orders a sex doll off the Internet, introducing her to 
friends and family as his girlfriend, a paraplegic 
Brazilian/Danish missionary. But it’s pulled off 
with such unflinching sincerity and deadpan 
poise that we can’t help but take it seriously; 
in fact, “Lars and the Real Girl” is often 
touching and constantly funny, its rare mix 
of guilty chuckles and laugh-out-loud 
tragedies intricately woven by the 
brilliant screenwriting of Nancy 
Oliver (HBO original series 
“Six Feet Under”) and

16  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007

Sammy Shelor — a lumbering man 
with fingers like hummingbirds — and 
a gang of reliable neighors suited in 
plaid, never without their trusty wood-
en counterparts, for an outback string 
symphony that attempted to recreate the 
kind of impromptu community pluckin’ 
that one might encounter on a Virginia 
roadside. Similarly, the Whitetop 
Mountain Band, a family affair with an 
almost overloaded platter of versatility, 
set out to show the SoCal intellectu-
als how a rip-roarin’ Christmas party 
goes down at the Spencer household. 
All the community members professed 
mutual admiration, bounced anecdotal 
wisecracks off one another and often 
stepped in when an extra set of strings 
was needed to round out the almost 
circus-like bandwagon. 

It’s understandably difficult for such 
musically instinctual people to put into 
dry speech the kind of togetherness they 
feel and the ties they feel to Virginia’s 
history-rich soil; but even their unfail-
ing virtuosity and joyousness in per-
formance maintained the transplanted 
air of someone else’s local love. Sure, 
our own Crooked Road is a five-lane 
highway touring a sea of sprawling 
mansions, but with or without a fam-
ily-owned banjo shopt, the ArtPower! 
import gave us a new awareness of our 
own ties — an intimacy all humans 
form with the land that holds them.

Sunset Rubdown
■ Random Spirit Lover
JAGJAGUWAR

O nce upon a time, a Canadian singer named Spencer Krug traveled the world defeating things of winged and wicked nature, riding 
his stallion across the land in search of hunters 
and the diamonds they carried. He and his band 
of merry companions, together called Sunset 
Rubdown, documented their journey in Random 
Spirit Lover using only the instruments on their 
backs.

Their journey began abruptly one morning 
when the quartet awoke to a jaunty guitar riff 
accompanied by staccato piano known as “The 
Mending of the Gown,” which lacked nuance 
but served as an adequate wake-up call, dense 
with mythical imagery. They knew it was time to 
leave for the ocean where the hunters dwelled, so 
Krug quickly gave a toast; he said, “This one’s for 
Maggie, and this one’s for Sam,” and the adven-
ture could begin.

As Sunset Rubdown bushwhacked through the 
backwoods of empty kingdoms, “Magic vs. Midas” 
reminded them to take the occasional break and 
count their lucky stars. They sat in a circle, gently 

strumming bonfire acoustics and exploring Casio 
pads that suited their off-kilter renaissance bal-
ladry. Once dawn faded into morning, the caravan 
resumed its brisk pace, yodeling various accusa-
tions at each other over synth and glockenspiel, 
then autoharping themselves to tropical villages 
in “For the Pier (and Dead Shimmering),” until 
finally they tired and set up camp near a local 
theatre troupe by the coast.

It was opening night, so the band took their 
seats far from the stage and complemented the 
actors with drum rolls and dissonant shrieks 
both electric and organic, which the audience 
adored. But once Spencer and his friends reached 
the hunters’ ocean caves, they did not find any 
diamonds. For the last time, the group huddled 
together and passed around an acoustic guitar, 
ending their journey on a somber note. Spencer 
was determined to return after another season of 
honing his craft, older and wiser.

Britney Spears
■ Blackout
JIVE RECORDS

D ear God, could it be true? Could the tabloid mess that is Britney Spears actually produce a compact disc fit for more than propping 
open doors at a future ‘00s party? Spears’ fourth 
release, coming after a four-year musical void, is 
the booty-shaking electro-pop delight we wanted 
to expect from the former teen queen and her win-
ning entourage: production giants the Neptunes 
and Timbaland protege Nate “Danjahandz” 
Hills (who also worked on Justin Timberlake’s 
FutureSex/LoveSounds). Blackout is packed with 
12 tracks as danceable as they are dumb, a musical 
Candyland in which Spears’ digitized vocal chords 
take a backseat to her infamous vagina, thrust to 
the forefront of just about every song.

“Taste it/ I’ll make sure you eat every crumb 
off the plate,” she moans on “Kiss You All Over,” 
one of many pussy-love sermons in her brow-
raising sexual buffet, oozing innuendo and wish-
ful lust. Though the hot body that once backed 
the lyrics has since grown a little chub, the blatant 
lie behind her latest batch of songs doesn’t dis-
pel any of Britney’s magic. Her limited soprano 
whine and forced husk are so expertly spliced 
and chopped within the club bang of every track 

(save for “Hot as Ice,” where the whine finally 
manages to conquer all) that in the end, Spears is 
actually triumphed by her own music, one more 
degrading thrill on her long list of charming 
shortcomings.

Born of machine, man and controlled sub-
stances, Blackout is a hyper dance experience in 
the vein of Madonna’s Confessions on a Dance 
Floor, but without the flirty innovation that earned 
Spears her guilty-pleasure throne. Despite a limp 
disposition and oft-nauseating Mickey Mouse 
pitch, Spears’ pervading train-wreck magnetism 
— along with some shining neo-hip-hop synths, 
on which Brit-Brit even attempts to rap (not 
nearly as scary as it sounds) — will ensure her a 
spot in clubs around the world for years to come. 
To hell with the critics — she’ll just pop a Cheeto 
in her mouth and use the stack of reviews to wipe 
up her spilt Slurpee. Because the notorious Spears 
has proved herself humanity’s equivalent to a 
roach: No nuclear bomb nor hateful headline 
can stop her.

‘Notebook’ Romantic Works His 
Charms for Mail-Order Love

Cult ‘Office’ Comedian Trades 
‘Real Life’ for Sugary Smarm

“Fracture” and “Half Nelson”). When Lars asks his brother 
Gus (Paul Shneider) to accommodate Bianca while she 
visits, he quickly takes her in — after all, it wouldn’t be 
prudent to share a room out of wedlock — and sets up 
an appointment with Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson), 
the local shrink, who advises everyone to play along 
until Lars is ready for the truth.

And so they do. From there, it’s a journey 
through the usual maze of any relationship: 
Bianca sleeps in the guest room while Lars 
lives in the garage, and she volunteers 
at the children’s center when he’s 
away at work. But at the heart 
of the film is the way Lars’ 
family and small town cater 
to his illusions. They push 
her wheelchair, dress and 
bathe her — even elect her 
to the school board, all for 
the sake of a shy little man 
in desperate need of love. 
They see a friend who’s 
sick and do everything in 
their power to help him, 
no matter how hard it is 
to keep a straight face. It’s 
thrilling to find a major 
motion picture that can 
carry a premise belong-
ing in a Saturday Night 
Live skit to such earnest 
depths, yet still wade in a 
sea of humor.

As the whole com-
munity begins to take 
part in Lars’ delusion, the 
film’s focus turns away 
from the elephant in the 
room — a silicone doll in 
fishnet stockings — to the 
obvious pain that underpins 
Lars’ descent into fantasy. If 
Gosling had let up for even an 
instant, the movie’s delicate spell 
would shatter. Instead, his affection for 
Bianca, played by a lovely Nordstrom’s man-
nequin, is so genuine that the elephant only 
rears its head when, in perfect comedic timing, 
the surrounding characters have to stop and 
remind themselves of the absurdity of it all.

▶ LARS, from page 11
breakfast dishes — even supports girlfriend 
swaps for the greater good of the film. Superb 
acting by Ma and Pa (Diane Wiest and John 
Mahoney) still can’t make this Betty Crocker 
story ring true. Who are these people? Where 
the hell were they exported from, and can 
somebody please take them back? 

Donning the guise of lonely widower who 
embarks on an insipid journey of romantic 
shenanigans with his brother’s (Dane Cook) 
special lady (Juliette Binoche), Steve Carell plays 
Dan Burns, father to three rather demanding 
girls for spawn of a single parent. Famed for his 
schticky inability to “get some” and magnificent 
awkwardness ’round the office, Carell is a toned-
down clone of his previous roles — falling into 
the Ben Stiller trap, he hits a character-acting 
wall, playing variations of either the tensely 
geeky middle-ager or the placid average Joe. 
Both are visible in Dan Burns, king of neutral-
ity, a guy so repressed he makes Bea Arthur 
look wild. Even when he manages to sneak in a 

Michael Scott quip or 
two (“Put it on my 

tab”), it seems 
more like a 

s h o u t -

out to “Office” fans than a valid line of dialogue 
for dull-ass Dan.

There are, however, moments of genuine 
shock and speckles of fun. After all, director 
Peter Hedges is a veteran of troubled family 
flicks, helming movies like “Pieces of April” and 
“What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?” This could be 
why “Dan” feels a lot deeper then it is, gripping 
its moody and uncomfortable tone more tighly 
with each passing scene. Each character’s pal-
pable discomfort evokes a much gentler “Family 
Stone,” at times even suggesting that Sarah 
Jessica Parker will wasp into the room with her 
uncomfortable clam-throat. It’s this gentleness 
that detracts from the film’s overall memorabil-
ity, with most genuine awkwardness replaced by 
a Debbie-Downer solemnity.

Predictably, “Dan” doesn’t really explore any 
new cinematic territory — given, it was made 
in the spirit of light entertainment — and ends 
up enjoyable for no other reason than its abil-
ity to minimize Dane Cook’s screen time. Sure, 
everyone knows how it’s going to end: Somehow 
all these people will learn some valuable lesson, 
and blah blah blah — but at least it doesn’t get 
all up in our faces with noise-based comedy, a 
method Cook has more than mastered. No, that’s 
a stomach ache for another day.

20  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007



MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  23

UCSD led 25-22 in game one but 
allowed the Broncos to go on a six-
point run to give them a 28-26 advan-
tage. Cal Poly Pomona completed the 
comeback in game one on a Triton 
error. 

Again with the late advantage in 
game two at 25-21, the Tritons opened 
the door for the Broncos, who walked 
in and tied the game at 26. UCSD 
scored three straight to regain the lead 
but the Broncos staved off the loss with 
four straight points to give themselves 
a game point 30-29. But the Tritons 
didn’t give up the comeback this time 
as junior outside hitter Rebecca Bailey 
tied the game with a kill, and kills by 
senior outside hitter Casey Wilson and 
senior opposite Amber Ries finished 
a nerve-racking game two win for 
UCSD.

According to Black, the Broncos’ 
enthusiastic fans rattled the Tritons, 
but UCSD was able to tune out the 
distractions.

“I think the crowd got us in the first 
game,” Black said. “We leveled out after 
that and it was a battle.”

Games three and four were less-
than-stellar performances by both 
teams in their respective losses. Cal 
Poly Pomona dominated game three 
leading by as many as 11 points before 
claiming the win. UCSD bounced back 
in game four leading 20-12 and cruis-
ing to the win, forcing that decisive 
game five. 

With their adrenaline pumping, the 
Tritons kept their emotions in check 
and stormed out to a 13-10 lead in 
game five. But two points away from 
the victory, Cal Poly Pomona ended 
the match and the comeback with a 
five-point run that left the Tritons in 
shock.

“We made some errors on our side 
of the court,” Bailey said. “Having a 
three-, four- or five-point lead can go 
quickly in a fifth game. We didn’t blow 
them off, but we didn’t take them as 
seriously as we should have.”

After taking such a draining defeat 
the night before, UCSD muscled the 
courage to head into conference-
unbeaten Cal State San Bernardino 
and pull of an improbable comeback 
win: 23-30, 13-30, 30-25, 30-27, 15-12.

The Tritons started off slow in 
games one and two, looking like a team 
that had just played a tiring five-game 
match the night before. The Coyotes 
jumped ahead early and often, never 
allowing UCSD take the lead in either 
of the first two games.

“We made a lot of unforced errors 
on our side,” sophomore outside hitter 
Sylvia Schmidt said. “Natalie [Facchini] 
had a serving run that really put us 
in a good position. We were embar-
rassed those first two games but we 
came back out with pride and started 
executing.”

UCSD finally gained its first lead 
of the match in game three at 17-15, 
and the lead stretched to 27-20 after 
aggressive serving by junior defensive 
specialist Michelle Torres. Cal State 
San Bernardino fought back with a 
five-point run, but sophomore middle 
blocker Sylvia Schmidt ended the game 
with a pair of kills.

With momentum shifting in favor 
of the Tritons, the Coyotes battled 
back to an early 10-4 advantage in 
game four. The lead carried to 25-20 
before UCSD took control. Following 
a Coyote error, UCSD recorded a pair 
of blocks and kills to take a 28-27 
lead. Coming out of a Cal State San 
Bernardino timeout, UCSD scored a 
triple block, supplemented by another 
Schmidt kill, to give the Tritons the 
game.

The Tritons fell behind early again 
in game five but grew stronger after 
back-to-back kills by Schmidt and 
Bailey. Up 8-6, Torres served up an 
ace and Schmidt tallied a block and a 
kill, and the teams exchanged points to 
push the score to 14-12. Schmidt once 
again rose to the occasion and finished 
off the Coyotes with an emphatic kill 
to seal the Tritons’ victory.

UCSD’s win may have seemed 
unlikely on the heels of the preced-
ing night’s disappointing loss, but the 
Tritons rallied and played together to 
get back on track.

“I don’t know if all the girls came 
in thinking they could win,” Black 
said. “But we had a gut check after 
game two and we all got on the same 
page. [Cal State San Bernardino] is as 

good as any team in the country and 
I’m proud of the girls for how they 
responded.”

Schmidt came up huge for the 
Tritons in pressure situations at the 
end of games and finished with 16 
kills. Bailey led the team with 19 and 
Ries added 13.

Next up for UCSD is a road match 
against Humboldt State on Nov. 2.

Volleyball to Host Two Final Games Before Playoffs
▶ VOLLEYBALL, from page 24

As a team, the Tritons combined 
for an identical 295, totaling 590 for 
the day. Phan put himself in medalist 
contention with a three-under-par 
69. The other Triton golfers played 
well, but couldn’t turn in the same 
impressive performance as Phan. 

“Nathan is in his third year and 
hasn’t played up to his standards 
before this year,” Wydra said. “Ever 
since the final round 68 during 
regionals last year, he has been play-
ing really well and striking the ball 
beautifully.”

Phan cooled down during the final 
round with a three-over 75 to finish 
even for the tournament. Juniors Ryan 
Bailey and Billy Olsen and freshman 
Bryan Olshock rounded out the other 
UCSD competitors, finishing 42nd, 
43rd, and 45th respectively.

Overall, Wydra was pleased with 
the team’s performance, considering 
the circumstances at home.

“The previous event we averaged 
just over 300 and we got that num-
ber down to 295 this week,” he said. 
“We didn’t putt terribly well and had 
we, the scores would’ve reflected 
that. But they’re getting into the 
season now.”

Next up for UCSD is the Mauna 
Lani Invitational from Oct. 29 
through Oct. 30 in Hawaii. The 
invitational marks the end of the 
Tritons’ fall season, as the team 
won’t see tournament action until 
February. 

Four of the five members com-
peting this week haven’t competed in 
Hawaii before. According to Wydra, 
the Bermuda grass makes the greens 
in Hawaii very difficult to read but 
he believes that with such a talented 
and advanced group, they should 
adapt quickly and perform well.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2007

By Janani Sridharan
Staff Writer 

After a week of disrupted prac-
tices due to the San Diego fires, the 
No. 14 UCSD men’s water polo team 
faced No. 10 Loyola Marymount 
University on Oct. 27 in its final 
game against a Western Water Polo 
Association opponent before the con-
ference championships from Nov. 16 
through Nov. 18. The Tritons started 
the game strongly, but fell behind in 
the second half to take the 9-4 loss, 
which dropped their record to 10-13 
for the season. 

The Tritons were unable get into a 
pool to practice Monday, Tuesday and 
Wednesday last week because the air 
quality was deemed unhealthy, and the 
team’s rustiness was evident in its loss.

“For the first part of the week, we 
couldn’t do anything,” senior two-
meter Simon Schafer said. “LMU 
offered us pool time, but the north-
bound I-5 was closed. We made the 
decision to drive up on Thursday 
morning to practice at LMU.” 

The Tritons practiced at Loyola 
Marymount University for three days 
leading up to the game.

The game began well for the 
Tritons with junior driver Chance 
Vermilyea opening up the game’s 
scoring with a counterattack goal 
midway through the first quarter. 

However, the Lions answered with 
1 minute, 47 seconds left in the first 
quarter to tie the game.

The Lions carried their momen-
tum into the second quarter, scoring 
and putting UCSD in a 3-1 hole. 
The Tritons responded with a goal 
from sophomore two-meter Daniel 
Garcia to keep the game close, trail-
ing Loyola Marymount by just one 
goal going into halftime. 

The third quarter proved to be the 
game’s deciding period as the Lions 
scored three unanswered goals in the 
quarter to take a 6-2 lead, putting 
UCSD in an ultimately insurmount-
able hole.

According to Schafer, the Lions 
pulled away by making the most of 
several costly errors by the Tritons.

“There were just a few minutes 
in the third quarter where we went 
from being down by one goal to being 
down by four goals,” he said. “We 
made a series of mistakes and [LMU] 
took advantage of its opportunities 
while we didn’t capitalize on ours.”

The Tritons added scores from 
sophomore utility Ian Bausback and 
Schafer in the fourth quarter but it 
wasn’t enough for UCSD as Loyola 
Marymount scored three more times 
in the period to give the Lions a 9-4 
win. 

The Tritons struggled on their 
six-on-five opportunities throughout 
the game, converting on only one of 
eight chances.

Their limited pool time for the 
week may have had an effect on the 
Tritons’ poor man-up play.

“We weren’t able to practice any 
water polo plays early in the week,” 
Bausback said. “We couldn’t work on 
our 6-on-5 man-up offense, which 

hurt us.”
In addition to hindering UCSD’s 

ability to work on its plays, the fires’ 
impacts stole some of the Tritons’ 
momentum from their strong game 
against UC Davis the previous week.

The Tritons hoped to return to 
Canyonview Pool on Oct. 28 for prac-
tice, but were still awaiting approval 
regarding air quality.

UCSD will face No. 4 UCLA at 
home on Nov. 3 in its first of three 
games against Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation opponents before 

the WWPA championships. After 
their game against UCLA, the Tritons 
will be on the road against No. 9 UC 
Irvine on Nov. 7 and No. 5 Pepperdine 
University on Nov. 10. 

“I think [the game against UCLA] 
is going to be a great opportunity to 
come together and eliminate some of 
our mistakes,” Bausback said. “We’re 
excited to play UCLA and other high-
caliber team MPSF teams.”

Even though the Tritons will be 
using these three games as prepara-
tion for the WWPA championships, 

they are also looking to get back on 
the winning track and end their four-
game skid. 

“We are capable of mounting an 
attack on a great team like UCLA and 
we’re not going to back down,” Schafer 
said. “We’re not expecting to lose.”

After hosting No. 4 UCLA on  
Nov. 3, the Tritons will not get a break 
from ranked opponents as they finish 
the regular season. They will take to 
the road for their final two games 
aginst No. 9 UC Irvine on Nov. 7 and 
No. 5 Pepperdine on Nov. 10.

Just when it seems the UCSD wom-
en’s volleyball team has all its parts 
functioning as a unit, it hits a bump. 
Rather than falling apart, however, 
the 2007 Tritons always seem to rally, 
and this weekend’s upset of No. 2 Cal 
State San Bernardino was the perfect 
example.

Heading into arguably its tough-
est three-game stretch, UCSD downed 
No. 19 Chico State at home on Oct. 20 
in a powerful sweep. Hoping to ride 
the high from that victory, the Tritons 
packed their bags and headed on the 
road into hostile territory Oct. 27 at 
Cal Poly Pomona and Oct. 28 at No. 
2 Cal State San Bernardino. Two more 
wins, and the Tritons would solidify 
themselves as title contenders.

However, the Tritons suffered a 
heartbreaking five-game loss to Cal 
Poly Pomona. They were able to 
rebound with a five-game comeback 
win against Cal State San Bernardino. 
The topsy-turvy results have left the 
team in a state of wonder, and at 10-5 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Conference and 16-7 overall, the play-
ers are ignoring talk of inconsistency.

“You have to take the season in 
halves,” head coach Tom Black said. 
“Experience is experience and we were 
trying to find our line up during the 
first half. Sure the Pomona loss was 
disappointing, but you can’t say we’re 
inconsistent. We had a lead in the fifth 
and let it slip away. We’ve played really 
well the last seven games and these 
girls are a special team.”

The Tritons had their chances in 
the 30-28, 30-32, 30-21, 18-30, 15-13 
loss to Cal Poly Pomona, posting leads 
in games one and five, but were unable 
to finish in both cases.

M. Golf Places Seventh at 
Sonoma State Invitational
By Matt Croskey
Staff Writer

The UCSD men’s golf team 
improved on its season-opening fin-
ish, taking seventh at the Sonoma 
State Invitational that took place just 
north of San Francisco from Oct. 22 
through Oct. 23.

While the wildfires raged through 
Southern California, canceling sports 
events across the region, the Tritons 
escaped to safer territory and tried 
not to let the disaster at home affect 
their focus.

“It would be a lie to say that 
the fires had a bad effect on us,” 
head coach Mike Wydra said. “Both 
Nathan Phan’s and my family were 
evacuated so we didn’t know if our 
homes were still there. But we’re not 
going to use that as an excuse.”

Junior Nathan Phan was able to 
put the disaster to the back of his 
mind and focus on his task at hand. 
He fired rounds of 72-69-75 for an 
even-par 216 total and was UCSD’s 

top individual. His 15th-place finish 
was supported by a 21st-place finish 
by sophomore Austin Alfonso, who 
shot a five-over-par 221. 

The Tritons opened up round one 
on Oct. 22, posting a team total of 
295 on the 6,711-yard Santa Rosa 
Golf and Country Club. Phan led 
the way with his even-par 72. Even 
though the conditions were difficult, 
the low scores were out there.

“This tournament was changed 
from the spring to fall because the 
course doesn’t drain well,” Wydra 
said. “It got about a half inch of rain 
before the tournament so the course 
was very soft. The greens were in 
good shape and we played lift, clean 
and place both days. Anytime you 
put your hands on the ball it becomes 
easier to shoot those low scores.”

After the grueling first 18 holes, 
UCSD and the other nine squads 
headed back out for second-round 
action.
