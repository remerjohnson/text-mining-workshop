Most of the programs represented at 
Quest International '86 are associated with 
the OAP. OAP is more varied in 
comparison to EAP, which is the type of 
program most students think of when

hiS cruCIal lounding role in the school's early years Ot 
everyone, however, knows Just how a tive " role he continues 
tll play. for example. as chairman of the Carbon DiOXide F'ancl, 
Revelle attends many internation;11 meetings concerned With 
climate ch,\I1ges 111 the world's oceans. He attended su h

Revelle's broad range of expertise and sympath ies arc all 
natural offshoots of his essential concern about the eart h's

he said, even after taking into conSideration an explodll1g

The historic chance that never appeared 
The Reagan Adm inistra tion's continued abysmal a tte mpts to dupe th e 

W estern world into bel ieving it is seriously pursuing a n adm ira ble arms control 
agreement with the Sovie t Union has never been illuminated m o re than at last 
weeke nd 's summ it in Iceland . 

testing m o ratori um and to continue to h onor the viability of the SALT II 
agreement. 

Both the U.S. a nd L...S. S.R. have claimied that the other has violated almost 
every arms-control agreement reached since the Cuban Missile Crisis, with 
SALT II being no exception . The U .S. though , even while lauding Soviet 
violations of SALT II since Reagan's inauguration in 1980, had continued to 
vocally honor me agreement until last summer. At that time, George Shultz and 
Donald Regan began making noises about abandoning the SALT 11 limitations 
b y placing more warheads on the missles in the trident submarines. 

As ill-prepared for serious n egotiation a s the Ameri can contingent was a t the 
stan of m e summit, George Shultz and company effec tively tri cked the mass 
media into p ortraying the Administration to be on the verge of compro m ising 
its usua lly intra n sigent p osi tion o n the virtue of a nuclear build -up . But, true to 
form , Ronald Reagan a nd friend s backed away from a historic o pportunity to 
curtail the world 's nuclear nightma re and went home to hold m ore 
disin formative p ress con ferences. 

Many eons ago, 111 the year 1983 B.5.D.1. ( Before th e Strategic Defense 
Initiative), President Reagan was under an en ormous amount of pressure fro m 

ATO, Congress, the American public, and the rest of the ration al world to 
enter IntO well-Illtentioned and comprehensive negotiations wi th the U.S.S. R. 
over a bilateral nuclear weapons reduction plan . With a new, a n d periodically 
refreshIng Soviet premier on the horizon, Mikhail Gorbachev, it ap peared as if 
the Politburo was growing tired of its old land-based missiles, and were willi ng 
to trade them off. 

The U.S. public and Congress qUickly cried foul , and President Reagan 
acceded to demands to honor the agreement at least until the time when h e 
could negotiate a new and better one . But all the hyperbole surrounding last 
year's Gorbachev-Reagan summit died down b y this Fall , a s did any real 
support for Sta r Wars from the respected science community. 

The U.S. Itself had stopped defending the cost-effectiveness, let alone 
usefulness , of our Virtually immobile missles , whIch rot away all over middle 
America, and it seemed as if at least a small, preliminary deal could be struck. 
The devilishly conservative hawks at the Pentagon and the White House (i.e . 
the Joint ChIefs of Staff, Caspar Weinberger, and Donald Regan) k new, 
however, that one deal begets another. They realized, and correctly so, that if 
mey did not find a new wrench to throw into the arms-control agenda , that 
soon the world would be demanding that the U .S. and the U.5.S.R. find a way 
to ehminate theIr entire nuclear arse nals . That would mean, of course, that aU 
those outrageously expensive pet projects of doom would come u nder attack 
once again, and be subject to elimination . Thus was born the Strategic Defe nse 
Initiative (Star Wars). 

The StrategIc Defense Initiative has been , since its conception , a strategical 
black h ole . Althoug h no reputable m e mber of th e p eri ls o f scie nce has ever 
been ab le to prove that it is poss ible to develop a foolproof, accurate laser 
s h ield in th e sky capable of d estroyi ng hundreds of nuclear missiles JUSt as 
they take off from the gro und, the Reaga n Administration h as pressed on , 
throWi ng millions of dollars into sta r wars research . Moreover, eve n th oug h 
these millions h ave produced nothing in th e way of a major technological 
advancem e nt, th e Ad ministration decid ed fro m Day O ne that 501 d e velo pment 
would n Ot be used as a bargain ing c hip during negotia tio ns. This posi tio n , 
which is bette r d escribed as a techno logical facad e, h as sabotaged the p otential 
for a n ew treaty. 

Arms-control critics will claim that th e Soviets h ave been d eveloping m ei r 
own ve rs io n of Star W ars for the p ast 15 years, a nd that they will o nly trade o ff 
weaponry tha t is becoming increasingly ant iqua ted . Be that as it may, the 
Iceland Summit p resented some very real opportunities to get rid of the old 
a rmor a nd begin discussing ways o f limiting m e n ew. 

One way to begin that process would have been for Reagan to agree to 
Gorbachev's proposal to cut both countries' offensive nuclear arsenals by 50 
percent and then work out a separate agreement on limiting SOl-type research 
o n both sidt:s. Instead , Reagan said , "no way," and would not even discuss it 

The threat of a conscientious public fo rCing a preSide nt 10 n egotiate awa y a 
multi-billion-dollar d efe n se industry wi th the h a teful Sovie ts was too muc h for 
the Pentagon . Even if th e Soviets we re serious about forging a series of 
mutually verifiable treaties with th e U .S. -and we may n ever know if they were-
the Pentagon a nd its favo rite adm in istra tion n ever really con sidered tha t any 
agreeme nt th at could be reached would be worthwhile in the lo ng run . Thi s 
sad reality has been quite a pparent over the pas t 17 m onths, in which the 
Reagan Administration had a chanc e to meet Gorbach ev's unilate ral nu lear-

ow, no one knows when , or if, there will be anomer summit, or such a 
willing Gorbachev to negotiate with. We all know , however, that the nuclear 
build -up will continue, a s will the dis informarive press conferences with the 
s miling President claiming progress, and the public shuddering with the 
knowledge that only manipulators make something OUt 01 nothing.

Whose ROTC? 
Editor: 

In the Thursday, October 9, 
1986 Issue 0 The Guardian rhe 
editOrial "The Enforcers 
Challenge Enforcement" 
discussed military recruitment on 
campus, speCifi cally In regards to 
rhe :o.!avy and Alrforce R O.T C 's 
Referendum ,:;3 In la t spring's 
elemon and the role of the AS. 
Council on rhls Issue has forced 
me to respond . 

In lasr Sprl ng's e1emon 
referendum ::3 read ' "Do you 
~uppon the ending of dm:lI or 
indirect u-;c of Regi;rrau(ln and 
Actl\'lty Fcc., for ol1-L..Impu,> 
recruitment of the milltal) . UA 
1:\'0 the "'':LrCt St.'rVlle <md the 
f'BP' 

Thc referendum pa~scd 1005 
approved Jnd 731 ag::lJn'>t 

To '>Cr the record str.llght, I am 
all lor upholding the referenda 
that were pfl'~nt on the bailor 

Ho\~e\'cr. we must take a clo~er 
look at thiS referendum. It does 
nor call for a complete ban of 
recruitment of tho'>e bod Ie'> 
mentioned , as Intenm Opmions 
Editor Matthew Cronin stated , 
but Instead a ban of student 
registration and actlvlry fees to 
be used for recruitment. In the 
Fall 1986 student organtzatlons 
allocations there IS no money 
allocated to organizations related 
With the military, ClA. INS, the 
Secret Service and the FBI 
( including the 00 Yacht Club) 
Thus there is no Activity Fce 
used for recruitment As far as 
Registration Fees arc concerned. 

these groups receive no dm~ct 
allocallon, howe\'Cr It ca n be 
shown that a very Indirect use of 
Registration Fees were used by 
the mere presence of the 00 
Yacht Club student organization 
at Fall Festival on the Green 
While the A does not have 
JUrisdiction over F.F.O.G. we are 
investigating the Issue . 

You sec . thiS referendum 
places the UCSD Community In 
an awkward pOSition While thl 
referendum eXist,>. we must also 
bc committed to allowing thl'> 
Unlversiry to be a forum for a 
fre.: exchange of Idea .... I am sure 
we would all agree thar If for 
example the referendum banned 
,tudent tce~ fM recruitment of 
Grccnpeace volunleCfs or l\:AACP 
Illember,. thc referendum would 
be .lCcu,>cd 01 being 
dl5Lrlllllnatol) . 

Concerning the Re\'elle Plaza , 
rhat 10cJtlon has been 
deslgn:Hed a "free speech" area 
on campus. Vendors, Hare 
Krishnas, Evangelist preachers 
and other religIOUS groups use 
the Plaza Just as the ROTC has 
been doing and there IS nor one 
dime of ActiVity Fee or 
Registration Fee aUoca ted to 
allow these groups to set up . In 
thiS 10 ation they are not 
VIOlating the refere ndum. 

The AS. Council IS enacting 
the referendum to the best of 
their abIlity It IS very easy for us 
to Implement referenda that 
directly affecb the AS Counul, 
!.ulh ,1~ thc 'Alternative Media 
question However , we do not 

have the power to prevent 
certain student organiza tions 
from eXisting and recruiting new 
members, we only have the 
power to fund or not fund these 
groups. 

In conclUSIOn, I would like to 
emphasize that the referendum 
did :lot ban all recruitment of 
the military, CIA, INS, Secret 
Servi e and FBI but instead the 
usc of student activi ry and 
Registration Fees for the use of 
sw:h recrunment.

Asia, Afnca. Latm AmerIca, and 
Australia. Students m all majors are 
ehglble , and fmanclal aId is 
avaIlable. 

While EAP IS a speci fic 
program which places srudents 
mro foreign classes, the OAP 
olTice offers no speCific 
programs. Insread , II acts as a 
"facihtating link for students 
interested m foreIgn 
expenences," said Cathenne 
Gamon, OAP advisor. ",Vhat OAP 
docs offer students is access to 
hundreds of programs offered 
throughout the world . none of 
whIch are speclfi<.:ally connened 
ro UCSD. According 10 Gamon , 
rhe OAP olTice performs three 
speCIfic roles "We help students 
to pre-plan such thmgs as 
finan Cial aid and credit transfer. 
we stay m lOU h with them while 
they're away; and we help them 
WIth their re -entr), ." she said 

The program available to 
rudent through OAP In lude 

attending college abroad , career 
mternshlps help In gemng other 
kinds of Jobs, and comb Ina non 
work /srudy opportunltles The 
main emphaSIS of aU rhese 
programs. accordmg to Gamon , 
IS 10 pla<.:e students In foreign 
cultures. 

"You can always gct a summer 
Job at home. The most 
slgnl fi cant rh Ing IS for rhe 
student to be m another culture ." 
she saId . 

Gamon uggested one of their 
summel programs. Operation 
Crossroads AfrIca, as an example 
of the many vaned oprions 
available through the OAP olTice .· 
Students m rhis program arc put 
into groups made up in half by 
American students and half by 
AfrIcan students. The groups live 
in rural African communllles; 
and perform public semce 
projects , such as bridge-building. 
Wah irs paniclpams IIvmg at rhe 
level of the rural Africans, 
Operations Cro roads

belrevcs is OAP's most Important 
functi on 10 give students an

Gamon rncourage students 
who arc mreresred In ,I foreign 
experlen e. be 1l work or school. 
to come to thr OAP offi l' and 
look through their progmm 
listings "We help students with 
their pre-planning, bUI mo t of 
the work In getting a cepted into

the student," Gamon said 

Gamon also said thar many

problem , OAP tries to get the 
students to Join one of the 
Internallonal Center' 
organizations. The Intemational 
Center offers several events 
throughout the year to allow 
returnees to hare their

~tudent s 

Two students who recently 
returned from foreign programs , 
Lisa judi e and Shoshanah 
Feher, believe the tnps were 
among the best experiences they

By rural , I mean no runnIng 
water and no electricity," she 
said She added that the reason 
she chose to go to Kenya was to 
gam that type of new eurural 
e xposu re. 

She found school surprIsIngly 
difficult. Instead of operati ng on 
a seme ter or quarter sysrem, 
classes in Kenya extend for a full 
year, and one final exam is 
wonh 70 per ent of the student's 
grade. 'There's a lot of status 
involved With going to the 
University of Nairobi ," Feher 
said . "It 's tougher to get into than 
thc I JnIversity of California." 

Feher agreed with Gamon thar 
students face di fficulty when 
they return from abroad . She 
said that thIngs taken for granted 
in this culture may seem 
unbehevable to someone from 
another culturc. "Ralph 's is a big 
shocker. What do you do with 
32 types of ketchup?" Feher said. 

As well as goi ng to Kenya, 
Feher has been to Euro~e and 
AsIa , and would like to go back 
to Kenya. Right now, she is 
planning a trip to Japan. 

judice has already gone to 
japan as pan of an OAP 
program. Judice felt that her besr 
experiences were the weeks she 
lived with a Japanese family on 
the small nonhern island of 
Hokkaido. By living in a small 
town where few Westerners ever 
go, judice believes she learned a 
lot about the Japanese spirit and 
about the traditional family 
arrangements. 

"People's relationships are 
different in Japan," she said . 
'They don't express their 
feelings, and women are still 
~cond-c1ass citizens. They're not 
expccted to work, but they 
should have dinner ready each 
night. The japanese didn 't 
understand why 1 wanted to be 
something other than a wife ." 

Judice'described OAP as 
helpful, bur agreed with Gamon . 
that "You have to really look. You 
have to inquire and send lots 01 
appltcations" to get into a 
desired program. judice also 
wants to return to japan, and 
stay for a few years. 

B~cause of her year in japan, 
judice is a strong believer in 
studying abroad. She said, "I 
think anyone who has a chance 
should do it. You don't have 
your languagc as a crut h, so you 
learn a lot about yourself." ~

Will it be Sunday, bloody Sunday ? 
Playoff hopes hinge on 
game with Claremont 
By BRIAN lTOW 

A certatn sense of antIcIpation surrounded the UC D soc 'er team as 
It gathered around ('oach Derek 
Armstrong for hIS post-game 
speech. Armstrong focused not 
on hIS team's ImpressIve 9-1 
thrashing of an overmatched 
WhlllIer College, bur on the 
team's up oming match with 
SIxth-ranked rival C1aremont-
Mudd. 

The TritOns. who have 
dropped from sixth to 
seventeenth nauonally aftcr a 
mIserable week in whIch they 
lost thrce straIght gJmes. WIll 
fa c the taggs In what \\'111 be 
theIr most Imponant gJtne rhls 
season, as the posslbillry of 
exclUSIOn from the playoffs 
looms ahead . 

Armstrong stated its 
Importance "I uon 't want to talk 
about our other games. What's 
past IS past. It's all o\'cr Our 
cnure season rest, on the 
Claremont game The playoffs 
h lOge on ItS outcome .. 

WIthout injured sweeper Pat 
McLaughltn the Trtton defense 
has been ve ry Inconslstcnt. 
Although Ir usually outplays IlS 
opponents. the Tmons have 
been prone to defensl\,e lapses. 
This was eVIdenced by theIr play 
In the Whmler game The Pocrs 
weren 't capable of getting ,my 
shots off, but were able to score 
on a nuke dden,II'C gaff by the 
TTllon defense , when Paul 
Carlson mIsplayed a P'\SS back ro 
the goalkeeper Jllo\\"lng WhittIer 
Its only goal. The offense . on the 
other hand , was qulU.' ImprCSSI\C 
as It domInated the game, 
mIssing on a numbl.'r of 
opportun ittes to WIden ItS 
already monumental m.lrgm of 
vicrory. Robby Patterson led the 
scoring with four goals, ciS UCSD 
thoroughly domlnatcd the nlnet)' 
minutes of actton . ' ttiL It seemed 

as though that game was 
secondary "In the minds of both 
the players and coaches" to the 
conlrontatlon with laremont. 

SCott trommer, who sCl)red 
the team's first goal. said. "1 
think thiS was ..I good Win. Wc'vc 
been looking down on ourselves 
after we lost three in a row. But 
now we'vc won twO in a row. 
We've got our onfidence up . 
We're on our wa}' up the 
mountain and Claremont's the 
peak." 

UCSD IS In for what could be 
ItS lOughe t game thiS season, 
but it has won at least one fan ' 
Whittier coach John FitZSimons 
He was very Impressed by the 
team's play, sa}'lng, "UCSD lO}'ed 
with us lOday. They are a very 
good team WIth lots of skIll and 
organIzation. They match up 
very well WIth Claremont: they're 
even , If not ahead of them:' 

In order for the Tritons to 
defeat the taggs, their defense 
must avoId the lapses that have 
pbgued them throughout the 
season, and theIr offen e must 
perform up to the level wh Ich Il 
dIsplayed In the WhittIer game 
One factor working In the favor 
of the Tmons j;, the expected 
return of starting sweeper 
~1 wughiin. who auld proVIde 
the stabtllty the team needs In its 
backfIeld Another important 
factor could be the antiCIpated 
home-fIeld ad\"ant.\gc LIst ycar

Remember Scarlett 
O'Hara's waistline? Who 
could forget the scene early in 
"Gone With the Wind" when 
Mammy laces up Miss Scarlett 
before the barbecue at the 
Wilkes' house - Scarlett 
bracing herself by holding on 
to one of the . bedposts, 
Mammy pulling the strings of 
the whalebone corset tighter? 
Scarlett's tiny waist was one of 
the hallmarks of her Southern 
Belledom, and unlike her 
sister Sue lien and many other 
young women of her time, she 
did not even faint when the 
corset compressed her middle 
smaller than 20 inches 
around. 

"Missing at the Polls: 
American Women of 1915," 
an exhibit at the San Diego 
Museum of Man. details some 
of the ways being born female 
has defined life for American 
Women. Although small in 
comparison to the dramatic 
and extensive Huichol Indian 
exhibit running concurrently 
at the museum, "Missing at 
the Polls" speaks eloquently 
and is of importance. 

Part of the exhibit features 
items of clothing, including a 

cinch-waist corset with 
whalebone stays, not unlike 
the one worn by Scarlett 
O'Hara and her sisters. As the 
accompanying text points out, 
the corset " not only cut into 
the flesh, but compressed and 
displaced the inner organs." 
The record for the smallest 
waist was 12 inches, two 
inches smaller than a two-liter 
plastic bottle of Coke. No 
wonder women fainted 
frequently. 

Also on display is a pair of 
"perversely narrow" pointed 
shoes, about which we are 
told that, in order to fit into 
this fashionable footwear, 
some women went so fa r as to 
have their little toes removed . 

Historically, women's 
fashions have contrived to 
keep them in bondage in one 
way or another. While today's 
women no longer wear 
corsets, they still cramp their 
feet into pointed shoes with 
stiletto heels that constrain 
freedom of movement. And, 
though women have been 
allowed to vote since 1920, in 
many cases they are still paid 
less, even now in 1986, than 
are men who do exactly the 

same job. 
The exhibit opened on the 

sixty-sixth anniversary of the 
ratification of the Nineteenth 
Amendment, which gave 
women the right to vote in 
1920_ But the women 
portrayed in the exhibit 
probably never were able to 
vote. The plaster of Paris 
busts, sculpted by Smithson-
ian Institution artist Frank 
Micka in 1915 and originally 
shown at the 1915 Panama-
California Exposition held in 
Balboa Park, depict black and 
American Indian women, and 
white women from Washing-
ton D.C., where residents 
could not vote for president 
until the Twenty-third 
Amendment passed in 1961. 

Framing the sculptures are 
quotations by women of 
several eras, commenting on 
their status as females. There 
are quotations like this one, 

which speaks directly to those 
women of today who say they 
have no need of women's 
liberation: "Women who 
have all the rights they want 
should consider that there are 
other women who have not all 
the rights they want" (Carrie 
Chapman Catt, 1891). 

The life-size busts vary in 
color from a creamy yellow to 
a dark orange-brown. All 
appear startingly lifelike. One 
bust depicts a woman -
Elizabeth Randall, 65 years 
old, American Negro - who 
has short, curly hair, high 
cheekbones, prominent 
tendons in her neck, eyes full 
of a lifetime of hurt, and a 
mouth that looks as if she 
expects nothing but more 
pain. A bust of a white woman 
- Edith R. Mosher, 35 years 
old - shows her hair rolled 
and caught with combs. With 
her pointed nose, her lips 
firmly set together, she has a 

Phol." loy Bry"" BIIy.:" 

look of determination; but, 
even though she was white, 
she would never have been 
able to influence any sphere 
larger than her own 
household. Shirley Chisolm's 
well-known 1970 quote 
applies to all these women: 
"Of my two 'handicaps', 
being female put more 
obstacles in my path than 
being black." 

The exhibit also includes a 
display of histori ca l 
photographs of women in San 
Diego. There is a photo of 
Miss San Diego Hardware, 
1895, along with a picture of 
women bellhops at the U.S. 
Grant Hotel in 1918. Perhaps 
most intriguing is the picture 
of an all-woman jury that. in 
1916, convicted four men in 
three hours. 

" M issing a t the Polls " 
continues through February

Getting the beat 
"Freaky Executives," San Francisco's innovative purveyors of World 

Beat, will play at the Pub from 4:30 to 7 pm Friday, October 17. What is 
"World Beat," you ask? It is a musical compilation of everything from 
reggae to salsa to funk to rock-and-roll. "It's a conscious attempt to 
develop a synthesis," said Matt Calahan, vocalist for The Looters 
(another World Beat band), "a new sound from the planet Earth." 

The eight-member Execs have gathered quite a following. They are sort 
of the ambassadors of this new, internationally flavored music. Join the 
global community and the A.S. in welcoming the Freaky Executives to 
UCSD. There will be free Square Pan Pizza on a first-come, first-served 
basis. This T.G. plans to be out of this world!

Sex education 
"Sex,'~ Berlin's notorious song about "not before, not 

after, but during," will be performed, so to speak, in 
UCSD's Gym Friday, October 17 at 8 pm. The L.A.-
based band found its self-produced and financed E.P. 
Pleasure Vicrim enthusiastically given airtime by a record 
number of college stations - so much so that it became 
the largest selling debut E.P. of all time. 

"Berlin," says John Crawford, the band's founding 
member, " was chosen because it evoked an aura of both 
mystery and strength." The now internationally known 
band has performed all across the United States, as well as 
abroad. Berlin's second album, Love Life, exemplifies the 
range of talent of these skilled musicians. The album 
includes "Touch," "Beg, Steal or Borrow," "No More 
Words, " and "In My Dreams." More recently, Berlin's 
successful "Take My Breath Away" was a special part of 
the box office smash Top Gun. 

Berlin is electrifying in concert. The petite, vivacious 
lead singer Teri Nunn carries the show with her energy. 
And nothing can surpass her passionate, sensual 
performance of "Sex" with John Crawford. Berlin's 
upcoming performance is courtesy of the Warren Group 
and the University Events Office. Take precautions, 
because Berlin is not to be missed!

Reggae is good - and it is 
not bOring, especially when 
it's live. And thanks in part to 
91X and Avalon Attractions, 
there will be plenty of live 
reggae this week . Brought to 
you by 91X's Reggae Macossa 
is the Fall Reggae Fest this 
Saturday, October 18, and 
O.J . Ekemode and the 
Nigeria n Allstars the 
following Tuesday. 

Skanking at the fest 
Although 0 .). Ekemode's 

music has been de ribed as 
Afrobeat, anyone who likes 
reggae will definitely find 0.). 
Ekemode and the Nigerian 
Allstars very enjoyable. The 
upcoming concert at Bogey's 
Nite Club in Mission Valley 
could turn into a rather good 
party, since the concert is a 
Nigerian Independence Day 
celebration. However, you 
must be 21 to get in the door . 

by sean duffy 

For anyone who loves, or 
even likes, reggae, the Fall 
Reggae Fest should not be 
missed. With Sly and Robbie 
and the Taxi. Gang, and 
featuring such reggae greats as 
Yellowman, Ini Kamoze and 
Half Pint, this show should be 
fantastic . The show also has 
the added attraction of being 
performed outdoors at the 
SDSU Open Air Theater. SL Y DUNBAR & ROBBIE SHAKESPEARE

Fall Reggae Fest Will bt: on 
Saturday, O ctober 18 at :30

Aml:rlcan Repertory Thea-

Tartaglia wears black, and it is

Chinese kite birds and

Is Peggy Sue 
the marrying 
kind? 
by phil macgovern 

Compariso ns are going to 
be made between Peggy Sue 
Got Married and Back to the 
Future, when none can 
realistically be made. Peggy 
Sue uses the same sort of 
theme as Back to the Future, 
but is a much better movie. 

Kathleen Turner stars as 
Peggy Sue, a modern-day 
career woman who is getting 
divorced from her husband of 
20 years, Charlie Bodell 
(Nicholas Cage). She attends 
her high school reunion, 
where after a bizarre fainting 
spell she is transported back 
to 1960, her senior year in 
high school. 

At first, Peggy Sue thinks 
she is dead, but then she 
realizes tha t she has the chance 
to change her destiny , She 
tries to break up with Charlie 
so she can avoid what she 
knows is going to be an 

unhappy marriage. Peggy Sue 
has the chance to do things 
differently, now that she 
knows what the future will 
hold . 

Charlie is a very odd 
character, to say the least. He 
thinks that Fabian is the 
hippest, and he has a singing 
voice like velv t and a 
speaking voiceJike a chronic 
nasal congestion sufferer . 
Director Franci~ Coppola has 
used this for at least two of his 
other movie , The Godfather 
and The Godfather II. Cage 
docs a wonderful job with 
Cha rlie, playing the character 
with the sort of babyish 
attitude he needs. 

Peggy Sue tne ve ry hard, 
but she nevel qUite can bring 
herst'll' to hreak up WIth 
Charlie, She seems to tall for 
him whenever he blinks his 
puppy-dog eyes. If Coppola 
wanted to porrray Peggy Sue 
as independent, he didn't do a 
wry good job. 

The best parts ofPt'ggy ' ue 
come right after she goes back 
In time, It is very hght-hearted 
comeJy at this point, as Peggy 
Sue looks at l:arly Sixties 
attitude through her Eighti 
eyes. Peggy ue thinks she i 
still an adult, but l'veryonl' 
else thinks she is sweet 16. It 
makes for some hilarious 
moments.

Perforll1ance of historical perspective 
Cecil Lytle, an a com-

plisheJ musician and the 
chairman of the Music 
Department at UCSD, will 
perform in the first of the 
Bosendorfer concert series 
this Sunday, October 19. He 
will be interpreting Uszt's 
Sonata in B Minor anJ 
Scriabin's The Five Lust 
Preludes and The Seventh Piano 
Sonata . 

Lytle is especially looking 
forward to this co ncert 
because he feels that Scriabin 
is one of the most underrated 
composers of his era. Scriabin 
combined nineteenth-century 
traditions with what is now 
known as twentieth-century 
theoretical music. Though 
others have been credited 
with developing twentieth-
century style, Scriabin was 
among the first to break away 
from the ea rlier traditions of 
composers such as Beethoven 
and Bach. 

Lytle is currently recording 
all of Scriabin's works ,

because he feels that the 
composer is not getting the 
recognition he deserves. Lytle 
thinks of his upcoming 
performance not as an 
ordinary " piano recital," but 
as a concert with " historical 
perspective." Scriabin was 

by sebastian j . french 

experimenting with new 
musical ideas years before 
other compose rs became 
popular by doing so. 

Lytle also helped acquire 
one of the world's three 
Bosendorfer pianos for 
UCSD. Of the other two, one 

In 1960, at the World's Fair in Vienna, the Austrian 
gornment asked the Bosendorfer piano company to 
contribute something to represent Austria, because all it 
had at the time was a carload of Austrian cheese (for 
which Austria is famous). What Bosendorfer came up 
with were three futuristic pianos, which diverged from the 
classic grand piano design in that they were made almost 
entirely of rosewood instead of ebony, giving them a 
richer tone. 

The pianos' basic design was also quite different: the 
shape is basically a geometrical triangle (without the 
familiar curve of most grand pianos), which slopes 
downward, away from the player. The one at UCSD was 
donated by Mrs. Juliet Pitt of La Jolla, who with her 
husband fell in love with it at the Vienna World's Fair and 
made arrangements to buy it,

directing, producing and

has also appeared as a soloist 
in concerts throughout 
Europe and the United Sta tes.

Th previews for Peggy ue 
are touting this as the story of 
a woman who has the chance 
to change her destiny. Try as 
she will, Peggy Sue does not 
even come close to doing this. 
Her voyage back in time seems 
to have no effect on her 

I future. This leaves the 
annoying question of whether 
or not the viewer has just 
watched one of Peggy Sue's 
dreams. Peggy Sue influences 
the course of world events 
only in that she starts the geek 
thinking about the microchip 
ten years before it was 
considered possible. How, 
ever, she does gain insight on ~ ":"..::: 16.1986 7140 ~i~;:; ~

When Peggy Sue comes 
back to the fu ture, she is in the 
hospital, awakening from a 
coma. C harlie is right there by 
her side, and he looks 
remarkably older but still act5 
like the gangling adolescent 
previously seen. With her 
new knowledge, will Peggy 
Sue go back to Charlie? You 
have to see for yourself, and I 
recommend that you do. 
Peggy Sue Got Married is a very 
entertaining and enjoyable 
movie, especially if you don't 
think too hard about it.
