EOP Cutbacks 
Hit Hard 
at UCSD 

by Nick Vanocur 
Staff Writer 

UC San Diego, in addition to 
being confronted with the problem 
of dealin~ with a restricted budget, 
may also have to face the difficulty 
of lack of funds in the Basic 
Educational Opportunity Grants 
program (EOP), the ' federal 
government's largest student aid 
program. 

UCSD's EOP director, Bill Byrd, 
said recently that the shortage of 
funds is probably due to the fact 
that more students are now aware 
of the program than in past years. 

He also said that although the 
cutbacks affect all schools, it will 
have more impact on UCSD 
because of its higher percentage of 
lower income students. 

AddiUooal FUDding 
In the first two years of its 

existence the nation-wide EOP 
program did not use all the funds in 
its budget. Since then, the funds 
have been made available to 
seniors and juniors as well as 
freshmen and sophomores. 

The program subsequently faces. 
the prospect of a cash shortage 
unless it receives additional fund-
ing from the federal goverrunent. 

This year, the program was 
allocated $820 million; but national 
EOP authorities say another $160 
million in additional funding is 
needed to meet the current 
demands. 

The additional funding could 
come as either a supplemental 
appropriation from Congress or as 
an advance on next year's budget, 
which, according to Byrd, amounts 
to basically the same thing. 

Peter K. Voigt, head of the EOP 
m the US Office of Education, says 
that unless they receive the ad-
ditional funds, "We will have to ask 
institutions to reduce each award 
y 20 per cent which would, of 

course, cause chaos." 
Heavier Burden 

These cutbacks would. affect 1.2 
nillion college students, with the 
lffect varying with the financial 
,et-up in each school. A much 
leavier burde'n would be placed on 
the school if the student is unable to 
nake up this loss. 

To qualify for an EOP grant, a 
. turlent must send an application to 
he American College Testing 
rogram. He may then obtain a 

'r.ant of up to $1,400, depending on 
hat he is qualified to receive. 
If the grant is approved, the 

noney is sent to the school the 
\tudent attends. The school then 
'ives the money to the student who 

,nay uae the money for any pur-
lX)se.

Students To Meet In 
Autonomy Conference

ternoon on the Revelle campus. According to the

In what could be the most im-
portant student conference at UC 
San Diego this year, represen-
tatives of the various student 
factions on campus will meet in a 
conference on Student Autonomy 
and Governance Sunday afternoon. 

The conference, which is 
sponsored by the Student 
Cooperative's Internal Affairs 
Action Center and the 
Administrative Interns, will focus 
on three topics : fractionalism at 
UCSD, student motivation and 
student government on campus. 

The conference will take place 
from two to eight at the Inter-
national Center. It is open to 
people by invitation only. 

Senator Me Govern Wants Alternatives For 
America; Makes USD Appearance 

by Sara Lowen 
Community Editor 

Re-echoing the "come home 
America" theme of his 1972 
Presidential campaign, Sen. 
George McGovern (D-S.D.), in a 
speech given last Tuesday at the 
University of San Diego, said "We 
must call America home. I'm not 
talking about isolationism. I'm 
talking about restoring the values 
of human dignity that launched 
this nation 200 years ago." 

Our Cold .War policies, 
McGovern said, have given us a 
bad international image, as "a gun 
runner to dictatorships. " 

Network of Spies 

The US national security policy 
has resulted in a waste of billions of 
dollars on "nuclear overkill" and 
" a secret network of spies to fight 
the Cold War." National security 
oolicy has also " led our leaders to 
place themselves above the Con-
stitution," McGovern said. 

corporations if the power of the 
individual is to be restored. 

Though he described the present 
economic and social conditions in 

McGovern's speech, which dealt 
with the need for America to spend 
less money on defense and more on 
the welfare of its citizens, was the 
prototype for a radio series which 
McGovern plans to make on 
" Alternatives for America." The 
series will deal with the condition 
of life in America and how it can be 
improved. 

The overriding concern of 
American leaders with the ap-
pearance of power has resulted in ~ 
their neglect of national dignity, 
McGovern charged. " We may be 
number one in space, but we're the 
only country that has allowed its 

McGovern said he was deeply 
concerned about present con-
ditions in this country. He cited US 
foreign policy and defense spen-
ding as the major obstacles to 
improving social and economic 
conditions. 

cities to disintegrate. " 
No worker, McGovern said, 

should remain idle when cities, 
railroads and transit systems need 
rebuilding. As well as providing 
jobs for its citizens, McGovern said 
that America must reform the tax 
system and control the major 

Delay Asked in OK Of 
Kolender as SDPD Chief 

The local American Civil Liberties Union (CACLU) has asked the City 
Council to delay the confirmation hearings of William Kolender for police 
chief until after the completion of the council's investigation of police 
intelligence operations. City Manager Hugh McKinley opposes that idea, 
saying that Kolender's position would have no bearing on the in-
vestigation. 

The investigation resolution, approved last Thursday by the council, 
also asked the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to hold hearings 
in San Diego to investigate Federal Bureau of Investigation activities 
here . 

A third phase of the investigation involves probing the relationship 
between both organizations' intelligence operations in San Diego. Special 
issues are the FBI harassment of blacks in Southeast San Diego and the 
finding of the Secret Army Organization, which attempted to terrorize 
radical groups in the early 1970s. 

Stili Responsible 
McKinley held that no matter what Kolender's status was he would still 

be .responsible for past actions. It's arguments convinced the council, 
which voted to delay the first special hearing until after th Feb. 18 date 
set for Kolcnder's confirmation hearing. 

Kolender, .who is currently acting police chief, i not expected to have 
any trouble In that hearing. The hearings have been set by the council for 
every fourth Thursday through June 30. 

Larry Schwartz, chairman of the ACLU's police practice committ , 
told. r p~rt rs I.ast week that the confirmation hearings should b d layed 
untIl pohc offIcers are clear d of any Involv ment in th FBI a tiviti s . 
He also sugge ted that the probe be hortcned to allow earli r action n 
Kolender's confirmation. 

George McGovern 
America as "an affront to 
American values," McGovern said 
he has faith that the goals set forth 
in the American Revolution will be 
realized in the future. 

"We need to redeclare the 
American Revolution, not as a 
political slogan but as a serious 
commitment to change. We need 
to continue with the changes that 
we started in the 1972 election." 

Errata 
In its news brief Feb. 4 entitled 

" NOW Discusses Advertising," the 
Triton Times reported that a 
meeting last Thursday "was one of 
a regular series of 
meetings ... sponsored by NOW." 
In reality the meeting was of the 
biology department's Women's 
Group, which meets every 
Thursday. 

That group sponsored the 
speaker from NOW, whose name, 
incidentally, is spelled McGuffin. 

In its article Jan. 30 on the 
Disabled Student Union and the 
Chancellor'S Advisory Committee 
on the Physically Limited, the 
Triton Times reported that the 
DSU plans a concert featuring UC 
San Diego stars Sheils and lark. 

We failed to mention the 
headlin r for that how, folk Inger 
Sam Hinton. 

Mor details will be announ d 
later. 

Cl ar up Rumors 

It is the desire of Ron Green and 
Mark Rapaport, the prime movers 
behind the conference, that 
" Students who are 'involved' on 
campus can be brought together to 
talk" and clear up misconceptions 
they might have about each other. 

Through the conference, the 
interns and the internal affairs 
center hope to focus attention on 
current campus issues, such as 
accredidation and budget cut-
backs, and "at least initiate 
discussion about the role and 
future of student governments at 
UCSD." 

Green, the Administrative 
Interns coordinator, and Rapaport, 
the Coop's internal affairs co-
coordinator, hope for " some sense 
of community" among UCSD 
students to emerge from the 
gathering. 

The conference is planned so that 
the three discussion topics will first 
be considered in small groups of 
five or six people. Then the entire 
group will meet to talk over the 
small group discussions on the 
topic.

Dr. Waldo Neal 
Memorial services were held yesterday in the high-energy physics 

laboratory in Urey Hall at UCSD (or professor Waldo Neal, a pioneer in 
the field . 

Dr. Neal, 54, of 8881 La Jolla Roads Farm, died last Friday in his lab. 
According to COWity Coronj!r's office, Neal was cleaning his high output 
carbon dioxide laser when it accidently fired, wiping out large portions of 
the frontal and temporal lobes of his brain. 

Neal was born in Gonad, Miss., where he spent most of his life. His 
mother, a large woman, worked in a store sweeping floors to pay for 
Neal's tennis lessons. 

Neal attended Mississippi University, where he was graduated summa 
cum white, taking a bachelor of science degree in wad physics. From 
MU, he went to Harvard, where he did his graduate work with the hope of 
being hired to teach at UCSD. 

He began teaching at UCSD five years ago, though some students have 
disputed this. 

During his research here, Neal discovered several elmentary particles-
-the cake meson, the Casey kason and the klingon-for which he was 
awarded the Nobel Certificate of Merit and a Proctor.silex toaster. 

According to Neal's wishes, made before his death, Neal was cremated 
with a Cricket cigarette lighter and his ashes were inurned in the canned 
vegetable section of a local superma rket. 

Surving are a wife, Louella, and a son, name of Willis . 

Roscoe Mota 
Services will be held in Off ramp, Tex., tomorrow for Roscoe Mota DI , 

son of the late Roscoe Mota n and Rhoda Mota. 
Rhoda Mota nee Rhuda, the developer of Rhoda's Atomic Floor Polish 

and Cough Syrup, was described by those close to her as " saddened or 
stricken" and "didn't seem to be getting much enjoyment out of her 
month-long vacation in Rome." 

Mota III, 22, died Wednesday in his Del Mar apartment, electrocuted by 
a faulty toaster given to him by a professor at his school, UCSD. 

A student majoring in physics, Mota took a great interest in faculty 
affairs, possessing a large file of information on them which paid his way 
through college. 

Mota was scheduled to graduate this spring and had received firm job 
offers from Jack in the Box, Sears-Roebuck and the marketing division of 
Atlantic-Richfield Oil Co. 

Cremation is planned, with the ashes to be scattered over the fast lane 
ofInterstate 10. 

Dr. Marcus Herrold 
Dr. Marcus Herrold, UCSD's foremost professor emeritus, is dead 

today at the age of 73. 
Perhaps the most respected chemical philospher of our time, Herrold 

left behind almost three hWidred pages of an unfinished manuscript, 
titled " Eros, Fertilization and Nitrogen Fixation." 

Th~ COWity Coroner's office said that Herrold was discovered dead in 
his campus office by his secreta ry, who said " he just looked particularly 
dcad that day (Thursday ). " 

The coroner estimated that Herrold had been dead for three months, 
and explained his appearances at class and before crowds as " the results 
of vestigial muscle contractions." 

In respect to Herrold , his office will be retired. Plans call for making it 
into a shrine.

league Battle Tomorrow Night 
UCSD Ready for Rival W"'~Y"-----I"I 

by Dave Eisen 
Sports Editor 

When the Triton basketball 
team travels to University High 
School tomorrow night to battle 
USIU, all in attendance will see 
three things: 

First, the last game of the first 
haU of the 1976 conference 
season. Second, a fight between 
two tough inter-city rivals. 
Third, and most importantly, 
whether or not UC San Diego 
deserves to be in this season's 
NAlA play-offs. 

The Tritons (2-2 in league, 9-11 
overall) will be looking for 
r6enge against the Westerners 
(3-1, 12-3). USIU won a 66-58 
decision from UCSD in a non-
conference match two months 
ago. 

Both teams trail Cal Baptist (4" 
0, 20-2) in the NALA District 3 
Southern Division, with little 
chance to catch the Lancers. 
Two teams from the. league will 
be sent to the play-offs, with 
USIU now owning the inside 
track. 

A win for UCSD over the 
Westerners would not only tie the 
teams for second, but make the 
Tritons the favorites to go to the 
post-season play. One game 
remains between the two squads 
after tomorrow night, two weeks 
from now in UCSD's main gym. 

Not to be overlooked in the race 
are Azusa Pacific (2-2, 7-13) and 
Point Lorna (2-3,12-3) . 

After winning six of their last 
eight games, UCSD was beaten in 
a non-conference game, 87-70, by 
the University of San Diego 
Tuesday night. 

The Toreros, a strong NCAA 
Division 2 school, featured a front 
line of 6'10",6'7", and 6'4". The 
center, Gary Ely, apparently 
a disciple of Bill Walton, 6'10, 215, 
from Walton 'salma mater, Helix 
High in La Mesa. 

The Tritons cOWitered with 
their three-guard offense, which 
was for the first time handled by 
an opponent. 

UCSD was held scoreless for 
the first five minutes, and trailed 
19-10 12 minutes into the game. 
The halrtime deficit was just ten, 
at 34-24. 

The Tritons fell behind by as 
much as 19 in the second half.

few minutes. Thefull-courtpress

before being halted by the

Ely dominated the game with 

16 points and 15 rebounds, while 
teammate Ken Smith scored 21 . 

Guard s Ke n Melvin and 
Mallory Mitchell again headed 
the UCSD effort, with 17 and 16 
points respectively. 

Wong vs. Wu in Ping Pong 
Second seed K.Y. Wong meets fourth ranked Wilson Wu in the win-

ner 's bracket semi-finals, today at 3 pm in the rec g ym, as the UCSD 
Table Tennis Championships continue. 

.I~ ~he double elimination tourney, Wong and Wu are the only Open 
DIVISIOn players to remain Wlbeaten. In his quarter final match Wu 
surprised top-rated Richard Alden, 21-18, 21-19, whilc Wong do'w' neell 
Steve Nessenblat, 21-9, 27-25. 

32 players began in the open which sta rted play Monday, while 14 
were sIgned up 111 the Novice Division. 

With the double elimination style, most top players still have a chance 
fer a championship. Ross Bott, the third s ed is the only ranked player 
to be eliminated. '
