Scholars voice concern 
over U.S. military action 

IR/PS hosts panel of professors to discuss 
Iraq on eve of U.S. House, Senate vote 

By THOMAS NEELEY 
Associate News Editors 

Four scholars voiced their con-
cerns about the prospect of military 
action in Iraq during a panel dis-
cussion hosted by the UCS D 
Graduate School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies on 
Oct. 10. 

The panel of two UCSD pro-
fessors, a former UN weapons 
inspector and an international law 
professor from California Western 
School of Law in San Diego spoke 
to an audience of nearly 200 indi-
viduals, including Chancellor 
Robert e. Dynes, faculty, students 
and members of the community. 

While the scholars acknowl-
edged Iraq 's status as a dangerous 
state, they did not believe tha t the 
United States should venture into a 
military operation against Saddam 
Hussein. 

"I don 't see the logic or necessi-
ty of acting now," said Stephan 
Haggard, a professor at IRIPS. 

Hasan Kayali , a UCSD profes-
sor of history, felt that the Bush 
adtninistration's reasoning behind 
pursuing Iraq was a diversionary 
tactic, citing both the upcoming 
elections as well as the course of the 
campaign in Afghanistan. He also 
said that the U nited States must be

UC Regents urged to 
adopt solar energy 

A.S. Council presented with 1,200 .. 
signature petition in favor of proposal 

By CARLAN WENDLER 
Staff Writer 

In a brief public ceremony on 
Oct. 9, several UCSD students 
de livered A.S. President Jenn 
Brown with 1,200 petitions urging 
the UC Board of Regents to adopt 
a measure that would require all 
new and renovated buildings to 
receive 25 percent of their electric-
ity from solar panels. 

John Muir College junior 
Andrea Cornford addressed the A.S. 
Council and UCSD students with 
some information regarding global 
warming and solar power. The A.S. 
Council followed the student coun-
cils in the UC system, including 
Berkeley, Los Angeles, Davis and 
Santa Barbara, in declaring its sup-
port for the solar energy resolution. 

Students from the nine UC 
campuses formed a Sustainability 
Coalition last year and drafted this 
clean energy resolution over the 
summer. With the help of a 
Greenpeace advisor and a prece-
dent set by a similar policy already 
in effect at the L.A. Community 
College District, the resol ution 
catalyzed the statewide initiative 
for solar energy. 

Faith Winter, a member of the 
Environmental Coalition, com-
mented on the urgency of this cam-
paign. 

"With construction of [the new 
campus at] Merced, UC will be the 
largest construction consumer in 
California, and we want all that 
construction to be done with solar

FallFest rocks RIMAe Arena 
Blackalicious, MxPx and)5 play to 2,000 students 

By DANIEL BROWN 
Contributing Writer 

Unli ke last year, RIMAC Arena 
was able to accommodate every 
UCSD student who showed up to 
this year's Fa l1 Fest on Oct. 10, 
allowing over 2,000 people to 
cram onto the arena floor and 
bleachers to see the 2002 lineup of 
Jurassic 5, Mx.Px and Blackalicious. 

Last year, the AS program-
tning office faced a crowd that 
overwhelmed RIMAe's capacity 
and was forced to turn away stu-
dents due to the lack of space. The 
A.S. programming office tried to 
anticipate this predicament by 
swi tching the venue to RIMAC 
fie ld to accommodate the over-
whelmingly large demand . 
However, Fall Fest was forced to 
yield the open-air venue to the 
men's soccer team, which was 
scheduled to play a home game 
that evening.

student activity fee. By a majOrity 
of 7 1 percent, the ERC C0ll11l1l1J11ry

Researchers find evidence 
for similar solar system 
A team of international researchers, 

including UCLA professor of astronomy 
Benjamin Zuckerman, has uncovered evi-
dence that there may be other solar systems 
like ours. 

The team found that there are other mas-
sive planets with wide orbits like that of 
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune; this feature is 
essential for a star to support life. 

The researchers zeroed in on Fomalhau~ 
which is 25 light-years away from our sun 
and is one of the biggest stars in the sky. The 
results of the study, which will be published 
in the Astrophysical Journal, indicate that 
there is a distorted disk of cold dust sur-
rounding the planet, which is most likely the 
cause of a large planet tugging on the disk 
nearby. 

The researchers believe that Fomalhaut's 
solar system will provide insight into what 
the Milky Way looked like when it was only 
200 million years old. 

Public school teachers 
happier, better paid 

A new study conducted by the UC 
Berkeley reveals that prekindergarten educa-
tors working in public schools are better edu-
cated, better paid and enjoy more job stability 
than teachers in private educational settings. 

The authors of "Inside the Classroom: A 
Study of Staffing and Stability in State-
Funded Prekindergarten Programs' focused 
on programs in Califomia, Georgia, Illinois, 
New York and Texas, and concluded that pri-
vate schools function as a tra ining ground 
for prekindergarten teachers. 

After receiving training and completing 
apprenticeships at these facilities, the teach-
ers often move on to higher-paying jobs in 
public settings. To view the full report, visit 
I1Mw.ccw.org on the Web. 

In the Oct. 10 issue of the Guardian, the article titled "Warren deans fire 8 RAs" stated 
that eight RAs and one Warren college intern were fired. In actuality, seven RAs and one 
Warren College intern were fired.

UC alleges 
C.U.E. strike 
during August 

was illegal 
By EMMA SCHWARTZ 

Daily Californian 
(U. California-Berkeley) 

(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. 
- A complaint issued by a state 
labor board against the University 
of California at Berkeley clerical 
union may hurt the union in next 
week's negotiations with the 
Universi ty of California. 

The complaint, issued on Oct. 
9 by [he Public Employment 
Relations Board, requires the 
board to look into the University 
of California's allegations that the 
three-day strike by the Coalition 
of University Employees in 
August was illegal. 

The board will hold a hearing 
regarding the charges of unfair 
labor practices. Complaints issued 
by the board do not find either 
party guilty or innocent. 

"This is not a judgment of any-
thing," said Margy Wilkinson, 
chief negotiator for the clerical 
union . "I hope to resolve all of the 
outstanding issues at bargaining 
table." 

UC officials said the strike was 
illegal because union leaders had 
not reached a bargaining impasse. 

"[The) complaint confirms 
these strikes are presumptively 
illegal and demonstrate bad faith 
tactics by the union," said Gayle 
Cieszlciewicz, executive director 
of UC labor relations, in a state-
ment. 

But representatives from the 
clerical union said the strike was 
legal because it was called over 
unfair labor practices.

Following MxPx, Los

Jurassic 5 took the stage and per-
formed a set that included songs 
off of their new album, "Power

talent, coupled with the avant-
garde mixing of DJs Nu-Mark 
and Cut Chemist, kept students 
well-entertained. 

"Their show is an example of 
why they're one of the best live 
perfonning hip-hop artists in the 
business," said student Thomas 
Chu. 

Jurassic 5 responded to the 
audience's strong response with 
an encore of freestyle rapping.

The RAs' violation of university policy led 

to their justly conducted dismissals 
The university's handling of the Warren 

RAs firings was improper and unfair 
By CASSANDRA PIERCE 

Senior Staff Writer 

A few weeks before school started, some 
of the resident advisers living on campus 
threw a party in an Earl Warren College 
apartment for a resident adviser who had 
just turned 21 . Alcohol was served at this 
party. At this point, nothing is wrong with 
this situation. However, add to this sce-
nario the fact that some of the RAs in 
attendance were underage, and 
you have an administrative 

underage intern ended up at this party. 
Whether they were invited or crashed the 
party is unclear and irrelevant. 

California law is written very specifically. 
California state law, business and profes-
sions code 25658 states that anyone who 
"sells , furnishes, gives or causes to be sold, 
furnished or given away" any alcohol to a 
person under 21 is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
Strangely enough, unless this is in a public 
place (which an apartment is not), the minor 

in question who possesses or 
consumes said alcohol is not

the big deal is . 

guilty of a state crime. Both of 
these actions are against univer-
sity policy, but only one is a legal 
crime. PRO If one of the underage RAs so 
much as picked up a wine cool-
er, the people who threw the 

party would have been immediately guilty of 
a misdemeanor. This law applies regardless 
of the age of the provider of alcohol. The 
rest of the studen ts who were a t the party 
and retained their jobs did violate university 
policy, but broke no laws. So although they 
received less punishment, they committed 
fewer violations (according to state law) -
and the administration cannot afford to lose 
all of the RAs involved. Furthermore, the 
RAs who were fired were returning RAs, 
and the university expects them to be better 

Some feel that the RAs should not have 
been fired, that this was too drastic a penal-
ty for this small crime. Most of the RAs in 
question disagree with this, however, feeling 
that the punishment was merited, but the 
way it was carried out was unreasonable and 
unfair. 

According to tho e who know the RAs 
and the situation, the parry was originally 
Intended to be only for RAs 21 year old and 
up. Since this was during RA training, all of 
the Warren RAs and Warren college TV 
IIlterns were living in the same area .

During the investigation, Warren 
Residential Life determined the extent of the

they were hired, agreeing to abide by all 
housing regulations. As such, they were in 
breach of contract - clearly ample grounds 
for termination. 

But this ordeal revealed more flaws in the 
Warren administration than in the ex-
employees. The process by which they were 
terminated was informal, flawed and unfair, 
and Warren Residential Life needs to 
change it. It is unnecessary to reinstate the 
RAs, some of whom would not go back even 
if asked, but it is essential that the investiga-
tion process is fixed and the rights of future 
RAs are safeguarded.

the identities of their accusers. In cases of 
student misconduct involving residents 
other than RAs, those accused can appeal 
their case to a student-run judicial board 
where the accusers are revealed and ques-
tioned. Revealing the identity of the accusers 
lessens the possibility of people throwing 
around unfounded accusations or accusa-
tions stemming from personal or biased 
opinions.

UC support for Israel should continue Vanilla is 
crucial, but 
chocolate is 

Call for university to divest is misguided and wrong 
By DUmN FRELICH 

Contributing Writer 

In a profoundly poignant and 
erudite speech on Sept. 17, Harvard 
University President Lawrence H . 
Summers expanded on what he saw 
as a growing anti - Israel bi as 
throughout the world . Indeed, the 
increasing fervor against the right of 
a Jewish state to exist should strike 
anyone as unusual. 

"[I thought] the question of the 
right of a Jewish state to exist had 
been settled in the affirmative by 
the world community," Summers 
sa id before going on to discuss 
growing doubtfulness on the 
words. And he seems to be right. 

Summers asked us to consider 
some of the global events of the last 
year: synagogue burnings, physical 
assaults on Jews, or the painting of 
swastikas on Jewish memorials, all 
taking place in nearly every 
European nation. Particularly dis-
turbing is the trend of supporting 
candidates who denied the signifi-
cance of the Holocaust. In France 
and Denmark, politicians with such 
persuasions reached the runoff stage 
of elections for the nations' highest 
offices. 

What Summers also brings to 
our artention is that "profoundly 
anti-Israel views are increasingly 
finding support in progressive 
intellectual communities." 

In accordance with other "pro-
gressive intellectual conununities," 
our very own UC faculty has creat-
ed what they call the "University of 
California Faculty Petition for 
Divestment from Israel." Boasting 
196 UC facul ty signatures as of Oct. 
2, 2002, - 23 from UCSD - the 

divesonent cam-
paign calls for 
"the University of 
California to 
divest from Israel, 
and from U.S. 
companies that 
sell arms to 
Israel." 

If not, an 
entire nation 
and people will 
be wiped off 
the face of the 
planet. And 
some people 
are actually 
willing to let 
that happen. Israel is just 

one of the many 
nations to 
receive U .S. for-
eign aid. Let's 
not forget that 

CAMPUS 
Facts and 

Logic About 
the Middle 
East, a non-
profit educa-

Israel is arguably the only true 
democracy in an area rife with dic-
tators and fascists and has only 
gone to war for defensive purpos-
es. (Don't forget the Gulf War, 
during which Israel sat idly by at 
the request of American leaders in 
hopes of solidifying the Arab coali-
tion against Saddam Hussein.) 

Maybe we need to pay atten-
tion to the other side of this great 
conflict to understand Israel 's 
plight. 

A report released by the Israeli 
government titled "The Arafat 
Papers" details Yasser Arafat's 
involvement in the sponsoring of 
suicide bombers and terror. In 
fact, a main finding of the report 
concluded, "Yasser Arafat was per-
sonally involved in the planning 
and execution of terror attacks. He 
encouraged them ideologically, 
authorized them financially and 
personally headed the Fatah AI 
Aqsa Brigades organization." 

It was none other than Arafat 
himself who said, "Peace for us 
means the destruction of Israel and 
nothing else." Is it then any won-
der why we need to support Israel? 

tional organization, supports U.S . 
aid to Israel. The organization 
argues that the $2 .8 billion in aid is 
fiscally reasonable because "Israel's 
military and political importance 
[as the only real democracy] in the 
Middle East and its strategic posi-
tion stabilize the entire area ... [aliI 
without having a single American 
soldier stationed in its territory." 

Clearly, the benefit of sending 
money to Israel rather than having 
to send thousands of American 
troops to keep the peace -
putting American soldiers' lives at 
risk and costing us even greater 
sums of money - is well worth it. 
The situation should be viewed in 
terms of preventative and not 
reactionary aid. 

One of the main beliefs, and 
indeed an argument right at the 
beginning of the UC Divest peti-
tion, is that "continual military 
occupation and colonization of 
Palestinian territory by Israeli 
armed forces and settlers" is unac-
ceptable. 

F.L.A.M .E. Challenges this 
notion by pointing out that "Israel 
acquired the territories (the 'West

Bank' and Gaza) in defense of an 
aggressive war waged against it. 
No country in history has ever 
been asked to return such territo-
ries. Do the Poles return the huge 
chunk of Germany that they 
acquired in the wake of World 
War II? Do the Czechs return the 
Sudetenland? Do the French 
return A1sace-Lorraine?" 

In this call for the return of the 
"occupied territories," those in 
opposition to Israel say that peace 
will only ensue once territories are 
returned. But I ask them, if Israel 
was once attacked at those bound-
aries where there were no occu-
pied territories (in the first of six 
succeeding offensive wars waged 
against Israel), what makes them 
so sure it won't happen again? 
More and more, that argument 
seems a first step in the destruc-
tion of Israel, not a resolution of 
peace. 

All in all, why is Israel con-
stantly being held to a different 
standard? If no other nations are 
being called to return territories 
won in war, much less won in a 
defensive war, then why is Israel 
being asked to do so? The bortolTl 
line : War is not a game where you 
can say, "Oops, do-over." War is 
for keeps. A nation going to war 
against another nation has to real-
ize the consequences. 

Those who play around with 
extreme intentions of genocide are 
doomed to revel in the conse-
quences and accept the outcome. 
War is serious, not something to 
be toyed with, especially when the 
purpose is a crime against human-
ity - the removal of a people and 
their nation.

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Basically: Chocolate, not vanilla, can stand alone 
Ollllllued from page 5

Vanilla is like foreplay for your 
taste buds: You can have a good 
lime with it, but addlllg to It can

word, vanilb IS the baSIS for the 
greatness, the perfection. the 
mollth-watenng orgasm that is 
chocolate. 

And would you settle for fore-

think not. So why settle for vani lla 
when you could have chocola te' 

Arguably. you can't have 
chocolate without vani lla . Every 
chocolate recipe involves vanilla . 
Why' Vanilla tastes good . No 
doubt about it. But if something 
can only be improved by adding 
other flavors (l ike chocolate) to it, 
then It cannot, by definition, be 
the best there is. Vanilla, there-
fore, cannot be the best. This is 
because chocolate is. 

For exa mple . on Valentine's 
Day, you do not (unless you're an 
Idiot) give your significant other 
a hox of vallill a. T his is beca use 
you want to give the people you 
10"e the best. which (as I think I 
have made clear) is chocolate. Of 
course , thiS IS also because 

chocolate is an aphrodisia c. 
Chocolate makes you horny -
enough said. 

Think about it. (The choco-
late, not being horny - stay with 
me here, people.) . 

Technicall y, I " 
can end th is col-

bovine-inclined), and so on. These

stuff.

Furthermore, 
chocolate is a

argument. But 
there are sti ll 
more reasons why 
chocolate kicks 
vanilla's 
metaphoric ass, 
and because 
enjoy a solid ass-
kicking, I sha ll 
enumerate them. 

First of all, the 
names of choco-
late-flavored foods 
are better.

but adding to it can 
only make it better. 

In other words,

Anything just vanilla can only be 
called exactly that: vanilla. 

Umm, no. T he 
only nation dumb enough to 
even consider such a stupid idea 
is probably Russia , and we all 
know what happened to them. 
Mm-hmm. 

Boring. 
But chocolate foods have a 

plethora of cool names. Devil 's 

Picture Yourself Here! 

Now, th e argument has been 
made that vanilla is tlle most pop-
ular ice cream flavor, thus clearly 
proving that it is better than 
chocolate. 

Obviously, this is not true. The 
only reason people buy so much 
vanilla ice cream is to put choco-
late toppings on it. 

And even if all those people are 
eating the vanilla straight-up, 
since when does the fact that a lot 
of people do it make it right? A lot 
of people voted for Bush. A lot of 
people have mullets. A lot of peo-
ple are math majors. A lot of peo-
ple are celibate. Does that make 
any of those things right? 
Absolutely not. 

So basically, chocolate makes 
you horny, and Russia is probably 
against it. If you need any more 
reason than that to like chocolate 
better than vanilla, take a carron of 
vanilla ice cream and jam it right 
up your ass. See how much you 
like it then.

prised if anyone e-mailed her at

do so, understand that it is at your 
own peril.

Commitment to solar

Editor: 
Re: "UC System Pressured to 

'Go Solar'" from Vol. 107, Issue 3 
of Tht UCSD G'UIlrdion. 

Thank you for your recent arti -
c�e expressing the significance of 
the UC Go Solar campaign, which 
has had an extremely successful 
campaign on many UC campuses. 
Although your article focuses 
mainly on UCLA, it is important to 
realize that the UC Go Solar cam-
paign has an overwhelming amount 
of support right here on the UCSD 
campus as well. 

As of our kickoff meeting on 
Oct. 3, the UC G o Solar cam -
paign already had over 70 dedi cat-
ed volunteers and over a dozen 
interns working h ard to put the 
UC Go Solar resolution in effect 
here at UCSD . The advocates 
will rally to get the resolution 
passed, first through the A.S. 
Council, and ultimately by the 
UC Regents on N ov. 13 of th is 
year. 

Already, 1,200 UCSD Stu-
dents, facul ty and staff have 
signed peti ti ons showi ng a 
tremendous amount of suppOrt in 
favor of passmg th e resolution. 
which would req uire all new ana 
renovated buildings to receive 25 
percent of their electncity from 
solar panels, and an additional 25 
percent renewable energy efti-
ciency. 

T hank you again for helping to 
bring the UC Go Solar campaign 
to the attention of the UCSD 
community, but again, it is impor-
tant for UCSD students, faculty 
and staff to understand that they 
too can join the historic efforts of 
the campaign by volunteering and

Trip to Kansas teaches a lesson 
of unity despite differences 

Experience at peace march leads to a 
recognition of American commonality 
By JESSICA LlNCiEL 

Associate Opinion Editor 

I wasn't expecting a lot from my 
visit to Lawrence, Kan. The only 
reason 1 went was to visit my friend 
Laura. I'd lived in the Midwest for 
two years. I knew what was in store 
for me: long, flat expanses of fields, 
drawn-out vowel sounds and a cul-
ture devoid of tolerance and full of 
conse rva ti sm. 

The latter, at least, turned out 
not to be the case. Laura took me to 
the campus radio station, where the 
D J and I discussed the merits of 
classifying Kitty as being metal or 
not. We went to a Latin dance 
party, where I taught semi-sober 
boys how to salsa. But almost the 
first item on my Kansas itinerary 
was attending a pe2ce march. 

It wasn't a big deal. There were 
less than 200 people, I'd guess, but 
what they lacked in numbers they 
made up for with enthusiasm. 
There was an incredible array of 
social and politicaJ organizations 
present, most of which had cause-
appropriate signs in tow. There was 
an anarchist organization, the 
Womyn's Empowerment Action 
Coalition, antiwar pacifists with 
roots dating back to the Vietnam 
War protests, students, professors 
and one UCSD TritOn,looking on 
in hapless amazement. Everyone 
was in a good mood and eager to be 
there. 

We marched up the street and 
then we marched back, chanting, 
singing, clapping, smiling and wav-
ing to people on the sidewalks and 
in cars. Sometimes people would 
wave back and smile, sometimes 
they'd glare and mutter something 
about being unpatriotic. Both 
responses elici ted further peace 
signs and grins. 

Then there was a rally, where 
whoever felt like it spoke to the 
crowd. First were peace organiza-
tion members, and then some pro-
fessors, followed by a political anar-
chist who kept his comments 
refreshingly reasonable, and finally 
a former member of the Navy 
speaking on anti-Arab propaganda 
that had been part of his training 
during Operation Desert Storm. 

I was moved. 1 wanted to jump 
up, grab the mike and yell, "Thank 
you!" Here, in the middle of what I

had always known to be a world 
dominated by zealous conservative 
values, a world completely devoid 
of liberal persuasions, were people 
who were backing the same pacifist 
stance that I was. It was simultane-
ously surprising and wonderful. 

It's not like everyone in Kansas 
was a huge proponent of the peace 
march. There were people who 
frowned as we passed by, people 
who refused to even look at us and 
people who yelled out accusations 
of supporting terrorism. One par-
ticularly relendess opponent to the 
rally had apparently decided to 
dedicate his day to protesting our 
protest. His comments ranged from 
"Hug a tree you hippies!" to "Do I 
smell patchouli?" to "You worship 
Saddam!" Retaliation took the form 
of correcting his pronunciation of 
Saddam, actually hugging a tree, 
offering to hug him and generally 
deriving amusement from his 
ardent antics. 

Laura showed me a good time in 
Kansas, single-handedly shattering 
some of the longtime stereotypes 
that I'd had about the coastless por-
tions of the country. But I'm partic-
ularly grateful to her for taking me 
to that march. Never have I been so 

hopeful about the possibility of 
national unity. 

It 's easy to take sides on an issue 
like war. It's easy to pick teams 
when it comes to feeling threat-
ened. It's also easy to let those divi-
sions take over, and in the process 
we lose sight of the incredibly 
important idea of unity. This 
national crisis isn't just happening 
to one city, one group of people, 
one party or one portion of society. 
It's happening to all of us. Despite 
the fact that we are a collection of 
individuals, we are still a collec-
tion. 

I know I forget that on occasion. 
I forget that this society is com-
posed of people who are, overall, 
very similar. It was incredibly 
inspiring to see that people in 
Lawrence felt the same way I did. It 
was such a wonderful experience to 
feel connected to people who were 
living lives so completely different 
from mine. 

My position isn't that everyone 
should adopt the same point of 
view. I don't think that there's any-
thing to be gained from conform-
ing to the same perspective, even 
for the sake of protecting one's 
country. We identify ourselves by 
our beliefs, our values, our ideas 
and the freedom to have a vast spec-
trum of perspectives - something 
to be protected, not forgotten. 
What I'm advocating is recognition 
of the idea that we are more con-
nected than we think, that separa-
tions are not as prevalent as we may 
think. 

This country will not be 
destroyed by terrorism, not direct-
ly. It will not be destroyed by bio-
logical weapons or nuclear bombs. 
The only real threat to this 
nation's security is the division 
between its citizens. As long as we 
continue to separate ourselves 
from one another, conflict is 
inevitable. As long as we keep 
clinging to stereotypes about one 
group or another, we're just eating 
away at whatever chance we have 
for cohesiveness. 

If people can recognize similari-
ties in one another, even if every-
thing else seems complete.ly foreign 
and odd, then there is always some 
semblance of unity. And as long as 
we have that, then there is always 
some semblance of hope. 

It's a great class - but I'm 
also studying Problem Solving 

& Decision Making at ExtenSion, 
where practical skills 

are the focus.

Con: Situation reveals that 
resident advisors need more rights 

continued from page 4 
their right to appeal their terminations, nor 
were they informed in writing whether any 
such right exists. They do have the right to 
appeal to a higher authority - in this case 
to Warren College Dean Jeff Philpott, -
but nowhere in their letters of tennination 
was this right specified . The right to appeal 
a termination is essential, and should be 
enumerated as one of the rights of residen-
tial life employees. 

To their considerable credit, the Warren 
resident deans did allow the eight the oppor-
tunity to write letters of resignation instead of 
being fired, which will help them when apply-

Usually, residents involved in alcohol vio-
lations are reported either by an RA or a res-
ident security officer to the Residential Life 
Office. The RSO or RA must have docu-
mented the violation and, if the resident 
decides to appeal to the college judicial board, 
he or she must appear at the hearing and con-
sent to questioning. In this instance, there was 
no initial evidence proving that any violation 
occurred; no RSO broke up the party on Sept. 
6, and none of the RAs in attendance decided 
to turn themselves in. 

There was certainly no cross-examination 
of the accuser, no hearing in front of a stu-
dent-run judicial board and no chance to pre-

ing for future jobs. However, 
this allowance for a letter of 
resignation should not be 
dependent upon the gra-
ciousness of whichever resi-
dent dean happens to occupy 
the office; it should be a per-
manent provision of employ-
ment of RAs and interns.

pare a defense. The accused 
were put on investigatory 
leave, forbidden to perform 
any of their job-related 
duties, and their TritonPlus 
accounts were frozen and 
meal point expenditure lim-
ited. They were essentially 
presumed guilty of viola ting 
university policy based on 
the testimony of thei r 
unnamed accusers, wi thour 
having been afforded a fair 
hearing. Though some had 
admitted guilt during inter-
views, they were not given 
enough chance to explain 
their actions. 

Most of the eight were 
given less than a week's 
notice to move out of their 
on-campus residences. In 
off-campus apartments, 30 
days notice must be given 
before eviction. Although 
the Warren resident deans

- offered to help them find off-campus 
housing, it is a considerable inconvenience 
to be homeless for a few days while housing 
is secured. At least 15 days notice should be 
given, to provide those fired with time to 
move thei r belongings into storage and to 
arrange for temporary housing. 

Another problem with the resolution of 
this incident is the unequal application of the 
law and 'university policy. At least 10 other 
RAs, some underage, attended the party, but 
they emerged relatively unscathed. That dis-
crepancy must be addressed. If two persons 
are in the same place at the same time, break-
ing the same university policy, they should be 
treated the same when they're caught. 

lne problem with this situation is not its 
conclusion, but the process by which it was 
reached. The Warren Eight violated policy, 
and Warren Residential Life was fully within 
its rights to tenninate their employment sta-
tus - though Warren residents left with an 
understaffed Residential Life office will now 
suffer for the rest of the year. However, the 
investigation was conducted suspiciously, and 
change needs to happen. N o one was particu-
larly shocked at the idea of college students 
drinking - deplorable, yes, but not unheard 
of. The aspect of this oial that needs anention 
is not so much the questionable activities of 
these RAs, but the manner in which their 
Wlthinlcing actions were handled.

Iraq: Academics weigh in on U.S plan 
cominued from page I 

careful in assuming Iraqis are in 
favor of a U.S.-led intervention. 

"We should certainly not 
assume that the general hatred of 
Iraqis for Saddam Hussein mean 
they are pro-U.S .. " Kayali said. 

Ha ggard and Kayali held dif-
fe rent o pinions regarding whether 
or not the I raqi people would fall 
Into ethnic and regional fac tions, 
descnhing the process as 
"Balka niza tlon" in reference to 
what happened after Yugoslavia 
dissolved in 199 1. 

To prevent th at process, 
Hagga rd addressed the issue of 
reconstruction, believing that the 
U.S. plan for Iraq after ousting 
H usst:in will determine the suc-
cess of the enti re venture. 

" I think [reconstruction) is the 
thing that the intervention will 
ultimately be judged," he said. 

Kayali was skeptical of U.S. 
reconstruction plans and said he 
wanted to see clearer ideas for 
what happens to Iraq after 
Hussein. 

"I don't see a plan to protect a 
unified Iraq," he said. "The 
administration has not, in my 
opinion, given any assurances 
[Balkanization] won't happen." 

John Noyes, a professor of law 
at California Western School of 
Law, gave a brief lecture on rele-
vant parts of the U.N. charter that 
included references to sovereignty, 
military intervention and sel f-
defense. He said any military 
intervention in Iraq approved by 
the U.N . Security Council would 
be in compliance with the charter. 

"The legality depends on the 
scope of the resolution," Noyes said. 

Ray Zilinskas, a professor at the 
Monterey Institute ofInternational 
Studies, spoke of an "unhealthy 
phobia of Iraq." He likened the

Leading discussion: Professors Michael Bernstein, Hasan Kayali, John Noyes, 
Ray Zilinskas and Stephen Haggard, left to right wait for the panel to commence. 

United States's fear of Iraq to that 
of Cuba, which garnered some 
applause from the audience. 

Zilinskas, who was a U .N . 
weapons inspector in Iraq, 
described what he called Iraq's 
policy of udeception and deceit," 
which slowed the weapons inspec-
tors' ability to disarm Iraq. He 
said that if Iraq does allow 
weapons inspectors to re-enter the 
country, fewer nations are willing 
to allow give Iraq much leeway. 

"I just don't think the U .S. 
government and international 
community would accept that 
[again] ," Zilinskas said of the 
deception and deceit. 

Michael Bernstein, professor of 
histoty at UCSD, moderated the 
discussion. He called the event a 
"teach-in," inspired by scholarly dis-
cussions held on university campus-
es in the 1960s during escalating 
U.S involvement in Southeast Asia. 

The event was sponsored by 

IRJPS , the Insti tute for 
International, Comparative and 
Area Studies, the history depart-
ment, the Middle East Studies 
Program, the Office of Student 
Affairs, the Office of Academic 
Affairs and the six UCSD colleges. 

The panel was held hours after 
the U.S. House of Representatives 
vmed 296-133 in favor of a resolu-
tion to authorize President George 
W. Bush to use force in Iraq. Most 
Republican members voted in favor 
of the resolution, while most of their 
Democratic colleagues voted against 
it. Congresswoman Susan A. Davis 
(D-Calif.), who represents the dis-
trict that includes UCSD, voted no. 

The U.S. Senate debated the 
resolution later that evening and 
also approved the resolution, which 
passed 77-23 . California's senators 
split their votes, with Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein voting yes and Sen. 
Barbara Boxer voting no on the 
measure.

Irolll over 95 compal1les in the

were pre~cnt to recruit for job 
UpCllIllgS and internships. 

"The Job fair provided an

said Employer Relations 
Coordinator Andy Rabitoy. 

Kimberly Hughes/Cuordian 
Job hunting: Tough times in the technology sedor have made it increasingly 
difficult to find a job for recent graduates after a long period of prosperity. 

Sponsored by the Career 
ervices Center, this annual fair 

offered a chance for srudents to 
explore and ask questions about 
job prospects in their respective 
fields . In addition, recruiters held 
on the spOt interviews and accept-
ed student resumes. 

Junior Kimberly Truong said, 
"It's helped me to see the kind of 
companies out there." 

However, srudents who are still 
largely undecided about a career 
did not feel the event was too 
helpful in making the decision any 
dearer. 

"The fair was tOO specific and 
wasn't geared towards a broader 
group of students," said freshman 
Ken Sull y. "I was looking for a 
job during school, but most of the 
companies required post-doctoral 
or bachelor degrees ." 

This fair comes at a time when 
technology based stocks are plum-
meting. In the last decade, the 
internet and telecommunications 
industry experienced rapid 
growth. 

More recently, according to 
Secretary of Commerce Donald 
L. Evans in a letter to Secretary of 
State Colin Powell , "mounting 
debt loads and consrricted capital 
markets have slowed the industry'S 
progress." 

"This fair gives me a chance to 
personalize my resume," said a 
first year grad student who wished 
not to be identified . "But I'm 
worried about the market being 
down. I wished that I had put 
more focus in school."

"Solar power is the solution to

Even nominal increases in the 
usage of solar power, when multi-
plied across all UC campuses, rep-
resent a slight but significant 
decrease in the release of green-
house gases, according to Conford.

MONDAY. OCTOBER 14.2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Gordon-Ligot: RPI concerns student regent 
continued from page J 

California ; it reviews and designs 
policy for all 10 UC campuses. 

Ligm-Gordon is both a regent 
and a full -time student. He is a 
fifth-year student attending UC 
Berkeley. He became a full-voting 
regent in July and will continue his 
post through June. As a student 
regent, Ligot-Gordon said he 
serves in two capacities. 

"The official capacity of the Stu-
dent regent is to serve as a regent," 
Ligot-Gordon said. "Unofficially, I 
can advocate for issues within the 
university in a very public forum." 

This year, the major issue that 
Ligot-Gordon said he will be 
addressing is the RPI, which will 
appear on the March 2004 
California ballot. The initiative, if 
passed, would prohibit state institu-
tions, including the University of 
California, from collecting any 
race, e thnicity or national origin 
data. 

Ligot-Gordon said that he will 
be working to inform srudents on 
this issue throughout the year. 

"My goal this year is to educate 
students about the issue," Ligot-
Gordon said. 

Ligot-Gordon opposes the ini-
tiative because " the voters of 
California are being asked to make 

themselves igno-
rant of problems 
and of our great-
est asset, which is 
our diversity," he 
said. 

The problem 
with RPI, accord-
ing to Ligot-
Gordon, is not 
having access to 
data. 

" If we can't 
collect the data, 
we can't analyze 
the data. We are 
fo rced to ignore 
the problems and 
we can't design 
programs to fix 
them," Ligot-
Gordon said.

ing the year by the Board of

proposed by UC Regent Ward 
Connerly. Ligot-Gordon said that 
because the initiative originated 
from a regent. what the university 
does will be important. 

troversial, Ligot-Gordon hopes to 
see debates on all 10 UC campuses 
addressing the issue. 

While at UCSD, Libot-Gordon 
also spoke with students about 
expanding the University of 
California's curriculum to include 
Fil ipino-American studies. He is 
working on this issue with students 
not only at UCSD, but across the 
UC campuses. 

"People will watch what the 
University of California does," 
Ligot-Gordon said.

of peace," he said. 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 

echoed Principi 's statements about 
the importance of the role of veter-
ans and the Armed Services, not 
just in San Diego, but also in the 
creation ofUCSD. 

"This is an appropriate time to 
discuss the importance of veterans 
in this region, and an appropriate 
place," Dynes said. 

The chancellor then detailed 
the history of Camp Matthews, a 
Marine Corps training camp that 
was housed on what would eventu-
ally become the UCSD campus. 

As if to demonstrate that histo-
ry, veteran Marion G uynn had 
rrained at Camp Matthews in 1938, 
and maintained that he was the 
only San Diego veteran in atten-
dance who could boast service that 
far back. After his training at what 
would one day become UCSD, 
Guynn, who is now 81 years old, 
served in the Marines in World 
War II and was a Japanese prisoner 
of war for four years. 

Dynes also called attention to 
the importance of the sacrifices of

OnLlni on TMI 'Monl .. 

those who have served in the armed 
forces to students who now have 
the freedom to attend college, 
choose their major and countless 
other freedoms that Dynes said 
were won in the battles fought by 
the military. 

"There is a srrong connection 

" Our students have those 
freedoms because of the 
sacrifices of our nation's 

veteran."

Chancellor 
between those two," Dynes said. 
"Our students have those freedoms 
because of the sacrifices of our 
nation's veterans. I am intensely 
aware of the debt we owe our 
armed forces." 

In closing, Dynes reflected on 
the novelty of this lcind of confer-

ence, saying, "I hope that this [con-
ference] will open the door to more 
scholarly research into the impor-
tance of the veterans in this region. II 

Lotchin, a historian who has 
virtually pioneered the study of the 
impact of veterans on the commu-
nity and region of San Diego, 
described the efforts of San Diego 
citizens to attract the Navy to San 
Diego in the early part of the 20th 
century. Though in competition 
with Los Angeles, San Francisco 
and Long Beach, Calif., San Diego 
eventually beca me the Navy's 
major port on the West Coast and 
played an integral part in the 
Pacific theater of World War II. 

The main point that Lotchin got 
across was the fact that San Diegans 
were "never divided about the 
Navy," and thus the city became 
what he calls "Forness: San Diego." 

After Lotcmn had concluded, the 
conference broke up into four small 
discussion panels, each with its own 
particular focus. The conference 
ended with Jacob's discussion, titled 
"From Navy Blue to Girl Scout 
Green: Serving the Community 
after Serving the Nation."

Referendum: Fee increase 
to begin winter quarter 2003 

continued from page I 
ing. 

"One of the first things we plan 
to do is give money to those events 
and clubs that asked and didn't get 
anything [from SCERC)," 
Chapman said. 

Some students were not enthu-
siastic abom the srudent activity 
fee. Representing the dissenting 29 
percent, ERC freshman Raina 
Katbi does not look forward to 
increased fees for the rest of her 
tenure at UCSD. 

"I voted against the referendum. 

Personally, I think it sucks because 
I don't have a lor of money," Katbi 
said. 

Yet in accordance with the over-
whelmingly affirmative vote, there 
are still many other srudents who 
are excited that the referendum 
passed. 

"I think that if it provides us 
with a lot of opportunities for 
activities, then it's well worth its 
costs to us," said ERC freshman 
Zack Grounds. "I look forward to 
dances or whatever they have set 
up."

Informational materials were 
available for the students to 
browse. Also, employees of these 
companies were at hand to answer 
questions. 

According to Shelley Burrola of 
BD Biosciences, a company based 
in San Diego, "there is a growing 
dynamic in the industry. It's con-

FEATURES 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography's 

By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Senior Staff Writer 

William E. Ritter, a professor of zoology at the University of California at Berkeley, had yet to 
secure a permanent facility to conduct 
hi s summer research projects after 
almost a decade of looking, but accepted 
the invitation of San Diego physician 
Fred Baker on the condition that he 
would receive funding locally to support 
the program. 

So when three community leaders 
pledged $4,500 apiece at a Chamber of 
Commerce meeting on Sept. 26, 1903, 
the Marine Biological Association was 
born. Neither Ritter nor the original 
benefactors of the MBA, who renamed 
it the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography in 1912, could have pre-
dicted the significance their grants 
would have on San Diego and the scien-
tific world. 

Last month, SIO iaWlched a year-long 
celebration of its lOoth year of existence 
and has during its 1 ()() years grown from a 
series of rudimentaty experiments in the 

Anniversary 
boathouse of the Hotel del Coronado to 
what SIO Centennial Director Kevin 
Hardy calls "the Mecca of the oceanogra-
phy world." 

Special events are scheduled for SIO's 
centennial, where the storied history of 
the institution will be commemorated 
with a lecture series touching on the 
accomplishments SIO has made in the last 
century. 

The beginnings 

Ritter had originally pursued San Pedro, Calif., as the si te for his sum-mer facility, but was unable to obtain 
permission to stage his research in the 
region because of the City of Los Angeles' 
plans to build a harbor in the area, elimi-
nating any chance of conducting srudies 
of natural marine behavior. 

The professor then turned to Baker, 
whom he had met while honeymooning 
in San Diego over a decade earlier. Baker 
was aware of Ritter's desire to start a 
summer research program on the 
Southern California coast and had writ-

ten him several times urging 
him to relocate his work to 
San Diego. With San Pedro 
out of the picture, Ritter 
moved his project to the 
boathouse at the Hotel deJ 
Coronado, thanks to fund-
ing by E.W. Scripps, Ellen 
Browning Scripps and 

\ Homer Peters. 
Upon receiving its first 

grant, the MBA was com-
prised of a handful of 
scientists who oper-
ated out of the

to travel berween San Diego and 
Berkeley, Calif., until 1909, when it 
became apparent that the MBA would 
have the monetary resources and inspira -
tional-backing of the Scripps family at its 
disposal. The MBA had purchased a 170-
acre tract of oceanfront property in La 
J oUa for its future site. The land, valued 
from 530,000 to 550,000, was purchased 
by the MBA for only $992 because other 
land speculators agreed not to bid Oil it. 

COllStruction of the new site began 
immediately with the help of very liberal 
donations from Ellen Browning Scripps. 
By 1916, cOllStruction of the director's

Sixth College offers a new minor to students this fall 
The Chicano and Latino arts and humanities minor hopes to increase diversity on campus 

By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

As Ifldlca ted by the U.S. Census 
of 2000, of the 33 million people 
tha t live in California, 32 .4 percent 
of them are of Hispanic or Latino 
heritage. This number is expected 
to reach 50 percent within 30 years. 
As one of the largest ethnic groups 
in Cali fornia , the history and cul-
ture of Chicanos and Latinos in 
thl country has become parr of our 
na tional culture. 

tarting this fall, UCSD Stu-
c.lents have a new opportunity to 
expand their hori zons with the new 
Ch ica no and Latino arts and 
humanities minor, which is affiliat-
ed with Sixth College. 

"We are very excited that this 
minor passed. r t fits our theme of 
'culture, art, technology' just beau-
tifull y. It is one example of what the 
theme means," said Gabriele 
Wienhausen, provost of Sixth 
College. 

As Sixth College'S first minor, it 
is an interdisciplinary program that 
includes courses from all the major 
social science and humanities 
departments includ ing theatre, 
visual arts, literature, history, eth-
nic srudies and Spanish. 'A1though 
it is closely linked to Sixth College,. 

all UCSD students may pursue it. 
According to Jorge Mariscal , lil-

erature professor and director of the 
program, "There was strong support 
from the UCSD faculty for this 
minor. And based on the wealth of 
courses that already exist in this area, 
we 've created a rigorous and rich 
curriculum to underpin this minor." 

Ethnic studies professor Ross 
Frank is also enthusiastic about the 
new minor. 

"The minor offers a !,'leat inter-
disciplinary opportunity for people 
from the Latino community, no 
maner what they're majoring in, to 
understand the history of the 
Latino community in the U nited 
States and to think about their part 
in building the present and future of 
this community," Frank said, who is 
also a member of the program's 
steering committee. "It gives every-
one an interdisciplinary mix that 
might not be otherwise offered." 

Although the new minor may 
initially seem very similar to other 
programs of study offered at UCSD, 
such as ethnic studies or Latin 
American studies, it is distinctly dif-
ferent. Between 1973 and 1989, 
UCSD had a Chicano studies pro-
gram that eventually melded with 
ethnic studies and lost its identity. 
This new program is designed to 

complement any area of study that a 
srudent may be following, whether 
it be biochemistry or communica-
tions, by delivering and highlighting 
the school's resources in the human-
ities and arts with regards to 
Chicano and Latino history. 

"This minor compliments many 
majors," Mariscal said. 
"Additionally, employers look for 
people with Spanish language pro-

" Giving the Latino com~ 
munity more visibiUty 
wiU bring mare Latino 
students to campus. J) 

- Jorge Marisca~ 
literature professor 

ficiency as well as a knowledge of 
the history of these communities, 
which is also very useful. " 

Another goal of the minor is to 
attract more Latino srudents because 
they are severely underrepresented 
on this campus, making up a mere 8 
percent of undergraduate srudents. 

"The administration is exci ted 

because giving the Latino commu-
nity more visibility will bring 
more Latino students to the uni-
versity," Mariscal said. "It will also 
improve the campus climate to 
create one that is beneficial to the 
students. I amici pate there will be 
lots of positive consequences for 
the university." 

The Chicano and Latino arts 
and humanities minor will not 
restrict its courses exclusively to 
ones that concern the Chicano and 
Latino experience. There will also 
be an interest in the indigenous cul-
tures of both North and Latin 
America, known as indigenismo, 
where certain people identify them-
selves with the Native American 
culture, which is also closely related 
to the experiences of Latinos. 

This type of program exempli-
fies the Sixth College philosophy: 
a course of study that highlights 
the community through study of 
culture, art and technology. While 
Sixth College does not require the 
study of a foreign language, two 
years of spanish are required for 
the minor. In such a state as 
California, where the Latino pop-
ulation is high, knowledge of 
Spanish can be highly beneficial. 

But one of the most important 
functions of this minor, according 

to Marisca l, is "to serve as a clear-
ing house for all Latino oriented 
events, to be a focal point for 
events that may already exist, to 
bring people together who nor -
mally don 't talk. " 

This minor is one way to unify 
and educate the communi ty about 
the Chicano/Latino culture by 
publicizing events that take place 
in this region. 

To inaugurate the creation of 
the new minor, Arturo Madrid, a 
professor from Trinity University, 
will be lecturing at the Cross 
Cultural Center on OCt. 25 at 4 
p.m. Madrid taught at UCSD from 
1970 to 1973 and hel ped found 
Thurgood Marshall College. 
Although this is one initial step 
tOward teaching about the history 
of the Mexican and Latino experi-
ence, much still needs to be done. 

"Now, we need space. A place 
where people can go," said litera-
ture professor Rosaura Sanchez, 
who is also on the minor 's steering 
comnllttee. 

A centralized place is needed for 
administrative suppOrt, advising, 
donations and for other functions .

POLITICAL 
FICTIONS 

By MARGOT STILES 
Contributing Writer 

Widely acclaimed for her mini-
malist prose and keen powers of 
observation, Joan Didion arrives at 
the Neurosciooce's Instirute on 
Oct. 15 for an on-stage interview 
about her la test work. Ranging 
from topics like t he intentional 
cover-up of a massacre in EI 
Salvador to the pseudo-intellectual 
whining of Newt Gingrich, Joan 
Didion's "Political Fictions" pre-
sents a bleak yet familiar view of 
politics in the Urtited States 
through a collection of eight essays 
written for the "New York TImes 
Book Review." 

Book: Political Fictions is Didion's latest 
1Mlrk. 

Didion outlines exhaustive 
examples of how American 
"democracy" is dominated by an 
elite political class with Iinle con-

cern for the citizens themselves. 
Didion will speak about 

her work in conversation with Dr. 
Michael Bernstein, a UCSD pro-
fessor of history and economics. 
The interview is part of the 
Revelle Forum sponsored by 
UCSD Extension, which aims to 
open conversations with leading 
cultural figures in a public venue 
and offer a glimpse of the person 
behind the persona. As described 
by City Arts & Lectures, Inc., the 
Revelle Forum highlights "diverse 
perspectives" from leaders "in the 
world of art and ideas." 

Didion began her career by 
winning Vogue magazine'S essay 
contest as an undergraduate at the 
University of California at 
Berkeley. After working as a 
columnist in New Yorlc, she 
reached national popularity in 

1968 with "Slouching Towards 
Bethlehem," a collection of essays 
about the turbulent 19605, and 
"The White Album," followed by 
several more novels. 

"J oan Didion is one of the most 
eminent writers in America, and 
has been for a long time," said 
Daniel Atkinson, director of 
UCSD Extension 's department of 
art, humanities and languages. 

Presently, Didion has shifted 
toward non-fiction works about 
American cities and culture, part-
ly based on experience as a politi-
cal campaign reporter. 

In "Political Fictions," the 
author's biting criticism of the arti-
ficial narratives and ubiquitous 
photo opportunities created for 
political gain speaks to a yearning 
for the candid, the genuine and the 
real. With building intensity, she 

describes the collusion between 
politicians and the mass media to 
limit decision-making power to a 
handful of target voters, and push-
es the point with overwhehning 
detail. 

It's tempting to wax nostalgic 
for her more vivid and tangible 
fiction. However, her m o ral vision 
is as clear as her delivery, and the 
attention to detail that made her 
name is just powerful investigative 
reporting. 

While the ticket price of $35 
may be daunting, the organizers 
of the event hope to reach a 
broader audience through UCSD 
TV broadcasts of all Revelle 
Forum events. The Forum 's kick-
off event in September featured 
the editor of Harper's Bazaar,

Survey says ••• students are healthy Scripps: Institution will 
host a year, long celebration University survey reveals the undergraduate lifestyle 

continued from page r 3 
By SAM WILSON 
Contributing Writer 

From the people who brought 
you the "Academic Advising 
Needs Assessment and 
Satisfaction" inventory comes 
"The Healthy Physically Active 
Lifestyles" survey. Based on the 
tabulated responses to a survey of 
over a thousand students, wi th the 
help of a few statistical tweaks and 
motivational prods, the Student 
Research and Information branch 
of Student Affairs compiled our 
self-assessment on all things 
health. If you don't like the results, 
you have nobody to blame but a 
giant statistical sample of your 
own peers. 

The survey asked students 
about their activities and 
lifestyle, including exercise 
habits, sleep patterns, health 
goals, motivations, diet and body 
perception . 

Dr. William Armstrong, the 
head of the comminee that put 
together the study, was surprised 
by student health at UCSD. 

"Students have a lot more 
exercise and fi tness in their lives 
than we would have thought," he 
said, attributing some of the dif-
ference to the invigorating 
effects of San Diego weather. 
Half of undergraduates get at 
least three days of exercise per 
week. 

However, UCSD students 
should not pat themselves on the 
back too much. According to the 
Institute of Medicine, everyone 
should get at least an hour of 
exercise every day in their lives. If 
this seems a bit more rigorous 
than you remember, you're right; 
the surgeon general used to ask 
for JUSt three days per week. 

According to today's stringent 
demands, only four percent of 
srudents are giving their all and 
exercising daily. You might know 
these people as exercise addicts or 
neurotic spandex troops, but they 
are now the model fitness citizens. 
No wonder a majority of both 
males and females want to change 
their exercise behaviors. 

Health isn 't the only reason 
that students make the trek to 

RIMAe. Trailing physical fitness 
by only three percentage points at 
73 percent is personal appearance. 
On the other hand, most students 
said they could not exercise as 
much as they would like because 
of time constraints, while only a 
minority reported a lack of moti-
vation as holding them back. 
Smdents want to be fit, but they 
just can't always fit it into their 
overloaded schedules. 

According to Armstrong, the 
preoccupation with aesthetics has 
gonen bener over the years. He 
said that binging and purging 
used to run far more rampant, cit-
ing research done by a colleague 
in graduate school. 

"Let's just say it was really bad 

" Students have a lot more 
exercise and fitness in 

their lives than we would 
have thought." 

- Dr. William Annstrong, 
SUlVey coordinator 

for the plumbing system," he said. 
"Of course, this was back in the 
'SOs." 

But the janitors don 't have to 
worry these days, with only one 
percent of boys and girls saying 
they use vomiting or other means 
of purging to lose weight. 

"Students, especially fresh-
men, are coming to class more 
stressed out than ever, " 
Armstrong said. 

With most srudents feeling 
overwhelmed at least occaSionally, 
and a majority of female students 
frequently feeling depressed, col-
lege life does not offer the sancru-
ary from the outside world that is 
often reported. 

In the shuffle of working, vol-
unteering, sociali zing and study-
ing, it is difficult to take care of 
the body. Not surpri si ngly, a fu ll 
night's slee p is often the first 
casualty in the war for time. The

dents report getti ng more than 
three restful nights of sleep per 
week. 

Several groups had an interest 
in tile resul ts of the study. A con-
siderable investment is put into 
gym and dining facilities every 
year, and the administration wants 
to make sure thal tllere is a sub-
stantial rerum in srudent satisfac-
tion. 

When it comes to dining ser-
vices, half of students were unhap-
py with the amount of healthy 
campus food available, while 10 
percent of respondents opted out 
of this question entirely. 

There were also questions 
about gym facilities that didn't 
make it into the publicly available 
results. Students were asked 
whether they would be interested 
in 24-hour gym availability, but 
most students replied that they 
were satisfied with the normal 
gym hours . This makes sense, 
<s ince many students cited the 
social atmosphere of working out 
as a major motivation. 

To get a large representative 
sample of the student body, 
researchers used a few lifts. tucks, 
pokes and prods. All black, Latino 
and Native American individuals 
at the school received the e-mail 
to account for the disturbingly 
low numbers of those students on 
campus, according to Armstrong. 
Women and men were both 
equally sampled, but since women 
were more attentive in replying, 
men were given quite a few more 
remin der e-mai ls to ensure 
action. 

At first glance, the number of 
seniors polled seems unnaturally 
high, but the school doesn't want 
to overlook all of the fifth- and 
sixth-year students. Getting the 
impressive 29 percent response 
ra te wasn't just chance either. Gift 
certificates to local stores and 
other enticements were used to

tated the German Navy by devel-
oping a submarine detection device 
that overmatched U-Boat fleets . 
The United States' domination of 
the seas duri ng World War I, 
remarked Admiral Karl Doenitz of 
Germany, was largely because "the 
enemy has rendered the U -boat 
war ineffective ... through his supe-
riority in the field of science. " 

The Bible of oceanography 
Oceanography would not be the 

multi -disc iplinary scientific fi eld it 
is today without the work of SIO 
researchers. More specifically, the 
field of oceanography was born out 
of the pages of "The Oceans: Their 
Physics, Chemistry and General 
Biology," a textbook authored by 
Sverdrup and SIO professors 
Martin W.Johnson and Richard H . 
Fleming in 1942 . 

"The Oceans" was the first text 
to cover the crossing over of sci-
ences in regard to the marine 
world. The book was not released 
abroad until after the close of 
wwn because of the advantage it 
gave the U .S. Navy. 

Dozens of oceanography insti-
tutions were created after "The 
Oceans" was released. American 
oceanography facilities at 
University of Rhode Island, 
Oregon State University and the 
University of Hawaii all attribute 
"The Oceans" as their original 
instructional material, as do institu-
tions in Argentina and India. 

Other aClOmplishments 
SIO has played host to some 

very important programs and 
accomplishments. In 1965, Sea Lab 
rr wa< constructed 205 fee t under 
water and approximately 3,000 feet 
off of the La Jolla coast where the 
Scripps Canyon begins. Sea Lab II 
housed researchers in the underwa-
ter laboratory for- 45 days, where 
th e first radio transtnission was 
made between parties underwater 
and orbiting the earth in outer 
space. 

Aquanaut and filmmaker 
Jacques Cousteau also visited SIO 
in 1966, where he brought in the 
vessel CALYPSO to film the 
marine life and topography in the 
La Jolla and Scripps canyons. 

Courtsey of Saipps InstiMion of Oceanography 
Charles F. Kennel 

Director of Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography 

Cousteau's VISit had a inspiring 
effect on SIO researchers. 

"I learned more in one day 
[with Cousteau) than I have in the 
last 15 years," said marine geologist 
Fran Shepard. 

The celebration 
SIO is encouraging everyone in 

the UCSD and San Diego com-
munities to participate in thei r 
year-long centennial celebra tion . 

"The Centennial celebration is 
really a celebration of San 
Diegans," Hardy said. "Without 
the hospitality of San Diegans, who 
knows where William Ritter would 
have set up his summer laborato-
ry?" 

Several programs exclusive to 
this centennial year will be made 
available to the general publi c. 
such as an underwater film fes ti-
val, a public lecture series, K- 12 
outreach programs and a centen -
nial cruise, amon g other evc l1 t~ . 
Hardy urges the public 10 attend 
as much of th e celebrati on as Jl ()~ ­
sible. 

"I'm hoping the centennial ele-
vates the people of San Diego " 
awareness of how important the 
rel ati onship between Scripps and 
the commllni ty is to each other," 
he said. "From a loca l view, \ '111 
hoping the people of San Diego 
can see their significa nce in the 
institution's formati on ."

One subject the survey did not 
focus on was a popular undergrad-
uate vice. Although the survey 
asked students how many days per 
week students and their peers 
smoke and drink, those surveyed 
said they shied away from binge 
drinking. 

"Binge drinking didn't seem to 
be that big a deal here," 
Armstrong said. He cited the 
small number of drinking-related 
emergencies, the lackluster Greek 
life, the relatively dry campus and 
the lack of a party-ready college 
town. "It's not like San Diego 
State," he concluded.

Allergies? 
Have your 

• questions 
answered 

To your 
health • , .. 
Erika Hallen-Baino 

Why is it that I can have 
allergies. causing me to sneeze, 
when visiting Japan but not 
here? 

- Kelly, Eleanor Roorrorit 
College 

Allergic Rhini tis is an inflam-
matory disorder of the upper ai r-
ways caused by inhaled allergens. 
Allergens are airborne proteins 
found in the everyday environ-
ment (this may explain the 
absence of your symptoms in San 
Diego). The most common symp-
toms are severe itching of ears, 
nose, eyes andlor throat and 
sneezing. 

Seasonal allergens cause allergy 
symptoms during spring, summer 
and fall when the trees, grasses and 
weeds are pollinating. 

Perennial allergens are found 
inside the home environment. 
Dust mites, mold spores, pet dan-
der and cockroaches carry aller-
gens. When an allergen is inhaled, 
the body responds by releasing a 
histamine that triggers an inflam-
matory response - this is why we 
take antihistamines (i.e. Benadryl) 
- resulting in clinical symptoms 
of Allergic Rhinitis. 

There are also irritants in the 
environment like smoke and pol-
lution, of which Japan is a top 
polluter. that can worsen symp-
toms. 

If symptoms are mild or irreg-
ular, antihistamines (Chlor-trime-
ton, Benadryl) are a solid choice. 
Be aware of the drowsiness effect 
and read the label carefully for 
drug interactions. For others, like 
myself, who suffer from chronic 
allergies, a prescription oral med-
ication (Allegra, Claritin, Zyrtec) 
or nasal spray (Flonase, Nasacort 
AQ, Nasonex) can provide signif-
icantly better relief without caus-
ing drowsiness. A visit to the doc-
tor is required. 

What is the safest method for 
tanning during the winter? 

-AnI11IJ7'U11U 

There is no safe method for 
tanning! Skin cancer is on the rise 
in this country and will only 
increase and grow more aggressive 
as we continue to negatively 
impact our environment. One out 
of every eight people will have 
some form of skin cancer in their 
lives. Sun protection in SPF 30 is 
recommended for everyday use on 
exposed areas on the body. Light-
complicated skin types are most at 
risk for skin cancer and are sa-ong-
Iy encounged to protect them-
selves, especially living in a sunny 
town like San Diego. 

Indoor tanning is responsible 
for producing three times the 
amount of abnormal cell growth 
than produced during outdoor tan-
ning. nus means a hastened risk of 
cancer. Smoking while in the sun 
produces toxic effects. Smoking 
interacts with the sun to amplify 
the harmful effects increasing the 
threat of cancer.

Second Triton shutout in two games 
Men's soccer defeats Cal State Stanislaus in 3 .. 0 blanking 
By JOSEPH SPANO 

Co ntributing Writer 

The men's soccer team handily 
beat Cal State Stanislaus on Oct. II 
to improve its California Collegiate 

thletic Association record to 6-4 
and its overall record to 8-4. The 3-
o victory comes just five days after a 
1-0 shutout over UC Davis. 

A rei a tively uneventful first peri-
0d yielded only six shots on goal 
between the teams, but the Tri tons 
maintained possession of the ball 
for the majority of the 45 minutes. 
A fina l push in the last minute of the 
fi rst half nearly netted a goal for the 
Tritons, but after a wide shot, they 
entered halftime in a 0-0 tie. 

In the fi rst 20 minutes of the sec-
ond half, the Tritons really stepped 
it up, scoring two goals nine min-
utes apart. The first goal, at 53 :15, 
was scored by Ali Managhebi, who 
headed in a cross from the right by 
Luke Russell fo r the first of his two 
assists. Jon Krupansky then beat 
CSUS 's goalkeeper one-on-one 
after an assist from Russell , scoring 
the second goal at 62 :58. The final 
goal of the period was scored at 
84:42 by Burke Fathy, who shot in a 
rebound off the goalkeeper from a 

Magnus Lu shot. 
Besides dominating the scoring 

in the game, the Tritons outshot 
CSUS 13-9 and domi nated posses-
sion of the ball, especially at the 
start of the second hal f. T he 
Warriors could not match the speed 
of the Tri tons and always seemed to 
be chasing the ball. 

CSUS also lacked aggressive 
play, rarely having the majority of it 
team on the Tritons' side of the 
field. UCSD, however, played most 
of the game on the Warriors' side of 
the field. 

T he Tritons' ball handling was 
superior to that of CSUS's as well, 
with passes nearly always hitting 
the intended player, while the 
Warriors seemed less deliberate, 
merely passing to a part of the 
fie ld and hoping a teammate 
would be there. 

Russell managed to find open 
teammates throughout the game; 
he assisted two of the three UCSD 
goals. 

"I just put the crosses up, and 
they got them in," Russell said . 
"That is how it has got to work." 

H e wem on to stress that he felt 
the team is coming together, and he 
has hopes for them finishing strong. 

Rebecci OrexterIGuotda! 
Shutting them down: Magnus Lu (No. 6), who had a goal and an assist against 
the Warriors, pushes the ball away from Cal State Stanislaus' .Joe Alex Del Real. 

UCSD head coach Derek 
Armstrong expressed similar senti-
ments, and he also credited the 
Warriors. 

"[CSUS is) a very scrappy 
team, they played with a lot of 

fire," Armstrong said. 
Looking ahead to the Tritons' 

next game on Oct. 26, UCSD wiI.1 
have time to prepare for the last leg 
of its schedule and clinch a trip to 
the conference championships.

match, but also pointed to UCSD's 
depth as being crucial to the week-
end's victories. 

"The key in both matches was 
using a lot of people," McFarland 
said. · We used 14 [players] in the 
match tonight, and they con-
tributed." 

The contributions of several 
players especially stood out, with 
Bonnie Wilson crushing a match-
high 24 kills while hitting .476 , 
Jennie Wilson adding 12 kills and 
12 digs, and Ohta posting 41 assists 
and 22 digs for the match. 

Midway through the CCAA 
schedule, the Tritons have put 
themselves in position to accom-
plish their goals for the year, but to 
do that they must become more 
consistent. 

"We' re really looking to be one 
of the top teams," McFarland 
said. "Our sense is that we play 
really well at times, but we don't 
have everybody playing well at the 
same time yet. We have moments 
where we're great and moments 
where we're just average." 

After a weekend in which two of 
the lesser teams of the CCAA gave 
the Tritons a run, Jennie Wilson 
also stressed that consistency of 
attitude is important. 

·We need to go into every 
game knowing that every team is 
capable of beating every o the r 
team," she said. "The right atti -
tude that every game is a big game; 
that's the key. We have talent that 
can match every other team on the 
court. " 

That talent will be tested as the 
Tritons return home to RIMAC 
Arena on Oct. 18 and Oct. 1 9 to 
play Cal State Bakersfield and Cal 
State Stanislaus. UCSD will look to 
avenge its earlier loss to the CSUS 
Warriors and to prolong its win-
ning streak by playing its best vol-
leyball - consistently.

Tritons push winning 
streak to five games 

Volleyball wins at San Francisco 
State and Sonoma State 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

T he UCSD women's volley-
ball team continued its run of 
impressive play with a pair of vic-
tori es against San Francisco 
State University and Sonoma 
State U niversi ry over the week-
end . The wins bring the Tritons' 
overall record to 15-3, and 9-2 in 
the California Collegiate 
Athletics Conference. UCSD's 
fourth and fifth wins in a row, 
combined with Cal State San 
Bernardino's loss to Cal State 
Los Angeles, mean the Tritons 
are just one game out of first 
place in the hotly contested 
CCAA. 

This UCSD squad clearly had 
momentum on its side when it 
came up against the Gators. 
Despite attacking only .161 to the 
Gators' .371, the Tritons escaped 
with a 30-26 victory in game one. 
T he hapless G ators lacked bite 
for the rest of the evening, and 
even the outstanding night by 
SFSU senior Erinn Kelly - who 
had 16 kills, 21 digs and a .394 
attacking percentage - couldn't 
stop UCSD, which rolled on to 
take the final two games 30-22, 
30-21 . 

The Tritons were led by an 
outstanding all-around perfor-
mance by sophomore outside 
hitter Stacy Dunsmore, who led 
the team with 15 digs, had three 
blocks and added II kills with a 
.385 hitting percentage. Bonnie 
Wilson led the team with 12

kills, Jennie Wilson had five 
blocks and Teresa Ohta and 
Jessica Bartter combined for 41 
assists. 

Despi te the surprising earl y 
challenge from the last-place 
Gators, Dunsmore applauded her 
team for its perseverance. 

"1 think we played as a team 
and stuck it out," she said. "We 
finished it out pretty strong, and 
we have faith that even if we're 
down, we can win ." 

Although maintaining a belief 
that his team would pull 
through, Triton head coach 
Duncan McFarland attributed 
the early struggle to a bit of luck 
for SFSU. 

"It was just one of those 
matches where it seemed like 
everything was going their way," 
he said . 

The following evening 
against Sonoma State, the 
Tritons turned the momentum 
their way and showed no desire 
to play from behind as they 
rushed out to a 30-22 win in the 
first game. The Seawolves 
showed much more tenacity in 
the second game, but UCSD 
fought off several game points to 
take a 36-34 victory. Sonoma 
State was able to pull out a 30-28 
win in the third game, but the 
T ritons recovered to take the 
match with a 30-25 win in the 
fourth game. 

McFarland called the second 
game the turning point of the

Women's soccer maintains 
hold on first place with victory 

Team continues strong play against Warriors 
By CHRISTINE UM 

Contributing Writer 

To stay in first place in the 
California Collegiate Athleti c 
Association, the UCSD women 's 
soccer team needed to win its game 
against Cal State Stanislaus on Oct. 
II. With strong plays in the second 
half, the Tritons were victorious, 2-
I . With its win on OCt. 6 in Davis 
and only five games left in the reg-
ular season , the team looks to fini sh 
as strongly as it started. 

During the first half of the 
game, neither team scored. CSUS 
attempted five shots, but none were 
allowed into the net by UCSD 
goalkeeper Kami Poma. In com-
parison, the Tritons only had one 
shot against the Warriors. The 
Tritons rallied in the last two min-
utes of play to gain several chances 
to score, but all were unsuccessful. 

At halftime, the Tritons went to 
UCSD head coach Brian McManus 
for advice. 

"They [the Warriors) were play-
ing more physically than we were," 
McManus said. 

The visitors, despite their more 
inspiring play, had already commit-
ted eight fouls . 

"1 told them to step up, " 
McManus said . "They needed to 
play like the other team." 

His choice words were just what 
the team needed to hear. 

At the 55:50 mark, Tritons junior 
forward Shannon Harrelson scored 
the first goal of the game on a ball 
mishandled by Warrior goalkeeper 
Breanna Vaughan. 

Minutes later at 59:49, the 
Warriors ' Erin Taylor scored on a

allow. Less than two minutes later, 
Triton midfielder Kristen Conahan 
scored the winning goal with assists 
from Harrelson and fellow mid-
fielder Amy Goker. The Warriors ' 
last attempt to score at 85 :35 was 
c3\Jght by Poma. 

Overall, two of the eight shots 

taken by the Tritons hit the back of 
the net, while the Warriors only 
scored once Ollt of II shots. 

Coming into the game, the 
UCSD women's soccer team was 
tied for first place in the CCAA 
with C al Poly Pomo na. With 
Pomona 's loss on Oct. II , UCSD 
maintains sole possession of first 
place and betters its record to 10-2 .

has been 

• growing on 
my face 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

A t firs t, my friends thought I was just being lazy and not shaving. T he next 
guess was that I was going for the 
rugged look. Now the most popu-
lar theory is that I'm practicing 
being homeless in anticipation of 
life with a political science degree. 
The truth is, I'm doing my duty as 
a loyal sports fa n. 

What's growing on my face is a 
"playoff beard," the kind you 
often see hockey players wear. You 
shave before the playoff~ start and 
shave again when your season is 
over, but it 's part of a bigger c.on-
cept. 

Last year in my humanities 
class, r learned the Latin phrase 
"Do ut des," which means, "r give 
so that you will give." At least, 
that's what my professor tOld 
me. For all I know, it could mean, 
"Your mother sniffs parsley," but I 
digress. 

This sa me concept was 
expressed by Blackalicious at 
Fall Fest. T hey said, "Y'a ll give us 
the energy, and we'll give it right 
back to you." It 's not all about tak-
ing and selfishly hoarding satisfac-
tion out of those who perform; 
there 's a responsi bili ty to give 
back and inspire those who inspire 
us. 

In fact, that's what sirting in the 
front row is all about. If you're 
reading this column, I assume that 
you get a great deal of joy and 
amusement out of sports. So do 
1. But that's not supposed to be 
where the cycle stOps. I take that 
energy and excitement that sports 
give to me and try to express it 
right bade to the players so that the 
joy they take in playing will be 
increased as well. 

Hence: the beard. My beloved 
Gia nts are fighting their way 
through the playoffs and giving 
me hours of enjoyable October 
baseball that relatively few fans 
across the country can have. In 
return, I offer them my support, 
my encouragement and my 
face . The hair is itchy, annoyi ng 
and qui te a sacrifice for me, but as 
long as the Giants las t, so does the 
facial hair. 

"What possible encourage-
ment does a UCS D student 's 
shaving habits have on a profes-
sional baseball team, you won-
der?" 

My response to that is that you 
never know who's reading the 
Guardian. Some clubhouse atten-
dant's nephew may forward him the 
article, and soon it's posted on a 
bulletin board giving Barry and the 
boys enough motivation to take 
them all the way. 

Do ut des. It's not such a bad 
philosophy, and giving a little often 
leads to getting a whole lot more in 
return. Take sirting in the front 
row. You yell and scream and cheer, 
but after a big win you leave feeling 
like a million bucks, and when your 
noise pumped up the home team or 
made the visiting team mess up, it's 
even better. 

Even the facial hair has added 
benefits. After Fall Fest, a bunch

Water polo makes splash at home 
Tritons beat Loyola Marymount Lions, 6~3 
By MIKE SCHOECK 

Contributing Writer 
As the thunder of cheering spec-

tators calmed, the UCSD men's 
water polo team retired to the lock-
er room pleased by their 6-3 victory 
over the Loyola Marymount Lions. 

Focused practices, motivation 
and energy were the forces that 
aided the Tritons against the 
aggressive Lions in a dramatic duel 
on Oct. 11 at Canyonview Pool. 

The victory was definitely a 
team effort, but athletes like goal-
keeper Lance Onken and utility-

players Clark Petersen, Jonathan 
Hopkins, Travis Boettner and 
Ke.lJan Hori sparked the fans and 
kept them cheering throughout 
the game. 

Standout player Petersen rec-
ognized the contributions of the 
entire team. 

"We all came out to play 
tonight," he said. 

According to sophomore goal-
keeper Brian Corbett, rigorous 
practices "focusing on counterat-
tacks and counterdefense" allowed 
the Tritons to play their solid 
game. Six-in-six-out substitutions 

were UCSD head coach Denny 
Harper's formula for success. 

"[The team] executed exactly 
what the coach wanted," freshman 
Mattias Cape said. 

Although the Lions briefly 
managed to lead the Tritons after 
the lone first quarter point was 
scored by LMU's Eric Lefebvre, 
the Lions' initial offensive roar 
quickly turned into a hush. 

The second quarter saw UCSD 
bounce back with a noteworthy 
point scored by Petersen. Boettner 
exhibited strong coordination 
skills, wi th great passes and assists 

the entire game. H ori also scored 
in a penalty shot that resulted in a 
Triton lead of 2-1 over Loyola. 

The referees failed to notice the 
Lions' overly-aggressive pounces 
in the third quarter, but the Tritons 
still kept the lead, with Hopkins 
blasting the ball twice into LMU's 
goal and another shot made by 
Brandon Borso. Steals were made 
by Paul Motschall after a six-in-six-
out substitution by UCSD. 

The Tritons opened the fourth 
quarter with an energized charge 
that resulted in a penalty shot by 
Hopkins. Onken sustained repeat-
ed assaults by the Lions with a 
rapid series of saves. Borso scored 
after Motschall defeated a power-
ful LMU shot with a field block. 
During the final minute of play, 
Wesley Fox of LMU scored, but 
the Tritons eventually prevai led 
with a 6-3 victory. 

Motschall was cited by Harper 
as an improved player, and Onken 
received praise for his seamless 
defense in three quarters of the 
game and only giving up one goal. 

T he stands were packed with 
loyal UCSD fans, despite 
Fall Fest's tempting fun . Dazzled 
fan and Revelle College freshman 
Olivia Tomia narrowed her eyes 
while she examined the stands. 

"Students have a lot of spirit .. . 
and you can see the [UCSD men's 
water polo] team work together 
well ," Tomia said.

ing of seventh-ranked Loyola

UCSD hosts and runs in Triton Classic 
Men's and women's cross country teams win their races 

ByANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

The men 's and women's UCSD 
cross country teams hosted the 
2002 Triton Classic at UCSD's 
North Campus course on Oct. 12. 
Both Triton squads won the team 
competitions in thei r respective 
divisions. 

Hosting a large fie ld of 24 
teams on the men's side and 29 on 
the women's, UCS D head coach 
Ted Van Arsdale expressed why 
the Tritons enjoy the event. 

"We really do it for the local 
community. It is just our way to give 
back to the sport," Van Arsdale said. 

Aside from promoting the uni-
versi ty, Van Arsdale's runners seem 
ed to excel on their home course. 

Running in a field of teams 
from Division I and Division II, 
UCSD's men's team finished in 
third place overall . Senior David 
Dunbar led the Tritons, finishing 
the 8K course in lOth place with a 
time of 25 :40.4. Teammate Neil 
Kalra was close behind, complet-
ing the course in a time of 25:51.5 
to place 14th. 

Other runners that scored 
points for UCSD were junior John 
Morrison, who finished in 32nd 
place, senior Stephen Martin in 
34th place and junior David 
Callister, who took 46th place. 

Running unattached, Thomas 
Loos was the top finisher of the 
men and finished the North 
Campus course in 24:44. 

The women's side finished fifth 
overall out of the 29 teams. 
Individually, senior Audrey Sung 
ended in sixth place with a time of 
22 :19.8. Continuing to lead the 
Tritons, Sung fought her way up 
to the fro nt of the race after run-
ning in the middle of the pack for 
the first half of the event. 

"She's been our No. I," Van 
Arsdale said. "She set the tempo 
for the rest of team." 

The other scorers for the Triton 
women virtually came across the 
finish line together. Sophomore 
Lindsay Stalker took 44th place 
with a time of 23 :42 .9, followed by 
freshman Erin O'Donnell in 46th 
place in 23 :44.6. Freshman Meghn 
Bellotti ended in 51st place and 
junior Lillian Gardiner finished in 
56th place to round out the five 
scorers for UCSD. 

Van Arsdale was pleased to see 
his team run closely together. 

"That has been part of our 
focus during our training," Van 
Arsdale said. "That has been the 
difference ... that tight grouping." 

The Tritons will play host 
again next week at the Alumni 5K 
on Oct. 19, which will be in con-
junction with the UCSD
