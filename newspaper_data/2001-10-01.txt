October dedicated to disabled 
Programs 
to focus on 
abilities 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Associate News Editor 

Numerous events, including 
art exhibits, concerts and film 
screenings are planned for next 
week when UCSD will kick off 
Disability Awareness Month. 

The festivities serve to foster a 

greater understanding and create 
dialogue regarding the disa bled 
and how they overcome daily 
challenges: according to the o rga-
nizers. 

"We want people to become 
aware of the abilities of people 
with disabilities," said Bonnie 
Matheny, a UCSD employee 
rehabilitation counselor. "We try 
to emphasize that if you focus on 
their abi lities, then YOll realize 
that they have a lot to bring to the 
university, to their jobs and to the 
community as a whole." 

Office for Students with 
Disabilities Outreach Assistant 

Tracy Le said there is not enollgh 
awareness ahout people who live 
with disabilities. 

"I don't think a lot of the 
school, the public or the faclilty 
know about people with disabil i-
ties and what they c<l n accom-
plish," she said. 

Le views the upcoming events 
as important to the edllca tion of 
the lIniversity community. 

"I would like students to be 
aware that not everybody at this 
school has all the same capabi li -
ties," Le said. "\Ve need to be

Filner said that after his 20 years of 
eAl>crience as a college profes or, he 
acknowledges the importance of sup-
port staff in keeping a wuversity run-
ning, and for that reason, he said, they 
must be treated with respect. 

"You cannot pay them low wages or 
keep them in temporary positiun, to 
;olve a monetary problem," Filner sa id. 
"You must treat them respectfully, pay 
them resl>cctfully and give them the 
benefits they deserve."

UC5D scientists find 
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's link 

Scientists from UCSD's Department of 
Neurosciences and Pathology, UCSF's Department 
of Neurology, and the Glandstone Institute of 
Neurological Diseases recently found that proteins 

affiliated with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
disease can work with each other to exacerbate the 
degenerative effects of each disease. 

The findings are important because they prove 
that therapies that reduce or block the proteins can 
be more beneficial than previously known. Nearly 
one in three Alzheimer's pa tients develop 
Parkinson's, while some Parkinson's patients also 
develop Alzheimer's. Both are neurological diseases. 

UCSD SCientists Elizer Masliah, Edward 
Rockenstein, Isaac Velnbergs, Yutaka Sagara, 
Margaret Mallory and Makoto Hashimoto workea on 
the projed. The findings were published in the 
Proceedings of the Notional Academy of Science on 
Sept. 25. 

510 researcher discovers new 
forms of life on ocean floor 

Herbert Staudigel of the SCriPPS Institution of 
Oceanography, along WIth researchers from 
Norway and Canada, report In the Sept. 28 edition 
of Geochemistry. GeophYSICS, Geosystems that 
they have apparently found the bottom of the biOS-
phere. 

They found evidence of microbes eating 
through rock alterations in lava rock, called glass. 
This was discovered by drilling four miles below 
sea level. Prior to the discovery, it was thought 
that there was no biological activity, just chemical 
and physical activity in ocean-bottom rock forma-
tions. 

The alterations in which the microbes were 
found are important because the chemical interac-
tions between rock and sea water influence the 
carbon cycle process that affeds the earth's cli-
mate.

DISASTER 

In the wake of tragedy at 
home, Americans forget 
humanitarian efforts abroad 

By CLAIRE •• VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

It's an apple-cheeked tru ism 'often 
quotcd by perky people looking to cheer 
someone up: "When you smile, the 
whole world smiles with you, but when 
you cry, you cry alone." 

Such is clearly not the case fo r 
America . Over the past weeks, the 
"whole world" is sharing in our tragedy. 
T he leaders of nearly every nation in the 
worl d have expressed their condolences 
for the events of Sept. 11 . Indeed, the 
citizens of many nations are grieving 
with the ame intensity as Americans, as 
if in ternational borders matter little 
when people are faced with such devas· 
ta ting and pointles loss of life. 

One would like to thmk that is actu-
ally the case. 

Unfortu nately. such politics- free 
concern for the well-bei ng of others 
rarely materia lizes among Americans 

these days. Our country's persistent 
strain of isolationism has long led us to 
ignore many of the troubles of the rest 
of the world. Or, when we do get 
involved, we are guided more by politi-
cal and economic aims than by a nation-
ality-blind desire to assist people in 
need. 

With all the instability in countries 
and regions all over the world, it is more 
important than ever that Americans pay 
attention to humanitarian disasters, and 
that we not only lend our sympathy and 
empathy, but also our help. T his, to be 
truly effective, must be done without 
regard to poli tica l concerns. 

Instead, our care and assistance 
should come from a deep respect for the 
intrinsic value of human li fe . This is 
omething in which Americans are rich 

when it comes to our friends and neigh-
bors, but which must be extended indef-
initely to include everyone on th is lone-
ly blue and green island. 

Every year, countries are hit hard by 
natural disasters: earthquakes in Turkey, 
mudslides in Latin America and flood-
ing in India being some recent examples. 
Federal organizations such as the U.S. 
Agency for International Development 
and private donors are quick to send 
money and supplies to help ailing coun-
tries, which are often not developed 
enough to provide for adequate disaster 
relief on their own. 

Of course, to say that American 
attention toward such disasters is 
minuscule compared to the interna-
tional outpouring of love and support 
we have received in the last three weeks 
would be quite an understatement 
indeed. Few Americans give to organi-
zations designed to help, and few feel a 
personal loss over those thousands of 
deaths, perhaps because they seem very 
far, indeed, from thei r own backyard. 
T his atti tude - that the only issues 
deserving of attention are those that 

directly influence us - is at the root of 
our unwillingness to make extra effort 
to assist those in need in far-off coun-
tries. 

The issue is further complicated in 
situations where it is not an act of God, 
but political situations that create 
humanitarian crises. The U.S. govern-
ment often finds itself torn about how to 
use its power and influence on the inter-
national scene. On the one hand, some 
argue we must promote. democracy and 
place sanctions on nations with bad 
human rights records or despotic lead-
ers. Others point out that sanctions do 
little to change these situations for the 
better, and itutead demonize the coun-
tries imposing them and lead to even 
worse conditions.

Issues 
like to 

discuss in a serious 
and thought-provok-
ing manner. But 
first, I want to talk 
about the season 
premier of "Friends:' 

For the record, [ would like to 
sta te that [ do not watch this show 
bec,llIse of its pop culture subject 
matter, or because Ilike to live vic-
ariously th rough the relationships 
of overly skinny people. 

When I watch "Friends," [ do so 
fo r ItS mtellecnlal and provocative 
content , such as wh at it rea ll y 
means to be "on a brea k." Plus, I 
thlllk Matthew Perry is kinda cute. 

Anyway, as everyone and her 
mother knows by now, Rachel -
the diny blondc who isn't Phoebe 
- is officially pregnant and intends 
to keep the baby. 

But Monica, the brunette with 
obsessive compu lsive diso rder, 
raised an interesting question : ' 
"[ [ow, in this day and age, could a 
woman possibly get pregnant by 
accident?" In other words: How 
could you be such a dumbass? 

I have always been a major fan 
of birth control. Even befo re [ 
knew how babies were made, [ was 
actively endorsi ng contraceptives at 
my parents' dinner parties. 

No, I'm serious. 
Yes, there was a ti me when my 

parents were actually real people 
who had rea l friends who liked to 
eat together. T hose days are, of 
course, long gone; my parents have 
since transformed ioto O ld People, 
who are not rea lly members of the 
huma n race at all. 

[ distinctly remember one din-
ner party my parents had with a 
young couple whom we shall call 
"Bob" and "Mary" for the sake of 
anonymi ty (thei r names are rea lly 
Jake and Susan). 

Bob and Mary had recently gOt-
" ten married and were very much in 

love, so my parents decided that it 
would be best to banish me to my 
bedroom so they would remain that 
way. 

With promise of ice cream in 
the morning if I stayed out of the 
living room, [ was ushered out of 
the presence of the two guests. But 
was I going to stay in my room? 
Hell 710, not a little social butterfly 
like me. 

So after about 10 minutes I flit-
tered (yes, flittered) into the living 
room and plopped myself right 
smack-dab in the center of the 
couch, a spot that coincidentally 
also happened to be between Bob 
and Mary. 

Now, I think [ sbou[d take a 
moment here to talk about my 
pajamas. [ may have the fashion 
sense of-a wombat, but I know my 
PJs, and when I was 4 years old, I 
had the coolest ones in the world. 
They were the kind that has a zip-
per from your neck to your hips. Of 
course, the best part was tha t they 
ca me with the feet already attached. 
You just stepped into them, zipped 
them up and you were good to go, 
baby. God, those were cool. 

So there [ was, sitting next to 
Bob and Mary (whose names, keep 
in mind, are really Jake and Susan), 
With my pajama-covered feet dan-
gl i ng over thc side of the couch. It

Reading the Monday, Sept. 24 

is uc of the Guord,all , I was rea lly 
offended by the ads for Sony 

Screenblast.com that were pub-
Ii hed. 

Sony's advertising used pho-
tographs of attractive young men 
and women - with headings that 
read "Use me," "Manipulate me," 
"Share me," "Enter me" - to 
market its newest product. 

[ found it particula rly ironic 
that the "share me" one was posi-
tioned alongside an article on how 
pornography leads to vi olence 
aga inst women.

our mIstake, the United States was 
quick to rebuild Europe and Japan 
after that second war. In the 
process , we made longsta nding 
friends 3nd allies out of fonm:r 
enemIes. 

In the 19805, the Soviet nion 
attacked Afghanistan . Although 
we were slow on the uptake, the 
United tates finally gave m<1ten-
31 3id and training to the Afghan 
fighter, . In the proccs" we 
trained Jnd supported OS<1m3 bin 
Laden . 

Against all odds, Afghanistan 
pn:va iled agains t the mighty 
Soviet army, ultimately le3ding to 
the downf311 of the Sovit!t Union. 
Thi s wOllld certainly qualify 
Afghanistan as a nahlral ally, at the 
very least. 

nd how did we repay 
Afghanistan ' We went away and 

too excited, because it was clear 
that Bob did not own PJ s this cool,

But you know, sometimes they

Bob was understandably quite 
taken aback by this information, 
si nce he no doubt considered my 
PJs to be immaculate symbols of 
perfection. 

I'd also like to think that he was 
rather impressed with the fact that

Under the circumstances, the

After the Soviet downfall, it

term "vagina" correctly. 
Bob stared at Mary in horror, 

who stared back in equal shock. 
Then, quite suddenly, Bob and 

Mary had to go, due to "prior 
engagements" they had suddenly 
remembered. 

I don't remember the details, 
but Bob and Mary never came 
over to our house for dinner again. 

According to the sources of my 
pa rents, the couple never had chil-
dren. For some reason, I t11ink 
they just felt that they wcren't 
ready for kids. 

You ee, even at the tender age 
of 4, I was a walking advertisement 
for birth control. Had Rachel real -
ized what a tricl,), thing pajamas 
can be, I think the plot of 
"Friends" wOllld have gone a bit 
differently. 

So basically, I tricked you into 
reading this cntire thing with my 
little introduction about 
"Friends." Let that be a lesson to 
you: Never trust a woman who 
wears pajamas with feet. 

Humanitarian: 
PhilanthroRY should 
continue after tragedy 
continued from page 4 
well to re-evaluate this stance and 
consider the impact our dccisions 
have on actual quality of life for 
people living in th'C countries we 
deny supplies and goods. 

The past few years have also 
seen growing populations of 
refugees, as is now the case in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan. 

The United Nations has esti-
mated that the cost of aiding these 
refugees - who have fled t11eir 
homes believing that American 
bombs will soon fall ovcr them -
will total over $600 million. Where 
is t11e fund for donations toward 
this effort? Is American reticence 
toward assisting all people nega-
tively affected by the acts of violent 
extremists due to indifference' 
That cannot be true, because 
Americans have shown themselve 
to be generous in giving to the 
relief efforts on our own soil. This 
generosity must be extended out-
side our borders. 

Maybe it's idealistic and naive to 
suggest that we should give of our 
great bounty to help all people In 
need, whether they're citizens of 
nations with which we agree or dis-
agree, nations t11at are our allie or 
our enemies. 

But whether it's possible or nor, 
it should be something to which we 
aspire. To show the same respect to 
value of human life no matter race, 
religion, creed, ideology or nation-
ality - isn't that one of the central 
tencts of our culture? In fact, it's a 
major part of what makes America 
a great country . 

We Americans have 0 much, 
and perhaps the thing we take most 
for granted is our security that we 
will nOt be stricken with over-
whelming famine or an insur-

mountable natural disaster - after 
all, even in Ncw York, the quality of 
the engineering behind the World 
Trade Center held each of the tow-
ers steady for nearly an hour after 
the planes' respective impacts, 
allowing thousands to escape from 
the lower floors. And now, 111 the 
wake of the domestic disaster, our 
hospitals have the technolo!,'Y' sup-
plies ami staff to treat the injured; 
our infrastructure is strong enough 
to provide the services that will 
piece that city, and our nation, back 
together. 

To take that for granted, to for-
get that the vast majority of people 
in the world do not have these lux-
uries and securities, would be a 
gross injustice to those people, and 
to ourselves. 

Don't misinterpret this - thi is 
not a call for Americans to renounce 
the capitalist lifestyle we so enJoy, to 
sell our sport utility vehicles and fine 
homes and jewelry and designer 
clothing and send all but what we 
need to those at the other end of the 
wealth spectrum. Such a course of 
action is for few, and those who fol -
low it arc hailed as saints but little 
imitated in the West. 

Instead, let liS begin where we 
can, where we are comfortable. 
An1ericans have scl Oessly donated 
money and clothing and time to 
help the disaster relief in ew 
York . What if the giving continue 
after the rubble is cleared on the 
home front? 

We can help; that much is clear. 
ow all that is wanting is our com-

mitment. Americans have been 
inspired to reach into their hearts 
and give condolences to the fami-
lies of t1lOse affected by the attacks; 
we have reached into our pockets to 
give much-needed financial sup-
·port. We have discovered the satis-
faction that comes from knowing 
that our energies are going toward 
something constructive and posi-
tive. That satisfaction doesn't have 
to stop.

Ashcroft introduces plan to search student records 
Some fear that Middl~ Eastern students will experience excessive searches 

BERKELEY, Calif. - U.S. 
Attorney General John Ashcroft 
has asked Congress to consider a 
plan that would give federal offi-
cia ls extensive access to shldents' 
private records in the wake of the 
terrorist attacks. 

The plan would allow govern-
ment ollicials to earch students' 
r~cords without their knowledge or 
consent. 

If probable cause can be shown, 
officials from the federal depart-
ments of Education and Justice will 
hc able to examine a student's 
records for' past "acts of tension 
toward America." 

Because one of the terrorists 
had entered the United tates with 
a student visa, a Justice Department 
spoke person said the federal gov-
ernment needs more information 
about students' records and activi-
ties.

Tornado 
strikes U. 
of Maryland 
Many students 
displaced, $15 
million in damage 

COLLEGE PARK, Md. -
Preliminary assessments have esti-
mated on-campus damages caused 
by last Monday's tornado at about 
$15 million, University of 
,\IIaryland officials said Wednesday. 

Damages at University 
Courtyard are expected to cost 
about S 1.5 million, according to 
Campus spokesman George 
Cathcart. 

Facilities management officials 
and the Maryland Emergency 
Management Agency inspected 
North Campus facilities on 
Wcdnesday and found roof, win-
dow and door damages in most of 
the bui ldings. 

Though the campus is protect-
ed under the state's self-insurance 
plan, which wi ll cover most of the 
costs, officials said they are in the 
process of applying for federal dis-
aster aid . Franlc Brewer, assistant 
vice president for faci lities manage-
ment, said it will be several weeks 
before final damage figures will be 
available. 

Trai lers that temporari ly 
housed the Maryland Fire and 
Rescue Institute, located behind 
the C larice Smith Performing 
Arts Center, suffered the most 
damage. The campus is unlikely 
to reconstruct the trailers, Brewer 
said. 

Work on the collapsed roof in 
the back of North Woods Buffet 
began Tuesday and will likely take 
four weeks to fix, Brewer said. T he 
buffet will remain closed during 
that time. 

"All the cleanup has gone very 
well and very quicldy," Cathcart 
said . "So many agencies came to 
help." 

Buildings at the Courtyard were 
most heavily damaged by the 
storm. More than 700 students 
were evacuated from the seven 
buildings on its site.

had enrolled last fall at Holv 
ames College in Oaldand, ali r:. . 

to study English. He had made 
preparations to move in with a ho~t 
family, but never showed up for 
c1asscs. 

But the U.S. Student 
Association, a national student lob-
bying organization, said Ashcroft's 
proposal gives a green light for fed-
eral officials to unnecessarily look 
at students' private records .. 

"(The law would) violate a Shl-
dent's right to privacy," said Allen 
Parker, U .S. Student Association 
spokesperson. "Besides, it will be 
hard for [federal officials] to deter-
mine if a student is a terrorist just 
by random facts ." 

A Justice Department official 
said files will not be opened on 
random whims. First, probable 
cause must be given, and even if 
the files are looked at closely, only 
important aspects will be 

searched - not school-related 
information .

disabilities so peopll: feci free and 
comfortable with talking to them 
and finding out more about them, 
and learn from that," Matheny 
said. 

Discussion among artists and 
those in anendance is integral in 
understanding the chall enges 
people with disabilities face and 
to realize the inspiring ways they 
are abll: to overcomc it, said 
Maggie Hou lihan , forme r presi-
dent of Community Advocates fo r 
Disability Rights ,lIld Education. 

"[The artists) will be there to 
explain their art and how they use 
it for therapy," Matheny said. 

To Le, the program offers a 
forum for people t!J educate them-
selves and be enligh lened. 

"It is inspiring to see people 
with obstacles work around [them) 
and still live the ame life as some-
one without an}' of those obsta-
cles," she sa id . 

In addition to Illusic and art, 
free filrn~ will be screened. "Simon 
Birch" will be shown Tuesday at 7 
p.m. and 10 p.lII . III the Price 
Center Theater. 

The 1999 Academy Award-win-
ning documentary "King Gimp" 
will also be shown. The film docu-
ments how Dan Keplinger, a 27-
year-old with cerehral palsy, com-
municates through painting 
because talking is nea rly impos ible 
for him. It will be shown Thursday, 
Oct. -+ at 5 p.m. in the Cross 
Cultural Center. 

On OCt. 19 there will be a lec-
ture on stern cell re,earch in the

"1 hope people will cOllle away 
with the idea that ev.erybody has a 
different level of skills which have 
fa r less to do wi th ability than with 
interest and ta lent," Houlihan 
said. "People need to realize we 
are all individuals. Disabil iti es are

Students conduct energy .. saving experiment 
Madison High School sponsors research on new non toxic fuel alternative 
By LAUREN POPP 
Staff Writel 

With ever-increasing energy prices 
and the end of our supply of petroleum an 
mevitable threat, more and more alterna-
tive energy and fuel sources arc being 
considered for the future. Madison High 
School in Clairemont is leading the way in 
experimenti ng with just such a resource 
that, if supported further, could be a solu-
tion. 

In the last few years, biodiesel, a com-
bination of vegetable oil , methanol and 
lye, has been experimented with as an 
alternative file I for diesel engines. Greg 
Quinn , dutomechanics instructor for 
Madison High School 's Regional 
Occupation Program Autoshop and for-
mer UCSD transportation services 
mechanic, began working with his stu-
dents to produce his own version upon 
learning of biodiesel's many benefits. 

In his research, he found that biodiesel 
i not only a completely renewable, non-
tOXIC alternative, it's also a means of recy-
cling used vegetable oil that would nor-
mally be taken to a landfill. 

"A large restaurant gets rid of 500 gal-
lons of vegetable oil in a month, 90 per-
cent of which can be reclaimed, filtered 
and used tq. make biodiesel," Quirin 
explained. 

Furthermore, used or unused, the veg-
ctable oil can be taken from any number 
or sources ranging fro m soy bean to 
canola oil. 

What furth er distinb'Uishes biodiesel 
frolll Mandard dIesel fu el IS Its drastica lly 
lower emIssIons rates, whIch translates to 
a much more environmentally re ponsi-
ble fue l source. Its only by-product is 
glycerin and it has between 40 to 60 per-
cent lower emis ions of government-reg-
ulated by-products such as carbon 
monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulates 
o'r soot. 

Biodiesel can also be used in any diesel 

engine without requiring any modifica-
tions or conversions to the engine. 

"Another advantage is the lubricating 
effect biodiesel has that has been shown to 
increase engine life," added instructional 
aide Daniel McKinley. 

Motivated by the promising results of 
his study of biodiesel, Quirin set out to 
create a biodiesellab within the autoshop. 
G ui'ded only by information offered in 
Jo hua Trickell 's book on biodiesel, "From 
the Fryer to the Fuel Tank," Quirin and 
his students were able to manufacture 
their own biodiesel for around 80 cents 
per gallon using linle more than a trolling 
motor and a steel drum. 

"I tell the students that if you can bake 
a cake, you can make biodiesel," Quirin 
said. 

The fairly simple..process requires only 
two ingredients beyond vegetable oil: lye 
and methanol, which are required to cre-
ate a catalyst for the reaction necessary to 
produce the fuel. 

Not satisfied with merely producing 
biodiesel, Quirin decided to challenge 
his students further and put their fuel to 
real-life application. The result after 
nearly a year of work and experimenta-
tion was the "Veggie Volvo," a Volvo 760 
equipped with a diesel engine made by 
the students in the autoshop. Quirin and 
his students entered the Veggie Volvo in 
the 2001 Del Mar Fair, taking home first 
place for Transportation Group Project 
as well as an environmental awareness 
award. 

The recognition and recent media 
coverage of the project has helped earn 

_ grants from groups such as the Greater 
San Diego Educational Industry 
Counsel. 

"In the United States there's only a 
handful of universi ti es researching 
biodiesel," Quirin said. "We're probably 
the only known high school that not only

MONDAY, OCTOBER 1,2001 

Culture: 
UCSD will continue 
involvement in program 
Continued from 'page 9 
Chmese culture and society. 

I began seeing cultural differences 
right away. It was hard not to notice 
that young girls in China are much 
more affectionate with each other 
than Americans are. After getting to 
know rwo of the locals our group met 
at a university, they starred walking 
right next to me, with our shoulders 
touching. I was rather Aanered that 
Lucy and Cher felt so comfortable 
with me, but in 95 degree weather I 
wanted some breathing space. 

AJong with seeing the usual 
tourist attractions, the Americans 
were able to visit a university and 
meet some of the students. 
University life in China has some 
similarities to American college life, 
but also many differences. One tu-
dent, Van, told me that the amount 
6f time a student spends studying is 
up to them, but tha t Chinese stu-
dents are in class about eight hours a 
day, five days a week - much more 
time than Americans are used to. 

The dorm life is also much dif-
ferent. tudents are not allowed in 
the dorms of members of the oppo-
site sex. AJ 0, ix people live in each 
room , and the room are small : 
only a linle bit larger than ISO 
~quarc feet to hold three bunks and 
u,ually one or two desks. 

Erica Cazare , a snldent on the 
tour from Long Beach ta te 
University, asked Van what Chmese 
I,.TJ IYS thought of Amencan girls. He 
said politely, "Anlcrican girls are 
much stronger than Chinese girls." 

Cities in China are highly popu-
lated, and due to this density, I aw 
everal traffic accidents, including 

bike-on-bike accidents. Something 
that was hard tor us 'l'\!nericans to 
comprehend wa the fact that in 
China, it seems to be that the big-
ger vehicle has the right of wa y. 

My second night in China I saw a 
bit'}'clist get rear-ended by a car. 
The driver got out of his car and 
looked at his bumper, then drove off. 
Luckily for the bicyclist, the only 
damage was to his bike, because in 
China, the bicyclist would have been 
held responsible for any damages. 

Overall, the trip wa amazing. 
The country is beautiful and safe. 1 
didn 't feel the need to keep every-
thing under close watch as one does 
when traveling in Europe. The 
people were very nice and would 
often approach Americans, wanting 
to have their picture taken with us. 

Loren Thompson, assistant vice 
chancellor of Snldent Educational 
Advancement at UCSD, initiated the 
school's involvement with the pro-
gram. He said of the trip, "The 
greatest cultural difference was how 
extremely friendly the people were. 
Everywhere we went, if you smiled at 
someone, people were ready to smile 
back." 

A trip like this would be especial-
ly interesting for people who like 
history and different culnlres. Chi na 
is full of ancient traditions. For me, 
it was incredible to go through the 
cities, see the things that I had 
learned about and visit the places 1 
studied that are now tourist aurac-
tions. For once, the things I heard 
about in my Making of the Modern 
World courses had a purpose. 

1 have heard about trips such as 
this advertised for UCSD students, 
such as one to Israel for students of 
the Jewish faith. 1 encourage every-
one to look into these programs 
because they really are a great bar-
gain. Altogether, the airfare, hotels 
(these really were four and five stars) 
and meals were included for less than 
the airfare alone would have been if 
we ' had booked it on our own. The 
experience was well wonh the cost 

For Thompson, this is not the 
end of this program. KUCSD is 
definitely going to work with 
Legends of China again," he said. 
Giving more students the opportu-
nity to experience what I did and ... 
find theIr own personal peace 
abr,oad.

THE EDITOR'S 
SOAPBOX 

Don't be 50 
impressed 
by my Rubik's Cube 
Recitation in biology and engineering is 
not an implication of intelligent thought 
ByEDWU 
Design Editor 

I recently learned &om a friend 
while on a trip to Washington, 
D.C. exactly how to solve a Rubik's 
Cube, regardless of state. It takes 
me understanding of a few simple 
concepts, in two dimensions, of 
how pieces move around me cube, 
and memoril.ing a fairly intuitive 
sequence of about 32 . 

The ridiculous thing is mat I 
don't understand the cube whatso-
ever. If someone were to hand me 
a cube, -and ask me to place it in 
some arbitrary configuration, the 

nly result I could produce would 
be the canonical one. What this 
illustrates is me fact that what I've 
basically done is memorize the 
solution of someone who actually 
comprehend me problem at hand, 
and conceptualized it to me point 
where someone like me only has to 
mink in two dimensions instead of 
four. 

I've learned the solution for all 
outward appearences, but in reality, 
I understand very little of how the 
inner workings of the thing actual -
ly work. Even worse, I've created 
no solutions - there's no mought 
involved anymore when I solve the 
mingo It 's all recitation. 

The Rubik's Cube is a great 

analogy, then, for my academics at 
this university thus far (and proba-
bly for a long time to come). 

Taking computer science and 
physics courses means a lot of solv-
ing Rubik's Cubes: We learn neat 
little equations or programming 
techniques that represent the nat-
ural world in our math and engi-
neering classes, see examples of 
how mey work, follow them and 
get passing grades in our classes. 
It's one big game of "monkey see, 
monkey do." While some physics 
problem can look huge and ugly, 
rare is the problem mat has a non-
intiutive answer that is at once sim-
ple, elegant and creative. 

Most of the time, due to the 
realities of the way students must 
learn the material, we are forced 
through canonical methods over 
and over again, much like my prac-
tice with the Rubik's Cube (I can do 
it under 4 minutes now, by the 
way). And this is fine and perfectly 
good - when we engineers gradu-
ate and go out into the "real 
world," engineering majors (and 
doctors, for you biology major out 
there) get paid ridiculous amollnts 
of money to follow canonical solu-
tions (though they may differ 
!,rreatly in context) to a lee.

Soapbox: 
Monetary wealth is not 
academic worth 
Continued from page 13 

\Yha t I cannot stand. however. 
" when ,111 cnglllcertng or biology 
or economIcs major will mistake 
the higher starting salary of their 
dlsclpline's graduates for increased 

level~ of presitge and intelligence. 
1'111 tired of heanng thea ter. 
F nglish 'lI1d political sCIence majors 
(Joh in amazement and say. "wow, 

tha t '~ a hard major" when I say 
wha t I do at this university. because 
our ~ociety (and for that I';'aner our 
own university) equivocates wealth 
in profession wi th true objective 
worth. 

The truth is. as much as snide 
engineeri ng or science majors will 
tell you otherwise. what we do is no 
more difficult than the hours an 
English or political science major 
must invest in a paper, or a theater 
major must invest in a production. 

I personally hold the arts. 
humanities and socia l sciences as a 
whole in much higher esteem than 
the reci tated science at the under-
graduate level (more on higher aca-
demics later). \-\lhy? It 's because 
these majors are forced to produce 
creative, nonintuitive output on a 
conti nual basis for excellence. 

In a lower-division mathematics 
course. if you can recite something 
at 70 percent accuracy you'll be 
near the top of your class. I find 
this absurd. The only reason people 
perceive "the sciences" as any more 
di fficulr in our modern society is 
that there are a great many people 
whose talents do not fall within the 
realms of the engineering or biolo-
gy major. These people have cho-
sen these majors for socioeconomic 
reasons of "prestige" and money. 

aspll'lng doctor if it's the money 
and prestige motivating him and 
you're likely to get some answer 
about a great concern for the well-
being of others - but what if we 
paid our doctors $30.000 per year 
and our teachers $120.000? 

The truth is that no matter how 
much people profess what their 
actual intents are. ocloeconomlc 
concerns wtll motivate a drive for a 
choice of profession and major 
(though I'm not saying there 's any-
thing wrong with that; it's how eco-
nomics works intrinsically). I'm 
willing to bet that if computer sci-
ence turns into an unromantic 
prospect (say. an average graduate 
garners $24.000). that the glut of 
people in my math. CSE and ECE 
courses who barely recite material 
and then go off to complain to their 
English and political science 
friends about the complexity of the 
material at hand would disappear. 

The saddest thing about this. 
however. is not that we devalue per-
fectly valid and. in truth. beautiful 
subjects such as rhetoric and history. 
No, the sad thing is that in pursuit of 
greed. people complain and recite 
the material. but they never under-
stand it. much less realize that it is as 
beautiful in its complexity as poeoy 
or any classical work. 

Now. don't get me wrong about 
sciences and engineering: I have a 
great amount of respect for my pro-
fessors and those graduate and 
undergraduate students in my major 
who are driven to constantly take 
what they learn, turn it over in their 
heads and unravel the puzzles that 
make up the intrinsic laws of nature 
and man-made puzzles like digital 
logic. At its core. the laws of relativ-
ity are as incomprehensibly beautiful 
as the poems of W. B. Yeats. It·s 
annoYing and sad to watch many 
people wonder whether they can get 
throllgh this material in four years so 
they can start going out to pursue 
careers and make money - and 
deride their peers around them 
whose talents and interests fall in

Such a statement reveals how 
new and relativel y unknown 
biodiesel is and th~refore how 
unique Quirin's program is. 

As awareness about biodiesel 
spreads. it's becoming clear that its 
role in the future has great poten-
tial. B'iodiesel is compatible with 
any diesel engine; therefore. it 
could potentiall y power boats. 
buses. trucks and even power plants 
that run off a large diesel engine. 
The government has already begun 
using biodiesel in fleets. and in sev-
eral pans of the country. public 
buse are being powered by the 
vegetable-based fuel as well. 

The trend may catch on fur-
ther. as a large-scale cOllversion of 
vehicle engines from petroleum-
hased fuel dependence to relying 
on some sort of alternative fuel 
source is unavoidable in the near 
futu re.

have to meet federal and sta te emis-
sions standards and current diesel 
engines are not clean-running 
enough to pass these standards." 
Quirin explained. 

He also said that compared with 
other options such as natural gas or 
cars powered by electricity. 
biodiescl is a much more viable 
choice: atural ga~ is a limited 
resource and cannot be used with-
out expensive conversions for 
engines. and electric cars have yet 
to be perfected. 

So what's next for Quirin and 
his research? He has set his sight 
on a more efficient vehicle 
intended to run only on biodiesel. 
With the help of a Perkins grant 
for vocational classes at the high 
school . Quirin said he plans to 
take a "small. efficient engine 
from a Volkswagen Rabbit and 
adapt it into a custom kit car with 
hopes of achieving 45-50 miles to 
a gallon running on vegetable 
oil." The Veggie Volvo currently 
gets approximately 25 miles to 
the gallon. so Quirin has high 
hopes. 

Financial support seems to be 
hi largest ob tacle. becau c the 
project is currently funded primar-
ily by donations received from 
work the autoshop students per-
form on the shop's cars.

MONDAY, OCTOBER I, 2001 

Because: 
M LB about to wrap up 
another exciting year 
Continued from page 20 
to that of McGwire. Bonds is hit-
ting home runs in a park that was 
designed (or him, with a short 
porch in right and a breeze usual -
ly blowing out. He also has the 
luxury o( hitting homers in great 
hitter ' parks like Coors Field and 
Enron Field. Yes, Big Mac got to 
hit some homers at Coors, but 
new scheduling rules have Barry 
playing extra games in Colorado 
this year. 

Additionally, Bonds has the 
luxury o( a team behind him. 
Players lIke Rich urilia. Jeff 
Kent . Andres ,alarraga and J.T. 

t " w assure that Bond gets 
. pitches to hit. Big Mac hit a on 

hi own. Edge' Big Mac. 
Aside from the whole home run 

chase, this has been a very exctting 
yea r in baseball. Alex Rodriguez 
was crowned the first quarter-bil-
han dollar man. and has lived up to 
his paycheck - as much as a person 
can when making that kind of 
m<?ne), - with a career yea r. A-Rod 
set a single- eason record for most 
homers b)' a hortstop and IS cur-

- rendy chasing the 50-home run 
plateau. 

An A-Rod-Iess Mariners team 
defied the odds to run awav with 
the .Amencan League WeSt and 
spOrt the best record in the 
majors. Contributions from Brett 
Boone, who t enjoying a ca reer 
yea r, and rooloe sensa tion Ichiro 
Suzuki have provided a huge spark 
for the Mariners. 

At week 's end. Ichiro set the 
single-season record for hits by a 
rooloe and was sporting a batting 
average of .350. ThiS is the feel-
good team of the season and has 
once again proven that team soli-
danty can overcome JUSt about all 

QUICK fURS \RO{lSD 

odds. 
In the National League, pen-

nanr fever is everywhere. Heading 
inro last week, there were eight 
teams that had legitimate shots at 
making the playoffs. one of 
these teams were more of a senti -
mental favorite than the lew 
York Mets, who rebounded from 
the World Trade Cenrer attack 
and have been the hottest team in 
baseball since. Unfortunately for 
New Yorkers, the Mets were vir-
tually eliminated by game-ending 
homers off of the bat of Brian 
Jordan. 

Personally, my team for the 
playoffs is going to be the Yankees. 
I have a new appreciation for the 
Bronx Bomber . Aftcr everything 
that has gone on in the past few 
weeks, I think that Yankee fans 
deserve this. 

This sea on has not only been 
about the young and upstart teams 
like the Mariner~ - a couple of old 
men have receml} grabbed head-
lines with record chases and retire-
mem annollncemem~. 

Rickey I lender on will likely 
reach the 3,OOO-hit plateau and 
break Tv Cobbs' all-time runs 
cored record this year. Entenng 

Sunday, he only needed two hits 
and one run to tie the marks. T hIS 
solidi fies an already brilliant 
career for the first hailot Ilall of 
Famer. 

Speaking of first ballor, two of 
baseball'~ elder tatesmen, Cal 
Rlpke.n Jr. and Tony Gwynn, have 
announced plans to retire after this 
sea on. Each has enjoyed a farewell 
tour that mcluded cere montes hon-
onng them at every ballpark they 
visited. 

Well , those are my random 
rambling, about the year in M ajor 
League Baseba ll. Take from It 
what you will. If yOIl don't like tI . 
then tough. This IS my cul umn 
and I will write about whatever I 
want to.

junior defender Ryan Powers 
launched a long throw-in into the 
Trito~ penalty box, junior Tyler 
Nelson crossed the ball to the far 
POSt to a waiting Vau, who 
slammed the ball into [he top of 
the net to stake the Aggics to a 1-0 
lead . 

The lead was short-lived, how-
ever, because UCSD answered 
back in the 60th minute with a 
goal from sophomore Ryan 
Mizumoto. Mizumoto received a 
eros from freshman David Ower 

. and pounded it off of a UC Davis 
defender to knot the game at one-
all. 

Following the tying goal, th(! 
two defenses stepped it up a notch 
and kept the match scoreless over 
the next 51 minutes. 

It wasn't unti l the I I I th minute 
of the game that Triton sophomore 
defender Ryan Blair ended the

'nlC UCSD women's volleyba ll 
tcam enjoyed sole posses ion of 
fim place in the alifornia 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
following a Sonoma Srate upset of 
California State University 
133kersfield on Friday night. 

Unfortunately for the Tritons, 
thdt position was short-lived fol-
lowing a defeat at the hands of 
I o. 6-ranked California State 
Uiliversiry San Bernardino on 
Saturday night in San Bernardino. 

UC D, which fell to 6-1 in the 
CCAA and 11 -3 overall, now finds 
Itself in a three-way tie for the top 
,pot in the CCAA with Cal State 
Bakersticld and Cal tate an 
Bernardino. 

The loss was the end of an oth-
erwise strong week of CCAA 
:lCllon for UC D, which had ear-
lier defeated Cal Poly Pomona 
and Grand Canyon University in 
convincing fashion . 

Saturday night'S match against 
the Coyotes was billed as a clash of 
the titans. It was the No. 6 team in 

th ~ country, Cal State San 
Bernardino, versus the No. 21 
team in the country, the Tritons. 
Though the Trit<>ns put up a solid 
fi ght , the Coyotes proved toO 
milch for UCSD, winning the 
malch 3-1 at Coussoulis Arena. 

Ca l State San Bernardino, 
which improved to 8-1 in the 
C:CAA and 16-1 overall, jumped 
mil early and took the first ga me 

30-26. The Tritons rallied back 
for a 30-26 win in the second 
game before the Coyotes slammed 
the door with 30-27 and 30-23 
victories in the final twO games. 

"Every si ngle player ha~ 
stepped up their play to a higher 
level," said Ca l State San 
Bernardi no head coach Kim 
Cherniss. "They played with poise 
and intensity. " 

In the absense of All -American 
middle blocker Kim 
Morohunfola, who is sidelined for 
the next rwo to four weeks wi th a 
knee injury, the Coyotes received 
a huge game from sophomore 
Kim Ford. Ford recorded an 
amazing match-high 31 kills to go 
along- with 22 digs to lead Cal 
State San Bernardino. ener Amy 
Pope added 58 assists to the win-
ning effort. 

The 31 kills put Ford second 
on the Coyotes' all-time ingle-
match kill list, just one behind the 
mark of 32, set by Nicole Wasson 
against Chico State in 1995 and 
equaled by All-American Jamie 
Liefveld in 2000. 

UCSD was led by fre hman 
Stacy Dunsmore, who had teall1-
highs of IS kills and IS digs. 
Freshman setter Teresa Ohta con-
tributed 35 assisl'S. Ashley 
Peterson and Laura Santerre 
chipped in with 14 and II kills, 
respectively. 

J usr a night earlier, the Tritons 
ea rned a big road win with a 3- 1

Darlene May Gymnasium. 

The Broncos, who fell ro 2-6 in 
the ' CAA and 4- 12 overall , 
jumped to lhe early lead with a 30-

rebOllnded and closed Ollt Cal 
Poly i'nmuna, winning thc tinal

Tritons compete in Stanford Invitational 
Ex-UCSD cross country star James Nielson races against old team 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's and women's 
cross country teams traveled 
north last Saturday to compete in 
the Stanford Invitational in Palo 
Alto. 

Former Triton and UCSD 
Male Athlete of the Year James· 
Nielson also ran in the race as part 
o f Stanford 's team beca use he is 
currently taking advantage of his 
fi nal yea r of eli gibili ty while 
working towa rd a graduate 
degree. 

UCSD cross coun try coach l e d 
\ 'an Arsda le had no reservations 
about seeing his former runner race 

a~amst him. 
~ "I'm eXCited to watch him race 

anytime," Va n Arsdale said. "The 
rt:ality is he was ready to move up. 
T here's no a ben er place fo r him to 
be." 

Competing in a fie ld of about 
~ oo runner and against the likes 
uf UC DaVIS, University of Utah, 

UC Santa Barbara , Cal State 
U niversity Fullerton, UC 
Riverside, Long Beach State and 
Cal State University San Marcos, 
the TrilOns placed 18th out of 21 
entering teams. 

"[The competition] was the best 
we've seen so far this year," Van 
Arsdale said. "With the possible 
exception of the UC Irvine 
Invitational , which didn't have as 
many teams in it." 

T he men's cross country team 
competed with its B group because 
the A team stayed home to train for 
the upcoming conference race. 

"The [A group] ran a 12-miler 
Saturday on a constant descending 
pace, running faster and faster and 
they have to stay with each other," 
Van Arsdale said . "What we've 
been attempting to do is race at a 
maximum velocity and work on 
pack dynamics." 

Van Arsdale was satisfi ed with 
his runners' performances. 

"The group we tOok did a ter-
rifi c job of competing," he sa id. 

"We beat the Division JlI schools 
and two [California C ollegate 
Athletics Association] conference 
rivals." 

Individually, sophomore Devin 
Callister had the top time for 
UCSD, coming in 93rd overall 
with a time of 27 :33 for the 8,000-
meter course. 

"He's just tOugh ," Van Arsdale 
said. "Last year he ran the 10,000-
meter event for track and had the 
fastest freshman time. [Today] he 
ran an outstanding progression -
he started off at a good pace and 
increased his speed. " 

Juni or Ja on StOne, who was 
named T riton racer o f th e week for 
his perfo rmance, was the next 
TritOn to finish. H e timed in at 
28: 15 to come in 114th. Freshman 
Luke Si gmon was just behind 
Stone at 116th with a time of 
28 :18. Sophomore Mike Lord, 
sophomore John M orri son, fresh-
man Mike Daly and sophomore 
Adam Mill er all pl aced within the 
top 130 fin ishers fo r UC D. 

Both Callister and Stone earned 
a spot on the UCSD conference 
team with their performances in 
the invitational. 

Stanford won the team competi-
tion easily and earned a total of 36 
points while the second place team, 
Utah State University, was 17 
points behind with 53. UC Santa 
Barbara, University of Utah and 
UC Davis rounded out the top five 
finishing teams. 

On the other side of the course, 
the Triton women competed in a 
short course of 4,000 meterS and 
were led by senior Mary Peate, who 
ran the course in 15 :02 to finish 
67th overall. 

"Mary's doing a very good job 
this year balancing her tOtal devel -
opment," Van Arsdale said. "She's 
made some dramatic improvements 
both in the classroom and with the 
[earn." 

Freshman Lindsey Young was 
the second Tritun to finish the 
course, coming in 77th with a time 
of 15:21. 

" Lindsey Young is a freshman 
with a mission," Van Arsdale said. 
"She's our No. 2 runner right 
now." 

Sophomore Julie Pope came in 
third for UCSD, finishing the 
course in 15:49 to place 96th over-
all . 

The Tritons came in 17th place 
as a team with 431 points, finish -
ing 391 points behind overall win-
ner Stanford which ended with 40 
points. 

Freshman Stanford runner 
Alicia Craig was the individual win-
ner for the women's course, clock-
ing in with an impressive time of 
12 :40. 

U nfortunately for the Tritons, 
fre shman Cassandra Cooper 
severely sprained her ankle during 
warm-ups for the event and will 
most likely miss the rest of the sea-
son. 

T he T ritons will travel next 
weekend to the Paul Short 
Invitational in Bethlehem, Penn. 

Men's soccer outlasts · UC Davis because

Sports Editor 

T he UCS D men's occer team ca n add a

The UCSD men's water polo 
team won two games last week-
end in the UC Santa Cruz 
SlugFest tournament in Santa 
Cruz to remain undefeated this 
year. 

In their first game against 
the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology the Tritons romped 
to a 22-5 pounding of M.LT

second and third quarters, in 
which they outscored their 
opponents 9-2 and 8-1, respec-
tively . . 

In their second game the 
Tritons were actually given a lit-
de competition by UC Davis, 
but it wasn't enough to disrupt 
UCSD's 7-5 victory over the 
Aggies. 

Allan once again led the 
Tritons with three goals while 
H opkins, Morschall, Ellis and 
freshmen Travis Boettner 

rounded out the scoring for the 
Tritons. 

UC Davis hung tough 
despite being out5Cored 2-1 in 
the first three quarters. The 
Aggies attempted a comeback in 
the fourth quarter when they 
outscored UCSD 2-1 but 
remained three goals short of an 
upset. 

With these two victories the 
Tritons, ranked ninth in the 
nation, improved to a perfect 8-
o for the season. 

I know there are many people out 
there who would love for 
me to ramble on about 
something related to 
UCSD in this column_ To 
you, I apologize. 

With the regular season winding down, 
I feel obligated to give my two cents on the 
happenings in Major League Baseball this 
year. 

Undoubtedly, the biggest story of the 
year involves Barry Bonds' assault on Mark 
McGwire's single-season home run mark of 
70, a record that few believed would ever 
fa ll. Yes , I realize that Ichiro and the 
Mariners are big news, along with Rickey 
Henderson 's chase of Ty Cobb and 3,000 
hits, but not as big as the number 70. 

First off, I have to say that I hate Barry 
Bonds. To me, he is nothing but an ego-dri-
ven jerk who chokes in the clutch. That 
being said, I have to respect what he is 
doi ng this year. He has been amazing in not 
only hitting home runs, but also helping his 
team win. Of his 69 home runs, 30 of them 
have either tied the game or have given his 
team the lead; impressive numbers for a guy 
who is 'lot supposed to deliver in the clutch. 

Still, I would hesitate to call Bonds the 
premier power hitter of' our generation. 
Not to take anything away from him, but 
just look at the stats: Prior to this season, 
Bonds had failed to even pass the SO-homer 
mark not exactly indicative of a great power 
hitter. Personally, I think that the tide 
should go to Sammy Sosa, who is about to 
become the first person in history to hit 60-
plus big flies in three consecutive seasons. 

To take that a step further, I wouldn't 
even call Bonds the best power hitter of a 
single season, even if he does break the 70 
mark. While some people scratch their 
heads at this logic, I simply point to the 
environment that Bonds hits in compared
