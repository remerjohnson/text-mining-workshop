Sweeten asks for hike 
in student org funding 

O.A.S.I.S. faces major new cuts 
Staff worried over formula used for budget 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

In his latest version of the A.S. 
budget, A.S. President Christopher 
Sweeten called for reductions to 
student-initiated outreach and 
the Academic uccess Program in 
order to increase funding to stu-
dent organizations. 

Sweeten proposed a $2,000 cut 
to outreach, from $41,000 this year 
to $39,000 in 2005-06. Originally, 
Sweeten had planned no cuts to 
the line item. 

The money, which is appro-
priated by the Student Initiated 
Outreach Resource Council, pro-
vides support services to disadvan-
taged high school students and also 
works as a retention tool to aid 
sntdents on campus. 

Although outreach and reten-
tion should be a top priority for 
the A.S. Council, Vice President 
External Kevin Mann said, the out-
reach budget cuts were necessary. 

"[A.S. members) all knew that 
we didn't want to reduce SIO, but 
we had to do it," he said. "We're 
getting cut across the board. It's 
hard to weigh on one hand our 
students and on the other hand the 
community of San Diego." 

ASP, which focuses on student 
retention, wi ll also face a reduction 
from a budget of $42,000 this year 
to $40,000 in 2005-06 under the 
plan. Savings from the two reduc-
tions will be distributed to student 
organizations through the $291 ,750 
Student Orgs Unallocated account. 
All student organization and col-

lege council will be able to pull 
funds from that pot for events and 
operations. 

While the cut to his program 
is unfortunate, SP Executive 
Director Terry Le said that provid-
ing more funding to student orga-
nizations i a worthy cause. 

"In my personal view, I feel that 
student orgs hould be given the 
freedom to put on the events they 
want to do," he aid. "There is a 
strong connection between ASP 
and student orgs regarding reten-
tion. In my mind, at least the cuts 
from ASP go to student orgs." 

Mann shared similar sentiments 
and said the $4,000 addition to 
the unallocated line item was an 
important budget move. 

"If SIO had to be cut, then the 
only place I could see that money 
going back to was Student Orgs 
Unallocated," Mann said. "I would 
rather not see SIO get cut, but ] 
think the next priority would be 
to have the money go back to the 
student organizations." 

Despite funding decreases, ASP 
will still be able to conduct normal 
operations such a mentoring pro-
grams, he said. 

However, continued budget cuts 
will hun ASP growth, such as the 
effectiveness of a new office planned 
for the Price Center expan ion to be 
completed in 2008, Le added. 

The proposed budget would 
al 0 eliminate A.S. stipends for 
some member, including all col-
lege senators and the A.S. elections

The Office of Academic 
Support and Institutional ervices 
is facing $90,000 in cuts to its 
permanent budget over the next 
two years, leaving both staff and 
the students who use the facilities 
concerned about the future of the 
office's retention programs. 

"It's come to the question of 
whether we should cut an entire 
program or cut the number of 
students we're able to help," 
O. .S.LS. Director Patrick 
Velazquez said. 

In addition to cuts of $45,000 
annually to its permanent budget, 
funds distributed to the center's 
temporary budget are also at stake, 
depending upon a specific alloca-
tion formula that uses a list of 
approximately 900 sntdents clas-
sified by the university Office of 
Student Affairs as "at risk. " 

To qualify for the list, the for-
mula takes into account an incom-
ing freshman's high school GPA as 
well as SAT I and IT scores, even-
tually projecting a student's first 
year GPA. If a student's predicted 
average falls below a 2.8, the stu-
dent is labeled as "at risk. " 

If the tudent' GPA by the 
end of his or her fir t year is 
below a 2.0, or if the student has 
fewer than 36 units, OAS.LS. 
loses roughly 1,800 per stu-
dent. Conversely, if the student 
maintains a GPA above 3.0 and 
accumulates 36 units, O.A.S.l.S. 
receives an e timated additional 
600. ames of studen ts placed 

Scholarship plan faces new hurdles 
Academic Senate to vote on grants this week 

By SHANNON ELIOT 
Senior Staff Writer 

An athletic scholarship propos-
al developed by Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs]oseph W. Watson 
is facing criticism from faculty, 
staff and other campus administra-
tors. It will go before the campus' 
Academic Senate later this week. 

While the proposal has received 
vocal support from top leaders on 
the A.S. Council, some faculty and 
staff have expressed concerns about 
the plan. The UCSD Council of 
Provosts, although not formally 
opposing the scholarships, has 
expressed reservations about the 
concept and raised question over 
the idea of giving money to athletes 
while many campus programs are 
in need of financial aid. 

"While the provosts under-
stand that there has been a shift in 
NCAA policy regarding Division 
IT regulations, we feel that their 
imperative should not dictate 
UCSD's policy," Earl Warren 
College Provo t Steven Adler

that would provide grants to all Triton athletes. 
stated in an e-mail. "The campus 
currently maintains two equally 
justifiable criteria for scholarships: 
merit and need. Grants-in-aid to 
student athletes meet neither cri-
terion. Our athletes have always 
performed with distinction both 
athletically and academically, and 
we question the value of these 

grants-in-aid in light of the many 
other initiatives that are under-
funded or receive no funding." 

Watson did not respond to 
requests seeking comment.

Grants: Provosts concerned 
about giving aid to athletes 

continued [rom page I 
that the plan would significantly 
enhance the universi ty's abil ity to 
recruit better athletes. 

Money for the scholarships is 
expected to come from savings 
and reserves initially, and then 
from student registration fees . 
T here are no details available at 
the moment as to which student 
programs would be affected by the 
plan, although the proposal states 
that the expenditure commimlent 
will not impact annual allocations 
of permanent and temporary 
funding to the Registration Fee 
Advisory Committee. 

The proposal has also been 
the subject of a series of nego-
tia tions between Watson and the 
Senate Council, the top adminis-
trative committee of me Academic 
Senate, Senate Chair Donald 
Tuzin said. Watson's proposal will 
be submitted to the Representative 
Assembly for deliberation at a May 
24 meeting. 

Adler said the fa cui ty is not 
actively fighting the proposal but 
is making sure to provide feed-
back throughout the process. 

"Our input was solicited as 
part of the process o f coll ab-
orative discourse that the campus 
undertakes for any such initia-
tive," Adler stated . "We are not 
fi ghting this proposal. .. . We wi ll 
see what that debate generate 
in order to determine if a subse-
quent response is warranted." 

The proposal, which would 
provide $500 annually to each 
of the university'S intercollegiate 

athletes, seeks to comply wi th 
an NCAA mandate stating that 
every Division II school must 
make previously optional finan-
cial awards available to its athletes. 
The university, which moved from 
Division ill to Division n in 2000, 
has received a waiver for the 2005-
06 academic year. 

Should the proposal pass and 
UCSD find itself unable to obtain 
a waiver for the 2006-07 aca-
demic year, athletes will be enti-
tled to scholarships in two years. 
According to the new NCAA rule, 
effective in the fall , each institu-
tion must offer a minimum of 
$250,000 for athletic scholarships; 
the UCSD plan provides a maxi-
mum of $300,000. However, the 
scholarships would require chan-
cellor approval, which is based on 
faculty input and support. 

"We have done admirably in 
recruiting excellent student ath-
letes with ut offering financial aid 
based on athletic participation," 
Adler stated. "We recommend 
that UCSD once again request 
an exemption to the Division II 
requi rement, which is currently the 
status under which we operate." 

Athletes would still need to 
meet academic requirements to be 
eligible for the grants. Continuing 
students would need to keep a tnin-
imum cumulative GPA of 2.5 and 
successfully complete 36 uni ts in 
the previous academic year, with 12 
uni ts each quarter, to quali fy.

I BRIEFLY 
Students fear loans 
more than terrorism 

More members of the first class 
of students to complete all four years 
of college since the terrorism attacks 
Qn Sept. 11, 200 1, said they are most 
afraid of going into debt than those 
who named terrorism as their biggest 
fear, according to a new survey com-
missioned by Partnership for Public 
Service. 

While 83 percent of graduat-
ing seniors described themselves as 
·patriotic,· almost a third said they 
were most fearful of encountering 
unsustainable debt, compared to 
just 13 percent who said they were 
afraid of a terrorist attack, even 
though more than two-thirds said 
they expected a major attack within 
the next five years. Being unem-
ployed trailed debt as the second 
most feared option. 

The results of the survey, 
Partnership for Public Service CEO 
and President Max Stier said, showed 
that patriotism alone was not enough 
to sustain public interest in govern-
ment and public service. 

·Our resea rch shows that patri-
otism surrounding 9/11 did not 
give the government a free pass 
in recruiting talent," Stier stated in 
the organization'S press release. 'We 
need a ne'N call to public service, 
one that balances young people's 
patriotism with two factors that are 
just as important to them: pay and 

prestige~ 
WIlen asked when they thought 

the war on terror would end, almost 
30 percent said never and another 27 
percent said "not in my lifetime~ 

In addition, though more than 
two-thirds said that the 9/11 ter-
rorist attack made their view of the 
United States more positive, almost 
86 percent said the war in Iraq did 
the opposite. 

University of Missouri 
to settle lawsuit 

A SI. Louis County Circuit Court 
judge has given a tentative stamp 
of approval to a settlement reached 
between the University of Missouri 
and student plaintiffs in an eight-year-
old class action lawsuit 

The suit charged that the uni-
versity had violated a 1931 state 
law by charging students in-state 
tuition based on credit hours from 
1995 until 2001 , when the law was 
repealed. 

The university has agreed to set 
up a $10 million scholarship that 
would fund qualifying students and 
their spouses and children. 

'The University of Missouri is 

pleased that this matter is close 
to being resolved," the university's 
President Elson S. Floyd stated in a 
press release. 'The settlement will 
benefit students who wish to further 
their education at the University of 
Missouri." 

In addition, the university will need 
to pay the students' attorneys more 
than $1 million. 

Fox to hold online 
chat with students 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox will 

hold an online chat with students, 
allowing them to ask her questions 
and offer their personal feedback 
about Fox's first year at UCSD. 

Scheduled from noon to 1 
p.m. on May 24, students will be 

~ble to access the live Web talk at 
hrrp.//choncelforschotucsd.edu. 

Titled 'What I Learned This Year 
and Other Topics," the chat will focus 
on Fox's experience at the campus 
and issues brought up by students. 

Harvard to spend S50 
million on diversity 
In response to a report issued 

by a new task force on women fac-
ulty in science and engineering fields 
that called for large-scale improve-
ments to the university's recruitment 
policies, Harvard President Lawrence 
H. Summers has announced plans 
to invest $50 million over the next 
decade in efforts to increase the ranks 
of women and minority faculty at the 
campus. 

Earlier this year, Summers 
received widesoread criticism for 
his remarks suggesting that ·intrinsic 
aptitude" differences between gen-
ders could be responsible for low 
numbers of women in science and 
engineering. 

The centerpiece of the newly 
issued recommendations call for 
the appointment of a new senior 
vice provost for diversity and fac-
ulty development to oversee faculty 
appointment processes at the Ivy 
League campus. 

'These recommendations will 
receive our most careful consider-
ation," Summers stated in a press 
release. "Because they address fun-
damental i5sues about the w~ we 
conduct our core academic business, 
they have the power to make Harvard 
not only more welcoming and diverse, 
but a stronger and more excellent uni-
versity overall ~ 

Before spending the money, 
Summers said that the university 
would carry out "feasibility and cost 
analyses" of the proposals.

MONDAY. MAY 23, 2005 THE UCSD G! JAR DIAN 

.Bid: Regents to vote on lab proposal this week 
conrinued from page I 

research institution in the world 
with a seasoned team of contrac-
tors , led by Bechtel, to put in place 
a strong management and opera-
tions team that will ensure the 
continued excellence of the lab-
oratory's scientific mission," UC 
President Robert C. Dynes stated 
in a press release. 

The university has managed the 
lab since 1942 , while also run-
ning the Lawrence Livermore 
Laboratory and the Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory. 
T he U.S. Department of Energy 
owns aJl three labs. Congressional 
legislation passed in 2003 man-
dated that the management and 
operating contracts for the labs 
be put up for competitive bidding. 
The U niversity of California was 
recendy awarded a new contract for 
the Lawrence Berkeley lab. 

The current management 
agreement for the Los Alamos lab 
will expire on Sept. 30, 2005. The 
university approached Bechtel last 
fall about a possi ble partnership, 
according to UC spokesman Chris 
Harrington. 

"We wanted to strengthen our 
managemenr and operations, so 
we went to the best and went to 
Bechtel ," Harrington said. 

If the UC bid is successful, 
current Lawrence Livermore lab 
Director Michael Anastasio will 
become the new director of the 
Los Alamos lab. 

T he university'S operation of 
the Los Alamos lab came under 
scrutiny after a series of safety and 
security violations in recent years. 
According to Bechtel spokesman 
Mike Kidder, the company will be 
able to help the university in man-
agement issues. Bechtel currently 
runs the Nevada Test Site, another 
energy research complex own ed 
by the Department of Energy, and 

was also recently contracted by the 
government to help rebuild Iraq 's 
in frastructure. 

"We certainly have world-class 
industrial and managerial experi -
ence that we could bring to the 
table," Kidder said. 

Almough he declined to com-
ment on rhe governance structure 
of the UC-Bechtel partnership, 
Harrington emphasized that it was 
"a partnership of equals." 

"The university will continue to 
do what it does best, and that's sci-
ence and technology, and the cor-
porate entities will do what they do 
best, and that's business, manage-
ment, safety and security," he said. 

However, despite the new part-
nership, the UC Board of Regents 
will not officiaJly vote on whether 
to malce a competitive management 
bid until it reviews the Energy 
D epartment's final "Request for 
Proposals" at its meeting this 
week. 

"Whi le moving forward to 
strengthen its management team, 
the final decision about whether to 
compete for the new Los Alamos 
contract will be made by the uni-
versity'S Board of Regents," UC 
Regents Chairman Gerald Parsky 
stated in a university announce-
ment. "I know 1 speak for the 
entire board when 1 say that we 
take this decision very seriously and 
will weigh a variety of factors in the 
process, including the best interest 
of the university, the nation, the 
laboratory and our employees." 

If the regents do decide to make 
a competitive bid, the university may 
face some significant competition. 

The University of Texas regents 
recently authorized its chancellor 
to partner with technology and 
defense giant Lockheed Martin in 
a joint bid for the Los Alamos 
lab. The UT regents also voted to 
appropriate $1.2 million to prepare 

the joint proposal. 
"The work of Los Alamos is fun -

damental to our national security," 
UT Board of Regents Chairman 
James R. Huffines stated in a press 
release. "The fact that the Texas 
system is being considered for this 
worlc is a tribute to our faculty and 
the research they produce." 

Defense contractor Northrop 
Grumman is also currently seek-
ing an academic partner for a joint 
management bid. 

The Livermore-based non-
profit Tri-Valley Communities 
Against a Radioactive Environment 
announced in January that it would 
partner with Nuclear Watch of 
New Mexico ro make a bid for the 
Los Alamos lab as well . According 
to Tri-VaUey C.A.R.E.S. Executive 
Director Marylia Kelley, the pur-
pose of the bid would be to influ-
ence other competitors to include 
contract provisions that would 
reduce the amount of nuclear 
weapons research at the lab and to 
ensure the safety of its employees 
and community members. 

"Tri-Valley C.A.R.E.S. isn't sur-
prised that the universityannounced 
a partnership with Bechtel," Kelley 
said. "The University of California's 
track record on basic managerial 
issues has really been quite weak, so 
we expected the university to bring 
in a corporate partner." 

Yet Kelley said she feels that 
bringing Bechtel on board will not 
help to alleviate some of the uni-
versity'S past managerial problems. 

"I think that the [problems) are 
deeply entrenched, and it's going to 
take a new approach," Kelley said. 
"I think that grasping a corporate 
partner that~ already involved in 
the nuclear weapons program is not 
going to solve the problems."

A re you on Facebook? The question is as ubiqui tous these days as the incessantly annoying Nokia ring-
tone. Internet networks, blogging and that 
ever-wonderful tool of nonconfrontation, 
the e-mail, have all become such cultural 
fixtures for our generation that to under-
estimate their impact would be foolhardy; 
indeed, it is probably impossible to fully 
grasp the peculiar nature of young people 
today without taking a serious look at the 
endless hours wasted, lost forever, on such 
online exhibitionism. 

As pervasive as they are, however, one 
defining characteristic of our relations to 
such pastimes is that we are not entirely 
comfortable with them. There is a certain 
amount of shyness, even shame, surround -
ing the internet community issue. People 
often scoff at those who make a habit of 
hanging out on Facebook, and it becomes 
an ego-booster to more or less proclaim 
oneself too busy and too confident to 
condescend to such desperation. Yet more 
and more people join nonetheless, Not 
only are populations on Internet networks 
like Facebook or MySpace expanding like 
a rabbit colony, but bunnies of all sorts get 
in for fun , The days of emo kids dominat-
ing the cyber sphere have come to an end; 
the normal, th e boring and the eccentric 
have pushed them aside. As peer pressure 
expands exponentially to relieve each new 
member of his sense that he lacks a social 
life, we all collectively reduce our social 
lives in an unspoken , mutually shared 
agreement. 

Yet the emo roots of such cultural 
addictions till run strong - unfortu-

nately. The tendency for the distraught, 
confused and disoriented to spill their guts 
out on their lntemet diaries is as consis-
tent as ever. It is appar-

through which UCSD students can anony-
mously mock and ridicule one another. 
That people enjoy the thrill of assert-

ently much too tempting 
to unburden yourself to 
the priest of cyber space 
and endlessly detail, in 
public, your every hate, 
insecurity and mortal 
enemy. That it compli-
cates relationships with 
people who read these 
posts in turn does not 
seem to always matter. 
That it is ethically ques-
tionable to attack people 
online and then deny 
them their human right 
to defend themselves 
and respond on the same 
grounds does not seem to 
bother. The high we get 
from disposing of th at 
negative energy without 
the immediate conse-
quences of releasing it, 
and making it someone 
else's problem as well, is 
just too much - and we 
capitulate. 

The worst of these 
excesses can be seen in 
blogs like YouCSD.com. 
While the site is occa-
sionally entertaining, 

" As ridiculous as 
selfabsarptian [in 
blogging} can be, 
blogs provide a 

unique outlet for 
selfexpression and, 
most importantly, 
selfpublishing, that 

in tum creates a 
tWOrld of culture and 
gives voice to those 
too unconventional 

to be heard in 
mainstream 

her " sp es . 
there is hardly a dearth . 

ing their ability to criticize is 
nothing special, but at least 
other campus avenues for this, 
such as the CII'jfornill Rroiew, 
the New FrrmtitT, or even the 
KoaI4, are done openly and 
therefore with some sem-
blance of honesty and integ-
rity. Something like YouCSD 
brings out the worst in our 
generation, the underlying 
fuel to all the compulsive 
blogging, networking and 
online gossip circulation. 

That fuel is, quite simply, 
self-absorption. Our genera-
tion is remarkably and ridic-
ulously self-absorbed. The 
amount of time we spend wor-
rying, thinking, writing and 
complaining about our exis-
tence and ourselves far exceeds 
anything that our parents' 
generation would recognize. 
In previous generations, many 
young people spent their time 
worrying about where to work, 
when to marry and what career 
to choose. But the age of the 
Twixters means we spend our 
time worrying about much 
more substantial things - like 
how stupid everyone else 
seems, how society is destroy-

of entertaining material on the Web - and 
thus YouCSD seems only to be an avenue 

ing our souls with consumerism (while 
we benefit from this development all the 

same) and how traumatizing our love lives 
are. And posting pictures of ourselves. We 
really like to do this as well. 

This is simply an honest critique of 
the blogosphere from a dedicated blogger. 
Analyzing the' blogosphere is necessary, 
even if not particularly flattering conclu-
sions are reached . Yet the self-absorption 
machine of the Internet actually can be 
used for emotionally and soc.ially produc-
tive ends - it is not just for emo kids or 
supernerds. As ridiculous as self-absorption 
can be, blogs provide a unique outlet for 
self-expression and, most importantly, self-
publishing, that in turn creates a world of 
culture and gives voices to those too uncon-
ventional to be heard in the mainstream 
spheres. Blogging and Internet networks 
allow people to connect without the use 
of stellar social skills or a justifiable excuse 
for asking one's name - it allows us to be 
more honest about ourselves and realize 
collectively our shared humanity. In short, 
we are all lame enough for Facebook. Such 
a fact should be comforting, not depress-
ing, 

As long as twO simple rules are fol -
lowed, Internet networks and blogging can 
be a positive addition to your life. First, 
do not air dirty laundry online. Attacking 
or complaining about others online and 
not to their faces is simply cowardly and 
an unfair attempt to get something for 
nothing. Second, do not treat a blog like a 
psych couch, If you are crying in a comer 
or cutting yourself, you need a therapist 
and a private journal, not a live one. A little

MONQO.Y. MAY n. 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

'Giving credit where credit is due 
Thanks to those who made this year, er, special 
Indecent 
Exposure 
Marianne Madden 

Can you believe I've spent an entire year fai thfully writing columns to make 
you snicker derisively every two 
weeks? I can't ei ther. Frankly, 
it's left me tired. I want a sand-
wich . If I ever had column ideas, 
I'm out - until next fall, when 
I'll be buoyed by a summer's 
worth of alienating, ridicule -
worthy experiences and a much-
needed break from UCSD. 

Thanks to all who e-mailed 
me with feedback about my col-
umns - positive or negative , 
I had fun ignoring all of your 
thoughtful letters . Thanks to 
those who used my columns 
to line a birdcage, or a cat's 
litter box or to wash windows 
- which, I found out this week-
end , ac tually works like a charm , 
And lastly, thanks to those who 
acknowledged my columns (and 
my existence) by awkwardly 
staring at me on the shuttle 
or whil e wandering to class, 
There's noth ing quite like a 
creepy stare to say, "Hey, you 're 
that chick from the Guardian'" 

Now, I was going to keep 
those "Thank yous" to a simple 
three, but come to think of it, 
I have a bunch more people to 
thank. Let's all give a round of 
applause to: 

The undercover San Diego 
cop who ruined my Sun God: 
It must be awesome doing the 
grown-up equivalent of shoot-

ing fish in a barrel. 
Ian, for the boringly civil 

break-up: My bed is big, empty 
and not a boy, but at least it 
doesn't worship Ryan Adams or 
wear ugly shirts . 

Every male cashi er at Trader 
Joe's, who ins ists on flirting 
with me even when I'm tired 
and in a bad mood: I'm sorry if 
I'm curt with you . It's not you, 
it's me. And would you stop 
manhandling that baguette? 
Thanks. 

Grant Schrader and Vlad 
Kogan, for not punching me 
in the face : Hey, I can't help it 
if you two are so damn easy to 
make fun of during long pro-
duction sessions. 

Joe Watson, for being the 
root of evil at UCSD: The cit-
ies of Santa Barbara, Las Vegas, 
Tijuana and Rosarito must wor-
ship you for driving so many 
thrill -seeking UCSD students 
their way. Never in history has 
anyone made seedy Mexican 
clubs or dangerous Mexican 
moonshine look so damn 
appealing. 

Marye Anne Fox, for ele-
vating bad haircuts to entirely 
new heights and for hanging 
on to those su perfluous letters 
in your name: Both must take 
huge courage. I wish I could 
thank you for what you've done 
for UCSD this year, but I have 
no fricki n' idea of what that 
entails, 

The Price Center dancing 
girl, for teaching me those awe-
some dance moves: ] can't keep 
the guys off of me! 

Brother J ed and other crazy 
preacher-types: You 're always 
good for a hearty laugh. And is 
it just me, or does your pseu-

do-religious bullshit make you 
horny for furious, drunle, hyp-
ocritical premarital sex while 
lying, cheating, stealing, getting 
an abortion and being a femi-
nist? OK, I guess it's just me , 

Those Greeks on Library 
Walle, who completely ignore 
me when giving out their rave 
cards to other people: I didn't 
want to go to your party any-
way. 

UCSD students, for being 
so entertainingly nasty to each 
other: It makes a friendly "Hey, 
there" make you think you've 
di ed and gone to Super-Friendly 
H eaven, 

All my friends, for not throw-
ing up on my bed this year: 
A huge improvement from last 
year, guys! Congratulations! 

My self-righteous, nosy, 
flamboyantly religious neigh-
bor: Gosh, what would I do 
without your lectures, which 
come out of nowhere and last 
entirely too long? You're like 
the crazy uber-Christian uncle 
I never had , 

The parking office, for slap-
ping me with a $40 ticket and 
rejecting my appeal: You make 
biking to school so damn appeal-
ing, I can't wait to live close to 
campus next year , 

My roommates - all six of 
them - for not killing me: 
Thanks a bunch. Hey, do you 
know where the TV remote 
went? You don't? OK, what 
about the cat, then? 

That fucker who stole my 
bi ke fr es hman year: I 'm still 
mad at yo u. Hmm, th at wasn' t 
a th ank-you at all. Well , let's 
continue., .

~ I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Fight, don't settle, on 

RIAA lawsuits 
Dear Editor: 

A while back I became aware 
that the Recording Industty 
Association of America was goi ng 
after individual students at UCSD 
for infringing on the copyrights 
of some vety rich music artists. I 
want to encourage those who are 
targeted by the RIAA to not setde 
and instead fight their lawsuits. 
Mark Cuban, (ownerorthe Dallas 
Mavericks and founder of a suc-
cessful online multimedia enter-
prise) makes an excellent point in 
his blog (h ttp://WUIlJ),b/ogmuvtrick, 
cum) that states that instead of 
going about file sharing illegally, 
people can now listen to music 
at a market rate of roughly $5 a 
month, Ths is the selling point of 
Yahoo's new music service. It is 
important to note that the RIAA 
represents the same industry scan-
dalous for its pay-far-play antics. 

By mounting a challenge to 
the RIM's bullish tactics, a con-
sciousness will arise to put the 
power in the voice of the con-

Net: Students 
shouldn't air 
dirty laundry 
on Internet 

continued from page 4 
reflection here and there is nne, 
but depending on blogs for discus-
sion of serious problems is never 
a good idea and only perpetuates 
such unhealthy behavior; it is no 
coincidence if one blogger's cut-
ting stories somehow manage to 
produce similar ones in her girl-
friends' journals within months. 

Whether or not one has a 
blog, almost everyone has felt the 
blogosphere's strange and myste-
rious rug. It is the same tug we feel 
when watching reality television, 
the same tug that made you snoop 
in your sister's diary: Humans 
are fascinated by other humans. 
As long as this honesty and this 
exchange remains healthy and 
ethical in tone, blogs and Internet 
networks can be beautiful things, 
hopefully allowing us to become 
slightly more connected, even as 
we stiltedly and shyly indulge in 
our unspoken interest in every-
thing "us." 

Column: 
Thanks to 

the SunGod 
Party, lemurs 

and coffee 
continued from page 5 

The SunGod Party, for run-
ning the wackiest joke campaign 
UCSD has ever seen : Your cam-
paign was a joke, right? 

Food co-op bagels, for being 
so toasty and delicious, and for 
keeping me alive this whole year 
because I'm too cheap to buy a 
real lunch: Yum. 

Getting the same education, 
yet paying more and more for it 
with each passing year: Inflation 
is awesome. 

Coffee, for existing. 
Lemurs, for being cute. 
Jimmy Eat World, for attract-

ing so many people at WinterFest 
I didn't get into the concert: I 
didn't want to be corrupted by 
your satanic rock music, anyway. 
Hmmph. (Brother Jed would be 
proud of me, I'm sure.) 

Any and all UCSD-themed 
Web sites, LiveJournal commu-
nities and Craigslist: On dull 
study nights, you remind me 
however angst-ridden, lonely or 
passive-aggressive 1 get, I got 
nothin' on the bulk of UCSD 
students. 

Low expectations: There's 
nothing quite like them to keep 
you pleasantly surprised. 

The light at the end of the 
tunnel : If the year wasn't fun, at 
least it's nearly over.

may be most disadvantaged aca-
demically, is also one of the only 
programs r know of with an incen-
tive-based funding formula," SAAC 
Chair Emily Leach said. 

SAAC has been in discussions 
with Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson since 
February, expre sing its apprehen-
sions concerning the budget cuts to 
O.A.S.l.S., as well as the allocation 
formula . The goal of such negotia-

_ tion , Leach said, is for jurisdiction 
of O .A.S.LS. to be placed within 
the Office of Academic Affairs 
instead of its current position in 
the Office of Student Affairs. 

Calls to Watson's office were 
not returned. 

The staff of the retention pro-
gram has also expressed its dissatis-
faction with the formul a, question-
ing the fairness of the manner in 
which O.A.S.r.S . receives its funds. 

"M y personal preference would 
have been a system of stable fund-
ing as well as a formula based more 
on comprehensive efforts - some-
thing a little bit more individual-
ized," Velazquez said. 

A reduction in funding to 
O .A.S.I.S. puts numerous programs 
at stake, including Summer Bridge, 
a service that prepares incoming 
freshmen the summer before their 
first year and worlcs with them 
throughour their college career. 

"Summer Bridge was extremely 
helpful," said Eleanor Roosevelt 
College sophomore Mohan 
!(mungo, who toole part in the 
program last year. "Without it, 1 
don't thinlc I would have felt as 
compelled to pursue the leadership 
positions I now have, or to be as 
connected with the communities 
that I am in now."

manager. Last year, A.S. Elections 
Manager Steve Yorle received a 
weekly 520 stipend for 10 weeks. 

"1 thinlc that for my year, I viewed 
the 520 a weele as symbolic for several 
dozen hours wonh of worle a weelc," 
Yorle said. "It's ridiculous to continue 
to have these positions where you 
cut the stipends completely and load 
the worle on them." 

Yorlc, who was the only person 
to apply for the position this year, 
said he would support cutting all 
stipends for the salce of uniformity. 

"Personally, I would still talee 
the job without the stipend," he 
said. "What the hell is $200 going 
to do in the end anyway? But when 
you've cut so many stipends out, it 
should be across the board for exec-
utives, too. I think it's funny that 
everyone scoffed at the SunGod 
Party's suggestion to cut stipends 
entirely, but now it's become a real-
ity for many positions." 

Under the plan, AS. executive 
officers are taking stipend cuts, 
including a 7 -percent reduction for 
AS. president and S-percent cuts for 
vice president internal, vice president 
extema.I, vice president of academic 
affairs and vice rresident finance. 

The counci is expected to vote

SAN DIEGO 
Science and Technology Council 

May 2005 

For more than 50 years, the United States has maintained its global economic edge by 
being better than any other country at discovering new knowledge, inventing new 
technologies and exploiting their commercial value. Today, according to surveys done 
by organizations such as the National Intelligence Council, American dominance is 
slipping as Asian countries increase their investments in R&D and challenge our role 
as innovation leader. Among the countries competing with the U.S, in science and 
technology, perhaps no other is as challenging as China. 

To join us in addressing the impact of the globalization of R&D on the American 
innovation system, we are pleased to invite you to a presentation on Wednesday, June 
1, 200S by Dr. Pete Suttmeier, Professor of Political Science, University of Oregon, 
on "China's Research and Innovation Strategies for the 21st Century." The presentation 
will begin at 5:00pm in the International Relations and Pacific Studies Robinson 
Auditorium at UCSD. 

Dr. Suttmeier is a member of the U.S. Department of Commerce Civil Industrial 
Technology Coordinating Committee for relations with the Chinese Ministry of Science 
and Technology. He has served as Senior Analyst at the Congressional Office of 
Technology Assessment, a consultant to the World Bank, and as Director of the Beijing 
Office of the Committee for Scholarly Commu nication with China. 

Sincerely yours, 

Edward Furtek 
Executive Director

W hen California voters approved the sale of $3 billion in bonds to pay for embryonic stem cell 
research, their votes offered few indica-
tions of what type of research citizens 
were willing to accept and how far sci-
entists cou ld go to procure stem cells. In 
fact, the state's Proposition 71 remained 
silent on ethical questions about whether 
doctors could pay women to purchase 
their eggs - as most fertility clinics 
do - or transfer animal stem cells into 
human fetuses, and vice versa. 

On the federal level, few government 
agencies have stepped in to develop stan-
dardized guidelines for researchers after 
President George W. Bush restricted 
federal funding for new embryonic tern 
cell lines, leaving what the National 
Academy of Sciences has called "a patch-
work of regulations" that varies state by 
state and throughout a community of 
very confused scientists. 

After receiving requests from scien-
tists across the nation, the NAS came out 
last month with a set of its own volun-
tary guidelines, hoping to find the right 
mix of scientific independence and soci3l 
ethics. The NAS report was unusual in 
that the impetus came from the scientific 
conununity instead of the government, 
which usually commissions similar stud-
ies. In fact, as a congressionally chartered 
body, the academy is designed to serve as 
the federal government's chief scientific 
adviser. 

"Because federal funding for embry-
onic stem cell research has been very 
Limited, the federal government hasn't 
established many guidelines in this 
sphere," said University of Virginia bio-
medical ethics professor Jonathan D. 
Moreno, who co-chaired the committee 
that wrote the guidelines. "The feed-
back [on our recommendations) has been 
almo t uniformly very positive." 

The new guidelines suggest prohib-
iting doctors from paying donors who 
offer stem cell for research and would 
require researchers to collect consent 
from couples whose embryonic stem cells 
would be used in studies. In addition , 
the recommendations urge a prohibi-
tion against using cells from embryos 
grown in cultures that are older than 14 
days - when the central nervous system 
begins to form - and back a ban on 
the transplantation of animal cells into 
human fetuses, creating mixed organisms 
called "chimeras." 

Perhaps most importantly, the 
guidelines call for the creation of 
new Embryonic Stem Cell Research 
Oversight committees, made up of sci-
entists, ethicists and members of the 
public, to review new research proposals 
at each institution and company engaged 
in studies involving stem cells. 

Members of the scientific community 
have largely prai ed the new guidelines. 

"They're excellent and I hope that 
many American institutions will move to 
implement them," said UCSD cellular 
and molecular medicine professor Larry 

Greg Dale/Guardian 
Making their own guidelines: Researchers take initiative with stem cell research in the Fu Lab at UCSD 
School of Medicine, where Professor lallY Goldstein helped draft Proposition 71 . 

Goldstein, who was one of the authors of 
Proposition 71. "They allow the research 
to move forward and to do so in an ethi-
cal manner." 

In addition, the new guidelines have 
won accolades from California Institute 
for ,Regenerative Medicine's interim 
President 23ch Hall and the insti-
tute's Independent Citizens' Oversight 
Committee Chair Robert Clein, whose 
joint statement ca lled the reconunenda-
tion "an important step in forging a 
much-needed national consensus that 
will guide institutions, scientists and 
funding agencies in this new field of 
research." 

T he institute will be responsible for 
spending the state's $3 billion embryonic 
stem cell research budget, and its gov-
erning committee will likely adopt the 
NAS guidelines as the institute's interim 
ethical standards at a meeting later this 
week. 

. However, the report has been called 
inadequate by the Oakland-based Center 
for Genetics and Society, which also 
backs embryonic stem cell research. The 
center criticized the guidelines for stop-
ping short of supporting the creation of 
a federal agency to license and oversee 
all research involving human embryos 
and cells derived from them, similar to 
governmental bodies found in Canada 
and Britain. 

"This is certainly a shortcoming of 
what NAS could do, and it was disap-
pointing to see them back off the kind 
of regulatory structure that is in place in 
the United Kingdom and Canada," CGS 
Associate Director Marcy Darnovsky 
said. 

The center also faulted the guide-
lines for falling short in protecting the 
women who provide eggs for research 
by failing ro require tha t independent 
doctors - those not connected with the 
research projects - be on hand to care 
for donors. 

Overall, Darnovsk,), said a merely 
voluntary approach was not enough (.o 
properly regulate a field that faces $3 
billion in incentives for new research . 1n 
addition, she worried that the ESCRO 
committees envi ioned by AS would 
be too cozy with the doctors they would 
supposedly be overseeing. 

"One concern is that they're too close 
ro the people. The gardeners are too 
close to the chicken coop," Darnovsky 
said. "There is not sufficient distance 
that would give people assurances and 
give these people on the ESCRO COIll-
mittee the roOIll to consider what is 
being proposed." 

Darno\'sky's fears may not be implau-
sible. 

Federal regulations aLready require 
local institutional review boards ro 
approve all research that

community as a great success in self-gov-
ernance through nonbinding guidelines. 

However, a report released last 
October by the Sunshine Project, an 
activist organization opposing biological 
weapons, has questioned the effective-
ness and transparency of local meso In 
a survey of minutes kept by the com-
mittees, the organization concluded that 
rBCs were largely dominated by the bio-
technology industry they were supposed 
to be regulating. 

For exam ple, at Univer ity of Hawaii 
- which operates labs that work with 
potential biological-weapons agents -
the group found sparse minutes limited 
largely to back-slapping notes record-
ing how much the university and bio-
tech company Monsanto really enjoyed 
working with each other. The min-
utes showed no evidence that the IBC 
reviewed any research or lab safety con-
ditions. 

But other than a few outrageous 
examples, Sunshine Project's report 
stopped short of actually recording a 
trend - because more than 75 per-
cent of the surveyed biotech companies 
failed to tum over minutes from their 
committees, despite federal law requir-
ing them to do so. The government's 
own labs did only slightly better, with 
four of 10 turning over comprehensive 
minutes. 

Like several examples cited by the 
Sunshine Project, Damovsky said she 
feared that ESCRO committees would 
be reluctant to block colleagues' attempts 
to secure funding for their projects. 

"It just male.es it very hard for re9ple 
on committees like that to buck requests 
from colleagues and puts them in an 
untenable position," she said. 

However, Darnovsky admitted that 
the alternative - a government agency 
to oversee the research - posed prob-
lem of its own, opening up the door for 
politics to influence science. 

"I thinle. that's something that really 
has to be taken into account, and [an 
agency) has to be set up with real isola-
tion from government interferences," 
she said. "It is tricky, and I'm sure it's 
why there is so much reluctance about 
setting up centralized regulation." 

On an issue with such high poLitical 
stakes as stem cell research, which echoes 
many moral arguments central to the 
debate over abortion, there is little doubt 
that any new government effort would 
face stiff partisan pressures. Already the 
response to the NAS recommendations is 
split largely among partisan lines. 

For example, Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.), a supporter of embryonic stem 
cell research, issued a statement backing 
the guidelines, concluding that lawmak-
ers "should be aU tha t we can to

Sri Lanka volunteer returns 
from four months abroad 
By KAlE MdLHINNEY 

Staff Writer 
When UCSD alumna Alissa 

Sears hea.rd of the Dec. 26 tsunami 
disaster, she reacted inunediately. 
ill January, she Hew to Sri Lanka to 
volunteer for four months, during 
which time she assisted more than 
30,000 people. 

Full of energy and compassion 
for others, Sears focused on apply-
ing the teaching skills she learned 
at UCSD and the Missouri-based 
Applied Scholastic Institute 
Training Center to educate the vic-
tims and provide emotional support. 

Sears cOlmts this as her fifth trip 
to Sri Lanka - only, this time, she 
arrived in the midst of tsunami dev-
astation and post-civil war tensions. 
She traveled with the Scientology 
Volunteer Organization as a volun-
teer minister and was accompanied 
by 80 volunteers from all over the 
world, including her sister, 2O-year-

old Sam Sears. 
"Alissa is always inspirational, 

super-enthusiastic, open-hearted 
and has a planetwide view point," 
said Veronica Albano, public 
relations director of the Church 
of Scientology in downtown San 
Diego. 

\Vhen interviewed by the 
Guordion, Sears had much to say 
about her experience with the tsu-
nami relief effort. 

GuIlrdum: How did YOll first 
hear about the tsunami disaster on 
Dec.26? 

Sears: I heard about the tsu-
nami on the radio and the internet 
at first. 

G: What was your initial reaction 
when you saw the tsunami victims 
for the first time on TV? 

S: It was honestly one of the 
hardest things to watch. I care so

research try to put a good face on 
an unethical line of research," he 
stated in a press release. "They 
attempt [Q frame the issue as 'how 
to conduct ethical research,' but 
the guidelines entir ely miss the 
point: W e should not be destroying 
young human lives for the benefit 
of others." 

These guidelines are not the 
first time the stem cell debate has 
taken on a larger moral question. 
When Bush appointed UC San 
Francisco cell biologist Elizabeth 
Blackburn to his newly formed blue-
ribbon President's Commission on 
Bioethics in 2002, he called her a 
"dis tinguished" researcher. However, 
Blackburn 's appointment was not 
renewed in 2004, largely because of 
her outspoken support for stem cell 
research, which the president had 
already decided was unethical fo r the 
government to fund. 

Blackburn was trumpeted as a 
martyr by the left- leaning Union of 
Concerned Scientists, who pointed 
to her termination as evidence of 
the poli ticization of science by the 
Bush administration. Sen. John 
Kerry (D-Mass.> repeated the accu-
sation in his 2004 campaign to 
replace Bush. 

The NAS report acknowledged 
that regulation of embryonic stem 
cell research has to walk the pre-
carious line between science and 
ethics. . 

"Scientific inquiry should 
not proceed unfettered, with-
out consideration for the ethical 
and public-policy imperatives of 
the society in which it operates," 
stated Moreno and committee co-
chair, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology cancer-research pro-
fessor Richard O . Hynes, in the 

preface to the recommendations. 
"Ethical concerns need to be bal-
anced against the duty to provide 
the best medical care possible, 
enhancing the quali ty of life and 
alleviating suffering fo r many peo-
ple. The challenge to our society is 
to achieve that balance." 

Goldstein said he and his col-
leagues did not oppose rules to 
guide their research, as long as they 
were done right. 

"Scientists are willi ng to be reg-
ulated, as long as we get to have 
input in the regul atory system," 
he said. "I th ink all of us who are 
going to do this re earch want a set 
of agreed-upon standards so that 
we don't step across the line." 

T he main question, it seems, 
is whether those standards should 
come from the scientists them-
selves or be imposed by the gov-
ernment. The AS report backed 
the fo rmer, though Moreno said 
this was beca use the academy does 
not have the authority to impose 
mandatory rules. 

In 2003, when a different NAS 
committee urged increased regu-
lation of research that could be 
used by internati onal terro rists, 
UCSD School of M edicine D eputy 
Dean David N . Bailey offered his 
own suggestion: T he answer may 
be somewhere in between, with 
society accepting self-regulation as 
long as it is effective and calling on 
government action when voluntary 
guidelines fail. 

"If you do not have any seg-
ment of society regulating itself, 
you have regulations imposed on 
it," Bailey said at the time. "I think 
that's what's happening here. If sci-
ence is irresponsible, then I think 
society will jump in and start man-
dating and regulating control."

Vol.unteer: Helping tsunami 
survivors, not victims 

continued from page 9 
much for these people; it wasn't 
easy. But when you ger there, the-
have so much hope. Here, all I saw 
was the news. But it's so different 
when you go there because you see 
them rebuilding their lives. When 
you help them, that's what makes a 
difference. 

G: "''here in Sri Lanka did you 
volunteer' 

s: I went all over Sri Lanka: 
J assna, Trincomalee, Kuchaaveli, 
Ampara, Hambantota, Matara, 
Chilau, Galle and there was a base 
at Colombo. 

G: How do you fund your trips 
to Sri Lanka' 

S: I have raised S80,000 to 
$90,000 over the years for various 
projects. I JUSt try to raise awareness. 
If I don't have the funds to go, I raise 
awareness here by doing photogra-
phy exhibits, teaching at elementary 
schools and giving talks. I work with 
local school kids and have them write 
letters to kids in Sri Lanka. If I show 
one person and it makes a difference 
in their lives, that's important. 

G: In what ways did you and 
your team help the victims of the 
tsunami' 

S: We were helping to make 
people more able and treat dlem as 
survivors, nor victims. We also had 
Buddhist monks worki ng alongside 
us as volunteers. In some camps, 
there's noth ing. T he victims are 
being given money but need to be 
trained so they can rebuild their 
own communities. We worked with 
enti re refugee camps and provided 
first aid, schooling and emotional 
support. O ur methods arc very use-
ful. 

We met the Secretary General 
of the U. . and he said he couldn 't 
wait for us to rerum. They kept say-

~tL"UCSD 
-see:: EXTENSION 

ing we were the best people they've 
ever known. 

G: What was your most reward-
ing experience' 

S: I have to pick just one? Probably 
the teacher-training workshop. We 
taught Sri Lankans how to be teach-
ers, and for the first time they felt 
like they could help their students. 
1ney lived through the war and 
now this [tsunami). They told me 
no one comes to help them. But we 
learn from them as they learn from 
us. T hey don't complain, they're so 
happy just to have you there. 

G: What organization did you 
go wi th? 

S: I went with VI.S.l.O.N .S [a 
program initiated by Harvard gradu-
ate Meera Pathmarajah of Tamil 
Youths of Human Rights] , when I 
was a junior at UCSD. Ths trip, 
I had originally planned to set up 
a teaching station over there. Bur 
when the tsunami hit, my plans 
changed. Myself and 80 other vol-
unteers went with the Scientology 
Volunteer Organizations and used 
our practical scientology solutions to 
impact people from all different reli-
gions. I t was incredible to get trai ned 
and see the change. It changes you. 

G: How did your family and close 
friends feel about you being in Sri 
Lanka for four months' 

S: My sister Sara went with me 
on this last trip and it was incredible 
to see the impact it had on her and 
how it made her grow. T he rest of 
my fami ly is very supportive. 

G: What motivates you to keep 
returni ng' 

S: When you see each child or 
person rea li ze dley can do some-
dung. When you realize you can do 
something for someone else. To see 
realization is what motivates me to 
keep going.

Baseball: Seniors set the 
standard for other Tritons 
continued from page I 6 

jtmior year and became the ace of 
the UCSD pitching suff during his 
senior season. In 2005, Boutilier 
was selected to the A11-CCAA First 
Team and posted an astounding 
11-2 record with an ERAof3.47. 

"Logan represents what UCSD 
baseball is aU about," O'Brien said. 
"His outstanding year was a result 
of a superior attitude and a superior 
state of mind.» 

Also on the pi tching staff, Triton 
closer Lipetz led the Tritons with 
seven saves on the season. 

"Shlomo [Lipetz) was there for 
us in tough situations and got us 
out of a lot of jams," O'Brien said. 
"He will be missed as a player and 
as a leader." 

Not only will UCSD need to fill 
two crucial pitching positions, but 
O'Brien and his staff must refill the 
infield, as first baseman Robinson, 
second baseman Pinocchio, third 
baseman Gascon and Hernandez 
leave the team. 

Robinson 

" 

son that this team was a national 
contender. " 

TealTUllates before they were 
Tritons, Hernandez and Boutilier 
said they will both sorely miss their 
teammates and the experience of 
playing baseball at UCSD. 

"It's the time in the team room, 
after practice, before games, on the 
bus - times when it's just the team 
and me th a t I'll mi ss the most,» 
Boutilier said. "The friendships 
and seeing people everyday will 
be missing in my heart. There's 
something about sports and col-
lege sports specifically that gets 
to the heart. I'll miss the group 
of guys fighting together daily for 
a common purpose that brings us 
together like nothing else can; it's 
the stuff movies are made of." 

Hernandez agreed with 
Boutilier 's words. 

"I will miss just being out there 
everyday going through the normal 
routines of practice," he said. "I've 

stepped up and 
hit .283 for the 
Tritons in 2005. 
He . smacked 12 
doubles and five 
home runs and 
posted a .478 
slugging percent-
age.

He hit .299 this 
season with 15 
doubles and

baseball head coach 

As always, 
the closing 
of one season 

a .441 sluggi ng percentage. The 
second baseman also swiped eight 
bags, had 124 putouts and collected 
61 hits this year. 

Leading the 2005 Tritons with a 
.3 74 average, Gascon delivered the 
game-winning single in the final 
game against Chico State to give 
UCSD the CCAA Championship. 
For his efforts, Gascon was select-
ed to the All-CCAA Second Team. 
He spent much of the conference 
season among the leaders in hitting 
and has been an all-around athlete 
at third with great defense and 15 
stolen bases. 

O'Brien will miss utility player 
Clark, who hit .3 3 7 with a .408 
on-base percentage. The senior is 
fourth on the team with 64 hits in 
2005 and was named to the A11-
CCAA Honorable Mention team. 

Outfielders Langone, Beltz and 
King, and catcher Matt Anderson 
will also be leaving big holes in 
the field. 

"I'm so proud of the leader-
ship skills that this senior class 
developed throughout this year," 
O 'Brien said. "They are the rea-

begins the 
next, and the future of the UCSD 
baseball program is extremely 
bright. 

"The teams in the next few years 
will have their sights set on not only 
winning the CCAA Championship 
but the Regionals and eventually 
[the NCAA ationals inl Alabama," 
Hernandez. said . "With the coaches 
and players that come up in this 
program, I have a good feeling that 
it won't be long until UCSD has a 
national title for baseball ." 

The 2005 Tritons captured 
the CCAA Championship in what 
O'Brien called a "gutsy perfor-
mance by our ball club." Yet, 
even with the victory, the te3m 
was denied a bid to the NCAA 
Regional Tournament. 

"We made something special 
out of this season, and for the 
seniors, something special worthy 
of going out with a bang," Boutilier 
said. "No one can take that &0111 
us. While the binerness [of not 
getting a Regional bid) may still be 
here, everyone should know that 
whoever wins the 'championship' 
this year didn 't face us."

s,.k pilip: Seniols Nex Gascon (15), Keith Hernandez (27) and Ricky Pinnochio 
(6) were an integral part of UCSO's successful 2005 season.

Baseball to lose 11 players to graduation 
Seniors were key in winning league Championship 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team is 
the 2005 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Champion, 
and the feeling of victory will not 
oon be forgotten, especially for 

the I I graduating seniors, Keith 
Hernandez, Logan Boutilier, 
hlomo Lipetz, Brian Robinson, 

Ricky Pinocchio, Alex Gascon, Joel 
Clark, Ryan Langone, Brad Bel,!;, 

raig King.and Matt Anderson. 
"Without question, the most 

memorable moment for me in my 
four years playing here at CSD 
wa May 14, 2005, when we won 
the .CAA Championship up in 
Chico," Triton senior shortstop 
Ilernandez said. "After four brruel-
ing game in two days, to he able 
to run out on the field and dog-
pile with my teammates was the 
most incredible feeling ever. All 
yea r we talked about how good it 
was going to feel in the end after aU 
the hard work we put in day in and 
day out, and [the championship] 
definitely was everything r expected 
and more." 

UC 0 senior ace pitcher 
Boutilier agreed. 

"Without a doubt, the dogpile 
when we won the conference cham-
pionship in Chico - beating Chico 
on their home field - was the best 
feeling," he said. "We've worked so 
hard and come so far as a team, it 
wa outstanding to let it all go and 
celebrate omething great." 

San Diego natives Hernandez 
and BoutiLier spea rheaded the 
effort for the championship and 

the Triton success over the past 
four years. 

Hernandez, a four-year starter at 
shortstop, has been extremely suc-
cessful under the tutelage ofUCSD 
head coach Dan O'Brien. 

"It has tr uly been a privilege 
to play for coach Dan O 'Brien and 
the UCSD baseball program for 
four years," Hernandez said. "This 
year was truly a special year and I 
will never forget this year's team 
or the final night of our season up 
in Chico." 

Herdandez is the only Triton 

to start in every game since he 
was a freshman - 223 consecutive 
starts. As a freshman, he eamed 
the team's Rookie of the Year and 
Defensive Player of the Year hon-
ors. As a sophomore, he earned 
an All-CCAA Honorable Mention. 
As a junior, he earned All-CCAA 
Second Team honors and set a 
school record of 85 hits. In his 
senior season, Hernandez hit .307, 
smacked the fi.rst two home runs of 
his collegiate career, had 40 RBIs 
and was selected to the All-CCAA 
Honorable Mention squad. 

"Keith will always be remem-
bered as the shortstop that brought 
UCSD baseball to the national 
level," O'Brien said. "He's that 
good." 

With graduation approaching, 
Hernandez awaits the June 6 MLB 
draft and is considering playing 
baseball in Europe. 

Boutilier has developed over his 
four years in the program as well. 
He began as a closer, stepped in 
as a reliever for the majority of his

Women's lacrosse finishes season ranked No. 13 
Tritons beat No.5 Bruins in WWLL consolation match 

By MICHAEL NEUmDTER 
Staff Writer 

Anyone who witnessed the 
UCS D women's lacrosse team's 
final game would have thought the 
Tritons had won a championship, 
but the players were cheering for 
another reason: They had pulled 
off one of the bigge t women' 
lacrosse upsets in the country, 
beating UCL in the Western 
'Vomen 's Lacrosse League playoff 
con olation match in Davis, Calif., 
on pril24. 

The Tritons had a feeling that 
they were going to have a memo-
rable season at the beginning of the 
yea r in January when they played 
Arizona State in Tempe, Ariz. The 
team had struggled against the Sun 
Devi ls during recent seasons and 
placed second to them in confer-
ence last year. 

"As a freshman playing my first 
season at UCSD, I did not know 
too much about our rivalry with 
Arizona State, but I heard many 
time how we usually lose to them 
pretty bad," freshman Rebecca 
Cathcart said. 

Before the team was given a 
chance against the Sun Devils, 
though , they first had to visit the 
Univer ity of Arizona in Tucson, 
Ariz. The team showed no sign of 
trouble and the ritons fini hed 
the game with a 14-5 victory. 

"Vith its first-game anxieties 
out of the way, the Tritons made 
the short trip to Tempe for their 
main challenge. Both teams stayed 
even throughout the duration of 
the game, and they entered the 
final minute tied with even points 

apiece. With \\ seconds remaining 
in the game, junior Deborah Han 
took a pass from sophomore Elisha 

gee and squeaked the ball past 
the Sun Devil goalkeeper to give 
the Tritons the victory. 

"The back-to-back wins were 
exactly what we wanted," opho-
more captain icole Martin said. 
" It was what we needed to get the 
season started on a posi tive note." 

Martin looked at the double 
win to inspire her team in later 
games. 

"Last season , we fell to [Arizona 
tate] quite easily," Martin aid. 

"We knew that if we could beat 
them, it would be a huge confi-
dence boost for the next half of the 
season. " 

Senior captajn Lynn Chouw 
prai ed the women for their team-
work in the important victory. 

"The team played awesome," 
Chouw said. "We worked really 
great together as a team." 

The duration of the Tritons' 
season was just as positive. The 
team fini hed league play with 
a 5-\ recotd and tied for first 
in the WWLL South standings 
with Arizona State. The team had 
many outstanding individual per-
formances throughout the season, 
including senior Leah Weinstein's 
more than 30 goals for the year. 

Chouw also showed she had 
what it took to be a great goalkeep-
er. Chouw converted from defeo e 
to goaLkeeping at the beginning 
of the season and left no doubt 
that she could make the transition 
well. 

"Lynn [Chouwj really did a 
great job for us in goal this sea-

on," Cathcart said. "The season 
would not have been the same 
without her." 

Agee and senior Daphne Bilge 
and Jen Low were the main con-
tributors on offense and effectively 
led the Tritons' forward attack all 
sea on. enior Amanda Overton 
and Martin also hined on defense 
throughout league play. 

Head coach Karen Lawrence 
led the Triton, and many players 
attribute the team's success to her 
leadership. 

"Karen did a great job instruct-
ing us all season long," Cathcart 
said. "She made sure that we 
reached every bit of our poten-
tiaL" 

Chouw echoed Cathcart's sen-
timents. 

"Coach Lawrence was one of 
the main factors in our turnaround 
from last season," Chouw said. 

After completing a successful 
season in league play, the team 
turned toward its next goal of 
qualifying for the national cham-
pionship. In order to qualify, the 
Tritons had to finish very well 
in the WWLL league playoffs in 
Davis, Calif., from April 23 to 
April 24. 

However, their hopes of win-
ning the playoffs dwindled with an 
opening-round loss to Santa Clara 
University. The Broncos finished 
their regular season undefeated 
and were the champions of the 
WWLL North Division. The loss 
ent the Tritons into the conso-

lation bracket, where they faced 
Chico State. The Tritons beat the 
Wildcats and were then awarded 
a matchup against lacrosse pow-

erhouse UCLA in the consolation 
final. 

The Tritons did not allow the 
fact that UCLA was ranked fifth 
in the nation to intimidate them 
into believing there was no chance 
at victory. It was very similar to 
the match against Arizona tate 
at the beginning of the season in 
that it was close throughout the 
entire game, but UCSD came out 
00 top, 8-7, as the final seconds 
ticked away. 

"We were so incredibly excit-
ed," Cathcart said. "It was the last 
game of the sea on no matter what, 
and we wanted to go out with a 
bang." 

The team got national attention 
for its upset victory over the Bruins 
as the win was ranked as the second 
biggest upset in the country. The 
Tritons' victory was ranked only 
behind the University of Rhode 
Island's upset over Arizona State. 

"During the four years that 1 
have played at UCSD, we had 
never beaten UCLA, so beating 
them was very satisfying," Chouw 
said. 

UCSD finished its season 
ranked 13th in the U.S. Women's 
Lacrosse Association rankings. 

"The team has a very bright 
future even though we have seven 
players graduating," Chouw said. 
"I am sure the three rookies will 
step it up and continue the team's 
recent success." 

Chouw will graduate this 
spring without a national trophy. 
However, she will always remem-
ber ending her UCSD lacrosse 
career, along with six other senior 
players, feeling like a champion.

Larsen left 
• • unpresslon 
on UCSD 

By RAIL ENTEEN 
Staff Writer 

Five years after his arrival at 
UCSD brought the Tritons to a 
national championship, men's vol-
leyball head coach Ron Larsen has 
decided to resign in order to take 
a position as an assistant coach to 
the USA Men's Volleyball Olympic 
Team. 

Larsen, who announced his res-
ignation on April 14, was the men's 
volleyball coach from 2000 to 2005, 
and aided the UCSD volleyball 
program in its move from Division 
ill to Division II in hi first year 
as coach. 

He began at UCSD during the 
team's last year in Division III, 
and led the Tritons to the national 
championship. After winning it all, 
Larsen became the first coach to 
lead the Tritons over nationally 
ranked powers such a Penn State, 
UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara. 
This season, in whieh the Tritons 
went 2-24-0, Larsen led the team to 
wins over the University of Southern 
California and Cal Baptist. 

Although this season' record 
was not the team's best, Larsen 
worked hard to increase the qual-
ity of the volleyball program at 
UCSD. 

Before beginning at UCSD, 
Larsen spent seven years at the 
University of Rutgers-Newark, 
where he went 97-80 with the men 
and 117-79 with the women. His 
team was consistently ranked among 
the top 15 teams in the nation, and 
he was named New Jersey Athletic 
Conference Coach of the Year in 
1996 and 1998. In 1998, he was 
also named Eastern Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association Coach of the 
Year. 

From 1989 to 1993 , Lar en 
worked at UC Davis, both as an 
assistant coach for the women's 
team for four years and as head 
coach of the men's team from 1991 
to 1993. At Davis, Larsen led hjs 
team to a 65-31 record, enough for 
a fifth-place finish at the 1993 club 
volleyball tournament. 

Larsen began his coaching years 
at UC Berkeley, where the Bears 
went 102-29 at the club level. He 
also worked at St. Mary's College 
from 1987 to 1988 as assi tant 
coach for their women's team. 

Now Larsen will coach the USA 
Men 's Olympic Team, 10 years 
after winning a silver medal in the 
1995 USA Olympic Festival as head 
coach of the North Men's team. He 
also headed the 1996 USA Boys' 
Youth National Team, made up of 
the top-18 high school players in 
the nation. 

Larsen's past coaching experi-
ence showed in hjs tenure at UCSD, 
and now he will progress to a new 
level when he coaches the Olympic 
team. However, hjs years at UCSD 
were important to the program and 
he will be remembered for his help 
to Triton volleyball.
