Physicians warn of fraudulent cancer treatments 
By ARTHUR SAlAZAR. SlujJ Wi'll",. 

A giu up 01 lOp authontlcs on 
medical lrauu were pan 01 a 
vl de otapeu semin.lr en[l[ led , 
"Cam:er Quackery: Co nsumer 
Beware," at the UCSD School 01 
Medicine on May 2. 

The liSl of speakers w.ts he<lded 
by ViclOr Herbert from the Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine in New 
York. whose investig<llions into the 
medical proression have taken him ' 
around the world. Herbert , both a 
doctor and an attorney, asked his 
audience to recog ni ze how 
"phoney it has to be" when a 
company claims that they have 
dIscovered a preViously unknown 
eliXir because no new products are 
never introduced into this country 
without Intense scrutin ization. He 
sLltcd, "The only forms of cance r 
treatmcnt there arf are. ' it works: 'i t 
docsn't work: and experimental 
the rapy. The Sdd fact of the matter 
IS that ror many. they cannot WJit 
for safe and prove n solutions. they 
must Opt for radical dnd potentially 
deadly drugs." 

There are IrgitilTLlte centers for 
new cancer trcatments. Herbelt 

Mexican tre a tm ent is their 
prescription 01 such upplements. 

The slides were 01 severa l dimcs 
which claimed to ,It least alleviatc 
all degenemtive diseases incluuing 
cance rs (,Ill 300 va rieties were 
trealed the samc way) , hean 
disease and AIDS. 

-These cliniCS have generally 
pleasant surroundings wh ere 
people lis/en to you. something 
which American doctors forget to 
do:' Lowell said . One or their lu res 
to attrdct patients is to tell them 
how gory the American methods 
arc. One ad saId that U.s. hospIta ls 
use "cut surgery. burn radimion 
and poison drugs." 

For their pan, Mexican doctors 
usually found no tumors and 
thercfore did not remove any 
tissue . Instead, they conducted 
painless blood and urine tests, hdi r 
analysis. diagnosis of the eye's iris. 
In ad diti on, they prescribed 
cleanSing by fasting, vegetanan 
diets, enemas, an average of 100-
125 vitamins a day. and , as an 
option, holisti c and religi OUS

Part one 
The plight of the forgotten people 
By BtUCK MOOMCHI 

The phght of the homeless I n the 
United States is a dlsgra e and in 
disasterous proportion. And if the 
maxim, 'by their fruits you shall 
know them' has any credence at all, 
then, In the case of the homeless, 
th is nation has fa iled dismally, 

Two to three mill ion people In 
this count ry have no place to call 
home, so rhey sleep In doorways, 
underpasses, caves, dumpsters, 
cars, rent s, emergen y shelters, etc. 
Mosr of these people are inv lslbk, 
and a subsrant ial proportion 
destitute It I not urprlsing to fi nd 
that the homeless both eat from 
and sleep In the same dumpster; 
and, II IS nor so uncommon to see 
them running awa)' lrom the 
dumpsters , shocked and 
awakened by the roar of the dump 
truck on their wa), to be cru~hed 
alive and mIxed wlrh the garbage. 
One only wonders how many have 
not made II out 01 the dumpsters 
L)n time, before they have \',mlshed 
for good. 

The problem of the homeless IS J 
nJlIonal one, and no region seem~ 
Immune from It It IS estimated that 
indIVIduals who lack permanent 
shelter for an)' slgnIilcJIlI length of 
lime ma), suffer J decrease In life 

~ xpectanc)' of 20 10 30 yea~ 
Proven true , thiS could be 
tantamount (0 selecllve gena Ide . 

It IS appalling to have such a 
problem In light l)f the abundance 
of natural and human resources, as 
well as the sClentlft .Ind 
technological know-ho\~ That II 
eXists Within ,I governmental 
structure essenllally based on 
equality and JU~lIce for all , thiS 
problem ha~ no place In SOllCt) 

ince 1960, 41 nations have ended 
hunger as a basic, soclcry-wlde 
Issue. The combined matenal 
resources of all these nallons 
would perhaps be less th ,m th e 
U nlled tate. Yet, th e), hdve 
ac hieved whdt would have seemed 
Impossible three decade ago. The 
United States can achI eve I,uger 
goal In a lesser time; we must do 
so In this case. 

In a nation that th rows away 
enough foodstu ff to feed more than 
its curre nt populatio n, there 
should be no need fo r people to 
search the garbage In order to feed 
themselves. 

ce nes of the corpses In the 
sm:ets of l os Angeles, and of other 

illes In th is vast n,u ion. arc not 
the prod ucts of fa ntaSies once seen 
In Hollywood hlms, nor Jre they

misplaced priorities. The)' find 
limited programs, reguldtlon

They are in dire need of help. 

The opportunl tic and dU<l1 
application of legal and Judicial 
protection, or lack or it , is 
unparalleled in the case of the 
homeless, ThiS dual application 
(one for the ri ch and anoth er lor

Some exception may apply to 
religiOUS organl zarions in this

too major in nJture and scope for

An impOrtdnt pOint to conSider 
IS the danger of dismiss ing the

Ignoring rhe needs of these

Immoral and uncivilized, may be a

NNIFER HAS AN JEGLY SECRET. · · 



6 Thursday. May H . 198 i 

Renowned Hollywood wrangler and part-time stuntman Lance Montana made another attempt to capture a pair 
of Mountain Fresh Rainiers spotted near Lake Arrowhead last week, "We herded 'em up a draw with he helicop-
ter. and nearly had 'em when they turned suddenly and bolted into an open meadow," he said . "Once they got 
clear it was no contest. They headed for the hills in a cloud of dust, I think they were laughing at us . " When asked 
if he thought these fresh and ftavorful creatures from the remote Pacific Northwest would ever be caught , 
Montana was skeptical. " If I can 't do it, I don't know who can , We nearly crashed two bikesjust trying 0 keep up 
with them. And [think they got some moves we ain 't even seen yet." These MFR 's, as they arc known, have been 
spotted all the way from Fresno 10 the border, so the great taste and thirst-quenching properties of the golden, 
carbonated I iquid they are rumored to contain will almost certainly lead to more capture attempts in the near future .

VIC tim 01 rape:' ,md thai ,I "V,ISI 
m,IJonty 01 the~ womcn knew 
thclr dssailant," but 90 perccnt 01 
[hem ncvc r CO nt,lctcd the police . 

Hayden ,llso statcd that the "1,lCt 
of thc matter IS our universities and 
colleges havc , In the past . been 
somcwhar I nscnsitivc" to the 
acquaintance rape problem and 
praised an excellent statement by 
the Chancellor at UC Berkeley.md 
an exce llent draft statement of 
proposed procedures at UClA 
Hayden sees thiS as an example of 
the growing ,mention being pdid 
today to acquaintance rape by 
collegcs and universities. He 

.believes, however, that "there IS 
stili a long way to go." 

Hayden says that thc main 
objective of the bill is to "clarify in 
the code.ju t as hazing was put in 
the education code as a cnme 
years ago, that rape be Similarly 
trea ted in the code." The 
accompanying re solution IS 
intended to speed up increasing 
awareness about the problem on 
campuses. 

Lieutenant J. Dyer of the UCSD 
police department would like to 
see the language of the tAli 
clarified, becau e, 10 his view, it 
comes perilously close (10 the part 
advocating inve tlgatlon of ,I 
pos ible rapist without ,j formal 
complaint) to treatment of an 
indiVidual .IS guilty until proven 
innocent. Hc stressed, though, that 

[he policc dep,ll'tmcnr "c,tn't S,I}' 
pro or con" dbow the prnp<)~cd 
leglsl,lIHln until they gct w<mllrom

The reluclJnce 01 Victims III Ilk' .I 
complaint or to conlront .I suspect 
stems . 111 pan, from people's 
"tllludc toward s the tre,l[me nt or 
r,lpe victims. "The problem:' Virga 
said, "is that right now women also 
don't really support other women 
that arc raped .. espeCially 111 
C.lseS of gang rdpes that occur 
during panics like the highly-
publiCized rape at a fmtemity 
party, wi lh many women blamll1g 
the Victim because "she should 
have known better . .. she should 
have known there W<lS drinking 
there ," 

Virga sees societies' altitudes 
towa rd rape gradually changing, 
but If is still an almost unbearable 
ordeal for a ViCtim to report sexual 
assault ,md be treated as Ir she were 
gUilty by those around her. 1l the 
oncnder is brought to mal, the 
victi m has her character "morality" 
questioned: in a sense, she is put 
on tnal. 

Virga stressed that rape IS not 
just a women's issue and rhat men 
should nm bc trcated as "the 
enemy:" they arc often .11 0 Victims 
of rape. he is now in the process 
of forming a discussion group for 
men and is seeking the suppOrt of 
the student body for thiS effon.

,Ibour 50 perce nt 01 rhe employee 
University-wide who will be 
entering the A&PS pldn arc at the 
lOp of their grJde, or r,mge, as I[ IS 
also cdlled . "Then "II you ever gOt 
was the range adjustment. and you 
got that no matte r how poorly, or 
how well , you periormcd ," sa id 
Wilson, 

A6.:rPS does not eitmlnJte rJ nge 
Jdjustments, which ,ldJust e,lch 
s<llary grade for inflation on ,I 
yearly baSIS, but it docs eliminate 
COLA, which boosts Incomes dt 
the Sdme rate as inflation In order 
to keep employees' wages at the 
same re lative level. th erefore 
moving salanes upward (assuming 
In l1ation) ar the arne rate as the 
range. laird sa id he wams 10 sec an 
automatiC COLA " .IS a noor for 
evcry emplo)'ee. so that If you don't 
ge r ,I merit Increa e, ,It leJst you 
don't lose real doll"rs to mflanon. 

"Wc're in a fdirly low inflation 
time right now but, all you have 10 
do IS thtnk back SIX years ago, "nd 
If you got a zero salJry tncrease , 
you would lose ... ntne or ten or 
cleven percent of your real dollar 
spendtng In one year, and what's 
unfair IS you've done an dclequarc 
job and th erc just isn't enough 

money to (und menr I nc re,I'iC~ ," 
laird SJld . 

Wilson belicve~ the elimll1dt lOn 
01 COLA will h,II'ITI only non-
perlormll1g employees. "SUPCrvl-
.,or" had no \\',IY tll reward people 
who \\ c re rc all >' dOing a

don't mllYe, their s,II,\I'IC don't 
move, Jr rhe SJmc lime the r,mge 
mow'i, their sdla ry move~ on the 
baSIS of mem. So, 1m example, if 
you've got somebody th,1['s really 
nor performlllg, you don't hdve 10 
give thc m ,Inyth Ing." Wilson 
added , With a sitght chueklc. th ,1[ 
rh at would be a "real tncentl ve to 
perlorm," 

Mem PJy. then, IS the key to 
A6.:rPS, .1I1d the center or debate 
ove r thc plan. Laird wrote 111 hiS 
edllortJI that "A6.:rPS presentcrs 
h,lVe d<lngled before us JPpealing 
potential yearly s" lal'}' Increases ... 
but none 01 the presenters could 
gUdrdntee thJt enough money 
would be ,llIocate 10 lund the A6.:rPS 
meri t increases ,1[ whd! most 01 us 
would agree IS a r'lir level." 
Referring to the Management and 
Proressio nal ( MAP ) plan 
Implemented last July I , he wri tes 
rhJt these em ployees werc 
promised merit increases of up ro 
25 perccnt. but "mem IIlcreases It) r 
MAP werc subscquently senously 
underrunded' MAP employces at 
Berkeley JverJged J 5 7 pcrcent 
total sJlary inC rc,lse , the lowest or 
any ca tegl)ry 01 university 
em ployees." 

However, Roben L. Balle}', an 
employee at Berkeley who IS undcr 
the MAP plan , SJys Ihat ~IAP- type 
employees (when there W,IS no 
MAP) "alway~ did more poorly .IS ,I 
group." For him, there has been 
"no ch,mge" with [he move to MAP

except for the loss of COLA 
[n response to Laird 's statement 

dbout the "underrundll1g" of MAP, 
and hiS belief that the same thll1g 
could happen to A6.:rPS, Wilson 
said the "Ihe tate 01 Cal iforn ia IS 
not gOing to give us any more 
mone}' than we've ever had in the 
p.ISt. but they're nO! giving us any 
Ie~s money (either) ." While 
cl1n(edll1g there wll! not be enough 
money 10 give merlt II1creases to aU 
those who deserve It, beCduse so 
many employees arc at the top of 
Ihelr r<lnges, the ASSistant Vice-
Chancellor Sdid it WJS "a hell of a 
lot bener than saying that yO Ui best 
performers dorr't get any mert[ 
Incredses." 

The ranges will be continuously 
movll1g upward , dnd how much 
they move wHl be primarly 
determll1ed by the amount of 
money rhe s late givcs the 
University, ,IS well as by rhe need 
lor rhe Unive rsity to keep wage 
P,lI'Ity wi th the ours Ide world. As a 
result , It IS unlikely that ,myone will 
re,lch the top of their salary range, 
.1 feature Wilson caUs "a very 
pOSitive kll1d of thing. Every year. 
when the range moves, their 
(A6.:rPS employees) salary doesn't 
move with thar. their salary moves 
.IS J lunclton of merit. And so year 
after year they Will keep right up 
rh e with rhe range, probably." 

Laird . like Wilson, believes that 
J merltocracy can be a fa ir way to 
ensure the ,lVJilable money goes to 
tho: people that deserve It most. 
"Almost everybody would agree to 
the notion of reward ll1g mem," 
Sdld Laird . 'Only a lunatic would 
SJY tholt rhdr's .I bold Idea . I'm not 
opposed to mert[ 111 crease s If

LaVerne to host

Although UCSD has the beSt 
overall record In the \\ estern 
regIon, the best DIVISIon !II record 
and has won three of four gamr~ 
from its opponent, It wtll not be 
hosting the best-of-five playo ff s 
thIS weekend . Instead . the games 
will be held at the home field of ItS 
nval , LaVerne. 

The reason for the deCISIon was 
the supenonty of the facilities at 
LaVerne's field . Olsen field (at 
UCSD) does not have covered 
dugouts , a permanent flagpole , ora 
pubhc address system, all of whIch 
can be found at laVerne . Also. 
Olsen Field has just one dnnking 
fountam . 

"In the committee's Judgment, it 
chose the best facilities available ," 

saId JIm Bowen. chairman or the 
IA c!- t RegIOn baseball commmee 
and P E, chaIrman at Cal State 
tan lsI,lus. "Reco rd IS not a 

co nslde rarlon ." 
Accordll1g [0 Bowen, the CM 

rules do not allow for a team ' 
record to be a basis for Judgment. 
Rather. the quahry of the field must 
be the only factor considered . 

everrheless, Triton coach Lyle 
Yates was mIldly surprised. "It was 
surprising because we have a better 
record overall, we have a better 
Division III record , and we beat 
them 3 out of 4," he said. 

He also feels that the decision 
may have been politically 
motivated. According [0 Yates.

Conference final , defending 
Stanley Cup champIons and 
perennial powerhouse Montreal 
Canadians staged a ome-from- ,

Philadclphid Flyers to make the 
series 3-2 in favor of Philadelphia. 
After being swept in two straight 
games and coming within one 
game of elimination from the 
playoffs, the Canadians topped the 
Flyers 5 to 2 on the loser's home 
ice.

Belushi's 
career An Arts Magazine Serving the UCSD Community 

Volume 15, Number 7 Thursday, May 14, 1987 

• IS on 

"Timing," says Jim Belushi 
"is one of the necessary 
elements for comedy." The 
actor/comedian more than 
demonstrated this in a recent 
interview concerning his two 
latest films, due for release in 
August. The slimmed-down 
Belushi said, "In general, I 
find comedy more difficult 
than drama , With drama, 
everyone can relate to the 
heaviness of the moment, but 
comedy is more of a technical 
thing and humor is 
subjective, " 

Belushi feels lucky that he 
has been able to do both 
within his 12-year career. The 
Chicago-native got his start at 
Second, City, the improvisa-
tional theatre that also trained 
his notorious older brother, 
John. 

Belushi concedes that, early 
in his career, his name was a 
handicap. "I had to work 
three times as ha rd as 
everybody else. I had to dispel 
people's preconceived 
notions, establish the role and 
then do it well," Belushi said. 
"Now, I am extremely proud 
of the name, the fact it is in the 
public's mind, and of John," 

Belushi majored in speech 
while at the University of 
Illinois. He sees no use for a 
degree in theatre, he says, 
"you learn theatre by doing 
it," Belushi finds stagework 
easier to do than film, He 
stresst!d that "with theatrt! 
you have total control and 
you get instant feedback. Film 
is a director's medium, on tht! 
set no one can rt!act, Aftt!r the 
cut, you look to the director 
for approval. You have to 
trust the director, he can make 
or break you." 

Belushi's film credits 
include "Thief," "The Man 
With One Red Shoe," and the 

by marla hellman 
controversial political film 
"Salvador." He found that 
working with director Oliver 
Stone on "Salvador" was 
intense. "You'd be having 
lunch, joking around, then 
we'd shoot a scene like the 
burial scene , Emotionally, as 
an actor, you're there; in 
reality, it tears you up, I was 
depressed for three days 
following that scene." 

Belushi recreated Bernie 
Lithko from the 1979 Apollo 
Theater Center's production 
"Sexual Perversity," for the 
film "About Last Night," 
Belushi says, "The guy is 
excellent at cursing, and 
though he doesn't get Laid, 
he's funny, open, broad and 
pathetic;" he's also Belushi's 
favorite and most memorable 
character, 

When asked who he'd like 
to work with next, he replied , 
"Mel Gibson - he turns my 
girlfriend on and I'd just like 
to be there when it happens," 
He continued, "But seriously, 
I can't work with just 
anybody, I'm very demand-
ing. I work very hard and if 
someone isn't concentrating, I 
can't work." 

Belushi found working with 
his "Real Men" co-star, John 
Ritter, to be "a perfect 
juxtaposition." He said, "Off 
the set, Ritter talked a lot and I 
laughed, and on screen it was 
vice versa." "Real Men" is an 
action-comedy about a 
legendary CIA sensation, 
Nick Parandello (Belushi) and 
his unWilling new charge, Bob 
Wilson (Ritter), a mild-
mannered civilian. Belushi 
said, "'Real Men" leaves you 
feeling good, It also has satire 
about what it means tu be a 
real man," 

Regarding his recent 
weight-loss, Belushi remarks 

target 

that previously "in Chicago I 
was considered a real man. 
But in L.A. I was considered 
heavy ." He continued, "I've 
never felt better in my life, I 
realize tha t I'm the product 
and [ have to take care of that 
product, " 

Belushi seems to have a 
realistic sense of the 
"industry. " He says. "As 
much as we want to talk about 
the art and beauty of show 
business, it's a business about 
money , It has to do with 
numbers - does it have legs? 
how can it be made?" But you 
can tell he al 0 loves the show 
part of it as well. 

In "The Principal" Belushi 
sta rs as a high schoo I 
principal, faced with the 
toughest teaching challenge of 
his career, Shot in the old 
Merrit College campus in 
Oakland, the film utilized 
neighborhood kids to add 
'street' realism. Although 
Belushi did spend a year 
teaching high school when he 
finished college, he says, "The 
biggest problem we had in this 
upper-middle class school was 
the kids making out after the 
bell. " 

Occasionally going to 
universities to give It!ctures. 
Belushi says "I still enjoy 
teaching, I often go just to 
ht;ar where college people's 
sensibilities are. And colleges 
are where you find new 
humor, " 

Belu~ni considers Jackie 
Gleason, Bill Murray and 
John Belushi to be his role 
models. He says "I'm not a 
stand-up comic, but an actor 
who's done humor." With 
two films cominl.!: out this 
summer, and other projects in 
the works, it looks like this 
32-year old actor,>tomedian's 
timing is right.

"Muzak for YuppIes" 
appropriately describes most 
of Wtndham Hill 's boring, 
humdrum New Age mu!C. 
Fortunately there have been 
some exceptions, the mo t 
recent bemg" ign Language" 
from Montreux, a new 
incarnation of several WH 
artists. 

Windham Hill's newest allows each mUSICian a final solo statement, with all instruments eventually 
reaching agreement as the 
piece terminates. Montreux's 
"Sign Language" is an 
unexpected pleasant surprise 
on the Windham Hill label. 

Montreux is Darol Anger 
(the original violimst with the 
David Grisman Quintet) on 
i'iolin, Mike Marshall on 
guitars and mandolin, 
Michael Manring on bass and 
systhesizers, and the 
fabulously talented Barbam 
Higbie on piano, systhesizers 
and voice. Their sound is a 
fusion of jazz, bluegrass, and 
folk music. 

"Sign Language" opens 
with "Skywriting," a piece 
whose description can best be 
communicated if the reader 
imaglOes drifting in a balloon 
qUietly above wide-open 
gras y fields, the beauty 
accented by the gentle early 
morning sunlight . The album 
ontinues with an intricate 

musical conversation amongst 
Higbie 's piano and Anger's 
violin. The tabla, played by 
Benjy Wertheimer, domin-
ates the rhvthm tracks. 

"To Be" exposes Higbie's 
excellent compositional and

Darol Anger. Their collabora-
tion has lasted through several 
projects, culminating with 
Montreux. 

"Grant Wood ," written by 
Anger, is influenced by the 
folk stringy sounds of 
Grisman's music. The lead 
oscillates between acoustic 
guitar and violin, slowly 
intensifying, finally reaching a 
plateau and then abruptly 
switching mood to Higbie's 
gentle piano. 

The album concludes with a 
hint of blues from "Jm.t

A band with a Mission Check it out 
It took just one year for the 

Mission U.K. to get where they 
are now. Where they are is at 
the top of the Br i tish 
independent Ii tings, on the 
receiving end f rave reviews 
from critics throughout 
Europe, watching their first 
U. . sing le, "Wasteland," 
steadily climb the charts, and 
they're here, touring America. 

It was JUSt a year ago, 
according to Mission 
drummer Mick Brown, that 
singer Wayne Hussey and 
bassist Craig Adam , both ex-
members of Sisters of Mercy, 
recruited him for their new 
project. "When Sisters broke 
up," said Brown, "I kne ... " 
what wa happening because I 
had been living 10 ralg' 
hou e. They sauJ they had 
some new stuff and that they 

. wanted to start workingwlth a 
drummer." After beingjotned 
with gUItarist imon Hinkler, 
the band had only ten hort 
days of rehearsal before 
playing their first live show , 
openi ng for The ulr as 
MISSion u.K. 

Encouraged by "ecstatic " 
audience re ponse and 
reviews such as, "They can 
trut, sweat, and neer their 

way through a performance 
with an uncontrollable 
whiplash ene rgy that is ajoy to 
behold ('Melody Maker')," the 
band then worked hard to 
release an album and embark 
on a tour of America. Luckily, 
Mission members had each 
earlier developed the 
callouses that go with such 

by ken calhoun 
labor. The driving pace, 
although exhausting, didn't 
overwhelm them. "We had all 
done this kind of thing before, 
all of us earlier being in 
bands," said Brown. "To us, 
and I wish there was a better 
way to say It, the whole thing 
was kind of old hat." 

"God's Own Medicine," 
their recently-released debut 
album, brought the band 
attention in America. The 

single "Wasteland," in heavy 
rota tion on 91 X, best 
exemplifies thu band's 
"brooding, yet dynamic" 
sound. The MlSSfun ets down 
a teady foundation of bas. 
guitar and drums, to be 
tl'xtu rl'd th rough the 
synthesizers, strings, and 
singer Wayne Hussey 's 
Gothic lyrics. The band uses 
melodic arrangements to 
sweeten the album's 
bitterness. 

Also added is a heavy 
serving of sarcasm that is 
best seen in the album's 
opening line in which Hussey 
intones, I still be/iew in God, 

hut God no longer believes in me. 
Brown explained, "One day 
Wayne called us over to the 
studio. 'Come hear what I've 
Jone to "Wasteland," , he 
says. When we heard the 'I 
still believe in God, ' we all fell 
about laughing. It's such a 
pompous thing to say." 

incl' then, the band has hit 
the road in Ameri ca, 
headlining their own tour. 
The reaction 0 far, claIms 
Brown, is building, with each 
night bringing greater 
re ponse. Though the music IS 
stripped down to the baSICS 
Instrumentally, the band has 
managed to build a strong 
reputation among concert-
gO~'r . "I thlllk the show tS a 
~uu_ess because we try to 
make studiO Itve tnstcaJ ot 
maktng live studiO," said 
Brown. "What's tripped 
away by the stage IS maJe up

Applauded with a triple 
standing ovation from a 
crowd of about 700 cheering 
and dancing fans, the 
performance of Chilean 
musical group Quilapayun last 
Thursday night at the North 
Park Theatre was a 
triumphant success. Accor,

1973, has been performing 
throughout Europe with their 
plea for "peace and an end to 
the outrage (of the victims of 
government persecution), " as 
stated by Ubilla-Arenas. 

anthems of hope and pride. 
Humorous and sarcastic skits 
were performed between 
songs which mocked the 
corruption and propaganda of 
the media in Chile. A solo 
poem opened the show with a 
dedication to the audience: 

My country is song and poetry, 
Creation of peace on earth. 

Coordinated by UCSD 
student Dora Cobian, the 
show carried the audience 
along from sorrowful ballads 
to uplifting emotional 

Cultural Center (LACC), the ,--------------------__ ----l 
purpose of the concert was to 

See QUILAPAYUN, page 7 

"help further the cause for the 
restoration of democracy in 
Chile. " 

Quilapayun, a South 
American word meaning 
"bearded men," is composed 
of nine members (of which 
only three actually wear 
beards) who play various 
instruments of Andean Indian 
folklore. Long bamboo flutes, 
tiny ~igh,pitched guitars, and 
"sampona" or Pipes of Pan 
gi ve the music a magical sound 
permeated with mysterious 
drum rhythms and vocal calls. 
The songs, all in Spanish, are 
drawn from South American 
culture and contain social and 
political comments referring 
to the need for solidarity 
among the people of Chile 
against the current ruling 
junta.

Pushing 
a 
• pOInt 

by rebecca jaurigue 
Robert McEntee, as a local 

musician, does not expect of 
anyone else what he would 
not ask of himself. So last year 
when he and Ivan Knight, 
another local musician, set up 
The Pushing - show ases of 
underground art from a 
Christian perspective -
M cEntee was out to challenge 
everyone involved . The 
Pushing happens again 
tomorrow night, May IS, at 
the Che Cafe . 

"In thinking about the 
direction where Christ ia n 
musicians and artists were 
going in San Diego, we saw a 
strong need to have a place to 
perform, " McEntee viewed. 
"There needed to be a forum 
where Christian artis ts could 
get to work on their ideas and 
establish themselves." 

McEntee continued, " It's a 
very limited market in San 
Diego or anywhere for 
Christian musicians, even if 
their music Isn't especially for 
the Christian crowd. If they 're 
aiming for the secular crowd, 
which most of our bands are 
dOing, we're trying to create a 
place where these musicians 
are getting better." 

So far The Pushing has 
featured local bands The 
ReStScance, The Hldmgmask, 
and Souls In ExIle. With the 
past thr ee shows, " th e 

difference has been that 
people who come never really 
know what to expec t, other 
than seeing quality work going 
on and feeling enough a part 
of it to return." 

Since the fall of 1986, The 
Pushing has presented a 
unique opportunity for civic 
involvement as well as artisitc 
expression. All proceeds from 
the three previous shows went 
to aid the San Diego YWCA, 
hospital costs for a girl 
suffering from bulimia, and 
the downtown Catholic 
Refugee R e setrlement 
program. Every show of The 
Pushing will target the 
proceeds tow ard other 

community needs. 
And what kind of people 

does The Pushing want to be 
involved with? " W e're not a 
trend or a scene. We're 
looking for people that come 
to grow with us in 
appreciating the art and music 
that is going on." 

Music showcase as well a 
community benefit? U nder-
ground and Christi anity? 
Definitely a connection for 
art-minded and socially-aware 
individ uals to experience. 
McEntee opens Friday night'S 
show at 8 pm with a solo 
acoustic guitar set. Also 
appearing will be local bands 
The Sacred and Pome Blank.

ttjoe" has willpower 
by david forman 

ince beginning his career 
in the late seventies, Joe 
Jackson has always tried to 
stay one step ahead of his 
CTltI CS. By c hanging hi 
musical style as often a most 
rock stars change hair style, 
Jackson has remained 
somewhat of a nemesis to top 
forty radio stations and 
listeners. Though a few of his 
songs have become hits 
("Stepping Out," "You Can't 
Get What Yo u Want"), the 
majority of his artistry has 
passed by without notice. His 
new album " Will Power", an 
instrumental assortment of 
classical arrangements, is 
likely also to be passed by. 
Though it is not his best 
effort, not listening to this 
would be unfortunate. 

If Jackson can attest to one 
thing in his career it is that he 
has always done things his 
way. From his early punk days 
of "Beat Crazy" and "I'm the 
Man", to his more bluesy 
intellectualism of "Body and 
Soul," Jackson has always 
chosen artistry over 

commercia lism . After the 
success of his "Look Sharp" 
album, heralded by many as 
h is best album, Jackson 
decided to cut "J umping 
Jive, " a co llection of silly, but 
irresistible be-bop jazz tunes. 
Last year, he released " Big 
World, " a synthesi of hi 
varied styles, on three sides of 
a double album set, leaving 
ide four blank. He recorded 

the album live in three days 
directly to a two-track digital 
master , asking the audience 
not to cheer until the songs 
were completely finished. 

This year Jackson has paved 
his own way once again with 
"Will Power." Though 
Jackson fans should be used to 
his changes by now, even the ' 
most ardent "Joe" fan should 
be warned as to the content of 
the new album. "Will Power" 
contains five songs written, 
orchestrated and produced by 
Jackson. The first song "No 
Pasaran" is the most annoying 
piece of the set, consisting of a 
soft, almost nonexistent

Book Review 

Educated thriller 
by john kearney -

Author Jonathan Keller-
man has quite an interesting 
and impressive background. 
Prior to earning a Ph .D . in 
cl inical p ychology at l,JSC, 
his list of credits included 
c artoonist, tea her, edit r , 
a nd even musician. His 
specializa tion in children's 
psychology has been the basis 
for three thriller-type novels 
that blend intriguing suspense 
and disturbing psychological 
c rimes. 

Kellerman's latest work, 
Otler [he Edge (Atheneum), is 
the third book to feature the 
heroic psychologist-detective 
Alex Delaware. Delaware 
receives a mysterious call in 
the middle of the night from 
his former patient, Jamey 
Cadmus. An adolescent 
geni us on the verge of 
madness, Cadmus escapes 
from a psychiatric hospital 
and is linked to a series of 
kinky, brutal murders. As he 
explores the o r igins and 
depths of psychotic behavior, 
Delaware uncovers a 
conspiracy to frame Cadmus 
for the murders. 

Over [he Edge, like most 
detective and crime novels, is 
written in the first person. 
Although it i not unimagina-

tive, Kel lerman's pro e often 
follows the true tough-guy 
Spillanean mode with all of its 
cheesi ness intact: 

The hutldmg sat in th e middle 
of ch e h/o..;k, L'mhroidcrcd a! 
street level with u dUlSy cham

cans and dogshic rurned my 
/)ro,t;ress dol.l.'T1 the sidewalk 
inlO a s/>astic hallet. The 
doors were rusted Iron , 
wur/>cJ and dented , and sec 
into the crumhling bYlck 
facade of [h e former factory 
like a fis tula. 
The major task of writing a 

novel is a slow and laborious 
process for Kellerman. He 
usually spends six to eight 
months writing a plot and 
character outii:1e, which can 
sometimes be as long as 80 
pages. He then sits down to do 
the actual wri ting. In one day, 
he writes for four or five 
hours, sometimes not even 
looking at the outline, and 
then subjects himself to the 
e xh a ustive process of 
rewriting. He attributes his 
ability to endure all of this to 
his active imagination and 
lov e fo r storytelling. 
However, Kellerman 's work 
was not immediately accepted 
by publi hers . He claims that, 

like any other author, he has 
had h IS shan: of rejection 
slips. " Basically ," he says, "it

rea on "Dead Man's Party" 
faded was because they tried 
t o co mmer cialize their 
" wei rdness." so to speak. 
With songs like "No One 
Lives F rever" and the title 
track, the rest of the nation 
was being encouraged to 
understand what people on 
the Los Angeles club sene 
liked. " Boi-ngo" doesn't have 
that annoying "play me, Mr. 
O .J." quality. 

Most of side two loses the 
playfulness that side o ne has, 
leaving a couple of more 
"pop-y" tunes ("We Close 
Our Eyes" and "Not My 
Slave") which will appeal to a 
generalized group of music 
listeners. It's the type of stuff 
which, unlike their previous 
works, can actually be played 
on popular radio. They are 
still quality tracks; as a matter 
of fact, they are two of the 
strongest songs on the album, 
probably meant to be an 
introduction to the rest of the 
world. 

My two personal favorites 
of the album, however, are 
" My Life" and " Pain." Like 
" Home Again," they both 
carry strong themes which 
deal a lot with the real world 
which surrounds us. "My 
Life" deals with growing o lder 
and " Pain" concerns, guess 
what ... the pain people deal ' 
with in their every day live. 
Musica 11 y, the songs are 
brazen, giving the listener ' 
more than just words, but 
feelings as well. What we give 
up in wackiness, we gain in 
meaning. 

Oin,l{o Boin,l{u has grown up. 
Many may condemn the band 
for reaching a new insight with 
their music, but then agai n, 
stylistic changes have worked 
for o ther bands; it should 
work with Oin,l{o. Elfman has 
said that as soon as the band 
feels stagnant, they will break 
up. Hopefu lly, this won't 
happen in the near future. 
And if "Boi-ngo" i any 
indicarlon, it h uldn't . 

And for the Jie-hards out 
there who hate any kind of 
change: .hill o ut! There's 
more to life than outrageously 
tastdes tunes.

melody, intruded upon by a 
crash of strings every minute 
or so. This goes on for over 
five minutes before reaching 
a climax, which is not worth 
the wait . 

The next compOSItIOn, 
"Solitude" is a standard 
classical interlude, nicely 
blendi~g the emphasis of the 
horns and the wind 
instruments. The title track, 
" Will Power" sounds 
distinctly lik e ea rly 
Mannheim Steamrol ler 
recordings, cleverly using the 

. orchestration to create a 
modern twist to the notions of 
classical music. This process 

. has been recently coined as 
" New Age" music. Though 
this piece is at times powerful, 
it is not worthy of its title. 

"Nocturne" is the o nly 
piece from the album that 
Jackson pLays on. It is a 
beautiful piano ballad, which 
shows off jackson's talents 
not only as a musician, but as a 
composer as well. It alone is 
worth the price of the album. 

The most ambit ious piece 
of the album is the fifteen 
minute "Symphony in One 
Moveme nt." Originally 
written as background music 
for a Japanese film shown at 
the 1985 Expo in Japa n, 
Jackson reworks his version 
to utilize a full orchestra. The 
results are varied, with parts 
of it being slow and dull, but 

on a whole it is a success. 
From a critical standpoint, 

" Will Power" is a nice, 
relaxing album for the listener 
whose record collection, or 
compact disc collection 
includes the New Age sounds 
of Windham Hill artists and 
Fresh Aire . It is more 
traditional, than these records 
however, and may be better 
suited for the classical purist. 
The obvious problem is trying 
to convince the purist that 
Jackson has actually produced 
an album which could be 
accura tel y descr i bed as 
'beautiful. ' (I can't imagine 
playing "Is she really going 
out with him" to somebody, 
and then trying to convince

Songs were dedicated to other 
revolutionary figures such as

Roberto Matta. 

The show was greatly 
appreciated by many UCSD

Paola Correa commented, "I 
came with my parents and we 
felt that it was truly uplifting

Villareal said, "It is amazing to

Although concert itself 
did not make a profit, it was 
considered very successful by 
the LACC, who plan to 
promote more shows in the 
future. Ubilla-Arenas 
explained that it was not 
expected to bring in returns, 
but to "break the taboos and 
challenge the myth of San 
Diego not being able to have a 
concert of this type." Cobian 
said that future shows will 
hopefully raise money to help 
the cause in Chile. In a few 
months they are expecting 
appearances from the jtroups

them that the same artist is 
responsible for "Will 
Power") . This album is for the 
lover of music, not a rock fan, 
though it will be mistakenly 
placed in the rock section with 
Jackson's other albums. 

Jackson said tttat his album 
would test his fans, and he 's 
correct. Even for the fan that 
has enjoyed all of Jackson 's 
stages in the past, this may be 
too m,uch of a radi cal 
departure. Bur if you've 
journeyed with Jackson this 
far, through the stages of 
obnoxious egotism, th en 
"Will Power," a title uniquely 
attributable to Jackson 's 
perseverance, is worth 
cQntinuing the journey.

move on to performance art. His interest" arose out of an 
interest in storytelling and the oral tradition," Berne 
explained. It also involved a lot of self-scrutinizing of 
himself and his art. "Self-criticism is an integral pa rt of 
developi ng art," Berne stated. 

It was through this "self-criticism that Berne discovered 
the idea of cooking as a basis for his performan es. "It's 
not a gimmick," Berne stated, "it's an attempt to bring art 
closer." He went on to expain that it is easy for himself 
and the audience to relate to the domesticity of cooking. 
In order to involve the audience even more in his 
performances, Berne often serves the food he prepares 
when the audience is small enough. 

According to some historians, the origin of performing 
art can be traced back to medieval rituals and ceremonies. 
The tradition was then carried on by the Bauhaus in 
Germany and Russian constructivists. Though interest 
dwi ndled, pe rformance art enjoyed a resurgence in 
Europe and the United States in the 1960s. One of the 
leaders in the performance art field is Allan Kaprow, the 
current head of the Visual Arts department at UCSD. 
When asked about the futu re of performance art, Berne 
simply stated, "I have no idea." As for his own personal 
future he said, " Keep doing my work ." Presently that 
includes performances in Los Angeles next spring.
