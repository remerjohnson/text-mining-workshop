'Saxon Will Go 'All 
Out' Against Jarvis II 

.New Chancellor by March? . 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

News Editor 
UC Pre.ident David Saxon 

launched what he called a "peraonal 
campaign" against the Jarvi. II 
initiative here yesterday, but called on 
the .y.tem'. admini.trator. and 
professor. to do their bett to help him. 

"I'm fed up with this kind of 
~pproach to government in 
California," Saxon said. "I want all of 
you to help develop the facta. We need 
anaIy.is to convince the voters that 
Jarvia II is wrona, no scare .tories, just 
the facta. 

"The university is uniquely well· 
qualified to get ~ormation out to the 
public. We.houId apeak to these iaauet 
and try to inform the public." 

Saxon told a meeting of about 100 
Academic Senate member. that whie 
he waa not conceding the paa188e of 
the tax·cutting measure, ita effecll 
would be "dreadful." 

"It'. not like that 1 0 percent cut we 
were aaked to figure lut year ,tt Saxon 
said in response to a queation. "Ow 
retponte then w.. calculated to 
.,..aaade (the governor) not to cut

Pregnancy 'Test-in' is 
On lor Today in State 

A pregnartCY "te.t·in" wiD be held ' in San Diego thi. 
afternoon aa part of a .tat~e demonltration by women'. 
IIOUP' and health clinics against a recent .tate ruling barring 
non·medical pregn~y testing. 

The free pregnancy testins demonstrations wiD show "how 
euy it is" for women to determine whether they are pregnant, 
accordi", to VICkie Algarin, a health worker for Women 
Care, one of the or,anizations involved in the cIemonatration. 

The teat·in is in relponle to a December ruling by .tate 
Attorney General Gecqe DeuIanejian that prepancy testa 
can be done only by women requetting the telt, women's 
immediate family member. or thole licenled for "practici",

The nWni pro~ =ti. clinic cowueIon and other non· 
medical perlOna from conductinl the tesll. 

The ruling "draatically affects women'. ability to have 
control over their own health care," Algarin say •. 

Additionally, ·the ruling wiD probably eliminate free 
pregnancy telting at health clinics, since such clinics mu.t 
now hire technicians to analyze the tesll, according to 
Algarin. 

The tett·in will be conducted at 2 pm today at the Center 
for Women'. Study and Services, 908 F St.

Lobby Conference Focuses on 
Harassment, Jarvis, Draft 

BYCaro~:-y Sacramento pondent 
Approximately 100 student leader. from the 

nine UC campuses who ,athered at Davi. this 
weekend for the ninth annual utillative 
Conference organized by the Student Lobby 
boned up on a plethora of issues including 
Jarvia II, .tandarcbed lIeIlI,aexuai baraaament 
and the draft. 

Pat Callan, director of the Cornmiuion on 
POIlIeconciary Educa~ ,ave a conceptual 
overview of Jarvia II in which he ettimated that 
a pro rata cut of 30 percent for higher 
education is optimi.tic. 

"Higher education i. much more vulnerable 
than other agencies. One of the greatest 
resource. of revenue for higher education i. 
right in the student'. pocketbook," ~aid Callan. 

In addition, Callan pointed out that no law 
mandatel a formula for state .upport of higher 
education. Unlike many social program., 
which depend a ~t deal on federal matching 

funda, a withdrawal of funda from higher 
education would not produce a ripple effect. 

He felt to promote at this time The Tax 
Simplicity Initiative .. which won't go before the 
voter. until November, well after Jarvi. II i. 
decided .. would be a tactical error. 

"They tried a limilar .trategy of giving 
people an alternative with Prop 13 but even on 
the same ballot it didn't fly," said Callan. 

Callan aIao pointed out that in the Assembly 
election year there is little chance a sale tax or 
biD elimination tax exemption to reduce the 
impact of Jarvi. II would come from the 
Learialature. 

Callan warned however that the amount of 
tuition that wiD be charged to .tudents i. partly a 
political judgment. 

"Keep in mind that the admini.trator. are 
interested in mobilizing you 'folk. and while the 
tuition illue may not be the bett in dealing with 
the general public, it probably i.the beat way to

Boycott .. (:1 Small Step: Olympics Long Politicized

on iuues that are important to 
Rancho s.n.do, and they 
don't let 'em for,et it. 
Consequently, Rancho

new police alation, they aet 
one. 'There'.1'IOthiq too ,oocI

that it'. an area with a lot of

its an area the politicians have

Since Jarvia II affect. .tate income taxea, figured on a

expressed through community

came into oHice, the Board of 
Supervisors had all the land· 
ute deciaion authority 
concentrated in itself 80 that all 
the developers, if they 
controDed three votes on that 
Board. could control 
development. That wu true in 
the early ' 70s. 

When I fint came in one of 
the fint thins. I did wu 
provide for independent 
community planners. We now 
have about 50, in communit· 
ies like Santee and Lakeside. 
Tho.e groupa are now 
developing community plans 
and building codes to enforce 
them. They also review 
projects and advise us on their 
desirability in the context of 
their plan. A. a result of that, 
Harting with the neighborhood 
in term. of ,rowth and 
development, we ve had much 
better land decition., much 
more compacting and infilling, 
much more recognition of the

The City Council doesn't 
have any early warning

come in development. 
Whereas we had a debate on 
condominium conver-.ion in 
JlUalary or february 1979, it 
didn't hit the city council until 
Ausuat or September. By 
february of 1979, we already 
had a condominium conver·

prevented conversions. lbey

there wu a problem six

But Callan urged the .tudents to activate 
neverthel .. , because in hi. opinion, "Jarvia II 
i. heatable. It doesn't have the groundawell 
Prop 1"3 had." . 

As a result of a workshop on draft 
regiltration, Nancy Laga, AS vice-president, 
recommended designating feb. 11 u the date 
for a .y.temwide demonstration Her idea wu 
enthuaiaatically endorsed by the conference 
attendees . 

The workthop 'bn IeXUII haraument 
produced aeriouI concern over- the lack of a 
grievance procedure for .tudents .ullied to 
harusment. One example cited at the 

confer-ence w.. the cue of a Ber-keley 
Sociology Profeuor EIeaki Hermani, who w_ 
reprimanded by the campw adminiab"ation 
alter allegedly haraaling female .tudents. 

Another under-pad told of more subtle forme 
of haJ:aaament, citint the vice chancellor 01 one 
of the campuaes whose fint question to YOUll8 
women frequently concerned their marital 
stalus. 

The .tudent leader. decided to return to ilim

procedure, what it constitutes and how it can be 
irn~roved.

From the summer to

though, seems to breathe

Local farmlands take on

up on. It was springtime 
when I first heard that 
two large development 
firms were planning to 
level the Carmel Valley 
region to accomodate 
residences for 40,000 
people, .calling their 
vision North City West. 

I immediately went to 
all the available 
resources to find out 
why this was necessary. 
The mayor, the dry 
planners, and council 
members all came up 
with the same aplwer -

"Sa~ Diego must make 
room for th larF influx 
of people who come here 
each year to live and this 
is the molt lotPcal' place 
for expansion."

Better to get a slap on the 
hand from the City than 
to lose out on putting up 
more condos.

another L.A.·based 
development firm, 
promised the City of San 
Diego that no further 
action would be taken 
on the Cannel Valley 
Precise Plan, stage I of

the financing of schools 
was settled. In past 
weeks, though, they

Perfonnance art runi the gamut betWeen show bUliness 

and theatricized existence. At one extreme it ia a mimicry 
of life with actor. pretending per.onali~es; at ~ olh,er, it is 
the arti.t acting out the drama of hIS own Identity (or 
identities) on and offstage. 

It can range anywhere from ~If.exp~tory plays to 
incomprehensibly obscure autoblographlC~ remarks: My 
own work falls somewhere in between With my friends 

Antwash was invited into a UCSD art performance 
daIS to stage two events. "1l1is artide Is an extension o{ 
those works. 
saying I'm closer to one extr~rne; my audi~nces say the 
other. The following explanation, I hope, will refute both 
sides. th . I . I am trained as a painter wi a .Ingle course In 
performance at the Univer.ity of flo~a to lend credence 
to any claim I might make to expe~tise . La~er , as a tour 
guide at the National Gallery of Art In W,,!shington, DS, I 
had the opportunity to perform for an audieoce. Parroting 
art hi.tory being rather tedious , I relinquished my boredom 
by energizing my groups. . ' 

I encouraged their interpretation. of ,the pIeces, ,we 
jointly critiqued newly designated art obJects - chairs, 
cars the art of local students I had invited along, and we ev~ critiqued each other as art objects. 

The context of art was explored as wasthe manipulation 
of their minds by the museum and its t~ur guides . I chang~ 
the credibility of my facts by •. tarbng &Orne to~s, hair 
tou.Ied, in a leather jacket u~mg bl:oken E.ngIlsh a~ 
.witched midway into a three pIeCe suit and combed hair, 
speaking inteUectuaiese. · _ . 

Though the job became enjoyable, I couldn't climb the 
organizational ladder without a graduate degree. It was 
increasingly obvious that I wouldn't advance without one, 
and graduate school sounded more and more like a nice 
performance, 

It was suggested that I try UCSD, by a director at the 
National Endowment for the Arts, no Ie.s, and my bags 
were soon packed. I quit my job and drove for three days 
acro.s the country to perform the application. 

The two enacted ~venta concern the obligatory portfolio 
that must accompany the fine arts application. As I am 
neither prolific nor overly anxious to docwnent my work, I -
decided to pad my folio with future proposals. , 

The first event was a trial run of one of the.e polllble 
acts . It consi.ted of the following: I pas~ around a,ba~e 
stating, "l.houId stop kid~~, myadf. I m not an arti.t, I m 
nothing. I'm jUit a con arti.t! I set up my props, quoted the 
title "MetaPERphorMANCE - to be perfonned a. a 
teadaing assiatant at UCSD,", and dropped the word 

"im~ressions" into a jar to my nght. , . , 
The audience was told to dose their eyes and IMagine 

their best work. I asked them to w~t~ash their. thouihts 
and I inunediatdy crashed a ~~ anto t!'e Jar. eyes 
reopened, and they jolted down their unpres.lOn. of the act 
while I blindfolded myself. 

Paul Best collected the writings and applied whitewash 
to each .heet. I groped ~y way to, a near~y blackboard to 
draw an image of. the brick smashing the)8l'. I uncovered 
my eyes, wrote ''best ~ressio!,." beneath the. drawing 
and then obliterated the IMage With a layer of white chalk" 
It was suggested. that every,one i~ne a blindfolded brick 
crashing into a )8J' filled With blindfolds.

retrieved and real aloud, IMpresSIon.,

about their past progres,. Everybody'. best w~rk . was

Royal Romance, Abdication Disillusioning 
By Beth Aa:cmando 
Senior Staff Writer 

When Edward VIII, in hi. 
abdication speech, .aid "I 
have found it impo •• ible 
to . .. discharge my duties as 
King ... without the help and 
support of the woman I love, " 
he unwittingly made romantic 
hi.tory. His romance and 
lub.equent marriage with 
Walli. Warfidd Simpaon, an 
event that actmdaIized the 

roy~ family, is again the 
.utJ;ect of a TV ~pecial, 
Previously made as a TV fibn , 
the couple has now inspired a 
6 part miniseries entitled 
Edward and Mrs. Simpson. 

As depicted in the opening 
segment of the series, this .0. 
called " romance of the 
century" begins quite 
romantically. Prince Edward 
is shown a. a da.hing young 
man who is looked upon as a 
kind of Prince Charming by his 
female IUbjects. Out of a 
desire to remain unmarried, 
Edward has taken up a 
number of affairs with married 
women. At a party given by 
one of hi. mi.tresses , Edward 
is introduced to Wallis 
Simp.on, or more accurately, 
Wallis has herself introduced 
to him. After this encounter, 
Walli. coldly schemes her way 
into the Prince'. life and OUitS

all her rival., 
Walli.' opportunistic 

motives erase any romantic 
i1usions about her relationship 
with Edward. AJthough a 
twice divorced commoner , 
Wallis holds the self-ddusion 
that once Edward becomes 
King, he can simply insist that 
.he be hi. Queen. But as 
history .0 proved, British 
traditions are not broken .0 
easily. 

Ending with the imminent royal family and politics. Yet 
death of King George V, part even with the added interest of 

Prince Edward, Fox, an 
underrated actor who gave a 
chiIIina portrait of a paid 
assauin in Do" of tM Jacke' 
gives a finely layer;;i 
performance. Cynthia Harris 
a. Walli. fares leu well. She 
plays Wallis • too overtly 
cold and c:aIcuIatint, and 
makes Walia' rise in the 
Prince'. esteem wnbeIieveabIe.

,.....------.-----Hi. Authority Show. --------------, 

Turk Murphy Totes Staple SF Jazz SOuth 
By WiUiam Hamilton 

Traditional jazz experienced a 
resurgeoce in popularity during the late 
60'., partially attributable to the new 
interest taken in Black music and folklore. 
The tradition has been carried on long 
after the demise of such important 
composers as Scott Joplin, Jelly Roll 
Morton, Armstrong and Hardin. 

One of the most important recent 
traditional jazz bands was Lu Watters' 
Yerba Buena Jazz Band, which po~shed 
and rearranged many of the more 
interesting tunes of the 20's in addition to 
making important original contributions 
to the genre. 

Turk Murphy and his San Francisco 
Jazz Band, an offshoot of the Walters' 
group, has for a number of year. been the 
mainstay house band a~ Earthquake 

McGoon's in San Francisco, Sunday 
night, trombonist Murphy brought his, 
band to San Diego in a rare concert 
appearance before a mode.t but 
enthusia.tic audience in the Mandeville 
auditorium. 

, Murphy i. known for hi. arrangement 
prowess in revamping old performance 
standards by other artists. Hi. long 
association with Wallers and imrrJeuion 
in jazz qualifies him as an authority on the 
traditional variety, and throughout the 
performanc e he punctuated the 
intermissions between numbers by giving 
a brief background of the selection about 
to be performed and the composer. His 
perfunctory remarks were warm and 
willy , and Murphy captivated the 
audience throughout the show. 

Vocalist Pa t Yankee, a buxim, robust 

singer, was very powerful in her 
interpretations of "Rose of W .. hin,ton 
Square" and "Oh Daddy," ad.Jibbin,r 
occasionally and addin, a ribald, 
humorous touch, especiall, on some of 
the song. with .uggesti..-e lyrics. 

Her ope~ number, "A Good Man i. 
Hard to Fmd," was apeciaIIy good, 
although .he wasn't alway. dOle enouth 
to the microphone to be heard dearly. 

Murphy'. former Watters band co-
member, Bob Helm, ave the most 
impressive perfonnance on soprano sax 
and clarinet, but once .,ain, the 
poRtioning of the microphone limited 
intelligibility to hi. solo .."mellta. 

The Turk himself kept his solo.

the first set on "Get It Kight," which

MetaPERphorMANCE 
Continued from PGIle 8 

I aImo.t forllotto add a final event 10 the piece, the exposure 
of two dummy roUt of film which I pretended were the 
documentation .hot by David Wilson and Michael Lichter. Thi. 
conjob .tated my own incapacity to practice what I preach. 
A1u. 

Duma the diacuuion of MetaPERphorMANCE, Naomi 
BartuI, David, Mike and I quickly exited to prepare for the next 
work. Thia piece had to deal with the problem of selecting 
materials to tend to the ... aduate committee. 

ThoUBh scarce, my art remnanll proved to be incredibly 
diver.ified; when seen tollether it became-obvioul that they were 
nol even created by the same perlOll. Rather than 'USlLat that, I 
Jimjed the body of my portfolio to my written work, which i.

approval of a .inale member of the committee, Dr. David Antin. 

Once I realizeCI my drift in hi. direction, I knew something had 
to be done about it. I would have to perform a rituali.tic purlle. 

Annoyed with myself, I reasoned that if I felt it necaaary to 
di.tort myself for him, I IhouId 110 aU out and just imitate his 
work. It would lerVe me right, Ioaing my individuality like that. I 
tried plagiarizing a poem I found, combining it with Gertrude 
Stein' •• tyle of repetition .aUle he had relearched her writing. 
Unfortunalell1 the poem W81 1l00d. I needed aomethini to be 
.harned of. To fully purge myself of my brown-noaing I clecided 
to take the argument to it. ad absurdum extremes: I would 

1im~1y imitate the man himaeH. 
For the second event, I had my entire head and face .haved. I 

enjoyed the vilUal idea of being .haved bald .aUle my new
