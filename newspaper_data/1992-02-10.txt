Printer Breakdown 
Delays Guardian, 
San Diego Reader 
By PeterKo 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Thursday. Feb. 6edition oftheGllcmliall 
hit the stands one day late due to a printing press 
malfunction at San Dieguito Publishers in San 
Marcos. 

"We just had a serie~ of breakdowns ... It was 
a combination of seveml things at once." said 
San Dieguilo Publishers General Manager Rich-
ard Lapham. 

The breakdown also caused a delay in the 
distribution of the weekly Reader. and the debut 
of its new, completely overhauled format. 

According to Lapham. the press problems 
caused a 12-hour delay in San Dieguito's print-
ing schedule. 

"What u ually happens in thi case is that we 
have three or four places which we subcontract 
out to," he aid. 

As a result of the breakdown, the Gllardiall 
was printed at Trident Web Offset Inc. in Lemon 
Grove. and anived on campus at II p.m. Thurs-
day night. It was distributed at 8 a.m. Friday 
morning. 

The loss in advertising revenue because of the 
one-day delay is unknown. 

"There i no way to tell." said Gllardiall 
Adverti ing Manager Michael Foulks. 

Foulks added that it was the first time in the 
five-and-a-half years he has worked for the 
Gllardia" that it has not come out on time.

UCSD's ASE Members Approve 
Union Status, Join UAW's District 65 LA JOLLA BREWING COMPANY 
By Stephanie Danford 
Staff Writer 

The Association of Studem 
Employees (ASE) at UCSD is 
now an official union and has 
affiliated with District 65 of the 
United Auto Workers. [n two 
sepamte ballots sent out to ASE 
members at the end of Fall Quar-
ter 1991 and tallied in early Janu-
ary, these two motions were 
passed by overwhelmins majori-
ties. 

Linguistics Depanmenlleach-
ing assistant and ASE organizer 
John Sullivan said he was pleased 
with the results. "Wehavefonned 
a completely autonomous orga-
nization to deal with the adminis-
tration on a more equal footing." 
he said. 

According to Sullivan, the 
immediate plan is to gain a major-
ity status among graduate student 
employees. approximately 1,000 
students. by the end of spring 
quarter. Membership cards for all 
joining students would then be 
scntto the California State Public 

Employee Relations Board. which 
would celtify the cards and the 
UCSD ASE organization as a le-
gal labor union. 

Sullivan tressed that the ASE 
will help any graduate student 
employee or group of employees, 
including those not affiliated with 
the union, with employmem rela-
tions problems. 

Until the ASE is bener able to 
suppon itself financially wilh 
dues, District 65 will provide a 
budget to pay for an off-campu 
office. two graduate student 
staff members and two part-time 
organizers to help with the mem-
bership drive. 

Mary Ann Mas enburg. a 
UA W International Representa-
tive. said that District 65 does not 
expect to be repaid for its finan-
cial suppolt of the ASE. Instead. 
union officials hope to in till in 
students a confidence in unions 
through a personal, positive ex-
perience. "This is a natur.d ell-
pansion of[District6S' s] network 
among students." Massenburg 

ASE organizer John .:">.JlIIIV,," 
said. ""'s importantthat graduate 
students can reach a lot of young 
people on campus and hare Iheir 
experience. so ludents can see 
lhowlcollectiveactionand union-
ization works in a professional 
sening." 

She also noted that the affilia-
tion of the two organizations not 
only benefits the UCSD ASE. but 
also adds support· to a growing 
movement of unionization among 
academic employees.

Providing "an open forum for 
students and teachers to get to know 
one another" is the basis for UCSD's 
newest organization, known asFac-
ully Student and Staff Interaction 
(FSSI), said Melvin Green, biology 
professor and facully coordinator 
for FSSI. 

Green said that FSSI seeks to 
create an ongoing rapport between 
faculty and students and. in doing 
so, break down some of the barriers 
which hamper those relations. 

"Many students are unable to 
meet their professors, and office 
hours usually are not appropriate 
because this time is reserved for 
asking questions about course con· 
tem," said FSSI Student Coordina-
tor ClJris Giangreco. a Revelle Col-

Forthatreason,FSSI i intended 
to foster the difficult-to-<>btain so-
cial interaction between faculty and 
students. 

TIle end result hoped for is the 
creation of a bener learning envi-
ronment at UCSD. 

In creating that environment. 
Green added, FSSI does not wish to 
compete with ellisting organiza-
tions, but simply to create a more 
pennanent relationship between fac-
ulty and student with weekly lun-
cheons. 

In keeping with its mission, the 
first meeting sponsored by FSSI 
was held on Jan. 10, with open 
invitations to faculty, students and 
staff. 

Giangreco said. "The whole 
point of the organization is to create 
a casual envirorunent where faculty 
can learn about the students and 

v ice versa." 
"TIle ultimate goal of the pro-

gr.un," said Green, "would be to 
provide a forum for meaningful in-
teraction among students and fac-
ully." 

According 10 both Giangrecoand 
Green. the organization currently 
serves primarily biomedical and 
science majors and faculty, but if 
the fonnat proves successful Ihey 
will seek to expand into olher sub-
jecl areas. 

Green added that the organiza-
lion is also usingadministnuive sup-
port to improve faculty panicipa-
tion because the administration can 
motivate faculty members. 

Faculty participation is the key 
ingredient in drawing students to 
the program, and thus the key ingre-
dient for the program's success, 
Green said

COMMENTARY 

The Struggle 
Is Not Over 
• People of color 
carmot be satisfied with 
maintaining the status quo 
Iyca.,. ...... 

St6ff~ 
The beginning of Black History 

Month hasn't sparked anything new 
around here. The claim by many black 
orpni.zaIiom that "Black History MondI 
should be every monlh" has been a 
hope, at best. for heightened awareness 
by mass society. Many blacks are throw-
ing in the towel, believing that the 
struggle has resulted in a triumph and 
looking around to see what remnants of 
raci m remain to be overcome. 

Let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
here. 

1be concept of d~stnltd gains for 
pcopleofcolor hasoffended many white 
Americans, whose ethic of fair treat-
ment has led to screams of "reverse 
racism" - nothing more than a conve-
nient explanation for the deterioration 
that many have experienced as a result 
of the recession and other economic 
flops. People have always been easily 
manipulated, turned againse each other 
to maintain a disorganization of the 
lower classes. 

For those who don't believe in an 
extensive and successful plot to imm0-
bilize people for capital gain. let's just 
say that there is no denying that even if 
there isn't such a system, the brunt 
always falls on the poor. women and 
people of color. But whatever you think 
the reason may be. it must be remem-
bend thaI-before any major financial 
and political trickery is implemented-
while Ihings are better, overt and in-
tended racism are not things of die past . 

For example: The 91 percent fee 
increase over the last three years which 
has hit people of color hardest, decreas-
ing the number of minorities in higher 
education. and illCl'ClL'ling the numberof . 
uneducated, impoverished people in the 
workforce. 

Sure. the recession was the cause. 
and almost everyone will be hit han1 by 
the fee hike. But those who will be hit 
hardest. irrefutably, wiU be those who 
are poor and have limited access to 
proper early education, namely people 
of color. 

The racially ignorwu element of this 
issue is that while !he UC Regents ex-
hort their disinterest in CUUina enroll-
ment in order to minimize "shutting the 
door on a large number of future stu-
dents, " there is no mention about the 
long-term ramifications which will toy 
with the extermination of people of 
color and the economically disadvan-
taged. 

There will be CORSequences, includ-
ing • lack of role models in higher 
educalion forprospcctive Sludcncs. The 
adminisb'Mion, Governor W'tlson, ev-

~ryoM knows Ibis. ipoIa it and claims 
thallhere is no ocher option. 

There's a formula for the economic 
pins and Ioues in this IIIIIion, and the 
result. like throwinI the hunpy dos • 
fake bone, is a consisrent deception and 
deprivation of the impoverishedrnatleS. 
It keeps \IS saambliIJI for me ~ 
and leaves us in • perpetual &We of 
apaIhy and despair. 

People of color on Ibis campus are 
waIChina their younaer broIhen and 
sisten have the pte of opponunity 
slammed in their faces by the BrtJ/Iford 
decision. disproportion_ fPw'CiII aid

The more recent "Come See TIle Para-

many Asian men with white women? 

San Francisco State University profes-
sor and conunercial photographer Anto-
nio De Castro began work on an all-Asian 
male pin-up calendar after hearing that 
most of !he Asian women in one of his 
courses were not particularly interested in 
dating Asian men. His calendar. now in a 
very successful second year. shows virile 
and masculine men representative of the 
wide spectrum of cultures and ethnicities 
denoted by the tenn "Asian." 

Sonoma State profes or Larry 
Shinagawa and UC Berkeley's Gin Yong 
Pang have come up with the term 
hipergamy to describe the dynamic that 
drives people to choose mates that better 
their social standing. 

No less controversial is the theory that 
all this is about a backlash against femi-
ni m with white men "defecting" to Asian 
women out of a fear of white women's 
demands on them. Some people call Asian 
women with white boyfriends "twinkles" 
and white guys like me. who have an Asian 
girlfriend. "eggs" (J hope I don 't have to 
explain this). 

Are all white guys with Asian girl-
friends sleazy types who want the 
"Bangkok Sex Tour1" Are all Asian women 
with white boyfriends sell-outs? What the 
helJ is going on? I'm not even sure I know 
how this is ue can be talked out by all 
parties involved in a non-hunful way. 

There may be a beginning in admitting 
that relation hips often have an integrity of 
their own, bomeoutofhard work,negotia-
lion and compromisc. There may also. be a 
beginning in admitting that relationships 
are often a product of our racist upbringing 
and environment. 

After all. the sex tours and mail order 
bride businesses have little to do with 
Africa or Europe. It' s always Asia. Makes 
you think. doesn't it? 

So You Think You're Not a Racist? Think Again 
• MostAmericans talk the talk of equality, but very few of us walk the walk 
By 11Iorue ........ 
Cont1tMIng OpInion Writer 

Are you a racist? Or do you accept the 
premise that aU people are basically the 
same wilh the exception of their cultures? 

If you do accept chis. then it follows that 
people in South Africa In also the same as 
us. whilCund blacks included Ie is also true 
thai they In in a similar stage of racial 
levelling IL'I che American South was in che 
1950llnd '60s. 

Where is Ihia going? WeD. a Gallup poll 
IBen in the South after the Supmne Coun 
hMded down its historic niling in Brown v. 
BotII'd cf Education showed that 80 percent 
of whites were vehemently opposed to the 
coun's decision eo end racial segregarion in 
che schools. 

If we accept that we are aU basically the 
same - again, with the exception of our 
cultures-then 80 perc:enc of"us" would be 
against the Coun's apparently just decision. 

"Not me," you say, "I believe in racial 
equalityl" After all, ie's han1 to believe that 
most Americans, being the patriocs we seem 
to be, would not cake our own fundamenIaI 
principles outlined in the Declarllioo of 
IJldependence ...t che ConstiIUtion with 
absolute seriousness. The most 8ppIicabIe 
bin beins, "All men are craaed equal." 

The truIh is. however, that Jiven the 
popercin:umstlnc:es,. majority ofche lUI-

~ RoeIGunilwl 
dent body at UCSD would be willing to 
support anything from segregation to out-
right violence against a pen:eived enemy. If 
you don't believe me, p1C1L'1e examine the 
fRVailing attitudes before and after the 
Persian Gulf War regarding Iraqi immi-
grants. The student attitude fell disquietly in 
line with the govenunent' s efforts 10 detlu-
manize che enemy. 

I'm not talking about merely supponing 
the war; that in itselfis not racisc.I' m talking 
about che glee some students seemed to feel 
over che death and destruction of tens of 
thousands of people. I question whether 
thai glee would have been as inlense if we 
werekiUing CanadiansorSwedesorWhom-

ever. 
Can you look within yourself and honestly 

say that killing non-white people isn't some-
how easier to take than the killing of "more 
civilized" white people? If you cannot, and 
you see those "towel heads" as a race worthy 
of disdain or some such sentiment, then you 
are part of the 80 percent. 

You, too. would have been at the gates of 
"Ole Miss" when James Merideth tried to 
elU'OlI in thaI all-white univen;ity. You. too. 
would have been chanting merrily: "Two, 
four. six, eight. we don't want 10 desegre-
gate." You would have had the majority on 
your side. Almost everyone you knew would 
have supponed the not-so-rational reasoning 
behind segregation. 

How many of us would be willing to go 
against a vast majority on an emotional issue 
to do what we know is right and just? How 
many of us would be good Nazis and go along 
with the program? 

Most people at UCSD are not lhe ugly 
racists we see in South Africa. Most are not 
Nazis. I know that most people here do care 
about other people and are concerned about 
hwnan issues. I just want 10 emphasize that 
we. as humans. are al/ capable of shameful 
injustices. 

We must be constantly vigilant about our 
own principles and try to make sure that we 
are living our lives IL'I we say others should.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Koala Vandals Use Ethnicity to Bury Individual Responsibility 
Editor: 

Any excuse will be unaccepI-
able, for the recent vandalism IIIhc 
Koala offICe was a violenl chal-
lenge to "freedom of expression. " 
True, the Koala has been sending 
offensive messages to the UCSD 
community and might have touched 
the nerves of many readers with 
common sense; however, we must 
have more educated ways 10 fight 
against such a publication. 

The worst partofit was thecrimi-
nal ' graffiti messages, reading 
"Oticano Power" and "Oticano." 
1be question of whether it was 
OJicano persons who resorted to 
uch obnoxious acts does not de· 

serve serious attention here. With 
great possibility, this may be a racist 
plot intended to propagate the ncga-
tive image of the OJicano commu-
nity aI UCSD. 

Instead, what matters here i Ihc 
vandal ' pathetic use of ethnic iden-
tily. By the graffiti, they claimed 
responsibility as "part of some eth-
nic group," not as "individuals. "In 
other words, the vandal posed as if 
they represented "Chicanos" despite 
the fact that they are just conupl 
"individuals."

ARREST 
ConIt.ued tram .... 1 

According to die police report, 
the parking officer called for assis-
tance, and three other officers ar-
rived at die scene. One of die police 
officers began 10 question the park.-
ing officer and Waidler. 

When the police officer began 
questioning Waldler, Weir offered 
10 videotape die questioning with 
Wallher'scamera. The videotape of 
the incident shows the officer con-
senting to the taping, but asking 
Weir 10 move away. 

At first, Weir obeyed the order, 
but he said that when he realized 
that the camera was not picking up 
sound. he moved to his original 
position where the police officer 
and Walther were standing. 

"[The officer) told me to move 
back again. I told him that this was 
art and that he was in my studio," 
Weir said, 

The police officers warned Weir 
to move away severdl more limes 
before the arre t. 

On the videotape, one officer 
says to Walther, "If you want to

hoped to calch his limousine as he 
left the hotel. 

One of the marchers who also 
helped organize the event said he 
had expected more students to 
participate. 

"People are dealing with this 
individually," aid Daniel 
Finkentha1, a graduate student at 
UC Berkeley. 

''TIley have not stood up as a 
mass . .. they are inlernalizing the 
problem," he said.

dents Council representative from

play 'Candid Camera,' if you want 
to be funny ... Ijust wanlto take care 
of business." 

Another officer ordered Walther 
to "tell your friend [WeirJ to back 
up." When Weir did not, police of-
ficer Scott Garcia took the camero 
and arrested Weir. 

As the police officers escorted 
Weir into the back of their car, Weir 
shouted, "Welcome to the police 
stale ofUCSD." 

According to Weir, the police 
did not read him his rights until 40 
minutes after the arrest. 

'This was after they lried repeat-
edly to engage me in conversation," 
Weir said. 

Weir also claimed that the police 
gave him no explanation as to why 
he had to move back until after the 
arrest. 

"While I was being booked. [the 
officer) told me it was for safety 
concem ," he said. 

The case will be brought to the 
city attomey's office for review. 

"It will be the decision of the 
attomey to pursue this case crimi-
nally," Jones said. 

Theoveroll altitude of the Visual 

said the two universities are coor-
dinating their efforts to fight the 
increase. 

"'They should not be balanc-
ing the budget on the students' 
backs," Pech said. 

Alexandra Nigro. a Fifth Col-
lege first-year student, said he 
joined the march because he had 
heard her roommate talking about 
it and decided it was impol1ant 
enough to attend. 

"It's ridiculou that my par-
ents should have to give more and 
moreoftheirpaychecks," she said. 
"My parents are already gelling 
laid off. How can I get an educa-
tion?

"What I find suspect is that they 
arrested Michael, who was only 
holding the camem. Certainly, it 
was an overreaction on the pall of 
the police," said Steirunetz. 

Walther, who was not arrested 
despite the parking officer', threats, 
said thatthe legalityofthe videotap-
ing was never resolved. 

"I asked [the officer] seveml 
times, but he never said anything. 
He never explained whether it was 
legal or not," said Steinmetz. 

"I didn't understand why I wasn ' l 
allowed to document that (parking 
officer)," Walther added. 

According to Walther, he was 
involved in an incident with the 
same palting officer two days be-
fore Weir's arrest. 

The officer had put a chalk. malt 
on Walther's tires. Walther claims 
that as he wiped off the chalk malt

with people who don't want to obey 
the rules."

court next month. His attorney de-
clined to comment on the case.

"If he knew what he was do-
ing, he wouldn ' t do it," said Muir

Williams. "1 think we [should] let

bastard a conscience." 

Finkenthal said that in order to 
mobilize the UC and CSU stu -
dentssyslem-wide,thereisagmss-
roots movement developing called 
Direct Action Against the Fee In-

"Students are in a unique posi-

thing was just going in," said 
Malone. 

After struggling for much of the 
season to get her team to fi nd some 
son of groove. Malone finally gOl 
her wish. 

"This was the first game where 
everything c licked for us. 
Everybody's passes were good and 
we r.lnthe offense really well," the 
coach explained. 

Defensively, UCSD managed to 
completely neutralize Cal 
LutherJ/l's offense. 

"They r.m a lot of motion, but 
they didn't have anybody posting 
up," Malone said. 

ThaI left Beaver in the po ition 
of trying to keep up with the motion 
instead of staying in the paint. 

After a few early points were 
scored off of Beaver, Malone 
switched Young and Beaver's re-
sponsibilities, and the Regals were 
finsished. 

B-BALL 
ContInued from paCe 16 
own. Third baseman David Blum 
nailed four hits in as many tries. 
including two doubles and one RBI. 

Coach Lyle Yates was pleased to 
have the hitting and fielding which 
were never guaranteed with last 
year's Triton squad. "We're really 
happy with the tan." expressed 
Yates. entering hi 12th year at 
UCSD. "The defense did fine. 
There were a couple of problems 
that hllppenon opening day. but we 
were aggressive and turned some 
double plays," 

1M! McIlowIIIGunowr 
Erica Scholl scored nine points. 

What most impressed Malone 
was her team' drive and determi-
narion. "We had a great attitude 
goi ng into the game, everybody was 
real fired up. After the sWrters were 
on the bench, the subs kept up the 
inten ity." 

Depite the tout, Malone is ada-
mant that she did not run up the 
score. "All of our subs were playing 
as well as the starters. We tried not 
to run it up, but 1 didn'l want to stop 
them from playing with that inten-
si ty." 

While the offense rallied to score 
runs in every inning of the first 
game, the pinpoint pitchingofRyan 
Flanagan smothered the Pomona-
Pitzer hitters. The junior southpaw 
took a no-hitler into the sixth inning, 
when a Pomona batter tapped a 
check-swing looper that died along 
the third base line. 

After wnassing 17 run in the 
first game. one might have thought 
the on laught would subside. Not 
quite. En route to the 18-5 laughter 
in game two, four Tritons had three 
or more hits. All-American first 
baseman David Rex led the way 
with four hits. including a double

Volleyball Can't upset 
Top-Ranked Long Beach 
By KIrsten HeIverIon 
Staff Writer 

The Tritons took on top-ranked 
Long Beach State on Friday night. 
UCSD hung on but eventually fell 
154,15-6,14-16,15-8tothe4gers. 

"Long Beach came out with the 
line-up we expected them to have 
from our scouting report," said 
UCSD Head Coach Rod Wilde. 

Despite 10 ing the first two 
games, "The team played real teady 
and didn't give up a lot of points in 
a row," Wilde said. 

Long Beach made some ubsti-
tutions in the third game enabling 
UCSD to move in. 

After several tough blocks and 
digs the Tritons were able to win 
game three 16-14. 

UCSD came out strong in the 
fourth game taking the lead at 3· 1 
and again at 5-3. But Long Beach 

and two RBI. On the afternoon. the 
senior clean-up hitler roped ix hits 
in nine tries. 

Valdez continued hi rampage 
against opposing pitchers from the 
designated hitler , pot, adding three 
more hits to an impressive after-
noon. The freshman prospect was 
perfect in hi first five trips to the 
plate as a Triton. 

Second baseman Doran Yount 
picked up three hits while driving 
horne three run and Steve Wrenn 
chipped in with two doubles and a 
single. Lead.()ffhiuer Guy Cataldo 
also got into the action, smashing a 
solo home run whiledriving in three 

was able to Sleady itself and win the 
game, 15-8, and the match. 

The Tritons' game plan was cen-
tered around two Long Beach play-
ers, middle blockers Allan Knipe. 
an All-American, and Brent Hillard, 
a former Olympic player. 

UCSD Will able to get touche 
on the 4gers kills and digs off of 
those touche , which is what it 
needed to do in order to stay in the 
game. 

The Tritons' middle hilling was 
solid throughout the match. Tyson 
Kerr had a hitting average of .348 
and Bruce Williwns had a 0418 av-
erage. 

Another Triton standout, Mau 
Brega. contributed three solo tuff 
blocks. "Brega is recognizing ma.tch-
ups in a line-up and running them 
again when they come around again 
in the rotation:' said Wilde. 

runs. 

Triton senior fireballer Bryan 
Thomason kept the Pomona-Pitzer 
bats quiet in game two, and picked 
up the victory with his five-inning 
effort. Thomason didn ' t allow any 
earned runs, as Pomona-Pitzercapi-
talized on two Triton errors to get on 
the scoreboard. 

The Tritons have establ ished the 
offensive threat and defensive ca-
pability that were missing Ill! t year. 
1begreatest challenge could be sur-
viving their hectic game schedule. 
"Our main concern is to remain 
focused for every game," insisted 
Yate .

part of the pi ture as lhe Triton 
trounced the Bruin 89-67 to notch 
their 18th win of the season.

in 118-41 trouncing of 
Cal Lutheran 
ByG .... Wrenn 
AsSOCiate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team hasn't been playing its best 
basketball lately. 

RUMing up a 9-8 record before 
Saturday night's game against Cal 
Lutheran, the Tritons had spent much 
of the sea'iOO just trying to find thei r 
rhythm. • 

Against the Regals though, 
UCSD had the beat down. 

The Tritons shot an incredible 
56.1 percent from the field on the 
way to a 11841 thrashing of Cal 
Lutheran at the Main Gym. 

Four school records were broken 
during the slaughter. including the 
shooting percentage marie Other 
marks to fall were points in one 
game, field goals (51), and three-
point baskets (seven). 

"We ju t decided that we wanted 
to win:' said UCSD Head Coach 
Judy Malone. 

'The Tritons were able todo what-
ever they wanted to, and do it well. 

Especially important for UCSD 
wa the improvement of its strug-
gling transition game. "We really 
needed to work on pushing the ball 
up the floor," said Malone, "and 
Kathleen Alvarez was able to do it. 
TIle rest of the team did a good job 
getting up the court and filling the 
lanes." 

In addition to running the floor, 
Alvarez had 18 points for the Tri-
tons, including four of the seven 
three-point bucket . 

Cari Young led all scorers with 
21 points, while Lisa Beaver had 18. 

UCSD had two other players in 
double figures: Alison Cartwright 
with 10. and Tricia Stilwell with II

The batsmen erupted during

In the Name of Love 
The histoty of Valentine's Day has been Roman all over the place 

BY KARA SAUL , CO NTRI BU TIN G WR ITE R 

•

• s Valentine's Day 
~y approaches, thoughts run 

astray as we muddle 
through our daily routines. While 
store windows are decorated with 
little red and pink ornaments, 
tender sentiments are casually 
penned across greeting cards. 
Gracefully. two tear drops meet at 
their ends in Western society'S 
representation of love. 

Unless you have been impris-
oned in an alternate universe, you 
could probably explain why 
December 25th or July 4th are 
celebrated and who celebrates 
them. However, while many 
participate in the rituals of the day, 
few people actually know the 
reason for their actions on 
FebruaJy 14th. 

There are numerou legends 
and theories behind this day of. 
counship. One of the most widely 
accepted foundalions was laid by 
the Romans. 

On this current VaJentine·s 
Day. few people will ponder lhe 
safety of their sheep. Ironically, 

this day for lovers originated as a 
Roman festival 10 protecltheir 
flocks from being raped by 
wolves. Lupercus was one of the 
gods of ancient Rome. Not only 
did Lupercus save many a sheep 
from the clutches of wolves, but 
he was also a fenility god who 
could predict future events. 

The happiness of this god was 
vital to the survival of the Romans 
as well as to the endurance of their 
fields and animals. Sacrifices to 
Lupercus consisted of goots, dogs 
and perhaps human beings. 

Once a year, two young men 
were brought 10 the temple 
Lupercallocated on Palatine Hill. 
After having their foreheads 
drenched with the blood of the 
sacrifices, their red brows were 
washed with wool soaked in milk. 
Preceding this event, the partici-
pants bursl oUllaughing. 

During the feasl that followed, 
the priests, called Luperci. ran 
upon the walls of the city wearing 
nothing but the skins of the

he fim time I was able 10 sununon up the 
courage to give a personal valentine to a 
girl was in lhe sixth grade. ) owe il all 10 
a foreign student named Rudy whom I 

... knew briefly when he transferred to my 
school in mid-year. He and his family had moved 10 
our city after a coup had taken place in their country 
and. as members of the untitled aristocracy. lhey had 
been evacuated. 

Considering his decidedly non-American look. 
Rudy tuck out at the private school ( anended like a 
pistachio in a Tupperware of yogun. He would it 
with the guy and me at lunch bul no one made much 
of an effon to get to know him very well. 

One day as we were eating in Ihe cafeleria, my 
friend Hank caught Rudy 
gazing longingly al a girl 
named Valerie across the 
room. Valerie w a 
nincompoop but she had 
lotarted wearing make-up 
in the fourth grade. which 
earned her a certain 
prestige. She wore her 
hair curled in malilighl 
ringlets like Joanie from 
Happy Days. as was lhe 
slyle at lhal time, and il 
was said that she dated 
boys from high school. 

Hank immediately 
began singing a dirty 
limerick, inserting Rudy's 
and Valerie's names in 
Ihe appropriate places. Rudy imply miled and 
nodded his head. mildly embarrassed al having been 
caught. I was hocked. Ifl had been in hi place I 
would have denied the allegation 10 th point of 
bloodshed. 

"Hey Rudy," my friend AI then said, half sneering, 
"00 you have a harem of girl wailing for you back in 
your own country?" 

"Yes," said Rudy,lrying 10 be liked. "I have five 
wives back in my counlry." Everyone laughed al thai, 
bUI more "al him" than "with him." 

Rudy then left to go talk to Valerie's best friend, 
a toady named Bernice. 

"He ouglu go back to his own country and 
chase the girls there," Hank said. 

"Yeah," AI said bitterly. "He's jusc come here to 
uy 10 steal our women. " 

"Steal your women']" 1 said dubiously. "Whal 
women do you two have?" 

At thi • the twO 12-year-olds began enwnerating 
the dozens of grown women they had had sex with 
in the past year. 

Personally I only fanaasized abouI one woman. 
She was a girl in my class named Elbel who SIll 81 
the back of the room. She was the u1timaae under-
dog girl. She was quiCl, a brain and no one else was 

even remotely interested 
in her, the fact of which 
(considered an unex-
ploited boon as I then 
had no competition. 

My interest in her 
owed its inception to a 
conversation I had had 
with her almost a year 
before. We had been 
sealed next 10 each other 
at a school assembly 
gone awry_ It was 
supposed to be a 
screening of the movie 
The Bride ofFranhn-
stein, but ju t as the title 
appeared and the 
shouting began to die 

down. the projeclor bu led a gul. The lights were 
turned on and lhe projector savant from the eighth 
grade was summoned. 

Ethel and I began complaining 10 each other 
about what a rip it was, and in the course of this 
lively exchange it was revealed thai each of us had 

' read the book FranUnst~;n and had important 
criticisms concerning its adaptation in the original 
film. ) felt something stir in me. She had a habit of 
looking up from her reading in class and taking off 
her homed-rim glasses 10 rub her eyes. Ever since

thai conversalion ( had slolen glances at her, but had 
never actually spoken to her. 

A few weeks after the lunch-time incident. I saw 
Rudy in lhe library drawing on a piece of red 
construction paper. He was intensely involved with 
his project and didn ' t notice me at fll'Sl. 

"What' up, Rudy?" ( said, trying to hide any 
patronizing lone thai mighl jump OUI of Ole. 

" I am making a valentine," he said in an excited 
whi per. "For Valerie." Hi secrecy was pathetic. 
By this lime his crush on Valerie had supplied the 
school with its biggest joke and laughing-
!lock ince Billy Noonin' s flllher had 
lost the election for mayor. 

"00 you think she' ll like 
it?" I asked. 

Rudy nodded. 
'\ \ 
" 

" I am asking her if 
she will be my 
girlfriend." He was 
thrilled to his marrow. I 
fell miserable for him. 
The latest developmen 
in the ongoing saga -

was Valerie's offer of 
money 10 AI and some 
thug from the seventh 
grade to lay blows on 
Rudy unlil he promised 
not 10 be in love with 
her anymore. They had 
only relenled after 
somebody told them 
that Rudy' father 
belonged to some kind 
of Yakuza and would 
pro\Jably have them hit 
if they tried anything. 

"What do you think 
she's going to say?" I said. 
my voice dripping with 
cynicism. Som~body had to let 
hi", down easy. "00 you think she's 
going to say, ' Oh, I'm sorry I passed oul 
400 Xeroxes of dwlener you wrote me, I 

really love you IOO?'" 
Rudy appeared unaffected. 
"11le wOlSt she can say is no," Once again I was 

shocked, because what he said was completely true. 
Valerie could only rain on his parade 10 the extent 
thai he let her. 

On the way home from school I boughl a box of 
valentines with pictures of Snoopy and lhe Peanuts 
characters on them. Our class Valenrine's Day

taking place the following Thun>day, so) had a week 
to think up somelhing personal to write on Elhel's 
valentine. It would be something deep and meaning-
ful, head and shoulders above the Iypical "To: Mary, 
From: Billy." It would herald a new era in our lives 
- the petty walls of grammar school polilics would 
topple before u • We would engage in a relalionship 
far superior to lhose we had with others al school in 
thai ours would have a point. 

I spent the afternoon of February 13th sitting in 
the IUlChen with Ethel's valentine slaring back at me 

from the Fonnica countenop. Below lhe 
innocuous valentine' greeling and the 

picture of Linus, ( had written nothing. 
Perhaps I was making a mistake. The 

mocking faces of Hank and AI kept 
swimming into my mind. I felt 

hopeless. Led Zeppelin's 
"Kashmir" was rumbling 

loudly from my older 
brother's bedroom and 
seemed only to confirm my 
doom. 

After 45 minutes I had 
succeeded in writing, "Dear 
Elhel, I think you' re cool." 
My signalure was under-
nealh. 

The nexl day in class, 
while waiting for the pany 
preparalions~o be com-
pleled, I look my mind off 
of my own anxiely by 
observing Rudy. He 
seemed to be on cloud nine. 
Finally, the valenline 
eKchange began. I stood up 

and began making lhe rounds 
wilh my valentines as if my 

feet were made of lead. ( didn't 
have one for everybody, jusl the 

20 or so people) knew best. No one 
ever goc offended at having been passed 

up by someone who was less than a casual 
acquaintance. 

Sure enough, Rudy was soon making his 
approach on Valerie. 

Someone had brought a radio and I distinctly 
remember "Xanadu" by Olivia NeWlon-John 
playing. Rudy looked like he was about to burst. He 
goc close enough to her de k 10 talk 10 her, but Ihen 
spryly tossed his large heart- haped valenline onlo 
her pile without her seeing who it was from. He 
headed back for his own de k and suddenly I felt 
miserable again. 

There wasn'l a single valentine on Rudy's desk 
- it was completely bare. I could have kicked 
myself for not remembering to make him one but 
there was nodting to be done now. I waited for him 
to show some sign of dejection, but in fael he had 
not even noticed. He had his eyes trained on Valerie, 
waiting for her to read his valentine, and he could 
see nothing else. 

She ftnally opened il up and read it. She wrinkled 
her little nose at il then tossed il aside wilh lhe 
others. Rudy exhaled bli fully as if he had been 
holding his breath a long time and look OUI some 
tationery and began writjng on it. 

( was overwhelmed by this display of courage 
and strength. 

[ gave the rest of my valentines to Hank to pas 
out and made a beeline for Ethel's desk. She was 
silting there, beside several valenlines, engrossed in 
a wealhered paperback copy of "Charlotle's Web." 

She looked up from the book as I handed her the 
valentine and stared al me when I didn' t leave. I 
perched debonairly on the 
comer of her de k, waiting 
for her 10 read it. She 
gulped and then fumbled 
with the envelope. A look 
of terror came into her eyes 
as she read my message 
and she seemed on lhe 
verge of hyperventilalion. I 
gathered that ( had made a 
faux pas after all. I was 
about 10 leave when 
suddenly she grasped a ray 
of hope. Panting wilh 
desperation, she pointed a 
finger at me and a look of 
fervent religious glee 
spread across her face. 

"You have cooties!" she shouted. " He's got 
COOlies!" 

She forced a laugh and looked around to see if 
anyone else would join in. A hush fell over our side 
of the room. Bernice gave her a look thai spoke of 
future references to this outbursl alllhrough junior 
high, and possibly even into high school. 

I was remarkably calm. As recently as a year 
before I might have been monified, but we had 
crossed thai line where "cooties" no longer was the 
dreaded affliction it had once been. Ethel had 

violated the un poken tenel of early adolescenl 
composure and maturily. 

She ran out of the room like a cocker spaniellhat 
had been broadsided. I heard that she was then 
physically sick and ent home from school early. After 
thai came Ihe rumors Ihal her parents were going 10 
attempt home teaching. 

Several days later R\ldy was arre ted for polygamy. 
Apparently Rudy and hi family had lived in Reno, 
Nevada for a short lime before moving to our city and 
he had gone out on hi own and secretly married a 
dancer named Sparkles. Be ides Ihi he was already 
legally mamed to a young girl back in his own 
country. 

Ordinarily, Rudy's arrest would have been a quiet 
occurrence. but it was a Los Angeles squad car that 
rolled onto the playground Ihat day during recess. It 
cruised around on lhe asphalt for seveml minules. 

I was playing handball wilh AI while Rudy sal 
nearby writing an eXlensive poem 10 Valerie. By the 
time Ihe car pulled up near us it had accumulated a 
crowd of the mailer children tagging along behind it 
with joyful cries of "Mister Policeman! Mister 
Policeman!" One of Ihe policemen called 10 Rudy wilh 
a bull hom. 

"Freeze Rudy!" he said. "We can make this easy or 
we can make Ihis hard."11te other policeman was 
drawing a bead on Rudy from behind his door with a 
.44 magnum. 

Rudy' entire countenance shifted to something 
primal. Hi no trils began 10 quiver and he bolted. One 

as well. 

of the officers tackled 
him before he could get 
15 feel. Then Rudy 
seemed 10 have some 
kind of til. One side of 
his Face contorted, his 
shoulders jerked aboul, 
and his left leg jumped 
around by ilselF. The 
officer Irying 10 pin him 
on Ihe asphalt pulled out 
his stick and looked as 
if he were going to club 
Rudy like a baby seal. 
He relenled and was 
satisfied with manacling 
Rudy 's wrists and, 
surprisingly, his ankles 

11le officers silenlly carried him away to Ihe squad 
car. one holding him by an arm. Ihe olher by a leg. as 
if he were some kind of greal briefcase or toboggan. 

I approached as near to Ihe car as I dared and 
looked at Rudy through Ihe window. He slared at me 
from inside the car and now seemed 10 be Irying 10 
talk 10 me. I could see his lips moving but it was 
obvious I couldn't hear him. The car began to pull 
away. Suddenly Rudy's face screwed up and he stuck 
his tongue out at me.

sacrifICed victims. The women of the town 
wishing for children would submit their 
backs to the whips of the Lupen;i in a 
prayer for fertility. 

Although drastically different from our 
holiday of hearts and flowers. one of the 
chauvinistic feasts of Lupercalia inspired 
the match-making trndition. The names of 
all the women in town were collected so 
that each man could randomly draw from 
them. 

His chosen female would be his date for 

the feast as well as his companion for the 
subsequent year . 

When the Romans adopted Christianity, 
the feast was placed in danger. The residing 
priest were disgu ted by thi heathen 
di play of worship. Just as the Christmas 
tree was adopted in order to convert tree 
worshipers to Christianity. so was Ihe 
lottery kept by the clergy as a compromise 
to the pilgrims of Lupercu . However. lhe 
names of saint were subsliluted for the 
names of women. The men were expected 
to emulate the aint they chose.

"The naming of Valentine's Day is 
conceivably inherited from a priest named 
Valemine who defied the Roman Emperor 
Claudius in 270 A.D. 

Claudius declared marriage illegal when 
he realized that husbands made infelior 
warriors. He entertained the theory that if a 
man is thinking of the welfare of his wife 
and family, he will not properly concentrate 
on hi enemy. 

Valemine disagreed with the Emperor. 
Feeling thai to abolish marriage was 
cOOlrary to God's wishes, Valentine 
manied couples in secre\. Valentine! was 
discovered and sentenced to death for his 
disobed ience. 

While incarcerated. Valentine be-
friended his jailer's blind daughter and. 
miraculously, restored her vision. In the 
morning misl of his execution day, Valen-
line wrole u loving leHer 10 Ihe girl. Ilis 
final words to her were inscribed: ··From 
your Valenline:' TIllis Saint Valentine·s 
Day was christened in memory of a man 
who died on behalf of all lovers.
