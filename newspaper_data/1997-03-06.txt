Aztec Has 
National Mark 
NOTCHED: Competing in the first invitational of 
the year, two Tritons recorded quali fy ing marks 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Ediror 

In few sporb do arc you able to 
compete for the ovcrall success of a 
team while at the same time being 
allowed to focus on indl Vidual 
achievemcnt like you do in 
track and field. The 1997 edi-
tion of the UCSD track and 
field team has proven that it is 
capable uf excelling both in-
dividually and as a team. 
Coming off one of thei r most 

~ucce~,ful performances a~ a 
team. in which they went undcfcatcd 
while hosting three alifornia Col-
legiate AthletiC A,sociatlon teams 
last week, the frilOns traveled across 
town to thc San Dicgo State A/.tec 
Invitational. Thcse Individuals were 
given thetrfirst opportunity to record 
qualifying marks for the Division 
HI National Championships. 

With March I providmg the first 
calender opportunity to guarantee a 
trip to thc championships in 
LaCrosse, Wis. this May, UCSD 
took full advantage and had a pairof 

indt viduab put togcther qualifying 
mark,. 

In the mcn 's hammer throw, co-
captain GeoffLamhert outdistanced 
the fi eld hy nearly seven feet in 

scali ng up a return trip to the 
nationals with a lOss of 173' 
3". Senior stalwart Lisa 
Shepard put together a line 
showing de~pite competing 
with a nagging injury and 
posted qualifying mark~ in 
the triple JUIllP and her pe-
cialty the 100111 hurdles. 

Competing in primarily invita-
tional fields that included Ion-col -
legiate athlete, anLi foreign COI11 -
peti tors, the Tritons produced a nUIll-
ber of seasonal and personal hest,. 

In the men's 300001 , an event not 
run at the nalionals level , junior all -
Amcrican Gavin Klinger and senior 
Bryan Leek both ran strong early 
season times, finishing 8:41 and 
8:44, respectively. 

Another strong team event for 
the Tritons was the Illen ' s400-meter

Trolley Extension Offers 
Few Benefits to UCSD 

The Metropolitan Transit Development Board 
(MTDB ) is conside ring 1I proposal to e xtend the San 
Diego Trolley from the Old Town Transit Center to 
northern ni vers it y City and UCSD. At the earli est . the 
$350 milli on ex te nsion would beg in operation seven 10 
15 years from now. 

A recent A.S. resolution claims that the extension would 
benefit the community by reducing pollution and providing 
"an affordable method of transportation for UCSD stu-
dents, staff, faculty and community members." Both of 
these arguments are weak . Affordable means of transporta-
tion already exist in the fonn of the university 's Hillcrest 
shullie and the ci ty bus system. These are cheaper and 
much more flexible ways of geuing people from one place 
to another. The trolley. like any rail system. would require a 
huge capi tal investment in fixed infra tructure that would 
just attract students and staff that are already serviced by 
the Hillcrest shuttle or the bus system . 

The trolley 's e ffect on pollution may also be 
overblown . Considering the long time horizon of the pro-
ject. any measure of the environmental benefit must take 
severa l trends into consideration . most notably the 
advents of a lte rnative-fuel vehicles and telecoml11uting. 

The current trolley systel11 c<l nnot even cover operat-
ing ex penses, mus t less make a dent in the hundreds of 
millions that have becn invested in the required infra-
structure . Why cOfltinuc to throw good money after bad 
by building a hi g h -pri ced perk for stafr and students'?

MORE ON DEATH PENALTY

her column , he ackn()wledge~ that 
"i t is true that the dea th penalty i.,

ple who cOJllmit crimes. and who 
don' t '; trea t me humanely" or 
"gmnt my right\ ." This IS sOllle-
thing I have to li ve with . It IS 

much worse , however, when the 
right not to treat people humanely 
is east into a law and enforced by 
the judicial system. We willingly 
give the JudiCial sy<; tem a great 
power over our li ves, and we

I agree, o n the other hand , th at 
radal and economic bi as i~ not 
stri ctl y an argument aga inst the 
death penalt y, although the exis-
tence of the death penalty m a ke~ 
the argument much more com-
pelling. The bia, against minori -

Finally, I in vite tbe wnter 10

li st the countri es you admire the 
least. Notice how many countrie\ 
in the firsl li '> t have repea led Ihe 
death penalty, and how many in 
the second aggn:ss ive ly enforcc 
it.

"The Day trippers." Fi ve mCIll -

bers of a suburban New York fam ily ~add le 
down in a ~liItionwagon to investigate Ihe 
activity of one daughter 's hus-
band, Louise, whom ~ he suspects 
of commilling adultery. The movie

After discovering a dropped

room , Elila D' Amico (Hope 
Davis) seeks as~ i ~ l a nce from her parents, 
. ister and her sister's boyfri end in invc,'i-
glui ng the mallcr. 

A~ thc day progresse~, the family\ pur·

"Day trippers" fum:tions more a, a vehicle 
(pun Intended) to drive Ihe charat:ter, inlo 
cpisodit: ent:ounters with the people they 
meet on the ci ty ~t n:c t~ , a~ well ,,\ to n;·

"The Day trippers" premieres Fri ., Mar. 
28 at the Landmark Theater m Hilkre,l. 

In th i~ interview, Mottola and Davi~ dis-
cu,s the Origins of "Daytripper,:' the pro-
duction and the hcauty of a low hudge!. 
Guardian: What was the inspiration 
for the film? 

Mottola: I had had the Idca for 
"Daytripper~" a few month, car licr whltc I 
wa, dri Ving around in a t:ar with my 1l10ll1, 
dad and my brother around Chri,tll1a, lime. 
It wa, like a ll10menl where I wa~ having 

thi, kind of 'Twi li ght Zone" expcricm:e 
wuh my family, thinkmg, "Do other adult, 
have a ,Or! of weird ~cn,ation when they' n; 
wi th Iheir family, in the family car in the 
~uburbs, and feel like nothing has ehanged 
through the year~?" You still feel like 
you're treated like a IO-year-old: 

And then I started to imagine 
a sort of fictional story where 
Ihe famil y tri es to solve a crisis 
together. That was literally the 
germ of the idea: IThe story I 
take. plaee in one day, there arc 
no costume t: hanges. So it 's a 
gritt y, unromanl ie look at peo-
ple. 11 doesn't have to be beauti -
fully shot - it ~hould bc claus· 
trophobic, in the ca r with the 

fami ly. I thought , "This is the perfect low-
budgel movie." It 's all "hout c harac t ef~, it 's 
not ahout product ion va lues. I thought thi s 
was my one big ~hot , and I sat down and 
wrote it in about four weeks. 

I'm a prelty undi ,,;iplined wri ter. I lind

ALVIN AILEY 
Dance theater performs to 

sold-out crowd 
by leslie Wang 
Staff Writer 

The Alvin Ailey American 
Dance Theater, founded in 1959 by 
the late. great modern-dancc chore-
ographer Alvin Ailey, has 
grown ex poncntia lly in 
pre,tige and Innucncc. 

ow In Its 36th year. thc 
company ,till ha~ the 
power to alter the world', 
pcrception of A Illcncan 
dance and hlack cultural 

exprc~slon . 

Thc troupe has 
bccome an intcrnational succc ~. 
perform i ng for an cst i mated 18-
million people on six continents. 
The ec~tatic, amaling two-hour 

di~play left the sold-out crowd 
with ~tars in their awestrud eye~, 
making quick plans to sign up for 
dance lessons. 

The transference of mutual 
cnergies from the dancers to the 
audience was apparent from the 
heginning of the fir~t piece, "Suite 
Otis." a tribuLC to legendary soul-
man Oti~ Redding. The first bitter-
weet notc~ of Rcdding'~ "Can't 

Tum You Lopsc" immediately 
captured the hearts of all ob~ervers. 
hcginning the ha lf-hour cnactment 
of falling in lovc. out of love and 
cverything in hctween. 

TRIPPING: 
Creative license and 
improvisation 
Continued from page 9 
hegan ca~ting thc movie right 
away. I wrotc the two Icads for 
Hope IDavis l and Parker Posey. 
They were pcople I'd admired. I'd 
scen Hope on stage, and shc' d done 
a reading for another script of 
mine. I knew Parker socially and 
knew her movie work. 0 I sort of 
came up to them sheepi hly and 
gave them the sc ript and said. 
"Would you do thi s') We don'l have 
any money." 
How much input did Hope 
Davis have in terms of the 
script? 

I wrole a second draft Ihat Hope 
gave me some reall y good advice 
on. One of the things I changed wa 
thc addition of a litt le bit of a sib-
ling rivalry hctwecn the two sislers. 
Hope told me that I think what's 
nicc about it is that there isn ' t a sib-
ling riva lry. They love each other, 
they're just very different personal-
itics. She was right. That was my 
original instinct. so [ went back to 
that. so it's almost ;IS if the third 
draft was c10scr to the firs t draft. 

Davis: Therc arc some scenes in 
the film which arc slightly impro-
vised, but in a structured way. The 
fight scenes at the end. the very 
emotional Sluff thai happens at the 
end is hard to ~cript and it was hard 
for us to gel it right. So wc'd con-
sider whal we'd want it to be and 
just shoot it. We shot a bun h of 
different versions of the last . cene. 
That scene is shot with a 
hand-held camera? 

Mottola: Yeah. Aboul the lasl 
_0 mi nutes involve hand-held 
IC<lmeral. Eltcept when [E IiLal sees 

Former Ailey-member George 
Faison created "Suite Oti s'" play-

premiere of Lar 
Luhovi tch's cclectic 
modcrn piece, Cavalcade 
( 19RO). Locked into 
clinging metallic-,ilvcr 
bouysuit,. eight dancer\ 
leapt , crawled and jigged 
across the stagc as frantic 
music played, continual-
ly recharged their ener-

The choreography changed as 
the music worc on, gradually turn-
i ng from chaos to order. The last 
fcw minutes, where the dancers 
cach twirlcd long, peach-colored 
gymnastic ribbons in time wilh one 
another, created a visually stunning 
sccne. 

Alvin Ailey's acclaimed "Rev-
elations" (1960) ended the show. 
Splil into three parts that repre-
sent life, death and the beyond, 
" Revelation, " intertwined sevcn 
Iraditional black gospel melodiC, 
such as "Wade in the Water" and 
"Rocka My Soul in the BOS0111 of 
Ahraham" with the talent of 20 
dancers. creating a beautiful. soul-
fi lied hallct. 

her hu,hand dancing - I wankd 
cverythlng to stor. We shot wllh 
slightly longer lenses to 111ake 
cverythlng look prettier. Mmt of 
the ~hots arc shot very s impl ~ 
hccause of hudget reasons. 
What's the most interesting 
part of the independent film 
scene? 

To me, thc most intcrc~till g 
things arc coming oUI of the inde-
pcndent world, given that thc indc-
pendent film world is very big -
it's tough to figure out where it 
begi ns and ends. There are a lot of 
pcople working at Ihat level. There 
are a lot of people who fee l that the 
only way they can really retain 
control of what they do is to do it as 
chcaply as possi ble. That's thc way 
I fc lt. 

As soon as Ilried to rai . e more 
money people were tryi ng to get 
me to change the script or to get 
some famous person to do a 
cameo in the fi lm. I've had crazy 
sugge tions like, "I know Robert 
Mitchum. Write a scene that he 
could play." Bu t that 's not thc way 
[ work. I don' t just pu t Raben 
Mitchum in my movie hecause 
somcbody knows Roher! 
Mitc hu m. EverYlhing in the 
movie is therc for a reason. So the 
only shot I had of control over the 
material wa~ keeping il as cheap 
as possible. 

Davis: I Ihink it's a great lesson 
- you don ' t need $20 million 10 
make a film . You can makc a great 
film on your credi t cards. 

Mottola : The story has to lend 
itself to that treatment. When I was 
just start ing film school," tranger 
Than Paradise" had just camc' out. 
It was one of my favorite American 
fi lm of the last 15 years. And il

to almost any music fan . The

Though It sound~ like a pretty

Make-Up has suw.:edcd in creating

Mark Patterson/ Guardwn 
Gimme Four: (Clockwise) Pam Contini , Anne Westmoreland , Sarah Schneider and Cindy Yamasaki bring senior leadershi p to this year's team . 

"in the 

Four outstanding seniors lead UCSD into the postseason 
rCl mlhe hean of hina to the top of lhe 

Empir ' Slale Building to the coasl of 
Auslralia lOlhe doors of the Alamo, il has been 
an amazing journey for Pam omini , Anne 

Weslmoreland, Sarah Schneider and Cindy Yamasa-
ki, the Inur seni ors on the U SD women's baskelball 
team. When lhis Fah Four firsl arri ved in La Joll a. 
RIMAC was merely scrihhlings on a drawing board. 
They have grown from a group of lalented hopefub 
silling on the end of the bench lO the leaders of a leam 
ranked lhird in the Weslern Region. 

The seniors are the dri ving force behi nd 
Head Coach Judy Malone's leam. Yamasaki, 
wilh her smoolh, sharp-shlx)li ng game, makes 
Malone's motion offense ti ck. She also leads 
the team in sleals. Conlini 's name is nol among 
the.Tri ton leaders in most clilegories, bUl she 
docs the litt le lhings. If lhere is a loose ball, il 's 
a good bet Contini will be the one who comes 
up wilh it. Schneider, who could slart on almosl any 
olher leam, h,ls had lO accepl being the siXlh on lh is 
learn . She has nol only accepled lhis role, she has 
excelled in il. Her sc rappy pOSl play and ahi lily lo 
score has been essenliallO the Tri lons. Weslmoreland 
is a pure force on the blocks. She has domimlled lhe 
pOSl, playing center and power forward wilh equal 
zest. She is the go-IO player on the offensive end of 
lhe fl oor, leading the Trilons in scoring. 

Bul il all ~ t a rt ed on the dank fl oors of the Main 
Gy m, a place now harely a memory for the majorilY 
of UCSD studenls, overshadowed hy the splendor of 
RIMAC's grand blue and white. lt was a differenl 
place for Head Coach Judy Malone and company, 
and a much differenl leam. 
, Thal leam ruin d a chance for success, wilh se lf-
ish alii tudes and ego problems. The resull s of the had 
alliludes and hickering'? A dis:lppoinling 13-12 sea-
~on lhal changed Malone, the fo ur impressionable 

freshmen and the fale of UCSD women's baskelball 
forever. 

Over the offseason, Malone and Ass islanl Coach 
hri s McComic made il clear lo lheir player lhal in 

lhe upcoming year. the mosl imponant lhing would 
he the leam. They dec ided to do everYlhing they 
could lo promole chemislry. They did lillie lhings as 
well and the players nOliced. 

"One of the lhings I'll re memher mo t." Schnei-
der said. "was gelling binhday cakes. We gOl a huge 

hirthday cake every lime il was someone's 
hirthday." 

"Thal first ycar was the toughesl," Comini 
said . "The pasl couple of years we've been 
much more recepli ve lO the younger players in 
lryi ng lO creale more of a leam allilUde." 

Thal offseason was the lurning poinl. Afler 
a slrong regular season, the TrilOns had lO wail 
umi I the day the braekels were announced lO 

see if they had made illo lheir fi rsl-ever loumamenl. 
Yamas:lki rememhers the anxielY. "We were all 

just sil ting in fronl of the TV," Yamasaki said . "We 
were all wail ing, and lhen we gOl il. We got the lasl 
playoff SpOl." 

Then, the Trilons were jusl happy to be in lhe 
dance and lhey were bealen in lheir firsl-ever appear-
ance. But il was a bu ilding block, and the goal for the 
nex t season was lo gel even beller. 

In the Fah Four's junior season, lhey conlinued to 
rcinforce the conce pl of learn and once agai n lhey 
impr ved. They fini shed wilh a 19-5 record , good 
cnough lO hOSl lheir lirst-cver playoff game. Thi s 
lime around, lhey wanled more lhan jusl lo be lhere 
and lhey wo n a playoff game for the first lime in 
UCSD hi slory. BUllhey 10Sl in the second rou nd. 

Obviously, corning inlo lhis sea on the goal was 
lo dri ve deeper inlo the playoffs. The seniors took lhc 

rcin~ of the lcam, bUl lhcy knew lhal in order lo wi n,

younger players had lo he included. The seni, rs played lhi s sea-
son nearly lo perfecli on on and off the cou and lhcy gOl lhe 
des ired res ult ~ . The Trilons have never heel ra nked so highl y, 
and nevcr heen given such a hi gh ~eed in the lOurnamenl. 

And wilh lhei r dominaling viclory over Pomona-Piller in 
RIMA lasl ni ghl . lhe Trilon~ look poised lo make a run in lhe 
1997 edition of lhc posleason. 

BUl, regardl ess of how far UCSD wi ll no~ go in the poslsea-
son, Malone knows whal kind of hand she's heen dealt : "So far 
as a team goes, il 'S like ni ght and day how much lhi s leam has 
progresscd," Malone said . "(The seniors) arc exaclly what I've 
been hopi ng for my whole coaching career. TI ;y sacrifi ce every-
lhing for the good of the leam and we hav, had so much fun 
together." She's delinilely gOl four aces. •

a former volleyhall standout return -

as the head coach o f the arch-ri val 
s<.: hoo l. 

It was Tn ton Head oach Duncan 
M cFarl and who looked 10 play the 
role of homecoming king a, he returned til 
his alma mater an Diego State, a team th at 
he led a\ a playe r to it s only national c ham-
pionship in 1971 

McFarland aboserved a~ theAl.tec' ~ coach 
from 19RI -1l3, ra<.:king up over 100 w ins and 
bringing home tlm:e conse<.:utive conference 
championsh ips. 

" It 's a lillic ddTcrent (go ing hack to San 
Diego State)," M cFarland said. " I ' m no t a rea l 
nmtalgic ty pe o f guy. Mostl y it W3, j U\ t a 
match I wanted to win and a team that we 
thought we could he.lI ." 

While the Ideal ho mecoming scenario 
would have the \ tar return to State and tak e 
away a win fo r hi\ newly adopted s<.:hool , the 
I\l.tecs had other plan\ . Unfortunately l or the 
Tritons, events would not play out ex ac tl y a, 
envI\ loned. as U SO lost a tough four-ganlc 
match. 

The Tritons opened the match Ii red-up. 
looking to g i ve their tirst-year coach a W IO on 
his trip horne. The U SO offen,e looked 
nearly unstoppahil: in the first game, a~ It 

Pro/ EN&INEER('!)

With the T ritons running at full speed. the 
Al.tec~ w uldn ' t come up w ith a re~ rxll1 se.

Stale and th e Altec frontl ine made

the \e(;() nd game, 15-9. 

Locked at one gam e apiece, the 
th ird gam e wo uld he the cruci al match 

fo r hoth , quad,. The A/tees <.:a me out fa, t 
and jumped ahead to take a see min gly 111 -

their first match o f the scaMlIl . 

At the bOllo m o f the fifth on Tuesday, 
the C SD hardballer, were tryi ng to put

the c() nte~t . a pl ay like thi s could be th e 
, tarun g POlOt lo r a T m on comeback. Alas, 
less than 10 feet f ro m th e fence, the Eagl e

It was that kind o f day Tue~day fo r 
Trit on Head Coach Rohert Fletcher and 
w mpany; nothin g w orked in a tough 14-4

roug hed up John Willi s 
fo r four run s in the first 
inning and ano th er in th e 
second . 

The Triton hitt er s o ffered lillie support 
to their beleaguered hurlers. In their last 
tw o ga m e" the Trit o ns have bee n 
out s<.:O red 18-4. 

"Our o ffense rea lly hasn' t been there 
th e l as t two or three games," Fletcher 
,a id. " W e've got ~() me guys who can hit

offcn' i ve ly. but w e have to exec ute and 
do the I i II Ie things. and if we do n ' t do that 
II 'S going to he ro ug h for us." 

Thi s wa, another bump in th e road for 
thi s team that is ra pidly toughening up. 
They have pl ayed through so me diffi cult 
contest, carlyon in the season. hut their 
inconsistency should pass as th e season

Sagehens are Sent Packing 
SECOND ROUND: The women moved on to the next phase of postsea on with a 74-50 victory over Pomona-Pitzer la ·t night 

By Travis Hill 
Staff Wnter 

What i~ it ahout March that cause~ 
madnes~ acros~ the nation'! In Divi -
~ion I, thi s week i~ hamplon ... hip 
Week. Allover the country, Divi -
sion 1 schools from Georgetown to 
North arolina to Fairfield to South-
west Mi~sou ri State arc fi ghting for 
automatic hid~ to the Big Dance. 

But in the Divi~ion III neck of 
the woods, thi ~ week take~ on an 
even greater importance : The Big 
Dance has already hegun, and the 
UCSD wClmen · ... ha~kethallteam is 

To the rack: Senior Cindy 
Yamasaki scores two of her 12. 

once again advanCing to the !.econd 
round after its 74-50 victory over 
Pomona-Pitzer o liege. 

For the third consecutive year, 
the Triton ... received an in-
vitation to tht: hall . Forthe 
\econd consecutive year, 
they were ranked high 
enough to play their fir~t ­
round game at home (thi., 
year they arc ranked third, 
thc highe ... t in SO hl~-
tory). I 

La~t year, the Triton~ 
... truggled again~t the agehen\ In 
the fir.,t round. In the end SD 
pulled off a one-point 5H-57 victory 
and a ticket to Minnesota to take on 

o. I ranked . t. Thoma~ . The 
Tommies easily took care ofa timid 
Triton ~quad , 66-42. The Tnton~ 

~uffered throughou t that conte~t 
from a lack of confidence; they 
played ~cared . 

Butthat attitude ha~ changed thi~ 
~eason . Head Coach Judy Malone 
and her troops are now a ~ea~oned 
group that i~ used to winning. In -

~tead of heing ~cared of ()pponent~. 
the Tritons have now come to ex -
pect a victory ever time the take 
the court . 

They played ~ome ex tremely dif -
ficult games carlyon against top-
ranked team~. including SI. Tho-
mas, ~o now the Tnton~ are ready 
for hlg-time competition. 

oming Into the game, U . 0 
had reeled off~ix con!.ecu ti ve viclO-

ric ... to end the regular ... eason. They 
then stormed mto the playoff~ With 
a Single goal : get past the se~ond 
round. With thi~ tremendous win 

they arc half-way there. 
The TnlOn~ quickly 

jumped out to a 10-4 lead 
in the early minutes of 
the game. They looked 
ready to dommate. But 
the Sagehens, who had 
beaten the Triton~ ear-
lier thi~ ~eas()n , were not 
going to give up that eas-

Ily . The Triton, coulln ' t ... hake the 
Sagehen~ and at one pOint . the tealnS 
were tied at 32. 

But the Triton ... never ... eemed to 
he worried: regardlc~ ... of what th' 
Sagehens did . they never relin -
qUI~hed control of the .game. CSD 
ended the flr~t half with a 6-0 run 
and entered the locker room leadi ng 
3 -32. 

Malone wa~ al~o confident that 
her player~ were in control and didn ' t 
make any major adJu~tment~ In the 
,econd hall . 

.. ... We did ~ay that we couldn't 
get tllnid ," Malone ~aid . "We 
couldn ' t play not to Ime. We had to 
go oUI there and contlllUl' 10 he ag-
gre~~1 ve." 

That would he thl' he~t way to 
de~<.:rIhe the Tritons ' play in the 

~econd hall , anothcr way would be
