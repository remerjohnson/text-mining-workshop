Senate Committee: 'No Confidence' 
In McElroy; Saltman Resigns Post 

Health Plan Dropped 
Reg Fee Getting Out of Required Coverage in Fall 

By Pal Domowitz 
Starr Wrher 

Next year's registration fees 
will not pay for student health 
insurance, Reg Fee Committee 
Chair Kenzie Nicoll said 
yesterday. 

"The cost of mandated 
insurance coverage would be 
too high, and services would 
have to be eliminated to 
maintain reg fees at the current 
level ," Nicoll said. "We studied 
two different plans presented 

by Student Health Service 
Director Dr. Robert Allen and 
decided the econd alternative, 
elimination of the mandatory 
plan, would be best. We decided 
to get out of the insurance 
business." 

The committee's recom -
mendation to Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage has been accepted 
and will go into effect with the 
fall quarter. Reg fees will not be 
affected, however, because of 

Pub Contract Signed; 
Will Open Next Fall 

A contract for the pub in the 
Student Center was signed 
yesterday and it appears a pub 
will open by Call quarter. 

. The signing of the contract 
culminates a two-year attempt 
to get a pub into the Student 
Center. 

Both the university and the 
yendor, Henry Goldy, who.runs 
the pub at San Diego State, are 
happy with the outcome, 
although a last minute snag in 
the negotiations threatened to 
put oCC the pub's opeing date far 
past the fall quarter target. 

Goldy and his partners 
disagreed with a clause in the 
contract that gave either party 
the right to terminate the 
81reement without reason on 90 
day. notice, The university 
refuaed to change the clause to 

include a requirement for good 
cause or to eliminate it entirely, 
and Goldy balked at signing. 

The university, along with 
the Student Center Board, was 
able to convince Goldy and his 
partners that the clause would 
not be used unfairly, and Goldy 
signed. 

Walk Selleck, one of Goldy's 
partners, said he is impressed 
with the people he has dealt 
with at the university and feels 
there "shouldn't be a problem" 
with the operation of the pub. 

The university needs a place 
where students can get 
together in a social atmosphere 
and the pub will provide that, 
said Gary Moser, newly 
installed Student Center Board 
chair. 

increased funding needs. 
The Health Service budget, 

through which in urance 
premiums previously were 
paid, also will be unaffected 
under the Allen plan , Nicoll 
said. Funds approximating the 
1978-79 insurance a llocation 
($385,000 of the $1,143 million 
health budget) will be set aside 
to provide direct payment for 
all outside outpatient services 
necessary in conjunction with 
Health Service care. 

This means that consulta-
tions, x-rays, lab tests and 
after-hours emergency care 
still will be provided, but will be 
paid for by the Health Service 
rather than Blue Cross, this 
year 's insurance carrier. 

However , use of those 
services will be strictly 
supervised, and all students 
will be required to check-in 
with the Health Services before 
seeking medical attention 
elsewhere, except in the case of 
after-hours or severe injury 
which prevents checking in. 

Not covered will be 
hospita lization, u rgery 
(except emergencies), doctor 
hospital visits, consultants in 
the hospital , ambulance 
transportation , outpatient care 
unauthorized, doctor home or 
office visits , additional 
accident benefits and preg-
nancy care. 

"Many students already are 
covered under their parents ' or 
their own private policies," 
Nicoll said. But Cor those wbo

Full Academic Senate Will Vote 
Tuesday-Same Decision Likely 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
As ociale Managing Editor 

The Academic Senate's 
Executive and Policy Com-
mittee voted 18-0 Wednesday 
night to show " no confidence" 
in the way Chancellor McElroy 
has conducted himself in office, 
a move one department 
chairman calls "tantamount to 
asking for his resignation. " 

T-he vote was spurred by the 
Chancellor'S decision Wednes-
day to ask Vice Chancellor of 
Aca demic Affairs Paul 
Saltman for his resignation, a 
move with which Saltman has 
complied. 

The committee's resolution 
says that McElroy ha shown 
"no concept of shared 
governance" and i "com-
pletely indifferent" to faculty 
concern , as demon trated by 
the way he reorganized the 
academic affair office to take 
the Dean of Graduate Studies 
and Research and place him 
under the Chancellor'S 
authority . 

The resolution, which carries 
no formal niversityauthority, 
will be voted on Tuesday at3 : 30 
in a meeting of the full 
Academic Senate. Copies of the 
resolution were sent to faculty 
members today . 

Department c hairmen will 
meet and discuss the proposal 
today . 

McElroy says that he will not 
resign his position, even if there 
is an overwhelming vote 
against him , he told The 
Guardian yesterday, a nd 
argues that the change was just 
a little thing. 

" I don ' t look at it as a major 
change," McElroy said, "and I 
thought it would be a good one. 
We've been thinking about it for 
two years. I just don't think the 
faculty understands that yet," 
McElroy said. 

Policy Committee members 
believe that McElroy has not 
consulted with them on 
important reorganization 
proposals, and Saltm an 
contends that three vice 
c hancellors (Armitage, of 
Student Affairs, Moxley of the 
Medical School and Johnson of 
Financial Management) were 
not told about the change until it 
was made. 

(John on and Armitage aide 
Ray Dye confirm Saltman ' 
point .) 

McElroy say he a kedall the 
vice chancellors before making 
the decision and that all of 
them, except Saltman, agreed 
with it. 

He defend his failure to 
con ult faculty , arguing that 
the change was purely 
admi nistrative in nature, not 
the faculty's concern . 

Saltman , who e fondne for 
research program is well 
known, had been threatening to 
resign if those programs were 
taken from his authority. 

The Senate resolution ha 
a roused considerable support 
in the fac ulty . History 
depa rtment chairm a n Alan 
Mitchell said the resolution was 
" indicative of the sentiment of 
the academic community," 
and faculty members who have

Rec Center 8allot 
Put Off Until Fall 

Questioning lack of public 
information and election 
machinery for conducting next 
week's proposed Recreation 
Center Referendum , the 
Associated Students Council 
Wednesday recommended 
postponement of the vote until 
next fall and absolved its 
elections commissioner from 
any participation. 

The referendum would ask 
students to approve a $5 per 
quarter hike in registration 
fees to fund a proposed 
$1,006,000 recreation facility 
construction. 

It will consist of a swimming 
pool with jacuzzi, racquetball 
courts, night lighting on the 
Muir Field and a jacuzzi at the 
Natatorium. 

The construction, IC ap-

proved , would be directly 
funded by a Regents ' loan to be 
repaid over 25 years at 9.5 
percent interest rate. 

The $5 per quarter per 
student fee also would provide 
maintenance and operating 
fund . 

According to voter informa-
tion, no fees would be collected 
until the facilities are ready, 
currently projected for fall 
1981. 

A summer-long delay in the 
referendum could mean a 
substantial delay in construc-
tion , possibly increasing 
construction costs,

McElr9Y'S :Ways 
Ruin Credibility 

We condemn Chancellor William McElroy's decision to 
pull research from Paul Saltman's purview without 
consulting the two groups this decision will affect most. 

This university 's character is determined by the quality 
and concern of its faculty and students. It is destructive for 
an administrator to make a major change in a campus 
sector without first soliciting the opinion and guidance of 
the campus community. 

Nevertheless, an unpleasant trend , one in which decisions 
are made about the (uture o( the university without this 
prior advice or consultation, has evidenced itself during 
McElroy's tenure. 

His most recent decision to shift authority (or research on 
campus, His request for Paul Saltman's resignation, his 
behavior during the daycare center crisis and the Third 
College naming process are all instances of how decisions 
which concern the entire university community are being 
made solely by an administrative elite led by McElroy. 
The only thing new about McElroy's latest dictates is that 

he is now ignoring the concerns of the faculty as well as the 
students. 

We do not know exactly why McElroy chose to handle the 
situation as he did , for he must have known that it would 

lonly further alienate a faculty that already (eels far 
removed from the campus decision-making processes. 
Does McElroy want the faculty to have a 70 percent attrition 
rate, too? 

** The Chancellor's credibility with the students is already 
shot and nothing can save it. He can still rescue his 
credibility with the faculty , though , by going back to the 
Academic Senate and seeking their consultation. He can 
reinstate Paul Saltman as vice chancellor of academic 
affair!! and apologize to the Senate and the UCSD 
community for making ill-considered decisions. 
If McElroy chooses not to reconsider, then an Academic 

Senate vote o( "no confidence" is inevitable and proper. 
The Chancellor should then resign. The loss to the 
university, in terms of internal coordination and quality 
and external recognition, would be too great if he were to 
continue as chancellor of a campus so opposed to his 
continued authority.

AS In Opposition 
As representatives of the 

ASUCSD , we oppose both 
Chancellor McElroy's decision 
to immediately reorganize the 
office of the Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs and the 
creation of a new Vice 
Chancellor of Research and 
Dean or Graduute Studies. The 
Chancellor's action displays a 
blatant disregard of appropiate 
. procedu re which consists of 

consultation und concurence by 
the Academic Senute. Futher-
more. such .1 ' decision must 
include student purticipution in 
order to insure the existence of 
shured governunce within the 
univers ity. 

The greatness of this 
university has not been based 
upon expediency, but upon 
trust , cooperation and 
communication throughout the

entire campus community. It is 
obvious that the impact of s uch 
a decision htl not been fully 
amilyzed, due to the haste in

therefore condemn Chcll1cellor 
McElroy mandated reorgun-

Naming Is a Shaft 
Editor: 

This has been one hell of a 
week! Fi rst of all , the article of 
Provost Watson stating that we 
were "lucky" to get to vote 
really blew my mind. From my 
impression Mr. Provost 
Watson views this whole voting 
procedure as a farce, a joke, 
something to pacify the naive 
Third College Students, or 
any/all of the above. 

I guess the sad thing about 
Provost Watson's remarks was 
not the fact that he made them, 
but that they can be backed up 
by the number 01 students that 
voted. The only reason Joe can 
or does make those statements 
is because students did not get 
up to vote. He can, and Will , say 
just about anything he pleases 
so long as people sit there and 
say, "OH." 

So you. my fine reader, may 
be asking yourself, "Whatis the 
point of this article?" The point 
of this leUer is to get you pissed 
off enough to think. Think about 
how they are screwing us over 
with the naming process. 01 
course you knew that 
Lumumba-Zapata was ahead 
of Klncln the last vote, but King 
was nonethele»11 chOllCn to be 
put on the run-off ballot. Old 
you stop and ask youl'III!lI why 

the Third College Council felt 
Lumumba-Zapata inappro-
priate? Could it be that we 
"lucky" students chose a name 
which was inappropriate in 
some unknowns' (?) eyes? 

Get the hint? We are getting 
shafted through the behind and 
we are just sitting there 
enjoying it, or at least not 
getting up and doing something 
about it. 

Now! Another gruesome and 
boring detail. There is another 
gruesome and boring vote for 
Third College next week. This is 
a yes/no vote on whether the 
students of Third like the name 
of Thi I'd College as a 
permanent name. There is one 
fine detail about this vote: if 50 
percent 01 all , mind you all , 
Third students do not vote, 
either yes/no, then a name will 
not pass. 8i. Deal you say! 
Well it is! Just like you and Ithe 
administrators are also fed up 
with beating around in the bush 
about the permanent name of 
Third. What they will probably 
do is pick a name themselves; 
WITHOUT STUDENT AP-
PROVAL! 

Get what I am saying? It 
doesn't matter whether you 
pick ye or no, it only matters 
that you as concerlN!d Third 

College students vote . If 50 
percent vote, or approximately 
833 people, this would show 
good old Joe and the rest that 
we Third College people do care 
what the @+'!$&%. name we 
get. It would show them that we 
can't be pushed around by 
administrators. 

One more thing before I leave 
you to your books. Think about 
what this yes/no means. If you 
vote yes ror Third this means 
tflat you approve of that name 
as a permanent name. If you 
vote no that means that you are 
not satisfied with Third and 
that you don 't approve of that 

nam~ as fI permanent name . 
If a no vote wins by the 50 

percent required. this naming 
process would hapvcn all over 
again. How dull huh ? Right! 
But. maybe if the naming 
process is done all over again. 
you as concerned tudents can 
get in on thut process. Maybe. 
just maybe , with a little 
backbone from the Third 
College Council and Third 
College students this process 
could be more o'pen, instead of 
being an under-the-breath 
affair. as it wus this year. 

Come on Third College. show 
some unity!

Standardized Tests Called Biased 
By DaU St. Claire' Baeon 

518ft Wriler 
UCSD should not use SAT 

SCOreti as part of the admi.lsion 
criteria for enteriq students, 
Third College Provost Joe 
Watson said Wednesday. 

Watson said the SATs are one 
of the many tests that are 
"culturally biased" against 
minorities. 

Watson's comments were 
made after a talk on 
standardized tests last 
Wednesday night I)y John 
Wei .. , director of th~ National 
Project to De-mystify the 
Established Standardized 
Tests, DE-TEST. The organi-
zation explores the history of 
standardized tests and how 
they are constructed and 
scored. 

Pub Set 
To Open 
(Co.lnlled from pale I) 

In addition to the beer and 
wine, the pub will probably 
serve hamburgers, hot and cold 
sandwiches, vegetarian 
sandwiches, salad bar, pizza 
and a series of nightly specials 
with International emphasis, 
such as spaghetti and Mexican 
or Chinese food. 

- -by Reed Alpert 

Weiss noted that the 
originators of many stan-
dardized tests and how they are 
constructed and scored. 

Weiss noted that the 
ori,inators of many stan-
dardized tests, including the 
SATs, supported the eugenic 
theory (holdln, that intermar-
ria,e between races breeds less 
intelligent individuals because 
minorities are less intelligent 
than whites. 

"We must try to surpass our 
society's racial admixture as it 
halts our progress. The US is 
not as fortunate as our racially 
pure European neighbors, " 
Weiss quoted SAT originator 
Miltt Bergrim as sayini. 

One achievement test used in 
the US until 1955 was based on 
the performance of white upper 
and middle class children, 
according to Weiss . All 
questions answered correctly 
by lower class children, 
including minorities, were 
thrown out of the test, he said. 

This test was used to track 
children into di([erent 
achievement level groups in 
elementary school, Weiss said. 
Because the children were 
categorized as "slow" at an 
early age, the damage done 
was irreparable by the time 
they reached high school and 
college levels. he said. 

The students' test results 
were free to all college and grad 
schools, so admissions officers 
relied more heavily on the 
" grossly distorted" scorE:S, 
Weiss said. 

Because the averaie student 
pays about $60 to take the tests 
(including PSAT, SAT and 
Achievement tests), they 
deserve a better testing system 
and access totheir files," Weiss 
said. 

Before 1958 students weren't 
allowed to se'e their SAT scores 
because they "weren't mature 
enough," Weiss said. 

When a student takes a 
standardized test, a file is kept 

which includes his test score, 
grade point average and other 
academic information . This 

inform~tion is given to colleges 
upon request. 

According to Weiss, the 
Educational Testing Service 
(ETS) made a majorc9mputer 
error a couple of years ago that 
affected 15 percent of their 
applicants. 

The computer inadvertently 
checked a space on the form for 
unacknowledged repeaters , 
indicating that the students had 

taken the test before but denied 
it. 

The error was caught by a 
law school dean who grew 
suspicious about the large 
number of truth offenders and 
called ETS. ETS corrected 
their error by the time most 
schools accepted thei r 
students. 

Weiss said instances like this 
could be eliminated if students 
had access to their files to 
check for such errors.

'Oysters' 1M Dynasty Distingujs~ed 
In the fall of 1977 an 

unorganized group of freshmen 
and sophomore guys from the 
Mesa Apartments walked onto 
the Muir Fi e ld for an 
intramural flag football game. 
The team ? The Rocky 
Mountain Oyster (RMO) . The 
story? An intramural " dy-

competing in four sports , 
regularly winning champion-

the years they don' t win it big. 

" We lost that very first 
football game beca u e of 
unorganizat ion , " admitted 
Doug Carman , an original 
RMO who attends Warren 
College. "We didn' t know it was 
so competitive. We didn't have 
plays or positions set up ahead 
of time. In the middle of the 
first game a we were trying to

Carman added, " We started 
practicing after th at. Since 
there wasn't anything el e to do 
here, we took to sports." 

The team got little recog-
nition early that first season, 
losing their first two games.

INTRAMURAL TEAMS OF THE WEEK 
t 

14th -All-Cal 'Intramural 
Sports Festival 

UCLA -1979' 

SLUGGOS 
GYST 

ORIGINAL 
BASKET CASES 
HIGH ROLLERS 

Every year all nine of the UC campuses unite at the 
annual AII-Cal Inlramural Sports Festival for a fast-
paced weekend of play and general merriment. This 
year's All-Cal completed another successful two-
day run at UCLA last weekend as UCSO sent 
representative teams up to Smogsville for 
competit ion in coed softball. volleyball, basketball, 
and bowling. 

Jon Rufsvold's SLUGGOS capped a four-year stay of 
mediocrity in UCSO's 1M leagues with a strong 
showing in the softball competition and an even 
better performance that night at Casey's (one of 
Westwood's better known watering holes). 
On the volteybalt front. Kevin Gunning's GYST spikers 
finally got their fertilizer together late Saturday 
afternoon against UC-Berkeley. but unfortunately 
came out on the short end of a bad case of Pauley 
Pavilion sunburn. 

Joe Kowalski ond Jeff Marks took their patented 
bitching 'n mooning act out on UCLA's poorly 
outmatched refereeing crflW, but in between 
teamed up with thetr talented lady hoopsters to 
completely dominate the basketball competitiOn. 

And In the ratchety old lanes of Ackermann Union, 
Tim Glltlgon's HIGH ROLLERS rOIled 00NCrI the 
weekend with serre classy p in action against some 
af the best bowlers In the UC system. 

All In ofl. 0 good time appeared to be hod bv all In 
this 14th fendltlon ~ the All-Coi FettIYaI. At the 
conclusion. UCSD was l81ected to holt the 1980 
Festival fQr the ftrst time In Its history.

Three Year Dy-nasty- Continues 

'Oysters' Excel in Four 1M Sports· 
(Continued from pale 5) 

Over the years the team has 
compiled a 4&-13-4 (wins-I08Ses-
ties) record in football, soccer, 
softball and water polo, making 
them one of the moat successful 
1M teams In the history 01 the 
Pl'Olram. The 1978 football 
squad had the only perfect 
record (lO-t), although the 
men's soccer team had a nearly 
perfect season in 1971 (1-0-1). 

One game that stands out in 
the playen' minds is a football 
game played last season which 
RMO won, 54-0. "I think we set 
some kind of record for the 
largest point winning margin," 
Harris remarked. "That game 
gave everyone glory. I think 

each of us scored at least once. " 
"I'd nther have a real tight 

game, thoUih," said Carman. 
Rarely has the team had any 

big arguments or dlsputes with 
o(Cicials. "We've only had ref 
problems one or two times. Our 
competitiveness sometimes 
gets us in trouble," Harris said. 

"Usually we just make 
friends with the refs and they 
remember us. The majority of 
them are impartial and very 
even tempered, especially in 
football ," he added. 

How did the name, Rocky 
Mountain Oysters come to be? 
" It was my high school'S team 
name back in Colorado," 
Carmen explained. "It's also 

the name of a delicacy ." 
Both Harris and Carman 

agreed that it is ,. fun to keep the 
same name and team , with the 
same people playing every 
year. We all like to get 
together," Harris commented. 
"We don't get to see each other 
that much. It 's a good 
distraction from school ... 

Since they've been together 
for three years the team has 
gradually earned a name for 
itself in intramural circles . 

" People either come out and 
root for us because they 've 
heard of the Rocky Mountain 
Oysters," Harris remarked. 
"or they want to bump us off

because they've heard we' re 
good." 

Imposters hav.e made 
attempts to use the RMO name. 
but their errorts have been in 
vai n. An I M volleyball team 
tried to use the RMO name this 
year. "They got killed," Harris 
laughed. "They used the name 
but none of us were on the 
team." 

"Once you make a name for 
yourself it's easier to get 
noticed. You're usually ranked 
higher (in the 1M department 
ratings) if they know you." 

The team may branch out 
into more sports in the coming 
year, probably with teams in 
football , floor hockey , 

Hawaiian football , soccer. 
water polo and softball. 

Currently RMO has team$ 
competing in men's softball 
and coed innertube water polo. 
Ron Neef and Joe Davis. along 
with Carman and Harris. are 
RMO mainstays on the water 
polo team. 

Harris and Carman are on 
" five year plans" and both 
gua rantee that the RMO's will 
be around for two more years. 

After that, unless somebody 
keeps the name alive, the 
Rocky Mountain Oysters will 
l'robably become just another 
name in the UCSD intramural 
record books.

The construction ~ost is $1.006.000 Which will come tram a Regents' loon for that amount. has a~ interest rate of 
9.5 % and IS repaid over a 25-year period at $106.595 per year. The loon is secured by a mandatory $5/gu~rter/student fee which also provides maintenance and operating funds. Based on 10.000 students. there is 
a minimum of $43.405 per year for maintenance and operation. Additional Income comes from non-student user 
fees and rent when school is not in session (e.g .. Summer). 
All costs were re~rched by the UCSD Architects and Engineers Office and the Capital and Space 
Management Office. 

No fees will be collected until the Facilities are ready for student use. In Fall 1981. 

There are no additional use fees for registered students. 

Non-students must pay a use fee. 

The student fee will be Included in student fee scholarships and grants via Student Financial SeNlces. 

The student fee may be changed only by a direct all-student vote. 

At the ~nd at the .25-year debt retirement period. there will be a direct all-student vote to approve the fee level 
for continued maintenance and operation. 

The question will appear on the ballot as follows: 

Shall the Students of the UniverSity of California at San Diego asse5S themselves a fee of $5.00 per qU~lTler per studenl far the sole 
purpose of constructing, maintaining, and operating Student Recreation Facilities consisting of a slMimming pool , jaruzti, five 
racquetball/ handball courts, and a sh~I(rr/locker room located just north of the Warren W est Field , a jacuzzi at the Natawrium , and 
night lighting on the Muir Field, said Facilities 10 be governed by the Student Recreation Facilities Chaner? 

The size of the new pool is 25 yds X 25m. Each jacuzzi is 15' in diameter. The racquetball courts are standard size 
20' X 40'. The locker room has 100 dressing and 500 storage lockers. Solar heating and natural ventilation are 
used in the designs. 

The Facilities are run by a student committee, consisting of 6 voting rep-esentatives. one each appointed by the 
ASUCSD. the GSC. and each College CounCil, and 3 non-voting consultants. The Facilities annual budget report 
Is public and must be submitted to the ASUCSD. the GSC. each College Council, and the consultants. 

The referendum will be held May 30 and 31. Polling places will be as usual In 
the plazas near the cafeterias at Revelle, Muir, and Third, at the ,Book Store for 
Warren and the Medical School, and at the SIO Snack Bar. Copies of the 
Charter are available at EDNA, the libraries, and the dorms. This referendum 
requires a 2/3 majority vote to be enacted.

'Burnt Sienna' Makes Its Rounds 

Pam Is a loan officer at your 
University and State Employees Credit 
Union. Daily she comes face to face with 
people that share the same kinds of money 
needs you have. And daily she sees those 
problems solved quickly and conveniently. 

If you or your spouse are employed 
through UCSD you 're eligible to take 

U nlike the crumpled tube of nc r y li c ar ti s t 's pigment which leisurely 
spra wls across its (ront cover, 
Burnt Si e nna s how s n o 
indication of being tossed away 
in a wastebasket. Since April I 
of this yea r , the newest of 
UCSD's literary magazines has 
made its rounds to the campus 
bookstore, as we ll as Sa n 
Diego's three B. Da lton's, the 
Flower Hill Shopping Mall a nd 
the Unicorn bookstores. 

It was only a year ago when 
the publication was at the 
talking stage. It took a winter 

• quarter's worth of placing 
no tices in The Guardian , 
sending out calls for ma nu-
scri pts and orga nizi ng a n 
introductory meeting to reach 
its present status. To date, the 
effort has paid orr in the fo rm of 
300 sold copie .

Two or Three Years, He Says 

(Continued (rom page 1) 
six years as vice chancellor are 
condemning the Chancellor's 
action. 

Saltman says he will not 
attend the meeting Tuesday , 
and has refused to take a stand 
on whether he believes the 
Chancellor should resign. 

"It's an issue between the 
Chancellor and the Academic 
Senate - I want to stay out of 
it," Saltman says. 

McElroy says he is taking 
over as vice chancellor of 
academic affairs, and that a 
permanent vice chancellor will 
not be appointed for "quite 
some time," after an extensive 
search process. 

The reaction of UC President 
David Saxon's office has been 
confined to a short statement 
saying Saxon is "distressed" at 
the problems in the UCSD 
administration. 

The only similar action in 
recent UC history occurred at 
UC Santa Cruz, where the 
faculty rejected several 
chancellorial proposals , 
prompting the Chancellor there 
to resign. 

Why the Saltman resignation 
and Academic Senate-McElroy 
confrontation have happened 

McElroy Won't Retire Just Yet 
The Academic Senate may 

want him to leave immediately, 
but Chancellor William 
McElroy wants to "retire in two 
or three years." 

McElroy, 62, would be forced 
to retire in five years under the 
university's retirement policy. 
The mandatory age for 
retirement at UCSD is 67 for 
faculty members and high level 
administrators and 70 for staff 
personnel. 

McElroy was named Chan-
cellor of UCSD in July, 1971, 
and began his duties in 
February the following year. 

As UCSD's fourth chancellor, 
McElroy was the first to be 
appointed chancellor by the 
Regents without serving on an 
interim basis. 

At 55, McElroy was the oldest 
to take office. Herbert York 
was 40 when he began his 
chancellorship in 1961, John 
Galbraith was 48 in 1964 and 
William McGill was 46 in 1968. 

He came to the university 
after serving two and a half 
years as director of the 
National Science Foundation in 
Washington, D.C., and had for 
many years been associated 
with the Biology Department at 
Johns Hopkins University in 
Baltimore, occupying the post 
of department head since 1956. 

McElroy was born January 

22, 1917 in Rogers, Texas . He 
received his BA from Stanford 
University in 1939, his MA from 
Portland's Reed College in 1941 
and his doctorate from 
Princeton in 1943. His area of 
specialization was bacterial 
mutations and biochemical 

genetics . 
McElroy is the author of Cell 

Biology and Biochemistry and 
co-author of Modern Cell 
Biology. In addition, he has 
written over 100 articles in 
various scientific journals. 

His scientific contributions 

include the discovery that the 
process by which some 
creatures make their own 
natural light is closely related 
to the process by which all 
animals convert chemical 
energy into mechanical 
energy. 

Vice Chancellor of Administration Bud Sisco (I.) and William McElroy 

Recreation Center Vote Postponed 
(Con'inued from pale 1) 
in fact know what they are 
voting on," "personnel of the 
elections marshals is ques-
tionable" and "the present 
elections marshals charter has 
not been approved." 

A council source said the 
COneerDI with the charter and 
the lack of public information 
were paramount.

dilturbed by the lack of

minimum participation 
percentage, the source said. 

The marshals' charter was 
infonnally drawn up earlier 
this month by the three 
members of the now defunct 
marshals' board which 
oversaw January's daycare 
center referendum. 

Kenzie S. Nicoll, Jr., the 
Repstration Fee Committee 
repreHntative on that board, 
yesterday discuned the 
ctaarter and the history of the 
..... 

Nicoll exp .... lOme doubt

action would affect the election 
itself - "The Reg Fee 
Committee and the GSC could 
overrule the AS," he said. 

.. And the marshals appointed 
by those two groups could 
conduct the election as 
planned." 

He said the elections 
marshals were sUliested last 
winter by Richard Armitale, 
vice chancellor of student 
affairs, as an unbiased body for 
conducting referenda. 

The board wa. let up to 
include one reprelentative 
each from the Anociated 

Students Council, the Graduate 
Students Council and the 
Registration Fee Committee-
which budgets student service 
revenues (or both councils. 

Copies of the flee Center 
charter and referendum voter 
information have been 
available in all libraries 
including Scripps, and en 
EDNA for about two weeks. 

The GSC was expected to 
meet late Thursday to decide 
whether it will follow the 
underlraduates' lead or 10 
ahead with plans for next 
week', election. Pal o.mowt&z 

so quickly and with sucJ1 force 
is unclear , but personality 
conflict is the reason given by 
most. 

While most observers are 
" scared shitless. " as one 
secretary says. and refuse to 
discuss the upheavals in the 
administrative complex, some 
will say that there is an ongoing 
power struggle between 
McElroy and his Vice 
Chancellor of Administration, 
Bud Sisco, and Saltman . 
Observers say that Si co and 
McEI roy are trying to 
consolidate authority in their 
office. and that the two 
disagree over the publicity 
Saltman usually gets. 

" The whole thing 's a macho 
trip, " one Executive Policy 
Committee member say s. 
nothing more than two 
administrators goring each 
other. His objection, like th 
objection of his fellow 
committee members, i that 
the Academic Senate wa not 
con ulted before a " major" 
reorganization of the campus. 

Though both men deny it, the 
working relationship of the two 
has not always been good. 
a ccording to staff memoers 
who have worked with both. 
McElroy, these staff members 
say , resents the publicity 
Saltman gets as a highly visible 
member of the administration. 

Saltman agrees with the 
conflict theory , calling his 
removal " part of a power 
conscious" series of actions by 
McElroy's office . McElroy 
disagrees , saying the change 
was to facilitate administration 
control of research propo als 
<.Ind activities on campu . 

Plan Not 
ReneWed 
(Continued from page 4) 
prove to be prohibitively 
expensive, according to ieoll. 

Many people would see the 
exclusion of pregnancy eare 
coverage - which pays for both 
pregnancies which go full term 
and those which are inter-
rupted for any reason 
(miscarriage or abortion) - as 
discriminatory against women, 
Nicoll noted . 

On the other hand, there 
currently are several court 
cases brought by pro-life 
proponents against university 
subsidization of abortions. 

One possible alternative, 
both Nicoll and Armitage said. 
would be to offer more than one 
insurance plan - one with and 
one without pregnancy 
benefits. 

The additional cost of 
insurance coverage - es-
timated at $50 per quarter or 
higher by Nicoll - will 
automatically be picked up for 
all financial aid recipients. 
Armitage said, leaving only 
students older than 22 . 
ineligible for financial aid and 
not already insured as prime 
customers for the optional 
policies. 

Nicoll said he has been told 
that about 70 percent o( all 
undergraduate students are 
covered under their parents' 
policies and about 50 percent of 
all students are financial aid 
recipients. That would leave a 
fairly small percentage of 
uninsured students. 

Bids from insurance carriers 
are due by June 2, Nicoll said, 
and will be studied along with 
methods of notifying fall 
quarter students and imple-
menting the change at a 
subsequent committee
