Fourth College 
and Crowding 

by lee Burke 
Over-crowding at UCSD 

will be expanded in a new 
way next year with the 
opening of Fourth College. 
Fourth, which will begin 
admitting students next 
September, will add an 
even greater burden to our 
already strained facilities. 
As planned, the premier 
class will have between 
200-300 students. 

Acting Provost Pat leden, 
however, claims that the 
crowding will, if anything, 
be lessened by Fourth , as it 
will allow utilization of 
some smaller rooms and 
alternate facilities. 

He also predicts some 
remodeling the 
basement of Hl and some 
space in the Mandeville 
Center - that will help 
alleviate the problem of 
classroom space . He 
maintains that students 
would be accepted to the 
campus, whether at Fourth 
or at the three existing 
colleges. He also implied 
that 4th will have some 
buildings of its own by 
September, although on 
this point he did not 
elaborate. 

Dr. Leden also pointed 
out that adminstration and 
counseling will become 
even more accessible, with 
the addition of another 

Provost, College Dean, and 
office staff. 

As of yet, the essence of 
Fourth - it's curriculum -
has not been approved by 
the AcademiG: Senate, but 
that hearing is in 
November. In the mean-
time a group of Provisional 
Faculty are working 
diligently to derive a 
program (which will satisfy 
the Senate, the Executive 
Committee, and, of course, 
the " needs" of Fourth . 

When asked about the 
uniqueness of Fourth, it 's 
focus or forte, the reason 
for it's existence Dr. leden 
said, "Fourth will be a 
liberal arts College in the 
tradition of the other three 

Third, Muir and 
Revelle." 

Apparently the 
distinctions lie within the 
Academic imagination . No 
new departments will arise 
or evolve out of Fourth, 
and at present there are not 
even any faculty assigned 
(alt hough Dr . leden 
predicts that some of the 
provisional faculty may 
form strong enough 
loyalties and become 
members of Fourth .)

Muir 
Dope Policies 

by John Taylor 
Rumors can slither like snakes through a contained 

community like Muir College, and there are usually 
more variations on the theme than there are students. 

One of the latest and most widespread stories had 
the Muir Resident Dean 's Office purposely setting off 
the local fire alarm in the Apartments. This clever move 
supposedly gave Resident Dean Cleo Malone an 
excuse to storm into one of the rooms, under the 
pretext of clearing the hall, and to grab an enormous 
stash from under the noses of a bunch of bleary-eyed 
partiers. . 

And then (this part set off waves of drug-fed hysteria 
at Saturday night's parties), " He only copped two bags 
of tea, man ." 

Malone, along with Assista ... t Resident Dean Babs 
Baker, spoke with ·the Triton Times on Wednesday . 
They flatly denied having set the a.'a~~, for ~wo 
reasons, aside from obvious moral prohibitions against 
doing things like that : first~ use of the alarm system f~r 

Muir Town Council 
Meeting Held 

anything other than fires IS a felony; and second, If 
Malone wanted to bust up a party, he'd just go ahead 
and bust it up. 

The rest of our hot story, the tea part, collapsed 
when Malone pulled a baggie containin g about an 
ounce of dope from his desk drawer. 

The Muir College Town 
Council decided Tuesday 
to regularly hold meetings 
every other week and to 
encourage Muir students 
to attend the meetings. 

The Town Council's next 
meeting will be Thursday, 
Oct. 11, in the Muir 
Apartment lounge at 4:30, 
when the proposed 
shopping • center 
development near 15 and 
Genesee Ave. will be 
discussed. 

The Town Council's next 
meeting will be ThursdaY', 
Oct. 11, in the Muir 
Apartment lounge at 4:30, 
when the proposed 
shoppi ng center 
development near 15 and 
Genesee Ave. will be 
discussed. 

About 30 students 
attended Tuesday's 
meeting. 

The first order of 
business was deciding who 
would fill the remaining 
vacancies on campus 
committees. Students who 
wanted to be on a 
committee signed a list, 
which will be posted at the 
Student's Educational 
Change and Development 
Center. 

It is still possible for 
people to join a committee 
by contacting the p ople 
whose names appear on 
the committ e Ii t. It is 
hoped thos students who 

make up a committee will 
choose from among 
themselves their 

According to the Resident Dean , when the ~Iarm ~as 
activated Friday evening, he found the party, involVing 
30 to 50 people, wandering in and out, in the course of 
ca rrying out his legal responsibility to .clear the 

to apartment buildings of human ~eings. He said that the 
door of the apartment was open (some ha.ve 
complained that he didn't knock), and that the entire 
area smelled "extensively" of dope. He then allegedly 
checked the other rooms in the apartment, after being 
offered a joint himself, and found a group o~ studen.ts 
rolling a number of the same. Thus the baggle. He did 
admit grabbing the tea on the way out. 

Malone said that the incident will force him to be 
"Iess lenient" in the future toward violators of the rule 
prohibiting drugs in the residence halls. He added that 
he does not intend to "sniff at doors", but that future 
busts might result in "persons leaving the residence 
halls permanently." Baker cited the Resident Dean 's 
Office's responsibility to upho d the rules. 

representatvie s 
committee meetings. 

In order to allow 
students to be more aware 
of the various campus 
committees, meeting times 
and minutes will be posted 
in each house of the dorms, 
according to Cleo Malone, 
resident dean. 

Students can also find 
out when a committee 
meets and what it does by 
contacting Molly in the 
Dean of Student Affairs 
Office or by contacting the 
Muir College Dean 's 
Office. 

Sometimes, campus 
committee minutes are 
posted in the Muir College 
Provots's Office. 

Election of house officers 
is currently going on in the 
resident halls, Malone told 
the meeting. Efforts will be 
made to tell students about 
the Town Council meetings 
at the house meetings. 

The function of the Town 
Council is to develop an 
alternative means of 
college government which 
is not an elitist bureacracy," 
said lincoln Cushing, one 
of the organizers of th 
Town Coun il. " It is to b a 
forum for bringing 
omething up," h told the 

me ting . 

When asked about a student's right to privacy, a 
question that has been raised in ~ome circl~s since last 
Friday, Malone said, "I recognize. th~ right,. and I 
respect it as long as people keep their pnvacy pnvate. 

"1 wo~ld never enter a room without knocking 
unless I knew for certain that extensive use or dealing 
of drugs was going on. And then I'd just be ~oing in,to 
save their asses, 'cause if The Man goes In , they re 
going to jail." He said that the circums!ances of the 
bust would determine whether or not first offenders 
would be aksed to leave the residence halls, but that 
there would be " no question " as to the fate of students 
busted for the second time. 

Malone feels that many students see Muir as A 
Haven For Doping, because of a wid Iy-quoted 
'gentleman's agreement', between th chool and th 
San Diego Police, that "we will take ca re of our own,:' 

Malone said that most people forget that th police 
can " pick up th phon" to the San Diego F d ral 
Nar otics Squad if illicit going -on w re u p ct d at 
UCSD. "The fed 's ar n 't bound by an 'gentleman 's 
agreement." And I'd rath r not a lot of p opl g t

Chile Forum 
On Tuesday, October 2, 

at 7:30 p.m. over 250 
peopie crowded into USB 
2622 to attend a forum on 
the recent military coup in 
Chile. 

Following a speech by 
U.C.l.A. political science 
professor Michael Fleet 
and a discussion period 
marred by prolonged 
bursts of rhetoric, plans for 
a series of teach-ins, 
demonstration , and 
petition drives were agreed 
upon . The purpose of the 
protests is to help bring 
about a restoration of 
political freedom and civil 
rights in Chile. 

Tl,e meeting was opened 
by a MECHA spokesman, 
who said that a nationwide 
prote st next week 
("Solidarity With Popular 
Forces in Chile Week") 
could be the basis of an 
organization to help 
restore human rights in 
Chile. Teach-ins associated 
with the national protest 
will be conducted at 
U.C.S.D. 

Professor Fleet sketched 
a history of the coup, which 
toppled Salvador Allende's 
leftist government on 
September 11 . He blamed 
the United States' 
"invisable blockade" of 
foreign aid and loans for 

the economic CrISIS that 
threw Chile into chaos, and 
hinted that the C.I.A . was 
directly involved in the 
coup itself. He noted that 
official U.S. recognition of 
the military junta came just 
six days after Allende's 
death . 

Concern was expressed 
for the thousands of 
political prisoners presently ' 
held in Santiago soccer 
stadiums, and about the 
wave of repression 
sweeping the country in 
general. All political parties 
and labor unions have 
been disbanded, and the 
Chilean congress has been 
dissolved. 

Besides organizing 
teach-ins, demonstrations, 
and petition drives, 
participants in the forum 
suggested offering political 
asylum to Chilean 
exchange students, 
picketing San Diego 
subsidiaries of I.T.T., and 
investigating ties between 
the University of California 
and Chile. 

There seemed to be 
almost unanimous 
agreement that the United 
States should rescind its 
recognition of the new 
Chilean government until 
"basic human rights" are 
restored. 

Drug Price Study 
Drug prices in pharmaCies may vary as much as 315% 

according to a recent CAlPIRG survey. 
A survey recently undertaken by the California 

Public Interest Research Group (CAlPI RG) pointed out 
enormous price differences, not only between the 
same brand name drugs at different stores, but 
between brand-name drug~ and their generic 
equivalents. 

The CAlPIRG survey was coordinated by Jim Fox, a 
recently graduated pre-law student at San Diego State 
University. Working with other volunteers F.ox 
surveyed approximately 40 percent of the pharmaCies 
in the San Diego metropolitian area (from Chula Vista 
to Del Mar, east to EI Cajon and Spring Valley) . 
Surveyors asked pharmacists to list prices of 25 drugs 
chosen from a list of the 200 mo t commonly 
prescribed drugs. Representative samples of both 
chain and in dependant pharmacists were included in 
the survey. 

Surveyors found extremely high differences between 
the lowest and highest prices for the same brand-name 
drug. The average difff>rence from lowest to highest 
price was 152% with a range of from 48-315 %. The 
average difference in price for the median brand-name 
drug versus the median generic equivalent wa 121 %. 
The range here was from 36-247%. 

Many pharmacists refused to disclose their prices to 
CAlPIRG volunteers, with independents somewhat 
more like to cooperate than chains. The reason for this 
reluctance appeared to be that some pharmacists 
unsure about breaking curren t statutes which prohibit 
anyone from advertising pre c ripton drug price . 
(These same statute - section 651.3 of the Calif. 
Business & Professions Code - also proh ibit CAlPIRG 
from releasing the price at the pharmacie which w re 
surveryed .)

O n the 
Campaign Trail 

Weaving in and out of 
traffic Sunday on the 
circula r drive leading to the 
Bali Ha i, barely dodging 
collisions, somehow 
reminded me of th e 
st range and often lonely 
trail that politicians attempt 
to follow to office. 

I thought of the sto ry 
Jerry Waldie had told me 
earlier in the day. While 
campaigning in San Diego 
in pursuit of the 
Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination, he had 
spotted an .old man si tting 
on a park bench, and had 
approached him, followed 
by his retinue of 
supporters, aides, press, 
and con fu '.ed passers-by. 
Hand ouLtr tched, the 
Congressm;,n had said, 

" I'm Jepy Waldie, I'm 
running for Governor, and 
I'd like t :> shake your 
hand ." 

Th old • lid 01 r plied 
v h mentl} , " Well, I don't 
want to sha (c yours!" 

"Why no ?" 
"B aus I'm 105 years 

old, I've nev r touch d a 
politi ian, ad! attribut 
my long lif(' 10 that fa t ." 

Sunday the ampaign 

political pro's, candidates 
for office, young activists, 
ambitious lawyers, and 
Democrat ic office holders 
gathered to hear speeches 
by Joe Alioto , Bob Moretti , 
and Jerry Waldie, three 
candidates for Governor . 

Former San Diego county 
McGovern Coo rdin ator 
Ernie Mason, Assemblymen 
Mervyn Dymally , Larry 
Kapiloff, and Waddie 
D ddah, and former South-
ern California Democrati c 
Cent ral Committee Chair-
man Larry Lawrence were 
present at the political 
happening, which some-
what melodramati ca lly 
billed itself as "A Reception 
With California's Next 
Governor ." 

After self-consciously de -
positing my proletarian VW 
in the parking lot, I entered 
Ihe reception under the 
assumed name of David 
Buchhinrl r, with a compli -
mentary Triton Tim s ticket 
that saved me the $15 price 
of admission. 

Although the bayside

Free Bridge Lessons 
Bridge lessons, taught by 

life-master bridge player 
Bob Rosenblum, are being 
offered free to all UCSD 
students. 

Bridge is an exciti ng, 
partnership card game 
which is internationally 
popular. But it is a game 
that takes practice and 
good teach ing 10 become 
proficient. 

The Br idge Club at 
UCSD, in an effort to help 
st udents, faculty and staff 
learn the game, has hired 
an expert to teach it. Each 
Sunday at 7:00 P.M. (in the 
North Dining room at 
Revelle). Bob Rosemblum 
will give free bridge 
lessons. 

Rosenblum has been 
playing bridge for over 19 
years and has amassed over 
1300 tournament points. 
(Life-master status, the 
highest ran k, comes after a 
player has arned 300 
tournament points.) H 
writes a weekly bridg 
column for the Siln Diego 
Union and is one th 
District Board of Directors 
of th American Contra t 
Bridge League. 

Last Sunday in his first 
I sson, h introduced his 
students to the basics of th 
gam, scoring, counti ng 
points in a bridge hand, 
and th no-trump bid. 
Afterwards he "play d 
through" a numb r of 
hands with all of th 

students playing the same 
hands. 

During this card-by-card 
demonstration he pointed 
out strategy and crucial 
features of the play. 

The response from the 
students was positive and 
energetic. Of the 35 
students that attended, the 
majority, 21 were co-eds. In 
fact almost a whole suite 
from Discovery, a women's 
dorm at Revelle, attended 
the lessons.

THE UNICORN THAT GOT AWAY 

" Kids," said Grandad, "did I ever tell you the true 
account of the unicorn that got away?" 

"At least 32 times," said little Johnny, as he stifled a 
yawn . 

" Tell us again," whispered Clara. Clara had 
masochistic lean ings. 

The others looked at each other with resignation and 
sighed, as Grandad got on with the story .... 

" As I was travelling through the forests on 
Umajowbi, persistent rumors made the rounds. Rumor 
had it that the dreaded two-eyed unicorn was seen in 
the surrounding hills of Kaljabi. Having never hunted 
unicorn before, I saw it as an excellent opportunity for 
sport. Besides, I could use an ice pick. I immediately 
dropped my search for the Holy Grail, assembled a 
band of native beaters and made it for the high 
country . 

Luck was not with us. Before we had reached the 
foothills, two beaters ca me down with the clap and had 
to be left behind . The others took it as an ill omen and 
left the first night at the cliffs. I was alone. 

That morning I sca led the cliffs and followed the 
unicorn's tracks to a deep box canyon, where I spent 
the night. 

The next morning I woke up to the steady gaze of the 
unicorn . As I stirred, he-" 

"Grandad, how do you know it was a 'he'?" 
demanded Cynthia, who had only heard the story 31 
times. 

" 1 know it was a he because he ripped off with my 
Playboy books," screamed Grandad. Grandad did not 
like to be interrupted. 

He continued; . 
" He fled . I jumped out of my electric sleeping bag 

an d hurriedly fixed a c repe' suzette. Kids, there's 
nothing like roughing it. 

Armed with only a .30-06 automatic, a B.A.R ., .45 
pistol, a dozen grenades, a beri-beri culture, and a 
ca rtridge belt full of dum-dums, I set out after the 
fearsome beast . I was looking for sport and was hoping 
he'd put up a good fight. 

Hedid. 
I cornered the critter in a cul-de-sac that could be 

reached only through an inpenetrable pass." 
" Tell me," said Alex, "how did you get in if the pass 

was in penetrable?" 
"Don't bother me with details," shouted Grandad, as 

he smashed the fly on Alex' s temple with his knee. 
"Anyway," said Grandad as he stonily eyed Alex's 

vivid imitation of an epileptic seizure on the floor, "the 
unicorn saw no possible way of escape from the place 
and so faced me with hooves set and tail raised . Then 
he charged." 

" Were you afraid?" asked Billy, the sissy of the 
group. 

"Not a bit," lied Grandad, as he fondly patted Billy 's 
head with his ring hand. 

"After five feet of his razor-sharp frog gig seperated 
by vertabrae, I realized the time had come for 
retaliatoryaction. As the unicorn nonchalantly enlarged 
my pore, I cocked my 12 gauge and let him have a full 
charge right between the eyes. 

Five minutes and 32 shell s'later, I had succeeded only 
in affecting severe nitrosis of the hand, and in making 
the unicorn scream with derisive laughter. You can't 
fool an experienced hunter. My partkulillfly acute 
hunter's sense told me something was wrong. 

While the beast was still rolling on the ground, 
giggling uncontrollably, I dashed off to my tent for a 
bazooka . On the way, there I was stopped by a flash of 
light directly in fron of me. After my sight returned, I 
saw a rather diminutive old man dressed in a robe and 
dunce cap. He handed me a ca rd which I read aloud: 
'Lance Mclopez, Certified Public Wizard, Johnson 
Smith Company.'" 

'" At your service," sa id the wizard, ''' for any job to 
be done, I'm the one.' 

'''Are you really a wizard?" I asked him. 
"'You would dare cast doubts upon my veracity, 

sirrah?' he screa med, starting to raise his wand. 
"No, no," I said, soothing him. All I needed was a 

grizzled wizard on my back. 'I believe youl' 
"'What 's the deal?' I sa id guardly. 
'''Cross my palm with si lver and I'll supply you with 

the sweetest little honey of a sword you'll ever see. 
It'll make checkers out of the to ushest unicorn horn . 
Guaranteed for 12 minutes or two horns, whichever 
comes first .' 

" I got the sword and turned around, steeling myself 
for th battle to come. When I saw him, the unicorn 
was talking to another wizard, who gave him an anti-
sword potion . 

It was a big day for wizards.

Marching to 
Millenium 

I y John Ghrist 
(CPS) - Guru Maharaj Ji, one of the most 

controversial and perhaps richest religious figures in 
the United States, may either be the greatest saint or 
the finest con-man in the recent history of the world. 

The 15-year-old guru was born Prem Pal Singh Rawat 
on December 10, 1957 in Haridwar, India, the youngest. 
son of the then-Perfect Master. On his father 's death 
the boy declared that the spirit of his father had bee~ 

tra~s.mitted to him. Today he is the central figure in a 
religIOUS movement that claims six million followers 
worldwide. 

At the core of the guru's teachings is the concept 
that all 'lien possess, and are bound together by, an 
innate spiritual perfection . The role of the Perfect 
Master is to reveal this perfect ion to every man. 

It is his goal to give each man an individual religious 
experience in which he is "shown his soul". According 
to the Maharaj Ji's followers, after this "direct 
experience of God", a person naturally becomes more 
peaceful and loving. The guru's advocates see a world 
based on peace and love as the direct result of hi s 
teachings. 

In order to reach this goal, Maharaj 1i (a name 
meaning "great king") is planning to hold a religious 
festival in the Astrodome, called Millenium 73, on 
November 8-9-10. It is supposed to signify the 
beginning of a thousand years of peace and harmony 
which the guru will bring to the world through his 
teachings. 

According to Jim Vuko, a public relations spokesman 
for the Perfect Master, Millenium 73 will provide the 
religious leader with "a platform to address the United 
States and the world". The main messages will be 
delivered by the guru's disciples, called "premies" 
after the guru's legal first name, on the subjects of what 
a Perfect Master is, and how he is with us now. The final 
day -of the festival, the guru himself will address the 
" World Assembly to Save Humanity" about his plans to 
"end ' suffering on a global scale" during the new 
millenium. 

The festival's publicity plans include a 50- piece band 
which will tour the states with the guru and 500 
premies later this fall. Scheduled stops are Boston, 
Philadelphia, Washington, Columbus, Indianapolis, St. 
Louis, K~nsas City, and finally Houston. In addition, 
charter flIghts to the Millenium are being organized. 

Backing Guru Maharaj Ji is a Denver-based 
organization called the Divine Light Mission (DLM). 
The DLM is the business end of the movement, 
occupying three floors of a Denver office building, 
em ploying over 150 people, controlling approximately 
$60,000 a month, and coordinating various projects and 
activities associated with the movement. Among these 
are Divine Sales, a chain of stores dealing in recycled 
goods, Divine Services, a presently small odd-job 
business, the national promotion, publication and 
trans portation centers, and the World Peace Corps, the 
guru's security force. 

Extension Scholarships 
Available

ships will be given to 
students who want to 
enroll on a non-credit basis 
in either of two classes:

Parking Citations Will 
Start Next Friday 

The last day for students 
to park on campus without 
a permit will be Friday, 
October 12. According to 
Wayne Rounds, head of 
UCSD parking services, cars 
without "5" (student) 
permits will be given 
parking citations by Parking 
Services officers after next 
Friday. 

Parking space could be a 
problem this year, says 
~ounds . "The planning 
office enrolled more 
stude nt s than were 
originally planned for and 
didn't tell us. So we had no 
plans to accomodate the 
over-enrollment," he 
explained. At present , 
Parking Services has plans 
to expand parking facilities 
at Muir and Revelle for this 
year. 

"We expect to sell about 
5500 permits for 6200 
spaces this year," Rounds 
stated. He went on, "The 
highest occupancy rate 
we've ever had at UCSD is 
92% full, and we're 
authorized by the UC 

Regents to go 20% over our 
capacity. As an example, of 
overcrowding UCLA last 
year was 61 % over their 
capacity." 

When asked about 
motorbike facilities and a 
possible overload, Rounds 
said, " We don't think we'll 
see more bikes than we had 
a year ago. Two years ago, 
we sold 150 motorcycle 
permits. Last year, that 
went down to 113 permits." 

Three types of permits 
are sold for the UCSD 
ca mpus; "A" permits for 
the faculty, "B" permits for 
the staff and graduate 
students and "5" permits 
for students . Student 
permits cost $27 and are 
available from the Central 
Cashier on the Matthews 
Campus . 

Approximately 90% of all 
violations cited are made 
by students. "Students may 
only park in student 
spaces," Rounds 
emphaSized , "not 
anywhere on campus."

brief remarks drew scat-

Speaking in his usual low 
key, undramatic manner, 
Jerry Waldie conveyed 
deep concern over what he 
called .. the Reagan Ad-
ministration's lack of 
compassion, human sensi-

tivity, and concern for 
human dignity." 

Specifically, he 
mentioned Reagan's sup-
port of the move to bring 
back "that abomination, 
the Death Penalty ," 
Reagan 's Secretary of 
Health and Welfare Earl 
Brian's theory that " the 
drama of the walk to the 
gas chamber is a deterent 
to crime," and the Govern-

is a humane way to kill 
people." Waldie called for 
a major change in the tenor ' 
of state government, 
adding that any of the

Lobby Urges Students 
to Register to Vote 

Each student who 
registers to vote today, the 
ca mpu s registration 
deadline, can add to a 
beneficial increase of 
students' collective 
political power. 

The immediate and most 
important use of such 
student influence, and the 
goal of the current campus 
registration campaign, is 
the defeat of Governor 
Reagan's Tax Initiative, 
Proposition 1 on a special 
November 6 ballot. 

Reagan's Initiative would 
put a constitutional clamp 
on all future state budgets, 
regardless of the budgetary 
needs of California citizens. 
Possibly inadequate future 
budgets could force drastic 
budgetary slashes upon 
future generations of 
Californians, and especially 
hurt the University of 
California and its students. 

Although the normally 
low and conservative 
turnout of special elections 
would make the approval 
of Proposition 1 likely, the 
same lack of general voter 
interest offers students a 
unic;ue opportunity to 
demonstrate their political 
interest and political 
strength . 

Even a small, distinct 
grou p of voters can 
determine a statewide 
election if turnout is low. 
And , since California 
students number more 
than one million, students 
can hardly be considered a 
small voting bloc . A 
determined effort by all 
students against 

Proposition 1 could single-
handedly doom the 
scheme to failure . 

But the defeat of the Tax 
Initiative by students would 
be more than a one-time 
exercise of power; it would 
in future years increase the 
respect of politicians for 
students, and the influence 
of students over the same. 

If students are perceived 
as a reliable and 
responsible bloc of voters, 
then all politicians must 
give students more 
attentions and 
consideration (or more 
simply stated " Voters 
equals power.") 

For example, in many 
local elections , 
conservative legislators 
who were almost beaten by 
student-backed candidates, 
have had to "clean up their 
act" and be more 
responsive to students. 

With crucial senatorial, 
gubernatorial and state 
legislative races approach-
ing next year, it is 
important for students to 
register today and vote en 
millsse this November 6 to 
make this principle work. 

A further boost to 
student power at the polls 
would result if students 
register at ca mpu s 
addresses. Registering at 
school make the act of 
voting easier and saves 
students the trouble of 
voting absentee . In 
addition , a heavier concen-
tration of votes in student 
areas, which results from 
registering and voting at a

Third College 

Defended 
Dear Editor Person : 

conflict and resolution in 
human relationships 
something not offered in 
books! A part · of living 
which is essential 
learning to "accentuate the 
positive and eliminate the 
negative" and floundering 
among the shades of gray .

The real question is 
whether Third College has 
value, substance in success 
of failure. Even if it should 
fail, there is worth - an 
opportunity to learn which 
comes about knowing what 
is a "losing game" as well as 
what is a "winning game." 
My hope is that the 
"doomed to failure" 
attitude does not influence 
the faculty, students, and 
administrators to withdraw 
their support . There i~ 
another viable alternative 
- SUCCESS! There exists 
an opportunity to bring 
together common goals, 
common values, common 
experiences and an 
opportunity to accept, 
appreciate, and learn from 
differences among people 
without judgments and 
comparisons! 

UFW Victory, 
By now it must be apparent to anyone who can 

read or hear, that America's farm workers have a 
raw deal. The work is very hard, the pay is 
inadequate and the housing is disgraceful. Older 
workers fall behind the younger and more 
vigorous competition, losing earning power 
when they need it most . Minimal sanitary 
conditions are often not observed, and health 
care is poor. Child labor is common, and 
inadequate education condemns the children of 
migrant families to inevitable poverty and 
exploitation. 

The only way workers can ever achieve a 
measure of economic justice is by building a 
strong union that can stand aga inst the selfish 
interests of management and consumers. The 
United Farm Workers, under the selfless and 
energetic leadership of Cesar Chavez, c an be 
such a union for the farmworkers; a union of, by 
and for farmworkers. 

The recent decision of the Teamster's Union to 
abandon its fight with UFW is an auspicious 
victory. George Meaney deserves gratitude for 
his efforts on behalf of the farmworkers . Despite 
his well-known feelings about the commie threat 
and hippie morals, he shows a true devotion to 
the needs of workers. 

But this can only be a beginning . Ultimately 
the success of a union depends on its winn ing 
the confidence and support of workers. If 
e nough workers stand together, any te mpora ry 
ha rdships will be more than offset by fu ture ga ins 
fo r a ll. But e ach of us can take a part in the 
struggl e. The Triton Times strongly endorses 
boycotts of Safeway, Gallo and othe r compani es 
that sell or use non -U FW p roduce. A united 
effort can end onc e - for -all legali zed slavery in 
America . 

Letters Policy 
Only lette rs from registered students or staff 

will be accepted. Authors should include the ir 
address and phone number. A letter under a 
pseudonym will be published only if the actual 
name accompanies it . The letter from " Arthur 
Hemphill " attacking Third College which 
appeared in our first edition was a hoax . No such 
student can be found. As a matter of fairness, a 
person should take responsibility for the 
controversial opinions and c harges that he 
makes.

Brissing 
Editor: 

I wish to take issue with 
your newspaper. Once 
again the TRITON TIMES 
has demonstrated a lack of 
tact. In the September 28 
edition (Vol. 20, No. 2) you 
ac knowledged the 
dedication of Mayer Hall 
(formally the Phy si cs-
Chemistry Building on the 
Revelle Campus). While I 
ap plaud this event, I can 't 
help but wonder where the 
bias of the TRITON TIMES 
lies. The titl e chosen for the 
ar ti ca l rea d , "Physics-
Ch emi s try Buildin g 
Christened "Mayer Hall ". 
O ne wo uld th ink that the 
Editorial Board of th is 
paper would be aware of 
th e sensitive issue of " Key 
73", and the current drive 
by many Christian sects to 
conve rt non belie ve rs. 
While I join in the spirit of 
ecumenicism, I feel it can 
be carried too far. With t he 
chosen title, the underl ying 
reli gious prejudices of th e 
TRITON TIMES s how 
th rough . I mean, really. I 
would have anticipated a 
little more understanding 
on th e part of the editors, 

and the· chosing of a more 
appropriate title, such as,

Hitching 
Rapped 

To the Editor: 
Once again , it looks like 

the Triton Times is going to 
allow its ed itorial policy to 
be so " libe ral" tha t its 
position (s) a re lost in a 
tangle of contradict ions. 

Your fir st issue of the 
new school year con tained 
a long warning aga inst 
hitchhik ing , a ppropriately 
noting the real dange rs to 
women in this si tua tio n. 

Your secon d issue 
contained an article on 
"se llin g" on eself to 
po tential rid es - thus 
can cellin g out the first 
article . The o n ly dangers 
th at the (a ppare ntly male) 
write r noted where those 
to women dri\'ers, who 
naturally are not expected 
to pick anyone up. 

Women h it c hh i k ers 
continue to get assa ul ted, 
raped, murde red - it is, in 
fa ct, th e rul e rathe r than 
the e xception , to be 
ha ssled eith e r ve rball y o r 
physically by th e men who 
'pick them up. 

It is definitely not to a 
woman's advantage, if she 
must hitchhike , to try to 

"sell" herself by acting cute 
at the side of the road. last 
year, the "Sister Sha re a 
Ride " campaign wa s 
initiated to encourage 
women drivers to pick up 
other women an 
admonition that should still 
be in effect to the women 
of the UCSD commun ity. 

The Triton Times can be 
considered a contributor to 
a se rious problem through 
its irresponSible editorial 
policy.

Irresponsibility 
Editor: 

In th e Fri day, Sept. 28 
issue of the Triton Times 
the re appeared on the 
fro nt page an article giving 
"ti ps" on how to get ri d es 
whe n hitch-h iking . . 

Since the University has 
been sendin g literature 
opposi ng hitch-hiki ng to 
parents thro ughout the 
summe r and si nce the 
Triton Times saw fit to 
re pri nt th is mate ria l in the ir 
first issue, the only 
conclusion I can draw is 
t hat this subseque n t 
appearance o f a pro-hitch-
hiki ng art icle is a gross 
abdication of edito rial 
responsibility. 

One might object that 
people who favor hitch-
hiking have a righ t to be 
heard. Indeed they do, but 
such viewpoints should be 
re legated to the editor ial 
page where it is made clear 
that the opinion expressed 

is not necessarily that of the 
editors. Since the Triton 
Times is the official news 
orga'n of th e students at th e 
University it can only be 
interpreted that the T.T.'s 
editorial board approves of 
an article when it is. printed 
on the front page, center 
column, replete with an 
ill ust ration . 

No r can it be argued that 
my request abridges the 
T.T.'s freedom of press, 
si nce I can in no way 
coerce their choice of 
materia l. I am asking (not 
de mandin g) only for a 
more responsible edi torial 
policy, at the very least one 
which is not so blatantly 
co n tradictory t hat it 
endo rses two o pposing 
viewpoints in the same 
week . 

Finall y, it can not be 
stated that by helping to 
educate hitch-hikers the 
article mentioned above 
makes hitch-hiking safer. 
This is simply because no 
one can ever know the 
intentions of the people 
who pick them up. Quite 
often the most harmless 
looking people can be the 
most dangerous perverts . 
Diana Jonas thought she 
knew the tricks last year 
and, as a result, nobody in 
our philosophy class or 
e lsewhere has seen her 
si nce, I also suppose the 
120 girls who were sexually 
assau lted here last year 
thought they could handle 
themselves too , 

Any attempt to educate 
hitch-hikers is fru itless .

We feel that there is no

We ' pointed out that hitch-
hiking can be dangerous , 
especially for women. But 
hitch ing is an important 
and convenient form of 
transportation for some 
students, and relatively safe 
for men , so we aren 't going

be dangerous too, but we

Everyman for 
Everyone 

The night was September 27, and the UCSD Theatre, 
even removing all the chairs from its theatre to provide 
room for more bodies, found itself packed to 
overflowing for the one-night showing of tne 
Intercampus Cultural Exchange's touring production of 
the Medieval morality play EVERYMAN. 

ICE 's production of EVERYMAN was the outgrowth 
of a summer theatre workshop directed by Robert 
Benedetti , a member of the faculty of UC Riverside. 

The company for this workshop was formed on the 
basis of UC-wide auditions, which put together a 
company of 13 talented drama majors from eight of the 
nine UC campuses. 

In the program, the director explains the function of 
the group; 

" Our group was formed as a workshop dedicated to 
. an exploration of the acting process and the 
possibilities of the actor and his fellows, unaided by 
technology, in the theatrical space. As such, we have 
not attempted to produce the play, EVERYMAN, but 
rather have used the text as the springboard for our 
experiments in sound, movement, dialogue structure, 
corporate characterization, si multaneous action, and 
associative transformation. 

"The Shape and substance of the medieval text 
evoked in us contemporary images which were often 
in conflict with the original; we have tried to maintain 
this tension without editorializing. 

As Jerry Grotowski put it, the performance of 
"archaic material" should occasion a "collision with 
the roots". We have tried to collide not only with the 
root existential questions raised by Everyman, but also 
with questions about the roots of theatre itself. 

"The images evoked by the riginal have been 
developed as a sequential ritual folliwing in broadest 
terms the outline of the medieval play and using many 
of its words, but responding as well to its own theatrical 
logic, what Arta\.ld called " the logic of the irrational." 
We perform it as a way of publishing the results of our 
research and hope that you will join us in a 
consideration of the questions it raises ." 

With this a a prologue, the audience received the 
performance, which presented a dramatic piece being 
used as an extension of the acting process. 

One might question the validity of actor-training 
process as a mode of performance, and indeed, in 
terms of standard theatre convention, EVERYMAN at 
times would leave its audience and story behind, as the 
theatre workshop itself unfolded before our eyes. But 
the concentration and intensity of the work that was 
placed before the hot and uncomfortable audience (it 
was one of those freak hot nights, and alas, the modest 
UCSD Theatre nas not yet gained air-conditioning) 
riveted their attention to the fantastic collage of action 
and sound emmanating from the players and their live 
musical accompaniment. 

What resulted then, was an unusually exciting 
evening in the theatre, in which the audience was 
witness to a ritual action encompassing not only a story 
of morality, as is the play's gendre, but the acting 
processes as they related to and for the piece. 

The Intercampus Cultural Committee and the eight 
University of California campuses which sponsored the 
workshop and its subsequent tour are to be 
congratulated and encouraged by a project of this 
kind . C t ' d P 10 on mue on age

As the violent San Diego sunset languishes to 
darkn~ss, Stewie, a typical Muir freshman, sticks his 
cute little blond head in the door. "What the hell's

wonder, what the hell is going on here? 

Und.aunted, he makes his way to the undeniable

Restless, Stewie seeks out entertainment of another 
sort - the plethora of all-night games: bridge in Argo 
poker in Tenaya, "Body, body, who's got the body?" af 
the Med school. And of course, he witnesses the climax 
of t~}~ week's seri.es of indiscretions, "Games people

At least summer's frustrations are being gotten over 
early this term. Alas Stewie, your time will come.

relatively friendly roommate. 

"Wanna get drunk?" asks his roommate. Drunk l Oh

experIence the distInctly unpleasant sensation which 
generally accompanies immoderate drinking. The 
intensity of the sensation grows. " Victor ...... " says 
Stewie in misery. "I'm gonna - I tbink I'm

Stewie staggers to the elevator, supporting his 
weakening body heavily on the up button . The doors 
slip silently open . There she stands: Beatrice in

Challenger Will Test "Hot S~t" Theory 
Of Pacific Island-Chain Formation 

The upcoming 33rd cruise of the five-year-old D~ep 
Sea Drilling Project will investigate the means by.whlch 
the earth gives birth to the large chainS of Islands 
stretching across the Pacific. The celebrated drill ing 
ship Glomar Challenger and a multi-national crew of 
scientists will embark from Honolulu on October 23 
and conclude at Papeete, Tahiti, 47 days later. 

The purpose of Leg 33 is to investi?at~ the idea ?! a 
" hot spot" origin of line island chainS In the PaCifiC. 
The term "hot spot" refers to the fact that some sort of 
melting anomalies exist in the Pacific where active 
volcanoes are presently being formed. At Kailauea, on 
the Island of Hawaii, for example, J.D. Dana, on the 
American Exploring Expedition of 1.849: noted t.he 
difference between what we now call hne Island chainS 
that stretch across the central and northern Pacific, and 
"island arcs" or curved chains of islands that occur near 
the borders of the ocean near continental masses. 

Much more recently it has been proposed that line 
island chains are formed by the movement of the 
entire Pacific plate over more or less fixed spots. deep 
in the Pacific mantle that somehow cause melting at 
depth and the building of great volcanoes at the 
surface. As the plate drifts away, old volcanoes are also 
moved, new ones form over the hot spot, and a chain 
of islands eventually results. 

It has also been proposed that the Pacific plate 
moved relatively northward prior to about 42 mil~ion 

years ago, and formed the Emperor Seamount cha in, 
the Line Island, the Ellici and the Gilbert and Marshall 
chains. It is thought that about this time the moveme.nt 
of the plate changed direction, forming elbows in 
these three chains, and creating the Hawaiian, 
Tuamotu, and Austral chains respectively. 

The most striking "elbow" configuration, when 
viewing a relief map of ~h.e Pacific seafloor, i.s the one 
formed in tbe North PaCifiC by the collaboration of the 
Hawaiian Island chain and the Emperor Seamount. The 
Emperor Seamount st retches southward from the 
Siberian Peninsula, and from its end the Hawaiian 
Islands abruptly depart in a southeasterly direction. 

If the " hot spots" (perhaps better call ed melting 
anomalies) are indeed fixed , and and have been over 
the last 70 million yea rs or so, then the absolute motion 
directions of all of the plates in the world coul d be 
determined . 

Leg 33 of the DSDP will concentrate on t~e 
conjunction of the Line Islan ds and the Tuamotu chain, 
and will involve drilling into the sedimentary 
"turbiditic" fans that drape like aprons around the 
individual islands of the chains. Based on this data it 
should be possible to determine whether these are in 
fact one chain which bent into an elbow shape at a. 
fixed time, or whether they are two separate "sub 
chains".

drilling the Manahiki plateau. 

Co-chief scientists for Leg 33 will be Drs. E. Dale 
Jackson of the Uni ted States Geological Survey and 
Seymour O . Schlanger of UC Riverside. Issuing a joint 
statement on the scientific objectives of the cruise, Drs. 
Schlanger and Jackson wrote : "The idea of having 
fixed melting anomalies in the Pacific is enormously 
important toward quantifying plate tectonic motions. 
Thus far, most of the investigations relating to th e 
hypothesis have been related to th e Hawaiian-Emperor 
chain. Some recent evidence suggests that volcanic 
activity along that chain is episodic, and also that the 
melting anomaly, while it moves relatively slowly with 
respect to the rate of motion of the Pacific plate, is not 
really fixed. Some data from the Austral chain suggests 
that, at times, it may even move backwards. 

"The line-Tuamotu chain has received little 
attention, largely because it lies and has lain in 
equatorial waters, and such islands as reach the surface 
are composed of living coral reefs (of the kind 
explained by Darwin ) or recent cora l sands. By having 
the capability of drilling into the ocean floor with the 
Glomar Challenger, w e ca n drill down to find the 
earliest coral debris, and thus date the islands. In 
addition, we can obtain a history of reef growth and 
erosion through the whole life of the cycle. 

"Even if w~ find that the formation of the line Islands 
has been episodic, as seen to have been the case in !he 
Hawaiian Islands, the age of the bend where the Lme 
Islands supposedly join the Tuamotus will ri gorously 
t est the idea that the whole Pacific plate changed its 
direction of motion at a single time in the past (42 
million years ago)." 

In addition to Drs. Schlanger and Jackson, the 
scient ific staff will include Dr. Edward Winterer , Dr. 
Ansis Kaneps, Mr. Eugene Boyce and Mr. Stanley 
Serock i of Scripps Institution; Drs. Harry Cook of UC 
Riverside and David Johnson of Woods Hold 
Oceanographic Institution , Institution, Massachusetts; 
Drs. Hugh Jenkyns of the University of Durham, 
England, and Malcolm Hart of the Plymouth 
Polytechnic Institute, England; Dr. Kerry R. Kelts, of the

HA's Confront Police 
The contest of the 

century it's ...... ot. What it is is 
the first (annuall) meeting 
of the lowly Muir House 
Assistants and the all 
powerful Campus police in 
a baseball game that should 
show once and for all that 
the men in blue (in this 
case the people in brown) 
are just as human, and 
make just as many fielding 
errors as you or me. 

This battle of midgets will 
take place tomorrow 
afternoon at two on the 
field behind the Revelle 
cafeteria, a n out of th e way 
place suitable to the 
importance of this 
encounter. 

The scouting reports of 
the police practice last 
Tuesday show that the law 
officers are ready and 
raring to go and show their 
prowess both on and off 
the field. 

The other side of the leaf 
shows nothing but quiet, 
which could only mean two 
things : 1. That the Muir 
HA's are so confident of 
their superiority that they 
don't believe' they need the 
practice, which will soon 
be proved wrong; or more 
plausibaly, 2. that the 
Muir HA's are sitting in 
their warm rooms 
trembling just thinking of 
the encounter.

UNTITLED 
by Mark Liska 

The question isn't so 
much as where to begin, 
but rather where to end. 
The beginning of this 
article, the initiation of a 
trend in UCSD, Triton 
Times history, isn't quite as 
important in the eyes of the 
people as the last period, 
the final clause, the dying 
gasp. 

The Sports Department 
of this publication has been 
as prominent on this 
campus as the bubonic 
plague. It seemed the only 
people who talked about 
the dynamic sports page 
were those considered 
mildly insane, touched by 
too much studying, or 
working on the staff. Time 
marches on, however, and 
as it does so it inexorably 
produces change, which to 
UCSD means people. There 
are more people in the 
bookstore in the dorms, at 
the Health Center, in the 
Intramural Program which 
produces the logical 
conclusion that more 
people then ever are on 
ca mpus. If A, then B, so 
more people on campus 
means more people 
reading sport s wh ich 
means (keep holding your 
breath I) more people 
working on the staff. To be 
exact, there are now five 
paid positions on the staff, 
compared to a mere two 
people last year. 

Rather then continue to 
befuddle your mind with 
commas, parenthesis, and 
refutable logic, the point 
might as well be made. This 
article is going to be a 
weekly (weakly?) feature 
for the remainder of the 
year, or at least for the time 
being. Subjects will be 
varied and writing style 
rather straightforward (this 
is the Sport's Department, 
not literature) and 
hopefully the jocks will be 
uniquely delighted for this 
is an everincreasing 
contingent on campus. 

The next topic of 
conversation - or boring 
reading, whatever your 
point of view - is audience 
participatiQn. This column 
is intended to tickle the 
toes and itch the ears of 
the reader to excite the 
students to react. This 
means in letter, in person 

seagull 

or in telephone. The FIRST 
c~e in point concerns the 
title ofthis column. 

A title always signifies a 
certain degree of 
permanency. In order to 
assure all skeptical readers 
of the longevity of this bab-
bling, a title is going to be 
created. The problem is 
that sports people are 
brawn, not brain and thus 
lack the gift of creativity. 
The job is going to be left 
to YOU, the creative, intel-
lectual reader, and boy do 
we have a treat for you. 
Drop your witty 
suggestions in the Triton 
Times office (preferably to 
Mark or Eric) and if yours is 
selected, you will be the 
winner. Win what? - you 
ask - simple, a bottle of 
Coke from the " all-
highest" TT coke machine. 
That's not all, along with 
that the winner receives 
the first-ever awarded 
Triton Times Sports 
Department "No-Prize". 
Remember to leave your 
suggestions with - Eric or 
Mark in the Triton Times 
office and wait and see and 
pray that your suggestion 
comes out on next Friday's 
paper. 

Seeing how the first TTSD 
No Prize w ill be awarded 
next Friday, the second one 
is' going to be awarded 
today. Tomorrow on the 
Revelle cafeteria softball 
field, a historic baseball 
game will take place. About 
2:00 you will be able to see 
the campus cops swinging 
baseball bats, Cleo Malone 
doing his version of 
running the base path and 
the responsible Muir HA's 
arguing with the police. 
The occassion is the Muir 
HA - Campus Police 
Softball game and it's your 
chance to cheer or jeer 
your favorites without 
being arrested. 

Its also your chance to 
see Judy Lower meet her 
match in albe-bodied 
police woman Lynn Grant. 
A special No-Prize is 
hereby being awarded to 
both the Muir HA's and the 
University Police for an 
admirable effort at 
communication. Bear your 
prizes well people, they 
DON'T COME EASY.

As certa in as leaves 
falling off the trees, the 
grass turning brown and 
only three months 'til 
Christmas signs, 
BASKETBALL shakes off the 
cobwebs at UCSD. The 3-
on-3 league is the 
preseason showcase for the 
wide range of talent 
(ranging from none to has 
been) that exists here. 

Any three individuals 
who can find the gym are 
eligible to play. Choose a 
captain and have him 

. attend the meeting Oct. 10, 
at 3 p.m. 

FRESHMEN, wh ile 
recognizing the risk of 
sounding patronizing, why 
not make this your first 
venture i nto UCSD 
athletics, since you 
probably missed football , 
right? 

A wide range of would-
be athletes appear on the 
courts and you never know 
who may be in town 
(Chamberlain?) 

Among the expected 
turnout will be Prof. 
Abelson and cohorts, Prof. 
Wagner and various other 
academicians. 

Badmitten fanatics 
should note that Mondays, 
from 7 t~10 p.m." thegym is 
at your disposal. All the 
meat is trucked off the 
basketball and volleyball 
courts and the birds fly. 

You don't even have to 
bring you own racket, just 
your body should suffice. 

Football signups were 
excellent this year with 45 
mens teams and 35 coed 
teams. Players should note 
that they can compete with 
only one mens and one 
coed team. 

Overall this looks like a 
good beginning to a great 
year of planned 
intra murals, so get out 
there and do your thing. "-

New Tennis 
League 

Forms for IMers 
Now for all you Billie 

Jean Kings and Bobby 
Riggs, an Intramural Tennis 
League is being formed . 

The League will be 
divided into two divisions: 
D ivision A for all 
experienced players, and 
Division B for those who 
still find it hard to get two 
backhands in a row across 
the net. Members of the 
Men 's Intercollegiate 
Varsity Team are ineligible. 
Competition will be mixed 
doubles and matches will 
be played two nights a 
week from 7:00·10:00 pm. 

Since we want to be 
consistent with the-
Intramural Depts . ' 
philosophy of meetin .• 
people, we may organize 
the competition in such a 
way that there may be an 
occasional switching of 
partners. 

So put down thos~ 
books, pick up your racke'~ 
and come to the meeting at 
4:00 pm Friday, Odober 12 
in the PE Classroom of the 
Main Gym. For tho~e 
interested but unable to 
attend, call 755-5738 for

hunters. This organization 
publishes a magazine for

normally reckon with are 
.measured in degrees Fah-
'renheit or degrees Centi-
grade. In cryogenics, the 
science of the super cold, 
the Absolute, or Kelvin, 
scale is used. Divisions on 
the Centigrade scale, but 
the zero point (-273 
degrees C or .0460 degrees 
F) is much more significant, 
physically. At zero degrees 
Kelvin, matter is perfectly 
ordered. Molecules which 
at room temperature 
behave like Manhattan 
rush hour traffic now dis-
play the regimentation of 
well-drilled troops on the 
parade ground. Some 
interesting and useful 
effects result. 

At various temperatures 
between 21 degrees K and 
three degrees K, many 
materials conduct electric-
ity without resistance. For 
th is reason such materials 
are called superconduct-
ors. (There are more than a 
thousand of them.) At 
about four degrees K, 
helium liquifies, and at 2.2 
degrees K it becomes a 
superfluid, a liquid which 
will pour through fissures 
too small to leilk gasses. 

The basis of helium 
dilution refrigeration 
invloves yet another low 
temperature phenomenon. 
At .6 degrees K, a certain 
portion of helium three 
separates from the mexture 
and floats to the surface. A 
boundary is established 
which is nearly analagous 
to the boundary between 
air and water. Hirschkoff 
uses that analogy to explain 
how helium dilution works. 

Suppose you wet your 
• finger and blow on it. You 
feel the cooling caused by 
evaporation. It turns out 
that you can make helium 
th ree "evaporate" into 
helium four by reducing 
the amount of light helium 
still present in the lower, 
heavier layer. 

To accomplish this, a 
"still" is included in the re-
frigerator design . The still 
in SHE's refrigerators act-
ually serves a dual purpose. 
Initial cooling, down to .6 
degrees K, takes place in 
the still, where the evapor-
ation of liquid helium into 
air is promoted mechan-
ically by means of a 
pressure pump. The ex-
tremely low boiling point 
of helium three means tnat 
its evaporation will have a 
tremendous cooling effect . 

Once this initial phase is 
complete, the still acts as a 
thermal pump to start the 
dilution process. The result 
is sustained temperatures 
approaching absolute zero. 

Why bother? The helium 
dilution refrigerator is a re-
search tool in a field which 
is rapidly becoming as 
important as electronics. 
Cryogenic discoveries are 
finding application in just 
about every technology 
from tra nsportation to 
cancer detection and high -
speed computers. 

"In a few years," Dr. 
Hirschkoff likes to say, 
"there'li be a SHE helium 
dilution refrigerator in 
every kitchen." 

He is joking, of course. 
But if you really want one, 
the cost of a complete 
system runs in the 
n ighborhood of 525,000.

come to UCSD, urged that 
all interested members of 
the university community

kind of game you play 
now," he said, "you will

Rosenblum's lessons." 

Price Study 
continued from page 1 

drugs. CAlPI RG vigorously supported this bill with 
letters, cables and publicity. 

Generic drugs, that is, drugs not identified by brand 
names were without exception lower priced tnan their 
brand-name equivalents . However, if a doctor 
prescribes a drug by its brand-name it is current ly 
illegal for phamarcies to substitute a cheaper generic 
equivalent (except for MediCal patients). 

Pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars 
per year on sam ples and "Iobbying" of doctors so that 
they will prescribe their drug by its brand name. Until 
recently all 50 states had laws prohibiting substitutions 
by pharmacists; however within the last few years two 
states and the District of Columbia have repealed these 
laws. The Californ ia Assembly recently passed and sent 
to the Senate AB561 , introduced by Assemblyman Joh n 
L. Burton of San Francisco, which would allow 
pharmacists to substitute in certain controlled 
ci rcumstances. 

Passage and signature of the two bills mentioned 
wo uld allow consumers more choice in shopping for 
prescription drugs . At the present time, a shopper 
wishing to purchase 100 tablets of .25 Serpasil , a 
commonly prescribed brand-name drug, may pay as 
much as $9.95 . His average price would b~ $6 .84. If he 
were to be prescr ibed Serpasil's generic equivalent, 
reserpine, his average cost would only be $2.19, less 
tha n one-third as much and the lowest price would be 
95¢! 

Thus by combination of ci rc umstan ces, one person 
might pay ten times as much as another seeking the 
sa me drug. . 

This is just one of many of the consumer interest 
projects that CAlPIRG has done in the last year. 
CAlPIRG is a reg istered student organization at UCSD 
as well as at four other university campuses in the San 
Diego area. It is a student-run organization inspired by 
the work of Ralph Nader to protect consumers. 

CAlPIRG's student executi ve board, consisting of 
me mbers from all five ca mpuses, will me t tommorrow 
at UCSD for a weekly meeting. This meeting will be 
held in the Muir fishbowl, below the Muir cafete ria, at 
10:00A.M. 

All students, faculty and staff are invited to attend 
th is meeting and learn more about CAlPIRG . One of 
the topics of discussion will be the visit of Ral ph Nader 
to Sa n Die~o Wednesday. 

Nader Will be speaking in the Mesa College Gym on 
October 10th at 8:00 P.M. His tdpic will be 
consumerism and the public's rights. Tickets can be 
pu rchased at the Urey Hall Box office. For more

for his turn to spea k. He 
looked rather menacing as 
he stood there, shifting his 
feet nervously, su rrounded 
by a stern-fa ed cl uster of 
aides .and bodyguards. 
However, his face lit up as 
he hopped onto the stage, 
strode to the mike, and 
began a fast-paced patter 
of jokes and quips reminis-
cent of h iS old mentor, 
Hubert H. Humphrey. 

He punctuated his gen-
erally conservative remarks 
with dramatic gestures, ex-
clai ming that , "ellen a 
politician is enti tl ed to the 
dignity of keeping his 
finances secret," unless

and " I'm no barefoot boy, 
but I earned what I qave." 

He warned the state's 
Democrats to maintain 
their "great sense of polit-
ica l freedom and debate" 
in the face of "monolithic 
corporate interests." 

After the speeches, I 
moved about in the crowd. 
To my dismay, I saw evi-
dence 01 "undemocratic" 
att ire (i .e. white shoes, 
sleeveless sweaters, huge 
bow ties, even a few fur 
coats), but a quick glance at 
the scattering of youthful 
and minority faces in the 
audience assured me 01 the 
democratic character of the

Dope 
continued from page 1 

The dean, again indicating his baggie, described his . 
own relationship with the authorities. "fhe first time, 
this bag goes to the police, with no name, and no 
questions asked. The second time with the same 
p opl ,the police get the dope, names, and students.'

"You might want to say in there that if I catch 
anybody pulling alarms, I'll break all his damn fingers." 

Cleo Malone, the Muir Resident Dean, was referring 
to last Friday night, when the local fire alarms in the 
Apartments were activated, causing the occupants to 
sta nd around in the quad for about half an hour. 

"Then I'll kick him out of the residence halls." He 
added that tampering with the fire alarm system is a 
fe lony, and that he would probably turn the student In 
to whomever wanted him. 

He further commented that any student who 
remains in the dormitories during future alarms might 
also be asked to find somewhere else to live.

The concept of Company theatre in a touring 
situation is one of the highest form s of educat ion in its 
broadest sense, creating th e nvi ronment for an
