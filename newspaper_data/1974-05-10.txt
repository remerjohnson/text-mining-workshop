by John H. Taylor 

Chancellor McElroy Tue day re cinded the dl ml al of DaVid Buchbinder a<, 
Triton Time Editor.in·Chief, acting on a recommendation f rom Vlce·Chamelior 
of tudent Affair George Murphy . 

. Murphy , to whom Buchbinder appealed the hance llor ' month·old deLl"lon . 
a.,d the Univ.ersity ' po ition had been " legally untenable," and lJ[ed 

mlsunder tandlOgs a to the role of legal coun eI in hi offi e , and be[\Veen hi" 
office and the UC general oun el. 

The editor's dismisal , recommended to McElroy by the UCSD Communication, 
Board last month, resulted from a furor over an April Fool 's issue of the paper ThC' 
newspaper was subsequently found to have been "consistently Insensitive" to hE' 
Interests of " people of color" at UCSD 

Buchbinder learned of his reinstatement in a 4.30 pm me tlng With Murphy on 
Tu sday " All I can say IS that I'm happy," he commented " I'm glad I fou!!ht it . 
Buchbinder said he would sue the university had his dism issal not b en rever d 

The misunderstandings, Murphy said, occured when Student AffairS ollml,1 
Raphael Levens and the UC general counsel at Berkeley acted at first to legally defpnd 
the dismissal of Buchbinder, rather than to criticize it "They thought since the 
decision was made- and we seemed determined to stick to It- they hould do 
whatever was necessary to defend it." 

In a letter to Buchbinder. McElroy said he felt there should be a distinction bet· 
ween the ditor as an editorialist and the editor as a manager, but approved \urph'y 's 
recommendation to reinstate because of the legal ambiguity Involved 

Thought Legally Viable 

Comm. Board legal counsel Mark Bookman said he had operated under thp 
assumption that the actions of the Comm Board, in recomm nding the firing of the 
editor, were legal. "Without having done any specific research , It had eem d to mE' 
that the Board acted viably, as did the Chancellor In his deciSion to uphold the 
Board's recommendation ." 

Levens, speaking to the Triton Times on Wednesday, said he had advi ed Murphv. 
following Buchbinder's dismissal , that the :"";;'001'5 pOSition was untenable the same 
day Dave DOfenson, UCSD lia on to general counsel at Berkeley told Murph he had 
reached similar conclu Ions 'Sub equent xaminatlon of the law at the request of the 
Vice-Chancellor," said Levens, "proved me correct ." 

Fo llowing submission of Leven ' research , consisting of four ca e InvolVing chool 
newspapers, and an April 26 meeting in which Dorenson recommended rein tatement 
to the Vice-Chancelor, Murphy said Buchbinder's appeal pro eeded normally 
resulting in his recommendation to the Chancellor thiS week . 

Murphy said his orjginal suggestions to the Chancellor for disml al of Buchblnopr 
wele " bad advice. Our legal homework hadn't been done well " 

During the Wednesday meeting of the Comm Board, after a ummary b Murph\ 
of the events leading to the decision to reinstate, Comm Board chairman Michael 
W eiss asked why the Chancellor "didn't look into the legalities before he made hi 
decision ." Bookman indicated a similar feeling In an Interview later that afternoon 

In response, McElroy aid, " That's why I have qualified people around me. and a 
Communications board to make considered recommendations to m "

Rudy Nominated as Fourth College Provost 
by Valerie Girard 

Lee Rudy. it has been announced, is the man who is 
now awaiting final approval of the Board of Regents 
before he assumes the position of the new Fourth 
College Provost. 

Rudy is due to arrive at UCSD next Monday. Dur ing 
most of next week, he will be acquainting himself with 
the duties of Fourth College Provost , meeti ng with Pat 
Ledden, the acting Fourth College Provost and some of 
the faculty which will be instructing at 4th next year. 

The process for the appointment of uch a position as 
provost is an involved one. A search comm ittee is 
established and they advertised in national journals in 
order that many can be considered for the job. This leads 
to a varied selection of applicants from which the 
search committee select', a late. 

The first preference is then taken to a tenure board to 
be approved as a faculty member in his department . In 
this case, Rudy was tenured as an APIS professor and 
reviewed for his scholarship and teaching abilitie . 

Next he was put before an academic review. He had 
to have the approval of Pat Ledden , acting Provost at 
4th and the Dean of Graduate School. His application 
was given to an Ad Hoc committee for approval as well 
a a budget committee. Rudy then had to be approved 
by Chancellor William McElroy. 

The final decision will come on May 15 when Rudy's 
file will be brought before the Board of Regent for final 
approval.

'iPOLI1ICS: JAMES 5010 I 

\Uard's New Theory 
los Angeles Supervisor and Democratic Cubenatorial 

Candid ,lte Baxter Ward has announced that he will 
conduct a hearing to challenge the ballistics report on 
the assasnination of Robert F. Kennedy by Sirhan 
Sirhan. 

Ward, in a personal letter to the Triton Times, is with 
los Angeles District Attorney Joe Busch who has been 
against a re-examination of the ballistics case. Ward 
said to the Triton Times that, "I am in a deep dispute 
with the District Attorney of los Angeles who is 
dedicated to maintaining the position that ~othing is 
wrong with the ballistics-and that even if there were it 
would be impossible to go into that now." ' 

The former newscaster will start the hearing May 13 
before the los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
Ward, on filing for statewide office, announced that he 
wanted to look into the assasination of Robert Kennedy 
in 1968 by Sirhan Sirhan. He believed at that t ime that 
there are some conflicts that should be resolved . Ward 
believes now that the case should be reopened im-
mediately. 

One can only speculate on the motivat ions of Ward . 
Ward has been waging an effective campaign and has ?een gaining ground. However Ward is known primarily 
In the los Angeles Area, where he had been a televis ion 
?roadcaster before becoming a los Angeles Supervisor 
In 1972. Perhaps Ward hopes to gain statewide 
recogn ition by reopening a case which strikes deep into 
hearts of California Democrats. At any rate Baxter Ward 
has brought up some interesting thought maybe 
gratuitous, points on the Kennedy Assasination. 

Supported by three prominent Criminaologists, Ward 
claims that there is some doubt as to the distance of the 

~i~tol used to shoot Kennedy, doubt as to the angle of 
firing, and doubt that the bullets which killed Robert 
Kennedy were fired from the gun which was in the 
possession of Sirhan Sirhan. 

Ward claims he does not doubt the guilt of Si rhan 
Sirhan and that he believed there was no "conspiracy". 
Ward, does say though in his letter to the Triton Times 
that, "As. a former newsman, I view part of the jssue as 
suppression . Indeed, there are interests across the 
country who have been frustrated and outraged by what 
they consider to be a complete cover-up of vital in-
formation ." 

W~rds reopening of the six year controversy will 
certainly arouse a lot of interest in both the election of 
Ca lifornia's next governor, and in the search for the 
truth in Robert Kennedy's murder in another California 
primary.

UNIVERSITY BOOKSTO-.E 

Intern Committee Finds No Bias 
by Paul Osterman III 

A committee appointed 
by the Black Students 
Union (BSU) and Vice 
Chancellor and Dean of 
Student Affairs George 
Murphy, to review 
discrimination against the 
student intern program, has 
declared in its five page 
report to the Vice Chan-
ce llo'r that there was no 
discrimination . However, 
two additional intern 
positions have been 
opened . 

According to Mark Book-
man, Director of the Intern 
Program, the committee 
members were Phil 
Raphael, Fred Henderson, 
Jim Beckley, Muir College 
Dean, and Mary Decker 
Assistant Vice Chancellor. 
Bookman said the report, 
" didn't deal with the 

matter, however it called 
upon the Vice Chancellor to 
assure affirmative action in 
appointments and em -
ployment." 

The charges, filed by BSU 
member Michael Garret, 
asserted that no minorities 
had been appointed to any 
of the positions, and the 
process of selection appear 
to have been 
discriminatory, since it was 
void of any imput from a 
minority student. 

Dean Murphy told the 
Triton Times that it was 
evident that the selection 
process did not provide a 
" result that was 
representative of the 
campus community, and in 
order to adjust that result, 
and not fire anyone in the 
process, two new positions 
were opened. Additional 
funds for the new 

positions," said Murphy, 
"wi II come from the budget 
of the ex isting program." 

The initial selection 
committee, Daryl Fanberg, 
Wendy Mackay, and Donna 
Schwarzbach from Muir 
College, and Neil Treister 
from Revelle, were ap-
pointed by TUSC . The 
committee received si~ty­
five applications and had 
eight positions to fill. 

The new committee, 
supplemented by Cheryl 
Garret, a BSU member, and 
appointed by Dean Murphy 
has begun to review all 
applicants that were not 
selected for the intern 
positions. 

Ten people were selected 
earlier this week by Daryl 
Fanberg for interviews . 
Fanberg said, " I basically 
chose three people from 
each college, but I have no 

way of knowing if any are 
minorities." 

Interviews are expected 
to be completed by Friday 
afternoon, May 10. Ac-
cording to Fanberg, "ap-
plicants will probably be 
notified by Monday af-
ternoon ." 

The two new interns wi II 
work either with Mark 
Bookman in Financial Aids 
or with Assistant Vice 
Chancellor Mary Decker fo r 
the new student handbook 

The student intern 
program at present has 
eight positions throughout 
the University. According 
to Vice Chancellor Dean 
Murphy, " the intern 
program is a way. of in-
volving the students in the 
University . The students we 
have now are really in-
volved and are finding out 
what is going on ." 

I Seleeted Shorts I 
Capitalism ala USSR \ 

(Christian Science Monitor) The Soviet Union has 
become the big gest supplier of refined gold bullion to 
the United States, according to Commerce Department 
data for the first quarter of this year . 

This is b lieved to be the first time on record that the 
USSR has overtaken Switzerland and Canada as the 
main supplier of the metal. 
, In the first three months of this year, the United 
States Imported 35 1,368 ounces of Soviet gold valued at 
$45,988 million or $130.88 an ounce. 

Cubs and Robbers 
(The Lafayette Sun) A gun toting, knife wielding, Cub 

cout was arrested and taken to Juvenile Hall for in-
vestigation after attempting to rob patrons In two 
Lafayetts, California stores . 

" He scared us to death," said a spokesman at the 
Tickled Pink Beauty Salon . " He pulled out a gun which 
looked fake and attempted to rob us . We told him to 
leave and got him outside and locked the door. Then he 
tried to ram the door with his bicycle." 

Official Straw Votes 
(The Door) The Watergate scandal may be scaring 

people away from politics-but what's happening in 
Ortonville, Michigan, is ridiculous. 

In the recent election in Ortonville, for tax aS~t!~ · Jr, 
no candidates signed up. On election day, however, 
there were four write-in votes, each for a different 
person. 

Since no winner could be named, Oakland County 
Clerk lynn Allen ca lled a meeting of the four winners to 
resolve the tie . Not one of the winning candidates 
showed up. 

Clerk Allen rt!fused to give up. He went into the 
street, selected three passers-by, and had them draw 
straws on behalf of the absent candidates. 

The final winner was Ronald D. Richards, an Or-

Freedom's Just Another Word ... 
(The Door) President Nixon recently presented " The 

Freedom Award" to his former advisor and Secretary of

The rreedomAward is the highest civilian honor a

Course Terminations 
I n a meeting of the Provosts of the four Colleges it 

was decided to terminate some of the Interdisciplinary 
Program courses; specifica lly Interdisciplinary 10 
(Interpersonal Behavior) and Interdisciplinary 11 
(C linica l Perspectives) . The reasons are still not totally 
clear, but some of the issues involved seemed to be the 
use of lecture appointments instead of regu lar faculty 
(thus having practicing psychologists teaching the 
courses) . Also, Muir Provost John Stewart is quoted as 
saying that the courses (1.0. 10 and 11) " do not meet the 
high academic standard of the University of California" . 

The Provosts have agreed to arrange a meeting to 
discuss this situation with concerned students. All 
students who are interested in the fate of these courses 
please contact Provost John Stewart (x1901) or Michele 
Stone (x1030) for the time of this meeting.

Revelle To Sponsor 
Photo Contest 

Last week the Revelle Committee on College 
Aff.irs voted to sponsor UCSD's first photography 
contest . The contest will be open to all studt.nts ilt 
UCSD .nd six cash prizes will be ilwarded, 

The organizer of the contest is Robin Mitchell , • 
sophomore ilt Revelle. Mitchell silid th.t the contest 
is designed, "to give UCSD photographers. chal'lce 
to be recognized and possibly benefit from the art 
that they have spent many long nights in the 
darkroom perfecting.". 

Photographs will be judged in three different 
categories: people, unusual [including special ef-
fects ] ~nd aesthetic [scenes and "pretty picture~;" ] . 
The ca'tegories are designed to give the judges and 
contestants general guidelines to follow and not to 
eliminate any photos. 

tn each category a 525 first prize and a 510 secorui 
prize will be awarded . In addition, the winnir'J! 
pictures will be published in the last issue of th e 
Triton Times. 

All entries should be approximately 9" x 7" or 8" x 
10" and mounted in some fashion to aid judging and 
displaying. A maximum of 4 pictures molY be enterred 
by each contest.nt. Each should be separately 
wrapped and have.n entry blank .«ached to it. 

All contestants must be am.teurs, No conteslant 
can have earned any money from his or her 
photographic skills. 

Further information ilbout the contest can 'be

The marketing research specialists who gave 
America the Datsun automobiles (260Z, 8-210, 610, 
510, Lil Hustler truck, etc.) have determined that 16% 
of the 8,000,000 college students in this country will 
buy a new or used car within the next year. 

Using a slide-rule and sheer blind luck, we 
figured that equaLs 8,160 persons of the 5 L,OOO in 
San Diego's university communities. 

So we figured we'd talk to you briefly and 
clearly: at Tel ry Allen Datsun in EI Cajon (EI Cajon 
Boulevard at Marshall just off the freeway from 
whence you can see our sign on a clear day) we be-
lieve that people involved in education (getting or 
giving) deserve more than a hearty slap on the back 
and "well done" and all that other stuff. We believe 
that the break you'll be giving all of us by getting 
an education is worth a break to you right now on a 
new or used automobile. 

We'd like to prove It to you. 
With special financing to students. With spe· 

cial deals for students. With special care of students 
and faculty alike. 

Now's the time. You'll probably be working 
this summer, so that'll give you good credit. 

So drop by Terry Allen Datsun. For a new 
Datsun or a used economy car of any make or model. 

It's worth a lot more than a slap on the back.

UCSF Researcher Warns 
AhoutLittle-Known VD 

SAN FRANCISCO-"Venereal diseases caused by TRIC 
agents are becoming more frequent and take more time 
to manage than syphilis and gonorrhea; moreover, they 
can cause just as much damage." 

So says Dr. Julius Schachter, researcher at the 
University of California, San Francisco, who devotes his 
research efforts to the study of the microorganisms 
called TRIC (Trachoma-Inclusion-Conjunctivitis), 
known to scientists as chlamydia bedsonia . 

They are pathogenic to !pan and animals and cause 
psittacosis (parrot fever); trachoma (the Single most 
important preventable disease causing blindness); 
lymphogranuloma venereum; g~nital tract infections 
which cause some of the same symptoms as gonorrhea; 
eye diseases of adults; and eye diseases of new-borns 
(infected by passage through the mother's infected birth 
canal) . 

Says Schachter: " Unfortunately, most people, and 
also many physicians, know almost nothing about Vo 
caused by TRIC agents, and they should." He explains 
that TRIC VD, which can cause urethritis in men and 
cervicitis in women , often is mistaken for gonorrhea 
symptomatology, because TRIC VD is difficult to 
diagnose. TRIC agents CANNOT be grown on artificial 
media the way the gonococcus is grown, and only since 
1%9 has research provided good methods of diagnosing 
TRIC agents. Although discovered as early as 1909, it 
was not until the 1960's that TRIC agents were isolated 
from the genital tract . 

He points out that , "These agents help explain why 
some patients (more than 30 percent in some studies) 
treated for gonorrhea have persisting symptoms, for 
they may also have a coexisting, unrecognized TRIC 
In fec tion . Peni cillin can cure gonorrhea but does not 
cu re TRIC infections, although these CAN be cured by 
other antibiotics, and that's why diagnosis is so im-
portant. " 

According to Schachter, three to five percent of 
women may harbor gonorrheal or TRIC infections and 
not even know it. Consequently, they would not seek 
treatment and could transmit the infection to their 
sexual partners unwittingly. To a lesser degree, men too 
may have a non-symptomatic infection and pass it on . 

Schachter and his colleagues are now working 
cl inically with physiCians to help increase their 
awareness and understanding of TRIC infections- their 
ymptomatology and the methods by which they can be 

diagnosed and treated. Another area of their research is 
to study people who have both genital tract infections 
and eye infections to learn how genitally transmitted 
strains of TRIC agents may be associated with a 
trachoma-like disease in the eye. Fortunately, this 
condition is more benign than classical trachoma. 

Schachter, associate professor of epidemiology and 
medic ine, whose research is supported by grants from 
the Allergy and Infectious Diseases branch of the 
Nat ional Institutes of Health, hopes to obtain support to 
establish VD centers on the UCSF campus and 
elsewh ere. He beli eves such centers would greatly help 
to decrease the spread of VD and the vast toll of human 

~u ffering, severe pathology and sterility VO leaves in its 
wake. In San Franc isco alone, VD cases continue to be 
reported at 2.000 cases oer 100,000 population . 

"We hope to do what has not been done so tar by any 
county VD agency-to study the whole gamut of 
venereally transmitted infections," says Schachter. " Not 
just gonorrhea and syphilis, but TRIC, the viruses such 
as herpes, and mycoplasma organisms. We also want to 
learn more about their suspected role in causing genital 
cancer . We must study those patients who have 
multiple venereal infections and their response to 
treatment in order to develop better diagnostic and 
treatment methods. Certainly, patients would benefit 
from such a comprehensive approach ."

'MY HAMI II .IOHH DIAN AND I DlMAND lQUA&. nMI"" 

Where is the 
Considerationby Ron Bee 

Tuesday, April 30, 1974, 
at the Academic Senate 
Meeting, an attitude of 
Insensitivity towards 
students surfaced which 
bordered on authoritarian 
absolutism . Before the 
Senate, to be voted on, was 
a proposal for a revision in 
UC D's grading policy It 
was amazing how little 
pu bliCity this proposed 
change received, and yet it 
was still to be voted on . The 
proposal included a 
prOVision for th awarding 
of " plus" grads and " minus " 
grad s on final transcripts -
also meaning that a plus 
would rai se a grade up by 
33 of a grade point and a 

minus would bring it down 
33 of a grade point This 

being of a considerable 
consequence to student s, it 
was equally amazing that 
they had not been con-
su ited . 

Dr. L onard Newmark, 
chariman of the Committee 
on Educational Policy 
(CEP), presented the 
proposal, adding that it was 
obviously to everyone' s 
benefit to pass the 
proposed revisions now. 
This was an " obvious " 
example of railroading . 
Students at the meeting, as 
well as some of the faculty , 
voiced their opinions that 
the benefits were not 
obvious, and that student 
consultation was needed. 
The reply to this was that 
last year , the student 
representative on CEP knew 
about the proposal and 
since he failed to bring it to 
the attention of students 
last year, it was not the 
Academic Senate ' s 
respons i bi I ity to do 
anything else. 

1 his conclusion is not 
justified . First of all , this 
year IS this year . Are new 
student s (freshman and 
tran fer students), going to 
have to pay for someone 
else's mistake made last 
year? Secondly, how can 
one student represent 7,000 
others effectively in such a 
matter? On the CEP last 

triton 

year, one student 
represented 7,000 others. 
However, eight faculty 
members represented 648 
faculty . Beyond the 
question of fair 
representation, I seriously 
doubt that the faculty 
would endorse the con-
su I tat ion of on Iy one 
faculty member when 
dealing with matters of 
promotion 

As for the fate of the 
propo ai , it wa ent back 
to the CEP because of the 
need to clean up the 
am ndm nt and for 
rea ons of expediency-there 
w re more Important Items 
on the agenda to be dealt 
With . In any case, tudents 
Will get a month to give 
" Input" Into the final 
decision Hut the di sap-
pointing part IS that the first 
concern of the Senate was 
not student consultation 

Yes, ~tudent s are living, 
breathing , thinking in -
dividuals that do exist in 
spite of computer cards , 
and they do care what 
happens to themselves . It is 
not fair or even proper to 
ask the faculty to represent 
the opinions of the students 
when they cast their votes 
in the Academic Senate. 
Ideally, the interest of the 
faculty and students should 
be in considerable har-
mony. But, the fact is , there 
are differences between the 
two with regard to the 
.emphasis and relevancy 
placed on the different 
aspects of academia. All 
concerned should be heard , 
and not assumed. 

-Our goal should be to 
work together so as to 
create a better University 
community, not separately 
so as to alienate and instill 
distrust. The April 30th 
meeting, with its attitudes 
of insensitivity, was un-
fortunately indicative of the 
latter. It would be ap-
propriate for the Academic 
Senate to ask itself the 
question, "Who and what is 
the University really forr"

"Cheat" 
Response 

Editor : 
I'm still in shock after 

reading M . Powell's , "The 
Big Cheat", in last friday's 
Triton Times. 

Powell writes that seniors 
should not be allowed to TA 
classes; that this job should 
be left to the graduate 
students . The grad student , 
says Powell, is more ex-
perienced in teaching than 
the senior , besides being 
more mature and more 
carefully selected . Seniors, 
teaching for their first time, 
" wi II i nvaria bly perform 
their worse." Of course, the 
student is being cheated if 
the TA is not qualified to 
teach the course.' 

However, qualification 
should be based on the 
ability to teac h a particular 
subjec t, not on the present 
fac tors of the candidate's 
year in school , GPA and 
previous teaching ex-
perience. What if the TA 
has a high CPA is a second 
year grad student, and has 
TA-ed three times before? If 
he is a bad T A, none of 
these factors are helpful to 
the confused student. And 
what of the undergrad who 
has a low GPA and has 
never taught a class beforer 
One can no more say he 
will be bad than one can 
say the above grad student 
will be good . 

I \.\111 be T A-ing as a 
junior next quarter . I feel , 
even with my low GPA and 
my lack of experience and 
units in my major, that I 
possess a strong potential 
for teaching, even my first 
time, when I perform my 
"worst", I will still out-teach 
some of the carefully 
selected, more mature and 
experienced grad students 
that are running around 
campus , An important 
factor that Powell overlooks 
is that there is a higher 
percentage of grads that are 
new to UCSD than there are 
seniors . r once had a grad 
T A who was new to this 
school and had never taken 
the course he was a T A for . 
Consequently, he was often 
unable to answer specific 
question that dealt with the 
course in terms of this 
school .

The second phase "'af the 
" big cheat" is that the 
University is exploiting the 
undergraduate' s cheap 
labor, thus denying money 
and jobs to the needy grads 
and the unemployed profs . 
Apis 10, like many other 
freshman courses, has had 
It'S share of good and bad 
profs. However, sometimes 
the class is taught so un-
clearly and so unorganized 
that I feel l ike taking over 
and teaching the class 
myself The point is, if the 
University is going to pay 
money tor teachers, they 
should get people who are 
able to do just that, not 
grad' students who do it 
because they need ' the 
money, or profs, whose 
only talent is research . 

The final point that 
Powell makes is that by 
letting seniors receive four

cheated out of a course" 
and lhat this " makes a 
decietful sham out of the 
requirements for a 
degree .... the senior is

material and not being 
exposed to advanced topics 
in his major ... " 

Concerning the abuse of 
the degree requirements, 
there are already enough 
classes at UCSD that 
preform this abuse. If a 
student wants to cheat 
himself, there are several 
routes besides this one 
open to him . 

As for re learn i ng fresh-
man material , I can only see 
profit in this . The student is 
now able to explore, in

Editor : 

While standing in line for 
the showing of " Deep 
Throat" last Saturday, I was 
approached by two paper-
carrying students. CUriOUS, I 
accepted their letter which 
turned ou,t to be (as has 
been the case every time 
I 've accepted literature) 
another message from the 
omnipresent Ch r istian 
o rganizations on campus . 

This note, so ridiculously 
and illogically written that 
it is not worth criticizing, 
attempted to convince me 
that it was wrong to see 
Deep Throat . Its contents 
follows : 

The movie you are about 
to see has little to do with 
sex. Actually, it is about 
body parts and how they 
function . People, who have 
and enjoy sex, are not 
portrayed in this movie. So 
you are being ripped off. 
Think about it. Should 
people be characterized in 
this way? from one point of 
view, they are being ex-
ploited here- used by some 
producer to make money. It 
is common in our society to 
see people as less than 
people, or as tools for 
profit. 

As Christians, we have 
our reasons for not liking 
this movie While some of us 
are prudes, and others are 
secretly curious, we agree, 
for the most part, that 
" Deep Throat" is Inhuman, 
exploitive and contrary to 
Jesus' concept of human 
selluality . If you agree that 

better way. Stop settling for 
second best. 

I read their 
"propaganda", had a good 
laugh and saw the show 
Later I wondered, what 
purpose is there In printing 
up and passing out these 
message Unfortunately, 
the answer IS qUite Simple 
They are part of the never 
ending stream of subtle 
pre,sure to soliCit "un-

believers~ to the ChrIStian 
faith , 

I highly respect each 
persons right to hiS own 
religious beliefs, even If I 
don't agree With th em Yet 
these people don't respect 
mi ne i n tu rn because 
they're constantly out to get 
me to change mine. 

It appears that ther .. I~ a 
well organized recru iting 
operation on campus which 
is out to change peoples 
religious bel iefs to ac-
ceptance of Jesus- and I 
resent it!!

could George Winne have 
performed after the date of

resignation? The anqulsh

" Foolish or dangerous or 
both" is how Rep . les Aspin 
of Wisconsin describes an 
intensified military interest in 
the Maneuvering Re-entry 
Vehicle (MaRV). It is not a 
new idea. The military and its 
contractors have been toying 
with a maneuvering capacity 
for years and the necessary 
technology is unfolding. But 
since the implementation of 
SALT I any reference to this 
work in connection with a 
specific weapons system-
such as Trident-was highly 
classified until Represen -
tative Aspin released it in 
January . To understand why 
the Pent'!8on should wish to 
keep any knowledge of 
MaRV developments from 
the American people-and 
insofar as it can . from the 
Russian military--it is 
necessary to review the 
caref ull y calc ul ate d 
deployment of forces on 
which SALT I depends. 

But regarding nuclear 
attack weapons. SALT I 
regulates only the number of 
missiles and the number of 
missile-launching submarines 
and underground silos . There 
is no limit on the number of 
r~ntry vehicles that can be 
carried per missile. Thus. the 
real importance of the SALT I 
agreement is that both 
countries tacitly admit that 
nuclear war is no longer a 
reasonable option. Since it 
was signed. the Russians 
have begun MI RV testing 
(which they are entitled to do 
under the terms of the 
agreement). and this has 
provided our military w ith 
propaganda for advanCing 
their own projects. But for 
practical calculations. such 
activity on either side is 
i rrelevant . We are now able 
to destroy Russia's urban and 
i ndustrial areas thirty-four 
times over; they can destroy 
ours thirteen times. If we 
halved our capabil ity and 
they doubled theirs. it would 
make no difference--total 
destruction is total 
destruction and multiples of 
totality have only rhetorical 
reality . 

of MaRVs the situation 
radically changes . MIRVs are 
area assault weapons. Either 
nation can launch them and 
destroy the other nation. but 
it cannot hope to hit more 
than a few of the opponent's 
MIRVs. emplaced in silos and 
on submarines at sea. Thus 
its "victory" will last only for 
the period of minutes until 
the retaliatory MIRVs arrive. 
The "scenario" for any 
nuclear attack in such cir-
c umstances is the an -
nihilation of both nations. 
But MaRVs can be guided 
right to the particular target; 
they can destroy the MIRVs 
in their silos and beneath the 
sea, and deprive the 
receiving nat io n of its 
retaliatory force . Thus the 
possibility of an unan -
swerable first str ike is 
reintroduced into the 
planning for nuclear war. 

were accurate enough and 
powerful enough to 
devastate urban and in-
dustrial centers to a degree 
unacceptable to any nation. 
What. then. was the need for 
these new, very expensive. 
very provocative devices if 
not to destroy hardened 
underground silos or sea-
based submarine launchers? 
So after those few days in the 
summer of 1972. the public 
could read no more about 
this new first-strike offensive 
goal. A Department of 
Defense spokesman brushed 
off accusations by stating 
that the idea was merely to 
knock out hardened enemy 

that $49.8 million of Trident's 
funding for that year will also 
be used for the purpose . And 
now Representative Aspin 
has sounded the alarm on 
observing in the Pentagon's 
latest research and 
development report that a 
whopping $250 million will 
be asked for MaRV in the 
next fiscal year .

1.710 assault missi les with no

Some study of MaRV 
under the ABRES program is 
not considered a violation of 
the agreement. reasonable 
technological research being 
expected in case SALT I is not 
renegotiated five years from 
now. But a quarter-bi Ilion 
dollar budget looks like more 
than a paper study--
especially when ABRES is 
providing test booster 
rockets to the Navy's MaRV 
development program. The 
Pentagon states : " There is no 
plan to deploy a MaRV on 
target at this time nor. in 
fact. to enter full engineering 
development" (emphasis 
added) . Naturally. the 
military dislikes any public 
discussion of MaRV; its very 
concept mocks the name of 
the Department of Defense. 
and if the country ever 
grasped what was at stake. 
there would be an uproar . 
Americans do not like to 
think of themselves as 
threatening annihilation to 
any other c ountry . and 
certainly they do not relish 
the notion of being an-
nihilated themselves. But 
supposing our c itizens 
remain unaware of what is 
going on . there is no reason 
to expect that the Russians 
will be inattentive. Their 
response may well be to 
scrap the SALT achievements 
and kick off a whole new 
round of nuclear threat and 
counter-threat .

Morbid 
Editor : 

I am deeply concerned 
about the recent showing of 
"Deep Throat" on campus. 
This movie is a callous, 
dehumanizing exploitation 
of people, and of sex. I 
strongly question the 
argument that to be 
" educated" in this matter 
requires our viewing of this 
film . 

Is our exposure to such 
grotesque material truly 
necessary for us to make an 
intellectual evaluation on 
this subject? I think not! If we 
hold the viewing of this 
movie so lightly. what is the 
limit of perverse and 
degrading material we will 
consume to satisfy our 
morbid curiosity? 

Frankly. as a Christian and 
a human being , I 
wholeheartedly object to the 
showing of such material, 
which serves only to corrupt 
the God given gift of sex. and 
lowers human relation ships 
to the leve l of the gutter. We 
must be cautious not to allow 
ourselves to become so 
insensitive as to let such 
material permeate our m inds 
wi thout developi ng a si nse of

Editor'S note: 
The following article is 

reprinted from the Monthly 
Review magazine. with their

This is part one of two 
parts. 

With few exceptions the 
economists of the capitalist 
countries, liberal and 
conservative alike. are 
agreed that in the nearly four 
decades si nce t he

Money, governments have 
been in possession of. and 
have successfully utilized. 
means to control the level of 
economic activity and 
prevent the occurrence of 
seriou s depreSSions. To quote 
Harvard's Nobel Pri ze 
winning economist Kenneth 
J. Arrow: 

The new economic ideas 
of Keynes and his disciples 
have been translated into 
policy with almost un -
precedented speed, The idea 
that the state. through its 
decisions to spend, tax, and 
regulate the supply of 
money, could reduce 
unemployment to levels far 
lower than those in t he 
depths of previous 
depressions was accepted 
among both economists and 
political leaders, and has 
shown itself to work in 
practice with great siccess . In 
every advanced coun try, the 
post-World War 1/ record is 
like that of a new economy. 
(New York Times. March 26, 
1973) 

Let us look for a moment 
at the U.S. record (I will 
return to the others later on). 
It is true that since World 
War II there have been no 
depressions comparable to 
that of the 1930·s. But is this 
because economists and 
political leaders have put 
their heads together and 
decided upon appropriate 
spending. tax. and monetary 
policies to head one off every 
time it threatened? Or is it 
because there has been a 
tremendous increase in the 
general level of government 
spending. with armaments 
and war playing by far the 
largest part? (I presume that 
neither the economists nor 
the political leaders would 

wish to claim that the 
military spending is merely 
the form taken by Keynesian 
ideas when put into prac-
tice.) 

To these questions our 
economist friends would 
probably reply that while for 
overriding political or 
foreign-policy reasons the 
requisite amount of 
government spending has in 
fact been for military pur-
poses, if this had not been 
the case it would have been 
possible to spend a great deal 
more for welfare objectives. 
with much the same 
economic results . In their 
eyes, the theory of the 
controllability of the level of 
econom ic activity is 
therefore vindicated 
regardless of what the money 
is spent on . 

If this were reall y so , 
however. would we not 
expect that the controllers. 
helped by the large military 
budget, would have had an 
easy ti me maintain ing a 
reasonably sat isfactory level 
of economic activi ty 
throughout the postwar 
period? Surely with 20 
percent or more of the 
Amer ican people living 
below the officially defined 
poverty line and with such 
projects as decent low-cost 
housi ng. pollution control , 
and mass transportation

has never been any lack of

notorious fact that even in

unemployed in 1938. (It 
should be noted that both 
1970 and 1938 were years of 
recession following a long 
period of cyclical upswing 
and shou ld therefore be fairly 
comparable.) 

The fi rst problem was to 
get an es t imate of real . as 
distinct from officially 
counted. unemployment. 
si nce everyone familiar with 
the subject knows that there 
is a large discrepancy . * 
Working from official data 
on labor force parti cipation 
rates. which were steadily 
declining for male workers 
during most of the 19505 and 
19605, and making an ad-
justment for involuntary part-
time workers, we concl uded 
that a conservative estimate 
of real unemployment was 
8.1 million (9.4 percent of 
what would have been the 
labor force if jobs had been 
avai lable). To this we added 
those in the armed forces (2 .9 
million). civilian employees 
of the Defense' Department 
(1 .2 million) , those employed 
in producing goods for 
Defense Department (3 
million). and those employed 
because of what economists 
ca ll the multiplier effect. i .e .• 
workers employed in 
satisfying the demand 
generated by the incomes of 
those di rectly employed by 
the military budget (7.1 
million) . These items total · 
22.3 million . This is just over 
25 percent of the 1970 labor 
force adjusted to include 
those not officially counted 
as unemployed. 

This compares with an 
official unemployment figute 
of 19.0 percent in 1938 
However. if we make ad-
justments for hidden 
unemployment at that time 
and add to the expanded 
total the relatively small 
number of defense-related 
employed, we would 

If my Keynesian friends 
wish to dispute these facts or 
estimates, I would be happy 
to hear from them, I confess, 
however, that I do not expect 
to They like to talk about the 
record , but they are shy 
about subjecting it to a 
concrete historical analysis 
In this connection it IS worth 
noting, if only In passing, 
that they have not yet come 
up with a coherent theory of 
the Great Depression and 
why it was so much worse 
than any previous capital ist 
depression, Need I add that 
without such a theory It is 
quite impossible to provide 
any rational analysis of what 
might have happened in the 
postwar period in the ab-
sence of vastly expanded 
military spending?

vanced capital i5t countries. 
they ask, and especially 
Germany and Japan. the two

employment records and the 
lowest levels of military 
spending . 

I t is impossi ble to answer 
this question adequately in a 
brief essay. especially Since, 
to the best of my knowledge, 
no one and least of all the 
Keynesians. has made a 
serious effort to do so. I can

general lines along wh ich I

UCSD Faculty and Other Musical Instruments 
Thi., weekend, two films from France will be 

featured In the Saturday night series, Alain 
'Resna ls' "Last Year at Marienbad" and jean 
Cocte u's " Beauty and the Beast." 

A sense of timelessness pervades " Last Year 
at Marienbad, " a story of love's uncertainties. 
Resnais casts his mannequin-like characters 
adrift in a surreal sea of deja-vue 

" Beauty and the Beast" is classic Cocteau 
and is a faithful adaptation of the legendary 
fairy tale by Mme Leprince de Beaumont. The 
fi lm was made in 1946. Both films will be 
screened at 7.30 pm in USB 2722, tickets Sl .oo. 

Sunday night, the second evening of the 
World's Best Short Films will take place, also in 
USB 2722. The program will include "The 
Apple," a stick drawing animation which will 
explain the signifigance of an apple falling . 
"Gumbasia ," a five-m inute look at clay as it 
metamorphoses to music and " jumprope," a 
dreamlike look at a girl experiencing a jum-
prope through angular distortion, super slow 
motion, and remarkable composition, are both 
the kind of film that brought the most response 
from viewers at last Sunday's screeni",!, 

The season's final UCSD Music 
Faculty Concert Tuesday, May 14, at 
8: 15 in Recital Hall 409, Matthews 
Campus, will be a memorable oc-
casion. All works to be presented are 
noteworthy, as are the performers, 
all of whom have had extensive 
professional experience . 

Spanish composer Manuel de 
Falls's CONCERTO is considered a 
landmark in that it signifies the 
revival of the harpsichord as a 
concert instrument in thi century . 

Elizabeth Hamilton, harpsichord, 
was official harpsichordist for 
Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia . 
Miss Hamilton recently studied with 
noted harpsichordist Igor Kipnis with 
whom shw will perform during the 
coming year. 

Other performers in this work and 
throughout the program are Karen 
Reynolds, flute; oboe, High 
Matheny, whose concert and recital 
activities have taken him to almost 

every state in the U.S. as well as 
Canada, England, Wales, Belgium, 
Germany, Austria, Denmark and 
Italy; Eugene Gratovich, violin, has 
appeared with the Philadelphia 
Symphony and was first violinist 
with the Esterhazy String Quartet ; 
Mel Warner, clarinet, has been 
associate principal clarinetist with 
the St . Louis Symphony, and 
featured soloist with the Beverly 
Hills Trio, the Feld Quartet, the 
Westside Symphony of LA , the 
Oakland Symphony and the St. 
Louis Symphony; Peter Farrell, cello, 
has an international reputat ion as 
solist and teachpr of cello and viola 
da Gamba. Thomas Nee, conductor, 
is music director of the La Jolla 
Symphony and the New Hampshire 
Summer Music Festiva: . 

was the same as Bach's. Nancy 
Turetzky, flutist, has been touring 
Europe this year, including Brussels, 
Cologne, Poland, Switzerland and 
England. Domenico Dragonetti, the 
most outstanding contrabass of his 
day, wrote " Duo for Contrabass". 
Bertram Turetzky, internationally 
known as a leading contrabass in our 
day, plays contrabass. 

Another highlight of the evening is 
"Cantata Nel dolce dell'oblio" by 
Handel , Beverly Ogdon, soprano. 
During the past years soprano 
Beverly Ogdon sang Socrates in a 
staged version of Satie's "Socrate", 
Webern 's Opus 14, Krenek 's 
" Quintina" and "Wechselahmen" 
and Roger Reynold 's" Again". Sylvia 
Greenfield, flutist, is a member of 
the newly formed Festival Chamber 
Ensemble and has appeared a solist 
with major orchestras throughout 
California. 

Other noted works to be featured 
on the Faculty Concert are 
"Quartetto" by Telemann, the most 
popular composer in his time, which There is no admission charge 

, 

From Great Britain there will be a futuristic 
animation about our world as we move closer 
to machine con trol of our systems. "Moods of 
Surfing" is one of the best su rfing shorts ever 
filmed, taking a gold medal at the New York 
International Festival , filmed by Greg 
MacGillivray and Jim Freeman . 

For those who have yet to try skydiving, 
Skycapers will let you know what to expect. 
Filmed with a camera attached to a chutist's 
helmet, a sensation of falling 200 miles per 
hour is achieved . 

Film can produce wierd and sensational 
Images and can send cowboys and Indians 
zipping across the plains without visible means 
of locomotion. In " Blaze Glory," the effects are 
hilarious . Computer animated films can also 
produce sensational images, as in "Lapis." 

From Albert Lamorisse, director of "The Red 
Balloon," comes "White Mane, " an allegorical 
film about the taming of a wild and beautiful 
stallion . The film won Grand Prize at Can nes. 

"The Unicorn in the Garden" is taken from 
the james Thurber short story about a man 
whose wife seeks to have him committed for 
the simple derangement, seei ng a unicorn in 
the garden . The stop action film, "Dream of 
Wild Horses," is a beautiful and detailed 
picture of wild horses as they run, catching a 
glimpse of complete freedom . 

These films and more are included in the 
program, a salute to the best in the making of 
short films . Starting time will be 7:30 PM in 
USB 2722, tickets, Sl .oo. Tickets may be 
purchased in advance at the Student Center 
Box Office.

Sneaking in back doors may have gone out 
with your last pair of roller skate or set of 
Mickey Mantle baseball cards, but for those 
with a penchant for drama, there is one Back-
door open this weekend The Cu ltural Arts 
Board at San Diego State will present a two-i lOll' 
play by Georg Buchner, Woyzeck Saturda\ and 
Sunday evenings. Buchner's dramatization of 
the events leading to the death of Johann 
Christia n Woyzeck in 1924 promises to be an 
intense psychological drama . Admi slon I 
free, and curtain time is at 8 p.m. 

If midterms fi nd you in the mood for more 
light-hearted fa r , George Bernard Shaw's "The 
Bolshe\lik Empress" will be presented by Del 
Mar's New Heritage Theatre. The one-hour 
playlet will be performed Friday and Saturday 
evenings at 8 p.m. Typical of Shavian humor, it 
sports wi tty dialog and a plat that keeps 
everyone guessing. Following Shaw, at 9 and 10 
p.m., are two other short plays, "Krapp's Last 
Tape" and "BOll and COli". Krapp, played by 
Nathan Hass, 'converses with himself via taped 
recordings. The second play is an English farce, 
in which two bachelors, unbeknownst to each 
other, share an apartment. With all this 
confUSion, your own problE'ms are sure to be 
forgotten . For reservations and furthur in-
formation, call 459-3435 . 

As we all know , Art- with a capital 'A'-does 
not abound in San Diego. But-and that's a big 
BUT-it does pass through . In fact, many fire 
exhibits find their way into the Fine Arts 
Gallery in Balboa Park, The inaugural 
exhibition of the newly-opened Gildred-Parller-
Grant Wing is entitled "Monumental Paintings 
of the 60's". Composed of fifteen large can-
vasses by contemporary artist, the exhibit will 
be open through June 16th. For those whose 
taste runs to the more traditional, the same 
museum is showing a collection of 17th 
century Italian drawings until May 19th. 

Although imported art is scarce in the area, 
another exhibition at the Fine Arts Gallery 
lends some truth to the rumor that local talent 
exists in San Diego. Opening Sunday, this 
mixed media display includes enameling and 
other works by local craftspersons . 

A day-outi ng to the LOI Anleift County 
MURum of Art would be well-worth the time 
and gas this weekend . Completing its run this 
Sunday will be an exhibition of " Impressionists 
and the Salon, 1874-1886". Including paintings, 
watercolors, drawings, prints, and sculpture, 
these 70 works are representati\le of the in-
novation and excitement of this period. 

Even if you can't make it this weekend, two 
other outstandinll exhibits will remain at the 
museum through May. The first, a collection of 
paintings from the China Dynasty is truly awe-
inspiring. The second, 29 Picasso e"8ravings, 
are from a series of 347 he did throullh 1968. 
The subject matter of each frame varies, as do 
the engravinll techniques . Yet, separately and 
together, these enlVavinlis offer an insillht into 
artist's moods and thought, while provokinll 
the audience to identify with these ideas,

HARD LABOR - Three 001 Night. AilC Retords 

Where have all the pop groups gone .. .Iong time 
passing . 

And we can all surely remember the day when 1 I ~e 
Dog Night was trul" hot-stuff (and I guess they still are, 
at certain levels) and not just teeny-bopper rock. 

Once you've lost your respect with the " music" 
crowd, and have reportedly descended to appealing to 
the same audiences who cater to the Patridge Family 
and Osmond Brothers, you know it's going to be "Hard 
Labor" indeed to make that critical return to ac-
ceptance. 

Well, I'm one who is willing to give credit to the dogs 
for at least one thing. In the past, they have served as 
the first showcase for a lot of previously unheard of 
composers including Harry Nillson ("One"), Laura Nyro 
(" Eli'S Comin' " ), Paul Williams ("just an Old Fashioned 
love Song"), Randy Newman ("Mama Told Me Not to 
Come"), and the team of British unheard-ofs Elton john 
and Bernie Taupman ("Lady Samantha"). 

So obviou~ly the three dogs have some sense of 
what's worth recording and what's not. And yet, while 
the discovered composers became big with the hip set, 
Three Dog Night was discarded as kid stuff . 

And perhaps justly so with a number of fairly weak 
albums which began sp ringing up, such as " Harmony" 
and "Cyan~ to name the most recent. 

The new Three Dog Night album, however, IS that big 
step towards perhaps widening their appeal once again . 
The album is the bands first "concept" album, the 
concept being tied to a circusy calliope type theme 
which starts , finishes, and runs softly, almost in-
discreetly between cuts all through the album . 

This " concept " feel is also extended to the record 
package, which includes an illustration of a strange 
monster-baby-mannequin type creature giving birth to 
the record to be found inside, as well as a medical file 
folder giving all the background info on what is called 
(forgive them) "The strangest birth on record". What the 
jacket and title have to do with the circus theme is 
beyond me. 

None the less, among the weaker material on the 
album, half of the songs stand out as trong potential 
singles and interesting cuts in general. partlculiarly 
Allen Toussaint's "P lay something Sweet", the albums 
opener "Sure as I'm Siltin Here", and the hit single 
which grows out of the circus melody "The how Must 
Go On" which quickly shows off the bands strengths 
(su,ch as they are) (on the three man vocal energy. The 
addition to the band 's Ptll'sonal of Skip Konte on syn-
thesizer and additional keyboards adds a nice filling out 
to the instrumental end of the band 

At any rate, it's the strongest show Three Dog Night 
has shown on record in years, and while they may sti ll 
never win acclaim with the acid-rock crowd, they seem 
to be doing all right. (Hey! Did you know Three Dog 
Night was voted most popular rock band at Brigham 
Young University last fall, but weren't allowed to play 
there by the administration due to the hard rock nature 
of their songsm) 
MOONT AN - Golden Earing, MCA Records 

bass line with the big energy rhythm guitars, smas he~ 
through by solo lines for dynamic effect, but they uJe 
,nis formula imaginatively and avoid the Black Sabbath 
mono-syballic pitfall, and create continual change of 
pace . 

The occasional addition of flute, saxophone, and 
synthesizer to the heavy metal stuff gives the album 
distinction and flavor. An above the standard cut heavy 
metal band with a palatable sound . 

SON OF DRACULA Harry Nilsson - Rapple Records 

More fun for Schmilsson fans. From "Son of Sch-
milsson" to " Son of Dracula", this time it's the sound-
track from the Apple Film "Son of Dracula" starring 
Harry and good buddy Ringo Starr (one time member of 
the Beatles, remember?) 

If the record jacket interior is any indication of the 
film it looks like its going to be quite something . I can't 
swear to the plot, but in short (as gleaned from the 
dialog on the album) Count Down, the son of Dracula 
(Harry) is about to become the New King of the 
Netherworld . However, he falls In love, and decid.es to 
have the operation so that he can be human and really 
fall in love. And he does . 

The album at any rate, is largely dialog from the film 
with incidental music by orchestra pro Paul Buckmaster 
which sounds like nothing so much as Zappa's " 200 
Motels" . Along with thi S, are some of Nilsson's most 
beautiful songs including "Without You ", "Remember 
(Christmas)" , and "The Moonbeam Song", as well as one 
new bouncy cut " Daybreak". 
• Nilsson is an amazing vocal talent, and perhaps the 
only artist I know who can sing the lyric "On a fence 
with bits of crap along its bottom" and make it sound 
beautiful, just beautiful. 

A fun soundtrack, which no doubt IS even more fun 
when you've een the movie, which I for one, intend to. 

Exotic Birds and Fruits - Procol Harum. Chrysalis 
Records 

Well , now you see 'em, now you don't That is to say, 
remember the orchestra that 's been croppi ng up behind 
Procol Harum recently?? Well , it's just not there 
anymore. 

ThiS is an interesting commentary on the arrangement 
abilities of Procol Harum. Basically in the sidelight, the 
band came into big public recognition with its " Live 
with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra" album . Using 
this formula as being successful, the follow-up "Grand 
Hotel " had a lot of orchestral back-ups in it. That album 
was every bit as exciting and sharp . 

ow, with " Exotic Birds and Fruit", Procol Harum has 
quietly removed the orchestra all together, without 
yielding one inch of the ground they gained. Their 
arrangements are marvelously solid, and fill the or-
chestras void with no difficulty.

Rec. Dept. in such absurd games as 'Square Off Score 
and R.ip. To Lee we present a framed copy of th~ newly 
enshrined Selected Jocks emblem, which he can have if 
he cuts the graphic out of the paper and frames it 
himself. We thank Lee for the moral support we needed 
to put this insane column out again ... and again ... and 
again ... 

No Longer Kroe of S-
I-or our second award we turn to the hallowed 

national pastime of baseball . To San Diego's own, the 
Padres, we present The Come-from-Behind Award. for 
the first time in the Padre's history they have succeeded 
in escaping the cellar of the NL West at some time other 
than the first month of the season. In accomplishing this 
miraculous achievement the Padre's have won 11 out of 
their last 14 games, pushing Henry Aaron and the 
Atlanta Braves into the cellar by 3 percentage points. It 
looks as If there IS something good in a MacDonald's 
hamburger . 

In other baseball news we duly dub the Texas Rangers 
as the Mirage of the Year. Presently on top of the AL 
West: ,due. to the usual slow start of The A's, Billy 
Martin s Rangers have surprised one and all by winning 
more than they have lost so far this season . Our bet is 
that they will fall apart soon and the A's will take over 
their usual spot on top of the heap. 

Choking on Steak 
T.he annual Stanley Cup Choke Artist Award once 

again goes to the NY Rangers (possibly related to 
Texas?) as they managed to drop out of the running for 
the NHL Championship by losing to the expansionist 
upstarts from Philadelphia . The Rangers have the 
highest paid team in any sport (it is rumored that only 
three members of the team earn under $100,000 a year) . 
It proves that money can't buy everything.

Intercollegiate sailing 

does not receive its 
deserved notice at most 
colleges and universities -
UCSD is no exception. But 
then most colleges and 
universities do not have 
sailing teams worth noting. 
ThiS IS where UCSD is an 
exception .

consisting of such notabl~ 
skippers and crews as Dick 
Davis, Ed Trevelyan, Joan

undefeated, and .in 
recognition of this feat was 
picked from among the 
California colleges and 
universities to represent the 
West Coast at the Sugar 
Bowl Regatta in New 
Orleans. This regatta is the 
premier regatta outside of 
the Nationals. There the 
team place second behind 
Tulane University and in 
doing so became ranked 
second behind Tulane in 
the national standings . 

Since then they did well

Our First Letter 
To Coach Moss : 

I could not help but find 
your "focus on Nick White" 
absurd . I realize that you 
must be desparate to find a 
black ath lete on campus 
worthy of the name 
superstar or legend not that 
any honky is e,ther but this 
is ridiculous . Superstars do 
not have to be introduced 
to the public in 
newspapers ; they are 
already known . You say he's 
a legend ... A legend do s 
not play #1 singl s for 
UCSD; he plays #1 for 
Stanford or USc. A student 
legend does not "maintain" 
a 3.4 GPA as an Econ . major 
at Third; he graduates from 
Harvard Med. School with a 
4.0 (or at least from Revelle 
as a 2-sequence Bio. major.) 
Legends can beat the likes 
of a Howard Scho nfield; or 
haven't you heard of him . 

You conclude with, "Nick 
White's success story is 
one ... " What success story? 
Many people win tour-
naments and maintain a 3.4 
GPA. Does that constitute 
consummute success . I 
think not . Do you honestly 
believe Nick White even 
approches the likes of a Bill 
Walton, Olga Korbut, Mark 
Spitz or Johnny Miller? 

Nick White is an ex-
cellent tennis player with a 
lot of potential, but save 
the flashy vapid accolades 
of legendary superstardom 
for the NATIONAL 
ENQUIRER . 

Nick, good luck at 
Wimbledon . And Bob, keep 
k ep a copy of this focus on 
file . It might mean 
something in a few years. 
You prov you'r a 
superstar by being # 1, not 
aspiring to be.

Inexorable progress on the

last week's smashing and

bunch. Here's what tran-
spired (In a transcribed sort 
of way) .

D.P. I think th re should 
be intercollegiate bicycle 
racing here at school. It's a 
big thing in Europe and alot 
of people race bikes around 
here . 

UT: That's probably a 
good idea Dave. 

DH: I think its a pretty 
good department all 
around . I think the school 
has a lot of good sports and 
activities. I would like to 
see a gymnastics team here 
however. A lot of people at 
this school like gymnastics 
and have a lot of talent in 
the area. This school has a 
lot of sports and they 
should have gymnastics . 

B.O.: If they won't have 
osteopathy, then they 
should change the 
requirements around here. I 
mean physical fitness is 
needed by everyone . I'd like 
to know why they don't 
replace the Humanities 
requirement with tennis 
say. It's a good way to mee>t 
peoplp and good exercise. 
Besides , you 'd probably 
learn more in tennis rhiln in 
Humanities. 

UT: Well BO I'm not sure 
if the sport s department can 
dictate to what will replace 
what requirement but 
you're thinking sounds 
logical. Does anyone e lse . 
have anything else to say? 

T.S : Yes, I sometimes 
wonder about how things 
are graded around here. I 
mean how do the fencing 
classes get some credit and 
other classes don' t? I think 
WSI and lifesaving are two 
good examples. Both of

they make it, take notice;

Technology 

"Kluge" 
One of the fastest biological research devices ever 

designed-a machine which counts millions of in-
dividual ce lls ir'l minutes-is finding a whole series of 
new uses a\ The - 'Ik Institute. Originally designed at 
Los Alamos Scientlii'- Laboratory and modified by the 
Institute's instrumentation specialists, the ,flow 
microfluorometer, or "Kluge", was originally intended 
to support the cancer research of Dr. Robert Holley and 
his co-workers. Four other Institute researchers are now 
adding whole new dimensions to its capabilities and 
more are expected to use it as the machine is upgraded 
as planned. 

Irving Goldman, Manager of Technical Services, said 
the device was recently upgraded Significantly with the 
aid of funds from Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Meyerhoff. 
Basically, said Goldman, it permits researchers to 
illuminate individual ce lls as they flow through an 
Argon-Krypton laser beam . Because the cells have been 
specially stained, the laser light causes them to 
fluoresce or glow. The degree of fluorescence is a 
measure of the amount of DNA in the cell, a quantity 
that is extremely difficult to compute in any other way 
on a mass basis. 

The flow microfluorometer's use to date implies 
exciting new promise for a more advanced instrument. 
"What we desperately need to do now is develop a new 
one which will permit us not only to count cells but to 
measure their size, too," Goldman said. "We also need a 
machine which will also operate in another wavelength . 
If we cou ld improve on this model, we (Quid not only 
distinguish normal from abnormal cells, but we could 
also get rid of the abnormal and keep only the good 
cells ."

The X-Ray and Low Energy G-It~y Expt 
SciPt'ltists and engineers at the 

University of California at San Diego 
are now in the process of putting 
together a 56.8-million experimental 
package they hope will take them 
back in time to the beginning of the 
universe on one hand and give them 
a glimpse of the end of the world on 
the other. 

The experiment has no fancy 
names. II is known simply as the 
hard X-ray and low energy gamma 
ray experiment. 

Funded by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration, the 700-pound ex-
perimental package will be one of 
four that will comprise the nation's 
first High Energy Astronom ical 
Observatory (HEAD) . 

This pioneering HEAD (there will 
be others in the future) is scheduled 
to be launched April 15, 1977, from 
Cape Kennedy to a 225-mile-high 
earth orbit aboard an Atlas-Centaur 
rocket.

model of the experimental package 
and has just begun work on the 
actual flight model. 

The prototype model, he said, will 
be used on a test flight aboard a 
balloon that will carry it up to about 
120,000 feet from the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research at 
Palestine, Tex., this September. 

The object of the test flight, he 
said, will be to prove the scientific 
and engineering integrity of the 
model system when exposed to 
pressure and temperature conditions 
of space. 

The UCSD experimental package, 
Matteson said, will examine many of 
the known X-ray and gamma-ray 
sources and, hopefully, may detect 
some new ones. 

In 1967, it was discovered that 
there was a pulsar located right in 
the very core of the crab nebula. A 
pulsar is believed to be a rapidly 
spinning neutron star, a tiny but very 
dense residue of the original star. 
The Crab Nebula pulsar emits 
powerful bursts of X-rays and gamma 
rays and others at regular 30 second 
intervals. 

become powerful emitters of both X-
rays and gamma rays. 

Moving out of the galaxy and into 
the vastness of the universe, itself, 
Matteson said the UCSD experiment 
will also take new readings of what is 
termed " background radiation ." 

This phrast! refers to relatively low 
levels of X-ray and gamma radiation 
that seems to come from all 
directions of the universe and is 
spread out uniformly throughout the 
universe. 

It is possible, Matteson sa id, that 
this radiation is Simply the sum of 
radiation from far distant and still 
undiscovered sources at the rim of 
the universe. 

However, he said, it is also 
possible that this radiation 
represents left-over energy resulting 
from the theoretical " big bang" that 
supposedly set our universe into 
motion somewhere around 12 billion 
years ago . 

rt this is true, Matteson said, then 
the information gleaned by the 
UCSD experiment about background 
radiation could help astronomers 
and astrophysicists determine the beyond through hillh-

energy glasses that permit 
him to see more than JlJst 
the visible world.

noted, much of the in-
formation about X-rays and 
gamma rays deals with the 
life cycle of stars. There 
seem to be some sort of 
pattern emerging in thl 
cycle, he Indicated. 

For example, he said thilt 
very large stars-thos with 
masses at least three times 
that of our sun-are very apt 
to co llapse at the end of 
their lives Into black holes 

UCSD's participation in 
this program is gUided by 
Dr . Lawrence Peterson, 
professor of physics and 
principal investigator for 
this experiment with Dr.

James L. Matteson, a research 
physicist and CO-investigator, and 
Robert A . Farnsworth, project 
engineer. 

The package, itself, involves seven 
different sensors arranged in a 
ircular pattern within an aluminllm 

housing . The entire instrument 
measures about 30 inches in 
diameter and 20 inches in depth . 

The sensors are designed to 
measure varying levels of X-ray and 
gamma ray intensities "starting at 
the medical X-ray level and going on 
up," Matteson said . 

The array includes two )(-ray 
sensors that range from 10 to 200 
KEV (a KEV is equal to 1,000 electron 
volts) in energy . The remaining five 
Sensors are gamma ray detectors 
with ranges from 100 to 10,000 KEV. 

Right now, Farnsworth said, the 
UCSD group is about halfway 
through with an initial prototype 

When it was first discovered, it 
was believed that these pulses were 
meaningful signals from another 
intelligent civilization . 

Another object scheduled for 
close scruti ny will be a star 
designated . as Cyg nu s X- l . 
Examination of this star in the last 
few years has led many astronomers 
to believe that it has a dark, un seen 
companion with which it revolves. 

This dark companion, Matteson 
said, may be what is called a "black 
hole," a giant star that has co llapsed 
so completely in on itself that it has 
created a gravitational field so 
strong that nothing- not even light-
can escape from it. 

It is believed, the UCSD phySicist 
said, that this black hole is sucking 
material from Cygnus X-l into its 
invisible maw. As this gaseous 
material falls inward, he said, it 
should reach temperatures ranging 
into the 100 t:n i II ions of degrees. 
Gases at those temperature he said, 

their lives as neutron stars 
or pulsars. 

But stars with approximately the 
same mass as that of our i un, 
Matteson said, seemed destin( j to 
collapse into what are known as 
" white dwarf" stars, small and dense 
objects with just enough nuclear fuel 
left to emit a feeble, cold light. 

The UCSD experiment and the 
enti re HEAO program are designed 
to provide more exact information 
through X-ray and gam mil ray data 
about the nature and future of the 
universe in which we live.

Musical Notes 
continued from page 11 

The album has its ups and downs, and suffers only by 
its stylistic consistancy keeping a lot of it very " haven't I 
heard this before" -ish. But occasional breaks such as 
"Fresh Fruit" , a sort of cute-ish song about the virtues o f 
fruit with a very tropical feel to it, give the album its 
distinction and merit. 

Procol Harum remains a band of unique style which 
makes it always recognizable as nothing but Procol 
Harum and hence you've either got to like what it is 
they do, or not . If you like 'em, you're going to l ike this 
and confident as they've every sounded .
