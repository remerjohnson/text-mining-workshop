SAE Flyer Attacked for 
Portrayal u Wcmen 
.Fraternity says depiction does not represent its 
'general view;' president calls WRC 'uptight' 
By PIIIIIp Mlchl.l. 
StaffWrlter 

A fraternity calendar of events 
has received criticism from mem-
bersofthe Women's ResourceCen-
ter (WRC) who say it contains de-
rogaIory images of women. 

The flyer is a schedule of winter 
quarter events for Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon and was intended to be seen 
only by members of the fraternity .It 
was brought to the WRC by an 
anonynious person offended by its 
cootents. 

In a letter to the WRC, the person 
wrote, "I found this fraternity calen-
dar agenda, and I was shocked by all 
the derogatory images and com-
ments about women. I hope you are 
able to do something to stop this 
perpetuation of objectifying women 
as slaves and disease bearers." 

The flyer contains a drawing of a 

naked woman di playing her va-
gina. In place of the vagina is a 
distorted mouth with teeth. 

Underneath that drawing are the 
words, "Remember: Avoidacancre 
[sic] - wrap it before you crank 
her." 

"We use that to make sure every-
one in our fracernity uses rubbers," 
said Andrew Robinson. social di-
rector for Sigma Alpha Epsilon. 

TIle calendar also contains a 
drawing of two stick figures having 
"doggie-style" intercourse, with the 
male figure grabbing the female fig-
ure by her hair. 

"I think it's sad because this is 
the same fraternity that had a poster 
last year with a woman wrapped 
around a keg. They were forced to 
attend a sensitivity workshop, and

Scripps Research Stalled by Point Loma Sewage Spill 
• Sewage plant employees allege damage caused by human error, experts attribute rupture to 'turbulent conduction' 
By ebecca Toln 
Guardian Reporter 

The Scripps Institution of Oceanography has 
been forced to temporarily halt its research ef-
forts off the Point Lorna coast due to the sewage 
pill from a ruptured underwater pipeline di -

covered on Feb. 2. 
The sewage. leaking 3, 150 feet offshore from 

the Point Lorna outfall pipe, was 80 percent 
treated at the time of the leak, posing minimal 
threat to the ecological community, yet contain~ 
ing high enough counts of fecal colifolTTl bacte-
ria to potentially infect humans with diseases 
like hepatitis and typhoid, according to Mia 
Tegner, a research biologist at SIO who studies 
the disturbance and response patterns of the 
Point Lorna coastal region. 

"We cannot dive because the city has closed 
off the kelp [bed ] to all diving - more ru a 
safety measure than anything else," she said. 

Recent storms have delayed repairs of the 
nine-foot diameter pipe that has already spilled 
over 180 million gallons of sewage, pu hing the 
repair date well into April. Tegnerestimated that 
the ocean's natural motion will disperse the 
effluent in short order, assuming the repairs are 
made quickly. 

Robert Simmons, attorney for the Sierra Oub. 
expressed concern over city plans to mend the 
500 feet of damaged outfall pipe. 

"I'm afraid that the city will take the wrong 
repair measures. What the Sierra Oub believes, 
and I as their attorney believe, is that we need to 
phaseout the outfall pipe and ultimately increase 

to a reclamation level of treatment and increase 
the u e of recycling." 

Simmons said the city's chronic water short-
age could be reduced if the sewage water were put 
to practical uses. such as park watering and fire 
hydrants. 

Kurt Kidman. senior public information offi-
cer at San Diego Water Utilities. said that the pipe 
will be repaired by anchoring the two ends of the 
pipe that are till good using a crane from a 100-
ton barge and replacing the damaged pipe sec-
tions. 

At a press conference Friday. City Manager 
Jack McGrory issued a statement affirming that 
replacement sections of the pipe have been or-
dered and that the barge will remain in pon until

Warren Parking Lot 
To Close March 1st 
By Mary Betty Heard 
News Editor 

Parking lot 504. located behind the Warren College 
apartments, is scheduled to close on Mar. I to allow for the 

. construction of the new Warren College residence halls. 
"I think we 're losing 569 [spaces] when the lot close ." 

said Warren College Resident Advisor Melanie Hom. 
According to Claire Palmer, assistant resident dean of 

Warren College, the lot closure has been fairly well publ i-
cized. "Signs have been up for a while, but I know that 
students have been upset [about the closure]," she said. 

According to Hom, students will be affected "a great 
deal." 

DavId Rex beat the lottery odds by making It to last Saturday's -BIg ""~NI!i"" "That is where a majority of students park." she said, 
adding that all of the spaces which will be removed are

"Commuter students using this lot only have two op-

Fiveplanaemployeesallegedthat 
the spill was a resull of human error. 
One worker said that a diversion 
gate and throttle valve were lICCi-
dentally opened at the same time, 
creating a large burst of air, called a 
"water hammer." which surged 
through the pipes. 

McGrory maintained that the 
rupture was caused by naruraI forces. 
but said that he will not rule out 
other explanations until inspectors 
actually dig up the aging concrete 
pipes. 

"Oui experts still think that the 
most likely theoI)' is that of exces-
sive turbulent conduction," 
McGrory said "But again. [we woo 't 
know 1 wlIil we pull the pipe up and 
have a complete inspection and we 
do inlend to hire an independent 
investigative firm to take a look at 
the whole situation." 

TegOer said she feels that the 
environmental impact of the spill 
has been overplayed. "People have 
been calling this an environmental 
disaster and I think the point is that 
it is a social. poIiticJII and economic 
disaster bul it is no( an environmen-
tal disaster." she said. . 

"II has certainly hun businesses 
whose livelihoods depend upon the

shops and sea urchin fisheries.

going dispute over primary sewage

treatment versus secondary treat-
ment, which was the object of a 

, federal judge's ruling last year re-
quiring the upgrade of San Diego's 
sewage treatment. Secondary treat-
ment of sewage would remove five 
to 15 percent more bacteria than is 
currently removed in advanced pri-
mary treatment. 

Last Tuesday the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) 
put oul an order for the city to up-
grade waste water treatment. The 
EPA also asked the city to use chlo-
rine as an interim disinfecting mea-
sure following last year's ruling. 
According to a Los Angeles Times 
report, the city of San Diego has 
refused to take either of these mea-
sures. 

Teper said she feels that this 
billion-dollar upgrade would be 
costly and insigniflCatll "If we had 
bcenatsecondary treatment. il would 
not have made any difference. I do 
not believe this is a wise use of 

money," she said. 
Simmons advocates a physical-

chemical method of treatment for 
the sewage, currently being tested. 
that he says will make an upgmde 
occur sooner and more cheaply. 

The MarineLife Research Group 
at Scripps is trying to assess any 
potential toxic effects to the marine 
envirorunent. 

Tegner and Dr. Paul Dayton. a 
professor of Marine Ecology al 
UCSQ, warned that present kelp 
growth could be jeopardized if the 
sewage 0 ankets the bottom of the 
ocean or considerably reduces light

However, previous d isturbances

"The message here is that the kelp

A Trade War is the Last Thing We Want 
By M ..... Lee 
Contributing OpInion Writer 

Recent comments made by 
top Japanese officials regarding 
the American work ethic have 
sparlced anti-Japanese sentiment 
throughout the nation. Japan-
bashing is on the rise once 
again. promoting a resurgence in 
American patriotism. According 
to the Los A/lgeles Times, a 
Michigan Circuit Court Judge 
let a would-be-suspended driver 
off the hook solely with the 
assurance that he would drive an 
American car. The "Buy 
American" campaigns that have 
suddenly sprouted across the 
country are the American 
response to insults hurled at 
American workers by the 
Japanese. Many members of the

is Japan. It was only a matter of 
time before our friends from the 
Far East became the deserving 
recipients of our righteous 
loathing. 

Look at what they've done-
good products at a low cost, 
increased productivity and a 
suong individual work ethic. 
Why, the ungrateful basIards were 
just asking for it. And after all the 
things we've done for them-
Hiroshima and internment camps 
to name but two. -

It's all well and good to paint 
Japan as the sinister hobgoblin 
that's been letting the air out of 
our economy's tires. but that 
avoids the real issue. Japan is a 
leading economic power because 
it stresses imovatian. effICiency. 
and maximizing output while 
minimizing cost. American 
indusIry is on the slide for exactly 
the opposite mISOOS. We make 
expensive stuff' IhIl nobody WIllIS 
IDd thal falls apen after the 
warrw1Iy expires, anyhow.

Asian-American community, 
particularly Japanese-Ameri-
cans, have received hate mail 
and been subjected to threats and 
vandalism. 

Many label the rising 
tensions between the United 
States and Japan an economic 
trade war. Some even go so far 
as to refer to it as a war between 
two nations that never really 
ended in 1945. Although tmde 
relations with Japan have been 
on the decline. Talceo Hoshi , an 
assistant professor of Japanese 
economics at UCSD. doesn't see 
current relations with Japan as 
an economic or trade war 
because "each country is gaining 
something. With trade. both 
sides win somehow." 

However. whereas the Bush 

pay. Unfortunately, they've all 
been laid off by General Motors. 

Americans are not lazy. Easily 
satisfied and overly confident, 
perhaps. but not lazy. 

The problem here is one of 
goals. American industry' s goals 
are so shon-sighted, they border 
on myopia. American business is, 
for the most pan, solely concerned 
with producing the largest profits 
possible. and if that means 
sacrificing quality, employees and 
ethics. c' est /a vie. 

When profits drop. there's no 
innovation or adaptation. only 
layoffs and comer cutting. But 
executive salaries mnain com-
pletely intact. Even though their 
companies are experiencing tough 
times, CEOs are still raking in 
million dollar salaries. Back in 
Sunday School. we called people 
like this "hypocrites." The folks in 
unemployment lines use less 
polite words. 

You would thinIt that all this 
might cause some serious soul 
SCIIIdlina IIIDOIlg corporate 
executives. B .. taking a critical 
look at the goals of busineu 
would require too much thought 
from our capI8ins of indusIry. So 
like a spoiled kid b)'ing 10 dodge

favoriee vae,1hey paint the 
innoceat ~ alhe cuIpri&. 

Administration previou ly 
remained distant toward the 
concept of managed trade, 
Hoshi sees a trend in the U.S. 
trade policy toward managed 
trade, which entails govern-
ment intervention. Hoshi 
argues that managed trade is 
one of the detrimental ele-
ments of social planning. 
which he say does not work, 
as seen in what used to be the 
Soviet Union. 

As much as there is Japan-
bashing in the United States, 
there is anti-American speech 
and sentiment in Japan . 
"Saturday Night Live's" recent 
portrayal of "America-
bashing." although exceed-
ingly exaggerated, may not be 
too far from reality. 

TIle minute the economy began to 
head south, American business 
was laying the blame on those 
nna!evolent. ~unlaOCJapanese 
types. By doing this, we save 
ourselves the trouble of having to 
come up with a solution. 

Michael Moore. whose film 
"Roger & Me" described the 
greed and short-sightedness that 
ride shotgun with American 
industry, once said "You never 
hear the White Sox saying, 'Oh. 
we don't want to play the A's. 
1bey're too good' If you want to 
compete. play better baseball. 
Suild better cars." 

While Japan is producing Sony 
Trinitron TVs, we're chuming out 
Thighmasters by the dozem. Simply 
put. their stuff is beaer than ours. 
And all the Japm-bashing in the 
world isn't going 10 change that 

Fair trade and a stronger 
economy aren't going to be 
brought about by protectionist 
policies or flying the president to 
Japan to beg every couple of 
months. A change is only going to 
come when American indUSby re-
evaluates itself ani realizes that its 
present course of action has mired 
the economy smack dab in the 
swamp. 

Sut until that time comes. at 
least we still make better stuff

the world. And there was this 
crazy idea called the "American 
Dream" where, with a linle hard 
work. you could own a house 
right next to Ozzie and Harriet 
Nelson, a car, have your 2.5 kids 
and live the good life ... 

Remember those days? I don't 
- I grew up during the "rape and 
pillage" decade known as the '80s. 

Things were a 10( different -
big lime. Many large cotpomlions 
made it a standard practice to 
incur large debts to buyout 
competitors, to tave off hostile 
takeovers or to make money 
playing the stock.s. These rape and 
pillage companies no longer 
valued the idea of u ing money to 
increase the companies' competi-
tivene in the long-run. In tead. 
they were only interested in 
making a quick buck. 

These rape and pillage 
companies no longer valued 
making their money the old-
fashioned way. and they no longer 
valued their workers. What are 
workers anyhow. but numbers to 
be manipulated? What did these 
companies do when they needed 
quick cash to help payoff the 
massive debt from their paper 
deals? They raided pension funds. 
They closed perfectly good 
factorie ,sold the assets, laid off 
workers - and moved them to 
foreign countries. All standard 
"rape and pillage" business 
practice. 

While American businesse 
were playing the stocks game, the 
Japanese were busting their asses 
making their money the old-
fashioned way - by mOllufoctur-
ilfg a product that consumers 
would want 10 buy. The Japanese 
used their money to find bener 
way to put that product together. 
They look.ed for ways to increase 
their competitiveness. 

Suddenly, many U.S. compa-
nies found they couldn 't compete 
in the marketplace with Japanese 
companies. They said that the 
Japanese weren't playing fair. 
And now that times are tough and 
Americans are looking for 
someone to blame, these U.S. 
companies expect us to believe 
it's the fault of·the Japanese. 

The Japanese have done more 
to prop up our economy than the 
folks in Congress have. Did you 
know that without Japanese 
investors buying Treasury Bills 
our economy would be in worse 
shape than it is now? Or that the 
average Japanese consumer 
spends more money on American 
products than Americans spend on 
Japanese products? 

The "Suy American" move-
ment isn't about patriotism. 
'Anyone who believes that racism 
can be patriotic is pathetic. And 
that's exactly what this Japan-
bashing is: really pathetic. 

The Japanese aren't taking 
away jobs in the automotive 
industry; American CEOs are. 
Their short-sighted mismanage-
ment and greed ruined their 
companies' competitiveness. 

And we're supposed to feel 
sony for them, and buy an 
American cat! No way. 

The Japanese didn ' t create the 
federal defICit, the politicians we 
elected into offICe did. And they 
chose to ignore il

thing." said JeMifer Daneck of the 
WRC. 

Sigma Alpha Epsilon came un-
der fire in Fall Qwuter. 1990 for 
having a rush poster which depicted 
a semi·naked woman straddling a 
keg. 

"It's called 'they never team.· " 
said WRC member MoUy McKay. 

".t seems as if there are more and 
more events held at women's ex-
pense. I wish they could move be-
yond that because there are frattmi-
ties that do some good things," 
McKay added. 

Members of Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon have responded that the WRC 
has no bu iness criticizing them for 
their calendar. 

"It's none of their business. If 
they wnnt to make a fuss, they can go 
ahead and do it It doesn't bother 
us." said Robinson. 

According to SAE President

"We have had no allegations 
made against us of nny impropriety 
or misconduct ever," Ager added. 

Sigma Alpha Epsilon'scalendar

"lbe picture doesn't represent

McKay also cited a "slave auc-

of February as evidence of SAE's

"For me. [a slave auctionl con-

moments in American hi!ltory." ~he 
added. 

According to Robinson, the , lave 
auction i. neither insensitive nor a 
racial lur. 

"We have minorities in our fra-
temity, and they weren't offended 
by it, " said Robinson. 

Ager said that the WRC' allega-
tions are mostly based on an anti-
fratemity bias. 

". wonder if the WRC is making 
a stink about any of the things the 
Koala produces_ They single frater-

McKay said. however, that

After bein& rained out in •

Redlands. the UCSD women's 
tennis learn is Iookina forwud to

all to be played on the Muir Col-
lege courts. this week. 

On Tuesday, the Tritons play 
host to Wesbnonl <;011ege II 3 
p.m. 

AJthough the Warriors are in 
the NAlA and not the NCAA, 
UCSD Head Coach Liz LaPlante 
is still expecting a tough match. 

LaPlanle thinks thai the match 
with Westmont will give the Tri-
tons some good competition in 
preparation for their big match 
againsl Pomona-Pitzer on Friday, 
which will be one of UCSD' 
toughest matches of the season. 

The Sagehens and the Tritons 
are twoofthebest teams in Divi-
ion ill women' tennis. 

The two squads have repre-
sented the Western Region in na-
tionals for the past five or ix 
years. according to LaPlante. 

LaPlante believes that the Tri-
tons can take advanlage of the 
Sagehens' loss of their number 

four .... five sinatcs players. 
"1be only way we can bell 

Pomona is with our deplh," 
LaPIae said. 

The TrilDl1l' number four lAd

ofwhom have played weD forthe

In other malCh-ups. the Tri-

Robyn InIba, will play Shelley

will be • IOIi8h one for Inaba • 
Keeler is one of the top-ranked 
players in Division m .... hits 
the bell excepcionally bud. 

Carla Nicolas, UCSD's num-
ber two singles player and a strict 
baselincr, will play theSaaehens' 
Erin Hendricks. According to 
LaPlante, Nicolas' steady and 
level-headed play will help her 
againsl the sometimes inconsis-
tent Hendriclcs. 

"We hope (Carla's] consis-
tency and mcntaltoughncss will 
pull her through, ,. LaPlante said. 

Last year, the Tritons went I-
I againsl the Sagehens. 

The match with Pomona-
Pitzer is scheduJed for 2 p.m. 

Finally, on Saturday, the Tri-
tons will take on Clarcmont Col-
lege. 

The Stags are not • women's 
temis powerhouse. and LaPlante 
expects the Tritons to win the 
match. 

That match is set for 11 a.m.

The next nisht. the Tritons faced 
what they thought would be a stiffer 
test in the Menlo Oaks. 

"b was kind of a swprise ... said 
Marshall, "We didn't play well in 
the first half. We were slow. very 
lethargic." 

The Tritons had a nine poinllcad 
at the half, 37-26, but MarshaI1 was 
not happy. After a few words to his 
troops, UCSD swted the second 
half on fire. 

Using. smothering defense and 
machine-gun offense, the Tritons 
opened the second half with a 23'() 
run. The Oaks were unable to score 
until 7:20 had elapscd in !he half, 
and II one point. UCSDwason.37-

"We just went into the second 
half knowing thal we had to set the 
tone for the playoffs, and that half 
sure did it for us." said Marshall. 

By the time it was over. every 
Triton had scored for !be second

while Johnson put in 13 and Spence 
had 10. Duvin Jacbon had fun in 
his role as poi .. guard. dishing out 
nine assisIs to' eager teammates. 

Marshall found Drake to be a 
pleasant surprise. "He's playing 
more now, and he's malUng the 
most of those minutes. He's doing. 
lot of things for us. because we play 
him II the rhrce-man spoc but ihcn 
rocate him inside because he's so 
aggressive on the boards. .. 

Despite the perfonnance of the 
team without Swindall. the coach 
knows lhaI the Tritons will be miss-
ing the big man down the. stretch, 

especially during playoff time. 
"[Swindall's] such. force inside 

that wc wiD miss him. lot. Plus, the 
further you go in the playoffs, the

very far having to play your Slalters 
37 or 38 minutes a gune. You can 
never have enough depth. "Maushall 
said. 

With his third-ranked team in 
seemingly great fonn, Marshall is 
Wldcrsaandably optimistic &bout the 
fuJUre. '1'his was a greaI weekend

Even to the very end, it seems

Or maybe it was a spon thal took 
a young man's furious energies and 
channeled them under the guise of 
competition, until not even the thrill 
of a connecting uppercut could 
quench Tyson's thirst for destruc-
tion. 

In any event, Mike Tyson' s c0n-

~~ Tritons Keep On RoIli~w~~!~to~~~~ 
Kid Dynamite, San 
Spital and the Shark 

J UST A FEW NOTES: •. Mike Ty~'s meteoric. nse to promlllence and hiS 
nearly unbelievable faU from 
grace have 10 mark one of the 
rockiest, most turbulent periods in 
the history of sport. It seems like 
eons, but it was only seven years 
ago that Tyson was a 19-year old 
phenom dubbed "Kid Dynamite" 
by the folks at Sports Illustrated. 

In an almost unprecedented 
manner, word spread like wildfire 
about a ferocious young boxer 
who thundered into the ring 
wearing just black horls and 
black shoes; aboul a slugger who 
suffocated his opponents under a 
blitzkrieg of hooks, jabs and 
roundhouse rights; about an angry 
young man who took minute , not 
round , to di pose of his oppo-
nents. 

At the time, it seemed like 
Mother Goose had once again 
pun a fairy tale for athletic . Here 

was a juvenile delinquent who had 
been rescued from the streets, 
given direction by an omery, old 
trainer named Cu D'Amato, and 
was finally gett ing a taste of 
success. 

T tiE SPORnNG aficionado couldn ' t help but be 
intrigued . .. the methodical 
madness with which Tyson 
brutally wiped out his opponents, 
the manner in which he stalked 
through the ring, the reports of a 
teenager so in touch with his sport 
that he locked himself in a room 
and studied film after film of the 
sport 's greats.

UCSD Can't 
Keep Up With 
Roadrunners 
• Tennis open season 
with a 6-3 loss to 
Division II Bakersfield 
8y Blair Ridley 
Staff Writer 

On Thursday afternoon, the 
UCSDrnen's tennis team opened 
its season on the wrong foot with 
a loss against Oivsion U foe Cal 
State Bakersfield. 

In an attempt to avenge last 
year's 5-1 loss to the Roadrun-
ners, the Triton , ranked fifth in 
Division m. could once again 
muster only one win in singles, 
resulting in a 6-3 defeat. 

Five of the six Triton singles 
players took their opponents to 
three sets, before losing in the 
final set. 

whips Dominican and Menlo to reach 2O-win mark 
ByGnlClw .... 
Associate Sports Editor 

Okay, let's pretend you're the 
UCSD men' s basketball team. 

You've just lost a key starter, a 
man whose size and strength are 
pivota.l to the success of your game 
plan. N~w, let's say that you have 
two road games coming up, the sec-
Ond of which is against a team that is 
already bigger than you are. WhaJ 
do you do? 

You go out and win the games by 
an average of 40 points. Ho hum. 
Just another day at the offICe. 

ThaI's exactly what the Tritons 
(20-4) did this weekend, traveling 
to the Bay Area for games against 
Dominican on Friday and MenIo on 
Saturday. 

Despite the absence of Andy 
Swindall, UCSD routed Dominican 
109-70, and then dealt Menlo a 91 -
50 drubbing the next night. The 
victories brought the cumnl win 
streak to 15 games, tying the school 

record. 
Against the Penguins, the 'fri-

tons were able to do anything they 
wanted to. "We played really well, 
from start 10 finish on Friday," said 
Head Coach Tom Manihall. "We 
went out and executed what we 
needed to do." 

UCSD had five players in double 
figures for the game, w,ith John 
Spence leading the way with 21 
points. Chris Moore added 16points 
while Erik Johnson and Joey Drake 
had 1.5 apiece. Rick Batt had 14 of 
his own. 

The game marked the first time 
this season that eve!}' Triton scored. 

Ball was also the leading 
rebounder for the Tritons, grabbing 
nine boards while Drake was able to 
pull down seven. As a team, UCSO 
shut the Dominican rebounders 
down, taking 46 boards to the Pen-
guins' 23.

Women Win 
Two More 
• Defensive effort is key 
in two-victory weekend 
ByGrea Wrenn 
Associate Sports Editor . 

After getting off to a disappoint-
ing start, the women's basketball 
team is finally getting it together. 

The Tritons posted two more 
victories over the weekend, making 
it four wins in a row and raising their 
record to 13-8 on the season. 

Playing at home on Friday, 
UCSD triumphed over the Univer-
sity of Redlands, 57-42. 

"We played pretty well," said 
Head Coach Judy Malone, "Our 
defense, especially, was able to shut 
them down. " 

That defensive effort was the 
biggest factor in the win for the 
Tritons. 

And then suddenly, it all came 
tumbling down. 1be moment I 
remember as the point at which 
his fast track started to derail is 
O'Amato's death. It triggered a 
furious battle to gain control of 
this man, this commodity, who 
would eventually be wonh $30 
million every time he tepped in 
the ring.

He was Mike Ty on. Iron Mike

D' AMATO'S DEATH was like a train reaching the peak of a 
mountain. From there it was all 
downhill. The Disasler Express 
gained speed rapidly. barely

failed marriage, countless run-ins

Golf stays Unbeaten 
With Win Over CSUDH 
• UCSD hands Division 
II Toms a 302-312 loss 
By Grea Wrenn 
Associate Sports Editor 

The Triton golf team improved 
its record to 5-0 with an impressive 

' 302-312 win over Division n Cal 
State Dominguez Hills Friday. 

The match took place in Palos 
Verdes at the Toros' home course, 
Los Verdes, a 6,650-yard, par-7l 
duffers paradise. 

The medalist for the match was 
. ' UCSD's Man Stottem, who shot an 

eye-cpcning dJree..over-par 74. 
Amidst their five-match win 

streak, the Tritons have accumu-
lated a 129 shot advantage over 
their opponents. 

Head Coecb Mike Wydra was 

thrilled withhisteam 's perfonnance. 
"The fact that we could take them on 
their home course speaks well for 
us, especially without our number 
one player [Dale Abrahaml," said 
Wydra. 

Other low scores were turned in 
by UCSD's freshman sensation Pete 
Roberts an Jeremy Moe who both 
shot a 75. 

Wydra is now looking forward 
to the retum of Abraham, who is stiU 
recovering from knee surgc:ty. He 
should be back golfing for the Tri-
tons in time for the Mar. 2 match at 
Loyola Marymount. 

Wydra is impressed with his 
team's perfOl'llllRCe 50 far, and is 
confident thaa they will only get 
better. "Watch out for the Tritons,"

the state-of-the-art sound system. 

It began as a "hairbal.l idea," that originated 
during Wintress and VickJand's trip to Europe in 
November of 1990. The original idea was just to 
build the recording studio. However. there was a 
portion of the building thai wasn't being used, and 
the pair developed the idea of the coffee house. 

"The cafe was an afterthought, " Vickland says. 
Win tress , primary project was the studio, so 
VickJand took control of the cafe Given the chance 
to try a new and challenging objective, she left the 
job she got after gradualiilg from UCSD in 1990. 

"The all-around decision for me was that it was 
an opportunity to gel out of a job I didn't like, for a 
company I didn't respect," VickJand says. Three 
months after the opening of the coffee house, she 
says, "It's exci.ting being my own boss and learning 
everything myself." 

'The coffee house has started to "develop a 
personality of its own," as VickJand says. There are

ing studio in the back room, but the basic setting 
brings a distinct character. TIle high vaulted ceiling

"We' re a well-kept secret," Wintress says, but 
business has been improving teadily. Once the 
studio is completely operational, by the end of 
Winter, the caf~'s popularity ought to grow even 
more. 

"There is a new energy, an excitement," Wintress 
says. "The mystery of recording, and the ani tic 
atmosphere that accompanies it." 

Both Wintress and VickJand were heavily 
involved in the cooperatives while they were 
students at UCSD. Wintress was one of the found-
ing members of the Grove Caffe and worked at the 
Che Cafe. As part of the Food Co-op, VickJand 
gained "confidence and practical experience in 
business as well as working with people:· 

Friends from UCSD have been very supponive 
of the couple's venture into the business world. This 
support is not limited solely to students - Revelle 
Provost lbomas Bond recently vi ited with his 
family for a cup of joe. 

As it becomes more well-known, the cafe begins 
to attract more than just the local Solana Beach residents. 
"It is becoming a home away from home in the 
community ," Wintress says. 

Although many patrons find themselves 
attracled 10 the music, there realJy is no 

particular age group thai frequents Studio 
101. College students, professionals, 

musicians, arti ts and others, ranging 
from ages 17 to 60, all enjoy the 

cafe. It is also finding itself a 

stop on bicycling trips along the coast 
One of the main purposes of me recording studio 

is to draw musicians from other parts of the country, 
particularly Los Angeles. Wintress classifies it as a 
"resort studio," in contrast to ones in large industrial 
cities. Studio 101 is a few minutes' walk from the 
beach. Musician can spend time in between 
recording sessions at the beach, hanging out in the 
cafe or making the shOJ1trek into San Diego. He 
compares this with a common record label practice 
of sending bands to remote locations to record so 
thatmey can concentrate and not be hassled with the 
fru trations of everyday city life. 

"Bands like Mary's Danish and others of similar 
caliber would be perfect," Wintress says, but he 
hopes the tudio and cafe will also build on the local 
music scene. Part of the reasoning behind the studio 
was to make available a place where local bands can 
record at a reasonable rate. 

In addition, a coUection of local compact disc is 
being marketed in the cafe for listeners to become 
involved with local music. Wintress intends to limit 
the collection to local bands to help enhance the San 
Diego music scene, which has seen a rise in recent 
years. Over time, he hopes to build the largest 
library of local music in the county. 

1be high-arched ceiling above the studio has 
given rise to the term "performance loft," Studio 
101 supports local music bands by giving them a 
chance to play at the loft. Bordenown played last .. 
Wednesday and in the near future Peter Sprague will 
perform. The loft is set up recital-style, seating 35. 
For a minimal charge, patrons can enjoy up-and-
coming San Diego musicians in an intimate 
environment. 

As for the actual studio, Wintress thinks it wiU be 
one of "the tinest in San Diego County, as weU as 
being the only coastal facility of its versatility and 
character south of Santa Monica. It 'U offer high-
quality analog and digital work in a very comfol1-
able environment. " 

Services offered include 24-track recording and 
mixing, audio post-production and video lockup, 
layback, DA T duplication, editing and assembly, 
CD mastering, premastering, a MIDI production 

facility and cassette duplication. Access to 
engineers and musical equipment is also 

available at the studio. 
Neither Winlress nor Vickland 

knows what direction Studio 101 
will follow. Both are optimistic and 
look forward to prospering in the 
music industry and coffee house 
scene in San Diego, but Vickland 
adds, "We've learned how to let 
the place evolve. We have our 
ideas and fantasies, but in no 
means are we in tola! control."
