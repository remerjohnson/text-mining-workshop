TUSC Represents Close-Knit Group 
by Wade Chandler 

If there is any feeling at 
UCS D that the Un-
derg raduate Student 
Counci I (TUSC) represents 
all the undergraduate 
students at UCSD, an in-
vestigation by the Triton 

OMMENTARY 

election process was one 
of dynamic consensus, with 
no formal votes being 
taken . Since there were 
about as many positions to 
be filled as there were 
volunteers to fill them, in 
most cases the office 
seekers were able to work 
out among themselves any 
conflicts over who would 
get a particular posision . 

Two of the current Muir 
College representatives to 
TUSC were selected in this 
manner. The third is a 

recent replacement who 
was appointed by the Muir 
College Council. This 
choice by the MCC was 
made following the un-
successful town hall 
meetings of February 19 
and 21 . Attendance at these 
meetings, in spite of heavy 
publicity, was about a 
dozen persons, of which 
five were the members of 
the council.

Friedkin Nontinated As 
New Revelle Provost 

The Chancellor's office 
has announced the 
f'I"mination of Biology 
professor Morris Friedkin as 
provost of Revelle College, . 
subject to the approval of 
the UC regents . 

Friedkin would replace 
Dr. Muarry Goodman, who 
filled the post temporarily 
when Vice-chancellor Paul 
Saltman left Revelle to take 
his present position . 

The Revelle Provost 
Search Committee, a 
student-f<\culty group, 
originally nominated Dr. 
June' Tap, a professor of 
psychology at the 
University of Minnesota. 
Tap declined the 
nomination for family 
reasons . 

The Search committee 
was not consulted on the 
choice of Friedkin, Saltman 
said, because "we wanted 
to have an appointment 
before the Regents as soon 
as possible ." Tap notified 
UCSD of her plans not to 
take the job two and a half 
weeks ago. 

Saltman added that 
Friedkin had been on the 
original list of prospects, 
but was dropped because of 
injuries suffered in a July, 
1973 automobile accident. 
He was nominated after 
UCSD Med School doctors 
said he would be able to 
assume the post. 

According to Saltman, 
Tap's nomination had been 
an attempt to bring Revelle 
College away from the strict 
scientific image it holds. 
" She is an extraordinarily 
distinguished scholar and 
teacher," he said, adding 
that it would have been 
desirable to get a woman 
into a high administrative 
position . 

Friedkln, a professor of 
biology, was described by 
Saltman to the San Diego 
Union as a "humanist who 
also happen s to do 
science" He told the Triton 
Times that he feels Friedkl n 
will " move effectively and 
well" in non science 
disciplines 

The nominee said he 
hopes to stab ilize the 
enrollment of Revelle , 
commenting that expansion 
at UCSD would be better at 
Third and Fourth Colleges. 
" I think the major problem 
at any university today is 
the detrimental effect of a 
large student body and a 
small facu lty I'd like to 

bnng them (~ tudent~ and 
faculty member~ ) togethN 
In a relationship that goe~ 
beyond the large lecture 
hall ," he said 

Fnedkln cam to UCSD In 
1969 from the Tufts 
UniverSity School of 
Medicine, where he served 
for a time as head of the 
biology d partmcnt He ha~ 
also taught at the medical 
schoo l at Wa shington 
University . 

He received Bachelor's 
and Master's degrees from 
Iowa I).tate University , 
obtaining a doctorate In 
biochemistry from the 
University of Chicago 

"Compete like Hell " 

Lakoff, Shapiro 
Visit; Cite 'Poachers' 

by Roberta Rehm 

"There are a lot of 
poachers on the Political 
Science domain at this 
university. We are just 
going to compete like 
hell ," sai d Sanford 
Lakeoff , now awaiting 
approval by the U.c. 
Regents as head of the 
new Political Science 
Department. 

concerned with un-
dergraduate education . 
We're not going to hire 
anyone who is not a good 
undergraduate teacher." 

Last week Lakoff and 
Shapiro helped to set up 
requ i rements for the 
major in P.S. which will be 
offered for the first time 
next year. Requirements 
are a freshman sequence 
in political science, (P.S. 
10, 11 , 12), a two quarter 
senior sequence and ten 
additional quarter length 
courses in the department. 

Times indicates that such 
feeling is ill conceived. 
TUSC actually represents 
only a very small, closely 
inte rrelated group of 
students. Representation of 
the student body as a whole 
exists only indirectly, where 
it exi ts at all. If TUSC is 
indeed a student govern-
ment, then it mus,t be 
classed as an oligopoly, 
not a democracy. 

CEP Meeting for Grade Proposal I lakoff 

Lakoff and Shapiro 
stressed that for the next 
two years they wi II be 
most concerned With 
organizing the new 
department . "Real hiring 
can't begin - until next 
year," said Shapiro. Lakoff 
added, " We have a pretty 
good group to start with 
and we're going to build 
on that," According to 
Shapiro, "There will be a 
fair amount 01 interaction 
between students and 
administration in setti ng 
up the department . To the 
extent that you are for-
thcoming, you will be 
listened to ." 

To see why this is so, 
consider first the structure 
of TUSC, which can perhaps 
best be described as that of 
a joint sub-committee . 
None of the members of 
TUSC were chosen in a 
popular election; they ~ere 
all selected by various other 
campus organizations . 
There are three 
representatives from each 
of the colleges at UCSD, 
and one representative 
from each " recognized 
ethnic minority" on 
campus . To be recognized 
apparently means to have 
an organization, so 
representatives are ac Â· 
cepted from the Black 
)tudents Union the Asian-
America n 'Students 
Alliance, MECHA, and the 
United Native Americans. 
However, MECHA and UNA 
are not currently sending 
represe ntatives to TUSC 
meetings. 

During the late spring 
and early fall of 1973 a 
series of " town hall 
meetings" was held at Muir 
College. Attendance was 
omewhcre in the neigh-

borhood of 30 to 40 
students . Out of these 
meetings evolved the 
repre entatives from Muir 
College to various com-
mittees and organizations 
Including the Muir Collea~ 
Council and ruse. The

The Committee on 
Educational Policy (CEP) 
will hold an open meeting 
Thursday in Rm. 2250 Muir 
Campus, for students and 
faculty to give recom-
mendations and air 
opinions on the CEP's 
grading proposal. 

The action resulted from 
a direction by the 
Academic Senate, April 30, 
for the CEP to "seek ap-
propriate consultation with 
the students." 

The main features of the 
proposal are the plus (+1 
minus (-) suffices, each 
holding .33 grade points per 
unit (CPU), and the " In 

Progress" grade. 
At the CEP meeting last 

Friday, that group removed 
the .33 GPU restriction on 
the A plus grade, allowing 
an A plus to hold 4.33 CPU . 

A feature to permit class 
change to P/ NP through the 
sixth week was discussed, 
but nothing definitive was 
decided. 

Primary interest of the 
CEP in the open meeting is 
according to Dr . L. 
Newmark, CEP Chairperson, 
"to find out if this proposal 
is an improvement over the 
present system." He .said 
the CEP will also accept 
written recommendations 
or opinions from students 
and faculty or groups 

'Throat' Showing Opposed 
by David Cassidy 

Despite efforts by the Campus Crusa~e to halt its 
IhowinB, the controvenial movie Deep Throat was 
shown 101 It Saturday night. One source told the Triton 
Times that the Campus Crusade and the Inter.v~nity 
Christian Fellowship offered $700 to the Sea Deucen, 
who sponsored the movie, to halt the showinR of the 
pomoBraphic movie. 

Paul Tramer, the President of the Sea Deucers 
UCSD's divinR club said, "that the re~son for showinR 
the movie was to raise money for new equipment for 
club memben." Even with the voiced opposition and 
a handinR out of pamphlets by memben of the 
Crusade, the movie Rrosled an estimated $4,000. 

The viewen had mixed reactions to the movie. 
Some comments were, "I thoulht it was borinR and 
monotonous," and, "I choke swallowinl pills". Yet 
another person said, "1 thouRht it wal a deep movie". ' 

The Campus Crusade feell, ''it was inhum~n, 
exploitive, and contrary to Jesus' concept of human 
M.ullty. " 

thereof . " Recom -
mendations," Newmark 
aid, " may be submitted at 

the open meeting on 
Thursday night or at the 
Academic Senate office on 
Matthews. Camp'Js." 

Speaking specifically of 
the plus minus feature, Dr. 
Newmark said, "This is a 
way of preserving the 
meaning of grades, and it 
protects the student . A high 
B student who could not get 
an A, can now get a B plus, 
and obtain additional credit 
for it. The gain is greater 
than the corresponding 
loss." 

The " 1 n Progress" grade 
will permit a course to be 
scheduled for more than 
one quarter. Dr. Newmark 
told the Triton Times, " it 
allows for flexibility and 
expansion in course of-
ferings ." He cited field 
study cou rses as an 
example. 

Newmark al 0 said that 
part of the i sue seem to be 
student participation . 
"There was no blockage of 
student input," according 
to Newmark, " the tudents 
have a repre entatlve, 
Charle Krohn , it wa up to 
him to let the other 
tudent know if that' what 

they wanted " 
Dr Newmark sp aking 

further aid, " 1 think It 
would be bett r to let the 
faculty de Ide, generally, 
the better chool are wh r_ 
the faculty make the 
decision or wher they ar 
controlled by the faculty ." 

Lakoff and Dr. Martin 
Shapiro, who will also join 
the P.S. Department next 
year, spoke to a group of 
undergraduates about 

' their plans for the 
department. He cited the 
History and Urban and 
Rural Studies Departments 
as " poachers" and said 
that there are some areas 
in the three disciplines 
that overlap. 

If approved by the 
Regents at their meeting 
next week, Lakoff wi II 
come to UCSD in 
December of this year, in 
time for next winter 
quarter. He is currently on

Turn Off the Water 

Between the V A Hospital and the medical school, at 
one time or another in the shadow of both, sit ten long, 
identical wooden buildings, their windows mostly 
boarded and their paint almost gone. Not many people 
walk by them, because there is no place to go on the 
other side that would cause someone to walk by from 
campus, except perhaps the Bank of America. 

All around the place the tumbleweeds and the pink 
and yellow flowers of the ice-plant have taken over 
again, and the grass grows as high as it wants to 

The buildings once were barracks for the Marine base 
for which Matthew's Campus was named. If you can 
manage not to look up at the two monoliths towering on 
either side, the setti ng will make you feel a little 
timeless; the kind of sensation that comes from being in 
a place whose purpose is lost. There are paths still, and 
though they are overgrown and unused, because they 
no longer go anywhere, I could almost imagine the neat 
rows of green-clad men, about as old as tho e who go to 
school here now, marching along, counting each step 
out loud, looking nowhere but ahead . It was an Image 
strong enough to blot out, for a moment, the one of the 
medical buildings. 

When I finished indulging myself in irony, I started to 
explore around and between the barracks, looking in 
windows and such . The university, apparently, uses 
them for storage, because there were boxes of magnetic 
tape, air conditioning units, and all sorts of stray parts 
and tubes . The doors were locked, but enough of the 
windows were either broken or uncovered to give me 
some idea of what was inside. 

Then I found that the UCSD Recycling Center ha~ its 
headquarters in one of the buildings, a realization that 
took away some of the thrill of having found something 
unknown, or at least something no one else was paying 
much attention to. 

The center is in what appears to have been the 
bathroom for the group of barracks-I could see where 
the sinh and mirrors had been bolted to the wall , on 
which were stenciled the words "TURN OFF THE 
WATER ." 

I remembered having read that men in boot camp 
have to watch movies on how to brush one's teeth , and I 
wondered whether the particular soldier standing in 
what would be the " newspapers" section of the UCSD 
recycling center had brushed his teeth the Marine 
Corps' way, or his way. I couldn't decide. 

I met my friend while I was examining what used to 
be a big, communal shower stall . He was standing 
out ide, watching me through the ooen door, and was a 
big , swayback cat, the kind of cat you would expect to 
be living in a deserted bunch of Marine barracks. After 
we had considered each other for a few moments, my 
first step in hi~ direction sent him scurrying off, to slip ' 
under one of the buildings just as I came outside . 

I was caught up in the thri II of the chase, creeping 
about between the buildings, now noticing that there 
were cat prints near the sides of all the buildings . This 
was the cat's territory . 

I had hoped that he woulc;l at least be on guard for me 
for a whil e, but when I em rged from between two 
buildings, he was carelessly walking away, most likely 
bor('d And when he looked over his shoulder at me, his 
('xrress ion sent me, obedient , back up th hill

The evenl of Winne's immolation, however, went 
unreported in most news media. The more spec-
tacular turbulence of mass demonstralions occurin&. 
across the country in Ihe wa1e of the Kent State 
shootings and the invasion of Camboaia claimed 
precedence over Winne's individual act. 

Granted, Winne's act probably did nothing to end 
the war in Vietnam, but in his act of immolation he 
made himself a symbol of the anguish grippin~ 
AmenÂ·ca. Rarely are people wtlling to act upon theIr 
own, yet Winne was unafraid to do so, unlille so 
many who are unable to thi"k or act without the 
support or anonymity of the mass either behi"d or 
around them. Winne, unprotected by the anonymity 
of the mass, reaffirmed the . spin't of individual 
thought and action. 

The collective acts of masses may ultimately cause 
change to occur, yet it is in the actions of individuals 
where the moral conscience to cause change is 
initially raised. If is this power of the individual to 
stir conscience which we should recall and honor on 
this day . May we be as brave . 

.------------The Co.ndidates -------------, 
Styron for Senate: 
No Military, CIA 

by Chris Rauber 
The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) candidate for Alan 

Cranston's U.S. Senate seat, Dan Styron, was unable to 
attend a scheduled talk at U.C.S.D. last week due to 
illness, but the SWP program was discussed by his 
campaign committee's chairperson, Mark Schneider. 

Schneider said that Styron's " main qualification for 
the office is the program he stands on ." He also em-
phasized Styron's activities in the past decade as an 
anti-war and trade union organizer 

Styron participated in the Berkeley Free Speech 
Movement in 1964 and organized the first anti-war 
teach-in in 1965. 

Styron 's SWP program includes : a cut-off of the U.S. 
military's funding , the disbanding of the Central In-
tellig nee Agency (C.I.A), a 100% tax on personal 
income over $30,000 a year (with no tax on personal 
income under $15 ,000 a year), and the nationalizatio'n 
of the oi I industry . 

The Soc ialist Workers candidal also favors the in-
clusi'on of a cost-of-living " esca lator" clause in every 
workers contract to help ease the burden of inflation . To 
combat unemployment the SWP favors a 30 hour work 
week (at current wages) to open up new jobs for the 
unemployed 

The uncovering of Watergate and related scandals 
didn 't surprise the SWP, Schneider said . They've had 
their own problems with espionage and wiretapping, he 
claimed and are in the process of filing a lawsuit 
against' Nixon, the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(F.B.I l. and others for all gedly illegally tapping their 
phones, opening their mail , and planting informants in 
their meetings They are also calling for an indep ndent 
investigation of alleged r .B.1. involvement in th 
murders of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King.

Percy Expects No '74 
Republican Gains 

by James G, Soto 
Senator Charles Percy said Saturday in San Diego that 

"the Republican party cannot possibly gain any House 
or Senate seats or any Governors mansions in 1974. 

Percy, a liberal Republican from Illinois, was speaking 
at a press conference and later at a bruncheon spon-
sored by the San Diego Republican Associates Saturday 
morning at the Vacation Village Hotel in San Diego's 
Mission Bay . 

Although Percy wanted to talk about other issues, 
most of the questions from the press were about 
Watergate. Percy said that although he hadn't had the 
time to read all the transcripts, he was "shocked and 
surprised at the tone of the transcripts." He went on to 
say that in all the years he had never known Ri chard 
Nixon to talk with expletives. Percy was also surprised 
that so many of the top presidential advisors wasted 
time with "talk of trivia ." 

Percy said that if he were the President he would "put 
all the facts on the table ." He did say however that he 
was glad the President released the transcripts. Percy 
said he would read the transcripts on the plane trip back 
to Washington . 

The Illinois Republican concentrated on party unity 
in his prepared statement to the press and in his speech 
to the Republican Associates . Percy said the GOP must 
broaden its base. The Republican party must becom a 
truly national party . 

"Our party has a grave challenge, Percy said. At No 
time has the GOP had so much difficulty gaining 
support. Percy ca lled upon Repub licans to have a sense 
of tolerance. 

On inflation, Percy said the best way to stop it right 
now was to vote against the tax cut proposed In 
Congress. Percy, wtio studied conomlcs in College,

The Third College 
Council itself was ap-
pointed last sprirfg by a' 
committee of faculty and . 
students, organized 'and 
chaired by Pasqual Mar-
tinez, who was then Dean 
of Third College. It must be 
noted, though,' that this 
organizational method was 
chosen by Third College 
students in a college-wide 

ballo~ . 
At Revelle College, all 

threE: .rUSC representatives 
are appointed by a majority 
vote of the Revelle Com-
mittee on College Affairs, a 
body composed of six 
stuqents, three faculty. and 
three administrators . The 
student members of RCCA 
are chosen in a college-
wide election in May of 
each year . Participation in 
the walk-up balloting last 
spring was about 600 out of 
2,300 eligible voters . 

By now the picture 
should be clear ; TUSC has 
essentially no popu lar 
mandate The only sem-
blance of democrati c 
student representation 
exists at Revelle College, 
and even there It IS indirect 
and diluted by the six non-
student members of RCCA. 

The group which TUSC 
actually represents and to 
which TUSC is directly 
accountable is the truly 
minute segment of the 
student body consisting of 
those students who have 
sufficient interest in student 
government and related 
activities to sacrifice the 

amount of time required to 
participate . The sad truth is 
that student interest in 
campus politics is so lcaw 
that anyone who wants .an 
official position can have

Congressional candidate Salm Kolis also attended the

support its attempts to get on the ~all<:>t . . 

The SWP is challenging the constitutionality of the 
present law, which requires new polit.ical part ies to 
either get 600,000 signatures on a petition or 60,000

The Crawling Eye Report 
Yeah, I 'm about to 

scream "Conspiracy! " again 
with some fresh ammo, and 
I still think the SLA smells 
funny, but before J get back 
into all that, I want to try 
and clarify a few things for 
the people who read the 
last two articles ( ee North 
Star, previous two issues) 
and h ave doubtlessly 
thought, " Interesting idea, 
but where's the proof?" 

First of all, I don't want to 
take any bows for the 
" interesting idea" . If you've 
ever studied the major 
assassi nations of the la t 
eleven years (Malcolm X, 
JFK, RFK , Martin Luther 
King, the Wallace attempt) 
or If you know very much 
about U .S. domestic and 
foreign intell igence 
operations, it is not much of 
a deduction to suspect the 
sLA of being a staging in 
thiS bag 

As for proof, well , I' ll 
never be able to satisfy 
anyone ' s social studies 
teacher These are 
government operations 
we're talking about, so 
you'll be hard pressed to get 
word one from them about 
thi s. Luck ily , however, 
they're forced to drop a few 
hints, like the FBI Co-Intel-
Pro memoes or the 
Watergate stuff Even more 
luckily, some moral-minded 
IOdlviduals on the inside 
take It upon themselves to 
make disclosures Dan 

Ellsberg is the obvious 
example, but perhaps even 
more important are the 
intelligence agents and ex-
agents who aren't so crazy 
about their work and 
anonymously break their 
oaths of secrecy to con-
tri bute to the investigations 
of "assassinologists" and 
other students of con-
spiracy. So when I quote, 
say, the work of Mark Lane 
(author of Rush to 
Judgement and co-author, 
with ex-UCLA prof Donald 
Freed, of Executive Action), 
I can 't tell you where he got 
some of his stuff becau e he 
can 't say . But I trust him . If 
you're going to maintain a 
conspiracy p rspective, you 
need trust in great measure. 
Intuition , imagination, and 
diligent research are all 
important. Unfortunately, 
though, a lot of the material 
on these subjects is not 
itself well -documented , 
either for reasons like" just 
said or because it's sloppily 
written . So you gotta have 
faith in its credibili ty . And, 
of course, discretion. I 
consult a large variety of 
sources and there are 
conflicting theories and 
Innuendoes. None of us can 
put our fi ngers on all of the 
particulars, but we all agree 
on the sway. 

Lest you think that 
conspiracy theorists are 
near-sighted old farts who 
get off on esoteric ideas 

from off-the-wall 
publications, I got my angle 
just by reading newspapers. 
San Diego Union, L.A. 
Times, nothing more. 

. Newspapers present stories 
in fragmented fashion , they 
drop stories or bury them 
deep in Section W when 
they cease to be "newsy", 
they never put stuff in 
context. But you can . A lot 
of the good info is in the 
middle or end of some 
interminably long and dull 
account of something you 
didn't want to read about 
anyway. Sure, you have to 
look other places to fill in 
the blanks, but you can get 
the framework delivered to 
your doorstep for a few 
bucks a month . 

So, I' ll footnote where 
reasonable and possible, 
but I can't promise absolute 
irrefutability. A case like 
the JFK assassination is easy 
for anyone to get into ' that 
the Warren Commission 
covered up a conspiracy to 
kill the President is 
irrefutable . The Com-
mission conducted such a 
massive investigation that, 
even with all the material 
that was censo red or 
distorted, there was enough 
left over for the Warren 
Report to drown in its own 
contradi ctions. With the 
SLA, there has been little to 
go on outside of what the 
sLA itself has said or done. 
But I think that is almost 
enough.

Inflation 
by P. Protter 

With inflation as rampant as it is, it is important to 
have some idea of how the value of one's wages arid 
savings decreases over the years . This is an especially 
Important factor in the process of determining one's 
degree of outrage over the paltry minimum wage ir.-
creases, and the decline in value of the wages of the 
underpaid, such as farmworkers . 

Suppose we want to know how long it will take a 
wage of S2 per hour to be worth Sl per hour at a given 
rate of inflation, say fifteen per cent. The procedure is 

Editor: simple. Since we wish to find out how long it will take 
It is unfortunate if money to halve in value, we merely look up the natural

every uttered word we 
should carefully take down

rather, we should consider 
them as fellow human 
beings who have been 
"learning" things for a while 
longer than us, who can 
help us to learn as well (a 
friend of mine says that she 
likes to " pick their brains" ,":====================::' 
to help herself-a phrase 
which at first sounds rather 
crude, but one which really 
expresses the elements of 
the learn i n g process!) . 

Many people say (a lmost 
proudly!) that they have 
never gone to a Prof's office 
to ask questions, either 
because they are too "shy", 
or else because they think 
that its easier to "look it up" 
in a book! Christ! We have a 
good faculty at this 
school -when you can talk 
to the person who MQll: the 
book, why limit yourself to 
an impersonal hunk of 
paper!! 

My observations of UCSD 
students show to be that if 
they are dissatisfied with 
the number of classes being 
offered, or don't think that 
what a particular class (ie. 
Professor) is teaching is 
valuable, rather than make 
a fuss and try to change 
something , they just sit 
meekly and take it, hoping 
that maybe " things will get

A three day Chamber Music Marathon to celebrate 
the joys of Spring is planned by the musicians of the 
UCSD Music Department for the weekend of May 10-12. 
Every conceivable instrument including voice, will be 
ca lled in to play. The music ranges from baroque to 20th 
century works, including jazz .

LUTHER'S BLUES, Luther Allison-Gordy 
G967 

Luther Allison has been part of the 
Chicago blues scene for over a decade 
playing and seemingly doing littl more 
than following the musical footsteps of 
his primary influences Otis Rush and 
Magic Sam . I'd come to think of him as 
an imitator, not a personally creative 
musician, but his new LP "Luther's Blues" 
requires a redefinit ion of his abilities . In 
<;11,1 it's a surprisingly compelling, con-
vi nci ng set of urban blues reflecting a 
great deal of personal artistic com-
mitment. High points are the opening 
title tune which features a fine display of 
blues-guitar finesse, Roosevelt Sykes' 
" Driving Wheel ", and a superb rendition 
of Magic Sam's trademark song, " Easy 
Baby" 

This is a solid blues album both 
tastefully produced and performed. 

RATED: GOOD

SOUNDS , Howard Roberts -Capitol 
ST11247 

Howard Roberts has been on the west 
coast since 1950 building a deserved 
reputation as one of the top sessIon 
guitarists and a fine jazz solOist In his 
own right. Unfortunately, "Sounds" IS 
simply a glossy aggregate of ten pop 
songs play d with much more poli sh 
than imagination . 5010 spontaneity and 
creativity is altogether sacrificed in favor 
of a commercially viable sound What 
results is a sterility close to the pop-Jazz 
of Oeodato or maybe... Ferrante & 
Teicher. 

RATED: FAIR

I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN, Ann 
Peebles- London XSH132079 

This is a solid album of contemporary 
rhythm and blues highlighted overall by 
Ms. Peebles " lIve" show-stopper, the 
knockout title tune " I Can 't Stand the 
Rain". Ann's voice has the strength and 
transmits emotion like the great gospel-
trai ned voice of Aretha Franklin . She is a 
superb vocalist and this, her third album, 
IS by far her finest, most consistent yet 

RATED: VERY GOOD

A NEW LIFE, The Marshall Tucker 
Band - Capricorn CP0124 

Despite the tit le 's possible Im-
pi icalions to the contrary, there's really 
nothing new here. "A New Lite" contains 
near that same fundamentally coheSive 
blend of country-western , rock, and 
.b lues as characterized the band's debut 
LP of a year ago, but the material here 

often seems ~o casual and low-kpy Ih.ll

I t is halfway through 
spring quarter and most of 
us have already caught the 
pring fever . The weather, 

for the most part, has b en 
sunny and warm causing 
mo t of us to head to the 
beaches . In six weeks all of 
us will be out of school and 
head d to or looking for 
ummer jobs. Keeping all of 

this in mind it is hard to 
believe that the UCSD ski 
team just finished their 
competitive eason . 

Since January the fifteen 
hardy ouls of the Tnton Ski 
team have been spending 
very other weekend on thE.'

race Cross took fourth , with

unday Joel cam back to

fare too well , either falling

rronek comment d that for 
this late in the eason the 
racing conditio n s were 
quite good, though rather 
icy In the morning when the 
women ran the course 

Three weeks ago the 
team turned in one of its 
finer performances, with 
the men takin g fir t place 
overall on the strength of 
several fine ' individual 
performances . In one race 
the men took second, fifth 
and seventh places , 
powering the team to its 
first place finish . 

Skii ng IS one of the more 
demanding sports at UCSD. 
The dedicated members of 
the team spend every other 
weekend, from Friday night 
to Sunday night, either 
skii ng or driving to or from 
a race, without getting any 
time to get much studying 
done. 

Another problem that the 
team faces is that of ex-
penses . The team is par-
tia lly funded by the Athletic 
Department , but a lot of the 
expenses incu rred mu t be

Open Letter 
The Rec reation Office wishes to express sincere 

thanks to all those who helped pl an, set-up and execute 
the tri cycle races thi s past Saturday. They were a huge 
success and hopefully have laid the groundwork for a 
yearly tradition for such an event at UCSD. A very 
specia l thank you is also extended to the Triton Times 
for its excellent publicity, support and coverage of the 
races . Tradition requires teamwork and everyone who 
helped or participated in the Trike Races should feel a 
sense of achievement and pride in a job well done.

Triton Nine Split 
Pair With Azusa 
After splitting a double 

header with league leading 
Azusa Pacific, the Triton 
baseball squad is looking to 
three important games this 
week, the outcomes of 
whi ch will determine 
whether or not they go to 
the NAIA District III 
playoffs. Presently i n 
second place, the Tritons 
must face Cal Baptist at 
Riverside today, then host 
third place Point Loma in a 
double header on Saturday. 

I n last Saturday'S action 
at Azusa Pacific UCSD took 
the first game 7-3 behind 
the pitching of Randy 
Mi ller. In the second game 
the Tnton pitchers ran into 
trouble with the AP Bats, 
losing 9-3. 

manage to hold on to 
second they will advance to 
the District playoffs at the 
end of the season . On the 
season the Tritons have an 
overall record of 17-12. 

On Friday the Tritons will 
play host to UC Irvine, the 
top small college (NCAA) 
team in the country. The 
Anteaters won the small 
college crown last year and 
are presently the top ranked 
team in the country, having 
amassed a winning streak 
of at least 18 games . They 
have beaten such teams as 
Ari zona State and USc. 

But the big games for the 
UCSD baseball squad are on 
Saturd ay as they host Point 
Lorna in a double header 
that will determine the final 
repre entative to the 
District playoffs . Point 
Loma is presently in third 
place o nly one game 
behind the TritMS 

FOCUi on Nick White 

There's A Superstar Among Us 
by Bob Moss 

A55istilnt Supervisor 
Physical Education Department 

"I'm the greatest" Is a reflection of the personal 
attitude and philosophy of star UCSD tennis player 
Nick White, Why should this you'ng man feel s~ 
confident about his personal tennis skills? One 
obvious reason is his recognition by Pancho Segura, 
who is noted as the premier tennis Instructor in the 
world, as having more potential and strength than 
any 16 year old he has ever seen, Currently, Nick is 
receiving specia~ instructions from the 
distinguished Segura, resident tennis pro at La 
Costa Country Club. Moreover; Â· the greatness of 
Nick White Is evident by his number one ranking on 
the UCSD tennis team at the age of (yes, you 're 
reading correctly) 16 yearsl To top things off , Nick 
has maintained a 3.4 grade pOint average, during his 
first quarter as a Third College Freshman! 

Winner of 25% of all tournaments he's par-
ticipated In, Nick first became interested in tennis 
while watching the 1971 Wimbledon and Forest Hills 
Championships on television. It was at that point in 
time (just a little more than three years ago), Nick 
vowed to himself : "One day I'll be there!" Today, 
Nick's intermediate-range goal is to become the 
best Junior tennis player in the world ; and in so 
doing, capture titles at both Wimbledon and Forest 
Hills , 

Majoring in economics , Nick's long range life goal 
is to become a positive force In the establishment of 
more meaningful economical involvement for Black 
people , "1 don't want to make tennis my entire life," 
Nick matter of factly states , "But I will utilize my 
tennis resources as a means of helping myself r so I 
will be In the best position to effectively Influence 
economic conditions for my peoplel " 

With a sparkling gleam In his eye, Nick quickly 
cites his parents and brother for encouraging him to 
strive for more than he can naturally achieve : "1 
thrive on winning for not only myself, but for my 
family and friends who have Inspired me to my 
current level of progressive development ." In an 
easy and relaxed manner, Nick continued to chat : 
" Hard work, determination , dedication to the game, 
along with the desire to win , will be the basis for my 
future tennis success! " 

Nick receives special sat is faction from h is tennis

endeavors allow ing him opportunities to meet and 
associate with top-notch personal ities , both In and 
out of the tennis world , His greatest tennis thrill s 
have centered around his contributions to the 1972 
and 1973 CIF Tea,m Champ ionships. won by his 
Beverly Hills High SchOOl tennis team . Nick was 
also selected to the 1973 CIF (statew ide) All Star 
tenn is squad . Nick's conflttence has also been 
nurtured by several opportunities to travel 
throughout the country ; during the past three 
months, he has played In tournaments at Miami 
Beach and New York, and during the past Summer , 
Nick played in no less than seven different states . I n the first game Miller stymied the Azusa Pacific 

bats while Curt Jenkins and 
Danny Kilpatrick supplied 
the fire power to lead the 
t am to its 7-3 win . Miller 
was able to get the AP 
hitters to pop up and 
ground out weakly, taking 
some of the load off of the 
defense. 

1M Volleyball News 
Nick Wh ite's success story is one packed full of 

positive att itude and , self confk:lence building 
principles, UCSD students, who dare to visualize 
themselves achieving the fullest limits of their 
human potential , need only use the " N ick Wh ite 
Success Saga" as a living model of confidence and 
self motivated student leadership. Yes , Nick White 
is certainly deserving of the title : "The Super Star 
Amongst Us ;" he is a student legend in his own 
time ; for one, I am thoroughly convinced th.::! Nick 
White will be a tremendous success at everyth ing he 
Itrives to achlevelll 

In the second game Bob 
Lofgren and Jeff Wiederholt 
both had problem s on the 
mound, neither of them 
lasting more than three 
innings. The Tritons staged 
a last inning rally but fell a 
bit short . They did score 
two runs, but left the bases 
loaded. Mark Farar pitched 
the last three innings for the 
Tritons, allowing only one 
run, but the damage had 
been done' earlier as Azusa 
Pacific mounted a 9-1 lead. 

The Tritons are presently 
in econd place in the

dI.E.C. Nuclear 
Power 

9. cD.E. 
The urgency of existing energy requirements, coupled with equally compelling 

demands for environmentally acceptable options, has placed nuclear power in the 
spotlight-with questions of nuclear plant safety undergoing the most searching 
Â·scru,tiny . 

Forecasts show that nuclear power will supply about 20 percent of U .S. electricity 
by 1980 and 45 percent by 1990. In addition to its advantages as a source of clean 
energy, nuclear power has proven to be both reliable and economical. Com-
monwealth Edison Co. of Chicago, the private utility with the nation 's largest nuclear 
capacity on line, reports that it has had more operating hours from its large nuclear 
plant than from fossil plants of comparable size. Other utiliti es report similar results . 
As for costs, in 1972 the average total cost to produce electricity from nuclear fuel 
was about 8.1 mills per kilowat t/hour, as opposed to 10.3 mills from fossil fuels . 

Many people have serious doubts about the safety aspect of nuclear plants. Ac-
tually, the nuclear industry has an extraordinary safety record . Protection of the 
public has always been of paramountimportance . In 1972, the accident rates for coa l-
fired plants were 25 times higher than for nuclear plants . But no responsible 
spokesman would call nuclear power risk free . Technical experts have est imated that 
the likelihood of an accident with serious consequences to the public is on the order 
of one in a million reactor years. Thus, the question to ask becomes-what I an a -
ceptable risk? 

Two matters are of primary concern . First, the dangers involved in transporting and 
storing high-level radioactive waste. The technology eXists to do this safely . The first 
shipment of such waste to a federal storage repository will not be necessary until the 
early 1980'5. By that time facilities for retrievable surface storage will isolate the waste 
in a manageable way. InCidentally, the volume of waste involved is much mailer 
than most people think. All the high-level wastes produced by all the nuclear plants 
contemplated to be in existence between now and the year 2000 wou ld not fill a 
football stadium. 

A second matter of considerable public interest is the routine discharge of very low 
levels of radioactive materials from nuclear plants. Few people realize that they are 
exposed to natural " baCkground" radiation every day, ranging from 70 to 200 
radiation units per year The level of exposure varies For example, a per on living in a 
brick hOllse can b exposed to up to 50 more units of radiation per year than someone 
living in a wooden house. Altitude also makes a difference: Cosmic radiation in New 
Haven, Conn ., for instance, is estimated at 73 units per year compared with 172 units 
in Denver. 

It's a good idea to put radiation exposure in perspective. In 1970 each person In the 
U.S. received a calculated 0.003 unit of radiation from nuclear plants . By the year 
2000, when the amount of electricity from nuclear plants will exceed the total amount 
of electricity used today, estimates show the average might be 0.4 of a unit. Anyone 
who takes a jet flight from New York to San Francisco is exposed to 10 times that 
amount of radiation due to increased cosmic radiation at a high altitudes. 

All discharges of radioactive material should be kept to as Iowa level as prac-
ticable . Radiation shoulc;l be respected, but unwarranted fears must be avoided. If we 
demanded zero exposure to radiation , chest X-rays would be outlawed because they 
result in exposures of 20 to 500 radiation units. 

It is therefore a distortion to portray a nuclear reaction as "an accident waiting to 
happen " On the other hand, it is just as wrong to treat nuclear plants nonchalantly . 
That IS one reason federal regulations ca ll for highly conservative margins of safety. 
For example. if research shows that a valve in a nuclear plant might leak under 10 
pounds of pressure, a working limit of as low as one pound might be established . 
Other safety features include engin ... ering systems that compensate for technical 
uncertai n ties. 

The so-called debate over nuclear power is not a mere Niagara of words . Its out-
(omp i vital to our nation's security. Differences of opinion exist about nuclear 
technelogy. as In any technology . This is a positive sign and contributes to ultimate 
'iafety However. we cannot afford to allow emotional pleas to sway the case. The 
American people comprise a great body of collective wisdom and it is up to each and 
f'very one of us to as ess the facts objectively and to make an informed judgement. 
There IS no doubt in my mind that common sense will rule regarding the role of 
nuclpar power In this country .

The mind of a bigot 
is like the pupil of the eye ' 
The more li ght you shed 
upon it the more it wi II 
contract 

-Oliver Wendall Holm s 

The more you learn about man-made nuclear reactors. the more you wonder how 
close you want to live to one. It begins to look as though US reactors are too close to 
wherever you may be. 

We yield to no one in our admiration for nuclear energy, properly situated. And the 
proper situation, it now appears to us, is for the nuclear energy source and the nuclear 
energy users to be rather widely separated. Our experience with the sun suggests that 
93 million miles is about right. 

Man-made nuclear reactors are not so well engineered as the sun. and none has 
been so thoroughly tested. The way things are looking now, there is no safe place on 
earth for nuclear reactors . 

Does this come as a surprise to you? It did to us, and an unweicc.r,,; " Jrprise at that. 
We had counted on the peaceful atom to relieve the pressure for mL: : hydroelectriC 
dams. more offshore oil rigs . more strip mining. and more pollution from Ie- si l-fuel 
power plants . 

But nuclear technology is vastly complicated . It takes men of genius to design 
reactors. men of skill and patience to build them. and men of infallible judgment to 
operate them . Also needed are an absence of bad luck, an absence of ill -will ex-
pressed as sabotage. and. as Nobel laureate and physicist Hannes Alfven pointed out, 
an absence of upsetting Acts of God. 

A little reactor accident on earth cou ld kill thousands Three thousand four hun-
dred. to be precise. Who says so? The US Atomic Energy Commission 's " Brookhaven 
Report" (more formally known as Theoretical Possibilities and Consequences of 
Major Accidents in Large Nuclear Power Plants, and often referred to by It code 
designation, (WASH-740). Scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory reported the 
possibility. in addition to 3,400 fatalities. of up to 43.000 injuries and property 
damage of up to seven billion dollars extending over an area as large as the State of 
California. All this from a single accident at a nuclear power plant. 

The gravest danger is not the blast effect of a big explosion . but the release of 
radioactivity to the environment- which might occur after a small explosion or no 
explosion at all. 

You can't insure your property against loss in the event of an accident at a nuclear 
power plant . Such coverage simply isn ' t available . 
More ominous still, utility companies that have "gone nuclear" can't buy liability 

insurance with which to settle claims against them in the event of an accident. The 
i'lsurance industry doesn't have that much confidence in the nuclear industry. 

Utility executives weren 't mad enough . however. to "go nuclear" without some 
form of protection against liability claims . Congress gave them the protection they 
needed by passing the Price-Anderson Act In effect, this strange legislation exempts 
utility compil"ies from liability in the event of nuclear accidents. It arbitrarily limits 
liability in any single accident to $560 million. The remaining $6 .5 billion of potential 
property damage (remember, that potential comes from the outdated and un-
derstated " Brookhaven Report" ) is picked up by the victims 

With this arbitrary ceiling imposed, did the Insurance industry volunteer to un-
derwrite that token $560 million? No. only a minor fraction of it. So most of the $560 
million . by provision of the Price-Anderson Act. will come out of taxpayers' pocke~ . 
You are in the quasi-insurance business. committed by Congress to bailout a high-risk 
industry that is essentially uninsurable because it's essentially unsafe 

We haven't even mentioned some of the gravest dangers. such as the risks inherent 
in transporting highly radioactive materials . 

We have omitted the possibility that plutonium may be stolen by do-it-yourself 
bombmakers . (5-10 kg . is enough for a Nagasaki-type A-bomb.) 

We haven't described the peril in development of the breeder reactor, which, by 
common consent. is far more dangerous than the l ight water reactors that threaten us 
now. 

We have not dwelled upon the vulnerability of nu I ar power plant to act of war, 
blackmail , sabotage. and - let's face it - Acts of God over which the AEC has little 
control. 

We have not addressed the still-unsolved problems posed by mounting ac-
cumulations of lethal radioactive wastes. which no one knows how to keep entirely 
out of the human nvironment for the necessary hundreds of thousands of y ars. 

And, most critical of all. we have not talked about what radiation does to you, to 
your genes, and th genetic heritage of all li ving things a far into the future as we can 
dream.
