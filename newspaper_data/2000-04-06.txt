Scientists Working 
On Cancer Vaccine 
Breakthrough on mice could lead to human 
clinical trials within the next two years 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

Scientists at UCSD are work-
ing on a vaccine against an 
enzyme found in a variety of 
human tumors. The vaccine may 
effectively mobilize the body's 
own immune system to attack 
'and kill cancer cells. 

A team led by Maurizio 
Zanetti, professor of medicine at 
UCSD and member of the UCSD 
Cancer Center, in collaboration 
with the Institut Pasteur in Paris, 
has successfully used a prototype 
vaccine in cancer cells in vitro to 
activate a type of lymphocyte 
called cytotoxic T-Iymphocytes, or 
CTL, to destroy cancer cells. , 

Lymphocytes are white blood 
cells that attack invading cells that 

are foreign to the body. 
Telomerase, an enzyme key to the 
uncontrolled replication of can-
cerous cells, is considered the first 
gene to playa direct role in the 
transformation of cells by allow-
ing precancerous cells 10 become 
immortal. 

Boris Minev, a co-author of 
the study from UCSD, said the 
lymphocytes can be "educated" to 
recognize and kill cancer cells. 

He said that if the vaccine is 
successful, it could be used in 
combination with other types of 
cancer treatment such as surgery, 
chemotherapy and radiation to 
rid a body of cancer. 

He added that immunothera-
py is much safer than traditional

Admission: 
Up to 8,000 expected to 
attend Admit day 
CoiIIIIIIIed "... ..... 1 

"Hopefully" we're bearing some 
fruits of those labors; he said. 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar said 
he credits the statistics with a 
change in the admissions process. 
Previously, 60rrcent of students 
were admitte based solely on 
numbers such as grade point aver-
ages and SAT scores. For the 
remaining 40 percent, admissions 
officers look at supplemental cnte-
ria such as leadership experience, 
community service, special circum-
stances and personal challenges. 

This year, however, only 50 per-
cent of students were admitted 
based on numbers. Admissions 
officers then took supplemental 
information into account for the 
remaining 50 percent of the stu-
dents admitted. 

Vaccine: 
Medidne may C01T]bat 
90 percent of all cancers 
chemotherapy. 

"Some of the medications 
given to patients are very toxic; 
he said. "In immunotherapy, the 
goal is to mobilize the immune 
system of people with cancer so 
that they can rid the cancer from 
their body." 

He said that immunotherapy 
would be most effective against 
very small tumors not visible on an 
X-ray. 

Zanetti explained how the study 
utilizes the immune system in 
fighting cancer . 

www. 

Khullar said that while the 
numbers look promising. this is 
only the first step in increasing 
diversity at UCSD. 

"We're a third of the way there," 
he said. "It's really great news. 
UCSD should celebrate that stu-
dents are being admitted, but we 
shouldn't start celebrating too 
much until we get them here." 

He added that once underrepre-
sented students come to UCSD, the 
campus must then work to retain 
them and see to it that they graduate. 

He said in order for underrepre-
sented students to want to come to 
UCSD, the university needs to 
increase scholarship funds because 
many students are being courted 
by other universities offering large 
financial aid packages. 

Backer said most people on 
campus are pleased with the 
admissions numbers. 

"I think folks are upbeat on 
campus; he said. "Folks are [excit-
ed] for Admit Day We're expecting 
a big turnout from students and 

"In cancer, the immune system 
becomes increasingly weakened 
and ineffective against rapidly pro-
liferating malignant cells; Zanetti 
stated. ·We wanted to see if the 
immune systems of individuals 
with cancer retained the ability to 
recognize telomerase, and if we 
could boost the immune response 
using telomerase in a prototype 
vaccine to expand CTL actively 
against cancer.~ 

Minev said that the vaccine 
could potentially work against 90 
percent of all cancers. 

He added, however, that scien-
tists need to do more work before 

• the vaccine becomes a reality. 
The next step, according to 

Minev, is to inject human cancer 
cells into mice with deficient 
immune systems. The scientists

Admit Day, which will be held 

Saturday, April 15, gives students 
admitted to UCSD the opportunity 
to visit the campus. 

Backer said students and families 
who attend will be able to tour the 
campus, receive financial aid and 
housing infonnation, and hear fac-
ulty lecwres, among other things. 

Backer said he is expecting as 
many as 8,000 people to attend 
Admit Day. 

Among the students admitted, 
the most popular majors are ~iolo­
gy, economICS, computer SCIence, 
engineering and psychology. 

"It's incredible; Backer said. 
"Because of the increased popular-
ity of the campus, we are attracting 
a strong, academically prepared 
group of students which I think 
speaks very well for the campus. It 
raises our prestige and it speaks 
very well of our faculty: 

Admitted students have until 
May 1 to declare whether they will 
attend UCSD. 

will then use the vaccine to try and 
cure the cancer in the mice. 

If this is successful, Minev said 
scientists will pursue phase one 
clinical trials and attempt to use the 
vaccine to cure skin, prostate and 
breast cancers. 

"I am very optimistic and I hope 
that in the next year-and-a-half to 
two years we will go to clinical tri-
als." 

In addition to Zanetti and 
Minev, other scientists working on 
the study include Jason Hipp and 
Joseph Schmidt of UCSD, and 
Pierre Langlade-Demoyen and 
Huseyin Firat of the Institut 
Pasteur in Paris . 

The scientists' findings were 
published in the April 4 issue of the 
Proceedings of the National

Grade Appeals 
Need Reform 

As the new quarter begins and UCSD 
students start to receive their grades from 
last quarter, many are disappointed with 
their results. 

While some students are satisfied with 
their grades, others may qu.estion whether 
there has been some error in tabulating 
their grades. These students are left with 
two options - accept the grade they 
received or complain to their professors. 

Asking a professor to change a grade is a 
ridiculously difficult process. First of all, 
just tracking down a professor during the 
first couple weeks of classes can be nearly 
impossible given that many don't start 
holding office hours until a few weeks into 
the quarter. In addition, offke hours are 
often packed with students. Requestin~ a 
grade change while 20 students are waitmg 
to speak to the professor can be a nerve-
racking experience. 

Second of all, students requesting a 
grade change have to deal with intimidat-
ing professors with whom they may have 
had no previous interaction. These pro-
fessors have a vested interest in not 
approving a grade change; doing so will 
only hurt their reputations. As a result, 
professors may be loathe to make any 
changes. 

For these reasons, the Guardian recom-
mends that there be a review conducted of 
the grade challenging process. UCSD stu-
dents work incredibly hard, and it is irre-
sponsible of the university to place the 
burden of grade inquiries solely on their 
shoulders. An unbiased third party, similar 
to student advocates, could be implement-
ed to make the process more equitable for 
both teachers and students. 

lAs and University 
Must Avoid a Strike 

Fortunately for students, teaching assis-
tants across the UC system have reached a 
tentative agreement with the University of 
California, postponing a potential strike for 
at least three weeks. 

While the Guardian supports collective 
bargaining between teaching assistants and 
the university, we find it unfortunate that 
students must suffer any time there are 
bargaining disagreements. According to 
teaching assistant unions, the decision to 
strike was prompted by unlawful actions 
taken by the university. The unions' com-
plaints included charges that the universi-
ty had ~nilatera.lly chan~ed working condi-
tIOns, ~Ithheld I~f~)fmatlon and engaged in 
regressive bargammg. 

Both the TA unions and the administra-
tio~ filed unfair labor practice complaints 
agamst each other with the California 
Public Employment Relations Board last 
month. As a result, PERB will review the 
charges and issue decisions. The Guardian 
feels that this is the proper avenue for 
resolving problems. 
. We applau? ~t.at~ legislators for ge~t!rtg 
mvolved and mltlatlng a three week medi-
ation period. We hope that both sides 
resolve their problems without having to 
resort to tactics that will only harm the stu-
dent body.

A Serious Cross-Examination of the 
Bible's Contents Verifies its Validity 
Despite frequent attempts to discredit and disprove them, many of the events in the 
Bible are backed by historical records as well as archeological finds 
IIJ TIIIODOIII DOUO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Judging by the rhetoric taught to stu-
dents at universities and written by the 
mainstream media across this country, 
the Bible is the most error-laced and 
unbelievable book in literature. We are 
told the stories contained in the Bible are 
mere fantasies of their writers and that 
the people and places spoken of are not 
historical because they have not been 
confirmed by independent writing. 

These critics claim there is no way 
that the Bible can be the inspired word of 
God as it purports to be. 

With all the attacks on the Bible, our 
post-modem culture has told us to pick 
what we like about the Bible and reject 
those parts that we feel are either unlov-
ing or politically incorrect. 

Despite all the charges against it, the 
Bible is still the world's best-selling book 
day after day, year after year. It would 
seem that the consumer still sees that 
there is something inside this book that 
liberal theologians and skeptics have 
tried to discount. Upon closer investiga-
tion , the Bible itself contains reasons 
why it is such a bestseller and why it has 
such amazing resilience. 

One amazing aspect of the Bible is 
that it is not a monolith, as some per-
ceive it to be. Quite to the contrary, it is a . 
book of great diversity. For some basic 
background we see that the Bible, a 
library of 66 books, was compiled over a 
period of 15 centuries, with the last book 
written near the very end of the first cen-
tury CE. 

lt was written in three different lan-
guages: Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic. It 
was penned by 40 different authors from 
three continents, whose positions ranged 
from sovereigns of nations to shepherds, 
physicians to tax gatherers, all of whom 
wrote independently of each other, often 
not knowing that there were others writ-
ing or who those others were. The 

If one were to analogize the 
Bible to a book of medicine, 
this medicinal book would 
have been written by 40 
different authors over a 
period of 15 centuries, and 
yet at the same time be so 
timeless that it could still cure 
the sick today, 
authors discuss a variety of matters, such 
as the nature of God, angels, demons and 
the problem of evil. If one were to analo-
gize the Bible to a book of medicine, this 
medicinal book would have been written 
by 40 different authors over a period of 
15 centuries, and be so timeless that it 
could still cure the sick today. 

Though the Bible was written by 
many different people, it is not a collec-
tion of books written about many differ-
ent topics, as some have contended. 
Rather, it has one theme that runs 
throughout the whole book. The theme 
of this great book can be summarized by 
two words: sin and grace. 

From the opening pages of the book 
of Genesis, the reader learns of the first 
sin by Adam and Eve. Then there is a 
projection of grace from God who tells 
the serpent that "I will put enmity 
between you and the woman, and 
petween your seed and her seed; He shall 
bruise you on the head, and you shall 
bruise Him on the heel" (Genesis 3:15). 

This opening prophecy about a 
descendent of Eve who would one day 
defeat the Serpent with a fatal blow is the 
basis on which the whole Bible grows. 
When debating the religious leaders of 
the time, Jesus declared, "Search the 
Scriptures, because you think that in 
them you have eternal life; and it is these 
that bear witness of Me" (John 5:39). 

Later, in the same debate, he tells the 
leaders, "For if you believed Moses, you 
would believe Me for he wrote of Me" 
(John 5:46). Even at the very end of 
Scripture, the book of Revelation pro-
claims "Come, Lord Jesus" (Revelation 
22:20). Much like a garment that is 
woven of various threads while still con-
tributing to the whole grand design, 
Christ is the unifying theme of the New 
Testament. 

One aspect of the Bible that sets it 
apart from any comparable text, religious 
or otherwise, is the unity of theme' and 
message that it achieves. This unity is 
apparent despite the diversity of literary 
structure and genre, authorship, view-
point and chronology. These different 
pieces fit together to form a single mag-
nificent arrangement. The magnificence 
of this structure can be offered up as evi-
dence that there is a single designer who 
used the different authors as part of a 
master plan. The Bible is a well-designed 
stru<;ture assembled by a single, super-
intelligent architect. 

As a second set of evidence, one can 
look at the preponderance of historical 
proof. Time and time again, critics have 
tried to discredit the Bible, yet they have 
always failed . The Bible has consistently 
quieted the critics who seek independent 
refudiation of the events that are record-
ed i/'lit. 

Many would say that the Hittite peo-
ple about which the Old Testament 
speaks had to be a figment of the writer's 
imagination'. However, in 1912 a German 

professor .di.scover~d tablets which spoke 
of the Hittite nation at the site of the 
Hittite capital. As for the New 
Testament, archaeology has discovered 
the pool of Bethesda written about in 
John 5:2, along with the altar to "an 
unknown god" in Athens (Acts 17:23). 

Some doubted the existence of Pilate, 
the Roman official who condemned

Lawsuits Brought Against Gun Manufacturers are Unwarranted 
Federal safety regulation and better enforcement of laws governing the sale of firearms are the real solution to gun violence 
.,"N1'DON 
Opinion Editor 

A rash of recent shootings in 
schools and the workplace have 
once again dragged the issue of 
firearms into the national spot-
light. Amid a popular outcry for a 
reaction to these incidents, elect-
ed officials on every level of gov-
ernment have responded by 
proposing stricter laws for the sale 
of firearms, trying to force gun 
manufacturers to include safety 
locks on all their new models and 
by suing gun manufacturers for 
contributing to the rise of gun 
violence across the country. Many 
of the proposed laws promise to 
be effective remedies to many of 
the problems of gun violence, but 
the lawsuits brought against 
firearm manufacturers by various 
state and city governments are 
unreasonable and unjustifiable. 

The American fascination with 
guns is ingrained in our very his-
tory. Tl)is .country was born in a 
revolution where citizen soldiers 
picked up their personal rifles and 
rallied to fight the British army. 
Settlers in the old west battled the 
Native American tribes and one

jesus of Nazareth to death. They 
too have been quieted by historical 
evidence. Those who wish to prove 
away the Bible have been stunned 
into silence after archaeology has 
confirmed the historical events and 
people in the Bible. 

In addition to the evidence pro-
vided by archaeology, historical 
writings confirm the person of 
Jesus as a historical figure. 
Contemporary secular literature 
refers to him a minimum of 13 
times. The most vital event in 
Scripture involving jesus, the res-
urrection, is also confirmed by 
independent and historical docu-
mentations. The well-noted and 
well-respected Jewish hist(\rian 
Josephus referred to the resurrec-
tion. He wrote, "At this time there 
was a wise man called Jesus, and his 
conduct was Sood and he was 
known to be VlnUOUs. Pilate con-
demned him to be crucified and 
die. But those who had become his 
disciples did not abandon his disci-
pleship. They reponed that he had 
appeared to them three days after 
his crucifixion and that he was 
alive." 

The exhibits presented above 
and written history are only a sam-
ple of the many sources of evidence 
supporting the Bible's accuracy. 
There are many other reasons such 
as the personal testimonies of mil-
lions upon millions of people who 
have had their lives changed by the 
book, the prophecies that have 
come true and the confirmation of 
scientific tenets that the Bible 
speaks about, to name a few. 

Clearly it is neither illogical 
nor an act of ignorance to believe 
in the Bible. However, the chal-
lenge to all who come across this 
amazing book is to personally 
investigate the claims it makes. 
One must decide for oneself 
whether the Bible is truly what it 
claims to be, or if it is not even 
worth the paper it is written on. 
There cannot be a middle road 
where one picks and choOSfS 
what one likes, much like a buffet 
lunch. The challenge is for all to 
take an objective look at the Bible 
for all it is. Many have done so 
with the intent of proving it as a 
farce, but have been convinced 
otherwise. Will you accept the 
challenge and decide for yourself?

another to carve out a new empire 
with the help of firearms. Many 
critics have recently accused the 
entertainment industry of glorify-
ing firearms throu~h violent films, 
television and Video games in 
popular culture. 

At the root of this cultural fas-
cination is the Second 
Amendment, which guarantees 
citizens the right to bear arms. 
The Second Amendment is 
unique in that it is the only 
amendment in the Bill of Rights 
which justifies its existence: "A 
well regulated Militia, being nec-
essary to the security of a free 
State, the right of the people to 
keep and bear Arms, shall not be 
infringed." 

In light of this proviso, the 
exact intent of the Second 
Amendment is questionable, to 
say the least. There are three main 
interpretations: First, that the 
authors were referring to i(1terna-
tional security, and expected that 
the common people would be 
needed to defend the nation in 
times of war. Second, that this 
amendment was designed to 
ensure the right of the people to 
overthrow the government if it 

At the root of this

the Second Amendment,

that it is the only 
amendment in the Bill

became tyrannical, thereby ensur-
ing that the United States would 
remain "a free State.~ The third 
interpretation is that the authors 
were considering internal securi-

ty, and that they wanted to main-
tain citizens' rights fo bear arms 
for their personal protection . 

The first interpretation of the 
Second Amendment has been 
invalidated with time. It is no 
longer practical for civilian sol-
diers to rise to the defense of the 
nation in times of war; modern 
warfare necessitates a standing, 
professional army to fulfill this 
duty. Citizens with rifles and 
handguns cannot hope to stand 
up against mechanized infantry 
and guided missiles. 

Consequently, the develop-
ment of a professional army has 
effectively removed any hopes of 
the common people overthrowing 
the U.S. government, regardless of 
the deluded aspirations of the var-
ious militia movements in this 
country. Just as the common peo-
ple have no hope of repelling a 
foreign invasion, average citizens 
have no chance of standing up 
against the U.S. military if it is 
called upon to defend the govern-
ment. This is not to say that it is 
no longer possible for the 
American people to ovenhrow the 
government, but rather that any 
such revolt would have to have 

the support of the military if it is 
to have any chance of succeeding, 
as has been the case in other 
countries that have experienced 
coups or revolutions in the 20th 
century. 

This leaves the third in terpre-
tation of the Second Amendment 
as the only valid contemporary 
reading: that it is meant to allow 
American citizens to own firearms 
for their own personal protection. 
This is the point that gun manu-
facture rs and firearms lobbyists 
such as the Nationa l Rifle 
Association have repeated time 
and time again to combat gun 
control legislation . 

As self-serving and old-fash -
ioned as this rhetoric may seem at 
times, the fact remains that it is a 
legally sound argument. As well-
intentioned as the various states' 
lawsuits over gun violence may 
be, their actions are ultimately 
leading towards a contlict with the 
Consti tut ion that they cannot 
possibly win .

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

UCSD Acts Callously Tow_cis Employe .. 
Students who are let go from university positions don't receive any 
assistance finding another job that most professional companies provide 
. , KIM HOOPER 
Staff Writer 

If you are considering getting an 
on-campus job, thinking that it 
would be less intimidating and 
more secure than a posi tion at 
some corporation, think aga in. I 
used to think on-campus jobs were 
organized to provide starving stu-
dents with an income (however 
meager), and that the employment 
opportunities available for students 
would provide a valuable learning 
experience to facilitate the transi-
tion into the "real world." I 
assumed that on-campus jobs had 
responsibilities and requirements 
just like other jobs, but [ also 
assumed that the UCSD bubble 
was somewhat removed from the 
cut- throat, profit-driven employ-
ment market. 

Then one of my friends told me 
a story about his experiences as an 
employee of UCS 0, and all my pre-
conceptions changed. 

This friend, who shall remain 
nameless so that he is not stalked 
and maimed by the UCSD powers, 
is currently out of a job due to what 
I consider a betrayal by the very 
school that takes thousands of dol-
lars from him each quarter. He 
worked for a major academic 
department, handling its databases. 
One day, out of the blue, his job 
was "reclassified." For the new 
position , he needed knowledge of 
html format and other computer 
technologies, which he did not 
have. After a pathetic "thanks-for-
your-good-work" speech, accom-
panied by a "we-really-don't-give-
a-damn" smile, he was out of a job. 

[ would expect that his 
employers, with the help 
of UCSD employment 
services, would assist him 
in finding another 
position before giving 
him the proverbial ax, 

Operating under the assump-
tion that college is preparation for 
the real world , in this case I have to 
wonder what happened to the real-
world notion of two weeks notice. 
My friend had no warning about 
the transformation of his position, 

. and his employers were less than 
sympathetic about the fact that he 
would have to endure a period of 
time without income while he 
expended time and energy in the 
search of another job. 

I could conceive of a fast-paced, 
corporate office exhibiting such 
unprofessional discourtesy, but a 
public school? UCSD employers 
know that students they em~loy 
are most likely far from financIally 
secure. They know that students 
are preoccupied with academic 
pursuits as well as other duties that 
prevent them from having back- up 
jobs. They know that, as students, 
we have expenses - tuition, books, 
rent, car, gas, coffee - that drain 
our savings accounts. It is incon-
siderate that students should have 
to play hardball with their own 
school - the school that is partly 
responsible for draining that sav-
ings account in the first place. 

Considering how many stu-

dents re ly on employment while in 
college, I expected that UCSD's 
services would include s6me sort 
of aid for those put out of work 
due to these incidental reclassifi -
cations. In my friend's case, a 
training program could have been 
implemented to help him to pre-
pare for the new job's duties. Html 
is not rocket science. There are 
workshops that can teach it in a 
day's time. 

Or, I would expect that his 
employers, with the help of UCSD 
employment services, would assist 
him in finding another position 
before giving him the proverbial 
ax. 

Businesses in the real world 
often make an effort to aid dis-
placed workers. Students deserve 
to be treated as valid employees. 
not cheap and disposable help. 

Given my friend's entangle-
ment, I must say that I am wary of 
UCSD's employment system. I am 
sure that many people have had 
positive experiences and maybe 
some praise UCSD for rescuing 
them from the impoverishment of 
unemployment hell. However, it is 
important to ask whether UCSD 
puts its student workers or its own 
needs ' first. Of course, employers 
aim for the greatest efficiency, but 
employees have rights. 

By the way, if you ha~pen to sec 
a bitter-looking guy hving in a 
cardboard box in front of the gas 
station on the corner of La Jolla 
Village Drive and Villa La Jolla , 
reassure him that he'll find another 
job ... and give him some change 
while you're at it.

Sand, Oil and Twinkies 
Figure in Foreign Policy 
High gas prices are the result of more than just 
the greed of OPEC and the major oil companies 
Daily Nebraskan 

(U-WIRE) LINCOLN, Neb. -
Okay, so gas is expensive right 
now. 

Well, expensive. sort of. While 
prices in Nebraska hover around 
$1.50 per gallon, in Europe and 
other countries they hover much 
higher. Really, $1 .50 per gallon 
only seems high here because it 
was very low last summer. 

What is the cause of this price 
hike? Most directly, the price hike 
is connected to the fact that the 
price for a barrel of oil these days 
IS around $28 - down from a peak 
in March at $34. When $as was 
cheap last summer, the gOing rate 
was around $11. A good part of 
the reason that the price is as high 
as it is now has to do with the 
Organization of Petroleum 

Exportin~ Countries' tighter con-
trol on 011 production. 

Congress is trying to persuade 
OPEC to release more oil - by 
threatening an end to economic 
aid and cutting off trade. After all, 
the United States deserves the 
cheaper prices after having bailed 
out Kuwait in the Gulf War. Some 
people reason that we'd be buying 
oil from Saddam Hussein if it 
weren't for our military interven-
tion (even though we buy from 
him anyway). The OPEC mem-
bership of Venezuela, Algeria, 
Libya, and Indonesia is neglected 
(no, OPEC is not just in the 

Middle East) . 
OPEC's reluctance to release 

more oil - at least in the cases of 
Iran and Libya - is understand-
able. Duting our wonderful gas-
guzzling summer, OPEC lost $65 
billion in revenue. So those coun-
tries don't want to put too much 
oil into the markets. for fear that 
the prices will drop again. 
Meanwhile, other countries such 
as Saudi Arabia are more willing to 
release more oil - though not as 
much as the United States would 
IiYe. 

And it is Saudi Arabia, the 
most powerful OPEC nation, that 
is behin(l' the recent push to 
increase production. Iran, one of 
the most vocal opponents to 
increasing production, has 
accused Saudi Arabia of submit-
ting to U.S. political pressure. 
Given that the United States not 
only has bcl:n threatening OPEC, 
but also lobbying it heavily, this 
would not be surprising. 

U.S. behavior in this whole sit-
uation is a bit immature. Once 
economic trends cause us to 
begin to suffer a little, the com-
mon citizen goes nuts and 
demands some sort of action. Gas 
prices are high, so what? 
Demanding that OPEC increase 
production for the sake of the 
working mom who commutes to 
soccer games every other evening 
is just absurd . Accusing the

During the non-snow off season the US Womens' Alpine Ski 

Team members used the "Ski Team" diet to lose 20 pounds in two 
weeks. That's right - 20 pounds in 14 days! The basis of the diet is 
chemical food action and was devised by a famous Colorado phYSician 
especially for the US Ski Team. Normal energy is maintained (very 
important) while reducing. You keep "full" - no starvation - because 
the diet i designed that way. It's a diet that is easy to follow whether 
you work, travel or stay at home. (For men too!) 

This is, honestly, a fantastically successful diet. If it weren't, 
the US Womens' Alpine Ski Team wouldn't be permitted to use it! 
Right? So, give yourself the same break the US Ski Team gets. Lose

TWINKlES:' 
OPEC has their own 
interests to consider 
ContIM .. ".. ...... 
greedy OPEC nations of exploiting 
the American consumer is so stu-
pid it's funny. 

Exploited? Soccer moms? Oh, 
the horrorl Especially after we have 
gotten where we have on cheap for-
eign labor, oppressed classes and 
Third World countries. It's called the 
economy: You pay for what you 
want, and if expensive gas means no 
pizza on Friday night, tough. 

Instead of using this as an oppor-
tunity to orate how wonderful the 
United States is and all that we've 
done to save the world from itself, 
maybe we could examine those very 
social trends that have firmly 
clamped our gonads in the hands of 
oil-producing countries. We've set 
ourselves up for this through a car-
centered culture and urban sprawl. 

This childish reaction isn't 
restricted to just the price of a 
nearly universally needed com-
modity. Heard ofTwinkies? 

When the Teamsters recently 
went .on. strike against the 
Interstate Bakeries Corporation, 
people throughout New En~land 
were cut off from their Twinkle fix . 
Given a'necdotal reports from 
packaged bakery merchants, it 
would seem that Twinkies, too, 
constituted an essential commodity 
in the New England states. 

Customers were angry, outraged 
even, that their favorite pre-pack-
aged baked goods were no longer 
available. It seemed as though they 
couldn't understand the basic prin-
ciple of item location: If it isn't . 
here, you can't buy it here, and to 
get it here, you've got to ship it 
here. In other words. customers 
exhibited that same childish inabil-
ity to understand why the world 
around them changes. 

The citizens of th is country 
have become so complacent about 
the luxuries we enjoy that a legiti -
mate danger is forming. We have 
become so used to an unending 
supply of reasonably affordable 
gasoline that when that supply is 
endangered, we respond not by 
changing our behavior, but by 
complaining and coercing a retum 
to the status quo. 

The oil supply will be exhausted. 
Eventually. the earth will have no 
more to offer us, and while that 
point may be in the near or distant 
future, inevitably, it will come. When 
it does come, we will be forced to 
deal with the very problems we are 
already setting up now - with huge, 
expansive cities and city planning 
built around the assumption that 
cars will be the most common form 
of transportation. 

I'm not worried that these prob-
lems are insurmountable. The 
economy, based on a free market 
ideology, will fill the gaps that our 
culture right now is leaving. 
However, the complacency that is 
now being bred in our society by 
lush living is resulting in an intel-
lectual sloth that will inhibit any 
attempt to change society when it 
becomes necessary to do so. 

This OPEC fiasco is a warning 
light on the dashboard of our social 
development. It shows that we are 
beginning to deal with a changing 
world not by adapting to it, but by 
using what power we have to force it 
to stay the same. Instead of finding 
new or innovative solutions first, we 
try to make things "right" again . 

But this won 't always work. 
Funher, we portray ourselves as a 
bunch of spoiled brats who must 
get our way - and antagonizing the 
rest of the countries of the world, 
while within our means, is certain-
ly not the wise thing to do. 

So, if gas prices rise this sum-
mer to the, $2-per-gallon level, as 
some have predicted, don't write an 
angry letter to your senator. 

Get out your bike. Go on fewer 
joy rides. Carpool. Walk. Do what-
ever. 

Just stop complaining.

U.S. Citizen Arrested on Spy Charges in Russia 

MOSCOW...,.. Russian security 
agents arrested .an unidentified 
U.S. citizen and an alleged Russian 
accomplicf on spying charges 
Wednesday and were holding both 
men in Moscow's Lefortovo 
Prison. 

In a statement, the Russian 
domestic security agency 
accused the American, 
described as the head of a pri-
vate firm, of having "deliberate-
ly established contacts over a 
long period with Russian scien-
tists" in order to obtain state 
secrets. The Russian, also 
unidentified, was described as a 
specialist working in the 
Russian defense industry. 

A Russian TV news report 
Wednesday night said that both 

men would be charged Thursday, 
when their names will probably be 
released. 

The U.S. Embassy here 
refused to comment on the case, 
but in Washington on Wednesday 
the State Department's 
spokesman, James P. Rubin, said a 
U.S. consular officer had visited 
the American and described him 
as being in good health and 
hopeful of resolving the matter 
soon. 

Without diplomatic immunity, 
the American could face a jail 
sentence of 10 years to 20 years 
on espionage charges, a Russian 
news agency reported 
Wednesday. 

Wednesday's arrests are 
among a series of Cold War-

style spy spats between Russia 
and Western nations in recent 
months, and come at a time 
when President-elect Vladimir 
Putin is trying to reassess 
Russia's relations with the 
West. 

Last November, a U.S. diplo-
mat, Cheri Leberknight, was 
arrested and accused of spying 
after Russian agents said they had 
caught her on her way to meet a 
Russian contact in a Moscow 
park. 

Both Leberknight and the con-
tents of her handbag were shown 
on Russian television, in an 
unusually public display of a case 
that would have typically been 
handled secretively. 

Leberknight was quickly 

released and soon left the country. 
Soon after that, U.S. agents in 

Washington caught a Russian 
diplomat who was allegedly moni-
toring a microphone that had 
been planted in a conference room 
on the executive floor of the State 
Department. 

Last month, the Russians said 
they had uncovered a Russian 
citizen who had been passing on 
reports - including some about 
Putin's presidential campaign -
to the British Embassy in 
Estonia. 

In Poland, the Warsaw govern-
ment earlier this year expelled sev-
eral Russian diplomats on espi-
onage charges.

Turkish Parliament Rejects Second Term for President 
ISTANBUL, Turkey 

Defying Turkey's aged political 
elite, parliament Wednesday 
rejected a constitutional amend-
ment that 1V0uid have allowed 
President Suleyman Demirel to 
seek a second term. 

The proposal to change the 
constitution, which limits presi-
den ts to one term of seven years, 
received 303 votes, considerably 
short of the 367 needed for a two-
thirds majority. As a result, 
Demirel will have to step down 
next month and be succeeded by a 
new president chosen by parlia-
ment. 

The vote was not only a defeat 
for Demirel but also for Prime 
Minister Bulent Ecevit, who had 
campaigned hard for Demiral on 
the grounds that he was "a factor 
for stability: There was no imme-
diate indication that Ecevit's gov-

ernment was in danger of collaps-
ing. 

"Our government will continue 
its duty in harmony and determi-
nation: Ecevit said after the vote. 
"We hope the result was what was 

of that slippage. the leader of the 
main opposition party, whll is also 
in his 70s, is being challenged for 
party leadership by a young insur-
gent.

This was a worn-out face and a worn-out figure. 
The passing of the torch has begun." 

best for our nation." 
Both Demirel and Eceyit are in 

their 70s, and the vote in parlia-
ment suggested that their genera-
tion's hold on Turkish politics may 
finally be slipping. In another sign 

-lei ... 
University professor 

dency has little formal authority, 
Demirel has accumulated consid-
erable power in the seven years he 
has served. During that time, 
Thrllqr was characterized by frac-
tured and short-lived govern-

ments, and Demirel eagerly moved 
to fill the vacuum. 

One of his successes was seiz-
ing control of Turkey's foreign 
policy toward the new nations of 
the Balkans, Caucasus and Central 
Asia. Yet even on issues like this, 
his leaving office does not seem 
likely to push Turkey in new direc-
tions. 

"The real meaning is that our 
political system is starting to 
mature: said Soli Oul, a universi-
ty professor who wrote several 
newspaper columns opposing 
Demirel's re-election. "Poll after 
poll suggested that 70 to 75 per-
cent of the people didn't want 
another term. This was a worn-
out face and a worn-out figure. 
The passing of the torch has 
begun."

Virus: 
New drug effective to

CoMI .... ".. ..... 1 
with the virus will still die prema-

said, but many could add years to 
their lives and have longer gaps 
between dcuHilllting complications.

moxazole. is marketed as a generic 
medicine in the United States. treat-

in~ a variety of ailments including 
unnary tract infections and bronchi-
tis; it is best known as Bactrim, a 
trademark of Roche Pharmaceuticals. 

In Africa, ongoing use of the 
drug can cost as little as $8 a year 
per patient. Its use as a preventive 
measure in Africa was endorsed for 
the first time last week by AIDS 
experts who convened in 
Zimbabwe to assess the studies. 
The Clinton administration is 
spending more than $100 million 
to fight AIDS in Africa and is trying 
to raise that to $325 million . 

"We did some of the original 
work on this and we're extremely 
enthusiastic about it: said Helene 
Gayle, director ofthe AIDS division 
of the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta. 

"It's cost-effective, it's ready to 
roll and it may become an impor-
tant component of the program, 
but upfront we can't make any cost 
projections yet." 

Endorsing the drug was "a diffi-

not definite yet: said Peter Piot, 
executive director of UNAlDS, a 
joint program under the World 
Health Qrxanization that includes a 
number or U.N. agencies, including

able. can prolong the life of HIV-
infected people and improve their

National News House Backs 'Partial Birth' Abortion Ban 
Microsoft: 
Justice department 
prevailed in case M~ 
between Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson and lawyers for the gov-
ernment and Microsoft. 

"It was an expedited process 
that everyone agreed on," said Joel 
Klein, head of the the Justice 

reasons, government officials 
would probably favor a direct 
appeal to the Supreme Court. 

Under the plan announced on 
Wednesday, the state and federal 
governments must submit their 
remedy proposal to the judge no 
later than April 28, and Microsoft 
is to offer its reply on May to. A 
court hearing, presumably with 
witnesses, would begin on May 
24. 

Though 
Department 's 
antitrust division. 

The Justice 
Department pre-
vailed in the case 
when Jackson 
ruled on Monday 
that Microsoft was 
a "predatory" 
monopolist that 
had acted illegally 
to protect its mar-
ket domination. 

With this fast-
track schedule, 
the judge 
appeared to drop 
the idea, discussed 
at a meeting earli-
er this week, of 
immediately 
appealing his own 
findings of law to 
the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the 
District of 

Under the plan 
announced on 

~dnesday, the state 
and federa:l 
governments must 
submit their remedy 
proposal to the judge 
no later than April 
28, and Microsoft is 
to offer its reply on 
May 10. A court 
hearing, presumably 
with witnesses, 
would begin on 
May 24. 

Jackson indicated 
that he would 
prefer to receive a 
single remedy 
proposal from the 
state and federal 
officials, he also 
told them they 
could submit two 
if they could not 
agree. 

The judge 
also told the 
states that they 
should submit a 
proposal "pre-
ferred by a major-
ity of the plaintiff 
states" an 
important pro-
nouncement 
because it would 
not allow a hand-
ful of states to 
hold ou t for their 
preferred remedy 
against the will of 

Columbia Circuit, before he 
deliberates on a remedy. 

It also remained possible that 
Jackson might encourage an 
appeal directly to the Supreme 
Court once the proceedings are 
over - another idea he men-
tioned on Tuesday. Microsoft 
would almost certainly oppose 
that because in previous rulings 
some judges on the appeals court 
have agreed with some of the 
company's positions. For the same 

the majority. 
The 19 state attorneys general 

hold a range of opinions on reme-
dies, and some of them believe 
that only a structural remedy, like 
breaking .up the company, will 
work, officials said. A growing 
number of influential attorneys 
general hold the view that break-
ing up the company is "too radi-
cal."

WASHINGTON 
Disregarding President Clinton's 
promise of ~ another veto, this one 
in an election year, the House on 
Wednesday passed a bill that would 
ban an abortion procedure that its 
opponents caU "partial birth." 

In what has become a routine 
showdown over the procedure, 
replete with photographs of cuddly 
babies and accusations of infanti-
cide, 287 House members voted 
for the ban and 141 opposed it, 
exceeding the number needed to 
override a presidential veto by two 
votes. Abortion rights supporters 
have picked up nine votes since the 
last time the House took up the 
measure, in 1997, mostly from new 
members of Congress. 

In order to override a presiden-
tial veto, both the House and 
Senate must pass a bill with a two-

thirds majority. However, when the 
Senate approved the ban in 
October, it fell two votes short of 
the number needed to block a veto. 

So Wednesday's vote was a kind 
of kick-off for a broader abortion 
rights debate, both on the cam-
paign trail and before the Supreme 
Court. 

The Supreme Court will hear 
arguments this month on the con-
stitutionality of a ban on Mpartial 
birth" abortions in Nebraska, mak-
ing it the first time in eight years 
the court has taken up an abortion 
case. Such bans have been enacted 
in about 30 states, but in most 
cases have been struck down or 
curtailed by lower courts. 

Wednesday's House vote drew a 
clear line between Gov. George W. 
Bush, who supports a ban, and 
Vice President AI Gore. who 

opposes one. 
"Never in the history of man 

has more lip service been paid to 
the needs of children, never in 
the history of man have so many 
children been sacrificed so mer-
cilessly in such high number," 
said Rep. Tom Delay, the Texan 
who is the third-ranking 
Republican in the House. 
"Abortion is a stain we must 
begin to wash away. A ban on 
partial birth is the first step.· 

Democrats complained that 
Republicans did not want to pass 
a bill that Clinton would not veto 
- one that would include an 
exception to protect the health of 
the mother - because they want-
ed to use the issue for political 
purposes.

Panel Urges Regulation of E~gineered Food 
Saying that genetically engi-

neered crops have the potential to 
pose food safety risks and environ-
mental harm, the National 
Academy of Sciences on 
Wednesday cautiously endorsed 
the safety of biotech foods now on 
the market, but called fur stronger 
regulation of the novel plants. 

The academy focused only on 
plants that have been genetically 
engineered to produce their own 
pesticides. The report emphasized 
that there was no evidence that any 
foods on supermarket shelves 
made from those plants are unsafe 
to eat. The report also said that the 
process of inserting genes from 
one species into another was not 
inherently dangerous. 

Still, the report is a striking shift 
in tone from two earlier academy 
reports on the subject, which 
emphasized the safety and benefits 

of genetically modified organisms. 
In the last decade, genetic engi-

neers have inserted foreign genes 
into plants to endow them with 
various abilities including with-
standing exposure to herbicides 
and creating their own pesticide. 
American farmers last year planted I 
20 million acres of a com that pro- . 
duces its own pesticide, Bt. 
Greenpeace and other environ-
mental and consumer groups have 
waged campaigns against such 
crops. 

The report was prepared by a 
12-member panel chosen by the 
National Research Council, an arm 
of the National Academy of 
Science. The report grew from a 
dispute over a rule proposed by the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
in 1994 that would allow it to reg-
ulate these plants. 

Although the agency has been 

operating under this rule informal-
ly, the rule's formal adoption has 
been held up for six years by the 
protests of thousands of agricul-
tural scientists and their support-
ers in Congress. 

The academy recommended that 
the EPA's rule be adopted and 
strengthened. It said that the govern-
ment should consider conducting 
studies that test for harm from long-
term consumption of biotech foods. 

The report also recommended 
that the EPA extend its regulation 
to crops engineered to be resistant 
to viruses, which some fear have 
the potential to create so-called 
super weeds. 

Both anti-biotech activists and 
industry claimed victory from dif-
ferent parts of the report.

Scientist: 
Wilson directed research 
group at time of death 
ContIIwed ".. ..... 1 
"Kent touched and enriched many 
lives and will be sorely missed. His 
indelible personal and professional 
mark will long be stamped on 
everyone who had the privilege of 
knowing him." 

Wilson's developed a passion 
for science early on, growing up 
in a Pennsylvania Quaker com-
munity that boasted many scien-
tists. There he developed a pas-
sion for science early on in his 
upbringing. He exhibited what 
was to become a life-long interest 
in science when he rewired the 
town's phone system and 
repaired household appliances. 

After earning a bachelor'S 
degree in chemistry and physics 
from Harvard University in 1958, 
he received his doctorate from 
the University of California, 
Berkeley in 1964, where he 
worked with Nobel Laureate 
Dudley Herschbach. Wilson went 
on to do postdoctoral work at 
Harvara and the National Bureau 
of Standards before accepting a 
professorship at UCSD in 1965. 

In the 1960s, Wilson's research 
group pioneered a technique for 
photofragment spectroscopy that 
allowed them to manipulate the 
molecules in a state of instability. 
In the 70s, he used laser spec-
trosCopy to view the chemistry of 
atmospheriC poUution. In the '80s, 
he used ultrafast laser experiments 
and computer simulations to 
develop an understanding of how 
reactions occur in solutions. In the 
last decade he used X-rays to 
explore and control chemistry. His 
discoveries have contributed to 
such things as a better understand-
ing of atmospheric pollution and 
dating of ancient statues. 

In addition to his achievements 
in chemistry, Wilson had long been 
involved with the development and 
advancement of visual technology. 
He worked with computer anima-
tion and produced educational 
films for television and his own 
classes. He commissioned the help 
of interested undergraduates and 
led a group that he liked to call the 
"Senses Bureau." 

At the time of his passing, 
Wilson co-directed the Wilson-
Squier Research Group. 

"He really worked with people 
to get them to work on high-risk 
science problems and people were 
often surprised at the results." said 
Jeff Squier, co-director of the 
Wilson-Squier Group, which will 
direct Wilson's research in the 
future. "He was very good at get-
ting people to take their research to 
the next level when they didn't 
think they could. But science was 
secondary; it was all about devel-
oping great people. He tried to seek 
out the best young scientists in the 
world and made them really reach 
in their research and tried to get 
them to grow personally.· • 

Friends said it was his diversi-
ty of interests and abilities that 
made Wilson stand out from 
other professors. 

"Kent was an extraordinary 
individual - a brilliant scientist, 
teacher and innovator with broad 
interests ranging from the environ-
ment to economics as weU as sci-
entific inquiry: said Edward 
Dennis, chair of the chemistry and 
biochemistry department. "Kent 
always had a unique perspective on 
life and was filled with enthusiasm 
as he constantly explored new 
dimensions and sought new expe-

-.nences. Kent's memory will live on 
as an inspiration to everyone he 
touched. We will miss him deeply." 

Memorial services for W.JsOn 
will take place on Sunday, April 9 at 
2 p.m. at the Unitarian Universalist 
Fellowship of San Dieguito.

Davis Student Dies After Alcohol Binge 
IIJ MIKE McDANIEL 
The California Aggie 

(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. -
David Thornton, a UC-Davis 
senior who was expected to gradu-
ate in' 2001, died early Tuesday 
morning from an apparent alcohol 
overdose. 

According to Lt. Don Brooks of 
the Davis Police taken to Sutter 
Davis Hospital at 11 :50 on Monday 
night after he stopped breathing. At 
12:13 on Tuesday morning, he was 
pronounced dead. 

Early reports indicate that 
Thornton's blood alcoholleve1 was 
well above the legal limit. 

News of the death shook the 
UC Davis campus, which is still 
trying to recover from a tragic 
research boating accident that 
occurred during spring break. 

"I'm very sadly here once again 
... [David's death] compounds the 
grief we've felt during the last 
week: UCD Chancellor Larry 
Vanderhoef said Tuesday after-
noon. "This is especially painful 
because David was - like all stu-
dents - a person of great potential. 

"He was an excellent student 
and I want to express condolences 
to both his family and friends: 
Vanderhoef added. 

According to Brooks, details 
about the evening are still unclear. 

"He was out celebrating his 21 st 
birthday: Brooks said. "We under-
stand he was in the downtown area 
... our investigation is still continu-
ing. We would encourage anyone 
who may have seen something to 

give us a call." 
Brooks said Thornton was at 

The Paragon on the night of his 
death. 

"We know that he was there at 
one point but we don't know 
whether or not he went anywhere 
else: he said. "We're still trying to 
backtrack his activities at this 
point." 

Brooks added that the DPD is 
still trying to determine exactly 
where and with whom Thornton 
was drinking. 

Carol Wall, vice chancellor of 
student affairs, said that Thornton 
was well liked by his friends and 
peers. 

"[Thornton] is described by his 
friends as being ... someone who's 
always in a good mood, someone 
who you wanted to be your friend: 
Wall said. 

Wall also mentioned that many 
programs are available for students 
interested in learning about the 
hazards of binge drinking. 

"Binge drinking is one of the 
things we need to deal with: she 
said. "None of the programs can 
bring Dave back, but we do believe 
that we must continue our efforts 
[to educate the student body]." 

Michelle Famula, director of the 
Cowell Student Heath Center, said 
that although alcohol education is 
not mandatory for students, there 
are a number of educational 
opportunities for students on cam-
pus. 

MWe have a number of different 
programs in development," she 
said. "[We're trying) to increase 

outreach into areas where [people 
believe] high risk drinking is social-
ly acceptable." 

Famula added that UCD is cur-
rently pan of a national study 
examining binge drinking. 

During his time at UCD, 
Thornton majored in biological 
sciences and had accumulated a 
3.36 grade point avcrage. In fall 
1997, Thornton cnrolkd in the 
Davis Honors Challenge, a cam-
puswide program for highly moti-
vated students intercsted in 
enhancing their educ8tion through 
special courses, closer contact with 
faculty and dynamic interaction 
with academic peers. 

Teaching assistant Mark Renz, 
who assisted with Biologica l 
Sciences 1 C last fall , recalls 
Thornton as an "incredibly bright 
and intelli~e nt student who worked 
very well I.ndependently with httle 
assIstance. 

In addition to his academic pur-
suits, Thornton worked at ASUCD 
Campus Copies and was a member 
of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. 

According to Janet Gong, assis-
tant vice chancellor of student 
affairs, there is no indication that 
Thornton's birthday celebration 
was a fraternity sponsored event. 

"[There is] no reason to believe 
that this event was connected to 
this fraternity: she said. "At this 
time. it's inappropriate to assume 
that the fraternitv was involved." 

Thornton was from Fresno, 
Calif. He had turned 21 on 
Monday.

find solace in their studies or con-
tinue their libertine lifestyle in an 
atte'!lp! to relive that initial 
moment of ecstasy. However, there 
is always a minority that follows the 
good old path mainstreamed by 
Kerouac of going Mon the road." 

Perhaps the decision to leave 
college either temporarily or per-
manendy is a final one. Then again , 
many just need the time to get the 
proverbial "thumb" out of them-
selves. Interestingly, the destination 
to their road trip is often filled with 
ambiguity and ambivalence. Ask 
somebody who is about to take one 
of these personal quests and his or 
her answer will usually follow on 
the lines of "I don't know. I have to 
leave (thoughtful pause of intro-
spection) just somewhere." 

For those planning on one of 
these trips, this article suggests 

another expansion of their bound-
aries by offering various interna-
tional destinations this month and 
how to get there. 
.,.. 

Money is the main ingredient in 
determimng where one can or can-
not go. Therefore, international 
traver (barring Mexico and Canada) 
is often considered unreachable. 
However, the availability of cheap 
tickets have become drastically eas-
ier to obtain through the Internet. 
And in response, various travel 
agencies have followed suit. 

Council navel located in the 
Price Center offers great rates during 
various times of the year. Call 452-
0630 for more infonnation. 
Depending on the time of the year as 
well as a little luck, a ticket to France 
could cost as little as $500 or less. In 
a sense working less than.two wttks 
at McDonalds could send you on a 
trip to Hemingway's Paris. 

Ground zero for the cheapest 
airline tickets is still through the 
Internet though. Web sites such as 
lUWW. travtlsalpe.com search the Web 
for the cheapest available tickets 
while you wait in the convenience of 
your home. This site also offers gen-
eral hints on how to hunt for the 
tickets through the Web such as 
registering for airline e-mail lists 
that offer weekly specials on airfare. 
If the Internet's prices still digs too 
deep into the pockets. then flying as 
an air courier might be the solution. 

Air couriers transport interna-
tionally bound parcels by carrying 
them as luggage through regular 
commercial airlines, in essence -

Robert Do~ney Jr. Directed by 
James Toback. 

View: This film will be interest-
ing and engaging for most audi-
ences due to the rather original 
background story abou t the fasci-
nation that some white teenagers 
have with urban hip hop culture-
that, and the scene with Tyson 
slapping Downey in the face.

strangers discover that their lives 
are intertwined by fate. 

Cast: DaVid Duchovny, Minnie

Plot: This film follows the life of

choice for this role. He'll no doubt 
bring a strong presence to the roll 
of the father.

Plot: This experimental movie tells the 
story of casting a play in Los Angeles, even 
as earthquake aftershocks shake the city. 

Cast: Saffron Burrows, Salma Hayek, 
Holly Hunter, Kyle MacLa'chlan, Laurie 
Metcalf, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Steven 
Weber. Directed by Mike Figgis. 

VItW: This film is dubbed "experimental" 
because it is the first film to have been shot 
in a single take. It was recorded with four 
digital cameras that were running in syn-
chronous time, following the actors as they 

~orm the entire movie. It's an exciting 
Idea for a film.

Plot: When a police officer receives a ham

to his father in 1969 ... before he died. The 
two strike up a quick frien'dship and soon 
become partners across time to see if they

Cast: Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Andre 
Braugher, Michael Cera, Shawn Doyle, 
Noah Emmerich, Daniel Henson and Eliza-
beth Mitchell. Directed by Gregory Hoblit. 

VItW: If time travel is too much of a 
stretch for your imagination, consider this 
film . Talking through time on a ham radio 
- it's a clever idea and both actors are well-
established, but it's questionable whether 
"Frequency" will leave a lasting impression 
with audiences.

Plot: Novalee Nation, a pregnant teenag-

er from Tennessee running away to Califor-
nia with her boyfriend, finds herself aban-
doned at a Waf-Mart store in Oklahoma. 
During her pregnancy, she befriends an 
array of caring women all intent on helping 
her through. 

Cast: Natalie Portman, Stockard Chan-
ning. Joan Cusack, Keith David, Sally Field 
and Ashley Judd. Directed by Matt Williams. 

VItW: It's an interesting story, but it's hard 
to tell whether it will leave a lasting impres-
sion. (Anyone remember "Anywhere But 
Here"?) 

Plot: A man goes out on the road to "look 
for himself," but when he doesn't return 
home, his wife begins to worry. Soon she's 
retracing his footsteps in an attempt to track 
him down. 

Cast: Heather Graham, Luke Wilson,Jon 
Stewart, Casey Affleck, Goran Visnjic, Patri-
cia Velazquez, Alfonso Arau, Kim Dickens

ing for an important potential client to stop 
by - "the big kahuna" - they find them-
selves opening up in unexpected ways. 

Cast: Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and 
Peter Facinelli. Directed by John Swanbeck. 

View: This is the sort of role that Spacey 
really excels at (consider "Glengarry Glen 
Ross" and "The Ref') and DeVito and 
Facinelli are excellent supporting actors.

Plot: Pedro Paulo is a struggling Brazilian 

lawyer, surrounded by failed romance. Mary 
Ann is an American English teacher, living 
and working in Rio de Janiero, still recover-
ing from the loss of her husband two years 
earlier. Alone and unhappy, both have near-
ly given up hope of finding their lifelong 
soulmate. 

Cast: Amy Irving, Alexandre Borges, 
Antonio Fagundes, Pedro Cardoso, Stephen 
Tobolowsky, Debora Bloch and Drica 
Moraes. Directed by Bruno Barreto. 

Viw: There's very little to go on about 
this film as yet but the press release 
describes it well: "Set amidst the enchanting 
landscape of Rio de Janeiro, Bossa Nova is a 
fresh, multicultural love story that captures 
the playful innocence of romance in all its 
disguises."

Plot: This film studies the physical and 

emotional intricacies affecting the everyday

shaping the way they live. 

Cast: Glenn Close, Cameron Diaz, Calista 
Flockhart, Kathy Baker, Amy Brenneman, 
Gregory Hines and Holly Hunter. Directed 
by Rodrigo Garcfa. 

View: Finally, it's the white-washed 
"Waitins to Exhale"rjoy Luck Club." An 
impresSIve cast of actresses will no doubt 
generate a very pOwerful film.

Plot: A popular high school 
cheerleader becomes pregnant with 
the star quarterback's child, only to 
find herself turning to crime to 
suppon the lifestyle she wants to 
live. 

Cast: Marley Shelton, james 
Marsden, Mena Suvari, Sean 
Young, Marla Sokoloff and Alexan-
dra Holden . Directed by Francine 
McDougall. 

View: This is another film with 
very little to go on. This comedy 
seems to be another vehicle for 
younger unknown actors to get 
some recognition with Suvari along 
to add some star weight to the film. 

Plot: A canoonist is put into a 
coma following a car accident and 
ends up in his own creation. He 
must escape in t 2 hours before 
Death claims him. He teams up 
with his character, Monkeybone, to 
escape from his comic and return

someday overthrowing atien control. 

Cast: john lhIvolta, Barry Pep-
per, Forest Whitaker, Kim Coates, 
Sabine Karsenti, Richard 'lYson, 
Marie-Josie Croze and Kelley Pre-
ston. 

V'/tW: This is the cinematic real-
ization of L. Ron Hubbard's book 
of the same name. The effects and 
explosions seen in the trailer 
denote high-energy action, but this 
is. a tricky field to master especially 
when it comes to sci-Ii. The jury is 
still out on passing judgment on 
this film .

Plot: This film follows the effortS 

of a group of teenagers studying

Travel: 
Air courier services ease 
international transport 

legal smugglers. Apparently, this is 
cheaper than delivering them as 
"air cargo." The urban legend of 
traveling in the storage compan-
ments of planes is just that, a myth. 
For the most part, couriers .do not 
get free tickets to exotic destina-
tions, though, they do receive a 50 
percent to 80 percent discount on 
all flights they fly as a courier. A 
ticket to London can cost as low as 
$99 and one to Tokyo discounted 
to $250. Pree tickets do sporadical-
ly occur if a sudden cancellation is 
made and another courier is need-
ed immediately. 

How does one become an air 
courier? Registering with the Air 
Courier Association guarantees 
acceptance once the age requV'e-
ment (21 years) has been met, but 
registering with commercial courier 
services also accomplishes the same 
objective. Although this might seem 
like an ideal way to travel, there are 
numerous exceptions that follow. 
For instance. most flights are given 
a stay period of one to two weeks in 
which couriers must leave at the 
allotted time since the majority of 
airplanes also carry parcels on the 
outbound flight as well. Rights t6 
Asia and South America generally 
allow for a longer stay. Additionally, 
baggage becomes an issue since the 
courier is expected to carry the par-
cel as luggage. This usually leaves 
the courier space for one carry-on 
bag unless he or she wishes to pay 
an additional fee to the airlines 
($35-$80). Call (800) 282-1202 or 
visit www. a;rr:ourier.com for more 
information. 
EMIt: La Peria De Sevilla 
Date: April 30-May 6, 2000 
Locatitm: Various locations around 

Seville, Spain 
SYfII1JISis: Every spring. Seville 
throws a week long festival with over 
one million participants. La Feria De 
Sevilla was first a cattle trading fair in 
1847. Today's modem festival has 
evolved into a scintillating spectacle 
filled with flamenco, bullfighting and 
overall hedonism the way only the 
Spanish know how to do. C\assical 
enthusiasts should already be famil-
iar with term ·Sevillana: which 
stands for flamenco music and cul-
ture. The citizens of Seville as well as 
many others believe the city to be 
the true binhplace for flamenco's 
explosion into the world. 

The center of Feria's festivities 
actually lie outside of Seville in a 
temporary city on the hinterlands 
of Rio Guadalquivir, otherwise 
known as MReal de la Feria," This 
city is composed of brightly striped 
tents (casetas) decorated with thou- . 
sands of paper lanterns on a mile-
long parcd of land. Although these 
castU/s were originally intended for 
the cattle fair, they have trans-
formed into mini dance halls that 
teach flamenco from sunset to 
early the next morning. Most of the 
participating women in La Feria 
wear extravagant Gypsy-inspired, 
multi-colored designs. 

The most famous caStta, MEr 77" 
is notorious for drawing wine from 
a well and pouring them from 
buckets to goblets or sometimes 
straight into a person's mouth. Por 
those who drank too much from 
the w.ell, cots are offered in the 
back for people to "sleep." Another 
tent named ~Los Duendes de Sevil-
la" named after a popular painting 
by national Alvarez Quintero o(:on-
tinues the theme of dancing and 
drinking, offering shots of sherry to 
all who enter. However, it is the 
casttas sponsored by the various 
leftist and anarchist groups that 
offer the most extreme forms of . 
debauchery.

the most intense expressions of 
Spanish culture and art.

LoaItiora: Ouanazate, Morocco 
5)Inopsis: 26 miles is for sissies in 
this - weeklong. 146-mile trek 
through the Sahara desert. Con-
sidered the toughest footrace on 
Eanh, 500 competitors from 30 
countries will gather on the edges 
of Ourzazte, Morocco to test the 
limits of human endurance. The 
marathon's hard-core mantle is 
upheld with its strict stipulations: 
1) All competitors must carry their 
own gear, food and water. Among 
the gear, a sleeping bag, anti-
venom pump and survival kit is 
required to panicipate in the race. 
2) Only a ration of nine liters of 
water and an open-sided Berber 
tent will be provided daily to com-
petitors. 

The race itself is panitioned into 
six stages that vary in length year to 

year. However, there is always a 26 
mile Mmarathon" stage and a non-
stop, 50-mile stage in which com-
petitors have 40 hours to finish. 
The terrain covers rocky plateaus. 
sand dunes. lake beds and the occa-
sional village. Temperatures range . 
from 110" P during the day to 4O"P 
during the night, not to mention 
the constant possibility of sand-
storms, rain or flooding. 

Although this might seem like a 
race for the young and incredibly 
fit, many who enter have never 
raced in a marathon before, let 
alone this physical behemoth. The 
oldest competitor to have ever fin-
ished the race was in 1996 where 
76-year-old Claude Compain fin-
ished 525th overall with a time just 
under 60 hours. 

European media coverage is 
intense. giving the sarne/ublicity 
and prestige of the Worl Cup in 
some countries. Watching the faces 
of men and women on the verge of 
exhaustion and quite literally, run-
ning for -their lives makes regu1ar 
marathons seem like a romp 
through the city. 

The race includes a search and 
rescue team that is on alen 24 
hours. There has been one instance 
of a lost runner who started in 
Morocco and ended up somewhere 
in Algeria. 

After the race, all competitors 
enjoy the luxury of a five star hotel 
where they recover like kings with a 
banquet complete with soldiers, 
camels and white Arabian horses. 
The banquet and race concludes 
with an awards ceremony in which 
outstanding competitors are distin-
guished for their achievement.

EWfJt: Koninginnedag (Queen's 
Day) 
Da: April 28-29, 2000 
LocIIIion: Amsterdam, Netherlands 
SYfII1JISis: The mother of all parties 

Thursday, April 6, 2000 

- 24 hours of eating, drinking. 
smoking, dancing. shopping and 
everything else one might associate 
with this Red Light District city. 
Celebrating the Queen's binhday, 
Amsterdam holds the world's 
largest free market where ' the 
entire city is opened to thousands 
of visitors and reveling locals. 
Everyone is allowed to sell any-
thing this day, malting the party 
seem like the world's largest garage -
sale. Live bands, trendy transves-
tites and boatloads of drunk and 
dru$&ed up people fill the streets 
to slOg national anthems and folk 
songs. 

"I've never seen a whole coun-
try shut down andlarty like they 
do in Holland; sai Ivan Small, a 
visitor to the festival. ~Everyone 
wears orange [the country's 
national color), and every bar and 
street comer has bands playing, 

. while people guzzle Heineken in 
the streets and boats of dancing 
revelers clog the canals. Even the 
trams are shut down because the 
streets are so full of partiers and 
empty beer cups." 

This national birthday party has 
been an annual event since 1948 
when Queen Juliana succeeded the 
Dutch throne as the second Dutch 
queen in the country's history. Her 
daughter, Juliana, who eventually 
succeeded her established the 
birthday as a national event. Tradi-
tionally, the Queen visits two towns 
each year as symbol of nationalism. 
This year, the Queen is scheduled 
to appear in Katwijk and Leiden 
where singing, dancing and tradi-
tional Dutch games will be part of 
the festivities. 

Since then, Queen's Day has 
been one of the greatest excuses for 
citizens of surrounding countries to 
ditch their job for a day and down a 
Heine with the Queen in world's 
most lenient and liberal city. VISit

Film: 
Orphan dinosaur saves 
the human race 

MAY 19 
.... 'hIII 

Plot: Four friends take off on a 
l000-mile trip across the country 
from Ithaca, New York to Austin, 
Texas. The reason the guys are on the 
road is to get to one boy's girlfriend 
before she receives a certain sex-filled 
videotape mistakenly mailed to her. 
It's a teen road comedy for the 2000s. 

Cast: Breckin Meyer, OJ. Qualls, 
Sean W. Scott, Rachel Blanchard, 
Paolo Costanzo, Andy Dick, Tom 
Green, Amy Smart and Fred Ward. 
Directed by Todd Phillips. 

VItW: Green had me at, "Hey, you 
wanna see a movie?" during the teas-
er trailer for this film. Looks to be a 
classic brainless/disgusting comedy. 

11_ 
Plot: At the end of the dinosaur 

age a young Iguanodon is separated 
from his parents and raised by 
lemurs. The orphan learns that a 
giant asteroid is heading toward 
Earth. While other dinosaurs decide 
to ignore the big rock, this dinosaur 
leads his friends, the lemurs, to safety. 

Cast: D.B. Sweeney, Ossie Davis, 
Julianna Margulies, Joan Plowright, 
Della Reese, Kiefer Sutherland,Alfre 
Woodard, Max Casella, Daryl Bruce 
and Jonathan Harris. Directed by 
Eric Leighton and Ralph Zondag. 

VIeW: The completely computer-
rendered characters set against the live 
action background is fantastic. Plus, the 
idea that the dinosaur in "Dinosaur" 
saves the lemurs (which, no doubt, 
evolve into humans) is funny. 
................ 

Plot: Five stories related to each 
of the five senses interconnect./The 
five senses are represented oy a 
voyeur, a man who is losing his 
hearing due to old age, a massage 
therapist, a house-cleaner with an 
acute sense of smell and a baker 
who has lost her sense of taste. 

Cast: Mary-Louise Parker, Pas-
cale Bussieres, Brendan Fletcher, 
Marco Leonardi, Nadia Litz, 
Daniel Maclvor, Molly Parker, 
Gabrielle Rose and Philippe Volter. 
Directed by Jeremy Podeswa. 

View: Think "Four Rooms" 
meets "The Sixth Sense." (O.K., not 
exactly.) Nevertheless, it's a clever 
idea and this cast of unknowns

dream of the perfect scheme: a 
bank robbery. 

Cast: Woody Allen, Tracey Ull-
man, Hugh Grant, Jon Lovitz,

Directed by Woody Allen. 

VIeW: Clearly this isn't much of a 
departure for an Allen film , but the 
cast is interesting. 

MAY 26 
III ..... : 11IIPO ....... 2 

Plot: This time around, Ethan

release of a German virus by terrorists. 

Cast: Tom Cruise, Brendan Glee-
son, Anthony Hopkins, Thandie 

ewton, Ving Rhames, Dougray 
Scott, Rade Serbedzija and Steve 
Zahn. Directed by John Woo. 

VIeW: This will probably be one 
of the most hyped films of the sea-
son. It's understandable, however, 
considering the formula for the film . 
Between Woo, Cruise and Hopkins, 
there is a great chance this sequel 
will outperform its predecessor. 

................. 
Plot: This is the true story of 

Joseph Ferdinand Gould, who lived 
on the streets of New York City for 
40 years, focusing on the 1940s and 
1950s. Gould was a bohemian 
eccentric who claimed to be writing 
an opus called "An Oral History of 
our Times." 

Cast: Ian Holm, Stanley Tucci, 
Patricia Clarkson, Hope Davis, 
Steve Martin, Susan Sarandon, 
Halle Hirsh and Ben Shenkman. 
Directed by Stanley Tucci. 

View: If you're only able to see 
one film this season, consider this 
one. If you're not convinced, rent 
"Big Night" or "The Impostors." 
Both are brilliant films by the same 
company . 

........ Noon 
Plot: The Emperor's former 

Captain of the Chinese Imperial 
Guard Lo Fong, with plans to 
become an international opium 
dealer, concocts a scheme where

Pei Pei is kidnapped and brought to 
America's "Wild West." Fong is 
pursued by an acrobatic member of 
the Chinese Imperial Guard, Chon 
Wang, who teams up with a rascal-
ly train robber, Roy O'Bannon. 

Cast: Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, 
Lucy Liu, Rodger Yuan and Curtis 
Armstrong. Directed by Tom Dey. 

View: Think "Rush Hour" meets 
"Wild, Wild West," but good. =-)

GUNS: 
La:-vsuits are merery thinry 

v~kda~p~atro~dOn 

checks are practical responses to 
the problems that arise from gun 
ownership. Increasing the care 
taken in performing background 
checks will help limit the number 
of criminals who are able to 
acquire guns. Requiring gun safe-
ty locks will serve to reduce the 
number of gun related deaths that 
result from accidents in the home. 

~owever, the lawsuits brought 
agamst gun manufacturers are far 
less admirable. In many cases the 
st~tes are merely using the law-
SUIts as a strong arm tactic to force 
gun manufacturers to include 
safetr locks on their new models, 
offenn$ gu~ manufacturers legal 
protectron In exchange for their 
cooperation. Government officials 

s~oul~ not ~e threatening compa-
~lJes mto Implementing these 
Important safety precautions, but 
should rather be working for gov-
ernment mandates. The automo-
bile industry was not bullied into 
including vital safety features like 
seatbelts and airbags in their vehi-
cles with the threat of a govern-
ment lawsuit, but rather by safety 
regulations enforced the federal 
government. 

The very legal premise of these 
lawsuits are questionable. City 
and state governments are trying 
to hold gun manufacturers liable 
for the actions of their con-
sumers. Crimes involving firearms 
~o no~ represent any negligence 
In deSIgn or manufacturing that 
c.an be blamed on the company ' 
that made the gun. 

The responsibility for criminal 
actions lies squarely with the per-
son who committed the crime 
not with the company that pro~ 
vided him with the means of 
doing so. If anything, the fault lies 
with the governments that are 
supposed to provide for the pro-
tection of their citizens from 
criminals acts. No level of govern-
ment h~s th~ authority to punish 
companres SImply for providing a 
product the ownership of which is 
defended by the Constitution. 

The time may some day come 
when the ownership of firearms 
by private citizens will no longer 
be tolerated in America. Just as 
the United States has come to rely 
on a professional military, we have 
also become increasingly depen-
dent on professional law enforce-
ment agencies for domestic secu-
rity. Personal defense may cease to 
be a personal privilege and 
become a service provided solely 
by. the state. Until that times actu-
ally comes and the right to bear 
arms is no longer protected by the 
Constitution, however, attempts 
to sue firearm manufacturers for 
the government's own failure to 
control crime and gun violence is 
unethical and ultimately illegal.

Watanabe: 
Triton swimmer began 
swimming at age three 

went to San Diego I would be clos-
er to home for birthday parties and 
family get-togethers, but she 
wouldn't mind if I went to 
Washington. She asked if I really 
wanted to go through all of those 
months of rain. I thought about it, 
and I guess I am too used to the 
sun." 

Luckily for UCSD and unfortu-
nately for every other school, 
Watanabe chose to become a 
Triton. 

Watanabe ended a fantastic sea-
son in amazing order, dominating 
at the NCAA Division III 
Championships in Atlanta last 
month. 

Watanabe won the 200-yard 
backstroke, SOD-yard freestyle, 
400-yard individual medley and 
anchored the winning SOD-yard 
freestyle relay team. She was also 
named outstanding swimmer of 
the meet and led all individual 
swimmers with 60 points. 

"This year was good because it 
was all new competition: she said. 
"I had never seen any of it before. It 
was interesting to see how I would 
perform. I was used to the same 
competition. I like to race against 
good competition. It helps me to do 
my best when I know there is some-
one I need to beat to help my team." 

Watanabe may continue r !:! 
winning ways this summer. 

"There is a junior national meet 
in the summer: she said . "I might 
go. I don't know yet. There will be 
good competition there. I'll be 
training for that. 

With four national champi-
onships under her belt, Watanabe 
already has plans for next season. 

"Next year, we're moving to 
Division II. That's a start," 
Watanabe said. "I guess swimming 
is good because it's more of an 
individual thing, where you can 
always improve your own time. It's 
not so much the accomplishments 
and everything, just how you do by 
yourself." 

Image: 
Some professional sports 
lack personality and fans 
that is nothing more than a bunch 
of personalities playing for them-
selves. Sure, Shaq O'neal , Kobe 
Bryant, Grant Hill , Vince Carter 
and Allen Iverson are big names 
in today's basketball scene, but it 
is not how it was in the era of 
Michael Jordan . People who never 
even heard of basketball knew of 
Jordan. With his all-time skill, 
flashy dunks and smile, combined 
with being on every other televi-
sion commercial, His Airness was 
more well-known than many 
presiden IS. 

Dennis Rodman may be the 
most famous character ever in bas-
ketball. Now, I would take Shaq's 
or Carter's play over the Worm any 
time, but I do admit I miss the 
excentric one. You never knew 
what may happen in a game he par-
ticipated in. 

Charles Barkley used to be some-
one who gave the league a personal-
ity. He would speak first and think 
later, which made for great quotes. 

In the '80s, Magic Johnson and 
Larry Bird were the main attrac-
tions. The casual fan would keep 
his or her eyes glued to the TV set 
just to see the two legends go at it. 

Professional sports needs 
something. For the avid, serious 
fan, skill and quality play is just 
fine. For the casual fan, the one 
who pays attention only on occa-
sion, sports needs some personal-
ity. It is a business, and without a 
big-time lure, many professional 
sports will stay in the basement of 
popularity.

However, it has not all been

year. O'Brien said that at the 
beginning of the season, the team 
considered having to put 
Cremidan on the disabled list for 
the year. 

"He had elbow problems and 
we weren't surc~ what was going 
to happen." 

Luckily for the Tritons, 
Cremidan fought through his 
injury and worked hard, and has 
posted a 2-0 win-loss ('ecord this

Tritons Take No 
Break from Wmning 
While much of the campus was relaxi~ the . 
UCSD baseball squad Wll$ burning it s opponents 
By TAIr IlIUD 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team has 
been on a tear of late, ripping apart 
its opposition like a tornado tearing 
through a midwest trailer park. 

Starting just prior to spring 
break and continuing 
through yesterday, the team 
has posted a 6-1 record 
and is averagins 11 runs 
a game in the SIX wins. 

In addition, with 
the loss of ace John 
Beaven to a muscle 
strain for the next cou-
ple of weeks, the pitching 
staff has stepped up and 
delivered with Andy Holloway, 
Alex Cremidan and Brian Hinson 
giving some tip-top perfor-
mances. 

Most recently, however, it was 
Erik Snyder who came through as 
he led the TIitons to a 5-3 win over 
the University of La Verne at home 
this Monday. 

La Verne jumped out to an early 
lead as it went up 1-0 in the top of 
the second on a single by Matt 
Cresto, its third baseman. The 
Thtons came right back, however, 
as joshua Strobl lofted a sac fly to 
score Chris Tallman and tie the 
game 1-1 . 

Holloway held La Verne score-
less in the third inning and the 
Thtons went up 2-1 in the bottom 
half of the inning on some good 
base-running by Todd Scherwin 
and an RBI groundout by Matt 
Merrifield. 

The game was then put out of 
reach by Brian Terrell in the founh 
inning when he hit one over the 
fence in right field for a two-run 
dinger. In the fifth, he brought 
another runner home with a sacri-

fice fly to center field. 
La Verne tried to mount a 

comeback as it scratched out runs 
in the fifth and ninth innings, but 
as the comeback mounted, 
Hinson - UCSO's deRendable 
closer - shut down the La Verne 
bats and the final score was 
recorded as 5-3. 

In previous action, the 
Tritons defeated 
Riverside twice, on 

March 15 and 16. The 
second game, played 
at Riverside, was 
exciting as the TIitons 

scored 16 runs to 
Riverside's 15. Both Chad 

Addison and Tyler Sullivan had 
four RBIs in the game, and Terrell 
along Todd Schrewin each scored 
three runs. 

The TIitons took advantage of 
Riverside's inability to field - the 
Highlanders recorded five errors in 
the game, and UCSD scored 11 
unearned runs. 

"The team really battled out 
there: UCSD Head Coach Dan 
O'Brien said. ·We are a talented 
team and we got the job done: 

In other action, the Thtons 
defeated La Verne 17-6 during the 
break. 

Although this was the game in 
which Beaven sufftred his muscle 
strain, the rest of the team picked 
up the slack, exploding in the 
fourth and eighth innings for five 
runs. Terrell had four RBIs and 
Desi Loessburg. a pinch hitter in 
the game, drove in three. 

In two additional games over 
the break, both Cremidan and 
Holloway gave excellent perfor-
mances. On March 29, Holloway 
pitched a seven-hit shutout vs.

each won their singles matches 6-
O. Gunther and Olsen added an 8-

match. 

The only loss of the season 
came on March 30 at the hands of 
Massachusetts' Williams College, 
which saw four three-set matches 
in the singles portion of play in 
which UCSD won one. 

The women's tennis team 
bounced back with a 9-0 victory 
against the University of San 
Francisco on April 1. 

UCSD's No. 1 player Amy 

Tranckino pulled out a dramatic 
victory against her opponent 
Caroline Tweeton of USF by win-
nillg the match 7-5 in the third 
set. The women went on to take 
the rest of the singles and doubles 
matches. • 

The last match during spring 
break was against UC Davis, 
which UCSD dominated 6-3. 
Gunther won decisively 6-3. 6-1, 
and all the doubles teams came 
through in the clutch. 

Next for UCSD is Pomona-
Pitzer on April 7 and Trinity 
University on April 8; both 
matches are at home at 2 p.m. and 
11 a.m., respectively. 

Both these teams are solid and 
could pose a problem for the 
Thtons. However, laPlante looks 
forward to the challenge and how 

it will effect the team's ranking. 
"If we defeat these teams, we 

will be No. 1 in our region, 
which will give us an easier draw 
at re$ionals: LaPlante said. 
"This IS the first year the women 
have had a regional playoffs. We 
also have to beat Pomona Pitzer 
and Claremont to secure our 
spot." 

With these teams looming in 
its schedule, the Tritons have 
some must-win matches coming 
up. 

"The team is looking good: 
laPlante said. "We are going to 
make some changes in the singles 
line-up and try not to change it too 
much again before regionals. 
Overall, we are anxious to see how 
we perform in our upcoming 
matches." 

The great taste goes best with a meal where someone saves you a seat,

Woods Briligs Life' To 
Dry Sports World 

The 2000 Master's golf tourna-
ment is coming up this weekend, 
and as usual. all eyes are on Tiger 
Woods. 

I've been thinking about what a 
truly great phenomenon Woods is. 
This young man, with skill beyond 
his time and a refreshing vigor of 
youth, has single-handedly saved 
golf. 

Woods burst onto the scene a 
few years ago and took not only the 
golf world but also the world of 
professional sportS by storm. 
Before he came along, many people 
couldn't even name a single golfer. 
This is not to say that there were 
no golfers worth mentioning, but 
the names of Jack Nicklaus and 
Arnold Palmer were not in every-
one's living room. 

Woods, through a stellar pro-
motional campaign by the PGA 
and his various sponsors, is now a 
household name. ow. golf and 
Woods are popular to talk about 
at the dinner table. In the past, the 
subjects of golfers and golf would 
have produced nothing but 
yawns. 

This is not only what golf need-
ed, but this is what sports needs all 
around. Sports needs personality. it 
needs something to sell, something 
to appeal to the casual fan . 

Tennis is a good example. Men's 
tennis used to have character in the 
days when John McEnroe and 
Jimmy Connors battled. Today, 
there is very little pizzazz in men's 
tennis. The sport is now just strong 
guys hitting the ball as hard as they 
can, then smiling or frowning. 
There is Andre Agassi, who has 
been known to be flamboyant . His 
maturity has grown as a player, and 
not coincidenta lly his ski ll, and he 
is not as rambunctious as before. 

Women's tennis, on the other 
hand, is taking off. Martina Hingis, 
with her skills and whiny attitude, 
has earned the nickname of Swiss 
Miss. Lindsey Davenport, with her 
all-American character and No. 1 
ranking, is certainly popular. The 
Williams' pair of Serena and Venus 
is renound. The sisters have taken 
the tennis world by storm. Their 
flamboyant style is only surpassed 
by their superior skill. Finally, Anna 
Kournikova, be it appropriate or 
not, is very popular to the male 
fans for her good looks and has 
had many a picture taken of her. 

This is what other sports are 
lacking - this character that both 
men's golf and women 's tennis have. 

Take women's golf for example. 
Name more than two women 
golfers who are playing today. 
Time's up. Women's golf needs 
someone like Woods or 
Kournikova to put the sport on the 
map. Until then, it will just Qe 
Yawnsville and filler in the even ing 
sports report. 

This goes for other sports as 
well. They should allow a little bit 
of showboating in football. End-
zone dances to celebrate touch-
downs would be great. Instead , the 
National Football League insists on 
keeping its faceless, mask-covered 
players from showing much emo-
tion, garnering nicknames such as 
the No Fun League. 

Basketball is plagued, as well. 
There is no personafity in a league

PORTS 
A Fruitful Spring Break 
The women's tennis team had a fantastic run last week, going 6-1 to increase its record to 13-1 
By ARVIND YUAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team continued its dominance 
over the competition by going, 
6-1 in its last seven matches, 
extending its record to 13 wins 
and one loss. 

On March 15, the team faced 
Iowa State University - a 
Division I team that was sup-
posed to be practice for l:JCSD's 
upcoming Division III matches. 
Instead, the women played with 
heart' and poise, defeating the 
Cyclones 5-4 at home on the 
north courts. 

Freshman Amy Trackino of 
UCSD defeated Noortje 
Cornelissen in the opening 
match 7-5, 7-6 to give the 
women a crucial point in the 
overall score. Iowa State rallied 
back to win the o. 2 and No.3 
sets, with No. 3 Kristin Gyaki 
defeating o. 3 Yen Yen Ho 6-1 , 
6-2. 

In the end, the matches came 
down to the last doubles team . 
The Triton duo of Kristen Olsen 
and Rachel Gunther came out 
victorious against Iowa State's 
Tara Goedjen, and Sharla 
Whitaker to break a tie and give 
UCSD the victory. 

"We knew Iowa was going to 
be a tough match, but we had 
nothing to lose since [it is[ 
Division I," UCSD women's 
tennis Head Coach Liz LaPlante 
said. 

"The Pomona wins gave us a 
ton of confidence, and we knew 
we could win if we played well ," 
LaPlante continued. "In dou-
bles, they were a little more 
aggressive and j ust had better 
serves and volleys. Our No. 3 
team hasn't lost all year and has 
won easily. In singles, however, 
we were steadier and played with 
more confidence. Obviously, our 
depth has paid off. Amy's win at 
No.2 was huge and a great win

for her.~ 

The next match took place 
March 17 against Skidmore 
College, a Division III rival. UCSD 
played smart and took advantage of 
important points to win 8-1 against 
Skidmore. 

The only downfall of the com-
petition took place during the No. 
2 singles match, when freshman 
Melissa Liao was forced to retire 

due to a shoulder injury. The 
score was 0-6, 6-2, 4-2 when Liao 
decided that she could not carry 
on , giving Skidmore its only 
point. 

"Our decisive victory over 
Slcidmore was a bit of a surprise." 
LaPlante said. "They finished No. 4 
in the country last year. However, 
they graduated a strong senior, and 
one of their top players is abroad in 

England .~ 
After the positive outcome of its 

last two matches, UCSD proceeded 
to defeat Pacific Lutheran 
University 9-0 at home on the 
north courts. 

UCSD played with confidence 
and composure, heightened by 
seniors Ho and Kelli Tsai , who

Watanabe Makes a Huge Splash for the UCSD Swim Team 
Freshman had a big first year, capping her rookie season with four championships at nationals 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

On this campus of nearly 
20,000 students, there are some 
good athletes and some great ath-
letes. 

The swim team's Jennifer 
Watanabe falls into the latter cate-
gory. 

Watanabe, student at Muir 
College, tore up the water with 
smooth strokes and forceful kicks 
this swimming season. 

"My whole life I've been full-
time swimming," the 18-year-old 
freshman said . "Mornings, 
evenings, weekends and holidays: 

Watanabe, like many accom-
plished swimmers, started when 
she was very young. 

"I don't remember when I first 
started taking lessons," Watanabe 
said. "My first race was when I was 
three years old: 

Learning to swim happened to 
be a necessity. 

"My brother swam before me," 
she said. "I would always be 
around the pool, so I needed 
swimming lessons so 1 wouldn't 
accidentally fall in the pool and 
drown: 

When she first came to this 
campus, Watanabe was not neces-
sarily going to join the swim team. 

Watanabe was either 'going to 
join the swim team or the basket-
ball squad. The basketball team 
had a full roster and swimming 
started earlier, so Watanabe ended 
up in the pool instead of on the 
court. 

Like many freshmen, Watan'abe 
had to make a choice before com-
ing to UCSD. 

"After I sent in applications, I 
thought about it," she said. "It was 
between San Diego and 
Washington. I talked it over with 
my mom. She didn 't really care 
which way it went. She said!if I
