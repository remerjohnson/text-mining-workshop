AS/Vice Chancellor's Task 
Force Looks at Health Center 

Armitage, Gerber May Lead Committee 
BY JENNIFER WARREN 

Aaaociate New. Editor 
Vice Chancellor of Student 

Affairs Richard Armitage and 
Associated Students Council 
member Pam Gerber 
announced yesterday the 
formation of an AS/Vice 
Chanellor's task force to 
"examine" the UCSD Health 
Center. 

The task force tentatively 
will be composed of 
representatives from the AS, 
the Graduate Student Council, 
the Women's Center, the 
Disabled Students Union, 
campus police, the Physical 
Education Department, the 
medical school and the 
existing Health Center 
Advisory Committee. 

"We want to get going on 
this right away," said Gerber, 
who will probably chair the 
committee. "There are a lot of 
people who have voiced 

concern about problems 
they've had with the Health 
Center. We've got our work 
cut out for us." 

Among the iuues Gerber 
and Armitage want the task 
force to examine are the 
quality of services offered, the 
center's budget and the range 
of hours and services offered. 

"I see this task force as a 
vehicle for student advice to 
me and the Reg Fee 
Committee regarding the 
status of the Health Center 
and its future," said Armitage. 
"The task force should 
investigate all the problems 
and then report back to us so 
we can act upon their 
discoveries. " 

The formation of the task 
force is not a result of any 
recent outstanding problem, 
said Armitage. 

this vear. 
.... honestly believe we'\Ie 

arrived at a time where we 
need an ongoing Health 
Center Advisory Commitl4e 
composed of faculty, stafi and 
students. The taak force may 
provide the final determination 
of that," said Annitage. 

Former AS Vice President 
Nancy Laga, a .trong 
supporter of the task force, 
hopes it will be more than just 
an investigative body. 

"Students ju.t don't know 
who to contact about 
complaints they have about 
the Health Center," said Laga. 
"We should definitely have a 
formal network through which 
students can go to voice their 
complaints." 

Armitage sugge.ted that 
the task force hold public 

hear~s, at which students 
could 'testify about problem. 
they've had with the Health 
Center." 

VP Mondale Addresses City Club 
9n Critical US ElnergyReso -rces 

"Ever since I arrived here 
an investigation of this sort has 
been at the top of both my 
~iority list and that of the Reg 
Fee Committee, primarily 
because of the tremendous 
cost of health services to 
students," he said. 

S~ghtly over 22 percent of 
student registration fees were 
allotted to the Health Center

Socialist Candidate 
Targets Local Issues 

BY RANDY HILL 
As the Socialist Workers' Party 

candidate for the 43rd Congressional 
District, Mark Frieman claims he is 
"the only positive alternative" to five-
time Repbulican incumbent Claire 
Burgener, and Democratic nominee 
and California Ku Klux Klan Grand 
Dragon Tom Metzger. 

In an interview taped yesterday for 
UCSO'. KSOT radio station, Frieman 
spelled out a broad, liberal platform 
that includes abolition of the US 
military budget, termination of draft 
regi.tration, a federal "jobs for all" 
program, and elimination of sales taxes 
and income taxes on earnings of Jess 
than $40,000 per year. 

F riernan aJao expressed hi. support 
for the Equal Rights Amendment, 
Affirmative ActiOn, Organized Labor, 
and an open US-Me~co border. The 
socialist candidate al,o .tronaly 

opposes nuclear power. 
But Frieman has made Metzger's 

views and Klan affiliation the major 
iuue in his campaign. In fact, Frieman 
explained that the main reason the 
SWP is sponsoring him is the race, is in 
an attempt to prevent Metzger's 
election. 

"The victory of Tom Metzger posed 
the ctuestion, 'what do you do now?' 
The Socialist Workers Party now sees 
this as a veryimportantrace," Frieman 
said. 

Frieman lashed out repeatedly at 
Metz,er's anti-labor, pro-draft and 
raci.t policies. He also accused the 
Democratic Party of allowing Metzger 
to win the primary, by not exposing 
Metzger's political view.. Frieman

Cold, 
Wet 
And New 

By 
Keith Grant-Davie 

Keith Grant·Davie, on 
exchartle from England, is 
a graduate student in 
literature. 

Almost everyone 
reading this article has had 
the experience of arriving at 
a university for the fir.t time 
at an undergraduate. This 
happened to me four years 
ago in Exteter, a city in the 

..rurailOuthwest of England, 
where I apent three years 
studying for .a BA in English literature. 

1he first weeks of the term paaaed in a whirl of activity. As 
freshmen, we were made to feel like feted guests, and after we 
had stood. in line for various stages of registration, we were 
entertained with discos, concerts and parties. Booklets had . 
been compiled to introduce us to city and campus. Stencilled 
fliers swished under our doors offering religious fellowship . 
Clube and societies competed for our allention at. the _ 
Freahers' Squash, our chaotic indoor equivalent of UCSD' •... 
Bizarre Bazaar. We were the slars and everyone.. w.as ,: 
anxious to welcome us . I' .• 'I" •. , ••• ,:_ 

But we were as anxious to be welcomed, and eager to 
belong. Impulsively, we would sign up to join du1», 
seldom attended more than the first meeting or two. 

I was keen and excited as anyone. Having spent the Iong;-
dry summer in relative isolation working in Paris, I WBI ready 
for a return to a busy student community. The university 
seemed 10 oHer limitleas potential. With a fresh start, amongst 
new friends , I felt I had the perfect chance to take on a new 
identity, to Blsume a better personality that was free of the old 
faults. 

I remember .tanding in my little dormitory room for the first 
time, with my cues and carlon. before me on the polished 
linoleum Roor, looking at the gray brick wall. and the rain 
falling outaide on a .teer' grusy hilllide. The skinny Roor mat 
and thin upholatery 0 the bed and easy chair did little 10 
relieve the eslential, oppretllive hardness and angularity of 
the stand illue furniture and fittings . The buUetin board was 
blank except for a typed Inventory and a page of fire 
regulation •. The shell of a room only, it was desperately in 
need of peraonalization. Emlpying my baggage, I gave top 
priority to the stereo, and tried to get used 10 seeing familiar 
things in the alien aetting. 

To a greater or leiter extent, all of u. suffered from 
insecurity, needing friends and fearing rejection, but not 
wanting it to show. I had committed myself ab.oludy to the 
pace and action of the first week. and conaequendy rode the 
emotional wavea that rolled over them. 

The high. were fine, but depression would desc~ if I 
found myaelf out of touch with my lenuoua group of new 
friends. I would worry in cue I had been left out of the action . 
It was an un.table time, when happiness teemed to depend on 
being in the right place at the right time with the right people. 
A great deal of energy wu expended 10 sustain all three of 
these conditions and needleaa anxiety resulted whenever the 
attempt failed. 

Habit and routine tend to have a stabilizing influence, and 
the emotional creall and troughs that marked the beginning of 
my freahman year slowly began to Rallen out. Work wu 
demanding more of my attention, and u my friends and 
college activities became more familiar, I began to 101e, or at 
leatt to modify, some of my original anticipation of boundles. 
opportunity and unqualified promise. I ... fact, it took me the 
whole of my three yeara at Exeter, and a few hard leaon., 10 
achieve lOme of the goals which I had expected to in.tantly 
adopt, and lOme I am .till working on . 

I count my.elf an optimist ~I, perhapa now more than 
ever, only I feel far better equipped to realiz~ my peraonal 
ambition •. Seeing another school year bePt at UCSD, I 
wonder how it would have been to be an undergraduate here. 
Certainly there would have been differences - I'm lUre it 
wasn't rainint here - but perhap. there are a few similarities 
between freshmen in any country. ..

Iran Uses Paratroops 
Battle For Oil Port 

BAGHDAD, Iraq -
Iranian paratroopers dropped 
into the besieged oil port of 
Khorramshahr where Iranian 
forces were reported in hand· 
to-hand combat with Iraqi 
shock troops for control of the 
city, Iran claimed yesterday. 

In the 11th day of the war, 
with Iran rejecting UN and 
Islamic peace efforts and 
spurning Iraq's oHer of a 
cease·fire, President Abolhas· 
san Bani·Sadr claimed a string 
of victories and said Iraqi 
invaders were being pushed 
back. 

In a broadcast to his armed 
forces, Bani·Sadr called on 
Iranians 10 "escalate their 
struggle" and announced the 
first Ule of paratroopers in the 
war. He said waves of Iranian 
jets launched attacks In

Tehran radio ' .aid Iran's 
parliament named a leven· 
man committee to examine the 
issue of 52 American ho.tages 
who were in their 334th day of 

captivity yesterday. Accord· 
ing to sources in Lebanon, 
four of the committee 
members were hardliners 
likely to oppose release of the 
hostages without a trial. 

There were reports that an 
Iraqi air attack Tuesday 
heavily damaged a $3 billion 
Iranian petrochemical 
complex under construction at 
Bandar Khomeini on the shore 
of the Peraian Gulf. The report 
came from the Mitsui and Co., 
the Japanese partner of Iran in 
the project. 

The war was marked by 
conflicting claims from Tehran 
and Baghdad on the gains 
made and damage inflicted by 
their respective forces, but 
there was little authoritative 
confirmation from the 
battlefront on the rival c1aiml. 

Aaaociated Press Jeffrey 
Ulbrich reported from the Iraqi 
oil pori of Baara that although 
Iraq seized hundreds of square 
miles of Iranian terrilory, Iraq 
had failed to capture any 
major city or achieve a

WASHINGTON - Mi·

"I know now what it leels

Elvis Costello, it is said by 
those who are .upposed to 
know, never plays on .tage for 
more than 45 minutes . He 
plays a brief, intenle let and 
then leaves with the whole 
evening ahead of him. 

The theory is that his 
performance is so con· 
centrated and penetrating that 
the short time allows both 
Costello and the audience to 
reach a sustained peak. 

But wha t if the band playing 
45 minutes isn't very energetic 
and charges up to $13 for 
tickets ? 

Then you might feel like you 
had been had. 

Such was the case a t 
Monday night 's Sports Arena 
show by the Cars. The pop 
influenced new wavers played 
for only one hour. including 
two encores . 

They played all of their hits 
- a considerable array, 
including "My Best Friends', 
Girl," "Candy.O,'·" Just What 
I Needed" and "Touch and 
Go," the single off their latest 
LP, "Panorama." 

They played professionally 
- so profes.ionally that they 
abandoned creativity and 
opted for the flawless studio 
lOund. of their three ablums. 
Despite the u.ual Sports 
Arena distortion, if you closed 
your eyes, you could have 
been at home li.tening with 
you stereo, joint and intact

New Records From 
Kansas, Eddie Money 
Eddie Money, Playing For Keep. (Columbia). 

This is another very slickly.produced, eminently.listenable 
disc from Money, who has now established himself as one of 
the few vocal stylists in the business equally at home with rock 
'n roll and soft ballads. Money has found his formula for 
success to keep churning out short, biting variations of 'Two 
T ickets to Paradise.' 

'Sa tin Angel' is a case in point, featuring stock Money 
vocal arrangements and the pa t trademark guitar work of his 
sidekick Jimmy Lyon. 'Trinidad ' also closely adheres to this 
magical combina tion of composition, production and 
performance. 

One cut of special merit is 'The W ish,' which a t fi rst listen 
could be mistaken for a Bad Company tune. The texture of 
Eddie Money's voice, Uke tha t of Chuck Mangione's horn, 
has won him many fans due to its soothing, mellow quality. 
All in all, there is enough decent material on this album to 
justify the purchase price. 

Kansas, Audio Vi.ion. (Kirshner). 
Kansas fan. will not be disappointed by this relea.e, in that 

it sounds like every other Kansas record ever recorded. 
Overproduced 'claasically.in8uenced' rock (they said it, not 
I) has been the trademark of this band since its conception. 

Kan.as' mu.ic i. very li.tenable in that they deviate from 
rhythmic rudiments during the course of their compositions 
and insert movements nnon·ordinary ~ipaNres (7/4 
5/11, 1293/16). However, these passage. often disrupt the 
continuity oi their material and serve no purpose other than to 
interrupt the monotony. 

Livgren hal a penchant for writing verses which call for a 
monotonous vocal backed by an acou.tic guitar. This is 
inevitably and abruptly interrupted by the blare of about a 
million decibles worth of heavy metal power chord. which jolt 
the eardrum. Continuous .hell shock does not pass for subtle 
u.e of dynamics in my book.

'Attack of the Killer 
Tomatoes' A Success 
4-D Productions Says No One 
Understood at First 

BY BElli ACCOMANDO 
StaffWri .... 

Imagine this : Average, 
normally docile tomatoes 
.uddenly and without 
apparent reason turn savage 
and cause mass destruction. 
The tomatoes, which grow to 
impres.ive proportions, .oon 
become too much for the local 
authorities to handle, so a 
.pecial taak force headed by 
Mason Dixon i. called in. 

ant of Dixon's agents 
manages to infiltrate the 
enemy camp by disguising 
himself as a killer tomato, and 
he is welcomed into the group. 
At a barbeque he unfortu· 
na tely makes the fatal mistake 
of asking one of the plump 
ve getables to pass the 
ketchup. 

" It was designed to be a wful 
but also to be pure fun ," says 
director John DeBello of his 
film Attack of the Killer 
Tomatoes. " It's a spoof on all 
the roUen movies ever made. 
It's totally without redeeming 
value, and totally uninhibited 
and u.npretenl,ious. 

Killer Tomatoes waa made 
in San Diego in 1977 and 
early 1978 by Four Square 
Productions, an independent 
film company that work. out 
of National City. The film will 
be receiving a special 
screening on Oct. 21 as part of 
the Ken Cinema's salute to 
Hollywood's wor.t, a program 
inspired by Harry and Michael 
Medved'. book The Golden 
Turkey Awards. 

The film was made for a 
quarter of a mimon dollars 
which DeBdlo .ays "would 
pay for Branda's lunch but 
since we didn't use Brando we 

were able to make a whole 
film." The money came 
completely from_ _private 
investors, 10 DeBello, co· 
producer Steven Peace and hi. 
co·authors C.J. Dillon and 
Peace had complete centro! 
over the film. 

The initial reaponse to the 
film was not in.pirinJ. It taad a 
loyal audience who liked it but 
mOlt of the critica hated it or 
didn't know how to deal with it. 
One critic who seemed to have 
the right attitude .ummed up 
the film by saying that when a 
film sets out to be bad, can you 
blame anyone if it .ucceeds? 

In the ca.e of Killer 
Tomatoes , all it n~ed waa a 
little time. " It took about a 
year for it to catch on," 
DeBello recalls, "It played the 
midnight circuit and found the 
right crowd who knew what to 
expect, and to just go and have 
fun . It became a kind of cult. " 

The film 's big boo.t came 
when it was shown as part oi a 
worst film festival and won the 

~rize for The Wor.t Vegetable 
Fam of All Time. DeBdlo, 
seeming to accept the award in 
the .ame spirit that it was 
given, says he likes this 
distinction. The film baa .ince 
played to overflow crowds in 
New York and has received 
national coverage on all three 
televi.ion network •. 

"People finally realized that 
it was meant to be fun. It was 
totally eliHerent and there was 
nothing like it, nothing for it to 
play with. They ran it with 
everything from The Blob to 
Oliver's Story. Airplane,

A peculiar thin h ned 
to the women'. v:ity~am 
last weekend at the La Verne 
Tournament. 

Somebody apparently 
forgot to tell the spikers that 
they were without their 
number one player, All· 
American Flaine Bergman, 
who quit the team last week. 
What the T ritOlll proceeded to 
do was to blowout Cal State

year'. nemesi. Biola, and edge 
pa.t tough University of 
Nevada at Las Vegas 
(UNLV) to reach the 
1fmifinaI. of a tournament in 
which UCSD had no right to 
penetrate the top eight, let 
alone .neak into the 
ICIII~. 

The team rebounded oH this 
tough lou and went on to 
defeat Pamona College 9·6. 
Thi. win placed the T ritonA in 
the semi·final. where they 
faced tournament favorite 

USC, A~8hUCSDp~yed 
well agaiant the T rojana they 
came up one point short and 
Ioat 10-9. 

Dmny Harper, coach 01 the 
TritOlll, was not unhapp)' with 
the team's play and fully 
expects them to improve as the 
playen become more 
experienced with game 
.ituations. 

UCSD'. next home game 
will be this Friday at 4 p.m. 
when they meet Pamona 
College a,ain in the

The weekend saw the 
Triton. fini.h fourth in the 
competition behind Loyola, 
Riverside, and a UNL V unit 
that came from behind UCSD 
to capture third place. 

"There's no wax I thought 
we'd do this wdl, ' rernarked 

I TheSo;:;;wn I 
coac h Doug Dannevik . 
Dannevik was .hocked by the 
team ' s maturity under 
prea.ure which he saw during 
the tournament. 

The .corea included a 15-2, 
15- 10 whitewashing of 
Baker.fiddand a 16.14,15-7 
drubbing of Biola. The team 
swept Welbnont 15-11, 15-
11 and aplit with Cal Poly 

, 

Pomona 10·15, 15·7. 
That gave UCSD a 7-1 

record and a playoff berth 
against UNLV, who went 
under 15·11, 15·13 and 
advanced the Tritons to the 
semifinals. 

The hard hitting spikers 
from Loyola won the 
tournament afte!' annihila ting 
UCSD 15.4, 15-2, but their 
defeat did not mar the overall 
success the Tritons enjoyed at 
La Verne. 

"We played tough. We had 
uemendous confidence. We 
showed character, " .aid 
Dannevik. "Many of our 
victories we!'e the come-from-

though, i. like it - the .ame 
10ft of genre." 

De.pite ita notoriety, 
De8elJo saYI, "I'm pretty 
proud of it. Sure there are 
momentl when I cringe, but 
even a filmmaker like Steven 
Spielberg baa those moment •. 
But it Wal my fint feature, and 
there are about 10 rlUnutea 
that I wouldn't mind lhowing 
to anyone." 

Like a proud parent, 
DeBello offer. to Ihow a 
caasette containin, .ome of 
those minutea. Included il one 
leene of a reali.tic look ins 
helicopter crash. 

One realon for that 
credibility i. that the 
helicopter , which worked 
perfectly in rehearsal., 
actuaJIy did crash. DeBello, 
u.in, the inventivenesl and 
quicknea. vital to independent 
filmmakers, improviled a 
scene about killer tomatoea 
attackin, in the air and was 
able to use the footage in the 
film. Fortunately, no one was 
hurt in the accident. 

The helicopter footage 
reminded DeBello of another 
accident that occurred durint 
the production. "We were 
shooting at Rohr one day 
when a suy driving a crane 
truck got involved watching 
U', and drove right through a 
power line. It put the plant into 
a blackout for the entire 
afternoon. We didn't get that 

on film but it would've been 
great. We would have worked 
it in .omehow." 

DeBello, who hal not seen 
Killer Tomatoea for more than 
two yean ("I can .tiD read the 
linea backwards") p1anl to be 
at the Ken Icreening along 
with other members of the ca.t 
and crew. 

The Cars 
Exhausted 
continued Irom page 5 

You certainly wouldn't have 
milled anything on .tage. The 
Cars are definitely this year'. 
model. They're 10 cool that 
they don't show any emotion 
or energy. Any indication that 
the music mean. anything to 
them i. milling. 

About the only good thins 
to watch was lead .inger Ric 
Ocalek .linking around in 
.mooth, formal lizard·like 
movernentl. But even that got 
boring, especially in the middle 
of supposedly impaslioned 
Car. tunes. 

Seemins more like they 
were leaving for a break 
between .eta than the end of a 
concert, the Car. did nothing 
to buad the audience toward 
the end of the concert and left 
abruptly with " My Belt 
Friend'. Girl." They played 
two Ii.tles. encores later to a 
tolerant crowd and left San 
Diego for what will 
presumably be another year or 
two. 

The Sporta Arena remain. 
a lou.y place to watch a 
concert, a toaet of a hall with 
bad lOund reproduction and 
ugI-.r interiorl. 

The u.ual arena bouncerl 
were on hand. as intrusive and 
Itrong·armed CijI ever. Anyone 
standing to cheer was hUlhed 
by the scowling men in yellow 
shirta. Several timea, fans 
breaking through the "security 
Iy.tems" were chased and 
pounced upon by the.e men 
who a1waYI managed to ule 
the threat of force or force itlelf 
when courtesy would have 
accompli.hed the same thing. 

If the Carl come around 
again, buy whatever atbum 
they have ju.t releaaed. You'll 
lave money and the album will 
probably play longer than they 
will.
