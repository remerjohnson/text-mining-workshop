Propositions: do the 
people stand a chance? 

Who should profit the most from the right to vote 
for propo itions and laws? The people. Who does 
profit the most? The advertisers. 

What should be the deciding factor in a \'otecast for 
a propo ition? The i ue. What is the deciding factor? 
Money. 

Thi, is no news to the voters; we've lived with it 
"ince the ~ystem was invented. The only d fense we 
have i~ to ignore the propaganda. if this can be done. 
We can't even see the real issue through all the hype. 
This IS not what the electoral system was made for. 
It 's a cri me: a crime whose victim is our right to make 
the rlecision for ourseh·es. Big business and lobbyists 
inculcate our opinions for us. 

For example. the shopping bags at Ra lphs. which 
€'\ er~ one carrie~ home. an' all pI inted with "No on 
11." 

Or. the San Francisco Ba~ Bridge, a thoroughfair

deposit law in Michigan and 
would work as follows: a 5¢ 
refundable deposit would be 
required on all beer and soft 
drinks sold in bottle. and cans. 
Retail stores would receive a 
minimum of one·fifth of this 
deposit to cover the C(Jsts of

Wilson, concentrated only on 
one theme: Wilson favored 
cutting some Social Security 
benefits. 

Now, the reverse seems 
more accurate, especially after 
Vietnam, Watergate and other 
scandals that have erupted 
ince 1970. Even if we like and 

respect the pre ident. as most 
Americans do, we no longer 
tru t the language he speaks. 

The economy is the single 
greatest concern of most 
citizens, but iew if any accept 
the explanations offered by 
tho e who are suppo ed to 
know. Economic policy 
advisers. who were once 
always ready to come up with 
a trong· ounding analy is of 
what was wrong, have quietly 
gone back to the lect ure room . 
Their political science 
colleagues, who used to 
provide grand analy es of 
cri e abroad. also have 
disappeared . 

In effect. what politicians 
today tell us about the 
economy and foreign crises 
does not go beyond what 
everyone already painfully 
knows . The language of 
politics is disturbingly empty. 

There sti ll are plenty of 
Americans who do vote. of 
course, regardles of the 
erosion of our political 
language. If people depend 
upon government checks or 
other kinds of entitlements. 
they can size up candidates 
and mea ure them in terms of 
evident self·interest. If people 
feel strongly about some 
special "s ingle issue ." they 
can measure candida.tes and 
referenda the same way. 

Some 2.500 years ago. the 
Chinese philosopher Confu· 
cious argued that the first tep 
in pol i tical reform is 
"rectification of names." Put 
in modern terms, that mean 
creating a language which wi ll 
explain things. and which

governed to the governing. 

It is that step, perhaps, 
which mos t stands between 
American and their voting

pecifically. the head of AS 
head of programming IS 
concerned that the responsibil · 
ity the AS assumes at TC's by 
providing beer cannot be 
adequetely justified . ThIS 
responsibility includes the 
enforcement of the minimum 
drinking age and the 
prevention of the use of open 
bottled containers of alcohol 
on campus.

CSD groundskeeper and pest controller, David Piper, in hi" clement. Piper ha" filed a ' 1.5 
million suit againsl the University. 

The Programming Commis· 
sioner noted, "the AS sets the 
tone for getting was ted" at 
TG's, and "to say 'everyone 
digs TGs' is making a racist 
statement ," as very few blacks 
were present at the recenl

don't think it is our duly to bu) 
people's beer. . .! am not willing 
to break the law to ingratiate 
myself (to students)" 

'T he AS Council voted to 
suspend the rules to allow for a 
general discussion of Parker's 
report and motion . Many 
Counci l members expressed 
concern that such an action 
would elicit a negative student

No Beer At TGs! 
There is a mot ion on t he floor of t he A 11 CSf) this week 

that I feel is of major Importance to a great deal oi 
st udent s. ome members of our glorious A UC J) an' 
trying to elimmate beer from TGIFs (you still would be 
able to BYO). In anv case. 1 feel TGs are one of UCSD·" 
onlv traditions and somet hing that st udents can look 
for' ... ·ard to. 

Well. the AS is now trying to pia) mommy to all of you 
students and IS deciding what you can and can't do at a 
social occasion. I don't feel this i. right. It took a whole 
year to be able to ha\ e beer at these e\'ent s, why should we 
nO\\1 change somet hing that the students like. Our campu,", 
suffers a . it IS from a high attrition rate. much of which is 
attributable to a lack of ocial life on campus. The AS 
should enhance the non-exi tent social life here, not tearit 
down. 

It is time for you tudents to come and speak at thi s 
Wedne day's A meeting at 6:30 in the North Conference 
Room and tell Dave Parker that this bill i not in the 
tudents best interest and to start programming for the 

good of the campus. Please how up. Mozoboon.

luncheon 
continued from page 1 
progress. and as the Pres ident 
aid, there is more in s tore if 

we are only willing to stay the 
course." 

Clark stressed, as the first 
o bj ecti \'e of the Reaga n 
administration. that befor we 
move on lo international 
affair~. "W~,must dean upour 
ow n house. 

Clark noted that the second 
task to keeping peace is to 
"restore t he foundation of 
strength which underlines the 
concept of deterrents ." lie 
poin ted out that the Soviet 
Union has outspent the Uni t<.'() 
States militarily in t he last 
decade by over $200 billion. 
But Clark added that under 
Pr esi dent Reaga n , "t h e 
program of rebuilding is now 
launched, a nd if we can 
sustall1 it. there is every 
pro m i set hat e f f e c t i \' e 
deterrents wi ll endure and 
that peace can be preserved, 
not on ly in our own. but in 
future generations," 

"The next important goa l." 
said Clark, "is reciprocity and 
reslra int in United S tates· 
Sov iet relationi->," He stressed 
lhat we must work wit h the 

oviet Union on all inter· 
national problems. whil e al 
the same time, not stand idly 
by \\ hen "Soviet suppression 
and subver ·ion is obvious." 
Here he discussed the 
con troversy over Reagan's 
policy of econ omic sanctions 
against the Sov iet Union for 
th eir actio ns in Poland, 
Centra l America, and 
Afghanistan. He called these 
sanct ions. "What may \'er~ 
we ll be the greatest human 
rights effort since World War 
I I. " 

The next issue Clark dealt 
wi this arms control. He 
termed the pu blic': intense 
interest in limiting nuclear 
arsenals "a n eXlreme ly 
h ea lth y a nd we l come 
phenomenon." He sa id that, 
" We must do everYl hing we 
can to reduce the amount of 
nu c lear weapons." He 
mentioned proposals made by 
Reagan to the oviet l nion to 
draslically reduce arsenals, 
but he did stress accounta· 
bllity on both s ides, and the 
danger of a unilateral freele. 

Clark t hen stated tha t the 
fifth object ive of the Reagan 
administralion in foreign 
affairs is "to establish a new 
basis for conducting our 
relat IOns ",it h the de\'elopi ng 
countries of the world. 
which," he said. "re li es 
hea vily on t he energy of the 
private sector. The President 
has tried to blend a 
combination of trade, aid. and 
in centi ves for in veslmen t into 
a car fully balanced arrange· 
ment to facil it a te the self·help 
efforts of people in t he"e

Kripke and Rider debate 
at international center 
continue d (rom page 1 
we have turned over to the 
gO\'ernmenl. .. 

And he expressed his belIef 
that the 'ales tax ~hou ld be 
dropped and t he state income 
lax should be cut in half. 

Finally, a disagreement 
surfaced. Rider described the 
education sy tern as "failing" 
and he claimed that the best 
solul1on is input from outside 
sources. He feels the 
individual should be able to 
choose bel ween pu blic and 
private school,>, and t hat high 
chool st udents should be 

allowed to make their own 
choice as to whether or not to 
attend school. 

The commotion which that 
st atemen t crea ted in the 
audience continued as Rider 
talked about not imprisoning 
people guilty of \' ictimless 
crimes such as prostitution. 

The floor was t hen opened to 
question. and most were 
directed towards Rider's view 
on education, which led to a 
heated discussion concerning 
their differences on the issue 
bet ween Kripke and Rider. 
Kripke said that more 

government money should be 
spent on educat ion. while 
Rider felt that the public 
school system is inadequate. 

Kripke stated. "We need 
more chscipline, longer school 
hours, computers and video 
recorders 111 everv classroom. 
And we need money." Rider 
disagreed and felt t he key is 
"to get educat ion away from 
the government." 

When t he quest ions ceased. 
both candidates reminded the 
audience that O\'ember 2, is 
the day "to exercise your right 
to vote."

Rhonda Becker heard The 
Crowd on her way to work L haL

thaI unusual . she had heard 
Lh silent echoes of I heir

'itru.:k such a deep chord on 
this bleary Monday. 

Wrestling her big Chel'} 
through the morning rush

Running Thoughts TRITON SPORTS SHORTS 
FENClNG-By MIKE GRE E-NBERG a nd JEFF SAVAGE Sta rr Wri ter. 

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. In the past few weeks 
we have been criticizing the Admi nistrat ion's lack of su pport for 
Intercollegiate Athletics here at UCSD . We have expressed that 
there is no t::ommitment w hatsoever on their part toa successful 
program. We are not alone in our belief. On KSDT's in terview 
program "Coaches Corner," UCSD men 's and women's 
voll eyba ll Coach Doug Dan nevik voiced his opinion on the issue. 
" I haven't een support from the Admi nistration for not only the 
volleyba ll program but the entire program in general. I haven't 
seen that they even rare." You hit the nail right on the head, 
Doug. We wonder just how long the Administration t h inh the 
program can survive on the skimpy budget that they provide. 

Cal State Long Beach proved to be too tough for the Triton fencing teams. The men 's 
{oil, led by Andy Leask, won the only competition for UCSD, who lost in men 's epee. 
men's sabre, and women's foil, all by lopsided margins. The men are now 2· 1; the women 
are 0-3. 

MEN'S WATER POLO -
Friday UCSD lost to #2 UC Berkeley at the Miramar pool, 10-6. The loss makes the 

Triton record 9-11 ·1, where it will hold until next Saturday's home match wit h Long 
Beach State. 

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBAlL -

NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. The San Diego media. 
Whi le at the San Diego Clipper home opener against t he Phoenix 
Suns, we were amazed at the behavior of t he San Diego press. 
Wh ile the Phoenix press was simply doing their job, San Diego's 
finest repeatedly cheered their team on. This is BUSH. The. e 
guys are supposed to report in an unbiased fa hion and in a 
professional manner. Instead they acted like high school 
rh erleaders, shouting a big HOORRAY for every Clipper good 
deed . Not only does it look like we have to tolerate the NBA's 
worst team, but we have to pu t up with a second rate press too. 

Last Saturday's match resulted in a four game loss to Cal State Northridge, t hesoon·to-
be In ranked team in Division II. The scores were 3·15, 15·9, 16·14, and 15·2. UCSD's 
I'fJCOI'd is IlOW 1~9. Their next match is Friday night at USF. 

Preview of swim season 
WA IT A MIN UTE DEPT. In la t Thursday' Guardian 
(Letters to the Editor section), Registration Fee Committee 
Chairperson Gerrie Hatten corrected us on an error in the 
October 21 · t edition of Running Thoughts - and rightfully so. 
But instead of allowing the correction to stand on its own merits, 
MISS Halton did herself in by going overboard. Unfortunately 
her bias wa' a bit obvious as she left out some revealing fat s. The 
newly appointed chairperon stated, "The $3 .000 Intercollegiate 
At hlet ics received last year (for coaches) is part of their 
permanent budget. It is a set amount they receive every year ... 
In other words, Intercolle,giate Athletic is not receiving any less 
than they have had in the past. " Goodgrie/Miss Hatton , we hope 
not. If the coaches received any less t han they do now. they 
would have to open up J communit~, lemonade stand just to pay 
the bilb. Here are the facts: the a\'erage sa lary among the 22 
coaches here at lJCSD is. 1,900 a vear. c\1iss Hatton earns $2.000 
a year for her t hree·hour·pcr·week meet Ings on t he Reg. Fee). She 
goes on to say. "Would you be interested in -;eeing another 
S98.00()·SI06.()OO go toward paying Intercollegiate coaches. or do 
you :-.ce ot her areas of st udent service wh ich have higher student 
priorit ies'" FIN of all. she says "anot her" $98.000·$ 16.000. 
I III plying that t hey already receive t hat figure. Where is il? We 
can't find it! Second, and more imlxlrt ant. even if they did recel\'e 
t he full increase. bringing t he budget salary total to $144 .noo. the 
('(laches would earn an average yearly salary of on ly $6.:1()u. The 
a\wage sa lary for coache"- at all ot her lIC campuse"- is $] 7.000 a 
year. Those are the FACTS . Somehow these figure:-. must have 
slipped Mis ... lIat ton's mind.

These excellent times by 

Triton swimmers in t heir first 
meet have t~e twenty·eight 
year old mentor gleaming with 
optimism for the rest of the 
season. " We are a vastly 
improved team from las t year. 
Considering this is our first 
meet, our swimmers are dOIng 
quite well. The returning 
'swimmer are sWImmIng 
mu ch better than in the past 
because they have a chance at 
doing quite well in the 
Nationals; this tends to 
motivate them." 

This team, Morgan :-.ay". I~ 
filled with talent. "On top of 
the ret urnees that \\ ent to 
Nationals last year. we havE' 
seven freshmen on the Illen \ 
team and ten on the women 's 
team that have done natIonal 
qualifying times in high 
school." 

The team has s('\'cn 
returning ..,wimmers \\ ho 
competed in the Nationals last 
year. including Pete Ackhoff. 
Greg Barry. Bob Conlin. Greg 
))oyas. Dave Higdon. Joh n

expects to do well this ~ ear arc 
Peppo Biscarini, Hutch 
Cramer , Ben Geise. Todd 
"Animal" Jacobsen , Dale 
Lagcrgr n. Doug Smith. Bob 
Stockwell, Eric Vitcenta, and 
Scott Velrado. 

The women 's team I .. 
extremely strong. led by Lee 
Morrow. who set t hc ;\ICAA 
DiviSIOn I I I record In the 200· 

meter butterfly last year. 
Other top returners are DIana 
Charle~. Barbara Lee, and 
DeDe Steinhoff. The squad 

boast~ a P<Jwerfu I lineup of 
freshman glrb m MIchelle 
Brafman . Allison Gilmore, 
Tanya Jones. and Irene Mons. 

This is the first time lIeSD 
has had this many top not ch 
swimmers. "We ha\ e ne\er 
had this amount of quality 
national sWImmers." says 
Morgan . "Before It ha.., beer. 
more a proces:-. of de\elopmg

though. no luck. Now terling 
ha a lawsuit on his hand • 
filed by an ex-SDSU ba ketball 
player who won a free·throw 
hooting conte t ponsored by 

Sterling. but never received 
the $1,000 prize. There have 
been talks with a La Jolla 
cardiologi t about selling the 
team, but nothing seem to be 
materializing. If the sale can 
be commenced before Sterling 
can initiate his "go·for·O" 

trategy. then thing should 
definitely tart looking up on 
the basketball court. 

Now with a couple of 
established guards in Hollins 
and Smith to go with an 
excellent front line of AI Wood . 

Chambers, and a once·a·week 
Walton . the Clipper could 
pull them elve out of the 
cellar of the Pacific Divi ion. 

Here 's a look at the rest of 
the Division. The La Angeles 
Lakers are the class of the 
Pacific if not all of basketball. 
With the addition of James 
Worthy to the likes of Magic 
Johnson and Kareem Abdul 
Jabbar, the World Champions 
could fie ld two teams that 
could beat just about anylxxly. 

The Seattle Supersonics 
pose the biggest threat to the 
Lakers. With new acquisition 
David Thomp on pairing up 
with Gus Williams. the Sonies 
could quite literally be flying 
high. 

T he UC D Guardian 

Then come the Suns. Lucas 
could be just what the doctor 
ordered here. Lucas will help 
to hed t he Suns' nice-guy 
image with muscle where they 
need it . under the board . Now 
that the "greyhound." Walter 
Davis. is back from an elbow 
injury. the Suns have a 
formida ble backcourt in Davis 
and Dennis Johnson_ 

If there is a sleeper in the 
Pacific, it is the Golden State 
Warriors. If they can get good 
play out of their forwards. 
they could wind up in the 
playoffs. A n off-season trade 
for Michael Ray Richardson. 
who led the New York Knicks 
in scoring and a sists. give 
the Warriors t woof the bigge t 
scoring guards in the league in 
Rich ardson and former 
Clipper World B. Free. Top 
draftee Lesl er Conner will 

help bolster 'a leaky defense. 
Finally t here is the Port land 

Trail Blazers, an all around 
average team. They will have 
to improve their inside scoring 
and defense if t hey have any 
a 'pirations of a successful 
sea on. A trade of guard 
Kel vin Ramsey for center 
Wayne Cooper should help. 
JIm Paxson i a definite big 

coring threat. and with 
Darnell Valentine in charge of 
the offense. the Trail Blazers 
will be doing a lot of running. 

Alee it the tanding. 
should end up like this: 

1) Los Angeles 
2) Seattle 
3) Phoellix 
4) Coldell Sto/e 
5) San Diego 
6) Portland
