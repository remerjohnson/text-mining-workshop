UCSD Study Leads Du Pont 
To Phase out N20 Emissions 
By Stephanie Simon 
Staff Writer 

As a result of the research pub-
lished recently by two UCSD profes-
sors, the Du Pont corporation has 
vowed to halt its nitrous oxide (NP) 
emission by 1996. 

The research, co-authored by pro-
fessors William Trogler and Mark 
Thiemens, dealt with their discovery 
that the depletion of the atmosphere, 
as well as the "Greenhouse Effect," 
are being hastened by N20 emissions 
from the manufacture of nylon. The 
article was published in the Feb. 22 
issue of the journal Science. 

According to Gregory Hollod, 
environmental manager of Du Pont, 
the manufacturers plan to "recycle 
the Np and beneficially use the ni-

Court Ruling Puts Kink 
In UCSD Class Readings 
• Professors scramble as Kinko's 
reading packets are temporarily stalled 
By Eric Schmidt 
Staff Writer 

UC D students may re e ive 
some cour e reading material late 
this quarter as a re ult of a recent 
federal court ruling against Kinko' 
Graphics Corporation. 

On March 28, a U.S. District 
Court lapped the national chain of 
copy center with an injunction 
halting further printing of course 
packet without permi ion from 
publishers. 

Judge Con tance Baker Motley 
ruled that all packet from copy-
righted materials cannot be repro-
duced under the "Fair U e" clau e 
of the 1976 Copyright Act, accord-
ing to a pre s relea e is ued by 
Kinko' . 

The FairUseclause a1lowscopies 
to be made with ut the publ isher' 
permi sion under certai n restric-
tions. By FairUseguidelines, books 
copied without permission must be 
for non-profit purpo es, must not 
eriously alter the price of the b k, 

and mu t be a certain length in re-
lation to the whole book. 

Judge Motley decided that the 
Kinko 's policy accounts for a large 
portion of the company' profits, 
but also cuts profits that should go to 
the publ i her. 

"Thi i a ad day for the educa-
tional commun ity," said Kurt 
Koenig. the vice president and legal 
counselofKi nko' . "Profes ors and 
students who depend on this timely 
material will suffer as a result ofth is 
court decision." 

According to Adrianna Foss of 
the Kinko' s Corporation, all Kinko 's 
stores previously asked for the 
publisher' permission if they fe lt 
the materials did not fal l wi thin the 
Fair Use provision. 

In the future, she said, Kinko ' 
will obtain permission for all re-
produced materials. 

Meanwhile, the ruling i hitting 
Kinko's stores located near quarter-
system universities hard. Foss said 
that, of the 540 Kinko 's stores na-

tionwide, about 40 serve quarter-
ystem universitie su h as UCSD. 

ince the ruling was made la t 
Thursday, those 40 tores have not 
had time to comply wi th the law. As 
are ult, the relea eof tho e Kinko's 
course packets wi ll be delayed. 

"What was legal on Thursday is 
no longer legal ," Foss said. 

"Kinko's [offices] near quarter 
school are really impacted," she 
added. "They' re working around 
the clock [to get publishers' permis-
sion]." 

Many UCSD professors who had 
planned to use Kinko 's for their 
clas readers thi quarter are cur-
rently switching to other copying 
ervices whi le Kinko" get ' back on 

tra k. 
Profe sor Alden Mosshammer, 

whose Humani ties :2 c1ru.s was im-
pa tedbylheruling,saldheswitched 
to al Copy for a speedier process. 

According to Mos~hammer, 
"The ·tlldenlS suffer" from the im-
plication'> of the lUling, ,ince CO!>l 
of c pied b k excerpts may rise or 
become unavailable. 

al Copy, based in La Jolla, has 
reported an increase in bu!>ine~s as a 
res ult of the injunction. Reza 
Mansoon, general manager of Cal 
Copy, aid the tore i not affected 
by the ruling, which. he said, affects 
only Kinko 's. 

Cal Copy does not need permis-
sion to make copies under the 1976 
Copyright Act, according to Mon-
soon. 

"We usual ly go by the Fair Use 
clause," he said. 

However, another press release 
from Kinko's reported that "The 
court deci ion limits the ability of 
all establishments, not just Kinko's, 
to provide course material ." 

The UCSD Soft Reserves Service 
has also seen a slight increase in

COMMENTARY 

Getting Caught With Our Pants Down 
• Impending national interest dictates need for oil alternatives 
By Ben Boychuk 
Opinion Editor 

Oil, like money, seems to make the 
world go 'rounl Consider the recent 
Persian Gulf War. When Saddarn 
Hussein began massing his .troops along 
the Iraq-Kuwait border last summer, it 
appeared to be an intimidation tactic to 
force the Kuwaiti government to comply 
with OPEC oil production quotas. 

When the Iraqi army finally invaded 
on August 2, 1990, it was apparent that 
Hussein had no qualms about using such 
force. Of course, it became apparent 
later on that Hussein just wanted 
Kuwait's oil fields (despite its rather 
small size, Kuwait has some of the 
richest oil deposits in the world), and a 
convenient sea port. 

While oil was certainly not the only 
factor that led to war, no one can deny 
that it played a central role. President 
Bush said that one of the goals of the 
U.S. presence in the region was to 
protect "our way of life." Oil is an 
inseparable part of every American's 
daily life. Oil and petroleum-based 
products are everywhere. 

So, when Iraq invaded Kuwait Last 
August, America was caught with its 
pants down. Wall Street panicked, the 
oil industry panicked, and the consumers 
panicked - and gOl screwed at the 
pump for their troubles. Gas prices 
soared ridiculously, and there was some 
speculation that the oil conglomerates 
were taking advantage of the volatile 
situation by gouging consumers. 

The oil industry's excuse was that the 
Persian Gulf crisis had driven up the 
demand for oil, and with the economic 
sanctions and trade embargo against 
Iraq, they were hard pressed to meet that 
demand. This excuse was effective for a 
shon time, until the public was made 
aware that Iraq and Kuwait produced a 
very small percentage of America's oil. 
Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing 
Arab states were able to make up for the 
Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil deficit with little effort 
at all. 

Had the war dragged on for months, 
or years, the industry may have had a 
case. It is conceivable that a long-term 
conflict may have eventually caused an 

. oil shortage. But the war was short. And 
now that it is over, Americans need to 
seriously consider looking for alterna-
tives to oil . This task, however, will be 
extremely difficult. 

The U.S. has weathered three major 
oil crises in the last two decades, and has 
emerged no worse for wear, or so it 
appears. Millions of Americans weath-
ered the "gas crunches" of the 1970s. 
Many people still have vivid memories 
of waiting in their cars for two, three, or 
four hours for a few gallons of gasoline, 
oftentimes only to be disappointed -
and angered - when the station 
attendant announced that there was no 
more gas. 

But the crisis passed, and people 
became complacent. Aggressive plans to 
research and develop gasoline alterna-
tives such as methanol and ethanol were 
put on the back burner. Simply put, once 
the oil tap was turned back on, many 
people saw no need to spend millions of 
dollars and countless hours researching 
what would essentially be a less efficient 
alternative. 

With the third and most recent crisis 
past, Americans again risk falling prey 
to a false sense of security. We may 
have won the Persian Gulf War, but the 
long-term impact is yet to be seen. Right 

now, consumers only see that gas prices 
have fallen back to their pre-invasion 
levels, and they are content. 

But who is to say that America's oil 
interests in the Middle East won' t be 
jeopardized again in the future, as they 
were in the '70s, and last year? With the 
Texas oil industry in ruins, America's oil 
intere ts are the mo t vuLnerable they 
have been in years. 

Common sense dictates that the U.S. 
cannot afford to rely on Middle Eastern 
countries with nebulous intentions for 
our much-needed oil fIX. Therefore, the 
search for viable oil alternatives is no 
longer an issue to be discussed in the 
future tense, but a matter of impending 
national interest. 

In the past, the government has 
pushed through many necessary pro-
grams under the auspices of our "na-
tional defense." The California freeway 
system was one such program. While 
recognizing the need for an easier and 
faster means of public transportation -
especially in southern California, where 
the population and number of automo-
biles grew exponentially - the Califor-
nia freeway package was presented as a 
portion of a civil defen e bill. The logic 
was that the freeways would facilitate 
the quick and easy transport of troops 
and weapons - like missiles. 

The research and development of 
energy alternatives hould be presented 
in a similar fashion. Congress should 
pass legislation funding federal research 
facilities and provide incentives to 
private industry, or perhaps universities, 
to research and develop co t-efficient 
alternative fuels over the next 10 years. 

The govemment should also feel free 
to provide incentives and perhaps a tax-
break to existing oil firms to develop 
such an alternative. After all, if the oil 
industry really does have the U.S. 
Congress in its pocket, the Congress 
should at least cut the industry in on the 
deal. 

A more realistic assessment, however, 
See ADDICTION, page 6 

OIL: 'Real cost' of U.S. fuel hidden by subsidies 
Continued from page 4 
to get. He added that this sends a 
message to consumers that it's okay to 
waste energy. 

"By subsiding oil prices it causes us to 
over-consume and over-pollute," Heede 
said. "It makes us less sensitive to the fact 
that we need to use less energy." 

Subsidies also hide the true costs of 
oil. While the average cost of a barrel of 
bil ranges from $20 to $30, Heede said 
this total doesn't include all of the 
expenses related to oil consumption. 

The "IQJ" cost of oil, according to 
Heede, would exceed $100 a barrel when 
societal expenses are factored into the 
price. Pollution from excess driving, 
envirorunental damage from the produc-
tion and disposal of plastics, ecological 
disasters like the Exxon Valdez oil spill, 
and the cost of the war in the Persian 
Gulf should all contribute to price of oil. 

"We ought to have energy prices that 
tell the truth," Heede said. ''Why should a 
taxpayer from Kansas pay for extra oil 
consumption in L.A. 'l" 

As oil comumpIion keeps going up, 
Heede said thal conswners cannot 
continue to consume oil at the current 
rate indefinitely. 

"Sane people conserve energy 
beauIe it makes then'l feel good, but by 
and large, most people will have to pay 

" We ought to have energy prices 
that tell the truth. Why should a 

taxpayer from Kansas pay for extra 
oil consumption in L.A.? 

" RICHARD HEEDE 
Rocky Mountain Institute 

more to use less." 
Heede said that it is "very ingrained" 

within the American culture to waste 
energy, and that it would be hard get 
people to change their habits willingly. 
A tripling or quadrupling of current gas 
prices would send an appropriate 
message to consumers to conserve. 

"We would like to give people 
incentives to save oil," Heede said. 

RMI also proposes using "feebates," 
a system that rewards or punishes 
drivers depending on the fuel efficiency 
of their cars. Consumers who buy cars 
with high fuel effICiency receive rebates; 
those who buy low efficiency cars 
would pay a fee. 

Heede said this would encourage 
consumers to demand highly efficient 
cars, which in turn would pressure car 
makers IDQUIe them. 

According to the RMI, increasing the 
19-miles-per-gallon average of all 
American cars by three miles would save 
about 730,000 barrels of oil a day, 
equivalent to all of the fuel that was 
imported from Iraq and Kuwait.lncreas-
ing the miles-per-gallon average by nine 
miles saves approximately two million 
barrels a day - an amount matching all 
of the oil imported from the Middle East. 

Heede noted that auto makers 
currently have built and tested various 
vehicle prototypes that average from 67 
to 138 miles-per gallon. However, there 
is no incentive for the car makers to 
bring these cars to the marketplace. 

Heede estimated that the U.S. could 
curtail oil consumption by up to 75 
percent with increased fuel efficiency 
techniques. The key is informing the 
public of more efficient ways to use oil. 

"It is terrible to waste oil when there 
are more efficient ways to use it," Heede 
said. "It's a crying shame for future 
generations that this generation sits in its 
hands." 

The time to act, of course, is now. 
Energy experts predict that the oil 
supply, under current consumption, will 
run dry within 30 to 90 years. If Ameri-
can oil addicts don't find ways to cut 
back drastically, they'll find themselves 
going cold turkey.

ADDICTION 
Continued from page 5 
is the fact that Congress needs 10 
be concerned with the potential 
impact that a shift from oil to non-
petroleum alternatives will have 
on the nation's employment. Ana-
lysts have predicted that at the rate 
the world is consuming oil, the 
earth could be tapped out within 30 
or40years.Bydevelopingefficient 
petroleumaltemativesnow, we can 
save oursel ves the painful transition 
later, and provide much-needed 
jobs. 

And it need not necessarily 
come at the expense of the oil 
industry. If corporations like Exxon 
and Atlantic-Richfield want to 
malce money, it should be made 
clear that it is in their best interests 
to get into the oil-alternatives busi-
ness now, or find themselves out of 
business later. 

Oil is America's heroin. We 
can't live withoUl our plastic cups, 
our synthetic fabrics, and all of the 
little things around us that would 
not exist were it not for petroleum. 
But most of all, we love our cars, 
and we ' ll be damned if we have to 
give them up. But that time may 
come, especially if we don't start 
looking for viable alternatives with 
which to manufacture those prod-
ucts which we now take for granted. 
What we need is a sort of Metha-
done - an alternative drug to oil 
that will be just as good. 

We will always be addicted to 
oil. Given the right push, science 
can find a way to make that addic-
tion easier to deal with when the 
drug eventually runs out. If no" the 
withdrawal symptoms will be bru-
tal.

music by a Balboa Park 
street performer 
Story by Naveed Merchant, Staff Writer 
Photographs by Gall Johnson. Staff Photographer 

R ick Knowlton wakes up early on Saturday morning and decides to go to work, by playing in the park. Most San Diegans are still drowsily contemplat-ing their day off. With the utmost care. 
he pulls the trailer he built last summer 

over to his car and hitches it Then he rolls out his 
piano - mounted on a home-made cart - pushes it 
up the ramp that closes into a door on the flatbed 
trailer, and is off to Balboa Park. The mono painted 
on the side of Knowlton's trailer blurs as he leaves: 
"Have piano, will travellUlI.. .. " 

Once at the park, Knowlton rolls out his piano and 
waits in line with a spectrum of clowns. portrait 
artists, musicians, magicians, and other street per-

fonners who will be in the park that day. As he waits 
in line with this mixed bag of performers, Knowlton 
recalls the street artists in the carnival he left behind 
three months ago at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, 
Colorado. 

They have different names and different faces, but 
somehow they are the same ones he's seen through-
out his travels westward from New Jersey to Minne~ 
sota, Key West to Vegas, San Francisco to Boulder, 
and now to Balboa Park. 

"It's a very loose-knit culture, a society of 
individuals doing their own thing," Knowlton said. 

He begins to wonder why most of the clowns are 
women, and then quickly abandons this, knowing 
better than to generalize about this varied society. 
With the fonnalities and paperwork out of the way, 
he finally sits down to play his piano. He is seated a 
respectful distance from the harpist, who is just out of 
earshot. He loves the music of the harp, but he obeys 
the unwritten code of ethics for the street performer: 
Musicians, especially. must be careful not to over-
whelm eachothers ' acts. 

Street performer Rick 
Knowlton plays his 
piano on wheels In 
Balboa Park, making 
his living on the tips he 
receives from the 
people that listen to his 
performances.

PIANO 
ContInued from page SI 

Alone now, he plays his piano, 
his orchestra. He calls it his or-
chestra because of the incredible 
range of sound it has. Beginning 
the day with the theme to Dr. 
Zhivago, he fills the area around 
him with a sweeping melody. And 
he begins to fall in love with his 
piano again, reli hing the respon-
siveness, the feedback of his in-
strument. 

"The fact that the way [touched 
the piano would affect the sound 
quality gave me the motivation [0 
sit in front of the piano for hours 
and learn how to do it," Knowlton 
explained. 

He plays with the active belief 
that the machine was specifically 
built to respond to his varying 
touch, that different ranges and 
textures of sound bring the machine 
to life. He hits it hard and it answers 
with an equally furious sound. It 
seemingly reflects, even translates 
his emotions. 

He also feels it pulling him back 
to his past. How long has he been 
playing? Since the age of 16 -
half a lifetime ago. 

He remembers all of the crazy 
artistic stuff his father, a computer 
grdphics artist, encouraged him to 
do, like singing foUe songs while

tar. Knowlton remembers hating 
the piano lessons his parents paid 
for when he was six, and giving it 
up altogether until he was 16, when 
he returned to the household piano 
and, for the first time, was dazzled 
by its responsiveness. He remem-
bers sitting in front of the piano for 
hours and hours playing, learning 
how to do it on his own .... 

Another dollar drops into his 
tip jar. He smiles without disrupt-
ing his piece, loving the tip as 
much as the responsiveness of his 
piano. He sees everything that 
drops into his jar, from a penny to 
a $50 bilJ, as more than bread and 
buner - it's personal gratifica-
tion . 

He plays on, now an Elton 10hn

them with sound. nus isn't like 
the first time he played in public, 
when he was nervously wonder-

ing, "What do they think of me? 
Do (look like a jerk?" . 

Now, he takes confidence for 
granted, knowing that he doesn't 
have to present himself, only his 
music. 

There is a comradery among 
street perfonners, drawn panly 
from a loathing of regular jobs and 
mostly on a valued independence. 
Knowlton hits the keys knowing 
that he's working for himself, and 
he finds it comforting. It's a clean 
profession: People know what he 
is doing, there is no middle man, 
no confusing bureaucracy or 
complications. 

He looks into his tips jar and 
sees the offers to play at weddings 
and parties. He also comes across 
an offer to play at the Comedy 
Store in La 1011a. He'll get back to 
these offers. For now, Knowlton 
belongs to the sunshine, his piano,

. "I'm sorry, Mr. Gray won't be able to arrange 
an interview. He's shooting a pilot series in 
Santa Fe in-between appearances for 'Monster in 
a Box. '" How ironic. This couldn't possibly be 
what Spalding Gray has referred to as horizontal 
fame - "kind of like chunky peanut butter 
spread on hot toast" - in which one is only 
slightly recognizable. This is defmitely vertical 

fame - "the champaign cork-popping kind." 
Spalding Gray has spent his career avoiding 

this vertical fame, which would prevent him from 
doing what he does best: observing others 
unobtrusively. Now he has to contend with others 
observing him observing others. It all gets too 
complicated and defeats the purpose of his craft. 
Many people reading these words may be think-

that busyness for naught. However, Page H2

GRAY 
Continued from H1 
one will find out during Spalding 
Gray's performance of "Monster 
in a Box" this Friday, he keeps 
bu y in order to avoid fini hing his 
autobiography. 

A circuitous as it sounds - a 
man who became lightly famous 
by avoiding fame now masters 
procrastination by centering a 
monologue on not being able to 
fini sh an autobiography which he 
mayor may not be able to sell. 
Believe it or not, it makes sense 
coming from Spalding Gray. 

Gray has been called a monolo-
gist, a performance artist, a practi-
tioner of post-modem theater. 
However, no label is more appro-
priate than storyteller. Whatever 
the main subject is, Spalding Gray 
is able to go off on a tangent, and 
an eternity later weave the anec-
dote back into the monologue 
without a visible seam . . 

Even i fthe words "perfonnance 
artist" or"post-~" scare you, 
don't run away from this man. He 
is wildly funny, only mildly para-
noid, and he swears that every-
thing h~ tells you is the truth. 

One can expect all notions of 
theater to be challenged by Gray. 
The sole character is Spalding Gray 
and his stage is occupied only by a 
card table, a chair, a glass of water, 
a notebook, and a large cardboard 
box with a monster in it. 

The dialogue, which could be 
fact or fiction, is deli vered straight 
totheaudienceinan intimaleman-
ner that belies the thealrical set-
ting. 

Monologues such as "Sex and 
Death to the Age 14" and "Booze, 
Cars, and College Girls" chronicle 
Gray's c hildhood and adolescent 
experiences in Rhode Island and 
Boston. His strong presence on 
stage and his captivating narrative 
won him a cult following among 
avant-garde theater-goers. 

He is perhaps most famous for 
"Swimming to Cambodia," a 
monologue which won an OBIE 
and was made into a movie by 
Jonathan Demme ("Silence of the 
Lambs"). 

In "Swimming to Cambodia," 
Gray relates his experiences as an 
actor with a bit-part on the set of 
"The KiU ing Fields," searching for 

the Perfect Moment. Amid Gray's 
storie related to the movie, pieces 
of c urrent history fly by with 
seemingly unrelated incidents. All 
the while, everything comes back 
together with characteristic re-
frain , such as " meanwhile, that 
sexy sax-playing Prince 
Sihanouk.. ." Back to the story, 
back to the story. 

Spalding Gray's fame could be 
a curse. Outside of the avant-garde 
circles of New York theater, he is 
a relative unknown. His mono-
logues should become more pres-

" He is the Kerouac of 
the baby boomers, 
animated and full of 
life, ready to tell his 
story not only with 

his voice 
but with his body. 

" tigious in an industry and culture 
currently obsessed with confes-
sions, with which Gray heavily 
spices his wort, One would think 
that in an age when a dog can have 
a book on the bestseller list, 
Spalding Gray should have some 
recognition. 

The stage, which Gray uses as a 
confessional, takes on the setting 
of what could be a "talking cure" 
prescribed by an analyst. By let-
ting everyone in on his darkest 
phobias and traumatic experiences, 
he can let them go and walk away 
clean. However, Gray's seemingly 
endless sources of discourse lend 
no credence to any cure whatso-
ever, 

Apparently, that is just fine with 
Spalding Gray, since the stories he 
tells eventually drift further away 
from fact. In the introduction to his 
published text of "Swimming to 
Cambodia," Gray quotes Jorge 
Luis Borges: "Every time I recall 
something, I'm not recalling it re-
ally, I'm recalling the last time I 
recalled it. I'm recalling my last 
memory of it." . 

Gray states in his own words 
that "a finished product is a result 
of a series of organic creative mis-
takes - perception itself becom-

ing the editor of the final repon." 
Hecall himself a "poetic reponer," 
an impressionist painter ratherthan 
a photographer. 

" Monster in a Box" is Gray's 
latest piece of reportage. It is a 
study in procrastination. Charac-
terized by Gray as "a monologue 
about a man who can ' t write a 
book about a man who can't take a 
vacation," the piece chronicles his 
attempts to both write and not write 
his autobiography for Knopf pub-
lishers. . 

The 1.500 page manuscript is 
the "monster" in the cardboard box 
on stage, and the procrastination 
stems panly from what has been 
understood as mildly Oedipal 
feelings fora mother who commit-
ted suicide in 1967, and partly from 
a belief that "I can write in the 
morning." 

With that as the base of his 
monologue, Spalding Gray takes 
the audience to Nicaragua on a 
fact-finding mission, to a New 
Hampshire writer's colony, to the 
Hennitage in Russia. and to sunny 
Southern California reponing on 
himself and the people he encoun-
ters. 

He is the Kerouac of the baby 
boomers, animated and full of life, 
ready to tell his story oot only with 
his voice but with his body. His 
anns and hands express the anger 
and humor reflected in his eyes. 
The audience will be witness to the 
world's only paranoid sit-down 
comic. 

What you will fmd with "A 
Personal History of the American 
Theatre" and "Monster in a Box" 
is a man in love with his work. who 
would otherwise ~ither away 
without an audience. 

It has been feared that Spalding 
Gray's forays into film with parts 
in "Swimming to Cambodia," 
"Beaches" and "True Stories" 
would distract and dull his wit. On 
the contrary, his ventures into film 
have only provided him with more 
material to amuse himself and his 
audience. And also an excuse not 
to finish his book.

Borderline Taste? 
• Madonna may be able to justify her love. 
But is there any way to justify her sexism? 
By Lara Heisler 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

I wish I could say that the majority of 
women in the music industry are helpful to 
feminism. I wish I could say that the women 
who have the ability to reach thousands of 
young men and women through their words 
and music write in a manner that is empow-
ering to themselves and all women. 1 wish 1 
could say that the famous women who we 
see on MTV have taken control - refusing 
to allow their bodies to be exploited and 
objectified for the sake of a buck. 

But aU 1 can say is that the majority of the 
highest-grossing, most powerful, and most 
- dare 1 say it - respected women in the 
music industry have used their clout to per-
petuate all of the damaging stereotypes and 
gender roles-that are clinged to by our male-
dominated society. And that really scares 
me, 

What ar~ you gonna do? 
Talk to m~ - tell me your dreams 
Am I in them? 
One night, as 1 sat in my bedroom, I heard 

the soft drone of music coming from the 
television. Over the hum of some pop video, 
1 listened to my ten-year-old brother and his 
friend talk as they played with their Leggos 
in front of the TV. My brother was saying, "I 
can't wait to grow up." His friend agreed, 
predicting, "Yeah, we could stay up as late 
as we want to and watch as much TV as we 
want to." I smiled to myself, remembering 

my own ten-year-old desire to be a grown-
up. My brother continued the conversation: 
"When I grow up, I'm gonna get a girl-
friend. " 

I crept down the hall, and peeked in to the 
room so I could better spy. Looking in on 
them, hoping naively for some sort of 
Norman Rockwell scene of male bonding, I 
was struck by the image on the television 
before me. Madonna, wearing a leather 
teddy, lay sprawled across a bed with a thick 
metal chain around her neck. She sang to 
me, "Don ' t go for second best, baby, put 
your love to the test. Express yourself." My 
brother's friend had abandoned his Leggos, 
and stared at Madonna's 'expressive' breasts. 
"I want my girlfriend to be just like her," he 
said. 

I just wanna be your lover 
I wanna be your baby 
On ABC's "Nightline," Madonna spoke 

about the service she is doing for women by 
encouraging them to "express themselves. ,. 
She claimed that, "No man is telling me 
what to do. No man is pushing me around. If 
1 appear in a viqeo chained to a bed, no man 
chained me to that bed. I chained myself to 
the bed." I wonder how many ten-year-old 
boys - or for that matter, how many men of 
any age - would realize that Madonna was 
shackled on her own volition. 

She assures viewers that her latest song, 
"Justify My Love," is about a woman who is 
sexually free, and who rises above the pa-

triarchal constraints 
of society to enjoy her 
own brand of sexual-
ity. When I listen to 
her lyrics, I long to 
understand how the 
words relate to this 
concept of sexual in-
dependence. If any-
thing, the message 1 
get from this song is 
one of sexual depen-
dence - the woman 
is just aching for this 
man to "justify" her 
love. If this woman is 
so independent, why 
would she need her Is Madonna flushing feminism down the toilet? 
love to be justified? 
Somehow, this tune just doesn't make it as 
a feminist anthem. 

Yet, the words and music to this song are, 
in themselves, hannless. After all,l know it 
wouldn't be reasonable to expect thatall pop 
singles convey deep idealistic messages, 
even though it would be nice if the lyrics 
weren't insulting to women. However, when 
the music is paired with images, the mes-
sage of female dependence becomes more 
powerful. 

Madonna's banned-from-MTV "Iustify 
My Love," does nothing to suppon her claim 
that the song is about a woman having sex 
for her own pleasure - on the contrary, the 

entire video is set up to illustrate how a 
woman can use her sexuality to bait, tease, 
and please her man. The video depicts Ma-
donna as a bedraggled, laughing woman 
who meets her boyfriend for a hotel room 
romp. This rendezvous turns into what basi-
cally amounts to a Live! Girls! act for the 
pleasure of the boyfriend - Madonna and 
another woman (with a painted-on mous-
tache) kis and caress each other while the 
boyfriend watches, panling. This is the stuff 
of low-grade soft porn. Very titilating, no 
doubt. 

However, the problem with this stuff is

MADONNA 
Continued from hge H3 
that Madonna touts it as liberating 
to women. In every public state-
ment she has made concerning the 
video, Madonna has insisted that 
the only reason the video was for-
bidden was because it showed a 
woman who was sexually free and 
liberated. Ah, freedom. I guess 
there is no feeling quite as free as 
chaining yourself to abed. I wonder 
if all of Madonna's viewers are 
aware that this is something she 
does to herself and for herself just 
for kicks. 

I want to know you 
Not like that 
I do not think that Madonna is 

evil incarnate. She definitely has a 
philanthropic streak. She has been 
an active spokesperson for gay 
rights and she has done a number 
of A.I.D.S. benefit shows. And in 
the' 80s, her songs and videos dealt 
with themes other than sex. 

"Papa Don' t Preach" told of a 
strong young girl who "has made 
up her mind" and is going to keep 
her baby. While this song did raise 
some eyebrows, it addressed an 
important issue with seriousness 
and thought - and most notably, 
the accompanying video did not 
show any cleavage. 

Ijust wish Madonna, and many 
of the other popular female per-
formers, would continue to write 
and perform as whole, real people 
- instead of simply wind-up dolls 
with boobs. 

Sinead O'Connor, Queer 
Latifa, Bonnie Rain, k.d. Lang 
and Annie Lennox have all man· 
aged to attain success by being 
strong, proud women. Their songs 
address the female struggle for 
equality, and take root in themes 
other than sex. 

Unfonunately, these women are 
all overshadowed by Madonna's 
success. If they were not compel-
ingforthesamespotlightMadonna 
seems to hog, perhaps the public 
would get a chance to listen to their 
messages. Madonna simply to take 
up all of the radio and video ainime, 
leaving little space for her more 
heavily-clothed counterparts. No 
one sells as many records as she 
does. Therefore, many of the truly 
talented, truly feminist singers get 
relegated to the outfield. 

If Madonna were to abandon 
her pre-packaged, money-making 
selling of sex and take a strong 
stand for feminist issues, the waves 
would be felt throughout the in-
dustry - and more importantly, 
throughout the public. Because she 
is such a trendsetter and such a 
success story, I believe that she has 
the power to affect change in the 
industry. 

The adoration she has garnered 
of her fans would not necessarily 
fade if she were to change her 
course. Madonna bas the power to 
make the industry listen to the 
people. Just as Spike Lee has 
criticized Eddie Murphy for not 
taking a more active role in assuring 
equality for blacks, I criticize Ma-
donna for not usine her position to 
insist that she be ponrayed as more 
than an object. Madonna is cur-
rently the most widely listened to 
female spokesperson. Frightening, 
isn't it?

sexual appeal, other female artists 
who mimic her style monopolize 
the market. In such a competitive 
industry, when there is one out-
standing success, all of the other 
people in the field tend to follow 
suit, because they want todo what-
ever sells. And women who have 
the kind of clout of Madonna or 
Janet Jackson should be able to tell 
their producers, their managers, 
their record companies, and their 
audiences that they are not going 
to be wind-up dolls anymore. But, 
of course, just the opposite is 
happening. 

Janet Jackson used to sing about 
"Control," and used to challenge 
men by asking "What Have You 
Done For Me Lately?" She used to 
wear black, military-inspiredcoats 
with long pants, creating a very 
powerful image. 

But now she sings "Love Will 
Never Do Without You," a song 
reinforcing the stereotype that a 
woman is no woman without a 
man. In her video, she wears a 
plunging halter-top, and caresses 
her stomach, arms, and face. Her 
roar turned into a moan. And it is 
happening to almost all of the 
women in the industry. 

Wanting. needing, wailing 
For you to justify my love 
TIle "new feminism" of the '90s 

- was born from the need to re-
lease, even if only in a visually 
erotic fonn - all of the sexual 
repression and fear in the '80s. 
Because of the horror created by 
A.lD.S., the '80s was a strange 

decade for sex. Innuendo was more 
sultl1e. Th;.oe must have been bad 
- James Bond only fuc .. c:d ono 
woman. People were keeping a 
tight reign on their libidos. But, 
enough was enough. While the ef-
fects of AIDS are still being felt, 
the frustration of pent-up sexual 
energy built to the point of no 
control. 

Apparently the attitude is now, 
"If we can't do it, we should at 
least be able to see it." By the time 
the '90s hit, the American public 
was a hard-<>n wailing to explode. 
So, the fernalesingers of the decade 
have decided to indulge it in a little 
slow masturbation. 

Unfortunately, this unleashing 
of sexual energy has occurred in a 
form that is stimulating and re-
warding for the males, but is de-
grading to and objectifying of 
women. II ' s great that men are 
getting this peep show ifit's help-
ing to quell voratious sexual appe-
tites that could be quickly poi-
soned lly AIDS. But, it is not great 
that the women have 10 lose their 
identities as human beings in order 
to become sublimated images of 
forbidden sex and pleasure .• do not 
deny the need for an outlet for the 
sexual lens ion that has been built 
up - [ simply questio.e way. 
which it is being let out. 

If the only way for America to 
deal with sexuality is to see women 
chained to beds, performing for 
men, then how are we women to 
perceive our sexuality? By watch-
ing MTV, we learn that we are no 
better than sado-masochistic 
whores with great bodies. And so 
do the ten-year-old boys.

Sha4eofBrown comes out as more 
politically oriented than its prede-
cessors. 

1bealbum opens with a segment 
of the Mexican National Anthem, 
and continues with the title track 
which is directed toward the 
Mexican-American ("Chicano") 
community, whom L.S.O.B. ad-

vises to "remain brown and proud 
for the nineties." 

"T.J. Nights" is the album's first 
single, and anyone who has taken 
"the 5 to the border" will have 
flashbacks while listening to the 
song. The CD features a remix of 
"T.J. Nights," appropriately sub-
titled "Club Oh Version." 

L.S.O.B.'s rapping style is 
reminiscent of N.W.A.'s, since 
both exploit their ethnic back-
grounds in their lyrics. Brown & 
Proud is an excellent album. Its 
only drawback is that it might lose 
its English-speaking audience with 
the 'Spanglish' (Spanish and En-
glish) lyrics. Taking a Spanish 
Class next quarter might help.

Put Youl'Slllf In My Shoes 
Clint Black 
RCA Records 

Country music is often over-
looked because of its tendency to 
rely on the extremes of gushy 
sentimentalism and humorless 
machismo. Oint Black has man-
aged to draw on some of the more 

lllATUS S 

useful elements ofthese extremes, 
and yet, at Ihesame time, transcend 
them. 

This native Texan has dug deep 
into his bag of tricks to come out 
withPul Yourself In My Shoes. It is 
partly through versatiliry that Black 
has achieved his present starus. 
His ability to juggle different styles 
and sounds shows a maturity and 
integrity badly needed in country 
music these days. 

Black is not afraid to explore 
feelings of love and loss, but it 
would be wrong to accuse Black of 
being overly sentimental. In fact, 
the figure that emerges from his 
music is that of a solid, playful , yet 
sensitive man. 

Listeners looking forothertried 
and true country themes won ' t be 
disappointed. In "One More Pay-
ment," Black's clever word play 
emphasizes the weight of never-
ending debt: "Ain' t that the way 
the rent goes/Seems like its never 
goin ' down/And that banker' s 
bound to foreclose/At thi s rate I'll 
lose my interest in this town." 

He shows signs of slowing a 
bit since his initial success. but one 
can be certain Clint Black will be 
around for awhile .

When baseball players bit the 
diamonds in places like Vero Beach, 

Scottsdale, and Yuma. something tells 
me that spring is in the air. I can feel 
it. I know it. This is my favorite time 
of the year, and I would imagine that 

baseball's Spring Training has dot to 
do with it. 

It's a time of the year when last 
season's often bitter memories are 

wiped clean, and everything begins 
anew. Hope and promise pervade the 

air, from the most powerful team in the 
league right on down to the snuggling . 

. rookie. It's a time of the year that 
allows unknowns like Paul Faries, 

Steve Chitren, and Guy Benjamin to 
become heroes, as it is a time for stars 
like Tony Gwynn, Jose Canseco, and 
Will Clark to reestablish their promi-

nence. It is a time for camaraderie, for 
coaching, for the up-and-coming, and 

for those past their prime. 
But it's also a tune for the fans, 

young and old alike. It is a time for 
them to be a part of the game. It is even 

a time for players to be kids. and kids, 
in a certam sense, to be players. As a 

baseball fan, it is probably the only 
time of the year w~ you can attend a 

game and be just as interested in the 
people around you as you are in those 
that are on the field. Perhaps it's the 
atmosphere. Maybe it's the weather. 

But it's probably the time.

"We were a bunch of wimps,"

overly timid and bent to the will of 
the military. 1 don't think there was 
enough hard-nosed, independent

One member of the audience 
asked the panelists what kind of 
ground rules the journalists would 
set up if they were in charge. Most 
panelists favored getting rid of the

w. POLO 
Conllnued from piIge 18 
about is the status of this year' s 
team, most specifically the goalie 
position. 

Due to the loss of two-time All-
American lefi Paulsen, Harper is 
looking to two inexperienced 
players to fill the void - or net. 

Freshman Alison Westfall and 
senior Dawn Ringhand are com-
peting for the spot, but as of yet, 
Harper has made no definite deci-
sion. 

It is still concei vable that both 
players could share the position. 

Another problem could be ex-
perience, or lack thereof. Harper 
has consistently had 8- 10 players 
with water polo experience. This 
year is somewhat different. 

The Tritons boast four AII -
Americans whom Harper consid-
ers to be among the premier play-
ers in the nation. 

Junio rs Jam ie Dailey and 
Brenda Reiton and seniors Kri ten 
Larson and Christy Parker are, 
according to Harper, "Ihe future 
stars o f the [Un ited States 
women 's] nalional water polo 

BrIen IIOIrrtaI Uu<illUl.ln 
The Tritons are chasing their 
second consecutive crown. 

program." 
According to Harper, there are 

"three distinct levels"lo this years 
team. 

The fi rst is the elite level -
Harper's four standouts. The next 
level is Ihat of the experienced 
players who will contribute imme-
diately to Ihis year's program. 

The third level consists of the 
new players who are slill devel -
oping. 

Among the new players is Erin 
Bakey, a strong aggres ive senior, 
in whom Harper sees great poten-
tial . 

The UCSD Guardian 

In addition, Harper will be 
looking for help from senior 
Christine Townsend. 

As of yet, the roles for the team 
are not set. At this point last year, 
UCSD had already played ten 
games. 

But this year, because some of 
the players we.re swimming, the 
team got a late start. 

According to Harper, he will 
know more about this year's team 
- and where to go with it - after 
this weekend's tournament in Santa 
Barbara. 

"There hasn't been a lot of col-
lege competition yet," Harper said. 
"We' ll know more after [the tour-
nament). " 

In the preseason rankings, 
UCSD is ranked third in the nation, 
with UC Davis and Slippery Rock 
(PA) ahead of the Tritons in the 
polls. 

Harper isn' t too worried. 
"I agree with the polls, but it's 

still preseason," he said. 
One problem forthisyear'steam 

may be a lack ofleadership. While 
Harper's four standouts will be 
stepping in 10 fill the team captain 
role, Harper noted that the team is 

still looking for someone to take 
charge. 

Of course, the biggest question 
surrounding UCSD is can it repeat? 
Harper isn't sure. 

He isn't expecting another 
undefealCd season (26-0-1) like last 
year, but the fact that UCSD is 
hosting this year's NCAA women's 
water polo championships in May 
will deflDitely work in the Tritons' 
favor. 

"We're a very, very good team 
at home," Harper said 

"I think that's a factor some 
teams may underweight." 

One key to a successful season 
for the Tritons will be defense. 
With an unexperienced goalie, and 
lack of depth off the bench, Harper 
said that UCSD must play smart 
defense, and not get itself into foul 
trouble. 

When everything is taken into 
account, it looks like the Tritons 
wiJ] have a long and tough road in 
the coming season. 

UCSD doesn't seem too con-
cerned 

"This program wins," Harper 
said. "It's used to winning, and it's 
going to keep on winning."

CREW 
Conllnued from piIge 18 
year than it has ever placed in the 
Crew Classic before. 

"'!bey have something to prove 
to themselves and to everyone else 
about what the row team is at 
UCSD," he said. " [The competi-
tion) will be lough." 

Shannon said that he anticipates 
the varsity to see tough races from 
UC Santa Barbara and CSU 
Sacremento. "I anticipate the var-
sity will go to the grand final," 
Shannon said. 

"If they row to their potential 
and follow the race strategy and 
plan, [UCSD] should come out a 
winner . . . [with either] a first or a 
second," he said. 

Vengeance is also on the minds 
of the members of the women's 
crew team, but the disturbing 
memories are more recent. 

UCSD has had some disap-
pointing races early this year -
such as USC and Loyola Mary-
mount University, both of whom 
are scheduled to race this weekend 
- and the San Diego Crew Classic 
presents an opponunity for the 
women to test their improvement . 

"For the varsity. this is a chance 
to put all the parts of the race 
together," Head Coach Jack 
Vallegra said. 

"We want to see how much 
we've progressed against middle 
schools ," he said, noting that 
"middle schools" include such 
competitors as CSUS, Mills Col-
lege, LMU, and Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, which comprise the 
women' s varsity 's heat. 

"We haven 't beaten any of these 
fourschools,"hesaid. "We have to 
beat them all and it 's going to take 
quite a bit of racing to do it." 

V allegra said that he thinks that 
his team will be able to beat at least 
two of the crews and will eam a 
place in the final race for the 
Califoria Cup. 

"We're racing faster," he said. 
"Whether it will be fast enough 
[remains to be seen] . 

"Idon't think we've raced upto 
our potential yet," V allegra said. 

In the men's junior varsity 
competition, UCSD will face a 
tough heat from top crew teams 
such as Harvard and Penn. 

"They have to row the race of 
their lives to get in the final and do 
even better to win," Shannon said 

But. he added, "The junior var-
sity is much bener than any [UCSD] 
IV that has been put on the water." 

The men's novice team will also 
have a difficult race due to the fact 
that UCSD 's top novice rowers 
compete at the varsity and junior 
varsity level. 

The women's novice race is 
expected to be a comparison test 
forUCSD. 

"It will bea good test of how we 
compare to crews in the top half," 
Vallegra said. "We know we' re 
faster than the bottom half." 

"[The Classic] is the toughest 
early-season race on the calendar," 
Vallegra said. "It will be a good 
preview as to who the fast schools 
for the end of the year champion-
ship will be." 

Although Shannon feels confi-
dent about his team's chances, he 
warns that the Tritons must con-
centrate on the fllSt race. 

"I don't even think about Sun-
day yet," Shannon said. "We have 
to win on Saturday or we' U we 
watching 00 Sunday. 

"Everything is on the line 00 
Saturday." he said.

we had." 

Indeed, several mishaps slowed 
the Tritons and contributed to their 
ballooned scoring. Senior Matt 
Stottem was playing with a new 
set of irons for the first time and 
sophomore Dale Abraham had 
forgotten to regrip his clubs and 
experienced problems with his 
grips all day long. 

The two tied for fourth on the 
team and 50th overall, scoring 27-
over par 171 s and were unable to 
break the single-round barrier of 
l2-over-par 84. 

Senior Devin Thomas also had 
his share of problems, as he carded 
a very respectable 80 in the moming 
round but soared to 87 in his sec-

ANNOUNCEMENTS 
The Bush Administration cited 
Iraq's possible development of 
nuclear weapons as a reason to 
go to war, while simuhaneously 
violating and undermining the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty by 
obstructing the signing of a 
Comprehensive Test Ban at the 
UN last January. Nuclear testing 
is poisoning our health and 
environment. Join thousands of 
concerned citizens gathering April 
3-8 in a nonviolent action at the 
Nevada Test Site where all U .S. 
and British nuclear tests are 
conducted . Call 277·0991,

PHILLER 
Contlnu.d from pege 18 

In my constant fight with the 
hypocritical nature of college ath-
letics, I tried to block the Rebels 
out of my mind before the tourna· 
ment began. 

I knew these guys were good -
incredible, really - but I wanted 
to see them fall. 

I felt that UNL V' basketball 
team - probably because they are 
from Las Vegas, after all - was 
the easiest culprit for my hatred of 
all that is wrong in colJege athlet-
ics today. 

But over Spring Break, ] de-
veloped a special affinity for that 
team. 

As I sat on the steps of the 
Thomas and Mack Arena in Las 
Vegas in the early morning hours 
of Sunday, March 24 - one day 
after the Rebels had defeated Seton 
Hall to advance to the Fmal Four 
for the second time in two years-
I was able to pack away all of the 
alleged violations into a different 
comer of my mind and recognize 
sports for what they really are: 
entertainment. 

It is certainly not the 
Rebels 'fault that they were an in-
credible team playing in an ath-
letic program probabl y ridden with 
scandal. 

The fact i , here was an unbe-
lievable collection of relatively 
college-age basketball players, all

The UCSD Guardian 

assembled on one team for one 
primary reason. 

To play basketball. 
And, well, they just happened 

to play it beller than most. 
So ] decided, after I blew all of 

my Final Four predictions, that I 
would pull for UNL V to make 
history and become the first team 
to win back-to-back titles since the 
John Wooden teams of UCLA in 
the early ·70s. 

Here was a team - as good an 
example as anything - that really 
deserved to win. 

They just couldn 't lose. Just 
like the A's couldn't lose. 

They had to win. 
They were so good, so com-

posed, so superior. 

But I must have forgotten. I had 
forgotten that this was the NCAA 
tournament, where anything can 
- and does - happen. 

I had forgotten that this kind of 
thing had occurred more often than 
not onate, to the point where it has 
nearly become predictable. 

I guess, on a much larger scale, 
that I had forgotten that these were 
sports-so much like life - where 
the unpredictable and heartbreak-
ing rears its unappealing head more 
often than one would expect. 

In a way, I tried to use sports to 
hide from life. 

As a reflection of life, sports 
cannot possibly function in this 
manner. 

I had forgotten that I was alive.

A Mirror of Life 
YOU KNOW, THEy ' RE FUNNY thing , these thing called sport . 

Ju t when you think you ' re 
sure omething ' going to go a 
certain way, ju t when you are 
positive a certain team is going to 
win, the situation goes awry. 
You can ' t explain it. Major 
up et aren' t supposed to 
happen. The Oakland A' were 
ju t (00 govd to I e. NL V's 
players were just too i/ll'illcible 
to MOp. 

Then you reali,le, the!>e are

~o heartbreaking. These li tt le

And maybe, in a ertain kind 
of way, that 's what make them

W 110 C po ibly forget the apparent uperiorityof 
the Oakland A' , and the evere 
ho ker dealt to them by the Lo 

Angeles Dodgers and the

play? What about the . m th

was derailed in thi year's NFL 
playo ffs, and then the uppo ed 
d minance of the Buffalo Bills in 
the uper Bowl? 

In ten years, you will be hard-
pressed to find an average sport 
fan who remembers the 199 1 
men's college ba ketball 
championship game between 
Duke and Kan as. Sure, that 
game had it exciting moment , 
but nothing will erase the 
memory of Saturday ' emifinal 
game between Duke and UNLV. 

Every time UNL V' Runnin' 
Rebels tepped onto the court 
this year, the c1as ic David and 
Goliath situation pre ented it elf. 
It did not matter to the Goliath 
Rebel - it wa a if they paid 
no attention to whatever little 
David the oppo it ion put before 
them. 

N OT THAT Duke lacked the talent or the ability to beat 
UNL v, but there hasn't been a 
college basketball team made up 
of the kind of players the Rebel 
had for nearly 20 years. Here 
was a collection of All-Stars, 
All-Americans, All-Everything 
- not to mention a host of future 
NBA tars. So what happens? 
The obvious. They lose.

The Tritons knew that they were playing the longest, 
toughe t course they would see this season in Newport 
Beach 's Big Canyon Country Club - a 6,937-yard, par-n

• Tritons blowout 
Whittier 13-4, but fall 
to Christ College 4-1 
By Les Bruvold 
Associate Sports Editor 

It was a definite case of fea t or 
famine fort he UCSD baseball team 
as it blasted Whittier 13-4 Tuesday 
on the road but could only manage 
a single run yesterday, losing 4- I at 
home to Christ College of Irvine. 
The Tritons are now 9-14 on the 
season. 

UCSD battered Poet pitching, 
banging out 18 hits as six Tritons 
had multiple-hit games. But it ap-
peared as though the Tritons left 
their offense in Whittier as they 
had everal men on base against 
CCI - the result of 10 hits - but 
could only drive in a s ingle runner. 

Unbelievably, the Whittier 
conte twa clo e through the sixth 
inning, when the Tritons held a 
slim 5-4 edge over the Poet (5-
16). UCSD, however, opened the 
floodgates in the final three innings, 
scoring nine runs, including a six-
pot in the ninth. 

ErikkAldredge, Louis Diaz, and 
Steve Nowlan each went 3-for-5 as 
all three collected a double. Diaz 
and Nowlan also drove in two runs 
apiece. 

The offensive party didn ' t stop 
there, however, a three more Tri-
tons got into the multiple-hit act.

Softball Splits Pair 
With Christ College 
By Les Bruvold 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD oftball team (13-8) ventured north behind the 
Orange curtain where it split a doubleheader with Chri t 
College of Irvine yesterday. 

The Tritons nailed Christ College 8-3 in the opener, but the 
Eagles fO e from the dead to take the nightcap 6-4. 

Dee Brunk led the Eagles' offensive attack, totalling three 
hits and four RBI in the two games. Lisa Merenda was Christ 
College's pitching star on the day, hurling a complete-game 
victory in the second contest. 

Yesterday's games were a make-up of a doubleheader 
originally scheduled for March 26, but canceled due to rain. 

UCSD Wants Classic Race 
• Preview: Tritons 
expect big things at 
the S.D. Crew Classic 
By Heather Holtzclaw 
Associate Sports Editor 

For the UCSD men's crew team, 
the memories oflast year's San Diego 
Crew Classic are bitter. 

The Tritons were favored to win 
the race for the California Cup at the 
25-team national competition after 
defeating Long Beach State and other 
top-notch teams in the weeks before 
the big race. 

But when the oars hit the water 
that day, UCSD lacked concentra-
tion and left the race empty-handed 
and empty-hearted. 

"We blew it," Head Coach Mike 
Shannon said. "We didn't stick to 
the race plan ... the focus wasn't 
there. 

"They cracked." 
The Tritons have the opportunity 

to avenge that bitter memory at the 
San Diego Crew Classic this week-
end. "A lot of respectable crews [will 
be racing]," Shannon said. confident 
that UCSD will place higher this
