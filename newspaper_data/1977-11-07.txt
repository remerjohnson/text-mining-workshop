452-INFO won't give you EDNA 
Student info system 
.to be installed here 

by Andy Schneider 
Associate News Editor 

It's after hours and all the offices at UCSD are locked up tight. 
The landlord has announced that you 've been kicked out of your 
apartment effective immediately. What are your rights as a 
tenant? You need to know right now, not tomorrow. 

Starting Dec. I, you can get that answer by calling 452·INFO. 
,!he UCSp Business Office is currently implementing a 24-hour 

I~formatlon srstem geared. for students .. At the same time, up to 
five callers wIll be able to lIsten to selectIOns from an initial fifty 
tape library. 

Twenty-five tele-mea tapes, .slectecl by Health Center Director 
Bob Allen. will provide medical advice which helps to identify 
potential health problems. Several tapes will focus on responses to 
~iffer~nt medical emergencies . Another 25 tele-law tapes, 
Identified by Ralph Levens of Student Legal Services, will 
describe student options in various legal situations. 

Recently recruited teletronix operator Carol Taylor will work 
with other campus organizations and services to produce their 
own st~dent informat~on tapes. High on the priority list are tapes 
that Will focus on the times for weekly events, the cafeteria dinner 
menus and bus schedules . 

eletro.ix; a .ew c~mpaterized iaform.tioa eyetem will provide immediate iaform t· t

"The opportunities are limitless," noted Ken Bowers, Manager 
for New Program Development. " It is another way that students 
can get detailed information. It's an easily available credible 
resource." The system is based on the premise that immediate 
information will support better access and increased use of 
existing services. Center for the People: room 

for Third Students to meet 
Both the operator and the script of the tapes will cover the 

options offered by the various programs on campus. Business 
Manage~ Laura ~ichetti stressed ttiat " After listening to the 
general mformatlOn on the tapes, we hope that students will be 
encouraged to seek advice for their individual situations from the 
professionals who are available and willing to help." Information 
over the phone opens up a wide range of new opportunities for 
students who for some reason were unaware that services are 
available to meet their particular needs. 

Balloons, a few crepe paper 
streamers, and nothing less 
tha n a traditional ribbon 
cutting ceremony. Center for 
the People at Third College 
opened last Friday to the 
applause of a standing room 
only crowd. 

Located in the lower level of 
the Third College Commons 
the newly furnished loung~ 
area definitely had a party 
atmosphere. "This is the way 
we hope to keep it all year," 
laughed Dean Bev Varga. She 
.stressed that the new commun-
Ity center and the a<;tivities that 

it sponsors belong to the 
students, faculty and staff who 

hel~d .to mak~ this project 
work 

" It 's a comfortable place 
where members of the Third 
community can come and kick 
back," Clgreed Lyn Baenteli an 
assistant from the Dean's office 
who had been part of the 
planning committee. "There's 
space in the Center for the 
People to rap, play cards study 
and in general have ~ good 
time." 

Open from nine to five each 
day. the community center will 

be staffed by a group of 
student peer counselors. They 
will work with any student or 
stud1!nt group to help -ptan 
workshops. They have also 
been trained to provide 
information about how to use 
campus services and how to 
deal with the bureaucracy. 

" But more important ," 
stated Peer Counselor Sedonia 
Charlot, " we hope that this will 
become a relaxed place to 
s~ialize and find friends to rap 
With about what ever is going 
on." 

(Continued on page 3) 

Designed to improve the flow of communication, teletronix 
creates a central place to direct frequently asked questions . 
Bowers drew an example from EDNA, the student information 
center. " Sometimes the desk receives over fifty calls a day about 
c.afeteria menus. Put the information on tape and valuable work 
time bec.or:n~s free for other stud.ent questions or new projects." 

When Imtlated, DIAL INFO Will become the first on the West 
Coast and one of three universities in the na tion which offer a wide 
range of student info over teletronix . Several regional county 
~rograms have provided a similar service, but this project is a 

f~rst among schools. Using the teletronix system, one operator can 
fIll up to 1800 requests for information a day. The number and 
types of tapes are virtually unlimited.

could take penonal credit for 
having done tbe work to 
organize tbe community

indicative of tbe group 
approach that bas been taken 
toward the project since ill 
inception. 

Tbe original plan for tbe 
Center for tbe People was 
drawn up by Marsha Harris. 
ServiDl as a council member, 
she submitted the proposal to a 
vote of the coUege studenta who 
gave tbeir overwbelming 
approval io the Spring referen-
dum . She recalled that, "The 
goal for the Tbird College 
Council WII to unite faculty, 
students and staff with a feeling 
of unity. We needed a general 
meeting place. This commun-
ity center gives students the 
chance to provide service for 
others." 

The Center for the People

transition for social life at

During the past several years the simple "PH Story" has been told over 
and over. Besides preserving nature's Acid Mantle of 4.5-5.5 ph, 
shampoo must contain NUCLEOPROTEfNS DNA and RNA. These 
essential building blocks in the polypeptide chain repair damaged protein 
in the same ratio from which it is naturally depleted from the hair!! A full 
complement of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and coen-
zymes hydrolized to the correct siie· and weight penetrate the hair shaft 
and are utilized by the NUCLEOPROTEINS to reconstruct hair damage.
