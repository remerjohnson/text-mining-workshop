SDSU Year Ends With Students Protesting Budget 
By Wileen Wong 
Staff Writer 

Recent tate budget cut have 
not only affected UCSD, but San 
Diego State University as well. Al-
though SDSU is facing a 20 percent 
fee increase instead of the Univer-
sity of California's 40 percent in-
crease, the SDSU administration has 
made drastic cuts, removing 550 
class sections as well as reducing it 
taff by hundreds. 

According to George Cole. as-
si tant director of Communication 
at SDSU, because of the budget 
crisi , three tenured counselors have 
been laid off, 300 to 400 part-time 
staff members who teach one or two 
classes will not be rehired, and 100 
to 150 administrators, custodians, 
and non-teachers (i.e. from the Ath-
letic Departtnent) will be laid off. 

SDSU student Linda Henry aid 
she i concerned that while students 
are facing a proposed 20 percent fee 
increase, there is no guarantee that 

all the money will go back to the 
California State University system. 

UC tudents, however, are guar-
anteed that the extra money will be 
spent within the UC system. 

"I'm deeply concerned for the 
future," aid SDSU senior Amanda 
Love. "I thi going to set a prece-
dent? Many of the propo ed cuts are 
to faculty who are vital to the future 
of education." 

In com pari on to SDSU, Cole 
aid "UCSD is mailer. They have 

a bit more of an ability to cap enroll-
ment. [UCSD] is also more difficult 
to get into. It has a system built 
where it can control enrollment more 
than SDSU." 

Forthis reason, he added, budget 
cuts have a different impact on the 
two campuses. 

In response to the recent budget 
cuts and fee increases, SDSU stu-
dents have held several protests and 
rallies. According to Cole, SDSU 
studentsareconcemed with the quai-

ity of education after budget cuts. 

One of the protests, a tea h-in/ 
walkout held by the Student Move-
ment for Education on May 8, in-
volved an estimated 6,000 students. 

Many SDSU professors can-
celed classes so they and thei r stu-
dents could attend the rally.

Senate Approves Change in Central Library Bell Schedule 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Staff Writer 

Due to measures approved by 
the UCSD Academic Senate at its 
meeting last Tuesday, the simulated 
bells that "ring" from speakers atop 
Central Library will be heard more 
fn:quently in the future. 

The Carillon Advisory Commit-
tee recommended several changes 
to thecomputer-generated bells' pro-
gram, which were slightly amended 
by the Conunittee 00 Campus and 
Community Environment (CCCE) 
before being accepccd by the Aca-
demic Senate. 

In addition to the current sched-
ule of ringing on the hour, the bells 
will chime twice on the half hour 
between the hours of7 am. and 10 
p.m. every day. 

A numberof"concerts" wiU also 
beperfonned. A IO-minuteconcert 
will be heard once a week at 5 p.m., 
as well as weekend concerts like 
those played at last year's gradua-
tion. 

Graduation day this year will be 
complemented by the same concert 
pieces as last year, perfonned at 
8:30 am., 11:30 am., 2:30 p.m., 
and 4:30 p.m., as long as these times 

do not interfere with any college's 
ceremony. 

Tapping the Carillon as a "p0-
tential artistic resource," the com-
minee suggested that a contest be 
held for the best original student 
arrangement, and that a $100 prize 
be offered. 

Theproposalofadaily IO-minute 
noon concert was rejected by the 
CCCE, and subsequently the Aca-
demic Senate, because such con-
certs may interfere with other cam-
pus activities. 

The CariUon Advisory Commit-
tee, although temporary, will fol-

low through on the programming 
changes. 

In other business, the senate also 
approved amendment to Academic 
Senate Bylaws, adding the chair of 
the Committee on Affirmative Ac-
tion as a member of the Representa-
tive Assembly, the Senate Council, 
and the Senate-Administration 
Council. The amendment also re-
quires that, when the chair of the 
Academic Senate is not from the 
general campus, a fonner chair will 
be appointed to perfonn the chair's 
duty as a member of the Program 
Review Committee.

Scripps Voyage to Study Ocean 
Circulation, Atmospheric Change 

UCSD', Scripps In titutionofOceanography launched 
the research vessel Thomas WashinglOn Friday on an 
ex pedition to study world ocean circulat.ion and its impact 
on global aun pheric conditions and the climate. 

Scientist · aboard the resean:h vessel will undenake a 
nine-month compreheru i ve program to rneasu re the phys-
ics andchemistryofthe Pacific as pan of the World Ocean 
Circulation E periment (WOCE). 

During nearly 120 days at sea, the expedition will 
foLlowa hip track coveri ng about 14.000 mile ,allowing 
re earcherstocollectth usandsofwatersamplesfromthe 
surfnce to great depths, continUOUSly measuring water 
temperature and salini ty . 

These sample will reveal the ocean' chemical prop-
erties and will be used as sources of data for defining the 
circulation of hallow and deep ocean current . which is 
especially imponantsin e theclimare may be changing in 
ways not experienced since the last ice age. 

Scripp sociate Profe or Lynne Talley e plained 
that data oblained on the voyage will be c mpared with 
studiescondu ted decades agotodctermineclimatechange, 

"There is a new urgency to kn w more precisely than 
ever before the detail of where ean waters flow, how 
quickly they mi;< into the ocean depths. and their role in 
distributing heat around the globe," 'aid cripps Director 
Edward Frieman. 

''TIle tremendou ' amount of data th;u WOCE will 
produce will be a giant step toward unde tanding the 
ocean as a global entity and leaming how it influences the 
atmosphere and climate change," Frieman said.

capture the amount of material needed to generate that much

UCSD Extension Receives Grants 
To Train Local Science Teachers 

UCSD Extension received a .$928,000 grant from the 
National Science Foundation to fund the second phase of 
an intensive scientific trJining program for elementary 
school science teachers. 

Exten ion was also given a $651,938 grant by the 
Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematic ' and Science Educa-
tion Program to begin a scientific training program for 
primary and secondary schoolteachers. 

The grants represent an expansion of UCSD Biology 
Professor Paul Salonan' efforts to link UCSD science 
faculty and resources with public educators. 

Under the direction of Robert and Melanie Dean, co-
directors of UCSD Elltension's Science and Technology 
Teacher Enhancement Program, the programs will com-
bine the academic resources of major local education 
in titutions toaddres the needs of science education in San 
Diego and Imperial counties. 

The Deans, former science teachers , explain that 60 
percent of students in the San Diego Unified School 
District are underrepre ented, and 25 percenr have limited 
English proficiency. 

Imperial County, which has the highest percentage of 
limited English proficiency students in California, will 
pre ent a more challenging problem. 55 percent oflmpe-
rial County tudents live below the povelty line. 

Los Alamos Scientists Can Detect 
Individual Molecules in a liquid 

Scientists at the Los AJamos National Laboratory have 
developed the technology that will allow them to detect 
individual molecules in liquid solution. 

The new technology has the potential for numerous 
wide-ranging application in biology, chemistry, andenvi-
ronmental monitoring .. 

Researchers could use it to monitor the dispersal of 
extremely low concentrations of pollutants, analyze serum 
or other biomedical samples, ordetect minuIC quanritiesof 
enzymes or proteins on the surfaces of cell or viruses. 

Scienti t have for some time observed individual 
molecules trapped in a vacuum, where they are isolated 
and relatively easy to detect, but in a liquid. many billions 
of other molecules surround the molecu le being studied. 

The Los AJamos re carchers use a fluorescent dye in 
their technique. They've hown they can detect the fluo-
rescence, or light emission, from a si ngle dye molecule 
passing by theirdetector wi th about 85 percent efficiency.

SDSU: Students launch creative protest against cuts in staff, classes 
Continued from page 1 
The Daily ktec, the purpose of the 
teach-in/walkout was "to protest the 
budget cuts proposed by Governor 
Pete Wilson." Protest coordinator 
D.C. Grant said that student must 
get involved and send a me age to 
Sacramento that they oppo e 
Wilson's proposed budget and the 
major cut planned for education. 

According to theA: tec ,the teach-
in/walkout was one of the largest 
prote t in the history ofSDSU, and 
began as a discussion with both 
faculty and tudents regarding the 
state's economic situation and how 
the university will be a ffectcd by the 
budget cuts. 

"I think [the teach-in/walkout! is 
great ... we need to do it. said Ed 
Montoya, aLi beral Arts sophomore. 
We're paying all thi s money and 
[are) not getting what we want. 
There are too many classes being 
cut. I don't want to graduate in 10 
years." 

Be ides holding the rally, SDSU 
recently de ignated a plywood wall 
surrounding a construction site on 
campu as a political canvas to ex-
pres concerns for the recent budget 
proposal. 

Cole said that the wall was "a 
new canvas for political art , painted 
with great care and sincerity. There 
is a lot of pol itical and urban art 
geared toward [SDSU President 
Thomas) Day, Wilson, and taxpay-
ers."

"There is no endorsement to tear

because you disagree with them," 
he said. 

According to Wat on, misun-
derstandings concerning Y AF's 
right to post flyers caused some to 
be removed, but "that matter has 
been clarified. There is no longer 
any confu ion about their right to 
put up posters. " 

Kanelos said he felt that the uni-
versity did not fulfill its obligation 
to clarify its policies on flyers, He

Among the artwork on the protest wall at SDSU is a listing of 
people arrested while defending the protest paintings. 

As commencement e;<ercises 
approached, Day wanted to paint 
over the wall for fear that it may 
offend some fami Iy members or the 
graduating rudents. 

To prevent the painting, a "wall 
vigil" was organized to guard the 
construction fenceon May 21. Pro-
testing student brought sleeping 
bags and food . 

On the morning of May 22, eight 

therefore they are the re pon ibility 
of the university." 

Y AF members have also charged 
that UCSD Director of Affirmative 
Action Programs Anthony Jemison 
supported the removal of flyers and 
is in league with the Student Affir-
mative Action Committee, the 
Women's Resource Center, and 
other organizations to di credit the 
censorship charges. 

"The reason I know that is that 
[at SAAC], they all use the same 
wording in claiming the po ters are 
unfactual," Kanelos charged. 

"Jemison i their ring leader," 
Geiler said. 

Brian Slack, the SAAC repre-
sentative to the African American 
Student Union,said that the removal 
of flyers as an issue was never ad-
dressed at SAAC meetings. 

Jemison was out of town and 

SDSU students were arrested for 
refu ing to leave their po ts at the 
fence. 

Markes Rodgers, one of the stu-
dents arrested, said, "We wanted 
the whole wall saved." 

The May 23 is ue of the Los 
Angeles Times stated that "The stu-
dent began putting together a 
counter offer, but. by 3 !l.m .. the 
protestors were arrested by campus 

unavailable for comlllent. 
The Y AF has received local 

media attention as a result of the 
alleged cen orship. 

Articles in the May 23 i 'ue of 
the Los Angeles Times and the Sail 
Diego Union, radio shows on sev-
eral stations, and KNSD-TV have 
reported on the alleged censorship 
of the flyers . 

In addition, according to Geiler, 
national magazines have expressed 
interest in the tory. 

The C-Span television network 
will air a news pre entation on the 
"Politically Correct" movement, 
which will include coverage of the 
Y AF flyers at UCSD. 

Geiler aid the media attention is 
necessary, since according to him, 
the "PC" movement to stifle free 
peech is currently under national

police, with the assistance of about 
a dozen San Diego police officers." 

According to Cole. Day listened 
to his council, met with faculty and 
students, and reached an agreement 
to let the major piece of the canvas 
on the west side of the fence remain. 
The nonh and . outh wall. were 
painted over in green. 

ince then. however, new mes-
, ages have been painted on the wall. 
Cole explained. 

He added that m re than 60 
people were involved with the paint-
ing of the wall. 

" ltwastheeffon fmany.many 
people." he said ... It expressed the 
sincere feding of their beliefs of tile 
imponance of education in Califor-
nia." 

According to ole. DSU stu-
dents have been very concemed. l-le 
said that he felt that the demonstra-
tions have been sincere. and pre-
sented aniculate and thought-out 
concerns. 

When asked why the students 
have taken a srrong stance soquickly 
to protest the budget cut ,Cole re-
plied. "There are 35,000 IUdent at 
SDSU compared to 13.000 at 
UCS D. The students here take on a 
more urban beat. especially about 
issues involving dollars and cents." 

"Day' early de ision brought 
[the issue] to the front of the burner 
early," he added. 

According to ole. controversy 
and tudent protests surrounding the 

budget cut have not just attacked 
Sacramento and Govemor Pete 
Wilson, they have also larg.; ted 
Day. 

According to Cole. "Pre, ident 
Day was convinced that solution. 
from Sacramento will not come 
this year. I Hel believed it was im-
ponant for him to be candid and 
open, so he decided to make his 
decisions now instead of later." 

Some faculty members do not 
agree with Day's decision to make 
cuts. 

David Storm, president 
DSU's alifornia Faculty Asso-

ciation. said, "We have $40m i Ilion 
dollars that we are spcndlllg on 
spons [at SDSU I. Less than 10 
percent of our athletes graduate 
[fromltlle university. Why J n't 
wt! take some of that $40 million 
and give it to classes?" 

"We don 't have to cut classes 
or facu lty," he said. "but we have 
to change the priorities of this 
[university's] president and ot:,er 
presidents." . 

According 10 part-time SDSU 
English Professor Jim Mack. "They 
don't want to see some more ere-
ativesolutions tothe financial prob-
lem. like we [protestors 1 do. For 
example. President Day ha~$2 mil-
lion in lottery funds he is reserving, 
panially for a new computer. That 
$2 milli n wouldn ' t ~olve the bud-
gel problems we have. but it would 
be a ~tal1:' 

ERRATUM 
In the May 30 issue of the Guardian, Governor Pete 
Wilson 's office, where the Coalition to Save Education 
plans to stage a protest on June 5, was mistakenly 
listed as "401 B Street." The actual address is 1350 
Front Street. The Guardian regrets the error.

Some A.S . members have sa id that, because they are stu-

need the money. perhaps they would be better off re-focusing 
their val uable time and crfon on an endeavor with;] higher

The A.S. is a service organization. funded by student fees,

that would go toward couneil members ' tipends would be 
much better spent on allocation for student organization or 
uctivities - groups and causes which could not function 
otherwise without A. . support. 

Hopefully Orozco's velO was based on good ethi s, and not

heart of this. The chairman of 
MEChA was in the midst of be-
moaning oppression when he 
pointed to me"'lnd said, " 1 heard 
that your father has 12 maids in 
his house." Yeah. right, and my 
father also owns a sweat shop 
where he forces I O-year-oldchil-
dren to work l4-hourday . TIlese 
people are so busy fighting te-
reoLypes that they don ' t realize 

When 1 Maned wri ting my column, I never ex-
pected the hate and resentment that ideas contrary to 
the Left', would bring. Surprisingly, I have found that 
the thrust of theIr attacks tumed out to be directed 110t 
at my polittcal ideology, but at my elf. 

A good illuMffition of th is occlln-ed during the war. 
Late on a Friday afternoon. I wal.ked into the Food Co-
opand noticed one of my article on the wall. In red ink 

meone had wri tten on it, "Tired of fa!>ci t journal-
ism') So are we. Just a waming!" 

Thi> incident embodies my point perfectly. 1 was 
threatened for Ihe sole reason of expressing a contro-
versial polilil:al view. I was warned that 1 had better 
·top ~hanng my thoughts with other people. or else. 

nd they call me a fas iSI. 
Outofthe .ra ofcampu a tivi ' t .Ihavefoundthe 

\Voman' Re., ource Center to be the most avaricious 
barracuda. They are the least accepting of dis ident -
or as they ay "capi tali t pig ." I once mentioned to a 
WRC activist Ihat 1 was planning 10 do a commentary 
on EI Salvador. After telling me how [ have made 
many peaceful people want to beat me up. she said. "I 
am waming you. don 't write that article'" 

Another in ident involving WRC intimidation oc-
curred right before my article questioning tbe alloca-
tion of $87.000 to their organization. Upon bearing 
thatl intended to question thefunding,arepresentative 
came up to me and said, "If ou write that article, we 
have plans ...... To which I lcplied, "1 n' t that censor-
ship through intimidation?" No reply. 

Perhaps J should join SAAC because 1 seem to be 
one of the most stereotyped people at UCSD. [ have 
simply been cast and written-off like an equation. 
" UI.ra-con ervative,""less progressive than Anila the 
Hun," "raci t," and, of course, "sexist" are all tenns 
that have been hurled my way. 1 have been built into 
S1:me oppressive monster based on second-hand ac-
counts of my articles, and rumors. 

It is a dreary commentary on mankind when the 
cultural and political Left - the elf-proclaimed bas-
tion of acceptance - stereotype people on the ba is 
of a mall portion of their belief . 

Events at a recent SAAC meeting strike right at the 

when they lapse into the commit ting the evil they so 
gallantly battle. 

Even the LGBA anti-hate crime. rally had a 
couple of [-hate-the-Guardian!Bennan peakers. 
Mixed in with stories about how he was hated "just 
bec\luse I'm gay," onespeakermadesuretoca t a few 
hateful cheap shots about the Guardiall and yours 
truly. Why? 

nd lthoughnhe rally was uppo ed to beagaillst 
hate, rather than to cast hate upon those who differ 
politically. 

At the rally, they also played a recording of the 
threatening calls received before the LGBA dance. 
TIley hould have included someofthe messages that 
have been left on Illy answering machine. 

But we all know they wouldn't do that, for then 
they would no longer appear as though they have a 
monopoly on personal victimization. r pre ume some 
members of the distinguished Left would ay I de-
serve such trC<1tment. Unfonunately, I have heard the 
same said about them. 

Another intere ting incident happened just a few 
weeks ago. One campus radical dec ided to call me 
"pathetic." When I asked why, he aid, "You wanted 
to nuke Iraq and tattoo the gays." 

Eventhoughladvocated low-yield nuclear trikes 
on hardened military targets in the Kuwaiti desert, 
away from civilians, and suggested lauooingmen and 
women as a solution to quelling the A.I.D.S. epi-
demic, [ asked him if he read the articles. His re-
ponse: "No, but I saw the headline." Great way to 

judge someone. 
Of course, the Left' response to all this will 

involve cloaking their hate under the euphemism of 
frustration. Yet it isobviousthattheir actions go much 
further than just those of frustration. 

In the end it does not maner. Most othernations of 
the world have people killing each other over political 
views - I shou Id not complain. It is just sad when one 
realizes that the Left 's view of peace and love turns 
out to be nothing more than a hotbed of political 
hatred. 

Oh. well. There are always the nnarchi ts.

COMMENTARY 

What Does the new indicator Really Indicate? 
• By circumventing reasoned debate, the new indicator betrays the students and liberty 
By Matthew Seott Robinson 
Staff Writer 

Every quarter! do my best to di play in the 
mo t manife t way [ know how my open 
mind. I'm hip to all tlle new fads, and 1 realize 
that to be cool nowadays one musI "do" P.c. 
With the interests of being lolerant and sensi-
tive and to bristle wi th that W3ml fuzzy fee l-
ing that accompanies the homage of worship-
ing the gods of multicultur.ll ism, 1 decided to 
open up the journal that does battle against the 
forces of oppres ion. the nell' indicaTOr. for a 
thorough study. 

Bear in mind that the new indicator ab-
orbs approximately 30 percent of the 

ASUCSD media budget. After reading one 
year's wonh of the lIell' illdicator, I began to 
question the wisdom of this decision. Indeed 
how much do commentaries such as the fol -
lowing contribute to the university? 

Eventually it became clear to all, this ex-
CIA maniac with blood still/resh 011 his hands 
jromPanama had to be King of the World. the 
Great White God, Alld the Father 0/ the She 
Beast all rolled into a testicle burrito. Nurem-
burg-like rallies. with Alperf Speerian 'thou-
sand poillls of light' were i/l filII jingoistic

trolled clear-CIl110rest-come-newspaperand 
011 a hLlndred mil/ioll irradiared irrirarillg nOll 
biodegradable hell-ol-visions. (March 18, 
1991 ). 

Unfortunately, what thenell' indicaror rep-
resents is not any coherent ideological thrust. 
The first time I picked upan issue, 1 had hopes 
of hearing a sophisticated and aniculate Left-
ist perspective. Although it fli es the banner of 
liberalism. I wonder if the new illdicator has 
any consciousness of the ideology behind its 
creed - barring occasional sloganeering. 

John Stuart Mill would be lost and even 
dismayed at modem liberali m.TIlenew indi-
caror certainly does not display the subtle 
reasoning and articulation that ought to char-
acterize democratic dialogue. "Ought," as the 
attentive reader will note, i a strong state-
ment implying moral pre cription. 

Reasoned and rational debate is conducted 
in democratic ociety with an eye towards the 
persuasioll of the citizen. An:-,one who picks 
up a /lew indicator notices that th is is not the 
objective of the wri ting. If it is, then its staff is 
guilty of complacency. 

Moral autonomy, the ability of the indi vid-
ual to act free of restraint and to choose his 
own good and the good of others, defines

democracy. Reason accompanies, fa ilitates, 
and complements this moral autonomy by 
allowing individuals to provide for their own 
destiny through collective action. 

Difficult deci ions must be made. and it is 
pre upposed that the e di scu sion of 
tradeoff , ri sk , and cost are done among 
oppo ing groups which meet on the common 
ground of reason. One may not like an oppo -
ing idea, but the re peet of hearing orpromul-
gating it with cogent argumem shows respect 
for our fellow citizens. 

Disre peet, and arguably, hatred, are man-
ifest in the individual who abandons this idea. 
One may indeed preach diversity, sensitivity. 
tolerance. or whatever the watchword. but we 
all are familiar with the duplicity that may 
accompany actions in the political realm. 

Diver ity new indicaror-style has two "pre-
sumpt ion "ofwhich"thesecondistheprima-
ry emphasis on the individual and attitudinal 
[sic] components of r.lcism with the concur-
rent oversight of the structural roots of white 
power and privilege" (Nov. 28). TIlis was not 
wriuen by a new indicator staff member- it 
was from Vennont- but it made the front 
page. But this leads one to a k what is meant 
by such obscurantist language. 

Steeped in article pleading fordemocracy 
and wailing at oppression, the Ilew illdicator 
provides the university student with political 
analysis like the March 18, "The Great Amer-
ican Orgasm"whichevaluates war. It contains 
such insightful analyses as the following: 

The same rich old men appear 011 TV and 
give fong dissertations 011 how abortioll is 
killing? Is rheir hiddpn agenda to produce 
more babies so when they (urn eighteen rfrey 
call kill them in a war?

the new indicator does not recommend this 
prank, we do feel that 'creative l:rime is not 
only good for thesoul in this day and age. it '~ 
neces ary '''(Nov. 14). 

Here we may therefore distinguish the 
modem Left and our classic understanding of 
liberalism. The nell' illdicawr is more like 
irreverent iconocla ts raging against the tem-
ples of history. They see history populated 
only by dead white males. not the noble 
aspirations of humanity striving for freedom 
or to understand the experien e of life.

my way." 

Such frivolous attitudes toward the reader 
are antithetical to democmcy. insulting, and 
are as readily a force for the totalitarianism 
defended . o energetically in the pages of the 
IICW indiCa/or. It was Alexis de Tocqueville 
who presented the most accurate picture of 
tyranny. With a mass society and individuals 
standing cold in the fa 'e of their peers, intim-
idation and base rhetoric rule the day. The 
ship of state becomes hostage to every hap-
hazard gust of the radical. 

By circumventing rea oned argument, the 
lie II' indicalor is guilty of stripping students of 
the knowledge nece sary to preserve liberty 
and the climate for its sustenance. I ' there 
liberty of opinion when only a fis t raised in 
anger distinguishes arguments and "right" is 
the dictate of the strong and inflamed? 

The 1lt'1I' illdicator is quite dedicated to it 
cause. It pages brim with addresses to write 
for more infonnation and are pell-mell wi th 
meetings and opportun ities for activism. Yet 
it is difficult to rl!ad beyond page one wi thout 
the reader' s reason being drowned in rhetoric 
and foul language. 

For instance, in an articlenotingtheenergy 
conserved in the use of one compact fluores-
cent bulb, the reader is captured by the follow-
ing: ''Thor" sjllst Olll' dam 11 bulb. ill one house. 
olle aparrmelll. or aile offic£'. ill OIlC dU1II1I 
slIbllrba ll area . 011 1' cOllt ill l'lIl. olle 
plalll'l. ·'(April ). 

Some of the articles, indeed, let me add 
many. are well researched. But the ideas are 
ultimately prostituted by foul language. shouts 
f conspiratorial theory. distnlctingly poor 

grammar. and a disdain for socielY. 
When enlightened debate b h<!c louded by 

,uch un ophisticated thinking. it may make 
one wish to walk away from Ihe Republic 
entirely. To wil.the writing in the lieu' il/dica· 
lor seems more devoted 10 mobilizing en-
raged fanat ics rather than persua~ive dialogue 
presented in a cool, ra tional way? 

"For it is stamped in the etemal nature of 
things that men of intemperate minds cannot 
be free." noted Edmund Burke. "Thei r pas-
sions forge their fetters." 

Democracy is doomed by the vice of her 
citizens and preserved by the virtue of her 
inhabitants. With this in mind r think the 
fustian rants of the Ill'W illdicalor preclude 
dialogue and ought best be used on bumper 
stickers on the backs of VW 's and old Pinto~.

Ni k Long. fonner UCB chair.

of the copy center said. "We use

regularpaper."Thus, Ihere isclcarly 
a choice. 

It is also stated in the article. 
"recycled papernonnall y costs more

Thi is simply not true. In fact , the 
cost of producing recycled paper is 
less than the production cost of pa-
per made directly from trees. Paper 
from the recycling bin is easier and 
cheaper to process into a new sheet.; 
the cost of growing, cutting, trans-
porting,grinding, and bleaching new 
trees is much greater; this does not 
include the cost to our cities for 
using landfi II pace and the immense 
damage wreaked on the forests 
around the world. The reason why 
recycled paper is nol cheaper than 
regular paper hingeson the fact that 
currently there are not as many re-

Editor: 

In respon e to the commentary 
by Jonathon Traynham in the Tues-
day, May 28 GLlardian, I would like 
to point out that his attempt to "[let]

Absolutely nothing. The voicing of

not wander into the rcalm of insult.

"The issue was clarified by go-

said.

"we're being censored by the new

He added, "We're just po,ting

construe that a~ theatrical at all." 

Slack argued that Y AF members 
"are missing the point here. These 
flyers are attacking affirmative ac-
tion by saying .. Are quotas right or 
wrong.' The affirmative action ~y~­
tern does not use quotas." 

Letters to the Guardian from 
Jemi on also reinforced Slack's 
statement.

Patiently waiting for a "date," Mark lives out of a duffle bag at the intersection of Sixth and Laurel in Balboa Park. 

The Pick-up 

According to Sullivan, the 
dialogue at a potential pick-
up typically runs as follows: 
"Hey, what you up to?" "Oh 

nothing. Just cruising 
around." uOh yeah?" "How 

'bout you?n "Oh, me too, 
uh.. just cruising around. I'll

tricks for survival 
By Daniel L. Calvi 
Staff Writer 

Do you want a date?" 
"Scott" sniffled and bent 
into the half-opened wi n-
dow of the grey Me rcedes 

sedan. Out of the comer of hi s eye he saw 
a car seat. Family man, he thinks. 

"What are you into?" 
The driver had been cruising around 

the park, circ ling the block, for about 
three hours that night. 

Scott and the other hustlers under the 
s treetl ights on the fou r comers of the 
intersection at Sixth and Laurel in Ba lboa 
Park , had caught hi s eye several time 
over the course of the evening, and had 
pinned him as a gas queen - one who 
drives around the circle but lack the 
courage to actually stop. 

He finally pulled over, slowed to a 
crawl. and parked near the curb where 
Scott was waiting and sniffling. 

Scott was tweaking. Tweaking-out on

2 o 'clock P.E. class. His outfit consisted 
of sunglasses, a tank-top, biking ~horts

cock - high-tops, and a backpac/ in 
which he carried condoms, lube. and his 
s tudent 1.0. from Linda Vista High

To 16·year-o ld Scott, they are tricks, 

johns, bucks, Jares - the customers who 
feed him, pay the rent at hi s flea-bag 
studio apanment, and suppon hi s habit 
- sniffle, sniffle. 

They left to find somewhere dark to 
park. 

"Tom," unlike the other ski nnier. 
'scrawnier sex-industry worker, looked 
strong and well -fed. He looked as if he'd 
eaten a wholesome, home-cooked meal 
with all four food groups before coming 
down to the park to turn tricks. 

In fact, Tom ' mother wa n ' t at home

+Where will that $6.50 end up this summer? 
By Andy Clarke 
a nd Gregory Waypa 
Staff Writsrs 

humpagne ('ork~ didn't ex-
plo(1e in Hollywood last year. The 
,ummer movies of 1990 seemed to 
prove thai 'big' really doe n't equal 
'grem: For the first time in many 
year.., \i tting on a beach proved to 
be far more alluring than spending 
6.50 on various mega-budget be-

hemoths. 
You can blame it a ll on 

" Batman," the 1989 Guber-Peters 
epic thai gro sed $25 I million in the 
U.S. alone. The movies suddenly 

~ und themselves uffering from a 
~evere case of blockbu ter fever. 
Yet in 1990 it was two low-budget 
romantic comedies that beat ev-
erylhing else that the blockbusters 
c uld throw at them. "Robin Hood 
: Prince of Thieves:' "Hudson 
Hawk" and "Temlinator 11: Judg-
mo::nt Day" aside, the 1991 summer 

~ea~on ~eellls to di~play a scaling 
down of the budget~ in favor f 

100~er-risk, higher-return movies. 
Love them or hate them, "Prelly 

Woman" and "Ghost" have made 
thi~ year's films t:onsiderably qui -
ete r. But of the S5 movies t be 
released in the ~ulllmer 1ll0nth~. 
wh ich ones de;.elvc your patronage? 

Below, we offer a few suggestions: 

"Backd raft" 
Starring William Bald win, Kurt 
Russell, Scott Glenn, Rebecca de 
Mornay, Donald utherland, 
Robert de Niro, j enifTer jason 
Leigh 
Directed by Ron Howard 

Two brothers follow their father 
into the firedepartmenlofthe Windy 
City. To reateanonly-in-the -mov-
ies enario, their pop wa:, I..illed in 
a blaze, thus creating many emo-
tional scenesofBaldwin and Ru!>~e ll 
trying to outdo each ther in their 
attempt to emulate their father. 
Differences have to be put a.-.ide, 
however. as an arsonist runs .unok 
through Chicago, with Roben de 
Niro in hot pursui t. 

Imagine"Silen eofthe Lambs," 
"Jagged Edge" and "The Towering 
Inferno" put together, and you have 
the premiseof" Backdr.lft."The lat-
est film from former child tar Ron 
Iloward ("'Parenthood") is spe -
ta ular and manipulates your emo-
tion as mu h as po sible. What 
"Top Gun" did for Tom Cruise, 
"Backdraft" will do for"Aatliners" 
actor Billy Baldwin, despite the in-
sipid ex pression he has throughout 
most of the movie. !-Io.ve er, thc

"Hud on Hawk" 
Starring Bruce Willi , Andie 
MacDowell, Danny Aiello, andra 
Bernhard, james oburn, Rich-
ard E. Grant 
Direcled by Michael Lehmann 

Bruce Willis plays the world-
fmnous cat burglar of the movie's 
title, who is forced to teal once 
more to save the life of his fonner 
partner Tommy "Five Tone" 
Messina. Cameras rolling, budget 
soari ng, Hawk becomes embroiled 
in the theft of three Leonardo cia 
Vinci artifacts that will allow the 
unlimited production of gold. Along 
the way. Willis become embroiled 
with nun (or is it spy?) Andie 
MacDowell. 

" Hudson Hawk" is po ibly the 
most confused and confu ing 
blockbu ter to ever hit the silver 
screen. Following in their tradition 
of not spending a dollar when a 
million will do , producer Joel Sil-
ver("Die Hard2")and Bru eWillis 
have produced a supposed com-
edy-thriller that is totally devoid of 
both comedy and thrill>. The plot is 
unintelligible and overall, "Hud~n 
Ilawk" isn't even worthy ofa "yip"

There isn't much that an be said

Small Surprise - a Morose 
Morrissey in Concert 
By Jeff Stodell 
Staff Writsr 

Surrounded by beach ball~ and 
black-clad teenyboppers. Morri~;,e em-
barked n the tour his fans have patient-
ly waited forever si nce his '87 br~aJ.-up 
with The miths. Fr m tan to finish, 
his chaotic. unpretlil:table Thursday 
night show at the ports rena wa:, 
plagued b over-zealou, fan, and an 
inc,\perienced bacl..-up band. Even 
though Morris,ey 's pa~sionate singing 
proved to be the conce l" s only ~aving 
grncc. he may we ll d 'serve to be de-
pressed if this show i, any indication of 
what' s to come in the tour', ne,\t _6 
dates. 

One problem with the concert W'L~ 
that Morrissey actual Iy became a victim 
of his own gentleness and sincerity. 
Fans poured onto the stage in drove" 
and neither Morrissey nor security knew 
what to do about it. Morris~ey greeted 

his firs t few 
"visi tors" 

with hand-

shakes and sh J1 eJllbrace~, nnd seemed 
genuinely pleased to share the spotlight 
with them. As Ihe songs continllect, 
though, the crowd seemed to forget all 
about the music. and everybody's goal 
seemed to be nothing more than gellin;;

textured pop song - rang oul. 

Kevin Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio star as Robin Hood and Maid Marian in one of the most eagerly-awaited motion 
pictures of the summer, "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. " 

Kevin Costner has made it big in 
Hollywood. Pretty good for a guy 
whose first role in "111e Big Chill" 
ended up on the cutting room floor. 
And now with Costner' UCCesS at 
the Academy A\o\ards, this story of 
tite "Prince of Thieves" is the mo t 
eagerly-awaited motion picture of 
the summer. 

But the inexpeJience of MOITissey's 
bandmernberscamc through vividly dur-
ing his ~ped-up cover of The Jam ' s 
"That' ~ Entt: J1ainmenl." The barricade 
holding bacl.. the crowu br kc, and peo-

rissey ~ topped si nging. and attempted to 
gel hi, guitari"t to ~ top playing. He actu-
ally went over to hi, lead guitari~t and 
muted hi, , tring'. The guitari,t ripped hi, 
guitar aw.IY from Morri"cy and began 

keting dream of the 1990s- what 
"Batman" was to the latter half of 
the Eighties. Based on the Dave 
Stevens' comic book series (No, 
we've never heard of it before thi , 
ei ther!) the film promises to be a 
"Raiders of the Lost Ark" with jets. 
It's also in the sa fe hands of director 
Joe Johnston ("Honey, 1 Shrunk the 
Kids"), who e previous film gros':;ed 
over $130 million. 

WithJeffrey KUlZenburg, the big-
mouse at Disney, making thi s film 
the exception to his new economy 
drive at the studios, "The Rock-
eteer" is thi s year's $40 million SLJ -
per-hero flick . 111eonlyquestion i , 
can it stand up to an opening date a 
week after "Robin Hood : Prince of 
Thieves" and the same day as Julia 
Robens' "Dying Young?" 

"Dying Young" 
tarringjulia Roberts, Campbell 
COli, Vi ncent D'Onofrio 

Directed by Joel chumacher 
Opening june 21 

Hilary 0' eil (Jul ia Robens) is 
an outgoing woman trapped in a 
mundane existence who finds com-
panion hip and love with Victor 
(Campbell Scott), a wealthy Plan 
dying of leukemia. Aware of the 
impossibility of their relationship, 

RAISINS 
FLOJOS 

Victor urges her, <i la "Lady 
Chatterley'S Lover," to make local 
stud D'Onofrio her main squeeze. 

There has been as much secrecy 
around this film as there was around 
the conclusion of Operation Desert 
Storm. 

But when you have the hone t 
fema le property in Hollywood 
starring in the film Premiere 
magazine nominated as the one to 
beat this ummer, you don 't give 
much away. 

The release date for "Dying 
Young" was only set ten days ago 
by Twenrieth Century Fox, and only 
:l two-page advertisement in theLA. 
Times has confirmed that the film 
wi ll be called "Dying Young." 

Studio bosses considered 
choosin;; a title completely oppo-
siteinmeaning- "ForeverYoung" 
- lest cinema goers get the impres-
sion that it is the Pretty Woman who 
pu he up the daisies. 

Roberts is reunited here with her 
"Aatliners" director and the film 
mark her last appearance before 
Steven Spielberg' "Hook" th is 
Chri tmas. 

After that, she and Kiefer are off 
to reproduce and no doubt to Ii ve on 
all the cash that thi s weepy is goi ng 
to produce.

Opening by june 7 

Three New York friend leave 
the Big Apple in.ln attempt to find 
themselves and the truth about li~ 
and love on a modem-day callie 
drive throught the American South-
west. The audience i given the op-
portunity to witn~~s a mid-life crisis 
amongst a herd of smelly animals. 

Billy Crystal retums to the screen 
fOrlhe fi rst ti me " nee "When Harry 
Met Sally ... " in a ti lm that shows 
what the Marlboro man really goes 
through. A superb supporting cast 
compliment th bclas ycomedy-
which is one of the few comedies 
which will be appearing thi s um-
mer. The film 'sonly competition is 
Harri on Ford'~ movie of the Sanle 
name, "City Slden,:' which is a 
film for the thi nY~1llething genera-
tion. 

The director of photography 
previou Iy hot the now-famous 
buffalo sequence of "Dances With 
Wolve" and hi~ mentor Kevin 
Costner is opening his new film a 
week later. It remains to be seen if 

"City Slickers" has the ability to not 
just to disappear without a trace. 

"Life Stinks" 
Starring Mel Brooks, Lesley Ann 
Warren, jeffery Tambor, Howard 
Morris 
Directed by Mel Brooks 
Opening july 12 

After a several year ab ence from 
the silver screen, Mel Brooks re-
turns to the one thing that made him 
a master of his element - of being 
a writer, director, producer, and ac-
tor. 

In hi new film, Brooks plays a 
greedy and arrogant billionaire who 
places a bet with his arch -rival that 
he can survive 30 days in the slums 
without money, connections or 
identity. 

Giving him support is Lesley Ann 
Warren as a bag lady who saves 
Brooks' life, 4I1d wins his hem. 

Mel Brooks' fi lms have aged well 
and are now considered classics by 
all who have survived their teens . 

The question now is whether or 
not he will be able to win over the 
hearts of those who thinlc "Silent 
Movie" is one of those ancient black-
and-white films or "High Anxiety" 
is a disease. The answer wili be 
found at the box office. 

For some reason, the Robin Hood 
saga is back in fashion thi s summer. 
There were three projects in the 
works, one was released on the FOX 
network, and another was scrapped. 
This one should prove to be a smash. 
lfnot, at least its previews look good. 

"Terminator II: 
Judgement Day" 

Starring Arnold chwarzeneggcr, 
Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong 
Directed by james Cameron 
Opening July 3 

"I'll beback . . . "and heis. Arnold 
SchwarzeAegger. who as a cyborg, 
went on a killing pree in Los Ange-
les, and was destroyed at the end of 
"The Terminator," has regenerated 
himself. 

But this time he' a good guy as 
he protects l ohn Connor (played by 
Edward Furlong), the leader of the 
humans in the future world and the 
son of the woman Schwanenegger 
was originally programmed to ter-
minate. 

Though thi s film has not yet 
opened, it has already et a record in 
the film industry as having the larg-
est price tag of any film- in the 
neighborhood of $85- 100 million. 

This can make thi tihn either the most 
uccessful gamble, or the biggest flop in 

hi story. 
Either way, the real question is wether 

a "Terminator 111"' will be made and re-
leased on August 29, 1997, the day that 
John Connor will ~uppo~edly to lead the 
battle against the machines. 

"Bill and Ted's 
Bogu Journey" 

Starring Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, 
George Carlin 
Directed by Peter Hewitt 
Opening july 19 

When we Ia.-.t lefl Bill and Ted. we 
thought that with thei r A+'s on thei r telm 
projects, the future of the world was in safe 
hands. 

smashing it on the tloor a la Pete 
Townsend . Morrbey walked off 

the stage in rt:spon~c. 
Oh. San Diego. ,.,0 much to 

answer for. Perhap' tht: most 
~ymbolic momcnt of thi, 
strJnge night came with Mor-
rissey's choice for his final 
song. It wa~n't very hard to 

~ee that he really was "Truly 
Disappointed. " 

!-Iowever, thi ~ is not to be the cmoe a~ 
some totally ev il dude wants to deMroy this 
future peace by erasing the ex istence of Bill 
and Ted. Kind of reeks of ' 'The TemlinalOr." 
doesn' t it? 

To help with his plans, the evil dude 
creates an evil robotic pair of our heroic 
dudes, resulting in Bi II and Ted's adventu re~ 
through hell , heaven, and beyond. 

Though "Bill and Ted's Excellent Ad-
venture" has gained cult-classic statu. the 
makers of the film weren't completely 
pleased with the end re~ults . They thought it 
could have been better. 

This time, they think they have\omething 
more along the lines of the original concept. 
Which leaves us to wonder that if thi s one is 
successful , can we expect a "Bill and Ted',

NCAA Division III women's ba -
kelball tournament. 

The NCAA selection commit-
tee announced in late February that 
only the top four teams in each of 
thee:ght regions would advance to 
the 32-team tournament. UCSD 
just missed the se lection by fini h-
ing fifth in the West Region. Prior 
to the selection committee' deci-
ion I UCSD Head Coach Judy 

Malone had thought that the Tri-
tons would make the tournament. 
The selection committee had set a 
precedent the year before when the 
top five seeded team in the West 
were chosen, But 1990-91 was a 
different year, and il had a differ-
ent ending. Despitethis bitter year-
end pill, the Tritons toppled school 
records for best eason record and 
most consecutive wins - previ-
ously 19·6 and nine, respectively. 

Muchof this year's success was 
due to a revived empha is on de-
fense - an emphasis that came in 
part with the addi tion of Jim 
Mottershaw to the program as an 
ass istant coach. Malone had 

worked with Mouershaw at camp 
and had been impres ed at his abil-
ity to "a1ways take the smal lest 
kids in camp and tum them into 
scrappy players and winners," 

When she heard he was avail-
able, she offered him the position 
at UCSD. Mottershaw's coaching 
style contrasted Malone' and 
added a much-needed balance to 
the Triton s. Forward Molly 
Jonnum, a junionransfer who came 
to the program with a reputation a 
a three-point pecialist but ended 
up as the team' s defensive topper, 
aid during the season: "When our 

offen e trugg les. our defense can 
pick us up and carry us to a win." 
Isn' t that the truth . 

On more than one occasion, the 
Tritons' tough defense held down 
their opponent and made it pos-
ible for the offense to cometo life. 

Early in the I -game win streak, 
UCSD avenged an early season 
31-point loss to crosstown rival 
Point Lorna by defeating the Cru· 
aders 61-55 . 

Unlike the first meeting of the 
year, UCSD stayed close to the 
Crusaders throughout the game and 
pulled ahead in Ihe final minute 

The UCSD Guardian 

when junior Carl Young scored 
and drew a foul. The subsequent 
free throw put U CS D ahead by one 
point with three minutes left on the 
clock. and the Tritons went on to 
victory. 

The win streak began with a 73-
70 victory over Nazareth College 
in early January. The Tritons would 
lose only one game the remainder 
of the year, but it was the one that 
counted - the hean-breaking 73-
63 10 to CCI that ended the Tri-
tons' season. UCSD stnned the 
game Irong, taking a 19·11 lead 
early in the game, and it looked 
like it wa well on its way to ils 
161h straight win. But the Eagles 
had something else in mind . 

Six succes ful ,hree-pointers led 
the Eagles on an offensive thrust 
that put CCI ahead for good, 

Kathleen Alvarez was named 
the team' Most Valuable Player. 
while Young wa named Be t Of· 
fensive Player, and Jonnum the 
Best Defensive Player. The Most 
Improved Playe r was Lisa Beaver. 
and the Most Inspirational was 
Emily Rubin.

UCSD ATHLETICS RECOGNmON NIGHT 
ATTHE LA JOLLA MARRlor 

. Den Me Do_III Guardian 

Quigley Emerges as Big Winner 
• Senior All-American 
named Alumni Senior 
Award winner, Hanes 
Woman of the Year, 
and one of 12 Athletes 
of the Year 
By Ken Perlman 
Staff Writer 

It was a night. as UCSD Ath-
letic Director Judy Sweet said. " to 
reflect on the accomplishments of 
thepastycarand lo re ognizetho e 
who have contributed to tho'~ ac-
complishments." 11 was a night to 
ay good-bye to UCSD'soutstand-

ing enior athletes. 
And it was a night to remember 

Ihe thrill of victory, Ihe agony of 
defeat, and the pirit of competi-
tion . 

Thursday evening. the UCSD 
Athletic Department held the 2nd 
Annual U San Diego Athletics 
Recognition Night at the La Jo\la 
Marriot. 

Among the highlights of the 
night were the recognition of two 
Alumni Senior Award winners, 12 
Athletes of the Year, and the first 
annual Hanes Woman of the Year. 

UCSD totaled 41 Ali-Ameri-
cans, as well as four Academic 
All-Americans in the 1990-1991 
season. 

Vice Chancellor for Under-
graduate Affairs Joe Watson 
opened the ceremonie by con-
gratulating UCSD's athletes for 
their outstanding individual and 
team accomplishments. 

" I hope that for each of you 
throughout all of your future years, 
that the competition andchalJenges 
you experienced this year and lhe 
friendships you have developed 
with your teammates will always 
be one of the most memorable and 
enjoyable aspects of your time at 
UCSD," Watson said. 

Sweel continued the ceremo-
nies by recognizing Ion Hammer-
meister, a graduate of UCSD and 
Head Coach of the UCSD men's 
tennis team for the past five sea-
sons. Hammenneister will be leav-
ing the university next year to con-
tinue his graduate studies. 

While at UCSD, he compiled a 
career coaching record of 73-60, 
and holds the record for the most 
winseverbya UCSDmen' tenni 
coach. 

In addition, Sweet recognized 

Dan McDo_IVGuardian 
Christy Parker was named one 
of 12 Athletes of the Year. 
the head coach of the UCSD 
women's tennis team, Liz La-
Plante, who was honored as the 
NCAA women's tennis Coach of 
the Decade at this year's national 
champion hips in Atlanta. Sweet 
also recognized women' volley-
ball Head Coach Dou'g Dannevik 
and men's basketball Head Coach 
Tom Marshall for being named 
1990-1991 NCAA Division m 
coaches of the year in their respec-
tive sports. 

The night also featured the in-
troduction of the Hanes NCAA 
Woman ofthe Year award, which 
comes in the wake of the 10th 
anniversary of women 's athletic 
in the NCAA. 

Each NCAA institution, Sweet 
said, is given the opportunity to 
take part in the awards process, 
and selects its own Woman of the 
Year. From those winners, 52 state 
winners (including Puerto Rico and 
the District of Colombia) will be 
selected and Hanes will donate 
$5,000 to each of the women's 
athletics programs. 

From those 52 winners, 10 fi-
nalists will be named, and from 
those, a single national winner will 
be chosen. $ IO,OOO will be do-
nated to the women's athletic pro-
gram of the final winner's school, 
and $5,000 to the schools of the 
other nine finalists. 

According to Sweet, the award 
i based on the criteria of "athletic 
excellence, academic achievement, 
and service and leadership." 

Sweet then recognized enior 
Shannon Quigley from the 
women' track and field team as 
this year' winner. 

UCSD graduate and Alumni 

Association President Gary 
Wollberg presented this year 's 
Alumni Senior Awards. The Asso-
ciation named swimmer Peter 
Smith as lhe first of thi year' 
winners. Smith was the captain of 
the UCSD swim team for the past 
two sea ons. 

Wollberg also named Quigley 
as the second of thi year ' win-
ners. 

Qui gley's honors range from 
being a seven-time All-Ame ri can 
to qualifying for the CAA Na-
lionaJ Championships in both the 
hot put and diSCUS events in three 

of her four years at UCSD, to win-
ning the national championship in 
both the shot put and discus in her 
junior year. 

Sweet presented the final 
awards of the evening to the 1990-
1991 UCSD Athlete of the Year. 
Twelve Triton athletes received 
the honor: 

ChristyParker-Parkerwa a 
member of both the women 's swim 
team, placing third in the 50-yard 
freestyle and sixth in the 1000yard 
butterfly, and the national cham-
pion women's water polo team. 
She was named an All-American 
in both sports. 

Travis Miller- Miller wasjust 
the third Triton ever to be recog-
nized as an Athlete of the Year in 
his freshman eason. As a member 
of the men's swim team, Miller 
won both the loo-yard and 200-
yard back and earned All-Ameri -
can statu in seven events. 

Jamie Dailey- Dailey, a mem-
ber of this year's national cham-
pion women's water polo team, 
was a leading goal scorer for the 
Tritons in the three-day national 
championship tournament held at 
UCSD in May. 

Brian Siljander - Siljander, 
the goalie for this year's UCSD 
men 's soccer team, allowed just 
nine goals during the 1990 season, 
posting 14 shutouts for the Tritons 
in 21 games. 

CafherineCapriies-Capriles, 
a member of this year's women 's 
wim tearn won Ihe 100 and 200 

back at this year's NCA,\ swim-
ming championship , and finished 
her UCSD career with ix indi-
vidual championships.

76-72 over Claremont, only to fall 
in the round of 16 at Otterbein 
University. 108-95.11 wa the far-
the t a UCSD squad has ever ad-
vanced in the CAA . 

The year's true highlight may 
have been the March 2 NCAA 
tournament win over Claremont, 
as the Triton proved that they 
weren't a one-man team that was 
merely average without leading 
. corer and most valuable player 
Tim Rapp. 

Rapp left the game early in the 
second half with a seve re ankle 

~prain and, for a few brief mo-
ments. it seemed as if the T ri ton, . 
hopes of cont in uing onward in the 

CAA tournament had gone down 
with him. 

But UCSD re ponded well to 
thei r adversity. as junior poim 
guard Darvinlackson , the Tritons' 
defen i ve player of the year, led a 
pirited comeback. coring 13 

points as the Tritons squeaked out 
the win. 

In the next round. the Tritons 
had to travel to Otterbein, and 
played like they had a bad case of 

SWIM 
Continued from page 24 

Ignore the fact that Kenyon ran 
away with the meet, accumulating 
an unbelievable 303 points more 
than its closest competitor. 

For UCSD, the star of the meet 
was unquestionably fre shman 
Travis Miller. In his first national 
meet, Miller won the 100 back in a 
time of 51.41. His time was just 
one-tenth of a second off the Divi-
sion ill record. 

He also won the 200 back, and 
added a second-place funsh and 
three top-four finishes on relay 
teams en route to becoming a scven-
time All-American. As impressive 
as Miller's accomplishments were, 
perhaps even more notable was the 
perfonnance by a pair of UCSD 
relay teams. 

The 800-yard freestyle relay 
team - Catherine Cap riles, 
Sabrina Lum, Jocelyn Rothbard, 
andlennaBanaszek-becamethe 
first women's team to beat Kenyon 
in a relay since 1985. 

Apparently, 800 was a magic 
number for UCSD, as the men also 
beat the Lords in the 800-yard 
freestyle relay. The Tritons placed 
second behind Hope. Kenyon 
placed third -the first time it has 
ever lost a men's relay at the na-
tional championships. 

The Triton women were led by 
Capriles, who continued her Divi-
sion ill mastery of the lOO-yard 
and 200-yard backstroke. Two 
years ago, Capriles set NCAA Di-
vision ill records in the two events, 
as well as the 200 1M en route to 
Swimmer of the Meet honors. This 
year she claimed her second con-
secutive titles in the 100 and 200 
back. They were her fifth and sixth 
titles as a Triton. 

Other notable performances 
were tumed in by sprinter Jamee 
Couch, who broke the school record 
in the 50 free, and Sabrina Lum 
and Erin Bakey, who broke two 
school records apiece. In the pro-
cess, Lum won two individual titles. 

On the men' side. lohn Flow-
ers finished third in the 100 free, 
and Mark Fahlen placed fourth in 
the 500 free and fifth in the 1650 
free. Rothbard and Fahlen were 
named the team 's Swimmers of 
the Year.

UCSD seemed to be a step slow, 
Otterbein was sinking practically 
everything it shol - from 35-foot 
rainbows to five-foot layup - in 
the first half, and its swann ing de-
fense forced the Tritons into nu-
merous early turnovers . The Car-
dinals' chances probably weren't 
hurt by the fact that the game wa 

being played in front of 3. 16 1

Jarrell Time 
By Gregg Wfenn 
Staff Writer 

M EussA JARRELLwill still be the head coach of the UCS D softball 
team next year. That may not 
sound like big news, but when 
coaches have been shuttling in 
and out ofthedriver's seat faster 
than a Japane e bullet train -
10 in the past 14 years - it's 
someth ing worth noting. 

Jarrell, who led the Tritons 
to a 2 1-22 record and a trip to 
Pella. Iowa for the NCAA 
regionals th is year, will be re-
turning with enthusiasm. " I can 
start building my own learn 
now, implement my ideas of 
what it should be like and hope-
fully succeed wi th them," she 
aid. 

The Triton head coach spent 
the previou three years as an 
as istant at Trenton Stale in New 
Jersey while she worked on a 
Illa ter' s degree. A graduate of 
the Universi ty of ol1h Caro-
lina. Jarrell, as selected as the 
Tritons' coach following a na-
tional searc h conducted by the 
Athletic Depanment. 

During her tay at Trenton 
State. Jarrell helped the team to 
win the NCAA Divi~ion III na-
tional champion hip in 1989. 
But not even the experience of 
winning a champio nship could 
prepare her for a head coaching 
job. " I didn't realize how much 
work was involved in being a 
head coach. It can be hard to 
deal with 16 different person-
alities all at the ame time." 

Having survived her tir t 
year relatively unscathed,Jarrell 
is clearly optimistic. But she is 
al 0 realistic about the chal-
lenges facing herteam next year. 

"We los t s ix people - our 
entire infield - to graduation. 
o next season will definite ly 

be a rebuilding year: ' she said. 
To keep the program fo-

cu ed, Jarrell has et several 
goals - both for next season 
and for the next few years . 

"We should be better than 
.500 next year," he aid. " In 
fac t, there's no reason why we 
can' t win 2S game. There's no 
doubt in my mind that we can 
hoot for regionals every year. 

We need to stan shaping the 
team and making it into a seri-
ous program." 

One of the biggest obstacles 

Melissa Jarrell has 
already succeeded where 

others have failed by 
returning as the head 

coach for UCSD softball. 
Now she has a chance to 

rebuild the program. 

Jarrell has encountered while re-
building the program is recruiting. 

A a Division HI team, Jarrell 
has nothing to offer possible re-
cruits except the program it elf. 
Couple that with tough acade mic 
requirement • and you understand 
why recruiting is Jarre))' s biggest 
headache. 

"I've got a couple of recrui ts 
coming in, but it still could be 
something of a truggle to ti II all of 
the holes," she said. 

Jarrell said he i n't sure about 
a po. sible UCSD muve to the 
Divi on II level - ~hich offers 
scholarships. "Division II would 
make recruiting easier. but it would 
al 0 make schedul ing a lot easier. 
Righ t now we play good Division 
II teams. but moving up would 
make it impler. However, if stay -
ing at Division IJl is what's best for 

the entire athletic program. then 
it should stay that way:' she 
aid. 

Regardle s of the competi- ' 
tion. Jarrell is sure about at 
least one thing - next year's 
team will be securely anc hored 
in her system. After giving this 
year's team a chan e to get 
used to her s tyle , Jarrell will be 
counting on this year's juniors 
- outfielders Lisa Mora and 
Cindi Murphy. and econd-
team All-American pitcher 
Dianna Moreno - to keep the 
team I,,, dv:\ ted and to help 
teach the younger players. "I 
know that it' hard to adjust to 
a new coach every year. For the 
eniors, l was their foul1h coach 

here. But if I can be he re a few 
years, that won ' t be a distrac-
tion," she said. 

Despite the prospect of a 
rebuilding year, Jarrell said that 
the team will stick to its tough 
schedule. which included 15 
games against Division II op-
ponents and seven against Di-
vis ion I teams. 

With her first season behind 
her, Jarrell is clearly enthusias-
tic about the challenge of mold-
ing a champion: "I want to be 
here a few years. After all. we 
can only go up." 

Despite being an assistant coach for the 1989 Trenton State 
team that won the national championship, Jarrell was 
unprepared for the added pressures of being a head coach.

UCSD Takes Next Step 
Forward 
A lineup that returned all five 
starters from the year before 
lifted men's basketball to the 
mo t succe ful eason in the 
program hi tory. 
By Les Bruvold 
Associate Sports Editor 

For the CSD men' ~ ba ketball team, the 
1990-9 1 season pr ved to be just hon of 
incredible. But if you really think about it, the 
Triton '~uccess 'houldn' t have be '11 that much 
of a surpri e. 

The Tri ton returned five tnner from a 
1989-90 squad that went 20-7 and made it to the 
NCAA tournament for the first time ever, only 
to 10 e at Nebraska-We 'Ieyan in the first round 
77-75. 

After that game, fNward Gordon Mc eill 
aid: "We're a team to watch out for Inext yearl. 

We want10 win it all. We won't settle for JUS! 
getting into the playoff ." 

On the whole, McNeill 's pr dictions proved 
to be fairly accurate. but he was wrong about 
one thing - the Tritons didn ' t manage to wi n it 
all. But then you can 'r be right about every-
th ing. 

As we look ba k at the Tritons ' 1990-9 1 
hardcoun exploi ts. there was a veri table litany 
of record-sett ing performances. 

Number One: UCSD finished the regular 
eason at 22-3, piling up the mo t win ever by 

a Triton basketball quad. 
Number Two : The Tri ton fini~hed the year 

ranked fourth in Division rn by the CAA. the 
highest ranking UCSD ha ever achieved. 

Number Three: UCSD went undefeated ( 17-
0) in the regular sea on against Divi ion III 
opposition, including an impre ive 97-86 
overtime victory at highly-regarded Claremont.

The Tritolls lift poim guard Dan'in Jackson ill 
the air ill celebration of the team's second-
rOlilld will over Claremont ill the NCAA Divi-
siollIII mell's basketball tOlimamelll. 

Number FOllr: The Tri ton closed out the 
year wi th a chool-record 14 consecutive Wi llS, 
outscoring their opponents by an average of 18 
points per game over the period. 

Nlimber Fil'e (and perhaps most importulIf): 
UC D made it to the NCAA Divi ion 1lI men 's

winning a hard-fought second-round home game

Taking a Back Seat to the Lords 
The UCSD swim teams 
finished behind perennial 
nemesis Kenyon once again. 
By Peter Ko 
Sports Editor 

If you know anything about the hi tory of the 
UCSD swim team , then you know where this is 
headed. 

Every year around this time, we stan to write 
about the illustrious wimming program at 
Kenyon College in Ohio. We write about how the 
women have been the national champions ince 
1983, and the men ince 1979. We write about the 
Lords' countle s record-setting performance (thi 
year the Kenyon women set a meet record for 
team point ). And we write about how the UCSD 
swim team finished behind Kenyon - again. 

But this year, it' s going to be different. Maybe it 's 
time to start appreciating a women' program that 
fini shed just 63 
points behind the 
Lord two years 
ago, and placed 
second again this 
year, breaking 11 
chool records in the process. 

Maybe it's time to stan appreciating a 
men's program that set a school record for 
points at the national meet two years ago, 
and finished third this year, a mere nine 
points behind runner-up Claremont.

The UCSD women'S ba~ketballteam
