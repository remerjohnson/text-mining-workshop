Valentine’s Day beachgoers dis-
covered the body of a young Asian 
woman on the cliffs overlooking 
Black’s Beach just after noon on 
Sunday, Feb. 14.

Passersby reported the body to 
lifeguards, who called a helicopter to 
the scene. The paramedic from the 
helicopter found the body already 
entering rigor mortis — the stage in 
which the body becomes stiff, about 
three hours after death  — indicating 
she had been there for some time. 

The body was spotted on the side 
of the cliffs, just below Gliderport. The 
woman, reported by officers to be 18 
years old and from Milbrae, Calif., has 
yet to be publicly identified.

She was found near a flashlight 
and backpack, which police officers 
said leads them to assume she was 
trying to reach the beach at night, 
via the Torrey Pines Gliderport Trail. 
According to San Diego Lifeguard Lt. 
Andy Lerum, the area sees an esti-
mated 50 cliff rescues a year.

The body was covered in bruises 
and showed signs of blunt-force trau-
ma, though the San Diego Medical 
Examiner’s Office has not released a 
formal cause of death. The San Diego 
Police Department currently assumes 
the woman’s fall was an accident.

“She fell off the cliffs — if it’s an 
accident, it’s not a criminal nature,” a 
dispatch representative for the SDPD 
said. “So it’s being handled by the 
coroner’s office. For now, that’s all we 
have to go on.”

Anyone with information is 
encouraged to contact the SDPD.

The Student Wellness Department 
is looking to take last spring’s tight-
ened smoking policy one step further 
by enacting a complete smoking ban 
on campus.

Last week, the Committee on 
Policies was formed to re-evaluate all 
campus health policies. According to 
A.S. Vice President of Student Life and 
member of the student advisory board 
to Student Wellness Ricsie Hernandez, 
the smoking policy is of particular con-

cern, because current regulations —
which prohibit smoking within 25 feet 
of any building — are often violated. 

Marshall College junior Connie 
Yang agreed that the current smoking 
policy is rarely enforced.

“I don’t think students generally 
follow the policy,” Yang said. “I smell 
[cigarette smoke] everywhere, espe-
cially near the Geisel entrance.”

The university operates under the 
Smoke-Free Policy, which was instated 
in 1994 and applies to all UCSD facili-
ties, owned or leased, regardless of 
location. The original policy prohibit-

ed  smoking indoors, as well as within 
five feet of the main entrance or exit of 
any facility. 

Those regulations were tightened 
last year. In Spring Quarter 2009, the 
ban on smoking extended from within 
five feet of any facility to within 25 feet.

According to Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Student Wellness Karen 
Calfas, a complete ban of smoking 
on campus is not a new idea.  In Fall 
Quarter 2009, the UCSD Health 
Sciences campuses experimented with

In an effort to maintain opera-
tions at the Price Center and the 
Student Center, the University 

Centers Advisory Board has estab-
lished a prospective referendum for 
the 2010 Spring Ballot — a proposal 
that would increase student fees each 
year to match statewide inflation.

The referendum, which will 
be discussed and voted on at this 
Wednesday’s A.S. Council meeting, 
would base its annual fee on changes 
in the Consumer Price Index. The 
CPI measures inflation by calculating 
the change in price of various goods 

and services as time progresses. As 
inflation increases, the amount of 
goods or services a single dollar can 
purchase decreases, so businesses pay 
more for the same level of operation 
and maintenance costs. 

Currently, students pay $76.50 
per quarter to fund $6 million of 
University Centers’ $11 million bud-
get — a number that hasn’t changed 
since its Price Center East expansion 
in 2003. Should this referendum pass, 

it would fund the cost of inflation that 
University Centers faces year after 
year by compensating for that differ-
ence, beginning Fall Quarter 2011.

“While [Price Center’s] enterprise 
income increases for inflation, the 
contribution from the student fee cur-
rently does not,” A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta said. “We would want the fee to 
reflect inflation, so the building could

The University Centers 
Referendum would up its 
fee, then adjust annually 
to account for inflation.

POORLY DRAWN LINES By Reza Farazmand

do two things: stay in the black, and 
also build up as a reserve over time.”

UCAB drew up the 
proposal for the refer-
endum this year due to 
the stagnation of stu-
dent enrollment.

“We didn’t need it 
before, because enroll-
ment has been growing 
pretty steadily over the 
past 10 years,” Taylor 
said. “So every time we 
get fresh new enroll-
ment, the fee stayed the 
same, but the amount 
of fees we’re collecting 
essentially grows, so 
income grows. This has 
helped us operate and 
maintain the building 
without forcing us to rely on some-
thing like a CPI.”

Taylor said that other student fees 
account for inflation, and UCAB is 
attempting to do the same.

The referendum also prohibits 
UCAB from making any decision that 
would put University Centers in opera-

tional debt, meanwhile preserving the 
amount of student fees paying off Price 
Center’s construction.

When Price Center 
decided to expand, it 
planned to pay with a refer-
endum that dedicated $6.80 
per-student per-quarter 
toward the debt accrued 
during the construction of 
Price Center West, and $36 
toward the construction of 
Price Center East.

The new proposal 
would not affect either por-
tion. Instead, only the other 
half of the current $76.50 
University Centers fee — 
which finances operational 
costs in Price Center and 
the Student Center like 
building maintenance, cus-

todial services and marketing — would 
be affected by changes in the CPI.

Once the debt is paid off, that por-
tion of the fee — which totals $42.80 
— would no longer be collected. But 
according to Gupta, the debt will not 
be fully repaid for “tens of years.”

If the referendum doesn’t pass, 

University Centers will still require 
additional funds to keep its facilities 
open, and will likely request addi-
tional student fees every year until a 
referendum passes, Gupta said.

“Even with operational changes, 
they just don’t have enough revenue 
coming in for everything they have 
to do,” Gupta said. “If it doesn’t go 
through this quarter, they’ll probably 
eat at their reserves throughout the 
next year, and then ask A.S. again… It’s 
kind of a fiscal reality.”

The referendum language also stip-
ulates that UCAB would be the offi-
cial University Centers Board, giving 
it direct oversight over the centers, in 
place of its current advisory capacity.

When University Centers was 
founded in the 1980s, the University 
Centers Board — composed of stu-
dents — had the final say in decisions 
regarding the center, and a director 
carried out its initiatives. However, 
according to Gupta, the structure was 
changed over a decade ago by univer-
sity administration, making the board 
advisory and handing off the decision-
making power to Student Life admin-
istrators. The referendum, if passed, 

would call for a reversal of this change.
“When we’re dealing with a facil-

ity that’s funded in large part through 
student fees, it should be students who 
are making the decisions,” Gupta said.

a one-year pilot policy that created a 
blanket ban on smoking at the UCSD 
Medical Center, Skaggs and other 
nearby facilities. For a smoother tran-
sition, the policy designated outdoor 
smoking areas for the first six months.

However, Calfas said it is unlikely 
the main UCSD campus will adopt the 
same policy anytime soon, as it is too 
extreme to be widely implemented.

“A completely smoke-free campus 
would be completely difficult and not 
realistic,” Calfas said.

She said the committee will instead 
make its immediate focus the enforce-
ment of the current 25-foot ban, then 
evaluate results after a year’s time.

The committee plans to issue a 
survey gathering student, faculty and 
staff opinions on regarding on-campus 
tobacco use by next quarter. It will then 
pass an amended draft of the policy to 
the Office of the Chancellor.

Hernandez brought up the issue 
at the A.S. Council meeting last 
Wednesday to gauge student represen-
tatives’ position on the topic. She said 
the council suggested Student Wellness 
more widely publicize the 25-foot rule 
before enacting a complete ban.

“This is a dominant issue on cam-
pus, and continues to get brought 
up a lot,” Hernandez said. “For the 
most part, A.S. felt that before any 
strict action of strict ban to happen, 
the 25-foot smoking rule should be 
enforced.”

The student advisory board has 
discussed several methods of gauging 
campuswide opinion, including online 
surveys, soliciting to various organiza-
tions or creating focus groups. Surveys 
would be issued this Spring Quarter.

In an inter-
view with the 
Guardian, A.S. 
Council Transfer 
Senator Adam 
Powers (one 
of two under-
graduates on 
the Parking and 
Transportation 
Committee) 

and Parking and Transportation 
Services Director Brian d’Autremont 
discussed the Transportation 
Referendum, a proposed student fee 
that recently failed to be voted onto 
the Spring Quarter ballot. 

Last Fall Quarter, d’Autremont 
approached the A.S. Council for funds, 
urgently asking for a referendum to 
bail out the Parking and Transportation 
Services. According to d’Autremont, 
the department desperately needs 
student funds — or else access to 
public transit and campus shuttles 
face drastic cuts for the coming year.

But despite the threat of a more 
cramped ride to school, the A.S. 
Council overwhelmingly voted against 
putting the Parking and Transportation 
Referendum on 
the spring ballot 
last Wednesday. 
Here, a student 
and administra-
tor hash out the

TRANSPORTATION REFERENDUM

Guardian: Adam, could you explain why the coun-
cil didn’t think it wise to place the Transportation 
Referendum on the Spring Quarter ballot?
Adam Powers: I think you answered the question a 
bit with your own question. We didn’t feel that the $25 
per quarter was necessary, considering the research 
we’ve done on it … It would be the first time that the 
money from a referendum would be going outside the 
purview of student life, and we didn’t want to set that 
precedent — at least not unless we thought it was nec-
essary. So, in lieu of passing the referendum or putting 
it on the ballot, we drafted a resolution to 
explore other options.
G: Brian, why do you think the referen-
dum ultimately failed?
Brian d’Autremont: You know, I really 
can’t say the internal politics of what was 
decided. I think, legitimately, students 
had concerns about the efficiency of how 
things are run. And it’s an extremely effi-
cient system, but unless you work with it 
every day, it’s hard to see that. 
G: I understand that one of the A.S. 
Council’s primary concerns was that 
your department hadn’t looked into 
enough alternative solutions, rather 
than going directly to the students to 
pay an additional $25 per quarter. Do 
you also feel that is true?
BD: Well, no. We’ve worked now for the 
last three years on trying to get to the 
root of this situation. We’ve tried to find 
out exactly what the causes were of our 
transportation’s dilemma … We have 
2,600 more people riding the bus than we had three 
or four years ago … It’s 100 gallons worth of diesel for 
each bus, every day. And so we’ve had costs, but it just 
exceeded our wildest imaginations.
G: Are you confident that the student body will see 
cuts for Fall Quarter 2010 in the transportation 
offerings?
BD: I think it’s very possible … From my point of 
view, the only thing I can do is either cut expenses or 
raise revenues. Three years ago, we had 52 buses oper-

ating on a daily basis. We now have 40 buses, but we 
haul 2,500 extra people a day … There’s just no way to 
keep up with the exploding demand for public trans-
portation. 
G: Why do you think the referendum failed?
AP: One of the reasons the referendum failed, and 
one of the many concerns behind it, is that the situ-
ation is almost presented as a ‘Here is the solution: 
referendum’ and ‘Here are the alternatives: cuts to 
things like employment and shuttles’ ... We didn’t feel 
that, in a lot of ways, it was fair to say, ‘Pass this refer-

endum,’ and without the additional money 
going into the system, these cuts are going 
to be made to services without significant 
student input. 
G: Do you think this would set a danger-
ous precedent and enable departments 
such as parking and transportation to 
come directly to the council and propose 
a referendum as sort of a bailout?
AP: I’m generally not big on slippery-slope 
arguments, in terms of ‘We must not do this 
because of these concrete concerns, because 
of this possibility further down the road,’ 
but it was one of the numerous concerns we 
had with it … We don’t see administrators 
as moustache-twirling villains, but at the 
same time, if you need money and you have 
services students need — and A.S. has, you 
know, the ability to write a referendum — 
we didn’t want to see those coming through 
the door. We’d rather those conversations 
take place at a higher level, saying, ‘Hey, 
why aren’t you getting adequate funding 

from the places where that funding is supposed to 
come from?’ instead of passing off more onto the stu-
dent body.
G: What do you think the next steps are for your 
department, now that this has recently failed?
BD: Well, the department is waiting on guidance and 
decisions to be made by the Transportation Policy 
Committee … There is roughly $3 million worth in

Las Vegas may be the epitome of American excess, but if you’re going to visit Sin City before 
you can order a straight whiskey with-
out being escorted out of the bar, you 
run the risk of leaving with your wal-
let embarrassingly full. How-to Guru 
has some well-tested tips for making 
the most of the experience (without 
wasting a night and a Benjamin on 
Cher’s 12th Farewell Tour). 

First and foremost, go with your 
cooler, old friends. The next best 
thing next to being 21 in Vegas is 
being around those who are. Don’t 
waste $200 on a fake ID with no 
magnetic strip; try to score an expired 
driver’s license from a friend who 

bears enough of a resemblance that 
the bouncer lets you in. (Girls, there’s 
no such thing as too much cleavage.) 
If you get your hands on an ID that 
says you’re 24, it’s a lot more legitimate 
when causally inspected among a sea 
of 20-somethings than a group of jit-
tery 18-year-olds. 

Even if you can’t get a fake in time, 
there’s no need to be stuck sipping Red 
Bull your entire stay. Instead, pitch in a 
little extra so your older friends return 
with plenty of cheap, efficient booze in 
tow. Get someone to take you under 
his or her wing: The gates will open, 
and the alcohol and opportunities will 
flood down your throat in no time.

Be ready (and excited) to blow 
cash on unneeded extravagances. The 
Vegas experience isn’t complete with-
out a depleted bank account and a 
consistently rising blood-alcohol con-
tent. Withdraw cash for all the places 
you don’t want your parents seeing on 
your bank statement, and expect to 
pay $15 for a strip club (plus a wad of 
singles to lure Kandi’s assets up close), 
$40 for an elk-and-ostrich buffet and 
$79 for that two-girl special. 

Of course, no Vegas trip is com-
plete without the ultimate casino sta-
ple: sketchy-ass old men. Don’t write 
them off completely — play your cards 
right and Hank from Reno just might 
buy you a bourbon. Ladies, a wink and 
a smile never hurt, but back away the 
moment that geezer starts to invade 
your space. Chastise him as you would 
a particularly horny dog; a bitchy 
“down boy” usually does the trick. 

A final piece of advice: Sleep 
when you’re dead. How-to Guru 
enjoys a nap as much as the next 
Adderall-fried student — just not in 
the flashiest city in the world. Let your 
hair down, because you’re not techni-
cally having fun unless brain cells 
are begging for better days of mere 
hyper-caffeination. You may have 
been out staving advances from gui-
dos geezers in the club since 11 p.m., 
but that’s no excuse to succumb to 
exhaustion before sunrise. Take slutty 
photos. Polish off half-empty bottles 
and warm fallen soldiers. Put “Bad 
Romance” on repeat ’til you’re face-
down on the carpet. Don’t worry, a 
couple efficient hours of shut-eye goes 
a long way — even if it is on a vomit 
covered bathroom floor at 8 a.m.. Lest 
you forget: This is Las Vegas. No mat-
ter your age, you go big or go home.

Dear Editor,
I am writing to express my disap-

pointment with today’s cover story on 
the Guardian. As the newspaper, which 
is said to represent “The Student Voice 
Since 1967,” the lack of journalistic 
integrity and bias that went into this 
article was simply outrageous. Instead 
of covering a major policymaker’s 
speech on campus, as your paper was 
supposed to do (the event which was 
put on by UCSD students), your article 
focused on the protest that went on 
once the event was concluded. There 
was not one picture of the ambassador, 
nor was there any mention of the chan-
cellor’s support and appearance at the 
event, nor the standing ovations that 
the ambassador was given. This event 
was the best thing to ever happen for 
the pro-Israel movement on campus 
(which is frequently under attack), and 
the event was a positive experience for 
all involved, including the anti-Israel 
people asking questions. 

However, you did not focus on 
the real story of the ambassador, and 
instead focused solely on the negative 
reactions outside by the protesters, 
including a man not from UCSD 
named Mahmoud, who you inter-
viewed. He had posted online anti-
Semitic statements, such as deliberately 
pointing out that Oren is a Jew, and 
frequently accused him of being a 
Zionist war criminal. He even com-
pared the state of Israel (the country 
which many of our students and facul-
ty call home) to the Nazi Third Reich. 
Your article completely revised the 
history of the event, and I am ashamed 
and angered that our school newspaper 
would report so unprofessionally.

Quick point of clarification: One, 

I’m actually the vice president of off-
campus outreach for Tritons for Israel, 
but any letter submitted to the editor is 
on behalf of the individual and not on 
behalf of Tritons for Israel, which does 
not take a stand on press articles. There 
were members of TFI who did not 
think the article was as outrageously 
unprofessional as I did, and then there 
were others who did feel it was.

— Sam Spector
Senior, Marshall College

Dear Editor,
I am an active member in Tritons 

for Israel. I saw today’s article and I 
think you should be ashamed as to 
how you portrayed the event.

First off, it was entitled “Israeli 
Visitor Draws Crowd.” Michael Oren 
is not an Israeli “visitor.” He is the 
ambassador to the U.S. from Israel, a 
country that supports freedom and 
democracy, condones terror and 
makes many positive contributions to 
the world in which we live.

The front cover of the Guardian 
should not be a picture of the com-
paratively small amount of protestors 
outside of our event, but a picture from 
the back of the auditorium showing 
Ambassador Oren speaking to the over 
400 people in attendance. Showing 
protestors on the front cover shows 
that the focus of the event was on the 
protestors, when in reality, the focus 
was on the ambassador. Oren gave a 
great speech with many anecdotes and 
facts about one of the strongest rela-
tionships: the U.S.-Israel relationship. 

There is also something noticeably 
wrong with the picture. You could 
call it a proportionality problem, but 
that would be “covering it up.” The 
Palestinian flag is way too big for the 
stick that holds it. Also, notice careful-
ly how you can see through the stick 
and see a sign behind it. All of the 

sticks that I’ve ever encountered aren’t 
transparent. Also, the flag covers the 
title of the newspaper, showing that 
the newspaper has a political agenda 
and does not support Israel’s rights.

Another problem with the 
front page is the caption “Agree to 
Disagree.” You cite that “Palestinian 
supporters clashed with Israeli student 
groups,” when there was no clash 
whatsoever. When the speech was 
over, the people who were quietly 
listening left. The protestors outside 
used their megaphones to make a 
whole lot of noise. I know that you 
write for a newspaper and are tempted 
to use powerful verbs, but the word 
“clashed” makes it sound like some-
thing actually happened. You yourself 
said that the protests “did not end in 
any arrests or major disruptions.”

Overall, the article you wrote 
was extremely misleading. It ties the 
Guardian to the pro-Palestinian side 
by covering the title of the newspaper 
with the flag and by the obvious photo 
editing used by the staff. You should 
also work on presenting first-person 
observation and not using quotes 
as evidence. Firsthand accounts are 
much more accurate than secondhand 
accounts on an issue. I hope you write 
in the similar style during Apartheid 
Week in early May, giving the pro-
Israel standpoint of the event.

In sum, you should be ashamed of 
yourselves. In my eyes, the Guardian 
has lost all credibility as an unbiased 
and respected newspaper. The focus 
of the article and pictures should have 
been on Israel’s ambassador, not the 
protest that followed.

— Steven Perlin
Freshman, Revelle College

Dear Editor,
Your coverage in the Guardian of 

the visit and speech by Michael Oren 

(Israeli Ambassador to the U.S.) was 
not only a disgrace to UCSD, but truly 
shows the anti-Israeli views that the 
Guardian writers hold. As a former stu-
dent and current employee of UCSD, I 
am ashamed of your focus on the nega-
tive aspects of the event and obvious 
bias in your reporting. The Guardian 
is not a tool for propaganda, or for 
furthering personal agendas. I am far 
from being a journalist or a writer, but 
I believe a 10-year-old could have done 
a better job at portraying the truth. I 
am deeply saddened by your decision 
to publish this joke of an article, and 
now hope that the Guardian team will 
take action to right this wrong.

— Alex Ghatan
Alumnus, UCSD

Dear Editor,
My friends and classmates were 

very disconcerted at the recent article 
on Michael Oren’s visit to UCSD. We 
felt that the article was heavily and 
unfairly biased and strongly misrep-
resented the details and purpose of 
the talk. While Tritons for Israel took 
every step to allow peaceful and free 
discussion, I feel this article posed a 
very one-sided and harsh opinion that 
marred the reputation of all organiza-
tions involved. It is for this reason that 
I kindly ask you to revoke that article.

cuts that needs to be made to make 
sure the budget is viable for the 
future.
G: So where do you expect those 
cuts to primarily come from?
BD: That I really can’t say, and I 
don’t vote on it. It’s a matter of stu-
dent, staff and faculty-chair gover-
nance picking which routes. 
G: OK, now Adam, as a council-
member, do you have any sort of 
expectations as far as what those 
cuts [might be]?
AP: We have preferences and sug-
gestions, and any person watching 
or reading can check out our legisla-
tion. A.S. can help you get a hold 
of it. The resolution that we passed, 
saying basically — we’re not outright 
saying we don’t want a referendum 

at all, we’re not ever saying, ‘Don’t 
come to the students for money.’ 
Just come to us when you literally 
have no other option. And there 
are the other options. We think that 
definitely it’s reasonable to say ‘OK, 
$300,000 to $400,000 is not going 
to get us out of the red, but it would 
possibly drop the need of the refer-
endum to, say, $25 to $20.’ And we 
think $5 is a big difference … We 
definitely want to try to bring down 
that dollar figure as much as possible 
before we bring it to students for a 
vote.

At least I, personally, vote that if 
anything, we would start to look at 
subsidies for MTS, because the truth 
is even if you cut 100-percent subsi-
dies of MTS — which we don’t want 

— guess what? MTS still comes to 
school. If you cut a blue-and-white 
shuttle, that shuttle is gone.
G: Any other final comments or 
concerns?
BD: Not really any comments or 
concerns, except to say that it’s 
important for everybody that’s rep-
resented to contact their member of 
the policy committee to make sure 
their voice is heard.
AP: I don’t want anyone to view this 
as an administration-versus-students 
issue. I think that the public-
transportation issue faces all of us. 
It’s something we all use to varying 
degrees, and varying degrees of reli-
ability … I think we just want to 
see the solution that helps as many 
people as possible.

The controversial Superbowl ad from Focus on the Family 
fades from a baby photo to a head-
shot of Pam Tebow (mother of 
2007 Heisman Trophy winner Tim 
Tebow), who — with a Botoxed 
smile — explains how she “almost 
lost” her son. The ad concludes 
with uplifting music and a senti-
mental scene of Tim hugging his 
mother, framed by “Pam and Tim 
Tebow — 2007 Heisman Trophy 
Winner.” 

Message: Don’t abort, because 
your uterus could be holding the 
next Heisman trophy winner.

But what the 30-second spot 
doesn’t tell us is that Tim wasn’t 
actually an unplanned pregnancy, 
nor the son of a teen mother: The 
doctors in the third-world country 
in which Tebow was conceived 
thought he was a tumor. Pam’s 
nurse advised her to “abort” the 
tumor, stressing that keeping it 
would put her life in danger. 

Just short of sounding like an 
ad for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, 
Tebow tries to pull the heart-strings 
of the football enthusiasts across 
the country. But did she really 
“almost lose” him? Nearly aborting 
a child — several times — does not 
equate to almost losing it.

Tebow said that if god asked her 
to give her life up, “he would take 
care of [her] family.” Pro-lifers are, 
of course, entitled to their views, 
but sharing only a misleading tid-
bit of Pam Tebow’s story does not 
promote the organization’s cause; it 
only leaves us furrowing our brows 
in confusion.

Strolling down Library Walk, it always burns a hole through my 
eyes to see pro-life demonstrators 
deck the walkways with photos of 
aborted fetuses. But blatant tasteless-
ness aside, the message is indeed clear 
and unavoidable — an eye-catching 
means of publicizing their cause. 

This time, though, the pro-life 
brigade didn’t make my stomach want 
to hurl its contents. The scripted dia-
logue from Tim Tebow’s mother about 
how lucky she is to have  kept her son 
was so vague, I was left wondering if 
she’d almost miscarried or if the meaty 
hulk was once a premee. 

But there’s a reason that we’re left 
scratching our heads after viewing 
the multi-million-dollar ad: Had Pam 
whipped out a dismembered fetus and 
scolded pro-choicers everywhere, we’d 
be less be willing to lend an ear to the 
Focus on the Family campaign. The 
shift from in-your-face pop-ups to fam-
ily-targeted sob stories is — though it 
may still strike the nerves of pro-choic-
ers — a clever marketing decision for 
the organization. Hey, if they can raise 
an eyebrow without turning a stomach, 
they must be doing something right.

   omewhere in 1983 Revelle College alumnus Joshua  
   Harris’ collection of life possessions exists a videotape 

              of himself taking a shit. 
                   Lucky for whoever’s currently bunking in Harris’ 
              second-floor Discovery Hall dorm room, the cam
              era that recorded the epic event wasn’t installed in his 

college digs. The footage was taken much later, in a typical moment 
of Harris’ life work: expensive surveillance projects that push pri-
vacy norms to the limit.

That’s not to say Harris didn’t get some practice in shock-value 
entertainment during his five years at UCSD. In Spring Quarter 
1981, he was disqualified from the A.S. presidential election for 
spending 93 cents over his $50 campaign budget. Additionally per-
turbed by then-Chancellor Richard Atkinson’s decision to sell the 
land between UCSD and Black’s Beach, Harris decided he’d exact 
revenge by founding fraternity Phi Delta Theta and a little publica-

tion known as the Koala.
“I got ripped off,” Harris said. “I was so 

pissed off, and I knew that Atkinson did 
not want fraternities on our campus. So 
I said ‘well, because he doesn’t want that, 
I’ll start one.’ And then, I made the first 
Koala. I got the money for it, and I got 
them the office space.”

Harris was a natural starter-upper. A 
year after graduating in 1983, he moved 
to New York and got a job at a market-
research company. Soon after, he founded 
Jupiter Communications — a company 

that collected data on how people would use media to connect in 
the future.

Eventually, Harris grew tired of predicting the Internet’s future 
through data reports. In 1994, he tried his hand at a video-chat Web 
site — a makeshift creation he dubbed Pseudo.com. 

According to 1984 UCSD alumnus Marc Geiger — Harris’ col-
lege buddy and business associate — Harris was a visionary in the 
dot-com industry, though a little ahead of his time.

“You’d get two frames, then buffering,” Geiger said. “Audio, then 
buffering — and that was the world. Just like a really bad experience 
you have today when you’re like ‘Shit, I have to reload the page.’ 
That was the best experience.”

Despite technological limits, Pseudo bumped Harris into a 
crowd of young, elite millionaires who ran the dot-com scene in an 
area of downtown Manhattan dubbed Silicon Alley. 

“In New York or Silicon Valley or Israel or Boston or Seattle, it 
was like bands: You had real scenes,” Geiger said. “Like the grunge 
scene in Seattle. Except in Palo Alto, it was Yahoo and Excite, eBay. 
Microsoft was up in Seattle. New York had a whole different set of 
stuff.”

As money poured in, Harris began throwing extravagant, 
future-themed parties to collect young, creative recruits who would 
help him build Pseudo. Media orgs flocked to profile the dot-com 
bubble’s twisted leader, and Harris didn’t hold back. He was known 
for showing up in creepy clown attire to magazine shoots and cor-
porate parties acting like Luvvy, his emotional alter-ego. 

Harris’ bold personality didn’t mesh well with potential inves-
tors though, and as the antics continued, Pseudo began to slip from 
his grip. The two parted ways in 1999, and with piles of money 
to spend, Harris set his sights on a social experiment he named 

With gobs of money and an appetite 
for chaos, one UCSD alum takes 
21st-century voyeurism to the limit.

SITESEEN C ups Organic Cupcakes in downtown La Jolla puts an entirely new spin on 
the hip new world of minature 
confections. Made with sustain-
able, organic ingredients — with 
gluten-free, dairy-free and 
vegan options — these small 
indulgences aren’t from your 
grandma’s Betty Crocker box. 

Flavors range from caramel 
macchiato (espresso-chocolate 
batter topped with mascarpone 
mousse and caramel sauce) 
to lime-chili-mango (mango-
batter topped with lime-chili 
butter cream) to Zanzibar chai 
(vanilla-bean topped with spicy-
sweet chai frosting) — enough 
to satisfy the even swankiest of 
cravings. 

But Cups has more to 
offer than bite-sized desserts 
crowned in cream caps. After 
you’ve filled up on cake, perch 
yourself on a red vinyl stool and 
order a coffee at the espresso 
bar, then gaze out onto Girard 
Avenu.

If it all tastes so good you 
want to sing and dance, the 
store’s live deejay — stationed in 
the corner — will pause some 
T.I. to set up the store’s karaoke 
machine. Free WiFi and wrap-
around couches in the back also 
make for a good study spot — 
but if you’re easily distracted, 
bring earplugs. 

Unsurprisingly, Cups is a lit-
tle pricey: A normal-sized cup-
cake will cost you $4, mini cakes 
will cost you $2 and drinks are 
almost twice as much as at the 
Living Room down the street.

And of 
course, due 
to its prime 
spot in 
downtown 

La Jolla, Cups lacks convenient 
parking, and its small square-
footage — when combined 
with an overly zealous karaoke 
singer on her 30-minute lunch 
break — gets to feeling pretty 
cramped. 

Though the close proximity 
of PupCups (cupcake-shaped 
dog treats) to human desserts 
in the display case might be 
disconcerting, Cups is overall 
a classy cross between modern 
lounge, sidewalk cafe and candy 
store.

It’s a great place to go for 
your birthday, your friend’s 
post-breakup cheer session or a 
study break when you’re hoping 
to cram all the sugar high you 
can stomach. At the very least, 
it’s a good casual-dessert alter-
native to ensure you don’t OD 
on fro-yo.

UNCOMMON

A MODEL IN THE MAKING
folk

L ike so many girls, Earl Warren College sophomore Monica Pearce always wished she could be a super-model. But when she entered to win Clinique’s Fresh 
Faces Tour, she never actually expected to be selected as 
one of three winners — beating over 8,000 other college 
entrants — and scoring a spot in the pages of Teen Vogue.

“I can’t really explain the excitement I felt when I won,” 
Pearce said. “It really is something I’ll never forget. It was 
really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The whole time I 
was like, ‘Pinch me, am I really here?’” 

Pearce first noticed the Clinique trailer — parked across 
from the Student Services Center, — when she saw the 
winding line of girls it had attracted on Oct. 28. Looking to 
blow off some steam after midterms, she decided that a free 
makeover from her favorite cosmetics brand couldn’t hurt. 

After standing in line for an hour and a half, profes-
sional stylists prepped her hair and makeup for 30 minutes, 
and a photographer took three snapshots of her. They were 
then entered into Clinique’s Fresh Faces Contest.

“They actually had a camera crew, and they hooked up 
a microphone to me and followed me throughout the whole 
experience,” Pearce said. “That was kind of when I thought 
that maybe I can win. It felt like I was on a reality TV show… 
I was like, maybe I should stand up a little straighter.”

Still, Pearce was shocked when she learned on Nov. 19, 
2009 that she had made it into the top 25 girls in the compe-
tition. She received an e-mail to check the contest Web site, 
which featured her picture among the finalists. From there, 
the site stated that online polls — along with a Teen Vogue 
and Clinique panel — would decide the three winners. 

At first, she only told a few friends. But eventually she 
began recruiting the support of her hometown community 
in Elk Grove and her sisters in Delta Gamma.

“On Facebook, I updated my status every once in while, 
asking people to vote for me,” Pearce said. “I didn’t want to 
overdo it and do it every day, every minute. I didn’t want 
it to be all about me all the time. That’s why I think my 
friends [supported me] and were really happy for me.”

Pearce said she also owes some credit to her ethnicity: 
She’s half Chinese and half Irish-Swedish-Scottish, a mix 
that according to Pearce, gave her a diverse look that fit the 
ideals of Clinique’s new “fresh face” campaign.

“They thought that I had a different look,” Pearce 
said. “In today’s world, you don’t meet someone with one 
nationality; that’s what’s creating this new fresh look. No 
one fits a stereotypical model look anymore.”

The prizes for the three winners included a five-day, all-
expenses-paid trip to New York — complete with tickets to 
“Wicked” and a behind-the-scenes tour of the Teen Vogue 

and Clinique offices. The girls already participated in photo 
shoots in Times Square and the Teen Vogue warehouse, 
where they were glammed out by makeup artists, hair styl-
ists and outfit coordinators. 

Pictures from the shoots will appear as an insert in the 
April issue of Teen Vogue.

“[The photo shoot] was a really interesting process,” 
Pearce said. “I was the only one of the two that hadn’t had 
any modeling experience. I didn’t know how to pose or do 
any facial expressions, but they were really nice and taught 
me how to pose. I just like to smile though. I don’t really like 
to do the whole serious look. I was just having so much fun.”

With the help of some lights and bass-heavy back-
ground music, Pearce said she warmed to the shoot. She 
said her favorite aspect was trying on clothes she could 
before only admire as a subscriber to Teen Vogue. 

“The stylist who dressed me for both photo shoots gave 
me some tips on how to dress,” Pearce said. “Because I’m

College students have been going to Tommy’s since 1946 for the

Prints“Quiet: We Live in Public.”He rented out an underground bunker in New York City, gutted 
it and filled it with a dining area, a 
kitchen, a church, a firing range and 
rows of “pods” (sleeping chambers 
modeled after those in concentration 
camps). Surveillance cameras were 
hooked up in every crevice. Each pod 
came with a monitor and a camera, so 
capsule residents could keep tabs on 
their neighbors. Harris also employed 
Stasi-like psychologists to interrogate 
participants and further invade their 
privacy. Those who volunteered to 
participate were forced to wear uni-
forms and live in the quarters for 30 
days. In all, the project cost about $2 
million.

The results were frightening. 
People had sex in the shower, crapped 
together, unloaded powerful firearms, 
stomped stark-naked — like a march-
ing band — on the dinner table and 
listened to Harris’ cultish sermons at 
the altar of the “We Live in Public” 
pseudo-church. The occupants’ 
energy fluctuated from giddy to angry, 

impatient to psychotic — that is, until 
the project was shut down by the 
NYPD on New Year’s Day of Y2K. 

Hungry for more, Harris asked 
his girlfriend, a show host on Pseudo.
com, to live with him in a spacious 
New York loft. The catch? It was wired 
with loads of cameras — installed in 
the fridge, the litter box and the toilet, 
among more obvious places — and 
72 hypersensitive microphones. Users 
watched and chatted with the couple 
online as if they were close friends.

The invasiveness of surveillance, 
coupled with the dot-com stock-mar-
ket bust, ate away at Harris’ relation-
ship. Once his girlfriend left him and 
he’d gone broke, he fled from the city 
and bought an apple farm.

Since then, he’s had a number of 
failed projects, and moved to Ethiopia 
a few years back in search of total 
isolation — so much isolation, in fact, 
that even his creditors can’t find him.

While Harris was soul-searching, 
Ondi Timoner — a participant in 
Harris’ capsule experiment — directed 
and produced a documentary of the 
dot-com millionaire’s life, fittingly 

titled “We Live in Public.” The film 
won the Sundance Film Festival’s 
Grand Jury Prize in 2009. 

“I didn’t realize while filming the 
bunker that this was Josh’s physical 
prediction of how life online would 
be, “ Ondi Timoner said in the film.

Now, Harris is back in LA, crashing 
in his friend’s pool house while pitch-
ing his latest commentary on technol-
ogy’s pervasiveness: “The Wired City.” 
It’s a cross between World of Warcraft 
and “The Truman Show,” and Harris 
hopes to unleash it upon the public as 
soon as he can find funds.

Though he’s kept his distance from 
his alma mater during the media 
journey, Harris says his time at UCSD 
helped him conceive of his social 
experiments.

“What I figured out when I was at 
UCSD, I really had a chance to think 
through everything that I’m manifest-
ing right now,” Harris said. “I dreamed 
the dream. The fundamental thinking 
was done there.”

petite, [he] told me what worked and 
what didn’t for my body type.”

As an urban studies and planning 
major, Pearce also said she found the 
business and marketing aspects of her 
trip fascinating. At the Clinique and 
Teen Vogue offices, Pearce conversed 
with company directors about their 
products and advertising techniques.

“I got to go behind the scenes of 
Teen Vogue and Clinique, seeing how 
the companies run and seeing how 
much effort they put into product 
and magazine and really how that 
business is run,” Pearce said. “It was 
a side [of fashion] that I’ve never 
thought about before or seen.”

Pearce met many captains in the 
fashion industry, including the Teen 
Vogue publisher, health and beauty 
director and editor-in-chief, as well as 
the Clinique president of marketing 
for North America.

“I got business cards form every-
one I met,” Pearce said. “I’ve been 
e-mailing back and forth. I even asked 
about internships, and they were 
really open to the idea.”

Pearce is now considering taking 
up a minor in economics — a tip from 
one of her newfound business contacts 
— in case she ever decides to pursue 
a career within the fashion industry. 
Still, she hasn’t ruled out modeling.

“I’m actually going to put a port-

folio [of my pictures] together, just in 
case I ever want to model for fun or 
anything,” Pearce said. “We’ll see what 
happens. I’m a student for now, but 
I’m willing to keep an open mind.”

After her trip, Pearce also received 
$1,000 toward Clinique products.

“What am I going to do with 
$1,000?” Pearce said. “I let my two 
friends choose some, as well as 
my mom and grandma and sister. 
Even my dad chose out a [bottle of] 
cologne. They said that it will last a 
whole year, but I’m probably good for 
the next five years.”

SPORTS� TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

Tritons found their shooting range, 
closing the game on an 11-5 run.  
Senior guard Jordan Lawley was 
clutch down the stretch, scoring the 
final four points of the game.  Lawley 
tallied his third double-double of 
the season with 24 points and 10 
rebounds.  

The UCSD offense shot 45 per-
cent from the field — just enough to 
top Stanislaus.

With two straight wins under 
their belt, the Triton men took on 
Chico. Tied with the Wildcats at half-
time, Chico State came out of the 
break with an offensive firestorm, 
starting the second half on a 10-0 
run. The Tritons couldn’t recover 
from the deficit. 

After a dominating defensive 

performance against Stanislaus, 
the Tritons couldn’t stop Chico’s 
Roderick Hawkins and Jon Baird, 
who combined for 25 points.  

After splitting its two games on 
the road trip, Carlson said the team is 
drawing on the positives to tackle the 
rest of the season. 

“Overall, it was a successful road 
trip,” Carlson said. “There is still a lot 
of basketball to be played this season.”

The Tritons have five games left 
in the regular season, including three 
this week. They will play against Cal 
State East Bay on Feb. 16 at RIMAC 
Arena, before leaving on another 
road trip to San Francisco State and 
Cal State Monterey Bay.

team on the final day.
The women sealed their victo-

ry with 1,379 points — a mere 6.5 
points ahead of Loyola Marymount 
University.

Tan, one of the freshmen bound 
for nationals, said she was elated at 
having qualified in the final race of 
the competition: the women’s 400-
yard freestyle relay.

“It is unbelievable making nation-
als, because I just barely missed the 
cut on my races,” Tan said. “But I got 
a last chance with the relay, and my 
coaches were ecstatic. We won by six 
points … and were going back and 
forth all day.”

Head coach Scott McGihon said 
the team’s last-day heroics were a tes-
tament to both their mental strength 
and wealth of talent.

“We didn’t actually have the race 
won after the third day,” McGihon 

said.  “Seattle still had a strong chance. 
But our performance on the last day 
just shows our great depth, and that 
we have a much better competitive 
atmosphere than anyone else.”

Henley was UCSD’s top female 
performer. She won four individual 
events: the 500-yard freestyle, the 
200-yard individual medley, the 200-
yard butterfly and the 200-yard back-
stroke (in which she broke the meet 
record with a time of 2:00.52). Henley 
also finished second in the 400-yard 
individual medley and third in the 
100-yard butterfly, behind winner 
and teammate senior Karla Holman 
— who took the event with a time 
of 56.78.

Other top performances for the 
women’s team were sophomore 
Shea Kopp’s 100-yard backstroke, 
Shimura’s second-place finish in 
the same event and freshman Beth 
Dong’s victory in the 1,650-yard free-

style race.
On the men’s side, senior Daniel 

Perdew won the meet’s first event 
— the 50-yard freestyle — in typical 
lightning fashion, and later won the 
100-yard butterfly. Senior Juan Pablo 
Carrillo won the 100-yard breast-
stroke and senior Jereme Barnett-
Woods won the 1,650-yard freestyle 
event. Freshman Shaun Stringer 
finished up the domination for the 
Tritons as he won the 200-yard but-
terfly.

For the divers, senior Danielle 
Niculescu took first in the women’s 
one-meter diving event with a total 
score of 235.70 — only 1.65 points 
ahead of the second place finisher. 
Freshman Tyler Runsten grabbed 
first place in the three-meter event 
and second in the one-meter event.

freshman middle blocker Cyrus Kiani sent down 
a kill for a 30-28 win, forcing another set.

In the decisive fifth set, the Gauchos scored 
four of the first five points, but UCSD fought back 
to 7-6. With the score tied at 10-10, the Gauchos 
scored consecutive points, piling pressure on the 
Tritons. After a UCSB error, UCSD fought back 
to draw the game at 14-14. However, a UCSB kill 

and block sealed the end of the match at 16-14, in 
favor of the Gauchos.

UCSB junior outside hitter Jeff Menzel proved 
to be the star of the match, sending down a 
match-high 33 kills. Spangler led UCSD with 23 
kills, and Davidson followed with 19. Fritsch and 
junior middle blocker Calvin Ross added seven 
kills each; the latter made a team-high nine blocks.

Redshirt freshman opposite Alex Simon came 

off the bench to contribute six kills in the match. 
Andrew Kaban had a match-high 14 digs, and 
Bannan managed a double-double in the match 
with 66 assists and 11 digs.

In spite of the disappointing outcome, head 
coach Kevin Ring said he is pleased with the 
team’s performance.

“Overall, I’m pretty pleased with how we 
played in the matches,” Ring said. “We did pretty 

well coming back to tie the sets, and just need 
better execution to win the points.”

The Tritons will return to action on Feb. 19 
and Feb. 20, when they host back-to-back games 
against Brigham Young University beginning at 7 
p.m. in RIMAC Arena.

SWIMMING & DIVING — 
After four days of intense com-
petition against some of the West 
Coast’s premier universities, the 
UCSD men’s and women’s swim-
ming and diving teams emerged 
as repeat winners of the Pacific 
Collegiate Swim Conference 
Championships, held in Long 
Beach from Feb. 10 through Feb. 
13.

“It feels amazing to be a part 
of a championship team,” fresh-
man sprint Amber Tan said. 
“The competition was fierce, but 
this team is great for sure.”

The Tritons swept teams 
from California, Arizona, 
Washington and Alaska on the 
climb to their third conference 
title in four years.

After their dominating 

performance last weekend, 
the Tritons will rest and pre-
pare for the NCAA Division-II 
Championships in Canton, OH 
— the biggest meet of the year — 
where they will compete against 
the best teams in the country.

“We’re looking for compe-
tition and trying to race well 
against strong competitors,” 
senior captain Cari Cunningham 
said. “But you have times to 
make every meet, and we try to 
improve on past meets.”

Going into the weekend, 
22 Triton athletes had already 
qualified for nationals — four 
fewer than they sent to last year’s 
competition. However, due in 
large part to several outstanding 
freshmen performances, they 
emerged from the weekend with 
28 national qualifiers. 

While the men’s team won 
its conference by the third day 

— finishing with 1,535 points 
and bettering nearest competi-
tor Seattle University by 172.5 
points — the women’s team went 
down to the wire with Loyola 
Marymount University. 

The 400-yard freestyle 
relay team of Tan, junior Anju 
Shimura, freshman Jessica 
Ferguson and sophomore Alex 
Henley finished in second place 
with a time of 3:27.04, sealing 
the first place overall victory for 
the Tritons.

The win was even more sur-
prising considering the Triton 
women were only in third place 
after the first day, 60 points 
beneath Pepperdine University.

Undeterred, the Tritons 
jumped into first place on the 
second day, and barely held off

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The No. 
13 UCSD men’s volleyball team was 
swept by No. 1 Cal State Northridge 
on Feb. 12 at RIMAC Arena 30-26, 
30-26, 30-27.

UCSD leveled the score in each 
set to 20-20, but the Matadors proved 
the stronger team, claiming all three 
sets with late rallies. The loss dropped 
UCSD to 4-8 overall, with a 1-6 
record in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation.

In the first set, the score was tied 
15 times — the last at 23-23, after a 
kill from senior outside hitter Jason 
Spangler. The Matadors scored the 
next five points to claim a 28-23 lead, 
before closing the set with a 30-26 
victory.

The second set played out much 
like the first. After 14 ties, the 
Matadors scored five of six points to 
take a 25-21 lead. The Tritons then 
rallied back to reduce the Matadors’ 
lead to 27-25. However, Cal State 
Northridge eventually took the set 
30-26.

In the third set, UCSD led 16-15 
after a kill from junior middle blocker 
Adrian Guthals. Cal State Northridge 
fought back to tie the set at 20-20, 
then scored the next three points by 
two kills and a UCSD error. UCSD 
fought back to 26-25, but Cal State 
Northridge widened the gap to 28-25.

The Matadors claimed the third 
set 30-27. The Tritons hit at .500 in 
the third set, while the Matadors hit 
at .486.

Senior opposite hitter Frank Fritsch 
led the Tritons with 17 kills, junior 
outside hitter Joel Davidson had 11 
kills and Spangler contributed 10 kills 
for UCSD. Sophomore libero Andrew 
Kaban made a match-high 11 digs, 
while junior setter Phil Bannan con-
tributed 45 assists. Guthals had seven 
kills on .667 hitting and five blocks.

With no rest for the weary, 
the Tritons faced off against No. 
10 UC Santa Barbara on Feb. 13. 
Unfortunately, they were defeated 
by the Gauchos 28-30, 33-31, 30-21, 
28-30, 16-14. This was the third 
match of the season that was settled 
in five sets, with UCSB victorious in 
the last two. 

With the score tied at 27-27, the 
Tritons grabbed the next two points 
with a kill from Davidson and a UCSB 
error. Davidson closed out the set 
with another kill.

The second set saw 16 ties, and 
neither team held more than a three-
point lead at any time. The Tritons led 
26-23 after a Davidson ace, but the 
Gauchos scored four straight points 
to regain the lead. After UCSD took 
a 31-30 lead when Bannan pounded 
a kill after a UCSB overpass, UCSB 
tied the match again with a block, and 
a UCSD attacking error handed the 
Gauchos the set.

Despite a .444 hitting percent-
age, the Tritons came up short: The 
Gauchos dominated the third set 
30-21.

In the fourth set, UCSD led 
26-20 after a service error from the 
Gauchos. UCSB fought back within 
27-25 before a Spangler kill helped 
UCSD regain the focus. However, the 
Gauchos did not give up, narrowing 
UCSD’s lead to 29-28.

Fortunately for the Tritons, redshirt

MEN’S BASKETBALL — In their best 
defensive effort of the season, the Triton 
basketball players drove home a 56-48 
victory over Cal State Stanislaus on Feb. 
12. Sadly, it was followed by a 58-42 loss to 
Chico State on Feb. 13.  

In the first game, the UCSD defense 
held the Warriors to just 30-percent 
shooting and 48 points — both sea-
son lows for a Triton opponent — and 
allowed only 10 points by the Stanislaus 
starters. 

“Any time you can hold a team to 
40-percent field-goal percentage or less, 
it gives you a good chance,” head coach 
Chris Carlson said.

The victory against the Warriors was 
only the second time this season UCSD 
posted back-to-back wins.  It was also only 
the second road victory for the Tritons.

Hanging onto a two-point 45-43 lead 
with four-and-a-half minutes left, the

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — After a string of 
blowout UCSD victories, the Chico State Wildcats 
proved the Tritons are not as invincible as they once 
seemed. 

The UCSD women’s basketball team split its 
set of weekend road games, crushing Cal State 
Stanislaus 83-60 on Friday Feb. 12 before falling to 
Chico on Saturday Feb. 13 by a score of 77-67. The 
Tritons had won their last four consecutive games 
by 17 points or more before the Saturday-night 
dethroning.

There was little doubt of Friday night’s outcome 
from early on: The Tritons started the game on a 
10-0 run, en route to their resounding 23-point vic-
tory over Stanislaus. UCSD held a 42-22 advantage 
at halftime, and led by as much as 32 points in the 
second half. 

On Friday night, sophomore guard Chelsea 
Carlisle led scoring with 17 points. Junior forward 
Tiffany Hunter added 13 points and five rebounds. 
Overall, 12 different Tritons contributed to the final 
score in UCSD’s 14th straight win over Stanislaus.

The Tritons forced 24 turnovers that they con-
verted into 27 points.

“Our defense started creating easy offensive 
opportunities for us, which is always our goal,” head 
coach Charity Elliott said.

Alisha Kelley scored 17 points to lead the 
Warriors, who fell to 5-16 overall and 4-13 in 
California Collegiate Athletic Association play.

On Saturday, Carlisle scored 18 points — on top 

of  17 points and nine rebounds from Hunter, but it 
was not enough to overcome a night of poor shoot-
ing, and the Tritons fell for only the second time 
this season. The Tritons shot just 32 percent from 
the floor, and hit only eight shots from the field in 
the second half.

Chico came out strong and led for the entire 
first half, going into the break with a 38-32 lead. 
The Tritons rallied and kept the game close, but a 
7-0 run with 8:24 remaining gave the Wildcats an 
eight-point advantage that the Tritons were unable 
to close. Chico hit its free throws down the stretch, 
going 8-10 from the line in the final two minutes to 
seal the win.

Chico was propelled by a career-best night from 
senior guard Melissa Richardson, who scored 26 
points on 9-18 shooting. The Wildcats also played 
well in the post, scoring 30 of their points in the 
paint and out-rebounding the Tritons 51-39.

On top of seeing its six-game winning streak 
snapped, UCSD fell to 20-2 overall and 15-2 in con-
ference play. The Wildcats won their fourth straight 
game to reach 15-8 overall and 12-6 in the CCAA.

The Tritons will attempt a comeback on Tuesday 
against Cal State East Bay.

“I think we’ve made some great strides and have 
come to realize that you don’t get any do-overs,” 
Elliot said. “Every game is important.”

UCSD will then travel to Northern California 
to play against San Francisco State and Cal State 
Monterey Bay on Friday and Saturday.
