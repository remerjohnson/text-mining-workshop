UC Not Given $12 
Million of Budget 

From the Associa ted Prell 
SACRAMENTO - Gov. Edmund Brown 

Jr. unveiled a $24 billion state budget bill 
yesterday which includes $960 million of the 
University of California's requested $972 
million in funding. 

The budget as a whole includes a $1.5 billion 
deficit, wiping out the last of California's mid-
decade huge cash surplus. 

Despite not getting $12 million requested, 
UC's budget will rise 5.8 percent, or $54 
million. 

The budget figures are based on estimates by 
UC officials that enrollment will decline by 
about 121,000 students. 

But the university is involved in another 
budget squabble that some legislators ay could 
become on of the most important of the 1981 
budget fight. 

Potentially the most controversial items in 
the budget involve relatively small dollar 
amounts: $32 million for an expected 107,000 
Medi·Calif-financed abortions and a proposal 
to divert $154 million In state oil revenues from 
a college construction fund to the state general 
fund and a new energy and resources fund. 

"We are looking forward to declining 
enrollments" on the University of California 
and the state university and colleges campuses, 
said Finance Director Mary Ann Graves. "It 
does not seem just or equitable or right to me to 
have all that money flow into the higher 
education construction fund." 

She said with rising oil prices, the stal t· 
expects rna sive increases In its tidelands 011 
revenues, up from $110 million last year to at 
least $270 million - and possibly $450 million 
- in the 1980-81 fiscal year. 

lbat will allow diversion of the tidelands 
money to energy and other projects without 
cutting the actual number of construction and 
maintenance dollars available to the University 
of California and the state universities, Ms. 
Graves said. . 

However, there is a long tradition of 

earmarking the tidela nds money for higher 
education, which has a vocal lobby in the 
Capitol, and the fund diversion proposed in 
Brown's budget cannot be made unless the 
Legislature approves separate legislation. 

The oil revenue proposal was prompted by 
the federal deregulation of oil prices, which will 
boost revenues from oil produced by private 
companies on state-owned tidelands. 

Most of that money - about $ 72 million last 
year, and more than twice that amount his year 
- is reserved, by state law, for construction

Coincidences Open Minds 
By Rata Guataiti. 

You're walking down a Ilreet in a stranse 
town and, by weird coincidence, you meet the 
one "I0Il you know there. 

Of JOAl're Ihinking of a mend you have not 
aeen f. rnontJ., the phone ring. and ·yes, it'l 
that friend. 

Coincidence? ~ybe. But IOmehow that 
expIuation doeS not do away with wonder. 
You look for meaning, for auch incidenta teem 
to hint that, u Hamlet told Horatio, "There are 
more thinp in heaven and earth, Horatio, than 
are cireampt of in your philoaophy." 
GUltmtil wrote this Ito", for the Pacific News 
Service. 

Carl Gullav Jung coined a word for the 
phenomenon - .ynchronicity"7' and defined it 
81 "meaningful coincidence." The concept 
requires a point of view "diametrically oppoaed 
to that of causality," he found, becauae it 
auggeats a link between external events and the 
mind that cauaality fail. to explain. 

Plrchiatrilll have, by and large, ignored , 
Jung s thinking about thil phenomenon. "Most 
standard ideal of pI)'chiatry leave out the 
spiritual," commented Dr. Jean Shinoda Bolen, 
a San Franciaco psychiatrilt who allO teaches 
at the UC School of Medicine. Most of her 
colleagues would think a preoccupation with 
synchronicity "esoteric or even a little crazy," 
she said in an interview. She, however, has 
found it profoundly meaningful personally and 
in her work al a therapist. 

"Every time I have become aware of a 
.ynchroniltic experience I have had an 
accompanying feeling that some grace came 
along with it," Bolen wrote in a recent book, 
The Tao of Psychology - Slinchronicitll and 
the Self. "Each time another person has shared 
a synchronistic event with me, I feel like a 
privileged participant." 

Such eventl break through the ilOlation of 
the self and allow Jln individual to experience a 
relation to the totality, lhe had found, and to 
senae a unifyillg pattern, the Tao. Attending to 
them "can be a way for a perlOn to become 
more whole," by furthering insight. 

A Japanese.American, B~n is a tiny 
woman with long black hair, warm eyes and a 
ready Imile. Everything about her and her 
pleal8nt office on the 1eC0nd Roor of a two· 
Itory Victorian teemed to be in the receptive 
mode, the Itate of mind mOlt likely to allow for 
aynchronicity . 

She I8t with her vi.itor, al lhe would lit with 
a patient, in comfortable 10ft chair. placed at 
ealY conversational di.tance. Soft browns and 
blues aet the tone in the room. She hertelf wore 
earth brown, with a pink rose on the right lapel 
of her lUit the lingle adornment. 

Bolen believea that synchroni.tic eventl 

happen to everyone often, but that they go 
unnoticed much of the tirnc., the way dreams do. 
Sleep researcherl have found that everyone 
dreams lix to eight times a night, even those 
people who are sure they never do. Many 
people experience vivid and frequent dreaml in 
timea of emotional turmoil, or during periods 
when they break free of accUitomed routines. 

"Synchronicity. also aeems &0 i¥aeale in 
lOme dimension when there il intensity of 
feeling, whether that feeling be due to falling in 
love, or being in a period of creative struggle, or 
meeting a heightened state of emotional 
conflict," she I8YS. 

As therapilt, she WOrkl both with dreaml 
and with synchroniatic happeningl. Sometimes 
their meaning is immediately aPPBrent to her 
and her parenb. But more often lhe baa 
obaerved a repetitive paHern that eventually 
leacla to lOme underltanding. 

She recalls one woman who had three auto 
accidents in a row, though her driving record tiD 
then had been clear. Each time, she was 

a~ently blameless. 
first a driver rear-ended her as she waited in 

center lane for a Hght to change. The street was 
slick and the other woman braked too late. 

Next, she was moving with traffic in center 
lane when another woman IUddenly changed 
lanes and hit her. 

Then a third woman hit her, again while Ihe 
was waiting, stopped in center lane for a light, . 
and again from the rear. The other driver's 
brakes had failed. 

The aequence became still more baffling 
when this woman learned that on the day of her 
third accident a co· worker , with whom she was 
trying to be friends, allO luffered a brake 
failure. At this point she made a mental link: 
jUit before her 6rst collision she had luffered an 
emotional shock in an incident with the! co· 
worker. She now realized that the attemptlo be 
friends was mutually destructive and decided to 
end the effort. 

A caUiai explanation of this aet of accidents 
eludes. But "like a aerie. of dream. in which the 
same theme is repeated in different settings until 
the dreamer got the message," the collisions 
aerved this woman in helping her understand a 
relationship. 

Working with achizophrenics, Bolen has 
observed that "When they are on the edge of 
illness, real synchronistic evenb happen at a 
greater rate." This il an indication of 
heightened emotional level, not of i1lnell, lhe 
strelled. "What wal alarming was the meaning 
they gave these evenb." 

Most psychiatri.ts reject reporb of 
synchroniltic events a. fi,menta of 
IChizophrenic imagination. and 10 Iole their 
patienb' trust, Bolen has found. Yet exploring 
them with the patient can lead to 
breakthroul{hs.

Baha'is On 
Iran Crisis 

Editor: 

The takeover of the 
American Embassy in Tehran 
has provoked numerous 
opinions from the American 
people that have been widely 
~blicized by the . news media. 
Though it is not our intent to 
agree or disagree with any of 
thOle opinion" we find it 
necessary to clarify one balic 
misunderltanding. 

Many Itatements have been 
directed towards Iranian 
studenb and Iranians in 
general al though they were 
equally responsible for the 
situation in Iran. We feel this is 
unjUlti6ed. 

Prelently there are many 
Iranians in the United States 
who are members of the 
Baha'i Faith. Many of them 
are here because of the severe 
persecutions inflicted on them 
by the new Revolutionary 
Government of Iran. 

Becauae of the non-r!litical 
character of the Baha i Faith, 
its members are enjoined to 
give obedience to the 
government of the country in 
which they relide and to avoid 
involvement in political 
matters. 

We pray that the solution to 
this situation will be befitting of 
mankind.

privilege of public harassment 
(publicly scrutinizing and 
commenting on a woman's 
appearance indulgently 
viewed as a "boys will be 
boys" pastime) has been 
culturally sanctioned for men 
only and traditionally men 
have enjoyed the preroS!ltive 
of sexual initiative. These 
actions and attitudes leave 
women open to sexual 
coercion. Incidents of sexual 
harassment both reflect and 
reinforce women's subordinate 
status in our culture. 

It is for these reasons that 
my work focuses on sexual 
harassment of women by men. 
I would encourage Mr Martin, 
and any man who wishes to 
explore these issues further

attend the "For Men Only:

goals of the workshop are to 
learn how psychological

feelings experienced by 
victims (whether male or

coping lkills for victims, their

Anti-Iran:

Editor: 
Watching the attacks upon 

Iranianl in the US, one is 
reminded of a time nearly 40 
years ago when several events 
fueled hysteria and violence 
that culminated in the forced 
incarceration of 110,000 
men, women and children in 
American concentrahon 
camps. The victims' only 
crime was their Japaneae

Though we hope that this 
tragedy may never recur, 
again we lee a group of people

Americans, recognize that 
theae attackl upon Iranian. in 
America are a pP.I1)etuation of 
the lame racism which we 
have faced in the put and 
which we continue to face 
now. 

Therefore, the A.ian

Political Executions 
Continue in Afghanistan 

KABUL, Afghani.tan (AP) - '{be new Soviet·backed 
Afghan government, which took power with vows to end official 
brutality, is secrety continuing the execution of pOlitical 
prisoners, Afghan sources and Western diplomats said 
Tuesday. 

Anti·communist Afghan rebels meanwhile, claimed to have 
captured a border post just south of the Soviet border after nine 
days of bloody fighting with Russian and Afghan government 
troops. 

Horse·mounted guerrillas staged hit·run forays against white· 
clad Soviet troops in the snowswept northern hill provinces, 
eyewitnesses reported. Rebel sources in neighboring Pakistan 
daimed the guerrillas were successfully holding out against the 
Soviets anti Afghan soldiers in other. corners of Afghanistan. 

But the mechanized, air.supported Red Army force . 
estimated at as many as 100,000 men· was reported in control 
of most major cities and towns. 

The United States followed through Tuesday on retaliatory 
steps in protest of the Soviet involvement here . moving to 
restrict Soviet fishing in US waters, ordering a reduction in US 
f1gihts by the Soviet airline Aeroflot, and going ahead with plans 
to withdraw a US consular mission from the Soviet city of Kiev, 
while alking the Soviets to withdraw consular employees from 
New York. 

In Moscow, the soviet media intensified their charEthat the 
United States, allied with China, Pakistan and t, was 
behind the "military aggression" of Afghan rebels fig ting the 
new government here. The newspaper Pravda said the 
American CIA sponlOred formation of a "broad alliance Df 
forces hostile to the Afllhan revolution" in 1978-79. 

After Babrak KarmaT was put in power here by a Soviet·led 
coup Dec. 27, he declared that the ousted regime of fellow 
Marxist Hafizullah Amin had subjected the Afghan people to 
"intolerable violence and tortures" and that such repression 
would be ended. 

Th~ new government claimed that 2,073 political prisoners 
were released from Kabul's notorious PuI·I·Charkhi prilOn last 
Sunday under an amnesty, but Kabul residents reported seeing 
only about 300 freed. -

Moreover, said one ranking Western diplomat here, "we have 
information that executions continue." He and other sources 
here, none of whom wanted their names uled, said they were 
certain that officials of the Amin regime ~ere being executed 
aecretly and buried in mass graves on unpopulated hillsidea near 
theprilOn. 

The aources gave no figures or names for the reported 
victiml. 

Khomeini Gives 
An Ultimatum' 

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, 
who plans to .pend 15 days in seclulion to recover from 
"excessive fatigue," met with his special negotiating team for 
Kurdistan on Tuesday and resolved to give the rebellious Kurds 
an ultimatum, according to the official news agency Pars. 

Four government police were killed, apparently accidentally, 
in a confrontation with a group of insurgents in the tenle western 
regi()O 01 Kurdittan, Pari said. 

Khomeini, who cancelled all appointrnentl beginning 
Saturday, asked that demon.tratiol111 planned from that aay on,

In W aahi"'to~, an informed official said the State 
Department il beginning to believe no one, not even Khomeini, 
controls the militants who hold the US Embassy in Tehran and 
some 50 American hostages. That, he said, is why the United 
States it pressing on with itl effort. to get the United Nationl to 
impole economic sanction. againlt Iran. 

"The.e terrorists ... are swimming in a aea of IUpport from the 
Iranian government and people. We would Hke to aeparate them 
from that support," he said. 

Fighting and violent dernonstrationa have escalated Iteadily 
in Iran', provinces, where ethnic and reliaPou. minorites have

The outcry against the City

While the City of Dd Mar.

Redford's Back as Rhinestone Horseman 
By Lynette Tom 

Senior Staff Writer 
On the whole, The Electric 

Horseman is a well· made and 
entertaining film. While the 
joint release by Columbia 
Pictures and Univer.a1 Studios 
is not something to get overly 
excited about. the movie does 
herald the cinematic return of 
Robert Redford, as well as 
feature the comedy/romantic 
compatibibty between Redford 
and co-star Jane Fonda. 

Sonny Steele is a survivor of 
the vanishing breed of 
American cowboys. He turns 
in his rodeo competition 
awards for a lucrative contract 
in selling breakfast cereal. and 
thereby refrains from topping 
Evel Knievel in the amount of 
metal which holds his body 
together. After a couple of 
years of humiliating public 
relations appearances at local 
grocery stores and degrading 
riding stints during football 
halftime shows, Sonny decides 
he wants out. His decision gets 
added strength from the 
rul<co'li'erv that hi. co·slar a 

thoroughbred named Rising 
Star. has been pump..<>d up with 
steroids and tranquilizers. 
Their subsequent defection 
from the bright bghts of La. 
Vegas to the chapparal of 
Utah attracts the journalistic 
curiosity, then romantic 
interest, of Hallie Martin. a 
city-bred newswoman. The 
plot foDows the old storyline of 
a good old country boy.turned 
superstar.turned disillusioned 
victim of the big bad business 
world, with a liberal helping of 
a hate ·at -first -sight , odd-
couple love story. 

What saves The Electric 
Horseman from its obviously 
dated plotting and inevitable 
boredom is the acting. Robert 
Redford proves that he still has 
it after his three-year 
hermitage from Hollywood. 
His role as Sonny Steele is 
every bit the rhinestone 
cowboy in the popular song by 
Glen CampbeU. 

Jane Fonda once again 
plays the part of a television 
broadcaster. She is very much 
like the forward and

some of the best dialogue in 
terms of its acerbity and also 
some of the worst in terms of 
its triteness. However. the 

verbal exchanges that OCClD' 
between Redford and Fonda

A Male as Mother: 
Hoffman Makes Impqrtant Point Stick 

By Neal Mende ...... 
The acene is a custody court, 

New York aty . Ted Kramer is 
waliChinc hi. lawyer "play_ mean" 
with hi. ex-wife Joanna Kramer. 
hnplication. are thrown about the 
court hinting at MR. Kramer'. 
promiscuity, irreaponsibility, 
inatability and her failure in 
marriage when, 18 months ago, 
she "walked out" on her husband 
and child. The questioning over, 
Kramer asks his lawyer why he is 
r,!oceding 10 cruelly. He replies, 
'You want the kid don't you?" 

Custody court is a cruel and 
expenaive game, created out of 
eelfishness and revenge. Both 
parties want to win, but there is no 
winning. The child is the only 
victim while, ironically, the 
parents grow up, as they realize 
the difference between caring and 
eelfiahness. 

Kramer vs. Kramer is the 
emotional movie of the year, and 
possibly the besl (Accomplish-
ing this without one spaceship, 

black hole or exploding planet). 
What it does have it Dustin 
Halfman a Ted Kramer, who 
turns in the finest performance by 
an actor in 1979, Hit strength 
and akiII a an actor are well 
defined by thia part. His visible 
growth and emotion throughout 
the film create, like the movie 
itself, ' a slice of today's reality, 
without social graces, but 
certainly with emotional truth. 

He is supported by Justin 
Henry, who pla2's his seven-year· 
old son, Billy. Too many times I 
shake my head at kid actors 
because they look like just that·· 
kid actors, acting. Justin Henry 
doesn't try for Hamlet. He's a . 
kid, period . The re.sulting 
connection between Dustin 
Hoffman and Justin Henry is 
absolutely touching. It brought 
back memories of cooking 
breakfast with my father , and the 
two of us sitting down to watch a 
Sunday morning football game. 
Man hath no greater love. 

During the custody trial, 
Hoffman aska a perceptive 
question: "Where does it say that 
a woman makes a better 
parent? ... Who aays a man can't 
have the same emotiona?" Other 
questions are implied through the 
fam such as, what makes a 
perlOn fit to be a parent? 
Anybody of age can marry, and, 
with the necessary apparatus, 
can have children. Even the 
Kramers, who realize too late all 
the damage and pain they've 
unknowingly brought about. 

As the wife. Meryl Streep is 
from heavy. Her love is genui 
but so is her selfishness. She 
purposely an identifiable ty 
the·lady-who-got-herher-indepen. 
dence-while.she·got·her·head·to· 
getherin-Califomia.with.her-an-
alyst type. She is too strong to 
pitiable, and too truthful to 
hated. She is the mother, who has 
an equal right to her son. 
Throughout her scenes I couldn't 
help but try to work it out for 

Many Locals Ride SD Movie Wave

When the Twentieth 

Cenbay.Fox film Scavertller 
Hun, bunt aaoa San Diego 
ICI'eenI thia holiday leaJOn, 
many of the people in the 
audiences on opening day 
were not there merely to lee a 
funny movie. 1bey were there 
to see themselves on the big 
acreen. Scauenfer Hunt wa 
filmed almost entirely in San 
Diego lat IURU'nef and many 
hundreds of local. were uted in 
the oduction. lti. i. all very interesting, 
you may be thinking, but how 
do I get to be in the movies? 

According to Jackie 
Walter., executive secretary 
of the San Diego branch of 
The Screen Extra. Guild, it 
may not be a hard as you 
think. "Show Biz has 
changed", she say., "and not 
all firm is in the 

three major markets (Loa 
Angeles, New York and 
Chicago). Hollywood 
filmmakers are going out into 
the boondocks allover the 
United States. In San Diego, 
we are trying to get as much 
business a pouible." 

Jackie points out that San 
Die_go baa a lot to offer to 
Hollywood producer •. Natural 
beauty, excellent weather, and 
proximity to Loa Angeles, 
come with the necessary 
facilities and a lot of talent. 

'We can offer the producer 
everything they're looking for 
on a local level. It'. amazing 
how many people think that 
San Diego is still that sleepy 
little city north of the border!"

A minimum of 500 San 
Diego extras can be raised for 
a scene through the Screen 
Extras Guild. When you 
combine the members of 
AFTRA (The American 
Federation of Television and 
Radio Artists) and SAG (The 
Screen Actors Guild), you'd 
have over 600 professional 
San Diego area perfonners. 

The presence of these 
unions makes it profitable for a 
producer to come to San 
Diego to shoot a film because 
they can hire the talent locally 
and don't have to pay 
transportation and lodging 
costs. Many of the local 

AFTRA and SAG members 
will do extra work, since it 
pays $62.50 for an eight.hour 
day. And an eight-hour day is 
a rare thing in the film 
industry, which often runs into 
overtime. 

David Greene, a San Diego 
SEG member who has worked 
in Raise The Tilanic and can 
be seen falling down the stairs 
at the Balboa Park Musuem of 
Man in Scavenger Hun I , 
joined the union "for fun". But 
member Ritchie Madison paid 
the heftr regis~atio~ fee. in 
hopes 0 furthering hiS actlf'ig

SAG. To leap from SEG to 
SAG, you muat somehow land

Does 'Kramer' Work? 
Wife's Side Lost in Torrent of Tears 
By Ted Burke 

Arts f.ctitor __ 
American film makera have 

spent lOme effort in the Iaat few 
years trying to "humanize" the 
image of the male. That is, lOme 
well-meaning folks have tried to 
undermine the conventional guns 
and bu"er machismo that have 
typefied men in films by creating 
screen types that display a 
number of softer qualities·· 
sensitivity, the abifity to cry, and 
passiveness. In Kramer vs. 
Kramer, the idea that divorced 
fathers can be as good single 
parents as divorced mothers. 

Sadly, though, Kramer vs. 
Kramer does not work beyond 
the tear jer ker level. 

Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) 
is a career-obsessed advertising 
executive who's left by his wife 
Joanna (Meryl Streep). Ted fillds 
himself having to fend for himself 
and his seven-year· old son, and 
worse, discovers that he has to 
establish a relationship with a 
child he's never really known. 
After a long stretch of scenes 

MONDAY thru FRIDAY 
8:00 am to 4:00 pm 

phone' 452-2080 

showing father and ion going 
throuah a triaJ-and-error routine 
until the two of them are able to 
relate to each other, Joanna 
returns. She declares that ahe's 
moved to California, that she's 
undergoing therapy, that she 
earns thirty thousand dollars a 
year, and that she wants her IOn 
back. Ted says no, and what 
foUows is a heated court case to 
determine who'll get custody. 

The fatal fault with Kramer is 
the plot structure. Assuming that 
a story dealing with divorce 
where there 's children involved 
has two sides, the film goes out of 
the way to give Joanna short 
shrift. In the first ten or so minutes 
of the film, Streep is supposed to 
establish the character and 

i supply all the justification a 
viewer would need to believe in 
the righteousness of her cause. 
Following that , we are supplied 
with forty minutes of Ted Kramer 
fumbling and fussing with his son, 
"growing" as a human being 
whom the viewer can sympathize 

with. In the last 20 minutes, 
Joanna reappeara, demanding 
her 1011 back after proferring a 
short-order litany about how 
much she's developed once she 
was away from Ted, 

Anything that might have 
made for interesting scenes-ber 
analysis, her having to assert 
herself in the job market after 
eight years of being domicile, her 
anguish over her desertion of her 
son-are ignored as points of 
interests and are reduced to trite 
women's lib platitudes. Denied 
her reality, Joanna is nothing 
more than a cardboard" 
character who's hardly more 
believable than Snidely Whiplash . 
or any other corn·fed villian. 

In addition, Kramer vs. 
Kramer is poorly written. Robert 
Benton's direction is static, 
overdosing on medium close· ups. 
Hoffman and Streep turn in 
convincing performances , 
thought the lopsided story turns 
the film into a spotlight piece for 
Hoffman.

Men Look Strong in Basketball 
Over Winter Break; Now 7 -7 

By Barbu. Haas 
Senior Staff Writer 

Halfway through the 
aeaaon, with only four games 
remaining before the start of 
league play, the basketball 
team has astoundl!d 
opponents in achieving their 
current 7-7 record. 

The Tritons, expected to do 
much worse in preseason 
predictions, have managed an 
even record despite three 
games against Division II 
teams including nationally 
ranked Western Illinois. 

The first day of the winter 
break, Monday Dec. 10, 
UCSD hosted Principia 
College. It was only the fourth 
game of the sealOn, but the 
younger and less experienced 
home team managed to 
overcome Principia, 84· 76, to 
make their record an 
encouraging 3-1. . 

The next three games 
call1ed a change in playing 
style and a shift in philolOphy. 
Following a 98-731011 to UC 
Riverside, a 46 point lOll to 
UC Berkeley. and a rough 12 
point loss to UC Davis, Coach 
Ron Carter called a team 
meeting that lasted until 1 a.m. 
Strategies were revised and 
Carter says "We received 
some interesting feedback. 
The players were really 
communicating, and I felt that 
after that, with a new attitude 
and lOme new goals and a new 
understanding, that we were 
really a team." 

Riverside's Division II 
standing and the strength of 
the team intimidated the 
Triton cagers. The team 
wasn't prepared for the 
contest, and allowed Riverside 
to control the boards and come 
away with a win. 

The game against Berkeley 
was more frustrating -
UCSD led for the first eight 
minutes and then slowly lost 
momentum until early in the 
second half when they hit 
bottom at 40 points down. 
After a time out for a pep talk 
and lOme new ideas, the team 
went back to work and for 10 
minutes Carter said that "we 
really outplayed Berkeley. But 
the tremendous amount of 
points we were down really 
hurt us and we wouna up 
losing by 46." 

The Davis game was lost 
because of a failure in 
execution, but the talent was 
there to at least make it a close 
game. After this third loss in 
six days, Carter decided it was 
time for a change. 

The rejuvenation obviously 
aided at least the morale of the

teama went to the 12-team 
playoffs from Sldif's league 
and after the quarterfinal 
round only four teams 
remained, all from the same 
lea&tJe. 

SkJif routed the Black Holes 
in the opening round 22· 7 and 
trounced the Cardinals 14-6 to 

reach the finals. 
In the final round, Sklif met 

the always tough Slippery 
When Wet. Slippery gave 
Sklif the most trouble in their 
first game losing only 12-9. 
"They were the beat team we 
faced this year," added Eby. 

Behind the powerful 
Claudia O'Brien, SkJif was at 
their beat downing Slippery 
14-6. O'Brien, nicknamed 
"The Gun". was Sklif's main 
offensive threat.

Puckhandlers Sweep Again, But 
This Year's Championship Close 

By Tim Uotta 
Senior Staff Writer 

It was a fitting ending to the 
tightest season ever in 1M floor 
hockey as the Manchester 
Pucks Unltd. edged Kaos4·3 
for the AAA championship in 
the teams' third meeting of the 
plaxoffs. 

The Pucks compiled a 3·1 
record during the regular 
seallon and came into the 
e...,layoffs as a slight favorite. 
They bested Is It a Penalty to 
Cum Into Ti e Crease by a 3-1 
score in the opening round of 
the double elimination 
playoffs. 

They moved on to face their 
archrivals of Kaos in the 
second round and narrowly 
oudasted them as ' Robert 
Aka.hi pushed in the deciding 
tally in the third overtime 
period. They then enjoyed a 
well-deserved rest waiting for

the championship round. Kaos 
was forced into playing the 
next night in hopes of getting 
another shot at Manchester. 

It took another triple 
overtime contest to decide who 
faced Manchester in the final 
round as Kaos edged Is It A 
Penalty 4-3. 

The final game truly tested 
Manchester'a spirit as they 
were forced to battle back 
from an early 2·0 deficit. Ron 
Neef and the Puck defenae 
held fast as they worked on a 
faltering !<aos defenae. Goal. 
by Robert Akashi and Joe 
Davis put Manchester ahead 
4-2 with 10 fllinUtes left. 

Kaos netted one final goal 
but was unable to find the 
tieing goal. 

Manchester Pucka looks 
ahead to next year in hopes of 
becoming UCSD's first three 
time champion. Captain Chris 
Armour expects another top-
notch team despite 100ing

Brown Unveils Budget 
CondI ._ from ".". of 

TIwat alternative budget will contain recommendations to cut 
Itate .pendilll in cue voters in June enact the "Jarvis II" 
ntiative, a proposal by Proposition 13 co-author Howard Jarvis 
to cut in h8If the state income tax, currently the state's second 
bigest taxget, and he refused to speculate on what it might 
contain. 

But Davis said it is "very unlikely" Brown would propose any 
new taxes to offset the estimated $5 billion reduction in state 
revenues if Jarvis II i. enacted. 

One budge proposal that faces a stormy future was prompted 
by perhaps the state's most glaring educational problem, the 
decline in reading scores of hitrh school seniors. 

Brown is ~ a $22 million increase, to $157 million, in 
the School Improvement Program, which sets up planning 
counciIa, incIudina parenb, at each school and is suppoaed to 
tIiIor education to each student's needs. 

Totailtale public school funding would be $7.14 billion, an 
increue of $SO 1 miIion or 7.5 p«cenL The s~te is expecting a 
1.1 pen:ent decline in ervohent, to 4.03 million.

North City West Suit 
Coratinued from fHJIe 4 

And while Worden says the 
land east of Del Mar Heights 
won't be "open forever," he is 
confident Del Mar will win 
some kind of victory. 

Del Mar filed suit against 
the City of San Diego in 
October, and is waiting for a 
judge to be appointed to the 
case. 

Worden expects a judge to 
be appointed within a week, 
who will set a hearing date for 
the case. 

Like the coalition, Del Mar 
is seeking improvements in 
San Diego's sewage system. 
Although it has not filed suit on 
those grounda, Del Mar may

me a separate federal suit over 
the current sewage facilities, 
Worden says. 

Worden is also waiting for a 
ruling on a Woodland Hills 
case involving charges of 
conflict of interest among city 
officials. 

The San Diego City 
Council's 6-2 approval of 
North City West was 

influenced by campaign 
contributions from North City 
West developers, according to 
the Del Mar lawsuit. 

If the Woodland Hills case 
is unresolved by the time of a 
ruling on North City West, 
Worden says he may ask the 
court to postpone a decision on 
that part of the suit.
