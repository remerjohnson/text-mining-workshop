LOS ALAMO - The viruses 
that cause AID are mutating up w 
five times faster than any other 
known infectious agent, according

Laborawry

called the human immunodefici-
ency viruses HIV-l and HIV-2. The 
latest results have recently been re-
poned by Myers and his collabor-
awr Temple Smith. of the Dana 
Farber Cancer Institute , to the Na-
tional Centers fo r Disease Control , 
the atlOnal Cancer Institute and 
the Pasteur Institute in Paris. 

"Rapid mutation ratcs raise the 
po sibility that nor only mar a

certain AID ViruS, but also more 
than one vaccine may be needed to 
address the pandemic," Myers aid. 

orne 17 HIV -1 samples collected 

from the United tates and Africa 
from 1983 to 1985 were computer 
analyzed, as were four genetic seg-

men~s of the recently di scovered

evolution of the vlruse .

suggests the AIDS viruses only re-
cently made their evolutionary 
entrance into the niche of hu-
manity. 

"The looming question for us at 
the moment ," said Myers , "is 
whether the viral variation is being 
driven by the epidemic; is the 
extent of mutation a function of the 
number of infected individual ."

Judge Elizabeth N. Zumwalt sa id , 
"I feel there was premeditation 
and note that the victim was 
physically smaller." About Math-
ewson , Zumwalt said, "If he's 
nOt imprisoned he will be a 
danger to Others." . 

Mathewson was arrested (at 
his Thousand Oaks home) Febru-
ary 10 by San Diego Police 
detectives and brought to San 
Diego where he was booked 
into the county jail on murder , 
charges. 

Lam was murdered in a can-

yon o ff of Pomerado Road , in 
the vicini ty of United States 
International University, around 
1'30 am. Nearby reSident heard 
loud noises about this time as 
Lam pn!sumabl}' attempted to 
fight off his ,1SSailant HIS oody 
was dl!>covered around 230 pm 
on the same day 

. Police sa;d the apparent mo-
tive for the kill ing was an argu-
ment over a mutual gi rlfriend. 
Lam and Mathewson , both of 
Thousand Oaks. had been child-
hood friends . 

An autopsy the day after the 
incident confirmed that Lam 
died of gunshOt wounds and 
that the death was a homicide. 
The body was clothed and blood 
was smeared over the victi m's 
face . He had been dead ix to 
eight hours before his body was 
discovered by a pas er-by. 

Lam was enrolled in Warren 
College and was studying 
pre-EECS.

Regents begin 
divestment procedures 

Guidelines have been put in place to 
begin the divestment of Universiry of 
California holdings in companies still do-
ing business in South Africa. In calendar 
year 1988, the dollar value of those South 
Afnca-related holding mu t be reduced 
by no less than o ne-third, under the 
phased divestment policy adopted by the 
UC Board of Regents inJuly 1986. 
Complete divestment is to be 
accomplished by Dec. 31, 1990. 

At the time the policy was adopted in 
July 1986, UCs investment portfolio 
totaled $9.6 billion, with $3.1 billion 
invested in 29 companies then domg 
business in South Africa. The percentage 
of the portfolio invested in companies 
doing business in South Africa has fallen 
from 32 percent to 16 percent in the last 
year, mainly because of the withdrawal of 
11 of those original 29 companie from 
South Afnca, accordmg to Treasurer 
Herbert Gordon. 

Over the next calendar year, it will be 
the Regents' responsibiliry to reduce the 
South African-related share of the 
portfolio by approximately $666 million , 
while doing everything possible to 
mitigate the financial impact of the 
divestment. If any of the 13 current 
holdings leave South Africa during the 
year. the amount of that mvestment will 
be counted toward the reduction. 
Similarily. the decline in market value of 
any of the 13 companies shall count 
agamst the reductipn. 

About $10.6 billion of UCs $12,6 
billion portfolio is made up of retirement 
funds. AnOther $1.2 million is in short-
term mvestments. And the remaining $1 
billion is in endowments, Under the 
guidelines developed by the Regents 
Commiuee on Investments none of the 
endowment funds will be part of the 
first-year of divestment as a precaution 
against legal uncertainties. 

The legal questions revolve around 
whether investment decisions made for 
social reasons rather than purely finan-
cial reasons open the trustees of the fund 
- in this case the Regents - to 

potentialliabiliry. "It is by no means clear 
that div~ent of endowment funds 
ultitnalely would be found unlawful." 
according to UC General CounselJames 
Holst. However, he said, "the 
consequences of potential losses of these 
funds is also more serious since, unlike 
the retirement fund . there is no way to 
make up any loss." Thus. concluded 
Holst, it would be advisable to 
accomplish the first year of the 
divestment program withoUl affecting 
endowment funds and to re-evaluale that 
strategy based on the experience of the 
firs t year. Also, he nOted . it is possible 
the legal question may be clarified during 
this period by sui ts now pending in 
other states. 

Humanities Research Institute 
Planned for UC Irvine 
The Universiry of California has unveiled 
a major academic initiative designed to 
enhance research and graduate edu-
cation in the humanities. The four-part 
program, which includes a 
Universiry-wide Humanities Research 
InstitUle at the UC Irvine ca mpus, is the 
most comprehensive of its type in the 
coumry, according to UC administrators. 
The $35 million intiative was a response 
to UC President David P. Gan.lner's call 
to invigorate the humanities and its 
disciplines in the universiry curriculum. 
"I recognized that the humanities have 
confronted more than their share of 
difficulties in recent years, problems that 
are national, nOt merely institutional. in 
scope, " Gardner said. 

He pointed to a 1980 report by the 
Rockefeller Commission on the 
Humanities, which nOted the decli ning 
quality and funding of humanities educa-
tion and research. And he noted the 
limited external support available for 
research in the humanities, comparing 
the 1987 National Science Foundation 
budget of S 1.6 billion to the $139 million 
budgeted for the National Endowment 
for the Humanities. 

The Universiry of California 
Humanities Initiative includes: 
• A Humanities Research Institute at UC 

Irvine, featuring a group of scholars-in-
residence whu will study humanistic 
themes and publish the proceedings of 
conferences, seminars, and workshops. 
• $800,000 in annual core suppOrt for 
new organized research units in the 
humanities on the eight UC campuses. 
• $800.000 annually to support 
predoctoral humanities fellowships. 

The UC humanities initiative grew 
from the ideas of an ad hoc committee of 
faculry representatives. convened by Pre-
sident Gardner in 1986 and chaired by 
Stanley C hodorow. Dean of Arts and 
Humanities al UC San Diego. 

The Irvine campus was chosen to 
house the Humanities Institute after a 
review of competitive proposals from 
several of the UC campuses. The center 
Will bring together experts within and 
outside the UniverSity community for up 
to a full year, through prOVIsion of partial 
or full salary support. "The institute is a 
unique o pportunity to create a n 
internationally distinguished center for 
scholarly work in the humanities , a mag-
net for the world's leading humanists to 
come and learn from one another and to 
advance our understanding and 
appreCiation of the humanities," Gardner 
said. 

The organized research support in the 
initiative is deSigned to foster major 
campus research activities which might 
potentially develop into Organized 
Research Units (ORUs). President's 
Research Fellows - between 25 and )0 
each year - will receive full funding for 
research projects or supplements to 
national awards. The awards program 
responds to Ihe scarciry of research sup-
port for humanists and the limited size 
of some national awards. The predoctOral 
fellowships are intended to support 
prospective teachers and scholars in the 
humanities. The program is ex pected to 
suppOrt 80 fellows in any given year, 
selected by the campuses. 

Humanities building to 
be named for Nierenberg 

The Regents of the UniverSity of 
California announced Friday, Sept 18, 
they would name a building at UCSD's 
Scripps Insti tution of Oceanography for 
Dr. William A. Nierenberg. professor 
emeritus of oceanography and former 
Scripps Institution director. 

"This is a fitting recognition of 
Professor Nierenberg's 21-year tenure as 
director of Scripps Institution of Oceano-

graphy and his lifelong achievements in 
service to marine science, education, and 
research on national and international 
levels," said Dr. Edward A. Frieman, di -
rector of Scripps Institution. "Through 
his actions, Nierenberg brought the 
institution to the forefront of modern 
science by spearheading innovative pro-
grams, initiating new technologies for 
oceanography, and recruiting 
outstanding faculry and stafr." 

The building named for Nierenberg 
was completed in 1985 and has some 
31.000 square feet of laboratory and 
office s pace that houses research 
programs in physical oceanography. 
climate forecasting, and space sciences. 
Nierenberg was instrumental in planning 
the building and securing the building's 
$4.75 million construction COSt from 
non-state resources. 

Nierenberg was director of Scripps 
Institution and UCSD vice chancellor of 
marine sciences from 1965-1986. Prior to 
joining Scri pps, he was a professor of 
physics at UC Berkeley and the UCs 
lawrence Radiation LaboratOry for IS 
years. He was appointed professor 
emeritus and director emeritus upon his 
retirement in 1986. Nierenberg has a 
long record of national and international 
service, consulting such diverse 
organizations and agencies at NATO , the 
u.s. Navy, the White House, the De-
partment of State, and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 

Engineering programs 
accredited 

Four programs within the division of 
engineering at the University of Califor-
nia, San Diego have rece ived 
accreditation from the Accreditation 
Board for engineering and Technology. 
The four programs to receive 
accreditation are: bioengineering, 
mechnical engi neering, structural engin-
eeri ng, and systems and control 
engineering. 

"Accreditation can be of real value to 
our graduates in their future 
employment," said Dan Olfe, chair of the 
Department of Applied Mechanics and 
Engineering Sciences, "Students who go 
into programs requiring licenSing. such 
as structural or mechanical engineering, 
can take the licensing exam up to rwo 
years earlier if they graduate from an 
accredited program."

TV may not increase 
teenage suicide rate 

By JAMES GILMORE 
SlaffWrila 

TeleVision broadcasts of fictional 
movies about suicide do nOt stimu-
late an increase in teenage sui-
cides, according to a s tudy con-
ducted by UCSD sociologist pro-
fessor Dr. David P. Phillips and 
gradll ~tc student Daniel). Paight. 

The report, published last week 
in the New En~landJournal ofMedi-

York City, Madelyn S. Gould and 
Dr. David Shaffer noted six more 
teen suicides over a two-week per-
iod, respectively, following the tele-
cast of three movies about suicide. 
The two researchers concluded that 
"fictional presentations of suicide 
may have a lethal effect," 

"We wanted to see how the 
numbers compared across the na-
tion ," Phillips said. The Phillips 
and Paight study. which used the 

ted Press International that they no 
longer believe that periodic tele-
vision broadcasts of movies have 
such a widespread impact. "We 
think that the effect might not be as 
general as we originally thought," 
Gould said, "but it's more general 
than just the New York area." 

The results of the Phillips-Paight 
study do not affect those in a 
related report published by Phillips 
and lundie L. Carstensen last year 
in the New En$!landJournal o{Medi-

According to Phillips, the combined data from the two 
studies fails to provide evidence that the television 
broadcast of fictional suicide stories causes an in-
crease in suicides, 
cine, showed that in 1984-85 the 
number of teenage suicides in Cali-
fornia and Pennsylvania decreased 
slightly after the shOWing of three 
movies about sui Cide. The tWO 
researchers have concluded that is 
it premature to be concerned about 
the possible fatal effect of fictional 
televised films about suicide, 

The UCSD study was initiated in 
response to a similar one conducted 
by researchers at Columbia U niver-
siry, which was published last year 
in the New EnglandJournal ofMedi-
cine. 

In that study, conducted in New 

same three movies , was essentially 
a replication of the Columbia study. 
I n order to give the results a more 
credible national applica tion , the 
UCSD sample was five times greater 
than the Columbia sample and 
taken from both ends of the conti-
nent. 

Accor~ing to Phillips, the com-
bined data from the two studies.. 
fails to proVide evidence that the 
television broadcast of fictional sui-
cide stories causes an increase in 
suicides. 

In response to the Phillips-Paight 
study, Gould and Shaffer told Uni-

cine. The study examined the rela-
tion berween 38 nationally televised 
news or feature stories about suicide 
from 1973 to 1979 and the fluctua-
tion of the rate of suicide among 
American teenagers before and after 
those stories. 

The report strongly indicates 
that repeated television news re-
ports and features about suicides 
trigger a Significant rise in teenage 
suicides, and that "the more publi-
ciry the news story receives, the 
greater is the increase in teenage 
suicides."

C.I.A. yes or no? 
Newpapers seeks to inform their readers of current events in an 

attempt ro help them form their opinions on a variety of ropics. Readers 
may be stimulated, bored, enthused or enraged by what they encounter. 
It is not always the ;utic1es and commentaries that elicit a response. 
Sometimes l[ IS the ads. 

[n Monday's issue of the Guardian , an advertisement for the Central 
[ntelligence Agency provoked not only emotional reaction, but physical 
action. (The same ad appears in Hiatus, page 2, today.) Protest 
manifested itself in two forms: in person complaints and petty 
vandalism. 

On Monday night, UCSD police confronted campus activists Andy 
Howard and Arnie Schoenberg as they hid bundles of the Guardian 
behind a dumpster near the Revelle Cafelena. Others took a more 
constructive and direct approach by expressing their distaste for the 
advertisement in person. 

The events of the past few days have rekindled an age old debate 
within the Guardian - whether to accept c.1.A. advertisements or not. As 
it stands, roughly half the edirorial staff feels the Guardian should refuse

conspIracy 
By MATT SMILEY 

When one considers the raging 
political apathy among UCSD's Stu-
dent body, it's surprising to rind 
the diversity of political 'newspa-
pers: propaganda leaflets, and 
speeches originating from a small 
but vocal minority. Of all the campus 
political rags, however, my favorite 
is the California Review. It -attracts 
me in the same way William F. 
Buckley or lhe NatlOllOl EnqUirer 
does, as an entity to entertain , not 
to educate. It screams Mclntellect-
ualism , a SOrt of layman's form of 
political sophistication which sac-
nfices the resources normally de-
voted to substance in an attempt to 
further its appearance by loading 
the text with generiC phrases and 
Icons denoting its apparently ultra-
conservative political affiliation. 

scattered randomly, supposedly to 
alert the reader thal the authors are 
indeed classically educated types 
who employ such language in nor-
mal dIscourse. But the CR is more 
than it appears to be. It serves a 
serious objective very different than 
its appearance of an innocent semi-
quarterly created for the sole pur-
pose of letting young Republicans 
spread the holy gospel of Ronald 
Reagan and check the Communist 
surge among the students and ad-
ministrators But we'll get to thal 
later. after we dissect our laresr 
issue. 

We begin With a sca thing edit-
orial by Kurt Schlicter which out-
lines in a deliberately sarcastic 
manner the good and bad, left and 
right, liberal and conservative ele· 
ments of UCSD and why the good, 
right, and conservative is better. 
He takes a Single paragraph potshot

disgust at our 'wimpy and Silly' 

space, just as any other agency. This country bases its existence on its 
Constitution (although even that has come under some scrupulous 
observation lately) . Our Constitution, especially the first ten am mend-
ments, is what distinguishes us from other political systems around the 
world. The c.1.A. has the right to publish an advertisement in any paper. 
That is the issue here. Not whether the policies of the agency are moral or 
immoral, but the fact that the agency has the right to print material. 

Critics of the preceding mode of reasoning argue as such: as a private 
business, we reserve the right to refuse advertiSing. And the issue of 
morality cannot be ignored. The c.1.A. has violated and is violating 
fundamental human rights around the world . We must acknowledge this 
fact when form ulating advertis ing policy. 

The Guardian strives to be objective in its news and sports coverage. 
The question boils down to: should that objectivity be carried over to the 
advertising department? 
The Guardian urges you to examine this dilemma and let us know where 
you stand. Your opinion is important to us and will help define our 
advertiSing policy.

similar protest movements against 
each other) that Schlicter is pleased 
to see the ASUCSD controlled by 
conservatives and frats , and that 
he is joining the infantry. My advice 
to him would be to seek the compu-
ter engineering field instead, where 
his binary mentality might be ap-
preciated. The Army is too liberal 
these days, and Reagan is toO far in 
the public doghouse to carry out 
anymore of the token wars that 
make the Army an appealing career. 

The next item 01 interest is the 
staff box, which could stand to 
employ the phrase Gluteus Maximus, 
particularly in the editors' quarter. 
After thiS, it's downhill, with peti-
tions for the Reagan Library at 
UCSD (Three Rambo colOring books 
and the complete Jo~n Wayne 
video collection), several Red-Scare 
pieces and an appeal to the Left for 
more diverse insults. After Admiral 
Stockdale's war stories comes an 
essay that sacrifices even Reagan 
in the interest of cheap, overseas 
labor. a proclamatio!" that God is a 
Republican, and finally an impartial 
grading ofUCSD's radical left-wing 
faculty . 

Typical of amateur attempts to 
emulate Bill Buckley? Not really. 
Because the CR slipped this timr 
on page IS , where they placed a 
picture of editor Justina Flavin at 
the birthplace of her favorite Amer-
ican president - the 'defender of 
freedom' - Richard M. Nixon. 
Though the rest of the paper is 
quite ridiculous, nothing it has 
ever published even approaches 
this. And it is this alone that proves 
what I have suspected for quite a 
while: The CR is a Communist con-
spiracy to destroy the conservatives 
on campus. 

It's a triple encoded maneuver 
previously employed by a select 
few in the televangelism business. 
But what Jim and Tammy Bakker 
did to the Christian faith, the CR is 
doing to the local right-wingers by 
attempting to portray the typical 
conservative students as Coors-
guzzling, cross-burning McCarthy-
ists that seek to trample every 
element of our society in an attempt 
to defeat the cancerous spread of 
Communism and preserve the pro-
fits of the defense industry. When 
one re-reads the paper with that 
thought in mind it becomes clear 
that each and every article attempts 
to establish its wri ter as a card-
carryi ng lunatic who deliberately 
overloads his social commentary 
with enough racist and sexist state-
ments to make Ad(Jlf Hitler cri nge. 

Now I'm sony ifl ruined anyone's 
day by leui ng t he cat out of the bag. 
But no matter how evil the conserv-
ative cause is, it does n't deserve the 
CR. The CR should be preserved, 
however, because when read prop-
erly, it's funnier than the Koala.

Old frog is cause of a new theory 
BERKELEY - Nature's best preservative 

has kept a tiny Caribbean tree frog intact for 
nearly 40 million years, scientists reported 
recently. 

The inch-long frog is the first documented 
find of an ancient amphibian embedded in 
amber and one of only three fossil vertebrates 
yet found so well preserved, the researchers 
said. 

Discovered last year by a local worker in a 
subterranean amber mine in the mountains 
of the Dominican Republic, the preserved 
frog provides a valuable clue (0 how and 
when animals arrived in the Caribbean 
region. It is also the oldest complete frog 
fossil found in Mesoa merica - the region 
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. 

Two scientists at the University of Calif or-
nia, Berkeley described the rare find in a 
recent issue of the journal Scitnct. 

The two are George O. POinar,Jr., lecturer 
and insect pathologist at UC Berkeley, and 
David C. CannatelIa, a post-doctoral researcher 
at Berkeley'S Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. 

The frog, along with two lizards and 
insects found earlier in other Dominican 

Republic amber samples, reveal that 40 
million years ago, the Caribbean region 
already had a far more diverse animal 
population than had been suspected , the 
scientists reponed. 

Land movements in the region are thought 
to have formed the island of Hispaniola -
which now includes Haiti and the Domin-
ican Republic - some 20 million years ago. 

Since the frog dates back nearly 20 
million years before this, it provides strong 
evidence that a diverSity of animals thrived 
on the land mass long before the Caribbean 
islands were formed by great movements of 
earth plates from both North and South 
America into the Caribbean region. 

The finding casts doubt on the competing 
view of the timing and mode of animal 
dispersal. This view suggest that many major 
animal groups were not present on what is 
now Hispaniola until the island was in its 
present location. Then, so the ar-gument 
goes, animals colonized the isla nd princi-
pally by "sailing in" on drifting debris or on 
wind currents.

"What we've found is that in 

many land disposal areas the 
ground and groundwater have been 
polluted by these dissolved organ-
ics, and steps are now being taken 
to help contain them." 

Companies now realize that their 
property can result in a hazard to 
water supplies far from the si te and 
must ensure that the contaminated 
water does not leave their property 
lines. 

[n most cases, ex tensive field 
research is needed to determine 
the best method for containment. 
Dougherty'S computer progra m, 
which is expected to be completed 
in the summer of 1988, will allow 
scientists (0 predict the movement 
of groundwater contaminants and 
test a variety of methods for con-
tainment all on the computer 
screen. 

It also can be used with other 
programs to give time frames and 
costs for each solution tested. 

"The program is intended for

becuase it requires a great deal of 
scientific input, unlike a know-
ledge-based expert system that 
queries the user in Simpler terms," 
said Dougherty.

A.S. has th students vote 

From campus cafe to University Center 

Evan Weisenfe ld encourages student input at week ly A,S, meetings. 

By KATHLEEN GARVEY 
Staff WritD' 

. As an undergraduate at UCSD, 
chances are you have (or at least 
will) come into contact with the 
Associated Students (A.S.). The 
A UCSD Council is the governing 
body and "voice" of undergrad-
uates, 

The $13.50 activity fee that stu-
de nts pay each quarter funds the 
A.S., along with the profits A.S, 
makes from its many service organ i-
zations, The budget planning com-
mi ttee, which meets each spring, 
helps allocate th is money to a wide 
range of student organizations. 
KSDT, the Grove Caffe, Soft Re-
serves and Assorted Vi nyl are just a 
few of the AS-sponsored enter-
prises on campus, 

Consisting of officers, commis-
sioners, student senators and ex-
officio members, A.S, works closely 
with the admin istration , Academic 

A.S. President Dave Marchick Senate and the UC Regents to 
at work on T.A. training progra m, collectively decide the po\tcies and 

prances of the un iversity, The six 
com miss ioners and 10 senators 
(one from each class at eac h college) 
make up the 22 voting members of 
the AS Council. The pres ident 
and vice presidents do not vote, 
nor do the ex-offi cio members, 
which incl udes the jud icial chair 
and student advocate , In the event 
of a ti e-vote , the chair casts the 
decidi ng vote. 

AS represe ntatives are present 
at many decision-making meeti ngs 
in o rder to ensure discussion of 
student needs. The AS even has a 
lobby - an annex whose members 
mai ntai n contact wi th state legiS-
lators, This past summer, A.5. mem-
bers travelled 10 Sacramento and 
discussed stud ent issues with San 
Diego assemblymen. 

Accord ing 10 Dave Marchick, a 
member of A. , for two years and 
now serving as president, "it's really 
easy for students to ge t involved." 
Evan Weisenfeld, comm issioner of 
the new university center, agrees: 
"A.5. holds a weekly Wednesday 
student input meeting at 6:30 pm, 
where any student can speak on 
any issue o r approach an A.S. 
member." Or, one can just drop by 
the A.S, offi ce on the second floor 
o f the student center 10 find out 
about volunteer opportunities. Help 
is always needed with the planning 
and directing o f the various organi-
zations; students may even try to 
start one of their own, An open 
pos ition on the AS Council itself 
is that of financial controller, an 
important student position. Stu-
dents interested in becoming part 
of the A.S. council should drop by 
their offi ce for more information,

ahead of time." The center, which 
will include a Wendy's restaurant,

conveniences, "should be full y op-

erational by the beginning of 1989," 
Weisenfeld said. The A.S. had a 
hand in making every decision 
concerning the new center, and,

The center proVides a host of

In add Ition to free clin ical services, 
St. Vi ncent's provides breakfast to 
the street people and works with 
the San Diego Cathohc Worker at 
the Soup Kitchen, where 500-700 
lunches are served as well as 200 
dinners da ily. 

The new center, which expands 
current services. is the "only one in

vices) for the homeless an d the 
street people," Sister Fay, a volunteer 
co-ord inator said . The free cli nics.

take." The homeless are referred to 
the center by one of75 community 
based emerge ncy agencies, who 
then p roVIde further case manage-
ment for these referrals. Although 
there's a constant turnover of beds, 
the only waiting list is for Single 
males because of the great percent-
age of men on the streets.

individuals to help those on the 
streets become productive members 
of society, It's this no frills approach 
to address ing the p roble ms of the 
homeless which gives Father Joe 
his unexpected de manding edge , 

"I don't think anyone knows the 
root of the problem (of homeless-
ness)," he says, "So what do you do 
in the meanwhile? Tell them to live 
in the street, while we do 20 years 
of research to find out why they' re 
there? The guy's dead in 20 years!" 

Breaking the cycle of poverty is 
the main concept behind St. Vin-
cent's church which opened in San 
Diego in the 1950s, FatherJoe, who 
became head in 1982, explained, 
"Shelters for the homeless should 
be what I call a 'total emergency 
center', everything on the same 
grounds that you baSically find all 
the things that people need to 
break the cycle of poverty. Secondly, 
(this) can be done in a beautiful 
setting so we wanted to build a 
building so that people would feel 
good about themselves." 

A pragmatist , FatherJoe says the 
immediate needs of the homeless 
should be satisfied first , and then 
research could be conducted to 
find the roots of poverty and a 
transitory lifestyle. "Other guys can 
look for root causes," Father Joe 
said, "The bottom line is Adam and 
Eve got kicked out of the Garden. 
(God) was the first landlord to kick 
people out. So, 1 mean, you've 
always had homeless. You always 
will," For research purposes, shel-
ters can help by identifyingpopula-
tion of homeless, he added. 

FatherJoe doesn't believe in free 
rides. The maximum stay at the 
shelter is 30 days. Each resident 
must help out th e ce nter and obey 
their rules. "If they don't they get 
kicked OUI. I stress we don't have 
second chances in our program," 
he says , "We're your last chance. In 
other words, I say, 'God forgives, I 
don't'. They've got to do it them-
selves (that' s) the boltom line." 

Exposing some of the myths 
concerning San Diego's homeless, 
FatherJoe asserted that 0.5 percent 
of every city's population is home-
less and San Diego doesn't have 
any more than any other city. "I 
don't think there's any great boom 
in the homeless out here. I think 
there's a great boom in the (popula-
tion of San Diego) and because of 
that, a certain percentage don't get 
the job they hope for ," 

Volunteers and interns playa 
large role in prOViding for the 
homeless of San Diego through the 
programs set up by the SI. Vincent 
de Paul-Joan Kroc Center. Accord-
ing to the center's 1985 Annual Re-
pon, the estimated contributed ser-
vices of the volunteers exceeds 
5150,000 annually. Volunteers assist 
in a number of ways, Some act as 
counselors, child care workers, typ-
ists, and carpenters. Professionals 
such as doctors, nurses, computer 
operators, and teachers also offer 
their time and skills. If interested 
in helping out , please contact Mar-
got Howard, the St. Vincent de Paul 
volunteer co-ordinator at 233-8500 
or the Volunteer Connection at 
UCSD for further information,

year "has never had an issue over-
turned." 

Also o n the A.5, agenda for the 
school term 1987-88 is a plan to 
implement stronger T.A. trai ning 
programs in order to overcome stu-
dent/ teacher commun ication bar-
riers. Marchick stresses its impor-
tance "since students interact most-
ly with their TA's, ~specially at the 
undergraduate level." Also in the 
works are a proposed 24-hour study 
han at HL and an increase in the 
number of classes offering lecture 
notes The parking shuttle which 
was recently implemented to ease 
the problem of student parking is 
one of the more recent AS suc-
cesses. 

Some past successes of A.5. in-
clude the Grove Cafe, wh Ich Weis-
enfeld calls "the most successful 
enterprise ever I at UCSD 1, because 
it serves good food at a good price." 

Last spring the Student Affirma-
tive Action Committee (SAAC) bar-
gained for badly needed funding. 
The fact they they got it is an 
example of how students really do 
have a say in how their money is 
allocated on campus. 

Both Marchick and Weisenfeld 
hope to get more student input this 
year. It is "the best way to get 
something you want done, done." 
Weisenfeld remarked. 

Many times, students express 
dissatisfaction with A.5. and with 
what it does or doesn't do for 
UCSD. According to Weisenfeld, 
"A.5. does a good job and the best 
they can, but we can do better if we 
hear from the students more."

Theme parties break out of toga rut 
~r_",:r_ 

By ROBERT LEONE 
SlajJWnter 

Unfortu nately, toga parties become the inevitable fate of many 
UCSD students. They are in fl icted by parry-givers who consider the 
unsuitable use of d irty linen more important than imagination when 
planning a theme party. 

Even television show theme parties, ranging from "Dallas" to 
"Dragnet: would be an improvement. The sequined cocktail dresses 
and tacky chrome tie clasps will appreciate coming out of the closet. 
Better yet, use both themes for one party and have]oe Friday arrestJR. 

Oldtimers might want an "Avengers" party (lots of derbys , umbrellas, 
and black leather) , a "Mission Impossible" or even a "Leave it to 
Beaver" party. For the young at heart (or immature) there's always 
"Sesame Street." 

Movie marathons, thanks to the miracle of VCRs, are a simple way 10 
keep guests tranquilized. People don't dance during movies , except 
''The Rocky Horror Picture Show," whic h isn't legally available on 
videotape. Clint Eastwood and Harrison Ford film festivals should 
easily keep partygoers Sitting down and munching food all night. 

If you're politically minded, the "Gary Hart-Donna Rice Weddi ng" 
will draw some chuckles, and maybe even guests, if you have enough 
cake. "Oliver North for President" is another tastelass possibiliry. The 

more unwieldy "Diversion of Iran ian Funds to the Contras Hearings" 
might merely produce a crowd of olive- drab attired people who want 
10 tell you about th is "really neat idea" and "the good, the bad , and the 
ugly." 

'T he Communist Party" is always good, if you want an excuse to 
paint the dorm red. 

A "Pearlygates Party" would be worthless without someone imperson -
ating Brother Jed Smock, UCSD's favorite evangelist. Can anyone 
reproduce Tammy Fae Baker's makeup? (Why does she have the same 
facial bone structure as Imelda Marcos? Is there a lesson to be learned 
here?) 

"Red Light District" parties are always SOcially acceptable for fishnet 
slOckings and displays ofhulging arm muscles, or perhaps "Safe Sex" 
could be a party theme. 

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" is the title of a comic book series, 
and could make a great party theme. No one will know what it means, it 
encompasses almost all possible costume ideas one could th ink up. 

"The UCSD Policemen's Ball" could get you into trouble if you don't 
card everybody. It's also a good excuse 10 ge t out the ol']ack Webb suit 
again. 

And what if you threw a party and nobody came1 
But, if you pay anentlon 10 the basics of theme parties, there should 

be fun had by all , except, of course, by those who have to clean up "The 
Day After." 

BeforeJOU choose al~ distance 
service, take a close lOOK. 

You may be thinking about 
choosing one of the newer 
carriers over AT&T in order to 
save money. 

Think again. 
Since January 1987, AT&TS 

rates have dropped more than 
15% for direct-dialed oot-of-
state calls. So they're lower than 
you probably realize, For infor-
mation on specific rates, you 
can call us at 1 800 222-0300, 

And AT&T offers clear long 
distance connections, operator 
assistance, 24-hour customer 
service, and immediate credit 
for wrong numbers. Plus, you 
can use AT&T to call from 
anywhere to anywhere, all over 
the United States and to O\oef 
250 countries. 

You might be surprised at 
how good a value AT&T really 
is. So before you choose a 
long distance company; pick 
up the phone.

UCR - Scientists at the Uni-
versityofCalifomia, Riverside have 
patented a new process to genetic-
ally engineer recombinant bacteria 
which clean up chemical waste, 
The process has the potential to 
create microorganisms capable of 
degrading toxic polychlorinated bi-
phenyls (PCBs), a major health and 
environmental hazard. 

The bacteria the UCR scientists 
engineered degrade chemical waste 
because they use the carbon-con-
raining compounds as food sources 
and later excrete byproducts harm- binant. ,-------------------------

The Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) estimates it will take 
decades and COSt over $90 billion 
to clean up cancer-causing PCBs 
and other IOxins in the nation's 
worst dump sites. If the recombi-
nant bacteria engineered at UCR 
can be scaled up to commercial 
production, cleanup could occur 
in a mailer of weeks in the near 
future .

binant DNA success StOry. We

Up to $20 million a year in home 
loans will be available to eligible 
faculty members under the Univer-
sity of California's increasingly suc-
cessful Mortgage Origination Pro-
gram. The funding - increased 
from the $15 million a year that 
had funded the program since it 
began in 1984 - was approved 
today by the UC Board of Regents. 

"The goal of this particular pro-
gram is to recruit and retain key 
professors," said Steven Mathews, 
director of faculty housing pro-
grams. "From the beginning results 
have shown the program to be 
successful in meeting that goal . 
and we expect the program to be 
increasingly effective." 

The program . one of three de-
Signed to help UC faculty members 
buy new homes, is funded from 
unrestricted portions ofUC's Short 
Term Investment Pool (STlP). The 
program offers first deed-of- trust 
mortgage loans at below-market 
interest rates indexed to the four-
quarter average rate of return for 
the STlP. In addition, the program 
helps defray home-buying COStS by. 
charging no points or application 
fees and by paying many of the 
closing costs associated with home 
financing. 

Mathews said the UC program 
also offers liberal underwriting of 
loans, allowing borrowers to allocate 
up to 40 percent of their income 
toward loan payments. To be eligi-
ble, faculty members must be nom-
inated forthe loan program through 
their depanment. 

From its stan inJuly 1984 through 
June 30, 1987, the program had 
received 232 loan applications, rep, 
resenting a total worth of nearly 
$39 million. Of the total applica-
tions received, 213 loans have been 
funded and have closed . 

All UC campuses are represented 
among applicants , Mathews said, 
with newly recruited faculty mem-
bers accounting for about 72 per, 
cent of applicants. Nearly 47 per-
cent of applicants were professors, 
almost 20 percent were associate 
professors and about 29 percent 
were assistant professors. 

The average loan amount 
$168,099, which is 12 percent 
more than the $150,000 average 
originally envisioned for the pro-
gram. The average sales pri ce for 
homes purchased under the pro-
gram is $246,959. Based on a new 
average loan amount of $170,000, 
coupled with the $20 million yearly 
funding , the program could pro-
vide approximately 118 loan!\ a 
year. Mathews said. 

In a related matter, Mathews 
noted that the in terst rale on mort-
gage loans in another UC program 
for faculty members has been re-
duced to 7.95 percent from 9.5 
percent. 

The Faculty Morrgage Revenue 
Bond Loan Program, which hegan 
in 1985. IS finan cd through tax-
free bonds and offers fixed-rate 
loans 10 eligihle fa ulty memhers 
Mathews said more than ';20 mil-
Iton is available at the 7.95 Interest 
rate.

UCSD beats Point Lorna 
Tritons stop 
scoring drought 
with 3-1 win 

By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

UCSD's men's soccer team final-
ly came out of their scoring slump 
as they defeated Point Lorna Naza-
rene CoUege 3-1 in fron of 100 + 
spectators Wednesday. 

"We're playing well: remarked 
Triton coach Derek Armstrong. "We 
are JUSt having trouble capitaliZing 
on opportunities offensively. But 
we're getting there." 

The Tritons, now 4-3-2, had 
been unable to score 10 their pre-
VIOUS twO games. 10 109 1-0 to both 
Biola University last Frida)' and 
UC Irvine on Sunday, but flour-
ished yesterday 10 score three . This 
consistent failure to put the ball 
into the net caused the team to fall 
from the eM top 20 after being 
ranked 5th in pre-season polls 

Triton midfielder, sophomore Pi-
eter Koopman, scored the first goal 
20 minutes mro the game from 
nearly half-field. What looked Itke 
a possible ce nter sailed over Point 
Loma's goalie and into the net 

Eleven minutes later, a wlde-
open Scott Goodman capi talized 
on a perfect pass from fullback 
Johnfar Kerlee to give UCSD a 2-0 
lead at the half. 

Ten mmutes intO the second 
half, the Tritons were called for 
tripping in the goalie's box and 
allowed Point Lorna's SCOtt Law-
rence to score his team's first goal 
off the ensuing penalty kick. 

No. 11, Scott Rommel, misjudges a head shot aga inst Occidental. 
Missed opportunities like these have led to Triton defeats. 

The Tritons recovered to score 
once more. Sophomore forward 
Carrick Brewster stole the ball from 
a hot-dogging Carl de Ctutiis of 
Point Lorna and booled a long pass 
to junior forward Mike Dingwall, 
who scooted past his defender for 

the third Tmon goal. 
Before the game, the Tritons had 

scored only one goal in their past 
four games. But to Coach Arm-
strong, one goal is all it takes. 
"What we have to do is keep them 
(the opposition) from scoring on 
our end. In order to do that , we 

Success bac k Eas t 

need good concentration on the 
field and some good team work." 

The Tritons hit the road Thurs-
day for a game against Cal Lut heran 
up in Thousand Oaks. Their next 
home game will be Wednesday, 
October 7 against Cal State San 
Bernardino. 

Water polo goes 4-1 
The UCSD Water Polo team Im-

proved its overall record to 8-4 
after a successful road tn p back 
Easl last week. The Tmons, ranked 
11 th in the latest national coaches' 
poll, went 4-1 , their only loss com-

ing against avy in overtime. 
UCSD began the eastern series 

by walking over Harvard University, 
winning 22-3. The followmg week-
end, the Tntons began competition 
in the Brown University Invita-

Trilon goalie Randy Franke has 100 saves on the year already. 

tional , defeating their host 11-7, 
Bucknell 13-7. lona J 2-8. Navy 
scored three goals in overtime to 
hand the Tnrons their only set 
back, J 1-9. . 

While disappointed with the 
outcome of the game against Navy, 
Triton coach Denny Harper was 
pleased with his team's perform-
ance throughout the trip. 

"Anytime you can go back East 
and win conSistently, you're domg 
well , .. Harper said "We were hop-
mg to go undefeated on the trip . 
bUI we'll settle for a 4-1 record."

Com mentary-

Pennant fever 
By MATT STEUERWALT 

This last Monday, the 28th, 
was quite a day in th is year's 
baseball season. Both western 
d ivision ti tles were decided. you 
hadn't heard? Well, the race is 
over. 

Who won ? Somhern Cali for-
nians don't seem to care. 

Gotta love those kids. The 
Giallls took the NL West by 
about 60 games from a fast-
sinkmg field of some pretty 
miserable teams the rest of this 
diVISion belongs 'in M ball , or 
better yet, Japan , where they 
won't be all over the T.V. Con-
gratulations to San Francisco for 
winning more than they have 
lost. By comparison, MinnesOta 
would be 11 backofToronto, in 
5th place, if they played in the 
AL East. 

I'm not trying to take any-
thing away from what either of 
these teams has done. They are 
in the playoffs , which is more 
than my team can do. It's just 
hard to get hyped for someone 
else, especially someone tough 
to identify with. I'm a baseball 
nut, but even I don't get very 
eXCiled abou t the prospect of a 
San Francisco-Minnesota series. 
So 1 thought some of you more 
laid back fans might be a li ttle 
confused about who to root for. 

Toronto and St. Louis will win 
the Eastern d ivision s. But as 
most of us are from out west, it 
will be even harder to cheer for 
one of those teams. Let's just 
hope they lose in the playoffs 
and leave us with the Twins and 
the Giants . 

Who are the Twi ns? Old-
timers are the only people who 
can remember a Twin pennant; 
it has bee n 17 years. That was 
when Rod Carew was a second-
baseman (yes, he actually played 
the held) winning Gold Glove 
and batting tides . The Twins 
also had a bIg guy named Tony 
OlJv3 hitting behind Carew, now 
he's m the Hall of Fame. Younger 
Southern Californta fans will 
recognize the Twins for twO 
reasons, the first is of course 
Carew. Even though Wally Joy-
ner IS good, Carew was the 
Calt fo rnia Angel's first basc-
man / DH for a while, and he was 
good. The second reason is Ken 
Landreaux . 

In 1981 , Kenny had 3 3 1-
game hitting streak for Minne-

SOla. In 1982, he put on a Los 
Angeles Dodger uniform. and 
hasn't hit in 31 games since. 
Well. maybe he has. but boy is 
he a lousy player. This would 
make me th ink all the Dodger 
fa ns would be rooting against 
the Twins, except the Dodgers 
and Giants have been rivals 
si nce WW11. 

If you call your grandfather 
(or mine, since he's born and 
bred in New York). he can tell 
you great stories about the old 
Brooklyn Dodger-New York 
Giani years. Then bOlh teams 
moved west and renewed Ihe 
fight. The last time the Giants 
won the division was in 1971 . 
Mays. McCovey and Marichal all 
had great years. But the Dodgers 
have come back to go to the 
Series five or six times since, 
wh ile the Giants have sunk to 
deeper depths. 

However, they finally did two 
smart thi ngs in the same year: 
first they lost 100 games in 
J 985, then they hired Roger 
Craig as manager and conned 
[he Dodgers into trading Candy 
Maldanado to them for Alex 
Trevino. Now Trevino is almost 
as bad as Ken Landreaux. The 
Candyman has had twO real 
good years in a row and Roger 
Craig is one of the best managers 
around. 

T he teams are very similar, 
.)oth have man agers (Craig for 
the Giants, Tom Kelly with the 
Tw ins) who have lOIS of baseball 
experience withom being caught 
in the past. 

Both teams hit tons of home 
runs , score lots of runs. give up 
lots and generally play good 
baseball. Watch Kirby Puckett, 
Gary Gaeui , and Kent Hrbek 
from MinneSOla and keep your 
other eye on Will Clark, Maldo-
nado and Chili Davis of San 
Francisco. 

If you are a Giants or a Twins 
fan you'll have no trouble getting 
excited for this series. If you are 
a baseball addict (you watch the 
Braves on cable and read every 
single box score), you'll find a 
way to get excited. Everyone 
else will just have to try a litt le 
harder. 

But if you can't get into the 
mood , you can always do what 
these twO teams have been do-
ing for a lo-ng, long time. 

Wall until next year.

A common sight lately has been striking NFL players on 

television crying about the "gutless scabs" who are undermining the 
efforts of their union. The replacements, they claim, should 
sacrifice a final opponunity to earn money in professional footba ll 
for the sake of the oppressed. 

Eve n when it comes to honoring picket lines, however, some 
sacrifices are obviously too great. As ticket sellers were picketi ng a 
concert last week in St. Louis, several of the real Cardinals were 
watching the show. Let's hope that the music soothes those savage 
beasts back onto the football field , 

From the Quotebook. " 
Kansas City Royal outfi elder Willie Wilson , after hearing 

teammate Bo Jackson's plans to play football as an off-season 
hobby: "Do you think Lawrence Taylor is going to think it's a 
hobby?" 

"Son, looks to me like you're spending too much time on one

Redefining 'real' relationships 

by susie beel 
allOC:iate am editor 

In what direction is the insti, 
tution of marriage going? Is it 
evolving and developing new 
rules, making infidelity the 
rule instead of the exception? 
Tom Stoppard's play, "The 
Real Thing," explores the 
boundaries of marriage and 
the nuances of relationships. 
The play, which won the Tony 
award in 1984, takes us 
through the life of a playwright 
and his struggle with the vari, 
ous relationships in hiS life. 
Using the technique of pre' 
senting a play within a play, 
Stoppard portrays the "paral, 
leis and perpendiculars be, 
tween art and reality." 

Henry is the playwright 
whose love of words and cyni, 
cal wit are a barrier he uses to 
protect himself from the con' 
fusion that love creates. It is a 
barrier which is eventually bro-
ken down by his second wife, 
an actress who i!l an idealistic 
free spirit. She teaches him 
that selfishness is not appro-
priate in a satisfying marriage. 

The opening scene of " The 
.eal Thing" is a scene from 

Susanna Thompson and Pawl Nolan SlaT as {ather and dawghrer. 

Henry's play that is currently 
running. It is an episode which 
is replayed many times by the 
characters in "The Real 
Thing," - a scene of confron-
tation between husband and 
wife, after disloyalty is dis--
covered. Henry's current wife, 
Charlotte, has one of the star, 
ring roles, and, though Henry 
is married to Charlotte, he is 
having an affair with Annie. 
They are discovered by Annie's 
husband Max, and eventually 
Henry and Annie tie the knot, 
both for the second time. Yet 
before the end of the play, 
Henry has his suspicions regard-
ing Anme's devotion to their 
weddmg vows. 

Henry 's first wife Charlotte 
tries to explain to him that he 
really is old fashioned; she 
calls him a virgin to the ways 
of the world of marriage. Ac-
cording to Charlotte, marriage 
is not a commitment made 
only oncej it is a bargain that 
needs to be made over again 
each day. By keeping his shield 
of cymcism up and not voicing 
care and concern, he is letting 
down his end of the bargain. 

Henry, desperately in love 
with Annie, is tryinl! to keep 

his marriage with her together. 
When Annie pleads with him 
to rewrite a play that she wishes 
to produce, by a jailed sol-
dier/arsonist, he complies 
even though itgoes ·against his 
moral dictates. Yet, when 
Annie is away performing in 
an out of town play, she has an 
affair with a young actor. 
When Henry confronts her, 
she confesses, and Henry is 
forced to accept her disloyalty 
and move on. 

In this odd portrayal of a 
"free love" marriage, infidelity 
appears to be par for the 
course. The question raised is 
who is being more selfish-
Henry, for expecting his wife 
to be faithful to him in body 
and spirit, or Annie, for ex-
pecting Henry to find a part of 
himself that doesn't care when 
she is unfaithful? Annie justi, 
fies her actions and her love 
for Henry by telling him she is 
with him because she wants to 
be with him, not because she 
hal to be with him. With that 
Itatement, she tells Henry that 
he must be satisfied with that 
fact alone, and it must be 
enough to prove her love for 
him. 

Tom Stoppard displays all 
his wit and linguisti'c skill in 
this play where word games 
are continually being lost and 
won. And what more fitting a 
character with which to display 
this wit than a playwright 
whose love of words causes 
him to be a high,minded snob. 
The continual references to 
beliefs that sound right but are 
not, and beliefs that sound 
like rubbish, but are really 
right, are enough to stimulate 
anyone into pondering the philo-
sophical questions about mor, 
als and beliefs. In a lengthy 
discussion with Annie, Henry 
explains why he thinks words 
are so important. "I don't 
think writers are sacred, but 
words are. If you get the right 

Inside:' 

ones in the right order, you 
can nudge the world a little or 
make a poem which children 
will speak for you when you're 
dead." 

Paul Nolan gives a fine per-
formance as Henry, changing 
from a cynical and flippant wi t 
to a man deeply in love and 
trying to learn the proper way 
to nurture a faltering relation-
ship. 0' Ann Paton is fascinat-
ing as the ex-wife who shows a 
surprislng amount of understand-
ing towards her ex-husband 
by trying to enlight~n him to 
the ways of the world as well 
as recognizing her own faults 
in regard to their failed mar-
riage. D.B. Novak is also a 
very good Max, Annie's pitiful

The artwork of Randy Ortner will be displayed at the 
Hanson Galleries of La Jolla until October 25. The exhibi-
tion includes a display of 20 original oil paintings of 
coastal landscapes, including one of the La Jolla coast 
called, appropriately, 'La Jolla,' and painted from his 
Muirlands studio overlooking the local waters. 

Ortner uses the technique of creating light - 'chiaro-
scuro' - to add life to his paintings. The technique is 
achieved by using thin, transparent layers of paint which 
light shines through, and reflects off the white canvas 
towards the viewer, creating a luminous effect.

Too Close 

for comfort 
by phil maclovern 

ltaff writer 

With movie tickets costing 
$5.50 a piece, most people 
expect two solid hours of en-
tertainment. This is why the 
new movie "Fatal Attraction" 
is such a let down. It drags you 
through more than an hour 
and a half to give you a solid 
10 minutes of good fast-paced 
action and suspense.

Pursuing 
success 

by david forman 
It.ff writer 

When I came to UCSD in 
the fall of 1983, the word 
around campus was of a local 
band that was causing a fuss 
around the local music circuit. 
It wasn't until a year later, 
however, that I heard The 
Beat Farmers' first album, 
"Tales of the New West." It 
was an inspiring collection of 
tunes which ranged from "kick 
ass" rock and roll to country 
lunacy. A roommate informed 
me that it was their live shows 
that separated The Beat Farm-
ers from other bands. I went 
to see them at the Bacchanal, 
and interviewed them for a 
local entertainment magazine. 
In that initial review in 1986, I 
wrote, "They are sometimes 
unorganized, most of the time 
untamed, and nearly always 
uncalled for, but they make 
for the most consistently ori-
ginal and exciting new South-
ern California band to hit the 
music scene since Los Lobos 
emerged from Los Angeles." 

Over the past two years The 
Beat Farmers have seen an in-
crease in their popularity. Last. 
June, they closed the year at 
UCSO with a rousing T.G.I.O., 
with people crowding the 
walkway in front of the gym 
steps, dancing. 

Shortly after this appear-
ance, their latest album, "The 
Pursuit of Happiness," was 
released-by far their most 
sophisticated album to date. 

The album is pure rock and 
roll with only one novelty 
song (Country Dick's send up 
ofJohnny Cash's "Big River") 
tagged on at the end. The 
songs are well produced and 
well written, but, more impor-
tantly, they show signs of a 
band growing up. The album's 
lead song, "Hollywood Hills," 
written by long time collabora-
tor Paul Kamanski, speaks of 
the quest taken on by the 
band: "We gave up our youth/ 
and model railroad trains/ 
Picked up guitars and / we

wife is out of town. Alex, to be 
rather blunt, is completely psy~ 
chotic, and she can't handle 
the lack of commitment that 
the interlude provides. As a 
result, she haunts Dan's family. 

While it seems to be a good 
story line, something is miss-
ing. It could have been either 
an interesting psychological 
thriller or a compelling drama-
adventure, but "Fatal Attrac-
tion" flounders somewhere in 
between the two. 

This surely is not the fault 
of the actors, both of which 
do very commendable jobs,

of " Rosie, "a Tom Waits song paid at the Bacchanal, the show 
which he sings beautifully, 
backed only by an acoustic 
guitar. Without a doubt Harris 
delivers the depth that was 
missing in the earlier albums. 

Jerry Raney has also devel-
oped as a song writer , as he 
and his writing partner Steve 
Marshall contribute three 
songs, and Raney contributes 
an additional song himself. 
The first single off the album 
" Dark Light," ranks among 
the ir best songs , though 
Raney 'S most interesting song 
on the album is " Key to the

be overstating h is own im-
portance, he takes a stro ng 
stab at independence and a 
serious shot a t uccess. He 
sings, "Lemme go an inch too

music in review 

reminded me of the fi rst t ime I 
aw them . They were fresh , 

and the atmosphere was fes-
tive, not d estructive. They 
seemed ready to face the future; 
to face today . They recently 
opened for Stevie Ray Vaughn 
at the SDSU Open Air Amphi-
theater, and that show received 
similar praise. Sometime early 

this yea r they must have gone 
on their o wn pursuit of happi-
ness, and, if their music is any 
indication, they have found it . 

Now that The Beat Farmers 
are moving on to wider hor-
izons, let's hope that they don't 
forget that they first planted 
their roots and were cultivated 
right here in San Diego. 

One of the main reasons for 
the success of "The Pursuit of 
Happiness " is Harris, who re-
placed Bud dy Blue as lead 
guitarist and vocalist in Feb-
ruary of 1986. He contributed 
four songs to the new album, 
and has added a lyrical and 
musical eleme nt t hat has 
rubbed off on the other mem-
bers of the band. Besides 
"Make it Last," Harris con-
tributed "Rid in" and "Texas," 
both of which had been long 
time concert faVOrites before 
appearing on the album . Hi 
most interesting contr ibution 
IS "God is Here Tonight,' 
leading off the second side. 
This testimony to faith would 
have seemed horribly out of 
place on any of the other Beat 
Farmers' albums, but it fits 
here as is demonstrated in the 
following lyrics: "Like all good 

Though their mater ial is 
more serious on " The Pursuit 
of Happiness" than on their 
previous albums , that does The Bear Farmers - Jerry Raney, Rolle Uwe, Joey Harris, Country Dick Monr.ana.

A Hellraising experience 
by phil macKovern 

Itaff writer 
show him the ultimate in plea-
sure and pain. His remains are 
under the floor boards of an 
old house, where his ex-lover 
and her new husband move in. 
The husband bleeds onto the 
floor, which causes the man to 
regenerate . This is done with 
great special effects. He returns 
and gets his lover to kill, and 
the blood becomes 'whole' 
once more. The Cenobites re-
appear when they find- out, 
causing havoc to the lovers. 
This is a movie to see, even if 
you are squeamish. The gross 
parts are pretty predictable, as 

"Hellraiser," the debut for 
popular British horror writer 
Clive Barker as director, is a 
non-stop scream-fest that is 
most definitely not for the 
squeamish. This is the best 
horror movie I have ever seen. 
The thrills are non-stop, yet, 
unlike most horror movies, 
'Hellraiser' has a plot. This 
movie is reminiscent of the 
best of the Stephen King movie 
adaptations ('The Shining' 
comes to mind). Indeed, 'Hell-
raiser' is commendable for 
more than its ability to fright-
en. When you get down to it, 
it is really a 'love' story be-
tween a woman and the 'man' 
she loves. 

The' man' in this story hap-

pens to be skinless. He is this movie is not a 'sudden-
literally torn to small pieces fright' type horror movie. It 
by the alien, demon-like Cen- chills with the unknown , not 
obites, as they simultaneously with the unpredictable.

be with the story. For example, 
there seems to be absolutely 
no reason for Dan to cheat on 
his wife, Beth (Anne Archer). 
The first 10 minutes suggest a 
very nice home life for Dan, 
and when he meets Alex for 
the first time, it seems he 
couldn't be less interested . Al-
so, Dan appears to be com-
pletely oblivious to Alex's 
mental problems. When she 
cuts her wrists in front ofhim, 
he just dresses her wounds, 
and then leaves. Instead of 
helping Alex, Dan attempts to 
ignore her. 

Dan Gallagher comforts Alex Forrest. 

At the end, the story tries to 
make it up to the viewer with 
some suspense-filled action. It 

is predictable, yet scary. The 
director, Adrian Lyre ("9 liZ 
Weeks", "Flashdance"), does 
an adequate job with a story of

A look at the upcoming Theatre Season 
by charles duston 

hiatul writer 

The UCSD theatre training 
program is among the finest 
on the continent of North 
America. Their eight shows 
this year portend a cornucopia 
of ancient and modern out-
pourings, and include works 
of a pastoral, musical, tragical, 
hysterical and romantic na-
ture. 

The mainstage season, at 
the Weiss Center, begins with 
a criminal satire set in renais-
sance Venice. Ben Jonson's 
"Volpone" directed by Steve 
Pearson, will take the lights on 
November 6-7 and II-H. In 
February, Ralph Janes will 
direct a new play by Reid 
Jensen, "Dickson: Old News 
from the New War, " wherein 
citizens of a town secede from 
the Union, for they refuse to 
keep the government's missiles 
in their little city. 

In March , the 19th century 
psychological drama, "Prince 

Friedrich of Homburg," will 
be directed by Beth Schachter . 
This Heinrich von Kleist pia y, 
which portrays a bitter struggle 
between royal father and son, 
was banned by the Prussians. 
It will be followed in April by 
a work with a guest artist, to 
be announcecl . Negotiations 
are under way with European 
and American directors. 

Four productions are also 
to be performed this fall and 
winter. "The Labyrinth," by 
Fernando Arrabal, is sched-
uled for November 18-22 at 
the Warren Theatre. Its dark, 
humorous wit is to be followed 
in early December by the in-
sane, romantic comedy, "The 
Madman, The Nurse - or 
There Is Nothing Bad Which 
Would Not Turn Into Some-
thing Worse," by S.l. Wit-
kiewitz. That mouthful is to 
be presented at the Weiss 
Center, with close seating in 
risers onstage.

ary, the exotic musical "Brazo

Warren lights.

four productions will be
