The UC Board of Regents voted 
yesterday to increase student fees for 
the 2008-09 school year, prompting 
an immediate outcry from the UC 
Students Association and other stu-
dents attending the meeting.

Discussion on the proposal 
began with the UCSA presenting 
testimonials from UC students who 
demonstrated how increased stu-
dent fees would negatively impact 
their education. They asked the 
regents to take student concerns 
into consideration when making 
their decision, and also proposed 
putting a permanent freeze on stu-
dent fees.

After the presentations, the 
regents approved the increases with 
a 7-2 vote and rejected the pro-
posed fee freeze.

Mandatory systemwide fees will 
increase by 7 percent, nonresident 
undergraduate tuition will increase 
by 5 percent and a temporary $60 
surcharge approved by the regents 
in July 2005 will be applied to all 
enrolled students.

The regents cited Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s 2008-09 budget 
proposal — which includes a 10-
percent reduction in funding for 
the university’s base budget — the 
increased costs of maintaining 
university operation, an increase 
in mental-health services and the 
need to maintain and hire competi-
tive faculty and staff as reasons for 
authorizing the fee increases.

“It is regrettable that fee increases 
are necessary to address the univer-
sity’s needs, but I want to reassure 
students that the university has an 
exceptional financial aid program, 
which along with an increase in 
Cal Grant awards, will mitigate the 
impact of higher fees on financial-
ly needy low- and middle-income 
students,” UC President Robert C. 
Dynes said in a statement. 

He added that 43 percent of 
undergraduates will have their full 
fee increase covered by grant funds.

The UC governing body defend-
ed the increases by emphasizing that 
they would not affect the students

This week, the oft-empty green 
of RIMAC Field was conspicuously 
filled with scattered stage, light and 
sound equipment, errant wires and 
burly workers hoisting machinery. 
Come Friday, A.S. programmers are 
hoping that students fill the area, 
drawn to the site by a freshly con-
ceived festival garnished with all-
new attractions.

“The Sun God Festival has been 

reborn as an event that ties togeth-
er every part of the UCSD com-
munity,” said Festivals Coordinator 
Garrett Berg, who has spent the year 
rethinking and redoing the campus’ 
largest event with other program-
ming staff.

This year’s festival will mark 
many firsts for the annual event: 
it will permit re-entry, host over 
40 entertainment acts and feature a 
full range of activities exclusive to

The Price Center East launch party 
took place May 12, unveiling most of 
the newly completed campus hub and 
offering student performances, prizes, 
self-guided tours and free food. 

Price Center was originally designed 
for a population of 15,000 students 
and staff members, but UCSD’s grow-
ing population required the space to 
double in size. UCSD currently enrolls 
about 28,000 students and is expected 
to reach 30,000 within two years.

University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino said the purpose of the expan-
sion launch party was to celebrate Price 
Center as a new “downtown” for UCSD 
and unite students and community 
members by increasing programming 
space and activities. 

The celebration took place in the 
new atrium and included a dedica-
tion ceremony with speeches from 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs Steve W. 
Relyea and Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue. Additional speakers 
included A.S. President Donna Bean 

and University Centers Advisory Board 
Chair Matthew Bright. 

The event also featured live music, 
student performances, complimentary 
food and drinks from current and new 
Price Center eateries and raffle prizes 
that included airline tickets, cameras 
and a laptop.

“In terms of attendance, [the party] 
was very successful,” Terzino said. “We 

had at least 4,000 people attend the 
event.” 

Most of the new Price Center is now 
open, including general indoor seating 
for dining, lounge seating, computer 
labs, study rooms and lockers, stu-
dent organization offices and a Stuart

Campus Eye Center 
Receives Award for Study

UCSD’s Shiley Eye Center 
has been honored for its stud-
ies and treatment of age-related 
eye diseases, including macular 
degeneration. At the Age-Related 
Eye Disease Study II confer-
ence in Houston last month, 
Shiley’s Division of Community 
Ophthalmology was chosen out 
of 82 centers to receive an award 
for exemplary overall performance 
efforts and was one of seven 
institutions to be recognized for 
Exemplary Data Quality.

The AREDS2 is a multi-
center randomized trial, funded 
by the National Eye Institute of 
the National Institutes of Health, 
designed to determine the effects 
of vitamins, minerals and fish oil 
on macular degeneration, which 
is a leading cause of vision loss 
among Americans 60 years of age 
and older.

UCSD Shiley team leader 
Barbara L. Brody, a clinical pro-
fessor of ophthalmology and 
family and preventive medicine 
and director of the Community 
Ophthalmology Division at Shiley, 
called the recognition a great 
honor, considering the high level 
of national competition.

“We are honored to be among 
such prestigious competition,” 
Brody said in a statement. “This 
recognition is a reaffirmation of our 
everyday standard of excellence.” 

For its five-year study, the 
Shiley team recruited individuals 
between the ages of 50 and 85 
with drusen — yellow deposits 
under the retina — in both eyes or 

large drusen in one eye and age-
related macular degeneration in 
the other eye.

 The original trial found that anti-
oxidant supplements lowered the 
risk of advanced AMD for patients 
with intermediate stage AMD. In 
addition, patients with high con-
sumption of omega-3 fatty acids 
and lutein were at lower risk.

Ecology Professor Offers 
Free Lecture at Scripps
Richard E. Lenski, distinguished 

professor of microbial ecology 
at Michigan State University, will 
present the annual Rosenblatt 
Lectureship, entitled “Evolution in 
Action: Bugs and Bytes,” May 15 
in Sumner Auditorium at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. The 
lecture is free and open to the 
public.

Lenski, a MacArthur Foundation 
Fellow and an elected mem-
ber of the National Academy of 
Sciences, has been recognized 
for his experiments with bacteria 
that replicate, mutate and evolve 
quickly, which have allowed him 
to observe the genetic mecha-
nisms and ecological processes 
of evolution.

In one experiment that began 
20 years ago, Lenski and his team 
have watched populations of the 
harmful bacteria Escherichia coli 
— commonly known as E-coli 
— evolve in their laboratory to 
investigate the dynamics of the 
bacteria’s adaptation and diversi-
fication. More recently, Lenski has 
extended his evolutionary experi-
ments to computer programs that 
replicate, mutate and evolve.

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND



Operation Sudden Fall, the undercover 
sting operation initiated a year ago in 
response to a student’s death on cam-
pus from a cocaine overdose, under 
suspicion of connection to the univer-
sity’s alleged drug ring.

The remaining 41 arrests were con-
ducted by campus police officers for 
minor drug offenses uncovered over 
the last five months. Officials said these 
41 individuals were not necessarily 
connected to the exposed drug opera-
tions, but were placed under arrest as a 
result of the zero-tolerance drug policy 
enforced by campus officials during the 
course of the investigation.

In the week since the yearlong 
undercover investigation came to 
a close, some campus groups have 
raised concerns over the impact that 
the bust might have on the university. 
Although SDSU President Stephen 
Weber hailed the arrests as a victory 
for the campus, others have called the 
investigation unnecessary and ulti-
mately ineffective.

Members of Students for Sensible 
Drug Policy, an organization commit-
ted to spreading awareness about the 
impacts of drugs on college campus-
es, spoke out against the drug busts 
at a rally on the campus last week. 
President of the organization’s SDSU 
chapter Randy Hencken said the busts 
will likely have little impact on student 
drug use in the long run.

“So long as students have the desire 
to use illegal drugs, and so long as the 
prohibition of drugs sustains a lucrative 
black market, drug stings will do little 
more than create openings for others 
to step in and supply these drugs,” 
Hencken said at the rally.

Council Elects New Speaker, Discusses 
Potential of Darfur Scholarship

Councilmembers new and old were in attendance last night for the first regular meeting 
of the 2008-09 A.S. Council. With no 
time to waste, the council considered 
two important matters: the ongoing 
genocide in Darfur and the election of 
a new council speaker.

Thurgood Marshall College sopho-
more Daniel Nguyen was on hand to 
speak to the council about a scholar-
ship program for UCSD that educates 
Sudanese students at American univer-
sities. Nguyen, who was representing 
Students Taking Action Now: Darfur, 
described the decades-long conflict 
within Sudan, which he said has killed 
400,000 and dis-
placed millions, to 
frame the neces-
sity of providing 
Sudanese students 
with access to 
American higher 
education. The 
goal of the scholar-
ship program is to inform participants 
about resource management and infra-
structure development so that they can 
apply it in the public sector when they 
return to Sudan.

“We can’t just focus on privileged 
students,” said Nguyen, urging the 
council to expand the scope of its con-
cern beyond La Jolla.

The relative lack of discussion fol-
lowing his presentation revealed a 
degree of reticence in the new council. 
Despite the numerous considerations 
surrounding a new university-backed 
stipend to host abroad students, the 
councilmembers saved most of their 
opinions for the election of a new coun-
cil speaker after the presentation.

Former Biological Sciences Senator 
and outgoing speaker Emma Sandoe 
described the salient responsibilities of 
the position, from compiling orders of 
business and monitoring attendance to 
moderating debates at meetings and 

enforcing the oft-abused Robert’s Rules 
of Order.

Sixth College Senator John Cressey 
and Engineering Senator Jordan Taylor 
accepted nominations from their fellow 
councilmembers for the position. To 
compete for the position, each can-
didate was asked to speak for a few 
minutes about their qualifications and 
field questions from councilmembers 
about how they would meet their obli-
gations a speakers. Each candidate was 
addressed individually while the other 
waited outside of the meeting room 
(presumably in an intimidating sound-
proof isolation chamber). 

Cressey emphasized his three years 
of experience with 
the council and his 
willingness to sur-
render his voting 
power in order to 
serve as speaker.

“This is my 
fourth year being 
an A.S. senator and 

I don’t mind stepping back and being a 
facilitator instead of a debater since I’ve 
been here awhile,” he said.

Taylor, on the other hand, leveraged 
his recent experiences throughout the 
last year as a first-time councilmem-
ber to show that he would be “a good 
resource for new members who have 
questions.”

Councilmembers, including the 
newest ones, asked the candidates  
questions about Robert’s Rules, speaker 
objectivity and the potential to inter-
fere with responsibilities to constituents 
since the speaker can’t vote. Cressey 
and Taylor had similar responses, and 
both said they believed their constitu-
ents could be served through other 
council positions.

But it was Taylor who won in the 
secret-ballot vote, securing his seat 
behind the all-powerful microphone 
until this day rolls around again next 
May.

who would have the most trouble 
paying them due to increases in 
financial aid that would be gener-
ated by fee revenue. The university 
will return about 33 percent of rev-
enues from the undergraduate fee 
increase to financial aid. As a result, 
additional grants will be provided 
covering all of the fee increase to 
on-time applicants whose family 
incomes are lower than approxi-
mately $60,000 per year. In addi-
tion, the governor’s budget pro-

Grant recipients.
UCSA President Louise 

Hendrickson argued that such a 
large amount of financial aid 
wouldn’t be necessary if fees weren’t 
so high in the first place. 

“We also have the cost of living, 
which is a problem,” she said. “It’s 
never enough because students are 
still struggling to make ends meet. 
The true cost of attending a univer-
sity is not covered by financial aid.”

Several regents also said that an 
increase in student fees should only 
be used as a last resort, and excess 
spending should be completely elimi-
nated before fee increases are passed. 

Other regents made compari-
sons with public institutions such 
as the University of Michigan and 
University of Illinois show that, 
when taking scholarships and 
grant assistance into account, the 
University of California’s total cost 
of attendance is below that of these 
comparable institutions for finan-
cial aid recipients. 

However, Lt. Gov. John 
Garamendi said the stresses of 
increased student fees are placed 
heavily on middle-class students, 
who oftentimes are not eligible to 
receive aid. Garamendi also said 
students at several comparable 

Hendrickson: Financial Aid Insufficient for All College Expenses
▶ FEES, from page 1 universities have a large percent-

age of out-of-state students who 
can afford to pay higher fees, and 
warned against putting the UC sys-
tem on the same path of privatiza-
tion as these universities. 

“The long successful tradition of 
California that built this economy is 
being pushed aside, and the federal 
government is getting off free,” he said. 
“The more we raise fees, the less the 
state spends. It is a very vicious cycle.”

Hendrickson sees the decision as 
a partial victory for students since it 
was originally proposed that the fees 
would be increased by 10 percent. 

“We don’t support any fee 

increases, but over previous options 
that were much higher, 7.4 [per-
cent] is $30 million in extra fees 
that are going back into students’ 
pockets,” Hendrickson said. “This 
was a partial victory but of course 
no fee increase is a full win.”

According to Hendrickson, the 
UCSA, along with community col-
leges and the CSU system, “will be 
demanding that the state Legislature 
buy out our fee increase and restore 
the rest of the money that has been cut 
out” from the university on May 19.

lage-artist Barbara Kruger. Meetings 
have already taken place in the new 
conference rooms. On the fourth 
level, the Associated Students, Alumni 
Association and other student organi-
zations have already moved into their 
new offices.

Terzino said that the East Ballroom 
— which currently has only limited 
use — the west side of the Grand Stairs 
and the Cross-Cultural Center will be 
complete by mid-June, and the Triton 
Statue to be located at the base of the 
Grand Stairs will be unveiled during 
Fall Quarter 2008.

The Loft, a nightclub performance 
space and social lounge, will be finished 
during the summer and officially open 
on the first day of classes in September, 
according to University Events Office 
Director Martin Wollesen. 

“[The Loft] will be rented out for 
use during the summer to the campus 
and community departments and orga-
nizations for their events,” Wollesen 
said in an e-mail. “The restaurant will 
not be in place by that point; however, 
we are hopeful that it will be in place 
for the fall.” 

Some of the most highly anticipated 
sections of the new Price Center are 
the eight new restaurants that will be 
located in the atrium in the fall. So 
far, planned restaurants include Burger 
King, Mediterranean/Greek restaurant 
Santorini Island Grill, Indian food eat-
ery Bombay Coast and Asian tea shop 
Tapioca Express. According to Terzino, 
the university is still in the process of 
selecting four more eateries — a coffee 
shop, a creperie, a pasta restaurant and 
the Loft restaurant. 

Although the new restaurants will 
not be completed until fall, students 
have already started to use the indoor 
seating — designated for about 375 
people — which was designed to allevi-
ate weekday traffic. 

Terzino said student fees fund-
ed most of the areas that have been 
opened so far, including the atrium

“Because three-fourths of the stu-
dent fee that is supporting the expan-

it was important to get the fee-funded 
areas opened early in the quarter,” he 
said. 

The Price Center expansion is the 
third and final stage of the University

Berg said he hopes that the 

wide selection of attractions brings 
attendees in droves, but acknowl-
edged that students may be jarred 
by the festival’s new layout. A.S. 
Vice President Programming Kevin 
Highland and Berg enlisted hand-
fuls of volunteers to publicize and 
distribute informative pamphlets 
familiarizing students with the 
event’s overhauled structure.

Earl Warren College sophomore 
Eric Mendoza coordinates Sun God 
Avenue, one of the new festival’s 
most student-involved locations, 
and said that many students he’s 
encountered have been confused 
with the festival’s new procedures, 
which include hand stamps for re-
entry to RIMAC Field and wrist-
band types for students and nonaf-
filiates. He added that those initial 
reactions were often smoothed over 
when the festival procedure was 
fully explained.

“A lot of students are put off 
when we mention that everything 
will be on north campus,” said 
Mendoza, who spent the week dis-
tributing wristbands to students for 
entry. “But the event is pretty simple 
to enjoy once it’s fully explained. It 
will still be the same great Sun God, 
but instead everything sponsored 
by A.S. programming will be on 
RIMAC Field.”

Sun God Avenue will stretch the 
entirety of Hopkins Drive, which 
will be closed all of Friday to make 
way for over 60 spaces for food 
vendors, street-fair attractions and 
student groups ranging from fra-
ternities to cultural organizations. 
Mendoza said that he encountered a 
strong desire from student organiza-
tions to participate in the reformed 
festival.

Concert stages will be located 
on RIMAC Field, flanked by a 
number of other sites such as the 

Street Fair Will Feature Booths, Vendors

Triton Carnival, sporting life-size 
inflatable games, and the Midway, 
a space displaying student artwork 
and films.

Headliners performing on the

R&B artist Sean Kingston and Los 
Angeles-based underground hip-
hop group Living Legends.

OPINION

By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — It 
was a scene ripped from a novel, film 
or any other meaty piece of drama. 
After an extended scrap that solves 
nothing, two characters with divergent 
agendas go head-to-head in a heated 
standoff.

And nothing was more heated 
than the UC Regents meeting on 
May 14, where students jockeying to 
lower their fees angrily interrupted 
regents with loud chants and protest. 
Representatives from nearly every 
major student advocacy group had 
attended the meeting, hoping to stave 
off yet another fee hike. Affordability 
and accessibility to public colleges 
like the University of California, they 
argue, is irreversibly damaged by the 
seemingly unstoppable rising tide of 
fees.

Regents and UC administrators, on 
the other hand, were pushing their own 
agenda. For a university system rooted 
in its prestige — specifically in fields 
of research and scientific advancement 
— the state’s faltering budget, and 
subsequent UC financial problems, 
fees and tuition would need to rise to 
sustain quality outside the classroom. 
Students need to at least acknowledge 
that a university’s mission has more to 
do with grants and research funds than 
they would prefer.

But that doesn’t negate the fact that 
students are being slowly suffocated 
by fees that unabatedly rise. Students 
have seldomly seen fees decrease in 
the past decade, save for Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s fee freeze in 2006-
07. That reprieve was short-lived and 
ultimately ineffective: students were 
spared a year of fee increases only to 
see the level doubled the next year. 

And now, students face a 7-percent 
increase in systemwide fees, costing the 
common student hundreds of dollars 
more. Outgoing UC President Robert 
C. Dynes has commented that the exis-
tence of several state-sponsored grants 
and scholarships help blunt the blow 
of the hike, no amount of grants will 
plug the gaping hole burned into UC 
affordability. Regents reasoned that the 
most needy of students would be cov-
ered by need-based grants, which will 

I f adopted, a sweeping new UC Office of President proposal barring nonaffiliates from 
unapproved activities across the 10-
campus system would be a sad blow 
to one of the cornerstones of our 
democracy: freedom of speech.

Hailed by the university as a 
security blanket for students, faculty 
and staff, the policy was designed 
in part to keep nonaffiliates from 
disrupting university affairs. But the 
University of California is a public 
institution, funded by taxpayer dol-
lars, so attempting to prevent non-
affiliates from speaking on campus 
is roughly equivalent to banning 
students from gathering at public 
parks. It’s ludicrous.

Sure, assembly areas such as 
Library Walk tend to be frequented 
by outrageous fanatics who unabash-
edly spew hate speech, and annoying 
canvassers who want your money 
for one reason or another, but ban-
ning all nonaffiliates from campus 
is a complete overreaction. While 
some members of the campus com-
munity may disagree with, or even be 
offended by, the words of bombastic 
religious zealots, others may agree 

with their messages and instead be 
put off by liberal Bush-bashers. 

Regardless of what their mes-
sages are, nonaffiliates should only 
be labeled disruptive on a case-by-
case basis, like with campus affili-
ates or citizens in a public space, 
and not be all but banned from 
on-campus activities as outlined in 
the proposal. 

Supporters of the policy like it 
for instance-specific reasons, ignor-
ing its ridiculously vast scope and 
the extremely negative consequenc-
es it will bring to the university. 

But it is inappropriate and pater-
nalistic for administrators to set the 
standard for what students should 
and should not hear. And the minor 
inconveniences — such as being dis-
turbed at lunchtime — cited by pro-
ponents as reasons for the policy 
change certainly do not warrant such 
an extremely reactionary restriction 
of precious First Amendment rights.

Truly free speech is not depen-
dent on the speaker’s message. And 
for a public university — a place of 
learning and free exchange of ideas 
— to discriminate against something 
because it merely sounds unpleasant 

undermines everything that we, as 
young thinkers and leaders, should 
hold dear. 

Moreover, the UCOP proposal 
would set a frightening precedent 
that extends far beyond the realm 
of nonaffiliates. Students, staff or 
faculty conducting impromptu pro-
tests might be jeopardized if they 
don’t have proof of their UC affili-
ation. And even if the former isn’t 
an issue, their causes would still 

be severely weakened by the limits 
on support from nonaffiliates. (One 
notable example where this might 
occur is within UC Nuclear Free, 
an organization that often includes 
nonaffiliates in its protests against 
UC nuclear-research policies.) 

If the university really wants to 
act in the best interests of students, 
staff and faculty, it needs to scrap 
this hazardous violation of freedom 
— and fast.

I t is a stalwart annual Guardiantradition to hold a prefestival celebration within its editorial 
pages. This year’s brand-new Sun God 
Festival offers this board the first stab 
at evaluating the event’s yearlong 
development, offer insight into each 
stage of its headline-making progress 
and predict its long-term impact on 
the campus.

Given the scope of changes to 
the festival, our opinion of the festi-
val has been admittedly impulsive. 
The initial release of the Sun God 
Planning Report was met with trepi-
dation. The full-scale 22-page report 
was a full-fledged attack on Sun God. 
Administrators called for an event 
that was safer (too many drunkards!), 
more organized (too many long, messy 
lines!) and warmer in spirit (too many 
drunkards, not enough community!). 
At that point, our beloved bird seemed 
inevitably headed to a rocky landing 
that this board predicted would be an 
unwelcome, toned-down makeover.

When A.S. programmers first 
revealed their festival blueprints, 
trepidation gave way to excitement. 
A.S. Vice President of Programming 
Kevin Highland, Festivals Coordinator 
Garrett Berg and their staff smartly 

conceptualized the most student-relat-
ed points of the report, and used them 
as the cornerstone of the new festival. 
The end product was a festival UCSD 
has never seen, one that finally insti-
tutionalizes student involvement and 
community ideals through student-run 
booths, artwork displays and countless 
other attractions. Tritons have always 
been a part of the Sun God Festival; 
in their new festival, programmers 
have evolved the event’s participatory 
aspects and finally carved out physical 
spaces for students. 

Then, the bubble popped. The new 
festival, with its countless add-ons, was 
too good to be true and too expen-
sive to pay for. Following the firm 
logic of the campus administrators and 
departments that initially demanded 
changes to the festival, programmers 
and A.S. councilmembers found only 
empty pockets when courting poten-
tial supporters, which included Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue and the Alumni Association. 
Scrounging together funds from small-
business sponsorships and the A.S. 
Council — the latter to a generous 
tune of $30,000 — programmers were 
able to still host their new festival 
as planned, but with a glaring cave-

at: If the festival’s wavering financial 
health continues, programmers will 
not be able to sustain such an expan-
sive operation. The solutions include 
major corporate sponsorship or the 
intensely distasteful option of a student 
referendum.

This board is still holding its col-
lective breath, as is much of UCSD. 
But no amount of tension should 
mar the day itself. Judgment comes 
after partying, folks, so let’s enjoy our 
festival’s long road to stardom safely, 
before we have to pay for it ourselves.

Ears Open Tritons, Even if You Don’t Like What Is Said

ILLUSTRATIONS BY ADAM PELTIER/GUARDIAN

know who is playing this year but 
I would hope, for the sake of visi-
tors, that the music sounds better 
live than it does portably. And 
unless you look forward to not 
having to pay for your prospec-
tive attendance, know that those 
kooky activity fees you pay every 
quarter more than make up for 
your lack of money at the gate.

But, to be honest, I don’t know 
if anybody who attends this scene 
really cares for the bands anyway. 
Getting drunk, it’s overrated.    

With Festival Nearing, Here’s One Triton Who’s Unconvinced
Many of you have without a doubt heard something about the upcoming 
party that is set to overtake this 
campus. What I’m referencing in a 
roundabout way is, of course, the 
Sun God Festival. Much of what 
you have heard is correct: nation-
ally recognized acts are going to 
perform, curious occurrences 
begin to take a hold around cam-
pus and many don’t even show up 
to class during UCSD’s unofficial 
ditch day.  

Yet it troubles me to say that it 
has become popular to correlate 
the Sun God Festival with ram-
pant drinking, wanton disregard 
for normal behavior and even fool-
ish attempts to outdo everybody 
with the effort to steer a popularity 
streak toward oneself.

the spirit of the Sun God Festival, 
whatever that is, found its way into 
our drab classroom.

In any case, the class went a buzz 
with talk of more police presence 
being made available, thus inhibit-
ing our chances of experiencing 

Nonetheless, I pose a worthy 
question not as a critic and not 
even as a high-minded golden-
ager. A pragmatist such as myself 
would ask: Why risk trouble with 
the law for a one-time stab at 
debauchery? What could make it 
so that this relatively short occa-
sion brings about the dullest in 
a person, respectively? Why also 
does the prospect of times given to 
individuals to let loose curtail the 
basic faculties needed for rational 
existence?

During a recent discussion sec-
tion that I attended, the class hap-
pened to shed light on the upcom-
ing celebrations. Do not ask me 
why we were encouraged to keep 
up the conversation about this 
topic in class — I readily have 
no answer. Perhaps it was because 

maximum celebration. There were 
other items discussed during class 
time, but I think it is safe to say 
that I learned more about drunk-
en bicyclists than about priorities 
requiring the most heed.   

Yet what it all really centers 
around is the fact that the Sun God 
Festival really is nothing more than 
UCSD’s boldest step in attempting 
to ameliorate an already disaffect-
ed student body. 

But I can’t help but to think 
that there may have been better 
ways to shore up some pride on 
this campus than to put on a spec-
tacle where a collection of science 
nerds presumptuously attempts to 
loosen up.  

It is up to you, of course, in 
regard to whether you opt to go to 
this event or not. I cannot claim to

receive 33 percent of revenue gener-
ated from the fee increase.

That, of course, leaves the rest of us 
students, the ones whose middle-class 
family incomes disqualify them from 
the maximum amount of grant allow-
ance — or from some grants all togeth-
er. It is a point rightly accented by 
Lt. Gov. John Garamendi, who called 
the regents’ move the impetus for a 
“vicious cycle” of increased spending 
and fee hikes.

As the system’s official student 
advocacy group, members of UC 
Student Association are leading a los-
ing fight against UC administration. 

Their stab at the regents was summed 
up in a lackluster fashion by UCSA 
President Louise Hendrickson, who 
found the thinnest silver lining pos-
sible on this fat, stormy cloud: At least 
students weren’t charged the original 
10-percent hike.

Seeing students accept the lesser of 
two evils evokes a sad commentary on 
this state’s state of affairs. With finan-
cial worries sending Sacramento into 
disarray, there seems to be a shrinking 
amount of political and financial atten-
tion on higher education.

UCSA may find its most power-
ful and effective friend in new UC 
President Mark G. Yudof, who brings 

with him a history of wrangling with 
officials for student interests. It is a far 
cry from Dynes, whose background is 
grounded in research. 

Yudof has publicly spoken out 
in support of lower tuition and fees, 
emphasizing the importance of higher 
education’s affordability. He has also 
talked of his uneasy approach to the 
state’s deeply rooted financial prob-
lems. It may take more than a UC pres-
ident or regents to make the drastic 
shift needed for student fees — it may 
take all of the students themselves.

where our final destination was. It’s easier. On 
this tour, we’re on the bus, travel at night and then 
we wake up.

TG: Do you think that’s the hardest part of being 
on tour?

AG: Well, the hardest part of the tour for us as a 
band is that the van drives are really long. When 
we were on tour with Paramore and the Bravery, 
they were on buses — the driver sleeps all day, so 
it’s okay. They’d just perform and then get on a bus. 
We’d drive after a show, sleep for four hours and 
then drive to another. 

TG: Do you have any preshow rituals? Do you get 
stage fright?

AG: I get stage fright all the time. As for the rituals, 
we’ll do a football huddle, say one or two things 
about what we want from the show and then, I 
guess, go “Go Team!” You know the game Street 
Fighter II? When one of them throws a fireball, they 
go “Hadoken!” So we’ve been saying “Hadoken!” 
before every show on this tour. 

TG: What is your favorite tour memory?

AG: There’s one time when Darren [Robinson, 
Phantom Planet’s guitarist] and I got really drunk 
and we got into a fight. Throwing punches. I 
pushed him into the bathroom of our bus and 
locked him in. I wouldn’t let him get out and he got 
really pissed and actually knocked the door down 
onto me. The door literally came down like he was 
surfing. We’ve never fought since. 

TG: I was introduced to Phantom Planet at age 
13 when I watched “The O.C.” for the first time. 
Do you think that your fan base changed after the 
premiere of the show?

AG: No, I didn’t really notice any difference in 
fan base. Though we were in Tokyo once and I 
met a grandmother who liked us, so I think it just 

expanded our listener base.

TG: I read in your previous interviews that your 
split with Jason Schwartzman was friendly? What 
happened?

AG: He’s a good guy and I think what happened 
was our ambitions got in the way. His acting career 
and the band couldn’t coexist and the split was ami-
able. It was necessary to survive — to record and go 
on tour on a new level. So, we just split.

TG: Do you think you’ll ever record a collaboration 
with Jason and Coconut Records?

AG: I wouldn’t leave that out of the realm of pos-
sibility. I know that a lot of the songs that are 
on Jason’s records are ones that I had heard for 
Phantom Planet, but didn’t make the cut. I think it’s 
great and really fun. If anything, I wouldn’t cross off 
a collaboration between him and us in the future. 
Yeah, I’m just going to say that — for people who 
have their hopes up? Keep them up!

TG: If you could run naked through a field with any 
celebrity, who would it be?

AG: [Osama] Bin Laden. I saw a picture of Bin Laden 
when he was a child — it was all over the Internet 
yesterday. And he looked so innocent. I think when 
people are naked, when they take off their clothes, 
it puts us all on the same level. So, I wouldn’t mind 
bringing Osama down to my level for just one run 
through a field.

no end to essentially rape a spe-
cific game. I can’t stress enough the 
importance of the word “rape,” as 
these gamers don’t just beat a game 
in a normal fashion (i.e. until the 
credits roll). They go above and 
beyond to complete each and every 
achievement that a title throws at 
them. For example, in a given RPG 
these gamers will max out the stats 
for any and all characters, finish 
every single side-quest, gather every 
single rare item, raise a farm of 
golden chocobos and search for 
every single ending, among other 
ridiculous pursuits. A gamer with 
this obsessive tic won’t rest until 
they’ve drained every bit of juice 
from a game.

The other type of player person-
ality that I’ve noticed is the “social 
gamer.” These are the types who 
would prefer to play games with 
friends or healthy human compe-

tition and rarely find enjoyment 
in a singular experience. While in 
previous generations of consoles, 
the social experience was found 
mostly in proximity (see Contra, 
Goldeneye) and was hard to popu-
larize especially since multiplayer is 
now a gaming standard, the number 
of social gamers has increased with 
the advent of robust online services 
and recent broadband saturation. 
These are the gamers you’ll find in 
a server at any time of the day, the 
regulars. These players find plea-
sure not in the games themselves, 
but in the community they foster.

And I like to call the final gamer 
type the “casually hardcore.” These 
are the gamers that can’t really com-
mit themselves to any one game; 
they’re up to date on all the block-
buster titles and current trends, yet 
can’t quite finish, play, or even buy 
them. Perhaps they don’t have the 
time, or perhaps they don’t have 

the money. Whatever the reason, 
these gamers typically find joy by 
sampling a large number of games 
rather than one singular experi-
ence.

This isn’t to say that these three 
caricatures are the be-all-end-all 
of gamer types. What makes the 
average hardcore gamer so complex 
is that it becomes difficult to pin 
him/her to a distinct label; as with 
anything, a bit of cross-breeding 
occurs. For example, a gamer who’s 
obsessed with World of Warcraft 
could either be playing for the grind 
or to socialize with other people. 
The same could be said for Halo 
players, who range from the teabag-
ging griefer with a sense of humor 
to the immature kid from Kentucky 
who calls you a faggot and then 
snipes your head off. The moral of 
the story: it’s never easy to tell who’s 
on the other end of the headset 
(unless they call you a faggot).

Islands
■ Arm’s Way
ANTI 

N ick Thorburn (formerly Nick Diamonds) and his motley crew of Canadian music men and Asian string savants (aka the illustrious Chow brothers) return to the fore 
with the semi-concept album Arm’s Way, a sophomore 
release rife with clever details but lacking in pop substance. 
Islands have always played like a vaudevillian version of the 
Arcade Fire, their mature orchestration starkly contrasting 
Thorburn’s morbid-chic lyrics and jittery compositions. It 
seems here that the collective has plotted out a cookie-cutter 
house in the guise of an ambitious prog-rock epic, taking the 
charming and forgivable faults of the lo-fi Unicorns and mag-
nifying them for Islands’ brand of arena indie. 

The madness fades in with “The Arm,” a full-bodied over-
view of the extended suites to come, hitting every conceivable 
emotion and tempo within the song’s five-and-a-half minutes. 
There’s bouncy kitsch, a short space-rock breakdown, an 
indie-western soundtrack — everything! With all these rapid 
dynamics, you’ll either be totally impressed or feel worn out 
like you do after an album’s worth of Yes wankery. Thankfully, 
the immeasurably catchy Unicorns-extra “Abominable Snow” 

and album standout “Creeper” salvage the record from being 
a total misstep. The former rocks every instrument in a rhyth-
mic ballet, wrapping violin jabs and bass murmurs around 
Thorburn’s vocal melody like a symphonic apocalypse; the 
latter’s chugging techno bump and memorable lines about 
neighborhood intruders might be a healthy direction for the 
band to follow next round.    

Thorburn’s songwriting methods show their seams 
on much of Way’s second half, most notably with the 
predictable yawner “To a Bond” and the sludge-lite of 
bloated closer “Vertigo (If it’s a Crime).” The mastermind 
behind “Jellybones” and “Rough Gem” has sadly muffled 
his talent for odd popcraft by trying too hard to grow 
up, instead just giving us hollow, distanced lyrics and a 
dense pastiche of dull musical snippets. Maybe he should 
change his last name back to Diamonds and embrace his 
inner Unicorn before getting the house band back in the 
studio.

Santogold
■ Santogold
DOWNTOWN 

H ailed as the American incarnation of critically acclaimed hip-hop artist M.I.A., Santogold’s self-titled debut intro-duces her strength as a solo artist. Santogold boasts a 
series of highly eclectic and experimental beats, a blend of 
guitar riffs, electronica and synthesizer supplemented by Santi 
White’s sharp, high-pitched lyrics.

Though reminiscent of the “Paper Planes” agit-diva M.I.A., 
Santogold separates herself by replacing M.I.A.’s Bollywood 
and bhangra influences with elements of reggae and African 
drumming. The beats are often amplified over inconsistent 
vocals, reflecting the unfortunate fact that Santogold can’t sing 
with the same seamless flow and furious pacing of M.I.A. This 
beat affinity often gets her into trouble, when it fails to mesh 
with her vocals. Furthermore, Santogold’s relaxed pacing is 
less conducive to dancing than M.I.A.’s highly frenetic and 
bombastic style.

Santogold has attempted to downplay her similarity with 
M.I.A., asserting that the well-received singles off of Santogold, 
“Creator” and “L.E.S. Artistes,” don’t reflect the album as a 
whole, with the majority of its tracks incorporating generous 
doses of New Age and pop that separate her from M.I.A. 
without classifying her solely as a pop artist. Unfortunately, 
her originality is often surprisingly detrimental to the basic 
sound of her music. Some of the tracks, chiefly “Anne” and 
“My Superman,” lack both the energy of hip-hop and the crys-
tal-clear rhythm of pop, resulting in a grating and lackluster 
listeneing experience.

But while Santogold isn’t yet up to M.I.A.’s more refined 
level, her debut album remains solid enough to foretell a long 
and promising musical career.

Flight of the Conchords
■ Flight of the Conchords
SUB POP

F light of the Conchords label themselves as New Zealand’s fourth most popular folk-parody duo, coming in right behind Like of the Conchords, a Flight of the Conchords 
tribute band. If that didn’t tickle you in some way, you prob-
ably won’t get this album. Flight of the Conchords’ self-titled 
debut is more like a greatest hits collection, making them 
probably the only band in history to debut with such an 
album. Nonetheless, the 15 songs here are so ridiculously well 
crafted that legit music junkies will be prompted to take the 
guys more seriously. 

On their eponymous HBO series, the Kiwis, com-
prised of Bret “Pretty-Boy Elf Extra in ‘Lord of the Rings’” 
McKenzie and Jemaine “The Maori’s Answer to Barry 
White” Clement, play themselves as musicians struggling to 
make it big stateside in a humorless world oblivious to their 
dry witticisms. Unlike “Spinal Tap,” the songs aren’t just an 
extension of their comedy act — for the Conchords, the 
music comes first.

With each song, the bearded McKenzie and bespectacled 
Clement pay homage to others, incorporating details some-
times obvious and other times esoteric. The boys receive 

“transmissions from Bowie’s nipple antennae” as they’re 
“jammin’ out with the Mick Jaggernauts” in their best “Ashes 
to Ashes”/Ziggy Stardust-era impersonations on “Bowie.” 
“Think About It” is a song that Bono is probably kicking his 
own ass for not writing, with the boys whining about world 
problems like “people with diseases from monkeys” while 
backed by Marvin Gaye-esque instrumentation. And the 
cult-fave “Business Time” takes listeners on a four-minute 
erotic journey as Clement coos about integral parts of fore-
play: taking out the recyclables and brushing your teeth.

The lyrics are good on their own, chock-full of one-
liners, but the legitimate music backing them sets the 
Conchords apart from other parody acts. The rap beats in 
“Hiphopopotamus vs. Rhymenocerous” are just the rapid 
strumming of acoustic guitars and the synths in “Inner City 
Pressure” capture the essence of Pet Shop Boys’ “West End 
Girls.”  Also, where else can you hear a binary code solo? If 
you take Flight of the Conchords as just another joke band, 
the joke’s on you.

Jamie Lidell
■ Jim
WARP

Q uirky composition-chameleon Jamie Lidell shifts shape on his latest release, dropping his electro-pow-ered past to serve up a sugary spoonful of ’60s soul. 
It’s as if Lidell — fed up with the packed-sweaty club scene 
and lonely on his subsequent solo space odyssey — took 
this album as an opportunity to come home and tell family, 
friends and fans “Hey guys, I was joking before, just call 
me Jim.”

We start the record sitting on his back porch clapping 
along to smooth piano as birds sing, but then our folksy 
Motown ditty picks up and the camera pans, zooming out 
to reveal the rolling credits of any flavor-of-the-week, feel-
good throwback — Jim tricked us! But as the theme-song 
gospel cooing fades into second track, “Wait for Me,” ooh 

dear lord do we forgive him. And that’s how Jim goes. It’s 
a mellow Motown mishmash; a little taste of all the soul-
R&B-funk hallmarks you wish Detroit was still churning 
out, with the flare of overproduction and a heavy sprinkling 
of chimes. But just as he gets your hips groovin’ Lidell can’t 
escape sounding like the techno-loving white boy he is, 
with mediocre mid tracks like “Figured Me Out.” And the 
spotty album eventually fizzles with weak closer “Rope of 
Sand,” that might as well be off the last Maroon 5 record.

It’s a shame — he started so sweet — but this uneven 
offering leaves us asking: Oh why do you build us up but-
tercup Jamie, just to let us down?

18 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008

after UCSD failed to score in the top 
half of the 10th and allowed a single 
then a double, as CSUS walked-off the 
field with an extra-inning win. 

Although the Tritons were obvi-
ously hoping for a better showing at 
their conference tournament, the team’s 
strong regular season was good enough 
to earn UCSD a No. 2 seed for the West 
Regional. In their first round game 
today, the Tritons will face the Western 
Oregon Wolves, who split a four-game 
series with UCSD to open the season.

“I think we’re very confident,” 
Knudson said. “When we played them 
the first time, we weren’t playing great 
baseball. But we’ve figured a lot of things 

out over the past couple months and I 
think the energy’s really high because 
we know we have a great chance at 
regionals. Everyone’s just stoked.”

Part of the team’s confidence lies 
in the fact that St. John will take the 
mound in the opener, looking to 
bounce back after taking a loss.

“I’m not preparing any different 
for this start than for any of the other 
ones other than hydrating a little more 
for the heat,” St. John said. “I feel really 
good; I feel ready to go and I’m excited 
for the opportunity to pitch. I’m going 
to do my best to try and get us a win.”

“It felt really great because we’ve 
done a lot of work recently to row bet-
ter together and it seemed like every-
thing came together right when we 
needed it to,” he said. 

The men’s crew season ends with a 
string of medals to add to the team’s his-
tory. While the Tritons executed solid 
performances to close out their sea-
son in Massachusetts, the medals were 
acquired last week during the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championships held in Rancho 
Cordova, Calif., on May 4. During day 
two of the regatta, the second varsity 
eight took first place of their final with 
a time of 6:22.6, soundly ahead of the 
second-place UC Davis Aggies, who 
came in four seconds later.

UCSD’s novice-eight boat also 
came through with admirable results, 
as it claimed bronze in the race, fall-
ing behind Orange Coast College and 

Gonzaga University but beating the 
University of San Diego. The sec-
ond novice-eight race saw UCSD take 
silver after crossing the finish line 
right behind OCC. With medal fin-
ishes from the second varsity eight, 
and both novice eights, the Tritons 
brought home a third-place over-
all team points trophy. Additionally, 
UCSD secured third place in the 
championships’ efficiency rankings, 
an assessment of how well each pro-
gram does based on the number of 
boats it has competing. 

With a tightly knit group of experi-
enced members returning next season, 
the future looks bright for UCSD. 

“I’m really looking forward to next 
year, and whole bunch of great guys are 
coming back,” Gordon said. “Hopefully 
we can learn a lot from this year.”

erhouse University of Southern 
California, which also finished the 
season undefeated. Auburn’s head 
coach, Tommy Tuberville, created 
controversy as he had championship 
rings made for the players on his 
team. While the purpose of creat-
ing a playoff system is to prevent an 
outcome like the 2004 season, the 
fact of the matter is a playoff system 
would destroy the tradition and lore 
of the Saturday entertainment that 
so many fans, including myself, fol-
low and cherish. 

A critique often heard from those 
opposed to the BCS system is that 
there is a playoff system in almost 
every Division-I sport and, logically, 
college football should also have 
one. The people with the mindset of 
needing to crown a champion every 
year have been living in agony when 
it comes to college football, as bowl 
games have been in place since the 
1920s. It might be cliche to say, but 
it is important to point out that all 
sports aren’t created equal. Football, 
in its very essence, is a physical 
game and can’t be played like a 
double-header in baseball. Saying 
that college football should hold 
playoffs just because other sports do 
the same ignores the basic fact that 
different sports have fundamental 
needs unique to themselves. 

Football’s physicality, which lim-
its players to one game a week, 
dictates the number of games that 
can be played. Already, most teams 
in college football play a 12-game 
season plus a bowl game. In general 
it takes every game of the season 
to even get close to determining an 
order of teams from best to worst, 
and even after 12 games there still 
can be controversy. It was for this 
reason that the BCS ranking system 
was created in 1998, and though I 
must admit that it is far from per-
fect, the system adapts every year to 
include new improvements, such as 

including the Associated Press poll 
in the rankings formula to get rank-
ings as accurately as possible. 

The proposed four-team playoff 
would not produce a true champion 
like a March Madness tournament 
would because, let’s face it, the top 
four ranked teams aren’t always the 
best teams in the nation. Just look at 
the result of the 2008 FedEx Orange 
Bowl, where the third-ranked 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and 
State University Hokies faced the 
supposed lesser opponent, eighth-
ranked University of Kansas. The 
24-21 Jayhawk victory cements the 
idea that having the top four ranked 
teams in a playoff will not be fully 
representative of the best teams of 
the season (see: No. 3 University 
of Michigan’s loss to No. 5 USC in 
2006). 

The next point that playoff 
mongers will often argue is that we 
should expand the field to eight, 16 
or even 32 teams. The obvious prob-
lem here is that you will never be 
able to please everyone, no matter 
the playoff scenario and no matter 
how many teams it includes. The 
reality is that the teams left out will 
bleat and moan and throw hissyfits 
about being excluded. Besides that, 
there lies the dilemma that a playoff 
would mean an additional three, 
four or five games to the season. In 
a sport that already has a regular 
season of 12 games in 15 weeks, 
any additional games would create 
a mess of problems ranging from 
extending one of the already longer 
collegiate seasons to having teams 
have to deal with an even greater 
numbers of injuries. I may be a 
sucker for fair competition, but I for 
one like watching my teams com-
pete with all of their players, seeing 
them compete against teams also at 
their full strength and not throwing 
out a starting lineup made up of 
third-stringers and towel boys. 

As I stated before, changing to a 

football playoff system really comes 
down to alienating a traditional 
system. It may be my Oregonian 
roots, but I grew up in a place 
and time where fall meant football 
season — playing under the bright 
lights on Friday night, cheering on 
my favorite colleges on Saturday, 
being an armchair quarterback on 
Sunday and repeating the cycle over 
again until the days grow shorter 
and colder. I came to understand 
that bowl season was the perfect 
interlude between the end of my 
high-school football year and the 
time before the professional football 
playoffs started. This was that amaz-
ing time of the year when school 
was out and you could turn on a 
bowl game at any time and watch 
the culmination of two different 
teams’ achievements, see rivalries 
created and experience the tradition 
of an almost century-old system.  

As the general trend continues to 
push for playoffs that will crown one 
team champion, my question to you 
is whether you really want to see 
college football go in that direction. 
I know that I personally cherish the 
memories of my hometown Oregon 
State University Beavers pulling off 
a 9-4 season this year and ending it 
with a victory in the Emerald Bowl. 
Sure, it’s a far cry from the Fiesta 
Bowl finish of 2001 (and an 11-1 
record), but it is another season 
where my Beavs aren’t at the bottom 
of the Pac-10 Conference and a win 
at the end of the season leaves me 
in high hopes for this fall. The bowl 
system may not be what the Texas or 
Ohio State Universities of the world 
are looking for, but for me, it feels 
great to finish seasons on a high 
note. Again, I will concede that the 
BCS system is not perfect, but I am 
content in knowing that the bowl 
system will be in place at least until 
2014 and will allow small teams like 
my OSU to take part in a time-hon-
ored tradition.

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008

By Rael Enteen
Sports Editor

BASEBALL — After losing their 
first two games of the double-elimi-
nation California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Tournament in Chico on 
May 8 and 9, the No. 11 Tritons’ sea-
son will continue with an invitation to 
the NCAA Division-II Championship 
West Regional, where they will be a 
second seed and play No. 25 Western 
Oregon today.

“I think we were all thoroughly 
disappointed with our showing at the 
conference tournament,” sophomore 
starter Kirby St. John said. “I don’t 
think any of us really felt like we played 
at all up to our potential. We were all 
pretty down, but that’s the thing: you 
have to rebound and let it go and start 
focusing on the next team. And I think 
we did a good job of that: we had three 
really solid practices this week and we 
refocused and I think we’re all in a bet-
ter place now, ready to go.”

In the first-round game on May 8, 
the Tritons faced the tournament host-
ing Wildcats and fell by a 7-4 final score, 
forcing them to play in a pressure-
packed elimination game the next day.

The two conference rivals were 
knotted up in a scoreless tie for the 
first three innings before the Wildcats 
scored a run in the top of the fourth 
and the Tritons responded with one 
of their own in the bottom half. After 
a scoreless fifth inning, Chico State 
put up three runs to take a 4-1 lead 
but UCSD cut the deficit to two with 
a run in the bottom of the sixth. Each 
squad scored one in the seventh inning 
and UCSD added another run in the 
bottom of the eighth to make the score 
5-4 heading into the ninth inning. The 

Wildcats pushed two insurance runs 
across the plate in the top of the ninth 
and the Tritons could not rally in their 
last licks at the plate to fall 7-4.

St. John worked into the ninth but 
took his first loss after a perfect 8-0 
regular season, going 8.2 innings and 
allowing five earned runs.

“I knew [my offense] was battling 
hard for me and I can’t complain; they 
don’t ever give up and that’s one thing 
that our team’s been great at all year,” St. 
John said. “I just knew that I had to try 
to go out there and put up zeroes. I had 
full faith in them and I still do, it just 
didn’t work out for us because a lot of 
things just didn’t go our way that game, 

but that’s baseball for sure.”
After trailing for most of their 

first game and never completing their 
comeback, the Tritons jumped out to 
a 4-0 lead after four innings in their 
second-round matchup with Cal State 
Stanislaus. The Warriors scored a run 
in the fourth and fifth innings to cut 
the Triton lead to 4-2 and then took the 
lead with three runs in their half of the 
seventh inning.

Facing another deficit in the ninth, 
this time UCSD scored on senior 
pinch-hitter Chris Hom’s RBI single 
to tie the game at 5 heading into the 
bottom of the ninth. Freshman reliever 
Tim Shibuya came back out in the bot-

tom of the ninth after already working 
2.2 innings in relief of freshman Guido 
Knudson and allowed one hit, while 
striking out two to force extras.

“We were excited [headed into extra 
innings],” Knudson said. “We got a 
clutch hit from Chris Hom with two 
outs in the ninth. That hit just showed 
us that the game was ours to take and 
everyone was just excited, the energy 
was good and we just didn’t have a 
great 10th inning. But everyone was 
really into the game and so it was pretty 
disappointing losing that game.”

Shibuya came back to work the 10th 

UCSD Can’t Capture CCAA Crown

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN FILE
The Triton bats kept UCSD within striking distance in both of the team’s games in the CCAA tournament, but never could muster enough to pull off a win.

The sunny beaches of Hollywood, Fla., were the recent gathering place for 
esteemed commissioners of the col-
lege football system to determine 
the future of the sport. At the heart 
of the meeting was the topic of a 
plus-one format playoff system pit-
ting the top four Bowl Championship 
Series-ranked teams in a duel for col-

lege football supremacy. The purpose 
of the proposition was to alleviate 
any doubt about the best team in 
the nation by the end of the season, 
granting one team yearlong gloating 
and taunting privileges. 

Perhaps the biggest argument for 
this playoff idea came during the 
2004 season when the undefeated 
Auburn University Tigers were left 
out of the national game. Auburn 
finished the year with a perfect 13-
0, but placed second behind pow-

A BAD IDEA

Novice-Eight Wins Petite Final

SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN FILE
Besides the success of the novice-eight boat, the Tritons also had their varsity-eight finish in second place at the National Invitational Collegiate Regatta.

Contributing Writer

MEN’S CREW — The Tritons saw 
their season come to an end on May 11 
after a tight competition in the National 
Invitational Collegiate Regatta held 
last weekend in Worcester, Mass. The 
men’s varsity-eight boat surged into 
second place during the first day of the 
regatta, earning the Tritons a spot in 
Sunday’s semifinal. The varsity-eight 
team crossed the finish line at 6:11.59, 
five seconds short of first place Trinity 
College, which came in at 6:06.67. 

The Triton lineup included senior 
coxswain Shanti Tharayil, senior Derek 
Huffman (stroke), senior Shawn Hay 
(seven-seat), senior Ryan Andre (six), 
senior Jeff Collett (five), sophomore 
Zachary Hearns (four), sophomore 
Jay Dee Morgan (three), senior Gilbert 
Collins (two) and junior Jonathan 
Lynch (bow). 

Hearns credited Saturday’s success 
to the team’s hard work. 

“Everything came together for us 
and we had a great race,” he said.  

In spite of such a commanding 
heat performance, the Tritons faced 
a tougher racing field during Sunday 
morning’s semifinal, eventually falling 
into sixth place. The team, which later 
in the day competed in the Petite Final, 
took another sixth-place standing with 

a time of 6:14.76.
According to Collins, the variance 

between Saturday and Sunday’s heat 
performances is something the team 
finds difficult to explain, and was not 
due to lack of preparation.

“Obviously the competition gets 
stiffer on day two,” Collins said. “We 
had everything we needed to perform 
at that level; it just didn’t happen.” 

Also competing in the racing action 
on May 11 were two additional UCSD 
boats: the second varsity eight and the 
novice eight. For the Tritons, the regatta 
marked the first time a varsity or junior 
varsity boat made it to a Grand Final. 
The second varsity-eight boat battled 
into second place of their heat with 
a time of 6:07.57, placing them sixth  
out of 18 squads competing. Chasing 
the Tritons were Rochester Institute of 
Technology at 6:08.81 and University 
of Massachusetts at 6:33.13 chased the 
Tritons. Leading the pack during their 
heat was Wesleyan University, which 
beat UCSD by three seconds with a 
time of 6:04.48.

The nine Tritons competing  were 
sophomore coxswain Cameran Biltucci, 
sophomore Michael Sullivan (stroke), 
senior Dave Payne (seven-seat), junior 
Richard Lund (six), senior Nathaniel 
Taylor (five), senior Anthony Rubino 
(four), sophomore Brodie Kaster 
(three), junior Mark Melikian (two) 

and junior Dominic Shiosaki (bow). 
The novice eight contended in a 

fierce neck-and-neck pursuit against 
Hobart College and Williams College 
in the effort to secure a position in the 
Grand Final later that day on May 11. 
The Tritons faced some tough luck as 
they crossed the finish line with a time 
of 6:00.35, only a hairsbreadth away 
from both schools with Hobart claim-
ing a time of 5:59.85 and Williams 
with 6:00.11. Because only the two best 
times from each heat are allowed to 
qualify for the Grand Final, UCSD got 
bumped into the Petite Final pack by a 
matter of two-tenths of a second.

UCSD came in first in the open-
water race, finishing in 6:22.41 and 
cruising ahead of second-place finisher 
Marist College, which crossed the finish 
line seven seconds later. The winning 
group included freshman coxswain 
Shawn Kuo, freshman Justin Gordon 
(stroke), freshman Taylor McClanahan 
(seven-seat), junior David Segal (six), 
freshman Kris Grey (five), senior Erik 
Matson (four), freshman Nerel Winter 
(three), sophomore Dallas Sybrowsky 
(two) and freshman Tim Powers 
(bow).

When asked about the boat’s victo-
ry, Sybrowsky pointed to the extensive 
teamwork and diligent preparation.

WOMEN’S CREW — While the 
men’s season drew to a close in 
Massachusetts, the women’s crew team 
continues its season this weekend at the 
Pacific Coast Rowing Championships 
held in Rancho Cordova, Calif. on May 
17. The Tritons, who recently returned 
from the Western Intercollegiate 
Rowing Championships, held on May 
3 and 4 at Sacramento State’s Aquatic 
Center, bring to the regatta seasoned 
experience and elite competition. 

Last season, UCSD claimed two sec-
ond-place grand finishes at the NCAA 
Division-II Rowing Championships 
in Tennessee. Earlier this month at 
Rancho Cordova, the team had the 
same success when the varsity-eight 
boat took second place in the grand 
finals during the second day of the 
regatta. The Tritons, who led the pack 
until the last five meters, eventually 
dipped into second place behind Seattle 
Pacific University’s boat, which charged 
across the finish line at 7:13.1, just 0.7 
seconds ahead of UCSD’s boat. Jen 
Myers, who is a senior co-captain along 
with senior Kali Webb, was named 
to the Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association’s All-WIRA First Team for 
her stellar racing. 

The second varsity-eight squad 
also put in solid performances on 
May 4, clinching fourth in the Petite 
Final to capture 10th overall. The nine 
Tritons competing were freshman cox-
swain Sneha Somasekar, sophomore 
Jesi Bennett (stroke), sophomore 
Laurel Copenbarger (seven-seat), 
junior Lauren Menzies (six), fresh-
man Kristen Hayashi (five), sopho-
more Jaime Bigwood (four), sopho-
more Summer Austin (three), junior 

Caryn Urbanczyk (2) and sophomore 
Suzanne Chang (bow).

Bursting toward the finish with 
a time of 7:40.1, UCSD trumped 
Humboldt State University and Santa 
Clara University, which trailed the 
Tritons with times of 7:43.2 and 7:44.0, 
respectively. Leading the racing field 
was the University of San Diego with a 
time of 7:17.6.

Varsity-eight member Bennett said 
the squad’s success derived from its 
strength of mind and preperation.  

“I think a lot had to with us real-
izing that we were actual varsity,” she 
said. “Because of the hard practices 
we’ve been having and all the training 
for the national regattas, we were ready 
and able to walk through these boats 
— to step up and race through them 
without a problem.”

The Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships give UCSD the 
chance to return to the NCAA Rowing 
Championships held during the end of 
the month. Even with such seemingly 
large stakes this weekend, the Tritons 
meet this occasion with the match-
ing confidence and alacrity that have 
fueled them throughout their racing 
season. The rowers know they couldn’t 
be more ready. 

“I think everyone on the team is 
really excited to see how we are going to 
do,” Bennett said. “We’ve been training 
all year to see how we will perform. It’s 
just a matter of having the confidence 
to row hard. We know what to expect 
this weekend because we’ve raced these 
teams before. I think we’re more than 
ready because we’ve been working real-
ly hard. As a team we’re really excited 
— excited and nervous.”
