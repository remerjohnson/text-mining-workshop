Patent director 
disputes waste

Editor's note: This article is 
the first of two on the process of 
transferring technology from the 
UC system to the private sector. 
The second part will appear next 
Monday.

A a public university serving 
more than 152,000 student, the 
University of California must 

balance limited resources among 
many needs . One of those needs 
is the increasingly important area 
of technology tran fer - the 
patenting and licensing of 
re earch re ults that have the 
be t chance of gaining practical 
application and benefitting 
society. 

All technology tran fer for the 
UC y tern takes place through a 
little known office of only about 

20 people on the UC Berkeley 
campus. 

"Wecan'tkeepup,"said Roger 
Ditzel, director of the UC Pat-
ent, Trademark and Copyright 
Office. "We have the world's 
biggest portfolio of new tech-
nology, and it keeps getting 
bigger. " 

Of the 23 positions currently 
available at the patent office, 16 
are filled . Two of the vacancies 
will be filled in February, but 
five positions till remain open. 

In an Oct. 18 article in the San 
Francisco Examiner entitled 
"UC Losing Millions on Inven-
tion ," reporter Eric Best docu-
mented a total "breakdown of 
[the] operation [of patenting new 
inventions] that was 'scandalou .' 
The article went on to say that 
"millions of dollar in public 
revenue and countle s job are 
being 10 t each year because UC

On Tuesday, Jan . 19 at 9: 15 
am school closed down due to 
the fire and sanitation hazard 
of low water pressure, result-
ing, in part, from the weekend's 
storm. 

Problems were first noticed 
on Sunday evening when the 
City of San Diego Water Com-
mission warned school officials 
of a lack of water pressure. 
Upon people returning to cam-
pus on Tuesday morning and 
using water, the problem 
became more acute. 

"There wasn 't enough pre -
sure for the thousands and 
thousands of toilets ," said 
George Himel, associate vice-
chancellor of Business Affairs , 
at a press conference Tuesday 
morning. He also expressed 
concern over the need for the 
Douse showers in the labs for 
acid washes. 

There is a major line break in 
the Eastgate-Miramar area on 
the east side of campus which is 
still being repaired as of Wed-
nesday morning. By tracing 
pipes to the source of the mis-
take, the water company found 
that water had been routed 
incorrectly around the break . 
Those problems, in addition to 
pump problems in some of the 

other reservoirs , aggravated the 
situation. 

When the campus closed , the 
pumps were operating at 271bs. 
of pressure. They need a min-
imum of 40 Ibs. to operate, but 
the optimum is 60 Ibs. 

Apparently, only the upper 
campus at Revelle, Muir and 
Third campuses were the hard-
est hit by extremely low water 
pressure, though the entire 
campus had lower pressure. 

The administration brought 
in 90 Porta-Potties, but had 
200 on order in case of a longer 
interru ption of water. The dorm 
food services had bottled water 
for residents. Entrances were 
manned with police officers to 
tell people to go back home, 
though they let people in who 
live on campus, or needed to do 
research. 

Initially, administrative offi-
cials and departments were told 
that people could stay and work 
if they wished. Later, however, 
police locked people out of 
buildings, with the exception of 
dorms and apartments. At the 
press conference Tuesday 
morning, Himel reassured the 
staff that they will be paid for 
their day off. 

The only staff that remained 
on campus involved personnel 
from Physical Plant Services,

A new vein 
of artificial 
vessel research 
By JOHN A. WEBSTER 

LOS ALAMOS - Research 
at Los Alamos National Labora-
tory may lead to the develop-
ment of artificial blood vessels 
that would be commercially avail-
able for human implantation. 

Debra Wrobleski, a chemist at 
Lo Alamos, described the exper-
imental work recently during the 
national meeting of the Ameri-
can Chemical Society in New 
Orleans. 

Except for large blood vessels, 
natural materials are now used 
for vascular implants in humans. 
For instance, one of the first 
steps in a heart bypass operation 
is to remove blood vessels from 
the patient's leg so they can be 
used to bypass the damaged 
arteries of the heart. 

The use of plastics to replace 
veins and arteries has been res-
tricted by the tendency of blood 
to clot when it comes into con-

tact with the artificial material. 
The reaction can close the pas-
sageway or send a dangerous 
clot circulating through the 
bloodstream. 

Wrobleski and her Los Ala-
mos co-workers have been stud-
ying ways to alter the surface of 
polymeric plastics in ways to 
reduce the chance that the blood 
will react adversely with the arti-
ficial material. 

" It would be nice to have small, 
synthetic vessels that do not close 
or cause the blood to clot," 
Wrobleski said . 

There could be significant 
medical applications for heart 
bypass operations, she said . 

"Physicians could have some-
thing commercially available in-
stead of being forced to use a 
natural vein. And the benefit of 
having artificial blood vessels 
immediately available in emer-
gencies is obvious." 

"The initial results 
show that the tech-
nique of treating the 
surfaces is promising, 
but we still need to do 
a lot of work." 

-Debra Wrobleski 

The Los Alamos researchers 
are using a process called chemi-
cal infusion to mOdify the sur-
face of polymeric plastics with-
out chan~ing fundamental prop-
erties, such as strength and flexi-
bility, that make the materials 
biologically useful as synthetic 
blood vessels. 

In the chemical infusion pro-
cess, the polymeric material is 
placed into a so lution that soften 
the su rface. The solution is 
gradually diluted, allowing the 
material to harden with new 
chemicals "infused" in to the 
surface. 

Tht; researchers' experiments 
have a twofold thrust: using the 
infusion technique to chemically 
alter the outer surface of poly-
meric plastics, then testing the 
treated surface biologically to 
find out if it is compatible with 
blood . 

A wide range of experimental 
conditions have been used in the 
research, including varying the

The Delta Co rporation would

Due to the revenue potential 
of the Delta Corporation, Bay

Fitting the Greek system into UCSD 
By DAVID BROOKS 

Nearly a decade ago National 
Lampoon released "Animal 
House," an enormously succe s-
ful parody of fraterni ty life. The 
film made millions and left an 
imprint on a generation of future 
college-goer . By no coincidence 
1978 was the year that fraterni-
ties "took a major [upwards] 
swing," according to Dan Rod-
riguez, UCSD's Inter-Fraternity 
Council (l FC) advisor. 

With society still. bearing the 

burden of the Vietnam era, the 
success of "Animal House" 
helped to replenish the dwindling 
numbers of fraternity men. Yet 
the film's succes has been a 
mixed omen for those active in 
the Greek system. 

The film helped to rejuvenate 
the interest of college tudents 
who were still recuperating from 
the brunt of the Vietnam War 
while at the same time it labeled 
fraterni tie as drinking clubs 
whose sole Objective was to party, 
a misconception that still plagues 

today's fraternities. 
Are UCS D' fraternities 

merely drinking cl ubs? Most 
would say definitely not, incl ud-
ing Rodriguez, who feel that the 
Greek ystem is a "misunderstood 
organization ." The problem, 
according to Rodriguez, is that 

. "people don't understand what 
Greeks are all about. The Greek 
system allows for the individual 
to lea rn interpersonal kills . It's 
a chance for leadership role and 
educational experiences. Parties 
are just one aspect of Greek

sion will be approximately the fifth week ofthe

The new university center, scheduled 10 open 
in the fall of 1988, may change student life at 
UCSO forever. The University Center Board 
(UCB) has worked out most of the final details. 
but they have yet to decide which student 
organizations will be granted office space in the 
new building. 

Final recommendations of the UCB regard-
ing the office space will be submitted by the 
eighth week of the quarter. The UCB is an 
offshoot of the old Student Center Board. The 
new name was coined in sprinS of 1987 when 
the need arose for a student-run committee to 
plan for the new center. 

The university center will house seven fast 
food restaurants as well as four retail stores. 
There will be a grand ballroom that will 
accommodate either 1,500 seated or 2,000 
standing as well as a 500-seat lecture hall to be 

Dan Rodriguez. an IFC adviser. feels thai the Greek system has

-imallllt the career you wan! In the countr r you klve Japtl n 

from SDSU . UCSD is definitely 
not one of the top 10 party 
sc hools . Most fraternities [at 
UCSD] really stress academics 
much more than anything else." 
This is not to say that UCSD's 
fraternities are comatose; Fish 
added that even though there are 
no "big. all-night parties [the 
Greeks] definitely party." 

By most accounts, however, 
UCSD is considered a relatively 
tame ca mpu . The fact that cur-
rent frate rnities and sororities 
have no " Greek Row" has con-
tributed to UCSD's quiet repu-
tation on the social scene. Fish 
admitted that with UCSD's fra-
ternity members often scattered 
from Mission Beach to Solana 
Beac h it is nothing Ie s than a 
struggle for the UCSD Greek 
sy!>tem to appear con olidated. 

Acco rding to Dr. Joseph Wat-
son, Vice-Chancellor for U nder-
graduate Affairs, there are cur-
rently no pla ns for any form of a 
Greek Row. Instead, the unive r-
sity 's emphasis is on providing 
on-campus housing for all stu-
dents who wish to live on cam-
pus. With the exception of an 
" International House" that will 
acco mmodate undergraduate 
and graduate students from all 
five co ll eges (including Fifth 
Co llege) , UCSD is focusing on 
building traditional form s of 
hou si ng. 

See GREEK, page 6 

Center 
Continued from pace 4 
used for class during the day and 
for movies at nighl. There will be 
ATM machines, a well as the 
office space for student organi-

. za tions . The new bookstore will 
be three tories high. The center 
will also have eight meeting 
rooms. Round Table Pizza will 
hold the campus' beer and wine 
license - in essence it will 
become the campus pub . 

" We want everybody to go 
through the student center a t 
least once a da y, it's going to 

become everybody's hang out," 
said Evan Weisenfeld , UCB 
chair. Students will have priority 
for reserving the center's facili-
ties , followed the faculty and 
staff, the a lumni, and, lastly, the 
community, according to Wei-
senfeld . 

"It's going to ~e like a mall, 
but it's going to be even better 
because it's going to be for the 
students," said Andy Chane, 
UCB vice-chair. Chane admitted 
that parking for the university 
center is "going to be a prob-
lem." He said that at the time of 
the center's completion, there 
will not be adequate parking 

available. There are future plans 
for the construction of a parking 
structure nearby, but it will be a 
whi le before these plans come 
into effect, Chane added . 

The university center will be 
named the Price Center, after 
Sol Price, founder of the Price 
C lub. Price , a San Diego native, 
donated $2 million to the univer-
sity center . This is the largest 
donation received by UCSD 
campus to date , and the first ever 
donated to a student-run build-
ing. 

The present student center will 
remain in operation, but there 

will be some reshuffling of office 
space, according to need s, said 
Weisenfeld. The UCB created a 
task force to look into the reor-
ganization and to advise the UCB 
on the space needs of the indi-
vidual organizations. Ground-
works, the General Store, and 
the Grove Caffe will all stay, and 
perhaps expand. While many 
student organizations, such as 
the A.S., will move to the univer-
sity center, some organizations 
will move into the student cen-
ter, such as the Guardian. 

The task force has been allot-
ted $500,000 for student center 
renovation. The outside struc-

ture will remain basically the 
same, but the office spaces will 
be orga nized . The task force's 
duties - final recommendations 
to the UCB on individual organ-
izations' needs - will be com-
pleted by the end of this quarter. 

The Triton Pub will no longer 
exist when the new center opens . 
The building will remain availa-
ble to students for parties and 
special functions, but the Pub 
itself ~ ill be replaced in concept 
by Round Table Pizza in the 
university center. The Triton 
Pub's owners chose not to renew 
their beer I wine license in the 
university center. [ill

Greek 
Continued from page 4 

Without a Greek Row, much 
of the reponsibility for holding 
the Greek system together has 
been relegated to the IFC, a rela-
tively new organization. Estab-
lished in 1984, the IFC consists 
of representatives of the "recog-
nized" fraternities (current ly 

there are three other fraternities 
seeking IFC membership) who 
meet on a regular basis . I FC 
President Fish cites the role of 
the I FC as a "go-between [for] 
the administration and fraterni-
ties" and an arbiter for potential 
conflicts among the fraternities. 

The power of the I FC comes 
from its ability to draw upon the 
resources of all IO of U CS O's 
recognized fraternities . Last year, 
however, the UCSO administra-

ble for ba nning Tau K.appa 
Epsilon from this past fall's rush 
activities . 

In an effort to handle such 
problems in the future, the I FC 
is currently establishing a Judi-
cial Board. Though Watson feels 
that there is "no reason to res-
trict the number of Greek organ-
izations, .. the IFC has outlined 
a n expansion policy that will 

invite only a few new fraternities 
onto campus over a period of 
time. 

Though the prospect for a 
Greek Row is quite small, IFC 
advisor Rodriguez is optimistic 
about the future for Greek 
organizations at UCSO: "UCS O 
is so dynamic. Greek life can 
really flourish if [the fraternities 
and sororities] do the right things 
to attract students. We can have 
a fantastic system." (Q] 

Correction: 
In the Jan . 14 article on 

the Peace Corps. Joan Clab-
by's quote "They have to 
please Reagan" was inadver-
tently attributed to Bill Clab-

to the Peace Corps as the 
context suggested. The Guar-
dian regrets these errors.

SWIM FAGS - Men's A Basketball 
This week's Bud team honors go to a team that lives by the 

intramural motto "It's not how you play, it's how you look." These 
swimmers might have their sports slighlty confused, but there are no 
objections from bewildered onlookers. Their sparse uniforms include 
Air Jordans, speedos and nothing else. It doesn't matter jf they have a 
winning season because their recognition comes from the style, not 
the sport. Besides, they can't play any worse than they lookl After this 
article appears, expect maximum capacity crowds in the gym, with 
the male-to-female ratio not expected to disappoint the players. 

This is definitely a group of genuine Bud Men. Yes, we are in ther 
midst of celebrities. Keep your eyes open UCSD - contract terms for 
an upcoming Swim F-ts calendar are being negotiated. 

UCSD SUPERSTARS SET TO COMPETE! 

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 
SUPERSTARS ALL-IPORTS COMPETITION 

MOVES TO EARUER DATEI 
UCSD's annual search lor the most talented 

all -around men and women athletes on campus 
is back In the news again. And even though the 
lormat Will remain standard as it has for the past 
t3 years, the dates of thiS year's four-day com-
petition has been moved ahead on the calendar 
Irom ItS normatlate February spot. 

The 13th Annual UCSD Superstars All-Sports 
Competition IS set lor Thursday through Sunday, 
February 4-7 and Will be contested on most of 
UCSD's athletic / recreation venues. 

For the uninitiated, the Superstars competition 
has a rtch tradition of showaslng the finest all -
around athletes on our campus In a four -day, ten 
event test 01 Skill, speed, power and endurance. 

Structured similar to the Olympic decathalon 
competllion, individuals compete In a unique 
combination of sporls skill events With each mark 
scortng pOInts on the Superstars POints Table. 

ThiS year's competition should teature another 
temfic wire-to-wlre battle for the title. In 1987, 
UCSD vars ity baseballer JJ Fisher nosed out 
former Superstars champ Doug Roche In his 
final event Fisher's 6132 point total was the 
second highest In Superstars history. 

Fisher and Roche are both back along With 
perenn ial third-place statwart Robert Vacheron 
who Just missed the coveted 6000 (;Olnt bamer. 
Also giVing It the old college try Will be Glenn 
Creswell, Philip Vacheron . and Ross Rattay, 

last years fourth, Sixth and seventh finishers 
respectively. 

Last year's Women's champion was LaUrie 
O'Connell, who established a phenomenal all-
time mark of 5832. She has graduated, but her 
running mate Mary Beth Murray is sixth on the 
ali -time women's list and should be back for 
another whirt at the point tabtes. 

Belore anyone gets the Idea that you have to 
be the most awesome of at hletes to compete. let 
us set the record straight. This competition is 
open to everyone on campus (students, that Is). 
And you need not be awesome in any event to do 
welt. In fac t most of our high Ilnlshers post good 
solid marks in each event, rather than set ling 
school records In a lew. 

UCSD Superstars otters team competi tion as

hiatus writer 

Bill Forsyth, the Scottish 
director of such films as 
"Local Hero," and "Gregory's 
Girl" (among others) pro-
bably would have loved to 
have been given the chance to 
direct "Moonstruck." All the 
Forsyth trademarks are here: 
strong-willed but slightly off-
kilter characters , most of 
whom are, for reasons they 
can't explain, just a trifle un-
happy with their lives . Finally, 
there is the whimsy, which I'll 
get to later. 

As it is, "Moonstruck" is a 
Norman Jewison film, and it's 
quite good . Unfortunately, 

UCSD UNlVERSITY EVENTS & STUDENT AcnVlTIES PRESENTS 

Jewison and screenwriter John 
Patrick Shanley tend to be just 
a bit too serious, and the film 
is almost thrown off balance. 

But along comes Cher, who 
can no longer be considered a 
folly . Her presence as Loretta 
Castorini is so powerful, so 
captivating, that she not only 
provides the core of the film, 
she is the film. Imagining 
"Moonstruck" without Cher 
would be like imagining "The 
C610r Purple" without 
Whoopi Goldberg; never has 
a star been more enchanting. 

Loretta Castorini is a con-
tent, but not quite happy, 
woman. She has had a run of

Lawrence Baird is the name 
of the accredited psychologist 
who heads the Cicero County 
Correctional Mental Facility. 
It is also the name that con 
man John Burns (Dan Aykroyd) 
borrows when he takes over 
the radio show of a rich Los 
Angeles sex therapist. 

W utter Matthau and Dan Aykrayd star in "The Covch Trip." 
:;:; with me bond? ;:;: 

:l~ 4 . What Slore do the I\eplocemenl5 hail from? t 

The fact that Burns replaces 
the usual psychologist's advice 
with ideas that actually make 
sense is one of the reasons that 
"The Couch Trip" isso funny. 
The other reasons are per-
formances by Aykroyd, 
Charles Grodin as pop shrink 
George Maitlin, and Walter 
Matthau as the half crazy, tho-
roughly repulsive misfit 
Donald Becker. 

The screen play which is 
based on a novel by Ken Kolb, 
is less than brilliant, but it 
gives the actors plenty of room 
to show off their comedic 
skills. Burns starts out as an 
inmate in a mental institution, 
which he prefers to prison, 
which is his only other alter-
native. 

When he receives a phone 
call meant for Dr. Baird (David 
Clennon), the sadistic bum 

who is in charge of the asylum, 
and is offered a chance to take 
over the million dollar a year 
practice of George Mailin, he 
jumps at the opportunity. 

After a ludicrously easy 
escape, 'Burns arrives in Los 
Angeles and begins his prac-
tice like any true psychologist 
would, by extorting $200,000 
from Maitlin's shyster lawyer 
(Richard Romanus). 

Burns' performance on the 
talk show makes him an in-
stant celebrity, especially when 
he offers a free therapy ses-
sion. It also provides the set-
ting for some of the funniest 
scenes in the movie, as he 
answers the calls of mentally 
disturbed Southern Cali-
fornians, and when he deals 
with a mob of troubled fans as 
they form outside his office 
for more treatment. 

Burns is not without prob-
lems. He is a fugitive who 
could be arrested at any time.

Sizzling songs 
by larry weintraub 

hiatu8 writer 

One of the best and no 
doubt most visible bands on 
the Lawndale based record 
label, SST, is the Southern 
California trio, Firehose. With 
their second contribution to 
vinyl, Firehose has delivered a 
fantastic 14 song compilation 
in the form of "If'n." 

Originally belonging to the 
famed band, the Minutemen, 
members of Firehose set out 
on their own after the death of 
leader , D. Boon. Backed by a 
loyal following and the sup-
port of SST Records, Firehose 
produced their first album, 
"Ragin', Full-On." The album 
received high' critical acclaim, 
and gained them a new and 
supportive following. 

In the wake of their first 
album, the band earned a rep-
utation as one of the most vis-
ible bands in Southern Cal-
ifornia due to their extensive 
performance schedule. Pro-
pelled by variety and personal 
charisma, band members: 
bassist Mike Watt, guitarist 
and singer Ed Fromohio, and 
drummer George Hurley, were 
welcomed into the overly com-
petitive L.A. local music 
scene. 

Between live gigs in which 
Firehose found themselves 
either headlining or opening 
for such bands as the Meat 
Puppets (fellow label-mates), 
the band has managed to re-

lease their second album, 
"If'n ." Similar to their last 
album, ''If'n'' is a mixture of 
original material highlighted 
with catchy rock tunes, driv-
ing bluesy rhythms, and bass-
backed monologues. 

What makes this band and 
this album different than most 
of the currently emerging 
bands from L.A. 's under-
ground, is their diversity and 
originality. "If'n" clearly' ex-
emplifies these characteristics 
with such diverse songs as the 
potenti a 11 y-co m me rei a I, 
"Honey, Please" and Mike 
Watts' throbbing recitals on 
"Operation Solitaire" and 
"Me & You, Remembering." 

"If'n" is filled with a collage 
of insightful songs stretching 
from a tribute to L.A. 's free-
way shootings, in "Making 
the Freeway," to an incredible 
re-creation of the Athen's 
Georgia sound on, "For the 
Singer of R.E.M." Noted fav-
orites are the previously men-
tioned, "Honey, Please," the 
album opener, "Sometimes," 
and the eloquent, "Windmil-
ling." "In Memory of Eliza-
beth Cotten" is an enjoyable 
song in which the band is 
joined by L.A. folk singer, 
Phranc. 

As innovative and creative 
as "Ragin'. Full-On" was, 
"If'n" picks up where "Ragin" 
left off. With this newest of 
songs "If'n" stands to cast 
Firehose back into the fore-
front of today's music. 

Ethical Treatment of Plants,"

escaped mental p'atient and is 
blackmailing him into "shar-
