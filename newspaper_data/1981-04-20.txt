AS calls a convention, 
but practically nobody 
s'hows up to participate 
38 listen to debate on 
constitution; action postponed 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
tafl Writer 

Maybe there was a good 
movie showing on campu -
at least Aetas de Marusia was 
sho wing for free in 
Mandeville Auditorium. 

Perhaps the Muir Cafeteria 
was featuring an exciting 
dessert. 

Or perhap , as has been 
suggested in the past, UCSD 
tudents couldn't care less 

about campus government. 
Whatever the case, 

students obviously were not 
attracted to last Thursday's 
AS constitutional conven-
tion, hailed by student 
officials as a "unique 
opportunity for students to 
play a role in restructuring 
their government." 

Only 38 students at most 
gathered in TLH 107 for the 
event, the first in recent AS 
history. 

And nearly half of those are 
or have been affiliated with 
the AS, a situation even AS 
president Bill Topkis, who 
ran the convention, and AS 
Commissioner of Student 
Welfare Reggie Williams 
admit "defeats the purpose" 
of an open convention. 

Before any discussion on 
the current and proposed 
structu res of student 
government could take place, 
delegate Ron David, who is 
not affiliated with the AS, 
moved to suspend the 
convention, "until the 
proposed constitutions and 
the convention can be better 
pu blicized. " 

After an hour of what one 
delegate called "senseless 
prattle," the tudents voted 
to reconvene on April 30 at 6 
pm in TLH 107. 

David's proposal wa met 
with immediate upport by 
participant, including 

Student Body Pre idents 
Council Chairwoman Linda 
Sabo, who argued that 
"(these) 31 students hardly 
represent the 9,000 under-
graduates at UCSD." 

And Revelle sophomore 
Randy Hill favored postpon-
ing the convention because 
the constitution he helped 
write - the only one not 
written by an AS member-
was not yet ready for 
circulation. 

But a handful of delegates 
favored continuing the 
convention despite the small 
turnout. 

"We should carryon and 
perform the functions of the 
convention," said AS Vice 
President Warren Wheeler, 
who authored one of the 
p,roposed constitutions. 
'There's been a considerable 

level of advertising - how 
can waiting a week make 
more people show up?" 

And one woman attending 
told fellow delegates, "I read 
about this thing and came, so 
let's do something. There's a 
lot of apathy at this campus. 
You're not going to get many 
more (students) than this 
here." 

Jon Bekken, AS presiden-
tial contender and Progre -
sive Coalition member, called 
the turnout "fairly signifi-
cant...considering the AS and 
what it's done for students." 
He suggested that the 
delegates hold some "pre-
liminary di cuss ion on the 
general proposals that now 
exist." 

After voting to ban 
themselve from passing any 
pecific con titutions and 

from adjourning permanent·

Is Bagneris 'hand~capped 
in bid for AS office? 
Can a Black win 
the Presidency? 

BY PAUL FARWELL 
taU Writer 

It's a bigger issue than the AS election, 
but the election is serving as a mirror for 
something that bubbles under the surface of 
UCSD - raci m. 

Doe a Black person have a chance to get 
elected AS president here? 

Jules Bagneris, a Black and presidential 
candidate on the "Respect with 
Perspective" s late, hopes it won't. 

"Mostly," Bagneris said, "} hope the 
issues are pre ented in a way that looks at 
the qualifications of the individual and not 
at his skin color." 

But he added, "UCSD is a microcosm of 
the real world. Gust like any election), 
Blackness will be made an issue. I don 't hide 
that I'm Black; I'm Black and I'm proud. 
That's not to say that I'm going to do things 
that are not in the interests of all students. to 

If Bagneris were'to be elected he would be 
the first Black AS president at UCSD. 

Historically, Blacks rarely run for high AS 
offices. In fact, last year was the first time at 
UCSD a Black had run for AS president 
(Robert Tambuzi) and this year is the first 
time an all-Black slate has run. 

Ken Overton, president of the Black 
Students Union, feels that many UCSD 
students are too close-minded to vote for a 
Black candidate. 

"You have to understand that the average 
(parental) income at this school is around 60 
to 70 thousand dollars," he said. "Students 
from that background tend to (be less 
receptive to the idea of a Black president) 
than people who come from Black or 
Chicano communi tie . to 

Linda Sabo, chairwoman of the Student 
Body Presidents' Council and the first 
woman to qualify for a run-off for AS 
president (last year), echoed the same 
sentiment . Sabo believes that Bagneris's 
success will depend on tudent' attitude 
toward Third World people . In the pa t, he 
said, "A lot of raci m, sexi m and 
homophobia" ha proliferated on the UCSD 
campus. 

Along with racism, Bagneris faces the 
political danger of being labeled a pecial 
inter t, a term whi h h f I fatally 
wounded Tambuzi' campaign. 

"The wav (the label) wa applied (by the 

Jules Bagneris 

!l1edia) w~s bad. Tambuzi wasn't a special 
mterest SImply because the issues he dealt 
with were issues which concerned the 
student body as a whole," Bagneris said. 

"Students automatically get the idea" 
Overton noted, "(that Bagneris represents 
only Black interests) when they see him 

ru~ni~g o~ an all-~Iack s,late. (Students) get 
thIS fIrst ImpreSSIOn WIthout li tening to 
what a candidate has to say." 

Demita Davis, coordinator of Bagneris's 
campaign, says the special interest label has 
been a hard obstacle to overcome. 
. "In our campaign, we've tried to keep the 
Issue of Black~ess.dowt:l,:' she said, adding 
that the campaIgn IS poittlcal and not racial. 

~ut how well Bagneris does will 
ulttmately depend on the aesthetics of hi 
campaign. Paraphenalia like posters and 
buttons will playa very important part in 
Wednesday' and Thursday's election. 
. And Bagneris will probably spend thi 

fmal week of the campaign looking for hand 
to shake. 

Said Sabo, veteran of several AS elections 
"the more people he can get to upport hi~ 
- no. matter the d~ree, even if it means ju t 
:-veanng a campal~n button - will greatlr. 
tncrea e the effecttvene of his campaign. ' 

One member of this year' AS, who asked 
~ot to be identifi~, t~ink that Bagneris has 
Itttle chance of wtnntng - partly for racial 
rea ons but mostly for political rea on .

AS constitutional convention misdirected 
Editor: 

This evening I attended the 
first session of the current 
UCSD Constitutional 
Convention. I found it an 
interesting exercise in 
frustration - something I 
thought I'd left behind when I 
left the military for academe. 
Some of the delegates seemed . 
to relish their parts as 
constipation in the body 
politic by blocking moves to 
discuss pertinent issues. 
Once we did begin to discuss 
'constitutional' is ues, most 
dived right into pecifics o~ 
the various p'rQPosed 
constitutions. It i my belief 
that we should first discuss 
basics and generalities first. 
The purpose of a constitu-
tional convention is, 
presumably, to draft a new 

- constitution, not necessarily 
, to give an im/Wimalur to an 

off-the-shelf constitutional 
draft_ 

So, basically, what is it we 
want a student government 

to do? As an outsider (outside 
current AS government) I 
believe an effective student 
government shou ld, first , 
represent all the students . 
Second, the representatives 
must meet in some forum 
that allows an open 
disucussion of relevant 
issues. That is, issues 
relevant to the student body. 
Relevance is, of course, a 
loaded word. While it might 
be nice to express support for 
the terrific job being done by 
Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe 
I somehow feel finding a way 
to make women at UCSD safe 
from rape more relevant to 
UCSD student at this time 
an'd place . Hence the 
chairperson(s) of the 
representative body (or 
bodies) should be in a position 
to limit debate. That, 
however, is an issue to be 
addressed in rules for 
governin~ the legislature. A 
constitutIon should, again, 
provide a workable forum for 

Story not accur'ate 
Editor: 

Your article "Armitage 
Assures Daycare Posts" 
(Guardian. April 2) alleging 
that I wrote a letter to day 
care parents "deploring their 
'show offorce'" is inaccurate. 
irresponsible and totally 
misrepresenting my position 
on the day care question. No 
such letter w as written or 
endorsed by me. I wrote to 
Cathy Valerio, Chairperson, 
Registration Fee Committee. 
discouraging the 'show of 
force' organized by intercol-
legiate athletes and their 
coaches at her March 3 
meeting. The day care 
funding was considered 
earlier at that meeting and 
was rejected. 

I would like to mention 
that I very strongly support 
the Day Care Center and 
would like to see it expanded 
so that every student that 
wants to use it can do so. I 
talked to Vice Chancellor 
Armitage after the March 3 
meeting offering my support 
for his plans to override the 
Regi tration Fet; Committee 

deci ion not to fund the two 
CET A workers. 

I had also requested the 
graduate student representa-
tive, Judy Liu, to ask that the 
day care fund reque t be put 
on the agenda for their March 
12 meeting ince I was 
informed that some members 
that abstained from voting at 
the March 3 meeting were 
now willing to support the 
fund request. The Registra-
tion Fee Committee voted on 
this day to fund the CETA 
workers. 

At the Graduate Student 
Council meeting of March 12, 
the COllncil members voted 
unanimous ly to support the 
Day Care Center and to 
request that the Registration 
Fee Committee not request 
another referendum on the 
day care issue. A letter to this 
effect is now being written. 

I hope this clarifies my 
po ition and actions 
regarding day care.

the represen i at i ves to 
discus s st udent issues. 
Third, effective student 
government should efficient-
ly administer programs 
established for and by the 
students using student body 
funds . 

This all being. the case I 
would suggest something 
along the lines of a 
unicameral feder~ organiza-
tion. In such an organization 
there wou ld be separate 
executive and one-house 
legislative branches. The ke 
here is to keep the 
organization simple and easy 
to administer. 
Legislative 

The proposal :-vas made 
tonight that students be 
represented according to 
their major s instead of 
according to which college 
they are enrolled ·in. While I 
would not discount this 
method out of hand (and 
applaud it author for his 
open-mindedness) I would 
have to be convinced it would 
not be difficult to hold 
elections with one's major 
being the criterion for 
determining how many 
representatives one has in 
the legislature. The way it 
would eem to work would be 
for all students in a 
particular major to elect a 
certain number of represen-
tatives based on the student 
population in that major. (For 
example. the 1900 biology 
majors could each vote for 6 
representatives while the 320 
economics majors could each 
vote for 3 repre entatives.) 
This type of system is 
inherently unequal and even 
though I have few illusions 
about a genuine problem 
arising over majors voting in 
the legislature en bloc. 
something just feels wrong 
about such a system, One 
man. er, one person vote is too 
strongly rooted in me for this 
system to really grab me. 

I would prefer to see a 
~egis lature made upof a fairly 

large numberof students (say 
40) elected from each colege 
(in this case, 10 from each 
college). I ret urn to the college 
as the basic electoral division 
for lack of a more workable 
division. Just as US senator 
are elected two from each 
state regardless of each 
state's population, so would 
our student legis lators be 
apportioned. Of course. I 
would be amenable to a 
s ugges ti on of another 
electoral division so that each 
representatiove might 
represent a fixed number of 
(dare I use the word ?) 
constituents. 

The legislature should · 
propose and enact legis lation 
binding on the executive and 
should not ~et bogged down 
with admimstering. I would 
suspect that annual budget 
preparations-would. thus, be 
the main and most important 
function of the legislature. If 
the legislature has no 
business to conduct except 
for two or three weeks a year, 
why must it meet at regular 
intervals? In many states, 
service in the state 
legislature is a part-time job 
that only lasts about one 
month per year . Should an 
emergency arise requiring 
immediate legislative 
attention, the chairperson 
should be en powered to call a 
special ession within a set 
period of time. 
Executive 

As mu t have been guessed 
by now I advocate a strong 
executive. I would have a 
studen t body presiden t, 
prime minister, pooh bah or 
whatever at the head of a 
cabinet that was elected at 
large. Cabinet officer or 
mini te r would control 
funds in accordance with the 
directives of the legis lature 
and could have elected 
as istants Gust a possibility) 
working for them. The job 
descriptions of the cabinet 
level posts and executive 
hould be written into the 

constitution in some detail. 
Thus in order to add or delete 
cabinet posts, constitutional 
amendments would be 
required, Also, with detailed 
job descriptions written into 
a constitution , cabinet 
offi ers and the executive 
could be held accountable for 
their actions, and recall 
procedures would put the 
executive officers on notice to 
do a goodjobor say ' bye-bye.' 
While not a requirement, the 
executive and hi cabinet 
could very well be apolitical 
- serving the student body 
at large instead of a 
particular constituency in 
the guise of the student body 
at large. I would advocate the 
elimination of s lates of 
candidates and let each 
candidate for each post run 
by himlherself. This is in 
keeping with the administra-
tive nature I envision for the 
executive branch. 

The main reasons for my 
advocacy of strong executive 
separate from the legislature 
are: (a) accountability is 
insured; and (b) government 
would be more responsive to 
the collective . will, as 
expre sed by the legislature, 
s ince actual governing (i.e. 
day -to-day running of 
student affairs) would not be 
done by committee. 

These suggestions are not 
blueprints for a new tudent 
government but are merely 
my thoughts on the purpose 
of studen t government at 
UCSD and a way to fu lfill 
that purpos e. I w elcome 
further debate and hope all 
UCSD undergrad s will 
consider attending the next 
session of the constitutional 
convention, to be held on 
April 30, at 6 pm, tentatively 
in TLH 107. Student 
government can work for 
you , can be fun and need not 
be limited to a small clique of 
people looking for another 
resume entry.

Vote on nuke labs 
Editor: 

This week students at 
UCSD and UC SantaBarbara 
will vote on whether the 
University of California 
should continue manage-

Livermore and LQs Alamos 
Nuclear Weapons laborato-
ries. 

The main arguments for 
and against the UC-Weapons 
Labs connection are: 

Pro-labs - The Univer-

sity manages the weapons 
labs as a public service to 
further national security 
interests. The University's 
reputation draws many 
eminent scientists to the 
labs. In addition, the labs 
serve purposes other than 
nuclear weapons develop-

University should continue 
its management of the labs.

Editor: 

Recreation facil ities : we need 
them!. Our lone overcrowded pool has 
long hnes of people waiting to swim. 
We can't use our playing fields after 
dark because they don't have lights 
(even my high school had a lighted 
field! ) We don't have allY standard 
size racquetball courts. 

The cost of new facili tie is going 
up at a n astronomical rate. If we 
don't go for it now w e won 't beable to 
in t he future. Our facilities are a 
bargain now. 

Changing int erest rates require 
room to operate in the ·tudent 

recreation faci lities charter. No one 
can know the exacI rate until the 
bonds are sold to finance our project. 
The proposed change in the charter 
allows for Ihis variability and 
maintains s tudent conlrol. 

Vote "xes" to amend the Charter 
and "yes ' for new tud nt recrea tion 
fac ilities. Without thi change they 
cannot be built.

The Student Recreation Facilit ie 

Project is entering the final phase of 
finan cial planning for Regental 
approval . The projecI , consisting of a 
new swimming pool. racquet ball 
court. Muir Field light ing and 
additional locker/ howerroom pace, 
was originally approved by a three to 
one margin in an all- tudent vote 
almost two years ago. A low voter 
turnout made th e re ults of that vot 
non· binding. 

A special feature of the charter 
called for no student fee until 
complet ion of I he physica l facilitie . 
Another peeial feature ensured 
student control of the facilities by 
preventing an y changes in the 
charter wit hout a direct all-st udent 
vote. Thi provi ion leaves little 
leeway if any if the original financi ng 
plans are forced to change. 

The finan ci ng schedule ca lled for a 
bank loan to cover construct ion co ts, 
the loan to be repaid over a 25-year 
period. Two years ago, when the 
chedule was originally formulated. 

the loan 's inlere t rat e could be 
predicted well enough to a llow the 
specific student fee to be written into 
the charter. The e la t two years 
ha ve een unexpectedly wild 
variations in Jnterest rates. Banks 
will no longer make longterm loans at 
fixed rates, thus forcing a change in 
financing plan . 

Fortunately. there is an alternate 
financing method via the sale of 
bonds by the Regents. A sui table bond 
issue is already approved for 1983, 
about the s ame time as the 
completion of our facilities. The bond 
repayment covers a 3D-year period. 
But the s ame problem with the 

interest rate sti ll applies .. Noonecan 
know I he exact rate until the bonds 
are sold two years from now, after the 
completion of our facilitie . 
. "'(e can, however, et an upper

be . le ·s .. This variability must be 
wntt en IOto the charter now, prior to 
construction. 

.We Plopo e that the exact dollar 
amount not be pecified and that the 
wording now read: 

" Shall the s tudents of the 
Oniver ity of California at San Diego

Nat.atorium, and night lightingon the 
MUIr Field, said Facilitie to be 
governed by the Student Recreation 
Facilities Charter?" 

No other change are required . 
Also, we have re-examined the 
inflation factQrs in the construction 
cost estimates, and they Jlre till 
va lid . .

Police ""eak up CARP rally 
Physical confrontation between. Moon·backed group's supporters, antagonists 

contilHll'd fro III page I K 
prodding them off the steps 
and shouting " Fascists go 
home." 

Three campus police 
officers finally inteJ:Vened in 
the pushing and shoving 
contest at 12:20 pm when the 
"potential for violence" 
reached the point for 
Lieutenant Lloyd Turner to 
"pull the plug and shut it 
down," said Campus Police 
Chief Hugh French. 

Earlier that morninspolice 
had been asked to momter the 
rally by AS advisor Randy 
Woodard, who said he had a 
"gut feeling that students 
would be reacting. 

According to CARP 
director Don Marsolek, the 
"leftists" were obstructing 
their ability to speak both by 
marching in front of their 

band called the "Prime 
Force," and by their I ... ~est 
banner which read, ,. ;SR 
and Cuba out ofEI Salva, Jr." 

Marsolek said the police 
asked both the groups to 
dissemble and warneU the 
"communists" that they 
could be arrest ed for 
attempting to disrujJt the 
peace_ 

But according to AS Vice 
President Warren Wheeler 
who participated with ' the 
protesters, the students 
agreed with police orders to 
back down from the s teps 
only after the police agreed to 
also dismis s CARP's 
"propaganda campaign." 

" It was an incredibly 
sucess ful, s pontaneous 
action on the part of students

propangandizing technique 
of the Moonies, " he said, 
adding that the s tudents, by 
showing up for the second 
rally , reaffirmed that 
rejection. 

In fact, nearly 100 tudents 
showed up for Friday 's rally 
in front of the Third College 
Center for the people. 

But additional se!;urity 
measures were taken to 
ensure the safety of both 
CARP and student protesters '. 
as well as passersby who 
didn't want to get involved, 
said Third Dean Beverly 
Varga. 

Earlier that morning, 
Varga had met with campus 
police, Randy Woodard and 
representatives from both 
CARP and the group of 
students, to discu s t he 

security- measures. 
The added precautions 

included changing the 
location of the rally toan area 
with incresed accessiblility, 
and calling more police 
officers to monitor the 
demonstration. 

But the group of students 
also showed up with more 
props. placards and mega-
phones to refute the 
proclamations of CARP. 

When, for example, a 
CARP speaker announced, 
"if we lose EI Salvador we 
will also lose the rest of Latin 
America to the bloody 
communists," the students 
resounded "bullshit." 

The speaker also told the 
students that she was 
enjoying their loud reactions, 
and that CARP was simply

"raising money to buy you 
one-way tickets to visit the

addition to such whimsical 
rhetoric, CARP expressed a 
willingness to seriously 
debate with the students. 
However, no such program 
was arra~ed. 

"To debate with them 
would have I~timized what 
they were domg," said AS 
presidential candidate Jon 
Bekken, who particip'ated -
with the protesting stude!"ts. 

"They were being violent

said in reference to the first

Bill to make harsher 
harassment laws 

Assemblyman Mel Levine, 
D·Los Angeles, announced 
the introduction Thursday of 
legislation which would 
significantly strengthen 
California law protecting 
women from sexual harass· 
ment. 

Levine's bill is not 
specifica lIy directed to 
harassment in the work-
place, but is instead designed 
to strengthen California laws 
which protect women from 
unwanted advances from 
unwanted suitors. 

"The problem is a very 
serious one, but one which is 
currently treated in a much 

too cavalier manner by 
California law. My legisla-
tion, would authorize the 
incarceration of someone 
found guilty of repeatedly 
violating restraining orders 

a~ainst such harassment 
eIther in a secure mental 
institution or some other 
similar facility . 

"The danger faced by 
women who have pleaded for 
some significant protection 
from these types of people 
was vivdly brought home by 
John Hinkley, who apparent· 
Iy attempted to murder 
Reagan in an attempt to 
impress Jodie Foster . .. -

Vaseline and lubrication 

When my boyfriend uses a c. ,ldom, I 
don't lubricate. Would \ "se line 
(petroleum jelly) be a good lubricant? 

No. Never lubricate a condom (or a 
diaphragm) with petroleum jelly. If causes 
rubber, the base product of t.JLh, to 
deteriorate. K·Y jelly and saliva :-re both 
excellent lubricants . Vaseline is also t'-rderto 
clean. 
Encare Ovals 

Is the Encare Oval effective? 
An "Encare Oval" is a vaginal suppository. 

Monday , April 20, 1981 

It i a smooth white vaginal contracept ive that 
melts at body temperature. The Food and 
Drug Admini tration says the Encare Oval i 
no more effective than regular contraceptive 
foam, i.e., only 50 Lo 60 percent effective. For 
this reason, the male should always use a 
condom when t he female is using Encare Oval 
suppositories. When used with a condom, the 
Encare Oval is as effective as the pill. i.e., 99 
percent effective. 
Pregnancy during menstruation 

My girlfriend and I make love during 
her period. I just heard she can get 
pregnant. Is that so? 

Although uncommon, a woman can ovulate 
during her period and pregnancy can occur. 
Women can then become pregnant during 
menstruation . because sperm can live up to 72 
hours inside the body.

Week for 
victims 

This week has been 
designated as California 's 
fifth annual " Forgotten 
Victims Week" to focus 
pU,blic attention on the plight 
and rights of crime victims 
and the need to . restore 
fairness and effectiveness to 
the administration of 
criminal justice. 

SO Assembly Democrat 
Larry Kapiloff will introdu<1i 
a bill this month to protect 
victims by requiring that law ' 
enforcement officers keep 
secret their names unless 
they give permission for it to 
be placed in the public 
domain. 

From UCSD News 
, Researchers · at the. Med School are 

investigating a Swedish technique for 
t ran s planting "perichrondrium ", the 
connect ive tissue around carti lage, to repair 
arthritic joint damage. 

With a three-year grant from th National 
rn titutes of Health, the inve t igators will 
fir t determine whether the cultivated 
material, grown from the ti ue lining of rib 
carrilage, i a suitable 'ubstitute for joint 
cartilage and then develop the mean. for 
tran 'planting it in young patient with evere 
joint damage. 

Although rib perichrondrium is already 
being transplanted to repair finger joints, the 
UCSD researchers will iQvestigate the 
potential for repairing other major joint in 
body and then tailor transplantation 
techniques. 

Carti lage isa s lippery substance which has 
no blood su pply or nerve endings. These 
unique properties allow effortless joint 
mobility. When cartilage is injured. however. 
it is unable to repair itself since a continous 
blood supply is necessary for new cell growth. 

Earlier studies have located two sources of 
perichrondrium, within the body: rib and ear 
cartilage. The , extreme elasticity of ear 
cartilage, howEWer, makes it an unsuitable 
substitute for joint cartilage. 

"I think that' the key to our work is in 
providing a biological answer to a disease 

'process, which ha$ particular meaning for the 
youn~r patient, " Richard Coutts, M.D. , 
prinClpal investigator for the study' said. 

"In older patients, the use of artJficaljoints 
has worked well in alleviating the p,roblems of 
joint damage ," Co~s.explained . • But for the 

young patient this has not been a good 
solution, si nce artifical joints do not have an 
infinite li fe ." 

Coutts explained that if the rib cartilage i 
useable, the reseachers will determine how to 
re urface the af ted joint area and attach 
new cartilage. aid that young patients 
could then be activ without having to worry 
about joint longevity . 

Cout t explained. however , that this 
reseach is s t ill inve tigational and ma y not be 
ready fur patient treatment for sometim e.

picture 10 to prove your identity. 

ISSUE 

This special issue of the AS Bulletin is an election 
supplement, designed to give candidates a chance to 
communicate their views (and faces) to you, the voting 
public at UCSD. Some candidates wrote their statements 
and had their pictures taken, others did only one or the 
other (for whatever reason). Some did neither; they are not 
mentioned in this publication. We at the A.S. hope that you 
will find this information useful in deciding how to vote in 
the upcoming election; we also hope that you will 
remember to get out and vote, this April 22 and 23, for the 
candidates of your choice. 

Reminder: before you 
vote, be sure to read the 
voting instructions included 
with each ballot.

Joshua Harris 
Running for President 

The Guardian , 

Having served as the Commissioner of Programming during this past year , I 
have begun to build a foundation for a mor liveable UCSD. Although I feel that 
education is the number one prioriry, I believe that the college experie~ce 
should consist of more than acno':ll!i s. 

I, ran for office last year because I felt that I could hpgin to fill a void in the 
UCSD experience. I organized a programming commission (currently 
membership forty·five persons) that has an e.xcellent reputation both on 
campus and within the community. The Programming Board ran all activities 
(i .e. T.G,l.F.'s, Spirit Night , Noon Concerts, Broomball Hockey Tourriament, 
etc.) in a well·organized and professional manner. 

If elected,l will carry out the following programs and ones similar to these. I 
will increase the AS. Programming Commissions budget, and begin to fund 
and heavily promote the Sports Activities Board. I also intend to work toward 
building an amphitheatre and a facility in the Student Center that can 
accomodate large groups of people. I will work to make the A.S, institution a 
respected one, for wit hout the support of the students, administrat ion and 
community the AS, is essentially a powerless body. It is important that we elect 
people that can work effectively with these groups. 

UCSD is a young school (ten years old) and we are feeling the growing pains 
(i .e . lack of facilities, retention, and a lilX governing body). The most that any 
student government can hope to accomplish in one year is to build the 
foundations for the solutions to these problems. 

Just as our slogan states, we are just st~dents who enjoy serving people. 
When you vote for us, we feel that you are truly voting for yourself. 

Mark Massara 
Running for President 

1."h.e. sch<?Ol year 1981·82 promises to be a very busy one at UCSD. Many 
activIties Will take place. Some will be beneficial to students. But other events 
are potentially harmful to the students of UCSD, My goal is to rally students 
together, and to get students to fight for their rights and interests, both at 
school and in the state of California. 

During the course of the last year the Associated Student Government at 
UCSD has spent much time and effort fighting the bureaucracy and not 
enough time pursueing concrete goals. As President, my major concern would 
be helping the A.S, establish a small number of specific attainable goals and 
directing their efforts toward reaching those goals. ' 

There are many specific goals that are within reach of an organized student 
govemment. I would like to see the AS. incorporate and eventually buy the 

cam~us bookstore. UCSD is also in need of more free programming, including 
IllOVIeS, lectures, and ~.G.I . F.'s . The campus radio station (KSDT), as well as 
the co·ops and enterprises, all need more AS. support, As President , l would 
also fight for a solution to the terrible parking problem on campus. 
. In short, if elected President,I will fight for you, the student, and protect your 
Interests. I encourage your support and suggestions, Thank you, and 
remember, VOTE INDEPENDENT, VOTE MASSARA!! 

Mitch Sosna 
Running for President 

Why do you want to read this statement? If you want answers to acne sexual 
dysfunction, or morning breath then ask one of the other Pres'idential 
candidates, but if you want ACTION taken on relevant student concerns then 
read on . ' 

My name is Mitch Sosna and I'm running for President on the Action : not 
React ion slate. We plan on taking action next year on programs and issues, 
instead of having to react to problems in retrospect. 

Through my work, with student organizations over the past two years, and 
through my being a UC Lobby Annex Co· Director and Third College 
Representative on the AS. CouncilI've gained valuable experience in working 
with students, faculty and administration . What I've done in the p'ast is 
important , but what I'm going to do next year is more important. , . 

There is a definite necessity for the AS. to be more responsive to the .needs 
of students on campus. An effective government next year will work to solve 
the ~roblems of: an increasing number of rapes this year on campus, the lack of 
ethmc students and faculty, the almost nonexistent social life at ucsb. 

I realize that although these goals might possibly seem too ambitious we . 
believe that these and others can be accomplished through greater contact 
between the A.S. and the student body. We are committed to attaining student 
involvement and input. We feel that we can have an effective student voice on 
campus, and responsive student services while still having fun at the same time. 

For an effective student government" next year, one that you can 
communicate and work with, ·then vote Action: not reaction. . 

Jules Bagneris 
Running for President 

I intend to bring leadership and respect to the ASUCSD. The job of the 
president requires a knowledge of the political arena and the ability to use it in 
the student interest. It is long overdue for the type of leadership and direction 
that is necessary to insure that vital campus issues are not neglected but 
respected. My political eKperience is extensive. I have served on numerous 
campus wide committees as well as participating on the college and AS. 
councils and the Activity Fee, Judicial, and Student Center Boards . This 
experience will enable the successful implementation of your most needed 
concerns. I am willing and capable to work for you . 

The issues of major concern are the issues that affect us most. Campus 
concerns like the cost of housing and books , student input into the tenure 
process, the development of fair educational policy, programming, and AS. 
services that meet the needs of todays students, These things and many more 
are just a taste of the sweet juices that strong leadership in the AS. can extract. 
Leadership that is dedicated to bring Respect With Perspective to the UCSD 
campus. We reflect your wishes in this effort.

Thl (;"arditll1 

Jon. Bekken Last year, only 18.5"0 of UCSD's budget went to instruction· related expenses. This is indiCative of priorities at this University. Student needs are 
not being met - by the administration or by the ASUCSD. I, and the Immoral 
Minority slate, am running to change that. 

Running for Pre~ident . 

The UC administrarion is seriously considering implementing tuition. 
Budget cutbacks are in the wings. E)(cellent teachers are being fired as a result 
of the tenure process. And about half of the students who enter UCSD will 
never graduate from here, These are real problems - problems which affect all 
students. Only aggressive student advocilcy, combined with mobilization of 
student support, can effectively defend our interest. On a day to day level, the 
bureaucracy shows its contempt for students - in Parking, in Res Halls , in 
Cafeterias. 

To confront these issues we need a fighting AS. - and an AS. which works 
to meet student needs. We need to ensure that at least 2/ 3 of Activity Fees go 
to organizations (which do the bulk of campus programming) and media. We 
need to restructure the A.S. in order to make it more effective. And we need to 
pursue aggressive student representation at all levels. 

This takes people who are e)(perienced and committed. While at UCSD I 
have been active in student organizations, campus programming, and student 
media . I have served as A.S , Commissioner of Student Welfare and Public 
Relations Director, and am currently on the Student Center Board. The other 
members .of the Immoral Mi nority Slate are similarly committed. 

Vote for someOlle with the ability to e ffectively represent students, and the 
determination to do so, Vote for me, Jon Bekken, for President. Working 
together, along wit h the other members of the Immoral Minority slate, we can 
make a difference , ' .. 

Erik Singer 
Running for Vice President 

A well qualified Vice Presidential candidate must possess the skills to work 
efficiently with a wide range of people as well as to meet the challenge of the 
office. 

As current Student Lobby Annex Director and participant in several 
leadership programs, I developed these necessary skills. Through attendance 
at statewide conferences I have gained valuable experience in dealing with 
representatives from across the state, while successfully meeting the 
challenges of statewide problems regarding nuclear prevention, housing , and 
tuition reinstitution , 

I have actively observed AS. Student Council meetings and have met many 
times with the current Vice President. Consequently I am well aware of the 
duties and responsibil ities of an effective and competent Vice President. 

Equally important to an understanding of the position of Vice President is a 
working relationship with the council. Election of the Student Slate, of which I 
am the Vice Presidential candidate, will help ensure an harmonious 
environment for an effective student government. 

Irene Flores

AIDla Key 

"The bird that would soar above the level plane of tradition and prejudice 
must have strong wings." - Kate Chapin 

My name is Irene Flores. I'm running for the office of Vice President of the 
A.S. I'd like to take a few minutes of your time to read and learn why you should 
vote for me , I'm very qualified for the position. I have been Chair of the Third 
College Ctluncil , a Third Colle~e Resident Adviser, and have worked on 
campus wide issues. 

I'm running on the Action: not Reaction. slate . We are going to take 
ACTION not sit and wait to react to issues . 

You' re probably wondering where I stand on some of the relevant issues that 
concern you. 

It's time the AS. started working more cohesively within itself and with the 
students at large , It's time to bring a sense of community to the AS. This can be 
achieved through people like myself, who want to work with other students, 
faculty and administration by bringing more student involvement to important 
decision making within the university . The A.S. can be and will be more open 
and available, just by not having representatives who represent their own 
special interests like there have been in the past. The AS, must respond to the 
need for addition'al programming that can be enjoyed by all students. We need 
to see more services and programs coordinated between the A,S . and colleges. 
When I speak of services and programs I'm referring to better Affirmative 
Action, Rape prevention and awareness, activities for those not only over 21 
but under, etc. 

Obviously not all the important issues can be discussed in the space allottee: , 
But issues such as low cost housing and maintainence of the college system are 
also of high priQrities , So, for strong effective leadership next year vote 
ACTION: not reaction. 

Running for Wce President 
I intend to bring structure and respect to ASUCSD. It is shameful to 

acknowledge how the A,S . has so pitifully existed in recent years. A.S . 
meetings have been repeated hours of confusion that mad it difficult to make 
quality decisions , As Vice·President I will conduct ~uslness mee~ lngs preCisely 
and the council will make decisions only after intellrgent drscusslng Issues that 
we are confronted with. The ridiculous actions traditionally associated with 
AS. meetings will cease. The time has come for AS. to become a serious force 
for students at UCSD. 

My experien!e in developing structure and r~nning meetings in 
organizations is extensive. I will use the knowledge and expenence that I have 
gained to develop A.S. into a respected group. A.S, already has the resources 
to be respected as well as powerful- It now needs the I adership to become 
such. In fulfilling by obligations as Vice Pres ident, I will provide that leadership. 
Respect for A,S . is long overdue at UCSD , A vote for Respect With Perspective 
is a vote for the most respected and influential A,S, this campus has ever seen.

To'dd ThoDlpSOn 
Running for Vice President 

Students, not bureaucrats! Our slate - the Immoral Minority - believes 
this university should focus on the needs of the STUDENTS, for a change. For 
too long, administration and research have been the top priorities at UCSD. As 
a result , undergraduate education has deteriorated and, increasingly, student 
int rests are being ignored. 

The A.S. Council must stop bickering over issues like " How many T.G.I .F.'s 
should we have?".and, instead, should pressure administrators Iu del ill tl.e 
student interest. 

Students are tired of pulling up with a campus police force which is too busy 
writing parking tickets to do anything about the rape epidemic. We are tired of 
fighting for a parking space on the fringe of campus while "B" permit lots lie 
empty. And - most of all - we are tired of administrators who view 
undergraduate education as mere window-dressing. It's time to do away with 
the caste system here at UCSD. Students must no longer be treated as an 
"Immoral Minority." 

My experience as Activity Fee Commissione r has taught me how to deal 
with the bureaucracy, as Vice President, my budgetary experience would be 
put to good use. As the only "Silly Student" who did no/ resign, I can assure you 
I won't bail-out when the going gets tough . 

Last year, a "Silly" vote sent the message that students were fed up with 
"politics as usual." This year, a vote for the Immoral Minority will also send a ========= 
message - that we students are tired of being ignored by administrator.s. 

Last year the A.S _ was in charge of disbursing $151 ,000 of the student.'s 
money. It managed to complete this task, though the manner in which this was 
accomplished seemed more like madness then method. 

The Council decided the Committee for World Democracy deserved 
$13,504 to show free political films, while Joe's Escort Service deemed only 
$517.95 to prOllide safe walking on campus. As a member of Joe's Escort 
Service, I am fully aware that the safety conditions on this campus are appalling 
and certainly deserve a more serious, and fiscally responsible reply from the 
A.S. 

This year, the new indicator found a way to spend over $12.000, almost 3 
times more than any other campus newspaper, while the A.S . Programming 
Commission had to make due with $14,540. A.S. Programming, which 
sponsors the T.G.I.F .'s, campus dances, noon concerts, Olympics and more, 
certainly deserves a substantially greater budget than the new indicator, which 
appears to me to be nothing more then a CIA plot to make the left-wing look 
bad. 

The Intramural program (3000 participants), Intercollegiate Athletics (964), 
and the Rec Clubs (over 1500) are perhaps the most nagrant examples of large 
numbers of students receiving disproportionately small budgets. These 
programs constitute a large portion of the student population and absolutely 
require the A.S. council's full support and respect if financial support is n'ot 
possible . 

While not condemning the smaller, less popular programs to complete 
annihilation, as a Rational Party Member, I think it's time the A.S. Council 
started determining student's wishes by their support of certain programs (1M, 
TGIF; Rec Clubs, Athletics). The A.S. budget should renect these student 
interests and put its money where its people are.

Running for Vice President 

Th,: Associ.ated Students Council Vice-President must firmly, consistently

OpIniOnS, values and goals of others, 3)use my leadership experience to aid my

I' intend. doing ev~rything in my power to facilitate an efficient far reaching 
and effeclrve ASSOCIated Students Council. 

I am hoping to be re-ele t d as Commissioner of Student Welfare. 
During the last year as Commissioner of Student W elfare I have acted, along 

with other student advocates, as liaison in handling students' grievances 
against a professor or an administrator through the Student Advocate 
Program. The Student Advocate Program is a student·run program designed 
to protect, ensure and educate students of their rights within the University 
experience and community. The hope surrounding the Student Advocate 
Program is that students informed of their rights will be encouraged to exercise 
them. Through exercise, rights are given life. If they are rarely used they may be 
forgotten and violations may become routine. My hope is to strengthen the 
Student Advocate Program by recruiting more students to act as Student 
Advocates. Only determined, well-organized students can radically change 
things to their advantage and address such issues as sexism, racism, 
harassment by police, and academic and administrative grievances that prevail 
in this institution. 

In addition to coordinating the Student Advocate Program, I have been 
active in A.S. Council activities, and am currently serving on the Task Force on 
University Procedures Regarding Demonstrations. I have been vocal in 
continually striving towards democratization of the A.S . and advocating 
structural changes to allow greater student participation in the formulation of 
policy and offer their input to student governance. Greater inclusion of 
students in their governance may perhaps serve to leave the role of students 
less in question, in relation to the A.S.

Running for Commissioner of External Affairs 

As one of the few representatives who was elected to the A.S . Council thiS 
year and did not resign , I feel that I have the' exp rience and patience to 
competently fill the position of Commissioner of External Affairs. While serving 
on Council as Muir A.S. Rep, I have worked on a number of educational 
functions and am presently working on a few as well . It is absolutely imperat ive 
to work on new projects rather than be destructive toward those that already 
exist. As a member of the Action: not Reaction slate , I intend to continue 
working on issues that are important to students, such as those concerning 
tuition and housing. All of us will work to educate the student body about 
various issues, as well as to serve as responsible representatives of students on 
committees and throughout the'UC systt!m. Our main priority, though , is to 
get students in on the action, and not just perpetuate the autonomous body 
that the A.S. has been for too long. 

~enry ehu 
Running for Commissioner of Academic Affairs 

The student's voice has long been disregarded as an unqualified and 
u~,:xperienced opi~ion on educational policies. Generally, the student's 
Criticism on the quahty of academic education has not been taken seriously. As 

Com~~ssloner of A cademic Affairs I will be beyond the role of merely "being 
heard, but Insunng that the necessary refinements for a stronger education 
are actually carried out to its entirety. For the most part, students expect to 
learn and acquire a fine education from UCSD. Therefore, education must 
revolve under constant refinements and new techniques for maximum 
Improvement. Furthermore, students must be constantly informed of current 
academic rights and policies, so that they may be used to their full advantage 
Instead of. a physl~al block. I emphasize the importance of successfully using 
constructrve cntlclsm by students on academic issues, because this is an area 
where we can gain respect of the administration. In this way not only can 
successes in academic affairs be reached, but also in non-academic ac tivities . 
This would be an opportunity to demonstrate the potential of students and 
their g?vernment in improving an institution. From this reasoning, as elected 
commISSioner of Acade~ic Affairs ~ I would work closely with students for a 
change, and tactfully fulfill the deSires of the student needs in UCSD. 

Lee Anderson

Among the vast mel1Llgene of In t rnLlII).· fCl(used A.S. pOSitions exists the 
anomolly of the A .Idem. Affairs Commiss.tlner whose legitimacy to both the 
council and the administration must continually be reaffirmed. This is 
unfortunate due to the stellar importance assigned to academics by virtually 
every member of the UCSD community. This paradoxical impotence must be 
fully understood by those seeking this post; a weak or unconcerned 
commissioner can affect considerable harm by conveying an image of student 
apathy or disunity to the administration in general and the Academic Senate in 
particular . To facilitate an informed choice, l brieny outline my orientations and 
the issues I intend to work for. • 

Affirmative Action: weak at UCSD and must be strengthened and applied to 
recruitme·nt. Women's Studies: department or program must be established to 
deal with societal sexism. Other Programs: departmental status and increased

community. Vice-Chancellor for Uhdergraduate Affairs : must have open lines

T ricia Russo 
Running for Commissioner of Communications 

As most people don't know, there are eight publications on campus that are 
funded by your activity fees . By being well Jnformed on the needs of each of 
these publications, I will be able to distribute funds quitahly to them. I would 
also encourage anyone with ideas on perspective newspapers or journals to 
contact me, and if possible seek funding . 

Being a Communications major , I am aware of the power of the media and 
how it could be used to best serve UCSD. That is why I fully support the 
expansion of KSDT, the campus radio station . ThiS media could be used to 
inform the students of campus activities, while serving their music needs . 
KSDT has the potertia! to be one of our most valuable resources, but past 
student governments have failed to realize this potent ial. 

Having served on the Communications Board, I now feel very qualified for 
the position of Commissioner of Communications. I am familiar with the 
structure and workings of ASUCSD government. If the governing body has 
specific goals, it is possible to muddle through the bureaucratic structure to 
meet those goals. I support improving t he quality of student activities. And I am 
also in favor of expanding the co-ops and other student enterprises. Student 
involvement is essential to any quality university. These organizations allow 
you to gl!t involved while improving campus life for all. So get involved and

Dave T ollner 
Running for Activity Fee Chairman 

As a member of the athletic program, the intramural program and above all, 
a student at UCSD, I have become painfully aware over the years of the 
injustices done to the whole of the student body. When such organizations as 
Rec Clubs whom service thousands of students annually are monetarily cut 
back to the brink of extinction while other programs that service mere dozens 
are allowed to flourish, there is certainly unparallelled inequity. 

I have an advantage here in that I am by no means a politician. I refuse to be 
clouded by the politics of the A.S. I am simply a student interested in curing a 
hopefully benign illness here at UCSD. If this can somehow be accomplished 
without my being elected, then far the better; I would have saved a bit of time 
dud d gtave probl m would be solved. 

Barring this outcome, however, I am intent on working in correlation with my 
slate members, Matt Adams and Tom Doupe, whom share my beliefs. 
Together we will work hard to accomplish some assemblance of order in this 
backward system. With a little luck and a lot of determination we can yet "right 
the unrightable wrong." 

Wade Bickel Running for Activity Fee Chairman 
I believe that Student Organization; enhance both the academic and non· 

academic atmosphere of UCSD. Student organizations are an effective means 
of making both educational and recreational activities available to students. In 
the past year I served on both the AS. Programming Commission and the 
Sports Activities Board, and worked with various members of the A.S. on a 
number of projects. 

A~ a member ~f the Sp~rts'Activi.ties Board, I am aware of the great amount 
of Interest In intercollegiate and intramural sports. As Activity Fee 
Chairperson, and as an AS. Council member, I will work to bring about growth 
in both the Intercollegiate and Recreation (intramural) departments. I will work 
to see an increase in AS. support for Rec·Clubs, which bring enjoyable 
recreational opportunities to UCSD students. 

The duty of the Activity Fee Board is to allocate funds to student 
organizations. I have worked with this year's Activity Fee Chairman on the final 
'80-'81 budget, and I feel that this has given me a much needed insight into the 
responsibilities of the Activity Fee Chairperson. [t is my intention to make sure 
that the Activity Fee Budget is allocated efficiently and fairly in the '81-'82 
school year and that student interests, not special interests are served. 

The goal of the Student Slate is to run the student government for the benefit 
'Of the general student populus. I and the other members of the Student Slate 
will strive to accomplish this and set the foundations of a more effective A.S. in 
the years to come.

However, the Commissioner also represents the interests of all students and 
their organizations on the A.S. Council. 

[f elected, [ will advocate and support an equitable distribution of funds 
between programming, organizations and student media. Furthermore, as a 
member of the A.S. Council I will work to bring about needed changes in the 
University bureaucracy. Students need a more effective A.S. - one which can 
address issues such as parking, tuition, budget cuts, academic policy, tenure 
practices and retention . We ne~d to re·orientthis University, so that it serves 
Students, not bureaucrats. 

Vote for me, Mark Seecof, for Commissioner of Communications. With the 
other members of the Immoral Minori:y slate , we can make a change in this 
university. 

Wendell Leonard 
Running for Commissioner of Appointments and Evaluations 

[n properly and effectively performing the duties of the Appointments and 
Evaluation Commissioner, I will assure that two basic ~tions are carried out in 
all that is done. First, individuals who show qualifiquioTl6 for positions on the 
various committees will be appointed in all fairness . Second, Evaluations will be 

condu~ted objectivel.y , with student input playing a major role in t he process. [ 
feel It IS extremely Important that I work closely with , the Public Relations 

Com~issioner in .act ively inf?rming students of the available opportunities to 
participate on vanous committees. Students must be enthusiastically informed 
if tlLey are to actively 'participate in the evaluation process. 

As a result of my active participation in the Revelle Third World Alliance and 
other activities, [ have seen many of the problems students are faced ~th. 
These problems can be addressed through various committees on which 
students can participate and effect changes. Appointments and Evaluations 

C0n:tmi~sioner is a ~e'Y important position. [n holding this position, [ will 
qualitalively and objectively do the best job possible. Vote Respect With 
Perspective.

Running for Commissioner of Elections 
Hello, my name is Denise Long. I am running for Commissioner of Elections . 

[ became interested in student government at my High School. Since High 
School, I have been an acltve member of many campus organizations. I realize 
the I~portance that good leadership makes in the proper functioning of 
organizations. Although my job as the Commissioner of Elections is a limited 
one, my past experien~e will help extend my existing functions . [ will cast my 
vote In support of key Issues such as: l)More student input into the Professor 

Te~~re Process. 2)Fully fu.nding and sl!pporting the Daycare Center. 3)The 
bUilding of a new Englneenng School, which students will have a voice in the 
organization, selection of professors, and assessing the additional costs to 
students. 

I a~ curre~tly a jun.ior at Muir. My past experience includes working as a 
HOUSing ~dvisor, Orientation Lea.der , Residence Hall V.P., and keeping 
Involved With MUIr College. If I receive the position of A.S. Rep for Muir, I will 
dependably represe~t MUir College at all A.S . meetings that would req.uire my

make the nght chOtce and vote for me at the polls on April 22 and 23. Vote 
Denise Long on the Respect With Perspective Slate. 

Craig . Kreeger 
Runntng for Commissioner of Public Relations 

A major ~ampaign issue this year deals with the fact that there is no clear 
underst.andlng ~mong students as to the function of the A.S. As Commissioner 
of Public Relaltons, one of my duties would be to insure that students are 

con~tantly aw.a~e of e:<actly h?w AS: actions affect them. One way of doing 
t hiS IS b¥ prOViding an informative and Interesting A.S. Bulletin. As a past editor 
of my high s~~ool newspaper, .and former paid sportswriter for a local paper, [ 
am well quahhed to handle thiS part of the Public Relations job. 

T~e. req~irements of this position extend to the working within the 
admlnlstrallon and community to promote both the A.S., and UCSD as a 
whole. I ve gain~~ experience in working within the administrative system 
through my parllClpatlo!,! on the AS. Communications Board (budgeting A.S . 
funds . to campus ~edl?), and on t~e A.S. Programming Board (helping 
coord.lnate T .G.I.F. s). [ve also acqUired . a knowledge of the organizational 
techmques I ~II need thr.ough my chairmanship of the Sports Activities Board. 
In that capac.lt~. [ .0r9:l'ntzed both Spirit Nights. [ believe that the success of 
those even.ts I~ mdicahve. of the importance of sports on this campus, and that 
by prOm?hng Intercolleglates, the SAB can become a visible AS. force in the 
commu.olty. ~ 0 further this A:S. ~isibil~ty in the community, I plan to organize 
more direct hnes of commu,lJlCalton With San Diego media. 

Thus, by keeping !he students informed, [ plan to represent the aim of the 
Student Slate. That 15, to form a govemment that represents the interests of 
the students.

Ken Cluff 
Running for Revelle College Representative 

The most important job of a Revelle representative is to be just that a 
represe.ntative of the students of Revelle College to the governing bodies of this 
university. I feel that I have performed this duty to the students during my few 
months as an appOinted . Revelle Rep. and would like to continue doing so as 
your elected representative. My experience includes not only my position on 
the cur:re!"t A.S . but also a year of active service on the AS. Programming 
Com~lsslon and work on the Revelle Judicial Committee. With this 
expenence, an~ your support, I look forward to effectively representing 
Revelle College In the year to come. 

-a •• 
.- . 

. Ever since [ transferred to this university two years ago I've felt that there 
was something missing! ' 

UCSD has a great academic program, the most beautiful campus I've ever 
seen, and it is located in the most desirable city in the United States. With 
everything going for UCSD, what could go wrong? .. Everything!!! 

For instance, there is no unity within the University, the campuses are 
separate?, the. dif~erent maj~rs feel that the others are insignificant, and the 
competition wlth' ln each major program seems to prevail over all else . I am 
willing to take drastic measures to overcome these barrier . Working tog ther 
and combining our Id as we can do it. I declare unity!

As the only candidate with previous A.S . experience , ) feel I have gained th 

knowledge necessary to serve effectively as Commissioner of Public Relat ions. 
During my term as Muir College representat ive I have been active in programs 
designed to inform students of business in the Associated Students Council, a 
necessary duty of the Commissioner of Public Relations. Through increased 
awareness among the student body, it is possible to create an atmosphere 
conducive to action in student related' issues. Th~ ALl ion: not Reaction slilte is 
committed toward this improved communication, as well as addressing vital 
issues, such as institution of tuition and increased off·campus housing. I will 
attempt to improve relations through the institution of open forums and a 
comprehensive A.S. Bulletin - alternatives previously considered, but not 
fully utilized in the past.

Running for Commissioner of Appointments and Evaluations 
In today's society, the word government , whether A.S. or Federal, carries 

along with it connotations of control, and control is generally regarded as 
inheritantly aversive. I would like to work in bringing the students the 
knowledge that the A.S. is not an organization set up to control the students, 
but an organization established to fr ee the students from the excessive 
controls the system exerts on them, and to give the students an opportunity to 
counter·control that system. 

Mitch ThoDlpson 
Running for Commissioner of Elections 

I'm running on the Immoral Minority slate - ucsO's Gang of Four. We 
believe that UCSD exists for the benefit of students, not bureaucrat . Too 
often it is the bureaucrats and administrators' interests which take precedence 
over those of students'. A classic example of this is the recent re·routingof bus 
lines on campus, simply because the noise was disturbing campus staff. This 
move was made regardless of any inconvenience it might cause students. Our 
slate feels that arbitrary actions like these must stop. The main role of student 
government should be to insure that administrators don't trample on students. 

As Commissioner of Electionli. I feel that I wouid be a strong voice for 
student concerns on the AS Council. I also propose establishing the practice of 
ostracism at UCSD. The ancient Athenians would vote each year to determine 
if a dangerous or despicable person should be exiled. Here at UCSD, students 
could submit names of the most imcompetent, lazy'or rude bureaucrats, and 
the one with the most votes would be exiled from UCSD. This might remind 
the staff that they are here to serve students. The threat of a Holiday in 
Cambodia might not be a bad idea. 

AdaDl Forest 
Running for Commissioner of Programming 

The Programming Commission is primarily responsible for events which are 
(ree to the students, i.e. T .G .I.F.'s, campus·wide broomball tournaments, 
extra funding for spirit night dances, (ree noon concerts, etc. I have served on 
the University Events, Pop Events committee (or three years. Last year I was 
Co.Chairman of the committee when we presented the Pretenders and 
Southside Johnny concerts on campus. My extensive experience with the 
ent ertamment mdustry will be instrumental in improving the quality o( 
T.G .LF .'s, bringing bett er bands to campus, and improving the quality of the 
rest of our programming. A prime target of this yea rs programming 
commission was to put on more and bet ter events . I will definit ely maintain and 
increase this trend.

thing about this i t hat until 
the movie decides to visit San

an aooorbiniJ, tense tour de

vitality of that hustling city 
on the make. The arne sen e

and big bucks. Hi income 
from a bar and car lot he 
owns i supplemented by the 
periodic jewel heists he pulls 
off. Caan has one of his best 
roles since The Rain People 
though he occasionally lapses 
into po t-Brando manner-

inarticulatene s, 

Tuesday Weld is wasted in 
a thankless role as Caan 's 
wife. and Jim Belus hi as 
Caan's as i t ant eem like 
he' doing impre s ion of his 
brother John . But Willie 
Nel on brings a lifet ime of 
pain to his cameo as Caan's 
mentor that i not hing hort

Poets at UCSD 
Recital Hall sho\V 

Two good poet ry 
readings are happening at 
UCSD this week. The 
UCSD New Poetry Series 
will begin its Spring 
quarter series with David 
Bromige, reading from 
his work Wednesday , 
April 29, 4 pm in the 
Revelle Formal Lounge. A 
teacher at Sonoma State 
CorIege, his-work could be 
termed the poetry of 

the Che Cafe will sponsor 
an open poetry reading at 8 
pm. Anyone who wishes to 
read their work is welcome 
to join in. On Thursday, 
April 30, poets Charlie 
Heimler and Steve 
Kowit will read their 
works, also at 8 pm. 
Heimler is the editor of 
Burnt Siena magazine, a 
literature grad student at 
UCSD and a teacher at 

Poet David Bromiae 

What makes The Herpes 
different from any other 
aspiring band? Every group 
has ambitions along with the 
confidence in its own 
abilities. They would all like 
to rub shoulders with the big 
names. So what gives these 
guys the right to think they 
can make it? Mainly because 
this is not a dead group. Not 
content to cover the 
s tandards or play tepid 
originals, The Herpes have 
managed to create an entity 
which is deri vative of rock 
archetypes, yet possessed of a 
unique per onality. They 
make no unctuous attempt to 
hide their de ire for ucce s, 
as J.Y. points out: "We're 
looking for a ocial movement 
to cash in on ." 

The main concept behind 
the band is an oldie but a 
goodie : artistic integrity 
couples with commercial 
success. They eschew the 
macho-crotcho school of rock 
and strive for a more sUbtle 
kind of sensuality in their 
quest to break down audience 
barriers. Their art is not the 
farcical stabs at seriousnes 
that band like Steely Dan 
have re orted to, but rather , 
it is a propagation of the rock 
myth - a concept The 
Herpe have down pat. 
Talking to them makes one 
feel as though they have a 
kind of unity found only in

tion. ~ectors of the labs 
have actively lobbied in 
Congress in order to promote 
further weapons develop· 
ment, including the neutron 
bomb. The purpose of the 
University is to further 
humanitarian pursuits, not 
to further the arms race. 
Thus, the University should 

discontinue management of 
the weapons labs . .

advocated complete conver-
sion of the labs from weapons 
development to peacef ul 
research in fields such as 
energy and biomedicine. The 
UC Regent s and the 
Department of Energy, 
however, have refused to 
consider such a move. So the 
SBPC and the Student Lobby 
are asking the University to

or support ofthe University's 
ties to the weapons labs.

AS constitutional convention

did not leave the convention 
aired their vies on some of the 
proposed constitutions_ 

Wheeler's constitution 
offers a bicameral system 
with representation by 
academic major as well as by 
college, a feature one 
freshman delegate lauded as 
"something students wil.1 
really be responsive to, " 

But the AS Council under 
this structure would have 
about 70 members, and 
several delegates feIt this 

would make- AS meetings 
"even more unman~eable 
than they already are. 

Several delegates found 
Williams' constitution, 
which also calls for a 
bicameral system, problem-
matic due to its voting 
stipulations - any student 
who attends two previous 
Council meetins may vote on 
all matters except budgets 
and appointments. 

Several delegates and 
many AS officials fear this 
could lead to domination of 

st udent government by 
special interest ~oups, who 
would pack meetings to sway 
votes. 

"I agree the special interest 
problem does exist," said 
Williams . "But if students 
organize and gather at- three ' 
meetings, it means they 
really care about an issue, 
and they should havea vote." 

Sabo cri ticized the "town 
hall-type meetings" that 
Williams' constitution calls 
for, as it "assumes that 
students here want to get 

involved with student 
government ." 

She and Topkis favor 
revision of the present AS 
structure rather than the 
institution of an entirely new 
form of government. 

'Any UCSD student may 
write a constitution and 
submit it for discussion at the 
April 30 convention. AS 
members have no priority 
over students at large -
every tudent has one vote.

CARP 
rally 

continued from page 7 
that no bodily harm occured 
during either demonstration , 
the first rally on the gym 
step was clearly a more 
intense confrontation than 
the second one on Friday. 

And Varga said that she 
was pleased with the 
re str aint of violence 
displayed by participants at 
Friday's rally. "I would like 
to commend the students 
who monitored the event," 
she said, "they are some of 
our finest studen ts." 

Tho e students will get 
another chance to react when 
CARP Inc. returns to UCSD 
on April 27, to sponsor a film 
and speaker presentation. 

At that presentation, said 
CARP Inc. Director Marso-
lek, they would be willing to 
formally debate the group of 
students . 

A professor observing 
Friday's rally said he felt the 
tudents would have been 

more effective if they had 
imply ignored CARP's 

invitation for protest.

Here's what accreditation team leader John Milton said about UCSD during 
his last visit: 

That hath thy craft, 
By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies. 

But what hath been thy answers, what but dark, 
Ambiguous, and with double sense deludlngl* 

But Milton also said that students can be a part of 
taking the University from those who are content 
to let it rest as a human overflow lot for Berkeley 

or a Valley vacation home. 

Write for The Guardian and expose the selfish 
and the greedy. 

And, there's room for those who want to write 
about good things peculiar to UCSD - students 
who graduate in 2 years, professors on the edge 
of discovery, and people all over the campus 
who take seriously their commitment to 

improving the quality of life and education. 

Call Jeff Beresford-Howe at The Guardian 
(452-3466), or stop by the office if you want to 
shake things up, make (a little) money, or just be 
noticed and loved by parents, friends ' and 
prospective employers. We're in the building 
with Che Cafe, amidst the eucalyptus trees 
southeast of the Revelle Provost's Office ... see you 

soon!
