I NA MEMO ADDRESSED to "all users of radioisotopes" at UCSD, Environmental Health and 
Safety Agency said that they had 
"noted several instances in 
which experiments involving 
substantial amounts of 
radioactivity have been carried 
out without adequate shielding," 

Memos such as this one 
(dated Jan. 7) are routinely sent 
out as reminders.

La Jolla re-zoning 
discussed 

The San Diego City Council 
voted last week to reconsider 
estabhshing "cultural zones" in 
La Jolla and throughout the city. 
The Planning Commission 
decided to sc uttle suc h a 
proposal la91. week which is 
designed to preserve cultural 
institutions around Prospect 
Avenue and Silverado Avenue in 
La Jolla. 

As it was proposed initially, 
the cultural zone would prevent 
olTicials of cultural Institutions . 
from selling thei r land for high-
density residential purposes. The 
issue surfaced afte r it was 
reported that the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art 
was considering moving 
downtown after a residential 
developer made a lucrative offer 
for its 2.2 acre La Jolla site. 

There will be a public hearing 
March 18 on the matter. 

Record numbers 
of aliens deported 

The Border Patrol reponed last 
week that its agents arrested a 
record number of illegal aliens in 
the San Diego area in January. 
Last month , 53 ,866 aliens were 
deported an increase of 16,459 
over the same period last year, 
according to the repon. A 
spokesman said that last month's 
arrests represent the biggest 
monthly toll for any sector in 
Border Patrol history. About 
1,000 of those arrested were 
from countries other than 
Mexico. 
Prize-winning author 
to lecture at UCSD 

Frances Fitzgerald, Pulitzer 
Prize-winning author of Fire in 
the Lake: The Vietnamese and the 
Ameriwns in Vietnam, will be a 
Regents' lecturer at UCSD the 
week of Feb. 10-14. 

Her topic, which will cover 
both lectures, will be "New 
American Social Experiments" 
and is derived from her latest 
work which examines a series of 
nontraditional human 
communities which evolved in 
th is country during the past two 
decades. 

Fire in the lAke won the 
Nationdl Book Award and the 
Bancroft PrIze from the American 
Historical Association when it 
was published in 1972. 

''The Department of History 
and d;e entire UCSD campus is 
extremely fortunate to attract Ms. 
Fitzgerald as a Regents' lecturer," 
said the department chairman, 
Michael Parrish. "S he is a scholar 
and writer of great originality 
and matchless style who pas set 
the highest standards for careful 
research and eloquent prose 
writing." 

In 1979, she wrote another 
highly acclaimed book, Ameriw 
Revisited, which examined the 
changing intellectual fashions in 
the writing of American history 
from the late 18th century to the 
present. 

Fitzgerald is scheduled to give 
public talks on Tuesday and 
Thursday at 8 pm in Peterson 
Hall . Admission is free.

that the really dangerous history

may not have the intense energy 
it may have had in the '60s, it is 
still, very definitely, moving

digression , not an ornament, not 
a piece of terrain; nor is it a

it will be okay, and we won't

Radioisotop-es, chemicals and microorganisms 

Students warned about lab hazards 
Continued from page 1 

Haza rdous conditions in 
university laboratories has 
become a major conce rn for the 
UC Student Lobby this legislative 
session, according to an article 
in the Lobby Annex Newsletter. 
Last Friday, in Sacramento, Bill 
SB1741 con crning the issue was 
introduced to the California 
legi slature by its author, ScnatOr 
Nicholas Petris, D-A1ameda. 

"The lobby is intent on 
passmg [WO proposals which will 
ameliorate the situation," said 
David Marchick, associate 
director of the Student Lobby 
Annex at UCSD. The first 
proposal under the bill "would 
rcpeal section 6386 of the labor 
code which proVides statutory 
protection for all lab employees 
while exempting students," the 
newsletter said . It would also 
make Material Safety Data Sheets 
(MSDS) available to all persons, 
including students, whereas 
under current law, this 
protection is exempted from 
many non-commercial labs, the 
newsletter said. 

The second proposal would 
create the position of an 
Environmental Health and Safety 
Ombudsman on each UC 
campus, who would provide 
safety information for students 
and encourages students [0 
repon hazardous conditions on a 
confidential basis, the newsletter 
said. 

area. We had no other option ," 
Knutsen sa id . 

The lobby feels students and 
graduate students working as 
teaching assistants are fearful of 
reponing such dangerous 
conditions directly to professors 
and/ or employers because their 
grades and/ or salaries might be 
jeopardized, Marchick said. 

The situation is similar to that 
of social science students in 
lectures, Knutsen said, where 
students are afraid to publically 
admit "Professor X is a crummy 
lecturer," for fear of retribution 
later if they have to take future 
classes with that same professor. 

Alfred N. Rea, director of 
Environmental Health and Safety 
at UCSD, could recall no specific 
accidents or reponed hazards by 
students at UCSD or any other 
UC campus. His olTice monitors 
all types of hazards at the 
medical sc hool, Scripps Hospital 
and the campus in general. A 
press conference at the state 
capital today, however, is 
expected to expose a "litany of 
horror stories," Knutsen said . 
Among other speakers, a UCSD 
medical student, a UCD medical 
student and a biochemistry 
graduate student from UCSF will 
be in attendance, he said. 

According to Dr. Stuart Brody, 
professor of biology here, lab 
hazards come in three types: 
radioisotopes, chemicals and 

. Radioisotope regulations reqUire that 
experiments be shielded so that the 
radiation emitted is less than two 
millroentgens per hour (mR/hr). 
Kirk Knutsen, legislative 

director of the UC Student Lobby 
in Sacramento, said the major 
reason for going to the legislature 
was of a denial of funding by the 
Universiry (of California) Regents 
last spring to provide for an 
ombudsman at each campus. 

"The university did not 
perceive of.a problem in this 

microorganisms. His lab uses 
microorganisms for its research 
in biochemistry. These can be in 
the form of bacteria, protozoans, 
viruses, etc. 

In his eighteen years at UCSD, 
Dr. Brody has seen "only a little 
sloppiness," and he feels the labs 
are well governed , he said. "You

not have something happen 
occasionally," said Brody. 
"Nobody has complained here. 
There may be some, but not 
here." 

Brody feels the CAPE 
publication oITers an adequate 
outlet for student complaints, but 
was not opposed to the idea of 
an ombudsman. "There is a very 
effective grapevine for hearing 
about these things at UCSD," he 
said . If, out of a class of 50, 
CAPE received 49 positive 
responses and one negative one, 
they'd be sure to print the one 
negative one with all the others,

Uib crowding is anotther 
concern and potential cause for

professors are able to limit class 
size themselves. 

"We're careful not to jam 
people in, but some (labs) are 
crowded," he said. Brody 
receives one TA for every 15-17 
students, he said, and despite 
the inevitable waiting list each 
quarter, he can limit the class by

Environmental Health and 

Safety, a university regulated 
department, operates to ensure 
that the State of Cali fo rn ia 
regulations are obeyed regarding 
such hazards as the use of 
radioisotopes. "We function like 
a liaison with the state ," said 
Many Malter, radiation safety 
officer at EHS. 

Radioisotope regulations 
require that experiments be 
shielded so that the radiation 
emitted is less than two 
millroentgens per hour (mR/ hr). 
Paper, plastic and lead are used 
to shield the diITerent isotopes, 
depending on the level of 
radiation they emit. 

Both Brody and Malter said 
that undergraduates are generally 
not exposed to high levels of 
danger. Graduate students, 
however, may come into contact 
with hazardous substances while 
doing research. 

Malter said Material Safety 
Data Sheets were presently 
available to students on 

microfische. Formerly at San 
Diego State UniverSity, Malter 
feels UCSD's safety program is 
excellent. All records are on 
computer and are updated 
continuously, she said.

Surveillance Committee overseas

committee can suspend such 
authorization if any vioiations 
are found , brought to the 
attention of the person 
responsible and still not 
corrected, Malter said. 

Labs are checked on a daily 
rotating schedule , Malter said ,

State of the Union: words and gestures 
After listening to Ronald Reagan's annual State of the Union address, 

it remains unclear how the utopian future of America described by the 
President will be achieved. His speech, which perpetuated the fallacious 
belief that we can have unlimited military spending and no tax cutS 
while balancing the federal budget at the same time, was extremely 
contrived, and crudely licentious. In fact, his objection to tax increases, 
is prefaced on the Republican misconception that they "asked the 
wrong people to tighten their belts." Of all the tax increases that this 
nation has undergone only a few, and these being under the realm of 
new deal economics, have really demanded that the "right people" 
tighten their purse strings; these being the members of the wealthy class. 

year 2000, which appears to be a key to unlock a prison door, the 
administration would like us to feel safe and secure with virtually 
nonexistent diplomacy, and skies filled with lasers. The President fails 
to acknowledge however, that every major technological advance since 
the beginning of the nuclear arms race has been promoted as the "last 
and necessary step toward the achievement of security," and therefore 
peace. As to why the United States is no more secure than it was prior 
to the realization of these technological advances remains a mystery. 
ShortSightedness, however, has never had the potential for such grave 
consequences. 

When President Reagan speaks of the "wrong people ," though. he 
asks that the nation not force him to tax his favorite "economic 
stimulators," these being the corporate overlords. His rhetorical 
flourishes, however, would lead one to believe that he is the guardian of 
the interests of the middle and lower classes of this country. This, from 
a man whose cuts in social programs have resulted in an increase of 
nearly eight million more people living below the poverty line; from a 
man who attempted to have the tomato reclassified as a fruit in order so 
that ketchup could satisfy the requirements of child nutrition programs. 

Reagan's bombastic address, with its rhetorical references to "America, 
the land of dreams fulfilled," Simultaneously encourages the myth of 
Horatio Alger, and reflects the administration's perception of the causes 
of poverty. If America is indeed the "land of dreams fulfilled," then why 
has the number of poor people increased? Certainly, Reagan torts, the 
drastic cuts in social programs are not responsible. The responsibility 
for poverty, it is implied, lies solely in the hands of the individual. The 
erosion of welfare programs, in the name of the sanctity of the human 
spirit, is thus justified. 

Another aspect of Reagan's program for "security" is his outlook on 
some very volatile conflicts in the Third World. These, he claims, must 
"bolster prosperity, liberty, and democracy where and however possible." 
This pledge would work quite nicely if, for once, as a nation, we would 
back the right side of a conflict. Such is nor the case. For example, in 
Cambodia, the administration supports two guerrilla organizations in 
their attempt to overthrow the present government. One is lead by Pol 
Pot, a known mass murdered and the leader of the brutal and terroristic 
Khmer Rouge. The second organization, which would send Cambodia 
back under monarchial rule , is lead by the deposed Prince Sinouk. The 
President would also like us to support the South African backed 
guerrilla movement in Angola called UNITA, which is ironically led by a 
Maoist. Jonas Savimbi. 

When we speak of the use of illusory justifications, we need to put 
into context the President's warnings of the "threat of Soviet 
domination ," that directly preceded his pleas for support of increased 
military spending. According to Reagan. such spending, specifically for 
the Strategic Defense Imiative , "promises to free mankind from the 
prison of nuclear terror." So instead of seriously considering the Soviet 
Premier's proposal for the elimination of all nuclear weaponry by the 

This policy can hardly be seen supportive of democracy. Our most 
poignant hemispheric example is in Central America, where Reagan 
seems quite comfortable in denying the Nicaraguan people their 
democratic right to self-determination. His dichotomous view of the 
world has now pitted the interests of the status quo against the 
demands for social change. By ignoring the social and political causes of 
instability and disorder, Reagan has implemented a foreign policy 
destined to futility. 

Vacuous promises of a perfect tomorrow do not bring society any 
closer to the achievement of that vision . Instead, these promises simply 
delude Americans and obscure the true cost of the President's distorted 
economic priorities and imperialistic yearnings.

In defense of Jill 
Editor: 

Matthew Cronin's January 30 
article, • AS. Press pass 
questioned" is an unnecessary 
and rash abuse of journalistic 
responsibility. Paradoxically, this 
article is representative of a 
worthwhile trend in UCSD's 
media: the critical examination 
of the Associated Student 
government. Perhaps this critical 
attention will inspire student 
leaders to improve their 
perfonnance in serving the 
student body. 

The article was libelous in its 
biased portrayal of Associated 
Srudent officer, Jill Lifschiz. I don't 
contend that the facts were 
false; the fault lies in the article's 
obvious lack of newsworthiness. 
Cronin's article was pnnted on 
the predominant news page of 
the Guardian . page three . Surely 
the news editor could have 
found a more appropriate news 
item? Who wants to know the 
tidbit, the mudclot, in the article: 
Jill obtained a press pass to the 
Bishop Desmond Tutu speech, 
possibly bumping a press 
member, and said she got it 
because she has "a lot of pull" 
(Note: the Guardian failed to 
indicate If this was said in a 
joking or serious manner.) 

This Incident Implies that Jill 
abuses her AS position , IS 
inconsiderate of others (the 
press), and is not the type of 
person who should be 
representing UCSD students. 
None of the implications are 

valid or faIT to Jill . I have met her 
as a classmate and know that 
she is conscientious, 
hardworking and loyal. In fact, 
she is the only AS officer to 
whom I would give this 
credibility. (Perhaps this is due 
to the grossly inadequate 
information available to students 
about the AS members. This is 
their greatest !law and it is no 
doubt tragic and unheroic.) My 
opinion of Jill is not inOuenced 
by any ulterior motivations, but 
simply by oberservation and 
interaction with her. She 
deserves to be defended against 
such thoughtless. although subtle. 
attacks by the media. 

I do not dismiss the fact that 
in the incident Jill's actions were 
wrong. It was a minor violation . I 
don't know a si ngle person who 
has not acted In a similar 
manner. The Guardian does not 
isolate staff members who take 
advantage of the state by taking 
long breaks. stealing university 
property. or obtaining other 
favors. 

I hope that the Guardian's 
readers realized the false news 
value and editorial mistake of 
printing Cronin's article. It did 
not deserve to be published In 
that form . The editor's deCision 
to prim the article lacked 
profeSSIOnalism although it did 
bring attention to student 
government. Much of the 
Guardian's past news concerning 
the AS has been ingratiating and 
surface-skimming rather than 
critical. ThiS is changing. and . I 
hope. for the better.

My curiosity about the 
structure being erected by the 
Bio-Med library led me to the

saw there a model for a huge 
multi -level parking structure. 
which Tom Corney. judging from 
his article "A Blueprint for 
Parking," is not aware of. Do you 

folks even know this office 
eXIsts?? It is located behind the 
bookstore. 

I suggest that someone on the 
Guardian staff be assigned the 
regular job of "construction

would visit the employees of the 
Architectural Planning OlTice 
weekly and report to us curious 
students the progress of present 
construction projects and the 
prospects the future holds for 
future projects.

Faulty reasoning 

Editor: 
In hi s Feb. 3 letter to the 

Guardian , Eldon Orr stated that 
"by remai ning in South Africa, 
American businesses can make 
the changes needed .. . insisting 
on governmental reforms to end 
apartheid ." This argument 
illustrates the faulty reasoning 
that is the basis for the policy of 
conslructive engagement. 

The denial of civil liberties to 
the black majority by the white 
minority in South Africa is 
fundamental 10 the whites 
remainmg in a position of both 
political and economical 
domination over the blacks. The 
economic resources that are 
provided to the white ruling 
class by foreign investment allow 
the whites to continue to deny 
blacks these rights. 

The Sullivan pnnciples, which 
are lauded as a solution to 
apal1held by the Reagan 
Administration . cannot pos Ibly 

bring about any meaningful 
change in the structure of the 
South African government. It 
would be naive to believe that 
the gentle prodding of the South 
African government could 
possibly bring about the abolition 
of anything but petty apartheid 
laws (such as those that prohibit 
interracial marriage and black 
unionization). Pro-divestors 
realize that blacks can only raise 
their position in South Africa if 
they have the vote; any other 
reforms are utterly worthless 
without it. White South Africans 
cannot possibly be coaxed 
through constructive engagement 
to give blacks the vote, as they 
would lose all of their previous 
economic and political advantage 
if blacks were allowed their 
nghtful say in their own 
government; the financial 
honeymoon offered by the evil of 
apartheid would come to an end. 

South Africa IS not JUSt a 
system with a few kinks that 
need to be ironed out. Evil and 
injustice are fundamental to the 
regime's survival. The situation 
does not require constructive 
engagement, but a total 
dismantling of its present 
structure . Students can, however. 
constructively engage with the 
UC Regents to abolish their 
policy of South African 
investment. 

South African investment is 
not necessary for Ihe survival of 
the UC system, but apartheid is 
n(!l:essary for maintaining the 
present unjust system of 
government in South Africa.

OPINIONS 

We need guns like we need a hole in the head 
By PETER MOST 

Tom Bradley. Mayor of Los 
Angeles, and an aspirant for 
gubern"torial office , recently sent 
up a trial balloon when he 
announced he could no longer' 
suppOrt gun COntrol. In 1982. 
you'll remember, Bradley ran for 
governor with a olatfonn which 
called for gun control. and he 
later blamed his defeat on that 
controversial plank. Rather than 
adhere to principle, Bradley has 
done a moral about-face and 
now says he can no longer 
sUppOrt gun control. And I can 
no longer support him. 

In his quest for an office in 
Sacramento, Bradley has chosen 
to ignore what he once felt was a 
societal problem worthy of 
remediation . Handguns are still 
the weapon of choice in the war 
being fought in our cities and in 
our homes. though His Honor is 
no longer interseted in this 
worthy cause. While this is a war 
surprisingly overlooked by the 
media. its prevalence cannot be 
dented and must not be ignored. 
Lax gun contol laws are 
responsible for our statewide 
dilemma, and it is nothing more 
than political cowardice tor 
Bradley to run from the issue. 

Of course . the problem of lax 
gun contollaws is not isolated to 
California; rather. it is an 
American ill with the destructive 
impact of the Vietnam War. 
During any given year 47,000 
American die in accidents, 
suicides and murders because of 
guns. In fac t, the FBI reieased a 

study which said that a murder 
is committed every twenty-four 
minutes. and ninety percent of 
those are by guns. 

While it is certainly true that 
our Constitution grants us "the 
right to bear arms," it is a right 
we have exceSSively exerciesd. 
There are reportedly sixty million 
guns in the United States. or 
about one gun for every four 
Americans. One can only wonder 
whether the original intention of 
the founding fathers was to 
create a gigantic national annory. 
However, we do know that when 
the Constitution was framed . 
America had just ended a war 
against a foreign foe , making it 
strategic to have a well-anned 
public . Today. we do not need 
firearms to fight the British . and 
we certainly do not need 
fireanns to fight ourselves. 

Opponents of gun control 
often repeat the adage "guns 
don't kill people, people kill 
people." The fact is. though . that 
easy access to guns such as we 
presently have, drastically 
increases the murder rate. 
Clearly, firearm deaths are the 
mathematical function of the 
number of firearms in circulation 
- given a certain number of 
guns in circulation. a predictable 
number of accidents will occur. 
Mayor Bradley recognizes this 
fact. but he has just decided to 
ignore it - for the sake of his 
campaign. 

Many Americans buy 
handguns under the guise of

"protection ." although the 
statistics clearly indicate that 
guns offer IitLle in the way of 
security. A National Crime Panel 
survey concluded that only three 
and one-half percent of those 
owning guns ever have the 
opportunity to use them while at 
home to disrupt the commission 
of a crime. A Presidential 
Commission concurred, finding 
that "a gun is rarely an effective 

, means of protecting the home." 
Contrary to popular belief, these 
studies indicate that a gun in the 
home is a feeble deterrent 
against crime; unfortunately, 
many Americans have placed 
their faith in firearms as an 
avenue to security. 

Guns are dangerous whether 
in the hands of friend or foe , 
and , it appears. especially 
dangerous if kept at home. An 
FBI report . Crime m the United 
States says that a gun kept in the 
home for self-defense is six 
times more likely to be used in a 
homiCide invlolling a relative or 
friend .than against an unlawful 
intruder. If you buy a gun to kill 
an intruder. the studies indicate . 
you are wasting your time, 
although it seems you might end 
up killing Aunt Agnes instead. 

The United States has the 
most lenient gun contol laws in 
the world. and. not surprisingly, 
it is also ranked number one in 
the world in deaths by gunfire. 
The first fact is directly 
responsible for the regrettable 
second. The gun contol laws 
currently on the books have 
done little to remediate the 
awesome problem faCing us, 
making it imperative that 
additional. lOugher laws be 
enacted. 

There is a prvalent fear that 
gun contol laws will prevent only 
the honest public from owning 
guns while illicit trade will 

continue to nourish . A tough law, 
such as the National Firearms 
Act of 1934. refutes that 
argument. Since the passage of 
this exemplary act, machine guns 
have become virrually extinct in 
the United States. disarming 
both criminals and law abiding 
citizens alike . 

Lax gun control laws are 
responsible for the societal 
cancer that afnicts us, and strict 
gun contol laws seem the 
obvious panacea. Of course, gun 
control laws cannot be enacted 
until the public recognizes that 

hole~ in the head . The public is 
loath to relinquish a right 
guaranteed by the Constitution, 
but today there is a much more 
Important nght that is being 
denied: the right to be secure. 
Nobody can be secure knowing 
there are sixty million guns in 
the U.S. and with each a 
potential killer. In the final 
analysis, it must be realized that 
strict gun contol laws are needed 
to restore seCUrity and peace of 
mind to a battle-worn public.

Love and madness; like Poe 
By PETER HIPPARD 

It was some years ago that I 
was a student in Mr. Bird's 
eighth grade English class. That 
was a remarkable class because 
of the personal concern, and at 
times, the passion Mr. Bird 
integrated into his teaching 
method. I have two distinct 
memories of Mr. Bird. the first of 
which is the most vivid. One day 
Mr. Bird strode into class with 
only a small book in his left 
hand. He took his place behind 
the Icc tum at the head of the 
class, and gazed down upon the 
group of naive, but curious 
students. Mr. Bird stood tall and 
thin, thought not at all lanky. He 
possessed a clear and captivating

Telltale hearts extinguish ...

heard many things in htll. How

Mr. Blrd's VOH.:e reverberated

recounted Poc's eene talc, How 
the madman had been dnven 
Into a loathsome manta b)' the 
old man's revolting, film-coated 
eye. The madman resolved to kIll 
the old man , not out of hatred, 
as he dearly loved the old man, 
but out of his abhorrence for the 
ugly eye, which made his blood 
run cold every time he looked 
upon It. SO late one ntght he 
went to the chamber where the 
old man slept, and pounced 
upon him kilhng him, as the old 
man let out a single shnek, and 
then fell dead, The madman 
hastily dIsmembered the body 
and bUrIed all the pam beneath 
the chamber's floorboards 

The Joh was cunnmg and 
clean, but the shnek had au sed 
a neIghbor to call the pohce. 
When the offIcers arnved , the 
madman, confident he 'd 
commaed a perfect cnme, bade 
them to seach the enme house, 
They ended up in the old man's 
chamber where they sat and 
chatted. The madman went so 
far as to sit directly over the 
place whre he'd buried the body. 
The conversation went smoothly, 

until the madman began to hear 
the sound of the old man's heart 
beat. The pounding grew louder 
and louder, e hoing inside his 
skull. Mr. Bird's eyes appeared 
aflame as he howled out the findl 
paragraph ' "V illains!" I shrieked,

untIl Mr Bird sat down at hIS

asked, "Any questions or

My second memory of Mr. 
Bird was some nme later that 
same year. I got along very well 
with Mr. Bird , he smiled at me 
around campus, and enjoyed 
talking to me after class. So one 
day, in the mIddle of a lesson , 
he called me to hiS desk and 
asked a personal favor of me . "I 
want you to dehver thIS note to 
Mrs. Bird; she's 111 room 451 
nght now," He folded a tiny 
pIece of paper, and handed it to 
me With an almost womed 
expressIOn on his face Feehng 
especiall)' pnvlleged, I walked 
acros campus and knocked on 
the door of room 451 Mrs. Bird, 
a ntnth grade algebra teacher, 
opened the door WIth a warm 
smile. "What can I do for you?" 

I held out the note, "It's from 
your husband . He asked for me 
to return With a reply." Mrs. Bird 
opened the note , smiled again, 
and walked to her desk. She 
scribbled on the tiny piece of 
paper, patted me lightly on the 

head and aid , "Thank you, and 
be sure to go right back ro class,

returned to class. On thc way

in his eye, I knew that thc}' were 
really in love, and the note didn't 
seem so bad after all. I didn 't 
know the n rst th lng about love 
back then, but at that moment I

strange. and she had to get away. 
One night, late at night in

his wire packed up ready to fly 
away. He became enraged and 
demanded she stay. He told her 
to unpack .everything and CUt the 
nonsense But she was adamant, 
and refused to stay any longer. 
When she motioned to leave, Mr.

Althuogh action against the

said it would .not he the last. 

For the past four years, an 
i1verage of 228,000 California 
students have borrowed almost 
$623 mIllion annually under the 
GSL program ror an averJge loan 
of $2.734 each year. 

By MARIKO TAKA YASU, 5", IUIl1f1110 Corre;ponde llt "My staff IS concluding the 
Investigation of a number of 
other institutions, and we Intend 
!O lImit, suspend or termmate 
any sehools from our loan

he sa id .

Loans by uSIng federal and state 
income tax refund~ they (the

the commission's ncwl),-

The California G L program, a 
federally subsidized program that 
proVIdes low-mterest loans and 
is guaranteed agaInst default by 
both the state and federal 
governments, "IS the single 
larges t source of student financial 
aid for Cali fornia students," 
CSAC executive director Samuel 
Kipp said. 

The colleges and universities 
participating in the program, 
however, have disregarded their 
responsibi li ties in making the 
program work, resulting in 
spiraling default rates , Kipp said. 

Over the last five years, the 
default nte of California's G L 
program has increased 
substantially from 1.8 percent in 
the 1980-81 period to 16.6 
percent in 1984-85 period 

"Over $720 mIllion m loans 
were guaranteed by our 
commission in 1985 alone, and 
we simply cannot tolerate a 
situation where the availability of 
loan funds ror the majority of 
students is jeopardized by the 
actions of a rew," Kipp said. 

University of California 
students received about $89 
million or 12.3 percent of tha t total. 

The default rate among UC 
students tS 7.6 percent or $19.2 
million The towl G L default IS 
$310.6 millton.

"When students default on 
their loans rrom this pomt on, 
thei r names (and) the fa t that 
they've defaulted wm be referred 
to credit bureaus," Kipp said, 
"and that negative credit report 
wi ll remain on their record and 
affec t their capaCity to secure 
other cred it until loan obligations 
are re tired ." 

The commission has also 
made arrangements with the 
state Franchise Tax Board and 
the Internal Revenue Service to 
confiscate income tax rerunds 
that are due to students who 
have defaulted and not made 
payment on their loans, he said. 
These refunds WII! be applied 
towards pa),ment of their 
outstandtng loan balance as well , 
he said . 

The Student AId Commission 
is also investigating the state's 
colleges' and universities' loan 
programs which have been 
targeted for mismanagement and 
abuse. 

The commission said it has 
sent a notice of Inte nt to

Francisco from panicipatin,g in 

All nme UC campus loan 
progr,\ms have been mvestigated 
sll1ce the program began m 
1979. Last year, UC Berkeley and 
UCLA were under review. 

CSAC requires that all colleges 
participating in the state's loan 
programs be reVIewed every two 
years The commiSSIon, however, 
has been unable to meet those 
requirements due to lack of 
funds, said California Education 
Loan Program spokesperson . 

Kipp said a number of loan 
program particpants have 
disregarded their responsibilltles, 
whIch has resultcd tn the high 
default rates. 

"This undermmes public 
confldence in this important 
program and threatens the 
integrity or the entire program," 

Studems who complete school, 
fall below half-time status or 
drop out, have a sIx-month grace 
penod before begmnIng 
repayment of the loan, to be

Abortion bill questioned 
By NONIE GANAKIS, Staff Writer 

T HE ASSOCIATED Students voted on Jan. 17 against UCSD's support of Senate 
Bill 7 (SB7) which requires 
wntten parental consent or a , 
coun order for women under 18 
to obtain an abonion, 

Eric Weiss, Executive Lobby 
Annex direc tor, submitted SB7 to 
the Associated Students along 
with a news release that is 
ava ilable to the public, with the 
hope of gaining support from the 
AS and UCSD students in "the 
battle agamst SB? which has 
already passed our state senate ," 
Weiss said. 

If passed , proponents of the 
bill claim that restrictions on 
abortion age will lead to "bener 
family communication," the news 
release stated. The Studem 
Lobby's position is such that 
improved family communtcatlons 
cannot be enforced by law, but 
rather "the legislature should only 
provide the tools for 
communication, such as 
Assembly Bill 1541 . which 
advises minors and their parents 
that confidential medical services 
(includ ing abortions) are 
available," the news release 
stated. 

In other states, laws similar to 
SB? did not decrease the number 
of abomons, but actually 
increased the total cases of 
infanticide by teens, not to 
mention runaways, the Student 
Lobby stated and added "that if 
Implemented In CalifornIa, this 
bill will cost taxpayers an 
additional $3.7 millIOn m court 
costs annually."

If Fletcher Christian and Captain Bligh had known 
what being stuck in the same boat would mean, chances 
are neither would have set foot aboard. 

And if you're stuck in the same boat with a long 
distance company that doesn't give you all the services 
you need, its easy to harbor mutinous thoughts. 

But when you pick AT&T as your long distance 
company, you know you're in for smooth sailing. You'll 
get trouble-free, reliable service, Immediate long 
distance connections-even at the busiest hours. And 
long distance operators to assist you with immediate 

credit for wrong numbers and collect calling. 
And you'll get discounts off our Day Rate on your 

state-to-state calls. With savings of over 50% during 
weekends until 5pm Sundays, or nights from llpm to 
Bam, Sunday through Friday. And 40% discounts eve-
nings between Spm and llpm, Sunday through Friday. 

So when you're asked to choose a long distance

to spectfic labs. Disometers worn 
both on jackets and fingers to 
measure radiation exposure are 
checked monthly and are 
carefully monitOred by EHS, 
Malter said . 

EHS regularly se nds out 
memos reminding the principal 
investigators of the responsibility 
they have to thei r labs, Malter 
said . "It's as if your mom said, 
'How many times have I tOld you 
to pick up your clothes?'" she 
said. 

Radiation safclY training 
classes are offered each quaner 
by EHS. The next will be a 
refresher class for users of 
radioisotopes to be held on feb. 
25, from 8:30-10:31 am in 
Medical Teaching FaCility room

Such classes are not required 
for lab personnel , but according 
to Malter are well-attended with 
40-60 in atte ndance each time. 
She feels response is better on a 
voluntary basis. 

Chemicals are yet another 
pOtential danger m labs. They 
can enter the body through cuts 
and abrasions, inhalation, or in 
extreme cases, as the result of an 
explosion.

there 's not going to be a

Health Advocates kick off 
National Condom Week 
By KAREN KAWASAKI, StaffWnter

dropped in conversations with those kinds of things rogether." 
friends; we see suggest ive A film, "Condom Sense ," WIll 
gli mpses of it in mo\~es or also be shown three times this 

tele~sion ; we see it implied In week: tonight at 7 pm at the 
adverusemems; we listen ro Revelle Commuter Lounge, 

They (condoms) do protect against 
sexually transmitted disease and are an 
excellent method of birth control." 

-Chris Oakley, Student Health Center 

suggestive musIc lyrics on the 
radio. In roday's socIety there IS 
vIrtually no escape from the 
word sex It has almost become a 
part of everyday lIfe, hke 
baseball, hotdogs or apple pIe. 

For th is reason , the Student 
Health Advocates ( HA), who are 
sponsored through the Student 
Health Center, are kicking off 

ational Condom Week, whIch 
begins today and WIll run 
through Friday. 

These five days were 
designated " ational Condom 
Week" instead of "V.D. 
Awarenesss Week" because "we 
think it will appeal to students a 
10[ better that way," says SHA 
Amy Perlstein . On Friday, the 
SHA program will set up tables at 
Revelle Plaza and Muir College ro 
hold free blood pressure 
screenings and to distribute free 
lIterature on binh control, 
sexuahty and sexually 
transmitted diseases. 

Since Fnday is also Valentine's 
Day, the SHAs, according to 
Perlstein, are "taking this week ro 
give an extra boost ro our 
education of the people in the 
fonn of contraception ." 

One of the main thrustS of the 
week concerns the use of 
condoms. On Valentine's Day, 
the SHAs will also be handing 
out up ro )00 free condoms, 
which were donated to the 
Student Health Center by 
Schm id. "The condoms that 
we're giVIng out," says Chris 
Oakley, a health educator at the 
Center, "have spennicide - an 
added protection factor that the 
regular ones don 't have. So we're 
gI~ng out high quality stuff." 

She continues, "One of the 
themes of the tables on Friday IS 

Wednesday at 7 pm at the MUIr 
Apanment Lounge , and Thursday 
at 7 pm at the ThIrd College 
Mountain VIew Lounge. At the 
end of each shOWing. the SHAs 
WIll hold a discussivn to answer 
questions students may have and 
will also show the students free 
condom samples. 

Undoubtedly. many students 
will make Jokes about the free 
condoms, but PerlsteIn 
comments that "there are some 
people who really want to know 
about using them, but the only 
way they can communicate is by 
Joking around . We (SHAs) are 
kind of used to it. But if they 
stop by the table and come away 
with any bit of information . then 
we feel like we've accomplished 
something." 

Oakley agrees WIth Perlstein's 
viewpoint, stating, "If they do 
Joke around , then it's our 
opponunity to make serious 
statements about condoms and 
the fact that now more women 
are 9uying condoms. That's a big 
increase in condom purchasers. 
They (condoms) do protect 
aga inst sexually transmitted 
disease and are an excellent 
method of birth COntrol." 

In addition ro the jokers, there 
are 'also many students who feel 
insecure or embarrassed about 
the use of condoms. In these 
cases, the SHAs try to help other 
students feel more ccmfonable 
about the concept. "There are 
some people who really want to 
try it and maybe are concerned 
about diseases and things like 
that," confides Perlstein , "They 
feel more comfonable comi ng up 
and asking another student 'Does 
it really work~' than asklng an 
elder. where they mIght feel 

'. ' ~ . :', " 
' .. 

. .' , 

, 

... .". 

.. 

. '. ' 

.,' 

. ' . 

really embarrassed . Most students 
really enjoy the fact that they are 
talking to another student." 

[t is this student to student 
contact which helps make the 
SHA program stronger. There are 
now almost 40 SHAs trained in 
ei ther General Health . whi h 
covers infonnatlon about the 
heart, stress, numtion . substance 
abuse , skin care and cold care; 
or Sexual Health . which covers 
areas of reproductIon , binh 
control, sexuality and 
relationships. SHAs. who are all 
volunteers, go on outreach 
programs to the donns and on-
campus apanments to hold 
semInars or programs and to 
provide blood pressure checks to 
other stude nts. 

Some other services that arc 
avaIlable to students are a cold 
clIniC, whIch focuses on what 
self-help tools a student can use 
[0 make hIS conclitlon a \inle 
more bearable; and the new Well 
Woman sessions, which foc us on 
thi ngs like nutrition, sexual 
health and birth control sessions. 

The SHA program itself has 
existed in its present fonn as a 
peer education model for about 
three years at UCSD. Most of the 
other UC schools have some 
kind of peer education program 
similar to the one here. 

Perlstein comments that, since 
the program's beginnings, 
reactions to the SHAs have 
become "more and more 
positive . People are gening more 
and more open to learning about 
health ec!;Jcation and to asking 
questions . They used to think 
that we were just a bunch of pre-
meds who were just hanging out, 
trying to get letters of 
recommendation. "Now they're 
realizing that we're really 
educated. We are trained and 
tested 10 see if we know the 
material , and we're reaUy out 
there to help . . 

I think people are really scared 
right now with aU of the sexually 
transmitted diseases - Herpes 
and AIDS - and they really 
want to know what's going on. 
Our whole point is to try to 
bring down the amount of 
sexually transmitted diseases and 
let people know that it's okay 10 
ask and be really open. You have 
a right to take care of yourself 
and to be infonned." 

Pan of how other students 

.. ' 

. . ' '.' ". . , 

Chris Oahley. a health educator at the Student Health Center 

learn about the programs is 
through a SOrt of "infonnal 
network." Oakley observes that 
"the Student Health Advocates 
live in the donns , they interact 
in classrooms, they spread 
information JUSt by being 
students. That infonnal network 
is sometimes more powerful than 
the 20 or 30 students we get in 
small groups for programs." 

Although students are viewing 
the SHA program more positively 
now, Perlstein still wants the 
program to become more visible 
on campus. She would like to see 
the administration 
acknowledging the SHAs as an 
organization and would like to 

see more students gening 
involved in the outreach 
programs. 'Someday," she 
comme nts, '')'d like 10 see 
orientation leaders letting the 
incoming freshmen know about 
us . A lot of freshmen are 
becoming sexually active for the 
fi rst time. I'd like to let them 
know that they do have a place 
to go, that we (SHAs) are here to 
help."

National Condom Week or any

through the SHAs, call the

Tasting the dregs 
of sweet cherry pop 
By KEN FURIE, Features Editor 

T HEY TOOK Mike through the electric doors and rolled hIm out of Sight in 
a wheelchair. Krista and I sat 
down for what we guessed, 
judging by the number of people 
in the emergency ward, would be 
a long wait. 

We sat down on chairs that 
had their backs to a waU , in the 
far end of the ward , and we 
made smaU· talk; speculating on 
whether or not Mike's leg was 
broken , making general plans for 
the evening, a.,d discussing my 
cenaIn death if Krista should 
ever catch me playing footbaU . I 
didn't tell her that it was I who 
was supposed to have been 
blocking for Mike on the play in 
which he was injured. The TV 
above us was shOWIng are-run 
of "Father Knows Best," and the 
occasional outbursts of the 
sitcom dialogue distracted our 
attention from the prevailing idle 
drone of conversation which 
blanketed the room. 

Krista indiscreetly tapped my 
thigh , and with a meaningful 
glance directed my attention to 
the seats across from us. Poised 
in the chair opposite me was a 
lady wearing a neck brace, who 
sat with exaggerated posture and 
held her nose high in the air . 
She was black, and had full lips 

and wide-flared nostrils . She 
wore glasses which were broad 
and thick, and they were 
reflecting the fluorescent light 
above us so that I could only see 
half of her eyes. Next to her, 
across from Krista, was a man 
who was probably the woman's 
father; he had a pot belly, laugh 
lines about his eyes and 
stanlingly white sideburns. 

We sat there in those seats 
against the waU listening to the 
TV. We stared at the couple in 
front of us and they stared back 
while the emergency patients 
flowed through the doors. Krista 
and I developed a relationship 
with the couple across from us 
although we never spoke to them 
directly. We suffered together; an 
uncomfortable situation brought 
about unexpected sympathies 
and hannonies among strangers, 
So when patients came through 
the door, Krista and 1 would 
exchange knowing glances WIth 
the couple across from us, 
although none of us really hnew 

anythin~. 
Later, there was a teenage girl 

with a splinter lodged under her 
thumbnail, and a boy in a soccer 
unifonn who couldn't walk on

Nutritional· Advice is 
not so hard to swallow 
By BARI SCHLESIGNER 

N UTRIT10N IS A wOTd everybody knows, but eating nutritionally is not 
always in the forefront of our 
minds. Students, especially, do 
not have the time to stand in 
front of the refrigerator and plan 
a well balanced meal. 

Eating properly is essential in 
order for the !:JOdy to receive the 
necessary requirements of 
vitamins and minerals. 
Unfonunately, most people do 
not eat three well -balanced meals 
a day; therefore, they need to 
supplement their diet. When a 
supplement is needed , however 
it makes no difference whether 
the vitamin is natural or 
synthetiC, accordi ng to Percy 
Russell , assistant dean of the 
MedIcal School. "There has been 
a recent controversy about 
changing the recommended 
dietary allowances of vitamins 
and minerals. The amount 
needed for prevention of 
deficiency symptoms is clear. but 
the amount necessary for optimal 
perfonnance is not. The way the 
recommended dietary allowances 
a re set IS quite reasonable ," 
stated Paul Saltman, biology 
professor. 

Eating properly provides the 
benefit of a wide variety of foods 
to choose from. According to 
Guide To Good Eathlg. the average 
adult should eat twO seMngs 
each of milk and meat and four 

servings each of fruit / vegetables 
and grain per day. 

Preparing these foods, 
however, ca n be tricky because 
we have [0 watch what we add 
to them. Foods tend to contai n 
enough sa lt without our ha~ng 
to add more . According to 
Saltman. one gram of sodium 
chloride per day is needed , but 
the average person consumes 8· 
10 grams per day. Sugar also 
needs 10 be watched because 
' over 50 percent of the calories 
you consume in a day is in some 
form of sugar," said Saltman . Per 
person per year, 142.6 pounds of 
total sweeteners (including sugar 
substitute). 126.8 are non-caloric 
are consumed, according to 
Dalynn Proffitt, health educator 
at Student Health Se rvices. 

Sugar docs not even gIve the 
amount of energy It is thought 
to . Sugar is effective for the 
moment , but the candy you eat 
to get a high should not be a 
substitute for a balanced meal. 
"There is more energy in a 
pound of fat than in a pound of 
sugar or protein , which have an 
equal amount of energy value ." 
stated Saltman. 

This is not to say people 
should eat more fat. A lot of the 
fat we obtain comes from the 
meat we eat, especially red meat, 
according to Saltman. This does 
not mean we should SlOp eating 
red meat. "Red meat is probably 

the best source of trace elements. 
iron , copper, manganese and 
many B-vitamins, and is a very 
good source of protein in the 
human diet," said Saltman. The 
"danger" of red meat is the 
saturated fat that accompanies it. 
According to Russell, 42 percent 
of our diet is fat. Nutritionists 
say this amount should be cut to 
30 percent. 

Vegeterians, who cut out aU 
meat and dairy products, are 
mIssing essential vitamins unless 
certain foods are eaten within 
hours of each other, according to 
Proffitt. For instance, grain and 
legumes together are good , or 
seeds or nuts along with 
legumes. Paul Saltman, however, 
feels that bei ng a true vegetarian 
is not healthy. 

According to Barbara Haggerty, 
Food Services Manager at Revelle 
Cafeteria, the campus cafeterias 
provide a huge variety of foods 
at each meal and every meal is 
all-you-can-eat. They try not to 
use butter on the vege tables and 
have cut down on the salt. 
Almost everything IS fresh except 
for some frozen vegetables and 
canned fruit, whi ch is canned in 
its own juices. MUIr cafeteria 
even has a vegetarian plate at 
eac h meal. 

Many people watch what they 
eat because they feel cenain 
foods cause problems such as 
acne . According to Russell , unless

"Olla 50% oj the calories you consume in a day IS in some form of

there is an allergy to food , It will 
~ot cause any type of problem. 
We can eat anything if it is done 
In moderation, including a candy 
bar or a piece of cake every 

once in a while. 
Watching what we eat is a 

good idea because it is important 
not to consume too many 
calories or fats . Saltmn feels the 
imponance is not in the amount 
of fat intake, but in the total 
amount of calories consumed. 

Many, however, would dIsagree. 
argui ng that fat is just as 
imponant if not slightly more. 

The really ImpOnant thing is • 
to eat three well-balanced meals 
and to supplement if you do not 
(vitamins can be harmful if a 
deficiency is not apparent). 
Eating one meal a day is possible 
as long as we eat from the four 
food groups and gIve our bodies 
the recommended daily 
allowa nces. Il:J

After we had waited about 45 
minutes or so, a small family 
came in . They were hispanic, 
and judging by their clothes, nm 
well-off. The man was supporting 
me woman, who was behaving 
as if she had a headache: her 
brow was furrowed and she 
brushed lazily at her beaded 
forehead with the back of her 
hand. They were trailed by twO 
young children, a boy and a girl, 
who were around six or seven 
years old and held hands. 

All four of us (the couple 
across from us, Krista, and 
myself) watched as the family 
progressed toward the 
admittance desk, the woman 
fumbling in her purse. I thought 
she probably needed insurance 
information . 

Then it happened. The 
woman's eyes rolled up , and she 
began to collapse, slumping over 
as suddenly as If someone had 
flicked a light switch . The man 
caught her as she fell and eased 
her to me ground , obviously 
trying to keep a brave face . 

But the children ... oh , the 
children. Whatever anguish or 
JOYs may come my way, I shall 
never be able to forget them. 
Their eyes became wide, glazed 
and circular, frozen upon the 
sight of their fallen mother, and 

as I watched, their eyes 
transformed . They melted into 
color, blurred pools which spilled 
over their lids and tumbled 
down their cheeks. They fell on 
their knees Simultaneously, one 
of mem murmurring a meek 
"Mama ... " With his back to the 
children, their father tried to still 
his trembling hands as he 
brushed the 
hair out of his 
wife's face . 

My heart 
leaped into 
my throat, 
and it seemed 
that a great 
fist clenched 
my lungs. I 
could not 
breathe. I 
looked at the 
lady with the 
neck brace 
and saw that 
her tears had 
broken free 
past her 
glasses, and 
she flicked at 
mem with her 
finger. She 
noticed my 
scrutiny, and 
smiled meekly 
in recognition 
of her 
weakness. I looked at Krista, and 
was not surprised at all to see 
her wiping her face with a 
k1ee!1ex. She was a good crier, 
indulging freely and frequently 
because of her many sympathies. 
But when she looked at me, her 

eyes grew Wide and hcr face 
became startled. 

I put my fingers to my face , 
and they ame away wet with 
evidence . Only then did I notice 
that I could breathe, and I 
became aware of a salty taste on 
my lips. Krista handed me a 
kleenex, and then passed on to 
the lady with the stiff neck, who 
simled her gratitude and blew 
her nose gently. 

Nurses and orderlies were all 
over the scene, and they took 
the fainted lady away on a 
rolling bed , the husband traili~g 

and helpless and doing a good 
job of getting in everybody's way. 
The children were left behind , 
and a soft whimper escaped 
from one of them. Instantly, my 
eyes smarted and stung me 
again , and I could not see 

through my rejuvenated lake of 
tears. I struggled for breath , and, 
when I looked at the children 
agatn, a nurse was with them, 
and she squatted down to 
confront the children face to 
face . 

"Your mother will be fine," we 
said 10 them emphatically. "Do 
you understand me?" They 
nodded slowly in unison. 
"Would you like to come with 
me? Come on, I'll get you a 
cherry pop. Do you like cherry 
pop?" 

I grabbed Krista's hand and 
led her outside 
into the fresh 
air so that I 
could calm 
myself and try 
to catch my 
bream. Don't 
think about it. I 
tried to force 
my mind away 
from it. My 
chest heaved 
with effort . 

We spent the 
duration of our 
wait for Mike 
outside. 

We took 
Mike home, 
and went out 
walking in the 
cold night air. 
We didn't talk 
at all; didn't 
say a word. We 
Just walked, 
with the smart 
breeze stinging 

our cheeks and tousling our hair. 
I don 't remember much of 
that walk. I couldn't tell you 
where we went or how long we 
stayed out. It was just very late 
when we arrived home. 

But there was a distinct 

change in Krista dunng our walk. 
She w'am's a pcrson any longer: 
she had no personality, no 
emotion, no affection, nOthing. 
That night during our walk In 
the cold night air, all she was to 
me was a hand . Not a large hand 
or a threatening hand , but a 
warm hand, a soft hand that 
knew just when to squeeze a 
little tighter. I cannot even 
remember Krista's face that night, 
although I often love to study it 
in the moonlight. She was just a 
hand, a hand for me to hold on 
to , and my only link to the world 
I had run from that night. 
Thinking back, it seems 
important to me that I wasn't 
bothered at all by the change 
that had come over Krista. In 
facl, I was extremely grateful. 
That hand was the greatest 
poSSible comfort to me then. 

When we got home at last, we 
stripped naked and gOt into bed, 
and she wrapped her arms 
around me, cradling my head in 
her elbow. A calm stole over me, 
and I closed my eyes. 

But in the darkness of my 
mind, my thoughts returned to 
the two children, and I felt the 
urgency returning, beating about 
my head with flapping wings of 
panic. 

I laid awake looking at the 
stucco-plastered cei'ing above my 
head, and in its pattems I could 
see those two children, especially 
their faces , as their eyes melted 
away to fall to the ground . And I 
can see the faces of my twO 
sisters, when they were almost 
the same age as the children in 
the emergency ward, and on 
their faces the same expression 
is engraved. At this moment in 
my memory, my sisters and I 
were also watching our mother.

By PHIL LAUDER, Senior Slaff Writer 

I was so bummed. Tossed into 
a tree? My bike - tossed into a 
tree. I was destroyed. It was 
destroyed . Well , maybe not. Today on "The Best oj the 

writer's i," we present a golden 
oldie. Perhaps you were snuggling in 
the bacn seat oj your Studebaker 
when you first heard this one. Ah, 
what Jond memories. And now, here 
it is ... from February oj 1984 -
hit it boys ... 

I LOVE bicycles. I love bicycles in a different way than most pearle who love bicycles. 
Most 0 these people received 
their first bike while in the crib, 
and have pretty much been 
eating, drinking and sleeping 
with one bike or another since 
then . They now own slick, 
streamlined "two-wheeled 
machines": aluminum beasts with 
every ounce of unnecesSary 
weight lopped off. They don 't 
believe in kickstands or reflectors 
or lights or even cute little 
tinker-type bells on the 
handlebars; it's aU extra weight to 
them. 

These aficionados - hardcore 
bicyclists if there ever were any 
- can often be seen at 
stoplights, balancing their 
motionless bikes with their feet 
locked into the pedals. (Q: What 
do they do if a sudden sideways 
gust hits? A Fall.) With your 
window rolled down while 
waiting at the signal, you can 
hear them babble about the 
upcoming criterium, how they 
did at the Velodrome last night 
and who was ranked what in 
Senior Division. 

I am not one of these 
hard cores. I do not wish to 
belittle anyone who is; I think irs 
fantastic that someone can get ~ 0 
into a hobby. No, really. 

I got my first and only bicycle 
on my eighth birthday. I was so 
happy. The bicycle and I became 
good friends over the next ten 
years. There was only one 
problem: the thing was a piece 
of crap. 

But it was my piece of crap. 
Ir was a metallic green 26" 

three-speed Hiawatha. That's 
what it was. Before I even 
touched it, Dad was in the 
garage, working on the gear shift. 
That gear shift functioned 
properly for a total of eight days 
in the ten years the bike lived. 
But I didn't care. 

I think I was above two-foot-
five on my eighth birthday. The 
top bar of the bike reached up to 
my ear. Dad attached a foam 
rubber scat directly OntO the bar 
and put two inch blocks on born 
sides of both pedals so that I 
could make a feeble attempt at 
riding mis thing. You see, this 
was a bike I was going to grow 
into, not out of. 

And then we went through the 
dad-teaches-kid-to-ride-bike 
ritual. Living in the country 
made this a little easier. Cenainly 
it made it less embarrassing, 
since no one could watch me 
("Gosh dam, Daddy, what the 
hell am I doing wrong)") Also, 
falling face first into dirt is more 
pleasant than doing the same 
inco asphalt. 

My birthday was in April. It 
was September before I could 
ride that thing on my o\.n. 

After tammg my bucking 
bronco, we became fast fnends. 
Through some 13 flats, a few 
snapped brake cables,

innumerable binding of the gears 
and the squeakiest brakes 
anywhere - I never have had 
qUiet brakes - we plodded 
forth. We overcame. 

Then we went to coUege . My 
first semester was spent as a 
commuter at San Diego State. 
After two days of trudging on 
foot from one line to another -
invariably located on opposne 
ends of the campus - I realized 
that there had to be a better wa y. 
And there was. I brought my bike 

Then 1 came to UCSD and 
tried the same trick. Each 
morning I parked my car on La 
Jolla Shores Drive, strolled to 
where my bike was locked up, 
and rode it to campus. 

I rescued it. Ever tried to 
recover a bicycle from a tall tree? 
Try it some time. I think I had 
an audience. 

After recovering the pieces , my 
dad and I rea55embled them. 
There was a principle here. 
Through some kind of voodoo 

One Monday I drove to 
school, parked my car and went 
to get my bike. It wasn't ·mere. It 
was no/ there. My mind was a 
whirl as I walked aimlessly in the 
general direction of campus. My 
bicycle. My Hiawatha! I couldn't

we got it running, and I brought 
it back to school. Nobody 
touched it again . Nobody DARED 
touch it again. 

LaSt year I got an apartment in 
San Diego and decided I needed 
two bikes: one for there and one 
for school. I kept my Hiawatha at 
the apanmem and brought my 
dad 's ten speed to school. Life 
was great. 

Then it happened. You'll 
notice that I've used the past 
tense throughout this tale, as 
though I were building up to a 
tragic ending. Well, here it is: my 
bike was stolen. Clean swiped -
lock broken and removed . The 
thieves - the despicable, low-
life scum of the earth - got 
away with a bike that to anyone 
else but me was probably worth 
eight bucks, maybe $12 in scrap. 
To me it was priceless. 

[ hope they're happy. 
Nowadays I keep my dad's ten 

speed in my hatchback and take 
it out of the car when I get to 
school. This bike , a chipped-
white Tease (you know, ishiki, 
Campanella, Fuji , Centurion, ... 
and Tease), has almost as much 
character as the Other; at It'ast its 
brakes can be heard for miles. 
But it's just not quite the same. 

Yes, I do love bikes - but on 
a lowl'r level than most. ~

Upland, CA

Management Science 

Two words be t describe Greg Kamansky as he steps onto thl! hardwood; 
he shoots. Not only does this junior guard shoot, but he shoots the eyes out 
of the basket, to the tune of setting a new record (40 points against Christ 
College) and averaging 17.3 points per game. Add to this dead eye talent the 
fact that he is second on the team with steals and third in assists and the 
picture becomes clear that Greg is an all-around Triton asset. 

In the month of January Greg really outdid himself, averaging 19 points 
per game on 51 % shooting from the field and 84% from the line. He was 
named All-Tournament for his performance in the La Jolla Classic 
Basketball Tournament and now stands as the second leading scorer in 
UCSD history . 

For his outstanding example of a ccmplete competitor and his sterling 
January performances, UCSD Athletics welcomes Greg Kamanskyto share

V-ball loses home opener in three sets 
By TOM FERGU ON, Staff Wntn 

A FTER uffering a major loss to San Diego State UniverSity last 
Wednesday, the UC D men's 
volleyball team was faCing one of 
the valleys of the 1986 season . 
Head coach Digger Graybill 
summed it up simply: "We stink, 
we played probably the worst 
that we have so far." The Tritons 
were looking to regroup both 
phYSically and emotionally in 
order to be up for their home 
opener last Friday against the 
16th-ranked Division I Loyola-
Marymount Lions. Their dogged 
play Friday night at the Triton 
Pavilion indicated that they had 
come together in comparison , 
but Loyola thwaned UCSD's 
efTons and the Tmons lost a 
close match 14-16, 10-15, 14-16. 

The first game began Wlth an 
equal display of control by both 
teams and the Tntons then 
gained momentum to take a 5-2 
lead The Lions then tied It and 
UC found themselves behind 6-
11 due to errors and their bemg 
unable to keep the ball In play 

But the TrItons came back 
again to tie it up at 12. Both 
squads were very strong at the 
end , but after numerous changes 
of posseSSIOn , UCSD fell short 
16-14. 

Statistically, UCSD finished 
game one with only 23 kills, WIth 
19 hit zeros (returned - no 
pOint) compared to Loyola's 23 
hlls and 18 hitting zeros, 
indicauve of the equal strength 
of the [WO teams. 

In game 2, the Tritons jumped 
out to a quick 5-1 lead with 
some very well-placed hits for 
points by Scott MacGregor, Scon 
Cnswell and Jeff Babcock, 
combmed with capitalizatlon of 
Loyola errors. The LIOns regained 
the momentum and eventually 
tied the score at 8-8. UCSD then 
fell behmd 8-10 , closed to withm 
one , but could not hold on at the 
end , losmg 10-15 

ThiS game also demonstrated 

the near equalIty of lhe two 
teams, WIth UC D posnng 43 
kills , bUI commmmg 15 errors 
and .+1 zeros; the Lions had 48 
kills 39 ze ros and 16 errors 

The lhird and final game had 
SIX changes of possessIOn before 
ther first point was even S ored . 
Then With the score tied I-I , 
eighl changes took place, 
followed by some extremely long 
volleys and back-and-fonh play. 
The Tritons slowly built up a lO-
S lead , but could not hold onto 
it. Loyola overpowered them , 
tieing the score and moving 
ahead 13-10. UCSD did not give 
up and , like the first game, 
forced the Lions to win in extra 
points 16-14 wilh some slrong 
hlttIng from Ole Sorlie . 

Loyola-Marymount head coach 
Kevin Kleary felt thaI thiS should 
not have been a comparable 
match Since hiS team is Division 
1 and UCSD is Division Ill , "But 
It was .. I'm not happy with our 
performance at all, bUl we 
seemed to Win all the close 
games and they (UC D) didn't." 
ThiS was hIS first observation of 
UCSD, and he seemed 
impressed by the Tntons' play, 
as well as the fans ' enthusiasm 
"Your fans are awesome," he 
said, "ThiS was a good march for 
them as well. " 

Overall, UCSD finished with a 
total of 64 kills, 63 hitting zeros 
and 27 hitting errors for a .296 
hItting percentage as well as 95 
serving zeros, 9 service errors 
and 6 blocking errors. The 
Loyola Lions did nOl fair that 
much better with 71 kills, 55 
hitting zeros and 25 hitring 
errors for a .304 percentage . 
They also had 103 service zeros, 
10 service errors and 7 blocking 
errors (all of these more than 
UCSD) 

IndiVidually, there were some 
outstandtng performances on 
borh squads. Loyola's Ole Sorlie 
led evetyone WIth 22 kill s, 

Men outclassed 
by Nazarene 
By MA IT LAlT, Staff Wnter 

FOR THE second time this season Point Lorna Nazarene College easily 
disposed of UCSD, 78-60. 

"The bener team won ," said 
coach Marshall after the 
Thursday night loss. :T.hey're a 
quality learn." The quality of 
Point Lorna's team was apparent 
as they definitely outclassed the 
smaller and younger Tritons. 

Although Point Loma led the 
entire game and was never truly 
contested for the lead, the 
Tritons managed to hang tough 
in the first half, fighting back 
from a 13-point deficit to go into 
the locker room trailing only by 
5,39-34. 

The second half was all the 
Crusaders, as they exploded to a 
51-36 lead only three and a half 
minutes from the starting whistle. 

From that point on , Point 
Lorna put on a show for the 
home crowd . Led by star center 
Deon Richards, who led all 
scorers with 29 points, the 

Crusaders' big men schooled 
UCSD's younger front line with 
clinics on rebounding and 
shooting. 

All the Tritons saw playing 
time tn the futile struggle in 
hopes by coach Marshall that 
some of his players could gain 
more experience for future 
games. UCSD was led in scoring 
by Bnan Backens with 18, 
followed by Greg Kamansky with 
12 and Andy Jedynak and Thor 
Dekker with 10. 

Four games remain on this 
year's Triton ~h.edule . The next 
twO are against Cal. Lutheran 
and Azusa Pacific. The final [WO 
are against CSU San Bernardmo 
and USIU on Feb. 22 and 25 at 
UCSD. Coach Marshall sald they 
must win aU four games if they 
are to get an outside chance of 
receiving an NCAA 1I1 
Tournament playoff bid . 
Currently, the TritOns are 11-
II. ~ 

Coach "Digger" Graybill and company lost a tough 3 set match to Loyola 16-14, 15-10, 16-14. 

followed by teammate KeVIn 
Ktnerk dnd Triton freshman Matt 
Bellers. each WIth 18 kills. Others 
Included Babcock (13), Criswell 
(13) and MacGregor (12) , as well 

as Loyola's Kirk Foniomoana 
(12). Setter Matt Anderson of the 
Lions ftnished with 62 aSSISts, 
and Triton se tter Eric Hallman 
had 55 assists. 

Note: Congrats to 
Fernando Sanchez and David 
Williamson for winning dinner 
for two in the Chan House Two-
for-Two serving contest!!! 

A less than angelic view 
of a one-sided rivalry 

By KEN RiRIE, Features Editor 

I AM TIRED OF all this stuff, San Diego. I watch Ted Leimer on TV, 1 hear it at 
Chargers games, I even have to 
deal with it when it has noth ing 
to do with San Diego. It's this 
rivalry business that you have 
with LA What about all this , 
then? 

I've been real tolerant, and I 
haven't pushed anybody. 1 
haven't flaunted the supenorilY 
of most L.A. teams to my friends 
who are San Diego fans. But 
during the superbowl , 1 heard 
the final straw snap, and 1 can't 
keep quiet any longer. 

We were watching the game, 
and the Bears were mangling the 
Patriots. 1 was watching with a 
Patriots fan, and I was being very 
tactful, and not even chuckling 
as the Bears scored touchdown 
after touchdown . My friend came 
out with the winning line. 

"Well , it's not so bad if the 
Patriots lose, as long as they're 
not losing to the Raiders." 

"Why?" I asked , surprised . 
"You didn't care about the 
Patriots until the playofTs, even." 

"Yeah, but I hate the Raiders." 
"How can you hate the 

Raiders? They're lust a tcam. The

.:. M. &z: YV .• Tntck vs :.caJ . ..!,uth~ran . 

, M. Tennis v!" Air -f6rce AcademY"' 

Chargers even beat them this 
year, so why are you still crying 
about them? They're a good 
team , can't you respect they're 
talent ?" 

Here , my friend came out with 
the clincher. 

"A good team] The Raiders 
suck! Don't talk to me about 
respecting their athletes. Those 
guys are baby-killers!" 

Baby-killers. "Hate the Raiders, 
huh?" 

"Hate them? Oon'( even talk to 
me about them . Those guys are ,a 
bunch of hacking, dirty, scummy

Individuals such as Cyndy Hake 
have made the trip before , bur 
this was the Trioton 's first 
exposure in the nationals as a 
team. 

The next twO race weekends 
will detennine whether or not 
UCSD Will again capture overall 
league honors. With UC Santa 
Barbara domin<lting the women , 
and tough competiti on being 
provided for the men by SD U 
and UC B, another learn trip to 
the nationals seems unltkely. 
.However, Cyndy Hake Will most 
lIkely represent UCSD in the 
slalom and giant slalom 

This weekend features the 
skliers In a super giant slalom 
race on friday followed by three 
race days In a row. Friday's race 
may give the Tritons a lift and 
help them prepare for their 
critical matches. Although the 
NCAA includes downhill racing 
as an event, the NCSA 
(sponsored by Lite Beer) 
discontinued the dqwnhill five 

years ago duc to .1 death dunng

Greg Balltnger has taken ovcr

young rookie learn members.

Dh me, oh my! These boys sky so high! 

Although the NBA All-Stars go through what is no more than 
a glorified pick-up game, this weekend in Dallas proved that 
professional basketball has the greatest athletes in all of sports. 

The East beat the West, 139-132, but who cares? The All -Star 
game IS an exhlhltlon that d isplays superhuman talents no 
mere morral can achIeve . And If you saw the game, you can 
understand why 

Dominique WIlkinS, the skywalkIng Human Highlight Film ," 
Without a doubt contributed the most dazzling plays of the 
game. After a couple of acrobatic power Jams he left the crowd 
in disbelief by making [wo 360 degree mid-air laY-inS, 
including one over the outstreched Wings of Laker center 
Kareem Abdul Jabbar. James Wonhy swooped to the hoop wah 
his trademark slam off the slam numerous times. Moses Malone 
kept the glass clean showing the rebounding svagery that made 
him the Chairman of the Boards. 

Kudos to you too, .. 
Congratulations are in order for Athleti c Director Judy Sweet 

on her election to the position of vice preSident for Division 111 
athletics in January. 

Sweet Joins [WO other VPs - one each for DIVision 1 and II 
_ as the main overseers of CAA policies. All three are under 
the main president of the NCAA, but it is common knowledge 
that each receptive VP is the king - or queen - of his or her 
diviSion vis a vis poltcy overseeing. 

Bert Kobayashi - next year's chair of the physical education 
department - Views the electlon of Sweet as ultra positive. "It 
really Increases UCSD's clout and Will help our program grow 
immensel)' in the future." 

Hopefully Sweet's clout Will Itft the Tmon program Into a 
class with some of ItS other UC rivals . Wouldn 't It be nice to 
see the Bru ins in the gym next week? 

Congratulations also go to the UCSD 1M program, enJoYing 
its finest year panicipation-wlse . SIX winter sPOrtS - basketball, 
one-pitch softball, soccer, team bowling, floor hockey and 
Hawaiian football - have all set new records. Kudos go to the 
referees, schedulers and head honchos who have had to absorb 
the new influx. Just think what they'll be able to do with new 
facilities being built on Third . Then maybe we can finally put 
poor Pry tel to rest. God knows it's time to install the parking lot 
that the field so richly deserves.

San Diego is the home of the world champion San Diego Sackers, People 
flock to the carpeted floor of the San Diego Sports Arena. 
The Sackers are not the only top quality team in San Diego though. Last

Rivalry? 
Continued from page 18 
baby-killers! .. 

Don't wony, pal, I thought to 
myself. I'won't talk to you about 
them anymore . 

Why can't San Diel!.ans think 
abour spans rationally? This guy 
is almost completely 

- representative 01 the type 01 
anitude fondled and cultivated 
by San Diego spons fans. I know. 
I'm from L.A. , and I've had to 
deal with it now for four years. 

Do you want to know what 
people from L.A. think about the 
rivalry? 

"What nvalry?" a pal of mIne 
from home asked . "San Diego? 
And L.A.?" he laughed. "Who 
cares about an Diego?" 

Most of the people 1 know 
from L.A., who have never been 
to see the Chargers at the 
Murph , aren't even aware of any 
nvalry. 

I , however, have been to sec 
the Chargers, I've seen the 
Sockers, the Padres many times, 
and I've even gone to see the 
Clippers, here in San DIego, and 
I've always seen the same thing. 
Extreme hostility , animOSIty, and 
pure malevole nce aimed at L.A. 
When 1 go to games In L.A. , I see 

an honest, yawning indifference 
to San Diego and its yowling 
fans. 

Why L.A.? I've thought. Well , 
most of the teams a~ JUSt plain 
better. Except, of course, those 
incredible Sockers, and I never 
heard anyone complaining about 
the L.A. Express being "baby-
killers." The Chargers used to be 
pretty good, and then the 
Raiders came to town . 

"Did you hate the Rams?" 1 
asked a native San Diegan and 
outspoken Raider-hater. 

"No," he returned. 
"Why not?" 
"Chargers never had to play 

them except in the playoffs , 
maybe." 

"And In the playoffs?" 
"I hate the Rams." 
Jealousy. I'd be Jealous too. If 1 

had a baseball team that. ... Well, 
look at it this way. The first tWO 
years 1 was here at school, the 
bIg deal with the Padres was 
whether or not they would finIsh 
above .500. Are you hidding? 
These people thought it was a 
winning season if their team 
finished above .500 for the year 

They would say, "Alright, so 
they fll1l~hed fourth ... but they 
were above .500!" Good God. 

I was mi crable when the 
Pad rei went to the World cries. 
NO[ because 1 dIslIke them . On 
the contrary. I like them a lot. I 
rooted for them to WIl1 111 the 
World Series, but I was miserable

that they got there . I wanted 
them to do consistently well , too. 
But 1 knew I couldn't hope that 
they would do well again; which 
was why I hated to see them in 
the World Series. Because every 
time some San Diego fan wanted 
to prove something to me, he 
would invariably mention the 
1985 Padre season . 

So they did well . Once. Now, 
every time 1 get disgusted with 
the Padres, when Terry Kennedy 

is barring .210 , when Kevin 
McReynolds lazily catches 
another fly ball one-handed , 
when Nettles strikes out and 
Garvey hi ts into another double-
play; I'm going to have (0 li sten 
to: "Yeah , well , they went to the 
W orld cries." So what?! 

And then there 's Ted Leimer, 
the king of L.A. haters. He 
instigates the most fo ul attitudes, 
and he IS the most biased, 

subjective, opimonated 
" ommentator" I've had the 
displeasure of watching. If his 
braying wasn't so funny, I think 
he would really an noy me. 

Even Leimer has to respect 
the Lakers , however. But hard -
core an Diego fans won't budge 
an inch. They root for Boston 
every step of the way. 

"Can 't you see," I complam, 
"Boston is just a bunch of 
hackers?" 

"No way, Ke n , those guys are 
hard-working, meat and pOtatos 
ball players." 

"Well , they're sure nor preny, 
that's a ll . Didn't you see what 
McHale did to Rambis? You say 
that wasn't dirty?" 

"Alright, Ken, it was dirty . So 
what?" 

·So isn't Boston the same team 
as the Raiders? Fighti ng in the 
trenches , struggling wi th pure 
meanness, Spit and spit again , 
finger-in-your-eye, fist-in-your-
face types? What's the difference 
between the Raiders and the 
Celtics?" 

"The Celtics are good . The 
Raiders such." 

"But they're both winning 
teams, man!" 

"RaIders cheat. Those goons 
are baby-killers." 

"So what's Boston?" 
'The working-man's team." 
Sigh. How can I argue with 

this? Baby-killers, huh? Give me 
a break. San DIego. [9 

8 ways to get a man 
to aslt you out again. 

1. When he mentions "The Bears," 
know they're from Chicago. 

I. Seem unimpressed when he tells 
you he scored a hat trick in the third period. 

3. Take his word for it when he tells 
you that 1984 was a very good year for 
Chardonnays. 

4. Laugh at l;tis jokes, e:ven when he 
forgets the punch lines. 

B. Avoid, at all costs, letting him see 
you reapply your lipstick. 

S. Order something more exotic than 
a white wine spritzer. 

7. Compliment him on his taste 
in colors, even if he arrives in jeans and
