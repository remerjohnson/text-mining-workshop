Students told of rights in bargaining 
BY JOHN BRICE 

Staft Writer 
"UC students, for the first time 

in the University's history, now 
have the right to actively 
participate in the collective 
bargaining between the 
University and its employees," 
said Allan Dailey. 

Dailey, who was hired by the 
UC Student Body President 's 
Council last month to educate 
students about collective 
bargaining, was on campus 
yesterday to inform students of 
their rights in this area. 

Dailey used diagrams to help 
explain the student's role in 
collective bargaining , a 
negotiation procedure in it 
infancy. 

Regents, will be represented on 
one side while the employees will 
be represented on the other side. 
The student representatives will 
be at the end of the table, 
supportin~ the interests of the 
students,' explained Dailey. 

Issues such as faculty office 
hours, class size, tuition 
increases as a result of faculty 
pay hikes and class interruptions 
due to faculty strikes are 
examples of areas of negotiations 
that concern students, Dailey 
said. 

Regents. 
One problem Dailey must 

overcome to successfully involve 
students in collective bargaining 
is how to compensate the student 
negotiators. 

"At first it won't take much 
time, (to be involved in collective 
bargaining) but later when weget 
into negotiations it will require a 
great deal of time and maybe 
some travel ," said Dailey. 

AS President Bill Topkis 
commented yesterday that "the 
experience it elf will be very 
atisfying. For a student to

The fir t three page oftoday'seditionofthenew

The theft occured in the Student Center's media

by a student with keys from another campus 
journal because there was no evidence of forced

interviewing tudents with keys ye terday. but 
hadn 't turned up anything. He had not reported the 
theft to campus police at the time of the Guardian

"I've talked to two groups, the new indicator and

Heiden hopes to enroll in Revelle College as a 
biology major next quarter. 

"We've received his application but no tran cript

Student housing? 
Not around campus 
Editor: 

I hope there are some 
people ou t there who are 
thinking about where they 
will live next year. 
Sophomores, juniors and 
freshmen are going to have to 
find some place to live next 
September. People living on 

. campus will haveit very hard 
getting a place. People living 
off campus now won't have it 
any easier. 

One might think this is a 
strange situation . By the 
hundretls, condominiums are 
going up all around UCSD. 
All the conveniences 
(shopping centers, banks, gas 
lations) are within a short 

distance from school and 
most of these condo 
developments. How come 
students are living 20 miles 
away from school? Or paying 
$450 per month rent? Why is 
there such a shortage of 
housing for students? 

The answer is simple, if 
not obvious. The develop-
ments in this area are 
directed at upper·middle· 
class income brackets and no 
one else. T he developers call 
our environs the "Golden 
Triangle": they make an 
inevitable killing when oneof 
their developments goes on 
the market. Merchants, 

seeing what kind of people 
are moving into the area, set 
up compatible trades: 
Bullock's Wilshire, jewelry 
stores, gourmet Spanish and 
Mexican restaurants. 
Definitely not tudent 
oriented establishments. 

All this is very nice. 
However, what do the 
aboriginal s t udents get out of 
it am Nothing. To acquire 
any form of local housing 
(University or privately 
owned) we have to pay for it 
through the nose. Cheap 
housing is. of course, 
avai!able in places like Pacific 
Beach, Clairmont or Mira 
Mesa. Even in La 10lla if you 
have 20 people in one 
bedroom. However getling to 
school from out ide Lalolla i 
murder. All the condo-
dwellers are fighting for a 
piece of highway at the ame 
time students are leaving 
from/ coming to school. 

The bottom line i that 
developers do not have their 
priorities straight. They are 
out there to maximize profit, 
not social welfare. The City 
Council wants these 
developments to increase to 
get a larger tax ba e; they 
couldn't care less about social 
equity either. 

The e developers could 
make plenty of money by 
building affordable housing 
for tudent and middle 
income people. The City 
Council should not care less 
about a tax base but should 
be concerned with ocial 
welfare . Something is 
definitely wrong. Something 
has to change. 

As Commissioner of 
External Affairs, I monitor 
the developments in the 
UCSD locale. I would like to 
get a group of students 
together to put pressure on 

the University, the develop· 
er , and the City Council to 
give students a break . When 
a propo al comes up for a new 
office building or a new high-
fashion store, we need people 
to go down to City Hall ana let 
the politicians know what 
the proposal means to us. 
Although developers talk to 
councilmen with money, we 
can talk to them with our 
votes and our publicity. We 
ca n use the university 
administration to put 
pressure on the city council 
to stop the unfair growth 

patterns in our area. 
External affairs needs 

students to do all this. If we 
had lobbied the city council 
several years ago we would 
not be in thi mess. However, 
we can still work things out 
with the developers. We just 
need people to work with us. 
Please contact me at 452-
4450, or by leaving a message 
for me in the Associated 
Students office.

which re-ha hed the same 
rubbish of that evening, 
indeed convinced me that I 
had understood all too 
clearly. No, mi understand-
ing or confusion i not the 
cause of our disagreement 
but, rather, a fundamental 
antipathy for each other's 
belief of what is Art and 
Feminism. 

According to M . Parry, art 
and women artists have 
suffered long enough under 
the oppression of what she 
call the "capitalist 
pat riarchy." Her social 
criticism is not wholly 
invalid, but then again it 
takes no Marxist to poi nt out 
the callous business dealings 
of the Art Establishment 
which convert art works 
into collector items, hence 
commercial commodities. 
But Ms . Parry upports 
Greer's view on private 
patronage, which she says is 
a form of "support and love of 
the art ." I thoroughly 
disagree. Original works of 
art shou Id never be owned by 
anyone, no matter how great 
the individual's "love." 
Appropriate reform should 
also be exercised in the 
ridicu l ous system of 
"limited" editions. 

Works of art, like works of 
literature and music (which, 
luckily, cannot be hoarded in 
quite the same way), belong 
to everyone for all time . 
Museums, therefore, are -
despite the scorn of Germaine 
Greer - still the best keepers 
of art works. There they are 
exhibited to the public. The 
complaint that too few 
women arti t ' works are 
being shown (a fact which 
Ms. Parry attributes to the 
oppression of the "capitalist 
patriarchy") does not in it elf 
invalidate the idea of 
museums. If women were 
properly encouraged to train 
as artists and art historians 
wit hin the mainstream of art, 
thi problem would gradually 

diminish and then disappear 
as would be oppressiv~ power 
of the "capitalist patriarc' 
h " y. 

But Germaine Greer and 
Ms. Parry do not want 
women to be in the 
mainstream of art. Rather, 
they advocate that women 
"subvert" the world of 
"sterile, cybernetic art" by, 
creating a type of "artifice' 
that will efface the 
dichotomy between art and 
life. What Germaine Greer 
proposes , in effect , is 
bringing art to life and life to 
art. Women, apparently, are 
to be the agents of this 
artistic revolution (she has 
no program for men , and, 
quoting Ms. Parry, . they 

hould "work consciously 
aware of how women before 
us worked, making beauty in 
the world ... " This pseudo-
femini t theory of art is the 
most astounding humbug I 
have ever heard. 

I wou ld not be so crazy as to 
engage in a weighty 
discussion over what is art, 
but I mu t point out that it 
can never be fixing a salad, 
gardening, or even quiltmak· 
ing (never mi nd those 
"bootie ."). Art is not life . Art 
must invariably reflect life· 
but therefore the two must 
not be identical. All good art 
is implicity critical of life 
(remember the iconography 
of the Charpentier painting) 
and cri tici m does not, of 
course, exclude beauty or 
delight. 

Most importantly perhaps, 
art mu t be a unique and 
original expression of a 
historical moment; only in 
this way is it interesting and 
a revelation of truth. This is 
why one can respond to 
people who say that their 
five-year·old could have done 
better: "No! The historical 
moment of this abstract 
painting has come and 
passed. Your five·year ·old 
must do something different 

but true to the historical 
moment to be just as good." 
Unfortunately these days it is 
often not the object itself but 
the artistic consiousness 
alone that constitutes art. 
This is what causes Greer's 
despair with mainstream art. 
Her answer to the problem is 
not a remedy, but only a false 
escape. 

Greer urges women to get 
out of the mainstream of art. 
This is stupid advice, for 
there is nothing wrong with 
being in the mainstream. The 
problem is bad art that is 
currently pro<h!ced by both 
men and women. Women 
should in fact stay put or get 
into the mainstream and use 
their talent with courage and 
originality. They can only 
"persist" (Ms. Parry's word) 
as artists through disipline, 
training, awareness and a 
cultivated and informed 
mind. 

Greer's suggestion that 
women avoid the main· 
stream~nd ret rieve a tradition 
of "femini n e" art is 
ridiculous. I have nothing 
against quiltmaki ng or 
weaving or knitting. The 
truth is I do much of it myself 
with great enjoyment, !!O I 
recognize the speciousness of 
her argument. In fact, all of 
the things Greer advocates 
for women I have done for 
years but no one in his or her 
right mind would think of me 
as an artist. Creative, 
perhaps, but hard ly an artist. 
Or does Greer believe that 
suddenly we shou ld reform 
our attitudes and call all 
creative women with arti tic 
impulse "artists"? 

It is a pity. really. that 
Germaine Greer has struck 
the term "craft man hip" 
(because of its a llegedly 
negative connotation) to 
repre ' ent the kind of 
"art ifice" she means . 
"Craftmanship" would at 
least limit the range of

NEWS BRIEFS 

Mystery pilot did 
not see PSA plane 

W S ANGELES - A 27· 
year·old San Diego depart· 
ment store worker te.c;tified 
yesterday that he had "no 
inkling" of the 1978 air 
collision that killed 144 
people in San Diego as he was 
completing a solo flight 
nearby. 

The collision of a Pacific 
Southwest Airlines 272 
jetliner and a single·engine 
Cessna on Sept. 25, 1978, sent 
wreckage and bodies 
plummeting into a resident-
Ial area of San Diego. After 
the crash, which at the time 
was the worst in American 
history, PSA cockpit tapes 
ind icated the possible 
presence of a third plane that 
may have confused the 
jethner's crew. 

Bu t Jerry Rossillon, a 
student pilot who was on a 
solo flight nearby when the 
cras h occu rred, told a 
Nationa l Transportation 
Safety Board hearing 
Monday that he never saw 
the other planes and didn 't 
learn of the disaster until he 
was back on the ground. 

"At no time did I see any 
other aircraft, although I 

. might have seen a Cessna 
172," Rossillon said. 

Rossillon, whowas piloting 
a Cessna himself, said it was 
not uncommon to see such 
small planes around 
Lindberfh Field, but he 
added: " do not r~all eeing 
another airliner." 

Ross illon , a student pilot 
who had logged in about 40 
hours of flying time including 
10 solo hours, was summon-
ed by the NTSB after it was 

determined that he might be 
the pilot of the so· called 
"mystery plane" seen by the 
PSA cockpit crew. 

He said the first indication 
he had of the collision was 
when he taxied off the 
runway after completing a 
one - hour flight from 
Lindbergh Field to Encinitas 
and back. . 

"I saw a column of smoke 
and to the south," he said, 
adding he assumed it was a 
fire. 

When he returned to the 
flying club headquarters at 
the airport, he noticed people 
listening to the radio intently 
but did not stop to ask what 
had happened and didn't 
learn of the crash until he 
turned on his car radio in the 
parking lot, Rossillon said. 

LA city strike

WS ANGE LES - With a

"Most people can go a week 

without a trash pickup with 
no problem," said Tadao 
Isomoto, assistant director of 
the Bureau of Sanitation. 
"But beyond a week, it is a 
cause for concern, especially 
with spoiling foods." 

Tras h collection is t he area 
most seriously affected so far 
by the strike, which also 
includes workers at sewage 
treatment plants, civilian 
traffic controllers and jailers, 
mechanics who work on all 
city vehicles in\cuding police 
cars and fire engines, and 
supervisors in nearly all city 
departments. 

About 5,000 workers were 
off the job again yesterday -
roughly the same number as 
have stayed out since last 
Thursday. The three unions 
- Local .347, the 3,000· 
member Architects and 
Engineers Association, and 
the l,2000'members Super· 
visors and Superintendents 
Association - represent 
about 10,000 of ' the city's 
28,000 employees. 

Pilots' union 
may strike 

LO S ANG ELES 
Directors of the 33,000· 
member Air Line Pilots 
Association have voted 
overwhelmingly to authorize 
a nationwide strike by next 
March 1 because of disputes 
over safety with the Federal 
Aviation Administration. 

The decision comes two 
months after the pilots' 
union urged President Carter 
to remove FAA Administrat· 

\ 

or Langhorne Bond. 
"We are concerned with 

the lethargy and inaction of 
the FAA in dealing with 
deterioration of the current 
air traffic control system," 
said ALPA President John j. 
O'Donnell. "We are concern· 
ed with the FAA's tendency 
to rubber stamp rather than 
regulate the design and 
manufacture of new air· 

aft " cr . 
On Oct. 21, some 400 pilots 

protest.oo in front of the 
White House. The decision to 
authorize the "suspension of 
service," as the pilots call the 
threatened strike, came late 
last week at a meeting here of 
the union 's 260 director. 

Twenty-nine airlines -all 
the major carriers except 
American Airlines, which 
has a separate union -
would be affected by any 
such walkout. The resolution 
left open how brief - or long 
- such a strike might be.

were pleased with the exhibition scrimmage and are optimistic about future contests.

"Now they under tand the

after the sc rimmage. 

BY JIM AGRONICK 
The men 's waterpolo team 

lo· t three tough game this 
weekend to major powers, 
barely escaping what wa 
suppo ed to be preparation 
for upcoming league final s. 
The Triton uccumbed to 
Pepperdine ]7-5 on Friday 
and 10 t Saturday to UCLA 
15·6 and Cal State Fullerton 
13·6. All matche were in the 
Los Angeles area pools. 

For a brief moment on 
Saturday, the Triton 
waterpolo, team had a 
glimp e of "big time. " 
Against UCLA, who is 
nationally ranked in 
waterpolo, the Tritons 
charged to a 2-1 lead after the 
first quarter. Unfortunately, 
thi lead diss ipated in the 
second quarter a the quicker 
Bruin offen e capitalized on 
several fast· break situations. 

UCSD's moment in the 
limelight was short , but the 
players were proud of their 
accomplishment. It was a 
replay of t he tory of David 
and Goliath. Here was a team 
from UCSD, where athletics 
take a back seat to academics, 
competing for a short time on 
an equal basis with one of the 
nation's fine t teams . 
Despite the final score, 
Triton coach Denny Harper 
said "There's no way that 
UCLA can feel that they 
haven't been through a tough 
ball game." 

Harper, who expected the . 
loss es to the weekend 
opponents , commended 
goalie Willie Morris. "Willie 

wa ab olutely awe orne. He 
stifled the Bruin by blocking 
15 shots and one penalty 
shot. A far as I'm concerned , 
he's the be t goalie in 
California." 

Morri was trong in the 
Tritons' other games against 
Pepperdine and Cal State 
Fullerton, but not strong 
enough to make up for a 
faltering Triton defense. 

The Pepperdine team was 
much quicker than UCSD 
and more comfortable with 
their 30-meterpool. Although 
the Tritons have spent the 
past week working out in a 
larger pool in Miramar, it 
wasn 't enough practice for a 
fast -breaking team like 
Pepperdine. 

Weary from the two prior 
games, the Tritons fell to Cal 
State Fullerton late Saturday 
in a hard battle The Fullerton 
game was probably the mo t 
physical of the three, but 
UCSD did a good job of 
stopping the counterattack. 
The Triton came up short, 
however, and were unable to 
maintain a strong effort for 
the duration of the game. 

Harper is treating the 
weekend' s games as a 
learning experience. "The 
game were pretty tough. but 
we learned a lot. I think we 
wi ll learn from our mi takes 
and keep a good attitude as 
we enter our conference 
playoff ." 

The games were particu· 
larly valuable for freshmen 
Jim Harry, the younger 
brot her of assistant coach 

Dave Harry.The rookie wa 
prai ed for his peed and 
nearly f1a wle s performance. 
"Jim will definitely be one of 
our strong future players," 
said Harper. 

The Triton are now 
gearing up for the conference 
play:off to be held this 
weekend. " The CCAA s 
(C a l i fornia Collegiat e 
Athletic A sociation games) 
a .. e most important. I'd like to 
be able to think of this past 
weekend as the weekend that 
caused us to win in the play-
offs. The play-offs will be 
competitive, but we're 
excited and everyone will be 
ready, " aid Harper.

Voyager 1 'dethrones' Titan

Few would survive

SAN FRANCISCO AP-
The United States might 
survive a nuclear war, but 
the horrors that would 
follow could be as bad as the 
attack itself as doctors fight 
a hopeless task of treating 
the wounded, some doctors 
say,

PASADENA. Calif. AP 
-Saturn's moon Titan,long 
believed to be the largest 
moon in the solar system, 
must now take second 
position behind Jupiter's 
Ganymede, scientists 
workmgon Voyager 1 data at 
theJet PropulSIOn Laboratory 
said yesterday. 

New skis go faster 
Readings returned by 

several of Voyager's 
experiments indicate Titan's 
nitrogen'rich atmospher'e 
must extend down much 
further than had been 
previously thought 

Until Voyager arrived, 
Titan's diameter could not be 
estimated because the moon 
is shrouded in dense clouds 
that make its surface 
invisible, But now Voyager 
data indicates that Titan has 
a diameter of 3.070 miles, 
compared with Ganymede's 
3.160. 

"Titan has been dethroned 
as the largest moon in the 
solar system," said Toby 
Owen of the Voyager 
"imaging" team. 

Titan also appears to be too 
warm at the surface to allow 
oceans of liquid nitrogen to 
form, except in the polar 
regions. Owen said, LIquid 
nitrogen rains may fall from 
the cloud layer, he noted, but 
the drops evaporate before 
they hit the surface. 

Owen added that Voyager 
data still has not shown the 
moon's surface. Titan's size 
was determined from 
indirect evidence, 

Owen said Titan is able t~ 

c'lntinued from page 5 
steel. The ski comes in 
only one size, with the 
following mea urements: 
106 cm long, 10.1 cm wide 
at the front end, and 8.2cm 
wide at the end. 

The radius of the arc of 
the ski, the taper from the 
front to the back and the 
sidewall and tail de ign 
combine to give the 
Scorpian its unique 
carving ability . The heel of 
the boot is set at 16.5 
centimeters from the tail. 
Placement of the turning 
axis so far back decreases 
the effort to initiate a 
turn. 

Other featur'es include: 
a reverse camber that 
makes turning easier; lack 
of a tail , decreasing drag 
by 50%; medium·soft flex 
giving good dampening 
and shock absorption; and 
length reducing amount of 
lever action created during 
a fall. In addition, the 
reduced length makes the 
Scorpian easy to carry, 
pack and store. The price 
is $150 

As a specIal offer to 
introduce kier to the 
Scorpian, the one-day 

rental price of $8.50 will be 
subtracted from the ski 
price if the skier elects to 
buy them, 

GLM offers a guaran· 
teed re ervation system 
which permits a customer 
to come into any store and 
be fitted for kis, boot , 
poles and clothing and 
reserve these items for any 
time during the ski season , 
thus being assured of 
having well · fitting 
equipment. 

Am o ng the many 
benefits of short , skis is 
that they enable a 
beginner to develop a 
reasonable degree of 
proficiency much sooner 
than he would with 
conventional length skis. 
Short skis have also lure{! 
people to the slopes who 
had previously thought 
skiing too difficult and too 
dangerous, Key advantag· 
es of short skis also 
include: greater safety, 
shorter learning period, 
more fun while learning 
with less stress on 
technique (no need to 
snow-plow), ea ier turns 
and stopping, and greater 
u e of lushier now and 
narrow trails . 

"As we move into the perilous economics of 
the BO's, those of us who stood together during 
the historic struggles of the 60's and 70's must 
oppose the new attacks by government and 

industry on labor militancy."

"The survivors will envy 
the dead," Dr. H. Jack 

. Geiger said Monday at a 
symposium in San Francis· 
co, one of a series of 
nationwide conferences 
being held by Physicians for 
Social Responsibility, a 
Boston-based group. 

In each city, the 
symposium focuses on 
posSIble local effects of a 
nuclear blast The series 
probably will conclude with 
a national symposium to 
consider overall effects of an 
attack on the United States. 

Geiger , professor of 
community medicine at 
New York's City College, 
drew a nightmarish picture 
of what would happen if the 
San Francisco Bay area 
were hit by a 2().megaton 
nuclear warhead. 

"Of 3.6 million people in 

A quarter of those injured 
would suffer from third· 
degree burns, said Geiger, 
and a significant number 
would be made deaf from 
the sound of the blast or 
blind from its intense light. 

" If you're as much as 35 
miles away and you happen 
to make a reflex glance at 
the fireball , you will be 
blinded because of retinal 
burning," he said. 

Dr. Howard Hiatt, dean of 
the Harvard University 
School of Public Health, 
opened the two-day 
symposium by saying that 
treatment of the wounded 
following a nuclear attack 
would be "hopeless." 

Hiatt pointed out that 
there are only 32 hospital 
beds in the Bay area for 
treatment of acute burn 
patients. In addition , some 
hospital facilities probably 
would be damaged and 
many doctors and nurses 
would be injured, he said. 

Erratum 
. Xesterday's story on administrative restructuring 
mdlcated that Chancellor Atkinson will consider four 
advisory committee proposals this week. In fact the 
committee's report will probably not be officially pre~nted 
to the Chancellor until early next week. Also the headline 
infered that the Chancellor will pick one of the four 
restructuring proposals. Atkinson may not necessarily 
follow t~at course of action. We apologize for any 
mconveOlence caused by our error.

the Imagmg team saId It tion Ophiuchus - the snake 
appears the mysterious carrier - located near 
spoke of dark material seen Hercules _ But Voyager 
on one of Saturn's rings will never reach its target 
res ult from interaction 
between the rings and the 
planet 's magnet ic fields . 

Carefully processed 
image of the spokes s how 
they appear to be small 
clouds of electrically-charged 
dust lifted ju t above the ring 
plane and then swept around 
Saturn by the planet's 
magnetic fields, Forthe mo t 
part, the fields rotate faster 
than the rings, Terrile said . 

The spokes had mystified 
scientists, because the rings 
have different rotation 
periods that would have 
quickly erased any such 
features that might have 
appeared, The existence of 
the spokes, seen to last for 
hours, defied common sense 
until the electro·magnetic 
field theory was advanced. 

Although the most intense 
phase of the Saturn 
encounter is now concluded 
and Voyager 1 is following a 
trajectory that will take it out 
of the solar system by the ' 
mid-I990s, the spacecraft's 
cameras will continue to scan 
Saturn until mid·December, 
when they will be perman· 
ently s hut down. 

Other equipment will 
continue taking readings of 
interplanetary space. 
Scientists hope Voyager will 
still be working when it is 
expected to reach the edge of 
the solar system and plunge

it is that that is the frequent

I certainly don't mind

Germaine Greer, however,

"Happiness at Lasf' 
Before f read Oianelics' by L. Ron Hubbard, I was successfully employed and making 
good income, bul deep down inside I didn't feel 
happy. 

"Then, on the recommendation 01 a fr iend, I 
started reading Oianeties. By the time I gol 
through the first chapter, I realized with great 
relief that here finally was a subject with the 
answers to happinessl 

"As I read on. I discovered the barriers I had in 
my life were in my own mind and that I could 
actually DO something about Ihem. The things 
people - and I - did began to make sense. 

"I became more secure and more in control of 
my own life. I raised my income. My long-time 
friends and parents mentioned how much hap-
pier and brighter I was. My relations with my girl-
friend, my friends and my parents got better and 
better. I started doing things I'd long wanted to 
try like music, writing, even painting! 

"Thanks to Olanetics. I came to really know 
myself and I've found real happiness at last!"
