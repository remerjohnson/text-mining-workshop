UCSD scientists announced last 
week that a metabolism-boosting pro-
tein, PCG-1α, may help restore cell 
function in individuals afflicted by 
Lou Gehrig’s Disease.

Lou Gehrig’s disease, or 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a 
progressive, fatal, adult-onset disease 
that occurs in roughly 0.0015 percent 
of the human population, and roughly 
the same percent of the population in 
mice — the model organism that was 
used in the UCSD study. 

About 5,500 people die from ALS 
each year. Humans afflicted with ALS 
generally begin to see symptoms in 
their late forties and live only three to 
five years after diagnosis. Most mice 
begin exhibiting symptoms of ALS at 
three or four months, and live a few 
weeks at most.

The medication Rilutek is the only 
extant treatment for ALS aside from 
pain medication. Rilutek can extend 
survival times for many late stage ALS 

patients by months. It does not pro-
vide any relief from symptoms.

A faulty enzyme, copper-zinc 
superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is 
implicated in both mouse and human 
ALS. How a faulty copy of SOD1 
causes ALS remains unknown, how-
ever. 

The researchers tested the muscle 
and cardiovascular functioning of the 
mice to see if there were any signifi-
cant physiological differences between 
normal mice that didn’t have ALS and 
ALS-positive mice that were injected 
with the gene for PCG-1α.

ALS-positive mice of both variet-
ies were also made to  run on small 
treadmills until they fell off and even 
electrical shocks would not compel 
them to get back up and keep running.

The team used two dyes, hema-
toxylin and eosin, to determine what 
fraction muscle cells in a tissue were 
actively performing mitosis at a given 
time. 

ALS-positive mice that had not 
received any treatment demonstrated 
slower response times, diminished 

endurance and reduced rate of mito-
sis, or cell reproduction. ALS-positive 
mice that had been treated with PCG-
1α, on the other hand, demonstrated 
none of these deficiencies. In fact, they 
performed as well on the fitness tests 
as normal mice without ALS.

However, though they did not 
exhibit any symptoms of ALS, the 
mice treated with PCG-1α died just as 
early as the other ALS-positive mice: 
there was no significant difference in 
survival time.

Despite this, the researchers said 
they are optimistic. One of the most 
heart-wrenching aspects of ALS is 
the suffering that patients face from 
diminished muscle function. In their 
paper, published in the May 2012 issue 
of Cell Metabolism, the researchers 
concluded that compounds including 
PGC-1α “increase muscle function, 
reduce atrophy and improve daily 
physical activity, thus resulting in a 
better quality of life for patients.”

Major 
Changes 
for Comm. 
Students

BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

The UCSD communication 
department unveiled a new curricu-
lum last week that lowers the num-
ber of required classes and eases 
elective restrictions for communica-
tion majors.

Critical Gender Studies chair 
Patrick Anderson, along with several 
communication faculty members, 
announced the changes, effective 
Fall 2012, at a town hall on May 2. 
Students who have already taken 
communication classes will be able 
to apply them to the new require-
ments without needing to make 
changes retroactively.

The communication major is 
originally 15 classes; the new curric-
ulum lowers the number of required 
classes to 13 by removing one upper-
division and one lower-division 
course requirement.

Undergraduate communication 
courses, which had been divided into 
general (COGN), culture (COCU), 
social force (COSF), human inter-
action (COHI) and media meth-
ods (COMT), will now run entirely 
under the four-letter code COMM.

Students will now only need to 
take  Introduction to Communication 
to fulfill lower-division requirements 
as opposed to the current two. After 
completing any two introductory 
upper-division courses, students will 
be cleared to take electives.  

Students can take up to three 
intermediate electives, or courses 
labeled COMM 101-119, and at least 
five Advanced Electives, which are 
listed as COMM 120-189.

According to Anderson, the com-
munication curriculum is nearly 30 
years old and needs adjustments to 
reflect changing times.

“We’re instituting these changes 
because the faculty has changed dra-
matically,” he said. “This curriculum 
is no longer applicable.”

Communication Department 
Student Services Coordinator Jamie 
Lloyd said that the new curriculum 
would also make it easier for stu-
dents to register for courses.

The department lowers 
its major requirements 
from 15 classes to 13 and 
eases prerequisites for 
elective courses.

Patients with non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease who drink one or 
two glasses of alcohol a day show 
lower risks of developing cardiovas-
cular diseases. Moderate drinking 
also prevents the irreversible liver 
damage associated with NALFD, 
according to a national study led by 
UCSD’s Jeffrey Schwimmer, M.D., 
Winston Dunn, M.D. and Michael 
Donohue, Ph.D.

NAFLD currently affects 40 mil-
lion Americans, or approximately 
one-third of the U.S. population. It 
is caused by the accumulation of fat 

in liver cells that eventually inflames 
or scars the liver. Obesity and dia-
betes increase the risks of being 
diagnosed with NAFLD. 

The cross-sectional study, which 
included 251 lifetime non-drinkers 
(zero drinks a day) and 331 moder-
ate drinkers (one to two drinks a 
day), showed that NALFD patients 
who are non-drinkers are twice as 
likely as moderate drinkers to devel-
op hepatitis or non-alcoholic ste-
atohepatitis, also known as NASH. 
Moderate drinkers also tended to 
have less severe liver scarring and 
were less likely to die from cardio-
vascular disease than non-drinkers. 

“The reasons aren’t entirely 
clear,” Schwimmer said in UCSD 
News. 

According to Schwimmer, alco-
hol can increase “good” cholesterol 
and improve a patient’s sensitivity to 
insulin. Since NALFD patients have 
low levels of “good” cholesterol and 
are insulin-resistant, Schwimmer 
thought that alcohol could help 

treat patients. Additionally, alcohol 
may have anti-inflammatory effects 
depending on the type of alcohol, 
Schwimmer said. 

Schwimmer said that the moder-
ate alcohol treatment may not be 
beneficial for everyone, and that 
each patient should be looked at 
individually. For specific stages of 
NAFLD, such as cirrhosis (advanced 
scarring of liver tissue) or NASH 
(inflammation of the liver), it may 
not be effective. 

In UCSD News, Schwimmer said 
that even small amounts of alcohol 
can be bad for patients with cir-
rhosis or NASH. However, he said it 
“may not be applicable to all forms 
of liver disease.” 

“I suspect modest alcohol con-
sumption will be an appropriate 
recommendation for many [liver] 
patients, but clearly not all,” 
Schwimmer said.

Since NALFD patients are two 
times more likely to die from coro-
nary heart disease than from liver 

disease — due to the increased car-
diovascular risks that come with the 
disease — the research team is now 
interested in seeing if the effects of 
moderate alcohol consumption out-
weigh the negative effects of alcohol 
use in other areas. They hope to 
reach a consensus on how alcohol 
consumption can be coordinated for 
NALFD treatment.

legislative and campus outreach com-
mittees.

“Each [committee 
will be] smaller in size 
and tailored toward a 
certain project and cer-
tain end,” Senate Vice 
Chair Matt Bradbury 
said.

According to 
Bradbury, the change is 
intended to maximize 
the efficiency of the 
committees by increas-
ing specialization and 
accountability.

“Each committee 
[currently] has too many 
people,” Bradbury said. 
“Because of that, there’s a 
lack of responsibility and 
accountability on each 
committee — only four 
or five people will know what to do 
with each bill and debate.”

The current committee system is 

composed of the Finance and Campus 
Affairs committees. According to 
Bradbury, councilmembers are divided 
between the two committees through 

an informal process. 
Each committee cur-
rently holds around 
20 councilmem-
bers and meets on 
Wednesday after-
noons. 

Under the new 
f o u r - c o m m i t t e e 
structure, an ad hoc 
committee will be 
created during Weeks 
7 and 8 to assign 
councilmembers to 
each committee. Each 
committee will have 
nine to ten council-
members. According 
to Bradbury, the 
“committee on com-
mittees” will be com-

posed of the four newly elected execu-
tives: the A.S. president, vice president 
of finance and resources, vice president 

of external affairs, vice president of 
student organizations and the senate 
chair. 

Bradbury said he proposed the 
four-committee system idea earlier 
this year and spoke with A.S. President 
Alyssa Wing about progressing the 
restructure. 

“Right now people don’t see com-
mittees as having much importance,” 
Bradbury said. “We want the commit-
tees to have an integral role.”

In addition to this restructuring, 
A.S. Council passed changes at its May 
2 meeting to the process of appointing 
associate vice presidents. According 
to Wing, each executive officer chairs 
the committee for the search for their 
respective AVPs. The executives cre-
ate their committees by getting vol-
unteers from council and randomiz-
ing the selection. The executives must 
now do this process with the A.S. 
Clerk in order to ensure neutrality and 
accountability, Wing said in an email.

n3chan@ucsd.edu.

“Students were having a bottle-
neck because a large group of trans-
fer students were coming in who 
were competing with freshman for 
classes,” Lloyd said. “The way that 
prerequisites were set up made it dif-
ficult for students to get classes.”

Lloyd also speculated that budget 
cuts might have had an effect on the 
reduction of the number of required 
courses.

“This might be a way for the uni-
versity to generate more revenue, you 
get the students through faster and 
you get more revenue because more 
students come through,” Lloyd said.

Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Education Barbara 

Sawrey said that the Academic 
Affairs Office had asked depart-
ments in 2010 to reevaluat e their 
requirements, but that no change was 
necessary.

“The university requires each 
major to require 48 upper-division 
units to complete a major,” Sawrey 
said. “We asked [departments] to 
relook at their requirements and 
communication was one depart-
ment that came forward and lowered 
them.”

Changes have also affected the 
administrative side of the depart-
ment. Around a year ago, the 
Communication Department  
became linked with the Cognitive 
Science Department, mainly for 
financial purposes. Lloyd said that 

any connection between the two 
departments would have no effect on 
the academic side of the department.

“[Combining administrative and 
financial managers] will not have any 
effect on students,” she said.

Any previous elective work in 
the major will be counted toward a 
student’s Advanced Elective require-
ment.

Communication majors must 
now complete the seminar require-
ment during their junior year. 

“The department will offer more 
sections of the seminar [in 2012-13] 
to accommodate the two classes who 
will need to take it,” Anderson said.

act, revamping voter 
registration at UC 

campuses, and the Fund the UC cam-
paign, among other efforts.

After some discussion, council 
passed a resolution against the UCOP 
tax unanimously with one senator 
abstaining.

“The end of the day, this is what 
we’re here to do is to protect that 
money and to protect our students” 
Associate Vice President of College 
Affairs Leonard Bobitt said.

AVP of Enterprise Brian McEuen 
pointed out to council that if the 
funds aren’t taken from campus 
based fees, they would be taken from 
some other part of the VCSA’s budget.

“Money has to come from some-
where, services are going to be cut 
whether its from campus based fees 
or other services from VCSA’s office,” 
McEuen said.

At the end of their meeting, the 
council had some fun with resolu-
tions honoring the members of coun-
cil that are either graduating or will 
not be returning. The resolutions 
declared them lifelong members of 
ASUCSD.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 10,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Before joining the working world all of six weeks ago, I teased my mom for her nightly 
ritual. With few variables, her 6 o’clock 
routine goes something like this: 
change into sweatpants and slippers; 
pop open diet Mountain Dew; after 
dinner, take unabashed pleasure in 
“Glee.” On Wednesdays and Fridays, 
she subs “sweatpants” and “Mountain 
Dew” for “pajamas” and “wine 
coolers.” (Sorry, ma — promise there’s 
a point.) 

I never questioned that my 
mom worked hard. But it seemed 
somehow implausible to me that 
working an eight-hour day in the 
office — one, I imagined, populated 
with all the customs I’d learned from 
“Ally McBeal” power lunches and 
client meetings and, I don’t know, 
“workflow”? — was really so grueling. 
The routine, I figured, was due to 
my mother’s natural propensities 
for comfort and flair: nothing says 
“business casual, my ass” quite like a 
pair of adult-sized Elmo slippers. 

And so I poked fun at the pajamas. 
I shook my head at the empty soda 
cans. And now, there is one very sore, 
slipper-cloaked foot in my mouth. A 
40-hour work week can be rewarding, 
yes, but it’s also consuming. If at the 
end of the day all I want is a pair of 
basketball shorts, a nice IPA, and a 
two-hour block of “Keeping Up With 
Kardashians,” then no, I will not be 
“sorry,” thank you. After a day’s work, 
I want a goddamn foot rub, too. 

That said, not everyone graduates 
to a full-time job, or a passable 
excuse for so much bad reality 
TV.  Everybody makes wandering 
out to be the most contemptible 
thing in the world. But if you have 
the luxury, is it really so awful to 
able around for a while? Is there 
something fundamentally wrong 
with biding time behind the counter 
at your hometown Starbucks? When 
I imagine the norms for twenty-
somethings not so long ago — for 
my mom’s generation, committing 
to an unwavering career path; and 
for my grandmother’s, wielding two 
babies on one arm and a cigarette on 
the other — working another unpaid 
internship doesn’t sound so daunting. 

I’m not saying the current 
conditions are ideal. Most of us are 
graduating with mounting debt, and 
job prospects are notoriously bleak 
for — ding ding ding! — recent grads 
in the humanities. 

But it’s also useless to complain. 
There’s value in taking a little time to 
re-evaluate before sinking further into 
debt for grad school, or committing 
to a path you haven’t had time to 
question. There’s value in testing 
options rather than considering them 
only in the hypothetical. In what 
might have been shocking news to 
the same 12-year-old that judged 
his mom’s nightwear, watching Sex 
and the City and Ally McBeal doesn’t 
actually count as exposure to freelance 
writing or law. And while I can’t say 
I know the true mark of adulthood 
after this past month, something tells 
me it might involve sore feet and a 
Bartles and Jaymes.

A Post-Grad 
Story: Not All 
Who Wander 
Are Losers

The UC Board of Regents passed a tax in July 2011 that may use student fees to fund 
the business affairs of the UC Office 
of the President. The tax, called 
the Funding Streams Initiative, has 
already been drawing from student 
funds at UC Riverside and UC Santa 
Barbara, but will not go into effect at 
UCSD until Fall 2012. The initiative 
aims to increase UCOP’s financial 
transparency, and while the tax was 
inevitable, student fees are for the 
students and should not be used to 
fund central university operations.

Previously, each university’s 
revenue was funneled to UCOP, 
which then took a 6-percent slice 
and redistributed funds back to 
each campus. Under the old system, 
student fees were not included in this 
revenue. UCOP will now be seeking 
the same funding through an across-
the-board 1.69-percent flat tax. Each 
UC campus will be allowed to keep 
their revenues (with the exception 
of undergraduate financial aid) and 
instead pay the flat tax directly to 

UCOP. The purpose of the initiative 
is to “simplify university financial 
activity, improve transparency and 
incentivize campuses to maximize 
revenue,” according to a September 
2011 letter by UC President Mark G. 
Yudof detailing the approval of the 
Funding Streams Initiative.

While the tax has the right goal 
in mind, it should not be drawn from 
student fees. Most student-initiated 
campus fees are meant to service 
the students, with initiatives such as 
building RIMAC, providing athletic 
scholarships and expanding Price 
Center to create Price Center East. 
When students place a referendum 
on a ballot, they aim to collect a 
predetermined amount of funding 
for a specific purpose. Students 
directly pay for the student-initiated 
referendums, and the taxation of such 
referendums is a perversion of their 
stated purposes. Students should reap 
the benefits of the measures they vote 
and agree to pay for, and not have 
to deal with hidden fees to support 
projects they are unaware of.

The A.S. Councils of UC 
Riverside and UC Merced released 
a November 2011 joint resolution of 
solidarity criticizing the inclusion of 
student-initiated fees in the Funding 
Streams Initiative. Jonathan Ly, 
ASUCM External Vice President and 
Keith Ellis, University of California 
Students Association Secretary, 

argued that “UC students should 
have the right to the funds gathered 
through the referendum to solely 
be used for its stated purpose.” 
However, the resolution to exempt 
campus-based fees from the UCOP 
tax was vetoed by the ASUCM 
President Miguel A. Lopez later 
that month. UC Merced Chancellor 
Dorothy Leland agrees that students 
should have the ability to choose 
and not be forced to tax themselves. 
To this purpose, UC Berkeley has 
abstained from taking from student 
fees. UCSD should do so as well.

As a result of this new tax 
measure, the UC Davis A.S. Council 
will have to cut an estimated 
$250,000 from its 2012-13 budget. 
The 42 percent budget cut may 
cause increased prices in the popular 
ASUCD Coffee House, Bike Barn and 
Educational Opportunity Program, 
or changes in the campus shuttle 

Taking Initiative 
A new UC system-wide tax created by the UC Board of  Regents will increase     

transparency, but student fees should not be a source of  its funding.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

See TAX, page 5

Dear Editor,
Nikolai Smith made many 

claims against presidential candidate 
Ron Paul in the May 3 issue of the 
Guardian. First, no sources were 
provided. Second, there are many 
examples that contradict some of 
the claims. Third, many of the claims 
have never been made before and are 
probably made up (the first 6 are lies). 
If you research Ron Paul and read our 
national constitution, you will find 
some of the claims to be false and 
others are true and constitutionally 
compliant. Yes, our constitution 
is still the supreme law. About 85 
percent of the federal government is 
unconstitutional.

Dear Editor,
Today, May 10, marks the 42nd 

anniversary of George Winne’s self-
immolation to protest the American 
war in Southeast Asia.  Winne, a 
UCSD undergraduate who was due 
to begin his graduate studies in the 
Department of History in Fall, was 
inspired by Buddhist monks who set 
themselves on fire to protest corrupt 
government practices in South 
Vietnam.  The sign next to his body 
read: “In God’s name, stop this war.”   

No plaque or memorial marks 
the site at Revelle Plaza where Winne 
took his life.  The location of an 
unofficial memorial is across campus, 
tucked away in the woods near the 
Snake Path and in the western shadow 
of Fallen Star.  Unlike these Stuart 
Collection art pieces, the Winne 
memorial is not marked on official 
campus maps.  In a similar sense, 
Winne’s story is not marked in the 
official history of UCSD.  It has been 
erased by slick videos and brochures 
that promote a fantasy image of the 
campus and a de-politicized version 
of its history. Although Winne was 
not affiliated with student antiwar 
activists on campus, he is part of an 
activist history that goes unaccounted 
for in official histories of UCSD.  
Winne’s act of protest came a month 
after the U.S. invasion of Cambodia 

in 1970 and a week after the Ohio 
National Guard shot and killed four 
students at Kent State University. 
For many young people, these two 
moments highlighted the underlying 
contradictions of U.S. institutions.  

Given the location of UCSD in the 
affluent city of La Jolla and in a major 
military city and border town, these 
contradictions were all the more stark.  
Winne was not an aberration — his 
act is tied to the larger frustrations 
and hopes of the period.  At the 
time of his death, Chicano students, 
black students and working class 
white students were in the midst of 
a struggle to find Lumumba-Zapata 
College (eventually Third College 
and now Thurgood Marshall). These 
students, Winne and countless others

Unitrans and number of student jobs. 
In addition, UCSB Student Affairs 
currently owes UCOP $700,000, 
leading it to solicit its student council 
to contribute anywhere from $99,000 
to $180,000 to fund UCOP by May 
30. Consequently, the student council 
has frozen student org funds for an 
indefinite amount of time. It is clear 
that drawing from student fees has 
caused financial strain on the student 
councils of these UC campuses, and 
will undoubtedly affect UCSD’s A.S. 
Council in a similar fashion. 

A July 2011 report issued by 
the California state auditor found 
that while UCOP was not guilty 
of excessive spending, it failed to 
be specific in accounting for its 
expenditures. The state auditor 
found that UCOP only uses a single 

accounting code, “miscellaneous 
services,” to label over $6 billion of 
its expenditures for the five years 
that the audit covered. This means 
that roughly 25 percent of the 
university system’s annual public 
non-compensation expenses are 
basically unaccounted for. The report 
also found a significant discrepancy 
in the amount of funds distributed to 
each campus. To cite one example, in 
2009-10 UCSB was allotted $12,309 
per student, while UC Berkeley 
and UCSF received $17,010 and 
$55,186, respectively. UC Merced, 
UC Riverside, UC Santa Barbara and 
UC Santa Cruz were also found to 
have received less funding than they 
would have if each campus received 
the same amount per student.

While differences in funding 
among the campuses may exist 

because UCOP does not distribute 
all funding to campuses on a per-
student basis, the new funding 
streams model will allow the 
university to identify and justify the 
reasons for any differences. Each 
UC campus does not have the same 
revenue sources, so the impact of the 
tax will be different for each campus. 
Some UCs have medical centers 
while others have more professional 
schools — these sources, many of 
which are fully privatized, should be 
taxed first. 

The tax is a win for transparency, 
and it is a plus that campuses will be 
given autonomy in retaining campus-
generated revenue and choosing how 
to allocate their funds. However, the 
bottom line is that the tax should not 
touch student fees. Student fees are 
for the students.

held on to utopian dreams of a society 
where freedom was not premised 
upon inequality at home and war 
abroad. Forty-two years later, we are 
located on a much different map than 
the one those students imagined.  We 
live in a nation locked in its longest 
war, a state that spends more money 
on prisons than schools, along a 
militarized and lethal border with our 
southern neighbor and in a privatized 
university that conducts research 
for the Departments of Defense and 
Homeland Security. Now, more than 
ever, it is important to remember the 
Lumumba-Zapata activists, George 
Winne and all those students who 
imagined a different future for UCSD 
and the world.

Join us this at Revelle Plaza this 
Thursday, May 10, at 4 p.m. to pay 
tribute to George Winne, Jr.

Dear Editor,
Police in Gyeongggi Province 

have booked two Chinese brokers 
and 18 students for faking documents 
to enter Korean universities and 
are widening their investigation to 
find more such cases. The Chinese 
students, none of whom are qualified 
to attend university in Korea, paid 7 
million won ($6,192) to 18 million 
won to each broker for a fake high 
school diploma and school reports, 
according to the police. The police 
informed the universities and local 
immigration offices of their violations. 

A broker surnamed Gang received 
7 million won from a Chinese 
surnamed Jang and helped her get 
admission to a language program at 
a university in Cheonan. The police 

are now extending their investigation 
to detect further illegal admissions 
in colleges and graduate schools. A 
total of 89,537 international students 
attended Korean universities in 2010 
with most from China, with 57,783, 
followed by Japan, with 3,876 and 
Mongolia with 3,333. The number 
of foreign students is expected to hit 
an all-time high of 100,000 in 2012, 
according to the ministry.

 I myself taught foreigners 
(other than the South Koreans 
themselves) as part of my duties 
as an English instructor at Mokpo 
National University. I was amazed 
that the number of foreign brides 
marrying Korean (mostly farmers) 
is now over 210,000. One privilege 
that is extended at that university to 
Chinese nationals, while not in the 
admissions process, is extra English 
help at no charge. Meanwhile, the 
University of California is reporting a 
big jump in the percentage of out-of-
state and international students who 
have been admitted for undergraduate 
studies. University officials said in late 
April that they’ve admitted a record 
80,289 freshmen at one of the public 
system’s nine undergraduate campuses 
to start next fall.  UCSD admitted the 
largest number. 

Sung Kim, the U.S. ambassador to 
Seoul, and Lucy Koh, a federal judge 
in the United States, are both from 
immigrant families. The erstwhile 
leader of Dartmouth College Jim Yong 
Kim, Ph.D. and M.D., was recently 
confirmed as World Bank President.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 10,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 9

F or all the riot grrrl movement accomplished, indie-rock is still mostly a boys club. There 
may be a seemingly never-ending 
supply of talented female artists and 
female-fronted bands — Grimes, 
Feist, St. Vincent and Tune-Yards, to 
name a few — but they’re often just 

seen as novelties, constantly being 
heralded as “woman who rock!” and 
thrown on objectifying lists like “The 
Hottest Women Of Indie-Rock.”

Bethany Cosentino of Best Coast 
understands this. A major part of the 
appeal of Best Coast’s debut Crazy 
For You was its tongue-in-cheek twist 
on the girl group tradition — com-
bining adolescent, Shangri-Las-like 
lyrics with a Blink-182 attitude — all 
while hitting the right balance of 
sincerity and self-awareness. And 
though detractors pointed out 
how much the lyrics were male-
dependent, there’s a confidence to 
Cosentino’s belt that makes her any-
thing but a helpless cat lady. 

Most of that hasn’t changed on 

Best Coast’s sophomore effort The 
Only Place. On tracks like “Why I 
Cry,” the band matches confessional 
lyrics that detail the inexplicable 
whims of depression with a more 
mid-tempo version of the sunshiney 
garage rock that made Crazy For You 
so popular. Meanwhile, opener “The 
Only Place” is a refreshing start, with 
the singer crooning about California 
in lyrics strongly evocative of the 
lives of this generation’s Golden State 
kids (“We were born with the sun in 
our teeth and in our hair / We like to 
sit around, sit around and stare”). 

But after that, it’s clear that 
Cosentino has taken a turn for the 
serious. Opting for slower, country-
tinged arrangements this time 

around (with the help of producer 
Jon Brion), she’s ditched the weed 
references for the most vulnerable 
pages of her diary, almost like an 
indie-rock version of Taylor Swift.  

The basic Best Coast formula 
is still there: an indie-rock twist on 
an old-school, female-driven genre 
— only this time Cosentino has 
opted to embrace Loretta Lyn over 
Ronnie Spector, allowing herself to 
revel more in the pathos she once 
covered up with jokes about her cat. 
It’s a commendable effort, though 
ultimately, not entirely compelling 
either.

MANAGING EDITOR 

S ince mainstream television has always been crowded by a plethora of police shows, it’s a 
bit hard to take the tired police pro-
cedural genre and turn it into some-
thing fresh. It’s utterly astounding 

how many more police shows are 
churned out every new season and 
how most of them flop regardless of 
the actual quality of the show. 

Maria Bello’s critically lauded 
portrayal of her gritty, unconven-
tional police detective character in 
“Prime Suspect,” wasn’t enough to 
keep the show afloat for more than 
a season. Even king of the genre, 
“SouthLAnd”, one of the most 
unique and realistic cop shows in 
the history of television, got can-
celled by NBC before the second 
season was even aired. Thankfully, 
TNT saw what it was worth and 
picked up the show almost imme-
diately.

But why all these television net-
works keep insisting on creating 
new, lackluster cop shows in such 
high volume is beyond me. Perhaps 
it has something to do with the 
numerous amounts of interesting 
“real life” scenarios that the world 
of law enforcement brings. Or per-
haps it’s that these shows appeal to 
such a wide variety of audiences 
that television networks just can’t 
resist. There’s no intrinsic problem 
with that per se, since you can’t 
fault producers for wanting to make 
some extra cash, but, really, if they’re 
going to do it, the least they could 
do is try to pretend to care. 

So, naturally, when I first heard

Performance and Film Screening at Calit2’s ‘Drones at Home’ Symposium
mated technology. In the American 
Southwest, a military drone crash 
lands in the backyard of a suburban 
home. The crash initiates a chain of 
reaction among the narrative’s seven 
characters (all played by Crandall), 
including the agency detective who 
investigates the incident and a truck-
er/cowboy who searches for similar 
crashes along the border. In addition 
to the stage action, Crandall will be 
supplemented by video and sound, 
creating a performance that is both 
intimate and dramatic. 

SATURDAY
On Saturday, “Drones at Home” 

will facilitate two panel discussions: 
“Drone Subjectivities, Mediations 
and Perspectives,” moderated by 
Crandall, and “Drone Economies,” 
moderated by UCSD’s own Ricardo 
Dominguez. 

The conference will culminate in 
a screening of writer/director Alex 

Rivera’s “Sleep Dealer,” winner of the 
2008 Sundance Film Festival’s Waldo 
Screenwriting Award and Alfred P. 
Sloan Prize. 

In the vein of “Brazil” and “Blade 
Runner,” “Sleep Dealer” is a take on 
the familiar sci-fi summer blockbust-
er from an entirely new perspective. 
In the near future, Memo Cruz (Luis 
Fernando Peña) traverses a dystopian 

Mexico, as a conflict broils between 
the military and local “aqua-terror-
ists.” After a remotely piloted drone 
attacks his home and kills his father, 
Memo travels to Tijuana (“City of the 
Future”) in search of work at a virtual 
reality labor factory where workers 
plug in — à la “The Matrix” — and 
outsource their work across the bor-
der. But as any tech-savvy filmgoer 

might’ve guessed, the factory is much 
more sinister, and its implications 
much more destructive, than what 
Memo had imagined. 

The film was praised by the Los 
Angeles Times and Wired for it’s 
sharp script and glimpse of a fright-
eningly plausible future. A.O. Scott 
of the New York Times called it, 
“Exuberantly entertaining — a dysto-

pian fable of globalization disguised 
as a science-fiction adventure.” The 
screening will be followed by a panel 
discussion with Rivera, and a closing 
dinner reception. 

The conference will take place 
in the Calit2 Auditorium in UCSD’s 
Atkinson Hall, Friday and Saturday 
from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. The event 
is free for UCSD students.

C FCF’s first album, 2009’s Continent, was essentially a distillation of several fash-
ionable musical trends occurring 
around that time. Michael Silver, the 
Quebecois producer behind CFCF, 
combined Nordic space disco, love-
lorn house music and the ethereal 
drift of ‘70’s German kosmische to 
stunning effect, surprisingly find-
ing room amidst all those perfectly 
rendered influences for a voice of 
his own. The Exercises EP sees Silver 
delving further into his own creative 
territory, proving to be the most 
intriguing record CFCF has released 
thus far.

Upon hearing Exercises, one 
(somewhat surprising) name imme-
diately comes to mind: Philip Glass. 
Across the EP’s eight tracks, Silver 
engages in the kind of gently poly-

rhythmic melodic layering technique 
originally pioneered by Glass and 
his minimalist contemporaries. 
This influence proves most fruit-
ful on “Exercise 5 (September),” the 
album’s sole vocal track, and likely 
the best song CFCF has recorded. 
In part based on a 1980’s composi-
tion by David Sylvian and Ryuichi 
Sakamoto, “September” combines 
a plaintive, repeating piano melody 
with washes of sparkling synthesizer 
and clean, spacious percussion. 

Other highlights include 
the dramatic, soundtrack-ready 
piano explorations of “Exercise 
6 (December)” and “Exercise 8 
(Change),” which finds startling 
middle-ground between the unpre-
tentious prettiness of The Postal 
Service and the contemplative atmo-
spherics of turn-of-the-millenium 
deep house.

The most refreshing aspect of 
Exercises is its concision: the EP 
never outstays its welcome, making 
its point in a breezy twenty-six min-
utes. This sense of restraint is admi-
rable, and results in a set of tracks 
that demands frequent re-listening.

A fter two years of waiting, Beach House’s Bloom has arrived to announce the 
verdict.  

Where 2009’s Teen Dream was 
a noticeable redefinition of the 
group’s style — the production a 
little less hazy, the songwriting a 
little more focused — Bloom acts as 
yet another graceful refinement of 
the beloved dream poppers’ brand 
of spacious soft rock. 

But this is not to say that the 
band hasn’t attempted to break new 
aesthetic ground.   

First and foremost, Bloom 
sounds more confident — a mark 
that can perhaps be attributed to 
the band’s more comprehensive live 
performance palette. 

At times, the duo swaps their 
rusty old drum machine for organ-
ic drum fills (as on the soaring 
“Wishes” and “Wild”) and reach for 
more ambitious, chorus–laden gui-
tar on the record’s epic shoegazey 
closer “Irene”. They even throw in 
some sly and synthy alt basslines 
on “The Hours.”  

The band has adamantly advised 
listeners against overindulging in 
their “vibes” at the expense of their 
attempt to develop as songwrit-
ers, yet this is admittedly difficult 
considering the immediacy of their 
wistfully catchy guitar-keyboard 
dynamic. 

Although their writing may be 
turning towards a more apparent 
sense of directness, it still takes a 
backseat to Bloom’s ideal role as 
a compliment to your summer’s 
breezy sunny afternoon mix-tape 
collection.

Anderson (“Rushmore,” “The Royal

(“Delicatessen,” “Amelie”), Shane Acker 
(“9”) and Peter Sollett (“Nick and Norah’s

a shoe-string budget, these films are a 
testament to the power of raw and inspired 
filmmaking at its best. (RE) 

about CBS’s new police procedural, 
“NYC 22,” I figured it was going to 
be a flop. Premiering a few weeks 
ago on April 15 as a midseason 
replacement for “CSI Miami,” the 
show follows a group of ethnically 
diverse rookies adjusting to their 
new NYPD jobs patrolling the upper 
Manhattan district. The worst part 
of all of this is that “Rookie Blue,” a 
much more developed show about 
to start its third season, has exactly 
the same premise, save for the fact 
that it takes place in Canada.

“NYC 22” is reaching its fifth 
episode this Sunday and things are 
not looking good. The entire show 
falls into a trap of mediocrity and 
predictability, complete with over-
done and cliched plots like: “Oh the 
person who obviously committed 

the crime is now confessing to it 
because you tricked him into doing 
so.” What genius! Or, “Oh my higher 
ups are disrespectful and don’t fol-
low the rules so I’m going to get 
upset because that’s just not fair.” 
Honestly, the best thing for this 
show now would be to just fire all of 
the writers. The acting isn’t bad, but 
the writers seem to only know how 
to recycle bland, generic stereotypes, 
leaving the cast very little to work 
with. There’s nothing genuine about 
this show and Robert De Niro’s 
production credit, combined with 
the star power of now-grown up 
child star Leelee Sobieski, do little to 
redeem it. 

At least with “Rookie Blue” 
there’s a “Grey’s Anatomy”-esque 
soap drama between all of the rook-
ies so you can trick yourself into car-

ing about them. In “NYC 22” there’s 
no aspect of any character that is 
dynamic, with the exception of the 
irritatingly infantile, angry facial 
expressions of Judy Marte as rookie 
cop Tanya Sanchez. Even the show’s 
strategic placement behind the very 
solid legal drama “The Good Wife” 
doesn’t help bring in the ratings, 
which, not surprisingly, have been 
decreasing by more than half a mil-
lion viewers every week.

Save yourself the trouble and 
don’t stay up for this one. You’ll get 
more out of re-watching reruns of 
“SouthLAnd”’s most recent fourth 
season. The comedic bickering that 
goes on between Lucy Liu’s sardonic 
female cop and Michael Cudlitz’s 
veteran officer, alone, contains more 
depth and authenticity than every-
thing in “NYC 22.” 

‘NYC 22’ Will Be Lost in Cop Show Shuffle

It’s no longer the 90s, and Garbage has updated their sound accordingly. Lead singer 
Shirley Manson has been repping 
the outcasts and misfits of society 
since the band’s mega-hit “I’m Only 
Happy When It Rains” became the 
glorious anthem for angsty goths 
everywhere. But after a seven year 
hiatus, Garbage’s fifth studio album 

Not Your Kind Of People tries to stay 
true to their original attitude, but 
with an updated and glossy techno 
pop sound, resulting in glaring con-
tradiction. 

The title track “Not Your Kind 
Of People” is a down-tempo, rela-
tively quiet number, whose lyrics 
“We are not your kind of people / 
you seem kind of phony / every-
thing’s a lie” hit listeners over the 
head with how ‘alternative’ Garbage 
still is, but, in doing so, seem to 
constantly emphasize the band’s fall 
from youthful relevance. 

Opener “Automatic Systematic”, 
kicks off with an uncharacteristi-
cally catchy techno beat — a sigh-
inducing surrender to mainstream 
pop aesthetics — spinning into a 
repetitive pop chorus that finds 

Manson chanting “I don’t want to 
be your dirty little secret”, borrow-
ing lyrics from, of all places, sugar-
sweet rockers the All American 
Rejects. 

It’s a bit unnerving, not to men-
tion sad, to hear such a sexually 
confident and respected female rock 
star sing like a tween-pop princess. 

“Control” is the only song off 
the album that seems to hone close 
to the band’s grungy and earnest 
alt sound, with louder guitar riffs, 
grittier vocals and a headbanger 
chorus. But the effort is ultimately 
too little too late in an album which 
leaves us wanting less glitzy pop 
rehash and more Garbage.

CLUB BASEBALL — Last weekend, May 4 to 
May 6, the UCSD Club Baseball team took first 
place in the Southern Pacific Regional Tourna-
ment, clinching one of eight spots at the NCBA 
Division I World Series, to be held in Colum-
bus, Georgia.

The regional tournament was held in 
Henderson, Nevada and featured UCSD, UC 
Berkeley, CSU Fullerton and the University 
of Antelope Valley. After losing game one 
and facing elimination from the tournament, 
UCSD battled back to win four straight games 
in two days, earning the title of Southern 
Pacific Regional Champions. The team will 
now be one of eight squads in the country 

competing for a national championship at 
the NCBA World Series May 25 to May 31. 
During the regular season, the team compiled 
an overall record of 19–4, while going 10–2 in 
conference play.

The Tritons also claimed the conference 
title in the Southern Pacific East Conference 
Championship division, beating opponents 
from the University of Arizona, Arizona State, 
University of San Diego and Northern Arizona 
University. 

The UCSD Club Baseball team has won 
two conference championships and a regional 
championship in its two years of existence, 
and is currently ranked No. 3 in the NCBA 
National Top 20 Poll.

BASEBALL — The UCSD baseball 
team looks to defend the CCAA title 
this weekend, May 10 to May 12 on its 
home field.

The Tritons have won the past 
three conference titles, and will go 
into the 2012 tournament with the 
first-seed. Their first match-up will 
be against fourth-seed Sonoma State 
this Thursday, May 12 at 7 p.m. The 
match will follow the game pitting 

second-seed Chico State against third-
seed No. 3 CSU San Bernardino, to be 
played at 3 p.m.

Going into the CCAA tourna-
ment, UCSD may have the home field 
advantage, but unlike years past, the 
Tritons had to settle for sharing the 
CCAA title. 

In 2009 — only the second time 
UCSD captured a conference title — 
the Tritons went 27–9 in conference 
to win the regular season title as well 
as the tournament title. The following 
year, UCSD improved its record to 

35–5 and in 2011 UCSD went 29–11.
The nationally unranked Tritons 

may not have met the high water mark 
set in the past few years, but the UCSD 
roster is still stacked with talent. 

It was announced yesterday, May 
9, that eight Tritons collected All-
CCAA honors. Junior Danny Susdorf, 
sophomore Garrett Tuck, junior 
pitcher Ryan Goodbrand and senior 
pitcher Tony York were all named to 
the CCAA first team. Senior Gregg 
Ringold was named to the CCAA 
second team, while junior Spencer 

Frazier, sophomore Justin Rahn and 
junior Richard Siegel all garnered 
honorable mention.

In his first year as head coach, 
Eric Newman was named the CCAA 
Coach of the Year.

Junior centerfielder Susdorf — a 
transfer from Division-I University of 
San Diego — leads the team in slug-
ging percentage (.560) and currently 
holds the program record for career 
triples (14).

Susdorf bats in the lead-off spot, 
followed by junior first baseman 

Richard Siegel, sophomore shortstop 
Garrett Tuck and sophomore utility 
Nick La Face. The four have proved 
very effective in the box for the Tritons. 

The Triton rotation also seems 
to have hit their stride going into 
the tournament. Junior starter Ryan 
Goodbrand (7–0) has notched 44 
strikeouts, and allowed only 23 runs 
in his 65.2 innings pitched. 

Senior Tony York leads the bullpen 
with the lowest ERA (1.27). He has 
appeared in the most games out of any 
Triton pitcher behind fellow closer 

Elias Tuma. 
On Thursday, the Tritons will face 

CCAA pitcher of the week, Sonoma 
ace Thomas Lee. Last week Lee went 
the distance against CSU Monterey 
Bay, pitching the first shutout of his 
career. 

The last time the two squads met 
was back in the beginning of April, 
when the Tritons swept the Seawolves 
in four games.

came into the 10k ranked eighth. Chang 
battled for second place on only her second 
10k race ever.

The Triton hurdlers were out in full force 
in the finals in the 400m hurdles as senior 
Caitlin Meagher took second, junior Lauren 
Irish fourth, senior Deyna Roberson fifth 
and junior transfer Raquel Ornsbey took 
sixth. Meagher also took second in the 100m 
hurdles while Ornsbey took seventh. 

For the jumps, senior Erin Langford 
managed third place despite having a torn 
quadricep in her takeoff leg. She also managed 
seventh in the long jump. Freshman Veronica 
Bradley took third in the long jump and 
second in the high jump at 5-foot-4.

On the men’s side senior Ka Wai Ng won 
the triple jump with a new school record of 
50’5.5”. Ng was the first Triton to ever breach 
the 50’ mark. 

Freshman Keith Rose — the younger 
brother of Jackie Rose — took fourth in the 
200m while also breaking the school record 
with a time of 21.59s. Rose took fifth in the 

100m with a 10.78, just .04 seconds off the 
current school record in that event. 

Fellow freshman Jake Herbold took fifth 
in the 400m hurdles, while senior Jeff Head 
took third in the long jump with a personal 
record of 23’4.5”.

Going into the final event on the men’s 
side, the Tritons stood in fifth place. But the 
Tritons bridged the gap on the backs of their 
javelin athletes. Brothers senior Nick and 
freshman Nash Howe, along with senior Kylie 
Libuit, boosted the men into third place. 

Nick Howe won the competition for the 
fourth time in a row, while Nash Howe had a 
massive personal best of 199’1” to take second 
place. Libuit placed fifth for a total of 22 
points out of the javelin. Nick Howe received 
Field Athlete of the Year for his 219’10” 
performance.

The UCSD Track & Field team now looks 
to the Last Chance meet to be held at CSU 
Los Angeles on May 12 before heading to 
nationals in Pueblo, Colorado on May 22.

UCSD also has a lot of momentum

Named yesterday, May 9, the Tri-
tons come in tow with three All-West 
Region selections — senior pitcher 
Camille Gaito, senior center�elder 
Kris Lesovsky and sophomore utility 
Caitilin Brown.

In the best of three �nal, UCSD 
looks dangerous. �e Tritons still 
have arguably the best pitcher in the 
CCAA, senior Camille Gaito (27–9). 
�e right-hander pitched �ve games 
straight to reach the West Regional 

�nal, and has an ERA of 1.21, but the 
senior has very little in the way of re-

Women Place Second, Men Third at CCAAs
Tritons finish strong behind strong performances in men’s field events, women’s sprints.

BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor 

Last weekend, May 2 to May 5, the UCSD Track and Field team took part in CCAA conference meet at CSU Los Angeles’ 
Jesse Owens Stadium. The Triton men took 
third while the women took second to cap off 
an exciting regular season.

In the first day of competition, Thursday, 
May 2, senior Nick DeBeaubien took fifth 
place overall with a score of 6046 in the 
decathlon.

“I really think I could have done so much 
better,” DeBeaubien said. “When I cramped up 
in the hundred on the first day, I just knew it 
wasn’t gonna be pretty.”

On Friday, the men’s field events started 
strong, as junior Ryan Eckert finished second 
in the shot put at 15.62m. 

“It was fun to throw that just wasn’t good 
enough for nationals,” Eckert said. “On the day 
though, it was good enough to place well for 
the team and help with points. It was really just 
the start of what I need to finish at the [CSU 
Los Angeles Last Chance Qualifier] meet next 

week to get to Nationals.”
On the women’s side senior Shana Emile 

tossed the hammer far enough for second 
place at 48.84m. Her throw was a personal 
record.

Going into the last day of competition, both 
the men and women’s squads trailed CSU Los 
Angeles and Chico State. 

On Saturday the Tritons came out with all 
guns firing. Sophomore Aletha Vasilakis and 
junior Jessica Miklaski started off the day with 
huge season bests, with throws of 40.06 and 
42.35m, respectively. They placed second and 

fourth to garner twelve points for the Triton 
women.

Senior Jackie Rose led the women in the 
track events. The senior sprints captain won 
the 400m with a time of 54.70 but was still 
disappointed that she could not claim the 
CCAA record. Rose came back less than five 
minutes later and ran fast enough for sixth 
in the 100m, and then again lined up for the 
200m. 

“I’ve only run four 200m races this year 
so I wasn’t very well prepared for the 200m,” 
Rose said. “The thing that was on my mind 
was how last year at Nationals, there was a girl 
who won the 400m and the 200m even though 
the events were back to back. I want to be that 
girl this year, and I put everything out on the 
line and I won.”

Rose’s wins didn’t stop with the 200m as she 
anchored the winning 4x400m team of junior 
Deyna Roberson, sophomore Lauren Irish and 
freshman Sabrina Pimentel.

For Rose’s efforts — running and winning 
more than a mile of sprints events — she was 
awarded CCAA Track Athlete of the Year. 
She is the most recent of a string of great 
UCSD runners to win this award following 
Sri Lankan Olympian Christine Merrill and 
professional runner Kelly Fogarty. 

Pimentel also had a great day, receiving 
Freshman of the Year honors for her 2:16 
800m time while also medaling as part of the 
4x400m team.

distances was sophomore Chia Chang who

SOFTBALL — A�er taking the CCAA title 
to claim the sixth-seed in the West Region-
als, the No. 24 UCSD So�ball team will 
advance to the Regional Final against �rst-
seed CSU Dominguez Hills this weekend, 
May 11 to May 12.

�e Toros tied for the regular season 
title with CSU Monterey Bay — both teams 
�nished with a 27–7 record in conference. 

�e Tritons have faced the Toros on �ve 
occasions this season. UCSD took a 1–0 
win against the Toros in its CCAA tourna-

ment opener. UCSD won three of its four 
games against the Toros back in March in 
its conference home series.

But with the No. 1 seed, the Toros will 
host the West Region �nal — and the To-
ros are undefeated at home. In 2012, CSU 
Dominguez Hills is currently 27–0 at Toro 
Stadium. 

Dominguez Hills went 3–0 in their 
regional bracket, taking two wins from 
fourth-seed Grand Canyon University and 
��h-seed Sonoma State last weekend, May 
5 to May 6.
