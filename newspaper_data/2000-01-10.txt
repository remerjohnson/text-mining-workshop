TIJUANA, Mexico - In the 
long, lurid history of drug traf-
ficking along Mexico's border 
with the United States, perhaps 
no fugitives have been more 
notorious than the six brothers 
Arellano Felix. 

Since 1993, when gunmen 
working for them murdered a 
Roman Catholic cardinal, several 
of the brothers have been among 
the most wanted men in Mexico. 
In 1997, after the Arellanos were '

Major League Baseball 
seemed to suggest it was last 
week when commissioner Bud 
Selig demanded that Atlanta 
Braves pitcher John Rocker 
undergo psychological testing, 
after his remarks about immi-

But Selig's move may have 
more to do with politics and a

worries about his mental health, 
say experts who study sports.

Bill Cosby 
May Lead 
Ceremony 
COMMENCEMENT: 
Cosby's $150,000 fee 
might be a deterrent 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Staff Writer 

Bill Cosby heads the list of 
possible candidates to speak at 
all-campus graduation com-
mencement this June. 

Earlier in November, the A.S. 
Council voted for its top 15 possi-
ble guest speakers, and Cosby 
was at the top of the list . 

"Everyone knows who 
[Cosby) is," said A.S. program-
mer Scott Mantell. "He is some-
one we all grew up with and we 
all love from all those Jell-O com-
mercials." 

Mantell also said that CosPy is 
a good selection because he is 
well-respected for his contribu-
tions to society. 

"Students recognize Cosby 
for what he does for education, 
for equality and for opportunity" 
he said. "I think he would be a 
good representation of what the 
school and the students here are 
about." 

Along with Cosby's educa-
tional background as a graduate 
of Temple University, Mantell 
said Cosby would most likely 
give a very meaningful speech. 

"I am confident he would 
give a quality speech that would 
be well-taken by students and 
their families as well," Mantell 
said. "The attendance level [for 
graduation) would definitely be 
high." 

However, Mantell is not cer-
tain of Cosby's willingness to 
speak and he is also uncertain of

oanuUY: Sven Gillett Peterson enjoyed graphic arts, cooking, computers and music 
By ICOn DOBROSKI 
Staff Writer 

Warren junior Sven Gillett 
Peterson, 20, died on his way 
home for winter break in a car 
crash on Interstate 5 while trav-
eling through Buttonwillow, 
Calif. on Dec. 23. 

Peterson, a psychology major 
who worked part time at La Jolla 
Village Family Medical Group, 
was a proud and creative UCSD 
student. 

He died when a GMC van 
carrying a family of four crossed 
over a dirt median on 1-5 and 
crashed into his Audi sedan. 

The van was driven by Eric 
Menchaca, a 42-year-old youth 
minister &om San J~ and was 

carrying his wife Lucila and their 
two daughters - Rosa, 12, and 
Vanessa, 8. The two girls were 
ejected out of the van and neither 
was wearing a seat belt. All four 
passengers and Peterson died on 
impact. 

California Highway Patrol 
Public Affairs Officer Layne said 
that remnants of a Jack in the Box 

~al found scattered throughout 
Menchaca's car may point to the 
cause of the accident. 

"Mr. Menchaca was probably 
falling asleep at the wheel or 
attempting to eat and drive," 
Logan said. "Unfortunately this 
is a pJime example of what not to 
do when driving late. I can't teU 
you how crucial it is to simply 
pun over w~ ,YOU:le ~ 

sleepy or just trying to eat some-
thing. It can save lives." 

Peterson's father said that he 
was a very good student, but 
had not yet settled on a career. 

"For several years, [Peterson) 
dreamed of becoming a cartoon-
ist," Terry Peterson said. "He 
brought the careful and meticu-
lous attention to detail he'd 
learned in this pastime to all his 
later activities, including cook-
ing for the family." 

Peterson graduated from 
Monta Vista Hig~ School in 
Cupertino, Calif. and was an 
active band member there. At 
UCSD, his two roommates were 
also band members from Monta 
Vista. 

Peterson's friends described 

him as a happy and proud UCSD 
student who loved the universi-
ty, and as an inventive, serious 
student who was well-Liked by 
both teachers and classmates. 
Peterson's friends also character-
ized him as having an extremely 
keen sense of humor, consistent-
ly amusing them with his witty 
remarks. 

Peterson's mother said that 
she's still coming to grips with 
his death. 

"I feel bereft," Susan Peterson 
said." "It's easy to think that it's 
not real. You hope that it's some 
sort of dream. Some folks from 
the coroner rang the bell at 4 a.m. 
I knew instantly when I. saw 
them there."

Campus Survives Y2K With 
Minor Problems 
GUlCH: Only a few computers needed to be reset 
By VINCENT ·GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

The UCSD campus rolled into 
the new year with only a few 
very. minor computer-related 
problems according to university 
officials. 

Clinical Engineering Senior 
Electronic Technician Richard 
Rambo said that at the UCSD 
Medical Center, everything 
went smoothly with the excep-
tion of some 486 computers that 
needed their dates and times 
reset. 

Rambo said that officials 
worked hard to make sure that 
the change from 1999 to 2000 
would come as just another ordi-
nar>,: day. . 

'There is no doubt in my 
mind that people were very dili-
gent in getting it done and get-
ting it done right," he said. 
"Things went well because we 
made sure they went well." 

He said that if computer 
glitches had not been corrected, 
there would have been many 
problems at the Medical Center. · 
For example, he said that all 
medical records, which are also 
legal documents, would have 
contained the wrong dates. 

Elazar Harel, vice chancellor 
of administrative and telecom-
munications, said that extra staff 
was on campus to ensure a 
smooth transition into the new 

year. 
"Key campus units such as the 

Medical Center, Computing, 
Telecommunications and 
Physical Plant [Services] hqd 
additional staff on hand for New 
Year 's Eve in order to verify and 
test that all services are avail-
able," he stated . 

Harel added that the universi-
ty had been working for a long 
time to ensure that there would 
not be any problems. 

"UCSD started preparing for 
Y2K over two years ago:! he stat-
ed. "The process was continuous 
and smooth and I am not aware 
of any last minute preparations 
or emergencies. H ad the proper 
steps not been taken, we would 
have definitely seen serious Y2K-
related problems. Several sys-
tems had to be upgraded in order 
to assure that problems would 
not occur and some systems had 
to be replaced." 

UCSD Crime Prevention 
Officer Alan Jenkins said that the 
UCSD Police Department did not 
see any problems on New Year 's 
Eve. 

"Absolutely nothing hap-
pened, which is what we fig-
ured," he said. 

He added that whi le the 
department did not have any 
extra people on staff, many 
employees wore pagers on ew 
Year's Eve in case their services 
were needed.

California DI&HaI LIbrary 
R ....... 'One Stop' ..... chl ... 

New features, Including a sophisticated online tool 
to simultaneously search many different scholarly 
information sources, have just been added to the 
California Digital Ubrary (COL) at the opening of its 
second year of service to the University of California 
and the public. 
• The COL, which partners with the nine UC carn-

puses in a continuing commitment to apply innovative 
technology to the management of scholarly informa-
tion, opened to the public last January. 

As a digital "c~library,' complementing the physi-
cal libraries of the UC system, the COL uses techno~ 
ogy to efficiently share materials held by UC, to pr~ 
vide greater and easier access to digital content and 
to join with researchers in developing new tools and 
innovations for scholarly communication. 

The new feature, dubbed "Searchlight,' facilitates 
·one·stop shopping· for a research topic or it can be 
used to explore resources when wonling in an unfa-
miliar subject area. 

UC faculty, students and staff can now place aut~ 
matic requests for book Md joumal artJcle delivery from 
throughout the nine-campus system by clickl'll the 
"request· button found in CDL~ted databases. 

In addition to the Searchlight tOOl, the Alexandria 
Digital Library of maps, aerial photographs, a place-
name gazetteer and other ge~spatially referenced 
information debuts here. 

Improvements to the COL's Directory of 
Collections, illCluding more than 4,800 electronic jour· 
nals, more than 50 journal article databases and 
4,000 Inventories or "finding aids· to archival collec·

4 OPINION 

STORY BY BRENT DON, 
OPINION mlTOR 

The UCSD Guardian 

New years are ripe for top 10 lists. The 
top athletes of the year, the top people of 
the year, the top events of the year; the 

m~ia goes wild at the end of the year. Well, 
thiS IS the mother of all new years, so it 
deserves nothing less than the mother of all 
top 10 lists. 

Depending on which camp of the hotly 
debated calendar issue you subscribe to, 
this is either the first year of the third mil-
lennium or the last year of the second. 
Either way, the year 2000 is a good time for 
reflection on the last 1,000 years and the 
important events that have shaped history. 
The follOWing is a list of the top 10 most 
important developments of the past 1,000 
years. Any period in history is bound to 
have an exaggerated idea of its own impor-
tance, because that is the only history con-
temporary SOCiety has had any exposure to. 
As such, I have elected to divide the list in 
half, listing five of the most important 
developments of the millennium as a 
whole, as well as five of the most important 

developm~nts of the 2~th century, in order 
to try and Isolate the bias as much as possi-
ble. 

The MIII ..... um 
1. The Crusades 

From the 11th century until the 13th cen-
tury, European Christians were induced by 
the Pope to make war on the Muslims in the 
Middle East. Long before the machines of 
modem warfare Simplified the process, vast 
armies swept across hundreds of miles, rap-
turing the cities of the "infidel" (strangely, 
the term used by both sides to refer to the 
enemy) and displacing entire populations in 

~he gu~ of religious principle. Even today 
In the Middle East and Europe li1ere remains 
a degree of animosity smoldering from these 
ancient conflicts. 

2. The End ot the Dark Ages 
From the fifth century until roughly the 

15th century a sizable portion of the 
Mediterranean world didn't accomplish a 
whole lot. The final collapse of the Roman 
Empire, the political dynamo of Europe 
during the first millennium, cast its far-
flung territories into a social and intellectu-
a l depression that took nearly a tho~sand 
years to recover from. There were no tangi-
ble forces holding civilization back, and the 
exact moment the Dark Ages ended is diffi-
cu lt to pinpoint, but the tact is that 
European SOCiety suddenly galvanized after 
nearfy a millennium of stagnation and 
e~barked upon a decidedly more progres-
sive course. 

3. The Invention of the Gun 
~unpowder was originally discovered in 

China around the ninth century, but initially 
it was used for fireworks. Around the 14th 
century, it was introduced to Europe and 
started to be used here and in Asia iJ1' 
firearms: The use of the gun by infantrymen 
moderruzed warfare, gradually reducing 
the average number of soldiers involved in 
an engagement while at the same time 

inc~asing the. amount of damage a Single 
soldier could infliCt. The gun provided an 
insurmountable advantage over nations 
that lacked the technology, allowing those 
who possessed firearms to conquer other 
civilizations with frightening speed. In 
modem times, guns have started to become 

~ore readily available to civ!lian porula-
lions, drasllcally changing the role 0 law 
enf?rcement and crime and sparking heated 
SOCIal debates about ownership and regula-
tion. 

Monday, Ianuary 10, 2000 

grown into some of the most dynamic and 
influential in the world. 
5. The Industrial Revolution 

Machination and the industrialization of 
production made many of the wonders (and 
tragedies) of the 19th and 20th centuries p0s-
sible. Industrial technologr radically 
changed the physical and socia structure of 
the n,ations it gripped. It brought \l wider 
variety of products to the masses and great-
ly increased nations' ability to wage war. It 
stratified ;tnd mobilized the workforce of 
entire natioTlS and prompted world-sweep-
ing movements like socialism and commu-
nism that sought to relieve the plight of the 
histOrically-neglected working class. Even 
today, the revolution continues as underde-
veloped countries strive to obtain the trap-
pings of industrial society. 

The Centu 
1. The Inv&ntion of The 
Automobile 

The automobile allowed populations to 
both concentrate and disperse. The incred-
ible capacity for transportation that the 
automobile afforded provided the 
resources needed to sustain ever larger 
cities, while at the same time allowing pe0-
ple to live farther and farther away from 
where they worked, giving rise to a curi-
ous phenomenon called the suburbs. It 
brought shipping to what had previously 
been remote locations and allowed these 
areas to grow into viable towns and cities. 

2. The Oil-based Economy 
Petroleum dorrunated the 20th century 

the way ~o single resource, not even gold, 
had dommated any previous period in his-
tory. It fueled the growing industry of 
natiON, brought incredible wealth to 
nations that were otherwise poor, sparked 
various conflicts and wars throughout the 
world and changed the environment with 
the massive amount of pollution its wide-
spread use created. In recent decades a 
great deal of energy has been devoted to 
developing technolOgies in the hopes that 
modem SOCiety will eventually be freed 
from its dependence on oil in the 21st cen-
tury. 

3. World War II 
Mankind's capacity for waging war 

reached new extremes during the 20th cen-
tury. This conflict raged across three conti-
nents, and approximately 60 million pe0-
ple died as a result of the war. It carried the 
horrendous idea of genocide to new levels 
of depravity, forever rearranged the maps 
of Europe, Asia and the Middle East and 
introduced the world to nuclear weapons. 
The fear of future global conflicts gave rise 
to the multi-national United Nations. In 
addition the unsettled differences between 
the two erstwhile allies the United States 
and the Soviet Union lead to the Cold War 
which would last nearly 50 years. . ' 

4. The Cold War 
Although the two superpowers of the 

20th century never fought each other direct-
ly, the diametrically opposed political views 
of the United States and the USSR lead both 
nations into armed conflicts and political 
confrontations all over the globe. Two gen-
erations grew up living in fear of nuclear 
annihilation in a war between the two 
countries. The conflict prompted an arms 
race, a space race and an imperialistic for-
eign policy that dominated each country's 
destiny and eventually bankrupted the 
USSR. 4. The Colonization of the 

Americas 
The discovery and colonization of the 

two American continents by Europeans can 
be called the last great migration in human 
history. The centuries that followed the 
arrival of the irrevocably off-target explorer 
Christopher Columbus in the Americas 
were marked by some of the greatest feats 
and some of the worst tragedies history has 
ever witnessed. The indigenous people of 
the continent were alternately conquered or 
exterminated by the arriving Europeans, 
and out of the remnants of these native peo-
ple grew nations that were a merger of the 
Old and New Worlds, nations that have 

. 5. The Invention of the Computer 
Computers have come a long way in the 

relatively short amount of time since their 
invention. They have shrunk from mam-
moth devices the size of warehouses that 
only governments and major corporations 
could afford to palm-held devices your 
average student or businessman might well 
own. They've changed the way we work, 
the way we communicate and the way we 
~lax. As the .world is gripped in the grow-
109 Information Revolution it seems clear 
that computers' influence on SOCiety has 
still only just begun.

Stereotypes Constrain Cultural Interests of Men 
COMMENTARY: Expectations of spons and beer chugging don't leave much room for diversity in our judgmental society 
By SIMONE SANn NI 
Cuntributing Writer 

God knows that I am under-
standing and sympathetic to the 
struggles of women and minori-
ties in this country (not to men-
tion the rest of the world). I real-
ize that, unfortunately, many 
women still have to fight with 
the diffuse notion that they are 
somehow not as good as men 
and with the idiotic i1ssumption 
that a short skirt or tight dress is 
an open invitation to a rape 
party. 

I sympathize with minorities 
that have been discriminated 
against, economically relegated to 
inner cities and poorer quality 
education and now are told that 
trying to compensate them for 
past discrirrunation is unfair. 

However, we all have to 
acknowledge that no hardship, 
no struggle, no denied right can 
compare with the plight of a 
white heterosexual male of aver-
age intelligence trying to live. up 
to the male stereotypes of our 
age, and it is to this very personal 
and very h~rtfelt struggle that I 
ask for your un!ierstanding. 

MARKET: 
Students can also 
get rich from stocks 
ContIIIued "... ..... 1 
of the economy can be largely 
attributed to the investments of 
the average Joes, the mom and 
pops ana the aspiring student 
entrepreneurs. We desire further 
growth, but secretly fear a crash 
or a significant loss in our invest-
ments. Secondly, we discreetly 
fear a capital gains tax of 30 per-
cent if the stock is sold in less 
than a year. 

The good thing about the 
market is that it reinvests money 
into our economy. I support 
investing in the market because 
it assists the general economy. In 
comparison, the savings and 
investment in the traditional 
banks offers little assistance to 
the business sector. Overall, I 

• would like to see more student 
investors taking risks. Use your 
financial aid money to make 
more money if you're really dar-
ing. The market provides a way 
for all of us to get rich while 
we're busy studying for 
midterms and final exams. 

ietterS@Ucsdguardilln.org 

Before I start exploring the per-
sonal issues of the matter, I ask 
you to keep in mind again that I 
am a happily married person 
and, against all the evidence that 
will come to light, I am not gay 
(not that there is anything wrong 
with it, as George Costanza, one 
of today's leading intellectuals, 
once said). 

~ First of all, I don't like sports. 
I really don' t. Never did. It some-
how percolated into my con-
sciousness that football involves 
a bunch of big guys running aim-
lessly while chasing a ball, and 
that basketball is more or less the 
same thing but on a hard court 
and with a ball of a different 
shape. My Italian ancestry 
(genetics at work?) gave me 
some intuitive understanding of 
soccer but I have to admit that, in 
this field, I am an embarrassment 
It> my people. 

It is easy to imagine how such 
a handicap can be a disaster for 
the conversational opportunities 
of a fUY in our society. In most 
socia occasions, guys seem able 
to talk about a rather limited 
range of topiCS: work - and 
talking about work goes against 

my Italian ancestry (genetics at 
work again) - or sports. Either 
way, I am out of the conversa-
tion. 

lf I t[yoto sneak into a conver-
sation the suggestion that maybe 
San Diegans were a little 
thoughtless when they decided 
to finance an extravagant . and 
incredibly expensive ballpark 
when we could have given the 
city a much needed public 
library for a fraction of the cost, 
gazes turn to ice and the conver-
sation grinds to an embarrassing 
halt . Not because of my opposi-
tion to the ballpark, but because 
of a much darker secret that my 
statement has inadvertently 
revealed. 

The fact, you see, is that I like 
to read. 

This, as you can imagine, is 
terrible, and the fact that every-
body who comes into my house 
can see that I have a large book-
case and a tiny old TV doesn't 
help to conceal the truth. The 
stereotypical "real guy" doesn't 
read anything beyond the sports 
page of the local newspaper 
(which I don't read on account of 
the little problem I mentioned 

JANUARY 2~ 

GEARY 
THOMPSON 

soft jazz 

earlier). The main obstacle to the 
happy interaction between "real" 
guys and books seems to lie, as 
far as I can tell, in the fact that it is 
hard to read while you are 
crashed on the couch with a beer 
in one hand and a bucket of 
chicken nuggets in the other. At 
the very least, tl e book would 
come out of the ordeal horribly 
stained. 

This calls to mind another 
source of embarrassment 
because, unfortunately, I am not 
much of a beer drinker. I prefer a 
nice glass of wine (damn these 
Italian genes!). Such a perversion 
deserves to be hidden, and I do 
the best I can, but it's hard. When 
I find myself at a bar and the bar-
tender asks me if I want a Bud 
Light, an answer such as"Yes, 
please, a 1988 would be fine" usu-
ally gives me away. 

I don't dare invite friends for 
dinner, for fear that they will find 
out that 1 like to cook and that we 
usually have dinner sitting at a 
dinner table - with a tablecloth 
and plates, no less. I try to force 
myself to see action movies and, 
a t home, I practice the sentence 
"Chuck Norris is a great actor" 

over and over again, but I live in 
constant fear that the tremor in 
my voice when I try to say it will 
give me away. 

It is getting harder and harder 
to hide the truth. How many 
nights did I spend listening to 
football players comment on the 
game and wondering why I found 
it to be incoherent babble instead 
of fascinating poetry like most 
other guys? How many times d id 
I try to belch without, to this day, 
succeeding? I even bought a ticket 
for a monster truck exhibition 
(although, at the last moment, I 
couldn't go through with it). 

So, I decided to write this 
appeal for all guys like me out 
there to invite them to come o ut 
of the closet. Even heterosexual 
males should be given the right 
to live according to their convic-
tions. If you don ' t want to w a tch 
the game on TV because you 
prefer the opening of the 
Magritte exhibit, just say so! If 
you prefer read ing the la test 
Sepulveda to watching the la test 
Schwarzenegger, speak out! 

It will be a difficult struggle, 
but our day will come.

"Millennium" Easily the Most 
Misused Word of the Millennium 
COMMENTARY: The miscorlception over when the inillennium really 
begins is nothing new to our society 
By KEVIN SEiD 
Staff Writer 

Perhaps the most over-used 
and· hyped-up word being 
uttered during this year's New 
Year's Eve celebrations was "mil-
lenni urn." As the calendar flipped 
from 1999 to 2000, everyvne fler-
aided the moment as the begin-
ning of the new millennium. 
Many countries put on huge, 
elaborate events, and millions of 
people around the world partied 
aU night long. 

News organizations covered 
every New Year 's Eve celebration 
across the globe. TV cameras 
darted across time zones, broad-
casting all of these celebrations 
live to a worldwide audience. 
ABC news anchor Peter Jennings 
spent more than 24 hours on the 
air nonstop while hosting the 
ABC 2000 telethon. 

What is so special about the 
year 2000? Nothing really. It 
seems that the first week of 
January 2000 was baSically the 

~me as the first week of January 
1999. Nothing out of the ordinary 
reaJly happened. The only poten-
tial threat was the Y2K bug, 
which could have made comput-
ers think that it is the year 1900 
instead of 2000. So far, however, 
nothing major has happened. 

The most alarming aspect of 
this New Year's Eve is the widely 
accepted view that the year 2000 
does mark the beginning of a new 
millennium. It seems that the 
general public is extremely 
gullible and ignorant Qf elemen-
tary math - all of those zeros in 
2000 must have gone to every-
one's heads. 

Of course, this millennium 
problem would not even be an 
issue if we adopted one of the 
other 40 calendar systems used 
around the world. It is the year 
5760 in the Jewish calendar, 1420 
in the Islamic calendar and 4678 
in the Chinese calendar. Those 
who observe these calendars 
mostly went about their business 
on Dec. 31, oblivious to the all the 
hoopla. There was no new millen-

nium for them. 
But the widely accepted calen-

dar that we use today is the 
Christian Gregorian calendar, the 
system used by many cultures 
and societies, regardless of tht,ir 
religious origins. . 

This calendar system was cre-
ated by a sixth-century Scythian 
monk named Dionysius Exiguus 
(Dennis the Short). He decided 
that the date should be reckoned 
by the birth of Jesus Christ. 

Unfortunately, Dennis the 
Short was using the Roman 
numeral system and thus did not 
know about the mathematical 
concept of zero. As a resu It, he set 
the birth of Christ at the year 
A.D. 1 The years count back-
wards befOre the birth of Christ to 

Of course) this millennium 
problem would not even be 
an issue if we adopted one 
of the other 40 calendar 
systems used around the 
world .... Granted) Dec. 31) 
1999 was still a good day to 
party. After all) it was New 
Year)s Epe. But this does not 
change the fact that 
recognizing the day as the 
end of the millennium was 
wrong. 

the year 1 B.C., then they immedi-
ately shift to A.D. 1. 

Thus, there was no year zero 
and the calendar begins at A.D. 1 
Since a millennium is 1,000 years, 
the first millennium began at the 
start of the year 1 and ended at 
the end of 1000. The second mil-
lennium then began with the year 
1001 and will conclude at the end 
of 2600. Therefore, the third mil-
lennium really begins with the 
year 2001. 

The same argument applies in 
figuring out when centuries and 
decades end and begin. The 19th 
century ended in 1900 and the 
20th century began in 1901. The 

'90s began in 1991. 
This ordering is not like a car's 

odometer. Odometers start at 
zero. When the numbers roll to 
3,000, it means that you have dri-
ven 3,000 miles. Since the calen-
dar started at 1, rolling over to the 
year 2000 just means that we have 
only completed 1,999 years 
(marking the 1,~th anniversary 
of Jesus Christ's birth). 

A lot of people are guilty of 
this millennium madness, from 
the media reporting on the end of 
the millennium to the politicians 
who planned those elaborate cel-
ebrations, from advertisers mar-
keting their millennium specials 
to the Pope himself. The whole 
idea of the end of the millennium 
was just a product of how igno-
rant our society has become. 
People are more obsessed with 
significant-looking numbers than 
real math and science. 

The most disturbing aspect of 
this problem is that it showed 
how little we have advanced dur-
ing the past 1,000 years. This 
foolishness plagued Western 
society back in the year 999 as 
well. Everybody back then 
thought that the new millennium 
began on the year 1000. Despite 
all the technological and social 
advances made thereafter, people 
still seem widely unaware of this 
fact. We can split the atom, clone 
sheep and communicate from 
any part of the globe, but we still 
cannot count to 1,000. How sad. 
Future historians will surely 
laugh at us. 

Granted, Dec. 31, 1999 wasstill 
a good day to party. After all, it 
was New Year 's Eve. But this 
does not change the fact that rec-
ognizing the day as the end of the 
millennium was wrong. 

The good news is we still have 
plenty of time to get prepared to 
welcome the coming millennium. 
The real celebrations should be 
held on Dec. 31, 2000. Let us all 
just make the events that 
occurred last New Year's Eve be a 
preview of what's to come next 
New Year's Eve.

C.A.P.E. Boycott Prompted by Concem 
Editor: 

Thank you for your editorial 
regarding my (and others') boy-
cott of C.A.P.E. ("Professors' 
Boycott of C.A.P.E. is Unfair to 
Students," Dec. 9) Even though I 
of course disagree with your 
opinion, I am happy to see the 
Guardian covering serious issues 
pertaining to our students' educa-
tion and the environment in 
which we faculty and staff work. 

Since C.A.P.E. is federally 
funded, one would assume its 
writers and editors would abide 
by federal law requiring that stu-
dents' education take place in an 
environment free from racial, sex-
ual or religious harassment. My 
perception is that many of the 
illustrations and comments pub-
lished in C.A.P.E. do not create 
that environment (I reference 
material on pages 118, 186, 128, 
192, 204, 208, 216, 278, 332, 350 
and 372), and this year I declined 
to cooperate with its services. My 
objection is not to material that 
may be vulgar or offensive (I like 
vulgarity!), but to material that 
creates a hostile environment for 
all of us to work and leam in. 

I hope .to be able to work 
more profitably with C.A.P.E. in 
the future, since I find its ser-
vices invaluable. My decision 
this year to boycott .A.P.E. is 
meant to help the publication

'Best "".W'trU'a" 
Contained Errors 

Editor: 
There seem to have been a few 

typos in a previous issue of the 
GUardian. In an article describing 
the top ten movies of all time ('The 
Best Films of the 20th Century," 
Dec. 9), "2001: A Space Odyssey," 
"The Godfather," "City Lights" 
and "Cabaret" were accidentally 
omitted, curiously replaced with 
"The Princess Bride" and 
"Tltanic." You might want to con-
sider hiring proTessional proof-
readers to ensure that these kinds 
of silly errors don't slip through 
the cracks in the future. 

Apologetically correct the mis-
takes in a future issue, and we can 
put it behind us.

Student Investors Tap 
Into the· Market Boom 
COMMENTARY: Rapid growth of stocks may 
contribute to a market crash 
By ARNR GUIANG 
Contributing Writer 

I have a 20-year-old friend that 
made over $100,000 in 1999 day 
trading. He did so well he even 
bought himself a Lincoln 
Navigator. My friends and family 
are also getting rich. Similar stories 
of relatives eaming $150,000 this 
year in the market are echoed in 
many families. The economy is 
welcoming more investment and 
is letting us down in returned gain. 

I want to be like my friend and 
buy myself a new car. Isn't the 
stock market an incredible factor 
in the well-being of our economy 
today? With all the successes that 
I've heard of, I'm utterly relieved 
that there was not a significant 
crash due to Y2K. 

With the advent of Lnternet 
trading, _ many students have 
taken advantage 

fully our investments won't send 
us into debt or a recession. 

If I were the Federal Reserve 
chair, I would immediately stag-
nate the economy. Exponential 
growth carries too much fear of a 
proportional downfall. If the Dow 
continues to climb above 11,000 
to, say, 15,000 in one year, it could 
just as easily fall to 5,000. Ouch, 
that would hurt a lot of people. It 
is better for the country as a whole 
to maintain the prosperity that we 
now enjoy and slow the overall 
growth of the economy than to 
live in fear of a crash or some 
other economic turmoil that may 
result in another recession. The 
quality of life that exists now is 
unprecedented. Sustaining this 
economic environment should be 
the priority of our Federal 
Reserve Chair. 

Americans are heavily invest-
ing in the technol-

of the prosperous 
economic trend 
and h'ave also

think of a t least

1999 was an economically suc-

went up - I can't think of a sin-

heard success stories. This period 
of time kind of reminds me of the 
"Roaring '20s," when everyone 
was prosperous due to a bullish

think we have learned our lesson

Look at Qualcomm, whose stock 
recently split after ri ing at over 
$400. I'm glad for Irwin Jacobs 
and the success his company has 
brought San Diego and our 
school of engineering. Hopefully 
Jacobs will donate another $15 
million to our school so that we 
can build a computer science

doing so well. 

My ultimate desire is to see the 
continued gradual growth of the 
economy. I think the huge growth

MEXICO: 
Flow of drugs may 
be heavier than ever 
Continued from ..... 1 
Most-Wanted list. 

But despite the most sus-
tained and costly fight ever 
waged against one of the drug 
mafias that have tormented 
Mexico, the Arellanos and their 
most important associates have 
evaded capture, emerging as 
glaring symbols of the failure of 
the American and Mexican gov-
ernments even to disrupt the 
powerful gangs that control 
Mexico's drug trade. 

Through plan after secret 
plan to combat the traffickers, 
their business has thrived. 

According to U.S. customs 
and law enforcement officials, 
the flow of drugs across this 
part of the border may now be 
heavier than ever before. 

"It's just not working," said 
Thomas A. Constantine, former 
head of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration. "We know who 
they are. We have arrest war-
rants against them. But for all 
the high-level meetings, the 
task forces, the millions of dol-
lars spent, the major figure still 
aren't arrested." 

A lengthy examination of the 
campaign against the Arellanos, 
based on intelligence reports 
from both countries and dozens 
of interviews, suggests that its 
most basic obstacle remains the 
corruption that pervades 
Mexican law enforcement. 

But despite some American 
officials' insistence that finding 

((We know who they 
are. We have arrest 
warrants against 
them. But Jor all the 
high-level meetings) the 
task forces) the mdlions 
of dollars spent) the 
major figures still 
aren)t arrested.» 

- Thomas Consuntlne 
Former head of DEA 

the Arellanos is simply a matter 
of Mexican political will, there 
is considerable evidence for the 
assertions of Mexican officials 
that the intelligence they get on 
the traffickers from the United 
States is often inaccurate or 
incomplete. 

And though American 
agents and prosecutors have 
won sealed indictments against 

West Hollywood Debates 
Condom Efforts For Bars 

WEST HOLLYWOOD 
OfficIal , health workers and 
nightclub owners have been 
arguing for months over develop-
ing a municipal policy to get the 
denizens of the freewheelmg 
night life mecca here to obtain 
and use condoms. 

On Monday, the West 
Hollywood City Council 
approved a plan to give 320,000 
free condoms this year to 33 gay 
bars, which would voluntarily 
supply the condoms to their clien-
tele by placing condoms in jars. 

But, feeling the step insuffi-
cient, the AIDS Healthcare 
Foundation, which treats 5,000 
patients throughout the Los 
Angeles area, ha proposed a 
competing initiative that would 
ask West Hollywood voters to 
make the program apply to an 
bars in the city - not just those 
with a predominantly gay clien-
tele - and would require partiCi-
pation. • , 

"It's about protecting the pub-
lic health," said Michael 
Weinstein, the foundation's presi-

ed pregnancy and other sexually 
tran mitted diseases. We' re in an 
epidemic in West Hollywood, and 
we're not doing all we can do." 

The toughe t opponents may 
be the bar patrons themselves. 

"You can put condoms'in their 
faces, but it's up to them if they 
use them," Les Kurkendaal, a 33-
year-old actor, said at the gay dis-
cotheque Revolver. "We've had 
condoms for years, but people 
still have unsafe sex." 

The debate has been about how 
extensive the program should be. 

In West 'Hollywood, where 
roughly a third of the residents-
and many more of its club and 
bar patrons - are gay men, there is 
concern over a return of promis-
cuity brought on by the success of 
protease inhibitors in treating 
HIV and AIDS, combined with a 
new generation of less careful 
men whor for. the most-part, have 
not lost friends to the disease the 
way older gay men have.

most of the Arellanos and their 
main associates, officials say the 
Clinton administration has 
done little to press Mexico City 
to join in a viable plan to appre-
hend them. 

"This is not rocket science," 
the former acting U.S. attorney 
for the Southern District of 
California, Charles G. laBella, 
said in an interview. "The 
Mexicans and the Americans 
could get these guys tomorrow 
if they really wanted to. If we 
were serious about it, we would 
pullout the stops." 

Officials say the Arellanos 
have prospered even as they 
have gone deeper underground, 
leaving the handling of their 
smuggl~ng operations and graft 
arrangements to an associate. 
At the same time, the failings of 
the campaign against them 
have grown more evident. 

But with congressional pres-
sure on the authorities rising in 
both countries, particularly 
after their largely unsuccessful 
collaboration in the recent 
search for mass graves purport-
edly left by drug traffickers in 
Ciudad Juarez, officials are 
vowing once again to step up 
their pres ure on the Tijuana

Russia Bombs Chechnya 
DUBA-YURT, Russia 

"Artillery teady?" Lt. Col. Yuri 
Budanov shouted. 

"On the planned targets!" 
"Merry Christmas!" 
A thunderous blast reverberat-

ed through this Chechen town as 
Russian artillery fined a salvo at 
rebel positions about 10 miles 
away in the snow-covened moun-
tains of southern Chechnya. 

Russia's acting president, 
Vladimir Putin, had declaned a 
halt to air and artillery strikes on 
Grozny to mark Orthodox 
Christmas and the end of 
Ramadan, the Muslim holiday. 
But there was no moratorium 
here. In fact, fighting raged in 
Chechnya's mountains and low-
lands Sunday, as both sides 
decided this was a perfect time to 
clash. 

Fierce fighting was said to be 
raging in Shali, southeast of the 
Chechen capita\. And clashes 
were reported on the outskirts 
of Gudermes, Chechnya's sec-
ond-largest city, which the 
Russians had wanted to use as 
an administrative capital for the 
Chechen territory under its con-
trol. There were shootings and 
attempted infiltration reported 
at checkpoints elsewhere in 

Chechnya. 
The southern front near Duba-

Yurt was tense, too. 
Duba-Yurt is located just north 

of the Caucasian ridge, a stun-
ning tableau of rugged moun-
tains, shrouded in mist. It is also 
the gateway to the Argun gorge: 
one of the main routes from cen-
tral Chechnya to the rebel bases 
in the mountains of southern 
Chechnya and, eventually, to 
neighboring Georgia, less than 40 
miles away. 

The Russians are trying to 
push south into the gorge and 
destroy the rebel bases on both 
sides of it. The militants are strug-
gling to move north toward 
Grozny and the lowlands, hoping 
to regain the initiative and save 
their comrades fighting in 
Grozny. 

On Saturday, militants left 
their hideouts in the mountains 
and tried to break through the 
Russian lines here. They were 
repelled, and Sunday Russian 
helicopters flew reconnaissance 
missions over the mountains, 
searching for targets for Russian 
artillery.

Cuban BOy is Political Symbol 
MIAMI - The heated politi-

cal bailIe over the custody of the 
Ix-year-old boy Elian Gonzalez 
howed no signs of subsiding 

Saturday after a HOllse 
Republican leader subpoenaed 
the boy to testify before 
Congre in an effort to keep 
him in the United Sta tes. 

The subpoena was 
announced late Friday night by 
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind ., the 
chairman of the House 
Government Reform 
Committee, hours after one of 
Elian's relatives in Miami took 
the first step toward becoming 
the boy's legal guardian. Burton, 
in his announcement, said he 
subpoenaed Elian to testify 
before his committee on Feb. 10 
so the boy can remain in the 
country while the courts con id-
er his case. ' • 

With his Miami family crying 
tears of joy behind him on 
Friday night, Elian waved the 

. subpoena, a wrinkled piece of. 
'paper, back and' forth ' on his 
front porch. At least in his fami-
ly's view, the subpoena was a 
tfmeorary reprieve.

"We hope this will protect 
him temporarily, at lea t until 
the judge is.ues an order" in 
state court, said the boy's 
lawyer, Jose Garcia-Pedrosa. 

But some Democrat called 
the subpoena a political ploy, 
saying It does not bar people

COSBY: 
Maya Angelou is 
second choice 
Continued from paC. 1 
the university's ability to pay 
Cosby's fee. According to Cosby's 
agent, the entertainer is available 
on the day of graduation and 
would charge $150,000 to speak. 

Mantell is currently in the 
process of contacting Cosby's 
management company to deter-
mine if the performer 's rate is 
negotiable. 

While no funds have been 
spent over the past three years for 
commencement speakers, Vice 
Chancellor of External Affairs Jim 
Langley has in the past approved 
up to $50,000 fees for graduation 
speakers. 

In the event that Cosby's ser-
vices cannot be procured, Mantell 
said that he and the A.S. Council 
would have to rethink the seiec-
tion. 

"I would have to go back to 
council and get its opinion," 
Mantell said. 

Currently, Maya Angelou is 
the AS. Council's second choice. 

"She is one of the most charis-
.matic people 1 have ever met," 
Mantell said. "It is very powerful 
to hear her in her own voice." 

One potential problem with 

Angelou's participation in com-
mencement exercises is overexpo-
sure. She will be speaking at San 
Diego State University in March 
and she spoke at RIMAC Arena 
last February. 

After selling 4,700 tickets to 
Angelou's appearance at RIMAe, 
however, b4antell said he is confi-
dent that if she speaks at gradua-
tion, the ceremony will be well-
attended. 

"Everyone who saw her last 
year will want to hear her again," 
Mantell said. 

If both Cosby and Angelou are 
unavailable, the A.S. Council will 
consider a second tier of speak-
ers. 

"Most of these speakers would 
deliver a quality speech althou~ 
they might not be as well-
known," Mantell said. 
"Hoeefully, this will not happen, 
but If it does we'll move on and 
find someone else." 

Due to the distinguished 
nature of the speakers over the 
last three years, Mantell noted the 
importance of a quality presenter. 
"We need to have a strong speak-
er," he said. 

Three years ago, President 
Clinton contacted UCSD to offer 
his services as a guest speaker. 

As a result of Clinton's 
appearance, Chancellor Robert 
Dynes implemented a three-year 
trial for the all-campus com-

mencement. 
The year after Clinton spoke, 

former Republican Speaker of the 
House Newt Gingrich delivered a 
commencement address amidst 
much controversy. 

"Gingrich speaking was very 
controversial with rallies and 
threats of walkouts," Mantell 
said. "However, things went 
smoothly." 

Gingrich's speech was not as 
well-attended as Clinton's 
appearance. 
. The trend toward decreasing 

attendance at graduation contin-
ued last year when Irwin Jacobs, 
former UCSD engineering profes-
sor and current CEO of 
Qualcomm, was the guest speak-
er. 

The three-year trial of the all-
campus commencement is now 
completed. 

Dynes has decided to contin-
ue with the current commence-
ment arrangement but has 
reserved the right to return to 
the practice of only having indi-
vidual college commencements. 

Regardless of the actual com-
mencement structure, Mantell 
said that the needs of the seniors 
who are graduating will be the 
top priority . • 

"For the seniors who are grad-
uating this will hopefully ensure 
a positive memory of their last 
day of school," Mantell said. 

MEMORY: 
Rats taught to swim

Previous studies done by 
Lai have shown that when 
achetylcholine cells become 
overly damaged by 
microwaves they will die. 
Alzheimer's Disease is an 
example of achetylcholine cell '

Lai explained that the 
amount of energy absorbed

factor in damage. 

In this study, rats were 
exposed for one hour to 
microwave radiation prior to 
training sessions, where the rats 
were taught to swim to an 
underwater platform in cloud-
ed water. 

The six training sessions 
were more effective with the 
unexposed rats, who overall 
were more likely to find the 
platform than the irradiated 
rats. 

Lai said that this could be 
indicative of microwaves caus-

Find 37 New Kinds of

STANFORD, Calif.-
People may believe that their 
mouths are pristine after a 
good brushing and flossing. 
But the truth is that the human 
mouth is home to so many • 
microbes that,some 
researchers compare it to a 
rain forest for the diversity of 
life and vast territory yet to be 
explored. 

A study by ~nford 
researchers supports this anal-
ogy by identifYing 37 new 
kfrids of bacteria thriving 
between the teeth and gums. 
The research brings the total 
known species of oral wildlife 
to about SOO, some of which 
are permanent residents, while 
others may just be passing 
through. 

Knowing more about the 
bacteria that reside in a normal, 
healthy mouth may help physi-
cians understand changes in 
the bacterial population that

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
The Freshman Blues: One quarter down) two more to go 

JOSH CROUSE 
As ociate Features Editor 

Freshman year in college is a 
special time in everyone's life. 
You're away from home for the 
first time. You're finally unsuper-
vised. There are thousands of 
new peo?le to meet and to 
become the best of friends with. 
It 's a time when you make those' 
fuzzy memories that will last you 
a lifetime. Yeah, right! I haven't 
heard such a fat load of crap since 
our dear president declared that 
he never had "sexual relations" 
with his kneepad-toting intern. 

I haven't been here for three 
months and I already know what 
most students take a few years to 
really grasp. Freshman year really 
sucks. Some people don't realize it 
until sophomore or junior year. 
Maybe theY/'ust needed to experi-
ence upperc assman life to appre-
date the crap they went through as 
freshmen, or maybe they were just 
in deep denial. That would explain 
the silly grins and blank expres-
sions. In any case, I'm one of the 
few who noticed the problems of 
freshman year right off the bat. 

Alright, I'll grant you that Wel-
come Week didn't suck ... that 
badly My initial anxiety about 
living with seven strangers was 
relieved the moment I met my 

uitemates. We clicked right off 
the bat and spent the first week 
staying up until dawn doing 
whatever we wanted. We met a 
lot of cool people, even a few hot 
girls (you know who you are. 
And by the way, why haven't you 
called?). Even the food was edi-
ble the first week. In general, life 
was pretty good. 

Then classes started, and the 
euphoria wore off. Quickly. I was 
suddenly reminded of why I could-
n't wait to get out of high school. It 
was illJ of the work. I thought that 
college would be a breeze with only 
four classes a quarter - piece of 
cake! Not. I was swamped with 
work from the beginning. There 

Thursday classes began, I 
embarked on an endles trip to 
the salad and pasta bars - any-
thing to stay away from the 
frightening main course that the 
chef had thrown together. Every 
once in a while, I would conjure 
up some courage and venture 
over to the "special" of the day. A 
few times I actually ordered it. I 
think I must have been delirious 
from studying. Once, I made the 
mistake of ordering the T-bone 
steak. A charred chunk of animal 
(I'm still not sure what kind) 
slapped on a plate with beans and 
com on the cob for a mere $10. 
That was a mistake. 

Which brings me to yet another 

souls tha~ underestimated their 
appetites and ran out of meal 
points a few months before the end 
of the quarter. Some of them fruit-
lessly try to stretch their points by 
eating one meal a day, which con-
sists of a muffin, but that 
inevitably fails and they starve. 

How about the dating life at 
college? That has to be good, 
right? Wrong again. Remember, 
this is freshman year. Everything 
is agonizing. Trying to find a date 
in college is like trying to find the 
Pope at a Rob Zombie concert. He 
just isn't there. Any decent-look-
ing girl is either attac,hed to a pre-
med student or is "taking a break 
from boys." In any case, they want 

Trying to find a date in college is like trying to find the pope at a Rob Zombie 
concert. He just isn)t there. Any decent-loofi'jAgirl is either attached to a pre-
med student or is «taking a break from boys. In any case) they want nothing to 
do with freshmen guys. 
wasn't that one-week grace period 
that high school teachers give you 
to get to know your classmates and 
introduce the course. It was just 
work from day one, and it sucked. 
Really badly. Suddenly, I was stuck 
at home instead of being out every 
night. Late nights of conversation 
and television with my suitemates 
turned into sleepless nights of 
homework. 

Then there was the food . I'm 
not quite sure what it was, maybe 
it was the classes, or maybe it was 
the fact that my tastebuds were 
reawakening, but the food really 
started to become inedible once 
classes began. It was an overnight 
phenomenon. Wednesday night, 
the food was fine. However, once 

downfall of freshman year Oust 
wait, more are on the way). You 
guessed it, I'm talking about the 
meal points. When it comes to 
meal points, there are only two 
kinds of people, the haves and the 
have:-nots. Don't try to kid your-
self, nobody has a meal plan that 
suits them perfectly in the first 
quarter of freshman year. The 
haves are very easy to spot. 
They're the ones at Earl's Place 
buying eight lava lamps and five 
black Tights because they're a few 
hundred points over the number 
of points that they're supposed to 
be at. The have-nots are not so easy 
\0 find - mostly because they're 
skinnier than an Ethiopian, and 
just as hungry. These are the poor 

nothing to do with freshmen guys. 
In these darkest of times, who 

can humbled freshmen look to for 
guidance and support? Upper 
ciassmen, who have survived the 
horrors of the first year of college 
and understand their pai(l? Think 
again. Most upperclassmen laugh 
at hopelessly lost freshmen. I 
think it's one of their favorite past 
times: They think back to their 
freshman year and remember 
that no upperclassmen helped 
them out, so they feel that they 
3re returning the favor by spum-
ing the new freshmen crop. You 
insensitive pricks! 

With all of the fun to be had on 
campus, it'S a wonder why any 
freshman would ever want to 

leave. As hard as it might be for 
them, some Freshmen pry them-
selves away on the weekends to 
try to alleviate some of the stress 
that their calculus midterms 
cause. However, going out as a 
freshman can almost suck as 
badly as staying on campus. 
Relax, I said "almost." 

Bu t the fact remains fha t fresh-
men are broke and under 21, leav-
ing only one true option. Viva la 
Mexico! The problem is getting 
there. Most freshmen are naive 
and fail to bring cars, foolishly 
believing that "public transporta-
tion is all that's needed ." The only 
remaining options are to either 
sell your kidney for a cab ride 
down (they're unbelievably 
expensive, trust me), or to steal 
your roommate's car once he falls 
asleep. I recommend the latter. 
Less expensive. Once in Mexico, 
I'll concede that you can have a 
good time. However, I'll have to 
make a distinction between hav-
ing a good time i good 01' TJ and 
having a good time during your 
freshman year. Don't you think 
that if you have to leave the coun-
try to have a good time, some-
thing is wrong? 

To all of you freshmen for 
whom this article has opened your 
naive eyes to the horrors of fresh-
man year, I'm sorry. Just take 
solace in the fact that it does get 
better. You will get food. You will 
get more money. You will get a car. 
And, God willing, you will get a 
date. Just grit your teeth and claw 
your way through this year. Go 
ahead and let yourself smile at the 
fact that you will soon get to watch 
a new batch of kids tackle their 
own freshman years. Suckprs!

Thousands Attend Sun 
God Festival 
By Jennifer GrMy 

Despite cloudy weather, UCSD's annual celebration of its unofficial

which spanned from Thursday to Saturday, featured performances in 
the Price Center, booths across campus and a four-act concert at 
RIMAC field. . 

A.5. Festivals coordinator Zach Beebee said an estimated 10,000 to 
12,000 students attended the Friday-evening festivities, which featured 
the bands Cypress Hill, Reel Big Fish, Black-eyed Peas and UCSD's 
ow n Pimp Symphony. 

"We couldn't have asked for a better balance," Beebee said. "Each 
set had a different aspect. With the additional funding we received this 
year, we were able to hire four bands instead of the traditional three."

GEMINI 
May21 - june21 

Watch and listen on Monday and 
Tuesday. You might find a more 
effective way to save money - and 
at a greater profit. You'll feel more 
like playing and less like budgeting 
from Wednesday through Friday. 
Take care you don't disperse your 
legacy before you get itl If you get 
too reckless with your money, you're 
liable to suffer a bad case of 
buyer's remorse over the weekend. 
Wait until then to shop, and your 
chances of making a wise choice 
are much better. 

LEO 
july 23 - AUg. 22 

You have more than too much 
work this week. But, you ~uld earn 
IT.ore than mere money. Tou're also 
logging points from the great 
Impression you 're making. You 're 
less interested In working from 
Wednesday through Friday. If you 
could take off on a jaunt with your 
friends, you WOUld. That might not 
be the best thing to do. Take care. 
Unfortunately, the weekend's even 
worse for travel. An older person, 
possibly your parent, has a job for 
you. Don 't fight the Inevitable; 
reschedule your outing for later. 

VIRGO 
Aug. 23 - Sept. 22 

Follow your partner's advice on 
Mond~ and Tuesday, even if it 
seems a tad unreasonable. You're 
still the practical one, of course, but 
an outrageous scheme could work. 
From Wednesday through Friday you 
may feel slightly stressed about 
money. Reassure yourself, and your 
loved ones, that there's plenty more 
where that came from. You 're liable 
to come up with a new idea as soon 
as this weekend. Venture a little fur· 
ther out than usual; that's where 
you're liable to find it. 

LIBRA 
Sept. 23 - Oct. 22 

Keep busy on Monday and Tues-
day by being creative. Don't ask for. 
directions; just get the general idea 
and go from there. You may come up 
with something better than any--
body's ever done before. From 
Wednesday through Friday, you'll 
appreciate having a bold partner. If 
he or she wants to order you around, 
don't be surprised if you love it. This 
weekend wilt be good for shopping 
with somebody else's money. Be the 
charming one and let somebody else 
write the checks. 

SCORPIO 
Oct. 24 - Nov. 2 1 

Monday and Tuesday are your 
best days all week for a romantic 
encounter. Set up your schedule 
accordingly. Allow yourself plenty of 
time so you can totally relax. You 'll 
need to rest up for the work that's 
coming later this week. From 
Wednesday through Friday, you'll 
barely have time for lunch, let alone 
a dinner date. You'll have more time 
to socialize over the weekend. You 
may feel like making .a commitment 
then, too. Take care; it'll last. 

SAGITTARIUS 
Nov. 22 - Dec. 21 

Buy some nice things for your 
home on Monday and Tuesday. You 
can also save money by fixing some-
thing yourself. You 're in the mood 
for fun and games from Wednesday 
through Friday. Don't bet more than 
you can afford to lose, though. 
You 're luckier with love than with 
money. You may be able to get 
some good work done over the 
weekend. Try new skills that you're 
learning and be patient. Practice 
makes perfect.

26 SPORTS 

ROCKER: 
Bigots have no 
place in baseball 
ContI ....... from ...,. 28 
deserves to be forgiven. 

I compietelr. disagree with 
this. First of al , Rocker was not 
criminally insane when he was 
saying these things. Not only was 
he aware of what he was saying, 
but he was also saying them to a 
Sports lIIlIstrated reporter. It 
almost seems as if he was trying 
to cause this drama. 

I like the law profe ion, '\l1d 
in law there is this thing called 
precedent. And here, I think we 
should follow precedent. 

A while back, Roy Campanella 
was kicked out of baseball for 
making di paraging remarks 
abou t African Americans. Only a 
few yea rs ago the power that be 
in baseball made Marge Schott 
sell her controlling interest in the 
Cincinnati Reds because she basi-
cally said that Hitler was a pretty 
cool guy. 

As far as I am concerned, 
Rocker's comments are ju t as bad 
as - if not worse than - those of 
the people r mentioned above. I 
don' t see how he can be allowed to 
stay in baseball after damaging the 
game in such a way. 

Moreover, I don't even know 
why the Braves would wa nt him 
back. Among other things, the 
Braves have quite a few African 
American player , and you 
know they aren' t going to be 
happy when they see Rocker in 
spring training. Also, they have 
Kerry Lightenburg - their true 
closer - coming back next year 
and thus won' t even need 

• 

Rocker to do the job he did last 
year. 

Rocker was merely a stand-in 
for Lightenburg last year and he 
did such a good job that everyone 
seems to forget that Lightenburg 
was one of baseball's best closers 
the year before. The Braves 
would be just fine without 
Rocker, and the morale in their 
locker room would obviously be 
greatly improved. Thi decision 
seems like a no-briliner to me. 

Admittedly, Rocker IS a phe-
nomenal talent. He can th row a 
baseball harder than almost any 
other player. Although this is 
true, I befieve that baseball and 
the Braves organization should 
take a moral stand liere. We are 
now in the 21st centu ry (well, we 
really aren' t yet but si nce every-
one persists we are I will ju t go 
along with them). Comments 
such as those said by Rocker went 
out of vogue 30 years ago and 
they weren't even appropriate 
then. 

We are at a very critical time in 
our search for eq uality amongst 
all members of society. Many peo-
ple are beginning to accept that 
everyone should be blessed with 
the same inalienable rights, a 
belief that this country was 
founded on. Many others are still 
stuck back in the days of segrega-
tion and racism. We need to send 
a message that this philosophy i 
no longer tolerated and sports is 
as good a place to start it as any-
where. 

The only resolution is to send 
Rocker back to his home and have 
him moan to his family about 
how the white man is losing 
power in this country. 
Meanwhile, baseball will be bet-
ter off without him.

McGihon is pleased with how

Again it was Russ' perfor-
mance that led the game as he 
scored 24 pOints and garnered 

"We lack speed and depth," 
he said. "We'lf play well against 
good teams but we don't shoot 
well against teams we should 
beat. We need to control the ball 
and play hard. 

The Tritons have a big lull 
between 'games during which 
they will attempt to get back 
on the winning track. They 
don' t play again until Jan. 23, 
when they travel to face UC 
Santa Cruz.

Braves Closer Is 
Off His Rocker 

Welcome back all! I hope 
that you all had as much of an 
unproductive winter break as I 
did. After averaging 12- hours 
of sleep and a 12-pack of beer 
a night, I am once again ready 
to face the horrors that await 
us in UCSD's lecture halls. 

As I considered what to 
write about in this column, I 
discovered that due fo the 
three-week layoff, I have an 
inordinate amount of topics to 
chose from. 

Over the break, we saw the 
Lakers go on a 14-game win-
ning streak. I was really excit-
ed about the notion of the 
Lakers returning to the days of 
Show time with Magic and 
Kareem. Then I remembered 
that I couldn't care less about 
the NBA. ix that idea. 

I also saw a couple of great 
college football games, namely 
the Fiesta and Sugar Bowls. As 
much fun as it would be to tell 
you all how much of a genius I 
was to choose Florida State to 
win it all at the beginning of 
the year, I decided there were 
more pressing matters to dis-
cuss. 

I even decided to pass up 
the unbelievable finish in 
Saturday'S playoff game fea-
turing the Titans and the Bills. 
There is very little then I enjoy 
more than a last second return 
for a touchdown to win a play-
off game. This was one of the 
most exciting events I have 
seen in sports in a long time, 
but I still think one occurrence 
carried more importance. 

Of course I am referring to 
the ever-so-insi&htful com-
ments of everyone's favorite 
bigot: John Rocker. 

Just in case you missed this 
moron's rant over the break, I 
will give you a small taste of 
his comments. This hick said 
he felt sorry for people tTom 

ew York because they 
always have to ride the sub-
way next to "a queer with 
AIDS." He also commented on 
how despicable New York is 
because of the city's diversity, 
asking questions such as why 
minorities came to this coun-
try. Perhaps Rocker 's most dis-
turbing moment in the public 
eye came when he labeled an 
undisclosed African American 
teammate a "fat monkey." 

Obviously I have missed 
something. All this time, I 
have been taught that diversi-
ty is what makes this country 
great - that freedom to live 
and believe as you please is an 

at~ribute of our nation, not a 
fallback. Obviously, Rocker's 
education deep in the heart of 
Georgia lacked this training. 

Maybe we are lucky 
because we live in California, a 
place where diversity is more 
or less accepted and cherished. 
Georgia might not have these 
attributes. 

Regardless, Rocker 's com-
ments are inexcusable. Man,>' 
people have come to Rocker s 
aid, saying he has shown 
remorse for what he said and

Women Go 7·1 Over Holidays 
DOMINATION: Tritons improve their record to 14-4 despite injuries to three starters and one reserve 
By ROBERT RJLTON 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball team had a 
very happy holiday as it accumulated many 
hard-earned presents under its tree - the 
Tritons won seven games while dropping 
onlyone. 

It was not an easy route for the 
Tritons, as vacation came 
early for four players 
due to injuries. In addi-
tion, academic problems 
affected a few freshmen . 

" Ouring that time, we lost three 
starters to injuries," UCSD Head Coach 
Judy Malone said. "We also lost two fresh-
men to eligibility problems, but they should 
be back. During the last three games, we only 
dressed eight players." 

Kate Turnbull, Marci Ernsberger, Ashley 
Kokjohn and Kim Neal were all injured . 

Turnbull has recovered and played some 
against Occidental and will see increasingly 
more action. Kokjohn is already back in action 
while Ernsberger will begin to practice on 
Monday and eal should return to the hard-
wood soon, as well. 

Injuries are always detrimental to a team, 
but UCSD showed its grit as it held together 
to post seven wins in eight games. 

"Everybody stepped it up," Malone said. 
"The kids got a chance to play. It got their con-
fidence up. It's fun to see the kids step up and 
work hard. Some of the freshmen said we 
may be better because of the injuries, because 
it gives everybody a chance." 

The Tritons basked in the comfort of home, 
playing six straight games on campus. 

UCSD made full use of its home-court 
advantage, squeaking by Christian Heritage 
University 63-57 and downing Vanguard 70-
53. Genevieve Ruvald scored 17 against 
Christian Heritage and teammate Natalie 
Beaver unloaded for 31 against Vanguard. 

After the two earlier victories, the Tritons 
hosted the UC San Diego Doubletree 

Invitational, posting a second-place finish . 
The Tritons began the tourney by downing 

Marian 87-58 and the University of Puget 
Sound 57-35 before running into trouble 
against Scranton University. 

Despite boasting four players in double-
digit scoring figures and a 25-19 half-time lead, 

the Tritons could not hold on and fell to 
Scranton 74-62 to settle for second place. 

UCSD players did garner two 
spots on the all-tourna-
ment team, with Ruvald 
and Nichole Bromley 
taking the honors. 

Ruvald scored 37 points and 
grabbed 24 rebounds for the team 

while teammate Bromley scored 32 and 
grabbed 17 boards during the tournament. 

The tournament's Most Valuable Player 
was the Scranton's Kelly Halpin. 

The Tritons rebounded after the tourna-
ment loss and took their wrath out on their 
next three opponents. 

UCSD rocked University of La Verne 84-34 
and Worcester State College of Massachusetts 
85-36. 

The power of the Tritons really came out 
against Occidental this past Friday at home as 
they won 89-32 behind 18 points from Mindy 
Misawa and 10 rebounds by Renee Hudec. 

The Tritons used their run over the holiday 
to rebound from a ho-hum 4-3 start. 

"We had some tough games," Malone said. 
"We have a tough schedule going into the sea-
son every year. I schedule it that way to get up 
the leveJ of play. Our only upset came against 
Claremont. Every year we play tough compe-
tition from the start. It takes time to get lead-
ership" 

Malone predicts that the Tritons will con-
tinue their winning ways. 

"We're playing well," he said. "Our play is 
tremendous. We're scoring. Our team is very 
quick. It is quicker than most tearns and also 
more well rounded." 

The Tritons next head into action on Friday 
when they host Chapman University at 7 p.m. 

Men Suffer from 
Winter Break Blues 
DISAPPOINTMENT: Team goes 1-9 during the 
holidays and lose one player to eligibility 
By ROBERT RJLTON 
Staff Writer 

While many UCSD students 
headed home to enjoy time with 
family and friends during the 
holiday season, the UCSD men's 
basketball team was paid a visit 
by the Grinch. 

No, not the Grinch who stole 
Christmas, but the Grinch who 
stole victories. 

The Tritons had an 
awful winter break, los-
ing nine of 10 
games to lower 
their record to a 
dismal 4-14. 

In addition to 
the losing binge, the 
Tritons suffered setbacks 
on their roster as well, with play-
ers Michael Martin and Clark 
Goolsby deemed ineligible for 
academic purposes. Martin is 
gone and Goolsby'S fate is still 
pending. 

well," Dillon said. 
With victories coming at a pre-

mium and players in trouble, the 
sparse high points for the Tritons 
were linked to the performanCes 
of starting center Ahmad Russ, 
who had a number of stellar 
games during the run. 

The general misery, however, 
began against Christian Heritage 
College as UCSD played this 
opponent on consecutive 

Saturdays, first in El Cajon 
and then at home. 

Neither game 
was impressive 
as the Tri tons lost 
the first 94-80 and 
the second 88-70. 

Sam Higgins and 
Goolsby each scored 20 points 

while Russ chipped in with 19 in 
the. first game. the second game 
featured Goolsby with 19 points 
and seven rebounds. 

The lone highlight during this 
stretch came while the team was 
on the road against University of 
La Verne. 

Led by 16 points from both 
Sam Higgins and Nick 
Christensen, UCSD won 82-16.
