AMMAN, jordan - Not long

quick trip abroad, to Vermont, to 
serve as best man at the wedding 
of a Deerfield Academy c!,\<;s-

But in another reminder of his 
new role as a pivotal player in the 
high-wire world of Middle 
Eastern peacemaking, his 
autumn weekend in New 
England soon blossomed into an 
official visit to the United States, 
his second in just five months. 

Wednesday afternoon, accom-

Elderly Drug Use 
I1UDY: UCSD researchers forecast increased substance abuse among elderly 
By LILY KORMAN 
Staff Writer 

Substance abuse in the 
elderly population is expected 
to increase as the "baby 
boomer" generation grows 
older, according to a paper by 
UCSD School of Medicine and 
Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego 
Healthcare System researchers . 

Increased drug use among 

people over age 65 is expected 
to impact treatment programs 
and other resources not geared 
to address the special needs of 
this age group. 

The review of published 
data appeared in the September 
issue of Psrcl'iatric Services, a 
journal 0 the American 
Psychiatric Association. 

The review was conducted 
by Thomas Patterson, professor 

of psychiatry at UCSD School 
of Medicine and research psy-
chologist with the VA San 
Diego Healthcare System, and 
Dilip jeste, professor of psychi-
atry at UCSD School of 
Medicine and the VA San Diego 
Healthcare System.

Triton 
Taxi 
Takes Off 
SAFETY: New program 
will offer students rides 
on weekend nights 
By JENNIFER KAPlAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Triton Taxi pro-
gram, which offers students free 
and safe rides on Friday and 
Saturday nights, will begin this 
weekend . • 

The program was approved by 
the A.S. Council in June. 

Roosevelt sophomore and 
director of ·the Triton Taxi pro-
gram Matt Conroy said he feels 
the program will provide stu-
dents with the opportunity to act 
more safely . 

"Students need to act respon-
sibly and avoid dangerous situa-
tions," he said. "Triton Taxi offers 
students an option to increase 
their own safety." 

The taxis will run on Friday 
and Saturday nights between the 
hours of 9 p .m. and 3 a.m. The 
service will be available to all 
UCSD undergraduate studenls 
bearing student I.D.s with the 
Triton Taxi sticker, obtainable at 
the reception office on the third 
floor of the Price Center. 

Conroy and A.S. President 
Tesh Khullar both said that it is 
absolutely essential 'for students 
to have the sticker. Without it, 
they will not be given a ride due 
to liability issues.

5,000 Teenagers Try Smoking Each Day 
HEALTH: New UCSD study finds that the number of youths lighting up is higher than previously thought 
By JANE KIM 
Guardian Reporter 

A recent study by the UCSD 
Cancer Center stated that the 
problem of adolescent smoking 
is more serious than most people 
think. 

Approximately 10 years ago, 
john Pierce, professor of cancer 
prevention, estimated that in the 

United States, 3,000 teenagers 
become smokers each day. This 

. finding was publi~hed in the 
/o"rual of 'lie Americall Medical 
Associatioll (lAMA) and was 
widely accepted by people all 
over the country. Tobacco com-
panies questioned the validity of 
this figure and denied its vafidi-
ty. 

In order to update and thor-

oughly examine the estimate, the 
new study was based on 1989 
and 1993 national telephone sur-
veys, titled "Teenage Attitudes 
and Practices Surveys" (TAPS) 
and the 1992 and 1993 Current 
Population Surveys (CPS), said 
assistant professor for the 
Department of Family and 
Preventive Medicine Won Choi. 
The National Cancer Institute 

(NCI) funded the research. 
The report, titled "How Many 

Adolescents Start Smoking Each 
Day in the United States?" and 
written by Elizabeth Gilpin, Won 
Choi, Charles Berry and john 
Pierce of UCSD's Department of 
Family and Preventive Medicine 
was published in the October

Galbraith Renovation Changes Course 
PUNS: Undergraduate library, with the help of ACS, will become a 'multi-media research facility' 
By JEFFREY M. BARKER 
Senior Staff Writer 

Galbraith Hall's two-year-
long facelift has changed course 
in the middle of surgery. 

While Psychological and 
Counseling Services, the theater 
and dance department and 
Revelle Writing are looking for-
ward to returning to their build-

ing in winter break 2000, the 
undergraduate library staff will 
not lug volumes of research 
materials back across campus. 

Instead, what was once 
UCSO's undergraduate library 
will become an entirely comput-
er-oriented multi-media research 
facility when it reopens fall 2000. 

Undergraduate library staff 
forged a partnership with 

Academic Computing Services 
(ACS) that will place approxi-
mately 130 computers in the ren-
ovated Galbraith Hall. All library 
resources, as well as e-mail, class 
web pages and Studentlink will 
be accessible through . the com-
puter workstations. 

"This will be pretty unique in 
the UC system," said Kari Lucas, 
head of the undergraduate 

library. 
Lucas is coordinating the 

reinvention of the undergradu-
ate library, which will no longer 
use that name. 

She has adopted many ideas 
from UCLA's College Library 
Instructional Computing 
Commons (CLlCe) web space.

Conroy and Khullar added 
that students will only be permit-

will provide the rides with a

and will cover the areas of La

he said. "All students can use a

"Baby-boomers historically 
have used more drugs than their 
predecessors." Patterson stated in 
a press releate last month. 

"While data measuring illicit 
drug use among younger baby 
boomers compiled in past 
decades show a steady drop in 
use up to age 30, it then levels out

stated. "This suggests that in

he foresees is that the program

UCAB Implements Online 
Voting to Increa.e Turnout 

Every year, a slim minority of students decides the 
fate of countless referenda and the makeup of the 
AS. Council. It was long accepted as fact that stu-
dents are apathetic to campus politics. Last spring, 
however, a fee referendum to expand the university 
centers failed at the ballot box. While voters were in 
favor of the fee hike, not enough students voted, and 
thus the measure died. 

This fall, however, the University Centers 
Advisory Board (UCAB) resurrected the measure. In 
an upcoming vote, students will no longer be limited 
to on-campus polling places. Instead, any computer 
with Internet access will serve as a polling place. And 
for those who prefer to vote on Library Walk, com-
puters will be set up in the traditional polling places. 

The Guardian applauds UCAB for encouraging 
student participation in an important decision that 
will affect the future of the university; if students will 
not come to vote, let the voting come to them. 

We also hope that the AS. Council adopts this pro-
cedure for its elections in spring. Other universities 
that have switched to online voting have seen a rise 
in voter turnout. Increased participation in the elec-
tions processes at UCSD will result in an AS. Council 
that better represents the wishes of the students. 

The Guardian urges the AS. Council to follow the 
lead of UCAB and universities across the nation by 
embracing new technology to improve the democra-
tic process 

UCSD Offers Business 
Certificate for Students 

UCSD students wishing to pursue a business 
career have been monumentally helped by the cre-
ation of the Undergraduate Certificate in Business. 
The program, which is a joint venture between 
UCSD Extension and Academic and Student Affairs, 
will give students much-valued practical experience 
before entering the job market. 

The certificate program is partly in response to a 
1998 survey of local employers and UCSD graduates, 
which found that although UCSD students excel acad-
emically in the work force, they have few practical 
skills that can be applied to solving business problems. 

Many students graduate from UCSD with superi-
or knowledge of isolated academic topics. Although 
they can carefully analyze political theory, they don't 
know the first thing about business, marketing, pub-
lishing or other practical topics. 

It is critical for UCSD students to be able to get 
jobs in San Diego after graduation. As it stands, San 
Diego State University and University of San Diego 
students sometimes beat out UCSD students for 
practical jobs. UCSD is clearly the best university in 
San Diego and our graduates need to reflect this fact. 

As a result, we urge UCSD to continue to create 
partnerships with the outside community, which 
will help the university determine how to make 
UCSD students more marketable.

STUDENT-RUN STORES 
OFFER VALUABLE EXPERIENCE 
COMMENTARY: 
Cooperatives give 
members a chance to 
share responsibilities 
By HANNAH GRIFFITH 
SraffWriter 

With a plethora of organizations, 
sports teams, greeks, and college 
activities boards clamoring for atten-
tion, it is no wonder that the uniniti-
ated often overlook the opportuni-
ties offered by the cooperatives on 
campus. 

The competition for student 
attention between on-campus activi-
ties leads to promises of "Free food!" 
from college councils, religious 
groups, and campus papers alike. 
Students are promised rewards, both 
social and sweet, just for showing up 
to a given activity, be it an "ice-cream 
social" study break, a barbecue or a 
dance. 

Instead of taking the initiative, 
students become consumers whose 
"business" is courted by the various 
groups, teams and organizations. 
This is not to say that these entities 
should stop advertising their exis-
tence or that s tuden ts shouldn't 
experiment until they find some-
thing they like. However, the exces-
sive ad vertbing often lead to low-
commitment, as well as laziness in 
searching for activities. 

At first glance the non-confronia-
tiona I message of the co-ops is not as 
appealing to students as many other 
groups' publicity messages. They see 
Groundwork Books, The Food Co-
op, the General Store Co-op, and the 
Che Cafe simply as places to get text-
books, bagels, school supplies, and 
vegetarian food at slightly lower 
prices than elsewhere on campus. 
They are unaware of the other 
opportunities offered by these enti-
ties. 

A far cry from the aggressive 
advertising of other groups, the ro-
ops' message of "Colfle work with 
us!" !oeems unpromising. Let us take 
the Food Co-op as a case in point. 

"What's this?" The new student 
may declare upon seeing the offer of 
the Food Co-op. "They want us to 
work ... and all we get in return is a 
lousy discount? No free stuff?" Most 
people just walk on by. 

This is too bad, because they are 
missing more than just a chance to 
meet new people in the context of 
common responsibility and some 
cheap food. This responsibility goes 
beyond the common - though 
important - sense of responsibility 
felt among teammates, for example. 
It is the responsibility of running a 
business. M~re specifically, a not-
for-profit, quirky, collectively-owned 
business. 

The Food Co-op is a unique busi-
ness for several reasons. First, it is 
non-traditional. Second, the glue 
holding it together is human rela-
tions and personal trust. Because 
there are no bosses, managers, or 
other hierarchy, each individual is 

. motivated by a sense of both respon-
sibility and independence to do the 
best they can. Third, it is constantly 
evolving as -members come, leave 
their mark and depart. 

This means that the only way to 
really get to know the Food Co-op is 
by knowing it's members, current 
and past. Though there are, of 
course, guiding principles and a con-
stitution, the people who work and 
volunteer there at any given moment 
are what give Food Co-op it's life. 
Over the years, different members 
have created different projects, have 
picked different causes to educate 

people about (through the Food Co-
op) and have even brought in differ-
ent types of music to play while 
working. 

It is common knowledge that dif-
ferent people have different 
strengths and talents. A co-op rec-
ognizes this by not assigning 
responsibilities to people, but rather 
letting them volunteer for what 
they feel comfortable with. "Does 
stuff get done?" one may ask. The 
answer is yes, ninety-five percent of 
the time. 

People are there because they 
want to be. They take out the trash, 
wipe off the counter, re-stock the 
dried mango or call a.delivery com-
pany- not because someone tells 
them to, but because. they see that it 
needs to be done, and that other pe0-
ple depend on them to do it (and trust 
that they will). The other side of this 
is that J:oocI Co-op members know 
the other 5 percent of the time when 
they forget, run out of time, don't 
know how to finish or for whatever 
reason don't do something that some-
one has got their back 

One last, very important thing 
about the co-ops that keeps people 
committed to them is that each 
individual sees the fruit of their 
labor. Experiencing the results is 
extremely satisfying, and it is dou-
bly so if one feels that one is mak-
ing a contribution to a greater 
cause. Co-op members can come 
into the store (or cafe, as the case 
may be with the Che), and say to 
themselves, "This place is the way 
it is because of me." 

Be it a new product (or dish), 
repairs that they did, a sign that they 
made or any other contribution, 
they know that the place they work 
is not the same as it would have 
been had they not chosen to come, 
and they are glad that they paid 
attention to the little sign that said, 
"Come work with us." 

Floating on the fringe of the gen-
eral student body's awareness, hid-
den by the clamoring of the eighty 
seven hundred other student orga-
nizations, the co-ops wait for those 
who have the eyes to see them.

Don't Punish Addiction No Pets or Students 
COMMENTARY: Drugs are not the most pressing issue in our society COMMENTARY: La Jolla shuns student renters 
By MARC COMER 
Senior Staff Writer 

I want a Drug Free America. I 
also want a Lexus GS400 and a 
two-bedroom apartment in 
Manhattan, but I won't be get-
ting those anytime soon. If ever. 

Is the drug war over yet, or 
are we still banging our heads 
against the wall? 

First, before you jump to con-
clusions and assume this article is 
about legalizing drugs, ask your-
self these questions: Did I know 
anyone in high school who used 
illegal drugs? Do I kAow anyone 
now who uses illegal drugs? Do I 
use illegal drugs? 

If you answered yes to any of 
the above, you probably realize 
that as long as there are people 
willing to experiment with ille-
gal drugs, illegal drugs will 
exist. It's basic economics: if 
there is demand .... 

How can we expect to keep 
drugs out of our country if we 
can't even keep them out of our 
prisons, said Jesse Ventura in an 
interview with the Union-
Tribune, which ran on UCSD-TV. 

Drugs are everywhere, from 
the ghettos to Wall Street. 

Using this basic rationale 
leads one to ask why the hell the 
U.S. government spends billions 
of dollars trying to curb illegal 
drug use. Now I'm not saying 
that drugs are good. Have you 
ever seen a mentally stable crack 
head? I didn't think so. 

Drugs are bad. They alter 
your mind, can lead to addiction 
and mar even cause you to hurt 
yoursel or others. Wait. Am I 
talking about illegal drugs or 
alcohol and tobacco? 

I think the hard core 

Republicans who think putting 
drug addicts in jail will cure 
their addiction are full of crap -
or possibly on illegal substances. 

Sure, people who choose to 
use drugs are idiots themselves, 
but should the government's 
role be to protect idiots from 
exterminating themselves? Hey, 
that's simple Darwinism, right? 

Do we really care about pea-

-OPINION-
COLUMN 
pie using illegal drugs? No. Do 
we care about drug lords ' mak-
ing millions of dollars off of 
drug sales? No. If we really did, 
we would legalize drugs and 
start taxing them. . 

What we really care about is 
the behavior of those who are on 
drugs. We care about our room-
mates selling our computer to 
buy some marijuana; we care 
about the guy next door pissing 
on our comforter and scratching 
the/aint off the walls during an 
aci trir; we care about the 
potentia for violence that drugs 
can lead to. 

So, explain to me once again 
how sending drug addicts to 
prison is keeping our streets 
safe, is keeping our little broth-
ers and sisters away from push-
ers, is keeping people from 
using illegal drugs. 

Addicts don't choose to 
become addicts. Do you think 
addicts start off saying "I'm 
gonna snort cocaine every day 
until my nose bleeds uncontrol-
lably. I'm gonna smoke so much 
blunt that my eyes glaze over." 

Most jail cells don't have that

therapeutic feel to them, so why 
do we expect drugs addicts to 
come out feeling rehabilitated?

In an article by the Associated

And that is, our crusty politi-

wards ways that they can't even

Ok, so I've embellished a tild, 
but you get the picture. 

In a nutshell. Drugs and drug 
users are here to stay, and while 
drugs are sti ll not good for you, 
we shouldn't criminalize addicts 
who have abuse problems; we 
should help them. 

Arizona has drug laws thilt 
decriminalize drug abuse, so 
why don't we? Isn't California 
far more liberal than the highly 
conservative Arizona? Or is 
everyone afraid that if drug 
users aren't sent to prisons, 
crime will run rampant? 

Most of us afready know 
someone who uses drugs.

Jolla - it was just another 
Spanish name that I filed away 
for future reference. Now, after 
three years of living in the area, I 
think I understand the town a lit-
tle better, and I've learned a thing 
or two. 

Primarily, I learned that La 
Jolla doesn't like us. 

The reasons vary from person 
to person, but the fervor is consis-
tent; we don't dress nice, we 
don't drive expensive cars (or if 
we do they're lowered and have 
weird stickers and tail fins all 
over them), we don't have real 
jobs, we're noisy, we're uncul-
tured and some of us aren't even 
from California for God's sake! 
The horror. 

These sentiments were never 
milde more clear to me than when 
I had to look for a house. First, r 
should stipulate that I mean a 
real, genuine blue-blooded 
house; I've climbed up the hous-
ing food chain ... I began in the 
Warren residence halls, then rose 
through the ranks to the on-cam-
pus apartments, then I finally 
moved off campus to a house. 
I've done my time and I've

property in La 
Jolla that could be considered 
affordable to students. Hell, one 
of the guys I live with has gradu-
ated and has a full-time job and 
he still can't afford any of the 
houses in La Jolla. It's not unusu-
al to see monthly rents of $6,000 
or $8,000 in this upscale town. 
Students fortunate enough to 
come from wealthy families can 
probably swing it, but most stu-
dents can't even hope to live here. 

Nevermind La Jolla then . We 
all have cars, we can live a little 
farther down the road . So after 
trying La Jolla, I looked for places 
in University City, where I was 
living at the time anyway, think-
ing that any area named after an 
institution of higher learning was 
bound to c.ater tv students. Again, 
it's 'hard to believe I was once so 
foolish . 

One of the first agents I called 
about a house in University City 
asked me right off: "Are there any 
students in your group?" 

"Yes, all but one of us." 
"I'm sorry, we're not doing a 

student rental on this property."

Editor: 
On Tuesday, Aug. 10, in a rul-

ing of historic importance, the 
Sixth Circuit C?urt of Appeals in 
Cincinnati allowed black, Latino 
and other minority students to 
become full defending parties in 
the anti-affirmative action law-
suits pending against the 
University of Michigan. This 
decision overturns two lower-
court rulings, which had both 
denied entry of the students in 
the cases. 

In the suit against the 
University of Michigan Law 
School, 41 black, Latino, Asian-
American, Arab, Hawaiian and 

white students as well as the 
Coalition to Defend Affirmative 
Action By Any Means 
Necessary (BAMN), United for 
Equality and Affirmative 
Action (UEAA) and Law 
Students for Affirmative Action 
(LSAA) will be the representa-
tives of the movement to 
defend affirmative action in the 
courtroom. 

The importance of this victo-
ry cannot be overstated in light 
of the fact that the University of 
Michigan cases are likely to 
advance to the United States 
Supreme Court and set national 
precedent. 

Most important, however, is 
the great opportunity that this 
legal victory opens up for others 
across the country who are 
determined to defend affirma-
tive action and fight for integra-
tion and equality in higher edu-
cation. 

The movement to defend 
affirmative action must use this 
case to launch an initiative in 
every school and community to 
build a new, mass civil rights 
movement. 

Just as the civil rights move-
ment in the early 1950s set the 
conditions for the legal victory in 
Brown v. Board of Education in 
1954, we can set the stage for vic-
tory in this case. 

The movement we are build-
ing will not only ensure victory 
in the courtroom, but must also 
result in a continued struggle for 
the fundamental democratiza-
tion of America - opening 
opportunities and making social 
gains for everyone. 

The Civil Rights Movement of 

the 1950s and '60s not only won 
a certain measure of integration 
and equality for black people 
and other minorities, but it also 
won gains for poor whites as 
well. The fight to defend affirma-
tive action in the lawsuits 
against the University of 
Michigan is part of the overall 
struggle to move our society 
toward full equality and integra-
tion. 

The student defendants in the 
Umversity of Michigan Law 
School case are launching the 
"Our Voices Will Be Heard" 
national tour to speak on the 
importance and significance of 
our role in the University of 
Michigan case, to continue the 
process of building a national 
movement for integration and 
equality and the part your cam-
pus can play in this dynamic 
struggle. This time will be differ-
ent. This time, our voices will be 
heard. Join us in this historic fight! 

What you can do: 
- Contact us to bring the 

"Our Voices Will Be Heard" tour 
to your campus. 

- Organize a group on your 
campus fighting in defense of 
integration and affirmative 
action. 

- Become part of the grow-

"You're not renting a house to

'Tm sorry, but we find that 
students are typically messy, they

Apparently, the La Jollans had

I briefly contemplated suing 
the city for falsely advertising in

would just call on its La Jollan

And just like a police chase, the

Clairernont and Mira Mesa, hop-

would mean that my roommates

"I'm afraid this property

HOUSING: 
Students rely on 
luck to get a house 
CoBIIIIH ............. 
rare occasions that we managed to 
get an appointment to see a house 
in University City, we trudged out 
on what had every sign of turning 
out to be another fruitless trip. I 
was three days away from becom-
ing homeless, my ink ~artridge 
had actually dried out from print-
ing lists of houses to call, I was 
wom out from six weeks of house 
hunting and I was basically fed up 
with the world. When we met the 
landlord he showed us the proper-
ty, and my heart sank when I saw 
how nice the place was, realizing 
how low our chances of getting it 
were. 

When we were done looking 
around, the landlord asked us 
when we would be able to move 
in if we got the place. This only 
served to remind me of how 
depressed I was supposed to be 
feeling. I told him we were mov-
ing out in three days and we 
would like to move in immediate-
ly. He looked a little surprised 
and asked why we hadn't found 
a place yet. I was too tired and too 
frustrated to even hold the 
answer back, it just popped out of 
its own accord: 

"People just don't want to rent 
to students," I said dolefully, 
shaking my head. 

He looked a little thoughtful 
upon hearing this and nodded 
slightly. We picked up an applica-
tion and promised that we could 
get them filled out in a few hours, 
being that we had ample practice 
doing so. I gave him my number 
so he could call us to let us know 
where we could deliver the com-
pleted forms. 

A few hours later he called and 
said the place was ours if we 
would commit to renting it imme-
diately. A starving man doesn't 
have to be asked twice if he wants 
a sandwich; I told him we defi-
nitely would, and tried not to 
faint. My head was still swimming 
a few hours later when we came to 
sign the lease. He barely skimmed 
over our applications, it seemed 
he'd already made up his mind 
about us. Before we signed any-
thing he confided how he'd come 
to his decision. 

"The reason I chose you ·was 
because of your answer. I was 
impressed by your honesty. Most 
people try to smooth it over and 
say they hadn't found the right 
place yet, or they were holding 
out, but you told me straight out 
that people don' t like to rent to 
students. I just thought you 
should know that." 

I was too exhausted from look-
ing for a home and too relieved to 
appreciate the irony of the situa-
tion; We finally got a house 
because no one wanted to rent to 
students. Even now I'm too bitter 
about all the time and gas we 
wasted looking for places to 
appreciate it. So I submit the story 
to you - maybe, as an objective 
outside party, you will find it 
amusing, unless it hits a little too 
close to home for you. 

So the synopsis of the story is 
that we talked to 50 people and 
found one nice person out of the 
whole lot, which means we got 
lucky. But, a whole lot of other 
people probably didn't. Maybe it 
doesn't matter, though. Maybe 
this school is just doomed to dry 
up and die as its students 
become homeless and move 
away to places where the fields 
are greener and don't have "No 
Students Allowed On The Grass" 
signs posted everywhere. In 
which case I guess my room-
mates and 1 are some of the last 
ones who actually managed to 
get a house. All you freshmen 
and sophomores, take my 
advice: stay on campus as long 
as you can, and leave La Jolla for 
the La Jollans.

Fate of Abortion Rights in Hands 'ofNext President 
COMMENTARY: This presidential election will be pivotal in setting national abortion policy 
B, SUE DUNLAP 
Director of Public Affairs at 
Planned Parenthood 

If you asked a college-age 
young woman in 1970 if she 
were registered to vote, she 
probably would have responded 
with a "yes." 

If you probed deeper and 
asked why, it's lik.ely she would 
have recited a number of ways 
her vote could transform the 
lives of American women. High 
on the list of legislative and judi-
cial priorities' for the young 
women of this era was legalizing 
abortion. 

Today, the vast majority of 
Americans, young women in 
particular, still support the 1973 
Roe v. Wade Supreme Court 
decision that legalized early 
abortion. But far fewer are using 
their voting powers to support 
the right to choose. 

Why? Because they feel the 
issue has been settled. They 
believe the Roe decision ended 
the debate over legal abortion in 
the United States. 

In fact, the Court's decision 
did not codify a woman's right 
to choose. 

The right to choose is in a pre-
carious state in this country, and 
the next president of the United 
States may very well hold the 
fate of abortion rights in his or 
her hands. 

The next president will name 
as many as three justices to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, potentially 
shifting the balance to an anti-
abortion majority. This could 

President Reagan named 389 
judges. 

The next president could 
refuse to allow research on RU-
486 and other non-invasive abor-
tion procedures. Medical abor-
tion is close to gaining FDA 
approval, but may not be up for 
the presidential seal-of-approval 
until the new administration 
takes office. 

The next president may sympathize with protesters 
who harass women and disrupt services at clinics. He 
or she could withdraw federal marshals from protecting 
clinics, inevitably adding to the mounting figure of more 
than 2,000 acts of violence committee against abortion 
providers. 

result in an overturning of Roe vs. 
Wade , sending women back to 
the hands of unscrupulous and 
untrained abortion providers. 

The. president will also name 
judges to district courts, where 
many more abortion cases a~ 
reviewed . The Administrative 
Office of U.S. Courts reports that 
President Clinton has appOinted 
305 judges, Pres ident Bush 
appointed 195 judges and 

Our next president could 
also refuse to allow the importa-
tion of RU-486 for personal use. 
The FDA allows medication to 
be imported for personal use if 
it is not available or accessible in 
this country. 

RU-486 had been on the list of 
medications banned for importa-
tion. On his first day in office, 
President Clinton issued an exec-
utive order overturning this ban, 

but an anti-abortion President 
could again issue a ban by exec-
utive order. 

The next president may sym-
pathize with protesters who

During his tenure in office, 

President Reagan imposed a 
gag rule on family planning 
providers, prohibiting those 
who received federal funds 
from including abortion in dis-
cussions about pregnancy 
options. President Clinton 
issued an order rescinding this 
prohibition, but it could easily 
be reinstated . 

President Clinton's rick for 
U.S. Surgeon Genera never 
gained office because an anti-
abortion legislature opposed the 
fact that Dr. Henry Foster had 
performed a handful of abor-
tions during his 3D-year medical

8 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Chi Cafe Made Upgrade Poster Child 
COMMENTARY: Suspicious timing.of report seems to be motivated by desire for funding 
By LESUE HENKEl. 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

With the prospect of yet 
another fee increase for UCSD 
students lurking above the fall 
horizon, it seems that the "hope-
lessly decrepit" Che Cafe (as 
alleged by the UniverSity Center 
Advisory Board (UCAB) in the 
June 3 issue of the Guardiall) 
stands to benefit from a $12 mil-
lion upgrade of the Price and 
Student Centers. 

In a so-called "routine" main-
tenance report conducted by 
UCAB, the Che Cafe's existence 
as an upright edifice was esti-
mated as capable of lasting only 
another six years. This estimate 
was fueled by such timely reve-
lations as plumbing problems 
and "a general decay of the inter-
nal nuts and bolts of the Che." 

Now, one must wonder: How 
routine could these maintenance 
reports have t>een if decay - a 
slow and festering process -
was allowed to set in? Does this 
not reveal a tremendous time 
lapse between now and the last 
time that anyone cared to ani-
mate themselves toward rectify-
ing the building'S structural 

"decrepllncies"? Perhaps "rou-
tine" maintenance simply means 
maintenance that occurs when-
ever a fee increase comes up for 
deliberation. 

Given the Che's lengthyexis-
tence of some 20 years on cam-
pus, it stands to reason that a 
"general decay" should have 
been noted 
and attended 
to long ago, if 
it really was 
that important 
of an issue. 
Most notably, 
the passing of 
the last fee ref-
erendum in 
1983 should 
have silenced 
the structural 
iss ues of the 
Che Cafe. 

The 1983 fee 
increase was supposed to allocate 
adequate funds to the Student 
Center, in addition to the construc-
tion of the $20 million complex 
then called the Sol Price Club 
Center; now known as our own 
little backyard mall minus the 
Banana Republic (coming soon!). 

In reality, the university 

skimped on the maintenance 
needed for the Student Center, 
which includes the Che Cafe, and 
diverted maintenance to the cost-
ly Price Center. 

Even after its construction, the 
Price Center continued to receive 
more than $25 per student each 
quarter for its upkeep. According 

to an estimate 
made by Jim 
Carruthers for 
the 1991 fiscal 
year, only 
$438,583 was 
slated for the 

~tudent Center. 
Compare that 
with the 
$650,000 origi-
nally intended 
for the Student 
Center, which 
would be 
brought by a 

$12.50 per student per quarter fee. 
From 1983 to 1999, anr press-

ing structural problems within the 
'Che Cafe should have been dealt 
with by UCAB and the adminis-
tration, and further damage then 
could have been prevented. 

A sudden conspicuous inter-
est in revit~lizing the Che Cafe 

- waving "Intemet access" like 
a parade banner and touting 
refurbished office space for other 
organizations conveniently 
added to the building, does not 
excuse a long-standing neglect of 
the Che's maintenance and 
upkeep by everyone save transi-
tory, over-stressed student and 
youth volunteers. 

All those involved in the Che 
Cafe collective welcome the nec-
essary modemizations and struc-

~ral repairs that will ensure that 
the place we love will remain an 
epitome of music.', culture, politi-
cal activity and fine vegan 
gourmet in San Diego for decades 
to come. But, as the members of 
the collective are so often remind-
ed by the administration, we are 
defined as part of the Student 
Center, and therefore will not be 
portrayed as a special case, which 
the fee referendum is graciously 
trying to accommodate. 

The Che Cafe will gratefully 
accept the aid that is due to our 
organization and the students to 
whom we cater - but we refuse 
to be made the suffering poster 
child for the fee referendum.

Rise in College Costs 
Lowest in 12 Years 

Governor George W. Bush 
Questions His Party's Priorities 

The average cost of attending 
college this school year rose 4.6 
percent at private institutions 
and 3.4 percent at public institu-
tions, the lowest increases in at 
least 12 years but still higher 
than the national rate of infla-
tion, the College Board reported 
Tuesday. 

The board, the nonprofit orga-
nization that administers the 
nation's most widely used stan-
dardized tests for college admis-
sion, calculated the average cost of 
tuition and fees at private four-
year colleges this fall to be $15,380, 
an increase of $671 over the 1998-
1999 school year. At public univer-
sities, the average cost this year is 
$3,356, an increase of $109. 

When expenses for room and 
board, for students who live on 
campus, are added to the figures, 
the average cost of a private col-
lege education this year is 
$21,339, and a public university is 
$8,086. 

Although the rate of increase 

has been slowing at public insti-
tutions since 1991, and at private 
colleges since 1988, neither has 
managed to hold the rise in costs 
to that of inflation, which was 2.3 
percent in the 12-month period 

_ended in August. 
To Terry Hartle, senior vice 

president for the American 
Council on Education, which 
represents 2,000 colleges and . 
universities, public and private, 
that lingering gap is a symptom 
of the pressures brought to bear 
on institutions of higher learn-
ing. 

"Higher education is a labor-
intensive enterprise," Hartle 
said. "Productivity gains come 
slowly. The kinds of things col-
leges could do to increase pro-
ductivity - larger class sizes, 
more junior professors, fewer 
seminars, less books in the 
library - are not desirable."

TIre New York Times 

NEW YORK - Gov. George 
W. Bush of Texas used a speech 
about his proposals for improv-
ing education on Tuesday to 
issue a pointed critique of the 
Republican Party, saying that it 
had put too much emphasis on 
economic wealth and too little 
on social problems. 

It was the second time in less 
than a week that Bush, the front-
runner for the Republican presi-
dential nomination, had cast fel-
low Republicans as insensitive 
and had seemed to be establish-
ing some distance from them. 
On Thursday, Bush accused 
House Republicans of trying to 
"balance the budget on the backs 
of the poor." 

On Tuesday, addressing hun-
dreds of people in a hotel in mid-
town Manhattan, Bush 
digressed somewhat from a dis-
cussion of his education propos-
al also - including a major 
expansion of charter schools -
to offer a sort of apologia for the 
priorities that many Republicans 

have set and for the image that 
they have projected . 

"Too often, my party has 
focused on the national econo-
my, to the exclusion of all else, 
speaking a sterile language of 
rates and numbers, CBO and 
GNP," Bush said, referring to 
the Congressional Budget 
Office and the Gross National 
Product. 

"Of course we want vigor 
and growth in our economy," 
Bush continued . "But there are 
human problems that persist in 
the shadow of affluence. And 
the strongest argument for con-
servative ideals - for responsi-
bility and accountability and 
the virtues of our tradition - is 
that they lead to greater justice, 
less suffering, more opportuni-
ty." 

Bush'~ usual stump ·speech 
and his public remarks almost 
always feature the assertion that 
he is a new kind of Republican -
a "compass.ionate conservative," 
to use his slogan. Again and 

again, he advocates "prosperity 
with a purpose" and declares 
that "prosperity alone is simple 
materialism." 

But any rebuke to fellow 
Republicans is usually implicit. 
Bush's comments on Tuesday 
was decidedly explicit and 
veered toward the confronta-
tional. He seemed to challenge 
fellow Republicans not only to 
look beyond the bottom line 
when assessing the state of the 
nation, but also to devote as 
much energy to ~~blem-solving 
as to stern moraliZing. 

"Too often, on social issues, 
mYlarty has painted an image 
of merica slouching toward 
Gomorrah," Bush said . 

A few sentences later, in 
another swipe at Republicans, 
Bush added, "Too often, my 
party has confused the need for 
limited government with a dis-
dain for government itself."

NEW YORl< - A diet-prod-
uct company Wednesday posted 
on the Internet a complete, 
unedited videotaped interview 
between an ABC News corre-
spondent and the company's 
chief executive in an effort to 
publicize its concerns that ABC 
would broadcast an unfair 
report on the medical risks of its 
popular dietary supplement. 

ABC News spokeswoman 
Eileen Murphy called the post-
ing by the company, Metabolife

Sanators s .. k Way to Put Off Vote on 
Underground Nuclear Test Ban Treaty 

WASHINGTON - With both 
sides acknowledging that the 
Senate will soundly reject a land-
mark treaty banning under-
ground nuclear testing, 
Democrats and Republicans 
each sought a face-saving way 
on Tuesday to put off a vote on 
the accord and declare victory. 

Senators from both parties 
expressed concern that defeating 
the treaty would deal the United 
States an embarrassing diplo-
matic setback and inadvertently 
send the wrong message to 
emerging nuclear powers like 
India and Pakistan that are 
closely watching the Serrate's 
action. 

Sen. Pete Domenici, a senior 
Republican from New Mexico 
who opposes the treaty, said he 
would ask President Clinton at a 
private White House dinner on 
Tuesday night to shelve the 
accord rather than have it reject-
ed . "There are international ram-
ifications for killing it," he said. 

Sen. Joseph Biden of 
Delaware, a top Democratic sup-
porter of the test ban, said with-
drawing the treaty now would 
accomplish the Democrats' goal 
of holding hearings on a pact 
that has been bottled up in the 
Foreign Rel.tions Committee for 

Lott, who as majority 
leader controls what 
matters may come to the 
floor, demanded that 
Clinton request that the 
treaty be withdrawn, and 
that Democrats wait until 
after the 2000 elections 
to bring it up with a new 
Congress and new 
administration. 

more than two years, and allow 
supporters to "live to fight 
another day." 

But both sides sought to 
avoid being seen as caving in to 
pressure. The Senate majority 
leader, Trent Lott, and his 
Democratic counterpart, Tom 
Daschle, took to the Senate floor 
on Tueaday night to quell grow-
ing turmoil within their ranks 
and to announce that top aides 
were working to negotiate a 
graceful way out. 

The initial results were not 
encouraging. 

Lott, who as majority leader 
controls what matters may come 
to the floor, demanded that 

Clinton request that the treaty be 
withdrawn, and that Democrats 
wait until after the 2000 elections 
to bring it up with a new 
Congress and new administra-
tion. Daschle's aides and White 
House officials immediately 
rejected that offer and ratcheted 
up the brinkmanship that has 
quickly consumed one of 
Clinton's top foreign policy 
goals. 

"The president has not 
requested the treaty be with-
drawn," said David C. Leavy, a 
spokesman for the National 
Security Council. "This deal may 
not get done, so we're moving 
full steam ahead." 

But the White House's confi-
dence smacked of false bravado. 
Biden said on Tuesday that he 
had told Clinton that treaty sup-
porters were well short of the 
two-thirds majority required by 
the Constitution to ratify the 
pact. All 45 Democrats are likely 
to vote for the treaty, but only 
two Republicans publicly sup-
port it. Opponents say they have 
more than 40 firm votes against 
the treaty, surpassing the 34 
needed to kill it.

had implications for journalism,

He is guardedly optimistic 
about negotiations between Syria

that an initially positive dialogue

moving along better than the 
atmosphere suggests," he said, 
citing his continuing contacts as 
"a middle man or mediator" 
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud 
Barak and with Syrian President 
Hafez Assad . 

But he said he shared the con-
cerns of many Arab leaders that 
Israeli peace talks with Syria 
could overshadow the much 
more complex and, in his vi~w, 
far more important talks between 
Israel and the Palestinians.

SMOKING: 
Gene may cause 
influence addiction 
ContI ....... from ...,. 1 
issue of the IOl/mal of AdoJesC!!llt 
Healtll. 

Choi, Gilpin and Pierce are 
also part of the UCSD Cancer 
Center's Cancer Prevention and 
Control Program. 

"This paper actually describes 
what's going on out there as best 
we can by individual age groups 
and pOints out where the prob-
lems are," Pierce said. "It doesn ' t 
offer solutions. It just documents 
the size of the problem." 

This problem, they discov-
ered, is greater than the 3,000-
smoker estimate from 10 years 
ago. The report stated that about 
5,000 teenagers under the age of 
18 experiment with smoking 
each day. 0: them, over 1,000 
are 12 year olds and nearly 3,000 
become established smokers -
defined as anyone who has 
smoked 100 cigarettes in his or 
her lifetime and is currently 
smoking. 

There are many factors that 
influence a teenager to try smok-
ing. The UCSD Cancer Center 
has studied the impact of adver-
tising, promotions, films and par-
ents on adolescents. 

"We have proven that the 
biggest predictor [of] who exper-
imentS" is those who like the 
advertising and would wear a T-
shirt with an industry logo on it," 
said Pierce. 

Since the mid-80s, smoking 
among teenagers escalated with 
the start of the Joe Camel adver-
tising campaigns and the popular 
promotional items, particularly 
those by Marlboro, that were 
launched in 90s. 

"The real issue is that in 

order to get that 3,000 [smokers) 
a day, the [tobacco) industry had 
to get 5,000 people to experi-
ment every day," Pierce said. 
"And the tobacco industry is 
very interested in getting people 
to experiment." 

The study found that the key 
to the problem of smoking 
among adolescents is the first 
experimentation - SO percent of 
those who experiment become 
addicted. Although many people 
don't become regular smokers 
until later in life, most try their 
first cigarettes between the ages 
of 12 and 14. The dismal reality, 
Pierce said, is that experimenting 
can lead not only to addiction, 
but also to death. 

"We know that approximate-
ly half of those who smoke 
become addicted," Pierce said. 
"Of the people who become 
addicted, approximately half 
will smoke for over 20 years. Of 
those who aren't able to quit for 
20 years, we know half of them 
will die [from] a smoking related 
disease." 

Addiction to smoking may be 
an untontrollable habit for some 
people. Currently, a number of 
researchers are attributing genet-
ic linkage to who becomes 
addicted and who cloesn't. 

"We do think there is a biolog-
ical basis. Some people are able to 
smoke and not become addicted 
and are able to get out of it," said 
Pierce. The problem, Pierce 
added, is that over half are 
unable to quit. 

The UCSD Cancer Center is a 
major source of smoking research 
in California. It is working 
toward finding out the genetic 
relationship in addictive smok-
ing. For people who want coun-

GALBRAITH:

ContInued fro.- ..... 1 
She may also adopt that name. 

Lucas said, however, that 
UCLA's program is still regard-
ed as a computer lab. The new 
program at UCSD will be a "vir-
tuallibrary. " 

UCSD is actually behind the 
times when it comes to online 
resources, said Lucas, who has 
also researched programs of 
schools outside the UC system, 
across the country. 

Computer instruction and 
education will also be offered 
by the new entity. One of 
Lucas' goals is to/rovide a bet-
ter e-mail an computer-
researching orientation for new 
students. 

A few years ago, the B-year-
old proposal to renovate the 
building was rewritten in con-
sideration of advances in com-
puter technology made in the 
late 1990s, Lucas said. 

Moving the same books back 
into the building seemed like an 
antiquated notion. 

Since there will no longer be 

a solely undergraduate-oriented 
library facility, other campus 
libraries, such as the Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography and 
Biomedical libraries, will take on 
the task of ordering and organiz-
ing undergraduate materials, 
Lucas said. 

Concerning the amount of 
foot traffic that will transfer from 
Geisel to the new facility, Lucas 

Computer instruction 
and education will also 
be offered by the new 
entity. One of Lucas' 
goals is to provide a 
better e-mail and 
computer-researching 
orientation for new 
students. 

quoted a co-worker of hers who 
believes that "if there are com-
puters, there will be students." 

The video playback center, 
once housed in the undergradu-
ate library at Galbraith Hall, 
will remain in Geisel Library. It 
has integrated well with the art 
and architecture library in the 
non-print media area of Geisel, 

Thursday. October 7. 1999 

Lucas said. 
Reserves will also remain at 

the main library. 
Proposed as an addition to 

the virtual library is a collection 
of what is commonly referred to 
as "recreational reading" 

The renovation to Galbraith 
Hall was begun to renew the fire 
walls, electrical and mechanical 
systems, and to correct circula-
tion and accessibility problems, 
said John Sturla, the project 
architect from campus design 
and construction assigned to the 
building. 

"It's one of the oldest build-
ings on the original part of the 
campus - it was time to freshen 
it up," Sturla said. 

All upgrades were interior. 
The building was demolished 
down to existing structure, Sturla 
said. No new space was created, 
but two elevators were added. 

The funds for the renovation 
and the new computer library, as 
well as the computers, come 
mainly from state bonds. An ini-
tiative making the work possible 
was passed by Califomia voters 
prior to the start of construction. 

Galbraith Hall is named after 
John S. Galbraith, who served as 
UCSD's second chancellor from 
1964-1968.

UCI Caught Selling Body Parts 
SCANDAL: Director allegedly sold spinal cords for to hospital for $5,(0) 
By RACHEUE GINES, SARAH 
LOPEZ .nd STAN KAlWA 
UC Irvine New University 

What started out as a routine 
annual audit in the UCI School 
of Medicine's Department of 
Anatomy and Neurobiology 
unfolded into UCl's worst scan-

- dal in the last four years. 
The Department of 

Anatomy's Willed Body 
Program is currently under 
investigation for the illegal sale 
of seven spinal cords to an 
Arizona hospital. Christopher S. 
Brown, director of the Willed 
Body Program allegedly sold the 
spines to St. Joseph's Hospital 
for more than $5,000. 

UCI officials said Brown was 
terminated Sept. 24, and has 
been placed on administrative 
suspension with pay since the 
end of July, when the investiga-
tion began. The $5,125.50 check, 
made out to the Irvine-based 
University Medical/Health 
Services is not an organization 
the UCI Administration recog-
nizes, officials said . 

The information of the sale of 
the spines, however, did not tum 
up until internal auditors 
noticed a $200 expense by 
Brown for an unscheduled trip 
to Arizona, officials said. 

While the audit was under-
way, Anatomy Department Chair 
Richard T. Robertson also discov-
ered an alarming piece of inJor-
mation on the Replica Notes web 

sight: An anatomy class was 
being offered by the Irving com-
pany using a human cadaver. 

.. About the same time as the 
audit, I literally stumbled across 
the web sight," Robertson said. 

Specifically, the sight offered 
a class focusing on a human 
anatomy autopsy experience, 
Robertson added . The anatomy 

The use of cadavers is 
often limited to 
accredited universities 
and medical institutions. 
The fact that a private 
company had access to 
cadavers prompted 
Robertson to investigate. 
class, which was offered at a fee, 
featured the use of cadavers to 
help medical students increase 
their knowledge of human 
anatomy. . 

"It grabbed my attention," 
Robertson said . "How does a 
private company get a human 
body? You can't just buy one." 

The use of cadavers is often 
limited to accredited universities 
and medical institutions. The 
fact that a private company had 
access to cadavers prompted 
Robertson to investigate. 

Robertson said he asked one 
of his colleagues to call Replica 
and inquire about that class, par-
ticularly about the advertised 

cadaver. The colleague, whom 
Robertson declined to identify, 
reported to him that the body 
was provided by UCl's Willed 
Body Program, an organization 
Robertson oversaw. 

Concerned even more, 
Robertson met with Kathleen A. 
Bisuano, department manager of 
anatomy and neurobiology. She 
agreed they should alert Thomas 
C. Cesario, dean of the College 
of Medicine. 

Available records at the 
Willed Body Program do not 
document the transport of bod-
ies to Replica Notes, and Frasier, 
owner of Replica Notes, would 
not comment on whether or not 
the class received cadavers from 
the Willed Body Program. 

However, incomplete records 
and a virus that destroyed com-
puter files at the Willed Body 
Program are complications that· 
Cesario acknowledges. 

"We are trying to reconstruct 
them now," Cesario said. 

Once Cesario was notified, 
the administration called in the 
Orange County District 
Attorney's office to investigate 
the possibility of criminal activi-
ty by Brown. 

District Attorney spokes- ' 
woman Tori Richards confirmed 
the D.A.'s involvement, but 
declined to offer any details. 

"We've had the case for about 
two or three weeks now, but 
other than thaf, I can't com-
ment," Richards said.

a theory which they say will 
"demonstrate that everything in 
the universe is alive, eternal and 
evolving." 

Schwartz and Russek teamed 
up with a group of spiritual 
mediums to study the possibility 
of communicating with the dead 
in a series of experiments in 
February. 

"I am not advocating survival 
of consciousness," Schwartz said.

Museums have a bad rap. They're tp<> quiet, too cold and (da~e. it be said) too boring for the average college ~tudent. Besides, when students are ~king down half a meal before 
sprinting to classes in which they just regurgi-
tate the. notes that they crammed into their 
heads while "studying" the night before, who's 
got time to check out some crummy gallery? 

Everyone. 
Students don't have to spend their entire 

days at museums, and they don't need a 
degree in art to appreciate the many art 
resources in San Diego. They don't even have 
to travel very far in order to find a gallery that 
is showing something new, amazing or beauti-
ful. 
UnlYenlty Art o.IIery 

On the west end of campus, for example, 
just north of the Hump between Revelle and 
Muir colleges, lies the University Art Gallery. 
Five or six exhibits are presented in this gallery 
each year. In the past, the gallery has exhibited 
interactive video art as well as paintings and 
sculptures. Admission is always free and the 
location can't be beat. More information about

Just down the hill from UCSD lies the 
Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla . 

Admission for students is a mere $2, and visi-
tors get substantially more than they pay for. 
The museum focuses on art created after 1950 
and is currently exhibiting "The Museum as 
Muse: Artists Reflect," which offers an intro-
spective look at museums and modern and 
contemporary artists' attitudes toward them.

A Whole New Jean-re Coming to UCSD 
Musical artist Wyclefjean pushes the boundaries of music and raises consciousness through charity 
By JEREMY GRAY 
Senior Staff Writer 

From Haiti to Hollywood, 
Wyclef Jean lived the st ruggle 
before he could enjoy the success. 
Often better known as the front-
man of The Fugees (the multi-
platinum group that launched the 
solo careers of rapper Pras and 
media darling Lauren Hill ), Jean 
now enjoys critical praise and 
commercial succe s for his 
unique mix of hip-hop, reggae 
and yes, the occasional violin con-
certo. Fans can see these talents 
on display when Jean and the ' 
Refugee AI :stars headline the 
show at the I<IMAC arena on Oct. 
14. The show starts at 8 p.m. 

After the critically praised 
Fugees debuted with Blllllted all 
Reality and their follow-up smash 
The Score, Jean's tumultuous life 
experiences all came together in 
the release of his solo album Ti,e 
Carl/ivai, a work as autobiograph-
ical as it was successful. Whether 
retelling the murder of his cousin 
("Gun Powder") or describing his 
run-in with the seventh com-
mandment ("To All the Girls"), 
The Carnival effortlessly fuses 
hip-hop and reality. 

"The whole album was done 
on an emotional trip. And it's 
some stuff that everybody can 
relate to. It's that everyday cycle 
that we go through," Jean stated. 

Born into a rough Haitian 
world, Jean moved to the some-
what less hellish streets of Brook-
lyn when he was nine. Although 
an immoral life beckoned him, he 
was fortunate to have his mother 

4 Pack 
SlIIppIe 

................. l1li. 

looking out for him. 
"When you're a kid growing 

up in Brooklyn, you have two 
choices. ,(ou could either choose 
to do something artistic, whether 
it's music, writing or whatever-
or you choose to be in the other 
life. There ain't no middle. My 
mother just geared me toward the 
music, so the streets wasn't that 
much peer pressure for me," Jean 
said. 

Jean then took his musical 
abilities and ran with them, never 
content unless he was pushing 
music in new directions. How 
else could one explain the New 
York Philharmonic Orchestra's 
contribution to his song "Gone 
Till November," for which even 
the legendary Bob Dylan had a 
cameo role in the video? But as 
Jean's music proves, eclectic pair-
ings are what he's all about. His 
latest track "New Day" features 
unlikely partner U2's Bono, who 
joined Jean on Sept. 7 to record a 
VH1 "Storytellers" segment. He 
also accompanied Jean when they 
performed their new song on 
Sept. 8 in New York at the Wyclef 
Jean Foundation's Caribbean 
Soiree. The charity event also 
benefi ted from performances by 
George Clinton and Joan 
Osborne. 

With the Smokin' Grooves 
Tour and Woodstock '99 under 
his belt, Jean has had a busy 
year. Next up is NetAid 
(lrttp://www.lletaid.org).aninter-
national anti-poverty charity 
concert to be held on Oct. 9 that

Something To Write Home About 

......... 

-**** 
As driven as it is heartfelt, The 

Get Up Kids Somethil/g to Write 
Home Abollt will wrestle 45 min-
utes of time from your life with 
ripping guitar riffs, catchy cho-
ruses, provocative "ballads and 
enough pent-up emotion to start 
a Richard Simmons telethon. 

The album begins fast and 
furious with "Holiday," which 
does not allow the listener time to 
catch up to the pop lyricism and 
battling guitar solos. Things slow 
down a bit with "Valentine," 
which ponders the reality of signs 
pointing to a Jading relationship. 
"Out of Reach" takes rove a step 
further, sending it overseas and 
bringing with it all of the anxiety 
and fear that a long-distance 
lover can concoct (Out of mind, alit 
of sight, out of I'f!ach / Start over is I/O 
way to begin). But just when you 
think The Kids may be getting the 
raw end of every relationship in 
the history of man ("Long Good-
night"), they come storming back 
with confidence and some dandy 
guitar playing ("Red Letter 
Day"). 

The Get Up Kids have proven 
once again that there's nothing 
wrong with sticking to what 
works. It may not be their best 
stuff, but Something to Write Hame 
Abollt sure is a heck of a lot more 
original than most of the saturat-
ed post-punk gracing the radio 
stations these days.

The Fragile 

---
-*** 

Upon release of the album, 
Nine Inch Nails himself, Trent 
Reznor, stated that TIre Fragile 
would "either make or break" his 
career. Upon first listen to the dou-
ble CD set, the meaning of 
Reznor's statement becomes very 
clear - it is an album without a 
single, without a direct sound and 
without the appeal that Reznor has 
always carried in his back pocket. 

What The Fragile does have is 
the voice of one of the decade's 
most coveted musicians doing 
what he does best: making music 
that must be truly listened to in 
order to be appreciated. 

The album is strictly for devot-
ed Nine Inch Nails fans, whose 
fan base exploded after the 
release of 1994's Tile DoWllward 
Spiral, making the band one of the 
most mainstream acts in the 
music industry. Now, five years 
later, Reznor's only downfall is 
that he strayed from his formula. 

1989's Pretty Hate Mac/,ille cap-
tured the synth-pop sound of the 
late '80s, 1992's Brokell was filled 
with the heavy guitar riffs that 
were. popular at the time and TIre 
DowI/ward Spiral manifested the 
originality that defined the alter-
native music movement. 

In 1999, however, Reznor finds 
himself in a genre without a genre; 
a time without a musical style to 
lead it into the millennium. Nine 
Inch Nails has always released the 
perfect album at the perfect time. 
Yet, like Reznor, TIre Fragile seems 
unsure of itself. The music sounds 
as if it's searching for an idea it 
cannot possibly grasp. 

The album contains the vin-
tage lines of pain and suffering 
that define our dark hero, yet the 
chip on Reznor's shoulder has 
made its ,p.resence clear. Tracks 
such as 'The Wretched" and 
"We're In This Together Now" 
stand out as new classics in the 
discography, yet songs like "The 
Day the World Went Away" seem 
out of place. 

Overall, Tile Fragile is full of 
superior music that beats any 
other current release. After com-
ing to expect the best from some-
one, however, it's easy to be let 
down a bit, and Reznor is certain-
ly one to expect it from.

One thing about Chris Cornell 
is that he's damn good at writing 
songs - damn good. Since the 
mid-'80s, the former leader of 
Soundgarden has been a man 
unrecognized and unappreciated 
for his work. Many people today 
still believe that Templt of tire Dog 
was Eddie Vedder's pet rroject, 
not realizing that Cornel wrote 
every song on the album. Not 
many people know that every hit 
Soundgarden single was written 
by Cornell, and often, solely by 
him. 

Three years after the 
Soundgarden break-up and the 
official end of grunge, the 
decade's greatest songwriter is 
hoping his new solo album will 
fly. And it does. Soundgarden 
may have been the cornerstone of 
the grunge era, but Cornell's 
voice and style are timeless. After 
one run-through, "Preaching the. 
End of the World" and "Wave 
Goodbye" are songs that listeners

will feel like they have known 
forever. Every track is comfort-
able and familiar, as if the album 
was recorded next to a log fire on 
a cold winter night. Ellplrorin 
Mornillg is the beginning of a solo 
career that has been anticipated 
for quite some time. 

Cornell understands the 
industry, the fans and the critics, 
which-is how he manages to cater 
to them all. He is one of the few 
capable of creating the catchy 
tunes that even skeptical Rol/illg 
Stolle critics commend. Every 
song is just as complicated as it is 
simple, leaving room for a pletho-
ra of new fans . From the high-
pitched wails, to the dreary 
moans, Euplroria Marl/illg is a 
strong step in the right direction 
for Cornell, but by no means is it 
his best work. In "Disappearing 
One" he sings, "But I will come 
again and you will let me in, and 
you'll see I never disappear for 
long." I don't know about anyone 
else, but I take comfort in that.

When the movie "Clueless" 
made the transition to television 
sitcom, the entire cast stayed 
aboard with the exception of Ali-
cia Silverstone. 

The same thing happened to 
the Long Beach Dub Allstars, 
except that their star died 
(although some would make a 
similar argument for Silver-
stone's career). What's left is all 
the components of the original 
band, Sublime, a damn fine 
Bradley Nowell impersonator in 
Opie Ortiz, and some real funky 
dub. What's missing is the soul. 

Luckily, the Allstars have a 
better ensemble to work with 
than the ill-fated aforementioned 
sitcom, and it shows on such rich-
ly grooved tracks as "New Sun" 
and the funky familiarity of 
"Trailer Ras," which could moon-
light as Jerry Springer's new 
theme song. Simply put, these 
guys can still jam, whether it 
means laying down reggae toasts 
(Tippa Irie on "Sensi") or thick 
bass lines that roll deep and 
steady ("Righteous Dub"). How-
ever, a song like "Rosarito" needs 
Bradley's emotionally-textured 
voice to give the lyrics more 
depth. Instead, it comes off like a 
drunken impersonation at the 
local karaoke bar .

Bandidos on Stage 
California's history come to the Rep in 'Bandidol' 
By MElODY GONZALES 
Senior Staff Writer 

History takes center stage at the San 
Diego Repertory Theatre in Luis Valdez's 
" Bandido! An American Melodrama." 
The play presents the story of Tiburcio 
Vasquez, a Mexican revolutionary, a 
ladies' man and, incident<llly, the I~st 
man to be publically and 

fornia 's history often ignored by main-
stream historical studies, playwright 

V~ldez traces Vasquez's story through 
myths and history to create the lead char-
acter of his melodrama. 

" I'm very fascin~ted by history, and I 
consider it to be one of the prime des-
tinies of the theater," Valdez said to the 
cast of "Bandido!" during its first 

legally hanged in Califor-
nia . From 1850 to 1875, 

From 1850 to 1875, 
Vasquez was known to 
the white public as an 
outlaw, a train robber and 

~ horse thief. To the 
women, however, he was 
al 0 known .IS a gentle-
man and poet. Lead actor 
Alex Mendoza creates a 
slick, charism~tic Tibur-
cio that transitions easily 
from a powerful figure to 
a rom~ntic charmer. 

Whi Ie traveling 
through California as a 
notorious bandit, Tibur-
cio captu res the hearts of 
many women, including 
RosiHio Leiva, a young 
ma rr ied woman who 
later becomes pregnant 
with his chi ld. Performed

rehearsal. 
As a highly recognized 
socio-poli tic~ 1 playwright 
and director, Va'idez is 
celebr~ted for his ~bility 
to interweave history, 
myth and political com-
ment~ries . As proven by 
his films, "La Bamba" 
and "Zoot Suit," Valdez is 
able to recapture various 
eras of Mexican-Ameri-
ca n history by creating 
educational and enter-
taining performance 
pieces . 

In "Bandido!," Valdez 
uses both a melodramatic 
and somewhat Shake-
spearean format as the 
structure for his play, 
which is actually two 
plays wrapped into one. 

The first " play" is told 
from the perspective of

beautifully and passionately. EscobiH's 
vocal talents, however, do not quite match

tive. T he second version is told 
from Tiburcio's point of view, 
as he sits on death row remem-
bering the adven tures of his life 
and a rgues against Gillette' s 
misrepresentations. 

Although this duality of 
simultaneous perspectives is 
interesting, it becomes a bit con-
fusing and distracting at times. 
It is possible that this confusion 
is part of Valdez's ultimate 
socio-political commentary and 
personal cha llenge to make 
audiences question history. Per-
haps the duality ind ica tes tha t 
Valdez wants audiences to con-
sider whose history is being 
portrayed roy a play or book, 
and if such a work, or its author, 
is ignoring alternative historical 
perspectives. 

"Eventually what I want to 
do is to use my plays to retrace 
the history of California ... to 
understand the social evolution 
of the region, where it is at, 
where it is going," Valdez said 
in explaination of the relation-
hip between hi tory and the-

ater. 

Through the music, comedy, 
melodrama and genuine drama 
of " Bandido!," Valdez offers a 
new take on the historical issues 
of Manifest Destiny and the 
annexation of Mexico's territory. 
In an increasingly multi-cultural 
society, Valdez is aware of the 
importance in recognizing the 
way~ in which past events have 
shaped, and continue to shape, 
the future of America . 

"This is history and we need 
to know this. The myth of Cali-
fornia. We need to know how 
we're involved in the mytholo-
gy that has brought us here," 
Valdez said . "The only way you 
ca n do that is through art. 
Through paintings and through . 
music, through theater, litera-
ture. And so I hope that 'Bandi-
do! ' can serve that process. An 
American play, an American 
process." 

"Bandido!" is scheduled to 
run through Oct. 17 at the San 
Diego Repertory Theatre in 
Horton Plaza's Lyceum Stage.

Oktoberfest Celebrates 
German Culture 
Sauerkraut, schnapps, bratwurst, polka and frank-
forters invade this streets of EI Cajon this week 
By BRENT DON 
Senior Staff Writer 

For three years my family lived in what 
was then West Germany, in a little town 
that lay just beyond the American Air 
Force base in Rammstein. For me as a 
young boy, Oktoberfest was about travel-
ing to interesting cities and seeing a vast 
panorama of architecture and history. It 
was about eating good food from dozens 
of booths that were crowded together on 
fairgrounds, constructing miniature 
medieval markets and thoroughfares. It 
was about standil.l~ up on my tippy toes to 
buy ice cream or chocolates with my few 
saved pfennigs from :.uliiCflne who didn't 
speak my language, but still knew what I 
wanted and smiled when they handed it 
over. It was about music, and people danc-
ing, and laughter and fun . 

Now that I'm 21 it still means all that 
and beer to boot. Is this heaven or what? 

There are various Oktoberfest events 
throughout San Diego. Last weekend La 
Mesa hosted theirs, and during this 
upcoming weekend and the weekend of 
the 16-17, the German American Societies 
of San Diego will be hosting their 34th 
Annual Traditional German Oktoberfest in 
EI Cajon. 

The festival is located at 1017 South 
Mollison Ave, EI Cajon. It starts at noon 
and continues until 10 p .m. Admission to 
the festivities is $1 for adults and free for 
those who are under 21, so there is a con-

solation prize if you're not old enough to 
appreciate the finest wares of Oktoberfest. 

The beer garden at EI Cajon's Oktober-
fest will feature a wide variety of German 
beers (not surprisingly) as well as some 
domestic brands, although who in their 
right mind goes to Oktoberfest to drink 
American beer? For those who wish to 
explore the full range of what German dis-
tilleries have to offer, there will also be a 
full bar serving several kinds of schnapps. 
Some of you might not know it, but 
schnapps isn't just something you take a 
shot of on a dare, or something you buy for 
your buddy when you're toasting him on 
his birthday. If the only brand of schnapps ' 
you've ever had is the supermarket variety 
that you inherited from your roommate, 
you owe it to yourself to try the real decrl. 

Of course Oktoberfest isn't all about 
drinking. Food also plays an important 
part. All the mainstays of German cuisine 
will be available, including bratwurst, 
assorted wieners and sausages, potato 
pancakes, pretzels and of course sauer-
kraut. Up until very recently I never really 
understood the German's fascination with 
sauerkraut. Then I tried some with a pint 
of beer. Oh man. The combination of beer 
and sauerkraut is insidious; you have a 
helping of one, and you immediately get a 
craving for the other. The bittemess in the 
beer compliments the sour taste of the 
sauerkraut very nicely, and vice versa. It's

Clooney, WhaIberg, Cube Reign as 'Kings' 
Half comic-action, half serious war drama, Three Kings' walks the fine line between goof and greatness 
By WALT DICKINSON 
Hiatus Ec:/itor 

The fact that the catalyst for 
the plot of this film is the discov-
ery of a treasure map hidden in 
the ass of an Iraqi soldier is a clear 
indication that "Three Kings" is 
anything but a ·serious war 
drama. 

However, there is a sufficient 
degree of honesty and nobility in 
the film that sets it apart from the 
deluge of cheesy, shoot-every-
thing-in-sight, comic-action films . 

Within this bittersweet con-
trast of humor, action and drama 
lies a clever story about a group 
of soldiers that plots to steal a 
huge load of Kuwaiti bullion 
(that's gold, mind you, not the lit-
tle cubes you put in hot water to 
make soup). rn the process, the 
soldiers discover that the war 
they fought in isn't over for the 
people they supposedly fought 
for. 

"Kings" takes place toward 
the end of the Persian Gulf War, 
after the cease-fire treaty between 
the Allied forces and Iraq has 
been signed . A group of Ameri-
can soldiers discover a map indi-
cating the location of an Iraqi 
bunker that holds (among other 
spoils of war) millions of dollars 
in gold . 

With little interest in returning 
to their day jobs (or lack thereof) 
in the United States, the soldiers 
set out in search of the gold. In 
the process, they find themselves 
entangled in a conflict between

26 SPORTS 

BASEBALL: 
Postseason should 
be interesting 
Continued from ..... 35 
series between the Atlanta 
Braves and the Houston Astros. 

It is no secret that the Braves' 
strength lies in their pitching 
staff, a staff that has been the best 
in the league since the early '90s. 
The Astros, on the other hand, 
are a more balanced team - a 
team with no true weaknesses. 

As in recent years, their 
offense rides on the shoulders of 
Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio, 
while the pitching ~taff is 
anchored by the only twenty-
game winning tandem in the 
league, Jose Lima and Mike 
Hampton, as well as game-one 
winner Shane Reynolds. 

I am going to throw caution to 
the wind here and say that, for 
the first time ever, the Braves 
will lose a divisional playoff 
series and the Astros will 
advance in four games. 

The other National League 
matchup should not be as close, 
although it is shaping up to be 
closer than I would have 
guessed . 

The Arizona Diamondbacks 
emerged from the cellar this year 
to take the National League West 
while the Mets had to use their 
best pitcher, Al Leiter, in the 
playoff game with the Reds just 
to get to where they are now. 
Randy Johnson, Todd 
Stottlemyer and an offense that 
would make Cy Young turn over 
in his grave should be more than 
enough to carry the 
Diamondbacks over an exhaust-
ed Mets team. The Mets' game 
one victory against Johnson 
should be just what the 

Diamondbacks needed to fuel 
the fire that carried them to the 
National League west this sea-
son. 

The National League 
Championship Series could truly 
be one for the ages, as both teams 
have three excellent starting 
pitchers and offensive lineups 
that can turn close games into 
blowouts before fans can ask the 
vendors for $8 Natural lees. The 
series could very well come 
down to a seventh game, one 
which probably would have the 
Diamondbacks starting Randy 
Johnson. 

Johnson has shown a late-
season kick this year that has

pitching at all. This problem was 
exploited by the Yankees 
Tuesday night when they white-
washed the Rangers 8-0. The 
Rangers have more of the same 
to look forward to as they will 
more than likely get swept by the 
Yankees once again. 

The series between the 
Cleveland Indians and the 
Boston Red Sox is probably the 
most intriguing of all the first-
round series. The Red Sox, by the 
record, are the worst team in the 
playoffs. However, they also 
have Pedro Martinez (the best 
pitcher in the league) going for 
them in game one and probably 
again in game four. Martinez has 

"To go along with their awesome pitching staff, the 
Yankees offense is perhaps the most balanced in the 
league (there isn't a single easy-out anywhere in their 
lineup). They should have no trouble with the Texas 
Rangers, who again this year have an awesome 
offensive juggernaut but no pitching at all." 
been absent in the past, and I 
would hate to bet against him in 
a hig game this season. I predict 
the Diamondbacks will make it 
to their first World Series by win-
ning a seven-game classic series. 

In the American League, the 
Yankees are still the team to beat. 
Their pitching staff has three 
starters. all of whom could be 
No. 1 starters on most teams: 
David Cone, Roger Clemens and 
Orlando Hernandez. 

To go along with this awe-
some staff, the Yankee offense is 
perhaps the most balanced in the 
league (there isn't a single easy-
out anywhere in their lineup). 

They should have no' trouble 
with the Texas Rangers, who 
again this year have an awesome 
offensive juggernaut but no 

been basically unstoppable of 
late and will be a runaway win-
ner in the Cy Young award bal-
loting. The Indians game one 
victory against Martinez was a 
big blow to the Red Sox chances 
at winning the series. 

So the question is, if 
Martinez can win his other 
start, can the Red Sox manage 
two more victories to win the 
series? It will be close. but I 
think that Martinez's brother 
Ramon will probably have 
enough to keep the potent 
Indian lineup in check and win 
one game and then it will be up 
to the Red Sox offense to win 
the other game for them. 

I have a feeling the chowder 
heads in Boston are up to the 
challenge and will manage to

squeak out the series in five 
games. 

If the World Series shapes up 
the way I think it should, it will 
truly be a clash of titans. The 
Yankees have no answer for 
Randy Johnson unless Roger 
Clemens can find his form of 
yesteryear. If Johnson does this, 
he should win two games for the 
Diamondbacks. After that. how-
ever. the matchups are complete-
ly up in the air. The 
Diamondbacks probably have a 
slight advantage in the area of 
offensive force while the Yankees 
are slightly better on the mound. 

Unfortunately these types of 
baUles often come down to the 
bullpen - and the Yankees have 
one of the more unhittable 
closers in the league in Mariano 
Rivera, plus the Yankees have 
the experience advantage, hav-
ing won the series two out of the 
past three years. 

As much as it pains me to pre-
dict,l feel that it is inevitable that 
the Yankees will again be tri-
umphant when the end of 
October rolls around, and I will 
again retire to my room and 
wonder what it will take for 
there to be a storybook ending to 
a season, as there was in 1988 
with the Dodgers or in 1~7 with 
the Marlins. 

Even a small upset would fill 
my hunger for a suprise in the 
October classic. 

As I am sure all you faithful 
readers of "Reality Check" 
know, I have been known to be 
quite incorrect when it comes to 
this prediction stuff. 

Don't be suprised to see the 
Indians win the World Series and 
the Diamondbacks get swept in 
the first round. As long as some-
one other than the Braves beats 
the Yankees, I 40n't care how far 
off my predictions are.

MONEY: 
SDSU struggles to 
provide funding 
CoIItInued froIn ..... 28 
the foundation seeks out funds 
from donors across the nation. 

"If we're going to keep up with 
tomorrow, we have to find our 
supporters today," Blaylock said. 

Blaylock said the increase in 
donations this year is primarily 
because of the department's part-
nership with Cox 
Communications. 

Instead of only broadcasting 
team scores, Cox publicizes stu-
dent athletes who are helping in 
the community and achieving 
high GPAs. 

"Our athletics attracts peo-
ple," Blaylock said . "People want 
to be associated with success on 
the field and in the classroom." 

Rising costs have contributed 
to the deficit and have caused the 
foundation to seek out more 
donations, Blaylock said. 

For example, ten years ago the 
cost of an athletic scholarship was 
$4,452. Now, scholarships run 
close to $15,000 apiece. 

On Friday, the foundation 
hopes to generate an additional 
$150,000 at the ninth annual 
Aztec Scholarship Dinner 
Auction. During the evening, the 
foundation will auction off 20 
items, including a vacation pack-
age and other gifts courtesy of 
the San Diego Padres, the 
Chargers, Barona Casino and the 
Goodyear Blimp. All proceeds 
will benefit the Aztec 
Scholarship Fund. 

"It's a great time to be a stu-
dent," Blaylock said. "It's a great 
time for alum to be a part of the 
university. It's a great time to be 
proud of SDSU."

acupuncture treatment. There 
has been only one athlete who 
was recommended to try the 
acupuncture and refused . 
Nonetheless, 30 is a good num-
ber to start with. 

Now, the question of results 
comes into play. Indeed, the nee-
dles create a striking scene, but it 
is generally a fact that athletes 
will try anything if its going to 
help them get back into the 
game. 

Mecham says the treatment 
has given him mixed results, but 
he has no plans to discontinue 
the curious therapy. 

"It's interesting," Mecham 
said. "It's different. It's weird. 
It's new. I guess it's old, actual-
ly. But it hasn't adversely affect-
ed me at all, so I'll try to get 
something good out of it." 

Callison reported that every 
one of the athletes he has treat-
ed in the training room has 
seen some kind of improve-
ment. 

Klaiber reported one case 
where a patient worked for 
three days with the traditiQnal 
methods of treating a sore, 
swollen knee. 

Trainers gave the patient ice, 
did stretching exercises and 
even used the electronic devices 
on the knee and saw slow 
progress. 

The patient then underwent 
one acupuncture session, and 
was able to stretch the knee 30 
more degrees - a dramatic 
improvement. 

Klaiber herself has even start-
ed to receive the acupuncture 
treatment on her back.

"It's like a little pin prick and 
it's over," Mecham said. "Once

doesn't hurt at all." 

Klaiber and Callison have 
agreed that he and his staff will

2000 season, then at the end of 
the year they will evaluate how 
the new therapy fared.

SD5U Athletics Stili 
Dealing with Deficit 
DINERO: Director feels strain of raising funds 
By JESSICA ZlSKO 
San Diego State University 

(U-WIRE) SAN DIEGO 
Every morning Reggie Blaylock 
walks into his office with one 
thought on his mind - how to 
raise enough money for the ath-
letic programs at San Diego State 
University (SDSU). 

As executive director of the 
AZtec Athletic Foundation and an 
alumnus athlete of SDSU, Blaylock 
is in charge of helping make ends 
meet on the department's $15 mil-
lion budget this academic year. 

Since January, the foundation 
has raised a record-breaking $1.5 
million in donations for athletic 
scholarships, 27 percent more 
than any other time in its history 
and is expecting to raise close to 
$2.5 million before December. 

Donations have poured in 
from alumni, businesses, corpora-
tions and other friends of the uni-
versity. 

Even with this increase in 
donations, however, the athletics 
department is still strugsling to 
find the funds to meet its budget 
deficit. 

At the beginning of the school 
year, the athletics budget was in 
the red more than $400,000. 

The deficit originally began to 
rise in 1993 when the California 
State University system and the 
California National Organization 
for Women (Cal-NOW) agreed to 
equalize expenditures between 
men and women sports on col-
lege campuses. 

The ag~ment stated that, by 
the 1998-1999 school year, CSU 
expenditures for women's athlet-

ic programs would be within 10 
percent of the expenditures spent 
on men's sports. 

To meet this agreement, SDSU 
was forced to shift its funds 
around, which ended up creating 
a $3 million deficit. 

In. 1998, SDSU struck a deal 
with athletics, granting the depart-
ment non-state funds of $800,000 
for 1998-99 and $400,000 for 1999-
2000. The state also provided the 
department with $2 million. 

When the deficit was still not 
covered by the beginning of the 
school year, SDSU granted the 
department an interest-bearing 
loan of $500,000 that is expected 
to be repaid by next year. 

"Raising enough money was 
not just a matter of snapping their 
fingers," said Ken Perry, vice 
president of financial affairs for 
SDSU. "When the deficit started 
rising. we needed to address it. 
Our plan was the best we could 
do to help them out." 

How does the department pay 
back the l~n? The answer, Perry 
sa id. is ticket sales. 

CurrentJy, football and basket-
ball bring in the largest ticket-sale 
revenue. However, Perry said it is 
too early to tell if ticket sales this 
year will make an impact on the 
deficit. 

"I hope they do well," he said. 
"I don't want the deficit com-
pounding and growing." 

That's where Blaylock and the 
foundation step in.

expenses for travel and scholar-
ships for SDSU's 18 athletic teams,

WOll1en Win Willamette Invite 
ROLUNG: Women runners rule in Oregon; men do too, placing 4th 
By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

Last weekend you might 
have not been up to much . 
Perhaps you rerformed your 
daily ritual 0 jogging, a few 
miles (if you could even man-
age that), or maybe you were 
just sitting around the house 
most of the day, like many other 
sports fans, watching college 
football. 

Whatever the case was, I'll 
bet that less than 1 percent of 
you were up as early as the 
UCSD men's and women's 
cross-country teams were, both 
of which competed in Salem, 
Oregon at Bush's Pasture Park 
on Saturday, Oct. 2. 

If you could have made it out 
to the Pacific Northwest for the 
25th annual Willamette 
University Invitational (which 
began at 8 a .m .), you would 
have seen a fine array of male 
and female UCSD athletes com-
pete marvelously. 

Our women's team finished 
first overall out of 26 schools, 
including Western powerhouses 
such as Northwest College, 
College of Southern Idaho, 
Eastern Oiegon and Humboldt 
State. The men finished in a 
respectable fourt~ place posi-
tion. 

In addition, finishing with an 
outstanding time of 17:48:03 in 

the °S,DOD-meter event, Triton 
Carolyn Jones brought in the 
absolute best mark out of any of 
the women runners from other 
schools in the meet. 

Jones' smoking finish was 
almost a full minute past 
UCSD's No. 2 runner Sarah 
Leonard, who finished at 
18:43:60. Laura Cherdack fin-

ished third behind Leonard with 
a time of 18:51 :42. 

Boded as "the largest colle-
giate cross country meet in the 
west," the competition also saw 
no other runner on the women's 
side of UCSD complete her run 
in over 20 minutes and 30 sec-

.onds. 
Adding to this already 

impressive list of jogging feats 
was the fact that UCSD was 
ranked No. 1 overall out of all 
the schools represented at the 
competition, with a total score of 
72 (the lowest being the best). 
Northwest College trailed rela-
tively far behind in second place 
with a score of 101. The No.3 
school was the College of 
Southern Idaho, bringing in a 
final mark of 121. 

The men's and women's 
teams performances follows a 
strong outing in another invita-
tional on Saturday Sept. 25, 
when the tearns took first with a 
score of 60 and 40, respectively. 
The match that weekend was 
very tough according to Triton 
Head Coach Todd Van Arsdale 
and some team members. 

Likewise, competing in the 
small college/club division, 
the course in Salem was chal-
lenging for UCSD because it 
was on the road and against 
many of Division Ill's top 
cross-country teams. The team, 
however, had the depth of its 
players at its side, which pro-
pelled it to a high status in the 
invitational. 

The top performer on the 
men's side was again James 
Nielsen, with a time of 24:33.81 
in the 8,OOO-meters. Nielsen is 
considered one of the top 
Division-III runners in the 
nation and has paced the Tritons 
so far this year. Behind Nielsen 
was Damian Garcia, who fin-
ished in a time of 25:36.23, I'ust 7 
seconds ahead of Rory C arke, 
who came in third for the 
Tritons. 

Next up for UCSD is a duel 
meet on this Saturday at 9 a.m. 
The match will be held at UCSD 
so get out there and support our 
Triton runners as they attempt to 
upend the Anteaters.

Creatine Use on Rise 
RIPPED: Athletes promote enhancing drugs 
By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

By taking a glimpse into gyms 
all over America, you may find a 
similar fad growing in each facili-
ty: the accelerated use of pow-
dered shakes and colorful little 
pills. At first glance, these might 
seem minute in importance -
unlike other green drugs whose 
odors blow Y9u away and get you 

. into trouble with the canines at 
airports. 

It's best known as Creatine -
by both professional jocks and 
young American males (like skin-
ay 01' Bobby down the street who 
just wants to put on a little brawn 
so he can wrestle with his 
German shepard). 

Often confused with 
Androstene (the junk that base-
ball slugger Mark McGwire con-
sumes by the shovelful), this bio-
logical product is quite safe to 
take. I call it a biological product 
because your body actually pro-
duces it on a daily basis. Without 
trying to insult this fine institu-
tion's human biological dogma, I 
will tell you what this product 
does once it hits your body's 
insides. 

From what a doctor of sports 
medicine at the General Nutrition 
Center in Pacific Palisades told 
me, the stuff simply enhances 
protein synthesis. Proteins build 
muscle, so right after you work 
out, it's good to inundate your 
muscle's cells - which have just 
been broken down by weight-
bearing exercise - with more 
protein or something like 
Creatine, which facilitates protein 
synthesis. As a result, your mus-
cle grows back even stronger. The 
good doctor also told m~ that it 

helps bind water molecules to 
lean muscle, which would 
explain its dehydrating effect on 
the body. Well, the guy was a 
good salesman, and I bought a 
3O-day supply of the stuff, hoping 
to God that taking it for that long 
would build, not diminish, any 
aspect of my health or body (like 
some other illegal steroid forms 
are capable of doing). 

After two weeks of unusually 
intense lifting, probably brought 
on by the psychological effects of 
taking in this "Creatine Fuel," I 
began seeing results. The fact that 
I began to notice results after only 
two weeks should tell you that 
this sUfplement is worth taking. 
Thus, support the use of these 
and other substances used by 
professional athletes who wish to 
enhance their performances and 
statistics. 

McGwire's Androstene, how-
ever, might have negative long-
term effects . on the body. 
Substances such as these should 
be outlawed in professional 
sports. 

With ridiculously beefed up 
muscles, McGwire was able to 
tear apart long-standing records. 
Despite the fact that he has won-
derful vision, his hits land miles 
longer than they did when he was 
punier, playing with the Oakland 
Athletics. Now, although his 
mammoth homers are as exciting 
as a ballplayer'S have ever been 
in major league history, they 
leave just a slightly sour taste in 
my mouth. 

I believe that 40 of Big Mac's 
135 homers were aided in their 
trajectory over outfield fences by 
his Androstene-induced muscles.

Poets Unable to Answer Tritons' Six Goals 
SPEECHLESS: UCSD stumps Whittier as the Tritons shut out their third opponent in a row and seventh on the season 
By IIOIIERT FULTON 

As the saying goes, the pen is 
mightier than the sword. For the 
Poets of Whittier College, howev-
er, not even the mightiest pen 
could have stood a chance at 
stopping the UCSD women's soc-
cer team. 

Dominating by a score of 6-0, 
the Tritons easily blasted Whittier 
at home on Monday. 

At many times, it looked as 
thouJdt UCSD was toying with 
the Poets, berating the opposing 
team with shot after shot as the 
ball generally stayed on the visi-
tor's half of the field. 

"This game they came out and 
stepped it up," Triton Head 
Coach Brain McManus said . 
"Everybody came in and did their 
job." 

Over their last three matches, 
the Tritons have scored an 
unheard of 20 goals w~le not 
allowing their opponents to kick 
a sinlde ball into the back of the 
net. The Tritons seem to be peak-
ing. and it couldn't have come at 
a better time with matches 
against rivals Cal Lutheran 
University and UC Santa Cruz 
right around the corner. 

The Tritons, for the third game 
in a row, jumped onto the score-
board quick and early. 

Off a corner kick, UCSD's 
Lizzy Shilling booted the ball into 
the net at the 1:49 mark for her 
team's first goal. 

"It was a little bit of luck and a 
lot of hard work," Shilling said of 
her team's victory. "Especially on 
a wet field. The ball goes much 
faster." . 

Three minutes later, at the 4:49 
point in the first half, Triton Julia 

Cuder passed the ball to team- With just over 10 minutes left, 
mate Christy Abizaid, who Cuder received a pass from Heidi 
kicked a goal home for her team's Bork to punch a kick in at the 
2-0 advantage. 79:43, putting the lead at 5-0.

but fizzled into uninspired play a message to the other schools," 

Borst said. "This is our last year in 
Division III. We want to go out on 
top. We want to , shut them 

in the second period. "We've been 
winning. but not winning well," 
Abizaid stated. "We came out 
looking for some good goals. This 
was a good win." 

The rest of the first half was 
scoreless, and after a near 61 
'minute drought, the Tritons 
opened up four more g<'als, 
putting the game out of reach for 
the visitors. 

At the 65:48 point in the game, 
Melanie Gephart knocked in a 
pass from Cindy Dostalek to 
increase her team's lead to 4-0. 

Emma Borst scored the first 
of her two goals at the 77:50 
mark off a pass from Lauren 
Jacobs. 

"After the last game against 
Chapman, the second half wasn't 
that good," Borst said of ho::r 
team's all-out inspired play and 
90 minutes of hard work. "AI the 
next practice, we had a chang~ of 
attitude. We refreshed evcry~ne's 
mind [as to what needed to be 
accomplished)." 

down." 
The game could have easily 

been 16-0 had it not been for the 
exceptional shot stopping of 
Whittier goalkeeper Vanessa 
Fanner, who harvested 10 saves. 
She stayed strong in the net and 
made the match at least some-
what respectable. 

Overall, McManus was very 
happy with his team's perfor-
mance . 

... don't think we gave them a 
shot," he said, refernng to Triton 
goalkeeper Jer.nifer Hetland's 
easy day of not needing to make a 
save. "That's what we worked on 
to keep a clear. sheet." 

The Triton;; host their third 
horne p-.me in a row, this time 
welcoming Nazareth College 
from ~ew York. 

"Nazareth has a good team," 
McManus said, whose Tritons are 
now 9-1-1 . "It's a big one." 

UCSD and Nazareth square off 
today at 7 p .m. at the North Field . 
The goings don't get any easier 
for the Tritons after that, as they 
travel to Cal Lutheran University 
on Sunday. That match will go a 
long way in deciding what the 
postseason tournament will look 
like. A win would cement a 
Triton bid to the Regionals. 

It looks like a perfect d.

Men's Soccer Team Avoids Letdown and Cruises to Victory 
FOCUSED: The Tritons push the match against Cal Lutheran to the back of their minds and squash Occidental College 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

A few years back, there was a 
football game between the 
Florida State Seminoles and the 
Notre Dame Fighting Irish. These 
teams were No. 1 and No.2 in the 
country respectively, and the 
Seminoles were an astounding 
21-point favorite. . 

Going into the game, all the 
experts said that the Irish didn't 
have a chance, but Head Coach 
Lou Holtz insisted his team 
was more focused than 
he had ever seen 
them. 

When all was 
said and done, the 
Irish defeated the 
Seminoles and took over 
the nation's No. 1 spot. One 
week later, the Irish lost to lowly 
Boston College and the Seminoles 
eventually went on to win the 
national championship by the 
s limmest of margins, with the 
Irish coming in second. 

The lesson that can be taken 
from Holtz's and his boys? 
Every game is important and 
even a single lack-luster perfor-
mance can ruin an otherwise 
perfect season . 

The men's soccer team took 
this lesson to heart on Monday 
when it faced off against 
Occidental College. After a huge 
victory over Chapman 
University on Friday, the team 
traveled to Occidental College 
with its confidences high and 
players ' thoughts concentrated 
on the year's biggest match, 
next Sunday'S confrontation 
with Cal Lutheran University. In 
spite of the . fact that their 

thoughts may have been else-
where, the Tritons remained 
focused enough to come away 
with a 2-0 victory against 
Occidental. 

"We expected to win," said 
coach Derek Armstrong. "We just 
didn't want to slip up because we 
have been doing so well ." 

The Tritons continued their 
recent trend of solid play with 
staunch defense and a relentless 
attack that could have yielded 10 
goals just as easily as it did two. 

The game remained score-
less until the 24th minute of 

play, when senior Mike 
Sanders broke in 
behind the defense 
and put the ball into 

the lower left corner of 
the goal, past goal-

keeper Efrain Paniagua. 
The half ended with a 1-0 score 

in favor of the Tritons. 
In the second half, UCSD came 

out and peppered Paniagua fur-
ther. In the 51st minute, its efforts 
resulted in the game's second and 
final goal when Brady Bemard 
put one into the lower right cor-
ner. 

The Triton offense was awe-
some, tallying an Olmazing 16 
shots, 10 of which were on goal, 
but the story of the game was the 
defense performed by both sides. 

With to shots on goal, the 
Tritons' total could have been 
quite a oit higher had Paniagua 
not made some spectacular 
saves to hold his team in the 
game. 

"We made a lot of changes and 
got everyone into the game," said 
Armstrong. "So once we got our 
second goal, we were happy." 

On the other side of the field, 

Usa Huff/Guarolan 
INkeS: Junior Brad Munson stops on a dime to avoid a slide tackle in a game earlier this season. 
The Tritons were victorious versus OCCidental College on Monday. 

freshman goalie Ryan Weirich 
started in the first game of his 
young UCSD career. As it turns 
out, it was a good game for 
Weirich to get his feet wet, as 
Occidental could not manage a 
single shot on goal. Armstrong 
praised his young goaltender 
after the game. 

"[Weirich) has been doing well 
in training and has a lot of confi-
dence," Armstrong said . "This was 

a good game to get him into." 
The victory pushed the 

Tritons' record to 7·3-1 and 
lengthened their season-high 
winning streak to four games. 

Next up for UCSD is the match 
that will decide its post-season 
fate: the confrontation with Cal 
Lutheran University. 

When asked about the impor-
tance of this game, Armstrong 
didn't mince words. 

"If we win this weekend, it will 
be hard to keep us out [of the post 
season,]" Armstrong predicted. "If 
we lose, we probably won't get in." 

With all that on the line, the 
Tritons travel to Cal Lu on 
Sunday for a showdown at 3:30 
p.m. The team does not have 
another home game until the fol-
lowing Sunday, when it will com-
pete against NAIA Briar Cliff 
College.

Not the Damn 
Yankees Again! 

...... 

--

In April, every baseball 
team began with 162 games to 
go and a glimmer of hope. For 
some, such as the Yankees and 
the Braves, the regular season 
was simply a formality that 
had to be dealt with before the 
real work began in October. 

For other teams, such as the 
Diamondbacks and the Mets, 
there were serious pre-season 
doubts as to whether or not 
they would still be alive come 
playoff time. 

Now, with all the specula-
tion over and the postseason 
set, only eight teams remain: 
the Yankees, Indians, Rangers, 
Red Sox, Diamo(ldbacks, 
Braves, Astros and Mets. The 
stage has been set for a very 
exciting October in the world 
of baseball. 

I have not made it a secret 
that the lack of a budget, 
small-market team in this 
year's playoffs disgusts me, 
but nonetheless I wait with 
anticipation to see how this 
year's postseason will play 
out. 

Now, with all the arrogance 
that you have grown to know 
and love, I will break down 
the playoffs and tell you, with-
out a doubt, who will still be 
standing when October comes

Massacre at Canyonview 
LAUGHER: With their team back and fully intact, the men's water polo team embarrasses La Verne 
By JOHN MAYNARD 
Associate Sports Edito; 

There wasn't much to 
Wednesday's game against the La 
Verne Leopards . Everyone, 
including Leopards' Head Coach 
Tim Hugar, knew the Tritons 
would win. In fact, everyone 
knew it was going to be a 
washout. And it was. 

UCSD jumped out to a 13-1 
lead by halftime, and 13 play-
ers scored at least one goal 
as the No. to Tritons 
shellacked 
unranked La I 
Verne 20-6 at <=":'';';'''-.,F-
Canyonview Pool. 

Aside from winning its 
12th game of the season, 
Wednesday's romping marked 
UCSD's 54th consecutive win 
over Division III opponents - a 
streak that dates back to 1987. 

But winning Wednesday's 
game and keeping the streak 
alive was unimportant to the 
Tritons. 

"That's a great streak, but 
we' re more about making it to the 
National Championships and the 
Final Four," UCSD Head Coach 
Denny Harper said . 

In fact, Harper said that he 
would have rather held practice 
than have played yesterday'S 
game. 

"We're still recovering from 
the lose of the nine guys who 
were suspended," Harper said. 
"Those guys missed out on an 
opportunity to play in a great 
tournament [last weekend's 
annual SlugFest invitational at 
UC Santa Cruz]. To be honest, I 
think we would have gotten more 
out of a practice." 

Due to the recent suspensions, 
the Tritons had only one day with 
a full roster to prepare for 
Wednesday's game. And in lieu 
of this weekend's huge NorCal 
tournament, getting every player 
on the same page has been 
Harper's biggest priority. 

"Right now my biggest con-
cern i!i whether or not we have 
healthy team chemistry," Harper 
said. "Team chemistry makes 

good, even average, teams 
great." 

Fortunately, 'it 
appeared as if 
the Tritons were 
all heading the 

same direction 
Wednesday. afternoon -

good news for UCSD, who is 
scheduled to face No. 9 UC Santa 
Barbara this Saturday morning. 

"[Wednesday's game] was a 
good game to get the jitters out," 
Team Captain Ross Mecham said. 
"We'll be ready for UCSB this 
weekend ." 

In all, 13 Tritons contributed 
goals including junior Kenny 
Woodruff, who led UCSD with 3 
goals including two, two-pointers

tender for the Final ·Four. 
But long before the NCAAs is 

this weekend 's NorCal tourna-
ment, which brings together an 
elite group of top-ten teams 
including UCSB, Stanford, UC 
Irvine, UCLA, and host UC 
Berkeley. 

This is the exact company 
UCSD wants to be in. Harper said 
his team wants to be challenged. 

"We are always looking to 
play teams that are ranked higher 

than us," Harper said . "It's all 
about over-achieving." 

The Tritons will also use the 
NorCal tournament to gauge 
where they need to be by the 
playoffs. 

"We've got a lot of games 
between now and the NCAAs," 
Harper said. "We hope to be at 
our best by the WWPAs. 

"This is a special team," 
Harper said. "We just need to 
keep hammering." 

Healing with Needles 
Acupuncture makes UCSD training room unique 

Un HuIf/Guan*., 
...... Acupuncture Intern Gina Albanese gives an 
acupuncture treatment on Friday. 

By TRAYIS HILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

Ross Mecham was lying face 
down, motionless on the training 
room table - with about to needles 
sticking out of the back of his leg. 

No, the UCSD water polo super-
star was not being punished for a sar-
castic comment, or even a mistake 
during the team's last game. In fact, 
Mecham was being treated for a knee 
injury - he was receiving acupunc-
ture therapy. 

This year, acupuncture has been 
added to the extensive repertoire of 
treatments that the UCSD training 
room offers. The training room - a 
very modern facility, complete with 
stationary bikes, a whirlpool and 
electronic therapy machines - is 
where all Triton athletes go to receive 
treatment and therapy for injuries. 
By adding acupuncture, UCSD has 
vaulted to the forefront of athletic 
training. 

It is very possible that UCSD is the 
only school in the nation that is com-
bining modern sports medicine with 
traditional Chinese medicine. 

"I don't know of any other 
schools [in the country) that are 
doing this," said Matt Callison, 
UCSD's acupuncture specialist. 
"None whatsoever." 

Callison is the man behind the 

needles. His unique background has 
allowed him to be on the cutting 
edge of athletic medicine. He has 
earned a bachelor of science in 
sports medicine from San Diego 
State University and a master's 
degree in Traditional Oriental 
Medicine from the Pacific College of 
Oriental Medicine in Mission Valley. 
He has spent the last nine years cre-
ating his craft, combining kinesiolo-
gy; sports medicine and Chinese 
medicine. 

His work in acupuncture been 
quite successful thus far; he has per-
formed seminars on his work interna-
tionally and has worked on profes-
sional athletes, including members of 
the Kansas City Chiefs and the 
Minnesota Vikings. Recently, he has 
started working with the San Diego 
Chargers as well. 

Callison is definitely qualified. The 
only question in the training room 
before the 1999-2000 UCSD season 
began was whether or not Triton ath-
letes would be open to receive such 
procedures. Thus far, many have 
been. 

Mecham was not at all opposed to 
the treatment: "Being the adventurous 
spirit that I am, I said, sure, why not?" 

According to Klaiber and Callison, 
around 30 Triton athle.tes have begun
