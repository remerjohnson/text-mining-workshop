CD-ROM 'Campus 
Tours' Offered 
RIVERSIDE - Students and 
faculty at UC Riverside have 
developed a new way for 
prospective students to "tour" 
the campus without leavi ng 
home. Interested students and 
parents will be able to use 
their Macintosh complfters to 
run a CD-ROM disk that 
shows different aspects of 
student life and uses five tour 
guides to take the u er through 
the campus. A disk fo r IBM -
compatable computer hould 
be available next year. 

Purdue Pays 
After Four Years 
PURDUE, ID - In an effort 
to guarentee a four-year 
degree, Indiana Univer ity 
(IU) is consider ing the 
possibility of paying for any 
classes students must take 
after four years to graduate. 
The Indiana Four-Year Path is 
believed to be the first of its 
kind in the country and comes 
with a strict set of cri teria that 
students must meet to qualify 
for the free cia es. Criteria 
inClude approval of cour es by 
an advisor and the ability to 
change majors only once. 
"There is always a shared 
re ponsibility between the 
univer ity and the students, ' 
aid I U President Myles 

Brand. "It's a new idea and 
may not work, but we owe it 
to our elve to give it a look," 
he added. " It 's under explora-
tion bu t not approvcd." 

Toxins Studied 
In Davis Water 
DA VIS - Davis residents 
concerned about low-level 
groundwater contamination 
from radioactive materia ls 
dumped south of UC Davis 
met with clean-up groups last 
month. These groups, includ-
ing UCD, have launched a 
study to determine the extent 
of the contamination at the 
Laboratory for Energy-Related 
Health Research. The contami-
nation occurred from 1960 to 
1989 when scientists tested the 
effects of radiation on beagles 
at the lab. "The [study 1 is 
currently scheduled to be 
completed at the end of 1996," 
said Acting Department of 
Energy Project Manager Larry 
McEwen.

Record Rains Take Campus . 
By Storm Over the Weekend 
By Elizabeth Mackenzie 
Staff Writer 

Torrential rains and ga le-force winds toppled 
trees and caused flooding throughout the state 
and at UCSD during recent storms. 

According to Steve Pyle, superintendent of 
grounds at UCSD, approximately 180 trees on 
campus were felled last Wednesday by the winds 
and rain of the storm that swept across the 
Southern California. Calling the storm the worst 
in the past 10 to 12 years, Pyle said that campus 
received two inches of rain. Matters were com-
plicated by the gusts of wind which Pyle esti-
mated at having speeds of up to 55 miles per 
hour. 

Debris from trees was washed into storm 
drains by rainfall, clogging them and causing 
minor flooding. The saturated ground also left 
many trees susceptible 10 the winds, especially 
the large groves of eucalyptus trees, which do 

not have strong roots. 
Overall , Pyle said he was pleased by the 

response of the Physical Plants Services (PPS) 
to the storm damage. "We were not caught flat-
footed ," he said, adding that many workers 
reported immediately after being called into 
work after regular hours. A few vehicles were 
damaged by falling trees. Some trees and tree 
branches fell across streets, cutting off traffic, 
but Py Ie said that PPS had those obstacles cleared 
away within 30 minutes. 

There was some minor water leakage in 
vaiious buildings on campus, mostly due to 
leaky roofs and high winds that blew water 
through door jambs. 

The storm Tuesday night caused little addi-
tional damage on campus. According .to the 
National Weather Service, San Diego County 

• can<:xpect to receive a respite from the wind and 
rain at least through the weekend.

Budget 
Falls Short 
By Six 
Percent 
PROPOSAL: Governor 
expects 10 percent fee increase 
for UC students next year 
By Karen Cheng 
Senior Staff Writer 

Yet another fee increase may be in store for 
UC students beginning next yea r if Gov. Pete 
Wilson's proposed four-year state hudget plan 
for the Univer ity of California and the Califor-
nia State University is approved by the Legisla-
ture. 

According to the propo al relea ed Tue day, 
both UC and CSU would each receive a two 
percent state ge neral fund increase in 1995-96 
and annual increases averaging four percent for 
the next three yea rs. The plan also calls for 
greater operating efficiencies on the part ofbnt h 
institut ions, higher student fees and increased 
state funding for financial aid. 

This funding increa. e, the first in several 
yea rs, falls far below the 7.9 percent requested 
by the UC Office of the Pre. iden\. According to 
the University of Californ ia Student Associa-
tion (UCSA), the loss offunding will re ult in a 
$100 million shortfall. UC Student Regent Terry 
Wooten stated in a press release that the gover-
nor anticipates that UC fees will rise by at least 
10 percent next yea r. In addition, Kimi Lee, the 
director of field coordination for the UCSA, 
said that professional schools-law, veterinary, 
medical , busi ness and dental-<:ould expect their 
fees to increase to $10,000 in the next five years. 

UC President Jack Peltason aid a revised 
UC budget plan for the upcoming academic 
year, as well as a general budget for the follow-
ing three years, will be developed and presented 
for discu sion at thc UC Board of Regents 
meeting on Jan . 18-20 in San Francisco. 

UCSA will meet this weekend to discuss its 
response to the proposed state budget. "This is 
just a proposal," sa id Lee, "so the Legislature 
still has to approve it. Though we can' t lobby the 
state Legislature ourselves, we will certainly

Founder of IR/PS Will Resign After Nine Years as Dean 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

Peter A. Gourevitch, founding 
dean of the Graduate School of In-
ternational Relations and Pacific 
Studies (I RIPS), announced last Fri-
day that he will step down from the 
post as soon as a new dean has been 
found . 

After nine years at the helm of 
IR/PS, 51-year-old Gourevitch 
stated ina press release that new 
leadership is vital to the growth of 
one of the most prestigious interna-
tional relations schools in the coun-
try. 

.. As I RIPS approaches its second 
decade, it will be faced with many 
new challenges and tasks," 

Gourevitch stated in a press release. 
"I think this is a good time for the 
school to take the next steps in be-
cominga mature institution- bring-
ing on a new dean, taking on new 
perspectives and approaches." 

Former !R/PS Professor 
Chalmers Johnson, a widely re-
spected Japan specialist who left 
IR/PS last year with bitter allega-
tions about: '&Cademic malpractice" 
and "academic incest" against the 
school, questioned the motives be-
hind Gourevitch's decision. 

Johnson said that IR/PS is riddled 
with serious problems and suggested 
that controversies such as the fac-
ulty appointment of IR/PS graduate 
Michael Thies, which prompted him 

and several students to write lellers 
of protest, probably 'played a part in 
Gourevitch's decision. 

In reference to a letter Gourevitch 
sent to alumni regarding his resig-
nation, Johnson said it was "typical 
of the public relations thing going 
on at UCSD." 

"There's not a thing in the letter 
that 's true. There is no mention of 
the imposters on the faculty of a 
school of international relations and 
pacific studies. There is no mention 
of the student protest of the course 
that he required and had taught by 
outsiders," he added, referring to 
the first-year policy-making pro-
cesses course taught by Political

Scripps Researchers 
Starve Cancer Cells 
MEDICINE: New antibodies may cure cancer by 
restricting the blood supply to malignant tumors 
By Ivan Delventhal 
Senior Staff Writer 

began to attract newly formed blood 
vessels, just as they would in hu-

Researchers at the Scripps Re-
search Institution (fSRI) in La Jolla 
have developed a new antibody, 
known as LM609, which they said 
has the potential to destroy deadly 
lung, breast and other caricerous tu-

mans. , 
After 24 hours, some of the em-

bryos were injecled with the anti-
body LM609 and these showed a 
dramatic reduction of tumor-asso-
ciated blood vessels. 

mors. 
The preliminary 

study, conducted by 
Drs . David A. 
Cheresh and . Peter 
C. Brooks, supports 
the premise that tu-
mors can be starved 
to death if they are 
deprived of access 
to a blood supply. 

I n order to grow, 
tumors need a rich 
blood supply to pro-
vide nourishment 
and remove wastes. 

Through a pro-
cess known as 
angiogenesis, a tu-
mor secretes chern i-
cals which promote 
new blood-vessel 
growth in its direc-
tion. The antibody 
LM609 serves to 
disrupt this process. 

"In our experi-
ments, LM609 
blocked new blood-
vessel growth to-
ward tumors," said 
Cheresh. 

"The antibody 
[LM609] tricks 
these newly forming 
vessels into self-de-
struction by interfer-
ing with the survival 
signal ," added 
Cheresh. 

The net resu It of 
the introduction of 
the antibody LM609 
is thalthe tumor fails 
to get adequate 
nourishment and 
begins to die. 

"In our 
.xperlm.nts,

TSRI Researcher· 

Extended treat-
ments using the an-
tibody caused a re-
gression of all lu-
mor types. "The an-
tibody affects a fun-
damental step in 
new blood-vessel 
growth ," 
Cheresh. 

said 

In addition, ex-
periments con-
ducted by TSRI sci-
entists indicate thai 
LM609 apparently 
targets only blood 
vessels entering tu-
mors. 

"All hough we 
haven 't done any 
experim ents in 
people yet, our pre-
liminary experi -
ments suggest that 
there is no effect on 
normal blood ves-
sels," Cheresh said. 

Cheresh expects 
human clinical tri-
als of LM609 to be-' 
gin within the next 
two years, but a 
commercial 
launch of the drug is 
at least five years 
away. 

Ixsys, Inc., a San 
Diego biotechnol-
ogy company, has 
licensed the LM609 
antibody and cre-
ated a "humanized" 
form compatible 
with the human im-
mune system. 

In a study published just over 
one week ago in the journal Cell, 
fragments of human tumors were 
implanted into chicken embryos and, 
within several hours, these tumors 

" We are cau-
tiously optimistic," Cheresh said, 
"But we need to do a lot more test-
ing and basic research. We are just 
now beginning to look at this in 
more sophislicated mOdels."

RESIGN: IR/PS 
reached international 
standing under dean 
Continued from .,.,. 1 
Science Professor Mathew 
McCubbins. 

" If he's got some answers, we 
oughtto hear Ihem," Johnson added. 
"But he shouldn't simply pretend 
like nothjng happened. What hap-
pens at UCSD is thai every time 
anybody complains about anything, 
they never answer - they just go 
silent. " 

Johnson also questioned what 
relationship Gourevitch 's an -
nouncement had with last month ' s 
resignation of Center for U .S.-Mexi-
can Studies' founder and dean, 
Wayne Cornelius . 

Although Gourevitch is out of 
the country, Assistant Dean Jane 
Geddes denied that there were any 
outside motives behind the resigna-
tion. 

"[The Chalmers Johnson dispute] 
really didn ' t have anything to do 
with it," she said. " He had wanted a 
IO-year window, and that 's what 
he 's doing. He wants to go back to 
research and teaching." 

Mark Spalding, a 1992 IRIPS 
graduate and president of the IRIPS 
Alumni Association, agreed with 
Geddes that Gourevitch was "anx-
ious" to get back to teaching, but 
said he felt that last year 's problems 
might have influenced the decision. 

"He didn 't confide in me, but I ' 
strongly suspect that that sort of 
stress and tbose events make teach-
ing again a more attractive option 
for him," Spalding said. He added 

that he did not feel the department 
was in any kind of crisis, however. 

Professor Lawrence Krause, a 
founding member of I RIPS who has 
worked closely with Gourevitch over 
the years, stressed the importance of 
Gourevitch's returo to research. 

"The i nteroational field has been 
a sea change after the end of the 
Cold War," he said. 

"Everyone has to re-establish 
their credentials. My guess is that it 

, is his chance to go back into re-
search," Krause added. 

Gourevitch and several col -
leagues founded IRiPS in 1986 for 
the purpose of crealing an intellec-
tual cenler for research on the grow-
ing economic powers of the Pacific 
Rim. 

As the only school of interna-
tional relations focusing exclusively 
on the Pacific Rim in the country, it 
works to prepare future leaders in 
industry and government for tbe 
challenges facing tbe United States 
during the so-called "Pacific Cen-
tury." 

Under Gourevitch's leadership, 
IRIPS has become one of the pre-
mier graduate schools in the nation, 
listed with Harvard and Princeton 
as a member of the Association of 
Professional Schools of Interna-
tional Affairs. 

The school was designated as a 
national resource center for East Asia 
by the U.S. Department of Educa-
tion last year, bringing recognition 
to IRIPS as a leading center for 
research in this area. 

" I am very pleased with the tre-
mendous progress the school has 
made in such a brief span of time," 
Gourevitch said in the statement.

"A decade ago we were only an 
idea. Now we have more than 300 
alumni working around the globe, 
two dozen outstanding faculty mem-
bers, 200 students, a strong and com-
mitted staff, and excellent research 
activities and facililies." 

"There was nothing here 1 0 years 
ago," Krause said. "The amount of 
detail and creation that 's involved 
in a new graduate school - he put 
everything in place. There is no de-
gree like this in the country, so Ihere 
was no pattern to go by. In many 
ways, I think he was an organiza-
tional genius." 

Gourevitch was appointed dean 
• of IRIPS after five years with the 

UCSD Department of Political Sci-
ence, where he spent three years as 
chairman. Previously he had taught 
at McGill University and Harvard 
University, where he served as acl-
ing director for Harvard 's Center 
for European Studies. Gourevitch 
received his Ph.D. in political sci-
ence from Harvard University in. 
1969. 

In a prepared statement, UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
praised Gourevitch's accomplish-
ments, saying that he has "pro-
vided the vision and leadership to 
make this school oneofthe nation 's 
leading graduate schools of inter-
national relations. Peter has set the 
school on an ambitious course and 
will leave its administration in an 
excellent pos ition for a new 
leader." 

According to Atkinson, a search 
committee forGourevitch 's replace-
ment will be installed next month. 
Geddes said that they hope to find a 
new dean by June 1996.

PINION 
li E D EMOCRATS ARE tN BIG 
trouble. More trouble , per-
haps, than at anytime in the 
last 50 years. This is not just 
hecause of the thrashing 
which they received in No-
vember or the fiery rhetoric 

Thursday, January 12, 19Q5 

COMMENTARY: The Democratic Party Is failing 
apart, both In Its Ideology and In Its membership 

of Newt Gingrich. The problem is almost 
entirely of their'bwn doing, and it has been 
brewing since the New Deal Coalition first 
gave the Democrats the majority status dur-
ing the Franklin Roosevelt administration. 

This control brought committee chairman-
ships, command over policy and legislation, 
and enormous leverage in the corridors of 
power. And most Importantly, it brought 
money. Heaps of money piled to the ceiling 
from hig business, special interest groups and 
political-action comm ittees who had an in-
terest in making sure that decision-makers 
would lend them their car. 

I! also gave the Democrats almost unlim-
ited access to the pork forked over by the fed-
eral and state governments. Democratic rep-
resentatives could count on a new federal of-
fice building, light rail system or· navy ship-
building contract to be given to their home 
districts when the party needed an election-
year boost. 

The Party is crumbling from within be-
cause so few of its members can agree on the 
ideals for which it stands. In everything from 
economic policies to military spending to 
praye r in school, the Democrats stand divided 
from the Party's leaders down to the rank-
and-file memhers. 

The fundamental prohlem with the Demo-
cratic Party is that its members do not share 
si milar world vie~s or ideologies. This is true 
of Democratic Party members throughout the 
country and of their elected representatives. 

With the name recognition which comes 
with incumbency, enormous campaign war 
chests and a lengthy li st of legislative achieve-
ments, the Democrats held on to power for 
over a generation. 

The Republ icans certainly face this prob-
lem as well, and it could well be their even-
tual undoing - no one would argue that 

Despite the grave differences of opinion 
shared by members of the pa rty, Democrats 
recog nized the inherent benefits of staying 
together. 

That, however, is no longer the case. 
North Carolina Sen. Jesse 
Helms and California Gov. 
Pete Wilson have much in 
common - hut for a vari -
ety of reasons, the Demo-
cratic si tuati on is much 
worse. 

In the 1950s, Democrats 
in the Senate included just 
about everyone on the politi-
cal continuum . Jo hn F. 
Kenned y, the energetic 
young war veteran who was 
elected president soon there-
after, and Strom Thurmond, 
the racist curmudgeon who 
battled desegregation tooth 
and nail, had almost nothing 
in common but their party 
affiliation. Thurmond even-
tually became a Republican, 
but the central dynam ic re-
mains unchanged to this day. 

Democratic Sen . and 
Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Sam 
Nunn, who battled President 
Clinton on such iss ues as 
gays in the military and on 
defense cuts, and Scn. Ed-
ward Kennedy, the stalwart 
Massachusetts liheral, are 
prime examples of the enor-
mous tent which is required 
to hold Democrats of all 
stripes.

Democrats

anything.

Since the late 196Os, the 
Democrats have done very 
lillie with their power. The 
enormous policy-preference 
differences among Demo-
crats, especially those in the 
South compared with those in 
the rest of the country, made 
electing a Democratic presi-
dent extremely diffic ul t. 
Southerners increasingly pre-
ferred George Wallace-type 
reformed racists, while other 
parts of the country looked to 
the more liheral wing, char-
acterized by the Kenncdys or 
George McGovern . 

The result has been only 
two Democratic presi dents 
s ince 1968, and they have 
only taken office by narrowly 
beating very unpopular Re-
publicans. 

Because of the lack of a 
visihle Party leader, Demo-
cratic legislators did not have 
to put forward a cohesive na -
tional agenda. As the years 
wore on, they found little to 
agree upon and new policy 
initiatives were rarely pushed 
forward .

COMMENTARY MAKEs QUESTIONABLE CLAIMS 
Editor: 

While sitting down at the Price 
Center, I reluctantly grabbed for the 
UCSD Guardian, expecting to read 
another " liberal paper." As always, 
the Guardian never lets me down. I 
was especially disappointed in the 
type of journalism our "great" school 
has acquired (Derek va n Hoften, 
"The Man With No Pl an or the Great 
Foreign Policy Scam," Nov. 14, 
1(94). 

I became greatly angered when 
the article stated directly that Iran 
is "working to produce nuclear 
weapons," as the United States did, 
and eould still be doing. If this were 
true, the United Nations or Iran 's 
neighboring countries would be the 
fi rst to announce this, not a journal-
ist from UCSD. I stro ngly feel that 
this statement is fabricated. 

I am writing this letter to ask you

In November, with the Demo-
crats in open warfare and the presi-

swept into power. 

Powe r was the glue which held

u.s. Postal Service 
Doesn't Serve Us 
Editor: 

How many of us attempted to use 
the services of our famously "dis-
gruntl ed" postal workers (please 
don' t shlw\t!) last week ? I refertothe 
hi ghway-rnhhery-priced :11 cent 
stamps. Like so many others who the 
U.S. Post Office forces to suhsidize 
their socia li st boondoggle, I naively 
tried to purchase them last week . 
Even worse, don ·tlaugh. I also tried 
to purchase a few 3 ce nt stamps to 
use up my leftover 2'1 ce nt antiques. 

Ha ha. Joke's on us! That morn-
ing, the line at the Uni versity Ci ty 
Post Office ex tended out the door 
and into the rain. Thinking that I 
co uld outsma rt these masters of lost 
and muti lated correspondence. I 

ary nonsense which hankrupted the 
national treasury and huilt a $4 tril-
lion dehl. Increased military spend-
ing, a cut in taxes and a halanced 
budget is impossihle. These propos-
als will only make the deficit worse 
or require the wholesale elim ination 
of many social program currently in 
existence. 

T he Republicans cou ld use this 
time to solidify their posi tions in 
Co ngress, just as the Democrats 
did 50 yea rs ago. Democrats can-
not a llow this happe n without a 
fight. If the Democrats of old do 
not have the wi ll to go to halt Ie, 
then good riddance . Richa rd

Alas, they had no 3 cent sta mps.

glad to see hi m go. 

This loss of power gives the 
Democ rats a window in which to 
wash out the failed poli tics and poli-
ticia ns of the last 40 yea rs . The 
Democrats need to use this oppor-
tunity to co nfront the Rcpuhlicans 
o n everyone of th eir ridiculous 
ideas. It is time to get m(\rally in-
dignant and extremel confronta -
tional. It is essential that the Demo-

is to hand power to the Repuhlicans 
for the next genera tion.

BUDGET: 
Peltason proposes ' 
five percent raise for 
faculty and staff 
Continued from paee 1 
lobby our regents to lobby the leg-
islature. Other than that, I don't know 
what we will do." 

Under the governor's proposal, 
UC would receive $1.89 billion in 
state funds next year for its operat-
ing budget, an increase of $36 mil-
lion, or two percent, overthe current 
year. The University had sought a 
7.9 percentor$145 million increase. 
The proposed budget also includes 
funds to hire 120 new faculty to 
stabilize the UC student/faculty ra-
tion at 18.7 to one. 

Despite continued fee increases 
for students and a limi~ on facility 

improvements, Peltason remains 
positive. "I am gratified by Ihe 
governor's multi-year commit-
ment," he stated in a recent press 
release. "His priority for higheredu-
cation is an exciting signallhat Ihe 
University of California is on the 
rebound." 

"The commitment to a frame-
workforbudgetarystability,coupled 
with necessary student fee increases, 
is a formula through which UC can 
provide students a quality educa-
tion and the classes they need so 
they graduate in four years," he 
added. 

" It means they, and their fami-
lies, also will have a greater mea-
sure of predictability about what 
their costs are going to be." 

Since 1990, Ihe university has 
suffered from a loss in slate funding 
that has necessitated $433 million 

Thursday, January 12, 1995 

in budget cuts since 1990 which 
resulted' in an inability to maintain 
competitive faculty salaries and 
large increases in student fees. 

Wilson also proposed about $160 
million for 1995-96 and $150 mil-
lion for three subsequent years for 
building projects, with attention 
given to seismic, life-safety, infra-
structure and educational-technol-
ogy projects. 

The budget plan called for a five 
percent salary raise for faculty in 
addition to merit increases, as well 
as a five percent pay (aise for staff. 

Peltason said a revised UC bud-
get plan for the upcoming academic 
year, as well as a general budget for 
the following three years, will be 
developed and presented for discus-
sion at the UC Board of Regents 
meeting on Jan. 18-20 in San Fran-
cisco.

showed the kind of offensive force 
she is capable of becoming, consis-
tently nailing a nifty turnaround 
ju mper as she shone in an 18 point 
performance on nine of 11 shooting 
from the field. 

The Tritons were also the ben-
efICiaries of some pinpoint accuracy 
from the three-point arc by junior 
guard Marcia Jeffries who was per-
fect (4 of 4) from downtown. 

"We've got a lot of firepower, 
and a lot of kids that can shoot the 
ball," Malone said. "We just need 
to work on our offense." 

With their current winning streak 
at six, UCSD now stares .down the 
barrel of what is probably the tough-
est portion of its schedule. In their 
next three contests, the Tritons will

RIMAe: UCSD 
loses heartbreaker 
Continued from page 12 

The action see-sawed to start the 
second half, with UCSD and 
Chapman both battling for a lead. 
Triton forward Mike Ensley flicked 
in two nifty reverse layups to pull 
UCSD within three, 47-50. 

A razzle-dazzle breakaway lay-

in by UCSD 's Paul Roberson (S 
points, 4 rebounds) reset the score 
again at 59-all, and at the5:53 mark, 
RIMAC saw its first crowd wave. 

With 2:12 left in the game and 
UCSD in the doghouse with 15 team 
fouls, Allen took over the Triton 
team reins. The forward hit a clutch 
trey and a 1 O-foot jumper with 1: 12 
left to tie the contest at 77. 

But the fun had just begun on the 
newly painted gym floor. With 2t 

seconds left, freshman Jason Barnes 
tossed up a flailing runner that 
wouldn 't go in, sending the game 
into overtime. 

UCSD raced out to a 83-80 lead 
to start the first aT, thanks to big-
time rebounding by Matt Minehan 
(13 points, 5 boards). The crowd of 
2,125 responded, even chanting 
"Moo-Haa" when Chapman 's large 
center stood at the charity stripe. 

The first overtime ended with 
Chapman unable to score in the 
closing seconds, and UCSD again 
took over to start out double-OT. 

II was in this period, however, 
when the impossible happened. 
With the game seemingly over and 
UCSD up by three, Panther guard 
Ramin Bastani did his best Larry 
Bird impersonation. 

Triple-teamed and with a mere 
second on the clock, Bastani threw 
up a one-handed, NBA-distance, 
prayer-of-a-three-pointer to send the 
game into triple-overtime at 96-96 . 

The Tritons ' hopes were 
squashed. UCSD limped through 
the final period to finish 109-102. 

"It was really the experience fac-
tor that did us in," Lanthier said. 
"We're still playing exciting basket-

. ball . All we need is some time to 
get comfortable."

Tritons Soar Past Eagles 
FLY BY: UCSD makes short work of Emory as it gears up for PCSCCs 

. By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

When you have a tradition of 
success like the UCSD swimming 
and diving squad, your performance 
is rated on a higher scale. This year's 
Triton teams are no different from 
those in past years in that a great 
deal is expected of them. 

So far, UCSD hasn't disap-
pointed. Six Triton swimmers quali-
fied for the NCAA Championships 
during the Speedo Cup, which was 
held from Dec. 1-3. 

Sophomore Ed Ruth, who was 
recovering from an injury which 
kept him out of action for the first 
four weeks of the season, didn't 
miss a beat as he cruised into the 
NCAA field with qualifying runs in 
the 200- (1 :55.0) and 400-meter in-
dividual medleys (4:06.6) as well as 
the 200 breaststroke (2:08.2). Join-
ing him on the men's side was Andy 
Hollywood, who breached the 

NCAA standard in the 100-meter 
backstroke with a time of 52.S. 

The women qualified four swim-
mers at the Speedo Cup. Dustin 
Matthew narrowly missed school 
records in the 100- (1:07.7) and 200-
meter (2:25.5) breaststrokes as she 
qualified in both events. 

Co-captain Carrie Parker, ajun-
ior backstroker, stormed into the 
NCAA field with times of 59.7 in 
the 100 and 2:09.3 in the 200. Fel-
low co-captain Christina Galdos 
qualified for the 100 butterfly with 
a time of 59.3. 

Shawna Caballero was the final 
Triton to reach the NCAA stan-
dards. She blazed home with life-
time bests in the 50 (24.7) and 100 
(53.3) freestyles. 

UCSD has just completed its ar-
duous Christmas training session 
which included a number of meets 
against Division I competition and 
the USC Invitational for the divers. 

• 

Ed Ruth has qualified for the NCAAa In thr .. different .vents. 

The USC meet afforded four of the 
six Triton divers the opportunity 
they needed to spring into the 
NCAA meet in March. Senior Josh 
Curtiss and juniors Adam Burgasser, 
Brigiue Elfman and Sheri Takeuchi 
all posted high enough scores to 
earn a trip to the championships. 

"We have a very small team, six 
divers, but we're a very close-knit 
bunch," Head Diving Coach Mike 
Fitchett said. 

After testing their mettle against 
UCLA (Jan. 5) and the Air Force 
Academy (Jan. 3), the Triton swim-
ming and diving crew got a shot at 
a fellow Division III opponent in 
Emory University (GA) on Jan. 7. 
UCSD did not miss the chance, 
sinking the Eagles by scores of133-
93 on the men's side and 145-77 on 
the women's. 

Among the Tritons' standouts 
against Emory were Timothy 
McAteer and his senior partner in 
crime, Michael Jefferson, who per-
formed solidly in the 2oo-meter 
freestyle. The freshman McAteer 
swam another gem in the l00-meter 
free, impressing Head Coach Doug 
Boyd yet again, this time with a sec-
ond-place finish. 

Ruth rocketed through the water 
for a first-place time in the 200 1M, 
and he and senior Erik Pederson 
also impressed in the 2oo-meter 
breaststroke, as the tandem grabbed 
second and third with times of 
2:19.68 and 2:19.73, respectively. 

The women who made their 
mark against the Eagles included 
KeIlie Lusk in the I,OOO-meter 
freestyle (11.21.69) and Galdos who 
performed well in the SO-meter free. 
Caballero destroyed the field in the 
l00-meter free, touching up well

over two seconds ahead of her near-
est competitor with a time of 54.S6, 
while Kemmer showed a spar~ in 
the 200-meter backstroke. 

"[The meet with Emory I was the 
first time we swam well as a whole 
this year," Boyd said. "U's a good 
indication that the training we did 
[over winter break] will payoff." 

The men 's diving duo of 
BurgaSser and Curtiss placed first 
and second respectively in both the 
one- and three-meter diving events, 
to add to the men ',s tally. The 

women's team was boosted by 
Takeuchi's first-place finish in the 
one-meter springboard and team-
mate Kristi Young's top-rated per-
formance on the three-meter board. 

"Diving is definitely a strong 
point on both sides," Boyd said. 

"Since there aren't many Divi-
sion III schools with swimming and 
diving, we get a lot of great compe-
tition from Division I schools like 
UCLA and Berkeley, n Fitchett said. 
"That's why we do really well when 
we get back to the NCAAs."

Who Flinched 
In Hockey? 

Well , here we stand on the 
verge of yet another epic baltle 
for world supremacy in the 
arena of man-to-man, team-to-
team and ego-to-t ras h-talking-
ego which we call the National 
Footba ll League. As usual, this 
year's NFL matchup of 
matchups isn 't in the Super 
Bowl, but rather in the NFC 
title contest which I like to 
refer to as the vi rtual Super 

UCSD AHacked in RIMAe, 109-102 

Bowl. 
If there are three things you 

can count on in life, they are 
death, taxes, and the Super 
Bowl champion bei ng deter-
mined in the NFC title contest. 
In the last few years, one could 
add a matchup between the 
Cowboys and Niners in the 
virtual bowl to the list of life's 
sure th ings. 

Can anyone remember the 
last AFC team to actually win 
a Super Bowl? I believe it was 
the Raiders in 1090 Be. 
Perhaps my colleague who 
presen\ed his theory on the 
unchanging environment of 
athletics was correct. 

But wait, something in the 
world of sports just changed. 
One of the four major sports 
has just done an absolutely 
unbelievable thing. The 
players and owners of the 
NHL have swallowed their 
gargantuan egos and decided 
to drop the puck on this . 
season. That 's right fol ks, this 
is not a misprint, the players 
and owners actually managed 
to agree on something. Has 
somebody called Guiness? 

DEBUT: Tritons fa]) In 
triple-OT to Chapman 
By Tedd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

If you were there, surrounded by 
the fans and the NBA-style arena, 
one question came to mind. You 
looked around, and you couldn 't 
help but wonder: cou ld they top it? 

Well, they did. 
The UCSD men's basketball 

team (6- 10) made its RIMAC de-
but last night, and despite notching 
a heartbreaking, triple-overt ime loss 
to the Chapman Panthers (10-5), 
109- 102, the yo uthful Tr it ons 
outplayed their venue. 

l! was a game in which so many 
things went right fo r UCSD, and a 
game in which - at the end - so 
many things went wrong. 

"Our kids are resilient, H Triton 
Head Coac h Greg Lanth ier said. 
"The win was not as im portant as 
the experience we gained." 

After taking the tip-off, 
Chapman 's enormous 6-8 center 
Stefan "Gigantor" Mumaw led an 
early Panther charge, runni ng up the 
score at 17-5. But a dunk by UCSD 
forward Kahlil Allen (19 points, 9 
rebounds) ignited a Tri ton rally. 

Center Mall Aune (17 points, 13 
rebounds) dominated inside. and 
UCSD closed to within three before 
a Chapman timeout wi th 7:03 to go. 
The Triton hoopsters ro lled into the 
half, thanks to some hot shooting by 
Mark Sebek (1 1 points, 2-5 treys), 
evening the core at 37. 

The NHL players associa-
tion accepted a last minute 
proposal from the owners 
which prevented the cancella-
tion of the hockey season one 
day after it was to be made 
official. Neither side is 
extremely pleased with the 
parameters of the agreement, 
but, fo'r the betterment of the

"This was a fun game to open RIMAC with," 
Head Coach Judy Malone said. "The younger kids 
got time to run the offense and we experimented 
with a few plays." 

Midway through the first half, a short jumper 
by Janessa Bayda staked the Tritons to a com-
fortable 26-8 lead . UCSD never looked back as it 
cruised into halftime with an IS-poirot cushion. 

In the second half, as in the first, the always 
dapper Triton coaching staff gave the lion 's share 
of the minutes to the youthful core of backups 
who did not disappoint. All but one of the UCSD 
hoopsters tallied at least one basket en route to 
the victory.

the finest band to be produced by 
the Louisville, K. Y. scene. 

I. PoIYo: TIl, NIW Dart Agt 
(Merge) . .. EAsily the most under· 

rated band to come out of the 
0Iape1 Hill. N.C. scene, Polvo 
blends the post-punk musings of 
SUperchunk with the ethereal guitar· 
work of Slinl. It's an excellent 
follow·up to last year's T0d4y's 
Actillr Lifestyles. 

.. ...., Va. I III: TIl, 
AIIIIIdIt, Uttdns,. Adv""um 0/ 
AqIMI KiJIy tutd FrillIIls (Cargo 
Headhunter): Over the last four 
years, Heavy Vegetable has gone 
from an eclectic sludge·rock sound 
which merged the best of Mudhoney 
and Pitchfork, to this album's pop 
noise. Hiisker Dii meets Slint sheen 
on Undersea, and it's a fabulous 
genesis. Mark Trombino's produc· 

- tion is superb, perfectly showcasi ng 
both the vocal harmonies and the 
punky bass/guitar/percussion blast 
thai highlights Heavy Vegetable 's 
sound. 

7. HiiIker DU: TIl, Living End 
(Warner Bros.): Recorded in 1987, 
during its last tour, this double live 
album perfectly showcases the blaz· 
ing guitarwork of Bob Mould and 
the songwriting capabilities of d~m­
mer Grant Hart. Its work since then 
pales in comparison. 

I. Hooyer: Tit, Lurid 
Trasv,naJ 0/ RouI~ 7 (Dischord): 
Supercool, heavy at all the right 
moments, TIle Lurid features the 
year's most intelligent Iyries. 

9. Shellac: SlttllGc til Actio" 
Parle (Touch 'n' Go): After \3 years 
of songwriting and production, it's 
amazing to see that Steve Albini can 
still write propulsive and intricate 
tunes. His newest trio (with Polvo 
producer Bob Weston on bass) is no 
exception, and its first full·length · 
studio EP is a pleasure. 

10. 'I'M .............. 
Heet: Liquor in ,"~ Fro"" 
(Interscope): .The first major label 
release by the former Sub Pop 
hillbilly punks shows the difference 
between half·ass and quality pro· 
duction. Ministry's AI Jourgenson, 
who produced Liquor, has made the 
Reverend and his posse sound as 
twisted and magnificent as their 
name suggests.

.Top Movies 
Only four films stood out in 1994 

By C,.., Stokle 
Guardian Reporter 

Another cinematic year has 
come to a close and the ritual istic 
question posed to film critics is, 
"What are 1994's top 10 films?" 
The irony of this question is that 
there weren't 10 great films. In 
1994, cinema didn't rise to great-
ness, it aspired to somatic fluff and 
likable morons, as in Dumb and 
Dumber and Forrest Gump. 

There were a handful of films 
that caught my attention, but none 
were worthy of a "Top Five." 
Hence, this is what my top 10 list 
looks like: . 

',',1,4. None: No film stood 
above the rest. Films like 
Unforgillrn, NakLd and 'T'Iu! Re· 
mains of 1M Day were worthy of 
high distinction, but they were not 
released in 1994. 

L ..... (JM): The fifth best 
film of the year is reserved for one 
of the unrel~ and just· released 
films of 1994 (ImmorIllIBeIO\led, 
'T'Iu! Sofe Passage. Tom and Vi" 
and Legends of tire FaU), in hopes 
that one will attain greatness. 

.. 'I'M Hu ••• JcIc. Pro.,: 
The Coen Brothers' film, starring 
Tim Robbins,Jennifer Jason leigh 
and Paul Newman, is rich in fun 
and details. The dialogue always 
pulls a gag.like punch. and Paul 
Newman was on the money as the 
ruthless Sydney Mussbcrger. 

7. DnIIlIt_ ...... I:Jackie 
Chan. the maestro of ~ong Kong, 
makes any American action film 
look like a saunter through a 
meadow of stunt doubles and digi. 
tal effects. Amidst all the action. 
this film is hilarious, withJackie(at 
40 years old) playing a mischie· 
vous son to his mother (played by 
29·year-<>ld actress Anita Mui). 

....., Kelt ...... Qu_tIn , • ..uno try to til ..... of ...... 
body .. , ......... ,."", FIctIoII. 

.. FMtb: This film follows a 12·. 
year-<>Id boy who sells drugs for a 
wealthy druglord. The realistic movie 
shows some rare restraint by not bang-
ing the viewer over the head with 
moralization or glorification. 

I. PIlIp FIctIon: For many, this 
was the top choice for film ofthe year. 
Thedialogucmadethisfilmacharmer. 
Tlrantino proves himself to be a good 
monkey·wrench (surprise plot tum) 
thrower. Still, the dialogue at the 
Hawthorne Grill grew wearisome, in 
spite of a robbery and Bible quoting. 

10. Iu .... Over ........ 
Woody Allen's film about gangsters 
and playwrights is mediocre but rises 
to greatness when Chazz Palminteri is 
on the screen and during the final 
scene. 

Last year's worst films were much 
easier to choose. Ten films are worthy 
of being on the list, but I will only 
make note of five. 

1. .... ., P'aIroIotMn: Alex 
Cox, the director who brought us Sid 
and NIJIIC)' and Repo Man, went a 
little too far with deadpan this time. 

2. ~ This sci·fi fantasy 

film brings cliches to a . new high. 
Examples include: the platoon of im· 
patient soldiers, masses of ill iterate 
indigenous people and strange food 
("it tastes like chicken"). Director and 
writer Roland Emmerich (Universal 
Soldier) makes so many bad choices, 
that he almost makes the film enter-
taining. 

I. litter Moo.: Roman 
Polanski's over·the·top film is funny 
for 30 minutes but is painfully dull for 
another 90. The film ends.llP feeling 
like. bad "Saturday Night Live"skit. 

4. ForI .. a....: This film is 
not bad - it is scary. Zemekis nicely 
packages America's recent history into 
one big. classic rock video that essen· 
tially thumbs its nose at the events it 
covers. Hanks is likable as the well· 
meaningdim·wit, but the film ends up 
being epic fluff stuffed in the viewer's 
face (remember the feather at the end, 
filling the screen). 

I. .. .., IItee: Ben Stiller 
attempts to make a film that addresses 
people in their 2Os, but ends up mak· 
ing a film that is formulaic, with card· 
board cutouts of so-allcd slackers.

Beck opened for lohnny Cash at the Pantages Theatre. 

Johnny Cash 
Concert with Beck at Pantages 
shows the Man in Black is back 

By Jeff Nlesel 
Hiatus Editor 

The pairing of country singer 
Johnny Cash with 23-year-old singer 
. Beck, who emerged from the Los 
Angeles coffeehouse scene last year 
with his hit "Loser." may seem likean 
odd coupling. Yet, at the Pantages 
Theatre in Los Angeles on Saturday 
night, Beck and Cash showed more 
similarities than differences. Both pre-
sented themselves as masculine, re-
bellious rockers- "hadalises" to use 
Beck's phrasing. 

Cash's appeal to young listeners 
has been fermenting for several years. 
Social Distortion's cover of his "Ring 
of Fire" in \988 was one sign that 
punk and Cash's explorations of his 
darker side are not at odds with each 
other. Cash's acclaimed performance 
at last year's South hy Southwest con-
ference in Austin. Texas. a showcase 
for independent hands, showed he 
could appeal to young crowds . 
Saturday's c<)ncert, which was filmed 
for televised hroadcac;t at a later date. 
represented the culmination of Cash 's 
resurgence. 

The audience at the Pantages 
(which included Tom Petty, Henry 
Rollinsand producer Rick Ruhin)wa<;, 
for the most part. in the 20-35 age 
group. It was remarkahle to hear Cash 
silence Ihe crowd when he somherly 

Slayer

While metal hands such · as 
Metallica and Megadeth have traded 
in their hard-edged sound to appeal to 
.hroader audiences. Slayer has re-
mained rc1entlessly true to its rool'i. 
The furiously paced DiI'ille IlIlen'ell-
lioll. Slayer's first alhum in four years. 
hearkens hack 10 1<)86's Reigll ill 
B/{)()(J.I n thesong"213." Slayer makes 
gruesome references to Jeffrey 
Dahmer, showing Ihal its lyrics are 

recited the opening lines to "Re-
demption," which essentially con-
sislliof a prayer. It was a testament 
to his stage presence, and to the 
reverence which young fans hold 
for him, that Cash was ahle to 
voice such traditional beliefs. 

Joined hy hoth his wife, June 
Carter, and his son, John Carter 
Cash, Cash played over 30 songs, 
spanni ng his career of 40 years. 
He performed most of the material 
on his recent Americall Record-
illgs, which was produced hy 
Ruhin. Recordillgs is a sparse al-
hum, consisting of Cash's reso-
nant vocals and acoustic guitar. 
Du ri ng h is two-hour performance, 
Cash showed that he doesn't need 
much to command an audience's 
attention. Backed hy a four-piece 
hand, the arrangements were 
simple, designed to let Cash's sto-
ries of temptation and redemption 
stand on their own. 

Beck, who didn't perform any 
songs off his Mel/ow Gold alhum 
(which contains the hit "Loser"). 
displayed his love fot folk music.

and harmonica. Beck was enter-

Yet, the song "Ditto head." 

which sides with conservatives like 
Rush Limhaugh who argue that 
the moral value of our country is

ahout moral decline from Slayer is 
somehow more satisfying than lis-

rades. 

Slayer will perform with Ma-

p.m. today at Croshy Hall at the 
Del Mar Fairgrounds.The date is

Thursday. January \2. \ 995 

. By Mike Martinez 
Contributing Writer 

Tire Oscar: \ %6. Director Russel 
Rouse. With Stephen Boyd. Elke 
Sommer. Tony Bennett. 

Camp: n. Something so outra-
geously artificial. affected, inappro-
priate or out-of-date as to he consid-
ered amusing. 

Camp is the essence. the aesthetic 
ali it were, of this new liialUS space 
filler. -A look at camp films. camp 
music. camp TV. camp whatever. A 
celehration of had tao te in the arts. 

Sometimes a creative work is so 
thoroughly wretched that the 4uality 
and sheer tenacity of il'i s4ualor is 
4uite an achievement. It's a fine line. 
though. Merely had. as in horing or 
lackluster. doesn ' t cut it as high camp. 

Camp must have a certain indefin-
ahle something. For a cultural touch-
stone. look to Tim Burton's film Ed 
IVlXXI. That was a celehration of camp. 
of kitsch. The protagonist, Ed Wood. 
Jr. , was technically the most inept 
film director of all time. In hi. films. 
falling hodies hit mattresses clearly 
seen in the frame. Fluhs in the dia-
logue arc. oh what the hell. left in the 
final cut. This is great camp. 

Another example is that great song 
stylist of yesteryear. Annette 
Funicello. who hil'i such a clam that 
even she feels compelled to . tep hack 
andexclaim"Whoa!" And her record 
producer left Ilral on the final cut. 

More great camp. 
Now that you get the idea. let 's 

kick things off with a look at Tire 
Oscar. There arc many other worthy 
inaugural candidates, hut this 1966 
film is certainly a'i ludicrous and dread-
ful as any ever produced. It's the story 
of a snake named Frankie Fain 
(Stephen Boyd) and his hac.khiting 
trip up the Hollywood ladder. 

"Here you sit on top of a glass 
mountain called success." hissesTony 
Bennett in the film's opening. Tire 
Oscar slarted out with all the makings 
ofa pothoiler. hut the ahsurd dialogue 
moves it into the Pantheon of c.amp. 

The had lines in a had movie often 
slip right on hy. perhaps eliciting a 
hrief upward roll of the eyehalls. The 
clinkers in this film plop with an au-
dihle thud, and they sit there with all 
the grace of a cheese steak al a state 
dinner. These cliched American idi-
oms arc made all the more ridiculous 
hy Boyd 's vague Balkan accent and 
the wooden readings of Bennett and 
Elke Sommer. 

Regarding the dirty politicsof show 
hiz. a studio head laments. "Once in a 
while you hring me meat like this. It 
all has different names: prime rih of 
Gloria. shouldercut of Johnny Meat! " 
It's fortunate Tony Bennett could fall 
hack on his singing. His n,lOe-too-
convincing delivery of lines such as 
"You lie down with pigs and you 
come up smelling like garhage" en-
sured that Tire Oscar was his first and 
last film role. 

This is one of those movies that 
has to he seen (and heard) to he dishe-
lieved. II may he hard to find at Block-
huster. hut do scour the TV Guide for 
this one on TNT.
