Medical school to 
run diabetes study 

The UCSD School of Medicine 
and Medical Center have been 
selected to participate in a major 
clinical study to determine the 
most appropriate treatment for 
insulin-dependent diabetes. 

Twenty-seven centers in the 
United States and Canada will 
participate in the Diabetes 
Control and Complications Trial 
(DCCT) funded by the National 
Institute of Health. UCSD is the 
only Catifornia center chosen for 
the trial. 

The UCSD center, funded with 
more than $2.4 million from the 
National Institute of Anhritis, 
Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney Diseases (NIADDK), will 
enroll 40 individuals with 
insulin-dependent diabetes in 
the seven-year study. 

The long-range efficacy of 
these twO approaches has not 
been compared in a controlled 
manner. Thje DCCT will follow 
1,400 volunteers across Nonh 
America for several years , with 
data compiled at a central 
coordinating center in Bethesda, 
Maryland. 

The UCSD-DCCT is currently 
screening individuals for 
participation in this study. For 
more information on the study 
call (619)534-5463. 

Debate and lecture 
on space 

Four promment figures In 
space exploration - including 
James Van Allen , the physicist 
who discovered the rwo mtense 
belts of radiation that encircle 
the Earth - will debate the 
value of manned versus 
unmanned space missions on 

ov. 19 at the University of 

BLOOM COUNTY 

California. an Diego. 
The controver ial issue , 

reopened by the tragic explosion 
of the space shun\e Challenger 
last January, will be examined in 
a public forum entitled "The 
Future of Man In pace." The 
forum, presented by UCSD's 
Center for Astrophysics and 
Space Sciences (CASS) and 
funded by the William F. Marlar 
Foundation, will be held at 7:30 
pm in Room 108, Peterson Hall. 

Joining Van Vall en on the all-
star panel will be Thomas Paine, 
who led NASA during the first 
seven Apollo expeditions and 
chaired the recent Presidential 

ational Commission on Space; 
Noel Hinners, director of NASA's 
Goddard Space Flight Center in 
Greenbelt . Maryland; and James 
Arnold . director of UCs 
California Space Institute and the 
Harold Urey, Professor of 
Chemistry at UCSD. The 
moderator will be the 
distinguished oceanographer 
William lerenberg director 
emeritus of Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. 

CASS is presenting the forum 
in conjunction with its annual 
Marlar Lecture. which will feature 
a talk by Van Allen entitled 
"Forry Years of Space PhYSics." 
The lecture wil be held at 4 pm. 
Nov. 18 in the Mandeville Center 
Recital Hall . Both events are free 
to the public. 

The Marlar Foundation was 
named for Will iam Marlar, a 
Denver philanthropIst with a 
deep interest in United States 
space science. In addition to the 
annual lecture at UCSD, the 
foundation sup pons a UCSD 
graduate fellowship in space 
science and acquiSitions for the 
CASS Library of Space Science 
and Astronomy. 

Philosophy dept. 
screening film 

The Philosophy Department is 
screening the ftlm "Please Let Me 
Ole" at 4 pm on Weds., Nov. 19, 
In the orlh Conference Room. 
Professor tephen Stich will 
speak afterwards on the flIm , 
whIch deals with euthanasia and 
was flImed at the UniverSIty of 
Texas at Galveston's Medical 
School. Refreshments will be 
served. 

Poet David Ignatow 
is Regent's lecturer 

American poet David Ignatow 
will be a Regent'S Lecturer In the 
Literature Department at UCSD 
from November 17-22. His 
papers and manuscri pts were 
recently purchased by the 
Archive for New Poetry in the 
Mandeville Department of Special 
Collections. 

Ignatow, considered O:1e of 
America's most distinguished 
poets, wrote his first book, 
Poems , in 1948 and his latest 
book, Selected Poems, was 
published this year. 

Scripps studies 
Greenland Sea 

Scientists at Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography will be using 
sound waves to measure how 
seawater circulates in the deep 
ocean during a four-year, $2 
million study funded by the 

ational Science Foundation. 
The investigation is part of a 

nine-nation program to observe 
in detail the interactions of the 
atmosphere , ice, and ocean in 
the Greenland Sea, a region that 
links the Arctic Ocean and the 
North Atlantic. The Scripps 
group, whic h 'includes Drs. 
Walter Munk, Peter Worchester, 
and Robert Knox , will work with 
scientists from the Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institution to 
study the movement of cold 
arctic water as it travels through 
the Greenland Sea into all the 
world's oceans.

Riley gives speech 
on state of campus 
By MARC FLEISCHMAN 

I N keepi.ng . his pr~mise to maintain an open line of communication and mform students of AS. activi[)" President RIley made the first of his "State of the Campus" addresses at 
noon last Wednesday in front of a small crowd of students on 
Revelle plaza. 

After initiating his speech with a calendar of upcoming 
intercollegiate athletic events, Riley's focus was turned to 
bureaucratic and academic affairs of campus. Among the 
bureaucratic topiCS touched upon was the action being taken by the 
AS. to "form an ad hoc parking committee to get more student input 
on the parking situation." 

This committee would look into and receive student input on 
alternative peripheral parking, the ratio between student and staff 
spaces, and the continued use of quarter-only parking meters. 

Riley also discussed an alternative hOUSing proposal that is to be 
submitted to Vice-Chancellor Watson sometime this year. The 
Alternative Housing Study Committee will be drawing up the 
proposal which will include bringing into existence fraternity and 
sorori[}' houses as well as minori[}' and co-operative housing. • 

The primary academic affair [Cuched upon in the delivery was 
the pub~ishing of the Smelser report. The report is being put Out by 
the Cahfornia Department of Education in order to evaluate the 
quality of undergraduate preparatory education in bOth Universi[}' 
of California and California State Universiry schools. Improved 
teaching assistant tra ining and a precise evaluation of professors 
are two measures that will be looked into by the report. 

Riley concluded his speech by asking for students to let him 
know what they think about the AS. and to take advantage of his 
visibi lity. When asked afterward s how the address went, he 
commented , "1 thought it went very well . It was informative and well 
received. I did feel, however, that the turnout co uld have been 
better. But again, this was the first and it wasn't massivly 
publicized ." 

The next "State of the Campus" address will be December 3, and 
there will be a great deal more pUblicity. ~

UCSD scientists discover 
method for tracing genes 
By PETER MESSROBIAN, StaffWri/er 

A powerful new DNA The plant is then watered microbiological tool was with a special chemical also i;t unveiled recently at flrelhes called luclfenn. It begms 
UCSD. to glow. 

Part of the luciferase gene. The light, which is visible in a 
which produces light in fireOies, dark room, and emanates from 
was placed between the start- all parts of the plant, tells 
stop signals on a plant virus. The ·researc hers that the luci fcrase-
VIruS was then introduced into a Impregnated gene is in its active 
tobacco plant using tandard state. 
recombinant DNA procedures, Dr. Stephen H. Howell , plant 
thus making it pan of the plant's biologist and professor of biology 

The luciferase experiment fused the gene that lights fireflies to a tobacco gene to 
produce a plant that glows In the dark. . 

at UCSD, directed the work of 
actually recombining the virus's 
DNA with the plant's DNA and 
ca lled the results "quite 
spectacular. The gene was not 
expected to operate in plams," 
he said, adding that this is an 
"important scientifIC discovery 
enabling us to genetically map 
out the plant." 

As Dr. David Ow, a POSt-
doctoral fellow he re , and one of 
thIS project's researc hers 
explained. "ThIS was Just a test 
to see if the recombination 
worked because this virus is 
always on (active) and should 
therefore always glow; next we 
WIll test other genes." He 
compared thIS experiment to 
tesung the hghtbulb on a 
flashlight . saymg that now they 
know how "the bulb works. (and 
they) want to test different on-off 
switches (different genes)." 

One example of genes [har 
they are begmnmg to test is the 
carboxylase gene . whIch grabs 
C02 out of the aIr 0 the plant 
can use the carbon to make 
glucose, which plants and 
animals use to make energy Also 
being studied IS the tobacco 
plant's response to wounding, 
which consists of producing a 
substance that makes insects SIck 
when they eat the plant, thus 
preventing funher damage. 

Dr. Marlene DeLuca announces the Invaluable discovery of the luciferase gent 
In the genetIc mapping of plants. 

Dr. DaVId HelinskI. a 
molecular geneticist and the 
Director of the UCSD Center of 
Molecular Genetics, explained 
the imponance of the work: "It IS 
nor a dramatIC breakthrough :n 
terms of a new understanding of 
the cell , but rather a very 
powerful tool I hope scientist s all 
over the world will use By 
hooking up the luclferase gene to 
whatever you WIsh to ~tudy , you 
can tell when th,1t gene I turned 
on and off," he saId . 

He saId the gene can be used 
as a replacement for radIOactive 
tagging III many cases, thus 
cit mi na!1ng the dangers 
asso lated WIth that techntque . 
Hehnskl also added thIS 
techntque "will be of great 

Importance to the biotechnology 
Industry as well as other 
UniversIty research labs." 

Dr \1arlene Deluca, a 
hlochemlst and professor of 
chemIstry at UCSD dIrected 
research aImed Jt prodUCing 
IJrge amounts of the luctferase 
gene in the Iaboratol)'. "It took us 
nine months to successfull), 
clone the gene ." she satd, "and 
the speed of the work IS J 
testimony to ha\1ng all the labs 
Involved in the research on one 
ampus." 

Similar research with the same 
goal of mapping gene exp ression 
is bei ng done at UCSD, the 
difference is that luciferase is 
being combined wi th monkey 
and human cells In culture . ~

CHINESE CIVILIZATION 
RELIGION AND SCIENCE 

Winter Quarter 
Chinese Studies 18 (also listed as History 28B) . MWF 1:00 

Professor Suzanne Cahill 

This cOl,lrse inrroduces !he field of Chinese studies. The class will investigate 
Chinese cultural patterns in order to understand what makes China and the 
Chinese people special. Our survey will concentrate on the past, emphasizing 
elements of rraditional China that survive today. During the winter quarter we 
will focus on Chinese religion and science as essential parts of Chinese culture. 
We will examine the main characteristics of Chinese religion and science to 
show how the Chinese have experienced and explained heaven and earth, and 
human beings. 

In our study of Chinese religion and science, we will read a broad range of 
materials, including both primary and secondary sources. Class meeting will 
consist of lectures and discussions of the reading, supplemented by s lides and 
films . There arc no prerequisites. There will be a midterm, a short term paper 
or project and a final. 



The writing on the wall 
I TS already past five (o'clock). I'm in my office stuffing my briefcase 10 take some 
work home , when I hear a 
commotion out In the corridor 
by the elevalOrs near my office 
door in H&'SS. I go OUI there 
and find a middle-aged professor 
and a young woman. He is 
berating her in a loud vOice. He 
has caught her in the act of 
contributing to the graffiti on the 
walls of the stairwell. She doesn't 
deny it. We've got 10 live in this 
building, he shouts at her. He 
looks to me for moral support. I 
cringe, withdraw. He continues 
to berate her, very agitated. She 
is i1ent, looks as if she'd rather 
be somehwere else . What's 
wrong with you. he shouts at 
her; don't you have any 
consideration 1 The elevator 
arrives, door opens. She starts to 
get Into the elevator. He reaches 
for her forearm to restrain her. 
Leave me alone . she says. I'm 
making a citizen's arrest. he says. 

The three of us get into the 
elevator. It sta rts down , stops at 
the 6th floor, another colleague 
gets in. The indignant professor 
continues to berate the young 
woman , this time looking to the 
other professor for moral 
support. He reacts as I do: silent, 
neutral. The citizen-policeman 
and the young woman walk off 
in the direction of the sun-god. 

I give this account of the 
incident for a few reasons. For 
one. it touches a lot of sub de 
issues about law, order, 
sanctions , ci\~lity, indignation. 
de\~ance, and such . More 
important to me, perhaps, is the 
fact that I found myself ashamed 
of my passi~ty . Still more 
important is the fact that I'm not 
sure whether I was ashamed 
because I withheld my moral 
suppOrt from the indignant 
professor (who sought it) or from 
the young woman (who did nor). 

Appealing to the law is not 
much help here . We have a law 

limiting automobile speeds to 55 
MPH, which almost no one 
obeys, and who e violation 
makes almost no one indignant. 
We also have laws against 
murder, which almost everybody 
obeys, and whose violation 
evokes a lot of shared 
indignation . Where, on the scale 
of illegality and indignation , 
writing on the walls of public 
buildings belongs is, I suppose , a 
maner of opinion . Many of us 
aren't even aware of what the law 
is when it comes to fine details. 

You see the point. I don 't want 
to defend graffiti. I've on 
occasion been offended by it 
myself. But I did find the 
magnitude of the offended 
professor's i ndignance bizarre. I 
was embarrassed for both of 
them. Maybe he saw the writing-
on-the-wall as just the tip of an 
iceberg under which he 
envisioned sex, drugs , treason , 
disorder. chaos, and the decline 
of westem ci~li zation . If that's 

the case, then perhaps the 
inten:,ity of his outrage is 
understandable . If not, it seems 
at least an overreaction , if not 
actually bizarre. 

How serious a misdemeanor is 
writing on the walls of public 
properry? I honestly don't know. 
I wouldn't defend anybody's right 
to do it; public buildings, after 
all, are in the hands of duly 
constituted public authorities. 
When the stairwells in H&5S 
were painted about a year ago, I 
must con fess that I initially 
missed the graffiti. It seemed to 
me authentically expressive -
something usually missing in 
student exams and term papers. 
What it expressed was usually 
callow and sometimes coarse, but 
never obscene; student graffiti. 
After the new coat of paint, the 
cold, bare walls highlighted the 
brutal weight of Muir's concrete , 
and there was something vaguely 
ominous and threatening about 
those harsh , echOing, empty 
stairwells that the human touch 
on the walls seemed to - well 
- moderate. But that's only my 
view of this graffiti in that place; 

as I said , some graffiti does 
offend me and I don't think 
anybody has the right ro deface 
public property without the 
prospect of some sanction . 

Still, between the law and its 
punishments there exist large 
gray areas where good sense, 
proportion . and "civility" ought 
to prevail. I don't know what 
satisfactions accrue to graffiti 
writers, and I don 't know what 
satisfactions accrue 10 punitive 
and indignant professors who 
catch law-breakers red-handed 
(or in this case black-handed). I 
think I had more sympathy for 
the young woman than for the 
professor-cop because her 
delinquency is less profoundly 
ominous than his punitive 
righteousness. But that roo is a 
maner of which not everyone 
\~II agree. The only thing I feel 
certain about is that there was 
no honor in any of it. I regret 
that I was a passive \~tness to it. 
It continues to trouble me. What 
would you have done? rr:;)

Mac, the boys, and free speech 

Editor: 
I am writing In response to 

the letter of November 13 by 
Greg MacCrone. et al. First I 
would like to give my support to 
Arnie Schoenberg and the other 
leftist that Greg is attacking -
the sometimes overzealous 
actions of the left are far 
preferable to the callous 
indifference that the nght shows 
towards other human beings. 

Secondly, I wish to express my 
amusement at several aspects of 
Greg's letter. For Mr. MacCrone 
- the person recentl), 
reprimanded for assaulting a new 
indicator representative simply 
because he didn't agree with the 
stands of the paper - to accuse 
others of infringing on others' 
rights IS aSinine. Which is more 
of an Infringement, assault with 
fists or throwing paint on a 
banner? Both may be wrong, but 

Greg's action was violent and 
childish . Another amusing point 
In Greg's ra~ngs was his claim 
to be representing the "silent 
majonry" at UCSD. Personally. 
most of my friends find the 
politiCS of Schoenberg quite 
agreeable , albCll somewhat 
overenthUSiastic In action. I 
claim to represent only myself 
and my experiences; but I find 
htde attraction in the self-
righteous , VIOlent and often 
callous polICIes of the 
conservatives. 

To Arnie - a more mellow 
approach to the same goals 
would have my full suppOrt. To 
Greg - until you can control 
your own violent temper I 
suggest you shut up and stop 
claiming that you represent any 
sort of a majority. Your letter was 
nothing but hypocrisy and

United States intervention in 
Central America, our government 
is rapidly intenSifyi ng its illegal 
intervention. Nevermind that the 
country that pretends to be free 
is the country that helps racist 
South Africa undermine the 
frontline states of Southern Africa 
(e.g., through aid to UNITA). 
Neverrnind that it is the country 
that loves dictators who love 
mu ltinationals; that it is the 
country that murders people for 
pursuing their political freedom 
in Central America and the 
Caribbean . Neverrnind that the 
country that allows you to be free 
might blow up your world any 
day. Nevermind that its women 
eam a little mbre than half of 
what its men earn. Nevennind 
that its people of color have yet 
to find equality. Well, if we are 
all fre e, I guess it means that rich 
people are freer. I guess it means 

that white-skinned people are • 
freer. I guess it means that men 
are freer. 

The only time this country 
upholds "freedom" is when it is 
in its own self-interest to do so. 
Free speech is free as long as it 
is ineffective. It is an innocuous 
give-away to quell dissent while 
channelling opposition into 
acceptable forms of beha~or. 
Someone said this about voting. 
but it applies to "free speech" as 
well ... "If it changed anything, it 
would be illegal."

Student regent discusses 
his role on the Board 

Academic Senate ranges from 
very Ii nle to non-existent. The 
Senate , With a division on each 
campus, is the policy-making 
body that decides key issues 
such as academic and research 
sta ndards, curriculum make-up 
and va rious institutional goals 

presence on the board is a 
blessmg for both the individual 
tudent Regent and for all U.c. 

students. According to Woodard, 
"The Student Regent is a voting 
member of the regents. They 
attend all the meetings, they 
serve on committees. Prio r to 
commencement of their term , 
they are a Regent des ignate and 
will sit for those months on the 
Board (as well) .... They make 
motions , they can submit 

' regential items. They are called a 
Student Regent, but they are 

By LlLYS MCCOY 

STUDENT REGENT David Hoffman wants students to be heard , and he wants 
them to be represented . 

From the Board of Regents on 
down, Hoffman wants to use his 
influence as a one-year Regent to 
increase student voice 
throughout the University of 
California system and affect 
positive change for the 
undergraduate population . 

The youngest to serve on the 
prestigious Board of Regents , 
Hoffman, a junior at UCLA, was 
selected from 71 applicants to 
represent the 148,000 collegians 
in the University system . • 

Regarding his powerful office, 
Hoffman remarked: "The student 
has a really different perspective 
to offer. The sorts of 
contributions that I've been able 
to make to the Regents have not 
just been different in opinion , 
bur have been different in 
perspective and I think that is 
the way the Student Regent can 
be effective and helpful in the 
process." 

T he position of Student Regent 
is one of 28 on the U.c. Board 
of Regents. The Board is the 
central body of policy making for 
the University. Its membership 
includes 20 citizens who are 
usually individuals within the 
California business community, 

seven ex officio (non-voting) 
members, among them President 
David Gardner and Governor 
George Deukrnejian, and one 
voting Student Regent, Students 
have had a representative on the 
board since 1975, one year after 
Califomia voted to change the 
U.c. constitution to include a 
Student Regent. 

According to Randy Woodard , 
UCSD's Campus Contact and 
Coordinator for the Student 
Regent program, "The University 
of California Student'S 
Association ( then known as the 
Student Body President's 
Council) demanded that a 
student be a pan of the decision 
making process in 1974 .... The 
Regents set the policy of the 
Ur.iversity ," Woodard said, "they 
appOint the chancellors, the 
President, and the directors of 
the research centers. They 
establish all the policies of the 
campus relating to Affirmative 
Action , student needs, minority 
recruitment, admissions, and 
financial aid. The bottom line ,'-
he concluded, "is that the 
Regents are the University." 

The eleven year old Student 
Regent position has grown and 
changed since its inception, 
according to Hoffman, a political 
science and economics major. 
"At the time. it was basically the 

end of the evoluti on of student 
participation , Student 
participation evolved in the 
1960s and early 1970s, and we 
were given a lot more power to 
participate than we'd ever had 
before. The Student Regent 
position was seen by a lot of 
people as the ultimate extension 
of that." With student 
representation finally in place, 
the Regents enjoyed more 
legitimacy as a governing body. 
Said Hoffman , "It's a lot easier to 
convince a group of people (in 
this case, U.c. students) to 
accept a decision enforced upon 
them if they feel that they 
participated in the process." 

Although the Student Regent 
still fulfills that role of legitimist , 
such as in the Divestment issue 
where a great amount of pressure 
was put upon the Regents by 
students to act in accordance 
with their demands, Hoffman 
believes it has taken on a more 
substantial dimension . "Although 
it probably wasn 't imporrant 
when they initially created the 
poSition ," he said, "they have 
come to realize that the Student 
Regent has been helpful in the 
acrual decision making process 
and not just a way of defUSing 
student unrest." 

Ho ffman noted the fact that 
student representation on the 

"There are a lot of times where 
student participation on some 
issues, pallicularly academic and 
curriculum issues , is really 
desireable," he began. 'The 
faculty desires it because these 
are the people who are going 10 
be taking the classes. But the 
faculty and administration can't 
get a really responsible 
commitment on the part of the 
students to pallicipate because 
they can't give them responsible 
authority, a vote. 

"A lot of times the faculty finds 
it useful if they could have 
students as voting members on 
these committees," he continued, 
"but they can't because of the 
Regents ' Standing Order (on the 
Academic Senate). I'd like 10 
work on removing that 
impediment to student 
participation." 

Another goal of Hoffman's is 
to push for excellence in 
undergraduate education during 
his one year term on the Board . 
Referring to the recently 
completed lower DiVISion Ta sh 
Force Report , Hoffman said he 
wants to see better trai ning 
programs for Teaching Assistants. 
seminars fo r freshmen, and more 
undergraduate exposure to the 
leadmg research scientists who 
house their wares in our halls of 
leaming. 

Issues aside, Hoffman's 

really a Regent of the UniverSity.", 
Hoffman is close to 

completing half of his one year 
term , which began in July of this 
year. And while he admits that 
school often "falls by the 
wayside," he feels that being on 
the board is an educational 
experience in itself. "This is kind 
of a learning lab for me: he said. 
"It's as valuable to spend a 
couple of hours in a Regents 
meeting or studying some of the 
Important issues as it is to sit in 
a political science lecture." 

But what does the rest of the 
University of California student 
body gain from having a Regent 
on the Board? Says Woodard , 
"(The position) is a start. Some 
people say it's a token 
participation in governance, but 1 
really believe that student regents 
can have a real impact if they 
really look at their constituency 
and take their constituency's 
needs (10 heall). You cellainly 
have afl equal voice on the 
Regents. It doesn't ask that you 
just sit there twiddling your 
thumbs, never getting a chance 
to speak" ~

A day in the life of a UCSD bike cop-
'Chuckling' with Mr. Hyde 
By IAN NEMEROV 

BIKE cop. Image of a hard-no ed guy wearing thick leather gloves, dark sun-
glasses and heavy boots - even 
in the hottesl of wcather. A guy 
who unflinchmgly snuffs ou[ 
bad-guys, then goes and throws 
around a few hundred pounds of 
weights before meeting hi friend 
at the nearest bar to drain a 
brew or twelve . 

Check our w.e. (Chuck) 
Milligan : 38 years old, balloon

music fiddling contests. Goes 
home to take care of his kids 
each day after work. Owner of 
thick leather gloves, dark 
sunglasses and heavy boots . He's 
a UC D Police Department bike 
cop 

Most of UCSD's students have 
seen him, he's usually outside 
Peterson Hall, at the curve in the 
parking lot, facing toward the 
stop ign. "Most people think I'm 
watching the StOp sign (for 
people who don't stOp), but I 
can't even see the sign from 
where I Sit," Milligan said. 
Instead , "I sit there because a lot 
of people go by. I can take off 
my dark glasses, my gloves and 
my helmet and let people see 
Ihat there's a real person sitting 
on the bike."

Pnor to JOining the UCSD Police, 

"This IS the best law

comletely backs the office and 
our equi pment IS tOp-notch . I 
also get to spend all day in the

His job also proVides the

"There 's nothing nicer than a 
friendly face . My job gives me a 
whole crop of outstanding 
people to work with . The caliber 
of students at UCSD are a cut 
above most," Milligan stated. 

Besides socializing, Milligan 
has several ofT the job interests 
to fill his spare time. He put his 
wife through nursing school by 
running a balloon company, 
where he mastered the classical 
art of making balloon animals. At 
the Third College Unolympics 
this quarter, he led a section of 
the parade featuring some of his 
balloon pets. 

Another pastime of Milligan's 

is playing the bluegrass guitar. 
He often acts as a back-up 
guitanst in contests sponsored 
by the California Fiddling 
Association. "I'm just an average 
guitarist, but I enjoy being on 
stage ," Milligan said, alTering 
more examples of his extrovened 
personality. 

Milligan is also a hypnotist, 
and he takes if quite seriously. 
He estimates that he perfonns 
about 75 dates a year, for clients 
as diverse as Carlos Murphy's 
and various sororities. However, 
despIte his success and the 
immense enjoyment he receives 
from performing, Milligan is clear 
that all of his hobbies are jusl 
that - hobbies. "Police work is 
and probably always will be my 
career," he said. 

Milligan stressed that his 

"Whatl really love is helping people out, making them think things aren 't as bad 
as they think." 

involvement in police work is 
more gratifying than his stage 
appearances. "What I really love 
is helping people out, making 
them think things aren't as bad 
as they think. I get a special 
feeling when 1 can do that." 

Milligan told of an incident 
earlier this fall where a student 
had crashed into three parked 
cars on North Torrey Pines Road 
and was quite upset, even more 
so when Milligan arrived. 
Milligan asked him if it was his 
ftrst accident and whether his 
Dad would be upset. Of course, 
the answers were both "yes." 
When Milligan realized how 
upset the student was, he tried 
to console him "r made him 
realize it was only metal and that 
it could be replaced . Then he 
didn't feel so bad ." 

Incidences such as th is 
maintain Milligan's love for his 
job; however, being a cop does 
have its drawbacks. "I have about 
10 to 15 negative contacts every 
day. I know I'm going to ruin 
someone's day when r give him a 
ticket. Further, there 's no joy in 
putUng someone in Jail. It's those 
few positive contacts which 
make this job so nice," he said. 

He expressed good feelings 
about his feUow officers. This 
emotion seems to be 
reciprocated by the rest of the 
[crce. Detective Zimmer of the 
police depanment said that he 
"and 'Chuckles' get along weU. 
We've worked close together for 
years. The only thing is he won't 
give me a ride on his bike." 
Milligan responded that it's 
because Zimmer won't wear a 
skin! ~

Oaks turned the tables. The fans 
quietly watched as Menlo proved 
why they were here, winning the 
game IS-S. 

Without question , the second 
game was the mOSt exciting of 
the four. Really, it was the only 
exciting game. The lead

From then on, it was all

Johnnies flushed in final 
Tritons advance after edging 5t.Johns 1-0 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO. Sports Editor 

T HE Saints from Minnesota don 't like marching into Warren Field. Last week 
the UCSD women's soccer team 
defeated St. Mary's and yesterday 
afternoon it was the Johnnies' 
tum as the TritOn men beat St. 
johns 1-0 and advanced to the 
Final Four of the NCAA Division 
III championship. 

For UCSD head coach Derek 8. Armstrong there was very little 
c!:! doubt on who would win the 
"f3 game as the Tritons dominated

" "Today, the better team deserved ;; ~ to win," said Armstrong. ' We

settled down . we played better." 
With the abse nce of Bubba 

Wingate, who was injured in a 
motor-scooter aCcident, UCSD 
resorted to a very agressive 
attacking game, led by senior 
forward Greg Schwarz . who 
made some Maradona-Iike moves 
allover the field . 

The Tritons missed several 
opportunities to score . and in 
one sequence of plays in the 
second half. eve n an open net 
couldn't tempt the hall in the 
goal. With 37:26 left in the game. 
Schwarz hit a perfect cross 
which lured johnnies' goalie Tim 
Gallaghar out of position . But 

UCSD's Joe Giacalone's header 
sailed over the crossbar. 

Yet UCSD kept a knockm' and 
finally came in when Craig Gross 
blasted a shot at Gallaghar. 
which car::ened off his hands 
and TritOn forward Robert 
Paterson blasted the rebound for 
the game's only score. 

"We made a few silly 
mistakes." said UCSD aSSistant 
coach Brian McManus." but 
overa ll we were in comrol of the 
game." 

UCSD's next opponent will be 
chosen today. but, according to 
Annstrong. "we're 99 percent 
sure it's Greensboro College from 
North Carolina." (i;i)

NA VY OFFICER * LEADS THE ADVENTURE 

V-ball 
Continued from page 12 
shutOut. Menlo made a valiant 
comeback attempt . eventually 
scoring seven points. but the 
outcome was never in doubt. 

Finally. on their third serve at 
game f Oint. UCSD made it 
officia . and the massive crowd 
errupted. The match was not as 
close as expected , but the home 
town fans were not 
disappointed, with the outcome 
ending in their favor. 

To reach the Regional Finals. 
Satun:lay. the Tritons first had to 
beat laVerne in a matchup that 
outlived all expectations. The 

first two games easily went to the 
Tritons, but when laVerne came 
back to win the third and fourth 
it was down to one deciding 
confrontatlon . Once again . it 
looked as though UCSD had 
control, taking a commanding 
11-2 lead . But the pesty 
Leopards from laVerne came 
back to tie it at eleven . 
Exhausted from their two 
comebacks. however. LaVerne 
couldn 't keep up with the well-
conditioned TritOns. UCSD won 
the match 15-3. 15-1 1. 11-15. S-
15.15-11. 

W hile many of the spectators 
were nervously watching both 
Triton playoff matches. UCSD 
coach Dannevik claims to have 

never been con erned. 
All season long the Tritons' 

strategy has been to "wear 
opponents down ." according to 
Dannevik. "I think our 
philosophy has been , 'It was 
going to take the best play for 
over an hour to beat us . the very 
best.' If we could keep attacking. 
we'd win ." 

As evidence of the strategy's 
effectivness, Dannevik points to 
the weekend playoff games. "The 
second and third games laVerne 
played great ." he said . But that 
was only an hour of good 
volleyball. and it's going to take 
more than that to beat UCSD. 
"We'll keep the pressure on and 
they'll crack." says the Triton 

coach of his Di vision III foes. 
Then , against archnval Menlo . 

the pattern continued . "They 
played great from S to 9 pm. The 
first game. they pla}'ed almost 
Oawless. The second game was 
close, we won 15-13; that lasted 
until 9 pm." Then UCSD pulled 
away. 

But the three previous 
confrontations with Menlo were 
all extremely close. Why was 
Saturdays game any different? 
"The crowd, and also we. were 
better prepared . We'd seen them 
before and knew what to 
expect." Yes, the crowd was 
definitely a factOr. Instead of a 
few people that might have 
accidentally stumbled into a

SPORTS 

Triton home game. the gym was 
filled with parti san fans. "The 
most we'd ever had was 350 to 
400 people." Dannevik said . 
"Friday there were 700 and last 
night (Satun:lay). there had to be 
over 1,000 ... with the crowd in 
the match Menlo couldn't keep 
up." 

Next up for UCSD is junieta. a 
Pennsylvania school. The match 
will be on Friday in Grand 
Rapids, Michigan, and if they 
win they'll play the 
championship game on Satun:lay. 
Dannevik is confident. "This is 
the toughest team we've ever had 
at UCSD. We're mentally very 
tough." he said .

Crew wanllS up 
By KAREN KUMM , 

T HE 15th annual Head of the Harbor$.egana was held Sunday, November 9, 
at San Pedro , the Los Angeles 
Harbor. It was an all-day event, 
the sun was shining, the weather 
was warm - perfect for some 
good roWIng - and there was a 
healthy crowd of supporters. 
UCSD crews participated with 
approximately eight Othcr clubs 
and college teams , primarily from 
Southern California. 

The Head of the Harbor is 
called a "head race" after the 

back east tradition of long ra es 
beginning at the head of a river. 
Head races are three miles long, 
whereas races in the spri ng 
season are 1.25 miles in length 
(2,000 meters). The official 
collegiate rowing season begins 
the first weekend of March. 
Races in the fall mix lub and 
college teams and are more for 
fun than for serious competition. 

Head races use a staggered 
start, the crews race against the 
clock rather than agaInst each 
other. Men's cights take 

approximately 18 minutes to 
comple te the J-mile course, it 
takes women about 22 minutes . 

How doc UCSD expect to do 
this year? "It's too early in the 
season to predict," said Peter 
Morris, lightweight, 'There will 
be so many changes in the boats 
between n o w and March ." The 
men entered eight crews and 
one single, one of them a mixed 
eight with the San Diego Police 
Department. One of the 
lightweight fours did 
exceptionally well , stroked by 
TIm Perfect, placing third behind 
USC and UC Santa Barbara. 
"This year's boat feels strong." 
said Chnsty Driehaus, Jrd year 
rower at UCSD , "We haw a 

Ule greal hee~ of the v.mld go by olle name: Wwcnhrdu. Brev.{.'(\ in Munidl. 

couple of returning varsity, the 
rest of the gi r1s are from last 
year's novice boat that went to 
Nationals. Once we get used to 
rowing together, wc should do 
even better." USC's win was a 
surprise to all, in the past the 
Trojans have never been 
considered as a serious 
contender. UCSD, the 
heavyweights' chief rival from 
last year, proved to be equally as 
competitive. 

With the major race of the faU 
season behind them, UCSD 
crews will be rowing less in the 
last few weeks of the quarter, 
and will concentrate on 
landtraining. Come Janua ry, the 
intense training will resume. ~
