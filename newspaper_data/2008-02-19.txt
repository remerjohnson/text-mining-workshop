A report recently authored by the 
main association for California college 
accreditation criticized the University 
of California for having “significant 
governance issues” that are still inad-
equately addressed by administrators 
from the 10-campus system.

The report from the Western 
Association of Schools and Colleges 
centers on general ambiguities regard-
ing the roles of the UC Board of 
Regents, the UC president and his staff, 
as well as ongoing issues regarding 
executive paychecks and compensa-
tion. Specifically, the WASC report 
argues that the system lacks a consis-
tent, annual evaluation of the president 
or regents, or any consistent procedures 
for how the regents come to decisions.

WASC found that the UC Office of 
the President decides which elements of 
compensation to report “on a case-by-
case basis” due to a lack of compliance 
with WASC standards, including the 
absence of an internal audit system and 
central system of personnel records.

Though the report does not jeop-
ardize the current accreditation of UC 
schools, its authors warned officials 
that failure to address these issues could 
threaten the UC system’s reputation.

A university-released response 
countered that the WASC report did not 
detail past and ongoing efforts made to 
fix the cited problems.

For example, the rebuttal said, an 
annual evaluation of the president was 
already adopted in 2006, and put into 
practice thereafter. In 2007, the evalu-
ation was renewed, but UC President 
Robert C. Dynes announced his res-
ignation in August. Since that time, 
university officials said they have relied 
on committee meetings to foster “an 
excellent understanding of duties.”

UCOP officials also defended their 
recent push for compensation reform.

“The reforms we have imple-
mented over the last two years ensure 
that compensation is not withheld,” 
UCOP Communications Director 
Brad Hayward said. “We have gone 
to extraordinary lengths to provide 
each and every detail of compensation 
publicly for those employees whose 
compensation must be approved by the 
Board of Regents.”

Though Hayward said the report 
does not focus on individual com-
pensation, media scrunity has been 
strong regarding UCSD Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox’s paycheck, the high-
est among all UC chancellors.

UCSD spokeswoman Dolores Davies 
declined to comment on the report.

In addition, efforts are already 
underway to restructure the office 
of the president, with the Regents’ 
Committee on Governance discussing 
the roles and responsibilities of the 
governing board, Hayward said.

Grove’s Debt Continues to Grow STUDENTS 
LEAD CHARGE 
FOR TUITION 

RELIEF
Interest group pushes 
for ballot initiative that 
would stop UC tuition 
from surpassing 
consumer price index.

By Hadley Mendoza
Senior Staff Writer

The Grove Caffe’s debt has nearly 
tripled just one quarter after reopening 
with an updated product selection and 
new external manager.

The cafe, an A.S. Council enter-
prise, seemed to have hit rock bottom 
last year when the council considered 
shutting it down. However, after exten-
sive talks with Grove employees and 
supporters, the council decided to hire 
external manager Cleveland Thomas to 
help with the cafe’s then-about-$24,000 
financial woes. 

But as of January, the debt had 
ballooned to more than $66,000, with 
much of the loss incurred between 
September and November 2007. The 
Grove, which was steadily losing 

money for more than five years, was 
closed at the start of the school year 
and reopened in the middle of Fall 
Quarter. 

“In order for the Grove to be 
reopened, [Thomas] needed to change 
many necessary things, including 
bringing many aspects of the Grove 
up to code,” said Chelsea Maxwell, A.S. 
vice president of enterprise operations. 
“A large majority of the increased debt 
has been a result of this work.”

Maxwell said Student Center con-
struction has been an added strain on 
the Grove, but that her office plans to 
overcome the hurdle with increased 
publicity. While Thomas agreed that 
construction has presented a sizable 
problem for the cafe, he said he believes 
publicity won’t solve the problem.

“Expanded publicity won’t have a 
positive affect on the Grove until the 
Student Center remodel is completed 
and students return on a regular basis,” 
Thomas said.

Because of such construction com-
plications, increased patronage to the  
Grove will likely be delayed, though the 
cafe was originally expected to be out of 

debt by June 2009, Thomas said. 
He added, however, that he expects 

the cafe to begin turning a monthly 
profit by June 2008.

“I think that due to the construc-
tion and accessibility of the old Student 
Center as a whole it’s going to take all 
of those businesses more time to regain 
financial stability,” Thomas said. “I will 
say that the Grove is very close to doing 
so in just a few months. So, there are no 
ongoing financial struggles.”

The A.S. Council, which now car-
ries sole financial responsibility for 
the Grove after prior co-owner Ron 
Carlson liquidated his ownership last 
year, has decided to wait until construc-
tion finishes to make any major deci-
sions for the cafe’s future. 

“The numbers aren’t looking very 
good right now,” A.S. President Marco 
Murillo said, indicating he would like 
to be able to assess the situation before 
the end of the year to give the incoming 
council a recommendation. Thomas’ 
contract is for only one year, he added.

With undergraduate fees increasing 
by 94 percent over the past six years, the 
first student-led ballot initiative propos-
es a five-year freeze on hiking tuition 
costs at the University of California and 
California State University institutions 
for resident undergraduate students. 

Supported by the nongovernment 
organization Greenlining Action, a 
group calling itself Tuition Relief Now 
has proposed the College Affordability 
Act of 2008, which would block future 
education fees from surpassing the 
inflation rate. The Student Affirmative 
Action Committee oversees the cam-
paign at UCSD, which has until mid-
April to collect the 434,000 valid signa-
tures required to qualify the act for the 
November 2008 election ballot. 

“Imagine how it’ll feel for a stu-
dent to walk in the governor’s build-
ing and present half a million petition 
signatures,” Campaign Director and 
UC Berkeley student Chris Vaeth said. 
“That puts a lot of power into the hands 
of students — something we’ve never 
had before.” 

Last month, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger proposed a $332-
million reduction in state funding 
to the UC system. The state’s $14.5-
billion budget deficit will potentially 
provide the UC system with hundreds 
of millions less than the UC Board of 
Regents’ request for next academic year, 
and the cuts are projected to impact 
enrollment growth, tuition costs and 
individual university programs. 

“This budget proposal will have 
serious impacts on our ability to deliver 
on our mission for our students and for 
the people of California,” UC President 
Robert C. Dynes said in a press release. 
“State funding for the university is not 
an expenditure but an investment — an 
investment that produces real returns 
through an educated workforce, a 
dynamic economy, job creation and 
new tax revenue.”

The budget reduction would 
increase undergraduate tuition fees by at 
least 7 percent for 2008-09, depending 
on the regents’ final decision regarding 
financial aid allocations. 

In 1960, the California Master 
Plan for Higher Education was 
developed to act as guidance for the 
UC system’s goals. The document 
proposed tuition-free education for 
resident undergraduates, allowing only

Outreach Cuts Follow Gov.’s Budget Proposal
By Kimberly Cheng
Associate News Editor

State lawmakers approved a series of 
midyear budget cuts proposed by Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger last week that 
jeopardizes funding for the California 
Student Opportunity and Access 
Program, which has led the program’s 
local chapter to eliminate several out-
reach services and lay off almost half of 
its student staff. 

During the 2008-09 school year, Cal-
SOAP programs will see a 10-percent 
funding reduction statewide. The local 
branch of Cal-SOAP, which is admin-
istered through UCSD and serves all 
schools within the San Diego Unified 
School District and a few schools from 
Imperial County, lost 25.7 percent of 
its annual budget this year, cutting 

$325,000 from its funding. Its current 
budget sits at $938,000, which may 
decrease by another $94,000 next year. 

Cal-SOAP serves students from low-
income families, first-generation college 
students and students from schools or 
geographic areas with documented low 
college eligibility or participation rates. 
The programs inform applicants about 
college education and financial aid to 
elementary, middle and high school 
students while raising their academic 
achievement levels.

The student staff consists of about 
75 college peer advisers and 75 tutors. 

Schwarzenegger’s budget cuts have 
forced Cal-SOAP to turn its focus to 
high school students while slashing or 
limiting several early college awareness 
and academic enrichment programs. 

“It’s not necessarily a retreat, but 

it is who we provide direct services to 
that’s going to shift,” Cal-SOAP Director 
Linda Doughty said. “Further cuts are 
still undecided because of the reduction 
in the amount of students we can hire 
to do the job. We’re probably going to 
start by pulling tutors out of the middle 
schools. We’re trying to start at ninth 
grade and follow them through high 
school.”

Outreach programs that were 
cut include “Students with Advance 
Advisement Training,” which pro-
vides two presentations at high schools 
regarding admissions and financial aid, 
“Cash In On Community College,” 
which assists students who miss the 
March 2 financial aid deadline, and 
elementary school tutoring programs

UCSD Goes Nautical for 
New Cancer-Fighting Drug

A team of UCSD researchers has 
discovered a new, highly potent can-
cer-fighting drug isolated from a toxic 
algae found in the South Pacific 
Ocean. Researchers found that the 
drug, called somocystinamide A, 
inhibits the formation of blood ves-
sels that feed tumors and directly 
impacts the process of tumor cell 
proliferation. 

Headed by Dennis Carson, a pro-
fessor of medicine and director of the 
Rebecca and John Moores Cancer 
Center, the research team discov-
ered the ScA compound in the cya-
nobacteria L. Majuscula, gathered off 
the coast of Fiji by the laboratory of 
William Gerwick at Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography.

“We are excited because we have 
discovered a structurally unique and 
highly potent cancer-fighting com-
pound,” associate professor of 
pathology at the Moores Cancer 
Center Dwayne G. Stupack said in 
a statement. “We envision it will be 
perfect for emerging technology, par-
ticularly nanotechnology, which is 
being developed to target cancerous 
tumors without toxic side effects.”

Senior project scientist at the 
Moores Cancer Center Wolf Wrasidlo 
said that the drug’s unique structure 
makes it well-suited to be used with 
nanotechnology due to its tendency 
to incorporate spontaneously into 
molecule-sized nanoparticles. This 
sort of behavior is important for the 
type of highly targeted combination 
therapy currently under development 
for cancer treatment. The drug’s 
structure is also simple enough that 
the research team is able to repro-

duce it.
“ScA is the first, and most potent 

compound we’ve identified so far,” 
Stupack said.

Lake Mead Could Run Dry 
by 2021, Scripps Says
Lake Mead, one of the main 

water sources for residents of the 
Southwestern United States, could 
run dry by 2021 if current trends in 
water usage and climate change 
continue, two researchers at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography said. 

Marine physicist Tim Barnett 
and climate scientist David Pierce 
concluded in a study that human 
factors, including demand for water 
and human-caused climate change, 
combined with natural forces, are 
contributing to a loss of nearly one 
million acre-feet of water every year 
from the Colorado River system. 
This amount, according to the study, 
could supply about eight million peo-
ple if preserved. 

The loss of Lake Mead as a 
source of water could jeopardize 
the ability of the Colorado River sys-
tem to sustain the population of the 
Southwest through an unusually dry 
year or in the event of a prolonged 
drought. This would create a highly 
unpredictable state of water delivery 
for the region, Barnett and Pierce 
said. 

Barnett and Pierce expressed 
deep concern for their findings, 
stressing that the reported trends 
could have severe consequences for 
the region.

“We were stunned at the magni-
tude of the problem and how fast it 
was coming at us,” Barnett said in a 
statement.

McElroy, also the SAAC chair, said 
she became involved because of her 
$14,000 debt from student loans. 

“Our tuition has doubled in the 
past six years, but not necessarily the 
quality of our education,” McElroy 
said. “There’s less one-on-one 
between faculty and students, and 
new buildings are constantly made — 
but it doesn’t seem like our increased 
tuition is being directly targeted to 
benefit students.” 

The act would impose a 1-
percent tax on California residents 
with annual incomes exceeding $1 
million, requiring that 60 percent 
of the estimated $2-billion revenue 
to go to UC and CSU institutions. 
The remaining educational funds 
would be distributed toward K-14 
education. 

The initiative has gained support 
from students and parents who are tired 
of inflating tuition fees, Vaeth said. 

housing and supplementary fees. But 
in the past four decades, fees have 
grown exponentially, contradicting the 
statements held within the Master Plan, 
according to Vaeth.

UC undergraduates’ tuition in 
1979-80 was $736 in comparison to 
this academic year’s $7,511 fee. 

TRN was developed with the 
objective of redirecting the UC sys-
tem back toward its original mani-
festo of a more affordable college 
education, though the effort’s limited 
finances have necessitated heavy stu-
dent participation.

Despite its small funding base, the 
campaign has seen success in growth 
due to a large volunteer base and an 
organized, credible nonprofit institution 
— key strengths that separate the ini-
tiative from past student-led organiza-
tions, according to Thurgood Marshall 
College senior Nicole McElroy. 

“Students realized something cohe-
sive had to be done to stop the fees 
from hiking up again,” he said.

Additionally, the legislation would 
create an accountability board consist-
ing of students, administrators and fac-
ulty members to monitor the allocation 
of the new tax’s funds. 

The accountability panel would help 
make budget distributions more trans-
parent, according to A.S. All-Campus 
Senator Utsav Gupta. 

“This campaign is an effective way 
to bring light to an issue that’s affect-
ing a lot of students in California and 
hopefully we’ll be able to see some 
reform,” Gupta said. “The legislation 
will affect two million resident UC and 
CSU undergraduates — I think we can 
definitely get some good change out 
there for students.”

such as “America Reads” and “Math

“I think who is going to get hurt 
the most is students in low-income 
families,” Doughty said. “They’re really 
going to get slammed.”

Remaining outreach programs such 
as “I’m Going to College” have been 
modified or limited to selective schools. 
The “College: Making It Happen” pro-
gram now only serves 21 of its previous 
41 schools, and because advisement 
is limited to a skeleton crew of CPAs, 
peer-to-peer advising has shifted to 
large-scale presentations.

“I don’t really know if there will be a 
Cal-SOAP future,” said Vanessa Nuñez, 
Cal-SOAP’s student assistant to the 
director and scholarship coordinator.

Nuñez emphasized the importance 
of preserving peer-to-peer relationships. 

Impact of State Budget Cuts Still Unclear
▶ OUTREACH, from page 1 “You build up the student’s confi-

dence and empower them,” Nuñez said. 
“You get them to open up to you. These 
kids need the hand-holding. Now, it’s 
not going to be as personal.”

Cal-SOAP also lost five members 
of its full-time staff last year, including 
those who worked with middle schools 
and the “College: Making It Happen” 
program and one staff member who 
was responsible for student data.

“We might as well not have the 
program as a whole because cutting sev-
eral components of outreach means that 
student staff can’t be out there doing 
their job,” Lead College Peer Adviser 
Tou Fang said. 

CPAs compose the program’s pri-
mary training resource. They are taught 
to provide support for high school coun-
seling personnel, working 10 to 12 hours 
a week to address the needs of over 4,000 

seniors.
“I don’t see that there’s anyone who 

does what I do,” said Sixth College 
senior Porsia Thomas, a CPA at Helix 
High School in La Mesa. “I help any-
where up to 50 students a day. I teach 
them how to fill out FAFSA. They don’t 
know who else to go to.”

As a legislative program, Cal-
SOAP works under the direction of the 
California Student Aid Commission. 
Student data is sent to the commission, 
and CSAC reports the information to 
the Legislature. 

“We can’t anticipate how the indi-
vidual programs will be affected,” CSAC 
spokeswoman Yvonne Stewart-Buchen 
said. “But we’re doing everything we can 
to minimize the effect on students.”

I fucking love Las Vegas. Even after enduring that long-as-hell cramped car ride on Friday 
through the desolate stretches of 
brown scrubland that we all forget 
is actually still part of California, 
the mere sight of the city’s distant 
twinkling lights grazing the night 
horizon was all it took for me to 
muster some unknown energy deep 
from within my inner self, and pre-
pare for the festivities that I knew 
were about to take place.

But before I discuss the city’s 
slimy yet oh-so-satisfying charac-
ter, let’s rewind. This President’s 
Day weekend excursion to Vegas is 
Guardian tradition, so, to say the 
least, my co-workers and I were 
quite excited to get the hell out of 
our messy, cramped (yet totally awe-
some) Student Center offices and 
get our collective party on.

I’ve made the trek with fellow 
staffers to Nevada’s oasis of sin on 
multiple occasions now, and each 
time have been pleasantly surprised 
by the unique experiences thrown at 
me from the Strip’s every nook and 
cranny. In short, Vegas is nonstop 
hilarity and constant insanity, and 
I’m going to tell you why.

First of all, people watching in 
Sin City seriously never gets old. I’m 
not even joking; there’s no where 
else on the planet where you can 
find so many interesting-looking 
people of all shapes, sizes, races, 
ages and intelligence levels sitting 
side by side in entranced harmony, 
hoping to win that coveted million-
dollar jackpot.

I’ve found that merely sitting 
on the casino sidelines and hear-
ing those distinct jangles and beeps 
emanating from the slot machines is 
a great way to start off the evening 
— if nothing else, you will at least be 
able to laugh at the sea of gamblers 
and the intense looks they have 
on their faces as they pull the slot-
machine lever. 

If you decide to observe the bet-
ting strangers for a bit longer, their 
robotic looks occasionally evolve 
into surprise, disgust, anger  (I saw 
one woman scream “No” and slap 
the side of her machine) and even-
tually momentary defeat. 

And I say momentary because 
after they lose on one machine they 
get up and sit at one a few feet down 
before the process begins again.

In fact, the whole city and every-
thing that happens there is a cycle 
— a cycle of pure, unadulterated 
debauchery. 

But that’s precisely why we went, 
because the events that accompany 
such a cycle are unpredictably enter-
taining.

Every day and every night are 
essentially the same: drunken Strip-
wanderers, shady guys yelling that 
they can get you into x-club(s), 
people screaming, sirens roaring 
down Las Vegas Boulevard, mul-

LOCAL NEWS — Let’s face it, when 
it comes to internationally renowned 
cities, San Diego is but a dot on a map. 
Other than its sunshine and livability, 
the recognition and mystique reserved 
for cities like Paris or New York simply 
do not have a place here in this city by 
the sea. That said, when a large, media-
frenzied golf tournament is looking for 
a place to roost, the San Diego com-
munity is understandably quick to roll 
out the red carpet. 

But the burden that comes with 
such a colossal event almost exclusively 
rests on the shoulders of students and 
faculty with no tenable benefits for 
those inconvenienced by it. 

After an e-mail half-heartedly 
apologizing for inconveniences the 
event may cause from Vice Chancellor 
of Business Affairs Steven W. Relyea, 
UCSD students, staff and faculty have 
been bracing for the last week of Spring 

Quarter — finals week, that is — when 
the U.S. Open golf tournament rolls 
into town. Hosted only a stone’s throw 
away from campus at the Torrey Pines 
Golf Course, the highly anticipated 
event is expected to bring close to 
50,000 visitors daily to the San Diego 
and La Jolla communities. 

There’s no doubt about it: A golf 
tournament of 
this scale brings 
unprecedented 
publicity and atten-
tion to a region, 
not to mention the 
obvious economic 
benefits to be had 
in hosting such a 
venerable affair — 
but is it worth it? 

The U.S. Open, 
is, excuse the pun, 
an entirely differ-
ent ballgame. As 
one of golf ’s four flagship champion-
ships, UCSD will bear the onus of 
accommodating thousands of people, 
renting out its parking, security and 
shuttle services to both casual and ded-
icated golf fans. Additionally, UCSD 
commencement ceremonies will be 
postponed in light of the $7 million 
championship. 

The fact that UCSD agreed to it 

is no shocker — our school has been 
doing it for ages. The university has 
been lavishing golf tournament orga-
nizers with parking, hospitality and 
other things for which students nor-
mally pay a fortune since 1968: essen-
tially, since the school was founded.

Relyea has offered several sugges-
tions to mitigate the obvious incon-

venience of accom-
modating an addi-
tional 50,000 people 
in the surround-
ing area. For one, 
whenever feasible 
academic depart-
ments should “con-
sider telecommut-
ing arrangements 
for the period of 
June 9-15.” 

Finals week is a 
time when students 
need professors the 

most, and the administration is shoo-
ing them away? Does UCSD want 
final exams to be administered via tele-
phone, too? It could be simple. After 
all, premed students could press one 
for deoxyribonucleic acids and poli-sci 
kids could expound on the virtues of 
a bicameral legislature using their cell 
phone, sounz good 2 me. 

Even more disconcertingly, Relyea 

hopes that staff will consider including 
this stressful week in their summer 
vacation plans. Of course, what UCSD 
student in his or her right mind, dur-
ing the most taxing week of the quar-
ter, would need to eat at a dining hall 
or use anything else the UCSD staff 
is charged with to maintain? By all 
means, enjoy Hawaii. 

When asked how the U.S. Open 
will personally impact the chancellor 
and her staff, lead university spokes-
woman Stacie A. Spector’s response 
was as evasive as it was vague. 

“We are trying to manage several 
aspects for students, faculty and staff 
to minimize disruption and inconve-
nience,” she said. Come again?  

Thankfully, the administration 
asserted, UCSD will be handsomely 
rewarded for its sacrifices. The USGA 
will so graciously provide a hospitality 
tent, and UCSD may have the honor 
of being mentioned in the tourna-
ment program as an effort to advertise 
UCSD. Excellent plan, but how would 
a university benefit from advertising to 
thousands of octogenarians who have 
no intention of going back to school? 

In any case, to the organization’s 
credit, the USGA has pledged to com-
pensate the school for all expenses, 

Student Interests Abandoned as Golf  Tourney Tees Off  
June’s U.S. Open brings 
undue burden to the

reaps all the benefits.

A.S. COUNCIL — Cleveland Thomas, 
the Grove Caffe’s new external man-
ager, has the following timeline: If he 
cannot show financial progress to the 
A.S. Council by the end of this year, 
then his job — and the Grove itself — 
are likely to be terminated. With that 
kind of motivation and the year half-
way over, the cafe should be making 

significant strides toward becoming 
self-supporting, or at least working out 
of its five-figure deficit. But the truth is 
in the numbers, and the Grove’s defi-
cit has nearly tripled — from about 
$24,000 to about $67,000 — under 
Thomas’ watch.

According to A.S. Associate Vice 
President of Enterprise Operations 
Chelsea Maxwell, much of the 
increase comes from anticipated start-
up expenses, and was spent during 
October and November. Costs includ-
ed making sure that nothing in or 
around the cafe violated code and 
schoolwide marketing expenses. But 
the Grove continued to struggle even 
after a $34,000 start-up push. The 
deficit increased by roughly $6,000 

between December and January with 
an insignificant — literally, about $12 
— income increase between the two 
months. 

“Beginning in December and con-
tinuing through January,” Maxwell 
said, “the Grove did well given that 
it has extremely limited access and 
the campus was closed for a couple 
of weeks.”

What? If an additional six grand 
of student-fee support per month is 
considered a success, clearly Maxwell, 
and Grove workers, needs a swift real-
ity check. Rather than bring the cafe 
any hope of financial stability, Thomas 
has pushed it farther into the hole — if 
the Grove continues losing money at 
the rate of $6,000 a month for the rest 
of the year, it will amass more debt in 
five months than it had in the past five 
years without any consistent manage-
ment.

Thomas and Maxwell have expect-
edly spit out weak excuses: There are 
a lot of start-up costs. The Student 
Center construction has hurt business. 

Forget for a moment that the Grove 
isn’t new — so no actual “start-up” took 
place — and that Thomas knew about 
the construction when he was hired 
and should have planned accordingly. 
The fact of the matter remains: Neither 
Thomas nor Maxwell has any plan 
of how to improve sales — their very 
responses to the question reveal how 
gloomy the Grove’s future really is.

“My plans for pulling the Grove out 
of debt is to continue making a reason-
able profit over time to pay down a 
debt that I inherited,” Thomas said.

Brilliant plan — if it reconciled with 
reality. The Grove has no base from 
which to build even with Thomas’ 
supervision, and has instead fallen 
deeper than ever into debt. And where 
is that money coming from? Students’ 
pockets. 

Last year, when the Grove’s debt 
first made headlines, then co-owner 
Ron Carlson decided wisely to cut his 
losses, making the A.S. Council fully 
responsible for the cafe’s fate. And 
while Thomas claims he will bring 
the cafe out of debt without dipping 
into student fees, this looks to be just 
another example of how out of touch 
he is. 

“No activity fee funds are being 

used to offset the Grove’s debt or oper-
ational cost,” he said. “The debt will be 
retired through solid management of 
the Grove’s operations and finances, 
both of which I was hired to do.”  

So it looks like solid manage-
ment means running the cafe into 
the ground. To bring the Grove out of 
debt, Thomas began offering products 
that the cafe’s Student Center neigh-
bors already provide. This doesn’t 
make sense at all — why would an 
A.S. enterprise want to duplicate the 
products of nearby student-run shops? 
But perhaps the most outrageous of 
Thomas’ new flubs is buying tons of 
salads, which don’t sell and end up 
being given away. Thomas should 
have been brought in as an efficiency 
manager, to streamline the cafe’s costs 
and expenses. The last thing the Grove 
needs is to waste more money.

“I think that the marginal cost of 
rotating out stale food for fresh food 
and providing enough food options for 
our consumers is better than running 
out of food,” the coffee-shop manager 
said. “The average small business allo-
cates 1 to 3 percent of its revenue to 
waste.”

But what Thomas forgets is that 
the average small business isn’t given 
a blank check from the Bank of UCSD 
Undergraduates to do with what it 
will.

Maxwell anticipates that “as the old 
Student Center reopens and the Grove 
continues to expand its menu and 
catering, it will soon begin to work 
its way out of debt.” But as long as the 
Grove remains in an ever-increasing 
deficit, it will continue to be a drain 
on student fees — money that could 
be put to better use elsewhere. 

The A.S. Council needs to get its 
act together and think very seriously 
about how much patience the Grove 
deserves. For no matter how loud 
and passionate its supporters, they are 
blatantly few. 

It’s not the function of A.S. 
Enterprises to waste student funds 
on resources people clearly don’t use 
and it’s not the responsibility of 22,000 
undergrads to finance an unpopular 
coffee shop.

In 

ticolored flashing lights, women 
wearing strange feather headdresses 
and sequins and more billboards for 
cheap all-you-can eat prime rib than 
I ever thought were possible. 

All the while, the huge — and 
admittedly beautiful — hotels and 
casinos tease passersby with adver-
tisements for shows and shops as 
strangers thrust naked-lady cards in 
your face every five seconds offer-
ing a phone number for a quick $39 
escort special. 

It’s easy to 
see how that 
kind of environ-
ment brings out 
everyone’s inner 
crazy.

And I defi-
nitely saw it 
come out among 
my co-workers 
this weekend. 
I’m not going 
to name names 
— you all know 
the Vegas motto 
— but let’s just 
say there were some interesting lines 
spoken this weekend, among them 
being:

“I can feel the gravity,” uttered 
by one particularly inebriated edi-
tor as she met the elevator floor 
for the first time; “My name starts 
with an ‘A,’ and your name has 
an ‘A’ in it,” spoken after I asked 
for justification following another 
staffer’s drunken assertion that we 
were twins; and “Shmanadipsy!,” a 
spur-of-the-moment term coined by 
another drunk editor who couldn’t 
think of the correct lyrics to a song 
we were all singing.

I think a weekend like that, 
where we could forget about school 
and work and San Diego in general, 

was long overdue for all of us. 
That’s why Vegas is the perfect 

destination for a trip; you can pre-
tend you’re a baller for a few days 
and actually spend a few dollars on 
things that you would never oth-
erwise buy, like $1 30-second lap 
dances or yard-long, watered-down 
daiquiris.

And you can do it all from the 
safe confines of anonymity. No one 
around you cares about your antics 
(even the police didn’t stop me when 
I walked past them carrying a drunk 

co-worker on my 
back) because 
everyone is there 
for the exact same 
reasons you are.

But the best 
thing about this 
weekend was 
that amid all of 
the chaotic bom-
bardment, I was 
reminded how 
lucky I am to be 
an American. 
As I drunkenly 
stumbled down 

the Strip toward god-knows-what, 
I decided to stop and watch the 
Bellagio’s famous water show. As 
I gazed up, I realized that “Proud 
to Be an American” was the theme 
song accompanying the towering 
columns of water.

Laughing at the ridiculousness of 
the situation, I turned around to see 
a “Hot Babes” truck barreling down 
the Strip and a group of drunk bros 
yelling catcalls at some girls that 
were way too hot for them. 

I think it was the overwhelming 
irony of the moment that finally 
made me realize just how much I 
love Las Vegas — either that, or the 
fact that I knew I had more party-
ing to do.

including repairs that may be neces-

UCSD land. 

So why does UCSD yield so will-
ingly to the whims of the USGA 
and the city of La Jolla? According 
to Spector, for no reason other than 
a compelling spirit of being good 
neighbors. Usually, the phrase “good 
neighbors” implies some semblance 
of reciprocity, and frankly La Jolla has 
yet to agree to something that would 
benefit the UCSD community. This is 
surprising because, as an entity, UCSD 
has brought more to La Jolla and San 
Diego than any second-rate city could

Until UCSD gets more out of it 
than a hospitality tent and a courtesy 
blurb on a piece of paper, there is abso-
lutely no justification for our school to 
bear such a heavy load at a time when 
students need absolutely everything 
the school can offer them the most. 
Where are our priorities? Is UCSD an 
institution of learning dedicated to its 
students and faculty, or is it a crony at

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

A t 12:54 a.m. on Feb. 15, John Muir College senior Lindsey Fogleman was tired. Up since the early morning, she had spent that day attending classes, planning events for the upcoming week, gathering 
residents in her house to play intramural dodgeball games against 
rival houses, running the long weekly house meetings with her 
advising partner and completing her homework assignments and 
projects, all while studying for midterms.

The clock made her anxious. Six more minutes and she would 
be done for the night, able to drift into sleep before repeating her 
daily routine all over again. But, unfortunately for Fogleman, the 
shrill ringing of her landline phone brought her back to reality. It 
was a freshman, locked out of her room. After taking down the 
resident’s information, Fogleman grabbed the master key ring and 
headed out the door into the chilly night. 

“Lock outs are my main responsibility when I’m on duty,” 
Fogleman said. “Residents never seem to remember their keys.”

As a Muir College house adviser, Fogleman joins approxi-
mately 138 undergraduate resident advisers who make up much 
of the residential life staff from each of UCSD’s six colleges. Each 
RA is responsible for anywhere from 40 to more than 90 first- and 
second-year student residents who live in on-campus apartment 
and residential buildings.

RAs provide students with a developed sense of community 
by organizing social, recreational and cultural activities through-
out the year. Their job is to work with their residents to facilitate 
open communication between roommates, suitemates or apart-
ment mates, and enforce residential life policies and regulations. 
They are required to work more than 12 active hours a week and 
plan more than a dozen events throughout the year in addition to 
participating in all collegewide events.

But there’s more to RAs than meets the eye, said Karlyn 
Nieland, a Thurgood Marshall College senior and second-year 
RA.

 “Each RA is very different, but we were residents at one time 
too, and we can relate to a lot of the problems that our first- and 
second-year students are facing now,” Nieland said.

Although RAs try to encourage a lively social atmosphere for 
their residents, according to Fogleman, fighting student apathy is 
one of the biggest problems they face daily. 

“It’s really frustrating when students tell you they are interested 
in attending an event you’ve spent some time planning, but when 
it comes down to it some students would rather be doing some-
thing else,” she said. “I feel bad though — we are spending their 
money on these events that most people don’t even go to.”

Nieland agrees, but said that experienced RAs know that the 
success of an event depends upon quality of the experience, not 
the quantity of students who attend. 

“Some of the newer RAs are sad if they only had 10 people 
show up to an event out of 80, but all the old RAs are like, ‘You 
had 10 people come? That’s awesome! And they stayed the whole 
time? That’s great,’” Nieland said. “It’s not possible for you to get 
everyone super excited about one event, with so many interests. 
But if only 10 people come and they enjoy it, then it’s worth it.”

Fogleman said a major challenge is keeping track of time, 
because although she might have every aspect of her day sched-

uled, there are always a few surprises that can upset her methodi-
cal system.

“At the beginning of this quarter, quite a few [of my] residents 
got sick. Even though I had a midterm the very next morning, 
I was responsible for their health and safety. I drove them to he 
hospital and stayed the entire time they needed me,” she said. 
“It’s tough to balance everything, especially  when this job really 
can be 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week because you’re always 
potentially on call.”

Fogleman considers her strong bond with her residents to be a 
perk, but admits that there are times when she is forced to drop 
her friendly demeanor when handling disciplinary issues, which 
can cause the biggest rift between RAs and their residents.

“Discipline is such a hard thing,” she said. “You want to 
be friends with everyone, but no one wants to be friends 
with the person who gets them in trouble. But that’s our 
job, that’s why we attend weekly three-hour long meetings, 
that’s why we know how to enforce these rules. It makes 
me cringe every time I have to do it, but I also think that 
students know when they are breaking the rules, and [in] 
doing so knowingly, they are disrespecting me.”

RAs face problems ranging from alcohol and drug pos-
session to noise complaints to student quarrels to even theft. 
Amanda Issa, Eleanor Roosevelt College senior and first-time 
RA, said that she and the rest of the ERC staff generally write 
students up twice or more per week. Issa added that running 
into residents off campus presents a tricky situation.

“Some RAs might want to go to a party but they have to 
be careful because they don’t know who they are going to run 
into,” she said. “What goes on off campus we have no jurisdic-
tion over. “But really, no one is going to respect you if they saw 
you dancing on a table drunk the night before.”

With such demanding responsibilities, RAs enjoy free hous-
ing, free meal points and an additional $1,200 stipend on their 
TritonPlus account for extra expenses both on and off campus. 
RAs in the apartment complexes may also choose to live with 
one friend from any college of any year who does not have 
guaranteed housing. 

Most RAs agree that their roles in residential life have  
enhanced their college experience, since that they did not miss 
out on anything. 

“I have my whole life to live in my own house,” Fogleman 
said. “But as a residential adviser I hold a special place at the 
university and I make connections with both residents and 
other advisers that I normally wouldn’t have made. It’s great 
knowing that I get to have at least 86 new friends each year on 
Facebook.”

On Saturday nights a river flows through Pacific Beach. Fluid spirits and charged emotions 
churn in the local nightlife businesses, 
gaining momentum in whirlpool fash-
ion before being released and stagnat-
ing on the sidewalks of Garnet Avenue. 
Like a basin, it collects people into 
a stretch of bars 
where, on a 
sunny day, they 
might otherwise 
flow directly to 
the beach and 
into the Pacific.

It’s fueled by 
the many tribu-
taries leading out into the neighbor-
hood and greater San Diego. Five min-
utes after parking on a side street sev-
eral blocks from Garnet Ave., I could 
already feel the current pulling me in. 
It was silent, but I soon heard someone 
yelling. I got my camera out, sensing 
that I would need it earlier than I had 
planned. It was 11 p.m., and a young 
man was shouting at another, named 
Jordan, trying to get him to throw a 
punch. It was obvious why; a girl stood 

to the side, pleading in vain for them 
to stop.

“You are the biggest fucking pussy 
that I’ve ever met!” said the first guy.

“You’re my best friend,” said the 
other in a low voice.

I had come upon them as they 
crashed out of an apartment. But they 

continued and 
matched my 
speed for two 
blocks, one man 
yelling, the other 
walking back-
ward. I had put 
some distance 
between us when 

I heard the dull thud of fist on flesh.
A block toward Garnet, I saw Jordan 

running toward me from a cross street. 
Winded from circling the block, he 
ran off just as his pursuer turned the 
corner, still yelling. I could hear him 
behind me, getting closer. When he 
told Jordan to stop walking away from 
him, I froze and turned around. We 
made eye contact and he realized he

A Diagnosis for Student Health
Providing discounted treatment on 
campus, Student Health Services 

strives to provide quality care, 
but undermanned staffing 

and clerical problems pose 
the biggest hurdles.

By Raven Bates
Staff Writer

The main entrance of the 
Student Health Services opens 
up to the lobby where, to the 
right, there is receptionist coun-
ter where students check in for 
urgent care and pre-scheduled 
appointments. To the left there is 
a cashier and pharmacy. Between 
them lies a maze of chairs, maga-
zines and something resembling 
a check-in line. There are signs 
that point to conference rooms, 
optometry services, insurance, 
first aid and an LED sign list-

ing off announcements and 
upcoming events for the Health 
Education Program. 

Although there are no publicly 
posted instructions on where to 
start, the first step after entering  
Student Health is to fill out a blue 
information sheet located next 
to the receptionist desk. After 
filling out the information, the 
forms are to be put in a box at the 
front of the desk so a reception-
ist can direct the patient to the 
right place.

“I don’t know how many times 
a day that front desk reception-
ist has to listen to some poor, 
sick student’s sob story, just to 
point him straight to the box of 
blue papers,” Thurgood Marshall 
College junior Harn Chiu said.

Created in 1965, the Student 
Health Center has provided 
health services, maintained low 
prices and provided immuniza-
tions for the past 43 years. In an 
effort to accommodate a ever-
growing student population, an 
extension to the main building 
was added a year and a half ago.

Although primary health care 
services are free for all registered 
UCSD students, many additional 
services are free for students who 
use the Student Health Insurance 
Plan, which provides coverage 
for undergraduates for $283 per 
quarter. Costs for urgent care are 
$10 for those with S.H.I.P. and 
$20 for those without — cheaper 
than health-care costs at many 
other UC and private colleges.

“I go to urgent care when 
I need medicine,” Sixth College 
senior Sarah Widner said. “I 
don’t have student health insur-
ance, but the copay is cheaper 
than my insurance, and it’s much 
more convenient.”

In order to keep costs down 

and balance low funding, Student 
Health closes its doors at 4:30 
p.m. Monday through Friday and 
stays closed on weekends.

“We do hear about issues 
like why we don’t stay open on 
Saturdays or provide after-hours 
care,” said Director of Health 
Education Debbie Pino-Saballet. 
“Students have to understand 
that for after-hours care, it’s not a 
matter of having a couple of staff 
members here. We would have to 
have x-ray, lab and really a full-
service clinic still operating after 
hours. We would have to give up 
something else unless we had 
more funding.”

Funding for Student Health  
is partially supported by student 
registration fees, which Student 
Affairs divides among many dif-
ferent student service depart-
ments. 

The other portion of the fund-
ing comes from service fees with-
in Student Health itself, based 
on whether or not the student 
has S.H.I.P. Urgent-care fees, 
appointment copays, pharmacy 
prescriptions, labs and x-rays all 
contribute to funding.

Some students lament Student 
Health’s delays: Online appoint-
ments contain a prewarning that 
the waits for scheduled consul-
tations can still be long during 
peak hours. Waits for urgent-care 
visits can stretch several hours; 
however, the wait system is set 
up like many major hospitals and 
private doctors, according to Jill 
Ballard, director of nursing.

“Waiting times are just the 
same [as other hospitals] if not 
better,” Ballard said. “The stu-
dents here are busy, and having 
to wait is a nuisance to them, but 
if they go out to other clinics and 
urgent care, they have to wait 

three or four hours if not more.”
According to Administrative 

Director of Student Health Lisa 
Russon, students experiencing 
college health care are unfamiliar 
with its bureaucracy.

“Students often have this as 
their first experience with health 
care, and for those of us who are 
a little more seasoned in dealing 
with health care in the outside 
world, we know the reallity of 
how that works,” Russon said. 
“There are a lot of issues that that 
brings about.”

Student Health has a process 
for dealing with student com-
plaints and suggestions. Along 
with an e-mail suggestion box 
located on the Student Health 
Web site, there are four com-
ment boxes located throughout 
the health center, attached with 
comment slips so patients can 
note problems with service and 
suggestions. Student Health also 
administers random patient sat-
isfaction surveys throughout the 
year. These records are reviewed 
weekly and discussed with staff 
when it is deemed necessary by 
the administration.

“I definitely welcome feed-
back,” Ballard said. “And when 
it’s specific, it’s helpful. If people 
have had uncomfortable situa-
tions then I would really like to 
sit down and talk with them. 
Then I can share that with staff 
and we can make things better. 
Anything that can be substantiat-
ed, or if a pattern developed over 
time, will result in staff being 
counseled over those issues.”

Student Health is particularly 
responsive to specific comments.

“When we get feedback from 
the comment slips those are

reviewed and then looked at if we 
need to change something, and if 
the student leaves their name and 
number then they are always con-
tacted,” said Ballard.

Another source of feedback for 
administrators are Student Health 
Advocates, 50 students chosen each 
Winter Quarter to work as part 
of the Health Education Program, 
teaching other students about health 
as well as working with nurses and 
doctors to further their education.

“Almost every hour we have a 
different Student Health Advocate 
work in the clinic,” Ballard said. “So 
they give us constant feedback if 
they see something that they think 
could be made to work differently. 
Once they are part of the staff, and 
see how things work from a staff 
member’s perspective, they have a 
better understanding and are very 
good about explaining it to other 
students as well — that everyone is 
trying their best.”

Still, according to both students 
and administrators, mistakes can 
be made. With such a large student 
population and only eight physi-
cians, five registered nurses, five 
nurse practitioners and six part-
time staff, it is easy to lose track of 
your patients.

“Sometimes I feel the doctors 
and nurses aren’t careful to be sure 
my diagnosis is what they think it 
is,” Widner said. “I feel like they 
don’t ever check any other possibili-
ties. I had an experience where my 
chart was incomplete. I returned 
several times for the same problem, 

but it wasn’t until the fourth time 
that the doctor looked more closely 
at my chart and started to figure out 
the real problem. They keep good 
records for the most part. I think it 
takes them a while to update them.”

But even with the frustrating 
visits, some students find comfort 
in the convenience of having an on-
campus health provider. 

“I like the people there much 
more than my family doctor who 
treats me like I don’t understand 
anything,” Widner said. “The staff is 
always very friendly and nice.  The 
doctors treat me like an intelligent 
person and respect my needs.”

Student opinions of the health 
center vary. Some, like Widner, 
accept its faults, and make good 
use of the convenient location and 
cheap prices. Others only hope for 
good health and vow not to go back 
unless absolutely necessary.

“If I can walk into Student 
Health myself, then I wouldn’t go to 
Student Health,” Jeong said. “I had 
to be carried in one time — that’s 
when they took me seriously.”

The contrasting opinions can all 
be attributed to unrealistic expecta-
tions, according to Ballard.

“Sometimes it’s a matter of mis-
understanding,” she said. “There are 
some expectations on our patients’ 
part that just don’t match reality. 
Our intentions are always to provide 
good care and to make people feel 
welcome and safe, and hopefully we 
get that message across.”

Camera Catches Drunken Escapades

Health-Care Experience

had mistaken my identity. He smiled 
and hissed a flabbergasted apology. As 
he walked back I heard his phone call: 
“Hey! I was chasing after Jordan and 
the strangest thing happened!”

I was ready for the bars. I decided to 
go with Moondoggies: no lines, decent 
lights and a lot of people. Inside, most 
were dancing or talking. Those that 
were alone had blank expressions and 
searching eyes. With urgency, I myself 
was scanning the room.

I normally hate bars or any loud set-
tings, but I was enjoying myself while 
taking photos alone. I was glad not to 
have to pay attention to a conversation, 
straining my ears and my voice just to 
be polite, having to focus on one person 
at a time rather than a whole room. I 
usually hate trying to cut through the 
cacophony but, with no one to speak to, 
the room seemed quieter.

Two girls sat across from me and I 
asked for a picture. One of them stuck 
their tongue out, adding a cockeye 

and the finger to make it clear she was 
young, drunk and happy about it. I set 
my camera on the table with the lens 
still trained on them. I took 10 more 
photos without them noticing.

Moondoggies’ lighting was worse 
than I had thought, but I did my best 
and an hour later I left to make sure my 
night’s transect was diversity.

As I went into Tiki for a live Rod 
Stewart song, I recognized the flan-
nel shirt and greasy hair of a guy who 
two bouncers were shoving into a taxi 
across the street. It was the angry man 
from the neighborhood, even drunker 
than he had been during the chase. The 
cab took him away as I walked West.

With bars closed at 1:30 a.m. there 
was a drunken fervor in the air — the 
energy accounted for plenty of freshly 
lit cigarettes and slurred phone calls 
in the cool air. A grey-haired deal-
er named Eddie was waiting outside 
Moondoggies, selling weed with the 
fervor of an old snake oil salesman and 
punching numbers into his phone with 

inebriated enthusiasm.
After pizza at Amore’s I start-

ed toward my car. Almost without 
noticing, I passed a couple lying on 
the sidewalk, making out in locked 
embrace. I thought about the fight I 
saw three hours before. Then I made 
a connection between everyone I had 
photographed. They were all hungry 
for something — whether it was sex, 
revenge, money, drugs or just Mexican 
food. Their desires were palpable and I 
wanted to record them in frames.

I was there too, though, and hun-
gry just the same. I had to want more 
than anyone else there, even, because I 
wanted to see everything at once. At 2 
a.m. I reached my car and it was almost 
with an afterthought that I was able to 
keep the night with me through photo-
graphs. I was satisfied just to be able to 
witness such a great night.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  11

significant as the Tritons beat the 
Golden Eagles by only one point ear-
lier in the season.

The Tritons started out the game 
with a three-point basket from 
Noud and held onto the lead for the 
entire game. Noud added two more 
three-pointers in the half, giving her 
11 points before halftime while the 
Golden Eagles managed to score 
only nine points as a team. Senior 
guard Alexis Mezzetta also scored 
a three-pointer to help the Tritons 
take a 25-9 lead into halftime. 

In the second half, both offenses 
picked up the pace with the Tritons 
still maintaining complete control 
of the game. UCSD scored early and 
often, shooting over 60 percent from 
the floor in the second half of the 
contest. With the Tritons holding a 
commanding lead over the Golden 
Eagles, UCSD was able to tap into its 
bench and play a total of 14 players.

By the end of the game, there 
were no starters in for UCSD but the 
scoring did not let up. The Tritons 
ended the night with a 37-point vic-
tory in which 12 players scored.

“It was neat to have everyone 
get in the game,” junior forward 
Michelle Osier said. “It was cool 
that there were a few girls that don’t 
see much playing time and they 
played really well … [CSULA] kept 
its starters in the game, so our team 
was going against their starters.”

Noud led the way for the Tritons 
with 22 points in just 23 minutes 
while no other UCSD player scored 
in double-digits. Senior center 
Krystle Flower came off the bench 
to collect five rebounds in 10 min-
utes of play, while sophomore guard 
Annette Ilg scored six points off the 
bench for the Tritons. With most of 
their recent contests having been 
closely contested battles, it was a 
nice change for the Tritons to get a 
blowout victory.

“I really think that kind of win 
can help the team in the future,” 
Noud said. “It lets everyone relax 
and play basketball instead of having 
to stress out.”

The Tritons have four more bas-
ketball games left in the regular 
season before they begin the play-
offs with the CCAA Championship 

Tournament. UCSD is currently 
tied for third place in the CCAA 
while remaining two games behind 
CSUSB and Chico State University, 
who are tied for first place. UCSD 
will have to win its remaining games 
and hope for losses from the top 
teams to have any chance to be the 
top seed and host the tournament.

UCSD will face CSUSB in its 
next game on Feb. 22 in what will 
be the Tritons’ biggest game before 
the playoffs. The Tritons face a team 
that they lost to earlier in the season 
in Cal Poly Pomona the next night. 
All of UCSD’s remaining games will 
be played on the road.

“Next weekend will be hard 
when we play the team that’s tied 
for first and a team that we lost to 
the first time,” Mezzetta said. “We 
need to win our next four games 
and hopefully host the first round of 
the tournament. It’s been a strange 
season with ups and downs, but we 
are playing our best basketball right 
now.”

team within one. Carlson called time-
out with just over one second left and 
drew up an inbounds play that got 
Husted the ball on the run and dribble 
out the final seconds.

“This came down to a grind-it-out 
finish,” Husted said. “These are the 
games that help us out down the line, 
these one-point victories. We have a 
great group of guys. The great thing 
about this team is we’re one unit. It’s just 
a great feeling [to be doing so well] and 
we hope to be able to keep it up.”

While converting only 9-of-25 
shots in the second-half, the Tritons 
went 8-of-15 from three-point range 
and committed only nine turnovers. 
Patterson led the way with 18 points 
and five rebounds, while Husted scored 
13 points in 18 minutes off the bench.

“We beat a very, very good team 

tonight,” Carlson said. “It wasn’t always 
pretty, but that’s what I think good 
teams do. They find a way to win.”

The Tritons will finish off their 
remaining regular season games on the 
road, beginning Feb. 22 at No. 19 Cal 
State San Bernardino and continuing 
Feb. 23 at Cal Poly Pomona. UCSD 
will have a chance to return home to 
host the quarterfinals of the CCAA 
Tournament if they end the season 
ranked in the conference’s top four.

“It’s been a great career here,” Allard 
said. “This is everything I could have 
dreamed of. Hopefully we’ll be back 
here for another home game. I just love 
my teammates; I love all the families and 
all the fans that come out to support us. 
I couldn’t ask for anything more.”

hold the Coyotes back, allowing them 
to score two straight goals — one of 
them off of a UCSD ejection — to 
give CSUSB a 5-3 lead with 4:09 left in 
the half. With 3:47 left in the period, 
sophomore utility Stephanie Heinrich 
converted a 6-on-5 opportunity from 
the weak-side wing to cut the Coyotes’ 
lead to one at intermission. 

“We really struggled in the first 
half of the game,” head coach Larry 
Sanders said. “We were missing shots 
on an open cage.”

The Tritons came out in the 
second half looking like a differ-
ent team on both sides of the ball. 
Within the first 15 seconds of the 
third period, the Tritons drew a 
CSUSB ejection on UCSD’s coun-
terattack. Hermann missed her shot 
attempt during UCSD’s advantage, 
but got her own rebound and scored 
to tie the game.

With less than five minutes left in 
the third period, the Tritons caught a 
break when one of CSUSB’s players 
was called for an illegal entry from the 
penalty corner, giving the Tritons an 
extra 6-on-5 opportunity. Bloom took 
advantage of the Coyotes’ mistake, 
netting a goal to give the Tritons a 
6-5 lead.

UCSD’s defense held the Coyotes 
scoreless for the rest of the quar-
ter and with 18 seconds left in the 
period, two-meter Judy Emaus scored 
the Tritons’ third straight goal to give 
UCSD a two-goal lead entering the 
final period.

The Tritons scored two more goals 
to open the fourth quarter, giving 
them a commanding five-goal advan-
tage and nearly assuring them victory. 
The Coyotes were able to add two 
scores, but the Tritons held on to post 
a 10-7 victory.

UCSD’s strong second half saved 
the Tritons from losing to the Coyotes 
for the first time in the school’s history. 
The Tritons outscored the Coyotes 6-1 
in the second half of the game, taking 
complete control of the contest.

“In the second half, we played 
like we should have been playing the 
whole time,” Sanders said. “We played 
better defense in the second half and 
we did a good job of putting the ball 
in the goal.”

Before the win against CSUSB, 
the Tritons went 2-2 at the Triton 
Invitational on Feb. 9 and Feb. 10, plac-
ing seventh out of 15 teams. UCSD suf-
fered a 12-11 overtime loss to Western 
Water Polo Association defending 
champion Loyola Marymount in the 
tournament.

“Our goal is to win conference this 
year and we just lost in sudden death 
to the team that won the champion-
ship last year,” Hockett said.

The Tritons have a long road ahead 
of them starting with a tournament at 
UC Irvine on Feb. 23 and Feb. 24. 
UCSD will have a tough start at the 
tournament, as it faces No. 2 Stanford 
University in its opening game.

SWIM & DIVE — The UCSD swim-
ming and diving teams traveled to 
Long Beach on Feb. 13 through 16 
for the four-day Pacific Collegiate 
Swimming Conference Championships 
and returned to San Diego without any 
titles. Last year’s conference champi-
ons lost their title this year, with the 
men coming in second and the women 
coming in third. 

“It was definitely tough defending 
the title this year,” junior Aubrey Panis 
said. “We swam the best we could and 
we had some great swims, but our team 
was too small to score enough points to 
win. However, we still got second on 
the men’s side and third on the women’s 
side and we’re really proud of that.” 

Even with the disappointing results, 
the Tritons had great individual and 
relay performances and qualified many 
new competitors to swim at nationals.

The team started day one with a 
mediocre showing, with both the men’s 
and women’s teams each winning just 
one relay. The team of junior Steven 
Hardy, senior Evan Hsiao and sopho-
mores Dan Perdew and Todd Langland 
won the 200 medley relay in 1:31.81. 
Meanwhile, the women won the 800 
freestyle relay in 7:34.57 with a team 
of juniors Panis and Shannon Simonds 
and freshmen Ashtyn Douglas and 
Anju Shimura. On the diving side, the 

men’s team placed second through fifth 
in the three-meter diving competition, 
led by senior Andrew Skewes in second 
and followed directly by sophomore 
Kevin Sullivan and seniors Jeff Bryant 
and Aaron Cantu.

Day two looked somewhat better 
with UCSD taking two more relays and 
an individual event. The men’s team 
went one-two in the 50 freestyle with 
Langland taking second in 20.83 and 

Perdew winning the event in 20.43. The 
men also took the 200 freestyle relay 
with a team of Langland, Hsiao, Perdew 
and freshman Brandon Marryatt. 
Their winning time was a 1:22.94, with 
Perdew anchoring the relay in a quick 
split of 19.76. The women also won the 
200 freestyle relay with Shimura, Panis, 
Simonds and junior Erinn Deters turn-
ing in a time of 1:35.11.

On day three, the Tritons had sev-
eral individual wins and a relay win. 
On the men’s side, Steven Hardy took 
the 100 backstroke in 51.42. For the 
women, junior Kendall Bohn won 
the 100 breaststroke in a 1:04.99 and 
Shimura won the 100 backstroke in 
a 56.87. The women’s team also won 
the 400 medley relay with a team of 
Shimura, Bohn, Deters and sophomore 
Karla Holman in a time of 3:50.73. 
Meanwhile Skewes, Sullivan, Cantu and 
Bryant took second through fifth once 
again in the men’s 1-meter diving.

On day four, the Tritons won sev-
eral events but it was too little too late 
to make a difference for the conference 
championship. Langland won the 100 
freestyle in a 45.41 while Shimura won 
the 200 backstroke in a time of 2:02.24. 
Also, Bohn won the 200 breaststroke in 
a 2:17.77. The women’s team finished 
out the weekend by winning the 400 
freestyle relay with a combination of 
Panis, Deters, Simonds and Shimura 
swimming a 3:28.28 to win the event.

Even though the Tritons did not 
defend their title as conference champi-
ons, they did come away from the meet 
focused on the positives. 

“Although we didn’t win, we came 
into conference and had a strong show-
ing,” Perdew said. “We qualified five 
people for nationals.”

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2008

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD 
men’s basketball team finished its final 
regular season home weekend with a 
split against conference opponents and 
a short stay tied atop the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association stand-
ings. The Tritons held on for their sixth 
straight victory, a 64-63 win over Cal 
State Los Angeles on Feb. 15. With 
that victory and an upset loss by Cal 
State San Bernardino, UCSD climbed 
to a first-place tie with the Coyotes in 
the CCAA. Unfortunately, the Tritons 
were unable to use the momentum 
from the Senior Night ceremony on 
Feb. 16 in their game against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, falling by a 61-46 
final score. UCSD now holds a 15-7 
overall record, 11-5 in league competi-
tion, and is tied with Humboldt State 
for second in the CCAA.

After honoring seniors Clint Allard, 
Jason Bull, Andrew Hatch, Henry 
Patterson and Jon Ward prior to the 
game, the Tritons found themselves 
in a defensive battle against CSUDH. 
With both teams playing physically, the 
Toros defensive pressure stalled UCSD’s 
offense. After a Jerrell Smith free throw 
put CSUDH up by nine, two Allard 
three-pointers in the final 3:22 of the 
half pulled the Tritons within two pos-
sessions, 27-21, heading to the break.

“[CSUDH’s] pressure got us out of 
what we do,” Allard said. “When we face 
a team that pressures all over the floor, 
we haven’t been very successful. That’s 
something we’ve got to work on.”

Allard opened the second-half scor-
ing for UCSD to pull the Tritons within 

four points. After three CSUDH free-
throws, the Tritons strung together a 
7-0 run from two layups by Henry 
Patterson and a three-pointer by junior 
guard Kelvin Kim that tied the game at 
30 with 15:22 left to play. Unfortunately, 
it would be the last tie for the Tritons, as 
head coach Chris Carlson’s squad was 
unable to take the lead. UCSD would 
stay within striking range for most of 
the half, but one of six blocked UCSD 
shots in the game led to a layup on the 
other end and gave the Toros their first-
double-digit lead of the game, 48-27, 
with 7:30 left to play. UCSD could get 
no closer than eight points and trailed 
by as many as 19 in the loss.

Neither team shot very well from 
the field, with CSUDH converting 40 
percent of their shots compared to 34.1 
percent for the Tritons. UCSD also 
struggled from the charity stripe, con-
verting only 11-of-23 attempts, com-
pared to 14-of-19 for the Toros. 

“We have all the respect in the world 
for [CSUDH],” said Allard, who scored 
14 points. “Since the last time they 
played us — a double-overtime UCSD 
win in Carson — they’ve been playing 
some of the best basketball in the league. 
They made shots and we didn’t.”

Patterson was the only other Triton 
in double-digits with 11 points, while 
also grabbing four boards. Sophomore 
guard Jordan Lawley led the team with 
eight rebounds in the game.

The Tritons dug themselves in 
another hole against CSULA on Feb. 
15. Scoring only three points in the first 
seven minutes of the game, the Tritons 
found themselves down by as much as 
eight. However, junior forward Darryl 
Lawlor’s three-pointer off an assist by 

junior center A.J. Maulhardt keyed a 
21-6 UCSD run. Junior guard Alan 
Husted connected on two threes dur-
ing that stretch and Patterson added 
a jumper and layups on consecutive 
possessions. The Golden Eagles closed 
within two points, but playing patient 
basketball allowed UCSD to stretch the 
lead to eight at the half.

“The toughest aspect was probably 
on the defensive end,” Lawley said. “We 
kind of wavered there in the beginning. 
We couldn’t really get a stop on their 
key players.”

CSULA, having defeated UCSD 
earlier in the season at home in a 
triple-overtime contest, climbed back 
in the second half. Holding the Tritons 
scoreless for almost four minutes, the 
Golden Eagles tied the game at 44 
with 12:21 left to play. Kim responded 
for UCSD with a three-pointer on the 
ensuing possession as the Tritons began 
to extend their lead again. 

The Tritons seemed in a favorable 
possession following a three-pointer 
from Husted as they held an eight-
point advantage, 60-52, with under six 
minutes to play. However, the Golden 
Eagles took advantage of four missed 
free-throws to climb back into the game, 
connecting on a three-pointer with 44 
seconds remaining to come within one 
possession, 64-61. After a missed layup 
by Kim on the other end, CSULA had 
a chance to tie. CSULA guard Vincent 
Camper, who was 2-of-3 from three-
point range at the time, missed on a 
tying opportunity, but Golden Eagles 
forward Demetrius Hazel grabbed the 
rebound and put it back in to pull the

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
UCSD women’s basketball team won 
both of its home games last week-
end, pushing its California Collegiate 
Athletic Association record to 11-5 
to remain in third place. The Tritons 
coasted to an easy 67-30 victory over 
Cal State Los Angeles on Feb. 15 
before winning a closer contest over 
Cal State Dominguez Hills on Feb. 16 
by a score of 75-64. UCSD has four 
games left in the regular season to 
make up the two games that separate 
them from first place in the confer-
ence.

Before its game against CSUDH, 
UCSD celebrated Senior Night as 
fans said goodbye to eight seniors 
playing the last home game of their 
careers. The Tritons opened up the 
night with five straight points from 
senior center Alexis Gaskin to begin 
what would prove to be an extremely 
close first half. 

The Tritons and Toros fought 
hard throughout the first period with 
Gaskin aiding the Tritons with 11 
first-half points. With both teams 
all tied up at 31-31 with one second 
remaining until halftime, senior for-
ward Meaghan Noud was fouled and 
hit both of her freethrows to give the 
Tritons a 33-31 lead at halftime.

UCSD stepped up its intensity 
from the start of the second half, 
driving hard to the basket and getting 
the Toros in foul trouble early. The 
Toros didn’t leave without a fight, 
however, hitting open jumpers and 
refusing to let the Tritons open up a 
sizeable lead. 

The Tritons held on to their slim 
lead throughout the second half, 
keeping control of the game’s tempo. 
With 3:37 left in the game, Noud hit a 
three-pointer that gave UCSD a 68-57 
lead the Tritons would not relinquish 
on their way to a 75-64 victory.

Noud led all scorers with 28 
points, with UCSD’s other four start-

WATER POLO — Though its record 
may not indicate it, the No. 16 UCSD 
women’s water polo team has played 
well in its first several games, and 
confidence from the coach and players 
has the Tritons poised to improve their 
record in upcoming contests. The 
Tritons exhibited their newfound atti-
tude in a home match against Cal State 
San Bernardino on Feb. 16, where they 
won 10-7. The win improves UCSD’s 
overall record to 4-7 with all of its loss-
es coming against ranked opponents.

The Tritons, who had won all 
of their previous 11 games against 
CSUSB, struggled in the first half 
against the Coyotes, falling behind 2-0 
after CSUSB’s first two possessions of 
the contest. With 6:15 left in the first 
quarter, senior utility Nicole Hermann 
netted a 6-on-5 goal from the strong-
side wing to cut the Coyote’s lead to 

2-1.
On the ensuing possession, the 

Tritons took advantage of another 
defensive miscue by the Coyotes as 
sophomore attacker Audra Bloom 
gained inside water and drew a pen-
