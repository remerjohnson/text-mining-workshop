Kelpers: the forgotten people 
of the Falklands blockade 
By J ACK EP STEIN and J,H. 

EVANS 
Pacific News rvice 

''I'm not British," said 
Graham Bound, 24-year-old 
editor of one of the Falkland 
Island' two monthly 
newspapers. 'Tm a Falkland 
islander." Although 
Bound's comment was made 
before the Argentine armed 
forces invaded the English 
colony in the south Atlantic, it 
characterized a quiet but 
growing schism between a 
traditional loyalty to the 
Britis h Commonwealth and a 
nascent independence move-
men t among an emerging 
generation of islander . 

"Everybody here shouts 
'God ble s t he Queen' and even 
refers to the United Kingdom 
a home" Bound noted. "But 
that's ridiculou . It' just a 
charade. " 

Although Bound does not 
represent the sentiment of the 
majority of the Falkland 
islanders, he does reflect the 
increasing uncertainty they 
have felt over being caught in 
the middle of a 150-year-old 
territorial dispute between 
England and Argentina. 

The 1,800 islanders of 
British stock, known as 
"Kelpers" (because of the vast 
kelp beds surrounding the 
islands), are considered simple 
and unsophisticated by both 
nations . Historically, they 
have been forgotten in the 
diplomatic wrangling and , 
more recently, ignored by the 
world press which refers to 
them as Britons. 

Since the islands had no 
indigenous people, the 
Argentines regard them as 
"transplanted persons" and 
have consistent ly denied them 
legal status. In fact, it wasn't 
until 1980 that the Kelpers 

were allowed to participate in 
United Nations -sponsored 
negotiations over the tatus of 
the island, and only then as 
part of the English team. 

While the Argentinian 
negated their legal residency 
position, England confused 
their status further under the 
controversial 1981 National 
Immigration Laws by denying 
them English citizenship 
unless their parents or 
paternal grandfat hers were 
born in the United Kingdon. 

Thi law, which applies to 
most KeIper, heightened a 
common sus picion that 
Whitehall ecretly wanted to 
relinquish sovereignt y to 
Argentina. 

The Kelpers believed 
England' alleged lack of 
interest in keeping the i lands 
was bound up in world 
sentiment against colonialism 
and the financial strain of 
s upporting the island 
logistically and militarily . 

Recent diplomatic initia-
tives by Britain lent credence 
to the accusations about 
Whitehall's "schemes," which 
included a lease-back 
arrangement whereby Argen-
tina would get sovereignty but 
England would lease back the 
islands in a Hong Kong-style 
arrangement. T his idea was 
the least popular of many that 
have been suggested to the 
Kelpers over the years. 

In fact, based on two weeks 
of interviews late last year in 
Port Stanley, the capital, and 
on outlying sheep ranches, 
these correspondents encoun-
tered an enormous diversity of 
opinion, ranging from 
accepting a lease -back 
agreement to demanding a 
permanent freeze on negoti -
ationns with their South 
American adversaries. 

However, in speaking with 
isolated shepherds, Chilean 
day laborers, owners, 
managers, young radicals and 
British civil servants, the 
consensu was that the 
islands should remain a 
colony. The more politically 
active, especially the young 
nationalists, expressed the 
need for the Kelpers to shed 
their colonial statu and 
unilaterally declare their 
independence. This was 
generally regarded by older 
residents to be an extreme and 
untenable position. 

Adding to Keiper fears have 
been rumor that the Falkland 
Island Co. (FIe), the largest 
landholder with 46 percen t of 
the land and the principal 
economic force in the wool-
dominated economy , wa 
pushing Britain toward a 
sett lemen t for strictly 
monetary purposes. Coalite, 
the London -based energy 
corporation which owns FIC, 
was believed to be eager for 
contracts for the reputed off-
shore petroleum reserves. 

After all , commented 
Falkland legislative council 
member Adrian Monk, "Oil is 
their business, isn't it." The 
dispute over t he isla nds' 
sovereignty could jeopardize 
any contracts to extract oil. 

Ironically, Argentina has 
argued that the FIC was 
play ing a major role in inhibi-
ting any agreement. The Bue-
nos Aires daily Clarill wrote in 
an editorial last year: "Only 
the monopoli tic interest of 
the FIC impedes the arrival of 
a legitimate agreement. What 
they fear most is that their 
reign will come to an end ." 

Argentine officials like to 
point to the tranglehold that 
the FIC has over the islands in

presentatIOn of the sit uation at 
Third. It 1. actually:>urpmmg 

that you are so emotionally

the seriousness of the 
situation. Surely you cannot 
believe that your opinion can 
in any way serve the people of 
color here at CSO. You cause 
controversy and confusion 
when t he most valuabl(' and 
needed t!lols are pat ience and 
understanding Your con-
tempt toward Dean Varga IS 

on ly an indication of your own 
confusion. People of color don't 
need your narrow-minded 
philosophies. 

People of color must be in

that minorities need to be led

Letter to the Editor 

Fee proposal subject of AS Council infighting 
Editor: 

The article written by Rob 
Howard in the April 5 Guard-
ian, concerning the proposal to 
make the mandatory Campus 
Activity Fee a voluntary pay-
ment, was inexcusably sim-
plistic and blatant in its 
purposeful editing for any 
reporter present to cover the 
submission of that proposal 
for AS Council approval. I can 
only assume that Mr. Howard 
was not present and therefore 
cannot be held responsible for 
his article's lack of insight into 
the events leading up to that 
meeting. While , as the author 
of this proposal, r was inter-
viewed briefly over the phone, 
my comments and explana-
tion obviously did not fit the 
theme of the article and were 
consequently omitted. I would 
now like to give the readers of 
the Guardian some idea of how 
the AS Council ha received 
this proposal as well as explain 
its intent. 

When WORC ( Work, 
Ownership, and Rights Com-
mittee) introduced the pro-
posal to the AS Council at the 
March 10 meeting there was a 
ilence followed by a cramble 

of comment from council 
member ranging from " I 
don't believe this is happen-
ing" to "If you don't like what 
I've been domg, vote me out!" 
It was argued that "we are 
forced to live in a representa-
tive government" and finally, 
quite as an afterthought, the 

wording wa ' questioned by 
Reggie Williams. As the 
aut hor of this proposal, and as 
the person who presented it to 
the council. all of these ques-
tions were directed towards 
me, yet r was shouted down 
each time I attempted to 
answer them. What I had 
hoped would be an open debate 
turned into a series of irra-
tional monologues, which 
denied a chance for their feeble 
premises to be revealed. I was 
not allowed to answer: "We 
shouldn't have to 'vote you 
out' to keep you from pending 
our money for whatever you 
support" of "don't tell us we're 
forced to live in a representa-
tivegovernment when, in fact, 
we are offering a proposal to 
eliminate force from the indi-
vidual' decision," and finally 
"don't act 0 surprised that 
this is happening becau e, 
believe it or not, there are stu-
dents who might not agree 
with everything the AS Coun-
cil does and will protest even 
though, since you already have 
our money, it's almost too 
late. " 

Well, as it turned out, Reggie 
Williams came up with the 
brilliant idea to question the 
"wording" and so po tponed 
further di cussion on the prop-
osal until "the Rules Commit-
tee" could meet the follow1Og 
Monday to "clear this up." It 
was moved to helve this issue 
to the Rules Committee, but 
not before Mark DIamond 

Attention! 

(Revelle College CouncIl) was 
laughed down when he asked, 
"If you (his fellow council 
members) don't pass thIS prop-
osal to be put on the ballot, 
what are you afraid of?" Those 
laughs were sickening because 
they represented the only reac-
tion given Lo a question whIch 
struck at the heart of the prob-
lem : the faith in the council's 
relat ions hip wi th the studen ts 
who they claim to represent. 

Now that I had some idea of 
the political games and road 
blocks my own AS Council 
was capable of, r solicited help 
in writing a totally "re-
worded" proposal. The final 
form of tpe propo al was 
drafted with the aid and appro-
val of 1) the Student Organiza-
tion Advisor, 2) the Vice· 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs at UCSD, and mo t Ig-

mflcantly 3) the AS~lstant 
Registrar of Voters of San 
Diego County. The "wording' 
was not to the letter-of-the·law 
and so. I thought. t he Rule~ 
CommIttee would have to 
approve it. Well, the council 
members of the Rules CommIt-
tee didn't waste theIr time un 
something as trivial as a sche-
duled meeting and so nobody 
showed up! The next morning 
I was told t hat this issue would 
then be resolved at the follow-
ing Council meeting. 

AS PreSIdent Jules (tnp-to-
Washington) Bagneris duly 
scolded the Rules Committee 
members for the no-s how at 
the start of that meeting and 
then the circus was once again 
underway. In two hours of 
debate over this propo~al the 
arguments dIdn't concern 
whether or not the indiVIdual 

student has the rwht to v{Jteon 
this Issue, but rather it was 
argued t hat if thIs proposal 
passes "it would change the 
AS a.' we know tt" and so the 
CouncIl voted against even giv-
109 the student ~ the choice to 
vote on this issue. Remember 
these are our representatIves 
not sImply betng slack In solic-
Iting student Input , but rather, 
actually fIghting that tnput! 

Finally, I was told that the 
councIl "had problems wah" 
the wording again and that 
thIs proposal might be "hard 
to implement" if passed and so 
I should talk to the registrar 
and adminIstration about hOll> 
to "do this ." The Issue was 
moved to Rules Committee 
once ag-dln. ThIS tIme the}

that the Argentine military

their democratic traditions 
and civil rights. 

"We don't deny we have 
problems," saId Richard 
Forrester, an Argentine 
foreign ministry spokesman, 
in an Interview last year. "But 
don't tell me the Kelpers have 
democracy. The farms are run 
like little kingdoms, and the 

FIC own half of everything." 
What Forrester was 

referring to was the fact that 
the Falklands always have 
been treated as a private profit

in England.

A ne\V rIse of the HUAC? 
By ADALIA LAVADO 

Can theHou eUn-American 
Activities Committee (HUAC) 
come to power once again? 
This was the question asked in 
a presentation given by Frank 
Wilkinson, director of the 
national Committee Against 
Repressive Legislation 
( CARL), on Monday night to 
Intere.;ted LTC !) studenh. 
According to Wilkinson (who 
was deepl y In\"ol\'ed 10 fight-
�ng HLIAC in the late fifties), 
fourteen member" of Congress 
have called to rcvlve HLTAC 
with a new focus on stopping 
terrorism and political 
subversion. 

In his presentation , called 
"HUAC - Born Again?", Mr. 
Wilkinson showed a HUAC 
propaganda film tiled "Opera-
tion Abolition" made in early 
1960. The film chronicles the 
May 12, 1960 trial of four 
a lleged communists by HUAC 

AS elections 
are coming! 
Voting starts 
May 6th 
and 7th 

r 

in San Francisco. In the film 
students were s hown protest-
ing against the trial and later 
trying to break into the cour-
troom. According to the HUAC 
narrator of the film these stu-
dents had been trained by 
unknow n communists to 
"incite agitation." ":-.lot . 0," 
saId Mr. Wilkinson, who had 
personall\ attended that trial. 
The ... tudents \\ 'reno! prote .. t-
Ing aga1O~t the injustlceof the 
t rial but rat her because the 
:WO or soeal~ in the cour-
troom allotted to them had 
been taken by another II1tcrest 
group. 

One thing the film illus-
trated was the lack of student 
support against HUAC in the 
late fifties. Even though the 
four alleged communist on 
trial in the film were teachers 
there was no student protest. 
It wasn't until FebruarY,l960, 
when two young black stu-

dents were refused servIce 10 a 
North Carolina Woolworth 's 
that students began organized 
rallies against political and 
racial di crimination. 

Mr. Wilkin on strongly 
urges students to get involved 
in the new fight aga10st 
threats to ci\i l libert l e ~ One 
recent example '" the Blitz 
Amendment (whIch was made 
1Oto a law 10 December. 1981 
and IS. In short. a IO\'a!t\ oath 
listed on 1 he Compreht'nslve 
Employment and Training Act 
(CET·\ ) job forms). "With stu-
dents Invol\'ed" he said, '\""e 
cou ld ~et the job done much 
faster. 

For those interested in the 
new fIght against HUAC who 
missed Monday 's presentation 
there will be another film 
s hown this Friday night in 
TLH 107 at 7:00 pm. The film 
will deal with the historical 
events of HUAC . 

AS activity fee 
continued from page 3 
iny of any collection of words 
and punctuations in the his-
tory of referendums. Every 
las t word of the draft was 
questioned ane rearranged 
until at one point they argued 
that the word "mandatory" 
was a "bad word" and that 
they "didn °t like it." "But 
that's what it is, it i a MAN-
DATORY FEE," [ argued. 

"But it sounds slanted," was 
the reply, "it might influence 
the stu dents." The last straw 
was when, in answer to my 
protest that this "wording" 
had been approved by the 
experts in the field, Reggie Wil-
liams of the "Committee" said, 
straight-faced, "It doesn't mat -

Bottle bill opposition UH parking issues 
But while the committees 

are reaching an agreement in 
the cost and quality of tudent 
parking in buil.ding the park· 
ing tructure, httle consensus 
has been reached over how 
much re. ponsibility the Medi-

Barrett said. 

SACRAMENTO - A 
coalition of labor, industry and 
recycling representatives 
opened its campaign against 
the bottle and can deposit 
initiative at the State Capitol 
la t week , a day after 
Secretary of State March Fong 
Eu announced the measure 
hac qualified for the November

"The forced depo it 
initiative is expensive . 
impractical, complicated and 
damaging to the state

executive vice president of t he 
California Chamber of

CARP visits UCSD;

Ian Ha ycro ft . visi ting 

Collegiate Associat ion for the 
Research of Principles (CARP) 
member, deli vered a short 
speech on Revelle Plaza, at 
around noon la t Tuesday. 
Haycroft drew on ly a very 
mall audience, which 

included a few CommIttee on 
olidarity for the People of EI 
alvador (C I PE ) members, 

who strongly oppose CARP's 
views. 

Outs ide of a display of a 
"Moonies - Fa cism" banner. 
a few boo , and occasional 
anti ·CARP remark s, the 
speech drew minimal 
response. The gathering was 
hardly remini cent of last 
year's CARP rally, entitled 
"Cuba Out of EI Salvador," 
which evoked a much larger 
and more heated response. 

Haycroft's speech focused 
upon the recent elections in EI

the 87 percent voter turnout in 
that country represents the 
"vote for democracy." and 
proves I he El a lvadoran 
people's support of the Duarte 
govern men t . 

In addition, Haycroft 
criticized CI PE and their 
support of the left-wing 
Federation of the Democratic 
Revolution (FOR) movement 
in EI Salvador. He denounced 
the FOR as a guerilla 
movement dedicated to 
violence, and as unrepresenta' 
tive of the will of the EI 
Salvadorean people. 

Concluding hi speech with 
a few remarks about CARP, a 
right·wing student organiza-
tion headed by Reverend Sun

expressed great pride in 
"being a Moonie." 

grocers a handling fee of at 
least one penny per container. 

Proponents claim s imilar 
laws in other states have 
reduced litter and solid waste. 
have increased recycling af}d 
have created job to handle the 
new influx of recycled 
cont a iner . Eight state 
currently have such laws. 

But opponent last week 
charged the bill would put only 
a small dent in litter c1ean·up 
eHorts while resu lting in 
increased co ts for consumers 
and a 10 s of killed jobs. 

Jim Quillin of the California 
Conference of Machinists 
labor organizatIOn warned the 
legislaton would "rai e the 
spectre of firing parents and 
hiring kids." While skilled 
workers in manu fact uring 
plants would lose their jobs, he 
sa id , new jobs would be 
created only in was hing, 
handling and sorti ng 
containers, es!>e nt ially 
mmimum wage v.ork. 

Henry Meyer. director of 
governmental relations for the 

orthern California Grocers 
Association. added the 
increased costs associated 
with implemen t ing the 
recycling would be pas ed on 
to consumers, co ting them 
$500 million per year. 

The unlikely labor and 
industry coalition opposed to 
the initiative face a grass 
roots campaign favoring it. 
Californians Against Waste, 
the primary support grouP. 
gathered more than 500,000 
petition signatures in 100 days 
to place the measure on the 
ballot. 

Student parking fee s may 
not be raised 50 percent next 
year to pay for the proposed 
parking struct ure at 1!mver· 
sity Hospital. accordmg to 
Larry Barrett. Director of Aux-
iliary Enterpri es. 

At a joint meeting between 
campus and Medical Center 
parking committees, a pay rate 
for the structure was dIS' 
cussed which would raise 
parking fees $1 to $1.50 more a 
month. According to Barrett, 
staff and faculty fees wi 11 be 
rai sed to cover the difference if 
student fees are not increased 
the full 50 percent. 

Meanwhile, Barrett said 
that both committees were 
"unanimous" that no pay rate 
scheme should make students 
pay the same amount for the 
"S" sticker that faculty and 
staff pay for t he "A" and "B" 
s licker. (Two of the pay rate 
schemes offered by the admin· 
istration were modeled after 
an 'equal pay but unequal 
parking privilege' ys tem u. ed 
at UC Riverside. UC frvine. 
and UC Santa Barbara.) 

The parking com mittees are 
presently considering 40 dif· 
ferent pay rate schemes for 
dividing costs between the 
general campus and the Hill · 
crest hos pital. Barrett 
explained that the 40 pay rate 
alternatives range from "two 
extremes" - one extreme 
would require the Medical 
Center be self- ufficient for 
their own parking structures. 
and the other would distribute 
costs equally to both the cam-
pu and hospital. (Currently 
- without the parking struc· 
ture debt s - University hospi -
tal employees pay fees at a 2:1 
ratio to the main campus). 

There will be a second meet-
ing bet ween the parking com-
mittees next Monday,

world today - starvation. Using the 
theme of a restaurant as a backdrop , 
the Waitre ss es blend factual 
information with visual imagery and 
sound In examining the problems of 
world hunger and unequal food 
dis tribution . Why is there stan'ation 
in the world when there is enough food 
to go around? I there a remedy for 
world hunger? The e are among 
questions that will be considered . 

The Waitresses have been 

presenting creative art performances 
since 1978, Using various artistic 
media, such a radio, televi ion, video, 
magazines, newspapers, exhibitions, 
lectures , and workshops, they have 
commented in t he past on some social 
issue concerning women in today's 
society, uch a work, financial tatu " 
tereotypes and sex ual harras. men!. 
They have now turned to the 

problem of world hunger. Current 
members of the group are: Anne 
Gauldin, Chutney Gunderson, Anne 
Mavor and Denise Yartitz, Admission

Kim Wilde and Kirsty 

MacColl are two you ngBrit ish 
singers (Wilde is 21, MacColl 
around 22) with famou s 
fathers - famous at least in 
so me musical circles - and 
energetic debut albums, both 
unabashedly pop and 
commercial in intent, but 
ot herwi e as different a night 
and day . 

Kim Wilde is thedaughterof 
Marty Wilde, one of Britain's 
early rockers. The elder 
Wi Ide ' wrote the lyrics for all 
the songs on Kim Wilde, which 
also happens to be produced 
and composed bv his son 

UCSD Theatre Presents 

Kim's brother - Ricky, who 
\Va ' a teen idol of sort s in the 
'60s. (U nlike hi American 
counterpart Rick Nelson, he 
never dropped the "y,") This 
unusua l musical incestuous· 
ness make for an intriguing, 
entertaining and irritating 
record , 

Kim Wilde i an almo tabs· 
cenely slick album, vibrant 
and well-executed but consist· 
ently contrived. For her part 
(not terribly large), the s inger 
Wilde has a nice voice and per· 
forms winningly, though with· 
out a great deal of personality 

The producer composer 
Wilde deals hea\llv in 'v nt hes· 
Izer. and electronic effe::ts. 
imparting a cold precision to 
the entire proceedings, The 
most interesting familial con· 
tribution comes from the Iyri· 
ci t Wilde, who has a certain 
flair for dumb teenage 
anthem ("Youn¥. Heroe ," 
"Kid in America '), pop bal· 
lads ("You 'll Never Be So 
Wrong," "Everything We 
Know") and techno·cosmic 
mumbo-jumbo ("Tuning In 
Tuning On"). Not surpris· 

K Ir l v M acC 011 come ... 
across as infinitely more su b-
stantial that Kim Wilde, 
whIch may be due In part to 
the influence of her father , 

cottish folk inger Ewan Mac·

misleading title - betrays no 
folk roots, but its pop is con-
sistently harp and inci~i\'e, 
sometimes serious (such as 
"Clock Goes Round:" " eems 
to me r wake up bored, seven 
days a week/ l need a chance to 
peak my mind, before I've got 

no mind to speak"), sometimes 
a little daft ("There' a Guy 
Works Down the Chip Shop 

wears He's Elvis" and "(I'm 
Ju t A Lonely, Alcoholic) Tee-
nager in Love," who e titles 
speak fOl ' themselves). but 
alway well-crafted and 
believable. 

MacColI doesn't posse s a 
great voice. but she seems to 
get everything she can - and 
somehow more - out of what 
she does have. 

Lou Ann Barton, on the 
other hand. does have a great 
voice. but she hasn't quite 
learned how to use it yet. The 
28-year·old American is a 
promising singer, who sounds 
remarkably black for a white 
person; unfortunately, she 
seems prematurely smug 
about her abilitie . trying to 
run before she's properly 
learned how to walk. 

On Old Enough Barton i 
reminiscent of a middling, late 
'60s soul singer - Carla Tho-
mas, say-and, similarly,he 
has been given good (but 

mostly u nexceplional) mate-
rial to record. 

The album " strongest link 
to that era is co-producer Jerry 
Wexler, for whom the '60 was 
a golden decade. His produc-
tion of Old Enough approaches 
the level of his cia sic work, 
but without outstanding song 
or a commanding singer -
which Wexler once had in the 
likes of Aretha Franklin and 
Dusty Springfield - his 
efforts are largely wasted . 

Perhaps Barton's limita-
tions are pointed up best in 
two covers of famous songs. 
She gives a happy, relaxed feel 
to her version of "Finger Pop-
pin' Time," but it pales next to 
t he ram bu nct ious one by Han k 
Ballard and the Midnighters. 
Far more disappointing - and 
somewhat embarrassing - is 
her attempt at the Chan leIs' 
gorgeous "Maybe," in trying 
to caputre the wonderfully 
young quality of Arlene 
Smith's original \'ocal, Barton 
comes uncomfortably close to 
caricature. 

For all its faults. though. 
Old ENough is by no mean a 
bad record, and Lou Ann Bar· 
ton should receive her shareof 
attentiun in the years to come.

'Letters' 
will open 
CTE plan 

Leiters Home, the first 
presentation of the California 
Theatre Ensemble will play 
Friday at 8 p.m. in the Warren 
Theatre. Directed by Michael 
Addi so n , UCSD Drama 
Department Chairman, Letters 
Home is drawn entirely from 
the correspondence between 
the poet Sylvia Plath and her 
mother in the years before 
Plath 's sudden uicide at the 
age of 30. 

The UCSD Guardian 

In this evocative play, as in 
Plath's only novel. The Bell 
Jar, there is a growing 
revelation of the loving 
relationship between mother 
and daughter. But there is also 
a growing understanding of 
the gaps that exist in that 
union, and realit ies that were 
kept private. The play is a 
recreation of a beautiful and 
yet pall1ful past and i a 
necessary journey of memory 
that Plath's mother must take 
as she em braces the fact of her 
daughter's death . 

Shankar to play at Fox 
World renowned Indian 

musicians Ravi Shankar and 
Alia Rakha will perform 
Saturday at the Fox Theatre. 
Shankar is a singular 
phenomenon in the classical 
music worlds of East and 
West. 

Best known as a sitar 
player, Shankar has al 0 done 
extensive compo ing for ballet 
and film in the US, Canada, 

Europe and his native India. 
His Concerto for Sitar and 
Orchestra was commiSSIOned 
by the New York Philhar 
monic. He has also published 
an autobIOgraphy entltk>d 
"Mv Music . Mv Life." 

ThIS show starts at 7:30 pm 
and tickets are $9.50 and 
$15.50. This i being spon-
sored by the Indo·American 
Cultural Society. 

The California Theatre

Drama faculty at UCSD who 
have worked together 
extensively over the past eight 
years as actors and directors, 
in addition to their other 
extensive professional theatre 
experience. They have now

Soccer stays undefeated 
By ELAINE WALLACE 

It' s a well-kept secret, 
something known 10 a core of 
loyal fans, a dedicated coach, 
his assistant and a group of 
enthusiastic women. 

It's the women's intercol-
legiate soccer team. 

After completing an 
ImpreSSI\e 6·1·1 season , the 
team and Coach Tre\ 
Conrique feel they desene 
recognition. 

'The girl. worked really 
hard off· eason," Conrique 
stated. " They dedicated 
themselves to a winning 
sea on." 

Concentration and disci-
pline are key traits of the team. 
Conrique noted their work on 
attitudes and fundamentals-
work they knew was needed 
for a winning season. Self-
discipline helped the women 
overcome injuries that 
plagued them throughout the 
season. 

These qualities ~ere

over Biola last Monday. It was 
an "awesome turnout ,"

"enior Slaff \Vriter 

Former Tnton softball star Rna l 'nbe last week went 
public regarding the confrontation bet \\ een her and Coach 
Dan Monteverde, statmg she never verbally a<,~aulted him, 

Earlier thIS month, Uribe ,>ubmltled a leiter to AthletIC 
Director Judith weet recommending Monteverde \ 
dismissal, citing th alleged confrontation and stating c;he 
feels physically threatened by him. 

Monteverde said Uribe msuIted and lambasted him and, 
in a moment of anger and fru~tratlOn , he told CrIbe, "Jf yOU 
were a guy, I'd deck YOU " He claims he Immediaielv 
realized what he had saId and apologized . -

1M over-lhe-line in the works 
By LARRY GOLDMAN 

Siaff Wril"r 
Intramurals are now well on 

their way as teams start 
fighting for a playoff berth. On 
Saturday, April 24, though, 
many players will gkip th~ir 
regular IM game s to 
participate in the seventh 
annual Miller High Life·San 
Diego Collegiate Over·the·Line 
Classic. 

Over·1 he·Line is a three-

person softball·type sport, 
played on the beach . Players 
pitch to their own team and 
the batter must hit the ball on 
the fly past a designated line, 
inside the foul boundarie . 
Three hits core a run. 

In the field the player try to 
catch the ball to achieve an 
out. Men cannot wear gloves, 
women can. According to Scott 
Berndes , IM co·director 
having no gloves "makes the

made a try, which would have 
ended the match in a 4-4 tie, 
but the referee called a knock· 
on. 

A knock·on is an illegal move 
in which the team intentional · 
Iy knocks the ball forward . 
Without that score, the game 
ended with the Tritons being 
beaten once more, 0·4. 

The last game ended on a 

happier note when the Tritons 
won it on a kick·off. The 
regulation game had ended in a 
0·0 deadlock, so in such a case 
the winner is determined by 
which team scores the most 
kicks. Each team is allowed to 
pick five players to dropkick, 
and the mo t uccess ful team 
wins. It was three kicks to 
none, and the Tritons pulled 
off their first and only victory 
of the tournament.

drives can be tough to handle,"

division , men's, women' and 
coed. It will be played at 
Mariner's Point . Mission Bay. 
The entry fee i $9 per team 
and every student who enters 
receives a free T·shirt. 

Trophies go to the top 
finishers in each division . The 
Classic is open to all 
universities and junior 
colleges. 

Sign · ups are in the 
recreation office (the 
department is co· ponsoring 
the event), and the deadline to 
sign up is Friday, April 23. 

In other 1M news: 
- not only soft ball and 

volleyball have programs that 
have had phenomenal growth, 
The Ultimate Frisbee 
program, just one year old, had 
49 teams sign up thi year in 
all divisions. This is a 75 
percent increase from the 28 
teams which participated last 
year.

rest of the tournament. She 
says Monteverde thought s he 
was phoning to report the 
conf rontation and it was then 
he howed up and apologized. 
She says Monteverde told her 
it wa a moment of frustration 
and anger - as he told The 
Guardian - but that he added 
that at the moment he 
regressed to his chi ldhood 
when he had to fight to 
survive. 

Despite statements quoted 
in a previous Guardian story, 
Uribe says she got along well 
with the re t of the team. The 
team voted her and catcher 
Vanessa Davis team captains 
but Uribe says she declined. 

She says there was "a power 
thing" between her and Davis. 
which probably accounts for 
statements by Davis concern-
ing Uribe's lack of rapport 
with the club. She says Davis 
tried to tell her what to throw 
during a game. Uribe finally 
called Davis to the mound 
during a game to tell her s he 
(Uribe) knew how to pitch, but 
Davis walked off before she 
could finish the statement. 

Later, Uribe says Monte· 
verde told her, "Don't you ever 
tell Van essa not to give you a 
s ignal. " 

"I got along very well with 
the rest of t he team," she says. 

Uri be responded to accusa' 
li ons she failed to show up for 
pracllce. stat ing she mi ssed 
pra c tl ce~ "" hen a class 
conflicted with them, when 
she was SIck and once when 
she had a flat tire on the 
freeway, In all cases, she 
informed Monteverde. 

She did not s how up for 
Casino Night after discussing 
the matter with Monteverde, 
s he said . Uribe. who lives in 
Capistrano, said Monteverde 
excused her from Casino Night 
because s he would have had to 
drive home from a double 
header in Santa Barbara and 
then to UC an Diego all for 
two hours of ca rrying a tray at 
the fund raiser. She had not 
pitched a double header in two 
years , she said, and was tired 
and needed to rest and ice her 
arm , 

Unbe said she would not 
warm up with the team 
because she had a special 
routine she had to go through 
to get ready to pitch . Man y 

times the Tritons arrived at a 
road game barely in time to 
play , s he said . She had to 
s tretch out and then warm up 
with a game ball by throwing 
to another player who wa not 
s lated to start. 

For Uribe, the decis ion to 
report Monteverde's act came 
the day of the incident at the 
Redlands Tournament. Finals 
were the following week, 
however , and he decided to 
devote all her energies to them, 

''I'm not the type of person 
who can concentrate on what I 
have to do and put everything 
else out of my mind," she says. 
The week after finals, she 
went in to report the incident 
to A thletic Director Judy 
Sweet, but Sweet was on 
vacation at the time, 

She spoke with Monteverde 
who asked her to keep the 
issue within the confines of 
the team, she ays. When s he 
told him s he planned to report 
it to Sweet, Monteverde aid 
s he couldn 't play softball. 

" I have never quit any team. 
I am not a qu itter ," Uribe 
emphasized in response to The 
Guardian headline, "Star 
Pitcher Uribe Quits Team ." 

"I was forced off the team, If 
I were a quitter, I would not be 
making this stand. " 

She said she failed to show 
up for a meeting with Sweet 
and Monteverde because she 
did not wanl to put hersel f In 
that SItuation, She s aId she 
felt not hing productive would 
come of it and that , since 
Monteverde and Sweet had 
made a decision, she felt the 
two wou Id try to convince her 
to drop it. 

The meeting had been 
scheduled on her birthday, she 
added , and she had plans and 
"was not about to meet with 
them" on her birthday. 

As it stands now, Unbe 
declines to comment on what 
action s he plans to take next. 

Monteverde declined to 
comment on Uribe's allega-
tions, calling it a "waste of our 
time 10 continue what seems to 
be turning into melodramaor a 
soap opera." 

" I don 't know whal more 
she wants from me. I have 
offered to talk things over wit h 
her. I have given her a written 
apology. 

"It is not fair for her to 
continue this without sitting 
down with me. If she's scared. 
with another person present ," 
Monteverde said . He said there 
can be no progress made in 
resolving a problem without a 
meeting. It eems , he said , he 
doe not want to discuss the 
matter. "She wants to ee me 
terminated ," 

Monteverde said he talked 
with Uribe once for five 
minutes last week and again 
told her, "We really have to s it 
down and talk this over." He 
says she replied there is 
nothing to talk over and that 
"It's all over." 

What is the motive behind 
all this?" he said . "If she is 
frustrated by me, again, I 
apologize. It' s as if she is 
saying she knows it's over so 
'There. I've struck at you 
again.'" 

" If someone wants to end it, 
just meet or s top commen· 
ting," Monteverde sa id , 
refusing to re pond to the 
allegations, 

" If I'm being written up as a 
tyrant and a coach whodoesn't 
care about his players, go to 
the game. . The players are 
inspired at all t imes. It IS a 
two-fold reflection, a reflection 
of the heart and desire to play 
and one that the coach is 
promoting (that inspiration ). 

" I do that in the pract ice~ 
and In t he ~ames." 

Sweet told The CuardwlI 
s he had severely repnmanded 
Monteverde and did not want 
to make a n y further 
s tatements. S he said I he 
Guardian had reported the 
in cident and beyond that , the 
matter s hould be taken care of 
within the Athletic Depart· 
ment. 

Monteverde ca lled th e 
Guardian's handling of the 
story "irresponsible." He said 
the article hindered any 
progress which may have 
come about. "There is no way 
Rita will ever come back now." 

Uribe, however, ays that is 
untrue. She says she n ver 
wanted to in volve the team In 
the malter, and made it a point 
never to tell anyone what had 
occurred or what "he planned 
to do. 

"I can play softba ll for 
{]CSl) , I cannot play for Dan 
Montev 'rde," she said

ENGINEERING FUTURE. 

How many corporations would be willing to 
pay you over $1000 a month during your 
junior and, enior years just so you'd join the 
company after graduation? Under a special 
Navy program we're doing just that. It's 
called the Nuclear Propulsion Officer 
Candidate-College Program. And under it, 
you ']] not only get great pay during your 
junior and senior years, but after graduation 
you'll receive a year of valuable graduate-level 
training that is not available from any other 
employer. 

If you are a junior or senior majoring in math, 
engineering or physical sciences, find out more 
today. And let your career payoff while still in 
college.
