Student Affairs 

plans to provide all ..

to student services 

By LISA MAK 
Contributing Writer 

Changes to the Office of Student 
Affairs Web page will be made over 
the next five years in an effort to 
make it easier for UCSD srudents to 
access information and make cam-
pus-relatl'd transactions online. 

The project, called Plan 724, is 
scheduled for completion in 2007. 
Its overall goal is to make online 
uperations more convenient for 
srudents, allowing them to access 
the site 24 hours a day, seven days 
a week. 

"It should be an intelligent, 
more efficient system," said Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph Watson, who emphasized 
that increased student convenience 
is the main objective of the plan. 

According to Watson, there are 
several reasons for the changes 
being made. 

"The campus population has 
increased from 20,000 to 30,000," 
he said. "We must plan to accom-
modate changes in the student 
body and in the environment. " 

Many students function at 
hours other than the normal eight 
to five, so having 24-hour online 
service would be timelier for them. 

Students will be able to perform 
tasks via the computer, eliminating 
the need to stand in long lines, go 
through bureaucratic forms or wait 
indefinitely for answers to their 
questions. 

"Our students are more techno-
logically savvy now," said Darlene 
Willis , executive administrative 
officer for new initiatives and com-
munity relations, "and we're trying 
to catch up with them. I'd rather 
do things online than have to go 
out and do them, but the Internet 
here doesn't work a lot," said Jenny 
Rhymer, a Thurgood Marshall 
College freshman. 

According to Watson, there will 
be four "generations" to Plan 724. 
After generation one, all depart-
ments of Student Affairs will have 
working Web pages to provide 
basic information. Many depart-
ments currently have no technical 
support at all, malcing it impossible 
to produce viable Web pages. 

After generation two, students 
will be able to make basic transac-
tions online, such as paying bills 
and getting instant feedback on

Troupe resigns as Calif. poet laureate 
UCSD literature professor admits falsifying bachelor's degree 

By DANIEL WAn5 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD literature professor 
Quincy Troupe resigned from his 
post as the nominee for 
California's first poet laureate on 
Oct. 18, after admitting to falsify-
ing information on his resume. 

Troupe had claimed on his 
resume that he graduated from 
Grambling State University in 
Louisiana with a bachelor's 
degree, a statement he now admits 
was incorrect. 

"I deeply regret my ill-advised 
decision to include inaccurate 
information on my curriculum 
vitae," Troupe said in a statement 
released by the governor's office. 

"While 1 attended Grambling 
College, I never earned a college 
degree." 

Troupe, 62, had been appointed 
poet laureate by Gov. Gray Davis 
in June over 55 other candidates. 
The position was awaiting confir-
mation by the California State 
Senate when the discrepancy arose 
during a routine background 
check. The governor's office has 
not decided how it will replace 
Troupe. 

A mention of the falsified degree 
appeared in UCSD's records as 
well, according to Vice Chancellor 
of External Relations James 
Langley. However, according to 
Langley, the discrepancy was not 
discovered earlier because an in-

Prospective students, San 
Diegans and many other visitors 
were present at the annual UCSD 
Open House on Oct. 19, seeking 
information about the university 
and looking to experience the 
campus. 

"1 really like the area here," 

said high school senior Erin 
Toffelmier. "It also seems like a 
well-rounded school that will give 
me a lot of options." 

Presentations were given 
throughout the day for those who 
would like to attend UCSD as a

Run/Walk for Scholars raised 
over $190,000 for UCSD under-
graduate scholarships and filled 
RIMAC Field with more than 
900 participants on Oct. 18, in 
what organizers believe was the 
largest turnout ever for the event. 

"We do believe that this is the 
most people we've ever had," said 
Brian Daly, director of develop-
ment for student affairs. 

Before the race commenced, 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
spoke to the crowd and reiterated 

his challenge to the UCSD stu-
dent body. 

"If any of you are fee ling par-
ticularly fast today, every srudent 
who beats me can get $25 out of 
my pocket for srudent scholar-
ships," Dynes said . 

Dynes also stipulated that anv 
woman who beat his wife, protes-
sor Frances Dvnes-Hellman , 
would also earn an'other $25 from 
her toward the undergraduate 
scholarships.

BRIEFLY 
UCLA scholars complete 
California Dryden Project 

After 53 years and 12,217 pages, schol· 
ars based at UCLA have finished the 
California Dryden PrOjed, an attempt to 
publish the most complete annotated and 
corrected collection of 17th-century English 
wnter John Dryden's works to date. 

The 20·volume set IS being billed as the 
most complete overhaul of Dryden's oeu· 
vre since the Scottish poet and novelist Sir 
Walter Scott produced a complete edition 
In 1808. 

The prOjed was staffed by 18 scholars -
half of whom are from UCLA - who spent 
five decades searching for Dryden's ulti· 
mate Intentions among variations in hun· 
dreds of editions of his works. 

The final volume, which is the seventh 
In the collection and titled "The Works of 
John Dryden Volume VII: Poems, 
1697-1700," will be published by the 
University of California Press later this year. 
Already, one third of the press run has been 
sold 

Born 15 years after William 
Sha espeare's death, John Dryden wrote 
28 plays and was named poet laureate of 
England In 1670. By his death in 1700, he 
was Widely conSidered the most famous 
English wnter of hiS generation. 

UCLA's William Andrews Clark Memorial 
Library, which specializes in 17th and 1 Bth 
century literature, is home to the largest 
Dryden collection outside the British Library 
and inspired faculty to embark on the pro· 
Jed In 1949. UC Press published the first 
volume of the collection in 1956. 

One in 5 tumors found by

to a multi·state study led by UC San Francisco 
resea rchers. 

The findings were published in the Oct. 
16 Issue of the Journal of the Notional 
Cancer Institute. 

Researchers found that in some women, 
DOS diagnosis increases with age. Overall, 
one In every 1,300 screening mammo-
grams results in a diagnosis of DOS. 

The findings were based using the clini-

to 84 who had mammograms in 1996 and 
1997. Of 3,266 cases of breast cancer, 
2,675 were invasive and 591 were DOS. 

Breast cancer is the second·leading 
cause of cancer deaths in women. An esti· 
mated 203,500 women in the United 
States will be diagnosed with invasive breast 
cancer in 2002 and about 39,600 will die of 
the disease during the year.

Students file lawsuit 
against D.C. for protest 

(U·WIRE) WASHINGTON, D.C. - Seven 
George Washington University students, 
many of them student journafists, filed a 
lawsuit against the city of Washington, D.C., 
on Oct. 14 after they were arrested during 
last month's Intemational Monetary Fund 
and World Bank protests. 

. The stu~ents are ar~uing that their con-
stitutional nghts were Violated as journalists 
and observers when they were swept up in 
a mass arrest in Pershing Park, along with 
hundreds of political advocates. 

The lawsuit alleges that authorities violat-
ed the students' rights under the First Fourth 
and Fifth Amendments and accuses Distrid 
of Columbia police of 'abUSive confinement' 
and denying the students access to counsel. 

This marks the first suit filed after the 
Sept. 27 incident, in which police in riot gear 
confined hundreds of protesters, journalists 
and observers in downtown Washington, 
D.C., for over two hours and then arrested 
them. Many of those arrested spent hours in 
temporary lails, handcuffed ankle to wrist 

Over half the plaintiffs are George 
Washington Law School students who 
were observing for the National Lawyers 
Guild at the time of their arrest. The others 
are joumalists and photographers for one 
of the GW campus newspapers, The 
Hatchet. 

"These students had a Constitutional 
right to observe and report on [the 
protestsl ," said attorney Daniel Schwartz, 
who is representing the students on a pro-
bono basis. 

D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey is 
defending the arrests that took place during 
the protests. 

"If they filed a suit, that's their right, and 
we'll answer it when the time comes," 
Ramsey told the Washington Post. 'I don't 
have any problem with any of the actions 
taken during IMF weekend:

OPINION 

The Principles of Community is a good 
guideline for behavior at UCSD 

By LOGAN GOH 
S taft Writer 

The Crusades probably would not have 
happened if there was no Bible. The 
Inquisition probably would not have tor-
tured thousands if Jesus hadn't preached of 
loving thy neighbor. Most recently, the 
Sept. 11 attacks would not have been carried 
out if the Koran had not been written. Does 
this make the Bible bad? Do atrocities com-
mitted in the name of Christ make the Ten 
Commandments evil ? 

I don't think so. 
Simila Iy, even though the UCSD 

Principles of Community has recently been 
used to justify the dubious actions against 
The Koala and the Che Cafe Collective, this 
does not mean that there is anything wrong 
with the principles themselves. The princi-
ples speak directly about cele-

problems. The problems inherent to wide-
spread violence based on prejudice should 
be easily apparent; other than the possible 
loss of life and the definite cost to the econ-
omy, there is the climate of fear that will 
descend over the ;>eople, and society loses 
the contribution of talented people from 
the minorities. 

Frankly, there's not much to be said 
against the Principles of Community. They 
are not rules or laws, but guidelines to 
encourage friendlier behavior among the 
UCSD community. It may perhaps be con-
sidered obvious that it is a good idea to be 
nice , but by putting this on one document, 
we allow everybody to have the same under-
standing of what it means to be "nice to each 
other." By having the Principles of 
Community, we are also able to see when 
someone is violating the boundaries of 

"nice" more clearly, which 
allows US to be more lucid about brating diversiry, not persecut-

ing it. If the meaning behind the 
principles has been misi nter-
preted, thi s does not affect the 
spi rit behind the principl es. The 
UCSD Principles of 
Community should be followed 

PRO enforcement. The sad truth of the world is that it is nor possible to have absolute freedom. Even a docu-
ment like the Principles of 

not just by the members of 
UCSD, but by everyone who desires a bet-
ter world. 

The principles are not a set of laws, or

Document does not adequately value 
necessary freedom of expression 
By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 

Opinion Editor 

At first glance, the UCSD Principles of 
Community is a genial document. It reaf-
firms the values that one would expect a lib-
eral-minded university to ascribe to: cele-
bration of individual talents, ethnic and ide-
ological diversity, tolerance of differences 
and respect for others among them. 

However, this document is flawed in its 
priorities and its hypocrisy; it doesn't attach a 
high enough value to truly free expression, 
and what limited value it does give to free 
expression is consistently undermined by an 
administration with a bad track record where 
the First Amendment is concerned. 

The Principles of Community is a list of 
values that UCSD members are expected to 
uphold in order to create and foster a cohe-
sive - you guessed it - com-

to quash any speech that isn't courteous, 
sensitive or respectful. 

Several years ago, a student was moved to 
place a sign in a residence hall window that 
said "Fuck Netanyahu and Pinochet." 
UCSD told him to remove it. He refused, 
and a lawsuit ensued, with the student claim-
ing that his First Amendment rights were 
being abridged. In the end, tile university 
backed off. The student's speech was cer-
tainly far from "courteous," but political 
statements like that are a positive contribu-
tion to the UCSD community. T he princi -
ples, therefore, disallow something th at 
increases debate and discourse on campus -
something that helps our sense of communi-
ty; essentially, they're shooting themselves 
in the foot. 

Last year, The Koalll found itself in hot 
water because of "offensive" jokes targeted 

against women and minorities. 
munity on this campus. The list 
of 10 principles predominately 
"affirms," "values" and 
"acknowledges" issues related to 
diversiry. This is all well and 
good, and certainly such issues 
as tolerance and understanding 

(ON Its jokes about the murder of Danielle Van Dam and subse-quent trial prompted Chancellor Robert C. Dynes to speak out against the publication. C learly, 
neither incident was an example 

of differences should be brought 
to the forefront of our collective conscious-
ness. 

The seventh principle On the list reads, 
"We affirm the right to freedom of expres-
sion at UCSD. W~ promote open expression 
of our individuality and our diversity within 
the bounds of courtesy, sensitivity, confiden-
tiality and respect." This is where things 
start to get sticky. 

Essentially, what this principle "affirms" 
is something often heard from talking heads 
on this campus: "Freedom of speech is great, 
but .... " 

There is no "but." Freedom of expression 
doesn't allow for any limitations of political 
correctness - limited freedom is no free-
dom at all , merely an allowance given by the 
powers that be; a courtesy, if you will. The 
past few years have shown UCSD's adminis-
tration 2nd many students to he all too eager 

of "sensitive" expression on the 
part of The Knalll - but if UCSD 

is serious about valuing diverse points of 
view, as they claim to be in the principles, we 
must also accept diverse senses of humor. 

The harsh reality of life in this day and 
age is that some goals cannot be achieved 
through courtesy, sensitivity and respect; 
sometimes, art or political expression needs 
to shock in order to inform or to move. 
Sometimes, entertainment appeals not to 
"counesy, sensitivity and respect" because, 
frankly, those three things are not very 
entertaining. 

It is ironic yet telling that these noble 
goals of diversity should be found under the 
heading of community, when "community" 
is by definition held together by things peo-
ple have in common. Apparently, UCSD 
wants us all to share in its visiotl of diYersity 
- while anything outside that concept is not 
free to be expressed .

UCSD's profs mostly liberal 
Political imbalance detrimental to students 

By DUSTIN FRELICH 
Staff Writer 

Six is the magic number, but 
what importance does rhat num-
ber carry for UCSD students? A 
very biased one, according to 
American Enterprise magazi ne. In 
a recent study, the magazine found 
that colleges are all but complete-
ly overflowing with a certain kind 
of professor. So if you're pursuing 
a Bachelor of Arts, listen up. 

Believe it or not, when it comes 
to the liberal arts, there are twO 
sides to just about every issue. And 
while you may be given the argu-
ments from both sides in class, 
more emphasis can be put on one 
side than the other. Unlike entry-
level science and math, the sup-
posed golden tru ths heard in your 
political science classes - or any 
other liberal arts classes, for that 
Illatter - Illay not be so golden 
after all. Yes, they're opinions -
Informed, bUI opinions nonethe-
less. 

While some may argue that 
facts are facts, what happens when 
not all the facts are in the curricu-
lum, when some half-truths are 
disingenuously altered to seem 
golden, or when some icleas are 
given more intellecrual merit than 
others? This means that while you 
might think your teacher's words 
- and eve n assigned texts that are 
written by opinionated people 
themse lves - are und isputed , 
there could be a completely differ-
ent side to the story. 

And that goes for sources from 
both sides of the political spec-
trum, liberal or conservative. 
However, on our college campus, 

CAMPUS 
the other side just happens to be 
conserva tism. 

American Enterprise magazine 
tOok it upon themselves to cross-
reference party registration (by 
inspecting boards of elections) with 
professor listings at major universi-
ties across the United States. And 
although in some places the study 
was limited by available records, the 
big picture is' evident: T he number 
of teachers registered with a parry 
on the left (Democrat, Green, etc.) 
vastly outnumber those registered 
with a party on the right 
(Republican, Libertarian, etc.). 

Here at UCSD, out of a total 
105 for which records were avail-
able, the number of professors reg-
istered on the right is six. Six! The 
number of professors registered on 
the left: 99. Yes, you read it right. 
We hardly have what you could call 
a politi('l\lIy "diverse" professorship. 

Here 's what the UC Office of 
the President has to say about 
diversity: "Faculty ... affirmative 
action and diversity ... develops, 
implements, coordinates and 
manages university-wide out-

... UNIVERSITY CENTERS CD 
, ........ -..... 

reach, recruitment and retention 
efforts intended to enh ance the 
diver iry of the university's ... fac-
ulry populations." 

I happen to believe in the 
increasingly archaic school of 
thought that if you insti tute a poli-
cy it should be consistent. If the UC 
system wants to implement an affi r-
mative action diversity policy, why 
does it not apply to diverse political 
backgrounds, why only race? 

Universities, the champions of 
diversity, have shown their true 
colors: Diversity doesn't apply 
when it comes to conservative 
teachers . Diversity? Well, only for 
the color of your skin or your gen-
der. How about we all get past skin 
color and throwing around terms 
like "racist" or "sexist" whenever 
anyone disagrees with what we 
believe) 

Furthermore, of the teachers 
su rveyed at th e UC Berkeley, 
seve n teachers were registered on 
the right, compared with 59 on 
the left. At the Universiry of 
Cali forn ia at Santa Barbara, one 
percent of surveyed teachers are 
registered on the right. One per-
cent! At UCLA, it 's slightly higher 
at six percent. 

But it doesn't stop with the UC 
campuses. The sa me problem 
plagues Harvard 's political science 
department (29 on the left, one on 
the right; four percent on the right 
overall), Will ia ms College (four 
on the right out of over 200 total), 
Stanford (II percent on the right) 
and Cornell (three percent on the 
right) . The list goes on and on.

+11 have you know that Bill 

Clinton was one of the best presi-
dents your country ever had!" 
Emily said emphatica lly. "You have 
no idea how much he helped us and 
the problems in Northern Ireland." 

Despite my disagreement, 
Emily is very passionate about this 
subject, as are most of the frish. I 
cannot blame them. Certainly, the 
vast influence of the United States, 
under command of one of 
America 's most in famous figures, 
brought a shaky but relative peace 
to the province of Ulster in Ireland. 

"You have to understand that 
many American strongly disagreed 
with hi s domestic policy and what 
he accomplished on America n soil, 
despite the good he did for Ulster," 
I reply, wondering if she knows 
something about American politics 
that I don't. Apparently not, and 
she continues on about the great 
foreign policy that Cl in ton had . 
Clearly, according to Emily and the 
many Irish citizens who agree with 
her, Clinton did the right thing by 
invo lving the American govern-
ment in another country's affairs to 
obtain peace in Northern Ireland. 

As understandable as t.his is, 
many places were not so enthusias-
tic about Clinton's foreign. policy. 
Many inhabitants of Bosnia were 
not as pleased. Neither were many 
residents of Somalia. 

Regardless of Clinton 's specific 

decisions, this brings lip an impur-
tant matter that has heen tested In 
Ireland again in the last few day' . 
The question of how much 
America should use its intlucncc on 
the world IS alwavs ur\dcr debare. 
There is no uillversal answer 
because sometimes there ",dl be .In 
obligation of the United tates to 
get involved and other times, we 
should leave the world alone. 
However, in the most recent crisis 
in Uls ter, the Bush Administration 
made the right decision. 

In the last of couple weeks, after 
the police raided Sinn Fein offices 
in Belfast, there have been poli tical 
storms in Northern Ireland. , Inn 
Fein has been accu ed uf haVing 
sensitive letters that documc:nt th~ 
movements of promlilent nIOI1l'(>

ous documenrs that could alll pa r.l-
military groups. Everyone knell" 
Sinn Fein had it coming; the ultra-
Republican parry has been III [rou-
ble for ties to the IRA before. It W:I 
just a matter of time before It got In 
trouble again. Many of the Irish, .It 
least in the Republic, arc rathc::r 
resigned to Sinn Fein wrongdolllgs. 

But the issues have made ripples 
large enough to get a reaction from 
the U.S. government, especially 
with talk of throwing out the Good 
Friday agreements With respect to 
punishing Sinn Fein . The Bush 
administration has now sa id that 
whil e action needs to be taken 
against Sinn Fein by the Brimh 
government, aides of the Blish 
administration made clear that it 
would nOt become closely involved 
in this situation. Belfast would have 
to Ilgure this one out on its own.

6 OPINION THE UCSD G UARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2002 

LETTER TO THE EDITOR Pro: Principles are valid 
despite abuses of them 

Israel's human rights 
record merits divestment 

Editor. 
I am writing concerning Dustin 

Frehch's article against the divest-
IIlcnr campaign (Oct. 14 issue of the 
G/lardlflll ). How could Israe l, a 
country that considers itself democ-
ratic. disrespect human rights?.It is a 
known fact dlat Israel is not comply-
ing with several international laws 

regard ing human ri ghts. Just to 
name a few, Israel violates United 
Nations Resolution 194, which calls 
for the respect of refugee rights to 
return to their former lands or be 
compensated for their losses, as 
agreed by the Palestinians and 
Israelis in bilateral negotiations. 
Another is the violation of United 

ations Resolution 242, which 
notes the inadmissibili ty of the 
acquisition of territory by war and 

. letters musr be no longer thai 500 1\tV'm; typed and 

calls fo r wi thdrawal of Israeli armed 
forces from occupied territories. 

T he object of the UC Divest peti-
tion is simple: to stop the inhumane 
activities Israelis are cOllUnitting. I 
believe the UC Divest petition is one 
step toward encouraging the U.S. 
goverrunent and the govcnmlent of 
Israel to respect the human rights of 
the Palestinian people.

for lninorities to expect any spe-
cial exemption from being lam-
pooned like everyone else. Also, 
the paper did not advocate any 
specific form of action against 
minorities. At this point, it seems 
more reasonable to think that the 
UCSD Principles of Community 
should protect The Koala's right to 
make silly insults rather than sti-
fling its right to free expression. 
That the administration has cho-
sen instead to persecute The KoallJ 
does not change this. 

The situation with the Che 
Cafe is a more interesting case. It 
is unreasonable to accuse 
burn.ucsd.tdu of harming people 
in general, since the terrorist 
Web sites that are linked from 
burn.msd.edu would exist regard-
less of whether it links to them or 
not. However, the existence of 
the hastily implemented and 

No doubt the radical leftist 
leanings of the Che Cafe have 
influenced the administration's 
confidence in burn.!tcsd.edu's cl aim 
of imparti al scholarship, but, 
again, the Principles of 
Community hould bo lster the 
legitimacy of the Chc C afe radler 
than stine it. Until and unless the 
Che Cafe starts to advoca te or 
actually perform some ac t of 
aggression against its political 
opponents, we should welcome its 
different viewpoints and alterna-
tive political beliefs. 

Pint: There are no easy answers in N. Ireland 
cunt inued from page 5 

Lis tening to the Irish talk about 
the amazing things C linton did. 
one has to wonder if Bush coul d 
hal'e improved his re putation in 
Europe by helpi ng Belfas t - and 
G reat Bri tain - with this untimely 
scandal. 

In thi s case, though, distancing 
hllllSelf from the issue brought 
ma ny positive responses fro m 
Ulster political parties. Even Sinn 
Fein approved of the decision to 
watch fr0111 afar. 

The reasons the Bush adminis-
Irarion kept its hands off now seem 
dcaI', as the resolution to this con-
fl ict begins to come into view. Had 
dle Unilcd Stares involved itself, 
there would certainly be a tendency 
to help l Im y Bl:Jir and Great Britain, 
given the unconditional support tllat 
England has been !,>iving the Uni ted 
States. Any decision would probably 
have been slanted toward dealing 
harsh pu nishment to Sinn Fein 
p liticians in office, giving Unionists 
an enormous upper hand in the 
Nonhern Ireland govern ment. 
This. of course, would have, in nITn, 
sparked outrage in Sinn Fein and 
mosl likely the IRA. \Vi th the 
Uni ted States at England 's back, 
Republicans in Ireland would have 
had their backs against the wall and 
would have undoubtedly reacted , 
possibly with violence, if the situa-
tion grew more severe. 

By staying away from the issues, 
Bush has allowed the Iri sh to solve 
their problems themselves. The only 
outside influence is Great Britain, 
and unless you're a Unionist, Great 
Britain is already unpopular, so any 
help from Blair \vill be automatically 
regarded with suspicion anyway. 
T his is nothing new in Ireland. 

Furthermore, some of the issues 
at hand are so embedded in the land-
scape that it seems unfair for the 
United States to try to get involved 
when its very hard to understand all 
the issues at work in Belfast. Despite 
the vast number of American tourists 
who have "Irish roots," very few 
Anlericans really understand the di f-
ferenr issues tim cloud Derry, Belfast 
and most of the north. Certainly, 
wid! so much going on in the Middle 
East, it would be a hefty task for the 
Bush administration to nlrn around 
and try to understand everything in 
Northern Ireland as well. 

" Very few Americans 
really understand. the 

different issues that cloud 
Derry, Belfast and. most 

of the north. " 
So then, if Bush's decision to 

refrain is so widely accepted, why 
was Cl inton's help so appreciated? 
Many argue that C linton stepped in 
when there was more viol ence at 
stake and the sense of urgency 
required a quicker outcome than 
political debates cou ld provide. 
Witll the heavy sway of the United 
States, an answer was reached much 
more quickly. \Vith this peace tl13t 
has lasted as long as it has, however 
shalcy, many feel that the danger of 
paraJnilitary groups on both sides 
have slighdy subsided. This issue 
with Sinn Fein may be worked out 
without the urgency that the 
United States would bring with it,

were it to get involved. 
This comparison of the Bush 

and Clinton administrations choic-
es leads to the larger question of 
whether or not the United States 
should get involved in foreign pol-
itics. In [reland , it seems as if the 
answer is yes and no. 

This ambiguous answer is exac-
erbated by the attitude of many 
activists within the United States. 
Many humanitarian groups and 
activists believe it is our responsibil-
ity to get involved in the misdeeds of 
the world and try to fix them. Some 
even lobby in D.C. to get the gov-
ernment involved in countries that 
are clearly not harming or helping 
the Un ited States. At tile exact same 
ti me, however, activists are always 
compbining that tile United States 
needs to leave the rest of the world 
alone. We should not be using our 
power to innuence the outcome of 
political decisions worldwide. 

TIle only answer, tllen, is the 
easy one, unfortunately. There can 
be no universal ethical answer to 
whether or not the United States 
should use its weight in the outcome 
of the world developments. Rather, 
each individual situation will have to 
be weighed on how much we will 
help or hurt the foreign country, 
how much our help and support will 
help or hurt ourselves, and whether 
or not we have any understanding of 
the issues at all. 

Emily finishes with her defense 
of Clinton and [ smile, knowing 
how vain it is to pursue every 
aspect of contention in the Clinton 
administration. For that matter, 
arguably every matter of con-
tention in foreign policy is vain 
without several more pints of 
Guinness to ponder over. 

Profs: Teachers do not 
represent many Americans 

continued from page 5 
Culture verifies the findings of dle 
American Enterprise study. This 
study found that only three per-
cent of Ivy League professors 
called themselves Republ icans. 
The percentage crept up to only 

si,~ percent - slightly better, but 
still disturbingly low - when the 
word "conservative" was used. 

Is the tilt in professorship con-
sistent with the general popula-
ti on? No. A recent Associated 
Press poll showed we're still even-
ly spli t, 40 to 40 (percent), 
between D emocrats and 
Republicans (the rest undecided or 
abstaining) when asked what party 
we will vote for this November. 
Do the 2000 elections ring a bell? 

There's no spin here; odds are 
that the vast majority or possibly 
even all of your teachers will , in 
fact, be liberals. 

Of course, this wouldn 't be a 
problem if you listen to support-
ers of schoolroom bias when they 
try to divert your attention by 
saying, "The individual political 
preference of a teacher is left out-
side the classroom door." But let 
me tell you, that's patently fa lse. 

Who is it, I ask, that picks the 
textbooks you read for class, 
designs the lectures, controls the 
debate and otherwise has the most 
influence on your education? Yes, 

thats right: your professors. And if 
you were to have a healthy balance 
of teachers from acras the politi -
cal spectrum, you could choose 
what beSt defines you politicall y, 
be it the right or the left. Yet in 
colleges today, you might never 
encounter a conservative leacher 
in YOllr four-year stay. 

An eve n more aston ishing 
argument from tile supporters is, 
"So what?" So what! Well , what if 
the tables were nlrnecl' What if 
conservatives held over 90 per-
cent of uni versity professorships? 
Would there be outrage? You bet. 
And I'd be right there challeng-
ing the inconsistency if they tout-
ed diversity in their policies. 

Yet this would be no problem 
at all if diversi ty weren 't pro-
claimed to be the answer to 
everything wrong with society. 
Does everyone not see the laugh-
able irony that as colleges cham-
pion "diversity" as one of the 
main concerns facing society, 
there's no political diversity in 
their own baclcyard? 

Colleges have become their 
own worlds, separate from society. 
And the frightening thing is that, 
as students, we're attending in 
record numbers. I have but one 
question: Where's the fair and bal-
anced education we're all paying 
tens of thousands of dollars for?

Troupe: Weekend appearances cancelled 
continued fro m page I 

Troupe was scheduled to read 
poetry during UCSD's annual Open 
House on Oct. 19. H e did not 
appear at the event, and Open 
H ouse programs were stamped 
"canceled" across the paragraphs 
promoting Troupe's reading, titled 
"Word I Journey Towards 
Excellence." 

The Open House committee was 
notified by Langley on OCt. 16 that 
Troupe would not perform. 

"He's not here because of the 
things you read about in the news-
paper," said Yolanda Leyva, Student 
Organizations and Leadership 
Opportunities director and Open 
House 2002 co-chairperson. "Mr. 

Troupe had the opportunI ty ro per-
fo rm today. We still have a parking 
spot reserved for him." 

Troupe also canceled a sched-
uled reception at the Faculty Club 
on Oct. 17, tided "Quincy and 
Friends." 

Troupe's associates at UCSD 
expressed support for the poet. 

"[Troupe's resignation as poet 
laureate) is unfortunate because 
he's a wonderful person, a great 
artist and a great writer," said 
Diane Wells, an undergraduate 
program assistant in the literature 
department. 

Bill Mohr, a colleague of 
Troupe's, said that Troupe's resig-
nation will not diminish his status 

in the poetry world . 
"Q uincy Troupe IS a superlative 

poet, and I wish tha t he had not 
resigned as poet laureate of 
California." he said. "He remains as 
well-quarfied fo r the post as the day 
he was first nominated. My fellow 
poets in Southern California ... 
agree that our estimate of his 
accomplishment has not altered in 
the least." 

As poet laureate, Troupe was 
to provide a minimum of six poet-
ry readings throughout the state 
during his two-year term. The 
position carried no salary, but 
offered a $10,000 honorarium to 
cover the costs of reading and 
travel.

Although the long-term goal of

executive administrative officer of 
student affairs, also serves to fore-
see any potential challenges that 
the plan might face later. 

Many students feel that Plan 
724 would make services more con-

venient for them. 
"That would be really helpful , 

to have everything in one place. It 
would be too good to believe," said 
Jenni Ko, a Thurgood Marshall 
College junior. "The problem is 
because of how shalcy our network 
is; it might be just moot," said Earl 
Warren College freshman Jeff 
Sing. "If you can't even access the 
site, it's poindess. A lot of times, 
you can't even get on 
StudentLink. " 

Another benefi t of the plan is 
that Student Affairs will be able to 
better serve students without 
increasing staff numbers or chang-
ing the current work schedule. 
Once routine tasks can be complet-
ed online, the staff will have more 
time and energy to devote to 
aspects that actually require human 
interaction and personal attention . 

"I think StudentLink is already 
pretty useful , and any improve-
ments in automation would be 

great," said Adam Qwan, a sopho-
more at Eleanor Roosevelt College. 
"But I think that getting rid of all 
face-to-face communication would 
be a bad idea. It's not good to have 
everything automated." 

Under the new system, students 
would be able to pose questions on 
the site and receive related infor-
mation. Their answers, therefor, 
would not be limited to a specific 
department. 

"These sites would not be based 
on the structure of the department. 
As we evolve, Web pages might dis-
appear so that the page reflects the 
concerns and perceptions of cur-
rent students, potential students 
and even parents. The perspective 
changes from the department to 
the inquirer," Watson said. 

The Office of Student Affairs had 
been developing a Strategic plan for 
improved services since 1998.

Minority grad students increase For sale: used kayaks 
uc enrollment numbers are a 'positive trend' 

By LINDA CHEU 
Contributing Writer 

l lndcrn:presclltcd enrollmen t 
Jt lie i.J\\ Jmll1lcdical schools has 

m~n -;Igndicantly this year, accord-
Ing to :t report frolll the University 
of Cah fornia. U offi cials sa)' the 
lIl.:rca,c IS due to a larger pool of 
JpphClIlts, stronger outreach pro-
grams Jnd mort! funding. 

"\\'e arc grc;ILly encouraged to 
'Cl! thc positive trend in enroll -
ment of underrepresented minori-
tiCS," "lid 1\ lichuel V. Drake, UC 
vice pre,idcnt for health affair~, in 
,In Oct , l) -; tutemem. "These 
r1"'lIlts IIldicate that ollr efforts to 
Increase the attractiveness of ou r 
programs to an ever-widening 
pool of Jpphcanrs are beginning 
to show success." 

Out of the 570 first-year stu -
dents Jt UC medic-a I " hools, 94 
11llnOfltV students enrolled this 
re'lr. T(l1s IS a 4.6 percent growth 
from i.J SI year's 68 stud ents. 

1\ ' for' law schools in the UC 
system, 125 out of 77 2 first-year 
students were minorities . This 
means there is an increase of 5.2 
percent from 90 students in the 
previous year. In add itiun, 420 
morc underrepre emed students 
applied this ye;lr. 

The IIlcreases are significant 
hecause there had heen a continu-

ing decline in enrollment of 
minority students in the UC med-
ical and law school programs dur-
ing the past seven years . 
M.inorities appeared to attend 
prufessional schoo l instead of 
graduate schools, which further 
contributed to the downturn . 
Many IIllll0rity groups faulted the 
passage of Proposition 209 in the 
1996 state election, which effec-
tively banned the usc of affirma-
tive action in any publicly funded 
agencies or programs in the state. 

However, according to UC offi-
cials, it was outreach programs 
geared toward underrepresented 
students that helped encourage stu-
dents to apply for medical and law 
schools. At UCSD alone, there are 
the McNai r Program, the 
California Alliance for Minority 
Participation, the Science Program 
and Howard Hughes Program, 
among others. These organizations 
offer faculty instruction, work-
shops, presentations, academic 
preparation, skill building, counsel-
ing, test preparation and mentor-
ships for undergraduate students 
who plan to attend graduate school. 

Even as graduate scholars, the 
graduate division, conrinue the 
ouu'each to minorities with meet-
ings and interactive activities. 

"I like [the outreach pro-
grams]," said Patricia Davis, a 

first-yea r UCSD graduate stu-
dent. "Everyone is here to help 
you adjust. My experience here 
has definitely been a 10." 

More financial aid has been 
available to students in recent 
years. The federal government 
awards twO federal grants to qual-
ifying first-year minority students. 
There are also fellowships, which 
can give sntdcnts up to $20,000 
each year, depending on which 
department of graduate school the 
student anends. 

Administrators at UCSD feel 
the increased diversity within the 
campus's postgraduate programs 
improves the university's ability to 
serve the state population , 

"[ think [the increase in ethnic 
representation[ is good for the 
campus," sa id Tim Johnston , 
assistant dean of graduate student 
affairs. " [t serves a broader spec-
trum of the st;lte population ." 

Many members of the faculty 
and student body are optimistic 
about the increase in numbers of 
underrepresented students that are 
going on to law and medical school. 

U[ think that more minorities 
attending graduate schools creH teS 
more possihilities, more wi lling-
ness to work hard," said Ernesto 
Mendez, an Earl Warren College 
junior of Latino descent who is 
plnnning to attend law school.

Web page: Services may increase 
graduation, retention rates, says Watson 

cominu£d from page 7 
Al though there is a fixed goal, the 
outlines of Plan 724 are relatively 
broad and flexible. 

"We'll have to learn how to 
consolidate and centralize techni-
cal support," Watson said . 

Both Watson and Wi lli s believe 
that improvements in student ser-

vices will aid education . 
"A bette r set of student services 

will lead to hjgher graduation and 
retention rates," Watson said. 

Beginning sometime this wcek, 
the Office of Student Affairs home-
page will feature a "VCSA

Wal dUrIng the unlversltlty'S annual Open House, held on Oct.19,

Ryu . 

YolJnda Leyva, co-chairperson for 
the event, said Open House was "an 
opportunity to invite continuing stu-
dents, non- students, parents and peo-
ple of the community and showcase 
what UCSD is all about." 

[ndividual colleges also held Family 
Day eve nts, where parents and rela-
til'es of students attended breakfast 
and were encouraged to explore their 
student s' surroundings and college 
life. 

"Families ca n see whcre classes are 
held and what students do outside of 
campus," said Paul Stravinsky, larshall 
collegc program assistant for the dean 

Parents en joyed seeing how their 
new students were settling into college 
life. 

"We're tryi ng to experience campus 
;\S [our daughter] docs and see how she's 
adjusted to her new environment," said 
Susan Clark, mother of a freshman stu-
dent. 

Activities were also available for the 
famili es around the community. 
Located in the walk near Sun God, 
booths exhibited by the Scripps 
Instint tion of Oceanography presented 
fun facts and otller information for kids 
and adults alike. 

"Thcre 3re rea lly nice and fun 
booths," sa id La Jolla resident Patti

In !(jds-Ville, located at Sun God 
Lawn, chi ldren were prov ided a place to 
play games, experience'l haunted house 
and create arts and crafts. Long tables 
filled wi th art supplies were available in 
making mad hatter hats and to decorate 
pumpkin faces . 

Meanwhile, returning alumni were 
also welcomed with arhleric activities 
and other events. Tournaments and 
games were held :H SpOrt faci lities 
throughout campus, while an alumni 
barbecue at RL\IlAC Field offercd a

"People looked like they enjoyed 
Open House," said freshman Kimberl y 
Cisneros. "The food was great and peo-
ple we re really friend ly."

By LAURA MCGANN 
Senior Staff Writer 

You spent four years of high school keep-
ing a part of who you are a secret. You looked 
forward to going away to college, where 
things would be different. In college, people 
would be interested in learning about new 
ideas and meeting different types of people. 
It would be in college that you would be able 
to be yourseif. When you arrived at UCSD, 
however, thjngs were no different than they 
were at home. Being a member of the les-
bian, gay, bisexual , transgender communjty 
was as difficult as it had been before, despite 
your hopes for a change. 

To combat this problem, Alliance, formed 
last year by then A.S. President Jeff Dodge, 
seeks to create a support network of students, 
faculty and stllff who are educated on the 
issues facing the LGBT community. The pro-
gram's steering committee hosts training ses-
sions, usually twice per quarter, to educate 
those interested in becoming allies. The pro· 
gram has currently hosted six training sessions 
and is an AS council sponsored program. 

At the most recent training session on 
Ocr. 14, nine individuals were given a 
chance to catch a glimpse of a world tlley 
might not normally experience, discuss top-
ics relating to the LGBT community, and 
ask a panel of students questions about iden-

tifying as part of the LGBT communi!';' 
The training session began with an intro· 

duction by Nick Mata, the coordinator of 
college and student development at Revelle 
College, who sa id that the training session's 
purpose was to bring "awareness and appre-
ciation of a group of people who are 
oppressed in our society." 

One of the first training exercises had 
participants create a list of terms often asso-
ciated with the LGBT community. A list of 
both positive and negative terms was made, 
with negative terms overwhelming the list. 
The history of the term "faggot," as well as 
" fla,ning," was discussed. 

The derogatory tenn " faggot" comes from 

the old English ternl for "burning sticks. " At 
that time in history, when a bundle of sticks 
was tied together and set on fire, it was 
referred to as a faggot. Hate crimes involving 
tying groups of gay men together and lighting 
them on fire iater took on the term. 

Other terms were also discussed during 
the course of the trainin g, including 
"queer." Tho-ugh it once had a negative con· 
notation, the word has been reclaimed by 
the LGBT communi ty to be an inclusi ve 
umbrella term used by a variety of member, 
of the community. 

Several participants attended the training

"RETURNING THE GIFT: 
CONTRIBUTION TO A POLITICAL 

ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE SOCIAL BOND" 
Comments and questions by 

PROFESSOR HARVEY GOLDMAN 
Department or Sociology, UCSD 

What does giving mean? Is it simply a private gesture of civility or an 
expression of moral generosity? Is it an ' archaic ' form of exchanging 
goods? Drawing from his recent book, U prix dt 10 viriti: U don, I'argent, 
la phllosophie (winner of the Grand Prix de Philosophic de l'Academie 
Fran~aisc and the Prix de Philosophic de l'Academie des Sciences Morales 
et Pol itiques), Professor Marcel Henaff will argue that gift giving is indeed 
the fundamental act of social recognition. It is about trust and dignity. We 
never just give something; we always give OUntllltl through our gift. This 
is why the relation of gift giving is at the core of any political and ethical 
community. Professor Harvey Goldman will offer a critical response and 
engage in a dialogue with Professor Henaff on the main ideas of his book.

College student D.:bbie Evans, aka 
"Pirate Debhie." 

'\'ith a I·ed band.lIla, ~ black eve

furry, multicolored parrot next to

and her fri e nd carried on wi th 
morc pirate jokes, once even com-
ing up with 60 o f them o n a trip to 
England. Her friends starred buy-
ing pirate paraphernalia for her. 
Her father clipped newspaper sto-
ries about real-world pirates. T hen, 
du r ing her freshman year at 
UCSD, he r friend said , "You 
should be a pirate shuttle driver !" 
So she did. 

"I had illustrious plans," Evans 
said. "I was going to have super-
soakers under the seats, attack the 
other shuttles ... " Though she 
never actua lly took it that fa r, 
Evans has sti ll gotten a lot of atten-
tion. Case in point: As students 
board the shuttle, many greet her 
with a friendly "hi ." "Arrrrren't you

driver," he says. "Always!" answers 
a student. 

" It '~ nOt JUSt for my enjoyment," 
Eva ns aid. "At 7:3 0 in thl! morn-
ing, It 's ha rd for everybody. But 
then I [do my pirate thing andl ge t 
some smiles from little kids that 
ride sometimes, too. [t warms my 
he'l rr. My hearrrrrrrt," Evans sa id 
with a laugh. 

But it wasn 't always smooth sa il-
ing for Pirate Debbie. Initially, the 
Shuttle Center did not allow her to 
drive dressed in her pirate garb. 

"[They] fe lt it was unprofes-
sional," Evans said. In protest, she 
changed her banda na to include a 
s ticker that said, "censored." M any 
of her fellow shuttle friends put up 
signs to express their solidarity. 
Fi nall y, the office held a vote, 
resulting in Evans' favor. 

"I fought the law, and I won," 
she said. 

T here was also some controver-
sy about her parrot, which Debbie 
introduces as H enry, or Hank for 
shorr. 

"[The shuttle center] felt it was 

a safety issue, but l wore hlln 0 11 my 
right shoulder," Evans ~ "id . 

~Since IIJnk wa sn 't rea ll v ,I 
th reat to viSibility, he >taved. Since 
then, Debbie ba~n't had ',Iny proh-
lems front the head honch os. In 
fact, she 's been voted " Best \\"'\'t~" 
- an award given by her peer 
shuttle drivers - two years In ,: 
row. 

So what's in Pirate Debbie 's 
future: Will she carry her pira te 
persona on to bigger stages: 

"I don't know, " Eva ns said . "I'd 
hope it would make me a cool 
mom. I don't know how it wou ld 
fit into my ca reer, but jokes ,Ire 
always useful ; everyone has a little 
pirate inside o f them dying to 
come out." 

One joke that resonates with the 
students here is: "What's the leas t 
favorite thing for a UCSD student 
to do'" "Find parrrrrrking. " But 
with Pirate Debbie around, ho pe-
fu lly it'll be a little more fun . 

As the shuttle comes to a sto p, 
the ride rs th a l~k her, and Debbie 
responds, "My pleas lIrrrrre." 

LGBT: Alliance program addresses the gen .. 
der issues of heterosexism and homophobia 

con tin~d from page II 
because they were interested in 
learning about these types of issues 
and how to be more supportive of 
the LGBT community in language 
and action. 

"This community has been a big 
part of my life. A lot of my close 
friends are gay, and I have a sister 
who is a lesbian," sa id Amy, a John 
Muir College senior, "I've always 
been really supportive of the com-
munity, and I wanted to learn how 
to do it better. " 

Another student attended not 
only for his personal interest, but 
for the sake of student orga nization 
Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, 
of which he is a member. 

"There are a lot of misconcep-
tions between both C hristians and 
the LGBT community as far as 
each other," said Revelle College 
junior James Stoner Holk."lnter-
varsity used to have a good rela -
tionship with the LGBT communi -
ty, and [ want to bring that back 
together and really make inter-var-
sity a safe and welcome place for 
th e LGBT community." 

A portion of the training was 
dedicated to a question-and-answe r 
pe riod hosted by a panel of LG BT 

students. The students spoke about 
their lives, including their coming-
ou[ experiences at UCSD. 

"My experience in corning out 
was very liberating for me," one 
panelist said . "Being who I am 
without having to hold back felt 
good." 

Not every panelist had the same 

" My .experience·in coming 
out was very liberating 

'jor me. Being who I am 
without having to hold 

back felt good," 
- Anonymous, 

LGBT alliance panelist 

positive experience, however. 
"I didn't know a lot of people 

who were gay. I didn't know if my 
roommates would want me to 
move out. This is snch a big ca m-
pus, it makes it that much harder," 
said another panelist, 

Some of the issues that mem -
bers of the panel deal with stem 
from heterosexism : the rampant 
belief in today's society that hetero-
sexuality is the superior sexua l ori-
entation. This extends to the 
assumption that all people are het-
erosexual and is the root of many of 
the problems faced by members of 
the LGBT community, including 
homophobia, the fear of homosex-
uality. 

Examples of heterosexism 
include asking a man if he has a 
girlfriend or a woman if she has a 
boyfriend . These types of assump-
tions create an environment that is 
not inclusive to the LGBT com-
munity. 

To help straight parti cipants 
understand what it might be like to 
live in a world of heterosexism and 
homophobia, Mata read a story 
that places a heterosexual person in 
a world of dominant homosexuali-
ty. Participants imagined what it 
might be like to live in a world 
where they felt they had to hide 
their sexua l orientation. Those par-
taking imagined si tting in a cafete-
ria with friends while they discuss a

Erika Hallen-Baino 
are the effects of MDMA 

!(ecstasy) use? 
- Brian, John Muh· College 

Ecstasy increases the release of 
dopamine and serotonin in the 
brain, resulting in damage to brain 
function that cannot be repaired. In 
addition to the brain effects, 
MDMA causes body functions to 
over-work. 

The presence of high levels of 
dopamine in the brain as a result of 
ecstasy use produce symptoms 
associated with heart attacks. 
MDMA users will often experience 
a racing heartbeat and abnormally 
high blood pressure. These symp-
toms are magnified by a rise in 
body temperature from high-ener-
gy dancing and crowded environ-
ments. 

High amounts of serotonin 
severely interfere with the kidney'S 
ability to excrete urine. The ten-
dency of users to drink large 
amounts of water, combined with 
excessive sweating, generates an 
imbalance of the body's elec-
trolytes. The likely consequence is 
kidney failure and/or heart failure . 

Any damage to the brain is due 
to excessive dopamine and sero-
tonin in the brain. Serotonin 
allows the brain to regulate sleep, 
mood and memory. Once released, 
dopamine destroys the serotonin . 
Consistent MDMA users destroy 
the brain's ability to make sero-
tonin, resulting in severe sleep dis-
turbances, panic attacks , depres-
sion and limits to memory fun c-
tion . T hese effects are permanent. 

I hate the yeast infections I get 
when I take some antibiotics; 
how can I avoid getting them? 

- Tallya, Earl Wan"en College 

To avoid the bacterial infection 
associa ted with antibiotics -
Levaquin, Cipro, Z ith romax, 
Tetracycline, and Doxycycline -
additional antifungal therapy 
should be included. 

Two preventative measures that 
can be taken are adding half a cup 
yogun to yOUT dai ly diet, or take 
lactobaci llus tablets (Lactinex). 

It is important to remember 
that if YOll choose to eat yogurt 
daily, you must separate the antibi-
otic dose by one hOllr prior to or 
two hours after dairy intake 
because the calcium interfere with 
the effectiveness of the antibiotic . 

Lactobacillus tablets are avail -
able without a prescription, usual-
ly from a pharmacist, and the re(-
ommended dosage is two tablets. 
two to four times dail y. T hey do 
not interfere with antibiotic effec-
tiveness because they do not con-
tain calcium.

Alliance: Participants feel 
the event was successful 
conrinued from page 12 

heterosexual couple at the next 
table with disgust, even as they 
themselves hide their own hetero-
sexuality. Participants also imag-
ined choosing a major outside their 
field of interest for fear of being 
associated with heterosexuality. 

The exercise touched many of 
the participants, who agreed that it 
raised issues they never had consid-
ered before. 

T he training session IIOt onl y 
opened the eyes of straight partici-
panes - members of the LGBT 
comm unity identified with the 
panelists as well. 

"I am LGBT-identified, so I 
wasn't sure if I'd actually learn any-
thing here or not, but r did," said 
Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more Chris Tipton-King. "I was 
really surprised at how much, even 
as being part of the communi ty, 
there is to learn, especially the 
transgender issues." 

right now because I am questioning 
my gender," said the panelist. She 
said she has grappled with problems 
like being confronted in a woman's 
restroom for not looking like she 
should be there. The LGBT 
Resource Office, in the Old Student 
Center, currently has one gender-
neutral bathroom on campus. 

At the end of the training, par-
ticipants were given contracts they 
could sign if they wanted to be 
active members of the Alliance 
program. Many participants chose 
to sign and handed in the contracts 
right after the session. 

Both organizers and participants 
fe lt the training session went well . 

"I feel [the training] was very 
successful, especially when the par-
ticipants are interacting as much as 
they did tonight - that's what we 
want people to do. We want people 
talking about these issues and get-
ting them out there," Mata said. 

The next training session is 
scheduled for Oct. 23 from 5 p.m. 
to 8 p.m. For more information, 
including the location, e-mail the

Not only were issues of sexual 
orientation addressed at the train-
ing, but issues of gender as well. 
Lisa Tully, a member of the Alliance 
Steering Committee, demonstrated 
the idea of gender with a line 
berween men and women. The 
problem with the groups men and 
women, Tully explained, is that 
lhere are some people who find 
themselves in berween. 

Attractive scholarship and assistantship opportunities are available. 

Some people find themselves 
facing the issue of being transgen-
der, or having a gender that does 
not correspond with his or her bio-
logical sex. A panelist discussed the 
issues she faces with her own gen-
der identity.

X--tretne aerial athletes take to the skies Cross 
country: Boom Boom HuckJam Arena Tour to feature unique mix of sounds and sports 

Postseason 
approaches 

By MARK STICKEL 
Contributing Writer 

The ci rcus is coming to town -
bu t this isn't like any circus you've 
see n beforc. This circus features 
plenty of acrobatics, but notably 
absent are anima ls, unless you 
count skateboa rding icon Tony 
Ilawk. BMX superstars Mat 
I loHman and Dave Mirra, and 
motocross daredevi l Carey Hart as 
something: o ther than human for 
thei r gra~ity-defying feats. Add a 
live band, pyrotechnics and thou-
sa nds of noisy fans to this mix of 
aeria l ports, and you get the 
" Boom Boom HuckJam," a one-of-
a-kind show sure to dazzle youc 
eyes and ears. 

The event, coming to San 
Diego on Oct. 24 as part of its 22- · 
stop tour, will feature BMX, skate-
boarding and motocross stunts per-
formed on a custom-made, million-
dollar ramp system. The objective 
of the three sports in the event is 
the same: to become airborne and 

perfo rm spins, flips, grabs and . 
other stunts in the air. 

Skateboarders will perform on a 
system of ramps, obstacles and rails 
loca ted around the arena floor. 
BMX (short for "bicycle 
motocross") riders will perform 
around the skateboarders. Floating 
on a stage above all this, a band will 
play live music. A light show will 
illuminate the arena, and motocross 
stuntmen will perform around -
and above - everything else. 

In addition to Hawk, Hoffman, 
Mirra and Hart, other athletes air-
ing it out will include II -ti me X 
Games medalist and six-time skate-
board World Cup champion Andy 
Macdonald, Slam City Jam winner 
Bucky Lasek, Brazi lian aeria li st 
Lincoln Veda and pro skaters Brian 
Howard and Sergie Ventura. 

Athletes using the assistance of a 
motor to put them into orbit 
include 2001 Vans Triple Crown 
Series Champion Clifford 
Adoptante; Mike Cinqmars, the 
world record holder for the longest 

jump on natural terrain; X-Ga mer 
Ronnie Faisst; and Dustin Miller, 
the reigning IFMA world cham pi-
on. BMXers Kevin Johnson and 
John Parker also join the mix. 

The show will be hosted by 
BMX star and television personali-
ty Rick Thorne, who will also join 
the madness on stage by riding 
BMX for the "a ll o ut jam" portion 
of the show. Musicians selected for 
the rour vary, and include bands 
such as The Offspring, Face to 
Face, Social Distortion, CKY and 
Good Charlotte. Whipping up the 
musical portion of the Sa n Diego 
show will be '80s new-age band 
Devo. 

Hawk, widely regarded as one of 
the best skateboarders who ever 
lived, came up with the idea for the 
tour as a means to combine the tal-
ents of his fellow athletes and musi-
cians. The name of the tour, 
although bizarre, was also his idea. 
According to Hawk, "Huck" means 
to launch into the air, "Jam" is a 
gathering of talent, and "Boom 

Boom" reflects the musical element 
of the show. 

Boom Boom HuckJ am debuted 
as a one-tim e event at the 
Mandalay Bay Events Center in 
Las Vegas earlier this year. But fol-
lowing its enormous success, Hawk 
decided to take it on tour across the 
co Wl try. 

" Boom Boom HuckJam is an 
idea that is long overdue," Hawk 
said. "It is a skate/BMXlmotor 
show of arena proportions, featur-
ing an elaborate ramp system, 
music and choreography. We, as 
professional riders, couldn't wait 
any longer to make it a reality. T he 
first show was a blast, and it will 
onl y get better." 

San Diego's Boom Boom 
HuckJam comes flying into town at 
the Sports Arena on Oct. 24. 
Tickets are available through 
Ticketmaster and start at $25. This 
circus looks to be like nothing 
you've ever seen before, so if you're 
into aerial sports, be sure not to 
miss this show.

ranked among the top three 
teams in the region . A team 
score among the rap three at 
the CCAA Championships at 
Cal State Bakersfield on Oct. 
26 would ea rn a berth in the 
na tional championshi ps. 

"1 feel very optimistic," Vall 
Arsdale said. "The conference is 
all-important in es tablishing 
your position with other 
Division n teams. It's a step-
ping-stone in preparation for 
the regional , but the goal is 
nationals . The team has worked 
really consistently toward the 
last four meets. I believe we're 
on the threshold of a dream sea-
son." 

Athletes of the Week 

It may indeed be a dream 
season; the team has been 
extremely competitive durin g 
their meets this year, and 
they've had what Van Arsdale 
calls an "ideal calendar year" by 
being able to compete in the 
Triton Classic, conference 
championships and an alulllni 
meet, but he says it is only made 
possible through the solidarity 
of the team. GrlARDl~N

over by 6: 15 p.m ., when the Tritons 
took a commanding 5-0 lead at rhe 
end of the first period on their way 
to d 9-0 lead at the end of the first 
hal f. The final score was 13-4. 

"We took care of business and 
did what we had to do," said sopho-
more ate Cooper, who netted one 
goal in the contes t. 

T he win raised the Tritons' 
record to I 5 -8 on th e season, 
including II wins in their past 13 
games. The Stags entered the game 
2 - lI on the season, having lost 
nine straight, and things didn 't get 
much better fo r them pla ying 
against the No. II -ranked Tritons.

Winding up: Sophomore utility player Clark Peterson rears back to shoot the ball 
aga inst the Claremont goal at Canyonview pool on Oct 18. The Tritons won 13·4. 

"They were our rivals in the 
'80s," said UCS D head coach 
Denny Harper. "Lately, their pro-
gram is trying to rebuild." 

Because UCSD regularly gives 
12 players significant minutes, it 
may have been difficult for UCSD 
to make any difference by empty-
ing its bench . But some players 
who hadn't been seeing much game 
time so far did get a cha nce to play 
against C laremont. 

"A few guys who haven 't been 
traveling with us got some min -
utes," Harper said . "They've 
worked hard in practice and are a 
big part of our team." 

The Tritons seemed to take it a 
little easier on the Stags in the sec-
ond half, during which the two 
teams scored four goals each. 

"We're not the type of program 
that wants to [demoralize) a team 
like Claremont," Harper said. " \Me 
want th e game to still be fun ." 

A day after the shellacki ng of 
C laremont, UCSD played in th e 
alumni game Oct. 19 against sever-
al Triton players from years past. 

"Those guys support us a lot, " 
Cooper said . "It's good to be able 
to give back." 

But even during the homecom-
ing festivities, it was clear that the 
Tritons' focus was already on their 
next opponent, the No.' 6-ranked 
Pepp.:rdine Waves. Earlier this 
month, the Tritons lost to the 

' '''aves 11-8 in a close match. But 
the previous games' experience 
gave the Tritons reason to be o pti-
mistic for their second match with 
Pepperd ine. 

"We played close with them," 
Cooper said , remembering the pre-
vious contest. "They're a team we 
know we ca n play with. If we beat 
them, we'll get more respect." 

Harper is calling for stro ng 
crowd suppOrt against a tough 
Pepperdine squad, which, like the 
No. I -ranked Stanford team they've 
already beaten this year, includes 
from the U .S. nati onal team. 

"I need the whole campus at tllis 
game," Harper said. 

UCSD will host Pepperdine at 
I p.m. on Oct. 27 at Canyonview 
Pool.

attributed the slow start to a lack of teamwork on the 
court. 

"We definitely weren't talking as much as we should 
have been," she said. "Communication was what was 
holding us back in the first game. We picked it up a lit-
tle, but it was still lacking the whole match." 

D espite those issues, sophomore middle blocker 
Katie Hogan had a big night, getting 11 kills and let-
ting her teammates feed off her strong play. 

"1 think we all agreed that we really needed a lot 
energy to pull this match out," she said. "I figured I 
wanted to do my part to help spread energy to every-
one else." 

That energy will be crucial when the momen-
tum-bearing Tritons run up against white hot Cal 
State Los Angeles Oct. 23 at RIMAC Arena, a game 
with heavy CCAA implications . A Triton win will 
pave the way for a Nov. I battle of the titans when 
UCSD travels to Cal State San Bernardino to deter-
mine conference supremacy. Before it gets there, 
UCSD will have to secure more strong perfor-
mances from the entire roster.

Constant substitutions had little impact on the 

lethargic play of tile Lumberjacks. They were daunt-
ed by UCSD at every turn. Inconsistent Humboldt 
State-perpetrated kicks into the crowd almost broad-
sided UCSD fa ns multiple times. 

Spectators at Triton Soccer Stadium were enter-
tained as homecoming festivities continued throughout 
the game. The halftime shoot-alit saw four fans squar-
ing off to successfully hit three targets in the goal. The 
winner received a $4,000 party at the new Eucalyptus 
Point facility and a $1,000 Triton Plus Account. 

The stands were about two-thirds full, but the 
additional attendance from patrons of the neighbor-
ing beer garden was a real asset, boosting attendance 
numbers to 1,021 fans. 

UCSD will host California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South Division foe-Cal State San 
Bernardino in its regular season home finale on Oct. 
26 at 4:30 p.m. at Triton Soccer Stadium. 

The Tritons expect to improve while they finish 
their regular season schedule - as long as they can 
maintain th eir consistency, heart and determination .

UCSD hosts 
first ever 

Alumni SK 
on weekend 

Cross country 
looks toward 

postseason meet 
By KEITH DO 

Staff Writer 

UCSD's men's and women 's 
cross country teams, in their last 
regular season event of the year, 
participated in homecoming festiv-
itie this past weekend by holding 
the UCSD Alumni 5K. 

The race, the first time such a 
meet has been held for cross coun-
try, was considered relatively infor-
mal, with no official results record-
ed. However, according to Triton 
head coach Ted Van Arsdale, results 
were not the pomt of the meet. 

"The purpose was to get our 
alumni more familiar," Van Ar~dale 
said. "A number of our alumni 
guys came back last year to race at 
the Triton Classic, and the gals put 
their focus on raci ng this week. We 
had some of the stars from the 
past, and it meant a lot to our 
department - not only to o ur pro-
gram - that they remain connect-
ed to a program they real1y estab-
lished." 

Va n Arsdale was extremely 
pleased with the overall success of 
the race, Clung the camaraderie 
that the alumni and current run-
ners had with one another. 

"Certatnly we've been able to 
budd a team and a tradition of 
bemg competltive at Division III 
consistently," Van Arsdale said. "At 
DiviSIOn II, now we're mai ntaining 
that position, and with that, the 
lOcoming athletes get a chance to 
ffilngle with some of the best ath-
letes ... and learn from them just by 
who they are and what they've 
done." 

According to Van Arsdale, the 
fie ld was equally spli t between 
alumni and current team members, 
a healthv indicator of the alumni 
relationship with the program. 

"We had half the group [com-
posed] of some of the alumni of the 
past 10 years back," Van Arsdale 
s31d. "I t was really graufying to 
know that individuals are sti ll keep-
ing fitness in mind even when they 
enter the work force." 

Because of scheduling conflicts 
in previous years, which had 
UCSD competing at conference 
championships this time of year, 
the team has never had an alumni 
meet before. However, as result of 
this past weekend's success, the 
team is looking to make it a reality 
whenever the opportunity presents 
itself, including next year. 

"Judging from their comments 
afterwards, everyone had a great 
time - from our current [mem-
bers] to the alumni," Van Arsdale 
said. "Everyone was excited about 
it, enjoyed it and was thankful that 
we initiated it." 

The Tritons now focus entirely 
on beginning their postseason jour-
ney with a strong performance at 
conference championships this 
weekend, which will be used to 
determine whether the team will 
compete at the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Division II 
West Regional. 

Along with Chico State and 
UC Davis, both California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
competitors, the Tritons are

Volleyball sweeps weekend games 
Eighth-ranked Tritons extend winning streak to seven · 

Rachel A. Garcia/Guardian 
Rejected: Sophomore middle blocker Kendra Canape deflects an opponent's hit. 
Canape, who started against CSUB on Oct. 18, had 11 kills in UCSD's victory. 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's volley-
ball team extended its winning 
streak to seven matches over the 
weekend with victories against 
the Cal State Bakersfield 
Roadrunners (3-0) and the Cal 
State Stanislaus Warriors (3-1). 

The eighth-ranked Tritons 
solidified their second place posi-
tion in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, improving 
to 11-2 in conference and 17-3 
overall. 

The victories were highlighted 
by impressive performances by 
some of the Triton role players 
who stepped up to lead the 
team. Against CSUB on Oct. 18, 
sophomore middle blocker 
Kendra Canape got a rare start 
and made good use of it. Feeding 
off Canape's energy and her 11 
kills, UCSD rolled to an easy 30-
19, 30-28, 30-19 victory. 

While Triton head coach 
Duncan McFarland applauded 
Canape's success on the night, he 
noted that she shows promise for 
even better games ahead. 

"I think she 's still a long way 
from reaching her potential, " 
McFarland said. "She's a tremen-
dously talented athlete. She just 
needs a little more time in match-
es to mature a little bit as a play-
er. She's gerting better all the 
time." 

The Roadrunners mounted 
their only serious chall.enge in the 
second game, but their momen-
tum was quelled when McFarland 
went to his bench and brought on 
freshman outside hitter Francesca 
Centofanti. She did her job and 
turned the tide, bringing the 
Tritons six important kills with an 
attacking percentage of .455. 

"Duncan wants me to come 

out and get the team going," 
Centofanti said. "Not only by 
playing well and getting a kill, but 
mostly just getting everyone 
involved and getting people to 
realize that we're a good team and 
that we deserve to win every 
match." 

Canape stressed that she and 
her teammates were convinced of 
the result from the start. 

"We just knew we were going 
to win going in," she said. "We 
had the confidence the whole 
match." 

Such confidence would not 
come as easily against Cal State 
Stanislaus on Oct. 19. The 
Tritons entered the match look-
ing to avenge an early season loss 
they suffered at the hands of the 
Warriors. 

In the first game it appeared 
that the match may have been 
destined for a similar fate, since 
the Warriors dominated and the 
Tritons committed 10 attack 
errors for a 30-24 CSUS victory. 
However, the Tritons rebounded 
in game two with Centofanti once 
again providing a spark off the 
bench. She went on to lead the 
team in kills with 14, despite not 
playing in the first game. 

McFarland also switched set-
ters, bringing in senior Jessica 
Bartter, who dished out 41 assists 
to lead the tcam. With the subs 
and an adj ustment to the 
Warriors ' pace, UCSO elevated 
its play and took the next three 
games (30-24, 30-23, 30-25) and 
the match - a worthy gift to 
McFarland on his birthday. 

The celebration was tempered 
by UCSD dropping the first 
game. While everyone had their 
own theory as to what the prob-
lem may have been, Bartter

Tritons decisively outmaneuver Lumberjacks 
Women's soccer maintains hold on first place with homecoming shutout 
By MICHAEL SCHOECK 

Contributing Writer 

Lively fan suppOrt and fighter 
planes from Miramar Air Force 
Base roaring overhead punctuated 
the cool, crisp au tumn air when 
the UCSD women's soccer team 
decisively beat the Humboldt 
State Lumberjacks 2-0. The Oct. 
19 game saw the Tritons outrun 
and outmaneuver their opponents 
at every turn, even during a slow 
second half. 

The homecoming game, albeit 
nonconference, reflects and rein-
forces UCSD's status as a premier 
women's soccer team. Junior for-
ward Shannon Harrelson con-
curred. 

"The team played hard and 
came out with the right artitude," 
Harrelson said. 

The game also saw exceptional 
individual efforts, including those 
of goal-scorers Harrelson and 
Kristen Conahan, Triton offensive 
catalysts Christine Wensel and 
Megan Mendoza, and the spirited 
defense of Molly Carlson. 

The rout began with 
Harrelson's unassisted corner kick 
goal, which slipped right through 
the Lumberjack goalie's hands. 

Senior midfielder Lauren 
Jacobs contributed to the Triton 
offense as well, helping UCSD 
control the ball . The Tritons 

forced the majority of the game's 
acuon onto Humboldt State 's side 
of the field . 

T he energetic offensive drives 
on the Lumberjack goal, numerous 
penalty kicks by Wensel and direct 
kicks by Triton junior midfielder 
Amy Goker revealed the depth of 
the team's talent. UCSO's 
Christine Kwon and Kristina De 
La Rosa also made strong plays 
with well-executed assists on the 
goals scored by Harrelson and 
Conahan in the game. 

The Lumberjacks looked unor-
ganized in their loss, but UCSD 
lowered its play to the level of its 
opponent during some segments of 
the game. Wensel agreed, saying 
that the team was "more pumped 
up the first half," and because of 
the early lead, the Tritons felt 
secure enough to "layoff." 

Although UCSD's enthusiasm 
slumped a bit in the second half, 
the Tritons still maintained their 
lead, with goalie Jamie 
Lautenschleger taking the reins 
and making strong saves. 

Harrelson, after fantastic 
sidekicks and fancy footwork, 
was kicked hard in the shin, leav-
ing her injured and forcing her 
to come out of the game, but 
UCSD was unfazed by the com-
petition.
