FTC/ Staff Wants Ban on Kiddie Ads 
By Nadine Joseph 

Auoclaled Press WrI&er 
SAN FRANCISCO - Half a 

billion dollars a year now into 
advertising aimed at children 
who gather around the 
television each weekend . to 
watch the antics on their 
favorite cartoons. 

Those c'ommercials have 
come under heavy fire for 
years, but now it is the federal 
government 's arsenal which is 
aimed at the ads. And networks 
and advertisers have collected 
a $500,000 war chest to help 
them in the battle. 

The Federal Trade Commis-
sion begins a round of hearings 
on kiddie ads today, asking for 
testimony to guide their 
decision on whether to regulate 
the commercials. Among the 
recommendations under study 
is an outright ban on TV ads 
directed at children under 8. 

The FTC ' s bureau of 
competition calls "deceptive" 
and "unfair" all advertising 
aimed at children too young to 
realize they are targets of a 
sales pitch. . 

dependent television stations 
and consumer groups are 
among the 80 people scheduled 
to testify over a two-week 
period. 

They will argue about 
medical, psychological, 
jurisdictional and legal issues, 
including whether television 
ads promote sugar consump-
tion and whether the FTC has 
the right to make policy and 
enforce a ban. 

In addition to the ban on all 
ads, the FTC is considering 
several other options 
including: 

- Banning commericals for 
sugared products most likely to 
cause tooth decay to children 
under 12. The staff said these 
youngsters are too young to 
understand the health or 
,nutritional consequences 
involved. 

- Requiring advertisers to 
pay for nutritional and health 
messages to balance their 
commercials. 

Regulating the ads is 
supported by the American 
Dental Association , the 
American Academy of Pedi-
atrics and the Society for 
Nutrition Education. 

vIsIon makes a strong 
impression on children under 8, 
who "can be taken unfair 
advantage of" by sophisticated 
ad writers who bombard them 
with unrealistic images. 

" Advertising to children 
much resembles a tug of war 
between 200-pound men and 60-
pound youngsters," said 
Robert Choate, president of the 
Washington-based Council on 
Children. Media ' & Merchan-

dising. 
Choate favors moderate 

restraints on ads aimed at kids 
- putting separators around 
commercials, adding cost 
figure , nutrition graphics and 
hazardous product symbols 
and increasing the number of 
public service announcements. 

Studies show that the 
average American child was 
exposed to more than 20,000 
television commercials in 1977, 

as a re utt of watching an 
average of 2-3 hours of TV a 
day. To c Qun ter that, 
broadcasters in recent years 
have cut commercial time on 
shows aimed at kids from 16 to 
9.5 minutes an hour. 

Parents' groups argue that 
TV unfairly entices children to 
eat non-nutritional food and 
want expensive toys. Adverti-
sers reply that 5-year-olds don' t 
sho o 

The television networks and 
advertisers, who spend about 
$500 million a year on kiddie 
commercials, are outraged. 
They say the FTC staff is 
behaving like a " national 
nanny" and that a ban would 
trample their right to free 
speech. 

Dentists , psychologists , 
candy manufacturers , in -

"Young kids just don't recog-
nize advertising as per-
suasion," said Donald 
Roberts, an associate professor 
at Stanford University's 
Institute of Communications 
Research.

Some Things That Really Annoy Me 

Editor: 
The article by Katherine 

Hafner on the UCSD Literature 
Department (Guardian, Nov. 
29) contained some good points 
by Professor Lyon on the value 
of a humanistic education. I 
agree also with Prof. Lyon 's 
characterization of the 
Literature faculty as talented, 
diverse and generally open to 
student contact. 

However , I must take 
objection to the assertion - the 
source of which is not 
documented - that "sta ff

incompetence ... ran rampant in 
the department." 

An overgeneralization such 
as this should not be repeated 
without citing its source . But 
even if the source were cited, it 
could not be substantiated. The 
a lleged transgr~ssions of one or 
two can not be used to discredit 
other honest and hardworking 
people. Generally, the staff of 
the department has served 
students, faculty and the public 
with efficiency and thought-
fulness for many years.

had nothing fundamental to 
write about), the lists remain 
as lists, undetailed save for one 
liners that accompany some of 
the more absurd items. All 
ideas, like dirty laundry, need 
cleaning out, though, and wha~ 
follows is a list of some of the 
more nettle some phenomena 
I've have the miserable 
distinction of happening 
across, a list of things that bug 
me. 

1. People who can't use the 
E nglish la nguage: I'm 
speaking of native - born 
Americans, mo tty white , who 
enroll in such University 
programs as visual arts, music, 
philosophy , or a ny other 
abstruse discipline designed to 
muddle your pre-conceived 
notions and render you into a 
cornucopia of incomplete 
sentences . Perhaps you've 
run into them yourself. My 
experience with these folks 
entails having them beginning 
an utterance, vague to begin 
with, about things like 
dialectical materialism, logi-
cal positivism and its relation 
to technocratic politiCS, cosmic 
flows , holistic healing , the 
innate magic of poetry and so 
on, and then letting their 
attempted sentence trail off 
into ellipses, with the rest of the 
intended words falling onto the 
ground like cornflakes spilling 
from a box opened at the 
wrong e nd. These folks will 
tare at you gla sy-eyed, 

looking either near death or on 
drug (perhaps both) and then 
eem to peer into the odious 

depths of their own soul. as 
though eeking a psychic re-
charge from the work orhaving 
to put rive words in a emblance 
of sema ntic order . I find myself 
in these ituations having to fill 
in the words they leet out, trying 

to prod them to get on with the 
business that brought me in 
contact with them in the first 
place, if only to hasten my own 
escape into the land of the real. 
This seems to be a common 
affliction at this school. 
- What makes the affliction 
worse is that most of these 
people seem to take pride in 
their inability to speak, 
revelling in the hubris of being 
in some kind of spiritual 
connection with the universe, 
being in a space so utterly 
sublime that words cannot 
capture it, and that intellectual 
effort cannot comprehend it. A 
lot ofthese functional illiterates 
are smug ill their spaced-out 
dysfunction. I find them very 
aggravating. This is proof that 
too much reliance on the left 
hemisphere of the brain is not 
only dangerous, but downright 
obnoxious. 

2. Redundant professors: 
These poor fellows are those 
who get stuck teaching classes 
on Tuesdays and Thursdays in 
an hour and a half slot. After 
they 've more or less covered 
everything in detail in the space 
of an hour, they find themselves 
stuck with another twenty 
minutes of lecture time. Seeing 
this, they begin to reiterate the 
basic points of that portion of 
the lecture already given, 
points that you've jotted down 
in your notes four or five times 
already . And while the poor 
prof ramble on (maybe he 
feels guilty about letting his 
classes out early) your mind 
tends to wander towards 
thought of how much you'd 
like to be at the beach, how 
much you'd like to go to tt!e 
bathroom (your legs being sore 
from being cro sed over one 
another so tightly) , smoke a 
cigarette and so on. No one, I

Indecision Hits When Majors Chosen 
By John Hondros 

Assocla'e News Edl'or 
H you are presently a very 

confused 000 (undecided) 
major, don 't worry! The 
academic advisors located in 
each college's provost office 
are standing by to aid you in 
selecting a major. 

"Undecided is one of the 
biggest majors here, " 
according to Sally White, one of 
three academic advisors at 
Muir College. "There are about 
500 at Muir," she added. 

Approximately 300 of these 
students are listed as 
undecided and "are not 
really ," said White. "They just 
haven't changed majors." Of 
the 200 students who are~ in the 
true sen e, undecided about 
their major, "about one-half 
come in (for academic 
adviSing) ." 

Muir's Academic Advising 
program relie a lot on the 
Career Planning and Place-
ment Office, said White. The 
undecided student has the 
option of participating in a 
"job-connecting workshop." 

"(The CPP office) attempts . 
to find where a student's skills 
lie and connect these skiUs with 
a job in the future . If a tudent 
ha good math skills, they try to 
line him with a job that will 
require good math skills. The 
major is a compromise 
between the two." 

Academic advising at Muir 
includes interviewing the 
student, discovering where 
his/her interests lie . " We 
discuss courses the student did 
well in," explained White. " I 
try to find out what stimulate 
him . And if that gets us 
nowhere, I usually refer him to 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services." According to White, 
for a minimal charge, the 
student takes a test at 
Counseling Services , which 
rates his / her interest level on a 
variety of subjects. 

" Our main job is to help the 
students help ' themselves ," 
said White . The advi ors 
discuss each major with the 
undecided student, in order to 
find out " if UCSD is the place 
for them to be." 

At Third College, when the 
undecided student walks into 
the Academic Advising Office, 
he/she is asked, " if they are 
leaning toward the sciences or 
the social sciences a nd 
humanities" and appointed to 
the respective advisor , 
explained Joyce Burnett. 

.. Ninety-nine percent of the 
time, the students can respond. 
When they answer , '1 don ' t 
know,' they are assigned to the 
advisor who is available first," 
said Burnett. 

If the student is leaning 
toward the sciences, the 
advisor explains what their 

options are and what would 
have to be done in terms of 
course work , according to 
Burnett. Students are given 
literature about each major 
department and the names of 
the res pective faculty advisors. 

"Before students go over (to 
see the faculty advisor), we tell 
them to read ever the literature 
to get a sense of where their 
interests lie. " 

Third 's advi ing program is 
also tied in with the CPP office. 
" We ask students what they 
want to do when they grow up 
and tell them about the Career 
Planning Office. They have 
field trips, so the students can 
see what a particu lar job is 
like," said Burnett. 

" We try to catch students and 
arm them ' with as much 
information as possible. " 
According to Burnett, Third's 
advisors average 50 students a 
day. " Those who are willing to 
invest their time are taken care 
)f. " 

Before aSSisting students in 
selecting a major, Revelle 
College's academic advi ors 
" try to find out if students want 
to immediately find a job upon 
graduating, or if they are 
planning to go on to a graduate 
or professional school," 
according to Hazel Alksnis, 
assistant provo t at Revelle. 

" If students are going for a 
job market, we encourage them 

to talk to· Career Planning 
immediately . As far as 
graduate and professional 
school-oriented students, we 
direct them toward the catalog 
of the school they would like to 
attend, so they can prepare 
themselves . " 

Alksnis believes it is better 
for undecided students to take 
"some direction, rather than np 
direction - even if it's the 
wrong one." Advisor ancy 
Groves encourages students to 
"try a few classe to see how 
they like it." 

" We try to make students 
aware of what is here, " 
explained Groves. "We lead 
them toward other c hools if a 
class they want isn ' t offered 
here. By trying a class, they 
sometimes decide that' s not 
what they want to do ." 

According to Alksnis , most of 
the undecided students at 
Revelle are " undecided 
science," rather tha n 
" undecided" undecided. We' ll 
help them change to another 
campus if what they want isn 't 
here," she added. 

" We refer students quite a bit 
to the department faculty 
advisors," said Lea Mizumoto, 
academic advisor a t Warren 
College. " There they talk what 
the major is about, a nd what 
preparations need to be done to 

" pur ue it. We don't receive a lot 
of feedback here, because both 
the students a"d faculty are 
tied for time.'" 

Warren offered a seminar for 
its undecided stud.ents 
recently, a nd the turnout W~ ~ 
" better than we expected," 
~aid Mizumoto. " It wa a very 
casua l round-ta ble session. 
Faculty members from most of 
the departments commented 
on the majors and there wa~ 
que tion and an wer period 
after . " 

Warren advisors tress that 
tudents look into course they 

will have to take. "Students 
who want to work with animals I 
and are majoring in Biology 
find out they won' t see too many 
live animal in their classe ," 
siad Mizumoto. 

Undecided students at 
Warren are a lso encouraged to 
take a variety of courses. 
" Students who come in early 
are in a good s ituation at 
Warren (due to the college's 
flexible graduation require-
ments) , because they have the 
potential of witching · the 
major and minors," explained 
Mizumoto. 

Of the approximately 2,000 
students at Warren, 400 are 
undecided , making it the 
largest major at this college.

Science .. 

C.affeine Might Cause Birth Defects 
By Doug Campion 

Science Editor 
Caffeine, a common pre-test 

stimula nt for some, and 
a lcohol , often (though not 
exclusively) ingested afler 
exams, may have first affected 
many people a great deal 
ea rlier than most would 
believe . According to the 
results of several independent 
research tudies, both caffeine 
and alcohol can cause birth 
defects in humans. 

The evidence in the case of 
cafeine comes es entially from 
a study done in Belgium and 
on conduct d at the request of 
the National Coffee Associ-
ation. Though contradicted in 
other report , the concl usions 
of these two investigations 
were enough to spur the Center 
for Scien e in the Public 
lntere t, a consumer group, to 
ca ll for th Food a nd Drug 
Admi ni tration (FDA) to 
require warnings on the labels 
of a ll over-the-counter drugs 
containing caffeine as well as 
on the label of coffee, tea, and 
other food listing the c hemical 
a a n ingredient. 

A report issued by the 
Federa tion of American 
Societie for Biochemistry ha 
advi ed that a lthough caffeine 
concentration in oft drinks has 
not b ee n shown to be 
hazardou , the chemical should 

be removed from the FDA list 
of substances which are 
"generally recognize d as 
safe. " 

The harmful effects of 
alcohol on the human fetus are 
more clearly documented than 
are those of caffeine. For 
instance, a study conducted at 
the University of Washington in 

growth, a small head, defective 
heart, and malformed arm or 
legs.' Not all of the ymptoms 
are physical, however. Fetal 
a lcohol yndrome may b the 
cau e of poor attention pans, 
hyperactivity and nervousnes 
in some children. 

nlike what is believed of 

Alcohol Use Also 
Danger to Mothers 

Seattle examined 12 children of 
alcoholic mothers. Of these 
childre n. all but one were found 
to have been born with some 
sort of a bn ormality. 

The child of a drinking 
mother may exhibit omeofthe 
symptoms of what has been 
labeled the "fetal alco hol 
syndrome." Some of the 
abnorma lities a re : s low 

most scientific studies of drugs, 
though, the results.of the probes 
concerning alcohol show that 
even in relatively small 
amounts, distilled spirits can 

. negatively affect the devel-
opment of an unborn child . The 
National Institute on Alcohol 
and Alcoholism has warned 
pregnant women that even two 
mixed drinks a day can be 
risky. Six drinks or more daily

is definitely dangerous to the 
f tu . 

Still unclear to researchers i 
whether or not the fetu is 
particularly su ceptible to the 
harmful effects of alcohol a t 
one or more p cific period of 
development. 

It is essential for pregnant 
women to be aware that the 
fetus draws directly from its 
mother'S bloodstream. There-
fore . the alco hol concentration 
in the child's blood will be equal 
to that of the mother's. This 
me~ns that , during pregnancy , 
if the mother is drunk, so is the 
child . Yet, whilethemotherhas 
a fully developed liver which 
can metabolize th alcohol at a 
constant rate. the developing 
fetus does not. The alcohol may 
remain with the fetus until the 
concent ratio n in the mother's 
blood decreases noticeably .

The FDA is currentl), 
carrying out its own stUdies of 
the effects of caffeine and

whether la bels should be 
leg ally required to warn 
pregnant women of the 
potential dangers to unborn 
chill~ren .

Hoopsters Whip Pomona-Pitzer, 49-45 
By Karen Hunler 

Sports Editor 
The women 's basketball 

team continued their winning 
ways on Friday night by 
beating Pomona Pitzer, 4!H5. 
The win, the Triton 's econd of 
the season, brought the overa ll 
season record to 2 wins and 2 
losses. 

" It was a very strange 
ga me," commented Triton 
coach, Judy Malone. " It wa 
very slow the whole time. 
Pomona Pitzer played at a very 
deliberate pace a nd we played 
like we were really tired." 

Close Gam 
The game went back a nd 

forth for all four quarter, with 
a 23-22 halftime score in 
UCSD' favor . Pomona was 
forced to foul a UCSD put on a 
full court man-to-man press 
late in the fourth quarter . Lori 

Goldfarb tole the ball , passed 
it to Carol Hawley, who wa 
fouled . Hawley sunk both 
freethrows with 20 seconds left 
in the game to give the Triton 
the win . 

" We put up a lot of shots, but 
we were really cold in our 
hooting,,' Malone remarked. 

Nonetheless Carol Hawley 
pumped in 26, followed by Jill 
Keene 's 11 a nd Lori Goldfarb's 
8, 

The tea m did not do well at 
the freethrow line, inking 3 of 
12 shot . Malone aid that the 
team " improved immensely" 
in the foul department , though. 
In a game played earlier in the 
week the team committed 24 
fouls . 

The game, played la t 
Wedne day night against Cal 
Lutheran, was sweet revenge 
a ll the way for Coach Malone 
and the women'. team, as they

beat Cal Luth ran 62-58 in their 
season's first victory. 

Back in December the two 
teams met on UCSD's court in 
an exciting game, won by Cal 
Lutheran, 44-42 in overtime. 
Last week ' victory seemed to 
avenge that los . 

" The game was great," 
exclaimed Coach Judy Malone. 
" The girls were very 
determined throughout the 
entire four quarter . It was a 
close game the whole way ." 

UCSD led most of the first 
half by 2 or 4 points. During the 
third quarter they stretched out 
their lead to to pOints. Cal 
Lutheran came back, though, 
und went a head by 4 points with 
four minutes to go. It wa back 
,md forth from there but the 
Triton came out on top. 

' 'I' m really happy about the 
way the team kept their cool 
when they got be hind late in the 
game," praised Malone.

High scorer again for the 
Tritons was Ca rol Haw ley with 
26 points. Hawley attributes her 
good shooting a nd high 
individual point total to 
" inspired practices . With some 
more game experience ther'e is 
no rea on why our team s hould 
not keep winning, " Hawley 
remarked . " U 's justa matter of

" The guy get complacent

Even these three giants

Women Ruggers 
F all to State, 
Men 'Lose Also 

By Kevin Elliott 
The UCSD Women's Rugby 

Team lost a bitterly fought 
c onlest to their cross-
town rivals San DiegoState last 
Saturday. San Diego State ' 
(SDSU) Denise "Stoney" Stone 
sco red the winning points for 
the Aztecs when she lumbered 
twenty yards for a four-point 
try . 

UCSD opened the scoring 
before 1.he game was a minute 
old when Cheryl Wright booted 
a twe nty-five yard penalty kick 
giving the Tritons a quick 3-0 
lead. From there it turned into 
a light defensive struggle, 
neither team being able to 
advance the ba ll. UCSD, trying 
to avenge an earlier loss to 
SDSU held the Aztecs scoreles 
until Denise Stone scored 
midway through the second 
half. ' 

Coac h Dave Phillipson , 
though, was not too concerned 
with the loss. The team was 
missing severa l players due to 
injurie suffered in la t weeks' 
an Diego Tourney . It is 

a lso ea rly in the season and 
league play has not yet started. 

Men's Rugby 
In last Sa turday 's afternoon 

match, the Old Goats of UCSD 

took on the Old Boys from New 
Zealand and played well before 
losing 31-4. The score was not 
indicative 'of the way the game 
was played.' The Old Goats kept 
the Old Boy bottled up in their 
half of the field for the fir t 
twenty minutes, At that point 
the much more e parienced 
Old Boys broke loose , Craig 
Flaus opened the coring with a 
try and the Old Boys led 6-0. 
Neither team did much until 
twenty econds were left in the 
first half and the Old Boys 
scored to extend their lead to 9-
O. 

In the second half UCSD 
played well again staving off 
everal charges by the Old 

Boys near the goal line, At the 
twenty minute mark, Mike 
Ratterly started. a n onslaught 
of point for the Old Boys as 
they began to take comma nd. 

The Old Goats finally got on 
the scoreboard when Ed 
Dunca n scored a try. UCSD 
failed to score again but the Old 
Boys scored twice more to 
make the final 31-4. The only 
bad note for the day was when 
Phil Andrews of the Old Boys 
was severely injured and was 
taken to a nearby hospital.

then ," challenges Morgan , In

continued. ;'J didn ' t even have 
to go to the meet - the coach let

still a romp."

And while the Triton 

swimmers a re fatigued after 
their twice daily workouts, 
teams like State are fresh after 
a holiday of only sporadic 
practices. 

"Now we ' re s urprising 
people. The Colorado State 
coach was urprised we had a 
team , and more surprised that 
we had a competitive team ," he 
said . 

SPIRIT NIGHT is coming! It

He Really .Does 
Fly, and so 
Does the' ,Movie 

By Beth Accoma ndo 
taU Writer 

In 1973 producer Ilya Salkind 
had the idea to make a 
modestly budgeted film from 
the Superman comic books. 
Five years and approximately 
$35 million later, amid the most 
expensive publicity campaign 
in the annal of filmmaking, 

u pe r inan has fina Ily arrived, 
and surpri ingly it lives up to 
most of its promolionat 
promises. Super man, despite a 
badly constructed opening, is a 
highly entertaining movie. 

The movie clo ely parallel 
the original storyline of the 
Jerry Siegel" Joe Schuster 
comic books which depicted the 
adventure of Superman. The 
film covers ' Superm a n ' 
infancy on the planet Krypton: 
his adolescence in Smullville, 

but never at him. The multiple 
tylc is not a fault in itself, but 

the poor choice of tyle for the 
early scenes and the disjointed 
u e of orne lyle cau e an 
undesirable inconsistency . . 

The chief offender in the 
marred early scenes i Marlon 
Brando who plays Superman's 
Cather in a pompous and 
ineffectual fashion a nd who 
ca t _ a shadow of boredom 
wherever he goe . The film 
would hav e ben efi ted if" 
Hrando's scenes had never 
been made. and th en the 
producer would hiJve been 
able to save a $3 .7 million 
acting fee. 

Fortunately the majority of 
the film is inventive a nd 
engaging. and the per on mo t 

. de erving of accola de for thi 
succes is newcomer Chri to-
pher Reeve. Reeve. who was at

Superman i a film whose 

brilliant qualities eventually 
triumph over its flaw. 
Fundamentally , Superman 
suffers from a n acute case of 
inconsi tency which mars the 
early portion of the film . Thel 
lack of continuity may be the 
fault of director Richard 
Donner. but I am more prone to 
believe that the numerous 
rewrites before a nd during 
production are rea lly what 's tol 
blame. The script (written byl 
such diverse talents as Mario 
Puzo. and David ewman) 
generally lacks the s implicityl 
that this kind of modern

unevenness develops from the '
