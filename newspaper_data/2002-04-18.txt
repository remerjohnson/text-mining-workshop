Opportunities abound

Warfare industry recruits students 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Space and Naval Warfare 
Systems Center San Diego came to 
UCSD on April 15 looking for stu-
dents who could apply their acade-
mic background to fighting the war 
on terrorism. 

The center's information day 
was aimed primarily at students 

majoring in computer science, 
computer engineering and electri-
cal engineering. It was intended to 
allow students to talk with scientists 
currently working for SPAWAR. 
Students also turned in resumes. 

This is the second information 
session SSC San Diego has held at 
UCSD this year. The first one was

uc nurses rally for 
a new contract 
Possibility of a strike looms if the two 
sides can not reach a quick agreement 

( 

By JOSH CROU SE 
News Editor 

Thousands of UC-employed reg-
istered nurses gathered to support a 
new contract at six university loca-
tions Wednesday afternoon. 

Locally, the' California urses 
Association sponsored a rally at the 
UCS D Medical Center Hillcrest 
where RNs demanded higher pay, 
el imination of "mandatory' on-call 
and overtime work, and immediate 
impl ementation of new RN-to-
patient ratios. 

GeriJenkins, a nurse in the surgi-
cal intensive care unit trauma depart-
ment of the Hillcrest ho pital and 
the labor representative for UCSD 
nurses, said the quality of care 
depends on RNs. 

"We need fundamental changes," 
said Jenkins. "Our ultimate goal is 
always patient care, and we need 
these changes to be able to continue 
to provide this care. II 

Paul Schwartz, human relations 
media director for the University of 
California, echoed Jenkins' goal of 
patient care, but disagreed with her 
methods of achieving it. 

"Our key goals are to provide 
competitive wages and benefits in the 
labor market and to continue to 
reward performance by merit-based 
progressions," he said. 

The CNA has negotiated with 
the University of California si nce 

February. The nurses ' contract 
expires April 30, making:l new con-
tract necessary to avert more seri-
ous actions. 

" \Vhen our contract runs out on 
April 3D, so does our no-strike 
clause," Jenkins said . "The next step 
[in the negotiations] might be to call 
strikes. We are seriOll about our 
issues. Right now [the C A and the 
University of California] are torally 
apart." 

Schwartz said he hopes the situa-
tion will not wme to a strike. 

"[S trikes] don't serve anybody, 
and certainly not the patients," 
Schwartz said. "Strikes are always 
possible, but we view it as a last 
resort. We hope that it will not go 
that route. We'll cross that bridge 
when we get to it." 

The rally featured representa-
tives including U.S. Rep. Susan 
Davis, Assemblywoman Christine 
Kehoe and Assemblyman Howard 
Wayne. 

Chris Reefe, Kehoe's field repre-
sentative, read a letter from Kehoe to 
the ra llying nurses that expressed her 
support for their cause. 

"[Kehoe] is in full support of the 
CNA," Reefe said. "The nurses are 
in dire straits right now to get more 
staffing. We hope that both sides can 
come togethednr a full, fair and just 
contract. "

Attorney proclaims Butcher~ innocence of stabbing charges

Special from The Daily Nexus 

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -
The Santa Barbara County 
Superior Court denied a motion 
Tuesday to allow a UCSD student 
accused of stabbing three women 
with a tranquilizer-filled syringe 
to return to San Diego for his 
studies. 

Judge Edward De Cara said 
that, due to the gravity of the 
crime, 21-year-old Peter Butcher 
must remain in Santa Barbara 
County at least until his May 8 
arraignment.

Butcher's attorney, Richard 
Hirsch , argued that Butcher 
should be allowed to leave the 
county to attend classes because 
the arraignment date poses a bur-
den on his schoolwork. 

Hirsch also said witness testi-
monies place Butcher outside 
Santa Barbara on the dates of two 
of the attacks. 

Among the submitted evidence 
are time-stamped receipts for pur-
chases Butcher claims he made in 
La Jolla on the day of one of the 
attacks.

County sheriff's deparonent last

of turning over a list of 17 wi t-

[that) proves without a shadow of 
a doubt that Peter Butcher was 
not in Santa Barbara when these 
two crimes occllrred, but was 
rather in San Diego, which is 200 
miles away." 

Butcher was arrested for 
assault with a deadly weapon at his

nection witl1 three separate attacks

Muirstock brings local talent, 
fun to UCSD; beer garden nixed 
Convoy, Sugarcult to headline festival in Muir quad 
By RAY HENGST 
Staff Writer 

Convoy and Sugarcuh will per-
form at the free, all-day Muirstock 
festival in the Muir quad Friday. 
The festival will also include mud 
wrestling, a free barbecue and 
"essentially nonstop music for five 
hours," according to Muirstock 
Committee Co-Chair Seth 
KJonsky. 

Reggae band Tribe of Judah, 
John Muir College rock band 
Straight No Chaser, ska band 
Skapegoat and a San Diego rock 
band called Larger Than Life will 
play, said Muirstock Committee 
Co-Chair Gabe Grossman. 

"We tried to get a diverse view 
of the rock world," Grossman 
said. "Between Sugarcult and 
Convoy, there are more people 
who know the acts, so hopefull y 
we'll have a little larger turnout 
[than last yearl." 

About I ,000 people came to 
Muirstock 2001, according to 
Muirstock Committee Co-Chair 
Ruba Batni;i . 

Klonsky hopes this year's atten-
dance increases by at least 100. 

"We're shooting for as many as 
can fit in Muir quad," Batniji said. 

The committee had also 
planned to have a beer garden, but 
Vice Chancellor Joseph Watson 
turned the idea down due to the 
event's close proximity to the Muir 
residence halls. 

"We thought [a beer garden) 
would be another way of sending a 
message to commuter students 
that their participation in student 

events is worthwhile," Klonsky 
said. 

According to Grossman, the 
beer garden had won support from 
Muir college administrators. 
including the dean, assistant dean 
and college provost. Their support, 
Grossman said, was due to the con-
sulcation that the Muirstock 
Committee sought from campus 
police and City Events security 

'We thought [a 
beer garden] would

dents that their par-
ticipation in student 

events is worth-
while.'

company on how to safely nm the 
beer garden. 

"We thought it was going to be 
a safe event," Grossman said. 
"Unfortunately, [Watsonl Jidn't 
feel the same way." 

Watson was unavailable for 
comment. 

"[Muirstockl is going to kick 
off on Sun God lawn, with a mud 
wrestling competition between 
Muir College Council and 
Marshall's . college council," 
Klonsky said. 

The competition will start at 
noon, followed by the free barbe-
cue, an inflatable obstacle course, 
a giant slide and booths placed in 
the Muir quad at 2 p.m. 

Klonsky said free massages 
wOJ.lld be offered around 4 p.m. 
and music would start between 4 
p.m. and 4:30 p.m. 

"It starts off with a reggae band 
called Tribe of Judah," Grossman 
said. 

Tribe of Judah, which has a 30-
minute set, is followed by Straight 
No Chaser, Slcapegoat, and 
Larger than Life, which each have 
45-minute sets. 

Sugarcult, which opens for 
Convoy, is a punk band from 
Southern California. The "Van 
Wilder" soundtrack includes some 
of Sugarcult's songs. The band has 
gotten some air-play in San 
Diego, according to Grossman. 

"The headliner is Convoy, 
which is a band that formed in San 
Diego and got national air-play on 
'The Conan 0' Brian Show'," 
Grossman said. 

Convoy is scheduled to play at 
8:30 p.m. and has a 60-minute set. 

Muirstoek's expenses are closer 
to $15,000 this year, Batniji and 
Grossman said. The largest single 
cost is for talent, with roughly 
$5,000 going to the bands, fol-
lowed by $2,500 for security and 
$2,000 for staging, Grossman 
said. 

Some organizers liken the 
event to a big birthday party. 

"[Muirstock) is a celebration of 
John Muir; his birthday is the 
21 st," Grossman said.

Rally:

The rally identified the main 
points of contention between the 
CNA and the University of

from the crowd of nurses.

ence, whereas the University of

contends that the 
University of

Schwartz contends 
that the issue is 
being exaggerated. 

"Most on-call

The final point of contention is 
the immediate implementation of

patient-to-nurse ratio that passed 
last year. 

The CNA would like these 
numbers to be implemented 
immediately, rather than wait for 
the law to force the change, which

"We don't see the rally as a neg-
ative thing or a positive thing," 
Schwartz said. "It's JUSt one of those

Slates unfairly 
• compromise 

A.S. elections 
Every year, the Guardian editorial board 

invites candidates for A.S. COWlcil J;>Ositions 
to chat for half an hour prior to electlons. On 
the whole, the members of the Action slate 
were not only experienced and competent in 
the respective areas of student government for 
which they were rwming, but also wanted to 
best serve the needs of all students, which 
stood in direct contrast to most members of 
the Students First slate. 

For example, Students First candidate and 
newly elected Commissioner of Academic 
Affairs Halle Beitollahi demonstrated an 
appalling lack of knowledge on relevant sru-
dent issues and an even more appalling apathy 
toward fighting for st,.udent rights. 

Rishi Shah, Srudents First candidate for 
Commissioner of Programming, is also a pro-
gram manager for KSDT and planned to con-
tinue in that position regardless of if he were 
elected, a blatant conflict of interest. This is 
indicative of the larger mentality of the 
Students First slate: Take a representative 
from every powerful student organjzation on 
campus, have every member vote blindlr 
down slate lines and sweep the election. Shah s 
narrow defeat is a silver Iming in the abyss. 

Students who voted blindly along slate lines 
placed incompetence over experience, pan-
handling over real leadership and unity over 
intelUgence. This is cronyism at its worst, 
rivaling city political m3crunes at the turn of 
the century. 

The Guardian, in the strongest of tem1S, 
warns many of the newly electea A.S. officers 
that they must close the gap in competence 
and experience they had behind their oppo-
nents and keep the good of the greatest num-
ber of students, rather than the organizations 
that turned out to elect them, in mind when 
making decisions. Bu there is hope yet for 
next year's government and if they are to ful-
fi ll their mandate to their constituents (and 
hopefully their consciences) they would do 
well to heed this warning. 

The Guardian fmther encourages the highly 
competent but failed candidates of the election 
ro partici pate in student government to the best 
of their abilities. UCSD needs driven, experi-
enced leadership, and there are still an incredi-
ble number of opportunities to help better this 
campus and help its students. Despite the dis-
appointing results of this election, it is the 
Guardian's hope that these driven individuals 
will nonetheless help create a UCSD where 
student participation and widespread knowl-
edge of relevant issues will ensure that a traves-
ty of an election does not occur again. 

In that spirit, the Guardian calls for the 
abolition of slate campaigning on this campus. 
Slates have created a satire of the election 
process; the Price Center, draped in acres of 
posters, conveys no relevant information 
except the names of the candidates. Since 
organizational cronyism has shown itself as a 
more powerful force than any semblance of 
voter mtelligence, the Guardian calls for a 
wholesale restructuring of the system. 

In short, in spite of the difficult results of 
this election, the Guardinn maintains that the 
newly elected officers, with effort, will succeed 
in their jobs. Their opponents still have expe-
rience and leadership desperately needed at 
UCSD, and should participate in any way pos-
sible. Lastly, every candidate should be forced 
to rW1 independently in all future elections.

"THERE'S GOT TO BE A BErrER WAY TO M4KE UP FOR MY AOl STOCK. " 
Kenrick lMlg/Guardion 

U. S. governtnent tnust rethink 
policies on drug war 

Nation wastes valuable resources fighting an 
unrealistic war it may never win 

By JOSEPH UE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Marijuana has been glamorized by 
Hollywood, glorified in music, demo· 
nized by DAR. E., disdained by parents, 
yet heralded as a relaxing pastime by 
thousands - if not millions - of people 
around the world. And let's not forget the 
potential medical benefits of smoking 
marijuana. 

Of course, the "Johnny smokes pot, so 
[ can , too" argument doesn 't justify 
smoking weed. The argument doesn't 
justify the legaliz:ltion or even the 
decriminalization of marijuana. 

We must remember why marijuana is 
considered so dangerous in the first 
place. Some of the effects of marijuana 
include memory loss, lung damage, 
increased risk of heart disease - and 
don 't forget that Mexican-Americans 
who smoke marijuana become violent, 
angry and gain an abnormal amount of 
strength for fending off authorities. 

In the early 1900s, marijuana was 
used primarily by the lower classes in 
the Southwest. In this region, the lower 
class was comprised of migrant workers 
(rom Mexico. Authorities claimed that 
these migrant farm workers were vio-
lent and immoral, and these behaviors 
became associated with the use of mar-
ijuana. The media began to print stories 
about the "dangerous Mexican farm 
worker" and how marijuana made him 
prone to violence. Stories such as these 
resulted in widespread anti-mariju~na 
legislation in nearly every state west of 
the Mississippi River. Don't believe 
me? Read Jerald W. Cloyd's article, 
"People and Problematic Meanings," in 
his book "Drugs and Information 
Control. " 

The notion is obviously ridiculous, 
and Cloyd does not support the legend 
of the violent migrant worker. He 
claims, on the contrary, that myths 
about Mexicans and their marijuana, 
blacks and their cocaine, and the 
Chinese and their opium were part of 
the push toward the criminaliz3uon of 
many drugs. He also argues that drug 
lise among the white upper class was 

portrayed as use for medicinal purpos-
es . 

Whites claimed that they were able to 
control their use, whereas drug use 
among lower-class minorities, who were 
oversexed and prone to violence in soci-
ety's eyes, was purely for immoral plea-
sure. Just look at the people who smoke 
marijuana today. You will probably find 
that they are pretty relaxed, fairly hungry 
and maybe a bit paranoid. 

You would be. hard-pressed to find a 
credible news story about a person who 
became uncontrollably violent while 
under the influence of marijuana -

The drug policy in the 21st 
century is based on 
stereotypes and the 

implementation of scare 
tactics by programs such 

as D.A.R.E. No doubt, there 
are dangers surrounding 

many drugs. But with 'soft 
drugs' - especially 

marijuana - we must 
rethink our drug policy. 

drunken people, on the other hand, are 
more prone to violence. The drug policy 
in the 21st century is based on stereo-
types and the implementation of scare 
tactics by programs such as D.A.R.E. No 
doubt, there are dangers surrounding 
many drugs. But with "soft drugs" -
especially marijuana - we must rethink 
our drug policy. . 

The government is spending billions of 
dollars in the war against the sale or con-
sumption of drugs. Prisons are overcrowd-
ed with nonviolent drug-related offenders. 
The court system is clogged with people 
charged with petty drug offenses. 

Billions of dollars are sent to drug-
supplying countries in the attempt to 
eradicate the transpon and supply of 

drugs when the problem seems to be the 
demand for drugs, not the supply of 
drugs. 

The current British government 
recently softened its drug poli cy. 
Personal use of ecstasy and other 
"dance drugs" will be ignored in ni ght-
clubs. The guidelines set by the gov-
ernment accept that drug use is a pan 
of youth culture that cannot be eratli-
cated . 

The guidelines have also developed 
ways to help those who do decide to use 
drugs at clubs, implementing "chill-
011[" rooms, free water and better venti -
lation. The government acknowledges 
that the use of dangerous drugs cannl 
be stopped, so it is helping people wh o 
decide to take that risk. The punitive 
focus is shifted to dealers and those 
who use "hard" drugs like cocaine and 
heroin . 

The decriminalization and possibl e 
legalization of marijuana has been dis-
cussed within the British Parliament. 
Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes has 
contended that the proseclltion of mari -
juana users is a waste of time. The focus 
should be on help for the addict and 
punishment for the dealer. A pilot pro-
gram in parts of London allows people 
caught with marijuana to be given no 
more than a warning. The result in the 
first six months has been a drop in man-
power hoUTs for the police. 

There have been some encouraging 
reforms in drug policy around the 
United States, but the government 
needs to find a way to rethink the curren t 
drug policy. The focus should step away 
from trying to prosecute users of drugs 
such as marijuana. More focus should be 
on punishment for the dealers. help for 
the addicts and a campaign to truly edu-
cate the public about drugs - D.A.R.E. 
does not work. 

Billions of dollars can be saved, the 
courts and the authorities will have more 
time to devore to more important issues, 
and prisons will be freed up for violent 
criminals. 

We need to rethink our drug ' policy 
and stop wasting time and money on a 
war on drugs that we cannot win. 

THURSDAY, APRIL 18, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Reviving freshman year 
Living on campus again rekindles bitter memories 

I f someone told 
. me three years 

ago that I would live 
on campus my 
junior year I would 
have laughed in 
their face. 

Well, actuallv, I would have 
cried . I was aiways under the 
impression that I would advance as 
I made the transition from fresh· 
man to sophomore, until I evenm-
ally would work myself up to 
becoming a responsible, self-
assured 4.0 CPA senior. Of course, 
life has a way of slapping - or, in 
my case, punching - you in the 
face. I won't say whar four-star, ele-
gam residence I live in now, but I 
will mention that for every UCSD 
snJdent that lives where I live now, 
there are 3.4 million rabbits who 
reside there as well . 

If I trace my misery back to its 
roots, it all comes down to one 
person: my roommate from last 
quarter. Not only was she nice, 
fair and generous but she was also 
the type of person who would do 
your homework for you if you did 
not know how to do it. In short, 
my experience with her spoiled 
me. The next thing I knew, after 
shamelessly exploiting her for her 
excellent cookillg skills, she men-

I 

tioned that she was going abroad . 
Where did this leave me? In rhe 
dumps. Literally. 

It was an awkward time ro look 
for a roommate. All the students I 
knew were content with their living 
simarion and did not want ro help 
me on my escapade for a place to 
live. Not that I blame them. Finding 
a cool place to live in La Jolla is like 
expecting an A in organic chemistry: 
It simply does not happen. Well, at 
least to me, that is. 

After searching online for sever-
al hours and contacting people who 
were certifiably crazy, as in one 
renter's "no-eating-chicken-in.the. 
house" rule to a wannabe "Ace 
Venmra" woman with three dogs, a 
parakeet and a cat, among other 
things, I decided I had come to the 
inevitable: I would be living on my 
friends' couches, patios, or any 
type of furniture that did not 
impale me. 

Of course my parents were not 
too happy with the prospect of 
their friends discovering that I 
was a hobo, so they asked me to 
find out if UCSD would let me 
live on campus. 

However, I discovered rhat 
their concern did not come out of 
a well of parental love, but rather 
out of a cesspool of ulterior 
motives. After several hours of 
torture (J tied them up and forced 
them to listen to me talk for a 
couple of hours) they admitted 
that they wanted me to stay on 
campus so I would be encouraged 
to study morc. (My bad study 
habits have been ingrained in me 
for 20 years, I doubt one quarter 
at UCSD would be the catalyst for 
me turning into an Einstein.) 

But since I am a spoiled brat and 

~ ,. 

they are paying my rent, I obliged. 
And 10 and behold, the university, 
which has screamed bloody murder 
about the lack of housing space for 
returning freshmen, suddenly had 
several rooms available. Just my 
luck. 

While moving my things into 
the apartment surrounded by 3.4 
million rabbits, I couldn't help feel-
ing like this was a twisted case of 
deja vu. Because it turned out I was 
living in the same apartment build-
ing I lived in freshman year. And 
although I was not living in the 
same room (Thank god! Ir had 
always reeked of urine, not mine by 
the way) it was spooky that I was 
going to live in apartment 13 . Was 
this a higher power 's way of pun-
ishing me for having a crush on 
Chancellor Dynes) 

Whatever it was, I had to make 
peace with the fact that I was 20 
years old and not living the life of 
Felicity. Instead, I am living the life 
of myself as a teen·ager. And that is 
definitely not exciting. I mean, I 
have a "mom" (my friendly and 
always chipper R.A.) I always have 
fresh, hot food (although some-
times not edible) available when 
the "kitchen" is open, and I have 
rules. Several rules. Enforced by 
strict "parents" (i.e. the administra-
tion and the RSOs). [n short, I am 
the biggest 20-year-old dork at this 
instimtion. And if you take a look 
around, that is saying a lot. 

There are perks of course. I 
mean the Internet is fast at least. 
Oh yeah, and since I was deprived 
as a child, I think the free cable 
here is pretty nice too. But the cost 
oflosing my dignity and living with 
my "parents" again? Ah .. , that'~ 
priceless.

It goes without question that 

our campus looks markedly dif-
ferent during the A.S. elections 
campaign period . por many can-
didates, campaigning via the use 
of posters, banners and fl yers is an 
important tool. It allows us to get 
our names and messages out to 
potential voters. 

But to average srudents, facul· 
ty, staff, prospective smdents and 
visitor5, the campaign season is a 
time when the campus takes a hia· 
tuS from its normal state and 
begins to take on the look of a col-
orful trash dump. Flyers and bul-
letins cover every inch of open 
concrete along walkways. Banners 
and posters hang loosely and sag 
from awnings, railings, bridges 
and just about every other flat 
vertical surface on campus. When 
the wind blows or the tempera-
mre drops below the dew point, 
campaign materials start to detach 
themselves and either fall to the 
grounrl, fold over or smear to the 
point that they are unreadable. 
Candidates are not winning any

favors among students by annual-
ly trashing the campus during the 
six weeks Irnown as the campaign 
period. 

If smdents were asked to n~me 
the most visible aspect of A.S., the 
most frequent answer would 
probably be the campaign period, 
due to the proliferation of obnox· 
ious posters and banners. Is that 
what the A.S. Council really 
wams? Wouldn.'t council mem-
bers rather be Irnown for the hard 
work they put in during the other 
46 weeks of the year? 

The A.S. Council owes it to its 
constituents to clean lip its ac t. It 
is enough to be bombarded by 
candidates on Library Walk every 
time we pass through; is it really 
necessary for candidates to deface 
the campus and bombard sm dems 
with mass ive amolln ts of visual

I propose that the A. . Council 
amend its election bylaws to cut 
down on the amount of campaign 
material all owed. Th is cha nge 
will save candidates money and

'Genocide has not

Continued from page 6 
entire nation: their own. 

The genocide of the Palestinian 
people we see today in Jenin and 
Ramallah (or rather the genocide 
we don't see - Israel forcefully 
restricts journalists, as well as med-
ical and humanitarian aid from 
entering these areas) and countless 
other Palestinan towns and villages 
is the direct result of this decision. 
Within the past two weeks, under 
the leadershi p of Sharon, the Ia test 
Israeli incursion has killed over 500 
Palestinans, the vast majority of 
them civilians. 

The Palestinian Red Crescent 
Society (a branch of the 
I nterna tional Red Cross) reports 
that truckloads of bodies have been 
taken out of theJenin refugee camp 
by the Israeli Army. Every 
Palestinian who picks up a gun to 
resist this genocide because the 
international community has abon-
doned him, is not only justified in 
doing so, but is a hero. Who 
among us will have the courage to 
stand with him, to assist him in his 
fight and to mourn him ifhe dies in 
his struggle for freedom? 

The very least we can do is 
speak out and educate ourselves 
about the situation and in this rea-
grd I thank Sa ntini for writing his 
article and the Guardian for pub-
lishing it.

-Taha Gaya 
!l1uir senior 

I saw it all : the great theatrical 
passion of the election, all the hos-
tilities, uncertainties and melodra-
mas. I saw the petty quibbles about 
bylaws and the childish flyer wars. I 
spent hours making and hanging 
posters, and I lost sleep over ham-
mering wooden stakes into Sun 
God lawn and patrolling the 
Student Center for the culprits 

who tore down our signs. I did it 
all. 

I started to support the Action 
slate when two of my good friends 
decided to run with Colin Parent. 
As the weeks went by, I found 
myself tagging along to more and 
more slate meetings - who knows 
why. It was fun. It was a rush. It was 
a thrill . 

Let me say here and now that J 
have never seen a finer collection of 
leaders than the Action candidates. 
I'm not speaking merely of leader-
ship, but of integrity, intelligence, 
heart and passion. How many com-
plaints didn't we file? 

How many dirty tactics did we 
think up, but then refuse to use? 
Whatever your opinion of Parent is, 
know tha t I've never seen such 
quiet, easy charisma in such stressful 
times. I can also say that, as a bit 
player in student government for 
two years now, I can vouch for their 
experience, capability and initiative. 

And we lost, too. It hurt. It hurt 
real bad. 

But I am not quite worried -
politically speaking, that is. The 
most important item on that ballot 
- the thing that was politically 
crucial - was the Athletics Fee 
Referendum, and it passed. 
Hallelujah. J can vouch that our 
new A.S. Council is a collection of 
good, capable people. We'll be fine. 
The outcome of the election hurt 
not because it meant that UCSD is 
going to the dogs, but because it 
meant such awful disappointment 
for some wonderful, deserving 
mends. 

So there's a lot of pain floating 
around the A.S. Council now. Sure, 
Students First got all the executive 
»QSi tions, and most of the commis-
sioner positions as well. But the 
senators are split nine to six 
between Students First and Action, 
and that's leaving out Brian Israel, 
who ran and lost on Action but will 
continue to serve as Thurgood 
Marshall College freshman senator 
until fall next year. 

Those numbers also don't 
account for the two interim 
Freshman Senators who will fill the 
SpOts being vacated by Revelle and 
Warren Freshman Senators Achim 

THURSDAY, APRIL 18, 2002 

Lyon and Dina Randazzo. Add to 
that the strong support of certain 
college council chairs (who sit on 
the A.S . Council as nonvoting 
members) and you've got a group 
of fierce politicians split down the 
middle. 

Jenn Brown 's first test as A.S. 
president will be to heal and collect 
a divided, suspicious A.S. Council 
into a cohesive, productive whole. I 
will be very upset if this new coun-
cil does nothing but bicker across 
partisan lines. T will be very upset if 
this new council spends its hours 
fighting over petty resolutions; if it 
ignores the numerous brave 
promises it made during campaign 
season. 

But I'm confident thar the new 
president has the wisdom and polit-
ical courage to pursue projects 
from every slate that ran in the 
election . Athletics. Parking. 
Passing periods. Student rights. 
A.S. services and enterprises. 

My friends on the Action slate 
had a lor of brilliant ideas, and I 
hope - no, I'm confidem - that 
Brown is committed enough to 
UCSD to step across party lines 
and consider these ideas seriously. 

And I'm confident that the 
Action candidates, through the 
same commitment, will still involve 
themselves with student life and see 
their projects through, one way or 
another. 1 would not be surprised jf 
many applied to be an appointed 
assistant to the person who beat 
them in the election; it's not an easy 
thing to swallow one's pride. but 
these people didn't run for prides 
salce. 

The elections were ugly - very 
ugly. I'm glad that half the dirt and 
mucic of campaigning never 
reached the public eye, and I think 
it should stay that way. 

Now is the time for healing, and 
it will be rough. But if there is some 
way to unite the virtues and ideals 
of both slates, if there is some way 
to forget that we even had slates, 
then what will emerge is a strong, 
healthy A.S . Council and a truly 
successful election.

these crimes," Hirsch said. 

Roese also emphasized the goals 
of information day, which included 
showcasing SSC San Diego and to 
"tell people we're hiring." He 
attributed the low turnout fall 
quarter to inadequate advertising. 

SPAWAR's San Diego lab is the 
U.S. Navy's leading labomtory for 
information technology and is 
located in Point Loma, Calif. 
About 3,500 people work there, 
and more than half are scientists 
and engineers. 

SPAWAR mainly researches 
military command and control, 
communications, intelligence, sur-
veillance, reconnaissance, naviga-
tion. and fleet support. A promo-
tional e-mail message stated that 
"with the terrorist attack of Sept. 
I I, 2001, an added urgency has 
been impo ed on SSC San Diego's 
broad range of scientific and tech-
nical activities."

SPAWAR employee Aaron

"Ilnformation day) is definitely

Students attending the event 
also supported such events. 

"It's more personal," said Davy 
Chang, a senior computer science

you actually talk to the people who 
work in the fields, it gives you a

Joanna Sison, an Eleanor

"At the job fair it's usually just

Berkeley 
students sue 
SDSU and 
others 
Two females 
allege that they 
were gang raped 

BERKELEY, Calif. - -Evo 
female UC Berkeley students who 
allege they were gang raped by a 
group of San Diego State 
University rugby players filed suit 
against the university, its team and 
the Berkeley bar where dley met 
their alleged attackers. 

Raleigh 's America n Pub & Grill. 
San Diego State University and its 
rugby team were all named in the 
suit that was fil ed earlier this week 
at Alameda County Superior Court 
in Oakland, Calif. 

The sui t alleges all the defen-
dants behaved negligently, and 
their uehavior resulted in the 
rapes. 

T he suit, which seeks an 
unspecified amount of damages, 
alleges the plaintiffs were gang 
raped April 20, 2001 uy six mem-
bers of the rugby team at the 
Ramada Inn in Berkeley, after 
meeting two other players at 
Raleigh's. 

Berkeley police investigared the 
allegations, but the Alameda 
County District Attorney's office 
declined to pursue the case because 
of insufficient evidence, said 
Berkeley police Sgt. Kay Lantow, 
supervisor of the sex crimes unit. 

The suit claims the twO 
women, both younger than 21 at 
the time, were served alcoholic 
drinks at the bar even though bar 
staffers knew they were underage . 
The plaintiffs became very imoxi-
cated, which played a direct role in 
their rape, according ' to papers 
filed in court. 

At the bar, the plaintiffs met two 
of the rugby players and agreed to 
go to their hotel room, where they 
had sex, the sui t alleges. 

During the sexual ac tivi ties, six 
other rugby team members entered 
the hotel room and engaged in sex-
ual acts with the plaintiffs, the suit 
charges. 

The suit charges the two UC 
Berkeley students did not consent 
to the activities because of their 
intoxication. It also states the two 
women tried to esca pc but were 
restrained . 

The suit claims the rugby 
coaches were aware of the gang 
rape a t the ti me. 

The incident ended after a 
coach walked in and said, "OK, 
ladies, dIe party is over," according 
to the suit, which also all eges team 
coaches knew some players had 
"engaged in prior serious miscon-
duct." 

An employee at Raleigh's said 
the bar has yet to be served the sui t 
and declined to comment on it. She 
said claims are being considered 
unsubstantiated until the bar is 
served. 

The bar's owner could not be 
reached for comment. 

Attorneys with the Associated 
Students of San Diego State 
University, which oversees the col-
lege's sports clubs, are reviewing 
the suit, the association 's 
Executive Director Dan 
Cornthwaite said . 

After the alleged gang rape was 
investigated by the association, the 
rugby team was placed on proba-
tion, and its head coach was fired, 
Cornthwaite said . 

"We've acknowledged there was 
conduct that was contradictory to 
the standards and values we have at 
San Diego State University," he 
said, though he declined to say if 
officials believe any criminal acts 
occurred.

Rising toward a higher tomorrow 
NORML finds little change in marijuana laws 

With hiatus' second annual 
National Organization for the 
Reform of Marijuana Laws inter-
view, we asked NORML how the 
country has changed since George 
W. Bush took office. Suspecting that 
the more conservative president 
would bring a greater inctionary 
tone to the country in regards to 
drug policy, along with appointing 
stauncher officials to public office, I 
once again turned to one of the 
most vocal groups working for the 
reformation of what many see as 
outmoded laws. 

"It's hard to get more conserva-
tive than the Clinton administration 
already was," NORML Affiliate 
Coordinator Kris Krane said. 

As it stands, there were more 
marijuana arrests under Clinton 
than any other administration. 

"Bush has very little to do with 
the everyday arrests of pot smok-
ers," Krane said. "That's really more 
of a local enforcement issue." 

As to whether Bush's presence 
will have a trickle-down effect on 

the country, making enforcement 
and punishment more stringent, it's 
too early to tell . 

At the top level, however, it's 
another story. Bush has brought in 
John Walters as the new Drug Czar, 
and their relationship has gone on a 
rather expected 
route . 

uThe ONDCP 
[Office of National 
Drug Control 
Policy, a organiza-
tion set up during 
Clinton, which 
Walters now heads) 
took out two ads 
during the 
Superbowl this year, 
totaling $30 million, 
which then equated 
drug use with terror-
ism." 

This is a connection that many 
find highly suspect and that Krane 
refers to as "paper thin." 
According to Krane, marijuana -
and most drugs in general -

Story b~ Rinaldo Donnan, 
flssoclate Hiatus Editor 

"come from either within the 
United States, or from Canada, 
Mexico or Jamaica, not terrorist 
countries at aIL" 

Admittedly, the focus of the ter-
rorism-drug link would have to be 
centered on the Afghanistan heroin 

that has been get-
ti ng so much press 
coverage. 

"Eighty percent 
of the world's hero-
in does come from 
Afghanistan," 
Krane said. "But 
only 10 percent of 
America's supply 
can be traced back 
to the Middle East. 
What is really going 
on here is that a 
very unpopular pro-

gram - the war on drugs - which 
people have been increasingly un-
supportive about, has been tagged 
onto a program that people are very 
accepting of." 

The response of the public has 

been less than favorable, and the 
campaign has received a lot of nega-
tive press and criticism as a result. 

A major flaw in this terrorism-
drug argument is that it blames the 
American consumer for terrorism. 
In reality, drug purchasers are inad-
vertently funding suspected terrorist 
groups as much as the average soc-
cer mom IS. 

What Krane calls a "disconnect" 
takes place when you ignore the fact 
that oil and diamonds are more 
readily used as methods to generate 
money for terrorist groups. 

"The soccer mom who drives all 
over town and fills up her giant Ford 
Explorer wouldn't be said to be sup-
porting terrorism," Krane said. 
"And the oil fami lies are known to 
be financiall y sympathetic to ter-
rorist groups." 

Similarly, the internationa l dia-
mond trade has had charges alleging 
that groups are usi ng diamond-rich 
areas as a means to their own ends,

A division of UCSD is based

Medicinal Cannabis Research dub 
It "science." 

"Testing is for long-range 
results," Grant said. "We want to 
find evidence that cannabis works 
as an al ternative to other treat-
ments that are not working." 

Grant is a founding professor of 
CMCR. He understood the neces-
sity for scientific data in the 
cannabis field .

CMCR is hidden among the

C lu ters of buildings create a

director Igor Grant. 

"The actual legislation was 
signed by Davis in the surruner of 
2000, but administrative review is a 
lengthy process," Grant said. "It 
has taken a long time to get our 
project reviewed by the federal 
government." 

The initial studies are just start-
ing at the CMCR. Research on the 
pain and effects of HIV and AlDS, 
chronic and neuropathic pain, nau-
sea associated with cancer treat-
ment, and muscle spasicity caused 
by conditions such as multiple scle-

A place for medicinal marijuana smokers to congregate 

By RINALDO DORMAN 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

For many people who turn 10 
medicinal marijuana, th eir condi-
tions have to be severe enough to 
warrant a doctor to recommend the 
use o( the drug. As of now, a doctor 
ca nnot actually prescribe marijuana 
to a patient; he can only recom-
mend its usc. 

With the passage of the 
COlllpnssionate U e Act of 1996 
- now Ca lforni a I !ealth and 

afcty Code 113 62 .5 - "seriousl y 
ill California ns have the right to 
obtam ,lI1d use marijuana for med-
icin;11 purposes," li sti ng the treat-
ment of "cancer, ano rexia , AJDS, 
chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, 
arthritis, migraine, or any other 

illncs~ for which manjuana pro-
Vides relie f." 

The code also states that both 
i>atieills and their primary care-
givers will be exempt from "crim-
inal prosecution or sa nction" for 
the possession or cultivation of 
marijuana for "the personal med -
ical purposes" of the pdtient. 

What (ollows is that peopl e liv-
ing with terminal diseases, along 

with those sufferi ng from debili-
tating pain, are g iven the option 
of utilizing the plant that many 
claim is a healthy and natural 
alternative to harsh, chemically 
derived prescription drugs. The 
problem is that the typical 
approach to medicinal marij uana 
would leave patients in t heir 
homes, sti ll isolated from the 
community and other people like 
themselves. 

To address this issue is Shelter 
From the Storm's Stir-It-Up 
Cannabis Coffee H ouse with the 
motto, "Bring your own, smoke 
your own medicinal mari juana." 
Started and run by two medicinal 
marijua na users, Steve McWilliams 
and Barbara MacKenzie, the coffee 
house serves a dual purpose. It i> 
both a place for medicinal smokers 
to congregate and an mformation 
resource center. 

I ow housed In an unassuming 
building off Adams Avenue 
marked with a large, painted pot 
leaf on the window, the coffee 
house stands as the victor of the 
battle for the ri ghts to medical 
mari juana. 

McWilliams has been arrested 

three times, and April 20 wi ll mark 
the end of his three-year probation. 
He also acts as the chair for Patient 
Advocacy Efforts on the Medical 
Marijuana Task Force, which works 
in conjunction with the city to 
implement California laws. 

In addition to bei ng a safe 
have n for m edical marijuana 
users, Shelter From the Storm is a 
co ffee house that provides free 
tea, coffee and hot chocolate to 
all. 

There is a main room that 
serves as th e information center 
and waiting area, and a separate 
room in whi ch patients ca n 
smoke. The r ules are s imple: 
Bring your letter, bring your own 
smoke. Providing and sharing is 
not allowed by law. 

In the s m oki ng room, two 
bongs sit amon g copies of "High 
Times" and how- to-grow videos. I 
asked if they were for any patient 
to use." 0," MacKenzie emphat-
ically replied . "It's bring your own 
pipe, too." 

On the horizon is the creation 
of cannabis verification cards,

bles. 
Krane cites " upwards of 

40,000" students have been 
affected by this stronger enforce-
ment: " It used to be that an 
unmarked box (indicating a drug 
conviction] would be generally 
ignored," Krane said . "But now a 
blank box is treated as an admis-
sion of guilt." 

In addition, the federal govern-
ment has also beefed up its attacks 
on cannabis clubs, especially in 
San Francisco. California is one of 
II states to decriminalize posses-
sion of marijuana and is fai,ly 
lenient: It is now only punishable 
by a fine of $1 00 for less then 28 .5 
grams. The Golden State is also 
1 o. I in terms of population and 
marijuana market share, . and is 
second in estimated production 
weight, meaning we've probably 
got more pot smokers per capi ta 
than anywhere else in the United 

States. 
"Most progressi ve movement !> 

start in Cllifornia," Mane said. 
"And marijuana legalization is no 
exccption. ICa lifornia wasl the 
first to legalize marijuana for med -
ical use, and the cannabis c1ub~ 
there arc serving as an e.~amplc for 
o ther tates who want to move III 
similar directions . There is dell· 
nitelv 3n dement of the f"deral 
gove'rnment trying to make an 
example of their ability to control 
this issue." 

Only a fcw weeks ago, the 
Drug Enforcemel1t Agency raided 
a club in San FranCISCo that had 
worked out a deal with loca l 
authorities and was l egall~' f.lcili-
tating the usc of mariJuan a for

Stumbling onto the true 
origins of 420 

The Waldos coined the famous number that has 
become a symbol for marijuana-smoking culture 
By DAVID BYNUM 
Staff Writer 

At San Rafael Hi gh School in 197 I , 12 
high school students did some of the most 
ground breaking work in narcotics linguistics 
in recent history. 

Though rhe facu lty dismissed th em as 
"hippie" clowns who would never amount to 
anythi ng, these few proud individual s pre-
ferred to think of themselves as the Waldos. 
The Waldos were well-known by their peers 
as connoisseurs of cannabis. 

Many thought that for this sole reason the 
group would never do anything to better the 
world they li\'ed in. But the \Valdos took 
what they did seriously tlnd revolutionized 
their culrure by creating a covert stoner code 
that provided a multitude of functions . 

The \Valdos do not get the credi t they 
dcs(!rve for their contributions to stoner cul-
ture. There are numerous false accounts o f 
th e history behind 420 . omc of the mOS l 
popular stones lIlciude .f20 bei ng pollee code 
or Bob Marlev's birthday. The \Valdo, ' 
tlIl0llyt11lty suits' the purpo~e for their fame ' 
namely thJt they were able to get high and 
not get caught. 

By using the words .f20 in conversation, 
the \ Valdos were ahle to relay to each other

said. ·'Califorlll.l and San Francisco are SCI'\'-
ing as the front lines on the medicalmarijua-
Ila IS~UC . Most clected officials, with the 
exception of th e govcrnor. arc very support-
ive of medical marijuana. Politicians have 
started to nouce that mariJuana is no longer 
political suiCide, and they are li stening to tlte 
people." 

Krane returns to the implications of our 
post-Sept. I I nation, as do most things these 
da ys. 

"r\ lot of civil liberties are being chal-
lenged and lost ," he said. "There is a bi g 
spillover from the war on terrorism into the 
war on drugs. II 

that they had a desire to toke up after school 
(at approximately 4:20 p.m). Using this code 
meant this message could be given off in 
front of any unknowing authoritative enemy 
figure . 

Though the code serves little functional 
purpose today because it has gained such 
national notori ety during th e late '70s and 
early '80 (due in part to its proliferation on 
concert posters), the spi ri t of the Waldos 
lives on in the myriad of other codes lIsed by 
small stoner circles today. 

It is hard to imagine what a world void of 
the innovation of the Waldos would be like. 
If stoners were unaware o( their ability to use 
code words in place of the word marijuana, it 
is likely that arrests would increase, leading 
to the need for larger prisons and more tax 
dollars. 

There is no wav of knowinlr how much 
moncv tile Waldos have aved U.S. citizens 
In tax dollar , not to mention members of 
various Other cOllntries that chose to adapt 
the use o f their advanced cncrypuon tcch-
IlIljues. The G,lOrdloll's rough estimate con-
sidering that the techniquc has been in usc 
across the country for nearly 21 years is in 
the $Q20 billion range (adJusted for inn a-
tion). 

Not bad for a bunch of slackers. 

ThiS gives tile government f:lr more room 
to play on people 's Irrational fears and scalc-
up the attack on marlluana smoker~. 

As volati le as all this must secm, there I 
still a slow growth of hope: With California 
as a trend-setter, other states are beginning 
to take notice and move forward. 

"! think we'll see Maryland pass some 
kind of medicinal marijuana Inws very soon ," 
Krane said . "They had legislation tha t was 
one vote shy of moving through their tate 
cong-ress, and that is a lot closer than they 
have ever come in the past." . 

Ivleanwhile, j ORML encoura ges you to 
let your elected officials know how you feel 
about marijuana. After all, the more pressure 
they feci, the more likely they are to do 
something about it.

which MacKenzie said "will make 
the whole process that much easi-
er." 

Instead of Shelter From the 
Stann having to go through the 
process of trying to make sure that 
all the proper requirements have 
been mct - doctor recommenda-
ti on, the person being who they say 
they are, etc. - the potential med-
icinal smoker will be able to go 
through the city and alleviate the 
process. 

"It would really be nice to see 
the city set up a centralized distri-

bution agency," MacKenzie said. 
"Marijuana is an annual crop, mak-
ing personal cultivation rather dif-
ficult for those who actually need 
it. That would make it a lot easier 
for people who need larger doses 
to be able to continue to !11ed-
icate." 

Fo r now, Shel ter From the 
Storm is trying to help set up a nct-
work of caregivers to help patients 
meet their needs. 

"Being a caregiver isn't easy," 
'\hcKenzie said. "A lot of the peo-
ple who could benefit from medical 
marijuana aren 't in the best condi-
tion mentally. If they are trapped 
inside all the time and can't get 
enough medicine, they aren't going 
to be happy people." 

So the task force has to face 
dccisions like how much marijuana

is cnough. 
"It can look like a lot of marijua -

na to an outsider," MacKenzie said. 
'" can use about three joints worth 
a day, which means a little bi t every 
10 to 20 minutes." 

"To suppOrt ourselves, we also 
have a small business," 
McWilliams said. "'vVc sell things 
like cups, stickers and different 
hemp products like T-shi rts, back-
packs and hats. We really like peo-
ple to stop by and see us; we love to 
let people know about who we 
are."

Gomez 
In Our Gun 

Virgin 

*** 
Britpop is dead, having 

made its last, choking gasp 
sometime in the late 1990s. 
When we talk of current 
trends in British rock and 
pop, we have to throw off 
the Britpop corpse and 
look at what has emerged 
in its wake. Gomez is one 
of the grou ps participating 
in tile redefinition of the 
British sound , bringing its 
blues, folk and alternative 
influences together to 
forge a unique creation. 

While established 
Gomez fans will likely not 
be disappointed with "In 
Our Gun," the album i 
unlikely to widen the berth 
of Gomez aficionados in 
the United States. 

One of the hallmarks of 
the Gomez sound is eclec-
ticism. On th ei r prior 
releases, Gomez have been 

wildly experimental with 
the bounda ries of genre 
and with the variety of 
instruments they employ. 
Unfortunately, eclecticism 
can also isolate listeners -
especially when, as in the 
case of this release, the 
recording lacks a central, 
defined sound. 

Past albums exhibited, 
by contrast, a few standout 
tunes that crystallized the 
Gomez sound in distinct 
genres - such as the sleepy, 
acoustic beauty of "lijuana 
Lady" from 1998's "Bring it 
On," and the austere strings 
of "We Haven't Turned 
Around," which appeared in 
the film "American Beauty." 

"In Oltr Gun" contains a 
range of tracks showcasing 
the vocal savvy of Gomez's 
multiple lead si ngers, but 
nothing grabs the ear so 
much as the lush "Miles 
End." The other tracks run 
the gamut from acoustic to 
experimental and LI uesy. 
.. Detroit Swing 66" flirts 
with an c1cctronica bass pat-
tern, and "Ballad of Nice & 
Easy" lives up to its name 
with some thoughtful cello. 

If you' re a self-pro-
claimed hipster looking to 
round ou t your British 
rock collection, " In Our 
Gun" \ ill be a necessary 
addition .

album 

Moth 
Provisions, Fiction 

and Gear 
Virgin 

*** 
T he story of Moth is 

one that many musicians 
hope could be their own. 
This rock quartet hails 
from Cincinnati , Ohio and 
started out playing in the 
garage. They toured across 
the United States in a 
short, yellow school bus 
and eventually ended up 
with a major record deal 
with Virgin Records. 

Moth ca ptures a rock 
sound tllat has been gai n-
ing 111 popularity. The 
movement is a fast-grow-
ing punk/emo scene that 
embodies high-energy 
melodies, crunching gui-
tars, slick pop hooks and 
clean harmonies. 

The Moth sound is not 
anything new but there are 
enough catchy tunes here 
to make the album worth 

• 

reviews 
listening to. 

Their first si ngle, "I 
See Sound," is a cleanly 
produced pop-rock song 
that opens with a melodic 
acoustic guitar riff before 
powering into a two-
chord chorus . The har-
monies of Brad Stenz 
(guitar) and Bob Gayol 
(guitar) are impressive for 
a former garage band. T he 
moment that makes this 
song complete is the 
breakdown in the middle 
with a sort of '80s-like 
syncopation. 

Throughout the album 
you can hear New York 
punk influneces of simple 
chords and simple lyrics 
forming a great song. 
Moth are able to use filters 
on their vocals and elec-
tronics to round out thei r 
sound. 

The influence of pro-
ducer Scan Beavan is quite 
apparent. The producer of 
Marilyn Manson and Nine 
Inch Nails carefully crafted 
compl ex layers for many of 
the tracks. 

T he result is a solid 
album of well-produced, 
but not necessa rily unique 
music. But Moth has 
enough quality to be part 
of the movement that is 
pushing good rock music 
into the front once aga in.

The Promise Ring 
WoodfWater 

Anti/Foreign Lesiure 

*** 
The Promise Ring has 

been character i zed as a 
forerunner m the emo 
scene. Of course, they are 
not sure why tlley've been 
lumped into this move-
ment, bur they are wel -
coming the publicity. 

On their upcoming 
release, "Wood/Water," 
these Midwesterners are 
not exactly emo. Their 
sound - especially in 
songs such as "Suffer 
Never" - captures more 
of a light-hearted pop 
sound: sweeping strin gs, 
bouncey guitars, a jangling 
tam bourine and 
Pavement-like vocals. 

Other songs are more 
somber but 3till maintain 
that pop edge. Songs such 
as "Become One 
Anything One Time" arc 
a perfect example of T he 

HIATU 13 

Promise Ring mellow side 
with soft acoustic gUlfar, 
and the pitter-patter of 
the drums. 

Of course, there is 
some help from Stephen 
Street. They have pro-
duced bands such as The 
Smiths and Blur. The 
effect of Street' work is 
radio-friendly keyboard 
riffs. 

Former Beastie Boys 
producer Mario Caldatojr. 
creates lush sonic sweeps 
and orchestrates an 
anthem-like quality to 
"Say Goodbye Good." [n 
fact, one could say tholt 
"Say Goodbye Good" tries 
to capture the energy of 
the "Nah-nah-nahs" of 
The Beatles' "H ey Jude," 
and it's close, but no cigar. 
But "Say Goodbye Good" 
is sti ll great song. 

Overall, "\VoodIVVatcr" 
is 12 tracks of mellow pop-
tunes that are surrounded 
with lush melodies and 
riffs. Even the greens in the 
tropical jungle-like album 
cover create a lush feelmg. 
The album can c"en be 
considered AmericJ's 
answer to hand; like 

oldplay.

Men's crew competes in San Diego Championships 
Varsity-eight loses to USD, novice-eight wins division

L'CSD men's crew competed in 
its LI,t race of the season. the San 
Diego City Championships. on 
Saturday at Mission Bay. \¥lth the 
women's tea m choosi ng not to 
compete, it was lip to the men to 
represent the Tri tons. 

Tlte morning started with the 
nmice-four race. The Tritons came 
close to San Diego State University, 
but coulJn't overtake the Aztecs. 
fall ing by seven seconds. 

'" was proud of the way they

raced better, but I like the way .this 
group works together." 

T he Illost successful boat for the 
Tritons was tl1e novice-eight boat. 
Aftcr winning the novi ce petite 
diviSion title at last week's San 
Diego Crew classic. the novice 
group nOl only won its division. but 
the second varsity di,rision as well. 
The UCSD jll~ior varsity-eight 
boat finished fourth in the second 
varsity division. 

"Our novice team raced verv 
well," said UCSD coach Mike 
Filippone. "They got the lead and 
didn't let up." 

Unfornmately for the Tritons, 
the same couldn't be said of the 

varsity-eight boat. which finished 
a disappointing second place to 
University of San Diego in its 
race. 

After leading for the first 500 
meters, UCS D seemed to let up and 
gave the Toreros an opening. USD 
quickly grabbed the advantage. 

"We had the lead in the first 
half of the race." Filippone said. 
"USD found a way to get back into 
the· race and we let them. It's not a 
race we should have lost, but it will 
make us better. As a team we had a 
good day." 

However, the Triton coach 
wasn 't happy with the conditions 
on the bay.

that t~ere has been animosity

Yes, there have been labor dis-

this protracted. I have never seen 
so much mud slung and so many

years.

THURSDAY. APRIL lB. 2002 

Musings: 
Aluminum bat is to blame 
for baseball's decline 
Continued from pace 20 

The 1980s was the beginning of 
the aluminum-bat era. Major 
League Baseball averaged over 3,000 
home runs per year for the decade. 
Before this, 3,000 home runs had 
been hit in a year exactly six times, 
and four of these were in the 19705. 

'n the 1990s and into the new 
millenium, the league averaged 
over 4,000 home runs per year, and 
since 1998, has hit over 5,000 home 
runs per year. 

Now, some people say it is the 
juiced ball that accounts for the 
offensive explosion. Has the ball 
been constantly juiced since 1980 
or are players built to hit home 
runs today? The designated hitter 
could account for part of the 
increase in offensive production, 
but what about the shortstops and 
second basemen that now average 
40 home runs a year? 

I thought there was only one 
Ernie Banks. Or the Oakland 
Athletics of today, who preach on-
base percentage and patience at the 
plate, and for Christ's sake, lead off 
Jeremy Giambi. 

How about the faCt that Rickey 
Henderson is still one of the best 
leadoff men in the game? No slight 
to Rickey, 'cause he!; great, but at 43, 
still one of the best, or is it that the 
leadoff position is dying. manufac-
rured runs supplanted by quick ones? 

Still the question looms: What is 
the connection between labor and 
bats> Aluminum bats have initiated 
a whole league of players who can 
hit the long ball. It ha~ given the 
players that bargaining chip they 
need to drive up prices. They are 
now showmen up there to perform 
much of the time and not to play. 

Much of the intricacy of the 
game can be forgotten when there 
are four players on your team capa-
ble of hitting 4O-plus jacks. 
Conversely, owners were able to 
comply. Their profits went up as 
home runs went up. Attendance 
increased from its 30-year average 
of 1 mill ion to its current 
leaguewide averagc of nearly 2.S 
mi lli on. Some teams - the Rockies 
and the Indians, for example - rou-
tinely draw over 3 million spectators 
a year. It is only in the past 10 years

Cross country loses three to graduation 
Peate, Wong, Smith leave memories behind 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Jonathan Wong, Steve Smith and 
Mary Peate have been excell ent ath-
letes and s rudcnts throughout their 
careers at UCS D, working hard to 
maintain good grades and stay in top 
physical form for the Tri ton cross 
coun try teams. During the 2001 sea-
on the wo men 's cross country team 

posted strong results, incl uding a 
victory at a Point Loma Nazarene 
Uni verSIty meet and a sound fifth-
place In the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championshi ps. 

Peate was a great performer for 
the Tritons, placing in the top two 
spots in T r iton fin ishers in many 
meets, including fi rst in the Point 
Loma Nazarene Dual during the 
2000 season , as well as providing 
much leadership for the upcoming 
stars of the c ross country team. 

"Mary P eate helped to mentor 
the undercl assmen on both the 
physical and mental preparation 
necessary to perfo rm at that 
national level," said cross country 
coach Ted Va n Arsdale. 

Wong and Smith have been 
equally consistent on the men's 
side, wi th Wong fi nishing as the 
top Triton performer in the Tri ton 
I nvitational, sixth ove rall. Smith 
fin ished th ird for the Triton; and in 
43rd place overall . As for the 
coaching staff, they could not be 
more proud of how these two ath-
letes conducted themselves both on 
and off the track field.

pI a ye r down wi th 45 seconds left, 
UCSO's de fense shut out the 
'4gers in the overtime period to 
pull off the I 0-9 upset. 

The wi n t\1rn~d out to be 
sweeter tha n usual because the 
same Long Beach team defeated 
the Tritons' \ Vestern Water Polo 
Association rival Loyola 
,'"la rymount University onl y a few 
days earlier. 

Juniors Tucker and Samara 
ilverman both tall ied three goa ls, 

while Hem m erl y fi nish ed the 
game with two goals. 

"We wou ld lose the close games 
earlier in the season," H emmerly 
said. "But n ow we' re winning 

"Both have demonS[rated 
throughout their career what dedi-
cation can produce," Va n Arsdale 
said . "Both came in as average high 
school athletes and have developed 
to become elite in their racing per-
formances." 

Accord ing to Van Arsdale, run -
ning is a great barometer to see 
how fa r a person can push himself. 

" It is a grea t way to develop 
personal character," Van Atsdale 
said. "Distance and training teach-
es patience, and helps to develop 
one's determination to succeed." 

These seniors realize that their 
sport may not be the most fun sport 
to play, but their reasons for working 
hard at it lie in what they make of it. 

"One reason [for racing] is that 
one race - the one race where 
everything goes right," Wong said. 
"You feel great, and you are just fly-
ing. Your teammates are up on their 
feet cheering like mad for you, and 
when i t~ aU over, you JUSt feel awe-
some. It's moments like those that 
make everything - all the hard 
work, all the pain, all the disappoint-
men ts along the way - worthwhile." 

According to Wong, his team-
mates were inte/,'T31 to his experience. 

"The second reason why I've 
enjoyed running is the people I run 
with. If I did not like my teammates 
or coach, I know I would have quit 
by now. The people I have met over 
the years, and the times I have had 
here on this team are irreplaceable. 
And it saddens me that this will be 
the last time I will ever be part of a 
team like this again," Wong said. 

them, and that~ a huge confidence 
boost heading toward the [WWPA 
Conference Tournament]." 

"It was a battle all the way," 
Boyle said. "1 felt our dominating 
defense was the key." 

'This is our time to 
peak and we're doing 

just that.'

With this win, the Tritons added 
another victory against a top- 10 
opponent. They have defeated all 
but two teams this year, with San 
Jose State University and Loyola 
Marymowlt being the sole excep-
tiOIlS.

Their leadership is the blueprint 
for how individual members of a 
team can come together for the 
better good of the squad. 

"We are a team and everyone's 
actions reflect upon our team," 
Wong said. "We're all supportive 
to one another and try to help one 
another out. One of the hardest 
parts of racing is the mental aspect. 
Ted always says, 'The body \vill do 
what the mind tells it.' It is that 
portion of running where others 
have tried to help me visualize and 
get my head in the race. It is there 
that I now try to help the other 
running athletes on our team." 

As you can see, these seniors 
have given themselves not only 
great experiences in college life, 
but also a strong foundation of 
knowledge that they will use for 
whatever careers they pursue. 

However, UCSD may get 
another cracle at LMU since it 
seems likely the team will face 
LMU in the WWPA finals. 

"We really want to face 
[Loyola Marymount]," Hemmerly 
sa id . "Bring it on." 

For now, the team looks for-
ward to its final home game of the 
season Friday at Canyonview Pool 
against San Diego State 
University at 6 p.m. 

After that, the T ritons will 
journey to Santa Cruz for the 
\-VWPA Conference Tournament 
and try to earn a bid to the Final 
Fo ur. Confidence abounds 
among the players as they head 
into the conclusion to the 2002 
season. 

"After [the Long Beach invita-
tional), we Imow we can challenge 
anyone," Boyle said. "This is the 
time to peak and we're doing just 
that."

"Hockey Is a sport for white men. 
Basketball Is a sport for black men. 
Golf Is a sport for white men dressed 
like black pimps:' 

111 iller's 
mUSlll 

B aseball has long been the Sport of America, but recently its grip on the 
youth of the country has waned 
whi le other port like basketball 
and football have gained popularity. 

Baseball is truly in dire straits. 
Labor disputes threaten to wreck the 
delicate balance between the players 
and the owners. Bud "Is that spittle 
on my tace'" Selig and his cronies 
Jrc playing bocce ball with baseball 
tea illS in an effort to create an envi-
ronment where they can get a sabry 
cap to curb escalati ng payrolls. 

T he owners feel that they need 
more assurance of being in the 
black. Mr Spittle, you posted a 
profit last year. T he players feel 
that they should be paid whatever 
the market can bear: $22 5 million 
sound about right, Mr. Rodriguez, 
or how about S18 million per year 
fo r a retired Albert Belle. 

1 Iowever, neither the players nor 
the owners are to blame fur the cur-
rem fighting and the last J 0 or 0 
years of labor disputes. T he winner 
of thi much-acclaimed moniker is 
\ Vorth Spons of Tullahoma, Tenn., 
the first company to mass produce 
the al1ll11l num bat. 

Worth introduced the bat in 
1970. By 1974, aluminum bats 
were lega l all the way up to the 
;\Iational Collegia te Athletic 
Associa tion level and were the 
most commonly used bats at all 
~tages of play, excluding the major 
and minor leagues. ow, where is 
the connection between aluminum 
bats and labor troubles? 

In 1970, baseball was stagnant. 
The heroes of old , like Dimaggio, 
\Nilliams and Mays, were either 
gone or fading away, ghosts o f 
greatness. The league was led by 
youngsters like the Oakland 
Athl eti cs. Atttmdance had 
remained, on the average, at about 
the 1 million mark per club since 
1946, when baseball was the sport 
of a postwar nation. 

Football and basketball , howev-
er, saw increased attendance in the 
sa me amount of time. FoOtball had 
fo rmed two leagues and a national 
championship game. It was finally 
organized. 

Basketba ll flourished under 
Russel and Kareem; Dr. J wa~ com-
ing and the game had a funk to it 
tha t was helped by the American 
Basketball Associa tion and its afro-
dominated roster. 

T he alumi num bat was baseball's 
response to this. T he one thing that 
basketball and football had was 
anion. Constant up-a nd-down 
motion, big plays, big hits and huge 
dunks capntJ'ed the attention better 
than a suicide squeeze with two outs 
in the bortom of the I'linth. 

By introducing the aluminum 
bat, baseball began to breed sluggers. 
Any player who had offensive skills 
was given an extra advantage with 
the new bat. Oinks became doubles, 
grounders got through the hole and 
long fly balls ntrned into home runs. 
Yet pitchers still threw the same ball 
and fiel ders used the same gloves. 
Not only were the bats lighter and 
; tronger, giving hitters an unfair 
advantage, they were also cheaper 
than wood bats. Little leagues and 
college teams un tight budgets start-
ed usinl{ ,he bat just because of this.

Men's tennis goes 3-0 in Bay Area swing 
Tritons jump to 16-3 with wins over UCSC, SSU, UCD 
By STEPHANIE MORIARTY 
Staff Writer 

T his weekend the men's tennis 
squad packed its bags for a Bay 
Area swing, traveling up 1-5 to 
take on UC Santa Cruz, Sonoma 
State University and UC Davis. 

UCSD wasted no time in deal-
ing the Slugs a 7-2 loss Friday, 
UCSC's first loss to the Tritons in 
10 years. 

T he T ritons showed their 
strength when they swept the dou-
bles easi ly and only dropped two 
singles matches to Santa Cruz. 

Mike Meyer, still rusty from an 
ankle injury, struggled in his match 
agai nst Bri an Casey and lost 6-1, 
6-3. Despite this early loss in the 
weekend , Meyer came up big in 
his next two matches. 

T he men faced a less challeng-
ing match Santrday against Sonoma 
State U niversity, which allowed 
coach Eric Steidl mayer to play 
more of his lineup. The Tritons 
showed their depth, winning 9-0. 

Dan Albrecht and Doug 
Hofmann debuted in the No. 2 
doubles Spot and dealt Sonoma 
State a rough 8-2 loss. 

found their way into the singles 
lineup and both were victorious in 
straight sets. Hofmann won, 6-0, 
6-0, at No.5. At No.6, Nagel won 
6-1,6-4. 

Sunday'S match against UC 
Davis tested the Tritons' ability. 

Both the No. 1 and No. 2 dou-
bles teams lost tough m atches . 
Sameer Chopra and Bryan Swart, 
representing UCSD at the No. 1 
doubles spot, lost 9-8 in a nail-bit-
ing tiebreaker to Greg Lee and 
Yaro Vinogradsky. Everett 
Schroeter and Jeff Wilson fell at 
No. 2 to Davis' Greg Ford and 
Paul Dilloway 8-5 . 

T he lone U CSD doubles point 
fo r the day came courtesy of 
Albrecht and Meyer in the o. 3 
spot when they forcefully beat the 
Galang-Proietti duo 8-3. 

With their mood down a bit 
from the doubles losses, the 
Tritons knew they had to muster 
up all their fighting spirit to come 
back and win the match with their 
singles depth. 

Sameer Chopra, at No. 1, had a 
tough match against Greg Lee and 
lost in straight sets, 6-0/6-3 . 

No. 2, sending the Aggies' Yaro 
Vinogradslcy to the bench with a 
straight-set 6-3, 6-3 loss that 
decreased UC Davis' lead to 2-3. 

In the No. 3 spot, Swart, after 
being down two breaks, came back 
and continued the Tritons ' success 
in singles matches with a 6-4, 6-3 
victory over Greg Ford to tie the 
overall score. 

At No.6, Emil Novak recorded 
a 6-3, 6-2 win over Ross Barasch. 

With the two teams neck and 

neck, the No. 4 and No. 5 match-
es were the cliffhangers of the day. 
Jeff Wilson, at No. 4/ dropped the 
first set 6-0 to Aggie Paul 
Dilloway and then came back to 
win the second set in a tight 
tiebreaker, 7-6. With his renewed 
confidence, VVilson pulled out the 
match and prevail ed in the third 
set, 6-2 .

UCSD gets revenge against '4gers for earlier loss 
By JEFF CHUNG 
Staff Writer 

After a difficult weekend in the 
Bay Area, the UCSD women's 
water polo team faced an even 
tougher test last weekend in the 
Long Beach State University 
Invitational. Despite facing some 
of the toughest opponents in the 
nation, the Tritons posted a strong 
third-place finish. 

"We were able to rest mental -
ly and physically during the 
week," said head coach Larry 
Sanders. "That really helped our 
performance this past weekend ." 

The team started the weekend 
off with a match against Cal State 
Northridge. In what looked like a 
mismatch from the beginning, the 
Tritons easily dominated the help-

less Matadors and crushed them 
15-5. UCSD went 4-for-4 during 
man advantages leading to the vic-
tory. 

Junior Dana Tucker led the 
charge with three goals while 
sophomore Meris Bantilan-Smith 
and junior transfer Elizabeth 
Keesey added two goals apiece. 
Keesey also tallied five steals. 

"We fully dominated from the 
beginning," said junior co-cap-
tain Danielle Boyle. "Everything 
was clicking for us." 

The Tritons controlled 
Saturday'S game to beat UC 
Irvine for the fourth time in as 
many meetings this season with 
an 11 -3 victory. Tucker again led 
the team with four goals, with 
Keesey firing in another three.

Eyes open: Team captain Emma Kudritzskl's (*13) Tritons played their 
second-consecutive overtime victory against Long Beach State last weekend. 

Grossmont College, Keesey has 
shone in recent moments with an 
impressive hot streak. 

"She's making the most of her 
opportunities," said Sanders 
about Keesey. "She's improving, 
and that's what we're looking for." 

With two easy wins, the 
Tritons quickly raised the bar of 
competition and faced former 
No. I -ranked Uuniversity of 
Southern California on Sunday. 
With Olympic-quality players on 
their side, the Trojans were sim-
ply too much for UCSD. Even 
with some solid play, UCSD 
couldn't stop the USC jugger-
naut and fell 18-4. 

"We came out and played 
hard, and that's what I'm proud 
of," Sanders said. "This was 
va luable experience for our hopes 
of competing in the Final Four." 

Despite the loss, UCSD got 
what it wanted in the end: a 
rematch with then-fifth ranked 
Long Beach State. Still fuming 
after their stunning triple-over-
time 10-9 loss to the '4gers earlier 
this season, the Tritons vowed to 
take revenge. 

The teams fought to a 4-4 half-
time 'score, but the 'Tritons gained 
the first advantage as they held an 
8-6 lead in the fourth period. 

Long Beach tied the game at 9-
9 and the two teams headed into 
their second straight overtime 
contest. 

Senior Courtney Hemmerly 
scored UCSD's go-ahead goal 
with about two minutes left in 
the period. Despite being one
