knew as 23-year-old Ron 

McK~lvey was revealed last 
week to be actually Ron 
Weaver, a 30-year-old playing 
in his seventh season of cOllege 
football. Weaver played at 
several junior colleges before 
attending lIT. "Playing football 
is a reason not to grow up," 
Weaver told Sports Illustrated

now under investigation by the 
FBI and could be charged with 
wire fraud, mail fraud and 
breach of social-security laws.

campus police. Though he has

an open letter to Gregorian 
complained the university was 
call)'ing on its deliberations 
"behind closed doors," and 
pointed to recent police-
harassment cases as reasons to 
deny officers weapons. 
Gregorian called these refer-
ences "overheated rhetoric" and 
said both students and faculty 
were involved in the decision-
making process. In a non-
binding vote, 77 percent of 
voting students were against 
arming campus police officers.

Medical School Awarded $2.6 Million

According to Dr. George Palade, 
a Nobel laureate and the dean for

of Medicine, immunology and hu-
man genetics were singled out for 
funding because they are areas that 
are not sufficiently represented at

In the UC system, UCLA and UCSF 
also received money. 

Proposals from the 117 medical 
schools which applied forthegrants 
were evaluated by an external re-
view board composed of biomedi-
cal scientists.

The UCSD School of Medicine 
has been selected as a recipient of a 
$2.6 million grant from the Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute. 

The grant, which will be divided 
and dispersed equally over the next 
four years, will be used to recruit 
immunology and human-genetics 

"This support gives UCSD the 
opportunity to develop strength in

Palade said the school will use 
the fund to enhance two existing 
immunology positions and one hu-
man-genetics position. The institute 
has already earmarked a portion of 
the money for general equipment 
purchasing, as well as more costly 
items such as cell sorters and auto-
mated DNA sequencers. 

UCSD was among 30 public and 
private nationwide uni versities cho-
sen to share the $80 million in grants. 

Palade said UCSD was success-
ful in its bid becau e it will use the 
grant to enhance the education of 
the medical students. 

'The medical students and gradu-
ate students are going to see the 
effects of thi grant," he said.

UCSD Rallies Around Education at 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Parade 
UNITE: All five colleges team 
up in sending 200 students to 
downtown event 
By Mary Hlglns 
Staff Writer 

A delegation of approximately 100 UCSD staff 
members and students cheered and marched 
through the streets of downtown San Diego Satur-
day morning as part of the city's 16th-annual 
Martin Luther King, Jr. parade. 

The UCSD marchers walked with several com-
munity groups, religious oraanizations, business 
leaders and politicians. Bands and dancing groups 
also performed on the day which marks the famed 
civil-ri,hu advocate's birthday. -

UCSD was one of several local colleges, in-
chldin, San Die,o State University and Mesa

• 

Houston, coordinator of student activities at 
UCSD's Marshall College, said that participating 
in the parade was a way to stress the importance of 
education. 'This is one of the few opportunities to 
bring colleges together," she said. 

Students and facuIty carried banners and passed 
out UCSD-emblazoned pencils, balloons, rulers 
and daily planners to the crowd. Observers lined 
both sides of the streets, as the UCSD group 
chanted slogans emphasizing education as a means 
of battling prejudice and oppression. 

"It is a chance for UCSD to be active in the San 
Diego community," Marshall junior Coleen 
Sabatini said. "So much of what we do is isolated. 
It's important for us to show that UCSD students 
care about race relations and education." -

Statues 
Missing From 
Aquarium 
THEn?: Pieces were given to 
Stephen Birch by former SIO 
Director Nierenberg 
By Anand Patel 
Staff Writer 

Stephen Birch Aquanum Book hop staff 
members rep rted Tues., Jan. 9, the theft of 
seven hand-carved, ivory figurines estimated 
10 be worth $8,000. 

The co llection of statues - which was 
donated by former Director of Scripps In ti -
tution of Oceanography Wi ll iam A. 
Nierenberg - is thought to have been stolen 
sometime between the ummerof 1994 and 
November 1995. 

According to Bookshop Managing Di-
rector Ruth Shelly, the time period in which 
the theft could have occurred is so long 
because the aquarium performs an inventory 
only twice per year. 

During last November's inventory check, 
staff members discovered the ivory figu-
rines were missing from the back room where 
the statues were normally stored. 

Shelly, who had never seen the figu-
rines, said the bookshop was storing them 
in the back room until they could be dis-
played. She said the va lue of the figurines 
reported to the police was estimated by the 
donor, and that it may not renect their 
actual worth. 

Although the statues were reported as 
stolen, Shelly said they should be consid-
ered 'just missing." 

"We do not know if [the figurines] were 
packed away, taken or misplaced. We do not 
want to jump to any conclusions," she said. 

Shelly added that the figurines were re-
ported as stolen to police because that is 
"routine procedure" when items of such value 
are found missing. 

According to Shelly, the police depart-
ment informed her that it would search its 
own records to see if the items in question 
had been found. In the meantime, police told 
Shelly to look over her records again. 

Sergeant Bob Jones of the UCSD Police 
Department said the police have not found 
any clues or evidence in the case. 

The long time period over which the theft 
could have occurred makes the investigation 
very difficult, Jones said.

their scientific contributions, joumal articles and 
honors . 

Hedrick is best known for his 1984 research in 
which he cloned the gene which encodes the T~ell 
antigen receptor, a key component of the immune 
system. His research revealed the manner in which 
the receptor recognizes foreign invaders and 
influences immune-system defenses.

GRANT: 
$2.1 million given 
Continued from ,... 1 

The Howard Hughes Medi-
cal Institute, a medical research 
organization, has awarded $548 
million in grants since 1988 to 
enhance science education. In 
addition to being the nation's 
largest private philanthropic or-
ganization, it also conducls bio-
medical research with 280 of its 
own scientists at 62 universities. 

Though UCSD is a public 
school, private funding is becom-
ing increasingly important as the 
continuing budgel crisis makes 
federal and state support less than 
reliable. 

"Though [private funding) 
is relatively small compared 10 
that from the federal govern-
ment, right now wedonot know 
how the [federal] supporl will 
develop," Palade said. 

" It may shrink: there may be 
a delay; it is very uncertain . 
The presenl crisis for funding 
of general rese~rch has been 
allevialed by these grants from 
the privale sector," she added. 

Some studenls speculated that 
UCSO's participation might have 
been larger if the three-day week-
end had not provided an opportu-
nity for many to leave lown. But 
because a fairly large number of 
students from a cross-section of 
the school attended the parade. 
most expressed satisfaction with 
the outcome. 

"I'm excited to have an oppor-
tunity to celebrate the birthday of 
Martin Luther King. Jr. with such 
a diverse group of people," said 
Jason Sarouhan, a firsl-year stu-
dent at Marshall who had never 
attended the parade before.

PINION 

1993 display at the University 
Bookstore boldly asked: "Who 
says there are no good female MI-

thors'~" While the simple answer 
is "No one." the boobtore and the 
university as a whoIc would like 
students to believe thai there is a 
significant misogynist movement 
in America working to strip any 
female Mlthor of her due recogni-
tion. The creation of a straw man 
to strengthen one's own agenda 

epitomizes the current state of university cdu-
calion in California and beyond. 

Inside today's classroom, the agenda is to 
fully implement a revisionist version of history, 
minimizing any historical achievements by "0p-
pressive" Europeans - all which is done to 
question the Well's ultimate worth in leading 
the world to "democracy and genuine freedom." 
We are taught !hal the true heroes of history have 
been ~ weak, the conquered and the "op-

and J.P. MOIJIII. And the slaves were actually 

"active 1FI'Its," the ones who initiated the Civil 
War by forcing the issue into the national c0n-
sciousness. 

While theories such as these should be c0n-
sidered and studied, they should not be fon:cd 
upon students. The true danger of modem edu-
cation is not the considenIion of these a1terna-
tive views, but raIher the horrifying IIIempt by 
universities to hide behind a guise of objectiv-
ity. If professors were illlereSlCd in encouras-
ing their students to ponder all potcntiaI sides 
of an issue - which they should do - they 
would acknowledge that their courses and read-
ings are biased. Instructors would tell students 
that they have selcctcd a path of study empha-
sizing a particular focus. reminding students to 
consider what other historians and professors 
believe. 

The easiest way to accomplish this form of 
ieaching would be to provide reading selcc- .

ions. raIher than inundating students with 
the same viewpoints in an effort to achieve

One of ·the oonsequences of ttUs 
approach is that universities feel c0m-
pelled to expose all students to these 
alternative studies through general 
educalion requirerncnts. And lectur-
ers, unable to ignore the ideas they 
have come upon in alternative texts, 
often employ them in courses in 
which they seemingly do not belong. 

Today, in a literature course en-
titled the American Renaissance, not 
only will you study the "Big Five"

types in the media. ~ choosing this 
second reading, the fessor tries to 
show his students he is not biased 
against alternative viewpoints. 

However, both arguments stem 
from the same premise: The media 
creates negative stereotypes of 
women, a debatable issue in the first 
place. Unfortunately, students who 
have not studied the issue, or don't 
analyze the media and its motives, 
might never question the original 
premise. Therefore, the professor has 
succeeded not only in cementing a 
questionable theory in the minds of 
his students, but he has also passed it 
off as an objective approach. 

Often, professors create a non-ex-
istent opposition to justify their re-
search or opinions, just as the book-
store display did . In most history 
classes at the university level, the 
course books begin with an introduc-
tion of this nature: "While most 
Americans have grown up studying 
rosy pictures of American success and 
believing that American history has 
been beneficial to all, in fact it has

est feminists, or William Apess, the 
American Indian pastor who ques-
tioned who could be Christian. A 
fair question. after taking such a 
course. would be, "Why were five 
men who never left New England 
considered the progenitors of the 
American Renaissance for nearly 
100 years? What about all these 
other writers?" 

If this course's curriculum con-
tained only the "Big Five," students 
would never be able to ask such 
questions. Furthermore, it is next to 
impossible to ignore the implica· 
tions of such questions after read-
ing the alternative texts. Thankfully, 
those who cannot ignore such impli· 
cations have produced a new canon 
based on innovative ideas, rather than 
those recycled century after century. 

However, in the eyes of 
ethnocentrists, forcing college stu· 

treaded on far more people than it has 
lifted up to success. The American 
dream has been uncovered as just that: 
a dream." By using such a statement, 
the course encourages students to 
more fully embrace the seemingly 
new views of history. 

In reality, though, most Americans 
don' t see every aspect of their history 
as rosy; they recognize the hardships 
that some non-whites suffered during 
the 19505, and they know that our 
founding fathers were slaveholders 
and 5O-0n. But when the college stu-
dent is told that Americans have been 
unsympathetic to such oppressed par-
ties, the sympathy within them grows, 
as does the desire to latch on to even 
more extreme views of similar issues. 

It is equally m.isleading to claim 
that "traditional history" is false, thus 
justifying the current leftist till. While 
our parents and grandparents may 
have studied only the traditional ver-
sion, our generation has received 
nothing but revisionist, biased and 
misleading history. With every 
teacher and professor from high 
school through college pushing simi-
lar agendas, revisionist history is all 
we have ever received.

is equivalent to reverse racism. It's 
amazing to watch their faces twist 
as they describe their latest griev-
ances about one teacher or another, 
saying things like, "Today, I f~und

agenda. 

This process goes along with an-
other more popular one: discrediting 
the opposition. By briefly consider-
ing the "traditional" analysis and 
painting it in an untlattering and un-
acceptable light, the professor can 
more easily dismiss it an(f attract stu-
dents to his own agenda. 

Students, however, are almost as 
·guilty as the faculty. If students were 
more aware of what they were learn-
ing, they might be better equipped to 
weed out the silly theories thrown at 
them by biased professors. But be-
cause most students approach their 
classes trying only to satisfy the im-
mediate professor and grader, rather 
than actually absorb useful informa-

out thai white men are evil," or "Did 
you bow thai my father's fathers 
nped my mother's mothers?" 

WbaI these IIUdcIa fail to realize 
is !hit their profeaors are not here to 
ach them some undenilble truIh or 
the IIISWCI'S to life's problems, or, for 
that mauer, to subvert and corrupt 
these students for their own insipid 
motives. The professors are simply 
presenting their students with an ar· 
gument, often the result of years of 
research and study on their part. 

Professors are not hired to be liv-
ing tomes of pre-recorded knowledge. 
Rather, they are intellectual explorers 
who do research in order to find and 
present what they feel is worthy of 
consideration by their peers and stu-
dents. If professors ignored non-tra-
ditional beliefs simply because some 
students felt they were abandoning the 
narrow path of Western cultural 
thought, what sort of academics 
would they be? What use, then, would 
be the value of a college education? 

The term "conservative student" 

lion, they certainly won't waste their 
time analyzing the intricacies of each 
issue - mainly because they don't 
care. Sadly, it sinks in. The less they 
care, the less they question it - and 
the more readily they accept it as fact. 
This makes the professors' efforts that 
much easier, and their cute little 
games that much more effective. And 
because most students approach their 
classes with broad disinterest, profes-
sorS can get away with it all. 

Still , professors and administra-
tors do not simply stoop to imma-
ture tricks to sell their views. Of-
ten, they do not even attempt to hide 
their agenda. A cursory glance at a 
schedule of classes or course read-
ing list will validate anyone's con-
cern that modern universities are 
farther to the left than ever before. 
The typical quarter 's offerings show 
how the university has gone astray: 
only fcur United States history 
courses with almost twice as many 
Latin American studies courses. 
Two of the American history 
courses deal solely with women and 
their achievements, presumably in 
an attempt to right the past wrongs.

OPINION S 

is a paradox. Conservatives, who by 
tkfinition resist chance. cannot un-
derstand what it means to have a per-
spective different from their own. 
Students, on the other hand, come 
to a university in order to learn. To 
learn is to change, in some way or 
another. Only when professors re-
inforce everything the student has 
learned thus far will he not be 
deemed a radical. 

Fortunately, conservatives have 
never been able to stop the devel-
opment of humanity. Oh, people 
will cry foul when they see their 
traditional ways of thinking 
change right before their eyes -
especially if they were part of the 
ruling class a generation ago. Of 
course, if these people had pre-
vailed at any point in history, then 
mankind probably wouldn't have 
advanced out of the Stone Age. 
After all, fire is dangerous; and 
whoever thought about that 
"wheel" thing must have been one 
of those subversive communists. 

studies on workers in late 19th-cen-
tury factories, and how the evil capi-
talists cruelly exploited labor to 
make a profit. A course reading list 
can be equally revealing: The fact 
that students are forced .to buy their 
history books from a coptmunist 
bookstore (Groundwork· Books) 
says a great deal about UCSD's po-
litical agenda. 

If more students took the time to 
learn their course material, rather than 
simply coast through the classes, then 
we would be able to laugh at the 
university's leftist leanings. We would 
also be able to laugh at the use of the 
word "liberal" to discuss left·wing 
college environments. In truth, liberal 
implies open-minded, free-flowing 
thought and the challenging of old, 
stifling ideas. Modem universities are 
farther from such doctrines than most 
people can imagine. Instead, they are 
bastions of single-minded, overdone 
theories wbich hold little credibility 
outside of campus. Revisionist history 
and education on the whole are cer-
tainly cause for alann. Remember, the 
misinformed student of today will 
actually become the world leader of 
tomorrow.

SRTV Begins Programming 
8y Iv.n Delventh.1 
Associate News Editor 

Just a few years ago, SRTV (Stu· 
dent·Run Television) was only an 
idea being bouqced around by KSDT 
employees, 

Last week, however, SRTV -
the only, completely student-run 
television station in the UC system 
- became a reality. 

Currently. SRTV is on the air 
Monday through Friday, from 7 p.m. 
to 10 p.m. SRTV is a closed·circuit 
broadcast on channel 18 of Triton 
Cable and is available in all cable· 
equipped campus residences. In ad· 
dition. KSDT's signal will be sent 
out over SRTV during the new 
station's off-air hours. 

Although the bulk of program· 
ming presently consists of music 
vidcos, complemented by IO-minute 
newScasts several times per week, 
SRTV officials said they have plans 
to expand services in the near fu· 
ture. 

"When you start up a brand· 
new television station, you cannot 
program that much at a time," Stu· 
dent Cable Works Development 
Director Alexander Thiesen said. 
"Right now, we are on three hours 
aday, mostly [showing] music vid-
eos and whatever else we have on 
hand." 

InthHuture, SRTV plans to aira 
myriad of programs including high· 
lights of A.S. meetings, concerts 
filmed on campus, political talk 
shows, interviews with bands and 
live music, as well as student·made 
and independent films. 

"Students produce a lot of films 
that get thrown into archives," 
Thiesen said. 'This is a good way to 
submit work and show it to an audio 
ence." 

Thiesen estimates that by the end 
of the year, after the remaining resi-
dence halls on campus are connected 
to Triton Cable, between 4,000 stu-
dents and 5,000 students will have 
access to SRTV. 

"Students are our priority," said 
Student Cable Works General Man· 
ager Dominique Nuilez. "We are 
not try i ng to be like otherstations .... 
We want to do something educa-
tional and interesting." 

"When you have control of me-
dia for the benefits of others, you 
have been given something great; 
and you should not waste it," she 
added. 

By the end of this quarter, SRTV 
employees hope to increase broad-
casting time 10 four hours per day 
and include footage from weekly 
A.S. meetings. 

"In my mind, it would be terrific ' 
if we co'uld even air live sports 
events," Thiesen said. "I don 'Ilhi nk 
it would be too difficult because 
there are already fiber·optic cables 
running around campus." 

Over the last year, the A.S. has 
allocated nearly $60,000 to SRTV 
to help the station buy necessary 
start-up equipment. SRTV's oper· 
ating budget stands at nearly 
$15,000. double KSDT's current 
budget. Both KSDT and SRTV are 
part of the umbrella organization, 
Student Cable Works.

"I'm really excited about SRTV 
because J think it is. unique oppor-
tunity both for students to work at 
the station and for students on cam-
pus to see what others are doing," 
A.S. President Naomi Falk said. 

SRTV officials stressed that the 
goal of the station is to serve stu· 
dents, as well as to jnform them of 
events on campus and in San Diego. 

"Ultimately, our main goal is to 
make our TV station into a format 
similar to PBS," Thiesen said "We 
want to avoid stereotypical colle· 
giate sitcoms which interfere with 
the overall educational mission of 
the station." 

According to Thiesen, SRTV's 
debut last week was well-a:ceived 
by the campus community. 

"We've had people call saying 
they like the show and that they 
would like to see more of it," he 
said, adding that SRTV needs stu-
dent input. 

'The option is there for any stu-
dent to produce any genre of show 
within certain guidelines of de-
cency," Thiesen said, who encour· 
ages students to become involved in 
SRTV. 

Warren Television was the first 
television station established on 
campus, and plans are currently in 
the works to form stations at Revelle 
and Muircolleges. At present, SRTV 
is the only student·run station on 
campus. 

"We want to make it so that when 
you turn on SRTV, you can see 
things you can't find on any other 
station," Thiesen said.

Interactive Entertainment 

It'S the high-tech improvement on the old-fashioned computer game - Nintendo for the 21st century, so to speak. But ins~ of sitting on 
the living-room floor with a control 
pad in hand, Virtual World and 
Ultrazone players are involved in in-
teractivecontests which promote team-
work and present an opportunity to fire 
pot-shots at some of your closest 
friends. 

San Diego is home to two of the 
latest. modem entertainment forums: 
Virtual World - the virtual-reality, 
video-game center - and Ultrazone, 
an arena where participants engage in 
state-of-the-art laser-tag. 

Both places rely heavily on com-
puter technology and provide players 

with a chance to step out of the real 
world, if only for a few moments. 

Virtual World, a Mission Valley-
based company, arrived in November 
of 1993. Inside, it feels ' like a video-
game arcade for yuppies. Decked out 
in ornate brass and complete with a 
juice bar, Virtual World combines a 
healthy helping of Victorian-era am-
bience along ~th its interactive com-
puter action. 

Despite its elaborate decor, how- \ 
ever, it is the game itself which attracts 
the players. Virtual World's facilities 
can support up to 24 players at anyone 
time. with eight players competing in 
its three different games. Meanwhile. 
additional players are busy with pre-

Virtual World: Virtual Combat 

Inever even saw her coming. Pooka. a four-story-tall BattleMech tank loaded to the hilt with missiles and cannons. came at me from my weak side. At the helm of that fearsome death machine was 12-year-old Angela 
Carswell, and she was taking no prisoners. 

Frantically throwing my throttle into full reverse. I 
watched helplessly as pieces of my two-legged BattleMech 

were blown to bits. My computer 
screen shuddered with each new 
impact - red alarm lights flash-
ing out of control. My missile 
pack exploded, then my gun pod 
went up in flames . With the next 
volley. my left leg crumbled to 
the ground. 

Then, it was over. The lights 
dimmed and the computer screen 
went blank. Death in computer-
land can come quickly and vio-
lently - but at least itdoesn't last ' 
very long. After a few seconds to 
reflect upon what went wrong stra-
tegically. the lights flashed back 
on and I was reinserted into the 
game with a fresh BattleMech and 
a healthy desire for revenge. 

After the I O-minute duel came to an end. Angela and I 
met in the Virtual World lobby to discuss the finer points 
of high-tech warfare. It was a first mission for both of us. 

"I liked it because it was exciting and it was really loud." 
she said. "I like loud stuff."

Ultrazone: A Brave New World 

E verything was going smoothly. I had just neutralized the opponents' yellow base; now I hoped ~() rejoin my teammates and proceed to the 
red base. But I turned the comer and found no 
one - my team had vanished. Alone in the 
maze, I panicked. I envisioned an enemy 
behind every comer. hiding in every shadow. 

Holding my laser-gun at the ready, I care-
fully set out. Suddenly. without warning. a 
dark figure j umped in front of me. Instinc-
tively, I fired a shot that hit him in the chest. 

"Oops, sorry," I said. a moment too late. I 
had just deactivated my own teammate. He 
scowled. I made it a point not to tum my back 
on him for the rest of the game. 

This scenario describes just some of the 
goings-on at U1trazone, a mini-adventure 
which is far more than a mere video game. Its 
playing field is not a computer screen, but 
rather a 4,000 square·foot, two-level arena 
designed to look like an underground city of 

I 

the future. Contestants split up into three 
teams and then do their best to deactivate not 
only their opponents. but their enemies' bases 
as well. 

The result is a futuristic variation - with 
about 10 times the intensity - of " capture-
the-flag." Pulsating. techno-driven music! 
noise booms throughout the arena. amplify-
ing the tension of the game. Teammates yell 
at each other in order to communicate. Un-
seen enemies. meanwhile. can make as much 
noise as they want, without fear of being 
discovered. 

Each player has five targets on his body 
which can be fired upon by opponents. (f one 
of a player's shoulder sensors is hit, he is 
stunned and cannot fire for several seconds. 
While it's a good idea to hide after being 
stunned, refuge is not always possible. More 
often than not, opponents quickly move in and 
shoot the chest or back target.

10 FEA lURES 

VIRTUAL: 
Video game 
alternatives 
ContInued froIn ...... 
game training and post-game 
debriefings. 

What makes the game unique from 
run-of-the-mill computer games, ac-
cording to crew chief Ben Puchalski, 
is that Vinual World pits players 
against each other, rather than pre-
dictab\ecomputeropponents. With 00-
man contestants, "it's never going to 
be the same thing twice," he said. 

However, internet technology and 
the improving graphics capabi lities of 
home computers are making it tough 
for Vi nual World to maintain its niche. 

"We need to offer superior tech-
nology to get people off their buns," 
said Vinual World's Vice President 
of Finance and Planning Carl 
Greenberg. 

Because the inlemet allows play-
ers eJ log into video games from home, 
Greenberg sees it as a daunting chal-
lenge. According to Greenberg, Vir-
tual World is relying on people's de-
sire to be social- to \eave their pent-
up computer rooms - in order 10 
maintain its profitability. 

And to preserve its edge, Vinual 
World is planning to upgrade its sys-
tem later this year. 

'1benew sirnulator has an infinity 
optics system which tricks your eye 
into focusing on infinity. It's what 
military flight simulators use," 
Greenberg said. "It's a very high-
grade picture, as opposed to what 
looks like a cartoon going by your 
eye." 

Down the freeway from Vinual 
World lies Ultrazone, a center offer-
ing an experience above and beyond 

mere video games. 
"You dOn't have to like video 

games to like this," IJWIIFI" S~ 
Benjamin said. "This is like bcillJ 
wide a video game." 

San Diego's UIIt8ZOnc opened 
last August, joining 14 sites in the 
U.S. and 150 worldwide. Initially in-
troduced in Australia, U1trazone first 
popped up in the United Swes three 
years ago. 

Billed as the ultimate laser-tag 
adventure, it lives up to its hype. The 
technology and game set-up distances 
Ultrazone from the commercial laser-
tag games which appeared in toy stores 
a decade ago. 

"You can't do this in your living 
room," Benjamin said. "You have to 
come here." 

Players don high-tech vests carry-
ing lighted targets on theirchest, shoul-
ders and back. Phasers are also tar-
gets. The objective is simple enough: 
shoot down opponents and avoid in-
coming laser beams. 

Predictably, such high-tech games 
also come with heafty admission 
prices. For both of these space-age 
allcmati ves, expect to fork-over up to 
$9 for a 10 to 15 minute game. The 
enormous costs ofbui Iding and main-
taining such sites make the pricey fees 
a necessity. 

In fact, three years and millions of 
dollars were spent in the development 
ofVinuaJ World, even before the first 
site opened. On top of that, additional 
sites require a fresh $ 1.5 million to get 
off the ground-an intimidating cost 
which can be recouped only after years 
of booming business. 

But if their rapid expansion is any 
indication, Ultrazone and Virtual 
World are tuming healthy profits, sig-
nalling that these new entertainment 
fads may be the wave of the future.

Continued from pale 9 

At that point, sensors light up and 
the player's vest vibrates and emits a 
creepy deacti valion knell. Deactiva-
tion only lasts about 10 seconds, but 
it's not a pleasant feeling. 

Thanks to the arena's Iwo-Ievel 
design, deactivation can come quickly 
and from countless sources. What 
looks like an empty corridor can actu-
ally tum out to be something more, as 
unseen opponents on the second level 
can fire laser beams down from port-

holes in the walls and ceiling. You 
may never know what hit you. 

"It's kindoflikeadifferent world," 
said Robert Bautista, a frequenter of 
Ultrazone. "It's separate from reality. 
You can be anyone you want in here." 

"We're getting you to suspend 
disbelief," manager Steve Benjamin 
said. He calls Ultrazone the "adrena-
line playground." 

Though people are firing phasers 
at each other, Ultrazone is hardly a 
violent game. Two gamemasters en-
force rules forbidding running and 
unsportsmanlike conduct. 

Benjamin stresses thaI teammates 
must work together to achieve their 

objecti ves. 
"Don't go through the arena by 

yourself," he said. "Stay with a part-
ner or group of three. You ' ll do a 101 
better. .. . The goal is for the team to 
win, not for you to get a high SCOte." 

First-time players are encouraged 
to play more than one game; the first 
IS-minute session serves 10 orient the 
panicipants, who develop slrategy in 
the later games. 

"You must play twice to really 
appreciate this game," Benjamin said . 

Kimberly Connor, a frequent pa-
tronofUltrazone, notes lhateach game 
is unique. "Every time it's a different 
challenge."

BAT'I'LEMECH: 
Reality disappears at 
Virtual World 
Continued from ..... 9 

For every kid who whiled away an after-
noon sitting in a large cardboard box pretend-
ing to be at the helm of a space ship, Virtual 
World is a dream come true. The "video 
game" is played in a closed, dark cockpit -
replete with over 100 flashing buttons and 
switches, as well as status reports, weaponry 
readouts and tactical displays. 

At each game, eight people sit down in 
their cockpits and take control of their own 
space vehicle - either a two-legged tank in 
the game BattleTech or a souped-up flying 
freighter in the gamc Red Planet . In both 
games, the players challenge each other, not 
the pre-programmed computer. Games last 
about 10 minutes and run between $7 and $9. 

Both games stan off rather simply for 
beginners and get progressively more compli-
cated as players gain experience. 

After working at Virtual World for over a 
year-and-a-half, crew chief Ben Puchalski-
also known as "Spook," is something of an 
expert at both games. He's logged over a 
1,000 missions on each. 

BattleMech is definitely the more popular 
of the two - for reasons that become obvious 
as soon as your best friend appears in your 
crosshairs. 

"Basically you are trying to obliterate your 
opponents as many times as possible," 
Puchalski explained. "Your opponents can be 
friends, family members, loved ones and even 
total strangers."

Red Planet is something more of a drag 
race with guns. Players race each other with 
flying big-rigs which soar at speeds of over 
500 miles-per-hour, shoot on occasion and 
crash often. "It ends up like kind of a high-
speed demolition derby," said Puchalski. 

But the game is not relegated exclusively to 
the cockpit. Virtual World has gone to great 
lengths to create an entire society which re-
volves around the games. The idea, said 
Puchalski, is to create a "digital theme park, kind 
oflike Disneyland." The pilots are made mem-
bersofthe Vinual Geographic League,asociety 

of scientists and engineers supposedly staned in 
the 1890s. The lobby ofVinual World is full of 
"memorabilia" from the League. 

But for all the memorabilia and atmosphere, 
the real hook is the chance to play other people 
in an intricate and well-designed video game. 

"I love video games," said John Krueger, a 
veteran of 700 BattleTech missions. "What 
makes this different from other video games 
is the interaction with other humans ... . This 
isn't a computer chip. It isn't going to follow 
a set series of patterns. You never know what 
they 're going to do. That's the beauty of it."

Double Dose of,Defeat for UCSD 
DOWNER: The Division II UC Riverside Highlanders and the Chapman 
Panthers each dealt the Tritons a loss over the holiday weekend 
By M .. SUilp 
Staff Writer 

Unfonunately for the UCSD 
men's basketball team, the past 
weekend proved to be a downer, 

after a champion-
ship performance 
in the La Jolla 
Classic last Satur-
day night. 

UCSD' s record 
dropped to 7-9 af-
ler two losses on 
the road to UC Ri v-

erside and Chapman College. 
Friday night, the Tritons met 

UC Riverside and, as expected. 
fell to the Division II power, 103-
64. UCSD trailed early, due 
mostly to poor three-point shoot-
ing and a lack of offensive re-
bounds. The Highlanders domi -
nated the offensive and defensive 
glass. out-rebounding UCSD, 55-
31. 

The Tritons, trying to cut into 
the Riverside lead in the second 

half, continued to launch three-
point shots. The Highlanders were 
ready. keeping the Triton shoot-

ers out of their comfort zone and 
off balance, as UCSD finished 
the game 2-for-26 from beyond 
the arc. 

In what has become a season-
long trend. junior center Malt 
Aune led the Tritons in scoring 
and rebounding. He collected 20 
points on seven of II shooting 
and swiped seven rebounds. 

On Saturday, the Tritons trav· 
eled to rival Chapman University 
for a Division III battle. Still suf· 
fering the effects of the embar-
rassing loss to Riverside, UCSD 
couldn't knock down its open 
looks at the basket and lost 90· 
78. 

Triton Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier attributed the losses to 
the tough schedule. 

" Riverside was on a different 
level than we were." Lanthier 
said. "It's hard to come out after 
a blowout, both physically and 
mentally. " 

Aune continued his torrid scor-
ing pace. pour-
ing in 33 
points and 
pulling down 
14 rebounds 
against the 
Panthers. 

"[Aune] 
was definitely 

the best player we had on the noor." 
Lanthier said. "He might be the 
best player I've seen at this level." 

The key to the game was a 
four-minute stretch early in the 
second half when the Tritons held 
the Panthers scoreless - allow-
ing UCSD a chance to make a 
run. 

But, UCSD could not cash in 
on the opponunity and was held 
to only three points during that 
stretch. The Tritons would be 
unable to threaten again. 

Freshman forward Mike Wall 
hit four three-pointers and fin-
ished with 18 points. UCSD. how-
ever, played without two key 
players, who were lost to injury 
earlier in the week. 

Sophomore guards Jason 
Jone$ and Jason Barnes sat out 
both games, hampering the Tri-
tons' run· and-gun game plan. Be-
cause of the up-tempo style of 
play during the contest. the inju-
ries - coupled with the lack of 
outside shooting - proved detri -
mental. 

UCSD finished Friday night's 
contest shooting an abysmal 35 
percent from the Hoor. On Satur-
day, the team shot 42 percent, but 
was bested by the Panthers' stel-
lar 61 percent shooting. 

The Tritons are hoping that an 
upcoming. four-game homesland 
will provide some much-needed 
momentum. UCSD will open that 
stretch this Friday when they face· 
off against NAJA foe, The 
Master's College. 

TEST: Tritons

ContInued ftom ,... 18 
The 200-yard individual medley 
once again paired the rab fresh-
men, as Byrne captured second 
place (2: 14.76), while Monroe 
stormed to founh (2:15.61). 

"It was pretty much the fresh-
men show agai n," Boyd said. "The 
theme for the year is ail these fresh-
men doing well: Chu, Monroe, 
Irwin. Byrne. Jordan." 

The meet on Saturday afternoon 
was a much more competitive one 
in terms of placement for the Tri-
tons who. despite fielding half as 
many swimmers as the opposition. 
took the win on the women 's side 
and finished a distant. but respect-
able, second on the men' s side. 

David Tudury continued his im-
provement since coming over from 
the water polo team. winning the 
400 1M in 4:21 .67 and taking home 
a third-place mark in the 500 
freestyle (4:53). The 500 was a 
good race for UCSD as Tim 
McAteer (founh, 4:54) and Mark

to a double-digit lead. The Tritons 
stormed back in the second half, 
however, grabbing the lead jn the 
final minute of the game, 68-67. 

Their backs were then broken by 
astroke ofluck in Chapman 's favor.

ther guard fell shon. Chapman

Beiter (fifth, 5:02) also made their 
presence's felt . 

The women owned the meet, 
tallying 610 points and finishing 
135 points ahead of their nearest 
competition. 

"We're staning to swim faster 
together as a group," Boyd said. 

Race victories were turned in 
by a host of Triton swimmers. 
Irwin scorched the field in the 
freestyle events winDing both the 
50 and 100. 

Senior co-captain Carrie Parker 
reminded the youngsters of a vet-
eran'presence on the squad. as she 
took first in the 200 free (I :59.09) 
and the 100 (1:03.39) and 200 
(2: 16.23) backstroke races. Kristen 
Kemmer, another veteran. took 
first in the 200 butterfly with a 
time of 2: 18.68 . 

The Triton successes were 
rounded out by Byrne, Monroe and 
Chu . Byrne took first in the 200 
(2:14.12) and 400 (4:44.62) IMs, 
while Monroe and Chu took turns 
winning breaststroke events -
Chu took the top spot in the 100 
(I :09.08), while Monroe tri -
umphed in the 200 (2:29.58). 

picked up a funny bounce straight 
down from the rim, and sent it back 
for the 69-68 triumph. 

"Every team is out to get us," 
Malone said, "and if we ' re not 
playing the way we're capable of 
playing, then we will get bea .. " 

The weekend split put the Tri-
tons' season record at 8-4, with a 
tough game against Occidental this 
Friday and an arduous road trip to 
New York looming on the hon-
zon.

Bring Back the 
Bands ... Anned 

When did football halftime 
shows SlOp having anything to 
do with football? In college, it 
used to be that a haltime show 
consisted of the opposing 
schools' bands having a 
musical duel of sorts. On the 
pro level, the halftime bonan-
zas were most often marlced by 
local high-school bands tooting 
their horns in support of the 
home team. 

Nowadays, however, 
halftime "shows" have become 
the domain of big-money 
sponsors and laser-light 
spectacles which have about as 
much to do with football as the 
home shopping network. 

The plethora of college 

" 

football bowl games played 
over the New Year' s holiday 
was stomach-wrenching 
evidence of this fact. Take the 
Orange Bowl, for example. 
Two halves of smash-mouth 
football between national 
powers Notre Dame and FSU 
were placidly interrupted by a 
laser-light,extravaganza and 
dance routine unparalleled 
even in Las Vegas. 

The vaunted Orange BC?wl 
quickly became the largest 
karaoke bar on the planet, as 
some schmuck in a rented tux 

l: 
lip-synced to poor remakes of 
orignally shoddy tune . 
Meanwhile, an innumerable 
collection of spandex-clad 
dancers paraded about the 
field. 

Another mystery of football 
is this year's Super Bowl 
halftime blowout, whose big-
name talent is none other 
than ... D;ana Ros!>!? The only 
thing football fans know about 
Diana Ross is that she may be 
the only person on the planet 
with more out-of-control hair 
than Don King. 

.. Ross will no doubt be 
accompanied by a myriad of 
dancers, lasers and other 
useless paraphanalia which 
will adorn the field with smoke 
so thick that the teams will 
need gas-masks to resume play 
in the second half. All this in 
the name of the NFL? In my 
opinion. the goings-on of your 
average halftime show contain 
nothing of any interest to the 
average football fan . 

Perhaps the NFL should 
consider bringing back the 
baUle of the bands - with one 
slight modification: Namely, 
automatic weapons. We could 
equip the opposing bands with 
paint-ball uzi's, fully loaded 
with glow-in-the-dark paint. As 
a result. the laser lovers in the 
crowd will have the next-best 
thing: a night-time, paint-ball 
game with all the violence that 
a typical f~1I fan craves. 

This sort of radical change 
is desparately needed because, 
while there may be people out 

.. there in TV land who will 
enjoy a halftime speclKle such 
u the one IIIrrin. Ma. Ross. I 
would bet the fum that those 
foib .... ·l football fMa. 

SPLIT: After a last-
second loss Friday, 
UCSD ripped the Poets 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Often, a last-second defeat can 
deflate a team and have negative 
repercussions on the remainder of 

the season. Luckily, 
the UCSD women 's 
basketball team did 
not suffer this fate 
after a tough loss to 
visiting Chapman 
University on Friday 
night. The Tritons 
bounced back the 

very next night to s laughter 
Whittier, 98-67, and get their sea-
son back on track. 

" I was afraid that kind of loss 
would get us down," UCSD Head 
Coach Judy Malone said in refer-
ence to the Chapman loss. "But we 
played really well. Whittier was a 
good team; we just made them 
look bad." 

The Poets spent most of the 
evening trying unsuccessfully to 
contain the Tritons' leading scorer, 
Cindy Yamasaki . Yamasaki (22 
points, five three-pointers) had a 
knack for doing exactly what the 
Whiuier squad fail ed to accom-
plish - namely, knocking down 
threes .

able nine of 36 from behind the 
arc, contributing to the Tritons ' 
21-point halftime lead. 

UCSD showed little mercy in 
the second stanza, as it extended 
the. margin to 31 before the final 
buzzer sounded. The win was an 
especially sweet one for the Tri-
tons, considering the loss of start-
ing forward Karli Jungwirth, who 
has been an important part of the 
offense thus far in the season. 

Jungwirth, who is suffering 
from a possible case of tendemtis, 
was replaced by sophomore Sum-
mer Begley. Begley did not disap-
point, tallying 12 points and yank-
ing down 12 rebounds in the vic-
lory. 

"I think lhis was the first game 
where [Begley] really felt com-
fortable in there," Malone said . 

Tianna Meriage, another sopho-
more, also contributed off the 
bench in Jungwirth 's place, notch-
ing six points. Juniors Anne 
Westmore land and Sarah 
Schneider continued to play sol-
idly in the balanced UCSD attack, 
as they poured in eight and nine 
points, respectively . 

The dominating victory over 
Whittier was in stark contrast to 
the Tritons up-and-down perfor-
mance versus Chapman on Friday 
night. 

The Poets struggled mightily 
from distance, hooting a miser-

Quick whit?: Not quick enough, as the Tritons' Anne 
Westmoreland showed, beating a pair of Poets in the paint. 

The Panthers, a .500 team, took 
advantage of UCSD 's poor shoot-
ing in the first half by jumping out

IMPROVING: UCSD continued to swim better as a team in meets at Claremont and versus Michigan 
By Dan Kratt 
Sports Editor 

While the more important of 
UCSD' s two meets this weekend 
was certainly contested on Satur-

day afternoon , the 
one everyone was 
left talking about 
happened on Sun-
day, when the Tri-

and Linda Monroe 
(I : 10.87) took third and 
fourth, respectively, in the 
100 breaststroke. 

Jenny Irwin continued the 
freshmen theme, speeding 
across the pool in 25.62 to 
take third in the SO free and 
returning with an equally 
solid 55.71 in the 100 free.

cause from the outset, as Michi-

Division I title this season. How-
