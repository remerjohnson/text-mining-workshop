Arizona to Review 
Affirmative Action 
TEMPE, Ariz. - The Arizona 
State University Board of 
Regents unanimously passed a 
recommendation Tuesday 
directing all state universities 
to conduct internal studies of 
affirmative-action programs. 
The goal of ihe study is to 
determine whether university 
programs are "fair to both 
minorities and non-minori-
ties." Programs slated for 
review include admissions, 
student financial aid, student 
services and academic support. 
Recommendations for possible 
changes will be presented to 
the regents in June 1996.

AUSTIN, Texas - Female

substantially lower than their

to a University of Texas study

economics professor Daniel 
Hamermesh, who conducted 
the study, said that the 
campuswide results are 
representative of a national

Tea~hing Assistants Stage 'Grade-In,' 
Present Report Cards to Chancellor 
WORKLOAD: Graduate 
student union members protest . 
university non-recognition 
By Grace Jane 
Staff Writer 

Approximately 70 teaching assistants graded 
papers and held office hours in the Price Center 
Plaza between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. yesterday to 
showcase their work. 

According to Literature TA Molly Rhodes 
- a member of the Associated Student Em-
ployees/Union of Auto Workers (ASE/UA W) 
union - TAs collectively graded 38,000 pages 
this quarter. ASE presented this information, 
along with about 90 "report cards" grading the 
UCSD administration, to Interim Chancellor 
Marjorie Caserio's office. 

"The report cards allow students a chance to 

grade the administration on fees, c1as size, and 
present it to the chancellor," Warren writing T A 
Kate Burns explained. 

Caserio was unavailable for comment. 
"We're demonstrating that the university is 

not treating graduate students with the respect 
that they deserve," Graduate Student Associa-
tion (GSA) President Steve Dubb said. 

Dubb, a political science T A, said that the 
protest was to gain visibility and demonstrate 
the T As' discontent with the university's re-
fusal to recognize their union. 

"Graduate students very much deserve to get 
union status," Revelle senior and chemistry T A 
David Valentine said. "As an undergraduate, I 
am primarily here to learn. It's not my liveli-
hood, it's not my job to be a TA. For graduate 
students, however, that ha to be their sole 
means of support."

Clinton 
Concert 
Cancelled 
UNPWGGED: Only 400 
out of 3,000 tickets were 
sold as of Tuesday 
By Ivan Delventhal 
Associate News Editor 

Prompted by lackluster ticket sales, AS. 
DirectorofProgramming Kevin Moo pulled 
the plug Tuesday on the George Clinton and 
the P-Funk All-Stars co~cert, which was 
scheduled for Dec. 1. 

As of Tuesday, only 400 of the 3,000 
available tickets to the RIMAC concert had 
been sold. 

" It breaks my heart," Moo said, "but 
what I am doing is strictly about economics, 
and is in the best interests of the AS. and the 
concert in general." 

Moo allocated $46,000 for the George 
Clinton concert, which was billed as the 
most substantial AS. programming event of 
the fall quarter. Clinton and the P-Funk AII-
Stars who were to receive $22,500 for their 
performance, will negotiate with the A.S. 
programming office to determine how much 
they will be paid, although Moo said it is 
"out of the question" for the band to receive 
full payment. 

"When ticket sales were less than we had 
hoped, we tried to restructure the show so 
that it would occur in the Price Center Ball-
room and renegotiate the pay accordingly ... 
But Clinton didn't want to renegotiate," 
Moo said. 

The Programming office spent $4,000 
promoting the concert, placing ads in the 
UCSD Guardian, the San Diego Union-Tri-
bune and San Diego's Weekly Reader, in 
addition to paying for concert promotion on 
the hip-hop radio station, ZOO. 

"We ran a full-on promotion," Moo said. 
"The reason we had to cancel the show is not 
because of weak publicity." 

"This has everyone on the third floor [the 
A.S. offices in the Price Center] shaking 
their heads," he added. 

AS. President Naomi Falk refu ed to 
place blame for the failed concert on AS. 
programmers. 

"I want to empha ize that this was by no 
mean the fault of the programming office," 
Falk aid. "They did a really go d job put-

Site for New Dance

CONSTRUcnON: Building will be on south end

By Chris Schreiber In the ensuing discussion over

primary concerns included the issue 
of student safety during evening 
classes - namely because Site C is

Guardian Reporter 
In a meeting of the UCSD Cam-

pus Community Planning Commit-
tee (CCPe) Wednesday morning in 
the Price Center, CCPC members 
approved the location of a new dance 
department building by a tentative, 
12-3 vote. 

The new build-
ing will sit in the eu-
calyptus grove 
across from the 
Mandell Weiss Fo-
rum and Theater, 
adjacent to Weiss 
road. 

Many of the 
dancers present at 
the Wednesday 
meeting expressed 
pleasure over the 
proposed location of 
the new building. 

"We wanted to 
dance in our own 
space, and we 
wanted it to be a cre-
ative space, not one 
stuck in the middle 
of campus," said 
Muir sophomore 
Joy Clark. 

"Every dancer is 
an artist , and we 
want to make our art 
in an artistic part of 
campus,"sheadded.

pus, and the major-
ity of dance stu-
dents are female. 

The CCPC con-
cluded that those 
concerns should be 
addressed during 
the design phase of 
the facility . 

Certain CCPC 
members said the 
selected site was 
inappropriate and 
should be pre-
served for the fu-
ture needs of an 
expanding univer-
sity. 

"M y oJJfections

eas for theater per-
formances," CCPC 
member Sam 
Popkin said. "I 
don't think it's ap-
propria te to take a 
special piece of 
land for a building 
that could go else-
where. " 

Other CCPC 
-Joy Clark members, however, 

The selected site 
for the new dance 
department build-
ing, called "Site C," 
was recommended 
by both the Park 
Committee - an 
advisory committee to the CCPC-
and the dance department. 

Muir sophomore argued in favor of 
the proposed site. 

"No site is perfect. Our concerns 
about Site C were allayed when we 
looked at it," CCPe member Pat 
Ledden said. " It is appropriate to 
locate this facility in some part of 
the theater district, and Site C was 
the best site available in the theater 
district." 

The Park Committw,'which re-
views the ecological and biological 
ramifications of any proposed 
projects within the 350 acre campus 
park, stipulated that approval of the 
site will ,be contingent upon seve.ral 
items. These include: 

• The minimization of the num-
ber of trees disturbed by construc-
tion ofthe new facility 

• That parking should not occur 
on non-vegetated areas of the site 
and should only be allowed on as-
phalt parking areas 

• That the sculpture in the area 
should be preserved 

• That the site boundaries should 
be flexible in order to lose as few 
trees as possible. 

"The trees on the site aren't strong 
and should probably be replaced 
anyway ... and safety at night and in 
the dark will be considered [in the 
design]," Ledden added. 

Antione Predock & Associates 
have been contracted to design the 
new dance building. Predock 
pledged that the design will "inte-
grate with the grove area spiritually, 
functionally and historically," and 
will accommodate the future con-
struction of an additional theater.

UCSD Library Will Be Renamed Friday 
The University Library will be rededicated the Geisel

library's forum (third) level. 

Interim Chancellor Marjorie Caserio, university 
librarian Gerald Lowell, Geisel bioeraphers Neil and 
Judith Morgan and Audrey Geisel will speak at the 
event. 

A giant 'Cat in the Hat" balloon will be outSide the 
main entrance to the building, which received its new 
name in gold letters this week. A portion of the Dr. 
Seuss collection, which Audrey Geisel donated in 
1992. will be on display in the Special Collections 
area. 

The library is being renamed in honor of Audrey 
Geisel and the late Theodor Geisel, better known as 
Dr. Seuss. Audrey Geisel promised in September to 
give the library an unrestricted endowment of approxi-
mately $20 million, which Lowell said will probably be 
used to increase patrons' access to the library's 
contents and to teach undergraduates how to fully 
utilize that access. 

In case of inclement weather, the ceremony will be 
held in the Price .center Ballroom.

A.S. Appoints Academic 
Affairs Commissioner 
RESOWlIONS: 
Council approves 
Falk's stances 
By Esther Yoon 
Staft Writer 

The A.S. Council appointed 
Christy Guidi as Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs at Wednesday 
night's meeting, after reviewing 
the position 's two finalists . 

Councilmembers queslioned 
both candidates in a closed ses-
sion - excluding members of the 
public fro m the proceed ings. 

Guidi will assume office on 
Dec. 4, occupying Ihe post va-
cated by current A.S. Com mis-
sioner of Academic Affairs David 
Valent ine. Valentine is graduat-
ing at the end of the quarter. 

Following the closed session, 
co un c il members debated the 
implementation of Valentine's re-
ccnt appointments of A.S. repre-
sentatives. 

Allhough A.S. President Naomi 
Falk initially recommended that 
the council postpone Valentine 's 
appointments unlil Guidi takes 
office, she changed her mind after 
conferring with Guidi. 

" I withdraw that objection be-
cause the new commissioner did 
not object to the procedure," she 
said. 

The council also approved A.S. 
Commissioner of Programming 
Kevin Moo 's proposal to appoint 
Marshall College Commissioner of 
Programming Kathy Lee as chair of 
the Sun God Festival committee. 

In other matters, the council 
approved two resolutions authored 
by Falk in opposition to the 7.1-
percent fee increase recently pro-
posed by UC President Richard 
Atkinson, as well as the proposed 
UC-wide e-mail guideli nes. 

Falk also reported cutbacks to 
the OASIS tutorial programs and a 
significant loss of funding for tu-
toring in economics.

According to Moo, approxi-
mately 200 of the Clinton tickets 
were bought by UCSD students. 
However, Moo said he had antici-
paled much more interest in Ihe 
concert by the San Diego commu-
nity. 

"The student turnout was great; 
but in order to do these shows, we 
need community support - and 
we didn 't get it," Moo said. He 
added that at a typical RIMAC 
concert, approximately 10 percenl 
of attendees are UCSD students. 

Moo said Clinton's promoters 
urged him to put on the show de-
spite the limited ticket sa les, tell-
ing him that he could theoretically 
sell 1 ,500 lickets between midweek 
and the day of the concert, and that 
he could also sell approximately 
500 tickets on a walk-up basis the 
night of the even/.

Pungaew said. "For some reason,

ket... At other concerts, sometimes 
50 percent of ticket Sales are on

Bul Moo said he wasn't in a 
position to take " that sort of 
gamble." 

The programming office works 
with an annual allocation of 
$146,000 - the largest budget of 
any A.S. office. However, Moo is 
not required to present a budget for 
each event the programming office 
organize~.

Although Falk said a "small 
minority" of A.S. councilmembers 
are concerned about the size of the 
programming budget as well as 
"I he liberty with which the pro-
grammingofficespends[money)," 
she said the office needs a certai n 
degree of leeway to conduct busi-
ness. 

"The programming budget is 
the largest A.S. budget, but at the 
same time it needs to be; it takes 
money to get good acts," Falksaid. 

Despite the cancellation, Moo 
said he is optim istic for the remai n-
der of the year. 

"It is not the last show we will 
do," Moo said, "there are many 
shows on the horizon that we are 
working on. I wanted to do the 
Clinton concert, bUI that's part of 
the game." 

"If you can ' t handle disappoint-
ment, you shouldn't be in this busi-
ness," he added. 

Those in possession of a ticket 
for Ihe Dec. 1 concert are entitled 
to a refund from the point of pur-
chase.

A.S. Programming Should 
Not Sta t Costly Precedent 

AS. Commissioner of Programming Kevin Moo isn't 
completely to blame for the George Clinton and the. P-Funk 
All-stars fiasco. Despite grumblings by a few local promot-
ers that Ointon belongs in a smaller venue, Moo did all he 
could to fill the 3,OOO-seat RIMAC show. He dove head-
first into promoting the event, putting ads in the San Diego 
Union-Tribune, The Reader, and on the radio station Z90. 

Luckily, the AS. covered its tail on the concert's mon-
etary loss by using cash from a "slush fund" of last year's 
extra profits. No money had to be removed from other 
funds, and the Sun God festival - perhaps the most impor-
tant AS.-sponsored event - will be untouched by the loss. 

However, even though the A.S. dodged the bullet this 
time, the Ointon cancellation brings a more important issue 
to light. That is, Kevin Moo and the AS. Programming 
office still does not have an official, detailed budget for the 
year. In fact, he is the only programming commissioner in 
UCSD's history not to have a line-item budget. 

Every other AS. office, from external to media to 
academic affairs, is guided by its own organized budget, yet 
Moo is allowed to have free reign. It's time for Moo to 
clarify where all of his money is going ahead of time. AS. 
programming has put on some great concerts this quarter, 
but it should not start a dangerous (and potentially costly) 
precedent by declining to put forth a comprehensive budget. 
The expensive outcome of the Ointon non-concert only 
highlights this fact. 

Several months ago, the UC Office of the President 
(UCOP) drafted a general-usage policy for e-mail in the UC 
system. While it is necessary to establish guidelines for such 
a widely used system, the ambiguity of the UCOP's draft 
leads to invasion - and not protection - of one's privacy. 

By employing vague guidelines for e-maH users, this 
draft allows university officials to read our accounts and to 
decide who is allowed access to e-maH, thus violating our 
basic right to privacy. 

The proposal states that its purpose is to inform the 
university community about "confidentiality, privacy and 
acceptable use of e-mail." But this statement is testament to 
how dangerous the document is. University officials cannot 
possibly define "acceptable use" without reading accounts. 

"Acceptable use" is such a vague term that university 
officials would be able to use any excuse to confiscate 
someone's e-mail account. Though the proposal states that 
e-mail will be subject to the same laws, policies and prac-
tices that apply to other means of communication, state-
ments such as "The university has the right to access and 
disclose the contents of a user's e-mai! messages .. .for 
legitimate university operational purposes," prove that the 
UCOP has no intention of protecting our right to privacy. 

Another disturbing aspect of the proposal is the access 
clause, which states that faculty, staff, students and affiliates 
of the university are allowed access only for the use of 
"university purposes." The purpose of this statement 
becomes clearer when employee union representatives are 
cited as one example of affiliates whose e-maiJ use is uSed 
for "non-university" purposes. Non-university seems to 
denotate "actions displeasing 10 university officials," which 
could be anything from insulting an administralor to plan-
ning a protest. 

By allowing censorship of e-mail and by deciding who 
can use e-mail, UCOP's proposal enforces a totalitarian 
state on campus. It is against the law to open a letter ad-
dressed to someone else, and the same rule should stand for 
e-mail. The vague wording of the draft gives free license to 
university officials to invade oUr privacy.

MOURNING THE DEATH OF

Rewon 

TIle headline smaclted me in 
the face jllll U I reached the front 
door. "Calvin twlHobbes to end 
Dec. 31." I dropped my &In Di-
ego Union-Tribune and slumped 
down on the porth to catch my 
breath. It had finally happened. 
My wont nightmare had come 
true: Bill Watterson was retiring. 

As I stared out through the 
barren trees on that cold Novem-
ber morning, I could feel a put 
of myself dy-
ing. It went far 
beyond losing a 
minor form of 
entertainment. 

modem man's struggle with the existence of God. Calvin 
wanted to believe in Santa a.us, but always had trouble 
because of the iUogica1 and far-fetched theories surround-
ing him. At the same time, his belief in Santa Claus wa-
vered depending on his part~1ar needs. When it be-
hooved him to believe in Santa Claus and to behave well 
(to receive presents), Calvin did so. But when that belief 
became a burden, he quickly dispensed with it: If there 
were no Santa Claus, he could get away with throwing a 
snowball at Susie Derkins. Thus, Calvin temporarily sus-
pended his belief in Santa Claus when the belief became 
inconvenient, just u most people seem to do with their 

faith in God. 
Simultaneously, Watterson critiques 

modem society and its institutions. 
Calvin and Hobbes' numerous conver-
sations while walking through the woods 
take subtle jabs at various faults in soci-
ety. Most often, Watterson justly criti-
cizes theAmerican masses for their herd-
like mentality or their willingness to be 
'controlled by the media - namely,tele-
vision and advertising. 

Calvin and Hobbes were real, and the 
comic strip provided hope that I might 
one day succeed in the same manner as 
Watterson. But with news of his retire-
ment, grief overwhelmed me; I needed 
a few minutes of private time with my 
Calvin and Hobbes book collection. 

Thankfully, I had been able to ap-
preciate the true genius of Calvin and 
Hobbes long before W.tterson an-
nounced his retirement. His comic strip 
stood alone. It combined aspects of phi-
losophy, human nature and social com-
mentary - all brilliantly meshed with 
an appropriate dose of humor. Watterson 
managed to convey incredibly detailed 
and complex messages using the comic 
strip, of all things, as his medium. Yet, 
he overcame its restrictive nature and 
shared his thoughts with the world, all 
through the eyes of a six-year~ld child.

Job provides

Watterson also demonstrates the 
faults of the modem education system. 
When Calvin takes initiative and devel-
ops a school project far more creative 
and insightful than the rest of his class-
mates, he is penalized for going beyond 
the bounds of the assignment. At the 
same time, however, Watterson blames 
the average student for expecting the 
education system to pander to him, rather 
than merely allowing him to take from it 
what he chooses. When Calvin protests 
that his failure to learn shows the ineffi-
ciency of the system, his teacher points 
out that an education is only worth the

show that human nature tends toward conflict. That is, 
humans arc more likely to come to blows over compet-
ing beliefs than to compromise. He also masterfully jux-
taposed Hobbes ' philosophy with John Calvin 's theory 
of predestination to raise questions regarding the struggle 
within each human being: a desire to give in to the evil 
side of human nature, versus a rational attempt to fasten 
a typical human existence. 

Calvin, for example, constantly grappled with the ex-
istence of Santa Claus, presumably representative of 

Still; Watterson's greatest strength 
was to show how modem society directly conflicts with 
human ilature. The endless momings Calvin spends wait-
ing for the school bus show this paradox: He stands in 
the pouring rain, pointing out how all the students and 
teachers would actually prefer to be back in bcd. Calvin 
also constanlly laments about how life is nothing more 
than school and work; there is no time for fun. He struggles 
to break free from lhe shackles of modem society, to spend 
his time enjoying the true-pleasures of life. Calvin abso-

COMMENTARY: A combination of campus living conditions, socially segregated enclaves and common college 
cliques creates a boring and lackluster environment at UCSD 

UCSD's SOCIAL LIFE LIES DORMANT 
By BrIce Ritter 
Staff Writer 

When the UC regents created 
the educational powerhouse 
known as UCSD, they inadvert-
ently created a sociological study: 
a model of society showing how 
people stick together in exclusive 
groups. 

UCSD is a school with more 
than 16,000 students, approxi-
mately the size of the quintessen-
tial small town in which every-
body knows everybody - or at 
least something about them. How-
ever, UCSD shares none of this 
small -town allure. The atmo-
sphere has more of a reserved "big 
city" feel of isotated neighbor-
hoods and communities, virtually 
removed from any sense of the 
"real world ." 

Our college years generally 
suspend us from many of the re-
alities awaiting us after gradua-
lion, such as a routine work 
schedule and regular bills and 
payments. But above all, we can 
temporarily avoid the stress of 
knowing that we have no guaran-
tee of employment. 

Of course, school imparts a 
unique set of "pressures" similar 
to the real world, which keep us 
stressed enough; but the social 
life at UCSD does not reflect the 
liveliness and energy indicative of 
an average large collection of 
young people. Instead, UCSD's 
social atmosphere resembles 
something more akin to high 
school, characterized primarily by 
cliques, each separating into its 
own world once school ends. 

UCSD is a commuter school 

- unlik~ Davis, UCLA or Berke-
ley; and, as a result, our univer-
sity suffers a social deficiency, 
typified by closed circles. Some 
people choose to sit around and 
complain about it, but at the same 
time, they often become part of the 
problem. 

A walk across campus reveals 
al least four social satellite com-
munities. It's like a stroll through 
the Wild Animal Park, observing 
how certain species congregate to-
gether. Because we are nothing 
more than social animals our-
selves, we too have a tendency to 
collect into packs, consisting of 
circles of friends continually or-
biting each other. This propensity 
can be fully understood by em-
barking on a UCSD "park tour. " 

At Revelle College, we find a 
typical example of a freshman dor-
mitory community with its own in-
bred culture. These people live in 
little housing projects, eat in the 
same cafeterias and wash their 
laundry together. Naturally, they 
learn a lot about each other, but 
little about any other students. And 
before anyone explores other so-
cial avenues, ii 's already time to 
move out. 

Despite spending five years at 
UCSD, I am still best friends with 
the people I met during my first 
·two years while living in the on-
campus dormitories. Without this 
"acculturation," I wonder what 
would have induced or allowed me 
to meet the friends I now have. 

The old Student Center, as typi-
fied by the co-ops, represents the 
next ofthe fou r social circles. The 
Student Center resembles the U.S.

small droves of

most other social 
groups, the Greeks

military base in Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba - not for military reasons, 
but because the old Student Cen-

ter is the last remnant of the cam-
pus infrastructure not designated 
in the UCSD Master Plan. It's the 
last place on campus reminiscent 
of a small-town atmosphere, pok-
ing up out of an otherwise indus-
trial region. 

We can see the species of this 
social environment lounging 
around on the Hump, a setting so 
natural that the locals take little 
notice of who or what passes by 
on the walkway from Revelle to 
Muir. Those involved in co-ops 
maintain a reputation for being 
liberals - evil liberals. They host 
pot lucks. They like candlelight 
vigils and wine. They support any-
thing which is anti-regents. 

This earthy, naturat enclave, 
which reflects the humble origins 
of UCSD, has been thrown out of 
polarity by the campus ' develop-
ment to the north and east. No 
longer can the co-op culture pit 
itself against the docile commer-
cial giant, in the trlie center of 
campus. 

This part of our "park tour" 
brings liS to the Price Center, where 
we find assorted pockets of social 
life. Here, a high concentration of 
Greeks inhabits the food court, 
moving about in small droves of 
three to four. These sightings, how-
ever, reveal little about their secret 
societies. Like most other social 
groups, the Greeks take their fun 
elsewhere, far away from the UCSD 
campus. They flee to distant loca-
tions and celebrate within their 
closed circles, thereby adding to 
what has become a social ghostown. 

Also easily identifiable at the 
Price Center complex is the 

Espresso Roma herd. This bunch of 
squatters all seem to know one an-
other. The "Romans" are primarily 
made up of sophisticated smokers, 
coffee junkies and those who pose 
as students loaded with homework. 
They usually engage in simple cof-
fee talk and patronize cafes for so-
cial diversion. After their inconse-
quential cappucino chats, however, 
these people take their fun else-
where as well. 

The dormers, the co-opers, the 
Greeks and the Romans all repre-
sent only a tiny fraction of the so-
cial infrastructure at UCSD. But 
their behavior illustrates how social 
chasms can make interaclion be-
tween groups difficult and 
undesi reable, at best. Yet, beneath 
the dormant, fruslraled surface, a 
potenlially bountiful and broadened 
social life awaits us. We just have 
to figure out how to tap into it. 
Hopefully, TGs at Porter 's Pub and 
public debates, like the "Day of 
Action," can establish a foundation 
for future student interaction at this 
school. 

Much of our social character is 
based on the fact that UCSD sits 
atop a hill in La Jolla, surrounded 
by alienating riches, high rent and 
an absence pf a college town atmo-
sphere. These characteristics sub-
vert any sense of a progressive, 
lively community. Instead, it reeks 
of old conservatism and disbands 
the importance of a healthy, univer-
sity social life. For these reasons, so-
cial life at UCSD runs in herds, 
away from campus and aviay from 
the high-intensity interaction that 
should enliven and enrich a univer-
sity education.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thursday, November 30,1995 

COMMENTARY: Our country is witnessing a depressing and frightening trend of victimization - no one has the 
integrity or patience to accept responsibility for his actions 

CAN RESPONSIBILITY REPLACE VICTIMIZATION? 
By Chris Schr.lber 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

A very disturbing trend has 
been hiding its cowardly face 
among us for some time, and now 
it seems more pronounced than 
ever. I am referring to the lack of 
spine and moral principle of an 
already large segment of the popu-
lation, one which seems to be in-
creasing exponentially: people 
who cannot bring themselves to 
take responsibility for their own 
actions. 

The news is replete with stories 
of these nincompoops, and the de-
pravity starts from the very top. To 
paraphrase our fearless leader, Bill 
Clinton, it wasn't his fault that he 
raised taxes; it was those dastardly 
Republicans who didn 't help him 
factor in the extreme positions of 
congressional Democrats. (Those 
darn Republicans.)

nese. When a politician in Japan 
is involved in a scandal, he resigns 
in shame over his misconduct, tak-
ing full responsibility for his ac-
tions. We, on the other hand, have 
Bob Packwood needing the threat 
of forcible expulsion to step down 
- and, even then, not having the 
decency to publicly apologize for 
his actions. 

Nothing anyone does is his own 
fault, especially if it turns out un-
favorably. To cite a rather famous 
and particularly poignant ex-
ample, consider the woman in 
Texas who sued the McDonald's 
corporation for millions of dollars 
when she scalded herself with hot 
coffee - which she had spilled on 
her own lap. 

McDonald's was at fault, of 
course, because the coffee was too 
hot; never mind that most people 
actually want their coffee steam-
ing hot in the morning. Perhaps 
McDonald 's should have posted a

lutely cannot force himsclf to amcen-
trate on his school work; ii fails to 
interest him at all, and the prospect of 
wasting his life in an office scares him 
even more. Hence, we see the re-
peated jabs at his poor father, trudg-
ing oft' to work on beautiful summer 
mornings. 

Watterson, on the other hand, has 
successfully broken free from these 
constraints. He has been fortunate-
or intelligent - enough to have 
people pay him to do what he enjoys. 
Not many people can claim that their 
work is one of their greatest joys. 
Watterson's job also provides maxi-
mum profit with minimum labor. He 
has millions of dollars and now end-
less free time to enjoy it. 

Moreover, Watterson foun~ an 
outlet for his personal views. Through 
his comic strip he conveyed to all 
readers what he felt about human na-
tun: and modem society - a luxury 
most of us want, but few of us have. 
It takes significant intelligence and 
skill to explain oneself clearly and to 
have people even consider one's theo-
ries. But most remarkable is that 
Watterson never lost sight of his con-
text: a humorous oomic strip. Through 
all his philosophical and moral 
musings, Watterson still made his 
readers laugh. 

Interestingly, Watterson cited the 
constraints of newspapers and pub-
lishing companies as reasons for his 
retirement. He claimed that they hin-
dered his artistic creativity. As much 
as most of us an: sad over his deci-
sion, it beats watching his comic strip 
lose its integrity or brilliance. 

Even if most Calvin al/d Hobbes 
readers didn't bother 10 analyze the 
intricate commentaries and theories 
Watterson was espousing, they cer-
tainly appreciated the humor and the 
charactcrs'personalities. With such an 
intuitive understanding of human n,,-
ture and an extraordinary ability to 
express emotions, Watterson made the 
characters come alive. 

After reading every frame of ev-
ery strip he has ever published, I know 
Calvin and Hobbes, Calvin's parents, 
Susie Derkins, Moe the bully, Miss 
Wormwood and Rosa lyn , the 
babysitter, better than I know some 
of my acquaintances. I know that 
Calvin's parents seriously question 
whether or not they should have had 
him. I know Calvin is a genius, even 
though he gets Fs in school, and I 
know Calvin will forever be tortured 
by the trappings of the modem world. 
So, when Bill Watterson retires, 
Calvill and Hobbes, the comic strip, 
may end, but the characters will never 
die.

that - come hell or high water -
he would take responsibility for 
his own actions. We need more of 
such stand-up behavior today. 

If you're one oft hose people who 
can 't ever be held accountable for 
anything you do, take a long look at 
old George or even at Henry David 
Thoreau. Like many of our beloved 
baby-boomer parents, Thoreau was 
against war; his particular moral ar-
gument was with the Mexican-
American War, as opposed to Viet-
nam. He broke the law in a consci-
entious display of civil disobedi-
ence, and then he took the due pun-
ishment under the law, without a 
word of protest. The victimized 
American public should do the rest 
of us a favor: grow a spine and take 
responsibility for yourselves.

Continued from .,... 8 

According to Revelle Provost 
Tom Bond, the TA stipend is in-
tended to cover living expenses 
and is not a payment for services. 

"I don ' t think it 's appropriate 
that TAs unionize," he added. 
"They are students doing their re-
search and teaching as part of their 
graduate education." 

However, literature T A An-
thony Navarrete questioned the 
differences between graduate stu-
dents and beginning professors at 
UCSD. 

"I'd like to see a first -year as-

learning as he goes along," hesaid. 
"You're no longer a useful aca-
demic if you're notlearning. Ifthe 
argument that if you ' re learning as 
you go along makes you a student 
rather than an employee [is valid], 
then there are no employees." 

Several T As complained that

Disney's latest film, Toy Story, 
isn't just a high-tech wonder 

-

OY STORY HAS 
been widely 
promoted as 
"the world's 
first, fully com-
puter-animated 
movie." All the 

hype about the film '5 tr.chnology 
isn't wasted- ToySlory isa wildly 
imaginative and original film well 
worth watching. The 
computer-generated 
animation (a product of 
the animation studio, 
Pixar)iswithoutadoubt 
better than eny previ-
ous attempt, a true 
showcase of just how 
much computer anima-
tion has progressed. 

Aside from the 
breathtaking computer 
wizardry, Disney should also get 
credil for its recruitment of a wide 
assortment of voices. Many will be 
pleasantly surprised to hear the likes 
offomHanlcsasthevoiceofWoody, 
the pull-string cowboy, and Tim 
Allen as the voice of tbe ultimate 
action figure, space ranger Buzz 
Lightyear. 

Toy Story is based on the idea 
that toys wme to life when no one is 

watching, a belief, no doubt, held by 
many of us as young children. Not 
only are the toys in the film alive, but 
they recognize tbey are toys, ap-
proaching this reaJi~y as an oocupa-
tion to take very seriously. Woody 
happens to be young Andy's (the 
main human character) favorite toy 
since kindergarten. As a result, 
Woody enjoys the envy and admira-

tion bestowed upon 
him by his fellow toys, 
who make him their 
leader. However, a 
toy's greatest fear, 
along with being lost 
or broken, is to be re-
placed by !IOIIIething 
new. 

Andy, on his birth-
day, receives the high-
tech, electronic-talk-

ing, karate-chop-action-hero Buzz 
Lightyear. Buzz immediately wins 
the admi ration of the other toys, who 
are quite impressed with his array of 
features a child could enjoy. A3. a 
result, he quickly becomes Andy's 
new favorite, leaving an envious 
Woody a distant lIeIXlnd. Buzz has 
an amusing personality, primarily 
because he is completely oblivious 
to the fact that he is a toy. 

Courtlly 01 tile 
..... : The toys in Toy Srorycome to life when the kids are away. 

Thecrisisofthe film begins when 
a jealous Woody "accidentally" 
knocks Buzz out tbe window, result-
ing in Woody's ostracization by his 
fellow toys. Woody's exile forces 
him to work with Buzz to get back to 
Andy before his family moves away 
to a house the two toys might never 
find. Meanwhile, a neighborhood 
menace - the demented, toy«-
stroyingSid- blocks theirprogress. 

The humor in Toy Story is 
clever, ranging from simple sight 
gap to humorous bils. However, 
many will probably remember only 

the animation, which is just as well, 
because it is quite different from 
anything that has graced the big 
screen. Several years down the 
road, after Pixar has created sev-
eral more computer-animated fea-
tures and the novelty wears off, 
emphasis will ultimately be placed 
on lhe storyline. But iffuture films 
are IS well written IS Toy Story, 
audiences will be dazzled by spec-
tacular computer graphics along-
side truly entertaining stories. 

Toy Slory is showing at theaters 
throughout San Diego.

Night Falls Short 
or Its Intentions 

When Night is Fallingpromises 
erotic tension, but delivers satire 
By Elysia Paladino 
Guardian Reporter 

When Nigh/Is Falling is a lofty 
attempt at poetic ro-
mance by Ca nadian 
writer/director Patricia 
Rozema. However, her 
vision falls short and the 
film inadvertently 
verges on satire. 

Cam ille (Pascale 
Bussieres), a professor 
at a Protestant college, 
is engaged to long-time 
lover and fellow pro-
fessor, Martin (Henry Czerny). The 
university chaplain (David Fox) 
pressures them to marry in order to 
prove that their values are in sync 
with those of the school. This pres-
sure forces Camille to take a harder 
look at her life, and when she re-
turns to her office to find outthat her 
beloved dog has run away and died, 
she loses her grip. 

In her already weakened state of 
mind, Camille runs into Petra 
(Rachael Crawford), a whimsical, 
flamboyant circus performer who 
seduces Camille into a dream-like 
state of infatuation, further compli-
cating her relationship with Martin. 

The characters in the film are 

depicted as modern-day mythologi-
cal archetypes. Camille, the intel-
lectual professor analogous to 

Psyche, leaves her ra-
tiona I life behind when 
she falls in love with 
Petra, a Cupid arche-
type. In fact, the story 
has all the makings of a 
Raphaelian fantasy. 

But Rozema's in-
triguing social com-
ment - regard ing a de-
sire to escaPe from a 
life ofwproper" Protes-

tant repression to live instead in 
pursuit of satisfying the indulgent 
cravings of the soul - is clouded 
over in a haze of insufficiently de-
veloped character relations, cliched 
dialogue and stinted acting efforts. 

Neither Camille's telationship 
with her long-time fiance, Martin, 
nor her infatuation with new-found 
romance, Petra, are ever substanti-
ated enough to be believable. 
Cliched, corny dialogue like, Wl'd 
love to see your head thrown back in 
the moonlight...," and, "Sometimes 
I fantasize about running away from 
the circus," come across as embar-
rassingly brash and satirical. And 
none of the acting in the film is

• Cou rtesy of October Film s 
ComplIcated kI .. : Camille (Pascale Bussieres, on left) may be engaged to a man, but she falls in love 
with Petra (Rachael Crawford, on right) in Patricia Rozema's When Night is Falling. 
passionate enough to support its aim. 

Redeemable features of the film 
are few and far between. The cin-
ematography of Douglas Koch gives 
the picture a beautiful appearance . 
and helps set the right tone for the 
different scenes. Also worth men-
tioning is the guest performance by 

the Stebens sisters, identical-twin 
trapeze artists of Cirque du Soleil 
fame. Rozema uses them to com-
ment on the synchronicity of 
women's bodies as she makes the 
analogy between the sisters in the 
trapeze act and the lovemaking of 
Camille and Petra. 

These elements put When Night 
Is Falling somewhere ambiguously 
between comedy .and tragedy, but 
nowhere near its ambitious mark of 
Ingmar Bergman's poem, from 
which it took its name. 

When Night Is Falling opens to-
morrow at the Hillcrest Cinemas.

Make Way For 
Rock's New Boss 

Boss Hog'sfirst extensive tour brings the 
band to the Casbah tomorraw night 

By Jeff Nlesel 
Hiatus Editor 

When Boss Hog recorded its latest, self-
titled album, band members found 
themselves listening to R&B 
records by the likes of Ike and Tina 
Turner. The result is the group's 
best work to date. 

Originally formed in 1988 by 
guitarist Jon Spencer (formerly of 
Pussy Galore, currently of The Jon 
Spencer Blues Explosion) and 
Cristina Martinez, who is now 
married to Spencer, Boss Hog re-
leased two albums (the cassette-
only EP Drillkill ', Lechill ' and Lyill ' and Cold 
Hands) before replacing its original drummer 
and bassist with Hollis Queens and Jens 
Jurgensen. 

Boss Hog's 1993 EP, Girl +, signaled a 
breakthrough for the band, which began to 
explore the kind of R&B song structurcs for 
which Spencer has now become famous. Dur-
ing a recent phone interview, Queens spoke 
about the band's first extensive tour, which 
includes a stop at the Casbah tomorrow night. 
GUMdun: You lived in San Diego for 
a short time after high school. What 
was that like? 

Queens: I hated Southern California, to be 
frank. At that time, everybody was just a 
stupid, fucking moron with blonde hair. I put 
on a black wig and painted my face white. I 

was a deejay at the radio station at San Diego 
State, when I went to school there. I got 
kicked off the air. I really didn't know what 

the fuck I was doing. I would do 
different voices and sing between 
songs. When I was at State, I actu-
ally moved to London on an ex-
change program. London was 
much better to me than Southern 
California, so I thought it was the 
shit. 
So h"w did you end up in 
Boss Hog? 

I met the band because I was 
going out with Kurt Wolf, the 

guitar player. He also played in Pussy Galore. 
Ifhe had stayed in Boss Hog, the band would 
have sounded less sparse than it does now. 
Then, I went out with Jens Jurgensen, the bass 
player. I met Cristina Martinez on a video 
shoot. The original Boss Hog drummer, 
Charlie Ondras, had died, and I mentioned to 
Cristina that I would like to jam with the band. 
I kind of had to learn from scrateh because I 
didn ' t really know how to play. I know how to 
play now. 
I read that Cristina perfonned naked 
at Boss HOC'S first concert. Is this 
..".? 

I don't think so. She often dresses very 
scantily and doesn ' t wear underwear and high 
miniskirts. She doesn't need to perform naked 
anyway .

Courtesy of Michaellavine 
Bo .. expIG.ion: Boss Hog (Jon Spencer, Cristina Martinez, Hoilis Queens and Jens 
Jurgensen) has released a self-titled album and wiil play tomorrow at the Casbah. 
Do you think the latest Boss Hog 
album is the band's best? It's much 
better than Cold HMds. 

I don 't think Cold Hands was mixed very 
well, but I like all the early Boss Hog music. 
We perform some early songs Hve,.and I think 
they sound better live. With the latest album, 
the lyrics weren't done until the album was 
being recorded, so most of the songs weren't 
performed live before being recorded. I think 
the new album definitely shows an evolution. 
It has a more distinct sound. 
What were you listening to while 
recording the album? 

We listened to a lot of Ike and Tina Turner. 

Before every show. we listen to a few of their 
songs before we go on stage. I think Jon 
[Spencer) turned us on to their music. I re-
spect both of them as musicians. 
How does Boss Hog compare with 
Jon Spencer Blues Explosion? 

I think there are a lot of similarities because 
Jon plays in both bands. Boss Hog songs are not 
as intricate as their songs. Our. songs are much 
more straightforward, and I think the two bands 
will go in different directions. Cristina ap-
proaches lyric and songwriting in a completely 
different manner. It's ~mazing Boss Hog has 
comeas far as it has, given theamountoftimewe 
have put into the band.

t n a perfect world, the holiday season would not involve as much connivery as it does . Tabulated gift exchanges, dropped hints and mind games maintain 
an even flow of exchange and simulated 

holiday cheer between loved ones. 
The holiday shopping season is not the time 

of perpetual joy and festivity we assume it to be; 
it actually brings more distress and chaos to our 
lives than we'd like. With that in mind (as well 
as the awareness that college students have 
very lillie money to spend), a holiday shopping 
list may simplify the process: 

Undel1"ear is simple. It's cheap. Everyone 
needs underwear. "Classic" Calvin Klein box-
ers with polka dots are $i2; J. Crew's boxers 
are between $10 and 14, and come in lots of 
cutesy animal motif-designs; the Victoria 's 
Secret holiday catalogtle is user-friendly and 
features its own gift packages ... Edible under-

wear (it's something most people have seen, 
but can 't testify to testing out). 

Toiletries are also simple and prepackaged. 
Men 's travel toiletry kits (nice ones) are be-
tween $30 and $50. Lancome, Estee Lauder 
and Chanel cosmetic counters, located in most 
department stores, feature gift packages with 
signature fragrances and compacts between 
$25 and $60. 

Bath and body stores such as the Body 
Shop, Bath and Body Works, Crabtree and 
Evelyn - or discount stores such as Ross or 
Marshall's-sell baskets of bath goodies for as 
little as $10. 

Club memberships and magazine and 
newspaper subscriptions nave staying power, 
and arc practical. A bcer-club membership is a 
great monthly treat-the Great American Beer 
Club offers one yearof microbrewed bottles, at

M. ith the holiday season quickly approaching, many students may expe-rience extra stress during the final weeks of the fall qual1er. In addition to the regular 
numbers of students who come to UCSD's 

PsychologicaVCounseling Services seeking either ad-
vice or professional help, as many as four students with 
urgent situations come in each day during this time of 
year. 

However, while this "holiday stress" often comes 
within the context of other problems coinciding with the 
holidays, it is not directly related to the season. 

Thunday, Novembcr30,1995 

a.M'.1.d 

Dominic Lobbla/Guarc1l811 

Such stress is "fairly common," said Clinical Director 
ofPsychologicaVCounselingServices Equilla Luke. These 
situations may include "the end of the quarter, studying, 
finals, having two holidays back-to-back (Thanksgiving 
and Christmas) ... orconcerns about reentering family life 
at that time .... The combination can be quite stressful." 

More serious psychological factors may include dis-
orders which typically occur during or near the holiday 
season, such as seasonal affective disorder or the "holiday 
blues." 

.An.yo:n.e Ca:n. :J:Ie Sa.n.t;& 

Beller know as the "winter blahs, " seasonal affective 
disorder describes the condition when people "feel down 
during the winter season," said Luke. "If you suspect that 
you may have seasonal affective disorder, you should 
definitely see a professional for treatment." 

The holiday blues, however, is"a classic example [of 
mental pressure) .... People can't live up to their fantasy or 
expectation of how the holidays [ought to tum out)," Luke 
added. 

In addition, if one suffers from chronic holiday blues 
- he or she is affected every year - Luke, again, 
strongly recommends seeking professional help. "It may

a ver 15,000 San Diego children have no families with whom to spend the holidays, according to the 
Salvation Army. To combat 

this sad situation, the UCSD Volun-
teer Connection, in conjunction with 
the San Diego chapter of the Salva-
tion Army, is holding its annual Angel 
Tree/Share Bear Holiday Gift Drive. 

Headed by Volunteer Connection 
Director of Special Projects Nicole 
Payne, the program seeks to find vol-
unteers to purchase presents for dis-
advantaged chi Idren. The organiza-
tion displays Christmas trees at vari-

ous locations around campus during 
the final weeks of fall quarter. Dis-
plays are at: Revelle College Center, 
Marshall College Residential Life 
Office, Warren College Student Ac-
tivitiesCenter, Pepper Canyon Apart-
ments Residential Life OffICe, Uni-
versity Events Lobby, Scripps Insti-
tutionofOceanography and, of course, 
the Volunteer Connection. 

Each of the ornaments on the trees 
has two of a child's gift wishes. The 
Volunteer Connection displays a total 
of about 150 ornaments on campus. 
The volunteer who takes an ornament 
should obtain one of the gifts on the 

list and then return both the ornament 
and the gift to the display which origi-

• Get plenty of rat. Students' 
sleeping &lid eating patterns tend 10 
be somewhat abnormal during 6-
naIs. Therefore, resting up during 
the holidays can help to reduce built-
up stress from the quarter. 

• Exercise regularly. Many stu-
dents put off exercising when their 
schedules overflow with stressful &C-
tivities, such as studying for finals. 
However, gettingsomeexercisemay 
actually reduce tension, therefore as-
sisting in combating stressful situa-
tions. 

This time of year has inherent ups 
and downs. To experience more ups 
than downs, students should deal 
with their stress rather than let it 
build up. Organize your time, talk to 
your family and friends and get 
enough sleep and exercise. But most 
importantly, don't let the pressures 
of this time of year get the best of 
you. If you are suffering from holi-
day stress,call a friend or acounselor 
- don't face the upcoming season 
alone.

SENATE: Mail

Continued from pal. 1 
affirmative action and the notion of 
shared governance was necessary. 

"[Mosshsammer'sj motion is like 
witnessing a lynching and prosecut-
ing the perpetrators for littering," 
ethnic studies professor George 
Lipsitz said. "It's a way of avoiding 
the substance of what was done." 

Lipsitz added that 
Mosshammer's resolution overlooks 
the people who will be affected by 
the regents' action. 

"To continue to doubly punish 
these people in the way that the 
regents ' decision will do, corrupts 
the quality and integrity of the uni-
versity," he said. 

Graduate Student Association 
President Steve Dubb agreed that 
taking affirmative action out of the 
resolution was a poor idea. 

"To ski rt aside the issue and not 
take a position at this point would be 
Inappropriate," he said. "Rather than 
put off the discussion, I would ad-
vise you to go back to the original 
motion and have an honest discus-
sion of the issues." 

Literature professor Susan 

Kirkpatrick added that affirmative-
action programs are necessary to-
ward fulfilling the university's mis-
sion. 

"How will we be able to avoid 
becoming an elitist enclave, a very 
' ivory tower,' distant from the reali-
ties of the concerns of the 21st-
century college population in Cali-
fornia?" she said. 

Associate professor of literature 
George Mariscal also emphasized 
that affirmative action was vital to 
the futur~ of the university . 

"There is no magic bullet. There 
is no tool as effective as affirmative 
action towards realizing the mission 
statement of the university as stated 
in the master plan," Mariscal said. 

Although a majority of the as-
sembly supported the original reso-
lution - addressing both affirma-
tive action and the issue of shared 
governance - Academic Senate 
Chair John Wheeler said he wished 
the substitute resolution had been 
more carefully considered. 

" I felt it was unfortunate that 
[Mosshammer'sj motion essentially 
had no one speak in favor of it," 
Wheeler said. "There was a good 
case to be made for st icking to the 
issue of the regents taking seriously 
the opinion of the administration

and the faculty." 
Some present at the meeti ng were 

altogether opposed to the resolu-
tions. 

Psychology professor Hal 
Pashler read a statement prepared 
by 11 faculty members supporting 
the regents' action. 

"The regents' courageous and 
principled decision invites us to re-
ject divisive and unfair notions of 
group rights and address the real 
educational needs of the people of 
California," Pashler said. 

Pashlersuggested expanded out-
reach programs and summer pro-
grams for teachers as possible alter-

natives to affirmative-action pro-
grams. 

"This will make a much more 
positive contribution than approv-
ing a poorly reasoned attack on the 
regents and trying to reinstate a 
policy that is discriminatory, inef-
fective and legally unsustainable," 
he said. 

Physics professor Tom O'Neil 
suggested that one or both resolutions 
be presented to the faculty at large for 
discussion and a mail ballot. 

"We need to have a greater dis-
cussion about the campus ... if we 
are to have any meaningful state-
ment," he said. 

The assembly approved theorigi-
nal, two-part resolution by a 36-15 
vote, then they passed a measure, 
29-22, to forward it to the faculty for 
a mail ballot. If approved by the 
faculty, it will join similar state-
ments by the UC Berkeley, Davis, 
Los Angeles, San Francisco and 
Santa Barbara Academic Senate 
councils. 

"I'm very happy they approved 
the resolution, and I think it's prob-
ably good that it's going to go to the 
entire faculty," Senate Undergradu-
ate Representative David Valentine 
said. "I'm hopeful it will pass there 
as well."

Thursday, November 30, 1995 

Wheeler said that while he was 
happy with the meeting, he was un-
sure about the effect of the mail 
ballot. 

"' I suspect that the campus will 
be rather divided on the issue," he 
said. "I, personally, would have 
rather seen the substitute motion 
pass because I think that's one that 
could have been more widely sup-
ported, but my job as chair is not to 
favor one motion over another." 

Although the main focus of the 
two-hour-Iong meeting was the reso-
lution, I nterim Chancellor Marjorie 
Caserio did speak briefly on the 
1995-96 and 1996-97 UC budgets, 
the search for the next UCSD chan-
cellor, significant increases in un-
dergraduate enrollment and UCSD's 
increasing private support. 

"Even though we've had such a 
hard time budgetwise in the last few 
years ... the campus is just incred-
ibly strong," Caserio said. 

Caserio also stressed the impor-
tance of ethical behavior in higher 
education, citing the current UC 
Irvine reproductive health-center 
scandal. 

"We have fewer ethical standards 
for reproductive technology in hu-
mans than we have for animals," she 
said.

Happy Holidays, CHAMPS: Seniors go out in style 
Continued from pal. 22 

SPORTS IS 

The Tritons did just that, coming 
back in style, to pull out a 2-1 over-
time victory and advanced to the 
Final Four. 

From Santas Sean 
and Dan... Guarc/ian 

sports boys ••. 

It didn ' t look all too promising 
for the team in the playoffs this year. 
Playing in the cold and rain of Min-
nesola, UCSD was scored on by 
Gustavus Adolphus with eight min-
utes to play in overtime. But the 
team remained positive. 

"You looked up and no one was 
down," Muchowski sail!. "No one 
gave up. We just looked at each 
other and said, 'Fuck that, let's go 
and score.' I knew we had the drive 
and the heart to pull it out." 

"We knew we could oome back, " 
Peer said. "Every player out there had 
the same confidence in knowing we 
could score and win the game." 

"From the beginning of the year, 
we looked at each other and felt that 
this could be our year," Peer said. 
" It was an added benefit to have 
nine of the 11 starters back." 

Their desire fueled the 1995 
UCSD women's soccer team to a 
National Championship, which will 
never be forgotten. And we will 
never forget these special seniors.

The Rugburns 
Taking the World by Donkey 

Known best for their stirring live perfor-
IIWICCS, The Rugbums return 10 the studio for a 
second full-length album, Taking the World by 
Donley. Unlike the band's previous 
songs (in particular, "Hitchhiker 
Joej, DonIr.ey - while still riddled 
with deranged lines of verse-does 
not rely heavily upon the use of 
catchy, hook-ridden lyrics. 

On DonIr.ey, the band constantly 
shifts gears, from the punk-like 
"War," which satirizes everything 
from the army to the Ayatollah, to 
"The Ballad of Tommy &. Marla" 
and the rough-hewn "You're So 
Busy." It's hard to say whether the odd pacing is 
the product of poor sequenci ng or a truly dis-

turbed mind. 
The Rugbums' acoustic backgrounds shine 

. through quite often, setting a fairly slow pace 
despite the insertion of upbeat little 
ditties such as "Pile on the Hang-
over," which sounds much like a 
country westem tune until you lis-
ten to the lyrics. At times, Donkey 
seems to drift a bil Perhaps a few 
of the 15 trICO could have been 
whittled out of the album, but 
Donkey is largely entertaining and 
has more than its share of worth-
while~~(~R~)

Alive in America The Sound of Music By Pizzicato Five 

Rolling Stones 
Stripped 

The Japanese pop group, Pizzicato 
Five, consisting of vocalist Maki 
Nomiya and musician Yasuharu 
Konishi, has been creating music since 
1985 which defies any strid defini-
tion. The group hit it big last year in 
the U.S. with its appropriately titled 
album, Made in USA, which received 
airplay at major radia stations across 
the country. 

The Sound of Music by PizzicaJo 
Five marks the newest release from 
the eclectic Tokyo duo. Following the 

melodic rhythms of its previous al-
bums, songs range from the disco-
like, "Sophisticated Catchy," to the 
jazz track, "Number Five." 

"Fortune Cookie," on the other 
hand, has a mellow sound which adds 
to the distinct "lounge" feel of the 
album. 

Perhaps just as interested in style 
as in music, Pizzicato Five both recre-
ates and redefines some familiar mu-
sic genres. (MalOdor Records)

Steely Dan made its name in the 
mid-'70s by combin ing an East Coast 
jazz sensibility with rock's emphasis 
on guitars and tight harmonies. Its 
ability to produce both Top4O hits 
and FM-radiocultfavoritesevencata-
pulted it, for a time, into that era's 
pantheon. 

stripped is the Rolling Stones' 
answer to MTV's Unplugged series, 
completing a process that has taken 
over two decades to get 
right - translating the 
band 's decadent spunk to 
a live record. Get Yer Ya-
YasOut (1970) and Love 
You Live (1 977) featured 
competent arena rock 
standards, with the usual 
sacrificing of vocal har-
monies and other nu-
ances. And by the Steel 
Wheels tour of '89 (high-

the guitar duels of Keith Richards and 
Ron Wood can be more fully appreci-
ated. Mick Jagger's subtle phrasing 

and some great harmonies 
are also gloriously evi-
dent. The crisp strum of 
an acoustic guitar is still 
the purest sound in rock 
- catch "Wild Horses," 
"Angie" or Keith 
Richards' plaintive, "Slip-
ping Away." 

Cyp~ess Hill 
Cypress Hill III: Temples of Boom 

Leaders Donald Fagen and Walter 
Becker eventually dropped theirlour-
ing rock band (and lost some oftheir 
audience) in favor of a constantly 
changing lineup of session players, 
but, at the same time, they made the 
sound of their jazz icons accessible to 
pop audiences. Sure, they became 
jazzy and slick (think Toto with hip-
per chords), but who couldn't stop 
humming those gorgeous melodies? 

For various reasons, Becker and 
Fagen decided to regroup and tour 
again in 1993, 12 years after the 
release of their last album, Gaucho. 
Steely Dan was a band again, and 
Alive inAmerica is a set of its classic 
tunes from the '93 and '94 tours. 
The new group showcases a soar-
ing, three-piece horn section (all 
sa xes) and an emphasis on the pop! 
jazz they captured on their biggest-
sellingalbum,Aja. Even twooftheir 
early rock pieces, "Reelin' in the 
Years" and "Bodhisattva," are 
stripped down and converted here. 
(Giant Records) 

lighted on 1991 's F/ashpoint), the 
Stones had added backup vocalists 
and creeped a little closer to the origi-
nal studio arrangements. But there 
was still a lack of intimacy . 

As its title suggests,Stripped pares 
the band down to the chassis, where 

Even the long-forgot-
ten intro to "Street Fight-
ing Man" is back. Say 

what you will about Keith Richards; 
his guitar still rings as sharp and true 
as ever . 

Still, this may be rock's greatest 
party record since James Brown Live 
at the Apollo. (Virgin Records) 

- Mike Martinez 

On its previous two albums, the 
Los Angeles-based hip-hop group 
Cypress Hill incessantly espouses the 
virtues of smoking weed. On Temples 
of Boom, the band continues to advo-
cate the legalization and appreciation 
of marijuana, but it also pushes politi-
cal issues more overtly than it has in 
the past. 

References to killing cops in 
"Stoned Raiders" and "Locotes" 
stems from frustration rather than 
sensatioflctiism. Even in the party 
anthem, "Throw Your Set in the 
Air," Cypress Hill includes images 
of social strife from its East L.A .

J.J. Castner: The

winner and two-
time all-American 
captured his third 
consecutive 
Regional title in '95 
and placed 12th in 
the National 
Championships. 

•

mentsand team unity. The UCSD 
men 's and women's cross-coun-

It was a year filled with high hopes and great 
expectations, which culminated in a tenth-
place team finish at the NCAA Division III 
National Championships. try teams came out and ran, and 

the results werequite impressive. 
The men 's team was rich in 

experience, as it boasted 10 seniors. Pushing 
each other to do their best daily, they all 
contributed to the overall success of the team. 

Seniors J.J. Castner, Robert Ho, Nate 
Johnson, Goss Lindsey and John Walsh were 
consistently in the top group of racers. Half of 
the entire team, including these stellar com-
petitors, will be graduating this year, leaving 
some some speedy and dedicated shoes for 
next season's group to fill . Robyn 

Henkowltz: A 
team captain, 
Herskowitz was a 
"strong competitor" 
according to her 
coach and came 
back to lead the 
team after taking a 
year off. 

John Wal ... : "He 
definitely tumed up 
the heat this year, " 
Van Arsdale said . 
"He is one of the 
strongest athletes 
in the program and 
a foundation of its 
success; Mr. 

Mav .... : 
"He was our 
financier," Van 
Arsdale said. 
"He was an 
integral part of 
the athletes 
development on 
and off the 
field . " 

Jane 
Zimmerman: 
"This year she 
beat a major 
obstacle when 
she leamed to 
overcome fear 
of failure and 
succeed," Van 

But with a talented group of sophomores 
and freshmen, the future still looks bright. 
Leading the men next year will be returning 
senior Bryan Leek, as well as sophomores 
Gavin Klinger, Neal Harder, Mike Wallace 
and Steve Varnell. 

The women's team will graduate four of 
their runners. Robyn Herskowitz, Michaela 
Monahan, Sarah Wayson and Jane Zimmerman 
will all be moving on to new ventures in life. 
Competing on a fairly young team, this expe-
rienced group of seniors anchored the women 
during this season's competitions. 

L..-______ ---J Consistency." L--__ ......:. ___ -l Arsdale said. 

With 13 athletes returning next season, the 
women will be looking to improve and domi-
nate. The Tritons will have their number-one 
and -two runners (sophomore Kyndra Smith 
and freshman Maggie Dwire), as well as 
number-four runner Courtney Gray set to at-
tack thecoursesonceagain. Add to that a roster 
of up-and-coming sophomores, and UCSD's 
hopes for next season should be high.

:N' o one would argue with the fact that the 
UCSD women's volleyball team had a 
rocky season. The Tritons finished the 

year 15-15 after battling through a series of key injuries. 
But, that record is not indicative of what the team 
accomplished during a season in which so many key 
players spent as much time watching from the bench as 
they did participating on the floor. 

Senior outside hitter Angelle Crochet was one such 
perfonner, whose absence was strongly fell. Crochet, 
however, did as any good athlete and competitor will do, 
when she stepped up to help lead the Tritons in their 
important, late-season games. Despite the nagging inju-
ries, UCSD played solid ball in the playoffs but was 
knocked off by inspired archrival California Lutheran. 

UCSD's season came to a painfully premature end-
ing, but not without a significant peek into the future. 
Freshmen middle blockers Shannon Noonan and Chris-
tine Prowd have great careers ahead, and under the 
tutelage of junior middle blocker Christine Chi, they 
could develop into dominating forces at the nel. 

Chi, who was selected as a first-learn all-American 
will be called upon to step into a leadership roll with th; 
departure of Crochet, whose fiery on<ourt presence 
will be missed. Leadership will also be added by a core 
of juniors that includes leading hitter Micke Biesheuvel. 

"'Chich' will create leadership by example through 
her daily work ethic," Head Coach Doug Danneviksaid. 

With Ihat leadership and the experience of this 
season's NCAAs under the belts of this young squad, 
next season looks promising. 

After winning three 
meets this year, 
Van Arsdale said 
of Lindsey, a 1500 
all-American, "He 
showed 
perserverance, it 
was his best 
season ever." 

An.elle Crochet: "Her hustle and 
respect for the game rubbed off on the 
team. She'll be tremendously missed," 
Dannevik said. 

" I hope that losing in the regional round will 
motivate the kids to play at a higher level next year," 
Dannevik said. "We proved to ourselves Ivs. Califor-
nia Lutheran] that we can play with the spirit and heart 
necessary towin. We haveall the ingred ients, and now 
J think we can 't wait to go out [and do it]."

Tritons Run Over Bulldogs 
ROAD KILL: UCSD crushed Redlands, 74-62, on the road Tuesday 
By Robin KezlrI.n 
Stsff Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team members knew they had their 
work cut out for them in a show-

down against the 
University of 
Redlands on Bulldog 
turf. 

The hoopsters 
from Redlands have 
proven themselves to 
be fierce competitors 
in he past, but the 

Tritons dominated both sides of the 
ball to take the victory, 74-62, on 
Tuesday night. 

UCSD 's offense was unstop-
pable in the first half, shooting an 
amazing 57.1 percent from the field 
and oUlscoring the Bulldogs 46-32. 
"We 've been in an offensive click 
since the first game," Head Coach 
Judy Malonesaid. "We havea lotof 
people who can score." 

Sharp-shooting gu ard Cindy 
Yamasaki led the Tritons with 20 
points, including 3 of 8 from three

HOOGER Basich 150 

point range. "Cindy had a great 
game," Malone said. "She hit early 
from outside and drove inside." 

Yamasaki also successfully 
dished the ball off for five scores 
and sunk three free-throws in her 34 
minutes on the court. 

Junior forward Karli Jungwirth 
continued to post good numbers for 
the Tritons, finishing with 16 points 
and 8 rebounds; while forward Anne 
Westmoreland rounded out the Tri-
ton attack, scoring in double-digits 
with 14 points and 6 rebounds. 

Jungwirth capitalized on numer-
ous Redlands fouls, tallying six 
points in seven trips to the charity 
stripe. Lead by Jungwirth 's impres-
sive 87.5 percent, the entire UCSD 
squad seems to be improving at the 
free-throw line this year. 

The Bulldogs kept it close in the 
second half by stepping-up on de-
fense and taking more chances on 
the court. Although the Tritons com-
mitted more turnovers and their 
shooting percentage plummeted to 
24.1 percent, coach Malone was not

disappointed with her squad's 
second-half performance. 

'' It was a good learning half 
for us," Malone said. "It's hard 
to maintain intensity when you 're 
up by 20 points." 

The next task at hand for the 
UCSD women is to maintain their 
physical condition and intensity, 
while the rest of us enjoy winter 
break. Although tbey ' lI continue 
to practice and train to maintain 
their quickness and defensive 
advantage, the Tritons' will bave 
a short break in their schedule 
after a match-up against Pomona 
this Saturday. 

"The break is kind of nice for 
us," Malone admitted. " It gives 
us a cbance for any wounds to 
heal. Everybody is really moti-
vated to stay in shape." 

The UCSD women will re-
turn to action as hosts of the UC 
San Diego (nvitational on Dec. 
28-30, a competition which con-
sists of five teams that reached 
the NCAA tournarilentlast year.

"I'm going to miss them all, big-
time," Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. "When you've got 
players that come in, start as fresh-
men, play for four years and sud-
denly take them out of the team, 
you're losing the backbone of the 
team." 

The leaders of the outgoing se-
niors would have 10 be Johnson, 
Muchowski, Peer and Pugh - all of

the past four years. 

Johnson, the dribbling demon of

her area superbl y and was the cata-
lyst for many of her fellow players' 
successes.

Tritons' success this year was full-
back Chilton. His strong play from 
the left side set up many goals. The 
leading scorer a year ago, "Chili" 
contributed four goals and an assist 
this year. 

Terlecky helped Chilton at the 
defensive end, while making his 
customary runs from the midfield 
position to set up teammates. 

"We had an up-and-down year," 
Terlecky said. "[Coach Derek 
Armstrong] is a good motivator and 
he got me going, but our chemistry 
wasn ·tthere. lthink what separated us 
in '93 was altitude. We were hungry, 
and we played with intensity." 

ror all they have done, these 
seniors will leave a huge gap in the 
soccer depar!ment and in our hearts.

McManus said. 

"Coming to UCSD was the best 
decis ion I could have made ," 
Johnson said. "We just decided as a 
team to go for it this year, and we 
made it. I still can't believe it." 

Muchowski, this year'ssweeper, 
played all sorts of positions in her 
career, ranging from striker to stop-
per. 

" I don't know what I'd do with-
out soccer," Muchowski said. "The 
camaraderie on our team this year 
was somethingspeciaJ.1t was agreat 
experience. " 

Pugh, a four-yearstarterwhowas 
known as "wheels" for her blister-
ing speed, shared the same senti-
ments. 

"We just love to play soccer," 
Pugh said. "The [disappointment of 
previous years] was on the back of 
our minds, but we came through in 
the end," she said.

Jennifer Ewert: .. She 
was our most dedicated 
player. If it weren't for 
the knee injuries she 
suffered, she could have 
been one of the best

has the ability to strike 
the ball real well," 
McManus said. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Amanda Johnson: .. A 
four-year starter and one 
of the most commanding 
center-midfielders I ever

and improved her

skills, " McManus said. 

Throughout their careers at UCSD, Jennifer Ewert, 
Amanda Johnson, Diana Muchowski, Carrie Peer and 
Carin Pugh have enjoyed the spoils of victory. They 
competed in the Final Four during each of their four years 
of competition at UCSD, and achieved the ultimate goal 
this season by capturing the National Championship. . 

c.rrte P .. r: "One of 
the best offensive 
minded midfielders I 
ever had, " McManus 
said, "Even though she 
played in the midfield 
she probably played 
most of the game in the 
other team 's 18-yard 
box. " 

In a program rich with tradition, these athletes exhib-
ited the kind of leadership only found in the truly great 
players, leaving behind an impressive mark in UCSD 
soccer history. They contributed to an amazing 19-2 
record this season, including a dramatic 2-1 ov<:rtime 
playoff victory, which propelled them to their destiny -
a national title. 

II of the seniors 
leaving the Tri-

ton men 's 
soccer team 

are taking something special with 
them. Each player played a major 
role in the team 's national title 
back in 1993, and their names are 
written in stone as the 1993 Na-
tional Champions. 

Even though this season did 
not end with the same result, these 
five players leave behind a legacy 
of great soccer. 

Starting for most of their ca-
reers, Ken Burns, Matt Chilton, K. 
Ch.ristopher Fujii, Nick Terlecky 

and Erik Waldman will be missed. 
Each player has been a big part of 
Triton soccer success since 1992. 
These five players have contrib-
uted to an astounding 36-13-5 
record since 1993. 

The 1995 season was a bit dis-
appointing compared to previous 
years. Finishing the year with an 
eight-game unbeaten streak, 
UCSD (13-5-2) marched into the 
playoffs, only to exit in the Re-
gional finals with a heartbreaking, 
1-0 loss to Chapman University. 

One of the team's offensive 
weapons has been the play of for-
ward Fujii. 

K. Christopher FuJII: 
(left) a sparkplug off 
the bench this year, 
Fujii is well-known for 
his game-winning goal 
in the 1993 National 
Championship game. 
He is also known for 
his dancing and is 
often spotted 
practicing his moves 
following a goal. 

See CHAMPS, Page 22 

S~o:rie.by

" It was disappointing to lose at 
home in the playoffs," Fujii said. 
"We always play well at home, but 
it didn 't happen this year. I'm lucky 
to have been on both the '91 and 
'93 National Champion teams, and 
I will never forget that." 

Fujii'scompanionatforwardwas 
Waldman. He had his best year per-
sonally, scoring a team-high eight 
goals, but he would have preferred a 
longer playoff run.

turned out like '93," Waldman 
said. "That year was unforgettable.

Diana Muchowskl: "[She] was probably one 
of the best all-around plyers ever at UCSD. 
She could've easily played forward but she 
solified the back at sweeper," McManus said

to the senior athletes who 

have played their f inal' game 
in a Triton uniform. 

Ken Bums: (right) The 
backbone of the Triton 
defense, Bums has 
played sweeper all 
four of his years at 
UCSD, and he could 
be counted on to clear 
out dangerous balls. 

Matt Chilton: An offenslve-mlnded fullback, "Chil i" led the 
team in scoring in the 1994 season. This ear, he 
contributed solid play from the left side, sparking numerous 
offensive chances. A force to be reckoned with in the air.
