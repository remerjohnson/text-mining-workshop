Concert Kicks Off Series 
Maw Ethno-techno band Lost at Last perfonns at the first 
TGIF concert of the year put on by the A.S. Council 
By MATT SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

. Despite high attendance expectations and 
.~ history of playing to sold-out arenas, Lost at 
Last performed Friday night in the Price 
Center Plaza to a consistent crowd of approx-
imately 100. 

The Maui-based band, which dedicates its 
shows to a resolution for the problems exist-
ing between Israelis and Arabs, was brought 
to campus by the A.S. Council as part of the 
school's "Thank Goodness It's Friday" con-
cert series. 

"I thought they were awesome: said·A.S. 
Programmer Cassie Williams. "They definite-
ly have a lot of skilL" 

. 

Though many in attendance had not pre-
viously heard of the band, most were satisfied 
yet surprised by the concert. 

"I think they were pretty good, with a nice 
beat: third-year medical student Bret 
Neiderman said. "I thought it was a bit under-

.populated, though. I thought it would be a lot 
more crowded for what it was." 

Williams attributes the small turnout to 
the lack of interest UCSD students have 
when it comes to new bands. 

"People want to see what they already 
know," Williams said. "They are not going to 

'come, regardless if what I bring in is quali-

Coptic Club 
Invites Bishop to 
First Meeting 
New organization is 
modeled after VCl club 
By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Staff Writer 

The recently formed Coptic Club, an orga-
nization that promotes Coptic Orthodoxy, held 
its first meeting Thursday in the Price 
Center. The club welcomed H.G. Bishop 
Serapion, bishop of Southern California and 
Hawaii, as a guest speaker. 

According to freshman Ramsey Marcus, 
UCSD students formed the club aft er wit-
nessing the Coptic Club's success at UC 
Irvine. 

"It was so strong at UC I, we knew we 
could bring the club here and get it that big 
as well," Marcus said. "It 's good to see the 
support we have so far from the. first meet-
ing." 

Several months ago, fourth-year UCSD stu-
dent Bishoy Said attended a Los Angeles meet-
ing where he saw Serapion speak at an 
American Orthodox church. . 

Three weeks ago, Said met with the bishop 
to arrange fo r him to speak. to the UCSD 
Coptic Club. Serapion was enthusiastic about 
orating for the club, according to Said. 

"He was very encouraging and happy to be 
our guest," Said said. "He has devoted his life 
to teaching about this, and it is an honor to 
have him come all 'the way from L.A. '" 

The purpose of the club is to educate and p 
romote knowledge of the Coptic religion . Ther 
e is a small Coptic church in Solana Beach, and 
the members of the Coptic Club hope the club 
can be another venue in which Coptics ca n cel 
ebrate their religion. 

Community members and s~udel1ts from 
other schools attended the meeting, suggesting 
that the club can serve as a bridge to connect 
with people interested in the religion outside 
campus. • 

Club members sang a traditional hymn as 
Serapion arrived at the meeting in a custom-
ary black robe. He then led the room in 
prayer and gave a 45-minute-long overview 
of the religion, involving the members in his

Bookstore Steps Up as Web Site Goes Under 
UCSD book seller fills problematic orders after BigWords,Com's unexpected demise 
By KYLE 8IIBU IIIIMI R 
Contributing News Writer 

Online textbook retailer 
Big\Vords filled its last order and 
"succumbed ... to the powers that 
be," according to an explanation 
posted on its Web site on Oct. 20. 

Like many other online retail-
ers, BigWords has encountered 
financial difficulties that have 
ground its operations to a halt. 

The announcement makes mat-
ters difficult for college students 
across the nation, including UCSD 
students. Students who wish to 
return their textbooks or request a 
refund dirroIy from BigWords will 
be unable to do so, given the com-

pany's untimely. failure. 
The UCSD Bookstore is offer-

ing a solution to students. John 
Turk, UCSD Bookstore directQf, 
has decid~d that the BOQ,k$torc 
will ' accept receipts f!'om 
BigWords and .honor book 
returns as if they were from the 
Bookstore. 

"We feel it fills our mission to 
be of service for the academic 
community, . particularly the stu-
dents, who are caught in the mid-
dle by circumstances beyond their 
control," said David Wilson, 
course materials manager. "It's 
purely a service mission on our 
part." 

The bookstore's new policy is 

designed to help students who 
purchased textbooks for the fa II 
quarter from BigWords and later 
dropped the class or wished to 
return their books. 

Students who would not have 
been able to obtain a refund for 
their BigWords books can return 
them to the Bookstore for full cred-
it. "It's not a give-away, exactly: 
Wilson said. "We do get the book. 
We're just giving (students] 
credit. It's not as if we're saying, 
'Whatever loss you suffered from 
BigWords, we'll cover,'" 

It is difficult to speculate how 
many UCSD students have been 
affected by BigWords' closure, and 
how many will take advantage of 

the Bookstore's offer. 
"I hesitate to say whether it will 

be half a dozen or 20: Wilson 
said. "It's not just the number of 
students who ordered books from 
BigWords - it's only the ones 
who had a problem and did not 
get it resolved." 

Students with a BigWords text-
book they wish to return should 
bring it and its original receipt to 
the customer service area of the 
UCSD Bookstore by ov. 11. The 
book must be in mint condition 
for a full credit. Otherwise, a 75 
percent credit will be issued. 

For more information, please 
contact David Wilson at (858) 
534-3771 .

However, some students believed 
that the unexpectedly small atten-
dance was more a problem stemming 
from the school itself. 

"This school has no school spir-
it," Warren Senior Austin Kennedy 
said. "The students have to get 
involved." 

Kennedy also said the little public-
ity he saw for the show must have 
been a factor in the diminutivt: crowd 
size. 

"I haven't seen any flyers at all; 
he said. "It sucks for kids who like 
this music and didn't get to go 
because they didn't know about it. 
The school needs to be promoting 
stuff like this." . 

Williams was surprised and disap-
pointed by this allegation. 

The programming office stated 
that it put up flyers all throughout

Coptic: 
Serapilm described fasts 
cammon to the religion 
Continued from paC. 1 
lecture as he asked questions 
throughout. 

. An Egyptian branch of Orthodox 
Christianity, the Coptic Church has 
been in existence for about 2,000 
years, forming in A.D. 45 in 
Alexandria. It is based on the teach-
ings of St. Mark, who brought 
Christianity to Egypt during the reign 
of the Roman emperor Nero in the 
first century. 

Now an independent church, the 
Coptic religion exists all over the 
world, according ro .Serapion. The 
persecution it has survived only 
strengthens the deep spirituality of 
the church, he said. 

"This is a church of ideology and s 
pirituality that separates human natur 
e from divine nature," Serapion said. " 
The spiritual life is a life of joy." 

A t the meeti ng, . Serapion 
described the significance of the fasts 
that church members keep. 
According to Serapion, the Coptic 
Church has been described as the 
"fasting church; as fasts occur 
Wednesday and Friday to remember 
the days of the week when Judas 
turned Jesus Christ over to the Jews 
and when he was crucified. T.here are 
also 14 occasions throughout the yea r 
when the church fasts to recognize 
religious holidays. 

"After the fasting, we can join each 
other in celebration in the feasts; Scr 

apion said. 
Serapion also referred to the Bible 

and mentioned its imponance. 
"How the church lives the Bible he 

Ips us to understand our life and what 
it contains; Serapion said. "Everythi 

ng the church says must be support-
ed by the Bible." 

The speech ended with a ques-
tion-and-answer period. Sera pion 
then led the group in prayer. He 
consecrated bread, which was dis-
tributed to members. 

The club presented him with a 
UCSD coffee mug in appreciation 
for his presence. 

Serapion wished to visit with the 
members in a less formal atmos-
phere, so the Coptic Club arranged a 
dinner for members following the 
meeting, during which they could 
talk to the bishop personally. 

"It was great to have him speak 
here; Said said . "You get a feel for 
what the peace of the Coptic Church 
really is. 

"The true heart of it is in the 
monastery, though; he added. 

Said visited a Coptic monastery 
last summer and described the expe-
rience as very serene and spiritual. 

The Coptic Club will post infor-
mation and will continue to meet 
every week on Thursdays at 5 p.m. 
in the Price Center Gallery A.

UCSD Scientists Awarded $3 
MIllion IBlocomplexlty' Grant 

The National Science Foundation has award-
ed physicists and biologists at UCSD a $3 mil-
lion grant to study the development of the ame-
boid protozoan Dictyostelium discoideum, an 
organism commonly known as slime mold. 

The grant is being awarded for five years and 
was one of 16 grants awarded by the foundation 
th IS month to study the effects of the interaction 
between living things on all levels with their 
environment. 

UCSD scientists will collaboratt; with 

researchers at Cornell University to attempt to 
connect the underlying genetic information 
about slime mold to its morphology and multi-
cellular organization. 

The scientists said they chose slime mold 
because it is the simplest organism to study for 
their purposes.

4 OPINION 

For the position of Presi-dent of the United States, the Guardian editorial board endorses Texas governor and Republican 
presidential candidate George W. 
Bush. This endorsement meant 
different things to different editori-
al board members, with some 
asserting an affinity for Bush's 
plans and record, while others put 
forth their endorsement strictly as 
a vote for the lesser of two evils. 

The jewel in the crown of 
Bush's record in Texas is his histo-
ry of reforming defunct school sys-
tems and the equitable way in 
which he has made these changes. 
When Bush took office in Texas, 
children in his state ranked close to 
the bottom in every educational 
category, including being rated 51st 
in the nation, behind Puerto Rico, 
in many. Since his election, Texas 
students have made greater strides 
in reading and mathematics than 
any other state in the nation . 

Bush's plan for the country's 
education reform includes giving 
public schools a finite ' amount of 
time to ' make strides toward 
improvement. If schools do not 
show this improvement in a certain 
period of time, the parents of the 
children who go to these schools 

The UCSD Guardian 

PINION 

--

--"-

will be given the option to send 
their children to another public 
school. Bush also wants to move 
education control to a local level to 
avoid bureaucracy. Unlike Gore, 
Bush gives the school districts the 
power to decide what to spend 
their funds on. Gore uses a formu-
la that, in our opinion, is too inflex-
ible to be effective. 

Perhaps the most impressive part 
of Texas' educational reform under 
Bush is the manner in which it has 

u~ne those reforms. Improve-
ment in reading and mathematics 
has keyed Texas' overall improve-
ment, with African-American and 
Hispanic children showing the 
biggest improvements. These 
improvements to minority education 
levels show the importance . Bush 
puts on equality, something that 
most members of his party do not, 
and something that the GIUII'dian 
feels is of utmost importance. 

The GUlJTdian also feels that 
Bush's tax plan is one of great fore-
thought. He calls for a tax cut 
across the board, putting more 
money back into the pockets of the 
people and bolstering consumer 
spending. His plan does not 
"squander" the surplus, as some 
allege. Rather, he plans to retum 
one-quarter of the surplus to the 

taxpayers that earned it. 
Although Gore has attacked 

Bush for allegedly planning tax 
cuts for the richest Americans, fur-
ther inspection of the Bush tax 
plan shows that the rich receive the 
smallest percentage cut, while the 
majority of the cut goes to the 
poorest Americans. About six mil-
lion of America's poorest families 
will have their taxes completely 
alleviated under Bush's plan. 

Tax cuts of this nature have his-
torically been shown to kick off 
economic booms, with Lyndon B. 
Johnson's original 30 percent tax 
cut standing out above the others. 
Many point to President Ronald 
Reagan's tax cuts and the deficit 
they allegedly caused. On the con-
trary, Reagan's cuts did not cause 
the deficit; his exorbitant defense 
spending, something that Bush 
does not endorse, caused it. 

One thing that seems to sepa-
rate Bush from the other members 
of the Republican party, a group 
whose candidates rarely get the 
endorsements of news publica-
tions, is his desire to make Wash-
ington a bipartisan place. Current-
ly, partisan politics dominate leg-
islative action, frustrating Ameri-
cans to the point of exhaustion. In 
Texas, Bush worked with Democ-

rats to institute tax cuts and over-
haul the defunct Texas education-
al system. We are not naive 
enough to believe that he can be 
as successful at breaking down 
party lines in Washington as he 
was in Austin, but any attempt to 
destroy the.se seemingly inde-
structible barriers would be good 
for Americans. 

Although Ralph Nader, the 
Green Party's presidential nomi-
nee, brings a breath of fresh air to 
this campaign, the Guardian feels 
that he is a one-dimensional candi-
date lacking expertise broad 
enough to run the most powerful 
nation in the world. We could not 
endorse Nader for the post of pres- ' 
ident in good faith. 

Gore is the other major choice 
in this election. He has been a pro-
ponent of the environment Since 
his time in Congress. so if the 
health of the environment is of pri-
mary concern, looking funher into 
Gore's credentials would be war-
ranted. However, the Guardian feels' 
that his strong environmental 
record does not come close to 
making up for his shortcomings. 

Gore will say anything and 
everything he can to try to sway the 
vote in his direction. From the wtll-
publicized "I invented the Internet" 

Monday, November'6, 2000 

quote to a claim that he did not 
know that a trip to a Buddhist tem-
ple was a fund-raiser, Gore has lied 
throughout the campaign in order 
to attempt to win votes. 

The Guardian believes it is time 
for this deception to come to an 
end. Perhaps it is naive to . believe 
that Bush will be any more honest 
or uphold the integrity of the office 
of president. It is impossible to 
know how Bush will react if he is 
voted into office, but the Guardian 
editorial board believes that this 
chance is one worth taking. 

The post of president of the 
United States was never intended 
to be so glorious and powerful that 
people would say or do anything to 
get there. It was intended to be a 
representative post of the thoughts 
and beliefs of the American people. 
Georgt Washington was elected 
not because he fied to mix up the 
issues at hand, but because the 
people believed him to be the best 
man for the job. 

Gore wants to be ptUident too 
badly. In the process of striving for 
it he has alienated the people 
whom he is relyina on. This was 
the primary reason the Guardian 
was unable to support the vice 
president, and instead supports his 
opponent. Gcorgt W. Bush.

United States 
SENATE 

Tom Campbell 

, ELECTION ( , 

California's students in the 
worst-performing schools to 
attend nondiscriminating private 
schools. He is also in favor of the 
expansion of California's charter 
school system. 

In contrast with Feinstein, 
Campbell has taken great care in 
spending taxpayers' money. 

The UCSD Guardian 

every time it has come up in 
Congress, no matter which 
party happened to be in con-
trol. 

Campbell wants drastic 
reform 'of the ' bloated, unfair 
and loophole-laden income tax 
system. 

OPINION 5 

The Guardian endorses Rep. Tom Campbell for the U.S. Senate. Com-pleting his term in the 
House as a representative of 
California's traditionally mod-
erate Silicon Valley, Campbell is 
a socially liberal, fiscally con-
servative Republican who is not 
afraid to buck the party line. 

Campbell, like his opponent 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, is a com-
mitted advocate for women. He 
completed his doctoral disserta-
tion at the University of Chicago, 
writing on how women eam less 
than men in the federal govern-
ment, and he served on the 
White House Task Force on 
Women. 

In the most recent ratings by 
the Citizens Against Govern-
ment Waste, Campbell was 
awarded the status "Taxpayer 
Hero," its highest category. The 
same organization rated Fein-
stein as "Taxpayer Hostile," its 
lowest category. 

The National Taxpayers' 
Union rated Campbell the 
member of Congress least will-
ing to spend taxpayers' money 
in 1992, 1997 and 1999. Last 
year, Feinstein was No.2 in the 
Senate in willingness to spend 
money. 

He recommends immediate-
ly cutting the capital gains tax 
in half. By nature, the capital 
gains tax discourages the sel~­
ing of assets that have apprecI-
ated in value such as homes, 
real estate and stock. Histori-
cally, every capital gains tax cut 
has resulted 10 increased eco-
nomic activity that has more 
than paid for the cost of the tax 
cut itself. 

Campbell voted to repeal the 
unfair marriage penalty and 
death tax. He supports perma-
nent research and development 
tax credits that allow compa-
nies to write off a certain 
amount of their research and 
development expenditures. 
This gives American companies 
incentive td continue to devel-
op new technologies that will 
keep the United States at the 
forefront of innovation, keep-
ing our economy rolling in the 
future.

Campbell supports an

tution mandating that the feder-
al govertlment maintain a bal-
anced budget. 

November 8, 11:30 A.M.-1:30 P.M. 
Campbell advocates abortion 

rights. He firmly supports the 
Rut v." Wadt decision and opposes 
its reversal in the Supreme Court 
or by means of a constitutional 
amendment. 

During her 1992 Senate cam-
paign, Feinstein promised she 
would vote for a balanced-bud-
get amendment - and did, 
when Democrats controlled the 
Senate and the amendment had 
no chance of passage. 

The GUlJTdian feels that 
Campbell is the kind of 
thoughtful, no-nonsense repre-
sentation California deserves in 
the Senate.

Campbell also has always 
been a supporter of clean air and 
water. He voted to protect the 
Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, opposes oil exploration 
and drilling off California's 
coast, and was ranked No. 1 in 
Congress by Green Scissors for 
cuning the budget in ways that 
helped the environment. He 
supports research of cleaner 
burning fuels and less depen-' 
dence on crude oil. 

Campbell is for local control 
of education and for giving 
vouchers to the 10 percent of 

When Republicans took 
over in 1995, Feinstein 
switched her vote on the 
amendment, claiming it needed 
language to "protect Social 
Security; even though the ver-
sion for which she had previ-
ously voted had no such lan-
guage. 

Campbell opposes partisan-
ship and has voted for a bal-
anced-budget amendment 

Although Feinstein has long 
been an admirable fighter for 
women, her wildly exorbitant 
spending tendencies and parti-
san behavior, and Campbell's 
own commitment to women, 
make Campbell, in the opinion 
of the Guardian, the correct 
choice.

6 OPINION 

Susan Davis 
( ali fornia State Assemblywoman Susan Davis is the 

Democratic chal-
lenger to incumbent Republi-
can Brian Bilbray in the race for 
the 49th Congressional Dis-
trict, which surrounds the 
UCSD campus, 

The contest between these 
candidates is being closely 
watched by both parties, as BiI-
bray'S last Democratic chal-
lenger, Christine Kehoe, lost by a 
narrow margin in 1998, earning 
46.6 percent to Bilbray's 48.8 
percent. 

The 49th's swing-district 
status is further confirmed by 
the fact that it encompasses 
voters with a wide array of 
political ideologies - its bor-
ders encompass everywhere 
from traditionally conservative 
areas such as La Jolla and Coro-
nado to traditionally liberal 
cities like Pacific Beach and 
Imperial Beach. . 

This year. our diverse district 
deserves the change it so clearly 
indicated it was ready for in the 
Kehoe-Bilbray election of 1998. 
Davis' refreshing, informed and 
well-balanced opinions on the 
main issues prove that she 
would serve as an outstanding 
representative of this multifari-
ous district. 

It is Davis' legislative record 
in the state Assembly that 
proves her unwavering dedica-
tion to improvements in educa-
tion. She has authored legisla-
tion to decrease eighth grade 
class sizes to 20 students and to 
raise minimum standards for 
retaining teachers. Further-
more, she was named 1999 
Legislator of the Year by the 
League of Middle Schools and 
has twice been honored as Leg-
islator of the Year by the Cali-
fornia School Boards Associa-
tion. 

On health care, Davis again 

lias an intensely attractive 
record. For example, she 
authored a bill - which then-
Gov. Pete Wilson signed into 
law - that allows women to 
access obstetridgynecological 
care without first having to 
attain approval from gatekeep-
ers. Her bill was the only piece 
of health care legislation that 
Wilson signed into law while in 
office. In addition, Davis' bills 
have supported patients' rights 
to privacy and the right to 
obtaining a second opinion. 
Equally important in this elec-
tion is Davis' consistent sup-
port for abortion rights. 

Davis' stance on crime also 
shines. For example, she sup-
pons programs such as the 
Community Oriented Policing 
program, which is designed to 
help put more police officers on 
the nation's streets. She also 
participated in securing funding 
for after-school programs that 
target juvenile violence. Addi-
tionally, Davis suppons hate 
crimes legislation. 

Regarding environmental 
concerns, which some tout as 
an issue on which Bilbray can-
not go wrong, Davis is a serious 
candidate, UII biased by special 
interests. She received a 100 
percent approval rating from 
the League of Conservation 
Voters and was named a "Friend 
of the Environment" by the 
Sierra Club. 

By and far, Davis has proven 
her ability to lead the changing, 
growing populations of the 
49th Congressional District 
while serving in the state 
assembly. For her outstanding 
and impressive record on edu-
cation, health care, and other 
key issues, the Guardian endors-
es Davis and encourages voters 
to pay close attention to her 
exciting campaign in the clos-
ing days of the race for the 
49th.

S-

Brian Bilbray 
R ep. Brian Bilbray is a native San Diegan and cites his top priorities as being the protection 
of health care, social security 
and education. He is known for 
direct action when the situation 
calls for it. He is deserving of re-
election to the House of Repre-
sentatives for his service to the 
49th District which includes La 
Jolla, Clairemont, Mission 
Beach and Pacific Beach. 

Bilbray is a major proponent 
of environmental issues and his 
hands-on approach' has yielded 
legislative successes such as the 
B.E.A.C.H. Bill. This bill 
requires uniform national stan-
dards for ocean water quality 
and was passed unanimously by 
the House of Representatives. 

Another of his successes is 
the Border Smog Reduction 
Act. which requires foreign 
commuter vehicles to meet 
higher standards of clean emis-
sions. He strongly supports the 
Conservation and Reinvest-
ment Act, which will provide 
federal matching funds for con-
servation and preservation of 
open space. 

In addition, Bilbray intro-
duced the reVolutionary Grind-
work Mitigation and Commuter 
Stability Act of 2000. This act 
allows employers to ofl'tr sched-
uled "flex time: in which 
employees could work off-peak 
hours, thus cutting down on 
traffic and air pollution. 

In his time in die House of 
Representatives, Bilbray has 
also garnered the extension of 
Medicare's life expectancy by 
10 years by curbing fraud and 
allowing per-person Medicare 
spending to increase by 6.8 
percent. 

He saved California taxpay-
ers over $400 million by holding 
the federal government 
accountable for hospital bills 
racked up by undocumented 

immigrants in California. He 
also served on the joint commit-
tee that deliberated the Safe 
Water Act Amendments of 
1996. Most recently he has 
asserted a strong stance against 
taxation on Internet service 
providers by authoring the 
Internet Non-Discrimination 
Act, the Internet Access Charxe 
Prohibition Act, "E-Sign: the 
Electronic Signatures in Global 
and National Commerce Act, 
and the Unsolicited Electronic 
Mail Act to cut down on 
"spam." 

Bilbray is adamantly trying 
to ease the tax burdens 
imposed on all Americans. He 
authored the Senior Citizen 
Freedom to Work Act of 2000 
to allow senior citizens to con-
tinue working beyond retire-
ment age without losing any 
social security benefits. He 
wrote the Marriage Relief Act 
of 2000 to ease the financial 
burden of the Marriage Penalty 
Tax and he also authored the 
Death Tax Elimination Act, 
which eliminates the death tax. 

Bilbray strongly suppons a 
woman's right to choose but is 
concerned with procedures 
such as panial-binh abortion. 
He is working on legislation 
that will clearly define the 
point at which a fetus has sep-
arate rights from those of its 
mother. He also voted against 
banning gay adoption and for 
ending race-based preferential 
treatment in college admis-
sions. 

Bilbray is supported by the 
California College Republi-
cans, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, and Citizens for 
Law and Order among others. 
The Guardian believes Bilbray 
is the best choice for 49th Dis-
trict representative because he 
obviously cares about the qual-
ity of San Diegans' lives and 
the future of the environment.

PROPOSTITIONS 

Veterans' Bond 
PROP 32 

Vote Yes 

The Guardian endorses Proposi-
tion 32, the Veterans' Bond Act of 
2000. Sponsored by Gov. Gray 
Davis, the bond act would approve 
$500 million in low-cost, low-
interest home and farm loans for 
Californian veterans. The loans are 
aimed at California'S Vietnam vet-
eran population . 

Despite recent criticism of Cal-
ifornia's Department of Veterans 
Affairs by two state watchdogs 
which stated that the department is 
grossly inefficient and is not offer-
ing attractive loan programs, the 
Guardian believes recent major' 
reforms to the depanment are 
moving it in the right direction. 

Supporters say the program is 
self-s.ufficient, with bonds being 
solely funded by the vets them-
selves with their mortgage pay-
ments. Without the passage of the 
bond issue, Cal-Vet loan programs 
will run out of funding by 2002. 

The Guardian fee ls we owe it to 
our veterans to compensate them 
for interrupting the ir lives and 
risking life and limb for their coun-
try. All too often, veterans of war 
have a difficult time readj usting 
after war, and they deserve all the 
help they can get. 

With low- interest loans with 
low down payments, more of them 
will be able to afford homes, and 
many would be able to afford bet-
ter homes in safer neighborhoods. 

With the armed forces increas-
ingly struggling to meet recruit-
ment goals, it does not help to see 
war veterans and their families liv-
ing in unsafe neighborhoods, 
unable to afford homes. Therefore, 
the Guardian believes it is essential 
for morale and recruitment num-
bers that we treat our veterans like 
the heroes they are, and help them 
to improve their lives and the lives 
of their families. 

Legislative Retirement 
PROP 33 

Vote Yes 

The Guardian endorses Proposi-
tion 33, which would allow mem-
bers of the state legislature to receive 
the same retirement benefits as part 
of the Public Employees Retirement 
System as any other state employee. 
without any additional perks. If 
passed, the proposition would pro-
vide incentive for ordinary citizens 
to serve in the legislature. 

Proposition 33 would also 
reverse aspects of Proposition 140, 
passed by California voters in 1990, 
to discourage career politicians. 
Proposition 140 enacted term lim-
its of six years in the Assembly and 
eight years in the Senate, and also 
excluded members from receiving 
pension through PERS. 

Legislature members should 
receive the same benefits as other 
state employees. Retirement bene-
fits should not be considered a 
"perk;" they should be considered 
a privilege that every state worker 
has the right to take advantage of. 

Opponents of Proposition 33 
argue that legislative members 

.' receive $99,000 salaries and should 
invest in a 401 K on their own 
instead of receiving what opponents 
feel to be underserved benefits. 

Although Assembly members 
serve only six years, they may serve 
up to 14 if they also serve in the 
Senate. This is a lon~ time to go 
without accruing baSIC retirement 
benefits. 

Monday, November 6, 2000 

Propositions: 
Continued from page 6 

Through the plan , legisla-
'ture members would get bene-
fits according to standard pro-
cedure. They may opt to set 
aside up to 5 percent of their 
paycheck. I f the investment 
portfoJ.io does well. members 
will receive interest. If it stays 
the same, the member's 5 per-

. cent will be matched . 
The costs to the state are rel-

atively low, expected to weigh in 
at just $1 million. The measure 
would also eliminate the $121 
members receive per day to .cover 
personal expenses, which add up 
to approximately $25,000 in tax-
free money per year. 

Giving members of the legis-
lature a pension instead of play 
money is a more sound approach 
to taking care of their financial 
needs. -

In addition, a vote against 
Proposition 33 will most likely 
mean that few but the rich will 
b'e able to hold a job in the legis-
lature. Most members are part of 
a retirement plan with their 
existing job before they come to 
serve on the legislature and m u~t 
forfeit up to 14 years of·benefits. 

LOCAL ELECTIONS 

San Diego 
MAYOR 

Dick Murphy 
The Guardian endorses Judge 

Dick Murphy for San Diego mayor. 
His environmental record. plans 
fQr traffic management .and overall 
vision for San Diego makes him the 
most qualified candidate. 

He has laid out a specific traffic 
plan combining wider freeways with 
an expanded mass transit system. 

Murphy's opponent, County 
Supervisor Ron Roberts. has ideas 
similar to Murphy's. However, he is 
a career politician, and we feel San 
Diego needs someone with a clear 
vision for San Diego that extends 
beyond the next electiol!. 

California State 
SENATE 

Dede Alpert 
The Guardian believes State Sen. 

Dede Alpen, a proponent of educa-
tion and transportation solutions 
while in the State Senate, deserves 
to be re-elected. 

As senator, Alpert has helped to 
develop a new Master Plan of Edu-
cation framework. She also fought 
for lower electricity rates in San 
Diego over the summer. 

We believe that her opponent, 
Judge Larry Stirling, does not have 
the Wide-ranging viSion for our City 
and state that Alpert has. We there-
fore endorse Dede Alpert for the 
39th district of the State Senate. 

California State 
ASSEMBLY 

Christine Kehoe 
The Guardian endorses City 

Councilwoman Christine Kehoe 
for State Assembly. Kehoe has a 
strong educational and environ-
mental record, and supports a vari-
ety of solutions to our traffic prob-
le ms, including increased mass 
transit. Kehoe is also a strong pro-
ponent of gun control. 

Kehoe 's opponent, Michele 
Nash-Hoff, has very specific plans, 
but the Guardian feels the issues 
Kehoe addresses are more crucial 
to San Diegans, and endorse Kehoe 
for the 76th district of the State 
Asse~bly. 

'Ill I!) ELECTION (,lllril' 

Public office holders should not 
have to do this. 

The Guardian endorses 
Proposition 33 because it is not 
about further accommodating 
members of the legislature, but 
rather, about treating them the 
same as everyone else. 

Campaign Finance 
PROP 34 

Vote No 
Sen. John McCain from Ari-

zona campaigned hard for the 
issue of campaign finance reform 
while he was running for presi-
dent. Proposition 34 brings cam-
paign finance reform to the fore-
front in California. While the 
proposition has good intentions, 
the details show the inadequa-
cies of Proposition 34. There-
fore, the Guardian ~ cannot 
endorse this proposition. 

Briefly, Proposition 34 would 
set limits on the amounts indi-
viduals and companies con-
tribute to state politicians' cam-
paigns. The limit of $6,000, pri-
mary and general elections com-
bined, for legislative candidates 

The UCSD Guardian 

would be implemented with the 
2002 elections. A limit of $40,000 
will be set for each election cycle 
for gubernatorial candidates and 
limits· of $10,000 per election 
cycle will be imposed on all other 
statewide elections, such as Trea-
surer and Secretary of State. 

While Proposition 34 looks 
attractive standing alone, com-
pared to an earlier campaign 
finance reform proposition, 
Proposition 208, it is much 
weaker. 

Proposition 208 is 'much 
more stringent with the imposed 
limits - $2,000 each election 
cycle for statewide candidates 
and $ 1 ,000 each election cycle 
for legislative candidates who 
agree to limit their overall cam-
paign spending. If passed, Propo-
sition 34 would nullify the earli-
er PropOSition 208. 

Another argument against 
Proposition 34 is that it does 
nothing to stem the flow of soft 
money. Soft money is a contribu-
tion made to a political party and 
then distributed to the candi-
dates of the same political party. 
Considered a loophole in current 
campaign finance laws, soft

money unlimited and unregulat-
ed and is the main problem facing 
campaign finance. 

Proposition 34 does not sup-
ply the type of campaign finance 
reform that California needs. It 
nullifies the earlier, more strin-
gent Prop. 208 (still battling 
through the State Supreme 
Court) and does not address the 
huge problem of soft money. For 
these reasons, the Guardian 
opposes Proposition 34. 

Public Works Projects 
PROP 35 

Vote Yes 
The Guardian supports Propo-

sition 35, a measure that would 
allow the state to contract with 
private enti ties to provide archi-
tectural and engineering services 
in the construction of public 
works projects. The measure 
imposes a competitive selection 
process in awarding engineering 
and architectural contracts. 

Currently, services provided by 
state agencies generally must be 
performed by state civil service 
employees. Contracting to private 
firms is only allowed if services 
are of a temporary nature, not 
available within the civil service, 
or are of a highly specialized or 
technical nature. This measure 
would allow the state government 
to contract construction-related 
projects in any case, rather than 
just on an exception basis. 

The Guardian supports this 
measure because we do not 
believe the government should 
have a monopoly. California has 
serious traffic problems, and 
when the government decides to 
expand our infrastructure, there is 
often a backlog of projects. Cal-
Trans cannot do it all alone. 

When there is a short-term

Drug Treatment 
PROP 36 

Vote No 

Drugs are a serious problem in 
the United States. Drug a use 
poisons our society, increasing 
violent crimes and creating a 
debilitating addiction for anyone 
who falls prey to narcotics. Some-
thing needs to be done to deter 
the crime and help the addict. 

We at the Guardian feel that 
Proposition 36 on Tuesday's bal-
lot is not the answer, and that a 
"no" vote is suited at the voting 
booth, 

Proposition 36 "diverts certain 
drug offenders from incarceration 
to treatment and probation, 
applicable to those convicted for 
the first and second time of drug 
possession offenses and most 
nonviolent offenders who violate 
parole using drugs. The measure 
would allocate $120 million a year 
for treatment." 

Instead of going to jail, under 
Propsition 36, convicted drug 
users would be sentenced to 
rehabilitation. Rehab alone is not 
a solution to the drug problem. 
The fear of spending time in · 
prison is required to deter crimi-
nals no matter wrat the crime. 
Punishment for breaking the law 
needs to be doled out. Drug 
rehab can be done, but it should 
be done behind bars while the 
criminal serves the necessary time 

. for his offense as required by law. 
Proposition 36 is not just one 

"get out of jail free" card. It is a 
pair of "get out of jail free" cards, 
for "first and second-time con-
victed drug possessors. " How 
many second chances can some-
one get? Knowing that there will 
not be a suitable punishment only 
encourages drug abuse. It does 
not in any way deter it. 

The Guardian feels that 
addicts do need help in breaking 
their habit. Proposition 36 means 
well, but because of lenient con-
sequences, it is . not the solution. 

Vote Requirements: Taxes 

PROP 37 
Vote No 

Proposition 37, a state consti-
tutional amendment to "redefine 
certain regulatory fees as taxes." is 

The UCSD Guardian 

ELECTION 

opposed by the Guardian. We feel 
that, if the proposition passes, it 
will allow large, polluting compa-
nies to avoid paying for wastes. 

Proposition 37 changes some 
regulation fees to taxes. While a 
simple majority in the California 
Legislature to impose a regulato-
ry fee on companies, taxes 
require a more stringent two-
thirds majoirty to pass. In addi-
tion, local taxes require a two-
thirds majority of the electorate. 
Fees do not require voter 
approval. 

While it may seem like this 
proposition would make it more 
difficult for the government "to 
slap a regulatory fee on business-
es," it also allows large companies 
to get out of paying for the pollu-
tion they cause. If the proposition 
passes, it would be harder for the 
government to financially regu-
fate companies' pollution. Instead 
of the simple majority required to 
impose the regulatory fees, it 
would require a two-thirds 
majority. The taxpayers would 
then be left to pay for the clean-
up. 

The list of supporters of the 
proposition seems to be com-
prised of the usual big-business 
corporations: The proposition 
was placed on the ballot by alco-
hol , tobacco and oil companies. 
These types of business have 
spent millions endorsing Proposi-
tion 37 to ensure its passage. 

Proposition 37 is a suspicious 
act prop'lgated by big businesses 
that want to avoid paying for their 
pollution. [t is bad for California 
and the Guardian opposes this 
proposition. 

School Vouchers 
PROP 38 

Vote No 

Proposition 38, if passed on 
Nov. 7, would authorize mini-
mum annual state payments of 
$4,000 to any private educational 
institution to which a parent 
chooses to send his child. 
Although it is intended to diversi-
fy and embellish the academic 
experiences of California stu-
dents, the initiative is rampant 
with flaws and is not supported 
by the Guardian. 

Although Proposition 38 
states that private schools wishing 
to redeem state-issued vouchers 
cannot "advocate unlawful 

behavior" or "discriminate on the 
basis or race, ethnicity, color or 
national origin: the proposed 
amendment does not protect Cal-
ifornians (students or not) from 
enduring the violation of one 
essential concept upon which our 
nation was founded. 

According the U.S. Constitu-
tion and' a handful of u.s. 
Supreme Court decisions, the 
state cannot entangle itself in 
the affairs of religious institu-
tions, such as religiously based 
private schools. That Proposi-
tion 38 could annually channel 
$1.1 billion of taxpayers' money 
toward religious private schools 
proves that the initiative is 
inconsistent with the rhetoric of 
our national identity and one of 
Americans' most cherished 
rights - freedom from state-
endorsed religion. 

Not only does Proposition 38 
make an obvious leap over the 
church-state boundary, but it also 
restricts state and local authori-
ties from demanding that private 
schools receiving voucher money 
meet state academic reqUire-
ments. 

Furthermore, the proposition 
establishes significant new 
restrictions on the ability of gov-
ernments to adopt new regula-
tions regarding private schools. 

Specificafly, local govern-
ments could not establish new 
health, safety or land use regula-
tions for private schools unless 
they attain a two-thirds approval 
of the local governing body in 
addition to a majority vote in an 
election held in the affected 
area. 

These burdensome restric-
tions would make it nearly 
impossible for local citizens to 
demand that private schools 
adhere to important changes 
such as updated health codes, 
bans on expansion due to envi-
ronmental • issues, or even 
improved fire and earthquake 
regulations. 

Overall , Proposition 38's 
authors may have meant well by 
attempting to increase students' 
educational options and trying to 
eliminate economic barriers to 
the private school experience, but 
we believe the initiative they have 
placed on the November ballot is 
not only unconstitutional, but 
also unfair to the students who 
may end up stuck in schools that 
cannot be forced to meet state 
academic standards, local health 
ordinances, or even environmen-

tal regulations. The Guardian 
refuses to endorse this risky ini-
tiative and encoura~es voters to 
vote no on Proposition 38. 

School Facilities Bonds 
PROP 39 

Vote Yes 
California schools are in an 

awful state of despair. Overcrowd-
ed classrooms are the norm and 
the buildings are run-down. Stu-
dents are packed like sardines 
into dilapidated buildings and are 
expected to receive a proper edu-
cation. 

The Guardian believes that 
Proposition 39 can be a solution 
to the problem and deserves a 
"yes" vote. 

According to the Voter [nfor-
mation Pamphlet, Proposition 39 
" makes it easier to get voter 
approval of local bonds for school 
construction, which are paid off 
though higher property taxes. The 
current requirement that bonds 
be approved by two-thirds of vot-
ers would be lowered to 55 per-
cent: 

This is the best thing that can 
be ·done to help schools, Institu-
tions of learning are important to 
our society and need the money, 
and they rely on bonds to provide 
the necessary funds. Because of 
today's stringent two-thirds rule, 
it is sometimes impossible for a 
well-meaning bond to pass. 
Nothing gets accomplished, and 
it is the children that end up get-
ting hurt. 

Some bonds do not pass 
because homeowners refuse to 
give back to the community in 
which they live. Many older citi-
zens often do not feel it is neces-
sary to help out the younger 
members of the community. In 
reality, the burden to a home-
owner on paying back bonds 
comes down to a few dollars a 
month, and Proposition 39 
would free up this much-needed 
money. 

Lowering the required votes 
to 55 percent shields well-inten-
tioned schools from being 
denied funds to build new class-
rooms. At the same time it does 
not make the law too lenient, 
which a simple majority vote 
would do. 

Our public schools need dras-
tic help. Proposition 39 is a step 
in the . right direction.

~D & 'NATION 
Voting Results Solidify KoIOYo'. 
Leader's Stance Among Albanians 

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia 
Ibrahim Rugova, long the political 
leader of the Albanians in Kosovo, 
is once more in the ascendant after 
his party, the Democratic League of 
Kosovo, emerged the winner in 
local elections last week. 

Sitting in his elaborately fur-
nished home in Pristina, the enig-
matic Rugova seemed quietly elat-
ed. Although he lost some popu-
larity during the armed rebellion 
led by younger Albanians against 
the Serbs in 1998 and 1999, this 
historian of literature has always 
insisted that he is the elected pres-
ident of Kosovo Albanians. He 
emerged the undisputed winner of 
makeshift elections - held in 
homes and garages because of 
Serbian police harassment - in 
1992 and again in 1998, but now 
he is much more sure of that claim. 

Rugova's party won nearly 60 
percent of the vote in the Oct. 28 
municipal elections organized by 
the foreign officials who run 
Kosovo, gaining majority control 
of 21 of the 30 municipalities. 

Even if, as many suggest, the 
vote was more a protest against 
the unsavory behavior of many 
former rebels since the Kosovo 

war ended in June 1999, the result 
showed Rugova 's political stamina 
and enduring appeal as a Gandhi-
like father figure for many 
Albanians in Kosovo. 

If, as now expected, Rugova 
wins the general elections that 
could be held next year, he will 
most likely find himself negotiat-
ing Kosovo's future status within 
Yugoslavia, the Balkans and 
Europe. 

Rugova, 54, formed his politi-
cal party in 1990 and essentially 
headed a long campaign against 
Siobodan Milosevic, who as presi-

. dent of Serbia abolished Kosovo's 
autonomy in 1989. During the 
war over Kosovo last year, when 
he had a still unexpla ined meeting 
with Milosevic, he was almost 
deemed a traitor. 

Now, Rugova said in an hour-
long interview conducted with an 
Albanian translator in which he 
parried all questions about that 
meeting, support has swung back 
to him. "Eventually people wanted 
to see a mOre stable and experi-
enced leadership" than the rebels, 
he said. 

He urged rapid international 
recognition of Kosovo's indepen-

dence from Yugoslavia while the 
NATO-led peacekeeping force 
and the U.N. mission are still in 
charge of the province. 

"[t would finally clarify things," 
Rugova said. "You have to under-
stand there is still among 
Albanians anxiety and fear of 
Belgrade, and that fear comes from 
decades-long experience of repres-
sion by the regime in Serbia. With 
independ.:nce, then people would 
have much more respect for 
minorities and their rights. 

"But right now people are not 
sure what will happen," he said, 
apparently alluding to the killing 
and violent harassment of Serbs in 
Kosovo, which was the heart of the 
Serbs' medieval empire and is cen-
tral to their national mythology. 

He cares little, he said, whether 
Belgrade agrees with him, indicat-
ing that international support was 
more important. "If the U.S. has a 
say, then eventually Belgrade will 
have to comply; he said. "Kosovo 
is a de facto international issue 
and [ .have been saying we are de 
facto independen t already:

Undecided Voters Hold Key to the 
Election, Recent Poll Indicates 

The finish line is finally in 
sight, bur Vice President AI Gore 
and Gov. George W. Bush remain 
ensnarled in one of the closest 
presidential races of the century, 
according to the final New York 
,Times/CBS News Poll . 

The poll suggests that the 
candi<!ates are still struggling to 
lure a tiny pool of undecided 
voters. Among people likely to 
turn out on Tuesday, Bush draws 
46 percent, Gore 41 percent, 
Ralph Nader S percent and Pat 
Buchanan 1 percent. While 
Bush's advantage is in itself sta-
tistically insignificant, it reflects 
an edge he has maintained in 
this and most other national sur-
veys. 

But the national figures are 
only one gauge, because the out-
come ultimately hinges on state-
by-state contests. And the map is 
something of a jumble: it shows 
that either candidate is within 
reach of assembling the magic 270 
electoral votes to capture the 
White House. 

Beyond being so stubbornly 

close, the race has been extraordi-
narily fluid over the past month or 
so, with Bush and Gore trading 
places in many vital states - often 
within the margin of error. The 
numbers seem so mercurial that 
some analysts and operatives have 
begun referring to the Gallup poll 
as the Nasdaq. 

Several fresh polls on Sunday 
did little to yank this race out of 
the nail-biter category. They sug-
gest that while Bush holds a 
slight edge, neither candidate 
was ahead in some of the most 
important states. In Florida and 
Wisconsin, the margin was one 
percentage pomt. In 
Pennsylvania it was two. [t was 
dead even in New Mexico and 
Tennessee. Each candidate has 
far more votes in his strongest 
states than he needs to win the 
electoral votes in those states. 
For example, Bush leads by a 
daunting margin in Texas, while 
Gore has impressive support in 
New York. 

,The national poll conducted 
by the Times and CBS News was 

of 1,356 registered voters, includ-
ing 862 likely voters, and was 
taken Wednesday through 
Saturday. It has a margin of sam-
pling error of plus or minus three 
percentage points. 

Some internal findings in the 
survey give Gore less comfort 
than the overall horserace. Gore's 
unfavorable rating has risen more 
briskly than Bush's since Labor 
Day. It now stands six points 
higher than Bush's, although nei-
ther candidate has been able to 
break through the SO percent 
favorability mark. Sixty percent of 
respondents said Gore says what 
he thinks people want to hear, 
while only 48 percent said that of 
Bush. 

And in another favorable sign 
for Bush, 59 percent of his sup-
porters described their support fot 
him as "enthusiastic," while only 
44 percent of Gore's supporters 
said the Same about him. .

Gore said from the pulpit of the 
Morris Brown A.M. E. Church in 
North Philadelphia. It was the first 
time in days that he evoked the 
name of the president who has 
bedeviled him throughout the 
campaign but whose popularity in 
certain circles is undeniable. Gore 
credited the "change" wrought by 
Clinton to the strong economy, 
adding that "progressive policies 
are more easily pursued when we

deficits, we've got the biggest sur-
pluses. Instead of repeat recessions, 
we've tripled the market." 

On this final Sunday before the

from direct assaults on Gov. George

drumbeat against the governor by 
deploying various allies to go after

Past V .. Proves a Bad V .. for 'Concept' Stocks 
They began going public sev-

enl ~ears ago, promising to use 
txcinng new technology to revo-
lurionize the way people around 
the world live and work. Though 
they were nrely profitable and 
many barely had sales, their 
potential <;sptivated investors. As 
their stocks soared, analysts and 
commentators offered ever more 
gnndiose predictions of the com-
panies' impact, and investment 
bankers rushed to take more and 
more of them public. 

Ify the peak of the frenzy earlier 
this year, many carried multibil-
lion-doUar market valuations. Then 
the boom ended. In a matter of 
months. the stocks plunged by half 

or two-thirds from their highs. 
Some have fallen even further, leav-
ing unwary or overly enthusiastic 
investors with near-total losses. 

And no, they are not Internet 
companies. 

Amid the meltdown of Net 
stocks. less noti~d has been the 
fact that investors have also fled 
former highftiers in other emerging 
industries. ranging from alternative 
energy and fuel cell developers like 
Plug Power to second- and third-
tier biotechnology and genomics 
companies like SuperGen and Axys 
Pharmaceuticals. 

These are what Wall Street calls 
"concept stocks," and they have 
had. very bad year. Plug Power, for 

example. has fallen to $23.63 from 
its January peak of $156.50, an 85 
percent drop that has cost its 
shareholders $6 billion. SuperGen 
has lost about threc-quarters of its 
value in eight months, sliding from 
$77.31 to $19.38. 

The boom and bust was 
inevitable, said Roger McNamee, 
general partner of Integral Capital 
Partners, a Menlo Park, Calif., 
money management firm . " Every 
major economic wave in the 
United States has been driven by 
financial mania," McNamee said. 

After watching information 
technology companies like Cisco 
Systems and Dell Computer grow 
seemingly overnight from fledgling 

startups to hu,gely profitable corpo-
rate giants, by the late 1990s 
investors were clamoring for the 
chance to buy shares in all sorts of 
extremely youn$ companies with 
novel technologies - the kinds of 
businesses that in less giddy times 
had relied solely on venture capi-
talists for financing. 

Now those investors have had 
to face the truth , long known to 
venture capitalists, that big returns 
do not come without big risks and 
that most young companies fail, 
said John P. Whaley, a partner at 
Norwest Venture Partners, which 
manages $1.2 billion. 

"A lot of the ideas that were 
being floated were a lot of vapor 

the National Guard, his 1976 arrest 
for drunk driving, and his spurning 
of pleas for a hate-crimes law from 
the family of James Byrd Jr. , the 
black man who was dragged to his 
death in 1998 in a racially motivat-
ed attack in Texas. 

Perhaps the harshest assess-
ment came from Sen. Bob Kerrey, 
D-Neb. At a ra lly in Pittsburgh 
Saturday night, Kerrey noted that 
Bush said he had not disclosed his 
drunk-driving arrest because he 
wanted to protect his daughters, an 
excuse Kerrey flatly rejected. "That 
reminded me of the old song by 
Willie Nelson, ' Are You Gonna 
Believe Me or Your Lying Eyes?'" 
Kerrey said. · You're covering your 
rear end," he said of Bush . "How 
dare you say that your character is 
superior to vice president Gore's?" 

Gore did not discourage these 
attacks and clearly delighted in the 
increasingly vocal reaction in his 
crowds to Bush. As people in the 
crowd here ca lled out slurs against 
Bush, Gore chuckled and said, "I'm 
getting some good lines here." 
They were inappropriate for a pres-
idential candidate to utter, of 
course, but the vice president 
egged on his listeners anyway. "I 
can't use them," he said, "but you 
can use them:

headlining bands also present. 

"This would have been great

1900s. In addition to touring the 
parks, users will also be able to 
see hand-tinted postcards from 
the period. view movies made 
about amusement parks before 
1925 and read educational texts 
on their history and societal 
impact. 

Work on the program has 
already begun with a three-dimen-
sional animator and two teams of 
research professors. including five 
from the University of Iowa. 
Rabinovitz has not yet decided how 
the program will be marketed, she 
said, but it will be I.1sed as a teach-
ing tool. 

An early version will be com-
pleted by February, and a more 
refined copy will be finished in 
May. Rabinovitz and her team will 
spend the next year testing the pro-
gram before its presentation. 

The project will present the 
argument that amusement parks at 
the tum of the century not only 
gave people enjoyment but helped 
them to accept technological 
advances and changes in society.

Dies de los Muertos is 
a traditional Mexican 
.holiday that cele-
brates the dead and 
recognizes that they 
live on in the afterlife 

Each culture has a different way of 
mourning those who have passed on. 
Death is very hard to deal with, to accept 
and to appreciate. There is no right or 
wrong way to mourn . 

In America, death is dealt with in a 
very dark way. It is very solemn and 
quiet. A few miles away, however, people 
deal with. death with a very different atti· 
tude, as it is celebrated in a two-day fes· 
tival known as "dias de los muertos.n 

Dias de los muertos translates to 
"days of the dead." It is a time when peo-
ple in Mexico recognize, and at the same 
time celebrate, those who have died. It is 
a happy celebration where the dead 
come back to the world of the living for 
a day to be with loved ones. They come ' 
back to eat, drink and have a good time. 

Deceased children come home to 
visit on the night of Oct. 31 and must be 
gone by the afternoon of Nov. 1. That is 
when the adults come home to visit and 
stay until mid-day Nov. 2. 

The family greets the deceased adult 
with several offerings, including aromas

The Editor's Soapbox 
There are no shortcuts to popularity, but building up a little confidence is all it takes to get there 
8, JOSH CROUSE 
Features Editor 

Now, I know that I've written a 
soapbox already this quarter and 
some of you may be tired of my 
rants. Well, that's just too bad. I'm 
the features editor, and since I have 
something on my mind, ['m going 
to abuse my power and lecture y'all 
for a while. 

ormally, I'd take this opportu-
nity to try to persuade your vote in 
the upcoming election. However, 
since both George "Excuse me offi-
cer, I know I'm drunk, but do I 
have any coke on my nose?" Bush 
and AI "Let me take a public opin-
ion poll before answering the ques-
tion" Gore are pathetically lacking 
in political appeal, I'm not going to 
waste my time. 

Instead, ['m going to voice my 
opinion on something that has 
really been bothering me lately. As [ 
sat in the movie theater with my 
friend last week and watched the 
gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley flaunt 
herself around the screen in 
skimpy outfits in the new movie 
"Bedazzled; I was struck with a 
moment of clarity. (Yes, I know that 
is a phrase reserved for alcoholics. 
I'm comfortable with myself, are 
you?) 

The movie revolves around the 
basic notion that we can all be the 
popular, cool person we want to be 
if we just have confidence in our-
selves and forget about what other 
people think. Your initial reaction 
may be that things like that don't 
really work in the real world. Some 
people just aren't popular and 
never will be. That is the attitude 
some people took as they left the 
theater. I jllst chuckled to myself at 
th"l r utter stupidity, for I knew the 
truth . The truth is that it is that 
simple. 

Too often, people want to think 
that the world is just too compli-
cated to figure out. Occum's Razor 
is a scientific notion that, all things 
being equal, the simplest explana-
tion is usually the right one. Now, 
which would be simpler: There is 
some sllpernatural force that judi-
ciously pre-selects \tho will be 
popular and who won't - or we 

are all created equal and simple 
self-confidence is the only thing 
separating the popular people from 
the unpopular. 

For those of you who refute 
sound scientific evidence, how 
about a real-life tale of how confi-
dence changed the life of an 
unpopular geek? Yes, I am talking 
about myself, unfortunately. 

I was completely unpopular 
when I entered the eighth grade. 
Prior to that, I was a geek. I had 
never gotten any grade below an A 
in my academic career. I had never 
been suspended from school, nor 
even had a detention, for that mat-
ter. I don't even think I was tardy 
until I was 12. 

The bottom line was that I had 
no self-confidence. I completely 
doubted myself. I was always crush-
ing on some girl, but I never had the 
cajones to talk to her. I had a few 
friends, but I mainly kept to myself. 
[ was completely horrified at the 
notion of rejection. I just kept to my 
school work, something I knew that 
I was good at and something that 
could not possibly reject me. 

[ stayed like that until I entered 
eighth grade and met my best 
friend, Matt. Matt was a popular 
guy who lived in the nice part of 
town and hung out with all the 
popular rich kids. He was athletic 
and had girls all over him. I was 
envious. 

To this day I don't know how it 
happened, but for some reason we 
connected. We started hanging out. 
I always felt weird because we 
would hang out with the otlier 
popular kids, whom I didn't really 
know. They would ,all talk to me, 
but I still felt like an outsider. I felt 
like I didn't belong. I still had no 
confidence in myself. 

Matt and I continued to be great 
friends in high school, becoming 
closer with each passing year, yet I 
still could not help but feel like an 
outsider. 

I continued to have that feeling 
until my family went on a vacation 
to Palm Springs the summer before 
my junior year. We were staying 
there for a week. On the third night 
there, I decided to go to the pool 
alone and relax in the hot Palm

As I entered the pool, I 
feasted my ey~ on the 
most beautifUL creature 
k1wwn to man. She was 
completely gorgeous. 
Well, that's what I 
thought back then.

Springs night air. 
As I entered the pool, I feasted 

my eyes on the most beautiful crea-
ture known to man. She was com-
pletely gorgeous. Well, that's what I 
thought back then. Of course, I 
have seen several hundred "most 
beautiful creatures known to man" 
since then. 

Looking back now, I see that 
moment as a turning point in my 
life. As I made the decision to give 
myself some credit and go talk to 
her, I knew that it was going to be 
something big. I just didn't know 
how big until now, because I've had 
time to reflect on the ensuing path 
that my life took. 

I still can't believe that I actual-
ly talked to her. Even more amaz-
ing than that, though, was the fact 
that she was smiling at me and 
talking back. I was stunned as she 
leaned over and kissed me as [ 
walked her back to her room (as 
sad as it is for me to admit, even 
though I was 16, it was my first 

kiss). We spent the next few days 
together. Just walking around with 
her by my side and seeing the 
other guys look at me with jeal-
ousy did wonders for my confi-
dence. 

When I returned to school that 
fall, my first order of business was 
to get me a woman. I succeeded 
after only a few weeks and found a 
very attractive tall blond. 

In addition to having a girl-
friend, I also started going to par-
ties with Matt. I remember the 
look on people's faces when they 
saw me drinking at the first few 
parties that I went to. A few people 
came up to me and asked, "You 
drink?" [just smiled and pounded 
my beer with newfound confi-
dence. 

After a while, the looks on peo-
ple's faces at the parties went from 
disbelief to welcome. They were 

_ actually getting excited to see me 
at the parties. My friends and I 
would show up a few hours ' Iate 
and bask in the stares of all in 
attendance as they watched our 
grand arrival. People would rush 
up to greet us and hand us alcohol. 
I was in heaven. 

My transformation was not lim-
ited to late-night partying. I was 
also getting more popular at 
school. I noticed that more girls 
were smiling at me as I walked by. 
More guys were coming up to me 
to see how [ was doing or what 
party I would be going to that 
weekend. 

By. the time I was a senior, I 
was one of the kings of the 
school. I could walk up to any 
social group and be immediately 
accepted. I was friends with every-
one. I couldn't walk SO feet 
around my high school campus 
without having to talk to some-
body that I knew. 

At the time of my graduation, 
my house had become one of the 
premiere party stops. [n fact, my 
New Year's Eve celebration for the 
millenium was deemed by many as 
one of the best-ever parties. 

Now, the pqint of this long-
winded recap of my life is that 
change can occur. It doesn't matter 
how lonely or awkward you may 

feel now. Just a little bit of confi-
dence is all you need. 

For me, that little spark came 
from a life-changing decision: I 
decided to believe in myself. That 
was all that it took. Everything else 
grew from there. 

I look back now and wonder 
why I was so afraid to take that 
slep sooner in my life. I really wish 
that I had. It tallght me a lot. I 
learned that "popular" people are 
not all that much different from 
you and I. They have the same 
wants, same needs and same 
desires that other people have. 
They are not some strange breed 
of human beings who are totally 
different from the rest of us. They 
are just the ones who decided to 
believe in themselves at an earlier 
age. 

For those of you out there who 
are wondering if this really works, 
try it. You can even start small and 
build up your confidence from 
there. Go up 10 someone in one of 
your classes and talk to them about 
the last midterm. Ask them about 
their other ' classes. Just talk to 
them. 

After that, build up from there. 
Go talk to a stranger who's waiting 
in line with you to get fooQ . I guar-
antee you will start to feel more 
confident. Then , when YOll feci up 
to it, go up to those people who 
you've been wanting to hang out 
with. Start a conversation with 
them. They will not laugh at you. 
Trust me. 

Once that confidence is there, it 
won't go. away. II's kind of like rid-
ing a bicycle or having sex - just 
climb on and start going. It will all 
come back to you . 

Well, there you have it: A guide 
to gaining confidence in yourself 
and using it to break out of your 
self-imposed isolation and gct 
social. Even if you really have no 
desire to hang out with the "popu-
lar" people, the confidence YOll can 
gain just from talking to them can 
be used in an infinite number of 
ways that will make YOll a happier 
person in the long run.

merman, president of the Men's 
Wearhouse, "I guarantee it."

eople don't like getting hit 
by cars. However, to the 
many students at UCSD, 
who use bicycles as an 
alternative form of trans-
portation, the threat is very 

About 20,000 students attend 
UCSD, the population of a small town. 
Although not all students are on campus 
at once, the rules pertaining to bicyclists 
in small towns can be applied to our 
own campus. The number of students 
who bike on campus is small compared 
to the number of pedestrians, but 
cyclists still make up a significant por-
tion, since they are spread across the 
campus. 

One major problem for student 
cycliSts are the roads surrounding the 
campus. Because of UCSD's close prox-
imity to Interstate 5, there are many 
major roadways, which means more 
cars, faster speed limits, fewer pedestri-
ans and more danger. 

The intersection of Genesee Avenue 
and North Torrey Pines Road is a very 
tricky to cross (or some cyclists. Not 
only is there a banked incline on North 
Torrey Pines toward Genesee, but the 
bike lane from the right also crosses 
between the slow lane that turns left 

FEATURES 15 

MetlSSll Chow/~an 

onto Genesee and the right-turn lane. 
For bikers with backpacks trying to stay 
alert, the intersection, with cars passing 
at high speeds, proves to be very danger-
ous . 

Another extremely dangerous route 
is on La Jolla Village Drive, where cars 
can merge into Interstate S. On both 
sides of the street, the bicycle lanes are 
nonexistent, which makes the road dan-
gerous for commuting cyclists. Cars 
speed up to 40 to SO mph to get onto the 
on-ramp, and student cyclists are in the 
middle of it. On top of this, in order to 
pass the on-ramp, student riders must 
ride between two car lanes for a distance 
before the on-ramp lane ends and the 
bridge over Interstate 5 begins. 

A similar situation occurs at La Jolla 
Village Drive toward campus where a 
right turn lane goes toward Gilman 
Drive. Students are forced to take this 
road because of the steep incline of Villa 
La Jolla Drive that leads to the new park-
ing structure near Eleanor Roosevelt 
College . . 

Other dangerous intersection zones 
for bikers are Gilman Drive and Voigt 
Drive. near the Scripps and Ximed Cen-
ter. The T-junction is busy with shuttles

Learning the Voting Process is Important 
The Electoral College dates back to the founding of the country and has evolved over time 

\ 

.y JOSH CIIOUII 
Features Editor 

For many students at UCSD, 
this will be the first presidential 
election in which they will be 
allowed to vote. One would hope 
that after years of waiting for this 
chance to assert their political pref-
erences in the voting booth, these 
eager young voters would have a 
firm grasp on the election proces·s. 
However, the sad but true fact of 
the matter is that many students 
are still left without a clue as to 
now the president and vice presi-
dent are elected. 

The candidate that receives the 
most votes does not always win the 
election. In fact, there have been 
two instances in the nation's histo-
ry in which the person who won 
the majority of the popular vote 
failed to win the election. 

The first instance was in 1824 
when nobody received a majority 
of electoral votes and the House of 
Representatives narrowly selected

passing through to the East cam-
pus parking lot, cars emerging from 
the Pepper Canyon parking lot and 
speeding cars on the straight-away 
from off-campus. The intersection 
may be a three-way stop, but with 
the traffic congestion, construc-
tion, uneven roads and drivers who 
take up the center of the intersec-
tion coming into one of the lanes, it 
proves to be dangerous. 

According to UCSD traffic offi-
cer Jeff Cox, the various roads and 
intersections around campus such 

John Quincy Adams for president, 
despite the fact that Andrew Jack-
son had received the plurality of 
the popular vote. 

In 1888, Benjamin Harrison 
won narrow victories in several big 
states to win the election over 
incumbent Grover Cleveland, 
despite Cleveland getting more 
than 110,000 more popular VOleS 
than Harrison. 

The fact is, presidents are not 
elected by the people. They are 
elected by the Electoral College, a 
system that has been around since 
the beginning of the country and 
has evolved over time to fit the 
needs of the election. 

Each state is allocated a number 
of electors that is equal to its num-

Each political party submits a

election official. These individuals 

to blame. If students see the nUIn-
ber of cyclists on campus, they 
should try to count how many wear 
helmets. The result is disappoint-
ing. Wearing a helmet is required 
by state law for minors. That does 
not mean that people who wear 
helmets are simply too old to wear 
them. The old adage that it is better 
to be safe than sorry rings true in 
the case of bicycle helmets. Despite 
that, the vast majority of students 
on campus do not wear helmets. 

Since NOllember, there have 
been eight major bicycle accidents 
on campus. Five of the eight 
cyclists involved were not wearing 
helmets and resulted in serious 
injuries. The ignorance and lack of 
observance of this simple rule is 
baffling.

tioned above, as 
well as others 
including Justice

The old adage that 
it is better to be safe 
than sorry rings 
true in the case of 
bUycle helmets. 
Despite that, the 
vast majority of 
students on campus 
do not wear helmets. 

The fact that 
some student riders 
do not follow the 
rules also causes 
more problems. 

. Last year, a colli-
sion at Voigt Drive 
and Gilman Drive 
occurred due to an 
urrhelmeted stu-
dent running a stop 
sign. 

On justice Lane, 
which goes from 
the shuttle stop to 
the Warren, apart-

mation concerning the various city 
plans for bicyclists. 

"Bike lanes already exist all the 
way up to North Torrey Pines 
Road to Del Mar and along old 
Highway 101 to Encinitas," Stein-
dorf said. "However, La Jolla Vil-
lage Drive was not designated a 
bike route in the community plan. 
But Nobd, Genesee, Regents, Villa 
La Jolla and Gilman are all desig-
nated to tventually include bike 
lanes. The City of San Diego will 
be responsible for this funding, 
implementation and improve-
ments: 

Also, the concern for Msmart" 
traffic lights that do not ~quire a 
person to touch the signal but will 
be automatically timed, is also a 
major issue since some cars, not to 
mention cyclists, run ~d lights. 
Whenever the school is made 
aware of traffic light mechanisms 
that are not tripped by bicycles, the 
city's bicycle coordinator is con-
tacted so that the problem can be 
fixed right away. Still, there are traf-
fic lights that do not switch right 
away. 

"To be a biker on campus 
sucks,· said sophomore Austin 
Leach. "The motorists don't give 
us any respect and see us as mere 
speed bumps: 

The school and city are not all 

ments (also another hazardous 
road because of the volume of 
vehicles passing through), a stu-
dent with no helmet was not pay-
ing attention and slammed into a 
vehicle that stopped. 

lWo accidents within the last 
year happened on the intersections 
of Gilman Drive with Mandeville 
Lane and Matthews Lane, with 
both sets of students not wearing 
any protective ~ear. 

The schools history regarding 
cyclists is not a long one. UCSD 
was not originally planned to have 
a large student bicyclist population, 
and thus exclusive use of bicycle 
lanes was not implemented. The 
school, however, is continuing to 
implement a loop road shared by 
bicycles and vehicles, with interior 
loops for bikers to get to key pans 
of campus. 

For those bicyclists who com-
plain about constandy havin~ to 
bike up a hill, they should take Into 
account the several locations that 
the 'campus could have been locat-
ed. Those include Balboa Park and 
Lake Murray, both of which would I 
have provided considerably more 
'hills for bikers to climb. Much of 
the present campus is located on a 
hill with a relatively modest incline, 
with the highest elevation being at 
Peterson Hall. 

The fact is, presidents are 
not elected by the people. 
They are elected by the 
Electoral College, a 
system that has been 
around since the 
beginning of the country 
and has evolved over time 
to fit the needs of the 
election. 
pledged their vote to the party's 
presidential candidate. The num-
ber of individuals is equal to the 
number of electoral votes the state 
was allocated. 

When voters vote on the Tues-
day following the first Monday in 
November, they vote for the slate of 
individuals from the party that will 
in tum vote for their presidential 
candidate.

The party that wins the most 
popular votes in a state gets to have 
Its slate of electors cast that state's 
electoral votes. This is true of every 
state except Maine and Nebraska, 
which have two electors chosen 
statewide, while the other electors 
are chosen by each congressional 
district. 

Each elector is given two votes. 
One vote is for the president and 
the other vote is for the vice presi-
dent. 

In the event of a tie in electoral 
votes, the U.S. House of Represen-
tatives will determine who becomes 
president. . 

Some students may ask them-
selves why such a system would be 
used if it did not always represent 
what the majority of the people 
want. 

The early United States was 
made up of 13 states of various 
sizes that fought hard for states' 
rights while remaining suspicious 
of a central government.

of 1787 considered several options 
for electing the president and vice 
president before settling on the 
Electoral College, according to 
William C. Kimberling, the deputy 
director of the Federal Election 
Commission Office of Election 
Administration, in an essay of his 
titled, "The Electoral College: 

One of the first ideas was to 
have Congress choose the presi-

because many people at the Con-

would cause too much political 
bargaining and corruption among 
candidates and members of Con-
gress. Others thought that it would 
upset the delicate balance of power 
between the legislative and execu-

ment. 

Another proposal was to allow 
the state legislatures to select the 
president. This idea was rejected

Art •• (March 21-April19) 
Let your conscience be your 

guide on Monday. It'll be harder 
on Tuesday because that little 
voice may tell you something you 
don't want to hear. Around 
Wednesday you start feeling agi-
tated and eager to take action. If 
you wait until Thursday and plan 
.. !II the possibilities before making 
your decision, your chances of 
success will improve. On Friday 
you may have to defend your 
position, especially if money's 
involved. Hold off on shopping 
until Sunday, when you're more 
apt to choose things you can live 
with .

You're anxious to get going 

Monday, but don't jump the gun. 
Something you learn by Tuesday

Wednesday and Thursday. Advise 
discretion and guard against gos-

OK to be stubborn then. Every-

soon. Plans may change on Satur-
day, so be fleXible. Hide out and 
read a good book most of Sunday. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)

Ubnt (Sept. 23-0ct. 23) 
- Creativity's challenged on

Thursday is better, due to a new

would shift the balance of power 
from the federal governmen t to the 
states, undermining the idea of a 
federation and central government. 

A third, and more practical 
option, was simply to have the 
president elected by a direct popu-
lar vote, with the candidate receiv-
ing the most votes winning the 
election. While th is might seem to 
many people today as a viable 
option, it was rejected by the 
framers of the Constitution. 

The early citizens of the United 
States were very spread out along 
the East Coast. A national cam-
paign would be very difficult for a 
presidential candidate. The framers 
feared that without sufficient 
knowledge of ca ndidates, some

vote had to be for someone outside 
their home state, in order to pre-
vent electors from voting for their 
home-town candidates. The vice 
president was not elected as a run-
ning mate with the presidential 
candidate. The vice president was 
the person who had the second-
highest total electoral vote in the 
presidential race. 

After the first four presidential 
elections, the Electoral College was 
changed. The Twelfth Amendment 
to the Constitution states that each 
elector only gets one vote for pres-
ident, while the other vote would 
go for the_ vice president. The 
amendment also stipulates that if 
no one receives an absolute major-
ity in the election that the U.S. 
House of Representatives would 
select the president fro m among 
the top three candidates. Also, if no 
candidate received a majority in the 
vice presidential election, then the 
U.S. Senate would select the vice 
president between the top two can-
didates.

The £ledoral 
College has 
undergone several 
different phases 
since its inception in 
Article II, Section 1 
of the Constitution. 

Through the 
years, the Electoral 
College has 
evolved into what 
it is today. While 
the ma nner of 
choosing the elec-
tors is still left up 
to the ·State legis la-
ture, all states now 
have systems 
where the voters 
choose the elec-, election. 

The framers finally decided 011 
the College of Electors. Accordi"ng 
to Kimberl ing, the original idea was 
that the most knowledgeable and 
informed people from each state 
would select the president based on 
merit alone, without any regard for 
his political party or state of origin. 

The structure of the Electoral 
College bares a strong resemblance 
to the Centurial Assembly system 
that was used by the Roman 
Republic. This was no accident, as 
many of the framers were well-
schooled in ancient history. Under 
the ancient Roman system, adult 
males were divided into groups of 
100, called Centuries. These Cen-
turies each had one vote on pro-
posals submitted by the Roman 
Senate. In the Electoral College 
system, the states act as the Cen-
turial groups. 

The Electoral College has 
undergone several different phases 
since its inception in Article n, Sec-
tion 1 of the Constitution. 

The initial model of the Elec-
toral College differed in that the 
initia l electors were not chosen by 
the people on election day, but 
rather by the ind ividual state legis-
latu res. The electors were each 

tors. All states except for Maine and 
Nebraska use direct statewide elec-
tions to choose their electors. 

The Electoral College is not 
without its criticisms, according to 
Kimberling. Among the questions 
raised about the Electora l College 
is the risk of electing a president 
who won the electoral vote but lost 
the popular vote, the risk of "faith-
less" electors who vote fo r a cand i-
date other than the one that they 
are pledged to, the possibi liry of the 
Electoral College discouraging 
people from voting and the col-
lege's failu re to accurately reflect 
the national popular wi ll. 

The current system is not, how-
ever, without its meri ts, according 
to Kimberling. Some arguments for 
the Electoral College that he cited 
are that it requires a distribution of 
popular support to be elected pres-
ident, it enhances the status of 
minority interests and it maintains 
a federal system of government and 
representation . 

That is our system for electing 
the president in a nutshell . Hope-
fully you will be a little more 
informed about the process as you 
shuffle in to the voting booths 
tomorrow.

Dead: 
Dia de WS Muertos is a 
time of celebration 
ContInued from ...,. U 
from candles, copal incense and 
food, among other things. They are 
then thought to remain with the 
living, silently enjoying their com-
pany like in the old days. On the 
evening of Nov. 2, they are thought 
to have left, though some try to 
stay a little longer. These ghosts are 
chased back to their graves by peo-
ple wearing bright and colorful 
masks. 

Performers abound at the 
cemetaries, playing tunes enjoyed 

Decorating gravesites is another 
common tradition. They are often 
painted freshly and covered in 
flowers. Marigolds are used very 
often in covering gravesites, as well 
as to make trails leading to homes. 
This lets the spirits know how to 
get to their friends and family. Peo-
ple hang out at the gravesites, visit-
ing friends, both alive and dead, in 
addi tion to deceased family mem-
bers. 

Other traditions include "pan de 
muertos." a sweet bread made for 
the dead that is placed on the altars. 
The living will often eat the pan de 
muertos the day after the spirits have 
left and contend that it was kissed by 
the dead when they came to visit. 
They say that it tastes a little sweeter 

after the dead have by those who have 
died. People every-
where are happy, 
celebrating with 
mends as well as 
family. The days are 
filled with prayer 
and festivities, a 
mixture of respect 
for the dead and 
the happiness of 
life.

Perhaps one of the most com-
mon traditions is the making.of

although they are seen at the work-
place as well. Altars consist of flow-
ers, candles, pictures of the person

food, water, clothing and things 
that describe the person's person-
ality. For children, there may be 
toys and candy. There is usually a 
candle for each spirit. Religious 
symbols arc also used, such as fig-
urines of Jesus and Mary, and 
crosses. The altars are bright and 
beautiful, as much time is given to 
them by the deceased's friends and 
family.

ings and food. Sugar calaveras are 
seen in many places. Some people 
celebrate the tradition of eating a

The skulls and skeleton:. seen 
everywhere in Mexico are not por-
trayed the way they are here. In 
America, on Halloween, skeletons 
are very dark and foreboding. They 
are something to be feared . In 
Mexico, they are joyful. They are 
often dressed in cenain attire, an 
imitation of life. 

The affection for the dead is 
displayed by the time, effort and 
money put into preparation for the 
dias de los muertos. Decorations 
are very elaborate and heartfelt. 
The respect for the dead is very evi-
dent everywhere one goes.

deal with death, of overcoming 
great loss. The sadness that comes 
with losing a loved one is 
inescapable, but at some point 
there must be acceptance. The 
Mexican days of the dead are a way 
for people to transition from the 
cold feeling of loss to the accep-
tance of death. By feeling that the 
spirits are with you again, you feel 
close to them again and feel their 
warmth. It is not a sad time, 
because the living and the dead are 
reun ite~, which calls for a happy 
celebration with a lot of festivities. 

The tradition is similar to the 
Irish wake, in which after mouring 
the death of someone, .the person's 
friends and family get together to 

drink in celebration ofthe person's 
life. It is a way to gain peace with 
the passing of a loved one. 

A common attitude toward 
death in Mexico is the belief that 
life is suffering, and that death is a 
release from that suffering. Life is 
unpredictable and is filled with 
worry, but will eventually end in a 
liberation from this: death. This is 
why there are such happy attitudes 
toward the days of the dead. The 
dead arc free from this world. 

And so the spirits once again 
leave, sometimes stubbornly, back 
to the world of the dead. They are 
happy to have been back for a day 
to visit, but it is not their world 
anymore, and must return to the 

FEATURES 19 

infinite, and peace between the liv-
ing and the dead is achieved - at 
least for one more year.

last year. 

Against the tritons, she was lit-
tle more than human. 

"We came out today wanting 
to show them we could play up 
with them, if not above them, and 
I think we did that: Cuder said. 

The rest of the first half was 
filled with back-and-forth play, 
with both squads traveling the 
length of the field in an attempt to 
strike blood. 

The second half saw more of 
the same until the final 20 min-
utes. That is when Sonoma 
unleashed its biggest threat. 

UCSD goalkeeper Kami Poma 
came through for the Tritons, 
making save after save during 
clutch time, sealing her team's 
win and the ensuing conference 
title 

"I thought we went to sleep a 
little bit in the last 10 or 15 min-
utes, but that's going to happen 
when a team takes chances and 
throws bodies forward: said 
UCSD head coach Brian 
McManus. "Everything just 
becomes 100 miles an hour. 
That's going to happen. You're 
going to have to accept that and 
get on with it. "

Men:s squad freshmen Julian 
athan and Neil Kalra had the 

fastest times with 34:48 and 35:21 
to place 21 st and 30th, respec-
tively. 

On the women's side, sopho-
more Audrey Sung and fresh-
man Lillian Gardiner turned out 
the top performances for the 
Tritons, with their times of 
24:17 and 24:58, earning them 
24th and 43rd place; respective-
ly. 

Earlier this year, Sonoma and 
UCSD got together for a rumble 
at UCSD. The Tritons were out-
played for most of the game but 
pulled out the win 1-0 in over-
time. 

"Sonoma is a powerhouse up 
north," Cuder said. "The first time 
we played them, we were not 
scared, but unsure of what was 
going to happen. The first game 
they dominated we just weren't 
playing our game." 

There were many differences 
between yesterday'S match and 
the one earlier this year. 

"We decided this time just to 
play," McManus said. "The last 
time we played up there they were 
by far the better team. Tod~y, it 
was always going to be a tight 
game. There was no way someone 
was going to run away and score a 
barrel of goals, and I thought we 
did reasonably well." 

The Tritons played in Division 
III last year, winning the national 
championship. This year, they 
moved to Division II.

"It's been a hard year. They've got 
to keep proving themselves. 
Everyone wants to beat them. 
Nobody wants a team .coming up 
from Division II - no scholar-

Next up for UCSD is the first

Tournament, to be held this 
weekend, time and place to be

The Tritons hope to continue 
making waves. 

"Our coach is amazing," 
Cuder said . "That's all you have 
to say. He takes whatever team 
he has and he makes a winning 
formula out of it and this just 
shows it. You can't say enough 
about him. 

"We came back from winning 
last year in Division III, and we 
wanted to come this far and we 
knew could do it. Coming out

With the loss, UGSD's record

The Tritons must look forward 
to the Western Water Polo Associa-

from now. To be held in Honolulu, 
it is of utmost importance that

sisting of 2 goals and S assists, in 14

UCSD will have to look to 
young, upcoming players such as 
Sean Summers and Ryan Mizumo-
to to hold up the middle of the field 
and be the catalyst for those 
around them. 

With this experience under its 
belt, it is easy to think that UCSD 
will be in the running for not only 
a CCAA Tournament Champi-
onship, but perhaps a NCAA Divi-
sion II Championship. 

The Tritons' final record in their 
inaugural season in Division II was 
11 wins, 5 losses and 2 ties, and 9 . 
wins, 3 losses and 2 ties in league 
play. 

UCSD have an excellent showing 
there and win in order to gain a 
berth into the NCAA tournament

Malibu, Calif. 

UCSD also plays Friday in a 
warm-up match for championships 
against the local "old man's" club, 
Sunset San Diego. Sunset counts

A Tough Weekend Trips up Triton Water Polo 
UCSD flounders in the second half to UC Irvine, giving up nine goals in 10-2 loss 
ByTAlTMIWR 
Associate Sports Editor 

U~SD allowed nine straight 
goals In the second half to visiting 
UC Irvine, losing to the third-
ranked Anteaters 10-2. 

After a defensive gem of a first 
half, the score was tied 1-1 and it 
looked like the eighth-ranked TIi-
tons were going to be able to give 
Irvine a run for its money. 

"I don't think I have ever seen a 
quaner go 0-0 like the first one 
did," said triton head coach Denny 
Harper That was absolutely 
incredible and our guys really did 
a great job out there." 

Starting the second half, UCSD 
even managed to take a brief lead 
on a Justin Wylie goal. That, how-
ever, was all she wrote, as the 
Anteaters took control of the 
game from that point, and in 
effect, shut UCSD down at both 
ends of the pool. 

- - "The wheels just seemed to 
come off near the end of the third 
quarter:' Harper said. · We were 
I!=aning in!o out-front court 
offense and Irvine was taking 
advantage of it." 

The game was really a story of 
two halves. The first half saw per-
fect execution by UCSD, at least 
defensively, as they stymied 
almost evety attempt of Irvine's 
to make inroads into their terri-
tory. 

· We came out more aggressive 
than we have in the past couple of 
weeks," UCSD goalie Glenn 
Busch said. "We were able to hold 
them in the first half: 

The only goal the Anteaters 
could manage in the first half 
came at that 5:24 mark of the sec-
ond quarter. 

The Tritons were not down for

long, as two minutes later Justin 
Wylie, who scored both Triton 
goals on the day, tossed one in to . 
even the score. 

The second half was a disaster 
compared to the first two quarters. 
UCSD seemed to go into a free-
fall with nothing to stop them 
except the final whistle. 

After scoring the first goal of 
the half, mental breakdowns 
plagued UCSD, as they allowed 
nine straight unanswered goals. 

"There were some bad individ-
ual mental breakdowns in the 
game: Harper said. "This is some-
thing we will work on right up 
until we leave for Hawaii." 

While Irvine took its game to 
another level, UCSD floundered, 
searching for the form that had it 
ranked as high as fifth earlier in 
the year. 

The Tritons could not seem to 
get on track offensively in the sec-
ond half and their offensive inepti-

tude led to the Anteaters' counter-
attack and created opportunities 
for Irvine that just should not have 
been there. 

"The team played well today 
and every aspect of the game went 
well," Harper said. "The only 
problem we really had was allow-
ing the Irvine counterattack to 
take over the game in the second 
half:

to him, has been given numerous 
second chances which he has 
squandered, and has just given up. 

After being the king of the base-
ball world, Strawberry fell just as 
fast as he rose. Tax problems were 
only one part of it. There was also 
the cocaine addiction. 

Cocaine kills a person physical-
ly, emotionally and mentally. 

Despite all of this. the Straw man 
was given repeated second chances. 
It's disgusting. If anyone else were 
found with coke as much as Straw-
beny has, that person would have 
,been placed in jail for years, perhaps 
never to be seen again. 

ot so if it 's a star baseball play-
er. 

So some team gives Strawberry 
a chance, he gets caught with coke, 
gets a slap on the wrist along with 
some "rehab," and waits for some 
other team to pi ck him up. It has 
been going back and fot1h this way 
for awhile. He ha s been given every 
opportunity to bounce back, to get 
his life together, yet he keeps using 
drugs. 

Colon cancer, too, is no joke. 
Strawberry is suffering from this 
disease like many others in the 
world. Straw, unlike the masses 
who also have th is cancer, has had 
every opponun ity to fight it. He has 
access to the best doctors with the 
best trea tmen t. He has made 
progress against th e disease: but 
now he seems to have given up. 

Strawberry is a tragic character, 
of which Shakespeare himself 
would be in awe. While it is easy to 
feel sorry for his addictions and for 
his disease, it is also reasonable to 
be angry at the repeated second 
chances and the opportunities he 
has squandered.

Should We 
Have Pity For 
Strawberry? 

Fulton 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

T he legendary Darryl Straw-berry - lie is one of those "what might have been" 
kind of guys. His numbers during 
his early days with the Mets were 
outstandi.ng. He was on pace to 
destroy many career home run 
marks, including the total career 
home run mark. 

On pace, that is. 
At a young age, he was part of a 

World Series champior1ship team, 
the 1986 Mets. He later went on to 
play for the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
signing for what was, at the time, an 
insane amount of money. Straw-
berry was a future Hall-of-Famer 
and a perennial All Star. 

What happened? 
It is hard to say exactly what 

happened, but it culminated last 
week. Strawberry, suffering from a 
double whammy of colon cancer 
and cocaine addiction, revealed 
that he would prefer.o be dead . 

I t is a sad thing to read when a 
baseball hero. a one-time unmis-
takable tigure (for all the right rea-
sons) falls to the point of suicide. 

The question is whether we 
should feel sorry for him. 

I t is almost natural to feel sorry 
for him. It is natural to feel for 
someone who has fallen to the low-
est depths of life. Killing oneself is 
not a laughing matter. It is some-
thing to take seriously, no matter 
who it is. 

Then, upon further considera-
tion of Strawberry's life, why should 
we feel sorry for him? I look at it this 
way: He has had everything handed

UCSD: CCAA Champs! 
Cuder's first-half goal seals the title for the Tritons 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

CARSON, Calif., - You can-
not stop the UCSD women's 
soccer team; You can only hope 
to contain them. 

The Tritons yet again proved 
their dominance yesterday, win-
ning the California COllegiate 
Athletic Association champi-
onship with a 1-0 victory over 
Sonoma State University at Toro 
Field. 

UCSD took the lead in the 
18th minute of the first half. The 
Tritons' Julia Cuder booted a 
corner kick past the ~ossacks 
goalkeeper Kara Stou!. 

"We knew we were pretty 
dominant on corner kicks 
because we have scored a lot 
from them, so every time we do 
get one, everybody gets pumped 
up and excited," Cuder said. 
"On every kick I just try to drive 
it in. On that one, Liz [Hughes] 
made an awesome up-post run 
and she distracted them and it 
just went in ."

nent, 'having been named an

In its first year of competition at 
the Division II level, the UCSD 
men's soccer team could not pull 
off an upset against Sonoma State 
University to advance in the 2000 
California Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation Championship Tourna-
ment. 

The teams faced off on Friday, 
Nov. 3, at the campus of CSU 
Dominguez Hills, the host of the 
event. The previous meeting 
between these two squads resulted 
in a 2-1 loss for the Tritons, as 
freshman Jonathan Costabile 
scored the only goal for UCSD. 

Ryan Blair and Brady Bernard 
returned after suffering injuries 
during the regular season, which 
gave the Tritons better artillery 
against Sonoma State. 

The game was scoreless in the 
first half, which could be accredit-
ed to the time both teams took to 
figure out their game plan in such 
a crucial match. Unfortunately, 
Sonoma State struck first, just 
after four minutes into the second 
half.
