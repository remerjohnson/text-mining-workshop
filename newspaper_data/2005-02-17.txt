Bush calls for Perkins 
Loans cuts in budget 

Savings to increase Pell Grant by 
$500 over five years under proposal 

By MTlICK ALLEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Higher education groups have 
warned that students currently 
receiving Federal Perkins Loans 
could see them cut next year under 
a new budget submitted by 
President George W. Bush. 

On Feb. 7, Bush released his 2006 
budget, recommending the elimina-
tion of the program that provides 
low-interest loans to needy students. 

The funds from the program 
would be used to increase the maxi-
mum Pell Grant awards by $100 per 
year over the nen five yean. The 
grants, which do not have to be 
repaid, are awarded to undergraduate 
students who exhibit financia\ need. 

"The budget achieves $34 bil-
lion in savings over 10 years by 
reducing unnecessary subsidies and, 
payments to lenden, guarantee 

agencies and loan consolidators," 
the presidential budget states. 
"These savings will be used to 
increase the Pell Grant maximum 
award, payoff the current $4.3 bil-
lion Pell shortfall and improve ben-
efits to students in school by 
increasing loan limits for first-year 
students and extending the current 
favorable interest rate framework." 

Currently, almost 3,000 students 
at UCSD qualify for Perkins Loans, 
and receive more than $5.9 million, 
according to University Outreach 
Communications Director Pat 
JaCoby. These students include 
undergraduates as well as graduate 
and professional students who are 
generally ineligible for Pell Grants. 

Several educational groups have 
said that Perkins Loans are impor-
tant to ensure that higher education

Bill to increase UC accountability 
University expresses support of new proposal 

By AMY IFURUNG 
Staff Writer 

The state Legislature is con-
sidering a proposal that would 
require significantly increased 
accountability from California's 
public higher education institu-
tions. 

The biU, proposed on Jan. 27, 
calls for the creation of a statewide 
accountabilIty structure to assess 
the performance of universities 
based on policy goals developed 
by lawmakers. 

"California does not have a 
process in place at the state level 
for overall accountability and 
how well higher education is 
responding to state goals and 
priorities," said Bruce Hamlett, 
chief consultant for the 
Assembly's higher education 
committee. 

The bill was originally written 
by Assemblywoman Carol Liu (D 
- La Caflada Flintridge), chair of 
the higher education committee. 

Her office did not return calls 
seeking comment. 

Liu created the proposal after 
the release of an ini tial report 
from the National Commission 
on Accountability in Higher 
Education,' according to a state-
ment released by her office. She 
serves as a member of the organi-
zation, first created last February 
by the State Higher Education 
Executive Office and funded by 
the Ford Foundation. The com-

mission is chaired by former 
Oklahoma GOY. Frank Keating 
and former South Carolina Gov. 
Richard W. Riley. 

A final report from 'the com-
mission is expected on March 10. 

Her bill will repeal three sec-
tions of the Education Code but 
will also add three subsequent sec-
tions. 

Under the proposal, the state's

2 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN TIiURSDAY,FEBRUARY 17,2005 

I BRIEFLY 
HISS name changed to 

honor Muir provost 
In an official ceremony on Feb. 11, John 

Muir College administrators renamed the audi-
torium at Humanities and Social Science 2250 
in honor of former Muir Provost Patrick J. 
Ledden. Ledden died in October 2003. 

The new Patrick J. Ledden Auditorium recog-
nizes Ledden's work as associate chancellor and 
the second provost of Muir College. Ledden occu-
pied the post of provost from 1967 until his death. 

A mathematician by profession, Ledden also 
expressed great interest in literature and public 
art, supporting the development of interdiscipli-
nary.programs at the college, according to Muir 
Intenm Provost Susan Kirkpatrick. 

"Pat Ledden's mind ranged widely, and his 
most enduring legacy may be seen in his 
beloved students, to whom he communicated 
his enthusiasm for learning." Kirkpatrick stated 
in an e-mail to campus faculty and staff. 

Courses beginning in the spring will list the 
facility unde(its new name on student schedules. 

Three UC researchers 
awarded national medals 
President George W. Bush has named three 

UC researchers among eight recipients of the 
2003 National Medal of Science, the highest 
national honor given to a scientist. 

The medals will be awarded at a White 
House ceremony scheduled for March 14. 

The award will honor UC San Francisco 
Chancellor and Nobel laureate J. Michael 
Bishop for his work in biological scie~ce. The 

. oth~r medals will go to UC Irvine behaVioral sci-
entist R. Duncan Luce and UC Berkeley chemi-
cal englneenng professor John M. Prausnitz. 

'Our lives are enriched by these researchers' 
significant contributions to California, the nation 
and the world: stated UC President Robert C. 
Dynes in a university press release. 'Through 
their innovation and outstanding achievement, 
these individuals have brouilt distinction to 
themselves, their students ana our university~ 

Of the 409 National Medals of Science pre-
sented since the program's inception by 
Congress in 1959, 51 have gone to researchers 
affiliated with the University of California. 

Ten UC engineers elected to 
national· academy 

Of the 74 new members and 11 foreign 
associates elected to the National Academy of 

En~lneenng thiS year, 10 will come from the 
University of California, the , academy 

announced. The number is the most from any 
college or university. 

In the 2005 election, 153 UC faculty and 
researchers will be members of the academy 
which advises the federal government o~ 
issues related to engineerin~ that have major 
economic and social implications. 

"These engineers are to be applauded for 
their remarkable contributions to our nation in 
many areas of engineering." UC President Robert 
C. Dynes stated in a university announcement of 
the election results. 'Their election confirms 
once again the strength of our faculty in mathe-
matics, science and engineering:' 

UCSD professor of bioengineering Geert W. 
Schmid-Schoenbein, elected for discovering the 
activation mechanism of white blood cells, was 
the only winner affiliated with the campus. 

Campus receives S 1.5 
million award for research 

UCSD has received a $1.5 million ~ft from 
structural engineering industry leader Robert E. 

En~ekirk and his wife Natalie to fund research, 
fellowships and scholarships at Jacobs School of 
Engineering. the campus has announced. 

En~ekirk founded En~ekirk Companies, which 
has been credited with structural design in more 
than $100 billion of construction projects, indud-
ing the billion-dollar Getty Center and the 
Hollywood and Hiilland shopping complex. 

The money wai go towaid work at the cam-
pus' new structural research center, the univer-
sity stated in a press release. The gift will lever-
age almost $17 million in federal and state sup-
port for three new testing facilities, induding 
the world's first outdoor shake table, the coun-
try's largest soil-structure interaction facility and 
the world's first blast simulator, which will study 
the effects of bomb explosions. 

Spellings gives first talk on 
higher education 

Department of Education Secretary Margaret 
Spellings offered her first remarks devoted 
exclusively to higher education at the annual 
meeting of the American Council on Education 
on Feb. 14. 

Preserving access to higher education is part 
of President George W. Bush's commitment to 
create an 'ownership society: Spellings said. 

In addition, Spellings said Bush's 2006 budget 
would increase funding for federal financial aid, 
allowing low-income students to attend college. 

Spellings also criticized the Education 
Departmenfs methods for tracking student suc-
cess and said the government needed to find bet-
ter ways to collect that information.

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S_ Meeting '21 - Feb_ 16, 200S 

Public Input 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior Shira 

Stanton told the council about the benefits of 
studying abroad in Israel. Despite the cancel-
lation of the Israeli study abroad program 
due to security risks, Stanton spent her 
junior year anending Tel Aviv University. In 
order to study there, Stanton was required to 
drop her enrollment from UCSD and direct-
ly enroll at TAU. She has since re·enrolled. 

Reports 
PresidentJenn Pae 

Pae reported that she has submitted a 
request for $1,000 from Mandated Reserves 
to hire an attorney to review the pending co-
op lease agreement. 

Pae also reported that the RIMAC Annex 
Building Advisory Committee and the 
RIMAC Advisory Board will soon include 
student representatives in order to comply 
with the Student Conduct Code. Currently, 
each student is paying $92 per quarter for 
RiMAe ~nd C~Ilyonvicw Pool 'Withoul a

John Muir CQUege Freshman Senator 
John Polkinghome 

Polkinghorne reported that the freshman 
senator barbecue will be held Feb. 18 from 
12 p.m. to 2 p.m. on Sun God Lawn. The 

event is meant to allow students to meet 
their representatives. 

Old Business 
Item A 

The council passed a resolution support-
ing study abroad opportunities in Israel. 
The program was suspended on April 2, 
2002 due to increased violence and a travel 
advisory from the state department. The 
A.S. Council asked that the university 
resume the Education Abroad Program in 
Israel as soon as possible . 

The council also urged Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox to direct the International 
Center to draft a legal waiver to allow tu-
dents to study in Israel under the 
Opportunities Abroad Office until EAP 
resumes the program. 

ItemD 
The council approved a symbolic ques-

tion on the ballot for the spri ng quarter 
election. The question will ask srudents if 
they support an A.S. Council that would 
include equal numbers of college-based and 
campus-based rcprC5cntativcs. 

In the same meeting, the council indefi-
nitely tabled or rejected four alternate pieces 
of legislation designed to put the same issue 
before the students using different wording.

Budget: Education groups criticize 
plan, cuts to federal aid programs 

continued from page I 
is accessible to students with financial need. 
The t.Inerican Council on Education, the 
Association of American Universities. and 
other national organizations said that the bud-
get sends a rnixed message to college students . 

"We are heartened that the president has 
made increased Pell Grants and enhanced 
student loans such a prominent part of his 
2006 budget," the groups stated in a joint 
lener. "At the same time, we are disappoint-
ed with other proposals in the president'S 
budget that would eliminate long-standing, 
successful programs that have done a great 
deal to help students and families." 

In addition, srudent organizations like 
the U .S. Student Association said they 
oppose cuts in the presidential proposal. 

"While increasing the maximum Pell 
Grant award is an important part of college 
affordability, the current proposal is mis--
leading," US SA President Ajita Talwalker 
stated. "A modest increase to the Pell 
Grant, while simultaneously attacking the 

other parts of a student's aid package that 
~re necessary for a srudent to go to school, 
IS not educational access." 

The Deparonent of Education, however, 
stated that many of the programs eliminated 
were cut due to redundancy and inefficiency. 

"The president'S budget is a common-
sense approach that would improve the 
effectiveness of the srudent aid programs 
while reducing program COSts and subsidies 
to private lenders," the deparonent stated in 
a press release. "The savings generated from 
the student aid reforms would result in a S 19 
billion investtnent in the Pell Grant program 
over the next 10 years, including the funds 
needed to provide a $500 increase in tile 
maximum award over. the next five years." 

Overall, Bush's proposed budget reduces 
education spending by half a billion dollars . 
The White House press office did not 
return calls seeking comment .

Bill: Plan would increa'se

Grades: Aquarium snack bar posted gain

higher education goals would relate 
to "educational opportunity, prepa-
ration, student success, public ben-
efits and COSt effectiveness," the bill 
states. 

The university is still in the 
process of "evaluating the specifics" 
of the recent bill but has expressed 
its initial support of the idea, 
according to UC Office of the 
President spokeswoman Ravi 
Poorsina . 

"In general, the University of 
California supports the framework 
of a Cali fornia postsecondary edu-
cation accountability structure, 
especially one where the higher 
education segments agree upon the 
most relevant objectives and indi-
cators," Poorsina sta ted in an e-
mail. 

The university also supports the 
important role the bill gives to the 
California Postsecondary 
Education Commission, which 
requires it "to collect information, 
maintain a comprehensive database 
and publish reports on the condi-
tion of the postsecondary educa-
tional ~)'stem," she stated. 

Currently, UC, CSU and com-
munity college campuses must 
compile reports for the Legislature 
on performance on what Section 
99181 of the Education Code calls 
a "regular basis." 

In addition, under the current 
accountability program, the CPEC 
must submit annual progress 
reports to the Legislature and the 
governor. 

The bill, if passed, will require 
the CPEC to report only biannual· 
Iy, but with increased specificity 
regarding certain educational and 
fisca l objectives. 

California currently ranks 46th 
out of the 50 states in the number 

of students who gain bachelor's 
degree after six years of college, 
according to Hamlett. Increasing 
the six-year graduation rate is 
among the goals the bill would 
address, he said. 

"If we don't do anything to 
increase the number of students 
who complete baccalaureate pro-
grams, how will we expect to keep 
competing in the global economy)" 
Hamlett said. 

Liu drafted the bill following 
the creation of the SHEEO's 
accountability commission, which 
supports the idea of greater 
accountabi lity in higher education 
institutions in order for students to 
receive adequate preparation for 
the workforce . 

[n a Jan. 24 speech delivered to 
the Council for Higher Education 
Accreditation, SHEEO Executive 
Director Paul Lingenfelter 
addressed job concerns, citing the 
outsourcing of science and technol-
ogy research occupations as a prob-
lem that needs to be remedied. 
According to Lingenfelter, 38 per-
cent of individuals with Ph.D.s in 
science and technology in the 
United tates come from outside 
the country. 

Lingenfelter said he sees 
greater accountability in education 
as a way to help students fill such 
po itions and provide a source of 
resea rch. 

"We have great higher educa-
tion systems, but the bar has been 
raised due to changes in the world 
and the global economy," 
Lingenfelter said in a later inter-
view. "The standards of achieve-
ment in higher education are much 
higher."

Sierra Summit, Plaza Cafe, 

Earl's Place and Foodworx did not 
receive a letter grade because they 
were evaluated earlier in the quar· 
tcr, before Yorkey adopted the new 
inspection process in November. 

"I don't think the scores that 
you see in our area are indicative of 
what we do," said HDS Associate 
Director of Dining Services Brian 
E. Klippel. "Its not who we are." 

Since the facilities have always 
received scores of 90 or above. 
Klippel said raising the scores back 
up was simply a maner of learning 
the methods of the new health 
inspector, who was hired by the 
university in September, and adjust-
ing to a new inspection format. The 
eateries are already addressing con-
cerns expressed by Yorkey, he said. 

"Anything less is unaccept-
able," Klippel said . "We expect 
that all of our next inspections will 
be in the 90-plus range because we 
have responded to the issues that 
he raised. We are on a quick learn-
ing curve." 

Some campus vendors have 
expressed concern over the lower 
scores, which EHS earlier 
declined to post publicly, accord· 
ing to the department's Safety and 
Risk Manager John D . Schmidt. 

"[Vendors] are concerned that 
the scores are down," he said. 
"Wouldn't you be?" 

However, the decreases in 
scores are not the result of 
increased frequency violations, 
but are instead caused by a new 
calculation method that assigns 
higher penalties for each violation, 
according to Schmidt and Bowers. 

"We're looking for the same 
elements, but they're just graded 
differently," Schmidt said. "That's 
just to meet the state's mandate to 
meet a uniform standard."

SRTV's decision to 
show porn a mistake 

W hile in line with legal requirements and free speech 
protections, the choice by 
Koala editor and A.S. 
Elections Manager Steve 
York to broadcast pornog-
raphy was unfortunate. 

At issue is not indecency 
- York was well within his 
rights - but a lack of 
savvy and strategic deci-
sionmaking. Coming at a 
time when the university is 
in the process of determin-
ing its role in oversight of 
s tudent te levision, the 
video sends a message of 
confrontation that may 
result in a campus crack-
down on studen t expres-
sion . It also strips Student-
Run Television of much of 
its credibility. 

After last year's fi asco, 
when ca mpus ad mini tra-
tors confronted SRTV 
about reports of question-
able, but still legal, content 
- resulting in a temporary 

halt to SRTV broadcasts-
the station asserted that it 
was possibly the victim of a 
break-in. At the time, cur-
rent station manager 
Chelsea Welch said, 
"There is no geni talia 
shown on SRTY." 

In fact, Welch had used 
this vel)' argument in con-
testing the need for a cam-
pus committee created to 
draft policies governing 
student television stations. 
Despite a lack of proof 
other than her assertion 
that the station could not 
have broadcast porn, Welch 
secured $250 in funding 
just this month from 
Associated tudents to pay 
for a security system for the 
station. 

As York's video illus-
trates, SRTV does, in fact, 
show genita lia, which sug-
gests that one of Welcn's 
main arguments against the 
committee was wholly 
disingenuous. 

Council changes must 
be put to students 

A .s. Council senators ~ver~ right to ta.ble leg-IslatJon proposing the 
reduction of the numoer of 
coll ege-based representa-
tives III favor of general rep-
resentatives not connected 
to any particular college. 

Thurgood Marshall 
College Junior Senator 
Kate Pillon was correct -
and brave - in pointing 
out that the quality of cur-
ren t senators is a la rger 
problem than the metllod 
by which they are elected. 
Altering the people within 
the system is a much more 
effective and less drastic 
solution to problems than 
alte ring the entire system. 

The proposal was not 
without ment, however, and 
for this reason it should be 
up to the students to decide 
whether they want to 
change the structure of the 
council. The A. . Council 
should have gone ahead 
with a referendum allowing 
students to vote on how 
they are represented. 

The very introduction of 

this proposal shows a well-
placed concern that current 
council members aren't rep-
resenting their constituen-
cy as well as they should. 
Since, at present, half of the 
senators have been appoint-
ed rather than elected, it is 
apparent that students lack 
representation to begin 
with. Freshman representa-
tion is a particular problem; 
Revelle College Senior 
Senator Ted McCombs 
made a logical argument 
that the proposal would 
elbow out freshman repre-
sentation, but it ca n also be 
said that freshmen don't 
know enough about the 
school or the cou ncil 's pro-
cedures to be effective. 

A fair solution to this 
dilemma should be ham-
mered out, and students 
shou ld vote on it. In the 
meantime, the quick and 
easy way to improve stu-
dent representatIOn on the 
council is for current repre-
sentatives to be proactive 
and persistent in gauging 
students' des ' res.

Full summer sessions worth funding 
Summer options will ease UC's crowding 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Opinion Editor 

UC Berkeley a'ld {lCLA have 
full summer sessions, so why 
don 't we? Many UCSD students 
ask this question as they grudg-
ingly attend five-week summer 
sessions and face limited class 
options and tuition that financial 
aid does not cover. 

Until recently, UCSD seemed 
on track to receive state funds for 
an improved and lengthened 
summer session. Those funds 
\;On't be coming this year, how-
ever, leaving UCSD with only 
half of the state "buyout" this 
year and not enough time to put 
that money toward improving 
the 2005 summer session . 

Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Education Mark 
Appelbaum cried to put an opti-
mistic spin on the events, saying 
that "a student attending sum-
mer ession three years from 
now" will enjoy "a first-rate sum-
mer ' session" at UCSD. That's 
exactly what UCSD should be 
shooting for, but it's merely a 
pipe dream at this point. 

Students spending their sum-
mers at UCSD currently face 
limitations in library hours, class 
offerings, shuttle services and 
other studen t services we take for 
granted during the school year 
- not to mention a dead cam-
pus, since summer session is 
unattractive to all but those 
forced to take summer classes 

because of their four-year plans, 
double majors or other academic 
concerns. 

. ~ ir number of UCSD 5tu-
dents attend UC Berkeley and 
UCLNs summer sessions, but an 
equi table exchange with UC 
Berkeley and UCLA students 
isn't happening, because UCSD's 
summer session isn 't comparable 
to theirs. A full summer session 
at UCSD would draw in UC stu-
dents from all campuses, easing 
the number of students necessi-
tating UC Berkeley and UCLA's 
fu ll summer sessions. 

The sooner university offi-
cials develop a uniform summer 
session across all UC campuses, 
the better. Only then will UC 
students be able to fully reap the 
benefits of attending a university 
with campuses spanning the state 
and fully transferable UC credits 
- summer is the perfect time to 
temporari ly try out a different 
campus and a different set of 
professors and classmates with-
out the commitment of going 
abroad. 

Buying out UC summer ses-
sions is also an important way to 
keep the various campuses on 
par with each other. Appelbaum 
let it slip that the state's buyout 
of summer sessions at UCLA 
and UC Berkeley led to "a gross 
inequity between UC campus-
es." UC administrators must 
force themselves to curtail build-
ing up those two campuses at the 
expense of other campuses 

before one or more UC ca mpus 
loses standing because of 
neglect. 

A r..!H sum:ner scs5ion ;vould 
also ease academic burdens on 
students and affirm UC adminis-
trators' supposed commitment to 
undergraduate education. With 
graduation goals and a practical-
ly useless summer session, it's not 
unusual for UCSD students to 
go way over quarterly unit caps, 
taking five or even six classes a 
quarter. Havi ng a full range of 
academic options wou ld a suage 
overcrowding during the year as 
well as ease undue stress on stu-
dents with lofty academic goals. 

When UC President Robert 
C. Dynes talked to the Guardiuu 
on Jan. 24, he pointed out that 
full summer sessions a re a cost-
effective way to expand student 
access. T hey use existi ng facili -
ties, and as Dynes said, " It does-
n't change the student-to-faculty 
ratio, and it doesn't delete the 
quality and the student services 
that you 're going to want." 

That's worth pondering as 
UCSD puts up multimillion -dol-
lar buildings in Earl Warren 
College and UC Merced opens 
for business this fa ll. Building 
more facilities fo r an increasing 
number ofUC students is a good 
long-term solution, but also an 
expensive o ne that takes years to 
Come to fruition and doesn't take 
advantage of existi ng resources

Porn, Democrats and student government. That's. the last two weeks in a nutshell. 
First comes the porn. On Feb. 3, 

Student-Run Television ai red a 
homemade pornographic video as 
part of its weekly "Koala TV" show. 

When the old "Koala TV" hosts 
aired a similarly explicit video on 
SRTV a few years ago, the show 
was pulled by tlle administration -
not for indecency ' reasons, but 
rather copyright concerns. T he 
smUl, it seemed, was a copyrighted 
work. Even though the Federal 
Communications Commission's 
copyright guidelines do not apply to 
closed-circuit stations like SRTY, 
the snldent-run station's own sel f-
imposed governing documents for-
bid the use of copyrighted material 
without consent of the owner. 

Ths time, the hosts of "Koala 
TV" dove through a grotesquely 
unthinkable loophole: Gain the 
copyright to a porn video by pro-
ducing, directing and tarring in it 
themselves. 

Th.It's what they did, unfuffil-
n:Jtely fo\' the now-scarred retinas 
of on-campus residents, who inno-
cently flipped 011 SRTV late one 
cold February night. Expecting to 
see the highly acclaimed "Laundry 
Vision" or "Ntr. Rogers Puppet 
Show" ski ts, they in~tead were 
treated ro what the male star of the 
show dubbed "ama teur, amateur 
pornography." (Rumo rs of the 

woman being a "hired actress" are 
false, according to her male coun-
terpart.) 

That unlikely star? The Koala's 
own editor and the man in charge of 
this spring's A.S. elections, Steve 
York. 

York has been planning his X-
rated debut for a while now. The 
show, which doubled as an ad for 
weekly Koala recruitment meetings, 
wi ll be the first of many; he has said. 

Interestingly, barely a peep was 
heard from the 
administ ration 
regarding the 

" 

nence during the 2004 presidential 
election because of MoveOn.org 
and Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, 
two political action groups that 
managed to carpet-bomb swing 
states with ads blasting the oppos-
ing candidate. 

DAC is also a registcre8 student 
organization - a legally separate 
entity from the national DAC 
group that is registered with the 
federal government. As probably 
the first "527" to be born ofUCSD 

footage. Copyrights 
obtained? Check. All 
other SRTV rules 
followed? Check. 
Nothing else mat-
tered, unlike last 
year, when SRTV 
was shut down for 
airing a few seconds' 
worth of low-quality

month. 

T he group's 
Web site is 
bttp:llwww.dtmo-
CTati,cOIIlitioll.crnn, 
where, it's worth 

footage from a Tijuana strip club. 

N ationally, the biggest Democratic Pany develop-ment in the last couple of 
weeks is Howard Dean's clinching 
of the Democra tic National 
Committee chairmanship. On cam-
pus, it's either the successful sales of 
"Thnk Blue 200S" wristbands by 
the College Democrats or the 
founding of a new studenr-run 
political action ·group. Currently 
registered as a political "527" com-
mittee;: ,vith the San Diego County 
Registrar of Voters, the Democratic 
Action Committee was founded by 
Earl Warren College freshman Alex 
Miller in order to "take a new 
approach to liberal values" and 
'\tand up for wh:1t we believe in." 

"527" groups gained promi -

noting, the 
deputy media analyst listed is 
Warren College Television's repre-
sentative to the Closed-Circuit 
Television Governance Committee, 
Ben Sumner. There are probably 
less than 200 truly poli tically active 
students on this campus, and they 
manage to do everything. 

A t least 30 of those politically active students sit on the A.S . Council, which last 
week turned down a proposal to 
reform the sntdent government 
into ~omcthing more representa-
tive. The proposal would have 
transfo rmed the A.S. Senate, whose 
membership is currently composed 
of four senators from each college, 
into a body with at least half of its 
members elected not by individual 
college but by the campus as a 

whol.e. 
Current senators represent only 

vaguely cohesive constiment 
groups: Thurgood Marshall 
College -juniors, for example, or 
John Muir College seniors. The 
differences between a Marshall 
junior and a Muir senior arc negli-
g ible: Both live off campus, both are 
mostly fini hed with their GE 
requirements and neither really 
care about the student government 
anyway. 

Electing senators at large, as 
student governments from UC 
Davis to UCLA have done for 
years, would encourage senators to 
cater to constituents that actually 
h ave something in common with 
each other. It could be the begin-
ning of a new, more relevant 
Senate, one with a pro-affirmative 
action senator, a Greek senator, an 
engineering senator or a screw-
them-all-Iet's-spend-our-money-
on-golf-carts senator - all of 
whom are actual senators repre-
senting actual constituent groups 
at UC Berkeley. 

The senator from the "Defend 
Affirmative Action Party," was dis-
q ualified in last year's elections for 
badgering members of UC 
Berkeley's judicial council. She 
appealed the ruling by the council 
a ll the way up to the federal courts, 
where she eventually reached a 
settlement this past week, costing 
the student government $1 ,000 
in legal fees. 

That's one of the problems 
with elected officials who have to 
appeal to narrower groups of peo-
ple: T hey tend to be a bit on the 
radical side.

To ease the e nro llment cru nch 
that UC currently faces due to an 
ever-i ncrea si ng number of stu-

cent of graduating California hi gh 
school classes and are thus guar-

tem, a range of solutions must be 
offered. Expanding facil i ties is 
one; funding fu ll summer sessions 
is an other. With UCSD as th e ris-
ing star of the UC system, we 
more than de erve a full summer 
session in 2006. 

The bottom line is that 
UCSD's summer session i 
nowhere ncar what it sho uld be 
for a uni versity of our standing. 
Rather than being taken over by 
youth camps over the su mmer, the 
UCSD campus should be the stu-

improve the standing of the uni-

SRTV's decision to 
show porn a mistake 

While in line with legal requirements and free speech 
protections, the choice by 
Koala editor and A.s. 
Elections Manager Steve 
York to broadcast pornog-
raphy was unfortunate. 

At issue is not indecency 
- York was well within his 
rights - but a lack of 
avvy and strategic deci-

sionmaking. Coming at a 
time when the university is 
in the process of determin-

student television, the 
video sends a message of 
confrontation that may 
result in a campus crack-
down on student expres-
sion . It also strips Student-
Run Television of much of 
its credibility. 

After last year's fiasco, 
when campus administra-
tors confronted SRTV 
about reports of question-
able, but sti ll legal, content 
- resulting in a temporary 

halt to SRTV broadcasts -
the station asserted that it 
was possibly the victim of a 
break-in. At the time, cur-
rent station manager 
Chelsea Welch said, 
"There is no genita lia 
shown on SRTY." 

In fact, Welch had used 
this very argument in con-
testing the need for a cam-
pus committee created to 
draft policies govern ing 
student television stations. 
Despite a lack of proof 
other than her assertion 
that the station could not 
have broadcast porn, Welch 
secured $250 in funding 
just th is month from 
Associated Students to pay 
for a security system for the 
station. 

As York's video illus-
trates, SRTV does, in fact, 
show genitali a, which sug-
gests that one of Welcl1's 
main arguments against the 
co mmittee was wholly 
disingenuous. 

Council changes must 
be put to students 

A .s. Council senators were right to table Ie -islation proposing t~e 
reduction of the number of

Thurgood Marshall

Altering the people within

altering the entire system. 

The proposal was not 
without merit, however, and 
for this n:ason it should be 
up to the smdents to decide 
whether they want to 
change the structure of the

Full summer sessions worth funding 
Summer options will ease UC's crowding

n't change the student-tO-faculty 
ra tio, and it doesn't delete the 
quality and the student services 
that you're going to want." 

That's worth pondering as 
UCSD puts up multimillion -dol-
lar buildings in Earl Warren

more facilities for an increasing 
number of UC studen t~ is a good 
long- term solution, but also an

Porn, Democrats and student government. That's . the last two weeks in a nutshell . 
First comes the porn. On Feb. 3, 

Student-Run Television aired a 
homemade pornographic video as 
part of its weekly "Koala 'TV' show. 

When the old "Koala TV" hosts 
aired a similarly explicit video on 
SRTV a few years ago, the show 
was pulled by the administration -
not for indecency ' reasons, but 
rather copyright concerns. The 
smut, it seemed, was a copyrighted 
work. Even though the Federal 
Communications Commission's 
copyright guidelines do not apply to 
closed-circuit stations like SRTY, 
the student-run station's own self-
imposed governing documents for-
bid the use of copyrighted material 
wirllOut consent of the owner. 

' nus time, the hosts of "Koa la 
'TV' dove through a grotesquely 
unthinkable loophole: Gain the 
copyright to a porn video by pro-
ducing, directing and starring in it 
themsel ves. 

' [1,at's what they did, unfort~­
nately for the now-scarred retinas 
of on-campus residents, who inno-
cently flipped on RTV late one 
cold February night. Expecting to 
see the highly acclaimed "Laundry 
Vision" or "Mr. Rogers Pupper 
Show" skits, they in~tcad wcre 
treated to what the male tar of the 
show dubbed "amateur, amateur 
pornography." (Rumors of the 

woman being a "hired actress" are 
false, according to her male coun-
terpart.) 

That unlikely star' The KoakJ 's 
own editor and the man in charge of 
this spring's A.S. elections, Steve 
York. 

York has been planning his X-
rared debut for a while now. The 
show, which doubled as an ad for 
weeki>, KoakJ recruitment meetings, 
will be the first of many, he has said. 

Interestingly, barely a peep was 
heard from the 
ad m inistratio n 
regarding the 

" 

nence during the 2004 presidential 
election because of MoveOn.org 
and Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, 
two political action groups that 
managed to carpet-bomb swing 
states with ads blasting the oppos-
ing candidate. 

DAC is also a registereil student 
organization - a legally separate 
entity from the nacional DAC 
group that is registered with the 
federal government. As probably 
the first "527" to be born ofUCSD 

footage. Copyrights 
obtained? Check. Al l 
other SRTV rules 
followed? C heck. 
Nothing else mat-
tered, unlike last 
year, when SRTV 
was shut down for 
airing a few seconds'

ment of the 
month. 

The group's 
Web site is 
http://www.dnno-
frariccOIlIition.cum, 
where, it's worth 

footage from a Tijuana strip club. 

N ationally, the biggest Democratic Party develop-ment in the last couple of 
weeks is Howard Deans clinching 
of the Democratic National 
Committee chairmanship. On cam-
pus, it's either the successful sales of 
"Thok Blue 2008" wristbands by 
the ollege Democrats or the 
founding of a new student-run 
political action 'group. Currently 
registered as a political "527" com-
mittee \\~th the San Diego County 
Registrar of Voters. the Democratic 
Action Committee was founded by 
Enrl ,"Vanen College freshman Alex 
Mil ler in order to "take a new 

~pproach to liberal values". a~d 
stand up for what we belteve m. 

"527" groups gained prom i-

noting, the 
deputy media analyst listed is 
Warren College Television's repre-
sentative to the Closed -Circuit 
Television Governance Committee, 
Ben Sumner. There are probably 
less than 200 truly politically active 
stuJents on thi s campus, and they 
manage to do everything. 

A t least 30 of those politica lly active students si t on the A.S. Council, which last 
week turned down a proposal to 
reform the student government 
into something more repre enta-
tive. . rhc proposal would have 
transformed the A.S. Senate, whose 
membership is currently composed 
of four senators from each college, 
into a body with at least half of its 
members elected not by individual 
colleges but by the campus as a 

whole. 
Current enators represent only 

vaguely cohesive constituent 
groups: Thurgood Marshall 
College juniors, for example, or 
John Muir College seniors. The 
differences between a Marshall 
junior and a Muir senior are negli -
gible: Both live off campus, both are 
mostly finished with their GE 
requirements and neither really 
care about the student government 
anyway. 

Electing senators at large, as 
student governments from UC 
Davis to UCLA have done for 
years, would encourage senators to 
cater to constituents that actually 
have something in common with 
each other. It could be the begin-
ni ng of a new, more relevant 
Senate, one with a pro-affirmative 
action senator, a Greek senator, an 
engineeri ng senator or a screw-
them-a ll-let's-spend-our-money-
on-golf-carts senator - all of 
whom are actual senators repre-
senting actual constituent groups 
at UC Berkeley. 

The senator from the " Defend 
Affirmative Action Party," was dis-
qua lified in last year's elections for 
badgering members o f UC 
Berkeley's judicial council. She 
appealed the ruling by the council 
all the way up to the federa l couTtS, 
where she eventually reached a 
serrlement this past week, costing 
the student government $15,000 
in legal fees. 

T hat's one of the problems 
with elected officials who have to 
appeal to narrower groups of peo-
ple: They tend to be a bit on the 
radical si de.

SRTV's decision to 
sh"ow porn a mistake 

While in line with legal requirements and free speech 
protections, the choice by 
Koala editor and A.S. 
Elections Manager Steve 
York to broadcast pornog-
raphy was unfortunate. 

At issue is not indecency 
- York was well within his 
rights - but a lack of 
savvy and strategic deci-
sionmaking. Coming at a 
time when the university is 
in the process of determin-
ing its role in oversight of 
stude nt televi sio n, the 
video sends a message of 
confro ntation that may 
result in a campus crack-
down on smelent expres-
sion. It also strips Student-
Run Television of much of 
its credibi lity. 

After last year 's fiasco, 
when ca mpus a'dministra-
tors confronted SRTV 
about reports of question-
able, but till legal, content 
- resulting in a temporary 

halt to SRTV broadcasts-
the station asserted that it 
was possibly the victim of a 
break-in. At the time, cur-
rent station manager 
Chelsea Welch said, 
"There is no genita lia 
shown on SRTV" 

In fact, Welch had used 
this very argument in con-
testing the need for a cam-
pus committee created to 
draft policies governi ng 
student television stations. 
Despite a lack of proof 
other than her assertion 
that the station could not 
have broadcast porn, Welch 
secured $2 SO in funding 
just this month from 
Associated Students to pay 
for a security system for the 
station. 

As York's video illus-
trates, SRTV does, in fact, 
show genitalia, which sug-
gests that one of Welch 's 
main arguments against the 
committee was wholly 
disingenuous. 

Council changes must 
be put to students 

A .s. Council senators ~er~ right to ta.ble leg-Islaoon proposmg the 
reduction of the numoer of 
college-based representa-
tives 10 favor of general rep-
resentatives not connected 
to any particular college. 

Thurgood Marshall 
College Junior Senator 
Kate Pillon was correct -
and brave - in pointing 
out that the quali ty of cur-
rent senators is a larger 
problem than the method 
by whi ch they are electeJ . 
Altering the people within 
the system is a much more 
effective and less drastic 
soluti on to problems than 
altering the enti re system. 

The proposa l was not 
without ment, however, and 
for this reason it should be 
up to the students to decide 
wh ether they want to 
change the structure of the 
council. The .S. Council 
should have gone ahead 
with a referendum allowing 
sruden (s to vote en how 
they are represented. 

The very introduction of 

this propo al shows a well-
placed concern that current 
council members aren't rep-
resenting their constituen-
cy as well as they shou ld. 
Since, at present, half of the 
senators have been appoint-
ed rather than elected, it is 
apparent that srudents lack 
representation to begin 
with. Freshman representa-
tion is a particular problem; 
Revelle College Senior 
Senator Ted McCombs 
made a logical argument 
that the proposal would 
elbow out freshman repre-
sentation, but it can also be 
said that freshmen don't 
know enough about the 
school or the council's pro-
cedures to be effective . 

A fair solution to this 
dil emma should be ham-
mered out, and students 
shou ld vote on it. In the 
meantime, the quick and 
easy way to improve stu-
dent representatIOn on the 
council is for current repre-
sentatives to be proactive 
and persistent in gauging 
students'desi res.

Full summer sessions worth funding 
Summer options will ease UC's crowding 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Opinion Editor 

UC Berkpley and UCLA have 
full summer sessions, so why 
don't we? Many UCSD stude nts 
ask this question as they grudg-
ingly attend five-week summer 
sessions and face limited class 
options and tuition that financial 
aid does not cover. 

Until recently, UCSD seemed 
on track to receive state funds for 
an improved and lengthened 
summer session . Those funds 

\~on't be coming this year, how-
ever, leaving UCSD with on ly 
half of the state "buyout" this 
year and not enough time to put 
that money toward improving 
the 2005 summer session. 

Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Education Mark 
Appelbaum tried to put an opti-
mistic spin on the events, saying 
that "a student attending sum-
Iller ession three years from 
now" will enjoy " 3 first-rate sum-
mer ' sessio n" at UCSD. That's 
exactly what UCSD should be 
shooting for, but it's merely a 
pipe dream at this point. 

Students spending their sum-
mers at UCSD currently face 
limitations in library hours, class 
offerings, shuttle ervices and 
other student services we take for 
granted during the school year 
- not to mention a dead cam -
pus, since summer session is 
unattractive to all but those 
forced to take summer elasses 

because of their four-year plans, 
double majors or other academic 
concerns. 

A. fai r numhcr of UCSD stu 
dents attend UC Berkeley and 
UCLNs summer sessions, but an 
equitable exchange with UC 
Berkeley and UCLA studen ts 
isn't happening, because UCSD's 
summer session isn't comparable 
to theirs. A full summer session 
at UCSD would draw in UC stu-
dents fro m all campuses, easing 
the number of students necessi-
tating UC Berkeley and UCLA's 
full summer sessions. 

The sooner l llliversity offi-
cials de velop a uniform summer 
session across all UC campuses, 
the better. Only then will UC 
students be able to fully reap the 
benefits of attending a un.iversity 
with campuses spanning the state 
and fully transferable UC credits 
- summer is the perfect time to 
temporarily try out a different 
campus and a di fferent set of 
professors and classmates with -
out the commitment of going 
abroad. 

Buying out UC summer ses-
sions is also an important way to 
keep the various campuses on 
par with each other. Appelbaum 
let it slip that the state's buyout 
of summer sessions at UCLA 
and UC Berkeley led to "a gross 
inequity between tIC campus-
es." UC administrators must 
fo rce t hemselves to curtai l bui ld-
ing up t hose two campuses at the 
eKpense of other campuses 

before one or more UC campus 
loses standing because of 
neglect. 

A fun surnmcr !:C55icn ·.-;culd 
also ease academic burdens on 
sntdents and affirm UC adminis-
trators' supposed commitment to 
undergraduate education. With 
graduation goals and a practical-
ly uselcss sUlllmer session, it's not 
unusual for UCSD students to 
go way over quarterly unit caps, 
taking five or even six classes a 
quarter. Having a full range of 
academic options would assuage 
overcrowding during th e year as 
well as ease undue stress on stu-
dents with lofty academic goals. 

When UC President Raben 
C. Dynes talked to the Guardian 
on Jan. 24, he pointed out that 
full summer sessions arc a cost-
effectjve way to expand student 
access. They use existing facili-
ties, and as Dynes said, "It does-
n't change the student-to-faculty 
ratio, and it doesn 't delete the 
quali ty and the student services 
that you're going to want." 

That's worth pondering as 
UCSD putS up multimillion -dol-
lar bui ldings in Earl Warren 
College and UC Merced opens 
for business this fall . Building 
more facilities fo r an increasing 
number of UC students is a good 
long-term solution, but also an 
expensive one that takes years to 
tome to fruition and doesn't take 
advantage of existing resources

Chadwick stated in a D ec. 8 e-mail 
to chmidt. "EHS has previously 
enjoyed a good re putation fo r 
working with departments , findin g 
out what departments wanted to 
do, educating and helping them 
achieve their goals. Is it now: Let's 
blindside them and shut down their 
operatio ns?" 

In an interview, Chadwick said 
hiS e- mail was an emotional one that 
probahly exaggerated his concerns. 

" It was a little di fferent styl e of 
,Issc,smcnt and we were not quite 
prepared fo r that style whcn D arryl 
lOok over his position," Chadwic k 
aie/. "But we've (adapted] to it. 

T hey arc standards that, qu ite 
fr ankly, we \Ve ren't as fami liar wi th 

as we could have been." 
Among the violati ons noted in 

the inspections, Chadwick said he 
was most upset by Yorkey's order to 
"cease and desist" the preparation 
of soup and barbecues at the fa cili -
ty's outdoor coffee carr. 

"My biggest problem is that the 
changes were demanded on short 
notice," Chadwick said. "It's not that 
I disagree that we shouldn 't be doing 
this, it's just that I did feel blindsided, 
there is no question about it." 

Schmidt said the department 
had probably erred by instituting 
the new program in a single quarrer 
without allowing for a phase-i n 
peri od to allow ea teries to adjust, 
though he said he objected to the e-
mai l's suggesti on that Yorkey was to 
bl ame. 

"To just thro w a whole new pro-
gram at them and change the rules 
ove rnight is pretty radi ca l and 
probably unreasonable, if it was 
taken to a court," Schmidt said. 
"[C hadwick's] perception was that 
it's Darryl. Well , it's not Darryl, it's 
the new tool. " 

"Historical perspective" in doubt 
In an e-mail response to 

Chadwick sent on Dec. 8, Schmidt 
stated th.at part of the problem was 
a three-year lack of a full - time cam-
pus health inspector. 

"The regulations have changed 
over the years , and our extended 
vaca ncy in th is position - three 
years - prccluded us from being as 
vigi lant as we should have been in 
the area of health ins pections," 
Schmidt's e-mai l stated. "D arryl is 
very thorough , which we encour-
age, but does not yet have the ben-
efit of our historical perspective." 

T he reference to the "historical 
perspective," Sch midt said in an 
interview, was not describing the 
de partment 's relationship to the 
faci li t ies but specific st atutory 

exclusions that allow older facili -
ties, to be exempt from certain 
health regulations. 

"Darryl wasn't familiar with that 
section," Schmidt said. "He is a lit-
tle bit more junior than we are." 

In particular, the e-mails indi -
cate that Schmidt and Yorkey dis-
agreed over whether the health 
code prohibited the RIMAC cart 
from serving barbecues. Though 
Yorkey maintained that an outside 
grill was prohibited by the code, 
Schmidt issued a waiver allowing 
for the operation of the barbecue to 
resume in the middle of February. 

Because state regulations allow 
for operations of grills "in conjunc-
tion" with permanent fa cilities, 
Schmidt said he considered the 
barbecue part of the sports facility's 
inside concession areas, not part of 
the cart that sold the food on the 
grill and collected payment. 

In addition, Yorkey noted 
"extreme" - underlined twice -
accumulation of dirt and debris 
throughout Price Center Catering. 
The records indicate that the viola-
tion had not been addressed since 
January 2003, when it was first 
noted. 

"Dirty floors are not what I con-
sider a major risk factor," Bowers 
said, explaining that though EHS 
had previously shut down facilities 
for noncompliance, the department 
would not pursue the same route 
with the eatery. 

Since Yorkey had just begun 
work for the university, there was 
no way for him to prove tha t the 
dirt he found on his inspection was, 
in fact, the same dirt noted in earli -
e r in pections, according to 
Schmidt. 

"They can clea n it tomorrow 
and we ca n come back a quarter 
later and it could be ditty aga in ," he 
said . "[t 's very difficult to gauge 
that it's three years' worth of dirt or 

three days' worth of dirt. Darryl 
doesn't have the historical perspec-
tive to gauge that it's three years 
worth of dirt, and I suspect it's 
not." 

Bowers, who inspected the facil -
ity prior to Yorkey's hiring, said he 
did not recall whether the debris he 
witnessed in previous visits 
remained the same from quarter to 

quarter. 
Though the catering facility has 

already hired a new clea ning crew 
to addre s the probl em , HDS 
Associate Director o f Retail 
Services All an V Moloney said he, 
too, lacks the historical perspective 
to explain why it took twO years for

Health: Department may have 
violate~ state law, Schmidt says 

concinued from page 6 
the department to get the floors 
cleaned. 

"[ don't know, because I haven 't 
been here for two years," Moloney 
said. 

Department slow to comply 
Despite customer complaints 

over RIMAC's decision to stop 
serving soup to meet the conditions 
of Yorkey's order, and a resulting 
drop in business, Chadwick said his 
concern was nor over compliance 
but over timing. 

" Ultimately, our goal is the 
same, it really is," he said. "It's just 
a matter of how you get there. It 
was our goal to always comply, but 
we wanted to have time to react to 
it without affecting our Customer 
service." 

In order to meet specific 
demands in the health code, 
RIMAC carried out a full recon-
struction of one of its concession 
areas, converting a stand into a full 
kitchen that includes a water 
heater, full wall enclosures and a 
three-compartment sink. The 
changes, paid for out of the facili-
ty's revenue and performed over 
winter break, were probably not as 
well-planned as they could have 
been, according to Chadwick. 

"I think we went as fast as we 
possibly could," he said, explaining 
that the pressure might have forced 
administrators to rush through the 
planning process. 

two-year waiting period to give 
vendors more time to comply 
because the department had not 
complied with the state's timeline, 
which would have required the ini-
tial introduction of a standardized 
ifjspection format in January 2002. 

At the time, EHS had taken a 
budget cut and had to layoff its 
permanent field inspector, accord-
ing to Schmidt. 

"We had to make a corporate 
decision: Do we put our resources, 
which we don't have, into stan-
dardizing to meet every letter of 
the law, or are we going close 
enough ro what they're after?" he 
said. "We just made a decision, out 
of cost, that once we filled that 
vacancy, we'd have the new inspec-
ror study this and make it a pro-
ject. And that unfortunately didn't 
materialize until 2004, when 
Darryl arrived . n 

Schmidt didn't directly com-
ment on whether the department's 
decision violated section 516-1 of 
the campus' Procedure and Policy 
Manual, which requires EHS to 
comply with accepted standards 
and regulations. 

"J guess we were in violation of 
that one law, but there are thou-
sands of regulations that we are in 
compliance with," he said . "Is any-
one ever 100 percent in compli-
ance? That's the question. We 
weren't in compliance with this 
specific model, but we've had a 
model that incorporated all of the 
elements since 1965," 

Yorkey declined to comment, 
referring questions to Schmidt and 
Bowers. The California 
Department of Health did not 
return calls seeking comment.

College play celebrates official 
demise of racial segregation 

Faculty-written 'Haunting of Jim Crow' 
to be presented by MCASD La Jolla 

By JESSICA HORTON 
Contributing Writer 

A nnivcrsarie often lead us down the path of introspection. ]n the compari-son of a present n10ment to one past, 
questions are inevitably rai ed of what tri-
umphs - and setbacks - have marked the 
time in between. This yea r marks the 50th 
anniversary of the hi storic upreme Court 
ruling in B"own us. BOQ1·d of Edl/clltion that 
deemed racial segregation in schools 
unconstitutional and marked a turning 
point for race relations in America . 10 take 
a fresh look at the legacy of this momen-
tous event, Thurgood Marshall College has 
commissioned the production of a new play 
by Alan Havis of the theatre and dance 
department to be pre ented at the Mu eum 
of Contemporary Art, an Diego. 

"The I-Jaunting of Jim Crow" reflects on 
the historical struggle for racial imegration 
during the Eisenhower 
years in light of a contem-
porary world that remain

H: Thurmond's paradoxical life may be the 
best metaphor of America' madne s about 
racial superiority :lIld the inner drives to 
embrace "the Otht'r." 

G: Your chara'.:ter, Leza, a contemporary 
Los Angeles high school teacher, says at 
one point, "My kids in elas never heard the 
name Jim Crow, never heard of Jim Crow 
laws, or Jim Crow schools." Do you share 
Leza's apparent concern about the state of 
modern education? 

H: I share Leza's reservations and concern 
about the incomplete historical foundation 

in our public and private 
schools. The younger gen-
erations fail to recall enough 
recent civic tudies, ad to "haunted" by inequality. 

The emotional drama of 
the play - the affectionate 
secret relationship between 
the notoriously raci t 
southern Sen . Strom 
Thurmond and his biracial 
daughter, Essie Mac 
Williams - spans the timc 
berween Brown and the pre-
sent and raises many ques-
tions about the persever-
ance of ambivalent attitude 
toward race in the United 
States. What does it mean 
for one of America's 
staunchest opponents 0' 
civil rights to celebrate his 
lOOth birthday in office? 

I wish the younger 
people would care

ple would ca re more, but

Has America truly "progressed" or has our 
racial backwardness merely been ignored 
and obscured, taking on a new paradoxical 
form? 

Ln an interview with the Guardinn, Havis 
discusses ideas that helped shape the writ-
ing of "The Haunting of Jim Crow." 

G1uIrdia,,: The characterization of great 
historical figures in the arts is a challenging 
and often controversial undertaking. What 
tools helped you breathe life into such an 
impressive cast? 

Havis: Reading many historical biogra-
phies helped bring life and vi tality to the 
leey players of the story. [also remember 
many film clips and news reports over the 
decades. 

G: At times the script of "The Haunting" 
seems quite optimistic with regard to the 
changes that have taken place in America-
and then again, there is plenty of material 
to cast doubt on the true progress that has 
been made.on issues of race. Where do you 
faU on this spectrum? 

, 

H: I have many conflicted feelings of how 
society has evolved with regard to race and 
class differences. I believe we have moved 
forward, but there is strong evidence of our 
nation's need to regress. 

G: Would you say, then, that the contradic-
tions that emerge in Strom Thurmond's 
character reflect broader trends in America?

who add resses a class of high school stu -
dents. r also understand that the show is 
being promoted as an educational tool. 
Were you writing with a particular audi -
ence in mind? 

H: ] wrote the play for a general audience, 
but I knew that layering the drama with 
ome attuned narrative would give context 

to younger audiences. 

G: Do you think that the racial themes of 
the play will resonate with UCSD students' 

H: Yes, even though our racial and cultural 
make-up here is very different than Little 
Rock, Arle. in '57. We do need to recruit 
more African-American students, since 
UCSD falls short compared to UCLA's 
numbers. 

G: What will be the fate of Jim Crow's 
ghost in the next 50 years? 

H: My wish would be that Jim Crow in 
2055 would disappear finally as Am(!rica 
becomes a truly blended, fair-minded soci-
ety - a family under one roof and not two.

3 Doors Down 
Seventeen Days 

Universal 

** 

In the world of adult' al ternative, Matchbox 20 has its Rob Thomas, 
Nickelback has its Chad 
Kroeger and 3 Doors 
Down has ... well ... that 
guy from 3 Doors Down. 

Despite the fact that 
Brad Arnold will never be 
a household name, he and 
his fellow bandmembers 
have sold 12 million 
records since springing up 
from the mud of their 
Mississippi hometOwn in 
2000 with multiformat 
megahit "Kryptonite." 

Seventet1l Days, their 
new record, showcases 
just how these moody 
rockers could achieve 
such success without rely-
ing on a single drop of 
charisma. 

The lyrics are usually 
too repetitive to say 
much, delivered in bite-
sized pieces such as "You 
love me but you don't 
know who I am" from 
"Let Me Go," the forget-
tably pleasant lead single. 

The album's stronger 
points come from devia-
tions in the pace; "Father 
and Son" tells enough of a 
story to rise above the 
record's masculine Avril 
Lavigne sound that's most-
ly made-for-radio. Wtl/-
made-for-radio. 

Sure, the songs might 
begin to blend early on, 
but the production is 
sharp, the hooks are huge 
and hummable, and it 
becomes apparent that this 
music doesn't need a 
charismatic frontma n or 
unique sryle when it so 
nicely fills the airspace 
between commercials. 

Sevtnum Days is either 
rock music for folks (yes, 
folks) who don't like rock 
or pop music for folks 
who think they might. It's 
finely crafted enough that 
you can expect to hear it 
filling car dealership air-
waves all year long. Just 
don't expect the DJ to 
remember the lead 
singer's name.

MFDoom 
Mm ... Food? 
Rhymesayers 

**, 

M F Doom must have been a busy man in 2004, releasing four 
albums, including the 
unbelievably successful 
Madvillainy. Mm " . Food.' 
is his final offering from 
last year, and probably his 
most involved project; he 
racks up most of the pro-
duction credits, although 
some beats were recycled 
from his previous Special 
Herbs records. 

Fans of Metal Fingers 
Doom will be pleased that 
he has stayed true to his 
roots, continuing to take 
bizarre samples scratched 
together with audio clips 
of the F antastic Four and 
laced with some of the wit-
tiest lyrics you'll ever hear, 
delivered in his signature 

monotone flow. 
Songs such as "Deep 

Fried Frenz," "Hoe 
Cakes" and "Kookies" 
illustrate why Doom tops 
many rap elitist's wish-
lists, tightly weaving 
clever metaphors and 
word play around a strong 
conceptual foundation. 

Doom's lyrical talent 
has never been called into 
question, but for those who 
dare, "Potholderz" and 
"Rap Snitch Knishes· show 
what might be in store for 
anyone brave enough to 
test the masked villain. 

Mm .. . Food? is a 
respectable album that 
starts and finishes strong. 
Unfortunately, what's in 
between the beginning 
and the end of the album is 
an absolute barren waste-
land of instrumentals, 
audio clips and skits 
(w.hich Doom refers to 
affectionately as "special 
recipes"). 

This album has several 
stand-out tracks, but 
Doom's eccentrics break 
up any sense of cohesion, 
and the record simply 
does not meet the stan-
dard set by previous 
albums Operation: 
DoomsdllY, Vaudeville 
Villain and Madvillainy.

Purple Haze 
Roc-A-Fella 

*** 

On the modesry spec-trum, most rappers tend to fall on the 
cocky side of humble. 

• However, out of all the 
conceited rappers in the 
world, Cam'ron, the man 
who si ngle-handedly 
brought pink back to the 
streets, may very well be 
the most arrogant. 

On his fourth offici al 
solo release, Purple Haze, 
Cam'ron teams his best 
production yet with some 
of his worst lyricism to 
produce a CD more hip-
pop than hip-hop . • 

Cam'ron's lyrics are 
undeniably weak, but his 
impeccably smooth flow 
compensates more often 
than not, creating songs 
that aren't intellectually 

stimulating but will have 
you nodding your head 
and laughing at the same 
time. 

The production sryle is 
rypical of any Diplomat 
album, relying heavily on 
sped-up soul samples a la 
Kanye West, who is fea-
tured on "Down and Out." 

This album attempts to 
please a variery of fans, 
with "Leave Me Alone PI. 
II" and "Dope Man" 
intended for those craving 
some harder East Coast 
rap, while "Harlem 
Streets," "Soap Opera" 
and "More Reasons" tar-
get the MTV audience. 

Some songs, however, 
aren't going to please any-
body, and "Girls," featllr-
ing an unforgivably inept 
Cyndi Lauper sample, is 
the most glaring example. 

The self-proclaimed 
}(jng of Harlem has 
released his best solo effort 
since 1998's Confmions of 
Fire, and with its poppy 
production coupled with 
Cam'ron's slick flavor, 
Purple Haze seems des-
tined for success. Lyric 
lovers need not apply, bu t 
if Killa Cam's contagious 
confidence is enough, 
you'll be blazin' Purple 
Hau for a while.

serious ass. No, it 's not the fourth 
installment of the "Matrix" series 
(thank god), it's "Constallline," a 
film adaptation of cu lt comic book 
"HelIbbzer." Reeves plays John 
Constantine, a r<lther Neo-esque 
hero with a penchant for strong 
drinks, thi ck smoke and wry 
humor. 

Reeve's character has the abiliry 
to see half-demons and half-a ngels 
disguised as humans in the mod-
ern gateway between heaven and 
hell (where else but Los Angeles). 
He is, in a sense, a border patrol 
agent, maintaining the balance 
between good and evil on earth. 

But Constantine is a flawed 
hero and not just because of his 
nasry smoking ha bi t. His powers 
traumatized him during his child-
hood and led him to attempt sui -
cide. H e survived, but was doomed 
to hell as punishment, a likely 
explanation for hi s cynical atti-
tude . Constantine's work leads 
him to a detective, played by 
Rachel Weisz, who is investigating 

lem with "Constantine": it's a film 
with a lot of sryle and not enough 
substance. Certainly comic book 
adaptations are not films you go to 
expecting stimulating dialogue, 
but it seems the filmmakers spent 
so much time generating fancy 
images that they forgot to develop 
the story past its (acrually interest-
ing) premise. Plot action unfolds 
in a convoluted way, and the last 
third of the film consists of one 
action scene aFter another -
which is not surprising, consider-
ing Lawrence comes from the 
world of music videos. 

@ Film ~ REVIEW 
formulai c comi c book side kick. 
Probably the biggest dis apoint-
ment is Peter Stormal'e's portrayal 
of Satan. It's not that SWl'mare 
can't do evil (he did a pi ctry con-
vincing job of it in "Fargo"). I h· 
just channels a Prince of Darkness 
that 's a bit too much like \"'oody 
Allen. . 

Hellrazer: John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) takes on the arduous task of 
playing detective and picking out the demons that roam Los Angeles. 

In his most notable role since 
"The Matrix" trilogy, Reeves 
shows that once again, he is com-
fortable carrying an action film. 
His dry wit is a nice additive to 
many scenes, but he walks a fine 
line between comedy and corni-
ness. Though Weisz is impressive 
as the female lead, it might be 
because she spends a good portion 
of the film in a pool wearing a 
white shirt. 

Warner Bros . is hoping to 
make a franchi se ou t the 
Constantine character, and sequels 
to worse films ha ve been made. If 
they do drag this one Ollt. let's 
hope they avoid the failures of 
"The Matrix" by paying a bit more 
attention to plot. Constanti ne 's 
first iteration offers ome great 
visuals, but not much else. 

the death of her sister. 
Visually, the film works on 

many levels. First-time director 
Francis Lawrence's action 
sequences are srunning, depicting 
the supernatural with a comic 
book's sense of imagination and 
sryle. 

However, comparisons to 
another futuristic sci-fi action 
story are inevitable and not just 

because of Reeves. The aesthetics 
of "Constantine" are obviously 
influenced by "The Matrix": 
seemingly dull settings, such as 
indoor pools and bowling alleys, 
are slightly twisted, and 
Lawrence's special effects use slow 
motion and water to make for a 
few breathtaking visuals. 

But their frequent use does a 
poor job of hiding the main prob-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 17 . 200S 

French play revived after single 
performance 200 years ago 

One-act 'La Dispute' explores notions of love, 
eroticism, biological. determinism and cruelty 
8, OAKLEY ANDERSON· 

MOORE 
Staff Writer 

In 1744, Pierre Marivaux wrote a play by the name of "La Dispute ." It showed for one 
night, received lukewarm reviews, 
and closed, not to be seen again 
for some 200 years. 

Now, in the 21st century, in the 
wake of world wars and the advent 
of reality television, "La Dispute" 
has been reborn, not as a love 
comedy but as a more twisted play 
about monitored human experi -
ments with sinister social unde r-
pinnings. 

"It is. a rare opportunity to see 
this play because we see some-
thing unsettling and resonant," 
said visiting director Darko 
Tresnjak, who brings Marivaux's 
work to the UCSD stage for a 
graduate theater production. 
"Time has made [the play) more 
powerful, which is unfortunate for 
what it says about the world ." 

The extended one-act play is 
about the experiments of a prince 
(Scot t Drummond) who orders 
four babies, two girls and two 
boys, to be raised in solitude by 
two aged caretakers (Jennifer 
Chang and Mark Smith). 
Eventually, they will be shown to 
each other to prove which ge nder 
is the first to be unfaithful - male 
or female . 

While exploring ideas of love, 
biologital determinism, eroticism 
and cruelty, the four youths grow 
aware of their own selves, experi-
ence their first loves and know 
their first betrayals. 

Tresnjalc: says that working on 
the play has been a great exercise 
in not talc:ing the worle too literal -
ly. 

"Everything turns to violence, 
not because of human nature, but 
because [the characters] are 
caught in an experiment th at 
shows a damaging social system," 
he said. "It is a rigged experi -
ment ." 

Marivaux finds a niche in 
today's growing social conscious-
ness that explores the perm uta-
tions of the human heart. 

The play is set in a world 
devoid of color - white ground, 
white sky and white trees . The set 
also incl udes a flowing river where 
the youths first come to see their 
reflections. (Tresnjak would have 
flooded the pit for this if it were 
not so expensive.) 

To achieve the effect of inno-
cent youth, A.K. Murtadha, who 
plays the boy Azor, said he talked a 
lot with Tresnjak about discovery 
and wonder. 

"You need to make it feel rca I 
fo r the audience . Things in acti ng 
are often about discoveries," said 
Carmen Gill, who plays the girl , 
Egle . • 

Theater 
REVIEW 

In this case, Murtadha and Gill, 
along with Keiana Richard and 
Samuel Stricklen, had to imagine 
bacle to the first moment they di s-
covered themse lves and others. 
Their work is evident in the per-
formances: Something resembling 
true delight trickles across their 
faces as they see their own pictures 
or find another being their age in 
the white forest. 

There is something quite gen-
uine and touching tha t breaks the 
audience's hearts as we see the 
characters grow more awa re 0 
their urroundings and experience 
hate, betrayal and violence under 
the oppressive ye t charming gaze 
of the prince and his lover 
Hermaine (leri Kretz). 

If you are looking for medita -
tions on love and the human COI1 -
dition on the coa ttails of 
Valentine's Day- something with 
a bit more edge than chocolate-
covered strawberries and stllffed 
teddy bears - or if YOlllllst want a 
cha nce to see the coveted Tresnjak 
work with U SD Nbster of Fine 
Arts candidates , be sure to see" La 
Dispme" sometime dUClng its Feb. 
20 to Feb. 26 rlln in the Mandell 
Weiss Theatre.

saddled us with an enormous national debt, made it harder to attend 

college without crushing loans , harder to get a decent job and health care

Baseball: Boutilier pitches big game 
continued {rom page 16 

worst game we have pla),ed 
so far this year, the positive 
thing is that we had the 
opporrunity to win, " UCSD 
head coach Dan O'Brien 
said. "We just couldn't close 
this one out." 

The seven-inning night-
cap game told a different 
story for UCSD. Behind the 
stellar pitching of senior 
hurler Logan Boutilier (2-
0), the Tritons were able to 
srunt the Rangers and pull 
through with the victory, 6-
2. 

Boutilier went the dis-
tance in the game, striking 
out eight and allowing only 
two earned runs . For his 
efforts, UCSD Athletics 
named Boutilier the Athlete 
of the Week. 

"Logan pitched a solid 
game for \1S," O'Brien said . 
"That's what you wanr and 
look for out of your veter-
ans . He stepped up and gave 
us a great, complete game 
afte r a tough loss." 

The winning continued 
on Feb. 15 as UCSD hand-
ed Poinr Lorna its first loss 
of the year. While down 7-S 
in the top of the ninth 
inning, the Tritons posted 
three runs, capped by a 
two-run home run by 
sophomore catcher David 
Morehead, to earn the vic-
tory, 8-7 . 

UCSD played solid base-
ball in the field and on the 
base paths. The team regis-
tered 13 hits. Hernandez 
went 4-for-5 with three sin-
gles and a clutch double. 
Morehead went 2-for-4 
with three RBLs and a run 
scored. 

D efensively, the Tritons 
were errorless. Juni or hurler 
Byron Grubman started and 
threw just over three 
innings, before seven other 
UCSD pitchers camc in on

with Lipetz ultimately 
notchi ng the win after retir-
ing three Sea Lions batters 
in a row. 

The Sea Lions seemed to 
be on track for the victory in 
the bottom of the fourth 
when first baseman Kevin 
Campbell and ca tcher Will 
Craig smacked back-to-back 
home run s. The homers 
accounted for Point Lama's 
four-run inning and put the 
Sea Lions up 7-3 . 

Bm the Tritons' tenacity 
never wavered as they rallied 
for the victory. 

"This was a great win for 
the team," O'Brien said. 
"The best thi ng is that we 
pl ayed good baseball. Whi le

my focus and JUSt played, trying not 
to think too much. I didn't worry 
about winning or losing, just on 
playing. I hope that we as a team 
can learn to not put too much pres-
sure on ourselves, take things point 
by poi nt and ju t have fun. " 

Head coach Liz LaPlante is very 
encouraged by the team's perfor-
mance. 

"Since we have pretty much the 
same group back, we have a lot of 
experience," she said. "Players that 
were new last year are a lot more 
confident this year. Even one year's 
experience makes a big difference." 

The team's overall record is

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

After inclement weather can-
celed the first twO games of the 
series between UCSD and Regis 
University, the Tritons (4-1) and 
the Rangers (5- 1) finally squared 
off in doubleheader action on Feb. 
13 at Triton Baseball Stadium. 
Regis inched out the first game, 5-
4, while UCSD came back in the 
second game to post a 6-2 win. On 
Feb. 15, the Tritons took on cross-
town rival Point Lorna (6-1) and 
rallied late in the game for the vic-
tory, 8-7. 

Up 4-2 in the opener against 
Regis, the Tritons saw victory 
ripped from their grasp, as the 
Ranger rallied in the eighth and 
put up three runs on three hits and 
a UCSD error to take the lead and 
the win , 5-4. 

Triton junior starter Jose 
Navarro pitched seven solid 
innings, striking out five and 
allowing only two earned runs. 
The Regis rally mounted in the 
eighth after senior closer Shlomo 
Lipetz (I - I) came on in relief. 

Offensively, UCSD junior cen-
terfielder Matt Lawson, senior 
leftfielder Joel Clark, junior right-
fi elder Damian Fante, senior 
shortstop Keith Hernandez, 
senior second baseman Ricky

man Alex Gascon each had a hit in

sweeps weekend series

and Cal State Stanislaus 
By KELU PlAKASH 

Staff Writer 

The Tritons women's basketball 
team had a great weekend against 
its Northern California rivals, 
comin'g off with two wins at 
RIMAC Arena against Chico State 
on Feb. II and Cal State Stanislaus 
Feb. 12. 

The Tritons defeated the No. 
15 Chico State, 80-77, before a 
home audience of 319 fans in a 
game that saw excellent defense 
from both teams.At halftime, the 
Tritons (13-8 overall, 9-5 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) led the Wildcats 51-

. 45, though the teams were relative-
ly well-matched. The difference 
for the Tritons was in their team's 
defensive play. The Wildcats (16-4 
overall, 10-3 CCAA) had 27 
turnovers compared to the Tritons' 
14. Chico State managed only five 
steals while UCSD had 15. 

A leading Triton player in the 
match was senior center Margaret 
Johnson, who posted 19 points, 
nine .rebounds and three assists. 
Right behind her was sophomore 
forward Hillary Hansen, who 
recorded a double-double with 18 
points, a game-high 10 rebounds 
and three assists. Junior forward 
Karina Siam posted 14 points, and 
junior guard Andrea Herold 
earned eight. Sophomore guard 
Leora Juster was on fire with 10 

points, nine rebounds, six assists 
and five steals. 

Key players for the Wildcats 
included Kim Abts, with 21 points, 
six rebounds and nine assists. 
Lauren Himmelspach followed 
with 15 points, and Amber 
Simmons added 12 points and 12 
rebounds in the loss. 

The Tritons continued their 
winning weekend against oppo-
nent CSU Stanislaus (4-17 overall, 
3 -11 CCAA) on Feb. 12 when they 
defeated the Warriors, 83-80, in 
one of the closest games of the sea-
son. 

UCSD remained flat through-
out most of the third quarter, trail-
ing by 13 poiJ1ts in a 67-54 
Warriors game. By the end of the 
third quarter, the Tritons began to 
come back. managing a 19-6 run 
over the next six minutes. 

With two minutes left on the 
clock, the Warriors and Tritons 
were tied at 80. Johnson completed 
the second of her two free throws, 
adding a point to the Tritons' 
score. 

Latricia Nickelberry of the 
Warriors missed a lay-up in the last 
16 seconds that would have tied 
the game. Juster was fouled and 
converted her free throws for the 
Tritons to take the lead and the win 
at 83-80.

UCSD starts off regular 
season with a 2-2 record 

Siddiqui clinches match win 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

U tilizing the prodigious talents 
o f its rookies, the UCSD softball 
team played four games in its open-
ing week of the 2005 season, split-
ting both doubleheaders. A number 
of freshmen stood out despite the 
team's early-season .500 record. 

"The games have been reaJly 
good team efforts, especially by the 
freshmen," Triton head coach 
Patricia Gerckens said.

Game one on Feb. 5 against 
University of San Diego (1 -2) was 
scoreless until the top of the fiftb 
inning, when the Tritons (2-2) put 
together four singles and took a 2-0 
lead. UCSD added two more runs 
in the seventh to finish the scoring 
at 4-0. 

"Though the team played well, 
the bits didn't come together," 
Gerckens said. 

The first round of the double-
header also marked the second 
complete-game victory of the sea-
son for sophomore pitcher Tma 
Rowe, who allowed only four hits 
and struck out five in her seven 
innings of work. 

"Rowe pitched a really good 
game," Gerckens said. 

With one run scored and three 
RBIs at the top of the lineup, junior 
Jenny Spencer, freshman Danielle 
Lull and senior team captain Jamie 
Hurst went a combined 6-for- ll. 

The Torreros won the second 
game, 5-2. Senior hurler Kelley 
Bryant allowed three runs on six

of work- Freshman Nicole

runs on four hits in her two and

Women's tennis beats Division I Davis 
By EVAN WANG 

Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team spent the weekend ofFeh. 12 
and Feb. 13 waiting out uncooper-
ative weather and coun conditions 
in anticipation for home matches 
against Cal Poly Pomona and UC 
Davis. While the Tritons were 
never able to take the court 
against their California Collegiate 
Athletic Association rival r the 
Broncos, the match between the 
Tritons and Aggies on Feb. 13 
turned into an exciting one, and 
when ::11 was said and done, the 
Tritons emerged victorious. 

The match, originally slated to 
begin at 10:30 a.m. at the 
Northview Tennis Courts, was 
delayed due to numerous pools of 
water that had coHected on the 
court from rainstorms. When the 
rain stopped and the sun peeked 
out through the clouds, the courts 
were still not in playing condition, 
and competition had to be post-
poned for over an hour and a half 
while the court was dried. 

At 12:15 p.m., the players 
finaHy hit the court. The Tritons 
took an early lead in doubles play, 
with the tandems of sophomores 
Kristin Bronowicki and Katie 
McKee picking up an 8-5 win at 
the No.2 spot, and senior Jasmin 
Dao and junior Marissa Hilker 
winning at the No. 3 spot, 8-3. 
The Tritons' No.1 doubles team" 
junior Tara Siddiqui and sopbo-
mOi e Marsha Malinow, dropped 
an 8-4 decision. 

UCSD took a 2-1 lead enter-
ing singles play, but the Aggies

Outch: Junior Tara Siddiqui, down 0-2 in a third set super tiebreaker, scored 
10 straight points to give UCSD the win against UC Davis on Feb. 13. 
stormed back and won the top 
three spots. Dao, MaJinow and 
Hilker fought hard, but all went 
down in straight sets. 

At the bottom of the ladder, at 
the No. 5 and No. 6 spots, the 
Tritons' Bronowicki and junior 
Leigh Roberts came through for 
UCSD, picking up straight-set 
wins of their own, 6-1, 6-2 and 7-5, 
6-2, respectively. This deadlocked 
the match score between the two 
teams at 4-4, with one left to play. 

This set the stage for a dramat-
ic and decisive finish between 
Siddiqui, in her first singles match 
of the season, and the Aggies' 
freshman Kaidin Callan at the 
No.4 singles spot. The two com-
petitors played in the only three-
set match of the day, with Callan 
talring the tint set, 6-3, and 
Siddiqui taking the second by the 

same score. This set up a third set 
that - unbeknownst to the play-
ers at the time- would decide the 
victor of the match. 

Due to the travel plans of the 
UC Davis team, it was decided 
before the players went on to play 
the third set that it would be an 
abbreviated, super tie-breaker that 
would be won by the first to 10 
points, winning by two. The tie-
breaker started off a little shaky 
for Siddiqui, she fell into an early 
0-2 hole before rightin~ the ship 
and reeling off 10 straight points. 

"Not Jmowing that • was play-
ing for the whole match in that 
tie-break really helped," Siddiqui 
said. ". started off the match real-
ly tense, and got frustrated. But 
early in the second set, • regained
