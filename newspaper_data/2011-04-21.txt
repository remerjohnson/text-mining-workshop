UCSD ADmitS ReCoRD 
oUt-of-StAte StUDentS

A student forum on the future of campus li-braries took place on April 19 in Price Center Theater, during which a panel of 
university librarians and student leaders  dis-
cussed  the  budget  issues affecting these resources.  
      With a current budget of $25.2 million, campus librar-
ies currently receive revenue from state funds, indirect 
cost recovery funds (money the university receives for 
services that use grants) and endowments.

The budget is spent in three ways. According to Uni-
versity Librarian Brian Schottlaender, 62 percent is set 
aside for services and operations, while collections make 
up 28 percent and  miscellaneous expenses, such as tech-
nology and administrative costs, account for 10 percent 
of the budget.

Schottlaender presented the libraries’ proposed bud-
get. According to Schottlaender, the budget has been re-
duced by almost $5 million since 2008, and there has been 
an increased use of library services despite having no new 
additions to the budget.

This year, the libraries cut costs by eliminating 38 posi-
tions that specialized in user services, administrative and 
technical support. Schottlaender said the bulk of the ser-
vices budget is in salaries, but libraries have already cut 
$2.4 million in staff salaries.

The libraries department closed the Medical Center Li-
brary in Hillcrest on April 1, cut the hours of Geisel and 
Biomedical Libraries by 12 percent in September 2010 and 
reduced the Geisel Library service points — the reference, 
reserve and circulation desks throughout the library.

In addition, the library system has extended public

Admission data released April 
18 shows a lower UCSD admit 
rate for the class entering Fall 
2011, as well as more offers for 
out-of-state students. 

The data showed a 0.5 percent 
overall drop in admission from 
38.1 percent to 34.1 percent. 
California residents made up 76.7 
percent of freshman admits, fewer 
than the 84.3 percent admitted in 
2010. Out-of-state student admits 
rose 36 percent and international 
students jumped 47.7 percent 
from 8.4 percent to 12.2 percent. 

UCSD spokesperson Christine 
Clark said the rising numbers 
may be attributed to insufficient 
funding, since international and 
out-of-state students pay higher 
tuition than California residents.

As of 2011, the total amount 
of tuition paid by students will be 
greater than what the state funds 
the system. 

Across all UC campuses, over 
41 percent of admitted freshmen 
will be the first in their families to 
earn a college degree. 

The proportion of those 
graduating from high schools 
with low Academic Performance 
Index scores — a measure of 
the academic performance and 
progress of individual schools — 
also increased from 17.6 percent 
to 22.8 percent. Nearly 37 percent 
of freshman admitted for 2011 are 
from low-income families.

The number  of 
underrepresented minority 
students admitted to UCSD 
for Fall 2011 increased by 15.4 
percent over last year, from 3,041 

students to 3,512.
“Despite the highly competitive 

nature of this year’s admission 
process, we have expanded 
access to many students who 
are traditionally underserved in 
higher education,” UC interim 
undergraduate admissions 
director Pamela Burnett said. “The 
proportion of our new California 
residents from underrepresented 
racial and ethnic groups grew 
from about 28 percent in 2010 to 
nearly 31 percent in 2011.”

Based on self-reported 
admissions data, African-
American make up 2.4 percent of 
the total admits, while Mexican-
Americans compose 19.6 percent 
of the total. Just over 25 percent 
of admits — or 4,568 — are first-
generation college students.

“We are also pleased that the 
number of underrepresented 
students admitted to the university 
went up 15 percent this year and 
we remain committed to ensuring 
accessibility and affordability for 
all students who want to attend 
UC San Diego,” Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox said in a statement.

Overall, the number of 
students who were admitted to the 
UC system increased by 6 percent 
— from 68,329 admits in 2010 to 
72,432 admits this year — though 
UCSD accepted around 100 fewer 
students than last year. 

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Admissions Mae 
Brown, the decrease in student 
admissions is to compensate for 
this year’s slight over-enrollment 
in 2010.

The University of California is using a $780,000 grant 
and a $6.9 million loan to fund the UC Online Instruction 
Pilot Project, an initiative where online UC courses will 
be offered to take the place of some large, lower-division 
lectures. 

The research project will rely on UC education experts’ 
interpretation of test scores, professor input and student 
interviews to determine whether the classes are comparable 
to more traditional, classroom-based courses.

“It’s mostly higher-enrollment courses, like Chem 
1A, lower-division calculus, and Psych 1A,” UC Online 
Instruction Pilot Project project manager DoQuyen Tran-
Taylor said. “We’ve heard some students are having trouble 
getting into these courses, and not getting these courses 
can put students behind a quarter or more. We’re trying to 
address a bottleneck.”

Twenty-nine online course proposals will progress to 
the planning stages out of roughly 70 letters  A 10-member 
committee — comprised of administration and academic 
senate members —selected 29 course proposals to advance 
to the planning stages out of the roughly 70 received. The 
only letter of intent selected from UCSD was written by 
Associate Professor of Music Shlomo Dubnov for a class 
called Acoustics and Digital Music Creation and Production. 

The program will be funded in part by the grant from 
the Next Generation Learning Challenges program, which 
received funding from both the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation and the William Flora Hewlett Foundation.

“We’ve been looking for foundation and external 
funding,” Tran-Taylor said. “[The grant should fund 10 of 
our courses, but not quite enough to really fund everything 
we have.”

The 10 funded courses have not been selected, but

teenage Use of  Hookah on the Rise, Cigarette Use Declines
sciEncE and tEcHnoLoGY

By Nicole Chan
Staff Writer

High school students are trading 
cigarettes for hookah — an alternative 
form of tobacco — according to 
a 2010 study led by epidemiology 
associate professor Wael Al-Delaimy 
and postdoctoral student Joshua 
Smith.

According to a 2009 national Youth 
Risk Behavior Survey administered to 
high school students by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, the 
number of students who have smoked 
a cigarette dropped from 70.4 percent 
to 46.3 percent over 10 years. 

Al-Delaimy said the decline may 
be a result of effective educational 
campaigns. But while it suggests that 
overall nicotine intake levels have 
decreased among teens, researchers 
believe that people are smoking tobacco 
in other forms, Smith explained. 

Researchers surveyed 689 students 
from three San Diego county high 
schools to compare demographics with 
patterns of use. Students were given a 

44-question survey on use of cigarettes, 
chewing tobacco and hookah. Students 
were also asked about the proximity of 
hookah lounges to their communities. 

“This is the first study to document 
hookah use of teens in such detail,” 
Al-Delaimy said.

Smith said lifelong tobacco use 
usually begins in adolescence and is 
established by the age of 18, making 
high school students optimal subjects.

Researchers found that 26.1 percent 
of students have tried hookah and 
that most students — 50.3 percent of 
those surveyed — know about hookah 
from their friends. About 30 percent of 
those surveyed who have tried hookah 
intend to use it again in the future, and 
a majority of students know of hookah 
lounges in their communities. 

Smith said the rise of hookah in 
the county can be attributed to word of 
mouth and an increasing presence of 
hookah lounges within the last decade. 

“One out of 10  students interviewed 
have smoked hookah in the last 30 
days,” Smith said. “This is equal to 
current cigarette smoking.”

Al-Delaimy said hookah use is a 
social practice that gained popularity 
within the past five years. Hookah use 
is potentially more dangerous than 
cigarette smoking, Al-Delaimy said, 
because of the social nature of the 
practice: Each session lasts about 45  to 
60 minute, enabling the user to intake 
high amounts of tobacco.

“The important message to take 
away is that people who have tried 
hookah are similar to those who have 
tried cigarettes,” Al-Delaimy said. 

The researchers argue that hookah 
has many of the same risks and 
nicotine levels as cigarette smoking. 
They said hookah users were more 
likely than nonusers to have smoked 
a cigarette. 

 Of the students who had heard of 
hookah, 59.5 percent believed it to be 
more socially acceptable than cigarettes 
and 46.3 percent believed it to be safer 
than cigarettes. Most users are unaware 
of the risks and diseases associated 
with hookah smoking. Al-Delaimy 
said it is related to several preventable 
diseases, including coronary heart 

disease and cancers of the lung, mouth 
and bladder. 

The researchers recommend 
that hookah lounges have the same 
regulations as cigarettes. Although 
the legal age to enter a lounge is 18, 
13.5 percent of those that claimed 
they visited lounges while underage, 
suggesting some establishments are lax 
in enforcing the age restriction.

Fee Referendum Possible to Maintain Library Services
computer replacements from four 
to five years, discontinued the main 
campus intra-library book delivery 
service and has started to phase out 
mediated circulation in the Geisel 
and Biomedical libraries.

Schottlaender said the libraries 
were told to prepare for a $3 million 
cut. In response, they are proposing 
to close four more campus libraries: 
Science and Engineering, Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography, CLICS 
and IR/PS, as well as consolidating 
these collections into the Biomedi-
cal Library. These libraries could 
close as early as this summer.

Closing the Medical Center. 
SIO and S&E Libraries would cut 
$645,000 from the budget, while 
closing CLICS cuts $450,000 and 
closing IR/PS cuts $345,000.

The floor was then opened up for 

student input.
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 

Olushade Unger asked if the closure 
of the Medical Center Library was 
permanent and if a student fee ref-
erendum was necessary to prevent 
this. Associate University Librarian 
Catherine Friedman said they will 
finish clearing out the library within 
the next few weeks.

A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
said a fee proposal would have to 
come through A.S. Council and the 
Graduate Student Association. GSA 
president John Alaniz added that if 
a student fee were proposed, stu-
dents should have oversight to make 
sure the university does not misuse 
funds.

Marshall College junior Jordan 
Liss asked if this student referendum 
trend could benefit the library situ-
ation. 

Alaniz, Schottlaeder and GSA 
Legislative Liaison Kristopher 
Nelson responded by saying that 
spreading the message of the budget 
crisis is important.

Schottlaeder said he’s in regular 
contact with the administration in 
regard to the budget cuts.

“There isn’t a day that goes by 
where I’m not talking to administra-
tion,” Schottlaeder said. “That’s what 
I get paid to do. Having said that, 
there are so many competing de-
mands for what is a relatively small 
pool of donors in San Diego. There’s 
a saying in library development that 
the library is everybody’s second fa-
vorite thing. If there’s a cancer cen-
ter, then that will be chosen over the 
library.”

Last night’s 40-minute meeting may have broken a record for the shortest meeting of 
the year, as special presentations 
and resolutions were postponed to 
next week’s meeting and prompted 
councilmembers to shoot the breeze.

Tritons For Israel President Lior 
Abramson and 
Social Relations 
Chair Jessica 
Baltmanas invited 
councilmembers 
to a banquet 
called “Rethinking 
Israel/Palestine: 
Building Bridges 
at Home and Abroad” on April 28 at 
7 p.m. in Great Hall. There will be a 
campus dialogue as well as speakers 
and a conference call with youth 
leaders from Israel and Palestine.

Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Arohi Sharma 
announced that the product for 
the Sun God “Know Your Rights” 
campaign was ordered. It was an 
orange cup that changes colors to 
red. It should be a more effective 
marketing tool than the “If it burns 
when you pee, it’s probably an STD” 
shirt from last year’s campaign.

Campuswide Senator Elizabeth 
Elman encouraged councilmembers 
to stop using Styrofoam on campus.

President Wafa Ben Hassine said 
the Library Forum went well, noting 
that 50 to 60 students showed up. 
(As an attendee, I beg to differ. It was 
more like 30 attendees — maybe 40 
at most.)

Associate Vice President of 
Student Organizations Carli Thomas 
requested that Sharma rap. Sharma 
then hesitantly proceeded to perform 
a one-minute rap song full of 
vulgarities. 

Arts and Humanities Senator 
Shunya Wade brought a big red 

bouncy ball to council and asked 
people to play with it. “Bounce it 
around and be friends,” she said.

Sixth College Senator Parminder 
Sandhu announced that the Relay 
for Life event on April 16 raised over 
$53,000 for the American Cancer 
Society.

One of the 
most exciting 
events of the 
evening was a 
vote on what color 
Associate Vice 
President of Local 
Affairs Matthew 
Vu’s new hairstyle 

will be. The options were rainbow 
sherbet, dead flamingo, Lady Gaga 
or Rufio — votes were evenly split, 
so Vu did not finalize his choice. Vu 
said his current hairstyle is a mistake 
because he accidentally bleached part 
of his hair pink.

Warren College President and A.S. 
President-elect Alyssa Wing said the 
Divestment Community Dialogue 
event on April 18 went well. The event 
was meant to facilitate discussion over 
the proposed resolution suggesting 
the UC system no longer support 
companies invested in Israel.

All seats were filled, even though 
the event was organized at the 
last minute and took place on the 
first night of the Jewish holiday of 
Passover.

Social Sciences Senator Rena 
Zuabi urged councilmembers to talk 
to her about any issues they have with 
the divestment resolution ahead of 
next week’s meeting, in the interest of 
saving time. 

The meeting ended after Associate 
Vice President of Concerts and 
Events Brian Wong dropped a hint 
that there may be a laser field at the 
Sun God Festival. Still no word on the 
last of the main stage acts, though.

First Online UC Classes Will be Offerred This Fall
will be determined by course design 
and faculty availability.   All  course 
materials will be available to the public, 
although only UC students will be 
allowed to take the courses for UC 
credit.

The project will also benefit from a 
$6.9-million internal UC loan funded 
through the Strategic Investment 
Program, which draws from the budget 
of the UC Chief Financial Officer.

The Chief Financial Officer pays 
the interest with its budget, so the 
program does not need to pay interest. 

UCOP spokesperson Steve Montiel 
said the loan will give the project’s 
coordinators time to seek additional 
grants. The loan is a seven-year, zero 
interest loan. Each course is estimated 
to cost roughly $75,000 due to 
equipment, programming, faculty and 
staff costs. Enrolled UC students will 

not have to pay for the classes outside 
of their standard tuition. The loan will 
fund the difference between the cost of 
the project and the amount of funding 
the program receives from grants. 

“We can draw $6.9 million,” Tran-
Taylor said. “It doesn’t mean we’re 
using all of it, and it certainly doesn’t 
mean that we’re using it all this year.”

Montiel  said the loan was acquired 
within the last three weeks but is more 
similar to a line of   credit that can 
be drawn on over a period of time 
as needed. The project managers are 
unsure of when they will pay back the 
loan, according to Tran-Taylor.

“When we pay the loan back 
depends on how much we borrow,” 
Tran-Taylor said.  “We expect to pay 
back the loan well before the [seven-
year] deadline.”

After the loans are paid back, the 
revenue from online courses will fund 

individual departments across all UC 
campuses. 

“The purpose of this project isn’t 
designed to maximize revenues and 
bring in a large cash flow,” Tran-
Taylor said. “It is about whether or 
not it makes sense to move into online 
education.”

The team is still working to reduce 
the project’s dependence on loans.

“We’re still continuing to look for 
other grant opportunities,” said Tran-
Taylor.   “We are very determined to 
look for more external funds.”

The first classes, which are still 
being reviewed and largely based on 
input from professors will be open 
to enrolled all currently enrolled UC 
students for the 2011-12 academic 
year.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN www.UCSDGUARDIAN.oRG/oPINIoNTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2011

L ess than three months after announcing his candidacy,  Donald Trump has risen to the 
top of the 2012 Republican primary 
horserace, tying with former Arkansas 
governor Mike Huckabee for top 
honors, according to a recent CNN 
poll. Trump, who has zero political 
experience, appears to have followed 
the proven Palin method of domina-
tion: saying stupid shit to grab head-
lines, and instead of concrete goals for 
reform, his platform seems to consist 
of taking the oil from Libya and 
repeating that President Obama wasn’t 

born in the U.S.
That tired conspiracy theory has 

somehow still not been put to rest, 
despite conclusive evidence to the 
contrary from Hawaii, Obama’s birth-
place. According to a February Public 
Policy poll, a staggering 51 percent 
of GOP primary voters believe the 
President wasn’t born in the U.S, and 
it seems the surest road to the GOP 
nomination is just to perpetuate those 
claims.

Even if Trump doesn’t win the 
nomination, he will have successfully 
convinced some Americans that a 
vote for Obama is essentially a vote for 
a Kenyan-born secret Muslim. (He’ll 
also have done something that many 
consider impossible: Make Newt 
Gingrich look sane.)

Trump’s success isn’t all due to 
his outrageous claims. Maybe part of 
the reason Trump is doing so well in 
the polls is because of his perceived 
success in business, can be seen as 
an asset in ensuring the economy 
rebounds. But while Trump has made 
millions he’s also filed bankruptcy 
through Trump Enterprises three 
times. Most recently, in 2009, Trump 
filed for Chapter 11 with $50 million 
in assets to his $500 million in debt. 

And have I mentioned that his 
resort and casino business — you 
know, a place where visitors regularly 
pay to lose money — also went bank-
rupt? How’s that for business savvy?

Despite all of this, some are still 
delusional enough to believe that 
Trump could steer the economy in the 
right direction.

 Just three years after Republicans 
stressed Obama’s lack of experience 
in the 2008 election, many are back-
ing Trump, today best-known for his 
NBC reality TV show. This is a man 
with no history of political experi-
ence, save lobbying, and who last year 
suggested Al Gore be stripped of his 
Nobel Peace Prize for his work on cli-
mate change, considering that a snow-
storm had recently hit New York City. 

Admittedly, the only reasons 
Huckabee and Trump are at the top 
could be that they both have their 
own bully pulpits. Palin and Gingrich, 
also close in the polls, are regular 
commentators on Fox News. Without 
airing any commercial, these politi-
cians have soared to fame. 

It is uncertain whether Trump’s 
outlandish claims about Obama’s birth 
by Trump will not hold any sway in 
the general election. The president is a 
man with a silver tongue and can best 
the boorish Trump in any debate. Lies 
can generate some initial popularity, 
but the issues are the tried-and-true 
method of affecting American voters.

Trumped-
Up Primary 
Isn’t Worth 
the Hype Admitting more out-of-state students may nudge UCSD closer to 

being in the black, but at a steep cost. 

This week, the UC Office of the President released admissions data for this 
fall’s entering class. While accep-
tance rates are up systemwide, 
the results are a mixed bag for 
the future of our institution. 

Compared to last year, the 
rate of out-of state students and 
international students rose by a 
staggering 4 percent. And while 
it’s great that these students are 
bringing in much-needed funds, 
these admission rates are gradu-
ally privatizing the UC system, a 
change that will ultimately hurt 
the institution’s goals. 

Ultimately, admitting more 
out-of-state and international 
students goes against the mis-
sion of the UC system, which is 

to serve the in-state residents, 
and in theory bolster the state 
economy post-graduation. 

The proportion of out-of-state 
offers has increased dramati-
cally in the past few years. This 
year, just 76.7 percent of students 
admitted to UCSD are in-state 
as opposed to 89.4 percent two 
years ago, according to UCOP. 
Other UC campuses range from 
UC Berkeley’s 68.8 percent  to 
Merced’s 97.4 percent. The 
UC-wide admission rate for out 
of state students rose from 8.7 
percent in 2010 to 10.7 percent 
this year. 

Out-of-state students who can 
afford to pay full-price for a UC 
education — or about $22,878 
more than residents do — usu-

ally have the financial means to 
pay for education at almost any 
university, public or private, in 
the nation. 

The UC system’s first duty is 
ostensibly to serve as many qual-
ified state residents as possible. 
Increasing non-resident rates, 
while keeping overall acceptance 
rates stable, means less offers to 
those who may not have other 
options for higher education.

But when push comes to 
shove, and we’re looking at a 
just-finalized budget that slashes 
$500 million from the UC sys-
tem for the 2011-12 academic 
year (and which will doubtless 
be coupled with further tuition

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
On April 4, 28 UCSD professors 

took out a paid advertisement in 
the Guardian entitled “An Open 
Letter…About Troubling Hypocrisy 
on Our Campus.” In their “Open 
Letter,” these professors resorted to 
an inflammatory attack on three 
student organizations, the Muslim 
Student Association, Students for 
Justice in Palestine and the Arab 
Student Union, insisting — with-
out evidence — that these student 
groups are driven by “hateful 
impulses” and charging them with 
selectively targeting Israel for criti-
cism without critiquing other human 
rights abuses in the world.    

It is no secret that the Israeli/
Palestinian conflict has emerged 
as a flashpoint about the meaning 
of academic freedom at UCSD and 

the timing of this “Open Letter” is 
no mystery.  It is a response to last 
year’s extremely successful “Justice 
in Palestine Week,” organized by the 
student groups mentioned above 
and partially funded by UCSD’s own 
Associated Students (AS). Indeed, 
the event compelled our community 
to ask important questions about the 
military occupation of Palestine and 
Palestinian resistance to occupation.  

The signatories of the “Open 
Letter” apparently hope to strike a 
pre-emptive blow against this year’s 
“Justice in Palestine Week” sched-
uled for later this term by vilifying 
those student organizations associ-
ated with this event, and accusing 
them of harboring hate. The ques-
tion to ask here is who is actually 
inflaming emotions on this issue? It 
appears that the professors’ signa-
tory to the “Open Letter” are seeking 
to place important questions about 
the Israel/Palestine conflict outside 
the boundaries of free and open 

discourse. 
We, the undersigned professors at 

UCSD, believe it is our responsibility 
and the responsibility of the univer-
sity to promote the principle of aca-
demic freedom on our campus and 
protect the rights of those members 
of our community whose activities 
contribute to this ideal. While we 
recognize the rights of members of 
our community to criticize the ideas 
of others, we deplore unsubstantiat-
ed attacks on individuals and groups 
— especially students — whose 
opinions challenge mainstream and 
dominant perspectives. It is through 
reasoned arguments about the world, 
protected by academic freedom, that 
our campus becomes a richer learn-
ing environment for all of us.

Dear Editor,
Christians United for Israel at 

UCSD agrees with and supports the 
statement made in the open letter 
about hypocrisy in the treatment of 
Israel on campus.  Israel is not and 
should not be placed on a pedestal 
and held beyond reproach, for no 
nation can be perfect, as nations are 
made up of people and people are 
not perfect.  On the contrary, Israel’s 
policies should be closely examined.  
However, Israel ought not to be 
treated with any more or less scrutiny 
than any other nation in the area.   
     We, as a university campus, must 
dedicate ourselves to intellectual hon-
esty in pursuit of liberty and peace for 
all peoples in the Middle East.  This is 

why the outrage some campus orga-
nizations have expressed against the 
letter is misplaced.  The letter is not 
hateful or even pro-Israel as such, but 
rather calls for fairness.  It is not only 
an exercise of the right to free speech, 
but is also the exact type of speech we 
should all demand from one another.

— The CUFI Officer Board
 
Dear Editor,
      I was pleasantly surprised when 
I opened the Guardian on Monday 
and found the open letter concern-
ing the hypocrisy of Israeli apartheid 
week. 
     Only in an institution as morally 
bankrupt as the American university 
could people honestly believe that 
Israel (and by association the United 
States) are agents of evil and injustice 
in this world and the Middle East. In 
all honesty, these nations are perhaps 
the primary forces of good on this 
planet. Hopefully, this letter serves 
as a catalyst for change and ends the 
MSA, SJP, and ASU’s insidious use of 
“human rights” as intellectual weap-
ons used in the propagation of 
hate. 
     In the end, peace between Israel 
and its Arab neighbors will come 
about only through true mutual 
understanding, not through the hate-
ful propaganda which characterizes 
apartheid week.  Thank you to the 
professors for showing the courage 
to point-out this inconvenient truth.

Sophomore, Marshall College

THe MenTal FisHbowl By Alex Nguyen

Clearing Space for Non-Residents is the Lesser of  Two Evils
hikes), admitting more out-of-state 
students may be the lesser of two 
evils.

The increase in 
out-of-state admits for 
UCSD — 4,419 under-
grads for 2011-12, 
compared to 2,874 for 
the current academic 
year — could provide 
a comfortable defense 
against the $60-million 
cut UCSD is projected 
to take come fall. 

These changes aren’t unprec-
edented — at the University of 
Michigan, a model of privatization 
among public universities, only 66 
percent of the student population are 

state residents. 
And although admitting more 

out-of-state students and raising 
students fees are not 
mutually exclusive 
options, the former is 
still preferable: It chief-
ly affects those who 
are willing, and able, 
to bear the increased 
financial burden. In 
contrast, student fees 
hikes to the tune of 
40-percent in two years 
affect most every UC 

student.
Of course, the increasing privati-

zation of the university can’t be said 
to affect only those taking on the 
brunt of the financial burden. This 

shift will significantly reduce access 
to the UC system for in-state stu-
dents, as they’re increasingly nudged 
out to make room for those who can 
afford to pay more. 

While clearing some sapce for 
out-of-state students may be the 
least harmful option at present, it 
also signifies a definite shift toward 
privatization. 

What’s worse, it’s a step even fur-
ther away from the California Master 
Plan for Higher Education — which, 
in 1960, imagined a UC system that 
offered a world-class college educa-
tion for next to no money to every 
qualified California resident that 
wanted one. In light of this admis-
sions report, that vision’s begun to 
seem as much a pipe dream as ever.

the increasing 
privatization of the 
university can’t 
be said to affect 
only those taking 
on the brunt of the 
financial burden.

C ritics can never seem to figure out whether the traditional sitcom is actually dead. While one news 
outlet may claim that hour-long serial 
dramas are the new big thing (read: 

“Heroes” and all its terrible spawns — 
“No Ordinary Family,” “Journeyman”), 
others praise the Big Three for shows 
like “30 Rock” and “Modern Family.”   
    Personally, I love half-hour comedies. 
It’s the perfect length of time for a study 
break, and it doesn’t require the atten-
tion of “Lost” or “Chuck.” And unlike 
those serial dramas, I don’t feel bad for 
not religiously following the show dur-
ing midterm season (i.e., weeks two to 
10).  
    Fans of sitcoms love them because 
they’re so easy to watch — after a long 
day of enduring classes, work and the 
Sprinkles cupcake line, it can be pretty 
exhausting to stomach Meredith Grey’s 
soliloquies (“Pick me. Choose me. Love 
me.”)

Plus, sitcoms are endlessly re-
watchable. Instead of having to follow 
a certain plot line through to the end, 
they’re easy to jump into. Networks 
love sitcoms because they are (rela-
tively) cheap to produce and are cash 
cows: they can show them, in any 
order, over and over again in any time 
slot.   
    And amidst the endless reruns of 
sitcom royalty like “Seinfeld” and 
“Friends,” a wealth of comedy shows 
have recently cropped up on cable TV 
and gained large followings.

“The Big Bang Theory,” in particular, 
has hit its stride. When the show first 
aired, I immediately wrote it off for its 
formulaic premise — the shenanigans of 
four awkward geeks and a cute blonde 
— and its laugh track. It took a flight 
from Hong Kong to San Francisco for 
me to finally, begrudgingly, sit through 
an episode (it was either that or studi-
ously ignore my seat neighbor’s silent 
but deadly flatulence). 

Watching Sheldon Cooper arrange 
his cereal in order of fiber content 
made the 13 hours surprisingly bear-
able. Sure, the show is goofy and 
predictable, but that’s where most of 
its charm resides. Every minute of the 
show is replete with references to geek 
pop culture, from guest appearances by 
“Firefly” star Summer Glau to madcap 
games (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, 
Spock, anyone?).

Oftentimes, the show is carried 
along by the nerdy, awkward and 
completely awesome ramblings of 
Cooper (the originator of most of 
these games). Cooper’s presence would 
probably be overbearing, a la Barney 
Stinson (“How I Met Your Mother”) if 
he weren’t just so amusing. 

And a choice aspect of the show 
is its development of relationships. 
Whether it’s the strange but ador-
able friendship between Penny and 
Sheldon, or the creepy, equally ador-
able bromance between Raj and 
Wolowitz, the show taps into a human 
element that fans come back to week 
after week. 

Oh, and I guess it doesn’t hurt that 
the show has one of the best theme 
songs/opening sequences ever pro-
duced, thanks to the musical stylings of 
the Barenaked Ladies.

Documentary Teaches 
How to Sell Out

“Super Size Me” director takes on product placement 
and pomegranates. By Rusteen Honardoost

M organ Spurlock is no Michael Moore, but he isn’t trying to be. The “Super Size Me” director is 
funny, with a humor that doesn’t distract 
from his message (And both Democrats 

and Republicans can 
appreciate his work). 
But with his new film, 
“The Greatest Movie 
Ever Sold,” Spurlock 
has traded French fries 
for another familiar 
subject: product place-
ment. 

Product placement has become 
increasingly impossible to ignore. When 
James Bond drives his Aston Martin or 
the “American Idol” judges drink from 
Coca-Cola emblazoned cups, you can’t 
help but do a double take.

Spurlock asks, and the documentary 

focuses on, the influence these corpora-
tions have in the filmmaking process. The 
answer: More than they should, but only 
because they’re trying to get their money’s 
worth — after all, these companies are 
breaking the bank for their products to 
be filmed, effectively becoming a central 
source of funding for TV shows and 
movies. 

In fact, in a sly twist of irony, 
Spurlock’s own film is no exception: The 
director convinced 15 companies to cover 
the reported $1.5 million budget through 
product placement.

POM Wonderful, a privately owned 
beverage maker, for instance, paid $1 mil-
lion to be included in the documentary’s 
marquee, making the full, official title of 
the film “POM Wonderful Presents: The

every schmuck 
has his hat
an accessory, a golem and a wall 
bring a bickering yiddish couple 
together in delightful new mFa play. 
By Ren Ebel • Associate Hiatus Editor

Q
uirky used 
to be so easy. 
Clever genre-
bending or 

unorthodoxy was 
once enough to sate 
the indie masses, 
but now, a thou-
sand and one DIY 
Gondry rip-offs and 
glockenspiel-laden 
pop “gems” later, it’s difficult 
to distinguish classifications 
like “surrealist comedy” from 
vibrant, rambling self-indul-
gence. 

Thankfully, every now and 
then there comes an exception.

Case in point: “A Man, His 
Wife and His Hat.” One of the 
more buzzed-about produc-
tions of this year’s Baldwin 

New Play Festival, 
the play centers on 
a treacherous love 
triangle among man, 
woman and inanimate 
accessory. (And with 
a bipolar golem made 
of garbage and a talk-
ing, omnipotent “wall 
of truth,” the comedy 
clearly set its sights on 

lovable oddity from the get-go.) 
But where so many others 

have struggled to find sub-
stance in the cute or bizarre, 
“A Man, His Wife and His Hat” 
employs an endearing cast and 
surprisingly cohesive script to 
produce the feel-good absurdist 
hit of the year.

Greatest Movie Ever Sold.” JetBlue, for 
its part, made sure interviews took place 
either in their airport terminals or on 
their own planes.

Using product placement to explore 
the dangers of product placement might 
seem too meta a ploy, but Spurlock pulls 
it off. The clever blurring of the lines 
keeps us invested in Spurlock’s narrative 
while also teaching us the inner work-
ings of the advertising machine. 

A particularly affecting moment 
comes with a trip to a psychoanalysis 
agency that runs tests in the vein of “A 
Clockwork Orange,” monitoring brain 
patterns using MRI machines. The 
results of Morgan’s tests show dopamine 
releases after watching a Coca-Cola 
commercial. “That’s addiction right 
there,” the technician explained. 

But even with such showmanship, 
Spurlock’s latest exposé never reaches 
greatness. It rehashes the same points 
over and over, and by the end of its 
90 minutes, nothing new has been 
concluded. While the pace is nice and 
breezy, with everything happening 
in front of the cameras in a clear and 
transparent nature, the result leaves little 
room for nuance. Money matters, the 
director asserts — yet we all knew that 
already.

Still: It’s a fun and enjoyable ride 
through the world of advertising, co-
branding and product placement. It 
won’t be winning any awards, but the 
cyclical meta-ness of the film makes it 
endearing. And to Morgan’s credit, the 
heavy-handed product placement of the 
film definitely works. We can’t get POM 
out of our minds.

Narrated by the afore-
mentioned talking wall, 
the play unravels the 
story of cranky, recliner-
bound Hetchman (Daniel 
Rubiano), a retired hat 
maker who lives with his 
unhappy wife (Natalie 
Birriel). When his wife and 
beloved hat both go miss-
ing, Hetchman enlists the 
help of his happy-go-lucky 
neighbor Meckel (Matt 
MacNelly) and an impul-
sive cellar-dwelling golem 
(Kyle Sorensen) to track 
them down, rekindling his 
love for his long-ignored 
wife in the process. 

First and foremost, the 
play is damn funny — and 
not lukewarm, drama 
geek funny. Playwright 
Lauren Yee’s script is brim-
ming with earnest laughs, 
delivering a steady stream 
of priceless moments 
from beginning to end. 
Hetchman’s love letter to 
his missing hat begins: 
“Dear Hat, if you are read-

ing this ... Hey! You can 
read!” Later, during the 
play’s penultimate epiphany 
scene, a now-domesticated 
golem slams a keg of 
Heineken during a grave-
yard séance.  

But despite the sheer 
insanity, “A Man” remains 
focused. The creative 
staff — made up entirely 
of MFA students — exude 
expert resourcefulness 
under the constraints of 
a low-budget production. 
The sets are cozy and 
minimal, rarely venturing 
outside Hetchman’s clut-
tered apartment. A meager 
cast of six (seven, including 
the wall) carries the dense, 
experimental plot single-
handedly. Yet thanks to 
the boundless talent of the 
actors and director Joshua 
Brody, the play never loses 
its audience. 

The real star, however, 
is Yee. While the award-
winning script is not with-
out its inventive flourishes 
(Hetchman’s television 

plays a documentary about 
his wife’s growing dissat-
isfaction, the golem roots 
through the basement to 
uncover dusty jars contain-
ing memories), Yee’s scope 
is limited to a few funda-
mental themes (namely, 
love and the importance of 
reciprocating it). 

The finale, which could 
just as easily have collapsed 
under the weight of the 
play’s delightful irrational-
ity, manages to navigate 
heartfelt sincerity without 
compromising the script’s 
intelligence. As Hetchman 
becomes aware of his love 
for his wife, he frantically 
recites an impromptu list 
of evidence that they are in 
love, including some sin-
cere, if slightly off-putting 
proclamations: “I say I have 
to fart when I have to fart” 
and “I hold your purse 
when you use the toilet.” 
The sentiments echo Yee’s 
script: sweet, but never 
disarmingly so, and always 
unshakably honest.

FREE EVENT! 

B ird-Brains, the ram-bunctious 2009 debut album of Tune-
Yards’ Merrill Garbus, is 
a notable example of the 
creative heights that can 
be achieved in the absence 
of formality and restraint: 
Guitars flailed grace-
lessly over poorly recorded 
drums, and every aspect of 
the recording was bathed in 
a tinny layer of digital dis-
tortion, while the shoddy 
atmospherics provided the 
perfect sonic foundation for 
Garbus’ ramshackle songs; 
all this creates a compel-
ling, unlikely tension 
between order and disorder 
that’s become the basis of 
her sound.

Though the recording 
quality is miles better than 
anything off Bird-Brains, 
WhoKill preserves the 
beauty-through-ugliness 
aesthetic of the earlier 
album. This approach is 
perhaps best summarized 
in the manic spoken-word 
interjection (a common fea-
ture of WhoKill) on stand-
out “Riotriot”: “There is a 
freedom in violence that 
I don’t understand,” cries 
Garbus. “And like I’ve never 
felt before.”

Indeed, WhoKill is 
characterized more than 

anything by its aggression. 
Lead single “Bizness” is an 
excellent embodiment of 
this approach: a prominent 
bass riff is accompanied 
by vaguely tribal drum-
ming, Garbus’ ever-ecstatic 
yelping and, eventually, a 
fantastic saxophone barrage 
that wouldn’t sound out of 
place in sax legend John 
Coltrane’s Ascension. While 
Coltrane’s heady brand of 
free jazz is a far cry from 
Garbus’ earnest blasts of 
sound, the two share a will-
ingness to abandon estab-
lished formula.

Garbus does tend to 
stick to the same basic 
elements: distorted, ’90s 
radio-rock guitar, unabash-
edly loose bass work, 
layered drum loops and 
a helluva lot of scream-
singing. But whether she’s 
cooing seductively to a 
(real or imagined) lover on 
“Powa” or confessing weak-
ness on “Es-So,” Garbus 
demonstrates a mode of 
expression that’s fresher, 
more vital and — most 
importantly — more fun 
than almost anything else 
happening in indie rock 
today.

SPORTS THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

Choosing the right career requires equal partsknowledge, insight, and planning.
If you are weighing your career options, consider this:
U.S. News & World Report places pharmacy on its 2010

short list of Best Careers — and
ranks the University of Michigan
College of Pharmacy one of the
best in the nation.

Every year, UCSD graduates form
a large share of our entering 
Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)
class. Their undergraduate majors

range from biology and chemistry to psychology and
anthropology; international studies and sociology to
English and education.

Upon graduation, 100 percent of our PharmD 
graduates find well-paying careers in health care,
higher education, the pharmaceutical and biotech-
nology industries, managed care, hospital and 
community practice, publishing, and many other
fields.

If you have an interest in patient care and the many
exciting career opportunities pharmacy can offer you,
we invite you to learn more about Michigan’s PharmD
program at:

The Southern California Pre-Pharmacy Symposium;
Saturday, April 23, 2011; 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m. on the

Great Futures Begin Here

Life’s Great Journeys Begin 
with a Single Step

were just two minutes left, but by the 
time the smoke settled on the first half, 
the Wolverines had a 6-4 lead going 
into halftime.

“We were able to put away our 
shots in the first quarter, but we 
didn’t do that in the second quarter,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “Sometimes they go, 
sometimes they don’t. That has made 
a big difference in a lot of our games.”

Defense continued to dominate at 
the start of the second half, as neither 
team could get a shot past the goal 
posts for the first four minutes. But 
after an ejection for rough play from 
the Wolverines, senior attacker Felicia 
Orozco scored to pull the Tritons with-
in one goal, but Michigan responded 
immediately, taking a two-goal lead 
into the fourth quarter.

The Wolverines scored two quick 
goals to break open a four-goal lead 
at the start of the fourth quarter. But 
within 35 seconds, both Lizotte and 
junior hole set Kirsten Bates scored to 
bring the lead back to two with over 
five minutes to play. Despite some 
urgent play, the Triton defense couldn’t 
contain the Wolverines and Michigan 
scored two goals within a minute of 
each other to further separate the 
teams. The Tritons fell for the second 
time to the Wolverines, 11-7. 

“We thought that our first strat-
egy against them was pretty good,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “We wanted to press 
them and make them play a lot of 
defense, and hope for a little better 
conversion on our 6-on-5, but that 
didn’t happen.”

The Tritons fall to 14-17 overall 
and 0-14 against ranked opponents. 
Due to a 9-1 conference record, how-
ever, the Tritons will take the second 
seed in the WWPA championships, 
which will take place from Friday, 
April 29 to Sunday, May 1. But before 
they can worry about conference tour-
naments, the Tritons have one last goal 
for the regular season. Next weekend, 
the Tritons will travel to cross-town 
rival San Diego State to try to win back 
the Harper Cup.  

“San Diego State really prepares us 
for conference,” Kreutzkamp said. “If 
we can hang with or beat San Diego 
State, then it bodes well for us going 
into conference.”

one to forget for the Tritons, as they 
lost 0-9. No. 1 singles player Taskeen 
Bains missed her singles match due to 
a foot injury.

“We certainly didn’t get the result 
we were hoping for today, that’s for 
sure,” head coach Liz LaPlante said. 
“We were getting ready for our 
match on Saturday, but that’s a much-
improved team and they were ready 
to play.”

On Saturday, the Tritons defeated 
Cal State LA 5-4 at home to improve to 
9-7 on the season. Melissa Breisacher, 
Samantha Yeung, Katie Mulloy and 
Jacquelyn Davis all won their singles 
matches for the comeback victory after 
the team managed just one doubles 
victory, which came from Cindy Dao 
and Davis 8-4.

Yeung played the final match of the 
day and won to clinch the team victory.

“[Yeung] played great under pres-
sure, the best I’ve ever seen her play, 
against a very strong opponent,” 
LaPlante said.

The Tritons finish up the regular 
season on Thursday against Sonoma 
state, before NCAA II West Regionals 
first and second rounds start on May 1.

Winning is the most important 
thing to most athletes, and that side-
lines the fun aspect of sports. However, 
fun is what I strive for, balanced with 
success. Sitting on the sidelines for 
me is not fun. My competitive nature 
wants to be out there with my team. 
I would honestly do every event out 
there on the track if my coaches let me. 

But that wouldn’t really help. 
I would be taking spots away from 
people who do those things better. I 
do what I can.

So what do you do when you’re 
injured? Smile and put on a happy face 
for your team? Take stats? Or get back 
on the field to play your position?

The answer is frustrating: You help 
your team however you can. 

Most of the time, that means not 
taking that extra shot or doing that last 
drill that the rest of your team is doing. 
The answer is sitting out this game and 
getting better so you can help your 
team when it counts. Aggravating an 
injury in a game that doesn’t matter — 
ruling you out of an important game 
— is perhaps more frustrating than the 
original injury.

For me, this means sitting out of 
the Triton Invitational on Saturday, 
even though Mike Hazle — the top 
American javelin thrower last year 
— will be there. I am sitting out the 
opportunity to throw in front of the 
German national coach, and the 

female athlete he is accompanying, 
who’s throwing near the American 
record. I am going to be watching, 
filming, getting the officials their food 
and taking stats. 

This frustrates the flying F-bomb 
out of me. But watching these great 
athletes is going to be an immense 
thrill, and UCSD students shouldn’t 
miss a chance to see some of the best 
— several former Olympic athletes 
will be there, and several others likely 
to qualify for the London games in 
2012.

I’m skipping this to get to my ver-
sion of the ALCS. I need to do well 
at the conference and national meets. 
This meet, as exciting as it will be, and 
as much as I am itching to go, would 
not help me get as well as I can before 
those competitions. If I am bleeding, 
I cannot perform my best, just as 
Schilling probably would have pitched 
better if he hadn’t been bleeding all 
over the mound. 

So, as annoying as it is, I will not 
be competing, but come to the Triton 
Invite this Saturday anyway to see 
some intense international competi-
tion. The Brazilian national team will 
be here, along with some German 
throwers, British Olympic hopefuls, 
American front-runners and top col-
legiates from around the country. 

The Triton Invitational will be at 
Spanos Track all day on Saturday, April 
23.

The No. 20 Tritons fell to No. 6 Michigan for the second time this season, leaving the team 0-14 against ranked teams.

Associate Sports Editor

WOMEN’S WATERPOLO — Another hat trick 
from freshman Sarah Lizotte wasn’t enough to 
power the No. 20 UCSD women’s water polo 
team past No. 6 Michigan, and the Tritons fell 
11-7 to the Wolverines for the second time this 
season on Saturday. The Tritons first played 
against Michigan University at the UC Santa 
Barbara tournament in their first official game 
of the season, and fell by a score of 11-8. 

The game was intensely physical and saw 
17 ejections. The Tritons took advantage, scor-
ing the majority of their goals with the 6-on-5 
opportunities. 

“We worked really hard this week on our 
6-on-5, hoping that would play into our hands, 
but it didn’t,” head coach Brad Kreutzkamp said. 

“We got great shot opportunities, but we just 
didn’t convert. That was the difference in the 
game.”

The Tritons came into the match looking 
for their first win this season against a ranked 
opponent, and set the tempo early. UCSD struck 
first in the match when Lizotte scored her first of 
three goals, but the lead vanished quickly as the 
Wolverines scored the next three goals before 
the Tritons recovered. The Tritons added two 
more goals in the final two minutes of the quar-
ter, however, to even the score at three. 

The second quarter opened slowly, with 
neither team mounting much offense. Michigan 
struck three minutes in, which opened a torrent 
of goals for the visiting Wolverines. The Tritons 
didn’t score in the second quarter until there

TENNIS — After a brief break, the UCSD men’s 
tennis team continued its unbeaten season, 
defeating Concordia University Irvine and Point 
Loma Nazarene last week.

Against Concordia Irvine, Erik Elliott con-
tinued his strong season as the No. 1 singles 
player with a comeback victory against Kareem 
Berdai, 0-6, 6-2, 6-0. Chapman Chan, Junya 
Yoshida, Vincent Nguyen and Austin West all 
won their singles matches to secure the match 
for the Tritons.

“It was a good win, getting the rust off,” head 
coach Eric Steidlmayer said.

Elliott and West won their doubles match 
in thrilling fashion, pulling out the victory 9-8. 
Armaun Emami and Max Jiganti added another 
doubles victory 8-3, to give the Tritons seven 
victories in nine matches on the day.

“We’re doing better than we’ve ever done,” 
Chan said.

On Tuesday, the Tritons moved to 17-0, 
defeating Point Loma Nazarene 6-3.  Elliott 
continued his sparkling play and won the No. 1 
singles match, 7-5, 6-7, 7-6, while Nguyen, West 
and Jiganti also won their singles matches. West 
remained undefeated in singles matches.

Elliott and West won their doubles match 8-6, 
and the Emami and Jiganti pair contributed a 
doubles victory from the third spot at 8-5. 

“That’s a good team over there and it was 
nice to get a win to start off this stretch of four 
matches in five days,” Steidlmayer said.

The Tritons finish up the regular season this 
week at Rohnert Park with the Sonoma State 
Invitational. Starting Thursday, the Tritons play 

Hawaii Hilo, Grand Canyon and Sonoma State 
over three days. The team is currently ranked No. 
10 overall and No. 1 in the NCAA West Region.

The UCSD women’s team — ranked No. 17 
in the country — fell to Point Loma Nazarene 
last week, but came back to defeat Cal State Los 
Angeles 5-4 on Saturday.

Erik Elliott won both of his singles matches, as well as both his 
doubles matches partnered with Austin West.

By now, the bloody sock of pitcher Curt Schilling is the stuff of legend for Red Sox fans. In 2004, Boston won 
the American League Division Series to put 
away the decades-old “Curse of the Bambino.” 
Schilling had just had surgery on his ankle, 
yet he was there, in a must-win game, putting 
the victory in the bag. Playing through injury 
is a touchy subject. In cases like Schilling’s, it 
was an amazing story of a player doing what 
needed to get done to win. It was similar to 
Jordan scoring 60 points in the playoffs with 
a severe cold. 

But more often than not, playing hurt makes 
things worse. What you may not remember is 
that the first bloody sock Schilling suffered 
cost the Red Sox game one in the ALCS. And 
Brett Favre, the toughest man on the planet, 
bar none, has played through some injuries — 
like a broken finger — to the chagrin of his fans 
everywhere.

So the question begs to be asked: When do 
you compete injured? When can you actually 
contribute to the victory, rather than lead to 
the defeat because of your impediment?

I’ve had to deal with this myself recently, 
not for the first time. I am hurt. I’ve realized 
that during these times that I am self-centered. 
It’s hard not to be when you go from the heights 
of winning to the lows of injury and sitting out 
during competitions. There is a limit on how 
excited you can be for your teammates. If they 
win the competition, everyone is ecstatic, and 
the coach is happy with everyone else’s perfor-
mance, personal records, high scores and large 
margins of victory. 

But during all that, you sat on the sideline. 
You took down those very stats, counting the 
amazing tallies with small ticks on the sheet of 
paper in front of you. 

I hate that feeling.

UCSD athletics honored its own in a ceremony last Thursday, but the ceremony wasn’t for 
accomplishments on the playing field. In 
conjunction with the NCAA-sponsored 
National Student-Athlete Day, the uni-
versity commended the Tritons with the 
highest achievements in the classroom. 

“It’s another opportunity for us to 
showcase what we stand for when we say 
student-athletes,” athletics director Earl 
Edwards said. “For me, it’s a chance to 
show off the total package of academics, 
athletics and community service.”

The reception was held on the 15th 
floor of Building One in the Village, 
which offers sweeping views of the cam-
pus, Torrey Pines Gold Course and the 
Pacific Ocean. It was the 10th anni-
versary of the event, and the athletics 
department invited several past winners 
to take part. 

Faculty Athletic Representative Cliff 
Kubiak gave the keynote address. Former 
UCSD softball player and 2008 honoree 
Randelle Bundy, honoree and water polo 
player Ryan Allred and Edwards also 
spoke during the event. 

“Personally, it means a great deal to 
be standing next to the people that were 
honored tonight,” Allred said. “There are 
a lot of really talented athletes but also of 
very smart individuals.”

Allred, an Eleanor Roosevelt College 
senior and urban studies and planning 
major, maintains a 3.89 GPA.

“Our slogan is ‘a proud tradition of 
academic and athletic excellence,’” Allred 
said. “And that’s definitely the way it 
should be. It’s something I take a lot 
of pride in. Walking into a water polo
