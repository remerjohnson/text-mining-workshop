WASHINGTON - Despite 
the acrimony between congres-

House, the Clinton administra-
tion emerged relatively 
unscathed after several days of 
hearings last week into allega-

money laundering at the Bank of 
New York. 

The Republicans did not sur-
face with ammunition that some 
had hoped could be used in the 
campaign season. " I don't think

Move In: A Falnily Affair 
HOUSING: Newly-arrived students find rooms less cramped than last year 
I, VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

Fewer students than last 
year are living in temporary 
university housing. 

Housing and Dining 
Services Director Larry Barrett 
said that over 60 students will 
be housed in temporary spaces 
this year, compared to 130 stu-

dents last year. Barrett attrib· 
uted this decline to the fact that 
transfer students are no longer 
guaranteed on-campus hous-
ing. 

Temporary living quarters 
were created in several ways. 

At Revelle college, the cor-
ner ruulI'" uf Argo and Blake 
halls will house three students 
instead of two. 

At Muir college, where only 
seven students will be housed 
in temporary spaces compared 
to 30 last year, students will be 
housed in rooms intended for 
student organizations. 

At Marshall and Warren col-
leges, temporary spaces will be 
created by housing an addition-

EDUCATION: Alvarez 
calls project a 'wonderful, 
bold, new experiment' 
By MARC COMER 
Senior Staff Writer 

With the opening of the Preuss 
School three weeks ago, UCSD 
students can now participate in a 
long-awaited outreach and 
research program. 

The Preuss School offers 
UCSD students an opportunity to 
tutor and mentor promising, mid· 
die school students and work 
with their teachers through 
UCSD's newest outreach pro-
gram. 

"I hope [UCSD) students con-
sider this a great opportunity to 
become involved in a wonderful, 
bold, new experiment that will 
really be the forerunner for other 
people to follow," said Doris 
Alvarez, principal of the Preuss 
School. 

Designed to give San Diego's 
low-income students, who might 
otherwise slip through the cracks, 
the tools to get into and succeed 
at the university level, the Preuss 
School will benefit both UCSD 
students and faculty, said Randall

UCSD Loses Two Prominent Professors. 
• , .. I D. SaItman 
By LIENA SHANKAR 
Senior Staff Writer 

Paul D. Saltman, professor 
of biology and shaper of UC5D, 
passed away on August 27 
from prostate cancer. He was 
71. 

A strong advocate of teach-
ing excellence, Sallman is 
remembered by both col-
leagues and students as a man 
who cared about others. 

HSaltman always talked 
about loving people, and peo-

pie loved him," Revelle college 
Provost Tom Bond said. "There 
are eight teaching awards on 
this campus - one from each 
college, an alumni award, the 
Chancellor's Associates and 
most distinguished, a Career 
Award from the faculty. Paul 
won all of them." 

In his 32 years of teaching at 
UCSD, Saltman impacted 
many students.

By JUUA KULLA-MADER 
Senior Staff Writer 

With rare passion and energy, 
literature Professor Sherley Anne 
Williams spent 54 years traveling 
from the impoverished San 
Joaquin Valley to wealthy La 
Jolla, always reflecting on her 
path through writing and teach-
ing. 

For 26 years, Williams 
enriched UCSD as a poet, author, 
professor and student advocate. 
Outside of campus, she was best 

known for writing Dessa Rose, a 
staple in African American litera-
ture courses. 

The child of field workers 
who died before she reached 
adulthood, Williams spent her 
adolescence picking cotton and 
fruit . She discovered her love of 
the written word as a high school 
student while reading African 
American biographies.

The uc San Diego Foundation presented three

University House. 

Jerome Katzin was named outstanding trustee, 
Sam and Rose Stein were recognized as individual 
contributors and the Walton Family Foundation was 
honored for excellency as a foundation/institutional 
supporter. 

The name, Civis Universitatis, meaning ·citizen of 
the university," derives from ancient times when uni-

versities actually were small, distinct communities iso-
lated from towns. Citizenship in the universities was 
highly valued and was achievable only after long years 
of scholarship. By bestowing the award, the university 
signifies that it is inducting the recipients into the 
UCSD family.

SALTMAN: 
Professor was a 

. noted nutritionist 
ContIIIued "... ..... Ai 
wasn't really motivated but when 
I met Dr. Saltman, he inspired me 
with his excitement and passion," 
said Lauge Farnaes, a 1999 UCSD 
graduate and current UCSD mas-
ters student. "1 would be sur-
prised if there are 500 people 
alive in the United States today 
that have a personal legacy like 
he does. Anything that I accom-
plish in my life is largely due to 
Dr. Saltman and I don't think I'm 
the only person to feel this way." 

Famaes was a teaching assis-
tant for Saltman's metabolic 
chemistry class. 

"Dr. Saltman called his TAs his 
colleagues," he said. "We even 
went to his house and his wife 
cooked us dinner." 

Stuart Brody, a UCSD biology 
professor, also said he saw that 
Saltman's first priority was 
always students. 

"His door was always open 
and there was always candy for 
students to munch on sitting on 
his desk," Brody said. "You could 
hardly find a time that his office 

WILLIAMS: 
Author came to 
UCSD in 1973 

to express," she told the Los 
Angeles Times in a 1986 interview. 
"I remember walking through the 
shelves in the library one day, try-
ing to see if I could tell by the title 
of the books if they were about 
black people, because I was too 
embarrassed to ask the librarian. 
I mean, what if there were no 
books? So by that, I came upon 
Richard Wright's Black Boy and 
Eartha Kilt's Thursday 's Clrild. It 
was largely through these autobi-
ographies I was able to take heart 
in my life." 

In addition to Wright and Kit!, 
Williams' literary influences 
included Amiri Baraka, Sterling 
Brown, Langston Hughes and the 
poet Philip Levine, her professor 
at Fresno State University. 

Shortly after Williams' death, 
her literary agent, Sandra 
Dijkstra, received a letter from 
Levine. 

"You had to love her: indepen-
dent, self-invented, brilliant, gen-
erous and full of faith in the right-
eousness of life," he wrote. "A 
beautiful person."

was not filled with students. He 
had high standards and always 
challenged his colleagues to do a 
better job at teaching 'and public 
service for the university." 

Immo Scheffler, a UCSD pro-
fessor of biology, said that 
Saltman placed students .first 
even in his dying days. 

"A few days before his death, I 
saw him shuffling in pain in the 
parking lot and I asked him what 
he was doing there," Scheffler 
said. "He said he had a couple 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson was Third 
(now Marshall) college provost in 
1973, when Williams was hired as 
UCSD's first African American 
literature professor after receiv-
ing her M.A. from Brown 
University. 

"It was an extremely impor-
tant appointment for us," Watson 
said. "With Sherley we had an 
individual who taught the cours-
es with a passion, and outreached 
not only to the students here on 
campus, but to the community in 
a major way. She really made a

more letters of recommendation 
to finish up for his students." 

Not only successful in work-
ing with students and colleagues, 
Saltman excelled in his work as a 
nutritionist, researcher, innovator 
and UCSD administrator. 

He wrote Ti,e UCSD Nutritioll 
Book, which is tailored to the gen-
eral public and can be found in 
bookstores throughout the coun-
try. 

Bond said that Saltman was 
never afraid to express hiS views 
regarding food . 

"Everyone knows that 
Saltrnan said if you were going to 
eat only one thing, eat pizza or 
twinkies rather than apples -
pizza and twinkies are more bal-
anced," Bond said. 

Saltman initiated a parents' 
orientation program that has 
been copied nationally. He also 
recognized the importance of K-
12 education long before it came 
to the forefront of UCSD interest. 

"He procured money which 
allowed him to set up a program 
where K-12 teachers could come 
to the UCSD campus in the sum-
mers and learn more about sci-
ence and research," Scheffler 
said.

. contribution to the campus by 
making African American litera-
ture a lively presence." 

In her early days at UCSD, 
Williams played a key role in 
bringing artists such as Miles 
Davis, Maya Angelou, Eartha Kitt 
and Ruby Dee to campus, accord-
ing to Theater Professor Floyd 
Gaffney, who directed the 
Contemporary Black Arts pro-
gram with her. 

"She was instrumental in 
terms of keeping in contact with 

. the black academic community 
across the country, especially 
with those people at the forefront 
of hterature and writing," 
Gaffney said. U And in bringing 
in African American students, 
both at the undergraduate and 
graduate level who had an inter-
est and who were attuned to liter-
ature." 

Throughout her academic 
career, Williams pushed UCSD's 
literature department to diversify 
and take the needs of students 
into account. 

"Sherley Anne Williams really 
fought hard and against a lot of 
odds to make the literature 
department a very diverse place 
to be in terms of faculty, in terms 
of students and in terms of cur-

Cliques Divide Campus 
COMMENTARY: Homogeneous groups create racial and social problems 

'it- KRISHNEIL MAHARAJ 
Staff Writer 

Each year, at the begin-
ning of fall quarter, I get 
this uncontrollable surge of 
optimism. I envision all the 
things I'll do this year that I 
haven't done in the past. 
For instance, I dream about 
how I will get stellar 
grades, or how I'll say hello 
to all those people that I 
pass by in the library, or 
how I'll contribute more to 
this campus than my phys-
ical presence. 

But alas, the dream of 
good grades is usually 
shattered by the time third 
or fourth week rolls 
around. I usually fail at 
saying hello to all those 
people I pass by - it's far 
too difficult to overcome 
my shyness. It's much easi-
er to just dart by with my 
head lowered, pretending I 
don't see them. 

So, that leaves just the 
third option. I've got to try 
my best to improve the 
environment at UCSD. I'm 
not talking about picking 
up trash on Library Walk-
although that would be a 
noble effort. No, I am talk-
ing about improving the 
intangibles, the things that 
no one likes to talk about. 

One thing that irks me about UCSD is the fact that 
everyone tends to congregate along racial, religious or 
some other social dividing line. The result is the forma-
tion of cliques. 

There is nothing wrong with the desire to hang out 
with people that are similar to oneself. I can relate to 
those who feel secure when surrounded by people that 
are like them - it only disturbs me when the desire for 
"sameness" becomes so great that it prohibits people get-
ting to kn('w those outside of their particular clique. 

What is happening on this campus is a type of self-
imposed segregation. The desire to be with one's "own 
kind" (whatever that is supposed to mean) translates 
into social groupings in which everyone looks, thinks 
and acts the same way. 

What scares me most, however, is the correlation 
between the lack of interaction among different groups 
on this campus and the greater racial issues that grip this 
country. Many of the problems involving race in this 

country Item from the a.ck 
of interaction between 
groups. This makes it diffi-
cult for groups to under-
stand others, which in turn 
allows stereotypes, exag-
gerations and misrepresen-
tations to fester. 

If we really want to 
overcome the daunting 
obstacles to racial harmony 
left behind by previous 
generations, then each of 
us must make a genuine 
effort to seek out and 
understand those that are 
different from ourselves. I 
am not asking everyone to 
hold hands and start 
singing - we've had plen-
ty of that and it hasn't real-
ly gotten us anywhere. 
Instead, we must start real-
izing that this campus is a 
reflection of upper middle-
class America, and that 
witn each passing year the 
lack of diversity at UCSD 
grows. Recent trends have 
served to make it harder 
and harder for the disad-
vantaged to get into insti-
tutions like UCSD. (This is 
not to be construed as sup-
port for affirmative action. 
A doctor cannot cure can-
cer with a band-aid, so it is 
unfair to expect a stopgap 

Kristine CIlan&/GuardJlWI measure like affirmative 
action to cure the social 

inequalities of today.) 
As public universities becomes more and more of a 

haven for upper-middle class America, this stratification 
results in the homogeneity of ideas present at UCSD and 
similar institutions. 

Explained in simpler terms: There's no way to know 
what is going on in the rest of America when the only 
people we come across are those that are doing well. 
How are we supposed to understand the predicament of 
those that are worse off than we are, when we never even 
come into contact with them? 

Through a lack of diversity and the popularity of 
cliques, college students are prevented from truly under-
standing the nature of the society we live in. Most of us 
have lived lives of relative comfort. We were admitted to 
this school and surrounded ourselves with people just 
like us and do everything in neat little social groups.

During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to microgr'avity, which leads 
to deconditioning of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems. 
Current methods of space exercise are not effective in preventing 
deconditioning. lower body negative pressure refers to a technique in 
which the pressure exerted on the lower half of the body is less than 
that exerted on the upper half. In this study, microgravity is simulated 
by 30 days of bed rest in six degrees of head down tilt. Exercise is 
performed while lying down partially inside a chamber. The pressure 
in the chamber will be slowly reduced until it equals the force gravity 
exerts on your body while standing up. Exercise consists of running on 
an upright treadmill for 40 minutes 6 days a week. 

During the study we will test your muscle strength, exercise tolerance, 
ability to stand upright, balance and gait, sprint speed, spinal compression, 
bone denSity, gastrOintestinal function, sleep quality, knee ligament laxity, 
intracranial pressure, brain blood Row, arterial elasticity, and changes 
in daily weight. Most of these measures are done noninv~sively. Plasma 
volume and serum bone markers will require blood draws to be done 
weekly througho.ut the study. All of the above tests will be done during 
a 3 day control period before the start of bed rest, and repeated during 
a 3 day recovery period after bed rest. Some tests will also be performed 
during the bed rest portion of the study. This study requires that you be 
confined within UCSD Medical Center's Clinical Research Center.

Gr~duates and-Moving Students-Collide 
COMMENTARY: Poor planning for last year's ceremony caused unnecessary trouble for students 
By TOMMY W 

Staff~er 

As an incoming freshman in 
the 1997-98 school year, one word 
I often heard was "respect." The 
seniors running freshman orien-
tation, the administrative staff, 
my RA, and every other person I 
spoke with somehow integrated 
this seven-letter word into nis or 
her spiel on college. 

"We, as professors, respect your 
position as students. H "The admin-
istration respects you because you 
are an aduft now and can make 
your own decisions." "The stu-
dents respect each other because 
they're all in the same boat." "The 
TAl respect your stance and will 
not grade you down because your 
analysis of 'Dr. StrangeloW' c0n-
tradicts theirs." As a naive fresh-
man. I took it all in and believed 
every word. 

Maybe I've become pessimistic. 
Entering my third year here at 
UCSD, 1 have come to acknowl-
edge that all I was told about 
respect was conditional. The 
move-out day of my second year 
at UCSD only 80Iidified this belief. 

Before I go into why I'm sore 
over this, allow me to set the 
stage. It was move-out day last 
spring quarter at the Marshall 
college upper apartments. All 
were anxious to pack their 
belongings and get the hell out of 
school. Move-out day, however, 
happened to coincide with 
Thurgood Marshall college's 
graduation ceremony. With all the 
commotion of parents going to 
their child's graduation while 
other parents helped their chil-
dren move, things were, to say 
the least, hectic. 

All this bustle and traffic was 
expected and taken with a grain 
of salt by myself and my fellow 
residents in the uppers. My ani-
mosity is directed at those in 
Marshall college who poorly 
planned the graduation and bla-
tantly disregarded the students 
moving that same day. 

The logic of having move-out 

fairly obvious that not all second-
year students would be moving 
home right away; most were mov-
ing their things to storage facili-
ties or to new apartments. Moving 
four people's entire belongings 
(and in my case, eight people's 
belongings - my roommates and 
I were helping another apartment 
move, as well) by car or van in 

The logic of having move-out day on the same day as 
graduation is beyond my understanding. It should have 
been obvious to even an entering freshman that either 
event would be more than enough to handle. 

day on the same day as gradua-
tion is beyond my understanding. 
It should have been obvious to 
even an entering freshman that 
either event would be more than 
enough to handle. Against all rea-
son, the two were scheduled on 
the same day, causing Marshall 
Lane and its cul-de-sac to be more 
clogged than 1-5 on a Friday after-
noon. Genesse Ave. and North 
Torrey Pines Road became virtual 
parking lots. 'To make things 
worse, the parking lot across from 
the Marshall uppers was closed 
to student use but reserved for 
attendants of the graduation cere-
monies, which I consider a total 
insult to students who bought 
parking permits for the year. 

What truly confounded me, 
however, was that someone 
decided to close the entire 
Thurgood Marshall college cam-
pus after noon. All entrances lead-
ing toward the Marshall college 
campus, including campus roads 
from Muir and Warren colleges, 
were blocked off by security. It's 

one trip is impossible. 
My fellow Marshall student 

and roommate Ken Hong was 
outra§ed about the entrance clo-
sure. 'We were driving around La 
Jolla for several hours, time we 
could have spent moving our 
things and finishing Up.N 

My roommates and I, along 
with our neighbors, started mov-
ing our things at 9 a.m., and we 
didn't place the last box down 
until 9 p.m. that night. 

This lack of respect for moving 
students was uncalled for and 
insulting. Students were not 
allowed to use the parking lot, for 
which they paid several hundred 
dollars in permit fees. Once off 
campus, they were not allowed to 
return to their apartments, which 
were still their homes until 
Sunday. More insulting still was 
how the security guards handled 
the situation, boSsing students 
around as if they had no right to be 
there. Part of these students' fees 
paid for the same security who 
jerked them around by a chain. 

This brings up another point 
about student fees. In the business 
world, when you pay for a product 
or service, you want to get the 
most for your dollar, and you 
expect to be treated like a valued 
customer. Students likewise expect 
a good product - quality educa-
tion - and respect. Paying $15,000 
a year to go to college should enti-
tle students to some respect. After 
paying $5,000 for on-campus hous-
ing, it shouldn't be too much to ask 
for some assistance rather than 
overburdening restrictions. I'm not 
asking to be waited on hand-and-
foot -I don't want slaves brought 
in to move our computers and 
books. But I don't want to pay 
these sizable amounts of money 
only to be treated like a second-
class citizen, either. 

Perhaps the people that orga-
nized last year's graduation will 
read this article. Perhaps this 
account will convince them to 
make changes that will make it 
easier on Marshall students still 
living on campus this year. 
Perhaps not. 

One thing is certain, however. 
Despite paying $15,000 a year to 
attend this institution, despite 
having to deal with the usual 
stress of being a student, the 
school did not think enough of U" 
to raise a finger to hefp. The 
school made the situation worse 
with poor planning and inept 
policy, which resulted in a feeling 
of disparagement. As my friend 
Chika Kawashima put it, "Hey, if 
they wanted us out in one trip, 
maybe the university could've 
rented us all a U-Haul or some-
thing." Indeed, given the situa-
tion we were in, anything would 
have helped.

By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

To all freshmen and transfer 
students, welcome to UCSD. To 
all returning students, welcome 
back. This is your newspaper; 
the Guardial/ . If you're new to 
this campus, maybe you ' ve 
heard about the paper. Maybe 
you haven't. If you ' re returning 
to UCSD, you've probably read 
it before. Whatever the case, 
hopefu lly you'll find it informa-
tive and entertaining. 

My name is Brent Don, and 
I am the Opinion Editor of the 
Guardial/ . My Associate Editor is 
Ward Han. We can be reached 
via e-mail at bdol/@ucsd.edu and 
ruahal/@ucsd.edu, respectively. 
Feel free to contact us with com-

The opinion section is prob-
ably the most accessible part of 
the paper, both for those who 
just want to read the Guardial/, 
and for those who are consider-

it is designed to be the voice of 
UCSD. The purpose of this sec-

UCSD community to discuss 
topics that affect it, whether they

readers a chance to get to know 
these writers' familiar voices. 
Currently only three of the 
columnist positions are filled; if 
you are interested in writing a 
bi-weekly column, contact us for 
further information. 

In addition to full-length 
articles, opinion also publishes 
letters to the editors. If you read 
an article in the paper that you 
disagree with, don't just throw 
the paper away in disgust and 
vow never to read it again. 
Write and submit a response to 
it so that your argument can be 
heard as well. The purpose of 
the paper is to provide a forum 
for both sides of every issue; let-
ters provide an opportunity to 
discuss these matters in a public 
dialogue that all of UCSD can 
have access to. 

Besides serving the thou-

sands of students and faculty 
who read the paper, the Guardiall 
also affords an extraordinary 
opportunity for students to be 
published. You don't have to 
work fO'r the Guardial/ to write an 
article for opinion (although if 
you do become a hired writer 
you get paid, ooo!) You don't 
have to make sure that every-
thing you write cQllforms with 
universi ty policy. You don't have 
to write something that the 
Guardiall staff agrees with. You 
don't even have to spell every-
thing correctly (we have soft-
ware that can fix that). 

All you need is an opinion 
and the desire to share it with the 
people that are partaking in 
many of the same experiences 
that you are going through at this 
school. We do not decide which 
articles to publish based on 
whether or not we agree with the 
ideology it espouses, but rather 
on the merit of its argument. 

If you would like to submit 
an article or letter to be consid-
ered for publication, it's as simple 
as sending us an e-mail. Of 
course we don't want to exclude 
people who either don't have 
access to a computer or prefer not 
to work with an electronic medi-
um, so you can always submit an 
article the old-fashioned way by 
dropping it off at the Guardial/ 
office, located on the second floor 
of the Student Center. 

Thanks for taking the time 
to read. Be sure to check back as 
often as you like, and if you feel 
the urge, please take the time to 
write and submit something. 
Hopefully this will prove to be a 
great year for all of us.

Redefining UCSl) UCSD Students Are Lucky 
COMMENTARY: UCSD needs a new mantra COMMENTARY: Private universities shelter their students from life 
By ARNEL GUIANG 
Contributing Writer 

I hereby declare UCSD a liber-
ated university. 

The beginning of a new acade-
mic year draws attention to the 
reputation and expectations of 
UCSD as a university. Applicants 
to UCSD must face strong compe-
tition, as the school slowly climbs 
the ranks as a "research" univer-
sity, winning praise and respect 
nationwide. 

While this is great, it has little 
impact on how we personally 
feel. I still find a certain ambiance 
lacking from the lives of the 
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents, and it is a lacking that 
needs to be fulfilled . 

Face it - the most exciting 
events UCSD offers are numerous 
concerts and the Sun God festival. 
On a weekly level, the most 
enjoyable thing to do is to go to 
T}, get drunk and hit on some 
SDSU chicks or guys. 

That's all great, but where are 
the liberals at? Why are there no 
animal rights activists, pro-affir-
mative action protesters and tree 
nuggers - all of which usually 
cause so much ruckus on a col-
lege campus? Why aren' t we 
questioning academia and society 
anymore? I think this is largely 
due to the conservative nature of 

perception~ of UCSD. 
We need to develop a certain 

charisma in order to redefine 
UCSD's student life. In response 
to my weariness over this issue, I 
have decided to declare our uni-
versity liberated. We are liberated 
from our past preconceptions and 
now we can redefine ourselves. 

I like the sound of that - "lib-

erated." Instead of being known 
for science or research or biology . 
or engineering, being known for 
liberation sounds so much better. 

In order to be liberated, we 
must stop being solely concerned 
with our grades and studying at 
Geisel on Friday nights. We need 
to be more outgoing and willing 
to become fully involved in stu-
dent organizations. We need to be 
more expressive and willing to 
communicate. We are not nerds 
- we are cool nerds who want to 
be movers and shakers through-
out the world. 

It is·the makeup of the student 
body that determines what is lib-
eral or moving. We are the foun-
dation of UCSO's student life, but 
some of us choose to criticize 
UCSO by saying our university is 
boring, or that there's nothing to 
do in San Diego. 

But look: We have TJ, wanna-
be poli sci lawyers, Pacific Beach 
bars, Cafe Crema, numerous 
ravers and raves, Asian racers, 
MEChA, pre-med nerds, black 
panthers, surfers, blondes and 
mobs of computer scientists that 
all make UCSO an awesome place 
to be. 

Stereotypes and reputations 
can eaSily be transformed by 
redefinition. This can happen if 
we define UCSD as a more inter-
esting and lively school. But in 
order to make this a reality, it 
requires hands-on involvement. 
We, the students, must make 
UCSD exciting and worthy rather 
than negating all that our univer-
sity has to offer. As we head into 
a new academic year and a new 
millennium, a redefinition is cer-
tainly appropriate. 

edilor@ucsdguQrdiQ'I.~rg 

~~ 
Before bestowing my dis-

putable wisdom upon the public 
at large, I'd like to extend a 
warm welcome to all new UCSD 
students. Whether you've land-
ed at our fine institution after 
countless letters of rejection 
from more reputable schools or 
have been striving for admission 
to UCSO since first grade, con-
siser yourself lucky to be attend-
ing this very large, very public 
university. Why?' Don't worry, 
I'm going to tell you. 

I recently visited my best 
friend up north at Whitworth 
College, a Christian university 
that enrolls fewer students than 
my high school. At Whitworth, 
which my friend terms as her 
"tiny Christian bubble," the 
majority of the student body has 
the same religion, background, 
race (very white) and general 
field of study. If you're looking 
for diversity, you probably won't 
find a whole lot of it. • 

This isn' t entirely bad. The 
uniformity allows students to 
learn in an environment in 
which their beliefs and 
lifestyles are not likely to be 
challenged. While this is very 
conducive to academia, it does 
not adequately prepare individ-
uals for life in the real world . 
Private colleges in general 
serve to shelter students from 
the outside world, to put them 
in a "bubble" at the expense of 
real life experience. 

Private schools were not set 

up to provide this kind of 
absence of reality. The adminis-
tration of these schools is not 
plotting to keep the student 
body uniform and without 
diversity. Unfortunately, howev-
er, because of the original pur-
pose of most private schools, it 
has unwittingly turned out that 
way. 

Most private colleges were 
founded to support a particular 
religion or viewpoint, or to pro-

Private schools were 
not set up to provide this 
kind of absence of reality. 
The administration of 
these schools is not 
plotting to keep the 
student body uniform and 
without diversity. 
Unfortunately. however. 
because of the original 
purpose of most private 
schools. it has unwittingly

vide education to a specific 
group of people, often an ethnic 
minority group. Schools further 
divide themselves along eco-
nomic lines. If you're rich, you 
go to USD. If you're smart and 
rich, you go to Harvard . If 
you're smart and Mormon, you 
go to BYU. People rarely dare to 
cross these lines. This is why 
you don't see Muslims lining up 
to attend the Christian colleges, 
or the white kids banging down 
the doors of Howard. 
Understand£!bly, people are

. ~ 

unwilling to step into a situa-
tion in which they aN different 
from everyone else. The nature 
and variety of private schools 
allows each person to choose a 
college that caters to people of 
his or her background and ide-
ology so that neither the stu-
dent's identity nor beliefs will 
be challenged in the least. Is this 
p~aration for real life? Most 
definitely not. 

Public universities are an 
entirely different story. UCSD 
was not founded to endorse a 
religion or to educate a minority. 
It, along with all other state 
schools, was constructed by the 
government to educate virtually 
anyone who wants to learn. 
Thus it attracts people irrespec-
tive of race or religion. I can 
walk down Library Walk during 
Welcome Week and see tables for 
clubs representing at least four 
major religions and at least four 
ethnic groups. Here, people have 
many different points of view, 
none of which (including mine, 
unfortunately) are endorsed by 
the university. 

Hence, if you are a UCSD stu-
dent standing up for a belief that 
the majority may disagree with, 
chances are that you have 
thought it out and truly believe 
it. It is very easy for my best 
friend to be an evangelical 
Christian at Whitworth College 
with its residential life-spon-
sored Bible studies and "chapel 
time." At UCSD, she'd have to 
fight for A.S. funding just like 
everybody else. She might even 
find people who disagreed with 
her religious views - she might

California Condors Learn 
What it Means to be Wild 

.M, UAW Hope to Reach Pact ' 
PINE MOUNTAIN CLUB, 

Calif. - Perched on a roof in this 
small wilderness community, 
California condor WO is a sight 
to behold. Weighing in at about 
20 pounds, with a wingspan 
around 9 feet and history going 
back to the time of the mastodon, 
his presence is awe-inspiring. 
But Mike Barth, a wildlife biolo-
gist, would rather he just went 
away. 

"I'm going to have to flush 
him," said Barth, a supervisory 
biol~t with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, after examining 
the bird with binoculars and 
watching it for about five min-
utes. 

Before he got the chance, how-
ever, WO obligingly lifted off and 
sailed across the valley to his 
cohorts resting on dead trees 
across the way. But chances are he 
will be back. 

Mountains about SO miles north-
west of Los Angeles. They have 
been visiting regularly over the 
last month, confounding wildlife 
officials, captivating residents 
and creating mischief by ripping 
up deck furniture, doormats and, 
in one case, tearing through a 
screen and into a bedroom. 

Once threatened with extinc-
tion, the condors are part of a 
group born in captivity after their 
dwindling numbers led officials 
to capture the last of the 
California condors in 1987. At 
that time, there were only 27 
California condors in existence. 

So successful was the breed-
ing program that officials began 
reintroducing them to the wild 
in 1992. There are now 162 
California condors, with 113 in 
captivity, 29 flying free in 
California and 20 more in 
Arizona near the Grand 
Canyon. 

DETROIT - General Motors 
and the United Automobile 
Workers (UAW) hope to reach a 
new, four-year labor contract 
within the next several days, as 
the relationship between the 
world's largest company and its 
main union appears to have 
improved considerably since last 
year's 54-day strike in Flint, 
Mich., auto industry and union 
officials said. 

Negotiators for the two sides 
worked through the weekend to 
mold an agreement similar to 
that concluded by the union 
with DaimlerChrysler AG on 
Sept. 16. DaimlerChrysler work-
ers voted. on that agreement on 
Saturday. While the vote count is 
not scheduled for release until 
Monday, local union officials 
predicted that the pact would be 
easily ratified. 

The UAW's previous, three-
year agreement with GM, 
OaimlerChrysler and Ford 

Motor Co. expired on Sept. 14, 
but the union has agreed to keep 
workers on the job while it nego-
tiates with each company. A GM 
official close to the talks said 
Sunday, "They're making 
progress, they met until very late 
last night." 

The UAW agreement with 
DaimlerChrysler and a new pact 
by the Canadian Auto Workers 
union with Ford both call for 
wage increases that exceed the 
inflation rate by nearly 3 per-
cent. The UAW contract also lim-
its how quickly DaimlerChrysler 
can snrinj{ its work force 
through attrition, a provision 
that might cause some difficul-
ties for GM. If GM accepts an 
identical provision, it could con-
tinue downsizing but with some 
limits on how quickly it does so. 

Labor relations between GM 
and the UAW have improved 
since last year's strike for sev-
eral reasons. GM appears to 

have suffered a small but per-
manent loss of market share 
because of the strike, making 
neither the company nor the 
union eager to repeat the expe-
rience. The American auto mar-
ket is booming, leaving every 
automaker straining to keep up 
with production and autowork-
ers reluctant to risk their profit-
sharing checks on another 
walkout. 

And GM has completely 
revamped its approach to labor 
negotiations since last year, 
bringing Gary Cowger, who had 
been running GM's German sub-
sidiary, back home and giving 
him unusually broad authority 
as group vice president for labor 
relations. Cowger has gotten 
along very well with UAW lead-
ers, said a union official.

. WASHINGTON The 
speaker of the House acknowl-

. edged Sunday that Congress 
and the White House will not

when the year begins, and said 
that Congress would pass a

Champagne Makers Promise Plenty to 
Cry into on New Year's Eve 

AY, France - Sir Wmston 
Churchill, who knew a thinK or 
two about fine living, usecI to 
say of his favorite champagne, 
"In victory I deserve it, and In 
defeat, I need it." This New 
Year's Eve, partygoers apparent-
ly have decided that when it 
comes to French champagne 
they, too, have to have it. 

Sales of French champagne 
have been setting records for 
months. The fact that the 
American ecmorny is booming, = with a taste for luxury 

, is one reuon. So is the 
notion of' . in the millenni-
um with ~ full of the real 
stuff. 

Wine merchants in the United 
SQ_ say French champagne is 
being rationed to them month by 
month. Advertisements from 
champagne makers are warning 
ptq'Je to prepare for their parties 
by laying in a supply early. Food 
and wine writers have been 
debating the poaibility of a short· 
age for more than a year. 

But here in the heart of the 
champagne-making region of 
France, talk of a shortage Is 
laughed off as nonsense. Why 

There'll be enough for 
everybody. All that 
saying 'Buy now or 
there won't be any-
more' does is stimu-
late even more sales. 

would any smart winemaker 
mismanage the millennium? 

"There are a few makers who 
don't have any champagne left," 
said Rene Goutorbe, who took a 
moment off from directing trac-
tors to his wine presaes as the 
1999 harvest arrives here. "But 
they're the same ones who didn't 
have any left last year at this time, 
and they won't have any next 
year, either:' 

Several years ago, the cham-
pagne houses and the growers of 
the three grapes essential for the 
genuine bubbly - pinot nolr, 
pinot chardonnay and pinot 
meunier - agreed to prOduce 
enough gripes to make an aver-
age of 270 million bottles of 
champagne a year for the rest of 
the 1990s, about SO million bot-

ties more than they had been 
selling in the recession years 
early in the decade. 

The producers also agreed to 
draw down the equivalent of 132 
million bottles of reserve wine, 
normally saved for yean with a 
poor harvest, and use it to put 
more champagne on the marbt 
in 1999 than ever before. 

The result is that there will be 
plenty of non-vintage wine to go 
around. Champagne sales this 
year will most likely far surpass 
300 million bottles and set a 
record, up to 15 percent more 
than last year's figures, accord-
ing to executives at Champagne 
Laurent-Perrier. 

"All our e~tiQlll have 
been surpassed, ' said Christian' 
Pol-Roger, whose Champagne 
Pol Roger company in EPemay 
is one of the few French houses 
in private hands. "There'll be 
enough for everybody. All that 
saying 'Buy now or there won't 
be anymore' does is stimulate 
even more sales."

think they ought to be able to get

With. a 70 percent turnout, 
UCSD graduate students voted 
281 to 215 in favor of union repre-
sentation last spring quarter. 
UCSD graduate students, like 
their colleagues at the seven other 
UC teaching campuses, will be 
represented by a United Auto

Elizabeth Bunn, UAW vice 
president, said the union will 
continue to serve its constituen-
cy. 

"These victories are a testa-
ment to the dedication of the 
membership during a long strug-
gle," Bunn said. "We will be 
building on that commitment in 
bargaining a first contract with 
UC administrators."

Record Amount of 
PrIY ... SUpport 

UCSD announced last month 
that private support for fiscal 
year 1998-1999 amounted to 
$116.3 million, an increase of 50 
percent over the prior fiscal year, 
and 179 percent over fiscal 1988-
1989. Private support refers to 
donations from non-public 
sources. 

Chancellor Robert Dynes said 
he was pleased with the record-
breaking support. . 

"This was the first year UCSD 
ever raised more than 5100 mil-
lion from private sources," Dynes 
said. "Last year's success in pri-
vate fund-raising efforts, com-
bined with our record-breaking 
$446 million in research awards, 
reflects the high-level of respect 
held for the activities underway 
atUCSD." 

In addition, UCSD received a 
record level of support for 
research last fiscal year, amount-
ing to more than $446 million, 
an 8.2 percent increase over the 
previous year. These awards, 
which include funds for 
research and clinical studies, 
rank first in the University of 
California system. 

The National Science 
Foundation (NSF) ranked UCSD 
fifth in the nation for research and 
development awards from (eder-
al agencies in 1996, the most 
recent year for NSF data.

PUBUC: 
UCSD students must 
fight for their beliefs 
Coall He.,.... ..... AlO 
even have to defend them. See 
my point? 

Public colleges, unlike their 
private counterpa~ts, do not shel-
ter students from the realities of 
daily life, however harsh they 
may be. Instead of the small, 
individualized classes available 
at most private schools, large 
public univenities offer imper-
sonal lectures to classes of hun-
dreds. Instead of being gently 
guided through our education, 
we must fight to be heard above 
three hundred other voices in 
Peterson Hall. Instead of having 
our beliefs affirmed daily by the 
administration, we must stand 
up against others to have them 
recognized. Private universities 
are a grade school with harder 
classes, while we in the public 
sector must fight the battles of 
the adult world. 

I have no idea if the quality of 
the education at private schools is 
superior to that at public schools. 
For the price, however, it certain-
ly should be. I also have no idea 
which provides the better "col-
lege experience." It most likely 
depends on a number of facton 
- most notably the individual 
receiving the education. 
Everyone has different prefer-
ences. 

I do know this, however: while 
private schools can provide a 
place to work on a degree, they 
do notrrepare students for life in 
genera . Life on a private campus 
may be more comfortable for four 
yean, but after 'that, people leam 
the hard way that reality bites. 
Fortunately for us, this fact will 
not catch us by surprise at the end 
~ur college careers. Thanks to 
the hanh realities of UCSD, we'll 
already know.

Continued froaI ...,. A1 
p.m. and every 12 minutes after 
9:30 p.m. until 12:20 a.m. 

In addition, UCSD has con-
tracted with San Diego Transit to 
provide free, unlimited bus 
transportation on . designated 
bus routes within a specified 
zone around campus. 

The zone extends to Pacific 
Beach, Mission Beach and 
Balboa Avenue at Genesee. 

Faculty, staff and students 
are eligible to receive the free 
bus sticker, which should be 
applied to UCSD photo identifi-
ca tion cards. Stickers are ava i1-
able at the Rideshare 
Operations Office. 

The two new parking struc-
tures have opening deadlines of 
next September. The Gilman 
Drive lot will have five-and-a-
half levels with approximately 
870 parking spaces. 

A six-level North Torrey 
Pines structure will have 970 
spaces. 

Architectural models of the 
two new parking structures are 
on display in the foyer of Geisel 
Library. 

In October of 1998, there 
were approximately 6,215 avail-
able student spaces. This year, 
there are approximately 6,624, 
according to Greg Snee, director 
of UCSD Parking and 
Transportation. 

This is an increase of less than 
one percent, while UCSD enroll-
ment increased almost three per-
cent this year.

housing and dining services,

to minimize noise for students

"Most construction projects 

start at 6:30 in the morning," 
Barrett said . "We have written 
into the contract that Facilities

enforce that no work can start

when no work can start before

In November of 2000, con-

"There will be a number of 
our undergraduates that volun-
teer time to work with these spe-
cially selected kids who are com-
ing to the Preuss School and 
work with them both as tutors 
and as mentors," Souviney said. 
"In addition, we have faculty on 
campus who are very interested 
in doing work in schools watch-
ing both teachers and children." 

UCSD currently has under-
graduates working as mentors 
and tutors in local schools 
around San Diego county. Like 
these schools, the Preuss School 
will not only benefit the tutee but 
the tutor, Souviney said. 

"Undergraduates who tutor 
or mentor for young children 
must thoroughly understand 
their own ideas and often learn 
new things about themselves and 
the world," Souviney said. 

According to Alvarez, the 
Preuss School is a chance for 
UCSD students to really see how 
they can play a part in helping 
others less fortunate or simply 
help kids in general. 

"This generation is much 
more caring about society," 
Alvarez said. "The Preuss School 
provides a really good opportu-
nity for that to come out in 
[UCSD) students." 

The Preuss School gives 
tutors, mentors, Preuss School 
teachers including UCSD profes-
sors, the opportunity to under-
stand how children learn. 

"It's really another research 
program where the university is 
interested in learning what can 
be done to change what's been 
going on for so ~ny yean, H said 
Alvarez. "There's a lot of out-
reach programs, but this really is 
a glass bubble that we can learn 
from." 

Until next year, the Preuss 
School will be housed at Marshall

college, using several portable 
classrooms and a portion of the 
college, including La Casa. 

Though only 150 sixth, sev-
enth and eight graders currently 
attend the Preuss School, a new 
$14 million complex is under 
construction on UCSD's East 
Campus and is expected to 
accommodate 700 sixth through 
12th graders by 2003. 
Administrators expect construc-
tion to be completed in August of 
next year. 

The school is organized into 
six classes, 25 students in each. 
There are 50 students in each 
grade. The school day, which 
begins at 8:45 a.m. and ends at 
4:15 p.m., is longer than most. 
The day is cut into four, 1:45 
minute classes. Currently, there 
are nine teachers teaching eight 
courses. Each day the set of four 
classes changes. 

The students who attend the 
Preuss School come from all over 
San Diego County and are bused 
to school. There are over 200 stu-
dents on the waiting list to get 
into the school. Five hundred 
and three students applied this 
year. 

The marriage between UCSD 
and the Preuss School will not 
only benefit undergraduates and 
faculty at UCSD, but the individ-
uals for whom it was created, the 
Preuss School students. 

The goal is to make low 
income students eligible to attend 
UCSD, or any other university of 
its caliber. 

"We are educating students 
who might Blip through the 
cracks because of socioeconomic 
status or non-performance 
schools," said Jan Gabay, the 
Preuss School's English teacher. 

UCSD realizes that a lot of 
kids, before they get to high ' 
school, have missed out because 
they either haven't taken the 
right courses or haven't received 
the riKitt preparation in middle 
schoof, Alvarez said. 

"Some of these kids might not 
make it if they stayed back in 
their neighborhood schools,"

UC BOARD OF REGENTS BRIEFS •• • UC Settles Case 
$27 Billion UC Budget Reduces Student Fees POUCY: ACLU sued Dynes for reprimanding student 

Gov. Gray Davis signed into 
law a budget that will give the 
University of California 52.7 bil-
lion, making the UC system 
more affordable for California 
residents. 

The budget, signed on June 
29, set aside 526.5 million to 
reduce the mandatory system-
wide fees paid by graduate and 
undergraduate students by 5 
percent. These reductions do not 
mclude miscellaneous fees spe-
cific to each campus. 

UC President Richard 
Atkinson said he was pleased 
with the fee cuts. 

"These fee red uctions will be 
welcomed by our students and 
their families," Atkinson stated. 
"We are also pleased that while 
fees are being reduced, the gov-
ernor and legislature have main-
tained the state's contribution to 
financial aid." 

The budget also funds the UC 
Board of Regents' basic budget 
request for 1999-2000. It pro-
vides funding for core needs 
including a 3.7 percent growth in 
enrollment from last year, com-
pensation for faculty and staff 
and cost increases for current 
programs. . 

Included in the budget is $17 
million in funding for new out-
reach programs and K-12 acade-
mic improvement initiatives. 

The budget also provides addi-
tional funding for the University 
of California for deferred mainte-
nance, instructional technology, 
instructional equipment and 
library collections. 

The UC Regents approved 
the budget in their July meeting.

University of California 
President Richard Atkinson 
named Carol Tomlinson-Keasey 
as the first chancellor of the yet-
to-be-built UC Merced campus 
at the UC Regents' July meeting. 

Tomlinson-Keasey, 56, cur-
rently serves in the University of 
California Office of the President 
as vice provost for academic ini-
tiatives. Atkinson put her in 
charge of the planning efforts for 
UC Merced last year. 

UC Regents Chairman John 
Davies said he was pleased with 
Atkinson's selection of 
Tomlinson-Keasey. 

"She already has proven her 
effectiveness in leading the 
new campus over the past 
year," Davies said. "She has a 
wonderful opportunity to help 
shape the academic traditions 
of a new University of 
California campus. The regents 
are impressed with her acade-
mic and scientific credentials 
and her enthusiasm for making 
UC Merced a premier campus 
of th~ University of 
California ." 

UC Merced is expected to 
open in 2005 with a combined 
enrollment of 1,000 undergradu-
ate and graduate students. The 
campus is expected to grow by 
about 800 full-time students 
each year. 

The regents approved an 
annual salary for Tomlinson-
Keasey of 5225,000. 

Like other UC chancellors, 
the university will provide her 

with a home, which will serve as 
a personal residence, a site for 
university-related events and as 
a place. to entertain distin-
guished campus visitors.

Officials at the University of 
California and the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory have taken 
disciplinary action against two 
laboratory employees and a lab-

nection with a national security 
investigation. 

The disciplinary action was 
taken at the request of Secretary 
of Energy Bill Richardson. The 
university manages the Los 
Alamos laboratory for the U.S. 
Oepartment of Energy. 

The diSCiplinary actions 
include, for the first individual, a 
formal letter of reprimand, a 
restricted job assignment for at 
least five years, a freeze in salary . 
and probationary-type measures. 

The second individual will be 
precluded from providing con-

for at least five years. 

The third individual will 
receive a letter from UC presi-

By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

In response to a lawsuit filed 
by the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) on behalf of 
Warren college sophomore Ryan 
Benjamin Shapiro, UCSD will 
revise its posting policy and clari-
fy its fighting words policy. 

Jordan Budd, managing attor-
ney of the ACLU in San Diego 
and Imperial Counties, filed the 
lawsuit in federal court after 
Shapiro was reprimanded for 
refusing to remove a sign stating 
"Fuck Netanyahu and Pinochet" 
from his residence hall window. 

The university and the ACLU 
settled the case on Aug. 11 . 
Shapiro said that the settlement 
agreed upon by the ACLU and 
the University of California 
includes everything that he peti-
tioned for in his lawsuit. 

''I'm thrilled," Shapiro said. "It 
was vindicating ... It was satisfy-
ing to see that the system works." 

The settlement states that a 
guide to interpreting and applying 
the fighting words policy must 
now be distributed with the poli-
cy, which is a part of the Student 
Conduct Code. The interpretation, 
issued by the University of 
California (UC)'s Office of the 
General Counsel, states that fight-
ing words are epithets "inherently 
likely to provoke an immediate 
violent reaction." 

The guide also states that before 
reprimanding a student for violat-
ing the fighting words policy, cam-
pus administrators should consult 
with the Office of General Counsel. 

The settlement also states that 
the existing posting policy will be 
replaced. Under the new policy,

UCSD may not restrict messages 
posted in residence hall win-
dows. The new posting policy 
also provides students with a 
clear understanding of what they 
can and cannot post in campus-
wide areas. 

In addition to a revision of the 
posting policy and a clarification 
of the fighting words policy, the 
settlement also states that the uni-
versity must destroy any records 
of Shapiro's punishment and 
revise and clarify informational 
pamphlets given to students 
explaining their rights in student 
misconduct cases. 

Budd said that the new infor-
mational pamphlets were part of 
the settlement because Shapiro 
received conflicting ihformation 
regarding his rights to appeal his 
case. 

Shapiro placed the sign in his 
window on Nov. 17 last year. He 
said that after he refused to take it 
down at the request of his resi-
dent advisor, the Warren college 
resident dean's office ordered 
him to perform three hours of 
community service. Shapiro said 
he appealed the decision and 
then turned to the ACLU after 
losing that appeal. 

Student Legal Services 
Director Nick Aguilar, who 
became involved in the case after 
Shapiro turned to the ACLU for 
help, said that he believed from 
the beginning that the fighting 
words policy was misapplied in 
Shapiro's case. 

"What was done with the fight-
ing words policy was to have the 
general counsel's office issue a 
clarification for UC administrators

HOUSING: 
Barrett said spaces 
should open soon 
Cull •• 1111".. ..... Ai 
al resident in four-person apart-
ments. 

Barrett said that students 
have until 4 p.m. on the first day 
of classes to move into their on-
campus housing. He said that 
historically 20 to 25 students 
lose their spaces every year 
because they do not move in on 
time. He said, however, that he 
expects that number to be lower 
this year. 

Barrett added that in the first 
two to three weeks of school, 
some students will decide that 
they do not want to live on cam-
pus, in which case he will let 
them out of their contracts. 

Students moving in last 
Saturday were positive about 
the experience. 

Jeanine O'Brien, a Revelle 
graduate helping her brother 
move into Muir college, said 
thar the move-in process was 
going smoothly. . 

"It's a good thing they have 
enough carts," she said. "This is 
a plus." 

At Warren college, students 
from the residential life office 
were on hand to direct traffic 
and help students move in. 

Leonie Heyworth, a Warren 

college resident advisor direct-
ing the traffic lined up outside 
the Warren college campus said 
that most drivers have been 
patient, even when the line of 
cars stretched from Warren col-
lege to the intersection of Voigt 
and Gilman Drives. 

Heyworth also said that 
while most of the incoming stu-
dents and their families were 
patient with the traffic, a few of 
the "non move-in people" 
appeared rude and frustrated. 

She added that one driver 
gave her the finger. 

Because of increased enroll-
ments at some of the colleges, 
many Roosevelt and Marshall 
students will be living at Revelle 
and Warren colleges. 

Barrett said that Roosevelt 
college has an extensive outreach 
program for the approximately 
140 Roosevelt students who will 
be living in Revelle housing. 

"In some regards, those stu-
dents have the best of both 
worlds," Barrett said. "If they 
like what Revelle is doing. they 
can go to Revelle programs. If 
they like what Roosevelt is 
doing. they can go to Roosevelt 
programs. Revelle will not con-
sider them second-class citizens." 

Barrett said that unlike last 
year, he has received very few 
complaints from students and 
parents about the housing situa-
tion. 

"This summer, believe it or 

Neal Matthews 

The UCSD Guardian 

not, was very quiet," Barrett 
said. "Some of that was due to 
the fact that in our housing 
brochure we were very explicit. 
We tried to take out anything 
that was subject to interpreta-
tion and made it very black and 
white. We made it less of a mar-
keting piece and more of a reali-
ty piece." 

"Also this year," Barrett con-
tinued, "we included [the hous-
ing contract) into the admit 
packet that admissions sent out. 
In the past we had always 
mailed it out separately and of 
course people said they never 
received it or they got it mis-
placed or something like that." 

Barrett said that the new poli-
cies have really helped his office 
avoid complaints from students 
and parents. 

"Compared to last year it was 
180 degrees, it was like day and 
~ht," Barrett said. "I think we 
did a better job of keeping peo-
ple informed, being up front 
with them from the very begin-
ning. Honesty is the best policy." 

Barrett said that because 
there will be no housing relief 
until 2002, (when 1,200 new 
spaces will open up) the incom-
ing freshmen of next year will 
receive a one-year guarantee 
instead of the standard two-year 
guarantee. The freshmen enter-
ing in 2001, however, will once 
again receive a two-year guaran-
tee.

PREUSS: TEP 
tutors will work 
with the students 
ContInued ".. ..... A14 
Alvarez said . 

In the last several years, UCSD 
administrators have looked for 
ways to increase the number of 
underrepresented students on 
campus. 

"There are a lot of underrepre-
sented students that don't get to 
UCSD or other major universi-
ties," Alvarez said. "The universi-
ty is saying 'we're going to pre-
pare these students, and we're 
going to show how we can do it 
at a major research university.'" 

According to Jan Gabay, the 
Preuss School English teacher, 
one of the greatest things about 
having the schoo! at UCSD is the 
ability to tap into the resources of 
the university. 

Students at the Preuss school 
have been working with 
researchers at the Supercomputer 
Center and with the Visuaf Arts 
department, Alvarez said. In the 

ACLU: Aguilar 
called settlement a 
'win-win'situation 

confirming what I already 
believed to be the case, that is, that 
fighting words are only applicable 
in face to face situations where the 
words that are used are common-
ly understood epithets that, when 
used in the context used, would 
likely result in a violent reaction," 
Aguilar said. 

Aguilar added that he felt 
both parties involved in the law-
suit emerged as winners. 

"I think this was a win-win sit-
uation where [Shapiro) was vin-
dicated in terms of his belief that 
he was exercising his rights of 
expression consistent with the 
first amendment," Aguilar said.

future, Preuss School students 
will work with researchers at the 
School of Medicine and the dance 
and music departments. 

Currently, there are three 
tutors working at the Preuss 
School, but th,ey are looking for 
many more, said Jan Gabay, the 
Preuss School's English teacher. 

"Having a tutor is great help. 
It helps give us some more 
chances for individualized teach-
ing." Gabay said. 

Souviney said he would like 
to see 50 tutors working with the 
Preuss School and that there will 
be both paid and volunteer 
opportunities. 

"We're going to be very careful 
initially not to overwhelm the 
schoo\''' Souviney said. "Because 
of its proximity, it's very easy for 
us to be there. The Preuss School 
is also going to be very careful 
about what kind of research activ-
ities its going to participate in." 

Any students wishing to join 
the TEP program should call 534-
2957. While tutors are encour-
aged to take TEP courses, they 
are not mandatory, Souviney 
said. 

"And on the other hand, the uni-
versity was able to demonstrate 
its desire to encourage free 
speech, but in the context of a 
positive campus environment." 

Aguilar also said that he tried 
to avoid the lawsuit by agreeing to 
postpone Shapiro's punishment 
while the issue was resolved. 

Budd, however, said that he 
was never contacted by Aguilar 
until after the suit was filed on 
March 11. 

Shapiro said that the ACLU 
filed the suit only after they 
hand-delivered letters to Dynes 
and Warren college Provost 
David Jordan. He said the ACLU 
filed the suit on the eve of his 
deadline to perform the commu-
nity service. 

"I love UC5D," Shapiro said. 
"It's a good school but unfortu-
nately I had exhausted the 
appeals process."

Jacobs Addresses Grads Mayoral Race Begins 
CEREMONY: Langley calls attendance 'disappointing' ELECTION: Candidates condemn incumbents and city problems 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

UCSD held its third - and possibly 
last - all-campus commencement in June 
with Qua\comm founder and CEO Irwin 
Jacobs serving as guest speaker. The 1999 
all-campus commencement was held on 
Saturday, June 12 and preceded eight 
commencements at UCSD's individual 
colleges and graduate schools over the 
weekend of June 12 and 13. 

Vice Chancellor of Development and 
University Relations Jim Langley said that 
while only 700 to 750 students participat-
ed in the all-campus commencement, a 
combined total of over 3,000 students par-
ticipated in the individual college com-
mencements. He said he found the 
turnout at the all-campus commencement 
"disappointing." 

Langley also said he and Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs David 
Miller, co-chairs of the commencement 
committee, will deliver to Chancellor 
Robert Dynes a recommendation on 
whether or not the ceremony should con-
tinue. The recommendation will be deliv-
ered within two weeks. 

"I think what we have to do is look at 
those talli~ and the cost of an all-campus 
commencement and ask if the interest is 
high enough to warrant the cost," Langley 
said last week.

. \ . 

He added that future all-campus com-
mencements may depend upon the avail-
ability of a speaker of national promi-
nence, since President Bill Clinton and for-
mer House Speaker Newt Gingrich both 
drew larger crowds when they spoke at 
the 1997 and 1998 commencements, 
respectively. 

The ceremony, which was canceled last 
spring for lack of a speaker, was later rein-
stated by Dynes after students and par-
ents spoke out in its favor. 

The 1999 commencement began in the 
morning with an opening speech by the 
chancellor. 

Dynes introduced Jacobs by saying 
that the past two all-campus commence-
ments featured "fairly prominent speak-
ers." 

"This year," Dynes continued, "we are 
continuing that tradition and are doubly 
lucky to have Irwin Jacobs, who has not 
only accomplished a great deal but can 
also speak from the heart about UCSD." 

Jacobs served as a professor of comput-
er science and engineering at UCSD from 

. 1966 to 1972. 
UC Regent John Davies, speaking on 

behalf of the regents, began his speech 
with a joke about the numerous checks 
that students make payable to the "UC 
Regents."

With the primary election still five 
months away, eight out of the nine 
declared candidates for San Diego mayor 
met last Friday night at a community 
forum in Hillcrest sponsored by the San 
Diego Action Network and San Diego 
Citizen's Action. 

The candidates discussed current prob-
lems facing San Diego such as traffic and 
the lack of affordable housing. They also 
spent time criticizing the current adminis-
tration for its handling of various issues. 

The evening began with each candi-
date giving a five-minute opening speech. 
Afterward, questions were taken in writ-
ing from the audience and asked of the 
candidates. Each candidate had one 
rninute to respond to each question asked. 

Jim Bell, an author, consultant, and 
host of a weekly talk show on KFMB 
radio, was the first candidate to speak. He 
criticized the fact that San Diegans send 
$10 billion per year out of the region to 
import energy, food and water, leaving 
San Diego vulnerable and draining cash 
from the region. He said that, if elected, he 
will make San Diego more self-sufficient 
and will respect San Diego's delicate envi-
ronment in doing so.

(CCOC), condemned San Diego's "dis-
graceful" library system, polluted beach-
es, clogged freeways, lack of affordable 
housing and sewer problems. He. said that 
by running the city office like an efficient 
business, he could solve the city's prob-
lems and possibly give San Diegans a tax 
cut. He said that he has already demon-
strated his city leadership by redevelop-
ing parts of the city during his time with 
theCCDC. 

Janice Jordan, community activist and 
Southern California chair of the Peace and 
Freedom Party, condemned Davis' idea 
that the city should be run like a business. 
She said that because citizens should be 
treated equally, they should not be subject 
to the hierarchy and discrimination ass0-
ciated with a business. 

Jordan added that she believes in com-
munity policing. She commended the city 
grand jury for bringing to light unan-
swered questions relating to the new ball-
park such as its environmental impact and 
its real cost to taxpayers. 

She said that she was also concerned 
about the lack of public transportation in 
the city and cost of housing that she said 
has increased 29 percent in the past two 
years.

former city councilman, introduced him-

ricuIa," said literature PJOfeIeor 
Quincy Troupe. "She fought very 
hard against elitism and 
obscurism. She fought v~ hard 
for an American and internation-
al approach to the department 
She fought very hard aJlins_t a lot 
of odds to make this ~t 
a very exciting place to be for 
both faculty anClstudents and she 
was very, very passionate about 
that." 

Wtlilams was an uncompro-
mising teacher who encoUU!i 
stUdents to perfect their wri . 
UCSD graduate Nicole Ma e 
Martin. a former student, said 
that Williams left an indelible 
impression on her. 

"Her feedback on my writing 
was critical, but it meant 10 much 
coming from her. And when she 
liked the stories I wrote, I can't 
tell you what a thrill it wu," 
Martin stated. "She was so gen-
uine but aIsooinsifhtful when she 
spoke about stories, never mak-
ing life out to be more than that. 
'ust life." 
I Williams' moet SUCCft8ful 
novel, DaSII Rose, imagines a 
friendIbip between two women 
deKribed by MarxiIt historian 
Herbert A.,theker in A.mc:n 
NfgJ'O Slnt RnoIIs - a prepant 
Atnc.n American woman ..,. 
tented to death tor heIJrinI ..... a 
llave revolt and a whlte Waman 
living on an i_ted farm 
rumOIed to provide aanctuary for 
runaway slaves. 

In an interview at the time of 
at.. RDW. publication, 
WUIiamI explained !t'J she felt 
compeDed to emlte fiction out of 
two hisaical incidents. 

'"Part of the reuonl'm off into 
ftc:tkln is that I deeply beUeve irs 
a means of ~ the 
imJXll8ible," WilUamssaid. And 
putting these women together, I 
could come to understand lOme-
thing not only about their experi-
ence of slavery but about them as 
women and imagine the basis for 
some kind of honest rapproche-
ment between .black and white 
women." 

Like literary critics around the 
country, The New Yorl TImes book 
reviewer Christopher Lehmann-
Hauft praised DtSSII RIM when it 
was first published. . 

HThus has Sherley Anne 
Williams breathed wonderful life 
into the bare bones of the past," 
he wrote. "And thus does she 
resolve more issues than are 
dreamed of in most history text-
books." . 

Dijkstra said that DtsslI Rose 
was an extraordinary achieve-
ment. Williams was working on a 
sequel to the novel at the time of 
her death. 

"Dtssa Rose was really a land-
mark book and the testimony to 
that is that I sold it about 15 years 
ago and it has been earning roy-
alties ever since because of the 
fact that it is assigned in every 
African American studies course, 
and beyond that in American cul-
ture courses, n Dijkstra said. "1 
think it's because Sherley Anne 
was trying to get at the origins of 
racism and to see beyond them.

But, Me was able to do 10 with a poer. eye and a poet's voice. " 
Williams fint won acclaim u 

a poet. Her first book of poetry, 
TIlt PtIICDdc Poems was nominated 
for a Pulitzer Prize and National 
Book Award. She later won an 
Eauny Award for a televised 
reading of poemI from her sec-
ond poetry book. Same One Sw«t 

An~l ChiTt. 
In addition. Williams wrote 

the children'. boob Working 
Cotton and Gi'" ~t1tn. 

Working Cotton iI based on 
two verses from TIlt Peacock 
Poms and tells the story of a 
child laborer picking cotton with 
her family in California fields. 

Literature Professor Carlos 
Blanco-Ap~ga ~d that 
Wdliams' backgrOUnd u a field 
worker influenced the way she 
saw the world. 

"She alwaY' had not only a 
strong African American con-
sciousnesa, but a1Io aatrong class 
consciousness," BTanco-
Aguinar said. "(Her back-
ground also made her v.ery 
undentanding toward Chicanos. 
She knew how much thinp COIIt 
in terms of effort and suffering." 

In addition to being an accom-
plished writer, Williams wu aIao 
a skilled literary attic. 

"(She wu) a really, really 
lharp critic of American writing 
with incredible inIighII into the 
American literary tcene," Troupe 
said. "Very sharp and ~ro­
mising. She had clefiniteoplniON 
about where American literature 
had been and where it should 
go." 

In May 1998, WiIlianw wu 
guest of honor at a UCSD c0nfer-
ence celebrating "8Iadt Women 
Writen and die 'Hip Art' of 
Afro-American Letters." At the 
event, San Diego Mayor Swan 
Golding officially proclaimed 
May, IS, 1998, to be "Sherley 
Anne Williams Day." 

The conference. organized by 
former UCSD literature ProfeIeor 
Ann duCiIle who now teaches at 
Wesleyan University, commemo-
rated the 12th anniversary of 
DtsSII Rose's publication 

"When I first came to UCSD 
and was teaching DtsSII ReM, 
many of my students were read-
ing the novel for the first time, H 
duCille said in her introductory 
remarks at the conterence. "It 
occurred to me that we often 
don't know the giants who walk 
among us." 

At the 1998 conference, 
Gaffney organized a dramatic 
reading by professional actors of 
dialogue from f)tSSQ Rose. At the 
end of the performance, Williams 
stood up and told the actors, 
"Thank you for giving me my 
book back.H 

Gaffney said that aU but one of 
the actors who performed for the 
1998 conference will participate 
in a restaging of the reading at 
Williams' upcoming memorial 
service. The service is scheduled 
for Oct. 21 from 4 p.m. to 5:30 
p.m. in the Price Center Theater. 

Williams is survived by her 
son, Malcolm, three grandchil-
dren, a sister and three nieces. In 
lieu of flowers, her family asks 
that donations be made to the 
Jamilia Ramsay Scholarship 
Fund, Christian Fellowship 
Church, 1601 Kelton Rd., San

c ................ u 

As provost of Revelle college 
from 1967 to 1972 and vice chan-
cellor of academic affairs from 
1972 10 1980, Saltman played a 
role in shaping UCSD into the 
university that it is today. 

"He was one of the giants of 
the place," Scheffler said. "He 
shaped the culture of the univer-
sitv, the undergrads, the facul-
ty:f.' 

Bond also said he feels the 
impact that Saltman has had on ' 
UCSD. . 

"I;fe is the one who got the col-
lege.YIIem to work," Bond said. 
"In ~he ' mid-70s, he defended 
UCSD when }he Office of the 
President was only interested in 
protecting UCLA and UC

the end of their college careers

violence, hornelessness, illiteracy 
and hate crimes. Leventhal said 
that graduates should be ready to 
helf solve these problems. 

As college graduates, we are 
in a position to bring our knowl-
edge to the table," Leventhal 
said. "The time is now, the time 
has come." 

Jacobs then spoke, reflecting 
on his life and stressing the 
importance of change. 

Berkeley. Saltman was so single-
mindedly pro-UCSD that he hurt 
his own career." 

Overall, students and faculty 
alike remember Saltman as a man 
of great energy. . 

"He was in his 70s and still 
skiing," Farnaes said. "His ener-
gy is so important to remember; 
the love, caring and concern he 
had for others is amazing." 

Bond said that Saltman was so 
respected in part due to his sin-
cerity. • 

"He always said what he 
meant and meant what he said, H 
Bond said. "Saltman used very 
plain and challenging language 
and he wasn't afraid to use four-
letter words. H

"fust having the possibility of 
change allows us to apply our 
education aod come up with a 
new set of possibilities," Jacobs 
said. 

Jacobs also said that as a high 
school student in 1950, his guid-
ance counselor told him that 
there was no future in the science 
and engineering fields and that 
he should follow his parents into 
the restaurant business. 

Jacobs since founded the com-
pany Qualcomm and has con-
tributed to the development of 
wireless technology, including 
cellular phones. 

"By the way," he said, Hif a cell 
phone rings today, I'm probably

ority that Saltman kept through-
out his entire career. 

HWe have honored him by cre-
ating an Endowed Chair in 
Science Education with his name 
on it, and it pleased him very 
much that this came 10 pass and 
that he could be involved in set-
ting it up," Brody said. "The pas-
sion that he had for this type of 
education will be continued,-even 
if he is no~ able to actually be 
there to do It himself: . 

Faculty and students have 
said that they will miss Saltman's 
presence very much. 

"This campus will not be the 
same without him," Brody said. 
" A real light has gone out, and it 
is hard for many of us to go by his 
office and see the dosed door. We 
keep expecting to hear the boom-
ing voice and the wann and gra-
cious welcome from inside." 

Saltman is survived by his 
wife of 50 years, Barbara, their 
two sons, and five grandchildren.

He said that current problems 
facing the city include traffic con· 
gestion. poor maintenance of city 
facilities and the lack of a large 
airport. 

George Stevens, an associate

Brian E. C. SchoHlaender, 
associate university librarian for 
collections and technical services 
at UCLA, has been a!,pointed 
university librarian at UCSD. 

The announcement was made 
in July by Marcia Chandler, 
senior vice chancellor of academ-
ic affairs. 

Schottlaender was UCLA's 
associate university librarian for 
collections and technical aer-
vices from 1993 to 1999 with 
administrative responsibility for 
five departments, a branch 
library and three program areas 
with operating budgets totaling 
$5 million. 

He has administered a collec-
tions budget surpassing $9 mil-
lion and has coordinated the 
UCLA library's government-
funded grants initiatives. 

He joined UCLA's library sys-
tem in 1984 after working in the 
libraries of the University of 

way at Lindbergh Field and a 
traffic management system 
where the center divider on city 
freeways could be shifted to 
allow more lanes of traffic to flow 
during rush hour. 

Barbara Warden, a city coun-
cilwoman and founder of the 
Rill1ciro Benrardo News, said that in 
her tenure on the city council, she 
has seen the opening of three new 
libraries and three new recreation 
ce-nters in her district. She added 
that there are also plans to build a 
child care facility and a home for 
battered women in her district. 

Warden said that at a time 
when people thought freeway 
solutions were impossible, she 
helped secure $300 million dol-
lars for Interstate 15 and State 
Route 56, which will soon con-
nect Interstates 5 and 15. She also 
promised her constituents that 
the Miramar Marine Air Corps 
Station will never be converted 
into a civilian airport. 

Ron Roberts, former city coun-
cilman and current member of 
the County Board of Supervisors, 
arrived after the other candidates 
had spoken, blaming city traffic 
for his late arrival. He praised the 
construction of the uptown dis-

tion from loca residents. He said 
that the blending to retail shops 
and apartment buildings in the 
area should serve as a model for 
other parts of San Diego. 

Like Stevens, Roberts criti-
cized the city's deal to buy 
Chargers tickets, saying that the 
city could have built a library 
with the money that it "threw 
away" by buying Charger tickets. 

Loch David Crane, a former 
college professor, author and 
magidan, registered for the may-
oral race after the forum was 
organized. As a result, he was 
only allowed to speak for two 
minutes and not allowed to 
answer any questions. 

When asked about improving 
the quality of life for San Diegans, 
candidates said that their priori-
ties included creating a sustain-
able economy, affordable hous-
ing. a sheller for the homeless 
and solutions to the growing traf-
fic problem. 

City Councilman Byron Wear 
was the only mayoral candidate 
not in attendance because he had 
a prior engagement.

EXPANSION: 
Entertainment should 
only exist out West 
ContInued from ..... A36 
coliseum deal, another pushing 
for a stadium in Hollywood Park, 
and a third for a new adobe, 
Spanish-style edifice in Carson. 

If the NFL ultimately decides 
to award the expansion team to 
Houston and not to L.A., the most 
reasonable solution to this ongo-
ing fiasco would be to place the 
incompetent Raiders in Carson. 
That way, Al Davis would have 
the oPfortunity to get out of the 
city 0 Oakland - where he's 
involved in a lawsuit - and 
return to L.A. 

In addition, if the team moved 
to Carson, the Raiders would 
play their games on the outskirts

Anywhere you dare. 

of the city where most football 
fans in L.A. would agree they 
belong. 

If Davis gains property rights 
to the site of the new stadium, 
maybe he could also set up a few 
oil drills; there's quite an abun-
dance of fossil fuels out in the city 
of Carson. He could supplement 
his lost revenue from the empty 
seats with capital from drilling 
for fossil fuels . Also, Davis could 
thoroughly irritate the people of 
Oakland, a pastime that Davis 
enjoys a great deal. 

The point of my dispute is not 
that league owners should move 
their teams to potentially lucra-
tive mines and wells in order to 
help their struggling franchises . It 
is that Houston deserves the new 
team by a longshot over Los 
Angeles. They have more fan 
interest than L.A. - not to men-
tion oil - and city council sup-

While L.A. Mayor Richard 

Riordan and other financially 
well-off citizens of Los Angeles 
chew the fat over their cell 
phones on the way to weekend 
shows at the Hollywood Bowl, 
devoted football fans in Houston 
would sell-out stadiums and be 
louder than the less rowdy aris-
tocracy. Just get a damn hot dog, 
tear off your clothes, paint your 
body with your home team's col-
ors and shout your larynx out 
when your team scores touch-
downs! 

Houston fans may not be as 
barbaric as the Dog Pound in 
Cleveland or the frozen middle-

Buffalo's Rich Stadium during

Sundays. But the problem is that 
they'd be devoted to their 
favorite bands and not some foot-
ball team representing the 32nd 
franchise of the NFL. 

No Football in Los Angeles. 
The bottom line is that the City 

of Angels is too laid back and the 
fan base too dispersed to accom-
modate a football team. 
Entertainment captivates people 
there and not a new sports fran-
chise. They say money can't buy 
you love and it applies in this sit-
uation. No one's saying that there 
isn't enough dough present in 
Los Angeles to sustain a team, but 
just that there isn't enough adora-
tion to ensure its meaning for 
L.A. and the league. 

So Commissioner Tagliabue, 
please give the Houston fans 
what they want and deserve and 
see about lowering the price of a 
movie ticket for Angelinos.

POLO: 
Tritons perform well 
against the ~lite 

"We wanted to make a state-
ment in this match because 
Loyola has five full rides now and 
is making a Division I-type 
effort," said Harper of the final 
match. His players did make a 
statement as they destroyed 
Loyola Marymount 13-3 to win 
the tournament in an impressive 
fashion. 

After the tournament win, the 

Tritons traveled to LA to take on 
the University of Southern 
California (USC), then the top 
team in the nation and currently 
ranked second. The Tritons put 
forth a monumental effort and 
gave the Trojans all they wanted, 
but in the end USC escaped with 
an 8-6 victory. The Tritons were 
down by only 1 point late in the 
fourth quarter and had a chance 
to tie but were unable to convert. 

"They think of us as a thorn in 
their side," Harper said of the 
Division I schools. "1 think it 
annoys them that a little Division 
III school like us can compete 
with them year in and year out." 

The UCSD Guardian 

After the loss to USC, the 
Tritons moved on to the Southern 
California tournament in L.A. 
and competed against all the top 

. tearns in the nation. Here the 
team amassed a 2-2 record with 
victories over conference rivals 
UC Davis and Air Force, plus an 
impressive two-goal loss to top-
ranked, and eventual champion, 
Stanford University. 

With its record now at 6-3, 
UCSD took on Loyola 
Marymount fo~ a second time. 
Playing without five starters, all 
of whom were suspended by 
Harper, the Tritons gave every-
thing they had and scratched out 

a one-goal victory. The Tritons 
were led by returning team cap-
tain and conference MVP Ross 
Mecham. 

"In crunch time we look to 
him," said Hare;r of his two-
meter defender. Ross is definite-
ly the leader of this team." 

Next up for the Tritons is a 
five-game tournament called the 
UC Santa Cruz Slugfest, from 
Oct. 1-3. The Tritons wiD again be 
missing five starters and four 
reserves for these matches but 
have already proved with their 
victory over Loyola Marymount 
that they can always take on the 
conference's best.

A34 SPORTS 

PICKS: 
Florida State will 
win the Sugar Bowl 
ContInued fr ......... AM 
see it. 

After a rather lackluster sea-
son a year ago, the Florida 
Gators seem to have rebounded 
this season . Steve Spurrier 
always !,uts a potent offense on 
the field , but his defensive 
teams can sometimes be a bit 
suspect. This defense passed an 
early season test when it held 
the Tennessee Volunteers to 
three touchdowns in a 23-21 
victory two Saturdays ago. This 
victory over the then second-
ranked Volunteers catapulted 
Florida to third in the AP polls 
and made it a legitimate con-
tender to win a birth in the 
Sugar Bowl. 

As bright as Florida's future 
looks, and as impressive as its 
win against Tennessee was, the 
team has two problems looming 
that could keep it out of the big 
game. The first problem is the 
fact that it plays in the 
Southeastern Conference (SEC). 
The SEC is annually considered 
either the first or second most 
difficult college footbaU confer-
ence in the nation, and Florida 
has all the big SEC teams on its 
schedule again this season. 

Although Tennessee was 
probably Florida's toughest SEC 
opponent this year, there are still 
at least two more SEC games 
that Florida could potentially 
lose. Florida will almost 
undoubtedly end the regular 
season in the SEC championship 
game, which will be another 
tough test, regardless of the 
opponent. 

Despite the tough competi-
tion, however, I believe that 
Florida will make it through the 

SEC season unscathed . 
The second problem Florida 

faces is a late-season match-up 
with Florida State. The 
Seminoles were last year's 
national runners-up and 
returned almost everybody to 
this year 's squad. Led by 28-
year-old quarterback Chris 
Weinke and Heisman favorite 
wide receiver Peter Warrick, the 
Seminoles have a better offen-
s ive team then some NFL 
squads. Bobby Bowden show-
cased his potent attack in a 42-10 
pounding of then 20th-ranked 
North Carolina State. 

The Seminoles have looked 
all but unbeatable early on this 
season and should end the 
Gators' chances of playing in 
New Orleans on jan. 4, when the 
two teams play in the 'Seminoles' 
regular season finale. 

Believe it or not, there are 
actually contenders outside the 
state of Florida. Penn State has 
shown that it is a defensive force 
this season and hung on two 
weekends ago to defeat a very 
good Miami Hurricane team. 
Led by consensus All-American 
linebacker La Var Arrington, 
Penn State has lived up to its 
hype as the best defensive team 
in the country. 

Yet, a tough 'Big Ten schedule 
could spell doom for the Nittany 
Lions simply because of the 
quality opponents they will face 
week in and week out - but no 
team in that conference has 
enough weapons to defeat a 
Penn State team that is playing 
like it should. With Ohio State 
having somewhat of an off year 
and Michigan having a hard 
time scoring, the Nitfany Lions 
will certainly be favored in all of 
their games from here on out. 

joe Paterno's squad showed 
that it is not impervious to let-
down games three weeks ago 
when it needed a blocked field 

The UCSD Guardian 

goal by Arrington to defeat 
lowly Pittsburg. Another lack-
luster performance like that in 
Big-Ten play could end the 
Nittany Lions' National 
Championship hopes . Even 
lowly Big Ten opponents like 
1l1inois and Michigan State have 
far superior talent to Pittsburg 
and could possibly be a chal-
lenge. 

As far as I am concerned, the 
dark horse in this race is 
Virginia Tech. So far this year, 
the eighth-ranked Hokies have 
been impressive; a 31-11 victory 
over Clemson two weeks ago 
legitimized them as a real threat. 
Virginia Tech will be aided by a 
very soft Big East schedule and 
won't face tough non-confer-
ence games. 

The toughest game for the 
Hokies will be a Nov. 13 match-
up against Miami. Luckily, they 
have the Hurricanes at home 
this year. The Hokies 
must go undefeated and hope 
that there is no more than one 
other undefeated team in the 
nation if they want any chance 
at a Sugar Bowl birth. 

With all this speculation, the 
only thing left to do is watch the 
games and see how this season 
plays out. Every week, things 
will come more into focus. My 
prediction is that Florida State 
will be the only team left unde-
feated when December rolls 
around and will therefore get 
one spot in the Big Game on jan. 
4. Its opponent will be decided 
by the BCS formula that Einstein 
himself wouldn't have been able 
to understand - so your guess 
is as good as mine. 

I would put my money on 
Florida State to defeat whomev-
er it plays, but this is coming 
from the guy who told you to bet 
the farnl on Ohio State last year. 
I guess that's why they play the 
games.

key in victories 
eon ......... ,.... .... ue 

On Sept. 17, the University of 
La Verne presented a slightly 
more difficult obstacle for the 
UCSD volleyball team to sur-
mount. Nonetheless, the Tritons 
still punished them to defeat in 
three straight games 15-11, 15-7, 
15-9. 

Hentz led the attack by going 
11 for 20 for a .550 day. Although 
the team percentage was not as 
outstanding as the previous 
match, UCSD hung tough with 54 
digs on the defensive end of the 
court - 12 more than La Verne. 

MOMENTUM: 
Timely goals bolster 
tritons' record

47:15 mark to tie the game. 

With its first home match of 
the season, UCSD got on the win-
ning side to even the record. One 
goal in the first half, by 
Aleksandar Glebov against 
University of Redlands, was all 
that was needed for the 1-0 win. 

The Tritons continued their 
winning ways with a dominating 
3-0 victory at Claremont College, 
their biggest win of the early sea-
son. Bernard was on fire, scoring 
two of his team's 3 goals. 
Teammate Glebov tacked one on 
early in the match. 

Tuesday. September 28. 1999 

The only viable threat to the 
Tritons' winning streak came in 
the first g"me, when La Verne ran 
the score up tQ 11 . UCSD, howev-
er, stuffed its attack in the next 
two games for the victory. 

The Tritons ran their win 
streak to 11 matches after going 4-
o at the Cal State Hayward 
Invitational to win the event 
handily. 

After the match, McFarland 
praised his team. "Leslie Punelli 
had a great tournament and was 
our most steady player," 
McFarland said, "but the story of 
our season so far is how so many 
people have been able to con-
tribute." 

The Triton's next match is on 
Saturday against the University 
of La Verne. 

The team's second home game 
of the season was disappointing 
as it could not overcome a 2-0 
first-half deficit against Biola 
University, losing 2-1. 

The fritons continued this 
downward skid against 
Vanguard University. Vanguard 
jumped out to a big 2-0 first-half 
lead with two goals by Diego 
Goni. 

UCSD's defense regrouped 
and held tough for the rest of the 
match. Adams connected on a 
penalty kick at the 57:~ mark to 
cut the lead in half, but the come-
back ended there. 

Coming off their victory 
against Christian Heritage, the 
Tritons enjoy their third straight 
home game when they host 
Chapman University on Friday at 
7p.m .

Reliable Defense Carries 
Women'. Soccer Team' ao......... Jennifer Hetland and her fullbacks 
stifle opponents and earn four shutouts 
By IRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

Back to school: Depending on 
your point of view that might be a 
painful statement. For some of us, 
though, it's not. EspeciaUy if you 
have been w~U briefed about what 
has transpired during the UCSD 
women's soccer team's season 
thus far. 

Beginning in late August, 
while you and I were away from 
school and in denial about the 
fact that we would be inhabiting 
the lecture halls in a month, our 
women's soccer team had its first 
scrimmage. 

The field is lit up with talent, 
the fans are back for the fall to 
cheer their team on and the atti-
tude is a winning one for the No. 
9 ranked (Division III) UCSD 
women's soccer team. 

In a recent game against the 
University of Puget Sound in 
Washington, the Triton's opposi-
tion stayed with them for about 
the first 45 minutes. But the 
Tritons saved their best for later 
in the contest by scoring three 
second-half goals to cruise to the 
3-0 victory. 

The Loggers (2-2) appeared 
solid in the first half as both 
teams made the game a scoreless 
stand-off by playing cautiously. 
The Tritons emerged from half-
time pumped up and quickly got 
things moving in their direction 
when Cindy Dostalek took a 
rebound off Logger goalkeeper 
Karen Ecklebe and hit the back of 
the net. Emma Borst was credited 

with the assist on the play and 
then at 56:40 Borst got on the 
board herself as she took the cross 
from Dostalek and headed in the 
second goal of the game. UCSD 
added its final goal late - 82:01 
- on an Elizabeth Hughes shot 
and a jessica Cordova assist. 
jennifer Hetland earned the 
shutout for UCSD and had one 
save on the day. 

UCSD's 3-0 shutout victory 
follows three previous shutouts 
of opponents at the hands of the 
Tritons this year. With the potent 
defensive duo of Jennifer Hetland 
and Laura Dolkas as goalkeepers 
and a hearty batch of players 
backing them up, the women's 
soccer team has blanked 
Claremont College 8-0, Pomona 
Pitzer 4-0 and Cal State San 
Bernadino 3-0. In the Sept. 12 
blowout against Claremont 
played at UCSD, five of the 10 
starters for the Tritons scored 
goals with Lauren Jacobs scoring 
twice and Lizzy Schilling booting 
in two out of three shots attempt-
ed. 

Two days earlier versus 
Pomona-Pitzer College, UCSD 
saw two of their four goals made 
by substitutes Heidi Bork and 
Melanie Gephart. In a 4-0 victory, 
Pomona-Pitzer was lucky they 
didn't suffer a slaughtering 
defeat at the hands of UCSD, for 
goalkeeper Zelinda Welch record-
ed 10 saves and spared her team a 
bad defeat. 

Next up for the Tritons is a 
match against Chapman 
University on Friday at 7 p.m ..

Cross CountIy Debuts Strongly 
DedIcation: Tough environment is no match for Triton runners 
By ROIERT AlLTON 
Staff Writer 

Coming into this fall, the 
UCSD cross country team 
hopes to build on the success of 
last year. Last season the 
women's team finished fourth 
in Division III while the men 
placed third .and enjoyed con-
tinuing success by finishing 
first at the Western Regionals. 

With the season starting off 
promising for both the mens' 
and womens' teams, continued 
success and improvement 
seems well within their grasp. 

The Tritons' 1999 fall season 
started off with a fair showing at 
the CSUF jammin' Cross 
Country Invitational at Carbon 
Canyon Park on Saturday Sept. 
4. The competition in this meet is 
some of the best the Tritons will 
see. The women finished sev-
enth out of 16 teams with a score 
of 177 and an average time of 
19:44.78 in the 5,000 meters. The 
winning team was UCLA with 
18 points. 

The Tritons were led by 
Sarah Leonard who clocked a 
19:02.30 for 19th place. The men 
finished slightly ahead at fifth 
place with a score of 119, being 
led by james Nielsen who took 
first with a 25:]6.30 in the 8,000 
meters. 

"Nielsen is considered to be 
one of the best in the nation," 
said Head Coach Ted Van 
Arsdale. "He's a very strong 
character. He's a bull." 

Both the men's and the 
women's cross country teams 
got on the ' winning side with 
dominating victories at home 
against Point Loma Nazarene on 

Thursday, Sept. 9. The men 
downed Point Loma Nazarene 
15-SO while the women were vic-
torious 17-41. The men took the 
top five places, led by David 
Dunbar who finished first with a 
time of 21:23.71. The women 
took the top three places, led by 
Leonard, who took first with a 
time of 15:25.76. 

Last Saturday, the Tritons 
seemed to be getting into prime 
form. The women took first at the 
Riverside Cross Country 
Invitational with a score of 40. 
Not to be outdone, the men also 
took first with a score of 60. 
Carolyn jones led the lady Tritons 
with a time of 18:41 .60 while 
Dunbar was the highest men's 
finisher at fifth with a 21 :50.00. 

"The course was brutal. It 
was very hilly. It was up or 
down, nothing flat . The finish 
was uphill," Van Arsdale said. 

"Carolyn kept her compo-
sure and focused on her race and 
then won," Van Arsdale contin-
ued. "That attitude sucked two 
of our girls up. That was team 
camaraderie." 

Leadership is crucial to help-
ing a team grow and mature. 
Van Arsdale also said that last 
year's returning runners were an 
important part of the teams' 
successes. 

"Both teams are fiUed with 
runners from last year," said Van 
Arsdale. "On the women's side 
we have some incoming fresh-
men pushing the 'A' team. We 
have a lot of first year women 
that have had a tremendous 
impact." 

The men's side that took first 
in the region looks only to get 
better. 

"Most of the men we call stal-
lions, but we have S9me colts 
that are coming on," said Van 
Arsdale. "Allen Shapiro is com-
ing along nicely. The athlete has 
to work [his or her] way onto the 
, A' team. He's done a terrific 
job." 

Sports in general often 
require a team to not only have 
stars but also a supporting cast. 
The Tritons not only have some 
strong front runners, they also 
have a lot of depth, which bodes 
well for them as the season con-
tinues on. 

"Our team has a lot of bal-
ance," said Arsdale. "We have 
front runners and we also have a 
good balance of power up front 
and depth. On the women's side 
we have five who can be No. 1 
on any given week. It's not just 
the front runner, it's the depth," 
continued Van Arsdale. "Places 
4-7 are just as important as 1-3." 

Van Arsdale also said that he 
likes the dedication he sees from 
his squad, all of which seem to 
be motivated to improve on last 
years performance. 

"Besides balance, we're dedi-
cated," said Van Arsdale. "Many 
train twice a day, at 7:30 a.m . and 
3:30 p.m. What I see with the 
team is pride. The pride is fabu-
lous." 

The next meet for the Tritons 
will be in Salem, Ore. this 
Saturday at the Willamette 
University Invitational. The 
competition looks to be tough, 
but Van Arsdale is confident of a 
good showing. 

"From their performance 
Saturday," said Van Arsdale, "it 
looks like they're ready for a 
challenge."

NFL - that stands for No

that the National Football 
League should have accepted 
by now. 

It's been almost five years 
since the Raiders played their 
last home game in the L.A. 
Coliseum against the Kansas 
City Chiefs - a game in which 
Joe Montana knocked the sil-
ver and black out of the play-

So why has the league been 
desperately trying to replace 
the once thug-ridden confines 
of the coliseum with more of 
the same element? Despite

UCSD Spikes Competition 
Unparalelled depth and defense helps tritons ascend to a 13-1 record. 

By BRIAN WEllES 
Associate Sports Editor 

As UCSD ushers in fall '99 and 
with it a new school year, it is evi-
dent that there are certain things 
that haven' t changed - one of 
them being the dominance of the 
UCSD women's volleyball pro-
gram. The women's team has d is-
played early mastery by bolting 
out to a 13-1 start this year and 
are ranked second in Division III. 

Beginning with the University 
of Puget Sound Invitational on 
Sept. 10 in Tacoma, Wash., the 
Tritons distinguished themselves 
as a force to be reckoned with. 

On the fi rst day of the 
Invi tational, a battle between the 
Loggers of Puget Sound and the 
Tri tons beca me the showcase 
match and the contest certainly 
lived up to its bill ing. UC San 
Diego won the match in four 
ga mes 7-1 5, 15-8, 15-7, 15-11 . The 
Loggers took the first game with 
a 15-7 victory but UCSD put 
together an ensemble of impres-
sive rallies in the next three 
games to win the match that wit-
nessed outstanding defense on 
both sides. 

"We have dominated a lot of 
schools," Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland said of his team's per-
formance, "But in teams like 
Puget Sound we have seen some 
tough competition." 

Despite the fact that the season 
was still young, the Tritons 
showed that their offensive 
weaponry was as poignant as 
ever as Allison Bender and 
Kearney Visser contributed 10 
kills each. Leslie Punelli added 9 
kills and setter Christine 
Kueneman set up many of those 
with a staggering 45 assists. 

Usa Huff/Guardian 
a.ck At You: Laura Santerre and Jennifer McLain go up for a block in an early season match. 
Defense such as this are the reason the Tritons are off to a 13-1 start. 

Defensively, the Tritons main-
tained constant control over the 
game as UCSD accounted for 95 
digs. Once again, Visser made the 
opposing University of Puget 

Sound Loggers feel her presence 
on the court with 19 of those digs, 
while Sarah Castro also put a halt 
to the Logger attack with 18 digs. 

UCSD also defeated Simon 
Fraser University, George Fox 
and St. Martin's to wrap up the 
tournament with a 4-0 record. 
Furthermore, four of the 10 mem-
bers of the All-Tournament Team 
were UCSD Tritons. The four on 
that list included Kueneman, 
Visser, Kathleen Henz and Jamie 

Water Polo Team 
Shows Promise Early 
The Outset: Harper's squad begins 7-3 and 
looks dominant in conference play 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

Before the s tart of every 
men 's water polo season at 
UCSD, there are two questions in 
the mind of Head Coach Denny 
Harper. The first is how to win 
the conference tournament and a 
birth in the national semifinals, 
and the second is how to com-
pete with the full-scholarship 
powerhouses of the Mount 
Pacific Sports Federation. 

So far this year, Harper has to 
be pleased with his team's 
prospects on both of these issues 
- after the season's first 10 
matches, the Tritons are 7-3 and 
ranked 10th nationally. 

The Tritons started the season 
off with the UCSD Triton 
Invitational at Canyonview Pool. 

On the first day of the tourna-
ment, UCSD came away with 
two impressive victories. The 
first was a 20-3 thumping of 
Santa Clara University. The 

match's highlight was a stagger-
ing eight goals from two-meter 
man Jonathan Samuels. The 
three goals allOwed by the Triton. 
defense was the lowest total of 
the tournament by any team. 
In their second game, the Tritons 
faced the Air Force Academy, a 
conference rival and annually 
one of the toughest league tests 
for the Tritons. UCSD led 3-0 
after the first quarter and never 
looked back as they defeated the 
Air Force Academy 9-6. Ryan 
Dandy scored 4 goals including·] 
two-pointer to lead the Triton 
attack. 

On the second day of the 
tournament, -tlle Tritons started 
out with a 14-6 win over the 
University of Redlands. Again 
Samuels led the Tritons in scor-
ing with 6 goals. In the final 
match of the game, the 3-0 
Tritons faced off against 3-0 
Loyola Marymount University. 

See POLO, Page A30 

Hackleman. 
The Tritons returned home to 

face the University of Redlands 
on Sept. 15. Once again their per-
formance was spectacular result-
ing in a lopsided victory in three 
straight games 15-4, 15-4, 15-3 
and bringing their overall record 
for the season to 7-1. 

This time it was the effort of 
Laura Santerre who showed 
UCSD the way to Victory with an 
impressive 11 kills out of 15 

attempts for a .667 hitting per-
centage. Bender and Hentz also 
had 6 kills while Hentz turned in 
a .625 percentage. Bender turned 
in a defensive gem as well with 12 
digs, while Punelli kept the 
Redlands offense scratching its 
heads with nine. The women's 
total percentage of .407 dominat-
ed over Redlands' combined 
mark of .145.

Late . Goal Propels 
Tritons To Victory 
Surge: After a shaky beginning, the men's 
soccer team is coming on :;trong of late 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

Most of you have been dread-
ing the arrival of Sept. 30 
because it is the day school 
begins. With school, of course, 
comes work as well as the end of 
any relaxation that the last few 
days of summer break can pro-
vide. The men's soccer team, 
however, began its work on Sept. 
1, and the team has been going 
strong ever since. 

The UCSD 1999 men's soccer 
team has posted a record of 5-3-1 
after the first month of the fall 
season. Downing Christian 
Heritage at home Saturday 2-1, 
the Tritons have pushed their 
record two games over .500. 

UCSD took an early lead 
when Cameron Adams booted a 
pass from teammate Brady 
Bernard at the 11 :12 mark of the 
first half. Christian Heritage 
answered shortly thereafter 
when Jason Aldous received a 

pass from Phil Constantini at the 
30:38 mark to knot the game at 
1-1. 

With time running down and 
an extra period of play eminent, 
the Tritons' Joshua Davis, who 
started on the bench, took alass 
from Aleksandar Glebov an got 
a shot under Christian Heritage's 
goal-keeper Neil Saffer for the 
winning score. 

Saffer was berated by shots all 
day, giving up 2 goals while hav-
ing to make 6 saves. UCSD's goal 
keeper Luca Curtolo benefited 
from fine Triton defense. Curtolo 
only allowed 1 goal and was 
forced to save another. 

A 1-1 tie with SFSU kicked off 
the 1999 fall season for the 
Tritons. Robert Benowicz came 
through with a first-half goal off 
a Bernard pass at the 25:17 mark 
for an early lead. UCSD had to 
settle for a draw when SFSU 
drove in a penalty kick at the

College Offers New Experiences 
UCSD offers stuaents new academic and political experiences - if you're ready 
By JESSICA SCHEPPMANN 
Features Editor 

San Diego, California - home to UCSD, 
UCD, SDSU, and a myriad of junior colleges. 
College has long been a place where people go 
to explore their interests and increase their 
opportunities for financial success. However, 
since the 1960s and perhaps even earlier, educa-
tion has offered more then just marketable skills. 

Some students fail to see 
the opportunities that 
present themselves when 
they go away to college. 
Here are the best and the 
brightest individuals most 
of us will ever encounter on 
a daily basis. Here we are 
immersed in academic 
excellence. 

Students from all backgrounds go to UCSD 
to better themselves, their lives, and their minds. 
This is where you'll find freshly graduated high 
school seniors leaving home to discover their 
talents and find their place in the world. 

For those people catching their first glimpse 
of independence, welcome to UCSD. Congratu-
lations for making it to this point. This is your 
college experience, but this isn't necessarily real 
life. • 

Because of the ever changing times, students 
and potential students are finding there are a lot 
of different life experiences people can learn 
from. In turn, students are now coming in the 
form of returnees - those who come back to 
college after raising kids, exploring the world or 
working their way up. Some of these people 
messed up along the way, and some are just 
finding out that education is a great way to redi-
rect their lives. 

For those people, welcome to UCSD. 
Other people find themselves trapped in col-

lege. Perhaps parental pressure pushed them to 
this point; or perhaps conforming to the stan-
dard expectations of what makes a person 
"good" has brought them to this point. 

For those who are reluctant participants, wel-
come to UCSD but consider your other options 
before you waste everyone's time and money. 
Look into the returnee option.

The UCSD Guardian 

WELCOME: 
Opportunities can be 
found everywhere 
C ......... d ............ 

For everyone, college is an 
opportunity. Period. But it is the 
kind of opportunity that requires 
that we put in as much as we take 
out. The college experience, 
socially, academicallY.' politically 
and otherwise doesn t walk into a 
students dorm room and thunk 
people on the head. Students 
must seek out other students, 
social involvement, professors, 
and activities. 

Some students fail to see the 
opportunities that present them-
selves when they go away to col-
lege. Here are the best and the 
brightest individuals most of us 
will ever encounter on a daily 
basis. Here we are, immersed in 
academic excellence. 

(Scary isn't it. The number of 
idiots and assholes who think 
they know everything will only 
go up as your life progresses. 

Didn't seem possible, did it?) 
This is a place where educa-

tion can be explored, not just as a 
way to make money in the future, 
but as a way to create intelligent, 
thinking citizens who have been 
exposed to a variety of different 
view points. 

Education is no longer just 
about The Three R's - Reading, 
wRiting, and 'Rithmatic - stu-
dents are being given more 
opportunities to develop opin-
ions and thinking techniques that 
will be more valuable to them in 
the "real world" than any dry sta-
tistic or fact. Here at UC5D, the 
interdisciplinary approach gives 
students insights into all sorts of 
subjects and the opportunity to 
view the world from different 
perspectives outside those that 
we may have been spoon fed by 
our parents, friends or school 
administrators. 

Along with subjects like mol-
ecular biology, ~ngineering and 
management science, students 
can also succeed by studying 
ethnic studies, literature or one 
of the top rated Critical Gender 

1'ueIday. September 21. 1999 

Studies, formerly know as 
Women's Studies. By combining 
science degrees with these other 
areas of concentration, students 
are given opportunities to 'give 
depth and breadth to their acad-
emic pursuits. 

But this University isn't the 
liberal arts coUege I'm making it 
out to be. UC5D has some of the 
best science and mathematics 
departments and graduate pro-
grams available in the country. As 
the UC school that receives the 
most grant money of any other 
college, we have a lot of funds to 
build impressive facilities and to 
attract reputable faculty mem-
bers. This reputation for excel-
lence is a factor that a lot of stu-
dents take into account when 
choosing UCSD. 

As cliche as it sounds, school is 
what you make of it. You get that 
advice for free. Everything else 
you'll have to leam on your own. 

For all those new to college, or 
even new to the UC experience. 
congratulations. An opportunity 
(of a lifetime?) has just presented 
itself to you. Welcome.

STUART: 
Our unique library . 
featured in Star Trek 
Continued from paC. 112 
from Terry Allen's project, 
"Trees." These aluminum-cased 
trees each celebrate a different 
aspect of cu ltu re - one as a 
music tree, another acting as a 
literature tree and the final one 
- perhaps In reference to the 
art of listening - standing 
Si lently at the .end of LIbrary 
Wall-. . 

J list past the third tree sculp-
ture is Geisel library. If you 
thmk it looks Itke a giant, 
futuristic space building, you're 
not alone. During the 19 as the 
library was featured in Star 
Trel-. VI. Architecturally, it 
seems to be the library's only 
claim to artistic fame. The 
Geisel lobby now contains a 
varie ty of photography and 
story exhibits that change 
throughout the year. 

Heading toward Warren col-
lege from Geisel leads to Alexis 
Smith's wonderfull y scaly 
Sna ke Pa th. Starting from the 
top, where the snake's head is 
loca ted, a giant granite copy of 
Milton's Paradise Lost on the 
way down. Within the snake's 
coils lies a minia ture Garden of 

Eden adorned with an appropri-
ate quote from the book on a 
resting bench - "Then wi lt 
thou not be loa th to leave this 
Paradise, but sha lt possess a 
Paradise within thee, happier 
far." According to the Stuart 
web site, "These pointed allu-
sions to the biblical conflict 
between innocence and knowl-
edge mark an apt symbolic path 
to the universi ty's main reposi-
tory of books." 

Wal king past the tail at the 
base of the library, to the left is 
the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Engi-
neering Building and to the 
right IS the Center for Magnetic 
Record ing Research (CM RR).

The Stuart Collection Can Guide You 
The UCSD campus can be intimidating for entering students. Let o:rt guide the way. 
By JESYKA ASHLAR 
Associate Features Editor 

Students enteri ng UC 0 fo r 
the firs t time, and even those 
who haven' t been o n c~mpus for 
a while, m~y fi nd it more than ~ 
little intim i d ~ ting . With five col-
leges ilnd a wide arrilY of depar t-
ments, it 's easy to get los t. Lucki -
ly, howeve r, this milze is 
equipped wi th ma ny IJndmarks, 
all of which make ca mpus na vi-
ga tion e~sie r for s tud ents. 

The Stuart Collection has con-
venien tly placed SIgnifica nt 
works o ut ide, all of which help 
students ge t ~ feel for the campus 
and its layout. In 1982, UCSD 
and the StuJrt Foundation com-
bined e fforts to create an outdoor 
art collection on campus. The 
Stuart Collection now consist of 
13 comm issioned works by indi-
viduals whom hllp://www.side-
walksnlldiego.colII calls "some of 
the most prominent and contro-
versial public a rtists in the 
world ." These pieces are scat-
tered around campus and act not 
only as Significant and thought-
provoking works, but also as 
great location indicators. 

Starting in Muir, s tudents will 
find a wonderful read - Jenny 
Holze r 's "Green Table." A green 
marble table covered in quotes, 
this work is located under a 
group of trees on the edge of the 
Muir courtyard, which is bound-
ed by Humanities and Social Sci-
ences (H&SS), Applied Physics 
and Mathematics (AP&M), and 
Middle of Muir (MOM). H&SS 
houses Muir Writing, the Inter-
disciplinary Studies office and 
Muir Academic Advising. AP&M 
is whe re students check into e-
mail accounts. MOM houses a 
ca feteria , coffee shop, video 
rental s tore and general store. 

Continuing on the sidewalk, 
heading past the H&SS building, 
Thurgood Marshall College will 
emerge. Here, students and oth-
ers will find the economics build-

ing, Thurgood Marshall college 
admini trative offices, the Social 
Science Building (SSB) and 
RIMAC, UCSD's huge gym and 
the s ite o f numerous concerts 
and o the r entertaining perfor-
mances . Past RIMAC are the 
track and field areas a nd a soccer 
field . 

Ins tea d of walking toward 
Mars hall , one can al so head 
toward the Price Center, where 
he or he will come across Niki 
de aint Phalle's " un God ." 
Don' t make fun. During spring, 
the un God becomes the center 
of the biggest campus-wide festi-
val at UCSD. 

When facing this huge chick-
en-like bird, the Faculty Club is 
to the left and Mandeville Audi-
torium is on the right. Mo t stu-
dents never see the inside of the 
Faculty Club, but Mandeville 
Theater features student-accessi-
ble concerts, guest lectures, 
plays, musical performances and 
free movie screenings. Right now 
Mandeville is preparing for a free 
screening of "Mystery, Alaska" 
for s tudents. For free passes go to 
the Price Center Box Office at 
noon on Wednesday September 
29. The screening will take place 
at7p.m. 

Past Mandeville is the Stu-
dent Center, where many stu-
dent-run organizations and 
other businesses are located . 
Within the Student Center 
is the Grove Cafe, 
Groundwork 
Books, the local 
bike shop, AS. 
lecture notes, 
the Pub (where 
actual alcohol 
is served !); the 
Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual, 
Transsexual 
Association offices 
(LGBTA), Wells 
Fargo and Bank of 
America ATM 
machines. Also in the 

Student Center are the Guardiall 
and Koala. offices. The Student 
Center also has a multitude of 
other student club offices. 

On the other side of Mandev-
ille, for those heading toward 
central campus through the euca-

lyptus grove, note the 

giant, blue fence-like sculpture 
titled "Two Running Violet V 
Porms. " Although the actual 
artistic statement of this piece is a 
source of wide speculation, it 
was intended to mesh with its 
natural environment, reflecting 
light and shadows harmoniously. 
Within the eucalyptus grove is 

the Student 

Health Center, career center and 
the International Center. 

Students headed in the other 
direction, toward the Cognitive 
Science building (CSB) may get 
confused by the voices in this 
apparently "enchanted forest." 
Don't worry. The voices come 
from Terry Allen 's project, 
"Trees." These aluminum-cased

hit Aladdin. Bai Yook at Universi-
ty and Richmond serves Thai 
food, while nearby Ichiban has 
Japanese food and a sister estab-
lishment in Pacific Beach. Cafe on 
Park at Park Street and Universi-
ty Ave. has great brunches, lunch-
es and dinner, which is wonder-
ful but a bit more expensive. 

The best of all the food options 
in Hillcrest is on the dessert 
menu . One of the few Ben and 
Jerry's Scoop Shops in 5 '0,1 Diego 
is on University at Richmond, in 
the same strip mall as Bai Yook. 

Students on the hunt for a 
place to study and drink endless 
cups of coffee (as we students 
often do), Hillcrest offers a few 
options. Unlike its La Jolla coun-
terpart, the Living Room on Uni-
versity Avenue is student-friend-
ly, particularly on weekdays. 

Weekends get a little too noisy for 
studying to actually happen. 
Peel's Coffee & Tea at Fourth and 
University holds study possibili-
ties but less food, while The Cof-
fee Bean and Tea Leaf on Fifth 
Avenue is a busier place to chat 
with friends. Be forewarned of 
the outdoor smoking population 
at high-traffic times. 

The Landmark Theater in 
Hillcrest offers a wonderful 
array of foreign films for those 
willing to read subtitles. Even if 
reading a movie does not appeal, 
this theater presents indepen-
dent films that simply do not 
make it to the local AMC. Weeks 
before "The Blair Witch Project" 
made it to more mainstream 
locations, it was sold out at the 
Hillcrest cinema. The unfortu-
nate drawback to this theater is 
that there are no student or mati-
nee discounts. 

Wandering through the 
neig hborhood , particularly on 
Fifth Ave. between Robinson St. 
and University Ave. there are a 
number of book stores, both 

used and new. Stop in to check 
out Bluest<x;king, Blue Door, and 
Bountiful Books. On University 
Ave., give Obelisk and Footnote 
a try. 

For a unique shopping expe-
rience, drop in at Babette 
Schwartz on University Ave. 
between Fourth St. and Fifth St. 
This store is filled with great 
campy gifts and a wonderful 
selection of humorous, sarcastic 
and pop culture nostalgia cards. 
The T-shirts and toys alone are 
worth a visit. 

There are also a few recycled 
and vintage clothing stores in 
Hillcrest. 6uffalo Exchange han-
dles used clothing and has a sister 
store in Pacific Beach. Flashbacks 
lets anyone go really retro. Wear 
It Again Sam is a more upscale 
Vintage shop on Park Ave. at Uni-
versity Ave. 

For UCSD students who tire 
easily of the La Jolla lifestyle, 
Hillcrest provides a diverse and 
accepting alternative in its wide

rants, retail stores and more.

By JESYKA ASHLAR 
Associate Features Editor 

Hillcrest, one of the many 
communities of San Diego, is a 
casual and friendly neighborhood 
rich in diversity. Carrying its own 
unique cultural flavor, it is wel-
coming to its visitors and defi-
nitely worth checking out. 

Heading there from campus, 
hop 1-5 South down to 1-8 West to 
163 South, landing you in the cor-
rect lane to exit University

Take a right at the first light to be 
on University Avenue and the

While the biggest celebrations 
in Hillcre t happen in the sum-

session, the spirit of the celebra-
tions colors the lifestyle and atti-
tude of the locals. The annual

Although this year 's event was

appalled yet remained deter-
mined to celebrate tol erance,

City Fest, also an annual event

For those "Star Wars" buffs 

out there, the San Diego Museum 
of Art is hosting the Smithsonian

venue. Tickets, which are for spe-
cific dates and times, may be pur-
chased by calling the museum. 
Student discount rates apply to 
both weekday and weekend time 
slots. 

The World Famous San Diego 
Zoo does not offer discounted 
day rates but does have a yearly 
student membership for $29. Sea 
World gives 20 percent off day 
rates. But again, the UCSD Box 
Office is a great resource. It offers 
discounted tickets to Sea World, 
the San Diego Zoo, Knottsberry 
Farms, Lego Land and Magic 
Mountain. The Box Office also 
sells See's Candy at a discount of 
about $2 a pound. 

The UCSD Guardian 

If you've eaten too much 
chocolate and happen to feel the 
need to exercise off campus, 24-
Hour Fitness has a current pro-
motion for students. You can 
choose between 3 months for 
$124 with 7 days-a-week access, 
or pay $59 down and $21 a 
month to workout four days a 
week. 

The Lawrence Family Jewish 
Community Center (JCC) also 
offers student discounts on mem-
berships. The JCC has a fifty 
meter pool, a weight room and 
offers classes for members and 
non-members alike. The JCC is 
much like RIMAC and Canyon 
View in its services, which are 
free to UCSD students, so the 
only advantage is the Jewish cul-
tural activities. 

When planning an escape 
from the hectic pace that UCSD 
provides, Council Travel, located 

in the Price Center, has access to 
student fares if you have one of 
its International Student Identity 
Cards (ISIC). This costs about 
$20, but check it out because it 
could save you considerably 
more than that on airfare. Also, 
Council Travel will give you a 
booklet with a listing of muse-
ums, shuttles, hotels, ('tc. that rec-
ognize the ISIC card to cut you a 
break. 

Although Hosteling Interna-
tional does not offer a student 
discount for membership pur-
chases, there are certain hostels 
in the United States and Europe 
that offer discounts. 

No matter what, however, 
these hostels offer reasonable 
mtes around the country for trav-
elers working with a minimal 
budget. Student discount ISIC 
cards are offered in Europe for a 
small fee and will earn discounts

and other services traveling stu-

Cloud Nine Shuttle also caters 
to UCSD students by taking them 
to and from the airport for a rea-
sonable price ($12) each way. 
Many people find that these 
prices are cheaper then other taxi 
services, and using this service 
won't inconvenience busy room-
mates. 

While the necessities of life, 
like groceries and fuel, don't 
seem to come with any student 
budget consciousness, a number 
of businesses do make some 
effort to assist students with the 
costs of living. The university 
does its best to help out, after tak-
ing all of your money for tuition 
and books and parking. By tak-

Businesses Appreciate Student Hardship 
Starving students can save money by shopping at caring companies that give student discounts 
By JESYKA ASHLAR 
Associate Features Editor 

Students have long been rec-
ognized as poor - they strive to 
earn degrees that not only cost 
them money but simultaneously 
strip them of time that could be 
committed to a well-paying job. 

Places of interest to students 
have benefited from the symbiot-
ic relationship with students by 
discounting services that allow 
for increased patronage. Muse-
ums, theaters, restaurants and 
retail stores recognize students' 
financial disadvantage and allow 
for breaks. 

So, as we embark on another 
year, it's good to look around and 
realize that those plastic I.D. 
cards with bad pictures are good 
for something. Students are 
allowed free access to the gym 
and racquetball courts at RIMAC 
and to the pool and rock climbing 
at Canyon View. 

Additionally, discounts are 
offered at the gaming room at 
Price Center and at Grove Cafe at 
the Student Center. Besides these 
on-campus perks, there are a 
number of off-campus returns on 
all those checks made out to the 
UC Regents. 

Not that there will be much to 
put there, but local banks offer 
certain accounts with students in 
mind . Bank of America offers free 
checking to anyone who can 
prove full-time student status, 
which requires a printout of 
classes. Generally, this entails a 
Versatel account, which requires 
all transactions to be done 

through the ATM, otherwise 
patrons are charged $2 for talking 
to a person, unless they're asking 
for something the ATM can't do. 

Union Bank has changed its 
old student checking to basic 
checking. It's $3 a month plus 75 
cents for every check past your 
fifth of the month. It also has 
incentives to use online banking. 
Wells Fargo's student checking 
account is free during the sum-
mer months, and $4.50 a month 
during the academic year. All of 
the banks offer free checking if 
you use direct deposit. 

If shopping for items to fill 
one of many ever-changing resi-
dences, stop by Pier 1 before Oct. 
2. Until then, the store is offering 
a 15 percent discount to people 
with a college 1.0. card. Unfortu-
nately, the discount does not 
apply to sale items. 

Tower Records takes $2 off 
every regularly priced compact 
disc purchase for shoppers who 
have a Student Consumer Card, 
which are available at EDNA . 
The card is worth picking up - it 
also offers discounts at Music 
Trader, 24-Hour Fitness, Fins, 
jamba juice, Winston Tires and 
others. 

At the box office on campus, 
students are usually offered first 
pick and discounted prices for all 
performances at RIMAe. In the 
past this opportunity has applied 
to tickets for Counting Crows, 
The Artist, Maya Angelou and 
others. 

During the vendor fairs that 
occur on campus at the begin-
ning of each quarter, The Sail 

Diego UlliOIl-Tribulle discounts its 
delivery rates for students. Those 
looking for subscriptions to 
newspapers can often get dis-
counts from other papers around 
the country, as well . 

For student artists, buying art 
supplies at the bookstore is a 
poor idea when looking for dis-
counted rates. The Art Store on 
India St. in Little Italy in the-
downtown area offers a discount 
to student artists looking for a 
break. 

Looking for film entertain-
ment? All AMC theaters offer a 
student discount. Until 6 p.m., 
students pay the same as every-
body else. However, only stu-
dents get to keep the $4.50 price 
tag at night when everyone else 
pays $8.50. 

The absolute best deal you'll 
get on movies, however, is 
through the Box Office in the 
Price Center. While AMC tickets 
and Pacific Theaters tickets are 
$4.50, and Edward Cinemas tick-
ets are just $4, the theater in Price 
Center shows two movies a 
week, usually one classic and one 
new release, for $2 a ticket. Peri-
odic all campus e-n:'ails are sent 
out regarding the scheduling of 
these movies. 

Not that it will help out dur-
ing the quarter, but Hollywood 
Video gives one free rental to 
anyone who shows up with their 
grades. There is no GPA require-
ment attached.

Fall Movie Preview 
Once again, Hollywood unveils its upcoming 
season of films, and as always there are gems 

Oct. 1 

~~~!l' i~I~S~ated city in the 
state of Alaska. From an outsider's per-
spective, the town appears cold and 
unexciting. Truth be told, however, 
Mystery has all the sex scandals, gov-
ernment corruption and neighborhood 
rivalries of any city in the United States. 
Plus, it's got a pretty good hockey team. 

When a human interest story in a 
national magazine puts the small 
town under the gaze of the nation, 
Mystery suddenly finds itself on the 
map. When the town's amateur hock-
ey team accepts the challenge of a 
face-off against the New York 
Rangers, the residents of Mystery are 
forced to finally put their petty rival-
ries behind them. 

Outlook: Stories of human triumph 
rarely generate enough sympathy in the 
characters to make the story truly 
meaningful. Hopefully, Mystery's citi-
zens will be engaging enough to carry 
the plot. 

Drive Me Crazy 
Nicole (Melissa joan Hart) and 

Chase (Adrian Grenier) are nothing 
alike. She's up on the latest fashions; 
he's involved in the newest protest. She 
wouldn't miss a pep rally; he can usual-
ly be found in some dark coffee house. 

Though they may be dissimilar, the 
two neighbors find themselves single in 
the midst of high school. In order to 
make their exs jeafous, the two reluc-
tantly join forces. In the process, Nicole 
and Chase find that the one they alwllys 
wanted was closer than they ever real-
ized . 

. Outlook: The latest in a long line of 
high school love stories. This film has 
little chance of standing out among the 
sea of recent teenage dramas. 

Elmo In Grouchland 
Elmo, the fuzzy red monster from 

"Sesame Street" who refers to himself in 
the third person, loves his fuzzy, well-
~orn blue blanket better than anything 
10 the whole world . When Elmo is faced 
with the fact that he has lost his blanket 
in Oscar's trash can, the little monster 
summons all of his courage and deter-
mination and sets off on an action-

packed rescue mission that plunges him 
into Grouchland. In the process, Elmo 
learns an important lesson about shar-
ing, friendship and responsibility. 

Outlook: For everyone who grew up 
loving "Sesame Street," there's nothing 
better than seeing it on the big screen. 
Yeah, it's for kids, but lighten up! 

H~E¥' i!~~~:ell known for the 
sleepy town of Happy, where the 
biggest event is the annual Little Miss 
Fresh-Squeezed Beauty Pageant. Unfor-
tunately, community support is waning 
this year, and even the pageant may not 
happen. 

In order to make it to state finals, a 
famous gay couple is hired to direct the 
show. In awe of these "professionals," 
no one in town notices that the "boys" 
are actually escapees from a West Texas 

~hain gang and have unwittingly rolled 
mto town in a stolen RY, mysteriously 
stocked with a sewing machine, span-
dex and sequins. 

With the Texas Rangers hot on their 
trail and the local bank just ripe for the 
picking, it seems like the perfect place to 
bite the bullet, lay low and get down to 
the business at hand - putting on the 
pageant. 

Outlook: Steve Zahn and William H. 
Macy star in this comedy, which sounds 
suspiciOUSly like a remake of other, clas-
sic, "mistaken identity" stories. Never-
theless, convicts disguised as beauty 
pageant experts sure sounds funny. 

Three Kin~s 
As the Gu~ War grinds to a halt, 

three American soldiers devise a plan to 
steal a huge load of gold bullion from 
Saddam Hussein. Sergeant Major 
Archie Gates (George Clooney) is 
scheduled to retire in two weeks, 
Sergeant Troy Barlow (Mark Whalberg) 
has recently become a father and Chief 
Elgin (Ice Cube) is on a four-month paid 
vacation from Detroit. 

On their way to collect their booty 
they witness the disturbing results of 
the war effort. President Bush has 
encouraged Iraqi citizens to rise up 
against Saddam and has pledged to 
support them, yet no American support

MOVIES: 
Hollywood chums 
out the usual suspects 
Continued from PIC- 811 
has been delivered . As the sol-
diers realize the true situation in 
Iraq, they' re confronted with 
their own humanity, and they' re 
fo rced to rethink who they are 
and what they' re doing. 

Ollt/ook: Part comedy, part 
action, part drama, this film may 
be trying to be too much. On the 
other hand, its serious side sheds 
light on the effects of war. 

Oct. 8th 

Random Hearts 
Dutch Van Den Broeck (Har-

rison Ford), a tough internal 
affairs officer involved in a high-
stakes corruption case, and Kay 
Chandler (Kristin Scott 
Thomas), a congresswomen 
embroiled in a bitter re-election 
campaign develop an extraordi-
nary relationship after their 
spouses die in a plane crash, on 
which they were sitting together. 
The consequences of the acci-
dent force the two widows to 
confront the truth about their 
spouses' secret lives. 

Ollt/ook: Harrison Ford and 
Kristin Scott Thomas seem to be 

capable of so much more than a 
cheesy love story. This is bound 
to be one of those films that you 
knew Hollywood had to make. 

Superstar 
All Mary Katherine Gallagher 

(Molly Shannon) wants in life is a 
kiss. Not just any kiss, but a big-
time, hold-your-breath-till-you-
think-you're-going-to-faint, Hol-
lywood-style kiss. But no matter 
how hard she tries, no one will 
kiss her. 

Eventually, Mary realizes 
that the only way she is going 
to get kissed is to become just 
like the people in the movies. 
When a national magazine 
sponsors a dance contest and 
the chance to be a movie extra, 
Mary jumps at the opportunity 
to make all her dreams come 
true. 

Out/ook: Following the foot-
steps of "It's Pat" and" A Night at 
the Roxburry," Shannon is bring-
ing her painfully creepy, catholic 
schoolgirl character to the big 
screen. Whatever happened to 
good "SNL" movies like 
"Wayne's World"? 

M~lrlY Mackey (Elizabeth 
Shue) is a mentally challenged 
young woman whose genius is 
unleashed after she undergoes a 
program of highly experimental

treatments. Her brother Buck's 
(Aaron Eckhart) carefree lifestyle 
is turned on its side when he 
must care for the sister he hasn't 
seen since they were both chil-
dren. 

Ollllook: Think of it as a cross 
between "The Other Sister" and 
"At Fi~t Sight." If you liked these 
films you're bound to enjoy 
"Molly."

Mr. Accident 
"Mr. Accident" is the story of a 

terminally accident-prone guy 
(Yahoo Serious) who discovers 
his employer's plans to market 
nicotine-injected eggs. Enlisting 
the help of the· boss' UFO-
obsessed girlfriend, he unravels 
the insidious scheme and wins 

her heart. 
Olltlook: Such a plot could only 

come from the mind of the film's 
writer, director and star, Mr. Seri-
ous.

MOVIES: 
Big stars and strong 
scripts fuel films 
CoIdI ...... froM PIC- 820 
that you are not your job. You are 
not how much you have in the 
bank. You are not the contents of 
your wallet. You are not · your 
khakis. You are not a beautiful 
and unique snowflake. Tyler says 
the things you own end up own-
ing you, and it's only after you've 
lost everything that you're free to 
do anything. 

Tyler's fight Club represents 
that kind of freedom by creating 
an environment in which people 
can release their aggressions by 
hitting each other as hard as they 
can. 

Oullook: Grown men discard-
ing their possessions and beating 
the living hell out of each other 
may sound a Ii~ too bizarre to 
be a good film. However, this 
kind of departure from typical 
storylines is bound to be a 
refreshing change. 

The Story of Us 
In the midst of a seemingly 

wonderful marriage, Ben (8ruce 
Willis) and Katie (Michelle Pfeif-
fer) have somehow run out of 
steam and the time has come to 
weigh the consequences of a 
divorce. Do they ' make their 
investment in each other's work 
after all of these years or do they 
cut their losses and move on 
before they hurt everyone that 
they love? 

This is a witty and touching 
story of two individualistic pe0-
ple who are forced to come to 
terms with the fact that they just 
might be too different after all. 

Ollllook: While "Step mom" 
examined the pain that families 
suffer after a divorce, "The Story 
of Us" looks at marriage and the 
cracks that force people to ques-
tion whether they should stay 
together. 

Oct. 22 

B1~~ir~ie~~J~~01~~e) 
is a paramedic who's haunted by 
visions of the ghosts of people he 
was unable to save. "Bringing 
Out the Dead" chronicles 48 
hours in the life of this man 
whose world becomes more fran-
tic every moment. 

Olltlook: Martin Scorsese 
directs this film and brings a cre-
ative feel to the madness the pri-
mary character is suffering from. 
Cage excels in such roles. 

An~;~!~~w~e~~edOm, 
a restless mother (Susan Saran-
don) drags her reluctant teenage 
daughter (Natalie Portman) to 
Beverly Hills and into a new, and 
sometimes difficult, life. As the 
mother and daughter struggle to 
adjust to their new environment 

and each other, they develop an 
understanding that holds them 
together. 

Ollllook: While the two films 
are probably nothing alike, "The 
Slums of Beverly Hills" has a 
more appealing premise and 
characters than this recent offer-
ing. 

Cr~}~~~~~TJs, a back-
woods Alabama boy named Pee-
joe (LuCliS Black) - short for 
Peter Joseph - is about to 
become educated In matters of 
freedom. The catalyst of his 
awakening is his glamorous, 
eccentric Aunt Lucille (Melanie 
Griffith), who escapes from the 
clutches of her abusive husband 
and takes off for Hollywood to 
pursue her dreams of television 
stardom. Antonio Banderas 
directs his wife in his directorial 
debut. 

Olltlook: Everything that Grif-
fith is involved in comes out hor-
ribly and despite the fact that 
Banderas may prove to be an out-
standing director, this film's aura 
is pitch black. 

The Best Man 
"The Best Man" reveals the 

intimate side of life for a group of 
successful college friends who are 
reunited at the wedding of one of 
their buddies. With vows about to 
be exchanged, the groom's best 
man Harper ('faye Diggs), a com-
mitment-phobiC writer, worries 
that his friend (Morris Chestnut) 
will find out that he once had an 
affair with his soon-to-be wife 
(Monica Calhoun). 

Oullook: As ' with "Mystery, 
Alaska:' this film will only be car-
ried by the support of its actors 
and the quality of its writing. 

B~~~~~~mething men 
and women set off on a wild ride 
through the notorious nightlife of 
Los Angeles, they get more than 
they bargained for. Fueled by the 
need for love and intimacy, the 
evening takes them on a crash 
course through the turbulent 
world of sex and dating in the 
'90s. 

Ollllook: The premise sounds 
like a cross between "Swingers" 
and "Pulp Fiction," as the story is 
told. from multiple perspectives 
throughout the long night of 
club-hopping. 

Bats 
When the small Texas town of 

Gallup experiences a series of 
inexplicable bat attacks on local 
residents, the government calls 
upon eminent wildlife zoologist 
Dr. Sheila Casp'er (Dina Meyer) to 
investigate. Sh:ila teams up with 
town sheriff Emmett Kimsey 
(Lou Diamond Phillips) to dis-
cover why these nocturnal mam-
mals have changed their behavior 
and try to destroy the swarm's 
cave before the killing spreads. 

Ollllook: If you didn't get your 

fill from killer crocodiles and 
killer sharks last summer, then 
consider killer bats. In the classic 
vein of "Arachnophobia" and 
"The Birds" comes "Bats." 
<Shudder> 

Oct. 29 

Being John Malkovich 
A puppeteer Oohn Cusack) 

discovers a door in his office that 
allows him to enter the mind of 
and literally become the famous 
actor John Malkovich for 15 min-
utes. Cusack tries to parlay this 
experienO! in a money-making 
venture, but finds himself with a 
choice between a life of fantasy 
and deception or reality and 
truth. Cameron Diaz also stars 
along with John Malkovich, play-
ing himself. 

Olltlook: Few films this season 
sound as tantalizing and creative 
as "Being John Malkovich." For 
anyone who's ever seen anything 
this actor's been in, the concept of 
entering his mind seems both an 
amusing and frightening venture. 

Princess Mononoke 
After being wounded and poi-

soned in battle, a prince (Billy 
Crudup) searches the wilderness 
for a cure. In the process he stum-
bles across ancther battle 
between a young girl, the 
Princess Mononoke (Claire 
Danes), and the people of an iron-
mining village whose mine is 
threatening to unbalance the 
forces of nature. 

This nature-based epic has 
become one of Japan's highest 
grossing films ~ver. Minnie Dri-
ver, Gillian Anderson, Jada Pin-
kett and Billy Bob Thorntof;l: also 
lend their voices to this animated 
masterpiece. 

Outlook: Look out Disney, 
Japanese anime is crossing the 
pond and seizing the spotlight. 
This high-grossing film has cer-
tainly made the right move by re-
recording the voice acting with 
American actors to appeal to a 
wide audience. 

Nov. 5 
The Bachelor 

A confirmed bachelor (Chris 
O'Donnell) has 24 hours to find a 
bride (Renee Zellweger) and get 
married in order to collect a $100 
million inheritance. 

Olltlook: Where's the conflict in 
this story? Chris O' Donnell is 
rich, Single and desperately needs 
to find someone to marry. 
Shouldn't be that tricky. 

The Bone Collector 
"The Bone Collector" is a sus-

pense-thriller in which two cops 
follow the trail of a brutal serial 
killer. The two police must see as 
one, act as one and think as one 
before the next victim fall s.

Oil/look: Think "The Silence of

oned Hannibal Leeter with the

Jolie and Washington work togeth-
er should be quite interesting. 

The Insider 
On the verge of exposing one 

of the decade's most incendiary 
public health issues, "60 Min-
utes" television producer Lowell 
Bergman (AI Pacino) must con-
vince former tobacco industry 
insider Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Rus-
sell Crowe) to reveal the truth 
about the practices of cigarette 
companies, but the consequences 
to Wigand's career and family 
may be disastrous. 

Oil/look: Bound to be one of the 
more dramatic films of the sea-
son. Pacino an~ Crowe are per-
fectly cast in their rolls and the 
history of the tobacco lobby alone 
should produce a fantastic plot. 

U~~rL~i~~n accidental shoot-
ing in a battered, inner-city high 
school, a disparate group of stu-
dents hold a wounded police offi-
cer (Forest Whitacker) hostage. 
As media and public interest 
intensifies, the classmates unex-
pectedly band together to help 
themselves and their school. 

Ollliook: Violen'ce in inner city 
chools is 'now a well-known 

motif for motion pictures. This 
film, however, may succeed in 
putting a fresh face on the dan-
gers and triumphs of students in 
such environments.

(Alan Rickman), a hitherto

(Salma Hayek) and two unlikely

Ollt/ook: The creator of 
"Clerks," "Mallrats" and "Chas-
ing Amy" seems to do no wrong 
when it comes to writing and 
directing clever and funny stories. 
In "Dogma," Smith is armed with 
a stellar supporting cast in addi-

(Desmond Llewelyn), but this 
time he's not just fighting to save 
the world : the terrorist has kid-
napped MOudy Dench). 

Olll/ook: The usual explosions, 
nifty gadgets and blatant chau-
vinism abound in this 19th Bond 
film in the series. How it will 
stack up against the previous two 
Brosnan Bond films remains to be 
seen. 

Sleepy Hollow 
In the woods near the tiny 

New England vHlage of Sleepy 
Hollow of the late 18th century, 
bodies are being discovered . Bod-
ies without heads. Ichabod Crane 
Oohnny Depp) vows to seek out 
the killer, who he believes to be a 
living villain, despite the towns-
people's assurances that the foe is 
quite certainly otherworldly. Tim 
Burton directs this appropriately 
creepy tale of the Headless 
Horseman. 

Olll/ook: Burton is the master 
of dark, creepy imagery. This 
retelling of the classic tale has the 
perfect mix of action, terror and 
mystery. 

Nov. 24 

End of Days 
Jericho Cane (Arnold 

Schwarzenegger), a beaten down 
ex-cop, is the reluctant hero who 
is unwittingly drawn into a heart-
stopping, supematural game of 
cat and mouse with the ultimate 
personification of evil in "End of 
Days," a chilling thriller set at the 
cusp of the millennium. As the 
countdown to the end of days 
approaches, all that stands in the 
way of mankind's destruction is 
the salvation 0" one woman 
(Robin Tunney), whose fate rests 
in Cane's sl,aky hands. 

Outlook: Simply put, 
Schwarzenegger needs a good 
movie. He's pulled off some 
amazing performallCes as the 
muscle-bound hero before, but 
his recent films have paled in 
comparison. 

Anna and the King 
Set in the 19th century, "Anna 

and the King" is the true story of 
British governess Anna 
Leonowens Oodie Foster), who is 
employed by the King of Thai-
land (Chow Yun-Fat) to look after 
his many children. Soon after she 
arrives in this exotic country, 
Leonowens finds herself engaged 
in a battle of wits with the strong-
willed ruler. 

Olll/ook: This 1999 rendition of 

The UCSD Guard;"!! 

the classic story has astounding 
star power with Foster and Chow 
who team up to engage in this 
stirring tale of a woman who 
challenged a king and changed 
the shape of a nation. 

TOl ~!O~3 to the landmark, 
1995, computer-animated block-
buster from Walt Disney Pictures 
and Pixar Animation Studios, the 
toys are left to their own devices 
after their owner Andy goes off to 
camp for the summer. When an 
obsessive toy collector kidnaps 
Woody (Tom Hanks) - who has-
n't the slightest clue that he is a 
greatly valued collectible - Buzz 
Lightyear (Tim Allen) leads the 
toys on an adventure through the 
city in search of their friend . 

Oul/ook: Disney and Pixar's 
"Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life" 
revolutionized the fully-digital 
movie scene and "Toy Story 2" 
will undoubtedly continue the 
trend. However, a good storyline 
and dazzling new effects will be 
crucial to continue the style. 

Dec. 10 

Scream 3 
Neve Campbell, Courteney 

Cox Arquette and David Arquette 
return to Wes Craven's "Scream." 
In this final installment of the tril-
ogy, Sidney Prescott (Campbell) 

has traveled to Los Angeles to fol-
low her acting dreams. When the 
cast and crew of the movie sud-
denly start dying, Gale Weathers 
and Dewey Riley (the newly-mar-
ried Arquettes) investigatl! the 
murders along with others. 

Outlook: "Scream" probably 
should have stopped while it was 
ahead. The sequel was a dismal 
offering and the fact that Kevin 
Williamson has removed himself 
from the. third movie doesn't 
bode well for a clever storyline. 

G~~~t9Ut~~\oPular sci-fi 
series "Star Trek," "Galaxy Quest" 
is the story of five aging actors 
whose "Stdr Trek" -style series was 
canceled 20 years earlier. When a 
group of fans at a sci-fi convention 
tum out to be aliens who have mis-
interpreted intercepted television 
transmissions as "historical docu-
ments," the actors are captured, 
taken into space and asked to help 
win a war against a deadly adver-
sary. With no script, the actors 
must put on the performance of 
their lives to become the heroes the 
aliens believe them to be. 

Olltlook: "Star Trek" spoofs or 
sci-fi spoofs in general are always 
good for a laugh. Ever since 
William Shatner told a conven-
tion of trekkers to "get a life" on 
an episode of "Saturday Night 
Live," mocking and poking fun at 

Thesday. September 28. 1999 

"Star Trek" has become a guaran-
teed chuckle. 

December 17 

Bicentennial Man 
An android (Robin Williams), 

who is purchased as a household 
robot programmed to perform 
menial tasks, begins to experience 
emotions and creative lhought in 
a story that spans two centuries. 
In the process, the metal man 
learns the intricacies of humanity, 
life and love. . 

Outlook: Robin Williams has 
been on a good role these past 
few years, however this film 
looks a lot like the poorly 
received "Being Human." 

The Green Mile 
An extraordinary tale set on 

death row in a Southem prison in 
1935, "The Green Mile" is the 
remarkable story of the cell 
block's head guard (Tom Hanks), 
who develops a poignant, unusu-
al relationship with one inmate 
(Michael Duncan) who possesses 
a magical gift that is both myste-
rious and miraculous. 

Olltlook: Oscar-talk is already 
beginning to stir for this rather 
unique tak~on the classic prison 
film. All of the elements involved 
in this film's creation point 
towards a successful and popular 
release.

City View: Del Mar 
Genuine Beach town without the requisite tourist atmosphere that occurs in other areas 
By MelE LYNN JUNO 
Senior Staff ~er 

For those looking for something to do in 
San Diego, try visiting the sands of the Del 
Mar beaches. Located between Carmel Val-
ley Road and-Via de la Valle Road, Del Mar 
is "where the surf meets the turf." This 
small city has become popular due to its 
sandy beaches, quaint shops and the 
world-famous Del Mar Fairgrounds. 

Often noted for their surf, Del Mar 
beaches boast waves that are gentle, glassy 
and prime for surfing. Fourth-year UCSD 
student and local surfer Laurie Williams 
says the beaches have a friendly swell and 
good breaks. Surfers, however, are not the 
only ones who continuously frequent the 
two-and-a-half mile stretch of Del Mar 
beach. 

According to Lifeguard · Chief Patrick 
Vergne, during summer, Del Mar's beaches 
will average over 15,000 visitors on a typi-
cal Saturday. Over 75 percent are patrons 
(sunbathers and people walking alongside 
the shore), and the remaining 25 percent 
are swimmers and surfers. Of course, 
weekends are busier than weekdays, with 
11 lifeguards on duty during Saturday and 
Sunday while eight watch the beach dur-
ing the week. Summer lifeguard hours are 
9 a.m. to 8 p.m. and winter hours are 9 a.m. 
t05p.m. 
. "Whenever coming to the beach always 
swim in front of a lifeguard and keep chil-
dren under close supervision," said 
Vergne. 

For those who aren't charmed by the 
sand, a multitude of shops and restaurants 
also exist. Located north of 15th Street, the 
Del Mar Plaza boasts clothing boutiques, 
jewelry stores, art galleries, home furnish-
ings stores and hair salons. The Del Mar 
Plaza brochure says it best, "Shop where 
indulgence is encouraged, taste rewarded 

. 

and serenity revered." With the shops and 
the eclectic combination of surf and sand 
only a stroll away, this plaza beckons to 
people of all ages. 

Perhaps the most famous aspect of Del 
Mar is the world-renown Del Mar Fair-
grounds. The Del Mar Fairgrounds and 
Racetrack can be found between Jimmy 
Durante Boulevard and Via De La Valle 
Road. It is known for its annual fair and 
horse races and is a must-see for those liv-
ing anywhere in San Diego. 

During the 1999 season, the fair lasted 
for two weeks, running June 16 - July 5 and 
came complete with carnival rides, con-
certs, hypnotist shows, and of course 
delectable corn dogs and cotton candy. 
During these two weeks, the fair's atten-
dance was clocked at 1,155,112 attendees. 

The Del Mar Fair also presents a spec-
tacular fireworks show on Independence 
Day, which includes a grandstand concert. 
The fireworks are free and the proud sense 
of patriotism is one not to be missed. 

Following the Del Mar Fair comes the 
exciting and much anticipated Del Mar 
Horse Races. Gambling lovers beware -
the racetrack features multiple betting 
options on many different thoroughbred 
horses. These races offer a 20-second 
adrenaline rush as the horses near the fin-
ishing point. This year the Del Mar Races 
opened on July 22, and the festivities con-
tinued until Sept. 8. On some Friday 
nights, concerts featuring a variety of 
bands including G-Funk types, Common 
Sense and B-Side Players were given after 
the conclusion of the day's last race. 

Whether it is for the visually tantaliz-
ing realm of the seashore, the diverse 
selection of shops or the fast-paced excite-
ment of the fairgrounds, the city of Del 
Mar has numerous sites that make it wor-

Close to Campus 

For most on-campus dwe llers, 
the majority of San Diego's attrac-
tive mov ie thea ters lie out of 
reach. However, there are two 
thea ters wi thin wal king d ista n e 
that ho ld thei r own. 

The AMC La Jolla 12 Thea ters 
and the Landmark La Jolla Village 
Cinemas are both located just down 
the street from UCSD on Villa La 
Jolla Drive. Despite their conve-
nient locations, however, neither 
offers stadium seating, and only the 
AMC offers student discoun ts.

For tho e who have access to 
speedier transportation than their 
own two f~e t, the AMC Mission

biggest and nices t thea ters. 

Bo th thea ters are located in 
large malls and offer student dis-

Downtown 

If you 're going to make an 
evening of your movie-going 
experience, you may want to con-
sider the theaters in downtown 
San Diego. 

The VA Horton Plaza sits atop 
San Diego's flashiest mall while 
the Pacific Gaslamp 15 sits among 
the Gaslamp Quarter 's 50 restau-
rants. Neither offer student dis-
counts and parking is tricky. Both

theaters, however, are only a

Finally, if mainstream block-

busters don't appeal, there are 
several theaters that screen more 
artistic and foreign films. 

The Hillcrest Cinemas in Hill-

Culture, Drama and Art 
Balboa Park has something interesting and beautifol to share with everyone 
By WALT DICKINSON 
Hiatus Editor 

Just off the southern end of 
Highway 163 and slightly north 
of downtown San Diego lies Bal-
boa Park - a collection of 16 
museums, four performing arts 
venues, nine gardens and a slew 
of various cultural events. 

To both long-time res idents 
and those new to San Diego who 
have never visited the park before, 
Balboa Park has something to 
offer; be it paintings, sculptures, 
photography, IMAX film s, live 
theater or even rare motorcycles. 
Museums 

The backbone of Balboa Park is 
its diverse collection of museums. 
The San Diego Museum of Art, for 
example, is currently hos ting 
"'Star Wars'; The Magic of Myth." 
This collection of original concept 
art, costumes and props used in 
the creation of the origi nal trilogy 
emphasizes the connection 
between "Star Wars" and classica l 
mythology and world culture. 

The Sa n Diego atural Histo-
ry Museum features exhibits that 
display the flora and fauna of the 
Southwest region in addition to 
organizing an array of trips and 
outings. 

[n addition to the arts, Balboa 
Park's Reuben H. Fleet Space 
Theater Science Center offers 
opportunities to study the sci-
ences. While this museum is pri-
marily geared toward children, 
many of the exhibits are intrigu-
ing to adults, as well. 
Uve Theater 

Aside from the museums, Bal-

Brian Moghadam/ Guardian 
R.n.ct: The pond just across from the botanical gardens is a popular place for musicians and ducks. 

boa Park also hosts a number of 
playhouses. The foremost of these 
is the Old Globe Theater, a resi-
dent of San Diego since 1935. 

There are several productions 

currently running at the Old Globe, 
including the Shakespearean com-
edy "The Merry Wives of Wind-
sor" (through Oct. 9), "Collected 
Stories" (through Oct. 23), and 

"The Hostage" (through Oct. 30). 
So remember - there's a lot of 

new things to do and see in San 
Diego, but don' t miss one of its 
oldest attractions, Balboa Park.

Continued from .,..e B31 
and Grill sort of bring down the 
relaxed vibe. I love Open Bar, 
though." 

The atmosphere ca n be both 
good and bad. Because of the 
large number of bars, nightlife can 
get a little wild, which, coupled 
wi th the commute from UCSD, 
prevent some students from liv-
ing there. Visiting i another story. 

"The rela xed surfer atmos-

phere makes Pacific Beach a great 
place to visit," said Higgins. "It 
gives San Diego a place where 
college students can congregate 
to tudy or party, depending on 
what they need . You see students 
from UCSD, junior colleges, 'USD 
and SDSU. That's important for a 
healthy college experience. On 
the other hand, however, I don't 
know if I'd want to live here." 

Some students beg to differ. 
The nightlife and the party 
atmosphere can be a welcomed 
rest from the fast pace of UCSD's 
rigorous academic curriculum. 

"Living in PB is the best," said 
Marshall senior Samantha 

The UCSD Guardian 

Sevekow. "There are so many peo-
ple around all the time. Everyone 
is very friendly and says hello. 
Plus it's great having everything 
you could want just a few blocks 
away: the beach, shops, bars, 
restaurants. No matter what time 
of day it is there is always some-
thing to do. The coolest thing in 
PB is the boardwalk. I love to go 
rollerblading along the beach and 
check out the local scenery." 

PB is al 0 conveniently located 
near the beach that is ill the end of 
Garnet, near the famous hotel on 
the ocean, Crystal Pier. Here visi-
tors can stay in a room that is over 
the oceal), providing them with 

an excellent view of the sunset in 
the evening. Taking a left on to 
Mission puts visitors in Mission 
Beach, a different town that has an 
atmosphere similar to PB's, with a 
slightly more authentic feel. 

Pacific Beach offers convenient 
access to a II sorts of sports, 
smoke, smoke paraphernalia and 
body modification shops. Anyone 
looking for that just-right artist 
for a full body tattoo has come to 
the right spot. 

Simi larly, th re are a number

escape into " Bay-watch reality" 
can be relaxing away from the 
stark reality of the future that col-
lege presents.

La Jolla's beaches are treasures for students to take advantage of early and often

Hiatus Editor 

San Diego boasts several 
unique traits as a city but none 
are as spectacular as the many 
beaches and gorgeous overlooks 
that dot our portion of the Sou th-
ern California coastline. 

Whether visi tors are elbow-to-
elbow in sunbathers and barbe-
ques during the busy summer 
season or freezing their butts 
beneath a wet suit in the dead of 
winter, La Jolla's beaches consis-
tently deliver a good time. 
The Beaches 

It can seem as though there i 
more ocean, and and sunbathers 
clinging to the coast at La Jolla 
Shores during summer than any-
where else on earth. Particularly 
on Independence Day, when the 
capacity of the beach is fully test-
ed . 

As for the rest of the year, La 
Jolla Shores (loca ted just down 
the hill from UCSD and The 
Scripps Insti tute of Oceanogra-
phy) provides surfing, diving and 
kayaking opportunities nearly 
year-round . 

The La Jolla Cove is one of the 
few attractions in La Jolla that 
won't cost a fortune. This much 
tinier beach attracts the usual foot 
traffic, but really shines as an 
access point for snorkelers and 
scuba drivers to the La Jolla 
Underwater Park and Ecological 
Reserve. 

The rarely enforced ban on 
nude sunbathing at Black's 
Beach, along with its unique 
coastal topography (which 
occasionally produces some of 

pus. Attracting sunbathers, pic. 
nickers, surfers, swimmers and 
divers, La Jolla Shores has a little 
bit of something for everyone. 
Oespite the fact that its surf qual~ 
ty falls a little short in comparison 
to other beaches and the parking 
can be downright horrendous on 
peak days, La Jolla Shores 
remains the best beach in town. 

La Jolla Cove 
1180 Coast Blvd.

People have been visiting the 
cove in downtown La Jolla for 
close to 100 years. Excellent 
diving and sunbathing conditions 
abound at this historic spot. 

Black's Beach

221-8899 
The best spot for surfing and 
nude sunbathing merge in this 
fairly secluded beach. While 
some complain that the lack of 
a dress code makes the environ-
ment uncomfortable, others 
praise the waves, which are 
occasionally some of the best in 
the world .

In the Cove: The beaches of the La Jolla Cove have attracted hundreds of visitors every season for years. 

There aren 't many places where

the best waves in the world), 
consistently combine to make 
visits to this out-of-the-way 
beach an experience difficult to 
forget. 

The Overlooks . The Cliffs 
No UCSD student can last 

long in La Jolla without at least 
one visit to either the Cliffs or the 
Torrey Pines Glider Port, both 

within walking distance of cam-
pus. The two vistas are spectacu-
lar va ntage points of the coastline 
and can offer awe-inspiring views 
during sunset. 

A short walk from the UCSD 
campus will reveal spectacular 
views and, at the right time of 
day, dauling sunsets.

out of "Baywatch," features a 
relaxed beach, vacationing spot 
atmosphere. 

Located just south of UCSD, 
those venturing to PB can take the 
Balboa and Garnet exit off 1-5 
south. Heading right down Gar-
net, students will find a wide 
variety of retail shops - from 
used clothing stores like Buffalo 
Exchange and Aaardvarks to new 
clothing stores like The Atomic 
and L.A. Rack, there is a lot to 
offer. Nothing like the Gap or 
Express, these stores give people 
an opportunity to step out of the 
easy look and into something a 
little more funky. 

PB is also home to a lot of dif-
ferent restaurants, many of which 
provide good food at very reason-
able prices. Here, a number of 
authentic Mexican, Japanese, Chi-
nese, Indian, Hawaiian and 
Greek restaurants offer the public 
a taste of whatever it's in the 
mood for. 

For Japanese, UCSD graduate 
Koji Takahashi recommends PB 
Sushi Club near the Tiki lounge, 
Mr. Sushi, or Chopstix, bllt 
reports that the fish from Tokyo 
House is occasionaUy dry. Ichiban 
is also an excellent, well-known 
cafeteria-style restaurant that 
provides good sushi at very rea-
sonable prices. 

Da' Kines is an authentic 
Hawaiian restaurant that was 

c..- tID F-= Surfers race for the ocean in front of Crystal Pier, the only privately owned pier on the West Coast. 

recently featured in the San· Diego 
U"ion-Tribune Magazine, Night & 
Day. The menu features popular 
Hawaiian delicacies like kalua 
pig, Spam and eggs, Portuguese 
sausage and sweet tropical 
deserts. These dishes are appreci-
ated by even authentic Hawai-
ians. Da' Kines also has a restau-
rant in National City. For more 

information, call (858) 274-8494. 
For some, these popular restau-

rants are a part of a routine that 
they associate with the PB vibe. 

"Taco Surf is the epitome of 
the PB lifestyle," said Revelle 
senior Beth Amese. "The Mexican 
food is· great, and everyone is laid 
back and still sandy from the 
beach. My favorite thing to do on 

a Saturday afternoon is hang out 
on the beach and then go get a 
tostada grande." 

Because of the large number of 
swinging single students and col-
lege-age patrons, however, PB 
bars can be a little sleazy. 
Although some people enjoy the 
boisterous atmosphere, others are 
careful to stay away from the big-

ger ·bars like PB Bar and Grill 
because they are usually crowd-
ed. 

"Some places become a little 
too trendy and too similar to 
cheesy meat markets," said Rev-
elle senior Laura Higgins. "Places 
like Moon Doggies and PB Bar
