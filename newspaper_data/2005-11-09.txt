Famed prof talks 
race, sex, courts 
By MARNEIlE FEDERIS 

Senior Staff Writer 

Following President George W. 
Bush' recent nomination of Judge 
Samuel A Alito to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, many have raised concem 
about the funlre of the nation 's high-
e t court. 

In a UCSD lecture on ov. 3, 
Brandeis University law professor 
Anita Ilill addressed her concems 
about the Supreme Court and how 
gender has played an important role 
in the nominations. 

In 1991 , Hill came forward dur-
ing the confinnation hearings for 
then-Supreme Court nominee 
Clarence Thomas, accusi ng him 

of sexual harassment. Despite her 
claims, the Senate narrowly con-
fimled Thom~ls. . 

" In the last four years, we've real-
ly come to undersL'lI1d the impor-
tance of the Supreme Court and 
its relationship to the president," 
11ill said. "We nced to be looking 
for a cOurt that is not going to be 
rubber tamping the political agenda 
of the majority party in the nited 
States Congress or in the president's 
office." 

I lill also expressed her lUlcerrain-
ty with the president's latest nomina-
tion. She said that the possible pair-

----THE SRTV SHUTDOW 

Adlllin blocks return of SRTV 
By CHARLES NGUYEN 

News Editor 

Several university administra-
tors have rebuffed a request by A.S. 
President Christopher Sweeten and 
Commissioner of Student Services 
Maurice Junious to reactivate 
Student-Run Television, ca lling 
for more accountability on the part 
of the student govemmcnt. 

On ov. 7, Junious said he 
expected the sta tion to come back 
later that dav, after Sweeten and he 
had rcquest~d the reactivation. 

"It's in the administration 's 
hands now," Sweeten said after he 
filed his request. 

T he day after, the administra-
tion responded to . weeten, reject-
ing his request to put RTV bark 
on the air. 

"Please undersUind that the goal

Managers stuck in power struggle 
PROFILE 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
News Editor 

The storm had heen brew-
ing si nce the end of IJ~t year, 
but ndrew Tess and Tiffanv 
Rapp never expected it to get t~ 
when: they ~re i1(l\\ . 

As co-managers of Student-
Run Telc\·ision, the two h~\'e 
een their ~talion 's charter 

amended to bar sexua l forms 
of nudity the passage of a bill 
that banned John ,\!Iuir College 
se ni or teve York and his 
" Koala TV·' show from SRTV 
premises and the evennlal shut-
down of their entire station by 
the A.S . Council. 

Locked out of the place he 
has known for five years, Tess' 
feel ings extended beyond disap-
pointment. 

"The council is supposed 
to represent the students, and 
they're going to come to a rude 
awakening soon about what the 
students ~eally want, " he said. 
"The counci lmembers arc clos-
ing their cars not on ly to us 
but to the whole CSt) com-
mWlity. ' 

That lack of communication 
has left SRT managers, once 
the over eers of the channel 's 
programming, without a real 
function within the station , 
accordi ng to Rapp. 

"Right now, J don't feel like 
I have any real power," she said. 
"After all, I'm currently manag-

SRTV: Councilmembers 
decry lack of communication 

cunrll1ued from /Jage I 
Edward Spriggs on the topic, also 
told Sweeten he wanted "more 
confidence" in SRTV management 
before the signal was turned back 
on. 

"A.S. will need to providc the 
specifics to evoke that confidence," 
Rateliff sCHed. 

No specific standards were 
offered bv Ratcliff, Sweetcn said. 

The ~tation was shut off on 
ov. 3 during E.arl \-\farren ollege 

scnior Daniel \Varts' "unscheduled" 
;how featuring a political tall: with 
Jollll ,\hlir College Senior Steve 
York. After the show was Clit from 
the air, .S. \ 'ice President Finance 
Greg .\'Iurphy and Commissioner 
of Comlllwl il:ations Soap Chulll 
nrf,rued with SRTV staff llIembers. 

'I 'he signal came back on o\'. 
-l, bur was ag:tin shut off later that 
day. 

dlllini~trators told Sweeten 
that a physical altercation between 
council members and, RTV staffon 
No\,. 3 made the university legally 
liable, which gave them the right 
to keep the station offline, Sweeten 
said. In addition, administrators said 
that swtion members werc engag-
ing in illegl1l sc.'mal activities inside 
the Sfildio, Sweeten said. 

The admini tration's response 
to the reactivation request requires 
snadcnt unity on all sides, Sweeten 
said before a Nov. 8 SRl st'aff 
meeting. 

"If the entire campus, as stu-
dents, gets on one platfonn, it's 

Rehashing: Steve ,(ork explains his side. 
at a Revelle College Council meeting. 

going to get to administrators," he 
said a t the meeting. "They don't 
want bad pubLicity. If we're not 
together, shit's going to fall apart 
quick." 

The longer SRTV i inoperable, 
the more problems administrators 
arc making for themselves, said 
SRTV co-Manager Andrew Tess. 

"If the administration is stalling 
for whatever reason, they're going 
to be in more trouble than they 
already are," Tess said. "They arc 
not in a good position lega lly." 

Meanwhile, several A.S. scnators 
said they are frustrated with the 
lack of communication they have 
received from council executives 
since the station's shutdown. 

Muir Coll egc Council Chair 
eil Spears said he sent several e-

mails to Sweeten over the weekend 
inquiring why SRTV had been dis-
connected. However, there was no 
concrete response from Sweeten, 
leaving pears sti ll questioning 
what exactly had happened to the 
station. 

"I found out ju t from turning 
on SRTV over the weekend and 
seeing it was black," pears said. "1 
have no idea what is going on, and 
it's very frustrating. We deserve the 
right to know wh}' our serviee isn't 
operating." 

Any response by Sweeten at this 
point, however, would still be too 
late, pears said. 

Although Junious offered to 
address senators' concerns indi -
vidually, an official response thar 
could be sent to all councilmembers 
would be morc efficient, according 
to Revelle College Senjor Senator 
Rachel Corell. 

"We all need to know the same 
infonnation," she said. "Thursday 
night happened, and nobody told 
the cowlcil anything about it. I 
found out through second-hand 
ources. People ask me what's going 

on, and I can't tell them becausc, 
honestly, I don't 1000W." 

Corell invited Junious, Sweeten, 
York and Warts to a Revelle College 
Council meeting to address ques-
tions and explain the events that 
led ro the station's shutdown. Only 
WattS and York ancnded.

Managers: Tess to consider 
legal options in SR TV battle 

cominued frum page I council'~ sudden thirst for power, 
Rapp said. 

UC ducks line of fire on strict but 
legally hazy military recruiter law 

ing something that doesn't exi~t. 
They shut us down, and what\ 
frustrating to me is that the council 
is taking a lot of actions without a 
dialogue with us. the managers." 

That power ~trugglc with the 
council ultimately reached its 
boiling point ov. 3, when A.S. 
Commissioner of Student Services 
Maurice J unious requested via e-
m:! il tha t Tess presereen the mate-
rial to air that night. 

\\'hen the unscheduled show of 
Earl Warrell College senior Daniel 
\J arts- fe:lturinga political inter-
view with York - aired that night, 

.S. Vice President Financc Greg 
Murphy, acting as J unious' del -
ega te, ordered that the station be 
shut down. A rift between Junious 
and the SRTV managers has been 
widening ever since. 

"It's a lot harder for me to 
defend them this week," Junious 
said. "When I specifica ll y asked 
Andy to do somclhing, he did 
not. If everything had ran fluid 011 
Thursday, I would have had fi.,11 
confidence that SRTV was fint' . 
Andy had given me that assurance. 
But things weren't taken care of 
the way it should have been." 

WhileJunious did have ultimate 
authority over SRTV, granted by a 
bill passed by the council the previ-
ous day, he did not explicitly order 
anything of the managers. 

"In this situation, language is 
the most cruci~ll thing our therc," 
Tess said. "The wording here was 
'please prescreen any material.' 
Please is not an order and as a 
manager, I made a choice." 

Runnin g un scheduled shows 
has been a long-runnin g practice 
at SRTV, which reflects the free 
nature of the station, and the action 
taken agaillst a single instance of 
this practice is indicative of tile 

"This is definitely ,1 form of 
control," she said. ,,(t's <1 difficult 
sitll<ltion because, tech nically, we 
arc an A.S. service, but Iwe "rel a 

~ervicc to stlldents. I was expect-
ing admillisrrative involvement of 
al l things, but it's been a surprise 
how much they've gorren involved 
with running the station, and it's 
disappointing to have the council 
represent the students the way they 
have. But in the end, it's a lack 
of faith in managemenr and the 
people who run SRT ." 

Tess and Rapp have operated 
under a management style based 
on the principle of neutrality, irre-

~pective of t.he content of shows. 
They say they will continue to 
do so. 

"Persona ll y, I hate the KOlllfl 
and what it stands for," Rapp aid. 
"It's been a weird sinl3tion work-
ing with them, and it was a conflict 
I had before. But you accept it 
when you're part of a public space. 
You can't always hear things you 
like. It's not Tiffany's station. It's a 
station for tbe students." 

What the managers see as 
infringemcnt on student rights has 
made their "last resort" a realistic 
possibility: bringing the council 
to court. Tess, who has consult-
ed the Student Press Law Center 
from the beginning of the year on 
the st<1tion's rights, dubbt:d the 
council's decisions as a "big red 
button." 

"The counci l pur the big red 
button b'lCk there when they dis-
cussed amending our charter," he 
said. "Then they pushed it when 
they pulled the plug on us. So I'm 
heading down that legal path."

Contributing Writer 

niversity of California lawyer, 
have advised UC President Rohert 
C. Dynes that no change in uni -
versity policy is required in advance 
of next month's U.S. Supreme 
Court hearin1,'S on a law that allows 
U1C federal governmcnt to pluli~h 
universities for denying milit:1ry 
recruiters access to snadents. 

The Solomon mcncJmclH, 
which was decl~lred unconstitutional 
by tile 3rd Circuit Court of ppeal .. 
last Novcmber, requires the StLS-
pcnsiun of federal funcling for any 
institution that "prohibits, or in 
effect prevents" military recruiters 
frolll contacting students. I n addi -
tion, any instirution that refuses to 
release students' contact details and 
academic records to reeruitcrs can 
be penali7.cd. 

"Bccause the Court of Appeals' 
decision was stayed pending review 
by the U.S. Supreme Court, tile 
feeling was there was no reason to 
depart at tllis time from the unjver-
sity's long-standing policy pennit-
ting third-party reertliters access to 
the university's campuses providing 
they do not engage in employnlcnt 
practices thar are impcmlissiblc by 
law," 'aid Steven Rosen, a lawyer in 
the C Office of Ceneral Cowlsel. 

Ilowevcr, some view thc mili-
tary's "don't ask, don't tell" poLicy, 
which forbids the employment of 
openly gay recruits, as incompatible 
with the anti-diseriminatOry values 
held by Illany universitie '. 

"It's fuirly clear that the Solomon 
AmendmCllt forces universities to vi 0-
late their own commiol1ent to non-
discrimination or fucc rhe risk of Ios.~ 
of federal support," said Aaron BcLL.'in, 
director of the Center for the Study 

Law School Information Fair! 

of Sexual ,\1 inoriti<.'S in till ,\1 ali t:lr\' at 
C Sanm Barbara. "Plaling lIniv~rsi­

tics in tllat kind of double hind h:ls 
offended Illany people." 

The FOtliln for Academic and 
Institutional RighL'>, an umbrella 
group of 31 law ~chools t.hat origi-
nally brought U1C C3,e before the 
appeal, court, filed the case :1f,'l1in'it

"I t's a pedagogical choice to tcach 
the values of nondiscrimination ," 
AA P ()irectorofCommunit~lti ons 
Ruth Flowers said. 

Nonetheless, she said, until 
recently "most schools had accom-
modated both the wi hcs of the 
snadents and of the recruiters by 
offering access, but not the same 
access." 

Institutions such as I Larvard

Rosen acknowledged tll;u the 
university's campus ~stem makes it 
particularly vulnerable to ,anction 
under the amendment. 

"The government could argue 
th<lt an 'instirution of higher cdu-
cation' under tile relevant federal 
law extends to an entire univer-
sity system," he said. "In theory, the 
entirety of UC's research funding 
could be jCOP'lrdized by one campu.,

College eruor enator Kate 
Pillon's lersonal vendetta 
- shoul be acknowledged, 
several key issues threaten· 
not only the future of student 
speech but the legitimacy of 
the student government. 

Members of the A . 
Counci l ran for office to lead 
the suldent body. We could 
use some leadership right 
about now. 

A legal vacu um 
Even as cOUl1cilmembers 

rushed to r egulate media 
content, they have neither 
received nor sought ade-
quate legal advice. Since any 
monetary judgment result-
ing from a suit in the mat-
ter - which becomes more 
likely by the day - will like-
I)' be paid from our activity 
fees, students have rea on to 
be concerned. 

This year, the A.S. 
Council saw an unexpect-
ed windf:.lll of more than 

100,000; inexcusably, it has 
not lIsed a single penny of 
that money to hire an inde-
pendent attorney. Instead, 
our ~tudcnt leaders have 
relied on the univers ity' 
counsel, Daniel W: Park. . 

Since Park's job is to rep-
re<,ent the university admil 
Istrarioll - which lias takell 
a t1rm position on censor-
,>hip - any advice he hos 
offi.:red to the counci I is, at 
best, ~lI~pect and, at ,~orst, 
a hreach of legal ethic~. \ \ 'e 

suspect that if his dual role 
were made the subject of a 
complaint to the State Bar of 
Californja, Park would get a 
slap on the wrist. 

And it's clear that the 
advice given to the coun-
c il has been lacking. Men 
asked if RTV wa legally a 
"limited public forum " or a 
"nonpubLic forum," with the 
latter being the only way the 

.S. Council could r egulate 
content, our elected student 
leaders offered on I) blank

onstitutional dereliction 
In all democratic inslltu-

nons, trust in the rules mat-
ters. After all, the only way 
minority factions can accept 
the legitimacy of political 
losses is to believe in the 
fairness of the process. We 
no longer believe in the fair-
ness of the AS Council's 
parliamentary procedures 
nor in the ability of AS. Vice 
President Internal Angela 
Fomero to carry them out 
impartially. 

Several weeks ago, the 
council held an extraordi-
nary session, that complete-
ly disregard the mandatory 
procedures listed in its own 
constitution. Though at first 
Fomero admitted the error, 
proclaiming the meeting 
and the legislation passed 
therein to be "nuU and void ," 
she reversed herself just days 
later. 

By throwing constitution-
ality in the wind to favor a 
specific side in the debate 
over SRTV regulation, 
Fornero ha permanently 
shot her credibility a the 
honest broker of business in 
the legislative chamber. 

Students entrust the 
council with $1.5 million 
in activity fees. It is a del-
egation based on their belief 
in the ability of th e student 
government to represent 
their interests, and to do so 
in a manner fair to all s ides.

R ace riots are nothing new to America, but for France, they come as something of a surprise. Parts of some Paris suburbs have 
been burning for over a week, starting in C lichy-
sous-Bois and Aulnay-sous-Bois, and the riots have 
recently spread to more than 300 towns and cities, 
including Dijon , Stra bourg, ice and Marseilles, 
with the first fatality occurring on ov. 7 - a 61-
year-old man was beaten into a coma and then died 
in a hospital. This is the first eruption of popular 
frustration on the pan of French-
born chi ldren and grandchildren of 
immigrants who feel that discrimi-
nation against their skin color and 
religiuus affiliation has prevented " 

local businesses and over 1,400 cars. 
Residents of the violence-wracked areas cited 

high unemployment, discrimi nation , "heavy-handed 
polici ng" and poor housing as their main frustra-
tions. 

These are internal French problems, but we 
should be paying close attention. We shou ld also 
be payi ng attention to the recurring tensions in 
Denmark, Belgium and the etherlands, which 
spotlight the di fficu lties of a mostly homogenous 
continent coping with relatively recent growth of 
ethnica lly distinct immigrant populations and their 
first- and second-generation descendants. It also 

helps illustrate one aspect of the prob-
lems Europe is having with its growing 
Muslim minority.

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 9, Z005 THE OPINION S 

·A.nd so begins a new chapter of IAmerica's Finest City' 
Mayoral election sees the end of the beginning for San Diego 
lines in

Ian s. Port 

T hough it'll happen f.lr in the future, I call pictllre the pr()fes~or., now, ,cr:Hching

of this hook/article/lecture: 

Did the people of San Diego 
learn something in that rough ycar 
of 2005? Did all the ~elf-analvsis 
imposed by a citywide political 
upheaval actua ll y produce some 
change andlor good? 

As the climax of a long-stewing 
battle, the Nov. 8 special mayoral 
election wi ll be a fun chapter for 
the writers of San Diego's history. 
Though print deadlines dictate that 
thi s column be composed before 
the winner is declared, it's fun to 
imagine what gripping narratives 
could be superimposed over the 
too-real turbulence we'\'e expe-
ricnced this past yea r. ("The day 
SD went progressive," "Much ado 
about little change," "Voters still 
uninformed and apathetic," etc.) 

Il eipfully, the candidates ha\'e 
alre;ldy done this for LIS . In the d;IYs 
leading up to the election, both 
Donna Frye and Jerry Sanders 
h'lve declared themselves pnrt of 
the "new San Diego," hoping to 
write a little history in advance. 

Anything they come up with is 

probably sweeter than what will 
fill the pages up to this point. It 
seems hard to believe now, hut San 
Diegans were making thi same 
decision only a year ago, when \ 'ot-
ers chose then write-in candidate 
Frye over .\1 ayor Dick \1urph y,

"You a ren't ready for this yct." c 

.\1aybe we weren·t. Amid 
simmering legal cha ll enges to 
his "appointment," Murphy 
announced hi resignation last 
April. The sa me week in July that 
he aculally left the office, two city 
councilmembers (one of which was 
supposed to take over as acting 
mayor) were convicted of corrup-
tion for a few promises they made 
to a local strip club owner with 
lawmaking aspirations. 

Later that same month, the 
motley field of II w,lIlnabe San 
Diego mayor ' was uimmed down 
!O the pair sti ll foaming for the 
high chair as I write thi . 

nd as that year of resignations, 
convictions, investigations, law-

~uits and name-calling came full 
circle this wcek, the candidates of 
the future were se lling le~s-than­
'Icademic versions of the past that 
brought us to this sore spot. , 

Fomenting a class war in the 
old .Vlnrxist mold - labor versus 
capital - Frye and Sanders offered 
two casy, dam ning histories. To 

hear them tell it in the last debates, 
the pension crisis, the investiga-
tions, the corruption and the gen-
eral dvsfunction of the svstem are 
,.II due to the influence' of either 
the do" n\O\\n bU5ine~s/devcl()p­

of the past are JUSt convenient back-

to derive their oPPOnent's inferior-

strikingly simi lar: The unions ran 
the city or the bus inc smen and 
developers did - vote for the can-
didate free of specia l interests. 

But, uh, which one is that? 
Frye, whom anders ,Iccu~ed 

of being in Ihe pocket of the 
unions, has received over 200,000 
in friendly independent cxpendi-
rures from various labor groups.

And if Frye was, as Sanders 
likes to say, part of the problem at 
City llall, why did she alone votc 
against the rotten dea ls the minute

THE U SD UARDIAN WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 9,2005 

France: Riots highlight potential danger in Europe 
continued from /Xlge 4 

challenged by creeping Is lamic 
fu n(b menta lism. 

Ethnic Europeans have plen-
ty of their own complaints and 
fear, and not just about their 
burnt ca rs and husinesses. The 
Dutch Immigra ti on Minister, Ri ta 
Verdonk, described the problem 
concisely. "We t hought that every-
body who wanted to live in the 

etherlands would easily find his 
way arollnd Dutch society," she 
said to London's Dnily-Teleff'"npb 
bst May. "Now we have about 
700,000 people who have been 
he re for years but who don't speak 
the language or have a clue about 
our most b'lsic J-ules and values." 

The current viulence is not 
about religion . It" about young 
kids, living in poverty, who arc 
facing extremely high unemploy-
ment and the knowledge that they 
arc not co mpl etely welcome in 
their birth nations. But those con-
ditions are ripe for, and exacer-
bate, the fanatical religious exploi-
tation tha t is already taking place 
in Europe. 

Most European Muslims have 
no tics to terrorists, nor cou ld 
they be called Islami,ts. But that 
docs not change the fact that 
London wa~ bombed last July 
by Muslim fanatics, or that acts 
of anti-Semitism in France havc 
been growing. It does not chan ge 
the fact that there are Islamists 
~preacling throughout Europe 
who preach hatred of the West 
and a radical form of Islam that 
is incompatible with European 
social values. It does not change 
the fact that the Islamic fanatic 
who murdered Theo van Gogh 
just over a year ago expressed no 
remorse, but stood up in court 
and told van Gogh's mothcr, " I 
do not feel your pain," or the fact 
dlat some Muslims chcered when 
they passed the murder site in the 
days after. 

I t does not change the arson 
attacks against Dutch mosques 
that followed , or the Dutch and 
French politi c ians who have 
gai ned popularity by talking about 

barring non- ' '''estern immigrants, 
referring to dwm as "scum ," or 
ar resting I slami ~ , ts who have n't yet 
broken the law. It does not change 
thc fact that radIcal Tslamists often 
threaten with dClth the politicians 
who say such thi .. gs. Nor does it 
change the fact th~t the Sept. II 
hijackers were mostl, Europea n-
ed ucated men who fei r they did 
not fit into the world f)f their 
ethn ic homeland or the wvrld of 
a largely secular Europe, and who 
turncd to a radical form of Islam 
for meaning. 

It's hard not to see the young 
kids rioting in France as poten-
tial converts, and the really per-
verse thing is dlat such an attitude 
cou ld easi ly become a se lf-ful-

" The current violence is 
rwt about reUgion. It's 

about young kids, Uving 
in poverty, who are 

facing extremely high. 
unemployment and the 
knowledge that they are 
rwt completely welcome 
in their birth nations, " 

filling prophecy. "Many of thcse 
guys are no more Mu~lim than 
other French people arc prac-
ticing Christian," Christophe 
Bertossi of the French Institute 
of In tcrnational Relations told the 
11ltemationnl llemld-Tribul/e. "But 
if they arc given no other identity, 
the Muslim label risks becoming 
the thing they fall back on." 

If the war on terror is rcally 
a wa r of ideas, then Eu rope is 
onc of the main fronts in that 
war. and the riots in Prance are 
drawing attention to a lot of kids 

who seem ripe for exploitation by 
the other si de. Moderate Muslim 
leaders arc working to prevent 
that; some of them marched into 
the violence-torn areas alongside 
Catholic and Prorestant leaders to 
plead for ca lmn ess. But moderates 
often look like foo ls with their 
hands ov(!r their cars when placed 
alongside radical leaders who can 
point fingers at oppressors and 
offer a much easier answer than 
moderatts ever can. 

Europe ca n only win if it suc-
ceeds in making its new minorities 
into full y integrated citizens, not 
JUSt rab Muslims, but those of 

frica n desccn t as wcll, and tha t 
goal will require some give-and-
take from both sides. 

Govcrnments like that of 
France will most li kely have to 
settle for integration more in the 
style of Britain and tile nited 
States instead of the full assimi-
lation t hey want. They will a lso 
ha ve to serious ly evaluatc whether 
their r igid policies against reli-
gious wear in chools and against 
any kind of affirmative action 
- measures me,lIlt to promote 
assimilation - arc in fact alienat-
ing young citizens who attempt to 
find guod jobs .md identity with 
religion, and harl11ing (fUe inte-
gration. Other governments must 
try h>lfd - harder than they have 
heen - to make the economic 
opportunities of Europe a reality 
for minority citizens. 

Certain immigrant communi-
ties will have to recogni7.e th<lt 
they chose to live in countries with 
entirely differcnt stilndards of free 
speech and religious, gender and 
sexual equality, standard. which 
they are not free to violate under 
the guise of religio us expression. 
They wi ll most certainly have to 
recover from the dal11age to their 
reputations that the ongoing riot-
ing is causing. 

" It is a mutual thing," Verdonk 
said. "The native Dutch should 
give n~wcomers a fair chance 
and be open to them . But we are 
also convi nced that we ca n make 
dema nds of those coming here."

"Judge Alito :lnd Robem arc con-
servatives, and they will follow ,I 
philosophy that will protect the pres-
ident's authority and that will limit 
congrc siona l authority to extend 
individual rights," Ilill said. 

In light of the recent nomina-
tions, I Jill also spoke about the recem 
questions reg-drding dlC qualifica tions 
of Supreme Court justices. Because 
there are no official guidelines to 
measure credibility, a nominee's cre-
dentials can becomc important. f lill 
said that criticism of Bu h'5 injtial 
nomination of White 1·louse counsel 
Harriet Miers, which eventually led 
to her withdrawing, was e!oSentially 
driven by sexism and elitism. 

"Many of her erities said thaI 
[MiersJ lacked intellectual heft to 
deal with the issues of constitutional 
law that are likely to come before the 
court," Hill said'. " In tcnn of intcl-
lecwal heft, those a re the kinds of 
questions that are raised very often 
when you have a woman candidate 
or a aUldidate of color." 

Even the way Miers was present-
ed to the public was vety different 
from the president's presentation of 
RobertS and Alita, according to Il ili. 
Hill said that while the president 
ta lked about the long list of crcden-
tials the other two had dllring his 
nomination annOWlccmcnts, Nliers

was only described as having served 
the president for tile past five ycars 
as his chief COlUlSCI. 

"In that scnse, he constricted 
her entire ea rcer in the !past] five 
\'cars," Ilill ~aid. "This reflects the 
jlrcsident's \ cry narrow view of what 
qualifications are, as well as ;l very 
narrow ,;cw of what women 's an~1 
minoritics' qualifications should be." 

Thosc who ,mended the lecture 
said that Ilill hrought up aspects of 
the nomination process that they had 
never thought about. 

" I thought that she was <Ibsolutcly 
right in [poi nting out] the way Miers 
was brought forth as opposed to 
the other candidates," said ShaUll 
Couglin, a graduatc sUldent at the 
School for International Relations 
and Pacific Studies. "It looked to mc 
like it was more of a qucstion of her 
juclicial expcrience, whereas profes-
sor I I i II drew on a gender basis." 

The gender issue was a impor-
tant topic to cover, according to 
Emelyn De La Pena, director of the 
Women's Center. 

"I was really glad she pointed 
out a few of the thi.ngs people don't 
think about !reg-drding! the nomina-
tion process," she said. "Women <lre 
overlooked not only for reasons that 
are obvious but also because they 
might not have had the same oppor-
tunities that some men had." 

Because it is up to individual sen-
ators to define what Imlkes a good 
Supreme Court justice, they arc more 
likely to look at a nominee's ideology 
as a "Iinnus test," 1 [ill said. 

Judicial philosophies, whether 

they will have a more strict interpre-
tation of the constitution or be judi-
cia l ;'acti\~sts," will play an important 
role in the confinnation process, Ilill 
aid. 

"The judicial activists havc been 
made the enemy, bUI only the judi-
cial acti\~'it:s that act in ,I reas that 
extend rights, " Ilill !>aid. 

Thurgood ,\1 arshall College 
freshman Mark Galvan said that 
J liII 's lecture !{<I\'e him a new \~ew of 
the judicial sy;tel11. 

"It was interesting to sec other 
IJCP.>l>cctives to give -me an under-
standing of how the world works and 
how American politics arc shalJCd 
around issues like gender," Galvan 
said. 

Othcr swdents who attended 
the lecture agreed that Ilill 's gender 
analysis was an important one. 

"I thought it was interesting how 
she was able to connect through 
political lines, through gender, to 
analyze why Miers was trcated the 
way she was," Eleanor Roo evelt 
College senior Shannon Davenport 
said. "[I 1 ill's] points arc valid. That 
language i important, and we do 
have to pay morc attention to how 
lanl,ruage is used to promote c~rtain 
ideas." 

The evcnt was ponsored by the 
Women's Center as part of a series 
of activities to celebrate its 10-year 
anniversary. Approximately 900 
administrators, students and com-
munity mcmbers attended.

Offbeat film director preaches 
about meditation and movies 
By OAKLEY ANDERSON-

MOORE 
Senior Staff Writer 

A II who came to sec David Lynch at Price Center on Nov. 4 got a glimpse into the head of the 
man who gave us "Eraserhcad" and 
now, the David Lynch Fowldation 
for Consciousnes Based Education 
and World Peace, rooted in tran-
scendental meditation. 

"Transcendenta l meditation is a 
mental tech.nique that allows any 
human being to dive within subtler 
levels of mind and intellect and 
transcend, experiencing pure con-
sciousness," Lynch said. "You grow 
in bliss, intelligence and love." 

Lynch, along with Dr. John 
I Jagelin and Dr. Fred Travis, was 
meant to explain the fac ts behind 
transcendental meditation and 
encourage students to apply fo r 
scholarships to srudy it. There 
is something sort of sweet (albeit 
strange) about Lynch's quest to 
get students to increa e academ-
ic achievemcnt and relieve stress, 
deprcssion and leaming disorders

of transcendental meditation) tcch -

Passionate acting and directing pump 
life into Lorca's classic 'Blood Wedding' 

By OAKLEY ANDERSON-MOORE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Blood Wedding" is not some kind of teenage slasher film , as the title might lead one to believe, but a play about 
passionate love so doomed that in every 
page of the script the images of death lurk 
forebodingly, It was written by none other 
than Federico Garcia Lorca - possibly the 
greatest contemporary Spanish playwright 
- four years before he was executed and 
thrown into an unmarked grave at th e 
orders of the Franco Regime. 

In a medium with many creative forces 
working toward one end product, the star of 
thi production is without a doubt the direc-
tor: second year master of nne arts student 
Gerardo)o e Ruiz.. True to his emphasis on 
Spanish and Latin American work, Ruiz has 
come out with a bold directorial vision in his 
first departmental graduate production at 
UCSD. He takes Lorca's original poetic pia), 
(translated in this adaptation by Langston 
llughes) and transforms the musical text 
into words that dance out into the audience 
through th e vessel of the acrors ' songs and 
the musi(.'a l accompaniment of guitar and 
violin (Ruiz is credited as a composer). To 
read the play is one thing, bur to sec and hea r 
tllC lyricism in such a palpable renditi on is tile 
only way to do justice to Lorca's work. 

Jennifer .hang, in her last year of the 
UCSD MFA acting program, shows ber 
growth through the mature perfornla ncc of 
Lorca's elega ntly grieved Mother. Onstage a 
figure of fres h youth, Chang gradu all y takes 
us in with her rendi lion of an aged II oman 
who has seen the blood of her husba nd and 

children spilled before her. Throughout the 
play, she speaks of her wish to scream out at 
her sadness, but does not. But when her last 
son i brought back lifeless to a tomb, she 
does finally scream - not excessively, not 
hysterically, but with a genuine torment that 
Chang earns from the audience, express-
ing all the pain of a woman robbed of the 
dreams of her life. 

The counterpoints to Chang'S perfor-
mance are A.K. Murtadha and Teri Reeves, 
who play the forbidden lovers Leonardo and 
the Bride. The bodies of the two hopelessly 
bowld yet unconsummated youths seem to 
have invisible strings puUing them togeth-
er whenever they appear on stage, whether 
together or not. The audience is left with a 
feeling of torment: wishing for both of them 
to fall naturally into each other's amlS, but 
resting uneasily with the imminent death and 
sorrow that this embrace would bring. 

The most wonderful and chilling scene 
occurs as the lovers are on the run in the for-
est, and a fervent beggar (Quonta Beasley) 
who symbolizes the force of death, asks the 
moon (Mark Emerson, who plays multiple 
cha r-dcters) to light the sky so the lovers will 
be caught. As the stage fills with blue-white 
light, we hear the unnerving instrumentals 
pla)ri ng not ongs, but selected sounds - a 
bow rwIDing across the violin, a string plucked 
on the guitar - that make us shiver in despair 
for the twO lovers caught under the exposing 
rays of the moon. 

. Don't be dissuaded by the title - no 
slasher film could evoke the gri pping p:m ion 
and bone-chill ing doom in this pby.

so sweet about that? 

Believe it or not, there is ome-
thing pretty sweet behjnd it all; 
at the end, after a little visit from 
G lenda the good witch, the main 
character goes back to his girlfriend 
in o rder to pursue true love. Hea r 
that? T he end message is love: 
sweet, romantic, hot-sex-scene 
love! Which, cven if you can 't jibe 
with the same optimism, is pretty 
sweet. 

"Wi th regular practice it grows

see a girl who starts to meditate, 
and in about two years you see a 
beauty that is profound. Love is 
radiating from her, and this person 
has become so beautifu l, it's kind

O ios (l11aI05) suffers from multiple persoll<ll-ity disorder. The bands newest relcase blends various SOlUlds from the old, such as 
classic rock, to the new, such as pop ballads, into 
a musical brew. The album generates a vague 
sensc of deja vu, probably because it's a throw-
back to the days of Brian Wils n and the Beach 
Boys, with a recurring dnlg abuse theme just to 
make it more relevant to today's gcncmtion. 

The borrowed assortment of melodies and 
musical instruments, while exotic and Aavorful 
by thcmselves, become generic when cmmmcd 
together onto one album. -nle songs arc not 
quite pop, rock or even folk. _I 'he lyrics are 
pleasant, but repetitive. Vocnlist Joel Morales 
is proficient bur not memorable. The band 

*** 
members arc so focused on mlxing other stylcs 
of music that they forget to add their own dis-
tinctive label. "Tokyo Sunrise," with its hunlOr-

Exceptional Iytics, commanding intclligcllcc ~Uld ,ki ll at the game of chcss earned GJI..A the nickname "the Genius." Joined hI'

GrmU(lIIf1J1m', the two ha"e brought these cle-

[r's not casy to stand our in a crew of nine 
t::Jlcntcd NICs, but C;7..A illlmediately emerged 
as the m t ttlcnted ,\tiC in the Wu-'11tng Clan. 
GZAS lyrical versatility is evident on every track 
here, particularly on "Queen!; G.:tmbit," which 
continues the chess motif whilc tclling a story 
of an "A-list actress," maintaining a dlcme of 
football references a la "Labels" or "Fame" 
from his previous albwllS. Sounds bi7.arre, but it 
works. For those looking for some classic \,vu-

and "Unstoppable -I'hreats" will S3tiSty any Wu

and Masca Killa . 

Whilc G'TmdIJlIISlI'Y has all dle pieces in 
place, it hIlls JUSt short of being a classic Wu 
release. Most of Muggs' modest prtxluction is 
dIe perfC<.1: backrlrop for GZ " abilities, but 
o,·cl1>roduced tracks make it actually secm as 
though the twO are opposed [0 each other, as the 
title implies. When on the same page, though, 
the result is some of dlc bcst ovemll hip-hop of 
the year.

WEDNESDAY. NOVEMBER 9. 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS I l 

Twisted savants of the bizarre convert to the church of Rock 'n' Roll I Bang Bang: 
By IAN S. PORT 
Senior Staff Writer 

Despite their well-earned reputation as dar-lings of the weirdest kind of weird-rock, the members of Decrhoof do not have 
their heads so far up their 3nsy-fartholes that 
they can't appreciate the beautiful power of 
basic, stupid rock music. It's actually a mess-
up on the part of too-humble listeners to 
assume that the band thought their allegedly 
obtuse destructo-drum freakours and guitar 
noise flourishes were anything but basic, stu-
pid rock music in the first place . 

Tile RlIml/'1"j F OIII' is simply notice that 
Deerhoof have realized their musical nir-
vana. (The Decrhoof Sutra will read "After a 
tenure in the pcrspectiveless desert of jerky, 
avant-rock extremism, the once- flippant tOne-
mischiefs then formally descendcd to the 
Fundamental Rock 'n ' Roll Level, shortening 
all songs lllld making them rock harder than 
hard rock ever rocked . And thus insecure 
headphon e monks never ques tioned their dis-
sonant early work again, but saw in it the 
seeds of this truly profound doculllent.") 

Sccond track "' Iwin Killers" will sell you 
better than religion: two minutes and 16 scc-
onds of r:lW, riff-driven perfection that (honest-
ly) tosses out anything the Rolling Stones have 
sold as "music" for the last 20 years. About half 
of the 20 songs on Tile Rmme13' Fom' rock like 
"Killers"; "0 Malley, Fonner Underdog" tOsses

out classic chord progressions one after another 
for a neck-snapping two-mi.nute joy overdosc; 
and the dirty gristle of "Wrong Time Capsule" 
defeats most of the remnants of '90s alt-rock still 
languishing on tile playlisrs of corpo[""dte-owncd 
shit stations. 

The newish, easy songs are mixed in with the 
hard and crazy old ones; third track" RWlning 
Thoughts" follows a rough-hewn but discem-
ible spazz-pop road for two minutes, then takes 
off on some interstellar spacewalk as drum-
mcrlbandleader Greg Saunier shows how he 
can jazz with a kit. The production is rough 
all around - like only poorboys can do - and 
you're supposed to find that charming, dam-
nit. (Nevcr mind that it disguises some of the 
chi ldish jubilance of this rock/pop record .

some weird-heat, you'll h3te every other track 
on The Rumm"j F01l1' - from "Odyssey," with 
slow male vocals dre'lining obscurely over flat 
strulllming; to "Scream Team," a bre\!zy tl:cn 
jaunt that ends in a bruising, distorted-guitar 
hammerdown. 

Remember, it's supposcd to be silly. li ow

balls-out rock strutter ought to be? Or dle frcak-

song titles like "Midnight Bicycle Mystery" and 
"Rrrrrrright"?

H~tch: Team chemistry better than last year 
COmintled from page 16 

tions about himself, the team ruld 
the upcoming season. 

GrunWan: In a typical week, how 
much time do you devote to bas-
ketball? 
Hatch: I'd say about four hours a 
day, so 20-25 hours a week. That's 
about three and a half hours prac-
ticing, give or take an hour Lifting 
weighrs. 

G: What is a coach Bill CarT 
practice like? 
H: Coach Carr practice start with 
defensive drills, breakdown drills, 
shooting, guards on one side, big 
men on the other side. Defensive 
drills again, go through the plays 
for about another 30 minute , and 
then you end with everyone on the 
Line running. 

G: So the emphasis in training is 
primarily on defense? 
H: Yeah. We've always been more 
focused on defense, but even more 
so this year, because we're a lot big-
ger thi year and we realize we can 
stop people on defense. 

G: Have you found it difficult to 
balance grades, basketball and 
the social life a UCSD student 
so desires? 
H: ot really, considering this is 
how it was in high school. You just 
have to come in with the mentality 

of school first, basketball second. 
During the season, you don't really 
have much of a social atmosphere 
anyway. It's pretty easy. Just gotta 
find time to study when you can. Do 
the best you can. 

G: What is YOW' greatest strength 
on the basketball court? 
H: I think my leadership qualities 
and bringing down the ball and 
telling people where to go. As a 
point guard, you've got to mow 
everyone's position on the court, so 
even if I never play [center], which 
I never will, I've got to mow where 
everyone will be. 

G: Which area needs the most 
improvement? 
H: I think my offensive intensity. 
Sometimes I get into the leadership 
qualities of telling everyone else 
what they need to do, but I forget 
what 1 need to do myself and when 
J can take it to the basket and get 
points easily. I tend not to do that. 
But I'm focusing on that more this 
year. 

G: You were a team captain 
last year. Was there a specific 
moment you remember stepping 
up to become a leader? How 
were you able to assert yourself 
as a freshman? 
H: I think that moment came dur-
ing the 61th game against Chapman. 
I remember coach saying, 'Andrew, 

just go to the ba keto Forget the 
plays, just go to the basket. ' I just 
told everyone, spread out, I'm going 
to the basket, nobody is going to 
stop me here. I think that is when 
I really became the captain of the 
team. This year, we really haven't 
established who's captain, but it's 
just going to be who can step up in 
the game and show they have the 
leadership qualities. 

G: What is your leadership style? 
H: Lead by example. I'm going to 
go out there and do my best, and 
hopefully everyone else will too. 

ot necessarily yelling at people, 
because that doesn't seem to work. 
JUSt go out there, play hard , and 
hopefully people will follow you. 

G: The team enters the season 
with seven returning players and 
an incredible nine newcomers. 
How is team chemistry so far? 
H: You mow what, it's a lot better 
than last year. Off the court we get 
along better, we hang out twice 
a week together, which we never 
did last year. Last year, we kind of 
had a division in the team with the 
younger guys and the older guys. 
This year everyone is more together 
and we're very team-oriellted and 
we just seem to like each other a 
lot more. 

Look for rbe ,·est of Joe's interview 
witb Hatch ill tbe next ;SS1IC. 

Football: Look to Trojans for inspiration 
continued from page 16 

we need to begin with a football 
team. 

It wouldn't matter if the Triton 
football team started out sma ll. It 
wouldn't even matter if we had 
a losing team. Truth is, UCSD 
students just need someone to 
root for or some event to attend 
on the weekends. It's funny to 
think that homecoming began as 
a college tradition - to every 
student on campus, homecoming 
is just a memory of high school 

glory days. 
Don't get me wTong, UCSD 

has some awesome sportS teams 
already - mad props to the water 
polo team for being so amaz-
ing despite a lack of scholarships 
- but there's nothing like a good 
football game on a weekend 
afternoon. Sure we'd start off as 
underdogs, but look at UC Davis 
this season: They may not be on 
the top of the league, but small 
victories like the big upset over 
Stanford keep their team alive and 

give the Aggies' fans something to 
talk about for year to come. 

Forget the running joke of our 
"ulldefeated" football team - it's 
time to break a few rules and 
begin making our own history 
and traditions. 0 more rumors 
about a football tcam being in the 
works - give students something 
to roOt for in our everyday doom 
and gloom lives of midterms, and 
maybe UCSD won't look like a 
ghost town on the weekcnds. It 
could be a real college campus.

Dickey's MVP year leads Tritons 
Midfielder tallied 13 goals, nine assists in 2005 

By ANGIE UN 
Associate Sports Editor 

In her third year as a Triton, 
Meg-an Dickey capped off a near-
perfect season for the UC D wom-
en's soccer team by bringing home 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association's Most Valuable Player 
award. Beating out many other 
star CCAA athletes, the San Diego 
native led the Tritons with 33 
poin ts, stemming from 13 goals 
and nine assists during the team's 
victorious run at the CCAA crown. 

Dickey, who was also named to 
the AII-CCAA First Team, scored 
two game-winning goa ls during the 
season: the first in the Tritons' vic-
tory over Cal tate Dominguez 
I Ii lis on ept. 21; the second at the 
CCAA semifinals on ov. 4 against 
Chico tate, in which Dickey scored 
the g-ame-winning goal 55 mi nutes 
and five seconds into play. 

"Going into each game, I am 
just looking to play and enjoy 
my elf," Dickey said. "I do get ner-
vous at times and there are games 
that I walk away from disappointed 
in my performance, but that i part 
of the g'ame." 

ince the age of five, Dickey 
has played soccer in the San Diego 
.lrea, including 12 years on the Surt 
. occer Club and four years on the 
Torrey Pines I ligh School team. 
Dickey didn't have to travel far 
from home to add collegiate soccer 
to her repenoire. 

Dickey attributt.'S much of her 
success to the trong support from 
her teammates and coaches. 

"[ have had a lot of great encour-
agement from the coaching staff 
and our entire team is supportive 
of each other," Dickey said. "The 
thing about our team is that there 

i~ no one person tha t scores a LI the 
goals or is that much better than 
the next girl. We all playa big role 
in each other's success and every 
!,'1ll11e is different for everyone." 

Coming off a mediocre season 
last year, in whi h the ladies were 
~nubbed from the CM playoffs 
- the first time since 19 2 - the 
Triton had much to prove this

Owens makes Niners look 
like smartest team in NFL 
Philly wishes 'T.O.' stayed in S.E after 
latest comments lead to his suspension 

The Sports 
Retort 

Rael Enteen 

T he San Francisco 4gers were once a storied footbaU franchise with five shining 
Vmce Lombardi trophies in their 
collection. Since the late I 990s, 
however, the 4gers ownership has 
made numerous unintelligent deci-
sions, transforming their dynasty 
into the laughingstock of the league. 
However, despite aLI the criticism 
the ~gers deserve for their fai lures, 
they did one thing right: T hey trad-
ed ' Ierrell Owens to the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 

oW "TO." is Philadelphia 's 
problem; but he won't be for long, 
since he won't suit up for the Eagles 
again this year and will most likely 
be traded to whoever will take an 
overpaid, arrogant playmaker as 
oon a the season is over. But until 

they find an owner dumb enough to 
allow Owens in his locker room, the 
Eagles are flying through a torm 
of epic proportions. The 2004-05 
Eagles era will be known as a soap 
opera that starred Owens, but got 
canceled after two seasons. 

The oap opera took a tum for 
the worse a week ago when Owens 
once again ignored the very clear 
boundary his team set for him while 
talking to the media. In an -interview 
with ESPN, Owens whined about 
his organization's lack of praise for 
him, then moved on to his favor-
ite pastime of bashing Donovan 
McNabb, saying the Eagles would 
be better off with Brett Favre under 
center. 

Although most are shocked by 
Owens' new rant, anyone with any 
knowledge of his past should have 
seen this coming. When with the 

iners, Owens criticized his quaner-
back and coaches in the same fashion. 
In September of 2003, Owens ver-
bally attacked 4gers offensive coor-
dinator Greg Knapp on the sideline 

of a nationally televised game and in 
August 2004, Owens questioned for-
mer 4gers quarterback Jeff Garcia's 
sexual orientation. 

This all led to Owens' offseason 
trade to the Eagles, who must now 
regret their decision to welcome 
Owens into the City of Brotherly 
Love. However, despite the Eagles' 
mistake, by suspending Owens for 
four games and then deactivating 
him for the rest of the year was the 
right course of action. 

They have no other options. 
Owens's playmaking ability does not 
make up for the damage he does 
to a team's morale. Owens came 
to Philadelphia - a team that had 
three-straight NFC Championship 
appearances - and turned them 
into a last-place team wi thin two 
years because of his antics. lie 
forced his Pro-Bowl quarterback to 
tell the team to pick sides because 
McNabb felt his team was splitting 
and needed to know where loyalties 
belonged. Many call him a "club-
house cancer," a fitting title for a 
man who can take a healthy winning 
tealll and, by running his mouth, 
convert it into a decaying loser. 

ow, the question of the week 
is "Where wi ll Owens go next?" 
T he Eagles seem like they want 
nothing more of Owens, leaving 
the rest of the league's owners to 
debate whether they would allow the 
receiver near their own quarterback. 
J t is an interesting debate because, 
in tum, you get a guy who had 124 
receptions for 1,963 yards and 20 
touchdowns in his one-and-a-ha1f 
seasons in Philly. 

Chances are, there will be a team 
desperate enough to talke in one of 
the best receivers of all time despite 
his busload of Louis Vuitton bag-
gage. And, unless by some miracle, 
Owens stops whining and becomes 
best friends with his next quarter-
back, it is fair to expect another soap 
opera next year with a new team. 

And in a year, when the drama 
continues, the 4gers and the Eagles 
wi ll be laughing, wondering when 
teams wi ll start leaming and giving 
up on the best soap opera star this 
world has ever seen.
