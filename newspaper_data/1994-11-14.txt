TRIKES: 
New Center 
To Launch 
UCSD into 
Info Age THE 

MUGGING 
ER EDUCATION? 

CENTER: Engineering and 
computer science will design 
innovative wireless products 
By Mary Beth Sedlack 
Staff Writer 

THE COST OF CALIFORNIA'S NEW 
CRIME MEASURES MAY BE THE STATE'S 
ONCE-VAUNTED UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS 

UCSD will be better equipped for the "infor-
mation age" when the Center of Wireless Com-
munications opens next year. 

The center, which will primarily be under 
the umbrella of electrical engineering and com-
puter science programs, will research and de-
velop innovative wireless products. 

C alifornia voters overwhelmingly approved the "Three Strikes" 
initiative last week, hoping that the tough 
provisions will send a message to career 
criminals that crime does not pay. 

But when the smoke from Tuesday's 
election clears and thousands of AeW-
criminals fill ever-growing prisons, crit-
ics contend that California's once-
vaunted system of higher education may 
be left to pick up the bill. 

"We expect the center will establish UC San 
Diego as one of the top research and educational 
facilities anywhere for wireless communica-
tion," said School of Engineering Dean Robert 
Conn. 

The center will receive the majority of its 
support through membership fees from the com-
munications industry. Currently, eight compa-
nies have signed on to become full or associate 
members of the center: Noika, Fuji Electronics, 
TRW-MEAD, Hughes Network Systems, PCSI, 
Martin Marietta, Coded Communications, and 
QUALCOMM. 

Policy analysts and think~tanks have 
been quietly warning the public that the 
massive expenditure required to enforce 
the popular crime measure may quickly 
deplete the state's ability to fund higher 
education. 

Mer only a few years of enforce-
ment, there may be no money left for the 
University of California or California 
State University systems, both of which 
are already reeling from five years of 
tight budgets. 

MEventual1y w. 
Just run out of 
money for hI .... r 
education, .... 
It's In the near 
futur •• " 

These firms have a vested interest in the field 
of wireless communications. Noika is the sec-
ond largest manufacturer of cellular phones in 
the world and has a branch office in San Diego. 
QUALCOMM, also head-quartered in San Di-
ego, is an international leader in digital wireless 
communications systems and products based on 
proprietary technology. 

Full members, such as Noika, will be repre-
sented on the center's board and will help guide 
researcb. They will also be offered the first 
rights to patents resulting from the center's 
research. After a first right of refusal has been 
offered to full members, rights to patents will 
then be made available to associate members.

M~ir .College Council 
Bans Smoking 
RESOwnON: Council members limit smoking in 
Muir quad seating area amid concern of backlash 
By HIM Iouahton 
Staff Writer 

The Muir College Council 
(MCC) passed a resolution which 
will ban smoking at the Muir quad 
seating area last Monday. 

According to the resolution, the 
Muir quad seating area refers to "the 
movable tables located in the Muir 
quad in front of and 
onthesideofM.O.M. 
[Middle of Muir), the 
steps in front of and 
on thesideofM.O.M. 
and the cement seat-
ing area surrounding 
the tree located in 
front of M.O.M." 

Moskovic:s disagreed,saying that 
the MCC governs Muir and is an 
appropriate body 10 eDlUre univer-
sity policy is enforced. He said that 
Housing and Dining Services will 
provide the "no smoking" sign and 
set it up each day. 

MCC Program Board Represen-
tative Mike Herbst added that even 

though the univer-
sity hu not en-
forced the policy, 
Muir has the re-
sponsibility to en-
force it. 

MCC Commuter 
Council Representa-
tive Stuart Moskovics 
said he wrote the reso-
lution because he is 
concerned about the 
detrimental effects of 
smoking and second-
hand smoke on Muir 

• MWhentaklq 

Several coun-
cil members 
voiced concerned 
about possible dis-
sidence from Muir 
residents. Droubi 
said that she won-
dered how long 
the bans would 
continue to be en-
forced.

away from that 
smoke," Moskovics 
said. 

Moskovics added that accordin.g 
10 'he UCSD Policy and Procedure 
Manual, outdoor seating located ad-
jacent to an indoor eating facility 
must have designated and posted 
non-smoking areas. Moskovicssays 
that Muir is not acting in accordance 
with university policy and must com-
ply, which includes posting a sign 
which displays the smoking ban in 
the area. 

However, Muir House Advisor 
Tamara Droubi said she does not 
see the need for the MCC smoking 
ban. 

"[The university I has a policy 
there and in effect .... This policy is 
redundant. The fact we have no 
signs, the chancellor should deal 
with," Droubi said. 

-T ...... DIoubi said. 
MuirColIege Moskovics 

said that he is not 
forcing students to quit smoking. 
but to stop smoking in designated 
areas al Muir. 

"Once your individual right starts 
infringing on other people's rights, 
then it's not your right anymore," 
Moskovics said 

Muir House Advisor Leigh 
Schroeder said that she uks people 
to stop smoking when it bothers her, 
and therefore does not see the ne-
cessity of the smoking ban. MCC 
member Benjamin Katz said the 
resolution wu needed so that stu-
dents would feel comfortable and 
empowered to uk people to stop 
smoking. 

According to the Mcc, smoking 
is still allowed on the grass in the 
Muir quad lrea and at the tables near 
the Halfdome Lounge.

BILL CUNTON HAS MAOI! A OOMEBACK 
in foreign policy, or so he would like the 
American public to think. While the presi-

semi-successful endeavors into H.iti and 
the Persian Gulf, he has yet to accomplish 

anything worthy of praise.

those who opposed their regime. 
And th~situation in Haiti is far from settled. 
Our troops are still there, protecting the 
newly reinstated govemment against po-
tentially violent uprisings, which costs the 
United States even more money. Despite 
Aristide's return, democracy has not been 
restored, and it is not clear how U.S. inter-
ests were served in this venture. 

As for the Persian Gulf, Ihe precedent 
had already been set by former President 

George 
Bush. While

Clinton made the right decision by quickly 
sending troops to the Gulflast month, wIleD 
Iraqi troops massed at the Kuwaiti border, 
it wu by no means an act of foreign-policy 

that it would not build any 
nuclear weapons. ADd aa:ordina to its agree-
ment with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), it mUlt provide an inven-
tory of its plutonium production and allow 
the U.N. to insPect its nuclear sites. How-

genius. Any president would

to Japan shortly after his

plan for improving eco-

weak threats, which did 
nothing to encourage Japan 
to make any concessiona to 
improve trade relations with 
the United States. 

Most prominently, 
Clinton caved in when a real

arose in North Korea. After

by the United States. Clearly, North 
Korea wa the winner in this "com-
promise." 

, The consequences of the "com-
promise" include the precedent it 
sets for future negotiations. North 
Korea now realizes that if it simply 
stands firm with the United Ststes, it 
will get what it wants. This also

sends a message to countries which 
are working to produce nuclear 
weapons, such as Iran. These coun-
tries .Cln simply follow North 
Korea's footsteps. They see how 
easily the United States backs down, 
even when dealing with a. country 
which has deliberately violated its 
treaties and agreements. 

Neither the United States nor 
U.N. should have compromised on 
the issue. Indeed, much ofthe blame 

caffeinetically challenged. 
Coffee has its own image and 

culture. American business would 
obvioualy come to altandstill in the 
event oCa coffee lhortage. Employ-
ees stagger into work end ICOwl at 
each other before making a beeline 
to the employee lounge for their 
morning dosage. 

At meetings, coffee is a given. 
AlthOugh my coworkers didn't seem 
to mind the foul instant coffee which 
our hosts would serve us, I could 
only force a cup down with diffi-
culty. Once the host of. meeting 
asked if we'd like ooffee or, thought-
fully, "tea or hot chocolate?- I hap-
pily ordered hot cocoa, and my boss 
looked at me in horror. I see his 
point: Drinking hot chocolate con-
jures up images of jammies and bed-
time stories whicb somehow don't 
fit witb the power suit and briefcase 
crowd of a Silicon Valley price ne-
gotiation. 

Outside of business, especially 
st universities, coffee baa an intel-
lectual, classy image. Coffee drink-

fortheentire issue falls on the U.N., 
because it failed to deal with the 
problem early and instead left it to 
the United States. Given North 
Korea's violations of its treadies 
and the delicate nature of the situa-
tion, Ointon 's weak stance is com-
pletely unacceptable. 

Why did Clinton stand finn with 
Haiti and Iraq, but back down from 
North Korea? He did it because he 
saw an easy invasion in Haiti, a 

ers dwell ib dark cafes, surrounded 
by twecd-clad intellectuals engaged 
in animated debates. They sit at 
round marble tables upon wbich are 
scattered piles of books whose titles 
contain liberal IUICS of the words 
"paradigm," "deconstruction. - and 
"neo-Realism." Who would defile 
this scene witb a 7-Up? 

Unfortunately, I would. My caf-
feine intake is so low that a cup of 
coffee will sufficiently alarm my 
system to keep me awake for ap-
proximately 36 houn. Were I to 
drink a double espresso tomorrow, 
I'd still be awake for finals in De-
cember. Therefore, I fall into the 
ranks of the lowly who dare to 
decaf. I admit to having no discern-
ment in this matter-that is, I have 
no idea if decaf tastes more foul 
than regular. I realize that to im-
passioned coffee drinkers, this 
places me one nok:h below Nazi 
war criminals on the scale of hu-
man filth . But given the choice 
between regular and decaf, I'll take 
sleep.

he recognized the determination of 
North Korea, with a stsnding army 
larger than our own. 

American voters have shown that 
they are tired of government incom-
petence. While our president basks in 
the glory of Hiati and Iraq, he should 
also recognize the embarrassment of 
North Korea. Before he boasts of in-
ternational success, he should solve 
the serious inlernational problems.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Mo ..... y, Noy ........ ", 1994 

LETTER MISREPRESENTS 
SUPPORT OF MUIR COLLEGE SMOKING BAN 

EdItor: 
While I appreciate and respect 

Jeremy Davis' comments in bis let-
ter("MuirCollegeCommuterCoun-
cil Ignores Students," Nov. 10), I 
feel that it is important to clarify a 
few isaues. 

Davis states that the resolution 
WIS opposed by almost all of the 
public who attended. 

While this is true, two thirds of 
the "public" who attended were 
Muir House Advisors. Since they 
are Muir staff and residents, I would 
have been negligent in my duties 
in representing Muir commuters, 
had I considered only their opin-
ions. 

I also wish to clarify that while 
Jennifer Nicoll felt that she could 
not support the resolution, she also 

apparently felt that she could not 
oppose it, and thus abltained. At the 
meeting, she abo agreed that I had 
a valid concem about the effecta of 
second-band smoke on the health 
of Muir students. 

Davis also described me as a 
"Muir Commuter Council Repre-
sentative." According to"the Muir 
College Council Constitution alld 
its bylaws, my position is "Com-
muter Stlllklll Representative" and 
my job description states that I am 
to "actively represent the interest[sJ 
of Muir cOlrllPWUr sllUklllS." The 
10-1.5 commuters who attend Com-
muter Council meetingsue not rep-
resentative of Muir Commuter stu-
dents, but I considered their input 
IS commuters, along with the opin-
ions of the many other Muir com-

muten with whom I spoke, very 
carefully. 

Davia is conec:t in lIyina that I 
expreased a belief that smotilll is of 
the same mapitude of importance 
asAlc:ohoIAw ..... Wock.Smok-
ing is currently the number-one pre-
ventablec:ause of death in the United 
States, killing someone every 
minute. Even more frightening, ICC-
and-hand smoke is the aumber-tlucc 
preventable cause of death, tilling 
.53,000 people per yeu. 

In his letter, Davis suggests a 
smoking awueneas project, with 
which I completely agree. In fact, 
the Group Against Smokers' Poilu-
tion (G.A.S.P.), of which I am presi-
dent, announced in the Nov. 7 issue 
of the Guardian tbat a tobacco 
awueness week will take place dur-

illl the Sprinl Quarter. I hope this 
event will be II lIacceuful IS Alco-
hol Awareaeu Week. 

As for Davis' refereace to mari-
juana, I do not have any plans to 
attack marijuana smotina on cam-
pus. 

I simply desire to protect the 
health and livelihood of smokers 
and nonamoken at UCSD generally 
and at Muir Colleae in partic:ulu. I 
also have 00 plans to resip my post 
IS commuter council chair. Davis is 
coJ1'eCl in saying that I am not a 
-represcatativeofthe studeRt body." 
Rather, I am a representative of the . 
Muir commuter student body and I 
will continue to represent their in-
terests.

STRIKES: UC is 
unprepared for flood of 
new students 
CentInued ......... 1 

To make matters worse, the largest influx 
of new eligible students since the 1960s is 
expected totloodthe UCand CSU systems by 
t!le ,nd of the decade. 

While no one argues tbat the state will to 
shut down the University of Cal ifomi a to pay 
for the estimated 17 new prisons required for 
"Three Strikes· inmates, everyone agrees that 
very difficult decisions loom in the near fu-
ture . 
_et COIIIIct 

State expenditure for many social pro-
grams, including welfare and health care, are 
set by Washington. Constitutionally mandated 
funding such as K-12 education, which was 
under Proposition 98, accounts for much of 
the remaining state funds. 

Higher education, including the commu-
nity colleges, UC, CSU and student aid com-
mission, split the remaining 20 percent of the 
budget with the Department of Corrections. 

This funding arrangement places higher 
education in "direct. . . head-to-head competi-
tion·with the Department of Corrections bud-
get, according to California Higher Education 
Policy Cenler (CHEPC) Associate Director 
Joni Finney. 

University of California Student Associa-
tion (UCSA) Executive Director Glenn 
Magpantay agrees, saying that "the state gov-
ernment has effectively pitied [corrections 
against higher educationV 

However, others say that the situation is 
not IS simple IS Finney and Magpantay assert. 
Senior Consultant to the Assembly Standing 
Committee on Higher Education Andy Shaw 
agreed that "there is some competition," but 
added that the budget is more complex than a 
simple head-to-bead rivalry. 

Thc Deputmcnt of Finance's Kevin Eckery 
disagreed entirely, saying, "it is not a zero-
sum game." According to Eckery, the univer-
sity has other outside sources of funding such 
as endowment money and increased student 
fees, which it can turn to in tight fiscal years. 
The Department of Corrections has no such 
options. 

Eckery also says that theCalifornia budget 
has stabilized after four years of tailspin. 

They all agree, however, that as California 
slowly pulls out of a deep reces,sion, many 
difficult decisions about budget priorities re-
main. As CHEPC reported, "Not since the 
days of the Great Depression have the state's 
coffers been so empty. » 

And several new, potentially devastating 
developments sit just around the comer. 
TIdII Wa" II 

In the 196Os, the Baby Boom generation 
came of age and a large number of new stu-
dents entered California's system of higher 
education, sending enrollments through the 
roof. 

During tbe 19505, with the "tidal w.ve" of 
students still in elementary school, the Uni-

vmity of California began plaDning for their 
arrival. The university bmly prepared intimc, 
opening the Irvine, Santa Cruz and San Diego 
campuaca in the 19601 as thousands of UC-
eligible students graduated of bigh school. 

The Baby Boom generation bas grown up, 
but its children are now poised to flood col-
lege campuses throughout the state in the next 
several years. 

CHEPC estimates that this so-called "Tidal 
W.ve II- will be just as large as the first and 
that the UC alone can expect an enrollment 
increase of over 40,000 students by the end of 
the decade. According to Finney, th.t is a 
"very conservative number." 

With most UC campuses approaching full 
capacity, and a 10th UC campus at least 10 
years off, the university finds itsel" totally

unprepared for tile projected enrollment boom. 
UC Spokesman Mike Lassiter is hopeful 

that the current enrollment estimates are 
wrong, but admits that even if state funding 
remains constant, the UC simply "can't take 
massive amounts of new students." 

According to reports by CHEPC, the state 
Department of Finance and the California 
Postsecondary Education Commission 
(CPEC). however, there is little evidence to 
support the hope that enrollment projections 
are too high. 

In report publ ished in Crossttdk, CHEPC's 
newsletter, former UC President Clark Kerr 
stated, "If anything, the enrollment projec· 
tions are probably too low" because changes 
in the job market are making college degrees 
even more important. 

Finney is extremely critical of the 
university's poor planning. "Tidal Wave II" 
has been evident for years, she said, but the 
university has been overly concerned with the 
year-to-year budget difficulties and has not 
looked ahead . 

Instead of planning for the worst, as it did 
in the 19505 and 19608, critics contend the 
university is desperately hoping for the best. 

Almost everyone agrees that either the 
university will now have to abandon its prom· 
ise of an education to all qualified Califor· 
nians, ~ mandated by the Master Plan for 
Higher Education for the last 34 years, or the 
state will have to start shelling oula great deal 
more money. 

Unfortunately, the only available state 
money may already be spoken for. 
A 'line strikes MualnC? 

By next year, the additional funding r~· 
quired for "Three Strikes" will top $2 billion,

ICClOrding to estimates by the Department of 
Corrections. The budget will continue to grow, 
bitting an estimated $3 . .5 billion per year by 
2004. 

According to CHEPC analysts, "Three 
Strikes" is one of the most expensive commit-
ments in California's history. 
. While some of the money will certainly 
come from bond sales, the Department of 
Corrections will still require billions of addi-
tional dollars. 

In October, the California Higher Educa· 
tion Policy Center issued a report which stated 
that the "'Three Strikes, You're Out' law 
enacted earlier this year may be a time bomb 
that could, if implemented in its present form, 
undermine the college opportunities of thou-
sand of Californians." 

With California still recovering from a 
devastated economy and thousands of UC· 
eligible students poised to enter college in a 
few years, the addition of "Three Strikes" is 
not a pleasant prospect for budget planners . 

"Eventually, we [will]just run out of money 
for higher education," Finney said, "and it's 
in the near future." 

Eckery, however, says that it is ridiculous 
to look at the possibility of the state abandon· 
ing higher education. "That 's not going to 
happen. That's not how government works 
and that's not how people work," he said. 

Shaw agreed. "I don 't see the Legislature 
shutting down the [university systems)," But, 
he added, "Three Strikes" will "certainly have 
an impact." 

It is unlikely, according to Finney, ghat the 
UC will not have to make drastic changes in 
the next decade. 

However, according to Lassiter, the elimi· 
nation of nondiscretionary state funds, which 
is projected to take place by the year 2000, 
will "kind of eliminate [the UC) totally from 
the picture. " 
A ,... for tile Future" 

However, according to Lassiter, the UC 
.dministration does not see the university in 
competition with the Department of Correc· 
tions. "We haven't tried to draw such a con-
clusion directly," he said. 

He added that the universi:y itself has 
neither done nor requested any studies on the 
possible impact of "Three Strikes" on the UC 
budget. 

The university 'S position is a regrettable, 
according to Finney. Rather than acknowl-
edge fiscal realities, Finney said, "the leaders 
of higher education succumbed to political 
pressure" and kept quiet about the potential 
impact of the stiff sentencing measure. 

At las: month 's UC Regents meeting, the 
board began to look beyond Ihe stop·gap 
measures of the last four years and set up a 
constitutional revision commission to draft 
long· term plans to deal with changing state 
budget realities and the coming wave of UC· 
eligible students. By nearly all accounts, how· 
ever, the response is too little, too late. 

The Regents are now beginning to talk 
openly about abandoning the Master Plan for 
Higher Education, an option which was once

CHEPC sees only three options 
left 10 budget planners: "severely 
limit enrollment," dramaticaUy in-

population and the costs of "Three

acc::ording to Finney. 

While Finney said that CHEPC

EXCEL '94 
" Just do it! " 

While most students are 
usually fast asleep on any typical 
Sunday moming, Novernber 6th 
proved to be anything but typical. 
Nearly 500 leaders from across 
California and Arizona arose 
bright and early to participate in 
the EXCEL '94 Regional 
Leadership Conference held at 
UCSD. 

The UCSD Price Center 
was bustling with activity as early 
as 8:00 am when guests began 
lining up to register for the 
conference. UC Berkeley, Arizona 
State, SDSU, UCLA, and Cal Pllly 
Pomona are to name but a few of 
the universities represented at 
EXCEL '94. 

At 9:30 am, conference 
participants left not a seat to spare 
inthePriceCenterBallroomw~ 
they were welcomed by EXCEL 
Coordinators, Jen Zamegar and 
Devin Tighe. The introducation 
was followed by keynote speaker 
Mary Peterson, AssociateDirector 
of Campus Programs and Student 
Activities at the Universityoflowa. 
Mary's main message was this: 
"Learn to say no to something that 
you don't believe in, hang out with 
people who challenge you, and 
most importantly take time for 

you. You're the most important 
person in your life. W Mary's 
impressive presentation was only 
a taste of what to look forward to 
throughout the rest of the day. 

Participants, primarily 
student leaders from various 
university organizations attended 
sessions throughout the day 
dealing with topics crucial to 
building strong organizations. 
Response to the conference was 
extremely positive. When asked 
in an evaluation whether the 
participants would recommend 
EXCEL and/ or attend again in the 
future, answers were an 
overwhelming and enthusiastic 
·Yes'· 

Plans are already in the 
works for EXCEL '95. The UCSD 
Interfraternity Council and 
PanheUenic ASsociation plan to 
make the 6fth annual conference 
betterthanever before. By listening 
closely to the suggestions made by 
guests, coordinators of the 
conferena! hopetoeven better meet 
the wants and needs of future 
participants. Mark your calendars 
for November 12, 1995 when 
EXCEL will return to UCSD .

49ERS RULE: 
A fan sees the light

all time - Jerry Rice - to go 
ahead for good. 

Cowboy quarterbaclt Troy "I'm 
going to acbe after tbis game" 
Aikman attempted a weak come-
b.ck by burling bombs to Alvin 
Harper .nd Micbaellrvin late in the 
contest, but tbe Niners' defensive 
stalw.rts held firm. 

Buoyed by the efforts of "Neon" 
Deion Sanders and Merton "Gi-
raffe" Banks, San Francisco proved 
- finally - that it is the best de-
fensive unit that Eddie DeBartolo's 
Mafia money can buy.

Top-Dog Stanford 
bites UCSD polo 
Continued from PCe 14 
up junior Steve Crass' six-on-five 
bullet skip shot to the left corner to 
close the gap to 9-3, but· Stanford 
made its intentions clear with three 
quick points, the last a buzzer-beat-
ing two-point skip shot to the right 
comer from half-tank with only one 
second on the clock. 

The second half proved to be 
more of the same, although the Tri-
tons did muster a slight surge to 
open the third quarter. With 
Stanford emptying its benches and 
Harper inserting sophomore Sean 
Osborne to replace starting fresh-
m.n goalie Joe Welsh, the Triton 
offensive assault found a purpose. 
Senior Michael Yallech converted a 
scrappy man-up goal to make the 

The Niners shut down the 
Cowboy's rusItiDa au.ck and came 
up with big plays when they needed 
them most. In particular, a Hanks 
interception and an unsuccessful 
Cowboys on-sides kick proved that 
the Niners' defense was no fluke. 

What's left for me to do, you 
might ask? Well, I'm going to think 
a lot about what could have been, 
and I'm going to weep for the end 
of a dynasty. I'm going to ponder 
the mysteries of this crazy life -
how a man can be on top of the 
world one minute, and tbe next 
minute, it all comes tumblin' down. 

I mean, really, when it's all over 
and 48 minutes have been played, 
what's left to say? Go Chargers?! 

Nah. 

score 13-4, and Skaalen immedi-
ately followed suit, netting one of 
his patented two-point lob shots to 
the right comer to pull the Tritons a 
smidgen closer, 13-6. 

Alas, Stanford would permit no 
more, rolling off six unanswered 
points to end the contest. 

Despite the defeat, UCSD has 
little to hang its head about. The Tri-
tons will enter the Western Water 
Polo Association Championships 
seeded second behind Air Force, a 
team that has previously beaten San 
Diego twice in the 1994 season. 

"This team has come a long way 
this season," Harper said. "They are 
a very mature group and on any 
given day can compete with any-
body. Nobody looks forward to 
playing us, especially Air Force at 
WWPA's. Playing the Stanfords is 
nice and it gives us a lot of game 
experience, but our sole purpose is 
to take that tournament."

The final Triton scorer was jun-
ior Nate Johnson, whose gutsy run-
ning earned him a 27th-place finish 
in 27:40. And, in addition to their 
notable individual performances, 
UCSD's male runners kept the time 
gap between their first .nd last fin-
ishers to a low 2:11 difference on 

the eight-kilo~ter course. 
While the Triton women were 

shut out of the top 10, their efforts 
on the five-kilometer course proved 
to be an interesting mix of veteran 
leadership and freshman poise. 

Senior Karen Hinkle, nursing. 
broken bone in her foot, dashed to 
the first UCSD team slot with • 
15th-place, 20:08 time. Right be-
hind her was freshman Kyndra 
Smitb, who slipped into the second 
scoring position in 20:09. 

"[Smith] fell down early in the 
race, so [Zimmerman] pushed up to 
take up the slack," Van Arsdale said. 
"That [Smith] got up was outstand-
ing. And [Zimmerman] overexerted 
herself for the team 's sake."

Top-Ranked Cardinal Makes Tritons See Red 
RED SEA: UCSD loses to the number-one ranked Stanford water polo team, 19-6; WWPA tournament starts Friday 
By IrIIn K. Hutto 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Triton men 's water polo 
squad (8.22) rounded out its amaze 
ing 1994 regular·seaso n home 
schedule with a relatively 
uninspiring 19-6 loss to visiting 
Stanford University last Friday. 

Stanford entered the contest 
boasting the nation 's number-one 
ranking and had completely deci-
rr led any and all opponents at-
tempting to wrangle the top slot 
from them. Nevertheless, Triton 

Head Coach Denny Harper found 
himself somewhat displeased with 
his team 's performance against the 
mighty Cardinal. 

"There is no doubt that they are 
the best team money can buy," 
Harper said. "More power to them. 
They are in a league all o( their own. 
But we did not execute a very good 
game plan. I don 't like it when we 
make mental mistakes like we did." 

And against a team of Stanfo rd 's 
caliber, mental mistakes are lethal. 
The Cardinal broke this lopsided 

affair open early, nailing back·to-
back·to-back two-point scores, two 
by All-American candidate Jeremy 
Lassiter, to give Stanford a 6-0 ad-
vantage with only a little more than 
four minutes gone in the game. 

"They were not mentally in tune 
with the type of player Lassiter 
was," Harper said. "We knew go-
ing into the game that he could kill 
you with his two-point shooting and 
that's what he did. I could tell we 
were not mentally there after they 
had us down 6-0 right off the bat." 

Stanford's nearly impenetrable 
defense, anehored by former 
Coronado High School and NCAA 
collegiate All-American goalkeeper 
Jack Bowen, stymied the often-po-
tent Triton offense at every tum. 

It wasn' t until 1:15 remained in 
the first quarter that UCSD junior 
Carlos De La Barra intercepted an 
errant pass and drew a four-meter 
call. Senior James Skaalen con-
verted the penalty shot to put the 
Tritons on the board, 6-1. 

Unfortunately for UCSD, 

Skaalen's opener didn't faze 
S"nford's attack in the least. The 
Cardinal defense simply smothered 
Skaalen at the two-meter position, 
and the Triton offense found itself 
reeling under the pressure. Poor 
passing and sloppy defense was fuel 
to the Cardinal fire as Stanford 
opened up a 9-2 lead with three min-
utes to play until halftime. 

Harper did all he could to stem 
the tide, demanding a time out with 
1: I 0 left in the second quarter to set

biaJiligbt of the UCSD ~ coun-

meet? 

It WlID't neceaaarily JJ. CutDer, 
who finished first overaU, and it 
wlln't necessarily Karen Hinkle, 
who earned tint place on the UCSD 
women's squad. 

No, the hiaJiligbt of Saturday's 
NCAA Regionall in Chino was 
someone who collapsed on the 
course in the procell of giving it all 
for her team: Jane Zimmerman. 

·[Zimmerman] lhowed valor," 
Triton Head Coach Ted Van ArsdaIe 
said. "She was lying on the ground 
apologizing to me, but I was proud 
of her. She ran until her wheels blew 
out. She was thinking only of ber 
team." 

Almost overshadowed by 
Zimmerman's bravery was the Tri-
ton men's squad, which was buoyed 
by the spectacular efforts of Castner. 
The men captured first place over-
all, crushing a strong field of 
schools such as Occidental , 
Claremont-Mudd and Pomona-

18 SPORTS 

w. SOCCER: 
TSC was Lion in wait 
ContInued from ,... 20 
inside the left post to give UCSD a 
1-0 lead. 

The Tritons finished out the scor-
ing just 1 :2S later. This time 
JohllllOn was the one with the assist 
after taking a pus from Carrie Peer 
on the right side and racing toward 
the endline. When she got there, the 
sophomore turned and fired a waist-
high cross to the near post. UCSD's 
Carin Pugh knifed in at just the right 
time and got her thigh on the ball, 
deflecting it into the right side of the 
net. "[UCSD Head Coach Brian 
McManus] always says to believe 
in your runs and mine is to the near 
post. I got there and tired to kick it 
and the keeper had a little bit of 
trouble with it," Pugh said. 

The rest of the game was a study 
in control for the Tritons, who man-
aged to maintain almost constant 
possession. Wesleyan's only shot-
on-goal of the game came with 18 

minutes to play in the contest, 
when the Battling Bishops' A1yson 
Patrick launched a weak-kneed 
floater from 2S yards away. Not 
that the effort went unnoticed -
the UCSD crowd erupted in cheers 
for Triton goalkeeper Cari 
Schwartz, who finally got to touch 
the ball. 

UCSD finished with seven 
wiland 10cornerkicb, 10 more 
than Wesleyan. 

"We played really well and kept 
our beads in the game, even though 
we were really nervous at the be-
ginning,· Pugh said. 

"North Carolina was lying off 
so we had to pass around them in-
stead of going through them,· 
McManus said. "But [Trenton 
State] will be a different game, it 
should be 100 m.p.h. out there." 

Trenton had earned its spot in 
the Final by virtue of a 6-0 thrash-
ing of SUNY-Geneseo that morn-
ing. In the Lions, the Tritons would 
be looking at a mirror image. 
While UCSD was ranked second 
for most of the year, Trenton, the

defending national champs and 
holder of a Diviaioo IU-record 32-
game winning streak, bad been 
number one. Unlike JIIOIt East Coast 
teams, tbe Lions were a virtual 
track-team-in-cleats, due to their 
astro-turf home field and bigh-oc-
tane offeRle. 

That offense got off to a turbo-
clwpd start. Just two minutes into 
the game, Trenton turned one of the 
Tritons' favorite weapons - the 
corner kick - agaillll them. From 
the left lide, the kidt was headed 
backward by tbe Lions' Jennifer 
Hart and beaded again, thia time into 
the net, by teammate Tracy Pear. 

Fifty-nine seconds after tbat, 
Hart wu the one who scored when 
she headed in a left-footed cross 
from Pear. Less than three minutes 

in~ the game and the Lions were 
up 2-0. To say the Tritons were 
shellsbocked would be an under-
statement. Of counc, the big ques-
tion'was if UCSD could battle back. 

Outside of the team, no one had 
the faintest clue. The Tritons were 
usually the ones up by two after 
three minutes. UCSD did not have 
a reputation as a comeback team, 
simply because it rarely needed to 
come back. 

While the crowd may have had 
its doubts, someone forgot to tell the 
Tritons that the game was suppos-
edly over. With just under 10 min-
utcs gone, Amanda Johnson took the 
ball to the left side before centering 
to Diana Muchowski. Muchowski 
managed only a few steps before 
being run over by Trenton's TIna 
Husted. Lee took the free kick for 
UCSD and blasted one to the left 
post from 2S yards out, beating Lion 
keeper Danielle Mastrosimone and 
cutting the lead to 2-1.

Zaragoza got UCSD off on the right 
foot with a service acc on the first 
point of the contest. After senior 
Jenn Cross served up one of her five 
aces, and junior outside hitter 
Angelle Crochet banged a spike off 
the net, over and down, the Tritons 
had a 5-2 advantage. 

The Regals quickly called for a 
timeout, but sophomore Madelyn 
Ripken tore into one of her 11 kills 
shortly thereafter to extend UCSD's 
lead to 6-2. 

Cal Lu was looking to slow the 
Tritons' momentum once again 
when it called a second timeout af-

senior Julie Harvey spiked a ball off

The 4gers 
Are the Best 

I'm a broken man. No, I 
take that back. I'm a crumbled-
to-billions-of-little-tiny-pieces 
man. I'm lower than the 
wretched filth at the bottom of 
the deepest thoughts of 
Michael Huffington. I've been 
reduced to openly weeping in 
public. 

What, you ask, has reduced 
me to this pitiful state? Well, 
it 's quite simple. The Cow-
boys, my exalted team, lost 
miserably to those villainous 
4gers, 21-14. 

Now folks, I've only cried 
three times in my life. The first 
time was in sixth grade when I 
learned - rather painfully-
why it 's important to wear a 
cup in gym class. 

The second time was no 
more than a few years ago. 
Despite the emergence of a 
popul~r Michael Knight "evil 
twin" character named Garth, a 
haughty NBC executive -
clearly Beelzebub himself-
canceled my favorite show, 
"Knight Rider." 

But none of this was as 
horrendous as the Dallas-San 
Francisco game last weekend. 
It was the third time I'd ever 
cried, and it was the worst. 

The hyped contest statted 
innocently enough. The 

. Cowboys marched down the 
field like bad beef through an 
old lady, scoring the first 
touchdown of the game on a 
nifty Emmitt Smith jaunt. 

UCSD Just Inches Short of Title 
NCAA FINALS: Tritons 
finish second in nation 
By Greg Wrenn 
Co-Sports Editor 

If this were another sport, it would have 
been hyped as the "Game of the Century," 
which ended up with one team crushing 
the other on its way to a hypothetical na-
tional crown. But this was the NCAA Di-
vision III women 's soccer National Cham-
pionship, and it was settled on the field in 
championship style when second-ranked 
Trenton State defeated number-one 
UCSD, 4-3, in triple-overtime. 

The Tritons, who finished the season 
at 14-1-3, got to Sunday's Final with a 2-
o triumph over sixth-ranked North Caro-
lina Wesleyan on Saturday. 

The semifinal was exactly the kind of 
game which host UCSO was looking for. 
Mter three straight years of dropping the 
first game in a Final Four, the Tritons 
dominated the Battling Bishops from the 
opening whistle. Despite some early game 
jitters, UCSO overwhelmed Wesleyan and 
allowed the visitors only one trip past the 
center circle in the first 10 minutes. 

The Tritons, on the other hand, were 
bust, wreaking offensive havoc. Faced 
with a Bishops' defense which dropped 
two sweepers back and wouldn't allow 
UCSD to get behind it, the home team had 
to slow down its usual long-ball offense. 
But the Tritons were content to work the 
ball around and look for opportunities. 

But those glorious Niners 
bounced back. Quarterback 
Steve Young did the two-step 
all over the field, sprinting past 
his vanquished foes to set up 
the Niners' tying score. 

However, it was another one of 
UCSO's favorite offensive weapons which 
netted the Tritons their first score. With 
nearly 20 minutes gone in the first half, 
Triton Dawn Lee nailed a comer kick from 
the left side at the near post. Teammate 
Ele Johnson snuck in between a Bishop 
defender and Wesleyan goalkeeper Kim 
Olsen, positioning herself perfectly for the 
forehead-high pass that she headed just

The game then lapsed into 

total boredom for about two 
quarters. At this point, I 
counted the number of tiles on
