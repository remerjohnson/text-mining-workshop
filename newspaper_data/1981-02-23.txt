An odyssey with the WSW A 
A reporter tracks down an anti-government, anti-press service group 

BY PAUL FARWELL 
Several weeks ago, an 

organization - going by the 
non -descript name of 
Western Service Workers 
Association - came to the 
UCSD campus. Like other 
organizations, the WSW A et 
up tables, distributed 
literature, and even spoke to 
several classes. Nothing 
unusual occured during the 
WSW A's visit to UCSD. 

Nevertheless, (or because) I 
am a Guardian news writer, I 
was assigned to write an 
article about this unknown 
organization. 

I called the downtown San 
Diego number listed on their 
pamphlets. A young woman 
told me to come down the 
next day for an interview. 

Immediately upon entering 
the WSWA's office, hassles 
began. At first, Ms. X refused 
to talk while my cassette 
player was recording. And 
later, even with the machine 
off, -she gave me only vague, 
useless answers to even the 
most basic questions about 
the organization. 

I began to question Ms. X's 
evasiveness. After all ; I 
reasoned, why should an 
unknown 'public service 
organization be so uncooper-
ative with a reporter? 
. "The media in the past has 

only hurt us in our cause for 
the poor people," Ms. X 

Co-ops for 
UCSD are 
di~ 'hope 
But they work at 
other campuses 

BY STEVE GOLDSTICK 
Staff Writer 

For under-class students 
on many college campuses, 
off-campus living is 
something resorted to only 
when on-campus housing is 
not available, which usually 
is not too often. 

For upper-class and 
graduate students, living off 
campus is not unusual, but 
when they decide to make the 
move they usually have the 
option of staying where they 
are. 

At UCSD, for lack of other 
alternatives, living off· 
campus is often a necessity. 
Fraternitie' and ororitie 
are nowhere to be found, and 
sometimes student who 
would like to stay on campus 
can't because of the incoming 
flock of new student . 

Currently, about one·third 
of the 10,500 enrolled UC D 
student live on-campus, 
whil the average di tance a 
tudent living off campu '

replied . "The media talk . 
about too many things they 
don't understand," another 
member of the WSWA told 
me later. 

I approached every 
member in the office that day 
in hopes of gathering enough 
information to write an 
article worthy of the back 
pages of the Guardian. 

No one in the office was of 
any help. Instead of getting 
basic facts about the WSWA, 
I got an anti-government, 
anti·media philosophy 
heralding back to the 1960s. 
"They're (the government) 
out to hurt the poor people," a 
member in his mid-thirties 
told me. 

I left that afternoon with 
only a cloudy notion of what 
the WSW A was. 

After putting off the article 
for a few days, I decided it 
was time to confront th 
WSW A again. This time, 

advantages, like more 
privacy and sometimes fewer 
expenses. But what about 
students who don't want to 
live in dorms or crowded 
apartments, but still want 
the convenience of living 
close to school? 

One alternative i 
cooperative housing, which 
has been and is successfully 
employed on many other 
college campuses. 

The idea behind co-op 
housing -is for students to 
take responsibilit:y -feF - the 
maintenance of their own 

. home so that the cost of 
upkeep is reduced . In a 
cooperative setting, tudent 
u ually do their own menu 
planning, cooking and 
cleanup, thereby eliminating 
the co·t of hired help. But 
they are left the option of 
hiring out ide help, also. 

With monthly expense for 
living on-campus continu-
ou lyon the rise, the idea of 
cooperative housingat UCSO 
sounds appealing. But the 
pos ibility of it ever becoming 
a reality is far from probable, 
say' Larry Barret t. director 
of U ' O' s Auxiliary 

Enterpri~l's. 

after a little insi tence, I wa 
invited back to participate in 
a canvass. 

By going door-to· door 
seeking donation , I was told, 
I would learn what the 
WSW A was really about. (I 
would never be able to write 
an article by simply asking 
questions, I was made to 
understand.) In fact, I was 
discouraged from writing 
any kind of news story at all. . 
What the WSW A expected 
me to do with my experience 
on the canvass puzzled me. I 
later learned that the WSWA 
was in need of transporta· 
tion. I had a car. 

In order to participate in 
the canvass, I had to be made 
an official WSWA member 
for a day. I received an 
identification badge and a ten 
minute briefing. I signed the 
badge with a false name for 
no oth r r ason than 
suspicion of the WSW A. The 

Barrett says that no one in 
the administration has 
"seriously" talked about it 
because no serious "proposal 
by the students has been 
given to us," Barrett says. 

While the idea of co-op 
housing at UCSD is 
relatively new, on other UC 
campuses, it is commonplace. 

UC Berkeley, which has 
had co-ops for over 50 years, 
has over 1,200 student living 
in on and off campus dorms, 
houses, and apartments, in a 

---co-op situation. It is a prime 
example of how uccessful 
student-run housi ng can be. 

Fred Guy ,-un- the board of 
directors of the United 
Student. Cooperative 
A socia t ion , located in 
Berkeley, explains how and 
why the co-op do 0 well 

. there. 
"We . actually had in redi ·

the same, uninformative 
philosophical dribble I had 
recieved all along. 

In the office, I met Mr. G. 
who wa to canva s with me 
that afternoon. 

We began the canvass in 
one of the most poverty 

tricken areas of San Diego 
- the "L" street block 
between Imperial and 
Market. 

Mr. G. was a very able 
canvas er. Once a door was 
opened - albeit only lightly 
- he rattled off an 
impre sive monologue 
lasting at least five minutes. 

"The problem of the lower 
economic strata are getting 
out of hand," Mr. G. related 
to an apartment house tenant 
on "L' treet. He received a 
blank stare through a screen 
door. 

Slowly, aft r much 
listening and que tioning, I 

reasonable," says Guy. 
But the affordable- houses 

or apartment buildings 
around the La Jolla area 
aren't easy to find. 

Many cooperatives that are 
just beginning these days are 
usually rented with loans 
given from the National 
Consumer Coop Bank, ~hich 
recently helped the UC Santa 
Cruz campu set up two 
cooperative dorm s-. 

The NCCB, Guy explained, 
works through the USCA to 
help st udents g t off the 
ground financia lly . 

So wit h the pos:ibility of 
off·campu s coop rative 
hou ing around U SD 
vi rtually nil becaus of the 
towering prices, on-campu 
cooperat 've housing would be 
the only alternat ive. Forthat 
to happ n, the students 
wou Id need the cooperat ion of 
the univ r. ity and th UC 
Reg nts, because the Regent 
own all th univ rsity land . 

But even if stud nts were 
to get a lobby tog ther and

learned what the WSWA 
was . In order to give welfare 
benefits such as food, 
clothing and medical 
services, the members of the 
WSW A go door-to-door to 
recruit new members. The 
new members then donate 
time and money for the 
realization of these benefits. 

Most of the people on "L" 
street were either not home 
or not interested. 

"Ain'tthegovernment that 
take care of me. Ain't nobody 
else either. God take care of 
me.(sic)," an older woman 
related from the doorstep of a 
converted garage. 

Finally, we came upon an 
interested family. The 
mother related some of her 
problems with food stamps. 
"The government is a mess," 

he aid, agreeing with Mr. 
G .. that there should be an 
alternative welfare program. 
She convinced her spouse to 
fill out a form of membership. 
Mr. G. had a new member 
and I had a connection. 

Having achieved my 
purpo e for canvassing, 1 
decided to leave the "L" 
street area and return to 
UCSD. This created prob-
lems. 

Mr. G., weary from 
evading my questions and

Harrett doesn't think 
students would be responsi· 
ble for the upkeep of the 
facilities for that long, with 
new st udents coming and 
going every year. But he says 
the administration will keep 
an "o~n mind" to student's 
proposal . 

But despite Barrett's 
re ervation , Revelle College 
Dean Ernie Mort reportedly 
ha checked into turning one 
of Revelle's dorms into an 
experimental co-op housing 
project, according to AS 
representative Mark Laut· 
man. 

But, Lautman said, there is 
no way any Revelle dorm 
could be transformed because 
of the arrangements the 
dorms have with the food 
ervice. Apparently , the loss 

of busines the cafeteria 
would as ume from the 
tudents who would be living 

in the onverted dorm would 
have to be made up by the 
other tudents who are living 
in dorms. That is the main 
reason, 'aid Lautman. 

The other reason is th 
dorms would have to be 
rede igned. And with the 
olid way the dorm were 

built, it would be too costly.

'And you thought 
Reagan freed them 

Editor: 
I abhor name-calling 

(especilflly when it's directed 
at me), but the Reagan 
administration warrants, no, 
demands, a bit of good-
humored attack. One can 

. either laugh or cry at this 
administration as I see it; and 
as Ethel Kennedy used to say, 
laughter is better than tears. 

Take Nancy Reagan, for 
example; she's a natural born 
comedian. Judging from her 
style I'd say she's taken 
special lessons in "falling 
down from Don Adams. 
Nancy doesn't need a stunt 
man either; the way she hit 
the deck at the Republican 
con.vention, I thought she 
would have at least knocked a 
few teeth (dentures?) out. 

Now, on to the Bassman 
letter (Guardian, Feb. 17). 
Come, come, Mr. Bassman, 
you don't seriously believe 
that the senile ravings of an 
old fool actually freed the 
hostages? It was the hard 
work and careful diplomacy 
of Warren Christopher and 
other members of the Carter 
administration, and Iran's 
desperate need for money to 
pursue her fight' with Iraq 
that freed the hostages, not 
the irresponsible name-
calling of our dear President. 

It was especially funny 
when the press asked Ronny 
if he thought the Iranians 
would have . an adverse 
reaction to the infamous 
"barbarian" statement, and 
Ronny said, "What have they 
got to be mad about, they're 
the ones who took the 
hostages." Does t hat sound 
like an artful diplomat to you, 
Bassman? I think it sounds 
more like an irate five-year-
old. 

The only reason the 
Iranians freed the hostages 
just as Reagan was 

inaugurated was to 'pite the 
"Satan" (or whatever they 
called him) Jimmy Carter. 
Unfortunately, the Iranian's 
ill-timed move caused 
thousands of unthinking, 
clueless Americans to believe 
that it was Reagan who freed 
the hostages. 

Bassman should realize 
that threats and the use of 
force simply cannot work in 
the international arena 
anymore. Vietnam proved 
that , and the Afghans are In 
the proce s of proving that to 
the Russians . Bassman 
believes that General Haig 
"is fhe most qualified and 
experienced person for .the 
job" of Secretary of State. 
Indeed, Haig probably is the 
most qualified and exper-
ienced person in the 
obstruction of justice. 
Bassman also thinks that the 
Russians "are indirectly 
supplying arms to leftists in· 
San Salvador" (that's El 
Salvador, Mr. Bassman). It's 
too bad the world 's free press 
doesn't know that, and it's 
too 'bad the leftists in EI 
Salvador don't know that. 
The only people who think 
that the Russians and 
Cubans are supplying arms 
to EI Salvador are Mr. Haig 
and a few of his State 
Department goons. 

Why in God's name are VIe 
supporting a fascist regime in 
EI Salvador, where soldiers 
gun down unarmed peasants 
because they ask for wages of 
$3.50 a day, and where 
henchmen shoot down 
Archbishops while they are 
saying Mass and rape 
American nuns? Why we 
support this regime I do not 
know. 

Ronny also invites hi 
fascist pals from South Korea 
to America, thus legitimizing 
their government. Another 

The Guardinn 

policy of Ronny's is to insist 
on starting an arms race with 
a government that spends 18 
percent on its GNP on 
military armaments. The 
Soyiet regime may be headed 
for disaster. ' Productivity 
gains have ground to a halt, 
alcoholism rates are sky high 
and food shortages are 
widespread. Although these 
conditions are not unknown 
to the Soviet people, there is a 
new spirit of discontent after 

60 years of the Soviet regime. 
Are we to go down t he same 

road by overspending on the 
military? The American 
elites have the hubris to 
believe that America alone 
must stop the Soviet bid for 
world hegemony. We should 
enlist the aid of the Chinese 
in the west, and further aid 
from our NATO allies to the 
east. 

Ronny's speech writers 
must have worked overtime 

Monday, February 23, 1981 

for the fine address he made 
to Congress last Wednesday 
evening. The Pres id e n t 
didn' t even use those neat 
visual aids he used last time, 
like showing us what a dollar 
bill looks like, or showing 
everyone those nifty graphs. 
What Ronny did tell us is that 
he is going to make the poor 
suffer just a little bit more so 
that the rich can make more 
money.

-Hill Street Blues retake 
Editor: 

. This is in response to Mikel 
Toomb's article, "Cop Show 
Too Crowded" (Guardian , 
Feb. 2). 

Hill Street Blues is not 
without its faults; neverthe-
less, it is in many ways an 
extraordinary show. Ever 
since Aristotle, drama has 
been bound by the necessity 

. of having a protagonist, an 
antagonist and a stJ:aight 
narrative structure arising 
from the conflict between the 
two. What a writer does it to 
take that anarchy which is 
life and write about it in a 
way which ' illumines the 
human condition. 

Many of the complexities 
and contradictions which are 
part of the everyday world 
are left out so that drama. 

unlike life, will have order: 
Th~ result is necessarily a 
pale reflection of life: less 
dense in detail , less complex 
in scope and ultimately, 
stultified and less interest-
ing. 

Hill Street Blues is an 
attempt at a new dramatic 
form, an attempt to more 
accurately represent the 
chaotic nature of the world, 
and In particular, the lives of 
men and women who live in 
and around an unnamed 
police precinct that could be 
in any decaying urban area in 
the country, different only in 
the specific details which 
make up the generalities of 
life in the latter part of the 
20th century. 

Form, structure and 
content are inexorably 

in tertwined; you cannot 
make changes in anyone of 
them without the others 
chan~ng. too. While the 
tradItional Aristotelean 
dramatic form gives an 
audience plotlines with all 
the ends neatly tied up, the 
real world rarely behaves in 
so orderly a manner, and Hill 
Street Blues, attempting to 
more accurately depict the 
real world, also does not. 

Charlie Chan movie insults Chinese 

Instead, the series uses a 
jagged .narrative structure 
which spans many episodes 
and, as in the real world , 
problems are often left 
pending; sometimes, they're 
insoluble and just become de facto parts of the environ-
ment. Moreover, because Hill 
Street Blues doesn't arbitrar-
ily have to resolve the 
dramatic questions raised in 
the first act by the end of the 
show, it has time to explore 
several stories at once. 
Consequently, it is possible to 
have an hour drama with an 
extraordinary density, much 
closer to the nature of reality 
than a strict adherence to 
Aristotelean form would 
allow. 

Editor: 
Charlie Chan, a fictional 

Chinese detective created in 
1925, aepearing in 44 movies 
in the 30s and '405, has in 
1981 come back to life. The 
recent revival of Charlie 
Chan movies like Charlie 
Chan and Ihe Curse of the 
Dragon Queen perpetuates 
insulting and stereotypical 
images of Asians. 

Charlie Chan, played by 
Peter Ustinov in the current 
film, is consistent with 
previous Charlie Chan 
movies in form and content. 
The sly, wise, inscrutable 
detective has historically 
been played by a white actor, 
made to appear Chinese by 
having his eyes taped to give 
him the "Oriental slant," 
giving him a fake accent and 

having him stand pigeon· toed 
with folded hands and a 
slight bow. 

He spoke in jerky tones, did 
not use plurals and 
popularized the "Confucius 
say ... " phrase which became ' 
an offensive form of humor 
used by the American public 
and practiced at the expense 
of Asians. 

Charlie Chan is accom-
panied by anum ber of sons, 
played by Asian actors, who 
supply lightweight humor by 
frequently bumbling in the 
pursuit of a criminal. This 
type of casting implies that a 
white actor can depict an 
Asian as an exceptional 
person; but Asian actors can 
only depict themselves as 
fools. J

Asians by the media 
reinforces the negative 
s tereotypes Asians have 
fought for years to eliminate. 
Films such as Charfie Chan 
and Ihe Curse of the Dragon 
Queen distort the history, 
culture and contributions of 
Asian people in this country. 
Such films are derogatory, 
degrading and insulting to 
Chinese people and Chinese 
culture, and are gross 
perversions and satires of 
Chinese philosophy. 

Due to this, stereotypes, 
"jokes" and raci~1 slurs 
continue. If you are a Chan, 
you are often asked, "Any 
relation to Charlie?" Others 
may accost you with an "ahh 
Soo" or "Aiee Va" and 
perhaps a derogatory bow. 

False images are thus 
promoted without the 
presentation of realistic 
Images. These false images 
become the "reality" for 
those who rely on the media 
as their only viable source of 
information about the world. 
Unfortunately, the picture is 
a di torted one, particularly 
for those Americans whose 
sole contact with Asians is 
through Charlie Chan. 

The film's producer, Jerry 
Sherlock, argues that Charltc 
Chall alld Ihe CUr$(! of the 

Dragon - Queen had no 
intentions of insulting a 
group but was meant to be 
funnY rBut at whose expense? 
Are we to remain passive as a 
silent ' minority and allow 
ourselves to be exploited and 
humiliated? 

Far from being mere 
entertainment or "freedom of 
artistic expression," Charlie 
Chan is a product of 
Hollywood which makes a 
profit by selling distortions of 
reality rather than the truth. 
Movies such as this thrive 
upon and promote ignorance, 
and ultimately justify and 
perpetuate the un.equal 
social, political and economic 
status of Asians not only in 
the US : but internationally 
as well. 

Several pickets and 
bQycot ts protest ing ' the film 
have been launched state-
wide. Five major television 
stations in San Francisco and 
three in Los Angeles have 
joined the protest by refusing 
to advertise Charlie Chan and 
the Curse of Ihe Dragon Queen 
on the air. 
Boycott Charlie Chan!

What Mikel Toombs 
mistakenly calls, "a flurry of 
subplots" are actually the 
main plots. As in life, there 
are multiple protagonists , 
and when Toombs complains 
that the characters aren't 
"covered in any sort of 
depth" he fails to understand 
that he is dealing with a 
dramatic structure which 
describes life in terms with 
which he is unfamiliar and 
therefore uncomfortable. 

Mikel Toombs is so wedded 
to Aristotelean concepts that 
when he encounters drama 
based upon another model he 
criticizes it for beingdifferent 
instead of trying to ascertain 
what the nature and purpose 
of those differences might be. 
For thousands of years 
writers have used an 
Aristotelean paradigm 
because nothing else worked 
as well. Form and structure 
can only be evaluated in 
terms of the content that can 
be achieved through their 
use.

Editor: 

It ha come to t he at tention 
of the campus by your article 
(G uardian, Feb. 18) that the 
AS is spend.ing $300 of 
activi ty fee money for what 
they term an "educational 
experience" on April 25, 
featuring a s the main

head of the Pales tinian 
Liberation Organi zation 's

I was always taught that to 
make a good decision one 
must look at both sides of an 
issue. However, in this 
"experience" that the AS

where are the other views? I 
don't believe it should be the 

Council's righ t to pu t on this 
one· ided pol itica l ra lly using

How does the Council jus t 
ignore 500 studen ts who 
attended t he meet ing and 
voiced opinions against the 
move? And they wonder why 
no one attends the meetings? 

And does the general 
student know that he or she 
is, in fact , paying for thi 
rally? 

I urge · the Council to 
reconsider its move, and I 
urge the students of UCSD to 
start keeping closer tabs on 
how their "government" 
exercises its power.

Amid t he libera l. coll egiat e a nt i·

which I again mu t admit to) , I find it 
omewhat of a surpri e to ee what a little 

suns hine in February, or any other month of 
the year , can bring out of the educated 
minds that I share precious space with . As 
temperatures climb above eighty , as winds 
shift from the west to the east, and as "LA's

new and arous ing quality. 

It is conceived in the minds of my many 
fellow males, brings an ugly smirk to their

Women, can't you feel, Can't you hear

the smooth contours of a well-shaped bottom 
present themselves with such la'Ck of 
imagination to be disgusting.

Daniel Burrier is a senior at UCSD. 

the sexes mean equality in US mas media 
(Jordache) ex, then I concede defeat. If 
equalit y means that we s hould all have the 
right to view each other as "objects," if 
equality gives us all, male and female, the 
right to pursue by showing our flesh , then 
not only am r wrong, but I have been missing 
out on my rights. Given such a situation I 
suppose I have no recourse but to join the 
gang and long for the biggest pair of 
mammae that I can find . 

So you want to be liberated? Don't 
perpetuate images. r can't condone the 
actions of the drooling, starved and sexist 
segment of the male population (I usually 
walk away from such), but as throughout 
history, .the burden of obtaining freedom 
falls on the oppressed . Believe me, phrases 
such as the one above and such as, 'I'd like 
to be thai bicycle sejlt - she can sit on me 
any ti~e she likes," - in short, language 
generally characterized as locker-room talk, 
does exist. If you're male, you now it , you've 
heard it and -you are expected to enjoy it. 
Believe me women, it is there following 
every swing of your hips. _ 

So don' t be Mademoiselle-ites. How a 
woman gains her freedom and becomes the 
new. successful woman by being sexy I don't 
understand . Do you think men (or boys) will 
feel any need to change archaic at titudes or 
respect you as equals when you're dressed to 
entice? 

Attitudes need changing. Women, you 
must force the chan~e, not hope for it.

we walked toward my car. A 
I unpinned the identification 
badge from my shirt, I was 
surprised to see his 
outstretched hand comman-
ding me to return it to him. 

I refused to until I was 
iiven a reasonable explana-
tion. Instead of explaining 
Mr. G. got moreexpticit in his 
threats. "I can do anything I 
want here - there's no 
witnesses." he said. blocking 
the entrance to my car. 

Again [ asked for an 
explanation. Eventually. he 
told me that he needed the 
card to prevent me from 
falsely represen ting the 
WSW A. r tore the card to 
pieces and left it in the street. 

I drove Mr. G. back to the 
LOgan Street office and then 
returned home to continue 
my research on the WSW A. 

By phoning other welfare 
agencies in the Logan 
Heights area and intt;.rview-
ing people in the neighbor-
hood I had canvassed. I 
managed to piece together the 
followin~ article: 

The WSW A is a non· profit 
community-ba'sed social 
service organization working 
in the Logan Heights area of 
downtown San Diego. The 
organization's main function 
is to distribute food. clothing 
and medical services to the 
poor people of San Diego. 

The WSW A was ·estab-
lished in response to 
government cut-backs of 
s\1ch welfare' programs as 
BEOG. General Relief and 
Food Stamps. 

The WSWA's approach to 
welfare services is unique. 
Functioning on a grassroots 
level, the WSWA organizes 
volunteer labor into food and 
clothing drives on weekends. 

Skeptical of the govern-
ment. the media and other 
organized welfare services. 
the WSW A functions 
without any outside aid. 

As Charles Thomas, 
professor of Urban and Rural 
sfudies at UCSD, explained, 
the WSWA is a group with "a 
new philosophy. handling old 
problems with old strate-
gies. " 

Apparently the WSWA 
isn't the first pf its kind . . 
"The' 1960s gave birth to 

-. . ~ 

:>~ 1981 Hal Jepsen Films 
.' .. 

orga ni zat ion s like the 
WSW A." Dr. Thomas 
explained. "As the mood of 
the country turns again t 
g{)vernment organizations 
again , the 80s are likely to see 
a rebirth of such organiza-
tions ... 

WSW A has had a long 
ant.agonistic relationship 
with other welfare agencies. 
of both a government and 
non-government orientation. 

Merkel Harris. representa-
tive of Welfare Rights. an 
organization which provides 
general help to welfare 
recipients, has had several 
encounters with WSWA. 
"They (the WSWA) hurt the 
poor more than they help 
them." she commented. 

Apparently the WSW A 
existoo first as the California 
Homemakers Association 
(CHA). providing domestic 
services to the bed-ridden. 

Often. according to Ms. 
Harris, the WSW AlCHA wa 
directly responsible for the 
placement of welfare 
recipients into convalescent 
homes. "They (the WSW A-
CHA) got the client to request 
more hours of service that the 
state maximum would 
allow." Ms. Harris commen-
ted . Apparently, if a client 
needs more hours of service 
than the state maximum. a 
hearing is given and often the 
welfare recipient is taken 
from his/her home an~ put 
into a state rest home. 

According to an anony-
mous former-member, the 
WSW A is not only different 
in its approach to welfare 
services. but is also very 
radical in its political beliefs. 

"They are a counter-
culture group who believe in 
revolution, even violent 
revolution," she commentoo. 
"They can't bring about the 
changes they want inside the 
system. so they work 
separately from it. They 
trust no one." 

The WSWA is very 
secret 've about their political 
beliefs. Meetings are held in 
the members' houses and 
only the top tru s ted 
individuals of the organiza-
tion are allowed to partici-
pate.

Cable hook.s up 
local FM stations 
KSDT giv~ UCSD li1J-k to cable 

BY BLAKE SHAW 
Staff W rile.-

Would you like to be able to 
hear decent music on your 
radio? In San Diego? 

Ca1)le FM ' radio enables 
you to hear all of the local FM 
stations .c.1early. plus the 
extra ablhty ' to hear LA . 
stations such as KLOS and 
KMET, even if you live in a 
canyon . . 

Furthermore, it gives you 
the best in San Diego 
progressive music. namely 
UCSD' s KSDT and San 
Diego State's KCR, which 
presently can only ' be heard 
on cable. 

Just what is cable radio? 
Simply put. FM radio signals 
are transmitted along with 
the FM television signals 
which come to your residence 
with the installation of cable 
television. 

Therefore. if you have 
cable television. for another 
$1.75 to $1.95 a month the 
cable company can hook up 

your stereo to the cable so 
that you can receive Cable 
FM Radio. '[t can be done 
yourself - if you have the 
ability to do it you probably 
already know it. 

Rob Olmstead. KSDT 
Music director. states that 
over 35,000 residents in San 
Diego County have Cable 
Radio legally installed. and 
there are probably just as 

, many do-it-yourselfers. Since 
most cable radio listeners are 
serious about music. KSDT 
sees that it has a large 
potential audie.nce. "Every 
wt!ek we get calls from people 
in East County that never 
knew we existed until a 
friend told them about cable 
radio. I don't know why the 
Cable TV companies don't 
advertise this service more 
vigoriously," Olmstead told 
the Guardian. . 

Anyone who has fiddled 
with the dial lately knows 
that San Diego's normal AM 
and FM bands are empty of 
rock stations that are not 
gutted' with commercials 
have rigid hit lists (yes, KPRI 
and KGB·FM. too), and do not 
sound just like any othe 
To~forty or Middle of the 
Road station. 

The airwaves in Southern 
California are at their 
saturation point, with very 
little turnover in existing 
stations, mostly due to an 
FCC contract with Mexico 
which gives , M.exican 
stations much of- the dial in 
Southern California. Lis· 
teners interested in stations 
with new music. innovative 
and free music formats not 
dicta ted by advertisers 
interested only in a mass 
audience. have little 
alternative but to turn'to the 
stations available on ' Cable 
Radio. . .

deeply involved with their 
work and with the objectives 
of the organization. help 
them commit their best 
energies to getting things 
done, and help them derive a

Film/ Sam Gooch 

'Raging Bull' fails at 'realism' 
Martin Scorcese's Raging 

Bull. starring Robert DeNiro. 
is an impressive. albeit 
anachronistic, winner·turns-
loser, fighter·turns-flabbo. 
fast -paced film about a 20-
year span in thelifeofl940's 
middle-weight champion 
prizefighter Jake LaMotta. 

Raging Bull chronicles, in a 
loosely connected way, two 
decades in the public and 
private life of the rabble· 
rousing. stree t · tough 
LaMotta. In the ring he 
battles not only other capable 
boxers. but also the big 
money of the underworld 

sy ndicate .. At home he 
playfully and not so playfully 
roughs around with his 
passive and masochistic 
brother. and . inspired by fits 
of an implied pathological ' 
paranoia. he goes a few 
sad istic rounds with his 
stupid but femme/a tal of a 

wife. 
Despite its several st rong 

points . Ragi11g Bull is not the 
thing it has been touted and 
hvped to be. 

' First. and contrary to the 
DeNiro penchant and the 
Scorcese bent. Ragi'lg Bull is 
not the pinnacle of reali m. 
The much pu blicized "film de 
sacrifice" weight gain is 
perhaps more exemplary of a 
DeNiro neurosis than 'it is of 
filmic realism. If this is the 
odd brand of realism to which 
the DeNiro and Scorce e 
team a pire. better would 
have been DeNiro's absence 
from the film all together. 
Just end in the cinema verite 
crew for a few leazy shots of 
the real queeze·eyed pear· 
bodied Jake LaMotta making 
a fool of himself in some 
smokey and vamp-ridden 
nightclu b in Chula Vista. 
Then lock old Jake in a steam 
room with a few gallons of 
Gatorade and a crate of 
lettuce. ·Haul him out after 
about three weeks. tour him 
through the make·up room, 
then throw him inthering. as 
they did DeN i ro, with a 
Sugar Ray Robinson 
impersonator' who looks like 
a hylrid gleaned from Mickey 
Rooney and Sammy DavisJr. 
Or. better still, just go to the 
film library for a few old 
strips of laMotta action. 

The point here is not that 
DeNiro s masochistic efforts 
at reali tic portrayal were 
ineffectual. 

He doe indeed make a fine 
fat so. e pecially in hi 
pathetic . clammy . caress ing 
of the nightclu b jail·bait. As a 
result of this. DeI':iro 
manages a convincing 
portrait of the psychic angst 
of a broken and tortured man 
in existential despair.

The point here is that 
intentional extra pounds do 
not equal realis m. But even if 
it did. Scorce e does his very

best to thwart whatever 
realism DeNiro had in mind 
when doing the fight scenes, 
by using highly ~tylized 
lighting, over·exposure of the 
black and white footage. 
deliberate over·saturation, 
graininess and hick framing 
of the color sequences. clever

Second. then. Raging Bull 
i not a fight film, at least not 
in the "boxing" sense of the 
word. For all the sweating . 

spurting blood and bestial . 
grunting. the fight sequences 
are too polished for any sense 
of chaos. too chor~aphed 
to allow for any' flaJling or 
blundering. too smooth for a 
true feeling of realism in the 
ring. According to Scorcese. 
the 1940s prizefighters 
weren't ever allowed to dodge 
or block punches and 
subsequently he does not 

allow ~he actors to block. 
Never do any wrists or 
elbows get in the way of the 
perfectly timed, rhythmic 
haymakers that crullch 
noses and bring gushing 
torrent of blood with every 
jab. This is ok, though. It is 
entertaming and it doe make 
Y'Ju holler "Yuk!" and make

First for upp 
Spikers handle Golden West for win 

BY SCOTT ALLISON 
tall Writer • 

The UCSD men's volley· 
ball team thwarted a fierce 
Go ld e n We s t -College 
comeback attempt in the 
third game Friday night and 
went on to defeat GWC in 
four games, 15·4,10·15, 16·14 
and 15·]1. 

The victory was particu, 
larly sweet for first-year 
coach Steve Upp, who with 
the victory notched his firs t 

career win as head coach of 
the Tritons. 

Aft er the spikers crushed 
Golden West in game one, 
they seeed to become 
somewhat over-relaxed , and 
before t hey knew it t hey were 
down 12·4 in the second 
game. In contrast GWC was 
keyed up after being 
humiliated in the initial 
contest, and the visitors' 
surprising victory in game 
two knotted the match at one

game apiece. 
As i true in so many 

volleyball matche that are 
tied 1·1 in games , the third 
game is tremendously crucial 
and usually determines the 
even tual winner. Friday 
night 's competition turned 
out to be no exception. 

Game three saw the lead 
switch hands several times. 
but toward the end of the 
conte t. with Golden West 
leading 14·12, thing looked 
bleak indeed. 

"I was scared then," said 
coach Upp. "But we showed 
some spunk and character." 

UCSD bounced back by 
scoring four very quick 
points, and thus won t he all· 

important third game. 16·14 . 
Outside hitter Ha l Jacob~ led 
t he charge by bot h belting t he 
spike that made it 15-14. and 
by t hen loft ing t he perfect 
dink for t he winning point. 
Golden West looked dazed. as 
if they hadn't known what 
hit them. 

With the momentum in 
their hand, the Triton ' won 
the fourth game fairly ea ily 
and thus clinched t he match . 
The turning point of the 
match could easily be called 
the fast knockout punch at 
the end of game three. There, 
if GWC could have held 
UCSD at bay to preserve 
their apparent victory, they 
quite possibly could have 

won the overall match. 
The win for the Tritons 

goe down in the history book 
as the first career victory for 
rookie coach Steve Upp. He 
no dou IX hopes t hat it is the 
first of many to come. and his 

hope. may be justified if hi 
squad can take some of their 
occasionally -fine moments

Men '5, women '5 

N etters have big weekend, just lose 
BY SAMANTHA ROBY 

SCdWrker . 
,The men's tennis team 

pulled out an lith place 
finish in a 16 team field in the 
University of San Diego 
tournament last weekend, 
but appearances can be 
deceiving . While 11th 
position may seem like a poor 
finish, all of the entrants 
except last place finisher 
Redlands are in Divisions I 
and II. Both UCSD and 
Redlands are Division III 
schools. 

UCSD's number three ' 
seed, Brad Driver, fared the 
best of all the Tritons, 
advancing as far as the finals 
of the consolation bracket. 
Driver lost his final match to 
Rich Bohn of Brigham 
Young University 6·4, 6·4. 
The remaining Triton 
netters fell out of competition 
in the first .round. 

Nonetheless, Coach Peter 
Davis thought the team as a 
whole made a fine showing. 
"[ though we did quite well 
considering the caliber of the 
opposition ." The UCSD 
doubles team of Driver and 
Taber made it to the 
quarterfinals and fell, in an 
impressive exhibition, to 
Herman and Steinbroner of 

.USD 6·1, 7·6. 
The UCSD Women's 

Tennis team was just nixed 
54 by las t year's Divis ion III 
National Runner-Up, Biola, 
on the (llpos ition's courts. It 
was a close , hard· fought 
match that, literally, came 
down to the wire. Going into 
the last match (number three 
dou bles), Biola and UCSD 
were in a dead heat at 4-4. But 
the scales tipped in favor of 
Biola and the Triton number 
three team of Barbara O'Day 
and Susan Blakely lost a 
tough one, 4-6, 6·2, 7-5. 

Coach Liz Dudash is quite 
proud of her team and feels 
that they really accomplished 
something by giving last 
year's number two Division 
UI team a run for the money. 
"We did great. I'm really 
pleased. All of the girls played 
very well." Five of the nine 
matches went to three sets. 

Triton number one seed 
Cecilia Kavinaugh won a 
three-hour marathon 6-1, 4-6, 
7-6; number two Laura 
Saavedra los t 6-2, 3-6, 6-3; 
number three Lisa Gilbert 
easily won 6-4, '6·0; number 
four Elizabeth Saar came out 
victorious 6-4, 7-'6; number 
five Barbara O'Day was 
defeated 4·6, 6-3, 7-5; and

WSWAhas 
no p~rmit 
for efforts 
, '''11111111\'(1 t I " Ill p ag _ .-) 
believes that the WSWA has 
two sides, one good and one 
bad. 

"There are some really 
good people in the organiza· 
tion. They take welfare 
services very seriously. It's a 
lifestyle for t hem, " 'she 
commented, adding that the 
WSW A's food and clothing 
drives are very effective. 

On the other hand, 
"because · of their political 
beliefs, they often mislead 
students who come to work 
for them," the source related. 
Apparently , . students are 
informed of the organizations 
radical intentions only after 
working for a long period' of 
time. After that, they often 
tend to " be suffocated in 
pol itical indoctri nat ion ." 
This " indoctrination" was 
directly responsible for the 
anon y mou s member' s 
departure after six months 
with the WSWA. 

Ken Emsenaj i of the 
United Domestic Service 
Workers Union had similar 
experiences · with the 
WSW AlCHA. According to 
Emsenaji, the WSW A has 
interfered with his organiza· 
tion's attempts to unionize 
homemakers. "They're anti-
union," commented Emsena· 
ji. "They mislead the poor by 
say ing false things about our 
union and unions in general." 

GuWielines, a welfare 
referral organization, won't 
list the WSWA in its referral 
booklet due to the WSWA's 
lack of cooperation . A 
representative of Guidelines 
related her problems in 
dealing with the WSW A. 
"They have no criteria for 
poor," she said. In order to 
refer a social service 
organization, Guidelines 
requires a certain number of 
rules and regulations. 
Specifically , it needed 
information which the 
WSW A refused to give. 

Contrary to their propa· 
ganda. the WSW A offers no 
medical or legal services. An 
anonymous member of th~ 
WSW A comqtented that her 
job with the organization was 
to call doctors and lawyers in 
the phone book, asking them 
to contribute their services. 
According to her, no lawyers _ 
or. doctors presently work 
with the WSWA. 

The WSWA believes, an 
' anonymous source related, 
that receiving any kind of 
government aid causes an 
organization to conform to 
the system. The WSW A, in 
fact , avoids anything 
resembling thervernment's 
procedures 0 rules and 
regulations. 

On the other hand, several 
mem bers and former -
members have verY positive 
things to say about WSWA. 
"They do more than any 
official welfare organiza-
tion." commented one UCSD 
student who often worked on 
the WSW A food drives. 
"They are an extremely, 
dedicated group of people, ' 
he said. 

. "They (t he WSW A) came 
to UCSD in an attempt to 
connect socially minded 
students with southeast San 
Oiego. They wanted to show 
what it's like to be a poor 
person," he !\aid.

belonging" that it would 
generate - something she 
feels is lacking on campus. 
She also says that if the 
students had a home they 
could call their own, they 
would take better care of it. 

Ruth Romanger, who 
helpet.l UC Santa Barbara 
and other student co-ops 
towards self-sufficiency , 
shares these views. 

"All over the country the 
idea of housing cooperatives 
is becoming a very popular 
hous ing strategy," said 
Romanger. "Not only because 
it's cheaper alternative, but 
because it seems students 
want more of a sense of 
community living. Co-op 
housing teaches students .to 
take responsibility and it 
helps them in learning how to 
make decisions with a ~oup, 
two of life's essentials. ' 

UCSD converting any dorms, 
according to Barrett, does not 
seem very likely. In the 
future, the possibility exists 
but depends upon the 
students getting together to 
voice their support, said 
Vdovin.

in food services on his 
own, deemed it necessary 
to form an investigative 
committee on this case 
because of the "whole 
series of charges" brought 
against the management 
at Muir. 

And because of the 
seriousness of the 
allegations, Herm John-
son, vice chancellor of 
Business and Financial 

The Guardian 

Management, has stepped 
in to overlook the case 
with Barrett. 

The investigation 
committee con sists of thre 
UCSD staff workers : Jean 
Fort, Mike McGraw and 
Ray Pena. The members of 
the committee, tern1ed a 
"fact-finding team," were 
selected becau e of their
