Students from 50 states and 90 countries congregated on 
campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University this week-
end, held April 1 to 3. The conference is devoted to developing 
and implementing projects (called “commitments”) to global 
issues, such as poverty, pollution, LGBT rights and college af-
fordability.  

About 1,200 students entered the conference with individ-
ual commitments, 200 of which were from UCSD.  Students 
were required to apply to be participate.

The Clinton Global Initiative is part of the Clinton Foun-
dation, founded by former U.S. president Bill Clinton in 2005.  
Now hosting its fourth conference, the CGIU has been to uni-
versities in New Orleans, Texas and Miami.  

Clinton was on hand for the weekend’s event, and other 
guests included Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs, actor Sean Penn 
and singer Mandy Moore.  Jacobs participated in the opening 
session, while Moore spoke at the first workshop on global 
health and Penn appeared at the closing session. Students were 
also able to attend a variety of panels and workshops to prepare 
them to fulfill their commitment to face issues such as popula-
tion growth, the environment and global health.

“You believe you can make a difference, and we’re going 
to help you,” Clinton said at the April 1 opening session. “The 
most important question is ‘how do you propose to do it [com-
mitment]’ and college students are more prone for that ques-
tion.”

CGI U Campus Representative Melissa Etehad, who at-
tended CGI U in Miami last year, expressed her excitement 
over the event’s international scope.

“It’s an international event for UCSD, and imagine 200 stu-
dents changing the world,” Etehad said. “I am so excited for the

Carlsbad resident Julio Angel Garcia-Puente, 50, 
will go to trial for murder and arson charges following 
a hearing held March 30. He is suspected of killing his 
estranged wife — 38-year-old Lorena Gonzalez, whose 
body was found in a burning vehicle in the P701 
parking lot next to the UCSD baseball field.

At the preliminary hearing to determine if probable 
cause exists to indict Garcia-Puente, San Diego 

Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Fraser 
concluded that the prosecutors 
provided sufficient evidence for the 
case to stand trial, the San Diego 
Union-Tribune reported on March 
30.

San Diego firefighters testified 
that they arrived in the parking lot 

at approximately 8:30 p.m., when they 
found the vehicle in flames. According to the Union-
Tribune, firefighter Justin Price said that when he 
opened one of the car doors, he saw a head and an 
arm. Investigators determined that the vehicle was 
intentionally set on fire.

According to the Union-Tribune, deputy district 
attorney Nicole Rooney testified that Gonzalez died 
of strangulation, as three bones in her neck were

fter five months of planning, A.S. Concerts and Events 
Media Liaison Oliver Zhang sat down with the Guardian 
Sunday afternoon to leak the lineup for the annual Sun 
God Festival.

“For me, it’s the best lineup we’ve ever had,” Zhang said of the 
May 13 festival. 

Rapper Wiz Khalifa will be headlining the main stage, while 
Jesse F. Keeler (JFK) of electronic music duo MSTRKRFT will be 
the main act at the dance tent. 

Best Coast, Mike Posner, Jimmy Eat World and Crystal Castles 
will also play the main stage. The support for the dance tent — as 

well as one more act for the main stage — will be revealed once 
the artist contracts are completed.

“Not all contracts are fully executed,” Zhang said. “When we 
release something we want to make sure that the contracts are 
fully valid, just in case they back out at the last minute.”

Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events Brian Wong 
said he is proud of the lineup.

“We knew coming into this year that it would be hard to top 
the success of 2010,” he said in an email. “To make this year’s

domestic Violence Rates increase after nFl game losses
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Nisha Kurani
Associate News Editor

Reports of domestic violence 
increased by 10 percent in areas 
where the local National Football 
League team lost a game it was 
expected to win. 

“The study is about how emotional 
cues affect people’s behavior,” 
economics professor Gordon Dahl 
said. “When people’s expectations 
are unmet, they get this emotional 
cue that makes them very upset 

and unfortunately translates into a 
horrible thing, which is increased 
domestic violence.” 

Since football games evoke 
emotional investment, Dahl and 
UC Berkeley economics professor 
David Card examined 900 regular 
NFL games from 1995 to 2006 — 
comparing pre-game betting odds 
against eventual game results in a 
regular season for six NFL teams, 
which included the Denver Broncos, 
Kansas City Chiefs and New England 
Patriots. They compared predictions 
and results for the game to reports of 
domestic violence collected from the 
database of local police reports — the 
National Incident-Based Reporting 
System — in home cities of the teams.

Analysis of the reports 
demonstrated that the incidence of 
domestic violence was no different 
before the game had begun, or even 
during the first half of the game.

“Most of the violence is 
concentrated in a narrow window, in 
the last hour of the game and a couple 
hours afterwards,” Dahl said. 

Yet research showed that 
unexpected loss produces a greater 
change than does the pleasant 
surprise of an unexpected win. 

“Your happiness [is] relative to 
what you think is going to happen,” 
Dahl said. “Pleasant surprises don’t 
do much for us. When you are 
expected to lose but unexpectedly 
win, that doesn’t really reduce 
domestic violence.”

There is also no change in 
domestic violence when the team 
loses a game it was expected to lose, 
as there is less emotional investment 
in the game. 

The spikes in violence were more 
prevalent when viewers were more 
emotionally connected to the game, 
such as during playoff contention or 
in games against traditional rivals.

Loss to a rival team when the 
team is in playoff contention results 
in a 17-percent increase in domestic 
violence, while upset losses to a 
non-rival team witnessed a rise of 8 
percent. 

“If the game is especially 

frustrating because you were hit 
with an unusual number of penalty 
yards, your quarterback was sacked 
an unusual number of times or if you 
were intercepted an unusual number 
of times — when those frustrating 
things happen, then we also [see] a 
larger spike in violence of about 15 
percent,” Dahl said.

porcelain facings attached to a metal 
bridge, were found in her throat.

On Nov. 6, Garcia-Puente told a 
detective that he went to Gonzalez’s 
apartment the day her body was 
found to give her money. He said he 
believed she was involved in another 
relationship.

Prosecutors said Garcia-Puente 

initially said he argued with 
Gonzalez and left the apartment, 
but later changed the details of his 
story. He informed police that he 
wanted to have sex with Gonzalez, 
but she refused. Garcia-Puente called 
her a prostitute and the two began 
physically fighting.

Garcia-Puente said he pushed 
Gonzalez, which caused her to 
fall and hit her head on a piece of 
furniture. A search warrant was taken 
out on Gonzalez’s home, where no 
evidence of the struggle was found.

When she died, Garcia-Puente 
said he panicked and wrapped her 
body in a sheet. Prosecutors said he 
then drove the body to UCSD and lit 
it on fire to destroy evidence.

Garcia-Puente is currently held 
in county jail pending his trial. 
As a Mexican national, he has an 
immigration hold. 

If convicted, Garcia-Puente faces 
25 years to life in prison.

LIBRARIES EXPECTED To CLoSE BY END oF YEAR
By Laira Martin
Associate News Editor

Due to an estimated $3-million cut 
to library funding, UCSD’s Medical 
Center Library in Hillcrest officially 
closed on April 1. 

Four more libraries — including 
the Center for Library & Instructional 
Computing Services, International 
Relations and Pacific Studies, Scripps 
and Science & Engineering libraries 
located in Geisel Library — are 
expected to close later this year. No 
official closure dates have been set.

“We’re about 99-percent sure that 
these closures are going to happen 
for sure,” Campuswide Senator and 
Undergraduate Representative for the 
Library Committee Anish Bhayani 
said. “Depending on how severe the 
cuts are, we may be looking at more 
cuts in terms of hours, positions and 
maybe even resources.”

The Library Committee — which is 
comprised of seven faculty members, 
one undergraduate and one graduate 
student — is expected to cut anywhere 
from $3-6 million. University Librarian 
Brian Schottlaender planned for the 
minimal cut of $3 million as stated 
above.

“IR/PS Library would likely close 

later in the summer,” Schottlaender 
said in an email. “The Science & 
Engineering Library consolidation at 
the Biomedical Library will take place 
later in the year.”

Despite several closures across 
the board, the Library Committee is 
researching alternative study spaces 
for students.

“After this consolidation takes 
place, we do hope to offer a 24/5 
study space on the ground floor of the 
current S&E Library,” Schottlaender 
said.

Bhayani said current student 
activist efforts aren’t likely to help keep 
the libraries open. 

“Creating Facebook groups and 
petitions is almost meaningless,” 
Bhayani said. “[We need] some way of 
showing the Chancellor directly that 
what they’re doing is not fair and if you 
are going to cut the libraries, [students] 
understand, but make it a cut that is 
logically and mathematically proper.” 

Due to the bureaucratic nature of 
state funding, Bhayani said library 
funding has been harder hit than other 
parts of campus.

“The library budget comes 
primarily from state funding,” Bhayani 
said. “Over the past few years, state 
funding has decreased; so has the 

libraries’ budget, but it has decreased at 
a disproportional rate. Although UCs 
are getting 10 percent less funding, 
library funding is dropping by almost 
20 percent.” 

Due to this large drop in funding, 
UCSD libraries are finding it difficult 
to sustain various library positions and 
facilities. 

“The sad truth about the 
administration is enough money is 
[floating] around to keep most if not 
all the libraries open,” Bhayani said. 
“The staff and admin, who were hired 
on the promise to uphold UCSD’s 
mission statement, feel their pay 
and benefits far exceed the need for 
libraries. The students are victims of a 
cruel, bureaucratic and greedy system 
we call the University of California.”

Although Library Committee 
members have stressed the likelihood 
that several libraries will close, 
nothing beyond the Hillcrest closure is 
currently official.

“While UCSD’s budget situation 
does not look good, the libraries still 
do not have our final budget allocation, 
so these plans are subject to change,” 
Schottlaender said.

EndorsEmEnts

We’ve heard Jasmine Phillips’s cam-paign promises before, and they’re not nearly as flashy as suggestions of off-campus Greek housing, 
immediate fixes to the parking problems or mov-
ing to D-I athletics. We’ve rallied around old cries 
to fight student fees and prioritize education, 
and yet we’re still looking at an 8-percent tuition 
increase come fall.

Which is exactly why we need to keep fight-
ing, and why Phillips’s passion for social justice 
and UC accessibility makes 
her the best candidate for 
A.S. presidency.

Phillips has worked with 
students across a wide array 
of campus communities, 
from serving on the Black 
Student Union and the 
Student Affirmative Activity 
Committee to mentoring 
Sixth College students to 
sitting on the Chancellor’s 
Advisory Committee as A.S. 
Associate Vice President of 
Diversity Affairs last year. 

She has experience working with adminis-
trators on campuswide committees, prioritizes 
important issues like environmental sustainability 
and education and realizes that now’s not the 
right time for new $50-plus D-I student fees. 

She’ll keep Chancellor Fox and Vice 
Chancellor Rue honest about the changes prom-
ised in the aftermath of the Compton Cookout 
last year, and likely prevent council from passing 
needless — and expensive — student-fee referen-
dums. 

But while Phillips is dreaming big, and has 
the experience to promote her ideas, she should 
develop more detailed plans of reaching her 
goals and adopt some of her opponents’ ideas 
for increasing council efficiency. Ryan O’Rear of 
Tritons First suggested biquarterly budget meet-

ings that could go a long way toward alleviating 
confusion over how much funding council has 
allocated. And Alyssa Wing’s goal of fixing coun-
cil from the inside out and focus on efficiency 
makes her a good second choice. The head of the 
Board the Wing slate proposes a committee spe-
cifically devoted to figuring out the council’s rules 
and updating them — and close investigation of 
this kind is exactly what the council needs to alle-
viate the inconsistencies that have long hindered 
the group’s effectiveness. 

Phillips should also 
take warning from the 
experience of current A.S. 
President Wafa Ben Hassine. 
Ben Hassine — who ran and 
won on the Students First 
slate last year — has had a 
term paralyzed by a Senate 
filled mostly with Tritons 
First candidates, and an 
executive branch split across 
three slates. 

Phillips will need to 
work especially hard to 

bridge the gap that has developed this year and 
stress civility and cooperation on the council 
floor, no matter the political composition.

 Of course, Wing and O’Rear’s focus on spirit, 
pride and athletics are representative of the 
wishes of members of the student body. These 
are issues that should be addressed, and Wing 
and O’Rear’s respective, and highly qualified, vice 
presidential candidates will be able to advocate 
for them on the council floor. 

But the role of the president is to be the moral 
compass of student government, and it is here 
that Phillips shines in her prioritization of the 
basic goal of the UC system   — accessible educa-
tion for as many qualified students as possible. 
Phillips recognizes the importance of defending 
issues that would unequivocally benefit all Tritons 
— not just athletes or the Greek community.

JasminE PhilliPs StudentS FirSt

Among another year’s crop of unin-formed poseurs, Meredith Madnick’s the real deal. The Eleanor Roosevelt 
College junior — who’s served on council 
since her freshman year — has been around 
long enough to see countless councilmembers’ 
promises go unrealized, and has all the stron-
ger sense of what a group of a couple dozen 
student government firebrands can actually 
accomplish in three quarters. 

As this year’s council Speaker, Madnick 
possesses a near-encyclopedic knowledge of 
not just the rules governing Wednesday night 
meetings, but of the internal problems that 
have plagued the council floor this year. She 
holds, in short, the strongest remaining institu-
tional memory on council, and was this board’s 
most obvious choice.

Beyond her impressive knowledge of 

council history, Madnick’s also spent the past 
couple years as a diligent observer of the Office 
of Student Life, and knows what’s worked and 
what hasn’t. She commends the work of outgo-
ing VP Student Life Kristina Pham (with the 
glaring exception of March’s Winter Triton 
Fest fiasco, which saw two divisions of Student 
Life, Concerts and Events and Athletics, plan-
ning major events for the same night). But she 
also recognizes that for most councilmembers, 
Pham included, there’s a steep learning curve 
at the beginning of the year that prevents 
much from getting done — an issue Madnick, 
if elected, would skirt with ease.

Her opponents emphasized bringing orgs 
together; in her interview, Pam Sran of Tritons 
First suggested having a greater presence at 
Bear Gardens to increase interaction between 
different parts of campus, which is important 
in light of increasing polarization. But Sran, 
and Students First candidate Donald Zelaya, 
lack Madnick’s experience. 

And unlike some running this spring, 
Madnick acknowledges that there isn’t a whole 
hell of a lot distinguishing the majority of the 
slates from one another. (Names included: The 
average Library Walker stroller would likely be 
hard-pressed to distinguish between such wild-
ly varied monikers as Students First, Tritons 
First and We Are Tritons). That recognition is 
especially important in light of the fractions on 
this year’s council, which Madnick knows all 
too well. 

We like her ideas for expanding current 
programming in the Office of Diversity Affairs 
(Madnick wants to see more broadly inclusive 
diversity-sponsored dinners to promote more 
constructive discourse), as well as her proposal 
to have each of the six college festivals work in 
conjunction with the A.S. Concerts and Events 
office, which tends to possess superior know-
how when it comes to event planning. 

Her ideas for reaching out to students — 
streamlining council’s myriad Web pages, 
instituting a weekly “Ask A.S.” table on Library 
Walk and using a live Twitter feed during 
weekly meetings to keep students in the know 
— also represent inexpensive, entirely doable 
changes for an office too often overshadowed 
by the Sun God Festival. From a student leader 
as experienced and as capable as Madnick, 
we’d expect no less.

The prospect of paying more to 

maintain decades-old services isn’t 
appealing, but with key recreation facili-
ties under threat of closure, passing the 
Canyonview referendum is in the best 
interests of students and sports teams. 
The fee is a mere renewal of the $12 
we currently pay quarterly to maintain 
facilities, with a $10 adjustment for infla-
tion. Its passage would yield about $1.3 
million per year, which will support staff 
salaries, maintenance and operation of 
facilities like the Canyonview swimming 
pool and two Jacuzzis.

the Che Café — constitute a majority of 
student hubs on campus. Without the 
$5-per-quarter referendum, student orgs 
— including A.S. council itself — will be 
charged for using these facilities to the 
tune of anywhere from $10 to $100. 

On top of paying for rooms, no ref-
erendum means Price Center will no 
longer be open 24 hours and will likely 
close for eight hours a night, from 11 
p.m. to 7 a.m.



oPINIoN THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

Matt Bradbury, ERC Senator, hopes 
to get rid of the senator stipend — a 
$10 weekly sum that he voluntarily 
does not collect and calls superflu-
ous. His extended experience with the 
A.S. Finance Committee and Athletics 
Committee has spurred him to advocate 
committee reform to promote a greater 
sense of responsibility among members.

Bradbury’s strong opinions are both 
a strength and weakness. His firm sup-
port of D-I athletics means he hopes to 
fully inform his constituents by survey-
ing opinion and running town halls.  

But he implies that he doesn’t see the importance of 
fighting student fees because, eventually, “you have to 
pay more” — an attitude that could prove dangerous 
with fee hikes all but assured for next year. 

i n a year marked by budget woes and over-spending, Muir College junior and Tritons First candidate Lynne Swerhone’s priori-
ties of financial consistency and working with 
students at the source make her the strongest 
contender for Vice President of Finance and 
Resources. 

Swerhone’s council experience — two years 
as Muir College Senator, one year as Chief of 
Staff for the Office of Finance — give her a 
broad understanding of the workings of every-
one’s favorite student bureaucrats, and espe-
cially the office that divides up all its money. 
But it’s her experience outside that fourth-floor 
forum and practical ideas that sets her apart.

Swerhone works at student-org home base 
OneStop —  interacting daily with the very 
students that councilmembers are always try-
ing to entice to visit — and is the only  can-
didates acknowledging the failure of “classic,” 

candidate-favorite suggestions for improving 
visibility: lonely office hours, buried Facebook 
events, apathetic Library Walk demonstra-
tions. Instead, she advocates working directly 
with the population who most often comes 
into contact with council: student org leaders. 
Her work has allowed Swerhone to see the 
impact of council’s decisions from the other 
side and lent her an important perspective on 
what can be changed. 

Swerhone also says that working with 
OneStop, and helping students when council 
says no, is a way for her to feel less guilty about 
when, under her control, council would need 
to say ‘no’ to some of the bright, shining faces 
that often crowd the Forum looking for extra 
money. 

From Bollywood dance team competi-
tions to acapella group TriTones and their 
wished-for Taylor Swift trip, council’s history 
is fraught with over allocation — which makes 
Swerhone’s assertion that “the finance needs 
to learn to say no to exceptions” all the more 
welcome. She acknowledges the difficulty of 
disappointing others, but says she is willing to 
do so in the name of fiscal responsibility and 
will seek to help student orgs in other ways, 
with finance and fundraising workshops. 

 Aside from the office, Swerhone’s cautious 
support of the D-I move, contingent on the 
amount of student fees and her perception of 

the divisive power of slate politics, are high-
lights of a reasonable platform. 

Though Board the Wing’s Kevin Hoang 
lacks Swerhone’s outside experience, his goals 
of simplifying funding guidelines and cham-
pioning collaboration within the Student Life 
Business Office make him a good second 
choice.

StudentS FirSt

a current campuswide senator and mem-ber of the Students First slate, Flores has already made his mark by spearheading 
the move to ban harmful steam cleaners. After 
becoming aware that the cleaners were respon-
sible for widespread injury among cleaning staff, 
he introduced a resolution to ban them that not 
only received overwhelming council support, 
but resulted in an even rarer achievement: the 
realization of the resolution’s aim, as the Housing, 
Dining and Hospitality department ended up 
switching cleaning methods. 

This alone shows that Flores is paying atten-
tion and has the stamina to see a project through. 
Combined with a perfect attendance record in a 
council fraught with absentees, and his sugges-
tions to create a absence committee to increase 
accountability, Flores is a standout among a pack 
of big talkers. 

Flores’s priorities of fighting tuition increases, 
lobbying the D.R.E.A.M. Act, encouraging student 
voting and fighting for increased taxpayer support 
of higher ed are the usual for the office, but his 
three-plus years of involvement in the External 
Affairs office and track record of statewide lobby-
ing give him the background and passion to see 
his ideas through. This foundation sets him apart 
from Board the Wing’s Samir Naji, whose history 
is working at the community college level, and We 
Are Tritons’ Sarah Johnson, who is approximately 
a year behind on the issues on council’s plate.

Flores hopes to make the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee more inclusive by bringing in 
Greek and athletic representatives instead of just 
the representatives from diversity-oriented orgs 
And instead of just sending these reps to meet 
with other campus councils, he hopes they, as well 
as the rest of the external department, will lobby 
local politicians. 

Flores has more than proven his competence; 
with him in office, the office is sure to be revital-
ized after a lackluster year with lukewarm action.

CAMPUSWIDE SENATORS

matt 
brAdbury

Everyone wants to 
unify the school, but 
current Campuswide 
Senator Melissa Etehad’s 
involvement in diverse 
activities  might just 
be the ticket to bringing council 
together. In addition to participating 
in Jewish cultural org Hillel, she is  
student director of the Clinton Global 
Initiative and has worked tirelessly to 
organize the event, which saw more 
than 1,200 delegates from across the 
country.

Etehad plans to look outside UCSD to create action; she wants 
to get local media involved to create tension over library closures, 
and wants to revive the student activism that was nowhere to be 
seen this March 2. She advocates council dinners for inter-council 
unity, and acknowledges the detrimental effects of state politics, 
promising to be open to cooperation among any set of fellow 
senators.

Current ERC Senator and Board 
the Wing candidate Karen Liang is 
a cheerleader of campus spirit and 
athletics with the knowledge to back 
her ideas. As ERC council special events 
co-director, Liang wrote the “A to Z” 
ERC guide, and initiated a regular 
provost’s lunch for students to put a face 
to college leadership. 

As a student rep on the Athletics 
Committee, evaluating the feasibility of 
football, Liang has experience dealing 
with administrators. 

She plans to tackle the notorious 
lack of spirit by promoting pre-game tailgates before games, 
collaborating with sports teams, the Greek community, A.S. Council 
and Triton Tide. 

Liang suggests publicizing senator projects to make 
councilmembers more accountable for the initiatives, and create 
committees to address council’s fragmentation.

Jacob Robinson lacks prior council 
experience, but his work with the Students 
with Disabilities Coalition makes him  
a representative of important constitu-
ency often absent from the floor. As the 
only student rep on the Committee on 
Inclusion and Disability, Robinson works 
with faculty and staff to ensure campus 
buildings are accessible for all.

The charismatic Revelle College 
sophomore has proven himself far better 
informed than the average candidate, speak-
ing to his opposition of D-I with both statis-
tics and finesse. He advises cultural educa-

tion fairs that have the same inviting atmosphere of the 
weekly farmer’s market — and is forthcoming and willing 
to learn when he doesn’t know about an issue, a trait the 
voting members of council could use a little more of.

Current A.S. Marshall 
Senator Annie Yu hopes 
to see more visibility and 
transparency on council 
next year — and while 
those might just comprise 

the two most hackneyed buzzwords on 
this year’s campaign trail, we do see some 
merit in Yu’s plans. 

Yu plans to expand the campus’s 
Goodwill donation boxes come the end of 
Spring Quarter, as those in Marshall College 
tend to overflow. She follows the Tritons 
First party line on most issues — she sup-
ports putting the move to DIV-I athletics to a student vote as well as a 
higher cap on media-org funding — but Yu can also speak at greater 
length to this year’s problems on council than most of her opponents 
can. 

Plus, as a representative on the campuswide Athletics Committee, 
which spearheaded the recently-published feasibility report on the 
move to DIV-I, Yu is also practiced in dealing with administrators —

Students First candidate Cecilia 
Zhou is focusing on the small changes 
to make a big difference in sustain-
ability. 

There’s a lot of support for making 
the campus more green, but this Office 
of the President corporate accountabil-
ity intern has one of the few concrete 
ideas. She wants to create a committee 
and then work with administrators to 
investigate how much excessive electricity 
our campuses wastes by keeping lights on 
late at night. 

 Unlike other candidates paying lip ser-
vice to keywords like transparency and accountability, Zhou wants 
to publicize senator projects via excel sheets to increase account-
ability and reinforce what each senator should do. 

And in light of library closures, she plans to promote tutoring 
and resource centers, while informing students of places they can 
go “after hours,” like the LGBT Center and Women’s Center.

Out of the 23 campuswide senatorial candidates running for A.S. Council this year, seven proved unable to use a Web application to set 
up a proper interview time. Of those remaining, several didn’t know what was on the ballot. Some still couldn’t pronounce former A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta’s name. One couldn’t pronounce “Geisel.”  Though eight will be elected to campuswide senatorial positions, the 
Guardian Editorial Board only felt confident in endorsing six of those we interviewed — three Students First candidates, one Tritons 
First contender and two of the Board the Wing slate.

500 Fewer Guest Tickets to be Offered for 
Sun God Festival, Price Increases to $50

event, and all the people you get to talk to about 
their commitments.”

Several students, including Etehad, said that 
networking and meeting other forward-thinking 
students was a large portion of the experience. 

“You will get more out of talking to each other 
than anything else you do,” Clinton said.

This is the first time that CGI U has been on 
the West Coast. UCSD was selected over other 
schools, including UC Berkeley and UCLA. 
The initiative chooses host campuses based on 
schools that they feel most display the goals of 
the conference.  

Clinton said that his reasons for selecting 
UCSD included its strong track record for com-
munity service and research in science; he cited 
the Washington Monthly’s ranking of UCSD as 
no. 1 in government research expenditures. 

He also added that UCSD’s proximity to 
Mexico would help bring to light issues such as 
immigration and drug cartels.

The weekend started with an opening session 
including President Clinton, Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox and Jacobs, with a panel including 
YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley and Shirley 
Ann Jackson, former chairman of the U.S. Nucle-
ar Regulatory Committee and current president 
of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  

The 1,200 CGI U delegates were joined at the 
opening plenary session by 2,500 UCSD students 
and faculty.

The CGI U has reached over 3,000 commit-
ments since its inception, including ideas that al-
low people to easily sponsor students in destitute 
countries, talk with students in the Middle East 
and help AIDS patients receive the proper dosage 
of medication. All these ideas were developed by 
delegates at this year’s conference.

“Students have done remarkable things,” 
Clinton said. “They have amazing ideas. What 
we lack in money, we make up for in ideas and 
energy.”

Warren College senior Maclen Zilber had 
his commitment mentioned by Clinton.  Zilber 
wants UCSD to increase its use of the American 
Opportunity Tax Credit this coming year.  The 
tax credit, extended by Congress last year, allows 
students to deduct the cost of tuition, books and 

other expenditures from tax reports. 
During the conference, the initiative held an 

online bracket of commitments, where people 
could vote for the ideas they deemed the best.  

Out of the 16 commitments initially cho-
sen, the winning idea was a  project called “The 
School Fund” — developed by two students from 
Brown University who wanted to provide mon-
ey to impoverished children in the developing 
world to help them afford a basic education.

Clinton also focused on the issue of college 
affordability — the theme of Zilber’s commit-
ment — especially in light of the dramatically 
decreased number of graduates in the U.S. 

“Higher education is the key for us being suc-
cessful,” Clinton said, “The decrease in graduates 
is a major problem with the cost of higher educa-
tion. [Maclen] recognizes something that a lot of 
people don’t [the tax credit.”

Zilber reflected on his experience at the con-
ference.

“It was an honor and a privilege [to attend 
the conference], and a surreal experience,” Zil-
ber said. “Spending time among hundreds of 
the most dedicated and impressive young lead-
ers that you will ever see together in one room 
inspired me and honestly changed the way I ap-
proach problems.”

Nuseir Yassin, a Harvard student with a com-
mitment involving micro-finance, echoed the 
statements of other delegates.

“CGI U was a great inspirational experience 
as well as a helpful networking opportunity,” 
Yassin said. “The conference itself was a step-
ping stone for us to achieve our commitment. 
As for UCSD and San Diego, I think the place 
is breathtaking, especially for a student living in 
Cambridge.  UCSD students were also very help-
ful and friendly.”

Clinton added that people needed to decen-
tralize the provision of energy as well as change 
current transportation methods to help combat 
global warming.  

In terms of costs, the Clinton Foundation 
foots most of the bill, with UCSD providing re-
sources such as volunteers and buses.

lineup even more impressive, we wanted to 
make every act fun and relevant.  I believe we 
did it and this year’s lineup is the most exciting 
and diverse one Sun God has ever had.”

The main stage and dance tent openers will 
be selected at the Battle of the Bands and Sun 
God Space Jam, both to be held at Porter’s Pub 
April 7 and April 8, respectively. 

The bands and DJs competing for the slots 
were narrowed down by an online student vote. 

Six bands — Lucid 
Stereo, Gao Gao and 
the Bamboo Shoots, 
Scooter and Oliver, 
The City Walls, Kera 
and the Lesbians 
and Tré Elite — and 
six DJs — Digital 
Decay, DJ Philly, 
The Dream Team, 
JameRSun, NOLD 
and StereoChemistry 
— will battle at each 
event for a chance to 
play at Sun God. 

The rest of the 
lineup was chosen 
by the A.S. Concerts 
and Events staff, with 
regard to student 
input from Facebook 

and forums the office held.
“The booking process for this year’s Sun 

God has been quite the long and ongoing 
experience since Fall Quarter,” festival coor-
dinator Jeremy Gabriel said in an email. “As 
we expected, we had our share of road bumps, 
disappointments with certain artists being 
unavailable, the inevitable onslaught of ‘This 
Artist for Sun God!’ Facebook pages, and the 
amusing fake lineups.”

The festival’s total budget, which is drawn 
from student fees and guest ticket sales that 
A.S. Council allocated, is roughly $530,000, 
with around $190,000 spent on the talent. 
Zhang said security for the festival  is approxi-
mately $40,000. Last year, ASCE spent about 
$690,000 on Sun God Festival, $40,000 of 

which went to security and about $120,000 of 
which went toward the talent.

There have been other changes made to 
the event. This year, Sun God will be breaking 
from tradition and beginning at 2 p.m., rather 
than the standard 12 p.m. starting time. Zhang 
said the office made the adjustment to tighten 
the budget.

“We wanted to make every act on the 
lineup reach out to a base of people,” Zhang 
said. “It made the talent budget more compact 
so that we could spend more money on certain 
artists. That really contributed to making this 
year’s lineup stand out a lot more.”

Additionally, the overcrowding of the dance 
tent last year — which resulted in police shut-
ting down the stage at the end of DJ Z-Trip’s 
set — has been remedied by a new type of tent 
that will be easier for students to enter and exit.

“It’s not going to be the tent anymore — it’s 
going to be a different structure,” Zhang said. 
“It will allow for more student to be in there, 
though it will still be a closed space.”

In an effort to get more UCSD students into 
the festival, guest ticket prices have gone up, 
while their number has gone down.  There will 
be 3,000 guest tickets (500 less than last year’s 
festival) for sale at $50 — an increase from the 
$41 tickets last year — beginning April 11. 

Guest tickets must be purchased by a UCSD 
student or employee, with a limit of two tickets 
per person. Last year, the guest tickets sold out 
two and a half weeks after they went on sale.

Student wristbands will be available for 
pick-up beginning the Thursday before the 
event. Zhang is confident this year’s lineup will 
help the festival sell out for the third time in 
its history. 

In 2008, wristbands sold out the day before 
the festival, while last year students were 
turned away after 2:30 p.m. the day of. The 
2009 festival did not sell out. 

The deadline for students interested in 
playing the Midway stage and for organization 
booths is April 15 while the deadline for stu-
dent art displays is April 22.

 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 8THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 2011WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/FOCUS

J asmine Phillips might just be the woman to help A.S. Council turn a new leaf. The Sixth College senior wants to make the office on the 
fourth floor of Price Center a place for all students 
and engage a wider share of the student popula-
tion — and if she could do so while locking down 
Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu or Trey Songz for Sun 
God, all the better.

Like most of us, Phillips spent a while bounc-
ing around various academic interests: the one-
time psychology major and classical studies minor 
entered UCSD with dreams of studying abroad 
in Greece or Italy, though shifting interests and 
extensive on-campus involvement put the brakes 
on those plans. Phillips dabbled in political science 
before switching course to critical gender studies 
and sociology, with a minor in human rights. These 
areas of study have tested her well beyond finals 
week. 

“When you start looking at how everything is 
constructed, it makes it hard for you to watch a 
commercial, watch a TV show, listen to Lil’ Wayne 
… so that’s always something I challenge myself 
with,” Phillips said. “I own my contradictions, and I 
try not to judge anyone else in their process.”

Phillips said her education has also informed 
her leadership style. Critical gender studies (CGS) 
courses, in particular, have pushed her to ques-
tion how success is realized and how leadership is 
performed, which Phillips said carries over to the 
Students First slate: The candidates comprise not so 
much a top-to-bottom hierarchy as a collective of 
hopeful leaders whose opinions hold equal weight. 
In presenting the Students First platform to campus 
organizations, Phillips said, it’s never assumed that 
she’ll be the one to dominate discussion; any and all 
candidates are welcome to step up and take center 
stage. 

Her fields of choice have also shaped Phillips’ 
vision of her future.

“If anything, CGS has enabled me to look at 
how I don’t necessarily have to be an ‘ultra career 
woman’ to be a feminist — it’s just repeating a sys-
tem,” Phillips said. 

Whether she fits the suit-sporting feminist 
archetype or not, Phillips still boasts an impres-
sive campus resume — one that spans an array 
of everything from college council to Students 
for Affirmative Action Committee (SAAC). The 

A nyone looking at the extracurricular activi-ties of Warren College junior Alyssa Wing might just see a pattern. 
She’s served on Warren College Student Council 

since her freshman year, and is currently president 
of the 60-strong organization that saw the college 
snag the Spirit Night title this year. She sat through 
six-hour A.S. Council last year as Warren Senator, 
working on issues of visibility and occasionally being 
shouted at by both the public and her fellow student 
leader hot heads. And on the side, she’s had stints 
as Warren orientation leader, Warren Ambassador, 
Warren Briefs columnist, Warren student orienta-
tion and represented the face of Warren at student 
events. 

Needless to say, Wing breathes Warren College 
and school spirit and now —  as the titular member 
of second-year slate Board the Wing — she wants to 
take that straight to the top.

“Warren is my home base,” she said. “But, having 
worked on A.S., I know the potential it has to  be 
better. I haven’t seen it be capitalized, seen A.S. be 
built from year to year and I want to take it in a new 
direction with a new spirit.”

Spirit is the catchword here; Wing’s track record 
is based on student life, particularly supporting ath-
letics, whether through working with Triton Tide, 
creating peppy banners or bullying councilmembers 
into attending sports games. Now, with D-I up in 
the air, she’s a staunch supporter of a move she says 
should be seen as an investment.

“I absolutely support the move to D-I and, more 
important, as a student, I support athletics,” she said. 
“I support what athletics provides; it’s allowed me to 
find a connection and unifying pride, and I think 
this move could really bolster spirt and pride.”

And like every candidate, she’s interested in 
updating the students about their famously “inac-
cessible” student leaders. She want to reform council 
from the inside out with new committees to increase 
consistency in council’s rules, as well as institute an 
A.S. table on Library Walk and work with Triton 
Television and taking on social media interns to 
provide a live feed of the Wednesday night meetings.

“Students complain about how A.S. could be 
enforcing rules for one organization but not another, 
so there needs to be someone to ensure that our 
councilmembers are updating our own rules,” she 
said. 

A Newport Beach native with a politician’s winning smile, Ryan O’Rear might seem a more natural fit for an “O.C.” bit part 
than the fourth floor of Price Center East. Looks, 
however, can be deceiving: O’Rear’s an old hand 
on council, having already served two years as 
Muir College senator with current running mate 
Lynne Swerhone. 

O’Rear’s hasn’t necessarily been the loudest 
voice on the council floor the past two years, but 
he has made an effort to reach out to constituents 
from the ground up. With Swerhone, he hosted a 
weekly radio show called “Muirworld” on KSDT, 
which served to inform listeners (mostly his and 
Swerhone’s friends, O’Rear admits, though he 
says he’s grateful for their devotion all the same) 
of current topics of debate. 

Only around 30 listeners typically tuned in to 
the program, but working with KSDT and meet-
ing his fellow DJs connected O’Rear to a corner 
of campus that might not otherwise have been 
very in touch with the type-A decision makers 
hiding up in PC East. That kind of base-level 
outreach exemplifies O’Rear’s goals for next year 
— aims that all come back to engendering pride 
in our campus.  

“I want students to remember their four or 
five years at UCSD not as, ‘oh, I went to UCSD 
when fees were increased by 50 percent,’” O’Rear 
said. ”I want students to be able to come back 
and donate with a sense of pride … I want alum-
ni to come back and support the UCSD students 
of the future.”

As president, the Tritons First candidate 
would also hope to get more in touch with 
the students themselves — though he certainly 
knows better than to expect anyone to march 
to the fourth floor during office hours. Instead, 
O’Rear hopes to have lunch at Price Center with 
a different student every day — a proposal that 
could, granted, provide for more onion rings and 
orange chicken than one stomach should ever 
handle, but all in the righteous name of keeping 
the council’s ear to the ground. 

The Muir College junior is strongly in favor 
of making the leap to DIV-I sports, though he

FOCUS THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 

J asmine Phillips might just be the woman to help A.S. Council turn a new leaf. The Sixth College senior wants to make the office on the 
fourth floor of Price Center a place for all students 
and engage a wider share of the student popula-
tion — and if she could do so while locking down 
Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu or Trey Songz for Sun 
God, all the better.

Like most of us, Phillips spent a while bounc-
ing around various academic interests: the one-
time psychology major and classical studies minor 
entered UCSD with dreams of studying abroad 
in Greece or Italy, though shifting interests and 
extensive on-campus involvement put the brakes 
on those plans. Phillips dabbled in political science 
before switching course to critical gender studies 
and sociology, with a minor in human rights. These 
areas of study have tested her well beyond finals 
week. 

“When you start looking at how everything is 
constructed, it makes it hard for you to watch a 
commercial, watch a TV show, listen to Lil’ Wayne 
… so that’s always something I challenge myself 
with,” Phillips said. “I own my contradictions, and I 
try not to judge anyone else in their process.”

Phillips said her education has also informed 
her leadership style. Critical gender studies (CGS) 
courses, in particular, have pushed her to ques-
tion how success is realized and how leadership is 
performed, which Phillips said carries over to the 
Students First slate: The candidates comprise not so 
much a top-to-bottom hierarchy as a collective of 
hopeful leaders whose opinions hold equal weight. 
In presenting the Students First platform to campus 
organizations, Phillips said, it’s never assumed that 
she’ll be the one to dominate discussion; any and all 
candidates are welcome to step up and take center 
stage. 

Her fields of choice have also shaped Phillips’ 
vision of her future.

“If anything, CGS has enabled me to look at 
how I don’t necessarily have to be an ‘ultra career 
woman’ to be a feminist — it’s just repeating a sys-
tem,” Phillips said. 

Whether she fits the suit-sporting feminist 
archetype or not, Phillips still boasts an impres-
sive campus resume — one that spans an array 
of everything from college council to Students 
for Affirmative Action Committee (SAAC). The 

P arminder Sandhu is an everyman’s candidate — most of the third year’s Facebook statuses are alerts about free food available somewhere 
on campus. 

Back in his second year, Sandhu applied this 
“one for all” attitude to his new position as Advocate 
General on A.S. council, charged with impeaching 
members that had too many absences. As Advocate 
General, Sandhu, who tried to impeach then-Presi-
dent Elect Wafa Ben Hassine, was all about fairness. 

“I’m like the guy in Green Eggs and Ham,” 
Sandhu said at an April 2010 A.S. Council meeting. 
“I will talk about impeachments with you on a boat, 
on a house, on the sea.”

Now, as a Sixth College senator, Sandhu is still a 
stickler for the rules.  Throughout the year, his main 
focuses have been improving life for Sixth College 
transfers, working on an Indian cultural celebration 
(set to occur sometime this quarter) and the Sixth 
College student parking controversy.

“A lot of what students complain to me about, 
more than anything, are the parking spots being 
removed from Sixth College,” Sandhu said. 
“Basically, it’s a safety concern because it’s forcing 
students to park near the baseball fields and it’s a 
long walk with no lighting. It’s really a safety issue.”

In between working to meet with administration 
on parking issues, studying for a double degree in 
bionengineering and political science and partici-
pating in organizations like Relay for Life, Sandhu 
has been working on his slate’s platform, hammering 
out the main issues they plan on targeting next year 
— if they win. His slate, WE ARE TRITONS (which 
he founded) also mirrors the candidate’s goals by 
bringing together a mix of campus representatives 
from a wide variety of organizations and colleges — 
including students from A.S. Council, Greek life and 
club athletes.

“I wanted to create as much of a microcosm 
of UCSD as possible,” Sandhu said. “People with  
different viewpoints, with different majors, from 
different student orgs, with goals like improving 
education and building a sense of community and 
improving transportation on campus.”

WE ARE TRITONS also presents a focus on 
student education.

 “With all the budget cuts, we’ve already closed 
the medical library and are projected to close CLICS 
and some other libraries,” Sandhu said. “These are 

F or all the other candidates’ talk about transparency, it’s Warren College junior John Tran — the sole contender without 
prior council experience — that has the simplest 
plan for improving student life. He wants to 
bring puppies, Muse and the cast of “Glee” to 
UCSD. (And not a whole lot else.)

Tran, who’s double majoring in history and 
communications, may not have any political 
experience, but he’s also no stranger to student 
involvement. He’s been keeping busy since his 
sophomore year, when he joined Programming 
at Warren and helped plan events and allocate 
funds for Warren College students.

 Since then, Tran’s also played an active role 
in the Inter-College Residents Association, for 
which he serves as the Vice President of Public 
Relations. 

Even more recently, he’s joined UCSD Cares, 
an organization that works to raise money for 
and recognize other philanthropic UCSD orga-
nizations.

“He’s very committed to what he does,” said 
Warren College junior Tyler Nelson, who’s run-
ning for Vice President of External Affairs on 
Tran’s slate. “He’s not so strong-headed to do 
only what he wants to do. He’s not going to shut 
anyone down. He’s a very amiable guy.”

Tran and Nelson want to keep the focus on 
students. Their campaign has been centered on 
the simple focus of the Flush the John vision: 
creating a better Sun God.

“We just came together and we basically 
wanted to start off simple,” Tran said. “Make a 
better Sun God, bring the ‘Glee’ cast, bring Muse. 
It’s definitely grown into something. We want to 
see if we can change A.S. from the inside.”

While he hasn’t been to any A.S. Council 
meetings, Tran said he’s been doing his research, 
and has a pretty keen idea of what he wants 
changed. 

First, he’s hoping to get rid of A.S. resolutions 
— statements that go before a council vote and 
are said to define UCSD’s stance on a campus or 
political issue. 

“Some of the resolutions in the past have been 
really unfair,” Tran said. “They don’t represent all 
UCSD students. I’ve been going to the A.S. web-
site and looking over things, and I was against

THIS YEAR’S CANDIDATE ROSTER spans a wide range of  students with 
equally divergent pedigrees: While some have taken root in their respective 
college councils, others have formed themselves as leaders through the SAAC 
community or Greek life. And with a $500-million cut in state funding (as well 
as a $3-million hit that will almost certainly give way to library closures come 
fall), these presidential hopefuls already have next year’s work cut out for them.

made an effort to cast his vote with 
those he represents chief in mind.

“When I’m voting, I don’t 
always maybe personally agree 
with the votes that I cast, but I 
know that if my constituents do, if 
the people I’m representing do, I 
can rest easily,” O’Rear said.

Outside his dedication to Muir, 
O’Rear’s also an active member of 
Tau Kappa Epsilon, and served as 
the fraternity’s treasurer during his 
freshman year. 

While O’Rear’s experience in 
fraternity leadership has been col-
ored by an admittedly more lax 
environment than the fourth floor, 
collecting quarterly membership 
dues from some of his best friends 
has certainly informed his leader-
ship style. 

“[As president,] I wouldn’t be 
trying to make everyone be my 
best friend, but it’s working with 
everyone on a level where you 
respect everyone outside of A.S.,” 
O’Rear said. “It’s working with 
them on a personal level to make 
sure that everything goes through 
as smoothly as possible.”

Making everybody happy, in the 
end, is the name of O’Rear’s game. 
Whether this week’s election works 
out in his favor or not, the spring 
climate should encourage some of 
his favorite pastimes. O’Rear’s a 
seasoned volleyball player, and — a 
So Cal boy through and through — 
is seldom more content than when 
he’s at the beach.

MANAGING EDITOR

This year, as a non-voting mem-
ber of council, she’s taken those 
first steps by attending nearly every 
meeting and researching a student-
fee referendum from 30 years ago 
that sets money aside for college 
councils —  a referendum she says 
council has been violating.

All of these synthesizes with 
Wing’s self-declared love of people. 
As a first-generation college student 
from Rancho Santa Margarita, Wing 
said her background created her 
drive to succeed and that meant the 
“very pre-business” student entered 
UCSD as an economics major. 

But two quarters in, she realized 
that she didn’t want to continue and, 
on a friend’s suggestion, took a com-
munications class instead.

“After that first one, I realized 
I was really drawn to the study of 
people, to work with people, to 
think about the most basic aspects 
of people, whether that’s speech or 
dress — it was more in tune with me, 
writing was better than math, and 
I later added sociology as a double 
major,” she said. 

It’s this emphasis on people that 
has made Wing so eager to reach 
out, and made her rank winning 
Spirit Night this year as one of her 
all-time highlights. 

“I remember my freshman year 
we didn’t even have Spirit night, and 
to go to what we have, it’s a testament 
to our students,  what we’re capable 
of together and what I want to con-
tinue,” she said.

Long Beach native has served as a 
SAAC rep on both the Black Student 
Union and Sixth College Council, 
and currently interns on campus at 
the Cross Cultural Center (CCC), 
where she serves as affiliates and 
outreach coordinator. 

This year, Phillips went above 
and beyond her intern responsibili-
ties to organize January’s Kiamsha 
Community Conference for the 
CCC. Kiamsha — which translates 
from Swahili as “that which awak-
ens me” — focused on empowering 
student leaders of color through the 
importance of self-care. That lesson 
is one that, ironically, Phillips could 
probably take closer to heart herself: 
working an average of 30-40 hours 
per week between the CCC and 
campus box office while managing 
a double major doesn’t always leave 
much time for scrupulous self-main-
tenance, let alone a full night’s sleep. 

The hard work is bound to pay 
off: a first-generation college stu-
dent, Phillips plans to pursue law 
school after graduation. In the 
meantime, her involvement on cam-
pus and the rigor of her coursework 
— which demands far more than 
mindless essay writing or an endless 
game of memorization — keep the 
student leader plenty occupied.

“In a class where you’re talking 
about how you can’t fundamental-
ize everything, it’s hard to provide 
a solution,” Phillips said. “There’s 
no right answer — that’s always a 
challenge.”

hard facts that we have to deal with.  
We have to work with the adminis-
tration to make sure the core educa-
tional and student experience isn’t 
compromised. These cuts need to 
be made with more of a student 
perspective in mind, rather than a 
budgetary one.”

Like his political role model, 
Barack Obama, Sandhu wasn’t 
expecting to run for the presidential 
seat when he first started in gov-
ernment, though he’s been working 
hard towards his goal since making 
the decision this past winter. And 
though Sandhu describes President 
Obama as a “very inspirational per-
son,” Sandhu’s biggest motivator is a 
little closer to home.

“In middle school, my mom was 
hit by a drunk driver and she was 
paralyzed from the waist down,” 
Sandhu said. “That made me want 
to get more involved in my com-
munity and really make a positive 
change. Though it happened a while 
ago, it still inspires me to do good in 
the world and do the best I can in 
everything I do.”

And while A.S. Council is known 
for incessant bickering, the presi-
dential hopeful isn’t worried about 
council divisions.

“We should be in the business of 
improving the student life experi-
ence on campus,” Sandhu said.  “As 
long as we understand that we’re in 
the business of improving student 
life, we can disagree on some aspects 
while coming together on others.”

the resolutions when I read about 
them in the Guardian. I thought, 
‘Why are they staying up until 4 
a.m. discussing these things?’”

Tran says his main focus would 
be on the students, and wants 
council to reduce funding for 
conferences and councilmember 
stipends, instead funneling those 
resources toward events benefit-
ting student life, such as pancake 
breakfasts and — one of the chief 
tenets of Tran’s campaign — more 
puppies.

“We think puppies are big stress 
relievers,” Tran said. “We know a 
lot of UCSD students are stressed 
as it is. More puppies on campus 
will make them a lot happier.”

Tran’s lack of experience may 
make him the object of criticism 
from naysayers, but he’s prepared 
to take the heat. 

“Most people in UCSD aren’t 
familiar with what A.S. does, 
either,” Tran said. “I would repre-
sent those people. I feel like not 
everyone has a voice in A.S. Most 
of them really don’t care what A.S. 
does. If we give students what they 
want, that makes a happier cam-
pus.” 

And, for Tran, it’s all in the 
name. “Flush the John” reflects the 
light-heartedness Tran hopes to 
bring to council.

“I’m kind of a comic relief,” he 
said. “I think that A.S. needs to 
lighten up a little. They’re kind of 
serious — that doesn’t make it fun.”

An Open Letter To Our University Community  
About Troubling Hypocrisy On Our Campus

The past few months have witnessed historic political unrest engulfing Arab and Muslim countries in the Mideast, including Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Iran, Yemen, Bahrain 
and others. On our campus the muted reaction to this volcanic eruption of civil unrest and the ensuing horrific slaughter of thousands of civilians by their own leaders 
has been quite revealing. Sadly, it has confirmed strong suspicions of many students and faculty that the highly vituperative activism spearheaded by the Muslim Students 
Association (MSA), the Arab Student Union (ASU) and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and directed relentlessly against a single Mideast country, Israel, is driven less 
by positive impulses of fraternity toward fellow Arabs and Muslims than by hateful impulses to destroy the world’s only sovereign Jewish nation.  

The current maelstrom in the Mideast has laid bare for all to see the reality that, by any objective measure, the greatest human rights abuses suffered by the greatest number 
of Muslims and Arabs have been inflicted by the despotic regimes of the Mideast’s 17 Arab countries and Iran, and not, as the MSA, ASU and SJP would have us believe, 
by Israel, the only country in the entire region consistently rated by Freedom House International as bestowing full civil and political liberties upon its Jewish and Arab 
citizens. 

So, if hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims have suffered severe, long-standing repression throughout the Mideast, as is now highly evident, why then 
have those students who relentlessly pounce on every action and policy of Israel—which comprises 0.04% of the Mideast—been deafeningly silent all these years 
regarding the egregious injustices occurring in the other 99.96% of the Mideast? Why haven’t the websites and Facebook pages of the MSA, ASU and SJP been abuzz 
with plans for social activism and moral outrage over the murder of civilians who are fighting to gain liberty in Arab countries as they always are when Israel exercises 
self-defense by striking at Palestinian terrorist groups who launch rockets at its civilians from Gaza or when it erects barriers to block suicide bombers? Are those students 
simply less moved by injustices carried out by Arabs and Muslims against their own people? Or is it possible that human rights and social justice have been hijacked by 
these groups for use as expedient intellectual weapons in the service of a culturally driven agenda—to bludgeon the Jewish state? In this regard we do well to heed the 
assertion of Palestinian journalist Khaled Abu Toameh, “What is happening on the U.S. campuses is not about supporting the Palestinians as much as it is about promoting 
hatred for the Jewish state” and “ending the existence of Israel.” 

Critical debate is a cherished mainstay of universities, and Israel should, by no means, be above reproach. As a small and isolated democratic nation in a highly volatile 
geopolitical environment, some of its actions and policies will surely be considered misguided by fair-minded citizens of other nations, as they are by many Israeli 
citizens—a fact reflected in Israel’s vibrant free press. However, as pointed out by Natan Sharansky, the respected Israeli human rights activist and former Soviet 
political prisoner, one test of malevolently motivated criticism of Israel is the “double standards” test—criticism of Israel that is applied selectively.

In a few weeks our campus will, once again, witness the flagship event in the Israel-bashing calendar: the weeklong hate-fest whose centerpiece is a wall on Library Walk 
that promulgates deliberately one-sided and selective information and inflammatory descriptive terms to provoke the moral indignation of students and convince them 
that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be simply reduced to egregious Israeli misdeeds visited upon totally innocent Palestinians. Nearby we can expect the usual mock 
cemetery (commemorating Palestinian casualties exclusively) to offer emotive reinforcement of that message. Anticipate our university community to, once again, become 
polarized over the event. 

However, this does not have to be the case. The organizers of the acrimonious and divisive spring event have a golden opportunity this year to show that they are 
genuinely interested in the rights and dignity of all the people of the Mideast by expanding their focus beyond the tiny Jewish state and, in so doing, put on an 
event that will do more to unite our campus than divide it. Will they rise to the occasion? Will they hold candlelight vigils and establish mock cemeteries also for the 
Arabs who have been recently massacred by their own leaders? Will they—dare we dream it—find a way to commemorate the innocent Israelis who have been murdered 
by Palestinian terrorists, like the 3 young children and their parents who were brutally stabbed to death in their sleep a few weeks ago? Will these student organizations 
sponsor an A.S. resolution this year calling for UCSD to divest from the many Muslim countries stained by egregious human rights practices, such as Saudi Arabia, where 
women are not allowed to vote or to drive and where public practice of any religion other than Islam is prohibited, or Iran, where homosexuals are executed by the state 
decree? Or, as they have in past years, will these human rights crusaders selectively sponsor initiatives against Israel, a country where Arab women sit as elected members 
in Parliament, where gay men and women serve openly in the military and hold annual gay pride parades in Tel Aviv and where Christians, Jews, Muslims, Baha’is and 
others freely practice their religions under full protection of Israeli law? Will the SJP decide this year to fully embrace its mission statement, “to promote justice, human 
rights, and the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people,” by also raising awareness of how Palestinians in Gaza are denied political freedom by the ruling 
Hamas government, which suspended democratic elections indefinitely after it consolidated power through force of arms? Will it call on Hamas, recognized as a terrorist 
organization by the U.S. and E.U., to remove from its official charter overtly anti-Semitic quotes from Islamic religious texts, recognize Israel’s right to exist and put a stop 
to rocket attacks on Israeli civilians? Or will SJP just continue to apologize for Hamas while relentlessly hammering Israel? 

Absent these changes, students of good will should ask themselves if this event and the others like it are sincerely designed to educate and raise their awareness, or if 
they are being subjected to a cynical exploitation of human rights for a sinister agenda. Advocacy that deliberately distorts and omits information to convince others 
of a partisan viewpoint, that uses calculated, inflammatory rhetoric to demonize a nation, its citizens and its supporters, may be protected as free speech but should 
nevertheless be scorned by fair-minded students as a form of intellectual abuse. As the Liberal Party leader of Canada, where the first anti-Israel hate week took place, 
recently asserted, “By portraying the Jewish state as criminal, by demonizing Israel and its supporters…the organizers and supporters of Israeli Apartheid Week tarnish our 
freedom of speech.”

SPORTS THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 15 

too much, he put the attackers in situations to be suc-
cessful and they executed. That’s the key right there, 
so I thought he did a really nice job. The middles hit 
for a high efficiency and Calvin Ross was a beast of a 
blocker. He was the guy that actually stopped that ball, 
he had a really big night for us. “

The match against UCLA marks Ring’s 50th win 
at UCSD and was made even more impressive since 
the win was on the heels of the April 1 home match 
when the Tritons got swept by the Bruins. Set scores 
were 25-21, 25-21 and 25-22. With this win, UCSD 
improves to 9-17 overall and 5-14 in the MPSF.

“Even early in the game that was it, it was our game 
to win,” Ring said. “And we did a great job. When we 
had that lead late in the game, we just closed it out. We 
just went out and made the play and that’s a nice win 
out on the road; we’ve been very competitive on the 
road this season. To walk into someone else’s gym, get 
yourself prepared, and know a game player, we did a 
good job of that.”

The Tritons have two more away games, with a trip 
to Cal State Northridge on April 7 and Cal State Long 
Beach on April 9. The team will return to RIMAC Arena 
on Saturday, April 16 at 7 p.m. against UC Irvine.

Deyna Roberson, junior Caitlin Meagher and 
senior Kelly Fogarty ran 3:46.17 to blow away 
the field by nearly 10 seconds. The 4x100 
team — consisting of Meagher, Fogarty, junior 
Jaqueline Rose and sophomore Kathleen 
Hitchens — came in at 46.77, just behind Cal 
State Dominguez Hill’s time of 46.59. Both 
relay times were improvements on NCAA 
provisional qualifying marks. 

Meagher also took first in the 400-meter 
hurdles with a time of 62.90, and Hitchens 
was second in the 100-meter dash with a time 
of 12.48. 

The men’s side also had success with the 
field events, as all five Triton victories came in 
the field. Junior Nick Howe — the defending 
national champion in the javelin — won the 
high jump with a mark of 6’1.25”. Freshman 
Clint Rosser’s mark of 14’10.75” was good 
enough to win the pole vault, and junior Ka 
Wai Ng won the triple jump with a leap of 
46’11”. 

Sophomore Ryan Eckert won the shot put, 

edging out Triton alumnus Fred Cook with 
his mark of 48’10”. Junior Ab Shaheen was 
victorious in the hammer throw with a mark 
of 179’6”. 

Overall, Ahner was pleased with the team’s 
performance, especially coming off one of the 
higher-profile meets of the year in the Cal-
Nevada Championships a week ago.

“Having so many wins is always such a 
great sign from a team standpoint,” Ahner said. 
“And coming off of Cal-Nevada, sometimes 
the athletes can come out kind of flat because 
that is such a key, high-energy performance. 
We showed that we can come off of that and 
still be really strong.”

Any Triton with an NCAA automatic or 
provisional qualifier will travel to Arizona 
State on Saturday for the Sun Angel Track 
Classic, while the rest of the team will compete 
at the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational on the same 
day.

ence opponents and it will not affect 
UCSD’s position in the conference 
championship.

After taking finals week off and 
spending spring break practicing, the 
Tritons flew to Hawaii March 25-26 
to take on perennial powerhouses 
No. 11 San Diego State and No. 5 
Hawaii, and also faced off against 
conference opponent Cal State East 
Bay. Though keeping it close against 
the Aztecs, the Tritons fell to their 
more aggressive adversary 10-6, and 
were blown out of the water by the 
Warriors 13-4.

The Tritons were mired in a six-
game losing streak, and were looking 
to notch a victory to kick them out 
of their lull. They found their chance 
going up against Cal State East Bay, 
their closest competition to the sec-
ond seed in the conference. To begin 
the match, the Tritons scored five 
unanswered goals and never looked 
back. They pulled to a 5-0 lead in 
the first seven minutes of the match, 
before the Pioneers scored with just 
under a minute in the first quarter. 
Both teams traded goals in the sec-
ond quarter to leave the score at 6-2 
to end the first half. 

The Triton scoring slowed in the 
second half, but they played lights out 
defense and matched Cal State East 
Bay goal for goal, rolling through the 
second half of a critical conference 
game. The win moved the Tritons to 
6-1 in conference and 9-14 overall, 
and helped keep the Tritons ahead of 
Cal State East Bay in the standings.

“At this point it’s all about putting 
yourself in the best position come the 
tournament,” Kreutzkamp said. 

UCSD moved back to No. 20 in 
the rankings with the win and took 
the momentum into Friday’s match 
against unranked Brown University. 
The Tritons jumped out to an early 
4-1 lead after the first quarter, and 
went into the half with a 7-4 lead. 
Brown closed the gap to 7-5, early 
in the third quarter, but UCSD still 
went into the fourth quarter with an 
11-6 advantage. 

But the Bears came out hot in 
fourth quarter, and scored twice to 
trail 11-8 with three minutes left. 
But UCSD didn’t allow another score 
until 49 seconds remaining, and held 
on for the win despite not scoring in 
the final stanza.  

The Tritons also took on Fresno 
Pacific and No. 9 Arizona State 
on Sunday at Canyonview Pool.

Thursday’s issue of The Guardian.

TENNIS — It’s been a busy few weeks for 
the UCSD men’s tennis team, which con-
tinued its undefeated season. The team won 
two more matches in the past two weeks, 
raising its record to 15-0.

This recent run started with a 5-4 defeat 
of Barry University, with senior Erik Elliot 
winning his singles match as well as his 
doubles match with sophomore Austin 
West to give the Tritons two points. West, 
along with senior Vincent Nguyen and 
freshman Max Jiganti, won their singles 
matches to give the Tritons the victory.

A day later, the team defeated Hawaii 
Pacific 6-3. West, Nguyen, Jiganti once 
again won their singles matches along with 
junior Sam Ling, while Elliott and West and 
juniors Chapman Chan and Jason Wall won 
their doubles matches.

One day later, the Tritons crushed 
Lafayette College 9-0 for an easy victory. 
Elliot, Ling and Jiganti needed three sets to 
win the number one, three and five singles 
matches, while the rest of the players won 
their matches with relative ease.

On March 25, the Tritons took on 
Sonoma State, who were 0-8 entering the 
match and it was no contest. “I was very 
happy we came back competitively after a 
long layoff,” head coach Eric Steidlmayer 
said.

Finally, the Tritons defeated Western 
New Mexico 8-1, to improve its record 
15-0, the best start of Steidlmayer’s 13-year 
tenure. Elliot, West and Chan continued 
their impressive seasons with victories. 
Western New Mexico’s only point came 
from Rodrigo Almeida, who won the num-
ber four singles match over Ling. The 
doubles matches were competitive, with 

the Tritons winning all three at scores of 
9-7, 9-7, 8-5.

The team is currently ranked No. 24 
and has a long layover until its next match, 
which takes place Wednesday, April 13 
against Concordia Irvine at UCSD.

The women’s tennis team defeated Cal 
State Stanislaus 6-3, before hitting the road 
for two matches. Senior Cindy Dao con-
tinued her superb season, winning both 
the no. 2 two singles and no. 2 doubles 
matches. Dao’s doubles partner, sophomore 
Jacquelyn Davis, also won the no. 6 singles 
match. The doubles team of junior Katie 
Mulloy and Roxanna Pourmirzaie won 
their doubles match as well. Mulloy also 
won the no. 5 singles match.

“The team played tough at all positions,” 
head coach Liz LaPlante said. 

LaPlante added that she was pleased 
with the team’s effort, given that several 
players were injured and unable to practice 
leading up to the match.

On Friday and Saturday, the Tritons 
defeated Sonoma State and Cal State 
Stanislaus again, winning on the road 5-4 
for both matches, pushing their winning 
streak to four matches. Against Sonoma 
State, Dao once again led the way, with 
Mulloy, Davis and junior Samantha Yeung 
providing singles victories, while Dao and 
Davis clinched the match by winning their 
doubles match.

Against Cal State Stanislaus, Dao, 
Yeung, Mulloy and Davis all won their 
singles matches, while Pourmirzaie and 
Mulloy clinched the victory by winning 
their doubles match. The team is currently 
ranked No .17 in the nation, with four more 
matches before post-season play.

Readers can contact Jonathan Kaslow at 
jkaslow@ucsd.edu.

The men’s team is still unbeaten at 15-0 while the women’s team has won four 
straight, and the teams are now ranked No. 20 and No.17, respectively.

Both Ranked, Tennis Teams Continue on Hot Streaks

CREW — The UCSD men’s and women’s crew 
teams both had strong showings at the 38th 
annual San Diego Crew Classic this weekend, 
The Crew Classic draws programs across the 
nation for the two-day event held at Mission 
Bay, including powerhouses such as Cal and 
Stanford.

The highlight of the weekend was UCSD 
men’s varsity “A” boat, which advanced to 
the finals of the prestigious Copley Cup. Not 
only was this a program-first for UCSD, but 
the Tritons also became the first Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association represen-
tative and first San Diego area school in 
the final. The boat — consisting of Shawn 
Kuo, Edwin Clement, Drew Lawyer, Brandon 
Gonzalez, Joey Frank, Erik Smith, Brandon 
Sparks, Justin Gordon and Drew Madden —  
finished the race in 6:01.57 to take third place 
and qualify for the final. The Tritons finished 
just .5 seconds behind second-place Temple 
in their heat.

In the final on Sunday, UCSD didn’t have 
quite as good a run with a fifth-place finish in 
6:13.20. Cal edged Stanford to get the victory 
in 5:54.90. 

UCSD’s varsity “B” boat took third place 
in the prelims of the Sharp Cabrillo Cup to 
qualify for the Sunday final. The Tritons fin-
ished in 6:13.73, only .02 back of second-place 
Oregon State. The boat finished in 6:17.25 in 
the final to take fifth place. 

The novice eight boat also had a good 
weekend, taking first in their heat of the pre-
lims for the Derek Guelkar Memorial Cup. 

The Tritons finished fourth in the final on 
Sunday, while Cal ran away with the race to 
get another win.

On the women’s side, two boats advanced 
to Sunday finals. The varsity eight took sec-
ond in their heat of the San Diego Zoo and 
Safari Park Cup on Saturday, recording a time 
of 7:21.71. The Tritons had a tough time in the 
final, however, dropping to 7:42.84 to finish in 
fifth place. 

“At this regatta, the team was kind of able 
to put it all together and execute their racing 
plan in a really challenging environment,” 
head coach Patti Pinkerton said. “There’s 
50,000 people there, its on the Jumbotron, 
the races are televised; so they just did a ter-
rific job.”

UCSD’s varsity “B” boat qualified for the 
petite final on Sunday, despite racing against 
the other top boats in the prelims. The Tritons 
took third place in the final heat with a time 
of 7:56.48, despite the crew from Long Beach 
State veering into UCSD’s lane. 

“They [the “B” boat] did not have a good 
race on Saturday,” Pinkerton said. “And they 
were pretty disappointed. The second var-
sity just did such a great job of turning their 
boat around. And Julie Montes, a senior, was 
stroke for the second varsity, and I think her 
leadership and the entire boat should be com-
mended for rowing such a poised race.”

The men’s team will travel to the Newport 
Regatta next Saturday, while the women’s 
team returns to action next weekend in a dual 
meet against Loyola Marymount.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The UCSD men’s vol-
leyball team went on the road last week and took 
a hit, losing a match to No. 8 UC Santa Barbara 
0-3 on Thursday, but turned it around and swept 
No. 5 UCLA on Friday.

The difference in performance for the 
Tritons was astounding; against UCSB they hit 
an appalling .075, dipping as low to a negative 
average of -.065 in the third set, but against 
UCLA, the team brought a solid .329 hits. 

“The match against UC Santa Barbara, I felt 
like we just offensively did not connect very well 

in that combination of connection between set-
ter and attackers, with our middle hitter, with 
our left side or right side attacker,” UCSD head 
coach Kevin Ring said. “But we came out and we 
still did some things really well. We passed really 
well and we played decent defense. We said, OK, 
we know we have to play better offensively, so we 
took the things we did well last night and said, 
let’s just do that again [against UCLA].”

The Gauchos collected 40 kills while the 
Tritons trailed at 24. The next night UCSD 
showed 39 kills to the Bruins’ 34. The match 
against the Bruins saw some less-seasoned play-
ers step up to the challenge, since senior setter 
Phil Bannan was out with an injury. Freshman 

outside hitter Nick Iorfino contributed 11 kills, 
adding two assists and four digs as well, and 
sophomore outside hitter Carl Eberts took 10 
kills and five digs. Junior opposite Shane Veiga 
got eight kills, four digs, and six blocks, and 
senior middle Calvin Ross had seven blocks. 
Freshman setter Mike Brunsting took over for

“Mike Brunsting has played some games as 
setter, some as opposite, and he was running

TRACK & FIELD — Competing against local 
schools at the Mangrum Invitational at Cal State 
San Marcos, the UCSD track and field team had 
several strong results in the non-scoring meet. The 
Tritons performed well despite not fielding a full 
squad and having some athletes compete in “off-
events” that are not necessarily their best events. 

Senior Stephanie LeFever provided the biggest 
highlight of the day for the Tritons, as she broke 
her own school record in the long jump. LeFever 
leaped 20’1” to eclipse 20 feet for the first time in 
her career, and was picked an NCAA Automatic 
Qualifier in the process. Her mark bettered her 
previous record of 19’10.75” that she shared with 
former Triton Whitney Johnson.

“It was a spectacular thing for her,” head wom-
en’s coach Darcy Ahner said. “She’s been staring 
at that 20-foot mark for a long time. She was so 
close last year, and this year she’s been jumping 
consistently 19 this year knowing that it’s there, but 
actually achieving it and getting over that barrier is 
huge. Not too many are in that category.”

 LeFever also placed fourth in the high jump, 
and will compete in the Mt. Sac Heptathlon/
Decathlon Meet on April 13-14. 

“She’s really ready to go in all her events,” Ahner 
said. “She’s really lined up everything beautifully to 
have a great heptathlon performance.”

The Tritons had a good day all around in the 
field events. Senior Erin Langford won the triple 
jump with a mark of 36’9”. Fellow senior Danielle 
Thu destroyed the competition in the hammer 
throw, with her mark of 185’6”, over 25 feet better 
than the second-place mark. Thu also took second 
in the discus with a throw of 138’8”. Freshman Eva 
Isaacs took second in the shot put with a mark of 
39”4.5’. Linda Rainwater — a UCSD graduate that 
competed unattached — tied for first in the high 
jump. 

The Tritons also had a good day in the relay 
events, winning the 4x400 meter relay and nar-
rowly getting clipped by Cal State Dominguez 
Hills to take second in the 4x100 meter relay.

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — The UCSD 
women’s water polo team has been busy 
the past three weeks, playing nine match-
es in that time.

The No. 18 Tritons played conference 
rival Cal State Bakersfield on Friday, 
March 11. With the glare of the Aztec 
Invitational the next day, the Tritons 
played admirably and came out of the 
water with a 14-11 victory. The game was 
a rematch of the last game the Tritons 
played —the final game of the UC Irvine 
Invitational on Feb. 27 — in which the 
Tritons won 13-10. In the rematch, the 
Tritons and Roadrunners traded goals for 
much of the game as neither team led by 
more than two for the first three quarters 
of the game. However, with a series of 
steals and by taking advantage of fast 
break opportunities, the Tritons pulled 
away in the fourth quarter to go 5-1 in 
conference play.

“This is a big win for us because it 
means we won’t have to see Bakersfield 
until well into the [WWPA] tournament,” 
head coach Brad Kreutzkamp said. “Our 
counterattack in the third and fourth 
quarters is what really helped us pull 
away in this game.”

The next day after their game against 
Bakersfield, the Tritons traveled across 
town to partake in the Aztec Invitational 
at San Diego State from March 12-13. 
The Tritons took on Princeton in the 
first match of the morning at 7 a.m., and 
the wear and tear from the night before 
showed, as the Triton defense was slow to 
stop the Tigers from scoring at will. Both 
teams traded goals throughout the game, 
as the game ended in regulation with a 
10-10 draw. 

In overtime, both teams continued 
to trade goals, as the Tritons and Tigers 
scored twice to keep the score tied after 
the first overtime period. In the sec-
ond overtime period, the rules change 
to golden goal, meaning that whoever 
scored first wins outright. Princeton 
managed a goal before the Tritons could 
and took the match.

After the falling to unranked 
Princeton, the Tritons lost in more lop-
sided games to No. 20 ranked Pacific 6-9, 
No. 16 Cal State Northridge 6-9 and No. 
17 Indiana 4-9 to finish out the Aztec 
Invite. After the consecutive losses, the 
Tritons fell out of the rankings, but for-
tunately, no losses were against confer-
