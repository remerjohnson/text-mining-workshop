Mayor 0 'Connor Delivers State of City 
Speech, Declares 'Year of the Child' 

By ERI HAZANKIN 
Associate 

an Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor declared 1989 the "Year 
of the Child" in her annual State 
of the City address on Monday. 

Speaking at the Reuben H. 
leet Space Theater in Balboa 

Park , O'Connor also presented 
her annual State of the ity 
awards, and made eight predic-
tions for San Diego in the coming 
year. 

The theater was filled to capac-
ity and overflow was accommo-
dated in the lobby where TV mon-
itors had been set up to allow 
those unable to be seated the 
opportunity to observe the ad-
dres . 

Reaction to O'Connor's speech 
by those observing it, including 
member of the city council, wa 
generally po itive. 

Although O'Connor did men-
tion several more traditional ' 
themes in the body of her speech, 

of proposal which she aid she 
will place before the city council , 
in an effort to accomplish her 
goals. 

These goals included "a child-
rens' workshop museum and 
academy" in Balboa Park, "a 
landmark children' play struc-
ture," and a new "czar for child-
ren," to "over ee all of the city' 
current youth activities and after-
school recreation program ," as 
well as to coordinate program in 
child care. 

O'Connor also said she would 
propo e "a new Kids Club San 
Diego, which would comprise a 
number of city- and privately-
sponsored programs as igned to 
promote children's activitie in 
the San Diego area. 

To combat drugs and gangs, 
O'Connor also announced that 
she will push for the creation of "a 
metro strike force of 40 police 
offic'!rs to be assigned to the east-
ern and central divi ion ."

thing you think i right. " 

Willie Henderson and Richard 
Minor, two men who fought for 
the creation of a hot dog tand to 
benefi t the Southcre t Litt le 
League, received the second 
award. 

The third award went to 
Councilmember Gloria McColl 
and the Olympic Site Ta k Force, 
for their ucces in having San 
Diego named "an official U.S. 
Olympic training ite." 

The fourth State of the City 
award was given to Glenn Alli-
son, for his work with EpiscopaJ 
Community Services and other 
organizations involved with 
attempts to house the homeless. 
- The final award was given not 
to a San Diegan, but a business 
association, the San Diego 
County Hotel / Motel Association 
for their contribution of $45 
million to Balboa Park renova-
tions "and $33 million to under-
write San Diego's local arts, and 
the coming international arts festi-
val."

uch as police protection, low-
income housing, and her upcom-
ing Soviet Arts Festival, each of 
these was tied into her overall 
theme of creating "a new box car 
full of hope for our children." 

The mayor also announced 
other improvemenL in police ser-
vices, including plans for a com-
puterized reporting system for 
field officers and a new police 
substation at 30th and Imperial 
streets. 

O'Connor pre ented five "State 
of the City" awards, four to indi-
vidual San Diegans and one to a 
business a sociation. 

Student Regent Selection 
Her child-oriented agenda 

included the construction of a 
"space camp" to be built jointly 
by the city of San Diego, the Fleet 
Space Theater, and the Interna-
tional Aero pace Hall of Fame.

Theft Reaches All-Time High 
Car Theft Up 200 Percent From 1986 Figure 

By KENNETH JENSEN

Car theft at UCSD reached an all-time high in 
1988 with the theft of 110 vehicles, a nearly 200 
percent increase ince 1986, according to statis-
tic compiled by the Crime Prevention Office of 
the campu police. 

Police sta tistics show that 38 car were stolen 
in 1986 before the figure nearly doubled to 70 in 
1987. 

A lightly higher number oftheft was reported 
by the Department of Justi e whose figures indi-
cate that 77 car were stolen at U D in 19 7.

Four parking lots are targeted mo t frequently . 
These include Lot 102 by Revelle College and Lot

Wong was selected along with 
Florie Aranovich and Guillermo 
Rodriguez, both of UC Berkeley, 
for the final interview with the 
Regents on Jan. 20. 

Beginning in July, the selected 
student will attend the monthly 
Regent meetings and it on sub-
committees as well. 

Wong said he considered app-
lying for the position last year, 
but decided he needed more expe-
rience and ran for A .S. senator 
in tead. 

A enator, he has been 
involved with the Student Affir-
mative Action Committee and 
the Registration Fee Committee. 

Through his experience, Wong

Wong pointed out that the eth-
nic composition of the UC 
school does not re emble the 
makeup of the entire state, and 
said "UC needs to reaffirm its 
goal" of equal representation. 

He identified three possible 
steps toward this goal: redefining 
racial categories, more active 
recruitment of minority group at 
junior high and high school levels, 
and a greater under tanding of 
why more minorities lea e the 
university before graduation. 

Out of 128 applicants for stu-
dents regent, II semi-finalists were 
interviewed by a Southern Cali-
fornia student panel made up of 
graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents from southern chool , and 
nine by a similar northern panel. 

At that point, UC D had the 
large t number of student partic-
ipating of all scho Is. The semifi-
nali t from UC D were Morde-

Alex Wong. 

The group of 20 was then nar-

UC Irvine Adds American Sign 
Language Classes to Curriculum 

I R VI E - tudents in instructor Denni Galvan'S 
class never listen to what he says, but Galvan doe n't 
mind - as long as they pay attention to what he 
doe . It's the movement of his hand, not the sound of 
his voice, that erve as the key to Galvan's teaching. 

One of the profe ors brought to the University of 
Califonia, Irvine a part of the Student Recom-
mended Faculty Program, Galvan teaches two Amer-
ican ign Language (AS L) classe and one on ASL 
and the Deaf Community. 

When he arrived last fall, Galvan found that twice 
as many tudents wanted to take his class, so a seco nd 
ection of ASL was added . 

Be ides being a language, ASL is a major cultural 
facet of the deaf commu nity, Galvan siad . It is the 
"first language" of deaf children who have deaf par-
ents and is primarily used at home. 

There is some controversy about using ASL in the 
ed ucat ion of deaf children, he said. 

Galvan and many others, however, believe that 
ASL is so important to the deaf community that it 
hould be integrated into the school curriculum. 

"That's what I'm working for," he said. 
Galvan is not deaf, but both his parents lost their 

hearing as a result of being struck with spinal menin-
gitis as children. He became their interpreter when he 
was seven. "I remember the age because that's when 
we got a telephone in t he house." 

U CSB Student Still Missing 
After Tw~ Months of Searching 

SANTA BARBARA - No new leads or informa-
tion have been brought to light regarding the disap-
pearance of UCSB junior Ian Jones, a member of the 
Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity who has been missing 
for nearly two months. 

Jones, 21, apparently left his fraternity house the 
evening of Nov. 20 without saying where he was 
headed and has not been seen since. 

Since the disappearance, fraternity members, Jones' 
father and the police have made several search efforts, 
but have yet to find any clues. 

One fraternity member made an aerial search fllr 
Jones on Dec. 10 that proved fruitless . The fraternity

Increase in Occurence of Rape 
at UCSB of Great Concern 

A TA BAR BAR Despite continuous efforts 
at UCS B to increa e safety precautions and education 
regardi ng sexual assault, seven on-campus rapes have 
been reported to C B Police since February 1987. 

Several campus afety organizations have tressed 
that psychologica l and physical adjustments need to 
be made on the part of both the university and its 
students to combat what UCSB Police Chief John 
MacPherson call "one person's attempt to dominate 
another. " 

According to a 1986 survey conducted at UCSB, 
three to 10 date rape occur at UCSB each week. 
"Our study showed that 25 percent of women said 
they were sexually victimized whi le (attending) 
UCS B," said Rape Prevention and Education Pro-
gram Director Cheri Gurse. 

Of the seven rape reports at UCSB, three were 
alcohol-related and three were incidents of acquain-
tance rape. Ninety percent of rapes that occur on col-
lege campuses are acquaintance rape , as opposed to a 
65 percent national average. 

Part of the problem lies in an inability to see date 
rape a an act of power and aggression instead of a 
sexual act. 

UCSDINFO 
UCSD Med School Offers Stress 
Management Program to Public 

The UCSD School of Medicine's Division of Fam-
ily Medicine will offer a free public orientation to its 
eight-week Stress Management Program at 7 p.m. 

Wed ., Jan . 25, in the UCSD Family Plactice facilit y. 
The building is located on Osler Lane off Gilman 
Drive on the UCSD campus in La Jolla . 

Research over the past 20 years has made it clear 
that the bod y's reaction to stress can be unhealthy 
when the reaction persists over many months or year . 
How people view stressful events and manage the 
resulting stres affects the extent of the stress response 
they suffer. Unle s appropriate lifestyle changes are 
made, they may be prone to depression, worry and 
anger, job related difftcultie , medical problems and 
overuse of drugs and alcohol. 

The Family Medicine Stre s Management Program 
is a multi-level, small-group approach ba ed on scien-
tific research and clinical practice. At the end of the 
cight-week class, participants will have a better under-
standi ng of the sources of stress and the impact of 
stress on feelings and physical health. They will also 
learn methods 0f coping more effectively with the 
emotional and physical consequences of stre s. 

Traditional African Story-Telling 
Interpreted at UCSD Jan. 13 

The African storytelling tradition will be brought to 
UCSD on Jan. 13 when the renowned Children's 
Theatre Company of Minneapolis enacts "Kalulu," 
and African folk tale, and a Swahili narrative ver ion 
of "Rumplestiltskin," at 8 p.m. in the Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

The two tales will be sung and spoken in Swahili by 
an American cast. A narrator will describe in English 
the action taking place and translate the dialog. 

"Kalulu and his Money Farm," is a Shona folk tale 
from Zimbabwe. It tells about a greedy and boastful 
rabbit and how he attempts to fool his king. 

Stories like "Kalulu" were told during celebrations, 
acted out and danced so that they would be remem-
bered. They first were told in the narrative tradition 
of passing the story along from mother to daughter 
and from father to son while doing common daily 
tasks. 

"Rumplestiltskin" is an adaptation of the familiar 
European fairy tale to the African vocal narrative 
tradition. 

Tickets for the performance are $10 for general 
admission, $8 for seniors and $6 for students, and 
may be purchased at the UCSD box office and Tick-
etMaster outlets. The Children's Theatre production 
is brought to San Diego by UCSD's University 
Events Office. 

Stanford String Quartet to 
Perform at Mandeville Jan. 14 

Jazz flutist Hubert Laws will appear with the Stan-
ford String Quartet at 8 p.m. Saturday Jan. 14, in 
Mandeville Auditorium. 

Over a 23-year career, Laws has become as familiar 
with classical music as he is with the jazz idiom. He 
has garnered into his repertoire a compatible mix of 
jazz, rhythm and blues, classical, gospel and pop 
standards. 

Law's live performances span the spectrum of 
music from the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, and 
the New York Philharmonic to the Playboy and 
Montreauz jazz festivals. He has worked sessions with 
Lena Horne, Sergio Mendes, Arthur Prysock and 
Earl Klugh. His distinctive flute stylings can be heard 
on the motion picture sound track from "The Wiz." 

Down Beal magazine's annual readers' poll list has 
put Laws on the top for 10 years, and for the past 
seven years he has been the magazine's critics' choice. 

This event is brought to San Diego by the Univer-
sity Events Office. Tickets are available at the UCSD 
box office and from TicketMaster outlets. General 
admission is $1 1, seniors $9, and students $7.

AUTO: UCSD Plagued by High 
R ate of Car Theft in 1988 
Continued from pale 1 
Toyota Su pra. 

Of the cars stolen on ca mpus in 
1988, Toyota ranked number one 
with 38 stolen. Fords trailed with 
16, while 9 Nissans were reported 
missing and 9 Honda motorcycles 
disappeared . 

Lieutenant Steve William of 
San Diego State University Police 
pointed to the value of car parts 
as one of the main initiatives for 
theft. 

"We find them [cars] stripped," 
he said. 

"People tend to think their car 
is too old to protect.. . but a car is 
worth more in parts than in 
whole," Jenkins added . 

Over half of the thefts at UCSD 
occurred during daylight hours , 
according to Jenkin who ex-
plained that this makes spotting 
theft difficult since it is harder to 
ascertain whether a car is being 
stolen or not in the day when 
thousands of cars come and go. 

Despite the recent increase in 

auto theft on campus, UCSD is 
not especially susce ptible to theft , 
Jenkins said . 

San Diego as a whole exper-
ienced an increase in auto theft 
last year with 24,470 cars missing 
in 1988. That figure represents a 
dramatic increase in theft since 
1987 when 18,583 cars were 
reported stolen, according to 
Lieutenant Grimm of the San 
Diego Police Department. 

The rate of increase, however, 
was lower than in previous years, 
said Grimm, who explained that a 
'proactive strike unit' initiated in 
October of 1988 helped lower the 
rate of theft increase in the city. 

San Diego is second only to 
Los Angeles in the number of car 
thefts in California and is number 
one per capita, according to 
Detective Robert Jones of the 
campus police. 

San Diego State University lost 
162 cars in 1988, a rise from the 
117 thefts in 1987, according to 
Lieutenant Steve Williams of

Although UCS D is not alone 

in its increased rate of car theft, 
the heightened crime on campus 
has spurred new talk on how to 
deal with the problem. 

Jenkins sees educat ion as the 
best offense his office can provide 
in assaulting the car theft prob-
lem. He plans to distribute pos-
ters and pamphlets on how to 
protect automobiles from theft. 

[n addition, Jenkins plans to 
make increased use of Commun-
ity Service Officers in lots hardest 
hit by theft. CSOs on foot will be 
less conspicuous to thieves who 
cou ld leave at the sight of police 
cars or other marked vehicles. 

The use of undercover police 
has been an expensive and not 
very successful solution to the 
problem of theft, Jenkins said . 

The police rely on students and 
faculty to report any suspicious 
activity.

Hunter S. Thompson 

So Long, George 
Editor's note: Hunter . Thomp on wrote this column in March of 

1987, when George Bu h's campaign effort suffered as a re ult of the 
Iran Contra scandal. In light of recent event and the upcoming inaugura-
tion. Hunter S . Thomp on's 1987 ob ervation are particularly 
intriguing. 

I had a dream the other night: I got a hit all a left-handed pitcher. It 
was a clean hit, and I kept runnin' and runnin' and I kept on runnin', 
but I never could get to first base. 

Negro League veteran, on televi ion 2 11 / 87 
Before this thing is over George will know agonies/ar worse than 

simple gout, or leech/ever. or even the heartbreak o/psoriasis. 
Hunter S. Thompson, S. F. Examiner, 3/ 2/ 87 

Big George bit the bullet unday night, and it was a powerful thing 
to see. There was a fa t and terrible speed to it that was almost biblical 
- like the book of Revelation, where the rivers fill with blood and the 
seeds of the land turn to poison and men will gnaw their tongues for 
pain. 

At midnight on Friday, George was the main man in Republican 
politics and the certified front-runner for the GOP presidential nomi-
nation in 1988 ... and sometime around noon on Saturday, only 12 or 
13 hour later, he was down in the ditch with all the other low-rent 
crooks and fixers and hustlers like Wild Bill Casey and Spiro Agnew 
and crazy Bob MacFarlane. who made such a silly attempt at suicide 
that even teen-agers laughed at him. 

The hammer came down very suddenly, when George was just 
tarting to feel uppity. After 16 weeks of laying back in the weeds like a 

dirty little animal, he suddenly came out swingin' .... They showed the 
whoie thing on national TV, from the time he emerged from his 
slick-silver White House jet airplane on the runway at ashua, N.H., 
until 13 hours later when a cruel combination of his son manque from 
Miami and some dingbat doctor from Guatemala named Castejon set 
him up for a felony bu t and three or four long years in a cage like the 
ones they used to put bears and big snakes in, at some federal prison 
like Eglin or Lompoc or the new windowless dungeon in Phoenix. 

It was an ugly scene. George had just received word that big-time 
political pollsters in Georgia and 11 other Southern states had made 
him a huge and prohibitive favorite to sweep the whole thing on uper 
Tue day in the first week of March '88 by winning so many state 
primary elections all at once that nobody could ever catch him. Maybe 
Dole would take Kansas and Al Haig had a lock on New Orleans, but 
Big George would be the guaranteed winner. 

That was on Saturday. George went wild with joy and ordered up a 
six-pack of California Coolers for his staff .. , and then he called his 
son, Jeb, in Miami, who told him about the letter. 

"What letter?" said George. "I never sent you any letter." 
"Oh no. " said Jeb. " lot me. It 's the one about Oliver North - that 

deal you fixed up with him with Dr. Castejon." 
George went stiff, then dropped to his knees like a wino, and wept 

openly in front of his staff people. 
Thejig was up . And even as they screamed and bitched at each other, 

theM/ami Herald was already on the street, with the Bush Castejon 
correspondence on the front page. 

It was a felony crime, and George had signed his own name to the 
letter that would introduce Ollie to the evil Dr. Castejon. The shrewd 
and treacherous vice president was no longer clean, and if he hung 
around in New Hampshire much longer they would probably lock him 
up. He was doomed. 

George went out on a limb, as they say - full of all the slick hubris 
and dark yuppie instincts that got him up there where he is today -
and somebody with a really fine feel for politics decided to chop him 
down. 

It was the same day that John Gotti, the accused Mafia chieftain, 
was acquitted in New York by a jury of his peers and went free on the 
st reets like any other plumbing contractor with six bodyguards and a 
steel-gray Cadillac limousine waiting outside the federal courtroom 
and a closet full of tailor-made suits and two beach-white overcoats 
made from the skin of unborn wolves. 

George Bush does not dress in that style. He is , after all , the vice 
president, and until the Miami Heraldgot a very sudden handle on him 
and whipped it out in the form of a doomsday-style copyright story in 
Sunday's early edition and every syndicate wire in the nation, George 
was looking almost like he might be the next president of the United 
States. 

rhat was before he spoke with the raven, who told him "nevermore." 
The bird arrived sometime around midnight , according 10 White 

Hou e sources, and George was not ready for it. He went all to pieces 
when the beast flew into his window and croaked at him repeatedly, 
.. evermore." 

It made no sense at the time although it wa in fact March 13, a 
Friday; and also the night of the full moon . .. but George i not a Moon 
Chtld . He was born undersomeother tar . June 12, 1924,i n fact. And 
he IS marked with the sign of the chicken. 

George prospered. nonetheless. He went to Yale and made friends in 
national politics so many. in fact, that he was soon offered jobs like 

.S. ambassador to Beijing, national chairman of the RepUblican 
Party and director of the Central Intelligence Agenc~ by Richard 

ixon. 
1 hat was in the good old days, when real men were still running the 

White House and the president roamed the hallways at night with a 
beaker of gin in his fist, raving and jabbering at huge oil portraits of

- The U CS 0 General Catalog, 1986-1987 

I think that I might have had a glimpse of the 
fine quality of the teaching faculty here . 
Unfortunately, it has just been a glimpse. With 
enrollment reaching an all-time high of 14, lOS 
last quarter I wonder how large has UCSD's pool 
of faculty grown in proportion? 

I was excited about immersing myself in upper 
division political science and history claues this 
year. My first upper division clau oflut quarter 
had almost 200 students enrolled and mOlt of 
them attended the class reJUlariy. I tbouJht that 
the size of the class was the exceptio. rather tMn 
the rule until I went to my next c .... It ..... weO 
over 300 students enrolled in it willa u.no.t 100 
more waiting to add theclua.1 WMcIiIcounpd, 
to say the least. Where were the ....... elutes that 
I had dreamed oft 

At the time, • IlSIUmed UCSD'I student-
faculty ratio would aUow me to intend with the 
faculty on a more personal level. Instead •• found 
myself so distanced I thousht about cbanaina my 
major to something so obaCure ibat I would be 
one of only 20 students who had chosen that 
major. But, since J have difficulty learning new 

languqes, I concluded that Chinese Studies 
would probably not be appropriate for me. 

What discouJ'aICS me even more than the lack 
of intimacy in upper diviJion courses is the inac-
cessibility of these professors outside of class. 
With classes being 10 large. they strongly dis-
couraged dropping in for a chat. No longer is 
there enough time to get to know your professor 

I as a person. Things have gotten so out of hand 
that one professor • know requires that his stu-
dents sign up for office hours. If you don't sign 
up, you don't see him. 

I can understand bow some professors mUit 
feel overwhelmed by the number of tudents tbey 
must cater to. I act overwhelmed by tryinl to 
answer all of the GUIII'dUm production workers' 
questions. 

Sometimes I seriously wonder whether or not 
professors come here strictly to do research or 
write books and then get stuck with cIaues to 
teach. There are a lot of faculty members listed in 
the course catalog, but how many of them actu-
ally teach classes? 

According to a University of California report 
85 percent of all University employees have jobs 
in wbicb they do not teach. 

Right now, that means only 15 percent of UC 
employees are hired .. teachers. How many of 
these teach a clus per quarter? I'm beainnin. to 
wonder just bow much raoarch and bow many 
books are beina produced because profeuors 
&reD' doiq what tbey were hired to do. Yet the 
UDiwnitf'leta up requirements for tenure and 
poIitions Ulat include writinl and ;e.an:b wbicb

UCSB to Get New Science Facility 
By BEN SULLIVAN 
Staff Writer, Daily Nexus 

SANTA BA RBA RA-UCS B 
will soon be home to a new major 
research center, it was a nnounced 
last month, as the National Sci-
ence Foundation listed t he cam-
pus among II sites where it will 
establish new Science and Tech-
nology Centers. 

A UCSB proposal to establish 
a Ce nter for Quantized Electronic 
Structures was chosen by the fed-
eral agency from among 323 oth-
ers nationwid e to study microe-
lectronic . First-year NSF funding 

for the ce nte r be $2. 1 million. 
"We want to make and study 

these structures because we expect 
them to ex hibit new a nd exci ting 
propert ies, .. tha t may very well 
prove to be the basis fo r revolu-
tionary new electronic devices," 
according to UCSB electrical and 
computer e ngineering Professor 
James Merz, who will serve as 
director of the center. 

In addition to predicting a 
potential change in the electronics 
industry similar to that which 
occurred when transistors re-
placed vacuum tubes, Merz also 
predicted that research at the cen-
ter will provide further under-

stand ing of the nature of matter 
a t t he at omic level. 

" 0 far, we've only scratched 
the tip of t he iceberg, utilizing the 
simplest of these q ua ntum struc-
tures," Merz said. Among the 
devices that have been developed 
using quantum electronics are a 
"quantum-well" laser - the most 
effi cient micro laser yet - a nd a 
new type of transistor. 

However, " I'm certain the best 
ideas are ones that no one has 
dreamed up yet," Merz said . 

The creation of the 11 NSF 
centers is part of an effort by the 
government to tackle a variety of

A.S. Considers Closing 
Assorted Vinyl Enterprise 

The A. -. Counci l las t night 
debated a measure that would 
discontinue the ~tuden t -run 
Assorted inyl before defeating 
Pre idem Maynard Dimmcsdalc's 
proposal for a constitutional con-
vention , which he had hoped 
would increase student represen-
tat ion in the A. '. Council. 

After hearing argu ments tha t 
As orted Vinyl continue to lose 
money each quarter and does not 
fill an established student need , 
the council po~tponed voting on 
the mea ure for one week to give 
its managers a cha nce to counter 
the claims. 

Dimmesda le cited "astronomi-
cal discrepancies" in the enter-
prise's net income, saying that it 
had continued to lose money over 
the past several years. 

According to Dimme dale , the 
record store had a deficit of $4,300 
last year, followed by a net 10 s of 
$4,112 after only the first quarter 

of this year. 
Since the enterprise is co nsist-

ently 10 ing the students' money, 
Dimmesda le aid, it is not in the 
tudent 'best inte rests to move it 

into the ncw Price Center. 
Robert Lloyd, an as istant 

manager at A ssorted Vinyl, 
claimed that the business has a lot 
of regular customers, and erves 
an im portan t st udent need . 

Traditionally, he explained , the 
fall quarter i slow for business, 
but the enterprise u ually com-
pensate for the losses with better 
sales in the winter and spring 
quarters. 

He also predicted that profits 
will increase once the store is in 
the Price Center, saying the cur-
rent location is a "cubbyhole." 

"We will expand not only our 
rock but our service," Lloyd sa id , 

predicting that more students will 
patronize the store at its newer, 
more convenient location. 

Lloyd also claimed that the 
enterprise hadn't been given uffi-
cient lime to organi7e arguments 
in its behalf. 

"We were notified Christmas 
break that we'd be closed down," 
he said, adding that they weren't 
notified of last night's meeting 
until Monday. 

After postponing the Assorted 
Vinyl measure, the council de-
bated Dimmesdale's proposal for 
a con titutional convention. 

Dimmesdale had said that the 
convention would give all inter-
ested students and groups a voice 
in the s haping of a new A.S. 
Constitution. 

Although the re olution was 
defeated , the conventi on still 
might take place. 

Earlier in the meeting Dimmes-
dale had pledged to directly peti-
tion the students if the council 
defeated the measure, saying, " It 
really would not be all that diffi-
cult to obtain [signatures of] the 
required 15 percent [of the stu-
dent body]."

complex research problems and 
to shorten the time span between 
scientific discovery and actual 
application, according to NSF 
representatives. 

"The fa t tran fer ofknowledge 
is crit ical to the nation's ability to 
compete in the world market," 
explained NSF Director Erich 
Bloch. 

UCSB officials hope the new 
center will serve as a base of oper-
ations that will enable scient ist 
from universities, national labor-
atories and private industry to 
study quantum structures in a 
multidisciplinary approach that 
has been absent in the past. 

Previously, work in this area 
has been done most ly by applied 
physicists, electrical engineers and 
materials scientists. The center 
will bring to the quest theoretical 
physicists and surface chemists 
who study ordinary matter, ac-
co rding to Mer7. 

University Bookstore 

Merz believes that the center 
will be in operation by February 
and hopes that negotiations with 
U SB will secure a pecific loca-
tion on campus for the center. 

UC Berkeley and the Califor-
nia Institute of Technology were 
also chosen by the NSF as site 
for new Science and Technology 
Centers .

Continued from pale 3 
cilmember Wes Pratt said of 
O'Connor at the reception follow-
ing her address. 

"I think our young people are 
some thing we should be 
concerned about," Pratt added 
"We need these innovative 
programs." 

He was less certain of how the 
council would receive O'Connor's 
requests, however. 

"Much of the funding has to 
come from the private sector,"

UCSD Remembers Martin Luther King 
By ANDREA ADLEMAN 
Staff Writer 

"Not since John F. Kennedy 
was assassinated has the capital 
been so shaken by a murder." The 
murder to which this 1968 New 
York Times report refers is that of 
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Washington, the country, and 
the world were stunned by the 
news of the famed civil rights 
leader's assassination in Memphis, 
Tennessee. 

Twenty-one years have passed 
ince that day in April, yet memo-

ries of King's struggle for racial 
equality remain strong in many 
individuals. 

Jennifer Stern back, Third Col-
lege resident dean, recalls where 
she was when she learned of King's 
death. "I was home sick. and I'd 
wake up in the morning, and turn 
on the radio," said Stern back, 
who was in her early teens at the 
time. "I heard on the radio that 
he'd been shot. I remember run-
ning into my parents' bedroom 
and telling them that, and [my 
mother] didn't believe me at first." 

Third College Assistant Dean 
Barbara Avery also had trouble 
believing the news. " I was in the 
Bahamas .. . and when I heard it 
on the radio, I didn't believe it at 
first. Then I thought ... that 
something tremendous was hap-
pening in the U.S."

The 13th annual Martin 
Luther King Commemora-
tive Concert will take place 
Monday, Jan. 16 in the 
Mandeville Auditorium at ,

The UCSD Gospel Choir 
and members of the UCSD

See CIVIL, pa't 13 

Many regard King's entire life 
as "something tremendous." He 
was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in 
Atlanta, Georgia . A graduate of 
Moorehouse College at the age of 
19, King went on to receive a 
Bachelor of Divinity degree and a 
Ph .D in systematic theology. 

Upon completing his studies, 
King lived with his wife and four 
children in Montgomery, Ala-
bama. His action against Mont-

was deadj at first. Then 
1 thought . . . something

-Barbara A very 
Assistant Dean 

Third College 

gomery's segregated public trans-
portation system brought him 
national recognit ion as a nonvio-
lent civil rights activist. In 1957, 
King formed what was later to be 
called the Southern Christian 
leadership Conference. SCLC's 
Atlanta offices served as the cen-
ter of King's efforts when he 
moved to Atlanta in 1960 to 
become the co-pastor of a church 
there. 

King was a key leader in the 
well-known 1963 march on 
Washington, where he delivered 
his famous "I Have a Dream" 
speech. The following year, his 
efforts were awarded as he became 
the youngest recipient of the obel 
Peace Prize. 

In 1967, King began to advo-
cate peace in Vietnam, an action 
which causl!d much public con-
troversy. Although he received 
mixed reactions in the press, he 
was generally criticized for his 
position by fellow black leaders. 

A year later, King was shot to 
death during a trip to Memphis, 
where he intended to lead a pro-
test by striking sanitation workers, 
most of whom were black. While 
King and his aides, one of whom 
was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, stood 
conferring on a hotel balcony, 
King was fatally shot. 

As the April 5, 1968 hcadlines 
suggested , the assassin was a white 
man . James Earl Ra y, who 
pleaded guilty in March 1969 and 
received a 99-year jail sentence. 

Soon after King's death, racial 
tensions and violence escalated . 
Questions abounded in the press. 
In two separate articles, News-
week 's April 15, 1968 issue 
addressed the increase in violence: 
"Were the pictures ofthe machine 
gun on the Capitol steps and Chi-
cago in flames only premonitions 
of a America without Martin 
Luther King?" It further stated 
that, "The outbreak of violence 
that flowed in [the] aftermath [of 
King's assassination] was a repu-
diation of everything that King's

repeats itself. I think it's impor-
tant that we remind students." 

Whisenhunt , who is involved 
with the African-American Stu-
dent Union and the Student 
Affirmative Action S:ommittec, 
employs several of King's tactics 
in her own approach. 

Whisenhunt endeavors to bring 
about change by working with the 
established system, although she 
adds that, "Martin Luther King

life - and death - had stood 
for." 

T oday's generation is faced with 
the challenge of continuing to 
work towards King's goal of racial 
and social justice. In her efforts 
agianst race discrimination, Muir 
junior Denise Whisenhunt feels 
that making the present genera-
tion aware of the past is crucial. 

"Some of our generation think. 
'The '60s? That's over. We don't 
have to worry about it,'" explains 
Whisenhunt. " But what happens 
is , people forge t and histo ry 

Third College senior Paul 
Lanning feels that society as a 
whole has benefitted from King's 
voicing t he issue of racial discrim-
ination. "A lot of people, 1 think, 
owe a lot to him," said Lanning. 
" It doesn't matter what their race 
is; it's the fact that we're all a lot 
more aware- of where we should 
be headed as a society." 

Tyrone Harvey, also of Third 
College, believes that people must 
become open-minded and for-
ward-thinking in order that eth-
nic relations improve. Concern-
ing Martin Luther King Jr. Day, 
designated in 1983 by Congress as 
the third Monday in January, 
Harvey feels that "a lot of people 
think of it asa black holiday, but 1 
don't see it that way. 

"I think of It as an American 
holiday. It's a day that Americans 
need to stop and identify where 
we've come from, and set goals 
for where we should go."

Four Tritons Score in Double Figures 

Women's Basketball Pounds 
Whittier College, 81-49 

By JONCARLO MARK 
taff Writer 

The women's basketball team 
demonstrated a balanced scoring 
attack Tuesday night - four 
players finished in double figures 
but nobody scored more than 14 
points - to lead the women's bas-
ketball team to an 81-49 destruc-
tion of Whittier College. UC D 
improves to 8-4 on the season. 

The Tritons jumped out to an 
early 12-2 lead , shutting down the 
Whittier scoring with solid 
defense. "Going into the game. we 
knew Whittier had only a few 
offensive threats ... in particular 
Patricia Palmer." Triton Head 

Coach Judy Malone explained. 
"Our goal was to s hut her down 
and get her to foul out." 

The Tritons re ponded well to 
this chore. as Palmer had three 
foul b) halftime and fini hed 
with only I I poin t . 

At the half, the Tritons led 37-
25, and it was apparent that they 
were gomg to dominate. Besides, 
they were already out rebounding 
Whittier 23-16 and had forced 11 
turnover . 

UCSD more tha n doubled the 
rebounding margin by the end of 
the game. winding up with a 56-36 
edge on the boards. Triton for-
ward Bernadette Diepenbrock 
pulled down II of those rebound.

PHIL'S ANALYS1S ... O kay, so maybe I'm get-
ting a little desperate about deciding what to pick each 
week, but the Super Bowl is a week and a half away 
and I really didn't feel like picking t he fencing tour-
nament in Stanfo rd this weekend. So you're stuck 
with the Price Center. Or are you? The fact is, you'll 
probably never even get to see the darn thing in opera-
tion until sometime in the 23rd century. In the first 
issue of the Guardian... this school yea r (Sept. 19), it was 
announced that the Price Center was right on time 
and would be finished sometime between February 
and March. Yeah, right. Have you looked at the 
sucker lately? Granted, it's come a long way, but it's 
got a long way to go. I'm gonna be nice and give it all 
of April to be completed, but don't bet on it. Rather, 
Phil advises that you put your money down and take . . .

UCSD poured it on in the 
second half as Michelle Leohner 
supplied the offensive punch. The 
junior forward scored eight of the 
Tritons' ten point in a three min-
ute span a he fini hed the game 
with 14 points. Jill Koster and 
Tracy Ragatz finished with 12 
points apiece for UCSD, while 
Beth Koenig added 10. Asa team, 
the Tritons shot an impressive 
49% fro m the floor. 

When asked what kind of 
improvements have occured with-
in the team since the beginning of 
the season, Malone responded, 
"We are playing much better 
defense .. . which is a key to our 
success. Going into the season, 
our goal was to playas hard as we 
could, and our good effort i pay-
ing off."

Amazing Shot Saves Tritons 

Troy Nails 58-Foot Bomb 
to Clip La Verne at Buzzer 

By BR IAN ITOW 
Staff Writer 

Scoop Troy hit a 58-foot 
buzzer-beater to ave the Triton 
men's basketball team from yet 
another set back in its season of 
disa ppointment as it snuck by the 
University of La Verne 68-66 last 
night at the Triton Pavilion. 

The shot turned out to be a 
golden egg in an otherwise ugly 
game that see-sawed back a nd 
forth throughout. La Verne was 
able \ 0 capi talize on UCSD mis-
take to build a 39-35 lead a t the 
half, but forward Gordon McNeil 
scored 16 points to lead a Triton 
comeback that foun d the team 
one point down with 40 seconds 
remaining. 

After a timeout, the Tritons ran 
the clock down to 16 seconds 
before Kirk Kramer found Troy 
who hit a fifteen foot baseline 
jump shot that gave them a 65-64 
lead. 

But La Verne would not die 
just yet . Forward Lamont land -
ers matched the Triton challenge 
when, with three seconds remain-
ing. he hit a fa ll-away 15-foot 
ba eli ne jump shot of his own. 
This gave La Verne a 66-65 lead,

Robin Guthrie 

The Cocteau Twins never fail to 
soothe the wounds after a hord day in 
this world. When feeling forlorn or 
exhausted, there's nothing I like betrer 
than to retreat into my cozy cave, put 
on some Cocteou Twins, and crawl 
into bed. 

The lullaby-like vocals create a 
sensation of being back in the womb, 
hearing my mother's voice rever· 
berating outside, unintelligible but 50 
comforting. The Cocteau Twins new 
album, Blue Bell Knoll on Capitol 
Records 4AD label, continues this 
trodition for me. 

Vocalist Elizabeth Fraser says about 
music, "It has to be about emotion. It 
hos to be. It con't be about onything 
else." Blue Dell Knoll is emotion. 

Ir is incited by it and it incites it. The 
lush, worm, utterly sensual 50unds are 
to be e~ 'lected from a Cocteou Twins 
olbum. 

Cocteau Twins started out when 
Robin Guthrie and Will Heggie sow 
Elizabeth Fraser dancing or a club in 
their hometown of Grangemouth, 
Scotland. 

They figured if she could dance so 
well, she must be able to sing. Shortly 
after their fi rst LP, Garlands, CoCeou 
Twins went through a troumatic time 

Elizabeth Fraser 

w ith producers during which Will 
Heggie left the bond. 

Fraser and Guthrie then made the 
exotic Head Over Heals by them-
selves. 

In 1984, Simon 8.oymonde, formerly 
of Drowning Craze, was asked to join 
the band, and the trio scored their first 
big hit, "Pearly Dewdrops Drops." 

Success brought the Cocteau Twins 
into contact with the tacl~ ier, more 
trivial side of pop for the first time. 
They soon establ ished a reputation as 
unwilling porticipants. 

"Weoring nice clothes isn 't going to 
change the 50rt of person you are or 
the sort of music you mal~e," Froser 
told one disoppointed teen mog-
azine. 

Treasure, their third LP, immediotely 
topped the English IndependentChorts. 

It was lighter than its predecessors. 
somehow more ethereal. and was 
met with thunderous adulation. 

Guthrie refused to see what all the 
fuss wos obout. "I would have thought 
that the music explains everything," 
he said. When probed further he said, 
"I think about cool~ ing the teo and 
about Elizabeth Hoovering the car-
pet. " 

The Pink Opaque os well os Vidoria' 

Simon Raymonde 

land were released in 1986 to wide 
criticol acclaim. 

The Moon and the Melodies, a 
colloboration with minimalist jazz pianist 
Harold Budd, was 0150 released that 
year. It was described as "dense, like 
iron fog or smoke trapped in 0 bottle." 

The music of the Cocteau Twins is 
abstroct and private. It speoks in a 
language which does not te ll its 
audience whot to think, but how to 
feel. 

Each song on Dlue Dell Knoll sounds 
as if it tokes place in a different 
climate. The melodious voca ls and 
heartbeat rhythms combine to form 
rich, langourous music. 

Although the words ore nearly olways 
unintellig ible, one gets the feeling 
that they ore ethereal and profound. 

Fraser said, "I'm more interested in 
the way the words sound, and what 
you con do if you soy words in different 
ways, thon in what the words them-
selves actually mean. I just don't want 
to write about myself .,. I m not 
interested in me." 

Perhaps Fraser's primol scream, a 
vocal non-technique from the throor 
insteod of the STomach. IS one aspect 
that has attracted such special otten· 
tion to the band . 

See TWINS. page 5 



The man at the piano sits calmly, 
his fingers gently stroking the keys. 
His eyes look at the keys and then 
out into the room , not at the 
music notes sitting on the piano. 

He opens his mouth and sings 
out a melody that is funny, 
nostalgic and entertaining. Dave 
Frishberg, songwriter, lyricist and 
pianist played a solo concert on 
Wednesday, Jan. 11 at 8 p.m. at 
the Mandeville Auditorium. 

Frishberg's style is one that has 
captured acclaim and put him into 
a category of his own. His lyrics 
are one of the greatest parts of his 
music. Such lYriCS are: " My at~ 
torney Bernie. He's got Dodger 
season boxes and an office full of 
foxes ." Another very funny song 
is his masterpiece titled" Another 
Song About Paris, " in wh ich 
Maurice Chevalier has his cafe au 
lai t on the Rue de la Paix near the 
Champs Elysees. 

Frishberg's career began when 

he wa young, after his clas ical 
piano teacher and he failed to see 

" One day I put a Mozart piece 
into a Conga rhythm - da da da~ 
dum da da da~dum . I played it in 
my lesson and was bawled out. I 
couldn't belive that such a thing 
was wrong." 

Frishberg developed his own 
style and has done quite well . He 
continued experimenting with his 
own music and after two years in 
the military, he graduated from 
college. He then headed east to 
the mecca of jazz music; New York 
City. 

Here he was able to establish 
himself a name along with other 
great jazz musicians: Al Cohn, 
Zoot Sims, Ben W eb ter and 
Bobby Hacket. 

Today Frishberg has eight al~ 
bums to his credit, four of them 
with Grammy nominatIons for 
Best Jazz Voca\.

fBoost' is a Bust 
by la u ra kna p p 

hiatus writer 

The BooSI, starringJames WooJs 
and ean Young, does nOt allow 
you to It!ave tht! theater with a 
boost. This film ha no happy 
endi ng, and does nOt leave you 
smiling. It is a film about drugs, 
mainly cocaine, and how d rugs 
can destroy two people who seem 
to have everything. 

Unfortunately, tht! acting and 
the tory prohibits The Boose from 
being a good film . 

Woods plays Lenny Brown, a 
salesman m New York trying to 
find a way to makl' a forrune. His 
beautiful wife Linda, played by 
Young (No Way Out ),IS a paralegal. 

T ht!y live in a small apa rtment 
in New York . ne day Lenny IS 
discovert!d by a real-estate tycoon 
and enticed to go to Los Angeles 
and join his firm . 

teven Hill, playing the tycoon 
Max, is very convincing as a 

Boost, a film about destructive drug abuse, is a flop . 

w~althy man who is Lenny'S 
mentor. 

Hl' whisk Lenny and Linda off 
to LA ,lnJ glws dll'm cars, money 
and a houS<' in Beverly Hills. 

bVlously, th,' couple's lift' i 
turned up id~ down . But Lt'nny is 
an insrant success and they have 
everything they l'wr drt'amed of. 

Th<!n one day investment laws 
change and Lenny's busmess is no 
longt'r profitable. He is in debt, 
and at a party for a "boo t" h~ 
eric coca Int'. Then hl' has Linda 
try ir and both be orne instant 
junkies. 

From here the story is pre-
dictable: they steal and lose t heir 
home; Lenny has an overdose and 
imnwdiatciy does more cocai ne. 

They go to Santa Cru z to 
straighten out after Linda gets 
pregnant. Bur when some friends 
from LA come to visit, Li nda does 
coke and loses the baby. 

Then they go ba k to LA and 
get hooh·d on quallud~s. It gets 
worse and worse and drags on a nd 
on. 

The acting i not good enough 
to hold your attention, but it is 
best when they are on drugs. 

The problem is that in the 
opening scenes when Lenny wasn't 
on drugs, he acted like he was. As 
a result, the brilliant salesman role 
wasn't con\'incing. 

Young's performance was better 
and more convincing, bur srill did 
not save this movie. 

Tht' story was unconvinclllg and 
often boring. When it wasn't 
boring, it was violent and made 
me crillge. 

The /3oosl is not a film that you 
should go see for a lighthearted 
night on the town. 

James W oods and 'ca n YounX in B()()st 
I left the theater deprt!s ed and ing thei r lives for an ho ur and a 

with no hope about the prospect half (it seemed much lo nger). 
of stopping the incredible problem 
created when people ust! drugs. 

These people had tragedy after 
tragedy happen to them, yet they 
continued to use the drugs and 
ru in their lives. It seemed almost 
impossible to believe. 

The Boose is not a movie I would 
rt!commend . I did not enjoy 
watching people using drugs ruin-

Everything about the film, such 
as the acting, the story and the 
direction, could have been im-
proved. 

U nless yo u ' rea big fan of James 
W oods or Sean Young, or if you 
want to be depressed by a poorly 
produced film, The Boost is no t 
worth $5.50.

For the benefit of rhost· n:aJt!rs 
who have been ha nging out in 
Albania fo r the last th ree months, 
Hiarus offers the fo llowing news: 
the new R.E. M. album, Green, is 
now prominently displayed at 
record shops from here to Athens, 
Georgia. 

It has a nifty o range cover 
which, as usual, has the band's 
name and the album's title pro-

minently displayed among the 
am biguous-a rtsy-post -m od ern-
R.E.M. black and white artwork. 
(R.E.M. incidentally, is always 
spelled R.E.M., and nev<!r REM. 
Thus the official press release 
informs us.) 

Inside the o range (fteen package 
is a piece of vinyl, magnetic tape 
cassette, or compact digital disc 
which when played on appropriate 
eq uipment enables listeners to 
hear reproductions of eleven new 

R.E. M. songs. More about that

The Cocteau Twins Perfect 
Their Soothing Sounds 

Continued from pag 1 
One track from Blue Bell Knoll, 

"Carolyn's Finger ," was recently 
voted number 49 in San Diego 
radiO station 91 X listener's poll 
- quite impressive conSidering 
that the album had just come out, 
and 91 does not generally play 
bands like the Cocteau Twins. 

Blue Bert KnoH seem partic-
ularly moody for a Cocteau TWins 
album. In prevIous albums, the 
songs have all sounded similar in 
tone and rhyth mic quality. This 
album seems more selective and 
polished In its tendency to flit 
from gorhlc to introspective to 
am!lzingly perky. 

This variety is reflected in odd 
, ong tides such a "Suckling the 
Mender," "Spooning Goodsing-
ing Gum," and "A Ki sed Out 
Red Floatboat." 

Blue Bell Knoll is over-flowing 
with effervescence and heavenly 
imagery. It is filled with intro-
spection which is too abstract to 
fully reveal itself. 

The Cocteau Twins is perhaps 
one of the only contemporary 
bands whose members are selling 
their imaginations and not them-

R.E.M. The New Trend? 
Continued from page 4 
size wall poster of Michael himself. 

2. Recent press photos fo r the 
album show Michael Stipe posing 
shirtless. [n these photographs he 
can clearly be st:en to bl' flexi ng his 
abdo minal muscles. Moreover, his 
hai r is in fashio nable wet disarray 
and his facia l t:xpression is clea rl y 
tht: ort of sneer popular on -
wdl, on Gendeml'n's Quarterly 
clothing modds, Thl' rcader is Idt 
to draw his or her own con-
clusions. 

M ichae l St ipe was recently seen 
in a week-long series of inte rviews 
on MTV wt:a ring a big Russian 
style fur hat. If such hats as these 
become popular all of a sudden, 
you know who to blame. 

G reen opens with a jangly, 
bouncy Byrds-li ke tu ne ca lled 
"Pop Song 89." It is very straight-
fo rward both in lyrical content 
and musical techniq ue. Why, you 
ask , is the song called " Pop Song 
89?" [s this band crying to make a 
Big Statement About Music? Are 
they trying to be Obscure and 
Am biguous? 

Stop thinking like that. Wh ile 
you , the readers, were not looking 
(or maybe while you were look-
ing), R.E.M. has fi nally walked 
over the threshold of Rock 'n Roll 
Stardom. Read on: 

Pewr Buck, guitarist: " W e want 
to gi ve as many people as we can 
the opportunity to hear us. W e've 
never known what makes a record 
a hit, although I've always thought 
we've had a good blend of ele-
ments: sort of bubblegum heavy 
metal. " 

M ike W ills, bassist: "Can we be 
commercial? I don't see why not." 

Move over , Bon Jo vi. Already 
everyone who would be con-
sidered hip is declaring Green to be 
the worst R.E.M, album yet. Rock 
critics and art students have yet 
another target: " Well , yeah, I used 
to like R.E.M . before rhey put out 
the new album. " 

Green is, of course, one of the 
best, if no t the best album of 
1988 . To begin with, there are 
fo ur straight-ahead party songs: 
" Po p Song 89," "Stand," "Get 
Up," and " Orange Crush ." All 
four of them are three-chord turn-
u p-the-radio-a nd-h um -them-all -
day music. Go wear your black 
clo thes somewhere else. 

There are also three slower, 
mo re reflective songs on Green. 
" W orld Leader Pretend" com-
b int:s concepts of glo bal dip-
lo macy and personal reflection in 
its lyrics. In both poetic content 
and musica l style the song evokes 
the greatest musical successes of 
Cat Stevens and Jo hn Lennon 
without sinking to the squalid 
depths o f preachy self-degrad-
at ion. 

"I Remt: m ber Cali fo rn ia" is a 
Walt Wh itman-like ca talog of life 
o n the W est Coast, se t to a slow, 
grinding metallic rhythm. 

The last song on the record is 
not referred to by name. It is a 
lyrical, rolling ballad which may 
or may not be a cover of someone 
else's song. It ' a classic R.E.M . 
tunl' anyway, although not up 
there with the other two great 
songs on the record . 

Th<' only really, truly horrible 
song on the record is omething 
ca lk·d "Tht: Wrong hild." This 
I really, absolutely, positively the 
very worst song R.E.M. has ever 

wrltt~n . Watch Ollt for it. (If a 
ontcst for the W or ·t Song of 

1988 is held, "The Wrong hild" 
is in the ru nning with "Van 
Dkml'n' Land" (rom the new U2 
album, Rutt/" and Hum. Both 
should be ta ken to the river and 
drowned.) 

Seven truly good songs out of a 
total of eleven, and o nly one mi -
fire. Alth o ugh Grecn will be 
avoided like the plague by the 

trend-fo llowers of the world, true 
musi fa ns will no doubt fi nd a lot 
about it to like. Mah your choice. 
You have been warned.
