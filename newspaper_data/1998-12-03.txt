University Must Uphold Its 
Contract With Students 

Rain cannot stop the TA strike. Despite the show-
er on Tuesday, the TAs promoting unionization 
waded back and forth at the enLrance~ 10 campus, 
waving picket signs at cars that honked in support. 
Their spirits were not dampened; and their pr test 
was sti \I stron g. 

Although the rain did not seem to squelch the fires 
of the protesting TAs, the strike itself is ~til l severely 
damaging undergraduate educati on at UC D. While 
thi s week may be inconvenient and bothersome to the 
administration, for professors and students who 
depend on TAs r r help in class, this week is a disa~ ­
ter. Furthermore, becau ... t.: of the strikt: we fear fh e 
university will not fulfill its educational contract with 
its students. 

As students, we pay our fuiti on to tht.: C Rt.:gt.:llls 
who, in turn , agree to provide us wi th a quality edu-
ca ti on. This means that each quarter, studen t ~ 
receive a sy llabus from a professor and agree to 
abide by its rul es. SlLIdenls agree to fulfill certain 
requirements - writing papers. taking test~, reading 
bo ks - receiving, in return , course credit and a 
grade from the uni vers ity. The studen ts must always 
abide by the universi ty's rules, but the uni versity is 
breaking its contract with the students, changi ng the 
rules it has to follow and not fu lfi lling its own 
requirements. 

cctions for many classes arc being can eled 
because there is no one available to tea h them. 
Wifhout TAs [0 grade hundreds of hand-written 
final s, many professors are opting for the easy way 
out and changing the ronnat of their fina l exams to 
multiple-choice tests on cantrons, which are quick-
ly graded by machines . 

In some classes, the grades students receive are 
being changed from letter grades to pass/not pass. 
The worst case may occur in classes that are chang-
ing their grading status to "in progress," making stu-
dents wait weeks or even months after fa ll quarter is 
over before they can fini sh their work in a class . 

These changes are inexcusable. The strike may 
pose problems for the uni versity, but those problems 
should not be transferred onto the students. UCSD is 
still required to flilfill its obligation to the students. 
This means that instructi on should go on as planned; 
final s should not be changed and classes should nat 
be canceled. The uni versity needs to take whatever 
action necessary to guarantee that education continue

UNIONIZATION LOOKS COSTLY, 
INEFFICIENT AND PREMATURE 

COMMENTARY: 
Expense of unioni zation 
will be absorbed by 
tudents and taxpayers 

By Panfilo Marquez 
SpeCial to the Guard ian 

All things arc permissible, not all 
things are beneficial. This adlllonition 
was offered by SI. Paul to the early 

hri stian church in thc Roman Empire. 
Though the present questi on of union-
ization is quite different . the waming 
still seems utterly appropriate. 

At issue for the rcmainder of the 
quarter, and however Illany years Ihis 
drags on, is the dcceitfully simple 
question of whether the ni vcrsity of 

alifornia shoultl recognize a union of 
TAs. readers. tUlors and potentially 
others. I offer a si mple perspective: 
unionilatiOIl is a thoroughl y expensive 
and pn:mature response to a scries of 

i~sues that may still he rcso lvetl 
th rough Illl:ans that arc Illore efTi cicnt, 
cost-saving and in line wilh thc uni -
versi lY's edu«.:a tionalmission. 

First. unions are an expensive and 
time-consuming altemative for conlli ct 
resolution. Historical ly, Ihe impact of 
unions has been dear. nions cause 
incrt:ases ill wages and regulations, at 
tillles they decrease prolil margins for 
private finus, commonly create adver-
sarial relationships betwet:n employee 
and employer. and drastically increase 
litigation co,ts. Somc of the,e items 
lIlay seem benign or even bcnelicial at 
fiN, hut reasont:d r.:lkction dl.!mon-
strales that thi~ expell~e wi II nul be 

ah~orhed by unions. hUI wi ll he passed 
on eithl:r dirt:«.:tly to students through 
work stoppages and student rees or 
ihdi rt:ct ly 10 taxpayt:r,. 

When unions demand that mem-
hers pay union fees, it is doubtful thai 
union members will «.:lIt thcir own 
salaries over the long term to pay su«.:h 
lees. More than likely, the uni~ will 

It Is difficult to deny 
that costs will rise 
across the board and 
that at minimum, 
students will pay with 
a portion of their 
education and perhaps 
with their wallets. 
demand higher wages. These 
increased wages will go to all TAs, 
readers and tutors, regardless of union 
membership. Add the costs of work 
slow downs or Iht: educational impacts 
or sirikt:s, and the picture he(;omes 
even more hleak . 

In addition. unions hirt: professional 
attorneys 10 litigate and represent their 
interests. so univer~ities must do the 
same to respond. Overall, il is di nicull 
to tlcny that cosls wi II ri~e acros~ the 
board and that at a minimum, ~tudent~ 
will pay wilh ;1 portion or III 'ir educa-
tion and pt:rhaps wi th their wallets. 

This is nOI 10 say Ihal unions arc 
inherently wrong or inappropriate. 

Il ion, have a rich tradition around Ihe 
world as powerful mean~ to organizt: 
laborers to prote«.:t «':olllmon interests. 
Among Mexican Americans in 
Calif'ornia, it W,IS a strike that thrust 
some of their most prominent leaders 
into the national scene. Strikes and 
labor unions have helped workers pre-

servl.! their wages and 10 proteci safety 
and health standards in the workplace . 
Thc existen~e or unions is nOI at issue 
here, ralher the appropriateness or 
them as a response to the grievances of 
studenl s employed by the University 
of California . That unions have been 
hi storiC<llIy beneficial is fairly clear, 
that their expense is justified at UCSD 
is not. 

Whal grievances have TAs broughl 
to the table as justification for the fight 
to unioni ze, and which TAs have 
protesled labor condi tions'] In my 
exper ien«.:es as Office of Graduate 
Studies and Research intern, chair of 
the Registration Fee Committee, a TA 
in Ihe linguistics program and Vice 
Presidenl Internal or Graduate Student 
Associalion. I know of three speci fi c 
issues that seem to be most prevalent. 

The first issue, the demand for 
dependent health care for graduate stu-
dents who arc married or have «.: hil-
dren , is a relatively quiet issue that 
does not really involve ideology or 
political bias. The issue is genera lly 
resolved by individuals weighing 
offers for hea lth insurance from a 
numher of providers and making 
informed, personal dedsions. Teams 
that have investigated insurance offer~ 
to be ,o ld through the univer~ity have 
concluded that it is far better for stu-
dents wi th dependents to purchase out-
side coverage from independent 
providers like Kaiser. 

A sel.:Ond i~sue has heen the demand 
that ~Iudent unions be recogniled 
necaw,e a\ slUtlt:nls, thcy have Ihc right 
to unioni/.e. This argu ment misses the 
mark altogether. The right 10 exercise a 
freedom may be intrinsic. bu t we do 
ourselves a great injustice if we miss 
the accompanyi ng responsibility to 
exer«.: ise that right with prudence and 
grave concern for our peers. The 
social, educational and economic «.:osts 
must be reckoned with the potential

Chancellor Dynes has men-
tioned that he i~ nol aware of t:xact-
Iy what issues arc on Ihe tahlc ror 
discussion. This is somewhat disin-
genuuus und a dear indicatiun that 
Ihe university has not heen aggres-
sive enough in addressing Ihe Iinal 
and mosl crilical iss lI e or thi s 
dehate: Ihe working condilions of 
the TAs. 

I would propost: thai an honest 
confrontation of Iht: Issues sur-
rounding the wrltll1g-program 
workloads is in urder. However, the 
unionization cJ'forts have prevented 
any such action. The lerms of the 
debate arc no longer aboul working 
conditions proper. but only about 
unionization . This is unfortunale. 

The debate has now heen 
ahsorbed hy closed-minoed individ-
uals intent on t:nacting a union with-
out even consideri ng other 
approaches to problem-sol ving. I I' 
we contend that the administration 
has been slow 10 respond. line. If this 
is true, I wi ll join Ihose who want to 
take admi ni slrators to task . But 
unionization docs not take adminis-
trators 10 task . it takes the students to 
task . It imposes a formula l'or con-
llict resolulion and arhilration where 
the (;osts for Ihe system musl be 
bome by students, in exchange lur 
no real additional benefits. 

One final issue requires men-
tion. Union leaders on campu~ and 
some students have been quick to 
oller degrading interpretations of 
adminislrators' motives and actions. 

Yet no one has questiOned Ihe 
motives of the Uniled Auto Workers 
(UAW) in sleppi ng into the SdlOUI -
house to organi ze student~ . It is 
undear whether the union ha~ pure 
intentions to simply improve the 
educational mission of the universi -
ty. It is possible that thc union has 
other motives. If administralors arc 
guilty of stalling ano mislllanagi1'tg 
legitimate grievances. what i~ I he 
union guilty or in Ihis ordeal" The 
nalional pulitical agenda or the 
UAW may not be so tran~parcnt. It 
is a dl~tinct pu.,sibility that union 
kaders arc not purely intere,tt:d III 
working condilions at CSD. 

I c;lI1nol contend that I support 
the lack of ac tion on Ihe legitilllalt: 

i~sue that has been PUI on the table: 
the working conditions of TA~. 
However, I cannot support a ,harp 
ano uhtuse reaction to this conlliet 
thai wuuld overall increase the 
soc ial , educational ami economic 
«.:osts for , tudents ano taxpayer~ 
alike. 

I would olfel thai to show

of these issues: 10 confront the is~ue 
and not «.:reate addi ti onal adversari-
al relutionships on a campu~ and 
polilical scene already ,egregated; 
to at lea,t attempt a cooperalive 
approach to problem solving out-
side of the courtroom: and mo, t 
importantly, to leave last re,ort:. 
alont: for now, arc the hallmarks of

COMMENTARY: 
'Mo t Favored Nation 
statu given to human 
rights violator, China 
By Brook Garrettson 
Contnbutmg Opmlon Wnter 

"Most raHlfI:d t'\ation ·· trading 
status is n: ~erved for nations that 
arc struh:gic partners and respect 
human civil rights. In heing granted 
this statu s. China ha~ gained far 
more from the West than the West 
has gained from China. 

China has the econo my of a 
"deve loping nati on" today, due 
largely to it s past 50 years under 
totalitarian rule. "Made in China" 
is printed on practically all of our 
consumer goods - from running 
shoes to computers, automoh ile 
parts to di gi tal cordless telephones 
- hecause of lowered tariffs and 
greater trade cooperation from the 
United tates. As money !lows into 
C hinu ' ~ economy from export s 
(with still formidahle trade harriers 
to U. . consumer goods), some 
estimates from human rights orga-
nizations suggest a th ird of all of 
China's ex ports are made, at least 
in part , hy forced slave lahor 
(ApOl:alypse Code 1997). 

Human rights activist Harry Wu 
said that political prisoners arc 
bei ng forced to work on a major 
Wor ld Bank-funded agricu ltural 
project in western Chin a. The 
World Bank, funded in part wi th 
U.S. taxpaycr dollars. has provided 
loans of almost $23 hillion to 
China (Apocal ypse Code, 1997). 

It appears that China is huilding 
a world eco nomi c and military 
superpower at the expense of the 
West and Chinese ci ti ze ns. The 
known human abuses include wn-
trolling the personal lives of the 
Chinesc people by limiting the 
number of children born to each 
family (the official one-child poli -
cy), selling male/ female quotas, 
forci ng abortions wi thou t anesthe-
~i a and running poor and abusive 
orphanagcs that house mostly 
unwanted lillie girls and infant s 
with phy~il:al or mental defect~ . 

These ·,(;hildren's gulags" have 
hecn dOl:umentcd hy Human 
Rights Watl:h. the Population 
Research Institutc. Only 10 percent

ject to forced organ donations. 
Over 1-10 perl:ent of Asia 's tran~­
plan tcd organs come from Chi na in 
this manner ("CNN ews Today:· 
July 1-4. 19118). 

The lack of value Chi na plal:es 
on human life brings forth the 
question : where arc the human 
ri ghts activists when the vote b 
being taken for China's w ntinued 
"Most Favored ation " status? 

Environmentali st~ and Green Part y 
members were silent during inci-
dcnces such as the construction of 
the dam aaoss the prominent 
Yangtle Ri vcr. hina 's ali-impor-
tant life line that now fl oods and 
destroys homes and hi stori l: sight~ , 
as well as wildlife habitats. The 
Communist be lief, "the end justi-
fies the means:' unfortunately 
seems to prevail. 

Preceding Clinton's arrival in 
Chi na this June, Chinese authori-
tics r unded up and imprison d 
hundreds or pro-democracy 
activists and hri stian '·d issidents." 

Chinese missi les 
such as the 5-18 
'Satan,' the most 
destructive known 
to man, are now 
accurately aimed at 
13 of our most 
populated cities, 
courtesy of the 
Clinton-Gore team. 
Clinton gave speeches in Shanghai 
and Tiananmen Square congratulat-
ing democratic reforms. while the 
prisoners were being beaten and 
tortured a few blocks away 
(, ·Chri stian Broadcast ctwork 

ews:· June 30, 1998). 
In one speech, a careless state-

ment hy Clinton undermined 50 
years of t:arcful diplornat:y to hal -
ance the power hetween Mainland 
China and Taiwan. Contrary to 
U.S. foreign policy, Clinton 's state-
ment regarding Taiwan iRc luded, 
"the Un ited States would not make 
it a poli cy to protect her rrom 
aggression nor would the United 
States favor the recognition of 
Taiwan·' as an independent country 
(, 'Christi an Broadcast Network 
News: ' June 30. 199tl) . 

For decades, democratic and eco-
nomically thri vi ng Taiwan ha~ heen 
one of our ~tmnge~t allie~ in the 
region. From Japan to South Korea 
and India, the .S. alignment wi th 
China has caused shock and anxiety 
("A Strategic Disaster for the u.5. 
and Its Asian Allies," Was/lillRlolI 
Tlllles. July 13-19, 1998). 

hinn 's aggression toward 
Taiwan was exe mplified when 
China closed the Taiwan Strait, 
launched test missiles nearby and 
w ndul:ted intimidating war game~ . 

China'~ chief forcign affairs minis-
te r's response to the U.S . aircraft 
carrier sent to the Strait on 
Taiwan's behalf. wa~ to threaten a 
balli stic missile launch targeting 
Los Angeles. 

" I don' t really think you wou ld 
be wi lling to lose Los Angeb over 
Taiwan," the foreign affairs m i ni~ter 
said (Arxx:alypse Code, 1997). The 
emharrassing incident was quil:kly 
swept under the rug by the Clinton 
administration and the media . 

··Most Favored I ·ation" status 
has also henclited China 's growing 
mil itary might. Clinton recently 
ordered I()gi~tics tra1l1111g to 

hina's 300-million-soldier mil itia 
so that thi s force wi ll. for the Iirst 
ti me, be supplied during global 
l:omhal. 

Besides .S. technologica l aid, 
China's military arsenal includes 
divi . ions of the latest Russ ian 
li ghtcr planes and supersonic long-
range bombers. Currently, China 
produces the Ru s~ian SU-27 fighter 
bomber as part of a 20 bi llion dol -
lar joi nt-wcapons agreement with

Instead of discouraging this 
alarming prolifcra ti on, the 
Clinton ,ore tcam has pll~hed for 
and gotten thc transli:r of ,ensitive 
missile guidance technology to 
China. Chinese mi ssi les sllch as the

ci ties, courtesy of the Cli nton-Gore 
Il:am ("Chiml, Mi ssiles and Clinton," 
Wall Slreel } o llrllul, May 22, 1998). 

Americans have been led to 
believe that the United Statcs has a 
protec ti vc Shi eld against enemy 
missiles. a mi ssi le defense system 
of sons. However, Clinton contin-
ues to hlock funding 10 any su(;h 
systems (" hina. Missi Ics and

Clinton is agai nst the American

countries now beli eved to he devel-

much broader and deeper than i ni -
tially thoughl. "Protecting America

'lilllex , St:pl. 7-13, I 99tl). 

As pan of a 7.5 bi ll ion dollar

As Europe and Japan foeu, on

noted that Iran recently received

As the money !lows into ·China

PORNOGRAPHY INDUSTRY EXCLUDES WOMEN 
COMMENTARY: 
Magazine and other 
pornographic goodies 
aimed largely at men 
By Melody Gonzales 
Staff Writer 

It was my friend 's 181h hirthday 
and my roommate~ and I decidcd to 
go sh Jpping for hcr birthday pre-
~ent. We needed to gel In:r wlne-
Ihing special for thc beginning of 
adulthood and agreed thaI Ihe per-
fect gin would l:O lne from a lill ie 
shopping trip to "F Street." Arler 
all , whal could he more appropriate 
birthday gi lt ~ for an I ll-year-old 
than ~ex I Oy~ and porn l1lag~'! 

Needless 10 say. the slOre wu.', 
filled with many potent ia l presenb, 
some of which arc too ex pli ~ it to 
describe . However, most of the 
videos, magazines. 10Ys and other 
novelt y ilems were geared toward 
male consumers and did not quite 
til our needs. Not wanting 10 scare 
our young Iriend 100 much, we set-
tled on buying some of the store's 
milder items: X-rated fortune cook-
ies, Mr. Wiggly the wind-up wig-
gling sperm lOy and a "Machi smo" 
magazi ne. which hi ghlights hOI 
Lat; no lovers. 

After returning from our shop-
ping trip, my roommates and I were 
anxious to sec whal kind or reac-
tion we would get from Ih" birth-
day girl, hut we waited until after 
dinner to presenl our surpri ses. 

We kicked thing~ ofT during 
desserl wilh the X-rated forlune 
cookies. They were somewhat dis-

appointing Ihough, considering the 
fact thaI aimosl all of us had the 
same fortune: 'Tight hUllS drive me 
nuts" or " If you think you feel good 
now, wai t unlil you feel me." 

Mr. Wigg ly on the other hand, 
was a huge hit. fl was a riot watch-
ing Ihe lilll c, while, plastic, ~pcrm ­
shaped lOy slink across the table. 

Last bUI not leasl, we carne to 
thc moment we had all been wail-
ing for .. . the opening or 
"Machismo." 

We spent the nex t few minutes 
flipping Ihrough Ihe pages and 
laughing hy~terically al the udd, 
vulgar poses of "Rocky" and Ihe 
other Latin males in the pomo-
graphi l: magazine. We kept wonder-
ing if the men in Ihe magazine were 
products or nature or computer 
imaging. We de.:ided on the latter. 

ur hlrthday presents were a 
~ uccess, bUI one tiling still con-
ce rned me. It was not the fact Ihal I 
had participated in the purchase of 
sexual merchandise. I was not con-
cerned ahout contributing 10 the 

~orruption of a pure and innocenl 
mind, nor was I concerned that our 
present s were really nothing new 
for our !Jot-so-pure-and-innocent 
young friend . What concerned me 
was the lack of availahility of sex u-
al nove lty items for heterosexual 
females. 

earf y all of the videos, maga-
zi nes and toys we encountered 
were designed \0 be enjoyed by 
males. MOSI of Ihe magazi nes and 
videos had large color pictures of 
women exposi ng their large, si li -
cone-en hanced. breasts. I f we hap-

Not wanting to 
scare our young 
friend too much, we 
settled on buying 
some of the store's 
milder Items: X-
rated fortune 
cookies, Mr. Wiggly 
the wind-up wiggling 
sperm toy and a 
"Machismo" 
magazine, which 
highlights hot Latino 
lovers. 
pen cd to come across Videos or 
magazines fealuring nude males, 
Ihey were marketed for gay or 
bisexual men. 

I am not criticizing ei ther of those 
clas~incations of goods, because 
Ihere shou ld always he something 
for everybody, but even most of the 
10Ys were designed to please men. 
For example, lake tlavorcd condoms. 

They mighl be of interest to women, 
bul who rea lly gets pleasure out of 
strawherry-tlavored condoms'} h it 
the women'! I Ihink not. 

In general , it eemed as though 
the numher of pornographic prod-
ucts available for heterosex.ual 
women was small and unbalanced 
compared with the gargantuan 

amounl~ of goodies for men. At 
lirst it ~ccmed to be yet anolher 
example of discrimination againsl 
women, demon~traling lhat gender 
inequa lilies arc still present in 
many aspecls of sl)(;il!ly. Although 
Ihis may he true III some respects, I 
ha ve come to what I believe is a 
more a<.:curate n.:asoning for the 
unbalanced ralios. 

Malcs are more wi lling to huy 
sexual product>, so the ,ex indmtry 

foc u ~l!s more on sat i sfying the 
needs of the majority of it~ con-
sumer,. Store, arc goi ng to ,e ll 
producls that mmt of it~ con, umers 
wi ll huy, and si nce mo,1 consumers 
at adult ,tore~ happen to he males, 
it fo llow~ thaI most of the products 
avai lahle are des igned for men . 

Females tend to he more aroused 
hy mental slimulalion, as oppm,ed 
10 males wh lend 10 get turned on 
hy magazines and rubber 10Ys. For 
women, a signilicant pleasure of 
,ex is the emotional ,ymbol of love 
and the state of mind that coml!s 
with it. The physica l pkasure of sex 

i~ often of greatl!r signilican<.:e to 
men. Because men enj oy Ihe visual 
and tacli Ie aspects of sex 10 a 
greater extent than women, compa-
nies terid to market more products 
for men. 

The proportions of goods avail -
able ror heterosexual women i, 
therefore nOI an indi cator of gender 
inequality, bUI ratha an example of 
the consu mer,' power over the pro-
duction und markering of goods. 

If and when women huy sex.ua l 
products from au~h stores, it is 
more oft en for fun , game, and gal!-
gi rts. ThaI may be a hroad general-
i/.ation, but it wa, confirmed by Illy 
~pea king to lTIany people (mosl 
were too embarrassed 10 he quoted 
in th is article). The bOllom line is 
Ihat men u~ually take the products 
more seri ously for sl!x ual purposes. 
whik women buy them as jokes. 

The fun and games 111 our apart-
ment continued beyond Ihe birth-
day party, as we engaged in a "Porn

What holiday traditions do you 
celebrate? 
Interviews and 
Photography by Lauren Schall 

"We usually go have dimsllm in San 
Francisco, because I'm from the Bay Area, 
and after that we go shopping in Union 
Square. Dimsum is a Chinese food that is 
pre-made and it is put on little ca rts that go 
ar und the restaurant and you just take what 
you want." 

Nick Pullin 
Roosevelt Freshman 

"I celebrate Chri stmas and Kwa nzaa. 
Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday to 
get in touch wi th your roots in Africa and to 
also to celebrate American and African 
American culture. Basically there are seven 
days wi th each day representing a dirferent 
principal. There are seven candIes, like 
Hanukkah, one for each day. Kwanzaa starts 
on the 26th." 

Ashleyrose Gilham 
Marshall Sophomore 

" \ will be going back to Brazil in December 
and there I will ce lebrate Christmas with my 
parents and brothers. On Christmas we have 
a dinner and then ~xchange gi rts and pray t 
God, thanking him for things throughout the 
year, for my health , for my job and for my 
life." 

Paulo Rezende 
Exchange-Student from Brazil 

"I celebrate all holidays . On Christmas my 
whole family gets together and has a big 
dinner. Every year we have it at a different 
relative's house, we all take turns. Usually 
we have about 30 people." 

Craig Tanimine 
Warren Freshman 

" n New Year's we go to my friend 's house 
which is far away from everything. When the 
new year begi ns we blow a conch shell to 
start off the new year."

"Star Wars" 
Continued from page 19 
re lson. George Clooney and John 
Travolta arc only a few of the stars 
in director Terrence Malick', first 
film in 20 years. 

Outlook: While thi s film 
clearl y bears similar themes to la,t 
summer's "Saving Private Ryan," 
it is difficult to say whether one 
will outdo the other. "The Thin 
Red Line" seems to bear the same 
kind of epic story qualit y that suc-
ceeded in "Ryan ." 

Down in the Delta 
Premise: When a woman li v-

ing with her mother and two chil -
dren in the ci ty hegins to sucl:umb 
to alcohol and drugs. her mother

Arlington Road 
Premise: Recent acts o f 

domestic terrori , m ha ve Holly-
wood asking, "What if the terror-
ist, li ve nex t door'!" Hence the 
premise of this ps~c ho l og ical 
thriller about the evil that lurks 
just under the surface of suburbia. 

Vitals: Jeff Bridges stars a~ 
Michael Faraday, who su~pect ~ hi s 
neighbor Oli ver Lang (played by 
Tim Rohhins) of heing a terrori st. 

OUtlook: As much ,l~ thi s film

Vitals: Val Ki I mer stars as

RECORD: 
K Records sticks to 
artistic principles 
Continued from page 13 
COlllest. This record was an impor-
tant influence in the trend of many 
Olympia-hased bands to not use 
bass guitar. This lrend, along with 
experimenlal a cappella songs, is a 
trademark of K relea,es to Ihis day. 

Anolher K Records hand that 
continued the no-bass style (and is 
often given credi t for starting il) 
was Beat Happenings. This hand i, 
cornposed of K Records' founder 
Johnson, Heather Lewis of' 
Supreme Cool Being, and Bret 
Lansford . 

The stripped-down music 01 Ihe 
hand was inspired hy the DIY ae,-
thetic of punk, which Johnson 
thought had hecorne far 100 
restricted in lenns of what musical 
sty lings were allowed, 

"When I was first gelling inlo 
music ." Johnson staled in Magnct. 
" progressive rock - al lea,t 
among pt:ople I was around - wa, 
the thing .... When the hear punk 
rtlt:k for the first time Ithey sayl 

'Oh, that's easy, Anybody can do 
that.' And I'd think 'So what. 
Sounds great. , .. 

The love of what is good and 
si mple carried over to the hand 's 
vocals. Here, Johnson's influences 
included the deep bari tones and 
emotional purity of' Johnny Cash. 

.. It may sound corny, since 
everyone says it, hut the fact is that 
Johnny Cash had incredihly simple 
song thaI jusl gel under your skin. 
And thai really inleresls me," John -
son Slated. 

Thl! Beal Happenlllgs haven't 
recorded ,ince 1991. Currenlly, 
Johnslln \ interest, are celllcr..:d 
around Ihe Duh Narcolic Sound 

SY~lem projecl and the formal Ion 
of hand that shares its name with 
Johnson 's hasement studiO. 

"The idea is to ha e a hou~e 
hand for the studio, kind of like 
Stax or Sludio One in Jamaica have 
done it." he stated. 

The Jamaican inlluence carrie, 
inlO Ihe band ilse lf. 

"Like Jamalcu n Illu~ic , I'm 
reall y inlerested in recycling 
rh ythms for different purpose" 
different songs and differenl 

~ingers ," Johnson ~Ialed . "You celn 

The UCSD Guardian 

have the same rhythm and make 
10 different songs out of it after 
engineers mix down different duh 
versions . " 

K Records recentl y re leased a 
compi lati on CD of tracks thai were 
recorded al Duh arcotic Sound 
System, which included songs hy 
Star Athena, Versus, Jon Spencer 
Blues Explosion and Beck , as well 
as several tracks h the hand Duh 

an:otic ound System. Like all of 
K's releases, Ihe album ignores the 
currenl trends of pop rnu~ic to con-
centrate on allowing the artisls to 
do what they enjoy, 

II is thi , "Slicking to artistic" 
pnndple~ that allowed K Ret:nrds 
10 survive the rise and fall of the 
"grunge" scene in neighboring 
Seallle, as well as the shorter rise 
and harder fall of the "riol grrrl" 
movement right in their olVn lown 
of Olympia. 

"We'd do some interviews, bUI 
mostly we hkw them ofT hecaLl~c 
nohody lin Ihe medial really knew 
whal Ihe} were lalKin g 
ahOlll. ... WIH:n it ", like Joe chmoc 
from ABC. whal do I care 'I" Peder-
~on ~Ialed ahout Ihe pml-Nirvana 
aa.

The UCSD Guardian 

While UCSD Intercollegiate Athletics looks 
ahead to Division If competition in 2000, the 
UCSD Men's Lacrosse team ha moved up to the 
Division I Western Collegiate Lacrosse League for 
the 1998-1999 season, after reaching the Division 
n fi nals last year. 

By winni ng the ov. 14- 15 Jesuit Lacrosse 
Classic hosted by Loyola 
Marymount, UCSD sent a 
message to the rest of the 
league: "We're money." 

UCSD came out big in 
thc opening game and 
dereated the defending 
champions, LM U, 10-4. 
So phomore midfi clder 
Brendan Eckleman had the 
biggest ga me fo r UCSD, 
scoring 3 goals. 

UCSD then played cross-
town rival US D, and 'took it 
int o overtime. But USD's 
fresh legs overcame UCS D's 
power, and USD prevai led 5-4 in 
overtime, 

The loss only fired up UCSD for its third match, 
and UCSD wen t on to beat UCLA, 6-5, 

UCSD's 14 point differential put the squad into 
the title game, agai nst a hungry' UCLA squad that 
looked to avenge it's earlier loss. But UCSD was 
too good, and backed hy goals from attack men 
Frank Lemcs and Evan Old fo rd , UCSD whupped 
UC LA 9-3, for its first-ever championship victory.

SURfiNG 
UCSD used to own collegiate surfing. In the 

past couple years, however, UCSD has found itse lf 
humped hy squads from UC Santa Barbara. 

Thankfully, things are 100lOng up thi s year and 
an National Scholastic Surfing Association title is 
all but possible. 

"UCSD urfing is defi nitely a force to be reck-
oned wi th," Co-Captain Josh "Champ" Rhodes 
said, "We are onl y 12 points away fro m first place 
in the overall team scoring," 

Though the champion~h ip is till in reach, 

Thursday, December 3, 1998 

UCSB still has the upperhand, 
In its latest contest, held on Nov, 22 at 'C' Street 

in Ventura, UCSD surfi ng fi nished behind UCSB 
fo r the second time this season, but it was much 
closer this time, 

Tlte freshmen duo of Holly S eck and Heather 
Long have been the big story on the wo men's side, 
Beck and Long each have one fi rst and one second 
place finish. Long took top honors in Ventura, fo l-
lowed by Bcek who fi nished close behind. 

Garth Enge lhom and Rhodes were the top fin-
ishers for UCSD on the men's side, fini shing 4th 

and 5th overall , respectively. 
In the longboard divis ion, the standout 

was Dylan Jones, who took first place, 
aidcd by a perfect 10 on his first 
wave in the fin al. Freshman Ryan 

Eckoff placed 4th in the longboard 
di vision also. 

" It feels good 10 be back in 
the hunt again," Rhodes said. 
"With the next (;ontest in our 

backyard [La 10lla Shores] . 
we could ve ry well lind our-
selves on top: '

SAILING 
With a new head coach and many new faces, the 

UCSD Sailing team got its season underway Nov. 
14- 15 at the North/South Inte rsectional. The 
Intersectional, which was he ld on Lake Casillas in 
Ojai thi s year, was the first major regatta of the 
year, and a chance to see what kind of strides the 
tea m has made since la t year. 

Against top competition such as UCLA and 
Berkeley, UCSD showed that it ha made many 
improvement since the off-season, The varsity 
team finished s ixth out of 30 boats, while the N 
team came in seventh out of 31 

First-year head coach Peter Alsop hopes ::Iat 
tlti s po itive start will help propel UCSD to its goal 
- a pot in the state champi onships. 

"Our team's strength is unity," team member 
Ryan Krause said, "This weekend 's results refl ect 
our vas t improvement and new ta lent." 

UCS D will now ta ke some time off and concen-
trate on impovement before its next regatta on Jan, 
2 at Long Beach,

THIS IS SPORTS? YOU BET IT IS! 
No doubt about II. It's been a funky last couple of months In big-time sports. With all of the hype. all of the 

money. and all of the baloney that gets tossed around, you'd Ihmk someone would have a clue on how to get 
things right. Bul II seems the more Ihey try, the bigger the mess gets. 

Proof The NFL can 't get therr off iCiating stralghl. .. even Simple things like com-losses. Their teams are also 
playtng a lot 01 medIOcre football. The NBA Whal a lokel

League Baseball finished strong, but off · season player swapping and conttnUlng salary escalations among the 
besl players seem 10 reward no one , except the agenls. Who needs Ihls stuff, right? 

Thank goodness In the real world ... sports stili goes on like It IS supposed to. EspeCially here at the 
U .... where at least a few thousand of us sports Junkies have learned to watch the big stuff from afar, and jump 
Into Ihe real stuff on an every day baSIS. And as the Fall Quarter begins 10 fall away Irom us for another sojourn 
Into final exams and a much deserved holiday break , let us all take lime to rellect on another fun and competilive

Loma azarene College twice 
early this season, the Tritons have 
!.howed they can play. They haw 
won without the presence of a true 
big man in the middle, by u~lIlg 
comhinations of thei r great defense 
and exce llent out side shooti ng. 

Now sCHling in to Ihe season. 

BUI the women wouldn't 
have il that way. and slaged Ihe 
mosl Incredihle comehack I have 

wilne~sed in person. They hat -
tied oad, and graboed game 
three, then game four and were 
unstoppahle in game live. It was 
unbelievah le. It seemed like all 
of CSD was there a Ill) Ihe 
crowd cheered, hollered and 
backed those women through 
every poml. I wouldn' t have 
wanted 10 see a championship 
game in an other way.

CSD will be fed a sleady di et of 
competilive malchups againsl oOlh 
Division III and NAIA schools. 
UCS D will have to show it can sus-
lain this level of play over the long 
haul. The Tritons must continue to 
improve, but the pieces arc seem-
ingly falling into place for thi, to 
he a histori c season for UCSD bas-
kethall. Go Tritons! 

And here we arc a year lat 'r. 
and we're on same ooal. on ly this

TOll1orrow, the TrilOns will takl.: 
on Juniata, and if they win, they 
will rlay lor the title. 

So, in the wake of final 
cams, don 't he down, we have 
something to root for and some-
thing to make us feel good 
about; somelhing to keep our 
heads up; !>omething 10 lighten

game li e~ weeks away, Ihe title 
hunt sweeps into SD twice thi s 
weekend. Both the women 's voi -
le oall leam and the m 'n 's water 
polo leam havc earned spots in 
Iheir resp ctivc Final Fours. 

The women'~ volleyball team 
wi II aHempt to defend its national 
championship at the AA 
Division III Women 's Volleyball 

hampion hips held this weekend 
al Juniata ollege in Huntington, 

Pennsylvania. 
The Tril()n~ face an en()r1l1OU~ 

cha llenge, though. Top-ranked 
Juniala ollege has lost only once 
this season and arc 39-1. However. if 
hi slory repeats itse lf. then the 
Triton~ may oe in good shape. Both 

SD and Juniata have appeared in 
all 18 vo lleyoall championships, hut 
UC 0 holds a 7-1 advanlage over 
the Eagles, including its 19111 win 
over Juniata in the very lirst Division 
III championship miltch. Plus, the 
Tritons have seven titles while th 
Eagles have come up emrty-handed. 

If the Tritons prevail, Ih y will 
play the winner of the oth~rcmiti­
nal -- cntra l ollege (Iowa) vs. 
Wellesley College (Mass.) - for 

the national title. 
In ib lirsl trip to the champi-
()nship.~ since 1995, the men's waler 
polo team will mcet ~ec()nd seeded 

lanford nivcrsity in the scmili-
nals, which will he a daunting task 
in its own right. Earli er thi season 

tanford toppled SO 16-3. 
However, the Tritons have 

improved exponentially over this 
season, and have had many impres-
sive m ments, like the almosl-
upsel over S thaI went down to 
Ihe wire. If UCSD ean get by 
Stanford, it may have an opportuni-
ty for a S remaleh. The top-
ranked Trojan wi II face the 
University of Massa husells in the 
other semifinal malch.
