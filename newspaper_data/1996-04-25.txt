GARAGES WILL

FOR CAMPUS 

PARKERS 

xcuse me, are you 
leaving?" 
How many times 
have you heard this 
question while 

walking through one of the 
UCSD's 71 parking lots? If the 
garages envisioned by Transpor-
tation and Parking Service and 
the Campus Planning Office be-
come a reality, you may never 
have to hear it again. 

Monday, the Guardian looked 
at why UCSD say the garages are 
necessary, and where the univer-
sity wants to build them. Today 
we examine alternative transpor-
tation, future plans and - most 
importantly - how the adminis-
tration plans to pay for it all. 

Naturally, all this construction 
and expansion will require a vast 
pool of funds. Because state law 
prohibits the use of state money for 
parking facilities, the money will 
have to come from other sources.

Questions U C 
Admissions 
INQUIRY: State senator 
investigates integrity of VIP 
special-admissions requests 
By Suketu Valshnav 
Staff Writer 

In response to a bevy of reports by news 
agencies concerning VIP requests in UC admis-
sions processes, the California Senate Select 
Committee on Higher Education held a two-day 
joint inquiry April 19 and 22 to review the 
impact of "special requests" on UC admissions. 

State Senator Tom Hayden, D-Santa Monica, 
chairman of the committee responsible for the 
two investigative inquiries, said he hoped the 
investigation would shed more light on the na-
ture of UC admission favoritism. Hayden openly 
questioned the integrity of the UC admissions 
process by lashing out against various "con-
nected" individuals, including regents, donors 
and other elected officials who used their politi-
cal clout to assist friend or family members in 
obtaining admission to the University of Cali-

I fornia. 
During the hearings, the actions of such 

figures as Regent Leo Kolligian, UCLA Chan-
cellor Charles E. Young, former Regent Wi lIie 
Brown and Regent Ward Connerly were charac-
terized by Hayden as "casting a shadow of 
privilege" over the University of California's 
ideal of breaki.lg down barriers to opportunity 
and promoting diversity. 

UCLA hosted Friday ' s inquiry, which was 
primarily aimed at exposing the special-request 
system which "is not based on fairness or merit, 
but on connections to wealth and power." 

The second half of the hearing, which took 
place the following Monday in Sacramento, 
exposed special admissions treatment through-
out the nine UC campuses. However, at the 
request of the Senate Select Committee on Higher 
Education, only UCLA and UC Berkeley offi-
cials attended the hearing. 

In a March investigation, the Los Angeles 
Times uncovered a UC Berkeley committee 
which dealt specifically with special requests 
from connected individuals. According to its 
members. the UC Berkeley. committee was a 
typical example of the procedures for special 
consideration at UC campuses. Reports of inter-
vention in the admissions process at UC Davis

Staff Writer 

Several A.S. Counci I members met 
with Chancellor-Designate Robert 
Dynes ut lasl night 's meeting al the 
Price Cenler. In an effort to promote 
Increlllicd concern for student issues. 

Dynes. along wi th Interim Chan-
cellor Ma~orie Caserio. Vice Chan-
cellor of Sludent Affairs Ioe Watson, 
and Associate Chancellor Linde 
Nagata. fielded questions from both 
current and incoming A.S. represen-
tative . The admirustrators addressed 
such issues as student outreach. the 
Education Financing Model (previ-
ously known as the Affordability 
Model) and current administrative 
lobbying efforts. 

Newly elected A.S. Commissioner 
or Communications James Fabionar 
asked Dynes how he will approach 
outreach to underrepresented students 
following the UC regents ' approval 
ofSP- l.last summer's measure which 
abolished affirmative-action policies 
in university admissions. 

Dynes mentioned the efforts of a 
recently established outreach com-
miuee, which is presently evaluating 
all of UCSD's outreach programs to 
delermine which are most effective. 

No student representatives cur-
rently si t on this committee. 

"We try to keep the commiuee 
particularl y small so we can actually 
appraise [outreach issuesJ," Dynes 
said. "'However], I would hope al 
some point that we will have student 
input." 

Dynes also expressed hi s desire to 
be directly involved in oUlreach ef-
fo rts. saying he would go "talk to 
people personally." 

Outgoing A.S. President Naomi 
Falk questioned the administration's 
current lobbying efforts in support of 
UCSD interests. 

Caserio spoke aboul her visit lasl

Med C~nter Cuts Are Only 
A Band-Aid Solution 

The recent announcement by UCSD Medical Center adminis-
trators that 500-700 hospital employees will soon have to be laid 
off is a sad indication of problems currently afflicting the U.S. 
health-care industry as a whole. The reasons why this downsizing 
has to occur - and it does have to occur, despite what union 
leaders are saying - point to the root of what 's wrong with 
American health care today. 

Take the UCSD Medical Center, for example. This establish-
ment is the main health-care provider for people living in central 
and southern San Diego. Its beds are regularly filled to over 70-
percent capacity. This figure alone should amount to success for 
uny hospital. But due in part to UCSDMC's central location. the 
poor and the indigent comprise a large percentage of its patients. 
These people use (and sometimes 1Ibuse) the hospital's services 
without giving SO much as a penny back to the system. However, 
UCSDMC can't simply tum away a bleeding man because he is 
on the lower rung of the societal ladder. 

UCSDMC's sister hospital, Thornton, on the other hand, is on 
the opposite end of the spectrum. Serving San Diego's more 
affluent citizens in the northern and coastal counties, this institu-
tion doesn't have a problem with generating funds. This is because 
a majority of its clients have health-care insurance and pay their 
own way. However. Thornton regularly operates at JwJj capadty. 
With so few patients. its staff is scaled back to meet lesser de-
mand. Why does Thornton have this shortage of patients? The 
reason is It\at people in general are embarking on more preventa-
tive-style medicine, joining Heath Maintepance Organizations. 
eating beller - and ultimately staying out of hospitals. 

UCSD Medical Center administrators solved short-term 
financial problems by, laying off workers. But the big question is: 
How does one prevent this layoff "band-aid" from continuing? 
After all, if scaling-back staff persists as the solution to falling 
revenues, UCSDMC will eventually be unable to care for anyone. 

The answers to these problems are far from simple. However, 
they must somehow involve a different way of looking at Ameri -
can health care. (And not sociali zed medicine, which has been 
shown to create more problems than it alleviates in the countries in 
which it has been implemented.) We must consider other options : 
, • 0peIHN ..... medIaII uvI .... funds' 

Personal medical savings accounts have been pushed by Bob 
Dole as iI possible replacement for Medicare. Medicaid and even 
Social Security . These funds would entail fnllllfiillO ry contributions 
from each citizen to his or her personal fund. The contributions 
would be set at a certain percentage of gross income. depending on 
what each individual could afford. The funds could then be 
invested .in various highly profitable ways, from stocks and bonds 
to an interest-eaming bank account. People would be able to keep 
the extra money which wasn ' t used for health care within a certain 
time period. 

• Pwt .. tIDtIon fill public facilities 
Public health-care facilities are currently operating under a sea 

of red ink and a mountain of red tape. As with any enterprises 
undertaken by the g(wemment. they are vastly inefficient. Private, 
non-profit corporations could be enticed. via tax breaks and 
subsidies, to take over the operation of the public hospitals. Thi 
would undoubtedly increase efficiency and quality of care. Private 
corporations (such as drug firms) and private philanthropists could 
also be atU'llCted to contribute medical products and funds through 
such tax incentives. 

.............. " ......... priority 
Currently. most of the hospitals which take care of the poor and 

indigent focus on providing only emergency medical services. 
HMOs have shown that. by focusi.ng efforts on preventive health 
care, overall costs can be reduced over the long haul. Preventive 
care is usually much cheaper 10 administer than emergency 
procedures. Although it would be administered to a larger number 
of people on a consistent basis, preventive care would still pay for 
itself by ~Iy reducing the number of necessary emergency 
procedures - espcci~ly to those without insurance. 

Our country 's leaden should let go of the sinking ship which is 
our current system. With new ideuand leadership. we could all be 
much healthier. both physically and financially . UCSD Healthcare 
should lead the way in pioneering some of these innovative new 
IiOIuIions, and lead the rest of American health care into the 21st 
century.

ethnic-stud ics professors. safe from government op-
pression and censorship in in this "evi l" capitalist na-

it's "people's revolutions," the Chinese government is 
busy crushing free thought in its uni versi ties and on 
the Internet. Beijing has frequently used state'security 
laws to punish anyone that it feel s threatens the rule of 

the Communist Party. Such laws allow 
for long prison te rms and, in some

COMMENTARY: In response to a recent Guardian article bemoaning the fact that students are forced to buy their 
books at Groundwork Books. another student offers a vindication of the non-profit bookstore 

GROUNDWORK BOOKS WORKS FOR STUDENTS 
By Grac.J .... 
Staff Writer 

I am often embarrassed at the sheer 
ignorance and t:rude insensitivity of 
my peers at the GuarrJian. Derek van 
Hoften's commentary on Ground-
work Books is a shining example of 
why most peop1e are disgusted with 
our official campus newspaper. Van 
Hoften often has "nightmares" about 
going to Groundwork Books. and he 
avoids his quarterly trips as much as 
possible, for fear that he might catch 
a sociali st di sease . He belittles 
Groundwork 's noble efforts toward 
working for a better society. 

Mo t students probably do not 
fu lly appreciate Groundwork for be-
ing the magnanimous institution that 
it i!>. The average UCSD student sim· 
ply purchases hi !> or her books and 
leaves . And in thi s rega rd , van 
Hoften's opinion is representative of 
most patrons. 

But while some students are an· 
noyed by the cash-or-checks-only 
policy at Groundwork. they fail to 
realize that the store's refusal of credit 
cards and Plus Cards actually helps 
liS t:ustomers avoid incurring extra 
charges. To cover the cost of install-
ing the necessary hardware to at:cept 
such card, as well as the fee assessed 
by the crediH;ard companies for each 
purchase. the price of book would 
increase by approximately three per· 
u:nl. Groundwork's policy proves that 
it has the "starving student" in mind .. 

In fact . I prefer to buy my books 
through Groundwork. The return 
policy is more lenient than that at the 
UCS D Bookstore. which seems to 
only grant refunds and exchanges for 
the time it takes to exit the front door. 
The Groundwork ·taff is ~.micable. 

helpful, patient and at times a bit too 
trusting. Until this quarter, the tedious 
c heck-writing process van Hoften 
complains about was unnecessary. 
The staff relied on the honesty of its 
customers. until it started to receive 
stolen or bad checks. 

Some say the store is bombarded 
with propaganda. making them hesi-
!ant to enter. The reason for these sen-
ti ments is rather curious. The staff 
members do not preach their ideolo-
gies to those in line. They simply ring 
up the transaction and send you on 
your way. And if you're intimidated 
by that, then perhaps you should bury 
your head in the sand or act as the 
ehild van Hoften has since been com-
pared to: the one that runs far away 
and then stick!> his tongue oul. 

Honest. trusting. non-hierarchical, 
non-authoritarian and open-minded 
- the Groundwork Collective is a 
paradigm of the ideal society. Ground· 
work seeks to provide information 
which is unavailable at other book· 
stores, hoping to change people's con· 
sciousnes so that more will become 
socially aware and strive for positive 
ocial change. 

In a world where individuals are 
fot:used simply on their own wel-
fare . opinions and in terests. 
Groundwork Collective is an excep-
tion. California taxpayers are shell-
109 OUI millions of dollars each year 
to fund the education system at the 
University of California . It is the 
responsible college student 's obli-
gation - not only to him or hersel f. 
but to society as a whole - to learn 
and then to give back. The selfi sh 
graduate simply studies to ea rn a 
degree, find ajob and make money. 
Trying to give something back is

Too left-wing? 
Too In-your-face? 
Soon the call will 
be tor a 
censorship on 
left-wing book., 
and. ban on 
voiced 
opposition to 
government acts. 
Then we'll be Just 
like North Kore •• 
truly the purpose of higher educa-
tion. 

Grou ndwork 's documents 
clarify its goals : "Within Ground-
work, we seek to ,reate a collective 
environment through which we can 
sharpen the skills that will lay the 
groundwork for the society we en-
vision: a society free from discrimi-
nation based on race, ethnici ty, gcn· 
der, creed, sexual orientation. age or 
disability; a cia siess socie ty in 
which all peqple ca n develop to 
their full poten tial . co nt rol their 

Ii ves and determine their future 
within a diverse, supportive and 
critical communiIY." 

Van Hoften went on 10 alla.ck 
Groundwork's social criticism of 
the month: "Free Mumia!" Some 
may be appalled that Groundwork 
seems to condone the acts of a con-
victed criminal. However, the issues 
in this case lie deeper than the mur-
der of a police officer. Groundwork 
is protesting an injustice of the U.S. 
legal system. Undoubtedly, murder 
is wrong. Mumia, however, claims 
he was acting in self-defense, as the 
officer he killed had a gun agai nst 
his brother 's head. 

Critics also argue that Ground-
work is aiming to politicize its cus-
tomers with "propaganda" and a 
plethora of left-wing "babble." They 
complain of being accosted. like-
wise. van Hoften claims that those 
devoted to left-wing politics would 
go so far as to complain that a con-
servative. Christian bookstore on 
campus was auempting to "brain-
wash" students. My answerto those 
on both the left and right wings: 
Mind your own business and let 
people and free-thinking businesses 
be. 

Student . minds arc nOI made of 
malleable clay. Each individual is 
capable of his own level of rat ional 
thought. College is a source of 
knowledge. Courses. books and pro-
fessors only serve to supply students 
with Ihe analytical tools necessary 
for autonomous judgment. indepen-
dent of any brainwashing forces 
which may exist. It is entirely of the 
s tudents ' own accord to select 
which tools they will employ. 

Ultra-conservative, right-wing 

Republicans need not fear imminent 
corruption upon entering such a Ieft-
wing establishments as Ground-
work - you will not be deprived 
of your conservatism. In fact, more 
knowledge of the opposition may 
serve to strengthen whatever stance 
you hold. Knowledge in any form 
is empowering for all agendas. 

Protesting against the existence 
of anything anti-mainstream may as 
well be a call for an Orwellian soci-
ety. The seeds of authoritarianism 
are planted by such complaints as 
van Honen 's. Too left-wing? Too in-
your-face? Soon the call wi II be for 
a censorship on left-w ing books, 
and a ban on voiced opposition to 
government acts. Then we'll be just 
like North Korea. So before publi -
cizi ng such unfounded gri pes, 
people should consider whether 
their arguments are validated by ex-
tensive knowledge of every a peet 
of the issue, or they should at least 
take the other side of the story into 
consideration. 

Van Hoften insinuates that 
Groundwork has not ac;hieved much 
of anything. The Groundwork poli-
tic is one ba ed on aOli.exploi tation, 
one which "oppose any form of ex-
ploitation. whether it be in the form 
of capitalism. racism. exism. age-
ism. looksism or imperialism." 
Working toward a society in which 
people have control over their own 
lives is the collective goa l of those 
at Groundwork. 

Groundwork t:omforts the af-
flicted and afflicts the comfortab le. 
And if people complain that being 
inundated wi th Icft-wing parapher-
nalia is oppress i ve, then Ground· 
work must be succeeding.

GROUNDWORK BOOKS IS HARDLY A MONOPOLY 
Editor: 

Derek van Hoflen's anicle on 
Groundwork Books is thought-pro-
voking ("Groundwork Books Still 
Stuck In The Ground, April 18, 1996). 
However, I feel I must point out a 
weaknes in his aniele. The "fact" 
he mentions to support his emotion-
based article are incooect. He criti-
cizes Groundwork for making him 
feel uncomfortable, yet he fails to 
mention the service that it has pro-
vided to UCSD students since 1974. 
Groundwork Books provides an al-
ternative route for professors to order 
and students to buy books. bypassing 
the UCSD Bookstore. Because it is 
non-profit, it spares students the 
UCSD Bookstore mark-up. 

Van Hoften criticizes the books at 
Groundwork, asserting that "every 
book is about some bizarre, obscure 
and insignificant issue." It is hard to 

contend that the books which the pro-
fessors order are "obscure" or that lit-
erature concerning AIDS or feminist 
theory is "insignificant." He bemoans 
the fact that students have no choice 
but to buy their books at Groundwork 
and asserts that Groundwork Books 
is a monopoly. He is mistaken, how-
ever, as there is Revelle Bargain 
Hooks, which often canies the same 
"obscure" titles required for classes. 
The real book monopoly on campus 
lies within the Price Center. 

Although van Hoften complains 
about having to pay with cash or 
checks. he doesn't acknowledge that 
installing a Plus-Card or credit-card 
machine costs thousands of dollars, 
and that the Plus Card takes a per-
centage of sales as payment. 

Van Hoften al 0 attacks the 
bookstore for its "silly left-wing" 
agenda and describes how he has

nightmares about going to Ground-
work in order to buy books at this 
"embarrassi ng store." It seems to 
me that one of the purposes of at-
tending a unversity is to be exposed 
to different ideas and retain an open 

mind towards those ideas with 
which one does not agree. Having. 
"Free Mumia" printed on receipts. 
doen't seem like an attempt at 
"brainwashing," but at raising con-
sciousness. For most of us, I imag-
ine, it would be intersting to expe-
rience van Hoften's fictitious "right-
wing bookstore." It is unfortunate 
that one has to "suck it up" simply 
to purchase books. 

Groundwork Books, as well as 
the General Store Co-op and 
Revelle Bargain Bool..s, provides a 
much needed alternati~ ~ to the 
UCSD Bookstore. Groundwork 
Books must be applauded for pro-
viding an invaluable and money-
saving service to students for close 
to 22 years .

- --================================================== 

CHINA: Mao's 
communism will 
soon give way 
Continued from paee 4 
fibs about the number of students 
killed by the Red Anny. one thing is 
certain: the communist plutocrats, 
behind the smoked-glas~ windows of 
their limousines and palatial govern-
ment mansions - disconnecled from 
reason, conscience and principle -
wi II not lail another generation. 

Why did the May 1989 protest in 
Beijing fail, when similar peaceful 
demonstralions in Eastern Europe her-
alded the collapse of the Berlin Wall? 

The answer lies significantly with 
Eastern Europe's leaders at the time, 
many of whom were petty bureaucrats 
who drifted into their positions by 
politics, not blCJOdshed. The success 
(to the extent to which you can call it 
that) of China 's campaign against 
freedom has a lot to do with its status 
as the original "revolutionary" clan, 
which waded to power through blood 
alone. Europe's communist bos~es 
faltered when faced with the will of 
the people-and asa result, they lost. 
By contrast. China's leaders did not 
hesitate to shoot down the protesters. 
allowing their regime to survive. 

As discouraging as the current 
situation appears, China's ruthless-

ness will be its own undoing. The 
famines of the Great Leap Forward, 
the heartbreaking destruction of 
priceles art. scroll , books and 
other Irea ures of ancient China in 
the name of the Cultural Revolution, 
the insolent corruption of today 's 
Communist leaders - none of these 
things are forgotten or forgiven . 

Beijing rock musician Cui Jian, 
whose '80s hit "Nothing to My 
Name" evolved to be the anthem and 
rallying cry for a generation of stu-
dents, remained defiant and uncon-
verted in the face of decades of com-
munist propaganda in state-run 
schools. Now banned from playing in 
his home town for seven years, his 

music, mixed with the voices of a 
wearied generation, will topple the re-
gime which the communist bosses so 
painstakingly erected. 

In the freedom-choked land that 
is the United States, pseudo-"revolu-
tionaries" pine for an anti-capitalist 
Maoist order. blissfully ignomnt of the 
real revolution which brews an ocean 
away. No army can stand against an 
idea whose time has come. For the 
12 million Chinese murdered by 
Mao's annies in the name of commu-
nism, for the jailed dissidents who 
dared to criticize the bloated order 
which tore apan a generation of Chi-
nese, the revolution will descend on 
Beijing with the full fury of those 

whose voices were silenced in the 
name of collecti vism. The ancient evil 
that is Mao's legacy will surely see 
an end in this generation, its remnants 
crushed on the anvil of freedom and 
capitalism. Millions of Chinese. 
within and outside its borders. eagerly 
await that day. 

For now, it 's good to know that in 
the last bastion of ignorance we call 
the university, the dinosaurs who nos-
talgically pine for a Maoist order live 
and breathe an idea that has died in 
the country in which it originated. To 
all the Mao-worshipping professors 
and TAs: Take good care of that Mao 
poster. It might be a collector's item 

-one day.

on the passes by the year 2000. The 
authors projected that sub idies could 
increase the number of passes issued 
by approximately 500 to 1,000. 

The UCSD Vanpool Prograrncon-
sists of 26 IS-passenger vans, which 
transport approximately 400 people 
per month. Riders pay foroperJtional 
costs, while administrative costs are 
subsidized by the university. The draft 
provides that UC D would subsidize 
o percent of operational costs afler 

1998, predicting that the subsidy will 
increase the number of riders by 250 
during the next 10 years. 

The hourly CampuslMedical Cen-
ter shuttle currently transports people 
from the UCSD Medical Center in 
Hillcrest to campus. The draft pro-
poses to increase the frequency of 
trips to once every half hour, and to 
keep the service free of charge.

One bus would carry riders between

other would provide scrvice between

The six-bus Commuter Express 
shuttle, proposed for 1996-97, would 
provide service between the campus 
and Oceanside, Escondido. Fashion 
Valley, North County Fair. Nati nal 
City and Paci fic Beach. Passengers 
would pay 25 percent of the cost of the 
service. 

As an offshoot of the Commuter

shuttle service would usc the same 
buscs during non-commute hours to 
provide free transportation to loca-
tions within 15 minutes of campus.

The UCSD Graduate Student As-
sociation (GSA) Counci! passed a 
resolution against the dr .. n Monday 
by a vote of 19-0, with two absten-
tions. According to its statemenl, the 
GSA believes "the UCSD commu-
nity would be beuer off without park-
ing structures ... [because] the UCSD 
community would face pennit fees 
even higher than those envisaged in 
the report." 

"Our position is that they' re bet-
ting $25 million on growth projec-
tions that are uncertain at best," GSA 
President Steve Dubb said. "We think 
the transportation needs of this cam-
pus can be met much cheaper without 
building parking stllfctures." 

According to Soee and Borsa, if 
the university decides to build the 
structures, a Building Advisory Com-
mittee composed of students, faculty 
and staff membel . will make recom-
mendation to a Campus/Community 
Planning Comminee. The recommen-
dations will then be forwarded to the 
chancellor and to the UC regents. who 
will then make a final decision.

"We haven't scheduled any 
further inquiries as of yet - we 
are waiting to see what the re-

Rubin. a consultant to the State 
Select Commilleeon Higher Edu-
cation. 

Hayden a~rused hi s oppo-
nents of "downplaying the num-
ber of VIP cases and denying the 
fact that the system is designed 
to raise money or curry favor." 

The state committee lacks the 
authority to make mandates 10

can only make recommendations. 
However. the commilleecontrols

Hayden made recommendations 
for reform In admission~ proce-
dures throughout the UC system. 

He called for the regents to adopt 
a "Code of Ethics" - a state-
ment of admis~ions policies de-
claring that "the admissions pro-
cess be free of politicaJ influ-
ence." 

In addition, Hayden requested 
the "prohibition of outside com-
munications on normal admis-
sions processes by donors or 
other officials with influence." 
as well as a restructured appeals 
process for those students ini-
ti ally rejected. 

Despite the recent findings. 
certain university officials still

Senate Chair John Wheeler

"[Dynes' ) standing as a scientist

said. 

Dynes, the current senior vice 
chancellorof academic affairs, made 
a brief speech before the senate about 
his coming term as chancellor. He 
will assume the new position on 
July I. 

" I am tru Iy excited by the pros-

UCSD to a "space shuttle about to 
fire its boo ter rockets." 

Dynes requested that student and 
faculty help contributean additional

"This is a very, very, very good 
campus," he said. "We can make it 
a great campus together." 

Dynes also congratu lated Caserio 
for being "firm but gentle" over the 
past academic year in "guiding

There's a distinct irony behind a 
punk band singing "slupid. lazy. 
can 't hold a job." 

Ironic or not. GUllermouth 's 
second album, Ter; Yakimolo, 
comes off Ali a strong effort for the 
California punk band. 

Ounennouth returns to some of 
its early, thrashy sound in Teri Yaki· 
molo. The new release, in fact, 
offers nothing particularly new. It 
offers a strong compilation of the 
band's pasl music and sound. 

Guttennouth follows in the 
NOFX-punk school of lyricism: 
make fun of everybody different 
than you. 

In Teri Yakimoto. the band 
in ~ult s hippies, vegetarians and 

, even other punks. This makes for a 
somewhat negative vibe behind the 
album. 

All in all. the band's second 
release reflects a stronger sound. It 
also is one of the better albums 
coming out of California's hard· 
core punk scene.

In 1977. Culture released its 
brilliant first album. Two Sevens 
Clash. Bright. young and talented. 
the band followed up with anum· 
ber of strong albums, includmg 
BaJdhead Bridge and International 
Herb. 

Culture's string of successes 
established them as one of the pre-
mier reggae groups of all time. Its 
latest effOl1, One SIoM, keeps true 
to its reggae roots while progress-
ing with the times. 

The band's strength lies in its 
striking yocalist, Joseph Hill. With 
lyrics that are both relevant and 
poignant, Culture utilizes its trade-
mark harmonization. 

The only downside to Cullure's 
latest release is its rhylhm section. 
which fails to support the passion' 
ate yocals. Otherwise, One Slone 
continues a tradition of albums 
with penetrating messages and 
pleas. 

Culture will perform at the 
Belly Up Tavern on May 17.

Lislening to Mecca Normal's

Poodlt. after cutting my teeth on 
their earlier albums is akin to tast· 
ing "New" Coke aller enjoying 
Classic Coke all my life: It may be 
sweeter, but ROt necessari Iy beller. 

Jean Smith's famous vocals, 
which can range from banshee to 
purr, have been polished to an 
accessible croon, and David 
Lester's harsh but brilliant guitar 
orchestrations have gone the way 
of colorless strumming. 
• Certain tracks, like "When You 

Build a House With No Doors," 
pay tribute to the band's richly 
textured musical competency, but 
the rest fail to inspire. 

Mecca ~nnal's 1994 addition 
of Peter Jeffries and his standard 
rock drumbeats brings their music 
perilously close 10 common. To 
witness a band with a history of so 
much lyrical and musical profun-
dity slip into mediocrity is a 
tragedy.

Little Stars Hung Upside Down

•• 

Geuing through the firsl few 
songs of Beatrice Nine's debut 
album UIlII! Stars Hung Upsitk 
Down is a challenge. The album 
features a few strong songs, shuf-
fled in with many superfluous, 
redundant ones. 

Beatrice Nine's songs consis-
tently begin with a burst of inge-
nuity lhat is interesting, and even 
capti vati ng. 

However, the band rapidly 
loses its edge from there. Most of 
the songs make the listener both 
uneasy and miffed at the stupid 
lyrics. 

Nonetheless, innovative songs 
like "Salamander Suite" and 
"Bare Bulb," wilh whisper-sung 
vocals and flamenco-style guitar 
make the album worlh a listen. 

Also mixed in wilh the weaker 
material are some' fascinating 
musical textures and catchy pop-
rock beats. 

Beatrice Nine will perform at 
Brick by Brick tonight.

The Verve Pipe's latesl release, 
Villain, successfully mixes twinges 
of melancholy and happiness in a 
small vocal package. 

Songs like "Photograph" and 
"Cattle" sum up the simplicity and 
sincerity of the band 's music. Over-
all, the album combines comple-
mentary rock and melodic tones. 
However, finding meaning in the 
band's obvious attempts at poetic 
justice may be jusl as hard as find-
ing meaning in the group's name. 

The Verve Pipe's laid-back 
sound doesn't heckle you to death 
or fesler in your head - a rarity in 
today's music. Instead, it succeeds 
in supplying good. entertaining 
tunes without being outrageously 
brash or boring. Their music offers 
a smooth blend of soft rock and 
alternative. as well as "easy listen-
ing," Songwriter Donny Brown 
says that the band "avoids pre-
dictability at all costs" - but pre-
dictability is part of The Verve 
Pipe's successful sound.

crisp voice is like seeing the 
U.S.S ArilolUl sunk in the crys-
tal-clear waters of Pearl Harbor 
- it makes you wish there was 
some murk to hide the ship-
wreck. 

Every track on Shot finds the 
band al their best. "Skull of a 
German" is an incendiary num-
ber highlighted by guitarist 
Duane Deni son 's delirious and 
jangly guitar, as well as the tight 
interplay between bassist David 
William Sims and drummer Mac 
McNeilly. 

"Too Bad About the Fire" is a 
creeping song launched from the 
gut of Sims ' bass guitar that 
showcases unnerving lyrics such 
as "I've killed 12 limeys this 
yearlI ' ve had a very bad day/I 
blew my family away." 

The most interesting track on 
the Lizard ' s latest effort is 
·'Trephination." on which the 
band recreates a phone conversa-
tion between a person having a 
nervous breakdown and another 
who is trying to calm them down. 
It sounds like the con versation is 
taken straight from the suicide 
hotline.

Empsror Tomato Ketchup 

EIIIin ......

•••• 

On Emperor Tomato Ketchup, 
the ground·breaking Euro-French 
group Stereolab has successfully 
composed a handful of new songs 
{hat explore obsessions through 
lyrics and exude charm with the 
use of a Farfisa organ. 

Led by the romantic and skill -
ful partnership of Tim Oane and 
Laetitia Sadier, Stereolab's quirky 
tunes provide an embellished 
background for airy French lyrics 
and give Ihe album an almost 
ambient sound. 

"Percolator" and "Spark Plug" 
are two of the songs off the album 
which fulfill Stereolab's reputa-
tion as a pop. beat band. 

Although the various electron-
ic sounds are carefu lIy construct-
ed. some of the songs seem to 
have a raw nature to them. Lucki-
ly. this bit of ariistic license isn't 
taken too far. 

A large portion of the music is 
fueled by Moog synthesizers, a 
Vox organ and various other elec-

tronic devices from the 60s and 
70s. A few ofi he tracks, such as 
the album's opener, "Metronome 
Underground," . also use loops 
from old jazz records. The song 
takes its name from the 
metronome pluck prevalent 
throughout the tune. In the end, 
the various samples creatively 
individualize the album's songs 
from one another. 

Overall. Emperor Tomato 
Kt lChup pleases the ears with 
flippant lyrics and pleasant tunes. 
The band's synthesizers and 
organs display its eccentricity and 
talent in the studio . 

However, it remains to be seen 
if Stereolab will be able to pro· 
duce the same kind of dynamic in 
front of an audience. 

Stereolab will perform with 
Prolapse and Trackstar at Brick 
by Brick on Friday at 9 p.m.

The Music BOl 
University Art Gallery exhibit 

features sounds from music boxes 
By Holland Gallup 
Guardian Reporter 

The strange, high-pitched noises heMd near 
the Hump lately are actually coming from the 

""University An Gallery. The current exhibition. 
"'The Music Box Project" features 17 
music boxes created by contempo-
rary artists such as Laurie Anderson 
and the late John Cage. Each artist 
constructed the outside housing of 
the music box and then either com-
posed or selected a melody from a 
given playliSl for the bo" to play. The 
result is a visually interesting amy of 
works that offer music to the ears -
and eyes. 

~ show connects sounds and objects 
through the manipulation of the music-box 
fonn. The traditional box with the ballerina on 
top spinni", 10 "A Small WorId" is forsaken in 
flvor of more challengina crulions. 

For eumplc, .nist ViID Aa:onci creared I 

clear vin>:1 vest with 30 pockets that can actual-
ly be wom. [nside each pocket is a music-bo" 
mec.hanism. When the pockets are opened, the 
music begins to play; close the pockets and the 
sounds stop. 

Unfortunately, these are "worlcs 
of art" and are not for public han-
dling. The gallery does, however, 
provide tours di rected by white-
gloved docents who will play the 
boxes upon request. On busy days, 
the noise can be quite confusing, 
making it difficult to focus on each 
box 's peculiar sounds. It is recom-
mended that one experiences this 
show when there are few visitors. 
~ show is an intriguing view of a form not 

usually usociated with contemporary an. 
Although the ex.hibit's theme is reminiscent of 
I trip to Grandma's house. the resulting exhibi-
tion is the CQIIlplete opposite. The exhibit runs 
throu,h June .

-Mrs. Winterbourne 
Lake gives Cinderella story unexpected 1990s twist 

By ...... H .. 
Staff~er 

The Cinderella of 1996 has a baby out of 
wedlock. prefers the polka to the waltz and 
looks a lot like Ricki Lake. Meet 
Mrs. Winterboume.

elicit giggles and a few suppressed smiles. 
On the thumb scale, perhaps the film

deserves neither a thumbs up or 
thumbs down, but a knuckle. 

Had it not been for a love story 
occurring between the lines, this 
movie might have all but drowned 
in the dregs of generic ism. 

Winterboume. the main chMacter 
isn' t really Mrs. Winterboume. 
she simply pretends that she is. 
Her name used to be Connie 
Doyle. She used to sleep in the 
subway station. She used to be 
penniless. That was all before a 
chauffeur. in a case of mistaken

series "China Beach." needs to

identity. drove her straight to the doorstep of 
the opulent Winterboume mansion. 

From there. all the tried-and-true but less-
than-sophisticated formul as for a comedic 
rags-to-riches story ensue. A bumbling din-

Her acting only starts to get better when 
she is opposite Brenden Fraser. He is amaz-
ing as always and. with Lake. the chemistry 
works. He plays Bill Winterboume. a stuffy 
business man who doesn' t know how to 

enjoy life. Lake's chMacter, on the other 
hand, is a charismatic vagrant who doesn't 
have the means to live. 1be unexpected 
romance that evolves goes from funny and 
awkward to endearingly real. 

And another unexpected relationship 
evolves during the film - one between a 
mother and daughter. Connie Doyle lost her 
mother as an infant. Bill 's wealthy mother 
(Shirley MacLaine) has had everything she 
ever wanted. except a daughter. 

These moments of mother-daughter 
bonding might make this movie a good one 
to consider taking Mom to for Mother's Day. 

Mrs. Winterboume is a cute. light-hearted 
comedy fea turing nothing terribly original or 
poignant. If you don't mind bad acting. view 
it as a feel·good story to save for a rainy day. 

M rs, Winterbollme is playing at theaters 
throughout San Diego.

of the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial 
in Washington. D.C. [ts proposed 
design was J1O( an 8O-foot bronze

nor a similar traditional

It was a gianL sunken 
granite slab that led one 
down into the earth and 
back up again, through 
thousands of engraved 
names of men who died in 
Vietnam. Many veterans 
were disturbed by ils simplicity and

Un: Architect of Vietnam Veteran memorial subject of documentary. 
nese-American named Maya Lin. 

The 1995 documen· 
tary film about this 
woman. Maya Lin: A 
Strong Clear Vision. 
e1thumes these evenls to 
provide new insight on 
the creative and political 
movements involved in 
the creation of this coo-
troversial monument. It 

also describes the continuing devel-
opment of the artist who has since 
become one of the most prominent 

of our time. 
The film succeeds in acting 

equally both as a biography of Lin 
as an artist and as a historical 
account of the events surrounding 
her work. The controversy which 
was ignited when she won lhe 
design competition for the Vietnam 
Memorial is given lots of exposure, 
and the audience is given a real idea 
of the heavy politics that lies behind 
an of this historical nature. 

Maya Un will be shown at the 
Ken Cinema. from April 25-27. 

Cats & Dogs 
Garofalo and Thurman 

co-star in romance-comedy 
By Dan Okada 

Staff~er 
The recent wide pread prolifera· 

tion of "on-line relationships" adds 
an interesting twist to the 
everyday quagmire of dat-
ing. After all, both people 
don't know what the other 
looks like. 

This is the very same 
dilemna brought up in 
Janeane Garofalo'S new 
movie, The Truth About 
Cars and Dogs. 

Abby Barnes (Garofalo) is the 
virtually ideal woman. She's an 
intelligent and witty veterinarian 
with a successful talle·radio show. 
Unfortunately, her ordinary appear-
ance leaves her completely ignored 
in the department of romance. 

Brian, a perplexed photographer 
(Ben Chaplin) who calls in for a 
problem with a jittery, roller-skating 

Great Dane. is instantly captivated 
by Abby' charm and asks to meet 
her. In a moment of impulse, Abby 
describes herself as appearing tall, 

blonde and "hard to 
miss," just like her neigh· 
bor Noelle (Uma Thur-
man). Abby has no inten-
tion of actually meeting 
Brian. 

Ins~d, when she is 
finally forced to come 
face· to· face with Brian. 
Abby asks Noelle to take 

her place. This switch triggers a 
series of lies and confusion between 
the threesome. 

Cars And Dogs offers many 
entertaining scenes and moments, 
primarily fueled by Garafolo's wry 
and witty humor. 

The Trurh About Cats and Dogs 
opens at theaters throughout San 
Diego tomorrow.

! UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
I Women's Lacrosse 

Just as the Washington Generals 
have been the pereMiaI doormats of 
the Harlem Globetrouers,the UCSO 

., 

women's I~rosse team 
• has assumed the same 

role against its arch-ri-
val. UC Santa Barbara. 
The di fference between the 

Generals and Tritons is that UCSO 
has actually played other oppo-
nents, and the team's success 
against them makes its losses to the 
Gauchos all the more frustrating. 

Last Saturday, however. the Tri-
LOns bested their nemesis from up 
north for the first time ever. In a 
down-to-the-wire tho ller. the UCSD 
squad squeaked past the Gauchos, 5-
4. 

For UCSD. theolTense came from 
a quanet of players. Katie Galvin, 
Sian Beilock and Chris Moll each 
tallied a single goal to aid the cause. 
Amy Haselfeld, meanwhile, led lhe 
team with two scores. Their five-
goal total was just enough to earn the 
Triton lacrosse team its first-ever 
victory over UCSB. after seven years 
of defeats. 

The Bell tolls: UCSO's Marisa Bell (front right) goes for the ball 
against UCSB, as Angel Lopresti (5) looks on. 

The defense was anchored by 
Shannon Northrup and goalkeeper 
Kristin Madigan, who swept away 
more shots than than their excited 
bench could count. 

The win secured second place in 

league for the Tritons and earned 
them a playoff remalch with UCSB 
this Sunday on Prytel field at War-
ren. The action will get underway at 
I p.m.

Roberts and Brian Bazzel make

"They have players on their

and so other Division 111 schools 
are at a disadvantage," Wydra 
said. "But we have a balanced

playing really well lately. 

" Our biggest advantage is that 
we've been playing lop-notch

"If I had a choice of having 
one or two star players instead of 
five or six good players that play 
as a team, I would pick the [Ialler) 
any day," Wydra said . "Anyone 
can shoot well for us on any given 
day . 

"On other teams, player's egos 
and the fact that they are playing

UCSO's well-balanced team 
will go up against Skidmore 
(N .Y .), Allegany (Penn.) and 
John Carrol (Ohio) in hopes of 
repeating ils national champion-

With this current group of golf-

It makes the Master, US Open, and every other major look 

like a weekly outing at Lawrence Walk's Leisure World, The best field 
of the year on the best courses in San Diego. What are we talking 
about? UCSD's Major, the AII-Campus Championship Tournament. 

You don't need to have a single digit handicap to get involved 
in the 1M Tour. The opening round always features a wide variety of 
swings. Just because your swing looks more like a steam shovel than 
a PGA Pro shouldn't keep you from getting in on all the action. This 
three day event really gets down to business on Saturday and Sunday. 
The field is cut in half after the opening round and again after round 2. 
Some have called this 1M Sports toughest title to win .. .in any sport. 
The first round will be played at the challenging Eagle Crest Golf Club. 
Those that make it to Round 2 will tee it up at Carlton Oaks CC. For the 
championship final round on Sunday, we move to Singing Hills Golf 
Resort. 

This year's toumament as in years past will feature two com-
petitive divisions. Undergraduate students compete for one title while 
the UCSD 1M Legends (grad students, staff, faculty, alumni, celebrities, 
and special exemptions) will swing for their own @e. We will also have 
special long drive and closest-to-the-pin competnions, so nearly any-
one can walk off with a prize. 

David Trenski is the defending champ in the Undergrad divi-
sion, and a strong legends field should be chasing Jon Garza who won 
by one stroke last year in the most exciting finish in event history. 

So how do you get involvedl Sign-ups at RIMAC (4th Floor, 
1M Desk) are currently under way, so don't waste time. Space is lim-
ited. Your $30 entry fee includes green fee, gon cart, prizes, and re-
freshments . It's a can't miss for hackers and scratch guys alike. First 
tee time on Friday is 1 :3Opm ... we hope to see you all there. For addi-
tional information call 534-3716 between lOam and 4pm.

BySe .. R .... mI 
Associate Sports Editor 

Jason Aguilar: He ' s a senior centerfielder for 
the UCSD baseball team. The rundown: He 's a 
speedy outfielder who covers a lot of ground. a 

smart base runner and a good hiUer. 
Now you can add home-run slug-

ger to his profile. after Aguilar hit 
his first career long ball yesterday 
to help the Tritons defeat Concordia. 
8-5. 

And although sophomore Mark 
Mason's two-run home run in the 
second inning was important, this 

day belonged to the seniors - as well it should. 
Four seniors (in addition to Aguilar) contributed 
to the victory. as they played in their last home 
game in a blue and gold uniform. Yet. despite the plethora of 

professional sports contests 
slaged each day. the most 
exciting element of the spring 
season for many is none other 
than our very own intramural 

adv~ntures. On the "fields of 
dreams" at UCSD. the fever 
has turned into an epidemic. 

Lefty Mike Bryant picked up the win in relief, 
and John ''IT.'' Titchen continued his perfect 
pitching in the set-up role. Carl Abramson went 
2-4 on the day with two runs. two doubles and 
two RBI. Bobby Arban picked up an RBI and 
made stellar plays from right field. including a 
bullet throw to catch Eagle Chris Kindreich try-
ing to advance from first to third base on a single. 

Back to the baC: Although on this play UCSO's Jason Aguilar had to dive back to first, he 
later trotted around the bases. after hitting his first home run as a Triton. 

UCSD tied the contest at two in the bottom 
half of the second inning when Abramson led off 
by lacing a double to left-center. ChucUohnson' s 
ground out to second base moved Abramson to 
third. but Chris Rondestvedt could not pick up 
him up, grounding out sharply. The Tritons needed 
a key hit, and Mason delivered in a big way with 
his first home run of the season. Mason 's blast to 
left-center cleared the wall despite the strong 
winds which often ki II potential homers off right-
handed batters. 

pitch. Lately I've been feeling better at the plate." 

For me. the adventures 
begin, as always, with a time-
honored tradition - the 
following pre-season speech: 

"If you pukes don ' t shell 
out five bucks each for that 
entry fee . I'm gonna have to 
bust some bUllS!" 

Aguilar led the charge,though, going 3-4 with 
a triple. single and home run - knocking in two 
runs and scoring two runs. 

In the game. Concordia struck first. scoring 
single runs in the first two innings. Freshman 
starter David Takehara was wild early, walking 
the first two batters he faced. He got out of that 
inning by striking out the Eagles' best hitter. 
Derrick Bly, but lasted only one more inning. 

The Eagles came back with another run in the 
top of the fourth, but UCSD followed suit in the 
bottom half of the inning with a run of its own. 
Again, Abramson led offthe inning with a double, 
this time over the left fielder's head. After ad-
vancing to third on Johnson's fly out, Abramson 
came around to score on Rondestvedt's sacrifice 
fly to knot the game at three. Bryant entered the 
contest in the top of the fifth and recorded three 
straight outs to keep the contest tied at three. 

That said. the season gets 
underway . And if you thought 
the NBA playoffs were 
inlense. then look out. 

"I thought it was going out at first, but then I 
realized that the wind could bring it down," 
Mason said. "I was looking fastball on the first
