U N I V E R S I T Y  O F  C A L I F O R N I A ,  S A N  D I E G O

By Neda Oreizy
Senior Staff Writer

One year after the UC Board of 
Regents first grappled with a proposed 
ban on tobacco corporation funding 
for university researchers, it approved 
a new resolution which serves as an 
act of compromise — providing more 
oversight over the controversial awards, 
but opting not to reject them entirely.

The resolution, which passed 14-
4 at the regents’ Sept. 20 meeting, 
addresses concerns of both sides of 
the long, heated debate. Proponents 
of the ban have been concerned about 
the moral and reputational hazards of 
tying the university to tobacco com-
panies that have engaged in unethical 
corporate practices, while the other 
side believes that restrictions on aca-
demic freedom would be more dan-
gerous.

Instead, the new policy invokes 
more oversight and “sunshine mea-
sures” to improve transparency with 
future awards from tobacco compa-
nies. Specifically, a scientific review 
committee will be assembled to evalu-
ate the research and provide a recom-
mendation, which will then be passed 
on to the school’s respective chancellor 
for approval. The regents will receive 
an annual report and notice of each 
proposal.

The action item initially proposed 
by Regent John J. Moores had addi-
tional research oversight and fund-
ing approval provisions for the regents 
themselves, but several regents opposed 
those measures on the grounds that 
the board would potentially be “micro-
managing.” 

“This is a dangerous area,” Regent 
Frederick Ruiz said. “I think it is bad 
governance for the regents to be trying 
to micromanage something like this. I 
mean, what’s next? Nuclear energy, oil, 
stem-cell research, gene therapy, birth 
control, abortions? ... I don’t think this 
is our job.”

Ruiz, one of the four dissent-
ing votes on the resolution, had also 
advised the regents that the issue was 
one for the UC Academic Senate to 
decide, reminding the board that the 
senate had overwhelmingly rejected 
the ban in May by a 43-4 vote.

Despite impassioned warnings by multiple 
regents that raising tuition prices of graduate 
schools would defame the foundation’s reputation 
for accessible education, UC committees on edu-
cational policy and finance approved a significant 
increase in graduate school fees at the Sept. 20 UC 
Board of Regents meeting.

The hike is expected to drastically impact the 
university’s 33 graduate programs, including the 
UCSD School of Medicine, the Skaggs School of 
Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and the 
Rady School of Management.

Although other fee increases were enacted ear-
lier in the decade, the regents said that budget cuts 
have prevented graduate schools from offering 
competitive faculty and staff wages.

The 13-5 vote determined that graduate tuition 
fee increases — a minimum of 7 percent annually 
for the next three years — must be implemented 
in order to continue the university’s quality of 
graduate programs. After the 2008-09 academic 
year, deans from each graduate school must pres-
ent annual graduate fee assessments to the regents 
for evaluation for the following two academic 
years. These future petitions for fee increases will 
take into consideration the fluctuating demands 
for staff necessities such as improved supplies and 
facilities, program expansions and faculty salaries.

“The foundation of the university is our qual-
ity, and we are at a crossroads,” Regent Judith 
Hopkinson said at the meeting. “The state support 
that we’ve had in [previous] decades we don’t have 
anymore, so we have to come up with alternatives 

to that approach.”
The majority of UC graduate school deans felt 

that the proposed increase was adequate to sustain 
their programs and maintain access to their schools 
— a move that requires a larger faculty and improv-
ing salaries along with an increase in financial aid, 
UC Office of the President spokesman Ricardo 
Vazquez said.

Council Taps Exernal Manager 
to Run Indebted Grove Caffe

By Sonia Minden
Associate News Editor

While the Grove Caffe remains 
a treasured part of campus history, 
its recent encounters with finan-
cial problems have persisted in con-
junction with unstable management 
— two unresolved and increasingly 
pressing issues that plague UCSD’s 
first coffee shop.

The future of the Grove seemed 
tentatively positive at the end of 
last year. As the A.S. Council and 
Grove staff members worked to 
forge a partnership with graduate 
students of the UCSD Rady School 
of Management, it appeared that the 
Grove had found a compromise that 
would preserve it as a student-run 
enterprise.

However, any prospective ties 
with the Rady School have now been 
severed, and the A.S. Council has 
instead elected to appoint an exter-
nal manager to regain control of the 
shop’s weakened finances, hoping 
that doing so will ensure a much-
needed stability for the struggling 

Year-long saga ends as 
board opts for heavier 
oversight of university 
research funds linked to 
tobacco companies.

After UC Irvine’s chancellor ignit-
ed a heated debate by withdrawing 
a contract that would have made a 
renowned liberal legal scholar dean of 
the campus’ nascent law school, both 
men are extending the olive branch 
as they ponder the consequences that 
their off-again, on-again relationship 
may have on the school’s future.

On Sept. 11, UC Irvine Chancellor 
Michael V. Drake stirred a nation-
wide debate on academic freedom 
when he voided a contract with 
Duke University law professor Erwin 
Chemerinsky as the new law school’s 
dean. Chemerinsky, a distinguished 
law professor who was named by 
Legal Affairs magazine as one of 
America’s top 20 legal thinkers, said

Safety Month 
Culminates in 

New Technology, 
Emergency Drill

By Gina McGalliard
Contributing Writer

With memories of the April 
massacre at Virginia Polytechnic 
Institute and State University still 
fresh in the national mindset, UCSD 
highlighted many recent precau-
tionary measures — including 12 
new safety towers and an emergency 
drill to measure and augment emer-
gency response efficiency — dur-
ing September, as part of “Campus 
Preparedness Month.”

Administrators held a kickoff 
safety expo on Sept. 13 at Price 
Center, which featured speakers on 
a wide variety of topics, as well as 
booths from UCSD and off-cam-
pus vendors. Some dealt specifically 
with the safety of those at UCSD, 
such as the Campus Emergency 
Response Team and the UCSD 
Police Department.

Others, such as the Red Cross, 
featured general safety issues such 
as fire prevention, how to recover

UCSD Team Develops 
Wi-Fi Troubleshooting 

A team of UCSD graduate 
students and professors has 
developed an automated 
troubleshooting system to more 
quickly identify problems with 
wireless Internet connections. The 
experimental system currently runs 
24 hours a day in the Computer 
Science and Engineering Building, 
reporting any problems within 
the building’s wireless network. 
However, there are no plans to 
expand the troubleshooting system 
outside of the building at this time.

“Our system is based on a 
research infrastructure unique to 
the CSE building,” CSE professor 
Stefan Savage, one of the project 
leaders, said in an e-mail. “We 
installed almost 200 radio monitors 
throughout the building to provide 
complete and ubiquitous coverage. 
Deploying that kind of specialized 
infrastructure more broadly simply 
isn’t cost-effective.”

However, the team hopes that 
its research will ultimately lead to 
improved wireless networks with 
radio monitors “integrated into 
the access points themselves, 
eliminating the need for a specialized 
infrastructure,” Savage said.

Yu-Chung Cheng, a UCSD 
graduate student and leading 
author for the project, said he was 
hopeful that the group’s features 
would later become more widely 
implemented in other projects. 

“I envision future Wi-Fi 
protocols will build in the features 
we recommended in our papers,” 
Cheng said.

Savage said that this process is 

already underway.
UCSD students can also expect 

to see some improvement in the 
campuswide wireless network due 
to the automated system.

“As we identify the common 
causes of problems in the CSE 
building, this experience is beneficial 
to the rest of campus that operates 
on a network that is generally the 
same,” Savage said.

Early Detection Could 
Prevent Psychosis

Pinpointing the symptoms of 
mental disorders at an early stage 
could prevent their traumatizing 
effects, according to researchers 
with the Cognitive Assessment and 
Risk Evaluation program at UCSD. 

C.A.R.E. attempts to identify 
and evaluate changes in thoughts, 
behavior and emotions that might 
signal the development of mental 
illnesses, such as schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder. Its services are both 
free of charge and confidential.

Approximately 25 to 30 percent 
of individuals displaying early symp-
toms of serious mental illnesses 
become psychotic within a year, 
the researchers said. Warning signs 
range from hearing voices and see-
ing visions to social withdrawal and 
anxiety.

The program’s participants are 
assessed by UCSD physicians and 
must be between 12 and 30 years 
of age. After enrollment, they receive 
two years of regular clinical and 
cognitive assessments. C.A.R.E. 
also provides free resources such 
as psychiatric consultation, social 
services and education for the indi-
vidual and his or her family.

financially after a disaster, how to 
prepare for a terrorist attack and 
what to do in the event of an auto 
accident. Other topics, such as vari-
ous ways to prevent being injured 
on the job, were geared toward cam-
pus employees.

Many of the vendors showcased 
security upgrades, such as California 
Institute for Telecommunications 
and Information Technology emer-
gency broadcast system in the form 
of a marquee, which will notify stu-
dents in the event of an emergency 
and give advice on how to proceed. 
According to Cal-(IT)2 Project 
Support Coordinator Vanessa Pool, 
they hope to eventually have them 
installed in all large lecture halls on 
campus. 

Another vendor, San Diego-
based MIR3, has created an emer-
gency notification system via e-mail, 
text messaging, phone and pager. In 
the case of an emergency, those who 
have signed up will receive notifica-
tion telling them what the event is, 
what to do and when the event is 
over, said Senior Account Executive 
Ray Gantney.

The system will call all phone 
numbers provided by the user three 
times, or until the user answers the 
phone. If the user does not pick up 
after the attempts, the system will 
send a text message to the user’s 
cell phone warning him or her that 
there is an oncampus emergency. 

“The problem with texts is that 
they’re slower to send, and some cell 
phone providers charge to receive 
them,” Emergency Services Manager 
Phillip Van Saun said.

Students can volunteer their con-
tact information on the Office of 
Environmental Health and Safety 
page of UCSD’s Web site. Van Saun 
said that more than 3,200 people are 
currently registered to receive the 
warnings.

According to Van Saun, campus 

police are installing a public address 
system that will also be connected to 
police cars. In the event of an emer-
gency, people outside would be able 
to hear the system’s announcements 
— a security measure that few col-
lege campuses have. 

“The idea is to have redundant 
ways of reaching people,” Van Saun 
said. 

Students may also notice the 
introduction of several new blue 
emergency boxes on campus 
throughout Fall Quarter. According 
to UCSD police Lt. David Rose, 
the towers are multifunctional safe-
ty devices that will broadcast the 

public notification system, audible 
within a 1,000-foot radius. Stored 
within each tower is a security cam-
era that will observe the surround-
ing area in the case of an emergency. 
The system can also play a role in 
expanding wireless access points on 
campus.

The two existing towers are 
currently located on Library Walk 
and at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, but there should be 
10 additional boxes installed at a 
later date, Rose said.

Environmental Health and 
Services Director Steve Benedict 
said that since the Virginia Tech 
incident, UCSD has made extra 
efforts to increase the overall safety 
of campus.

In addition, there will be an on-
campus drill on Oct. 16, during 
which members of the San Diego 
S.W.A.T. unit will play assigned roles 
in a simulation of a school shooting 
that mimics the one that took place 
at Virginia Tech.

Volunteers will participate in 
assigned roles as both the shoot-
er and victims, while responders, 
including hospital, fire and police 
personnel, will also participate in 
their respective roles. 

Mock victims will be sent to 
UCSD Thornton Hospital as part of 
the drill, although in a real emer-
gency the more severe victims would 
probably go to Scripps Memorial 
Hospital La Jolla. All participants 
will have their own personal scripts 
to follow, but do not know how oth-
ers will respond. 

The focus of the drill is to give 
emergency personnel on campus as 
well as San Diego city police an 
opportunity to train their tactical 
response abilities in the case of a 
crisis, as well as practice how they 
would deal with the media in such 
an event, Van Saun said.

He denied speculation that the 
Virginia Tech incident was the only 
factor motivating the changes, how-
ever.

“The reason is not because some-
thing happened at Virginia Tech and 
we think it will happen here,” he 
said. “It’s to practice capabilities.”

However, since this simulation 
will occur in a controlled environ-
ment, students on campus that day 
will likely not notice any activity out 
of the ordinary, except for perhaps 
an increase in the usual amount of 
police vehicles, Rose said.

“Our big concern is to make sure 
it’s not just a show,” Van Saun said. 
“We want to make sure someone has 
learned something.”

are accompanied by the division in 
individual school prices — a step 
that generated worry that the contrast 
between graduate school fees will 
eventually lead to a rift between the 
UC campuses. Several regents also 
stressed that the fee increase could 
imply that the institution does not 
need state funding — signaling a 
transition toward privatization. 

“Don’t put it on the back of stu-
dents; don’t send the message to 
the people we seek to serve [that] 
a $40,000 education is affordable,” 
Regent Eddie Island said. “We’ve gone 
too far down this road of seeking help 
from students [and] that’s the wrong 
standard.” 

The regents are requiring that a 
minimum of 33 percent of total revenue 
from the fee increases be allocated to 
financial aid, in order to lessen startling 
cost inflation. In addition, the Loan 
Repayment Assistance Plan offered 
with the law programs gives loan pay-
ment assistance to students who pursue 
low-paying public service jobs. 

“One of the things the schools plan 
to do is be very proactive in providing 
financial aid information to students 
to soften that sticker shock,” Vazquez 
said. “In addition, the school will 
report every year to the regents on any 

change to the demographic composi-
tion of the classes — if the fees have 
in any way affected the demographic 
composition of enrollment.”

However, various regents voiced 
concerns about detrimental effects 
that the surge in graduate school 

prices would cause — such as an 
increasingly limited access to afford-
able graduate education through the 
institution, the lasting debt that stu-
dents may burden themselves with 
long after their programs are com-
pleted and the overall reputation of 
the institution. 

“We ought to evaluate these fees on 
the basis of whether or not they serve 
the land-grant mission and whether 
that there is a societal good we seek to 
serve above all else,” Island said. “Are 
we harming or helping the institution 
we all love?”

Last year, Superior Court Judge 
James Warren ordered the university 
to reimburse over $33.8 million to 
40,000 students in Kashmiri v. Regents 
— a lawsuit stating that the institu-
tion violated its tuition contract with 
professional students enrolled before 
2003 by illegally raising their fees. The 
university is currently appealing the 
court’s ruling.

A.S. enterprise. 
“Originally we thought that a 

partnership with the school could 
be formed,” Associate Vice President 
of Enterprise Operations Chelsea 
Maxwell said in an e-mail. “However, 
after several conversations between 
the A.S., Grove employees and the 
Rady School of Management, it 
became clear that the Grove would 
need more stable and permanent 
management if it were to survive.”

The decision to hire an outside 
manager does nothing to alleviate the 
Grove’s climbing debt — a problem 
exacerbated Spring Quarter of last 
year, when origi-
nal owner Ron 
Carlson liquidat-
ed his 50-percent 
ownership of the 
coffee shop’s con-
tract, leaving the 
A.S. enterprise 
with a staggering 
$48,000 debt.

Now, Grove 
employees are 
skeptical of the 
council’s agree-
ment to hire a 
full-time manager, an option con-
siderably more expensive than the 
former managerial system of hiring 
UCSD students. 

“A.S. will bear the burden of 
financially supporting this individ-
ual, as the Grove is an ‘A.S. enter-
prise,’” John Muir College alumnus 
and former Grove employee Jason 
Grishkoff said in an e-mail. “In addi-
tion to the debt already incurred, 
A.S. has to foot relocation costs and 
a full-time salary for this individual. 
We had a completely free resource 
at our disposal with our relationship 
with the Rady School.”

Regardless of the skepticism, 

the council remains adamant about 
implementing a new method of man-
agement, and has been thorough in 
selecting a manager that it hopes will 
uphold the socially conscious ideals 
the Grove strives toward.

“Over the summer a search com-
mittee was formed, interviews were 
held and a full-time manager was 
chosen for the Grove,” Maxwell said.

Although students will no longer 
have the same access to hands-on 
practice in small-business manage-
ment, Grove employees are largely 
optimistic about the strength of the 
shop’s staying power.

“I’m sure [the new manager] is a 
fully competent 
individual, so I 
can only hope 
that (s)he keeps 
the vibes of the 
Grove alive, 
serving socially 
and environ-
mentally con-
scious products 
and establishing 
the atmosphere 
that makes the 
Grove what it’s 
so loved for,” 

Grishkoff said.
But the disappointment surround-

ing failed relations with the Rady 
School of Management is palpable 
when broached to Grove employees.

“We met several times with A.S. 
and discussed very seriously about 
the potential partnership with Rady,” 
Grishkoff said. “Rady never rejected 
the idea. They received us very posi-
tively and working together, we came 
up with a lot of good ideas. It was 
an A.S. decision to terminate the 
relationship.”

Drake told him the appointment was 
being withdrawn because he had 
proven to be “too politically contro-
versial.”

Drake said that he had lost faith 
in the law professor partly because 
of Chemerinsky’s recent opinion 
articles in the Los Angeles Times 
that criticized former U.S. Attorney 
General Alberto R. Gonzales’ 
political platform, according to an 
Associated Press report.

Chemerinsky responded in a 
Sept. 14 op-ed in the Times, claim-
ing that his opinion articles on 
Gonzalez were written before he 
agreed to sign the contract, and that 
Drake had simply given in to con-
servative pressure.

Drake denied the allegations, say-
ing in an op-ed that his decision was 
“absolutely not based on Professor 
Chemerinsky’s place on the politi-
cal spectrum, which is, in fact, quite 
similar to my own.”

Since then, Drake has rehired 
Chemerinsky and publicly apologized 
for withdrawing the offer.

“I have learned a very painful 
lesson this week,” he said at the emer-
gency meeting of the UC system’s 
Academic Senate. “I made a series of 
difficult decisions without consulting 
senior faculty early enough or often 
enough.”

However, Chemerinsky said he 
was optimistic that the pair’s differ-
ences would not adversely affect the 
law school’s future. 

“I am convinced that we worked 
through our disagreements and that 
we will together build a great institu-
tion,” he said.

According to UC Irvine’s Director 
of Media Relations Cathy Lawhon, 
Drake decided to rehire Chemerinsky 
because they had “met in person, 
resolved their differences and clari-

fied any misunderstandings.”
Though his political view-

points were called into question, 
Chemerinsky said he will “continue 
to express [his] views on issues relat-
ed to the legal system” after accepting 
the position for a second time, and 
that he would continue to be mindful 
of his responsibilities as dean.

While the controversy placed 
the Bren School of Law in a poten-
tially hazardous public spotlight, 
Chemerinsky and Drake said they do 
not feel it has damaged the school’s 
reputation.

“A key problem with a new school 
is getting it known, and we have 
the most publicized new law school 
in history,” Chemerinsky said. “We 
will hire terrific faculty and create a 
great program, and that will be our 
publicity.” 

Lawhon said she agreed with 
Chemerinsky. 

“Chancellor Drake and the rest of 
UCI are very excited to have such a 
high-profile, respected and popular 
dean coming in for our law school,” 
she said.

Investigations into Drake’s deci-
sion are not complete, however, as 
the UC Irvine Academic Senate has 
instructed a committee to analyze 
and report on Drake’s decision by 
mid-December.

Chemerinky said he envisions 
the school as an institution that 
will emphasize the interdisciplinary 
nature of law and experiential learn-
ing. 

“Medical students see patients and 
even treat them,” he said. “Too many 
law students graduate without ever 
having a client.”

The school is expected to admit its 
first class in the fall of 2009.

Academic Senate Plans to 
Investigate Drake’s Decision

tem, out of $4 billion that the University 
of California had in total revenue from 
contracts and grants awarded in fiscal 
year 2006 alone. UCSD currently has 
four active projects funded by Philip 
Morris USA — totaling $1.5 million 
— according to Vice Chancellor for 
Research Arthur B. Ellis.

“Because we have such a small 
number of research projects in this 
area, we do not expect to see any real 
impact as a result of these new guide-
lines,” Ellis said.

Former San Diego Division 
Academic Senate Chair Henry C. 
Powell, who represented UCSD at the 
May Academic Senate meeting, agreed.

“Relative to the size of UCSD’s 
research grant portfolio, this is quite 
small,” Powell said in an e-mail. “So 
the fight was about a principle, namely 
that a scientist should be able to apply 
for research funds without restric-
tions, unless such restrictions are put 
there by law. But all scientists in the 
UC system are accountable for the 
integrity of their scholarly work; that 
practice applies to all funding, private 
and public.”

Michael Karin, a researcher at the 
UCSD School of Medicine, began a 
project in June that received $43,200 
from Philip Morris.

“Our work is focused on the patho-
genic roles of cigarette smoke,” Karin 

said in an e-mail. “Under no circum-
stance [does] it provide tobacco [com-
panies] a way to claim that smoking is 
not a bad thing for health. … We need 
money for research and UC does not 
provide us with any funds. So it is up to 
us the researchers to raise the funds.”

Once a scientific peer review com-
mittee is assembled, new and renewed 
grants awarded by Philip Morris 
and other tobacco companies will 
be scrutinized. 
C h a n c e l l o r 
Marye Anne Fox 
will make the 
final decision.

“Chancellor 
Fox is a very 
strong advocate 
of academic 
freedom who 
has followed this 
issue closely and 
understands its 
importance in 
the broader con-
text,” Powell said. 
“I have the highest confidence in her 
judgment.”

However, UCLA epidemiologist 
James Enstrom said he is still con-
cerned. His research project, which 
challenges prior research that links 
tobacco smoke to disease, has been 
hotly contested by UC San Francisco 
cardiology professor Stanton Glantz. 

The issue spurred the discussion of 
a possible ban, though Enstrom was 
cleared by UCLA for any wrongdoing. 

“There’s going to be a chilling effect 
on the ability to do research,” Enstrom 
said. “We’ll have to see how it evolves 
over time. It’s good, but it’s still not the 
way the faculty wanted it. If the fund-
ing dries up, then they won by intimi-
dation. The real test is going to be 
whether this really kills off the research 

in the coming years. 
That will be trou-
bling.”

Powell agreed, 
citing that scholars 
are in the business 
of providing care-
ful research and the 
public needs reli-
able information.

“What this 
controversy has 
underlined is that 
research into the 
harmful effects 
of environmental 

tobacco smoke is less conclusive than 
generally supposed,” Powell said. “In 
my view, what is badly needed, I think, 
is more  — not less — research.”

Up until now, most research pro-
posals undergo scientific review if, for 
example, animal testing or a poten-
tial conflict of interest is involved. 
However, restriction of funding sourc-

es for research is unprecedented in 
the UC system. Therefore, restrictions 
based on moral and reputational issues 
has been controversial.

“People are trying to assign 
validity according to a source of 
funding, not what [a researcher] 
actually does,” Enstrom said.

Glantz, on the other hand, said 
he views the issue as one discourag-
ing groups with agendas promoting 
unhealthy behavior from seeking 
research to legitimize their goals.

While one year of debate and 
voting by both the Academic Senate 
and the UC Board of Regents has 
resulted in the resolution, there is 
no guarantee that the issue — which 
goes back to 2004 — will remain 
resolved.

“I cannot be certain that this 
will not resurface, but I think that a 
compromise that brings together UC 
Regents and faculty will restore sta-
bility to the situation,” Powell said.

On May 17, Stanford University 
similarly rejected a ban on tobac-
co-company funding by a 21-10 
vote. Harvard University, Johns 
Hopkins University, the University 
of Washington and approximately 11 
other institutions across the nation 
currently have such bans in place.

Vote on the new question at www.ucsdguardian.org.

It was just last week that I lamented  the fact I was making the transition. You know, that 
fateful move from 21 — yes, that 
Jagermeister-drenched legal mile-
stone — to “other.” Er, older. I mean, 
well, you know what I mean.

Rewind a year back to my 21st 
birthday. Even though I had some 
grand notion buried in the back of 
my head that I would be having some 
huge party with gorgeous floozies and 
free-flowing whiskey sours, I actually 
ity I spent it charging a 12-pack of 
Corona with my roommate, Richard. 
It was that night that I managed to 
convince myself I didn’t necessarily 
need to celebrate my birthday with need to celebrate my birthday with need
a party in order to have an awesome 
time.

So I couldn’t explain why, all of a 
sudden, I started to feel a little appre-
hensive about — don’t laugh now 
— turning 22. Maybe it was because 
it reminded me that I was a senior 
non-premed biology major with no 
post-college plans. Or maybe it was 
because I didn’t have any actual rea-
son to celebrate; at least on my 21st 
birthday I could fantasize, but this 
time I couldn’t even do that.

But that all changed when I finally 
sat down to think about the situation. 
Twenty-one is definitely the famed 
birthday of lore, when all it takes is 
the second hand to click midnight, 
and suddenly you’re mature enough 
to drink a handle of Captain Morgan. 
Twenty-two, however, is nothing. It 
has no associated alcoholic coming-
of-age factors, and thus, by social 
definition, should suck. Even me, the 
guy who said he didn’t need a party, 
was kind of depressed about the situ-
ation.

So I decided to change my ways 
after the clouds in my brain parted 
to reveal a golden revelation: There 
are two twos in 22. I wasn’t going to 
have another opportunity like this for 
11 more years, and damn it, I wasn’t 
going to let this go without a fight.

After  hastily creating the event 
on Facebook.com, I was pleasantly 
surprised to see almost 70 confirmed 
guests within two days. At the party, 
we danced, we drank (and drank), 
we were loud and some of us even 
jumped into the pool half-naked. 
Even though the keg ran out kind of 
early (please don’t give me a nega-
tive review Koala people, because I 
know you were there and sorry, but 
I’m not rich and the early bird gets 
the booze), I had the hands-down 
best birthday of my life.

And why stop at 22? All you 23-
year-old sixth years should join in 
the fun as well. After all, the next 
time you’ll self-identify as a prime 
number won’t be for another six 
years. So seize your chance — now.

I guess in the grand scheme of 
things, my point is that if your 21st 
birthday wasn’t some huge bash, get 
over it and make each subsequent 
birthday the shit in its own right. 
Besides, we all drank before we were 
21, so it’s not even that big of a deal 
to anyone, save the cops and maybe 
your mom. Twenty-two is the new 
21, and 23 is the new 22.

So party on.

S
TUDENT LIFE — Penny Rue was not 
looking for a new job, but one found 
her. She was recruited from her post at  
University of Virginia to replace former 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 

W. Watson, who had just finished a decades-long 
tenure. She inherits the office most directly linked 
to students — the department oversees admissions, 
athletics and most all facets of student life.

Watson grappled with a long-standing uni-
versity problem, one that was laid out by the 
Undergraduate Student Experience and Satisfaction 
report: UCSD lacks a strong, unified community.

Recruiters pegged Rue as the cure for what has 
become UCSD’s defining problem. The university, 
and its colleges, form an expansive entity that finds 
difficulty in clearly uniting its parts. Separation of 
community is built into the school’s administrative 
hierarchy and physical layout. The six colleges find 
it difficult to establish their own communities and 
identities, as students tend to finish their general edu-
cation requirements and move off campus. Several 
attempts by the colleges (cross-college events, more 
A.S. Council positions with university-wide focus) 
have fallen short of creating community ties. Even 
Library Walk, the center of campus, is designed as a 
passageway — not a hang out — which impedes the 
formation of community.

Rue believes that communities are built on one-
on-one interactions: “It’s all about creating rela-
tionships,” Rue said. She said that UCSD is on the 
rise, ready to become one of the top contributors 
to many fields of knowledge, but acknowledged 
the university’s most immediate enigma: an ailing 
community spirit.

The new vice chancellor’s introduction to 

UCSD was a busy one: she walked past the tribal 
masks and UCSD literature in the lobby of the 
her office complex to meet for an interview. She 
had endured back-to-back interviews the entire 
day, and her upcoming schedule will find no 
relief: appointments fill her work days until late 
October. Still, her personable side managed to 
shine: “Happy birthday,” Rue said to one of her 
employees as she escorted me to her office, which 
has views of both the students and sagging  tree 
branches around Library Walk. 

In her previous position, Rue established a 
multicultural center and expanded the Greek 
program. Her colleagues knew her as approach-
able and professional, especially toward students. 
She praised her staff for being ambitious and 
focused on the students’ well being. During her 
career in Virginia, she commissioned a report 
similar to the U.S.E.S. report, which she used 
to measure the community’s needs and respond 
accordingly. 

The vice chancellor of student affairs at 

UCSD, however, is a much larger position, cov-
ering over 27 programs. UCSD also has twice 
the undergraduate enrollment of the University 
of Virginia. Various directors and assistant vice 
chancellors report directly to Rue and the student 
body is separated from her by at least two levels 
of bureaucracy. Still, she plans to communicate 
directly with students — the foundation of her 
policies and goals. 

“I am in the business to form relationships,” 
Rue said. During Welcome Week, she spent much 
of her time walking all over the school meeting 
students. She even served up some ice cream.

Rue has invited staff throughout the student 
affairs department to schedule time to talk with 
her directly. She hopes that these high-level 
conversations themselves will eventually reach 
students, and spark a movement where all stu-
dents will find and strengthen, or create, their 
own communities. It’s a recycled idea that may 
have worked for Virginia, but is too ambitious 
for UCSD. Her expertise in community-building 
now encounters its biggest opponent: this univer-
sity’s vast network of student services. In addition, 
UCSD’s larger population will stunt the impact of 
her trickle-down technique with sheer numbers. 

Though Rue’s moxie is admirable and her 
expertise is suitable for the campus’ ails, she fails 
to recognize the breadth and depth of our uni-
versity. Our problem has become woven into our 
development, something that has existed since 
the creation of UCSD. Attempting to build a com-
munity by empowering the student alone is naive, 
mainly because she’s in a hostile environment; 
UCSD has been built with the aim of stifling 
community, not breeding it.

is naive, but appreciated.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— When UC Irvine announced the 
formation of its new law school, the 
public confidently supported school 
officials, believing the endeavor 
would earn the university additional 
prestige. 

No one, however, expected the 
mockery that the law school would 
become. 

It started only a few months 
ago, when UC Irvine Chancellor  
Michael V. Drake announced his 
decision to appoint the respected 
Duke Law School professor Erwin 
Chemerinsky as dean of the school’s 
newest undertaking. 

Students and faculty were 
overjoyed; here was a man who 
had argued cases before the U.S. 
Supreme Court, who testified before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
who even represented CIA opera-
tive Valerie Plame Wilson — and he 
would be heading their law school. 
They couldn’t have been luckier.

It was no surprise, then, that 
news of Drake’s reckless decision 
sparked a public outcry. Faculty and 
staff quickly united not only in sup-
port of Chemerinsky, but also to 
question Drake’s ability to effec-
tively lead their school.

By pulling the plug on 
Chemerinsky’s UC career, Drake had 
stonewalled the progress needed to 
meet the law school’s goal of open-
ing in 2009 and turned the school
into the laughingstock of the UC 

system. According to faculty, these 
antics have threatened the future of 
the law school.

“I personally do not see how 
[Drake] can be effective going for-
ward given the opposition across 
campus to what he did,” UC 
Irvine business professor Richard 
McKenzie told the Los Angeles Times 
on Sept. 18. “I’ve never seen the fac-
ulty so unified.”

In the face of mounting opposi-
tion, and with the fear of losing his 
job if he neglected to act, Drake 
hastily began efforts to re-court 
the esteemed professor. Less than 
a week after being denied his posi-
tion, Chemerinsky agreed to climb 
back on board. In terms of repairing 
the public damage, however, Drake 
was too little too late. 

Administrative confidence had 
evaporated and word was rapid-
ly spreading that Drake’s efforts 
were not based on concern over 
Chemerinksky’s skills but rather 
an attempt to appease conserva-
tives who disliked the professor’s 
liberal political stance. The situation 
left old supporters questioning the 
stability of his leadership and his 
commitment to free speech. Even 
his apologies at UC Irvine’s Sept. 20 
Academic Senate meeting could not 
compensate for the baffling inci-
dent; the damage was irreparable.

If anything is to be gained from 
the embarrassing episode, however, 
it should be treated as a learning tool 
for the university — how not to start 
a law school. When UC Irvine offi-
cials meet again on Dec. 15 to read-
dress the matter of Drake’s future as 
chancellor and the events surround-
ing the hiring, firing and rehiring of 
Chemerinsky, they should honestly 
ask themselves if Drake is the man 
for the job.

His priority to satisfy conser-
vatives, despite a liberal university 

environment, hints at a dismissal 
of school interests. His disregard 
for the importance of free speech at 
the institution indicates that his pri-
orities are not suited for UC Irvine’s 
liberal setting. His disrespect for 
Chemerinsky foreshadows possible 
conflicts between the chancellor 
and dean and Drake’s ignorance of 
campus opinions signals similar dis-
crepancies between the staff and 
administration.

Even if the whole debacle was 
a careless and honest mistake, the 
consequences are too profound 

— and Drake’s ability to lead in 
too much jeopardy — to permit 
a smooth grand opening in two 
years. 

Unless the school wants students 
pointing and laughing instead of 
clamoring for a spot on its 2009 
acceptance list, university officials 
would be wise to act now by urg-
ing Drake to resign as UC Irvine’s 
chancellor.

UC Irvine chancellor 
publicly butts heads over 
dean appointment and 
highlights his inability to 
lead campus.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2007

By Jim Shen
Staff Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — For most col-
lege students, the beginning of the 
school year brings with it the wallet-
draining ordeal of buying textbooks. 

In a move aimed at easing the 
financial burden, the California legis-
lature passed two separate textbook-
pricing bills last week. 

The College Textbook Affordability 
Act and the College Textbook 
Transparency Act are similar in many 
regards, but contain several key dif-
ferences that cause textbook publish-
ers to support the Transparency Act, 
while student organizations such as 
CalPIRG support the Affordability 
Act. Although the Affordability Act 
is the better piece of legislation for 
students because it lays out clearer, less 
malleable guidelines for publishers, it 
too has significant shortcomings.

Unlike the more stringent 
Affordability Act requirements, the 
Transparency Act does not require 
publishers to make lists contain-
ing prices and edition differences 
available online. Instead, they must 
merely “be responsive in a timely 
manner to requests for information 
on textbook cost and content and 
the full range of options.” This vague 

wording leaves much up to interpre-
tation and gives publishers plenty 
of room to play smoke and mirrors, 
whereas requiring the information 
to be on the Internet makes it avail-
able to professors clearly and instan-
taneously.

Another weakness in the 
Transparency Act is that many of its 
provisions, such as listing prices and 
changes on book covers, only go into 
effect in 2010, while the Affordability 
Act would go into effect immediately if 
signed into law. It shouldn’t take pub-
lishers three years to retool their print-
ing presses to publish a price listing on 
the cover of their textbooks, when they 
can create a completely new textbook 
in that amount of time. Nor should 
it take them three years to compile 
a list of differences between editions 
and make them available to the public 
on request. The information certain-
ly exists within the shrink-wrapped 
covers of textbooks themselves and it 
should be simple to compile such a list 
for the public.

The Transparency Act also 
subtly shifts the responsibility for 
expensive textbooks onto campus 
bookstores, requiring them to list 
their retail pricing policies. But the 
price difference between bookstores 
and other retailers is tiny compared 

to the overall prices of textbooks. 
The Amazon.com price for a new 
copy of the 10th edition of Human 
Physiology, a biology textbook by 
Stuart Ira Fox, is $146.88, while 
the UCSD Bookstore sells the same 
book for $156.70. The difference is 
less than 10 percent, and is easily 

explained by the overhead costs of a 
physical store. Looking to reforma-
tion of campus bookstores to lower 
textbook prices is misguided at best, 
and a red herring at worst.

Adding insult to injury, the 
Transparency Act has a section 
aimed at preventing universities and 
professors from accepting bribes. 
According to the bill, universities 
and professors cannot “demand or 

receive anything of value, including 
the … deposit of money, present 
or promised, for adopting specific 
course materials.” On top of the 
already illegal nature of accept-
ing bribes, the bill’s wording lays 
the blame for unethical marketing 
practices completely at the feet of 
schools instead of on the publish-
ing company. The Affordability Act 
has no similar section — the writer 
of that bill was probably aware that 
bribery is already illegal and that 
publishers are responsible for their 
own marketing practices.

Even though the Affordability 
Act lacks many of the faults of the 
Transparency Act, neither will suc-
ceed in truly reducing textbook 
costs. Disclosing prices will not 
compel publishers to lower prices, 
or stop publishing new editions of 
calculus textbooks every five years, 
when the concepts of derivatives and 
integrals have remained the same 
for the past 100. Nor do these bills 
prevent publishers from passing the 
costs of disclosing their prices onto 
consumers. While professors will 
have more information available to 
be able to assign less expensive text-
books, neither piece of legislation 
forces the industry to lower prices 
as a whole. 

Additionally, according to the 
State Public Interest Research 
Group’s report “Ripoff 101” in 
2004, “the average textbook sur-
veyed costs 20 percent more in the 
United States than it does in the 
United Kingdom.” Back in 2004, 
the Massachusetts Public Interest 
Research Group reported that 
the price of Thomson Learning’s 
“Calculus: Early Transcendentals” 
was priced at $125 in the United 
States but only $65 (₤35) in the UK. 

Today, the difference is less but 
still exists, with the U.S. copy selling 
for $180.95 while the British copy 
goes for about $175 (₤85.99). Neither 
the Affordability or Transparency 
Act would make publishers do any-
thing to give California universi-
ties and students textbook prices 
that their international counterparts 
enjoy.

The Transparency Act is heavily 
flawed in its attempt to counter the 
rising costs of textbooks to be con-
sidered a serious piece of legislation 
that would benefit students. 

And while the Affordability 
Act is an honest attempt at forcing 
change, there needs to be further 
legislation aimed at lowering text-
book prices if a significant improve-
ment is to be had.

State Bills Fail to Curtail Ballooning Textbook Costs

“The College Textbook “The College Textbook “Transparency Act has “Transparency Act has “far too many flaws ... to be considered a 
serious piece of 

legislation.”

MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2007MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2007

During Welcome Week, most clubs camped on Library Walk borderline harassed students 
by whipping flyers and ad cards in their 
faces, trying to spark even the slightest 
interest in their organization. Members 
of UCSD’s nascent Rubik’s Cube Club, 
however, simply sat at their modest, 
flyer-less table, aligning the primary 
colors of their respective cubes into 
their proper places, and caught the 
interest of hundreds of students.

 “One awesome moment was when a 
guy walked past our booth on Library 
Walk while talking on his cell, stopped, 
and told his friend that he had to hang 
up, because there was a Rubik’s Cube 
Club,” Thurgood Marshall sophomore 
Alex Muir said in an e-mail.

 Muir is just one of five officers in 
the Rubik’s Cube Club, founded and 
headed by Revelle College sophomore 
Phillip Espinoza. The group of friends 
started the club last April, hoping to 
spread their own enthusiasm of Rubik’s 
cubing by teaching students basic 
methods of how to solve a cube.

 “The Rubik’s Cube Club offers a 
learning environment that is always 

open to 
anyone and 
everyone. The 
entire club encompasses t h e 
thought of sharing our abilities with 
others so that they too can learn and 
teach others. New members become 
students. Students become teachers. 
From then on, it’s their choice of what 
to make of it,” Warren College sopho-
more and Officer Michael Baustista 
said in an e-mail.

 Rubik’s Cube Club meetings work 
like a basic peer tutorial program. The 
sessions might start off with an educa-
tional power-point presentation or a 
guest speaker (according to Bautista, 
one of the fastest solvers in the world 
will be making an appearance at one of 
their meetings) but will almost always 
be bookended by socializing and shar-
ing of tips of how to solve a cube.

 And while solving a Rubik’s Cube 
may seem like an awesome yet daunt-
ing task, according to Muir College 

sophomore and 
Officer Danielle 

Pandika, it really isn’t 
that difficult.

 “It’s simply a matter of pat-
tern recognition,” Pandika said in 

an e-mail. “You assess the pattern pres-
ent on the cube, and execute the appro-
priate algorithm. Repeat until the cube 
is solved. Of course, there are several 
patterns and corresponding moves to 
memorize. So, memorization is pivotal. 
Not being colorblind probably helps 
too.”

After members learn how to solve 
the traditional 3x3 Rubik’s Cubes with 
two hands, they can move on to learn-
ing blindfolded and one-handed meth-
ods and work at solving 4x4s and 
5x5s.

No matter how easy it might be 
to solve a Rubik’s Cube or how com-
plicated and difficult it can become, 
members agree that something about 
solving the puzzle impresses others and 
boosts self-esteem.

“The Rubik’s Cube is supposedly 
this puzzle that only a genius or Will 
Smith can figure out, but here we are 
offering to teach people to solve it 

within seconds. Nothing quite says 
genius like whipping out a cube 
and solving it multiple times on the 
shuttle ride over to UTC,” Pandika 
said. 

Once their members have devel-
oped their skills, the club also hopes 
to compete in several World Cubing 
Association-recognized competi-
tions.

“We hope to host a couple of com-
petitions per school year on campus. 
Hopefully in the future we can have 
cube-offs with other schools. UC 
Irvine, UC Berkeley, and Cal Tech 
all have cube clubs which we could 
compete with,” Thurgood Marshall 
Sophomore and Officer Kevin Wu 
said in an e-mail.

In addition to competitive events, 
the Rubik’s Cube Club is also plan-
ning to host events that are based 
more on socializing than learning. 

“We are planning many events 
that take a break from the learn-
ing part of cubing and focus on the 
socializing aspect. We plan to cube 
at the beach just to have fun. We also

consisting of a student from each of the six colleges, race against 
one another. another. another After the competition between the “mixed” teams, 
each college seperates and performs its own choreographed

WW ith contiguous blocks of apartment buildings covering University City like a checkered blanket, it’s easy 
to feel smothered as you drive its pothole-
laden streets or walk past its lonely bus stops. 
But as I stood 19 stories up an unfinished 
residential tower last week, I was literally and 
figuratively above it all.

The ascent began easy enough; my 
roommate had gone on a run around our 
neighborhood and noticed a gap in the 
green construction fencing surrounding 
the tower’s skeleton. He called me on his 
cell phone and, in a few minutes, we were 
both walking down the street from our cozy 
condominium toward the monolith whose 
shadow postpones our sunrise every morn-
ing. Guarded on its south side by hundreds 
of apartment windows as well as a gigantic 
crane, our newfound entrance was conve-
niently located to the north, where another 
apartment tower was spaced an acceptable 
distance away, where its gaze seemed more 
indifferent than usual to two imminent 
trespassers. As we walked by this building, I 
looked up through one of its wide windows 
and pointed out a father settling into bed 
while his toddler seized the opportunity to 
hop on his stomach. As easily as we could 
peer into the lives the few who still had 
their lights on at that late hour, though, 
none appeared to be concerned with any-
thing or anyone outside in the dark — that’s 
how we snuck into our tower.

At street level in University City, often the 
only things that break the darkness are the 
intermittent street lights. Their monochro-
matic yellow glow is enough to turn even the 
brightest parti-colored garments into muddy 
brown coverings. This usually leads me as a 
photographer to shoot in black and white — 
if I do at all — to avoid the inevitable gloomy 
warmth of a color photo in that situation. 
That night of the ascent, though, I would not 
attempt an image on the ground.

Once inside the first floor of the tower, 
my first thought was that I still lacked the 
proper environment to take pictures. The 
darkness was even richer than on the street, 

and I was suddenly aware of how the ever-
present light pollution surreptitiously low-
ers our standard for pitch black. Though I 
had a flash on my camera, I was not about 
to let my strobe reveal our presence to any 
passersby. The concern was validated as we 
neared the stairwell and saw a door with a 
window, revealing a lit utility room from the 
building to which the tower was being added. 
My curiosity pulled me closer to this door, 
where I was taken aback by a man plod-
ding around just on the other side. This was 
enough to get me quickly onto the stairwell, 
grimacing each time we made the unfinished 
metal steps creak or resonate too loudly as we 
climbed the floors.

Each shell of a floor was identified with 
corresponding number spray-painted on 
the drywall near the stairs. Incandescent 
bulbs strung along in industrial lamps lit 
it all. The glow was warm and we were 
surprised by the brightness inside the 
building’s dark expanse. It was already an 
improvement over the streetlights. I tried 
taking a few shots of my roommate and we 
ventured upward.

We hit the end of the stairs at the 19th 
floor and were greeted by a stiff breeze 
that would have made us shiver had we 
not been heated internally by the climb. 
The breeze was a fresh release from the 
dead, ground-level air that is stifled by the 
structures found on all sides. The surpris-
ing wind was the first indication that we 
were free from the confines of University 
City and on our very own plane. We peered 
around the back of the stairwell to confirm 
that this floor had no walls, and that in fact

there was nothing between me and 
the towering Mormon Temple a 
couple miles away.

The view was spectacular. I could 
see pools, cars, a baseball field I 
didn’t know existed — and I think 
I even spotted Geisel Library. And 
that ridiculous Mormon Temple 
that seems like it was ripped from 
a Super Mario Bros. game no longer 
made me roll my eyes. Instead its 
white light inspired me to pick up 
my camera. Its beacon shone above 
the various bricks of apartments and 
condos as if to say, “I’m no more 
ridiculous than those boxes you live 
in.” The quality of the neighborhood 
blocks was also different. The dots 
of yellow sodium vapor and green 
fluorescent bulbs of so many dwell-
ings combined to outline shapes 
— squares mostly. I was above the 
patchwork now, and could see it 
spread out gently over the hills as if 
for a picnic in front of Mario’s castle. 
And they no longer overpowered 
the moonlight; in the dead of night 
I could shoot photos with a creamy 
natural palette.

For over an hour my roommate 
and I explored the open space of 
the 19th floor. I had no tripod, so 
getting the long exposures I want-
ed was tricky. I rested my cam-
era on anything I could find, from 
the weak wooden railing keeping 
us from being blown off the side, 
to a cooler still rattling with ice 
from the previous day. We even 
climbed a ladder to reach the very 
top roof of the place, nimbly shuf-
fling along corrugated metal while 
I used my camera’s flash to my 
heart’s content. No one would see 
us; we were all alone on top of the 
world. In University City, you can 
travel a mile in any direction and see 
nothing but residential complexes 
so nondescript that the only way 
to tell them apart is by their com-
pletely arbitrary names like Costa 
Verde and The Venetian. It came as 
much relief to learn I could travel a 
much shorter distance upward and 
see revealed a higher truth to this 
neighborhood that is surprisingly 
beautiful.

Actor’s Body

From Cleopatra to Cleopatra to Cleopatra Boogie 
Nights, the period ﬁ lm is both 
a claim to historical record 
and a mirror of the social 
environment in which the 
movie was made—nowhere 
are these inﬂ uences more 
at play than in the realm of 
costume design.  We take an 
in-depth look at the costumed 
performer in 10 great ﬁ lms to 
explore the design’s historical, 
psychological and narrative 
implications.  Students will 
survey the history of dress 
while examining the practical 
and artistic considerations 
of design for the big screen.

plan to have a hang out night where 
we have a primary color theme. It 
will be more laid back than some of 
our meetings and we will just hang 
out, cube and talk,” Espinoza said.

While being part of the Rubik’s 
Cube Club may expand a student’s 
social horizons and earn them some 
intellectual street-cred, it can also 
reward them at unexpected times.

“Though cubers don’t get paid 
any money for winning competi-
tions, there are those rare occasions 
that cubing pays off. For example, 
the other day, I did a cubing dem-
onstration for the people at Golden 

Spoon and they gave me a free 
yogurt. All those hours I spent prac-
ticing finally paid off when I got that 
free yogurt,” Espinoza said.

While it might seem strange for 
members to carry their cubes with 
them at all times — yogurt runs 
included — this type of behavior 
is typical for a Rubik’s Cube Club 
member.

“While its not our intent to pro-
mote such zeal, it seems to inevita-
bly happen. Unlike many hobbies, 
like video games or trinket-collect-
ing, you can work on the Rubik’s 
cube virtually anywhere,” Pandika 
said.

Overall, the Rubik’s Cube Club 
is happy to represent a more unique 
niche of UCSD students, and isn’t 
afraid to flaunt its brainy abilities.

“We’re one of the few clubs 
that are proud to be slightly geeky, 
although that doesn’t necessar-
ily mean that our members are. We 
fuse an intellectual pursuit with pop 
culture, and for some, a way of life,” 
Muir said.

with two consecutive blocks. 
The Lions fought back at the end 

of the quarter, lobbing another goal 
over Rule with less than a minute left 
in the half to put UCSD in a 4-3 hole. 
In the last seconds of the first half, 
Roberts was ejected for the game 
while defending a last-second Lions 
attempt at the goal. The ejection 
would prove costly for the Tritons in 
the second half of the game.

“We played well enough in the 
first half to stay in the ball game,” 
Harper said. “It hurt us that Roberts 
got majored at the end of the first 
half. That was a bummer for us in 
the second half.”

The second half was an offen-
sive nightmare for the Tritons. 
Garcia scored in the two-meter off 
of a dry pass from junior driver 
Chance Vermilyea to cut Loyola 
Marymount’s lead to 5-4. However, 
the Lions again strongly ended the 
quarter with two goals. They also 
held the Tritons scoreless, extending 
their lead to 7-4.

The Tritons’ struggles continued 
in the fourth quarter as they failed to 

score in the final period of the game. 
The Lions then notched two more 
goals, making the final score 9-4.

“It was a bad game for us,” senior 
two-meter Simon Schafer said. 
“It was a step back for the team. 
Nothing came together and we were 
playing nervous.” 

The Tritons’ young team played 
in front of a home crowd of over 
1,500, their first large home crowd 
of the year. 

“The team just didn’t handle 
the crowd very well,” Harper said. 
“They’re a young team and I antici-
pate a different story in our next 
home game.” 

The Tritons’ next games come at 
home against No. 8 UC Santa Barbara 
on Oct. 5 and No. 7 Long Beach State 
at home on Oct. 6. UCSD lost close 
games to both of the ranked teams 
earlier in the season and hopes to 
have more success the second time 
around. 

“We have to produce on offense,” 
Schafer said. “Our defense has come 
a long way from the beginning of the 
season, but we need to be firing on 
all cylinders and put the ball away.”

opposite Amber Ries stuffed the 
Lumberjack attack for a 22-18 lead 
and forced a Lumberjack timeout.

Humboldt State wouldn’t go qui-
etly though, chipping away at the 
Triton lead to close the gap to only 
one. 

That’s when Bailey took over.
With senior outside hitter Casey 

Wilson on the service line, Bailey 
tallied three kills to supplement 
Wilson’s ace and give UCSD the 
lead 26-21. Bailey would slam down 
number 10 and 11 en route to the 
30-23 game two win.

“We got really aggressive with our 
serve in that second game,” Black 
said. “I really stressed that the setters 
needed to connect with the hitters 
and that happened toward the end of 
game two.”

Following the trend from the first 
two games, neither team solidified 
any kind of serious advantage. Tied 
8-8, the Tritons pulled away on a pair 
of Lumberjack errors and a Schmidt 
kill. Schmidt followed with an ace, 
giving the Tritons a 14-10 lead. 

Battling back to a one-point 
deficit, Humboldt State was mysti-
fied as UCSD went on a four-point 
run to regain the edge 18-13. Each 
Lumberjack attempt for a comeback 
was thwarted by the Triton defense 
as UCSD rolled to a 30-21 victory. 

“I was really pleased with the 
fact that we had no big fluctuations 
tonight,” Black said. “We stopped 
[Humboldt State’s] runs and played 
really steady.”

With the latest win under their 
belt, the Tritons will embark on 
a three-game road trip to try and 
cement their spot among the best 
of the best in the CCAA. UCSD 
matches up at Cal State Monterey 
Bay on Oct. 5 and at Sonoma State 
Oct. 6 next week before taking on 
No. 16 Cal State Los Angeles Oct. 10. 
Games are set for a 7 p.m. serve.

UCSD Looks to Stay Above .500 in CCAA Play
▶ VOLLEYBALL, from page 24

SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN
Freshman middle blocker Kaitlin Potter and the Tritons have not dropped a game in two straight matches.

“We started our season over,” 
Levy said. “If we win this game, who 
knows what’s going to happen this 
season? The coach gave us a little 
speech and we went out there and 
won. It’s a totally different game when 
you score first. You just have to play 
at the same level and we were able to 
hold them off.”

Following its major upset over 
Seattle Pacific, the team went on to 
face No. 13 Seattle 
University on 
Friday, but fell 0-
2. After their 1-1 
road trip to the 
Northwest, the 
Tritons overall 
record dropped 
to 2-7-1. The 
Tritons’ scoring 
woes continued, 
as they man-
aged to score 
only one goal 
in two games. 
Although the 
Tritons outshot 
Seattle Pacific 
5-3, Seattle University overwhelmed 
UCSD by notching 21 shots to 
UCSD’s seven. 

Holohan was not too worried 
about the lack of shots during the 
games. 

“I thought we did very well,” he 
said. “We had the lion’s share of goals 
against Seattle Pacific and I don’t feel 
as if we were outshot as badly as the 
stats say.”

Levy agreed, adding that the lack 
of experience has played a major role 
in the lack of offense.

“We have been playing well this 
season,” he said. “It’s just not scor-
ing. We have a lot of opportunities 
and never really converted. But on 

Wednesday we did and finally scored 
first. It’s probably lack of experience 
with 14 new guys and nine fresh-
men, and lots of them are starting 
and getting a lot of playing time. We 
just started recently doing goal drills 
in practice and it’s showing in the 
games.”

If the last three games were any 
indication, the Tritons seem to have 
gotten their act together and are 
looking forward to making a run 

back into confer-
ence contention.

“The last three 
games, the errors 
have been less,” 
Holohan said. 
“The Cal State Los 
Angeles game, we 
should have gotten 
some thing out of 
it; at least a tie in 
double overtime. 
The rest of our 
games are confer-
ence matches and 
because we have 
been close in lots 
of games hopefully 

we can turn some games in our favor 
if we can eradicate mistakes from our 
young players, our freshmen who are 
still learning.”

HOT CORNER

MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2007

By Joo Yoon
Staff Writer

The UCSD men’s soccer team 
lost head coach Derek Armstrong 
earlier last week when he retired 
suddenly in the middle of his 26th 
season with the program. He leaves 
after taking the helm in 1982, when 
he began to turn the consistently 
mediocre team into a strong con-
tender, both in Division III and 
Division II competition.

During his tenure, Armstrong 
coached over 500 games, leading 
the Tritons to 15 NCAA Division III 
tournaments as well as five appear-
ances in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association tournament 
at the Division II level. Perhaps 
Armstrong’s greatest accomplish-
ments came in 1988, 1991 and 1993 
when the Tritons were crowned  
NCAA National Champions.

Armstrong said his health was 
the main reason he retired this sea-
son and that the team’s early season 
struggles had nothing to do with his 
decision.

“The only reason is my knees,” 
Armstrong said. “My knees needed 
immediate surgery and I had a pre-
op [Sept. 27] and the right knee will 
have surgery [Sept. 29].”

Armstrong’s sudden retirement 
was a shock to players and coach-
ing staff.

“It was a surprise,” interim head 
coach Paul Holohan said.

The day following Armstrong’s 
sudden retirement, the Tritons still 

rallied around Holohan to pull off 
a major upset over No. 6 Seattle 
Pacific, 1-0. Newcomer junior for-
ward Jason Le, who has made a 
clear impact since returning from 
an injury, scored the winning goal 
in the early minutes of the first half. 
It was his fourth goal in his past 
three matches.

Holohan acknowledged the big 
boost Le has given the team ever 
since his return but emphasized that 
the whole team has been playing 
better.

“There’s no doubt he’s a big play-
er for us,” he said. “But we are going 
to work harder and rally around 
each other.”

Sophomore goalkeeper Joshua 
Vasquez filled in for regular start-
er junior Peter Akman and posted 
three saves to get the Tritons’ second 
shutout of the year. Akman did not 
play because he received a red card 
during against Cal State Los Angeles 
on Sept. 23.

Holohan praised the team’s effort 
in his first game and win as interim 
head coach.

“Being my first game after 
[Armstrong] left, we just tried to get 
very organized,” Holohan said. “The 
boys played a hell of a game.”

Going into the game, senior 
captain Josh Levy said the players 
decided to start fresh with this game 
and scoring the first goal helped.

At the end of last week’s victory 
over Cal Poly Pomona, Head Coach 
Tom Black told the UCSD women’s 
volleyball team that the win could 
be used as the starting point for the 
entire season.

After a 30-17, 30-23, 30-21 thrash-
ing of Humboldt State Sept. 29, it 
was apparent the team had taken the 
words as a challenge. 

“We really loved what he said,” 
junior captain and outside hit-
ter Rebecca Bailey said. “It gave us 
momentum and taught us that we 
shouldn’t focus on what’s happened 
but look ahead at what we can still 
control.”

The Tritons looked impressive 
in front of the large home crowd at 
the RIMAC Arena, where they hit 
the 10-win mark and moved to 4-3 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association.

“The crowd gives us an adrena-
line rush,” Bailey said. “We need 
them hopefully as much as they 
want to see us.”

In game one against the 
Lumberjack squad, the Tritons 
blazed out to a 19-10 lead on Bailey’s 
fifth kill of the night. The lead was 
stretched to 23-14 on back-to-back 
aces by Bailey.

Black and the team worked dili-
gently over the past week to improve 
their attacking, and the focus paid 
off Saturday night.

“We’ve worked really hard on 
our out-of-system swinging and 
middles,” Black said. “Tonight we 
were very steady and we stopped 

the bleeding when Humboldt got 
on runs.”

Game two was riddled with 
errors from both sides as the Tritons 
and Lumberjacks traded points in 
the early stages. UCSD took a quick 
4-2 advantage on sophomore setter 
Elaine Chen’s ace. The lead grew to 
8-5 after another UCSD kill.

The Lumberjacks responded with 
two kills and a Triton hitting error to 
tie it up. Sophomore middle blocker 

Sylvia Schmidt then landed her third 
kill on the night to return the lead to 
UCSD 11-10. 

UCSD finally found breathing 
room late in the game, as senior

The No. 12 UCSD men’s water 
polo team bounced back from a 
9-4 loss to Loyola Marymount 
University with convincing wins of 8-
5 against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
Colleges and 17-7 over Pomona-
Pitzer Colleges — two teams that 
the Tritons had easily beaten earlier  
this season.

The Tritons played their best in 
the Sept. 29 match against Pomona-
Pitzer Colleges with both offense 
and defense excelling for the first 
time in several games. Sophomore 
two-meter defender Steven Donohoe 
scored five goals and sophomore 
two-meter Daniel Garcia added four 
as UCSD continued its domination 
over Pomona-Pitzer.

“We had two guys [Donohoe 
and Garcia] scoring that we expect 
to score in any game,” head coach 
Denny Harper said. “We played 
much more like ourselves.” Garcia 
and Donohoe are currently the 
Tritons’ first and third leading scor-
ers, respectively.

However, the Tritons did not play 
as well against Claremont, but they 
still overwhelmed the Stags to pick 

up the victory.
“We were a little sluggish in the 

game,” Harper said. “It was tough 
coming back from the loss to [Loyola 
Marymount].” 

While their defense held up well, 
with freshman goalkeeper Adam 
Rule holding Claremont to only five 
goals, the Tritons’ offensive strug-
gles from their game against Loyola 
Marymount continued. UCSD was 
only two for 11 on its six-on-five 
opportunities, playing poorly even 
when it had a one-man advantage. 

The drought on offensive didn’t sink 
the team, as the defense was able to 
hold off Claremont for the victory.  

A poor second-half showing ulti-
mately cost the Tritons a win in a 
9-4 loss against Loyola Marymount 
University in front of a packed home 
crowd. Although UCSD never led 
the Lions, it stayed in the game for 
the entire first half. 

The Lions scored the first goal 
less than one minute into the con-
test, forcing the Tritons to play from 
behind from the beginning. Garcia 

answered back with a goal on the 
Tritons’ transition offense, tying the 
game at 1-1.

However, Loyola Marymount 
finished the last two minutes of the 
first quarter on a high note, con-
verting on a six-on-five opportunity 
and lobbing a shot over Rule for a 
3-1 lead. The Tritons had their own 
six-on-five opportunity when Lions’ 
driver Ryan Friar was ejected from 
the game, but the Tritons seemed 
hesitant to shoot the ball, ending 
the first quarter two goals behind 

the Lions. 
The Tritons’ opened up the sec-

ond quarter with an outside goal 
from sophomore utility Sean Roberts. 
After a few minutes of tight defense 
from both sides, Donohoe tied the 
game at three with a goal from the 
flat. The Tritons followed that up 
with an outstanding possession on 
the defensive end, denying the Lions 

Tritons Take Two After Tough Loss

Lasting Legacy
Head coach Derek Armstrong’s abrupt 
departure has left many wondering 
whether the Tritons can continue the 
winnning tradition that Armstrong
