ERe takes the Shoe at Unolympics 
Sixtheams 
second in 

close match 
By GAiLLE FAURE 

News Editor 

Eleanor Roosevelt College took 
home the Golden Shoe to its new 
campus after beating the five other 
colleges in an afternoon of cheer 
and competition during this year's 
Unolympics. 

"It's really exciting," ERC 
junior TJ. Tallie said. "It's some-
thing that we've always wanted to 
have and it feels exceptionally 
sweet now that we have a brand-
new campus and we really feel like 
we have respect as a college." 

Sixth College, which had its 
first shot at winning the shoe in the 
2002 Unolympics, came just 
behind ERe.

UC goes green with 
environmetal policy 
Regents approve new 

standards for clean energy 
By MARNETTE FEDERIS 

Associate News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents 
approved a policy that calls for the 
design of "green" buildings and a 
standard for using "clean energy" 
on July 17. The reen Building 
Policy and Clean Energy Standard 
is one of the first policies of its kind, 
providing systemwide guidelines 
allowing the University of 
California to adopt principles of 
energy efficiency and su tainability 
for all of its capital projects. 

"The UC has always been inter-
ested in environmental su tainabil -
ity," aid Hanan Einsenman, a rep-

resentative from the UC Office of 
the President. "There is a responsi-
bility to be environmentally sus-
tainable in how the buildings are 
designed. It is a good example for 
students, and the University bene-
fits financially." 

The policy also cal ls for the 
reduction of non-renewable energy 
usage, consistent with budgetary 
constraints and requirements, by 
purchasing green power from elec-
trical grid, promoting energy effi-
ciency and creating local renewable 
resources.

celebrated for his work in thermonuclear 
fusion and its potential as a future ener-
gy source. 

Rosenbluth was awarded the National 
Medal of Science In 1997 for his work In 
nuclear fusion and plasma physics. 

After receiving his doctorate from the 
University of Chicago in 1949 at the age of 
22, Rosenbluth then began his research of 
the scattenng of relatiVistic electrons Within 
the nuclei, leading to his discovery of the

courses. 

The scien is also worked at he Los 
Alamos Scien Ific Laboratory In New 
Mexico as one of the principal theoreti-
Cians helping In the research that devel-
oped the hydrogen bomb. Rosenbluth

Future of transit in the works 
Local projects include Super Loop, LRT 

By MARNETTE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

In an effort to provide trans-
portarion alternatives, several 
transit projects in the design 
stages to build transit systems that 
wi ll affect UCSD and surround-
ing areas. 

These projects are parr of the 
Mid-Coast Tran it First study 
that analyzes and recommends 
tran portation improvements. 
T he study, which began in 
January 2002, also includes transit 

plans and projects that support 
circulation and operational 
improvements. 

"Through a combination of 
data analysiS and public input, the 
current Mid-Coast Transit First 
will produce a phased, compre-
hensive 20-plus year action plan," 
said Christine Rychel, project 
manager for the Metropolitan 
Transit and Development Board. 

On May 22, the MTDB 
pushed forward the creation of 
three recommended projects by 
pledging its support. The projects 

include the Super Loop, an 
extended bus service, and the 
implementation of the rapid tran-
sit system. 

This internal ci rculation sys-
tem will provide a local circula tor 
route similar to the U S)) 
Cityshuttle. The Super Loop sys-
tem provides roadway improve-
ments and priority lanes for vehi-
cle that are smaller and more 
Oexible than traditional buses.

Proposition 54 may be a step towards ending discrimination, but at what cost? 

pro I Ending discrimination begins with banning 
racial classifications 

Propo ition 54, wluch would 
ban local and state governments 
from classifying any individual 
according to his or her race, is an 
important step in ridding 
California of its institutionalized 
racism, both from those individu-
als till stuck in the pre-Civil 
Righrs state of mind, and those 
who believe racia: quotas :Ire 
somehow exempt from the term 
racism. 

California is an extremely 
diverse place. There are people 
of nearly every possible ethnicity 
living here in relative harmony. 
California is also probably the 
most progressive state in the 
Union. Various measures to 
eliminate racism, combined with 
the liberal mindset of the state's 
populati on, have made leaps and 
bounds in eliminating cenain 
forms of racism . The state of 
institutionalized racism, that i , 
raci m sanctioned by the govern-
ment , is a far cry from segregat-
ed proms still occurring in 
Georgia. 

However, with the good 
aspects of progressiveness come 
the damaging aspects, which 
constantly overstep their 
bounds. For example, hate crime 
legislation , a terrifyi ngly 
Orwellian set of rules , tries to 
decide whether there was a "spe-
cial" hate involved in a crime. 
The court, which decides what 
the defendant was thinking, can 
punish the defendant more 
har hly if they decide that he 
or she was hateful . 

process, however subtle they may 
be at California universities, 
which have supposedly banned 
racial quotas. And even if these 
students have a negligible amount 
of "minority blood," the state 
cannot really question their her-
itage. 

The subsequent idea of back-
ground checks and auditing of 
race is an absurd waste of time 
and onJy goes to how how hard 
race is to define already. If this 

ractice .~,,""~~ 

crimination increas-

minorities will be

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Recall more a spectacle than an exercise in democracy 
Debate demonstrates entertainment value of candidates rather than political prowess 

Quoth the 
ravin' 
Evan Mclaughlin 

T here's been a lot of talk about the Total Recall, and I'll be the first to admit 
that r enjoy tal lung about it. It was 
the hot tOpic in our nation's capital 
whi le I was there thi s summer and, 
as sti fling as it is, Californians are 
actually turning on the nightly 
news to learn about politics and not 
the usual high- peed car chase. 

The politically-constipated 
electorate of this state has been 
washing down ex-lax with 3 a.m. 
carne asada fries these past few 
months as the Total Recall has 
developed. And while the preced-
ing analogy may be a bit graphic, 
the result is even more disgusting. 

It took a congressman's mil-
lions, the banter of the A.M . radio 
waves and the gli tz of the 
Kindergarten Cop himself, but we 
have our Total Recall. And as soon 
as we could count our and certify 
those ignatures, the best and worst 
the Golden State has to offer 
became gubernatorial candidate, 
as child stars, B-list comic, 
wa hed-up punk singers, mut ped-
dlers and smut models, and even 
our very own Guardian opinion 
editor joined the ranks. 

While I admire the populist 
effort to co rrect the rnalfea ance of 
Sacramento in the wake of an over-
whelming deficit that has raised my 
tuition while cutting the service 
offered ro me al UC D, it stinks 

like most of the other direct 
democracy initiatives in our state. 
Here, Big Money can afford to 
publicize and promote in some of 
the nation's most expensive media 
markets while not a single 
California news channel has a cam-
era crew following the Sacramento 
action that's not from Sacramento. 
State politics is seen on commer-
cials and rarely in an objective light 
by most Californians. 

I could go on ravin' about the 
Total Recall in a detailed fashion all 
day, but space restrictions limit me 
to just a new paper column and not 
a "I larry Potter" installment. That 
being the case, I will be ripping off 
E PN columnist Bill Simmons' 
gimmick of the running diary by 
keeping an account of the Sept. 25 
debate, the first one including 
Republican frontrunner Arnold 
Schw3rzenegger. 

6 p.m. : Moderator Sta n 
Statham has informed us that 
tonight's debate features questions 
that have already been dispensed to 
the candidates. Could this be why 
Arnold was absent in the two pre-
ceding debates? The fact is that he 
has been spewing the same taglines 
about California's fiscal crisis while 
hiring on experts across the spec-
trum (Tycoon Warren Buffet, a 
democrat, and the former state sec-
retary under President Reagan, 
George Schulz) to not alienate any-
body right away. Arnold is as mar-
ketable a name in the political 
arena as he is in the box office after 
his tight affiliation with the 
Republ ican for years and his intro-
duction of Proposition 49 in 2002. 
He's an empty canvas that 
Republicans think they can ram 
down Californians' throats before 

pawning their policies onto him 
and eventually us if he's elected. 

6:01 p _m_: Arnold is the first 
candidate to speak and says he 
"thanks god everyday" for Hiram 
Johnson establishing the Total 
Recall clause in the constitution. 
It's already one minute into the 
debate and we can see why he has-
n't included himself in the first two 
debates. It's not like he was going 
to be out-shone on the charisma 
scale by then-candidate Peter 

" While I admire the pop~ 
ulist effort to correct me 

malfeasance of 
Sacramento in the wake 

of an overwhelming deficit 
that has raised my tuition 
while cutting me services 
offered to me at UCSD, 
it stinks like most of the 

other direct 
democracy initiatives " 
Ueberroth (po ibly the most bor-
ing man alive), but all he had to do 
was not be an idiot. Too late. 

6:02 p.m_ : State senator Tom 
McClintock al 0 explains why Total 
Reca ll is a great thing for 
California. He's known as a major 
policy wonk in Sac town and he 
exhibits that Reaganesque, So- al

Reps. David Drier or Chris ox. 
This is the guy most Republicans 
really want to run the state, but hey, 
he's no muscle-bound movie star 
who has a documented hi story of 
drug usc and group sex. Instead, 
this guy is compl etely uptight. H e 
looks like he's dizzy from taring at 
too many Magic E.ye posters. 

6: 13 p.m. : Statham interrupts 
Arnold 's diatribe against worker's 
compensation laws and immediate-
ly slips into the role of Will Ferrell 
playing Alex Trebek in th e 
"Celebrity J eopardy" skit from 
"Saturday ight Live." The rolling 
eyes, the condcscentling tone - it's 
all there. ta tham will prove hilari-
ous throughout the debate when 
trying to remind the shouti ng can-
didates that thi debate is for the 
governorship of Califo rnia and not 
"Paradise HoteL" Or is there eve n 
a difference? 

6:20 p .m_ : Lt. oV. Cruz 
Bustamante is spelling out a "tough 
love" plan that would make Ike 
Turner cringe. All these new taxes 
on Californians and there' still a $2 
billion of " unspecified" cuts o r rev-
enue in Bustamante 's plan. Two-to-
one odds it means more hikes at 
UC , anyone? He 's tryi ng the cold 
turkey route like the rest of the 
quick-fix candidates. 

6:22 p.m.: It look~ like Arianna 
Huffington 's only agenda in this 
debate is to slam Arnold and every-
one eI e at this point about their 
shortcommgs. Come on rianna, 
that job belongs to the ravi n '. 
Anyway, she shies away from noth-

women and malung violent movies,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Writer's comments 

unwarranted 
Editor: 

The following is in regard to 
the comments that Daniel Watts 
made in his ept. 23 article on stu-
dent organizations regarding 

tudent Affirmative Action 
Committee and Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan. 

I am a recent alumnus from 
UCSD and former member of 
UCSD MEChA, and I am offend-
ed by the ignorant comments that 
you have made in regards to 
MEChA and AAC From reading 
your commentaries, it is obvious 
that you have never even set foot in 
a MEChA or SAAC organization 
general body or board meeting. 
Therefore, r advise you to actually 
attend these meetings and you will 
understand that MEChA is not a 
"racist organization that 
denounces the gringo," and that 
MEChA does not "rarely live up to 
the hype" as you claim it does. 
SAAC and MEChA have made 
important contributions to UCSD, 
such as the Office of Academic 
Support and Instructional upport, 
from which student at UCSD 
have benefited from the excellent 
tutoring services it provides. 

The Cross Cultural Center is a 
place where individuals from all 
cultural backgrounds, creed, sexual 
orientations and genders can dia-
logue with another and learn from 
another in order to promote a con-
sciousness of the diversity that the 
campus has - a diversity that a 
small as it may be, is sti ll present. 

These are only two examples of 
contributions that I can give you of 
what AAC and MEChA have 
done to UCSD. I could be here all 
day writing to you everything that 
these organizations have con-
tributed to the UCSD community, 
but I will leave that for you to edu-
cate your elf and be more aware of 
what· is actually going on. As an 
undergraduate, MEChA wa a 
place for me where I would feel 
supported and identify with the 

struggles of other raza in the com-
munity. 

Hence, r ask that before you 
begin to write about any group of 
people, organization, or individual, 
that you actually educate yourself 
about the given topic to prevent 
making yourself look like an igno-
ramus that ha no basis for his 
argument.

Campus should be 
aware of ad's impact 

Editor: 
As a recent UCSD graduate, I 

returned the week after Labor Day 
to the campus at which I had pent 
the laS[ four years of my life matur-
ing as a cholar and a a citizen. 

Bearing in mind the vital role 
that the university play in in till-
ing young people such a myself 
with political, social and per onal 
awarenes , r feel it is my re ponsi-
bility to hare my thoughts with 
you on a matter that has troubled 
me over the past everal days. 
While pas ing through Price 
Center, r was gravely disturbed by 

the marketing display that con-
fronted me out ide of UCSD 
Bookstore. 

Someone had divided the dis -
play into large blue and pink pan-
els, labeled "For Him" and "For 
Her," respectively. Along with an 
array of UCSD sporting para -
phernalia, the masculine panel 
bore items such as Playboy maga-
zi nes, "Man track: How to 
Unhook a Bra With ne Hand," 
and "The Complete Assholes 
Guide to Handling Chicks," the 
latter by Karl Marks and Dan 
lndante. 

With complementary flourish, 
the other panel was adorned with 
marker of stereotypical femininity, 
including chic pink clothing and 
"The Hip Girls' Handbook for 
Home, Car, and Money ruff," by 
Jennifer Musselman and Party and 
Patricia Degregori. 

r find it deeply ironic that 
UCSD, a hotbed of progressive 
thought and a gathering place for 
those bonded by their commimlent 
to social change, would resort 10 
reproducing some of the mo t 
loath orne expressions of cultural 
violence toward women in ord~r 10 
market the products in its book-
store. 

The display's combination of 
conventional femininity with con-
sumeristic III t, as well as its mug 
promotion of the sexual fetishism 
and exploitation of female bodie, 
resonated more harply with a 
Coors Light commercial than with 
the diver e and dynamic selection of 
literature it was intended to adver-
tise. Such fhgrant acts of misogyny 
have ab lutely no place in ollr oci-
ety at large, much less at the 
Univer ity of Califorllla. 

I fear for the message that the 
book torc is ending to the 
incoming freshmen, current Stu-
dents and broadening alumni 
base, and I hope our scholarly 
comm unity will lIlorc close ly 
monitOr the store's marketin g 
strategies in the future .

My mind wandered after I starr-

the rest of this debate a it proved 
to be more about mud slinging and 
the entertainment of the audience 
than the policy it takes to get us 
back on our feet - much like the 
Total Recall itself. This chapter in 
our state's history has already 
become a joke in the eye of the 
rest of the nation, but after this 
debate, many Californians are 
jumping on the same idea. 

I've never been a fan of the Total 
Recall, but ( have to agree with 
Green candidate Peter Miguel 
Camejo when he says that thi 
coming election offers us an oppor-
tunity never really een before -
exposure of more than the usual 
twO or three candidates and a ense 

f urgency and eriousness that 
hould accompany any election but 

almost always fails to do o. 
I don't think Gray DaVIS, ary 

oleman or The lerminator is 
going to solve this problem 
overnight, so I'm voting 'no ' on n 
initiative I find wasteful and more 
corrupt than the problem it's trying 
to ameliorate. 

I only wish the expenence our

months will wake up the lceping

active in monitoring our state's

Patriot Ad a perilous precedent 
Legislation. should be re,examined 

By LOGAN GOH 
Senior staff writer 

One of the wonderful things 
about America is this thing called 
democracy. According to this 
bizarrt' idea, people should decide 
how they want their lives to be 
governed. One of the counterin-
tuitive results of this is that the 
process of revising law is not done 
by anyone person, but has an 
entire system of checks and bal-
ances, implemented by the 
Senate, House of Representatives 
and Supreme Court. 

It is generally considered a 
good idea to read a law before 
submitting approval of it, but in 
the aftermath of Sept. II, panic 
sometimes replaces reason. When 
the USA Patriot Act was passed, 
many of the representatives and 
senators voted in favor of it with 
what was most likely at best a cur-
sory reading of the provisions in 
its 342 pages. Despite its grand 
name, the Patriot Act had little to 
do with patriotism and much 
more to do with reducing, even 
eliminating in some cases, the 
checks and balances put on police 
powers. 

Many of the changes were not 
specific to terrorism. Police and 
federal agencies were given 
increased power to authorize wire-
taps and similar electronic surveil-
lance, not just on potential terror-
ists, but also on people suspected of 
other crimes. The provi ions were 
exceptionally harsh on the civil 
rights of immigrants, including 
increased powers to detain imrni-
grants without trial or lawyer. 

Most frightening was the 
revised defini tion for domestic 

terrorism, couched in such vague 
language that just about any polit-
ical organization or public pro-
testers could potentially be 
labeled as terrorists . It is not 
entirely fair to blame Congress for 
the passage of this freedom crush-
ing, liberty smiting bill. In the 
wake of Sept. II and the realiza-
tion of our vulnerability to attack, 
any action would have been better 
than no action. And so far, at least 
the government can claim that the 
Patriot Act has served its purpose. 

But just because there have 
been no new acts of terrorism 
does not necessarily mean that the 
Patriot Act is working as intended. 
Perhaps the terrorist network has 
been fatally crippled, though the 
Bush administration would have 
you think otherwise. Why would 
we continue to give him so much 
power? Perhaps all the terrorists 
have gone to Iraq, to fight on 
more familiar ground. Perhaps 
they have realized that any attack 
on American soil signals massive 
retribution and no longer dare to 
do it. Even if the Patriot Act is 
doing everything it says it does, it 
is till time to review it. 

We are in calmer times now, 
post-Mghanistan War, post-Iraqi 
War. Now would be a good time 
for Congress to reexamine the 
provisions of the Patriot Act, to 
see if they are sufficient to 
defend us against terrorism and 
also to see that they cannot be 
abused for other ends. Now 
would be a good time to return 
to that good 01' democracy, and 
have the people's representatives 
vote in a law after deliberating 
upon it, instead of having one 
man decide what's good for the 

entire United States. 
Instead, the administration is 

trying to introduce new, harsher 
laws that further restrict our civil 
rights. Immigrants aren't the tar-
get anymore. If passed, the new 
Patriot Act li will further loosen 
restrictions on wiretapping, ease 
rules on the use of secret evidence 
(i.e. we-are-right-we-won't-te ll -
you-why-just-trust-us evidence) 
and allow the secret detention of 
citizens. 

Justice department officials 
initially denied that they were 
drafting such a bill, and it was not 
until the nonpartisan Center for 
Public Integrity published a 
leaked draft that they acknowl-
edged its existence. 

But those who fear the loss of 
civil liberties in the name of 
national security should take 
heart. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-
OH) is pushing the Benjamin 
Franklin True Patriot Act, which 
would repeal most of the some-
what questionable effects of the 
Patriot Act li. 

The name is perhaps fitting, 
in light of the fact that it was 
Benjamin Franklin who once said 
that those who give up liberty in 
exchange for security deserve 
neither. 

Indeed security can only 
come from maintaining and 
upholding our liberties, because 
it is only then that we can ensure 
that our leaders do not turn on 
us. Our politicians are only as 
honest as we make them. The 
creation of a police state doesn't 
happen overnight. We should 
not let our civil liberties slide 
even an inch, so that it doesn 't 
happen at all.

moments of your collegiate career with DVI

Some of the criticisms of 
Proposition 54 are of legitimate

schools from monitoring rise and 
decline of minority attendance. 
This is untrue. While it would be 
more difficult, universities would 
still be able to measure racial data. 
The proposition only prohibits 
the local and state government 
from identifying individuals

prohibit private companies from

Connerly: Proposition 54 
is poorly planned 

continued from page 4 
demned the initiative as misguided, 

cou~terpro~uctlve, and danger-
ous, accordtng to 1JJ'WIJJ.1IIoveol1.07-g. 
Gubernatorial candidates Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Cruz 
Bustamante, Peter Camejo and 
Arianna H urfington all oppose the 
proposition. 

Aside from the overt bigots, 
however, some are tending to 
favor Proposition 54 as a method 
of eliminating any possibility of 
affirmative action. 

" 

For omeone who wants 
California to deny the existence of 
race as an immensely important 
social factor, onnerly i sure 
as iduous about describing hi s 
own background : "one-quarter 
Black, three-eighths Irish, o ne-
quarter French and one-eighth 
Choctaw." lIe rejects the 13 bel 
"African-American," pOSSIbly 
because he has systematically and 
co ntinually betrayed the black 
community. After contributing to

That's misguided, 
however, because 
Prop 54 would 
have far-reaching 
and detrimental 
effects beyond 
affirmative action . 

Eliminating 
any possibility of 
enacting affirma-
tive action, no 
matter how repul-
sive you consider 
it to be, is simply 
not worth the sti-
fling of important 
racial information 

Aside from the overt 
bigots , some are 
tending to favor 

Proposition 54 as a 
method of 

eliminating ... 
affirmative action. " 

affirmative action 
in California in 
1995, through 
campaigning for 
Proposition 209, 
an African-
American maga-
zine dubbed him 
"the most hated 
Black man in 
America . " 
Proposition 54 is 
simply his latest 
attack on racial 
equa li ty III 
California. 

at the expense of 
California's health care, educa-
tion, housing and other vital ser-
vices in regards to all racial 
groups. 

Let affirmative action be a sep-
arate is ue to work out later, and 
view Proposition 54 as it is: an 
effort to keep California ignorant 
of the very knowledge we need to 
move toward a fair and equal soci-
ety. 

Proposition 54 is detrimental, 
even to the typical white male who 
can't understand the reas n 
behind affirmative action. ome 
diseases, such as heart disea e, have 
a uisproportional prevalence 
among whites and deserve to be 
studied. 0 one suffers in a ocietr 
that' fair for all races. 

Connerly's 
backwards and 

destructive views on race, and his 
disturbing ties to conservative 
interest such as the Bradley 
Foundation (who upported his 
book "Creating Equal : My Fight 

gainst Race Preference" as well 
as Herrnstein and Murray's "The 
Bell urve," which argues that 
blacks are genetically inferior to 
whites), make him appear woefully 
unqualified to be a UC Regent. 
California has probably the most 
pressing ra lal issues f any tate in 
the nion, and this well-connect-
ed, highly influential mall - a lIlan 
of mixed race, no less - not only 
has grossly ignorant view. of race, 
but drafts a proposal that, if pa;,;,cd, 
IV uld cripple any hope of equality 
rn this state. 

Prop 54: Propo ition's 
wording allow for leeway 

continUl!d from page 7 
patientS, it would indeed be a sor-
did bill. However, it does not. In 
fact, it explicitly offers this excep-
tion: "Otherwise lawful cia silica-
tion of medical research subjects 
and patients shall be exempt from 
this section." 

Further critiei ms say that 
Proposition 54 doesn't allow for all 
forms of racial health information, 
such as information taken from 
"birth and death certificates, [and] 

" 

logical reque t, the government 
would have no problem overturn-
ing any problems the health field 
would have with Proposition 54's 
wording. For that matter, any isslle 
based primarily on the wording of 
the proposition may be rectified by 
the legislature under this clause.

siveness while destroying the

Super Loop: 
Rapid transit 
developed to 
reduce traffic 

continued from page 3 
use priority treatments that might 
include queue jump lanes, tran it-
only lanes and special stage at the 
signal for transit phases. The sys-
tem will be focused around major 
activity centers in the Golden 
Triangle including Univer ity 
Towne Centere, future Nobel 
Coaster tation and UCSD. 

According to Clifton Walker, 
legi lative analyst for Councilman 
SCOtt Peters, the Super LoOp pro-
ject will better move people around 
the Golden Triangle. 

"Traffic studies have shown that 
improving internal circulation of 
this area could take as many as 50 
percent of the car trips in the area 
off the streets," Walker said. "This 
would dramatically reduce traffic." 

The uper Loop project has also 
received support · from several 
group and snldents from the com-
munity. According to jonn Muir 
College senior jeremy Bamberger, 
who helped with petitions in sup-
port of the projects, said student 
support was essential in helping to 
push the transit projects forward . 

"I feel that this addition to pub-
lic tran portation will largely bene-
fit the traffic and parking ituation 
on campus, benefiting those with 
and without personal vehicles," 
Bamberger said. 

Environmental and preliminary 
engineering work on the Super 
Loop is currently underway. The 
transi t system is expected to open 
December 2006. 

One project currendy in review 
that could affect UCSD is the 
development of the Light Rail 
Transit system. 

There are four proposed align-
ments tnat could run through cam-
pus with either one or two stations. 
According to Campus Community 
Planner Milton Phegley, the more 
feasible two-station alignment 
would provide a west campus sta-
tion in Pepper Canyon and a sec-
ond station on east campus. 

"UC D still supports a two- ta-
tion alternative and believes that 
increased mass transit service 
hould be provided to the ca mpus 

as soon as possible," Phegley said. 
The MTDB and the San Diego 

As ociation of Government, or 
SANDA ,a re still studying poten-
tial alignments. Once the 

ANDA Transportation 
CommIttee selects and endorses a 
preferred alignment, further pre-
lilninary planning and engineering 
work can continue. 

"TillS is important because once 
there is a preferred aligrunent, then 
UC D and the community can 
begin to strongly advocate for a par-
ticular project rather than an 
unknown alignment," Phegley said. 

J Iowever, according t Walker, 
the trolley and other fixed -rail ser-
vices can run from $ 0 millIOn to 
$100 milli n per 111IIe to build . 
Another project abo in design is the 
expres bu rapid transit sy~tcm that

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Prop. 54: Campaign includes 
voter registration effort 

continued from page I 
resignation of the ASUC's external 
affairs vice president and of the 
Graduate Assembly's president. 

According to Harish 
Nandogopal, UCSD's A.S. vice 
president of external affairs, the 
office of external affairs received a 
letter from tudent Policies and 
judicial Affairs Director icholas S. 
Aguilar citing twO pieces of policy 
restraining the funding toward the 
campaign. 

"I'm perturbed that this has 
come up so late, after months of 
planning, and I wish it had been 
talked about earlier," Nandagopal 
said. "This is really old, contradic-
wry policy. It's so inconsistent they 
can bring out anything they want 
for any situation." 

The campaign against Prop. 54 
has been visible at UCSD through 
flyers and posters, and has been led 
by the Office of External Affairs in 
conjunction with a coalition of stu-
dents and student organizations 
registered in fall 2002, calling 
themselves the Coalition Against 
the Information Ban. According to 
Nandagopal, the active campaign 
against Prop. 54 has thus far been 
mosdy centered on Youth Vote, but 
also involves phone-banking both 

UCSD students and members of 
the community, precinct-walking 
and tabling in front of stores popu-
lar with young people. In addition, 
Nandagopal and A.S. President 
Jeremy Paul Gallagher went to the 
San Diego City Chamber of 
Commerce Meeting on cpt. 2S to 
speak Out against Prop. -4, a stance 
which the chamber itself later 
adopted. 

According to andagopa l, no 
money has been allocated to the 
ca mpaign, but if he had allocated it 
along the way, it would have come 
from the A .. Budget's "outreach, 
forums and rallies" line-i tem. 
However, for the time being, the 
campaign will go on being funded 
by students ' personal funds, and no 
students will be reimbur ed by the 
office for their expenses. 

"We're going full speed ahead 
right now," Nandagopal said. 
"We're pretty positive the proposi-
tion is going to fail, but we're not 
going to ~top working." 

The policies cited by Aguilar, 
according to Nandagopal, are sec-
tions 83. 10 of UC policy on student 
goverrunents and section 15. 11.20 
of UC policies applying to Campus

Gubernatorial candidate Dan 
Fetnstein suggests a guaranteed 
baseline funding for public high-
er education, similar to 
Proposition 98 used in kinder-
garten through 12th grade. 

"Cutting back fees is impor-
tant, but we must also re tore

they are not getting more fund-

In the early 1990s, 
F ei n tei n protested in 
Sacramento with fellow 
California State University 
students against the 40 percent 
fee increases. 

"It 's important for students 
to mobilize and become politi-
cally active," Feinstein said. 

Watts agreed with Feinstein 
on the need for students and oth-
er concerned to get involved. 

" tudent fees affect more

have an extra $11,000. A lo! of

dents running," Watts aid . 

Watts felt that his effort 
have been successful. 

"I know I am making a dif-
ference," he said. 

Watts fclt that third-party

10 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY. EmMBER 29. 2003 

Preuss: Educati n cut mans chool must lease buses on its own 
cominued from page 1 

without the bu e ," aid Nancy 
andoval, a senior at the Preuss 
chool who is currendy interning 

at cri pps In titute of 
ceanography with hope of 

attending UC D ne).1: fall. "~'hen 
I found out [about the transporta-
tion cut] I thought the school 
might hut down because everyone 
take the bu ." 

The funding for Preuss buses 
comes from the local chool dis-
trict, which was deva tated by 
California's massive $8 7 million 
cut in educaoonal Kindergarten-I 2 
funding last year. Preu trans-
portation was one of the fir t casu-
alties. 

Thus, the school must lease 
bu e every year until a long-term 
solution i reached. 

The Sept. 26 rally was held in 
front of the Preuss chool campus, 
where a bus draped in banners 
proclaiming "Jack's Bus" was 
parked, filled with waving Preuss 
tudents. 

The primary speaker was Jack 
in the Box's spokes per on, Jack. 
The sphere-head took the podium 

next to Preuss Principa l and 
Director Doris Alvarez and 
As ociated tudent Body President 
Michele Valdez. 

''I'm going to call this Jack's 
bu ," he said. " Doe anyone have a 
problem with that? ow I'd like to 
chri ten this bu - but forget the 
champagne." 

" I thought the school might 
shut down because 

everyone takes the bu.s . " 
-Nancy Sandoval, 

Preuss SChool senior 

He held up a Jack in the Box 
milkshake and brandished it at the 
crowd. Then he made his way over 
to thc bus and slammed it into the 
back, so that the shake splattered. 

The Preuss chorus class al 0 
took the stage and sang in front of 
the new bus. 

Valdez spok e briefly about 
Preuss's academic quality. 

"Without our buses, many of 
the students would not be able to 
receive the unique education the 
school has to offer," she said . 

The Preus chool, located on 
UCSD's East Campus, is a public 
school dedicated co providing a 
high -quality education to low-
income students in ixth through 
12th grades. tudents are chosen 
by lottery from families who have 
never been co college. 

Preuss' academic accomplish-
ments rate the school 10 out of 10 
among schools with similar demo-
graphies. The current 2004 class 
will be the first to graduate from 
the school. 

"The quality of education at 
Preu s literally changes lives," said 
Kathy Kovacevich, director of the 
Jack in the Box Foundation . "We 
hope that our donation will 
inspire other corporations to step 
forward with donations of their 
own."

Berndes, sports club director for 
UCSD Recreation and master of 
ceremony of the event. "I thought 
there was more school spirit and 
creativity than I've seen in the past. 
Everybody had a good time." 

tudents participating in the 
event started by partaking in pre-
Unolympic rallies on their 
respective campuses before flood -
ing RIMAC Field with chants of 

"We want the shoe.» 
The first criteria judged was 

the entrance by each college pre-
senting their respective theme to 
the jury with dancing and cheer-
ing. Themes ranged from a jungle 
theme for John Muir College to a 
1950s theme for Thurgood 
M arshall College to a 'Top Gun" 
theme for ERe. 

Sixth College, whi ch per-
fo rmed to the th eme o f 
"Ghostbusters" with zombie-like 
costumes and one student emerg-
ing from a coffin, won best 
en trance, followed by Marshall, 
which performed to songs from 
uGrease." 

Sixth College kept the lead by 
winning the cheer category, with

one student leader prompting the 
cheers by yelling, "Two times three 
is ... ? How many sides to a hexa-
gon ... What sounds like ... ?" and 
more questions to which the crowd 
of Sixth College students shouted 
"Six" in reply. ER came in sec-
ond, chanting "When everything is 
said and dOlle, ERC will be top 
gun." 

Sixth College still led after the 
third event, the bat relay, despite 
ERC narrowly beating ixth 
College. 

The competition remained 
fierce during the water balloon 
relay, with Revelle College win-
ni ng the race followed by Earl 
Warren College, but ER in third 
place beat fifth-place ixth ollege 
bringing the two frontrunners to a 
10-point difference, with Sixth still 
in the lead. 

The tug-of-war, which counted 
for double points, brought the 
competition to a close with several 
tough matches. Judges disqualified 
Muir in its first match against 
ERC for having one too many 
players on the field . 

Sixth College supported Muir's 
cause with cries of "rematch" until 
they were rein tated a few minutes 
later and lost to ERC ill the 
rematch. 

By the end of the contest, ERC 
came out on top with 300 points, 
followed by Sixth College with 
270, Warren with 130, Marshall 
with 170, Revelle with 160 and 
Muir with 130. 

"For those of us that are 
seniors, we lost the shoe our fresh-
man year so to get it back our 
senior year was always our goal," 
E RC senior and resident advisor 
Crystal Fecht said. "It wa really 
cool to get it back before we grad-
uated."

self confidence," ERC senior sena-

Jessic.l HortOl1/Cuorcfon 
Construction continues: Freshmen at Eleanor Roosevelt College 
are still dealing with the annoyances of wnstruction in their dorms. 

W ith their mihds and hearts filled with fears, expecta-tions, hopes and countless emonons, &eshmen eagerly begin a new chapter in their lives that the 
rest of us can all remember: the fir t year of college. 

From television and movies, one might obtain numerous 
ideas of what coll ege life is like. [mage of college life can 
range &om ilent libraries filled with studious srudentS to 
fraternity houses packed with drunken partygoers. 

But whcn it comes down to it, freshmcn at UCSD have 
very basic and understandable expectations of what their 
college experience will be. 

"1 think college is going to be hard in many ways," said 
T hurgood Marshall College &eshman Robert Shapiro. "[ 
feel like my high school classes will seem super easy com-
pared to college courses. Also, I think because we are ina 
new environment with new people, we will be fotced out of 
our comfort zone-which ,viII be tough at first, but will 
probably make us stronger and more marure." 

Going &om mall, personal classrooms in high school to 
large, impersonal lecture halls characteristic of large univer-
sities, is a huge change for mo t students. Many expect that 
this acade(nic change will bring a new set of worries. 

<II think a challenge of college is the class sires," aid 
Revelle College & hmanJennifcr Hirsh. "We're used to mall 
30-person class sizes and now some cia will be a couple 
hundred people. 1 think the hardest thing will be keeping our-
selves accountable for getting everything done on time." 

Breaking away from the ccurity of home and the depen-
dence on their parent brings a new array of challenges for 
first-years. ot only are freshmen forced to ocialize with a 
completely new grou p of people, but they al 0 must adapt to 
living in dorms. 

"I think the hardest challenge is studying on your own," 
Mar hall &eshman Takumi Kato said. "You can always ay 
'I' ll do it later,' but will you really do it?" 

While freedom i exciting, adjusting to it can be difficult. 
"lne freedom of college can be a challenge," Hir ch 

sa id. " ome people may take advantage of Il and do things 
that they'll regret. Iso, shyness and homesickness can be a 
challenge to many first years who are awOlY from home fur 
the first time." 

ther ob. tades freshmen often face lie deeper than get-
ting 10 ton ampu or running out of meal POlltts. dapting 
to a completely new place can elllotionally affect anyone 111

"I think freshmOin year can be a humbling experience," 
haplro said. "You will prob~bly be Ie s confident since your 

old friend ' aren't around to make you feel secure. I think 
fre hmJn year can be lonely for some people because wc're 
used to having a con tant group of friends in high school. In 
college, you ha"e to start over with none." 

Freshmen are expecung that college will either help them 
along the path in life they havc already et out for t11cmsdvcs, 
or help them find a path suitable to them for a successful jour-
ney. While ome are keeping their career options open, others 
are certain on what they want to do in life. 

"I'm coming to college hoping to explore and see what 
options 1 have for a career," Hirsh aid. "Right now, ['m a 
communication major with intentions of going into journal-
ism. However, I want to take a lot of general education 
requirements 0 that I get a feel of different areas of life, and 
maybe find an area that's better suited to me." 

Despite the challenges freshmen are anticipating, they 
are also looking forward to the positive aspectS of college 
life. Most fre hmen agree that the best times in coll ege do 
not revolve around what one learns in class, but instead 
around the experiences they will have with new &iends. 

"The highlights of starting college definitely have to be 
hanging out with new people, especially your suitemates and 
roommates," Kato said. "1 am looking forward to meeting 
new pcople ... and possibly having a girlfriend." 

Freshman year may be a life changing experiencc fot 
many new students, but the life les ons and self-discoveries 
will certainly not top there. By the end of their college 
careers, many freshmen anticIpate numerous changes to 
occur in their behavior and thought. 

"This year, I hope to accomplish a cnse of independence," 
Hirsh said. "Right now, I feel very dependent on my parents." 

orne fre hmen hope to grow in maturity an I understand 
111 rc about life in general. 

"\ think from the beginning of my college life until the 
end, I'll become way more mature and less naive. I'll defi -
nitely under tUJ1d the repercussions of procrastll1:lting lnd 
hopefully learn from them," Kato saId. 

By the end of these ren months, &eshmen expecrarions of 
college moy be pr v~n trlle or fal e, but overall it WIll be J

Learn how to lock it up every time 
Students protect their bikes with safety advice 

By VALERIE Ne; 
Staff Writer 

On a spread-out campu like 
VCSD, bikes are priceless objects. 
Bur, despite investment in bike 
locks, bike theft is a major problem 
on college campuses, miling bicycle 
ownership frustrating. Throughout 
the UC system, more than half of 
property crime involve bicycle 
theft. Research suggests that student 
cycli ts have a 17 percent chance of 
losing their bicycles, but taking into 
account unreported thefts they fact! a 
53 percent chance of losing their 
bike. Although police recover almost 
half of all stolen bikes, they are only 
able to return about 3 percent 
because they cannot match the bike 
to the owner. 

To avoid becoming another sta-
tistic, there are several simple steps 
you can take. First, buy a high-
quality lock. A cheap lock will only 
waste your money and give you a 
false sense of security because they 
can easily be picked. The design of 
the lock should provide functional 
ecurity. olid steel is strongest, 

making it hard to cut, but the best 
rypes maintain Aexibility. It's 
important to check out the lock's 
performance record, warranty and 
lifetime key registration and 
prompt key replacement services. 
Don't buy a lock that is larger than 
it needs to be, because thieves can 
take advantage of the extra space 
between your lock and your bike. 

Once you buy it, be sure to u e 
your lock. In high bike theft areas, 
you may even consider having two 
locks. Combine a cable and a V-
lock, or two U-locks. If it takes 
more time and trouble to unlock 
your bike, your bike is less likely to 
become a target for thieves. 

Lock your bike to a fixed, 
immovable object. Campus police 
recommend using only the official 
bike racks provided since it is pro-
hibited to lock bikes to objects 
such . as parking meters and 
handrails. Don't lock your bike to 
an item that can easily be cut, bro-
ken or removed. Position the bike 
frame and wheels so you can fill up 
or take up as much of the open 
space withm the U-portion of the 
lock as possible, malong it more 
difficult for a thief to insert a pry 
bar to pry open your lock. AI 0 , 
don't rest your lock against the 
ground, where a thief can easily 
sma hit. 

Most importantly, lock your 
bike up every nme. Unlocked bikes 
can be stolen from anywhere, 
Including garages, dorm rooms, 
porches and yards. The one orne 
you don't lock it, it may be stolen. 

Lock your bike in a VIsible, well-
lit area where most thieves won't 
want LO be een . In addition,

Now students can keep in shape and study at the same time 
Desk fitness tips help prevent fatigue and stress while hitting the books th is Fall 

By ANN IE YANG 
Staff Writer 

Studying or sitting in front of 
the computer for long hours can be 
strenuous on the mind and also the 
body. A college student's sedentary 
life tyle can oftentimes lead to 
stress, fatigue and stiffness in the 
mu des. 

No time to hit the gym? No 
motivation? There arc some easy 
solutions to help keep you in shape 
during your busy schedule. For 
those students who suffer from the 
above symptoms after spending 
hours upon hours at the desk, there 
may be an answer - desk fitness. 

T he funda mental mechanisms 
to effective desk fitness include 
proper breathing, stretching (flexi-
bility exercises) and strengthening 
exercises, which loosen the muscles 
and make them stronger. A simple 
set of stretches conducted before 
the study period can help prevent 
or alleviate joint and muscle stiff-
ness. Setting an alarm on your 
computer or on your desk helps 
you remember to exercise at least 
five times a day. 

The following simple exercise 
techniques found at 
http::IIW'W'W.aarogyll.clmI, a Web site 
dedicated to personal well ness, can 
all be performed at or near the 
desK. The exercises enable you to 
reduce stress, build endurance, 
tone muscles and take a quick break 
from that horrid paper or math 
homework. 

andra Martinez., a John Muir 
College junior, is a typical hard-
working student who does not have 
a lot of time to go to the gym. She 
performed the following set of 
exercises and offer her feedback 
about the effectiveness of each one. 

FuU body stretch at the wall 
For this exercise, tand up. Face 

the wall and reach your fingers up 
as far as you can. While you stretch 
upwards, place your feet firmly on 
the floor. Firm up your legs, extend 
the side of the torso and bring your 
shoulder blades toward the wall. 
Breathe normally as you stretch, 
walking your finger up the wall. 

Move back a few inches away 
from the wall so that your torso is 
diagonal to your hips and press 
both palms onto the wall equall y. 
Press into the ground with your 
feet, firm up your legs and re lease 
your tai lbone away from the wall. 
Lift up your ribs and let your head 
drop slightly. 

"I've done the first stretch 
before, sometimes before r work 
out," Martinez aid . "1 have never 
thought about doing it before I 
work at my desk. The second 
stretch fclt really good . I felt it 
e pecially in my arms and upper 
back." 

Posture 
To maintain good po tuTe, prac-

tice itting with an upright torso. 
For thi exercise, sit upright with 
the ides of your t rso extending 
and your head re ting comfortably 
on your neck. Bring your hand 
down to the seat of your chair and 
roll your shoulders back, bringing 
the shoulder blades into your back. 

"Most of the time, 1 don't sit up 
straight when 1 am seated at my 
desk," Martinez said. " 1 know that

is really bad for my po ture and 
back. This exercise helped loosen 
my shoulders and especially my 
back. I even heard some cracking, 
probably a sign that I haven't done 
a lot of physical activity lately." 

Opening your chest 
Interlock your fingers behind 

your back with your palms facing 
your torso. Rotate your shoulders 
back, but avoid keeping your ribs 
from poking forward. Stretch your 
elbow and ?rms while exhaling and 
hold it for a few breaths. While 
exhaling, bend your elbows and 
bring your wrists to the right side 
of your waist, gently pressing the 
right elbow toward the left. Release 
and do the other side, then repeat 
yet again with your fingers inter-
locked with the opposite thumb on 
top. 

"I liked this stretch a lot," she 
said. "This exercise, like the previ-
ous one helps me maintain a prop-
er posture while at my desk. [ am 
also stretching out my arms. J 
would probably reduce my tenden-
cies to slouch if J do this prior to 
every stu dy session. The upper half 
of my arm feels good while I do this 

stretch." 
Shaking out tension 

Shake out your wrists and arms, 
letting them dangle from your 
shoulders. Rotate your houlders 
forwards and backwards. 

"I feel weird doing this," she 
aid. ") Iowever, it is really stre s-

relieving, like I am haking away 
everything that's bothering me." 

" It is really stress--reUeving, 
like I am shaking away 

everything that's bothering 
me. " 

- Sandra Martinez. junior, 
John Muir Colleje 

Back/stomach 
In a seated position, raise both 

your arms; then while lowering and 
raising your chin, bend your chest 
backwards. 

"I actually felt more pain 
because I felt a lot of strain in my 
necK, which made the lowering and 

raising of my chin dirficult," 
Martinez sa id. 

Neck push 
This is an isometric exercise 

that will trengthen your neck mus-
cles and prevent ten ion In that 
area. Gra p your chin with the 
palms of both your hand. Bend 
your head forward as far as POSSI-
ble. Try to push your head back 
with your hands, while rcsi ting it 
with your neck muscles. Very slow-
ly, against the tension, push your 
head backwards all the way. 
Resume the original position. 
Repeat so your body can fully expe-
rience the stretch. 

"1 can see how this will 
strengthen my neck muscles, but it 
was uncomfortable," Martinez. said. 
"The lower back of my neck kind 
of hurts after the exercise." 

T he arm press 
With your elbows bent, push 

your palms together as hard as pos-
sible. Hold this position of maxi-
mum tension for 1 0 seconds, then 
relax and repeat. 

"It sounds so simple. But if you 
do it repetitiously, it gets tiring," 

Martinez said. "f think this will help 
mc tone my bicep. f don't like 
weightlifting, 0 this is a nice exer-
cise to do. My arms felt a lot of strain 
beca use they had to su pport IllOSt of 
my body weight. 1 can see how this 
can really work out the arms." 

hair step-ups 
Step up with your right leg to 

full extension on a chair. tep back 
down; repeat with your left leg. 
Alternate your legs, steppi ng up 
and down with increasing speed. 
Try to do this without stopping for 
a minute. Gradually, try to increase 
the amount of time you do this 
exercise at one time. Make sure 
your chair is stable and your seat is 
not tOO high.

Use these helpful exercises in

denied, CSUSB took another close 
game 30-27 before being annihilat-
ed 30-16 by the Tritons in game 
four. 

Though momentum should 
have been squarely on the UCSD 
bench, mistakes plagued the 
Tritons in game five with UCSD 
committing seven hitting errors in 
the final game. The Coyotes' 15-12 
win secured the 3-2 victory in the 
match. 

The miscues down the stretch 
perplexed and frustrated many of 
the Triton players. 

"We made mistakes in the fifth 
game that we didn't even make in 
the first game," Crandell said. "It's 
a leI down because it's over and 
they didn't even Mve a great game. 
We could have taken it from them 
while they were down." 

Crandell once again earned 
team-high honors with 19 kills, 
while Kim Morohunfola put down 
25 for CSUSB. The statistics

with 13 blocks. 

What has been an intense, emo-
tional and sometimes personal 

rivaJry in the past seemed more 
subdued. At the opening, Crandell 
- a newcomer to the rivalry -
noticed something tentative about 
the Coyote players that the Tritons 
were unable to capitalize on. 

"I felt that they were kind of 
scared of us," she said. "The atti-
tude wasn't there. They seemed 
scared to make the mistakes." 

CSUSB's timidity may have 
been matched by UCSO's overcon-
fidence. 

"I just don't think we eKpected 
10 lose," Canape saiel. "[The loss) 
was a surprise almost." 

The results of the neKt 
American Volleyball Coaches' 
Association poll will be released on 
Sept. 3D, but should UCSD fall, the 
Tritons have a clear idea in mind as 
to when they mighl retake the top 
spot. 

"When [CSUSB) comes back to 
RIMAC on Halloween, we're defi-
nitely going to be ready, and the 
energy's going to be through the 
roof," Canape said . 

Crandell was willing to go a bit 
further in her prediction. 

"We're really excited to play 
them at home because we know 
were going to kick their ass," she 
said. 

continued from page 28 
ejection to CSULAl; Paula Wirel, 
the Tritons were able to score 
again. Senior All-American Kristin 
Jones scored her third goal of the 
season on a pass from freshman 
Kelly Cochran. 

"We were able to keep our cool 
and come right back and score," 
De La Rosa said. 

The Tritons defense did its 
part when it had to. Junior Jamie 
Lautenschleger, in only her sec-
ond start at goalie fo r the 
Tritons, had two aves over the 
first 55 minutes while sopho-
more Alyson Berger added one 
more stop. 

With the win, the Tritons 
remain undefeated on the season 
at 8-0, 6-0 in the CeM. CSU 
drops to 2-7, and 1-5 in the 

CCAA. T he Tritons next hosted 
No. 21 CSU Dominguez Hi ll s, 
but results were unavailable at 
press time. 

Tyler Huff/CuorcflOn 
In pursuit: UCSD's sophomore Lindsey Treankler tries to win the ball from a CSU Los Angeles player in the Tritons' 
shutout of the Golden Eagles on Sept 26. UCSD will next be in action on Oct. 3, hosting Chico State at 7 p.m.

THE UCSD UARDIAN M NDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2oo} 

Water polo: UCSD cannot keep up with the high .. powered Bruins 
continued from page 28 

us to not be as tentative in the 
offen e," Harper said. "Vie didn't 
really attack. We didn't play with 
a lot of reckle s abandon like we 
usually do." 

IVter a power play goal by 
U LAS Josh Hewko for a 2 -0 lead 
early in the second quarter, the 
Triton offense awakened from its 
luggish start. Drawing upon a six-

on-five advantage near the UCLA 
goal with 2:20 left in the half, 
UCSD senior Matt Ellis flicked a 
quick lob to redshirt ophomore 
Chris Finegold at 2 meters. 
Finegold bolted loose from his 
defender, received the pass with 
ease, and fired the ball past the sur-
prised UCLA goaltender to give 
UCSD its first tally on the score-
board and cut the Bruin lead to 2-
I. 

Ellis' goal fai led to spurn an 
offensive attack before halftime. 
UCLA was awarded another power 
play on the very next po session 
and capitalized with I : 10 left for a 
3-\ scoreline. With time running 
out, the Bruins drew yet another 
ejection at the UCSD end. UCLA's 
Tyler Kllndel to sed a bounce shot 
into the left corner that gave 
UCLA a slim, yet commanding 4-1 
lead at the half. 

"The gist of the second quarter 

was tha t our offense failed US; 
[UCLA) scored three and we 
couldn't answer back, which never 
happens,» Ellis said. 

Frustration continued to plague 
the UCSD players in the second 
half as the Bruin defense proved to 
be stifling at times. Bad luck also 
seemed to follow the Tritons in the 
water as orne promising shots only 
amounted to a "kerplunk" as they 
bounced off of posts. 

UCLA's Brett Ormsby added a 
goal to the Bruin lead to begin the 
third quarter. Junior Jonathan 
Hopkins countered the UCL 
score with UCSD's only other 
power play success. '{'he Tritons 
managed a couple of inspired 
charges late in the game, but could 
not rake advantage of thc offensive 
infusions provided by Hopkins and 
Steven J endrusina 's goal with \ : \ 2 
left. 

"Those late goals were big 
momentum changer, but when 
you start to rally and you can't take 
advantage ... the game could have 
been ours," junior Brandon Bor 0 
said. 

Despite the disparities on the 
offensive side of rhe pool, 
UCSD's defensive efforts proved 
to be one of the lone bright spots 
of the evening. The Tritons uc-
ceeded in holding the Bruin squad

to only five goals in the match. 
When the defense wasn't pressur-
ing, sophomore goaltender Colin 
McElroy was giving his all to 
deny UCLA, picking up eight 
saves in the match. 

The biggest disappointment of 
all was the one the players held 
against thcmselves for failing to 
pick up the hi toric victory over 
the Bruins. Many of the players felt 
that this was their best opporrunity 
for the win. The postgame mood 
was a somber one among the 
squad. 

"We had the opporrunity to 
beat a team we never beat," Ellis 
said, "but we trashed it by losing 
to, what 1 thought, was a subpar 
UCLA team." 

As the Tritons prepare for the 
upcoming NorCal tournament on 
Ocr. 4 and Oct. 5, the team hopes 
to rebound from the loss very 
quickly. However, when the new 
rankings are released on Oct. I, 
don't expect Ellis, Borso or any of 
the other players to pay close 
attention. 

"If anything, this helps because 
there is a thin line between confi-
dence and cockines ," Borso said. 
"This gives us a reminder that we 
are beatable and must always play 
hard, no matter what some num-
bers say."

Men's soccer gets decisive win over CSULA 
Tritons open four-game home stand with a 3-1 victory 

By ANU KUMAR 
Associate Sports Editor 

deflected off a defender and found the left 
corner of the goal. 

Going into its matchup against C U Los 
Angeles on Sept. 26, the UCSD men's soc-
cer team faced a bit of a challenge from head 
coach Derek Armstrong. The coach felt that 
the Tritons had not played up to their capa-
bilities and wanted to use the contest against 
the 3-3-2 Golden Eagles as a tune- up 
before a tough game against CSU 
Dominguez hills on Sept. 28 . 

Against CSULA, UCSD began to show 
some signs that the team i reaching its 
potential in a 3 -\ victoty over the Eagles at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 

UCSD got off to a 51 ow start in the ftrst 
game of a four-game home stand, with 
CSULA controlling the ball on the Tritons' 
side of the field for the majority of the first 
15 mi nutes of the game. 

Once UCSD managed to get the ball on 
the Eagles' half, the Tritons just dribbled 
directly into the CSULA defense on the 
left side of the field, instead of crossing it 
over to midfielder Brett Maurer, who 
seemed to be on a different field because 
there was usually no one near him. 

Around the 22-rninute mark, UCSD for-
ward David Amaya had the ball and wa 
working down the left side near the CSULA 
goal, attracting the defense to him. Maurer 
was making a run down the right side, yelling 
for the ball while there was no one in front of 
him. After Amaya had the ball kicked out of 
bounds, Maurer went over and conferred 
with hi teammate. Then, JUSt three minutes 
later, the Tritons worked the ball down the 
right sideline and midfielder Jon Krupansky 
took a short touch pass from Maurer and put 
It behind the C ULA goalkeeper Ricky 
Gonzalez. 

in the econd half, the Triton increased 
their 1-0 lead at the 50:5 J mark when mid-
fielder Matthew Davey took a long-range 
shot from ju t outside the penalty box thar 

After CSULA cut the UCSD advantage 
again to just one in the 68th minute with a 
goal from midfielder Kota Taniyama, the 
Tritons iced the game eight minutes later. 
The UCSD goal came after forward Tiago 
Venturi had a shot blocked by onzalez and 
Maurer took the rebound to put it at the 
back of the net. 

Venturi, who led the team in scoring and 
assists in 2002, didn't start the game against 
CSULA, but he recorded an assist on each of 
UCSD's last two goals. 

"I was very pleased with his play today," 
Armstrong said. 

In goal for UCSD, senior Jeremy 
Cookson had to make just one save, while 
Gonzalez was forced to make four stops for 
Los Angeles. The home team took 15 shots 
in the game to the Eagles' nine. 

Although the Tritons found a way to take 
advantage of the CSULA's weaknesses, 
UCSD didn't take care of the ball, giving it 
away to CSULA while not capitalzing on 
some good goal-scoring opportunities. Two 
times late in the game, the Tritons earned 
breakaways where they only had to beat the 
goalie, but UCSD couldn 't score on either 
chance. 

"A good team doesn't do that," 
Armstrong said after the game. "Against a 
good team, we can't do that. We were able to 
get away with it tonight, but against a good 
tcam, wc'lI be punished." 

UCSD, which improved to 5-2 overall 
and 4-2 in the California ollegiate Athletic 
Association, continued itS home stand by fac-
ing the CCAA Central leaders C U 
Dominguez Hills two days later. Results of 
the game were unavailable at press time. 

The Tritons will next be in action 
against Chico State at Triton Soccer 
Stadium on Oct. 3 at 4:3 0 p.m., and then 
they will take on rival UC Davis on Oct. 5 
at 7 p.m.

Visiting No. 7 Bruins upset No. 5 Tritons 
UCSD men's water polo defeated 5-3 at Canyonview 

Rebecca Droier/Coordion 
lie riv.ls: For the first time ever, UCSD men's water polo was ranked higher than UCLA but the Tritons, who seemed a bit 
tense, could not overcome the Bruins in a 5-3 loss before 1,802 fans at Canyonview Pool on Sept. 26. 

Top ranked women's 
volleyball falls to rival 
No.3 CSUSB beats UCSD in five games 
By BRYCE WARWICK 

Senior Staff Writer 

The Tritons are likely to lose 
their No. I ranking this week after 
a depleted UCSD womens vol-
leyball team split two matches on 
the road , beating Cal Poly 
Pomona and losing to No. 3 Cal 
State San Bernardino in five 
games. 

Heading into the biggest road 
trip on the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association schedule, the 
Tritons received some bad news. 
Outside hitter Bonnie Wilson -
the UCSD's leader in kills and the 
CCAA Player of the Week for 
Sept. 15-21-wassidelinedfor3-
6 weeks with a stress fracture in 
her left foot. Additionally, 
Wilson's opposite Ashley 
Peterson went down with an ankle 
sprain that will hold her out of 

action for at least two weeks. 
Heading into Cal Poly 

Pomona without two of its six-
footers , UCSD struggled slightly 
at the net. The Tritons were out-
blocked 11-8 by the Broncos and 
UCSD surrendered a game to the 
heavy underdogs, but got the vic-
tory 3-1 (30-22,23-20,30-17,30-
26). 

Lindsay Crandell led the 
Tritons offensively with 18 kills, 
while Stacy Dunsmore con-
tributed 13 and Katie Hogan 
added 12 on just 19 attempts. 
Senior opposite Lauren Mills, 
whose playing time is li~ely to 
increase in Peterson's absence, 
stepped up and picked up a 
match-high 13 digs. Middle 
blocker Kendra Canape and etter 
Teresa Ohta also had strong 
matches for the Tritons, accumu-
lating 6 blocks and 50 assists, 

respectively. 
UCSD attacked at a solid .355 

clip as a team and picked up 51 
digs compared to Cal Poly 
Pomona's 34. 

The Sept. 27 match-up 
between the Tritons and the 
Coyotes of Cal State San 
Bernardino was hailed by both 
schools as the "Clash of the 
TItans," and it certainly lived up 
to its billing. PLaying in front of an 
above-average crowd in 
Coussoulis Arena where the 
Coyotes are 68-7 since the start of 
the 1998 season, the home side 
came out strong in game one, tak-
ing the Tritons 30-28. Despite 
recording just seven kills in game 
one, UCSD fought back to even 
the match at one apiece with a 30-
24 victory in game two. Not to be

After attaining the fifth posi-
tion in the NCAA national poll on 
Sept. 24, the UCSD men's water 
polo team seemed more poised 
than ever to finally do what no 
Triton polo squad has ever 
accompli hed : bring UCLA to its 
knees. 

Plagued by lackluster offensive 
play, the Triton could not make 
any dents in the armor of UCLNs 
dominance, falling to the seventh-
ranked Bruins 5-3 in front of 1,802 
fans at Canyonview Pool on Sept. 
26. 

The UCSD defense had double 
duty keeping the Tritons in the 
game, but without any contribu-
tions to the scoreboard, could not 
avoid a 5-1 deficit by the middle of 
the third quarter. 

From a team that has averaged 
7.8 goals a game this season 
against ranked opponents, 
UCSD's offensive output during 

the match was, at times, anemic. 
The Tritons drew 12 six-on-five 
man advantages throughout the 
match, only to capitalize on two 
of those attempts. 

"Our offense tonight aban-
doned us," said UCSD head coach 
Denny Harper after the match. 
"We were outdrawing the whole 
nation in ejections and when you 
only convert two man-ups the 
whole night, that's what costs you 
the game." 

Many times when the Triton 
carried po session of the ball, the 
tempo of play was somewhat hesi-
tant and tended to be more cau-
tious and defen ive, a situation that 
Harper felt was brought upon by 
the mind ets and pressures crea ted 
by newfound uccess in the rank-
ings. 

"When the rankings were 
announced, that was, I think, 
when the tension began and 
maybe some fear of failure caused
