Admissions study finds 
racial discrepancies 

Differences ~ot statistically 
significant, Brown says 

8y 8RYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

The UC Eligibility and 
Admissions Study Group released 
a study on March 8 showing that 
slight racial discrepancies existed 
in the current freshman class. The 
group found that in 2003, blacks 
and ChicanolLatinos were admit-
ted at a higher rate than predicted 
by a statistical model, while Asian 
Americans and whites were admit-
ted at slightly lower rates. 

The study was designed to 
determine .whether the University 
of California has been adhering to 
Proposition 209, which prohibit-
ed the university from considering 
race or ethnicity in admissions 
decisions. 

The largest differences were at 
UC Berkeley, where blacks were 
admitted at a rate 7.3 percent high-
er than predicted, ChicanolLatinos 
at a rate 3.2 percent higher than 
predicted, while Asian Americans 
and whites were respectively admit-
ted at rates 1.7 and 0.5 . percent 
lower than predicted. 

Differences at UCSD were 
less pronounced, with blacks and 
ChicanolLatinos respectively 
admitted at a rate 1.7 and 1.1 per-
cent higher than the predicted 
rate, and Asian Americans admit-
ted at a rate 0.8 percent higher 
than the model predicted. Whites 
were admitted at a rate 0.5 per-
cent higher than predicted. 

"I remain concerned about a 
few presently unexplained differ-
ences in admit rates of similar stu-
dents by race/ethnicity," UC 
President Robert C. Dynes said in 
a March 8 statement. "I am direct-
ing the Office of the President to 

. conduct further analyses on these 
disparities; if there remain prob-
lems, whether intentional or unin-
tentional, then I expect them to be 
corre(:ted by the campuses in time 
for the next admissions cycle." 

The report also analyzed the 
effects Proposition 209. has had 
on admissions. 

"The analysis demonstt:ates 
that since the implementation of

A.S. Council, GSA resolutions 
• support same--sex marriage 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council adopted a res-
oluti~n that opposes amending the 
U.S. Constitution to ban gay mar-
riage at their March 10 meeting. 
More than 50 people attended the 
meeting to show their support of 
the resolution, which passed by a 
vote of 17-2 with four abstentions. 

The legislation resolves that the 
A.S. Council "supports access to 
marriage for people regardless of 
gender identity, sexual orientation or 
biological sex" and urges representa-
tives at the state and federal level to 
oppose banning same-sex marriages.

Report claims 
'hidden costs' 
in travel deals 

By SHANNON EUor 
Staff Writer 

According to a report released 
by the Caljfornia Student Public 
Interest Research Group on March 
4, travel companies are engaging in 
deceptive marketing practices that 
increase the cost of spring break 
travel packages advertised to stu-
dents. The report estimates that 
students end up paying on average 
62 percent more than the advertised 
price for spring break vacations'. 

"Spring br6ak is supposed to be 
a chance for students to relax and 
recuperate," said Lindsey DeSalvo, 
internal chair of UCSD's CalPIRG 
chapter. "Instead, travel companies 
are using it as a chance to fleece 
students." 

Titled "Spring Broke: How To 
Avoid a Spring Break Ripoff," the 
report inspects travel advertisements 
in approximately a dozen communi-
ties around the country. Seventeen 
travel agencies were examined, com-
paring the actual price of a one-week 
spring break trip to Acapulco with 
the advertised price. 

Generally, the costs examined 
were fares for trips departing in 
mid-March and the per-person 
price for a four-person hotel room. 

CaiPIRG's report found that 
every advertisement contained hid-
den or misleading fees, which, 
mentioned only in fine print,

ment and equal rights," A.S. 
President Jeremy Paul Gallagher 
said. 

The resolution points out that 
marital status is taken into account 
in the formula used to determine 
financial aid. Also, the resolution 
cites the UCSD Principles of 
Community, which charge stu-
dents, faculty and staff to "confront 
and appropriately respond" to acts 
of discrimination based on sexual 
orientation. 

A.S. Student Affirmative Action 
Committee Representative Daniel 
Gonzales helped to author the res-
olution in response to requests he 
received from students. 

"In addjtion to giving support to 
the queer community on this cam-

pus, the resolution will also be a 
powerful tool in organizing and 
advocating on those issues," 
Gonzales said. 

The Graduate Student 
Association passed a similar resolu-
tion against a constitutional ban on 
same-sex marriage on March 8. 

"All discrimination affects us as 
students," GSA Vice President 
External Heather Flowe said. 
"These forms of discrimination 
being proposed on the federal level 
through this constitutional amend-
ment particularly impact a student' 
ability to secure housing, get insur-
ance and/or obtain financial aid, to 
name only a few effects."

A.S. backs UCSA on 
fee policy guidelines 

By MARNmE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

Members of A.S. Council 
passed a resolution by consensus 
during its March 10 meeting in 
support of a statement by the UC 
Student As.sociation that urges 
the university to maintain an 
open student fee policy that 
would allow student governments 
to use funds in campaigning on 
public policy issues. 

UCSM statement of princi-
ples was created in response to 
the university's efforts to revise its 
guidelines, the latest of which was 
first released Feb. 4, prohibiting 
student governments from fund-
ing "non-university political" 
campaigns using student fees. 
According to the University of 
California's proposed changes, 

campaigns for ballot initiatives 
are included in the restrictions. 

For A.S. Vice President 
External Harish Nandagopal, 
who submitted the legislation, 
supporting UCSA means allow-
ing students to have more control 
on how student fees are spent. 

"It's important to support the 
statement because it gives stu-
dents more autonomy over how 
to use their fees," Nandagopal 
said. "It will also give us more 
lobbying power when we lobby 
the state to pursue the education 
mission of the university." 

In addition to supporting the 
UCSA, the A.S. resolution states 
that the proposed changes would 
limit student governments "from 
engaging in political activities

I BRIEFLY 
Violation grievance filed in 
Warren Council eledions 
John Muir College freshman Michael Gollner 

has filed a violation report with the Earl Warren 
College Dean of Student Affairs Office on March 
9 alleging that Warren sophomore Harry Khanna 
has not submitted all matenals necessary to run 
for a position on the college's student council. 

The complaint accuses Khanna, a candidate 
for the Warren College Student Council presi-
dency, of violating a section of the college's 
elections bylaws that requires candidates to 
submit a ·signed copy of the Warren College 
Elections Bylaws and the ASUCSD Elections 
Bylaws signifyin~ adherence to the stated rules 
and regulations. 

Twenty of the total 21 candidates running 
for an elected position at Warren have not sub-
mitted the signed bylaws, instead turning in a 
form included in the college's election packet 
signifying that they had read and understood 
the bylaws, Earl Warren College elections man-

, ager Charlene Cheng said. However, all candi-
date packets were accepted by the elections 
committee as complete. 

The only candidate who did submil a signed 
copy of the bylaws was Warren freshman Erik 
Ward, who is running for WCSC president. 

Though regulations require that a grievance 
hearing be herd within three academic days, no 
date has yet been set, according to Cheng.

UCLA has announced that it is temporarily

The council approved a bylaws change 

that reduces the vote required to pull an

KP puts on 'Pilipino' week 
Events promote Filipino awareness 

By USA MAK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD lUibigang Pilipino 
organization lcicked off its annual 
Pilipino Awareness Week with a 
series of speakers, cultural activi-
ties and musical performances at 
Price Center Plaza on March 9. 
The organization will dedicate the 
week to highlighting Filipino cul-
ture and to raising awareness of 
issues affecting the Filipino com-
munity. 

In previous years, KP had 
organized a Pilipino Awareness 
Day, but since last year, the group 
has expanded its activities to cover 
a full week. 

"The goal of Pilipino 
Awareness Day and Week is to let 
people know that there is a 
Filipino community on campus 
and to make them aware of issues 
that are affecting . .. not just our 
community, but other communi-
ties of color as well," KP social 
awareness chair Charlene Pena 
said. 

According to KP vice-chair 
external Jonathan Lego, Filipinos 
currently constitute about 5 per-
ceOl of the UCSD student popula-
tion. 

This year's activities started 
with a speech from John Blanco, a 
UCSD literature professor, who 
addressed themes of cultural 
awareness and Filipino historical 
issues. Blanco emphasized investi-
gating cultural questions and 
accepting personal differences. 

"We study and · participate in 
the making of a community with 
the idea that it will teach us some-
thing about being Filipino or 
Filipino-American that we don't 

already know, and that this knowl-
edge is going to be useful .. . at 
least in finding new friends," 
Blanco said. "But the more we get 
to know one another, the more we 
realize how different we are, and 
how impossible it is to say that the 
philosophy of one friend is any-
thing like the philosophy of 
another, but that neither friend is 
either more or less 'pinoy' or 
'pinay' because of this." 

The professor concluded his 
talk with general remarks that 
transcended specific cultural 

groups. 
"Some of us wonder 

whether the larger question isn 't 
how to be Filipino-American, bur 
how to be human, in a world that, 
from the highest seat of the U.S. 
government on down, has gone 
quite mad," Blanco said. 

After Blanco's speech, KP aca-
demic director Noel Salunga pre-
sented his personal views on 
Filipino cultural awareness on 
campus.

Admin. professionals 
against unionization 

By MAlNETTE FEDERls 
Associate News Editor 

In an election that lasted from 
Feb. 11 to March 3, UC adminis-
trative professionals overwhelming-
ly voted against having union repre-
sentation through the University 
Professional and Technical 
Employees, a union that currently 
represents UC researchers, techni-
cal and health care 
workers. 

Over 5,000 

" 

employees and don't work beside 
UPTE-represented employees." 

Administrative professionals 
throughout the UC system were 
involved in promoting both sides of 
the issue. 

For systems administrator Andy 
Davies, who works with UCSD 
Auxiliary & Plam Services, though 
the result of the election also came 
as a surprise, the surprise was a 

good one. One rea-

programmers, ana-
lysts and adminis-
trative assistants 
voted against 
UPTE representa-
tion, while about 
2,000 were in 
favor. 

I was pleased with 
the outcome of the 
vote I though even 

son why he is against 
exclusive represen-
tation by UPTE is 
that there is less 
flexibility to work 
with management, 
which could also 
mean prolonging 
conflicts.

For some who helped with the 
"Vote Yes for UPTE" campaign, the 
results of the vote were also a sur-

would have provided a voice for 
administrative professionals.

Students rely on 
governments for ·advocacy 
T he use of mandatory student activities fees for student govern-
ment political activity has 
recently been cause for the 
UC Office of the President 
to introduce several chan~es 
to existing student fee policy. 
Questions arose in UCOP 
regarding the appropriate- · 
ness of such actiVlty after the 
Graduate Assembly at UC 
Berkeley funded a No on 
PropoSItion 54 campaign 
willi srudent fees in Octooer 
2003 . A draft of a revised 
srudent fee policy was sub-
mitted to each UC campus 
during fall quarter for com-
ment, and the University of 
California will finalize it in 
spring 2004. While the draft 
makes some improvements 
in the clarity of specific poli-
cies, it unduly restricts stu-
dent governments in several 
respects. 

UCOP claims that since 
student governments are 
"official units" of the univer-
si ty, they cannot use univer-
sity resources to fund politi-
cal activity. This claim 
neglects the role of student 
governments as representa-
tive bodies that must be 
afforded the right to lobby 
on behalf of students. 
Student governments, how-
ever, should lobby only for 
appropriate causes like 
proposition 54 that affect 
students and higher educa-
tion. 

The draft proposal cor-
rectly reinforces that funds 
from student fees be allocat-
ed to registered campus 
organizations on a viewpoint 
neutral basis, and that off-
campus activities and orga-
nizations be eligible for 
funding. It correctly ensures 
registered campus organiza-
tions the right to en~age in a 
broad range of actiVlties, and 
includes language that 
encourages fund allocation 
to hinge on such important 
factors as size and acovity -
not political viewpoint. Also 
acknowledged is the politi-
cally beneficial (if not educa-
tional) role of off-campus 
student activities and organi-
zations, like the UC Student 
Association, in advancing 
the interests of students. 

While UCOP's proposed 
restrictions on student gov-
ernment activity are unwar-
ranted, it has valid concerns 

for proposing the changes in 
the recent oraft. Allowing 
UC student governments to 
advocate - with resources 
provided by student fees -
on behalf of any ballot or 
candidates it deems neces-
sary implies that the student 
government is truly repre-
senting the best interests of 
its constituency. 

Accepting this as a truth 
- that the 1\.S. Council, for 
example, is representative of 
undergraduates because 27 
percent of the student body 
shows up to the polls once a 
year to elect their advocates 
- is to ignore the many 
flaws that have regularly 
been a part of UCSD ~li­
tics. The A.S. Cound is 
elected by a relatively small 
percentage of students that, 
by and large, know very little 
of the canoidates' stances or 
voting history. A more pow-
erful check needs to be held 
by constituents, forcing gov-
ernment leaders to be more 
accountable with their votes 
and their proposals to advo-
cate on behalf of external 
political . issues with student 
fee morues. 

In order to empower sru-
dents with an increased abil-
ity to make decisions, the 
AS. Council needs to reex-
amine (and refonn) the rela-
tionship it has with its con-
stituents. For example, the 
voting records of senators 
shoulo be available if they 
are running in a later elec-
tion. A stuoent voter has a 
better idea as to what the 
candidate stands for if he or 
she is able to examine how 
the candidate voted on a cer-
tain item. Exposing these 
voting records makes for a 
greater debate during the 
election season and nolds 
accountable the leaders who 
allocate student fees for their 
preferred events or projects. 

For a student government 
to accept the responsibility: 
of advocating on behalf of 
students, it must prove that 
it actually represents student 
interests by working toward 
a more involved and better 
educated electorate. While 
the A.S. Council and other 
student governments should 
be fightmg to maintain a 
voice of advocacy in external 
affairs, effort should also be 
put forth toward ensuring its 
legitimacy as a truly repre-
sentative authority. 

Passionate debate 
The Passion of the Christ' is not anti-

semitic. but rather encourages 
disaJssion of long-forgotten issues.

Pollution makes fishy 

finals week food 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to 
your article "Useful tips and 
tricks to eating healthy during 
finals" (March 8). One particular 
food that is popular during this 
finals period is fish, which is high 
in protein and low in fat and typ-
ically considered "brain food ." 
Fish is especially popular during 
winter finals because Lent is 
upon us, a season when many 
Catholics abstain from eating 
meat on Fridays and instead eat 
fish . Unfortunately, due to toxic 
mercury levels, federal and state 
heal th officials have issued warn-
ings for people to limit or avoid 
many types of fish. No one 
should ever have to worry for 
their health as a result of practic-
ing their religion, but because of 
mercury pollution from power 
plants, that's precisely what many 
Catholics will do this Lent. 

For years, the largest unregu-
lated source of mercury has been 
coal-fired power plants. Now, the 

" No one should ever MtJe to twrry far their 
health as a result of 

practicing their 
re~gion., but ... that's 
precisely «htt many 
Catholics will do tlUs 

Lent."

Bush administration has pro-
posed a plan that would allow six 
to seven times more mercury 
than would be allowed under the 

Clean Air Act. Despite the severe 
neurological and developmental 
delays that mer~ury causes for 
young children and fetuses, the 
Bush administration is failing to 
ensure that these plants use the 
best available pollution controls, 
which the Environmental 
Protection Ageney has said would 
result in a 90-percent reduction 
from current pollution levels. 
Obviously these children won't 
be doing too well on their finals 
in the future, despite the smart 
foods they are eating now. 

The Bush administration 
should protect the health of our 
children by dropping its proposal 
to increase limits on mercury pol-
lution from power plants and 
instead enforce the Clean Air 
Act's requirement that power 
plants install the best mercury 
pollution controls currently avail-
able.

Crocery labor agreement lets down workers 
Two-tier pay system sells' out future elllployees 

By KAJ ROIGA 
Staff Writer 

The end of the grocery workers 
strike has left a sour taste in the 
mouths of consumers. For five 
months they endured frustration at 
the supermarket - if not from the 
awkward feeling of walking 
through a picket line, then at least 
from the empty milk shelves. . 

To add salt to the wound, the 
bargaining process between United 
Food and Commercial Workers 
and representatives of Safeway Inc., 
Kroger Co. and A1bertsons Inc. 
exposed the grocery stores as ri gid 
in their negotiations and the strik-
ers' marketing efforts as mislead-
ing. In the end, consumers got a 
front-row seat to the gore-fest that 
is the American labor dispute. 

Part of the fault for the strikes 
length can be placed on the grocery 
store chains themselves. lndeed, if 
they had not been so steadfastly 
opposed to making concessions at 
the bargaining table, the strike 
would never have dragged on for 
nearly five months. This is evident in 
the similarities of the recent strike-
ending agreement to a proposal 
made by the grocery store chains in 
October 2003 . Furthermore, the 
chains' insistence on a two-tier·wage 
system in which new employees 
would be placed in a lower pay 
bracket sounds, to many, sinister. 

However, the grocery stores, to 
their credit, had a straightforw~rd 
stance ·concerning the lockout from 
the beginning. They sent a· clear 
message: We will not bargain. 
Though somewhat stubborn and 
deceptive (no one actually believed 
that they would go bankrupt with-

ou( a two-tier wage system), they 
were at least consistent. The unions 
involved in the strike, on the other 
hand, relied on a platform that was 
highly misleading in the message it 
sent to consumers and the media. 

When organizing the strike, 
union leaders were fully aware that 
the publics support was the most 
crucial element; if conswners did 
not care, neither would Safeway. 
Therefore, UFCW nationalized its 
cause. In the press, it proclaimed 
that the strike was a battle "to save 
affordable health care for .. . all of 
Americ,a s workers." 

Said one representative, "2004 
is the year to put health care reform 
on the political agenda." Another 
for AFL-CIO, which at one point 
took over strategic planning of the 
lockout, stated, "This strike is 
about defending health care cover-
age for all working people." 

Therefore, the 70,000 striking 
workers turned themselves into 
America's voice for protecting, and 
even begi nning the process of 
reforming (though in ambiguous 
terms), the health care system. A 
sympathetic public then turned 
away from their favorite grocery 
markets to show their support for 
the workers, expecting a landmark 
agreement to arise that would 
shape future policy concerning 
health care across the nation. 

In contrast to what the UFCW 
described as "a sacrifice for afford-
able family health care ... across the 
nation," the recent bargaining 
agreement reveals that the interests 
of only the 70,000 striking workers 
involved were brought to the bar-
gaining table. The contract 
expands new health care benefits to

only current employees, while rele-
gating new hires to a separate, 
"basic" plan. Furthermore, a two-
tier pay system will allot current 
workers higher wages than individ-
uals hired after Oct. 5, 2004, who 
would also face a longer raise 
schedule. 

Even after the strike ended, with 
press releases failing to mention the 
two-tier payment system, UFCW 
proclaimed, "The strike raised the 
alarm for national health care 
reform." 

Despite UFCW assertions that 
it had served the entire country's 
population of lower- and middle-

" . .. the interests of 
only the 70,(XX) 
striking workers 
involved were 
brought to the 

bargaining table. " 
class workers, it appears that the 
union's devoted members merely 
served their own interests. This, 
of course, is no crime in itself. But 
the workers misled the public 
when they claimed to represent a 
national struggle for all workers, 
only to reach an agreement that 
furthered their own interests at 
the direct expense of future 
employees. If the unions, which 
knew the grocery stores would 
hold to the two-tier system, had 

no intention of preventing this 
aspect of the agreement, they 
should have been more straight-
forward in the promises they 
made to the public when garner-
ing its support. At least that way, 
when the terms of the agreement 
had been made public, consumers 
would not have been left with the 
awkward feeling that they had 
been led on by the strikers' 
promises of fighting for all work-
ers. 

Despite UFCW cries of victory, 
this agreement is a failure for work-
ers across the country. Because 
future employees were left out of 
the deal, they will be left to fend for 
themselves through similar forms of 
collective action. The public, both 
tired of the inconvenience and 
remembering the difference 
between the platform of the 2003-
04 strikers and its contrast with the 
agreement eventually reached, will 
not be as susceptible to UFCW-Iike 
propaganda and will not support 
future strikes as strongly as it did 
those of the last five months. The 
current agreement not only lowers 
future employees' benefits, but also 
hinders their ability to increase 
them through collective action. 

Ironically, at the conclusion of 
this ordeal, the strikers and 
unions, accepting terms that 
doomed all future employees to 
worse conditions than those that 
had led them to strike, appear to 
have been driven by the same self-
ish motivations of which they 
accused their employers. 

The reality is that the American 
public was fooled into supporting a 
seemingly broad national cause, 
only to be left with an outcome that 

could not be more partial and 
exclusive. It was their own fault , 
however, as from day one they dis-
played immense na·ivety. 

An astounding characteristic of 
modern society that needs to be 
examined is its tendency to blindly 
support any group that claims to be 
"oppressed" by Corporate America. 
Consumers were na·ive and gullible 
in assuming that the aims of the 
strikers were broad and national. 
Instead, society needs to acknowl-
edge that individuals act in their 
own best self-interest and that no 
one holds an obligation to blindly 
support a group just because its 
claims appeal to one's emotions or 
preconceptions a bout workers (as 
the poor 'oppressed) and corpora-
tions (as the greedy oppressors). 

Perhaps the disturbing outcome 
of the grocery store strike can serve 
as a lesson for proper, responsible 
consumer behavior when such 
events arise in the future. 
Multibillion-dollar companies and 
large-scale unions will always lie . 
However, the consumer has a duty 
to filter out the noise in the infor-
mation provided to them and full y 
understand the issue at hand before 
siding with one party. 

The recent strike-ending agree-
ment was a mild success for the 
70,000 UFCW members, a pro-
found victory for the grocery store 
chains, and a travesty for future 
employers of Southern California 
grocery stores. In addition, it serves 
to show that consumers need to act 
more responsibly in supporting such 
movements and strikes and not act 
solely on stereotypes and presump-
tions about workers and corpora-
tions.

6Passion' movie inspires 
greater religious debate 

Calls for censorship ignore 
potential educational value 
Iy KEUY GILaEIT 

. Staff Writer 

There was no way "The 
Passion of the Christ" could 
escape becoming a must-see. A 
Catholic taking on a Story with 
definite potential for anti-
Semitism, Mel Gibson brought 
history's most famous crucifixion, 
the foundation of the Christian 
faith, into the theaters - what 
about the film doesn't scream con-
troversy? 

Gibson had difficulty even 
finding a producer, but loads of 
research, even more filming and a 
few political edits later, the film 
has set new records in ticket pre-
sales and has sold out theaters 
nationwide. On opening night 
March 3, the film's revenue was an 
impressive $26.3 million. It has 
generated far more than that in 
terms of debate and it has revisit-
ed an interesting question: Are 
religious subjects appropriate for 
the film industry to touch? 

Well, yes. Absolutely, definite-
ly, categorically so, and for several 
reasons . 

A single good, thought-pro-
voking movie that forces viewers 
to forget about the trans-fat in 
their popcorn and how much they 
just paid for a ticket and instead 
question their views about some-
thing that matters is worth ten 
million movies like "Eurotrip." 
(But then, what isn't?) Films, 
while entertaining, have the 
power to provoke thought - it's 
hard to deny the potential power 
of the medium in the interest of 
sweetly inoffensive entertainment. 

Assuming there is a great uni-
versal truth about God, there are 
also, by definition, going to be fal-
lacies therein. Consequently, 
there will be movies that perpetu-
ate them, movies that, depending 
on one's perspective, might border 
on the blasphemous, the overtly 
preachy or the sinfully agnostic. 
But such, it would seem, is life . 
There will never be a universally 
accepted belief about God, and a 
director has the right to express 
his own view. By that same token, 
(would-be) filmgoers reserve their 
right to avoid seeing the movie. 
Hopefully somewhere in the mid-
dle, the truth will make itself 
known. 

Meanwhile, however, it's 
ridiculous to censor every per-
spective that may be wrong. A 
God whose omnipresence or holi-
ness or power or love depended 
on our view of him would hardly 
be worth making any kind of a 
movie about. If God was weak 
enough to be changed and rede-
fined each time a film offered 
some new perspective on him, 
then why should we even worry 
about how we portray him, let 
alone whether to believe in him? 

If anything'S foolish, it's the 
idea that we shouldn't acknowl-
edge anything that has the power 
to offend. This is a nation where 
even pronouns must be carefully 
chosen to stay politically correct 
- it's impossible for any relevant 
topic to be inoffensive to every-
one, but that's no reason to avoid 
confrontation . An unchall~nged 
idea is a dangerous one, and blind 
belief in anything is an even more 
dangerous precedent to set. 

You wouldn't think so, though, 
based on the uproar that ensues 
whenever a film tries to push 
some undefined boundary, reli-
gious or otherwise. "Passion" def-
initely doesn't comprise a new 
genre - "Latter Days," for enm-
pIe, recently released in maybe 
five cities nationwide, has been 

blacklisted because it deals with a 
Mormon boy who is seduced by 
another man. A good segment of 
the more conservative Mormon 
population has fought this one -
but to what end? To try to say that 
there are no Mormons tempted by 
homosexuality? There's a critical 
difference between filming a topic 
and endorsing it, and people miss 
that point all too often. 

. This resembles what happened 
in 2002, when director Jimmy 
Bean won the Sundance Award for 
"The Believer," an exceptionally 
thought-provoking story about a 
volatile neo-Nazi named Danny 
who was also a closet Jew. "The 
Believer" made $) 57,487 in the . 
box offices, and Blockbusters tend 
to cairy one copy of it (if any); yet 
many people cried foul. The 
major criticism of "The Believer" 
was that the anti-Semitic argu-
ments the character of Dannv 
made were simply too. convincing. 

Yet, film is a safe way for the 
public to be exposed to such ideas, 
process th~m as intelligent view-
ers, and - in some cases - for-
mulate a stance. One could , of 
course, contend that even an idea 
negativel y portrayed in a film, 
such as ' Danny's neo-Nazism, can 
still influence people against the 
director's wishes (Complaints 
arose despite the fact that Bean 
ca lled "The Believer" "embarrass-
ingly philo-Semitic"). But if soci-
ety can be that easily swayed by 
any form of media, a film's con-
tent is the least of our problems. 

As with "The Believer," the 
most heated criticism of "Passion" 
is that it 's flagrantly anti-Semitic, 
but that argument is a weak one. 
The movie showed many Jews 
who registered the horror and 
compassion befitting of witness-
ing such a violent death (which, 
for the record, is far more than 
can be said about the Roman sol-
diers). And we must give Gibson 
some credit: It's hard to corne up 
with a flattering portrayal of a 
crowd of Pharisees crying for the 
crucifixion of any man, let alone 
one who loved humanity enough 
to sacrifice his own life . 

The larger problem with com-
plaining about the film's depiction 
of the Pharisees ' - or claiming 
that we shouldn't film things like 
gay Mormons, neo-Nazis, the 
graphic Violence inherent in thc 
crucifixion, or any sort of unpleas-
ant notion that might disturb peo-
ple - is that some Jews really did 
want Christ crucified. It's entirely 
legitimate to honestly film that 
historical truth, in the same way it 
is legitimate to film the white 
Americans who 'cruelly enslaved 
blacks and the Nazis who broke 
every moral code during the 
Holocaust. Yes. an audience is 
repulsed by such historical charac-
ters, as well it should be. But that 
does not mean that a previously 
unprejudiced viewer will assume 
that, because some Jews 2,000 
years ago were zealously inhu-
mane, all Jews everywhere are the 
same. To sugarcoat history is to 
lie. 

Our world is not a G-rated 
Disney movie, no matter how 
much we contest every disturbing 
subject matter treated in film . 
Marks on the past and similar 
contemporary issues will remain 
whether or not we use movies as 
an outlet to discuss and under-
stand them . Our questions about 
God will not go away if we deem 
them too controversial for 
Hollywood. 

If those who do not learn from 
history are doomed to repeat it, 
then those who deny it are simply 
doomed.

Senator Ashley A1uisi and Earl 
Warren College Junior Senator 
Everly Mariano were the only sen-

resolution. 

A1uisi expressed a need to repre-
sent the voice of students who are 
in favor of the constitutional 
amendment to ban same-sex mar-
riage even though it was a difficult 
decision for her to make. 

"I knew that this would be

that these people needed their 
voice, too. I was going to be their 
voice, as hard as it was for me." 

on this," Nandagopal said. "There's 
no such thing as political neutrality." 

After no debate on the council 
floor, Gonzales moved for a roll-call 
vote on the resolution. When the 
result was announced, the council 
and members of the public applaud-
ed and gave a standing ovation. 

"I think that any time the 
Associated Students can stand up 
against discrimination of a particu-
lar portion of the UCSD popula-
tion, we all benefit from it," AS. 
Finance Assistant Kirsten Bowen 
said after the resolution was passed. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Jake Gaidarenko came to the 
council meeting because it is his 
only point of influence as a non-
U.S. citizen, he said. 

"It's very important for me to 
see that the school actually backs 
me up," Gaidarenko said.

"Filipinos here at UCSD are

at Price Center after you eat. (and] 
also visible around the world mak-
ing the shins you wear off your 
back .. . so Filipinos are contribut-
ing to our everyday lives, little do 
you know," Salunga said. 

Musical performances for the 
day included Everything Is 
Andrew, a Mira Mesa-based punk 
band with mainly Filipino mem-
bers, and Mabuhay Rondalla, a 
San Diego-based string ensemble. 
The Mabuhay Rondalla aims to 
promote Filipino culture through 
performing a variety of music 
ranging from traditional folk 
songs to contemporary runes. 

"The musical performances 
were a good representation of our 

culture," Revelle College sopho-
more Manuel Sequerra said. 

Daniel Gonzalez, Student 
Mfirmative Action Committee 
representative to the A.S. Council, 
also gave a brief speech on univer-
sity access, focusing specifically on 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
proposed budget cuts. According 
to Gonzales, the issues of srudent 
fee increases and reductions in 
financial aid affect all student 
groups. 

The day's event concluded with 
a Filipino fashion show, in which 
KP members modeled traditional 
clothing and presented historical 
background on their attire. 

Overall, many members of KP 
felt that this first set of Filipino 
awareness activities went success-
fully. 

"I felt like [the day] went well 
because we were able to use the 
space we were given to express 

what we wanted and to share our 
culture," Pena said. 

In addition, KP also ran a 
weeklong campaign to raise 
money for the Madapdap 
Therapy Fund, which was started 
by a group of students from dif-
ferent UC campuses who studied 
abroad in the Philippines last 
summer. The students helped 
children living in contaminated 
areas in the Philippines suffering 
from various h~alth problems. 
Proceeds from the fundraiser will 
be used to transport children to 
physical ther:lpy sessions. 

As a conclusion to its cultural 
awareness week, KP will be host-
ing a Pilipina Appreciation 
Dinner on March 12 at the 
Cross-Cultural Center from 5 
p.m. to 8 p.m., during which 
Filipinos throughout the San 
Diego community will be recog-
nized. ' 

Mariano called these resolutions 
ineffective in general, saying they 
end up having few visible effects. 
Mariano also took issue with A.S. 
Council adopting an official posi-
tion on a topic that is controversial 
because a single position does not 
incorporate the views of all UCSD 
students. 

Srudents were joined by the 
director and assistant director of the 
LGBT Resource Center, both of 
whom appeared at the meeting to 
urge the council to adopt the resolu-
tion. Paul Harris, manager of the 
information desk at Geisel Library, 
also addressed the council during the 
public input portion of the meeting. 

President George W. Bush 
announced his support for a consti-
tutional amendment to ban gay mar-
riage last month in response to thou-
sands of same-sex marriages in San 
Francisco. The A.S. resolution 
specifically cites biUs HJ. Res. 56 
and SJ. Res . . 26, which must be 
approved by two-thirds of each 
house of Congress before the 
amendment can be submitted [0 the 
states.

"No one is asking you to like 
gays and lesbians," Harris said. "At 
some point, you need to ... realize 
that if you oppose this common 
sense resolution, you are denying 
other human beings who are very 
similar to yourself the same choices 
that you may enjoy." 

A.S. Vice President External 
Harish Nandagopal plans to start a 
campaign to alert lawmakers to the 
A.S. Council's position.

One clause in the A.S. resolu-
tion enumerates a host of organiza-
tions that will receive a copy of the 
resolution. The list ranges from 
local media organizations to law-
makers and the California and U.S.

"As students, historically we've 
been involved in some of the most 
critical movements in our century 
- the civil rights movement, 
divestment in South Africa because 
of apartheid ... " Gonzales said. 
"This is just the beginning."

Proposition 209, differences in the 
admission rates of similar students 
of different races and ethnicities 
have been reduced dramatically," 
the group stated in its report. 

Due to the small differences in 
the rates and limitations in the sta-
tistical model, the group cautioned 
that more sophisticated analysis was 
required to detennine whether race 
or ethnicity still plays a role in the 
admissions process. The study only 
took into account quantifiable data 
such as grade point average, stan-
dardi zed testing results and income 
level. The group is currently under-
talring a smdy at UC Berkeley that 
attempts to quantify and account 
for additional factors. The study 
also lacked information on the sta-

tistical significance of the results. 
"Even with this sophisticated 

methodology, it can be diffic:ult to 
tell whether there are real 
racial/ethnic effects on admissions 
decisions or imperfections in the 
statistical models," the group stated 
in the reports technical appendix. 
"All else being equal, small discrep-
ancies between a group's predicted 
and actual number of admitted stu-
dents could be due to the omission 
of relevant admissions criteria from 
the statistical model." 

UCSD Director of Admissions 
Mae W. Brown does not believe 
that the results are significant. 

"You don't see a statistical sig-
nificance when you really look at 
it because the numbers are so 
small," Brown said. "When you 

look at African-American [admits 
at UCSD) for 2003, you're look-
ing at a difference of 18 students 
in a pool of 3,800." 

Brown does not believe that 
any drastic changes in the admis-
sions process are necessary. 

"As I reflect on the admissions 
process, ( think that it is a very clear 
and transparent process," BrO"~l 
said. "The big picture is that clearly 
there will be students that we can-
not admit to all of our campuses. 
But I think, as professionals in this 
field of admissions, tha t those fol ks 
who are involved in the reading 
process possess high integrity."

Union: Large 
'no' vote 

surprises both 
sides of issue 

contin ued from page 3 
came to negotiating for our jobs ... 
the union would have represented 
our voice at the bargaining table." 

Others also agreed that union 
representation would create more 
complexities for the employees. 

"Union representation could 
potentially hinder rather than 
advance our careers, II said Alexis 
Raymond, who is a senior writer at 
the UC Davis Development Office 
and who created a flyer for the 
"Vote No" Web site. "It would pre-
sent another layer of bureaucratic 
hoops to jump through to get pro-
moted or reclassified." 

According to library assistant Bill 
Pfendeer, the results mean that he 
and his colleagues would not be able 
to benefit from pay raises. Pfendeer 
also stated that one of the reasons 
that many of his colleagues voted 
against Wlionization could include 
misleading infonnation. 

"Personally, I'm very di sa p-
pointed, and I had hoped to see a 
raise in pay, as it would affect my 
monthly reti rement income," 
Pfendeer said . "Three times during 
the quest for [admini strative pro-
fessionals'l unionization I found 
the university administrator 
spreading half-truths, making mis-
leading statements and telling out-
right lies." 

Some agreed that the lack of 
information about the UPTE could 
have contributed to the wide mar-
gin of votes against union represen-
tation. . 

"I think that it was just not get-
ting enough inforplation out," 
Conde said. "There was that Web 
site against it, and there was a lot of 
negativity. 1 think people believe 
what they see and read it as the 
gospel, and people don't have a lot 
of time to look up information for 
themselves ... 

Some say the recent conflict 
with the striking grocery workers 
could have also affected how 
employees voted. 

"When UC staffers saw the 
length of time unionized grocery 
workers were locked out and not 
receiving regular pay and benefits, I 
believe many UC administrative 
professionals were able to project 
themselves into that situation and 
did not feel ready 10 make the kind 
of sacrifice that ,an extended labor 
dispute may entail down the line," 
Davies said. 

However, supporters of UPTE 
representation have argued that the 
recent budget cuts are reason 
enough to become unionized. 

"Especially in this time of a 
tight budget, having a union is very 
important so we can help to talk to 
management about necessary and 
unnecessary layoffs," Buckmaster 
said. 

According to Davies, one issue 
with UPTE included having differ-
in&, jobs put together under one 
union. 

"Many different job classifica-
tions were lumped together by 
UPTE in their petition for exclusive 
representation," Davies said. "The 
sheer diversity of the jobs meant 
that many individtials with very dif-
ferent job responsibilities and needs 
were bei ng put together under one 
proposed bargaining unit." 

According to Buckmaster, 
UPTE will continue to assist those 
who supported them and work on 
issues that affect all UC employees. 

"We're going to continuc to 
work on issues such as pay and 
especially layoffs in important pro-
grams such as student outreach, 
and will continue to work especial-
ly with people who votcd for us and 
those we consider as su pporters," 
Buckmaster said. "I think once peo-
ple understand the benefits of 
being in a union, they will want to 
be part of it."

'Arte Latind exhibits 
art, culture and passion 

By VUMAI 
Staff Writer 

Hearing such an obvious name, one might assume that the 2004 San Diego Latino Film Fe~tival is pretty much nothing more 
than what it says it is: an event which features 
many Latino films. This festival is very sneaky, 
however, as it has bypassed the trite definitions 
for film festivals and has added this new ele-
ment (among others) - "Arte Latino." 

Exhibited at Madstone Theatres Hazard 
Center March 11 to March 21, SDLFF 2004's 
"Arte Latino" showcases the work of Alma 
Lopez, Jose Ramirez and Nuvia Guerra, three 
highly esteemed artists. 

Alma Lopez is most popularly known for 
her works with digital imaging that comments 
on racial, gender and sexuality issues in society. 
Her work has published in Art in America and 
Ms. Magazine. Lopez's art deals with issues of 
women in the modem world, a hint of contro-
versy and lots of attitude. What's not to like?

Shut up, world: HOlTors of

We're all familiar with the type. They are the annoyingly loud people who speak over 
the movie dialogue or, even worse, 
contribute to the dialogue or the

right in front of you even though 
they can see that you're short and 
there are plenty of othu- seats avail-

There seems to be a trend in 
the world as a whole, where self-

" 

couple sitting behind me kept talk-
ing through the final fi ght scene 
with the multiple Smiths. When I 
turned around to shush them, I got 
a dirty look as if I were the one 
doing something wrong. 

It's gotten to the point where 
people have gotten so comfortable 
being their self-absorbed selves 
that when they'r'e shushed they 
won't even get embarrassed and 
shut the hell up. Instead, they'll get 
insulted and talk even loudu-. This 
doesn't solve anything. 

The best is when the two peo-
ple begin discussing (in depth) the 
plot of the movie as it's happen-
ing. When I saw "Identity," the 
couple next to me discussed 
everything from the actors to the 
cinematography. "Oh, John 
Cusack's in this?" "Wow, I didn't 
know he was in this." "Well, I 
guess he is. Doh, it's that Ray 

Every time I go to 
the movies these 
days, there seems to 
be that one person 
who doesn't realize 
that you're sharing 
this experience with 
at least 20 or so 
other people. Hey, 
would you mind 
piping down? I 
don't enjoy getting 
out of my seat and 
missing what 's play-
ing on the screen in 
order to get the 
usher in the theater 
to shut you up.

from comparisons. Nevertheless,

Steele writes the music and plays 
most of the instruments on the

result is a narrow-minded record 
of Beatles retreads, surprisingly 
skimping on hooks in favor of 
aonospherics. 

"Good Dancers" opens the 
record promisingly enough with 

complement the soulful, dreamy, 
funk-inspired acoustics. The 
tracles on this album show a 
range of musical influences; 
Their first single from this 
album, "Home," featuring the 
beautiful vocals of Tina Dieo, is 
inspired by jaz.z., while the raspy 
voice of Sophie Barker in 
"Passing By" is accentuated with 
guitar work that puts a spin on 
Zero 7's music . It is perhaps their 
guitar-guided tracks ("When It 
Falls" and "In Time") which 

a simple, string-laden arrange-
ment, but Steele's able vocals and 
decent lyrics are curiously 
buried. It points to the problem 
of the rest of the record: exces-
sive layering. The individual 
parts of each song are buried 
under strings, choirs and multi-
tracked vocals aiming for that 
perfect Abbey ROlli or Pet Sounds 
quality, but fail in a misguided 
attempt to mimic some of the 
best songwriters of yesteryear.

'Sunshine' is spotlessly funny treat 
Rack up another victory for surrealist screenwriter.(harlie Kaufman 

By BILLY GIL 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

"E ternal Sunshine of the 
Sr.0tless Mind" is a flawed 
fi m. Some of the dialogue' 
just doesn't work, the 

characters are inconsistent, the 
acting can be awkward, and the 
film's ambitions overreach its 
means. But the joy of watching 
this extraordinary group of people 
try to make something grand ele-
vates what could have been (and 
sometimes is) a mess into some-
thing more than a film . It's an 
experience just to witness it. 

Screenwriter Charlie 
Kaufman created wildly innova-
tive scripts with " Being John 
Malkovich" and "Adaptation." 
This is his second collabora tion 
'with director Michel Gondry of 
White Stripes and Bjork video 
fame (the first was the mostly 
forgotten "Human Nature") . 
They don't so much hit the nail 
on the head as hammer around it, 
finding new ways of presenting 
famili ar themes. 

At its core, "Eternal 
Sunshine" is a love story. Jim 
Carrey plays Joel, a man so shy 
and subdued you ' ll completely 
forget he is being played by 
"Bruce Almighty." Carrey excels 
at the role, infusing Joel with 
heart underneath the stoic sur-
face . His foil comes in the form 
of the erratic , bohemian 
Clementine (a wild but tender 
Kate Winrlet). Their odd pairing 
is as unexpected as it is com-
pelling. The two characters 
bounce off each other perfect! y, 
butting heads and presenting as 
real a relationship as you'll see 
onscree n. Carrey and vVinslet 
perfectly portray the characters ' 
underlying vulnerabilities and 
love in spite of the difficulties 
they face . 

When their relationship with-
ers, Clementine has her memory of 
Joel erased from her mind. A frus-
trated Joel opts for the same opera-
tion but soon after reali zes he loves 
Clementine too much to lose his 
memories of her. Tom Wilkinson 
(of "In the Bedroom'') underplays 
his role as Dr.' Howard Mierzwaik, 
the man responsible for the opera-
tions. He and his team (Kirsten 
Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah 
Wood) scramble to ensure that the 
failing operation goes according to 
plan while their own stories inter-
rwine with those of the <;omatose 

Courtesy of Focus ratures

Joel. 

The film's innovative special 
effects, from showing memories 
vanish piece by piece to digitally 
disfigured faces of characters 
being erased from Joel's memory, 
are always remarkable. The scenes 
of memory-removal are often 
hilarious as Joel and Clementine 
run through Joel's buried chi ld-
hood memories when Joel is 
forced to relive his most embar-
rassing moments. 

Gondry uses digita l specia l 
effects in moderation, instead 
relying on such trickery as light 
refraction and making characters 
actually have to run around and 
play different versions of them-
selves within the same scene. 
You'd never know by watching it; 
it's usually smooth rather than 
clunky. But the end result of 
Gondry's deviousness comes 
through - the film maintains a 
manic energy that is entirely 
infectious. 

It doesn't matter that Kaufman 
reuses some ideas from his 
"Malkovich" script, namely that of 

Film 
REVIEW 

creating a window into another 
person's mind. The film bears little 
of the disrurbing tone of 
"Malkovich." Instead, it is a play-
ful-yet-emotional journey that 
never feels heavy or preachy. 
Kaufma n's fantastical ideas and 
Gondry's unconventional approach 
to filmmaking are entirely 
approachable without losing their 
trademark idiosyncrasies. Don't let 
the artsiness of "Eternal Sunshine" 
drive you away. A film this daring 
and Wlforgettable is a rarity.

about careers and making of 'Surishine' 

ByBIUY GIL 
Assodate HiatiJs Editor 

The cast of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" has such an unforced camaraderie 
that it's easy to see why the film is 
such a success. The players - Jim 
Carrey, Charlie Kaufman, Michel 
Gondry, Kate Winslet, Kirsten 
Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah 
Wood and Tom Wilkinson - sat 
to discuss the unorthodox 
approaches they took to make the 
film as well as answer personal 
questions about the individual 
choices they've made as actors and 
filmmakers . 

~: I've read about a cer-
tain technique used to get you guys 
to act in a certain way. You had to 
be surprised or confused on set .. . 

Jim Caney: What the hell are 
you talking about? We're profes-
sionals! 

Michel Gondry: I liked to 
make sure the cameras were always 
rolling. We didn't use a real tech-
nique. 

Carrey: Michel definitely flouts 
convention. At a certain point, he 
didn't want to say" Action!" or any-
thing. He just wanted to complete-
ly rewrite the whole rule-book and 
the cameras were rolling and Kate 
and I were like, " ... are we?" 

Kate Winslet: He would sti ll 
run the camera and I would stop 
talking in English and go back into 
American just in case. 

G: Is it true that the camera was 
once kept rolling all day? 

WInSlet: Ask the producers! 
GondIY: I think we shot more 

time than we were physically there. 
We had two cameras rolling and I 
guess one shot more than needed to 
be shot. 

G: Would you consider this 
movie kind of like "Lewis Carroll 
meets the movies?" 

Caney: "Alice in Wonderland," 
right. 

Tom Willrinson: In my humble 
opinion, it's in the honorable surre-
al tradition of "Alice and 
Wonderland" and "Through the 
Looking Glass." 

WInSlet: So much of what we 

ended up shooting was not only 
brilliantly written by Charlie but 
was in M.ichel's mind . Michel 
would be like, "now just do it com-
pletely emotional, let's just do 
something wild." Joel and 
Clementine's relationship, as 
Charlie had written it, is very real. 
It's actually a very simple love Story 
about two people who are really 
meant to be together in spite of this 
horrendous thing that they do. 

Carrey: It's romantic and yet it's 
not romanticized. It's a real love full 
of compromise and everything else 
that love comes with. 

G: If in fact the procedure was a 
reality, would you go through with 
it yourselves? What memories 
would you erase? 

Carrey: Probably the second-
to-last night of filming. 

GondlY: You mean the one 
where you were really nasty to me? 

Carny: Yeah. The one where 
you were a passive-aggressive genius. 

G: This movie is so bittersweet 
and surreal, what do you think will 
entice college students to go see it? 

Carrey: Spider-Man's girlfriend 
dancing in her underwear. 

Kirsten Dunst: Not just me 
[Ruffalo appears partially nude] . 

Carrey: He could take hi s 
clothes off at any time! 

G: (To Carrey) This,is probably 
the least over-the-top character 
you 've ever played. You really did-
n't have the ki nd of bombast and 
craziness of previous roles. 

Carrey: Fortunately Kate was 
really good at that. She was the 
outward manifestation of Joel 's 
insanity, the things he can 'I: express. 
For me, the special effect in this 
movie is the film. 

G: (fo Dunst and Wood) You 
both had success as child actors and 
now have taken projects and been 
fortunate in those choices. 

Dunst: I .love what I do. I've 
made wrong choices sometimes for 
the wrong reasons. It's not some-
thing I would do with my child. I 
just choose intuitively, it depends 
what I'm going through in my life. 

Elijah Wood: I'm the same. Just

Workshop: How to get rid of that screenplay 
cominued from page 9 

You're dirt-poor bur you've got a 
golden nugget of an independent 
film to produce? Don't fret; big 
names in Latino film are here to give 
some useful tips on financial issues 
and the film industry in the work-
shop "Financing the Independent 
Feature Film" on March 14. Come 
and take note of the things you real-
ly need to hear about survival in the 
big, bad world of filmmaking. The 
workshop offers the great voices of 
director/producer Antonio 
Chavarrias ("Nicotina"), executive 
producer Sergio Aguero ("Y Tu 
Mama Tambien.") and producer 
Diana Lezmez ("Empire"). 

The "Distributing and 
Marketing Your Film" workshop is 
on March 20. The marketplace is 
quite a jungle of competitive mad-
ness. Sometimes, 3S fabulous as it 

may be, your masterpiece may not 
have enough piquancy many films 
need to catch the public's eye. This 
workshop gives the amateur film-
makers practical information on 
entering the marketplace and shim-
mying into the minds of major dis-
tribution companies. Hear informa-
tion from the experiences of market-
ing expertise Ivette Rodriguez 
("Once Upon a TIme in Mexicoi 
and film division manager Julio 
Noriega ("Todo el Poder"). 

You may have written the next 
Oscar-winning script, but sadly this 
is a commercialized industry with 
glitz, glam and all that nonsense. On 
March 21, the feaUIred workshop 
"Selling Your Screenplay" will help 
you to sell a masterpiece. Hear 
screenwriter/actor Danny Mora 
("Dharma and Greg" and "Laverne 
and Shirley") speak from his own 

experience about the market for 
screenplays. With Mora's words of 
wisdom, gain bett~r insight into 
becoming more industry-savvy, and 
make a script suitable for the com-
mercial market and maybe even snag 
an agent while you're at it. 

All seminars/workshops will be 
held at Madstone Theaters Hazard 
Center screen six from 10 a.m to 
12:30 p.m. Each seminar/workshop 
costs $25 general admission and a 
lovely discounted $15 for students, 
seniors and AlVF/Media Arts 
Center San Diego members. Heres 
the hidden treasure behind it all : If 
you participate in three workshops, 
the fourth one will be free. Tickets 
can be purchased online at

Interview:. Simplicity key in singular film 
continued {rom PCJ&f! r 2 

wanted to be part of the film. It 
changes from film to film. 

G: (fo Gondry) Your approach 
to this film was very different to 
that of videos, which seems very 
precise and planned out. Can you 
compare that to malcing the film? 

Gondry: We didn't want 
explosions of effects or a show-off 
of technology. We thought that 
the memories should feel like the 
memories are vanishing physical-
ly, not just like a 'simple illusion. I 
try to be invisible as a director and 
let people e~st. 

Carrey: [Gondry's ideas) were 
always different, always challeng-' 
ing. I argued with him a couple 
times about how I didn 't think I 
could accomplish certain things. 
The scene in Lacuna where I'm in 
twO different places in the scene 
and I had to run behind the cam-
era ... 

Wmslet: We never thought it 
would work. 

Caney: I know, but Michel was 
like (affects a French accent] "Well 
why don't you try?" This is why the 
French discovered the hot air bal-
loon. 

WInSlet: (to Ruffalo) The part 
where you were in the closet .. . 

Mark Ruft'alo: He put me in a 
closet and then never let me come 
out. That was my part in it. 

Curey: (French accent) "And 
you go there in the closet." 

WalkinSon: This is a movie rJ1at 
is very cutting-edge, but in fact, the 
techniques we've described were 
how they used to make films. 

G: What was your reaction see-
ing the finished product? 

WInSlet: I knew that Michel 
had changed the order of things, 
but it completely freaked me out. 
The scenes shot at the beginning 
now come at the end. But at the 

end of the movie, I just thought, 
"God that just works." 

G: (fo Kaufman and Cartey) 
You are both known for comedic 
films, and this film is very funny in 
some places, but the focus is on the 
romance and the drama. How 
much of a pressure is there to be 
funny? 

Charlie Kaufman: When I was 
writing the film, I realized it wasn't 
coming out the way I had thought, 
but I was fine with it. There W2S no 
real pressure. 

Carrey: I don't feel it either. I 
get that question all the time 
because that's what you'd naturally 
think, that there's two different 
worlds going on at once, but there 
really isn't. For me, the story's the 
star. It doesn't matter if it's funny or 
not. Things come out of a chem-
istry with someone, but it's not a 
"yuckfest." You're looking for 
whats real about it.

'An Evening of Dance' explores astounding events, daily life, art 
Performances feature talent and collaboration from different members of UCSD's dance community 
8y JESSICA LONG 

Senior Staff Writer 

"A n Evening of Dance," 
directed by Yolande Snaith, 
combines the work of seven 
faculty members in the the-

atre and dance deparonent, several 
designers from the masters of fine 
artS program, and the dancing talent 
of over 60 undergraduate students to 
explore modern ideas of.dance. The 
collaboration of this diverse group of 
people results in an event comprised 
of seven distinct dance pieces, each 
with its own wlique style and mean-
ing. 

"[ndian Summer" is a dance cre-
ated by Allyson Green in response 
to paintings by George Inness. 
T his piece attempts to bring some 
of his paintings to ' li fe on stage 
while being accompanied by poetic 
text crea ted for the piece. 

Jean Isaacs re-staged "Sweet 
Jeff," a dance she made for her own 
company, for the show. The piece 
is a [ri bute to Jeff Buckley, the 
singer whose songs are the music 
for the work. [saacs feels that these 
pieces "capture the quality of his 
voice ... in four moods." 

OLD NAVY

Dance 
PREVIEW 

"Point of View," by Margaret 
Marshall, is the only dance in the 
show that could be considered "tra-
ditional ballet." However, this piece 

the end of it, and that she created 
this dance to "examine popular cul-
ture's multisensory multitasking 
through time and how we do not 
have much more of [time)." This is 
done not only through dance but 
music and video. 

Alison Dietterle Smith's dance 
"Inertia" is inspired "by the recent 
exploration of Mars and space." This 

moves away from 
the classical story 
ballet and instead is 
an "abstract inter-
pretation of move-
ment with music." 
Marshall considers 
this piece a visual 
experience with 
extensive collabora-
tion with lighting, 
costume and set 
designers. 

Patricia Rincon's 
postmodern piece 
"RushStop" is 
about how people 
today always run 
out of time. Rincon 

" [The choreographers} 
strive' to ... look 

toWard technology 
and other media to 

piece is a contempo-
rary ballet, blending 
the ideas and con-
cepts of modern 
dance and tradition-
al ballet. This 
choreography is 
presented against 
the backdrop of a 
video that Smith 
herself created and 

add new elements to edited. 
the , k " IT war . 

- Leith SchInfein. 
stuaent dancer 

"Chiaroscuro" 
is a term for light 
and shade in art or 
nature and is the 
title of Snaith 's 

said that she was interested in how 
people would rush through the day 
just to have a few minutes to relax at 

work. This abstract 
dance-theatre piece 

is the "exploration of light and 
darkness both externally and 
[through] inner feelings of light 

and dark within a theatrical land-
scape." 

Terry Wilson's work, "Seeing 
Through," deals "with loss and 
the isolation loss can sometimes 
produce." Wuson drew upon her 
own experiences, but allowed the 
cast to be involved in the choreo-
graphic process. Wilson wanted 
to make this dance because "mod-
ern dance expresses and com-
ments; it communicates and it 
heals." 

One of the most striking fea-
tures of this show is the use of 
other forms of art that might 
appeal to the viewer. As Leigh 
Schanfein, a dancer in both Smith 
and Green's pieces, says, "[The 
choreographers) strive not only to 
create art or deliver a message 
through dance, but they also 
increasingly look toward technolo-
gy and other media to add new ele-
ments to their work."

son to the movie with you. 
On that note, what's with peo-

ple talking to the movie screen) You 
know, yelling when the big-breast-
ed girl runs away from the knife-
wielding psychotic killer really 
won't affect the plot. Because if she 
did escape from the killer, there 
would be no movie and you'd be 
bitching about the fact that the 
movie had no plot. . 

Good. Now, shut it. 
While we're at it, would peo-

ple mind turning off their 
phones' The nice little animated 
features before the movie telling 
us that silence is golden aren't up 
there for kicks. I don't want to 
hear any cell phone go off in the 
middle of the film, and I definite-
ly don't want to hear anyone talk 
to whomever Calls during the film. 
No excuses. Is the wife pregnant 
and about to go into labor? Then 
why are you sitting in a movie? 
Worried about the roommate's 
crappy college car that has broken 
down? Tell her ·to get AAA. 
Seriously, no excuses, people. If 
it's that important, just put the 
damn thing on vibrate and then 
leave the theater to take the call' 
Why is this so hard? People don't 
tolerate it when someone answers 
his or her phone during class, so 
why should I tolerate it at the 
movies? 

I really don't know what's gotten 
into the world today. It used to be 
that you could go to a movie, get a 
bag of popcorn and a Colre, sit back 
and enjoy the cinematic beauties on 
the silver screen. Now, it seems that 
one has to come prepared with 
earplugs, duct tape and a multitude 
of "Shut it, bitch" looks in order to 
sit through the joy that is "Dirty 
Dancing: Havana Nights." 

I, along with everyone else in 
the theater, really don't care what 
you think of the hottie currently 
on the screen. Nor do we care 
about your pedicure issues or how 
lame it is that Terrell Owens got 
traded to the Ravens. Save your 
conversations, thoughts and 
beliefs for .fur the movie. Tell it 
to someone who cares, because 
the rest of us in the audience sure 
as hell don't.

Break: CalPIRG examines travel packages 
continued from page r 

totaled an average of up to S367. 
Those fees take form as departure 
taxes, processing fees, peak-week 
surcharges, late booking fees, 
departure city surcharges, cancella-
tion charges, or travel insurance. 
Although none seem like a drastic 
increase when taken alone, 
CalPIRG says, the cumulative 
effect of such charges is substantial. 

The largest percentage increase 
occurred when planning trips 
through Paradise Parties, whose total 
price of SI,016 was a l04-percent 
markup of the advertised $499. 
Conversely, the smallest percentage 
increase was linked to Student 
Express, whose advertised price of 
$449 was increased by 33 percent to 
get an actual price of $598. 

STA Travel, a global student 
travel company with a branch 
located in Price Center, was found 
by CalPIRG to have a 42-percent 
increase over the advertised price, 
costing consumers $947 versus the 
advertised $669. 

"nus is the first time it's been 
raised ro our anention," STA Travel 
UCSD bralJch manager Michael 
Medina said. "We never hide any-
thing, and it's always told to the client 
up front. We're here for the long 
haul - we're not here overnight to 
make the quick buck and move on." 

STA Travel spring break flyers 

included print noting that prices 
were subject to availability, do not 
include taxes, and advise students 
to contact local STA agents for 
details. Medina said that this is 
standard for all their advertising, 
and that students make use of the 
agency's advisers to help work out 
the pricing details. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Ryan Makhani had a mixed 
reaction to his 2003 spring break 
trip to Cabo San Lucas, which he 
booked through STA Travel. He 
said he paid as much as he had 
expected, but was disappointed with 
the location of his hotel. 

"The only thing that was kind of 
bad was that our hotel was next to a 
small city and we had to pay for a 
cab ride 20 minutes into down-
town," Makhani said. 

According to CaIPIRG, in addi-
tion to added costs, companies also 
require that travelers sign contracts 
that limit or relinquish certain legal 
rights, particularly the ability to file 
disputes with the travel company. 
Travel companies also reserve the 
right to alter travel and accommo-
dation plans at their discretion. 

The report suggests ways stu-
dents can avoid having to end up 
paying more than they anticipated. 

"We urge students not to get 
. distracted by the teaser price you 

see on a poster or flyer," DeSalvo 

said. "Be sure to find out about all 
of the hidden fees that come with 
each package, and shop around for 
the best deal." 

CalPIRG claims that the most 
important step students must take is 
to read all fine print and examine 
policies of the travel agency in ques-
tion before sending any money. In 
addition, the report urges students. 
not to overlook the invoice, but to 
read it and understand the purpose 
and amount of each fee. 

CaIPIRG also recommends 
avoiding any company that man-
dates students to give up legal rights. 
If there is a dispute, CalPIRG urges 
complaints to be filed through the 
Anomey General's office not only to 
reach a resolution, but to prevent 
the same experience from happen-
ing to future travelers. 

Before sending money, the report 
states, students should research the 
company they wish to use, and be 
cognizant of cancellation policies. 

"A lot of companies don't even 
put the fine print on the flyers and 
don't give it to you unless you 
specifically ask for it," said Cindy 
Dunn, CalPIRG chapter co-chair. 

The report also urges travel 
agencies to list any potential fees or 
base price increases in readable 
type next to base price listings.

·Current university revisions to 
the policy would not allow funding 
to be allocated to student organiza-
tions and programs by means of 
campus ·'referenda . According to 
Nandagopal, a referendum allows 
students to find out more about 
where money is allocated. 

"Right now, when A.S. passes a

that we want to put this much

could not do that," Nandagopal

In a statement released in 
February, the UC Office of the 
President argues that the proposed 
changes were made in order to 
comply with California law restrict-
ing public agencies, including the 
university, from using public funds 
"to promote a partisan position in a 
state election campaign."

"I don't think it's right for A.S. 

or the university to favor a particu-
lar proposition - if they are will-
ing to fund a proposition, then 
they should also equally fund 
another proposition," Revelle 
College Sophomore Senator 
Ashley Aluisi said. 

Student organizations were 
given until March 26 for input and 
comments on the proposed revi-
sions. The UCSA statement, 
which includes guidelines for 
appropriate student fee policie , 
will then be submitted to UCOP. 
The A.S. resolution will be for -
warded to UCOP along with 
ASUCSD comments on the

THURSDAY, MARCH II, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Men's tennis: Doubles teams improving 
continued from page 24 

team, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
The Tritons continued to struggle 
in doubles, losing two of three 
matches, giving the Mustangs the 
doubles point for the day. At No.2, 
senior Arnir Nejad and junior 
Bryan Swan fell to john Nguyen 
and Brett Van Linge, 8-5, while 
senior Nick Morton and Molden 
lost to Davey Jones and Stacy 
Meronoff, 8-2. Seniors Sameer 
Chopra and jeff WJlson teamed up 
to defeat Matt Baca and Nick 
Tracy, 9-7, at No. I doubles. 

"Our movement in doubles is 
something that we are going to 
have to work on, and something 
that we will improve at," 
Steidlmayer said. "But right now. 
we are just not looking to be 
aggressive enough." 

Knowing it had a tough battle 
ahead in singles, UCSD attacked 
early on, taking the first set in five 
of the six matches. At No.2 singles, 
Swan quickly ended the day for his 
counterpart, Van Unge, in straight 
sets, 6·0,6-1. The Mustangs coun-
tered by taking No.6, as Meronoff 
gOt the best of Nejad, 6-3, 6-3 . 
Shortly after, Chopra took the win 
in No. I singles. After losing the 
first set to John Nguyen, 6-1 , 
Chopra found his rhythm and 
secured the win with identical 
scores of 6-3 in the second and 
third set. 

With UCSD and Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo tied 2-2 in the match, 
it came down to No. 3, No.4 and 
No. 5 singles, which were all in 
the third set. At No.3, Wilson lost 
to Baca, whoJ11 he defeated in dou-
bles earlier, 6-7, 6-4, 6-1. But 
junior Emil Novak and Molden ' 
iced the match for the Tritons by 
winning their respective third sets. 
Tied at a set apiece, Molden and 
Tracy battled it out in the third 
with Molden taking the win, 6-1, 
4-6, 6-4. The deciding match 
came down to Novak, who, 
according to Steidlmayer, "fought 
a very loud and abrasive crowd as 
well as a tough opponent Dones) 
to seal the dual match." The final 
score for Novak's match was 6-3, 
3-6, 6-3. 

UCSD returned home to face 
Florida Gulf Coast, ranked 13th in 
Division II, on March 9. 

Mter struggling in doubles in 
their previous two matches, the 
Tritons stepped up and . notched 
big wins in doubles, taking an 
early 3 -0 lead over the Eagles in 
front of a boisterous crowd. 
Chopra and Wilson easily slid 
past their No. I doubles oppo-
nents Wolfgang Pinther and Jose 
Pastrello, 8-1. Shortly after, 
Molden and Morton took care of 
Richard Stempnowoski and 
Franco Mata, 8-5. The last dou-
bles match was at No. 2 with 

·Nejad and Swatt, who staged a 
dramatic comeback against Seth 
Fogelman and Nestor Nunez. 
Nejad and Swatt were facing 
defeat at 7-4, but scraped their 
way back into the match, holding 
serve and breaking back. The duo 
forced a tiebreaker and at 6-6, 
Swatt hit a forehand pass for a 
winner. At match point on serve, 
he fired an ace to eal the victory 
at 9-8 (8-6). The crowd went wild 
and Swart and Nejad bumped 
chests to celebrate their victory. 
Their big win was a momentum 
setter, as the Tritons went into 
singles with energy and confi-
dence. 

UCSD continued its strong 
play, winning four of six singles 
matches and icing the dual match 
at 7-2 over Florida Gulf Coast. 
Feeding off of the doubles win, 
Nejad and Swan finished their sin-
gles matches, quiclcly defeating 
their opponents in straight sets. 

Novak followed with a win in 
straight sets while Chopra mount-
ed his own comeback after drop-
ping the first set and being down in 
the second. 

"The match 9f the day was 
Sameer Chopra's," Steidl mayer 
said: "[He) dropped the first set, 
and then got down a break, 2-1, in 
the second before tUrning on the 
afterburners, winning 10 straight 
games and the match in three sets. 
Our players were making refer-
ences to Agassi the way Sameer 
was dominating points with his 
forehand. I was shaking my head 
and very happy he was on our 
side." 

The Trit~ns are looking to 
continue playing solid tennis 
because their schedule only gets 
tougher. On March II they face 
Rollins College, a team that has 
twice earned victories against top-
10 Division II schools, and 
Hawaii Pacific, the top-ranked 
school in the narion, on March 
12. Both matches are at 
Northview Tennis Courts, and 
first serve is at 2 p.m. on March 
II and 3 p.m. on March 12 . 
Steidlmayer feels good about his 
team's chances. 

"We definitely feel confident 
going into the matches," he said. 
"Today's team was No. 13 in the 
country, so I don't think we are 
going to be scared a~ all. I am hope-
ful that we improve mentally 
throughout all those tough match-
es. If we do, we are definitely going 
to win our fair share. It should be 
fun."

ly isn't anything to be intimidated 
by. We are going to enjoy every 
minute of it, but at the same time 
we don't want to be complacent 
just making playoffs. We want to 
prove to people that we are wor-
thy of being one of the teams 
selected, and we want to make 
sure we give our absolute best 

effort while we are there." 
Making the tournament will 

extend the .:areers of the two 
seniors on the team. Ginn, who 
recently broke the record for all-
time leading scorer at UCSD, and 
forward Robyn Phillips will have at 
least one more game in a Triton 
uniform. Everyone will be looking 
to them for leadership, but the 
entire bench is expected to con-
tribute. 

"In order for us to do some 
damage, we need everyone to step 
it up," Ginn said. "It is going to be 
our 28th game, so by now everyone 
is experienced and is expected to 
step up instead of relying on just a 
few players. We need a total team 
effort to win." 

When asked about facing the 
No. I team in the country, Ginn 
said, "It's fun to be the under-
dog!"

22 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Women's crew trails SDSU, USD 
.UCSD makes strong lightweights debut 

8y MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's crew 
team performed well on March 7 
at the California Lightweights 
competition at Mission Bay 
despite facing stiff competition 
from the University of San Diego 
and San Diego State. 

The varsity eight competition 
saw USD in the lead, timing in at 
7 minutes, 28 seconds and SDSU 
taking second by crossing the line 
in 7:35 .5, while UCSD, timing in 
at 7:48, managed to capture third 
place. 

"The varsity came off with San 
Diego State, staying with them 
the first 1,000 meters, while 
understroking them," UCSD head 
coach Patti Pinkerton said. 

UCSD's varsity team saw a 
shuffling of its stroke in the com-
petition. Since the team was miss-
ing its usual stroke, senior Tess 
Kornfield, sophomore Lauren 
Ruiz, who stroked the winning 
varsity four last week, stepped in 
to stroke the lightweight crew. 

"I was very pleased about this,~ 
Pinkerton said. "Many of 
[SDSU's] lightweights arc from 
last year's undefeated lightweight 
crew. We are still early in our 
5peedwork, 50 we'll be bringing 
the rating up." 

T he varsity crew made its 
lightweight debut in the match. 
T he boat was comprised of 
coxswain Phoebe Lee, Ruiz, Mel 
IUelberer, Dannon Hodge and 
Ariana Pilram, all sophomores, as 
well as seniors Liz Jones and 
Chelsea Smith. The multi -talent-
ed Pilram doubles as a rower. 

The varsity women were 
joined by novice freshmen rowers 
Megan Hagquist, the novice cap-
rain, and Audrey Koniges. 

"[Hagquist and Koniges] had 
only rowed with us in that lineup 
twice, and they did an excellent 
job of adapting," Jones said. 

UCSD also entered a novice 
eight team, which took a 
respectable second place. USD 
was first, timing in at 8:12, while 
UCSD closely followed, crossing 
the line in 8: 17. 

"The novice lightweights lost 
a length off the start, but came 
back at USD by the 1,000-meter 
mark stroked by Shannon 
Sapper," Pinkerton said. "They 
rowed a really gutsy race, pulling 
back to USD, only to lose a 
length when USD took the rat-
ing up for the final sprint. Our 
novices raised the rating, but we 
'haven't trained at that rate, so' 
[they] aren't quite as comfort-
able." 

The meet was an excellent 
learning experience for the 
Tritons. 

"It was our first lightweight 
event of the season, and I feel like 
we learned a lot from it," Jones 
said. 

However, UCSD was not the 
only newcomer to the complexi-
ties of lightweight competition. 

"USD was the surprise per-
former," Pinkerton said. "They 
have not raced lightweights in the 
past. " 

USD did have heavier women 
than what is usually allowed at 
lightweight crew competitions, 
but there were no weigh-ins. 
Lightweight crews are generally 
comprised of athletes that weigh 
under 130 pounds, but since the 
season is still early, coaches do 
permit a "winter weight" of up to 
135 pounds. 

Nonetheless, USD's learning 
curve was notable, consistently 
pushing past the competition, 
while UCSD tried its best to 
speed up and catch USD. 

"In both the varsity and the 
novice lightweight eights, USD ' 
came out of the blocks at a much 
higher stroke rating, gaining a 
length ri ght off the start," 
Pinkerton said. 

To prepare for the meet, the 
coach moved the crews into light-
weight boats, pulling them out of 
the other boats, and did drill work 
and speedwork to get them mov-
ing together. 

"In sports like this, racing is 
all about seeing how much far-
ther you can push yourself after 
your body has already told you to 
stop because it hurts, so a lot of 
our preparation is mental," Jones 
said. 

For UCSD, the California 
Lightweights competition · was a 
prime opportunity to judge its 
lightweight speed, but the meet 
was unusual for the Tritons. 

"When we race against most 
schools, they don't have light-
weights, so the' lightweights are 
mixed in with the first and second 
boats," 'Pinkerton said. 

UCSD's lightweights will be 
racing eights at the San Diego 
Crew Classic, the San Diego City 
Championships and the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Champ-
ionships. 

Pinkerton further remarked 
about the possibility that UCSD 
will double the lightweight con-
tingent into fours at the 
Northwestern Collegiate Rowing 
Championships after they race in 
the open varsity events. 

"The big thing abou~ this race 
is that it gives us some data when 
we decide which events to target 
for the WIRA Championships," 
Pinlc:enon said. 

The Tritons will next be racing 
Long Beadt State on March 14, 
which is traditionally one of the 
more competitive races for the 
Tritons. 

"We ar" still underrating the 
Southern California crews, so 
that might be an issue," 
Pinkerton said. "We expect them 
to come out of the start a little 
faster, but if we maintain our 
poise, I believe we will be very 
competitive . " 

Golf: Team flourishes . under difficult conditions 
continued from page 24 

and St. Mary's, which is ranked 
sixth nationally. Vou have to be 
able to go low, but also realize that 
75 can be a good score on a tough 
course." 

"We finished 16-2 for the 
tournament, which was just great, 
and helps solidify our chances for 
the national championships," 
Wydra said 

UCSD's B team put together a 
solid showing, and despite being 
many of the player'S first tourna-
ment of the year, they turned in a 
score of 946, or 96 over par. This 
score was enough to give them a 
15th-place finish , but they were 
not officially listed in the field of 
18 teams. 

Individually, UCSD was once 
again led by A team member 
junior Brian Duckworth, who fin-
ished in sole possession of sixth 
pl ace, his fourth consecutive to p-
10 finish. Duckworth started off 
March 8 with a score of 69, which 
left him in a three-way tie for sec-
ond place. His 69 was one of only 
five scores to break par on the 
early March 8 round, and one of 
only eight round tota ls to break ' 
par in the whole tourn ament. 
Duckworth struggled in the late 
March 8 round, shooti ng 77, but 
returned on March 9 with a 73, to 
give him a total of 2 19, or six over 
par. 

Leading the B team and com-
ing in second overall for the 
Tritons was sophomore Ryo 
Yamada, who put in rounds of 74, 
77 and 74. He fini hed with a 

score of 225, 12 over par, which 
gave him a tie for 13th place over-
all. 

"Ryo has a type of game that is 
particularly suited to this course, 
and he really caught our atten-
tion," Wydra said. "His perfor-
mance was an automatic qualifier 
to travel with us to our next tour-
nament." 

A team member and team cap-
tain senior Alan Scheer came in 
third overall for UCSD, with 
round totals of 73 , 76 and 77. His 
226 gave him a 13 over par, and a 
tie for 16th place. 

Sophomore Justin Grant was 
the third A team member, and 
fourth overall Triton, with scores 
of 23,78 and 76. Finishing with a 
227 , 14 over par, he tied for 18th 
place. 

"[This course] was definitely 
the hardest we have played all 
yea r, and it showed when top 
Division II teams in the nation 
like Bakersfield and Weste rn 
Washington struggled," G rant 
said. "The course definitely 
brought out the best players and 
teams in Division II , so to have a 
solid finish is good. But I think 
we all felt that we could have 
done better. It would have been 
great to win our own tourna-
ment, and we know that we could 
have if we had played just a little 
bit better." 

Junior A team member Joe 
Dolby came in fifth for UCSD, 
netting rounds of 80, 76 and 73 . 
WIth a 229, 16 over par, he tied 
for 28th place overall. 

The A team was rounded out 
by sophomore Robbie Kramer, 
who started off parring his first 
round on March 8 with a 71. Two 
consecutive 81 '5, however, earned 
him a 233, 20 over par, and a tie 
for 45th. 

"We have managed to have the 
low round of the tournament 
almost every time we go out, but 
have not been able to pull off a 
victory," Kramer said. "Once we 
can put a few solid rounds togeth-
er we will start winning. This is 
certainly within reach though, in 
light of how well we've been play-
ing lately." 

Finishing second on the B 
team was junior J an Godoski, who 
had rounds of 76, 77 and 85. 
Ending with a 238, 25 over par, he 
earned a tie for 62nd place. 

Coming in third for the B 
team, and eighth overall for 
UCSD, was junior Eugene Itkin, 
who turned in rounds of 80, 78 
and 84 for a 242, 29 over par. He 
tied for 74th place with fellow 
Triton and B team member Greg 
Wilson , a junior, who had rounds 
of 80,81 and 81. 

Rounding out the B team and 
the Triton squad was freshman 
Danny Min, who shot rounds of 
84, 80 and 87 . With a total of 
251,38 over par, he tied for 85th 
place.

shortcomings critical in losses 

continued from page 24 
been very disappointing to many of 
the playen looking to get back on 
the winning track. 

Freshman setter Brooles 
Dierdorff had 50 assists in the 
match, senior middle hitter Kevin 
Keyser had nine total blocks, and 
Waller had 19 kills to lead the 
Tritons. 

Two days later, UCSD returned 
to the court against No. 5 
Pepperdine. Coming into the 
match, the Tritons had never 
defeated the Waves in MPSF play, 
and Pepperdine had no intention of 
dirtying their perfect record 
against UCSD. 

A 15-8 run to open the match 
gave the Waves all the cushion they 
would need to grab the first game 
by a final score of 30-21. 
Pepperdine out-hit UCSD .259-
.067 in game one - numbers both 

teams would significantly improve 
upon in game two. 

The second frame was a pic-
ture of offensive efficiency as the 
Waves put down 16 kills with just 
four errors, but the Tritons 
topped even that wi th 17 kills and 
just one error for a .593 attacking 
percentage. Waller's six kills 
paced UCSD to a 30-22 win to 
even the match. 

The Triton bid for an upset was 
short-lived, since. games three and 
four returned to traditional form 
with Pepperdine winning 30-21 
and 30-24 to take the match by hit-
ting .680 and .531 in the final two 
frames, respectively 

Waller had 20 kills and 
Dierdorff topped 50 assists for the 
second straight match with 52.

Tennis falls to Emory for 
third loss of 2004 season 

Women's' singles cannot muster 
a win; doubles finish 2-1

The UCSD women's tennis 

team dropped its third match of the 
season to the 2003 NCAA Division 
III national champions, Emory 
University, on March 8. The 7-2 
loss brings the Tritons' overall sea-
son record to 8-3 with only eight 
more matches left in the season. 

The Tritons began the match 
with some hard-fought doubles 
matches. UCSD's only two wins 
came from the doubles lineup.

match by winning the next two 
sets, 6-4, 6-2.

Unfortunately, the Tritons were 
unable to add any more points to 
the scoreboard in the singles match-
es. Emory swept the entire singles 
lineup, giving the Eagles the final 7-

The Tritons have been playing 
back-to-back matches and will face

"The girls are . getting tired 
because they've been playing so

"They've been playing a lot of long

with the heat, it's been draining on

UCSD drops 

matches to USC, 
Pepperdine for 

fifth straight loss 

Lori Drahota/Guordian 
Burning out: No. 15 UCSD has won 
only two of its eleven matches since 
January. 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The optimism that wa pre ent 
\ hen o. 15 SO opened its 
Mountain Paci fi c Sports 
Fed ration chedule with a victory 
over on Jan. 17 wa nowhere 
to be found in the opening to the 
econd half of the eason, as the 

Tritons dropped consecutive 3-1 
matches at home to USC and 
Pepp reline on March 4 and March 
6, respectively. UC D has now 
dropped five straight matches, 
bringing the Tritol)s to 6-13 overall 
and 2- 11 in the MPSF. 

After beating U in both of 
their mo t recent meetings dating 
through last March, UCSD had 
reason to be confident on its 
home floor, and the Tritons dis-
played that confidence in game 
one. Trailing 24-20, UCSD 
resiliently grabbed the next four 
points to level the game. The 
teams traded point until the 
Tritons were able to go on a 
three-point spurt and go up 29-
26. With thei r backs against the 
wall, the Trojans fought off the 
first two game points, but after 
UCSD head coach Ron Larsen 
called a timeou t, hi team came 
back on the court and ca lmly 
closed out the game on a kill by 
senior opposite Jim Waller. . 

Game two displayed a Triton 
squad that appeared completely in 
control , as C D marched to a 19-
·14Iead. However, midway through 
the game, the tone of the match 
changed significantly, and the 
Trojans grabbed momentum that 
they would not relinquish. With a 
key five-point run propelling U C, 
game two went to the Trojans and 
the match was tied at one game 
apiece. 

Game three was tight early, but 
USC showed poise down the 
stretch and pushed the game out of 
reach to seize control with a 30-24 
win. Game four was never close, 
and a deflated Triton quad was 
beaten oundly, 30-20.

the match, which appeared to have

Men's tennis aces four straight opponents 
Tritons bounce back from loss to Loyola Marymount for mree road wins 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Sports Editor 
H ow a team reacts a fter a 

tough loss is often a measure of its 
strength. After suffering a disap: 
pointing loss to Loyola 
Marymount on March 3, the 
UCSD men's tennis team proved 
its strength and self-discipline by 
winning four straight matches, 
including three road matches in a 
day and a half. 

"J was pleased that we kept our 
consistent training after [March 
3)," UCSD head coach Eric 

teidlmayer said. "Most impor-
tant, we knew we needed to be 
tougher and we responded." 

The team's last two matches 
were · key victories agai nst 
California Collegiate thletic 

Association rival Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo and No. 13 Florida 
Gulf Coast on March 7 and March 
9, respectively. 

The Tritons notched a victory 
on the morning of March 6 
against Sonoma State, 9-0, and 
also defeated University of 
Nevada-Reno later that afternoon 
in San Luis Obispo, Calif. 

In the match against Sonoma 
State, the Tritons played solidly, 
taking all three doubles matches 
and all six singles matches. 

"A couple of players stepped in 
and played really well for us," 
Steidlmayer said. "[Freshman) . 
Seth pector and [enior] Sean 
Higginbotham filled the five and 
six spots [in . singles] and really 
went after it, defeating both their 
opponents in straight ets." 

Shortly after its victory, UCSD 
took the courts to face Division I 
Nevada-Reno. No.2 and No.3 
doubles were up one break, but 
the Wolf Pack .fought back to win 
both matches to take the doubles 
point for the day. 

The loss in doubles did not 
deter the Tritons, as they took five 
of the six singles matches. Down a 
set, sophomore Brent Molden had 
his back against the wall but bat-
tled it out with his opponent, forc-
ing a tiebreaker in the second set. 
Molden went on to win the 
tiebreaker and third set. Molden's 
win contributed to the Tritons' 5-
2 victory over the Wolf Pack. 

The last match of the road trip 
was against another Division 1

ticipate in the tournament, and 
UCSD was on the bubble for the 
eighth pot in the West for mo t 
of the end of the eason. 

T his is the first time since 
being moved from Division ill 
to Division U in the 2000-01 
season that the Tritons have 
made the tournament. C D 
made five Divi ion III appear-
ances overall. 

Senior guard Ali Ginn spoke 
of the accomplishment. 

"We are thrilled about mak-
ing the playoffs since it has been 
a goal of ours since we have made 
the transjtion to Division n," she 
said. "Playoffs have been a moti-
vating factor for us all year long, 
and it is an important step in tak-
ing our program to the next 
level." 

UCSD will face the nation-
ally o. I-ranked Seattle 
Paci fic in the first round of the

Stepping it up: The Tritons head to Seattle to take on the No. 1 Falcons on 
March 12 in their opening game of the NcAA Division II tournament. 

UCSD lost its first game of 
the eason to Seattle Pacific by a 
core of 89-57. The Tritons have 

an all-time 0-2 record agajnst the 
Falcons. Seattle Pacific has put 
together a very impressjve sea-

47- 1 in their past 48 games at 
home. This is the second season 
in a row that Seattle Pacific is the 
top seed in the West, which 
means that it has had home court 

.advantage in the tournament the 
past two years. 

The Tritons know that they 
are up against a very good team, 
but are not intimated ~y the 
Falcons and their experience. 

"It is not really intimidating

Golf takes 
third in field 
of 18 teams 
Duckworth has 
fourth straight 
top-10 finish 

By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team bosled 
the 54th outhern California 
Intercollegiate Championship 
held at the Santaluz Club in Del 
Mar, Calif. on March 8 and Marcl . 
9. 

The Tritons entered both an A 
and B team, with the A team plac-
ing third among the 18 competing 
schools. For the first time in the 
tournament's history, the compet-
ing teams were all Division n, 
including UCSD, currently ranked 
fourth nationally, according to 
GolJstat.com. 

"The course was really drying 
out for the second round on 
[March 8], and we made the pins 
even more diffiCQlt for the final 
round, which accounts for average 
scores of 78 in the last twO 
rounds," head coach Mike Wydra 
said. 

Coming out of the starting 
gates, the Tritons' A team began 
the tournament with a round total 
of 286, which not only put them in 
first place after one round, but was 
also the lowest round of the com-
petition. Unfortunately, UCSD 
had a little difficulty in the second 
round on March 8, scoring a 307. 
Coming back on March 9 with a 
299, the A team finished with a 
score of 892, or 40 over par, and 
third place in the tournament. 

The only schools to defeat 
UCSD in the tournament were 
No. 1 Cal State Chico and No.7 
Cal State Stanislaus. Chico shot 
rounds of 290, 301 and 288, to 
give them a total score of 879, or 
27 over par. Cal State Stanislaus 
finished with scores of 287, 297 
and 299 for an 883 on the tourna-
ment, 31 over par. 

"The course played exactly how 
I wanted it to," Wydra said. "A lot 
of teams are used to shooting low, 
and when they have a difficult 
course like this, they tend to give 
up. Teams like Bakersfield especial-
ly struggled for this reason, and it 
was great to beat Bakersfield, 
which is ranked second nationally,
