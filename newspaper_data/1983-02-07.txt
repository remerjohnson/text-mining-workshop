Letters to the Editor 

Challenge toJohnson 
Editor: 

In repyling to Mr. James H. 
Johnson's "An Open Letter to 
the Campus Religious Affairs 
Office," I would like to make 
the following points: 

Consulting the University 
library's card catalogue will 
amply refute Mr. Johnson's 
statements that" ... there is 
practicall y no information 
criticizing t he Bible or 
religiou books ... Serious 
thinkers and researchers find 
the Bible unworthy of belief." 

lhe Bible. 
Spea kers presented to the 

University by the Office of 
Religious Affairs are expected 
to be open to questioning and 
to c h al lenge from the 
audience. In the past. such 
cha llenge has been vigorous 
and. I am sure, wi ll cont inue to 
be so. We certainly invite Mr. 
John on's participation. 

Finally, if Mr . Johnson 
wishes to presenl a speaker or 
speakers on matters pertain· 
ing to religion. the Office of 
Religious Affair~ will be most 
happy to be of assistance to 
him.

Standard reference works 
on the Bible and related 
material respond to Mr . 
J ohnso n ' objections to 
specific bibli cal passage . 
T hey" do this, not from any 
particular religious viewpoint. 
but from the perspective of a 
schola rl y and scientific 
endeavour. M~.Johnson seems 

~naware of the variety of 
ltterary genre represented in

Editor: 

Maybe I'm just not I he type 
of person who is capable of 
appreciating contemporary 
art. or maybe I'm j4st 
con.ervative about the 
appearance or my school. 

Man~ people would say that 
art IS II1tended to make a 
statement. .. well I'm making a 
statement of my own. I 
consider the ne"v "Sun God" 
an unsightly Impingement on 
our prelly campus. It seems to 
me that thiS 'art' is designed to 
attract attention not through 
beauty but rather gaudiness. I 
hope other students will speak 
out against sim ilar works 
which will likely grace our 
campus in I he near future.

An open letter to J ames II . 
Johnson. 

Faith in God surpasses all 
human reason and under· 
standing. The foundation of 
that faith for some is the Bib\('. 
for others it is the Koran and 
still for others it is the T~rah. 
Just because I have a belief in 
God and the Bible does not 
mean that I am not a serious 
person or a freethinker. It does 
not mean that I am a child 111 
grammar school. [I slmpl) 
means that I have accepted 
God as m)' Crea tor and t ha t I 
try as best as I can to spread 
His lovE' and His CO 111 pa '..slOn to 
my fellow human being::,. Love 
and faith are not unreasonable 
things. Mr. Johnson. I strongly 
believe that they offer the on l\' 
hop.e for human kind. "

"Joy and sorrow are one." -

Igor Stravinsky in his eulogy 
for John F. Kennedy. 

Amy stands on the edge of 
Tioga Hall. galing out at the 
land . the sky. the light of the 
sun. The wind blows through 
her hair. Its pressure against 
her balance. Her feet feel the 
cement building below. She 
steps forward. 

Seconds later. Amy's life is 
over. Her material existence is 
gone. And yet Amy lives on. 

Love - for as I search the 
sea of despairing eyes, if I find 
by one sma ll token of my life. 
~(Jmeone else's is enriched. 
made better by my love. then 
my despairing eyes find one 
small token of wealth. 

[ love you, Amy; you set me 
free. Though you yourself 
were not free when you flew 
away, your despair found no 
peace. but your life it; no 
escape. 

No letters on editorial a bOll t 
a river at UCSD for shame 

by JAM ES RALPH PAPP 
Staff Wnlcr 

The opinion section in most 
of our recent issues has been 
filled with letters to the editor 
aboul Scott Young's article 
"It Wa~ a Very Bad Year .. .i 
Guess." You may be 
wondering why ~uch an 
inoffensive a nd ra ther well 
written piece has been getting 
so much attention. After 
rig 0 r.o u;, I n ve s t I gat I ve 
reportmg (I don't know why 
they keep putti ng me in the 

Feature~ section), I have 
uncovered the answer. It is 
merely pan of a wide'iprcad 
effort to draw attention away 
from my ~itorial support mg 
the bu tldll1g of a river at 

UC ' D. 
The 'iheer enormit} of thiS 

plot wa,> not at once clear to 
me. r left the newsroom the 
day I had written It. kno\\lng 
that I might be discovered tht' 
next morning bllidgeonc-d by a 
surfboard. I knew that 
headlines on the order of 
"Reporter Assaulted by Angry 
Crowd, College Co l llrnni~'t 
Jailed." or. in the ca~e of the 
Natiolla l Ellfj ll i)'cl'. "PrJ ncess 
Di Killing )lapp With Voodoo" 
were likely. This would be an 
un popula r pi{'c{'. a nel I he 
intcres t{'d partir'> would 
already ha\c got wmd of it 
when I failed to (O\er up my

Nothing happened. No 
footstep" followed mine. 
stopping when mine s topped . 
The po"tman delivered no 
threatening letter". Neighbors 
commented on the abs 'nee of 

brick ~ being thrown I hrough 
my wll1dows. I had covered my 
t racks after all ! 

But then tht' da\ of 
publication dawned. ot' to 1)(' 
II1timldated. I showed upat all 
Ill> class~s, although when 
they saw the Guardiall my 
professors werr su re t () a II gi ve

I love you, Amy, because in 
my lif~ my love is my only joy.

believe in you. Amy. I struggle 
on that ledge. and love IS all 
I've got to keep me from going 
over. 

And if in some person 
somehwere, some small 
burden is lifted, some light lit . 
then Amy lives on. 

As Neil Youn~ says in 
" Human Highway' : 

" I come down from the 
misty mountain. 

I got lost on the human 
highway 

Take my head refreshing

Take my eyes from what

change my mind ' 

How could people be so

By BARBARA HOPKINS 

PMS. Premenstrual Svn-
drome, IS a hormonal 
Imbalance affecting women at 
the end uf their menstrual 
cyele. An estimated forty 
percent of women expertence 
some symptoms and ten 
per c e n t () f the s e h a \. e 
symptoms serious enough to 
disrupt their personal and 
professional lives. AI! hough 
most women do not ha\ e all 
the symptom .... they can 
II1clude: 

- tension 
- depre'ision 
- anxiety or panic attacks 
- irritability 
- crying for no reason 
- fatigue, diZ7iness. and 
fainting 

- - forgetfulness or mental 
confusion 
- clumsiness 
- craving for sweets. 
carbohydrates. salty foods 
or alcohol 

cycle. One woman descnbes 
feelingolll of conlrol and "as if 
something was drall1ing out" 
of her. while at other times she 
is "O.K." Although severi ty 
\'anes each month. symptoms 
tend to won .. en wil h age. Oral

can relieve water retent ion

deepening distrust 111 those 

who determine this nation's 
course is still not discus~ed.

held on the lower patio of the 
Ma nde\'ille Center on Revelle

party shortly before 10 pm 
Even by thi ' time some were

take effect. 

Although identifcation was 
checked before one could 
obtain alcohol. It was easy

Plus/Minus Grades 
at UCSD??? 

The San Diego Division of the Academic 
Senate will meet in February to vote on a 
proposal for plus/ minus grading. Thedecision 
was originally to be made at their January 
meeting. It was delayed in order to inform 
undergraduates about the proposal and to 
solicit their opinions. 

The proposal calls for 'A', 'B', and 'C' grades 
to be further differentiated by adding-plus and 
minus categories to each. 'D' and 'F' grades are 
not included for modification in the proposal. 
With the exception of 'At' grades, all 
plus/minus grades will be calculated into the 
grade point average as three tenths of a point 
greater or less than the basegrade. Thus a 'B.' is 
counted as a 3.3, an 'A-' as 3.7, and so on. 

Your s~udent representatives to the Senate 
committees that have considered the proposal 
have already had their say. Now it's your turn. 
If you have a point to make about the proposal,

In a su rvey of residents at

they had dri\en after hea\\'

Part of the problem is with 

freshmen who, away from

Another problem IS the

Many at UCSD address questions on 
alcohol a-buse in wake of Fogcutters 

Consutner Corner 
By BELORIA OR NELLE 

If you are a renter, you may qualify for a Renters' Rebate -
even if you rented during the school year and returned home for 
the summer, or, if you had no taxable income and are not filmg a 
return. And you may file for each prevIOus four tax years in 
which you were a qualified renter. 

continued from page 8 
Teresa Smallberg, an RAon 

Muir College, notes the 
difference bet ween abuse of 
alcohol and irresponsible use 
of alcohol; two differen t 
things. "Students defin ite ly do 
drink. And they get drunk , and 
they get sick from getting 
drunk . But most learn their 
limits." 

Jeff Bass, Larry Montali , 
and Mary Rose Alexander , also 
resident advisors at Mu ir, 
agree that most stud ents 
quickly learn their limita tions. 
As Jeff put it , "There's no 
question that there is 
widespread use, a nd on 
occasion, abuse of alcohol. But 

AS meets: 

the dormitories are a hving 
si t ua tion t hat is new to 
most. .. At the beginning, yuu 
do see a lot of abuse of alcohol 
among students, but after a 
while their bodies te ll them 
when to quit. I wouldn 't call it 
a problem - it 's just a phaseof 
life that students go through, 
part of the personal learning 
process." 

The subject of alcohol abuse 
arouses many different 
viewpoints. What is alcohol 
a buse to one person may not be 
abuse to another, although 
most agree that when alcohol 
begins to interfere wi th one's 
life or becomes a burden to 
one's elf or friends, it is being 

abu~ed. 
While some seem to feel that 

alcohol is bemg abused at 
lJCSD, and others see nocause 
for concern, the general 
consensus is that alcohol 
misuse (rather than abuse) 
exisls, and that even those 
who misuse alcohol do so 
infrequently and eventually 
learn their limitations. 

chool is , after all, a 
learning experience -
students can grow personally. 

a~ well as intellectually . 
Coping with alcohol is perhaps 
a ~ifficult subject to learn . but 
in the opinion of most, the 
majority of students at UCSD 
are mastering their ABC s. 

To be eligIble for the Renters' Rebate you must meet these 
requirements: 
- You must have been a resident and renting m Californta on 
March 1.1982; 
- Your dwelling must not have been tax exempt (i.e owned by a 
charity such as a church); and, 
-You must not have received the Homeowners Property fax 
exemption. 

You can receIve the Renters' CredIt even though you receIve 
food stamps, AFDC, Medl·Cal, General AssIstance, TItle XX 
Services, etc. 

A refund of $60 for :;mgle person:;. and $137 for marned 
couple:; filing jomtly IS available for all renters who qualify. 

If you would like more information regarding the Renter~' 
Rebate CALPIRG will have a table on the Revelle Plaza February 
7·11, from 11 :30 - I :30. Pamphlets and tax forms will be 
available. 

No quoruOl so no voting possible, only debate 
continued from pitge 5 
that he wanted expansIOn to 
"stay close to the Student 
Center's existing structure 
because of its centra li zed 
location." 

Suggestions have been made 
to build a nother Student 
Center in the vicinity of 
Warren College in an effort to 
plan for the future growth of 
the university . 

One of the proposals for the 
new Student Center included 
expa nding the kitchen facility 
at the Pub to create a 
"shopping mall" type of 
restaurant atmosphere . 
Currently, several ideas are 

being thrown about , but 
nothing i definite. 

The Ta k Force did agree, 
however, tliat, " Mor e 
discussion of what students 
want is needed." On 
Thursday, Feb. 10th , the Task 
Force hopes to resolve this 
problem by having a meeting 
from 4to 5:30pm, tenatively at 
the Pub, open to all students 
concerned with the future of 
the Student Center and 
interested in voicing their 
opinions. 

Fight back with AS 
The AS apparently ha" nol 

given up its fight against the 

$100 fee increase scheduled for 
next quarter by Governor 
George Deukmejian. The AS' 
action so far this quarter 
includes the Anti·Fee Hike 
Rally, Political Action Week, 
and a postcard drive. 

This time, the AS IS 
tenatively upporting a 
proposed UC·wide-boycott of 
classes on February 16th. The 
boycot t IS a "show of 
solidarit y," says Steve 
Friedman, a Muir College 
representatIve to the AS 
Council. 

Friedman was not alone In 
hi~ stance. Other members 
abo contributed opinions and 

stres ed the need to denounce 
the $100 fee increase. 

At the present time, the AS 
is trying to validate a "one 
time-only" fee Increase, but It 
is hampered by the fact that In 
the la t lew years, It has 
become a cliche . LIsa 
Stenmark, AS external affaIrs 
officer, recalled that the "one-
lime-only" fee Increase has 
been used five times since she 
has been at lIeS[) 

Is a plus a plus? 
Mark eecof. frum the 

AcademIC enate, elaborated 
on the pros and cons of 

plus. minus grading The issue 
IS scheduled to come up at the 
next Academic Senate 
meeting, and before that time 
he plans to "take a poll to see 
what students think ." 

30 seconds 
Adam Forest resigned as the 

TGIF programmer due to 
confltctlng philosoph Ie.., 
between himself and the AS 
Counctl over the whereabouts 
of the Jan. 28th TG (the quad 
or Warren Collegel. tudents 
who are Interested In 
assuming the respon~lbtlitle~ 
of this volunteer office should 
contact the AS.

make the task of allocating 
$6,62 m ill ion even more 
difficult , To make the task 
even more arduous, Watson 
has told the Reg Fee to target 
for no more than $300,000 in 
increases, and only four new 
FTE, 

Reg Fee uses a two·step 
budget process when deciding 
allocations, First, it hears 
recommendations from the 
investigating dyad and 
representati ve from each 
department. Then the 
committee votes on how much 
each service is to receive. 

However, all funds approved 
this quarter are only tentative 
until the second step of the 
process is complet.ed , In spring 
quarter, Reg Fee will review 
all budget allocation and 
make final adjustments to 
reach overall budget goals and 
consideration . In this la t

instil ution of a new Legal 
Clinic at UCSD. The concept is 
patterned after the Legal 
Clinic at SDSU, and it 
represenl s the culmination of 
four year's work by Reg Fee 
Committees here at UCSD. 

our clinic!" 
At the center of the 

controvers y is Ray Dye. 
assistant vice chancellor, who 
was granted the authority by 
Watson on September 13, 
1982, to work with Reg Fee in 
the installation of the clinic. 

Dye was asked to comment 
on these charge and concerns 
voiced by Reg Fee Represent· 
ative . But he would not 
respond to any of the e, except 
to say, "No comment." 

Ray Levins, the Western 

Hatten's announcement 
concerning th opening of the 
new clinic came as a hock to 
many Reg Fee members, She 
stated that, "Its a big 
disappointment. We didn't get 
what we wanled at all, we got 
Western State," 

Dye came under fire by Reg 
Fee members last year who 
were con.cerned that Dye's 
pubhc biases against the 
concept of a legal clinic would 
effect the final outcome if he 
were involved in the planning. 

Students face real world 
After a lengthy and 

confusing battle over how the 
Jaw cllmc would be instituted , 
Western State University of 
Law has been awarded the 
contract for UCSD. 

Many Reg Fee members 
expres ed their concern that 
they have been misled by the 
adminis tration , AccO! ding to 
Keen , this deci sion "is a 
tremendou s insult. " 

Keen explained that the 
committee had been consider· 
ing awarding the contract to 
either USD or Cal Western 
University , stating that. "At 
our last formal meeting with 
Ray Oye It was agreed that l.al 
Western would be the clinic," 

Keen continued, ''I'm rather 
surp'rised that a school that 
has never been considered in 
the committee's discussions, 
all of a udden, a new school, IS 

Hatten tated that there 
were three factors which 
allowed UCSD to end up with 
~estern State: "Ignorance, 
Incompetence, and mi com· 
munlcatlOn .' · 

McDaniel added that, "I feel 
that , as a Reg Fee represent· 
ative . the communication 
process between Ray Dye and 
Reg Fee ha s not been 
acceptable . " 

Blame for mismanagement 
has also been attributed to the 
University Purchasing Office. 

f\ccorolng t o Hatten , 
"Purchas ing sent ou t the 
wrong contract. They didn't 
know the difference between 
'Cal Western' and 'Western 
State'. " 

Keen further stated that , 
"You can 't blame one without 
the other (Dye and Purchas·

but I don 't know if my major is 
the one I want." 

Many students have said 
that Lhey would like to stay at 
UCSD for a couple of more 
years before venturing into the 
job market. 

Although 1983 may not be a 
prime time for employment, 
according to Neil Murray, 
director of Career Planning 
and Placement, there are jobs 
out there, many of which , 
about 80%, are unadverti sed . 
The other 20% <those in the 
want ad s) appeal mostly to 
a ccountant s , co mputer 
analysts and engineers , 

"By far , the greates t 
opportunities lie in the 
technological fields, but there 
is no reason to switch majors,"

student can have success in 
the job market if he/ she 
decides on a career goal before 
he / she graduates, get s 
experience either through 
internships, part· time jobs, 
volunteer work or class 
projects, learns how to sell

The most important of these 
is getting experience, which 
can be gained through the

If the student is prepared for

A word on Bosworth Jumbles 
By JAMES RALPH PAPP 

Staff Writer 
L<lst night I recei ved a large 

package from UPS, alt hough I 
wasn't there at the time. The 
story of my life is never being 
there when somet h i ng 
exciting happens to me. 
Anyway, amongst the masses 
of crumpled paper whIch the 
box contained was a madeleine 
plaque, imported at great 
expense from France. 

Madeleine are little cakes 
which Marcel Proust used to 
write about, and although I do 
not like Proust I do like 
madeleines. They are flavored 
with the minimum of vanilla; 
in fact they don't have very 
much taste at all. When the 
French make something 
which hasn't verY much taste 
to it they make it in an 
intere ting hape. in this case, 
a hell shape. When the 
British. on the other hand. 
make something flavorles , 
which is pretty well all the 
time. they give it character 
with a funny name, like priddy 
oggies with scrumpy sauce (I 
kid you not ). 

Once. having been loanea a 
cookbok celebrating the 
cuisine of England, which I 
took in as a charitabl e 
contribution to endangered 
species, I felt the urge to make 
omething called Bosworth 

jumbles. How could one resist 
making something called 
Boswo rth jumbles ? The 
ancient legend behind them is 
that the\" \\ere Richard Ill's 
favorite cookie (or biscuit. as 
the Poms would say). and that 
th e three disasters of 
Bosworth FIeld were RIChard 
losing his crown. hIS life. and. 
flr"t and possIbly pre(ipita' 

ting his cook losing the 
jumbles recipe. At any <'nnt, it 
occured to me that the recipe 
was not requiring any 
ingredients which would tend 
to add flavor. but I had a vague 
faith that things \\ould turn 
out alright in the end. 

The timer rang. s ignaling 
that the jumbles had stopped 
jumbling. l took them from the 
oven. put them on a plate, and 
took a triumphant bite from 
olle of the piping hot (why 
should hot things pipe?) 
Bosworths . On the first 
sensation there was no flavor. 
I munched, and then got inlo 
some more serious c hewing, 
and st ill I could wring out no 
taste. Then, lelling them cool. 
I took a bite to see if they were 
any better cold , but there wa~ , 
even after a few of them. no 
hinl of va riation. I devoured 
the entire batch. si nce no one 
else would eat more than one, 
and as the ' hades of night 
approached noting more than 
a vague feeling, and only a 
feeling, mind you. of flour 
peeked through the window of 
my sensat ions. 

Madeleines. however, have a 
poetic s hap e, a I1ght 
consistency. a hint of flavor, 
and Proust. They are 
eminently suitab le for 
morning tea, a post -prandial 
sweet , afternoon tea. dessert 
following dinner, absent 
minded evening munching. 
and. so mv famllv thinks. 
breakfast aithough - one sees 
them only rarely in the 
pictures depict ing balanced 
breakfasts on the backs of 
cereal packages. Who says 
that fi ll de sll'rle French 
hterature has no relatIOn to 
life?

Rain postpones '83 
base baIlers' opener 

By TYNAN SCHMIDT 
Staff Wr""r 

Baseball is back! And this 
Tuesday marks the beginning 
of a new style of UCSD 
baseball. The new tyle : 
winning. La. t year the Triton 
men won more games than any 
other UCSD baseball team and 
earned a spot in t he divisional 
playoffs . This year they 
should be ('\,en better. The 
team is young, has depth , and 
is qUIcker than any ot her team 
before them. 

The rea so n for the

"Last year we had a young 
team, mostly freshmen and

year he has eight freshmen , 
nine sophmores, six juniors. 
and six seniurs - again a 
relatively young team. 
However, Yate~, does have 
experienced ball players

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 

Slaff Writers 
WHAT'S GOING ON HER E DEPT, [n the past few weeks, 
we have criticized the Intercollegiate Athletics Department 
extensively, We do this not to hack away at someone's career, 
but to hopefully open the eyes of thm,e responsible for a 
haphazard job, With a rise in sludent ent husiasm, and the traces 
01 cooperatlon Irom the admlOlstratlon, the I.A . Department 
must act productively. Instead, they seem to be drifting, One 
prominenl person in the department who will go nameless 
continues to compare the presenl I.A. Dept. with the oneof a few 
years ago. The analogy is supposed to convince everyone that 
they are making significant progress, Granted, the program has 
made some strides, but now that lhings are going upward, it is 
lime to seize the opport unity and capitalize . Wejust dun't sce the 
effort being made that's necessary to make the department 
flourish, and that's what it should be dOIl1g no\\ , What is most 
distressing is that it is nut the little things, but one major aspect 
that is hamp('ring the program, Not making signs to publIcize 
the event, not Issuing enough press passes to the media so they 
can cover the e\ent - they all equal one lhing: lack of pUblicitj . 
People haH' to kncl\\ when an event is occurnng regardless of 
\\ hether the) pass b) the Pa\!lion or not. Ob\'lou:-.ly negative 

pres~ hinders a program, but lately it seem" the only errt'cti\'(' 
mea~ure for getting thlllgs done is POll1t IIlg OUI the flaws, 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT, The Ineptitude of Frank 
C ifford . After Rolf Benirschke had a 23 yard field goal blocked by 
Eyerson Walls during Sunday's Pro 1'30\\ I, t hiS wa~ the fullowlng 
excha nge: Gifford: "And Berirschkemlsses the field goal.Just as 
i\.loselev missed one earlier, Benirschke's kick was \\ ide (no 
mention of Walls)," The camera breaks for a shot of a sign that 
reads: "We will miss you, Bear," referring to the death of Paul 
"Bear" Bryant. Howard Cosell interjects, "I think Everson 
Walls blocked it, Frank ." Gifford: "So after the Benirschke miss, 
we'll take a break and be right back." This small item Simply 
su pports our ongoing claim that Frank Gifford is simply a 
NAME in the ABC boolh. As an announcer, Gifford IS the worst 
in the business and an embarrassment for ABC. He even makes 
Cosell sound good . Well , almost.

WAIT A MINUTE DEPT, After viewing the Westmont·Point 
Loma contest last Tuesday night. we have come to the 
conclusion that we overestimaled the quality of league play 111 
District III. Westmont was not impres Ive in defeating Pomt 
Lorna 45·42, and UCSD hasn't sparkled either, However , both 
teams will, with a little bit of luck, make It to the conference 
finals, "The balance of the league has surprised me," said Triton 
coach john Block last Tuesday. "Almost any team can upset 
another on any given night." We were incorrect earlier this year 
when we stated in this column that UCSD was not performing 
up to expcctatiom;, The league is the one t hat is not plaYlllgup to 
expectations. 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. The Bing Crosby Pro·Am in 
Pebble Beach, California suffers every year from horrendous 
weather , The California coastline enjoys fine weather eight

Monday , February 7, 19B3 

Softball to start Baseball in hitting. Helpin~ out Brown with pitching dut lCS are JUlllor Keit h Yakomoto and soph-more Eric ReynolJ s. Yates 
feels the team has better 
speed. hitting , and . defense 
than in years past. The on~y 
thing he is worn~ al?out IS 
whet her or not hIS pItchers 
ca n last throughout a 55-game 
season which features many 
Division [ and II opponents, 
first among those is perennial 
Div. I baseball powerhouse Cal 
State Fullerton. the team the 
Tritons pia) to open the 1983 
(American) season thiS 
Tuesday (at CSUF). 

Irip for the team to get 
emol ionall) ready for thIs 
season. "We looked temble," 
says Yates in reference to 
preseason games after I he 
trip." But as the season gets 
closer the team is starting to 
get anxious." 

continued from page 15 
year's Most Inspirational 
Player and catcher-turned-
everything, returns behind the 
plate thi ' season.Jan Martin , a 
SOllthpaw who saw action at 
second a few times last season, 
returns to familiar turf at 
first, and Leigh Ann Layton , 
whose strong and deadly 
accurate throws from the 
outfield drew cheers from 
spectator5 and respect from 
opposing ba 'erunnen;, returns 
to the outfield 

Val "She loves to bunt that 
ball" Hardie also returns, 
hop e full y with enough 
bunting wizardry retained 
from last season to again 
torture oppo ing infielders and 
otherwL e finesse and finagle 
more than a few hits. Last but 
not least , Ceec Chisholm, the 
blur at third with the dazzling 
foot and glove work, returns in 
the outfield. 

With a squad of a baker's 
dozen at thi point, Wight says 
the Tritons are barely making 
it now but says they hope to 
add another six or so good 
players before long. She says 
another six to 10 st udents sa id 
they wanted to play but class 
chedules were too prohib-

itive. 
Whatever the number or 

the record, the Tritons again 
seem to be long on spirit. 
Wight says she wants to 
cultivate a "sports are fun" 
attitude and notes, "Win, lose 
or draw. we want to develop a 
positl\e attitude." 

Basketball and softball's 
perennial time conflicts for 
players takinli; on both sporb 

cire no problem. "I want them 
to do well at ba::,ketball. Their 
season will be over for them 
soon enough and we'll s till 
have the bulk of ours 
remaining," WIght says. "ft' s 
important (tha l) players 
concent rate on the s ason they 
are in at the time." 

Wight says she wants 
players to make the practices 
when they can, but team 
morale must supersede hard 
and fast rules which require 
players report to all prartices 
and which serve more to foster 
dis 'ension and poor morale 
than anythmg else. 

Swimming 
continued from page 17 
an at her, making last ·minute 
ent ry choices for each event 
contingent upon the opposing 
team's game plan. "Strategy 
plays an important part in a 
dual meet ," informed Morgan. 
"It definitely makes the meet 
exciting." 

Third year veteran 
wimmer Tracy Strahl is 

ready for Tuesday's challenge. 
"We're definitely not going to 
let thi ' one slip through our 
hands," he warned. "We've 
got revenge on our minds -
we're psyched." It looks as 
though the UCSD SW Immers 
are already beginning to feel 
the natural high of that 
miraculous hormone adren-
aline. Tomorrow night the 
energy flow in the Natatorium 
should be at an all·time high as 
the the two rivab clash in an 
aqual1c showdown. 

continued from page 15 
Senior Mike Brown "is' 

probably the best player this 
school has ever had ,"accord-
ing to hIS coach. Brown is a 
very ver~a tile pIa yer; w hen he 
is not the starting catcher, he 
is on t he mound pitching for 
the Trit on ballclub. Last year 
was Brown 's best year at 
pitcher and he shou ld be even 
more promising thi s year. Also 
returning is Brian Kummer, a 
four year stali er, anel third 
baseman Jay ,ierzchula. 

ierzchula was hurt last year 
but if he stays healthy he 
should help build a sahel 
infield. Two transfer st udents. 
John Rolph and Tim Archer, 
will also aid the team . Rolph 
adds defensive speed to the 
outfield, while Archer should 
lead the team if not the league 

Preseason for the II C SD 
baseball team has been quite 
dIfferent t han that of any year 
before. Thl' team's hIstoric 
trip to China in December has 
left t hem with a memory they 
are not going to forget, but the 
I rip has also been a worry for 
Coach Yates. It has taken 
three or four weeks after the 

Running Thoughts 
continued from page 17 
months of the year and the golf tour lasts nine months. Why 
doesn 't the PGA schedule the Crosby after March? By 
rescheduling the event three years ago from a mid-January 
weekend to the first weekend in February, at least they've 
shown that they realize the problem. At the curr~nt rate th~ugh, 
it'll only take 32 more years before the Crosby IS appropriately 
played in April. 
COULD IT BE DEPT_ This column will come to an end very 
oon unless we can obtain an enormous amount of cash. If you 

read our Super Bowl predictions , you should know that both of 
us were in error when we tabbed Miami in Pasadena . Being 
confident (the way we somet ime are), we called our bookie, who 
doubles as a Running Thoughts correspondent in Las Vegas, and 
told him to bet a large sum of money on the Dolphins. If wedo not 
rai 'e a substantial amount of cash very soon, or receiYe t he large 
loan from Bank of America that we recently applie(J:fo"r, we will 
have to quit school and move to Boli VIa. 

As Dresia no Solari said 
before g01l1g to China, "Last 
year we were t rend ·setters." 
This year's squad hopes to 
continue that trend . "The 
guys have a good attitude and 
share common goals, "adds 
Yale'> . The goal for the team is 
to go over 500 in league play, 
which starts March 1 S against 
Azusa-Pacific, and to make it 
to t he playoffs again. This 
time a.., a contender.

UCSD's CO-OPS unique facet 
of student life, yet obscure

environment. 

Part of the meaningof co-ops 
is "the goal toward changing 
s<xietv\; structure, and in 
having cooperation versus 
competition," a serted co·op 
member Kaaren Bekken. In 
l '(SD co-ops, she said that she 
has found a "group of people 
who cares about you - more of 
a family·type organIzation." 

Competing with 
bureaucracy 

How does the university 
admil1lstration feel about the 
coops' existence? Cammie 
Rice, a staff person at the 
Student Center, ..,ald that 

"The untverslty was reluctant 
to acknowledge co-ops." 

After co ops began appear 
ing at {lCSD. the uni\er"lt\ 
did de\e!olx' gUidelines for 
them. Tlwse guidl'1ines deal

The people at the :tudent 
Center \\"ho have worked 
directly with the co-ops seem 
\cry supportl\'e of them. 
Maryann Mason, facilities 
manager at the Student 
Center, said that. "Co-ops are 
a great workIng experIence in 
business and communica-
tion." he added that. 
.. tudent s have more insight 
into what students need ." 

Students and staff in the 
tudent Center both criticize 

the univerSity administra-
tIOn's dealings with theco-ops. 
Marco LiMandn, who was the 
Student Center's co-op ad\'isor 
from September 1980 to 
August 1982, said that, "The 
administration didn't know 
how to deal WIth coops 

bccause t hcy were never 
anticipated, and they don't fall 
into a certam category." 

And Corlew complained of 
"\l'1"\ lit tit administrative 
s upport and technical 
asslstancl· ... 

The Studt'nt Ct.'nter has had 
problems 01 its 0\\'11 , and, 
l'onst'qul'l1tl~', the ('o-op<.;

an admll1lst ra t ion and ~t udt'nl

rcsuhed. it is unlikd\' thaI the 
adnllni~tlation will deal with 
the (o·ops 111 defInll1g thcir 
long term direction. 

The currcnt Acting Student 
Center Director, Ravmond 
Dye, <.;aid he is "10 favo-r of co-
ops." He sees the co-ops as 
prOViding a training ground 
for bu. iness , as well as useful 
student services on campus. 

Sinc the tudent Center 
director is responsible for the 
co-ops, Dye explained that 
there needs to be developed a 
"clearcut mechanism of how 
deciSIOns a re made." He added 
that he would like to see a 
coopcrative relationship 
betwe('n the administra tion 
and the co-ops. When asked if 
he wants to see co-ops 
institutionaltzed into the 

tudent Center, he sa id, 

The General Store ('atcr~ to many Hud dl\ cr»o(' (wed

Although man) ..;t udents 

and some unl\'crslt \ offiCIals 
vOICe support for the C(l-OPS, 
their future gro\\th and 
lI1tegratlOn tnto the uni\'ersi t y 
remains unccrtain. 

There is a "space problem" 
in the Student Center \\ hich 
has limited thc growth of the 
exiting co-ops. Advocates of 
t he co-ops have made 
proposals for more room 111 the 
Student Center which wou ld 
juggle office space and usc 
some of the recreation and 
lounge space, but those plans 
have been vetoed by Raymond 
Dye and Vice Chancellor 
Joseph Watson as being "self-
serving" to t he interests of t h 
co-ops and not to the needs of 
all student s 

Some belIeve that gro\\ th is 

possi ble \\'1 tit Pha "'t' II I lit t It(· 
Student Celltn, which 
II1\'ol\,('s t'll'Ct Ing allot hn

{'\.lstll1g Student Ctntel. It 
cou ld mean additIOnal "paces 
and faCIlIties for theexpanslon 
of new and existtng C()·ops . 

This whole plan is tentative, 
though , depending upon a 
student referendum . loor 
Phase 1I1 to materialtze , 
"S tud ent. have to tax 
themselves to build this," says 
LiM andri. Th e referendu'm 
\\()u ld entad some fe ($25 per 
quarter has been mentioned) 
for a certall1 number of years . 

At this time, the future of 
UCSD's unique and diverse co-
ops is uncertain, dependi nQ" 
upon the actions of the 
students and admtnistratlon.
