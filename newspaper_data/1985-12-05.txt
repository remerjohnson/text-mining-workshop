AS aims to 
redirect TGs 

Students have complained of a 
lack of TGIF panies this quaner. 
The perceived reduction in T.G.s 
this fall (to three from five last 
fall quaner) is pan of an effon to 
de-emphasize alcohol 
consumption and make T.G.s the 
"special event" that they were 
Originally designed to be, several 
AS members said. 

T.G.s had become a "bi-weekly 
occasion to get hammered," said 
Josh Beckman, AS Programming 
Commissioner. It was the 
original intent of the T.G. to 
function as a release from the 
rigors of academia, but the 
abundance of T.G.s in the past 
diminished the novelty and 
created merely an "atmosphere to 
drink," according to AS President 
Mary Rose Alexander. 

In light of the current alcohol 
policy on campus, a "cohesive 
agreement" was struck between 
the administration and the AS to 
ensure that T.G.s would 
continue, Beckman said. Pan of 
this agreement was that the T.G.s 
be more controlled , resulting in 
better police security, and plastiC 
wristbands to replace hand 
stamps as age verification, he 
said. 

In the past, police were not 
present at T.G.s. Security was 
enforced by student volunteers. 

'Students who wished to drink 
showed identification to prove 
they were over 21 , and received 
a hand stamp which allowed 
them to get free beer. 

, The past system made the age 
law enforcement difficult, 
Beckman said. Local high 
schoolers were attracted by T.G.s, 
which created the problem

Qecause they and other groups 
left non-T.G. containers in the 
parking lOts, he said. "The new 
system allows us to have the 
event;" Beckman said. 

Next quaner the T.G.s will be 
more Strategically arranged to 
avoid the kind of "gap" that 
occurred this quaner, Alexander 
said. The firs! T.G. was in week 
I, the second,.in week 6. 

The AS also plans to sponsor: 
noon concerts on Wednesdays, a 
video dance, more film series, an 
all campus talent show, the 
College Bowl, a concen in the 
gym, lectures and other activities, 
Beckman said . 

In addition the AS is running 
a contest that will award up to 
$1,000 to the student that 
submits the best idea for a 
school event. The money will be 
used to stage the event. The last 
TG of the quaner will be 
tomonow Dec. 6. 

Tenninal talks 
to the blind 

A "talking tenninal" Prototype 
developed by the University of 
Califomia's Division of Library 
Automation (DlA), will enable 
blind and other visually impaired 
students at UC for the first time 
to use a UC library catalog 
without assistance. 

The terminal unit incorporates 
a keyboard labeled with large 
letters and braille, a screen 
display that magnifies print, and 
a digital speech syntheSizer. It is 
connected to UC's MELVYL (TM) 
Online Catalog. It will benefit 
120 students at UC's nine 
campuses who are blind or near-
blind , DLA project manager, 
Bennett Price, said. 

To the totally blind , the unit 

speaks DY means of digital 
speech synthesis. For those with 
panial vision, a large print 
adapter enlarges the screen' 
disply up to 16 times its normal 
size. Each tenninal costs around 
510,000, with additional cost for 
a braille printer if funher 
evaluation recommends it. 
Harold gains 
popularity 

Harold has been popular on 
many college campuses and may 
even hit the big time with 
corporate sponsorship. Don't you 
know who Harold is? Harold is a 
theater game based on 
improvisation invented by an 
actor, Del Close. Teams 
improvise on the stage in 
response to themes suggested by 
the audience, which then scores 
the teams' perfonnances.

Wolfsheimer 
takes office 
By CHERYL CARtwRIGHT, Staff Writer 

Abbe Wolfsheimer was 
Inaugurated December 2 as 
Councilmember for the San 
Diego District I, which includes 
La Jolla, Rancho Penasquitos, 
Rancho Bemardo, Del Mar 
Heights, University City and San 
Pasqua\. 

In recent San Diego elections, 
she won 52 percent or 70,505 
votes to defeat two-tenn 
incumbent Bill Mitchell . 

For the past 11 years, 
Wolfsheimer has been at 
Westem State University of Law 
as depanment chair and 
professor of real property law. 
From 1979 until 1983, she 
worked two terms with the 
Zoning Appeals Board. 

Wolfsheimer feels well 
acquainted with land use and 
the consequent transponation 
and population problems, she 
said In an interview November 
22. 

She opposed Proposition A 
because she feels that it would 
cost taxpayers too much money 
that would be better spent for 
crime prevention and 
transportation 

Crime control is Wolfsheimer's 
priority, she said. She favors 
increasing the number of police. 
At the state level, she proposes 
stiffer sentences for crimes with 
victims. City and county 
govemments must work together 
to build "much needed" new 
jails, she said. 

Wolfsheimer plans to propose 
an Abuse Center for victims of 
spouse battering, child abuse, 
and iIl-treaanent of the elderly. 
She feels that such a center is 
desperately needed as the city of 
San Diego has no such shelter 
and there is only one in San 
Diego County. 

Statistics show that 75 percent 
to 80 percent of all felons were 
abused children, she said . She 
advocates the establishment of a 
centrally located temporary home 
and shelter for abused people. 

Currently, abused children are 
returned home after three days 
and often the home problems are 
"not resolved but only

intensified: and the child is in 
danger of worse abuse, according 
to Wolfsheimer. 

The center would provide 
individual and family 
psycholOgical and legal 
representation. Medical treatment 
would still be provided by local 
hospitals as it is now. As well, 
the proposed center would 
provide administration space for 
relief and abuse prevention 
agencies. 

Wolfsheimer considers herself 
a feminist. She hopes to promote 
the treatment and prevention of 
wife and victim abuse and 

su~rts the maintertance of 
Ie d abonion. She advocates 
sponsored child-care centers to 
allow women to enter the work 
market. She also believes in equal 
opponunity in employment for 
homosexuals. 

Wolfsheimer ran for the 
council because she was 
·concemed about the way the 
city was progressing" and "is 
very interested in people and 
learning." rz:J 

For the record 
On Monday, the Guardian ran a 
story stating that the UCSD Day 
Care Center has 88 full-time 
employees. The actual number is 
12 full-time employees. The Day 
Care Center also employs 57 
pan-time work-study students, 
who.average 10 hours per week. 
The Guardian regrets the error.

Don't cross lines without looking at the sign 
"Stop children, what's that sound? Everybody look what's going down ... " 

Buffalo Springfield 
working men and women that these companies make millions off of, 
every year. 

Over 60 people have been arrested and 15 injured since the United 
Food and Commercial Workers Union and the Teamsters went on 
strike against the major supennarket chains in California. 

EveI)' time you cross a picket line to buy your gallon of milk or a 
pound of hamburger meat you are making a statement that will 
ultimately affect the outcome of the strike. 

Who is at fault or whose responsibility it is to cure the economic 
problem of the food business should be decided by the individual 
consumer, but a decision must be made. If you refuse to acknowledge a 
festering social problem it will only grow worse and more bloody. Don't 
let ignorance be your excuse if you choose to shop at one of these 
stores. If you choose to cross the picket lines, at least be aware of the 
situation you are entering and how you are an integral pan of the batde. 

Civil disobedience and human suffering is something that cannot be 
ignored and, because of it, neither can the strike that is the root of it. 

The batde between the meatcutters and the supermarkets is not a new 
one. It is reflective of a national trend in the current management labor 
relations. The markets (Vans, Alpha Beta , Albertson's, Food Basket, 
Hughes, Safeway and Ralphs) contend that union rules and regulations 
must be relaxed to cut costs and rescue the ailing food sale business. 
Labor claims that such a move would threaten the union members' job 
security. 

Although it is understood that management must continually trim 
their fat in order to survive in a fierce and competitive supennarket 
arena, from a realistic perspective, that fat would be the same hard

Tizzied in Tijuana 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to An 
Salazar's anicle. "A Tijuana 
journey reveals social conflicts" 
in the Dec. 1 issues of The 
Guardian . I am sure that An 
meant well , but he comes off like 
a real ass. I'm sorry. An, b ut I 
believe your trip to Tijuana to 
"collect research information" 
was a token trip to justify your 
preconceived idea of what it is 
like to be oppressed and in 
poverty. 

I spent four years going to 
school in Tijuana and it makes 
me furious to think that the 
various people and relatives I 
know there would be 
"interesting" to you "in a p itiable 
way," or that you would describe 
them as "destitute people who 
probably look across the border 
and wish for a litde of our 
prosperity." Obviously. you 
consider yourself very lucky and 
very safe from the horrors of 
living in streets that "resemble 
the Barnum and Bailey Circus," 
"the glamour mixed with 
shambles," the "decadence for 
the economy-conscious." "the 
sad curio vendors." 

Perhaps there are worse things 
than poverty, An. There are the 
patronizing and superior 
individuals who have aD the 

'material wealth and social graces 
to believe that they lack nothing. 
There are those who have never 
had to suffer the injustices of 
exploitation and therefore f:r:d 
litde sensitivity in their heans to 
extend tOwards those who have. 
There are those who have been 
so isolated and cushioned within 
a "comfottable" environment that 
to displace them into any other 
is eqUivalent to taking a badly 
equipped organism and 
condemning him to death. I find 
this sad. I find the incapability 
of seeing a human ~ing behind 
"wrinkled work clothes" and 
"d iscomfoning faces' extremely 
tragic . 

I found myself questioning the 
intent of the anicle. Were you 
trying to make a statement about 

Tijuana. the United States 
government or were you just 
trying to epitomize superficiality? 
Perhaps if the writing had not 
been so disjOinted and 
superfluous I would have known 
whether to take offense to your 
anicle because you are an 
ignorant and unaware student, or 
whethter to take offense because , 
although you meant well . you're 
irresponsible and you just can't 
write. 1 am giving you thew 
benefit of the doubt and 
concluding th,at you just can't 
write - ~cause it seemed to me 
that you made some kind of 
effon to redeem the 
d owntrodden victims of poverty 
at the end of you aItkle; "The 
world has pooh·poohed Mexican 
an as sub·stamdard but this is 
far from true." Then, you 
proceeded to name two great 
anists. one of which happened 
to be Mexican, (Federico Garcia 
Lorca, you should know, An. is a 
Spaniard.) 

I also questioned. Art. why you 
would assume that an offer from 
three girls "of middle class 
backgrounds," (another 
assumption?) to show you the 
town should impress upon you a 
"quiedy made statement about 
Mexican culture"? 

Did the-d~nken patron of 
one of the clubs, whom you 
deduced, "was drinking to drown 
his sorrows," also make a quiet 
statement of Mexican culture? Is 
:'::.~:i~g.~n, Tijuana so 

~Jl ~lUUllC I I\lt ! 
It seems to me, An. that you 

saw e~cdy what you wanted to 
see. The interpretations were 
pre-meditated and the "journey" 
to Tijuana might as well have 
been fabricated . 

It's important that you 
understand my point, An. I feel 
you hitve unfairly and 
condescendingly judged a 
countty that is paIt of my life. 
You have carelessly offended my 
people and friends. You wrote 
that "one way to ~ner 
understand each other's culture 
is through an," and though J 
would normally ~ree, r think 

. that for some people it's easier to 
understand another culture 
without bias, if first, they attempt 
to understand the~ves.

cars, has [WO children and [WO 
homes. They fail [0 accept that 
we also have many internal 
0l?p~ssive problems [0 deal 
WIth. 

Let us distill the first 
statement. May I clarify that I do 
not include myself in the "us" of 
the first sentence, - since I 
myself am Mexican and am bitter 
over how rpe United Stales. 
through its imperialistic actions •. 
has stilted development not only 
in Latin America. but through the 
Third World (as defined by it 
time of industrialization on the 
historical timetable and not as 
the notion oc"third' used in the 
Olympic games). The way in 
which this sta~ment relates [0 
the next is to the extent that it 
explains to the people of a Third 
World country how the 
generalization that every person 
in "Have-it-aD" land has It aD, 
comes as a given. They 
understand the United Sta~s 
based on thier concrete 
experience: as an imperialist 
agressor nation. The ~yere 
internal unrest. repression and 
oppression that exists in the 
United States is kept well hidden 
from the international 
community via me restricted 
press coverage on internal issues. 
The government of the United 
Slates and its supporters 
(multinationals and elites), have 
a vest~d interest in perpetuating 
this farce: presenting the United 
States as the land of the free , the 
equal. the land of opponunity 
and the land that Dtmocracy has 
chosen as its permanent 
headquarters. this farce functions 
as the rationalization for • 
imperiaiist and direct militarY 

i~~rventio~.:: ';,c'navior. Be~use 
uns social reality is hard to 
understand in the United Sla~s , 
it is understandable that the 
international community finds 

the news of severe strife within 
the United States surprising. For 
example, during my trip to 
Nicaragua with a Chicano 
Theatre company it was hard to 
explain why it was that one of 
the actresses which looked very 
Indian (Azteca) and was born to 
Mexican parents in Arizona 
spoke only about six words of 
Spanish (not uncommon for 
Chicanos in this counay). 
Nicaraguans at first thought it 
was a joke, a kind of spying 
game so that we could hear what 
they said about us by pretending 
that Cristina did not understand 
Spanish. As they convinced 
themselves of this truth their 
attitude went from disbelief at 
such a ludicrous and violent 
condition, [0 anger at the 
"Empire" which even found 
extreme ways to tear people 
within its own geographical 
location. 

The second statement is 
quickly clarified by defining who 
the "they" in the sen~nce refers 
to. As I said before, this 
observation came at a Ia~r point 
in my convesation and rela~d to 
the fact that most people in this 
country (they) fail to accept that 
there are also many in~mal 
oppressive problems in this 
(U.S.) country to deal with. For 
example, statements like "We are 
equal in this country" and 'We 
dealt with racism in the '60s" 
deny the american reality where

Salvageable traits 
By KATHY BECKETT 

The women's liberation 
movement has been called many 
things and has taken many 
fo rms. This myrb d of 
interpreta tions and meanings is 
partially due to the d ive rsity of 
women's rights acti vists . 
themselves, but also contributing 
to the ambiguLty and confusion 
that encapsulates feminism is the 
evolutionary nature of the 
movement. Early fem in ists, in 
thei r rejec tion of the tradinonal 
female sex role, made the 
mistake of equating the liberation 
oT wome n with the emulation of 
"male" behaviour; the result was 
simply the repla<;ement of the 
"female" role wi th the simi larly 
confi ning "male" role. Women 
attempted [0 show that they, [00. 
could be aggreSSive and 
competitive; in doing so, they 
(understandably) turned bOth 
men and women away from the 
feminist movement. 
Inappropriate. ind iscriminate 
aggression and competitive ness 
are as obnoxious in women as 
they are in men. 

A friend recently told me that 
her enthusiasm for the women's 
movement was tempered by the 
fac t that "she wanted to be free 
to be a woman." It seems that 
the early feminists have 
convinced her that [0 be a 
fe minist, one must be willing to 
relinquish the right " [0 act like a 
woman." But thi s. I think. is not 
the point of the sexual 
revolution. Women do not have 
to act "like men ," nor do men 
have to act "like women." Rather, 
each individual must be freed 
from the restramts of traditional 
sex roles. These roles stifle 
creativity and limit the 
expression of self by placing 
behavioral pre- and pro· 
scriptions on every individual. 
Fa ilure to comply with those 
standards all to often leads [0 
feelings of guilt and low self-
esteem. 

Some may object to this 
proposal on the grounds that the 
behavioral differences between 
men and women are biological 
in origin. Studies show. however. 
that the vast majority of sex-
linked behaviour is a result of 
the socialization process rather 
than biological or hormonal 

d ifferences. There is some 
evidence tha t aggreSSive 
be haviour is related to the level 
of testosterone, in the 
bloodstream, howeve r. this 
be havioral diffe rence cannot be 
accounted fo r solely' by the 
highe r level of thi s hormone 
fo und in males. Indeed, the 
variation in be havioral trai ts such 
as aggression among women and 
among men is much greater than 
the d ifference between the sexes. 

The cost of trad itional sex 
roles has been immense. Women 
have stifled their need for 
achievement and' creative 
expression. men have denied 
their emOtional and se nsitive 
side in an attempt to fit neatly 
into society's description of ideal 
women and men. Libe ration will 
occur not when the content of 
prescribed sex roles is changed , 
but when the p rescription is 
removed entirely. For women's 
rights activists to devalue 
senSitivi ty and compassion. or to 
belittle the invaluable service 
provided by mothers and 
housewives is simply to repeat 
the mistake that society has 
made for centuries - namely. to 
assume that whatever is 
trad itionally associated with 
women is of less value. We must 
strive to salvage what is good 
about traditional "female" and 
"male" behavior. attempt [0 
develop these qualities in each of 
us. learn to use each in the 
appropriate manner and 
situation and allow people [0 
develop and grow in an 
envi ronment that is free of 
debilitating sexual 
stereotypes. ~

Edilor: 

In "The unacceptable choices 
of a crowded university," Shelly 
Simmons is unjustified in her 
criticisms of UCSD. One bad 
experience by one student, 
whether she is an editor for the 
Guardian or not. is not enough [0 
condemn an entire univers ity's 
educational philosophy. As a 
sophomore. J was unsure of 
whether 1 would be able to get 
into one of the classes 1 wamed , 
an upper-division course 
completely outside my major, 
requiring a depanment stamp. 
Since the course has only one 
section and limited enrollment. I 
got the necessary department 
stamp a week early. then 
dropped the form by the 
registrar'S office the .same day, 
putting me ahead of anyone 
"biting and scratching in the line 
with (their) salivating peers at 
7:30." If Shelly Simmons feels the 
need to wait until the last day to 
register for the last quaIter for a 
course that is so impottant to 
her. then that is none of my 
business. However. the Guardian 
editors were out of line by 
allowing her to throw a three-
quarter page temper tantrum in

Everytime a medical or social

not? What does th is say about

The major contradiction I am 
trying [0 illustrate her is how can 
women claim equality and 
greater need at the same time? 
We can't be both needy and 
strong. We have to choose which 
image we prefer and the issues 
we claim as our own will gready 
determine that image. 

1 don't know what issues are 
on the agenda of th is committee, 
but I do know the one and only 
thing females need that males 
don't are 
Obsterricians/ Gyncecologists.

these. ' 

The one th ing we don't need

ink bleeds all over those of us 
who are hired not to meet a

desirable employees who are 
paid more not because the law 
mandates this. but because we've 
earned it. 

FinaDy, we do not need the

Only the Ministry 
Editor: 

I would like to respond to 
MarkJohnson's letter of Nov. 18 
regarding the involvement of 
Campus Crusade for Christ 
(CCC) in the campaign to defeat 
Proposition A. the slow growth 
initiative. CCCs interest in Prop 
A had nothing to do with "more 
dollars in the Sunday morning 
collection plate ." but rather the 
establishment of an International 
Christian Graduate Universsity 
here in San Diego. Prop A was 
designed to affect the 
development of the university. 

A for-profit subsidiary of CCC, 
University Development. Inc. 
(UD!) is a business chaned with 
the responsibiliry of establishing 
the university and endowing it. 
In that capaciry. UDI naturally 
sought to defeat Prop A As pan 
of its responsibility, UD! raises 
the funds that are needed to 

fulfi ll its reason for being. UD~ 
takes out normal business loans 
and operates as would any other 
development finn. It was from 
these funds - not CCC ministry 
funds - that the $217 ,000 Mr. 
Johnson spoke of came from. 

I hope , Mr. Johnson, that you 
can sleep aga in at night knowing 
that Jesus Christ never left the 
"occupation" you mentioned.

Don't you decide! -
Editor: 

This is an open letter to the 
Coalition for a Free South Africa: 

Freedom is not a commodity 
which is given. Nor does it enter 
into any utilitarian equation. It is 
the inalienable right of all human 
beings. The fact that Anuro 
Cruz's point of view is espoused 
by President Reagan, Lany 
Speakes and George Shultz in no 
way legitimizes your fascist 
tactics. Freedom of speech isn't 
something that is given [0 a 
point of view. it is guaranteed to 
all individuals regardless of their 
point of view. 

If you truly believe that it is "of 
the utmost importance that 
people thoroughly inform 
themselves" why don't you act 
that way? People inform 
themselves by hearing all sides of 
an issue and making up their 
own mind. Your actions show a 
general fear of a free flow of . 
information which teUs me you 
mustn't think [00 highly of your 
own position. If Mr. Cruz acrually 
did "come to UCSD to 
regurgitate .. . lies and 
disinformation' then it would 
have bveen obvious to aD of us. 
This must not have been the 
case. You were so threatened by 
what he had to say that you nO[ 
only decided not to listen, but 
also to impose your wishes on 
others. But you forgot one thing: 
you have neither the right nor 
the wisdom nor the vinue to 
decide what I can and cannot 
hear. 

The next time you feel 
arrogant enough to make 
decisions for others, wear brown 
shins. If you are going to act like 
them. you might as well look like 
them.

Iceman thaws over 
Guardian Angels 
By JOHN TOMAN 

I met Iceman on the street. He 
had this 'Tm cool" look about 
him, his small but muscular form 
striding along with an 
instinctive , fluid sureness. His 
clothes were intimidating; slick 
black slacks, a scarlet beret and a 
shiny leather jacket over which a 
T-shin clung. The T-shin had 
symbols on it, emblazoned in 
bright red; there was an eye 
(symboliZing vigilance) 
surrounded by a pyramid 
(representing unity) with wings 
spreading from it (indicating an 
angel) , above a cloud (meaning 
prejudices). The shirt read , in 
bold red and black leners, 
"Guardian Angel Safety Patrol." 

subway. He recalls, WIth a 
confident grin , that "In the last 
car, a lady of 16 Qr 17 was giving 
binh and an Angel was there 
assisting in the birth. So that to 
me was something you wouldn't 
expect a Guardian Angel to be 
involved in." 

The Angels are volunteers who 
work a minimum of eight hours 
a week. To be one, you must be 
16 or older, in school or working 
full-time, with no criminal 
convictions or violent crimes, 
although Iceman says, ·We're 
usually pretty lenient on petty 
theft." Prospective Angels go 
through three months of training 
in martial arts, first aid, citizen's 
arrest, proper handcuffing 
techniques, and public relations 
before graduating. 

Iceman remembers. The patrol 
couldn't run on to private 
property, but fonunately , the 
man chased the woman into the 
street, where he taunted and 
insulted the crowd. When he 
attacked an Angel , they were able 
to apprehend the man. 

"The law only provides for so 
much ," Iceman says. "We can't 
j ust simply pounce on somebody 
and beat them to a pulp and 
hand two hands in cuffs to the 
police and say 'Here's your 
suspect.' . .. We cry to use as little 
force as necessary. but enough 
force to do the job." 

Sometimes there are weeks 
and even months with "nothing 
going down . We consider that to 
be a successful patrol." If a patrol 
encounters more than the 
average number of violent 
incidents he feels "people are 
not getting the message of what

Annando Basulto. nicknamed "Iceman," a San Diego chapter leader of 
the Guardian Angels - "If we started palroling UCSD ... we 'd want to be 
able to say you're the ones that called us ... · 

lcernan is really 20-year-old 
Annando Basulto . the San Diego 
chapter co-leader of the 
Guardian Angels. He is originally 
from the South Bronx in ~ 
York, where some friends 
nicknamed him Iceman. saying 
he was "born in a meat locker." 
He's been a Guardian Angel for 
one and a half years, first in New 
York and now in San Diego. 

The Guardian Angels are a 
community awareness 
organization much like 
neighborhood watch and similar 
organizations. "All the Guardian 
Angels really do, " Iceman says 
emphatically, "is bring back the 
old ethics of the pioneer days 
when ... people watched each 
other's backs ... All we cry to do 
is be the eyes and ears of the 
neighborhood. " 

The regular patrol nights are 
Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays 
- also military paydays and 
concert nights. Usually eight 
members make up a patrol. The 
Angels meet at a deSignated 
quarter in the city, where the 
patrol leader frisks all the 
members. If anyone is carrying a 
weapon , is intoxicated oron drugs. 
"His colors are automatically 
pulled ," says Iceman in a formal 
military tone while gesturing at 
his uniform. 

Clips from a larger plant 

Founded in New York in 
1979, the Guardian Angels now 
boast 57 chapters worldwide, in 
nearly every major city in the 
United States. California's 
chapters are in Los Angeles, 
Sacramento, San Francisco and 
San Diego. 

The San Diego chapter patrols 
high crime neighborhoods such 
as Logan Heights, Balboa Park, 
Chicano Park and downtown 
areas which the Angels have 
been invited to patrol. They 
watch for violent crimes, "Crimes 
against private citizens and 
property: said leeman. "We 
don't get involved with non-
violent crimes such as jay-
walking or underage drinking." 

UCSD isn't covered by the 
Angels. "If we staned walking 
around UCSD, we'd want 10 
make sure that we could answer 
back if people stan saying 'Go 
back to New York. We don't 
wam you here.' We'd wam to be 
able to say, 'Hey, you're the ones 
thaI caUed us in the first place!'" 

Iceman prefers San Diego to 
New York where "everything's 
segregated , everything's tight. 
Within a three block radius you 
walk into another neighborhood 
and it's a whole new world. I 
would never bring up a family in 
the South Bronx." He came to 
California because "here 
everything's loose." 

San Diego, he says. is "more or 
less the same situation: crime 
everywhere. In San Diego, you 
don't have the subways, but you 
still have the streets and 
neighborhoods: The gangs and 
segregation are largely absent , but 
he thinks that some of the 
"hoods" he's seen here are worse 
than those in New York. 

Iceman's most memorable 
experience was in a New York 

A patrOl consists of a leader, 
assistant leader, first-aid man, 
telephone runners (who call for 
help) and runners (the first two 
to reach a crime area). If the 
Angels see a crime in progress, 
they execute a citizen's arrest, 
"just by stopping a person's 
motion." They patrol the bar 
scene, clubs and neighborhoods 
in pairs. Around midnight, 
before breaking up , the patrol 
discusses anything that 
happened that night. 

In New York. "Police are just 
waiting for a chance to bust you 
on anything," even jay-walking. 
Iceman flings his arms around as 
if frustrated . "They'd love to bust 
an Angel and tarnish the image." 
He says that the Angels have 
received negative publicity like, 
Iceman says, "'We will not allow 
these vigilantes : which we are 
not. ... Vigilante connotes lynch 
mobs of me old Wild West. We 
don't go out and judge, jury and 
execute." 

The San Diego police have 
been more receptive, he thinks, 
his expression calming 
somewhat But he feels some 
individual cops think they're'1ust 
punks looking for a legal way to 
fight." He stresses that "We 
simply act with the rights of any 
citizen. Any private citizen has 
the right to make a citizen's 
arrest if he sees the crime." 

The red beret and the T-shin 
serve as a visual deterrent. 
Iceman tells me, adjusting hiS 
own eve-catchinlZ hat. He thinks 
it makes it easier for intended 
victims and suspects to SpOt the 
Angels. "If you're in a subway 
and you need to yell for 
assistance, the only way you 
know a Guardian Angel is to see 
a red beret over the heads." 

Sometimes though , fights are 
unavoidable. In Logan Heights. 
Iceman's patrol stumbled across a 
large crowd watching a man who 
wa3 trying to kill hiS franti C wife . 
"Everybody was toO busy 
watching to call the police." 

By KEN FURlE. StD.ff Writer 
On the day I was leaving for 

college, my mother took me 
aside and gave me a check, and 
a plant. ' 

"It's a philodendron , Ken." 
"Geez, mom, I've got no use 

for a plant. I'll just kill it." 
"Take it, it'll brighten up 

your ... " 
"It'll die on me. mom. I don't 

know anything about plants, and 
I won't have time ... " 

She wouldn't hear of it, of 
course, and insisted that 1 take 
the pla!)t and care for it. We 
said goodbye, I 'took the check 
and the plant, and began my 
illustrious career as a student. It 

was a beginning. 
My roommate, Mike, a 

sophomore. whom I perceived as 
uncommonly worldly almost 
immedtately, told me a bit about 
my plant "Phil," as he coined the 
name. He told me that it had 
probably been clipped from a 
larger plant, since it was just a 
tiny stem with only a pair of 
small leaves on it He said it 
wouldn't be so difficult to grow, 
all I really had to do was to water 
it occasionally. and most of the 
growth would be invisible and 
unnoticed. 

"Until someday," he grinned, 
"itl1 be so bi~ that you'U have to 

change pots." 1 joked that 1 
would go to sleep one night, and 
the plant would kill me, rather 
than vice-versa . 

My first year in college was 
not unusual. I went home a lot, 
since my mother only lived in 
Los Angeles, and received 
support in the mail from her, in 
the form of cards, leuers, care 
packages and, of course , checks. 
1 was homesick some of the 
time, having never truly been on 
my own. and would lay on my 
bed and speculate. I would look 
at Phil, who was neglected , and 
see how the leaves were curling 
along the edges and yellowing. 
"Dying, I see," I would think at it. 
So what? What use are you 
anyway? 

'Fimils week arrived, and I 
acquired some first-hand 
experience with panic. So much 
work, so li ttle time; so 1 nearly 
killed myself with studying, and 
many times was on the verge of 
quitting. 

"Chuck it all," I thought. How 
easy it would be. Go home. Find 
an easy job, get married . jump 
off a building; don 't we always 
toy with such thoughts at 
unpleasant times? And as I 
would sit at my desk, head in 
hands, I would feel the presence 
of Phil. imposing itself on my 
mind. My eyes were drawn to it. 
It was darkening, now, with the 
yellow deepening throughout 
into brown. It had tried to sprout 
a new leaf, but was 
undernourished . I pitied it. 

Then I grew angry. 1 didn't 
have time for this! "Pitying a 
plant," I thought with disgust. 
Pity myselfl I looked at it angrily, 
accusi ng it of such arrogant 
insensitivity as to make demands 
on my time when I had none. 1 
was tempted to sweep it from 
the desk, onto the hard floor: 
what a pleasant, grating crash it 
would make , as its pm breaks 
into numerous pieces, dirt flying, 
leaves tom. shard scattering. But

we're about." He thinks that 
people have to "watch their 
brother's back. That's all it takes . 
but in today's world , people look 
tHe other way." . 

Iceman works for the county, 
but he won't specify his job 
because someone might try to 
reach him there . "You get calls all 
the time," he says, imitating the 
typical heavy breathing and 
deep, throaty voice, intoning, 
"tonight an Angel will fall!" The 
main flak comes from the petty 
criminal on the street who sees 
the Angels as just another 
obstacle he has to overcome. 
Those kind of people have even 
shot at Angels. 

He thinks that the media 
sometimes overblows the 
Guardian Angels. When they 
tried and failed to establish a 
controversial chapter in Tijuana, 
"The media was there in a 
heartbeat." interviewing Mexican 
officials who called the Angels 
"terrorists." He feels that this 
wrongly infuriated the public. 
"They get more than a good dose 
in the papers and lV, bu,fit's 
veered wrong - no maner how 
many good arrests we make, no 
matter how many good things we 
do: he laments, throwing up his 
arms, "the media doesn't care." 

Directing his gaze upward, he 
says, "How can people not care 
about us? We watch over the 
meek, the helpless ... Sometimes 
our patrol consists of picking up 
trash or something. I can't 
understand why people don't . 
want to help the community." 

"We prOvide a role model for 
the younger minority youths," 
Iceman says warmly, satisfaction 
in his smile. Kids no longer have 
to be in gangs to have influence. 
"Little kids come up to me and 
say, 'I want to 'be a Guardian 
Angel. When can I be a 
Guardian Angel?''' They want to 
help their community and he 

"You get calls all the time -

I didn't. 

"Why am I mad at a plant?" I 
asked myself. "What am I doing 
here? What the hell good is 
college, anyway? What is a 
degree? What is education, sex, 
fun , companionship, sex, life? 
What the hell is life?" 

I looked at the plant for 
answers. It had none. It existed. 
"What a hell of a life it would 
be to be II plant," I thought. 
Worries? Classes? Where does 
our sociery get off forcing us to 
do things like get an education? 
Wouldn't we aU be happier, 
simpler, easier as plants? 

I found I was arguing with 
myself: "Who says society forces 
us to get an education?" I heard 
a voice in my head saying. 

"I do!" I returned. 
"That's bull, pinhead. You can 

do anything you want to. Why 
don't you get some land and 
raise some vegetables and live off 
of that?" 

"You need money to get land, 
qnd I don 't have any." 

"Work as a mechanic for a 
year and save your money: 

"I can't save money as a 
mechanic, 1 would sptnd aU 1 had 
just living from day to day." 

So live as a mechanic from 
day to day." 

"AU right. To hell with you! I 
will!" 

I flung the books from my 
desk and stormed out of the 
room. But walking/running 
through campus at night doesn't 
help you escape from your own 

mind, as I eventually found out. 
My internal struggles caught up 
with me at Central Library, and I 
wended my yray back to my 
room. 

Phil was there, of course. I 
stared at it for a long lime, as my 
breathing slowed. 

"Philodendron," I thought. "To 
hell with you, too, Philodendron. 
Ok, Philodendron, I'll make a 
deal with you. You let me make 
it through this finals week, and I 
promise to water you. Yeah, I 
promiS!! to water you, and water 
you and I1l even change pots for 
you, if you don't die. I stared at 
it some more. Ok. I'll Start right 
now." 

I got a beer mug from my 
bookcase and went to the 
bathroom. I filled it with water. 
came back and poured it aU inco

stem . After a second, thP. water

came flowing out from the 
drainage holes in the bottom, 
and spread slowly an over my 
desk and onto the papers that 
were still on it. I snatched it up 
from my desk , still spilling water 
and ran about the room 
searching for a safe place to put 
him. 

"Fine, bastard," I said. not 
being able to find any drainage 
pipes handy. "Piss on me, like 
everybody else." I held him over 
my head , and the streams 
slithered OntO my head. through 
my hair and down my back. 

I took him into the bathroom, 
put him in the sink, and poured 
more water into him, slowly this 
time, and only a little bit came 
out through the lower sluices. 
Then I rinsed out the mug, filled 
it full of water, and held it up to 
the light. Clear, it was, and very 
beautiful, with the light shining 
through it. Perfect, in a way. I 
understood how a plant must 
feel as I took a long, steady, crisp 
drink, and drained the mug 
completely. 

I have kept my promise to 
Phil, basically. We've been 
through rough times together. I 
managed to survive that finals 
week. and many more since . I 
had to change his pot three 
times. and he's got a whole forest 
of stems. His leaves are growing 
slender. but healthy. and are 
growing stronger all the time. 
Everytime I see a new one

I don't need to go home anymore,

Cagers endure long, lost weekend 
By MATI L\IT, scaffWnter 

T HE TRITONS went up nonh over the Thanksgiving 
holiday only to be thankful that 
they are not a Division I team. 
UCSD lost both games of the 
trip: first to Berkeley 88-46, and 
then 108-69 to Stanford. 

"We played atrociously against 
Berkeley," said coach Marshall. 
The team shot only 28 percent 
from the field and 36 percent 
from the line . "But we bounced 
back and were ready to play 
Stanford ." 

At Stanford, the Tritons hung 
tough for the first ten minU[es of 
play, staying within only 2 or 3 
points before the Cardinal 
opened a lead UCSD could never 
catch. 

"We executed much better 
against Stanford than we did 
against Berkeley, and that's the 
whole thing about playing 

Division 1 teams. If we can 
execU[e against these guys, then 
when we come back against 
Division III teams it should be a 
piece of cake," said Marshall. 

Marshall added that, "The 
score doesn't mean ariything to 
us other than our performance. 
You've got to figure that an upset 
against a Division I team is going 
to be tough." And because it is 
tough, he says they "must get the 
most they can out \If the 
experience." 

A player who received some 
good experience this trip was 
freshman Mark SU[herlin who 
staned in front of junior Bill 
Reese. "Bill hasn't been playing 
up to Bill Reese standards as of 
recently. He'll be okay, but Mark 
desired the Spot against Stanford. 
As far as our next game goes, it 
depends on the upcoming days 
of practice." 

This Thursday at 7:30 the 
Tritons play at home against 
USIU, another Division I team. 
Unlike the Stanford and Berkeley 
games, Marshall expects to win 
this game. 

The USIU team the Tritons 
face this year is much improved 
over \ast year's team. They are 
especially strong in the guard 
position . "USIU's guards can run 
and press extremely well," 
Marshall said. "Last year we 
killed them and that's not going 
to happen this year," he 
predicted. 

On Friday UCSD is home 
again to do battle against 
laVerne, a Division 111 team. The 
coach feels "there is no reason 
why we can't be 4-2 at the end 
of this week." 

The "Dash for Cash" is 
scheduled to occur at halftime in 
both of the games. ~ 

Women cagers open 
with tough loss 
By flIP HARRISON 

T HE TRITON women's basketball team lost it home opening 
game Tuesday against the Azusa-
Pacific Cougars in the first half. 
However, after halftime, which 
must have included a Knute 
Rockne-type speech from head 
coach Judy Malone, the squad 
came out and played inspired 
basketball to threaten the 
Cougars. Unable to recover from 
a disappointing first half, though , 
the Tritons' season opener 
resulted in a 62-45 loss. 

"We gave up in the first half," 
said Judy Malone, "You could see 
it in theIT eyes." Other 
indications included several 
defensive breakdowns and an 
overall lack of execution on 
offense. More than three 
uncontested lay-ups were missed 
within a two-minute period. 

Both these offensive and 
defensive letdown allowed a 
tough Cougar team to shoot 42 
percent while holding UCSD to a 
mere ~ 7 percent shooting in the 
first half. Azusa also out-
rebounded the Triton squad in 
the first half by a margin of 19-
14. 

Unstoppable was the Cougar 
duo of Denise Duncan, 23 
points, 16 rebounds; and Cindy 
DeDyoung, 22 points, 7 
rebounds, who combined 
proVided for over 70 percent of 
the opposing team's total points. 

The second period, however, 
brought out a Triton club with a 
completely different look and 
attitude. 'We decided at halftime 
we weren't going to be beaten in 
the second half like we were in 
the first. And I think we played 
them head-up in the second 
half," said Judy Malone. 

Much of the rejuvination came 
from junior Shanda Elzy, 10 
points, 7 rebounds, who showed 
excellent huStle and coun sense 
in the 'second half. Coach 
Malone called for a full-court 
press midway through the 
second half which momentarily 
fluStered the Azusa team. This 

allowed Elzy to pick off three 
mid-coun passes, subsequently 
turning them into easy lay-ups. 

Great effons also came from 
senior Lynne McLevie and 
Freshman Nadirah SCOtt 
McLevie , the Tritons' leading 
scorer and rebounder, nailed 
nine of her 13 points in the 
second half and grabbed nine 
rebounds for the game. 
Meanwhile, SCOtt came off the 
bench in the second half to 
inspire the team with her high 
energy play and quick pressure 
defense. 

This extra second half effon, 
although it enabled the Tritons 
to shoot 40 percent and keep 
even with the Cougars,still did 
not prOVide them with the 

~ictory they wanted. But all is 
not lost, according to coach 
Malone. 

"That's the toughest team we'll 
meet. We've got to look at this as 
a learning experience," she said. 
"This won't happen to us again 
this year. EspeciaUy with our 
presently injured players coming 
back." 

The "presently injured" liSt 
includes starterJennifer Gregory, 
potential staner Beth Copland 
and sopHbttrore Renee Davis. 
Jennifer Gregory, last year's 
leading rebounder and third 
leading scorer is out with a leg 
injury but is expected back 
sometime in the second week of 
December. 

Coach Malone is optimistic 
about the loss, however, and 
believes with the injured players 
coming back and a much easier 
Christ College game coming up, 
the leam should soon be in mid-
season form. "This was a good 
game for us; we played a very 
tough team and we didn't give 
up."

W1 RI; To W1 R1;;;11 ~~~ 
C OULD THE Stagg Bowl, the Super BOwl of Division III schools, be JUSt a touchdown away for UCSD? The answer to this question could 
very well be an affirmative one as the movement to 
bring a football team back to UCSD is beginning to 
sl;>iral upward. A grol.\P of students passed out a petition 
to present to the athletic depanmenr, showing that 
UCSD wanted their own footbaU team along with the 
no-luck chargers using Warren Field. Fifteen hundred 
signatures were acqUired within a matter of two days, 
and the athletic depanment, impressed by StUdent 
interest, began to look into the issue. 

"Right now we are in the process of reviewing the 
budgets of other schools to see what son of resources are 
needed to get the program off the ground," said UCSD 
Athletic Director Judy Sweet. 

In the meantime, the football movement is ttying to gain 

me needed groundswe~ trom the SUppOTt of the rest of the 
student body. "A footbaU team is like the front end ofa train 
in an athletic program and it irqects pride into a school," 
said Greg Dolge, a fervent supporter of this issue. "It's reaDy 
imponant that we get as many students as we can 
involved." 

Student enthusiasm for the athletic teams 
representing UCSD has been surprisingly vocal. 
Students and spectators jammed every nook and cranny 
available around Warren Field when the victorious 
soccer team met Claremont-Mudd in the Western 
Regional finals, mobbing the players when the final gun 
sounded, like a scene from the World Series. The crowd 
for the women's volleyball regional final in the Triton 
pit produced a deafening roar heard aU the way to 
Warren Village with each win. "It's been the best 
suppon I've ever seen from the students since I've been 

here," concurred Sweet. 
Sour Grapes or eomnion Sense? - Men's soccer coach 
Derek Armstrong, in view of his team's penalty kick loss in 
the quanerfinals of the NCAA championships, is reaming 
up with other soccer co~ches (most nOlably utlA's and 
Claremont Mudd's) to suggeSt to the NCAA soccer 
committee that the penalty kick fonnat be eliminated in 
play-off action. The Triton loss to Washington UniverSity 
came after 90 minutes of regulation play and twO lO-minute 
overtime periods. failed to see either ~am score the 
decisive goal. UCSD lost the penalty shootout, three goals 
to one. Armstrong'S initial suggestion thaf" the teams 
schedule an extr:a day in case of a tie score was termed 
"improbable" by.uCSD athletic director Judy Sweet. "There 
is too much of a cost factor involved with scheduling an 
extra day, pamcularly in regard to travel co~ts," s~ said.

Sweet did, however, concllr with Armstrong that some 

opnon other than the shootout should be adopted by the 
soccer commirree. "I suggested to coach Annstrong that he 
recommend chang~s based upon his knowledge of the 
game to the committee. "We'll back him as 'much as we 
can." 

One suggested format is the one used for the 
championship game itself The CM rulebook states that 
"Penalty kicks will nOt be a factor in the champIOnship 

game. Two lO-minute overtime periods shall be played. If 
the score is tied after the two ovenime periods, sudden 
death extra periods of 10 minutes each shall be played until 
a goat is scored or until environmental conditions force 
play to be terminated." Surely Other playoff games should 
adopt the format of this championship ganie?efore relying 
on the shoolOut to determme a WlOner. What s the sense in 
nOl trying to determine the best team based on stamina and 
conditioning, roo? The Washington University goalie 
SUCcinctly stated thar the shootout was merely a matter of 

luck. Whereas co-champions are declared after the 
environmemal conditions force a stoppage of play in the 
championship bout, the playoff structure should be similar, 
with a shootout occurring only after all other feasible 
avenues have been ex!1austed. We don't feel Armstrong is 
crying sour grapes, but is instead seeking to inject a little 
common sense into the playoff st ructure so [hat the best 
team - one that Incorporates condi tioning and stamina 
- emerges victorious.

This was a rematch of last year's AM final. 
The game was playe~ , in almost identical 
conditions to last year s game, rain and mud. 
These were ideal conditions {or Dan Walters 
and his crew of mudders. These guys were born 
to play in the mud. The only mudders I know of 
who are better live on a farm In a pen. The TKE's 
fell right imo the trap. Never race a mudder on a 
wet track. 

The game was no comest, as conscnsus All-
1M receivers (The Guardian E;r The Koala) Do~g 
Roche and Chris Ferrez scored al WIll. Sandy s 
line, lead by the "Rock,''' Steve FentreSs, 
dominated play over the hIghly regarded TKE

THISBUIrS 
FOR YOU: 

by mikel toombt 

A USTIN - "The only things cheap in this town," Donny Radcliffe is saying, "are gasoline, beer and entertainment. II 
Now, this situation would seem. dangerously 

conducive to' drlnkinl drivers, but fortunately for 
residents of Texas' capital city, the emphasis is quite 
often on the entertainment - and in particular, on the 
music, 

Austin is justly renowned for its musical tradition, for 
its country and honky-tonk and an on-eoing blues-rock 
scene that includes such names u Otis Rush, Buddy 
Guy, Stevie Ray Vauahan, the Fabulous Thunderblrda 
(featuring Stevie's brother Jimmy), Lonnie Mack and, u 
Radcliffe puts it, "all the kinp." (He isn't referring to 
the King Family, eit~er), The focal point for the genre is 
Antone's, a justly celebrated local landmark (the club 
commemorated its 10th anniversary earlier this year). 
Located to the north of UT (the 6O,()()()..student 
University of Texu) on The Drill (Guadalupe St.), 
Antone's has a apecial excitement that is IUlranteed by 
the highly visible presence of owner Clifford Antone, 

At the same time - and not far away, In the shadow of 
Austin's g10winl capitol building - there exists a 
remarkable rock 'n' roll renaissance, which has attracted 
the attention of both national publications and, of 
course, Hiatw. Ever on the lookout for modem musical 
meccas, Hiatw journeyed to Austin over the 
Hallowe'en/Diu de loe Muertos weekend (the biggest 
local holiday, it seems) when, besides witnessing the 
massive Hallowe'en madness on 6th St, - "no guns, no 
chainsaws" was about the only restriction the Austin PO 
could enforce - it found overwhelming proof of a 
happily happening scene. 

The initial evidence is provided at the State Theatre, a 
renovated movie house on Congress St, (downtown's 
main drag) that on Hallowe'en night is promising (but 
doesn't ultimately deliver) a l+band, 10 pm til-dawn 
marathon benefit, The theatre is staging the Fats Waller 
tribute Ain't Mi.sbehavin' on moet evenings, but that 
definitely isn't the theme tonight, as high spirits prevail 
and a midnight highlight is provided by Zeitgeist. 
Creators of a great debut album, Translate Slowly, this 
two-man, two-woman (for the moment, at leut) band 
has been much sought-after by record labels, Sadly -
thinking ahead, that is - this is probably the last chance 
to see Kim Longacre, the band's powerful singing 
counterpoint to John Croelin (tonight costumed, with 
much humor, as the Boss and singing a great version of 
"Atlantic City") and an embodiment of the rock 'n' roll 
"sway" that REM's Peter Buck is always talking about, 
who is quitting to concentrate on her 5OOn-to--be·born 
baby, 

After Zeitgeist, it's pretty much a downhill slide up the 
decibel meter, u an Increuingly abrasive procession of 
hardcore bands take the stage. Standing out among them 
is Scratch Acid, whose inspired attire - the members 
are straight out of Oz, with the (male) singer dressed 
(literally) u Dorothy - contributes to the band's noisy 
outrageousness. The ultimate low point, meanwhile, is 
achieved by the aptly-named Chaoe Crew, which closes 
down the show by exceeding the tolerance level of the 
mellow counter-culture types who seem to be overseeinl 
the theatre. 

The bands at the Hallowe'en marathon represent just 
part of the Austin rock scene, as local authority 
Radcliffe - sitting here at the blundy-named "Seis 
SallIS" Mexican restaurant, he authoritatively delivers a 
warning about the "Green Death .. condiment - points 
out. The number and variety of bands here, combined 
with the impressively healthy club scene - "I think 
there must be 50 live music clubs in Austin," he saya -
impressed Radcliffe immediately after he moved here 
from Atlanta: "In two weelca, I saw five bands that 
rivalled anythinl I'd seen in Atlanta." (Ironically, 
Atlanta now hu a burgeoning scene that rivals Austin's 
and that of its own neighbor, Athens,) 

The stren,th of Austin's scene is reflected in the 
excellence of the three bands Radcliffe hu worked with 
- Zeiqeist, Glass Eye and an amazing Western band 
with horn section (I) known u Dharma Burna - and the 
likes of True Believers, featuring brother of Alejandro 
and Javier Escovedo, aavier, when he led the punk band 
The Zeros, lived in Chula Vista,) 'The atmollphere also 
has an effect on visiting bands such II L.A.'s notable

bands' members stick up for the L.A. scene (illJlOring the 
fact that there are few million more potential fans than 
Austin's approximately 6(X),OOO population), with the 
Act's Jeff Davia ,ingling out X, the Blaatera, Loa Lohoa 
and (his favorites) the Minutemen. Still, at least after a

performances by the two banda (and by the Dharm

Greek to everyone 
by trish brown 

A good Greek restaurant can make you want to quit school and caU 
your local travel agent. Sipping retsina and nibbling dolmades can give 
you delusions of residing atop Mt. Olympus. If you're really susceptible, 
just listening to "Never on Sunday" brings out latent folk dancing 
tendencies, along with visions of sun-drenched villages of the islands that 
dot the blue Aegean. 

Warning: Aesop's Tables can bring on all the above symptoms. But if 
you're )Villing to risk a severe attack of Grecophilia, you'll find it worth 
your while. 

Aesop's Tables offers a large selection of Greek appetizers, entrees and 
desserts, all at reasonable prices. The emphasis is on freshness and 
authenticity. Everything they serve is prepared on the premises from the 
freshest ingredients available, usually locally-produced. 

Restaurants can show they appreciate your business with nice touches 
that cost them little but make a big difference in the enjoyment of a meal. 
Aesop's Tables serves a. small complimentary appetizer plate of qmot 
sticks, cucumber slices, Greek olives and peppers, with feta cheese 
dressing to dip them in. 

The-wine and beer list is extensive, offering a great many imported beers 
and wines at reasonable prices. 

YQU can make a meal of appetizers in the current Yuppie "grazing" style, 
dipping pita bread or veggies into hummos (garbanzo bean dip) or 
taramasalata (red caviar spread), munching on Greek olives and feta 
cheese, or relishing the spectacular flaming saganaki (made with Kasseri 
cheese). 

Or you can go all out, choosing an entree of moussaka (casserole of 
ground lamb and eggplant with bechamel sauce) or souvlaki (shisk-ka-
bob), with soup or salad. 

Since they make their own pastries, the dessert tray includes some 
Greek desserts that can't be found elsewhere in San Diego, as well as 
baklava which is as ubiquitous as it is delicious. Chocolate mousse and a 
Greek rice pudding round out the selections. 

Although it's newer-looking and much more spruced-up than any 
taverna in Greece I've visited, the restaurant still gives the feeling of 
Greece with its music, waiters in dark-blue Greek sailor caps, walls of 
photographs of Greek scenes and people and a sky-blue, scrubbed white, 
affable atmosphere. Service is fast, but, as in Greece, they won't rush you 
if you feel like lingering over dessert and coffee. 

Located at 8867 Villa La Jolla Drive, Aesop's Tables is open for lunch 
Monday through Sunday and for dinner nightly.

"Herman's Pizza ." 
So answers singer-songwriter 

Paul Westerberg of the 
Replacements when I phoned 
again after a bad connection. Had 
me wondering for a second. 

First question: Why the name 
Tim for their recently released 
fourth album? 

"Mainly to give people who do 
interviews something extra to 
ask." . 

An answer I should have 
expected. 

"There's no meaning at all," 
he continues. "We wanted 
something short. It'l sort of 
maybe a joke towards other 
bands that, y'know, give their 
album names with deep 
sijnificance and tricky titles and 
all this. We just wanted to UK 
something that was reslly, really 
simple and meant absolutely 
nothing. We wanted to give it a 
name too. People always asic, 
'What's the name of your new 
record?' 'Well, the record's 
called Tim.''' 

like the "name," the soop on 
Tim are simple and straiatlt-
forward with a satisfying quality 
of immediacy. The Replace-
menta could easily whip out their 
instruments and play their sonp, 
like a garage (basement) band 
come of age. The Replacements, 
composed of Paul (vocals,.guitar, 

NEED 
EXTRA 
INCOME? 

piano}, Chris Mars(drums), Bob 
Stinson (guitar) and Tommy 
Stinson (bass), play pure, 
unadorned mUlic. 

"I would call it amateurish, 
spirited pop or something like 
that," says Paul. "I mean rock 'n' 
roll is obvious. .. a lot of bands 
call themselves rock 'n' roll. I 
mean, we have the spirit of rock 
'n' roll more than mOlt bands. 
Our music doesn't always fall 
into that category but, y'know, 
the spirit that we do what we 
want and we're there to have fun 
and to please people rather than 
we're there to leU our new album 
and push our new product which 
is what a lot of bands do that call 
themselves rock 'n' roU." 

Tim is the firlt of their albums 
to come out on a major label, Sire 
Recorda. Hu this chan,ed the 
Replacements? "Everybody saY' 
that and sa far II I can tell, 
everything is pretty much the 
same. We did this last little tour 
(of the South) and I gueu people 
were expectirll thinas to be 
different and were let down 
whether It would be rnanaaers or 
whomever, but, y'know, nothlrll 
has really chaJlle(f for ua. They 
(Sire) haven't really promoted 
the band a whole lot, althoush I 
hear they're aonna ltart one of 
theee days! But II far sa like 
promotion and money and stuff,

that ham't really changed since a 
few years ago." 

All for their music, "It 
probably has (changed) a little. I 
think the way we went about 
recording it has changed just 
from the fact that we didn't go in 
there and really party this time, 
and that was of our own wanting, 
'cause we had done that before. 
We tried to go in there and 
capture the spirit of the live 
performance and it never really 
came off that way, so we figured 
we'd go in there and sort of 
subdy look at the necka of our 
guitars and play the instrumenta 
and see how it worked that way. 
And then we figured we always 
had the live show to do what we 
do there." 

The sonp on Tim are more 
Itreamlined than thOle of their

sure what that meana, says Paul, 
but it sort of sounded good to 
me.) and waiting to be forgotten, 
we are the sond of no one, 
baltards of young. " 

Tim is produced by ex-
Ramone drummer Tommy 
Erdelyi: "He's a real nice guy. 
He'l quiet and he's very 
professional, which probably has 
a lot to do with the less 'party' 
sound on the record, because we 
had never really worked with I 
producer. You know, on one 
hand it dampened the festivities, 
but it also got the job done, 
which was good I guess. But I 
think we'd probably worle with 
him again. I'm not sure, but we 
all like him enough on a personal 
level, so we had no problems at 
all." 

Twenty-five-year-old Paul 
recounts the story of how he 
came to be the singer for the 
Replacements in '79: "Well, 
there was this ad in the paper," 
he jokes. "The three of them had 
been playing in the basement-
Tom, BobbV and Chris-and I 
had been strolling by after work 
and I used to listen to them in the 

bushes~ 'cause they were like the 
loudest thing I had ever heard. 
You could hear 'em from a block 
away. After doing that for a few 
days, Chris had called me up at 
home and invited me over to 
come play guitar, and I came over 
and 10 and behold, that was the 
house that I had been listening to. 
It was scary. I was going ove 
there for fun and then all of a 
sudden it was the place that I was 
listening to and going, 'God if I 
could only go In there and see 

what they're doing.' It was great. 
"When I went over there, he 

(Tommy) was 13 and he had to 
like stand on a little stool to reach 
his amp practically. I mean, his 
amp was taller than he was. 

"What influenced us way back 
then was pretty much the simple 
sort of gJam rock that was the 
early '70.. The real flashy rock 
'n' foIl that was easy to play and 
pretty sNpid. It was frowned 
upon by most critics and stuff 
like that, y'know, Slade, Kiuand 
Sweet-easy sort of pop-
oriented rock 'n' roll." 

The Replacementa are the first 
group to record a Kiss cover, 
"Black Diamond" on Let It Be. 
"We still do that. That one's 
always fun. It's funny thata lot of 
kids don't even Ienow that it's 
Kiss though." 

Currendy, "I like these guys 
called Dave Kusworth and Nileki 
Sudden. In England they're sort 
of an acoustic duo. I've been sort 
of really into them so I think. 
maybe that some of the songs on 
the last record were probably due 
to listening to them like to Here 
Comes a Regular" or maybe 
"Swingin' Party" or something 
lilee that. 

"The band from Alabama 
called Carnival of Seasons, it's 
funny, because they sort of 
sound like us. We've played with 
them a few times and they've said 
that we were an influence on 
them and after hearing them, it 
sort of changes hands again 
because they're a really good 
band."

for being reckless, rowdy and 
disorganized during their 
performances. What's to be

Relaxin' at 'Camarillo Ihowa us 
the harsh reality of the Bird as he 
ltI'U8Iled .to ~nform to the rules 
of the state hospital, in order to 
be released. Nowadaya we would 
sav he was riaht~brain directed, 
but the hQlPitalstaff atruaIed to 
fit him Into a behavioral mold 
that would "Iurvive" the very 
pressures which had fOitered hil 

creative output. It was almOit u 
if they forelaw the .elf~ 
deatructive prOCell which would 
lOOn claim him. Playwriaht 
Charles Ruuell said "I think It'l 
a serious play, about a gifted 
musician, whOle issues are an 
artist alalnlt society, his 

treattnen~, the medical practices 
and the struggle to create." By 

settins the Bird in Camarillo, 
Russel has thrown these iaaues 
into a carnival lpotlight. 

Unfo~nately, acenes which 
are extremely short, almOit 
tableaux, being played on aataae 
with no curtain, create a kind of 
niahtrnare for set designers, 
actorl and director. 

Ron Ranlen, acenic designer, 

The new play at UCSD is a 
work In prolrell entitled 
Relaxin' at Camarillo, by Charlie 
Ruaaell. Directed by Michael 
Kantor, it premiered Tuelday 
night at the Warren Theatre to an 
audience of critics (LA. Tima_ 
well .. Guardian), drama majorl, 
department profellora, and 
otherl, nearly all of whom 
seemed to receive it well, j~Ri 
by their response. 

The play'. central character, 
Olarlie "the Bird" Parker, noted 
jazz aenius, died tragically at the 
Y9URII aae of ~, a pauper and 
heroin addict. The play is let 
durins Parker'l confinement at 
CamariUo state mental hOlPital, 
nearby Loa Anldea, in the late 
1940'.. Drama p-aduate John 
Wesley playa the character with 
wit and violence, malcinl the Bird 
leem clearly lilce a man 
pOllelled. Thankl to hil 
tenaative, powoerful portrayal, 
one can truly identify with this 
black artist Itryalins in a white, 
upti,ht society. 

Relaxin' over the 
Bird's nest 

scenes which could have 
obliterated an actor'l internal~ 
!zation of his /her role. Requirina 
playerl to carry props on and off 
I. did not help in this prOCell, 
yet lOme of them succeeded, 
notably Gloria Mann (al the 
elderly committee member 
Midge Neft), D.B.Novak (Dody 
Maxwell) and John Wesley 
(Bird). 

Some of the lOund worlca were 
quite effective, especially the 
patients calling offataae, At the 
beainning they were random 
nolle makers, but by the end they 
were chantiDi for the Bird co 
come out Into the patio and play 
hil .xophone. At the preview 
performance Tuesday nliht, the 
elecrric Ihock lOunds within an 
hallucination appeared to be off~ 
cue, and caused several aaorl' 
movements to seem outof lynch. 

Bird'. Iurreal rliht~hand man, 
Dody Maxwell, first appears in a 
drU8~haUucination, but returns 
in real life u a continual viaicor, 
and becomes like a door inward 
to Bird'i reality and outward to 
the world of freedom from which 
the Bird h .. been exiled aftu his 
nervous breakdown. In thil role 
of DodV, D.B.Novak displays an 
almoat extruensorv control of 
his bodv, and is once apin cast in 
a pa" which lives him the 
freedom to experiment with 
movement techniques. 

decided to place a table in center 
stale used in every acene, which 
worlca to unify the various 
acenea, becoming the center of 
the paychiatrist's office, the 
hOlpital committee conference 
table, a treatment table, an 
interview table and the focus of 
Dody and the Bird 'I vilitl. 
Beyond the staKe looml the 
suitablv arey inner walla of the 
hoapital. These walla frame the 
meeting place of inmates, 
become a place to pitch pennies 
ar, and are punctUred with 
institutional wire-alus windowa 
that hint ar freedom beyond, 
freedom which the state had 
taken from the Bird. 

UPtiRi desi8ner Brad Ballard 
used hancins lampa to draw out 
the acene of the hoapital, but 
otherwise was not too oriainal, 
mdendy preferrin8 to emphuiJe 
the blank lterility of hoapitallife 
by usins simple lighting. A 
notable exception to this 

~ty is the dim, lurreal 
lilhtlnl of the BIrd'1 
hallucinations and dreams. Total 
blackouts between all the acenea 
(there were lOme) would have 
been preferable to partial 
dimminl. eapecially lince n~t all 
the acton appeared to remain in 
character while entering and 
exibna· 

Coetumes were varied, rafllling 
from excellent hOlpital uniforms 
to creatively dressed hallud~ 
nations to DodY'I coo~ "hip" 
luits. The straightjacket in the 
belinning was shocking, a 
suitable baptism into the hOlPital 
experience. Some of the women 
appeared over-dreased, but.,then, 
It was the '..os. The COItumea 
were, on the whole, well desiped 
for the time of the play. 
Unfortunately, one actor, a 
patient, came onstaee wearIni a 
diptal watch, an anachronism 
which derracted IOrely from his 
excellent costume and arons. 

With regard to the text, it must 
be said that the playwright has 
made an ambitious attempt to lee 
into the mind of an ~t who is 
both troubled from within and 
without. A difficult challenge, 
but one which has been weU 
attempted and accompUahed, in 
sliahdV Iell than two hours 
playing time. 

Music richly embellishes the 
lubtext of the dialope. Director 
Kantor -ys, "Bird wu a leader 
of the ahamct jazz movement, 
and many younl musicians 
emulated his Style." The words 
and the music both come 
toaether In an explosion, even a 
fusion like the very melodic 
improvisations for which the 
Bird is remembered. It is hard to 
accept that a man of such 
creativity and power could have 
destroyed himself, but the play

Poetry made easy Mats 
by robin KOtt 

Have you ever heard poetry so 
infested with jargon that it 
sounds like the ritualistic tribal 
mutterinp of an obscure band of 
Austrailian aborigines? Have you 
ever heard poetry read in a tone 
of voice that resembles the white 
noise of the televison set you 
passed out in front of at -4 am? 
Have you ever attended a poetry 
reading where your own cry for 
mercy threatened to be the sole 
expression of passionate 
sentiment? If such has been your 
experience with poetry reading, 
the performance by Ivan E. Roth 
and Jill Fraser at San Diego 
State's Backdoor two Wednes-
days ago would have certainly 
registered as a pleasant surprise. 

As part of the Freeway 
Records-sponsored "Spoken 
Word" series, Roth and Fraser 
perfomred two pieces: Life is a 
Nown and Alphabetical Disorders. 
Both works are efforts to expand 
the boundaries of poetry by 
combining highly charged 
theatrical verse with synthesized 
electronic music. The collabor-
ation produces an explosive 
atmosphere that vacillates 

between humor and horror . 
Both Roth and Fraser express a 

concern over the public's present 
conception of poetry. In effect, 
the duo are trying to created 
something with a broader appeal. 
Their work is a movement away 
from the artist with, as Fraser 
puts it, " the ivory tower image." 

When asked what d is-
tinguishes their work from 
traditional poetry forms, Roth, 
whose influences include Hart 
Crane and Frank O'Hara, 
enthusiasticall y responded, "It's 
got music, life, breath, energy-
it stimulates, hopefully; it's 
thought provoking, it's got 
emotion, it's opened up . . . and 
ultimately more accessible." 

One thing is certain: Roth 's 
poetry is definitely not boring. In 
rapid-fire succession he delivers 
layers of succinct images that 
compound to create a startling 
and somewhat morbid "cinema-
scope," as suggested by this 
excerpt from "liqUid" (part of 
Life is a Noun): 
soft warm water of the hotel shower 
in Rosarito Beach made 
Japanese music as it dripped down

expect;d during their current 
tour? "As far as judging from the 
last couple of weeks, I don't 
think there's anything really 
changed. Before we went on tour, 
I was telling people that, 'Yeah, 
we're a little tighter now' and aU 
this but there was definitely a 
couple of shows on that little 
swing that turned, y'know, kind 
of sour. So I think there's still the 
possibility that we're still the 
same old Mats. That we can fall 
on our faces. Not that we go out 
and try to do that any more but 
there's still the chance that we 
may not put on a good show. 

"I'd say overall the aood 
shows were really good and the 
bad ones were fewer but the bad 
ones were... I mean the police 
were involved and things like 
that. That seems to be a trend on 
the trip, that a lot of police were 
showina up every time we'd play. 
And It made it a little 
uncomfortable, y'know, as far as 
the crowds getting unruly or the 
band doing whatever that 
irritated the authorities, but I 
forlee no problems in San 
Diego!"

fun to do that when people were 
a little more unexpecting, And it 
was fun to whip out these crazy 
covers. Now that a lot of people 
know that we can do 'em, it isn't 
quite as much fun to play "If I 
Only Had A Brain" and stuff 
'cause we've, y'know, kind of 
done that. Maybe we'll learn a 
few by the time we get there." 

With their seemingly 
nochalant attitude on stage, one 
wonders whether they do things 
to purposefully irritate the 
audience. "I think we 've 
probably grown out of that 
phase. But then apin, there are 
times where we just sort of do get 
under our audience's skin. Not 
nec:euarily by our own trying to, 
but there are times we can't quite 
Ft it up for the proper show and 
people will take that as we're 
trying to be rude or something. 
And a lot of people are mistaken 
but I auesa it's our own fault 
'cause over the yean we have 
been known to bait an audi~nce 
or whatever. 

"But I think people, if they 
have an open mind and if they 
know what to expect, which is 
pretty much anything, then 
they'll have a grand time. If they

come expecting us to play every 
song on every record of ours and 
play it perfect to the T, then we 
may have a little bit of trouble." 

Rumors have surfaced tbat the 
baas pla~ (Tommy) appean on 
sta8e without the benefit of 
clothing (i.e., naked). "Naked? 
No. Boy, wouldn't you love 
that?! His brother is the one that 
does that. He's done that a few 
times. I think he did that in San 
Diego, so .... He hasn't done that 
for a while. I think he did it in 
Boston about six months ilgo. I 
mean, that's another one of these 
things that as soon as people 
know about it and stuff, for him 
at least, it sort of takes the fun 
and the shock value out of it. I 
mean, he's got other things up his 
sleeves. You never know what 
he's going to do, but that is the 
truth-he has performed with ' 
,nothina but a smile and a guitar!" 

Their varied, eneraetic style 
would seem to appeal to different 
types of people. "It does, kind of. 
And that also gets us into a little 
trouble where we can't please 
everyone, y'know. And if We 
have a really bad niiht, we don't 
please anyone at all, because, I 
mean, someone wants to hear 
"Fuck School" and the people 
that want to hear that are usually 
the ones up front causing trouble 
for the guy who just wanted to 
hear the quiet "Within Your 
Reach" or "Swingin' Pany" or 
something. So it's an interesting 
mix sometimes."
