Faculty Board Carps 9n 
University Pay Rep'ort 

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

The board representing UC fac-
ulty is the latest to join in a long line 
of critics of VC President Robert C. 
Dynes over the coUege system's pay 
policies, especiaUy a new policy that 
gives Dynes the power to boost the 
salaries of top university executives. 

The plan, fmalized by the VC Board 
of Regents in January, put top-tier uni-
versity officials in broad salary ranges, 
and allows Dynes to adjust their pay 
without prior approval. Previously, the 
regents' approval wa requirer' <" grant 
salaries of more than $168,000. 

The UC Academic Council, the top 
committee of the university's faculty 
representative group, labeled the plan 
"flawed" in a resolution announced 
on Feb. 23, and caUed for the regents 
and Dynes to seek more consultation 
with academic councilrnembers before 

moving forward. 
"[We have] not been presented with 

evidence that increases in executive 
compensation ... beyond those received 
by aU other employees should be the 
highest priOrity use for limited re ourc-
es:' Stan Glantz, chair of the academic 
senate's subcommittee on planning and 
budget, stated in the resolution. 

The council was particularly con-
cerned with the way executives would 
be grouped in the pay plan. Regents put 
284 executives into pay cale based on 
an independent study conducted last 
year, which compared VC salaries to 
public ld private institutions as weD 

ivate industry. The scope of the 
stuoy was too narrow to be used in 
categorizing executive pay, according 
to the council's resolution. 

"The methodology should have 
also included, among VC's compari-
son groups, certain nonacademic iob 
categories; e.g, the managers of other 
public agencies in California state and 
federal government," the resolution 
stated. 

Suit Puts Future of Stem Cell Research on Rocks VC Regent Judith Hopkinson and VC Board of Regents Chairman Gerald 
L. Parsky touted the study in testi-
mony before state senators last month, 
and emphasized the report's findings, 

w~ ~cluded that compensation 
for VC administrators was about 15 
percent below the market: In response, 
the regents approved a plan, labeled 
RE-61, to bring all employee salaries 
within market levels in a decade. 

Tax ay~r grouRs_ 
claim that the $3 
billion initiative

Stem cell research in California is 
under attack from taxpayer groups 
attempting to stall the state's voter-
approved research initiative through 
the courts. 

The California Family Bioethics 
Council, one of the two plaintiffs 
in a lawsuit attempting to block the 
bonds, insisted in court hearings last 
week that the California Institute for 
Regenerative Medicine, which has 
the authority to dole out $3 billion in 
stern cell research funding over the 
next decade, lacks state control over 
the public funds. 

However, Robert Klein, chair-
man of the board that supervises 
the institute, stated in a press release 
that the state controUer has provided 
effective oversight since the birth of 
the organization. The University of 
California appoints five of the com-
mittee's 29 members, with the bulk 
appointed by dected state officials. 

So far, the stem cell agency has 
yet to grant any research funding 
because of its legal troubles. 

UCSD professor Larry Goldstein, 
who helped write the state proposi-
tion that created the agency, said 
that aU questions regarding the 
board's formation and finances were 
artSlftred with the approval of the 
initiative. The lawsuit, he said, was 
a special-interest effort by groups 
that is costing time and blocking the 
advance of research projects.

UCSD is a mqjor component of the statr', stem cell initiative, which is plagued b1l a new 
lawsuit alleging that the agency in choriJe of funding is unconstitutiontJi, 

"That argument was debated and has been slow, Goldstein said that 
lost during the election," Goldstein research and full fNeraJ approval of 
said of the objections brought forth stem cell ~ can take anywhere 
in the lawsuit. from five to 15 years. 

Ahhough stem cell research is 
in an "infancy stage" and progress [ lAWSUIT, page 2] 

Senators, however, were miffed 
by a serie of newspaper articles that 
exposed a trend of giving undisclosed 
compensation to executives and other 
employees, including $248,000 granted 
to Chancellor Marye Anne Fox in lieu 
of a sabbatical earned at her previ-
ous job. The study, they said, did not 
include those forms of compensation, 
and therefore couldn't be trusted to 
determine executive salaries. 

In its resolution, the council echoed 
the senators' sentiments. 

"VCOP [should] convey to the 
Senate the full table of salaries affected 
by RE-61, including ... deferred com-
pensation, special allowances and any 
other forms of compensation not avail-
able to aU other university employees:' 
the resolution stated. 

At a regents meeting in January, 
Hopkinson promised an "overhaul" of 
the university's pay practices. But' fac-
ulty leaders should be a large part of 
that renovation, according to Raymond 
RusseU, the chair of the senate's sub-
committee on faculty welfare. 

"If compensation offered to senior 
managers encourages a public percep-
tion that UC employees are overpaid," 
Russell said in VCFW's recommenda-
tions to the council, "that seriously 
undermines the university's ability to 
obtain the state funding needed to 
fulfill the regents' pledge to bring the 
salaries of VC employees up to market 
levels within the next 10 years."

New Chip Pumps 
Up Citrus Fruits 

A new chip that makes the devel-
opment of new citrus fruit varieties 
easier by determining the genes 
associated with, taste, acidic con-
tent and abi lity to resist disease has 
been developed by a UC Riverside-
led research team. Researchers will 
use the chip to study genetic traits 
pertinent to the c itrus industry, such 

as easier peeling, seedlessness and 
flavor components. 

The chip, which is made of a 
glass wafer covered by millions of 
strands of c itrus DNA, works when 
RNA, DNA's genetic complement, 
is purified from citrus tissue and 
washed over the chip inside a sma ll 
plastic case. The RNA then binds 
to corresponding DNA sequences 
o n the chip, allowi ng researchers 
to analyze genes found in specific 
fruits that could then be studied and 
applied to improving fruit quality. 

Stem Cell Case Could 
Drag On for Months 

• LAWSUIT, from page 1 
The initiative would make UCSD a 

hub of progressive research, according 
to Chancellor Marye Anne Fox. 

"It's safe to say that this new invest-
mem will advance stem cell research 
at UCSD and other UC campuses;' 
Fox stated in a press release when the 
initiative was passed in 2004. 

Critics, however, do not share the 
university's optimism. 

"Venture capitalists, private indus-
try - they're not going to fund some-
thing that has no promise:' Life Legal 
Defense Foundation Executive Director 
Dana Cody on the group's Web site. 
The Life Legal Foundation and the 
CFBC branded stem cell research a 
questionable practice. 

"We think it's not approved tech-
nology,' Cody said. 

The council also questioned the use 
of taxpayer money, which might not be 
spent for stem cell research but rather 
for whatever "vital research opportu-
nities" the board chooses to approve, 
according to the CFBC's Web site. 

Sdentists need to identify a good 
opportunity and follow it in the hopes 
of finding cures for people that die 
every day of diseases, Goldstein said. 

"We owe people a fair try,' he said. 
The case against the state agency 

could last anywhere from 12 to 18 
months.

Long-Term Fee Solution Not in Sight 
• FEES, from page 1 
increase:' LAO Director of Higher 
Education Steve Boilard said. "In 
the longer term, it might make a 
larger fee increase more likely in 
the future .» 

From 2000 to 2002, student 
fees increased 40 percent, follow-
ing seven consecutive years with 
reduced or flat fee levels in the 
199Os. Long periods of stagnant 
fees have set up the current situ-
ation, with students bearing the 
bruntoflarge fee increases, accord-
i ng to Boilard. 

UC Student Association 
President Anu Joshi blamed large 
student-fee hikes on the state's fis -
cal irresponsibility. 

"If the regents had increased 
fee.s during the late 1990s, tl)e 
dramatic fee increases earlier this 
decade would still have happened 
because the state was using student 
fees to back-fill its own budget ,» 
Joshi said. 

The LAO's analysis also stated 
that the student-fee buyout would 
violate Schwarzenegger's 2004 bud-
get compact with the university. 

Under the compact. student 
fees would increase by no more 
than 10 percent annually over a 
three-year period. It also called for 
a 14-percent increase in 2004-05, 
followed by an 8-percent increase 
in 2005-06 and 2006-07 . 

"The compact clearly calls for 
fee increases;' Boilard said. "The 
only exceptions .. . are that UC can 
raise fees even higher if state sup-
port fails . There is no provision fo r 
not doing a fee increa e.» 

State Department of Finance 
spokesman H .D. Palmer disagreed, 
and defended the governor's buy-
out. 

Because the state's growing 
economy has brought unexpectedly 
high tax revenue, Schwarzenegger 
decided to provide a "financial 
release for students:' Palmer said . 

The LAO suggested a share-
of-cost fee policy next year, under 
which students or families would 
pay a set percentage of the cost of 
their education, allowing only for 
a 3.5-percent fee increase due to 
inflation and increased costs. 

The LAO's proposal would pro-
vide predictability within fee levels 
over time and fair treatment of 
students, Boilard said. 

The university and UCSA ques-
tioned the ability of the state to 

~d be unpopular 
to aSk students to pay 
a little more next year, 
but I think that would 

be a more sound 
response in the 

longtenn?' 
- Steve Boilard, Director of 

Higher Education, Legislative 
Analyst's Office 

pay its share of education costs, 
according to UC spokesman Brad 
Hayward. 

However, students should not 
be forced to absorb the state's fund -
ing deficiencies, Boilard said . 

"I find it odd logic to say that 
when the state - with a $125 bil-
lion budget - can't meet its share, 
then stud ents should be forced to 
make up the difference; Boilard 
said . "Fees are the way for students 
to pay their fair share of their edu-
cation. They should not be treated 
as a limitless reservoir of money 
from which the state can balance 
its budget:' 

According to Joshi , students 
want a fee policy based on what 

families can afford to pay, not on 
the cost ofinstruction; however, the 
governors current compact, which 
is based on per capita income, is 
not satisfactory either. 

"The 'current fees at UC are not 
affordable to California families, 
which makes this entire agreement 
a moot point," Joshi said. "The 
current administration's compact 
does not take into account the 
unmanageable hours students are 
forced to work, the unmanageable 
amount of debt students and par-
ents are forced to take on, or the 
current fee levels before deciding 
decisions of the future ." '" 

The university and UCSA both 
embrace the governors buyout, 
despite LAO's criticisms. 

"Fees have gone up dramatical-
ly over the last few years;' Hayward 
said . "The governor has proposed a 
pause for the coming year, and we 
think that is reasonable ... to give 
students and their families a break 
from the steep inc reases that have 
occurred." 

While the governor's buyout may 
provide a pause of relief, a long-term 
solution is still out of sight. 

Boilard said that even if the 
buyout is approved by legislators, 
the universi ty still doesn't have 
what it needs: a firm policy for 
future fee changes. 

"It could be unpopular to ask 
students to pay a little more next 
year, but I think that would be a 
more sound response in the long 
term;' Boilard said. "Unfortunately, 
in an election year, it's much more 
difficult to take a long-term view." 

"It was a straight policy call 
by the governor," Palmer said. 
"[LAO] has laid out their opinion 
and the governor has made his. 
The Legislature now has the fi nal 
decision."

The Politics 
of Student 

Satisfaction 
Many - including writ -ers for this paper - have sung the praises of this fall's 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Salisfaction report, and its prom-
ise for improving the life of UCSD 
srudents. Pity that so much fuss has 
been made over a document so meth-
odologically flawed. 

For those stiU unacquainted with 
the study, the document was written 
by a committee tasked with fmding out 
essentially why !-,CSD seems to suck 
more than other UC campuses. The 
hope was that these defects would be 
fIXed after they were identified. 

From the start, the committee faced 
key design decisions: Optimally, given 
an unlimited budget and deadline, it 
would have drawn a random sample of 
srudents - statistically similar to the 
rest of campus - and gone from there. 
Alas, this was not the case. Instead 

Hats 
Off 

Vladimir Kogan 
vkogan@ucsd.edu 

of systematic, valid measurements, 
the committee opted to create what 
is essentially a coUection of anecdotes 
(which the committee itself admits on 
page eight). In its own words: "The 
committee felt that personal interviews 
offer insights with a depth and rich-
ness that no check-box questionnaire 
could easily uncover. Each srudent and 
each student group we talked with had 
stories to tell, and each one of those 
stories reflected a personal experience 
and a personal vieW.' . 

As amusing as personal experi -
ences and views may be to read, they 
unfortunately do little to idenlify insti-
rutional and systematic flaws. 

The design problems also greatly 
limit the usability of the report's con-
elusions. Consider, for example, the 
portion identifying "communities for 
whom campus life has great potential 
for improvement:" ethnic groups; com-
muters; transfers; athletes and Greeks. 

Now look at the special interests 
that dominated the pool of students 
interviewed in the process of prepar-
ing the report (listed in Appendix 
C): Cross-Cultural Center, Transfer 
Student Advisory Board, Triton Athletic 
Council, PanheUenic Association and 
the Inter-Fraternity Council 

Similarities? Indeed, if the campus' 
lesbian vegetarians organized into a 
registered student org, and if the org 
had met with the report's authors, IiI 
wager good money that they would 
also be listed as such a "community." 

Which highlights the problem: Did 
the committee recommend greater 
funding for athletics because this is 
indeed an important issue, or simply 
because the Triton Athletic Council 
had an opportunity to catch its ear? 
Other similar questions abound. 

Admittedly, the report does a mar-
velous job documenting the dissatis-
faction of UCSD students. Where it 
fails is in prOviding a Similarly rigorous 
analysis of what to do about it. 

In key areas, the report seems to be 
particularly vague - to say the least. At 
one point, the report recounts a scene 
in wh ich a professor, in the process of 
handing out the Course and Professor 
Evaluations, teUs students that their 
"comments were irrelevant because I 
bring in too much to the campus in 
research grants." The report concludes, 
rather philosophically: "Whether this

Neither liberals 
nor conservatives __ 
seem cap~-::--'--
thinking of 
minorities as 
more than a 
faceless demographic 

By David Cerutti 
STAFF WRITER 

I n celebration of Get-That-Black-Vote month, the Republican party has begun its push to reach out to black voters nationwide by char-
acterizing Democrats as racist and recalling its 
historic role as the liberators of slaves in the Civil 
War era. Even our local California Review did its 
part to break down the racial barriers that have 
kept bLacks and Hispanics from reaching their 
full potential. Sadly, the conservative overtures for 
minorities to escape a liberal victimization trap 
rest squarely on maintaining the notion that these 
people are victims, when they are long overdue for 
emancipation. 

Distrust of the government is a proven tool that 
Republicans have used to successfuUy muster votes 
from a number of unlikely demographics, most 
recently blacks and Hispanics. It shouldn't work, 
and not simply because the equation of social pro-
grams with slavery are clearly problematic. For the 
sake of the nation's poor, who currently comprise 
a large portion of the nation's black and Hispanic 
minorities, the Republican drive must fail. 

Many of the social institutions tbat poor 
minorities depend on are acrually being attacked 
as racist programs. Mason Weaver, a conserva-
tive black pundit, joins Star Parker, founder and 
president of the Coalition on Urban Renewal and 
Education, and Stanford business school professor 
Thomas SoweU, in decrying the welfare state that 
they claim has left blacks dependent on govern-
ment, their new "plantation master." 

A year ago, in his daring, comprehensive push 
to take Social Security off the backs of poor, 
hard-working Americans, President George W. 
Bush sloppily argued that Social Security hurts 
blacks and Hispanics, who don't live long enough 
to collect aU the benefits they paid into the sys-
tem. The core of that canard was a 1998 study 
by the Heritage Foundation, which was quickly 
impugned for its unscrupulous accounting, and 
the fact that blacks' life expectancy is lowered by 
high infant mortality, not because elderly blacks 
are any less bealthy than whites. In reality, as a 
joint demographic, blacks and Hispanics do weU 
with Social Security benefits, because the benefits 
are weighted toward people who haven't earned as 
much throughout their careers. That these minori-
tie are generally poorer than other demographics 
is a pre ent-day circumstance, based on history. As 
Paul Krugman of the New York Times pOinted out, 
to ask blacks to oppose Social Security on such 
grounds also presupposes that over the coming 

decades black Americans will continue to suffer 
the same income inequality and child mortality as 
they do today. 

For all its articles lamenting racism, the 
California Review does not cover the visceral issue 
of black infant mortality (1.5 percent as opposed 
to whites' 0.7 percent, as reported by the Center 
for Disease Control). Pundits like Weaver com-
plain that low expectations keep blacks down, but 
when the infant mortality of your demographic is 
as high as Panama's, the pedestal of public sorrow 
is nothing like a clean and ready maternity ward. 

National health care; perhaps in the form of 
insuring everyone under the age of 30 for regular 
physicals, basic maternity care, vaccinations and 
broken bones, would save thousands of black 
babies every year and generally improve the health 
of children in low-income families, helping them 
be more productive later. To be fair, it's not just 
Republicans, but a deeply ingrained, anti -govern-
ment culture that prevents America from creating 
social institutions that are basic in most other 
developed countries. 

Nevertheless, the Republicans have surely 
known the negative consequences of the tax poli-
cies they've implemented over the past five years 
on minorities, especially those living in particularly 
poverty-stricken states from Florida to Louisiana. 
Mere cuts in programs such as Medicaid will not 
close the budget gap they have created. It's difficult 
to say if personal feelings of racism motivated any 
portion of the tax cuts (and hence, the budget 
cuts), but it is certain that the net effect of recent 
Republican policy will be to reduce and eliminate 
programs that poor minorities depend on more 
than any other demographic. 

The Republican response to such criticism is 
to lump it with coarse accusations of party racism, 
against which they can present many Republicans 
who are not racist, or as "class warfare; which 
they know will elicit PavlOvian, anti-communist 
responses. But America built its prestige on being 
more than "not bad:' 

The Republican Party has done a masterful 
job of c~nscripting minority pundits over the past 
decade, but that's been the entirety of their policy. 
Meanwhile, aU they've accomplished is eroding or 
imperiling liberal programs that conflict with their 
economic ideology, such as socialized medicine 
and public pensions. Minorities will have to decide 
whether they want to be governed by sophists who 
are not overtly racist or legislators who will actu-
ally serve them. 

Just as nodding at black people won't cut their 
infant mortality in half and shaking hands with 

~-----

JENNIfER H5U /CU"RDI"N 

Hispanics won't secure their retirements, bash-
inS Republicans won't bring about social equality. 
National health insurance and pension systems are 
good for America as a whole; they just happen to 
be lspecially good for poor minorities. 

To be sure, safety nets cut out for particular 
minorities are not much different in principle than 
drinking fountains deSignated for colored people, 
despite the \'astly different intentions behind such 
policies. Such is the case with affirmative action 
programs, and the Republican Party has been right 
in opposing those. 

In the absence of such programs, the funda-
mental problem remains that America does not 
provide a level playing field, even in terms of 
basic bealth care. The way to level it is to build a 
government that prevents debilitating problems, 
such as catastrophic illness or an elderly ball-and-
chain, from afflicting its citizens. After that, as 
Republicans have said in deed if not in speech, 
"You're on your own." 

Unfortunately, some of the nation's most promi-
nent minority leaders have failed to embrace the 
idea that their constituents must not make victims 
of themselves, but should demand universal gov-
ernment services that they in particular would ben-
efit from. Bernice King, daughter of the great civil 
rights leader, has stood in the way of transforming 
Atlanta's ailing King Center from a tourist attrac-
tion that holds her father's tomb into a think tank 
that gives life to his ideals. Notably, she cites distrust 
of the government, which already runs most of the 
other memorials to her late father, as a reason not to 
rum the center over to the Park Service. 

King's stubbornness bears striking similarity 
to the bling and rims that adorn todars minority 
culture. Image is important, substance secondary. 
Her platitudinous speeches contain an image of 
victimization and an utter lack offuture direction . 
It's why the Republican message of "government 
equals master," despite the party's lack of posi-
tive achievements or plans for the integration of 
minorities, is so appealing. 

Fifty years ago, the Democratic and Republican 
parties swapped the black and segregationist 
votes (it's the biggest elephant in the room when 
Republican pundits get together to talk about how 
racist the Democrats are). Today, Republicans 
claim to be inviting blacks into a new era of free-
dom and equality based on the principle that they 
are the victims of programs that help not only 
them, but Americans in general. America's blacks 
and Hispanics must eschew their victimhood, or 
forever fmd themselves the object of February's 
Califonaia Review.

this represents the common percep-
tion among students." 

Well, shouldn't the committee have 
actua1Iy investigated whether the story 
is accurate, and whether C.A.P.E. scores 
do matter? Indeed, the report Iabe1s 
the perception that faculty care more 
about their research than teaching as 
likdy another such "urban myth." 

However, had the committee taken 
the time to review the university's 
Academic Personnel Manual - in 
particular section 667 - it would have 
found that professors often receive 
"additional" compensation for bringing 
in outside research grants, which may 
explain why they would value research 
over instruction. Nowhere, though, 
does the report address the university's 
compensation system, or consider the 
perverse incentives it creates, though 
it does devote half a page to students 
complaining about their "Nazi-like" 
residential security officers. 

At the end, the study is a political 
document, doing more to chronicle 
the political demands of the self-inter-
ested student groups that participated 
in its creation than the needs of the 
average ,tudent. It does little to go 
beyond the campus college council 
(the other major contributors) to rep-
resent the views of the more than 80 
percent of students who don't bother 
voting in campus elections. 

Do students who don't give a rat's 
behind about sports, who don't attend 
A.S. Council meetings and who aren't 
members of Pi Kappa Alpba really 
believe that what ails the university 
is the absence of a "coUege village" on 
campus (the creation of which is the 
committee's main recommendation)? 

The report never tells us.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR-----,----------
Column Misunderstands 
Underlying Gender Issues 
Dear EdItor: 

I agree with Natasha Naraghi's 
assertion that "blaming men for 
gender inequalities" is a poor and 
ineffective use of feminists' energy. 
1 do not, however, agree with her 
statement that gender disparity is 
"less problematic than the constant 
tug between family and work." To 
say that this is the only gender prob-
lem society faces today is a gross 
simplification. Her article implicitly 
reveals several problematic assump-
tions. 

Regarding the 23 percent gap 
between men's and women's wages, 
she claims that "time will likely 
resolve these discrepancies as it has 
with education differences:' This 
statement ignores the struggle of 
women who petitioned and fought 
to be accepted into all -male univer-
sities and male-dominated fields, 
first as students, and later as educa-
tors. This change was not the result 
of the passage of time but rather of 
a concerted effort to combat gender 
ineqUality. Furthermore, to speak of 
this problem as a thing of the past is 
to obscure the ways in which it con-
tinues today. Yes, women are admit-
ted to universities, and yes, they're 
graduating, but how many of them 
are going into engineering? How 
many of them are professors in the 
computer science department? 

The other thing Naraghi assumes 
is that the tension between fam-
ily and work is somehow a strictly 
female problem. She suggests that 
women may have difficulty plan-
ning their graduate careers "know-
ing they may only work for roughly . 
five years before settling down to 
have children." Presumably there are 
men helping to produce these chil-
dren, yet their careers are mysteri-

ously not threatened by the need to 
"settle down." She says that "children 
in daycare with working mothers 
are likely to suffer most." This state-
ment presumes the chilQ is in day-
care because the father is also work-
ing, yet specifically places the blame 
upon working "mothers." She does 
not acknowledge the possibility of 
mothers working while "dads" stay 

cover of Rolling Stone, with Kanye 
West portrayed as Jesus. Shocking? 
Yes. Offensive? Sure. I don't recall 
there being any riots and deaths 
worldwide over it, though. The 
truth is, the whole point of freedom 
of speech is that it can dash with 
anyone's values. Jews have to put 
up with neo-Nazis and Christians 
have to put up with Piss Christ. It's

complex than Naraghi admits. It is 
not men who oppress women, but 
rather the assumptions and expecta-

Muslim Misunderstands 
the First Amendment 

Dear Editor: 
I suggest Farhad look at the recent 

once. 
Farhad Noorzay, a member of 

the Muslim Student Association at 
UCSD, requests that freedom of 
speech be "modified" and in doing 
so shows his restrictive and dis-
torted view of what freedom is. 
Conditional freedom is not free-
dom at aU. 

Noorzay's commentary asks that 
freedom of speech be "altered" so it 
does not clash with the Muslim value 
of honoring Prophet Mohammed. 
He focuses on an alleged Western 
double standard to protect the val-
ues of other religions but not those 
of Islam, arguing, "Islamic values 
are just as important as any other 
religion's values; therefore, they 

should be dealt with in the same 
manner:' I argue that they already 
are . 

How many times have there 
been' controversial or caricatured 
depictions of Christian or Jewish 
religious symbols in both Western 
and Muslim countries? Freedom of 
speech protects the right to express 
views that are unpopular and contro-
versial. Modifying its applications so 
feelings don't get hurt is absurd and 
puts freedom of speech on a slippery 
slope to censorship. Noorzay asks for 
action, not apologies. I don't think 
either is appropriate. 

There is considera6 e hypocrisy 
in demanding that the West refrain 
from any criticism of Islam while in 
Muslim countries there is regular 
ridicule and parody of Jews and 
Christians and their religious val-
ues. Additionally, Noorzay does not 
understand how it is possible to 
defend the existence of a cartoon 
while at the same time disagree 
with its content. The provocative 
Danish cartoons are not represen-
tative of my views on Islam. They 
are, however, representative of what 
need s to be protected under the 
true concept of freedom of speech.

Students in trouble at UCSD don't know they 
can find help from a key source: their peers. 

By Vladimir Kogan 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

hen campus 
administrators 
charged John 
Muir College 
alumnus Bryan 

Barton with violations of the stu-
dent conduct code stemming from 
his failed bid to take control of the 
student government in a coup nearly 
two years ago, he turned to a more 
democratic institution to make his 
defense: an independent judiciary. 
Barton maintains he was se rious, bUI 
few fear the former Koala editor for 
hi autocratic tendencies. 

However, Barton was an anom-
aly. Every year, the univer ity's tu-
dent conduct coordinator processe 
approximalely 2.000 alleged nonaca -
demic conduct violations - one for 
every 12.5 students, though some are 
by repeal offenders; nearly all get set-
tled informally between the studen ts 
and Ih" deam, and few ever bother 10 
ta ke their case 10 one of the campus' 

IX , ludent judicial board •. 
"It', a big problem," Earl Warren 

College Judicial Board Chair Ryan 
Raam ,aid . "A lot of .Iuden ts arc 
somel imes discouraged - not by 
thc dcans, not by Ihe adlllinbtra -
tion - because of lhe length f Ihe 
process. because of the bureaucracy. 
A lot of ti mes, students just want a 
quick rcsolution, and they'll take a 
sanction from the dean." 

, . I I 

In the UC system, each campus 
has its own scheme for discerning 
the guilt of students accused of mis-
conduct. What makes UCSD unusu-
al, compared to most other campuses 
across the nation, is that the judicial 
bod ies maki ng these decisions are 
made up exclUSively of students. 

"The courts in California, as all of 
the states. by and large defer to col-
leges and universities to establish a 
system that adjudicates misconduct, 
and they imposed very large gener-
ic standards of due process:' acting 
Student Policie and Judicial Affairs 
Director Anthony Valladolid said . 
"Essentially, it's about fairness ." 

At UCLA, a special committee of 
students and four faculty members 
- "at least two of whom shall have 
training in the law or experience or 
arbit ration of dispute :. according to 
campus policies - meet to rule 011 
cases brought by uni versity deans; 
in UCSU's system, hearings before a 
panel of peers is what Vall adolid ca lls 
an "absolute right :' 

An in formal poll of the nation's 
top universitic in 2000 conducted by 
the Dar/lllolIlIl. the student paper at 
Dartmoulh College, found thai mosl 
colleges allow students to playa role 
in campus judi ial bodies, though 
that respomibility is usually shared 
with faculty, staff and administra-
tors. At Harvard niversity, it found 
that not a single student salon the 
judicial hoard . 

Though dean at some of UCSD's 

colleges are involved in appointing 
students to the boards, most of those 
active in the system agree that they 
function with an unprecedented 
degree of independence. At John 
Muir College, the student affai rs 
dean is not permitted to sit in on the 
hearings, and at Thurgood Marshall 
College, new judicial board members 
are elected by current ones. 

"I would say that having a jury 
of your peers is more authentic in 
college than it is in the real world, 
because these really are your peers;' 
John Muir College Judicial Board 
Chair John Perry said. "I think ii's 
important to be able to offer students 
this trial system ." 

Over the past two years. Perry's 
board has ruled on everything from 
the Barton case to allegations of theft 
from Sier ra Summit and alcohol 
write-ups. By and large, though, few 
students lake their cases to Ihe pan-
els: Raam's board hasn't met ince Ihe 
la I academ ic year.

of the meeting I aid, QWhy were we 
invited here? We're not Republican, we 
didn't vote for you, we didn't vote for 
you in 2000, we're not going 10 vote for 
you in 2004:' He said, " It's not about 
polities, mom." 

And then at the Republican 
National Convention, he starled talk-
ing about how he meet with the 
families and how they say, "I'm pray-
ing for you, keep the mission going." 
And that's when I said, "Oh my god, 
that's the only reason why you met 
with u . It was about politics." 

G: What do you think would be the 
best cour e of action to end the war in 
Iraq amidst the political chao? 

S: I think we have 10 order Ihe 
generals to bring the troops home. Get 
our troops OUI of there as swiftly and 
safely as possible. We have 10 put in 
peacekeepers if the Iraqi people want 
them but not the Americans or British 
because they wear the uniforms of 
oppressors. No guns, ju t people going

that George Bush and his policie have

especially with an Arabic face, and 
don't abandon the people of Iraq. Give 
them money for reparations but not 
money for killing. 

G: How do you respond to the 
parent of fa llen soldiers who believe 
that your protests are demoralizing 
the troops? 

S: I know for a fact that I hear 
from dozens and dozens of oIdiers 
that being in Iraq for no reason

MONDAY, MARCH 6, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Judicial Boards Go Stale With Disuse 
• J·BOARD, from page 6 
(the admission cannot be used as 
evidence against them). 

Until quite recently, the univer-
sity allowed students to hire actual 
attorneys to represent them before 
the boards. though administrators 
changed the policy to forbid them 
from asking questions after a particu-
larly contentious case several years 
ago. 

The process, however, differs 
markedly from the authentic judicial 
system: In criminal court. prosecu-
tors must prove their case beyond 
a reasonable doubt; at UCSD (and 
many other universities), they must 
do so merely by a ·preponderance" 
of the evidence. showing that guilt is 
simply more likely than innocence. 

"The burden of proof is danger-
ously low," Silva stated in an e-mail. 
"When it's a ca .... e of he-said-she-said, 
a lot of students lose even though 
there's not really any evidence against 
them. it's illogical that students can 
be expelled from the university 
when there's no real evidence against 
them." 

Board chairs and Valladolid, 

though, defend the more relaxed 
standard. 

"In a criminal case ... there is a 
potential for a loss of liberty and, 
potentially, in a capital case, for a 
loss of life," Valladolid said. "When 
you're dealing on that magnitude, 
the standard has to be very high. 
Preponderance of the evidence does 
two things: It recognizes that the 
punishment is much reduced, and it 
recognizes that you will not have the 
complexities in the system that does 
the adjudication." 

In addition. though the judicial 
boards' discretion over guilt is abso-
lute. they have little control over 
sanctions, which are determined later 
by the college deans. The separation. 
VaUadolid argues, provides a more 
equitable outcome, allOWing the 
boards to hear the facts of the case 
without being prejudiced by things 
like prior offenses, which are consid-
ered separately by the deans. 

"No system established or con-
structed by human beings will be 
perfect; said Vic Merjanian. chair 
of the Thurgood Marshall College 
Judicial Board. "But the system we 

have on campus is as close to perfect 
as [ think we can get ... . It really is 
fair to every person involved in the 
''Ystem." 

However, even Merjanian admits 
there could be improvements, espe-
cially in expanding student awareness 
and allowing the six college judicial 
boards to work more closely together. 
None of the chairs interviewed for 
this story, for example, knew the 
identity of his equivalent in the other 
colleges, or had any knowledge about 
how the other boards function. 

For Barton, the judiCial board 
system failed; he maintains that the 
students on the body hearing his case 
were merely "tools of the administra-
tion:' After being found guilty by the 
Muir College board, he appealed to 
the college's provost, who upheld the 
conviction . 

"What I got is that they were really 
new students that lived on campus; 
he said. "And I got the feeling that they 
were very cozy with the dean:' 

Overall, there are few document-
ed complaints about the system. But 
that may be because so few students 
actually use it. 

Sheehan Demands Peace During Protest 
• WAR, from page 7 
tell me they're too busy to really think 
about it. So I think sending them to 
fight and die and kill innocent people 
is demoralizing. Seventy-two percent 
of the soldiers want to come home, 
and 90 percent st ill think we're in 
there for revenge of 9/11. 

G: How did the media affect you 
and the movement against the war? 

s: There were a lot of people in 
middle America who didn't even know 
we had a peace movement but were 
against the war and against the presi-
drnt. People around the world real-
ized that there Wall a very active and 
relevant peace movement in America. 

Other times it's very disappointing. 
like at the rally in Washington. D.C., 
where we had at least 500.000 - and 
the media reported 100,000. Then 
they showed the counterprotesters. 
who were around 400. ]t seemed very 
one-sided. 

Of course, I've heard a lot of lies 
about me. Everybody who is for war 
focuses their attention on me like I'm 
the only one in the world that wants 
peace. So that was the negative effect 
of the media in Crawford - making 
me the story rather than the fact that 
our country is occupying another 
country for no reason. 

G: What is the political message 

that you wish to send to the college 
students of this generation? 

s: rm not too into the political 
end of it, but you just have to look 
inside yourself and figure out what you 
believe in and what you want to stand 
for. and stand for that. Always wake up 
every day, like I do and think. "What 
can I do today to make the world a 
better place?M And try to do that. If 
everybody does that. and everybody 
really believes that they can make a 
difference, then we<! have no more 
war. We<! have no more starvation, or 
poverty or environmental problems. 
And we really all have to do our part in 
society or we're not going to have one.

UCSD to NCAA Tournament

coach, with an impressive 69-54 win 
over Sonoma State on March 4, one 
day after dominating San Francisco 
State 94-55. The wins, the team's sev-
enth and eighth straight, closed out 
the Season on a high note as the play-
ers broke many team and individual 
records in the historic season. 

Junior guard Kim Buffum became 
the all-time three-point shooting lead-
er in U CSD history, reaching 161 total 
three-pointers on March 3 and sur-
passing the 1993-97 record by Cindy 
Yamasaki. Also. junior guard Leora 
Juster became the all-time scoring 
leader in UCSD women's basketball 
history when she earned 32 points 
against Sonoma State. Juster's fourth 
30-point game this year gave her 1,311 
points, surpassing Ali Ginn's previous 
record of 1,308. 

Jones was overjoyed at all of her 
pl:tyers' accomplishments, but empha-
sizes once agaiit an essential compo-
nent of any successful sports team: 
teamwork.

and finished the game with a game-
and career-high seven boards. "I was 
guarding their leading rebounder 
(junior center Oscar Edwards], so I 
was just trying to box him out and the 
ball kind of came to me." 

While the Galors and Tritons 
both struggled offenSively in the 
seco.nd half, the top-ranked UCSD 
defense kept San Francisco Stale 
without a field goal for the first 10 
minutes of the second half. 

"If you defend every night, you 
can win those games even when 
you don't shoot the ball well," head 
coach Bill Carr said. "Defensive play 
certainly saved [us I tonight." 

Despite its defensive effort, UCSD 
couldn't build a comfortable lead. 
With the Tritons in the midst of a six-
minute scoring drought, the Gators 
began to attack the weakened UCSD 
frontcourt, chopping the Triton lead 
to single digits with eight minutes, 23 
seconds left to play. 

"We got a little bit complacent; 
senior guard Odioh Odiye said. "We 
weren't really as aggressive as we 

should have been on offense:' 
The complacency allowed San 

Francisco State to climb within five 
points after two of Edwards' free 
throws. Then Odiye, the lone Triton 
senior, took control. Odiye converted 
a layup in traffic off freshman for-
ward Darryl Lawlor's assist. On the 
next possession, he drove the lane, 
drawing a foul and making one of 
his two shots from the line. After 
Hatch misfired on a jumper in the 
lane, it was Odiye who scooped up 
the rebound, drawing another foul 
and hitting another free throw to give 
UCSD a four-point cushion. 

"Odioh is a leader in every sense 
of the word:' Allard said. "He leads 
by example; he knows everything 
about the game. I've known him for 
a long time and [ respect how much 
he loves the game." 

With the Triton defense again 
stepping up and holding the Gators 
scoreless for the final two and a half 
minutes, Odiye grabbed another 
rebound and scored the game's final 
points from the line. 

"I wasn't having a great game, 

but I knew that if I kept trying 
and stayed aggressive, good things 
would happen." said Odiye, who fin -

i~hed the game with six points and 
two rebounds in 14 minutes of play. 
"I'm very happy that I came here ... 
to have been here to start something 
special. I think the program is going 
in a great direction:' 

San Francisco State's 38-point 
mark was another record for the 
Tritons, the fewest points UCSD has 
allowed in more than 13 years. 

"We're making history here." 
said Poppen, who led UCSD with 
a career-high 16 points. "It's a good 
feeling:' 

Lawlor added 10 points, seven 
rebounds, three assists, one block 
and two steals off the bench, while 
Hatch scored eight points with fou r 
rebounds and three assists. 

"[ couldn't have had a better 
time:' said Allard, who ended the 
season as the team leader in assists, 
rebounds and minute played. "I 
think we met expectations and we're 
just going to try and take it a tep up 
next year:' 

"Leora. Briana [Peters] and Kim all 
had individual records they broke, but 
I believe all of them would agree that 
the team success is far more impor-
tant than the individual achievements; 
Jones said. "Team chemistry can carry 
you further than any X's or O's." 

hard on their defense to generate 
points," Jones said. "Offense comes and 
goes, but defense can be there every 
night because it Icomesl from desire, 
hard work and team commitment." 

The players were committed to 
winning their last four games before 
playoffs, and with much sweat and 
determination, they achieved their 
short-term goal. After dosing out the 
season winning eight straight, the 
Tritons earned a No. 4 seed in the 
NCAA Division-II Tournament West 
Region and will face Seattle Pacific.

Team chemistry led to the Tritons' 

convincing win over the Gators. San 
Francisco State fell behind at the start 
of the game as UCSD jumped to a Hl 
lead that extended to 22 points by half-
time. The Gators never found a way to 
get back into the game as the Tritons 
pounded the ball by them for endless 
swoops of the basket, due much in 
part to Hillary Hansen's career-high 
21 points, 17 points from Juster and 
another IS from Michelle Osier. Osier 
also dished out seven boards, three 
steals. two assists and two blocks.

Although a top ranking is good for 
the team, Jones wants to make sure 
that her team maintains focus on a 
championship, not just an appearance 
and quick exit out of the tournament. 

"We do not want to approach it

OFFENSE 
ABSENT IN 
SOFTBALL'S 
WEEKEND 

By Lauren Kala • 
STAFF WRITER 

After traveling to Chico State only 
to have both of its games rained out, 
the UCSD softball team headed to f<tce 
Cal State Stanislaus in search of better 
weather and a chance to increase its 
four-game winning streak. 

However, the Tritons were unable 
to continue their run, dropping two 
games to the Warriors in Thrlock, 
Calif., on March 4. UCSD was shut 
out in a close 1-0 game in the first 
contest before suffering an 8-3 loss in 
the second. 

Game one swiftly turned into a 
pitchers' duel with only one run on 
nine hits for the two team combined. 

Sophomore ace Melissa Ward 
went head to head against al State 
Stanislaus pitcher Jessica Gaumnitz, 
who racked up five strikeouts to Ward's 
three. with Gaumnitz emerging as the 
victor. 

The only run was a solo homer in 
the second off of Ward. She dropped to 
8-3 on the season after her 10th com-
plete game in 11 starts. 

Though the Tritons have already 
accumulated 13 home runs this season, 
only five less than their season total in 
2005, their offense could not produce 
hits again t Gaumnitz. Sophomore 
Elizabeth Vasquez and seniors Desiree 
Franciscus and Niki Anderson 
accounted for the three UCSD hits in 
the game. 

Fueled by the lack of offensive 
action in game one, the Tritons started 
the second game swinging. The UCSD 
offense started strong, scoring twice in 
the first inning. In the bottom of the 
first, UCSD gave one run back before 
Stanislaus tied the score at two apiece 
in the second. The Warriors went on 
to score three in the fifth and three 
more in the sixth to bring the game 
out of reach. 

Senior Jenny Spencer went 2-for-
4 with two RBIs in the loss, while 
Vasquez contributed two hits. 

Sophomore pitcher Nicole 
Fullerton was charged with the 8-
3 loss and fell to 4-3 on the year. 
Fullerton allowed five runs on six hits 
in 4.2 innings on the mound. 

Ward came in to relieve Fullerton 
in the fourth inning, but was unable 
to stop the Warriors, who are pre-
dicted to finish fourth in the league 
this season. 

Prior to their March 4 doublehead-
er against Stanislaus, the Tritons led the 
all -time series 22-14. UCSD won the 
only other meeting against Stanislaus 
this season, beating the Warriors 9-6 
in the final game of the Best of the 
West Softball Classic in February. So 
far this season, the Warriors are 14-8 
and 3-3 in league play. 

Following this weekend's losses, 
the Tritons fall to 11 -8 overall and 
4-2 in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. The team, picked to 
finish sixth in the CCAA for 2006 in 
a preseason vote by the league's head 
coaches, had been on a four-game 
winning streak after sweeping con-
secutive doubleheaders against No. 9 
San Francisco State and Sonoma State 
last week. 

The two games against Chico 
State were called off due to inclem-
ent weather and will be rescheduled, 

'but the make-up date is yet to be 
announced. 

UCSD is back in action this week 
with a doubleheader at Cal State San 
Bernardino on March 8 and then 
returns home with another double-
header against Cal State Monterey 
Bay on March 11.

its regular season with the same

"Their work ethic, competitive

The UCSD men's volleyball team 
went on the road for two games, only 
to get swept again in both contests, 
this time to Cal State Northridge and 
UC Santa Barbara. 

On March 4, the Tritons failed 
to collect a win against another 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation

13 MPSF) while the No. 6 Matadors 
improved to 10-7 (6-6 MPSF). 

Senior outside hitter Jon Daze

sophomore middle blocker John 
Mark Wendler had a match-high six 
blocks. 

UCSD kept it dose in game one, 
even taking the lead several times. 
Northridge came out attacking to . 
capture a 5-8 lead, but the Tritons 
battled back to lead by one, 12-11, 
after a setter dump by junior setter 
Brooks Dierdorff. The Matadors soon 
recaptured the lead 13- 14 after an 
error by junior middle blocker Garret 
Smith. UCSD would not go away 
and took the lead once again 19-18 
after blocking a Matador attack. The 
Tritons held on to the lead 22-20, 
until a combination of kills and aces 
gave Cal State Northridge a one-point 
advantage. After seeing that lead grow 
to three points, UCSD battled back to 
tie the score at 28-28, but a kill and a 
block gave the game to Northridge, 
28-30.

Tritons Wrap Up Most Successful D-II Season 
By Joe Teve/owitz 

SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

The UCSD men's basketball team 
conduded . its 2005-06 season this 
weekend, splitting a pair of home 
contests in front of nearly 1,500 
fans. 

The Tritons started their fmal 
homestand with a win over San 
Francisco State, 50-38, on March 3. 
After the Gators shot less than 20 
percent from the field In the first 
half of the game, UCSD seemed to 
catch whatever they were carrying, 
struggling offenSively in the second 
half as well as the entire game against 
Sonoma State. As a result, the Tritons 
fell to the new California Collegiate 
Athletic Association champion 
Seawolves, 67-40, on March 4. 

T he result finishes the season 
for the Tritons with a 15-14 overall 
record, 12-8 in CCAA play. Both 
marks represent Division-ll bests for 
the Tritons and also give UCSD a 
winning record overall and in con-
ference, both D-II firsts. 

Sonoma State came to RIMAC 
Arena on the verge of its first-ever 
CCAA title, with the Tritons hoping 
to play the role of spoiler. Things 
started out well for UCSD, with the 
Seawolves missing their first two 
field -goal attempts and freshman 
guard Shane Poppen giving UCSD 
a 2-0 lead with a layup off soph-
omore guard Clint Allard's assist. 
Unfortunately, it would be the 
Tritons' only lead of the night. 

Back-to-back layups ignited 
a 32-6 Sonoma State run that put 
the Seawolves in the driver's seat 
as UCSD went into the half down 
43-17. UCSD was especially over-
matched with freshman forward

utes in the game due to injury. 
"Being on the bench is a just a 

horrible feeling," Patterson said. "It 
hurts not being able to help and 
contribute." 

Despite the loss of their leading 
scorer, the Tritons showed they still 
had some fight left in them, going 
on a 9-0 run early in the second 
half. However, the Seawolves quickly 
ended the run with their own 8-0 
charge and maintained their advan-
tage the rest of the way. 

"That's what we strive to be," 
Allard said. "They out-execute every 
toam." 

Junior forward J.T. Tipton was the 
only player on either team to score in 
double figures, leading the way with 
game highs of 15 points and seven 
rebounds. Sophomore guards Andrew 
Hatch and Jason Bull led UCSD with 
six points apiece, while Hatch also 
grabbed a team-high five boards. 
Allard had five points, four rebounds, 
four assists and two steals in the loss. 
As a team, the Tritons shot only 34.6 
percent from the field, including 7.7 
percent from three-point range. 

On March 3 against San Francisco 
State, jqAior guard Robby Peters start-
ed things off right with I three-point-

er 43 seconds into the game. From 
there, the Gators would never lead or 
even tie, as they were held scoreless 
for the first six minutes of the game. 
UCSD opened up a double-digit lead 
after 16 minutes of action and held 
San Francisco State to a miniscule

center A.J. Maulhardt stepped up in 
his first start of the year, providing an
