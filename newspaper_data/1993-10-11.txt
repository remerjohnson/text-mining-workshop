Meeting Will 
Tackle Budget 
EDUCAnON: Regents, trustees 
to meet for the first time to 
discuss universities' future 
.., Dan Krau .. 
Senior Staff Writer 

The University of California Board of 
Regents and the California State University 
(CSU) Board of Trustees will meet together 
for the rlISl time this Wednesday in Sacra-
mento to discuss the future of higher educa-
tion in California. The historic event comes 
one day after the UC Regents are scheduled to 
discuss the proposed 1994-95 budget. 

The joint meeting, which will include pre-
sentations from several key government fig-
ures and policy experts, will be lelecastlive

President Jack Peltason and CSU Chancellor 
Barry Muni lZ will take phone calls from view-
ers who call (800) 851-1222. 

According 10 university spokesman Mike 
Alva, the conference is an "excellent opponu-
nily" for the two boards to come together to 
discuss issues that the education syslems have 
in common. 

"It's an opportunity to sit down and hear 
what our university peers at CSU have to say 
- what their thoughts and ideas are about, " 
Alva said. 

CSU's budget has been cut $230 miUion 
since 1990, said CSU spokeswoman Colleen 
Bent1ey-AddJer. In addition, 8,000 classes 
have been canceled stalewide and 5,000 fac-
ulty and staff have been laid off. Enrollment 
at CSU has decreased by 40,000 students 
since 1990, she added. 

Bently-Addler said the CSU and UC sys-
lems need to know more about each other. 
Higher education is in a crisis mode through-
out the stale. " 

According 10 Bentley-Addler, Chancellor 
MunilZ, whopropoged thejointconference, is 
inleresled in further cooperation between the 
CSU and UC syslems ..

LGBA Sponsors Coming Out Rally 
EVENT: Celebration is 
part of global gay and 
lesbian holiday 
By .... MOII .,.., 
Guard.,. ReptltWr 

Members of UCSD's Lesbian, 
Gay and Bisexual Association 
(LGBA) will sponsar an open-
mike rally at noon today in the 
Price CenlCl' Plaza to commemo-
rate the ftfth annual NationaICom-
ing Out Day (NCOD). 

"NCOD is a queer holiday, a 
celebration of being out and being 
gay," said LOBA member Alex 
Gamer, a senior at Muir College. 

V ~ous speakers will inlrOduce 
the event by discussing the politi-
cal background of NCOD. After 
that, members of the public will be 
invited to walle 10 the microphone 
to express their feelings aboutper-
sonaIly "coming out" or having 
friends who have come OUL 

A wooden door frame, symbol-
izing the coming out process, will 
stand on the stage for parti<:ipants 
to walle through,accm1ing to event 
organizers. 

"Coming out is a continual pr0-
cess that occurs on personal, pri-

"We just don't wanl anything 
to do with him anymore," said a 
CM collective member. 

h:cording to htenon, it is not 
the administration's place to in-
vestigate Stepbens' allegations. 
"That's what the A.S.-Graduate 

S~tAuoc~(GSA)Co­
op Oversight CommiUce it for," 
Peterson said. 

"The oversight commiuee will 
decide if [the Cb6 collective is] 
operating in the best i.'lterest of 
students. Ifit's provcel insolvent, 
the A.S. and the GSA would have

member Y iannis Psaroudis, • 
graduate of Fifth College. 

Lasl year, there was at least one 
NCOD event in evtzy stale in the 
country. The dcmonsb'ations were 
covered by the mainstream media 
as weD as py and lesbian media. 

"Some people see queers u 
flaunting it, but being py is not • 
choice," Gamer said. 

On Oct 11, 1987, gays and 
lesbians participatcd in the "March 
011 Washington" for py and 1es-
bian rights, bringing the "Names 
Project" AIDS quilt with them. 
After the march, the 200 partici-
pantsplamedan event for thesame 
time the next year, leading to the 
creationofthefustNCODin 1?88. 

"We decided on a coming out 
day because we wanted a pro-ac-
tiveevent, " said NCOD Campaign 
Acting Director Deborah Massa. 

NCODhasexpandedintoagto-
bat event For the Past three' years, 
Switzerland and Canada have also 
held a coming out day. 

"The project is expanding more 
and more each year. Ultimately, 
we won't need a coming oui day 
because people won't assume het-
erosexuality, but diverse 

to make a ruling," Peterson 
added. 

Stephens has submiued a pr0-
posal to the oversight committee 

forthe~Caft'sspace. Stepbens 
said his intention is to esaablisb a 
student-run vegetarian restaurant 
on campus that would also assist 
Food for Thought, an 0rganiza-
tion Stephens founded to feed the 
homeless community. 

"'The ~ Cart views any It-
tempt to privatize a student orp-
niz.alion as inimicable to the inter-
ests of &be student body u a 
whole," the coIIcctive wroec. 

AtaFriday meeIing of the corn-
miuee, however, memben de-
clined to cornmeat on the pr0-
posal. "The view I take on the 
whole issue is until you present a 
caseagainsttheCht ... thespaccis 

sexualiliel," Gana said. 
The theme for this year's 

NCOD is "Take your next stepl" 
which emphasira coming out as 
an ongoina proceu ratbCI' than a 
ooe-time event 

'-rhe fact that a closet emts 
sa)'s a Iot," said Fiflb College se-
nior Aaron Raymon, who came 
out at last year's rally on the steps 
of the Main Gym. 

"I wasn't quite sure how to de-
fine m)'self, but I needed to do it 
and bear myself say it, " said Fifth 

CoIIege~LaurenGoebe1, who 
also came out at last yea"s rally. 

This year'srally will begin with 
a host of campus and community 
speakers. Among the scheduled 
participants are: Moms and Me, 
an organization for lesbian moth-
ers; Parents and FriendsofLesbi-
ans and Gays (PfLAG); and Les-
bian and Gay Community Center 
Coordinator Tony Valenzuela, a 
UCSD alwnnus. 

Gamer predicted a large turn-
out for today's evenL "Politically, 
the more people who know some-
one gay, the more support there 
will be for the gay movement and 
gay rights," he said. 

still thein," Committee Chair 
Wally Lockwood told Stephens. 

A.S. PlaidentCarla Tesalc ech-
oed Lockwood's comments. 
"Food for Thought is not the sub-
ject. The subject is that the space is 
[the ~ Cart's]. You have 10 re-
spect that, " she said. "If you want 
10 do IOIDething about this, bring 
evidence to the contrary." 

Thecommitaee II3Jeed to hold a 
special meeting to hear Slephens' 
case apinst theCbt. According to 
Lockwood, that mceaing will be 
scheduled as soon u possible, 
though be did not gi\'e. firm dale. 

Stephens' allegations have put 
him at odds with the other mem-
bers of the co-op community.

COMMENTARY: President 
Boris Yeltsin's purge of his 
opponents conjures up doubts 
as to whether he will establish a 
true democratic system of 
govermnent in Russia 
By Andre. Reynold. 
Staff Writer 

The Russian people have never before lived under instilUtions that we in the West would describe as "demo-
cratic," so it sboold come IS 00 surprise that 
the birth of democracy in that country has 
been fraught with the worst type of labor 
pains. Many commentators argue that Boris 
Yeltsin's storming of the "White House" 
parliament building last week, along with 
subsequent deaths, was fully justified in the 
name of preserving the fragile democracy 
that we all wish to see flourish. 

The American government has argued 
- with some justification - that responsi-
bility for last week's violent scenes on the 
streets of Moscow lies squarely with former 
Vice President A1eJtander Rutskoi, Parlia-
menlar) Chair Ruslan KhabuJatov and other 
members of the Russian Parliament who 
were all directly ~posed to Yeltsin's plans 
for reforms. Certainly, Rutskoi's incitement 
of the masses to allack the Oslankino 
Television complex and the Moscow City 
Mayor's office directly fanned the flames of 
violence and ultimately led to the loss of 
lives in the White House attack. 
QuHtJoeebl. MotJv .. 

However, the spark which led 10 
Russia's recent instability wu Yehsin's 
decision 10 dissolve the Parliament and rule 
virtually by decree until new legislative 
elections are held. 

Stephen Cohen. a professor at Princeton 
and an eminent scholar of current Russian 
events, has said lhal Yeltsin could have 
quite reasonably waited 18 monlhs until 
the Parliament's lenD was up 10 avoid 
bloodshed. 

His decisim 10 engineer a "showdown" 
was bound 10 exacerbate the already tense 
relatiooship, and Yehsin may have been 
motivated more by a desire 10 consolidate 
his personal power than by the desire 10 
consolidate democracy in RussiL 

Cohen also refers to the "revisionist mod-
em Russian history" which has gripped our 
media over the past week. 

To read the papers and watch the news-
casts, one would think that the Russian Parlia-
ment was coostituted almost entirely of hard-
line communists, fascists or simply unhinBed 
demagogues whose orlIy objective was 10 
thwart YelLSin at every step and tum the

COMMENTARY: U.S. foreign policy reeds to be reevaluated if 
America seeks to support am promote democratic movements 
across the global sphere 
By Be.lAvlne 
Opinion Editor 

A lmost overnight. Russia was once again embroiled in a bevy of politicallWmoil tbal tbrea1tncd 
10 ICIr the natioo apart. The crisis bepn 
wbc:n Russian President Boris Yeltsin. in 
his ooaoin& battle with natiooalist hard-
liners, dissolved Parliament and called for 
new elections to be held in December. 
Parliament, in turn, voted 10 impeach 
Yeltsin and appoint his rival, Vice 
President Alexander Rutskoi, U interim 
PresidenL In the aid, Yeltsin gave the 
order 10 storm the Parliament building and 
crush his oPponents' umed resistance. 

Political struggles marked by coups or 
purges differ from one crisis 10 the next, 
the leadership's rbeIOric in justifying ilB 
undemocratic behavior remains strikingly 
similar. YellBin defended his authoritative 
stance by usertin& that the crackdown on 
natiooalist bard-liners wu necessary 10 
ensure Russia's continued conversion 10 
democracy. He promised that his eua-

a transfer of power would occur with I new

COMMENTARY: Congress had little to debate over this past summer, so why not attempt to tackle America's 
nwnber-one source of street violence - the television? 

TUNE IN, TURN ON, EAT I£AD 
By Philip Mlc ...... 
Senior Staff Writer 

Television violence is bad - rt-
ally bad. It's tearing away at the 
fabric of society and fmgerpainting 
on the great wall of liberty. Televi-
sion violence is the worst crisis UUs 
country has ever faced, worse than 
war, poverty, the Church of 
Scienoology and a room full of real 
eState agents combiJted. Television 
violence begets lewd, horrific be-
havior. It drives our nation's youth 
10 sass back at their parents, con-
ceive children out of wedlock and 
store up munitions for their inevi-
table revolt against the state. TV 
violence is, in short, bad with a 
capital • B.' 

I know all this because Congress 
IOld me so. And if there's one group 
of people that !mows about lewd, 
horrific behavior, it's cenainly the 
men and women of Congress. 

In case you missed it this sum-
mer, TV violence was all the rage in 
the halls of government and in the 

op~ pages of newspapers every-
where. Congressmen,lackingsolDC-
thing important like I budget plan or 
health<are reform to debate, held 
hearing after hearin& to decide iftbe 
violence depicted on television wu 
ripping the nation apart 11 the seams. 
Network executives were called 
before Congress and given I stem 
talking-IO. Everyone, it seemed, wu 
in consensus - television violence 

was on every charmel, and it had 10 
be slOpped. 

But this is hardly earth-shatter-
ing news. Violence and TV have 
been partners ever since Gilligan 
first bonked the Skipper on the bead 
with coconuts. Why did Congress 
all of a sudden wake up and decide 
that TV violence was the worst threat 
10 the nation since flag burning? 

All this sudden interest in TV 
violencecertain!ywasn'toutofcon-
cern for the well-being of the citi-
zenry. Rather,congressrnensaw the 
whole TV violence issue as their 
chance to look like thoughtful pub-
lic servants by debating something 
for which there really is no debate. 
Unlike taxes, abortion and smutty 
Robert Mapplethorpe photos, vio-
lence is one of those issues about 
which everyone in the world can 
agree. 

After all, there's not asing1e poli-
tician who would come forward and 
say, "Y ou1mow, I don't think there's 
tllO/4gh violence on TV. What we 
need 10 do is show more decapita-
tions, drive-by shootings and 
beheadings." Well, Senator Dole 
might, but no one else would. 

So after I summer of haranguing 
craven TV executives, what solu-
tion has COJlII'CSI wrought? Apart 
from decrying TV violence u one 
of the seven plagues of man, the biS 
proposal seems 10 be wuning li-
bels. Before violenrprograms, the

networks have pledged 10 lira warn-
ing 10 viewers, urging parents 10 
shield theirofIspring frorntbegrisly 
camage about 10 ensue. 

Now, IS every 12-year-dd boy 
wbo bas ever stayed up all night 
watching the scrambled feed of the 
Playboy Channel will tell you, stick-
ing a warning label on a TV program 
is lhe one way 10 ensure that every 
youngster in America will want 10

blckseatof a Buick, tbere'SDO greater

stining lutluity, wbetherit's sneak-
ing into a rated-R movie, buying a 2 

Uve Crew CD or warcbing an epi-
sode of HYPD BlMe. 

Parental advisories, although 
well-intentioned, are gentnlly ~ 
less. There are DO less !han I thou-
sud things aside from TV violence 
that are probably bad for you -
eating fastfood, bungee jumping m1 
badgCJVernment to name three - but 
you don't see anyooerunning around 
trying 10 tattoo warning labels on 
Ted Kennedy 0' Barbara Boxer. 

Congress, apparently realizing 
that this warning label business is a 
complete sham, has declared that 
more drastic steps may be neces-
sary. Some congressmen have gone 
so far as to vow that the government 
should impose mandatory restric-
tions on programming, a horrifying 
thought at best. r mean., would you 
really want someone like Jesse 
Helms deciding which programs 
were government-approved? Would 
you want Bill Clinton? The man 
boogies down 10 Fleetwood Mac. 

At the heart of this TV violence 
ruckus is the naive concept that gov-
ernment has 10 let as a sWTogate 
parent We want our elected offi-
cials 10 k.eep us healthy, hold our 
hands when we cross the street and 
check our milk after the expiratioo 
date. This is certainly a heart-warm-
ingnotion, but a thoroughly imprac-
tical one. Government wu formed 
so that our roads could be paved and 
our borders protected from ornery

Canadians and that's pretty much iL 
A quick. glance at the Bill fX Rights 
reveals not what govemmenl intends 
to do, but what it promises 10 keep 
its nose OUI of. Ott. sure, every now 
and then, the government has 10 step 
in and stop evil businessmen from 
dumping dioxen in kindergarten 
classrooms, but that's a case of gov-
ernment helping those who can't 
help themselves. 

Violence on TV is not such a 
case. Unlike the telescreens in 1984, 
every TV, from the lowliest Zenith 
10 the mightiest Sony, is equipped 
with an off switch. If parents are 
concerned that junior is watching 
far 100 many people get wasted on 
the lUbe each night. then they damn 
well better tum the accursed thing 
off. Whining and mewing for gov-
ernment intc:rventiOllIOSive us from 
the horrors of prime time just can't 
replace persona1 responsibility. 

But politicians justlovt 10 buu in 
where they don't belong, First 
Amendment be damned. Last week, 
SenaurPaulSimon(D-lll.)declared 
that the television industry had yet 
10 act on his warnings 10 curb TV 
violence. 

Unless the networks got their act 
together, Simon said, the govern-
ment might have 10 step in - mean-
ing that politicians would decide 
which programs are naughty and 
which are .-okay. No thanks, Sena-
tor.1 already have a DlOOI.

DEMOCRACY: 
Yeltsin to renege on 
promises? 
ConUnued fronI pac ... 
autocrats willing to relinquish pan 
of their autonomous authority to 
other institutions, which could p0-
tentially threaten their positions? 
Can America trust Yehsin to relin-
quish part of his power when the 
time comes? 

Apanfrom our desire to see Rus-
sia adopt democratic ideals, why 
exactly are we supporting Yeltsin? 
What sort of interests are at stake 
should Yeltsin lose power? 
hcurlty laterests 

Realpolilil scholars argue lhat 
the primary interest in any foreign 
policy behavior is the nation-state' s 
security. Many suggest that West-
ern security depends on who con-
trols the Russian leadership and 
hence the codes to Russia's nuclear 
arsenal. At firslglance, it seems that 
America's future security lies with 
a Western-friendly Boris Yeltsin 
rather than with a hostile national-
isl 

Columnist George Will adds a 
DOmJativeperspective toRealpolilil 
by suggesting lhat American for-
eign policy should concentrate only 
on interests concerning its security 
within the global community. 

According to Will, moral im-
peratives are an irrelevant condition 
for American diplomacy unless our 
interests in the matter are clearly 
defmed. U.S. foreign policy should 
balance the costs ofiIUerventionwilh 
any security benefits that come with 
the operation. Desert Storm is an 
example of a successful balance. In 
S<lmalia. the diplomatic complica-
tions and costs of performing hu-
manitarian service were minimal 
DO fragile African alliance to worry 
about. DO armed Somalian militia to 
baule wilh. EVa! DOW, the COltS 
have become intolerable for lCVeral 
Coopessmen who have called for 
American withdrawal. 

The concept of security, how-
ever, is very ambiguous. How to 

acbieveitis~Dn'Cunclear. What 
qualifies as an actualissucof Amm-
can security is a question politicians 
raise evtSy time U.S. armed forces 
land OIl foreign soil. Senate Armed 
Servica 0Iairman Sam Nunn (D-
Georgia) demanded that Clintoo 
clearly define any Ammcan inaet-
estJ at stake before ICIIdin8 off 
25,000 troops to ovmee a peace 
agreement in Bosnia. 
Security •• De-.oc:ncr 

Democracy in other nations can 
present a viable security benefit to 
the United States. 

Scholars such as Michael Doyle 
have observed that democracies do 
not go to war wilb other democra-
cies. 

A balance of power within the 
democratic SllUcture makes it more 
diffICult for one bnnch to seize ar-
bittary cootrol over miliWy affairs. 

One couId suggest then llw our 
foreign policy should support only 
the general ideal of democracy in 
Russia ralber Iban an indivdual 
leader. Who is actually at the helm 
is irrelevant because democracy is 
usually not the brainchild of auto-
cralS. 

Yellsin is also a viable option for 
U.S. security. His oppooents repre-
sent radical nationalism, commu-
nist aspirations and anti-democratic 
ideals - defmite threats 10 Western 
security. 

YellJin could rid the Wesl, once 
and for all, of the lut remnants of 
old Soviet communism.

YELTSIN: 
Questionable moves 
by Yeltsin 

DISIIJ4USIONS FROM THE EDITOR? 
Continued from p., ... 
Russian clock back to the days of 
Stalin. But as Cohen points out, the 
Russian Parliament was:originaily a 
staunch backer ofYeltsin. They were 
the people who supported him in his 
ballie against Gorbachev; they 
backed him (and democracy) dur-
ing the 1992 attempted coup. In 
addition, many leading parliamen-
tarians were decisive in construct-
ing Yellsin 's economic refonn strat-
egy. 

The Parliament, while not demo-
cratical Iy elected, did represent some 
of the mainstream schools of thought 
which dominate Russian society to-
day. 

Yes, there were fonner commu-
nists and fascists, butlhey were pre-
dominantly reformers who checked 
themselves and began to articulate 
the views of the ordinary folk who 

w~re being severely hurt by 
Yeltsin's :~ock-tberapy reforms. 
yaltsl.'. TKtIca 

The key question is. how should 
Yeltsin (or any other Russian leader 
for that mauer) handle criticism. 
Should we applaud Yeltsin's IC-
tions if he handles criticism by abol-
ishing national institutions (which 
could potentially be democratic), 
monopolizing television, banning 
political parties and retarding local 
representation by firing regional 
leaders who happen not to support 
him. 

He also jeopardized any future 
plans for true democracy by forting

Editor, 
In the words of the number-ooe 

radio talIc show host in the nation. 
"Liberalism is the most gutless 
choice you can make." All you have 
to do is be "for" everything. Clearly, 
Ben Lavine's commeruary. "Disil-
lusions from the Right, " came from 
a well-meaning, but misguided per-
spective. 

Lavine is certainly free to talk in 
positive terms about what he thinks 
are the best solutions to society's 
problems. But when he ventures into 
his own version of conservatism in 
an auempt to tear it down, his points 
become terribly muddled in inaccu-
racy. 

Though little is accomplished on 
either side of the argument due to 
his shotgun of negativity, a couple 
of points must be addressed. 

FIrst, Lavine said that conserva-
tives .... .like manyother groups, of-
ten act like whining victims of an 
uncaring system." That the system 
would ever be characterized as car-
ing is a liberal idea in itself. Jack 
Kemp has said, "Conservatives de-
fine compassion not by the nwnber 
of people receiving some kilXl of 
government aid but rather by the 
nwnber of people who no longer 
neediL" 

Instead of wishing the govern-
ment cared about them, conserva-
tives wish the government would 
just leave them alone. 

The issue is not tax cuts versus 
welfare handouts; it is about limit-
ing government intervention so as 
to allow individuals the opportunity 

• 

to succeed or fail on their own mer-
its and initiatives. The idea lhat gov-
ernment should take responsibility 
for individual welfare and thedistri-
bution of income is called social-
ism. 

The assertion that conservative 
opposition to the 1993 budget deal 
was not justified was an attempted 
partisan swipe. In reality, most 
DemocraLS Irnew it was a carbon 
copy of the 1990 budget deallhat 
plunged us into recession and failed 
10 live up 10 its rosy deficit reduc-
tion billing. 

Why else would it have taken so 
much ann-twisting by a president to 
coerce his own party to pass the plan 
by the absolute slimmest of mar-
gins? 

The truth is lhat all takes create a 
drag on the economy. The question 
is merely 10 what degree and for 
whal marginal benefits. Anyone who 
has taken even the most basic eco-
nomic course can tell you lhat the 
problem of scarcity,limited supply 
but unlimited desires, forces us to 
make choices. 

It sounds nice to be in favor of 
more lavishly fWlded social pro-
grams, but what is the tradeoff or 
marginal cost? 

Will the increased taxes slow the 
economy, put people out of work 
and focus even more of the punish-
ing burden on those who dared per-
severe to succeed? 

Lavine's negative tone and fluny 
of extraneous shots at conservatism 
run counter 10 any productive dis-
cussion of the issues. Anyone can

hurl insults and say what they would 
like in an ideal world, but it would 
be refreshing to hear the aulhor talIc 
in realistic tenns about the tough 
choices necessary for true reform 
and progress. 

Philip Saylor 

lavine Is Not Right 
Editor, 

I was disappoirued to read Ben 
Lavine's "Disillusions From the 
RighI," in his feeble attempt to 
counter the conservative movement 
in this country. I respect the efforts 
made by the conservatives of this 
great nation. They are the ones who 
have shown great support for the 
Gulf War. 

They madepcoplerealize lhe fact 
that the nation's social val ues are 
deteriorating into a chaotic mess. 
And they even recognize some 
wasteful spending in the govern-
ment system. Without them, who 
knows what this country could be-
come. 

Second of all, Lavine tried to 
bring country music (Garth Brooks' 
new a1burn,11l Pieces) as a craze in 
conservatism. 

COWltry music presents the good 
old traditional values that people 
lack by respecting our parents,lov-
ing our wives, working hard all 
day, and even being proud of this 
nation. Thatisdefmitely better than 
listening to music that tells us to 
join a gang, to kill cops and to use 
drugs. 

I personally would rather choose 
the values presented in country mu-

Truthfully, I am a moderate Re-
publican and I disagree with conser-
vatives in some issues, too. And 
admittingly ,they can be wrong once 
in a while. 

However, Lavine's claim to call 
conservative ideals an illusion is not 
right either. Their ideas are impor-
tant as any other opinion in this 
country. 

Anti<onservatives should not 
accuse these people of being wrong 
all the time. Because these anti-
conservatives will be sorry if they 
are "right"

portacomplete halt 10 10gging in that area. are 
trying 10 show the public the importance Of 
the issue. "CAI2IRG and 26 ocher PIROs 
across the nabon. • weD as the naIionaI 
PIRG, have decided 10 make this issue the 
main campaign f<X' the year," said UCSD 
CALPIRG Representative Greg Lewis. 

The campaign is comprised primarily of 
a postcard campaign directed at President 
Clinton. The idea oCThursday's play arose 
when members of both organizations 
brainstormed about how 10 make the public 
aware of the issue. 

The dramatization featured students who 
acted as loggers cutting down trees in the 
Pacific Nonhwest Student members of en-
vironmental organizations pleaded with the 

"loggers" to stop, pointing out dlat JO per-
cent of the ancient forests remain in exist-
ence, that many endangered species would 
be killed and that cures for distasea have 
been found in the foresLs. 

The dramatization concluded with orga-
nization members soliciting other students 
10 sign postcards supporting CALPIRG's 
and SEAC's stance on the forests. 

CALPIRG and SEAC both recognize 
that the impending battle will not be as easy 
as it was in their playlet They said logging 
inleteSts have a wide base of support. since 
much of the Nonhwesaem economy is based 
on the lumber industry. A complete halt of 
logging in the Northwest could mean major 
losses in revenue f<X'the logging companies 
and unemployment for the people who work 
for these companies, according 10 a 
CALPIRG spokesman. 

"We only have one paid, full-time lob-
byist working in Washington while die log-
ging companies have many lobbyists work-
ing on their part," said CALPIRG Repre-
sentative Jon Bleyer. 

"Our goal is 10 get 3,000 post.cards sent 10 
the pre..qcJent We already have J.200 for &he 
two weeks that we've been running the cam-
paign," Lewis said. Students have obtained 
the signatures by standing around the hump, 
flagging down students and then asking them 
if they would be interested in sending a

RENO: Address 
confronts problems 
of immigration 
Continued from ...,. 1. 

In touting NAFfA, Renociled 
a 1991 study by the University of 
California which claimed lhatfree 
trade in conjunction with u.S. ceo-
nomic reforms would reduce the 
flow of immigration by 250,000 10 
1.1 million. The study found that 
this would lead 10 a real wage 
increase of six percent for low-
wage earning Americans. 

In contrast, Reno argued, the 
failure of NAFf A. would only 
worsen the agricultural problem. 
"If NAFf A fails, our urban cen-
ters wiD not be able 10 absorb the 
influx [of illegal immigration)," 
Reno said. 

"A richer, more slab Ie, more 
competent Mexico is the only s0-
lution to immigration," she added. 

Reno addressed criticisms 
against NAFf A, adding that most 
of the arguments against the plan 
are mostly political rhetoric. "Ille-
gal immigrants come to America 
for jobs, and those who say other-
wise aren't speaking the truth. 
They're just being political," said 
Reno. 

"I understand that some [politi-
cians) are tempted 10 pull back,lO 
hunker down, 10 wail out the eco-
nomic storm ... but that's not the 
path that Californians have taken 
when faced with economic chal-
lenges in the past, " she said. 

During a 2O-minute question-
and-answer period following 
Reno's speech, a student asked 
about a recent incident in which 
Mexican offICials delained a group 
of three dozen American and Ca-
nadian citizens on a NAFf A fact-
finding tour for the International 
Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers (AIM). A 
UCSD student was among those 
detained. Reno declined 10 answer 
the question, saying that she was 
not fully informed of all the delails 
of the incidenL 

Reno was also noncommittal 
on whethershe wouldinstituteOp-
eration Blockade at the San Oi-
eg~ Tijuana border. Local politi-
cians have been calling for a com-
plete shut-down of tile border used 
recently in EJ Paso, Texas. 

In a press conference after-
wards, Reno added that !here was 
no limetableon a border blockade. 
"I just want 10 do it as soon as 
possible .... I hope that it will be 
shortly," she said. 

Reno also addressed the ong~ 
ing war on drugs. "I don't think 
[the war on drugs] was ever fought 
effectively. There has not been 
enough balance between enforce-
ment and treatment, " Reno said. 

While Reno was bolding court 
with the media, a panel discussion 
on NAFf A was held in the 
Robinson Auditorium. Among 
those participating were History 
ProfCSS(l'Michael Bemslcin, Cen-
ter of U.S.-Mexican Studies Di-
rector Wayne Cornelius, Institute 
of the Americas' Colleen Morton 
and Miles Kahl« and Lawrence 
Krause of IRPS.

My Reign in Spain 
EXCHANGE: After spending a year abroad, college students share their 
memories of studying, partying and living in a completely different culture 
IJ ErIII Anderson 
Guatdian Reporter 

E Am YEAIl,1HBElxx:ATION Abroad Program (EAP) sends approximately 230 UCSD slUdents to 
31 countries around the globe. 
Available throughout the UC sys-
tem, EAP was established to 
broaden students' horizonsbyal-
lowing them to study in different 
cultures. Through EAP, UC stu-
dents can eam credits toward 
graduation while studying abroad. 
Students in the program can take 
advanlage of academic and cul-
tural opportunities they wouldn't 

nonnaUy have in the UC system. 
I should know - I was one of 

22 students from UCSD 
who spent a year abroad 

in Spain. 

GUARDIAN 

FEHTUJIES 
Determined 10 milk my EAP 

experience dry, I set out to im-
merse myself completely in the 
Spanish culture. This meant living 
with Spanish natives. It was a scary 
challenge because it also meant 
straying from the "American 
pack," the group of EAP students 
from UCSD, that served in the 
beginning as a comforting refuge. 

I reminded myself that getting 
a piso, a Spanish apartment, with 
the locals was theonly real chance 
I would have 10 improve my Span-
ish and possibly reach fluency. 
So, after three chaotic and hellish 
days of searching for a home, I 
moved in with Lola and Cannen, 
two "real live" Spanish women. 
At the time, I never imagined the 
goodfonuneofthatchoice.i..ook-
ing back now, I consider myself 
luclcy 10 have found them. 

A lot of the EAPer's did not 
strike the same jackpot I did. By 
the end of the year, half of Ihe 
Americans had moved to other 
places because of dissatisfaction 
with their living situations. An-
drea McTrusty, ~ Revelle College 

senior who spenl lasl year in 
Granada with Ihe HAP program, 
looked fOl' a new place in January 
after deciding that her landlady 
toot advaillage of her. "You can 
definitely change [homes]," she 
said. "It's not easy, but it's p0s-
sible. There's always something 
beller out there." 

Many EAP students shared 
apartments with lonely, old wid-
ows bordering on senility, while 
others shared with university stu-
dents who had some peculiar hab-
its. 

I lived in " the student zone" of 
the city, so called because more 
than 15 bars were packed door-to-
door on my block alone, and the 
street ran for 20 blocks. Every 
Friday and Saturday night, the 
noise and music from the streets 
rose up five stories 10 my room 
until about four in the morning. 

Our apartment consisted of 
three single rooms, one dining! 
living room, a small kiachen, and a 
very small bathroom. Spanish 
pisos rarely have washing ma-
chines 01' ovens. and only a few 
have central heating. Because all 
Spaniards hang their clothes out 
on their patios, clothes dryers are 
unheard of. 

After living with Lola and 
Cannen, I saw Spaniards as open,

SPAIN: Enjoying 
the hospitality of 
another land 
Continued from ,.,. 10 
generous and loving people. Lola 
and Cannen accepted and included 
me from day one. They laUght me 
how to cook great Spanish meals, 
where to find the best wine bars 
and the cheapest food markets, 
and always listened to me patiently 
as I tried to feebly express myself 
in Spanish. They even gave me 
emotional support when I missed 
home, and good advice, like hav-
ing patience with the Spanish lan-
guage. 

Gradually, 1 was welcomed into 
the home of every one ofCannen's 
and Lola's friends and relatives. 
This made me realize that the ex-
pression, Mi casa es s" casa, my 
home is your home, most appro-
priately describes Spanish hospi-
tality. 

Warren College senior Tabitha 
Hart, who spent last year in 
Granada as well, said she agreed 

- with my view of Spaniards. "Span-

Kill 

ish people are very friendJy, very 
sincere," she said. "I made the 
mosl genuine and meaningful 
friendships. It doesn't matter 
where you come from or whal 
language you speak. If you put 
away all the false conceptions and 
stereotypes, there's a natlU'lll ca-
pacity for friendship inside every 
human being." 

"Spanish people live day-to-
day and are really dow!,! to eanh," 
McTrusty said. "They all seem 
happy with whal they have. They 
weren't looking for more material 
things than they already had." 

McTrusty felt that one diffi-
culty in meeting people was break-
ing down the preconceived stereo-
types of Americans, so that people 
could get to know you as an indi-
vidual. 

Most of the Spaniards' stereo-
types of Americans originaled 
from the movies and television 
sitcoms, which depict an exagger-
ated view of American life. For 
example, they were amazed by the 
luxurious lives of Beverly Hills 
9021O's teens and assumed all of 
America was like lhaL 

The UCSD Guardi_ 

Through our livinS situation, 
which we discovered was truly the 
detaminanl of our happiness or 

oo~nes~we~eUmil_ 
with the lifestyle of the Spanish 
people. 

I learned 10 adjUSl to a com-
pletely different concept of time 
because Spanish time is much men 
relaxed than American time. For 
example, when a Spaniard says 
"now," helshe means "wi&hin the 
hour." Even Ihough it was hard to 
get used 10 such different cultural 
views, it seems that all of &he 30 
UC students on the EAP program 
ended up with a great undersrand-
ing of Spanish culture. 
T .... of the Ilu. 

I must confess that last year my 
American friends affectionately 
dubbed me "Slug" because I took 
great advantage of the Spanish 
lifestyle. I slept in most mornings 
and took advantage of all of the 
siestas, or midday naps. 

With all of this sleeping, it was 
no wonder ahat 1 was usually late 
to most of my classes. My panici-
pation in the Spanish concept of 
time also allowed me to Davel and

siShtsee more IhIn 1 would have if 
I had been living under the Slrict 
time constraints that are common 
10 life in America. 

My daily ICheduJe while living 
in Spain reflected my assimilation 
inlO Spanish CullUlC. I ate huse, 
delicious midday meals, then 
promptly spread out on the couch 
for a power siesta. After all, what 
is more important than proper di-
gestion? Dwing that time, my 
friends and I made sure to catch 
&he daily Venezuelan soap opera 
- strictly 10 practice our listening 
skills, of course. 

Around five o' clock, we would 
pour small cups of strong espresso 
coffee and ate sweets 10 help us 
wake up from our sitsta. Lola and 
Carmen would then return to work 
until nine or IOatnighL The Span-
ish day is interrupted by a tradi-
tional midday break, normally a 
family gathering, during which 
people eat , converse and rest be-
fore working again. 

The Spanish lifestyle affected 
everything I did during the year, 
but nothing more than my aca-
demic life. We were all surprised 

---....... -------------------------________ Cl_U.&AInc.l.,_--' 

MODday, October 11,1993 

10 know that we wouldn't be start-
ing classes oolil mid-October, and 
that &he last enrollment date was 
late November. Compared 10 those 
at American universities, the Span-
ish schedules struck us as very late 
and lenienL 

Ditching class could have been 
called the Spanish student's sec-
ond religion. Lola IOld me that 
once she showed up for a final 
exam and had to asIt a fellow class-
mate which one &he teacher was. 
BUI the professors wc:resometimes 
just as bad as the students, ditch-
ing the students frequently and 
sporadically to travel or for other 
unknown reasons. 

When it came 10 studying, we 
just followed our Spanish peers. 
We drank 90 cent cervezas and ate 
tapas all year long, then crammed 
the whole month of May for the 
one huge end-of-the-year final in 
Jooe. When in Spain, do as the 
Spaniards do. 

A few of ~ found jobs tending 
bar or teaching English (mostly 
swear words), but without a work 
permit, employment was rare. 
Americans interested in teaching 
had to advertise their services pri-
vately by word of mouth or by 
posting flyers, t!:en meet either at 
their pupil's home or in a bar. 
Only a small percentage of EAP 
students worked. 

For the resl of us. living in a 
foreign country was challenging 
enough. The majority of Spanish 
students do not hold down a job 
during the school year nor during 
the summer. Spaniards consider 
being a studenl a full-time com-
miunenl, almost like a job, and 
treat it as their sole activity.

The fust weekend in May, El 
Df4 de IIu CrllCes, The Day of the 
Crosses, was held. Every large 
street and back alley was jammed 
with enthusiastic GrllNlllUtos sip-
ping sparlding white wine and cold 
beer from the boolbs set up 011 
every corner. 

Women and children dressed 
up in colodul, exllavagant cos-
lume dresses and danced the 
SevillaM, the most popular of 
Spain's dances originalins in 
Sevilla. It was three non-stop days 
and nights of tuUilllica loclUa -
authentic craziness. 

The bottom line of my year-
long adventure is that Spaniards 
simply respect social time - time 
for family and friends - and time 
ror relaxation. They set aside an 
equal amount of time for work and 
for play, and they know how to 
enjoy themselves. 1be difference 
between Spaniardsand Americans 
is that Spaniards truly take the 
time to relax and smell the roses. 

Han noticed this change in her-
self after a year in Spain. "I don't 
lei myself get stressed OUL I used 
to freak out, but now it's not that 
big of a deal and 1 take a big 
breath," she said. 

"Ah,Espalia ... whc:rehaveyou

ftrSl lboughlS of reflection upon 
returning home this summer. Last 
yeat was pure mag~ for me, 8Dd

a recent guest coach. I can say 
that the whole experience is quite 
enjoyable from a number of as-
pects. 

Thia is not just some tempo-
rary figurehead function. I was 
constantly given bits of infor-
mation regarding the inner work-
ings of the team both on and off 
tbe court, and generally made to 
feel like I was part of the team 
by Coach Dannevik, Assistant 
Coach Diana Klintworth and the 
team members. They really made 
an effort to show me what the 
team was all about. 

In additon, a lot of my mis-

livings and misinformation 
about the coexistence of spons 
and academics (at leastat UCSD) 
have been cleared up. 

The volleyball team members 
have no athletic scholarsips, no 
significant special privileges and 
are more concerned about their 
classes than about the nell game. 

Considering the track record 
of tbe volleyball team in the re-
cent past (sill national champi-
onships in 12 years). this is 
amazing. In the volleyball pro-
gram. the athletes are students. 

I would like to encourage 
other faculty to take advantage 

of this gueat coaching opportu-
nity when offered and perhaps 
suggest that other sports con-
sider instituting such a program. 

If faculty were more closely 
aware of the kind of student-
athlete being raised at UCSD. 
the mistaken impressions har-
bored by many faculty about the 
athletic program and its panici-
pants would evaporate. A closer 
relationship between sports and 
academics would certainly ben-
efit the university.

"They wm the best team we've 
played so far. We played as weU as we 
could have," Dannevik said "They 
were error-free and had a counter for 
everything we did"

The W arriocs took games one and 
two swiftly and relatively WlChaI-
Ienged by scoces of 15~ and 15-7, 
respectively. 

A1dwghdawntwogamcstonooe, 
the Tritons refused 10 give in. After 
faUing behind 5-1 and 94 in game 
three, UCSD rallied 10 tie the sare at 
14 bebe fmally succumbing to the 
overpowering Warria attack, losing 
the final game, 16-14. 

Before SalW'day'sa>nIeSt, San Di-
ego held a team meeting in which 
Dannevik coofrooted his team's re.-
cent lackluster play. He stressed in-
creased intensity and maturity. 

"I challenged my playen men-
tally to grow up a little bit," the coach 
said. "I think they respooded very 
weU [despite the loss1. I Ihink we 
played a lot more intensely, and 
Westmoot wasjustavery tough team. " 

After losing to Point Im1a fOW' 
days earlier, the Tritons Iried sane 
positioo changes against WestmoIll, 
flip-flopping jwli<l' Julie Harvey and 
senioc Laura Kranz ffOOl the right 
side to the left. 

Dannevik sent a wake-up call 10 
the SUUggling outside hiuer by not 
playing Kranz in the Point Lona 
game. Kranzrespooded bycoUectin& 
nine 1ril1s against the Warriors, and, 
more importantly, conuniuing only 
two errors after averaging more than 
seven errors per game 00 the seasoo 
so far. 

After four SIlaight defeats, most 
teams would be flWlg into disarray. 
But the Tritons are merely learning 
fum their miSlakts and actuaUy ben-'-
efiting from a schedule that presenlS 
them with ale rugged game after an-
other. Dannevik and his team remain 
Wlfazed 

"When we're not playing Divi-
sion ill opponents, we want to play 
the best teams we can. I'm not trying 
to rack up wins foc some kind of 
personal coaching record. If we 
wanted to, we could easily be 14-2 
playing lesser opponents." 

Because of the valuable experi-
ence that a diffICUlt slate of games 
brings, Dannevik says that he is not 
particularly worried about any type of 
lapse in focus oc loss of momentum. 

HeadmilS, however, that he would 
like to see UCSD gamer ooe more 
victory befoce its long-awaited tangle 
with Divisioo ill defending national 
champioo Washingtoo University of 
St. Louis at the Mizuno Tournament 
Friday night. 

"Hopefully we can get • win 
against Occidental on Tuesday so that 
we can gain a liule mce confidence 
foc the rest of the season." 

COLUMN: 
Jordan bids farewell 
ContInued hili .... 24 
bIdt problems became too much foc 
the 00UDtry boy frcxn French Lick, 
Indiana. to ovatOme. 

The loa of two eX the games' 
~p~~wu~Bw 
theNBA'ssavinggracewuMJ. We 
could still watch him I0Il" through the 
air, rmgue extended, and tomahawk-
dunk the ball like no odD' bumlnhad 
befoce. MJ. could Ilill dazz1e us with 
a legend's flare for the spectacular, 
while we bied to ld go of Magic and 
Bird. Bw now the third of the three 
has departed. 

The beauty of bdan was that no 
matter bow much hi. popularity 
W<J'ked apinst him, be could always 
elevate his game IhIl much higher. 

Jordan single-handedly directed 
the dismal Bulls frcxn the rni1e«ep 
depths of the standings to repeat play-
off berths. Not since the likes of Wilt 
Ownberlainhad the leagueseensuch 
a prolifIC scorer at suer.. an early age. 
Jordan wu the team, bQt even he 
needed a supporting cast 

So the BuUs drafted the likrs of 
Scottie Pippen, BJ. Anmuong l!Id 
Horace Grant to build uound their 
centerpiece. In Jordan '5 sevmth year 
in the league, a team fnm the Secood 
Cityfinisbcdfirstas theBuUscmtrged 
as the NBA Ownpioos. They were 
the tout of Olicqo, a city wbotie 
sports teams WCJe IIOIaious foc their 
futilityduring playoffs. 

During his rise to success, 
Michael's off-court hobby d glll1-
blin3 came under qut;llim. 

A SS7,OOO check with his signa-
1We m it wu given to m exq 
dealer and convicted feIoo u payoff 
for m outstandina debt. At the time, 
Jordan claimed it wu merely aloin. 
He later re.;inded IhIl statcmc:nl and 
told tbe trWb. 

Bw what did it mauer anyway? 
Wbat a spcI1I figw'C data with bis 
spare lime is his t..sincR, not the 
public's. A reced book by II.IPIJOICd 
friend Richard EJquinu revealed 
moreofJcxdIn'sgamhlin&capach, 
giving deWls of bow he lOll millioos 
00 the golf COUI'IC. 

Bw if Micbael is guilty of any-
thin&. it is lha1 he is arguably the DIOIIt 
c:ompeUlivea&hlefe any sportbu Mt 
ICC'Il. He IlCelIlingly willed the BuI1s' 
third-straigttNBA(]wq>ioosbiplut 
June against Owtes Bartdey and the 
Pbomix Suns. He simply would DOt 
ld his team loIJe. In the pnx:ess, he 
surpassed boIh Magic and BinI by 
leading his team to three coosecutive 
world titles.. 

Tbroughoutall histrialsandbibl-
lations off the court, Jordan could 
always tum to his father and tat 
friend, James J<J'dan. Bw wbc:n be 
loll his fadler, be could not just walk 
00 the t.s!cetblll court and put all the 
rumors behind him. This wu nokqp 
a game, this wu life. 

Nobody can blame one of the 
w<l'Id's IDOlIl caupetitive IDCIl f<l' 
cooceding to reality. The flet is that 
life dealt Michael Joolan a devastat-
ing blow. The tragic and brutal mur-
dI2' ofm, fathcrproyed to be the 8Iraw 
that b'oke tbe supeISIar's bICk. 

We should not be utterly stumcd 
by Michael Jordan's retin:mml from 
the game be so loves.. The sips have 
been IbCJe f<l'the Iutfew yean. Afttr 
all, what more can this mm do? 

During the preaI coofercoce, J<I'-
dan said he had loll his desire to play

Bw 00 some days, be 111111Caldcd the

.Power Player 
SOCCER: CaJXain and senior-standout Ollis Romey has returned 
from a year at Washington State to lead the Triton men's soccer team 

ByGreaWNnn 
Seniot' Stair Ktitar 

C bris Romey is confused. 1be senior knows Ihat he is the leading scorer on the 10-2-1 UCSD men's soccer team, but he's not 
exactly sure how he got there. 

"I'm not really sure how it works, it j ust 
goes." However it happened, Romey is Ihe 
"'rilOns' offensive cannon, having already 
notched an amazing 12 goals and three as-
sists for a total of 27 points two-thirds of the 
way into the season. 

Romey's career at UCSD did not start out 
wilh such a bang, however. He departed his 
hometown of Moscow, Idaho, for San Diego 
in 1989, the year after the Tritons captured 
their first Division DI Men's Soccer Na-
tional Championship. 

"I j ust wanted to get away from Idaho. 
My parents visited here and UC Irvine and 
then they brought me down here. I liked the 
area and really liked [UCSO Head Coach 
Derek Armstrong)." 

Romey, with his parenti' constant urging 
~'\dsupport. wu the epitome of an all-around 
athlete in high school. He participated in 
crosscounby, basketball md wrestling back 
in Moscow. 

He continues to showcase his stocked 
cross-Ulining itinerary here in sunny San 
Diego and pllDS to step off the soccer field 
and onto center court fc. the Triton men's 
volleyball team u soon u this year's soccer 
season ends. 

Romey's fint couple of yearl were

"confusing. It was a different style of pllY 
Ind [Armstrong) was hard to understand. I 
remember there was one drill we were 
supposed to do while I was a freshman, 
and all of the seniors were just standing 
around because they didn' t know what to 
do ei ther. 

" I didn't know what my role was, so I 
spent the first two years just learning the 
system and geuing lucky," he said 

1be Triton eventually straightened things 
out. Ouring UCSO's second championship 
run in 1991, Romey emerged as the team's 
leading scorer and played a crucial role as the 
talent-packed Tritons retained their second 
championship crown. 

Last year, however, Romey's road to 
studom took a slight detour. Suffering from 
I tom ligament in his elbow and some aCI-
demic difficulties, the animal physiology 
major decided to transfer to Washington 
State, just down the road from his home-
town, to recuperate md get back on track 
with his studies. 

During winter break in 1991, Romey met 
the girlfriend of then -Washington State foot-
ball star and current Detroit Lion kicker 
Jason Hansen. 

"I wu talking 10 her and he called to tell 
ber that a television station hid just called to 
ask him what color limo he wanted. I de-
cided that maybe this was something I would 
be interested in," he said. 

So without any formal experience c. 
coachin& in the game. Romey set out to 
become UCSO's farst major football stu last 

fall. Unfortunately, he had to 
compete for the staning kick-
ingjobwiththesonofWash-
ington State Head Coach 
Mike Price. 

The closest the Triton soc-
cer sensation would get to 
the National Football League 
would be 50-yard line seats 
in the Seattle Seahawks' 
Kingdome. 

Romey' 5 recovering el-
bow kept him from playing 
any soccer unlil the winter 
months, when he and some 
friends tried to form a club 
team. But his briefstay in the 
Northwestlumed out to be a 

SenIor",n CbM 1IoIMr. lifter.,.. oft, ................. In tGtIIldnta (27), 
year-long break from any real soccer com-
petition. 

"Washington State wu a lot different In 
San Diego, people complain when you have 
10 put on a sweatshirt. But up there, then: is 
snow on the ground three c. four IDQIlths a 
year. It was all right, but I am IIId I'm back: 
in San Oie80," the senior said. 

It was a strange return to UCSO for the 
forwud. "I knew maybe eight guys OIl the 
team. I bad never met most of them, and that 
was kind of weird," he said. But Romey hu 
quickly adjusted, even if he claims DOl to 
know what's going on. 

"I had never thought about being the 
leading scorer. I didn't know two years Igo 
until someone told me at the end of the 
season. I just do whatever I cm," be said. 

Whit he can do has been the major differ-
ence in the TrilOrts' strong start this seuon. 
"He ~ very important for us," Armstrong 
said. "He's a leader both on the field and in 
the locker room. It's a pity he only has one 
year left" 

His leadership may be u important to 
UCSD as his offensive skills. He wu a 
unanimous choice for team captain, some-

thing Armstrong wu admit-
tedly nervous about 

"I was a bit unsure in the 
beginning, but nOl any more. 
He takes charJe and respon-
sibility and il hopefully set-
ting an example for next 
year," the cOich said. 

Hi. own rise to success 
has made Romey uneuy. 

"I don't see myself al 
good. I'm just in the right 
place It the right time. I 
couldn't do anything with-
out the other JUYI on the 
team," he said . 

"But I would feel more 
comfortable if we bad some 
other sann. A lot of teams 
have trouble sbootin, be-
c:aUIC &hey'n: always look-
iDa fc.lClIneIbina heuer. But 
if you'n: not Ioina to tate a 

shot, you on: just mining an opportunity. " 
Armstrong agreel, "He bas scored most 

of the goall this year, 10 if we lose him we'll 
be left vulnerable. " the cOlCh said when 
questioDed about how tile pouibility of in-
JUJy to the Tritons ° main offensive thrust 
might affect the team. 

But the coach ian't asking Romey to 
change anythinl. '1Ie should just keep ~ 
ing what be's doing. He can 'tgive anything 
else." 

"He knows what be wants to do. He 
knows what his abilities are. and he does a 
gn:atjob without trying to overdo it, "UCSD 
goalkeeper Michael Madden said 

Madden's shutout against Westmoot wu 
partially caused by Romey and his fellow 
forwud's oulStanding play in UCSD's 2-0 
victory over previously-undefeated 
Westmont on Friday. "We needed help on 
defense and the forwards shut them down up 
field. " Madden said. 

Another advantage for Romey is his size. 
Listed at 6'3" and 225 pounds, he might 
have had a better chance of making the team 
as a tight end instead of a kicker at Washing-
ton State. "He just scares people with how 
big he is," Madden said. 

His size belies his temperament, accord-
ing to Armstroog. "He exemplifies every-
thing good about the program," the coach 
said. "He plays honestly and doesn't have 
any nutinesa in him. He'l just a bi, honey 
bear." 

The Tritons' great start this year hu in-
evitably led to COmpuiSODS between the 
1991 championship squad and this year's 
aspiring team. 

"Everyone talks about it, but there's no 
CompuilOn. This is a different style of play 
and dilferent guys. After the Cal State San 
Bernardino game (a 3-0 lou) we said 'uh-
ob.' But we're a YOUDI team and we've 
started to fipre thinal OUL Now, everyone 
wants to do well and have a ,ood time 
playin •• 

"But we still have six extremely impor-
tant pmea to JO. As lana u we keep work-
ina hint and Illy totetber • a,..p, there'l 
notbin. IhilIeIID can 't do," Romey said

MEN'S SOCCER: UCSD blanks 
peviously Wlbeaten Westmont, 2-0, 
to improve season record to 10-2-1 
By BrIan Il Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Warriors, shmorriors. So what if Westtnont 
College commanded an II-game unbeaten 
streak? Who cares that their starting goalie car-

ried a 0.45 goals against av-
erage? 

The Triton men's soccer 
team was about as intimidated 
by the Warriors' impressive 
accomplishments as they 
would be by a 65-year-old 
Pel~ threatening to come out 
of retiremenL 

, UCSD dominated the pre-
viously- unbeaten Westmont 
College squad (10-1-1) last 

Friday. A capacity "psyched-up" home crowd 
cheered the Tritons to a 2-0 steamrolling of the 
Warriors to improve their season record to 10-2-
1. 

Sophomore Joel Kosakoff got the ball rolling 
for the Tritons 18:18 into the fll'st half. 

After Westtnont defender Marty Mathiesen 
was called for a penalty about 22 YlI'ds out. the 
second-year midfielder set up for a free kick. 
Kosakoff launched a rocket shot through the 
Warriors' wall defense.The shot ricocheted off 
one of the defenders' ankles, spun left and scooted 
past charging Westmont goalkeeper Aldan Cole, 
giving the Tritons a 1-0 advantage. 

No Triton soccer game would be complete 
without a Chris Romey scoring appearance. 
Romey, never roe to let his team or his fans 
down. netted another mindboggling goal 33:46 
into the game. 

With the Warrior defense attempting an 
offside trap, Kosakoff drilled a beautifully lofted

"[The game] was a great result for us," 
Annstrong said. "We played a bit more conser-
vatively and it paid off. We wen: more patient 
than we have been ,in the past. We took [the 
Warriors] out of their normal game." 

Armstrong praised the depth of this yell" S 
team, but noted that "we didn't make very many 
substitutions. I didn't want to upset the balance of 
the way we were playing out there." 

"Our back defenden did a great job. Our 
freshman are starting to show a little bit," 
Armstrong said. 

Westmont got off only four shots on the stifling 
Triton defense and goalkeeper Michael Madden, 
who recorded his fourth shut out of the year. 

"This was a good comparison game f<r us," 
Armstrong said. "[Westmrot] beat Cal Lutheran 
3-2. Cal [Lutheran] will be a big game for us." 

"It was a good win for us," Romey said. 
"They have beaten some of the teams we have to 
face corning up. This shows we have a good 
chance against those other tough teams."
