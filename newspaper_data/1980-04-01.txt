F'or the half.century lince 
Black American. began.

had been a divided I

Detroit has changed itself, 
through a combination of 
economic and social 
erOCeiaea, the election of a 
Black majority government 
committed to bi·racial rule, 
and a fundamental tran.for· 
mation of ill police and 
criminal court Iy.tems. 

The mOlt .triking lign of 
change has been a valt 
reduction in the number of 
White Oetroiterl abandoning 
the city, along with a notable 
increaae in those deciding to 
return. Generally speaking, 
thil il not the procel' of 
"gentrification" in which an 
affluent middle cia.. has 
reclaimed picturelque 
neighborhood. from poor 
Blacks in luch cities as San 
Fr8llCi.co and Philadelphia. 
Detroit'l luburban exodus Will 
largely blue collar in 
character. And regarcless of 
the anxieties under~'in1 it, that 
exodus limply became too 
expenaive for workintl cJau 
people to lu.tain in a 
threatened economy. 

Moreover, nys F' ord 
employee Sam Ciaramatero, 
the homel .8oing up in 
exclulively White outiyi"i 
communities like Warren and 
Sterling Heighll "COlt 
575,000 and aren't worth it. 
They're poorly.conltructed, 
poorly·inlulated, and COlt a 
fortune to heat. I Itayed where 
I wal and I haven't re8l'etted it 
for a moment." 

Slaying in the city, 
according to FHA expert Tom 
Carey, meant "bei", able to

brick home in a pleasant 
neipborhood for $15,000." 
In ahart, the Iotic 01 the 
marketplace helped brin,

What makes that develop· 
menl even more noteworthy is 
the long grim hiatory which

How to Get Back 
ASecurity Deposit 

BY JUU BAIRD 
The mOlt common landIord.tenan!J'robiem that CalPiRG 

hear. about illoll aecurity depolill. There are iaWI to protect 
you, the tenant, from illegal practices by landlord.. 

Following are a few explanationl of tennl used in rental 
agreemenll. Underltanding your rental agreement and the 
Jaw can mean the difference between getting your <!epo';t 
back or loaing it. Here are a few tiPI on how to avoid aecurity 
depolit problema and what to do about them if they do arise. 

The aecurity, cleaning, key, pet, parking and varioulother 
depllits should aU be conlidered as the aecurity depolil "The 
.ecurity depotit can be apptied aa a) compenaation for unpaid 
rent, b) repair of damages cauaed by the tenant (excludlng 
normal wear and tear), and c) cleaning that needl to be done 
that the tenant failed 10 do. 

The definition of "normal wear and tear" i. not pecifically 
defined by law and il left up 10 the judge if you go 10 Small 
Claims Court. For example, if the curtains are dirty from 
simply hanging in the apartment for 1 year , that would mo t 
likely be considered normal wear and tear. If, however, they 
had a coffee stain which you were responsible for , it would 
then be up 10 you to get the curtains cleaned or to pay for the 
damage. A landlord cannot automatically chart(e for any 
cleaning or painting simply beeauae that is his/her policy 
when a tenant moves out. 

Don't confuae the aecurity depolit with a "holding" deposit 
which is the money given 10 a landlord to hold the residence 
forlou until the first month'l rent and aecurity deposit are 
pai in full. A "holding" deposit is usUally non· refundable but 
il normally applied to the fir.t month's rent. Make lure you 
get the terms of your "holding" deposit in writing. 

When you find the place you want to rent, go over the 
premise I very carefully and mark down all damages on a 
checkli.t. Have the landlord lign the ~st 10 you cannot be held 
respon.ible for thoae damages when you move. Some 
apartmenll provide you with a checklill. If that's the cale, 
keep a copy, Ii8ned by the landlord for your own recordl. If 
the landlord won't sign the lilt, have WltneSsel to the damagel 
and take pictures of the damaged furniahing., dating the back 
of the pictures for your own protection. 

According to the California Civil Code Section 1950.5it il 
illegal for a aecurity deposit to be non·refundable. An 
example of a non·refundable aecurity depolit i. a rental 
agreement that has a clause stating that the tenant forfeits aU 
or part of the deposit if (s)he moves out before a de.ignated 
time hal elapsed. Section 1946 requires that you give a 30 
day written notice when you are moving if you pay rent once 
a month. 

After you have moved out, the 30 day notice hal been 

A landlord ccmnot automatically 
charge lor any cleaning .imply 
becau.e that i. hi./her policy. 

aiven your rent hal been fully paid, the apartment hal been 
thoroughly cleaned and you have not caused any damages, 
the landlord i. then reqwred, by law, 10 return your aecurity 
deposit within fwo week. after you have moved out. If the 
landlord keepa any portion of your depoait, within two week. 
(.)he must provide you with a written, detailed accounting of 
how the unreturned portion ol your depoait was used. 

If you do not receive the full deposit or partial deposit WIth 
an itemized accounting of what the balance was applied to 
within the Iwo week period, write your landlord a formal 
buaineas·like letter. Ask for response and/or payment Wlth~ 
five working days after receipt of your letter, and alate that 
you will purlUe thi matter through lellal channell if need be. 
Keep a copy of the letter and send the original to your lanclord 
by certified mail ¥,;th a return receipt requested. You may alto 
wish to remind your landlord that <.)he can be held liable for 
up to 5200 in punitive damqes. 

If your landlord does not respond within the lime requested, 
you can, if you with, .tart a Small Oaim. Court Suit. It i. 
important to know that you have to represent yOW'Hif in 
Small Caim. Court, which mean. tl.!at if.you move out 01 the 
area, you have 10 Mum 10 utili. SrnaI Claim. Court. The

It is with deep pride and a continuing sense of loss that we dedicate the Spring, 1980 
Political Film Series to our departed teacher and campa nero, Joseph Sommers, on 
the first anniversary of his death. Professor of Latin American Literature and 
Chairman of the Department, Joe Sommers was a great student and proponent of 
Chicano Literature and a tireless fighter for the rights of the opporessed - fro m his 
early days as a labor organizer and his appearance before the McCarthy pands to his 
ItrUales on behalf of Farmworkers, Chilean refugees and progressive Latin 
American intellectuals. His life was a life devoted to the ideals for which we still 

struSKle, inaplred and strengthened by his example.
