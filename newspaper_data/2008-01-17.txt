Following strong opposition and 
allegations of unconstitutionality, the 
committee charged with reviewing the 
university’s free-speech policy revision 
decided at its Jan. 10 meeting to scratch 
the controversial draft policy and await 
a new student-crafted version.

Over 170 people commented on the 
revision, with over half of respondents 
voicing protest against any type of regu-
lation that outlines permitted  forms of 
expression.

In November, an eight-page letter 
was sent to UCSD by the San Diego 
chapter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union, contending that 10 sections of 
the policy were unconstitutional.

The 16-member revision commit-
tee, which consists of administrators, 
faculty, two A.S. councilmembers and 
one representative from the Graduate 
Student Association, met for the first 
time on Jan. 10 to introduce new mem-
bers, review the revision’s history and 
determine a timetable for tasks it needs 
to accomplish this year, according to 
committee Chair Sally Brainerd. 

The committee acknowledged the 
importance of supporting expression 
and advocacy on campus, and agreed 
to completely rewrite the new policy 
without being wedded to the previous 
draft, Brainerd said.

Students to Lead Free-Speech Revision

Six-Part Plan Aims to Define UC Admin Roles
See SPEECH, page 7

By Jaclyn Snow
Senior Staff Writer

After last year’s call for an administrative overhaul of 
the University of California, a UC-commissioned working 
group presented a report outlining organizational changes  it 
felt should be made to the university system’s often-criticized 
Office of the President.

The report, released at the Jan. 8 UC Board of Regents 
meeting, made recommendations on ways to clarify and 
organize the structure of UCOP, which has been chastised 
by UC Regents Chairman Richard Blum as a system weighed 
down by bureaucracy.

The working group framed most of its suggestions 
around how to streamline and update the methods UCOP 
uses to interact with the chancellors and regents. The report 
clarified and narrowed the regents’ roles, and suggested ways 
to make them more efficient in those roles. It also proposed 
a reconfiguration of UCOP, along with six mechanisms to 
ensure the changes. Members of the working group, which 
included two regents, stressed the importance of restoring 
the public’s credibility in the UC.

The six mechanisms included two-way accountability, 
clear decision rights, better communication between UCOP 
and the university’s 10 campuses as well as more modern 
and timely management systems.

UCOP spokesman Paul Schwartz said the reports’ pro-
posals were intentionally left broad so that the board could 
identify points that needed to be addressed. More concrete 
solutions will be discussed at later meetings, he added.

At their Jan. 16 meeting, the regents applauded the work-
ing group’s thoroughness but were quick to point out that 
the report did not delve deep enough into clear definitions 
of their roles.

“I am 100 percent behind this,” said Regent Judith L. 
Hopkinson, who added that defining regents’ roles would See WARREN, page 3

Claims of Frat Hazing Spark 
Several Investigations

By Kimberly Cheng
Associate News Editor

University administrators are initi-
ating an investigation into allegations 
of fraternity hazing after receiving new 
evidence this past weekend from an 
anonymous former Sigma Nu pledge. 
The latest investigation joins others 
already underway by the national head-
quarters of at least one other campus 
fraternity.

Several months after the former 
pledge submitted e-mail evidence of 
alleged hazing to a UCSD student 
organizations adviser and three fra-
ternities’ national headquarters, the 
university has yet to release details 
about the status of the pending inves-
tigation.

Recent hazing accusations targeted 
the Sigma Nu fraternity, but the most 
recent evidence — which includes a 
number of Facebook pictures — also 
documents apparent hazing among Pi 
Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi fraterni-
ties. 

UCSD Student Organizations 
Adviser Marilyn Russell acknowledged 
that there was an “ongoing investiga-
tion,” but said university policy prohib-
ited the release of information pertain-

allow them to better do their jobs.
Regent Eddie Island said he did not think the report got 

to the heart of the university’s problems, which he stressed 
were rooted in the bureaucratic complexity that the regents 
face. Regent George Marcus added that that issue needs to 
be addressed “so we can concentrate on our business, not the 
business of the business.”

Other board members said that tips for new regents 
would also be useful in helping them transition into the jobs 
and make them more efficient.

“What would be really helpful would be something that 
defined the regents … some basics do’s and don’ts for new 
regents,” said Regent Bruce D. Varner, who was appointed to 
the board by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006.

The report included a description of the president’s 
role, which will aid the regents’ search to replace outgoing 
President Robert C. Dynes, who will step down in June or 
when a successor is found. 

The regents also expressed hope that streamlining UCOP 
would help with the 10-percent budget cut Schwarzenegger 
announced last week. In his proposal, Schwarzenegger rec-
ommended that 10 percent of the $332 million dollar reduc-
tion to the UC’s budget next year come from administrative 
spending.

When asked for a schedule of implementing the changes, 
Regent Leslie Tang Schilling said she was pushing an “ambi-
tious timeline” that the regents would vote on at the next 
meeting. She urged the rest of the regents to provide input 
on the report before that time.

“I am hopeful that in March we will be able to codify 
something,” Schilling said.

In August, Blum released a report that called for change 
in a system he said had not been updated in 40 years. The 
working group was formed by UC Provost Wyatt R. Hume 
to address some of the problems Blum raised about UCOP 
operations. 

The Monitor Group, an external agency commissioned 
by university officials to perform an internal review, had also 
called for an “organizational restructuring effort.”

ing to active inquiries.
The informant said that he had sub-

mitted similar allegations in November 
2007, spurring the national headquar-
ters to launch an inquiry. However, he 
said he was not contacted for an inter-
view by any campus administrators.

Justin Buck, executive director at Pi 
Kappa Alpha’s national headquarters, 
said that while his organization had 
already performed its own investiga-
tion two months ago, he would soon be 
commissioning a second.

“We found that the pictures that 
were sent to us did not constitute haz-
ing, and the chapter assured us at the 
time that the events did not involve 
hazing,” Buck said.

Some of the pictures, however, 
depict pledges being forcibly fed bot-
tles of hard liquor while blindfolded. 
Another picture show a pledge tied up 
with rope and duct tape, while others 
show pledges unconscious or vomit-
ing. 

“I’ll need to look at the pictures 
again,” Buck said. “We are going to 
investigate this issue again. We will 
be in touch with the campus and the 
president of PIKE. I cannot speculate 

“The committee is approaching 
the development of the policy from a 
blank slate,” she said. “Some sections of 
the policy could be removed altogether 
and others could be retained. It is too 
early to tell.”

members, Tara Ramanathan and 
Carol-Irene Southworth, along with 
graduate student Benjamin Balthaser, 
volunteered to write a new proposal 
with the help of various student orga-
nizations, including the Coalition for See HAZING, page 7

University Exceeds Five 
Million eScholarship Hits

The University of California 
announced this week that its widely 
used eScholarship Repository sur-
passed the five-million mark for full-
text downloads of its open access 
scholarly content. 

This milestone reflects the 
impressive adoption and usage 
rate the repository has seen since 
its inception in 2002, with UC 
academic units and departments 
from its 10 campuses publishing 
or depositing more than 20,000 
papers and works. 

The repository houses a broad 
range of scholarly content and pro-
vides a publishing platform for pre-
prints, post-prints, peer-reviewed 
articles, edited volumes and peer-
reviewed journals.

The usage rate of these mate-
rials has grown exponentially in 
the past five years and now often 
exceeds 55,000 full-text downloads 
per week.

The eScholarship Repository 
represents one of the university’s 
most successful and sustained 
efforts to improve and offer inno-
vative alternatives to the scholarly 
publishing system, which struggles 
to serve the needs and require-
ments of the academic community.

“We’re very excited about the 
uptake and use of the eScholar-
ship Repository at the University of 
California,” said Catherine Candee, 
executive director of strategic pub-
lishing and broadcast services at 
UC Office of the President, in a 
press release. “Our open access 
publishing platform represents a 
critical component of UC’s broad-

er effort to strengthen university-
based publishing services and 
integrate them into the research, 
teaching and public service mission 
of the university.”

 
UCSD Partners With 

Outpatient Surgery Center

The growing number of surger-
ies at UCSD Medical Center has 
prompted the hospital to team up 
with an Alabama-based provider of 
specialty surgical services’ facility 
in La Jolla.  

The facility, renamed the 
University Ambulatory Surgery 
Center after the partnership was 
announced late last month, will act 
as the headquarters for outpatient 
surgeries normally performed at 
Thornton Hospital. 

It will continue to be man-
aged by Surgical Care Affiliates of 
Birmingham, Ala.  

Approximately 3,000 to 4,000 
outpatient surgeries will be per-
formed at the surgery center each 
year, said Brendan Kremer, admin-
istrative director of muscular, skel-
etal and surgical services at UCSD 
Medical Center, in a press release. 

The surgery center has three 
operating rooms and will focus on 
orthopedics, pain management, 
ophthalmology, general surgery, 
otolaryngology, urology, plastics 
and podiatry procedures. Over the 
last three years, UCSD Medical 
Center has reported a 23-percent 
increase in outpatient procedures, 
according to Kremer.

Terms of the deal were not dis-
closed. This is the first time that 
UCSD Medical Center has partnered 
with a surgical services provider.   UC SDGUA RD I AN . O RG

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND

course requirement.
In addition, students pursuing a B.S. 

in engineering will be required to take 
one more upper-division area of study 
course, where a lower-division course 
was previously acceptable. A lower-
division ethics and society class, offered 
through the philosophy and political 
science departments, will be restruc-
tured into a two-course sequence.

Warren Provost Steven Adler has 
been examining the general educa-
tion requirements since he began his 
term in 2004. In collaboration with 
the Warren Executive Committee of 
the Faculty, Adler had been discuss-
ing changes in the current curriculum 
since May 2007. 

“Requirements need to change and 
evolve because they should reflect the 
faculty’s wisdom as to where education 
should go at any given time,” Adler said. 
“We were determining whether the 
general education requirements were 
still serving our needs, which is inex-
tricably linked to an examination of 
Warren’s identity.”

While these changes are not dras-
tic, they would enrich students with a 
deeper understanding of Warren’s mis-
sion statement through an additional 
course in ethics, and decrease the gap 
in requirement distinctions between 
engineering and nonengineering stu-
dents, he said.

“We felt that the extra quarter of 
ethics and society would better serve 
the students with a greater foundation 
in ethics,” Adler said. “The other four 
proposals would make the students’ 
education better well-rounded. It’s to 
give our students a better education, to 

Last night’s A.S. Council meet-ing was full of variations on a theme of sustainability. Two 
special presentations focused on cli-
mate protection and environmentally 
friendly transportation. The conserva-
tion of “W” marks, a precious resource 
for students facing insurmountably 
difficult midquarter course work, was 
also addressed.

Sustainability Coordinator Maggie 
Souder provided an overview of 
UCSD’s future as a green campus. 
Souder touched on matters of green 
building design, composting and waste 
reduction efforts.

She said that in 
response to envi-
ronmental con-
cerns first raised 
by the UC Board 
of Regents in 2002, 
the campus aims 
to to eliminate 100 
percent of waste sent to landfills by 
2020. That figure currently stands at 
37 percent.

Souder also discussed UCSD’s par-
ticipation in “Focus the Nation” on 
Jan. 31, a nationwide global warming 
awareness campaign. She said that 
UCSD will be lighting a large, elec-
trified “You have the power” sign in 
honor of the event. The display’s design 
may involve a polar bear — hopefully 
a symbolic one — to draw attention to 
the consequences the species has suf-
fered from global warming.

Following in Souder’s footsteps, 
representatives from the All Campus 
Commuter Board presented infor-
mation about the impending park-
ing crunch and the need for alterna-
tive forms of transportation. Despite 
an expected enrollment increase of 
approximately 5,300 students by 2012-
13, the number of parking spaces is 
projected to decrease by 1,600.

The representatives covered the req-

uisite bullet points of green transporta-
tion, focusing primarily on carpooling, 
UCSD’s Pedal Club for bicyclists and a 
suggestion to expand the range of the 
student bus pass to include all of San 
Diego by raising student fees.

The ACCB representatives were 
united in their opposition to the con-
struction of a new parking structure 
and echoed Souder’s earlier observa-
tion that it is “ridiculous to think about 
building more parking spaces when we 
should be using fewer of them.”

Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Long Pham 

reported that 
the Committee 
on Educational 
Policy approved 
a proposal to 
modify the class 
withdrawal policy. 
Under the propos-
al, students will 

not be allowed to have more than one 
“W” mark per class.

All Campus Senator Utsav Gupta 
announced that he was forming a foot-
ball feasibility taskforce to investigate 
the possibility of an intercollegiate 
football team at UCSD, and was met 
with polite, albeit tepid, approval from 
councilmembers.

Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Neetu Balram warned 
the council about the potential per-
ils of writing an essay without doing 
the required reading. According to 
her, that qualifies as earning a grade 
through dishonest means and opens 
up the possibility of academic dishon-
esty allegations.

Pham gingerly asked if “skimming” 
books fell under the definition of dis-
honest means, but Balram did not have 
a specific answer. She did, however, 
clarify that the cherished tradition of 
“Sparknoting” qualified as dishonest 
— to the sound of nervous laughter.

make them better scholars and to pre-
pare them for the challenges they will 
encounter after they graduate.” 

CEP, the division of the Academic 
Senate that oversees any course changes 
requested by colleges or departments, 
voted 8-1 on Dec. 7 to approve the 
changes. The only dissenting voter 
was the committee’s sole undergradu-
ate representative, A.S. Associate Vice 
President of Academic Affairs Long 
Pham, who said that his vote represent-
ed students’ sentiments on the issue. 

“I tried to convey what I heard, 
which was that students generally 
didn’t want these additional classes,” 
Pham said. 

CEP Chair Kim Griest said that 
the committee considered Pham’s argu-
ments, but that the colleges have the 
primary responsibility of determining 
the kind of education they want to 
offer.

“Since the college had already voted 
and gone through this whole process 
to make this change, we believe that 
colleges and departments should be 
able to create the kind of education that 

they want,” Griest said. “We are just 
the monitoring body. We just check to 
make sure that everything is fair.” 

Griest said that the proposal under-
scored the need to create an identity in 
Warren’s core courses, which the course 
changes would help to expand.

“They argued that it was a step in 
the right direction,” he said. “Warren 
has always been a bit of an anomaly. 
It always had less general education 
requirements than the other colleges.”

Pham presented the changes to 
WCSC on Jan. 10, where councilmem-
bers expressed mixed reactions to the 
news. Contrary to their initial under-
standing of the meeting, Pham was 
there to inform them of the changes, 
not to obtain their input.

WCSC Chair Alex Miller said that 
the student body is supposed to be 
included in the decision-making pro-
cess for issues relevant to its colleges. 

“Student input has always been 
given in the past,” Miller said. “The 
only thing we have seen specifically 
was talk of the first point. Everything 
else was floated by the council in the 
past couple of years. So, my problem 
is that no student was introduced to 
this specific proposal before it’s been 
approved.”

Because the proposal requires 
changes in the bylaws, it must pass 
through the Academic Senate. If the 
Academic Senate approves the pro-
posal this year, the changes will take 
effect in Fall Quarter 2009. 

“It certainly would not affect any 
student currently enrolled,” Adler said.

on outcomes at this time.”
The e-mails also included a 

Facebook wall-to-wall conversation 
between a PIKE brother and a pledge in 
which the brother threatens the pledge 
with the “elephant walk,” a hazing ritual 
that requires the pledges to walk in a 
circle while holding on to the genitalia 
of the person behind them.

“PIKE brothers’ response was to pre-
tend nothing ever happened and hope 
the allegations go away once everybody 
denies them,” said the former Sigma 
Nu pledge, who requested anonymity 
for fear of retaliation. “Unfortunately, 
the pictures of PIKE hazing are the 
most conclusive of all. A student who 
knows nothing about Greek life could 
see them and instantly know that they 
were hazing photos.”

PIKE’s pledge process consists of 
events called “big bro revealing” and 
“tuck-ins,” the informant said. During 
“big bro revealing,” pledges are given 
a “family drink” of hard liquor and 
instructed by their “big bro” to drink 
the entire bottle. A “tuck-in” occurs 
when a “big sis” reads a children’s story-
book, and the pledge must take a shot 
of liquor whenever a word of choice 

Students May Face Suspension if  Found Guilty
▶ HAZING, from page 1 is read.

“Usually, the word is something that 
will occur many times,” he said. “On 
average, a pledge takes about 12 to 25 
shots during a tuck-in.” 

Similarly, Sigma Nu’s process of “big 
sis revealing” requires the blindfolded 
pledge to consume large amounts of 
beer before the blindfold is removed 
and his “big sis” is revealed.

“It is not what it seems to an out-
sider,” said a Pi Beta Phi member who 
also requested to remain anonymous. 
“I think the big sis process is actu-
ally a positive event in a new Greek 
member’s life, because they are placed 
in the trusting hands of someone 
who will nurture them through their 
years at UCSD. What is constituted as 
‘hazing’ at our schools does not even 
come close to other schools’ Greek 
systems.”

In addition, each Sigma Nu pledge 
is given a “pledge book” that consists 
of the history of the fraternity as well 
as a list of all active brothers. In order 
to be initiated, a pledge must interview 
and obtain the signatures of every 
brother.

“Unfortunately, in many cases the 
interview book does not serve its 

intended purpose of helping pledges 
get to know the brothers,” the infor-
mant said. “The brothers will say 
things like, ‘I’ll sign your interview 
book if you drink this beer, take a 
shot, etc.”

According to the informant, Sigma 
Chi forced its pledges to drink as much 
Rossi wine as possible in a “Rossi train” 
before passing the bottle to the next 
pledge. The bottles had to be empty 
by the time it reached the last person 
in the train. 

“I would say other pledges definite-
ly acquiesced to the brothers’ demands 
out of fear,” the former Sigma Nu pledge 
said. “Fear of both being reprimanded 
[or] blackballed and fear of not being 
accepted. Basically, they have to trade 
in their dignity to have the type of 
social life they envisioned when they 
entered college.” 

Russell said that fraternities found 
guilty of hazing could face any number 
of possible sanctions, including coun-
seling, fines, academic suspension or 
probation and loss of status as regis-
tered student organizations.

Policy Could Be Ready for Review by May
▶ SPEECH, from page 1 “The proposed revisions were 

neither constitutional or just,” 
Southworth said. “The current policy 
that is in place has problems … but 
we are looking forward to working 
with it and creating a policy that 
works and upholds our constitutional 
freedoms.”

The student proposal will be pre-
sented at the next committee meet-
ing, scheduled for Jan. 31. The com-
mittee will also discuss and affirm 
values that should be upheld in the 
policy, according to Brainerd.

“The policy on free speech is a 

sensitive issue and will be scruti-
nized both internally and externally,” 
Brainerd said. “For that reason, the 
committee agreed that the first step 
would be to determine if the values of 
individual members would match the 
values that are required to develop 
and issue a policy on free speech.”

The committee is hoping to release 
a draft for campus review by May and 
finalize the policy before the end of 
the academic year, Ramanathan said.

Ithink Renaissance scholar Baldassare Castiglione was the first person in history to endorse 
the classic smile-and-nod technique 
used so often at cocktail parties across 
the country. When confronted with a 
conversation about something com-
pletely foreign to you, Castiglione said 
a true gentleman always pretends to 
know what the other is talking about. 
Duly noted. 

Following Castiglione’s word, I 
pulled the trusty smile-and-nod sev-
eral weeks ago. While watching an 
evening news show with a friend of 
mine, the newsanchor casually lik-
ened a tense political imbroglio to the 
book “Catch-22.”

My friend let out a solemn “hmm” 
and I had no choice but to do the 
same. Apparently, much to the delight 
of my friend, I was in complete agree-
ment. But of course, like most of my 
knee-jerk social reactions, it was a big 
mistake. My tacit familiarity with the 
book prompted a frighteningly unex-
pected conversation about “Catch-22” 
— a novel I haven’t read. 

Oh, the travails of true gentlemen. 
Don’t get me wrong; I am liter-

ate and have read my fair share of 
books, but I’ll admit 97 percent of 
these are exclusively nonfiction. The 
remaining 3 percent is made up of the 
impenetrable kind of fiction I had to 
read in high school, the first Harry 
Potter installment and an ill-advised 
decision to familiarize myself with 
Faulkner at the naive age of 12. For all 
I know, maybe it was Faulkner who 
forever eroded my interest in fiction. 
But in any case, “Catch-22” never 
made it to my bookshelf. 

That’s not to say I had never before 
heard of the storied novel. In fact, it 
seems to be a very popular allusion 
in the media. I also know it’s fairly 
common for English speakers to use 
words and phrases derived from so-
called classic works of literature, some 
words no stranger to a handful of my 
recent papers: Herculean (“strong,”

As hazing allegations continue in the Sigma Nu saga — with Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma 
Chi now under similar suspicions — 
and the fraternities’ respective national 
headquarters continue investigations, 
one question remains unanswered: 
Where has UCSD’s administration 
been?  

The former Sigma Nu pledge 
responsible for bringing the alleged 
hazing to light was all but ignored by 
UCSD’s Student Organizations Adviser 
Marilyn Russell when he brought 
evidence to her in November 2007. 
Regardless of the severity of the cited 
events and photos, Russell is responsi-
ble for investigating all such allegations 
so that pledges to the Greek system can 
remain protected.

Students in the Sigma Nu camp are 
laughing off the allegations, claiming 
— perhaps accurately — that no hazing 
took place and that the events in ques-
tion were all in good fun. Meanwhile, 
there is a growing stockpile of evidence 
suggesting the opposite. But the bottom 
line is that no matter what information 
was brought to Russell, a concerned 

student came to her asking that she do 
her job and investigate the situation. 
That is exactly what she should have 
done. Instead, she originally did noth-
ing about the evidence submitted to 
her, never responded to the informant 
and failed to move the investigation 
forward in any meaningful way.

After two months, the story insti-
gated questions from the public and 
media, the national headquarters of 
those fraternities involved stepped up 
their respective investigations and the 
informant contacted Russell a second 
time — then, she finally decided to start 
doing her job.

This kind of negligence from a uni-
versity official is unacceptable. Not only 
did Russell let the scandal fester by 
failing to respond, she is still unable to 
provide students with an explanation 
for the university’s lack of involvement 
in the matter. Though there is now 
an “ongoing investigation,” UCSD has 
failed to issue an official statement or 
reach any solid conclusions. By drag-
ging their feet instead of working to 
make things more transparent, UCSD 
administrators have sent a clear and 

unfortunate message about their com-
mitment to students.

No matter the eventual outcome, 
it is shocking that this turn of events 
was handled so carelessly. The degree 
of disinterest shown here for even 
addressing the informant’s concerns, 
and the standing of the Greek system 
in general, is appalling. It is Russell’s 
job to investigate issues as they come to 

light, and it is questionable why some-
one so obviously irresponsive would be 
trusted with such a weighty task. 

The UCSD administrators respon-
sible for overseeing student organiza-
tions have completely dropped the ball, 
and with so much at stake it looks like 
the Center for Student Involvement — 
particularly Russell’s office — deserves 
an investigation of its own.

In Sigma Nu Case, Admins’ Lack of Oversight Fails All

State Budget Demands Belt-Tightening from Regents
The ambitious verve that sold Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to California’s voters is going 
up in flames: No amount of ambition 
can overcome the state’s $14-billion 
deficit. Now that Sacramento’s law-
makers are reconciling their dreams 
with harsh fiscal realities, officials 
from the University of California 
must do the same with the intense 
financial scrutiny. This week’s UC 
Board of Regents meeting should be 
the site of that wake-up attitude.

Short $400 million in expected 
state funding, the university’s regents 
are now charged with the heady task 
of trimming financial fat. The prob-
lem is that the system is already dead 
skinny from year after year of shrink-
ing state support. Students themselves 
have felt the pinch: bigger classes, less 
programs, less services and higher 
fees.

Amid this clamor, UC President 
Robert C. Dynes is presenting his 
Long-Range Plan for the system, a 
collection of initiatives and goals that 
will set the groundwork for advance-
ment. Academic growth is one over-
arching initiative, which Dynes pro-
poses should be achieved by upping 
faculty salaries to market-competitive 
levels. The problem? It will cost $263 
million over four years. The same 
problem goes for Dynes’ hope to see 
technology infrastructure supported 
by state finances, a move with a one-

time pricetag of over $300 million in 
improvements. 

The plan, presented Jan. 15 at the 
regents’ meeting, will require major 
readjustments that take the state’s 
newfound crisis into consideration. 

So where should this fat be cut 
from? A heavy money-spender is the 
university’s collection of academic 
preparation programs, which form its 
main outreach tool. The Legislature 
blocked Schwarzenegger’s move to 
cut the programs by $19.3 million; 
it’s a repeated move from years past, 
when he demanded the university 
report on the effectiveness of out-
reach. 

This year sees a complete turn-
around, with outreach receiving more 
money and less oversight (the gover-
nor vetoed language that would have 
demanded such accountability, though 
he encourages it). While accessibility is 
a major concern for the state’s universi-
ties, especially in today’s era of middle-
class malaise, this fiscally tight year 
marks the worst time to give outreach 
proponents free reign over their pro-
grams. Instead, the university needs to 
scrutinize its most efficient outreach 
tools, and funnel more money toward 
those efforts.

Many research projects have 
now been deemed extraneous: the 
Legislature rejected a proposal 
to expand funding to the system’s 
Institutes for Science and Innovation, 

while Schwarzenegger vetoed $1.5 
million for agricultural research 
and $1.5 million for oceanographic 
research. 

While it is heartbreaking to see 
such hallmark UC projects be down-
sized, it is necessary to preserve the 
core needs that should be addressed 
first: Enrollment growth must be 
sustained, ensuring accessibility for 
incoming students. 

At the same time, fees must 
remain at a reasonable level, or the 
university will see an exodus of stu-
dents fleeing the system for an edu-
cation that is worth its cost — the 
picture is sadly moving the other 
way.

Fluency, a 
Catch-22

See NOTA, page 5

By Marissa Blunschi
Associate Opinion Editor 

ACADEMICS  — For over two years, 
the faculty of Earl Warren College 
has considered adjusting the college’s 
general education requirements as a 
means of adding strength and depth 
to its undergraduate curriculum. 
Now, after months of holding fac-
ulty discussions, coordinating meet-
ings and approving the proposals to 
revamp their undergraduate require-

ments, Warren  administrators have 
finally decided to make their inten-
tions clear to students. Unfortunately, 
if those students disagree with the 
adjustments being implemented, 
their opinions and concerns will 
have hardly any impact on the matter 
— that is, if those opinions are even 
taken into account in the first place.  

Among the adjustments are addi-
tional requirements for transfer stu-
dents in their non-contiguous areas 
of study; an extra quarter of the ethics 
and society course; the integration 
of the formal skills requirement for 
humanities majors in the natural sci-
ence, math and engineering programs 
of concentration; and restrictions 
and revisions to the area of studies 
requirement for entering freshmen. 

Much to the disgruntlement of 
Warren College Student Council 

members and concerned under-
graduates, the viewpoints of students 
who actually have to take Warren 
GE requirements, and their person-
al judgments of how effective those 

courses are, have had absolutely no 
bearing on the decision-making 
process of curriculum adjustment. 
Student input should be significant, if 
not the most important of factors to 

be considered when it comes to mak-
ing adjustments to the status quo of 
current Warren requirements. 

It is a discredit to Warren College 
to neglect the vital opinions of its 
current students when gauging the 
effectiveness of educational strate-
gies — student opinion can be some 
of the most telling and indicative of 
how future students will be affected 
by change. 

Surprisingly, not only were current 
undergraduates not given the option 
of voicing their opinions about how 
GE requirements could be improved 
before the decision-making process 
was well underway, but the majority 
of them were never even informed 
about the proposed changes until 
after the decision to adopt them had 
been approved by the Committee of 
Educational Policy last month. 

Long Pham, the A.S. associate vice 
president of academic affairs, was 
the lone dissenting vote against the 
proposal to approve the additions and 
adjustments for GE requirements. It’s 
no coincidence that he is currently 
the only undergraduate student rep-
resentative who sits on the commit-
tee. Though Pham voiced his concern 
that students should be entitled to 
their input, the faculty on the com-
mittee easily overwhelmed his single 
vote of opposition.  

Until the proposal of changing 
the curriculum had been brought 
to the CEP to be voted on, Pham 
had no prior knowledge of the intent 
to adjust Warren GE requirements. 
Once Pham learned of the proposed 
changes, he brought them to the

Props to the A.S. Council and TritonLink 
administrators for finally instituting 
instant runoff voting, just in time for the 
council’s upcoming elections. 

Flops to Michigan for toying with the 
democratic process by rushing into a 

poorly organized primary, leading to low 
voter turnout overall.

Subprime Crisis Bleeds into Job Prospects

from Greek mythology), Lilliputian
(“very small,” from “Gulliver’s 
Travels”), chortle (“gleeful laugh,” 
from Lewis Carroll’s “Jabberwocky”) 
and, of course, the innumerable con-
tributions Shakespeare has made 
to the English language (“one fell 
swoop,” “tongue tied,” “no rhyme or 
reason,” etc.). 

In addition to literature, the king’s 
language has adopted words and 
expressions from a number of other 
sources, typically history (balkanize), 
mythology (Sisyphean), people (bowd-
lerize) and foreign languages. To be 
sure, the latter is often driven by pre-
tension or affectation, but occasionally 
there are times when a concept simply 
can’t be as precisely (or as economi-
cally) expressed in English as it can be 
with, for instance, German’s schaden-
freude (taking pleasure in others’ pain) freude (taking pleasure in others’ pain) freude
or Italian’s al dente (gastronomical 
term meaning “not too hard but not 
too soft”). 

Catch-22 is no exception. By using 
only one word, you encapsulate an 
entire situation, saving yourself a boat-
load of excess phraseology.

But one thing is still puzzling: How 
did Joseph Heller’s nonmythological, 
nonforeign, circa 1961 novel manage 
to circumvent that waiting period of 
100 or more years to be inducted into 
our vernacular? 

I valiantly took on the task. 
After a good deal of Wikipedia-ing, 
Sparknotes-ing and asking around, 
the meaning and concept of Catch-22
became clear. The book tells of a World 
War II Air Force squadron based on 
a small Italian island where airman 
and protagonist Yossarian is under the 
purview of some humorously inept 
superiors (one of whom is promoted 
to the rank of major thanks to a for-
tuitous computer glitch) who promise 
the pilots they can return home as 
soon as they finish a certain number 
of missions. 

Unfortunately, that number contin-

ues to increase, dashing the hopes of 
the homesick bombardiers. The only 
escape for these men is to be declared 
mentally unstable and thus incapable 
of flying. To do this, they must submit 
an exemption report; but in the eyes 
of their superiors, if one is cognizant 
enough to submit such a document, he 
is clearly not insane. Yes, that’s right, 
the airmen are in a Catch-22. 

When looking for work this past 
summer, I remember including my 
“permanent address” on some of the 
job applications. To apply for a job, it is 
clear you need a permanent residence, 
but to have one, don’t you need a job 
to pay for it? Where does that leave 
job-seeking people with no permanent 
address? Yup — another Catch-22.

Thanks to Wikipedia, Sparknotes, 
Castiglione and my TV-news-watch-
ing friend of superior intelligence, I am 
now enlightened: I will definitely make 
a point to throw around Catch-22 in 
conversation as if it were my job — no 
permanent residence required.

NATIONAL NEWS — Welcome to 
the jungle, 2008 graduates.

At the end of the academic year, 
many UCSD seniors will don their 
caps and gowns, rendezvous with 
college buddies and perhaps go to 
a party or two after graduation cer-
emonies come to a close. 

Then they’ll begin looking for 
jobs. And to their dismay, it may 
be much harder than usual to find 
vacancies thanks to the subprime 
loan crisis, which has contributed 
to the market’s recent softening for 
labor demand. 

The housing mess that started 
in fall 2006 has spread, big time. 
Billions of dollars in assets have been 

written down, or lost, by banks lend-
ing to borrowers with subprime (less 
than optimal) credit ratings. But just 
as people began to think the housing 
crisis would only affect those facing 
foreclosure notices, a new twist cour-
tesy of a vicious trend has reared its 
head: nationwide unemployment.

The U.S. Department of Labor 
just posted its December 2007 
unemployment readings. The read-
ing was 5 percent, up 0.3 percent 
from November and the highest 
reading in two years. Additionally, 
job creation was especially weak in 
December, at around only 18,000 
new jobs. That figure is the weakest 
since 2003, a year when the country 
was ascending out of a recession. 

As it stands today, the United 
States is closer to facing a recession 

than it was just a couple of months 
ago. And with a recession there inev-
itably comes a weakened job market, 
which is especially bad for recent 
college graduates. 

“Graduating in a recession leads 
workers to start at smaller and lower 
paying firms,” said Matt Nesvisky, 
contributor to the National Bureau 
of Economic Research. Thus, pend-
ing any improvements within the 
general job report, it appears 2008 
graduates will face a tougher-than-
usual task seeking the most coveted 
jobs. 

So what should a student do 
to hedge against the prospect of 
increasing weakness in labor 
demand? According to Nesvisky,

Web Site Facelift Ignores 
Structural Problems

Dear Editor, 
Regarding the Jan. 7 article entitled 

“Designers Credit New Philosophy 
for Revitalized Campus Web Site”, we 
would like to congratulate all involved 
on finishing this project. The effort by 
staff across the campus is laudable. 

Unfortunately, that is all the praise 
we have for this project. The adminis-
tration had the right idea; the campus 
Web site was in dire need of a rede-
sign. Issues ranging from navigation to 
user interface to a lack of features have 
plagued visitors. However, the process 
used to design the new site — particu-
larly the use of multiple committees to 
make technical decisions — was inher-
ently flawed, and this process and its 
results deserve critique. 

Some of us have worked on por-
tions of the new site. In doing so, we 
battled with Vignette, the content man-
agement system the university switched 
to some time ago. The goal was to 
create a flexible and easy mechanism 
to alter content on the site; ironically, 
this piece of software has been plagued 
with management and performance 
issues since it was chosen. With the 
state of TritonLink and Blink as they 
were before the redesign, or the drop in 
admissions to Sixth College as a result 
of switching off a dedicated site (three 
systems already running on Vignette), 
the university should reconsider use 
ing Vignette and choose a smart, open 
alternative. 

Furthermore, this new design — 
regardless of said visual appeal — does 
nothing to fix underlying issues with 
how the university manages its Web 
sites: TritonLink still goes down at the 
beginning of every quarter and needs 
to be “maintained” for seven hours 
each day. How can a core service be 
inaccessible for more than one out of 
every four hours and fall over when it’s 

most needed, but still be declared suc-
cessful and reliable? 

As a mix of current and former 
student technical staff employed by 
the university (some, the designers to 
whom you falsely attribute praise of 
the Web site), we respect the time and 
effort that have been put into the site, 
some of our own included. However, 
we think that this effort has done harm 
to the university. We call for a full 
discussion on whether this campus is 
achieving the world-class information-
technology initiatives it deserves.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JANUARY 17, 2008

attention of WCSC, but by that point, 
garnering the input of the student 
body was a lost cause. Regardless of 
what the students had to say, the CEP 
had already made its decision.  

According to Pham, when he 
mentioned the curriculum change 
to WCSC, many students expressed 
dissent to the proposed alterations. 
Furthermore, though a few of the stu-
dents had heard talk about changing 
requirements in the future, none of 
them had seen the specific language 
of the proposal or knew the extent of 
what the changes entailed.  

It is a shame that students were 
not consulted earlier in the process. 
Many undergraduates have very 
strong opinions about the current GE 
requirements’ strengths and weak-
nesses. For instance, when assess-
ing their experiences with their 
past courses, some members of the 
student council expressed negative 
opinions regarding the ethics and 
society and Warren Writing courses, 
explaining that the classes are not 
achieving their respective purposes. 
Some students said that modifying 
the courses would be a much more 

effective way of improving general 
education than forcing students to 
take more classes that may be falling 
short of their objectives.  

Other groups of students were not 
as pessimistic regarding the current 
requirements but did not see a need 
for change and 
sought further 
justification for 
the unsuspected 
proposal.  

No matter 
how varied the 
students’ opin-
ions were, the 
fact of the matter 
is that many stu-
dents had valu-
able information 
and experiences 
they hoped to 
contribute to 
the discussion, and in the end, their 
opinions will likely be slighted with-
out reason.  

There is a sliver of a chance that 
the change to Warren College’s cur-
riculum will not be passed. Because 
the decision to change curriculum 
requirements affects university 

bylaws, the proposal must still jump 
one final hurdle and be approved 
by the Academic Senate before it is 
finalized, but Pham and many of his 
colleagues do not feel that their argu-
ments against the changes will make 
any difference this late in the process. 

Warren faculty 
and the CEP have 
already supported 
the changes over-
whelmingly, and 
after years of con-
sideration, there is 
a very good chance 
that the proposal 
will be accepted.  

H o p e f u l l y 
UCSD will realize 
the error in snub-
bing students and 
amend this prob-
lem by giving them 

the attention that they deserve in 
future decision-making processes. 
The importance of student input in 
decisions that directly affect students 
is undeniable. 

Moreover, informing students 
about such decisions only after their 
input is inconsequential. WCSC and 

UCSD students in general play a cru-
cial role in shaping student life and 
providing valuable information about 
student opinions, which often help 
to improve campus life and move 
educational and social experiences 
forward.  

By neglecting to give students ade-
quate information and time to have 
their voices heard on issues directly 
affecting their peers, UCSD is per-
forming a great disservice. Though 
it may be too late in the process for 
students to do anything about this 
recent upset, UCSD should make an 
effort to keep students informed and 
give them opportunities to be heard. 
Refusing to do so does more than 
upset students, it can also hurt UCSD 
as a whole by causing it to miss out on 
a crucial perspective when making 
decisions. Besides, there are no better 
subjects capable of assessing student 
experience and education than the 
students themselves — and the best 
way to make sure their needs are met 
is to attend to them, not to ignore 
them.  

Readers can contact Marissa Blunschi 
at mblunsch@ucsd.edu.

“Among graduates, those with the 
lowest predicted earnings suffer 
significantly larger and much more 
persistent earnings losses than those 
at the top.” 

The point to take away is to head 
a course of academic diversification. 
Students majoring in subjects related 
to job sectors most susceptible to 
unemployment swings — such as eco-
nomics, urban studies and planning 
and potentially engineering —  should 
take courses in a curriculum that 
relates to a relatively stable job sector, 
like biology. Doing so will allow them 
the opportunity to explore fields not 
directly correlated with their particu-
lar area of study. 

Moreover, although UCSD’s six 
colleges have various general educa-
tion requirements, it would be more 
effective for students to branch off 
from those requirements and to pur-
sue traditionally in-demand courses 
such as biology, chemistry and physics. 
Undergraduates intending to broaden 
their horizons — and thus broad-
en their appeal to future employers 
— are increasingly cramming double 
majors and minors into their time 
spent at school. But even if students 
aren’t keen on deviating from their 
field of study, work experience related 
to their major helps better position 
students within their intended career 
path. Finally, electing to get involved 
on campus also attaches undergradu-
ates to a set of attractive characteris-
tics that may aid them in their search 
for that first, major job.

To understand where young work-
ers are headed within this slump, and 
what job sectors may be the most 
affected, it helps to review why unem-
ployment figures are influenced by 
the subprime credit crisis in the first 
place. It can be explained in three 
words: softening consumer spend-
ing.

Traditionally, analysts worry that 
rising mortgage delinquencies would 
force banks to hoard their cash 
reserves so that investors wouldn’t 
fret a bank run. As a result of the 
policy, banks would then tighten 
their lending standards so that even 
individuals with good credit rat-
ings would find it difficult to get 
loans to purchase economy-support-
ing big-ticket items like homes and 
other prohibitively expensive goods. 
And because consumer spending 
accounts for about 75 percent of 
total U.S. gross domestic product, 
any sort of significant waning in 
consumer spending would lead the 
economy to stagnation. If the econ-
omy stagnates, the employment rate 
will follow. 

The U.S. Department of Labor 
reported that some of the primary 
employment sectors directly affected 
by the housing crisis include the con-
struction, retail and financial services 
sectors. But unemployment rates are 
not expected to confine themselves 
strictly within these fields. Just recent-
ly, telecommunications giant AT&T 
reported a weakening consumer base, 
which prompted analysts to rethink 
just what type of job fields will be 
spared. 

Indeed, all three of the major 
U.S. stock market indices are trend-
ing lower. And because their health 
can be used as a tool to measure the 
overall well-being of the economy, the 
fact that the broad S&P 500’s five-day 
start in 2008 was the worst in history 
does not help the situation. Even the 
Nasdaq, an index composed mainly of 
technology stocks based in the United 
States and abroad, has not dodged the 
bludgeoning.

All of this information foreshad-
ows  a softening job market, sooner 
rather than later, so students need to 
start gearing up now by diversifying 
their range of study in order to look 
more appealing to employers.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 17, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  9

By Autumn Schuster
Senior Staff Writer

T he days of Kay Corleone are long gone, and Diane 
Keaton has settled into 
the archetypal crispy, 
upper crust matron role 
quite nicely. Though a bit 
aged, she can still play 
the role model WASP 
to the letter, throwing a 
sweater around her neck 
and wearing those pearls 
with creepy authentic-
ity. It’s with this manic 
panache that she ditches 
last year’s role as Mandy 
Moore’s mom (just one of 
2007’s January duds) for 
this year’s first pathetic 
attempt at girl power.

Essentially, when 
things go south for 
Keaton and her wimpy 
husband, Ted Danson 
(cast in the “what the 
hell?” role), she’s got to 
get back to work, teaming up with pals Queen Latifah 
and Katie Holmes to show us how real bank robbers 
do: scrubbing floors, mulching old green-backs and 
stealing from the Federal Reserve, all while looking 
fabulous. 

Yes, each diva may contribute to the scheme, but 
the true mastermind behind these fiscal hijinks is 
grand dame Keaton.

Can three people really steal from the Federal 
Reserve with uncanny winks and unabashed spending? 
Why not? The movie is a dream come true for anyone 
who wants to take a trip into the never never land of 
our capitalistic dreams. Callie Khouri, the brain behind 
the ultimate female fuck-you “Thelma and Louise,” 

d i r e c t e d 
“ M a d 
Money” with a similarly inspired, yet watered down 
version of the same message. 

What could have been another middle finger to 
society ends up being a polite shoulder tap greased up 
in comical guffaws. One liners and “oh no, she didn’ts” 
run amok as Queen Latifah delivers her signature sass 
and Holmes cutes her way through every scene. Told 
from the ever-clever vantage point of police inter-
views and tagged timelines, “Mad Money” gives us an 
un-inventive tale in an even less inventive manner.

Khouri wants to lure the audience in with the 
underlying desire all people have to stick it to the man 

for the commercial injustice 
done to them daily. The only 
problem with the lighthearted 
economic jabs is that they play 
more with bank robbing than 
social injustice. 

“Mad Money” is no 
“Trading Places” but rather a 
limp take on “Fun with Dick 
and Jane,” a harmless little flick 
about girls acting outrageous-
ly that wants to be masked as a 
story of little guys reaching for 
the American dream.

“Mad Money” is one of 
those films that, despite ignor-

Lupe Fiasco
■ The Cool
ATLANTIC

L upe Fiasco’s The Cool could alternately be titled Why Doesn’t Anyone Think Backpack Rappers 
Like Me Are Cool? Lupe is upset with 
the state of hip-hop, it seems. On his 
first single, “Dumb It Down,” he deals 
with imaginary haters begging him to 
dumb his music down. “You’re shed-
ding too much light, Lupe,” declares 
some anonymous white guy on the 
chorus’ second round. You might 
think Lupe’s rhymes can cure A.I.D.S. 
or end world hunger; instead, they 
read more like that one kid from 
your high school’s poetry slam. What 
Lupe forgot is that leaving out any 
reference to cocaine or bitches doesn’t 

necessarily make your rhymes smart. 
Some really intelligent people like 
cocaine and bitches, you know. Ever 
heard of Sigmund Freud?

Lupe is pretty entertaining when 
he isn’t preaching or waxing phil-
osophical, but these moments are 
few and far between. On “Hip-Hop 
Saved My Life” (it’s not just a corny 
t-shirt anymore) Lupe tells the story 
of a well-intentioned young man who 
ends up making run-of-the-mill rap 
just so he can support his family. As 
with any good storyteller, it’s all in 
the details: his first single is called 
“Stack that Cheese;” his first big break 
is when the radio plays his freestyle 

over crunk hit “Wipe Me Down.” 
Lupe is capable of making some great 
music when he manages to remove 
the massive chip from his shoulder, 
“Paris, Tokyo” being a fine example. 
Lupe’s reworking of Snoop’s classic 
“Ain’t No Fun” rhyme really says it all: 
“Guess who’s back in the house/ With 
a bunch of souvenirs and a smile 
for your mouth.”  These songs aren’t 
dumbed down; they’re not self-con-
scious and preachy, and that’s when 
Lupe gets it right. What I’m trying to 
say is this: shut the fuck up and we’ll 
listen to you.

Rivers Cuomo
■ Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo
GEFFEN

W ith many critics claiming Weezer’s 2005 release, Make Believe, was an all-time artistic 
low, front man Rivers Cuomo ditched 
his typical “bad album” game plan 
of isolated tantrums and extraneous 
educational pursuits, instead releas-
ing an album that brings the geeky 
alt-rock quartet’s fans back to the 
good ol’ days of de-threaded sweaters 
and sing-songy melodies.

Ranging from tracks recorded 
between 1992 and 2007, the 18-song 
compilation reveals rough drafts, con-
versation snippets and obscure cov-
ers, immersing listeners in Cuomo’s 
longtime influences and indulgent 

experiments. While 30-second cuts 
added for sentimental value (“I Wish 
You Had an Axe Guitar” features a 
pre-pubescent Cuomo professing his 
dedication to emulating K.I.S.S.) and 
eccentric supplemental liner notes 
are for longtime admirers, the major-
ity of Alone’s tracks hark back to 
the traditional Weezer concoction 
of gratifying melodies, honest lyrics, 
growling layers of distorted electric 
guitars and clanky cymbals among 
relentlessly simple drumbeats. 

However, rare tracks like Cuomo’s 
cover of Gregg Alexander’s “The 
World We Love So Much” expose 
strained and emoting vocals paired 

with persistent acoustic plucking that 
contradict Weezer’s typical sound, 
proving our square-rimmed buddy to 
be more than just a one-trick pony.

Although most of Alone’s love 
ballads balance the cheese factor 
with underlying tones of frustration 
and anger, recently recorded tracks 
like “This is the Way” approach boy-
band status with whispered nothings 
and empty lyrics (“I will never leave/ 
Because you’re the air I breathe”) con-
firming, sadly, that perhaps Cuomo’s 
outfit — due for a 2008 release — has 
passed its prime.

— Alyssa Bereznak
Senior Staff Writer

I t starts where disc one left off, as a chorus of Thom Yorkes chant over a looping piano flurry in 
short segway “MK 1.” More so than 
In Rainbows, the bonus disc presents 
itself as an odds-and-ends collec-
tion; “Up on the Ladder” has been 
in rotation since the Kid A days, 
five tracks serve as b-sides from the 
group’s latest sessions and the other 
two (“MK 1” and “2”) act as smooth, 
eerie transitions. 

“Down is the New Up” makes 
for Radiohead’s most overt poli-
tics-bashing track yet, satirizing 
flip-floppers and double-speak. 
Yorke does a pretty believable 
Prince impression toward its end, 
taking the falsetto to new heights. 
The chord progression and guitar 
lick in “Go Slowly” apes the old 
single “There There,” only drum-
less and breathy in the vein of Kid 
A’s “Motion Picture Soundtrack;” 
it’s not new territory for the Brits, 
rather evidence that their minor-key 
schemes haven’t failed them yet. 

Sparse piano/voice combo “Last 
Flowers” unfolds like a love ballad 

written for a dysfunctional couple. 
It’s wispy, tender and evokes pity, 
but a sense of deja vu lingers around 
the proceedings. 

And the uneventful “Up On the 
Ladder” throbs like a lazy drunk 
without a future, happy that he 
never got involved in corporate 
dealings (see angsty bathroom lyr-
ics: “Up on the ladder/ you’re all 
the fucking same”). But the stron-
gest track, “Bangers + Mash,” sees 
Radiohead attempt a rhythm-heavy 
funk jam built on abrasive guitar 
loops. The genesis of this song, from 
no-nonsense rock anthem to jittery 
dance mash-up, proves their creativ-
ity hasn’t faded with age.

As the few survivors leave their 
bomb shelters in a post-apocalyptic, 
post-Radiohead world, “4 Minute 
Warning” calmly begins its minimal 
tambourine procession. The bar-
crooners’ “oohs” grow in volume, 
providing a sense of closure to a cre-
ative force ready for another well-
deserved rest.

Ringo Starr
■ Liverpool 8
CAPITOL/EMI

I n his most recent melodic journey, Fab Four alum Ringo Starr winds a clumsy but charming web of ’70s 
Beatles nostalgia, perfectly fitting for 
a post-breakup breakout. The prob-
lem? It’s 2008 and this is the 14th 
album Starr has dropped since the 
boys parted ways.

Liverpool 8 twists through a thick 
maze of easy throwback clippings 
— every song a deja vu-inducing 
wonder — and unadorned lines. 
The disc’s first and autobiographi-
cal namesake track pulls us into the 
psyche of the friendly, joyful and 
slightly daft caricature Starr appar-
ently hasn’t broken from since 1965. 

With haltingly awkward rhymes 
— “In the U.S.A/ when we played 
Shea/ we were number one/ and it 
was fun” — triumphantly uncalled-
for string outbursts and even a pre-
recorded crowd cheer, it sets the tone 
for a needlessly dense and heavy-
footed compilation. And while half 
the tracks follow this cut-and-paste 
formula, piling every Beatles hall-
mark into a cluttered British Invasion 
collage, others hone in on a particular 
hit, achieving only sloppy replicas. 
“For Love” might as well be called “All 
You Need Is Love pt. 2” and “Harry’s 
Song” is a sorry stab at “When I’m 
64.” Starr only breaks form on his last 

track, “R U Ready,” a distant-voiced 
bluegrass ditty that finally gives a 
heartbreaking nod toward a man 
deeper than Billy Shears.

Unfortunately, it looks like light-
ning struck this Liverpool native only 
once. But forget the Beatles-set bar 
this muddy ’60s mishmash fails to 
meet, and you’re left admitting Starr’s 
rip off is sweetly thorough — acces-
sibly simple lyrics, danceable back-
beats and psychedelic interjections 
earn Liverpool 8 the knock-off crown 
and a spot on 2008’s background-
music playlist.

British Sea Power
■ Do You Like Rock Music?
ROUGH TRADE

T he strange query “Do You Like Rock Music?” is boldly carved on the cover sleeve of British Sea 
Power’s third album. The English 
foursome sailed into the world of 
indie-rock on their Black Pearl of 
a debut The Decline of British Sea 
Power, a hurricane-inducing album 
comparable to fuzzed-out greats 
Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody 
Valentine. In 2005, BSP’s anthem-
filled sophomore release — a cleaner 
and more subdued collection than 
its predecessor — was labeled by 
many as a product of commercial 
pressure. Now, three years later, the 
band returns with a question.

The nature-preservation scouts of 
BSP appear heroically out of coastal 
Brighton’s early-morning fog just as a 
marching beat amplifies in the open-
er “All in It,” and an arrangement of 
violins and organs suddenly flourish 
as the sun rises above the horizon 
where they stand. Such instrumenta-
tion creates an orchestral vibe simi-
lar to the Arcade Fire, which isn’t 
much of a surprise (ex-Arcade Fire 
drummer Howard Bilerman co-pro-
ducered the record). Bilerman leaves 
traces of his work on the “Haiti”-like 
“No Lucifer,” in which wrestler Big 
Daddy’s famous chant “Easy! Easy! 
Easy!” is masked by band mem-

ber/history buff Yan’s eerie vocals, 
“We can always just say no/ To the 
anti-aircraft crew/ The boys from 
the Hitler youth.” The band gets 
nostalgic on “Atom,” as energetic 
guitar riffs smash through the speak-
ers like fighter planes. Eight-minute 
showstopper “We Close Our Eyes” is 
a built-up reprise of the opener “All 
in It,” leaving the audience stranded, 
watching the ship sail away. BSP 
answers its title question with a 
resounding “yes,” convincing us that 
— although somewhat tried — they 
can still defy expectations.

12  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JANUARY 17, 2008

Youtube may be entertaining for 
a few minutes, but most people 
aren’t capable of staying logged on 
for long hauls, much less for a 90-
minute movie in a similar style. 
Without a good story or intriguing 
characters, all that “Cloverfield” has 
left to ride on are its special effects 
and action sequences, and the good 
ones are few and far between.

The first 15 minutes of 
“Cloverfield” are a going-away party 
experienced through the lens of an 
idiot trying to capture testimonials 
and hit on girls. The shit hits the 
fan when something — we never 
do find out what — crash lands in 
the city and starts hurling things, 
like the iconic head of the Statue of 
Liberty, around. 

From there we’re given an “inside 
the action” experience, which obvi-
ously means lots of shaking and 
blurred movement, doing as much 
for a queasy stomach as lemon juice 
would for a paper cut. 

From fumbling with the lens 
and shooting his feet as he walks, to 
dropping the camera all together as 
it rolls down the stairs, most of the 
content is unwatchable while the 
rest is simply nauseating. 

The only respite from the end-
less shaking is when our camera-
man is knocked unconscious for 
a moment, or puts the camera 
down long enough to twist a piece 
of shrapnel from his best friend’s 
shoulder. For explosions and chase 
scenes, the method of rattling the 
audience senseless works well, but 
thankfully those are generally small 
doses. 

Any more and it’s just a way of 
skimping on choreography. If orga-
nizing a chase scene is too much 
for the cinematographer to bother 
himself with, then he may turn to 
driving in circles and shaking the 
camera as much as he can, hoping 
to create the illusion of action, i.e. 
“The Bourne Supremacy.” 

But it’s a cheap parlor trick that 
won’t fool savvy audiences; direc-
tors must be getting lazy — and 
naive — if they think this kind of 
gimmickry will hold up for long.

ing the obvious implausibility of the 
entire movie, never lags. It’s gim-
micky fluff that’s passively enter-
taining, the kind that leaves the 
back of your mind free to formu-
late grocery lists or remember your 
mom’s birthday next week, exorcis-
ing the film from your mind as the 
lights go up. 

More likely than not, it was 
conceived as a solid paycheck for 
actresses who might find roles hard 
to come by (Holmes’ last film was 
in 2005, ya’ll). At its most heartfelt 
moment, the movie’s bent on rak-
ing in as much cash as possible by 
giving you big names and larger-
than-life antics — if you want clas-
sic, you’ve got Diane Keaton; if you 
want strong independent woman, 
there’s Queen Latifah and, hell, 
if you want a little modern-day 
Audrey Hepburn (at least according 
to Keaton), you’ve got Holmes.

But if you’re going to create 
some silliness about dubious chicks 
robbing the Federal Reserve, you 
might as well up the ante and have 
the Spice Girls as the leads. 

At least they can sing, steal, and 
make you half believe in their man-
ufactured authenticity.

The San Diego Chargers have a 
running game that can successfully 
keep the vaunted Patriots offense 
off the field for a long time, no mat-
ter who’s running, while also wear-

the other side of the ball, San Diego 
has a defense, or more precisely a 
few specific defensive players who 
should have no problem doing what 
so many players have shied away 
from all season long: knock Tom 
Brady down. Hard. 

Sure, Shawne Merriman is a Pro 
Bowler with a fun nickname and an 
awkward sack dance, but if he gives 
Brady the ol’ Ike Turner Special, 
Merriman goes from San Diego

will bake him pies, Eric Mangini 
might knit him a sweater and I’m 
pretty sure Bridget Moynahan 
would have his babies and not ask 
for alimony.

still the head coach in San Diego, 
and all those people who praised 
him after the Colts win would have 
been calling for him to be fired had 
the Chargers lost, just as manage-
ment threw Marty Schottenheimer 
under the bus when it was his 
players’ bonehead decisions, not 
Martyball, that cost the Chargers 
the win against the Patriots in the 
playoffs last year. Well, LT and the 
rest of the team have a chance to 
payback the Pats for their classless 
actions at the end of that game, but 
it will take a lot of heroes to make 
that happen.

Unless Junior Seau pulls the old 
switcheroo and rips off his Patriots 
jersey to reveal Chargers colors it’s 
going to be a long afternoon. Hope 
for the best, San Diego, but prepare 
for the worst.
Prediction: Patriots 27, Chargers 16

rival Cardinal. 
While they were unable to topple 

their Northern Californian oppo-
nents, the Triton men were able 
to squeak out a very impressive 
14-13 win against Air Force, along 
with a 22-5 win over Florida. The 
foil squad led the Tritons in their 
Sunday matches, with seniors John 
Chung and Cameron Sprowles and 
freshman Benjamin Dorn all going 
9-3 on the day. 

Sophomore Sean Blum from epee 
was especially happy with knocking 
off the very impressive host team of 
Air Force.

“The Air Force squad, their epee 
especially, was really strong and 
had some of the top players in the 
nation,” Blum said. “So that made it 
really tough for our guys — but all 

the better when we won our match 
against them.”

Although the teams did not per-
form as well as they had in their 
preseason meets, the chance to 
improve their play by competing 
against more skilled competition 
was invaluable. 

“Some of these fencers are not 
only the top fencers in the NCAA 
but some of the top fencers in the 
nation,” Schnecker said. “For some 
teammates, it was difficult to stand 
a chance against such more expe-
rienced fencers, but in these cases, 
it was exciting even to get just one 
touch. For some of the more expe-
rienced fencers on the team, it was 
exciting because they actually did 
well against these amazing ath-
letes.”

The Tritons showed their true 

grit and determination by not being 
intimidated by the Division I sta-
tus of their opponents, but instead 
striving to prove so that they could 
fence with any team in the nation 
regardless of division.

“The team was fairly disap-
pointed with our overall results, 
especially against Stanford,” Lipoma 
said. “Although we had some good 
individual and squad victories, we 
would have liked to have done much 
better. In the past few seasons we’ve 
built up a rivalry with Stanford, and 
we’re looking forward to coming up 
against them again.”

Next up for UCSD will be the 
North America Cup held in Atlanta, 
Ga. from Jan. 18-21.

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, JANUARY 17, 2008

CLUB SPORTS — UCSD’s badminton 
team returned to action on Jan. 11 
in an exhibition match against UC 
Berkeley at Main Gym. The “friend-
ly” served as a much-needed tuneup 
for the team’s crucial league matchup 
with UCLA next weekend. Following 
a two-month break, the Tritons used 
the exhibition to get back into their 
groove.

“UCLA has always been one of our 
toughest opponents,” junior co-cap-
tain Anthony Duong said. “It’s impor-
tant to get some matches in before 
facing a league rival, especially a team 
as strong as UCLA.”

The badminton program at UCSD 
has thrived over recent years, becom-
ing one of the nation’s largest, with 
close to 50 players and marked enthu-
siasm from everyone involved. Each 
member has had plenty to root for; the 
Triton badminton team has finished 
its season as national champions three 
out of the last five years. In 2007, the 
team placed third at nationals, which 
was hosted at UC Berkeley. 

According to senior co-captain 
John Chen, with several contributing 
freshmen joining the team, UCSD 
is optimistic it can return to the top 
once again this year. The youthful 

experience, however, will take time 
to flourish.

“Every new player has something 
unique to offer our team, but it 
takes time to cultivate their talents 
into our lineup” Chen said. “The 
hardest part for us is finding a way 
to integrate each player’s talent into 
the lineup.

Many of UCSD’s competitors have 
enough quality players to field only 
one ‘A’ team, but the Tritons receive 
so many interested players that they 
are capable of filling as many as four 
full lineups. Because of this, it has 
been tough for UCSD to get all of its 
members to play, but that doesn’t stop 
the supporting cast from rooting pas-
sionately on the sidelines.

That was definitely the case against 
UC Berkeley, as Duong and fellow 
co-captains senior Carol Chau and 
Chen had to pick their top 12 in a 
revised format against the Golden 
Bears. Normally, badminton match-
es are played with five events: men’s 
singles and doubles, women’s singles 
and doubles and mixed doubles. Each 
event has three games for a total of 15 
points that are stake for the match’s 
overall score.

For this exhibition, UC Berkeley 
and UCSD elected to play only two 
games in the three doubles events, 
using a total of only 12 points. The 
Golden Bears managed to defeat 
UCSD, but the Tritons used their 
entire lineup in the matches, while 
the Bears recycled players by using 
them in multiple events, which is not 
allowed in league play.

Chen said the exhibition against 
the Bears proved invaluable for the 

younger Tritons.
“This opportunity gave some of 

our most inexperienced players a 
chance to play in a competitive setting 
against quality opposition,” he said.

The Jan. 19 match against UCLA 
is the first of several league matches 
that will take place over the next two 
months for the Tritons. UCSD took 
part in league matches earlier in the 
season, but with upcoming matches 
against defending champions UC 

Irvine and UC Riverside, there is still 
plenty left on the schedule. 

According to Chen, UCLA’s fresh-
men add to an already strong squad, 
but the Tritons are determined confi-
dent they can succeed.

“[UCLA’s freshmen] have made a 
great team even better, and it will be 
a challenge that our team is looking 
forward to,” Chen said. “It will be cru-
cial for our team to be mentally strong 
because I believe we have enough tal-

ent to upset them.”
This year, nationals will be held in 

Maryland, and with enough fundrais-
ing, UCSD is expected to make the 
trip for a tournament that is open to 
every badminton program across the 
nation. With one of the nation’s most 
successful programs, the Tritons hope 
to continue their winning ways.

He entered the game to laughs and hisses, fans of his team already predict-
ing his misses. The game was close, 
he resembled not a savior; going 
three and out almost seemed like a 
favor. And then things turned, and 
confidence rose, as he made not just 
the handoffs, but also the throws. 
A pre-destined win for the home 
team, until somebody stole it, for 
with a one-yard dive, was born the 
legend of Billy Volek.

Sighs were heard throughout 
the constantly expanding Charger 
Nation when San Diego backup 
quarterback Billy Volek made his 
way onto the field during the pivot-
al fourth quarter against the heavily 
favored Indianapolis Colts. 

There were a select few (me) 
who rose above the popular dissen-
sion and cheered the Hemet-born, 
Fresno State-educated quarterback’s 
arrival, and like Volek, they too 
were redeemed on each of his suc-
cessful pass attempts and his game-
winning touchdown plunge (yay, 
me!).

However, even the most stri-
dent of Volek fans would be fool-
ing themselves if they think he 
should be starting in the AFC 
Championship game against the 
New England Patriots. No mat-
ter what Volek or backup running 
backs Michael Turner and Darren 
Sproles accomplished in the RCA 
Dome, the Chargers need both their 
MVP LaDainian Tomlinson and 

their brash starting quarterback, 
Philip “The Balls” Rivers (a nick-
name he truly needs and deserves), 
to compete with the juggernaut that 
is the New England Patriots.

The Pats have made it to 17-0 
by playing the kind of football you 
might have seen on Madden ’05 
Pro Level, where you could basi-
cally throw underneath routes all 
day, do same crazy blitzes from 
off-screen and cruise to dominat-
ing wins. Sure, an occasional game 
would end up being close, but there 
was no doubt that you’d be able to 
throw a few passes to your running 
backs, find the TE coming across 
the middle and score when needed. 

They’re good, they’re great and 
they’re another successful team 
from a Northeastern city that has 
become increasingly annoying. 
ESPN spent a week stacking the 
Patriots up against every great team 
in NFL history, not paying much 
attention to how easy it is to stack 
up big passing games with today’s 
rules, and basically anointing them 
champions before the first playoff 
game.

The most appropriate anal-
ogy for the New England Patriots 
is this: they’ve become those “ques-
tion kids” who inhabit so many 
classes. They take up so much time, 
they’re always there and they annoy 
the hell out of everyone except the 
select few who share their over-
achieving background or just don’t 
know any better. 

This is the reason we will be 
looking at bandwagon Patriots 
fans for the next decade. It’s not 
that these people really like New 
England — they just started paying 
attention this season and thought 
an undefeated team with a scruffy

FENCING — This year’s first seri-
ous road trip to the NCAA West 
Invitational in Colorado Springs, 
Colo. over the weekend gave the 
Tritons a chance to face off against 

some of the nation’s top fencers 
while competing in a new envi-
ronment. The team split its total 
matches for the meet, with both 
the men’s and women’s teams going 
2-2. The meet, which pitted UCSD 
against Stanford University, the 
University of Florida, the University 

of Notre Dame and the host Air 
Force Academy, was the Tritons’ 
first NCAA competition of the year 
after four preseason meets.

While their fellow students were 
basking in the warm San Diego sun, 
the Triton fencers flew to Colorado, 
where they were met with snow 
flurries and the prospect of fencing 
at a very high elevation. 

The weather didn’t faze the 
Tritons, who were instead surprised 
by the climate during the meet 
itself.

Emily Lipoma, a senior on the 
women’s foil squad, thought the 
Colorado conditions were much 
more manageable than previous trips 
to the NCAA West Invitational.

“The climate and altitude actual-
ly took a lesser toll on the team than 
the last time we competed at Air 
Force in 2006,” Lipoma said. “The 
altitude effects were fairly negligible 
and the gym we fenced in was actu-
ally much warmer than it should 
have been.”

The meet’s format saw only the 
women fencing on Jan. 12, which 
gave the men’s team members a 
chance to rest up from the long 
plane ride while cheering on their 
female teammates. 

The women showed little respect 
to their hosts and beat the Air Force 
team 18-9. The Triton women got 
their only other win versus Florida, 
dominating the match to the tune 
of a 20-7 victory. Senior Chelsea 
Ambort paved the way for her epee 
squad, posting a 9-3 mark on the 
day. However, UCSD lost to Notre 
Dame 21-6 and, in what would set 
the tone for a dramatic showdown 
on the men’s side, lost to Stanford 
15-12. 

The men were unable to avenge 
the women’s Stanford loss, dropping 
a heartbreaking 15-14 match to the
