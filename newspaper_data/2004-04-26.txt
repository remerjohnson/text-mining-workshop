Warren students to vote on $4 fee 
Per-quarter fee would bolster activities 
., VLADlMII KOGAN 

Senior Staff Miter 
Members of the Warren 

College Student Council have 
asked students to vote on a four-
dollar-per-quarter activity fee ref-
erendum between April 26 and 
April 30 that would more than 
triple the amount of money avail-
able to the council. If the referen-
dum passes, Earl Warren College 
would become the fifth college to 
enact a student fee. 

"Warren is really suffering," said 
sophomore Brandon Blades, a spe-
cial assistant to the WCSC parlia-
mentarian and in charge of manag-
ing the referendum. "We need 
money so that people who have 
ideas have resources to implement 
them." 

The college council's budget, 
which is tied with Sinh College as 
the lowest on campus even though 
Warren has almost seven times more 
students, would suffer deep program 
cuts in the &11 of 2004 as a result of 
the university's funding shortages, 
according to WCSC President lim 
Alexander. Currently, Warren col-
lege and SiJth College are the only 
two colleges whose budgets do not 
include an activity fee. 

"There are going to be budget 
cuts aU over the place at Warren 
nen year," Alexander said. 

According to Alexander, in past 
years, Warren college's office of 
the provost supplemented the 
council 's Associated Students allo-
cation with proceeds from vending 
machine operations, though cuts in 
student affairs will cause the office 

Alpert call~ for higher

Senior Staff Writer 
State Sen. Dede Alpert (D-San 

Diego) called Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's proposed bud-
get a "broken promise" and told a 
group of approximately 20 stu-
dents that California needed high-
er income taxes for the wealthy to 
keep coUege affordable. 

Speaking at an AS.-sponsored 
forum about the future of higher 
education on April 23 at the 
Institute of the Americas, Alpert 
said legislaton could not risk a 
further trimming of already-mea-
ger funding for public universities 
and coUeges. 

"I think we've reached a point 
with the cuts that we've made last 
year, the cuts this year and the 
increases in tuition where, this 
year, we could potentially deny 
access and we could actually hurt 
quality," she said. "We've got to 
gather up support for people to say 
that there are thinp 10 important 
that they're willing to pay more 
money to make them happen.·

A.S. Council calls for 
lower stipends next year 
Total amount of A.S. stipends 

would decrease by $1 7,600 
By NEIL SPEAIIS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The AS. Council approved a 
set of stipend recommendations 
for the 2004-0S year that would 
reduce the total amount paid to 
councilmembers by more than 
SI7,600. The recommendations 
were approved during the coun-
cil's April 21 meeting. 

AS. Vice President Internal 
and President-elect Jeon Pae said 
she will take the recommenda-
tions into account when preparing 
nen year's executive budget. 

"I'm going to take some of 
those numbers, obviously because 
this year's council put a lot of 
thought into it, and a lot of dis-
cussion," Pae said. "It's a recom-
mendation, so it's something that 
I'm taking into consideration. " 

The decrease in stipends is due 
to a drop in expected interest from 
AS. accounts, which collects in a 
short-tenn interest program, or 
S.Tl.P. 

"'We're projecting that we'll 
have about S4S,OOO to work with 

in S.T.I.P.," Vice President 
Finance Eric Webster said. "We 
just couldn't afford to pay the 
$61,OOO-worth of stipends, so a 
lot of positio~ had to get cut. " 

Under the recommendations, 
executive and commiSSIOner 
stipends would be reduced 10 per-
cent, senaton would receive 40 
percent less, and each office would 
retain only one assistant, with the 
exception of the A.S. 
Programming Office, which is 
aUocated three assistants. Council 
stipends would total 542,990. 

A major point of debate 
regarding the recommendations 
revolved around senator stipends. 

"Directly or indirecdy, stu-
dents are paying for the senator 
stipends," Thurgood Manhall 
College freshman senator Alan 
Haimowitz said. "I know students 
care a lot about where their 
money goes, and I'm sure paying 
their senaton may not be their 
number-one priority."

Student 
Center 
designs 
revised 
By CHllmNE ME 

Senior Staff Writer 
In response to requests for a 

revised design, architects from the 
finn Public presented new 
schematic designs for Student 
Center expansion at the Building 
Advisory Committee meeting on 
April 23 . 

The "scheme n~ design of 
Student Center was presented at 
previous BAC meetings, but public 
input prompted architects to con-
sider and present three additional 
schemes. 

At a town hall meeting held on 
April 6, students suggested the 
preservation of Student Center's 
unique "village" feel to contrast the 
more open and less "private" Price 
Center. 

"The main thing was there was 
a feeling among the students that 
they wanted something that would 
respect the history of the center," 
said Jim Brown, an architect with 
Public. 

Scheme n featured two open 
courtyards, but with a large, open 
space that would extend toward the 
grassy "Hump." This plan suggest-
ed a more open space in Student 
Center and would eliminate its dark 
and cluttered aesthetics, Brown said. 

Of the three new schemes pre-
sented, the majority of the BAC 
expressed int~rest in scheme B, 
which features two separate court-
yards, a student lounge located in 
the middle of Student Center, and 
the relocation and reconstruction

TPC examines potential 
bike lane along Gilman 

The Transportation and Parking Committee 
decided to look into constructing a bike lane 
along Gilman Drive from Scholars Drive to Russell 
Lane after discussion at its April 8 meeting. 

The TPC, however, will not make a sohd deci-
sion about this until it determines how many 
people use that path at its next meeting in May, 
according to TPC faculty chair Daniel Arovas. He 
added that the TPC also wants to see a map of 
how this section of campus is OJrrentiy config-
ured and a sketch of how the road will look with 
the bike lanes added. The proposal requires that 
the vehicle lanes be narrowed to 11 feet and 
that 3 feet be taken off the median in order to 
make each bike lane 5 feet wide. 

The committee also decided that nonfacul-
ty members at the Hillcrest Medical Center who 
have of( parking permits will not be able to 
renew their "A" permits next year because fac-
ulty members are having a difficult time finding 
parking. Arovas said. However, this will not

parking permits on the main campus. 

The TPC announced that there will also be 
a pilot Coaster connection that will run from 
May 3 to December. This additional service will

himself to be open to new ideas," Alpert 
said. "I thinlc. he is just starting to learn the 
impacts of some of his choices, and I thinlc 
he is open to changing his mind." 

Alpert also portrayed funding for higher 
education as a benefit for the states budget 
deficits and a way [0 attract new commerce . 

"The most business-friendly [thing) you 
could do is provide more money for educa-
tion," she said. "The different UC campuses 
have really become centers for economic 
development, as well as places for students 
to learn, so it's actually a smart way for pe0-
ple to invest money. It's a benefit for the 
state in terms of to: revenue, and it's a ben-
efit for the people of California." 

Saying that the passage of voter initia-
tives limiting property taxes and OWldating 
funding levels for primary and secondary 
education had tied the hands of I, .. ators. 

Alpert proposed creating two new upper-
income tax brackets as an alternative to edu-
cational-sPending cuts. 

"When [ talk to people with those lcind of 
incomes, most of them say to me, 'I would 
gladly do that,''' Alpert said. "They won't do 
t1ut for everything, but to fund higher edu-
cation, 1 thinlc. they are absolutely willing to 
pay more money because they recognize 
how important it is."

University seeks changes to 
lease agreement with Co-ops 

ByUSAMAK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Master Space Agreement, 
the contractual document that 
leases the university co-op spaces 
to Associated Students and the 
Graduate Student Association, 
will most likely not be renewed in 
its current form before the April 
29 expiration deadline, according 
to representatives from the co-op 
oversight committee and 
University Centers. University 
Centers has stated that it will not 
sign the renewal until certain pro-
posed changes have been consid-
ered and amended in the docu-
ment. 

While the Master Space 
Agreement governs the lease rela-
tionship between University 
Centers, Associated Students and 
the Graduate Student Association, 
a Memorandum of Understanding 
in turn subleases spaces to the four 
co-ops on campus - the Food 
Co-op, Groundwork Books, the 
General Store Co-op and the Ch~ 
Cafe. Originally . drafted nine 
years ago with a five-year term, 
the Master Space Agreement has 
been renewed twice for two-year 
terms. 

Gary Ratcliff, director of 
University Centers, presented sub-
stantive changes in the teXt of the 
Master Space Agreement in buIIet-
point format at the April 9 co-op 
oversight corrunittee meeting. At 
the April 23 conunittee meeting, 
Ratcliff distributed a preliminary 
draft of the amendments, stating 
that University Centers will not 
renew the Master Space Agreement 
without the amendments. 

The proposed amendments to 
the Master Space Agreement are 

mostly procedural changes. One 
such change proposes to extend 
renewal periods from two to three 
years. Other changes clarify lan-
guage relating to alterations and 
repairs, payments and trade fix-
tures. 

"The approach we're using [for 
the changes) is surgical," Ratcliff 
said. "We're not tearing the docu-
ment apart, but repairing the parts 
that need work." 

"It is my opinion that all par-
ties to the MSA should renew the 
document for one or two years, 
and then enter into negotiations 
about amendments to the Master 
Space Agreement," Carol Freire, 
former co-op oversight commit-
tee chair, said. "The University 
Centers, however, is afraid t1ut if 
this is done, the parties will not 
pay attention to any proposed 
changes. llUs is a move on their 
part to bring others to the bar-
gaining table." 

At an April 21 council meeting, 
the A.S. Council approved the 
renewal of the current Master 
Space Agreement. 

"I think the method A.S. used 
to pass the pro~ was a bit awk-
ward," Ratcliff said. "There are 
three parties to the [Master Space 
Agreement] - A.S., the GSA and 
University Centers, and so A.S. 
cannot unilaterally pass an agree-
ment." 

According to the current 
Master Space Agreement, without 
a renewal upon expiration, the co-
ops will be leased on a month-to-
month basis. Several members of 
the oversight committee have 
expressed concern. over a month-
to-month lease. 

"We're dealing with businesses 
here - we often forget that," said 

Kate Pillon, the newly elected co-
op oversight committee chair. "I 
feel like it's unfair and not very 
good business practice for a busi-
ness to be running on a month-to-
month lease." 

Genenlly, members of the 
oversight committee are in favor 
of the proposed changes. 

"I think that overall the 
changes are really good and really 
helpful," Pillon said. "I thinlc that 
what all of us want is for the c0-
ops to exist. 1 thinlc that we all 
agree that they serve a hugely 
valuable purpose on this campus, 
but what we want is that they run 
safe and sound businesses, and 
that's something these changes are 
hoping to ensure." 

However, members of the 
committee also criticized 
University Centers for proposing 
the amendments at such a late 
date, leaving them little time to 
consider the changes before the 
expiration of the current Master 
Space Agreement. 

"I feel like the changes did 
come very late, and I thinlc. that 
this all could've been avoided had 
they come earlier," Pillon said. "I 
thinlc. that the main thing that 
people have a problem with is not 
the changes themselves . .. but 
that they came to us last-minute." 

Dana Dahlstrom, GSA-
appointed voting member on the 
co-op oversight committee, feels 
that University Centers should 
not refuse to renew the Master 
Space Agreement at this time. 

"We could amend (the Master 
Space Agreement] consensually 
at any time," Dahlstrom said. "I 
think it'd be a good show of faith

ERe records 46 percent 
of plagiarism cases 

Use of Turnitin.com responsible 
for volume of cases 

By BIYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
recorded the highest number of 
academic dishonesty cases among 
the colleges in the 2002-03 academ-
ic year, A.S. Commissioner of 
Student Advocacy Jeff Boyd report-
ed on April 21. According to Boyd, 
the high number of cases resulted 
from the use of online plagiarism 
prevention service Turnitin.com 
and a zero-tolerance policy in its 
required Making of the Modem 
World classes. ERC accounted for 
97 of the 210 cases handled at 
UCSD last year, representing 46 
percent of the total. No other col-
lege recorded more than 42 cases. 

"The problem is that ERC has a 
zero tolerance policy for cheating," 
Boyd said. "So 1 think there were a 
lot of cases t1ut were prosecuted 
unfairly. There are mistakes that 
happen at Turnitin.com and the 
MMW policy needs to reflect that." 

According to Boyd, the typical 
result of an academic dishonesty 
case is academic probation until 
graduation, an ethics workshop, an 
F on the paper and possibly an F in 
the course. 

Turnitin.com works by compar-
ing a student; work with a database 
of previously submitted student 
work and by searching the Web for 
strings of words contained in a 
paper. In classes that use the ser-
vice, all students are required to 
submit their work to the Web site 
for evaluation. Instructors are then 
notified if any of the words or sen-

tences in the assignment match 
another student's writing or a pub-
lished work. 

Boyd was also concerned about 
intellectual property rights issues, 
claiming t1ut students who use the

The feminist movement's dual-edged sword 
Feminist ideals are still relevant and necessary 

By ISlA YAGHOUBI 
Staff Writer 

When stand-up comedian Stu 
Silverstein recently encountered a feminist 
in a club in San Francisco, she requested 
not to be called a woman or a female 
because those titles have "man" and 
"male" in them. 

"What should I call you?" Stu asked. 
"I'rU a gyno-Americ3n," she replied. 
"Then what does that make me?" he 

said. 
"You' re a testosterone-poison-

humanoid," she said. 
The encounter underlines 3 taste of the 

resentment towart! men that is sometimes 
attributed to some feminists . 
Most feminists, however, are 

the type of violence and the amount of fear 
and injury experienced by each party. A 
September 2002 Amtrican Journal of Public 
Htalth article reports that women who are 
victims of domestic violence are much 
more likely to be injured - and injured 
severely - than are men, and that women 
experience higher levels of fear than men . 
in such situations. These issues need to be 
explored on college campuses, especially 
considering that women in the. age brack-
et of L6 to 24 are most likely to be victim-
ized by an intimate partner, according to a 
2002 report by the U.S. Department of 
Justice. 

Even with domestic violence aside, 
what about rape? While men and boys are 

also victims of sexual assault, 
the majority of sexual assault 

not vengeful commandos 
seething with misandry. 
Perhaps it becomes easier to 
understand how anger devel -
ops when one considers the 
glass ceiling and wage dispari -

PRO victims, hands down, are female . Women are nearly seven times more likely to be victimized than men are, 
according to the Justice 

ties between men and women, 
or the striking amount of sex-
ual assault, harassment and violence com-
mitted against women. 

There has been recent criticism of the 
feminist groups at UCSD for the supposed 
goal of masking domestic violence against 
men, specifically with respect to the April 
15 event "Take Back the Night," a collec-
tion of readings and speeches highlighting 
rape, violence and sexual assault against 
women. 

While domestic violence against men 
needs to be recognized and decried, criti-
cizing UCSD organizations like the 
Feminist Majority Leadership Alliance and 
the A.S. Women's Commission for focus-
ing on violence committed against women 
is ridiculous. These are women's groups 
and their primary focus is on womens' 
issues. Would anyone expect the College 
Republicans to promote the events of the 
College Democrats? This is not to imply 
that the interests of men and women are 
diametrically opposed (nor those of 
Democrats and Republicans) . Violence 
against women is specifically highljghted 
because the implications are greater. 

There is a myth of "mutuality" based 
on studies that report that men and women 
use physical violence at equal rates in inti-
mate relationships. This fails to consider 

Department report. The same 
study also reported a dramatic 
increase in the willingness to 

report rape and significant decline in over-
all sexual assault and rapes since 1993. 

Perhaps such a decline can be credited 
to events such as "Take Back the Night," 
which raise awareness about sexual assault, 
violence against women, and the need for 
gender equality. Raising awareness may 
seem unnecessary to many - everyone 
"\mows" about the issues. It should not be 
assumed that everyone knows the issues. 

The feminist movement is relatively 
fresh, historically speaking. Some women 
from the generation that fought for 
women's suffrage are still alive. Even at 
UCSD, .the FMLA has only been around 
since 2001. "Take Back the Night" is also 
only three years old, but has established a 
forum where these issues can be discussed 
and where creative response and experi-
ences are shared. To ignore the male end 
of gender issues is not right, but a strictly 
feminist perspective is better than no per-
spectives at all, considering that the per-
spectives of women were irrelevant or at 
best on the backburner for a long time. 
The more viewpoints and issues brought 
to the table, the better.

Movement marred by ridiculous semantics 
By KELLY GILBEII' 

Staff Writer 

Think back a minute: Remember the 
scene from "Legally Blonde" in which the 
stereotypical, lesbian-feminist-left-wing-lib-
eral character lectures some poor guy about 
Harvard's sexist language? The word "semes-
ters," she claims, obviously has a misogynistic 
root. To measure time in "ovesters," substi-
ruting an allusion to ovaries, rather than 
semen, would equalize things. 

Sound ridiculous? Maybe not. All of 
Hollywood's jokes aside, that's pretty much 
what the feminist movement at UCSD has 
started doing. 

At "Take Back the Night," volunteer 
attorney and UCSD political sci-
ence lecturer M. E. Stephens 

crew, though, that's guilty of perpetuating the 
fallacy of sameness. Far-left, extremist 
protesting and campaigning is rarely, if ever, 
an intelligent or logical approach to eliminat-
ing discrimination. More often than not, it'll 
just get reversed. 

Take, for example, pan of Muir 40~ read-
er, the "Guideline to nonsexist language" - a 
crucial component of the basic writing class 
required for all John Muir College students. 
The guidelines contend that it is incorrect 
and imprecise to use the words "man" and 
"freshmen" due to the blatant sexism present 
in both words. The correct terminology, 
thus, would be "homo sapiens" and "first-
year students." To say "man-made" makes 
you a chauvinist pig; the proper wording is 

"created by homo sapiens." If 
you're talking to a Muir 40 stu-

infonned the audience, "I do 1I0t 
consent to the quarter that some-
one fucking stole from me," 
referring to a statistic that 
women eam 75 cents for each 
dollar that men do. Stephens 

(ON dent, don't even get him (sorry - him or her) started on the ramifications of "humankind." The rationale behind this 
mutilation of grammar is that we 
believe what we say. Thus, if a 
writer refers to humanity in gen-
eral as "man," the inference a 

added, "It's not acceptable to me 
that there has never been a 
worrum governor in the state of California." 

Some people find it unacceptable that 
California has never had a female governor. 
But wouldn't that be putting a token person 
in a role, just like Hollywood does? If there 
were laws prohibiting a female governor, 
maybe things would be different. Is it unac-
ceptable that there has never been an LS-
year-old governor? A governor from every 
ethnic group' Installing a woman governor 
j~t to have one would reduce politics to the 
level of "Legally Blonde." 

And what of women earning a quarter less 
than men? Women can get a job, not impact 
their career by going on maternity leave (is it 
"lillacceptable" that men can't have babies?), 
and then see if their careers are stiD molded 
by that statistic. Think Marye Anne Fox, who 
earns almost $60,000 more than the average 
UC ChanceDor, would be getting a higher 
salary if she had a Y chromosome? Probably 
not. 

There's a huge difference between equali-
ty and -.rI, and quite a few feminists miss 
it all too often. Obviously men and women 
are never going to be the same - otbenriJe, 
whether or not we hav.: a female panor 
wouldn't be an issue. But that doesn't mean 
they can't be equal, no matter what feminist 
rallies try to tell you. 

It isn't just the "rake Ba the Night" 

reader will make is that the writer does not 
actually mean people; he actually means 
human males above the age of LS. By using 
so-called sexist language, so the story goes, 
we subconsciously bias ourselves against the 
female species (and, for that matter, males 
who haven't yet reached adulthood). 

It's an interesting argument, but quite a 
stretch. If this concept held true, you'd think 
that in a country like Spain, where the nation-
al language allows for a genderless singular 
pronoun (the difference between "him" and 
"her" is not distinguished in the Spanish lan-
guage; as a general rule, verbs don't even 
require subjects, let alone male or female sub-
jects), the rates of female employment would 
be higher since the population would not be 
biased by their sexist language. But a 2002 
study by statisticians Juan Dolado and 
Borentino Fe1gueroso documented that the 
unemployment rate of women in Spain is sig-
nificandy higher than that of the United 
States. 

Furthermore, by trying to create some 
sort of female role in our daily grammar, all 
we're really doing is shifting some sort of 
imapwy discrimination against women to a 
more real discrimination against 1Ilen. When

Race-baiting thrives on university campuses 
Milwaukee election indicative of nationwide problem 
returned 

yank 
Chris Taylor 

One proverb that universities teach us very effectively is 
that "if at first you don't 

succeed, just cry racism." It's a 
surefire solution to all failures. 
Students First! iast year used this 
slogan very effectively. Everyone 
who has tried to cut funding to 
Tht KHItI shouts it. Ethnic studies 
courses attribute nearly all failure 
of cultures to white hegemonic 
racism. 

This author only wishes that 
this sort of childishness would 
halt at the university level. 
College students are hopeless 
because we learn to think so far 
outside common sense. 

But it goes that there might be 
hope for the real world. Clearly, 
this author has his hopes set too 
high. For example, the recent 
mayoral election in Milwaukee, 
which shows the worst of college 
thinking seeping into the real 
world. 

"Racism is alive and well in 
Milwaukee. It's alive and well and 
thriving," insisted Dianne Pratt, 
~;fe of defeated Mil~aukee may-
oral candidate Marvin Pratt. Mrs . 
Pratt's reason for assurance of 
"thriving" racism? Her husband 
lost. 

Two weeks prior, very left-
leaning Democratic candidate 
Tom Barrett, who is white, defeat-

ed Marvin Pratt, another 
Democrat, who is black. The city 
is in upheaval over the results 
because of the perception that the 
resul t was racist. 

The reason Mrs. Pratt says she 
is justified in playing the race card 
is because her husband was initial-
ly ahead in the polls. According to 
her, racists used negative cam-
paigning against her husband 
because he's black. This turned 
the tide of the white voters, who 
have a definite numerical advan-
tage, and her h~band lost accord-
ingly. Unfonunately, a large por-
tion of the city believes Mrs. 
Pratt. 

Some people are determined to 
keep it alive in places it just does-
n't exist. 

It is true that there was a flurry 
of negative attention against Mr. 
Pratt toward the end of the cam-
paign, and a lot of it was under the 
direction of his opponent. 
However, every one of the nega-
tive ads was concerning Mr. 
Pratt's unsettling financial history, 
breaking camp'aign financing laws, 
and woeful financial booklceeping 
- to which Mr. Pratt admitted. 

Mr. Pratt's campaign was a 
mess. Before the election, he was 
already mired in scandal. During 
the election, it was worse. A cam-
paign bus park.ed direcdy outside 
a polling place and blasted Pratt-
for-mayor slogans. Mr. Pratt him-
self went to th~ wrong polling 
place, against warnings, and chat-
ted with volunteers, according to 
the poll workers, which is a direct 
violation of campaign laws. 

But above it all, Mr. Pratt him-
self was honorable enough to deny 

that that racism was a factor, 
against his wife's judgment. He 
said that race had become an issue 
because the blade community was 
unwavering while the white com-
munity became worried about his 
financial credentials. In an orderly 
financial town like Milwaukee, 
this is logical. However, he said 
that he never mentioned racism as 
a factor in his defeat. 

Furthermore, 57 percent of 
white voters voted for Mr. Pratt in 
the primary. Is this the racist 
white Milwaukee we were hearing 

" It is embarrassing that beacons of the American 
future try so hard to find 
racism where it doesn't 

exist, rather than trying to

about? 
It doesn't even stop there; 

poetic justice may also be found in 
the fact that this battle over race is 
occurring within the Democratic 
Party, the party affiliated with 
affirmative action and other racial 
quotas. 

To top off this wonderful irony, 
the third-place position in the pri-
maries went to a black conserva-
tive sheriff, David Clarke. If there 
was racism to be decried, it would 
be in his defeat. According to the 
stereotypes portrayed by the dis-

gruntled Milwaukee communities, 
whites wouldn't have voted for 
him because they are racists and 
the blacks wouldn't vote for him 
because he is conservative. So, 
while FOSS stereotypes are being -
made, why is Mr. Clarke ignored? 

As fascinating as the irony is, 
these situations are actually very 
frustrating. No matter how hard 
people try to redefine racism as an 
archaic evil, others will find it 
somewhere even more obscure 
and use it as an example ofracism 
"thriving." It doesn't matter if 
there wasn't even a shred of 
racism involved, people will create 
it. 

The answer to this conundrum 
is quite simple.'Unless there is a 
clear indication of racism afoot, 
then stop using the word for every 
failure or slight. There are a lot of 
reasons that people fail. It's a 
shame that so many people have 
to forego personal responsibility 
to lay the blame at the feet of soci-
ety . 

For the people of Milwaukee, 
this is a terrible precedent. For us 
college kids, this is the norm. For 
those of you who don't remember 
the Students First! outrage last 
year, the entire slate was disquali-
fied after several campaign viola-
tions. But of course, to the candi-
dates, it was clearly racism. The 
candidates expressed their dis-
agreement when the disqualifica-
tion was met with wonderfully 
intelligent slogans like "Racist 
bastards!" and "Take your fucking 
white privilege and kiss my ass!" 

And the worst aspect of this 
sort of lunacy is that it desensi-
tizes liS to the word "racism" and

to racist acts. Most people have 
encountered true racists at one 
point or another. It is shocking. In 
this author's opinion, it is always 
worse than you imagine it would 
be. But what is more shocking is 
that "racism" is fast becoming a 
meaningless word. It is demeaned 
each time college students cry 
wolf and hope everyone comes 
running to protest. 

As college students who were 
accepted here for intellectual 
merit, we must be better than this. 
It is embarrassing that beacons of 
the American future try so hard to 
find racism where it doesn't exist, 
rather than trying to eradicate real 
racism while appreciating the civil 
rights leaders and activists who 
have brought the country this far 
out of bigotry. One must truly be 
blind to think that we have not 
come far. 

There is a scarier underlying 
theme. Perhaps the angry protest-
ers and race-baiters are not actu-
ally upset about race, but rather 
finding a convenient way to elim-
inate all other views they disagree 
with, using race as a convenient 
catalyst. Therein lies the real, and 
shocking, possibility of racism. 

As intellectual beacons, let us 
take an example from the ridicu-
lousness of Milwaukee's mayoral 
election and try and commemo-
rate those who endure racism by 
fearing the word, rather than 
overusing it as a catchphrase.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Lack of social scene 

creates Greek tensions 
Editor: 

Regarding the two different 
opinions pri nted in the April 15 
Guardian on the UCSD Greek sys-
tem: Although this debate reveals 
the inherent differences and ten-
sions between Greek and non-
Greek students, the true problem 
lies in the fact that the social scene 
for the average UCSD student is 
almost nonexistent. Because of this, 
students are placed between a rock 
and a hard place when evaluating 
their social lives. Do we enter a fra-
terni ty or sorority that can be too 
intense or seemingly exclusive for 
some, or do we struggle nightly to 
fi nd an entertaining social scene 
amongst friends? Even despite the 
existence of non-Greek social clubs 
like the· Ultimate Frisbee team and 
religious organizations, these 
groups still cannot possibly appeal 
to the huge population of average 
students who are just bored on the 
weekends. U ntil a student can easi-
ly find a party without having to 
belong to some type of club, I fear 
the tensions and resentment toward 
Greeks and other social organiza-
tions will continue to perpetuate.

Some students value 
discussion sections 

Editor: 
To provide another point of 

view regarding discussion sections 
in the April 15 Guardian, we would 
like to share some of the generally 
positive opinions many UCSD stu-
dents have expressed regarding TAs 
and their sections. 

The Center for Teaching 
Development maintains a file of 
questionnaires completed by stu-
dents in section. Following are 
some representative comments 
from actual questionnaires. These 
comments were selected from both 
mandatory and optional attendance 
sections. 

Representative student com-
ments: 

"She promotes analyzing char-
acters and motive and encourages 
one to examine language in society 
and real ism in relation to playwrit-
ing." 

"She expands on material the 
professor didn't cover and she 
focuses on more difficult parts. I 
wish she could teach lecture." 

"He always has a current article 
which relates to the class in order to 
get students to think about how the 
class applies to the world today." 

"He frequently provides similar 
examples, which teach the con-
cepts, not memorization." 

"Having someone so knowl -
edgeable and enthusiastic introduce 
me to the subject makes it exciting 
and reaUy sparks my interest in her 
world." 

"She has a great sense of humor 
and is very energetic. She also uses 
examples other than those dis-
cussed during lecture, providing 
real-world examples." 

"She is always prepared and is an 
exceptional teacher. She provides 
students with specific examples 
from beyond the classroom." 

"She is good at incorporating 
complex thinking into activities

the fact that the social

which involve the entire class." 
"Our discussions are invigorat-

ing, and he helps us see different 
points of view, opinions and inter-
preta tions." 

"Discussions are very engaging 
and interactive." 

"He gets us to' actively partici-
pate and discuss the material among 
ourselves. Jf we miss any key points, 
he lets us know." 

"Asks srudents how they arrived 
at certain solutions to ensure they 
aren't simply plugging in to an 
equation. Very interactive with us, 
which is great!" 

"Offers information beyond 
what is required for the course, 
which is greatly appreciated and 
shows a desire to promote learning." 

"Emphasis is not on right 
answers or memorization, but

forth require deeper thinking on 
the given topic."

Chauvinist letter relied

Editor: 
Ths letter is in response to 

Adam Bronstein's misleading Letter 
to the Editor in the April 19 
G'UlmJian. In his letter, Bronstein 
falsel y accuses feminist groups of 
perpetuating the "dangerous myth 
that the vast majority of domestic

violence victims are women," citing 
the Feminist Majority Leadership 
Alliance and the A.S. Women's 
Commission's "Take Back the 
Night" as two enniples of groups 
and events that promote this 
"myth." Since the FMLA and 
"Take Back the Night" are not sole-
ly concerned with domestic vio-
lence, but mainly deal with issues of 
rape and sexual assault in general, I 
will address issues of both domestic 
violence and sexual assault in this 
letter. 

Using outdated statistics source 
from the 19805 that was based on 
faulty reasoning, Bronstein writes, 
"it has been shown that women 
attack their partners at roughly the 
same rate as men." In fact, accord-
ing to the U .S. Department of 
Justice, "intimate partner violence 
is primarily a crime against women" 
- of those victimized by an inti-
mate partner, 85 percent are 
women and 15 percent are men. In 
other words, women are five to . 
eight times more likely than men to 
be victimized by an intimate part-
ner. Furthermore, even when men 
are victimized, 10 percent are 
assaul ted by another man. In terms 
of rape and sexual assault, according 
to the National Institute of Justice 
and Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (1998), a toral of 
17.7 million American women have 
been victims of an attempted or 
completed rape in their lifetime 
(14.8 percent completed rape; 2.8 
percent attempted rape), compared 
to 2.78 mi ll ion American men 
(about 3 percent). According to the 
2002 ational Crime and 
Victimization Survey from the U.S. 
Department of Justice, in 2002, 
seven out of every eight rape vic-
tims were female. Hopefully these 
accurate and credible statistics will 
correct Bronstein 's chauvinistic, 
unfounded and poorly-researched 
statements.

OPINION 6 

Pro: Feminist resource 
groups benefit both genders 

continued from page 4 
The feminist groups on cam-

pus serve a good and worthy pur-
pose. Over two-thirds of young 
women in United States self-iden-
tify as feminists. These are 
women who can make use of the 
A.S. Women's Commission 's 
asseniveness workshops or march 
for breast cancer with the FMLA. 
These are women who can make 
use of the many services offered at 
the Women's Center, which is 
receptive to gender issues "affect-
ing women and men of diverse 
backgrounds and experiences," 
according to their Web site. 

Through these groups, women 

and men can be connected to a net-
work of people concerned with 
many different issues: reproductive 
rights; promoting the role of 
women in sports, politics, sciences; 
and women's rights in countries 
such as Mghanistan. For first-gen-
eration students and students from 
countries where women are mis-
treated, the mere existence of these 
groups is paramount, let alone the 
opportunities they provide. 

If any men feel that gender 
issues relating to them need to be 
given the spotlight tOO, by all 
means, they can declare them-
selves "feMANists" and start a 
new student organization.

9OI1lCtimes incorrect ("U he or she 
should fail his or her Muir 40 class," 
or "Did someone lose their nonsex-
ist guidelines?,,), we're really pro-
moting reverse discrimination. 
Using "man" because it is grammat-
ically correct does not attract atten-
tion. However, awkwardly substitu t-
ing "women" (or, better -
"womyn'') for the sake of gender 
equalization does stand Ollt, which 
does give one gen-
der more attention 
than the other.

(We have Women and Science and 
Engineering, the fe male counter-
part.) Why not masculinists? Why 

-not Men Fighting for Their Rights? 
Any son of male-centered orga-

nization is backwards and chauvinis-
tic. Obviously. 

T hat 's not to 
say that, as Muir 40 
so vehemently 
claims, we base our 
ideas on how we 
speak - by saying 
"woman" rather 
than "man" all the 
time, we'll all 
become feminists. 
Rather, the influx 
of such pronouns 
intO our language 
is a reflection of 
the general men-

time, against men.

Women's Center whose mission

women through support, program-

diversity and inequality." 

Granted, the center aims for 
equity in also aiming to "increase

Center - there are 
issues that, biologically, only

Fee: USA Today sponsors referendum BAC: New designs for 
Student Center presented continlltd fram PtJie I 

dents passed in campuswide elec-
tions. 

In order to publicize the fee 
referendum, USA Today has given 
the council almost S2,OOO in 
money and prizes to support its 
"get-out-and-vote" effort. 
Though the paper is among those 
receiving money under the read-
ership program, council members 
said they had struck no deals or 
promises that the program would 
continue if the referendum pass-
es. 

"[UsA Today} doesn't have any 
guarantees from us," Alexander 
said. "They know that this won't 
guarantee anything; it's up to 
council to fund based on the 
merits of the request. But they 
know that if the referendum 
doesn't pass, there is just no way 
they will have any funding next 
year." 

Under the deal, the newspaper 
will provide the college with 
posters promoting the referen-
dum vote that are free of corpo-
rate logos and do not express any 
position on the issue. In addition, 
it has given the council S600 for 
newspaper advertising, several 
sets of tickets to Padres and 
Chargers games to use as prizes 
for a raffle, and has promised to 
pay for a pizza party for the first 
floor in the college's residential 
halls in which students vote, 
Alexander said. 

Though the council voted 
unanimously to put the activity fee 
on the referendum, a handful of 
students, including Warren senior 
senator Jennifer Klage, were 
against using the .newspaper's 
money. 

"I son of feel it puts us in this 
very awlcward situation," K1age 
said. "I know that they don't 
expect anything from us, but I just 

didn't think it was the right thing 
to do. It son of feels to me that if 
the student referendum does pass, 
we have an obligation to help 
them in the future." 

However, the paper's National 
Educational Manager Doug 
Fraser said USA Today had no 
financial incentive and was inter-
ested only in promoting political 
awareness among students, like 
the national America's Youth 
Forum that it hosted across the 
country. 

"We actually love to work with 

" I sort of feel [the USA Today sponsarship] 
puts us in this very 

awkward situation. " 
- JInnif ....... EM w..n 

Co ....... ........ 
anything that encourages civil 
engagement," Fraser said, explain-
ing that the paper often helps 
schonls on an individual basis. 
"We wish they all wanted our 
assistance. " 

In order to pass, the referen-
dum needs to receive a simple 
majority of support among voters. 
However, for the vote to count, 
the college must also have a 
turnout of 15 percent, meaning at 
least 700 students. 

Warren college had the lowest 
turnout in ' this ' month's cam-
puswide A-S. runoff election, with 
only 11.4 percent of students vot-
ing. 

"[Meeting the turnout level] is 
the hardest thing that we're pro-
jecting," Blades said, explaining 
that he thought voters would sup-

ESTANCIA 

port the fee . 
In order to raise participation, 

the college will use paper ballots, 
available at the Warren and Price 
Center shuttle stops, instead of 
electronic voting on StudentLink. 
All who cast ballots will be entered 
in the raffle for the donated sports 
tickets. 

Klage, who said she neither 
supports the referendum nor 
opposes it, said she was hesitant 
about asking students to pay 
more fees at the same time as 
higher tuition costs and less 
financial aid. However, she voted 
to put the referendum on the bal-
lot. 

"I do think that students 
should have a choice," Klage said. 
"u they do feel that council needs 
the money, and it's their money, 
they should decide." 

Though he uses the college's 
Readership Program every day 
and would like to see more activ-
ities, Warren sophomore Robert 
Routley said he will vote against 
the referendum. 

"I pay the school enough 
money as it is," Routley said. 

Warren freshman Neil 
Robertson, who said he tenta-
t ively supports the fee, said he 
would rather see the money 
raised through more fiscal 
responsibility among WCSC 
members. The council started off 
the 2003-04 academic year in 
debt. 

If students vote in favor of the 
activity fee, it must still receive 
approval from university admin-
istrators, including new 
Chancellor Marye Anne FOI, 
Blades said. Should that happen, 
it would be the second-lowest fee 
assessed on campus, behind only 
Thurgood Marshall College, 
which charges students two dol-
lars per quarter. 

continued from page I 
of the General Store westward, 
near the Hump. 

"I think scheme B has a lot of 
potential for design," Brown said. 
"I'm very excited about the building 
that might start to invite the Hump 
to the composition [of the center] ." 

Members present were most 
interested with a central student 
lounge in scheme B, which includes 
glass walls to mainrain sunlight and 
heat. 

In addition to the presentation 
of the three schemes, the main top-
ics of discussion were the problems 
associated with demolishing build-
ings to construct new ones, various 
open space suggestions and the 
availability of light along the walk-
ways of the center. 

"There's a whole realm of con-
figurations; this is only the begin-
ning," Jim Brown said. 

Director of University Centers 
Gary Ratcliff recommended as lit-
tle demolition as possible when 
considering the expansion, noting 
that the UCSD GUIIT'ditm office, 
newly renovated this year, would 
have to be demolished and rebuilt 
if scheme n was adopted. 

"Construction costs are increas-
ing much higher than we had fore-
casted, and less demolition means 
less money [to spend on construc-
tion]," Ratcliff said. "We could be 
frugal and yet address all the stu-
dents' needs." 

Some expressed concern, how-
ever, with the new General Store 
being constructed toward the west 
of the Student Center, saying that 
it intruded into the Hump and the 
visibility of the Crafts Center. 

Earl Warren College 
Representative and BAC member 
Aaron Sheinbein expressed con-
cern about relocation of the cur-

rent KSDT radio and SRTV sta-
tions in the suggested plans. He 
stated that both groups desire a 
rearrangement o f their current sit-
uation, and that their new spaces 
need to be more efficiently recon-
figured. 

Sheinbein also mentioned that 
attention should be paid to stairway 
access, noting that current stai r-
ways are dark and difficult to find . 

Groundwork Books representa-
tive and BAC member Casey 
Kohler noted the importance of 
expressing public voice over the 
various design options. 

"We have to look at preserving 
the integrity and history of the 
Student Center," Kohler said. " ... I 
have to express my voice in what 
the students ask for. T here's a lot of 
history that people don't want to 
see leave, and that's important." 

BAC member Max 
Harrington, however, was con-
ce rned with the BAC 's sudden 
move to another design scheme 
and proposed a si te visit where 
issues can be discussed with ten-
ants of the Student Center. 

"We have something brand new 
that we 've never considered 
before," Harrington said . "I just 
don't feel comfortable moving for-
ward with that without maki ng 
sure [the BAC has] the input of 
everyone in the Student Center." 

Despite the overall consensus 
on scheme B, Brown noted that 
the final decision for a design will 
not be made for the next ' two to 
four weeks, after further BAC 
meetings. 

The next steps of the planning 
are scheduled for the coming weeks, 
including a sunlight availabil ity 
analysis of Student Center and a 
BAC site visit to help settle on 
which scheme to undertake.

for University Centers to renew 
the document until we have a 
concrete agreement on the 
changes." 

The oversight committee and 
University Centers will continue 
negotiations over the amendments 
and will try to reach an agreement 
by an informal May 29 deadline, 
Ratcliff said. If an agreement is not 
reached by that date, the existing 
Master Space Agreement will con-
tinue to operate on a month-to-
month basis. Ratcliff also stated 
that he would sign an agreement 
ensuring that the Master Space 
Agreement will stay in place 
through the summer without any 
changes and allow negotiations to 
resume in the fall. 

"The most important thing 
here is really open communication 
between all the panies," Pillon 
said. "That's something that is his-
torically lacking, and I think that if 
we can have open communication 
... we can really get this done and 
have it be a better document for all 
the parties involved." 

concinued from page 2 
teaching. As a teachinr assistant, 
O'Rourke said TAs felt pressure 
from the computer science and 
engineering department to "jack 
up curves- in order to keep grades 
up for unqualified students, com-
paring the level and quality of 
education to "a high school with a 
think tank bolted on top." 

Alpert said she worked on and 
supported efforts to direct more 
emphasis to teaching experience 
by administrators when deter-
mining tenure promotions and 
called the situation O'Rourke 
described "very discouraging." 

John Muir College junior 
Jared Brown, an organizer for 
the campus chapter of the 
California Srudent Public 
Interest Research Group, also 
urged Alpert to take steps to 
address excessive pricing by text-
book manufacturers. 

"The textbooks industry is 
ripping us off," he said. "They 
hold a monopoly over students' 
money and what we would like 
to see is state legislators and 
United States legislators get 
involved and do something 
about this issue." 

Alpert agreed controlling book 
costs was a priority for lawmalcers, 

saying that the price of boob has 
Icept low-income students receiv-
ing tuition waivers It community 
college &om attendinlt. 

"It~ not the fee t1at~ killing 
these people, it's the boob,-
Alpert said. 

Alpert, the chair of the state 
senate's Appropriations 
Committee, which must approve 
all spending for the state, and a 
member of the Education 
Committee, was the second 
dected representative to speak to 
UCSD students about higher 
education issues this quarter. 

• Earlier in April, Rep. Susan 
Davis (D-San Diego) also met 
with srudents. 

"The goal wu to allow sru-
dents the opportunity to discuss 
issues facing public education 
with their representatives who 
are involved in the policy making 
decisiON,· said J aced Fddman, 
the AS. director of university 
relations. who coordinated the 
lJleetings. 

FeidInan said the event with 
Alpert went well. 

"1 thought it wu a very good 
turnout. I. was actually very excit-
ed to see that number of people 
that thought it wu important to 
have this discussion," he said. 

COIUinwed from Part I 
Council Chair Travis Silva 

~e.sed the idea that senators be 
responsible to their individual col-
leges and not paid by the AS. 
Council. 

"They're put of the colJese 
councils first and AS. second, and 
I don't dUnk AS. should be issuing 
them sti ds, - Silva said. "I think 
it wouI~ the student body • 
lot of money. " 

Thurgood Marshall College 
junior senator Kate Pillon was 
generally pleased with the recom-
mendations and said that the pro-
portional cuts were fair. 

"Stipends are just supposed to 
be a gesture, and 1 feel like if we're 
extending that gesture to all the 
other main positions on A.S . ... the 
senators shouldn't be taken away 
from that," Pillon said. 

Another argument raised on 
behalf of senator stipends wu that 
having senators on the university 
payroll enables them to use the 
A.S. golf cart and access resources 
such as a copy card. 

Silva called the ides a "garbage 
argument" and claimed that he has 
checked out the AS. cart and has 
been issued a copy card even 
though he does not hold a stipend 
position.

Responsibility for Getting 
Involved, Giving Input, and 
Managing a larger Budget. 

"They're not worried about it 
with me, 10 why are they all of a 
sudden worried about it for sena-
tors?- Silva said. 

While senator stiperub remain 
a contentious issue, few coun-
cilmembers raised objections to 
stipends for Qecutives and com-
missioners. 

"It is my experience, at least, 
that commissioners and Qecutive 
positions are running services, 
they're actually performing jobs 
and tub ... that they have to per-
form during business hours and 
they find themselves at a real disad-
vantage in terms of getting a job," 
Silva said. 

Ultimately, the next A.S. 
Council has the power to approve 
or amend the stipend recommen-
dations set forth in Pae's budget. 

Pillon said she would vote for a 
budget regardless of the amount of 
senator stipends. 

"1 feel like it would be a testa-
ment to us IS senators to say, 'You 
mow what, we need to cut some-
thing and this is the best thing to 
cut right now, even if it means that 
we're not stipended,'" Pillon said. 

Webster expressed hope that a 
point has been reached where the 
amount allocated from S.T.I.P. is 
less than what is generated. 

"I believe that this level of 
stipends is maintainable," Webster 
said. "1 think that next year we 
should see them be able to pay at 
least this much in stipends again, if 
not a little bit more. " 

An attempt to pull the stipend 
recommendation from the Finance 
Conunittee in order to discuss the 
legislation on the council floor 
failed by a vote of 4-12-0. This 
forced the council to accept the 
cOnumUtteel recommendation to 
approve the item. 

MMW: 
Strict rules 
required, 
Scott says 

COIUinutd from ". 3 
given in MMW. According to Scott 
and MMW Program Assistant 
Director Jacqueline Giordano, the 
focus on research papers, as 
opposed to more writing-oriented 
programs in other colleF.' lends 
itself more to academic dishonesty. 
ERC also has the longest core 
sequence of all colleges, with six 
required quaeten of MMW, result-
ing in a larger number of students 
in the core sequence at anyone 
time. 

"We knew that there was a lot of 
concern about this," Giordano said. 
"Bear in mind that our assignments 
are different. There is a greater 
potential for 'borrowing' from 
Web sites or somewhere else (if 
you're writing a research paper) 
than if you're writing an analysis." 

Scott said that ERC~ policy was 
re-evaluated between the fall and 
winter quarters of the 2003-04 aca-
demic year, resulting in changes in 
the types of cases that would be 
forwarded from the program for 
adjudication. According to 
Giordano, positive matches that 
are the result of carelessness and 
demonstrate no intent to plagiarize 
are now generally not referred to 
the dean or recorded in a studentl 
permanent record. 

"1. am very confident that the 
academic coordinators who are 
affiliated with the MMW program 
have been extremely thorough and 
take their responsibility very sen-

• ously because they understand the 
importance of an allegation of aca-
demic misconduct and how it can

Senior job hunt 
The road to a dream care.r 

" . 
: . 

.. 

.. 

T he days are creeping closer to graduation in June, and you have no idea what 
you're going to do doing after-
wards. You want a job, but have 
been slacking in trying to find 
one. It is not too late, though, 
because there are resources on 
campus offered by Career Services 
Center and the Alumni 
Association that make finding a 
job or internship much easier. 
The staff is dedicated and friend-
ly, and there are countless ways 
they can help you land your dream 
job. 

"The most important thing is 
to try to identify what type of a 
job you are interested in and to 
develop a goal," Craig Schmidt, 
the assistant director of Career 
Services Center, said. "It is very 
difficult to job hunt if you don't 
have a goal you're looking for. 
You'U say, 'I'll take whatever's out 
there' - that typically doesn't 
work for most employers. They 
want to know that you've identi-
fied a type of position in their 
organization you want." 

Once you have identified what 
kind of job you want, there are 
many useful strategies for finding 
a job. Simply looking at job list-
ings in a newspaper is not going to 
help; diversify your job search as 
much as possible. 

"We are coming out of a fairly 
difficult job market over the past 
three years," Schmidt said. 
"There are signs that things are 

-

improving. There is an increase in 
the kinds of positions that are 
available. However, it is still a 
tough job market for many, so you 
need to use a variety of methods 
when you're job seeking." 

An internship is a helpful way 
of finding a job. Having that expe-
rience can truly help you find out 
whether you are cut out for a par-
ticular job. In addition, it helps to 
make career-related contacts. 

"The most effective way has 
been using previous experience to 
lead them to a career," Schmidt 
said. "The student could use an 
internship experience and try to 
convert that to a full-time posi-
tion, or to get leads from that 
internship to a full-time position. 
T hat is probably the best way to 
get a job. A lot of students get 
their foot in the door through 
internships. Even if you've had no 
career-related experience in the 
field you want to get into, it is not 
too late to get an internship. It is 
getting late, but you need to find a 
way to do that." 

Networking is arguably one of 
the most important ways to land a 
job. The old adage that "it isn't 
what you know, but who you 
know" certainly proves true in the 
job market. Sometimes it is not 
the most qualified candidate who 
gets the job offer, but the best-
connected candidate. 

Making contacts at an intern-
ship is invaluable, but you should 
not worry if you don't have that, 

since the goals of the Alumni 
Association and Career Services 
Center are to provide networking 
events and resources for students. 

Career Services Center's Web 
site, bttp://",rur.ucsd.edu, contains 
the Career Consultant Network 
- an online network of several 
hundred professionals in the local

community whom students can 
network with. These professionals 
may not necessarily hire the stu-
dent, but they will probably give 
them tips and leads on the job 
market, or some inside informa-
tion about companies that are hir-
ing. 

Career Services Center's Web 

site also provides a link to more 
than sixty professional associa-
tions, most of which have local 
chapters in San Diego. These 
associations can be a useful way to 
expand your network of contacts, 
to help you learn about openings

UCSD libraries hold various untapped resources

"'The hean and soul of the uni-
versity is research," according to 
Marlo Young, the Undergraduate 
Outreach Coordinator 'at Geisel 
Library. 

Although university libraries are 
often seen as the place for serious 
academic research, they are avail-
able for less rigorous pursuits as 
well. With events, exhibits, movies, 
magazines, microfilm, and yes, 
even books, the libraries at UCSD 
have numerous untapped resources 
that you should take advantage of. 

UCSD libraries ~bKribe W 
over 70 different newspapers from 
across the nation and around the 
world, so you can read ~ch papers 
as the Mosanv NnDS and the J"ptm 
Tmm in English. 

In addition to newspapers, there 
are over 2,700 journals and maga-
zines at the various libraries on 
campus. Among these are The 
Economist, National Geographic, 
and Wired. Magazines are publicly 
available and are a great way to 
rew and stay in touch with current 
happenings. Less educational mag-
azines are also available. CLICS,

IT you would rather sit back and 
enjoy yourself than read, the Film 
and Video library in Geisel is the 
place to go. Thousands of videos 
are available for viewing, from 
Hollywood feature films such as 
"Fantasia" and "Terminator 2" to 
coWldess independent and foreign 
productions. You can watcb 
episodes of~Rocky and Bullwinlde" 
on laserdisc and "Attack of the 
Killer Tomatoes!" on VHS. 
Graduate srudents and undergrad-
uate scholars can check videos and 
DVDs out of the library to view at 
their own leisure. For the musicaUy 
inclined, sheet music is available for 
checkout from the Music Library. 

"The equipment could be bet-
ter, but overall it is efficient," John 
Muir College senior Nancy 
Hossain said. "I think the 6lm and 
video library is good enough and 
gets the job done. I have used it for 
a number of classes. " 

library exhibits and events offer 
a chance to feast your eyes and 
expand your mind. Currendy on 
exhibit is "The An of Guitar 
Making," which runs until jWle II , 
detailing the steps of acoustic guitar 
consttuction and the choices that 
make guitar building an an. It will be 
in the Fine Arts Library's display 
cases, on the lower levd of the west 
wing of Geisel Library. The exhibit 
will include photos of the process, 
tools and guitar pans from various 
guitar makers - both from guitar 
factories and single-person shops. 
The library is even sponsoring live 
musical performances w accompeny 
the exhibit. On May 12 at 12:30 
p.m., jazz guitarist Peter Sprague

From the main library Web

options can be a bit overwhelming. 

ROGER is UCSD's online cata-

musical scores and other materials 
are available on campus. You can 
search ROGER by author, title, lrey-

Students face the consequences of fake ID cards 
Police crack doWn on growing trend in underage alcohol purchases 

ayAlDQUICK 
StIff Writer 

Landen Hawke is a 19-year-old 
John Muir College sophomore who 
considered investing $100 in a fake 
ID. Like many underage American 
college students, he said he just 
wants the freedom to responsibly 
enjoy a little alcohol when he feels 
like it. A phony identification card 
eliminates common problems suf-
fered by an underage drinker: no 
more leaning 00 friends, no more 
losing money co the beer man and, 
most importantly, no more just 
wishing you were out at a bar with 
friends. 

Hawke is like millions of colle~ 
students all over America, caught 
between the frustrating freedom of 
age 18 and the limitations of the 
21-year-old drinking age. 

"It's stupid. We're old enough 
to vote and die for our country, 
but not old enough drink a beer," 
Muir sophomore Lindsay Young 
said. 

The drinJcing age was the focus 
of attention for a short time in the 
summer of 2001 when President 
George W Bush's daughter, Jeona, 
was caught drinking Wlderage 
twice in less than two months. The 
second time she was buying a mar-
garita with a fake ID. Some media 
sources called the scandal 
-Marguitapte." 

Despite the attention, 
Mtrpritapte hu not changed 
things. Fake IDs are still in demand 
and students can obtain them with 
a pusport pboco and u little u S40. 
The IDOIt IUCCCIIfuIIDs, however, 
come £rom older libliap or &iends 

who pass on their driver's licenses. 
While counterfeit IDs may 

seem commonplace, many students 
doo't!mow what the risks are. The 
general impression seems to be that 
possessing a fake ID or buying 
alcohol with one is not a serious 
offense. 

"It can't be that bad," Young 
said. "So many people have 
them." 

The Price 
Twelve people were arrested for 

attempting to purchase alcohol 
with bogus identification at a local 
Sav-On Dtugs on Feb. 27, a Friday 
night. The UCSD Police teamed 
up with the Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control and 
the San Diego Police Department 
in an operation called "Cops-In-
Shops." The objective of the pro-
gram was to address alcohol abuse 
and binge drinking by college stu-
dents. 

The dozen individuals caught 
that night now face two misde-
meanor charges. The charges usu-
ally result in a fine and communi-
ty service. Also, conviction on the 
charges results in a one-year dri-
ver's license suspension. The same 
also applies for other common 
college-aied crimes, ~ch as pos-
session or alcohol under the age of 
21 and pQssession of small 
amounts of marijuana. Hiring an 
attomey might save your license, 
bot attorney's fees usually begin at 
S6OO. 

~ s:: about what you do 
and you areIl't going co have any 

problems," Sgt. Dave Rose of 
UCSD Police said. 

Since merely possessing a fake 
ID is a misdemeanor, students 
should be wary of them. Students 
have been busted when lost wal-
lets were rurned in to police and 

the fake ill was discovered while 
trying to identify the wallet's 
owner. 

According w Rose, police are 
much more toneerned about nab-
bing fake ID owners than merely 
busting lcids who drink in modera-

tion, because fake ID owners tend to 
supply other students with alcohol. 
Also, manufacturing IDs is a felony, 
and people who buy bogus IDs are 
encouraging serious criminals.

and to truly become sophisticat-
ed about the field. 

The Alumni Association also 
has many networ1cing resources 
for students on campus. They 
organize alumni-student mixers, 
which welcome new UCSD 
graduates and introduce them to 
alumni. One of these mixers 
arranged over the summer 
proved to be very successful. 
Each new graduate introduced 
himself and what he was interest-
ed in. This allowed the alumni 
related [0 that field in the room 
to seek out the particular gradu-
ate and speak with him or her. 

"Three people got intern-
ships or jobs our of that night, n 
John Valva, executive director of 
the Alumni Association, said. 
"One girl really wanted to work 
at Disney - we made it happen." 

The Alumni Association is 
hosting an6ther mixer named 
"Life 101." It will cover every-
thing a student can expect to face 
after graduation. Topics include 
surviving the job search, first job 
expectations, debt management-
,and home rentals and purchases. 
Following a panel discussion, 
graduating seniors will get the 
chance to network with alumni 
one-on-one to get the inside 
edge on success after graduation. 
This free event will take place 
April 27 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at 
Gallery A in Price Center. 

Apart from networking, job 
listings are also a wonderful 
resource to finding a job. Port 
Triton, the online service offered 
through Career Services Center, 
is a great way to sift through 
internship and full-time and 
part-time job positions. 

"Companies are targeting 
UCSD by listing their jobs on 
Port Triton - it's not like they 
are sending that job listing to the 
whole world," Schmidt said. "It 
is a very focused type of an 
opportunity; they are looking 
specifically for UCSD students 
to fill those job positions." 

There are many other Web 
sites targeted to helping San 
Diego residents find a job 
besides Port Triton, like 
SanDiegoJobs.com, a compre-
hensive local job resource show-
casing San Diego's employers. 
In addition to job listings, it also 
offers a free resume service and 
e-mail job alerts. The site allows 
you to search for jobs not only in 
San Diego, but also in other 

California cities such as 
Riverside, Sacramento, Los 
Angeles, Oakland, San Jose and 
San Francisco. One of the perks 
of the site is that there is no reg-
istration required. Visit the site 
at http://W.ulul.Slmditgojobs.cl1m. 

CareerBuilder.com is another 
great Web site targeted to the job 
search. It allows one [0 search for 
jobs by city, and it contains job 
listings for all the states. This site 
also gives advice and offers 
resources for finding the perfect 
job, including listing career fairs 
in different cities. Resumes can be 
posted on the site so it is easier to 
send to employers. Start looking

Part of getting a good job 
involves self-marketing. Without 
a good cover letter, resume or 
interview, it is nearly impossible 
to get a good position. It is neces-
sary to have resumes and cover 
letters targeted to the lcind of 
positions you are interested in. 
Career Services Center provides 
help in shaping up these three 
important aspects of the job 
search. 

Students can get their most 
pressing career question

15-minute advising session with 

one of the Career Services 
Center's expert career advisors. 
Students have the opportunity to 
meet one-on-one with an advisor 
to discuss a single areer issue. 
Hours for this service are 1: 3 0 
p.m. to 4 p.m. on Mondays, 
Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 
1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on 
Wednesdays. 

To hone interviewing skills,

on-camera practice interviewing 
workshops throughout the year. 
In a small group setting, you can 
practice answering typical inter-
view questions on camera and 
receive immediate feedback from 
an advisor and fellow students. 
Space is limited. so it is a good 
idea to get there early. This work-
shop wi II be offered on April 27, 
May 12, May 24 and June 18 at 
Career Services Center. 

In any case, it is important to 
be strong and consistent in a job 
search. When you see a position 
you are interested in and quali-
fied for, get on it immediately by 
sending in resumes and cover 
letters. An aggressive approach 
to the job search process is need-
ed because jobs will not find 
themselves. 

"Seniors should also approach 
the job search as if it were a job," 
Schmidt said. "You need to plan 
time to do things - you can't just 
do them on the fly. If you have 
three hours between classes, you 
need to block that time on your 
schedule and put that time to 
good use. Work on resumes, make 
networking phone calls and con-
tact career consultants. Be 
methodical about it - don't 
shortchange the job search 
process. The people who are real-
ly getting the jobs are the ones 
who are putting their energies 
into it." 

Recent graduates can make 
use of these services by joining 
the Alumni Association. The 
annuaJ fee is discounted to $35 
from S40 for the first six months 
after graduation. This gives the 
alumnus a year's access to all the 
resources at the Career Services 
Center, including Port Triton 
and career counseling.

tion on alumni-student network-
ing events, visit the Alumni 
Association Web site at

Library: Students find more 
than just research tools here 

continued from J>iJge I I 
library account to see what books 
you have checlced out, or are on 
hold, and you can even renew books 
with the click of a mouse. 

An additional benefit of having 
a P.I.N. is the ability to request 
books from one UCSD library be 
delivered and placed on hold for 
you at any other UCSD library. 
This means if you live in Revelle 
College you can request books 
from the Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography library and pick 
them up at CLICS. To do this, sim-
ply click the "Request" button in 
ROGER when you find the book 
you would like to request and select 
the most convenient library as your 
pick-up location. 

If the rna terial you are looicing 
for is not available at UCSD, the 
"Search in Circuit" button at the top 
of the ROGER search page is a 
handy tool. It allows you to broaden 
your search to the Circuit, the com-
bined library atalogs ofUCSD, San 
Diego State, USD and Cal State San 
Marcos. 

When searching in the Circuit, 
you can request materials not avail-
able at UCSD from another library 
in the Circuit. Simply click on the 
"Request this Item" link and fiJJ in 
the required information. In order 
to make a request, you will need a 
P.I.N. as described above. Requests 
from the Circuit usually arrive the 
next working day. 

MeIvyI is the catalog of all the 
libraries in the UC system. Taken 
together, the UC libraries have 
more books than any other library in 
America, save the Library of 
Congress, so there is a good liIceli-
hood that you will be able to find 
what you are looking for on Melvyl. 
Books requested through Melvyl 
typically arrive within a week or two. 

MI use the Melvyl catalogue a 
lot, " FJeanor Roosevelt sophomore 
Purwa Bansod said. "It is definitely 
a good tool, since you can see 
resources available at other schools 
that might not be available here at 
UCSD. It realJy helps when you're 
doing research for a class. " 

Another powerful online 
resource is Sage, a collection of elec-
tronic resources. The resources have 

been collected by the library staff for 
their usefulness in research. Sage is 
searchable by subject, keyword and 
even by the: type of resource. A fun 
way to learn about the world is by 
browsing though the resources of 
"fun things." This includes such 
jewels as "Brimey Spears' Guide to 
Semiconductor Physics" and 
"Molecules with Silly or Unusual 
Names." 

A final resource available from 
the main page for locating infor-
mation is the list of databases. 
Many of these databases are acces-
sible to UCSD students and facul-
ty, but not to the general public. 
Those accessing the databases from 
off campus will need to configure 
their browser to use UCSD's proxy 
server. It is a simple procedure and 
instructions can be found at 
hnp:ll/ibrllrits.ucsJ.ttWproxy. 

The databases are quite varied 
in their scope and rather numer-
ous, but definitely worth a once-
over. One database that deserves 
more than just a glance for the 
news savvy is LexisNexis, which is a 
vast searchable storehouse of arti-
cles on news, law and medicine. It 
contains texts of thousands of pub-
lications stretching back a number 
of years. 

While the library's Web site is a 
good place to poke around and dis-
cover new things that you didn't 
know about, you can really only 
scratch the surface of what the 
libraries have to offer. To reap the 
true benefits, you actually have to 
go in to one and talk to a librarian. 

"The staff is very helpful and 
friendly," Molina said. "They do a 
great job in answa1ng questions and 
directing you to the right places." 

The library employees are 
friendly and always willing to help. 
Paul Harris, the manager of the 
Current Periodicals, Newspapers 
and Microfonns Information Desk, 
always encourages students. 
. "Come to the information 
desks, don't be shy," he said. 

The quality of the resources 
available at the library is 
unmatched, especially when com-
pared to public search engines. 

MGoogIe and Yahoo should be 
the last places you look, " Young said.

I HOROSCOPES 
Aria (March 21 to April 19)-
It's important for you to be nice. Be 
polite, especially when you dis-
agree with somebody. It's a test of 
your good manoen and your abili-
ty to lead. 

TauNi (April 20 to May 20) -If 
you continue to follow the rules 
you've learned, youll continue to 
save. Others may call you a penny-
pincher, but you'll laugh all the way 
to the bank. 

Gemini (May 21 to June 21) -
Limit your spending a while 
longer. There's nothing you need 
that you can't do without for a 
while - except education. Stop by 
the library. 

Cancer (June 22 to July 22) -
There's no sense letting people 
believe you'll go left when you 
intend to go right. You try to avoid 
a conflict when you can, but some 
things require you to take a stand. 

Leo Ouly 2) to Aug. 22) - Better 
recheck your data before you pro-
ceed. Garbage in leads to garbage 
out. Test the accuracy of your 
information. 

VUJO (Aug. 2) to Sept. 22) - An 
argument about money could bring 
out the other guys nasty side. A 
sharply spoken word can hun, but 
don't take it too seriously. You'll get 
OYer it with the help of • good meal. 

Libra (Sept. 2) to Oct. 22) - It's 
still not a rood idea to say whatev-
er you feel. Advise your usociates 
to be similarly autious. Bener safe 
than sorry. 

Scorpio (Oct. 21 to Nov. 21) -
In meetinBS and workplace discus-

sioos, you're more likely to learn 
what's wrong than what's right. If 
you want to know, just ask. If you 
don't, stay out of earshot. 

Sagittari ... (Nov. 22 to Dec. 21) 
- A loved one may nOt initially 
understand why you're holding the 
purse strings so tight. &plain how 
important it is to have some money 
staShed away. Your lesaon may be 
remembered. 

Capricom (Dec. 22 to J .... 19)-
There are a lot of ways to get your 
meaning across, and verbal com-
munication is just one of the ways. 
If words fail you, try a different 
approach. 

Aquari ... (J .... 20 to Feb. 18)-
Something that looked good on 
paper may have Bawa that went 
undetected. When you actually 
start to use this concept, you'll find 
the flaws. Bet on it. 

PiIca (Feb. 19 to March 20) -

How to choose and use 
sunscreen effectively 

to your 
health 

Neha Singh 
How often should I be using 

sunscreen? What do the differ-
ent SPFs on the label mean? 

-Anonymous 

With temperarures rising, it is 
hard not to spend more time out-
side. Protecting your skin is a must, 
though, since ultraviolet (UV) rays 
can have many negative effects 
including various skin cancers and 
premature aging of the skin. 

"Because we live in Southern 
California, you want to have sun-
screen all year," Dori Rosengerg, a 
health outreach coordinator at 
Student Health Services, said. 
"Even if it is cloudy outside, the 
UV rays will go right through the 
atmosphere." _ 

Sunscreen tends to wear off 
after two hours, so reapply often. If 
you go in the water, reapply it after 
you get Out. Also, put it on at least 
15 minutes before you go outside 
since it takes a while to sink in and 
rea lly be effective. 

You mi ght worry about not 
bei ng able to tan if you wear 
sunscreen every day. 
However, it is impossible to 
block all the rays needed to 
get a tan if you spend some 
amount of time in the sun-
light everyday. 

"Even if you wear sun-
screen with a high SPF, 
you are not going to get 
loo-percent protec-
tion since you are 
still going to get 
some exposure to 
UV rays," 
Rosenberg said. 
"We are Out so 
much in tbe sun 
here in San Diego 
that it does not 
matter if we wear 
sunscreen everyday 
- we will still get a 
tan." 

It is also a good 
idea to wear sun-
screen on your lips, 
since they are a very 
sensitive part of 

every day, since that number would 
block most of the sun's rayS. 
However, if you will be out in the 
sun for more than an hour, use an 
SPF 30. If you will be sweating a 
lot, you may want to use an SPF 30 
on your face no matter what, 
because the sweat will quickly thin 
the sunscreen down to the equiva-
lent of SPF IS. Anything less than . 
SPF 15 will not adequately protect 
your skin. 

PABA or PABA-free 
PABA (short for para-aminoben-

zoic acid) is used in many sun-
screens. It works well, but some pe0-
ple are allergic to it, which is why 
sunscreens are available PABA free. 

Bro.d spectrum 
The sun shoots off two different 

rays that affect your skin: UVA and 
UVB. UVA rays make your skin 
wrinkle and may cause skin cancer. 
UVB rays bum. A broad-spectrum 
sunscreen helps protect your skin 
from both rays. . 

Waterproof 
Waterproof sunscreens are not 

just important when you are swim-
ming and swiing - they also stay 
on longer when you sweat. If you are 
active in or out of the water, a water-
proof product may be right for you. 

Lotion, cream or 
gel 

The type of sunscreen 
you choose depends on which you 
like best. You may want to use a 

~eam on your face, since gels 
can sting around your eyes. If 
you have acne, try a light-tex-
ture sunscreen first: If water-

proof sunscreen causes 
breakouts, re-apply reg-
ular sunscreen more 
often, instead.

18 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY. APIUL 26. 2004 

National Student-Athlete Day banquet honors exceptional Tritons 
By BRYAN TSAO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Outstanding UCSD student-
athletes were honored at a banquet 
at the Faculty Club on April 22, 
National Student-Athlete Day. 
The 11 athletes chosen are juniors 
and seniors selected for their 
accomplishments on and off the 
field. The banquet featured 
remarks by Director of Athletics 
Earl W. Edwards, the presentation 
of awards by Academic Senate chair 
Jan Talbot and a speech by honoree 
Jonathan Shum. 

"As far as academic success, 
UCSD's student-athletes are a 
reflection of UCSD's overall com-
mionent to excellence in higher 
education." Edwards said. 
"UCSD's student-athletes' excel-
lence in the classroom. as well as on 
the field, consistendy earns recog-
nition with teams and individuals 
being nam~d academic All-
Americans. » 

The student-athletes recog-
nized include baseball co-captain 
Rafael Bergstron; women's volley-
ball co-captain and Division n All-
American Teresa Ohta; men's ten-
nis player Arnir Nejad; women's 
volleyball player and first-team AlI-
Conference member Bonnie 
Wilson; women's basketball player 
and all-time scoring leader Ali 

Ginn; men's soccer player and co-
captain Jonathan Shum; women's 
water polo co-captain and II-time 
Provost Honors student Rachael 
K1eidon; men's crew co-captain 
Eric Hardeman; womens fencing 
team member and seven-time 
Provost Honors student Lauren 

" UCSD's student .. 
athletes are a reflection 
. of UCSD's overall 

commitment to 
excellence in higher 

education. " 
- E.t W. EdwMIs. DIrIdDr of 

Athletics 

Muir; mens golf team member Jan 
Godoski; and Triton Athletes 
Council chair and women's track 
captain Hillary Mills. 

"I'm honored that I was asked 
to be here," ' Wilson said. 
"Especially listening to all the 
people, all the accomplishments 
of the students here, it's amazing 
how intelligent they are and how 

much they've accomplished. So 
I'm excited that I'm considered 
one of them. " 

Several of the student-athletes 
honored attributed their success to 
time-management skills. 

"I think it's all about making 
sure you don't waste time," 
Hardeman said. "You always have 
to make sure you're always doing 
something, whether its condition-
ing or practice or studying. You just 
want to make sure you're not wast-
ing time watching 1V or hanging 
out too much. ¥ou have to have 
your fun, but always do some-
thing." 

Edwards believes that UCSD 
derives its academic and athletic 
success from having a winning tra-
dition and strong academic reputa-
tion. UCSD is the only school in 
Division n not to ofter scholar-
ships, but is currendl;ond in the 
Directors Cup stan' . 

"I think a lot of it has to do with 
the fact that we have a winning tra-
dition; when you look at our acade-
mic standards as well, it's a very 
attractive package for an athlete 
who is looking for both," Edwards 
said. "Especially since we've moved 
to Division D, we're starting to 
recruit those athletes that we would 
lose before, who would go to the 
Ivy Leagues, or the Naval 
Academy."

continued from page 20 

Anteaters, despite losing a three-
goal lead and being forced into 
overtime. Junior driver Jessica 
Wong finally capped off the long 
weekend with a four-meter penalty 
shot at 7 minutes, 31 seconds into 
sudden-death overtime. Wong and 
senior two-meter defender Meris 
Santilan-Smith each picked up a 
hat uick, while Lyman and junior 
driver Courmey Clevenger each 
conuibuted a goal to the effort. 

"We had a lot of different peo-
ple scoring, and fina lly we had that 
confidence getting the ball in the 
cage," senior goa lie Stephani e 
Lombardo said. Lombardo regis-
tered eight and seven saves against 
Hawaii and UC Irvine, respective-
ly. 

The offensive push kept pres-
sure off the UCSD defense, which 
managed to hold its own in crucial 
situations. After scoring six goals 
through three quarters, Hawaii was 
held to only one in the final seven 
minutes. UC Irvine scored twice in 
the fourth period to lead its come-
back, but was stymied offensively 
and eventually tired out in over-
time. 

"We held our ground and were 
able to score ... we bent a little bit, 
but we didn't break," UCSD head 
coach Larry Sanders said. 

UCSD's elasticity reached a 
breaking point against Cal State 
Northridge, who, with three head-
to-head victories in 2004, has had 
the Tritons' number. With the aid 
of Bantilan-Srnith's pair of scores, 
UCSD battled back from a 3-1 
deficit, but could not close it out in 
the fourth . Chari Christopher hit 
three of the Matadors' four goals in 
the final period to finish off the 
struggling Tritons. Graziella 
Caredda helped keep the Tritons 
out of the cage with seven saves, 
while Lombardo stopped five on 
her end. 

"We worked our way back from 
being down, let out a sigh of relief 
and got too relaxed," Lombardo 
said. "We thought that because we 
had lost twice, it was our turn to 
win. We learned that other teams 
aren't going to roll over for us." 

Nobody expected much out of 
the Tritons as they squared off with 
21-0 USC, but UCSD battled its 
way to only a one-goal deficit at the 
end of the first quarter. 
Unfortunately, that's when the 
Trojans started hitting what 

CMinI WrbetIGUllrtltm file 
Take your best shot: Senior 2·meter defender Meris Bantilan-Smith and the 
Tritons' women's water polo squad posted a 2·2 record at the LBSU Invitational. 
Lombardo called "superhuman 
shots." . 

"These weren't normal shots," 
Lombardo said. "One long shot 
skipped on the water all along the 
way and went ccoSs-cage." 

The solid shooting contributed 
to six USC goals in the second 
period and an 11-2 advantage by 
the time the Trojans' Eszter Gyori 
taUied her fourth score at the 2:53 
mark in the third. Somewhere 
between the stifling shots, the 
Tritons managed to score four 
more, led by a Clevenger hat trick. 

"The losses and the meeting 
afterward fueled us to work harder. 
Larry (Sanders 1 was really disap-
pointed with us, and we were disap-
pointed with ourselves, so we fired 
ourselves up to play those next two 
games," Lombardo said. 

Being humbled did the trick, as 
the Tritons found themselves down 
but not out in the next twO games. 
After being down 5-4 early in the 
third period against Hawaii, five 
different Tritons scored to put 
UCSD over the top. With 4:55 left 
in the game, Lyman sealed the vic-
tory, giving the Tritons a two-goal 
margin they wouldn't relinquish. 

Battling No.6 UC Irvine in a 4-
4 draw at halftime was invigorating 
enough for the Tritons, but the 
shots that were falling were the 
confidence-boosters that UCSD 
needed for the win . 

"Loyola Marymount, our rivals, 
are ranked No. 7, and this win gave 
us the confidence that, if we are 
making our shots, we can play with 
any team," Sanders said. 

UCSD went up 7-4 at the 2:10 

mark in the third period against 
UC Irvine, but the cushion wasn't 
enough to seal the victory just yet. 
The Anteaters, taking advantage of 
a couple of UCSD turnovers, hit 
three goals, including two quick 
strikes at the beginning of the 
fourth, to send the Tritons into 
overtime. 

"The turnover that UC Irvine 
used to score was more of the offi-
cial not making the call," Sanders 
said. "I thought it was a bad call ... 
our opponents got some calls their 
way, though." 

The Tritons finalJy got the one 
call they needed when they drew a 
four-meter penalty late into sudden 
death. After 18 scoreless minutes, 
Wong finally sunk the game-win-
ner to complete the long weekend. 

"No one wants to play nine 
quarters of water polo, but it was 
good to know that we can capital-
ize, know we can stay up and play 
hard," Lombardo said. . 

The Tritons were mentally and 
physically prepared for the April 24 
and April 25 \V\VPA tournament 
in the final days before the contest. 

"The confidence of knowing 
they can play has made practices 
easier," Sanders said. "There's a lot 
more energy going around, and 
more positive vibes. They ~ow 
that they can play with anybody." 

That energy was a key factor in 
UCSD's winning performances 
April 24, as the Tritons beat UC 
Davis and Cal State Hayward en 
route to the championship game, 
where they were shut down by 
Loyola Maryrnount in a 7.-3 
match.

......... UCSO DirecfDr of Athletics Earl W Edwards presents awards 10 stellar 
student-athletes at a banquet for National Student-Athlete Day on April 22. 

Women's volleyball coach 
Duncan McFarland, who had two 
players honored, also believes that 
the combination of strong acade-
mics and successful athletics 
allows UCSD to recruit top play-
ers despite the lack of scholar-
ships. 

"Because the school attracts 
kids who are looking for that aca-
demic challenge, the ones that 
also have a lot of athletic ability 
see that as a bonus that they can 
do both things here," McFarland 
said. "The fact that we have the 
good athletes that we've been able 

to get, I think that's attractive. It's 
like our success in the past is 
something that we've been able to 
build on to bring in more good 
athletes in the future." 

Since the school's establishment 
in 1960, 126 UCSD student-ath-
letes have been named academic 
All-American Ind been awarded 19 
NCAA postgraduate scholarships. 
Edwards predicted that two UCSD 
students would win postgraduate 
scholarships this year. Only 174 
scholarships are awarded each year 
to student-athletes from 1,025 
institutions.

COIUinued from /Xlcr 20 
senior two-meter Lesha Bounds 
each contributed to the second-
period flurry. 

With only one goal, senior 
two-meter defender Meris 
Bantilan-Smith had a relatively 
quiet game on offense, but 
stepped up her defensive game by 
repeatedly denying UC Davis 
any room to score. 

With help from Bantilan-
Smith's gritty play, the Tritons 
staved off a UC Davis threat in 
the third period. The Aggies ral-
lied to score three points, capital-
izing on two man-up advantages, 
cutting UCSD's lead to 8-5. The 
flustered UC Davis squad would 
find itself shut down to one goal 
in the fourth period. Triton 
defense also held the NCAA 
women's water polo all-time 
leading scorer, UC Davis' 
TIffany Hodgens, to just a pair of 
scores. 

"We capitalized on a few of 
their mistakes, and we ran with 
that intensity the rest of the 
game," Lombardo said. 

UCSD's. momentum carried 
ovef from its commanding 13-3 
quarterfinal triumph over Cal 
State Hayward. The key to victo-
ry was once again the Tritons' 
eight-person scoring push, led by 
a hat trick from junior Jaemi 
Jackson, followed by pairs from 
Bantilan-Smith, Wong and 
sophomore driver Flynn 
LaRochelle, who has been 
instrumental in scoring off the 
bench. 

The Tritons drew first blood, 
but Cal State Hayward struck 
with a pair of goals to keep 
things close at 4-2 . As the 
defense finally dug in, UCSD 
pulled away with five unan-
swered goals in the second peri-
od. The Pioneers never led 
once, nor did they register a 
pulse until they scored a conso-
lation goal in the fourth. 

The Tritons found themselves 
in a familiar, almost perennial, 
position in staring down Loyola 
Marymount for the WWPA tide 
on April 25 at BUrns Recreation 
and Aquatics Center. 

"We need to bring that same 
intensity and come out aware, 
because if we slow down, Loyola 
Marymount will capitalize on all 

those opportunities," Lombardo 
said before the game. "But 
Loyola Marymount is going to be 
shocked at our intensity; we're 
not the same team. It 

The Lions came out for the 
championship game ready to kill, 
and held the Tritons scoreless 
through the first half, going on a 
4-0 run through two periods. 

The Tritons were finally 
allowed to pick up the intensity 
of their game in the third period, 
beating Loyola Marymount, 2-1, 
but still bearing a significant dis-
advantaged entering the final 
seven-minute quarter, 5-2 . 

The drive that UCSD sought 
was nowhere to be found, and the 
Tritons succumbed to the Lions, 
7-3. 

UCSD played in four of the 
last five WWPA championship 
games, only to come up ~ort 
against Loyola Marymount every 
time, With each game, the 
Thtons have come closer and 
closer to finally !mocking off the 
Lions, who have maintained con-
trol over the WWPA ranks. 
UCSD fell only two goals short 
in last season5 8-6 tide match 
and made it tough for the Lions 
before faltering in their March 6 
regular season match. This time, 
UCSD also had to deal with a 
raucous LMU home crowd. 

UCSD finishes the 2004 sea-
son at No.2 in the WWPA with 
a 15-20 record.

Tritons down 2-1 to Wildcats 
Baseball has trouble with Chico State 

By (GUIINEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

In its final home series of the 
2004 season, the UCSD baseball 
team took on California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
powerhouse Chico State April 23 
through April 25. The Tritons 
took the series opener, 5-4, after 
senior first baseman Keith 
Albrecht knocked the game-win-
ning home run in the bottom of 
the 10th inning. UCSD then 
proceeded to drop both ends of a 
doubleheader on April 24 by 
scores of 5-4 and 5-3, respective-
ly. 

The Tritons, now 18-17 in 
the CCAA and 29-21 overall, 
find themselves in a pressing 
position. Currently, they sit one 
game out of fifth place, behind 
San Francisco State University, 
with whom UCSD had been tied 
before the April 23 through 
April 25 competitions. In order 
to contend for a playoff berth, 
UCSD is in a must-win situation 
in game four against Chico State 

and throughout the April 30 
through May 2 series against Cal 
State Stanislaus. 

Albrecht lifted the Tritons to 
victory in the series opener 
against Chico State to cap off his 
stellar performance. Albrecht 
went 3-for-5 in the game with 
two runs scored and an RBI. His 
three hits included a pair of sin-
gles to opposite fields and the 
game-winning home run in the 
10th inning. 

Junior second baseman Ricky 
Pinocchio and junior designated 
hitter Joel Clark each went 3-for-
5 and scored a run for UCSD. 

The opening win snapped the 
Tritons' seven-game losing streak, 
stretching back to 2001, against 
the Wtldcats. 

In the doubleheader on April 
24, UCSD exploded in the first 
inning and went up, 3-1, over 
Chico State through three 
innings. The Wildcats then 
added two runs to tie the game at 
three runs apiece. 

Albrecht singled through the

Record--breaking days for Tritons 
Track and field demonstrates strength at Triton Invitational 

IIy MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men and women's 
track and field teams had a record-
breaking weekend at the Triton 
Invitational, standing out against 
the exceptionally competitive pool 
of teams invited for the two-day 
meet, including Olympic medalists 
and foreign elite athletes. 

The Tritons showcased their full 
array of abilities and, in the process, 
broke several school (eCOrds, some 
of which dated as far back as the 
1980s. 

"Numerous Olympic-level ath-
letes [competed], along with many 

~op Division I schools from across 
the nation," head coach Tony 
Salerno said "It was the most com-
petitive meet of the year." 

On April 24, the second day of 
the meet, the men's 1,600-meter 
relay team, consisting of sopho-
more Matt Borzage, freshman Dan 
Noel, sophomore Mike 
Cunningham and sophomore Matt 
Homer, smashed the former Triton 
school record in a time of 3 min-
utes, 15.07 seconds.
