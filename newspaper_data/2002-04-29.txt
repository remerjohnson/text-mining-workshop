Jack shreds RIMAe Arena 
Popular surf rocker makes return to UCSD 
By JOSH CROUSE 
News Editor 

UCS D's RIMAC Arena was 
tlIIed with a near-capacity crowd of 
concertgoers attending Jack 
Johnson 's April 26 show. 

Johnson, along with opener 
,\1ason Jennings, treated fans at 
the sold-out concert to more than 
two-and-a-half hours of soft, 
melodic music and even-toned 
Ivrics. 
. "The concert was so much more 

tha n I expected," said Earl Warren 
College junior Kay Kwok. "I like 
the way that RIMAC wasn 't totally 
packed. It made the entire experi-
ence so much more enjoyable." 

Mi nn esotan Mason Jennings 
opened with a sound that blended 
surf rock, country and traditional 
rock 'n ' roll. 

As the li ghts went o ut and 
Jennings took the stage, droves of 
fans poured from the seats down to 
the floor. 

"The best part was when the 
wave of people got 'p when Mason 
J ennings started," Kwok said. "It 
was like a herd of cattle, or pigs 
going to a trough." 

Jennings got a favorable recep-
tion from the crowd, though there

calming sounds: Jack Johnson (far right) plays his acoustic guitar while Merlo 
(left) plays bass and Adam Tupol keeps the beat on the drums. 
were some criticisms. 

"I like [Jennings'] style , though 
many of his songs sounded the 
same," said Revelle junior Laurel 
Johnson. 

Jack Johnson took the stage 
afrer a brief intermission to a stand-
ing ovation. 

"Jack Johnson looked hot in 

his usual casual attire ," Kwok 
said . 

The concert was something of a 
homecoming for Jack Johnson, 
who performed one of his first con-
certs in the Price Center in 
November of 2000.

Grad students still have Sun God 
Proposal would have made grad students pay for concert 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Efforts to foster better communi-
cation and awareness about the 
inequity between undergraduate and 
graduate registration fees toward 
Sun God are underway, according to 
A.S. President Jeff Dodge. 

"This is not really such a big 
deal," Dodge said . "We've just had 
some communication issues." 

T he issue sprung from the 
recent passage of the Athletics Fee 
Referendum, under which graduate 
sttldents, unlike undergraduate stu-
dents, will not need to pay $28.25 
per quarter. 

According to Muir Junior 
Senator Nick Lieberknecht, he and 
other A.S. Council members first 
wanted to deal with the issue of 
why graduate students do not pay 
for Sun God and other events on 
campus. After the GSA decided not 
to be included in the athletic fee 
charge designated by the referen-

dum, he and other A.S. Council 
members decided to create legisla-
tion that would address other fee 
inequities between undergraduate 
and graduate students. 

Last Wednesday, its authors 
withdrew this legislation, titled 
"The Free Rider Problem," in 
order to improve upon it. 

"We also didn't want to torpedo 
[the new A.S. Council 's] relations 
with the GSA," Lieberknecht said. 
" Both sides are trying to work at it." 

Dodge echoed this sentiment. 
"It is not by any means a spiteful 

way to get back the GSA," Dodge 
said. "We were discussing student 
fees in relation to athletic fees ." 

Both the GSA and the A.S. 
Council agree that the issue is com-
plicated and that more research is 
needed in order to properly address 
it. 

Among the most problematic 
issues is the fact tha t there is no 
current data on how many graduate 
students actually attend events such

as Sun God. 
GSA president Catherine 

Salsman acknowledged this problem. 
"It has recently come to our 

attention that the people at the 
door of such events as Sun God do 
not discriminate between graduate 
and undergraduate when checking 
for student IDs, " she said . 
"Unfortunately neither the A.S . 
nor the GSA has any real idea of 
how many graduate students may 
be attending these events." 

Salsman added that anecdotal 
surveys of GSA representatives 
suggest that the graduate turnout is 
likely quite low. In fact, it is low 
enough that representatives from 
the A.S. Council decided that it is 
not worth trying to police the situ-
ation at this year 's fcsoval. 

Graduate students such as Jesse 
Mills are also unsure of how many 
attend.

Tensions mount 
between ideologies 
Muslim students argue with 
Jewish protesters to MSA speech 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Tension between certam 
Muslim and Jewish students on 
campus heated up Wednesday 
night at a M uslim tudent 
Association event concerning the 
policies of Israeli Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon, according to guest 
lecturer Hatem Bazian from UC 
Berkeley. 

During the meeting, a group 
of students from the San Diego 
Israel Public Affai rs Committee, 
a Jewish pol itical group on cam-
pus, posted flyers outside Center 
Hall where the group was meet-
ing. T he flyers read, "Hatem 
Baziam: Jew-Hater? You decide." 

The flyers also had a quote 
from Bazian as quoted by Steven 
Emmerson in his book 
"American Jihad." Excerpts from 
the quote read, "'In the Hidith, 
the Day of Judgment will never 
happen until you fight the J ews 
... and the stones will say, 'Oh 
Muslim, there is a Jew hiding 
behind me. Come and kill him!'" 

Following the posting of the 
flyers , several students from the 
MSA began to tear them down. 
The students from SANDIPAC 
continued posting and eventually 
left the premises after throwing 
their remaining flyers on the 
ground, according to N elly 
Salem, a junior and member of 
the MSA,. 

After the event, students from 
the MSA expressed their concern 
and offense over the posted fly-
ers. Salem explained her account 
of the occurrence. 

"I came outside Jnd there \\ .1S 
a hundred of the tlver\ on the 
floor. T hey were prcadlllg thelll 
li ke confetti," Salem said. "I Jld, 
'You 're preading hate. '" 

President of SANDIP,\ C ,11111 
John MUIr College ell lor "hiLl 
Landu defended EmmCNHl. 

"It's not tha t Emmcr~()n I~ 
ano-Arab," Landu SJlt!. "I Ie I~ 
very familiar \\ ith Arab !!roup~ 
withll1 the nlted State~. \\ 11cn 
he talks of Muslim leadcr~ Il'~ not 
as if he doesn 't know what he's 
talking about. " 

Another member of the ,\IS,\ 
saw the flyers as a disruption of 
campus unity. MSA PreSlllcnt 
Ahmed Salem expressed frustra-
tion. 

"What happened Wednesday 
night was just inappropriate," 
Salem said. "There is no reason for 
personal attacks or posting flyer 
that attack a certain person or 
organization. Certain people that 
were complaining about someone 
putting up fl yers against them have 
done the exact same thing." 

La nd u bel ieved that their 
method was the only one accept-
able given the circumstances. 

"Jewish students know before 
they go into this MSA meeting 
that any questions that we ask will 
just turn into an opportunity for 
him to spew his rhetoric," Landu 
said. "And so we fel t that the only 
way to make people question 
what they hear was to question 
the credibility of the speaker." 

Landu said that shldents in 
SANDIPAC posted fl yers earlier

Samaritans 
bring help 
to Mexico 
Group runs a free 
medical clinic in 
Ensanada 
By DANIEL WATTS 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Chapter of the 
Palomar/San Diego Flying 
Samaritans drove to Mexico on 
Sarurday, teaming up with honor soci-
ety Alpha Epsilon Delta and four doc-
tors to provide: free medical care to 
people in need in the town of 
Ensenada. 

T he clinic is run every weekend, 
alternately by the Flying Samaritans 
and AED, but this weekend was 
unique because rarely do more than 
twO doctors fly down to help. The 
cli nic was also scheduled to open 
Sunday to accommodate the greater 
number of patients that four doctors 
could handle. 

The doctors' plane landed on the 
sma ll Ensenad~. airstrip Saturday 
morning, having flown from the San 
Francisco Bay Area earlier in the day. 
They make the trip to Ensenada twice 
a year. 

The doctors set uf> shop in the 
clinic just past noon. A crowd of more 
than 70 people had gathered outside, 
waiting to receive medical care. 

"Doctors work from 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m. or 5 p.m. without stopping to 
eat because there are so many 
patients. [The patients] will wait in 
lines for us, in the rain and cold, to 
see a doctor, n said Flying Sams sec-
retary and historian Elizabeth 
Stephens. 

Children played catch outside or 
colored in coloring boolcs provided by 
the Flying Samaritans while their par-
ents waited on benches to see the doc-
tors. A toy give;\way in a nearby park 
also provided entertainment for some 
children. 

This was the first time AED and the 
Flying Samaritans had worked in the 
clinic together. The 16 AED and Flying 
Samaritans volunteers interviewed 
patients, took their blood pressure and 
recorded their medical histories. 

Many volunteers were fluent in 
Spanish as well as English, speaking 
with the patients in their native lan-
guage and helping to translate for the 
doctors. 

The majority of the patients are 
Mexican nationals, but some, such as 
Pedro Luna, were U.S. citizens living 
in Ensenada. 

Luna has a venous malformation 
of the brain: a life-threatening condi-
tion in which a brain blood vessel 
becomes swollen with blood, inhibit-
ing some brain activity and becoming 
likely to rupture. Luna has been grad-
ually losing the ability to control the 
left side of his body. 

No treatment could be given at the 
clinic for Luna's condition, according 
to Paul Pitlyk, a neurologist at the 
clinic. As a U.S. citizen, Luna was eli-
gible for free treatment under 
MediCAL, but he was turned down 
when he applied. Pidyk wrote a letter 
to MediCAL explaining the serious-
ness of Luna's condition, hoping that 
a letter from an American doctor 
would push the organization toward 
accepting Luna. 

Most treatments at the weekend 
clinic consisted of distributing medi-
cine and advice. The medicine and 
other supplies are donated by hospitals 
such as UCSDs Thornton Hospital. 
San Jose Clinic, a private clinic down 
the street from the Flying Samaritans 
in Ensenada, has made its surgery 
facilities available once a month to the 
Flying Samaritans free of charge. 

~These patients can't possibly 
afford the San Jose Clinic," Stephens 
said, noting its amenities of air condi-

Scripps, World Wildlife Fund to join forces 
The Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the 

Wond Wildlife Fund have agreed to participate in the 
'Partnership of Sea Change: a combined effort to 
preserve marine life. The 1 D-year program will lobby 
for stronger ocean conselVation policy while employ-
ing cutting-edge science to create new conservation 
solutions. 

Funding for Scripps-WNF scholarships and train-
ing programs are also part of the project. One such 
academic opportunity IS a degree program offered 
through the Scripps Center for Marine Biodiversity 
and Conversation where students will work with 
Scripps and WNF staff to leam about the theoretical 
and real world aspects of conservation work. 

The ·Partnership of Sea Change· between 
Scripps and WNF represents the collaboration of 
elites in both the research and wildlife conservation 
fields. Scripps scientists are among the leading devel-
opers of ocean conselVation designs, and WWF is 
actively sponsoring more marine preselVation pro-
jects than any other organization in the worid. 

Ginkgo biloba found to 
preserve cognitive abilities 

UCSD School of Medicine neuroscientists have 
released a study showing that ginkgo biloba, an over-
the-counter herbal remedy, works to inhibit the cog-
nitive decline of people suffering from multiple scle-
rosis. 

Researchers drew condusions from a six-month 
study in which they compared neuropsychol~1 
test scores between patients with mild multiple 
sclerosis who were given ginkgo biloba and a con-
trol group in which partiapants were given a place-
bo. 

Of the 300,000 M.S. patients in the United 
States, cognitive problems involving concentration, 
menlOI'f and reasoning arise in aboUt 50 percent of 
the cases. According to J~corey-Bioom, the 
study's principal investigator, dal doses of 240 mil-
ligrams of the heIb may aid ml M.S. sufferers in 
memory, attention and functionins. 

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic alness that attacks 
the central neMltJS system, often disabling the 
patient physically and mentally. The UCSD study is 
the first to seek out any relationship between M.S. 
and ginkgo biloba, YAlich has also been shown to 
slow mental deterioration of Alzheimer's disease 
patients.

Study: En~e impedes 
childhood muscular dystrophy 

UCSD School of Medicine researchers have 
found that muscle decay related to childhood mus· 
cular dystrophy is deterred in mice when supple-
mented with naturally occurring enzyme. 

After researchers added an enzyme called CT 
GalNAc transferase to the skeletal muscle of 
mice, the muscle wasting associated with 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, was 
brought to a standstill. Normally the enzyme 
occurs where muscle fibers receive nerve impuls· 
es. However, the UCSD team was able to relocate 
CTGalNAc transferase to the DMD·sensitive mus· 
c1e area. 

Paul Martin, the project's senior author and an 
associate professor of neuroscience, envisions the 
eventual use of the enzyme in treatment for DMD; 
much like the way insulin is administered regularly to 
manage diabetes. 

CaUsed by a mutation in a muscle fiber protein 
called dystrophin, DMD affects one in 5,000 chil· 
dren, and occurs almost excIu~ in boys before 
they reach the age of six. The disease often leaves its 
sufferers in wheelchairs by age 12 and most DMD 
children die by their early twenties. 

The study appeared in the April 16 issue of 
Proceedings of . the Nationaf Academy of 
Sdences.

Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 is, if 
you think about it, quite simple: It's not 
child pornography if it doesn't involve 
children. Or, to put it in another way: A 
20-year-old woman with a body that looks 
like that of a 13 -year-old is sti ll an adult 
and has the right, if she so wishes, to have 
pornographic pictures of herself taken and 
distributed. (DCi't"lltcuSe Itle of d$m;;A 
20-year-old man has exa£tIY . the: same 
right.) 

The majority opinion. Qf the · CO\,1rt 
makes it quite clear that the pre-existing 
law exceeded any r~onable bounl:taries. 
"For instance, the literal terms of the 
statute embrace a Renaissance p)inting 
depicting a scene from classical mythology 
... these images do not involve, let alone 
harm, any child ren in the production 
process." Moreover, the opinion states, 
"1 he CPPA applies to a picture in a psy-
chology manual, as well as to a movie 
depicting the horrors of sexu~l abuse." 

The harsh penalties that the law pre-
scribed are also criticized: "With t1lese 
severe penalties in force, few legitimate 
movie producers or book publishers, or 
few other speakers in an y capacity, would 
rISk dislributing images in or near the 
uncerta in reach of the law." The law, in 
other words, was designed with a scare 
tactic in mind; its uncertain boundaries

and harsh penalties would inhibit speech 
well beyond its literal reach. 

T he Supreme Court found very little 
ground for such a broad prohibition, to 
the point that even the dissenting opinion 
of notoriously conservative Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist recognizes the need to 
"construe the CPPA." 

While it is not surprising that the 
Supreme Court decided to strike down 
the law, it is more surprising that such a 
bill could be passed ro begin with and that 
the decision of the court should provoke 
the contr .~ ·that it did. Two aspects

ro the poim in which what we used ro call 
reality is but a mirror of the image world. 
A world in which, for instance, images do 
not register the existence of celebrities, 
but create them. 

The CPPA is a sign of an imperfect 
transition between a culture of referents 
and one of images. \¥hile the law recog-
nizes the complex universe of images and

Reactionary parents 
perpetuate ignorance 
The cancellation of a lecture on 
Islam fosters narrow-mindedness 
By JESSICA LlNC;EL 
Staff Writer 

Like most 12 -year-olds, my sister 
Anna is pretty impressionable. Being 
seven years older, I have an undeni-
able presence in her life as a big sister, 
which manifests itself in a variety of 
amusing ways. I'll never forget the 
day she came home in a huff, plopped 
on the couch, heaved a sigh, and with 
an appropriately emphatic eye roll, 
dramatically muttered in her high-
pitched, fifth-grade voice, "Tyler is 
such a chauvinist pig!" 

Sometimes imitation really is the 
highest form of flanery. 

But even though I may have a cer-
tain sway over my beloved little pre-
adolescen t sister, there are other 
influences that come up in the day-to-
day life of a middle-schooler that are 
slowly but surely wedging their way 
into Anna's head. Of course, the 
biggest impact on Anna's mindset is 
the same one that first encouraged me 
to be an individual, to think for 
myself, 10 be wary of the masses: my 
parents. 

Parents have a huge impact on 
their children, more so than any other 
entity. Regardless of which side of the 
"nature versus nurture" argument 
you choose to defend as the precursor 
of a child's behavior, parents are usu-
ally to blame. They more or less 
detemline the religious beliefs, politi-
cal persuasions, eating habits, sleep-
ing patterns and social behavior of 
their offspring almost uninterrupted-
ly throughou t adolescence. 

Thats why I was so heartbroken 

and disnlrbed to hear about the can-
cellation of an assembly on Islamic 
culture at Annas middle school due to 
the insistence of a handful of angry 
and incredibly ignorant parents. 

Halmid Havani, the director of 
Muslim affairs for the University of 
California, was scheduled to come to 
my sister's school and speak about 
Muslim culture. It was exactly what 
needed to happen: basic education 
about a different culture for a bunch 
of middle school students ",ho need-
ed to learn . 

The first warning sign was the fact 
that students had to have a signed 
permission slip to attend the assem-
bly. That alone made me mad. This 
isn't sex education, and it's not dan-
gerous, violent, distasteful or scan-
dalous. This is knowledge, pure and 
simple. It's why we send our children 
to school in the first place. It's the 
basis of education - giving someone 
the chance to learn. 

But the fun didn't stop there. In 
one of the most disgusting portrayals 
of perpetuating narrow-mindedness 
that I've ever seen, a group of parents 
got together, protested the assembly, 
and the entire thing was cancelled. 
The main mystery for me is exactly 
how an entire group of adults man-
aged to convince themselves, let alone 
anyone else, that any harm could 
come from Havani's lecture. I simply 
can't wrap my mind around just how 
ignorant someone would have to be 
to consider this assembly something 
that needed to be stopped. This isn't

tries to correct the primacy of the 
image by extending the significa-
tion relation to nonexistent refer-
ents - that is, by creating virtual 
refere nts, with the same legal 
protection of the real ones. 

This is, quite frankly, a step 
into madness. The Supreme 
Court correctly argued that even 
in a society of images, the law 
must recognize the difference 
between being and appearing. 

The second aspect is [he 
political attempt to legislate 
morality - the act was passed in 
1996, at the time of the infamous 
"Contract with America" by one 
of the most Iiberticidal (the neol-
ogism is well-deserved) congress-
es of the century.

as the case is now known, should

I agree with the Supreme 

reduced th e importance of its 
true victims: the children. If 
laws against child pornography 
are designed to protect children 
for only this purpose , then the 
moral status of a man who gets 
excited looking at children 's pic-
tures must not interest us . You 
and I might think that the man 
needs serious medical attention, 
but as long as no minors are 
involved, this is no concern for 
the law. 

If, on the other hand, the 
mere image of what appears to 
be a minor is punishable, then 
what we are punishing is the 
morality of using such depic-
tions. But on one hand, as the 
Supreme Court opined, "It is ' .. 
well-established that speech may 
not be prohibited because it 
concerns subjects offending our 
sensibilities." On the other 
hand, by focusing on the 
immoral nature of the conduct, 
the law diverts attention from 
the essen tial element: the pro-
tection of the children. 

Child pornography is an 

Court's argument against the gov-
ernment that "the argument that 
virtual child pornography whets 
pedophiles' appetites and encour-
ages them to engage in illegal con-
duct is unavailing because the 
mere tendency of speech to 
encourage W1Ia wfuI acts is not a 
sufficient reason for banning it." 

Blit there is much more at 
hand than someone's right to 
express himself through words. 
We are in a fight against the 
unnatural portrayal of children as 
sexually mature and sexually 
desirable parmers, because they 
are not. Even in less e.xplicit por-
traya ls, pedophiles can build 
upon the sexual innuendo that 
exists in such depictions. 

There is no question in my 
mind that depicting minors

The onl y way ,yn thetit:

by showing that the presence and

increase the demartd and the pro-

COllrt found thar "the govern-
ment has hown no 1I10re lh:1Il a 
remote connection between 
speech tha t might entourage 
thoughts or impul ses and any 
resulting child abuse." 

Short of this Justification, a 
law that punishes the possession 
of pornographic images for thclr 
effec ts on adult ind ivi dua ls, 
rather than for the in volvement 
of minors, is an attempt 10 regu-
late thought and morality, and 
has no place in our Jllfispru-

and Illotivation of pedophiles. It 
is hard to get anyone to go back 
to innocence once the fi res of

much less someone with "

Ediror: 

J would like to clear up a few 
points that were made in the edi-
torial printed on Apri l 18. T he 
arti cle accuses me of having "a 
blatan t conflict of interest" by 
wanting to hold my position as 
"p rogram manager" at KSD1~ 
even if I lVere elected as the com-
missioner of programming. 

\-\'hat bothered me about this 
sta tement was that the A.S . 
Programming Office and KSDT 
have no affilia tion . The A.S. pro-
grammer does not deal with fund-
ing for KSDT or anything else 
that would be a conflict of interest 
with KSDT. 

The argument that was made 
in the editorial states that anyone 
involved with student govern-
ment should not be involved with 
any other student organization 
funded by the A.S. Council 
because it is a conflict of interest, 
even if the office one holds does 
not directly deal with the organi-

~ation they are a part of. This 
doesn't make any sense to me. 

Second, there is no "program 
manager" position at KSDT. The 
position that I hold is promotions 
director, which does not even deal 
with anv of the A.S. Council-
related aspects of KSDT. I wish 
that the editorial staff would know

Thank you so much for your 

excellent coverage of the 
Palestinian fund-raiser held at 
UCSD on April 20. 

Unfortunately, one important 
detail was left out. While over 
5100,000 was raised at this event, 
it was not mentioned that 4 per-
cen t of all funds raised were to be 
seized by the UC Regents. 

This profiteering off funds 
earmarked for humanitarian relief 
is appalling and morally repug-
nant. This money was intended to 
fund food assistance for destitute 
Palestinians, equipment for hospi-
tals, care for traumatized children 
and more. 

It is disgusting that $4,000 of 
these funds will now be spent in a

Students 
learn to love 
for the week 
Hate-Free 
Campus Week 
preaches harmony 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

As part of a five-day program 
designed to help eliminate all types 
of hatreds and biases, students 
called each other "bitches" many 
times over, stomped on literature 
and learned how to love. 

One event that highlighted 
Hate-Free Campus Week was 
UCSD graduate and artist-in-resi -
dence Viviana Lombrozo's art 
installation tiued "Taking a Stand." 
The exhibit, which allowed visitors 
to view Holocaust-related art while 
stomping on hate-inciting litera-
ture, honored those who aided Jews 
during the Holocaust. 

Organized by the Student 
Office of Human Relations, the 
week also featured a lecture by cul-
tural speaker Gregorio Luke called 
"The Art of Love." Luke educated 
an 80-person audience about the 
merits of various types of love. 

SOHR Director Elizabeth 
Urtecho felt that Luke helped stu-
dents see the merit~ of love as a 
substitute for hate. 

"You have the power to love and 
the power to hate. Love is an alter-
native to hate," she said. 

The Kaibigang Pilipino, Asian 
Pacific Islander Student Association 
and the African American Student 
Union added an anti -racism ele-
ment to the week's activites by 
staffing tables on Library Walk. 

A performance by the SOHR 
Troupe rounded out the program~ 
set of major events. The interna-
tionally recognized street theater 
group, which recenuy recieved an 
invitation to travel to Hong Kong, 
engaged students dining at Revelle 

College~ Plaza Cafe in a broad com-
edy skit titled "Bitch Skit," which 
addressed the dangers of using 
offensive words such as "bitch" in 
seemingly benign contexts. 

The performance, while gener-
ally well-received, did cause a little 
bit of controversy. 

"One of the staff members at 
Revelle came up to us and said that 
he found [the skit) incredibly offen-
sive," said SOHR Assistant Director 
Richard del Castillo. "The group 
doesn't sugarcoat the message." 

SOHR began its 2002 Hate-Free 
Campus Campaign, of which last 

week~ events were a part, in reaction 
to several on-campus crimes alleged-
ly motivated by racism, homophobia 
and other fonns of hatred. In one 
instance, a homosexual student 
found a flier advocating the murder 
of all homosexuals. In another, an 
African-American freshman received 
several calls, allegedly from friends 
of the Aryan Nation, who threatened 
her life and told her that "niggers" 
do not belong in La Jolla. 

While most of SOHR's major 
events went off without a hitch, the 
office did suffer some major set-
backs. Wednesday, the program's 
most densely scheduled day, was 
almost entirely rained out. Friday 
morning's Bomani Dance & Drum 
Ensemble performance also fell 
victim to the poor weather. Finally, 
not a single student showed up for 
for the film, "Journey to a Hate 
Free Millineum" presented by 
Nancy Tubbs, the director of UC 
Riverside's Lesbian, Gay, Bisaua[, 
Transgender Resource Office. 

Last week's conflict between 
Muslim and Jewish student groups 
served as a distraction from the 
program's hate-free message. 
Urtecho, however, was undeterred. 

"I think that we did pretty good 
under all circumstances," she said. 
"I mean, there is a war. There are a 
lot of emotions out there."

Many people saw the

Continued from page 1 
that morning but the flyers were 
all torn down. The students came 
to Landu . Landu encouraged 
them to place the flyers at the 
meeting so that those in atten-
dance could hear their opinions. 

Another MSA student, Amir 
Fahid, saw the flyers as a disrup-
tion of campus unity. 

"One of the members of the 
club that was here wrote an article 
in the [opinion] section of the 
GUJlrdian saying that our presi-
dent does not want [0 cooperate 
with other clubs," Fahid said, 
"while this guy is passing out fly-
ers that call us Jew-haters." 

Fahid was referring to a letter 
to the editor in the Guardian, 
published on April 22 and sub-
mitted by Union of Jewish 
Students member and head of the 
Unified Campus Coalition Brian 
Brook. Although Brook denied 
involvement in the creation or 
distributing of the flyers, he 
defended the actions of those who 
did the posting. 

Brook said that he had been

Continued from page 2 
tioning and tile floors. 

The Flying Samaritans' clinic 
consisted of an old building loaned 
to the students after negotiations 
with the Mexican governmental 
organization DIF, similar to the 
American Red Cross . Emma 
Lencioni, a local Ensenada woman 
and wife of former Mexican 
President Arnoldo Aleman's air-
plane pilot, helped get the clinic 
building for the Flying Samaritans. 

Before the Flying Samaritans 
established the Ensenada clinic, 
Lencioni had shuttled patients 
from Ensenada to the Flying 
Samaritarts' clinic in Tecate. Some 
of the patients had no means of 
transportation and could not afford 
the bus ride to Tecate. 

Lencioni collaborates with a 
Guadalajaran woman named 
Maridena, who runs seminars at 
the clinic during the weelc, teaching 
local residents basic skills such as 
sewing. 

Funding for the clinic is done pri-
marilyon the U.S. side of the border. 
While the Flying Samaritans is a

attempting with· cofounder of the 
UCC Nema Milaninia to bring 
unity between Muslim and Jewish 
students on campus. Brook saw the 
MSA events during the week tiued 
"From Liberation to Oppression" 
as divisive of campus unity. 

"How are they promoting 
unity by bringing such a person 
here?" Brook said. 

Brook cited Israel Week as an 
attempt at unity. 

"Israel Week was about hope 
for the future in the Middle 
East," Brook said . "This week, by 
contrast, was about assigning 
blame, spreading lies and half-
truths and fostering an environ-
ment where students feel 
attacked . I don't thinle there is 
anything this year that has con-
tributed more to the disruption of 
unity on campus." 

Although there was controver-
sy surrounding the night, many 
see the dialogue as healthy. 

Nicholas Aguilar, UCSD 
director of student .poJicies and 
judicial affairs, was at the meeting 
and praised the night'S events. 

"This event was well-done," 
Aguilar said. "It presented infor-
mation that was obviously con-
troversial, but it was well in the 
bounds of acceptable discourse at 
UCSD." 

not receive A.S. Council funding 
because most of its activities take 
place off campus. 

"We basically raise our own 
money. We just organized a ban-
quet at the Doublelree hotel in 
Mission Valley and got items donat-
ed to have a silent auction," said 
clinic coordinator Kranti Gallapudi. 

The banquet raised over 53,000, 
all of which went directly to the 
clinic, she said. 

Though the focus is on the 
patients, the students cherish the 
opportunity provided by the clinic, 
according to Gallapudi. 

"Every time I come down here, 
I realize this is why I want to be a 
doctor," Gallapudi said. 

Around 40 members sign up for 
each weekend clinic, while there 
are only half that many spots avail-
able. The clinic coordinator 
decides who gets to go to Ensenada 
based on their participation in the 
club's u.S.-based activities, such as 
fund-raising. Priority is also given 
to Spanish speakers. 

"We get an idea of what the 
world is like outside the United 
States and other wealthy countries 
where everyone has some sort of 
health insurance," said club 
President Joy Hardison. "\-\'hen I 
become a doctor, I need to dedicate 
part of my life to charity work. It's by 
random chance that people like us 
have this wealth, this opportunity." 

Jack: 
Ben Harper joined 
Johnson on stage 
Continued from page 1 

"['m so glad to be back here in 
San Diego," Jack Johnson said 
after playing two songs. 

Jack Johnson covered most of 
the material from his debut 
album, "Brushfire Fairytales." He 
also played some previously unre-
leased songs and covered songs by 
G -Love and Special Sauce and 
Sublime. 

The band left the stage after 
only about 40 minutes of play, but 
soon returned with Jack Johnson 
announcing, "I was just kidding, 
San Diego. That was way too 
short." 

He then played a few more 
songs before inviting Jennings to 
the stage to play three songs. 

The concert marked the sec-
ond time in the last year that 
Johnson has played at UCSD. He 
previously opened for Ben 
Harper on May 30, 2001, in a 
show that also included Jurassic 
5. 

In a surprise move, Harper 
joined Jack Johnson on stage for 
the last two songs of the encore.

Sweet melody: Jack Johnson sings a 
love song during one of his encore 
performances al Friday's concert. 

"There was a rumor that Ben 
Harper was going to show up, but 
I didn 't believe it, so when he did 
show up, I was totally excited," 
Kwok said. 

Overall, fans were pleased 
with the show. 

"I thought it was an awesome 
show and was especially pleased 
with the surprise appearance by 
Ben Harper," Laurel Johnson 
said. "Jack's great." 

Monitoring how many grad-
uate students attend the event is 
logistically impossible, accord-
ing to Dodge. As a result, this 
year's Sun God will go on as 
planned and graduate students 
will still not pay. 

Dodge said he hopes the 
incoming A.S. Council will con-
tinue to communicate with the 
GSA in addressing the issue. [n 
the mean time, talks of creating 
a taskforce to analyze graduate 
student participation in pro-

Although the issue is unre-

F RODEO GLORY 
T he rowdy cowboys and old-fashioned fun of the old West may seem a world away from the quiet libraries and scientific research of UCSD, but last weekend, a real live rodeo wasn't far away. 

The 38th Annual Lakeside Rodeo drew dozens of pJlrticipants and 
thousands of spectators to San Diego's East County April 26-28. Event such 
as calf roping, steer wrestling, barrel racing, bull riding and the bareback bronc 
pitted man - and woman - against beast, or called for a rider to place great 
truSt in his or her horse. 

The action at a rodeo can be heart-stopping and the images unforgettable .

SPEAKING 
OUT AGAINST 
HATRED 

The members of the Office of Religious 
Mfairs were appalled to discover that a hate 

incident against the Jewish community 
occurred at UCSD two weeks ago. 

As representatives of four religious 
traditions and as individuals who are 

committed to working together towards a 
peaceful, diverse, tolerant world, we call for 

a stronger commitment to strengthening 
our recognition of our common humanity. 

We also call for greater moral courage 
among the entire TJ niversity community to 
stand up against hatred and to grant it no 

haven on our campus.

Three on the way into office 
More A.S. Council members-elect sit in the hot seat 
By LINDSAY BOYD 
Associate Features Editor 

Steve Klass 
Vice President External Steve Klass is an unlikely 

politician. 
"Acrually, I've been against school politics for a 

while," Klass said . "Not so much against it, but just not 
involved." 

His attirude changed after a one-year hiarus from 
UCSD. When he rerurned, Klass became involved in 
several grollPS. 

"When I came back, I started getting involved in a 
number of groups," Klass said. "Mainly centering 
around the Cross Culrural Center and my ethnic srud-
ies major." 

Klass lobbied the UC Regents and met with other 
UC schools about pressing issues. He was approached 
to become the national affairs director in the A.S. 
External office. 

"The job enllliled meeting on a national level [with 
other UC schools) to IlIlk about what we need to lobby 
our senators and congressmen for," Klass said. "1 was a 
represenllltive - I would bring what UCSD~ issues 
were." 

Those issues included parking and access to cam-
pus. Through working in the external office, Klass was 
asked to run for vice president external on the Students 
First ticket. 

Klass would like to see better communication 
between srudents and their elected represenllltives. 

"What will happen will be a greater use of the 
information we get from these national and state-
wide meetings," Klass said. "We'll bring that back 
and make sure srudents can use it here on campus." 

While Klass has had political success on campus, 
politics are not his calling. 

"I'd like to be a teacher," Klass said. "I'd like to be a 
university professor, but making sure that it stays real . 
Making sure that people actually gain from what hap-
pens." 

David Mitchell 
Our new commissioner of diversity is JUSt a wee 

freshman . However, David Mitchell is already trying [0 
make a difference at UCSD. 

"I basically thought I could effect some sort of 
change," Mitchell said . "Maybe through this position I 
could really provide support for srudent organizations, 
help out with community outreach and improve the 
climate here on campus." 

While diversity is a hot topic on campus right now, 
it's up [0 Mitchell and others in his office to make sure 
that diversity is not just a buzz word, but a reality. 

"Diversity is two things," Mitchell said. "Diversity, 
meaning a variety of people from different culrures and 
backgrounds. It's also a diverse amount of ideas."

Mitchell says tha t those two areas are what he will 
be focusing on in the coming year. He says that having 
more open discussions and events, as well as publiciz-
ing those events, can improve diversity on campus. 

While Mitchell 's office can impact diversity, he 
admits that the administration also has a big role. 
There is a currently a diversity council where anyone 
can voice their opinion . 

Mitchell said these types of forums are crucial. 
"Perhaps more forums like that between the faculty 

and the administration and the students especially will 
improve diversity on campus," Mitchell said. 

While Mitchell, a Thurgood Marshall biology 
major, came to UCSD thinking about medical school, 
politics and public service have lately been calling his 
name. Thus, like many of us, Mitchell is not quite sure 
where he 'll end up. 

But being a freshman , he ha s plenty of time to thinlc 
about it. 

Robin Shelton 
Commissioner of athletics Robin Shelton is one of 

the few srudents elected to A.S . Council who did not 
run on the Srudents First slate. 

"It took me a while to decide that I was going to run 
as an independent candidate," Shelton said. "So I thinlc 
that some of the slates saw it as something that would 
not detract from their individual slate if r was not run-
ning with anybody else." 

Commissioner of athletics is a new position that was 
created this year. Shelton was promoted from his pre-
vious role on A.S. Council, head of the task force on 
athletics, to fill the position. When it came time for 
elections, it was clear that Shelton was the only person 
for the job. Literally. He ran unopposed. 

"I was pretty surprised when I found out that I was 
running unopposed," Shelton said. "This new position 
is one with a lot of potential, and I am excited to be 
able to do it again for another year." 

Like most of this year's commissioners, Shelton had 
not always been interested in srudent government. 

"I have always enjoyed the political arena, but r 
never had any strong intentions to be part of A.S. at 
UCSD," Shelton said . "The commissioner of athletics 
position was created and it was a narural fit for me." 

While some consider UCSD to be without a 
notable athletics program, Shelton said this is a short-
loming of the srudent body, not the athletics depart-
ment. 

"1 don't think that UCSD athletics is lacking any-
thing," Shelton said. "We have great players, tremen-
dous coaches, wonderful teams and a great administra-
tive staff." 

Shelton said that athletics can provide Tritons with 
a sense of unity and school spirit. "I feci that the gen-
eral campus community lacks a sense of spirit and a 
unifying force that brings e eryone together." Shelton 
said. "I think that athletics can fill this void and help to 
round out the college experience."

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Tritons lose in extra innings 
Vanguard University overcomes -UCSD 6-5 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

After a strong series last week-
end against Cal State Stanislaus, 
UCS D took to the road to face 
Vanguard U niversity on Thursday 
in a nOl1conference match-up. 

Combined, the Tritons and the 
Lions put up 22 hits and 11 total 
runs in the game. Vanguard came 
ou t on top, however, after pushing 
across its sixth run and game-win-
ner in the bouom of the lOth 
inning to ea rn the 6-5 victory. 

After Trito n pitcher Keith 
Smith hit Lion catcher Curt 
Ga rner and right fielder Samuel 
Baeder in the bOrlom of the second, 
Vanguard third baseman Andy 
Freeman reached on a fielder's 
choice. Garner then cro sed the 
plate on an error by UCSD short-
stop Keith Hernandez. 

The Tritons struck back in the 
top of the fourth inning. After 
UCSD designated hitter Garret 
Riddle walked, right fielder Tyler 
Sullivan blasted a two-run home 
run off of Lion pi tcher Josh Franco 
to put the Tritons ahead by one. 

1 n the bottom of the fi fth, 
UCSD pitcher Alex Cremidan 
replaced Smith on the mound. 
Cremidan starred off on the wrong 
foot when Baeder greeted him with 
a single. Freeman then lai~ down a 
sac bunt to advance the runner into 
scoring position. Immediately after 
Cremidan hit Vanguard second 
baseman Sean Moglia with a pitch, 
Lion center fielder Michael Bair 
singled and scored Baeder on the 
play. Shortstop Matt Tisthnmmer 
continued the barrage and singled, 
while first baseman Chad Chop 
reached on a fielder's choice. Bair 
then scored on a wild pitch, as did 
Tisthammer. Vanguard scored 
three runs on three hi ts in the 
inning. 

But the Lion' big inning did

nice to see UCSD on the map, and 
this meet has done a lot to help that. 
I t's very gratifying to sit in the office 
and have USC call and Stanford call

not put a damper on the Tritons as 
they bounced back to put up three 
runs on four hits in the top of the 
sixth inning. UCSD catcher Jeff 
Riddle led off and singled, followed 
by a double by pinch hitter 
Anthony Lococo. Designated hitter 
Guret Riddle also doubled and 
scored Jeff Riddle and Lococo on 
the play. Vanguard pitcher Franco 
hit Sullivan with a pitch and was 
then replaced by reliever pitcher 
Bishop Griggs. UCSD shortstop 
Hernandez singled to left field and 
drove in Garret Riddle for the 
Tritons' third run of the inning. 

UCSD held the lead until the 
bottom of the eighth inning when 
Lion left fielder Joe Carnahan 
smacked a solo home run off of 
UCSD clo er Robert Peele to tie 
the game at five apiece. 

The Tri tons threa tencd at the 
tOP of the 10th when Sullivan and 
Garret Riddle got on base with one 
out. But UCSD was unable to con-

over, the Tritons look to the CCAA 
Championships at UCSD on May 
10 and May II, which will also be 
the team's last opportuni ty to quali-
fy any additional athletes for the 
NCAA Division II Championships 
in San Angelo, Texas at the end of 
the month. According to Salerno, 
the road to the conference title will 
probably go through the favorite, 
Division II juggernaut UC Davis, 
and also possibly Chico State 
University, which may give Davis a 
scare in the future. 

"We have just got to compete 

vert as the next two batters retired 
in order for the final two outs of the 
inning. 

Vanguard saw its opportunity to 
win and took advantage of it in the 
bottom of the 10th. 

Lions Chop and Carnahan sin-
gled followed by a single by desig-
nated hiuer Jason Searle. With the 
bases loaded, Vanguard's Garner 
hit a sacrifice fly to center field and 
scored Chop for the victory. 

Peele got the loss for the 
Tritons and falls to 0-3 while Chop 
earned the win for the Lions. 

For UCSD, first base'man Chad 
Addison, Jeff Riddle, Lococo and 
Sullivan all notched two hits apiece, 
while Garret Riddle went three-
for-four on the day. 

Vanguard's Chop, Carnahan and 
Searle also had two mocks apiece. 

UCSD falls to 26-21-1 overall 
with the loss and turns to face UC 
Davis this weekend in its last regu-
lar season series. 

and show that we can do that, with 
the level of talent we have," Salerno 
said. "Certainly when you look at 
the overall picture, some of the 
meets we've seen the past few weeks 
have told our kids that the Division 
II [National Championship) meet is 
really wi thin their level. Overall, the 
men s team is a little banged up, and 
we may struggle because of injuries. 
The women's team looks good 
overall - very balanced, lots of 
scorers. We're hoping things go 
well and we can be in the top three 
in the conference."

Track and Field 
Both the mens and women's 

track teams have been incredibly 
strong this year. The women's 
team in particular has excelled, 
winning a CCAA dual meet, the 
UCSD Collegiate Invitational and 
a second-place finish at the All-Ca.l 
championships with four Division 
I schools. The men finished sec-
ond in both the CCAA dual meet 
and the UCSD Collegiate 
Invitational with a fifth-place fin-
ish in the All-Cal and 22nd in the 
California-Nevada meet. 

However, in track and field,

in the women's 2001 NCM 
Championships. The CCM 
Championship will be the last 
opportunity for the Tritons to 
qualify athletes for the 2002 
NCAA Championships (to take 
place May 23 through May 25 at 
Angelo State University in San 
Angelo, Texas). 

Women's Crew 
2002 marks the first time the 

NCM has insti tuted a separate 
women's rowing championship 
- men's rowing does not fall 
under NCAA jurisdiction - for 
each division . Four regions will 
send one team and the CM 
will select one school at-large to 
compete in the inaugural com-
petition. 

The West is likely to receive 
two bids, with UCSD, UC Davis 
and vVestern Washington all show-
ing well throughout the year. In 
the latest rankings from the 
NCAA, UCSD is third with UC 
Davis first and Western 
Washington second. UCS D has 
three more events left in which to 
show the selection committee it 
deserves a spot in the finals. The 
2002 NCAA Rowing 
Championships will take place 
May 30 through J l!Ile 1 at Eagle 
Creek Reservoir in Indianapolis. 

than you, younger than you, a dif-
ferent nationality than you, it does-
n't matter. Their superficial differ-
ences aren't important, it's how 
they play the game thats impor-
tant. And the fact that you both are 
playing the same game, even if its 
on opposite sides, creates an 
understanding between you two. 

For example, our staff put 
together an intramural softball 
team and recently we played a 
team consisting of the UCSP 
men's volleyball tcani. While nat-
urally we are on the opposi te sides 
of the print, seeing them bumble, 
curse, taunt, joke, trash-ta lk and 
have fun out there alongside US 
made me realize we are all just out 
there to have fun. 

What this means for our soci-
ety, that the only time we can 
ignore our differences is in the 
midst of a meaningless ga llic, I 
don't mow. Maybe if the found-
ing fathers had played a li ttle 
more softball with their slaves 
they would have actually meant it 
when they wrote "All men arc 
created equal." Maybe it means 
every athlete should secede from 
the United States and form their 
own country, in which they just 
play sports all day and there 
wouldn't be any problems besides 
who was going to win and who 
was going to lose.

Sears Directors' race heats up 
UCSD drops in standings from fourth to eighth 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

Mter finishing the fall season in 
fourth place in the Sears Director's 
Cup standings, UCSD dropped to 
eighth place in the standings 
re leased at the conclusion of winter 
sports. 

The Sears Directors' Cup was 
developed by both the National 
Association of Collegiate 
Directors of Athletics and USA 
Today to recognize the top athletic 
programs in the nation. Standings 
are based on a college's national 
finish in up to 14 different sports: 
seven for men and seve n for 
women . Each national champion 
receives 100 points. 

Behind the strength of the 
women's soccer (100 points), 
womens volleyball (75 points) and 
men's cross country teams (41 
points), UCSD garnered 216 points 
in the fall - only 44 points behind 
first-place Western State College. 
Grand Valley State University (236 
points) and UC Davis (224.5 
points) finished second and third in 
the fall standings, respectively. 

However, the winter sporting 
season was a di fferent story for the 
Tritons. The 155 points earned by 
the women's fencing, men's swim-
ming and women's swimming 
teams weren't e nough to keep 
UCSD at the top, dropping it four 
spots to No. 8 in the nation. The 
winter standings include women's 
and men 's basketball, ice hockey, 
swimming, indoor track and field, 
fencing, rifle, snow skiing anc! 
men's wrestling. 

points by placing 13th in the 
NCAA finals. UCSD 's women's 
fencing team was the only other 
winter sport to compete in nation-
als, finishing 19th and earning 33 
points for UCSD. 

Western State continued to 
maintain its grip on the top spot in 
the rankings by scoring in men 's 
indoor track and field, men's 
wrestling, skiing and women's 
indoor track and field to push its 
total point score to 500. 

Jumping from sixth place to sec-
ond place was the University of 
North Dakota, which placed in 
women's basketball, men's swim-
ming, women's swimming, mens 
indoor track and field, and women 's 
indoor track and field to give it a 
total score of 476.5, only 24.5 
behind Western State. 

Truman State University moved 
up two spaces to occupy the No. 3 
position with a score of 470.6. It is 
followed by South Dakota State 
University in fourth place with 457 
points and Grand Valley State 
University in fifth with 423 points. 

UC Davis (403 .5) and Adams State 
College (377) round out the rest of 
the field ahead of UCSD. 

Sitting in eighth place with 371 
total points, UCSD is looking for 
points from the multiple spring 
sports teams that are seeking to 
make some noise in the playoffs. 

Looking at the standings of 
UCSD's California Collegiate 
Athletic Association rivals, 
California State University 
Bakersfield is in 14th place with 
265.5 points, and Cal Poly Pomona 
is the only other CCM team in the 
top 50 - occupying the 39th spot 
with 161.5 points. Cal State 
Dorninguel; Hills and Cal State San 
Bernardino are tied for 62nd, 
Chico is 73rd and CSU Los 
Angeles and Sonoma,State are tied 
for 81st to round out the CCM 
teams in the top 100 rankings. 

CSU Bakersfield and Cal Poly 
Pomona both won national cham-
pionshi ps in the winter sports sea-
son - Bakersfield in men's swim-
ming and Cal Poly Pomona in 
women 's basketball. 

The women's swimming team's 
fourth-place national finish provid-
ed 75 points for UCSD, while its 
male counterparts contributed 47

ber Ryan Gale, the Tritons fired a 
team total of 899 at the CCM 
Championships at Diablo Grande's 
Legends Course in Patterson, 
Calif. More importantly, Cal State 
San Bernardino fired a 905 and 
UCSD's placement over the 
Coyotes was enough to mathemat-
ically propel it to the regionals. 

There are 10 regions in NCAA 
Division II mens golf, with the win-
ner of each regional advmcing to the 
National Championship. 
Furthennore, eight at-large teams 
will be selected to participate with 
two-to-four of those bids expected to 
go to teams in the West. The top two 
individuals who are not on a team 
going to the nationals from each 
region will also advance to nationals. 

While the Tritons retain little 
hope of advancing unless they win 
the regional, Ryan Gale, who coach 
Mike Wydra called "one of the best 
players in Southern California" ear-
lier this year, has a distinct chance of 
making the 6naJ competition. Gale 
has the teams lowest competition 
average, won the Cal Lutheran 
Invitational earlier this year, and is 
coming off a one-ovcr 217 at the 
CCAA Championship. If the 
Tritons do get out of the Western 
Regional, they will take pan in the 
2002 NCAA Mens Golf 
Championships May 21 to May 24 
at Mission Inn Golf and Tennis 
Resort at Howey-in-the-Hills, Fla. 

Women's Tennis 
The UCSD womens tennis team 

has qualified for the 2002 NCAA 
Westnn Resional to be hosted next 
weekend at UCSD's own North 
Tennis Courts. The Tritons were 
chosen to host the regional OYer UC 
Davis. The Tritons split their two 
matches with Davis this season, but 
the Aggies' two losses to Cal Poly 

Pomona and UCSD's convincing 
victory over the Broncos was enough 
to give the nod to the Tritons. 

There are eight regions in 
Division II women's tennis, with two 
competitions in each region for the 
16 national championship spots. UC 
Davis, Grand Canyon and Hawaii-
Hilo nuke up the rest of the field for 
the UCSD-hosted portion of the 
Western Regional. The Tritons will 
take on Hawaii-HiIo, which is ranked 
No. 19 in the nation in the latest 
Intercollegiate Tennis Association 
poll, Friday at 2 p.m. in the first 
round, leaving No. 16 Davis to take 
on No. 18 Grand Canyon. The /inaI 
will take place Saturday at II a.m. If 
UCSD wins its bracket, the team will 
advance to the 2002 NCAA 
Women's Tennis Championships 
May 9 to May 12 at the Plaza Tennis 
Center in Kansas City, Mo. 
Men's Tennis 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
received a favorable draw in the 
2002 NCAA Western Regional, 
heading to Hawaii to take on 
Hawaii-Hilo and Hawaii Pacific. 

Six teams make the Western 
Regional competition with two 
teams advancing to the 16-team 
National Championship. UCSD 
will take on unranIced Hawaii-Hilo 
Friday, May 1. The winner of that 
match-up takes on IOth-ranlced 
Hawaii Pacific the next day, with 
the winner advancing to the 
National Championships. Of note, 
the Tritons ended up on the oppo-
site side of the draw of first-ranked 
Brigham Young University-Hawaii, 
something necessary to have a 
chance of qualifying for the 
National Championship. 

UCSD lost to Hawaii Pacific 1-6 
earlier this season, with the Tritons 
losing two three-set matt:hes that 
would have til ted the balance in 
favor of UCSD had they prevailed. 
Hawaii-Hilo enters the competition 
with a 12-12 record, Hawaii Pacific 
is 18-4 (with two losses to ranlced 
Division I teams and two losses to 
BYU-Hawaii) and the Thtons are 

18-3. The 2002 Men's Tennis 
Championships will take place May 
3 to May 5 at the Plaza Tennis 
Center in Kansas City, Mo. 

Softball 
The UCSD women's softball 

team opened the season 13 -1 and was 
20-7 on March 15; a spot in the 2002 
NCAA Western Regional seemed a 
forgone conclusion with the way the 
Tritons were playing. But since then, 
UCSD has gone 8-16 and is now 
four games out of the CCAA lead 
with only four games remaining. 

Now UCSD, ranked eighth in 
the latest NCAA Western Region 
ranlcings, is scrapping for one of the 
six spots in the Western Regional. 
The six entrants are detennined by a 
complicated NCAA power ranking. 

The Tritons are apparently com-
peting with Cal State Dominguez 
Hills and Cal State Bakersfield for 
the final spot, though nobody is 
incredibly sure of the unreleased 
power ranlcings. UCSD split two 
games with Balcersfield and won 
two of three against Dominguez 
Hills in the last two weeks. 

. The 2002 NCAA Western 
Regional will take place May 9 to 
May 12 at the home field of the 
highest-seeded team. The 2002 
NCAA Softball Championships are 
scheduled for May 16 through May 
20 in Salem, Va. 

Women's w.ter Polo 
The Triton women are searching 

for their first bid to the NCAA tour-
nament since moving to Division II 
last year and could achieve it with a 
Western Water Polo Association 
tide. UCSD was scheduled to take 
on Loyola Marymount University 
in the WWPA final Sunday after-
noon with results unavailable at 
press time. Earlier in the season, 
Loyola took down the Tritons in a 
4-2 defensive showdown at UCSD~ 
Canyonvicw Pool.

By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD track and fie ld held its 
own against a highly competitive 
field at the rwo-day UCS D Open 
on Friuay and Saturday, where his-
tory was maue wi th a new 
American record in the women 's 
discus. While they were at it, they 
rewrote a few of the school's 
record books in the team's fi nal 
mcet of the regular eason. 

The Tritons played host to over 
20 collegiate reams, including ful l 
~quads from Division I powerhous-
es U niver irv of Southern 
Cal ifornia and ' UCLA and repre-
sentatives from ' tanford University

set the tone for the meet. 

"[It wa J a grcat meet overall," 
head coach Tony Salerno said. "It 
was stunning. T he cal iber of com -
peotion was so high - well above 
what we're going to see at natio n-
als." 

Most eyes were on Olympian 
Suzy Powell, who threw herself 
into the spotl ight wirh an 
American-record 227 ' 10" in the 
wom en's discus, shattering the 
216' 1 0" mark previously set by 
Ca rol Cady in 1986. Powell , cur-
rently competing for Asics, bested 
her performance of 214'\0" earlicr 
this month, the best American 
performance this year until now. 

On the local front, Rob Ewanio 
made waves by improving his 
UCSD record in the men 's shot 
put with his throw of 58'8" - over 
a foot further than his previous 
effort. His record-setting perfor-
mance was still only good enough 
for ninth place on the day, but no 

one coul d blame him in a fiel d that 
featured such th rowers as shot put 
worl d c hampi on Jo hn God ina , 
who won the competi tion , nation-
al third-place United States finish-
er John D avis and former Pac- \0 
runner-up Van Mounts. T he shot 
put competition, like m ost of the 
other eve nts , was fill ed with top-
!light athl etes with experience on 
the Division I, national and world 
levels. 

"It's hard to \mdersta te it, really," 
Salerno said. "We had some grcat 
performances. Robs performance 
in the hor was exceptional - a 
huge improvement for him. He was 
actually the worst competitor in the 
invi tational part, but he's competi ng 
in the invitational portion, throws a 
PR, and right after him is John 
Godina, world champion, who 
throws 69', 10 feet further than Rob 
- and that's exceptional." 

Jul ie Pope and Lill ian Gardiner 
took second and fourth , respec-
tively, in the women's 3,000-merer 
steeplechase. Pope's 11 :37.86 and 
Gard iner 's 11 :48.92 were also 
good eno ugh for the second- and 
third-best marks in school history. 

Other notable performances 
were turned in by p ara Wilson, 
who took third in the women 's 
long jump and improved on her 
fourth-best school jump with a 
mark of 18'02.5 ", and Audrey 
Sung and Kathy Read, who took 
third and fourth in the women's 
3,000 meters, respectively. 

Salerno said that though it isn 't 
every day that the team gets to 
compete against world champions, 
the focus was still on tunjng up for 
the CCAA Championships in two 
weeks. 

"For [the coaches), it's really 
about them and preparing for con-

ference championships," Salerno 
said. "And even though we're see-
ing some of the top people in the 
nation, we'rc focused on us and 
conference championships. On a 
broader level, though, it's signifi-
cant to have our meet as one of the 
top meets in the country." 

The meet, one of the most 
high-profile events of the season in 
the San Diego area, will certainly 

gain even more prominence, espe-
cially with Powell 's record-break-
ing performance in the discus, the 
fields of Olympian competitors and 
the presence of arguably two of the 
strongest track and field programs 
in the country: USC and UCLA. 

"It's a real good thing for the 
school - we had a couple of thou-

Ten Triton teams gear up for postseason 
Many UCSD teams on the bubble as the season approaches end 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

It's almost May and in the world 
of sports that means one thing: 
playoffs. Not only are two of the 
four major American sports in thc 
midst of the first round of their 
postseasons, nearly every UCSD 
atilletics program is preparing for 
postseason competition. In one 
month, the NCAA will hold nation-
al championships in 13 sports, with 

UCSD squads playing a role in 10 
of them. Below is a team-by-team 
look at the postseason aspirations of 
the UCSD teams. 

Baseball 
The baseball team's late-season 

struggles have put a question mark 
over advancement to the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
postseason. The top four finishers 
in the CCAA advance to a double-
elimination playoff May 9 to May

II at Chico State University. 
The Tritons are the surprise 

team of the CCAA after bringing 
up the rear last season in their first 
ye~r of Division II play. UCSD is 
currently in fourth place with a 
record of 21-15 . Cal State San 
Bernardino is a game behind with 
a 19-15 record, and CCAA 
defending champion Sonoma 
State University is in sixth, 2.5 
games back with a record of 18-17. 

UCSD holds the tiebreaker 
over Cal State San Bernardino with 
a four-game sweep of the Coyotes 
earlier in the season; the Tritons 
split their series with Sonoma 
State. Looking ahead, UCSD trav-
els to third-ranked UC Davis for 
fOllr games; CSUSB has a game left 
with second-place Grand Canyon 
University and bottom-feeder Cal 

. State Stanishius and a four-game 
series with last-place San Francisco 
State University; Sonoma State has 
one game left with Cal State Los 
Angeles before hosting Grand 
Canyon University. 

The CCAA tournament deter-
mines only the winner of the con-
ference; bids to the NCAA tourna-
ment are decided by an eight-
member selection committee. 
Four teams from each region are 

selected to make up the 32-team 
field . The latest regional ranking 
had the Tritons in fourth place, 
but since then UCSD dropped 
seven of 10 games while then fifth-
ranked Grand Canyon has WOIl six 
of nine, including two wins over 
top-ranked Chico State. 

Adding all this information up, 
UCSD has a "magic number" of 
four wins to make the CCAA play-
offs. Once there, it needs a con-
vincing win over Grand Canyon in 
an effort to persuade tile selection 
committee that it is worthy of a 
bid. The 2002 NCAA Division II 
Western Regional will take place at 
the highest-seeded qualifier May 
16 to May 18, The 2002 NCAA 
Baseball Championships will take 
place May 25 toJunc I at Paterson 
Field in Montgomery, Ala. 

Golf 
The golf team finished the sea-

son strongly - so strongly that it 
was able to claim one of the final 
eight bids to the NCAA Western 
Regional to be held May 6 to May 
8 at Estrella Mountain Ranch Golf 
Club in Goodyear, Ariz.
