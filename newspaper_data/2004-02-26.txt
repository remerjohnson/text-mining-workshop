Panel discusses black enrollment 
Watson speaks on status of UCSD diversity 

By SHANNON ELIOT 
Staff Writer 

Students and campus adminis-
trators gathered at the 
Chancellor's Complex on Feb. 25 
to discuss the status of blacks at 
UCSD. The discussion, led by 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W Watson, was the first of 
many upcoming djscussions in the 
Brown Bag Lunch Series, which 
will feature a different vice chan-
cellor every month. 

The talk was sponsored by the 
Ujima Network, an alliance of 
black faculty; staff, and students at 
UCSD. 

The talk proposed to exarrune 
why UCSD has a lower ethnic 
minority percentage than other 
comparable universities, as well as 
offer ways in which these dispari-
ties rrught be resolved. 

Watson opened the discussion 
by addressing affirmative action 
and Proposition 209, wruch has 
prohibited discrimination or pref-
erential treatment of any individual 
or group in public employment or 
education on the basis of race, sex, 
color, ethnicity or national origin. 

"Up until 1997, the university 
was, in at least a public sense, in 
support of affirmative action and

report 

indecent 
exposure 

By MARNETTE FEDERI5 
Associate News Editor 

In the past month, the UCSD 
Police Department has received ' 
three different reports of indecent 
exposure in wruch a white male 
exposed himself to female students. 
The incidents all occurred on a 
Thursday, including Jan. 22, Jan. 
29 and Feb. 19. UCSD police 
believe that the same individual was 
responsible for all three acts. 

Accordffig to detective Nathalliel 
Floyd, indecent exposures on the 
UCSD campus are rare. 

"It's been years since we've actu-
ally had an indecent exposure case; 
it doesn't happen that often, and it 
is surprising to have one, let alone 
three, cases," Floyd said. 

The suspect is described to have 
a height between 5 -feet-9-inches 
ana 6-feet-2-inches with a thin 
build and short dark brown hair. 
The suspect also has a tattoo on the 
calf of his left leg. During the first 
two incidents, the suspect wore a 
dark blue blazer, running shorts 
an.d running shoes.The suspect is

diversity issues," Watson said. 
"With the passage of SP-I and 
SP-2, and later with Proposition 
209, the university stance is very 
overtly anti-affirmative action. It 
is not a sympathetic attitude by 
the Regents." 

Blacks comprise one percent of 
UCSD's student population. Many 
in the room, including Watson, 

. voiced their feelings that trus num-
ber was not only unacceptable, but 
embarrassing. 

"If African-Americans are six to 
seven percent of the graduating 
rugh school class in California, 
then yes, I believe they should be 
six to seven percent of the entering 
class of the uruversity, but they're 
one percent," Watson said. "We 
have an absolute disaster here, and 
we have some univer ity leadership 
that feels [the current numbers) 
are more than acceptable."

campus concerns: Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph W Watson 
discusses affinnative action on Feb. 25. 

Another topic that was touched 
upon during the di cussion was

accepted. Sixty percent of the 
acceptants choose to attend 
UCSD, according to Watson. 
Among various possible reasons for 
trus trend, Watson said, is the lack 
of an African-American studies 
program at UCSD. 

Watson said that despite the 
relatively recent implementation of 
the adrrussions policy of compre-
hensjve review, only 24 percent of

Proposal would pare 
Pell Grant budget 
UCSD students would pay 
$700,000 extra in loan fees 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Califorruans will have to pay 
out as much as $40 rrullion more 
next year in student loan fees, 
including an extra $700,000 by 
UCSD students, if Congress 
approves the proposals included in 
President George W Bush's bud-
get. Under the plan, several feder-
al financial aid programs would 
receive cuts and fundjng for most 
programs would remam flat. 

Education groups called the 
plan a disappointment for stu-
dents and uruversities already 
enduring tuition increases and 
cuts in state fundi ng. 

"It's a budget that says to stu-
dents, 'Work more, borrow more 
or drop to part-time because the 
federal government will not pro-
vide the resources," said Becky 
Timmons, director of govern-
ment relations at the American 
Council on Education, a coordi-
nating body for higher education 
institutions. "We trunk it's com-
pletely inadequate. It doesn't even 
begin to reflect the need students 
have for assistance." 

The president's record $57.3 
billion proposal for the U.S. 
Deparonent of Education includ-
ed a three-percent annual increase, 
the largest of any domestic agency. 
Most of the extra money goes to 
primary and secondary education. 

Education Secretary Rod 
Paige praised Bush's funding plan 
for education at a press confer-
ence on Feb. 2. 

"With his 2005 budget 
request, President Bush has reaf-
firmed rus commitment to our 
nation's children, parents and 
teachers," Paige Â· said. "And I 
believe that one day, we will look 
back on these years and say that 
this was the turrung point." 

The plan calls for an addjtion-
al $2 billion to fund special educa-
tion and support needy schools. 

With his 2005 budget, Bush 
included a request for Congress 
to require studen~ to pay a guar-
antee fee on student loans they 
take out after October 2004, 
totaling one percent of the 
amount borrowed. The money 
would be used to reimburse

Education bond up 
for vote on March 2 
Proposition 55 would finance 

K-12 schools, colleges 
By MARGRO GONZALES 

Staff Writer 

Students will be among those 
voting March 2 on whether to pass 
the Kindergarten-University 
Public Education Facilities Bond 
Act of 2004, better known a 
Proposition 55, intended to fund 
California K-12 public schools and 
higher education learning through 
general obligation bonds. 

Proposition 55, which is 
endorsed by the UC Board of 
Regents, is a bond measure that 
would supply funding for education 
facilities in K-12 schools and 
California Commuruty Colleges, 
the Califorrua State Uruversity and 
the University of California systems. 

The university stands to gain a 
total of $690 rrullion with which to 
build new buildings and help fund 
the number of future incorrung stu-
dents, UC Office of the President 
spokeswoman Abby Lunardini said. 

"We need the capital support," 
Lunardini said. "We have been 
underfunded for years, and the cap-

ital budget will face many shortfalls 
if trus proposal fails to pass." 

Projects listed under 
Propo ition 55 for UCSD include 
about $20 rrullion for the tudent 
Acaderruc ervices Facility, ab ut 
$25 million for Mayer Hall renova-
tion, and a tentative $3 7 million for 
the Music Building, expected to 
total $110 million for 2004-05 and 
2005-06 if the bond passes, accord-
ing to the Regents Budget for 
Capital Improvements. The ~i cal 
impact of the bond would be about 
$24.7 billion: $12.3 billion to p:ly 
off the bond's principal and anoth-
er $12.4 billion in interest over 
time. 

Opponents of the propo ition, 
including the 60-Plu ociation 
and the National Tax-Limitation 
Comrruttee, argue that the state is 
already in a situation of financial 
crisis and to spend more money 
would mean higher taxes for 
California taxpayers.

California Supreme Court rejeds 
UCSA lawsuit against governor 

Plaintiffs can file case in California Superior Court 
By BRYAN TSAO 

Associate News Editor 

The California state Supreme 
Court refused to consider the law-
suit brought against Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger by the UC 
Student Association, Californians 
for Justice and several UC stuÂ· 
dents, referring the case to the 
California Superior Court without 
prejudice. Justice Joyce Kennard 
dissented, believing that the 
Supreme Court should consider 
the lawsuit. 

The plaintiffs have been seelcing 
a ruling against Schwarzenegger's 
$148 million mid-year budget cuts 
to the UC and CSU systems and 
his administration's rolling back of 
the vehicle license fee ' increase 
implemented by fonner Gov. Gray 
Davis. 

The plaintiffs argue that 'the 
California Revenue and Tax Code 
allows unilateral budget reduc-
tions by the ~overnor only if there 
is a budget issue that is unantici-
pated and unavoidable. The law-
suit filed in the state Supreme 
Court contends that the current 
budget crisis was caused by 
Schwarzenegger's decision to roll 
back the vehicle license fee, and . 
therefore both anticipated and 
avoidable. The vehicle license fee 
hike would have increased rev-
enues by $4 billion. 

The UCSA sent a letter to tile 
state attorney general's office on 
Feb. 23 requesting additional Â· 
information regarding the imple-
mentation of the governor's mid-
year cuts. The plaintiffs have not 
yet decided whether or not to file 

in Superior Court. 
"We submitted a letter to the 

attorney general's office to con-
firm that the mid-year budget cuts 
were going forward, and we 
haven't received a response,Â» said 
Warrington Parker In, the lawyer 
representing UCSA. "A critical 
factor is whether the mid-year 
budget cuts are going forward and 
whether they will require legisla-
tive approval." 

" The chances for success 
[of the lawsuit} depend a 

lot on the responses to 
our letters. " 

Parker said that if the mid-year 
cuts are going forward but do not 
require legislative approval, the 
plaintiffs' beSt option is to file in 
the Superior Court. If the cuts are 
going forward and the governor 
seeks legislative approval, Parker 
said, the plaintiffs "may seek some 
other relief. Â» 

Parker doesn't believe that the 
state Supreme Court's rejection 
significantly impacts the lawsuit's 
chances of success, citing the 
Attorney General's response as the 
critical factor in the case at this 
point. The plaintiffs expect a 
response by Feb. 27 and will meet 
to discuss their options after a 

response is received. 
"The rejection does not bear 

on our chances for success because 
the California Supreme Court has 
explicitly provided that we can file 
in Superior Court," Parker said. 
"The chances for success depend a 
lot on the responses to our letters." 

UCSA Executive Director 
Elizabeth Geyer believes that the 
lawsuit has already succeeded in 
influencing Schwarzenegger's pol-
icy. 

"[There are indications that) the 
governor has actually changed his 
position and is submitting his cuts 
to the legislature," Geyer said. "So 
it would significantly affect our next 
steps ifit was finally official that the 
governor is retracting his unilateral 
cuts and submitting them to the 
legislature. It could possibly mean 
that we will not re-file in a lower 
coun because we would consider 
that a significant victory." 

According to Geyer, if the 
reduction will be considered by the 
legislature and the case is not re-
filed in Superior Coun, then the 
UCSA will initiate lobbying efforts 
targeting the state assembly, inel ud-
ing mailing and calling campaigns. 

"We would make sure that the 
members of the legislature knew 
that we were strongly opposed to 
the cuts," Geyer said. 

The n:id-year budget reduc-
tions included the elimination of 
state funding for UC and CSU K-
12 outreach programs and major 
reductions to the UC Institute for 
Labor and Employment. The 
plaintiffs cited the elimination of 
support for outreach programs as 
the main impetus for their lawsuit.

NEW 

Regents appoint first 
female UC provost 
UC Santa CruZ Chancellor 

M.R.C. Greenwood selected 
By WLLE FAURE 

News Editor 

UC Santa Cruz Chancellor 
M.R.C. Greenwood became the 
first woman to be appointed to the 
UC system's second-highest posi-
tion on Feb. 23 . 

The UC Regents announced in 
a special meeting that Greenwood 
would become 
UC provost and 
senior vice pres-
ident of academÂ· 
ic affairs begin-
ning April I. 

"M.R . C. 
Greenwood pos-
sesses tremenÂ· 
dous energy, aca-
demic accom-
plishment and 
administrative 
skill," said UC 
President Robert 
C. Dynes, who 
submitted

nomination to the Board of Regents, 
in a Feb. 23 StlItement. "She brings 
the perfect credentials to this posi-
tion." 

Over the past eight years with 
Greenwood at its helm, UCSC has 
seen the addition of two new resi-
dential colleges, a 54-percent 
increase in enrollment, a doubling 
in the number of its academic pro-
grams and the opening of its first 
professional school. 

"As I said upon my arrival, UC 
Santa Cruz is 'a jewel in the crown' of 
the university," Greenwood said in a 

statement to the UCSC community. 
"Yet, we find ourselves ~vith 'the 
whole crown' - the entire university 
- at risk in most perilous times." 

Greenwood, who was recom-
mended from a pool of about 60 
candidates, will oversee planning, 
research and academic policies for 
the entire J O-campus system. 

She stressed that the university, 
in times of "fiscal crisis," needs to 
increase understanding of its 
impact on the state and its snldents. 

"Both political pressure and bud-
getary constraints are making it 
increasingly difficult for all public 
universities, even the great ones like 
UC, to prosper," she said. "VYhether 
California will honor the promises 
of the internationally revered 
Master Plan for Higher Education is 
a question we must face . It is in the 
context of addressing these far-
reaching challenges that I join the 
Office of the President." 

Upon her appointment, she said 
she viewed becoming the highest-
ranking woman in the UC system 
as a positive example for others in 
higher educa tion. 

"If you look around the nation, 
women arc beginning to appear in 
senior leadershi p posi tions in highÂ· 
er education," Greenwood said. 
"This is something J think that for 
many of our young profes ors ... 
and other people who are looking 
for role models, it [is] probably a

There's still time to 
run for A.S. Council 

T he California recall election, with its field of 135 candi-
dates, gOt at least one 
thing right. 

Everyone should have a 
chance to run for office. 

At UCSD, this means 
every interested under-
graduate should take the 
plunge and run for an A.S. 
Council position. Last 
year, the dismal pool of 
candidates resulted in a 
heap of largely unqualified 
slate-fillers running unop-
posed for their positions 
and, in at least one 
instance, an open position 
with no candidates at all. 

Let's not let th~t hafpen 
again. In a schoo of 
24,000 undergraduates, it 
should not be too difficult 
to find 25 srudents willing 
to make a difference. Ana 
with the new runoff voting 

system, independents 
might have a fighting 
chance. In a close race, an 
independent candidate 
may not win outright, but 
could still make the runoff. 

This year's appointed-
not elected - commis-
sioners and Vice President 
Finance Eric Webster's 
success proves that apoliti-
cal independent candi-
dates can make effective 
officers. 

Make this the year 
UCSD's elections rerurn 
to the democratic process 
we had three years ago: 
four large slates, dozens of 
candidates and a clean 
election with no disqualifi-
cations. The filing dead-
line is March 1 at noon. 
Candidate packets are 
available from the A.S. 
secretary on the third floor 
of Price Center. 

Democrats should 
follow SF mayor's lead 
I f the las t few months are any indication, 2004 will likely see the 
groundwork laid for a 
national civil rights 
debate: whether gays are 
entitled to equal marriage 
rights. Recent legal victo-
ries for gay couples in the 
high courts of Vermont 
and Massachusetts 
countered by threats of 
new state and national 
amendments banning 
same-sex marriage - have 
led politicians to finally 
begin to deem the issue 
worthy of debate. 

Equal rights in all 
spheres of public and pri-
va te life for those who are 
gay should be a given for a 
nation that intellectually 
and legally cherishes 
equa lity and freedom. 

It is in this spirit that 
San Franci sco Mayor 
Gavin Newsom has nobly 
granted marriage licenses 
to gay couples in the name 
of the California 
Constitution's equal pro-
tection clause. 

Troublesome as this 

may seem to California 
voters who in 2000 passed 
Proposition 22 forbidding 
same-sex marriage, 
Newsom and supporters 
are correct in their claims: 
The infringement of a 
population's consti tutionaI 
civil rights takes prece-
dence over Proposition 22 . 
Newsom's action will 
inevitably force the issue 
to the California Supreme 
Court, which will hopeful-
ly rule that the state con-
stirution guarantees same-
sex couples the right to 
marry, as did the 
Massachusetts Supreme 
Court with a similar 
starute. 

If only other democrats 
were so bold. Sen. John 
Kerry (D-Mass.) and Sen. 
John Edwards (D-N.C.) 
must stop ski rting the 
issue and support gay mar-
riage, especially in light of 
President George W. 
Bush's recent call for a dis-
criminatory national 
amendment banning gay 
marriage. 

Students fight back 
College graduates are necessary to 

drive the economy. Hiking fees won't 
fix anything in the long run.

., I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
9/11 course criticism 

was unwarranted 
Editor: 

Whoever said satire was 
dead? 

My first instinct upon reading 
Chris Taylor's piece in the Feb. 
23 issue of the Guardian ("Public 
Universities Should Not 
Indoctrinate Students") was to 
see it as a distressingly pre-
dictable assault upon academic 
freedom, complete with wildly 
reckless and baseless allegations 
- chief among them the charge 
that my course "September 11th 
and its Aftermath" exclusively 
(or indeed, in any way) promotes 
the idea that America deserved 
the attacks, and that it is most 
important to understand what 
America did wrong, rather than 
what the terrorists did wrong. 

But after reflecting upon the 
matter a bit, I realized what a 
serious misreading this was, and 
came to the conclusion that 
Taylor must have been up to 
something more interesting. 

After all , since this is the first 
time the course has been offered, 
and since Taylor is not enrolled 
in the course, a reader wanting 
to take him seriously would have 
to ask how he had determined 
the focus of fhe course. 

The idea that America 
deserved to be attacked is cer-
tainly not in the course descrip-
tion, though I suppose someone 
devoted to providing a particu-

" The idea that America deserved to 
be attilCked is 

certainly not in the 
A/I~~"" , " course (.1(;.)1..1 'PUDn ...

larly creative misreading might 
be able to find it there. 

Someone taking Taylor's 
argument at face value might 
also question what it means to 

"exclusively" pursue such a nar-
row agenda in a ten week course. 
In fact, the course addresses a 
variety of topics including: theo-
ries about the l\ature of terror-
ism; U.S. foreign policy in the 
Middle East; American civil lib-
erties and efforts to maintain 
domestic security; shifts in 
domestic spending priorities 
post-9/11; hate crimes in the 
wake of the attacks and the 
nature of national unity; media 
representations and collective 
memory of Sept, 11. 

So, of course, to take Taylor 
seriously would be to betray a 
hopeless lack of humor, and to 
miss the point entirely. What 
better way to critique right-.wing 
efforts to undermine academic 
freedom than to parody the ludi-
crous tendency of equating criti-
cal analysis with admiration for 
terrorists! 

There have been many efforts 
to counter allegations that liber-
al or left-wing professors have 
run amok in academia and are 
busy "indoctrinating" their Stu -
dents, but none shine more 
brightly than this piece, Taylor's 
decision to mimic the voice of an 
unthinking right-wing zealot 
provides him with the opportu-
nity to express hackneyed argu-
ments about academic bias in 
their most exaggerated form, 
and it is truly inspired.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2004 THE U SD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

U.K. provides lessons for funding college educations 
Grads should not have to payoff loans that are beyond their means 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

The University of California is not the only public uni-versity system dealing with 
budget issues at the moment. A 
couple weeks ago, United 
Kingdom Prime Minjster Tony 
Blair barely survived when a pro-
posa l by his government to raise 
tuition fees for England's ailing 
university system slipped through 
Parliament on what amounted to a 
near no-confidence vote. Blair's 
proposal to raise the maximum 
fees at England's system of pub-
licly supported universities 
(including Cambridge and 
Oxford) from Â£ 1,125 ($2,000) to 
Â£3,000 ($5,400) per year faced 
widespread opposition within his 
own Labour 'party, largely because 
of the party's socialist roots . 

In California, a similar increase 
in the UC system goes largely 
unnoticed by the general public . 
because we have a contrasting sys-
tem of private universities that can 
leave students far more heavi ly in 
debt. The university fees vote 
nearly triggered a crisis of confi-
dence in Bla}r's leadership because 
of the social shock that paying for 
higher education presents in 
England. Many interesting ideas 
as to how to fund the university 
system emerged during the 

â¢ 

debate, some of which might very 
well be applicable to the 
California situation. 

The pertinent question at hand 
in the British situation that has 
not been sufficiently posed ID 
California is: When public uni-
versities need money, whose 
responsibility is it to fund them? 
This is not just a question of 
undergraduate education 
(although that of course is the 
most tangible result) but also a 
question of funding research, and 
recruiting faculty and graduate 
students who "add value" to the 
diplomas of UC undergraduates 
by enhancing the reputation of 
the university. Should all the peo-
ple of the state of California, 
regardless of educational back-
ground, bear that cost? Or how 
about the graduates themselves, 
since they are the direct beneficia-
ries of a partially state-funded 
education? 

vVhile the latter might seem 
the most fair, when confronted 
with the choice between losing 
$20,000 a year for several years 
and making $30,000 a year, how 
can we guarantee to the poorest of 
students that a university educa-
tion will not cripple them finan-
cially for years to come, should 
employment be difficult to come 
by? Or how about a less appealing 
case: Should a middle-class stu-
dent have to drain all of his fami-
ly's savings to afford a public edu'-
cation? Should a UC education 
come down to a question of cost-
benefit economics rather than a 
guaranteed principle? 

The most interesting proposals 
to come out of the British situa-
tion confronted that very ques-
tion. Perhaps the most rational 
choice would be to face hard facts 
and eat Ramen for several years 
while attending school and subse-
quently paying off loans. As a 
society, should we predicate the 
availability of higher education on 
the rationality of individuals 
under pressure (for all their talk of 
lower taxes and individual free-
doms, one wonders how the cam-
pus conservatives would view the 

" When public universities 
need money, whose 

responsibility is it to fwu1 
them?" 

logical extrapolation of their 
views: complete privatization of 
the University of California, with 
subsequently higher tuition)? Of 
the solutions that placed the bur-
den on graduates, what would be 
the most psychologically palatable 
alternative' Is it government-sub-
sidized loans, as the United States 
often does? Perhaps the most effi -
cient means of allocating funds, 
loans place a direct burden on stu-
dents for which they are personal-
ly responsible . If the goal is to 
convince students to feel they can 
afford higher education regardless 
of their means, loans seem 

counter-productive, especially 
because they start to accrue inter-
est as soon as students graduate 
regardless of employment oppor-
tunities. 

How about an extra tax for col -
lege graduates in California? The 
problem is that it would potential-
ly drive away UC graduates from 
California, which would render 
the entire question of educating 
Californians moor. Also, UC 
graduates would be paying a life-
time of taxes for an cducation of 
only four years, which 30 years 
down the road might create an 
unsustainable system where cur-
rent undergraduates depended on 
untold generations of resentful 
graduates (somewhat like Social 
Security, except in that system one 
grows into benefits instead of out 
of them). â¢ 

The new British system instead 
strikes a gentle balance: 
Graduates pay the loans back as 
part of their taxes, at a rate of at 
least 9 percent of their income 
every year they earn more than 
Â£15,000 ($27,000). Any debts out-
standing after 25 years are written 
off. 

As a result, graduates are 
responsible for paying their way 
through their own education. 
Society, however, assumes the cost 
of their education should it prove 
to be worthless, and defers pay-
ment until the graduate makes 
enough money to justify the edu-
cation. It also reinforces the ca use 
and effect of higher education 
leading to a higher income. This 

system would be possible in the 
United States if our loan repay-
ment deferral system required 
federal tax returns, and deferred 
repayments were covered by mar-
ginally higher tuitions on other 
graduates of the same class. 

In contrast, the federally ubsi-
dized Stafford loans in the United 
States require repayment within 
10 years. Payments start almost 
immediately afte r graduation, 
regardless of means. While this no 
doubt requires personal account-
ability, it cannot be an appealing 
prospect for a student faci ng the 
decision of whether to burden 
either his family or himself with 
the (newly rai sed) fees for attend-
ing the University of California. If 
our goal is to encourage studen ts 
of all means that an education is 
attainable at minimal cos t, the 
university might do well to look to 
the British. Instead of means- test-
ing everybody by their family cir-
cumsta nces coming into the 
University of California to deter-
mine which rich students will sub-
sidize which poor students, let the 
most successful graduates subsi-
dize the less successfu l onc after 
graduation .

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 26, Z004 

Breaking down 6break-ups' and what friends can do 
Cutting all ties may prove more difficult than expected 

By ISRA YAGHOUBI 
Contributing Writer 

It is all too rare that college 
students show sympathy for the 
lover who chooses to end a rela-
tionship - also known as the 
"dumper." It is all too often that 
college students overreact with 
sympathy for the shocked and 
brokenhearted "dumped," espe-
cially if the "dumping" is done 
over the phone or through a let-
ter. There are many reasons why 
this happens, but the reasons for 
why it should not happen are 
more compelling. 

Imagine thi s dialogue over 
lunch at Price Center food court: 
"Yeah man, it 's over. But get this 
- she told me over the phone." 

"That's hars h, man . Totally 
Â·,uncool." 

Or how about, "He ended it. 
But can you believe that he wrote 
it to me in a letttr?" 

"I'm so sorry, That's not just 
cruel, that's lame." 

Within a dialogue consisting of 
a few short exchanges, feelings are 
shared and judgments have been 
made. Yet only one s ide of the 
story has been hea rd . Why is 

there a tendency to be critical of 
one party, the "dumper," with 
uch one-sided information? 

The tendency to show sympa-
thy toward someone in pain is 
understandable, especially toward 
a friend. It is difficult and perhaps 
uncomfortable to experience, live 
and direct the hurt of another per-
son. With someone crying to your 
face, chances are you won'! stare 
at them stoically and state, "Get 
over it ." That they allowed them-
selves to open up indicates some 
level of trust, which also impli-
cates some level of responsibility 
to you, the listener, to respond 
appropriately. But what is an 
appropriate response? 

It goes without saying, given 
the moral relativity of any situa-
tion, that there is no single appro-
priate response. But there are typ-
ical responses - better yet, 
cliche' responses commonly 
offered to those in pain, especially 
to the dumped party of a former 
relationship. These responses 
often come without deep consid-
eration of the situation. 

When break-ups are discussed 
openly and dramatically in a pub-
lic space, there is an overwhelm-

ing occurrence of knee-jerk reac -
tions to the "uncool " and "wimpy" 
means people use to end a rela-
tionship - namely, over the 
phone or through a letter. The 
consensus seems to be that the 
"real" way to do it, the "best" way 
to do it, the most humane way to 

" breakup confusion 
might be avoided by 
creating a contract 

or plan at the 
beginning of the 
relationship , .. " 

do it, is in person. Yet it's ridicu-
lous to assume that everyone 
would want to approach ending a 
relationship the same "ideal" way. 
People have varying tastes in food, 
music and humor. Is it fair to 
expect that when handling some-
thing as intricate and intimate as a 
relationship people should act 

uniformly? 
While the dumped person 

often deals with shock, hurt, con-
fusion, low self-esteem and loneli-
ness, among other emotions, it is 
often the case that the "dumper" 
deals with some of these feelings 
too. 

The dumper and the dumped 
were both in the relationship -
both shared deeply personal 
aspects of who they are and both Â· 
became highly connected. The 
loss of that connection will affect 
both parties, though in different 
ways. If that connection is no 
longer felt by one of the lovers, it 
is not because that individual has 
mutated into a cold and callous 
automaton. 

From the dumper's perspec-
tive, there is probably a level of 
confusion and sadness with the 
paradoxical realization that it's 
possible to be very close to some-
one and yet not feel for them as 
strongly as in the past. To realize 
that the spark is gone may bring a 
sense of loss, of something miss-
ing, not to mention a load of guilt 
if the other party feels differently. 

Yet if the desire to be in a rela-
tionship has faded on one end, the

relationship needs to be seriously 
questioned. In the case of a rela-
tionship, each individual has the 
responsibility to be primarily true 
to his or her own needs and 
desires. Reina Juarez from 
Psychological Counseling 
Services at UCSD notes that this 
is very important and that "it takes 
courage for people to face their 
own personal truths, even if it 
means hurting some one they care 
for. We must be responsible for 
ourselves." So, as much as stu-
dents care for, trust and feel loyal 
to their friends, it must be noted 
that there is another side to the 
story. This is why it's advisable to 
resist making a judgment too 
quickly, especially considering the 
complex dynamics that govern 
relationships. ' 

Consider relationships that 
have gone sour, dull or distant. 
Even these are hard to break off 
because people grow accustomed 
to a powerful relationship dynam-
ic - that of "having someone 
there." Someone to provide a 
warm body at night, to eat dinner 
with, watch television with , study 
at Geisel with, complain ro, etc. 
It's frightening to realize how 
dependent on intimate social con-
tact people can be, especially col-
lege students isolated from fam ily 
and lifelong friends. But it is not 
unusual. This makes it all the 
more challenging to end those 
few rel ationships that are com-
forting si mply by virtue of being 
routine. 

In addition , it's necessary to be 
sensitive ro the fact that each incli-
vidual has strengths ' and weak-
nesses, and not everyone's 
strength is confrontation . Few 
people seek to incite negative en-
tirnents, and the tendency is ro 
avoid bringing up deeply trou-
bling issues. Men, sometimes, say 
nothing and keep issues inside. 
Women, sometimes, make hints, 
hoping that men will be percep-
tive enough to figure it out. 
Imagine the difficulty noncon-
frontational people would have in 
trying to end a relationship face-
to-face. 

There are also unique situa-
tions in which writing a letter or 
calling on the phone are ideal 
ways to end a relationship. Think 
of all those long-distance relation-
ships that begin in high school or 
at a year abroad, but soon find 
much difficulty in maintaining 
significant connection, If the 
option of meeling the languishing 
lover is not available until much 
later, should the dumper wait 
three months, all the while con-
cealing his or her emotions and 
fighting attraction to others? Or 
worse, start dating someone else 
secre tly, while holding off the 
break-up for the "in person" stip-
ulation) 

Consider the milder type of 
person, the one who knows with 
certainty that he or she wants to 
end a relationship but can't handle 
the unstable, histrionic or violent 
response expected from the more 
dominant beau. Or, consider the 
type of person that expresses him-
or herself most clearly in writing. 

Now this is not a blanket 
endorsement for one break-up style 
or another. Ultimately, importance 
does not lie in the means by which 
a break-up is guided, but rather 
how clearly, sensitively and respect-
fully the ending of the relationship 
is approached and handled. Juarez 
says that "at [the college) age, peo-
ple's relationships are sometimes 
shallow, and [when ending one) 
they just walk away from it." She 
suggests that break-up confusion 
might be avoided by creating a con-
tract or plan at the beginning of a 
relationship that communicates

Fee hikes are not inevitable 
Small tax increase would ease burden 

on stu,de'nts .by diffusing costs 
By MARIANNE MADDEN 

Senior Staff Writer 

As hundreds of people 
descended on Price Center Feb, 
17 to protest the newest round of 
UC fee hikes, the debate raged 
over whether such fee hikes are a 
necessary response to California's 
budget crisis or a bad policy that 
will undermine the quality of the 
UC system. 

In his State of the State 
Address on Jan. 6, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger had no shortage 
of justifications for his proposed 
fee hikes. UC fees have already 
been raised 40 percent over the 
last two years, and 
Schwarzenegger sought to put a 
positive spin on his additional 
increases by saying, "We must 
end the boom-and-bust cycle of 
widely fluctuating fees with a pre-
dictable, capped fee policy fo r 
college students and their par-
ents . And we Â· must limit fee 
increases to no more than 10 per-
cen t a year':' 

In short, Schwarzenegger tried 
to present a IO-percent annual fee 
increase as some sort of favor, as if 
unprecedented fee hikes are 
inevitable. Yet, UC faculty mem-
bers aren't being paid more and 
the costs to provide a UC educa-
tion aren't being pushed upwards; 
why should students pay more for 
the same Â· service we received 
much cheaper two years ago? . 

When viewed from an eco-
nomic standpoint, education is a 
product consumed by students, 
and the price of the service should 
ri se onl y as the value of the service 
increases. Yet California has a $15 
billion budget cns.s, and 
Schwarzenegger sees this as a jus-
tification for extorti ng money 
from students and cutting their 
financial aid . 

Budget crisis or no, students 
are the last people who should pay 
off California's budget crisis. 
Furthermore, the policy of using 
students as piggy banks will harm 
California and the UC system in 
the long run , 

According to the U.S. Census, 
whites ea rned an average of 
$31,700 annually in 2000, while 
Latinos averaged SII ,674, Asians 
$22,050, and blacks S 17,447. 
These figures show that there is a 
real and sizable income gap 
between races, and that ~hites, 
which constitute 46.7 percent of 
Californians, out-earn all other 
races. 

In other words, these fee 
increases and cuts in financial aid 
will amount to a disproportionate 
burden on the 40 percent or so of 
Californians who aren't white. So 
when the director of the Office of 
Academic SuppOrt and 
Instructional Services, Patrick ' 
Velasquez, said at the Price 

Center rally that these fee hikes 
will create less diversity in the 
University of California , he was 
right: The numbers show that 
minority students, on the whole, 
come from poorer families and 
would constitute the majority of 
students forced out of the UC sys-
tem by the proposed fee hikes and 
cuts to financial aid. 

This should be disturbing news 
to all Californians. Shutting 
minority students out of the 
University of California hurts the 
quality and reputation of the uni-
versity itself, and unfairly blocks 
education to the very students 
who can benefit the most from a 
college education. The income 
gap between races is largely 
caused by disparities in education-
allevels, which relegate minorities 
to less lucrative jobs. Hence, the 
way to erase this gap is to open the 
doors to education for minority 
students so they can climb higher 

" 
... in the end. these fee 

increases wiU do nothing 
to increase the state's 

. revenue." 

on the income scale. Making a UC 
education prohibitively expensive 
for these students is, of course, no 
way to accomplish economic and 
educational equality. Further, it 
should never happen in a school 
that bills itself as public and is 
supported by every taxpayer in 
California. 

"Like our kindergarten 
through 12th grade schools, our 
colleges and uni versi ties must also 
share the burden of the fisca l cri-
sis, but we must work to expand 
the dream of college," remarked 
Schwarzenegger as he announced 
the 10-percent annual increase in 

. UC tuition. The rheroric is pleas-
ant, but his proposa l is the quick-
est way to make "the dream of col-
lege" (college at the University of 
California, at least) financially 
impossible for more and more 
high school seniors. 

The University of California is 
the site of an incredible amount of 
racial, economic and cultural 
diversity, which is what public 
education is all about. The budget 
crisis may give us an easy reason 
to squeeze revenue out of stu-
dents, but we should hardly com-
promise the appeal of the univer-
sity - diversity and a lot of bang 
for one's buck - in favor of tem-
porarily easing California's finan-
cial struggle. Especially when, in 
the end, these fee increases will do 
nothing to increase the state's rev-
enue. 

Schwarzenegger's proposal also 
includes a whopping 40-percent 
increase in tuition for graduate stu-
dents; needless to say, .this 40-per-
cent increase is enough to erase the 
incentive for students to attend the 
University of California for gradu-
ate school. A UCSD medical stu-
dent who spoke at the rally predict-
ed a "brain drain out of the state" as 
students avoid rising UC costs by 
attending private or out-of-state 
schools. His prediction is likely 

. correct in light of a 1996 RAND 
Corporation study that found that 
every IO-percent increase in UC 
fees would lead to a half-percent 
decrease in enrollment. 

The big pull of the University 
of California is that it's a bargain; 
make it less of a bargain, and stu-
dents will seek education else-
where. Because of this likely 
decrease in enrollment, the aim of 
the fee hikes - increased revenue 
to the state to ease the budget cri-
sis - will most likely never mate-
riali ze. 

Further, a decrease of graduate 
school enrollment would end up 
hurting California's industry, as 
smaller pools of doctors, lawyers 
and other professionals would be 
hired in California as they finish 
their degrees. It's in California's 
best interest to make education 
affordable for the maximum num-
ber of students because highly 
educated people make money, 
spend money, and keep business 
and investment alive. Education 
may entail a large initial invest-
ment, but it pays for itself in the 
end. 

In short, the costs of increasing 
UC fees while cutting financial 
aid are hardly worth the benefits. 
Schwarzenegger, the man. who 
bills himself as "the education 
governor" and "a man of the peo-
ple," would do well to live up to 
these labels. 

In hi s State of the State speech, 
Schwarzenegger said, "I want 
your ideas, and the more radical 
the better. " Here's a radical idea, 
then: Raise taxes, just a little, and 
have everyone share in the burden 
of the budget c risis, not just 
California's already cash-strapped 
students. 

Taking a miniscule percentage 
of each person's income would go 
a long way toward mending the 
budget crisis, whereas increasing 
student fees would go nowhere. 
Paying a slightly higher tax might 
be annoying, but it's a lot less 
severe than making the University 
of California prohibitively expen-
sive for some students. And best 
yet, the tax money will come back 
to taxpayers in the long run . It 
benefits everyone for California to 
have a more balanced budget and 
a healthy group of college gradu-
ates to support California's indus-
try. 

Relationships: Make break .. up terms clear 
continued from page 6 

ideas of how each person would 
end the relationship if they had to. 
This way, expectations are clear 
and there is knowledge about what 
to anticipate from the partner -
whether he or she is the type who 
wants to be cut off completely or 
the type who wants to try friend-
ship afterwards, 

One can never be in another's 
shoes, heart or soul, but picking lip 
on the pain of a heartbroken friend 
inevitably happens. The role of a 
caring friend should not be to join 
in the crying to form a duet of pain 
and sorrow, or to encourage the 
dumped buddy to ruminate in 
anger and hurt. Empathy can be 

practiced by attentive listening, not 
wholesale nodding. 

" Helping shed the role 
f ' ' , , o VlCtlm ... may 

help to mitigate the 
pain that the 

dumped feels .. ," 
A friend can help by looking at 

the big picture and, when the 
dumped is ready to hear it, showing 

that the ending of a relationship has 
multiple effects for all involved . 
Helping shed the role of "victim" 
(that the dumped so often takes) 
and encouraging an understanding 
of events in a larger context may 
help to mitigate the pain that the 
dumped feels so overwhelmingly; 
the dumper is most likely taking 
the transition hard, too. 

lf you feel overwhelmed by 
pain, too alienated from friends or 
fear burdening them, a strong sup-
port network is available, confiden-
tial and free, at UCSD's 
Psychological Counseling Services.

Talks: Watson first vice 
chancellor in discussion series 

continued from page J 
African-Americans to the campus, 
not because they're all going to 
major in it - in fact, the majority 
of them will not even take a course 
in it - but it's symbolic," Watson 
said. "It shows that African-
Americans are part of the academ-
ic program of the campus; it's a 
symbolic indication that yes, 
you're part of the campus." 

UCLA and UC Berkeley, which 
enroll roughly ninety percent of 
accepted black students, WatsOn 
said, possess African-American 
studies programs. 

"[The UJIMA Network) is 
hoping that the chancellor and 
academic affairs will take this on," 
Executive Officer of Student 
Affairs Darlene Willis said. "We 
are trying to move in that direc-
tion and let the campus know that 
this is very important." 

One student in attendance also 
suggested the idea of black culture-
themed houses in which black stu-
dents could find a support network 
lind feel more integrated into the 
campus commwuty. 

While Watson remained opti-

mistic for the potential of increas-
ing the number of black students a( 
UCSD, he spoke of the difficulty of 
implementing policy changes and 
the necessi ty of a straightforward 
dialogue among university officials. 

"This is a period in which 
resources are limited, and therefore 
there are not the human and finan-
cial resources to do everything that 
may be desirable," Watson said. 
"However, [ think theres still lots 
of things that can be done. The first 
thing that needs to be done is for 
[university leadership) to state that 
there is a problem and there should 
be z. change. The second thing that 
should be done is that some action 
should be taken to favor underrep-
resented groups. If you have a 
.group that is one-seventh of what it 
should be, why shouldn't you take 
actions to bring it more into parity 
with their representation? 1 think 
there is need for some open, honest 
discussion. " 

The next gathering in the 
Brown Bag Lunch Series will fea-
ture Vice Chancellor of External 
Relations J ames Langley and will 
take place on March 29. 

Indecent: Police believe 
single individual responsible 

continued from page I 
de cribed to be between 24 and 30 
years old. 

According to Floyd, the suspect 
typically waits in an area and tries 
to make eye contact with the vic-
tim. Floyd said tha t as soon as the 
victim makes eye contact, the sus-
pect will expose his penis and mas-
turbate in the victim's presence. 

"He typically wears running 
shorts and tennis shoes, and he'll 
wait and pretend as if he's stretch-
ing, getting ready to run," Floyd 
said, "The incidents are very quick. 
Once eye contact is made, he 
exposes himself and, at that point, 
as the victi m wa Iks away, he also 
runs off into in the distance." 

The first incident occurred on 
Jan. 22 at 1:35 p.m. at UCSD 
School of Medicine's Lot 60S. The 
second incident occurred on Jan , 
29 at S:4O p,m. at Lot 403, near 
Canyonview Pool. During the Feb, 
19 incident, which occurred at 
3:15 p.m . at the Wagner Dance 
Studio near Mandell Weiss 
Theater, the suspect was described 
as wearing a long-sleeved shirt and 

blue jean . 
"The consistent descriptions of 

the person and the mannerisms 
during the incidents led us to 
believe that this is the same per-
son," Floyd said. "It's pretty conÂ· 
sistent. And because it always hap-
pens on a Thursday, it seems to be 
the same person." 

"I don't know if he's a student 
or someone who is working in the 
area and was just given the oppor-
runity to come into the campus at 
those times, so it' hard to say if 
this person is a srudcnt or not," 
Floyd said. 

UCSD Police is asking anyone 
who has further information on the 
incidents to call a police dispatcher 
at (S5S) 534-4357. 

According to Floyd, students 
should immediately call the police if 
they experience a similar incident. 

"If you see the person, walk 
away; you don't want to engage the 
person in conversation," Floyd 
said. "If you happen to have a cell 
phone, you imm'ediately leave the 
area, go to a place of safety and 
give us a calL" 

Bond: Opponents crit~cize 
'matching funds' provision' 

continued from ~ 2 
Committee, in order to receive any 
money from the bond, local school 
districts are required to provide 40-
percent matching funds, unless they 
qualify for special state assistance. 

"Unless you live in a wealthy 
community with surplus cash for 
the required 4O-percent matching 
funds, you and your children may 
never see a penny from this $12.3 
billion bond," Oller said. 

Some students who will vote on 
March 2 said that California is in a 
state of debt and this 4O-percent 
matching funds stipulation pre-
sents difficulty for those who 
would otherwise support the bond 
issue. 

"The 4O-percent matching pro-
vision should be taken out of the 
proposal because if they are going 
to spend more deficit money on 
schooling, it should be equal 
opportunity spending, so that the 
stratifying division between the 
rich and the poor does not increase 
drastically," Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomore Wesley Chiu 

said. "They should spend the 
money as to the condition of the 
schools and whether or not the 
money is needed." 

Funds will subsidize the con-
struction of new schools and class-
rooms, as well as finance the pur-
chase and installation of air-condi-
tioning equipment and insulation 
materials, These include the pur-
chase of furnirure or equipment 
designed to increase safety, the 
assessment of hazardous asbestos 
and the funding for roof replace-
ment projects, according to 
Section lOOS29 of the bill outlin-
ing means for K-12. 

Revelle College freshman Zack 
Simltover said that improving the 
conditions for these educational 
facilities outweighs the impact it 
could have on the state deficit, 

"I am voting 'yes' on 
Proposition 55," Simlmver said. 
"We're always paying for taxes, 
and the whole purpose of taxes is 
to pay for social programs. We 
have to choose the one that means 
the most to us. ~

Aid: Change in allocation formula could affect UCSD UC Provost:

lenders when srudents default on 
their payments . Current law 
makes the fee optional. 

One critic of the proposal, Rep . 
George Miller (D-Calif.), argued 
before a House committee that the 
change would cost students an 
extra $40 billion nationwide over 
the next decade. 

Just days after the president 
announced his proposal, the 
California Student Aid Commission 
and its non-profit auxiliary EdFund, 
which administers the commission's 
guarantee program for the majority 
of srudent loans in the state, said it 
plans to waive the fee next year for 
the ninth year in a row as pan of 
their "No G-Fee" program. 

The commission cited rapidly 
increasing ruition fee as one of 
the factors for its decision, accord-
ing to spokesman Dana Callihan. 
It estimated the clan would save 
srudents as much' as $40 million 
next year, though the President's 
proposal would require EdFund to 
charge the fee. 

"It 's small - one percent per 
student - but we'd still rather see 
it in the pockets of students than in Â· 
somebody's coffers," said UCSD 
Director of Financial Aid Vincent 
De Anda , who sits on CSAC's loan 

advisory committee, 
EdFund provides the guarantee 

service for all student loans at 
UCSD, including the $70.3 mil-
lion students and their families 
took out during the 2002-03 
school year, according to De Anda, 
One percent of the amount would 
have cost them an extra $703,000. 

Smaller guarantee agencies say 
they must charge the fee to meet 
legal reserve limits and have lobbied 
to make the fee mandatory. They 
say the move is needed to preserve 
their solvency, National Council of 
Higher Education Loan Programs 
President Brett E. Lief told the 
Chronicle of Higher Education. 

Bush also proposed to keep the 
maximum Pell Grant, the largest of 
federal grants, at $4,050 for the 
third year in a row. Though his pro-
posal added more than $800 million 
in funding for the grants - most 
filling last year's deficit in the pro-
gram - it also forecasts that S,OOO 
fewer students would receive the 
grant and cuts the average award by 
$42, from $2,441 to $2,399. 

[n addition, the budget plan 
said the Pell Grant program would 
face a $3.7 billion deficit by the 
end of the year because of an unex-
pected surge in grant applicants.

the current amount of the grant is 
$500 smaller (han in 1975-76, 
despite sharp increases in ruition 
costs since then, Miller said. 

However, Bush called for an 
extra $33 million to add an addi-
tional $1,000 to grants of freshmen 
who take rigorous high school 
classes as part of the State Scholars 
program, in which 14 states partic-
ipate. California students would be Â· 
not eligible for the money because 
the state does not take part in the 
program. 

Bushs budget keeps funding for 
work-study and the Supplementary 
Educational Opportunity Grant at 
current levels and cuts all future 
contributions (0 the Perkins Loan 
program, under which universities 
act as the lender in providing low-
interest loans. He stated in the pro-
posal that universities have enough 
revolving funds from loan repay-
ments to continue me program

Bush also asked Congress to

government to fund the three 
"campus-based" programs, named '

grams goes to universities, which

long ago campuses began applying 
for the funding, with the newest 
schools missing out, a system the 
administration argued did not meet 
the needs of lowÂ·income students, 

The campus would probably 
lose money under the new alloca-
tion formula, De Anda said, 
because UCSD has participated in 
the programs for many years, 

As part of his proposal, Bush 
called on Congress to increase loan 
limits for freshmen from $2,625 to 
$3,000. The Iimi( had remained 
nearly unchanged since the 1970s. 

"We've been pushing for a 
higher level, especially for fresh-
men, because the costs have con-
tinued going up," De Anda said, 
explaining that he would have 
liked to see additional limits for all 
students. "We'd like to see that 
increased. It would help us a lot in 
our packaging policies, and I think 
it would help our packaging in 
general." Congress wi II decide on 
the president'S proposed funding 
levels when it approves next years 
budget. However, Congressional 
leaders will vote separately on actu-
al proposed changes to financial aid 
programs, including the loan guar-
antee fee, as part of their reautho-
rization of the Higher Education 
Act.

The Gigli Award: Gobble, gobble, 'Gigli' is a turkey of a film 
By JESSICA IIUSKAMP 

Senior Staff writer 

I did not want to rent Gigli. I feigned movie fines at every Blockbuster in the tri-county area 
to get out of renting it. So my fear-
less friend rented it for me, and that's 
when the rumon stirred to circulate. 
UPon verification that someone had, 
in fact, rented this film, six masochis-
tic people attended a bizarre event 
that sprung up from the deep shame 
that is "Gigli ." Thats right. We had 
ourselves a good. old-fashioned film 
screening. 

I'll say "film" for that extra-spe-
cial tOlK"h of irony. 

That fearless mend? He qualified 
his rental of "Gigli" by casually 

telling the Blockbuster employee 
that he was renting it for a school 
project. Hes fearless, but not dumb; 
no one wants to be associated with 
this film (though I admit I had a sick 
curiosity). The scariest part about 
this whole experience is that 
Blockbuster Guy said, "You know, it 
really was not that bad." 

OK, then. Maybe "Gigli" got a 
bad rap. Maybe the press and the 
critics and the Screen Actors Guild 
and the 153 or so people that actu-
ally paid to see it and the studio and 
everyone on earth just didn't get it 
and it was a fine cinematic achieve-
ment - just horrifically misunder-
stood. Blockbuster Guy was our 
beacon of hope, our ray of sunshine 
in the "Gigli" shadow. Could he be 

right? 
No. Definitely not. Blockbuster 

Guy, you sweet little man: You are 

" The scariest part about 
this whole experience is 
that Blockbuster Guy 

said, 'You know, it really 
~l _~ bad '" was not [f1Â£.U. â¢ . 

so far beyond wrong, it's hilarious. 
Blockbuster Guy apparently did-

n't need any sort of film-critiquing 

skill to work at the rental monolith 
because the film was bad. 
Embarrassingly bad. "Gigli" rhymes 
with "really" (as Ben Affleck, who 
plays Larry Gigli, said twice in the 
fint mind-melting 10 minutes of the 
film), and it was really, really bad. 

Did I mention it was bad} 
We were a twisted crowd that 

attended the screening. We knew 
it was probably going to elicit a 
few laughs and possibly a few jaw 
drops of disbelief, but it wasn't 
until someone read the movie case 
that we truly got the inkling that 
we were going to battle. 
Blockbuster had taken the liberty 
of suggesting other films we 
might take a liking to. 

It read, "Enjoy other such films 

as 'Darkness Fa lls' and 'Wrong 
Turn.'" 

It meant, "Since you are enjoy-
ing this shitty film, please rent 
these other shiny titles." 

And then we pressed play. 
I can honestly say I have no idea 

what "Gigli" is about. I do know that 
Gigli is played by Affleck (which was 
a surprise, since [ thought Gigli was 
the girl's name) and that Jennifer 
Lopezs character is named Michell e. 
Or Rochelle. Or wa it Ricki at some 
point? (Finding out her name is sup-
posed to be the last punchline in the 
film, but by that time, all hope was

~V\) Best One Liners: 
~ Old School 

Throughout cinema, some 
movies exi st to document a crucial, 
universally quotable line. From 
"Frankly my dear, J don't give a 
damn l" 10 the more recem "That 
Hansel's so hot right now," many 
pictures lend themselves to a par-
ticular line of script. 

Falling in line with this tradi-
tion, "Old School" proves Oscar-
worthy, offering up its script and 
sense of humor to socialites and 
film connoisseurs everywhere. 

"You're my boy, Blue!" may be 
the line to go down in film history 
as li nking words to cinematic won-
der, but this stands unjustifi ed. 

Courtesy of DrealllWOlks Pictures 

That line will suffice to let friends 
know that you've seen the movie, 
but it does not represent the char-
acter of the film's writing. 

"Old School" delights in sim-
ple phrases; interjecting a 
detached "I love you, Dad," in 
mid-conversation or describing a 
friend as "successful and disease-
free," one truly celebrates the bril-
liance of such speech. 

Don't limit these lines; cele-
brate every word.

~~ Ballsiest Movie: . 
~ Kill Bill Vol. 1 

Quentin Taranti no has never 
been one for simpl icity and mi ni-

Tarantino returned in O ctober 
with a bang, Ii tera ll y. So ri dicu -
lously over-the-top and almost 
comical, "Kill Bill Vol. I" jumped 
off of the screen and smacked 
viewers in the face . Audiences 
,vere bombarded with two hour 
of sen ory ove rl oad. As tri te as it 
sounds, "Kill Bill" was definitely 
one ha rdcore movie, and every-
one knew that U ma Thurman 
and Lucy Liu were girls you did -
n't want to piss off. 

This homage to Hong Kong 
kung fu fl icks, B-grade action films 
and manga comics delighted audi-
ences everywhere. Violent' Yes, it's 
filled wi th God-knows-how-many

would put your local blood bank to 
shame. C heesy one-liners? Yes, bur 
only Tarantino can really get away

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

~ C\,) Best Movie with Nailed European Men: 
~ 28 Days Later 

Touting a title that is apt to be 
confused with "28 Days," that 
Sandra Bullock film that some 
may find equally scary, "28 Days 
Later" stands out as a stark and 
frightening modern zombie film 
from critically acclaimed director 
Danny Boyle ("A Life Less 
Ordinary" and "Trainspotting"). 
Boyle is known for his bleak-yet-
gorgeous portrayals of skinny, 
desperate (most likely European) 
men like Ewan McGregor. 

The buzz surrounding this 
British film on its arrival to the 
United States early last year 
gave linle notice to the most 
important part of the film: a 
beautiful man who spends the 
first half of the film wander-
ing through the deserted 
Streets of London. If blood-
spewing, rabid brain-eating 
zombies aren't your palette, 
the film deserves a once-over 
just for the endearing charm 
of 29-year-old Irish actor 
Cillian Murphy ("Girl With A 

Pearl Earring"), who plays the 
beautiful man who wakes up 
from a coma (naked) to find 
himself one of the few survivors 

in a post-apocalyptic 
virus outbreak in 
London.

~ Best Movie Everyone Claims They Want to See: (Idade cit' Dell'> ((lty of God) 

Every pseudo-intellectual who 
claims to have decent taste in 
films has been exclaiming "I want 
to see 'City of God,''' but sadly, 
the actual number of people who 
have taken the ini ti ative to sec 
this srunning film are few. 
Instead, mediocre fodder such as 
"Euratrip," and "Confessions of a 
Teenage Drama Queen" end up 
topping lists of box office grosses. 
And that i truly a tragedy. 

Based on a true story, "Cidade 
de Deus" tells the story of a young 
photographer, Buscape (played 
with subtle yet touching realism by 
Alexandre Rodrigues), who nar-
rates the history of the Rio Dc 
Janiero slum, Cidade de Deus. 
Director Fernando Meirelles inge-

Coultesy of Miramar 

niously weaves interlocking stories 
to depict a breathtaking tale of 
crime, violence, fidelity, family and 
hope, all based on true events that 
occurred during the 19605 and 
'70s. 

"Cidade" encompasses all the 
traits necessary for an excellent 
film and and the extraordinary 
filmmaking has not gone unno-
ticed. With incredibly effective 
cinematography and touching 
music, Meirelles perfectly lav-
ishes his film with powerful 
details, horrific stories, humor-
ous observations and tragic 
emotions that are, in the end, 
simply unforgettable.

What would Seuss say to a tale 
that was mangled? 

Torn up, shattered and one 
that was tangled' 

A talc once beloved by those 
, young and those old 

Until Universal decided to 
withhold 

The magic and wonder that 
was in the book. 

Now, audiences turn away 
without even a look. 

Dr. Seuss was a childhood 
favorite until Bo Welch decided 
to make the good doctor spin in 
his grave by turning "The Cat in 
the Hat" into a live-action film. 
The film turned the Cat (Mike 
Myers) into a pervert, the daugh-
ter Sally (the robotic Dakota 
Fanning) into a neurotic obses-
sive-compulsive-style child and, 
in essence, spat on the entire 
boole. 

For those who don't remem-
ber the book, the plot ran as fol-
lows: two children are stuck in a 
house on a rai ny day when the Ca t 
comes to entertain them. The 
movie, however, eliminates the 
rainy day and the Cat teaches the 
dtildren a Very Special Lesson 
about ca ring for each otl1er as 
brother and sister. Not only that, 
the scriptwriters continue to devi-
ate from t11C rest of the book by 
having the chil dren leave the 
house, adding a creepy next-door 
neighbor ( Icc Baldwi n) and 
essentially removing the light-
hearted and innocent fee ling of 
the entire book. 

The final word: VVhen a movie 
fearures a cameo by Paris Hil ton 
at a rave, you know that your 
childhood memorie have been 
run over by the largest Hummer 
Hollywood could find .

~Horror Film. 

Darkness falls 
What is scary about "Darkness 

Falls" is what it told us about 
Hollywood and the American 
public. This tOoth fairy-driven 
horror tale was not only the worst 
horror film of 2003 , but quite 
possibly the worst film overall. 
Someone actually had the (ojolles 
to pitch this tooth fairy-gone-
mad screenplay, and it's even 
scarier that someone else had the 
cojonts to green-light it. 

It wasn't laughably bad nor 
was it scary, but the numbers tell 
us why this was the saddest film 
of the year. With a $7 million 
budget, this film debuted at 
number one and pulled in 532 
million. Unfortunately they had 
to spend 520 million convincing 
the American public that the 
tOoth fairy was actually scary. 
Strictly by the numbers, it is 
almost certain that an abomina-

way to theaters again soon. Do

Turkey time: 'Gigli' is unforgivable 
continued from page I I 

aquarium eat Gigli's boss' 
brain. There's that deadpan 
irony again! I lose my brain as 
I watch one get eaten. 
Brilliant.) 

Throw in some gang-
sters, a mentally challenged 
teenager kidnapped by Gigli, 
Ricki/Rochelle/Michelle/or 
something like that, her les-
bian lover and, for some 
inexplicable reason, AI 
Pacino (complete with a 
ponytail) and Christopher 
Walken - whose characters 
made no sense but they cat 
up 20 minutes of the film so 
it was OK - and you've got 
"Gigli." It's a dead-air, dead-
screen, dead-acting, dead-
writing, zero-chemistry, hor-
rid piece of film. 

There was that great yoga 
scene, though, where Lopez 
likens a vagina to a woman's 
mouth as she docs the down-
ward dog and other various 
yoga poses clearly choreo-
graphed to accentuate her 

gigantic asset. At first, it was 
the only redeeming scene of 
the film; we may be 
masochists but hey, we'll 
watch Jennifet Lopez do 

" There was that great 
yoga scene, though, 
where Lopez likens a 
vagina to a tooman's 

mouth," 
yoga. But then she started to 
talk. 

The dialogue was less 
than desirable in "Gigli ." 
Who reads "It's turkey time 
- gobble, gobble," in a 
script, knowing full well 
that the lines are written 
specifically about oral sex, 
and thinks" J must be in this 
film. " 

Well, Lopez did. "Gigli" 

was also a low-point for gay 
representation since it seems 
to tell audiences that even a 
lesbian (Yeah, Ricki is a les-
bian too) who pontificates 
about the beauty of a supple 
woman's body can't resist 
Affleck's mole-covered one. 

Affleck, his moles and his 
air-brushed tattoos got some 
of the worst lines in cinematic 
history (or best, depending if 
you are a glass-half-full sort of 
person). I had to watch him 
painfully utter, with humilia-
tion in his eye, words like: 
"Suck my dick dot com" 
(when he smashes a laptop 
over his knee), "dykasaurus 
rex," "stone-cold dyke," and 
other such gems. 

Writer/director Martin 
Brest, what were you think-
ing? Shame on you. Shame 
on you (but thank you, it 
broke up the monotonous 
mire) for reeling 
Christopher Walken and AI 
Pacino into your swamp. 

This film was Gigli bad.

~~ Worst Oscar Snub: 
~ Scarlett Johansson 

"Lost in Translation," 
which is up for four Oscars, 
tells the tory of a young 
woman and a middle-aged 
actor finding an unexpected 
bond while visiting Tokyo. 
The young woman in ques-
tion is played superbly by 
ScarlettJohansson, who con-
sistently plays older women 
(she's 18 playing a 20-some-
thing) due to her uncanny 
maturity and approachable-
yet-extraordinary beauty. 

VVhile other actresses 
packed on the pounds 
(Charlize Theron), forwent 
makeup (Naomi Watts) or 
tore into juicy comedic roles 
(Renee Zellwegger), 
Johansson was left with the 
difficul t task of showing the 
underlying pain and insecuri-
ty of a young woman search-
ing for her purpose in life 
without resorting to angry 
explosions or tearful break-
downs. Instead, Johansson 
holds her own alongside Bill 
Murray through the use of 

subtle glances and dry wit. 
While Murray is 

deservedly up for Best 
Actor, Johansson's name is 
sadly missing from the Best 
Actress nominee list. Her 
role in "Translation" is the 
kind that actually comple-
ments the lead, offering 
counterpoints and remain-

CoInsy of roo. feAns 
ing visible without taking 
center stage. Johansson is 
less dynamite in the role 
and more like a slow-burn-
ing fire, not as noticeable as 
other scene-stealing sup-
porting roles, but every bit 
as affecting.

~ Most Ambiguously Pornographic Titles 
Put your mind in the gutter and 

2003 's film titles sound nastier than 
X-Tina's "dirrty" laundry. 

Starting with the Oscar nomi-
nees, there's "Master and 
Commander," "Big Fish" and 
"Whale Rider" (those should all be 
fairly obvious). You'll have to use 
your imagination to make the rest 
of them work. There's "The 
Human Stain," "The Italian Job," 
"Incredible Hulk," "From Justin to 
Kelly," "2 Fast 2 Furious," "Bad 
Santa," "My Boss' Daughter," 
"Stuck On You" and "Dirty Pretty 
Things." 

When it comes down to it, any 
film title can be sullied if you've gOt 
your dirty thinking cap on. A 
GlIal'dian staff meeting revealed 
these additional titles ; "Finding 
Nemo," "Cat in the Hat," "T3: Rise 
of the Machines," "K.1ngaroo Jack" 
and "Freaky Friday." But "Girl With 
the Pearl Earring"? "Lara Croft 
Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"?

~ V\l Sequels That Should Not 
~ Have Been Made 

They say that things get better 
the second time around. What a 
load of self-delusional crap. 2003 
was full of sequels and prequels 
that should not have been made, 
some of the worst films being 
"Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life," 
"Dumb and Dumberer," "Matrix 
Reloaded," "Matrix Revolutions," 
"American Wedding," "George of 
the Jungle 2," "Final Destination 
2," and "Legally Blonde 2: Red, 
White and Blonde." 

This long list of films only 
goes on to prove that the 
movie industry will go to 
any lengths t9. bank on 
a good idea, even if they 
have to drag, stretch 
and beat it to death. 
Of the many prob-
lems these 
sequels have in 
common, one 
is the con-
tri ved plot. 
From 
side-story 
homosexual 

dogs in "Legally Blonde 2," to 
the weak story line of "Tomb 
Raider," the plots of these movies 
simply failed to deliver. These 
feeble attempts to recapture what 
the original movies once had, 
instead of slcillfully building upon 
the original idea, translate into 
some very appalling sequels -
you'd be wise and very lucky to 
stay away from them.

~ 6\'; Best Male Version of 'Sister Ad 2': 
~ School of Rock 

The day has come for the Best 
Male Version of "Sister Act 2" to 
be recognized: "School of Rock." 

Its all mere: disgruntled chil-
dren tired of conformity and look-
ing for a new instructor to tum 
things around, the down-and-out 
teacher who is a t a crossroads in his 
life and ready to make a change and, 
sure enough, the magical perfor-
mance at me end that makes up for 
all the havoc that Jack Black 
wreaked on his pupils. Sure, 

"School of Rock" is superior to 
most films in terms of quality, but 
surprisingly enough, it down plays 
similarities to "Sister Act 2," me 
movie that brought us out of reces-
sion and filled our bellies with a 
plate of soul and a side order of 
hope. Although Whoopi Goldberg 
does not appear in this movie, it is 
safe to say that Jack Black would 
look quite dashing in a habit.

One can hardly go wrong witll 
a movie about a horse, right? 
Perhaps, but this year's big horse 
movie, "Seabiscuit," was definitely 
not one of the best movies of fhe 
year and should not have been 
nominated for an Oscar, especially 
when there were many orner films 
that were far superior. 

Now, "Seabiscuit" was not a 
bad movie by any means. Not at 
all. The acting was 'quite good and 
the story was touching, but even 
so, the film was too far-reaching 
and is not what the G7Ia1"llian 
deems to be "Oscar material." 
How can one filmmaker truly cap-
ture the spirit of a nation during a 
time of depression, a horse, its 
owner, its trainer and iis jockey 
and still hope to be cohesive at the 
end? 

How could "Seabiscuit" be 
nominated for an Oscar when films 
like "In America" or "Whale 
Rider," which were infinitely more 
original and more sensitive in their 
emotional pleas, go unnoticed? And 
then how could others like "Big 
Fish," which had extraordinary cin-
ematography, be ignored in favor of 
tlle cliched historical-info-pic film-
ing techniques used in "Seabiscuit," 
which can be seen on any History 
Channel special.

Jesus and Mary Chain and Air, me 
movie simply would not be the same 
without this compilation of eclectic 
artists. Let's face it, without me 
music, "Lost in Translation" would 
be a completely different movie. 
The tunes aren't simply background 
music; mey truly have a role in me 
movie. From Kevin Shield's haunt-

ing tunes to the lcitschy, campy J-pop 
tunes of Kaze Wo Atsumete, 
Coppola has arranged a collection of 
music mat goes hand-in-hand beau-
tifully with the movie, just as Bill 
Murray and Scarlet Johans on's 
characters accompany. each other 
through the streets of Tokyo.

I don't remember what was 
going on in my life when I saw 
this film, but something possessed 
me to give "The Matrix 
Revolutions" four stars. My edi-
tors scratched their heads and 
printed it; after three years of 
writing for the Guardia", I had 
garnered my share of respect. 

Those were good times. 
Now most of my reviews are 

adjusted by what the Guardian calls 
"tlle Bynum correction." It's a com-
plicated formula that I don't under-
stand, but the ceiling is three-and-a-
half stars and the floor is two-and-a-
hal f. The pride-jol t isn't the worst 
part. The hardest part is trying to 
sleep at night knowing that 10, 
maybe even 20, of you saw tlle 
"Revolutions" on my recommenda-
tion. That's the tough part of being 
a critic. TIlats the tough part of 
wallcing down the street. 

God, I'm sorry.

You may think that Morgan 
Freeman nying a fighter jet and 
savi ng the planet from blood-
sucking aliens would make any 
movie successful, but sadly, noth-
ing can save the laughable disaster 
that is "Dreamcatcher." The 
movie plays as if Lawrence 
Kasdan broke out the Jack 
Daniels, got totally shit-faced, 
then cried out, "Let's make a pic-
ture!" This movie reeks of un fi n-
'ished plot, pitiful acting and aliens 
with British accents. 

After starting with some coher-
ent dialogue, the movie quickly 
spins out of control and unveils a 
whole range of absurd characters 
that leave audiences squealing as 
they drag the movie into uncharted 
tr.1gedy. 

The climax of the movie is the 
grand finale, where the main char-
acter is able to shoot down me glo-
rious Morgan Freeman in his enor-
mous plane with nothing more 
than a small hand gun. By the end 
of the movie, your brain is so fried 
you are convinced you're' the ' vil-
lain.

QUALCOMM 

Slcimming the list of all-star~ 
that appear on the soundtrack to 
"Barbershop 2," the compilation 
doesn't seem promising. . 

Anything that involves 50 Cent 
typically assures mediocrity. In 
"Unconditionally," 50 Cent per-
forms with G-Unit and sounds like 
he is rapping with his mouth wired 
shut. The track's infectious melody 
and beat can't help its trite lyrics 
and lack of heart. 

Giving 50 a run for his money, 
the soundtrack also features an 
appearance by Sean Paul, whose 
awful robotic renditions of reggae 
stand untouched. 

However, these appearances 

If you have or expect to have a 
cold this winter, buy the sound-
track to "Cold Mountain." You 
will be one of many, because not 
only is "Cold Mountain" nominat-
ed for an Oscar for best score, but 
the soundtrack is also being 
snatched from store shelves about 
as fast as Nyquil and Kleenex in 
the middle of February. 

That probably has something 
to do with the fact that "Cold 
Mountain" has a shiveringly good 
soundtrack. It aches in all the right 
places. It shuffles and soars and 
moans and forgives Jack White for 
all the dumb things he's done since

THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 26, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 19 

Muzak of our lives: Divine 'intervention or self-neurosis? 
short ki 
are cool 

Jessica Kruskamp 

Muzak. It's that canned, piped-in keyboard version of 
"Muskrat Love" that's played 

in the background of bleak offices, 
awkward elevator situations and 
white-knuckled dentist visits. It's 
lovably horrible, and though it 
often goes unnoticed, it's the 
score to these days of our lives. 

I, however, use the term 
"Muzak" loosely, fully utilizing 
any sort of artistic license that I 
may have earned. It's my personal, 
all -inclusive word for any back-
ground music that's often forgot-
ten and uncelebrated (especially if 
one is inebriated, but I'll get to 
that later) . 

It 's plain and simple: Muzak 
doesn't get its proper recognition. 
Whether its some divine music-
god intervention , or just some 
over-analyzation by yours truly, it 
happens. Muzak plays an ironic or 
meaningful role in most situations. 
Case in point: the weekend I just 

The camera pans over a teenage 
girl with very large breasts, wear-
ing a thin t-shirt, deep in thought. 
Suddenly, out of a sheer impulse 
she yells, "Wait, so Jason died by 
water and Freddy by fire?" Quite 
an astute observation - thanks for 
the input. 

Don't expect dark, scary alley-
ways and hell-raising horror in this 
film . The actors and actresses sure 
are hot, but who would want to 
miss Jason with Freddy in a head-

lock~ As a bonus, "Freddy vs , 
Jason" adds Kelly Rowland /Tom 
Destiny's Child as a token cameo. 

Failing miserably at its attempts 
to spook the audience, this hilari-
ous excuse for a horror flick lacks 
all the conventions of a horror 
film. As the movie travels down a 
road of various wet t-shirt scenes to 
an ultimate climax of Freddy 
elbow-dropping Jason as he yells 
"Why won 't you die,"'one learns to 
almost enjoy this film as a hidden 
comedy. 

-VuMai 
Staff Writ" 

spent in Las Vegas, complete with 
25 people crammed into two 
rooms. 

(Ibis is where the music and the 
inebriation comes in.) 

That's right, 25 bodies gener-
ating way too much heat and way 
too much stuff, in two rooms. 
Rock-star style all the way, and of 
course music highlighted the most 
momentous parts of the whirl-
wind 48 hours. Consider the time 
some members of the group par-
ticipated in beer bong activities 
and smoked cigarettes with the 
Strokes playing in the back-
ground. The Strokes, the same 
band that smokes and drinks on 
stage, Get it? 

(Music and alcohol. How else 
were we supposed to be happy 
about sleeping in our clothes on a 
hotel room floor? Or spooning 
with people one wouldn 't normally Â· 
spoon with?) 

After seven hours of traffic, 
most of the group arrived in Vegas 
ready to eat their own arms. Bottles 
in hand, and with confirmation that 
the all -night dining establishment, 
the Sherwood Cafe, did in fact 
serve beer, we settled down to a 
meal that included onl y a 20-per-
cent gratuity. Of course, no one 
paid much attention at the time to 

the fine muzak, though I distinctly 
remember shimmying and lip-
synching to Deep Blue Something's 
"Breakfast at Tiffany's." 

"Breakfast." It didn't strike me 
then, but I get it n07Jl. It was 3 a,m. 
We were eating. Hey, 1 napped in 
the car. I may be stretching here, 

" , .. what about sitting at 
the bar at O'Shea's with 
Britney Spearsi 'Toxic' 

ringing in my ears? 
0' Shea's is no BeUagio 

and I don't think it tries to 
be; it knows its place in 

the world." 

and my lovely $4 cup of cream of 
potato soup certainly isn't a 
Carnation Instant Breakfast, but I 
figured it loosely translates into 
the first and most important meal 
of that day. 

While "Tiffany" doesn 't factor 

much (OK, at all) into this equa-
tion, the music gods clearly sent 
us that song. And thus began a 
weekend full of muzakal gems that 
I didn't even realize were 
bestowed until now. 

When five of the men on the 
trip decided, in a moment of 
sobriety, that it would be a good 
idea to go-kart race, muzak was 
there. Watching them decked out 
in helmets and full red or blue race 
suits - this was some serious go-
karting - I felt like I should have 
been wearing a t-shirt with L'1e 
sleeves cut off, watching 
NASCAR. With th.e American flag 
and miscellaneous sponsor signs 
hung throughout the warehouse 
that contained the race track, Van 
Halen blared out of speakers that 
seemed to be precariously 
a ttached to the walls. 

It's no "Sweet Home Alabama" 
by Lynryd Skynrd, but that would 
just be too obvious. It's all about 
understatement and subtlety, folks. 
It's that hard, classic rock sound 
that makes me think of fast cars, 
feathered hair and down-home 
country fun like go-kart r;cing. 

If that's not a strong enough 
message, what about sitting at the 
bar at O'Shea's with Brimey 
Spears' "Toxic" ringing in my ears? 

O'Shea 's is no Bellagio and I don't 
think it tries to be; it knows its 
place in the world. Britney 
"singing" a song titled "Toxic" at a 
place tllat served beer in plastic 
cups for $2 and half-pound hot 
dogs just makes sense. The casino 
and the music were cheap, arguably 
noxious and the yin to the other's 
yang, 

Insert a favorite bad hip-hop 
song into the next episode on this 
Las Vegas odyssey, and you will 
practically be there with us. At first 
I'm happily trudging up the strip, 
then the next thing I know we're 
rolling down Las Vegas Boulevard 
in a stretch SUV limousine. In that 
moment, with the hip-hop song so 
loud I couldn't figure out what it 
was, I became everyone I hate. But 
it's acceptable. The muzak was so 
perfect, it made it acceptable. What 
else should you be listening to, rid-
ing in such a ride, in such a place as 
Vegas (baby), 

And, finally, the car ride home. 
It was on a mix CD, and it wasn't 
even a mix I made (hell, I wasn't 
even in the same car, but r heard 
about it later) , but Phantom 
Planet's "California" was on. 
Headed right back to where we 
started /Tom, the Vegas odyssey was 
complete.

Tennis: Swatt solitary UCSD singles winner 
cominued from page 24 

choke-it chance." 
The Tritons did take the dou-

bles point of the match, putting 
them at an early advantage over 
the Aztecs. 

"The doubles point was fun to 
get," Steidlmayer said. "SDSU's 
No. I team was ranked ninth in 
Division ) in the country, and 
Jeff and Sameer certainly played 
well to get that. At No. 2 we 
played aggressively, moved bet-
ter than our opponents, and gave 
ourselves a good chance for vic-
tory." 

Hardt and Redondo's loss 
resulted in a drop in their rankings 
from No.9 to No. 30 in Division I. 

No. 3 doubles, sophomore 
Brent Molden and senior Nick 
Morton, were defeated by San 
Diego State's Daniel Jung and 
Dontia Hayes. 

UCSD started off solidly in 
singles with Nejad and Swatt tak-
ing the first set at No. 6 and No. 2 
singles, respectively, and Molden 
erving for the first-set at No.5. 

However, Molden's opponent, 
Michael Coehlo, fought to win 
the first set tiebreaker and never 
looked back. And at No. I, No. 3 
and No.4 singles, Chopra, sopho-
more Emil Novak and Wilson 
struggled and lost their first sets to 
the Aztecs. 

"I just had no rhythm in my 
si ngles match," Wilson said. 
"Daniel Jung is a good player bur 
has the weirdest game; he's what 
you call a 'junk baller, ' and he was 
just hard to attack." 

The lone singles victory for 
UCSD came from Swatt, who i.s 
ranked No. 17 in Division II. He 

played one of the best matches of 
his career against Redondo, 
whom Swatt remembers as the 
best player in southern 
California from when they were 
younger. He took Redondo by 
surprise, winning the first set 
quickly, 6-3. Swatt ended up 
dropping the second set, 4-6, but 
battled back to win the third, 
playing solidly, fighting for every 
point and frustrating his oppo-
nent. 

"I stayed focus and played my 
game the whole match," Swatt 
said. "My nerves got the best of 
me in the second set, but I fought 
through it." 

. Steidlmayer was pleased with 
Swatts performance, citing that 
his hard work in practice paid off. 

"Bryan has been working at 
his game for seven weeks, with-
out a lot of positive results, but 
with persistence and determina-
tion," he said. "I was happy for 
him that he was able to get two 
great results today. That was 
awesome!" 

San Diego State got the better 
of UCSD in singles - winning 
five of six matches - but the 
Tritons made them earn the wins, 
forcing four of the matches to 
three sets . Molden and Chopra 
were also struggling through their 
matches with nagging injuries. 

"Definitely, singles was tough," 
Steidl mayer said. "But we played 
to three sets in three losses and 
one win, so definitely we feel we 
were in the match. The injuries 
suffered are a part of the game and 
we probably just need to learn 
how to deal with those better." 

Although the Tritons lost, 
their competitive play against 
their Division I opponent was a 
confidence booster that they 
hope will aid them in their 
tougher Division II matches 
coming up in the schedule, 
namely Florida Gulf Coast and 
top ranked Hawaii Pacific. 

UCSD plays its next matches on 
March 6 against Sonoma State at 9

singled, Hernandez singled, and 
Riddle walked to load the bases 
for the Tritons. Junior third 
baseman Ricky Pinocchio pro-
vided a one-out groundout to 
score one run, and junior desig-
nated hitter Josh Saunders deliv-
ered a two-out single to bring in 
two more. 

UCSD put up its final three 
runs in the top of the eighth to 
secure the victory over the 
Coyotes. . 

The Coyotes put up their 
th ree runs in the bottom of the 
fifth inning off of UCSD starter 
Bergstrom. Triton junior pitcher 
Logan Boutilier came on in relief 
for Bergstrom in the fifth and 

continued his phenomenal start 
to the 2004 season. With a 
Wilson California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Pitcher of 
the Week award and a seven-
inning complete game in his first 
career start already under his belt 
for 2004, Boutilier got out of the 
fifth and proceeded to frustrate 
Coyote batters over the next 
three innings, allowing just two 
hits while striking out five . 
Boutilier earned the victory for 
UCSD and improved to a perfect 
3-0. 

Hernandez finished 3-for-5 
while Saunders and Clark had 
two hits apiece for UCSD. 

The Tritons notched 13 hits 
as a team compared to six by the 

Coyotes. 
UCSD will begin a four-game 

conference series with Cal Poly

continued from page 24 
finishing in first place and shooting 
rounds of 74,68 and 6S, for a total 
of 207, nine under par. 

") actually started off playing 
below average," Duckworth said. 
"Somewhere in the middle of the 
second round though, the flood 
gates opened, and birdies just start-
ed pouring out. I was 20 strokes 
better in the second half than in the 
first. My performance was due in 
large part to incredible coaching 
from Coach Wydra." 

Senior team captain Alan Scheer 
came in second for UCSD and tied 
for 18th in the tournament, putting 
together round totals of 73,68 and 
74 for a final score of 21S, one 
under par. 

"First off, congratulations to 
Brian, he played great today. It 
was unfortunate that we couldn't 
help him out more in the final 
round, but we still beat some great 
teams," Scheer said. "Our second 
round was really eye-opening, and 
gives us the respect we need to 
make it to the nationals ." 

Sophomore Justin Grant 
placed third for the Tritons and 
tied for 34th in the invitational 
with rounds of 74, 70 and 75, giv-
ing him 219 overall, three over 
par. 

"We're playing really well 
right now," Grant said. "I had a 
lot of birdie opportunities in the 
first 36 holes and sunk seven, but 

I should've made more. 
Unfortunately, I started [Feb. 24) 
with a triple bogey." 

Fourth for the Trirons was fel-
low sophomore Robbie Kramer, 
whose rounds of 76, 69 and 79 
gave him a total of 224, eight over 
par. He tied for 5 Jrd in the invita-
tional. 

"This year our team has made 
a huge leap from last year," 
Kramer said. "Before, we were 
always trying to break 300, but 
now we just finished 13 under par 
on Tuesday, and we're just a lot 
more consistent. We're almost 
always in the 60s and lo~ 70s. For 
myself, I played well in the first 
two rounds, but I struggled off the 
tee and in the bunkers. n 

Junior Joe Dolby rounded up 
the squad for UCSD, tying for 57th 
in the tournament with rounds of 
7 S, 71 and 79, giving him a score of 
225, nine over par. 

lilt's great to have Brian play-
ing so well right now, it's like 
playing with a celebrity," Dolby 
said . "I was not very happy with 
my final round, I putted very 
p09r1y, but I hope I can play bet-
ter next time to contribute in my 
role as one of 'the big three' on 
the team." 

UCSD is back on the links on 
Feb. 28 and Feb. 29 when it plays 
in the Aztec Invitational at Lake 
San Marcos CountrY Club in San 
Marcos, Calif. 

Water polo: Tritons drop championship match to San Diego State, 6 .. 3 
continued from page :l4 

overall record against conference 
opponents, including tournament 
matches. 

Despite the finish, the Tritons 
proved in the second period that 
they could hold their own without 
luck. Down 2-1 after seven minutes, 
the Triton offense awoke from its 
slumber, scoring two goals -
including one on a six-an-five 
opportuni ty - to draw the teams 
even at 4-4. 

Then, with 20 seconds left in 
the half, junior driver Jessica Wong 
broke away on a counterattack and 
scored to give the 1ritons a 4-3 
lead at the half, swinging the 
momentum their way and silencing 
the Aggie faithful. 

Lyman earned a hat trick, her 
first as a Tri ton, while Bantilan-
Smith scored two and junior driver 
Jaemi J ackson added one goal to 
the effort. Tiffany Hodgens led the 
Aggies with three goals, while 
Bri ttany Rus ell scored two and 
Crisara Adams contributed one. 

More important than the score-
line itself was the fact that UCSD 
was able to remain in contention 
after being down early. In their pre-

vious losses, the Tritons have had a 
tendency to go down early and play 
catch-up for the rest of the game. 

Against UC Davis, however, 
head coach Larry Sanders credited 
his team for shaking the habit. 

"We were being patient and not 
getting frustrated, executing the 
right defenses, loolcing for deeper 
opportunities, and scoring when we 
needed to," Sanders said. "We're 
steadily progressing with experi-
ence," 

UCSD finished 2-0 on Feb. 21, 
the first day of the UC Davis 
Shootout, having rolled over UC 
Santa Cruz, 14-4, earlier in the day. 
Oncc again, Bantilan-Smith and 
Lyman led the UCSD scoring, tally-
ing four and three goals on the stat 
sheet, respectively. Emily Erskines 
three goals for the Banana Slugs 
were little consolation in a game 
where the Tritons raced out to a 7-2 
lead at the half and an 11-3 margin 
by the fourth period. The early dis-
play of firepower allowed Sanders to 
make constant substitutions and rest 
the starters for the UC Davis game. 

On Feb. 20 against No. 12 San 
Jose State, the 'tritons displayed 
persistence in the face of defeat, 

going down 2-0 early in the first 
pe.riod but surging back to take a 4-
3 win. 

UCSD junior utility Courtney 
Clevenger responded to the two 
goals scored by San Jose State's 
Deanna Lowry, notching a point of 
her own to cut the Spartan lead in 
half. The Tritons wrestled control of 
the match away from San Jose State 
by scoring three goals in the third, 
including two from Bantilan-Smith, 
who hit the back of the cage with 
1:48 left to put the Tritons up for 
good at 4-2 . 

From there, UCSD stepped up 
the defense, taking its first substan-
tial comeback win of the season, and 
discovering a newfound confidence 
that would only whet the appetite 
for continued success in Davis. 

"The San Jose State game was a 
big one for our confidence," 
Lombardo said. "It was a big deal for 
all of us because we were determined 
and kept our heads in the game." 

Working on a "high confidence 
level," the Tritons took little time 
to assert their first-place aspira-
tions on Feb. 22, dismissing No. 15 
Arizona State, 3 -1, in a battle of 
defensive wits and offensive 

malaise. The Tritons had .many 
opportunities to extend their mar-
gin of victory, but stumbled to the 
finish, shooting only 3-for-23. 

Clevenger picked up a deuce, 
while Bantilan-Smith nailed her 
ninth goal of the weekend. 
Lombardo also racked up nine saves. 

Defensively, however, the Tritons 
matched the Sun Devils stroke-for-
stroke, moving up aDd down the 
pool with speed and limiting ASU to 
only one goal and exacting revenge 
for an 8-3 defeat at the Michigan 
Invitational earlier in the season. 

Still, Sanders was pleased with 
tbe results, favoring a sports mantra 
of persistence over statistics. 

"It's like that Byron Scott article 
from the '80s: 'Shoot 'em up, or 
~Ieep in the street,'" Sanders said. 
"I stressed this to the girls ... If 
you 're in a slump, you keep shoot-
ing out of it." 

The win, coupled with San 
Diego State's 9-4 success over the 
Sun Devils, set up a final show-
down against the No. 5 Aztecs for 
the championship match. In their 
fifth and final game of a long week-
end, the Tritons seemed dormant 
and flustered by the crosstown 

rivals, evident in the Aztl!cs' 5-1 
lead at the end of the third . 

"We weren't recognizing the 
best opportunities," Sanders said. 
"We'd get off a deflected shot, put 
35 more seconds on the shot clock, 
move things and take a shot with 30 
seconds left on the clock instead of 
using all that time." 

The Triton offense stirred 
enough in . the fourth quarter to 
mount an attack, cutting the lead to 
5-3, but fell short in the end, set-
tling for second place. 

Lyman and freshman two-meter 
players Natalie Hockett and Rachel 
Bender each broke through to 
score in the loss. 

"Winning would have been the 
icing on the cake," Sanders said. 
"Bur I challenged the girls to come 
out fighting in the fourth, and I was 
proud of the finish." 

UCSDs focus now is on improv-
ing their consistency in preparation 
for Stanford, their first opponent at 
the UC Santa Barbara Gaucho 
Invitational on Feb. 28 and Feb. 29. 

"We figured out this weekend 
that we like to Will games." 
Lombardo said, "And we're not 
going back to losing." 

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 26. 2004 

Women's rugby 
Halfway through its regular sea-

son, the UCSD women's rugby 
team remained undefeated after a 
23- 10 win over a visiting Arizona 
State squad on Feb. 7. Playing in 
front of a crowd of family and 
friends, UCSD came out quick and 
strong, leaping to an early lead. 

A high-pressure' offense com-
bined with junior Kirstin Hartos' 
accurate kicking kept the score-
board in the Tritons' favor. Defense 
was led by senior Jolene Sawyer, 
who alone was making most of the 
big tackles that kept ASU from 
advancing the ball. 

UCSD looks to reaffirm its 
dominance in the next two weeks, 
with league matches against ASU 
on March 6 and the University of 
Arizona on March 7. A second 
match against UC Santa Barbara in 
early April will also be important in 
determining who goes on to 
nationals. As the fourth-ranked 
team in the nation, UCSD will ' 
strive to. make the cut for nationals. 

Ultimate 
The UCSD Psychos are at it 

again. After winning the national 
title two years ago, the UCSD 
women's ultimate team began 
rebuilding itself with new faces and 
fresh talent. 

And if this past weekend's resul ts 
were any indication, another crown 
may be bestowed in the near future . 
On Feb. 15 and Feb. 16, the 
Psychos were nearly flawless, 
sweeping the UCSD-hosted 
President's Day Tournament. 

Teams competing in the three-
day rournament included UC 
Berkeley, Texas, UC Sant2 Cruz, 
UC Davis, Oregon, Stanford, Duke, 
University of British Colombia, UC 
Santa Barbara, Wisconsin, 
Colorado, NOrthwestern, Arizona 
and two squads from UCSD. 

The Psychos breezed through 
games on Feb. IS, going 3-0. On

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

I CLUB SPORTS 
Feb. 16, their opponents averaged a 
mere 2.75 points per game. In 
playoff competition, they defeated 

UC Santa Barbara and UBC 
before trouncing UC 
Berkeley in the finals, 15 -8. 

The women have a 
short break before 
competing at the 
Stanford Invite 
where they hope to 
duplicate their suc-

cess. 
In men's play, 
thirty teams . 

from around 
the nation traveled to 

compete at the tournament. 
UCSD had two squads competing 
against some of the best players 
around. Overall, the Air Squids 
went 8-2, beating Rice, Humboldt, 
Texas A&M, University of 
Washington, George Washington, 
Dartmouth, Oregon State and 
regional rivals UC Santa Barbara. 
Huge offensive and defensive plays 
by Chris "Phelps" Darrouzet-
Nardi helped the Squids get to the 
quarterfinals. 

Both teams will travel to 
Stanford in March to compete in 
the similarly competitive Stanford 
Invite. 

Equestrian 
The UCSD equestrian team, 

holding its top position in the 
regional point rankings, hosted an 
English show this past weekend at 
the indoor arena at Del Mar 
Horsepark. Although it was the first 
time the team had the opportunity 
to compete indoors, UCSD placed 
third on Feb. 21 and was crowned 
reserve champions on Feb. 22. 

In the open Oat and fences divi-
Sian, Linda Torres placed high in 
the ribbons along with captain Kate 
McComas, who took home the 
reserve champion ribbon for indi-
vidual highpoint rider .on Feb. 2Z. 
In the intermediate division, junior 
Kayti Mathewson and captain 
Marce Evans trounced the compe-
tition, taking first and second on 
Feb. 21, and first and third on Feb. 
22, respectively. In the Novice divi-
sion, Casey Kohler, Kathryn 
Panian, Fiona McKenna, Morgan 
. Messing and Zoe Jarocki all rode 
and placed well. 

Advanced Walk-Trot-Canter 
riders Shannon Ward, Amy 
Hilleman and Kellie Davis also put 
in great rides with Shannon Ward 
and Amy HiUeman placing first and 
second on Feb. 22. Beginning 
Walk-Trot-Canter rider Jessica 
Gorton placed second and fourth, 
respectively and new member 
Allison Cleary placed third both 

days. The equestrian team's star 
Walk-Trot riders Allison 
Henderson and Lindee Hamner 
placed fourth and sixth on Feb. 21, 
and second and sixth on Feb. 22, 
respectively. 

The equestrian team will com-
pete next at a show co-hosted by 
USC and UCLA on March 6 an~ 
March 7. 

Men's lacrosse 
The No. 24 UCSD men's 

lacrosse team evened its season 
record to 2 -2 after a strong win 
over division rivals UCLA. With 
two minutes, 15 seconds left in the 
game, UCSD's attackrnan Nick 
Dean scored to break a 9-9 tie 
brought on by a late game rally by 
the Bruins. 

Conting off of a win over UC 
Berkeley and a sliin loss to No. 3 
Sonoma State, UCSD was looking 
for another victory against the 
Bruins. After controlling much of 
the first half, the Tritons were 
outsCored 6-4 in the second half as 
the UCLA goalie made some saves 
and the Bruins counterpunched to 
overcome a three-goal deficit and 
tie the game, 9-9, late in the fourth 
quaner. 

The game was characterized by 
long offensive possessions by 
UCSD and a stilling defensive 
scheme by UCLA. With seven 
phlyers scoring 10 goals and a 70-
percent assist rate, UCSD dis-
played a balanced and controlled 
offense that allowed all starting 
attackmen to get both goals and 
assists as four of the top six rnid-
fielders also scored. 

Defensively, Brandon Hays 
played an exceptional first half that 
helped keep the Bruins to only 
three goals. Additionally, freshman 
defenseman Eric Zirgulis rose to 
the occasion by holding UCLAS 
explosive attackman Andrew So to a 
single goal, one which he earned 
when Zirgulis was forced to switch 
to another player. Defensive rnid-
fielder Tim Cheng also had an 
impressive showing as he helped 
captain several successful rides and 
key defensive stops late in the game 
when UCLA was desperately 
attacking the goal in an effort to 
force overtime . 

The game ball went to Mike 
Albani, who displayed much need-
ed leadership and patience on the 
offensive end of the field, as well as 
winning three of four face-offs. 
The team will have a busy week, 
with a trio of games against 
University of San Diego, Loyola 
Marymount and Northeastern.

Tritons place fifth at Family Motors Invitational, set record 
UCSD golf's Brian Duckworth takes first place overall at Seven Oaks Country Club 

By JOE SPANO

TheUCSD

fifth in a field

Brian 
Duckworth 

In the second round on Feb. 23 , 

UCSD put together a team total of 
27 5, not only the lowest score in 
head coach Mike Wydra's tenure as 
a coach, but the lowest team score 
in the Triton's history. In their 
impressive showing, the Tritons 
fell just one stroke short of a tour-
nament record. 

"Thirteen under par would 
hold up against most Division I 
teams," Wydra said. "We scored a 
276 ' in fall in the Western 
Washington Invitational, which 
was nice to let everyone know that 
we're capable of such things, but 
we g t everyone's attention again 
with this 275. We're really estab-
lishing ourselves as a team you'd 

like to have in the national cham-
pionships." 

Though the Tritons struggled a 
bit in the first round on Feb. 23, 
shooting a team score of 296, they 
more than made up for it in the 
next round. 

"Seven Oaks is a composite 
course," Wydra said. "They added 
nine new holes to an existing 
course, so many of the holes have a 
different look and playability, and 
even different designers. However, 
for the most part, it is not an over-
ly difficult course, even though it is 
fun to play on a course where you 
can do very well and produce some 
low scores." 

Team scores for a round are 
based on a team's four best scores, 
which result in the dropping of the 
Â·fifth player's score. During their 
275 round, UCSD dropped a score 
of 71, or one under par. 

"When you shoot a score like 
27 5, everyone wonders what the 
score you dropped was. It has been 
one of my goals as a coach to drop 
a score of par, but this round we 
actually managed to drop a score 
below par," Wydra said. 

The Tritons put together a 293 
for their final round on Feb. 24, 
giving them an even-par grand 
totaJ of 864 for the tournament.

Men's tennis downed by Aztecs, 5-2 
UCSD records two doubles victories against Div. I San Diego State 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's tennis team, 
currentJy ranked 12th in Division 
II, traveled across town on Feb. 
24 to face Division I San Diego 

tate with nothing to lose and 
everything to gain. Although the 
Aztecs edged the Tritons, 5-2, 
UCSD earned the respect of 
SDSU with two big wi ns in dou-
bles and solid play by jun ior 
Bryan Swan in singles. 

"Our team played solidly 
today," UC D head coach Eric 
Steidlmayer said . "1 think that 
ome players played well , some 

very well , and others a bit below 
average. On the whole, it was a 
good performance." 

At No. 2 doubles, senior Arnir 
Nejad and Swan paired up to beat 
Markus Dickhardt and Michael 
CoehJo by a break with a score of 
8-5 . 

"We were consistent and just 
didn't miss too much," Nejad said. 
"We made a lot of our first serves." 

T he deciding winner of the 
doubles point came down to No. 
1 doubles with Triton seniors Jeff 
Wilson and Sameer Chopra up 
against the ninth-ranked pair in 
Division I, Felix Hardt and Ryan 
Redondo. 

"Sameer and I had a nothing-
to-lose mentality going into the 
match," Wilson said. "We just 
wanted to play our best, hit the 
crap out of the ball and go for 
shots." 

T heir match began with 

Lori DfaholllGuardan file 
Slap 'em around: Despite making a strong showing over Division I San Diego State, the Tritons saw their record fall to 3-2 
overall on the 2004 season. Bryan Swatt (left) and doubles partner Amir Nejad won their doubles match, 8-5. 
Chopra and Wilson bombing 
serves in the first couple of service 
games and playing a solid return 
game early on. Play went back 
and forth throughout the match 
and was finally decided by a 
tiebreaker at 8-8. Chopra and 
Wilson got off to an early 6-3 

lead, but Hardt and Redondo 
fought their way back to tie it at 
6-6. Chopra and Wilson, ranked 
third in Division II, pulled it off 
in the end, however, taking the 
match and the doubles point 'for 
UCSD, 9-8 (8-6). 

"I was really nervous, but I aJso 

had a lot of adrenaline," Wilson 
said. "And at 7-6, I probably hit 
the best backhand of my life on his 
volley to win it all. [Winning that 
match] made me feel like we can 
beat anyone. It was a take-it-or-

Water polo bounces back on four--game win streak 
By DANIEL DIAl 

Staff Writer 

Bolstered by a desire to remain 
competitive, the UCSD women's 
water polo team downed San Jose 
State on Feb. 20, 4-3, then rallied 
to a third-place fini sh at the UC 
Davis Shootout on Feb. 21 and 
Feb. 22 . T heir run featured elec-
tri fying wins over UC Santa Cruz, 
14-4, UC Davis, 7-6, and Arizona 
State, 3 - I, lifting the Tritons from 
the doldrums of underachieve-
ment, a high that even a 6-3 loss to 
San Diego State in the champi-
onship game couldn't sour. 

Since slumping to a 2-7 start, the 
Tritons have climbed back up the 
ranks of the nation's best with a 6-8 
record. The four-win performance 
featured three victories over oppo-
nents ranked higher than No. 17 

UCSD, including a triumph over 
Western Water Polo Association at 
rivaJ No. 14 UC Davis. 

In addition to tripling their 
number of total wins in 2004, the 
Tritons offense experienced a 
revival of sorts, scoring 31 goals in 
five games, a marked improvement 
over the 47 tallied in the Tritons' 
previous nine appearances. Despite 
a slow finish, senior two-meter 
defender Meris Bantilan-Smith and 
junior utility Tobi Lyman gave the 
flailing UCSD offense a jolt of life 
with 17 combined goaJs. 

In a thriJIing finish against UC 
Davis, the Tritons were even at 6-6 
with time winding down. Lyman, 
deep in her own half, tossed up a 
lob that arched over the out-
stretched arms of Aggie goaltender 
Meggan Brownrigg into the far 
corner of the cage for a dramatic 

buzzer-beater, stunning the home 
crowd and leaving her teammates 
frozen in awe before rushing to cel-
ebrate the 7-6 victory. 

"Tobi tossed up a beautiful lob. 
Watching the ball, I was thinking, 
'Wow, that's got a good arc, and 
[Brownrigg] is out of position - it 
has a chance,' and straight into the 
goal it went," said senior goalie 
Stephanie Lombardo, who had 
seven saves in the match. "We just 
stood there, stunned." 

Lyman's effort was a' surprising 
finish to a see-saw match, typicaJ 
for the UCSD-UC Davis rivalry, 
in which neither team led by more 
than one goal. It marked the sec-
ond consecutive one-goal triumph 
over the Aggies, the first being a 6-
5 win in the 2003 WWPA 
Championship semifinals.

. fourth score on Tuesday, but third 
in relation to Division II teams is 
fine," Wydra said. "It's also nice to 
beat teams ranked ahead of you, 
like [CSU] Stanislaus." 

Only two Division II teams 
beat UCSD: Cal State 
Bakersfield, which shot rounds of 
280, 279 and 282, totaling of 841,
