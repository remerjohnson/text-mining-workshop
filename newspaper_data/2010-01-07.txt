Gov. Schwarzenegger made an 
ambitious proposal Wednesday morn-
ing, in his last annual State of the State 
address: He promised to amend the 
California constitution so that no less 
than 10 percent of the state’s budget 
could be spent on higher education. 

Schwarzenegger’s bill — a far 
cry from his suggestion last year to 
completely eliminate funding for Cal 
Grants — would remove funding from

Torrey Pines State Beach, also 
known as Black’s Beach, will be reduc-
ing the months that lifeguards patrol 
its shores from June to Labor Day 
after a proposal made by San Diego 
Mayor Jerry Sanders was approved 
by the San Diego City Council on 
Dec. 14 in order to accommodate city 
budget reductions.

Previously, the city of San Diego 
assigned lifeguards to protect beach-
goers from late March through 
October. Black’s was chosen for cuts 
as it is has smaller attendance than 
other beaches in the area.

“It’s not as heavily populated in 

terms of beachgoers as other beaches,” 
San Diego fire department spokesper-
son Maurice Luque said. “So we had 
to put our resources where the high-
est danger was in terms of number of 
people that are at the beach.”

Sanders designed the proposal 
to save money for the city and fire 
department.

“It’s all part of the budget cuts 
that all city departments are facing 
right now,” Luque said.“There’s only 
so much to go around. We have to 
prioritize where it’s put and where we 
put our personnel.”

With no lifeguards assigned to the 
beach itself from September to May, 
response time to any call can take 
around 20 minutes. The closest beach 
to Black’s with lifeguards on patrol 
will remain La Jolla Shores Beach.

“We’re advising people to be care-
ful [and] don’t put themselves at 
risk,” Luque said. “If something hap-
pens, there may be a delayed time of 

response to get somebody over there 
to help.”

Lifeguards originally scheduled to 
patrol Black’s will be reassigned to 
other local beaches.

Black’s suffered from other cuts 
last year as well. Service reductions 
such as the removal of waste bins and 
the closing of restroom facilities were 
implemented last fall.

Many UCSD students still visit 
Black’s in the winter, when no life-
guards patrol originally.

“It doesn’t make a difference 
to me,” Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Phillip Wybenga said. 
“I’ll still go to Black’s Beach. I don’t 
think the reduction of lifeguards on 
duty will really deter a lot of people 
from going there. There’s always a 
little risk of getting injured in really 
any activity, [and] there was never 
really a great presence of lifeguards 
there... Black’s Beach is just too 
much fun.”

Geisel Library unveiled the $1.8 
million makeover of its Arts Library 
on Dec. 15, complete with digital 
technology infrastructure and high-
definition media workstations locat-
ed on the first floor. 

The renovations began in Winter 
Quarter 2007 and concluded Fall 
Quarter 2009.

According to UCSD 
Communications Director Dolores 
Davies, the project was initiated a 
decade ago, when UCSD Libraries 
determined that Geisel Library’s three 
separate parts — Art and Architecture, 
Music and Film and Video — were too 
disjointed to meet the changing needs 

of students and faculty. An advisory 
group composed of faculty and stu-
dents was formed to guide a renova-
tion and consolidation of the libraries. 

The new Arts Library consoli-
dates the three previous areas into 
one efficient workspace. According 
to Leslie Abrams, head librarian of 
the Arts Library, combining the three 

customer-service stations allows for 
an additional 16 hours of service per 
week, and allows the library to house 
its collections on compact shelves — 
creating more study areas.

“The consolidation opened up 
space tremendously,” Abrams said. 
“Most of it is underground, but you 
don’t feel like you are, because we 

have brought in so much light.”
The initial proposal projected a 

cost of $8 million, but the project was 
ultimately completed with less than 
$1.8 million. The renovations were 
funded by a grant from the Mellon 
Foundation, which had committed to

After two years of work, Geisel’s Arts Library is finally complete. The new facility is a combination of the old Art and Architecture, Music, and Film and Video 
Libraries. By combining the three and adding new facilities, the space is now more conducive to use and study for students.

Students could face new loan 
regulations after the House of 
Representatives voted Dec. 11 to 
increase borrowing restrictions, an 
effort to curb rising student debt rates.

If passed by the Senate, the 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act would create the 
Consumer Financial Protection 

Agency, a watchdog 
organization meant to 
protect students from 
predatory private loans 
by enforcing height-
ened verification laws. 

Private loans offer a 
greater degree of flexibility than federal 
loans, but also have interest rates that 
can reach up to 18 percent and high 
repayment fees. 

In the 2007-08 academic year, stu-
dents took out $17 billion in private 
loans — an increase of 592 percent 
from 10 years earlier.

Under the new verification laws, all 
private lending organizations would be 
required to verify the enrollment sta-
tus of potential student borrowers and 
determine whether they are still eli-
gible for federal loans. Students would 
be required to attend a financial-aid 
counseling session prior to taking out 
a private loan and learn all the other 
options available to them.

“The act is designed to benefit any 
consumer and any student and pro-
tect them from deceptive tactics,” said 
Angela Peoples, legislative director of 
the United States Student Association.

Peoples said the provision ensures 
that students are fully aware of federal 
loan options, considering as many as 
64 percent of students who are eligible 
for federal loans take out private ones 
instead. 

“Since [students] don’t have to come 
to the office, sometimes [they’ll] take 
out a loan before they realize that they 
are eligible for federal loans,” Peoples 
said. “We are trying to create educated 
and well-protected consumers.”

“We support having the school cer-
tify the student’s eligibility for a private 
loan,” Klein said in a statement.  “This 
would ensure that the student has an 
opportunity to utilize other financial 
aid available before taking the private 
loan, as well as not overstating the 
amount the student may need to bor-
row.”

The bill also requires that loans not 
exceed the cost of attendance. Peoples 
said that this requirement is meant to 
curb rising student debt. 

In the 2008-2009 school year, 700 
students at UCSD took out $7 million 
in private loans. According to Klein, 
these numbers are relatively small 
because 65 percent of undergraduates 
received a total of $236 million in 
financial aid last year.

According to Peoples’, the bill’s 
passage is a top priority for the 
Obama Administration and Senator 
Christopher Dodd (D-Connecticut).

House Cracks Down on Student Loans

the project before the budget crisis.
“The money was saved at a much 

better time fiscally,” Abrams said. “We 
are very lucky, because if we tried to 
get this money now, it wouldn’t be 
possible in this fiscal climate. It really 
is a gift to the students.”

The renovated Arts Library 
features improvements such as 
digital-media production studios, 
high-definition media-viewing sta-
tions and a film preservation studio. 
Students can now view films on high 
definition monitors and listen to 
audio from 8 a.m. to midnight every 
Sunday through Thursday.Three 
new group viewing spaces will be 
available by this spring.

California’s prison system and put it 
toward the state’s universities. 

Currently, California spends 11 
percent of its General Fund on public 
prisons, and 7.5 percent on higher edu-
cation (of that, 5.9 percent is devoted 
to the University of California and the 
California State University systems). 
Ten years ago, the state was spending 

10 percent of the General Fund on 
education and 3 percent on prisons. 

“Spending 45 percent more on pris-
ons than universities is no way to pro-
ceed into the future,” Schwarzenegger 
said in his address. “What does [this 
statistic] say about our state? What 
does it say about any state that focuses 
more on prison uniforms than on caps 
and gowns? It simply is not healthy.” 

The proposed amendment would 
cap taxpayer spending on prisons at 7 
percent of the total budget, and create a 
10-percent minimum for spending on 
higher education. 

According to Daniel Simmons, Vice 
Chair of the UC Office of the President 
Academic Senate, this amendment 
would provide a much-needed source 
of economic stability and help ease the 

financial burden placed on students by 
rising tuition. 

“University really has three sources 
of revenue — research funding, the 
state and fees — and of course the 
only one the university has any real 
control over is student fees,” Simmons 
said. “What the state doesn’t provide

for the education of our students, the 
students are going to have to provide. 
So as the state gives us a stable source 
of funding, it will take the pressure off 
of student fees.” 

Though the amendment may come 
before voters as early as the November 
2010 ballot, it will not go into effect 
until 2014, giving the state enough 
time to privatize the prison system and 
begin redirecting taxpayer money. 

The UC system received a cut in 
funding last year, when the state chose 
to finance the university $2.6 billion 
instead of the $2.9 billion it provided 
in the 2008-09 academic year. UCOP 
made up for the difference by passing 
a 32-percent student fee increase at 
the UC Board of Regents meeting in 
November. 

 According to Simmons, though 
the university would welcome the 
additional funding, it will still be facing 
budgetary shortfalls and relying finan-
cially on student in the coming years.

“The bad news is that the pro-
posal really doesn’t kick in until 2014,” 
Simmons said. “So even if it were to be 
adopted by the people of California, 
we still have some years of difficulty in 
front of us.” 

Schwarzenegger said he hopes that 
providing more funding for higher 
education will aid California’s long-
term economic recovery.

“Choosing universities over pris-
ons is a historic and transforming 
realignment of California’s priorities,” 
Schwarzenegger said. “If you have two 
states, and one spends more educating 
and one spends more incarcerating, 
in which state’s economy would you 
invest?”

his plan on the one used by UC 
Berkeley’s student government and 
collect voluntary student fees of 
$5 to $10 per quarter to improve 
student life for commuters. He 
proposed constructing off-campus 
housing and a Greek row, as well as 
obtaining legal representation. 

Muir senators Ryan O’Rear and 
Lynne Swerhone announced that 
their council project, a KSDT radio 
show, will air next Tuesday at 1 a.m.

Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund informed the council that 
plans for the A.S. Store are near 
completion and begged the council 
to help him write a business plan.

AVP Enterprise Operations Rishi 

Ghosh announced that the Grove 
Cafe will be reopening Jan. 19.

“A blast of promotion next week 
will be the most critical part of its 
success, or not a success, however it 
goes,” Ghosh said. 

Councilmembers debated for 
about 10 minutes over whether to 
close the meeting to the public before 

discussing the 
creation of a 
co-managerial 
position for the 
Grove Cafe.

As the only 
individual pres-
ent at the meet-

ing who was not a member of the 
A.S. council, I took the hint, but 
waited for an official vote before 
waiting outside for 30 minutes.

Upon my return, councilmem-
bers voted to approve the position.

As the council moved on to 
new business, they discussed trivial 
matters, bringing up the question 
of whether various proposals even 
belonged in new business, which 
is reserved for pressing and timely 
issues. 

Haglund pushed for an approval 
to rewrite the standing rules to have 
meetings end at his proposed dead-
line of 11 p.m. A number of council-
members stated their disapproval of 
this irrelevant topic.

“I don’t want this to wait — if 
it fails then it fails,” Haglund said. 
The motion did fail, but the council 
voted to discuss the issue next week.

VP Finance and Resources Peter 
Benesch wanted to put into writing 
that “no event that charges admis-
sion for undergraduate students 
will receive funding from A.S., 
with exceptions from the Student 
Organization Funding Advisory 
Board and the finance committee.” 

The proposal passed by a roll-
call vote 12-10.

Following a Christmas season filled with more food, family time and rainbow-print toe 
socks (thanks, Mom) than I’ll need 
in a lifetime, I spent the last couple 
days of break seeking out mindless 
entertainment on my laptop. 

Sure enough, a twinkling gem 
sparkled on the AOL homepage: 
“How to Shop on Black Friday,” 
brought to us by eHow.com. A little 
preparation and a pre-shopping 
game plan, apparently, will take you 
a long way in the pursuit of a fabu-
lous find.

I’ve always thought Black Friday 
merely referred to the annual post-
Thanksgiving sales frenzy. But 
according to the trusty ol’ Internet, 
the term can be used to describe 
any store’s blowout sale that hurls 
push-up bras and digital cameras 
our way as a strategy to clear its 
racks — a phenomenon that often 
takes place in the same proportions 
between Christmas and New Year’s. 
It’s an exciting time (especially 
when you spot the same God-like 
Coach purse you’d seen glowing 
on its pedestal while Christmas 
shopping for Aunt Jenny weeks 
earlier, now being sold for a whop-
ping 75 percent off, just waiting to 
be snatched up by my greedy little 
paws).

When it comes to shopping, 
I’ve realized that the mall per-
fectly embodies my high-school 
cafeteria at lunch hour — complete 
with the “cool” (devastatingly bor-
ing) table at which I don’t belong 
(Abercrombie & Fitch), the cozy 
corner in the quad that’s hard to 
tear myself from when it’s time for 
class (Forever 21) and the comfy 
“reject” bench that looks like a 
pretty good time, but is too embar-
rassing to hang around much (Old 
Navy). 

As a general rule, our budgets 
dictate the type of stores we fre-
quent. So, regardless of what meets 
our fancy, we average Joes must 
always remind ourselves that our 
place is in Payless and consign-
ment row — not Bloomingdale’s. 
I, for one, can never find a top in 
Charlotte Russe that will blend into 
my black-and-blue wardrobe, but a 
Guess mannequin is usually rock-
ing exactly what I’ve been searching 
for. Accordingly, I always spend a 
few moments in front of aforemen-
tioned window display, feeling cov-
etous yet penniless.

But sales unify mall rats of all 
shapes and sizes — rich or strug-
gling, expert or rookie. Shopping is 
a sport. Its rules remain the same 
whether your equipment consists of 
Daddy’s American Express card or 
a humble sack of quarters. All you 
need to know are the cardinal rules 
of the game — which brings us back 
to our little Internet how-to.

First, take advantage of the tech-
nology available to you. If you have 
an iPhone check the “Pic2Shop” app 
for the lowest prices in your area, 
or click your way to www.shopzilla.

The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009, which passed in the House 
on Dec. 11, tightens loan regulations 
to ensure that students are only spend-
ing money on the necessities (you 
know, things like a 32-percent-more-
expensive, substantially less competitive 
education). Though the bill is a noble 
attempt at locking down the loan mar-
ket to avoid future classes, it creates 
a dangerously restrictive system for a 
demographic that’s barely weaned itself 
off mom and dad’s bank account.

The bill would create the Consumer 
Financial Protection Agency — a watch-
dog organization to regulate home 
mortgages, credit cards, interest rates 
and student loans. The agency has the 
power to cap the amount of money stu-
dents can borrow and — most impor-
tantly — where we can borrow it from. 
The bill would empower us by provid-
ing beneficial information about finan-
cial options and the ability to take out 
federal loans, but then degrade us by 
placing a cap on private loans and tak-
ing the power to make these important 
financial decisions out of our hands 

There’s more than enough bad news 
and ugly numbers to explain why this 
bill was proposed. Private loans — 
which can have interest rates up to 18 
percent — were taken out by 23 percent 
of college students by 2006. On average, 
62 percent of public university gradu-
ates face an average debt of $20,200 
by the time they set out on the job 
hunt. The outlook for paying it back 
doesn’t look too hopeful either: the U.S. 
Department of Education reported an 
increase in the student loan default rate 
from 5.2 percent to 6.2 percent from 
2007 to 2008.

Under this bill, all institutions which 
offer private loans are regulated by the 
CFPA. Officials must verify the enroll-
ment status of any potential student 
borrowers to determine whether a stu-
dent is eligible to take out federal loans. 
If a potential borrower is still eligible for 
a federal loan, private institutions are 
obligated to advise that choice instead. 
Though it might not be good for busi-
ness, fat cats like private loan company 
Sallie Mae are obligated to inform 
potential students borrowers of all other 
options available.

If the 64 percent of students who 
take out private loans while still eligible 
for federal money can avoid doing so, 
all the better, but the CFPA also has a 
stiffer agenda: to make sure these lend-
ers are only giving loans to students 
who will use the money strictly for edu-

cational purposes.
It’s no secret that we use loan money 

for more than just textbooks and 
tuition. Even more tempting than bor-
rowing money for college is using it to 
pad our cushy lifestyle just a little bit 
longer. And that’s exactly what this bill 
tries to fight.

In a perfect world, loan money 
would be used for education, not a 
tricked MacBook Pro. Students would 
only take out private loans when they 
need to and not cripple their finances 
by borrowing more money than the cost 
of attendance.

But it’s important for politicians 
to remember that we’re more than 
machines whose whole existence is ded-
icated to mastering quantum mechanics 
over a 24-pack of ramen. College is a 
game of responsibility, and playing may 
require exceeding the basics, student 
debt be damned. So maybe we want 
to fund a trip around world before we 
graduate. Or, less thrilling, newfound 
financial hardship may arise.

And maybe we need the money 
because a MacBook Pro is the only 
way to follow our dream of becoming 
a hotshot filmmaker. Who’s to say that 
luxuries aren’t part of our education 
too? If we come up short, should we just 
give up?

Placing a cap on our income because 
we’re college students is a step back 
from California’s leading example. It 
forgets to take into account the vary-
ing circumstances in which we might 
need money, to invest in our career and 
it cripples our ability to manage our 
finances, debt and future. 

Student loans are among the most 
ironclad of financial agreements, unable 
to be discharged even in the case of 
bankruptcy or death. We may not 
have the best track record while we’re 
in school, but the fact that we’re in a 
four-year university and the loans are 
impossible to discharge ensure that they 
will eventually be paid back. For every 
student who needs more money for a 
ritzy spring break trip, there’s another 
one who needs it for that essential 
laptop the parents won’t shell out for. 
H.R. 4173 tries to protect everyone, but 
instead marginalizes those who truly 
need the help.

We may be an expensive bunch, but 
expecting us to run the world without 
some financial autonomy will postpone 
our eventual success even further. We’re 
young, naive and we learn best through 
trial and error — God forbid we learn 
those lessons in the real world when a 
lot more is at stake.

MASTER OF ARTS
INTERNATIONAL STUDIES

In today’s global environment, expertise in international affairs
is essential to understanding the contemporary world.
The Chapman University Master of Arts in International Studies is a two-year,
full-time, interdisciplinary course of study designed to train students seeking
a career in U.S. Foreign Service, the United Nations (U.N.), U.N.–specialized
agencies, or international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Our program
is well-rounded with academic and practical training, professional and regional
tracks, international internships and hands-on experience for today’s world.

For more information, contact Dr. James Coyle, program director, at 714-744-7074
or coyle@chapman.edu.

Dear Editor,
In Spring Quarter 2007, I was one 

of the many economics students at 
UCSD learning about the fascinating 
social and economic changes tak-
ing place in China. After so many of 
my courses had a special focus on 
China, I decided that the best way 
to understand what was happening 
was by studying in China and seeing 
things firsthand. The idea of learning 
the language and trying to adapt to a 
completely different culture made the 
idea of the trip even more appealing. 
I found the business and econom-
ics program at Fudan University in 
Shanghai and applied immediately. 

In the beginning of the application 
process, I was concerned about the 
costs involved with studying abroad. 
But after doing some research and vis-
iting the Education Abroad Program 
office, I realized that the cost is not 
necessarily higher than staying in 
UCSD. Even if certain exchange pro-
grams are more expensive, there are 
scholarships that are only available for 
students who study abroad. I applied 
to five of these scholarships, and I 
received the Gilman International 
Scholarship. The Gilman scholarship 
provides awards for U.S. undergradu-
ate students who are receiving federal 
Pell Grant funding to participate in 
worldwide study abroad programs. 
There are other study abroad scholar-
ships available, and people from the 
Education Abroad Program office can 
help you find the right ones for your 
particular exchange program. So if one 
is really determined to go abroad and 
willing to spend some time applying 
for scholarships, money should not 
be an obstacle. The experience is defi-
nitely worth it. Students will learn a lot 
about the country they visit, but most 

importantly, they will learn a lot about 
themselves.

Living in Shanghai challenged me 
from day one, as I had to immerse 
myself in a completely different world 
literally overnight. The very first day I 
arrived at my new university’s dorm, 
I had to use the little Mandarin I had 
learned to find my new apartment, 
figure out how the heater worked, 
introduce myself to my Korean room-
mate (he spoke no English) and 
urgently buy toilet paper. 

My visits around the city and trips 
around the country were just as useful 
as my courses when it came to learn-
ing about China’s success story and 
current challenges. I visited Buddhist 
temples located next to brand new 
shopping malls, took trains across 
beautiful landscapes and polluted riv-
ers and walked by Beijing’s brand new 
luxury hotels as well as its overcrowd-
ed run-down buildings. Contrasts are 
everywhere in China, and studying 
there was the best way for me to expe-
rience its implications for the country 
itself and the rest of the world.

After the end of my year abroad, 
I returned to UCSD with a much 
clearer understanding of China’s cur-
rent challenges, a better idea of my 
capacity to be outside my comfort 
zone and enough Mandarin to keep in 
touch with the Chinese friends I left 
in Shanghai.

asking the already swamped makeup 
lady at Nordstrom where to find 
cheapest women’s shoes will only 
waste precious time, allowing for 
varsity shoppers to swoop on your 
desirables. Google-image a floor plan 
of your corporate wasteland of choice 
beforehand. I’m serious — it helps.

The next step is easy: Come 
equipped with a list of desirables 
(and consult it frequently) to make 
sure you’re not distracted by every 
sequined sandal that flies your way. 
Bring a pen and cross off the items 
you’ve already purchased. Another 
plus: this creates an illusion of strict 
business, so you can speed past the 
piranhas pushing bedazzled cell 

phone covers onto unsuspecting 
shoppers in a fast-talking flurry.

The last step is especially impor-
tant for those who never mustered 
up enough pride 
to switch tables 
in high school. 
Sometimes the 
eerie, perfume-
fog environ-
ments of a fancy 
store can divert 
one’s attention 
away from his 
or her shopping 
mission, but 
don’t get drunk 
on name brands. Clothes are clothes. 
Just because you drop $85 on a 

rhinestone-encrusted Ed Hardy tee, 
it won’t necessarily win you a spot 
at the cool-kid table (and if it does, 
consider relocating).

Next time you hit the 
mall, don’t be intimidated 
into your usual hunting 
grounds. Finding real 
treasures become more of 
a reality when you do the 
research and create a game 
plan. A step out of your 
comfort zone might even 
win you those Rock and 
Republic jeans you’ve had 
your eye on. So get crack-
ing on your research and 

dig up your most serious sneakers 
— the sales are calling.

THE 10 MOST
LIFE-CHANGING

ALBUMS
OF THE

T he ’00s are behind us, but do we feel better for it? While musical subgenres ebbed and flowed in 
the limelight, there were few domi-
nant arcs to the headphone waves 
these past 10 years. Diverging blogs 
catered to the most particular chill-
fi and psychedelic crack-hop tastes, 
providing an almost limitless source 
for our iPod identities. It was all so 
overwhelming; I never thought my 
hard drive would hit 80 gigs of music 
(let alone 30), and — to be honest 
— it has left me engorged and a little 
nauseous.

But sometimes it just takes a 
little perspective, a revisiting of the 
records that continued to inspire me 
as I left my teen years behind for 
the bearded college life. Here, in no 
particular order, are 10 LPs — some 
obvious, some obscure  — that facili-
tated that journey.

F irst game-changer on the list is Yoni Wolf ’s morbid indie-hop opus. It treats wordplay like 
cupcake sprinkles, garnishing the 
band’s warm rock instrumentals in 
abstract blog-poetry confessionals. 
Nothing else in rap or indie comes 
off like this — Elephant is one of 
those hopelessly genuine albums that 
you’ll either love or despise, because 
Wolf ’s nasal croon and jet-black lyr-
ics polarize folks like lasting music 
should. Thirty seconds of the vivid, 
cruising “Gemini” will convince you 
either way.

T his vibrant head-trip of an album made me believe in noise. I remember thinking, ‘This is 
where music is going’ — pure sounds, 
collaged. I’d bet that in 20 years or 
less, mainstream pop will steal this 
groundwork and shape these far-out

DECADEINREVIEW

A few meager indie scraps from Grizzly Bear, Karen O and that Knife chick weren’t nearly enough 
to keep us warm in the economic ice 
age of 2009. Luckily, a few select artists 
knew just what we needed: to dance. 
R&B gained some weight, techno ros-
ied its cheeks with dubstep, top-40 hip-
hop adopted a latin flair, Ghostface 
got cuddly and Beyonce somehow got 
hotter the longer she role-played Sasha 
Fierce. Shivering in the shadow of all 
those big beats, experimental rock was 
trumped by old-school sex bangers 
this year — at which point the noblest 
of the pale skinnies did man up and 
jump in the fire. 

Please don’t kill me, Kanye, but 
“Single Ladies” don’t got shit on 
“Sweet Dreams.” Beyonce’s sleepy, 
swirly underdog single technically 
made its debut on last year’s I Am… 
Sasha Fierce, but it wasn’t until the 
bluescreen blowout of its music 
video that “Dreams” could really flex 
its muscles.

R emember the first time you saw “Toy Story” and your eyes welled up when Woody and Buzz finally became friends? Anyone who has seen “Up” knows Pixar hasn’t let up with the warm fuzzies since. When an old man’s wife dies, 
he’s determined to fulfill their dream of moving to South America. In an effort to 
dodge retirement home confinement, he attaches balloons to his house and makes 
a fabulous exit. Unbeknownst to him, Russell — a lost boy scout — is along for the 
ride and the unlikely pair are in for quite the adventure filled with talking dogs, a 
giant mama bird named Kevin, and a washed up hero interfere. Now, I know what 
you’re thinking — it’s a Disney movie. But before you deny yourself childlike won-
der, consider this, it takes one talented team of animators to make grumpy geezers 
like us laugh and cry, ooh and aww. Wes Anderson gets points for challenging 
Pixar’s monopoly with innovative art direction in “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” for now, the 
crown stays with Disney for it’s imaginative concepts and ability to bring elderly 
folk back in style.

M ove over Apatow, there’s another funnyman in town. That’s right, Todd Phillips, the mastermind behind “Old School,” is back with a ven-geance and it’s spelled V-E-G-A-S. When a bachelor party in Sin City 
ends with a missing groom, a lost tooth and a trashed hotel room, it’s up to 
the three groomsmen to puzzle together the previous night of which they 
have no recollection. Though it sounds like another regrettable I-hope-they-
serve-beer-in-hell bro romp, you’ll be pleasantly surprised to find out what 
happens when the host of Funny or Die’s “Between Two Ferns,” Sack from 
“Wedding Crashers” and Andy Bernard are put in the same hotel room. All 
I can say is: it involves Mike Tyson’ tiger. Expect drunken stupors, random 
chickens to appear out of nowhere, and the same Mary J humor that made 
“Adventureland” so pee-your-pants funny. And if that’s not enough to tickle 
your fancy, try this on for size: an unidentified baby and a nimble Chinese 
gangster get thrown in the mix.

M ichael Cera is a quirky kid who’s des-
perately in need of 
some love. 

If you’ve been 
anywhere near a movie theater in the last three years, 
you’re well aware of it. Whether he’s seeking to impress 
a lifelong crush in “Superbad,” pining after some girl he 
knocked up in “Juno” or combing NYC for a drunk chick 
in “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist,” Cera always comes 
through with a cutesy confession. 

Needless to say, his role in “Youth in Revolt” — based 
on the book series by C.D. Payne — is one of the same. 
Nick Twisp, a well-mannered, teenaged Sinatra aficionado 
living with trailer trash, longs to cash his V-card an awk-
ward pause with a girlfriend of his very own. But when it 
becomes obvious that his occasional eye contact with the 
opposite sex isn’t doing the trick, his alter ego — the devil-
ish and debonair Francois Dillinger — takes the reigns. 
Before we know it, Nick is on his way to winning over his 
hot new neighbor Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday).

But before we’re even introduced to the cast, which boasts

T here’s nothing like a lovers-to-enemies love story to get some on-screen chemistry bubbling. 
Unfortunately, in Anand Tucker’s latest 
chick flick-out-of-your-memory, any sort 
of sexy tension gives way to annoying 
bickering. 

Amy Adams stars as the rigid and con-
trolling Anna, who is looking for happi-
ness in a wedding ring — a letdown to any 
feminists hoping to see the next Adams 
flick. But when her boyfriend (Adam 
Scott) of four years fails to propose, she 
takes matters into her 
own hands. Planning to 
propose to her man on 
Leap Day, Anna journeys 
to Dublin to surprise her 
love with a proposal — 
apparently, it’s an ancient 
Irish tradition.

You guessed it: The 
plan goes awry. When 
inclement weather halts 
the expedition, our fearless heroine seeks 
refuge in a Welsh B&B run by the smok-
ing hot Declan (Matthew Goode). He 

conveniently offers to 
drive her to Ireland. 

And so begins a slough of bickering, 
insults, sexism and irritating dialogue. Along 
the way, cows are harassed, his car is totaled, 

her clothes are ruined and their true selves 
are exposed: He’s afraid of commitment, bit-
ter because his fiance ran off with his best

This Friday, catch Jeff Bridges (“The Big 
Lebowski”) as the deeply tortured country music 
singer Bad Blake in director Scott Cooper’s ﬁrst 
feature ﬁlm. After a few failed marriages, years 
on the road, and far too many tequila sunrises, 
Blake is time-worn and bitter, with no patience for 
a young journalist (Maggie Gyllenhaal) determined 
to uncover the man behind the music. With strong 
supporting actors, Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell, 
and a kickin’ soundtrack, the ﬁlm promises to 
inject life into what would appear to be a blasé 
storyline.(JB)

ULTRAZONE — The Ultimate Laser Adventure

ideas into hits. Abrasive and gorgeous, 
Black Dice’s animal record shaped 
an African safari from samples and 
processed guitar. They might sound 
like birds and elephants, but it’s really 
three dudes twiddling knobs.

B efore these rippers, I thought hardcore was a bunch of bas-ketball-shorted bros screaming 
like Cookie Monster, but Jane Doe’s 
“Concubine” convinced me to finally 
give tatted scenesters a chance. And 
then You Fail Me, their next record, 
was pure death-scuzz love. From the 
brutal chug of the title track to Jacob 
Bannon’s banshee wail on “Eagles 
Become Vultures,” these four dis-
regard genre tropes in favor of the 
creative — the heavy-as-fuck.

W hile it’s super hard for me to pick a favorite Deerhoof record, I chose Apple O’ 
because it’s the album that introduced 
me to Satomi Matsuzaki and her 
merry friends, and arguably the pur-
est expression of their ragged-pop 
style. Satomi’s shrill coos over vintage 
tube guitars and spastic, mashed 
drums make for hyper-cute ditties 
with a twisted undertow. These post-
modern Rolling Stones should be way 
more popular than they are.

S peaking of popularity, when I started high school, I was convinced these Sonic Youth 

disciples from my very own suburb 
(Thousand Oaks) would ride out of 
our sleepy town with this record and 
never return. While it didn’t go at all 
as I imagined — the band played a 
final show a few years back and dis-
solved into the real world — their 
full-length inspired my love for musi-
cal honesty and community. This LP 
contains some of the raddest guitar 
riffs and tones ever put to tape. 

F uture sex techno-soul on a yacht sailing through mercury — that’s what FlyLo’s about. His Warp 
debut is timeless like a classic jazz 
record, jammed with outerspace 
breakbeats that never wear out their 
welcome. My 2010 prediction: His 
new record, Cosmogramma (drop-
ping on 4/20) is going to be the most 
hyphy album of the year.

I ’m a sucker for their first two LPs, and even though First Impressions of Earth is a cavernous blemish on 
their otherwise spotless track record, 
I still believe they can recover their 
cool with Album Four. I remember 
that school morning in fall 2001, 
when I first heard “Last Nite” on a 
friend’s burned CD, like it was yes-
terday — that evening I saw the boys’ 
music video on MTV and resolved 
to boycott nu-metal for good.

F or a while, I couldn’t stomach succumbing to Conor Oberst’s emo-folk — no matter how 

much it spoke to me. I had stan-
dards, goddammit. Then I heard his 
fuzzed-out ode to consumerism and 
couldn’t hold out any longer. While 
some of Bright Eyes’ lyrics address 
broad issues of love and politics to a 
populist fault, Desaparecidos is super 
specific about its parking lots and 
suffocating shopping bags. This punk 
doesn’t hide under distortion — it 
hones it like a dart, then shoots Coca-
Cola and Disneyland in the face.

M adlib and MF Doom’s superstar collab will go down in infamy for crackly vintage beats and 
bizarro-rhymes that hit a high ’90s 
rap could never touch. Refined but 
ever-weird, Doom spits lines like “Her 
big butt and smile was like camo/ Hit 
up the men’s room, we need more 
ammo.” Or how about “All bets off! 
The Villain got the dice rigged/ And 
they say he accosted the man with the 
sliced wig.” Delivered like a soulful 
sleeptalker, if I do say so myself.

T hese two LA locals don’t play complicated music, but great taste and ideas never lack on 
their concept-punk with delicate 
drones. Idea No. 1: It’s okay to be 
sloppy if you put thought and feeling 
into it. Idea No. 2: Punk and ambient 
noise are allowed to mix; anything’s 
game. Idea No. 3: Layer and sample 
the guitar licks until you get a My 
Bloody Valentine wall of sound, then 
channel that into a pop-punk gem. 
Their brainstorm seshes produced 
12 perfectly sequenced tunes, a 
30-minute wave of positive vibes and 
introspection.  

After a hard-rock, light-as-a-feath-
er intro (badass dove included) sets 
the theme, Beyonce enters her fitful 
shut-eye universe, that beautiful place 
where hair extensions are lost to the 
wind and stanky leg is the only way 
to get around. Like “Single Ladies” 
or the masturbatory “Videophone” 
(on which Beyonce rocks the tribal 
diapers and Lady Gaga makes a 
tranny-rific fool of herself), “Dreams” 
becomes synonymous with its video, 
until we find ourselves possessed with 
Her Hotness’ every body roll, even 
once we’ve backed away from the 
YouTube.

Now, if only shards of five-way 
mirror would fly past our hurricane 
manes, swept into a mind-controlled 
tidal wave as we undergo insta-3CPO 
costume change. But alas — there can 
be only one Sasha.

Of all the major players in reggaeton 
— Wisin y Yandel, Don Omar, Tito 
El Bambino — Daddy Yankee is gen-
erally the suckiest (even once you’ve 
forgiven the combed-flat gelly bangs 
and “Daddy Yankee punto com!” fill-
ers). Yet somehow, he always seems 
to pull the ’ton track of the year out 
his “Crossroads” bucket hat.

In this case, we can pretty 
clearly blame the beat. “El Ritmo No 
Perdona” runs at a pace barely with-
in the confines of danceability, but is 
all the more irresistible for that chal-
lenge — a gang of black Caribbean 
dudes pummel coked-out urban 
merengue so hard that the nearby 
video honeys begin to jerk around 
like puppets on strings. And just 
when we can’t keep up any longer, 
the beat drops into a slower, deeper 
grind (albeit ravaged by Yankee’s 
scream-o flow), whirlpooling our 
hips down the throat of a brass horn, 
always on its own accord.

The biggest loser in reggaeton is 
surprisingly the one to overcome the 

genre’s most grimacing simplicities, 
while at the same time — unlike 
the more experimental/respectable 
Calle 13 — never forgetting its main 
propósito: set our asses all a-shake.

Want to know what happens when 
a bunch of Jamaicans do too much 
E? Check the “Blue’s Clues”-gone-
freakay video for “Pon de Floor,” a 
collaboration between sometime 
M.I.A. producers Diplo and Switch 
— one big happy-colored orgy with 
friend explosions and silly zipper 
noises. No tutu removal required.

Major Lazer’s more palatable 
single “Keep It Going Louder” does 
boast a cute-as-fuck cameo from 
Nina Sky and makes for a more 
mindless, less giggly grind, but after 
a quick memorization of “Pon de 
Floor”’s starts and stops, you’ll feel 
like the most sexy awkward robot 
on the dance floor. Save Sasha, of 
course.

Never thought I’d say it, but these 
bitches are the best thing since TLC. 
On their video for “So Good” — off 
How To Be a Lady: Volume 1 — 
Kyndra, Lesley, Naomi and Sarah are 
like four rays of juicy-ass sunshine, 
strutting between ropes and magical 
chairs and roped magical chairs. The 
Lil Wayne remix will certainly swing 
them the spotlight they deserve, but 
Weezy sort of just geeks all over their 
healthy, hearty R&B for the soul, 
and something of its purity is lost. 
I’d prefer they stick to laying across 
each others’ laps and fingerpainting 
each other’s ensembles, thank you.

Ah, the joys of repping. Alicia Keys 
and Jay-Z made even the most 
devout West-Coasters wish for just a 
minute they were braving the streets 

of a Woody Allen movie (the old 
kind) for a few twinkly lit moments 
this holiday season. Then we learned 
we could just insert the name of our 
own small town into the operatic 
“New York” bit — then gesture to 
the nearest inspiring lights and girls 
that got ridden “like a bus route” in 
high school and now have the burp 
stains to prove it — and we could be 
just as proud as them shmancy cold-
weather folk. Best way to both start a 
party and end a night. I got a feelin’! 
Oh wait. Wrong one.

Gucci Mane’s brutish growl is noth-
ing we haven’t heard before (in fact, 
Young Jeezy and Mike Jones already 
dragged that bullshit onto my blacklist 
many moons ago), but his eerie ability 
to gather the hottest hooksters in the 
game ’round his lame-ish campfire 
— all at once, all night long — is the 
work of a god. (And a damn charm-
ing agent.) Mane’s first year on the 
scene, he released two gluttonous full-
lengths splitting its sides with melodi-
ous meats; not surprisingly, highlights 
see their guest star draw out his or her 
set as long as possible. Big Boi’s smart-
perv come-ons ride the skittish “Shine 
Blockers” limo far into the sunset; Lil 
Wayne is the life of the leaners on the 
“Wasted” party bus; but you can’t beat 
Usher’s smooth talk on “Spotlight” — 
and just when I thought we’d forgotten 
how to make love in this club.

HIATUS� THURSDAY, JANUARY 7, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN�9

friend, and she can’t let her Type-A 
tendencies loose and enjoy life.

While we’ve seen and mildly 
enjoyed it all before (in “The 
Proposal” and “27 Dresses”), as the 
plot unfolds, it becomes obvious 
that a certain sexiness is missing 
between the two lovebirds.

The romance feels forced even 
when it’s not supposed to. Sure, “Leap 
Year” has those staple chick flick 
moments when Anna and Declan are 
required to kiss, share a bed and even 
pretend they’re married, but all feeble 
attempts to be heartwarming only 
reveal the shallowness of both the 

characters and plot. 
Never fear though; the film ends 

as all rom-coms do — happily ever 
after. Yes, much to the cynical con-
tingent’s dismay, the story is strung 
together with a shiny red bow, as 
Anna realizes that the love she was 
so desperately searching for was in a 
homely little breakfast joint in Dingle. 

Though Ireland’s fairytale land-
scape keeps the film afloat for a 
time, the rolling hills simply aren’t 
enough to distract the audience 
from the lame message: True love 
can be found in three days — even 
if you’re constantly verbally abusing 
your lover.

I f it’s at all possible to silence any Tarantino prejudices you might have, this year’s Nazi blockbuster 
is definitely worth the effort. Sure, 
one too many of Hitler’s minions 
get scalped on screen, but if you 
know anything about the director, 
it’s no surprise. If you can stomach 
the bloodbath, the five-chapter story 
detailing a young Jewish refugee who 
seeks revenge for her family’s murder 
is pretty thrilling. Characters include 
the Colonel who killed them, the 
German war hero turned movie star 
Frederick Zoller, and a fictitious rag-
tag team of Jewish-American guerilla 
soldiers known as the “Basterds.” A 
word of the wise: you’re seeking real-
ism, watch “The Hurt Locker.” Brad 
Pitt’s role as Lieutenant Aldo Raine 
of the Basterds is far less annoy-
ing than his bumbling “Burn After 
Reading” performance, watching a 
bomb squad tiptoe through one Iraqi 
death trap after another is terrify-
ingly sobering. 

I t was quite a year for George — what, with his role as the bushy-tailed instigator in Anderson’s 
“Fantastic Mr. Fox” and stint as a 
psychic soldier who killed hoofed 
creatures with his mind in “The Men 
Who Stare at Goats” — but of course, 
he had to go out with a bang. In Jason 
Reitman’s latest, our knight in shin-
ing pinstripes stars as Ryan Bingham, 
a downsizing specialist who loves 
nothing more than travelling through 
airports 322 days of the year on busi-
ness. But when his mid-air lifestyle 
is threatened by a recent college grad 

who develops swifter layoff methods, 
he is forced to reassess his means of 
existence. The plot might not scream 
Academy Award, but the acting 
certainly does. With flawless perfor-
mances from Anna “Say goodbye to 
‘Twilight’” Kendrick, the gorgeous 
Vera Farmiga and Clooney, this 
stylistic glance into the life of a man 
who has everything and nothing will 
have you eating out of the palm of 
Reitman’s hand.

W hile it’s typically a safe bet to steer clear of any film starring Mariah Carey, “Precious” is 
the exception to the rule. It may be 
the most depressing two hours of 
your life, but it may also be the most 
uplifting. 16-year-old Claireece Jones 
(Gabourey Sidibe) has problems, but 
not your typical suburban “I want 
an iPhone woes”: She’s an obese 
teenager living on welfare in Harlem. 
Her mother beats her and her father 
has impregnated her twice. Her first 
child has Down Syndrome, she was 
suspended from school and she can’t 
read or write. Still complaining that 
you’ve run out of weed to smoke? 
Didn’t think so. It’s not often you 
seek out films where bad things hap-
pen to already unfortunate people. 
But here are three reasons why you 
should: Director Lee Daniels has an 
eye for capturing raw emotion and 
real human drama, everyone loves a 
good underdog story and with Oprah 
as an executive producer, how could 
you say no?

L et’s be real for a second. Whether you were dragged to AMC by your girlfriend, walked into the wrong 
theater by accident or proudly sport a 

Team Jacob T-shirt, you have to agree 
— “New Moon” was a sad excuse for a 
film. Sorry guys, but watching Kristen 
Stewart bite her lip while Robert 
Pattinson runs his fingers through 
his greasy mop of hair, isn’t quality 
cinema. Pull the “innocent teenage 
love story” card all you want, but at 
the end of the day, the latest “Twilight” 
installment is about as innocent as the 
giant posters of naked men that greet 
you in Abercrombie & Fitch. If you 
can get past the fact that the rock solid 
abs you’re ogling belong to a 17-year-
old who starred in “Cheaper by the 
Dozen 2” a mere four years ago, you’ll 
realize that most of the film is filled 
with awkward silences and some rain. 
Like its paranormal-book-turned-film 
rival “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood 
Prince,” the audience is left with one 
resonating question: Is that it?

R emember back in 1998 when that cute freckled-nose red head tricked her parents into getting 
remarried in “The Parent Trap”? Life 
was much simpler then. Fast-forward 
a couple Maxim spreads, some “heat 
exhaustion” hospitalizations, and a 
romance with DJ Samantha Ronson, 
and you’ve got the archetypal Disney 
Frankenstein — Lindsay Lohan. 
Following in her stumbling footsteps 
are this year’s pre-teen idols turned 
Perez Hilton regulars, Miley Cyrus 
and the Jonas Brothers. While both 
acts entered the scene with signature 
symbols of virtue, it didn’t take long to 
trade in their purity rings for a chance 
at the cover of “Rolling Stone” or a 
pair of sexy hot pants. If you feel like 
reminiscing about the idols pre-cor-
ruption, rent one of these flops, other-
wise stick to Us Weekly for up-to-date 
juice on these singers-turned-actors 
you love to hate. 

W hen you think Michael Bay, you think explosions. And that’s exactly what you’ll get 
in this year’s “Transformers” install-
ment that grossed an obscene $402 
million. That’s all you’ll get. Well, 
that’s not entirely true. You’ll also get 
to see Megan Fox lick her juicy lips 
via webcam. Honestly, how on earth 
does she keep them so moist all the 
time? Anyway, this time around our 
unlikely hero Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is 
headed off to the university without 
his trusty Camaro Bumblebee, in 
the hopes of having a real college 
experience. That of course, doesn’t 
last long. Before he can say keg stand, 
he’s face to face with Optimus Prime 
and the fate of the world is thrown 
in his hands — again. Insert a con-
fusing 15-minute explanation about 
Decepticons, aliens and Egyptian 
glyphs, then let the madness com-
mence. On a serious note, if watching 
giant pieces of scrap metal duke it out 
does it for you, check out “G.I. Joe: 
The Rise of Cobra,” another 2009 film 
that burned up a couple other B-list 
actors this year. 

A nyone who’s seen “Speed” knows why Sandra Bullock is still consid-ered a Hollywood starlet, despite 
the fact that her last decent role was as 
a supporting actress in “Crash.” But “All 
About Steve” will certainly make you 
question her title. When an eccentric 
crossword constructor falls head over 
red boots for her blind date (Bradley 
Cooper), she stalks him around the 
country to prove they’re meant to be. If 
the plot alone isn’t enough to make you 
run the opposite direction, Bullock’s 
hair certainly will. I don’t know what 
happened to her stylist, but whoever 
decided it was a good idea to ditch the 
long flowing locks we admired in “Miss 
Congeniality” for the cropped hay 
bale she sports in this film, should be 
thrown to the pigs. And no offense, but 
watching the 46-year-old actress waltz 
around in a mini skirt only makes her 
look old — like Dame Judi Dench old. 

W hile diehard “Friends” fans will continue to keep their fingers crossed for the resur-

rection of Jennifer Aniston’s career, 
this year’s token chick flop proves 
that Forrest Gump had it right all 
along — shit, not love, happens. In 
this “Sleepless in Seattle”-wannabe, 
Aaron Eckart trades in his Two-
Face persona for the role of a weepy 
self-help author who can’t take his 
own advice and face the reality of 
his wife’s death. During one of his 
seminars he meets a woman who 
will give him a run for his money, 
and well, something happens. Too 
bad it’s something unoriginal and 
boring. In place of depth, we get 
product placement, unintelligent 
advice about the grieving process, 
and some uncomfortable parallels 
between Jen’s unsuccessful love 
life and her character’s. While the 
film does, for the most part, lack 
in the detestable rom-com humor 
that made “He’s Just Not That Into 
You” so unbearable, with so much 
emotional baggage weighing down 
on the audience, the occasional 
breather would have been nice.  

I t’s been twelve years since “Titanic” blew Hollywood out of the water, and it looks like James 
Cameron has still got it. Sure, 
“Avatar” isn’t nearly as quotable, has 
a less attractive cast and doesn’t end 
with an epic iceberg battle, but it’s 
by far the most visually stimulat-
ing films that has come out of the 
last decade. Using every last cent of 
his rumored $300 million budget 
in developing the most technologi-
cally advanced special effects in the 
industry, Cameron delivers a spell-
binding cinematic experience that 
raises the bar for science fiction. 
But enough ass-kissing. Strip its 
aesthetics and the film is little more 
than a three-hour live action “Fern 
Gully.” And while most people are 
too awestruck to care, the one-
dimensional characters, weak script 
and obvious political undertones 
make for an underwhelming story 
that — in any other instance — 
would’ve been tossed into the $5 
bin at Best Buy.

the not-so-indie Jean Smart, Ray 
Liotta and Fred Willard, we’re flooded 
with an animated title sequence and 
kitschy soundtrack. Deja vu, anyone? 

What follows is nothing short of 
predictable — every Cera film goes 
from unrequited love to rite of pas-
sage in two hours — but the actor’s 
ability to underplay his underdog role 
with clumsy comedic timing and baby 
cheeks make it somewhat excusable. 

The bigger problem, however, is 
that we’re voyeuristically watching 
the same character mumble to him-
self and put his hands in his pockets 
for the thousandth time — and the 

formula no longer feels fresh. 
In fact, far more engaging than 

the coming-of-age story of a pre-
cocious recluse with no familial 
support are the well-developed char-
acters that surround him. Sheeni, 
the object of Nick’s affection, is the 
ideal mix of beauty, intelligence and 
immaturity — a cultured trailer 
park oxymoron with posters of Jean-
Paul Belmondo tacked to her wall. 
Her rebellious tendencies captivate 
far more than Cera’s tired Urban 
Outfitters pose, as she struggles to 
overcome her own parents’ expecta-
tions (or lack there of). 

Justin Long gets his fair share of 

witty one-liners as Sheeni’s deadbeat 
older brother, who drugs their par-
ents to make them more manage-
able during the holidays. And Steve 
Buscemi, Fred Willard and Zach 
Galifianakis deliver a few good knee-
slappers, making “Youth” a charming 
if unintelligent date movie. 

Sure, Cera once again plays 
the staple of our generation — the 
awkward virgin who, thanks to the 
Internet, is isolated, brainwashed 
and reaching out for a connection 
— but Twisp’s journey to the holiest 
of holes is surprisingly enjoyable if 
you remember to leave your brain 
at home.

best teams. It’s not up for discussion.
News services have fleshed out 

the game’s every angle: Colt McCoy’s 
chance at becoming only the second 
player in college football history to win 
four games (mind you, he red-shirted 
in 2005 when Texas beat USC in the 
Rose Bowl); Mark Ingram’s somewhat 
controversial Heisman Trophy award; 
how the Texas offensive line will stop 
Alabama’s own 365-pound Godzilla 
Terrance Cody when it couldn’t keep 
Ndamukong Suh, listed as 60 pounds 
lighter than Cody, away from McCoy.

Possibly the most interesting sto-
ryline, though, is the SEC’s complete 
dominance. The SEC claims four of 
the past five national championships 
and half of the national championships 
crowned during the BCS-era of college 
football. In fact, no SEC team has ever 
lost a BCS National Championship —  
they’ve got a perfect 5-0 record. 

So what the hell are they feeding 
their kids in the South? I want some. 
According to its official Web site, 
Alabama’s roster has only five players 
from non-SEC participating states. 
That’s some good homegrown cookin’. 

I could go on forever about the nit-
ty-gritty, but tonight’s game will come 
down to three key match-ups:

1) Texas’ Passing Game vs. 

Alabama’s Defense: With their quar-
terback as their biggest rushing threat, 
an inept running game has forced 
Texas to rely solely on its passing game. 
If Cody is able to bulldoze through 
the Longhorn offensive line like Suh 
did, McCoy will be pressured into 
another subpar Nebraska-esque show-
ing. Linebacker Rolando McClain will 
likely be in charge of keeping McCoy 
from scrambling. As one of the most 
sure tacklers in the nation, it’s cake 
for McClain if he really is as healthy 
as reports suggest. But even if the 
Longhorn O-line can keep Saban’s clev-
er blitz packages and Cody out of the 
backfield, McCoy will still have to com-
pete with one of the best secondaries in 
the nation. No matter how you look at 
it, the Texas offense will have a difficult 
time putting up its 40 points per game 
… which leads to number two.

2) Greg McElroy of late vs. Greg 
McElroy of midseason: Which one 
we get is anyone’s guess. The Alabama 
quarterback’s season has been adequate, 
and a stereotypical stingy SEC defense 
has bailed him out on more than one 
occasion. Should McCoy and the 
‘Horns rack up points, McElroy and the 
Tide offense can keep pace if McElroy 
plays like he has recently. Many doubted 
he could capably fill in for former quar-
terback John Parker Wilson. Of late, 

McElroy has proved that he was worth 
the wait. But doubt creeps in when I 
recall a three-game mid-season stretch 
during where McElroy couldn’t find 
his rhythm, completing 43 of 85 passes 
with no touchdowns and two intercep-
tions. If McElroy comes out trying to 
prove something, he could find himself 
back in his mid-year slump.

3) Alabama Red Zone Defense vs. 
Texas Red Zone Offense: Texas rates 
third in the nation in red zone offense, 
scoring on 53 of 56 drives inside the 
20-yard line. With a reliable kicker in 
Hunter Lawrence and McCoy at the 
helm, Texas has found a way to score. 
Problem is, it has to get there first. 
Alabama ranks third in total defense, 
averaging a measly 241.69 yards per 
game. And even if the Longhorns’s 
offense manages to sneak its way deep 
into Tide territory, it may encounter 
even stouter defense. Alabama has the 
second best red zone defense, allowing 
only eight touchdowns in 23 drives. 
Something has to give in the Battle of 
the Red Zone. The winner will likely 
take home the title.

The end of the holiday season 
couldn’t offer a better gift: a true nation-
al championship with a high-powered 
offense, a shutdown defense and future 
pros all over the field. May the game 
give us everything we hoped for.

petition they will face at the National 
Championships. Last year at the compe-
tition, UCSD and Truman State finished 
third and fourth respectively.  

“It’s been a couple months before 
we’ve had a meet,” McGihon said. “We 
were definitely eager to swim again. 
It’s rare that we get to swim against an 
established Division-II program, so we 
wanted to take the opportunity to do 
well.”

Sophomore swimmer Alexandra 
Henley said she was pleasantly sur-

prised at how well the team performed, 
especially coming off a two-month 
break from competition.

“The meet was good for everyone 
to see where we were at,” Henley said. 
“It was also a good way to start the 
month, because this Saturday we’re up 
against Loyola Marymount University 
— a big rival — and we can go into 
it with heads high and beat them as 
well.”

LMU and UCSD have always com-
peted fiercely against each other, but 
McGihon said the team is keeping this 

meet in perspective, putting their sights 
to the greater season goal.

“We’re focusing more on the nation-
al champions than anything else,” 
McGihon said. “But this is a really big 
rivalry, so we’re going to give it our best 
effort.”

On the same day, immediately fol-
lowing the meet against LMU, the wom-
en’s team will be racing against Kansas 
University.

The senior team captain took gold in the women’s foil at 
the Bladerunner tournament, from Jan. 2 to Jan. 3. This 
marks the second consecutive year that Alicea has won the 
tournament, which hosts over 200 competitors.

PILAR ALICEA I FENCING

Staff Writer

SWIMMING & DIVING — After 
coming out highly competitive 
in 2009 with pre-season fixtures, 
conference play and several multi-
school tournaments, the Triton men 
and women got an equally fresh 
start in 2010 with a whopping vic-
tory over Division-II powerhouse 
Truman State University.

“[Truman] has been a strong 
winning program for five to six 
years now, so it was great to get 
that opportunity to compete against 
them,” head coach Scott McGihon 
said.

The men’s team scored a decisive 
228-30 victory against the Bulldogs, 
winning all 14 events. The Triton 
women took 13 of 14 events, and 
won by a margin of 184.5-77.5.

“We were really happy about how 
we swam against them,” McGihon 
said. “And it may have looked like 
the score was a little lopsided, but 
they’re going to be ready to swim 
fast at the national championships, 
so it’s not like we’re going to let up 
by any means.”

The meet, which the Tritons 
hosted over winter break, was decid-
ed very early on in the match-up. 
Freshman Katherine Tse (50 free, 
100 free), junior Anju Shimura 
(100 back, 200 back), freshman 
Beth Dong (1,000 free, 500 free) 
and sophomore Alex Henley (200 
IM, 200 free) all won two indi-
vidual events on the women’s side. 
In the men’s division, senior Jereme 
Barnett-Woods (1,000 free, 500 

free), freshman Julius Espiritu (100 
back, 200 back) and senior Daniel 
Perdew (50 free, 100 fly) each won 
multiple events.

After the recess, UCSD swim-
mers followed up their dominant 
individual displays with a collab-

orative relay effort that smashed the 
competition.

The emphatic win against 
Truman State gave the Tritons an 
idea of the kind of high-level com-

Winter break is my favorite time of year. And it isn’t because of family, the 
chilly weather or the fact that I can 
stare at the wall every day without 
having to think anything scholastic. 
No, what I love most about the holi-
day season is that it allows me to get 
away from my family, stay indoors 
and stare at something other than a 
wall: college football. 

I laugh when 94 percent of 
America picks Houston to beat Air 
Force, but the Falcons dominate with 
their option attack. I cry when my 
hometown team Fresno State loses 
in double overtime after a ridiculous 
goal-line play call that should be get-
ting Pat Hill fired — not what will 
likely result in a multi-million dollar 
extension. I nearly fall to the floor 
from a heart attack when Bowling 
Green, Idaho and the Roady’s 
Humanitarian Bowl makes for more 
fireworks than a Disneyland Fourth 
of July display.

This rollercoaster of emotion will 
come to a halt tonight when Alabama 
meets Texas for the BCS National 
Championship. Hate the Bowl 
Championship Series system or love 
it, they got it right this year. Despite 
Boise State’s second perfect season in 
three years, the team wouldn’t sur-
vive a full season in the Southeastern 
Conference or the Big 12 like `Bama 
and Texas did. The Rolling Tide and 
the Longhorns are the nation’s two

FENCING — While their fellow 
Tritons were coveting the last few days 
of the holiday break, the UCSD fenc-
ers started off 2010 with a dominat-
ing performance at the 14th annual 
Bladerunner tournament held Jan. 2 
and Jan. 3 at UCSD.  

Open for all fencers part of the 
United States Fencing Association, the 
competition brought in top individu-
als from some of the most elite clubs 
in California. Senior team captain 
Pilar Alicea took gold in the women’s 
foil for the second consecutive year 
at the event. Freshman Alex Lavin, 
competing in the epee event for only 
the second time in his short career, 
placed eighth, earning him a reputable 
C rating.

The tournament  —hosted by 
UCSD as a fundraiser to help the 
team pay for travel and registration 
fees —featured over 200 competitors 
with fencers as young as 16 and as old 
as 63. Bladerunners hosted some of 
the best fencers in the state in addition 
to an individual from the Ukrainian 
national team.

Since strong competition was the 
perfect opportunity for the Tritons 
to reignite their competitive spirit, 
they weren’t able to hold any practices 
over the holidays. Without any prac-
tice time, Alicea didn’t expect such a 
strong performance. 

“I was a little concerned about the 
timing of the tournament,” Alicea said. 
“That being said, I was impressed with 
the team’s overall performance.”

Alicea continues a stellar fall cam-
paign, which included a victory at the 
Collegiate Open and an undefeated run 
in competitions against UCLA, USC, 
UC Santa Barbara and Arizona State. 

Other Triton women turned in 
top performances as well. Freshman 
Victoria Mo placed third in the 
women’s epee and senior Alicia 
Trigeiro took eighth in women’s 
saber. Freshman Rose Forcier claimed 
bronze in the women’s foil with senior 
Razan Faraj placing eighth.

For the men, freshman Chris 
Bonner took fifth in the men’s saber. 
UCSD took three of the top eight 
spots in men’s foil with sophomore 
Michael Fong, junior Benjamin Dorn 
and freshman Nalin Desai finishing 
fifth, sixth and eighth respectively. 
Sophomore Patrick Burton finished 
seventh in men’s epee, with Levin one 
spot behind.

Usually competing in the foil com-
petition, Levin recently decided he 
would try his hand at epee. In only 
his second outing, Levin’s eighth place 

finish earned him a C rating, some-
thing that usually takes years to do, 
according Alicea.

Now in its 14th year, the 
Bladerunner tournament has seen 
the number of competitors steadily 
increase, and is bringing in better 
competition and more money. With 
each year, the intensity of the back-
to-school tournament has risen, 
providing an excellent platform for 
the Tritons to hone their individual 
skills in preparation for the North 
American Cup D Jan. 15 through Jan. 
18 in San Jose.

The Tritons will send only a hand-
ful of fencers to the event that features 

individuals from all over the nation 
and world. UCSD will be represented 
in all events at the tournament. 

Team competition will resume Jan. 
30 and Jan. 31 at the Northwestern 
Duals that will feature tough Division-I 
competition. 

“Working with the team this year 
has been incredible, and I look for-
ward to seeing what more we can 
achieve during the rest of our season,” 
Alicea said.
