AS. presidential candidates Coleen 
Sabatini and Greg Hearn won 45.4 perce~ and 27.5 
percent of the student vote, respectively, and will 
compete in run-off election scheduled for April 17.

UC Berkeley Admits Existence of VIP Admissions Committee 
PREFERENCE: 
Committee has handled 
more than 200 requests 
By Suketu Va.shnav 
Staff Writer 

Recent investigations by several 
news organizations into UC 
Berkeley's admis ions procedures 
have uncovered a special commit-
tee at the chool for handling admls-
ions requests on behalf of influen-

tial figures ranging from U.S. sena-
tors to OC regents. 

According to the Los Angeles 

Times, more than 200 students have 
received some type of "special con-
sideration" from the UC Berkeley 
committee since 1993. In addition, 
the Times reported that 19 of the 
tudents in question would not h..lve 

been admitted under standard ad-
missions criteria. 

In the wake of the findings, UC 
officials acknowledged that the ad-
missions committee, which has re-
viewed the requests of various high-
ranking UC officials, state and fed-
eral legislators, donors and others, 
has been in existence since the 19808. 

Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien de-

fended the university against the 
recent charges leveled by the Times 
and other members of the media in a 
statement released last week. 

"All in titutions of higher edu-
cation need some flexibility to take 
actions and make decisions that ben-
efit the university as a whole," Tien 
wrote. 

Berkeley officials said they have 
received 240 special requests dur-
ing the last four years. Of these, 204 
cases progre sed through tandard 
channels with no special interven-
tion. 

"If these cases were not reviewed, 

the likelihood is that they would 
have been denied," UC Berkeley 
Assistant Chancellor JohnCummins 
told the Times. 

As far as UCSD is concerned, 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph Watson denied that favor-
able admissions policies exist for 
"well-connected" students seeking 
admi sion to thi university. 

"All students should be regarded 
by the same criteria," Watson aid. 
"We have reviewed admission pro-
cedure .... We have no special com-
mittee for VIP reque I ; we main-

ing an annual cultural celebration is a

According to Muir senior Siamak.

per year is not going to resolve the 
problems stemming from a lack of 
cultural awareness.

By Me"enne VIlli 
Senior Staff Writer 

More than lOOUCSDstaffmem-

Faculty Club for the 11th annual 
Staff Employee of the Year awards 
ceremony, in which 10 of the ap-
proximately 13 ,000 UCSD staff 
members were honored for their out-
standing achievements in the work-
place.

trator at the UCSD

coordi nates educalional workshops. 
teaches breast self-exam classes and 
writes and plays music for many 
campus events. 

Shinagawa received $I.SOO and 
a nu mber of gi ft certificates for cam-
pus stores and restaurants in addi-
tion to a framed certificate from 
Interim Chancellor Marjorie 
Caserio. 

Nine other employees were hon-
ored for their "exemplary service." 
Each recei ved framed certificates 
and $750. 

One recipient, Edna Fugazzi of

been a UCSD em-
Cancer Center, was 
honored as the Em-
ployee of the Year 
for excellence on t.he 
job and for her vol-
unteer contributions 
to programs for can-
cer survi vors. As a 
cancer survivor, 
Shinagawa said she 
saw first-hand the 
need for support of 
those who have suf-

"I am really on a 
mission to h.lp 
peopl. _ that 

ployee for more 
than 20 years. Ac-
cording to one of 
Fugazzi's co-
workers, "Her fun -
damental objecti ve 
is customer satis-
faction." 

there Is good 
that can com. 
out of Fugazzi has

elevator, every piece of air condi-
tioning, every fire alarm and every 
elec trical circuit on the campus," 
according to one of hiS co-workers. 

Though Griffith said the award 
simply illustrates the fine quality of 
the people who work for him, those

pride "that pervades every acti vity 
and [is instilled in] every mechanic."

the campus police department. 

Glenn Ketchum of Environmental 
Health and Safety oversees laboratory 
afety on campu . He was de cribed by 

a co-worker as "a service-oriented prob-
lem solver who finds simple solutions 
to complex problems." He has also 
been called "a fresh breath of common 
sense in a regulatory maze." 

Carl Middaugh of the psychology 
department described his 32-year ca-
reer at UCSD as "an old man 's dream." 
His co-workers noted that he "helps 
with security di lemmas, changes 
wheels on animals racks, designs and 
fabricates ergonomically safe computer 
stands and unjams fax machines." Of 
his three decades of service, Middaugh 
said, "I get paid to putter." 

Human Subjects Program Director 
Luci lle Pearson was recognized for her 
oversight of an estimated I, 100 new 
research project each year. 

Gail Smith of the Marine Physical 
Laboratory (MPL) supervises all re-
mote secretarial services at MPL and is 
responsible for an academic slaff of 
nearly 130 people. ln addition to her 
dedication to her work, she has also 
opened up her home to nine long-term 
students and 21 short-term students,

Do ·the law and the court 
system fairly consider 
everyone's cases? 

MINORITIES 
SINGLED OUT 

According to a recent study by the 
Center on Juvenile and riminal Jus-
tice, 39 percent of California's black 
men are involved in the criminal -
justice system. These men are not 

lawyer~ or judges. however. but 
rather inmate~ and crimina ls on 
probation . This involvement 
rosses gender lines, a 1995 study 
by the Sentencing Project cites that 
from 1989 to 1994, black women havc 
experienced a 78-percent increase in in-
volvement with the criminal-justice system 
-the largest increase of any demographic group. The 
vast over-representation of blacks in the this sy tem is 
due to inherently racist government policies and laws, 
especially those add res ing drug enforcement. 

In the rail of 1989, President Bush presented a $7.8 
billion anti-drug program called the National Drug 
Control Strategy, or more popularly, the War on Drugs. 
To begin 10 understand the implicit purpose of this 
project, one must eltamine the strategy Bush employed 
to gamer suppon for the costly effect. 

Bush argued Ihatthe drug epidemic in America was 
so out of hand that crack cocaine could be bought 
across the street from the White House in Lafayelle 
Park. Prior to this announcement, however, no one had 
ever been arrested for selling crack at that location. In 
order to substantiate the president's claim, Drug En-
forcement Agency (DEA) agents actually had to con-
vince an 18-year-old black male, Keith Jackson, into 
coming to Lafayette Park to sell them spme crack. 

Monday, April 15, 1~6 

When approached with the proposition, Jackson 
responded that he did not know where Lafayette Park 
was. When told iL was across the street from the White 
House, Jackson said he did not know what the White 
House was. In the end, a government agent had Lo give 
Ja~k son a ride to the park, where the DEA attempted 
to arrest him for drug trafficking. 

LOGIC SHOWS THAT STATISTICS MEAN NOTHING 

Oddly, the agents had to make two buys from Jack-
son because during the first buy, the agent who was 
supposed to film the incident was attacked by a home-
less person. A,fter the second buy, agents tried to ar· 
rest Jackson, but they lost him somewhere in the park. 
Jackson left the area and wu finally arrested 21 days 
after President Bush delivered his speech about the 
drug cri is in Amcrk:a. 
, Toda" Jacklon is in prison - without the possi-
bility of parole until 2001 - the homeless still live in 
Lafayette Park, and the War on Dru, is still.ttacking

Racism is an ugly word which de-
scribes an ugly topic. lIS impacts can be 
felt from coast to coast, as people claim 
to be vic:tims of racist hiring practices, a 
racisl country, or a racist judicial system. 
While racism used to mean condemning 
decent folk who are trying to be served 
at a lunch counter or sit where they 
choose on a public bus, it now means 
convicted felons who are trying to paint 
themselves as victims of a prejudiced ju-
dicial system. 

These "victims" have lawyers who 
play with statistics and whine to judges 
and juries about the racial disparity 
within the American legal system, u 
their clients shed crocodile tears. In re-
ality, it's all just a bunch of cleverly peck. 

aged hooey. While no system is perfect, 
the American legal system comes close, 
dispensing equal, even-handed justice in 
the overwhelming majority of court 
cases, regardless of the race of parties 
involved. 

Logically speaking, it is the IICCUSCf'S 
obligation to prove the existence of a 
crime; it is not the responsibility of the 
defense to disprove it. This concept 
agrees with the American legal position 
that an individual is "innocent until 
proven guilty." Bearing the plaintiff's 
burden of proof in mind, let's examine a 
few cues in which racism has been al-
lept. 

One of the loudest complaints of the 
misguided race-bailers concerns the 

death penalty, posing poignant questions 
about its efficacy. How is it that blacks 
convicted of murder outnumber whites 
by a ratio of approximately eightto one? 
Why did blacks account for 39.6 percent 
of all death sentences from 1977 to 1991 
when they only const i tute 12 percent of 
the population? Unless the racial com-
position of condemned criminals exactly 
minors that of society at large, it must 
be discrimination, right? Wrong. . 

This kind of logic is vacuous and 
implies that members of a particular 
group will act in a concerted fashion, fill-
ing the required quota for crimes com-

. mined and then cease the activity. It

COMMENTARY: Masquerading as political reform, Proposition 198 is an unconstitutional grab for power by 
moderates who feel that only they should determine who gets nominated by our main political parties. 

OPEN PRIMARIES DAMAGE THE POLITICAL PROCESS 
By Nathan Pietila 
Staff W"ter 

Judging from the analy.sis in the 
newspapers, the most nOlewonhy 
aspect about the recent primary 
election in California was the 
record-low voter turnout. Secretary 
of State Bill Jones estimated that 
only 40 percent of registered voters 
bothered to ca t ballots on election 
day. This was three percentage 
points lower than the old record-low 
during California's 1940 p'residen-
tial primary, which that year did not 
coincide with the state's own pri-
mary. 

Analysts blame the low turnout 
on a lack of polarizing issues or can-
didates on the ballot. By the time 
March 26 came around, Bob Dole 
had all but wrapped up the Repub-
lican nomination. Similarly, Bill 
Clinton faced no primary challenges 
this year. There were also no prima-
ries for either a U.S. Senate seat or 
for governor. 

It's hard to know what to make 
of low voter turnout. There were 
more than a half-dozen propositions 
on the ballot, many of which 
prompted vigorous campaigning by 
assoned special interests. But this 
slate of initiatives wasn't incentive 

enough for voters to head to the 
polls . Perhaps this points to an 
alarming apathy and lack of civic 
responsibility on the pan of voters. 
On the other hand, perhaps it is the 
political system itself which has dis-
enchanted voters. Whichever posi-
tion one holds , the conventional 
wisdom is that omething must be 
done about this woeful situation. 

One idea offered by reform-
minded citizens is the open primary. 
Proposition 198, which did pass, 
removes the requirement for voters 
to be registered with a panicular 
party in order to vote in that 
organization'S primary. Beginning 
with the 1998 primary election, ev-
ery voter in California will be given 
a ballot with the names of all the 
candidates running in each pany. 
The voter will then have the oppor-
tunity to vote for anyone candidate, 
regardless of party affiliation. 

The idea behind this initiative is 
to enfranchise independent voters, 
the so-called "sensible center" of the 
electorate. It is thought that extend-
ing the vote to these people will 
have a moderating effect on the 
choice of party nominees for the 
general election. 

There are , however, myriad

posing pany ' primary. Democrats 
could vote for the most extreme (i.e. 
the most unelectable) Republican 
candidate, and vice versa. It 's an 
open question whether this behav-
ior would more than off etthe mod-
erating voice of independent votcrs, 
but it is still a troubling one. David 
Duke, for instance, was chosen as 
Louisiana's open-primary Republi -
can nominee for governor in 1991 . 

Second, depending on the direc-
tion in which independent voters are 
leaning in a given year, the outcome 
of an election could largely be de-
termined during the primary. If in-
dependent V1>ters are leaning left, 
then they will tend to vote for mod-
erate Democrats in the primary. This 
leaves the Republican primary be-
reft of the moderate voice which the 
open-primary system was meant to 
upply. A similar argument holds 

when independent voters lean to the 
right. 

Given that primaries are known 
for their lack of meaningful politi-
cal debate, it is easy to see how this 
situation is undesirable. In an open 
primary, the choice in the general 
election becomes one between a 
moderate in one pany and a more 
extreme candidate in the other. Is 

there any doubt as to who might win 
this hypothetical contest'! 

Lastly, the most significant prob-
lem with the open primary is its vio-
lation of one of our 010 t basic 
rights: freedom of association. We 
seem to have forgotten that politi-
cal parties are private organizations. 
Because they are private organiza-
tions, political panies have the right 
to determine their own membership 
and decide who has the right to vote 
in their primary_ The open primary 
violates the free-assembly clause of 
the First Amendment because it'Sub-
verts the freedom of each party to 
make these decisions. Lawsuits 
have already been filed against the 
open primary, and party leaders are 
fairly confident that Proposition 198 
will be thrown out. 

Aside from these troubling prob-
lems, suppose advocates of the open 
primary are correct. Suppose that 
RepUblican and Democratic candi-
dates tum out to be more moderate. 
Is this a good thing? California GOP 
Chairman John Herrington doesn't 
think so.

RACISM: War

Continued from pc. 4 
the black community. 

In procuring the Jackson inci-
dent, President Bush subtly elicited 
racial stereotypes of black men as 
criminals. And the incident further 
incited racial fears because of the 
media-hyped correlation between 
bladts, crack c~aine and violence. 
Bush used the threat of crack-co-
caine trafficking to play upon racial 
stereotypes and gain support for the 
War on Drugs' aggressive tactics. If 
he could convince the American 
public thaI the drug problem was, 
in essence, a black problem, para-
military efforts would be more ac-
ceptable to the public. 

Forty percent of the funding for 
the War on Drugs is dedicated to in-
creasing law-enforcement activity, 
while only 14 percent goes toward 
treatment. Twenty-two percent 
funds interdiction and 12 percent 
targets education. In at least 18 
stales by 1990. ''boot camps" had 
been implemented for first-time, 
youth drug offenders. The boot 

camps had various titles, including 
Special Altemative Incarceration, 
Disciplinary Rehabilitation, Chal-
lenge Incarceration and Shock In-
carceration. 

In the Michigan boot camp, the 
youths are called "maggots" and 
"quitters" if they do not demonstrate 
sufficiently obedient behavior. Most 
boot camps use harsh manual labor 
as one tool of discipline. Not sur-
prisingly. the boot camps are prima-
rily composed of black and Latino 
youth. The War on Drugs has par-
ticularly targeted the black commu-
nity, creating what Diana R. Gordon 
of the Community University of 
New York Graduate Center calls a 
Million-Man March into the 
country's penal institutions, caused 
by the harsh sentenci ng for crack-
cocaine offenses. 

The over-representation of 
blacks in prison for drug crimes can 
be explained, in part, by laws which 
administer harsher sentences for the 
types of drugs present in the black 
community. Mandatory minimum 
sentences for such crimes were a lib-
eral effort to equalize sentencing 
that, typically. is negatively influ-
enced by race. But the results of 
these efforts has not changed sen-

Since 1988, possession of five 
grams of crack cocaine worth about 
$125 has a five-year mandatory 
minimum sentence, while it takes 
500 grams of powder cocaine worth 
$SO.OOO to receive the same sen-
tence. This law is race-blind in its 
language, but racist in its outcome; 
because, according to a 1990 Com-
mon Cause study. 92 percent of 
those arrested for crack possession 
are black, and 95 percent of those 
arrested for possessing powder co-
caine are white.

while blacks comprise 13 percent of 
the U.S. population and 13 percent 
of monthly drug users. they repre-
sent 35 percent of those arrested for 
drug possession, SS percent of those 
convicted for possession and 74 
percent of the total serving sen-
tences for possession. These figures 
are striking considering that the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse's 
study in 1990 found that of the esti-
mated 13 percent of illegal drug us-
ers. 15 percent were black, eight 
percent Latino and 77 percent white. 
Race is a detennining factor in ar-
rests, prosecution and sentencing. 

On Feb. 13, 1996, the Los Angt-
Its Tunes cited the most recent study 
by the Center on Juvenile and 
Criminal Justice: "At almost every 
stage of the criminal justice process, 
whites fare better than African-
Americans or LatiIlOS. One-third of 
whites who are first-time offenders 
had charges reduced, compared to 
one-quarter of blacks and Latinos. 
Whites received rehabilitative 
placements in the community at 
twice the rate of African-Americans 
and Lati nos. " 

In the face of such statistics, one 
would have to be either blind or asi-
nine to argue that race is not a fac-

No law ill the criminal-justice sys-

tem. stale or federal, explicitJy states 
a racist agenda. but examining who 
is targeted by the system uncovers a 
very different purpose. In January of 
1991 , The Christimt Scienct Monitor 
found that black males in the United 
States are "incarceraled at a rate four 
times that of Black males in South 
Africa [where apartheid was a state 
policy]: 3,109 per 100.000 black 
males. compared with 729 under 
apartheid." What reasonable person 
can read such a fact and deny that the 
American judicial system is en-
trenched in racism? 

The United States openly criti -
cized and rejected the practice of 
institutionalized racism and op-
pression in pre-Mandela South 
Africa. However, our modern 
"race-neutral" laws and policies 
carry a sub text and sub-purpose 
which ri val and, in the case of the 
criminal-justice system, exceed 
those of South' Africa. There has 
always been a brutal discrepancy 
between what is stated in Ameri-
can law and what is actually prac-
ticed. Equality within the law does 
not necessarily mean equality un-

only 49 percent of Ihe popUlation? 
Is there some sexist bias against

The sheer absurdity of the argu-
ment is obvious. Women don ' I com-

Another example involves serial

offenders are white males. Does this

many Asian. Hispanic and black

think that "the middle way" is the 
answer to our country's woes? 

The answer lies in the fact thaI 
we are all too aware of the mean-
spiritedness of the political process. 
Building a coalition in a nation of 
250 million people is an arduous 
process demanding a great deal of 
compromise . That's why Ross 
Perot's "Iet's get things done" atti-
tude is so disturbing. Ross Perot and 
the moderates he represenls want

where crimes are more likely to oc-
cur are simply doing their job -
fighting crirne. They are too busy 
dodging bullets to worry about the 
race of the person who is firing at 
them. 

A final argumer., to deconstruct 
claims of alleged ' racism centers 
around the notion that blacks tend 
to receive harsher sentences for kill-
ing whites than they do for killing 
other blacks. This too is a lrueclaim, 
but not because racism is involved. 
The circumstances surrounding 
such crimes need closer inspection 
before :lny accur~te conclusions 
may be drawn. 

When a murder involves people 
of different races, the probability 
that the perpetrator and the victim 
were unacquainted is muc;h greater 
than if they are of the same race. 
When a stranger kills another 
stranger. the context of the crime is 
often burglary or robbery. When a 
person is killed by someone he 

want power just as much as do Demo-
crats or Republicans. 

Perot's group.. bashes the ideologi-
cal polarization of the two parties 
while subtly introducing an ideology 
of its own. The world in general, and 
politics in particul .... is driven by ide-
ology. All of us have ideologies which 
we use to help us make sense of the 
world. The pipe dream that we can 
deal with this wide array of ideologies 
"y rejecting ~ so-called extremes is 
just a pernicious invention of the m0d-
erate power grab. 

OPINION 7 

knows, it is often family or drug 
related. Crimes in the fonner cat-
egory are treated more harshly un-
der the law because the victims are 
perceived to be innocent bystand-
ers, not because juries take greater 
offense to blacks killing whites as 
opposed to blacks killing blacks. A 
white person is far more likely to 
be murdered by a stranger who i 
of another race than is a black per-
son. 

Looking more closely at the ar-
eas of supposed racism yields a 
clearer picture, one in1which crime 
is punished and race is not a factor. 
The American legal system does its 
utmost to ensure equal justice un-
der the law. In the vast majority of 
cases, there is equality. The "racial-
bias" crowd deludes itself into see-
ing racism around every tum and 
tries to make victims out of preda-
torS. Criminals should get what they 
deserve; lock them up and throw 
away the key. 

Our political culture today is 
plagued by whining and laziness. 
Instead of gelling involved in 
party politics or actively engag-
ing in political debate, indepen-
dent vote" follow the conven-
tional wisdom that our parties are 
too extreme. Hence the appear-
ance of hare-brained ideas like 
Proposition 198. The "system" 
isn't the root af our political pr0b-
lems; it is the intellec:tuaI shallow-
ness of our policy, our policy-
makers and ourselves as voters.

Muir Student Appeals Case to Judicial Board 
ALCOHOL: Board 
upholds Residential 
Life Office's sanctions 
By Mery HlaJM 

Although Whittington did not find 
any alcohol in Frey's apartment, nor 
did he witness Frey consuming any 
alcohol, the judicial board upheld the 
resident dean's decision.

Staff Writer 
Several dozen students rallied be-

hind Muir sophomore Michael Frey 
at a Muir Residential Life Judicial 
Board hearing on April II. which was 
held to address a February 17 incident 
involving Frey and Residential Secu-
rity Officer Josh Whittington. 

Whittington 
told the board he 
arrived at Frey's 
apartment at ap-
prox:imately2:30 
a.m. after being 
told that Frey had 
been locked out 
of his room. Frey 
then allowed 
Whittington to 
enter the apart-
ment. leading 
him down the 
hall to his bed-

he did not comply. Frey removed the 
blanket, revealing several cardboard 
beer cases containing empty beer 
bottles and cans. Aware that no one in 
Frey's apartment was over2 I yearsof 
age, Whittington reportedly wrote 
Frey up and left the apartment. 

At Thursday's hearing, Frey 
claimed he should not have been put 
on probation, calling most of 
Whittington's story a "fai ry tale." Frey 
denied that there were any cups or ice 
bags in the bathroom, although he 
confirmed most of the other infonna-
tion. Frey requested the hearing after he 

was placed on probation by MuirResi-
dent Dean Pat Danylyshyn-Adams. 

Frey claimed that he was not only 
unjustly accused of violating univer-
sity or campus alcohol regUlations, 
but also that his right to privacy had 
been violated.

According to Frey, he had col-
lected the beer cans and bottles the 
previou night from a party in an 
acquaintance's apartment with the 
intent of recycling them. After bring-
ing the empty beverage containers 
back to his apartment, Frey concealed 
them beneath a blanket, at the recom-
mendation of a roommate, so that he 
would not be violating the campus 
policy which forbids the use of alco-
holic beverages or beverage contain-
ers as decoration. 

'This is endemic of what goes on 
around this place," Muir sophomore 
and former A.S. Commissioner of 
Student Advocacy Sou ley Diallo said.

Controver. y over UC admis-
sions policies Oared up initially 
when the Times discovered that 
several UC regents, who had pre-
viously voted against " preferen-
tIal" affi rmati ve-action Initiatives , 
used theIr political clout to help 
admit friends and relatives into 
UCLA . 

Among those making admis-
sions requests was UC Regent and 
anti -affirmative-ac tion leader 

Ward Connerly. According to the 
Times, Connerly presented two 
names for "special consideration" 
to UCB this year alone. 

In an interview with the Times 
Wednesday, Connerly sai d he was 
unaware that the applicants' names 
were forwarded to any special 
committee at Berkeley after hand-
ing the applications to UCB's 
chancellor at a UC regents meet-
ing. 

"The mere fact that those let -
ters passed through my hands cre-
ates the impre sion that some sort 
of inOuence was sought, when in 
fact none was ," Connerly told the 
Times.

up," he added. 

Connerly also said that the spe-
cial-request committee at Berke-

ley should be abolished. 
According to Gov . Pete 

Wilson ' press sec retary , Sean 
Walsh, the governor does not con-
done practices involving "specjal 
consideration" for certain appli-
cants . 

"[Wi Ison] doesn't believe there 
should be a special committee set 
up at any UC campus to confer 
political or preferential treatment 
to any student," he said. 

In addition, three members of 
Congre s, including Senator Bill 
Bradley , O-New Jersey , allegedly 
submitted special requests 10 the 
Berkeley campus, the Times re-
ported. 

According to the Times. spe-
cial-admissions requests were also

prevalent at UCLA. Tien said that 
in 1991, h~ made a special request 
to UCLA officials on behalf of a 
retired business executive who 
h'eaded a major Berkeley 
fundraising drive. 

At UCLA, special requests were 
funneled either through Chancel-
lor Charles E. Young's office or 
the sc hool' s fundraising staff. No 
special committee existed to deal 
with special requests. 

"At least [Berkeley] officials 
are out in the open about it," UC 
Regent Ralph Carmona told the

Berkeley officials said there

violated because Whittington unlaw-
fully "searched" his apartment after 
unlocking the bedroom door, and did 
not leave until after Frey asked him to 
do so on "numerous" occasions. 

According to UCSO Police Ser-
geant David Rose, who was present at 
the hearing, it was legal for Whittington 
to enter Frey 's apartment because he 
was invited in by Frey . 

The hearing came down to a case 
ofWhillington's word against Frey's: 
Frey denied Whittington 's claim that 
omeone had asked if the place was 

cleaned up, while Whittington said he 
had no recollecllon of bei ng asked to 
leave the apartment.

WhIttington's report, were 'oulflcient

Adams' decision to place Frey on

'This proves exactly what we' ve 
been saying," Frey said. 'The Oudi-
cial board] was a complete Mickey 
Mouse court, orchestrated by the 
HAs." 

Some of those on hand at 
Thursday's hearing expressed disap-
pointment over the board' s decision. 

"I think this [hearing) is a reflec-
tion of the students ' real position in 
campus politics - their rights can be 
infringed upon by the security guards 
and residential life," Muir sophomore 
T. Alan Rogers said. 

Board members were unable to 
comment due to a confidentiality re-

The purpose of the judicial board.

'The goa l i ~ to have it not happen

The women's varsily-fourboat had 
a good showing in what Vallerga

The Tritons placed fourth among 13 
boats and were less than half a boat 
length out of the bronze. 

In the novice category, the UCSD 
women entered crews in both the A-
eight and B-eight divisions. 

The A squad managed a respect-

Hey

SPORTS 15 

we get a little help here? 
On the men's side, two crews were 

entered, both of which were at the 
novice level. The novice-eight boat 
earned fourth place in a race won by 
meet champion UC Davis. 

The novice-four crew, meanwhile, 
also reac~ the grand final and earned 
a bronze for their efforts, outlasting all 
but two of the 15 teams. 

"This was a good mid-season 
check," Vallerga said. "We were very 
pleased [that) our lowest finish was 
still in the grand final ." 

Editor-In-Chief Wanted

keep pace with his highly decorated 
teammate. 

Finally came a pair of solid 
showings from senior stalwart 
Derek Benneu, who grabbed first 
place in the open high jump (6 '2") 
and the invitational ' B' 110m 
hurdles (15.96). 

Tim Prudence was right on the 
heels of Bennell in the hurdles, 
taking second in 16.27.

Tritons Slug Out Two Wins 
REBOUND: UCSD earned victories over Claremont and UCSC to get back on track 
By Robin Kezlrl8n 
Staff Writer 

The UCSO women's tennis team ex-
tended its season record to 11 -6 with 
victories over UC Santa Cruz and 

Claremont College last 
week, after losing a disap-
pointing match in Arizona 
two weekends ago. 

The double-faulting 
epidemic which plagued 
the Triton squad during 
its recent loss to Gustavus 
was remedied in practice 

priorto Thursday's contest against Sama 
Cruz. 

"We reali zed we didn ' t playas well 
as we can, and we really needed to work 
on serving," Head Coach Liz LaPlante 
said . ' 'The girls hit buckets and buckets 
of serves to get their confidence back." 

UCSD's aggressive doubles teams 
earned a 3-0 advantage at the outset of 
the match. The top-seeded tandem of 
Miki Kurokawa and Yumi Takemoto 
overpowered its opponents early, claim-
ing a 3-0 advantage in the first set. 

The pair's Santa Cruz counterparts 
refused to go quietly, however, storm-
ing back to win the next two games. 

return at the opposing net player to force 
an errant hit. 

Enjoying a 40-15 lead, the TritoJl 
team proceded to play defensively. 
Kurokawa and Takemoto were P!lshed 
back to the baseline by a short lob, but 
they recovered and eventually hit a pass-
ing shot just between the Banana Slug 
players to win the pivitol game. 

Having halted its opponent 's mo-
mentum, the Triton team raced to the 
finish , claiming the victory, 8-2. 

Michelle Malephansakul and Susan 
Huberman performed equally well at 
the number-two position, carrying a 7-4 
lead into the pro set before fin-ally turn-
ing things up a notch. 

Huberman won the first point of the 
game with a volley winner on the cross, 
while Malephansakul served-and-vol-
leyed for the next three points and the 
eventual match win. 

Although the number-three team, 
comprised of Hilary Somers and Annie 
Hoecker, faced much weaker opponents, 
it did not compromise its superior level 
ofpl;ty, taking the victory, 8-4. 

Sweeping the doubles matches 
proved es ential for the Tritons, who 
split the singles matches with Santa 
Cruz before winning the match, 6-3. 

Claremont College for the second time 
this season, 7-2. 

While the injury-ridden number-one 
doub1es team ofKurokawa and Takemoto 
was defeated, Malephansalrul/Huberman 
and SomersIHoecker claimed wins over 
their Claremont counterparts at the num-
ber-two and number-three positions, re-
spectively. 

Saturday' s play was highlighted by 
outstanding performances in the second 
and sixth singles positions. Number-
two Kurokawa and number-six Hoecker 
both defeated opponents whom they 
had lost to earlier in the season. 

Kurokawa topped her Claremont 
counterpart handily , 6-1,6-3. 

" It was a great win for Miki because 
she had lost badly to the same girl [in the 
first meeting] ," LaPlante said. "It 's good 
for her confidence to come back and 
win." 

Hoecker, who had been defeated in 
three long sets versus Claremont ear-
lier, turned the tables and outlasted her 
opponent, 5-7, 7-6, 7-6. 

With only two regular-season match-
ups remaining on its schedule, the UCSD 
women 's team is quickly approaching 
its ultimate challenge, the Division ill 
National Tournament - which is not 
foreign territory to a Triton squad com-
prised of five senjors and ajunior. 

Heidi Muzhik/ Gu8fdian 

Undaunted by the Santa Cruz rally, 
UCSD's number-one duo went to work. 
With the score of game six even at 15, 
Takemoto panked a backhand at the 
feet of the Santa Cruz server, who was 
unable to handle the return. Kurokawa 
matched her partner's success, driving a 

"We need to keep improving in 
doubles," Takemoto said. "Doubles is 
the key to winning the ma.ch, because 
winning three points right off takes the 
pressure off in singles." 

"All our team members are experi-
enced at nationals," Takemoto said. "We 
realize we still have a lot of work to do, 
but I know we ' ll play well."

Flood of Records Swamps Invite 
'FORTY-SOMETHING': That's how many personal and 
se~on records were broken by the Tritons at the UCSD Invite 
By Dn Kreft 
Sports Editor 

Saturday was one of those afternoons that 
will live on in Triton track and field lore for 
som~ time. In all , 40 UCSD athletes had either 

seasonal or personal bests . 
NCAA marks were be in g 
posted as frequently as tock 
updates on Wall Street. 

"We just opened the gates 
and let them run," UCSD Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdale said. 
"To have those kind of perfor-
mances in the midst of hosting 

the invite just shows the kind of athletes 
UCSO has to offer." 

The field at the UCSD Invitational was 
broken into open and invitational races, with 
the invites hou ing the race favorites. Despite 
competing ag:>inst stiff competition in the 
invites, the Tritons were able to boast of three 
invite event winners come day 's end . In the 
men's 3000-meter steeplechase, UCSO 's 
Rhodes Walton emerged victorious in only 
his second evertry at the event. Walton 's time 

of 9:20.20 wa also a personal record by an 
astounding 21 econd . 

"It was the best race I ever ran ," Walton 
said. "I had never won a race in college, and 
all my friends were there . It was great." 

Robyn Herskowitz posted the UCSO 
women's individual highlight of the day with 
her stretch run in the 800m invite. Her kowitz 
out- printed Mesa's Rowena Gonzales to the 
fini h to claim the win in a time of 2: 14.10, 
setting a school record in the process. Maggie 
Dwire was close on her teammates heels, 
taking third in2: 15.03. Thetimes ofboth were 
automatic qualifying times for the NCAAs 
and personal records (PRs). 

The final invite winner of the day for the 
Tritons was the women's 4 x 400m relay 
squad, which ran to a much improved time of 
3:57.15. The improvement, according to Van 
Arsdale, was sparked by lead-off runnerOdeUe 
Vela quez' best ever leg. 

"[V ela quez] was like the locomotive pow-
ering the train," Van Arsdale said. "And we 
had the most beautiful handoffs. It was like

The comeback kids - an appropriate name 
for the UCSD baseball team these days, espe-
cially after a pair of come-from-behind perfor-
mances last week. 

The Triton hardballers rallied to defeat 
Chapman University, 6-5, last Saturday at 
Triton Baseball Stadium, after dropping a one-
run contest two days earlier to Point Loma, 7-

6. In both instances, UCSD overcame large 
deficits to get baGk into the games. 

On Thursday, the Crusadersjumped out to 
an early 7-0 lead and seemed headed for an 
easy win. The Tritons made a game of it, 
however, scoring six runs in the seventh inning 
to trail the Crusaders by just one run. Unfortu-
nately, UCSD's offense was quelled in the 
eight and ninth innings, and Point Loma went
