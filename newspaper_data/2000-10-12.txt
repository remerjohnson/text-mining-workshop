Ribbon Cut for UCSD's New 
Undergraduate Library 
Dynes speaks at CLICS grand opening 

Contributing News Writer 

Hailed as the first University 
of California library of the 21 st 
century, the newly remodeled 
undergraduate library, CLlCS, 
held its ribbon-cutting ceremony 

. on Wednesday at Galbraith Hall 
near the Revelle Plaza. 

The new library, whose name 
is an acronym meaning "Center 
for Library and Instructional 
Computing Services: serves 
undergraduates with general and 
specific research materials. It is 
equipped with 172 computers to 
be used for Web browsing, e-
mail and word processing. 

Chancellor Robert Dynes was 
on hand to open the first new 
UCSD library in 15 years. 

"As UCSD enters an area of 
unprecedented growth" we will 

be able to teach students to 
access the world so they may be 
able to compete in the future in a 
winning way," Dynes said. 
"CLleS will be the facility that 
will put UCSD on the map as a 
national leader." 

The newly renovated 'Iibrary 
will serve to accommodate the 
numerous students UCSD 
expects in upcoming years. 

Senior Vice Chancellor 
Marsha Chandler spoke of the 
growth of Eleanor Roosevelt 
College, the creation of new 
dorms and the birth of Sixth 
College as factors in creating fur-
ther research centers.

vices manaser and employee of

UCSD welcomes Christine Kehoe to its 
local gay and lesbian Event 
By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Contributing News Writer 

The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender Association hosted a 
National Coming Out Day rally 
Wednesday in the Price Center 
Plaza, which included an open mic 
forum, music and the participation 
of community leaders. 

As lunchtime business began, 
the rally did as well, with a wel-
come from LGBTA principal 
member Erin Harrell. 

Harrell spoke of her experi-
ences and, as more gathered 
'Bround the steps of the plaza, she 
spoke of the significance of 
National Coming Out Day. 

"This is more gratifying: 
Harrell said, "as the days go on." 

Harrell then introduced San 
Diego City Councilwoman, activist 
and lawyer Christine Kehoe. 

An active member of the com-
munity anCl an openly gay political 
official, Kehoe spoke of how 
pleased she was to be at UCSD, 
and how acceptance is needed in 
order to make the world change. 
She cited the two-year anniversary 
of the death of Matthew Shepard, 
a young man murdered because of 
his sexual preference, as evidence 
that changes need to be made. 

"We have to live our lives open-
ly, and we have to be open about 
who we are and who we love," 
Kehoe said. "It is cool to be queer, 
and you are the ones who have got 
to make that change, if that is what 
you wish to see: 

Speakers advocated voting and 
told the audience that the only way 
to get what one wants is to vote. 

During his turn at the micro-

phone, UCSD student Mikey 
Kaufmann shared his past 
National Coming Out Day Rally 
experience. He drew correlations 
between the event and the campus 
community at large. 

"This event is not just an 
LGBT event," Kaufmann said, "it 
is for everyone." 

He said it was empowering for 
him to be on stage and to have 
everyone in the Price Center lis-
tening to his words. 

The rally, which took about 
three weeks to plan, included 
information tables positioned 
around the stage with fliers and 
brochures for distribution . 

Angela Barrett, residential 
office program coordinator for the 
LGBT Resource Center, was sta-
tioned at a table. She was pleased 
with the event. 

"This is a national event 
where we t,ry to have something 
on every UC and col~ege cam- ' 
pus," Barrett said , "but It is really 
about achieving awareness here 
at UCSD: 

Harrell agreed . 
"The awareness is the impor-

tant issue, and we do this to make 
the change here. You can't see it as 
much as it helps, but there are 
those who are silent and listening 
to [the rally] and it makes a differ-
ence to them." 

Every year the support grows 
from the community. 

Harrell considered the day suc-
cessful and used those at the 
microphone .and those gathered in 
the plaza as proof. 

"Here in Price Center, everyone 
is watching and listening: Harrell 
said.

Mexico to be connected to 
faster Internet 

A super-fast, high-performance network 
called CaIREN-2 now connects Mexico's scien-
tific and scholarly institutions to the University 
of California and other major research universi-

The connection is part of California's portion 
of Internet2 and links Mexico with more than 
180 universities, industries and government 
agencies at speeds 100 to 1,000 times faster than 
allowed by previous technologies. 

The new connection is the product of a 1997 
agreement of cooperation in higher education 
and research between the University of 
California and Mexico's equivalent of the 
National Science Foundation.

UCSD to host free HIV / AIDS 
community forum 

Current HIV and AIDS treatment, research, 
clinical trials and outreach programs offered by 
UCSO will be discussed at a free Hrv/AIDS 
Community Forum scheduled for Oct. 20. 

More than 384,000 Americans are living in 
all stages of HIY. Worldwide, there are 18,000 
new infections each day, and, in San Diego, an 
estimated 14,000 people are infected with the 
virus. 

UCSD researchers and health care providers 
note that despite tremendous medical advances 
in the treatment of the disease, challenges 
remain. Many patients have trouble adhering to 
the grueling lifelong therapy, while others devel-
op resistance to available treatments. 

UCSD's HIV/AIDS program is currently 
ranked in the nation's top 10 AlDS programs in 
the United States by U.S. News and World Report.

"We will be open 99 hours a

The library will operate from 10 
a.m. to 1 a.m. Sunday through

Friday and Saturday. The library 
will also be open until 3 a.m. dur-
ing finals week. 

Following the ribbon cutting, 
live music from San Diego swing 
band Big Time Operator enter-
tained those in attendance. 

CLiCS offers a 2,500-volume 
collection shaped to meet the 
needs of the coUegt writing pro-
grams, 50 journals and newspapers 
and a 2,OOO-volume current aware-
ness nonfiction and fiction collec-

c:.n-.: Cluma/Jor Robert C. £rynes and A.s. President Doc Khaltghi ad the ribbon 
at the grand opening c:eremotry fur CLlCS, the newly renovated undergradUiJlt library. 

CLiCS also sports the newest 
Peabody's coffee cart on campus. 

Galbraith Hall, home to CLICS, 
was constructed in 1965 and func-
tioned as the main University 
Library until the addition of Geisel 

Foundation Duane Roth. 
Dynes honored the couple for 

their "dedication and generosity 
with which they have strengthened 
UCSO's outreach programs and 
expanded opportunities for chil-
dren of low income families." 

The $13.1 million facility is 
located on the UCSD East campus, 
adjacent to Genessee Avenue. The 
campus opened on its projected 
date of Aug. 15, 2000, 17 months 
after ground breaking. The Preuss 
School sp~nt the 1999-2000 
school year at its temporary loca-
tion in Marshall college. 

The school, now at its perma-
nent location, is the only public 
charter school in the state: to be 
established on a university campus 
with private capital. 

Library in 1972. Since that time, 
the library had served as a quiet 
study lounge and branch under-
graduate library. The library was 
closed two years ago to make way 
for the $11 million renovation. 

The current enrollment 
includes 431 sixth through ninth-
graders, and will ultimately reach a 
capacity of 700 sixth through 12th 
graders by 2003. 

The school's mission, to expand 
the educational opportunities for 
low-income and educationally 
underserved students, is grounded 
in the principle that Preuss stu-
dents will be eligible candidates for 
the University of California and 
comparable institutions. 

Each student will represent the 
first in his or her family to graduate 
from a four-year university. 
Students who meet eligibility 
requirements submit an applica-
tion to the school, and qualified 
participants are chosen by lottery 
on the basis of space availability.

UCs Deeleve 
Students In Ironic Bid 
to Improve Image 

UC officials apparently feel that an accu-
rate report of any given campus' crime sta-
tistics regarding rape and physical assault 
would tarnish its appeal to prospective stu-
dents. It is not worth compromising the 
safety and awareness of the students already 
in the UC system to avoid deterring appli-
cants from a university that thousands of 
students already desire to attend. 

The article that ran in the Oct. 9 issue of 
the Guardian stated that after a five-month 
study, the Sacramento Bee found that not only 
were certain UC campuses misrepresenting 
sex crimes by only releasing statistics on the 
ones that were reported directly to the 
police, but some campuses also violate the 
Clery Act, which requires schools to publish 
accurate crime statistics. At UCSD, most 
sexual assault reports are disclosed mislead-
ingly because they are misclassified simply 
as "physical abuse." 

This rnisclassification may come as a 
result of college officials misreporting inci-
dents to the police. At the Guardian, we 
work hard to make certain that what stu-
dents read in their newspaper is accurate. 
We do not think it is unreasonable to 
request the same frpm police on our cam-
pus and on all UC campuses. 

The Guardian would like to know why 
there is a discrepancy between what campus 
security reports and what the campus police 
report. 

There is no need for shame if schools are 
honest about"\vhat happens on their cam-
pus~s. With full knowledge of campus crime 
statistics, a student is informed and able to 
properly protect himself if it is necessary. 
Changes can be proposed if there is, indeed, 
a crime problem. Nothing can be done 
when nothing is wrong. 

However, it is not appropriate to pretend 
that nothing is wrong just to avoid being 
"the Compton of the UC system," as one 
anonymous UC official told the Sacramento 
Bee. 

We applaud UCSD for providing securi-
ty escorts. They make us feel safe when we 
walk back to our dorms, apartments or cars.

'China Takes a Step in the Right 
Direction with WTO at its Side 

Allowing China to enter the World Trade Organization will playa major role in 
advancing China's role in the global arena 

By JOy HARDISON 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Visualize thousands of people crowd-
ing an expansive plaza, organizing into a 
single file line that flows through the 
entrance of an established stone struc-
ture. The people dissipate uniformly 
through an exit on the other side, mov-
ing smoothly and in waves, like the 
sounding of a somber bell. These human 
beings are participating in a 24- -year-
long funeral that takes place in 
Tiananmen Square every day between 
8:30 a.m. and 11 :30 a.m. 

During the remaining 21 hours of the 
day, Chairman Mao's cadaver is lowered 
into the basement of its very own mau-
soleum, where a team of China's finest 
doctors and scientists dedicate their. lives 
to preserving his body. Like Mao's body, 
communism in China has been decaying 
for more than two decades - and like 
the efforts to preserve Mao's rotting car-
cass, the Chinese people feel compelled 
to salvage the visual integrity of a politi-
cal philosophy that once was their only 
living and breathing hope. 

Communism is not just a system of 
government in China. It is a light in the 
distance. It is a dream that was never 
realized but still shines fervently over this 
Eastern nation. 

Despite the exceedingly slow deterio-
ration of communism in China, a new 
leader has recently been able to push 
against China's great leftist wall - and 
make it budge. 

Since Premier Zhu Rongji stepped 
into power, China has experienced a 
gradual turn toward capitalistic econom-
ic policies. Factories have been priva-
tized. Hong Kong, despite an intact capi-
talist economy, has been reincorporated 
into China. Premier Zhu is faced with 
steering the country into the 21st centu-
ry, and his strategy, according to many 
Chinese, seems to be to ·signal left and 
tum right." 

The premier must avoid conflict by 
entenaining the strong leftist opinions 
held by many citizens and officials, while 

Now China is up for 
acceptance into the World 
Trade Organization, and 
support from the United 
States wiU make or break the 
sequence of events leading 
China to Democracy. 

struggling to implement capitalist-like 
policies that have the potential to 
strengthen China's teeterin$ economy 
and build a better quality of bfe. 

Economist Damel H. Rosen outlines 
in an article titled ·China and the World 
ltade Organization: an Economic 
Balance Sheet" the positive effects that 
free trade will have on China's economic 
situation. These include the r.eversal of 
falling trends in exponation, the relief of 
debt pressure on the national budget, the 
potential for more government spending 
and the jump-start of a currently stag-
nant domestic consumption. 

However, just as the mention of com-
munism triggers blaring signs of caution 
to the trained attitude of our capitalist 
nation, coined terms such as "market 
economy" and "free trade" may cause 
Chinese citizens and officials to tremble 
in fear - 'regardless of how beneficial the 
result of these capitalist theories might 

. be. Participation in the World ltade 
Organization would help to strengthen a 
beneficial economic movement in China 
that might otherwise be thwarted by 
extremely leftist Chinese politicians. 

On top of th is struggle to find a sense 
of direction while balancing political tra-
dition with a need for change. China is 
emerging as a major power in the global 
community. With a territory spanning 
over 3.7 million square miles, a popula-
tion of more than 1 billion citizens. a 
gross domestic product exceeding $1 
trillion, and goods and services account-
ing for 4 .4 percent of wortd trade (all 
stated in the aforementi~ned article by 

Rosen), China cannot help but assume a 
pOsition of influence at the international 
level. 

Now China is up for acceptance into 
the wro, and support from the United 
States will make or break the sequence 
of events leading China to democracy. 
The U.S. Senate's vote to approve 
China's entry into the wro was a step 
in that sequence. Still, American advoca-
cy of China's participation in the inter-
national trade arena remains highly con-
troversial. 

Many people in the United States fear 
China's communist government is not 
ready for m~mbership in the wrO. This 
fear is certainly not rooted in purely eco-
nomic concerns. In April of 1999, the 
U.S. Trade Representative Office estimat-
ed China's entry into the wro would 
benefit the United States with a $3. t bil-
lion increase in exports thanks to the lib-
eration of trade barriers. 

The risk of U.S. markets suffering 
from the new competition of Chinese 
markets is also very low. Clinton pointed 
this out last January in a letter to 
Congress while petitioning for perma-
nent nonnal trade relations with China. 
He highlights that "no agreement on 
wro accession has ever contained 
stronger measures against unfair trade, 
notably a 'product-specitic' safeguard 
that allows us to take measures focused 
directly on China in case of an import 
surge that threatens a particular indus-
try." 

06viously, free trade with China 
would do anything but endanger the U.S. 
economy. The United States' true source 
of hesitation is that including China in 
the wro could undermine its efforts to 
promote a high standard of social justice, 
environmental protection and the 
preservation of natural human liberties. 

This places deep political and moral 
controversy before the leaders of our 
count!'y. Historically, the United States 
has chosen to reprimand nations ascrib-
ing to communist forms of government

Denny's a Treat Each Time 
Restaurant selVes good pie and inspires minds 

Stop 
That! 

BERTRAND FAN 

Denny's is green. It has a crooked 
rectangle of a logo and hardened 
waitresses. The logo is illuminated, 
so it's hip. It's like the '50s. 50 years 
too late. Some of the longest, deep-
est, most philosophical conversa-
tions I've ever had have taken place 

the incredibly hip sign, you can 
somehow mumble out the desire for 
Dutch apple pie a la mode. 

I remember a couple of months 
ago when I realized that I had been 
missing something imponant at 
Denny's. Now, I have been to 
Denny's well over a hunored times 
in my life, but you know when you 
see a movie for the 10th or 11 th 
time, you still catch something you 
didn't realize the first time you saw 
it? Like the look closer sticker in 
Kevin Spacey's office in "American 
Beauty"? 

at Denny's, and I 
am sure Denny's 
has seen much 
more than that. It's 
not illogical to 
assume that every 
major change in 
your life can occur 
at Denny's. Can you 
not see yourself 
breaking up with 
your girlfriend or 
boyfriend at 
Denny's? 

Some of the limgest, 
deepest, most 
philosophical 
conversations I've ever 
had have taken place 
at Denny's, and I am 
sure Denny's has seen 
much more than that. 

Well, I'm sitting 
there at Denny's, 
looking over the 
dessert menu, 
which I could 
already recite from 
memory, and I 
thought to myself, 
"They have Mr. 
Pibb. They have 
Coke' Floats. 
Couldn't they make 
a Mr. Pibb Float?" 

And so the puz-
"You know 

wh;lt, screw youl" 
"Screw youl" 
"SCREW YOUI Could I get the 

Oatmeal 'n' Fixins and a slice of 
Dutch apple pie a la mode?" 

Dutch apple pie a la mode; the 
piece de resistance of Denny's, avail-
able to ·appease your hunger 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. 
There is absolutely no reason you 
should not order it. The great thing 
about the slice of Dutch apple -pie a 
fa mode is that no matter what con-
dition you are in, be it drunk, stoned 
or having an epileptic seizure from 

zle was complete, 
and I had what alcoholics refer to 
as a moment of clarity. Is a Mr. Pibb 
float what you expect it to be? An 
orgasm and a half, like black tar 
heroin? You would have to try it 
yourself, but luckily, your local 
Denny'S is open right now. 

Which brings to mind the ques-
tion: What should I wear? Let me 
state now that Denny's, although 
reserving the right to refuse service 
to anyone, doesn't discriminate 
against race, color, creed or any of

Bloodbath in the Middle East 
Hinders Peace Process 
Recent violence bodes.illfor hope of healing conflict in Israel 
., ANDRIW BLACKMORE 
Contritiuting Opinion Writer 

The last two weeks in Israel 
have been marked by a bitter eth-
nic battle that may have all but 
dashed recent hopes for peace in 
the region. The so-called "AI 
Aqsa Intifada" has left at least 84 
dead and over 2,000 wounded as 
of Monday. . 

Immediate peace seems out of 
the question now, since the date 
given in Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak's ultimatum on 
Saturday demanding peace by the 
end of Yom Kippur, has come and 
gone with no further negotia-
tions. Now the threat of war is 
looming over the heads of Barak 
and Palestinian Authority 
President Yasser Arafat. both of 
whom stand to lose a great deal of 
political clout should war erupt. 

The battle in lsrael is a reli-
gious one that pits Jew against 
Muslim, regardless of nationality. 

[ronically, the battlegrounds 
for this war, namely the West 
Bank of the Jordan River and 
Eastern Jerusalem, are home to 
the holiest of holy places for both 
Jews and Muslims. 

On Friday, Arab youths hurled 
stones at Jews praying at the 
Western Wall, judaism's holiest 
site. Saturday, the tomb of the 
biblical patriarch Joseph was 
destroyed with axes and ham-
mers. and set ablaze by Israeli 
Arabs. In retaliation, Israeli Jews 
ransacked an Israeli Arab mosque 
in Tiberias late Saturday night. 

Eastern Jerusalem is also

home to "Haram ai-Sharif: or 
"Noble Sanctuary: the place 
where Muslims believe 
Mohammed ascended to heaven . 
The choice to attack such signif-
icant sites reflects each culture's 
blatant hatred for the other, and 
each new assault widens the gap 
that must be closed before peace 
can ever be secured. 

In addition, most of these 
domestic attacks have involved 
civilians, not soldiers. This week-
end, a 55-year-old motorist was 
killed by a rock hurled at his 
vehicle as he drove through the 
Arab village of Jisr al -Zarka . 
Similarly. a Jewish settler fatally 
shot a Palestinian. 

The list of occurrences such 
as these goes on and on simply 
because of the historical contlict 
compounded with the recent 
"Days of Rage." 

Monday morning in 
Nazareth, the birthplace of Jesus, 
Arab and Jewish youths pelted 
each other with stones, leaving 
two Arab youths dead before the 
demonstration was broken up 
with tear gas and rubber bullets. 

Perhaps even more ironic 
than the place of the protest is 
the day, Yom Kippur, the "Day of 
Atonement." It is the holiest of 
all days for Jews. t~e day when all 
disputes are to be resolved. In 
1973, also on Yom Kippur, the 
last war between Arabs and 
Israelis was declared. 

Although war has not official-
ly broken out. the last two weeks 
have seen a rising action that 
looks to be irreversible. Political 

factions on both sides have 
begun to dissolve and reform as 
allies against a common enemy. 

After the recent death of 12-
year-old Mohammed ai-Dura. 
both Arab and Jewish youth have 
become involved in the ' move- · 
ment, resolving to make martyrs 
of themselves for a cause they 
scarcely understand. 

On Monday morning, over 
5,000 Palestinian youths marched 
into Israeli territories in an effort 
to protest, but were halted by a 
gun battle at an Israeli checkpoint, 
leaving two youths wounded. 

When asked why she decided 
to attend the march, one 17-year-
old girl said, "I am here to speak 
for my country and give my voice." 

The clashes between Arabs 
and Jews date back to biblical 
times. and these values have been 
instilled in many generations of 
both cultures. 

The tragedy of the whole mat-
ter lies in the fact that instead of 
starting a movement to end the 
rivall)'. the students are placing 
themselves right in the middle of 
the battle and paying for it dearly 
with their lives. A shocking 40 
percent of the wounded and dead 
are between the ages of 12 and 18. 

The state of affairs in Isrdel is 
rapidly deteriorating as it strug-
gles against enemies from the 
outside and within . Over one-fifth 
of Israel 's population of five mil-
lion are Arab, creating a giant rift 
between the country's citizens. 

In .the weeks to come. peace

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Male Beauty Pageant Reveals the 
Ugly Side of Television Culture 
FOX unveils sexist and demeaning television show that 
harms men and women 
By KIM HOOPEIt 
Staff Writer 

FOX, the small-screen king of 
sleazy programs, did it again . 

It's as if once "Beverly Hills 
90210· went off the air, the net-
work searched desperately for a 
formula that would recapture its 
audience of simple-minde.d louts. 
Its answer came in the form of 
reality television and game shows 
with hokey premises. 

After presenting dolled-up, sad 
excuses for women prancing 
across a stage, hoping to tie. the 
knot with a millionaire, the net-
work rounded up stereotypical 
hunks to participate in its newest 
trashy TV endeavor, "The Sexiest 
Bachelor in America," a sort of 
Miss America contest for men 
over 21 from each of the 50 states 
and the District of Colombia. 

This fine piece of television 
aired Oct. 2. I saw the commer-
cials hyping it. I knew it was com-
ing, so I cannot say that I acciden-
tally missed it. Missing it was a 
deliberate choice. Still, I read 
about the basis of the show and I 
was perplexed and annoyed 
enough to write this article. 

Many women advocate such a 
show, saying that it represents vin-
dication for years of objectifica-

. tion of women in beauty 
pageants. 

The contestants in "The 
Sexiest Bachelor in America" 
competed in several categories 
that highlighted their beefcake 
status. 

tn accordance with FOX's 

desire to please the female audi-
ence, the men drew attention to 
their sexuality by answering ques-
tions about their romantic likes 
and dislikes, dancing with audi-
ence members and strutting 
across the stage in bathing suits, 
flashing their well-carved bodies. 

In this sense, they occupied a 
role usually delegated to women: 

Showcasing men in the 
same way that women 
have been showcased 
presents a distorted kind 
of equality. What is 
really happening is that 
both men and women are 
sinking to the same 
low .... 
the role of the sex object. Of 
course, plenty of men have been 
sex objects as well. The name Brad 
Pitt should ring some 
bells, here. But, having broadcast-
ed a contest that so explicitly dis-
plays men with the sole intention 
of objectification does not have 
much, if any, precedence. 

On the surface, it seems that 
degrading men would be a posi-
tive for the feminist cause. It 
would, in a sense, level the playing 
field . There is some kind of venge' 
ful pleasure gained in watching-
men try their hardest. to flash their 
plastic smiles and flex their abs 

after years of watching pseudo-
Barbie dolls suck in their stom-
achs and prance in high heels with 
Vaseline on their teeth to ensure a 
constant grin. 

However, showcasing men in 
the same way that women have 
been showcased presents a dis-
torted kind of equality. What is 
really happening is that both men 
and women are sinking to the 
same low level of superficial 
voyeurism, which is not good for 
either gender. 

That said, the playing field is 
not level anyway. Interestingly 
enough, Miss America gets a prize 
of$4O,OOO. The designated heart-
throb who walked away with the 
title Sexiest Bachelor in America 
got a whopping $100,000, which 
basically sends the all-too-famil-
iar message that men deserve 
more for doing the same "job: 

It's as if female objectification 
is accepted, even expected, 
whereas male objectification is 
somehow more special and extra-
ordinary, therefore worthy of 3' 
greater reward. 

The basic rules of the contests 
distort the entire goal of equality 
of the sexes. Whereas Miss 
America has the responsibility of 
being a positive role model for 
society, the Sexiest Bachelor in 
America is in no way expected to 
represent our society in a positive 
fashion. As is common, the bad 
boy image is rewarded, whereas 
Miss America is not supposed to 
have anything even resembling a

expanding its political sphere of 
influence. The United States takes 
pri~e in leading the way to social 
J~suce and promoting certain basic 
nghts for all people. Americans 
have looked down upon China for 
its fail ure to promote workers' 

. rights, its apathy toward preventing 
global contamination, and its his-
tory of ignoring international 
agreements. . 

These humanitarian, environ-
mental and security concerns were 
manifested recently through the 
angry protests in Seattle that hin-
dered the flow of WTO negotia-
tions last fall . The question that 
still confronts the United States is 
this: Do we collaborate with this 
increasingly influential nation to 
remove limitations on internation-
al trade even though we may not 
trust its political and social policies, 
or do we exclude China from the 
liberalization of international 
trade? 

Actively isolating China from a 
growing global community will 
definitely not spark the happy-go-
lucky humanitarian movement in 
the East that some may fantasize 
about. Consider that this opinion is 
coming from the mouth - rather, 
the laptop - of a person who has 
met the 17-year-old girls going

silk rug factories and who has felt

suppression that exists in this vast 
and disillusioned country. 
However, rejecting China's open 
effort to participate in the WTO 
will only aid the extreme leftist 
movement in halting China's pro-
gression toward humanitarian val-
ues, capitalism and, ultimately, 
democracy. 

Exposmg China to pressure 
from other more socially and erlVi-
ron mentally conscious nations in 
the WTO will actually aid the 
United States in facilitating a mul-
tilateral discussion with China 
concerning these key issues. 

'In addition, there is a greater 
humanitarian issue at stake - one 
that is not limited to domestic 
boundaries. Because of China's 
increasing authority, isolating this 
country' could critically endanger 
world peace. Excluding China from 
the wro means eliminating it 
from one of the greatest efforts in 
global collaboration the world has 
ever seen. [t means severing the 
lines of communication with a ris-
ing power at this critical juncture 
- a time when China is actually 
willing to integrate itself peacefully 
into the common effort to improve 
international trade relations. 

[n recent history, isolation of 
major international powers has 
only led to conflict. It is essential 
that the United States not treat 
China the way Germany was treat-
ed after World War I or the way 
Russia was dealt with in the years 
preceding the Cold War. The Earth 
cannot afford to suffer another 
showdown between major nations

today's technology, war equates to 
global suicide.

The exact hour that you want to 
go to Denny's is when they make 
their transition over to the late-night 
menu, or as some of my friends like 
to call it, the "take it up the ass" 
menu. Each item on it has been 
marked up a dollar or so for your 
convenience. Call it a stupid tax for 
deciding to eat late, or a "we know

without hesitation 
in the negative: 

One important point 
I must stress

is to avoid at all

start to think of the .

At that point, you'll 
be as numb to the 
prices as you are to

envelopes under-

especially if you are 
studying. 

The directions 
to Denny's are 
quite simple: head 
down La Jolla "No, thank you," as 

"Not really" presents him with one 
option too many. One good way to 
work it is to give all of your back-
packs to one person and have him 
wait outside until you get seated in 
the &ood section, and then bring in 
your'co·ntraband. . 

Why all the effort to avoid the 
studyin~ section? The studying 
section IS manned by one waiter or 
waitress who visits you about every 
two hours or so to inquire as to 
why you have not left yet. Getting 
service in the study section is much 
like playing the try-to-catch-a-

turns into Miramar Road . The 
problem is that usually, w.hen you're 
going to Denny's. a long, long time 
seems like a long, long, long, long 
time. Fifteen minutes seems like two 
hours, and sometimes it is when 
you're going five miles an hour and 
waiting at green lights. 

And for those who want to go 
the extra mile, literally, there is a 
restaurant named Keith's a little 
further past Denny's next to

scandal on her record. 

In a way, even if men are final-
ly being paraded like women 
always have in a contest like "The 
Sexiest Bachelor in America,· the 
objectification of women is just 
being further condoned. 

[ can see it now: men ratio-
nalizing the existence of even 
more risque displays of women 
"because, well, they had that one 
show where the guys- stripped 
down: 

Exploiting men is just a tricky 
concession to feminism and I'm 
surprised at how many women 

the most highly populated coun-
try in the world. Political relations 
between China and Taiwan will 
surely improve, allowing the 
Taiwanese people to engage in 
business ventures with the main-
land instead of worrying about a 
potential missile attack. 

As we forge together into the 
21 st century, communication with 
this Eastern power is imperative. 
China is ready for transition, and 
the direction of this transition 
depends on the leadership of the 
United States and other influen-
tial nations. 

It is important to remember 
that less than a century ago China 
was still under dynasty rule. [t has 
since endured world war, civil war 
and cultural revolution . Mere 
decades from a mystical time of 

are fooled . In truth, the exploita-
tion of men or women under-
mines the quest for respect for 
both genders Such ridiculous 
pageants have the inevitable 
effect of making all of humanity 
look downright stupid. 

So, not to be prude or con-
servative, but [ don't see why 
people need to be flaunting their 
bodies in a robotic fashion in 
order to salvage networks in the 
ratings game. 

It's not that I don't appreciate 
the male form (wink, wink), but 
mystery is more attractive than 
anything. There's something 
inherently cheap about men 
willingly submitting to being 
defined by their m ustle tone. •

one stage.

emperors and concubines, China 
finds itself flying a time machine 
at warp speed through a galaxy of 
political thought. The condensed 
political evolution that China has 
already withstood must be taken 
to the next level. 

Poverty and oppression are just 
as real as they were before the 
days of the beloved chairman . 
Still , visions of communist utopia 
still echo through space-time, and 
many Chinese are not ready to 
abort this "mission impossible: 
The United States and other 
nations must actively incorporate 
China into the higher standards 
for social and economic justice 
that accompany the new millenni-

process.

~D & -NATION 
Israeli Leader Warns of '.,rorist Threat 
as Violence Continues 

JERUSALEM - Despite an 
intensive international effort to 
defuse the tension here, the vio-
lence continued on Wednesday, 
and Prime Minister Ehud Barak 
warned Israelis that renewed ter-
rorism by [slamic militants could 
fo llow the riot ing and gun battles 
of the last 13 days. 

The fun eral procession on 
Wednesday of a slain American-
born Jewish settler, which was 
stoned by Palestinians, set off 
hours of gun battles between 
Palestinians and [sraeli soldiers in 
the vo[atile Nablus area on the 
West Bank. 

[n clashes elsewhere, three 
Palestinians were shot dead by 
[sraeli troops, bringing the num-
ber of dead to at least 93. 

While foreign diplomats here 
sought [sraeli-Palestlnian agrl:e-
ment on what kind of fact-finding 
body should examine the deadly 
conflict - a key to arranging a 
meeting between Barak and the 
Palestinian leader, Vasser Arafat -
President Clinton said on 
Wednesday that he or Secretary of 
State Made[eine Albright might 

A senior Israeli military 
intelligence officer said 
Islamic groups believed 
that they had been given 
"a blinking yellow light" 
to renew terrorism. 
visit the Middle East. 

But most Israeli and 
Palestinian officials do not 
expect a summit meeting con-
vened before the Arab world 
gathering in Cairo, Egypt, on 
Oct. 21-22. 

[n Cairo on Wednesday, 
Egyptian officials said President 
Hosni Mubarak had rejected 
Clinton's suggestion for a sum-
mit 'meeting by the end of this 
week. 

They said that an eventual 
meeting was not ruled out, but 
that Mubarak had explained in a 
letter to Clinton that Egypt could 
not take part until [srael accepted 
an international inquiry and with-
drew its troops from Palestinian 
territories. 

After the release of about 20 
members of Islamic fundamental-
ist groups from Palestinian pris-
ons, Barak said on Wednesday 
that he had instructed security 
and intelligence officials to pre-
pare for the possibility of terrorist 
attacks. 

"[ call on the public to be 
alert: he added. 

A senior [sraeli military intelli-
gence officer said Islamic groups 
believed that they had been given 
"a blinking yellow light" to renew 
terrorism. 

But Palestinian officials said 
Barak was overreacting to a prison 
release that was ordered by 
Palestinian judges because the 
men were being held without 
charges. 

They also asserted that the 
Israeli prime minister was trying 
'to shift the international percep-
tion of Israel from "military 
aggressor _ to terror victim: as 
Hanan Ashrawi, a senior 
Palestinian official, said.

u.s. Appeals Court Tells FCC to End 
Fairness Rules in Broadcasting 

WASHINGTON On 
Wednesday, a federal appeals 
court ordered the repeal of two 
long-established ruleS that had 
required radio and television sta-
tions to provide free reply time for 
opponents of political candidates 
endorsed by the stations and for 
candidates and others whose 
integrity had been attacked. 

The decision was a stinging 
rebuke of the Federal 
Communications Commission . 
The court concluded that the 
FCC had dawdled for decades in 
considering broadcasters' com-
plaints about the rules and had 
failed to respond to repeated court 
requests to justify chilling effects 
of the rules' on free speech. 

Broadcasters had long com-
plained that instead of promoting 
programming about political and 
rontroversial subjects, the rules 
discouraged such shows by 
imposing stringent reply require-
ments. 

The FCC did not say whether 
it would appeal the decision, 
which comes after more than 30 
years of legal wrangling about a 
series of regulations that had 
forced television and radio sta-

tions to provide freE replr time to 
people who had been critIcized on 
broadcasts. 

Hoping to avert an adverse 
court ruling, the FCC last week 
temporarily suspended the rules, 
the last vestiges of the fairness 
doctrine, to test during the politi-
cal season whether they were nec-
essary. 

The 60-day suspension had 
followed years of deadlock 
between the two Republican com-
missioners at the FCC who had 
wanted to repeal the rules, and 
two Democratic commissioners 
who supported the rules. 

That stalemate was broken last 
Wednesday after the FCC chair-
man, William E. Kennard, . a 
Democrat who had disqualified 
himself from participating in the 
case because earlier in his career 
he had helped prepare a legal brief 
on the issue as a lawyer for the 
broadcasters, reversed course and 
decided to participate. He then 
cast the decisive vote to suspend 
the regulations. 

On Wednesday, two judges of 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia said the 
FCC's suspension was inadequate, 

and took the highly unusual step 
of ordering the agency to repeal 
the rules immediately. 

The judges said the suspension 
order was not responsive to the 
court's earlier requests to justify the 
rules in light of the First 
Amendment infringement it 
imposes. Rather. the judges said, 
the suspension order ·compounds 
the problems" that had been iden-
tified by the nation's broadcasters, 
who brought the suit. 

Both the Supreme Coun and 
the FCC have long rejected the 
broadcasters' objections to the 
rules, which were first written in 
the 1920s at ·the dawn of radio, 
and codified by the agency in 
1967. 

A unanimous Supreme Coun 
held in 1969 that the rules at issue 
Wednesday and the broader fair-
ness doctrine did not violate the 
First Amendment. 

Most of the elements of the 
fairness doctrine were repealed by 
the FCC in 1987, but the political-
editorial and personal-attack rules 
survived.

Strike: 
Transit officials made 
their last offer on Tues. 
Continued from ..... 1 
old subway and bus strike that has 
left nearly half a million com-
muters scrambling to get to work 
as negotiations between the 
Metropolitan Transporta tio n 
Authority and striking drivers drag 
on. 

The 42,000 county workers on 
strike represent about half ~he 
county's total work force. But the 
worst potential effects of the strike 
were apparently avoided after a 
judge on Tuesday ordered about 
5,000 nurses and other medical 
workers deemed essential to emer-
gency services to report to their 
jobs. 

County and union officials said 
reports of compliance with the 
judicial order were mixed, however, 
and the emergency room and trau-
ma center at the giant Los Angeles 
County-University of Southern 
California Medical Center was 
closed, with patients arriving in 
ambulances diverted to other hos-
pitals. 

Negotiators for the striking 
union, Local 660 of the Service 
Employees International Union, 
and the county resumed talks at 
noon Wednesday, but reported Iit-

15.5 percent wage increase over 
three years for its employees, who 
earn an average annual salary of 
$29,000, while the county is offer-
ing a raise of 9 percent. 

County o ffi cials said they 
would return to court on 
Thursday see.king an inj unction 
orqering election workers in the 
registrar-recorder's office to 
return to work to prepare for the 
Nov. 7 general election . 

The deadline for new voters to 
register by mail, was Tuesday, and 
stacks of mail were piled up outside 
the registrar'S office in Norwalk on 
Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, transit officials 
made what they called their "last, 
best and final offer" to striking bus 
drivers and subway operators 
Tuesday night, and gave the union 
leadership until Thursday morning 
to accept it. 

If the offer is not accepted, the 
Transportation Authority said, it 
would send copies of the offer 
directly to 4,300 members' homes 
to persuade them to end the strike. 

Officials did not disclose the 
terms of the offerl and a spokesman 
for the United Transportation 
Union would say only that union 
negotiators were preparing a 
response.

Agency Plans to Study Whether Deals Delay Generic Drugs 
WASH[NGTON The 

Federal Trade Co mmission 
Wednesday announced plans to 
subpoena records from 90 phar-
maceutical companies to see 
whether drug industry stra tegies 
are keeping lower-cost generic 
drugs from patients or ha rm ing 
consumers. 

The commission has already 
fi led co mplaints against two 
brand companies and two generic 
companies all eging they made 
deals that effectively stopped or 
delayed the generic version of two 
brand-name d rugs. Several other 
such agreements are under inves-
tigation . 

"There are more of these agree-
ments than we know about: one 
commission official said, "so our 
desire is to get our arms around the 
scope of the issue." 

The economic stakes in the 
brand-generic drug wars are huge: 
In the next fi ve years drugs with 
$20 billion in annual sales in the 
United States will have corne off-
patent , according to Robert 
Pitafsky, the commission chair-
man. 

Without patent protection, drug 
manufacturers ca n lose significant 
profits. At the same time, the avail-
ability of generic competition can 
mean considerable savings for con-

"There are more of these 
agreements than we 
know about so our desire 
is to get our arms around 
the scope of the issue. "

sumers. 
Pitofsky said the study is meant 

to "ensure that the process of 
bringing new low-cost generic 
alternatives to the marketplace -

and into the hands of consumers 
- is not impeded in ways that are 
anti-competitive." , 

Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswo'man 
for the brand drug makers' trade 
group, the Pharmaceutical 
Research and Manufacturers of 
America, said any comment was 
premature, "but we are confident 
that any balanced study by the 
FTC will find the brand-name 
industry's practices are beneficial 
to patients." 

The trade commission's pro-
posed study must undergo a period 
of public comment and then be 
approved by White House budget 

official~. 

This will delay dny investigation 
until early next year. after the next 
president takes office. 

The Democratic candidate, 
Vice President AI Gore, is a critic 
of the pharmaceutical industry 
and has said brand-generic agree-
ments unfairly deny consumers 
the benefits of competition . 

His Republican opponent, 
Gov. George W. Bush ofTexas, has 
not addressed this specific issue, 
but the pharmaceutical industry 
has been generally supponive of 
his candidacy.

Coffee Carts Face Theft UCSD Student Wins Cash and 
Prizes on tThe Price is Right' Rash of burglaries prompts owner to act 

By PARISA BAMARIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

A sudden series of coffee cart · 
thefts has hit the on-campus coffee 
vendors, Peabody Coffee Inc., leav-
ing investigators with little to go on. 

UCSD police Detective Nate 
Floyd said that since mid-
September, Peabody's coffee carts 
have been burglarized nine times 
by unknown suspects. 

"The coffee carts have been hit 
from the courtyard of the Social 
Science Building to Center Hall; 
Floyd said. "Someone or a group of 
people have targeted the coffee 
carts in the evening hours when no 
one is around." 

Floyd said it is highly probable 
the same perpetrator has commii-
ted all the burglaries. 

The perpetrator has taken cash, 
some small items and has inflicted 
damage to the property, Floyd said. 

Floyd also said that there is little 
information to go on about who is 
responsible for the coffee cart bur-
glarizes at this point in the investi-
gation . 

"At ihis point, we have no solid 
leads; FLoyd said. "Anyone with 
information is encouraged to come 
forward ." Glenn Lyons, business 
development manager of Peabody's 
Coffee Inc. , said the company has 
taken many steps to prevent any 
further thefts. 

"We've taken many steps to 
eliminate the possibility of being 
burglarized again; Lyons said. 
"One example is that we've com-
pletely changed our cash manage-
ment and cash handling policies." 

Lyons said that because there 
are very few leads, the company has 
to take under consideration the 
possibility that the suspects could 

be former or present employees. 
"Though I personally don't 

believe it's an inside job by past or 
present workers," Lyons said, "we 
have to take everything into con-
sideration.;' 

While the thieves hit the carts 
numerous times, they had never 
been able to obtain cash. 

"It wasn't until the latter break-
ins, when two thefts occurred 
simultaneously on the same 
evening, that the thieves got cash," 
Lyons sa id. "Because up unti l that 
point, no cash was taken, only sup-
plies, and damage was inflicted." 

Lyons said that he is taking the 
thefts personally because he 
fou nded Northern Lights Coffee 
in 1996 on the UCSD campus, 
which later beca me Peabody's 
Coffee Inc. 

Lyons also said he is frustrated 
with the possibility that those 
responsible for the thefts will not 
be apprehended and brought to 
justice. 

"I am very frustrated that police 
don't know wh~ it is and have no 
leads, because this is bad behavior 
and the people responsible need to 
be held accountable." 

Lyons said employees of 
Peabody's Coffee love serving the 
UCSD community and want to be 
around for a long time. 

"We love being on campus. We 
love the students and staff - we 
love our customers and we want to 
make sure we are here for many 
years to come; Lyons said. "That's 
why 1 am putting up a $500 reward 
leading to the arrest and conviction 
of the person or people responsi-
ble." 

The UCSD police encourage 
anyone with informatioll to contact 
Floyd at (858) 534-4359. 

Soraya Chinea appeared victo~ious on the daytime game show on 
a recent trip to Los Angeles with members of her residence hall 
By MAn SCHRADER 
ASSOCiate News Editor 

The right price won Muir 
sophomore Soraya Chinea 
$25,000 in cash and prizes on 
Oct. 5 when she appeared victori-
ously on the game show "The 
Price is Right" in Los Angeles. 

"Everything is just a blur when 
you get up there," Chinea said. 
"There are so many people talk-
ing to you at ~nce." 

Regardless of her state at the 
time, Chinea still managed to win 
a new washer and dryer, dish-
washer, stove, carpet and a new 
piano. 

"As a seasoned veteran of 'The 
Price is Right', I know what it 
takes to win and Soraya came up 
big; said Muir sophomore 
Robert Buckley. 

Buckley, who appeared on 
"The Price is Right" last year as 
part of a residence hall trip, won a 
digital camera as a prize for being 
selected to go on the show. 

However, he was unable to 
advance to the next stage due to 
what he said was poor strategy 
and an uncertainty of the items he 
was bidding on. • 

"\ just choked up there; 
Buckley said. "I was positive the 
item I was bidding on was $69, 
but \ wasn't even close." 

Unlike Buckley, Chinea kept 
her composure on stage and won 
a barbecue on the fourth item she 
had a chance to bid on. Later, she 
won her first set of furniture after 
winning the game she played with 

host Bob Barker. 
Chinea said she was told to 

pick three out of four prizes that 
added up to $5,500. 

Despite the pressure of being 
on stage and almost losing her 
train of thought, Chinea said the 
game was not as difficult as she 
had expected. 

"There wasn't that much to it," 
she said. "But there are cameras 
and people yelling so it's tough to 
actually pay attention to what'S

going on. Plus you're standing 
next to Bob and he's quite the dis-
traction." 

Barker's presence, however, 
had no bearing on her spin at the 
wheel as her two rolls added up to 
exactly $1, thereby winning her 
an extra $1 ,000 in cash. 

She said she was inches away 
from roll ing $1 on her next spin 
which would' have been worth an 
extra $10,000. 

Chinea made the fi nal round 
and won the rest of her prizes by 
defeating her opponent in the 
showcase showdown. 

"Someone was screaming out 
$8,000 and someone was scream-
ing OUt $13,000; she said. "But I 

was thinking $11 ,000 which was 
in between." 

The showcase was worth 
approximately $15 ,000. 

Despite the excitement of 
winning the prizes, Chinea said 
she will not claim many of them 
as the value of the items would 
go on her tax report as extra 
income. 

"I hate taxes; she said. "For a 
$20,000 automobile, you would 
have to pay like $8,000 in taxes." 

Currently, she is uncertain of 
the prizes she is going to claim. 
However, the monetary value of 
the experience is for Chinea less 
than the qualitative memory that 
she now possesses. 

"It was really amazing," she 
said. "f never would have imag-
ined that one day I'd be up there." 

As part of a Muir Residential 
Life trip to see the show, Chinea 
drove to Los Angeles and met 
the producers while standing in 
line. 

She said she joked with them 
concerning her major and later 
was called onto the show. 

"We were so excited to ·meet 
Bob; said Muir sophomore Julia 
Ng. "He's a lot cuter in person. 
We were excited for Soraya too, of 
course." 

Chinea said meeting Barker 
was an added bonus for her as 
well. "He is a nice guy and defi-
nitely cuter in person," she said . 
"He wears a bit too much makeup 
though." 

The show is set to air on Nov. 
29 at 10 a.m. on CBS.

Dancing Delicious Movement and Poetic Performance 
Sushi Performance and Visual Art is San Diego's most vibrant performance venue 
By LINDSAY SWORSKI 
Hiatus Editor 

I've written about this place a few 
times before, but if you are new to 
the school. or are one of the numer-
ous people who rarely reads the 
Guardian, you may have missed my 
message. Go to Sushi Performance 
and Visual Art. Look at the bottom 
of this article to find the address and 
drive there immediately. Do not 
pass go, do not collect $200. 

What I mean to say is that Sushi 
Performance and Visual Art is one 
of th o: coolest places in San Diego, 
in the United States, maybe in the 
world. My enthusiasm may not be 
rational. but it is very heartfelt . . 

There are times when you go 
see a performance that makes you 
feel so much, makes you think 
about life, takes you out of your 
life, makes you laugh and scream 
and wake up. There are times when 
you go see a show and say to your-
self, "Wow .. . wow." 

Sushi is home to that type of 
show. Once I was so affected by a 
Sushi performance involving an 
intense poet and crazy drums that I 
forgot how to speak and had to go 
run around the block. I'm serious. 
A great performance is like heroin 
that makes you healthy. 

To clarify, Sushi Performance 
and Visual Art has nothing to do 
with food, except when it hosts 
potlucks or snacks before perfor-
mances. Sushi has everything to do 
with anything that is cutting-edge, 
anything that can loosely be titled 
performance art or dance, multi-
media or improvisational play. [t 
features the very best of interna-
tional and local artists in its small, 

intimate space with a beautiful sky-
light and hardwood floors. Many 
times the seats are so full you have 
to sit on the floor. This is <wel-
comed. 

Last weekend's performance 
started with a loosely structured 
improvisation by Lower Left, an 
amazing group of four women who 
are artists- in-residence at Sushi. 
The performance, titled "Available 

What I mean to say is 
that Sushi Performance 
and Visual Art is one oj 
the coolest places in San 
Diego, in the United 
States, maybe in the 
world. My enthusiasm 
may not be rational, but 
it is very heartfelt. 
Space," is an ongoing project in 
which Lower Left and guest artists 
utilize movement, text and whatev-
er else the performers can get their 
hands on in the moment. There is 
nothing like watching on-the-spot 
creativity on stage, especially when 
it is done so skillfully as to seem 
like the dancers practiced for 
weeks. And they're funny as hell, 
too. 

. After Lower Left's perform~nce, 
choreographer Wally Cardona per-
formed three of his works with 
dancer Kathryn Sanders. 

[ was bored after the first piece; 
so [ ended up leaving the building, 
waLking around a~d meeting some 

really cool people who were playing 
guitar and sleeping on the street. [ 
sang the blues and old '60s tunes 
with them for a while and only 
returned to Sushi in time to catch 
the end of Cardona's final piece. 
He's received a lot of great reviews, 
and a lot of people whom [ talked to 
really like his performances, so the 
night was a success for everyone, 
despite my journalistic flakiness. 

Plus, Sushi opened up an audi-' 
ence and artist discussion after the 
performance, so [ stuck around and 
got to learn a lot about Cardona's 
personal life, and his work behind 
the scenes and off the stage. They 
do this often after performances at 
Sushi and it is a great way to learn 
what process led up to the final 
product and get to know a more 
mundane and human side of the 
untouchable performers that you 
see on stage. [t is also very educa-
tional for anyone who is interested 
in doing herlhis own work and 
wants to know how the big people 
do it. 

So' Sushi is home to both class-
es and performances throughout 
the week. The members of Lower 
Left, who have been working for' 
years with ground breaking post-
modern movement, are offering . 
classes at Sushi for the coming 
months. This is a very special occa-
sion, and everyone interested in 
communicating through dance 
should come.

01( KId: Phil Selway, Ed O'Brian, 11mn yorte, Colin GI'I!tmJIOtId andJmny Greenwood decided wI to 
release arry singles for their new album N Kid A" in order 10 retain the rohtsiveness of the project. 

The-New 'Kid' In'Town 
After a three year hiatus, Radiohead 
release their much anticipated fourth album 
By JOSEPH LU 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Radiohead have always had lofty 
expectations thrown on their shoulders. 
After the self-loathing rock anthem 
"Creep,w Radiohead were dismissed by 
critics as a one-hit wonder. But Radio-
head were far from sinking awiy into 
obscurity. They countered with their sec-
ond album, "The Bends: and with a 
series of hit singles, -they were able to 
shatter the image of "that band tl\at plays 
'Creep.' " 

But Radiohead weren't finished . [n 
1997 9. rei -
to 
limits of musical creativity, even though 
critics were certain it was commercial sui-
cide. "OK Computer" went on to be hailed 
as t1ie best album of the year, and some 
magazines touted it as one! of the best 
albums of all time. 

So, if "OK Computer" was commer-
cial suicide, then Radiohead's most 
recent release, "Kid A: is a quest to 
alienate fans and then throw the band off 
into the deep end, only to attract more 
praise and more fans - a situation with 
which. Radiohead have always been 
uncomfortable. 

"OK Computer" propagated a feeling 
of detachment and the mechanical cold-
ness of a world run by faceless corpora~ 
tions. The music was beautifully produced 
and the songs were gorgeously penned. 
There were questions about how the band 
would follow up what many consider the 
best album of all time. 

Radiohead now follow with "Kid A: 
which pushes the boundaries of detach-
ment with cut-up lyrics, plaintive vocals 
and electronic soundscapes that swirl 
around your head until they make you 
shift uncomfortably in your seat. Radio-
head also refuse to release any singles 
from their fourth album, which almost 
forces you to take in the album as a 
whole. 

But here's the catch: Radiohead, who 
have been hailed as one of the best guitar 
bands in the world, virtually eliminate gui-
tars from their sound - yet they still 
sound undeniably "Radiohead." 

"Kid AW opens with "Everything in its 
Right Place: which sets the tone for the 
entire album with a keyboard riff that 
plops like raindrops into your ears. Then 
Thorn Yorke's unmistakable vocals tloat in 

up above the rest of the electronic noise. 
The soft thump of the bass drum is mere-
ly keeping time. 

"The National Anthem" brings about 
the first distinguishable guitar part with a 
fuzzy bass line. "Anthem" then descends 
into a cacophony of horns, which are 
mildly reminiscent of Miles Davis and 
John Coltrane. 

The album slowly melts into "How to 
Disappear Completely," which introduces 
a distinguishable guitar sound for the 
first time in the recording, as an acoustic 
guitar softly strums in the background. 
Yorke mournfully wails "[s this really 
happening?" as an orchestra soars behind 
him. The guitar is barely noticeable by 
then. Radiohead 's members, especially 
guitarist Jonny Greenwood, have stated in 
the past that they have become bored 
with guitars. 

But even as Radiohead reach a bit clos-
er to familiarity, they push you away even 
further with "Optimistic," which enters in 
the middle of the album with familiar-
sounding guitars and Yorke singing, "You 
try the best you can I The best you can is 
good enough." 

"[n Limbo" also follows a pattern of 
familiarity, but the song deteriorates into a 
wave of electronic noise and buzz. 

"Motion .Picture Soundtrack" closes 
the album with casc.ading strings with an 
angelic choir in the background that even 
Steven Speilberg could use in his next 
epic. 

The album is driven by keyboards and 
electronic blips and beeps that are not 
quite what everyone expected Radiohead 
to be. "IdiotequeW is the track that seems 
to be the furthest away from Radiohead 
we used to know. The entire track is 
deconstructed into a dark '80s style 
breakbeat with a claustrophobic keyboard 
riff. Yorke 's chilling vocals cry out, 
"Who's in the bunker? I Women and 
children first I I laugh until my head 
comes off." 

This isn't what JOu expected from 
Radiohead at all . "Ki A" is a far cry from 
the melodies and words of "OK Comput-
er." But loyal Radiohead fans know that 
Yorke and company were not about to 
release "OK Computer Part 2.w And as a 
result, "Kid A", is an art project accompa-
nied with music. Even though Radiohead 
have pushed forward with their music, 
"Kid AW still resounds with classic Radio-
head brilliance. •

Jill Scott: Soul Sister and R & B Queen 
Philadelphia native makes fans sing and dance as well as think at the Belly Up 
By CHAKO SUDIKI 
Contributing Hiatus Staff Writer 

"I know ya'il didn't come all the 
way out here to be quiet!" pro-
claimed Soul and R & B sensation 
Jill Scott, who exuded raw power 
and femininity at her show at the 
Belly Up Tavern on Oct. 8. 

Having recently released her 
highly anticipated album, ·Who is 
Jill Scott?" the singer delivered a 
very astounding and poignant 
debut and became one of the most 
sought-after artists of the year. 

Scott, a Philadelphia native, has 
collaborated with the likes of Mas 
Def and Erykah Badu an? was 
brought up under the wing of h ip-
hop group, The Roots. Her style is 
different from the fo rmulaic R & B 
that has come to ru le the airways 
- Scott integrates hip hop, jazz, 
spoken word and soul to create a 
style that is unique and full of fla-
vor and pure emotion. 

Upon her entrance onto the 
platform, it is obvious that Scott is 
a queen in her own right. She 
strutted onto the stage and began 
performing "Long Walk: which is 
a jazzy and upbeat piece about 
spending time with her significant 
other. 

Many of the songs like the 
steamy ballad, "He Loves Me." that 
she performed were pushed up in 
tempo from the recorded version 
on CD to keep the audience going. 

What really made the show 
more raw and amazing was her 
band and her back up singer. Her 
backup singer could sing passages 
of notes as if they were trickling 
water. She provided a nice contrast 
to Scott's bold voice and Ella 

Fitzgerald-like improvisations. 
The live instrumenta ls made the 

jazzy side of her music become 
prominent, and included a small 
horn section and a very enthusias-
tic bongo drummer. The 
unadorned beats of her songs help 
to accentuate the beauty of her 
voiee and the personal nature of 
her lyrics. 

It was remarkable to see the 
variety of fans singing and dancing 
to all of the songs. It was almost 
like a religious sermon or celebra-

Her voice is reminiscent 
of old jazz and soul 
legends like Ella 
Fitzgerald and Chaka 
Khan, yet she comes off 
with a Bohemian flair 
and a hip-hop attitude. 
tion with Scott as the preacher. 

Her latest album was claimed to 
be autobiographical and many fans 
understand the situations and . 
emotions that she is presenting to 
them. Her whole body fully gets 
into the expression of pain, jubila-
tion, lust and love thal her songs 
narrate. 

At the end of the song, "The 
Way," which vividly warns an ex-
girlfriend to stay away from her 
boyfriend, Scott mocks · sweating" 
his ex-girlfriend . By shouting 
expletives, narrowing her eyes, and 
waving her hands in the air, she lets 
the crowd get in.volved because 
they understand and sympath ize 

with her and get wrapped up in her 
energy. 

Her peppering of spoken-word 
poetry throughout her songs is 
reminiscen t of the beat poets and 
never overlooks those details in life 
that might often be forgotten . 

Each of the songs Scott per-
formed helped to exhibit different 
aspects of her character, making it a 
very intimate and powerful perfor-
mance. 

One of the best songs that she 
performed did not appear on her 
album. It was a song that she wrote 
after meeting a buxom but very 
immature 14-year-old girl. It is 
titled "Thickness" and was mostly 
spoken word. The song was a little 
shocking because it was very sexu-
ally graphic and angry but at the 
same time very heartbreaking and 
hopeful in the end. 

Her performance of "Watching 
Me" . also struck an angry chord 
about society and the idea of the 
government as Big Brother and 
society's obsession with voyeurism. 
Her lyrics and attitude received 
shouts from the audience and a ' 
raising of fists. 

The beauty of Jill Scott's art is 
that it is not overproduced. It is raw 
and pure. Her voice is reminiscent 
of old jazz and soul legends like 
Ella Fitzgerald and Chalta Khan, 
yet she comes off with a Bohemian 
flair and a hip-hop attitude. 

This was one show that was not 
to be missed.

life as the ·other scx," creative cami-
valesque aesthetics, and physical

Of all of the upcoming perfor-
mances just mentioned, one 
involves flying performers sus-
pended from the ceiling, two 
involve total nudity and all three 
will explore pertinent political and 
highly personal issues in very 
unique ways. 

So there are plenty of things to 
see, to do, to try. Just go there. The 
prices are vel)' reasonable, though 
they vary from performance to per-
formance; everywhere from $5 to 
$25 for special events. Sushi also

a left on J Street, and then a right

Review: I®®U U~® 
~ CID~®[ffiUS) 
This Hollywood comedy of errors is 
great for an awkward first date 
By PAULA auZMAN 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

The title itself gives me chills. I 
remember all too well the tense 
feeli ng that comes right when a 
boyfriend mentions that his par-
ents want to meet me. We all know 
the fee ling - that forced smile that 
appears on our faces as we roboti-
cally say, "I can't wait, honey." Oh 
yes .. . walking up to that front 
door, wondering what hell is in 
store for the evening, the first 
handshake and then the relief at 
the end of the affair, when our sig-
nificant other pronounces the 
evening a success. 

Too bad it didn't work out so 
well in this movie. 

. . "Meet the Parents" is a roman-
tic comedy about what can go 
wrong when meeting your future 
in-laws. And rest assured, plenty 

goes wrong. From one incident to 
another, Ben Stiller and Robert 
DeNiro keep you laughing and 
groaning with empathy throughout 
the entire film . As funny as some 
scenes were to watch , I found 
myself shaking my head a lot and 
thinking, "Poor guy'" 

There is a fine connection 
between DeNiro (tire future father~ 
in-law) and Stiller (the future hus-
band). Who better to play the role of 
the intimidating, former CIA agent 
father, who only wants the best for 
his daughter? 

DeNiro is a complete crack-up 
with his quick remarks and his so-
called tolerance for, in his opinion, 
the idiot boyfriend. His lack of 
exaggeration and security in his 
authority (like Steve Martin in 
"Father of the Bride") makes Stiller

ContInued frOlll ..... 17 

feel like a complete fool. The result: 
more laughs and awkwardly funny 
situations. 

Stiller is perfect for this charac-
ter, playing the role of the swej:t 
boyfriend who, even though he 
wants to be good to his compan-
ion, finds himself in some sort of 
conflict. As his confidence is 
repejltedly bashed, Stiller turns to 
sarcastic comments and nervous 
breakdowns that force giggles 
upon the audience. He plays the 
submissive counterpart to the 
domineering DeNiro beautifully. 
They are opposites in every way 
except they both want the best for 
the same woman. 

The story itself is hilarious. 
Stiller's obvious struggle is in seek-
ing the approval of his future parents 
while working against DeNiro's nat-
ural animosity toward the person he 
considers a poor candidate fo~ .his 
daughter'S hand. It was entertaining 
.to .watch one bad move, one wrong 
comment, snowball into a huge, 
horrible situation.

We All Live in a Human-Powered Submarine 
With a love for what they do and a lot of hard work, the UCSD Human Powered Submarine team is breaking records 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Staff Writer 

Do you want to know what 
real pressure is? Imagine prepar-
ing for a race against a team that 
tied a world record the day before 
- a race into which you have 
invested twO years of work. plan-
ning. testing, disappointment and 
frus tration, and all eyes are upon 
you . 

Of course. it is all psychological, 
but that pressure does not compare 
with the water pressure of a flood-
ed submarine 15 feet below the 
surface in which you are encapsu-
lated with barely any room to 
move. 

Welcome to Scott Ketcham's 
world. 

Ketcham is this year's president 
of the Human-Powered Submarine 
team at UCSD. A human-powered 
submarine consists of a one-per-
son crew in either a propeller- or 
nonpropeller-operated model. The 
most recent version of the subma-
rine is the non propeller style. It 
uses a computerized hydraulic sys-
tem to move the machine like a 
fish . 

The crew breathes using scuba 
gear because the entire ship is 
under water. 

"On Saturday we actually tied 
the world record, and that went out 
in the newspapers and all that. so 
everybody was really watching us; 
Ketcham said. "As the pilot. I was 
extremely nervous. We knew we 
could do it." 

"We kind of knew going in we 
could break the world record: 
Ketcham continued. "During tes)-
ing we had been able to surpass 
world-record speed, at least to our 

rough calculations - but when it 
comes to race time, you don't have 
any time to screw around; every-
thing's got to work JUSt perfectly." 

Well, there was no need to 
worry. as Ketcham and his team's 
submarine not only surpassed but 
obliterated the previous speed 
record for a one-man nonpropul-
sion submarine in Escondido on 
July 23. The team's speed of 3.467 
knots shattered the old record of 
2.9 knots. 

The submarine, dubbed 
SubSonic, was over three times 
faster than. Millersville University 
of Pennsylvania. the only other 
team in its category. 

"You can't do any better than 
walking away with a world record: 
Ketcham said. "The 

pride of building the fastest non: 
propulsion submarine ever devel-
oped and raced on earth - it feels 
really good," 

The achievement is even more 
remarkable considerin~ what hap-
pened in the team s previous 
attempt to race a non propulsion 
submarine. 

The 1999 model. Proteus, did 
not even receive an official ti(J1e as 
it was constrained by a serious bal-
last problem. 

"We had electrical problems,-

Thurs. Oct. 19 

ballast problems, drive train prob-
lems: Ketcham said. "All those 
took a ton of time to work out. We 
spent over three months in a pool 
testing every weekend - figuring 
out the problems. fIXing the prob-
lems and getting it working reli-
ably." 

It was the team's first year in thl: 
non propulsion category. and it was 
not easy. 

"To give us 
credit. we worked 
incredibly hard: 
Ketcham contin-
ued. "That year we 
had started totally 
from scratch. We had 
no submarine we 
were build-

ing from. It was too much work. To 
build a submarine that breaks a 
record in one year - it's just about 
impossible." 

While the Proteus was a disap-
pointment in the race. the experi-
ence the team gained was invalu-
able. They took what they learned 
from the loss to build a better. 
faster submarine 

"After last year's performance 
and having the frustration of not 
being able to do as well as I 
thought we should, [ was really 

gung-ho about trying to do a lot 
better," Ketcham said. "I really felt if 
we made the right decisions and 
stuck to the schedule and made 
some good moves, we could really 
do a good job." 

Smarting from the loss. the 
team eagerly looked forward to this 
season. a chance to redeem itself. 

"We had a couple members 
that knew what we wanted to do 
when the school year started: 
Ketcham said. "The first three or 
four months, we just talked about 
design . Every week we would 
have at least one meeting to dis~ 
cuss ideas and go over the advan-
tages and disadvantages of some-

thing." 
A lot of time went into prepar-

ing the submarine. 
·Over my whole Christmas 

break, ['d spend about eight hours 
a day working on a computer pro-
gram to simulate and model how 
the tail of the sub would work.· 
Ketcham said. "Even in class. if r 
got bored ['d work on the design or 
run some calculations." 

Once the design was set. the 
teain's members had to build the 
components themselves. 

A lot of money was needed in 

building the ship, and the funding 
does not always grow on trees. The 
team was funded by several spon-
sors, and members also spoke for 
or worked with companies in 
exchange for parts or services. 

Already having a body - the 
hull from Proteus - saved a lot of 
time. The minor detail left was 
three months of testing. The team 
rented out Canyonview Pool and 
worked at least once a weekend. 

"In general, we did really well 
because we' stuck to our sched-
ule," Ketcham said. "We knew that 
would be just super-important to 
stick to our schedule and keep 
moving forward, not falling 
behind, like putting back ballast 
testing. 

"The biggest setback we had 
was our control system," Ketcham 
said. "That really scared us. [t was 
a month before the race and we 
still did not have good control, 
and finally. we figured out the 
problem and got it working. But 
that really made us nervous." 

As good as the design was, it 
was still limited by funding limita-
tions. The submarine's materials 
alone COSt $35,000. 

Ketcham estimates the project is 
worth over $125,000, taking into 
account the extra labor cost the 
team members would have been 
paid by a company to work for on a 
project with the same quality as the 
SubSonic. 

The result of all these thou-
sands of dollars and countless 
hours of dedicated labor? Along 
with the man who has the longest 
toenails and the shortest woman 
ever. the team will have its very 
own place in the "Guinness Bodk 
of World Records."

things in a pool that require such 
skill it is unbelievable. 

Imagine being on land and hav-
ing to synchronize your move-
ments with gymnastic-like elastici-
ty. then take away the land and 
stick yourself in water. 

Now try to move in exact 
rhythm with your teammates and 
hold your breath for upward of a 
minute, all the while exerting your 
maximum athletic effort. 

That is definitely a sport. 
On the other hand. there is 

curling. Sorry boys and girls. it's 
not a sport. 

For those of you not in the 
know. curling in its basest fonn is 
rubbing a stick in front of a curling 
stone. the "ball: in order to help 
stop the stone where you want it. 

OK. so far so good. 
This is a sport. right? This 

takes athletic skill. Curlers com-
pete on ice and that takes bal-
ance.· . 

Rubbing the ice with a stick 
takes hand-eye coordination.

cia!ly for the Friday game." said 
freshman goaltender Jeremy 
Cookson. "It was a big game. and 
playing at home helped. 

The first half against 
Bakersfield. we played some of the 
best soccer we've played all season. 
And, though the second half didn't 
play out as well, we still got the 
result we needed. 

The offense has not been on it's 
own it producing goals. The 
defense has played a big role in cre-
ating opponunities. 

MOur defense has been doing 
an excellent job. and this weekend 
was no different: Cookson said. 
"On Sunday we could have played 
a lot better. but we still were able 
to get the win. and that's what 
matters." 

The weekend was a huge suc-
cess for UCSD. 

"All in all it was a good weekend 
and it puts us in great shape for the 
upcoming Grand Canyon game.' 
Cookson concluded. "It should be 
quite a match this Friday."

Grand Canyon was ranked third in 
the Western Region of Division II 
last year. going into the CCM

ment. 

The school. however, lost to 
CSU Dominguez Hills in the 
CCM Tournament finals. 

This year. Grand Canyon 
University has an overall record of 7-
3-2 and is 5-2-0 in conference play. 
The school is hoping to return to 
the title game. but has a number of 
barricades in the way of that quest. 

It will have to play in the 
unfriendly confines of lliton 
Soccer Stadium. where lliton fans 
will have the opportunity to get 
behind their hopefully playoff-
botIn4 team.

amount of rubbing needed 10 stop 
the stone takes strategy. These are 
all forms of athletic skill in one 
fonn or another. 

Still, all you are doing is rubbing 
a stick on ice. That is it. Finito. That 
is your sport. 

Now. I have no ·idea how to 
curl and [ would probably be hor-
rible at it if [ tried . Maybe I 
shouldn't knock it until I've tried 
it. but here's another idea: Why 
don't we make fire lighting a 
sport? 

It's the same idea right? [n 
essence. fire lighting is rubbing a 
stick on something to accomplish 
a goal. 

In this case, the goal would be 
lighting a fire, and in curling's 
case. stopping a rock where you 
want it. 

I think this is a brilliant idea. 
They could hold ' joint events: 
curling and fire lighting. 

They can form teams. The 
curlers play and then when they 
are done. their teammates. the fire 
lighters. go to work. 

Whichever team finishes first 
wins. 

Let's move on. 
Now that it is established that 

synchronized swimming is a sport 
and curling is not, why is walking a 
sport? 

Many a time have r wondered 
this as [ sat in front of my television 
watching walking races. Don't ask 

The UCSD Guardian 

me what r was doing watching this 
stuff in the first place. but [ have 
come to the conclusion that walk-
ing is not a sport. and that the only 
reason some ~ople consider it a 
sport is to vahdate there own lazi-
ness of going for walks instead of 

I think this is a brilliant 
idea, Thej could hold 
joint events: curling and 
fire lighting. They can 
form teams. The curlers 
play and then when. they 
are done, their teammates, 
the fire lighters, go to 
work. Whichever team 
finishes first wins, 
runs. 

In all seriousness this time -
not that I wasn't serious about 
curling and fire starting. that is a 
fine idea - calling walking a sport 
is equivalent to making dog pad-
dling a spon. 

Let's see who can dog paddle 
the fastest 4QO meters. Of course, 
there would have to be certain 
rules. as there are in walking. 

Yes. there are rules to walking. 
[n Sydney. three walkers were dis-
qualified for walking improperly. 

[ don't know all the rules, but 
one has to do with heel toe. heel 
toe. and there's another rule 
involving something about part of 
the foot always being on the 
ground. 

We could make rules about the 
dog paddle in the same way. 
Always make sure to keep th e 
head above water and continually 
hang your tongue out; things like 
that. 

Walking is just the poor man's 
running. Throw it out with the rest 
of the trash. 

Now. what about ballroom 
dancing? Here. the question is a 
little trickier as. dancing takes 
enormous athletic skill. But is it a 
sport? I am going to have to say 
no. 

Dancing should not be taken 
as a sport because - and [ am 
going to get a little bit deep here 
folks - it is an art form. Art forms 
are much different that athletic 
contests. Have you ever seen a 
dance performance or a ballet. or 
even a ballroom dancing event? 
Those are not sports. They are art 
forms . 

Those people are amazing. The 
lithe quickness with which they 
move makes them more athletic 
than most people I consider to be 
pros. 

Despite the athletic skill need-
ed to dance. ballroom or other-
wise, it does not have the same 

SPORTS 23 

sort of innate competition that 
spon has. [n my opinion. when 
competition is added to dancing it 
takes something away from what it 
truly is. 

This debate s:ould go on and 
on - spon or game. game or 
sport. Bungee jumping: Is it a real 
sport? Maybe. Jumping off a cliff 
or a bridge; yeah, that takes some 
skill and is as fun as all hell, but 
how much of a sport is it really? 
Isn't it more like the rush of a life-
time? 

The point is. the line is blurry 
between spon and game. Games 
take athletic skill. but so does 
spon. 

The only easy way I have for 
trying to decide what is a sport is 
this - and I issue this warning 
with my maxim: This is a rough 
guide. so do not take it verbatim. 
Take a look at what the athletes 
are doing. and ask yourself. 
"Could [ ever do that?" 

If the answer is a yes, you're 
probably not watching a sport. If 
the answer is no, it's probably a 
sport. 

So next time you see some-
body curling, playing bocce ball 
or walking really fast, ask yourself, 
"could [ do that?" 

Then do th'e same thing next 
time you see Kevin Garnett jump 
13 feet in the air or Barry Bonds 
hit one into McCovey cove. 

See what the answers are?

Some Athletic 
Events are 
Not Sports 

TAil MILLER 

W here did people ever get the idea that curling is a sport? 
What about walking, or syn-

chronized diving, or ballroom 
dancing, or even bungee jump-
ing? 

Then there is the ubiquitous 
question mark of sport: the 
unsport, synchronized swimming. 

Those little petite women; aren't 
they so neat swimming around 
with Vaseline smeared through 
their ~air and those oh-so-real 
smiles? And don't forget about 
those cute little buns; don't they 
look just like little china dolls all in 
a row? 

Well, despite the Vaseline and 
china doll appearance and the fact 
that the only people who watch 
synchronized swimming either 
have a screw loose, or, like me, have 
nothing to do, it is a sport. 

Sorry to disappoint all you guys 
out there. Those women (and one

Stanislaus No 
Match for 
Tritons 
The women's soccer 
team not even 
challenged in match 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team continues to roll with yet 
another victory. 

On Sunday, the Tritons downed 
California State University 
Stanislaus by a score of 2-0 to 
improve their record to 9-2 overall 
and 8-2 in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play. 

UCSD witnessed some fine play-
ing from rookie Nicolette Richards. 
Richards scored her first goal of the 
season when she came off the bench 
and found the net in the 37th 
minute, firing off a shot that split the 
outstretched hands of Stanislaus' 
goal keeper Jennifer Rose. Kristin 
Jones picked up the assist. 

In the 48th minute, the Tritons' 
Julia Cuder added to the score, cap-
italizing on a penalty kick. 

Stanislaus never threatened and 
UCSD held on for the win. 

Rose was pummeled with shots 
throughout the game, and had to 
make nine saves. Her counterpart 
on the Tritons, Kami Poma, had a 
laid back contest, never having to 
make a single save. 

Next up for UCSD are two big 
matches at home this weekend. On 
Friday, Grand Canyon Univer.;ity 
comes to town for a match at 7 
p.m. as California Baptist 
University seeks punishment in a 
nonconference game on Saturqay 
at 7 p.m.

PORTS 
Two More Under Their Belt 
Men's soccer smashes a pair of conference foes in weekend action 
By ARVIND VUAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
had another strong showing this 

.weekend against two California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
rivals. 

On Friday, California State 
University Bakersfield came into 
town looking to improve upon it's 
4-5-2 record. 

Both teams had strong perfor-
mances in their previous matches. 
UCSD played exceptionally well 
on the road against Chico State, 
winning 3-1. 

In its previous match, CSU 
Bakersfield blew out CSU San 
Bernardino 5-1. 

"These next few games in the 
division will show us whether the 
playoffs are a possibility or not: 
said head coach Derek 
Armstrong. 

The Tritons' next task was the 
Roadrunners from Bakersfield, 
but this match would not be easy. 
Because Bakersfield's momentum 
was heading in the right direc-
tion, it would take a strong per-
formance from the Tritons to 
combat this surge. 

The game was a thriller, and 
it came down to overtime to 
decide the outcome. 

UCSD star Brady Bernard 
scored a goal with time running 
out at 90:41 that took the game 
into extra periods. Bakersfield had 
goals from Kyle Gookins and 
Andrew Coombs, the team's 
strongest players. 

In the end, the Tritons came 
up with the winning goal during 
overtime to get the well-
deserved win. 

After Bakersfield came CSU 
Stanislaus. 

On Sunday, the Tritons were

just too strong and too skilled 
for any team to beat them. 

UCSD defeated Stanislaus 4-
o to improve its record to 9-2-1. 
The MVP was Bobby Saadati, 
who scored two goals for the 
Tritons. Junior Roberto Guido 
added a goal and an assist to 
help the Tritons defeat their 
divisional opponent. 

This victory improves the 
Tritons' league record to 7-2-1,

Triton Tennis Teams Tango at Rolex Tournament 
Pre-season war!TI-up is a precursor of what may come when the official season starts 
By JESSICA UUSKAMP 
Contributing Sports Writer 

Four straight days of tennis that 
included the UCSD men's and 
women's tennis matches at Cal 
Poly Pomona made for a generous 
serving of strong playas the Thtons 
faced Western Region Division II 
opponents in the annual Rolex 
Intercollegiate Tournament. 

The Tritons used this tourna-
ment as a measuring stick for what 
they will face when the regular sea-
son begins in January. In unofficial 
ranking, both teams managed to 
finish on the upper end of a list of 
very strong teams such as UC 
Davis, Brigham Young University 
Hawaii, Hawaii Pacific University, 
Sonoma State University, Western 
New Mexico University, California 
State University Los Angeles, and 
Cal Poly Pomona. 

The champions of the tourna-
ment will go on to the NCAA 
Division II Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association National Tournament 

in Memphis, Tenn. 
For the t~ ird year in a row, 

BYU Hawaii's Petra Gaspar placed 
first among women overall . 
Gaspar, along with teammate 
Tagilfano So'onalole beat UC 
Davis for the top doubles prize. 

Hawaii Pacific's Matey 
Pampolov defeated teammate Jan 
lfibler 6-2, 6-2 to win the men's 
singles title. In men's doubles, 
Bratek and Tribler of Hawaii 
Pacific upset Markarevitch and 
Merc of BYU Hawaii for the title. 

"We played strong, straightfor-
ward tennis and the va luable thing 
is you learn what you can handle 
under pressure: said men's head 
coach Eric Steidlemayer. ·Our 
goals are always set high, and we 
aren 't that far off." 

The play picked up Thursday 
with UCSD demonstrating its skills 
by strong play with Dan Albrecht, 
Cory Moderhak and Amir Nejad. 
Moderhak defeated Claudio Hoyos 
of Cal Poly 7-6, (9-7), 6-4. The 
match went quickJy, but according 

to Steidlemayer, Moderhak played 
well. 

Nejad swung his way out of a 
difficult match up, defeating Cassio 
Giometti of Cal Poly 6-2, 6-2. 
lfiton Mike Lidsky defeated 
David Nguyen by default. 

For the doubles, Wilson 
Hayden and Sean Higginbotham 
defeated a team from Western 
New Mexico but were shut down 
in the second by a UC Davis duo. 
Cory Maderhak and Jeff Wilson 
pulled off a victory against 
Sanoma State's top team. 

"We are a young team, and I 
am pleased with our guys' efforts," 
Steidlemayer said. "We finished 
founh unofficially and that is 
about what we expected going into 
a tournament that had -'strong 
teams such as these." 

The four who represented the 
doubles women's team, Lyndscy 
Tadlock, Kirsten O lsen, Ashley 
O'Neil and Dara Walsh, all played 
tight matches. In several cases they 
had nationally ranked tennis pIay-

ers staring back at them from the 
opposite side of the net. 

In the early rounds, Tadlock 
upset, Sonoma State in a close 
three-set match. With a 3-6, 6-0, 6-
4 win, Tadlock was able to garner a 
place in the semifinals but was 
defeated. 

"Lyndsey played an excellent 
match against a player who had a 
similar game," said head coach Liz 
LaPlante. "She was tough and 
played smaner, and it was a diffi-
cult match up." 

UC Davis top players proved to 
be too strong for Olsen, as she 
succumbed in the second round 
of the competition. O'Neil had a 
similar experience against BYU 
Hawaii Tadlock and O lsen were 
not able to pull a victory out of the 
tournament, losing in the first 
round of play. 

' "It was a good tournament and 
the top three teams had very 
strong tennis," laPlante said. ·We 
had a feci for the teams going into 
the tournament:
