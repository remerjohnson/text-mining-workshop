The UC Police Department’s Annual Security Report for 2011 revealed there were 41 recorded instances of 
burglary on the UCSD campus and its 
affiliated areas in 2010.

“Theft of unsecured property, 
[including]  laptops, continues to be 
an issue.” Police Chief Orville King 
said in an email.

King emphasized the importance of 
using locks and keeping one’s property 
safe to prevent burglary.

The University has successfully 
reduced annual motor vehicle thefts 
on campus, which dropped from 54 
to 24 since 2008.

The report indicates one instance of 
murder on the UCSD campus on Oct. 
29, when the dead body of Carlsbad 
resident Lorena Gonzalez was found 
in a burning van in Lot 701. This is the 

first recorded murder on the UCSD 
campus in recent history.

In addition, there were 57 liquor 
law arrests in 2010 from 86 in 2009, 
and 16 drug arrests in 2010 from 40.

This is largely due to changes in 
policing outlook for major events 
such as the Sun God Festival.

“Enforcement of alcohol laws 
[arrests] were down, due largely to a 
change in tactics and philosophy at 
the Sun God Festival – with greater 
emphasis on keeping officers in the 
field to ensure public safety rather 
than focusing on arrests,” King said. 
“Enforcement actions were used more 

selectively during the festival in 2010 
as a tool, not a goal.”

According to Police Captain David 
Rose, the report statistics do not 
necessarily communicate the exact 
year-to-year changes in criminal 
activity at UCSD, in part due to 
differences in accounting for crimes 
from year to year. The report’s counts 
for liquor laws discipline rose from 
five to 1,050 and the counts for drug 
laws discipline from 17 to 94 over 
the past year due to the inclusion 
of new disciplinary data from the

Revelle College alumnus and chair 
of the Department of Genetics at the 
Scripps Research Institute Dr. Bruce 
Beutler, 53, is sharing the 2011 Nobel 
Prize in physiology or medicine for 

his recent discov-
eries of how the 
immune system 
innately works. 
Beutler is cur-
rently in the pro-
cess of leaving La 
Jolla to work at 
the University of 
Texas.

“I noticed that 
I had a new email message,” Beutler 
said in an interview with Nobel Media. 
“And, I squinted at it and I saw that 
the title line was ‘Nobel Prize,’ so I 
thought I should give close attention 
to that. And, I opened it and it was 
from Goran Hansson, and it said that 
I had won the Nobel Prize, and so I 
was thrilled.”

Beutler earned his share of the 
award for his contribution in the 
discovery of receptor proteins that 
recognize bacterial microorgan-
isms which then activate immunity.

The UCSD Police Department recently 
faced two incidents involving student pos-
session and misuse of replica guns on 
campus, both violations of the Student 
Conduct Code.

The first case was reported to have 
occurred at 2:10 a.m. on Sept. 17. Allegedly, 
the student pointed a replica toy firearm at 
a Residential Security Officer who was 
investigating an unrelated incident in a 
residence hall. The second case, which 
occurred at 1:07 a.m. on Sept. 20, involved 
three students walking around campus carrying 
replica toy guns. The students were later caught 
and the replica weapons were surrendered. 

Members of the UCSD PD have been trained 
to respond defensively and with deadly force if 
campus safety is threatened by a student’s posses-

sion of a firearm — regardless of its authenticity 
— according to a press release by Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Penny Rue on Sept. 27. 

“This extremely dangerous behavior threatens 
the health and safety of the UCSD community 
and is of the highest level of concern for the over-
all safety and well-being of our campus commu-

nity,” Rue said in a Sept. 27 campus-wide notice 
regarding the incidents. “In a post-Virginia Tech 
climate, the University has taken significant steps 
to ensure the safety of all its members.”

These cases of replica or toy gun use violate 
the UCSD Student Conduct Code, which enforc-
es that student possession of any kind of firearm, 

regardless of authenticity, is subject to sus-
pension or dismissal from the University. 
Students engaged in such misconduct either 
on- or off-campus may also face legal con-
sequences; Section 417.4 of the California 
Penal Code calls for criminal persecution in 
such situations.

Communication director Rex Graham 
and UCSD spokesperson Christine Clark 
could not comment due to the Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 
which restricts the release of information on 
violations to the UCSD Student Conduct 
Code and disciplinary actions from the 
university to students. Due to FERPA, the 

university is also unable to comment on open 
investigations, a category under which Graham 
confirms both incidents fall.

ScentÊCouldÊEnhanceÊTelevisionÊViewingÊ
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Kashi Khorasani
Staff Writer

The future of television 
entertainment may be upon us. In 
partnership with Samsung, a UCSD 
research team published an article in 
the international edition of Angewandte 
Chemie, a German scientific journal, 
proving that smell can realistically be 
added to visual entertainment systems 
such as television and cellular phones. 

Professor of Mechanical and 
Aerospace Engineering Sungho Jin’s 
research brings us one step closer to an 

odor-enhanced television experience. 
In April, Jin and his team completed 
a two-year research experiment on a 
system that can give off specific odors 
on command. Jin does not expect any 
difficulty programming this system to 
give off scents in synchronization with 
images on a television. 

Jin’s system utilizes a number of 
isolated elastic polymer-based 
chambers containing different liquids. 
These odorous solutions go through 
electrically induced heating and are 
subsequently released in gaseous form. 

Jin — a nanoengineering professor 

— has placed a great deal of scrutiny 
upon the materials and the methods 
used to shape them.

The chambers are made of a 
silicone elastomer, which is a rubber-
like polymer that offers a variety 
of benefits to the user. These perks 
include mechanical elasticity, proper 
circuit isolation between divergent 
components and resistance in extreme 
temperatures. The latter attribute is 
particularly advantageous considering 
the liquids must essentially be boiled in

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

A.S. Council had a wonderful 
bonding moment at the beginning 
of the meeting when A.S. Graphics 
Studio Senior Designer Alfredo 
Vilano gathered everyone around the 
table for the first 
A.S. family photo 
of the year.

While everyone 
could agree, I’m 
sure, that the 
moment was 
adorable, many 
of the council 
members were caught off-guard –

there had been heavy rain falling 
right before the meeting. Don’t worry, 
A.S. Council, the picture probably 
looks great, and all that hair ruffling 
truly made you guys shine.

Next, A.S. Council continued with 
everyone’s favorite A.S. segment, 
Council Member of the Week.

“Today, I will be bestowing the 
all-too-glittery sash to our AVP of 
Athletic Relations, Aurora Lopez,” 
Vice President of Student Life 
Meredith Madnick said.

Lopez received her award shortly 
after announcing that after next 
Friday’s Bear Garden, A.S. Council 
will be handing out free swim caps to 
students attending the Men’s Water 
Polo game. Let’s face it: All sports fans 
need an official swim cap.

Like all loving families, there was a 
lot of bickering last night, especially 
with regards to the new election 
bylaws. A.S. Council was faced with 
some philosophical questions: How 
do you define loitering? How do you 
separate Student Organizations and 
Slates? Is uniform wording necessary 
to uniform understanding with 
phrases like “may be,” “shall be,” or 
“could be?” So many hard decisions 
were made that night.

The pressure was just too much 
for a lot of council members. Many 

even had to excuse themselves during 
the discussion. Over an hour later, 
the new bylaws were set in stone and 
the Price Center Forum erupted in 
applause.

Then, keeping 
the excitement 
alive, A.S. 
President Alyssa 
Wing and A.S. 
Vice President of 
Finance Kevin 
Hoang gave an 
i n f o r m a t i o n a l 

budget presentation. Hoang described 
the A.S. budget as a big cloud of 
money, meaning that it’s all one 
budget instead of an allocated amount 
for each department.

“So it’s like a cloud, and we make 
it rain,” Wing said. “I just thought of 
that just now.”

Sophomores, juniors and seniors 
might be wondering when the details 
of Fall Fest will be released. Today, A.S. 
Associated Vice President of Concerts 
and Events Oliver Zhang announced 
that Fall Fest is going to be replaced by 
a new event called Hullabaloo.

“[A hullabaloo is] a loud noise or 
clamor,” Zhang explained. “I don’t 
know [why we chose it], it’s just cute.”

Unlike Fall Fest, which consists of 
three acts on one stage, Hullabaloo 
will have a main stage, student 
organization booths, food trucks and 
free carnival rides. So, it’s basically 
like a mini Sun God mixed with 
Bear Garden and the fair. Hullabaloo 
indeed.

“[Fall Fest] is an event that needed a 
new life,” Zheng said.

The teaser trailer for the event will 
be released this Friday.

The meeting closed shortly 
after a round of pats on the back 
for conducting a short, productive 
meeting. Congratulations, A.S. 
Council. We are all very proud of you.

of Strasbourg in France — the other 
half was awarded to Ralph Steinman 
of Rockefeller University in New York, 
who died on Sept. 30, three days before 
receiving the Nobel Prize on Oct. 3. 

Beutler is leaving the Scripps 
Research Institute to accept the position 
of professor and director of the Center 
for the Genetics of Host Defense at 
the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center. Beutler’s position at 
UT will begin in Nov. 2011.  

“I will certainly miss Scripps, but 
the opportunity at UT Southwestern 
is enormous,” Beutler said in the Oct. 
3 article “Scripps Geneticist Wins 
Nobel Prize” in The San Diego Union 
Tribune.” There are new challenges 
ahead that I just couldn’t turn down.”

Beutler graduated from UCSD 
at age 18 in 1976 and then attended 
University of Chicago for medical 
school. His father is Scripps Research 
hematologist Ernest Beutler, who spent 
time in La Jolla researching treatments 

for rare forms of cancer prior to dying 
in Oct. 2008 from lymphoma. 

Beutler and Hoffmann will travel 
to Stockholm on Dec. 10 to accept the 
prize from the Royal Swedish Academy 
of Sciences which includes a cash prize 
of about $1 million dollars — some of 
which will go to the Steinman’s estate.

Beutler could not be reached for 
comment.

Alumnus and Nobel Laureate Leaves Scripps for New Job in Texas

Burglary Rates Remain Stagnant while Liquor Law Arrests Drop

Student Conduct Office and UC Police 
Department officials. 

“These changes reflect a more 
effective, efficient and thorough way of 
reporting these violations,” King said.

King added that the sample size 
and crime statistics made it difficult to 
estimate long-term crime trends.

“Numbers of crimes in other 
categories [besides burglary] were 
relatively unchanged in 2011 from 
previous years,” King said. 

The report contains statistics 

describing counts of crimes at UCSD 
for 2008, 2009 and 2010 using 
information compiled from the UCSD 
Police Department, the Campus 
Security Authorities, the Student 
Conduct Office and other campus 
areas. The statistics are separated into 
15 categories, from less severe crimes 
such as liquor law arrests to the severe 
crimes such as homicide, and are 
organized by the location of the crime.

The reports only take into account 
crimes reported to the campus police 
and security authorities and do not 

take account for unreported crimes or 
those reported to other agencies.

The UCSD police department is 
legally required to release the annual 
report as part of the Jeanne Clery 
Disclosure of Campus Security Policy 
and Crime Statistics Act, a federal law 
passed in 1990. Reports of liquor law 
arrests dropped from 86 to 57 since 
2009 and drug law arrests dropped 
from 40 to 16 since 2009.

Scent Technology Developed With Financial Support from Samsung

order to be released as gasses.
The polymer-based material is 

produced via a cross-linked technique, 
which prevents solvents from entering 
or damaging the chambers.

Plotting the controller system 
design on a Cartesian coordinate 
system allows researchers to fit more 
switches on a smaller surface area. The 
efficiency of this method requires far 
less controllers than a system in which 
there is a single dedicated switch for 
each odor. In future research, Jin plans 
to explore a 3D matrix which would 
depend on less controllers, further 
minimizing the size of the device. 

“This is a very good way for 
companies to market their products 
during commercials,” Jin said.

Whether the masses have actually 
displayed a large demand for an 
olfactory-enriched entertainment 
experience, innovators have worked 
on similar projects for some time now. 

Osmologist Hans Luabe worked 
alongside a film crew in 1960 to create 
Smell-O-Vision, one of the first ever 
such systems. However, this creation 
could only release 30 scents and did 
not function properly. A few other 
attempts made since then have failed, 
until now. 

“It is quite doable,” said Jin.

The apparatus developed at UCSD, 
with financial support from Samsung 
Electronics, is considered to be 
a conceptual research model. After 
further research, all that is left to do is 
to create a realistic concept that can be 
attached to a television set.

Jin addressed how the collaboration 
between he and his fellow researchers 
made a big impact on smell-based 
technology.

“When you get together and share 
ideas, things just click,” Jin said.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MODNDAY, OCTOBER 06, 2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

At some point between zero and first week, I became disil-lusioned with the process 
behind campus free food. Don’t get 
me wrong — I was still subscribed to 
that free food Facebook group. But 
my tolerance for awkward pleasantries 
with strangers was weakening — as 
was my ability to stomach tepid pieces 
of Round Table pizza. 

After polling my coworker’s sug-
gestions, I was ready to spend money 
on the exact opposite of free food. 
More specifically, I was ready to drop 
twenty-something dollars on the glut-
tonous meat-orgy known as all-you-
can-eat Korean BBQ. 

There are no tricks in all you can 
eat Korean BBQ. Well, except some-
times, with the meat. Seriously, choose 
a decent restaurant. Our choice of 
Manna Korean BBQ in Convoy 
revealed no food secrets, thankfully. 

But between cooking and ordering 
and waving over a waitress for more, 
the strategy behind a Korean meat 
buffet is to eat your money’s worth. 

As an avid buffet-fearer, I did not 
feel ready to ingest $20 worth of meat 
and pickles. My friends obviously did 
not feel the same way. One had been 
fasting for a full day. Another had a 
bottomless pit for a stomach. And yet 
another was male.

Ten plates of meat later, it was 
obvious who had won the game of 
eating your money’s worth. I’ll give 
you a hint: it wasn’t me. I clutching 
my stomach in between delicate sips 
of barley tea, recoiling in horror as my 
friends contemplated ordering their 
11th plate of meat. 

As we bemoaned the state of our 
stomachs (#firstworldproblems), my 
friends and I reflected on lessons 
learned from that night:

First, red meat is the most expen-
sive thing on the menu — don’t go 
too heavy on the chicken. If you want 
your money’s worth, order expensive 
cuts like sirloin steak and pork belly.

Second, that being said, the includ-
ed side dishes are usually phenomenal. 
Try the egg custard, try the tofu stew, 
but remember to not fill up on rice. 

Third, don’t try to screw with the 
restaurant. They have clearly seen 
every trick in the book and their 
rules are clearly laid on their menu. 
Stocking your meat freezer at home 
by ordering extra take-home plates 
of meat will land you a fat surcharge. 
Everybody at your table has to order 
the same option — all meat or the 
pricier seafood version — in case the 
splurger with the shrimp shares.

Fourth, don’t wear clothes that are 
too restrictive. That’s pretty much a 
given for any buffet, and unless you 
want to make a show of loosening 
your belt one notch, stick to the elastic 
waistband. Jackets can also be used to 
hide burgeoning food babies. 

These lessons are secondary to 
the actual experience of all you can 
eat Korean BBQ. I may have spent an 
excessive amount of time there wor-
rying about actually eating $20 worth 
of food (I probably didn’t), but in the 
end, being there with good company, 
good food and endless amounts of 
meat and pickles was worth any price. 
Kind of.

Drafting Equality

A full 15 years after the state banned affirmative action with Proposition 209, Gov. 
Jerry Brown has the chance to over-
turn the controversial statute with 
a new bill. The bill’s proponents are 
careful to emphasize that Senate Bill 
185 will not completely overturn 
Proposition 209 — the wording 
of the bill allows the University of 
California and California State uni-
versities to merely “receive” data on 
an applicant’s racial background as 
long as no preference is given. But, as 
the UC Berkeley College Republicans 
were quick to point out in their con-
troversial bake sale protest, it is hog-
wash. Universities, once they receive 

this information, will likely use it 
to strengthen the ethnic diversity 
of their incoming freshmen classes. 
Whether using race in admissions 
is a good move or not is still up for 
debate.

In the debate on equal oppor-
tunity, our Editorial Board falls on 
the side of equal opportunity. We 
believe that leveling the playing field 
for disadvantaged students is crucial 
to extending a shot at higher educa-
tion for greater numbers of students. 
But this is not to say that our board 
unequivocally backs SB 185. While 
the bill has its merits — the bill’s 

See SENATE BILL, page 5

I t’s not difficult for a student with a humanities or social science degree to understand the real question that’s being asked: “can I get a stable job with a degree in history or ethnic studies?” 
Coming out of an elite public university like UCSD, I would say: 

yes. I got a humanities degree, and now I have a job. 
But that question (and my answer) doesn’t have much to do 

with the greater value of the humanities and social sciences, as I see 
it. 

First of all, you should know that from the beginning, the 
“specialization” of the humanities as a source of knowledge wasn’t 
intended to create a specialized profession in the Matrix. 

It was designed to help people figure out ways to break out of 
the Matrix: to go about bringing its destruction, or allowing it to 
work in the service of the Human Project — a project to cease-
lessly re-imagine what it means to be human, and to figure out 
what we have to do in order to make self-determining cultures and 
communities possible in a world of mass destruction, genocide, 
overproduction, profit-for-profit’s-sake, religious fundamentalism, 
environmental catastrophe, and all the psychological, political and 
social cancers that arise from these. 

Some people get to that project through the sociological study 
on the use of cell phones for education in India; some get to it 
through the set design of a play by Wole Soyinka. 

So, although my students in the social sciences and humani-
ties end up entering all kinds of professions — from medicine and 
law to web content management, from journalism and advocacy to 
business entrepreneur or community service, from public health 
to education, and of course, the creative arts — my ultimate goal is 
not to “teach to the profession” but to give students the intelligence 
and courage to discover their vocation on their own terms. 

Have the courage to use your own reason. See something of 
yourself in others, and others in you. 

Think globally, act locally. 
You need certain skills to do these: critical thinking, historical 

method, foreign language competency, reading analysis, commu-
nication, the power of rhetorical and artistic self-expression, and 
intellectual empathy. 

That’s pretty much what we teach. The rest is up to you. 
— John D. Blanco

Professor of Literature

UC President Mark Yudof ’s question last year, “Our businesses are doing well, but who is going to pay the salary of the English depart-ment?”, created a dustup across the 10 UC campuses.  His backped-
aling about the product of a liberal arts education and the obvious impor-
tance of the humanities and social sciences only raised more doubt about the 
extent to which a UC education was about to be high-cost vocational training 
and the UC system a series of private corporations.

Moreover, students and their families, faced with rising fees and the inevi-
tability of post-graduation debt, logically asked themselves about the value 
of pursuing a major that could not return a decent income. This is a logical 
response to bleak economic forecasts. 

But it should not be forgotten that those disciplines and majors that do 
not “generate revenue” in terms of federal and private funding generate 
something of equal importance: the ability to understand how societies and 
cultures came to be, how they work and how they can be transformed.

The hanging of a noose in Geisel library during Winter 2010 produced a 
number of reactions.  Those students who understood the historical signifi-
cance of the noose were understandably outraged. Because they lacked suf-
ficient knowledge in the history of race relations in the United States, other 
students were clueless.  “Why are the African American students overacting?” 
they asked.  “Just get over it,” they advised.

This latter group of students was in dire need of humanities and social 
science courses.  Our historical past is never really completely past.  Its rem-
nants reappear in our present and will resurface in our collective future.

Former UCSD professor of philosophy Herbert Marcuse once wrote: “For 
if ‘education’ is more than training and preparing for the existing society, it 
means not only enabling students to know and understand the facts which 
make up reality but also to know and understand the factors that establish 
the facts so that they can change the existing inhuman reality.”

Today, there is a real danger that students enter higher education as train-
ees for predetermined majors and careers.  They are fitted with disciplinary 
blinders and become indifferent to the pressing issues of the day and the his-
torical legacies that created them.

But many young people sense strongly that many aspects of existing real-
ity are unjust.  They feel the need for spaces where they can learn to under-
stand those injustices, debate their causes with their peers and chart a course 
to a more equitable future.  This is precisely why the humanities and social 
sciences continue to matter.

THE MENTAL FISHBOWL By Alex Nguyen 
THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 06, 2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

Dear Editor,
The San Diego Union-Tribune  

now requires commenters to 
identify themselves through their 
Facebook accounts, with their real 
names displayed alongside their 
comments.

Will you require readers to 
identify themselves before printing 
letters-to-the-editor in the print 
edition?

Will the people in your advisory 
committee like Bill Walton be iden-
tified with photos?

(When I see him next, I’ll 
ask Bill if he has shares in 
Facebook). 

Why don’t the seven com-
ments after the article notifying 
your online readership of this poli-
cy decision have photos? 

Why are they all 100 percent 
in favor? Can we be sure that they 
don’t work for the U-T?

Why don’t the seven com-
ments after the article about the 
embezzlement of Sen. Feinstein’s 
campaign funds — all of which are 
toxic — have photos? 

What do you do with the pho-
tos?  What meaning can they pos-
sibly have for you?

Dear Editor,
We are currently facing devastat-

ing environmental crises, and these 
are due to: (1) human overpopula-
tion and (2) over-consumption with 
consequent waste. 

In October, our population will 
reach 7 billion and it continues to 
grow at a rate of 3.2 people (births 

over deaths) per second,140 people/
min, 200,000/day, 80 million/year.

Worldwide, an estimated 850 
million people suffer from malnu-
trition or are starving; the world 
food surplus would last only two 
months if we share the resources 
equally, the lowest in decades. 
50,000 people die from starvation 
every day; 16 million per year. 

Thus, 12 percent of the world 
population is lacking the nutrition 
it needs. 

Yet we Americans (and others) 
suffer from obesity and overeating; 
we use a million plastic bottles/min, 
a million plastic bags/min, 100,000 
aluminum cans/min and retire 
(lose, break or throw away) 500,000 
cell phones/day. 

In San Diego, we generate 1.4 
million tons of waste per year. 

The 6,400,000 car accidents/year 
in the U.S. kill 45,000 people, injure 
3 million and cost $230 billion. 
Californians use 100 billion gallons 
of gas/year; SUVs and pick-ups are 
two times more likely to kill another 
driver, four times more likely to roll 
over and 20 percent more likely to 
kill a kid. Auto crashes are the lead-
ing cause of death for the age group 
6-27 years. 

Almost all bike fatalities result 
from car accidents.  

Do we really need to consume 
and waste like this?

 —Milton Saier
Professor of Molecular Biology

Dealing with a Bipolar 
Environmental Crisis

Looking Beyond Race Increases Opportunities 
writers recognized that after Prop. 209 passed, admis-
sions for black and Latino students dipped — its 
exclusive focus on race, ethnicity and gender ignore 
an equally important category: socioeconomic back-
ground.

The effects of Proposition 209 have been mixed. 
Consequential changes in the racial makeup on 
University of California campuses have varied — 
while the Asian population has dramatically risen, the 
black and Latino populations have dropped. Fierce 
opponents of the bill have denounced the systemwide 
admission process of judging each student by the 
same admission bar, no matter the economic back-
ground, because it allegedly perpetuates a racially 
tiered society. 

We agree. Different backgrounds shape oppor-
tunities. Socioeconomic background is especially 
important — more importantly, it is not necessarily 
dependent on race. Considered alone, the economic 

background of a student can adversely affect their 
SAT scores, according to “Colleges urged to use 
socioeconomic affirmative action,” a June 16 article 
in USA Today. The gap can be as great as 784 SAT 
points between the wealthiest and the most disadvan-
taged students. Colleges can offer all the financial aid 
they want, but until they actively admit lower-income 
students on a broader admissions matrix, socially and 
economically disadvantaged students will continue to 
be concentrated in the least-selective schools. 

Undoubtedly, Senate Bill 185 is a contentious 
issue, if the Sept. 27 Berkeley College Republican bake 
sale is any indication. Still, no matter what the main 
defining factor in college admissions ends up being, 
equal opportunity must be provided to level the play-
ing field for disadvantaged students. The bill’s author 
ought to reconsider the bill’s focus to center around a 
student’s economic background — not just their race, 
ethnicity or gender. 

▶ SENATE BILL, fromÊpageÊ4



�,
ancing across family values and the impor-
tance of dreams, Matthew Lopez’s semi-
autobiographical “Somewhere” follows the 
Candelarias, a showbiz-obsessed Puerto Rican-

American family living in 1960 New York City. As the 
Candelarias grow restless with fantasies of stardom, the 
looming threat of eviction and their apartment’s demoli-
tion hangs (literally) overhead.

At the helm of the quixotic chaos is headstrong matri-
arch Inez Candelaria (Tony Award-winner Priscilla Lopez) 
who, despite her insistence on tap lessons, her impromptu 
dining room dance numbers and a slew of creative Spanish 

obscenities, cannot seem to convert her stubbornly 
pragmatic, yet most artistically gifted, middle-son 
Alejandro (Jon Rua). But the family’s luck begins to 
turn as youngest Rebecca (Benita Robledo) lands a 
role in the film version of “West Side Story” (which, 
incidentally, is being filmed outside the Candelaria 
home) and Alejandro begins secretly writing a screen-
play chronicling the outlandish stories of his mysteri-
ous and absent father.

But the plot borders on the saccharine, combin-
ing family sentimentalism with Broadway dreams 
like a cross between “7th Heaven” and “Fame.” When 

Alejandro inevitably learns 
to embrace his suppressed 
talents, it’s like a scene from a 
long-forgotten sitcom. 

Not that the emotion isn’t 
well executed.

Beautifully incorporating 
the arena-style architecture 
of the Old Globe’s Sheryl 
and Harvey White Theatre, 
designer Campbell Baird’s set, 
subtly accented with quaint, 
retro furniture, checkered 
linoleum floors and warm 
fill lights, places the audience 
directly in the cozy living 
room scene. It’s a near-perfect 
environment for the play’s 
naive and lovable characters, 
many of whom carry out con-
versations on the stairwells, 
creating a uniquely intimate 
experience for the viewer. 
Around the stage, the iconic 
winding fire escapes from 
“West Side Story” tower over 
the daydreaming Candelarias, 
monumentalizing both the 
setting of the play and the 
thrilling climb to the top of 
Broadway fame. 

Hailing from a variety 
of theatrical backgrounds, 
each actor of the five-person 
cast makes evident his or 
her preferred style, sadly

It’s back. It’s finally back. The cast and producers of Arrested Development are in talks with 
Showtime and Netflix about shooting 
and airing a short season of the cult-
classic television show leading up to 

the release of a feature-length film. I 
very nearly blue myself in excitement. 
I’m sure somewhere out there, Tobias 
did too.

It’s widely agreed upon that FOX’s 
cancellation of the show was the big-
gest little mistake the network has ever 
made (other notable victims include 
most things Joss Whedon-related.) 
After the show’s second season, 
grassroots campaigns — with one 
aptly titled SOB (Save Our Bluths) — 
sprung up in an attempt to save the 
show. Their success in getting a third 
season sadly ended there — the show 
was cancelled after a short season.

Since then, co-creator Mitchell 
Hurwitz dropped hints about a movie, 
and the show’s stars expressed interest 
from time to time. Showtime even had 
plans to save the show in 2006. But 
while this sent fans all atwitter, noth-
ing ever happened — until now. 

From the outside, it may seem dif-
ficult to understand why fans adore 
a show about prickly, self-absorbed 
characters who end up doing incred-
ibly stupid, self-possessed things. But 
part of the show’s charm is its sheer 
and utter absurdity. It’s like being the 
sole sober person in a room full of 
increasingly drunk crazies. It’s funny, 
it’s kind of weird and sometimes you 
don’t even catch the joke the first time 
around. 

And the inside jokes — those are 
references that only devout viewers 
can understand. By devout view-
ers, I mean everybody from the man 
who dropped $350 on one of Buster’s 
prosthetic hands, to the less crazy 
but equally devoted fans who have 
seen every season on Netflix. Or the 
ones who attended the New Yorker 
Festival’s “Bluth Family Reunion” and 
watched as the cast did the infamous 
“chicken dance.” 

Among the most notable quotes 
are “Who would want to R her?”, “Get 
rid of the Seaward” and “She was his 
cousin, Maeby.” These recurring inside 
jokes and the consequential feeling 
of community amongst the show’s 
fans created a solid base that has car-
ried on even today. After all, who else 
would be reposting the announce-
ment on Tumblr or retweeting the 
Entertainment Weekly article that 
started it all.

As for the actual proposed eight- 
or nine-episode run, each episode is 
expected to serve as a catch-up for an 
individual character. Hurwitz appar-
ently realized while writing the script 
that after he had adequately caught up 
with every single character, the movie 
was halfway over. This way, the televi-
sion series would act as a backstory to 
the proposed movie sequel. It’s a solid 
plan — one that I hope will happen. 
The cast has even announced the fact 
that they are keeping their schedules 
free for production. Optimism acti-
vated.

S cience-themed Biophilia is being marketed as the “future of music.” Recorded 
on an iPad, the album uses invent-
ed instruments and comes with 
interactive apps for every song. But 
the techno-gimmicks ultimately 
distract from the music itself — 
tracks which have Björk going 
back to basics and crafting sound-
scapes that, while gorgeous, aren’t 
anything we haven’t heard from 
the Icelandic singer before.

Each song on the album is 
related to a scientific concept 
(tectonic plates, viruses, moon 
phases), and they fit seamlessly, 
blending together in a parade of 
tinny electronics and flute sounds 

strongly reminiscent of 2001’s 
Vespertine. 

Opener “Moon” sets the 
scene with harp-like strings (à 
la Joanna Newsom) and breathy 
vocals that repeat throughout the 
10 tracks. These IDM influences 
continue on tracks like “Solstice” 
and “Cosmogony,” the latter of 
which comes off as a love ballad, 
with straightforward vocals that 
are a far cry from the shrieks and 
vocal acrobatics Björk is known 
for. Instead, we have quiet, layered 
voices combining over the eternal 
plinking. 

“Sacrifice”’s dark, discordant 
synth makes it a highlight, but only 
“Crystalline” and “Mutual Core” 
evolve into a hard-edged electronic 
racket. These songs stand out from 
the mellow beauty of an album 
that is, despite its sci-fi theme, full 
of the tiny rhythms and minimal-
ism we already know instead of the 
clanging invitations to a mysteri-
ous future we’d hoped for.

M ost of Cymbals Eat Guitars were in their late teens when their debut Why 
There Are Mountains dropped in 
2009. A few new band members, 
opening dates and album-of-the-year 
nods later, the scrappy ’90s-indie 
revivalists now face their greatest 
challenge yet: staying relevant in a 
formidable sea of scrappy ’90s-indie 
revivalists.

Thankfully, on sophomore album 
Lenses Alien, Cymbals Eat Guitars 
take new stylistic risks while paying 
tribute to their indie-rock forefathers.  

Aside from the album’s eight-
and-a-half minute roller coaster 
opener “Rifle Eyesight (Proper 
Name),” Lenses Alien contains 

some of Cymbals’ most concise and 
straightforward rock songs to date, 
with most clocking in at under three 
minutes. The result is a sampler 
platter of musical influences. Songs 
like piano-driven “Shore Points” and 
riff-heavy “Keep Me Waiting” exhibit 
the quaint, lo-fi bedroom rock of 
Built to Spill and the Shins, while 
“Wavelengths” successfully dons a 
pleasant, alt-country twang.

Singer Joseph D’Agostino also 
sounds more focused, effectively flip-
ping through his scrapbook of indie 
legends — Stephen Malkmus’ eccen-
tric drawl on “Definite Darkness,” 
Conor Oberst’s mournful croon on 
“Another Tunguska,” Isaac Brock’s 
primal yelp on “Secret Family” — all 
while retaining his own nasally, teen-
age inflection. 

While admittedly not as inventive 
as the band’s thrilling debut, Lenses 
Alien serves as an interesting and 
successful experiment — the sound 
of a promising new band challenging 
itself to grow.

highlighting “Somewhere”’s incon-
sistency more than its diversity. 
Seasoned Broadway vet Priscilla 
Lopez (“In the Heights,” “A Day in 
Hollywood/A Night in Ukraine”) too 
often seems claustrophobic — her 
excessive gesturing and Vaudevillian 
over-acting proving awkwardly 
distracting in such close quarters. 
Lopez’s cartoonishness is further 
amplified when paired with Rua’s 
downplayed realism — the duo’s 
conversations consequently exude 
unintended surrealism in nearly 
every scene.

But Matthew Lopez’s breezy 
script and likable, uncomplicated 
characters make these snags easy 
to overlook. Juan Javier Cardenas’ 
Brando-loving Francisco Candelaria 
is consistently hilarious, from his 
straight-faced delivery during the 
opening scene’s mock gun battle to 

his extended slapstick routine while 
miming Alejandro’s freshly-penned 
script. Leo Ash Evens’ confusing but 
nevertheless entertaining role as fam-
ily friend Jamie MacRae (the only 
non-Candelaria in the play) provides 
the apparently necessary token white 
guy/tap dancing, as well as some of 
the production’s more impressive 
choreography.  
In fact, the dancing almost always 
overshadows the plot. Choreographer 
Greg Graham’s intricate numbers 
interrupt “Somewhere”’s soap opera 
sentimentalism, transporting us to an 
impressionistic dream wherein char-
acters reveal their emotions through 
raw movement. 

Though the gorgeous production 
and memorable characters point 
to an undeniable heart at its core, 
“Somewhere”’s harmless, generic sto-
rytelling prevents the play from ever 
transcending a pleasant two-step 
down memory lane.

The Univer
sity of Ca

lifornia 

will pay back
 $38 million

 in fees to 

students in 
professional 

programs, 

after a San Fr
ancisco Supe

rior Court 

judge ruled 
on March 1

0 that the 

university h
ad raised fe

es illegally 

from 2003 to
 2007.

According t
o evidence 

present-

ed througho
ut the case, 

— Andrea 

Luquetta et. al v
. Regents of the 

University of Cali
fornia — official 

university do
cuments, inc

luding an 

online fee g
uide, stated

 that fees 

would not be
 increased fo

r continu-

ing students 
at any point 

throughout 

their period 
of enrollmen

t. 

The court ru
led that thes

e mate-

rials constitu
ted a contra

ct, which 

the universit
y then violat

ed.

“The contrac
t between th

e plain-

tiff student
s and the 

university 

included a bi
nding comm

itment not 

to raise the 
professional 

degree fees 

for continui
ng students,

” Superior 

Court Judge
 John Munte

r said in a 

statement.
The ruling 

applies to 
nearly 

3,000 studen
ts who enro

lled in UC 

professional 
schools — 

including 

law, business
 and medicin

e — before 

August 25, 2
003.

Four student
s from schoo

ls such 

as the UCL
A School o

f Law and 

UCSF Schoo
l of Medicine

 contacted 

law firm Al
tshuler Berz

on LLP in 

2007 to take 
up their case

 against the 

university.
Danielle Le

onard, who
 works 

for the firm
, said that 

while fee 

increases ma
y be necessar

y, students 

must be info
rmed of the 

possibility 

of such incre
ases before th

ey go into 

effect. In this
 case, studen

ts were not 

notified
“The court 

concluded t
hat the 

university ha
d breached it

s contracts 

with the st
udents for 

the price 

of their ed
ucation, be

cause the 

university ha
d promised t

o keep the 

amount of t
he professio

nal degree 

fee constant 
for the perio

d of their 

enrollment, 
and then vi

olated that 

promise,” Le
onard said.

Over the 
last several

 years, 

the universi

both underg

A week after
 A.S. Counci

l first 

met to appoi
nt the 2010-1

1 associ-

ate vice presid
ents, one of t

he three 

remaining pos
itions is still un

filled — 

leaving the co
uncil to enter 

next year 

without a full
 cabinet of 10

 AVPs in 

charge of ma
naging variou

s aspects 

of student life
. 

On May 26, 
the council v

oted 

against appoin
ting A.S. Presid

ent Wafa 

Ben Hassine’s 
nominations f

or three 

AVP position
s. The nomin

ations of 

former Campu
swide Senator

 Desiree 

Prevo for the A
VP of Academ

ic Affairs 

position, and 
former AVP 

of Local 

Affairs Aries 
Yumul for the

 AVP of 

College Affair
s position we

re voted 

down, while
 the nomin

ation of 

Eleanor Roose
velt College so

phomore 

Arohi Sharma
 for the AVP o

f Student 

Advocacy posi
tion was tabled

. 

On June 3, th
e council app

roved 

Prevo and Sha
rma to tempo

rarily fill 

the Academic
 Affairs and 

Student 

Advocacy po
sitions, resp

ectively. 

They will car
ry out the AV

P posi-

tions until We
ek Four of Fal

l Quarter 

at which poin
t applications

 for the 

position will r
eopen. 

The position 
of AVP of Co

llege 

Affairs was no
t discussed an

d will not 

be filled until 
Fall Quarter. 

According to
 Ben Hassin

e, all 

three position
s were tabled

 at the 

Campus Affai
rs committee 

meeting, 

which is held
 prior to the

 council 

meeting. From
 that, the Ac

ademic 

Affairs and S
tudent Advoc

acy posi-

tions were pul
led out of com

mittee to 

be discussed a
t the meeting.

 

Ben Hassine 
said the posi

tions 

were tabled —
 and then vot

ed down 

—  because 
councilmemb

ers dis-

agreed with th
e process of c

hoosing 

members for 
the selection 

commit-

tee. The select
ion committee

 consists 

of the preside
nt, the outgo

ing AVP 

and three to fo
ur council sena

tors.

In less th
an two hours 

last night, the
 A.S. Council

 voted 17-2 to
 

shut down the
 Grove Cafe, e

ffectively endi
ng a 24-year s

aga that 

included num
erous attempt

s to revitalize 
the struggling

 eatery. 

The decision c
omes a year af

ter the previou
s council voted

 last June 

to continue op
erating the co

ffee shop, whi
ch was $140,0

00 in debt at 

the time. How
ever, despite o

ngoing renova
tions and a m

uch-hyped 

reopening this
 Winter Quart

er, the busines
s has increased

 its debt over 

$35,000, to a t
otal of nearly 

$180,000. 

According to
 both Vice P

nced last Frida

“One of the th
ings we’ve bee

n ask-

ing is that the 
[nurse-to-pati

ent] ratio 

should be ma
intained at al

l times,” 

UCSD Medica
l Center - Hill

crest reg-

istered nurse J
anice Webb sa

id. “We’re 

asking for brea
k-relief nurses

. That’s a 

nurse that com
es in and watc

hes your 

patient while y
ou’re on break

.”

The protest, sl
ated to be the l

argest 

nurse strike in
 U.S. history, 

will also 

include an ad
ditional 14,00

0 nurs-

es from Calif
ornia and M

innesota, 

totaling 25,00
0 participants

.

California law
 requires hos

pitals 

to maintain 
at least one 

nurse for 

every three to
 five patients,

 depend-

ing on the ca
re the patient

s receive. 

The union sa
id it wants to

 mandate 

stronger enfo
rcement of th

ese laws 

and establish s
afe ratios at al

l times. 

According to 
Webb, the me

dical 

centers do not
 have enough 

nurses to 

attend the pat
ients.

 “We’ve been
 having mee

tings 

with hospitals
 that say they

 already 

have charge 
nurses, but r

ealistical-

ly they can’t 
maintain the 

ratio on 

breaks,” she sa
id. “A lot of tim

es when 

the charge n
urses [or nu

rses who

tch, there are 

still more

However, in a

the UC Office
 of the Presid

ent con-

tended that s
uch a strike i

“The univers

The strike w

“The other th

Students from 50 states and 90 countries congregated on 
campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University this week-
end, held April 1 to 3. �e conference is devoted to developing 
and implementing projects (called commitments) to global 
issues, such as poverty, pollution, LGBT rights and college af-
fordability.  

About 1,200 students entered the conference with individ-
ual commitments, 200 of which were from UCSD.  Students 
were required to apply to be participate.

�e Clinton Global Initiative is part of the Clinton Foun-
dation, founded by former U.S. president Bill Clinton in 2005.  
Now hosting its fourth conference, the CGIU has been to uni-
versities in New Orleans, Texas and Miami.  

Clinton was on hand for the weekends event, and other 
guests included Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs, actor Sean Penn 
and singer Mandy Moore.  Jacobs participated in the opening 
session, while Moore spoke at the �rst workshop on global 
health and Penn appeared at the closing session. Students were 
also able to attend a variety of panels and workshops to prepare 
them to ful�ll their commitment to face issues such as popula-
tion growth, the environment and global health.

You believe you can make a di�erence, and were going 
to help you, Clinton said at the April 1 opening session. �e 
most important question is how do you propose to do it [com-
mitment] and college students are more prone for that ques-
tion.

CGI U Campus Representative Melissa Etehad, who at-
tended CGI U in Miami last year, expressed her excitement 
over the events international scope.

Its an international event for UCSD, and imagine 200 stu-
dents changing the world, Etehad said. I am so excited for the

Carlsbad resident Julio Angel Garcia-Puente, 50, 
will go to trial for murder and arson charges following 
a hearing held March 30. He is suspected of killing his 
estranged wife  38-year-old Lorena Gonzalez, whose 
body was found in a burning vehicle in the P701 
parking lot next to the UCSD baseball field.

At the preliminary hearing to determine if probable 
cause exists to indict Garcia-Puente, San Diego 

Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Fraser 
concluded that the prosecutors 
provided sufficient evidence for the 
case to stand trial, the San Diego 
Union-Tribune reported on March 
30.

San Diego firefighters testified 
that they arrived in the parking lot 

at approximately 8:30 p.m., when they 
found the vehicle in flames. According to the Union-
Tribune, firefighter Justin Price said that when he 
opened one of the car doors, he saw a head and an 
arm. Investigators determined that the vehicle was 
intentionally set on fire.

According to the Union-Tribune, deputy district 
attorney Nicole Rooney testified that Gonzalez died 
of strangulation, as three bones in her neck were

A
fter five months of planning, A.S. Concerts and Events 
Media Liaison Oliver Zhang sat down with the Guardian 
Sunday afternoon to leak the lineup for the annual Sun 
God Festival.

For me, its the best lineup weve ever had, Zhang said of the 
May 13 festival. 

Rapper Wiz Khalifa will be headlining the main stage, while 
Jesse F. Keeler (JFK) of electronic music duo MSTRKRFT will be 
the main act at the dance tent. 

Best Coast, Mike Posner, Jimmy Eat World and Crystal Castles 
will also play the main stage. The support for the dance tent  as 

well as one more act for the main stage  will be revealed once 
the artist contracts are completed.

Not all contracts are fully executed, Zhang said. When we 
release something we want to make sure that the contracts are 
fully valid, just in case they back out at the last minute.

Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events Brian Wong 
said he is proud of the lineup.

the success of 2010, he said in an email. To make this years

“Fiercely independent” student radio station KSDT has given up on plans to obtain an FM frequency. Station managers are now looking to build a radio tower to pursue an AM frequency instead.KSDT station co-manager Meredith Wong said that the AM tower would cost approximately $100,000 and that she hoped it could be located in a central area of campus — although she was unsure where that would be. 

“We’re really serious about it, but we haven’t started much of the research,” Wong said.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger presented his revised 2010-11 state budget last week, a plan that includes a new round of fund-ing increases for public colleges, but that suggests cutting $3.7 bil-

lion from health-care services that impact low-income families who depend on state welfare programs. The suggested allocations to the University of California are nearly identical to the ones from Schwarzenegger’s January propos-al, including the restoration of the $305 million cut last year and an additional $51.3 million in finan-cial aid toward the 5,121 eligible students in the system who are not currently being funded. However, the governor’s newest budget would negate his January proposal to cut $111.8 million set aside to 

accommodate growing enrollment  in the UC and CSU systems. In order to absorb California’s $19.1 billion budget deficit, other services would suffer major cuts — including a proposed $3.7 billion from in health care, that would cut the Medi-Cal program for the poor, along with state in-home support for the disabled. In addi-tion, the budget takes into account Proposition 98 — which passed in 1988 and guarantees a minimum pool of money for schools. Under

T his year’s Sun God Festival — with acts like B.o.B, Relient K, Michelle Branch and headliner Drake — attracted a packed house on May 14. For the second time in Sun God history, all 16,500 student wristbands and 3,500 guest tickets sold out.      In 2008, the first time this happened, tickets didn’t sell out until the day before. This year, all tickets sold out by 2:30 p.m. on Friday, at which time students were turned away.According to Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events Alex Bramwell — who organized this year’s Sun God Festival — the sell-out was due to the popularity of the event’s leading acts.
“We get complaints and yelled at when stu-dents can’t bring their guests, but at the same time, we get yelled at and complaints when the 

students can’t bring themselves — so finding a good balance between those two is tough,” Bramwell said. “We had the same numbers as last year. It just turned out this year to be more popular of an event; more students wanted to come.”
At the 2008 Sun God Festival — when students wristbands were distributed for the entire week leading up to the event — tickets ran out on Thursday, leading students to pur-chase all the leftover guest tickets for them-selves that Friday. 

In 2009, students waited in line for up to four hours on the morning of the festival to receive their wristbands. Despite the crowds, however, over 1,000 of last year’s wristbands went unclaimed.

Capobianco and Lindsay Mills onto 
the field.

"The depth we have is great,” 
Capobianco said. “The play doesn't 
drop at all when our subs come in. 
If anything, most of the time they'll 
raise the game, because that's when 
the other team is getting tired."

With eight minutes remaining 
in the first half, 
Mills connected 
with Capobianco, 
who threaded 
through the cen-
ter of the Otter 
backline and 
sunk a left-footed 
shot from about 
25 yards out.

Going into 
the second half 
with a 3-0 lead, 
the Tritons con-
tinued to push 
upfield.

Again, Capobianco dribbled her 
way through midfield and found 
redshirt freshman forward Izzy 
Pozurama running on. Pozurama — 
who has seen significant playing time 
in the past few contests — easily 
scored to tally her second goal of the 
season.

And with just 50 seconds remain-
ing, Mills and Capobianco connected 
again, as Capobianco finished her 
second goal to end the game at 5-0.

"It's always hard playing teams like 
[CSU Monterey Bay], because we're 
expected to win these games,” junior 
midfielder Jessica Wi said. “Really, all 
the pressure's on us. We have every-
thing to lose and they have nothing 
to lose."

On Sunday, the No. 2 Tritons 
faced off against CSU East Bay, a 
North division squad that has only 
one conference win this season.

The Pioneers came out hot to open 
the match, and in the 11th minute 
East Bay forward Eugénie Foote beat 
senior goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong 
with a shot to the upper corner.

The goal was Foote's third of the 
season, as well as one of only three 
goals to have been scored against 
Armstrong in eight matches.

"We came out a little too con-
fident and the goal against us gave 

us a reality check," 
junior forward 
Gabi Hernandez 
said.

Down 1-0, 
UCSD proceed-
ed to pepper the 
Pioneer goal, out-
shooting CSU East 
Bay 8-1 in the sub-
sequent 20 min-
utes. 

Sensing fatigue 
in the Pioneer 
defense, McManus 
fielded a batch of 

fresh legs to run the widths, bringing 
on junior midfielder Alexa Enlow, 
Mills and junior transfer Britnee 
Chesney. 

Minutes later, the Tritons were 
granted a free kick.

In the 30th minute Johnson sent 
a ball into the back post. Chesney 
beat her defender, volleying the ball 
in to score.

Tied 1-1 at the start of the second 
half, junior defender Ellen Wilson 
bypassed the midfield in favor of 
playing a long ball over the Pioneer 
backline. 

Wi got on the end of it and sent a 
low shot into the far post to give the 
Tritons the lead.

Just seven minutes later, McTigue 
put a header past the Pioneer goal-
keeper off a service from Johnson to 
put the game at 3-1.

Wi would tally two assists before 

the end of the match, serving balls 
in from out-wide for Dixon and 
Hernandez to score.

The Tritons will continue to play 
against the CCAA North Division 
by taking a trip up north to face off 
against two of the strongest teams in 
the conference.

On Friday Oct. 7, UCSD will kick 
off against 5-2-1 Chico State in Chico. 
The Wildcats are currently the top-
ranked team in the North Division, 
and have collected wins in three out 
of their past four matches. 

On Sunday Oct. 9, the Tritons 
will face off against CSU Stanislaus 
in Turlock.

“The games against Chico and 
Stanislaus are going to be really 
important, because both teams are 
at the top of the North Division,” 
Armstrong said. “And also because 
we only have a chance to play the 
teams up North once in conference 
play.”

into the penalty area, which argu-
ably could have led to penalty kick 
opportunities. 

Defensively, the Triton back-
line — junior Harris Rabin and 
sophomores Josh Van de Vrugt and 
Lamming, sitting in front of red-
shirt sophomore goalkeeper Jesse 
Brennan — did well to keep the 
net clean. 

In his last four games, Brennan 
allowed only one goal and tallied 
16 saves.

 When asked about the effec-
tiveness of the Triton defense in 
the past few matches, Lamming 
attributes the success to the work 
ethic of the team as a whole.

"The whole team's playing 
defense, it's not just the back line," 
Lamming said. "Starting from 
the forwards, everyone's working 
together, everyone's playing well, 
everyone's trying as hard as they 
can to get the ball back as soon as 
they lose it."

On Sunday, the Tritons posted 
another shutout, beating CSU East 
Bay by their largest margin of the 
season so far, 3-0.

The first goal came just 57 sec-
onds in, when Wolfrom played a 
lofted ball into the front post for 
Ball, who struck the ball into the 
net for his first goal of the season.

“The early goal really helped 
to swing the momentum in our 
favor,” Walker said. “It was great 
for three of our players to get their 
first goals of the season.”

In the 30th minute, freshman 
midfielder Franco Cruz sliced his 
way through the midfield to find 
Portela on the left flank. 

Portela let fly a cross that 
deflected off the crossbar, landing 
at the feet of junior midfielder 
Kian Malek, who headed the ball 
past the Pioneer goalkeeper.

Walker capped the game by 
putting the Tritons up 3-0. Arsht 
found Walker in the 57th minute, 
who positioned himself one-on-
one with the keeper. 

Walker, who worked himself 
back into the starting eleven after 
sustaining an injury last season, 
pushed the ball into the net to 
score his first goal of the season.

“I was really happy to get my 
first goal of the year, and I hope I 

can add to that tally this weekend,” 
Walker said. 

With the pair of shutouts the 
Tritons take six points in the 
CCAA standings. 

And with the three straight 
wins, UCSD has pulled themselves 
above .500, with a 6-4 overall 
record and a 5-3 record in the 
CCAA.

 “It was really important for us 
to get our first six point weekend of 
the year,” Walker said. “Hopefully 
we can carry this win streak into 
the coming weekend against Chico 
and Stanislaus.”

The Tritons will head up North 
for their next batch of games. 

On Friday Oct. 7, UCSD is set 
to face off against 4-2-2 Chico 
State. The Wildcats hold the sec-
ond spot in the CCAA North divi-
sion and, like the Tritons, have put 
together shutouts in their last three 
matches.

On Sunday, UCSD will head 
to Turlock for a test against CSU 
Stanislaus.

Tritons String Together Third Straight Win 

No. 2 UCSD Continues Undefeated Streak

MEN’S SOCCER PLAYER RATINGS: UCSD vs. CSUMB

CORY WOLFROM   4
Wolfrom had a slow start and a few tough touches, but his play definitely 
improved after he was put back onto the pitch in the second half.

GAVIN LAMMING    7
The sophomore sweeper was composed on the ball and did well to marshal his 
back line. 

HARRIS RABIN    6
One of the most consistent performers for the Tritons, Rabin worked hard up and 
down the flanks and shut down his mark in the back.

ALEC ARSHT   5
The normally solid midfielder had a little trouble controlling the ball in the center, 
but had some good runs going forward.

EVAN WALKER   4
Walker worked hard up and down the flanks, but had a difficult time making an 
impact in the run of play.

ALEX PORTELA   5
Portela had a few tough touches, and early in the match had a hard time finding 
frame, but in the end was in the right place at the right time to put the game away.

SAM BALL   8
Always active in the final third for the Tritons, the forward’s frenetic play caused 
trouble for the CSUMB defense.

JOSH VAN DE VRUGT   5
Van de Vrugt was solid in the backline. He did well against his mark, but did little 
to advance the play forward.

TAYLOR WIRTH   5
Wirth put in the work, but at times seemed lost in the middle of the pitch and had 
trouble dealing with the physicality of the match.

ANDREW KEIMACH   8
Keimach was an enforcer in the back, and coming off the bench, brought energy 
on both ends of the pitch.

JESSE BRENNAN    7
CSUMB only tallied one shot on goal for the game, but Brennan was solid in the 
back, and made a diving save late in the game to record the shutout.

KIAN MALEK    4
Defenses usually have a tough time dealing with Malek’s speed, but coming off 
the bench, Malek had a difficult time working himself into the game.

FOUR WIN WEEKEND
BY RACHEL UDA • SPORTS EDITOR

Both Triton soccer squads posted 
two wins this weekend, collectively 
outscoring there opponents 14-1.

On Friday, deep into the second half of a game still drawn 0-0, the Tritons 
continued to chip away at a crum-
bling Monterey Bay back line.

With just 10 minutes left to 
play, sophomore midfielder Cory 
Wolfrom collected a deflected 
shot from junior forward Evan 
Walker. 

Within a crowded 18-yard box, 
Wolfrom found sophomore mid-
fielder Alec Arsht who was just 
able to thread a pass through to 
junior midfielder Alex Portela.

With his third shot of the 
game, Portela fired a ball low and 
hard to the mouth of the goal, 
which slipped through the hands 
of the Monterey Bay keeper, put-

ting the Tritons up 1-0.
"It's a big win for us," sopho-

more defender Gavin Lamming 
said. "It was a tough game, we had 
to grind it out. I thought our team 
stuck together really well. We had 
a lot of early opportunities that 
we didn't put away, but we stuck 
together, played the best that we 
could and had to grind it out until 
we scored at the end."

The goal proved to be the game 
winner, but UCSD battled for the 
1-0 advantage up and down the 
pitch.

The two teams tallied 16 fouls 
and four yellow cards — three of 
which were issued to UCSD. 

On two occasions, sophomore 
forward Sam Ball was shouldered

The Triton women tallied 10 goals in their past two games, going 5-0 against CSU 
Monterey Bay in their home opener 
Friday, Sept. 30 and 5-1 against CSU 
East Bay on Sunday.

The team is currently No. 2 
nationally and sits undefeated at 
the top of the California Collegiate 
Association, with an 8-0-2 overall 
record and a 7-0-1 CCAA record.

Opening their weekend at home 
against bottom of the conference 
CSU Monterey Bay on Friday, the 
Tritons got off to a quick start. 

In the 11th minute, junior 
defender Hayley Johnson lined up 
for one of the Tritons' nine corner 
kicks of the night. Johnson — who’s 
tied for first in the nation for assists 

per game, having racked up 10 assists 
in 10 appearances — sent the ball to 
senior forward Sarah McTigue, who 
tapped the ball in to score.

Outshooting the Otters 20 shots 
to three, UCSD quickly doubled 
their lead in the 15th minute, when 
junior midfielder Danielle Dixon 
collected the ball on the right side 
of the field. Sitting far up the field 
in an attempt to pull an offside trap, 
the Otter defense failed to cover the 
left midfielder, senior Shelby Wong. 
Dixon sent a lofted ball to the feet of 
Wong, who easily put it away to score 
her second goal of the season.

With a comfortable 2-0 lead, head 
coach Brian McManus showcased 
the depth of his squad by going into 
his bench, bringing seniors Courtney
