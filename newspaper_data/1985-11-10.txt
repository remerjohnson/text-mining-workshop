T HERE ARE APPROXIMATELY five million adult adoptees living in the United States today, 50% of whom will see a mental health 
profeSSional at some point in their lives. 

Although adoptees only make up 2 percent of the 
population, they reponedly account for 30-50 
percent of people seen by mental health counselors. 
A growing theory has emerged attributing this 
imbalance directly to the secrecy which surrounds 
the adoption process, and isolates children from 
their genealOgical past. 

In 1973, Florance Fisher's book, The Search for 
Anna Fisher, created a movement among adoptees 
that protested the policies and laws preventing 
access to the true identities of themselves and their 
parents. Fisher, plus those adoptees who sought out 
their binhbparents despite the low odds, laid the 
groundworks for one of the largest search/suppon 
groups in the United States today, the Adoptees 
Libeny Movement Association (ALMA). 

1 became a member of ALMA in early 1984 and 
located my binhmother last August because of their 
help. After meeting her, I've become convinced 
there exists a psychological need to know the 
identity of one's consanguinal parents. 

The almost universal feelings of isolation or lack 
of complete identity among adoptees is evidence of 
this strong need. According to psychologist Erik 
Erikson, these problems tend to emerge during 
adolescence, the period when one forms a sense of 
self-identity. 

Due to the inaccessability of adoption records, it 
is difficult to estimate how many adoptees actually 
try to locate their binhparents. One sUlvey of 40

adult adoptees by Jean Patton, founder of Orphan 
Voyage , one of the oldest search/ support groups, 
suggests that one half of the adoptees in the United 
States make some effon to locate their birth parents 
at some time during their lives. Another study by 
Margaret Lawrence in 1976 examined 20 adoptees 
and concluded: "There is a profound psychological 
isolation in being unrelated to any other person 
who has ever lived , and to being a stranger who 
never belongs wherever he may be." 

In his introduction to In Search of Origins by John 
Triseliotis, Sanford N. Katz notes that a search for 
one's binhparents is often triggered by a life crisis, 
such as the death of a loved one or by insecurities 
stirred up as adoptees become spouses or parents. 
In speaking with members of ALMA, I noticed that 
the events most often cited for triggering a search 
were pregnancy, childbirth , the death of an 
adoptive parent and becoming a legal adult. Media 
publicity about a search group or a feature on the 
successful completion of a search also brought many 
new members to ALMA. My own search began as a 
result of the binh of my daughter, the first genetic 
relative I ever knew. 

Childbinh can be panicularly frightening for 
adoptees as they often have little information 
regarding their birth families' medical history. My 
family'S medical history, which was given to me by 
the LA County Bureau of Adoptions, contained only 
two words: "Good health". FollOWing my meeting 
with my binhmother 1 discovered that there were 
some allergi~s in the family, high blood pressure, 
diabetes and twO incidents of cancer, one of which 
affected my grandfather ...

Program teaches teen 
health habits 

A new program insti tuted this 
month is intended to help 
adolescents develop healthy and 
responsible eatmg habits. 

The one-year program was 
originally developed at UC San 
Francisco and IS now sponsored 
by the Clinical uuuion 
Depanment at the UCSD Medical 
Center, in conjunction with the 
Division of Adolescent Medicine. 

It provides adolescents with 
information and practical tools to 
help them achieve Significant 
long-term weight loss, according 
to program coordinator 
Marylynne Rice. 

"Many times, these adolescents 
don't see the weight problem as 
their own, but as their parents' 
problem: she said . "We 
encourage them to rake 
responsibility for themselves and 
oITer them ways to recognize 
what changes need to be made 
in their lifestyle and eating 
habits and how to implement 
those changes: 

Currently utilized in more 
than 400 sites throughout the 
country, Shapedown is designed 
for 12-18 year-olds who are 
trying to change their eating 
habits in order to control their 
weight, Rice explained. 

In a small group setting of 
eight to sixteen members, the 
teens discuss common feelings 
and explore new ways to deal 
with their anxieties and 
problems regarding their weight, 
she said. 

Shapedown is not a short term 
weight loss program, but rather 
designed to promote long term 
weight management , Rice said , 
citing a recent follow-up study 
which indicated that 66% of 
program participants continued 

BLOOM COUNTY 

to lose weight and had Improved 
self-esteem fi fteen months after 
the twelve weekly sessions . 

The three-phase program 
combines input from a 
nutritionist, exercise phYSIOlogist, 
family counselor, and adolescent 
med icine physician m order to 
address the vanety of areas 
involved in weight management 

New Provost 
appointments 

Dr. F. Thomas Bond, who has 
served as acting provost of 
Revelle College, has been named 
provost of the college. An 
associate professor of chemistry, 
Bond was named acting provost 
following the departure of Chia-
Weh Woo, who left in 1983 to 
become president of San 
Francisco State University. 
President Gardner approved 
Bond's selection as provost last 
month . 

Physics professor David Wong. 
was named acting provost of 
Warren College, replacing Dr. 
Michael Addison, who returned 
to teaching in the drama 
department. Wong. a native of 
China , has been a member of 
the UCSD faculty since 1960. A 
search for a full time provost will 
begin during the winter quarter 
of 1986. 

Regents' budget 
student fees rise 

Regents of the University of 
California have adopted a 
proposed operating budget of 
$4.5 billion for 1986-87 that 
includes a $1.9 billion request for 
state funding, up 11 .7 percent 
over this year. 

[n addition, the Regents , 
meeting Oct. 17 and 18 at the 

UC Extension Center in San 
Francisco, apPrQved a new 
policy for setting student fees. 
Under those gUidelines, fees will 
rise 7.5 percent in fall 1986, the 
first increase in three years. 
Education and Registration fees 
for graduate and undergraduate 
students will average $1 ,356 a 
year. 

The Regents also approved a 7 
percent hike .in non-resident 
tu ition , from $3 ,816 to $4 ,086 a 
year beginning n ext faU . Out-of-
state students pay tuition in 
addition to the fees. 

All other items on the agenda 
were approved except for a 
change in the University'S 
standing orders to aUow 
implememauon of a South 
Africa-free supplemenral 
retirement fund . That item was 
deferred to the November 
meeting. 

The ~,.n W CIl'~alI 
South Africa 'S government 
prohibits domestic or 
international media coverage of 
public unrest. News agencies call 
this unwarranted censorship; 
South Africa officials say their 
goal is to reduce violence. 
New York Mayor Ed Koch says 
the city, in order to cum the 
spread of AIDS, will seek to close 
certain gay bath clubs that allow 
sex. 
Moscaw Prime Minister 
Gomachev's new guidelines set 
less specific standard-of-living 
goals than Kruschev's, but call for 
improved expon and consumer 
goods and "peaceful coexistence" 
with the West. 
Washington President Reagan says 
Democrats on the House Ways 
and Means Committee are trying 
to "water down" his tax reform 
plan, in which he attempts to 
reduce the number of rax 
deductions. 
New Zealand Prime Minister 
Lange denies a deal with the 
French government regarding the 
sentencing of twO French agents 
accused in last July's sinking of 
the Greenpeace ship Rainbow 
Warrior.

SOURCE for student 
organization funding 
STUDENTS ORGAN[ZING University Resources through Community 
Exchange (SOURCE) is an 
Associated Students organization 
that raises funds "to improve the 
quality of student life and 
services at UCSD and 10 promote 
community and student 
interaction on a personal level," 
according to Cathy Chow, a 
SOURCE coordinator 

Staff members of SOURCE 
contact San Diego corporations, 
offices and 'homes to volunteer 
UCSD student organizations' 
time and energies in exchange 
for rax-deductible donations 
ranging from $50 to $200. 
SOURCE hopes to raise $10,000 
this year. Participating clubs will 
receive 2S percent of the funds; 
the remaining 7S percent is 
earmarked for an annual project. 

The second weeks of Winter 
and Spring quarters have been 
designated SOURCE weeks. 
During the week of January 12, 
student volunteers will do 
inventory for local depanment 
stores. Student organizations are 
encouraged to particpate not 
only to raise group funds, Chow 
said, but to enhance community 
awareness of their organization 
and 10 give students a navor of 
the working world relative to 
their major as well . 

Last vear SOURCE raised 

$5000 tor UCSD and placed 88 
students from the Ski Club , 
Circle K and fraternities in 
vqlunteer positions throughout 
the community. Students 
sponsored by the San Diego Gas 
and Electric Company assisted 
in the Crime Victims 
Fundraising BaD and assisted 
with their 10K foot-race. 
Students also performed filing 
and typing at local banks, 
libraries, and museums, while 
others did research in law 
offices. The funds raised were 
used to purchase and maintain 
information kiosks for the 
campus. SOURCE has an 
honorary board of directors 
consisting of community leaders 
and business people who have 
shown interest in UCSD in the 
past, Chow said. Members 
include Rita Atkinson, U.c. 
Regent Frank Hope, San Diego 
businessman John O'Brien, 
UCSD alumna Maureen 
O'Conner, biology professor Dr. 
Nicholas Spitzer and Vice 
President of Global Corporation 
Dr. Keith Kedward. 

SOURCE is in its second year 
of existence at UCSD. 

Students interested in SOURCE 
can contact Cathy Chow or Mary 
Rose Alexander at 452-4450 or 
can visit the SOURCE office 
upstairs in the Student Center.

Workshop on teaching kids to read 
In an age of video games and 

television reruns, many parents 
and teachers are finding it 
increaSingly more difficult to 
teach and encourage children to 
read. 

On November 16, 
internationally renowned child 
psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, 
Ph.D. , will conduct a one-day 
workshop through UCSD 
Extension on problems in 
teaching children to read. 

Bettelheim, known for his 
work with autistic children, will 
discuss why and how children 
teach themselves to read, the 
books that stimulate or dull a 
child's mind, factors in the home 
environment that encourage or 
discourage love of reading, the

emotional factors that cause a

child's misreading can be seen 
as intuition rather than as a

Bettelheim, a professor of 
education and professor of 
psychology emeritus at the 
University of Chicago, is the 
author of a number of books, 
including his most recent (with 
Karen Zelan), On Learning to

Students plan space 
shuttle Getaway 
By KARIN JACOBSEN, Slaff Wriltr 

STUDENTS AT UCSD and SDSU may ha~ a chance to launch their experiments 
into space aboard a "Getaway 
Special" (a small, self-contained 
payload on the Space Shuttle) as 
soon as eighteen months from 
now. The project is being 
planned by the San Diego 
chapter of the American Institute 
of Aeronautics and Astronautics 
(AIM), a trade and profeSSional 
organization with chapters at 
many major universities. The 
project is being entirely student 
deSigned, buih and managed, 
according to Nomert Carte, a 
systems science engineering 
student in charge of organizing 
the project. 

Carte explained the project 
Wednesday at an AlAA club 
meeting. The payload will be as . 
cubic foot, 200 pound cylinder, 
nicknamed a 'gas can.' 
Experiments will be bolted onto 
the lid of the canister which will 
be loaded into the payload bay 
of the Space Shuttle. The 
Getaway Special will be 
completely self-contained, 
supplying its own power' after 
astrona uts activate a switc her 
tube in the payload bay. 

The UCSD/ SDSU project 
proposal includes an electrical 
engineering experiment that will 

measure variations in solar flux. 
Carte explains flux as "the 
amount of solar radiation flowing 
into the atmosphere. 

"Photo diodes placed on the 
lid of the gas can would measure 
variations from solar granulation 
very accurately: he said . Dr. 
Hugh Hudson, a resident 
physicist at the Center for 
Astrophysics and Space Sciences 
will aid in designing the 
experiment. Hudson is "the 
world's leading expert on 
variation in the solar constant" 
according to Carte. 

Another experiment will 
measure the propagation of 
chemical waves in oscillation. 
"We'd use the photo diode to 
take pictures of chemical waves 
propagating through solutions to 
see how zero gravity affects 
various reactions," Carte said. 

A third experiment would 
place polymers on the lid of the 
gas can to measure types of 
radiation damage occuring in 
zero gravity. "This project has 
been done before, but not on 
thick polymers (over 4/ 1000 
inch thick). By using stronger 
samples, we can distinguish 
between surface degradation -and 
actual radiation effects," Carte 
said. 

While this will be the first

space shuttle venture led by 
students at UCSD and SDSU, 
other universities and private 
companies have already sent 
expriments aboard space 
shuttles. The first Geraway 
Special Dew in 1983 when eight 
Utah State University students 
from various scientific fields sent 
projects in a gas can aboard a 
space shuttle. "Anyone can do it, 
you JUSt need to pay the price: 
Carte said. 

NASA charges $10,000 for the 
payload canister, launch 
planning and scheduling 
support, installation in the 
shuttle bay, crew control systems, 
and return of the payload 
following the mission. Students 
are responsible for constructing 
their payload and experiments, 
testing them, helping NASA 
inspect them and transporting 
them to the launch site. Funds 
for the UCSD/SDSU Getaway 
Special will come from the AlAA 
and private industry. 

The Getaway Special program 
was initiated by NASA in 1976 to 
utilize the average of 25 percent 
of uncommitted shuttle bay 
weight and volume available on 
each flight. The NASA program 
permits customers a way to use 
some left-over capacity while not 
requiring the project to pay 
primary shuttle payload prices. 
The program enables industry, 
academic institutions, private 
citizens and the u.s. government 
to test small-scale experiments in 
space at low costs. 

"BaSically AlAA is sponsoring 
the program to give students an 
opportunity to actually use their 
engineering skills, to design and 
build the payload, then launch 
experiments into space," said 
Carte, who is interested primarily 
in the design and management 
aspects of the project. "We need 
people to help out in the 
engineering aspects as well as 
ideas and plans for the 
experiments. " 

Cane encourages any students 
interested in helping to design 
and build the payload, or 
devising and implementing the 
experiments to contact the AIM 
office at the Student Center. ~

UACIR report 
tops Regent's agenda 
By DENNIS WOO, News Edilor 

U CtA CHANCELLOR Charles Young, chairman of the UC committee on 
Investor Responsibility (UACIR), 
will present UACIR's initial 
report to the Committee on 
Investments at a UC Board of 
Regents meeting on Friday at 
UClA 

After separate consideration of 
each corporation in the UC 
investment portfoliO, the UACIR 
concluded that some did not 
appear to meet the requirement 
for good corporate citizenship. 
The committee decided that 
Young would notify' each 
corporation and give each a 
specified period of time to meet 
the good citizenship requirement 
or to provide the committee with 
information to cause it to reverse 
its position. 

Established by the UC Regents 
in June 10 advise UC President 
David Gardner, the UACIR grew 
out of discussions about UC 
investments in American 
companies in South Africa. The 
nine-member committee formed 
of faculty, staff, student and 
alumni held an organizational 
meeting in Los Angeles last 
month. 

Instructions given to the 
committee by President Gardner 
ask for a "review on a case-by-
ease basis of the quality 
corporate citizenship of 
companies included in the 
University's investment ponfolio, 
and of banks and finanCial 
institutions with which the 
University places its funds." 

The instructions by Gardner 
also directed the committee to 
"regard the vigorous promotion 
of racial equality by companies 
doing business in South Africa as 
being required by the 
University's definition of good 
corporate citizenship" and to 
"review the performance of such 

companies on a case-by-case 
basis using the Sullivan 
Principles or an eqUivalent code 
of conduct" as a standard of 
measurement. 

[f the companies under 
consideration do not take 
actions toward meeting the -
requirements , the UACIR will 
recommend "appropriate action" 
including possible divestment, to 
the Regents through Gardner, 
according to a UCLA news 
release. Each of the companies 
reviewed at the meeting has 
responded to inquiries by 
UACIR 

According to a UC Associated 
Students release, the UACIR 
"failed to produce overaU 
investment guidelines." 

"Gaye Seidman and I (UC 
student representatives to the 
UAClR) feel the committee is 
proceeding haphazardly," said 
Francis Hasso of the UC Stlldent 
Body President's Council (SBPC). 
"Before corporate evaluations 
began we wanted coherent 
divestmenLguidelines, but the 
committee ignored us and 
blasted ahead. Already, wavering 
committee members retained a 
company that wasn't even 
making 'good progress' on the 
Sullivan Principles in our 
portfolio . Without guidelines, the 
committee is flounderi ng. It 
might tum out to be a farce, like 
some students have said." 

At their last meeting on 
September 17, the Regents 
approved a South Africa-free 
retirement ponfolio for faculty 
and staff. The Regents' November 
meeting is the last meeting 
scheduled for the 1985 calendar 
year. 

[n addition to hearing Young's 
UACIR report, the Regents will 
discuss UCs efforts to attract 
more minorities and women to 
the system. ~

subversion. UCSD, in its 25th year of existence, is rapidly becoming an 

anachronism. One would think that after our strident history of battling 
for democratic reform within our own walls that our peers would be the 
last ones to turn back the clock. Electoral representation among the 
student body now appears to be an irony, an ambivalent institution, a 
mere prefix for ivory tower politicS. The term, Associate Students 
Council, is a pandora's box; discuss its meaning and then apply it in 
reality - you wonder just who is associated with whom. Not only are 
associations few and far betwep.n the student voter and the council at 
large, but they are contradictory in practice. 

The AS Council has chosen to "leave ASIO virtually independent," so 
they were not inclined to voice any prO[est on this matter. Until a 
student attendant asked the Council last Wednesday evening why they 
had not taken any action to stop this law~ess sponsorship by ASIO, (the 
Concil had not even formally addressed the matter), they answered that 
the Referendum was only supposed to address sponsorships at the . 

Very few people attend AS Council meetings, or pay much attention 
to AS affairs, be they voters or non-voters. The little interest that is 
generated revolves around organizational funding - whether or not 
your group is receiving its fair share of the money pie . This is a sad 
state of university dynamics, for the lack of student interest in their 
own, reasonably accessible government indicates to the UC 
Administration that they have a free hand in creating policy. When 
elected representatives are not exactly adverse to cenain desires of the 
Administration, then the student-voter is left wondering why they ever 
were naive enough to believe that their desires would be properly 
atended to by the very councilmembers that they voted for. 

Career Center, and not at ASIa. They were going to let the event occur, 
you know the governmental addage "just let business go on as usual." 
Can you imagine the uproar this type of coverup would cause if it 
happened on a national scale? For example , if the citizens of the 
United States had voted to ban the production of chemical weapons by 
the Pentagon, and the u.s. government continued to allocate the 
Department of Defense monies (taxpayers' dollars, of course) for the 
development of Agent Orange? 

The Council claims that the Referendum is "only a recommendation ." 
Isn 't that a contradiction in terms? We always thought that a 
"referendum" or Uresolution" was something that is "resolved" - not 
undecided, not open to debate , and not just some form of advice to be 
rendered inappropriate when you feel you are properly obscured from 
public reprimandation. 

Last spring those students who voted in the AS elections expressed in 
a sophisticated manner that they did not want the Central Intelligence 
Agency recruiting on campus. An overwhelming majority voted to pass 
resolution number 2, (Yes- J,i;80, No-843), which explicitly stated that 
student registration fees would not be used to suppon on-campus 
recruitment by either the CIA, FBI, INS, the Secret Service, or the 
military. It happens though, that ASIa has leaflets strewn all-over 
campus advenising summer internships with who else but that bastion 
of humanity - the CIA. In fact, there will be an ASIO meeting 
Wednesday night where you can sit and chat with an ASIO 
representative about this vast opportunity to work hand in hand with 

Maybe it is because student panicipation has been so minimal this 
year that this kind of inaction occurs. There is no sophisticated system 
of checks and balances to prevent such gross violations of student 
interest from happening again. If the AS Council believes that a body 
such as a "student supreme coun" is nO[ necessary to check their 
policies, then we would like to see them enforce the Referendum by 
preventing the ASIa from holding an internship forum which includes 
the CIA. If they choose not to do so, then we would recommend a new 
election be held as soon as possible, so we can all determine whether 
our "recommendations" for AS Council positions were very sound to 
begin with. -Matthew j. Cronin 

Some notes on a cumbersome life 
By DAVE RICHARD 

Today has been a good day. I 
just realized that I'm a double 
major. Political science and 
unemployment. It took me four 
years to realize this. but now that 
I have I feel a sense of 
accomplishment. Originally I 
wanted to be a philosophy 
major. At least philosohy majors 
know why they don't have a job 
when they graduate. 

I heard Mad Jack on the radio 
again. You know, the guy with 
the laugh that breaks windows. If 
ever there was a man who 
should be struck down by strep 

throat, this is the guy. 
Kind of a bizarre thought, but 

why do they call it a "birth 
control pill?" Why not be honest 
and call it a "birth eradication 
pill." Maybe it takes some of the 
romance out of it. I don't know. 

My brother came down from 
Los Angeles a couple weeks ago. 
He asked for directions and I 
sent him to San Ysidro. It took 
him a while to figure it out. I 
wanted to make sure he sawall 
of San Diego before he left. 

My girlfriend broke up with 
me a few months ago. It wouldn't 

be so bad but she has most of 
my T-shirts. I've been sleeping in 
Oxfords for the last six weeks. 
That's not so bad either but I'm 
having trouble getting the clip-on 
ties off. I wake up in the middle 
of the night to get a drink of 
water and I look like I've been 
through one hell of a business 
meeting. 

I've given up on Cabbage 
Patch kids for entertainment. I 
used to spend days with the litde 
guys. Now three or four hours 
tops and I'm bored. 

I watch Dynasty a lot these 

days. I like it for its realistic 
depiction of American life. 
There's nothing like a wedding 
massacre to get my intellect 
piqued. 

I don't go ice skating anymore. 
It occurred to me that if the ice 
melted I would be swimming. I 
don't know how to swim so why 
take the chance. 

I had a great idea for a 
product that I might market. It's 
a highlighter that highlights three 
lines at once. I figure it will save 
the serious student a lot of time. 

My dad is a psychologist. For 
fun I can him up and tell him 
I'm suicidal. He's glad that I take 
an interest in his work. 

Some days I go stand in front 
of the Soviet embassy and 
protest South Africa. I don't want 
them to feel left out. 

A few days ago my phone rang 
and the operator wanted to 
know if I would accept a collect 
phone call from my mom. I 
asked the operator if it was a 
rhetorical question . Well, gotta 
go. ~ 

SDG&E: Lights out on a monopoly 
By GERRI JONES 

The free enterprise system as a 
legitimate economic philosophy 
has helped make America one of 
the richest nations on earth. 
Indeed, the countries that enjoy 
a higher per capita income than 
that of the United Stats can be 
counted on one h~nd . 

It is not a perfect system, of 
co urse, but nonetheless it is 
presently functioning better than 
most other systems operating 
among this planet's 159 
independent countries. 
Competition is the most vital 
component to our free market 
economy. TheoreticaUy, under 
our system, prices are supposed 
to stabilize at a point where the 
producer turns a profit, while 
simult&neously. the product or 
service remains affordable to 
most consumers. Too high a 
price and the producer wiD be 
unable to seD his or her 
merchandise, thus forcing the 

price down. Too Iow a price 
causes heightened demand, so 
that eventually production will be 
unable'to keep pace, resulting in 
a scarcity. The situation, in most 
cases, will work itself out at the

point where supply and demand 
reach equilibrium. When 
competition is removed from the 
equation, trouble is usually in the 
offing. Then. prices of that 
commodity fluctuate. If they 
stabilize at all , it is generally at 
an exorbinant amount. The 
perfect example of a non-
competitive company is our local 
utility, San Diego Gas &: Electric. 

The only com petition SDG&:E 
experiences is when it competes 
with other utilities for the 
dubious honor of achieving the 
highest rates in the nation. 
ConSistently, SDG&:E has been 
among the top 10 utilities in a 
maddening race to obtain a 
higher rate than anyone of the 
hundreds of utilities operating 
across America. Last year, it 
placed second, JUSt behind New 
york City'S Con Edison . 

Absent competition, SDG&E 
has no incentive to harness its 

expenses. All its bills, cost 
overruns and bad judgement 
decisions are simply passed 
along to its hapless customers in 
the form of rate increases after 
cursory review by the California

Public Utilities Commission 
(CPUC) in Sacramento. If any 
small business entrepreneur ran 
his or her operation like SDG&:E 
ran its affairs, that person would 
be bankrupt inside of a year. 

Examples of mismanagement 
inside SDG&:E abound. In the 
19705 SDG&E officials hyped 
the San Onofre nuclear power 
plant, selling the idea to its 
consumers on the pretext that it 
would save us huge sums of 
money in later years. SDG&E 
bigwigs said the plant would cost 
$437 million . We now learn it 
has actually cost $4.5 billion. 
Look up "boondogle" in the 
dictionary and you're liable to 
see a small black-and-white 
photo of San Onofre plan next to 
the word . 

One way or another, SDG&:E 
intends on recouping its losses 
in the plant through future rate

clear: The greatest threat to the 
survival of our specits on Earth 
is the adversarial relationship 
between the two superpowers. 
How can we ever overcome our

One challenge that has to be 
met involves what we in the 
United States call the military-
industrial complex. President 
Dwight Eisenhower warned that 
the financial health of huge 
defense contractors is 
determined by their capacity to 
secure federal contracts to

exists in the Soviet Union. These

United States and the Soviet 
Union should exchange

That hallowed inner circle of 

student government, the movers 
and shakers of time from one 
end of campus to the other, the 
Associated Students of UCSD 
met on a chilly October night to 
discuss assorted odds and ends. 
Among these items were the La 
Jolla Town Council Christmas 
parade. the possibility of 
opening a paraphernalia shop 
(that was the exact word , read 
on) and UCSD's 25th 
anniversary party. 

But you really want to know 
about the paraphernalia shop, 
don't you? It's going to be at the 
end, because we really don't have 
enough coverage of the AS. So 
we're going to cover the AS with 
champagne (or whatever) and 
then we can have fun . 

The first major order of 
business was the AS's proposed 
presentation of a float in the La 
Jolla Town Council Christmas 
parade Sunday, Dec. 1 at 3 pm 
at Girard and Pearl. Now, to say 
that La Jolla isn't exactly 
enamored of its student 
contingency is a bit of an 
understatement. The La Jolla 
Town Council would probably 
like UCSD to be the Salk 
Institute : prestige without panty 
raids; or whatever those students 
want to do. Anyway, the purpose 
of the float is, ironically, to 
improve UCSD's relations with 
La Jolla, and if the AS decides to 
go ahead and build one it should 
make a good impression. To 
show the pearl of the coast we 
aren't that bad, the theme of the 
float should be of course Porky's , 
complete with a naked girl 
jumping out of a cake. We don't 
want to sneer for nothing! A 
Deep Throat also told the 
Guardian an AS member would 
regularly be attending La Jolla 
Town Council Meetings. 

Bring the beer, dude. 
Then there is the California 

Revirn', continually praised by the 
likes of William F. Buckley Jr .. 

George Will and Alexander Haig: 
the symbolic hall of vintage oak, 
Persian rugs and cognac. The AS 
hasn't always been very fond of 
CR. In fact, two years ago there 
was a stUdent referendum in_ 
which the student body voted 
not to fund CR for printing racist 
and homophobic stories. The AS 
voted likewise and CR sued -
and won .. .. One question about 
this incident, regarding a 
constitutional clause stating that 
the AS does have the right to 
withdraw funding, came up, 
wandered around the room, then 
left. 

On a lighter note, don't forget 
about UCSD's 25th Anniversary 
party Nov. 18, on Muir Field 
from 11:30-1:30. Balloons, free 
cake and soda, VIPs galore - it's 
all there. 

Last, but sure as hell not least, 
the proposed paraphernalia shop 
- yes. the word is p-a-r-a-p-h-
e-r-n-a-I-i-a. This gift shop is just 
talk right now. and it may not 
come through , but if it does, the 
shop will stock. among mher 
things, frat T -shins and frat 
etcetera so the boys and girls 
won't have to order by catalogue 
from the national organization. 
It's so tmib!y bothersome! 
Greeks. Paraphernalia. 
Hmmmmmm ... . They don 't 
exacdy play tiddlywinks at frat 
panies and aren't T-shirts and 
stuff like that called 
"accessories ?" 

InCidentally. there is an 
alternative to the Greeks, an anti-
frat right here on campus. So, if 
the Hellenic way of life isn't for 
vou. maybe this is. (Contact the 
Gua,.dian Opinions editor for 
more details.) About frats . Why is 
getting drunk the way to have a 
good time? Doesn't anybody 
have anything to say? 

Well, that's all the AS news for 
now. Keep your shirt on until the 
next report.

Prof. Cole on US-Soviet relations 
By ANNA SEVERSON, Staff Writer 

PROFESSOR Michael Cole of lICSO's Communications and Psychology 
departments said he hopes that 
President Reagan and Mikhail 
Gorbachev will reach an 
agreement to talk again in about 
a year to work out "something 
realistic with respect to serious 
reductions of arms" since "it isn't 
clear to me that they're ready to 
do this" at their meeting in 
Geneva on November 19 and 20. 

Cole returned from the Soviet 
Union several weeks ago after 
negotiating inter-cultural 
communications and exchange 
programs for the United States, 
He has been involved with this 
official exchange and research 
between the two countries for 
over ten years, 

Cole said that the summit 
meeting is "a pure example of a 
mediated event. It's something 
we only know about through 
hearing about it. Even though we 
sort of believe that there's an 
original , we aren't there 
ourselves. and even if we were 
there , the twO leaderes JUSt go off 
by themselves with translators , 
and then what it is they reaUy 
said , we only know about by 
rumor in a mediated way." 
Mediation is the basis for 

thinking about human 
communication Cole said . 

Cole said he would be 
satisfied if Reagan and 
Gorbachev agreed to talk again 
in the future after the Geneva 
summit. "If everybody decided to 
get rid of half their weapons, 
that still leaves more than 
enough to kill us aU, Still, it's a 
movement in the right direction, 
Some little movement in the right 
direction is aU I want to see." He 
also hopes to see an increase in 
cultural exchange and 
understanding. 

Cole poimed out that he is 
not an expert on arms control, 
but he does work with what he 
calls the "potential new 
interactive media" that would 
help find solutions rather than 
cause problems in the area of 
relations between die USSR and 
the United States. "The common 
ptoblem that we share with 
people in other pans of the 
world is educational failure; new 
technology. while it is supposed 
to help, actuaUy c reates 
problems," he said, Much of 
Cole's communication research 
involves idemify ing the common 
problems of Americans and 
Russians, solving the 
communications problem, and 

reducing tension between the 
two sides, That strategy does not 
address the problem of arms 
control in any large way, he said , 
but it helps with relations. 

The way stud ems can help is 
to become concerned and inform 
themselves of what is going on 
in the world today, Cole siad, He 
believes that in order to 
understand human 
communication, students have to 
have an understanding of human 
histroy in general and know 
much about the twentieth 
cemury, Many students do not 
have such strong history 
knowledge, he said , "You just 
have to inform yourself and then 
try yourself to figure out what 
you could do such that your 
grand-children could lead a 
better life ," 

The issue of arms control 
should mean much to students, 
Cole said . "First of aU , there is 
the problem of disarmament and 
basicaUy trying to avoid a nuclear . 9 
wimer and a complete wipe-out ;f 
of humanity." he said , But the 
main question, according to Cole 
is "how do we keep from haVI ng 
this constant level of war whr re 
your people go off and are 
slaughtered for reasons that 

Cole hopes to see an increase in cultural exchange With the SOVIets. 

aren't clear? There's self-defense, 
but It'S a high price to pay for 
(going to war): 

In his many trips to the Soviet 
Union, Cole helped to establish 
educational exchange, and said 
that it is important for students 
to experience what life is like in 
another part of the world and 
how America is perceived. 
"Sitting on the inside, you seem 
to think of everyone else as a 
problem ," he said. Cole cited an 
example of misunderstanding 
between citi zens in the twO 
countries, "The ave rage person in 
Russia, such as a taxicab driver, 
find s out you're an American and 

" asks , 'wh y are you people 
~ poiming aU those rockets at us? 

.}\ And why are you trying 10 kill 
l! us?' I said: Hey, if you talked to a 
~ taxicab driver in my town, he'd 
1;- be asking you the same thing.'" j News is managed in quite a 
co. dillerent way in Russia, Cole 

playing it and they don't want to 
get the people's hopes up ," 
According to Cole , the recent 
interview of President Reagan by 
four Soviet Journalists was 
censored , but "a lot more got 
into their papers than they'd 
ever encountered before ,"

Digging for roots a birthright? 
Continued from page 1 
who I learned died at age 40, 
and a recent death of an aunt 
who died at age 35 of lung 
cancer within 2 months of its 
diagnosis. This indicates the 
insufficient nature of background 
information available to many 
adoptees through their adoption 
agencies. Most ALMA members 
are highly skeptical of any such 
informauon as it frequently 
proves to be erroneous. 

One of the traditional 
arguments against opening 
sealed adoption records to 
adoptees who have attained legal 
adult status is that it constitutes 
an invasion of the birth mother's 
privacy and violates a' promise 
made to her to protect her 
anonymity. The underlying 
assumption in such beliefs is that 
the birthmother does not want to 
meet with the child she 
relinquished. In fact, actual 
studies of birthparents indicate 
that this is not the case. 

Research conducted by the 
team of Sorosky, Baran and 
Pan nor in Los Angeles, published 
in their 1978 book The Adoption 
Triangle, found that 82 percent of 
those birthparents surveyed 
indicated a willingness to meet 
with the adoptee if he or she 
were willing. A subsequent study 
by the same group appearing in 
the September 1978 issue of 
Family Process found that 87 
percent would meet with their 
relinquished child if it were 
necessary for his or her 
emotional well-being. Other 
studies have found that as many 
as 98 percent of those 
birth parents located by the 
adoptee described the 
experience as a positive 
influence in their lives. 

The team notes that the 
majority of birthparents report 
that they suffer continuing 
feelings of loss. pain and 
mourning over the child they 
surrendered, and often they 
suffer long-term feelings of guilt 
or shame over their decision [0 
place their child up for adoption. 
Almost universally, birth parents 
report that they want the 
adoptee [0 know that they care 
for him or her. By contrast, only 
about 10 percent of the located 
birth parents react adversely to 
being found. Many 01 these 
subsequently contact the adoptee 
after the inital shock of discovery 
has passed if the caller had the 
forethought to leave a phone 
number before revealing his or 
her identity. 

My own birthmother [Old me 
that she never SlOpped thinking 
about me and she was never able 
to conceive another child which 
added to her grief. Her attempts 
to adopt a child, both privately 
and through an agency, proved 
unsuccessful. Mother's Day was 
particularly difficult for her. The 
fact that she made no real effort 
to locate me did not reflect an 
aversion to seeing me , but rather, 
it reflected the suppression of 
early 1960s society in which she 
had relinquished me. 

Sorosky, Baran and Pannor 
also discovered that a significant 
number of birth parents did not 
understand at the time of 
surrender that the protection of 
their confidentiality of 
information extended to the 
adoptee as well. In fact, when 
the birth parents were divided up 
' ''Il.O three groups according to 

when the relinquishment took 
place, in the most recent group 
the majority of birthparents who 
placed their children up for 
adoption at that time had no 
such understanding. 

Another argument is that 
searches are a rebellion against 
the adoptive parents and violate 
their rights as parents. In fact, 
the groups which are lobbying 
against laws which would open 
adoption records to adoptees of 
adult age and their birth parents, 
are groups of adopting parents 
and not birthparents. 

It is understandable that 
adopting parents react this way 

for several reasons. Sociologist 
David Kirk points out in his 
book, Shared Faie, that while 
adopting couples have been told 
by the agencies that their new 
family will be no different from a 
consanguinal family, there are in 
fact certain qualities unique to 
the adoptive family. In addition, 
several surveys conducted by 
Kirk show that SOCiety itself 
regards adoption as inferior to 
conventional child rearing. 

The adopting couple then 
copes with this discrepancy by 
either accepting the differences 
or by rejecting them. While the 
former mode of coping fosters an 

atmosphere of open discussion 
and trust between parent and 
child, the laner creates a 
distrustful relationship. Most 
adoptive parents, Kirk points out 
(who is himself an adoptive 
parent), switch between the two 
modes of coping, one being used 
more frequently than the other. 
In a rejection-of-difference home, 
the communication between the 
parents and children on the 
subject of adoption tends to be 
suppressed, the parents waiting 
for the child to ask questions 
while the child waits for the 
parents to oller information. 

Thus, the revelation that their 

child is searching for his or her 
birthparents forces the adopting 
couple to acknowledge the 
differences between their family 
relationship and that of their 
non-adopting peers. As they 
were told to expect no such 
disCrepancy, they react by 
perceiving the event as resulting 
from a failure on their part as 
parents. In addition , it triggers 
long-buried feelings regarding 
their inability to bear children 
which may be as yet unresolved, 
as adoption was and to some 
extent still is - seen by many as 
a panacea for the inabiltiy to 
produce biological offspring. 

The orgin of adoption 
practices as we know them in 
California. similar to that of most 
states, began in the mid-1930's 
when the major concern was the 
social stigma of illegitimacy 
attached [0 most adoptees who 
are placed with non-relatives. In 
those days, the word 
"illegitimate" was stamped on the 
birth certificates of children born 
out of'wedlock. Also, the social 
stigma of being an unmarried 
mother was of concern to law-
makers. Lastly, adoption agencies 
began to emerge, claiming to 
possess greater expertise in 
chOOSing appropriate families for 
relinqUished children than 
priests. doctors and lawyers, who 
handled mOst cases in those 
days. It was their opinion that 
the fact of adoption should be 
hidden from the child as he or 
she grows up to facilitate 
bonding to the new family. 

Addressing these concerns, the 
sealed record came into being. 
Originally this applied only to the 
pUblic, while the parties to the 
adoption agreement, namely the 
adoptee and both sets of parents, 
could stilI access the records. 

Though agencies in the mid-
1940s changeQ . their position 
with respe~ to informing the 
child of his or her adoption, 
they continued to lobby for 
sealing of the adoption records 
from everyone including those 
who were parry to the adoption. 
This led to an ambiguity in the 
law in California which persisted 
into the 1970s concerning 
whether or not adoptees could 
legally access their adoption 
records, as pointed out by 
Sanford N. Katz. 

California law has since been 
changed several times with 
regard to adoption, the most 
recent changes having gone into 
effect in 1984. Though the 
adoptee (and both sets of 
parents) adopted prior to that 
time has no legal right to the 
adoption records. under current 
law, those born since then will 
be able to obtain their Original, 
unahered birth certificates at age 
18. In addition , adoptees who 
are now legal adults can access 
their records, but only if waivers 
of confidentiality have been filed 
by them, the birthparent(s) who 
relinquished them and thdr 
adoptiw partnts. 

Such a law treats the adoptee 
as virtual property of the 
adoptive parents regardless of 
age. Many view this as a form of 
slavery and a violation of the 
Thirteenth Amendment of the US 
Constitution. Most adoptees 
complain that such laws and 
policies make them perpetual 
children who never enjoy the full 
legal right of adulthood. A class

Continued from ~e LO 
action suit has been filed by 
AlMA in federal court arguing 
this point and several other 
claimed violations of both the US 
and California Constitutions. 

Myopia in the law is not 
universal, as evidenced by this 
statement made by South 
Carolina's Seventh judicial 
Circuit Court Judge Wade S. 
Weatherford: 

uThe law must be consistent 
with life. It cannot and should 
not ignore broad historical 
currents of history. Mankind is 
possessed of no greater urge 
than to try to understand the age 
old questions: 'Who am I?' 
'Why am I?' When now the 
sands and ashes of continents 
are being sifted to find where we 
made our first step as man. 
Religions of mankind often 
include ancestor worship in one 
way or another. For many the 
future is blind without a sight of 
the past. Those emotions and 
anxieties that generate our thirst 
to know the past are not 
superfiCial and whimsical. They 
are real and they are "good 
cause" under the law of man and 
God. 

Meanwhile, debates in state 
legislatures over reforming these 
laws to facilitate access to 
identification information 
continue to focus on the issue of 
the birthmother's right to 
privacy. The fact that adoptees 
are bound to the terms of a 
contract to which they were 
never party, and that they have 

been stripped of their property 
rights to their identities without 
due process or just 
compensation, goes largely 
ignored . 

There is also a social problem 
faCing adoptees who attempt to 
access information which may 
lead them to their birth parents 
from sources not controlled by 
these laws, such as hospitals and 
other non-government facilities. 
Upon learning that the 
information may be used by an 
adoptee [0 locate his or her 
birth parents, record clerks 
frequently close such doors 
which are open to the general , 
non-adopted public in spite of 
the fact that such discrimination 
may be illegal. My own hospital 
records had my birthparents' 
names and addresses deleted in 
such a manner that I could not 
tell what might have been there 
previously. 

Fortunately, there are many 
sources of such information and 
with persistence, one can 
eventually stumble upon a "lucky 
break" which completes the 
search. In my case, the fact that 
my grandfather had died of 
cancer in 1959 (which the 
agency had told me) and some 
guesswork led to my obtaining 
his death certificate. The 
information it contained 
included his address at the time 
of his death, which turned out to 
be in Oakland, and his next of 
kin (my grandmother). Upon 
visiting the Oakland Public 
Library for two days and 

5ubsequently making some 
discrete phone calls, I was able 
to locate my birth mother, and 
five days after I received the 
document I was speaking to her 
on the phone.

The above data is based on a 1975 pre-

adoptees. conducted by Sorosky. Baran and 
Pannor. 

percent of the adoptees they 
studied reported that they were 
satisfied with the results of the 
meeting. About half of the 
adoptees developed meaningful 
relationships with their 
birth parents. and 32 percent 
were satisfied with periodic 
meetings. Only 8 percent 
described their relationships 
following reunion as strained, 
while 6 percent had no further 
contacts. The remainder had 
been reunited too recently to tell 
what course their relationships 
might take.

following the reunion. I have 
definitely felt more relaxed since

enormously and no longer feels 
guilty over having put her only 
child up for adoption and never 
knowing what became of that 
child. 

Open records have existed in

pamal access to original birth 
certificates (identifying 
information having been 
deleted). 

It is this author's opi nion that 
sealed records benefit no one 
and hurt rather than strengthen 
the relationship between 
adoptees and their parents. The 
notion that a law can create what 
a childhood full of love and 
nurturing has failed to produce 
is rid iculous. Pretending that the 
adoptive relationship between 
children and their parents is 
more than it is places additional 
strain on a family situation that 
already has its own unique 
problems. 

Furthermore, it must be 
recognized that there is a strong 
psychological need to know who 
one's bmhparents are , not just 
what height, weight and hair 
color were 30 years ago. 
Birthparents as well need to 
know what became of the child 
they surrendered and do not 
forget the child, but rather . 
continue to suffer from guilt and 
shame, pain and loss over the 
relinquishment. 

Attempts to facilitate reunions 
via state reun ion registries to 
place mutually willing adoptees 
and birthparents in touch with 
each mher have proven to be of 
questionable usefulness, at best. 
ALMA and other search support 
groups have tested the 
effectiveness of such reunions 
where they exist by placing 
already reunited adoptees and 
natural parents on them and 
have found that a surprisingly 
large number of these have never 
been conta£led.

Competition on an esoteric level 
By PHIL lAUDER 

academic meat shop like UCSD. 
Here competition is the essence 
of our existence. Everything is 
geared toward getting not a good 
grade, but a better grade. If you 
get back a physics test with a 
score of 78, it's meaningless until 
you know what the curve was 
and whether or not you scored 

world . As soon as your feet land 
on the grass just off the 
commencement ceremony stage, 
you are plunged into competition 
with a few billion other 
engineers, macro-economists , 
historians, chemiSts, music 
theorists and German literature 
specialists all trying for the 38 

too. Those who work the hardest 
will succeed. Those who provide 
the best product at the best price 
with the beSt quality will get the 
most business. Hard work, 
dedication, honesty, Yankee 
ingenuiry, etc., etc. - those are 
the qualities of success. 

And we all know how often it's 

more often. 
It's hard to imagine a human 

society without competition; at 
times it seems as vital to our 
survival as the blood within our 
veins. Competition is not 
restricted to human societies, not 
in the least; indeed, if we believe 
Mr. Darwin, it is the foundation 
of all life. 

"Hi, mom, I'm home." 'Tough 
day at school?" "Yeah, it was 
rough . This is Thursday, you know, 
and I went to get Ihe Guardian 10 
read 'the writer's i,' and it wasn'l 
there. Life basicallY sucked after 
that. " "Oh honey, didn't you hear? 
'the writer's i ' is moving to 
Mondays now." "Oh, how'd you 
know thaI?" " I have connections. I 
also know thai Ihis week's column 
is going to be about competition." 

"That's greal news! I Jeel belter 
now. I guess I won 'I drop out of 
school after all." "That's good, dear. 
Now come eal your dinner. I made 
you your favorite - macaroni and 
cheese, stmighl oul of the box." 
"Fantasmic - thanks, mom." 

Everything is geared toward getting not a good grade, but a 
better grade, If you get back a physics test with a score of 78, 
it's meaningless until you know what the curve was and 
whether or not you scored above the mean, 

I seem to be heading off the 
deep end with some of this stuff, 
and I realize this is a bit heavier 
than the material you usually 
count on this column to provide: 
social commentary on laundry 
and taking out the nash and that 
son of thing. My apologies. I 
must be in an esoteric moap. We 
all get in moods like this , moods 
where we all we can do IS 
consider the condition of human 
suffering or the infiniteness of 
the universe or how amazing it 

... ... ... 

C OMPEllTION is, according to some, the backbone of our society. 
I'm not sure whether that's good 
or bad; it's just the way it is. In 
our school systems, it begins on 
the first day of nursery school as 
we race onto the playground to 
try to get a tricycle before they're 
all taken. Competition gets ugly 
as soon as the first kid toSses the 
first other kid off the teeter totter 
and onto the sand because he 
wants to get on and he's bigger. 
From there it grows and 
flourishes all the way through 
grammar school and high school 
and on into college, where it full-
on blossoms, especially at an 

above the mean. All that matters 
is how much better or worse you 
did than the other guy. And 
that's the way it is . Think I'm 
being a bit cynical? Look around, 
buddy. See the guy in the tan 
shin behind you? Think he 
wasn't trying discretely to see the 
score on your test? Think again. 

Sometimes this kind of 
academic competition gets reaDy 
old reaDy fast. Many times, 
actually. When people resort to 
calling in bomb scares because 
they're not prepared for their 
final just yet, that's what I call 
getting really old. 

Of course, competition doesn't 
get any sweeter OUt in the real 

jobs in the Western United 
States that are within their 
specialty. Most of us solve the 
problem of competing for jobs 
within our field of specialization 
by giving up on our field of 
specialization and going into 
some totally different ... and 
sometimes bizarre ... field of 
employment - Bible selling, 
yacht racing, tuna fishing, 
working on the chain gang, that 
SOrt of thing. This is particularly 
prevalent among majors in the 
fields of sociology and history 
and 18th century urban culture 
and development. 

The basic premise of 
competition sounds so lovely, 

like that, which is nOl very. It is 
a pleasure to see a business built 
on such a wonderful foundation ; 
they are around, and they do 
succeed, but not all the time. It is 
also a pleasure to see a dishonest 
organization, an organization 
built on premises of sleeziness 
and half-truths and generally 
bad-faith business practices, split 
down the middle and crumble 
like so many shanties in a 
Mexican earthquake . It gives you 
the feeling that Batman and Robin 
wasn't pure fiction, that the good 
guys do win once in a while and 
the bad guys do get theirs in the 
end. 

Would that 'twere like that 

is that with every breath the 21% 
of the air that is oxygen is 
absorbed through our lungs and 
into our bloodstream so it can be 
pumped throughout our body 
and return to our lungs as the 
waste product carbon dioxide 
that can be expelled just in time 
for the next breath to be taken. 
Amazing stuff. Amazing how long 
that sentence was, too . 

Next time I get in one of these 
moods, I'll warn you first. Good 
bye for now. See you next 
Monday, competition willing. ~

Two headers 
By JOHN SCHACHT, sports Editor 

T HE HEX IS DEAD and buried out on Warren Field. Stake right through 
the heart. Si Iver bullets between 
the cross-bars. "Excorsised," as 
Men's soccer coach Derek 
Annstrong put it. 

With a flick of his head, 
freshman Robert Patterson laid to 
rest the Claremont jinx with a 
header past the tag goahe to 
give UCSD a 2-1 victory and the 
right to play in the quarter-finals 
versus last year's champs # 1 
Wheaton. 

better than one 

Using rwo headers - the first 
from senior Phil Kenney - and 
a tenacious defense led by goalie 
Albeno Gomez, the Tritons 
advanced past the team that has 
kept them out of the NCAA flna; 
rounds each of the last rwo 
years. In front of 1500 people -
and maybe twice as many in a 
Warren apartment balcony -
UCSD scored first at the 10 
minute mark when Kenney 
headed in a comer shOt from 
Th,en Nguyen. 

The: Tritons are celebrating their defeat of Claremont and Colorado College. 

But C1arl!mom stole the 
momentum right back when the 
Tritons failed on their knockout 
of Claremont's long throw and 
Eric Themm headed one past 
Gomez at the 7:50 mark "It was 
a bit unnerving," said Annsrrong, 
"that's the same kmd of goal they 
scored on us in the first game," 
(a 2-1 loss at Claremont). "Every 
goal the other team scores 
against you you feel as though its 
your fault ," said Gomez. "and we 
could have defended that one 
better. But Derek emphasized 
dlsclphne at the half and we 
played well on those the rest of 

the game." 
The Tritons came out in the 

second half knowing - as 
Gomez put it - that "wlthm 
ourselves we could do it." At the 
29'30 mark In the second half 
forward Greg Schwarz crossed a 
perfect baU in front of the net 
that Patterson knocked in to 
provide the Tritons with the 
winning margin . "It really felt 
great," Parrerson said of his shot, 
"Greg gave me a perfect ball to 
hit past hIm." 

At th,S point the Stags 
immedIately increased their 
pressure in order to get the 
equahzer. Time after time the 
Stags turned penalry kicks into 
goal opportunmes only to have 
the ball cleared by the defense . 
Gomez got into the act with twO 
marvelous one-handed saves in 

notes: 1 lit Trilons are into run a host oj 
injuries. After gttting clobbered by on Wt:dnesday night, 15-7, 
9-15,11-15,4-15, the women spihtrs wt:nt on to a great come-from-
behind victory against Dominguez Hills, 10-15, 9-15, 15-11, 16-14 and 
15-2. 

With a record of 26-12, UCSD is ranked 10th in Division Uf. The 
Tritons have a home game against Air Force this Fridtly at 7:30 at tht: 
gym. 

·"" 

from of the box. 'This game was 
the highlight of my college 
career," said the senior, "this was 
sweet revenge." The Stags sought 
to mcrease' the pressure even 
more at the IO mmute mark by 
moving one of their defensemen 
up into the front line, but the 
strategy almost backfired as the 
Tritons had several breakaway 
opportunities thwaned only by 
some good goaltending by the 
Stag goalie . 

The Tritons advanced into the 
regIOnal championship by 
beating Colorado College in a 
sloppy game marred by an 
ejection of a CC player and a 
plethora of yellow cards. The 
Stage advanced by systematically 
beating St. Thomas 2-0 on 
Friday. 

UCSD now plays last year's 
DIvision III winner Wheaton at a 
site yet to be determined. Given 
the good attendance at frigid 
Friday's and Sunday'~ matches 

Defender Paul Carlson anchors 
the "D." 

Armstrong is hoping that the 
powers-that-be will choose UCSD 
[or the next host site . "The 
crowd was really tremendous," he 
said, "it's one thing to play well 
in front of no one. The support 
from the fans really makes it 
worthwhile. It's so much more 
emotional ; and that's what the 
game is all about, emotions." 

Robert Patterson, Sunday's 
hero in a team effon, is 
optimistic. "If we play this way," 
he said, "I'm looking forward to 
playing anyone - I'll think we 
can take it aU ." At least they 
won't have to face their nemesis 
Claremont anymore. That's' one 
nightmare that's been put to 
rest. 1m

T HE WOMEN'S soccer team traveled to Occidental for their last game of 

the season with two aims in 
mind. To finish with their first 
.500 record, and to maintain 
their unblemished record against 
Division m opponents. 

Occidental proved to be alar 
tougher opponent than any of 
the other Division m schools the 
Tritons had played during the 
year, and although UCSD 
dominated the first half they 
could not penetrate a well-
organized Oxy defense. 

Coach John Leaney brought 
on substitute Lynn Bailey (the 
Tritons' leading scorer) in a bid 
to break a deadlock. Once on 
the field ,Bailey immediately hit 
the crossbar with a rocket shot 
Early in the second half, Bailey 
rewarded her coach's confidence 
with another fierce shot which 
hit the back of the net for her 
eighth goal of the season. 

This was all the Tritons would 
need as Chris Ladish went on a 
fine solo-run that resulted in 
UCSD's second goal. Adrienne 
Clark and Ladish added two 
more goals before Clark finished 
the season with the Triton's 53rd 
goal and probably the best of the 
lot. Ladisn beat her defender and 
crossed the ball to Clark who hit 
a lunging header into the far 
comer of the net for her 
eighteenth goal of the year - a 

new Triton record. 
The win against Occidental 

finished the most successful 
soccer season ever for the 
Tritons. Their record of 10-10-2 
is all the more impressive 
because they began the season 
with four straight losses. The 
Triton's goal record of 53-32 
demonstrates their improvement 
in their forward play. After 
conceding 12 goals in their first 
four games, the inexperienced 
defense learned with every game. 
"Their ability to withstand long 
spells of pressure against tough 
teams," said their coach, 
"enabled the team to compete 
against anybody." 

'Even some of the Tritons' 
losses exemplify the long 
distance the club has come in 
Leaney's two short years. Losses 
against nationaUy ranked Long 
Beach (1-0), Dominguez Hills (2-
1) and UCSB (1-0) - all in the 
top ten in the far west region -
showed that the Tritons were 
competitive in nearly all of their 
matches. 

Perhaps the most encouraging 
facet of the women's year was 
the Triton's dominant record 
against Division m foes. They 
were 6-0 with a goals record of 
35-2. With a repeat perlormance 
next year the Tritons will be 
cenain contenders for regional 
playoffs in the new Division Ul 
National Championship. ~

SPORTS 

W1 RI; Tn WI R:;;I ~~~ 
This wuk 's column is dedicated to Basketball, which, as 

every true sports buff knows, is the onlY sport that rt:ally 
matters. This year may see a changing of the guard as some of 
the teams like Houston and Cleveland attempt to crack the 
Laker-Celtic party. Good luck, gentleman. 
The Wctt LOs Angdt:s: The Lakers went out and 
strengthened themselves by aquiring Marice Lucas' 
muscle during the off-season. In addition, their first 
round draft choice, A.c. Green, is a worthy play-alike, 
and that's just what the rest of the NBA teams need -
another sky-walker to contend with. If Kareem gets 
hurt, the Lakers will only win the division by five 
games. 
Golden State: Yes, that's right. the Warriors. The best of the 
rest. With the return of paisano Joe Barry Carroll and 
Purvis Short's 30 a game, the Warriors will score a lot of 
points. But the driving force behind the Warriors will be 
rookie Chris Mullin. With the drive, desire and coun 
presence of Larry Bird, MuOin reminds us of well, Larry 
Bird. Sleepy Floyd averages 17.5 from backcoun. There is 
no bench. 
Portland: Sam Bowie has a year under his belt and the 
seven footer is expected to do some seven foot thin~ for 
the Blazers. But tte cannot lead the trail to the promised 
land any more than Clyde "the glide" Drexler can, their 
only other name player. Paxson and Carr comprise the 
bench. 
San "Los Angeles" Diego: There are two reasons why the 
Clippers can't go further. One is no-D Donaldson. Sports 
lIlustrated caBed the third man taken in the draft the "dog 
of the draft." Stick to swimsuit issues, guys. Benoit 
Benjamin comes from Creighton, where Willis Reed 
teaches his players how to play D. Benjamin is awkward 
on the offensive side but will soon be starting. The 
OiPDI"T'!i have the NM's best kept secret in Derek "the 
rock" Smith, who can slam with anyone in the league and 
averaged 26 a game last year. The other reason is Phil 
Stone does play by play telecasts. Gag. 

Phom~:. Lany Nance and Walter Davis do not a team 
make. John McCloud is a good coach, but Houdini 
couldn't escape this predicarnenL Villanova's Ed Pinckney 
had a d iSlppoinnng pre-season, and It's doubtful the Suns 
could even get Ed back to the final four. 
Seaule: "Super" Sonies my foot. Who are these guys? Xavier 
McDaniel may tum out to be a player, but the Sonies 

backcourt doesn't exist and the fromcourt ain't much to 
• write home about either. What does that leave , the bench? 

No it doesn't. 
the MidW!!st Houston: If the Rockets do not win this 
division, it won't be because of lack of talent. Ralph 
Sampson and Akeem Olajuwon will be the superstars, 
Lewis Uoyd is a bonafide aD star forward , and the 
possible addition of Norm Nixon makes the potential 
on this team fearsome. Coach Bill Fitch's lunch bucket 
style of baskerbaD might have worked with his old 
team in Boston, but if he doesn't let the Rockets take 
off, look for a coaching change. 
Denver: Before their game with the Lakers on Friday, the 
Nuggets were stunning the baskerbaD world by actually 
using defense in their game plan, evidenced by a game 
withAt1anta where they held the Hawks to 73 points. "This 
has got to StOp," said head coach Doug Moe, "We don't 
want to mess up our reputation." Things went back to 
normal as the Ulkers thrashed the Nuggt'ts 128-99, but the 
Nuggets will be a strong team if they can find the "D" in 
Denver. 
Dallas: The Mavericks have some great forwards - Mark 
Aguirre. Sam Perkins, and Dedef Schrempf - but without 
a center, spring football will still be the number one sport 
in Dallas come NBA playoff time. 
Utah: Frank Layden, the ever expanding coach of theJazz, 
has the prolific Adrian Dandey surrounded by a team 
"Layden" with fodder like John Stockton and Les Hansen. 
unless Karl "The Mailman" Malone begins to deliver first 
class, the playoffs will pass by the Salt Palace. 
San Antonio "Lynch 'em!" and "String 'em up!" were the 
cries of a posse of Spurs' fans when Coach Conon 
Fitzsimmons traded the beloved "Ice Man". George Gervin 
to the Chicago BuDs. Mike MitcheD and Alvin Robertson 
are quality pla~rs, but it all depends on the performance 
of the goateed Anis Gilmore at center. And he ain't getting 
younger. 
Sacramento: When many of the players learned of the 
team's move to Sacramento, they expressed delight that 
they were going to California. Reggie Theus, a native of Los 
Angeles, set his teammalrs straight "Sacramento," Theus 
said to the unknowing players, "is not California: Same 
players, same name, same team, same coach equals same 
resuhs 
The East Boston: The question in Boston is not whether 
Lam Bird will recover completely from nagging elbow 

and back injuries or if the Celtics will repeat as NBA 
finalists. The real issue scathing the minds of NBA fans 
across the country is who thought that black shoes 
would look better than the lovely green ones that used 
to shod Celtie feet? Incredibly, black looks worse. 
New Jersey: Many say the only good thing about NewJersey 
are the Nets. They are the only professional team that plays 
their home games in New Jersey and are not ashamed to 
admit it. (The footbaD Jets and Giants play in Jersey, but 
profess to be from - wink, wink - New .York.) The 
ingredients for a strong team are there, throw m the Laker 
inOuenced offense of new coach, Dave Wohl and the 
result is a team that could knock the Celties out of their 
little black boots. 
Philadelphia: Charles Barkely, the NBA's "Refrigerator" and 
Moses Malone - "the Chairman of the Boards" -
provide a good foundation up front, but the aging Doct.or, 
Julius Erving, will probaby be out by next year and Maunce 
Cheeks has also seen better years. Andrew Toney is out 
with an ankle injury. The Sixers have third place locked 
up. 
New York: Patrick Ewing was to be the savior of Knick 
basketbaU. But the Knicks need a couple more saviors 
because they have already lost their first seven games and 
19 in a row dating back to last year. Without Bernard King, 
Ewing can play like the second coming of Kareem and it 
won't make a difference. The man is alone. 
Wahington: Gus Williams is still a dazzling guard , but now 
there is only one "Bruise Brother", Jeff Ruland , and with 
the talent on the rest of the team being marginal, 
Georgetown would be a better NBA entry in this division. 
Last place. 
The Central Milwaukee: Moncrief and Cummings, two 
reasons why the Bucks will win the division. Centers 
Alton Lister and Paul Mokeski, rwo reasons why they 
won't go any further. Paul Pressy is a talent and Ricky 
Pierce fiDs it up off the bench. Don Nelson coaches 
with mirrors. 
Detroit: One prolonged injury to a staner, one more fist 
fight betWeen Tripuka's and Thomas' egos and the Pistons 
may blow a gasket. Bill Lambier always brings his lunch 
bucket to play, but sometimes he shoots it, too. 
C1tvelarni: The Cays are out to prove it wasn't a fluke. 
World can still fiJI it and has become a leader on the coun. 
Roy Hmson is a rising star, and Tohn Ba~ley is an

H20-Polo 
begins Div. 
III stretch 
By DAVID TEDROW. Staff Writtr 

ALTHOUGH ITS just begun, November has already been a long 
month for the men's water polo 
team. In the first 72 hours of this 
momh, the team lost a total of 
five games in a row. All five of 
these losses came to teams 
ranked in the top ten of the 
nation's division I teams. The 
last four of these losses came in 
the Long Beach Tournament last 
weekend. 

UCSD staned the tourney 
against UC Santa Baroara on 
Saturday morning. San Diego has 
had a history of playing poorly 
against Santa Saroara, and they 
li.ved up to this reputation 
Saturday by losing 13-6. Later 
that same day, San Diego fell to 
Fresno State 10-7. A poor first 
half of play by the Tritons saw 
them trailing 7-1 early in the 
third quaner, but UCSD 
managed to rally back and get as 
close as 7-5 before losing. This 
mini-rally by San Diego was 
impressive because , "It came 
against Fresno's first string," said 
coach Denny Harper, "It wouldn't 
be too great if we just scored a 
couple of goals against their 
scrubs, but they felt they had to 
play their staners the entire 
game to beat us." 

UCSD played probably their 
best game of the tourney on 
Sunday, but still lost to host Cal 
State Long Beach, 9-5. The 
Tritons featured a stingy defense , 
but against these division I 
powerhouses, San Diego doesn't 
have the size .to score on all their 

"We plan on hilling 
the rest oj the teams 
we play." 

-Larry Saunders 

man-up situations, nor do they 
have the speed to prevent 
numerous counter-anack goals by 
the quicker teams. Thus, for the 
founh time in two days, UCSD 
lost, this time to UCI 9-3. 

In order to improve, the 
players want to learn something 
from each defeat. In the Irvine 
game, Jeff Smith learned that 
you're not allowed to bark at the 
other team in water polo. During 
this game, a ua player was 
awarded a free shot from four 
meters out. Smith , in an attempt 
to distract him. began barking at 
the guy. The referee, obviously a 
cat ·lover, took offense to Smith's 
barrage and tossed him out of 
the game. Coach Harper tried to 
explain that Smith had "a 

ne~us hyperkinetic disorder" 
but he was barking up the wrong 
nee as the ref held firm in his 
decisjpn. 

With the toughest pan of the 
season behind them, the team 
can now concentrate on winning 
again. Their goal is to win the 
remaining seven games of their 
season convincingly. How can a 
team which has lost its last six 
games expect to win seven in a 
row? They qUit playing top ten 
division I teams, and stan 
playing teams on an equal level. 
Can losing six games in a row 
possibly help a team? "The 
experience we've gained from 
playing such physical teams will 
help us," explains Larry Sanders, 
·We know we are a good team 
and we plan on killing the rest 
of the teams we play. We're 
hungry for a win, and we want 
to put the hurt on the other team 
for a change: ~

Fencers undefeated UCSD Fencing Results vs. W1 Rk To WI Rh~~ 
CSU Fullerton and Cal Tech 

By VALERIE GULICK 

U CSDs men's fencing team has won all four matches overall 
(against SDSU. Cal Poly Pomona, 
CSUF, and Cal Tech), for the 
season. Each of the three teams 
has turned in excellent results in 
their evems, the epee team is 
undefeated. 

The foil team droped its first 
match of the season by a close 
margin , but has since raUied 
back, and on Saturday swept 
both Cal State Fullenon and Cal 

Tech, losing only one bout out of 
nine to each. 

The sabre team has three wins 
to its credit and only one loss by 
a one-bout margin. 

The women's foil team 
maintains a 2-2 record, which is 
not bad conSidering that they 
come from beginning fencing 
classes!! This weekend, the 
UCSD fencing team will go north 
to compete against UC Santa 
Barbara and Occidental College 
at UCsB.
