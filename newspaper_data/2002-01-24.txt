Students flock to CIA, technology 
booth at job fair on Library Walk 
Slow economy results in low company turnout, but an 
increase is expected in time for next fall's job fair 
By JUN MA 
Staff Writer 

The Central Intelligence 
Agency joined corporate, military 
and government representatives 
Jan. 23 for the Winter Job Fair, 
which took place on Library 
Walk. 

The CIA, created in 1947, is 
the country's leading intelligence 
gathering organization. 
Recruiters were looldng for col-
lege students who are interested 
in careers such as the clandestine 
services, science and engineering 
technologies, analytical positions, 
language translation and other 
professional positions within the 
organization. 

Recruiting at universities is a 
common practice for the CIA. Its 
national recruiting organization 

visits 70 to 80 campuses regionally 
on a regular basis. Its main goal is 
to attract interest toward entry-
level positions, 

"Sixty percent of those hired 
are entry-level," said West Coast 
Recruiting Officer Michael Mau. 
"This means that they have been 
out of college for two years or 
less." 

The CIA offers three pro-
grams for students considering a 
career in the intelligence field. 
These programs include an' 
undergraduate student trainee 
(co-op) program, an internship 
program and a graduate studies 
program. 

"Younger people want to start 
their careers after college," said

UC Board of 
Regents pass a.n 
response to AB 540 
Illegal immigrants, non -California 
residents can now get in-state tuition 
LAURA McGANN 
Staff Writer 

A new tuition exemption pro-
gram will be enacted by the UC 
Board of Regents to allow some 
illegal immigrants and nonresident 
students to pay in-stat'~ fees if they 
attended a California high school 
for at least three year and graduat-
ed. 

The UC Regents conditionally 
passed the exemption at a board 
uleerlng Jan. 16. 

The exemption was passed to 
align the UC system with the 
California State University and 
community college policy that was 
established by A.ssembly Bill 540 
last October. 

AB 540, signed by Gov. Gray 
Davis, exempts students from pay-
ing out-of-state fees if they attend-
ed a California high school for 
three years, graduated from a 
California high school and are cur-
rently fi ling affidavits stating that 
they will file, or have filed , an 
application to legal ize their immi-
gration status. 

State Assemblyman Marco 
Firebaugh, a Democrat from Los 

Angeles, sponsored AB 540 fol-
lowing a decade -long struggl e 
between immigrant student 3(,,"0--
cacy grotlps and the tate o f 
California. 

During the 19805 illegal immi -
grant students were all owed to 
attend California's public coll eges 
and universities if they could 
demonstrate that they met the 
same residency requirements :IS 
nonimmigrant snldents. 

This policy changed in 199 1 
when a UC registrar employee 
sued the University of California 
after he was fired for not upholding 
the Leticia A order, which granted 
undocumented students the fi ght 
to pay in-state fees. 

The law uit caused newl y 
enrolled, undocumented students 
to pay out-of-state fees. 

AB 540 will allow immigrant 
students, who make up less than 
half of one percent of California's 
total university and college enroll-
ment, to once again be all owed to 
pay in-state fees if they meet the 
new residency requirements. 

T he exemption is estimated to

ERe goes to the polls 
for $5 student fee hike 
Additional funds would only be used for 
ERe operated student programing 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students of E leanor Roosevelt 
College will go to the polls this 
week to vote on a fee referendum 
that would increase their student 
tuition by $5 per quarter. 

The increased funds would be 
used for ERC student program-
ming, according to Student 
Council Chair David Goodwin, 
who sent an e-mail to all ERC stu-
dents. 

"The money raised by this fee 
would come straight to ERC under 
the direct control of students," 
Goodwin said. 

The referendum has the support 
of the ERC dean's office. 

"We are supportive of it, but 
none of the funds will go to the 
dean's office," said Patricia Scott, 
dean of student affairs at ERe. 
"The intent is to develop program-
ming and events that will be attrac-
tive to all students of ERe." 

ne reason for the increa e in 
funding is to make ERC' events 

more competitive with those of 
other colleges that have more snl-
dents and more money for events. 

"The funds that were allotted 
from [the A.S. Council] don't all ow 
us to put on the activities for ERC 
sntdents that other coll eges can, 
such as Muirstock, the Muir 40 and 
the Revell e Watermelon Drop," 
said Crystal Fecht, the programcr 
for Student Council. "Both Muir 
and Revelle have activity fees." 

ERC is the smallest college on 
the UCSD campus, and is therefore 
allotted the least amount of moncy 
by the A.S. Council, which allots 
fund based on enrollment. Fecht 
said that although this is a reasonable 
system, it leaves ERC short on fund -
ing for student activities. 

"Because it is a small college, we 
get pretty good turnouts, so we end 
up paying just as much as other col -
leges [for OUf events)," Fecht said . 

cott also recognizes the need for 
ERC to raise funds to have events 
that arc ftm for the students.

Jobs: 
Fair chance to make 
good first impressions 
Continued from page 1 
Assistant Recruiter Jan ice 
Broder. "The ClA is a good place 
for that." 

Recently, the amount of appli -
cants and resumes has increased 
dramaticall y. T his growth in 
national interest can be linked to 
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, 
according to Broder. 

"A lot of people have applied 
due to the attacks," Broder said, 
"We 've recei ved cover letters 
from applicants saying that they 
feel like they need to do some-
thing or make a difference, 
whether it's secretariat or clandes-
tine." 

Some UCSD students share 
this patriotic sentiment and have 
considered the CIA as a part of 
their future. 

"A job at the CIA has definitely 
been a possibility," said senior 
Matt Diebolt, who is interested in 
becoming a biochemist for the 
chemical warfare deparunent of 
the counterterrorist unir. "The 
events of Sept. 11 have certainly 
driven me to pursue a career in the 
CIA." 

Other students see the terrorist 
attacks and the influx of attention 
that the CIA has been receiving 
recently as an opportunity. 

"[The CIA) has been some-
thing ('ve considered since high 
school , II said senior Stefanie 
Ness. "Due to the events of Sept. 
II , the number of positions open 
to new applicants has increased, 
and I feel like now is the best time 
to apply." 

The Sept. II terrorist attacks 
seem to have changed the mind -

sets of many Americans about 
agencies such as the CIA and FBI, 
and departments such as the 
police, fire and emergency medical 
technicians. Careers in these fields 
may seem more plausible as the 
popularity of government agencies 
has increased. 

"You don't get as many strange 
looks from family members when 
you tell them that you 're going 
into bioterrorislll ," Ness said . 
"YOII probably would before Sept. 
II." 

However, despi te the terrorist 
attacks, a majority of students 
interested in careers in the CIA 
have not been dramatically influ-
enced by the events. 

"It has nothing to do with 9-
II ," Adel Hajrasu said. "Because 
of my background and the travel-
ing I've done, the CIA is some-

'The events of 
Sept. 11 have 

certainly driven 
me to pursue a 

career in the 
CIA:

UCSD student 

thing I would be able to do. It 
seems like a challenging career." 

Representatives from over 60 
companies were also on hand to 
recruit UCSD students to their 
ranks of the work force. 

According to UCSD Career 
Center Employer Relations 
Coordinator Adele Wilson , the 
weak economy has resulted in the 
lowest turnout among companies 
seeking employees at a UCSD job 
fair in recent years. 

Many students, such as

Lyon Ue:N/Gucrdian 

Future spook: Revelle senior Shadi Elabdallah speaks to CLA. reau~er Michael J. 
Mau aboUt job descriptions at the CIA during yesterday's job fair held on ubary Walk. 
Revelle senior Matt Delmage, 
who waited in a long line to meet 
with a Qualcomm recruiter, 
remained optimistic about land-
ing a job in today's slower job 
market. 

"I'm concerned but not wor-
ried," Delmage said. "I'll get a job, 
but it's not the same as three years 
ago." 

Rarely do students get hired at 
the job fair. Mostly, it is ·a chance 
to make Q first impression with a 
company, Wilson said. 

Dale Tattersall, of Southland 
Industries, an engineering and 
construction company, agreed. 

"We're here taking resumes, 
introducing our company to stu-
dents and getting to know stu-
dents." Tattersall said. "Then we 
will review the resumes and con-
tact potential candid3tes." 

Making first impress.ions is why 
Chris Byrne of the Men's 
\¥herehouse attended the job fair. 
Aside from looking for potential 
salespeople, Byrne dispensed 

advice on how dressing for success 
is more than a cliche, 

" ~irst impressions are impor-
tant," he said. "They show that 
you are a serious candidate. 
Dressing right is a part of that." 

Josh Barnes, a Revelle senior, 
was out scouting technology com-
panies. 

"I'm trying to find out what 
they are hiring for and get a pic-
ture of how to prepare mysel f for 
when I graduate," Barnes said. 

Although the economy is start-
ing to pick up, recruiters still 
stayed away. 

"Biotech companies are real 
popular and that industry is 
going great guns right now," 
Wilson said . " It's really hot right 
now." 

Wilson said that hiring usual -
ly lags a few months behind an 
economic rebound. She antici-
pates a better turnout of 
recruiters for the Spring Job Fair 
and a full rebound by next fall's 
fair, at the latest.

Tuition: 
Effect on UC stystem 
still remains unclear 
Continued from page 1 
affect between 200 and 390 cur-
ren tly enrolled snldent~ in all the 
UC campuses, 375 full-time , tu-
dC ll ts at community collc!;cs and S) 
freshma n studen ts in thc CS U ~y,­
tem. 

It is undear at tilis time hOI\" 
many new students will he affected 
at the UC level. 

"We will not know how many 
more students will be affected until 
further in the future - presumably 
a few hundred ," said UC Regent 
spokesman Trey Davis. 

It is expected that additional eli -
gible students will enroll because of 
the lower cost. 

The University of California 
estimates the cost of the program 
to be between $2 .3 milli o n and 
$4.4 million - depending on the 
number of s tudents who take 
advantage of it - at the UC level 
alone . 

The UC Regents contend that 
the exemption's intention is not to 
provide easier access to educa tion 
for illegal immigrants or minori-
ties. 

"This exemption is simply a 
matter of fairness for a fairly small 
number of students who have been 
a part of the California school sys-
tem, not to increase diversity," 
Davis said. 

The University of California 
has voted to adopt the exemption 
pending the enactment of furth er 
legislation that would limit UC lia-
bility should AB 540 be succe~s ful ­
Iy challenged in the courts. 

Provisions fo r the exemption 
should be in pl ace no later than 
January 2003.

Jobs: 
Fair chance to make 
good first impressions 
Continued from page 1 
Assista n t Recrui te r Janice 
Broder, "The CIA is a good place 
for that ," 

Recently, the amount of appli -
ca nts and resumes has increased 
dramatically. This growth in 
national interest can be linked to 
the Sept. t I terrorist attacks, 
according to Broder, 

"A lot of people have applied 
due to the attacks," Broder said. 
"We've received cover letters 
from applicants saying that they 
feel like they need to do some-
thing or make a difference, 
whether it's secretariat or clandes-
tine.'t 

Some UCSD students share 
this patriotic sentiment and have 
considered the CIA as a part of 
their future. 

"A job at the CIA has definitely 
been a possibility," said senior 
Matt Diebolt, who is interested in 
becoming a biochemist for the 
chemical warfare department of 
the counterterrorist uni t. "The 
events of Sept. II have certainly 
driven me to pursue a career in the 
CIA." 

Other students see the terrorist 
attacks and the influx of anention 
that the CIA has been receiving 
recently as an opportunity. 

"[The CIA) has been some-
thing I've considered since high 
school, " said senior Stefanie 
Ness ... Due to the even ts of Sept. 
II , the number of positions open 
to new applicants has increased, 
and I feel like now is the best time 
to apply." 

The Sept. II terrorist anacks 
seem to have changed the mind-

sets of m any Americans about 
agencies sllch as the CIA and FBI, 
and departments such as the 
police, fire and emergency medical 
technicians. Careers in these fields 
may seem more plausible as the 
popularity of government agencies 
has increased, 

"You don't get as many strange 
looks from fami ly members when 
you tell tllelll that you're going 
into bioterrorisl11," Ness said . 
"YOlt probably would before Sept. 
11. " 

However, despite the terrorist 
attacks, a majority of students 
interested in careers in the CIA 
have not been dramatically influ-
enced by the events , 

"It has nothing to do with 9-
II," Adel Hajrasu said, "Because 
of my background and the travel-
ing I've done, the CIA is some-

'The events of 
Sept. 11 have 

certainly driven 
me to pursue a 

career in the

thing I would be able to do. It 
seems like a challenging career." 

Representatives from over 60 
companies were also on hand to 
recruit UCSD students to their 
ranks of the work force. 

According to UCSD Career 
Center E mployer Relations 
Coordinator Adele Wilson, the 
weak economy has resulted in the 
lowest turnout among companies 
seeking employees at a UCSD job 
fair in recent years. 

Many students, such as

Future spook: Revelle senior Shadi ElabdalIah speaks to CIA recruiter Michael 1. 
Mau aboUt job descriptions at the CIA during yesterday's job fair held on Libary Walk. 
Revelle senior Matt Delmage, 
who waited in a long line to meet 
with a Qualcomm recruiter, 
remained optimistic about land-
ing a job in today's slower job 
market. 

"I'm concerned but not wor-
ried," Delmage said. "I'll get a job, 
but it's not the same as three years 
ago," 

Rarely do students get hired at 
the job fair. Mostly, it is ·a chance 
to make a first impression with a 
company, Wilson said. 

Dale Tattersall, of Southland 
Industries, an engineering and 
construction company, agreed. 

"We're here taking resumes, 
introducing our company to stu-
dents and getting to know stu-
dents." Tanersall said. "Then we 
will review the resumes and con-
tact potential candidates." 

Making first impressions is why 
Chris Byrne of the Men's 
Wherehouse attended the job fair. 
Aside from looking for poten tia l 
saJespeople, Byrne dispensed 

advice on how dressing for success 
is more than a cliche. 

"J;irst impressions are impor-
tant," he said. "They show that 
you are a serious candidate . 
Dressi ng right is a part of that." 

Josh Barnes, a Revelle senior, 
was out scouting technology com-
panies, 

"I'm trying to find out what 
they are hiring for and get a pic-
ture of how to prepare myself for 
when I graduate," Barnes said, 

Although the economy is start-
ing to pick up, recruiters still 
stayed away. 

"Biotech companies are real 
popular and that industry is 
going great guns right now," 
Wilson said . "It's really hot right 
now." 

Wilson sa id that hiring usual-
ly lags a few months behind an 
economic rebound, She antici-
pates a better turnout of 
recruiters fo r the Spring J ob Fair 
an d a fu ll rebound by next fall's 
fai r, at the latest.

It is expected that additional cli-

the lower cost. 

The University of California 
estimates the cost of the program 
to be between $2 ,3 million and 
$4.4 million - depending on the 
number of students who take 
advantage of it - at the UC leve l

The UC Regents contend that 
the exemptions intention is not to 
provide easier access to education 
for illegal immigrants or minori-
ties. 

"This exemption is simply a 
matter of fairness for a fairly small 
number of students who have been

Davis said.

Students can't 
afford to fund 
faculty raises 

U ni ve rsi ty officials announced la t 
week at the UC Regents meeting that they 
may raise tuition to ensure annual salary 
raises, which keep professors' income 
competitive and help attract and retain 
high-quality lecturers. The announce-
ment came in response to the tightened 
budget Gov. Gray Davis submined two 
weeks ago. 

In the budget, Davis del)ied the regents' 
requested $125 million, granting only 
$44.8 million for rnerit increases of 1.5 
percent for qualifi ed professor and staff, 
and opting to allocate $64 million toward 
enrolling 7, 100 full-time students over the 
next year. 

TI~e Guordian applauds Davis' move 
and believes that Davis clearly has 
California students ' interests in mind. 

Some of the mo t de erving faculty and 
staff will still receive raises - they just 
won't be the across-the-board increases 
the regents requested. It is unlikely that 
the university will lose a significant num-
ber of current or potential employees in 
these hard times because of a half-percent 
cut to the raises. However, it is certain that 
the UC system will lose those 7,100 stu-
dents forever if the money for enrollment 
growth is not allotted. These students will 
not wait a year or two to attend a UC 
school; they wi ll enroll elsewhere. Davis 
has put the money where it wi ll accom-
plish the most right now and in the futu re. 

However, the Guardian vehemently 
opposes the regents' consideration of 
passing the financial buck to UC students 
to pacify UC professors: 

Without the raises - which some fac-
ulty and staff would receive, but at a lesser 
rate and for a limited period - professors 
would experience no actual financial hard-
hip. However, a tuition hike would hurt 

students, who draw meager incomes to 
begin with and are further affected by the 
slowing economy. For some students, a 
tuition increase would mean the differ-
ence between being able to attend a UC 
school and not being able to. We at the 
Guardian doubt that UC employees would 
face such a crisis. 

Any tuition increases should go directly 
to improving the individual student's edu-
ca tional experience. This is especia lly 
important because the University of 
California is enrolling far more students 
than it ever has before - making college 
li:e more difficult than it has been in pre-
VIOU years. 

In summary, if the regents insist on 
annllal increa es across the board, they 
should consider other funding source 
than their al ready-strapped students' wal-
let.

"BANKRUPT EH? LET ME SHOW YO(J OUYS A LITTLE TRICK THAT WORKED FOR (JS! " 

Alllerica tnllSt confront tnistakes 
made in the war against terrorism 
Nation's protracted involvement in the Middle 

East poses many challenges for the future 
By SUSAN FORE 
Contributing Wri ter 

Recently, Yahoo News published an 
article on the crash of a marine plane in 
Afghanistan . Seven marines, aged 21 to 
37, died when their plane mysteriously 
coll ided with a mountain while attempt-
ing to land at Shamsi, Pakistan, around 
25 miles northeast of Panjur, Pakistan. 

The marines were based in Miramar, 
Calif., making the tragedy hit a bit clos-
er to home for some of us. Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfetd, in his 
down-to-earth way, was quoted as say-
ing, "It just breaks your heart," 

President Bush commented as well, 
mentioning the prayers offered to the 
families of the mari nes, but he also con-
cluded tha t the cause we are now 
engaged in is just and noble. The cause is 
freedom and this nation will not rest 
until it has achieved its objective. 

However touching this may be to 
those discon nected to the wars raging in 
the world today, no cause can be noble 
and just when it costs the lives of so 
many others along the way. The dea th 
toll is still being tallied for the World 
Trade Center catastrophe, and so far it 
has reached nearly 3,000. 

Bush seems to have a major grudge 
about this, and ri ghtly so. Nevertheless, 
the retaliation against the infamous 
Taliban force s has brought more 
sketchy situa tio ns than soluti ons. 
There have been more than 200 deaths 
directly related to explo ions, gunfire 
and raids in Afghanistan, the li st con-
sisting of civi lians as well as fighting 
forces . The United States consistently 
backs itself up with reasonable suspi -
cio n regarding the whereabouts of 
Osama bin Laden and the AI Queda 
network. . 

Tony Blair, the prime minister of 
rcat Britain, ha promised the United 

ta tes strong support in the efforts to 
IJring bi n L.den to justice and find an 
end t world terrorism, but he hi mscl f 
has admitted to a lack of supplies for the 

poor families in the war zones for the 
winter. 

In fact, it is estimated that there is a 
need for more than half the curren t sup-
ply in order to see more than 100,000 
people through the rough season ahead. 
Food is not the only necessity; shel ter 
from the sub-zero. temperatures might 
be hard to come by for those who have 
had their homes destroyed by misguided 
bombs. 

This holy war seems to be d r ifting 
farther from the defin ition of " holy" 
every day. Americans often forget that 
billions of people do not have the free-
doms they do as outlined in the Bill of 
Rights, and one may not protes t dis-
crimination as easily in places such as 

These atrocities have been 
happening for thousands 
of years while Americans 

sit in their kitchens 
complain.ing that they want 

chicken instead of beef. 
And suddenly, when their 
peace is threatened, they 

send young marines out to 
track down and capture or 

kill the offender. 

Somalia and India, where 12-year-old 
gi rls and younger are sold into prosti -
tution to feed their famili es. These 
atrocities have been happening for 
thousands of years while America n si t 
in their kitchens complaining that they 
want chicken instead of beef. And sud -
de nl y, when their peace is tllrcatened, 
they send young marines out to track 
down and capture or kill the offender. 

The truth is that America has had its 
nose in the Middle East since the early 
1950s when U.S. intelligence assisted in 

deposing Iranian Prime Minister 
Muhammad Mussadeq, one of the lead-
ing advocates of nationa lizing the oil 
industry. 

T he Gulf War of 1991 and Operation 
Desert Fox raise serious questions of 
purpose concerning whether our troops 
entered Kuwait to protect the people or 
more to protect our asse ts in the oil field. 
Kuwait exports $1J.5 bi ll ion, mainly in 
petroleum. The United States is one of 
its main trading partners. 

P olitics in Israel raise issues as well; 
America and Israel have been allies for 
over 50 years. When Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations became supervised by the 
United States in 1980-1982, Sinai settle-
ments were the main topic of discussion. 
T h e Uni ted States urged land settle-
ments to halt, but having assets in Israel 
cu rbed any action that might have 
occurred. 

Settlement- building continucd, and 
sti ll conti nues today. We often lash out 
at the Pa lestinian retaliation of Jewish 
leadershi p even in the face of violent 
attacks by the Jews toward Palestine. 
Ins tead, a slap on the hand and a stern 
ta lking-to ensues. 

What will happen now that America 
has called for a stop on terrorism? Of 
course this is a good idea, and America 
has done a fai rly good job at calling for 
peace in fighting countries. With the 
su pport o f our milita ry and presidential 
authority, however, there can be no 
clear definition of what pu nishable ter-
rorist acts are. A retal iation aga inst a 
dominating and threatening re g ime 
might be considered terrorism to the 
government in question. And the 
United States has given quitc an 
impression as to how leadership should 
treat those who have differe nt ideas of 
running things.

Afghanistan, the Northern Alliance is

E dito r: 
T he Guurdiull printed in its 

Jan . 10 article regarding the "Pro-
America Reso lution" th at the 
Unified Campus Coalition is part 
of the Freedom Alliance. This is 
an error, either on the part of your 
reporter or on the part of the 
interviewee. 

For any confusion that I per-
sonally may have caused by failing 
to take action to correct earlier 
inclusions of the UCC under the 
um brella of the Freedom Alliance, 
I du ly apologize. 

While most members of the 

UCC, along wi th most students 
at UCSD, agree with the basic 
Amcrica-supporting tenets of the 
Freedom Alliance's beliefs, there 
are those within our organiza-
tion that I am sure do not sup-
port them. 

A!; our goal is to encourage the 
murual respect for differing opin-
ions on thi s campus so that M 
may learn from each other rather 
than merely fight with each other; 
it would be against our ideology 
to suppOrt one specific side of a 
conflict. 

Having said that, I do not 
believe that it would be a misrep-
resen tation of our membe rs' 
beliefs to say tha t our members 
support the ideal of a diverse and 
benevolent Amer ica as well as the 
belief that we can only achieve 
this ideal by first interacting with 
others who think differently from 
ourselves. 

Through interaction, we 
be lieve res pect will be developed 
and our American ideal can then 
be truly fostered throughout the 
land by learning to see all others 
as unique individuals rather th an 
as si mply members of ethnic, 
reli gio us, racial or political 
classes . 

1 hope that it is now clear that 
the Unified Campus Coalition is a 
nonparti san organization. We 
encourage students of all political 
ideologies to participate in our 
club and VCC-sponsored events, 
such as our inaugural event, "A 
Religious Experience" which will 
be held J an. 30.

Editor: 

In regards to Tbe UCSD 
Guardia1l, vol. 105, issue 2, page 4, 
the opinion section ti tl ed 
"Fighting the wrong battle ... " by 
Daniel Watts: 

In his article, he criticizes 
preferential treatment as a way to 
achieve campus diversity. ] believe 
some of his arguments are flawed . 

He fi rst states that "racism is 
not a fa ctor in UC adrnissions pol -
icy because the current policy has 
been colorblind since the passage 
of Proposition 209." Being color-
blind in this case is a bad thing. 

The racial distribution through-
out many high schools (such as our 
own San Diego ones) are very srrat-
ified. And as Watts points out, some 
schools do not have the advantage 
of AP courses or SAT prep class-
es. 

Thus, no matter the caliber of 
the srudent, they are unable to 
compete with srudents who come 
from the privileged schools. Being

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JANUARY 24, 2002 

Look deeper to find a person's worth 
Society's superficiality makes it difficult to see what matters 
By JESSICA LlNGEL 
Contributing Writer 

I read somewhere that within 
four seconds of meeting someone, 
the brain has already formed its 
initial impression of that person. 
That's all the time you have before 
someone 's subconscious has made 
a preliminary sketch of who you 
are . 

Maybe it's a part of human 
nature to want to judge people so 
quickly, being that it's practically 
unavoidable. We do, as a matter of 
course, rely on generalizations and 
stereotypes. We group, we label 
and we define. And oh, how some 
people cling to those groups, labels 
and definitions. There are people 
who love to label, and those who 
love to be labeled. 

There are people who depend 
on gathering others into eas ily 
defined groups and people who 
count on existing within those 
group definitions. When the world 
is busy being divided into social 
strata and classes, it's pretty much 
guaranteed that first impressions 
will matter.

oners had supposedly taken over 
stored weapons and began to fight 
their way out of the fortress. 

One may see the need for 
defending oneself against a trained,

believing too much in first impres-

how eager people are to judge, and 
judge quickly. 

And maybe if you never had to 
get up in frOnt of a bunch of 30 or 
so random lcids and briefly tell 
them who you arc and where you 
came from (I will never for the life 
of me understand why middle 
school and high school teachers 
inflict this particularly ridiculous 
form of punishment on new stu-
dents), then you won't understand 
exactly how fast those impressions 
are made and accepted. 

After attending three high 
schools in three semesters, I feel 
somewhat qualified to testify to 
the fact that we give way too much 
credit to first impressions. People 
aren't always who they at first 
seem to be. They ca n't be figured 
out in four seconds. We're way 
too complex, way too intricate, 
way too multifaceted. Trying to 
judge too quickly with not enough 

a bit shady. 
As a side note, there is some 

question as to the unconfirmed 
confession of a senior officer who 
reportedly executed 160 Taliban 
ca ptives by lining them up in 
groups of six and using light 
machine guns on them. 

There has been no more word 
on the subject from American 
Intelligence. Was any of the lcilling 
done with a good reason? The sto-
ries are too weak to say either way.

Watts also says that colored 
people are heard plenty around 
campus. He refers to the Cross 
Culnmd Center and lists several 
SAAC organizations. 

But why do you think we need 
those organizations in the first 
place? For the most part, they are 
the only places we can share as a 
minority communi ty. 

And Ross Frank is only one of a 
very few that have direct contact 
with Chancellor Robert C. Dynes. 

Or perhaps that's too naive of 
me. Perhaps that's just letting my 
oh-so-traumatizing new-lcid expe-
rieues mess with my otherwise 
unaffected reasoning (Actually, the 
other day someone told me that I 
seemed well-adjusted considering 
how much my family moved 
around, once again confinning the 
fallacy of first impressions). But we 
shouldn't have to give in to initial 
impressions. We should know bet-
ter. 

Most of us are smart enough to 
consider ourselves more than how 
we dress, what music we listen to or 
the first few words out of our 
mouths. Those generalizations and 
biases create false representations 
that stick, and the inability to sur-
pass that is a fault indeed. 

Don't judge too quickly. We 
judge toO quickly, and that's not 
OK. We rely too heavily on first 
impressions. We give in to the 
first label that comes to mind. It's 
not laziness, per se. It's' not 
because we're too busy to take the 
time to really understand some-
one before forming a reliable rep-
resentation of his or her personal-

some cases, the quality of classes 
(and the necessity of them) falls 
short of the standards we should 
expect from an esteemed universi-
ty. 

It isn't that the quarter system 
is entirely ineffective. 

If the purpose of such a system 
is to educate, then to a certain 
degree the quarter system has 
done so. 

Though many students feel 
that classes proceed at highly 
accelerated rates, adaptation to 
this is possible. 

For these reasons, we fa II into 

It is not a folly to argue that affir-
mative action is ignored if Dynes' 
staff consists of two or three 
minorities compared to 10 or 20 
non-minorities. 

In all respects, J do agree that 
the 4 percent plan in addition to 
outreach efforts are good ways to 
increase diversity. 

But preferential treaOnent is 
still necessary to combat the 
racism that has prevented a truly 
diverse campus between all 
minorities (I've heard many stu-
dents say, U\Ne have a lot of 
minorities, look at all the Asians.") 
They fail to reatire the number of

Americans.

ity. It's not even because the 
human mind forms an impression 
after four seconds of interaction. 
We allow ourselves to believe in 
first impressions because we want 
it that way. 

We like to be shallow. We like to 
believe in the validity of the super-
ficial, when really we know that this 
method is cpmpletely unfair. We're 
so eager to caragorize. You like her 
or you dislike her, he 's cute or he's 
gross, she's funny or she's boring as 
hell. 

In reality, the lines between 
categories are blurry, the divisions 
are unclear, and people can't be 
judged accurately right away. We 
forget tha t there is a middle 
ground. 

If we simply choose to look 
deeper than initial impressions and 
surface appearances then first 
impressions have been entirely 
superseded. 

Don't give in to the shallow-
ness of quick judgments. Don't 
give those first four seconds too 
much credit. People are more

them.

tors instead of the quarter system 
for our academic struggles and 
failures . 

However, the challenge we 
face is to ask ourselves, "Do we 
deserve better out of the univer-
sity?" 

Practical alternatives, such as 
the widely used semester system, 
prove to be effective competitors 
of the quarter system. 

The renovation of the academ-
ic foundation of this university has 
been long overdue, and perhaps 
now its time has come.

"Regardless of enrollment, 
you want to offer the same level 
of quality and programming," 
she said. 

Last year, ERC launched 
ERCapaluau, which members of 
SCERC hope will one day rival 
Muirs[Ock in turnout and tradi-
tion. 

"We want to be able to create 
a tradition to make ERC students 
proud [0 be ERC," Fecht said. 

With the moving of the ERC 
campus to the north side of 
UCSD planned for fall 2003, 
housing for ERC students is 
going [0 be tight in the next cou-
ple of years. Few sophomores 
will be able to live on campus 
because the current E RC resi-
dence halls will house the sixth 
college next year. 

"It's extremely important that 
we have funds to create unity, 
especially next year when we're 
all going to be living in Pepper 
Canyon," said ERC senior 
Armin Khoddan. 

ERC Senator Wendy Ho said 
ERC's move will be talcing much 
of the college's spotlight and 
energy in the next year. 

"Our dean has told- us that 
this might be the last opportuni-
ty to pass this fee referendum 
since we're moving," she said. 

The ERC administration is 
also supportive of the fee refer-
endum's passing, according to 
ERC senior Mike Rosenblat. 

"They want to see everybody 
have a good time," he said. 

Indeed, the raise in fees will 
aid all ERC student organiza-
tions, including the ERC 
Student Affairs Office as well as 
all campus organizations that 
might look to ERC for funding, 
according to Fecht. 

"It~ going to benefit ' all the 
ERC student organizations, as 
well as the fother] student organi-
zations on campus," Fecht said. 

Scott add ressed the concern 
that all ERC students would 
have to pay for the increase in 
funding, but students living off-
campus traditionally do nor par-
ticipate in events as much as 
those who live on campus. 

"The council recognizes the 
need to do outreach for students 
who live off campus," she said. 

The fee referendum requires 
that 15 percent of ERC's student 
population vore in order for the 
results to be considered . This 
roughly calculates to 400 stu-
dents.

'2.~~!-:~~~~~~ CONNECTION 
Northwestern students find flaw in work study 
Work study designed to make students give back to community but at elite universities few do 

(L'-\\lR E) EVA1'1STON, 111 . 
- Recent research by Mcdill 
School or Journali,m graduate Stu-
,kill, on tht: federal work-,tudy 
program has found that some elite 
universities have neglected to 1'01-
10\\ one of the intricacies of the 
Il ighcr Education Act of 1965 -
bringi Ilg atremion from media and 
lawmakers alike to one of the law's 
long - overlooked provisions. 

Although many work-study stu-
dents may think of their jobs as 
opportunities to earn easy money 
during college, the 1965 act estab-
lishing the program aimed in part 
to encourage students to engage in 
community outreach work. By law, 
7 percent of work-study students 
must hold positions that qualify as 
community service in order for a 
school to receive work-study funds 
from the government. 

A Northwestern University stu-
dent would fall into the community 
ervice category, for example, by 

earning work-study money at an 
Evanston school or social service 

agency instead of being employed 
by a university entity such as orris 
University Center or Kellogg 
Graduate School of Management. 

But the findings by the graduate 
students in Mcdill's Washington 
Program show that many of the 
nation's top schools, incl uding 
Princeton University and the 
University of Notre Dame, have fall-
en below the 7 percent off-campus 
requirement. With B.B percent of its 
work-study students in community 
service jobs, N.V. sits above the 
minimum but ranks below the 
national average of ~bout 12 percent. 

The fact that some schools have 
disregarded the 7 percent provision 
of the 1965 act was only noticed by 
lawmakers after Medill graduate 
students brought the problem to 
light. 

The students, working under 
the guidance of Professor Ellen 
Shearer, analyzed the community 
outreach aspect of the work-study 
program and wrote a series of sto-
ries for the Medill News Service 

"Community Service: Are Colleges 
Making the Grade?" 

Washington fIIlombly editor and 
1998 Medill graduate Joshua Green, 
who collaborated with Shearer to 
edit and guide their work, then used 
the students' findings in an article 
criticizing the top-tier universities 
lor devoting little effort to commu-
nity service through work-study. 

Since Green's article was pub-
lished in the magazine'S first issue of 
2002, other prominent news organi-
zations, including The Washnzgtun 
Post, have taken up the cause. 

But the Department of 
Education has not yet acted to 
ensure compliance to the law from 
the schools that have fallen below 
the 7 percent requirement. 

"What surprised me the most 
was that there is a congressionally 
mandated community service 
requirement," said Medill graduate 
student Lisa Smith. "Even in 
researching this story there were 
very few people who even knew 
about this requirement." 

Under a new law proposed by 
Sen. John McCain (R-Asiz.) and 
Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), .U. and 
other chools would be required to 
reach a quota of 25 percent of 
work-study students doing commu-
nity service jobs by 20 10. 

"Currently, only a small fraction 
of college work-study funds are 
devoted to community service, far 
less than what Congress originally 
intended when it passed the Higher 
Education Act in 1965," McCain 
wrote in an article for Warhington 
Momhly. 

But N .U . Associate Provost 
Rebecca Dixon, who oversees the 
financia l aid office, said the 
increased requirement is unrealis-
tic, especially for colleges in rural 
areas where few organizations that 
provide social services exist. 

"Workstudy wasn't designed to 
provide a work force to go out into 
the community," she said. "I would 
be very surprised if the require-
ment rose to 2 5 percent." 

Dixon also criticized individuals

"There arc plenty of [non-work-
study) students doing community 
service and not getting a dime for it." 

Speech senior Sari Schwartz, who 
holds a work-study position at the 
Norris front desk, said she enjoys the 
convenience of an on-campus uni-
versity job and also does unpaid com-
munity service work through Oasis, a 
student-run service organization. 

"I t's a nice relaxed desk job," she 
said. "If you're working during the 
week it can actually be really busy." 

Green, the Washington Montbly 
editor, said schools such as N .U. 
should be encouraged to use work-
study students as ambassadors t 
help improve relations between the 
universi ty and ci ty.

Touring in the fast lane 

S um 41 are a bunch of loud, brash, un bridled youths who burst out 
of Canada last year 

with their album, "All Killer 
No Filler." Although singer 
Deryck Whibley, guitarist 
Dave Baksh, bassist Jason 
McCaslin and drummer Steve 
Jon may hail from the great 
white north, they have cap-
tured tile sound and attitude of 
pure Southern Cali fornia punk. 
They have a reputation for lik-
ing hard liquor, beautiful 
women and acts of mass 
destruction. 

This Friday, along with 
Unwritten Law, they will bring 
the party to San Diego. 

If the band's antics seem a 
tad bit juvenile, perhaps it is 
because Sum 4 1 are just barely 
ou t of thei r adolescence; 
Whibley and Jocz formed tile 
band while they were just high 
schoolers growing up in the 
suburban neighborhood of Ajax 
near Toronto. 

Whibley, disillusioned with 
his mother's new boyfriend, 
would often spend many nights 
writing songs in the back of his 
car. When he was 16, Whibley 
convi nced Greig Nori (of the 
Canadian band Treble 
Charger) to take the band 
under his wing and into the 

recording studio. Although 
Sum 41 had their share of gui-
tarists and bassists, Whi bley 
andJocz managed to score with 
Baksh and McCaslin, complet-
ing the Sum 4 1 lineup. 

On the strength of their 
home video, a major-label bid-
ding war ensued. The band set-
tled on Island Records and 
released an EP, "Half Hour of 
Power," in 2000, but their 
breakthrough success came with 
200 I 's "All Killer No Filler" and 
its first single, "Fat Lip." 

After a year opening for 
blink-182 and appearing on 
MTV's star-studd ed 20th 
anniversary specia l, "Loud and 
Almost Legal," SUIll 41 have 
progressed to their very own 
headlining tour with Poway's 
own Unwritten Law along for 
the ride . The San Diego-based 
punk band has been absent frolll 
the airways since the 1999 COIll-
mercial success of its song 
"Caitlin." However, Unwritten 
Law will release a new album 
titled "Elva" Jan. 29.

The 1960s: pushing onward to the end of a long and winding road 
Part 2 of the 1960s: IThrough the Decades' series looks at The Beatles and a turbulent social, political climate 
By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

The Beatles Of all the international influences on 1960s 
American counterculture, none 
created pandemonium like the 
four lads from Liverpool. 

John, Paul, George and Ringo 
embodied youth, a rejection of 
social norms, ingenuity, and in 
hort, the social revolution of the 
I 960s. The Bearles exuded a conta-
gious energy. Their relationship 
with their fans, their devotion to 
their music, and their humility pro-
jected a sen e of aprroachability. 
These were young me,l whom you , 
wanted to invite into your home. 
T hei r stylistic transitions, their 
musical and spiritual influences and 
social attitudes fully . reflected the 
sentiments of the 1960s. The cre- • 
ation and breakup of The Beatles 
panned the entire decade. 

Lennon's response to an inter-
viewer's inquiry to what Lennon 

expected of find while in Australia: 
"Australians, I should suppose." 
This ability to interject humor 
into their superstar careers helped 
The Bearles prove that there exist-
ed a way out of tough masculinity, 
a feeling associated with male 
musical acts of previous decades. 

By 1965, the phrase "rock 'n 
roll" connected directly to The 
Beatles. By the end of the 1 960s, the 
group had 29 top-ten hits. In less 
than a decade, they sold over 125 
million singles and 85 million LPs. 
Their hit songs like, "Can't Buy Me 
Love," "Eight Days a Week" and 
"Penny Lane," can still be heard on 
the radio today. Just recently a CD 
was released of The Beatles' top 
singles. The fact that the album 
spent multiple weeks at the top of 
the charts is a testament to how 
The Beatles have come to represent 
the youthful joy of the 1960s. 
Television 

By the 1960s, televisions was 
more prevalent in homes than 

indoor plumbing. While television 
was significant in the 1950s, a 
decade later it became a symbol of 
the growing economic trends of 
the decade. Networks also began 
broadcasting in color. 

Youth, independence and 
wealth all became important 
aspects of the American culture. 
As people turned increasingly to 
their televisions, the world got 
smaller. The television brought 
them President John F. 
Kennedy's speeches and his assas-
sination. It brought the first 
human steps on the moon into 
the homes of millions. T he tele-
vision also became a way to justi-
fy w/lat oCcurred in the social 
context of peoples' li ves. A 
plethora of shqws helped to indi -
rectly educate parents on the 
rebell ious nature of their chil-
dren and also helped IIldividuals 
understand their new lifestyles.

Tribute: 'All things must pass' 
A tribute to George Harrison 

By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

I was only a few months old when John Lennon was shot and killed. I had no idea what 
it felt like to have a Beatie pass 
on. But when George Harrison 
died late last November, I real-
ized what it felt like to lose a 
Bearle, a cultural icon and onc of 
my favorite musicans. 

Harrison was probably one of 
the most underrated guitar play-
ers of all time; he tends to be 
overshadowed by the likes of 
Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. 
But Harrison maintained his own 
melodic style. which is evident in 
Beatie songs such as 

"Something" and "Here Comes 
the Sun." Harrison also launched 
a successful post-Beatles career 
with songs such as "All Things 
Must Pass" and "My Sweet 
Lord." 

Harris n was my favorite 
Beatie. Maybe it was because, to 
me, he was thc underdog of The 
Beatlcs. The casual fan seems to 
praise the talents of Lennon and 
McCarmey but forgets how weak 
The Beatles sound would have 
been if it weren't for the lead gui-
tar ta lents of George Harrison. 

But fans should be a ble to cel-
ebrate life the way that llarrison 
celebrated life. As Il arrison 
reminded us, "All Things Nlust 
Pass."

Paul McCartney 
Driving Rain 

Capitol 

*** 
With the end of the 

19605 also came the end of 
one o f the most inn uential 
grou ps in music, The 
Bearles. George Harrison 
and John Lennon moved 
on to successful solo 
careers. WIthin a year after 
the split-up of T he Bearles, 
Paul McCartney formed 
Wings, which went on to 
produce many hits. 

After tlle break-up of 
\Vi ngs in the latc 1970s, 
McCartney went on to 
produce many other solo 
albums. He recfmtly 
relea ed a selection of cov-
ers on "Run Devil Run" 
(1999) and "Flaming Pie" 
( 1997) to strong reviews 
and modest sale . 

It has been four yea rs 
since McCartney has 
released a proper studio 
album. "Driving Rai n" was 

released la te last vear and is 
filled with classic 
McCartney pop songs. 
The sounds arc stripped 
down and there arc some 
odd chord progressions 
th at give a slightly darker 
edge to the entire album. 

The production of 
" Driving Rain" is raw, 
which creates a more inti-
mate element to 
McCartney's voice and the 
rest of the music. This is 
especially evident in the 
rocking tune "About You," 
when McCartney counts 
off the beats before 
launching into the song, 
which features an almost 
D oors-esque organ sound. 

McCartney continued a 
Beatles-pace with this new 
album and played Illore 
bass guitar. The entire 
album was recorded in 
about five weeks with a 
band that McCartney had 
never worked witll before. 

"Lonely Road, " "I Do" 
and "About You" are 
spawned frol11 
McCartney's trip to India 
early in 2001. McCartney's 
son James helped him pen 
" pinning on an Axis" as 
well as "Back 111 the 
Sunshine Again." 
Memories of his late wife 
Linda still linger in "There 
Must Have Been Magic,"

Various Artists 
I Am Sam 

V2 
. 

***** 
The soundtrack for the 

upcoming film "I Am Sam" 
introduces a new genera-
tion to the brilliant song-
writing of The Beatles. 
Sam's obsession in the film 
with The Bearles' songs 
allows the soundtrack to be 
comprised entirely of 
cover songs by artists rang-
ing from industry legends 
such as Eddie Vedder to 
fresh faces such as Rufus 
Wainright and Heather 
Nova. 

The soundtrack simulta-
neou Iy introduces The 
Bearles and a number of 
artists that the general pub-
lic are unfamilia r widl. Each 
cover has a distinct sound; 
at the same time, none stray 
too far from the original 
sound or detract from The 
Bearles' original work. This 
album is a must-buy for any 

Bearles fan as weU as anyone 
who enjoys discovering the 
music industry'S great 
young artists before they 
gain mass appeal. 

While every song on the 
album deserves a listen, the 
standout single is wldoubt-
edly "You've Got to Hide 
Your Love Away," covered 
by EJdie Vedder. Already 
receiving plenty of airplay, 
this song captures the spirit 
of The Bearles and their era 
with a modern, sombe 
sound that Vedder has made 
his own over the last decade. 

Other possible singles 
on the album come from 
solo acts Ben Folds and 
Sarah McLachlan, who 
cover "Golden Slumbers" 
and "Blackbird," respec-
tively. Folds' cover stands 
out because he stands to 
popularize a song that was 
never given the apprecia-
tion it deserved among the 
list of neverending hits 
created by The Bearles. 

McLachlan 's cover IS 
poignant for nearly oppo-
site reasons. McLachlan 
lets the song create her 
sound instead of trying to 
overpower it with her 
tremendous vocal talenr. 
She tastefully recreates 
"Blackbird" in homage to 
Paul McCartney. 

This album should be a 
part of every music collec-
tion.

Bad Religion 
Process of Belief 

Epitaph 

***** 
Now that Mr. Brett is 

back, it's hard not to be a 
true believer. 

Bad Religion's first 
album since the return of 
guitarist/songwriter Brett 
Gurewitz, "The Process of 
Belief," is the hardest and 
deepest record these 
staunchly antibullshit LA 
punks have ever made. Its 
14 tracks hold more sub-
stance than any of the 
group's holy trinity of late 
'80s releases ("No 
Control," "Suffer" and 
"Against the Grain"), and 
they hold together better 
than any of their successful 
early '90s albullls. 

Until 1995, Bad 
Religion had been a two-
man show. Bur in 1993, the 
band moved from Epitaph 
to Arlantic. Two years later,

Graffin's compositions -

is the first Bad Religion 
album where the songs' 
autllOrs are not formally 
revealed, We can be rea-
sonably sure that Gurewitz 
penned the idealistic, emo-
tional ingle "Sorrow," and 
" Prove It" has Gnffin's 
academic signature all over 
it. But other tracks, such as 
the surprisingly mov ing 
protest "K yoto Now!" 
could belong to both. 

Irony and contradiction 
abound, such as religious 
chanting behind lines like 
" I'm materialist/Call me a 
humanistII ain't no deist," 
or the antispi ritualist spiri-
tual yearni ng in "Sorrow." 
These subtleties dri ve 
home the band's philoso-
phy: T heism, society and 
government may be "bad 
religions," but hey, so is 
rock 'n' roll. Graffin has 
said, "You have to beli eve 
in something, or you can-
not live." "The Process of 
Belief" is a good starting 
point,

Ray Manzarek lights a fire in 
his book, 'The Poet in Exile' 
Former Doors keyboardist and co-founder 
writes a rock In' roll fable about Morrison 
By LINDSAY BOYD 
Senior Staff Writer 

When talking to Ray Manzarek, you get an eerie feeling that there might be a ghost in the room. As he sirs in a 
Borders bookstore in Northridge, Calif., the 
mystical energy of The Doors sti ll sur-
rounds him, and one can't help but wonder 
if the Lizard Kin g is not looki ng over his 
shoulder. 

Manza rek never tires of remi niscing 
about his old friend, Jim Morrison, and 
every anecdote is charming and fasci nating. 
In "Light My Fire: My Life with The 
.Doors," Manzarek te lls the true story of the 
band. In his new book, "The Poet in Exile," 
Manzarek adds a provocative (a lbeit fi cti -
tious) findl chapter to the saga of The 
Doors . 

While "The Poet in Exile" is a work of 
fiction, Manzarek admits its plot closely 
resembles the Story of The Doors. 

"It's very close," he said. "It's almost the 
same characters." In the book, a keyboardist 
named Roy from a famou s I 960s rock band 
starts to receive cryptic postcards signed only 
with the letter "J ." Roy believes that this 
could only be the correspondence of his 
band's lead singer, the "Snake Man." Except 
there is a catch - tile Snake Man died in 
Paris ... or did he? 

ConvinQ!d that the Snake Man is ali ve, 
Roy traces the postcards to th e Seychelles 
Islands in the Indian Ocean. There Roy is 
reunited \vi th the former rock god, who tells 
him the story of how he faked his deatll to 
find enlightenment and love in a remote 
tropical paradise . 

While "The Poet in Exile" leaves you 
wondering just who - or what - is buried in 
Morrison's grave, Manzarek points out the 
underlying. message of the book: "The most 
important thing of the book is what hap-
pened to the poet after he stopped drinking," 
Manzarek said. "This book is actually an 
excuse to talk about consciousness. This is a 
man's journey into consciousness. There's 
nothing 1I10re important for you, or for me ... 
and I [wrote] it in a rock 'n' roll fable." 

At rllis book signing in Northridge, fans 

Counesy of Jane Eyre publicity 

Rock star: Ray Manzarek created the familiar 
sound of The Doors with his organ, adding the 
trademark sound to sor.gs such as "Light My Fire." 

of The Door - many of r1lem in high 
school and college - are just as excited by 
Manzarck as their parents were in 1966. 
When asked to explain the timelessness of 
The Doors, Manzarek's answer is simple . 

"They represent freedom, freedom from 
convention." he says. U Frecdom to stand free 
as a man or a woman on the planet if you 
have the courage and can break free of your 
conventional religion, politics, education . 
We repr'csent freedom . I think it's as simple 
as that." .

Investigating: Reporter John Klein (Richard Gere) questions Sgt. Connie Parker 
(Laura Linney) about mysterious events occuring around Point Pleasant 

instead of a "'creature' movie." 
The disturbing aura that 

envelops every scene can on ly 
depict the Mothman as an inhuman 
crearure with unknown motives 
and destructive outcomes, but not 
as a stereotypical monster like King 
Kong or Godzilla. Pellington is 
reminiscent of Hitchcock in creat-
ing suspense by alluding to the 
unknown instead of trying to evoke 
fear by using sheer gore. 

Gere adequately portrays a hus-
band and reponer haunted by past 
events, but his actions often evoke 
frustration and are unexplained. 
The rest of the cast, which includes 
W.H Patton and Debra Messing, 

are convincing. 
Although all the ingredients are 

there, "Mothman" disappoints. It is 
beautifully filmed with scenes and its 
settings evoke fear and concern, but 
the story lacks the cohesiveness that 
would properly conclude the movie.

19605: 
Decade colored by TV, 
tie-dye and tunes 
Continued from page 9 
Jeannie," where a scantily clad in-
gle woman lived with a single man 
who acted as her master, subtle sex-
ual references emerged in the pre-
viously "Andy Griffith"-only living 
rooms. Subtler still were the ideas 
of "G illigan's Island." How did 
three single men survive on an 
island for all those years without 
good-girl Mary Anne and glam-
orOlIS Ginger winding up preg-
nant' It was the original 
"Temptation Island." 

While many critics were embar-
rassed by the crude jokes and man-
nerisms of the characters in "The 
Beverly Hillbillies," audiences 
could relate to the on-screen antics. 
Confronted by newfound wealth 
and different social conditions, 
Americans found Jethro's front-
yard cornfield endearing. After all : 
Dirt is dirt. 

Just as we can say that today's 
producers prefer police dramas, the 
19605 also had television trends. 
Common were alien adventures 
such as "Star Trek" and "The 
Twilight Zone", which garnered 
many viewers. However, indepen-
dent crime fighters (holding true to 
the Bond formula) such as "Batman 
and Robin," with its "warn, bam" 
special effects, and "Mission: 
Impossible," also heralded great 
viewer attention. 

With color television, an oppor-
tunity to entertain younger genera-
tions also emerged . Fred 
Flintstone's "yaba-daba-doo" rat-

tied the set right behind Astro's 
moans in "The Jetsons." And who 
can forget the fuzzy crime fighters 
"Rocky and Bullwinkle?" 

T hese and many other shows 
helped rurn the television into an 
acceptable way for Americans to 
withdraw from the complex social 
context of their lives and enjoy 
another little invention of the 
1960s: Swanson's "TV Dinner." 

The social revolution 
The fundamental question 

regarding the social revolution of 
the 1960s and the crea tion of an 
American counter culrure is: Why 
did such drastic social upheaval 
occur in the first place? 

Improvements in material life 
lead to a youthful power, especially 
in consumerism. The Beiltles 
became a symbol of the 1960s 
mostly because of their talent, but 
primarily because an economically 
powerful fan base elevated them to 
super stardom. The pop culture of 
the 1960s did not come about 
entirely because of the artists but 
because ordinary people chose 
their cultural products. 

Today we associate the 
Vietnam War, space walks, rock 
'n' roll and tie-dyed T-shirts with 
the 1960s. It was a time when peo-
ple were compelled to protest 
racism, hypocrisy and inequality. 
But ultimately these social ten-
dencies did not disappear. The 
1960s reAected the power of the 
individual more than any other 
time in American history. The 
symbols that today 's generations 
associate with the I 96 Os' were parr 
of a bigger picture that helped 
bring about a rumultuou time in 
American history. 

Lingering fans of 'Tron' 
will like the DVD release 
Old visual effects are still stunning but the 
additional features fail to dazzle 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Every couple of year, a movie will take such a huge, progres-sive step in special effects 
technology that it will draw in 
viewers solely to for a big-screen 
spectacle. 

vVhen it was released in August 
of 1982, Steven Lisberger's film 
"TrOll," wl'lich sported a dramatic 
leap in computer animation, was 
one of these films. 

These days, however, the popu-
larity of the film has been relegated 
to a very small grou p of fans 
because of an obvious lack in qual-
ity acting and a drawn-OLlt plot, not 
to mention far too many blatant 
"Star Wars" rip-offs. 

Would nor then an extravagant, 
two-disc collectors edition DVD of 
"Tron" be a little much, can ider-
ing the film's inherent flaws and 
small fan contingent' 

Fortunately, Disney understood 
tile iffy status of its product and 
focuses its recently released "Tron: 
20th Anniversary Collector's 
Edition" DVD almost exclusively 
on its special effects. 

The DVD is replete with atten-
tion-grabbing special fearures on 
"Tron" special effects, which still 
remain visually srulUling despite 
their age, ranging from interviews

14 HIATU THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

An evening at the 'modern' opera fires up emotions 
San Diego Opera's gutsy rendition of a contemporary IRigoletto' adds flair to tra'gedy 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Say the word "opera" and watch the majority of col-lege-age students go running 
in the other direction . The very 
word is enough to bring to mind 
image of antiquated, irrel evant 
plots, dusty and ostentatious cos-
tuming, and dra ma that would 
make most teenagers' lives seem 
dull by compa rison. 

an Diego Opera's production 
uf Giuseppe Verdi's "Rigoletto" 
may change all that. Enter a pro-
duction supervised by the Osca r-

nominated director of "Driving 
Miss Daisy," transplanted to 
modern-day Los Angeles, with 
se ts ranging from Bel Air man-
sions to Venice Beach bars, and 
with costumin g by Giorgio 
Amlani . 

" Ri goleno" traditionally tells 
the story of an eponoymous court 
jester who tries to protect his shel-
tered daughter from his philan-
dering master, the Duke of 
Mantua, only to find that his zeal-
ousness has repaid him with 
tragedy by the end . 

The plot is compelling enough 
in its native 16th century setting, 
but th e move to a locale more rel -
evant to modern viewers makes it 
all the more captivating. Rigoletto 
becomes a fawning agent; " Duke" 
Mantua is a superstar movie pro-
ducer; the assassin Sparafucile, 

who seals the fate of Rigo letto and 
his only daughter, is a Hollywood 
stunt man. 

San Diego Opera's production 
of this classic re tains everythi ng 
of the original voca ls, music and 
plot. It is the se ts and costuming 
that receive the most distinct 
overhaul: soa ring cei lin gs and 
shiny metal decor for Duke 
MannlU's Bel Air mansion and a 
grimy, neon-lit bar and hotel at 
the water's edge for Sparafucile's 
Venice Beach haunt. 

Many characters look as 
though they would be at home in 
some pocket of modern Los 
Angeles, whether it be at the 
Beverly Center shopping for a 
luxury watch or on a corner of 
Hollywood Boulevard beckoning 
sugges tively to passersby. 

T he sets are appealing eye 
candy, but the singers often do not 
make full usc of the area allowed 
to them; as is typical in traditional 
productions, they may loiter for 
many minutes within a small con-
fine. The use of the bar area in 
Venice Beach is a rare time in the 
performance wh en the singers 
exploit the ingenuity of the set 
construction, moving throughout 
the area and interacting with the 
objects around them , 

The cast and crew of 
"Rigoletto" include a diverse array 
of talent, including many who 
have worked with San D iego 
Opera before. 

Baritone Mark Rucker, who 
sings the title role, made his San 
Diego debut in 1996 and has sub-
sequently worked around the 
United States and Austria. 

The show-stealer, however, is

Sam: 
Solid soundtrack outshines 
overly sappy plot 
Continued from page 13 
as it tries to squeeze out every tear 
left in your eyes . 

Penn's acting is nothing short of 
spectacular. Penn is one of the best 
actors today and his performance 
shows why. He acts nanlrally as a 
mentally handicapped father. With 
a childish glee yet loving heart, 
Sam is a lovable character. 

However, it is the adorable 
Fanning, who plays the little child 
of Sam, that captures the heart of 
the audience. Played with such 
emotional charm and loving care, 
it's no wonder why Sam does every-
thing to keep her. 

But even great acting can't save 
this film. The script and direc ting 
don't come together. All the char-
acters are one-dimensional without 
depth and insight. After a while, the 
characters are so predictable and 
formulated that you don't really 
care about them anymore. 

Beyond Fanning, the only thing 
that this film has to offer is a won-
derful soundtrack. Songs from The 
Beatles, covered by other artists, are 
mixed throughout the film . The 
music is an homage to the vision and 
enduri ng strength of The Beatles. 

"I Am Sam" is unfOrtunate in 
that it tries to give an altruistic mes-
sage, but pulls conventional and 
manipulative strings to strike the 
heart but not the lnind. The plot 
drips \vith emotional baggage and 
by the end, it's all too much.

Brothers backbone of 
UCSD's hockey team 
Davis trio keeping it in the family for 
UCSD - to the dismay of opponents 
By MICHAEL SCARPELU 
Contributing Writer 

Dynasties don't necessarily need 
to involve Michael Jordan, Joe 
Montana or Wayne Gretzky. They 
don't need to involve exorbitant 
salaries and multirniUion dollar sta-
diums packed with thousands of 
screaming fans. All some dynasties 
need is a family. 

UCSDs ice hockey team is in 
possession of one such dynasty. 
Senior Chris Davis, junior Keith 
Davis and freshman Kevin Davis 
are three brothers who got their 
start in hockey with golf clubs and 
a roll of Bubble Tape. Now, rough -
ly eight years after the sibling trio 
got their start in the hockey world, 
they have become an intimidating 
force in the collegiate hockey com-
munity as the Triton's first offen-
sive line. 

The Davis brothers have taken 
their natural talent for icc hockey 
and added the bond shared by sib-
lings to create a tightly meshed 
brand of hockey that is difficult to 
replicate in any other lineup. 
Rather than letting the stereotypi-
cal familial in-fighting get in the 
way of things, the brothers use 
their shared experiences to improve 
their game. 

"We learned all together. We 
taught each other how to play," 
Keith said . "So, when you play with 
somebody for eigh t years, you 
know exactly what they're going to 
do." 

That sort of mutual learning is 
the real key to the Davis brothers' 
elCJ>losive offense. Whereas most 
lines consist of players who have 
gathered their collective hockey 
knowledge from numerous coaches

She led the 2001 squad in sacrifice 
bunts and sacrifice flies. Playing in 
all 51 games last season, Aggabao 
studied the competition in Division 
IT and is certain that the 2002 team 
will be a potent component of the 
CCAA. ' 

"We arc coming back strong 
this season ," commented Aggabao. 
"vVe have a strong core of girls, and 
our rookies have caught on to our 
game plan very quickly." 

Also returning for UCSD is 
sophomore shortstop/tllird base -
man Amy M cnee, who led last 
year's team with a .382 batting 
average, a .554 slugging percent-
age, 29 runs scored, 60 hits, 7 
triples, 87 total bases, II sto len 
bases and 177 plate appearances. 
Mcnee returns to her second year 
on the Triton team stronger, more 
competitive, and more learned of 
the competition that she and her 
teammates will face together, 

"Togcther" is the key word. 
Teamwork and support are prime 
focal points of the 2002 UCSD 
softball team. 

"Determination and hard work 
influence our play, but our m'ain 
focus this season is going at the 
game as a team," Aggabao said. 
"We set goals at each practice and 
strive to achieve them together in 
an effort as though we are one 

and teams, the Davis brothers have 
always been on the same page in 
relation to their playing styles. 

"There might be some good 
hockey players out there, but if 
we're not buying into the same sys-
tem, it's going to be a lot harder for 
us to play together," Kevin said, 

Using their hockey philosophy, 
Kevin, Chris and Keith have led 
UCSD hockey to a dominant posi-
tion in both the American and 
Pacific Collegiate Hockey 
Associations, soundly defeating 
opponents from all over the nation. 
This season, the squad has netted a 
total of 121 goals in their 13 -2 sea-
son. Of those 121 goals, 77 were 
scored by the Davis line: a whop-
ping 63 percent of UCSD's entire 
offense. 

Thankfully, UCSD hockey 
shares its philosophy with the 
Davis brothers. 

"J ust dump it in and keep it low, 
because if we keep it behind the net 
the whole time, in their zone deep 
- how can they score)' Keith said. 

Beyond that shared sense of 
hockey stratagem, the brothers also 
share in a strong sense of family 
when out on the icc. 

"My favorite thing would be: 
You come into the zone full speed 
and I'll pass it to Keith and Keith 
will pass it to Kevin right away and 
Kevin will hit a beautiful shot right 
into the net," Chris said . "When 
you JUSt click like that, I think it's so 
much better being brothers." 

The Davis parents, Susan and. 
David, also get in on the act, taking 
time out of busy schedules to travel 
with the team and sec their sons play. 

"I'm so much happier out there 
with my brothers than just with 
some random person," Kevin said. 

unit." 
While in the dugout, team 

members encourage the batter at 
the plate. Defensively, the infield 

'and outfield rally round their hard -
working hurlers. 

Splitting the rime at pitcher, 
seniors Leea Harlan and Christi 
Martinelli resume their place on 
the mound for the Tritons. Harlan 
and Martinelli, with 1.48 and 2.29 
earned run averages, respectively, 
provide a sound fo undation of 
composure and poisc teamed with 
speed and ski ll for UCS D. 

T h e attitude of the UCSD team 
is contagious. It heads into the sea-
son secure in its ability as a team, 
and is committed to surpassing the 
com peri tion, 

UCSD's rival , UC Davis, will be 
that competition this year. The 
Tritons split thei r four-game bout 
with the Aggies 2-2 in 200 I, and 
will now look to defeat them in 
UCSD's first CCM home game of 
the year on Feb. 8, 

The Tritons continue ' their 
opening home stand against Chico 
State, which UCSD defeated three 
out of four times last season, and 
will then battle the Coyotes of 
CSU San Bernadino, who went 0-4 
against tile Tritons in 200 I . 

With speed, skill, strength, con-
trol, experience and heart on their 
side', the coaches and the players of 
the 2002 UCSD Triton softball 
team arc ready for CCAA action. 

"We have what it takes to win 
the conference,' Aggabao said. 
"!t's up to us to take care of busi-
ness."

Golf has 
hope for 
nationals 
Coach optimistic 
after losing top 
four players 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's golf team goes into the 
2002 season facing an uphill chal-
lenge ill its second year competing 
in Division II, but head coach Mike 
Wydra thinks his team is up to the 
task. 

The Tritons managed to capture 
tifth place in last year's California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
cha mpionshi p, finishing just 10 
sh·ots our of a National California 
Athletic Association West Regional 
berth . This year, however, the 
Tritons have lost four of their top 
five finishers, ,vith only sophomore 
Alan Scheer returning. 

Despite losing those players, 
Wydra believes his team has dra-
matically improved. 

"This is by far the most talented 
team [ have ever coached," he said. 

Junior Ryan Gale is expected to 
lead the team this season. 

"He is one of the best players in 
Southern California," WY9ra said. 
"1 expect him to travel to every 
tournament this year." 

G'lle already has one top 10 fin-
ish this season, finishing in 10th 
place at the Eko Invitational in late 
October. 

The team participated in two 
fall tournaments, placing in the 
bottom half of <:ach event despite 
playing well. 

At the Eko Invitational, the 
Tritons fini hed 12th out of 15 
teams. 

A week later, the team finished 
16th Ollt of 20 teams at the Prestige 
- a tournament packed with 18 
Division [ teams, with only UC 
Davis and the UCSD representing 
Division II. 

Despite disa ppointing fall 
resul ts, Wydra looks forward to big 
things this easoll. 

"\ " e're gomg to noti onals this 
year - our tc,"n is that good," he 
said. "Last season, we had problems 

ad l ll~ ting to the teams in Division 
[I , but this season will be different." 

Another pusitive going into the 
,ea ,on is the yout h nf the ,quad. Of 
the II ac tive m<:m bers of the team, 
there arc fou r lu niors, fIve sopho-
mores and twu fres hmen. Vvydra is 
also red- hi rti ng four players . 

"The fOllr red shirts would 've 
been stars on <lny of my teams in 
the past 20 rears," Wydra said, 

illu~trating the depth of his squad. 
The Tritons open the season 

Feb. II when they compete at the 
Point Loma Nazarene lnvitational 
at Riverwalk Golf Course in 
.V1ission Valley. 

That tournament will mark 
the beginning o f a stretch of six 
[Ournamenrs in five weeks, 
capped off with the Southern

Track and field ready for season 
Coach predicts third place for both men and women 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

After traveling to Edward ville, 
Ill., last year to compete in the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Division II Track and 
rield Championships, both 
UCS D track and field teams arc 
looking to improve in 2002. 

"We were real, real pleased 
[about last year's results)," said head 
coach Tony Salerno. "It was a break-
duough year." 

graduated last year and was 
UCSD's best performer in the 
5,000 meter run. 

However, they will be seeking 
contributions from their newcom-
ers to pick up the slack. 

"We picked up some real stellar 
people on the men's side," Sa lerno 
said. "J eff Conkey is going to con-
tribute greatly in the sprints; Brad 
Slinkard as well." Salerno is also 
looking at Brian Parisi, Trevor 
Takayama and Steve Smith to earn 
points for UCSD. 

The men's team, which finished 
fifth in the CCAA championships 
and 29th in the national champi-
onship, returns several of their top 
performers from last season. 

But it will be hard this year, as 
UCSD will be facing stiff compe-
tition. League rivals UC Davis and 
Chico State both placed higher 
than the Tr·itons in the national 
championship last year.

Returner Jonathon Wong 

placed second in the 1,500 meter 
run in league championships, then 
went on to race to the 13 th spot in 
the nationals. 

Senior Rob Ewanio heads up 
the field competitors after placing 
fifth in the nation in the shot-put 
event. Ewanio also placed first in 
the league championships. 

"Our conference is tough, it's 
easily the most challenging con-
ference in Division II," Salerno 
said. "We've gotten a lot better but 
I think our conference has as well, 
which sort of neutralizes us."

place St. Augustine's College. 

Junior Audrey Sung leads the 
young Tritons of 2002, after plac-
ing second in the 3,000 meter run 
in league championships and sixth 
in the nationals. 

"Liz Brinkman is certainly a 
key person," Salerno said. 

Junior Jackie Vu (pole vault), 
sophomore Hillary Mills (800-
meter run) and sophomore Minnie 
Hernandez (shot-put) all return to 
the Tritons after placing high in 
league championships last year. 

"He's our top returner," 
Salerno said. "He won conference 
last year and our conference in 
that event happens to be better 
than most Division [ conferences." 

The women's track and field 
team is also seeking to better last 
year's results. 

The Tritons placed fourth in 
the CCAA track and field champi-
onships last year, finishing behind 
UC D avis, Chico State and Cal 
State University, Stanislaus. 

"She is definitely our big gun," 
Salerno said. "We're looking for-
ward to having Meredith Perry 
back; she was injured last year. 

Salerno is already looking 
toward the end of the season. 

"Our big focus is on conference, 
and hopefully we'll do well in 
nationals after that," he said. "We're 
going to aim for third on both the 
men's and womens sides. We are 
hosting the conference this year, 
which gives us a good chance."

Tennis returns ,core of playoff teams 
Experience a new addition to teams' already potent arsenal 

Guardian File photo 
Power backhand: UCSD's Melisa Liao is one of 
the many returns for the women's tennis team 
which fin ished 16-6 last year. 

By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD men's and women's tennis teams, 
preparing for their first competitions of the 
year, are both looking to improve on last year's 
seasons when both squads made waves in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Association and 
advanced to postseason play. 

The women's team finished 16-6 overall and 
7-1 in the CCAA last year. At the CCAA Team 
Conference Championships, the Tritons defeat-
ed California State University, Los Angeles 7-2 
and Grand Canyon University 5-0 before falling 
to defending CCAA champIOns UC Davis 6-3 in 
the finals. The Aggies handed the Tritons their 
only league los 7-2 earlier in dIe season. 

"Our goal is to win the CCAA," head coach 
Liz LaPlante said . "Last year, we came in sec-
ond to UC Davis. We had to play indoors 
because it was raining, so it wasn't really a great 
day for us. This year, our match is at home and 
we think we have a good chance to beat them. 
But our goal is to be o. 1 in the conference 
and to qualify for nationals." 

However, UCSD's second-place CCAA fin-
ish last year put the Tritons in the ational 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Championships-West Region tournament, 
where they defeated Hawaii Pacific University 

5-3 to earn a berth in the National California 
Athletic Association Division II National 
Championship Finals in Pensacola, rIa. There, 
the Tritons were knocked out of the first round 
by Abilene Christian Universi ty of Texas 5-2. 

UCSD returns a team that lost only one 
senior and was predominately made up of 
freshmen . i\nodler asset to the team is the 
addition of freshman Jasmin Dao, who 
LaPlante said· will be one of dle team's top 
players this season. 

"Last year we struggled in doubles, but this 
year we're definitely going to be better tllcre," 
returning player said Kristina Jansen. "Jasmin 
is a really good addition to the team, so the top 
of our 5ingl~ lineup is going to be pretty 
strong, and our team is pre tty deep. 1 think we 
have a pretty strong [cam this year, and we can 
do a good job and reach nationals and hopeful-
ly do well. Last year we were kind of injured 
when we got there . ~ 

Though the team returns virtually intact 
and has the home-field advantage against rival 
UC Davis, not every factor is in its favor. 

"We don't really have a tough schedule, so 
tllat could hurt us when we get into a regionaJ 
tournament and possibly nationals," Jansen said. 

Despite the weaker schedule, the Tritons 
have twO players who were voted to the AlI-
CCAA First Team last yea r: Jansen and Julie 
Westerman. Lynd ey 1adlock, the team's lone 
senior dlis season, was an All-CCAA Second-
Team selection. 

"We did really well last year," LaPlante said. 
"We had a lot of frcshmen, so they've gai ned a 
lot of experience and confidence from last year. 
It's that experience that's going to help us, so 
now it won't be new to everybody and they 
know how hard to have to work to win." 

UCSD had previously captureu four nation-
al titles and four runner-up titles at the 
DiVIsion 1JJ level under LaPlante, the.. win-
ningest coach in Division in history. 

"I expect to finish as strong as· we did last 
year - we finished 11th in the country," 
LaPlante said . "1 hope to fin.ish anywhere from 
eighth to 12th in the country, so if we did that, 
I'd be really happy. " 

The men's team looks to improve on its 10-
I 0 overall, 7-4 league record from last season . 
The Tritons, who hosted the first round of tile 
NCM playoffs, advanced with a 5-0 win over 
Cal Poly Pomona before falling 6-1 to the sec-
ond-ranked team in the nation at the time, 
Brigham Young Univer ity-Hawaii. 

" ne of our goals is to make the playoffi , but 
this time to make nationals," said men\; head 
coach Erik Steidlmayer. "Last year we made it to 
the playoffs in our first year of Division II, but I 
know our guys want to make it to nationals this 

year." 
This year's squad brings a lot of experience, 

\vith 10 players returning from las[ year's [cam, 
and all of them are expected to help. 

"Our top two, J\1ichael Nleyer and Jeff 
Wilson, are key, but I think everyone's going to 
have some sort of contribution this ycar," 
Steidlmayer said. 

Rounding out the squad are three new play-
ers: Bryan Swart, Emil Novak and Doug 
Hofmann. 

"[Thosel three guys are going to have an 
impact," Steidlmayt!r said . "They look good . 
We haven't had any matches, but I think that a 
couplc of thom will probably start in the top 
six, and we'll see from there." 

The team is optimistic 50 far, :lnd as long a~ 
they can all gain experience and improve, 
everything else will take care of itself, accord-
ing to Swatt. 

"We have three strengtlls," Steidlmayer said. 
"One is our depth. [ think we can really do well 
with anyone playing in there. Another strength 
is our condi tion. Physical fi mess will be a big 
strength for us. The third is our willingness to 
win; we're going to playa lot of long rallies and 
try to wear opponents down a little bit." 

Swatt agrees that having more quality players 
\vill definitely be an advantage in competition. 

"We'll have about eight deep for six spots 
and not lose too much toward the bottom of 
the lineup, so ollr depth is defini tely a 
strength," Swatt said. 

Still, tqe team needs to be able to attack 
more than they are doi ng now, a weakness lhey 
need to address, according to Steidlmayer. 

"We're playing the best we can with our 
style, but we don't have a lot of att:lcking play-
ers," Steidlmayer said. "We have good defen-
sive, counter-punching players. That's good, 
but tllat might be a weakness if we go up 
against a team dlat does well against a counter-
punching or a defensive style." 

Things wi ll be competitive for the Tri ton, 
since they compete in a CCAA division that 
features several improvt!d tcams. 

"We're going to stack up fine," Steidl mayer 
said . "Cal State-L.A. and Cal Poly Pomona are 
gready improved, and U Davis ,viII be as 
strong as they've been, but I like our chances 
against all tho e tcams. It just depends on how 
well we come to practice and work from there. 
If we can do that, I think we'll do really well 
against those teams." 

The women begin their sea on aturday 
with an away match against CSU San 
Bernadino, which is also their first CM 
meeting of the season. The men's team plays at 
the Cal Poly Pomona Individual Tournament 
Feb. I to Feb. 3 in Pomona.

As one of the few Division II 
sports programs on campus that 
competes against Division [ oppo-
nents, the UCSD women's water 
polo team challenges the best colle-
giate teams across the nation. 

Facing a tough schedule featur-
ing USC and Michigan, as well as 
Western Water Polo Association 
rivals Loyola Marymount and UC 
Davis, the team posted a 20-13 
record for 2001 and a solid third-
place finish in the WWPA. Coach 
Larry Sanders and his squad expect 
to raise the bar of accomplishment 
in this upcoming season. 

"We should be as good as last 
year," Sanders said. "I expect us to 
win the league championship." 

He has good reason to feel con-
fident. With only two seniors grad-

uating last spring, the team stays 
virtually intact. Eleven players 
from the 2001 squad return for this 
season, eight of which saw signifi-
cant playing time last year. 

Key returning players include 
senior Emma Krudit't.k.i, a two-year 
captain and leading scorer last year 
with 62 goals, junior Samara 
Silverman, who broke the team 
record for steals with 62 takeaways, 
and junior Dana Tucker, who 
Sanders feels has the potential to be 
one of the top players in Division 11 . 
Much is expected from this group, 
and they reHec! the same feeling. 

"This very likely could be our 
best team during my four years 
here," Kruditzki said. "It's going to 
be up to the juniors and seniors to 
carry this team." 

Adding to this talented mix are 
new faces that will only improve a 
team already filled with experience. 
Sanders and his staff bring in eight 
new players for the 2002 season. 

immediate-impact players 
include junior college transfers 
Stephanie Lombardo and Elizabeth 
Keesey. Lombardo helped her col-
lege to back-to-back state champi-
onships during her tenure as goalie 
and is slated as a starter for this year. 
Keesey comes from Grossmont 
Junior College and brings valuable 
experience and depth to the team. 

Sanders has also started building 
toward the funlre with six freshman 
members on his team. One of them 
isJessica Wong, a speed and defen-
sive-skills specialist who is just 
happy to be a part of the squad. 

"I feel that playing at this level is 
a dream," she said. "I never thought 
I would be here and now that I at\I, 
it's unbelievable." 

A tougher schedule than last year 

awaits the Triton women's water 
polo team. The season starts Feb. 8 
at home against Hart\vick College. 

Key match-ups include home 
games against Michigan (Feb. 27), 
Princeton (March. 16), San Diego 
State (March 17 and April 19), 
Long Beach State (Mach 10), and 
UC Sunta Barbara (Feb. 15). 

The Tritons will face league 
rival UC Davis on the road, as well 
as visit Long Beach State, San Jose 
State and Santa C lara. For this 
squad, they will be aiming particu-
larly at their league rivals. 

"Every game gets us prepared 
for LMU and UC Davis," 
Kruditzki stated. 

Added Sanders: "They are our 
biggest obstacles to the [WWPAI 
championship. " 

Also scheduled is a home game 
against the defending national 
champion UCLA (Marc h 16) . 
When asked about playing a team 
as talented as UCLA, Kruditzki 
simply said, "You only get better 
playing the best." 

With the start of the season less 
than two weeks away, things arc look-
ing bright for the Triton women. 
The excitement and unity on the 
team can be felt among its players. 

"I think the team has really come 
together during these past couple of 
weeks," Wong said. "We've 
improved a lot since fall practice and 
the chemistry is really Aowing 
through the team right now." 

Kruditzki agreed with her. 
"I love this group of girls and 

we're winners no matter how the 
seaSf)n nlrns out," she said. 

Sanders summed it all up by 
stating, "Here is an opportunity 
[for UCSDI to watch top athletes 
compete at a top level."

he will start as a shortstop, a posi-

The Tritons have 56 games on 
the schedule this spring, and each 
one is of equal importance. 

Beaven noted the mentality of 
team. 

"We're trying to keep every-
thing on an even level, " he said. 
"One thing we are trying not to 
do is build up one game over

O'Brien wants his team to

common goal to help themselves 
focus throughout the season.

I honestly believe that there is sometlling special about spring sports. It's hard to explain, but 
there is a hint of magic, a tingling 
you get from seeing competition 
the way it was meant to be seen: 
under tile brilliant sun and on a 
field of grass 0 lu h and green it 
deserves its own crayon color. 

Former ommissioner of 
Baseball Bartlett Giamatti hinted at 
this feeling when he described 
haseball: 

" It's designed to break your 
heart . The game begins in the 
spri ng, when everything is new 
again, and it blossom in the sum-
mer, filling the afternoons and 
eveni ngs, and tllen as soon as the 
chill rains comes, it stops, and 
leaves you to face the fall alone." 

And although UCSD spring 
sports don 't continue into the sum-
mer, they do begin at that magical 
time when the earth starts to shake 
off its winter slumber and begins to 
reawaken. 

While I dearly love basketball, 
football, occer and the other fall 
and winter spons, they are at a 
decided disadvantage in that they 
are played indoors or in cold 
weather. 

But spring sportS are played dur-
ing tllat perfect period of ti me when 
the young sun has yet to find its 
summer heat, when the air is crisp 
and each day is longer than t~e pre-
VIOUS one. 

As everybody emerges from thei r 
winter den with the SlID, half-blind-
ed and stumbling into the light, the 
magic gets hold of them and 
deposits them on fields and courts 
where they find themselves panting 
and sweating in the throes of com-
petition before they even know it. 

I t's special for the athletes and 
coaches as well. 

For this is the time when last 
cason is just a memory, and a new 

year is poised to begin and grow 
along with the earth's season, with-
out any hint of victory or d isap-
pointment evident for any team yet. 
This is the time they have been 
practicing and traini ng fo rever for 
- it is the time when they can 
finally end the inter-squad scrim-
mages, drills and conditioning to 
begin some rea l competition. 

This is the time of ultimate 
democracy because right now, 
every single team is tied fo r fi rst 
and has as good a chance as any-
body else. Right now, rookies are 
setting foo lishly high goals and 
dreaming of what they can accom-
plish in thei r first year, while 
returners are assessing the teams' 
strengths and weaknesses without 
worrying too much about thei r 
own. 

Right now, all the schemes 
coaches dreamed up in the off-sea-
son are executing fl awlessly, and 
their visions of their team is as well 
put-together as a jigsaw puzzle. 

Right now, fa ns haven't had 
their hopes dashed, and all brim 
with optimism over the incoming 
season. For it is the beginning of 
the season, when everybody flocks 
to games and cheers themselves 
hoa rse around mouthfuls of hot 
dogs and beer. It 's new and exciting 
to see the new players, and

2002 a new year 
Tritons seek to improve 
ByANU KUMAR 
Staff Writer 

After a dismal 14-34 overall 
record during the 2001 season, 
the UCSD men's baseball team 
has room for improvement this 
spring. The Tritons hope to make 
a full rotation and achieve success 
with a handful of key returning 
players and several new additions 
to the team. 

Over the course of 48 games last 
season, UCSD never experienced a 
winning streak longer than three 
games, which the Tritons accom-
plished only once. The team did 
have six different stretches where it 
lost at least three games in a row. 

"It was a challenging year for 
the baseball program," said 
UCSD head coach Dan O'Brien 
about the past spring. 

If the Tritons want to gain 
respect and be a force in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, the team will have to 
improve on last year's 7-28 
record. 

Looking at his team for this 
upcoming season, O 'Brien is 
excited about the talent he has on 
the roster. 

"We have an excellent combina-
tion of returning players, as well as

one of the best recruiting classes 
ever at UCSD," O 'Brien said. 

To anchor the five-man pitch-
ing rotation, the Tritons will have 
senior John Beaven and junior Alex' 
Crernidan return to the team. Last 
season, Beaven went 4-8 and had 
an earned run average of 4.91 in 88 
innings pitched. Crernidan, who is 
recovering from surgery, had a 
record of 2-4 with a 6.29 ERA, but
