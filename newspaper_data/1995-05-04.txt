Judicial Board has heard an 
increased number of cases 
involving academic and social 
misconduct, according to 
Board Chairman Aaron 
Carruthers. Under UCD 
policy, misconduct ranges 
from collaborating on home-
work to the use of marijuana. 
Statistics provided by the 
board show it has received 52 
more referrals this year than 
last year. The board first 
receives referrals from 
students ' complaints, upon 
which the student in question 
is summoned. If an agreement 
is not reached between the 
student and the board, a

Congress to Vote on 
Loan Cuts Next Week 
RNANCIAL AID: Proposals 
to cut $12.5 billion in aid 
likel y to end federally 
subsidized Stafford loans 
By Ben Ellin 
Associate News Editor 

Student advocates expect the Stafford 
Subsidized Loan program to put its first foot 
in the grave next week when Congressional 
Budget committees vote on a proposed $12.5 
billion cut in higher education funding. 

The Senate and House Committees will 
vote on Monday, May 8, and Thursday, May 

11, respectively, to decide the fate of loan 
subsidies, which many lawmakers believe 
are too costly. 

If approved, the proposal will then be 
passed to the Education Committee, which 
would trim $12.5 billion in education spend-
ing from the federal budget. 

According to Glenn Magpantay, execu-
tive director of the University of California 
Students Association (UCSA), the most likely 
victim of the budget cuts will be federally 
subsidized student loans. 

"Stafford subsidized loans cost the gov-
ernment [$12.5 billion] each year," said

Peltason Names 
Two San 
Joaquin Sites 
ForlOthUC 
CAMPUS: Construction of newest 
university contingent upon 
availability of state funding 
By Jonna Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

Students in the San Joaquin Valley may finally be 
able to attend a UC campus near home if state funding 
allows for the construction of a 10th UC campus at one 
of two prospective sites, 

In an open letter to the UC Board of Regents, UC 
President Jack Peltason announced Tuesday that Table 
Mountain in Madera County and Lake Yosemite in 
Merced County had been chosen as the finalists in the 
search for the site of the next UC campus. The final 
selection will be made during the May 18-19 regents 
meeting in San Francisco. 

The Site Selection Task Force (SSTF), composed 
of two regents, an alumni representative, a faculty 
representative, two chancellors and three university 
vice presidents, has spent the last six years narrowing 
down the field from 85 different locations to the two 
finalists. 

"I made this recommendation because both sites 
have such outstanding attributes that each deserves 
full consideration by the regents," Peltason wrote. 

"I also believe that the location of the next UC 
campus is of such importance that it is an issue on 
which it makes sense to draw upon the collective 
wisdom of the board," he added. 

According to the task force, Table Mountain was 
recommended because of its "proximity to the major 
population and cultural c~nter of Fresno." The SSTF 
said that community support and site aesthetics were 
contributing factors in the selection of the Yosemite 
Lake location. 

Mark Aydelotte, spokesman for the UC Fresno 
Regional Office, said it was important to build the next 
UC in the San Joaquin Valley, where the number of 
students who attend a UC is half that of other popula-
tion centers. 

"The San Joaquin Valley has the largest population 
that is unserved by a UC!" he said. "The reality is, for 
a student in the San Joaquin Valley to attend a UC, 
they have to move." 

Aydelotte said that financial issues also deter 
Joaquin Valley students from attending a Uc. 

"The valley has a lower cost of living than any other 
part of the state," he said.

Regent Davies Against Affirmative Action, Supports Fee Hikes 
MEmNG: Davies 
discusses his position 
on issues with UCSA 
By Marianne Villi 
Associate News Editor 

UC Regent John Davies took a 
stand against affirmative action pro-
grams and voiced his support for fee 
increases at a meeting with Univer-
sity of California Student Associa-
tion (UCSA) members Monday. 
Members of the new student organi-
zation Students Promoting Equality 
through Action and Knowledge 

(SPEAK) also attended the meet-
ing. 

As part of a new systemwide 
campaign, UCSA members around 
the state have organized similar 
meetings with other UC regents in 
an effort to gauge where they stand 
on issues that will be voted on in 
upcoming Board of Regents meet-
ings. 

Targeting fee hikes and potential 
federal financial aid cuts, the 
UCSA's "Access: Stop Turning 
Back the Clock" .:ampaign protests 
the decreasing accessibility to higher 
education. 

Davies said that affirmative ac-
tion has come to mean a number of 
different things to different people, 
but added that "I don't like affirma-
tive action if it means racial prefer-
ences." 

According to Davies, the regents 
will consider individual programs 
when discussing the future of affir-
m'ative action at their May 18-19 
meeting in San Francisco. 

"I think outreach programs are 
positive, but I'm not convinced that 
they need to be race-based," Davies 
said. "They could be based on ob-

Scientist Refutes 
HIV-AIDS Connection 
RESEARCH: Dr. Peter Duesberg says prolonged 
drug use and other factors cause AIDS 
By Ted Ladd 
Senior Staff Writer 

Blasting the accepted scientific 
tht:ory that HIV causes AIDS - as 
well as several leading UCSD AIDS 
researchers - UC Berkeley profes-
sor and scientist Peter Duesberg 
spoke at the Joyce Beers Commu-
nity Center in 
Hillcrest Tuesday. 

Speaking to ap-
proximately 150 
people, Duesberg 
delivered a two-
hour lecture refuting 
HIV- AIDS theory, 
arguing instead that 
prolonged drug use 
and other factors are 
the sourceofthe dis-

"The CDC is the equivalent of 
our defense department, fighting a 
war against something it can't de-
fine," said Duesberg. He also ar-
gued that Flossie Wong-Staal, a 
UCSD AIDS researcher, and other 
scientists have failed to produce a 
"virus in T -cells" in their own labo-

ratories, 
According to Dr. 

ease. 
During his lec-

ture, Duesberg said 
that the theory that 
HIV causes AIDS is 
falsely supported by 
tests using the poly-
merase chain reac-
tion (PCR), a bio-
iogical tech~ique 
.developed by Nobel 
laureate Dr. Kary 
Mullis. Duesberg 
~Iaimed that PCR is 
tgsed to amplify a 
problem that does 

"The CDC I. the 
equivalent of 
ourdefen .. 
department, 
fighting a war 
against 
somathl ... they 
can't detlae," 

Duesberg, the cause 
of AIDS-likesymp-
toms is either con-
tinual drug use, con-
sumption of high 
dosages of AZT or 
exposure to other 
illnesses which 
damage the body's 
immune system. 
Showing enlarged 
pictures of AZT 
bottle labels with 
skulls and cross-
bones, Duesberg 
said that the drug is 
a poison whose 
side-effects include 
death. 

Claiming that 
UCSD is a major 
player in the "great 
AIDS research lie," ~Du"'" 

Researcher, Duesberg said 
UC Berkeley Professor UCSDscientistsare 

not exist - namely, small and in-
substantial HIV viruses in patients' 
cells. . 

"[HI V) is only in one out of ev-
ery 500 to 1,000 [CD4 T-helperJ 
cells," Duesberg said. "That's why 
[HIV]-infectedpeoplecanoftenonly 
be found with [PCR)." 

Duesberg also said that the eight-
to-l0-year"latency period" in HIV-
infected persons - a time frame in 
which the virus does not cause harm 
to the host - does not follow the 
standard characteristics of an infec-
tious viral disease. 

"There's no such thing as slow 
viruses. We have slow microbiolo-
gists, but not slow viruses," 
Duesberg said, referring to the rela-
tively slow process offinding a cure 
for AIDS. 

In addition, Duesberg claimed 
that the Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC), which has spearheaded 
milch of the AIDS research in the 
United States, has documented 4,600 

,&.IDS-diagnosed patients who have 
tested negative for HIV. 

ignoring his hypoth-
esis simply because they "don't like 
to talk about [research) that brings 
in a lot of money." 

Dr. Richard Haubrich, an assis-
tant professor of medicine at UCSD 
and an AlDS researcher, disagreed, 
calli ng Duesberg a "fringe person. " 

"The evidence is so overwhelm-
ing [that HIV causes AIDS]," 
Haubrich said. "I usually refuse to 
talk about [Duesberg's theory] be-
cause [doing that) adds credence to 
a false theory .... He does a grave 
disservice to the community with 
his actions. " 

In response to Duesberg's alle-
gations that UCSD has failed to 
produce results, Haubrich said it 
was possible to isolate the virus 
and that "[PCR] has nothing to do 
with it." 

Haubrich added, "If you just look 
at the weight of the evidence, 
[Ducsberg's) theory is ludicrous. I 
could say that the moon isn't made 
out of green cheese, and he would 
probably say that! didn't sample the 
right part of the moon."

Magpantay. "It seems to me that 
subsidized loans is the only place 
where it can come from." 

Student advocates say there is 
little chance that the $12.5 billion 
cutback will be turned down at this 
stage, but they remain upbeat about 
the level of student activism on the 
issue. 

"The amount of work that stu-
dents have been doing all over the 
country is tremendous," said United 
States Student Association (USSA) 
member Laura McClintock. 

than 51,000 UC students received 
subsidized student loans lut year, 
while nearly 66,000 CSU students 
received the subsidy. 

If loan subsidies were eliminated, 
interest would accrue tbroughout the 
duration of a student's education, 
and would either have to be repaid 
immediately or compounded onto 
the loan's principal. 

The UCSA estimates that the 
average cost of a four-year educa-
tion in California would increase by 
$5,350 if the subsidy is eliminated. 
This would amount to a $523 mil-
lion increase in state-wide educa-

The UCSD Guardian 

lion costs for the 1995-96 flSCll year. 
McClintock said it would be pos-

sible for the Education Committee 
to leave the Stafford subsidies in 
place by cutting funds from other 
higher-eduCltion programs. She 
added tbat the Direct Loan Program 
could be made more co5t-efficient, 
thereby increasing funding for 
Stafford subsidies. 

However, McClintock said such 
a scenario is unlikely because the 
Education Committee chairs in both 
of the chambers of Congress are 
opposed to the Direct Loan Pro-
gram. 

The federal government pays 
interest on subsidized loans until six 
months after the student leaves 
school, at which time only the loan's 
principal must be paid back. Be-
cause subsidized loans are usually 
offered to students who display fi-
nancial need, opponents believe its 
elimination would hurt lower and 
middle-class students, 

Subsidized Stafford ~ were awarded to 51,058 UC 
and 65,864 CSU students for the 1993-94 school year. 
Below are the breakdowns by system. The average loan

"The average student is being

Duesberg's 'Crack Pot' 
Ideas Cannot Be Ignored 

uc Berkeley Professor Peter Duesberg has a theory 
which makes many people nervous - especially those 
involved in AIDS research. Duesberg, who has become a 
veritable black sheep in the scientific community, has spend 
the last several years trying to discredit the widely accepted 
theory that HIV causes AIDS. According to Duesberg, the 
devastating disease has little to do with the virus - or 
unprotected sex - but rather severe, prolonged drug use 
and other non-HIV-related environmental co-factors. 

Although the scientific community has refuted 
Duesberg's theory within the confines of obscure scientific 
journals and low-profile scientific forums, it has largely 
refused to do so publicly. 

Many of these researchers claim it would be "dangerous" 
to let the public know of Duesberg's theory via the media, 
saying it might lead people to believe that current AIDS-
prevent ion methods, such as using condoms, are unneces-
sary. ~y call Duesberg a fringe element and allude that 
he is rnissiQg .. few marbles. 

But if Duesberg is so wrong and out of touch, then his 
adversaries should stop all tbe secrecy and speak up. Either 
Duesberg is 011 to something and researcbers are afraid of 
loosing' glaJit' mSirey, as'be. ~A~!ms, ~~,~o.re likely, they fear. 
addressing his theories wiU-g.ve them 9'Â¢ence. Howeyer, If 
the ~ien9fic community thiDks that Duesberg's claim that 
HIV.doesn't cause,AIDS isdangerous, disproving his theory 
publicly could save the very lives they fear Duesberg 
threatens. 

Alarmingly, the press has said little about 
Duesberg's anti-HJV hypotbeses, The media is focused on 
either the murder trial of an ex-football star or the dragging 
out of childrens' bodies from a bombed-out building in 
Oklahoma. But this - a controversial theory on the cause 
of AIDS - bas been relegated to obscure publications and 
underground media. Amazingly, the press appears to be as 
paranoid about the issue as tbe researchers. 

However, the press, following the lead of the scientific 
community, would rather ignore the issue. But Duesberg 
will not disappear. He has already published his ideas and 
research in a book. Nobody can argue against Duesberg 
within the confines of his own work, but any decent news 
story would include the opposition - which, as almost 
every credible scientist will tell you, is quite fonnidable. 

Dean's Irresponsible 
Actions Spoil ElectionsÂ· 

After enduring last year's A.S. elections, which were 
marked by a seemingly endless string of frivolous election 
violation charges, we hoped never to hear the phrase, 
"elections rescheduled" again. However, when Revelle 
Senior Senator Aaron Lipner filed a grievance against 
Revelle Dean Renee Barnett for extending the candidate 
application deadline without infonning all Revelle students, 
we were grateful that someone was watching out for the 
democratic process. 

The dean's erroneous actions were made worse by her 
refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing. Barnett responded 
to these charges in a letter which stated, "I think that extend-
ing opportunities for students to be involved is [a] larger 
concern than ... technicalities." 

Denying students their right to a fair democratic process 
is hardly a technicality. In fact, it's a serious misuse of 
power. As a college dean and a supposed advocate for 
students, Barnett should have known better. 

Following Lipner's request, the RevelJe College Council 
has rightly voted to rehold its council elections. Hopefully 
Revelle administrators will take Lipner's other request to 
heart: Reprimanding Barnett for her shockingly unprofes-
sional behavior.

FOR WHOM THE WEDDING 
BELlS TOLL 

COMMENTARY: Marriage is a showcase for riotous relatives, huge 
. bills, Jordan almonds and frighteningly ugly polyester dresses 

JENNY 

LInn 

One of my closest friends 
from high school is geuing 
married this month, and I'm 
going to be her bridesmaid. I've 
been listening to her wedding 
plans for the last year and find 
it difficult to believe the 
amount of detail required to 
plan the "perfect wedding." Ev-
erything must be carefully se-
lected, color-coordinated and 
paid for: from 
the church to 
the tuxedos to 

Jaundiced I the custom-
pri nted ribbons 
around the 

lillie mesh bags of Jordan almonds 
at the reception. 

ner was cooked just right. 
Weddings have enormous potential for chaos, given 

that they involve large numbers of friends, associates 
and, best of all, families - with alliances, secrets and 
rifts. Brides must deal with problems such as: What 
are the new spouses of divorced Mom and Dad going 
to do during the Parents' Dance; what will tbe in-laws 
think if Aunt Lizzie gets drunk and starts singing Notre 
Dame fight songs like she did at cousin Sarah's wed-
ding; what if a champagne-enhanced Grandpa decides 
to take up his cesseless and vociferous defense of 

Lyndon Johnson? 
Happily, these are the bride's prob-

lems. As a bridesmaid, I am burdened 
with no such concerns. My issues are 
quite different. I went into a state of 
panic when my friend showed me 
some of the bridesmaid dresses I could 
possibly be wearing. 

The funny thing about weddings is 
that brides and all the other people in 
charge spend months planning every 
single detail so that "nothing goes 
wrong." After going to a perfect wed-
ding, you depart with a vaguely pleas-
ant impression that it was quite a 
lovely event; it blurs together with all 
those other perfect weddings you have 
attended. 

Brld.smald 

Bridesmaid dresses are notori-
ously hideous. The unofficial expla-
nation is that to make the bride look 
beller, you want all the other young 
women should look as bad as pos-
sible. Of all the strange wedding tra-
ditions, I think this should be the first 
to go. I find it difficult to understand 
why one would deliberately impose 
such profound ugliness on the women 
who are supposedly one's dearest 
friends. 

However, the most memorable 
wedding occurrences are inevitably 
things that went wrong. For ex-
ample, the wedding of Prince 
Charles and Lady Diana: My only 
memory from that storybook event 
(except that it was clearly a grave 
error in the first place) is that Diana 
mixed up all Charles' names during 
the vows. 

Unless your wedding is being 
covered by the international media, 
it is the errors - the delightful, un-
controllable "human comedy" of 
weddings - which make them en-
joyable. No one will be doubled-over

fensive color. 

Bridal magazines advertise pages 
and pages of nightmarish creations. 
They look as if they were designed 
when Yves St. Laurent and Donna 
Karan were hanging out, smoking 
something wacky, and they started 
sketching while giggling, "No, wait, 
wait, what if we did this!" I've never 
seen anything naturally composed of 
any of these colors, which shine glar-
ingly in their polyester glory. Not only 
do we have this dress to deal with, we 
have to punish an innocent pair of 
shoes by dyeing them to match the of-

Thunday, May 4, 1995 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY: Chicano newspaper concentrates on making La Raza the perpetual victim of 
white domination rather than emphasizing self-empowerment and responsible citizenship 

HYPOCRISY ALIVE AND WELL IN VOZ FRONTERIZA 
By Peter Chana 
Staff Writer 

With the imminent demise of 
the Koal4, the campus' official hu-
mor paper, UCSD will be deprived 
of rich, ironic and outrageous 
printed witticism so integral to the 
collegiate experience. In the search 
for a suitable substitute, I've 
stumbled upon VozFronteriza. For 
those of you whose memory of 
high school Spanish is limited to 
phrases like Donde ut4 el bai/o? 
and No tengo dinero, senor, Voz 
Fronteriza translates roughly to 
Chicano Victim hood Rag. The 
kindest thing which can be said 
about Voz is that it is a humor news-
paper, albeit unintentionally so. 
Recent editions do not inspire a 
glowing Rview. 

Picking up the March issue, I 
was greeted with a pictuR of Gov. 
Pete "I swear I'm notgonna run for 
president" Wilson, with cross hairs 
centered around his head and a cap-
tion which read, "Wanted: Pete 
Wilson Raza Enemy '1." Pete Wil-
son, states the subcaption, is 
wanted for the following crimes 
apinst LA Raza (the people): Cut-
ting education from kindergarten to 
the university level, supporting the 
abolition of affirmative action, 
building mOR prisons and signing 
tbe Three-Strikes initiative. These 
will confine La Raza to prisons, 
kick La Raza out of school, stop LA 
Raza from receiving medical caR, 
cut La Raza's welfare benefits, and 

so on. 

Curiously, theR is no mention 
of crimes committed by "LaRaza" 
which got them into prison in the 
first place, no mention of the fraud 
which is involved in illegal immi-
grants cuhing in on our money-
vomiting welfare system and no 
mention of the extent to which af-
firmative action discredits and di-
lutes the value of college degrees. 
Turning the page, one is greeted 
with a bold declaration from the 
editor: The California Civil Rights 
Initiative (CCRI) is the "Latest At-
tack on the Mexican People. "It de-
cries the fact that "Mexicans will 
fall victim again to unfair, racist 
laws. Racist gringo politicos who 
support OCRI say they simply seek 
the principles of a colorblind soci-
ety embodied in the 1964 U.S. 
Civil Rights Act. The CCRIÂ· will 
prevent at even higher rates, Mexi-
cans from attending college, get-
ting hiRd at skilled and profes-
sional jobs. " 

Think that's funny? It gets bet-
ter:

2S percent and we have increased 
financial aid." 

Because one third of tuition goes 
back into financial aid, Davies said 
that lower-income students who rely 
heavily on financial aid are pro-
tected by the higher fees. He added 
that lower fees would subsidize 
wealthy families. 

"Nearl y 70 percent of students in 
the UC system come from higher-
income families and it doesn ' t make 
a lot of sense to me that the taxpay-
ers should subsidize the education 
of those students." Davies said.

America's 
Embarrassment 

I feel like an ugly Ameri-
can. 

I feel like those cheesy 
American travelers who sign 
up for" Adventure Tours" in 
other countries. I feel like 
those Hawaiian-shirt-wearing, 
Nikkon-carrying, "Ricki 
Lake" -watching, cholesterol-
consuming, Forrest Gump-
worshipping, compact car-
driving, beach-going, trendy 
tourists. 

What, you may ask, has 
made me feel this way? It 's 
really quite simple. It's the 
America's Cup. Talk about a 
blight upon our land. Talk 
about an embarrassment of 
epic proportions. Talk about a 
pathetic excuse for a sporting 
event. It just makes me sick. 

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS 9 

Flashed across millions of 
TV screens and written about 
in hundreds of papers, people 
around the world keep up with 
this sailing spectacle. And jusl 
what can they be thinking? Is 
this what America is all about? 
Is this the bread and butter of 
the 01' U.S.A. Well, in a 
simplistic way, il is . 

Mter all, the America's Cup 
is very much about the worst 
aspects of American life. It's

Chris Miyake was down on thIs play, but he and the Tritons were on their feet when he ran horne .. the wlnnln, run In the ninth. 

about ... 
Utlgatlon. Races during 

the event are won in the 
courtroom more often than out 
on the open seas. For a nation 
transfixed by the O.J. Simpson 
trial, the America's Cup is the 
perfect elixir. In facl, I read in 
a serious article somewhere 
that being a adept tactician -
skipper of the boat - involves 
making adept arguments to the 
governing board. Pitiful. 

UCSD Makes Its Point 
NARROW ESCAPE: Tritons surrender five runs in the n.inth, but hang on vs. Point Lorna, 12-11 

Corporate Money. Dennis 
Conner gets a second chance at 
the final races after losing fair-
and-square. Because of merit? 
No. Because of boat problems? 
No. Because of unfair wind 
conditions? No. Because a 
bunch of big companies paid 
lots of money to sponsor him 
in the finals? Bingo. 

Misguided Feminism. 
Don ' t tell me you didn 't hear 
the rallying cries. "We can do 
it beller than men!" they 
exclaimed. "We don't need 
their help!" they screamed. 
"Down with sexism'" some 
wailed. "Bill Koch is a brave, 
noble man!" others crooned. 
Of course, all this blatantly 
divisive feminism pervad ing 
the Mighty Mary boat lasted 
about as long as its crew was 
wiliing to lose race-upon-race. 

See DISGRACE, Pal:.e 13 

Staff Writer 
It took four hours to complete. 

But after 23 runs, 28 hits and 10 er-
rors the Tritons got the job done. In 

the longest game of 
the year played at 
Triton Stadium, 
UCSD notched its 
23rd victory of the 

.. season with a close 
~ 12-11 win over Point 

Loma Nazarene. 
Senior Dan 

O'Brien came through in the bot-
tom of the ninth with a clutch two-
out single to drive in teammate 
Chris Miyake for the winning run. 

"I am happy to be part of this 
thing, and God willing everything 
will work out [for the play-offs]," 
O'Brien said. "Somedays you win, 

Game at a Glance ... 

somedays you lose, and sometimes 
it rains." 

UCSD improved its record to 23-
13, barely hanging on to the hisi 
pI a y -off spot. 

Freshman Nathan Celusta got the 
nod to start for the Tritons, picking 
up the slack for an overworked 
pitching staff. ucsn was coming 
off a weekend tourney, and Head 
Coach Robert Fletcher was forced 
to go with an inexperienced, yet 
fresh arm. 

Celusta showed early game jit-
ters, giving up three runs in the first 
inning. UCSD, however, answered 
in the bottom of the first, tallying 
four runs of its own. 

Triton leadoff hitler Eric Quandt 
singled to right field, and Junior 
Bobby Arban walked to put two run-
ners on base. Chris Miyake was the 

next batter, and he 
promptly lined a

double to left field, 
scoring two runs.

Miyake, C. 2 singles, 4 RBI, scored winnIng run 

Still with no outs, 
Craig Birk hit a 
rocket to fi rst base, 
and the Crusaders 
first-baseman was 

able to knock it down to keep 
Miyake from scoring. UCSD then 
a\tempted a double-steal, as Birk 
was caught stealing at second. 
Miyake managed to score from 
third. 

The inning was 
far from over be-
cause AI DelFavero 
singled and O' Brien 
drew a walk. 
DelFavero moved to 
third on one of the 
eight Crusader foul-
ups, and he scored on 
Carl Abramson 's 
ground out. 

"[Point Loma] 
made a lot of errors, " 
Fletcher said. "We 
still left a bunch of 
guys on base, and we 
could have scored 
some more runs." 

Point Loma 
grabbed single runs 
in the second and 
third innings to take 
the lead, but the TriÂ· 
ton hometown 

at five apiece in the bottom of the 
fourth. Celusta contributed four in-
nings of work and gave way for re-
lief pitcher Mike Bryant in the fifth 
inning. Bryant finished with three

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Sailing 

It's been a month of 
strong winds, calm seas 
and spectacular racing 
for the UCSD sailing 

At the St. Francis Invite in the 
San Francisco Bay the next week-
end, the UCSD sailors manuvered 

-through rough winds, a 35-mph 
storm and a harsh cross-current. team. 

The Triton skippers weathered 
four recent race series - the South 
Series VI and VII, the St. Francis 
Invitational, the North Series VI and 
VII, and the Pacific Coast Champi-
onships - garnering several solid 
finishes in each event. 

USC hosted the South Series VI 
and VII races on April 1-2 at the 
Belmont Pier in Long Beach, CA, 
and UCSD made its presence 
known. The Tritons snatched up 
fifth-place overall on Saturday 
among a fierce 14-team field. 

Stanford grabbed first, while UC 
Irvine and UC Berkeley stormed 
into the second- and third-place 
sJots at the event. 
, The UCSD varsity 'A' boat of 

Greg Korn and Jamie Trinh led the 
way to a third-place finish for all 
Southern Division teams, while the 
UCSD varsity 'B' boat of Jason 
Pettit and Eric Wilcox also did well. 

J . V.'~rs Shannon Farley, Joy 
Brown, Bryan Scaveau and Nicole 
Roberge showed that the Triton sail-
j ng future looks bright. 

On Sunday, the UCSD varsity 
crews slipped to seventh place and 
third place among Southern Divi-
sion schools.

ing team to a fourth-place finish-
behind California State-Sacra-

rage Collegiate Water SIci Open last 
weekend. 

Berk, a consistent standout for 
the team all season long, continued 
his string of fine performances by 
grabbing fifth place in the hard-
fought men's competition. 

"He's really made a concerted 

"It took some teams 45 minutes 
just to cross the start line," Triton 
skipper Pettit said. "That's a testa-
ment to how difficult this race was." 

Still, UCSD managed to pull out 
quite a few top-lO finishes in its 
new 14-foot"FJ." boats. 

The third weekend, on April 15-
16, brought up the North Series VI 
and VII races on the Triton sched-
ule - at Stanford's Sailing Center 
on the eastern San Francisco Bay. 

The varsity 'A'and 'B'boatsdid 
their usual damage, dashing to sev-
enth place and fourth place on Sat-
urday and Sunday, respectively. 

J. V. sailors Kevin Carney, 
Nathan Gloier, Jason Hannigan and 
Roberge rotated in various boats, 
gaining experience along the way. 

UCSD's most recent race, the 
Pacific Coast Championships, was 
held last weekend at the U.S. Sail-
ing Center in Long Beach, CA. 

"The wind blew very hard," 
Pettit said. "The race really deter-
mined the best sailors overall." 

Competing with a round-robin 
format, in which teams rotate into 
different boats each race, the Tritons 
managed to capture seventh.

week out," Head Coach Bill 
Schneiderwind said. "He's the best 
all-around skier we've ever had [at 
UCSDJ." 

Berk struggled in his favorite 
event, the trick, but he excelled in 
the jump competition, improving 
his personal best by two feet and 
leading the Triton men's squad to 
fifth-place overall finish at the 
competition. 

But -it was the performance of 
Waggenseil which was the high-
light of the road trip. Placing 13th 
in the slalom, 12th in tricks and 
fourth in her specialty - the jump 
event - Waggenseil skied to a su-

perb fourth-place overall. 
"I'm certainly pleased for her," 

Schneiderwind said. "It looks like, 
for the first time, that a UCSD 
freshman will qualify for [NCAA] 
Nationals. " 

With Waggenseil's teammate, 
Sara Nystrom, claiming ninth-
place overall, the Triton women 
finished a strong second to their 
Arizona hosts. 

Berk and Waggenseil now ap-
pear certain to be selected to com-
pete as representatives of the West-
ern Region at the National Colle-
giate Water Ski Association AlI-

UCSD was coming off 
four wins at the La Verne

weekend. The Tritons 
won their first three 
games: 8-6, 7-6 and 12-5. 
Mark Hartmann (3-1), 
Marc Abrams (3-1) and 
Steve Height (7-4) picked 
up the wins, respectively. 

"We played really 
good ball," Fletcher said. 
"The pitching was there, 
and Ward came up real big

UCSD broke the game open with 
three runs in the sixth and two more

cakewalk, as the Crusaders came up 
to bat in the top of the ninth inning, 
trailing by five runs. 

UCSD, however, decided to 
make it close. Closer Andy

walking the first three bailers. Theo

"I had great defense behind me," 

Ward said. "We still have a chance 
at the playoffs. We just have to play, 
because [getting selected for the

After a sacrifice fly brought in 
one run, Point Lorna began its "In-

a double-double brought in four 
more runs to tie. Robins (2-1) fi-

My Family, Mi Familia 
Director Gregory Nava discusses 

discrimination in Hollywood 
By Simone Mille, 
Senior Staff Writer 

Director Gregory Nava, whose 
debut film EINorte (1983},drew aiti-
cal acclaim for its portrayal ofGuate-
malan immigrants living in Califor-
nia, was at UCSD on Sunday to pro-
mote his new film, My Family/Mi 
Familia , which opened yesterday in 
theaters throughout San Diego. 

The film chronicles three genera-
tions of a Latino family living in Los 
Angeles. Nava spoke about his film 
and Latino issues during a recent in-
terview. 
GuarcUn: In addition to eli-
I8CIinI, you wrote the screen-
play for My F". 
Did you bale the ICript 
on yOW' own e~ 
ences? 

Nava: I did have a very 
large San Diego-Tijuana-
based extended family ... and 
I spent a lot of time in the 
barrio in East L.A. [where 
My Family is set) ... but this 
film is based on a lot offamilies I have 
known ... a lot of stories other people 
have told me. I also spent eight months 
doing research on the barrio ... so it is 
a composite of a lot of people's lives. 
YcMi .. one of the few, If not 
the only cIrector who has ,.

wood? 

... Studiosjustwon'tgiveusmoney 
- it's just closed. Latino films are 
seen as ethnic and strange, not com-

mercia I. I'd just say thatthere is a lot 
of discrimination. 
There have been a few films in 
the last years emphaslzin& 
Latino, or Mexican cuIbre, 
such as Like Water fOI' Ch0co-
late, which had a wide 'oIowÂ· 
ing and were critically ac-
dainIed â€¢â€¢â€¢ 

Yeah, but what others can you 
think of? 
Well there was Isabelle 
Allende's House of Spirits, 
yet that calt only American 
stars, and used an American 
clrector â€¢â€¢â€¢ and MI VIda Loca, . 
about cirI PIllS in L.A. 

But how many movies 
are released a year? 
Hundreds ... You can only 
name three movies in this 
many years? So it's effec-
tively zero. Statistically, it's 
nothing. The population of 
the United States is about 
250 million people, you fig-
ure 30 million of them are 

Latino. That's a sizable chunk of the 
population of the United States, and 
nobody is making movies about them 
orforthem. 
How do you see this situation 
improYina? 

Well, I think you need to do two 
things: I think there need to be pro-
tests .. . and people do need to work 
politically. And then filmmakers need 
to make movies - and struggle in 
order to do it. It took us si" years to do

Blonde'srenditionof"Misty 
Mountain High," is nearly a 
deadringer to the original. 
While singer Linda Perry's 
bad-girl vocals sometimes emerge to 
give "High" a femme twist. they're 
mostly lost within the song's structural 
sa meness. "Alternative" favorites 
Stone Temple Pilots don 't do much 
beller with their unplugged version of 
"Dancing Days," a clean, well-pro-
duced, yet utterly uninteresting take 
on the original. Other bands which 
make their showing - from Duran 
Duran to Big Head Todd and the Mon-
ster - are neither here nor there. 

Only two artists stand out on this 
12-track exercise in tedium: Sheryl 
Crow and Henry Rollins. Crow's ren-
dition of "D'yer Maker," which has 
earned heavy radio play, is the high-
water mark. Sounding like a scrappy 
17-year-old, full of wiggly energy and 
anxiety, Crowbrillianlly resurrects the 
famed Zep lune,givingthis heartbreak 
story a fresh , female spin. And, as 

with Plant 's vocals with undue force. 
Never Mind the Bride comes in a 
distant second for its defacement of 
Zeppelin's sappy, but enduring, "Go-
ing to California." 

The producers and artists missed a 
wonderful opportunity with Enco-
mium: Rather than injecting Zeppelin 
with a fresh beat,they've managed to 
slavishly regurgitate what Plant and 
Co. slapped down on vinyl over two 
decades ago. 

But perhaps we shouldn't expect 
more. As retro becomes a surrogate 
for inspiration, postmodernism is ex-
ulted as a virtue and Generation X 
continues to exhume its cultural arti-
facts, Encomium: A Tribute to Led 
Zeppeiill is painfully in step with the 
times, proving once again that, yes, 
the song remains the same.

I don't know. Maybe it will help. 
Why would you tNnk II would 
help? 

Maybe people will be more mo-
tivated to go [see the film] because 
they find [Proposition] 187 repul-
sive or maybe people will go just 
because it is just a good movie. And 
they'll identify with it because it is 
about family and maybe it will 
change their minds about Proposi-
tion 187. Who knows? Of course, 
Mi Familia is about a legal immi-
grant family - they're here about 
the same time most families came in 
from Italy and Russia and Germany, 
in the 1920s and the teens. 

It doesn't directly involve illegal 
Latinos. Latino doesn't mean iIIe-
gal. But unfortunatelY,1 think things 
like 187 are an attack on the entire 
Latino community. People start to 
resent all Latinos, which is very, 
very wrong. The whole thing is baf-
fling. So I .;an't say that I'm a big 
fan of Prop 187 at all.

The Basketball Diaries 
Film makes its anti-drug 
message painfully clear 

By Cere Udell 
Staff Writer 

Not exactly a movie dedicated to 
sports, The Basketball Diaries de-
picts the tragic story of a talented 
teenager who comes of age by im-

drug usage or a period when drugs 
temporarily disrupt one's life. The 
Basketball Diaries continues the tra-
dition by portraying drugs and rebel-
lion as a passing, experimental stage 
of adolescence. 

The UCSD Guardian Thursday, May 4, 1995 

mersing himself in a life of 
drugs and addiction. Based 
on Jim Carroll 's 1963 auto-
biography of the same title, 
the film follows a 13-year-
old boy along his destruc-
tive journey from college-
bound basketball player to 
homeless criminal and 
junkie. 

Unfortunately, this story does not 
stand out as new or original. It is 
something we have all seen before in 
literature and film as well as on tele-
vision. Stories about drugs typically 
concentrate on either a lifetime of 

While the film explores 
Carroll's triad of interests 
- basketball, poetry and 
heroin - drug use eventu-
ally comes to dominate the 
screen. Leonardo DiCaprio 
(What 'S Eating Gilbert 
Grape and This Boy's Life) 
plays Jim 's character with 
conviction. Acting as a 

heroin addict for the majority of the 
film, he is constantly strung out and 
desperately in need of his daily fix.

Jim Carroll (Leonardo DICaprio) .waa .... with some of hi. Catholic school boy â€¢â€¢ 

Despite DiCaprio's admirable act-
ing, the film does not do a convincing 
job capturing either the era or the 

authenticity of this story. Overall, the 
screen adaptation falls short of main-
tainingCarroIl's style of journal writ-
ing. The use of personal narrative is 
fragmented.

The ending of the film also di-
verges from the original book. Direc-
tor Scott Kalvert incorporates that 
grand Hollywood touch by adding a 
distinct and, in this case, false sense of 

closure which teaches a lesson. 
While Carroll's book offers no 

resolution to his debaucherous life, 
the film ends on an artificially posi-
tive note.
