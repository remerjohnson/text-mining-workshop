Pub Bidder 
Soured by 
Contract 
To Goldy 

By Eric Harpell 
and Jon Goetz 

The decision to award the 
ne w Student Center pub 
cont ract to " Goldy ' s " was 
" pre m e ditated ," rejected 
bidder Chris Morrison has 
charged. 

Henry Goldy was awarded 
the contract last month and 
should sign a contract with the 
administration this week, but 
Morrison claims the Student 
Center Board committee that 
examined the bids didn't fairly 
consider the applicants. 

" Anyone who takes an 
objective view of this thing will 
see that the students got 
screwed, " Morrison says, and 
he is threatening to take the' 
matter to court. 

Three groups, Future Foods, 
Goldy's and Morrison's 
"Cadillac Cafe" entered in the 
bidding for the on-campus pub. 
Acco rdine to PutoebaltftgOfffee 
spokesman Terry Bennett, both 
Cadillac Cafe and Future 
Foods , " did not meet the 
selection criteria." 

Among the guidelines 
established for selection of a 
bidder were management 
experience (at least three 
years) and history o(blisiness 
performance . . Future Foods,

in bar management was not

Saltman: Keeping Track· of Self 
Unorthodox Ways Fit Perception 
Of 'Existential Self As 'A People' 

By Kathy Huffer 
Associate News Editor 

As the self-proclaimed "number-two man on campus," Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs Paul Saltman extends hjmself far 
beyond the boundaries of the university . 

Saltman views himself not as an administrator but as "a 
people" - an educator, athlete, scientist, family man and leader, 
components of what he calls his " existential self." 

Through the year Salt man has developed a prominence which 
has taken him across the world and has often placed him in the 
media spotlight. Yet on campus, he maintains a sometimes 
controversial reputation within the administration. 

. A "Radical" Man 
DUring his 14 years as a biology professor at the University of 

Southern California, Saltman recalls being considered a " radical 
crazy" by many of his peers and administrators. 

A falling-out with the administration convinced Saltman to 
leave USC, and in 1967 he arrived here to serve as both a biology 
professor and Revelle provost. 

Here Saltman was "seen as a fascist pig by everyone," he says, 
AlthoUlh he does not believe this reputation entin:ly justified, 

finds that some of his early activities fit the description. 
Saltman's efforts and eventual victory in eliminatinl many 

donn rules were considered "radical" in the late '60s, as was the

Today, seven years into hi tenn as vice-chancellor, Saltman

Surfing Days 
Still Not Over 
When the surf's up, one may 

find Paul Saltman away from 
his Academic Affairs Office 
"body whomping" at the 
beach, 

Saltman says that surfing has 
been an integral part of his life 
for 40 years, a spiritually 
fulfilling way of providing for 
an " existential extension of the 
self. " 

"The surfing professor," as 
Waterworld once called him, 
has been hitting the beach since 
before he entered Cal Tech as 
an undergraduate. 

He remembers the days when 
120-pound redwood and 
mahogany surfboards were

Alcohol Fuel Growing 
Brazil Shows Way With SugarCane Conversion, 

Stepped Up Since '73 Crisis Raised Fuel Bill 

By Hal BenlOn 
Pedflc: Newa Sen1c:e 

I n the middle of the vast fields of sugar cane whicb cover much of the ferUle red 
lOti of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, 

stand twelve silver towers which rise up from a 
concrete pad. 

The lite is not lOme secret Brazilian missile 
instaUation but a 25,000 ,allon a day distillery 
which transforms .ugar cane into ~ 1" proof 
molOr fuel. The distl1lery Is one small co, in a 
maalive Brazilian enerty program to substitute 
home brewed alcohol fuels for costly imported 
petroleum. 
(RGI sernton, un IIl\.Wtiggt .... reporier on the stQ// 0/ 
Jock AncNrlOfl, recftiy Ntumed /rom a tour 0/ 
Brazil'. "pohof' ·incilstry. Bemton is curnrntiy 
writirw a book on the •• Jbject.) 

Brazil's ambitious program has aroused 
tremendous interest in the United States where 
Midwest and Southern farmers are attemptiDi 
to launch a new alcohol enerlY industry. In Iowa 
alone, over 400 service stations now market 10 
percent alcohol-gasoline blends called 
"gasohol." Consumption of the blend in that 
state has increased from 2.6 million lallons a 
month last December to 5.5 million lallons in 
March. 

A Department of Energy study reports that 
alcohol distilled from organic materials could 
replace 30 percent of the nation's liquid fuel 
consumption. A congressionally mandated 
study of gasohol options for the U.S, will be 
completed lhill spring. A source involved in that 
study claims it will have a positive impact on the 
movement for lasohol in the U.S., despite 
resistance to the movement among the major oil 
companies and automobile manufacturers. 

In the past year a steady stream of U.S. 
scientists, farm groups, su,ar cane refiners, 
auto company officials and investors have flown 
to Brazil. to study various aspects of the new 
energy program. 

Brazil's gasohol production swung into hi'h 
gear after the 1973-74 011 crisis tripled Brazil's 
foreign oil bill to 54 billion and threatened to 
cripple its vaunted "economic miracle." Brazil 
had an advanta,e over other countries - it had 
been blending alcohol (ethanol) with gasoline 
since the early 1930's as a ·convenient way to 
dispose of surplus sUiar stocks. 

Between 1976 and 1978, Brazilian ethanol 
production registered a nine-fold increase, and 
19'19 production levels can potentially replace 
70,000 barrels of oil a day - almost 7 percent of 
the nation's annual oil imports. 

B y the mid-1980's, Brazil plans to have 320 new distilleries at /I cost of ,1.1 billion. 
Brazil hopes to bave all of the nation's 

automobiles running on a 20 percent alcohol-
gasoline blend. Already the entire city of Sao 
Paulo is fueled by the blend whicl) , with 
carburetors adjusted to the leaner fuel mix, 
deliver the same milea,e as relUlar Brazilian 
gasoline. Studies by Volkawa,en-Brazil show 
carbnn monoxide emissions in the 20 rcent 

blends cut by half, hydrocarbon emissions cut 
by more than a third, and nitrogen oxide 
emissions up only sli,htly. 

The same major oil companies that 10 far 
have resisted development of gasohol in the U.S. 
flave been forced by the Brazilian ,overnment 
to sell the 20 Percent blenda. Texaco, Exxon and 
Shell all offer the blend to BraziUan motorista at 
over $1.50 a ,alloo. 

Production COlts for the ethanol blends are 
somewhat under tIO cents, compared to 45 cents 
for importee oil. But imported oil cuts heavily 
into Brazil's tight supply of foreign currency. 
The Brazilian ,overnment also levies a heavy 
gasoline tax to discoura,e consumption. 

In addition to the blend program, Brazil is now 
mOviDi ahead with a plan to begin inte,rating 
180 percent alcohol fueled vehlcl.. into the 
nation's transportation system. Pure alcohol 
fuel requires extensive automotive engine 
redesign. Some 773 ,overnment test vehicles 
have already logged 8,000,000 kilometers 
"under every possible condition." 

General Motors' 'Brazilian subsidiary 
recently modified a fleet oC buses to run on pure 
alcohol. Alcohol-powered Chevrolet pick-up 
trucks can be spotted rolling down the dirt roads 
which traverse the sugar cane plantations. 

Volkswagen, the giant of the Brazilian auto 
industry, will begin assembly line production of 
pure alcohol vehicles later this year. The cars 
will be produced at a massive Volkswagen plant 
on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, employing 42,000 
people. The plant, producing over a half million 
automobiles a year, has flooded the Brazilian 
roadways with Beetles, "Dashers and vans that 
run on the 10 percent blend, The alcohol-
powered engines average 18.5 miles per gallon 
and have more power than a gasoline engine of 
equivalent size VW reports. 

Brazilian ,overnments officials are phmning 
to use this new ,eneration of alcohol-powered 
vehicles to develop islands of agro-industry in 
the nation's vast interior. Lubricating oil and 
plastics derived from agricultural products 
could allow these new centers to develop without 
the aid of imported petroleum. 

Brazil's new minister of a,riculture, Antonio 
Delfim Netto, hopes that these new areas could 
help stem the flood of rural immigrants to the 
overcrowded cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro. • 

T he government is also trying to develop manioc, a starchy root crop cultivated 
Drimarily by the rural poor, as an alcohol 

source. Manioc, which is used to produce 
tapioca, grows well in mar,inal soill, can be 
harvested year round, and could provide a new 
source of Income for small farmers , If two 
percent of the nation's land mass was put into 
energy production. all of Brazil's annual liquid 
fuel needs couid be met by alcohol. 

The current ethanol expansion program has 
not come without a serious environmental cost. 
The nation's riverl are bein, used as dumping 
grounds for the "slop" by-product of sugar can 
distillation.

Pub Choice Disputed 
(Continued from page 1) 
-reports on Cadillac Cafe's 
ability to fulfill the esta blished 
criteria. According to Bennit 
"Cadillac Cafe would not hav~ 
experienced management." 
Bennett and Student Center 
Board Chair Rich Lapping say 
that Morrison, a UCSD senior, 
would be managilll the pub. 

Mo'rrison claims that 
Michael Dini, manager of 
Dlni's Bar in Del Mar "would 
be actively involved in 
management. .. 

Bennett claims that Dini has 
writ~n that he would not be 
involved in managing Cadillac 
Cafe. 

Morrison replies, " I'd sure 
like to ~e It (Dini's written 
statement) . " 

It is Morrison's claim that the 
selection of Goldy's was not 
based entirely on the 
established criteria. "If you 
compare the two bids, "ours is 
clearly superior." 

The purchasing office, 
responsible for the final 
decision against the Cadillac 
Cafe propoaal, was the subject 
of another of Morrison's 
allegations. 

A li.t of amendments made 
on the original Cadillac Cafe 
proposal, wblch included 

concessions required by 
purchasing, was " destroyed by 
someone in the department," 
said Morrison . 

Bennett claims she " never 
received any written amend-
ments," adding, "It's just his 
word against mine." 

Bennett also claims that no 
one in purchasing has any 
copies of the amendments. 

Lapping, though, says he 
never sent copies of the 
amendments to purchasing, 
which he personally assisted 
Morrison In writing. " The 
bidding had already been 
decided by that time," Lapping 
says . 

Bennett asserted that the 
amendments were irrelevant." 
Said Lapping, "If we had 
favored Morrison 's proposal, 
then we would have gone ahead 
and negotiated the contract. 

Morrison has threatened to 
present his claim to court and 
"let an impartial judge 
decide." 

Morrison claims that he has a 
legal precedent for an 
injunction. " We will inform the 
Judge that the decision was 
made before all the facts were 
known (In reference to the 
mlssiDJl amendments) ," said 
Morrison. "If an impartial 

judge evaluated our pro-
posal and Goldy's proposal, 
and each of our abilities to 
satisfy the criteria laid down by 
the selection committee, he 
would see that our proposal was 
clearly better. Also," added 
Morrison, " I could sue on the 
grounds that I am a student and 
I'm not getting a fair deal ." 

Future Foods, the natural 
(ood snack bar currently 
operating in Building C, also 
lost their bid for the pub but has 
reacted quite difCerently. 

" To tell you the truth," said 
co-owner Nadine Shaw , " I 
would have been shocked if we 
had gotten the bid." 

Gary Moser, of the pub 
subcommittee, said the 
committee eliminated their bid 
for the pub because "of their 
lack of pub management 
experience and because they 
wanted less conventional foods 
oCCered. They were gong to stay 
with natural foods and we felt 
that didn 't meet the needS ofthe 
students. We also had some 
complaints that their prices 
were too high. " 

Owners of Future Foods 
agreed that natural food was 
part of the problem. "Students 
view us more as a specialty 
store," said Shaw. 

James Baldwin, author and playwright, will give an 
informal talk at 7 pm Thursday, May 3, in the UCSD Thea~re. 

Baldwin, 54, Is Internationally known as a writer and a civil 
rights spokesman. His works include Go Tell It On The

UC May Sponsor Cronkite News Show

Sa llman said chances are 

" probably very high" that the 

high school students receive no 
news exposure and are in need 
of a nontraditiona l news 
program. 

Each ha lf-hour segment will 
be similar to CBS's weekly 
"MacNeil/Lehrer Report," 
Saltman said. 

A UC-spon ored national 
news show , to be hosted by 
CDS's Walter Cronkite, may air 
within two years if sufficient 
funding is obtained, accol'ding 
Lo Vice Chan~ellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Saltman. 

Kline. a long-time friend of 
Saltman's, contacted Saltman 
to discuss the possibility of 
developing the program with 
the niversity of California. 
Shortly thereafter, a partner-
ship was formed, said Saltman.

funding. however, could ruin 
hopes for the program, he 
added. Tenure Rally Today 

The news show will provide 
a nalysis fo r high sc hool 
stu dent s of " the most 
important news o( thatday," as 
discussed by guest speakers on 
the show, said Saltman. 

The program will be 
broadcast live via satellite 
from either Los Angeles or New 
York through the Public 
Broa dcasti ng System, sa id 
Saltman. 

A minimum of $3-4 million 
will be required to produce and 
air the shows each year, 
according to Sattman. Funding 
will be sought from founda-
tions, companies and banks, he 
said. 

Today 's rally against denial of tenure to four UCSD assistant 
professors sponsored by the Tl!l1ure Task Force, will feature 
Will Wright, who organized the original task force here from 
among students in his clas , before he was himself denied 
tenure. 

Cronkite and Bob Kline, 
owner o( a Los Angeles-based 
media and comm'unications 
center, conceived the idea of 
the news show several years 

UC Extension is handling 
many of the plans for the

"take the notion of Extension 
one step further ," he 
remarked and "should educate 

Stanley Aronowitz, professor at UC Irvine, and several 
students (rom the Tenure Task Force will also speak in the noon 
rally on the gym steps. 

UC Extension has developed 
programs dealing with 
secondary education in the 
past. According to Saltman, 

The rally will focus on the weight given in the tenure process 
to student evaluations, and on the problems of "progressive" 
professors, he said. The cases in controversy presently are

Saltman is Still 
'A Person" With 
All His Activities 

(Conlinued from page I) 
says he is not anxious to be " different" Crom others, although in 
many respects he is "not a conventional guy." 

"I'm radical when I deal with University Hall, " Saltman says. 
"I'm called crazy because I yell at (UC President David) Saxon. " 

Saltman also finds his "notion of shared responsibility" an 
unusual characteristic for an administrator. His daily and 
"candid" morning meetings with administrators are " not a 
common type oC relationship," he explains. 

Tired Blood and Rus&y Liven 
When Saltman finished his undergraduate work at Caltech, he 

left with misgivings about his past work in chemistry and 
prepared to begin graduate studies at Harvard Business School. 

Instead, he and his wife Barbara spent a year in Paris where 
Barbara modeled for Jacques Farth, and where Saltman "Cell in 
love with science again" and " really decided I wanted to become a 
biochemist," he recalls. 

Saltman returned to Caltech to earn his PhD in biology. Soon 
aCter he began teaching as an assistant proCessor at USC his 
interest in trace metal elements research began. 
. Now, nearly 22 years later, he "really worries" a bout ti red blood 
and rusty livers, Saltman says. 

Saltman's research has involved him in cultural studies of 
alcobolics and with powdered milk Cortification in Ourango, 
Mexico. 

In addition, hla reputation as a scientist has earned his 
appearance on sucb television programs as the "Dinah Shore 
Show" and an invitation to cbair a session at the International 
Conferenl!e on Proteins of Iron Metabolism in Davos, Switzerland, 
which he returned from recently. 

But perhaps Saltman's greatest passion is teaching. While at 
UCSD Saltman bas not missed a year in teaching biology to 
undergraduates. 

"I really love to teach," he says. "I've had a richness of students 
wbo have made my life a Cull one," In Cact, Saltman provides two 
chalkboards in bis otherwise artistically-decorated office which 
remain covered with equations and diagrams he draws Cor his 
students who take advantage oC his office hours. 

The Guardian 

No SacriCice 
Despite his many teaching and administ rative activities , 

Saltman has " never sacrificed anything" to make room for his 
responsibilities , he says. 

Saltman alway combines school with his family and ha never 
given up surfing, skiing or other activities , he say . 

Indeed, Saltman's athletics have helped prevent him from 
looking his 51 years. And if he does not explain the world through 
the second theory of thermodynamics, Saltman compares the 
rules of Hfe to a basketball game. 

" I never have tochange my mood," Saltman notes. "I don't need 
any syringes or drinks." 

In addition, Saltman finds time to be a " book junkie" and to 
listen to classical or jazz musiC. But the most important part of his 
liCe, he stresses, is his Camily. 

Not to be easily outdone by their father, Saltman's two sons have 
worked with filmmaking and Chinese studies. Barbara, with a 
reputation as an accomplished artist, returned two days ago Crom 
a trip to China, where she toured and collected art works. 

A Stranger to Students 

Saltman says that few students here know him. " I'm reaching 
out," he adds. " I go out to them when I have a class. " 

If students are reluctant to approach him because of 
intimidation, "that's their own cowardice," according toSaltman. 
" I'm not waiting for Godot. I am the number two man on the 
campus - come and get me! " 

A Sense of Independence 
Sallman is careCul to point out thdl he is his own man. ''I'm not 

beholden to this office," he says . " I 'm beholden to myself and to 
my wife." 

As a leader, he models himself after such figures as nob 
Hutchins from the University of Chicago and FDR. " I can't think 
oC any college presidents that I 'd like to be like," Saltman adds. 

Whatever commitment Saltman has toward UCSD, it ends " if 
the game changes." 

. "I'll fight to that point to where there 's more pain than 
pleasure," he explains. " It's like taking a dive into a Cight ... then 
my integrity is lost. " 

nut for the presentSaltman finds UCSD's " rulesof the game" to 
be Cair and feels that his work here has been successful. "If I get 
killed tomorrow," he says, "I would have no regrets. " 

To some, Saltman may seem, as one local newspaper dubbed 
him, "The Southern California kid - grown up bigger than life." 

Yet Saltman says he is " nol Big Daddy" and admits that on bad 
days his "Corces" are out of shape. " I only c0111e in one fl avor, in 
one shape, and that's Paul Saltman - a person," he says.

wood, which had brought an 
incredible revolution to surCers 
- the lightweight board. The 
navy needed balsa wood for life 
rafts, so Saltman and Bob 
Simmons, a Cal Tech dropout, 
lumped together pieces of 
styrofoam, sealing it with 
resined Ciberglass. 

Another brainstorm, the 
neoprene wetsuit, was invented 
by Saltman's Criend , Hugh 
Bradner, who is an AMES 
proCessor here. 

His idea though, was turned 
down by the Berkeley patent 
office, which said they could 
see no possible use for the suit. 
Since then, over '100,000 of 
Bradner's suits have sold. 

Bradner's suits were an 
improvement, Saltman says, 
over what was used beCore that 
- the cashmere sweater. 

Saltman, who claims to have 
surfed all over the coast, 
proudly points out that he is an 
original member of the San 
OnoCre Surf Club (number 45) . 
He remembers eight foot waves

six, no digestion whatsoever." 

The researchers concluded 
that with six or more Catty acid 
chains bonded to the " back-
bone" molecule, none of the 
material would be absorbed by 
the body. According to Grundy, 
this means that the eight-<!hain 
SPE "represents a sort of zero-
calorie 'fat' which can be used 
in place oC regular fat. .. 

In passing the SPE through 
the digestive system, the body 
also eliminates any cholesterol 
contained in the material. 
Grundy and Mattson detailed 
three mechanisms by which 

SPE lowers blood cholesterol 
levels. In addition to simply 
blocking absorption , the 
related weight loss, itself, has a 
cholesterol-lowering eCfect. 

" It 's welt known ," said 
Grundy, " that many patients 
with high cholesterol levels do 
have a lowering when they are 
started on weight reduction." 

The third mechanism 
involves replacing saturated 
fats with SPE. "Saturated fats 
are known to raise the blood 
cholesterol, " said Grundy . 
"This occurs independently of 
the cholesterol that is contained 
in the Cats," he added. 

One difficulty. the reo 
searchers encountered was the 
digestion of fal -spluble 
vitamins. Several vitamins -
A, D, E and K - are 
metabolized in the same 
manner as cholesterol. SPE

remedied , according to 
Grundy, simply by Increasing

these vitamins will be 
absorbed.

the seasoned veterans who can field and 
hit with the best of them, but look out for 
the infield of Bat of Hell who turned in 
the season's first tliple play Saturday. 
Greg Larsen, John Szewczyk, and Alan 
Vier turned in the 1-2-3 beauty in a 14-6 
win over the Sea Deucers. 

OuUleid Frank Vernon (Profoath-
letics) ulled to be the King of Swat at 
UCSD, but the emereence' of Input-
Outputs Bret Goldberg may shake up 
the old guard a bit . Goldberg is pushing 
a half dosen HRs In the first half of the 
season to belp last year's AA Champs in 
their transition to AAA. Vernon, 
meanwhile , between studyinl 
earthquakes in Mexico, has. reportedly 
purchased a palo grande in 
Guadalajara that ml,ht help him 
relain bls title. lUck VeUi plays a .wift 
centerfield for Coitus lntramuralls , but 
needs to improve his over-the-Iine 
swine before he can be rated as a true 
all-around softbull player. Ralph Nitkln 
(Biohazards) can hit prodigious shots 
with the best of them, but so far in '79 
he's come up dry. So has ProCoathletic 
rightfielder Dob Mulick who may have 
the best cannon in the league (when it 
comes to throwing the ball) .

Men Key Badminton Win 

Dean Scararoni dives back to the bag to avoid a pick-off 
attempt as the men's baseball team dropped a 5-3 decision to 
visiting Cal Baptist College Tuesday afternoon. 

The Tritons salvaged the third game of last week's Point 
Lorna series, win!)ing on Friday, 4-3. 

UCSD dropped a pair of one run decisions to the Crusaders 
earlier in the week. 

The team takes on Cal Lutheran at 12 noon on Saturday. in 
their final game of the season at Olsen Field. 

,.Itoto .y s,_ Ho .... 

For the second time in less 
than a week the Triton 
badminton team beat CSU Los 
Angeles, this time at the 
opponent's court last Saturday. 
9-6. 

Once agai n it was an 
excelle'nt showing by the men 
that captured the win (or the 
Tritons, m a king up for the 
weaker playing of the women 
against the powerful LA squad. 

Hal Jacobs, playing first 
men 's singles, edged past his 
opponent, 15-12, 15-10. Craig 
Turner, Mark Standlee and Jeff 
'Johnson all followed suit, easily 
defeating their Los Angeles 
riva ls . John Cox met Glenn 
Yangai in the number five slot, 
downing him, 15-6, 15-9. . 

Jacobs and Cox teamed up in 
the number one men's doubles 
slot to deleat Johnny Johnson 
and Mark Mikami, 15-5. 15-7. In 
one of the closer doubles 
matches of the day, Standlee 
and Turner outlasted their 
opponents, 15-8, 1(1-15, 15-3. 

For the women, it was 
another uphill struggle against 
the tough Los Angeles women's 
team. Lon Ta, at number one, 
lost her match against Doreen 
Gonzales. Ta set the first game 
and lost 1-3, lalling apart in the 
second game in a shutout, 11-0. 

Jane Orbuch put up a strong 
fight at number three in a losing 
effort, 11-5, 4-11, 4-1l.

King lasted for three games 
only to lose in the third, 15-7. 

Five mixed doubles teams 
were victorious including 
Turner and Fried who paired 
up for a tough three game

Tennis Women Shine 
By Pam Gold 

UCSD joined Stanford, 
UCLA, SDSU, and other big 
tennis schools at Ojai last 

• weekend, in a meeting of the 
most competitive women's 
collegiate tennis players 
offered in California. Two 
singles and one doubles team 
represented UCSD in this 
prestigious event, winning two 
out of lour matehes. 

Debbie Shapiro, falling prey 
to an unlucky draw, played 
Dana Gilbert in first round 
singles action. GObert, number 
one sineles player for UCLA, 
competes in the A von Futures 
and numerous professional 
competitions. Seeded second at 
Ojai, she beat Shapiro 6-1,6-1. 

According to CQach Pat 
Stewart, " The draw didn't do 
justice to Debbie's ability." 

In an easy first round, Cecilia 

Kavanaugh won a no contest 
match against Mary Beth 
Swanson of Cal Lutheran, 11-1, 6-
2. She confronted Lucy Gordon, 

. another . prominent UCLA 
player, two hours later. In their 
last meeting a couple of years 
ago, Kavanaugh was vic-
torious. This time however, 
Gordon, armed ' Cor battle, 
triumphed 6-0, 6-3. Gordon. 
whose father started the 
Bishop's tennis school in La 
Jolla , does credit to her father 's 
name . . 

The doubles team of Beth 
Alley and Amy Odland met 
Occidental in their opening 
match, winning in a 6-3, 6-3 
bout. The pair fell to Cal State 
Northridge 3-6, 5-7 in a tough 
second round effort. 

The Ojai tournament 
concluded the 1979 tennis 
season for the UCSD women.

Music/Ted Burke 

At Jazz Fest, Two Ways to be Brainy 
P ianist Art Lande and Rubisa Patrol opened 

last Sunday's matinee 
concert of The La Jolla Jazz 
Festival with the most self-
consciously academic jazz 
soUnds I've heard since the 
artsy West Coast movement of 
the Fifties and Sixties. Like the 
artists that typified that style, 
such as Dave Bruebeck. 
Gunther Schiller and the 
Modem Jazz Quartet. Lande 
and group weren't afraid to 
exhibit their schooled know-
how. At times, the ensemble 
seemed bogged down by an 
overdose of collegiate cuteness. 

Their first song. for example. 
sounded like a textbook of 
musical styles and approaches. 
an I extended melange that 
grouped Strauss-like waltz · 
tempos. Ivesian multi-toned 
chaos, Cagesian "chance 
music," minimalism. Omette . 
Coleman's forays into serial 
composition, and so forth. into 
the same piece. The overall 
effect of the piece. to be 
expected. didn't hold together 
over the ground It attempted to 
stretch across. but the playing 
talent of the musicians was 
UDdeDIabl •• Lande bimaelf was 
comfortable crlucroulng style 
to style. motif to motif, leaving 
one 'wlth the final Impression 
that his piano work is a strange 
marriage between Art Tatum, 
Chopin and Thelonlos Monk. 
Trumpeter Mark Isham had an 
agile but ultimately cold style 
that never connected to the 
pulsating nerve of some of the 
more up-tempo, mainstream 
material. and saxophonist 
Bruce Williamson was heard 
{rom too little. The few solos he 
too][ seemed fully developed 
and excellently phrased with an 
assured timbre. but his main 
duties, which seemed to be 
staying in the background and 

playing the charts. adding fills, 
'and such. kept him from 
establishing any lasting 
charisma. The rhythm section 
of drummer Bill Douglas and 
drummer Kurt Wortman did 
their chores superbly .

interplay even through the 
most convoluted arrange-
ments. As they are now, Lande 
and Rublsa Patrol seem 
abounding with ideas and are 
capable of supplying much job. 
Their cleverness tended to be 
'cloying overall in this concert. 
however. All they need is a little 
graininess, a rough edge to 
their sound to make their 
deliberate ingenuity more 
humane. I look forward to their 
next San Diego appearance to 
see if any changes have been 
made in the total sound. 

Air was another case 
altogether. While at first listen 
the trio's sound seems coldly 
cerebral and the secret to 
erijoying them seems locked in

lar) , Air's otherwise ethereal 
imprOvisations have a tangible 
gut . a sense of muted 
emotionalism that transcends 
the discussions of technique 
and aesthetic stance and 
speaks as' directly to an 
audience as any other kind of 
jazz is able to. 

Like Ornette Coleman at his 
ground breaking peak ' or Miles 
Davis in the late Sixties, Air 
deals in atonal cadences, 
angulated logistics and 
fractured tempos that seem to 
hopscotch all over the place. 
Air. however. swings. thanks in 
no small part to drummer Steve 
McCall. Where most "free-
jazz" drummers (as this kind of 
music is invaribly called) 

. eliminate any trace of big-band 

or be-bop finesse and assert 
their rhythmic ab tractions 
with blunt, nerve shattering 
bursts and explosions, McCall

smooth snare rolls. hand-ove r-
hand combinations

crystal clear cymble reports. 
fusing his poly rhythmic 
conceptions with the shameless

McCall, however. is not scene-
stealer and proved himself to 
be endlessly malleable in the 
trio. giving that needed push to 
bassist Fred Hopkins and-
saxophonist Henry Threadgill. 
Threadgill was a delight 
throughout the band's set. 
someone who seems to have 
assimilated the entire history 
of saxophone improvs and 
comes out with a style that 
blends them all into something 
brand new and unique. Like 
Arthur Blythe. Threadgill's 
playing has a warm under-
current even during his most

and he can alternate amazingly 
long lines with sparkling . 
sustained harmonics . Hopkins 
on bass was something of a 
quiet virtuoso. steady. fast, 
resourceful yet never ob-
trusive. In totem, Air as a trio 
played more music than half 
the bands twice their size. 

Between Lande and Air was 
poet David Henderson, who did 
a twenty-minute reading from 
his work. Henderson has a 
knack for images that hit hard 
and fast and displays a sense 
for place that evokes every 
smell . sight and sound of the 
place he's writing about. The 
most effective pieces were a 
selection ca lled "Midnight," 
from his biography. Jimi 
Hendrix : Vuodoo Child of the 
Aquarian Age, and a poem 
about Thelonious Monk visiting 
a bar called "The Count Basie 
Lounge" in Harlem. In both 
selections. he came closer to 
the essences of both musicians-
than anything I've read about 
them elsewhere.
