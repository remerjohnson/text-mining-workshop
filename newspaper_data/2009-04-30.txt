The A.S. Council’s decision last 
week to keep the Grove Caffe open 
was voided when the A.S. Judicial 
Board ruled Tuesday that the ver-
dict was reached using incorrect 
procedure. 

Councilmembers voted against 
discontinuing Grove opera-
tions under the assumption that 
a two-thirds majority was neces-
sary to approve the legislation. A.S. 
President Donna Bean immediately 
contested that only a simple major-
ity should have been necessary.

Fifteen councilmembers voted 
in favor of the legislation, while 11 
voted against it. A simple-majority 
voting system would have resulted 

in the  Grove’s closure.
The board reached its decision 

after reviewing Robert’s Rules of 
Order Newly Revised, the council’s 
primary document of parliamen-
tary conduct. According to Judicial 
Board Chair Stephen Juarez, the 
vote should have depended only 
on a simple majority. The board 
has five days from its decision on 
Tuesday to release its official state-
ment on the matter.

Given the option of reconsider-
ing the legislation at a meeting last 
night, councilmembers moved to 
table the revote until May 6 after a 
debate arose over the finality of the 
Judicial Board’s decision.

Although San Diego County 
health officials announced that more 
confirmed cases of swine flu should 
be expected within days, UCSD’s 
Student Health Services has not yet 
reported any incidences.

“We have been testing students 
who have flu symptoms as well as 
fever, and all have tested negative,” 
SHS Medical Director Gina Fleming 
said.

On Wednesday, SHS stopped test-
ing students with mild flu symptoms 
in favor of testing only the seriously 
ill. Current precautions include put-
ting students exhibiting flu symptoms 
in a separate area in the waiting room 
and providing them with masks to 
prevent the spread of germs. 

“The San Diego County Health 
Department has made the recom-
mendation that we only test people 
who have symptoms so severe that we 
are considering hospitalizing them,” 
Fleming said early Wednesday morn-
ing.

SHS’s Urgent Care clinic saw an 
average number of student visitors 
Monday, but an unusually high per-
centage reported having sore throats 
and colds, Fleming said.

With five confirmed and 
three suspected cases 
in San Diego County, 
California declares a 
state of emergency.

Don’t hold your breath.After two years of picking through details, the commit-tee tasked with updating UCSD’s 28-year-old policy on “speech, advocacy and distribution of literature” has once 
again postponed its deadline for completion. 

The committee first pushed the release of its draft from May 1 
to seventh week, due to lingering disagreements about phrasing. 
Then, earlier this week, vice chancellors Steven W. Relyea and 
Penny Rue instructed committee chair and Associate Controller 
Sally Brainerd to hold onto the policy until fall 2009, when a 
public input period will finally commence. 

Brainerd said the timeline would have dangerously resem-
bled that of a similar scenario in spring 2007. The speech-policy 
committee at the time, chaired by Sports Facilities Manager Don 
Chadwick, released a controversial policy proposal during finals 
week. The changes were sent campuswide in an e-mail titled 
“Review of PPM 510-1 Section IX.”

It was met with immediate uproar from students and faculty 
who felt the administration was trying to sneak the restrictions 
past public review. The American Civil Liberties Union argued in a 
letter to the university that a whopping 10 aspects of the policy were 
unconstitutional, including a clause stating that any event or gathering 
that could “reasonably be expected to attract a crowd of 10 or more 
people” would require a reservation.

Benjamin Balthaser, Graduate Student Association representative 
on the current committee, was among those who participated in an 
emergency rally outside former Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson’s office. Second-year John Vasquez dedicated www.
ucsdfreespeech.com to keeping students informed about the policy.

According to Balthaser and committee member and Director of 
Student Policies and Judicial Affairs Tony Valladolid, there has been 
speculation that the controversial restrictions drafted by the first 
committee were partly in response to campus disruptions at the time, 
including antiabortion demonstrations and protests over changes in 
Thurgood Marshall College’s Dimensions of Culture curriculum.

Brainerd said the former speech-policy committee was given 

According to the current draft
of the new speech policy, 
the following zones would only 
permit electronically ampliﬁ ed 
speech between certain times. 
Otherwise, electronic devices 
could be used in any area, as 
long as the the speaker is 150 
feet from an occupied building. 
No on-campus expression would 
be permitted to exceed 90 
decibels.

“It is possible that this has been 
around for a while and that we may 
see more cases just because we’re now 
looking for it,” Fleming said. “That 
doesn’t necessarily mean it’s ‘spread-
ing’, but that we are just ‘seeing’ what’s 
already been there.”

There have been five confirmed 
cases in the county. All reports have 
been mild in nature, and those infect-
ed have made full recoveries. 

Three probable cases have also 
been reported. The most recent was 
a San Diego State University stu-
dent, announced late Tuesday night. 
City officials are awaiting Centers for 
Disease Control test results to con-
firmed the three cases as swine flu.

The previous Tuesday, a 10-year-
old boy was the first to be infected 
with the virus in San Diego County. 

Since then, laboratory testing 
through the CDC has confirmed 
cases of swine flu in a 54-year-old 
man and his 16-year-old daughter, 
a 7-year-old boy and a 20-year-old 
man.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
declared a state of emergency on 
Tuesday, and California became the 
first state to begin performing in-
state laboratory testing instead of 
sending samples to the CDC labora-
tory in Atlanta.

Meanwhile, the White House 
requested $1.5 billion from Congress 
to fight the outbreak by producing 
more antiviral drugs and working on 
a vaccine specific to swine flu. 

The virus has hit 11 states and 
eight countries. There are 14 con-
firmed and 17 probable cases in 
California. 

The swine flu outbreak originat-
ed in Mexico, and the only fatal-
ity from swine flu outside of Mexico 
— a 23-month-old Mexican toddler 
visiting Texas — was confirmed 
Wednesday morning.

At the UCSD Medical Center, 
staff members are taking extra pre-
cautions to prevent the flu from 
spreading.

“We prepare all year round for 
these types of emergencies,” UCSD 
Medical Center spokeswoman Jackie 
Carr said. “We drill to make sure we 
are ready in the event that something 
like this takes place. … We aren’t 
wearing masks at the moment, but 
we are making sure that everyone is 
washing their hands carefully, espe-
cially every single time following a 
sneeze or cough, wiping down hospi-
tal surfaces and screening all patients 

for signs of flu.”
Infected patients have been treat-

ed with Tamiflu and Relenza, the only 
medications to which the virus is cur-
rently responding.

“Stocks of Tamiflu and other med-
ications are available, and we do have 
access to the stock when the time is 
right,” Carr said. “They will be dis-
tributed strategically based on where 
and when cases evolve.” 

San Diego County Health and 
Human Services Agency senior med-
ical consultant Dr. Nick Yphantides 
said CDC released 25 percent of the 
storage units of antiviral medications 
with first priority to parts of the 
country where there have been con-
firmed cases.

Crescenzo at sdecresc@ucsd.edu.

wished to hold the revote at last night’s 
meeting, others asserted that the 
council should wait until the board’s 
official statement on the issue before  
voting once more on the legislation.

Others said the vote should be 
taken only after members of the 
public had been notified that the 
legislation was being reconsidered.

“How can we go ahead and talk 
on this when there’s no one else here 
to have this discussion with?” Vice 
President of Finance and Resources 
Naasir Lakhani said.

Similarly, Sixth College Senator 
John Cressey said the council should 
wait until the Grove’s student man-
agers were present to vote on the 
legislation.

“Give them the dignity of seeing 
what happens, in person, to the place 

they spend all their time,” Cressey 
said. 

Cressey, along with several other 
councilmembers, added that the 
legislation should be reopened for 
discussion, given the controversy 
surrounding the voting process. 

However, others on the coun-
cil — among them Associate Vice 
President of Student Advocacy 
Frank Carroll and AVP Academic 
Affairs Lana Blank — said the leg-
islation should not be reopened for 
discussion since the Judicial Board’s 
decision only nullified the results of 
the vote, not the deliberation that 
preceded it.

“They didn’t throw out the dis-
cussion. … What they threw out was 
the vote,” Carroll said.

Speaker Jordan Taylor added that 
the vote was not being reopened, 

but rather that an entirely new vote 
was coming before the council.

“This isn’t a reopening of the 
vote,” Taylor said. “It’s as if we 

haven’t had a vote on this.”

Most of the public input peri-od at last night’s council meeting was dominated by 
members of Students for Justice in 
Palestine, who expressed concern that 
President Donna Bean and President-
elect Utsav Gupta were planning on 
attending an annual convention spon-
sored by the American Israel Public 
Affair Committee. 

Several students asked Bean and 
Gupta not to attend, stating that they 
would be representing the student 
body and risked dividing the univer-
sity community.

Both Gupta 
and Bean defend-
ed their right to 
attend the confer-
ence as individu-
als who wanted 
to learn about 
the issues surrounding the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict rather than as 
student representatives. 

“I’m going to educate myself on 
the issues,” Bean said. “I hope there’s 
enough trust that I will not be brain-
washed.”

University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino addressed the concern the 
council expressed at its last meeting 
that University Centers and UCAB 
would replace the Grove Caffe with a 
corporate business. 

“We’re careful and concerned 
about the vibe of the Student Center,” 
he said. 

Thurgood Marshall senior Kath 
Rogers gave a presentation encourag-
ing the council to pass a resolution 
that would call for the university to 
use only cage-free eggs. 

Koala Editor-in-Chief Kris 
Gregorian attended the meeting to 
defend his travel-funding request of 
$400 to attend the Second United 
Comedy Knowledge Organizational 
Field Forum (S.U.C.K.O.F.F.), a com-

edy conference. In response to the 
council’s request last week that he 
provide additional documentation 
about the conference, he suggested 
that the council was being biased in 
its demands. 

“I gave you all the documentation 
there is,” he said. ”If I give you any 
more, it’s gonna be made up.” 

The council voted to allocate the 
funds. 

Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Frank Carroll then made 
a special presentation to confront 

allegations made 
by Academic 
I n t e g r i t y 
C o o r d i n a t o r 
Tricia Bertram-
Gallant that he 
had presented 
factual errors in a 

March 9 Guardian article. 
Carroll suggested that AIC has 

emboldened professors to pursue 
cases of academic misconduct that 
should not be pursued, said that the 
office failed at being transparent and 
pointed out that physics professor 
Michael Anderson brought forth 82 
of the 466 allegations of student mis-
conduct.

“There is something critically 
wrong with this office,” he said. “It 
worries me, but it doesn’t worry the 
administration, which worries me. 
I’m a very worried person.”

The Grove Caffe question was 
again tabled since some councilmem-
bers believed that the public had not 
been adequately notified that they 
would be voting again after last week’s 
vote was nullified by the A.S. Judicial 
Board. 

Much new and unfinished busi-
ness was tabled until next week’s 
meeting so that councilmembers 
could attend the Death Cab for Cutie 
concert at RIMAC Arena.

the job of changing the policy simply 
to update outdated references.

“There was no ulterior motive,” 
Brainerd said. “It was just — work.”

A team of students including 
Balthaser and the two original under-
graduate representatives on the com-
mittee — who have since been replaced 
by A.S.-appointed James Baldwin and 
Erin Brodwin — composed their ideal 
policy, then got the thumbs up from 
the A.S. Council, GSA and the ACLU.

An extended and fiery pub-
lic-review period made it clear the 
“draconian” policy would have to be 
canned completely, and administrators 
put Brainerd at the helm of the new 
committee. Her team, which retained 
Associate Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Gary R. Ratcliff and UCSD Police 
Department Lt. Dave Rose from the 
original committee, planned to assess 
students’ suggestions and draw up a 
more popular policy.

Balthaser said arguments over lan-
guage in the student draft made for 
slow progress during the first year — 
until Ratcliff presented his own draft.

“I think what was stalling the com-
mittee for a long time is basically the 
administration didn’t want to flat-out 
reject the policy, but they didn’t want 
to endorse it either; so the committee 
basically just didn’t do anything for a 
long time,” Balthaser said. “We actu-
ally requested that they write their own 
draft, because they obviously weren’t 
responding to ours. So when Gary 
brought his draft, it was like — of 
course that’s what they wanted.”

Committee member and Campus 
Counsel Dan Park said the biggest 
improvement in the new policy is its 
larger degree of student input.

“Basically, the current draft has 
been mostly written by the students on 
the committee,” he said.

Balthaser, however, said the pre-
amble is almost all that remains of the 
student version.

“[Our draft] got completely dis-
missed,” he said. “There are some 
things that are still in it, but mostly just 
rhetoric.”

Baldwin said Ratcliff and Park’s 
policy preferences best represent those 
of the administration.

Both, he explained, have consis-
tently expressed that “daily business 
of the university is paramount and 
needs to be maintained at all costs; 
that stability is more important than 
anything else.”

Park said protecting university 
function is equally important to pro-
tecting freedom of expression.

At a March meeting, Brodwin told 
the committee that she didn’t think 
students’ wishes were being considered 
as heavily as administrators’.

Balthaser said the most recent delay 
is due to an emergency meeting set for 
next week which Rose called to discuss 
a line in the preamble that reads: “… 
Such restrictions shall be enacted in 
the least restrictive manner possible.”

“His argument is that [“least restric-
tive”] is redundant ... He also doesn’t 
like it because it puts a very high 
standard on police behavior,” Balthaser 
said. “And I kind of like having a very 
high standard on police behavior. I 
think that’s very good.”

Rose declined an interview.
“I imagine several issues will be 

discussed [at the meeting],” he said in 
an e-mail. 

Ratcliff said repeatedly that one key 
to ensuring that the policy is enforced 
consistently will be the line in the 
preamble specifying it be done in the 
“least restrictive manner possible.”

The current draft, which Brainerd 
said is nearly finished, only allows 
UCSD affiliates to use electronic 
amplified sound without a reservation 
during time slots that vary depending 
on the area. The times were chosen by 
the administrators who oversee the 
campus’ various open spaces. 

“We have a very large campus and 

a lot of people have a lot of ownership 
over their spaces,” Rue said.

Though the 1981 policy was more 
restrictive in that it included the use 
of nonelectronic devices in its defini-
tion of amplified sound, each zone was 
assigned the generally lengthier and 
more uniform time slot of 11:30 a.m. to 
2 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on week-
ends for all unreserved demonstrations.

Ratcliff, who compiled the varying 
time slots, said that he encouraged 
administrators to adhere to a more 
unified schedule.

Valladolid said the new time slots 
would be “extremely difficult” to 
enforce.

“All of us are concerned with the 
inconsistent time frame,” he said.

However, several committee mem-
bers expressed satisfaction with the 
new 90-decibel limit for amplified 
sound — the point at which it can injur 
the human ear — as a concrete way to 
enforce productive expression. In order 
to enforce the policy in a consistent and 
unbiased manner, Valladolid said that 
police will always ask a demonstrator to 
consider not interfering with the aca-
demic mission of the university before 
any additional action is taken.

Rue — who oversees the commit-
tee, along with Relyea — read a copy of 
the draft two weeks ago, and returned 
it to Brainerd with comments.

“That was to the committee, so 
that’s not public input,” Rue said.

She added that it’s not the right 
time for her to be “pre-judging” the 
committee’s work.

Brainerd said she could not com-
ment on the vice chancellor’s input 
because she had not yet been able to 
decipher Rue’s handwriting.

“I’m sorry, I couldn’t read it!” she 
said. “I haven’t had the time to go 
through it with Gary and say, ‘Now, 
what is that word?’”

The views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the opinions of the UCSD Guardian, the University of California or Associated Students.

As UCSD’s own speech-policy-committee tortoise rounds the final corner in 
its two-year policy-revision quest, 
this board is left wondering: Just 
what is the moral of this story?   

The committee’s current draft — 
all but finalized and forwarded to 
the university powers that be, save 
for a final emergency meeting next 
week — largely protects students’ 
constitutional freedoms. 

But it’s muddied with arbitrary 
limitations and ingrained with 
inconsistencies that the committee 
should have been more proactive in 
overcoming. 

Although nowhere near as 
draconian as the controversial 
2007-proposed policy, the current 
draft’s amplified sound zones rel-
egate electrically amplified sound 
in many campus hubs, usually to a 
random two-hour window. The rea-
soning behind these limits? 

It depends who you ask. 
According to committee members, 
the amplified-sound windows are 
an unsolvable mystery; because the 
areas are governed independently 
by their respective directors, those 
officials are allowed to determine 
the window. 

According to student represen-
tatives Erin Brodwin and James 
Baldwin, Associate Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff acted 
as a liaison to these various campus 
departments and led the commit-
tee to believe that these times were 
etched in stone. 

But the directors — mainly 
college provosts and deans — are 
equally unsure of how their appar-

ently arbitrary windows were cho-
sen. Their reasons varied from 
accommodating campus lunchtime 
and not disrupting administra-
tive meetings to following the way 
things have always been. 

Except that the recent draft’s 
amplified sound zones have nothing 
to do with how things have always 
been — each varies from the policy 
currently on the books. And that’s 
hardly the point anyway. 

The committee recognizes how 
random the windows are, and has 
gone so far as to include a recom-
mendation for standardized times 
along with their policy draft. But 
their entire draft is a recommenda-
tion, one that will be reviewed by 
campus higher-ups, then students, 
staff and faculty and revised again 

before it’s adopted. And the purpose 
of this committee was to propose a 
substantial policy revision. 

So why were committee mem-
bers so unwilling to override a 
handful of area directors? Or even 
speak with them to get to the bot-
tom of these windows and lobby 
for the standardized time — or no 
limit at all — that they apparently 
support? 

It’s admittedly hard to get a hold 
of those people, but it’s also the larg-
est unresolved element of a policy 
the committee’s been working on 
for two years. 

What’s more concerning is that 
the motivation for these amplified 
sound zones seems to be saving uni-
versity administrators from disrup-
tion. But Chancellor Marye Anne 

Fox’s desire for a quiet meeting 
shouldn’t trump students’ freedom 
of speech in a neighboring public 
space. 

Rather than instinctively want-
ing to avoid noise, administrators 
should embrace campus protest 
and lively discussion  — listening 
to students is worth a brief meeting 
interruption. There’s such a meek 
campus history of people trying to 
use amplified sound, carving such 
dramatic regulations in stone is an 
overreaction.

Ultimately this is just one mis-
step in an overall less-restrictive 
policy. But if students can take any-
thing from this lengthy tale, it’s that 
they should keep a watchful eye 
when this policy finally crosses the 
public-input finish line.

Since 1996, the Los Angeles Timeshas sponsored an annual book festival where authors, publish-
ers and religious nuts hock their wares 
in endless rows of small, white tarp 
tents. While representatives from the 
L.A. Times usually spend the festival 
basking in Pulitzer-fueled accolades 
from their fans, this year’s staffers faced 
increasingly pointed questions about 
the future of their paper. 

“How long are you guys going to 

stay in business?” “Have you closed 
your Washington bureau?” “Can an 
online-only paper make enough money 
to stay afloat?” 

Smiling a little too widely, L.A. Times
luminaries such as columnist Steve 
Lopez and blogger Geoff Boucher spoke 
in reassuring, dulcet tones about online 
advertising revenue and the paper’s con-
tinued commitment to the community. 

Regardless of the L.A. Times’ happy-
go-lucky posturing, newspapers like 
the L.A. Times and their ilk, sometimes 
referred to as “old media” because they 
began before the advent of the Internet, 
are being eclipsed by “new media” tools 
such as blogs, social networks and 
upstart news sites.

While no one is disputing the need 
for trained journalists, many would 
rather get their information about, say, 
rock climbing, from a rock-climbing 
blogger than a L.A. Times’ journal-
ist that has researched the topic for a 
month or so. While the rock climber 
may have poor grammar, misspellings 
or even a run-on sentence, their speci-
fied knowledge will probably prove 
more helpful than an article in which 
the reporter interviewed the climber 
and then related it, however lyrically, 
second-hand in the morning’s paper.

While online news sites are often 
perceived as a democratization of infor-
mation, one problem with Internet cov-
erage is that bloggers almost always 
begin writing to promote their per-
sonal biases. If you are so passion-
ate about a particular topic, you are 
probably not planning on delivering 
neutral content. In rock climbing, this 
is fine. When covering politics, how-
ever, this can encourage voters to seek 
out viewpoints similar to theirs instead 
of hearing the other side’s arguments, 
leading to an even more extreme par-
tisan divide.

But, just because the Web spews 
a stream of constant misinformation, 
biased diatribes and personal rants, 
doesn’t mean that it can’t become a 
legitimate vehicle for timely informa-
tion. While some more traditional 
sources may be, ahem, a little less “fair 
and balanced” than others, we gener-
ally assume that we’re not being fed a 
pack of lies. Online news sites with no 
prior brand to build on face the chal-
lenge of trying to be taken as seriously 
as, say, the New York Times.

News sites that practice what has 
been termed “hyperlocal journalism,” 
in that they focus exclusively on one 
geographic location, are gaining hold 
as a viable replacement model for the 
print papers that are in severe eco-
nomic straits as they attempt to cover 
global news. But hyperlocal sites will

Though you may have been wowed by the eucalyptus groves and weird art during 
your first starry-eyed trek across 
UCSD, dealing with a regular stu-
dent’s routine has probably brought 
two things to your attention: 1) our 
parking sucks and 2) getting across 
campus on foot takes way too long 
— often resulting in tardiness and 
unattractive armpit stains.

So you’ve probably found ways 
to cope with transportation woes 
— whether that means catching the 
shuttle loop on your way to class, 
cramming into the Regents shuttle 
or playing car stalker in Gilman 
Parking Structure — and gotten 
over it. But after the Transportation 
Policy Committee met last week 
to brainstorm new funding solu-
tions for campus transit services, 
our transportation lifelines are now 
on the chopping block. 

In a month, the committee will 
respond to student input by recom-
mending either a $50 user fee, a 
campuswide $15 student transpor-
tation fee or the reduction of cam-
pus services. 

In making this decision we must 
resist our inner sloth and think 
about our priorities: sustainabil-
ity, university access and afford-
able options. We must safeguard the 
Arriba and Regents shuttles — lines 
that benefit commuter students by 
reducing eco-impact — and cut lux-
uries like campus loop. 

Campus loop’s four shuttles cost 
$400,000 annually. Although that 
money might seem like chump 
change in comparison to Parking 
and Transportation Services’ annual 
$7 million expenses, it’s the prin-
ciple of our transportation spending 
that’s important. While campus loop 

may be a convenient service, its 
limited route and meandering pace 
hardly offer a time-efficient or eco-
friendly way to get around campus. 

Acquainting students with alter-
nate forms of transportation is the 
first step to weaning us from fossil 
fuels. That’s why P&TS should drop 
the gas-guzzling loop and introduce 
campus bike-rental services.

Transportation directors could 
base a campuswide program on 
already existing services — like the 
Why Not Here? Lounge’s bike lend-
ing program in Revelle College — to 
speed up on-campus travel while 
staying true to its sustainable goals. 
Not only would vehicle maintenance 
be cheaper and our air cleaner, but 
the student body could burn off 
those Burger King visits with a little 
cardio, too. 

Students who are disabled or 
injured wouldn’t be left out either. 

Once they sign up for Americans 
with Disabilities Act transport ser-
vices, they’re offered weekday van 
pickups and point-to-point campus 
cart transport. 

It’s true that while starting up 
a bike lender program might help 
change student viewpoints about 
transportation — encouraging stu-
dents to bike to school altogether — 
it won’t fund the university’s grow-
ing public transportation expenses. 
So if push comes to shove and we’re 
forced to choose between instituting 
a user-based or a campuswide fee, 
students should pick the latter.

By pitching in to ensure our pub-
lic transit accessible and affordable, 
we’d be taking responsibility for our 
environmental impact and encour-
aging students to continue com-
muting. Keeping public transport 
fees low is also essential; if students 
aren’t riding the bus to spare the air, 

they’re most definitely doing it to 
save cash.

And who knows, with bikes and 
buses at their fingertips, maybe the 
auto-hermits will leave their cars at 
home and try to get their campus-
wide fee’s worth.

always be limited. This model should 
be seen as just one of the many aspects 
of a whole new world of ways to read 
about events.

Proponents of specific business 
models — whether it be citizen jour-
nalists, or nonprofits — must recog-
nize printed newspapers will not be 
replaced by another, single model. We 
saw citizen journalism in play when 
a plane crash-landed in the Hudson 
River, which was first reported by a 
local man on Twitter. While this can’t 
be a replacement for traditional news-
papers, it does provide useful supple-
mentary, firsthand information.

An example of the nonprofit broad-
cast model succeeding in the news 
arena is Voiceofsandiego.org, a non-
profit daily news site that began pub-
lishing in 2005 with funding from com-
munity members. Reporters at the site 
were recently awarded an important 
industry recognition award for top-
notch investigative journalism, after 
uncovering widespread financial cor-
ruption among two local redevelop-
ment agencies. The reporters at this 
site adhere to a code of journalism that 
gives readers incentive to take their 
stories as a balanced view of any issue. 
Thankfully, the reporting they’ve done 
on the issues has led to the exposure 
of financial misdeeds occurring right 
under our noses.

Do you want someone to monitor 
your politicians? Or, would you rather 
do it yourself? In choosing a new busi-
ness model, you should ask yourself why 
journalism exists in the first place. Even 
if you live in Washington D.C., your 
nine-to-five probably doesn’t come with 
days off to explore exactly what those 
guys in the White House are doing. 
Thanks to journalists, you don’t have to.

The problem with supporters of 
new media models who say that estab-
lishment papers must go is that with 

them goes the funding for news bureaus 
outside of New York. The investigative 
reporting being done at daily sites like 
Voiceofsandiego.org is clearly superior, 
but they will never have an overseas 
reporter in Baghdad. New models will 
need to address this area once so capa-
bly covered by large media organiza-
tions. Newspapers are on their way out, 
but we need to make sure we don’t 
discard journalism along with them.

Fortunately, as Marc Cooper, a pro-
fessor at the University of Southern 
California Annenberg School for 
Communication, remarked at the L.A. 
Times event, technologies don’t simply 
disappear because people become inter-
ested in other, newer inventions. As he 
aptly put it, fountain pens are no longer 
used for regular correspondence, but 
they’re certainly still easy to find. 

While I won’t be flipping through one 
newspaper over breakfast, I will receive 
news on a periodic basis throughout the 
day, whether it’s from a political site, blog 
or Twitter feed. This news is going to 
need to be reliable and timely.

This way, when a plane crash-lands 
in the Hudson, I won’t be spitting out 
my coffee in shock the next morning 
when I read the headline. I’ll know 
minutes after it occurs, and I’ll be able 
to add to the conversation if I’m in 
the area or have first-hand knowledge 
about the event through the comments 
section on my news site of choice.

As I listened to a panel discuss 
its innovative news projects from 
an entertainment Web site compet-
ing with the Hollywood Reporter,  to 
the award-winning site in my college’s 
hometown, one thing became clear: 
No one has any idea what the next big 
model of information distribution is 
going to be. And these people are the 
head honchos of the media world. If 
they aren’t sure what’s next, then we 
have a long Internet highway ahead of 
us until we figure it out.

Dear Editor,
UCSD’s e-mail to students sup-

porting Proposition 1A failed to 
mention that it’s a tax increase. In 
fact, the word “tax” doesn’t appear in 
the e-mail at all.

In reality, Proposition 1A is a $16 
billion tax hike that will increase 
income and sales taxes, nearly double 
the car tax and raise taxes for parents. 
Proposition 1A supporters know they 
can only win by waging a deceptive 
campaign that hides the fact that vot-
ing yes on proposition 1A is voting in 
favor of $1,100 in additional taxes for 
the average family of four.

Students attend UCSD to gain an 
education that will lead to a career in 

the field of their choice. But recent 
tax increases have made California 
the nation’s highest-taxed state. A 
delegation from the state Assembly 
recently visited Reno, Nev., to learn 
why our jobs and productive citizens 
are leaving.

Proposition 1A takes us in the 
wrong direction. The higher taxes 
will cost us more jobs and further 
erode our tax base. If regular people 
have to tighten their belts when they 
face challenging times, politicians 
should too. It is time for the politi-
cians to end the waste, fraud and 
abuse that have gone on too long.

Students also attend college to 
learn to think for themselves. Instead 
of sending an e-mail telling students 
what to think about Proposition 1A, 
perhaps it would have been more 
appropriate to send an e-mail with 

links to information from both sides 
so students could consider all points 
of view and then make up their own 
minds. The “no” campaign can be 
found at noproposition1a.com.

FOLLOWING DEATH CAB INTO THE DARK
QUARTET OF CUTIES DREAMS HARDER THAN THE SANDMAN ON NYQUIL

R IMAC is screaming. It’s 9:45 p.m. and the lights just went black — thousands of students wait, as a blue light pulses, cam-
eras at the ready, eyes on the empty stage 
filling fast with clouds of purple smoke.

“Hey, what’s going on,” Ben Gibbard 
says, leaping forward as Death Cab for 
Cutie slams into place and Nick Harmer 
pulls a pounding bass buzz into the ring. 
“405” soars over the freeway but expires 
at the crowd, shimmering like a heat 
wave and just as intangible. It’s so easy to 
start with a SoCal song — Gibbard hits 
the high notes with angelic clarity — but 
it’s harder to stop traffic. 

Organ-pounding drumbeats save 
them, bringing it back to the body on 
“Your Heart Is An Empty Room.” Every 
swooning fangirl knows it (and the guys 
all hum it under their breath), but the 
lingering lyric is “possibilities.” Death 
Cab’s giving us too much to think about 
— a too-short guitar solo and Gibbard’s 
long, flappy locks distracting even as he 
channels Cobain.

So the mob murmurs. Cameras 
take a back seat as fans wait, nervously, 
for the moment worth their money 
and the long-ass ticket line. Then, 
Gibbard smiles. Like a nervous college 
kid playing his first gig (complete with 
the Obama guitar sticker), he starts to 
shake. Hands fly upward to clutch the 
mic for “The New Year,” an unexpect-

edly epic version that powers Chris 
Walla’s electric guitar to full-throttle 
rock. Gibbard’s a nervous bird, and he 
almost trips over his amp in excite-
ment. He pumps the crowd, jump-
ing forward and back, fingers a blur 
from shirt to mic to hair. It’s a move 
he’ll replicate for the heaviest songs; 
the heaviest of which (“We Laugh 
Indoors,” “Crooked Teeth”) — com-
plete with thundering drums and sky-
opening riffs — stun many a fan into 
silence. Who knew Death Cab could 
rock so hard?

Compared to notoriously sleepy 
albums, it’s almost unbelievable how 
much energy reverberates on stage. 
Everywhere you look, Gibbard’s falling 
off an amp, Walla’s breaking into a solo 
and Jason McGerr — in show-stealing 
fashion — is whaling on the drums like 
they owe him money. The crisp catalog 
takes tracks from every album, mixing 
fan favorites (“Photobooth”) with clas-
sic spotlights (“I Will Follow You Into 
the Dark”). And on that last song, the 
crowd drowns Gibbard out — everyone 
knows every word, and the air vibrates 
with a singular crystallized emotion.

“I need you so much closer,” 
Gibbard trembles on the last encore. 
It’s his love song to the concertgoers, 
and they respond, reaching out across 
the space that separates them from the 
gleaming, smoking stage.

Death Cab for Cutie
■ The Open Door EP
ATLANTIC

L et’s go back in time — way back, to 1998, when Lewinsky was humping Clinton, the economy was up and a couple kids were strumming chords at a little col-
lege called Western Washington University. Back 
then, Death Cab for Cutie hailed from rainy-day 
Bellingham and its first LP, Something About 
Airplanes, was still firmly rooted in the land 
of sedated indie sparkle-flies. Fast-forward 10 
years to a platinum record, a major-label con-
tract, multiple world tours — could anyone have 
guessed they’d get so far? The quartet’s gone 
from comatose to powerhouse in a matter of 
albums; now, they’re headlining a U.S. tour with 
the scantily-clad EP The Open Door.

Guess all those love songs paid off. The five-
track list of earnest relationship fixer-uppers was 
cut straight out of the amped-up, atmosphere-
swirled Narrow Stairs. And it’s pretty obvious 
why — they’re are all doped-up and giggly, too 
fun for the muscled-up gold LP. “Little Bribes” 
is a case in point: a twangy, folky jaunt that hails 
back to basics (Fleetwood Mac status) and pits 
Ben Gibbard’s tunes against his world-weary 
ways. “You said that you were lonely/ And then 
you kissed like lonely people do” wades a bit 
too deep for a summer swim. Brownie points, 
then, to “A Diamond and a Tether” — Chris 
Walla’s space-guitars actually fit the star-crossed 
mood. “I know that you can’t hold out forever,” 
Gibbard admits (no doubt to at-home fiancée 
Zooey Deschanel), and just like that, captures 
the essence of long-distance love.

Death Cab for Cutie’s come a long way from 
Transatlanticism (still a top-five indie fave), but 

it’s this effortless spirit that will carry the band 
through all the multiplatinum records to 

come. Even if money’s got them respon-
sibilities (mainly, babies), they’re still 

young — just over 30. And if Paul 
McCartney can… Baby, age ain’t 

nothin’ but a number.

CONCERT REVIEW

"9�!,,)%�#5%2$/�sASSOCIATE HIATUS EDITOR

GUARDIAN: What has inspired you lately? What bands, books 
or artists? 

NICK HARMER: I just finished this Guns N’ Roses biogra-
phy called “Watch You Bleed” … Amazing! That band was 
crazy, and so off the rails! That was actually pretty inspiring to 
read about rock days of yore. 

G: Do you ever think Death Cab For Cutie would be that kind 
of band? 

NH: No, we are definitely not anywhere near the trajectory 
of Guns N’ Roses. Not even close. It’s just so radically differ-
ent that I can’t even imagine how people make it through the 
world sometimes. Our songwriting — and life on the road 
— is far more, far more nerdy. I think probably the guys in 
Guns N’ Roses would shake their heads in shame. “I thought 
you guys were in a rock band, what’s going on?” And we like 
sitting online and blogging, running on the treadmill and 
actually, we don’t drink, so there you have it.  

G: You’ve been with DCFC for over a decade now. How have 
your relationships with everyone changed? Or have they since 
the beginning? 

NH: Yeah, you know, in a lot of ways they haven’t changed at 
all. We’re still a group of guys from a small college town. We’re 
just trying to figure out how to make music and follow our 
dream together. I still see my friends, you know, like the day 
that we first met. There’s not a lot that has changed on some 
levels — and then, on other levels, everything has changed. 
We’re all adults now, some of us have families. It’s an interest-
ing thing to grow older and into adulthood and also juggle 
that with being in a touring rock band. That’s provided its own 
set of really exciting adventures. 

G: What’s the hardest thing about it? 

NH: The travel. Honestly, that’s the hardest thing about it 
because there are so many great things about being in a band. 
But when you’re away from home, sometimes — when you’re 
200 days away from home in a year — that kind of travel 
schedule puts a real strain on a lot of relationships that are 
outside of this. You need a real patient group of people waiting 
for you at home. That’s always the hard thing — you’re away 
for a lot of stuff. We’re getting better at [it]; we’re learning how 
to do it. 

G: You keep a blog called “Colony Collapse” in which you post 
amusing pictures, deep thoughts and guiding principles. What is 
a guiding principle or motto of your life, or of your art? 

NH: Actually, if there’s ever been a creative motto that I’ve 
ever subscribed to — like if I could get it tattooed on me or 
something like that, even though I’d never do it — the motto 
comes honestly from the Muppets movie. It’s really had this 
resonance with me, a line in one of the songs right at the end 
of the movie when they’ve all finally come to Hollywood and 
they realize their dream and they’re making their movie and 
it all comes crashing down — because it’s just so big, and 
there’s just so much love and so much happiness that they 
can’t control all of it.  

“Life’s like a movie/ Write your own ending/ Keep believ-
ing/ And keep pretending.” That little line in the song is 
exactly how I feel daily … And that’s kind of juvenile, I sup-
pose, on some levels, but that’s really hard to do when you get 
older, and you have more responsibilities and a life to juggle. 
Real world expectations with the dreams you had when you 
were a little kid. 

G: What’s something that people wouldn’t usually know about 
DCFC?  

NH: I think our albums are always kind of mellow, kind 
of quiet, real personal affairs. I think people are always 
surprised when they come see us live, when they see how 
exuberant and energetic we can all be when we’re playing. 
We enjoy rockin’ out, jumpin’ around and having a good 
time … It’s all about dancing and having a good time. Our 
show’s a celebration.

It wasn’t until Cole Porter returned to 
Broadway at the end of the Jazz Age that he 
finally found the critical praise he’d been pining 
for after WWI. And with musical scores for shows 
like “Kiss Me, Kate,” it’s no surprise the San Diego 
Symphony is playing tribute to the American 
composer with Michael Feinstein on the keys and 
Marvin Hamslisch with the baton. (EG)

Arguably the best reggae out

spirit. It didn’t take long for the rest

I n my junior (and most memorable) year of high school, I was lucky enough to find my name on a roster shoehorned with 
seniors who knew their fourth and final 
year had culminated in Mr. Ojeda’s “The 
Art of Film.” Seeing as we spent half of nine 
months sitting slack-faced in the dark with 
our eyes pinned to the pull-down screen 
and the other half chatting about what we 
had absorbed the day before, the course 
was undoubtedly popular. Of course, I had 
been about as fortunate to land a spot in the 
class as my school had been to pay for it. So, 
because many students won’t ever get the 
chance to take a film class, the following is 
a brief guide to mysterious terms that any 
serious enthusiast should know:

Art house: Any film found “intriguing” by 
feminists, the petty bourgeoisie, Europeans 
or Democrats. See: “Last Tango in Paris”

Avant-garde: A French term to describe 
films that value artistic creativity over 
coherence, revenue, sobriety and the 
director’s original intent. See: “Treatise on 
Slime and Eternity.”

Biopic: A documentary with fictional 
elements added for dramatic effect and 
actors often better looking than the real 
thing. See: “Ray,” “Erin Brockovich.”

Blaxploitation: Films utilizing 
discriminated and often unemployed actors 
and film crews. Most put black actors into

MONOTONOUS PERFORMANCE ART SLIPS INTO SNOOZE MODE 
By Hannah Kang
Staff Writer

T he play begins the moment you step into the theater. Several white-faced soldiers stand eerily still in various corners, hold-
ing props and staring at fixed points. A soldier 
in a clear glass box directs our attention to the 
mechanical actions of his daily life: He sorts his 
peas, he eats his peas, he salutes, he digs, he lifts 
weights. The black rubber glove attached to the 
box invites you to touch him, although he will 
ignore you. As you watch the actor go through 
the motions while gazing into the void of space 
in front of him, you can’t help but wonder — 
what does it all mean?  

Turns out, he doesn’t really know, either. 
The soldier in the box is Franz Woyzeck 

(Daniel Rubiano), the title character of a slate-
gray dreamscape of drudgery. He is the army 

barber, a poor man whose life consists of cycli-
cal toil so that he can earn his two cents for his 
growing family and beautiful wife Marie (Claire 
Kaplan). Woyzeck’s diet consists entirely of 
peas, so that he may earn a little extra money 
from a nameless mad-scientist-come-doctor 
(Josh Adams). 

Eventually, Woyzeck’s unbearable circum-
stance drives him to madness — madness that 
is even madder than all the mad people around 
him. Trouble is, the play stomps around too 
symbolically to tie itself down to a clear plot. It 
teeter-totters on the fine line between perfor-
mance art and stony-driven theater. Marie and 
all the other unnamed actors receive a spotlight 
parody, complete with proto-gothic carnival 
music — a desperate, cheap-gag attempt to 
hold the audience’s attention.

Woyzeck and his compatriot Andres spend 
their idle time mock-marching and needlessly 

filling buckets of water. Such silent sidetracks 
only highlight the meaninglessness of their 
lives — and meaninglessness as central, exis-
tential subject matter is just about as interesting 
as, well, peas. 

Despite these setbacks, “Woyzeck” lives 
and breathes absurdist despair that borders 
too closely on menial tasks, following the 
glass-chamber rotation of the young man star-
ing out into the theater. The entire regiment 
of gray soldiers sprint toward the audience 
at the play’s beginning, only to be halted by 
something lingering beyond, amid the harsh 
light; something that makes them turn back to 
face the concrete walls in fear. Something then 
moves them (possibly the depressing chamber 
music recycled from “Danton’s Death” — come 
on, step up) to continue fleeing the stage and 
stumbling back, over and over and over. Only 
the fool, flapping about in his untied straight-
jacket, remains oblivious to their attempt at 
aggression against the cage of routine.

The acting, of course, is remarkably fine 
— maybe even too fine. Rubiano’s beautifully 
naive portrayal of the pea-popping Woyzeck, 
in all absurd earnestness, attracts mockery 
from those who refuse to understand him. 
This Ewan McGregor impersonation takes on 
new life the further Woyzeck descends into 
insanity, until he deteriorates into a tattered 
shell of the simple, hardworking man he used 
to be. The cold authority of the doctor com-
municates an educated, scientific objectivism, 
contorted with a strange and sensual perver-
sion as cold and unfamiliar as your annual 
checkup. 

In another scene, the majority of the regi-
ment transforms into white-masked mario-
nettes, and Marie and Woyzeck wander around 
the stage, enthralled by the dolls. Woyzeck imi-
tates and prods one of the marionette soldiers, 
remarking to his wife, “Look at him go!” 

The two characters mouth the exact 
motions of the audience as we wander through 
the museum exhibit of soldiers: You are 
Woyzeck,Woyzeck is you and this is as much 
our life as it is his.

Doesn’t life suck? 

Woyzeck

Lacuna Coil
■ Shallow Life
CENTURY MEDIA

W hat do you do after guesting on a come-back album with Megadeth, one of the big four of ’80s metal? If you’re Lacuna Coil’s 
Cristina Scabbia, you write an album like a shark 
— graceful yet predatory. 

Since 2003’s Comalies, the Italian band has 
been on the rise, blending Scabbia’s classical 
contralto with guitars on max distortion for a 
burst of melodic power metal (think Linkin Park 
meets Nightwish). Sneaking up the food chain, 
Shallow Life packs six hammering, four-star 
tracks — then shoots blanks with six forget-
tables.

Crank the guitars to 11, slice Scabbia’s sand-
paper harmony with baritone Andrea Ferro and 
the hunt is on. Like the distant smell of chum 
in the water, “Survive”’s guitars aren’t playing 
distinct riffs; they circle in the background, 
creating a wall of sound. The next three tracks 
slip into pulse-pounding sameness, a heartbeat 

inside your head. “I Like It” spins Scabbia’s 
jangling vocals like a harsher version of Pink’s 
“So What,” muttering guitars chopping through 
tense verses while the chorus explodes, Scabbia 
soars, and Ferro follows in her wake.

But then the shark flounders. The radiant 
chorus of “Spellbound” unchains guitars for 
a stellar solo, but falls flat in Ferro’s sneering, 
I-think-this-is-American accent. Pretentiously 
deep lyrics and plodding piano melodies pollute 
the waters for an unclimatic, murky conclusion. 
Fortunately, a stable of radio-ready singles still 
give Shallow Life plenty of power to chip your 
teeth on. For genre virgins looking for a first 
and metalheads who just can’t get into bullish 
growling, Lacuna Coil is more stealthy with just 
as much bite.

Asher Roth
■ Asleep in the Bread Aisle
SRC/UNIVERSAL MOTOWN

M eet Asher Roth: that white kid who spent freshman year polishing off white Russians in his dorm and perfecting his 
rap-battle “skills” at frat parties. In his first 
major-label release, Asleep In the Bread Aisle, 
Eminem Jr. sets out to prove (again) that a 
cracker in the hood’s gotta have guts — even 
if that hood’s an ADT-rigged suburbia with a 
basketball hoop in every cul-de-sac and a Benz 
in every garage. Roth can still spit with the best 
of ’em, but he’s easily overlooked with flimsier-
than-thou material that’s — let’s face it — way 
less dramatic than a drive-by.

Aside from “I Love College” (unfortunate 
frat party go-to for the next five years) and “As 
I Em” (Roth’s soundalike response to Eminem 
comparisons), Roth only raps about middle-
class minutiae. “His Dream” examines his 
working-class father. “Bad Day” dwells on the 
time Roth forgot to bring his iPod on a flight 

from Atlanta to New York. Seriously? 
On “Lion’s Roar,” Roth switches from a 

fourth-note rhythm to an up-tempo, double-
time track. Problemo uno: It features the king 
of double-time, Busta Rhymes — who rips 
through the second verse and blows Roth out 
of the water.

Not that we didn’t expect it. Roth’s steady 
flow and witty one-liners — artfully mixed 
into serious tracks (“Fallin’,” “His Dream”) and 
bizzaro romps (“Lark On My Go-Kart,” “Blunt 
Cruisin’”) — get a gold star for effort. But even 
if we like Asher Roth (and kind of wish he 
was our roommate), the supersenior’s due for 
graduation. For now, take his words with that 
grain of salt on your tequila glass; after all, 
“Time isn’t wasted when you’re getting wasted.”

compensation for their low salary and 
inability to make their own films. See: 
David Denby.

Film noir: A genre and/or style that

’50s that was abandoned after directors 
gained adequate budgets. See: “Ladri di

Mockumentary: Depending on the 
severity of the filmmaker’s misanthropy, 
this tends to be either a subversive 
comedy or an overpopular television 
sitcom about white-collar management. 
See: “Borat,” “The Office.”

Romantic comedy: Generally 
heterosexual film in which audiences 
find humor in how awkward/ironic 
dating was before eHarmony, “To 
Catch a Predator” and LiveLinks. See: 

Chick flick, “You’ve Got Mail,” “Love 
Actually.”

Screenwriter: Any individual 
unaware that writing movies doesn’t 
pay the water bill. Often seen pecking

Associate Hiatus Editor

T he portrayal of director Noah Baumbach as an inse-cure teen with a prick for a father was a strong selling point in “The Squid and the Whale.” The marketers 
at Studio Media are crossing their creatively weary fingers 
you saw it — and presumably wouldn’t mind watching 
it again, thus taking a $10 chance on 
“Lymelife.” But for your own sake, they 
also hope you won’t recall the much 
more honest directing, acting and story-
line of “Whale.” 

In Derick Martini’s underwhelming 
debut, the awkward growing pains of 
high school are molded, rather stiffly, 
into a square storyline. Growing up in 
the winter months of New York suburbs during the late 
’70s, Scott Bartlett (an inbred Rory Culkin striving for the 
shy candor of a soft-spoken, 15-year-old runt) hasn’t fully 
realized the reality of his working-class household: Dad’s 
having an affair with his secretary, and Mom’s coping with 
overprotection issues and a penchant for pot.

But after his brother (real-life big bro Kieran Culkin) 
returns from a sojourn overseas, he is apparently less 
reluctant to challenge their overbearing father (the 
paunchy Alec Baldwin), and emotional conflict bubbles 

over, despite the fact that the film, as a whole, remains 
numbingly dull. 

Mirroring Baumbach’s own experiences, “Lymelife” 
tells a melodramatic story about spending adolescence 
trapped in a divided home — only with fewer complex 
characters, the same worn subplots (think “American 
Beauty”) and a tacked-on, sunny-eyed romance.

While Emma Roberts might not boast an impres-
sive resume, she’s more entertaining as 
Adrianna Bragg than Bartlett, who ends 
up wallowing in timidity for most of 
the film. Lively and brazen (and prac-
tically transplanted from a Cameron 
Crowe film, sex appeal notwithstand-
ing), she’s the only reason “Lymelife” 
barely pulls off the romp of a romantic 
comedy while palming the melodrama 

of a cathartic coming-of-age. 
If his actors had been more convincing, it would have 

been a good call on Martini’s part to rely so heavily on 
their feeble talent. But with Cynthia Nixon as the peren-
nially plastic housewife (in shrill pitch) and Alec Baldwin 
the dour dad with a knack for delivering lines as mono-
tone as Morse code, Martini’s crutch hurts his film more 
than it helps. Hard as Timothy Hutton tries in vain to 
redeem “Lymelife” of its weaknesses, the script and acting 
are too rehearsed to earn our favor.

FILM REVIEW: “ANVIL! THE STORY OF ANVIL”
3.5 out of 4 STARS (Note to Webmaster: Movies are out of four stars, not five like music reviews.) 

By Michael Tang
Contributing Writer

Every 14-year-old who gets his 
idle hands on his father’s dust-col-
lecting guitar, couched in darkness 
of some suburban closet, dreams of 
becoming a rock star. And in the real-
life saga of lead guitarist Steve “Lips” 
Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner 
— members of has-been Canadian 
heavy-metal band “Anvil” — things 
aren’t any different, at least on the 
surface. As the fairytale goes, these 
two washed-up chefs might not merit 
more than a sneering glance, but 
inside, the ’80s punk spirit lives on.  

“I need to realize this while I can,” 
roars Kudlow in tears as he confronts 
Reiner. With a receding, ashy hair-
line and bags under his puppy eyes, 
Kudlow’s dreams seem comically 
unattainable. But it’s that underdog 
sentimentalism (and earnest indie 
docu-filming) that woos the hearts 
of any sympathetic audience. Who 

knows — it might just pull its self-
titled band from the trenches of one-
hit wonder obscurity. 

Led on a whirlwind comeback 
tour through Europe by eccentric 
and long-time fan Tiziani Arrigoni, 
Anvil faces a string of obstacles that 
might’ve made any other, less moti-
vated, less “destined” band admit 
self-defeat. Count them off: disgrun-
tled Eastern European bar owners, 
missed trains, strained friendships 
and burned bridges.

Nostalgic, handheld cinema-ver-
ite style camerawork is probably a 
direct tribute to 1984 cult mockumen-
tary, “This Is Spinal Tap.” It does the 
film justice, permitting audiences to 
explore the world of backstage con-
frontations and dressing-room drama. 

It’s only when director Sacha 
Gervasi goes deeper — juxtaposing 
Kudlow and Reiner’s nine-to-five 
blue-collar environments with old 
concert footage and interviews with 
their respective families — that the 

impact blurs, with a biting sense of 
disappointment and frustration.

Ultimately, its Gervasi’s ability to 
excavate the honest, extensive and 
tumultuous relationship between 
Kudlow and Reiner that allows “Anvil” 
to transcend Laguna Beach reality-
show sentimentalism and tug our 
emotions. “I won’t let you jump off a 
cliff, I’ll stop you,” says Reiner, after 
Kudlow goes on a divisive rant. Then 
his voice falters, the tears collect and 
Kudlow approachs with open arms.

It’s at moments like these that 
Gervasi’s  keen eye for heartfelt 
breakthrough lifts “Anvil” from sim-
ple revelation to solemn reflection — 
as the audience hangs at the edge of 
their seat, hoping for a big comeback.

“Anvil” is by no means your typi-
cal VH1 recap. Instead, its unpre-
tentious artistry pays tribute to the 
music industry’s life-or-death con-
flicts — propelling the boys to the 
edge of stardom and tearing them 
down just as rapidly.

10-3 lead over Cal State Monterey Bay.
UCSD held the Otter lineup at bay 

in the second game of the series, win-
ning 4-1. Gaito won her ninth game of 
the season, giving up only three hits 
while tossing a complete game.

The first run came during the sec-
ond inning on a RBI bunt single from 
sophomore catcher Nicole Monroe. 

Later in the inning, Lesovsky gave 
UCSD a 4-0 cushion with an RBI 
single. Lesovsky finished the regular 
season with 32 RBIs, tied with Habib 
for the team lead.

The Tritons will face Cal State 
Monterey Bay one more time dur-
ing the CCAA Championship 
Tournament. The Tritons have over-
powered Cal State Monterey Bay in 

three out of five games this season.
“We are gearing up for this tourney 

and want to end our season with a win,” 
Monroe said. “I know we can do it; 
the past two games we played against 
Monterey are proof that when we have 
our A game, we are unstoppable.”

to do and we just managed to fin-
ish strong,” junior utility Stephanie 
Heinrich said.

On Saturday afternoon, the Tritons 
faced off against Cal State Monterey 
Bay, which also lost its first-round game. 
UCSD jumped to a quick lead over the 
Otters in the first quarter thanks to the 
strong play of freshman attacker Jessica 
Tran. Freshman two-meter Kirsten 
Bates and senior utility Bridgette Bugay 
also scored in the quarter, giving the 
Tritons a 4-0 lead. UCSD continued the 
offensive onslaught with Bates scoring 
a hat trick in the second quarter alone, 
while freshman utility Kelsey Schultz 
also scored, giving UCSD an 8-1 lead 
at halftime.

After watching her teammates 
stomp the Otters in the first three peri-
ods, Gstettenbauer came in to score 
two goals of her own in the second 
half as the Tritons cruised to an easy 
14-4 victory.

In the first game of the tournament, 

the Tritons faced the Seawolves, who 
they played previously this season, 
squeaking out a 7-6 win.

In the first quarter, Gstettenbauer 
and Heinrich scored one goal apiece, 
but were matched by Sonoma State 
to tie the score at two. Junior attack-
er Audra Bloom scored first in the 
second period, but after that, the 
first half belonged to the Seawolves. 
Sonoma State scored four unan-
swered goals to finish the quarter 
with a 6-3 halftime lead before the 
Tritons knew what hit them.

“Things just weren’t working for us 
this time, and they played really well,” 
Quayne said.

The Seawolves continued their 
streak by scoring the first goal of the 
third before Tran answered back with 
a goal, making it 7-4.

Entering the fourth quarter down 
by three, the Tritons were staring 
down a big obstacle in their hopes 
of making it to the NCAA tourna-
ment. Desperately needing to get their 

offense back on track and slow down 
Sonoma State’s tempo in the fourth 
quarter, the Tritons were unable to 
manage as the Seawolves scored the 
first two goals before Gstettenbauer 
could muster her second goal. At the 
end of regulation, UCSD found itself 
on the losing end of a 9-5 game against 
a team it had already beaten this sea-
son.

The Tritons took fifth in the tour-
nament, finishing their season at 
12-20. UCSD struggled with losing 
early on one of the team’s strongest 
offensive and defensive players in 
junior utility Stephanie Bocian; the 
team spent much of the season playing 
with a shuffled lineup.

“It was hard losing Stephanie to an 
injury during the season,” Heinrich 
said. “She’s a good athlete and we 
struggled trying to find a replacement, 
but we worked through it.”

more of a congratulatory event for a 
season well raced, and a no-pressure 
chance to slug it out with the big 
guns.”

Hosted by the Sacramento State 
Aquatic Center, the Triton men begin 
at 7 a.m. at Rancho Cordova.

“We have spent all year training 
for this weekend, countless practices 
on and off the water all leading up 
to this race,” senior co-captain Jon 
Lynch said. “Even with all of our 
recent success in the past few seasons, 
it has been 10 years since UCSD 
has won the varsity eight category at 
WIRA. We are not satisfied with get-
ting second. Our goal is simple: win. 
We train too hard to go for anything 
less.” 

UCSD’s toughest competitor will 
be Gonzaga University — the varsity 
eight squad’s only loss this year, com-
ing by less than one second. 

“We are going to show up with 
the attitude that we are the fastest 

crew at the championship, with the 
idea that it is a mental advantage 
when others perceive us as such,” 
Andre said. “I think we all know 
we have a good chance of winning 
the varsity category if we execute 
well despite the fact that we haven’t 
beaten Gonzaga in recent history. 
We lost to them in a tight race earlier 
this year, which we believe we can 
avenge, so I anticipate a dogfight 
all the way down the racecourse. 
We have a tough eight guys in the 
boat that I think will rise to such an 
occasion.”

The women’s team is also looking 
to prove a point on race day. Last 
season, the varsity eight boat led the 
Grand Final pack up until the final 
five meters of the race, ultimately 
finishing second, just seven-tenths 
of a second behind winner Seattle 
Pacific University.

“Last year was quite a heartbreak-
er with SPU taking the lead in the last 
10 strokes,” senior co-captain Kelly 

Hansen said. “The nice thing about it 
is that we have three of the same girls 
that were in that boat last year and 
they are out for revenge. We are so 
driven to get out there and just attack 
the race.”

The women will begin at 8 a.m. at 
Lake Natoma in Folsom. 

“WIRA is a very important 
competition for us, as it is one of 
the only chances for our team to 
prove that we are worthy of going to 
nationals,” senior co-captian Alissa 
Kispersky said. “We will go into 
this race knowing that the boats we 
are up against are all vying for one 
spot at the nationals. Only the best 
will get there. We have an extremely 
strong eight this year, and I am 
proud to say that I have a lot of faith 
in these girls. If nothing else, we are 
going to bring our determination to 
this race.”

WATER POLO — After three ardu-
ous days of play and several hours on 
the road, the women’s water polo team 
returned home empty-handed from 
the Western Water Polo Association 
championships, closing the door on a 
difficult season that saw one of its star 
players suffer a season-ending injury 
halfway through the year. The Tritons 
went into this past weekend seeded 
fourth in conference, but after a tough 
first-round loss to fifth-seeded Sonoma 
State University on Friday, UCSD 
immediately fell into the losers’ bracket 
and were held to finishing no higher 
than fifth place. The Tritons did sweep 
their final two opponents to seal the 
victory in the consolation champion-
ship tournament, but the finish was bit-
tersweet for UCSD, which had its hopes 
set on an NCAA tournament berth.

“It was disappointing,” senior 
captain Sydney Gstettenbauer said. 
“We were definitely hoping to do 
better than we did. I mean, it wasn’t 
bad, but we would have liked to fin-
ish higher.”

In the consolation championship 
game, the Tritons were pitted against 
Colorado State University, a team they 
had beaten just three weeks before by 
one goal. The Tritons sought to com-
pensate for their poor performance on 
the first day, and were looking to prove 
themselves capable of stronger oppo-
sition. In her last game as a Triton, 
Gstettenbauer played with emotion 
and determination, dedicated to fin-

ishing her UCSD career with pride. 
In the faceoff with Colorado State, 
Gstettenbauer piled on nine goals in 
the Tritons’ 14-9 drubbing, bringing 
her year total to 84 and tying a 1995 
school record.

“It was great getting the record,” 
Gstettenbauer said. “We did some real-
ly good things [in the game].”

The Rams took a 3-2 lead in the 
first, but the Tritons, with plenty of 
experience playing from behind, out-
scored the Rams 4-1 in the secondpe-
riod to take the lead. Instead of letting 
up in the second half, the Tritons buck-
led down and topped their second-
quarter performance, outscoring the 
Rams 5-1 in the third.

“We just kind of came together 
for those last games,” junior captain 
and goalkeeper Markayla Quayne said. 
“We were mad about losing early and 
we wanted to finish strong.”

Gstettenbauer turned on the after-
burners in the quarter, scoring seven 
of her nine goals in the second half, 
almost willing UCSD to victory at 
the end of the game. With the score 
at 11-5 starting the third, victory was 
all but assured for the Tritons. Both 
teams exchanged a series of goals, but 
the six-goal deficit that the Rams had 
accumulated was too great of a barrier 
to overcome. The Tritons took their 
place in the conference championships 
confident about the finish.

“We were a little emotional in the 
beginning after losing so bad the first 
day, but we knew what we needed

CREW — The waters of Northern 
California are set to welcome 
a flurry of boat races this week-
end. Competing in the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championship Regatta on May 2 and 
3, the UCSD men’s and women’s crew 
teams head out to the state’s capital 
with victories on their minds and 
the ambition to prove they belong at 
nationals. 

Off to an inspiring start, the UCSD 
men’s varsity eight has compiled a 
record-breaking season. At the San 
Diego Crew Classic, the team recap-
tured the Cal Cup, earning a spot in 
next year’s Copley Cup. The varsity 
eight has also held a top-25 rank-
ing from the U.S. Rowing Collegiate 
National Polls every week this sea-
son and has a shot at making the 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
National Championships, a feat 
accomplished by no California 
schools outside of perennial power-
houses Cal and Stanford.

“Although we’ve shown that we 
know how to win, the important 
race is this coming weekend,” senior 
co-captain Ryan Andre said. “If 
we can win the varsity category at 
WIRA I think that would be proof 
of a really special boat.  To win the 
big regattas so consistently without a 
hiccup would be a rare achievement. 
If we do well at WIRA we can then 
look into the IRA regatta. Making 
an appearance there would be a first 
for UCSD rowing. In my eyes that is

SOFTBALL — The regular season 
may be over, but the Tritons know 
there are still important games left to 
play. After splitting a four-game series 
with Cal State Monterey Bay April 24 
and 25, the Tritons clinched the No. 3 
seed for the 2009 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championship 
Tournament. The Tritons (27-22,17-
14 CCAA) will face No. 2 seed Cal 
State Monterey Bay (34-25-1, 20-12 
CCAA) again tonight at Arnaiz Field 
in Stockton, Calif., at 7 p.m.

UCSD marched into Monterey Bay 
looking to secure a berth in the cham-
pionship tournament, but failed to do 
so in the first game of the series, losing 
a tight game to the Otters 4-3.

The Tritons took an early 1-0 lead 
in the first inning of the opening 
game. Sophomore outfielder Kristyn 
Lesovsky led off the game with a dou-
ble, scoring later in the inning on an 
error. The game was tied at one after 
three innings before UCSD regained 
its one-run lead in the fourth. Senior 
first baseman Jenni Habib smacked a 
double and came around to score, tak-
ing advantage of another Otter error. 
Cal State Monterey Bay responded by 
scoring three runs in the third, putting 
the Tritons in a 4-2 hole.

UCSD grabbed one more run in the 
sixth when senior outfielder Allison 
May slapped a single and advanced to 
second base on a passed ball. May was 
finally driven home with an RBI dou-
ble by sophomore infielder Jennifer 
DeFazio. That was the last run of the 
game, but the Tritons were unable to 
plate the tying run, falling behind Cal 
State Monterey Bay 4-3.

The Otters continued to outplay 
UCSD, taking the second game of 
the doubleheader 5-0. The game was 
scoreless until the bottom of the fourth 
inning, when Cal State Monterey Bay 
scored three runs on three hits and one 
UCSD error. The Otters added two 
more runs in the bottom of the fifth, 
capping off the shutout. The Tritons, 

who tallied six hits in the contest, 
had opportunities to score but failed 
to capitalize with runners on base. 
UCSD loaded the bases in the fourth 
inning but failed to score any runs. 
Sophomore outfielder Katrin Gabriel 
and junior catcher Nicole Saari each 
had two hits in the loss while the 
Tritons stranded a total of 12 runners.

UCSD freshman pitcher Camile 
Gaito was tagged with her second loss 
of the season. Gaito pitched six innings, 
giving up eight hits and two walks.

After dropping two straight games, 
the Tritons fell from fourth place, 
heading into the last day of the regular 
season without a playoff spot. Needing 
to win its last two games to play in 
the postseason, UCSD responded to 
the pressure. Taking the final pair of 
contests against the Otters, the Tritons 

clinched the No. 3 seed in the CCAA 
Championship Tournament. UCSD 
dominated the first game 10-4 and 
took the second game 4-1.

The Triton lineup jumped on the 
Otter starting pitcher early, scoring 
five runs in the first two innings. Saari 
drove in Lesovsky with an RBI single 
to left field in the first to open up the 
scoring. UCSD continued adding to 
its lead in the second inning. Habib 
stroked a two-run double to right field, 
giving the Tritons a 5-0 advantage. 
Habib finished the game with three 
hits and five RBIs.

The Otters answered back in the 
fifth inning, scoring three runs to 
reduce the Triton lead to 5-3. UCSD 
went on to extend the lead in the sev-
enth inning. May led off with a homer 
— her first of the season. The Tritons 
added four more runs in the final 
inning, giving them a commanding
