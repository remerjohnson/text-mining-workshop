Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland, 
professor of chemistry at UC 
Irvine, published his first studies 
on the danger of chlorofluoro-
carbons more than ten years ago. 

The discoveries he and Dr. 
Mario j. Molina, senior research 
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, made were not only 
controversial , but, more 
importantly , resulted in 
substantial reductions in the 
emission of chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) from aerosol sprays. 
Since, however, hi predictions 
in the early 70 that CFCs were 
destroying the ozone layers 
which protect the earth from the 
harmful effects of ultraVIOlet hght 
from the sun, the concern for the 
problem has diminished 

"People always thll1k 'Let' wait 
and see If we get an effect," Dr 
Sherwood saId "There IS a 
tendency 111 the chemical 
profe slOn to call a finding an 
exaggeration." With the recem 
findings that the ozone has 
deple ted by a much as 50 
percent over Antarctica , Dr. 
Sherwood said that the public IS 
seeing the proof for hi 
predictions.

UC to open southern 
"sa tellite" office 

University officials announced that 
the University of California wiU open a 
southern branch of the Office of the 
President near Irvine in an effort to save 
time and resources by redUCing travel to 
and from the university's Berkeley 
headquarters. 

The leased "satellite" office will be 
used by UC President David Gardner 
and the five vice presidents to meet 
with chancellors and other officials 
concerning university business. The 
approximately 6,100 square foOl office 
will have conference facilities, a few 
individual offices and a smaU 
permanent stalT. 

The site , three miles from UC Irvine , 
was chosen due to its central location 
among the five southern UC campuses. 

The University of California currently 
operates a seven-story administrative 
building across the street from UC 
Berkeley and six leased offices in the 
city of Berkeley. 

President Gardner is reported to 
spend about half of his time in Southern 
California on university business. 

Literature department names 
annual research lecturer 

An innovative young professor in the 
department of literature at UCSD, has 
been chosen as this year's UCSD 
Academic Senate Research Lecturer for 
his study of Queen Elizabeth 1 as she is 
represented in Shakespeare and OIher 
writings of the English Renaissance. 

Louis A Montrose will deliver the 
Third Annual Academic Senate Faculty 
Lecture, "The Imagination of 
Shakespeare and the Reinvention of 
Elizabethan Culture: at 4:00 pm, June 2, 
in Garren Auditorium at the Basic 
ScIence Building, 

The prestigious nomination is made 
in recognition of a faculty member's 
outstanding and innovative research. 
The twO previous nomInees are Pulitzer 
Prize winning composer Bernard Rands, 
who received the award in 1964 for his 
musical composition "Can ti del Sole," 
followed in 1985 by Theodore 

Friedmann, a nationaUy known 
geneticist and professor of pediatriCS at 
the UCSD School of Medicine. 

Professor Montrose received his 
Bachelor of Arts degree at City College 
of New York, and Master's degree in 
English Literature from the University of 
Toronto. His association with UCSD 
began in the early 1970s while studying 
for a Ph .D. in English and American 
Literature . He Joined the literature 
department in 1974 as an assistant 
professor. 

The recipient of several graduate 
awards, Montrose's scholarship earned 
him the UCSD Dissertation FeUowship 
and a UCSD Graduate Research Grant. 
His postdoctoral grants include the 
highly regarded Marta Surtonk Weeks 
Senior Research FeUowship at Stanford 
University and a UCSD Academic 
Senate Research Grant. 

Montrose contends that within the 
field of English Renaissance studies 
there has emerged a renewed concern 
with the conditions under which 
literature is written , disseminated , 
interpreted, and institutionalized. 

"I am concerned to show," Montrose 
said, "how art and entertainment have a 
role in producing, sustaining and 
contesting relations of power in 
Elizabethan society."

UC Riverside seeks 
presidential library 

UC Riverside announced that it too is 
planning to lure the Ronald Reagan 
presidentiallibraty to its campus, 

A number of Southern California 
universities are trying to convince the 
library organizers that their campuses 
are best suited for the facility, which will 
include a library, a museum and a 
center for public affairs. 

Riverside's bid contains a clause that 
would ensure that their researchers will 
be guaranteed adequate access to the 
presidential documents.

UC to establish special K-12 
education program 

The University of California's 
continued commitment to assist the 
strengthening elementary and secondary 
education in California has led to the 
establishment of a special program, Uc. 
Senior Vice President lor Academic 
Affairs William R. Frazer told the UC 
Regents at their meeting in San 
Francisco. 

The Presidential Grants for School 
Improvement, with initial funding of 
$200,000, wiU be awarded to UC faculty 
whose research activities connibute to 
the improvement of K·12 education in 
the state, announced Frazer during a 
presentation on UC activities related to 
schools before the Regents' Committee 
on Educational Policy. 

Funding of S170,OOO wiU be awarded 
to UC faculry members during the 1987-
88 academic year under two categories: 
Project Support awards wiU be used to 
cover costs of new or ongoing 
universiry-sponsored research and 
development activities; and Research 
Recognition awards wiU go to faculty 
with completed research projects who 
translate their findings into terms useful 
to educators working in the schools. 

Another $30,000 will be made 
available for sponsoring conferences and 
seminars relating to the program. 

The Project Support grants, from 
$20,000 to S50,OOO, wiU be awarded for 
original research addressed to specific 
problems of educational practice and 
school improvement. Activities through 
which existing research wiU be applied 
to improve school practice wiU also be 
eligible for the grants, as weU as faculty 
efforts to establish partnerships between 
UC and the schools could support 
collaborative research activities on a 
long-term basis, according to Frazer. 

The Research Recognition awards, 
$5,000 each, will provide support for 
the translation of completed research 
into useful forms for K-12 teachers and

UnIversity of California students 
will be "strongly encouraged" but 
not required to participate in 
volunteer cQ mmun ity servIce

Monday night. 

The Assembly Subcomminee on

approve Assembly Bill 1820 after 
its author, Assemblymember john 
Vasconcellos, D-Santa Clara, 

am~nded the measure to make 
volunteer service for 5tate-
subsidized uniyer~ity students 
"strongly encouraged" but not

Th~ bin, which would create the 
California Human Corp, is a "caU ·

well-rounded," he said, 

Under the bill, students \.vould 
be encouraged to spend at lest 30

governmental or community· 
based organizations. 

Although the concept of 
.community service was strongly 
supported by academic and

mandatory service aspects of the 
bill were lambasted. "We've been 
accused of being the Yuppie

Sister Kathleen Kelly, a dean at 
Mount SI. Mary's College in Los 
Angeles, said that she supported 
college community service projects 
because they help keep students in 
college, "I believe community 
service helps retention efforts ," she 
said. "Students see they can 
contribute but need more 
education to do thIS." 

In addition , said Cal State San

Cochran, community servIce offers

.Andy Howard's inabilIty to hear 
any of Maura Visser's thoughtful 
criticism reveals the insecurity and 
commensurate repression within 
his organization. Without even 
addressing her concerns, he 
anacks her personally, revealing a 
level of anger and arrogance 

.unworthy of abie thinkers. As an 
example, he assumes Maura Visser 
would like him to " ... take [her r 
seriously as a comrade ," a 
'privilege' he subsequently denies 
her. Given the vindictiveness of 
his response , I highly doubt she 
craves his company or that of " ... 
anyone else like Ihim l out there ." 
Furthermore, it is strange to me 
that he would criticize her for not 
speaking up before. As a feminist 
who worked on Alrernarille Visions 
for two quarters, only to see it fold 
for lack of support, the last thing I 
would do IS verbally abuse a 
feminist for speaking out now. For 
one thing, I am happler knowing 
they have found their voice; for 
another, I conSIder myself, like Mr. 
Howard , iii-eqUIpped to Judge the 
nmeliness of any ideological 
expressIOn. 

Ahuva ovak's response is far 
more balanced, dIsplaying her 
ability to conSIder an argument 
before anempting rebuttal. Still, I 
disagree with Novak's statement 
regarding VIsser's Jaundiced 
appraisal of the graffiu recently 
removed from TLH . Novak 
correctly assertS that Visser " ... 
presupposes that this indiVIdual 
act of self-expressIOn was 
sanctIoned by the FBI/Crabtree 
organtzers." Yet , Novak maintains 
that this premIse IS faulty as the 
organtzers so-named can not 
restrict "dIrect acnon" of group 
members. as to do such would be to 
engag~ in "tOtalitarian" measures 
alien to their Ideology. To this I 
offer emphatic dissent. Do we not 
condemn right-to-life groups 
when one of their individual 

in packing 
and shipping 
small loads. 

members bombs an abortion 
clinic, and rightly so? All 
organizations can and must 
channel the actions carried out in 
their name; such is the substance 
of their existence. It does not 
matter whether this organization 
actually condoned the graffiti , 
what's important is whether or nOl 
it appears to bc their work. If so, and 
if the bulk of the student body 
abhorred that pamcular piece of 
graffiti (whether for its message or 
utter lack of aesthetic Integrity), 
then the graffitI subtracted from 
the group's efforts to expand its 
base of student support. Such was 
Visser's contention , and I am 
compelled to agree. 

The group has a choice . They 
can publicly deny or support the 
graffiti , or they can attempt to 
ignore the act and be associated 
with it by default. one of these 
options entails totalitarianism; 
what they reqUire is ethical 
dlscreuon .

More than just 
a student issue 
Editor. 

I am wriu ng to voice my concern 
about the proposed new parking 
poltcy which would require 
permits for parking on campus till 
10:00 pm at night. This new policy 
would create several problems. 

First of aU, many non-students, 
that is, members of the LaJol1a and 
larger San Diego community use 
the UCSD parking lots at night to 
attend theater, dance and music 
performances on campus and 
would be forced to find alternative 
parking spaces or pay parking fees 
to come to cultural events. The 
proposed parking policy, 
therefore, would frustrate, if not 
discourage members of the 
community, to participate In 
cultural events on campus. I believe 
that UCSD is interested in 
remaining an active cultural 
community. The new parking 
policy, however, would defeat that 
goal. 

Second, and more importantly, 
the new parking policy poses a 
threat to the safety of a large 
number ofUCSD students, namely

all those who presently do not have

chosen to commute by bike, bus, or 
foot during the day time and help 
keep the campus from 
overcrowding with even more 
vehicles. At night, however, these 
students most often drive to 
campus for safety reasons. Bicycles 
and pedestrians are difficult to see 
at night and therefore at high risk 
of getting struck by a vehicle; buses 
come infrequently and passengers 
waiting at stops are at risk of being 
raped. If. by extending the hours 
for required parking permits, these 
students are forced to purchase

permits , there remain s no 
incentive for them to use 
alternative modes of transporta-
tion. They, toO, will crowd the 
already scarce parking lots at UCSD 
during the day time. And those 
who cannot afford to buy pennits 
will, at night, be exposed to the 
danger of walking across a dark 
campus and waiting at deserted 
bus stops. 

As you no doubt know, there has 
been a great increase in night 
classes due to the lack of available 
classrooms. Already more students 
are exposed to the danger of 
walking to their vehicles at night. 

(You might remember the recently 
reported rape of a UCSD student 
on a parking lot at 10:00 pm - a 
typical time for night classes to 
end). The proposed extension of 
parking hours would only amplify 
this safety risk. 

As chancellor of this university, 
Mr. Atkinson. I am sure you are 
concerned with the safety of the 
students on campus. The 
proposed new parking policy, 
however. threatens the safety of 
many students. Therefore, I urge 
you to block this policy.

Arbitral)' decoration 
Editor: 

Recently there has been much 
attention paid to the so-called 
"wall-writers" on campus. Two 
weeks ago one was arrested for 
vandaltsm after a teacher observed 
one such "self-expressive action" 
and was quick to call the police. 
This group ha s claimed 
persecution by officials, and wants 
Qnly to be able to express 
themselves in the non-harmful 
form of writing on the walls of our 
school's stairwells. Should they be 
allowed to arbitrarily "decorate" 
our school? No. 

A select number of these 
privately public artists may indeed 
be contributing to the 
bea\lIification of the campus, but 
the manner In which they are 
gOIng about il IS wrong. They 
should realize the reasonable 
actions that should be taken to 
remedy this rift. 

The logical thing to do In a 
situation like this is to work with

against them. Don't these wall-
writers realize that whIle the true 
artists may be beneticia lly 
expressing themselves through art, 
a number of tag-alongs might just 
end up covering the walls with 
plain, worthless graffitI? How is lhe 
adminIStration to distinguish 
between the sincere wall-writers 
and the average menacing 
property defacer? 

The wall-writers . should 
organize th,emselves into some sort 
of group and petition the 
administration for the rights lO 
decorate our depressing cement 
stairwells. This way the artists 
could work unfettered by 
interruption from campus officials. 
as well as allowing officials to crack 
down on any uncenified graffiti. 

Instead of operating like a 
bunch of righteous art vigilantes. 
let's see these wall-writers organ ize 
and work with the administration 
to achieve the badly needed 
decoration that some of the 
cement buildings on campus need. 
Both sides can work together 
hassle-free, and the student body 
would appreciate the extra visual 
stimulation.

CUSI also was just beginning to

off the ground. Included in the $3 
million-plus fleet of CUSI IS the 
41-foot Nelson/ Marek Racing 
Sloop Reliance. Last owned and 
raced by Dennis Conner before 
his recent America's Cup 
activities, Reliance is, according to 
Raidt, "One of the fastest boa tS on 
the west coast." Racing crcws had

. "Who knows what will happen 
between now and the end of June 
(when Deukmejian is expected to 
sign a fi nal budget)?" 

UC President David Gardner is 
"encouraged" that the state 's 
improved revenue outlook allowed 
for the additional funding, said UC 
spokesperson Rick Malaspina . Of 
the $40 million the governor 
proposes to give to UC, $1 1.1 
million will go to mid-year faculty 
pay raises. When coupled with the 
$12.3 million Deukmejia~ had 

preVIOusly allocated (0 faculty pay 
raises. the money would allow the 
university to increase salaries by 
5.7 percent. 

The total of $23.4 million 
represents the 2.1 percent increase 
recommended by the California 
Postsecondary Education 
Commission in its survey of eight 
comparison institutions plus the 
3.6 percent differential UC sought 
to maintain a ·competitive edge· in 
faculty recruiting. 

Although university officials 
wanted to stan the pay raise at the 
stan of the fiscal year inJuly 1987, 
state officials only provided 
sufficient funds to increase salaries 
effective January 1988. 

The proposal to increase faculty 

sa laries drew praIse from UC 
Student Association Associate 
Director Kirk Knutsen , who saId 
the association "s trongly 
supponed" effons to attract the 
best possible faculty. In addition, 
he said, UCSA suppons the 
increase because university grants 
a similar pay increase to teaching 
assistants. "It is a good way to help 
TAs." 

The governor's budget also 
includes $9 million to grant staff 
members a 3 percent pay increase 
inJuly 1987, instead of the original 
proposal which was to be enacted 
in January 1988. Deukrnejian also 
proposes to bolster the $5.4 million 
allocated for staff members health 
and dental benefits by $1 .1 million .

Sta te officials have said the 
additional tax intake is a result of 
people taking advantage of capital 
gains before they are made much 
less lucrative by the federal tax 
reform. 

Because the $2.7 billion puts the 
Slate over the spending limit 
imposed by Proposition 4 (the so-
called Gann limit, named after tax 
crusader Paul Gann), Deukmejian 
wants to refund $700 million to 
taxpayers. 

The governor would like to see 
the refund come in the form of a

the room She wore a brown dress 
and her Wimple made it impossible 
to teU if she was bald. 

She introd uced herself as Sister 
Yvonne, 

And she had a story to tell. 
Her order, the Carmelites. began 

as a group of Catholic brothers 
who lived on Mount Carmel in 
Palestine during the 12th century. 
They fed and cart:d for the poor 
until th e brothers were deported 

Saint Theresa found that decadence was 
rampant in the "ranks" and was called upon 
by God to renew the order, 

Bryan BilyeulGuwdw" 

By SEAN KENEfiCK. Copy EdilOr 

I decided to visit the Carmelite Monastery on Hawley Street because I had never been to 
one before . I figured I would tell 
them who I was, maybe even Imply 
that I was going [0 Join up (they're 
always looking for recruits. right?). 
then SIt down for herbal tea WIth a 
bald man wearing a potato sack-
like cossack while he told me about 
all the secret adventures that went 
on behind the closed doors of the 
front gate . 

When I arri ved . the garden in 
from of the monastery was 
blooming in all of its spring colors. 
I wasn't surprised when I saw a 
statue of a monk right smack-dab 
in the middle of it all. He was 
bald ". weari ng a potatO sack ". 

swear I saw a Brother cautiously 
watching. 

The front door had a sign on It 
inviting me to come in, I was a linle 
disappointed when I saw that a 
friar wasn't sitting there looking a 
bit like Radar O'Reilly: actually, 
there wasn't anybody there - just 
a hallway. a wooden chair and a 
doorbell . 

I waited for a few minutes. then 
rang the bell and heard the sound 
of approachi ng footsteps. ext to 
where I was standing was a giant 
spool which connected to another 
room. The spool turned towards 
me. revealing that its center was a 
cylindrical hollow. I figured that it 
must swi ng around again. the 
window then facing the friar -
much like a dumb waiter. This 
obviously allows the brothers to be 
able to communicate and transfer 
items with outsiders while 
maintaining privacy. 

"May I help you?" 
I stood for a moment, frozen by 

the female vOIce. Wa s thiS place 
coed? 

The woman repeated her 
question a little louder. probably 
wondering whether I could hear 
her through the spool. After 
regaining my dignity by appea ri ng 
disapproving, I stated firmly who 1 
was and the purpose for my visit. 
She asked me to hold on. then 
twIsted the pool until it opened to 
me again. In the little middle. lyi ng 
on shelf paper. was a single 
skeleton key. She asked me to go ro 
room number two. 

Inside the room, I waited. It 
reminded me of a convict -civilian 
visiting room. One side was 
modestly furnished with pictures 
and other decorations (such as 
crucifixes) . On the other side of 
the bars (yes. bars ). even more 
humbly was noth ing but a green 
floor. 

After a few minutes of silently 
waiti ng, the door opened and a 
woman about 45-years old entered

("or killed ." SIster Yvonne added) 
In the 13th Cl!ntury. Beca use the 
basic thrust of their lives was to live 
as hermits. they decided to return 
to Europe and live in secluded 
areas. After they settled, their 
Brotherhood flourished. Not only 
with more brothers. however; 
sislers Joined as well In the 15th 
century, 

Saint Theresa of Avila joined the 
order in the early 16th century. She 
fo und that decadence was 
rampant in the "ranks." and was 
called upon ("by the Pope?" I 
foolishly asked) by God to renew 
the order back to, its older 
principles where hermitage and 
prayer would remain the prime 
directives. The " ew" Carmelites 
now have about 60 monasteries in 
the United tates. The San DIego 
extension was srarted by four 
sisters from Santa Clara in 1932.

that Sister Yvonne was constantly

and even cracked jokes every so 
often. She seemed like the friendly 

. "cookie -lady-down-th e-street ." -
and she laughed when I asked 
whether there were any brothers 
on the premises. She stressed that 
the monastery was not coed and 
that 18 sIsters occupicd this 
parti ular home. 

The monastery is funded both 
by outSide benefactOrs , who come 
to ask the SIsters to pray for them , 
and the work the sisters do ("Wc're

different from other nuns . While

concentrate on prayer." 

An a verage day for [he sisters 
begins with a 6:45 am Divine 
Office . a time for reading of psalms 
and prayer I had expec(ed a 4:00 
am wake-up call , but Sister Yvonne 
Slated that the group rnaywake up 
at any time they like. just as long as 
they are at the service on time (l 
suddenly got this vision of a Sister 
running down the hallways. her 
habit flying. just knowing Mother 
Cnsta . the prioress, was going to 
ye ll ), The OlTtce was followed by a 
7:30 am mass and breakfast. and a 
hour of mental prayer. Three hours 
of work time (sewing, cleaning. 
yard work) are then conducted, 
leading to anOther hour of the 
Divine Office belorc lunch. After 
lunch comes the first recreation 
hour, wh~re the sisters can chal or 

Only one out of

cants decides that 
this is the life for her, 
read the San Diego Union until it 
comes time for spiritual reading 
ending at 3:30 pm. Then , more 
work and another hour of the 
Divine Office . Supper and 
recreation follow. The last hour of 
the Divine Office and free time are 
direc tly before the 11:00 pm bed 
time. 

Sound rigorous? Sister Yvonne 
sta ted that this is one of the 
reasons why the Sisterhood is not 
for everybody. She stressed that the 
monastery is not a place to "get 
away from it all" or for anybody 
who has not made a completely 
life-giving commitment to God. 
Before maki ng any final vow, the 
sisters must have a six year 
appre nticeship of studying and 
liVing the life of celibacy and 
poverty. Only one out of e\'cry 
three applicants decides that thi 
is the life for her. 

After the final question ("No 
funny business then? ") was 
answered witll a firm "No," I shook 
Sister Yvonne's hand through the 
bars and departed from whence I 
came, le,wlng the skeleton key to

ftmshed With a 14-stroke surplus, 
and first place. The four-day totals 
for the two teams were, CSUS: 308, 
298. 291, 303, for a [Otal of 1,200 
and UCSD: 302. 304. 300,308, fo r 
a total of 1.214. Methodist College 
fmished third With a total score of 
1.221 . 

The members of the Triton team 
that made the Nationals are Pat 
Wei han , Dean Catalano, Joost 
Steenkamer, Brad Shupe and Brad 
Sterhng. ScoTlng IS determined by 
the sum of a team 's four best scores 
(out of five ) for each day. 

While UCSD was flllishing 
second III the team competition, 
their best golfer, Pat Weishan was 
takmg the IIldividual title. His 
scores of 73, 69, 73 and 74 gave 
him a sum of 289 and the posi tion 
as the best DiVision 1Il golfer in the 
country. Rochester's Greg Perry 
took second place with an overall 
score of 293. 

The past rwo years , Weishan 
had filllshed second in the nation. 
and , as a freshman , he was 
eleventh . He became the only 
golfer in Division Jl) histOry to be

years. And , by winning the 
mdlVldual championship, he has 
quahfied to compete in the 
Division [ tournament next month. 

According to Wydra, it is nearly 
impossible to challenge the 
Stanislaus reign ove r DiviSion III 
golf for two reasons: they cheat and 
their academic si tuation i much 
different. The cheating comes in 
the form of payments to the 
players. Beca use they are a 
Division III school, Stanislaus is 
not allowed to offer sc holarships. 
But they avoid this by giving 
special grants to the golfers which 
amount to baSically the same thing 
as scholarships. Wydra believes 
that there isn 't one member of the 
Stanislaus team who is p2.ying his 
way through college. 

Academically, the standards are 
much higher at UCSD. This limits 
the choice of quality golfers and 
presents a problem for Other 
intercollegiate spons at UCSD as 
well . Wydra feels , then, that 
Stanislaus has such a tremendous 
adva ntage that it is an 
accomplishment Just to come 
close . 

,·It Just gives them a whole other 
class of talent," he said. "It would be 
a herculean task to even challenge 
them, and the fact that we came 
within 14 strokes IS a monumental 
achievement." 

And even though It seems 
hopeless, Wydra still has thoughts 
of someday having the nation's 
best team. For one, he feels that 
this was the best recruiting year 
ever at UCSD. Also , several 
excellent golfers from this yea r's 
team are returning. although 
Wei shan will be graduating. 

Coming back are Steenkamer, 
Sterling, Catalano and Shupe. 
Shupe was probably this year's 
biggest surprise, not having even 
been on the golf team previously. "[ 
found him in golf class ," Wydra 
said . "('ve been tremendously 
pleased with his progress.' 

So someday, Wydra believes, 
UCSD will take the title away from 
Stanislaus. "We're certainly not 
giving up . They're staying pretty 
much the same every year and 
we're getting bener. 1 think at some 
point we'll be able to catch 
them: ~

ATTENTION! 
Bloom County Cancelled 
By MARK SANDERSON. News Editor 

FOR those of )'ou who beheve Bloom County is the backbone of The UCSD Guardian, and the columns of copy surrounding the comic are simply border tape , you have much to gain in reading this humorous, e),e-opening, yet 
sometimes disturbing history of UCSD's primary publication . And for those of you 
who read the paper so diligendy that you catch the once-in-a-lifetime typos we 
produce , you'll find this retrospection briUiant supplemental reading, 

On May 26, 1967, half of us were eating Gerber's-bab)' food and attempting to 
force the square peg into the round hole in our playpens, while the remainderofus 
were . as they say, a gleam in our parents' e)'es, man)'of our pro fessors had long hair 
and attended Berkele)" Ronald Reagan rai ed heU. in the state capital , and the 
young men in Vietnam were no longer simply "advisors: Meanwhile . Renney Senn 
introduced the first edition of the Triton TImes as "a bimonthl)' pubhcanon ... 
conceived with the idea thata new picrure of the university student is long overdue." 

Twenty years, five title changes and countless st),le and content alterations 
later, n e UCSD Guardian is an autonomous student paper, entirel), funded through 
advertiSing revenues. The only -connection it has with the university is in the 
students who produce the paper, and in th e use of a relatively small on-campus 
olTice where articles are written, edited . typeset and layed down before being sent 
to the primer. Eleven thousand copies are printed twice each week. 

In terms of qualit)" the paper has been criticized for lacking depth and 
relevance; and at times , the tarrS familiamy with the English language has even 
been questioned . But the number of individuals who focus on sentence structure as 
the fundamental weakness of The UCSD Guardian and its ancestors, pale in 
comparison to those who show concern with the role of the newspaper. 

Criticism docs nor always onginate from ,outside the paper. In 1968, during the 
second year of publication for the Triton Times, a column appearing around a 
concert promotion for The Cream and Deep Purple reflected extreme internal 
dissatisfaction with the role of the student paper and tudents as a whole. The 
author wrote, "The olTicial school newspaper . .. is supposed to reflect the atti tudes 
and thoughts of the students in the school. The Triton Times did this last year. The 
attitude was apathy on aD levels. The students of this school were , and still are for 
the most part, little more than computerized vegetables. The paper was written to 
suit them ." 

Not much has changed in the years since this column was penned. Charges of 
apathy hang on the shoulders of students, just as complaints of ineffectiveness 
continue to be levied against the AS. . 

In the June 14, 1968 edltion of the Triton Times , oppoSite a picture of then 
Chancellor John Galbraith and Muir ProvostJohn Stewan, the following lines were 
written about UCSD's student governmenl "The Associated Students is now four 
years old. Elections are still held , senate meetings.still persist, and the treasury is 
stronger, but the fruits of these student efforts are not aD that obvious. The AS. has not 
blossomed into the effective working force envisioned by its early founders ." 

1971's AS. was not only criticized, but overthrown. "The AS. Council was 
toppled by a military coup ... (on April 1) b y Generalissimo Jim Sills, who led a 
junta to instaU Karl Keating as puppet dictator of the Associated Students. ReveUe 
Provost Paul Saltman was informed the regime had plced him on a list of 'persons of 
suspicious character.' Saltman replied by asking them to 'cut the crap.'" 

Students have long sought to maintain a certain degree of control ever the 
activities of the administration . But attaining this goal has often been discouraging 
if not impossible. In 1968, history professor Roger DeLaix stated , "the students in 
the universit)' are active participants in academic affairs, but not in administrative 
affairs. The main reason ... is that they represe nt a body that exists in theory only." 

In 1978, under the direction of Reed Alpert, the Triton Times became The 
Guardian . The philosophy of the paper was "to provide a source of information 
about many facets of the university , and to provide a forum for free expression." 
Exacdya year later, an ambitious editor by the name of Eric Ja)'e , embarked on the 
task of making The Guardian a daily publi cation. This venture lasted about a year, 
until The Guardian slid into its present twice-weekly format. The present masthead 
"The UCSD Guardian" arrived on September 15, 1981. 

In pouring over the history of The UCSD Guardian it is easy to see thatasmuchas 
things change, things remain the same. Here are some of the more quotable quotes 
and notable news notes...· . 

1968 ... "AS. President Tom Shepard, T he world cannot afford another 
generation of naive coUege students; society cannot continue to exist if we create 
another era of Reagans.'" . 

1971 ... "Brian Ritter and Mark Siegel are running for AS. President and Vice 
President on a platfollll of free sex. 'Sex lS the most important thing outide of 
straight survival: Rigger said , ' and that's why people are unhappy here. Why? 
Because they don 't get laid ."' 

1972 ... "In the 'All I want for Cl-)irstmas column: John Stewart asked: 'Please 
send me Yosemite National Park in a little box,so I can reconstruct it in Muir Plaza. 
El Capltan is so much nicer than building 20 . However, if you can't bring me 
Yosemite . then could )'ou maybe build me a ki slope off the s ide of 201''' 

1974 ... "The new Student Center, plagued with numerous delays, bureaucratic 
bungling and disorganized planning has postponed its opening b)' at least two 
months." 

1978 . . . "The Ce ntrallnteUigence Agency has had a long history of contacts with 
U,c., according to agency documents released under the Freedom oflnformation 
Act. The documents , which consist of 800 pages covering activites from the late 
19505 to 1977. revealed a wide range of activities between UC statewide 
admlnistratlon , several UC campuses and the C. IA. " 

1980 , . . 'Those crossi ng the Muir parktng lot near MandeVlUe Center may have 
noticed a large white van , which has not moved from its s pot in over a ),ear and yet 
has remai ned unticketed . Campu police did n't even know It was there," 

And so, The UCSD Guardian embarks on its third decade of campus a nd 
community coverage. As alwa)'s this paper will reflect the needs, lifestylcs and 
opinions of the UCSD community. And as always those who plow through the 
enollllous amount of work necessary (0 pubhsh thIS paper WIll do 0 with 
incredible commi tment Therefo re . if you stlll need more ba kground o n the 
Guardlan, come b)1 around 9,0{) pm on any Sunda)' or W ednesday night , and ask 
o ne of us to show )'ou the ropes. ~

Deja Vu: Parallels with the past 
December 1967 
Marines Invade ReYeile 

Last week marines from a local 
base came to the ReveUe Plaza to 
confront students over the 
question of the fl)'i ng of the 
North Vlemamese flag. 

The marines had read about 
the InCident in the paper and 
had come with the intention of 
removing the flag. They found 
that the nag was no longer flyi ng 
and had, in faCl, not been for 
several da)'s. 

A heated discuss ion followed 
in which the marines asked 
several students why they had 
allowed or encouraged such an 
ac t. The toplC of the 
conversa tion then turned to the 
Vietnam war itself. with the 
marine opposing the war 
protestors. 

At thiS point Deans Murphy 
and Hull interposed. The)' asked 
the mannes to leave and their 
request was soon complied Wlth . 
Dt:an Murphy later said that he 
felt "thm purpose was dIsruptive 

and potentiaU), Violent ." He 
explained his pOSition to them, 
saying that "the purpose of the 
Plaza lS to allow free speech in 
accordance with the American 
constituti on." He said that the 
students were in no way 
violating any law by fl ying the 
North Vietnamese flag. 
AprIl 1968 
SIudentI malCh agalnlt racism 

Several hundred s tudents and 
o ther members of the academic 
community marched through the 
streets of La Jolla in what was 
termed "the beginning of a 
crusade to end white racism In 
America," 

After the morning 
commemoration service for 
Martin Luther King, the slain 
civll rights leader, students were 
urged to jom In an effort to 
persuade Americans of the 
urgency for a dramanc change In

walked three abreast in a Ime 
that stretched for more than twO 
blocks. Several camed placards,

to La Jollans. One hand-oul sheet 
read: "The King is dead ... killed

Reaction to the march was 
varied . One lady handed out

When offered literature one lad y

UCSD'I tr-.:oIlegkrt8 atIIeIIc:a 

A co ntroversy seems to be 
brewing over the role that 
athletics, especially Intercollegiate 
ath letiCS, is to play in UCSD's 
future . 

Chancellor McGill revealed 

yesterday to the Triton that a 
committee he had a ppointed to 
explore this area had produced 
con fli cting and inconclusive 
results . ow the Chancellor 
hopes to appeal to the student 
body for advice, for he feels that 
they should have the 
preponderant vOice in this 
malter. 

McGtll sald that the athletic 
department has been pushmg for 
qUite some time to join. the 
California College Athletic 
Assocla tion, which would involve 
intercoUegiare competi tion in an 
establtshed league o f colleges. To 
implement thiS , they also desired 
to embark upon a program of 
athletic subsidization. 

McGiU felt that they were 
pushing toO fast, but that by the 
same token, a previously 
formulated policy of the 
AcademiC Senate, initiated largel)' 
through the efforts of o ne 
person , was unreasonable; thiS

Referendum 

........ Included in the election were

poll. Propo ition A a ked that 
speCIal financial assistance , 
drawn from private ources, be 
given to athlete . tudent 
defeated the propo al 1630 to 
572. The propo ition was an 
outgrowth of demand made by 
the athletes aimed at boo ting 
the level of excellence di played 
by our athletic teams. After the 

defeat of the propo mon, it wa 
announced that inter-collegIate 
football will be ancelled 
i ndefi mtely. 

Propo ition B asked whether 
tudent should as e 

themselve a fee to build one or 
more tudent centers on campu . 
ludent approved the measure 

by the nece sary two-third 
margin , 77 percent to 23 
percent, with over 60 per ent of 
the tudent vonng. 

The opinton poll concerned 
recruitment and was dIvIded into 
four ections. The first one asked 
whether rudy fee monies should 
be used to support the Placement 
Office, and students voted 70 
percent yes and 30 percent no.

June 1969 
Verdict In trial 

Waiting for Chancellor MLGill 
In hi offi e was the gho t of 
February 21. On that day a 
group of students blocked the 
entrance to the Placement Office 
to prevent a marine recruiter 
from conducting interviews. 

Eight student were identified 
by Dean of Students George 
Murphy and their names were 
turned over to the Student-
Faculty Committee on tudent 
Conduct. Its hearing into the 
incident started in mid April and 
continued for everal weeks. 

The students eventually 
admitted that they had been 

present on the steps and then 
launched into a defen e of their 
action . They contended that 
recruitment for the arnled for es 
wa incompatible with the 
univer ity's function as an 
educational institution , and thus 
they should not be found guilty 
of violating any rules. 

The committee found 
different. Although idestepping 
the issue of whether military 
recruitment IS a proper part of 
the university, the committee did 
recommend that the Chancellor 
put the students on probation for 
a year. The Chancellor agreed 
with the committee and the case, 
though not the issue, appears 
settled.
