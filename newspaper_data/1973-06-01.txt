Humanities Library 
Burglarized 

H.nC._ 
Last Sunday, over the Memorial Day weekend, both 

the Humanities and Literature departments,which are 
located in the Humanities Library at Revelle, were 
burglarized. 

The burglaries were reported separately on Monday. 
At that time the campus police secured the office doors 
and boarded up the windows the burglars had smashed 
in to gain entrance. 

According to Lee Nichols, Administrative Assistant in 
the Humanities Department, about S2,500 worth of 
books and office equipment was stolen between the 
two departments. 

The Humanities department lost two IBM typwriters, 
a ditto machine and ditto paper, over a dozen 7' tapes 
of Renaissance music and plays which were purchased 
specifically for Humanities, office supplies such as 
staplers, and numerous books, the number not yet 
known. Among the books stolen were two valuable 
Jensen art history books. Lee Nichols' personal loss 
consisted of a dictionary, a thesaurus and an atlas. 

Merril Kirkman, a Humanities secretary had several 
personal items stolen including a tennis racket and 
some cassettes. 

In the Literature Department, Sandy Clay, the Ad-
ministrative Assistant to the Literature Department, said 
that no books were taken but three IBM typewriters, a 
calculator and a radio were stolen along with some 
miscellaneous office supplies. 

In the Humanities Department both Ms. Kirkman's 
and Ms. Nichols' desks were rifled through. However, 
this was not the case in the offices robbed in the Lit 
department. In both cases only the Administrative 
offices were broken into. 

Both Ms. Clay and Ms. Nichols agree that the 
burglars were "selective shoppers" and had had "time 
enough to pick and choose.' Ms. Nichols feels that the 
burglary occurred around 2-3 a.m. Monday. 

Jean Miller, a campus policeman, took fingerprints at 
both sites of entry and he has notified all fII1'er local 
law enforcement agencies that the burglary ~ place. 
He also requested a complete inventory Of stolen 
items. 

According to Miller, the police have no idea how 
many burglars there were or if it was an inside job. 
However, Ms. Nichols feels that a "student guide must 
have assisted in the theft." 

It appears that the big wooden doors at both sides of 
the building were open and these doors gave the 
burglars easy entrance to the building. It seemed that 
these doors are "not secure as often as insecure," 
according to Ms. Clay. 

Miller says it is up to the departments to change 
precautions at their offices and that the police can only 
mak "recommendations regarding security changes." 

McElroy Addresses UCSD Women

a ss '68 Reunion 
Tom Robinson, of the' Planning Office and an Alum-

nus of the class of '68, is organizing a reunion of the 
class of '68 c,n June 23. 

The class of '68, made up of about 120 students, was 
the first class to compete the four year undergraduate 
curriculum at Revelle. 

At that time the class gave three large granite rocks to 
the school which lay near the site of the new gym. At 
their celebration beer bust at Matthews Campus they 
decided that in five years hence they would have a 
formal reunion . 

According to Robinson , the biggest problem he is 
having is contacting the alumni because the university 
does not have current addresses on most of the class. 
However, so far fifty members have neen contacted. 

The reunion will consist of a beach party at 4:30 p.m. 
at Scripps beach. There will also be some faculty and 
staff members in attendance as well. 

Anyone wishing further information or that has 
knowledge of Addresses of alumni of the '68 class 
should contact Tom Robinson at the Alumni and 
Development Office at 212 Matthews Campus or by 
calling ext. 2986 as soon as possible. 

Muir Orientation 
NeedS Planners 

There will be a meeting of all Muir students in-
terested in planning a fall orientation for incoming 
students (freshmen and transfer students) on Monday, 
June 4 at 3 p .m . in the Muir Apartment TV lounge. 

It is hoped that many upperclassmen will take part in 
the planning. Even though students may not be here 
during the summer, contact will be maintained either 
by ma il or phone. Ideas, advice and help is needed in 
planning an orientation in the fall that responds to the 
new students' needs. Those who cannot attend the 
meeting but have ideas to share should either call or 
drop by the Muir Dean ' s Office . 

FrHhmah Dana M . Rowley will heave a watermelon 
off Urey Hall toclily at 1 :00, thanks to a Physics problem 
five years ago.

200/0 Turn Out 
In Revelle Election 

Mike Greene, Revelle Election Commisioner, an-
nounced the results of the Revelle Committee on 
College Affairs Election, which was held last week . 

Six candidates, Jeff Baker, Chris Hammel, Rick Drom, 
Ester Garnica, Hannah Cohen and Paula Smith were 
chosen to serve on the committee next year. 

Greene said that 436 Revelle students turned out to· 
vote for the 14 candidates who ran; about 20% of those 
registered at Revelle. 

Greene urged that in the future more time be 
allowed between nomination of candidates and the 
actual election. He also suggested that four days of 
voting be scheduled instead of three. 

In addition' Greene asked the R.C.C.A. to consider 
alloting some money to each candidate so that each 
would be able to campaign for himself. 

Job Trends Cited 
Trends in Federal Hiring indicate that the prospects 

for June graduates interested in government employ-
ment will range from generally excellent in 
engineering and health fields to poor In nonspecialty 
biological sciences, and competitive in physical 
sciences and mathematics. 

In fields not requiring ' specialized education, the 
Federal Service Entrance Exam must be taken. As in the 
past, for those with high FSEE scores, the best oppor-
tunities this year should be in such areas as social 
security, logistics occupations, inspection and in-
vestigation, and a variety of administrative fields . Here 
too, the market is highly competitive. In San Diego this 
exam may be taken on the second Thursdayandfourth 
Saturday of each month except August September, 
and December. 

There is hope that Federal agencies will be doing 
more hiring as they move into their fiscal year 1974 
budgets, allowing for more opportunities to open up 
during July through September. So, if you are or will be 
a recent graduate who has applied for civil service 
employment, and find that you are still on the job 
market this summer, be sure to check your eligibility 
notices re-expiration dates and take necessary steps to 
inform the Civil Service Commission to keep your file 
current. 

You may obtain pamphlets, announcements, 
application forms and other information concerning 
Federal employment at Career-Education Planning 
Services, 6th Floor, Bldg. 20, Muir College.

Watermelon Wipe Out 
Dana M. Rowley, the 9th annual Watermelon queen, will continue Revelle's oldest 

tradition today and drop a water-mellon off the top of Urey Hall. 
Rowley, a freshman girl at Revelle, was selected Wednesday to participate in the 

event. Four other freshman girls, laurie Davis, Zdenka Fromk, Denise Dizney and Jana 
Slute a will help her as "princesses". 

" Dropping a watermelon off the top of Urey Hall began back in 1965 by Revelle's first 
freshman class," according to Tom Shepard, . Shepard, a former A,S"president, is now a 
Del Mar City Councilman. 

He told the TRITON TIMES that this tradition began because all the students at 
Revelle were freshmen, enrolled in physics. On the final exam they had a kinematics 
problem about the trajectory of a watermelon falling of of Urey Hall. 

After the test the students got togethpr and picked a "queen" to actually perform this 
experiment off Urey Hall, then.brand-new. . 

Since then a queen has been selected each year to carry a watermelon up 7 flights of 
stairs and throw it on the ground between Urey and P.e. building . Each year the 
distance north and south, that the pieces of the watermellon fly is recorded. 

According to Shepard the record is held by the class of 1970. Their freshman queen 
threw a watermelon in 1966 and pieces were found 154 feet apart. But there is some 
controversy about this claim and some feel that people actually cheated and kicked 
pieces further out. 

The actual selection of the queen has changed through the years. Instead of the 
freshman physics class selecting the queen, ad hoc committees were formed. This year a 
number of people from the campus programming office made the decision . 

Rowley throw the watermellon at 1 o'clock today after a noon concert in the Revelle 
Plaza. The band will be "Almost like Flying". Following the drop 1,000 pounds of 
wate~mellon .will be served on the lawn behind Urey Hall to the spectators. 

ThIS event IS sponsored by the Revelle Committee on College Affairs and the Campu5 
Programming Board.

staff box - and also one of 
the most la sting. The stu-
dent governments ri se and 
fall, as do student service 
clubs and academic 
groups. Not to mention 
e rstwhile competitors. 

politics ar still s myopic 
and misguided - at least 
for me - but its coverage 
of "student life" is full , 
descriptive and delightful. 
Its artistic design has im-
proved immensely. Its in -
creased volume signals the 
po ssibility of the Trit on 
Daily. CI arly its vitality 
echoes the staff's dedica-
tion to learning and telling 
about he "aead mic com-
munity" and almost 
everything else. 

When the sun rises somewhere over UC here on 
Torrey Pines Mesa in the mornings, I wonder if many of 
us take time to watch the university community 
materialize. First contacts with the campus through the 
wooded gates of Revelle Park ing lots often finds the 
groundskeepers raking leaves, mowing grass, pruning 
trees, sweeping sidewalks, and collecting trash . Before 
seven-thirty, the only man that really experiences the 
quiet of the campus is the Unicop cruising silently on 
the service roads and around the abandoned roads that 
somehow still exist here. And then between 7:30 and 
8:00, there is a constant rise in the noise level. 

Automobiles come piling into the parking lots in 
hundreds, the student body hunts down its morning 
class (at least those who know the terrors of classes at 
8), a couple of jets from Miramar come in low to let you 
know they exist, and suddenly somewhere in the time 
span of 8 :10 and 8:.20 we all sit comfortably in the 
confusion and chaos one may refer to as "business as 
usual." It exists as easily as each of us may take one 
breath after another without too much thought of it. 

Walk out of your office or wander across the campus 
after class and take a look just for the sake of ex-
perience. Integrate your noises and then investigate 
them. If you look around enough mornings and stay 
around enough evenings after much of the noise 
subsides, you may wonder what this place was like five 
and ten years ago. Anf! if you wonder enough, you 
might discover the secrets of how the University 
honestly clicks and ticks. 

It 's not really surprising to say that what we may see 
in our walk or wander well reflects the background as 
well as the method of thought of our community. 
Questions easily posed as : does the community react 
wisely? Does the reaction reflect understanding of the 
inevitability of the evolutionary process the community 
is experiencing? Does the history silently recorded day 
by day around here go completely unrecognizedl 
often pass as questions. Unansweted. And for some this 
may be business as usual. 

The rabbits have gone in the wake of the University's 
growth. This has been the only reference I have used to 
judge the wisdom of the community. It 's not so much 
their disappearance but rather the reaction of those 
that know they are gone and watched the slow en-
croachment of the apathy and disorientation that 
seemed to almost dissolve the rabbits' will to stay 
around . They waivered under the noise of the con-
struction of the Med School and scattered with the 
finishing touches of the VA Hospital. 

I sometimes search my Being deep for feelings that 
like to speculate on the process that I witness each year 
in our community. Wf' grow and change, experience 
and understand. Yet many neglect their awareness that 
the true essence of living is being alive. The focal point 
of overheard conversations range from what's new in 
the vending machines to pointless hassles over working 
conditions. 

The seasons of the year come gently here on the 
Coast. So quiet and so linear are they that you have to 
almost keep a day to day account to really notice them. 
With the rabbits, you knew where you were at just by 
watching them. My speculation revolves around a trust 
in Man 's ability to influence the survival of his species 
and the quality of his life both on the planet as a whole 
and on the level as an individual. Thoreau felt that 
" most men lead lives of quiet desperation." Watching 
some of the faces I see during the day only reinforces 
this feeling . Yet early in the morning and later in the 
evenings are times unique here atop Torrey Pines 
Mesa. The main thing seems to be that life is not afraid 
to be human, though during the time for business as 
usual the people sometimes seem to build walls that 
destroy communications between each other. When 
they build their walls, I wonder if they know what 
they're walling in and what they're walling out. 

Man as a comprehensive unit of life on this planet is 
a kind of strength that seeks to have knowledge andto 
have understanding in the same breath. He is being 
called upon to develop ways and means for living with 
Himself and with other life. I sometimes wonder the 
path toward alienation that we seem to be veering 
toward in our attempts to investigate ways to make life 
count, for everything. It Is almost as if sometimes 
(through whatever methods chosen) as if we bury 
problems alive. 

Somewhere it's easy to conclude that the rabbits 
have gone into hiding or have just plain gone. But 
we're still around here. The University is growing 
slowly with all its pains and conflicts of so many 
different philosophies about how the world ticks. And 
as it grows those of us who go to school here, run the 
place, or help run it more often than not grow apart. I 
just think those of you In the University community 
should take the time to smile at those unknown faces 
and share your hellos. 

Become alive, cuz the person that each of us Is- is

Editor: 
To : A.P. Botts, 510 

Sir, in answer to your 
"Salaries Cut" letter in the 
Vol. 9 No.4 issue of our n : 

It is obvious that you are 
unfamiliar with the UCSD 
policy regarding hiring of 
staff employees. For you r 
edification: 

1) The Uni~ersity thrives 
on non-productivity. 

2) Qualifications for most 
positions include : 

a) must have Navy ex-
perience of at least 10 
years, but no indication of 
having learned any useful 
skill beyond swearing, 
rolling a cigarette in a sock 
shirt sleeve, or featherbed-
ding. 

b) must drink a minimum 
of 23 cups of coffee per day 
(preferably at the busiest 
times of the day) . 

3) The " Peter Principle" 
abounds. 

By spending a few weeks 
in anyone area, one can 
easily see how an 
egotistical professor (for 
example) will hire a 
qualified individual (see 2 
above) to run h is lab (for 
instance), knowing his new 
assistant doesn 't have the 
know-how to make 
decisions on his own, let 
alone ask relavent 
questions. This new man 
now directs his underlings 
who have less "feel" for 
what's going on - and (to 
make matters worse) lack 
the many years of service -
learning to pass the buck. 
Any person found doing an 
adequate job or (Admiral 
forbid) accomplishing too 
much before coffee time is 
demoted or fired . Thus 
keeping productivity at a 
constant "new" all time 
low. 

We would all do well to 
remember that the U of C 
has a responsibility to its 
local citizens. That is, to 
provide in competent 
coffee cuppers with high 
paying jobs which will not

Showly, 25, helped found 
and was news editor (1967-
68, 1969·70) of the TT,

Editor: 

For all the cri tici sm the 
IT (or as I used to call it, T-
squared) receives from 
students, faculty, ad -
ministrators and others, I 
still think it is doing a great 
job. On its sixth birthday 
th is past week (Vol. 1, No. 
1, May 26, 1967), con-
gratulations! 

Classroom work and all 
associated du ties, of 
course, are the primary 
purposes for going to 
school. Yet looking back 
after three years of non-
school life , all the hours I 
spe nt on the TT were 
equally important. 

If you seek "relevance," 
hardly anything can better 
fit the bill. Imagination, 
creativity, responsibility, 
gratification -a ll are there 
on the campus newspaper. 
Six months after 
memorizi ng the K rebb's 
Cycle - and promptly 
losing it in my memory 
bank - I could sti ll write a 
news stor y. Classroom 
knowledge is important 
only as long as one is able 
to relate it to the rest of 
one's experiences. Th e 
same is true to a greater 
degree with the activities 
students pursue outs ide 
the classroom. 

Obv iously UCSD 
students still believe the IT 
offers a chance to learn 
beyond the textbook. I can 
tell you and so can any of 
us who have stayed in the 
field - you won't regret it. 

Today's IT is still fu II of 
the joy of discovery that 
kept me from working 
harder on Dr. Armin Rap-
paport's assignments. Its 

On your sixth birthday, I 
sal ute you and look 
forward to many more 
issues in the years ahead.

1M Softball 

The Big Hit At UCSD 
Pat Stacy 

How does a UCSD 
student spend his time 
when his nose isn't 
buried in a book? The 
answer is easy for the 
team members of the 66 
coed and 48 mens in-
tramural softball squads. 
Spring quarter is softball 
time; nothing can beat a 
spring Saturday in the 
sun playing softball (ex-
cept, of course, when 
some thoughtful person 
remembers (0 bring 
some liquid 
refreshment), About this 
time of the quarter, the 
season is rawing to a 
close, playoffs are com-
ing , and the few 
remaining games really 
"count." But when you 
see a team like the 
SPRA WLERS in ecstasy 
because they only lost 
by two runs, it's easy to 
remember that in in-
tramurals you can lose 
every game and still 
have a winning season.

A Call For Justice ... 
Continued from Page 4 

people with peace symbols and ecology decals on 
their cars, that pull in and shop at Safeway, and when 
asked give some incredible bullshit about why they 
have to shop there. 

To the displayers of peace symbols, what makes you 
think that peace can be separated from social justicel 
Social justice is what the UFW has been seeking from 
the beginning. Its struggle against the big-money in-
terests has been a struggle of social justice-an attempt 
to give farmworkers a representative voice with their 
employer. This struggle continues up to this day and is 
now taking' place against Safeway S~ores Inc., the 
second largest chain store in the country. Safeway 
con tinues to market lettuce, grapes, and wines of 
corporate giants that have always disregarded the basic 
human rights of farmworkers. 

As for the seekers of "Ecology Now," you do not 
seem to realize that the UFW has always been opposed 
to the use of such pesticides as DDT, Parathion, and 
most recently the highly toxic pesticide, Monitor 4, 
which has been found on the lettuce that Safeway has 
been passing on to its customers. Both peace and 
ecology enthusiasts should realize that the only way 
you can begin to achieve yo.ur goals is by being 

Me E I roy ... 'ConI. from p."l 
first look for the "most 
qualified, and, all else 
being equal, will hire 
women and minoritie's." 
However, the Chancellor 
refuses to set a quota, 
preferring to follow "broad 
goals". 

McElroy complained 
that, even with equal 
qualifications, he receives 
unequa l response from 

available women . He said 
the collected data often is 
out of date and little infor-
mation exists on new PhD's 
(as opposed to tenured 
people .) He says he is 
asking committees to be 
sensitive and to not rely 
heavily on the "buddy 
system, " where friends 
recommend potential 
employees to other 
friends. 

New Grad Rules 

consistent by practicing what you preach by 
cooperating with the boycott. 

There is a high percentage of the counter-culture 
which apparently has no political orientation and 
shows little concern for their fellow human beings 
even after much persuasion on the part of UFW 

pic~ets . These are the people who have just got to have 
their wine because Safeway has a sale on it, and are no 
better than those members of the older generation that 
are apathetic and don't give a damn about anybody but 
themselves. 

There are also those people who exhibit those Jesus 
bumperstickers and decals. They who profess to have 
love for their brothers, seem to loose it when the ,,'alk 
talk to a UFW picket outside of Safeway, a place that for 
years has been partners in the exploitation of 
farmworkers. Th se people aren't Christiansi they are 
hypocrits, pure and simple. If they were Christians, 
they would r alize the morality 1nd legality of the 
farmworker struggle. They would realize that by not 
shopping at a Safeway, they could be the "Good 
Samaritan" in a struggle for social justice. 

By and large, most of the counter-culture and Jesus-
culture has been very helpful to the cause of the 
United Farmworkers Union. But there's an un-
acceptable high percentage of the counter-culture and 
Jesus-culture which is seriously hurting the United 
Farmworkers efforts and is undermining the credibility 
of the true counter-culture. To those in this category 
let us say this : If you can't actually find time to help us 
out by either picketing or leafleting, and if you un-
willing to co-operate with us by boycotting SafewaYi at 
least have the honesty to remove the peace symbols, 
ecology signs, and Jesus stickers from your cars.
