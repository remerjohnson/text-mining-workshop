FBI Arrests New Bomb-Hoax Suspect

By Jesse Alm

As wage and benefits negotiations 
between the California Nurses Association 
and the University of California carry 
into their ninth month, grievances from 
another union, the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees, 
regarding a contract for the university’s 
11,000 patient-care technical employees 
have further exacerbated the statewide 
debate over the university’s treatment of its 
medical workers.

The three-year contract, which will 
establish both wages and medical benefits 
for PCT employees — which includes den-
tal hygienists, respiratory therapists and 
nursing aids — has been on the bargain-
ing table since July 2007. Until recently, 
the university was reluctant to declare an 
impasse, claiming that there was still prog-
ress to be made.

“We felt that we had more to bar-
gain over,” said Nicole Savickas, human 
resources and labor coordinator for the 
UC Office of the President.

AFSCME Local 3299 President Lakesha 
Harrison, a licensed vocational nurse, said 
that if university officials were interested 
in making progress, they would have made 
it already.

“We have been there for months, and 
they have not made one significant pro-

posal,” she said.
Harrison said the wages for almost 

every job classification in her unit at UCLA 
are at least 25 percent below market level, 
creating a disturbingly high turnover rate. 

“Every time [new employees] come, 
I have to train them,” she said. “They are 
there for six months to a year, and then 
they say, ‘OK, now I can go to Kaiser.’ It is 
potentially dangerous to patient care when 
people are coming and going like that.” 

Among AFSCME’s initiatives are a $15 
state minimum wage for PCT employees, 
the elimination of pay cuts for health care 
and pension and the implementation of 
an annual automatic step system, which 
would inform employees up front of their 
scheduled raises for the duration of their 
contract.

Savickas said it would be fiscally irre-
sponsible for the university to implement 
these initiatives, which, according to a 
recent press release, would cost UC medi-
cal centers more than $75 million over 
the course of the contract. She said that 
many of the university’s other financial 
responsibilities, such as maintaining and 
improving current medical facilities and 
equipment, are often overlooked.

“We have our different budgets, and 
those have to be allocated across a bunch 
of different budgets,” she said.

Harrison criticized the university’s pri-
orities, saying that employee conditions 

should be considered before the facilities 
in which they work.

“It’s really bad to have a great facility 
and nobody to work there,” she said.

Local AFSCME representative Celene 
Perez said that even when minimal raises 
have taken effect, they have been under-
mined by hikes in separate areas such as 
health care and parking. She cited a recent 
UCSD proposal to raise the staff parking 
fee from $81to $100, a move she said illus-
trates the disconnect between the univer-
sity and its staff members’ basic needs.

“If you look at the top administration, 
they’re not really sure what’s going on,” 
Perez said. “They don’t understand how 
certain things need to be restructured to 
make things better.”

Jessica Agost, a surgical technologist 
at the UCSD Medical Center’s Thornton 
Hospital, said she is disappointed that after 
providing students with such an outstand-
ing education, the UC system fails to retain 
them as professional employees. 

“They don’t understand that the 
patients are the ones who suffer,” she said.

The California Public Employment 
Relations Board has approved the declara-
tion of an impasse, and a state-appointed 
mediator is scheduled to meet with both 
parties at the end of this month.

All in favor of champagne-infused 
sunsets and suds in the San Diego 
sun may be in luck. An organization 
opposed to recently approved ban 
prohibiting alcohol on all of the city’s 
beaches turned in nearly 46,000 sig-
natures to the City Clerk’s Office on 
Jan. 4, halting the prohibition pend-
ing a citywide vote.

The group — Ban the Ban 3 — had 
30 days to meet the 30,209-signature 
threshold to force the City Council to 
either repeal its November sanction 
of a one-year trial ban or to initiate a 
referendum to appear on the June or 
November ballot.

Volunteers and paid signature 
gatherers aimed to round up 75,000 
signatures protesting the ban but fell 
short because the 30 days fell over 
December, when many beach-area 
residents and college students were 
out of town for the holidays.

The group’s ability to collect 46,000 
signatures despite the cold weather 
and holiday-related restraints shows 
the support of local San Diegans, said 
Ban the Ban 3 organizer Jacob Pyle.

The City Clerk accepted the peti-
tion the same day the ban was to go 
into effect. The signatures were then 
sent to the county Registrar of Voters, 
which has 30 days to certify that sign-
ers are registered to vote in the city 
of San Diego. If enough signatures

The FBI made a second arrest last 
week in connection with December’s 
bomb threat against the Leichtag 
Biomedical Research Building, after 
determining that the original suspect 
was not involved in the hoax.

On Jan. 4, members of the Joint 
Terrorism Task Force arrested 54-
year-old Richard Sills Jr., a temporary 
Leichtag employee. Officials also dis-
missed all charges against 50-year-old 
former lab technician Timothy Bryon 
Kalka, who was arrested for the crime 
on Dec. 8. See ARREST, page 3

UC Struggles to Resolve Dual Union Negotiations

Sills is charged with conveying 
false or misleading information and 
engaging in hoax activities pertain-
ing to explosives. He was scheduled 
to appear before a judge on Jan. 8 but 
did not show, said Debra Hartman, 
media liaison for the San Diego U.S. 
Attorney’s Office.

Hartman said that Sills is currently 
a patient at Alvarado Hospital in East 
County, but could not disclose any 
other details. He is now expected to 
appear before the court on Jan. 14, 
she said.

Associate Vice Chancellor of 
University Communications Stacie A. 
Spector said that Sills was a temporary

are deemed valid, the petition will be 
sent to the City Council, which will 
have 10 days to decide its next move.

Ban supporters expressed disap-
pointment that the opposition did 
not give the trial prohibition a fair 
shot. They cited other areas from 
Imperial Beach to Ventura County, 
Hawaii, Florida and many urban 
beaches along the East Coast with 
similar measures as good examples 
of cities that have addressed public 
safety concerns arising from beach 
alcohol consumption.

“These cities have all made the 
decision that public safety requires 
an alcohol-free beach policy and, to 
my knowledge, none of these cities 
put public safety to vote,” said Scott 
Chipman, a spokesman for the Web 
site www.safebeaches.org.

Chipman also mentioned the 
alcohol-free policy at La Jolla Shores, 
which was implemented 17 years ago 
without generating a referendum.

Ban the Ban 3 members fought 
the regulation because they did not 
think it addressed any of the relevant 
issues, Pyle said. He called the mea-
sure overly punitive, without estab-
lishing parameters or responding to 
the recommendations set forth by 
the Beach Area Alcohol Task Force 
commissioned by Councilman Kevin 
Faulconer after the Labor Day skir-
mish that motivated the initiative.

“You don’t take the most punish-
ing step first,” he said. “Let’s punish

the 1 percent of people causing prob-
lems, not the rest of the law-abiding 
citizens, enjoying the beaches as they 
are ... they’re not just interested in 
beach alcohol, they have a bigger 
agenda.”

Pyle argued that the majority of 
issues brought up by ban supporters 
— such as urinating in public and 
DUIs — don’t revolve around beach 
alcohol. He attributed the public uri-
nation problem in Pacific Beach to 
the fact that there are only six operat-
ing toilets at the site, and he said that 
most DUIs occur during late-night 
hours when beach alcohol is pro-
hibited.

Proponents of the ban, however, 
note that people are increasingly com-
ing to Pacific and Mission beaches to 
be a part of the “alcohol scene” that 
takes place there, said Chipman, who 
served on the Beach Area Alcohol 
Task Force. While beer bongs, alco-
hol luges and drinking games are not 
permitted at bars or nightclubs, they 
are commonplace at the beach, where 
there is no one to regulate if someone 
is binge drinking or when underage 
kids try to join the games, he said.

“Unfortunately, there is no practi-
cal way to allow one person to drink 
responsibly without letting many oth-
ers drink irresponsibly,” Chipman said.

The Ban the Ban 3 petition echoes 
efforts of previous years, in which 
two other trial bans were successfully 
defeated.

City Council Has Tried, Failed 
Twice to Implement Full Ban

▶ BAN, from page 1 In 1991, the City Council approved 
a one-year trial ban but rescinded its 
decision when opponents gathered 
enough signatures for a referendum. 
The city compromised by restricting 
drinking between 8 p.m. and noon.

In 2002, the council attempted 
to impose an around-the-clock trial 
ban on parts of Pacific and Mission 
beaches, which failed by a slim 3-per-
cent margin.

While the prospective success of a 
ban may look dismal when consider-
ing past efforts, times have changed, 
according to Chipman. He added that 
problems are worse now than ever, 
diverting city resources and forcing 
law enforcement to “babysit” drink-
ers at the beach rather than protect 
city streets.

The idea that people need to be 
babysat is precisely the problem, 
according to Pyle, who maintained 
that drinking-related problems occur 
within a small two-block stretch, and 
that the majority of San Diego locals 
enjoy their liberties responsibly with-
out necessitating police intervention.

“I think the bigger principle is that 
San Diegans are sick of the nanny 
state our government is making us 
live in,” Pyle said. “Heck, if they had 
their way, we’d each have a govern-
ment-assigned nanny following us 
around to correct everything we are 
doing wrong.”

THURSDAY, JANUARY 10, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  3

The A.S. Council reconvened for its first meeting of the new year without the tension and heated 
exchanges to which it was accustomed 
in 2007.

In the two meetings leading up to 
the break, members argued vociferous-
ly over funding college-specific events 
and the council’s failure to show up for 
the La Jolla Christmas Parade. 

Last night’s 45-minute meeting, the 
shortest yet, did lit-
tle to address these 
lingering issues. 
Perhaps the eggnog 
and good cheer 
from the three-
week vacation have 
yet to wear off.

Amy Ifurung 
of the Women’s Commission began the 
meeting during public input to update 
the council on the philanthropic efforts 
of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. The 
sorority was seeking two dashing A.S. 
Council models to be immortalized in 
a fundraising calendar.

At the previous meeting, Associate 
Vice President of Academic Affairs 
Long Pham and Vice President of 
External Affairs Dorothy Young 
walked away with the council’s nomi-
nations for calendar models, but 
Pham declined the offer and Young 
was unable to participate because of a 
scheduling conflict.

Although Muir College Chair Dave 
Payne volunteered to model, the coun-
cil held a second vote to nominate 
Associate Vice President of College 
Affairs Tanya Piyaratanaphipat to fill 
the remaining spot. 

Former council president Harry 
Khanna, now a graduate student at 
Johns Hopkins University, also spoke 
during public input. He urged council 
members to resist a recommendation 
from last year’s Sun God Report to 
move the festival from mid-May to 

late April. 
Khanna said that discouraging stu-

dents from nearby schools from attend-
ing Sun God by moving it further away 
from summer would also make it hard-
er for alumni to attend.

Khanna also spoke in favor of an 
amendment to implement instant 
runoff voting for council elections, 
a method that allows students to 
rank multiple candidates when vot-

ing on TritonLink,  
instead of choos-
ing only one can-
didate.

In an e-mail 
sent to coun-
cilmembers in 
December, Khanna 
wrote that IRV will 

help prevent elections from merely 
turning into competitions between two 
slates of candidates.

In its only substantive action of 
the night, the council passed the IRV 
amendment without objection.

Thurgood Marshall College Senator 
Kyle Samia kept his “fabulous parade” 
pet project alive by suggesting the cre-
ation of a parade planning task force to 
investigate potential routes and partici-
pants and formulate a report for next 
year’s council. However, the fabulosity 
remains far off in the horizon.

Facing a dearth of important busi-
ness, councilmembers exchanged the 
usual tidbits of oddball information 
during open forum.

Eleanor Roosevelt College Senator 
Stephanie Usry, either to update com-
puter-less students or to taunt the blind, 
promoted the recent redesign of the 
UCSD Web site and TritonLink.

Catering to the council’s closet gam-
ers, Sixth College Senator Micah Jones 
plugged this weekend’s video game 
competition, Winter Gamefest. Jones 
did not indicate whether he would par-
ticipate in the “pwning” himself.

animal-rights activist group the Animal 
Liberation Front, which demanded the 
release of all research animals in cam-
pus laboratories. If the university did 
not comply, the letter said, multiple 
explosive devices would be detonated.

Jerry Vlasak of the Animal 
Liberation Press Office, an organiza-
tion that fields anonymous messages 
from ALF members and publicly advo-
cates for animal-rights reform, said he 
did not know if the incident was com-
mitted by an ALF affiliate.

“We know there are animals being 
tortured at UC San Diego, and we 
know there are people willing to risk 
their lives and their freedom to stop it,” 
Vlasak said. “Whether this was perpe-
trated by ALF, we don’t really have any 
firsthand knowledge.”

Vlasak said the threat initially 
appeared to be the work of ALF mem-
bers, but the recent emergence of “dis-
gruntled employees” made him uncer-
tain of its authenticity.

He also said that ALPO does not 
know the identities of ALF members, 
but that Sills is not a known animal-
rights activist.

Kalka was arrested based on tips 
from individuals who listened to 
recorded television and radio broad-
casts of the threat, along with a con-
current JTTF investigation, according 
to an FBI press release. He had been 
terminated from his position on Nov. 
30 after working at UCSD for eight 
years. 

However, further investigation 
exonerated Kalka and implicated Sills, 
according to the FBI.

No evidence linking Sills to ALF has 
been released to the media.

After examining the results of this week’s New Hampshire primaries and last week’s 
Iowa caucuses, it’s easy to see why 
many media outlets have dubbed this 
year’s contest the “Facebook elec-
tion.”

Historically, it’s not a big secret 
that the under-30 crowd is often 
noticeably absent from the nation’s 
voting bloc. It’s also no secret that 
candidates tend to court issues that 
relate to older voters, which is why 
older voters have always dominated 
the polls.

But with this year’s presidential 
election being the most open contest 
for the White House since 1928 — 
the last time there was no incumbent 
president or vice president seeking 
a nomination — candidates, both 
Democratic and Republican, have 
made it a priority to tap into the 
youth vote.

Thanks largely to popular social 
networking site Facebook, which 

teamed up with ABC News to sponsor 
televised presidential debates — even 
splaying its very recognizable logo on 
candidates’ podiums — young voters 
have turned out in droves in both the 
Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire 
primaries. As a result, their participa-
tion has been crucial to propelling 
candidates to victory.

According to exit polls, in New 
Hampshire alone more than 72,000 
voters between the ages of 18 and 
30 took part in the state’s primaries, 
which is about double the number 
who voted four years ago. And in 
Iowa, about 65,000 young voters 
participated in the state’s caucuses, 
about three times the number who 
participated in 2004. 

But Facebook’s influence hasn’t 
been confined solely to the podi-
um. The Web site also offers debate 
forums where users can discuss can-
didates’ key issues, as well as real-
time news and video streaming from 
the campaign trail. In addition, the 

site features profile pages specific 
to each candidate, where users can 
publicly display support.

Facebook’s sponsorship of the 
election process has undoubted-
ly given young voters a chance to 
mobilize active political engagement, 

and by reaching out to young voters 
with familiar technology, candidates 
have finally given them a reason to 
become excited about the political 
process. As the race for the White 
House narrows, these efforts must 
continue.

Had this been just another failing urban school, no one would have made these accu-
sations.”

When Preuss School Board of 
Directors Chair Cecil Lytle made this 
comment defending the integrity of 
UCSD’s nationally recognized char-
ter school against allegations of grade 
tampering, he was also inadvertently 
exposing its Achilles’ heel. Since its 
inception in 1999, the school has stock-
piled accolades, including recent slots 
in Newsweek and U.S. News and World 
Report’s lists of the top 10 high schools 
in the nation. However, judging by 
the results of the recent UCSD audit 
of the school’s operations — which 
unearthed multiple instances of admin-
istrative mismanagement, including 
altered transcripts suspiciously miss-
ing the initial grade entry forms — it’s 
clear that the abundance of acclaim was 
accompanied by an unhealthy dose of 
managerial complacency.

Even if none of the 427 grade altera-
tions were deliberate — a very unlikely 
scenario, according to the auditors — it 
doesn’t retroactively absolve Preuss 
administrators for allowing these prob-
lems to go unnoticed for many years. 
As a self-proclaimed model for urban 
education, the school’s leaders should 
have reasonably foreseen the dangers of 
lax management, particularly regarding 
their students’ grades. Lytle was correct 
in acknowledging that charter-school 
skeptics are a dime a dozen — all the 

more reason why there should have 
been double- and triple-checks in place 
to ensure that there were no closeted 
skeletons that the reporters flocking 
around Preuss have now uncovered.

Ex-Principal Doris Alvarez, waging 
a media campaign against the auditors 
for implicating her in the grade-chang-
ing process, has inferred that the uni-
versity’s post-audit disciplinary actions 
may not have happened at a time 
when the school was less visible on the 
national radar. However, UCSD’s strong 
stance against documented cheating is 
the only acceptable recourse for such 
reprehensible actions.

Had Preuss administrators peri-
odically performed their own internal 
audits, or even just kept a closer eye on 
their lower-level employees, the scandal 
never would have snowballed into such 
a public-relations nightmare. Instead, 
a former registrar was allowed access 
to her son’s transcripts, which she later 
admitted to altering. Instead, Alvarez 
chose to terminate Jennifer Howard, 
an ex-teacher who was testifying in the 
ongoing audit at the time her contract 
was up for renewal. Instead, the Board 
of Directors allowed Alvarez to take the 
wheel, failing to realize the implications 
of these decisions until the university’s 
audit was all but inevitable. By turning 
a blind eye to its own operations, the 
Preuss School did its bright, hardwork-
ing students an undeniable disservice.

Now that the captain of the way-
ward ship has resigned, however, Preuss 

is making strides in the long process of 
rebuilding its national standing and the 
community’s faith. Alvarez’s successor 
will have undoubtedly learned many 
lessons from this unfortunate situation, 
but perhaps the most important moral 
is the necessity of constant internal vig-
ilance — even when nothing appears to 
be amiss. Preuss is not a failing urban 
school, but a successful educational 
prototype that has been temporarily 
derailed from its upward track. While it 
is unfortunate that the university must 
uphold its dedication to integrity and 
personal responsibility through puni-
tive measures, continuing to adhere to 
these values is the only way that UCSD 
can return Preuss to the high regard 
that it could — and should — occupy.

I can’t believe that I am about to vote in a presidential election for the very first time in my life and 
honestly, I’m not really all that excited 
about it. Yeah, democratic participation 
is great and I like voicing my opinions 
via ballot box, but I can’t seem to shake 
this feeling of resigned pessimism. 

After watching the fraudulent 
unfolding of the 2000 election from 
the sidelines as a curious but contently 
ignorant seventh grader, I decided to 
take a more active role in 2004 and 
campaigned for the Democratic Party. 
At the time, I had the moral dilemma 
of supporting a party that stood in 
contrast to many personal beliefs, but 
justified it by focusing on the need 
for any type of political change away 
from those first four years of the Bush 
administration. Imagine the horrible 
feeling of a high school junior after he 
reluctantly campaigned for a candidate 
he didn’t truly want who ended up los-
ing anyway. 

It was in that moment that I formed 
the belief that the next four years in 
our country were doomed, but would 
hopefully result in a public so discon-
tent with recent politics that it would 
clamor for a new wave of change to 
sweep over American society. Although 
public opinion of the current adminis-
tration, the Iraq War and the president 
are at an all-time low, the overall sense 
of creating profound change in our 
country is not apparent in the 2008 
presidential hopefuls. 

From the point of view of running 
a nation, most presidential candidates 
are still relatively inexperienced, which 
leaves them no option but to dumb 
down their policies and filibuster in 
hopes of being elected. It is ironic that 
the only candidates on both sides of the 
political spectrum who are unrelenting 
in sticking to their beliefs are those 
who honestly have no hope of even 
making it past the primaries. The sad

Preuss Struggles to Make Grade Following Preventable Scandal
Presidential 
Elections a 

Long-Awaited 
Letdown

NATIONAL NEWS — With its status 
as the sixth most visited Web site in 
the United States with over 58 million 
active users, Facebook has become 
one of the most widely used network-
ing sites on the Internet. 

But in addition to connecting 
users from colleges across the country, 
allowing friends to share messages, 
photos and videos and enabling stu-
dents to compare movie and music 
tastes with the click of a mouse, this 
popular social tool has also become a 

Petri dish for research scientists across 
the nation. This means that any cur-
rent Facebook users who haven’t acti-
vated certain privacy options could 
easily find themselves under the scru-
tiny of a researcher’s microscope. 

Psychologists, political scientists 
and sociologists from universities 
nationwide, including Harvard and 
UCLA, have been eagerly testing tra-
ditional theories in relationships, iden-
tity, self-esteem, popularity, race and 
political engagement using Facebook 
— taking advantage of the candidly 
honest and unprotected profiles of 
thousands of students.

In a recent issue of the New York 
Times, Nicholas Christakis, a Harvard 
professor currently using Facebook to 
research social relationships, hailed 
the use of the popular social network-
ing tool in studies. 

Though professors may be excited 
about their newfound ability to pry 
into students’ online profiles, many of 

their subjects haven’t been as equally 
thrilled. Moreover, if it weren’t for 
certain students’ neglect to adjust their 
privacy settings in the first place, many 
professors still would not have access 
to that information today. 

With the exception of a few 
schools like Indiana University, which 
has strict policies barring academic 
research without the permission of 
students, many Facebook users who 
are under analysis have absolutely no 
idea that their profiles are being stud-
ied. But, according to Facebook’s terms 
of use, this is completely permissible. 
Currently, there is no policy prohibit-
ing scholars — or virtually any person 
for that matter — from studying the 
profiles of users who haven’t activated 
the necessary privacy settings. 

Predictably, using students’ 
thought-to-be personal information 
as public data strikes many students 
as disreputable, especially considering 
that in many cases, these students are 

not even informed that their informa-
tion is being used in the first place. 

Not every student has the common 
sense to keep their personal informa-
tion off the Internet, but this doesn’t 
mean they are willing to participate 
in experimental studies of which they 
have no prior knowledge.

“Conducting research without 
the user’s consent is unethical,” said 
D.M.   Hallowell, who holds a mas-
ter’s degree in higher education from  
and updates his fellow scholars in 
his journal “Educational Theory and 
Pedagogy,” concerning educational 
theory. “[Terms of security] agree-
ments have nothing to do with it.”

Besides the issue of collecting 
information without a user’s consent, 
researchers are also at fault for using 
information that was not intended 
to be employed for investigative pur-
poses to begin with. 

“People who participate in 
Facebook do so for social [and] per-

sonal reasons,” Hallowell said. “There 
is no intent that their information will 
be used in any other way.” 

Since many students don’t realize 
they are signing up to be research sub-
jects by neglecting to privatize their 
profiles, more schools should follow 
Indiana University’s example and 
enforce stricter policies for academic 
researchers. Without consent from 
students, universities should not allow 
researchers to use students’ profiles for 
their studies.

Although others may argue that 
once information is available on the 
Internet, it becomes fair game for any-
one to use, this is not a worthy stan-
dard for researchers. Simply because 
a student has an online account does 
not imply that their information can 
be used for  purposes of investigation.

If privacy and ethical issues aren’t 
big enough deterrents for Facebook-

Loft Could Bring Unique 
Spin on Campus Social Life
Dear Editor, 

I am writing in regard to James 
Yoon’s article “Despite Lofty Ambitions, 
Upcoming Campus Nightclub Misses 
Mark,” in which he degrades the Loft 
as being “overly artistic and mature” 
for undergraduate students. Rather 
than presenting an eloquent argument, 
Yoon contributes to the “apathetic” 
and “socially dead” campus climate he 
criticizes. Such hypocrisy is inherent 
within the article, as Yoon begins by 
describing “the administration’s ear-
nest effort to respond to concerns 
over the lack of an on-campus com-
munity.” He complains about how the 
“extremely small” space for 130 people, 
along with the possibility of having 
an interactive iPod jukebox, wine bar 
and LCD screen, would undermine 
the on-campus undergraduate experi-
ence. Rather than “alienating and pos-
sibly irritating students,” the intimate 
setting of the Loft would encourage 
true social dialogue. The opportunity 
to converse with the people who are 
playing their music or even share one’s 
own is great for meeting new people. 
Having experienced the small house 
concerts hosted by Sixth College in 
which students can take turns sharing 
their favorite music, I know that the 
programs available at the Loft would 
encourage a cultural exchange and 
foster new friendships. 

“The overly artistic and mature 
environment of the Loft also poses an 
issue as it fails to serve diverse audi-
ences … too fancy and over-the-top 
for many college-age undergraduates,” 
Yoon argues. He adds that the Loft 
would only serve a specific niche of 
the undergraduate population, when 
in truth it has the potential to provide 
a plethora of eclectic programming 
(one only has to look at the ArtPower! 
2007-08 season to see the artists that 
are already scheduled to perform). I 

believe that the undergraduate years 
are the most important time to take 
advantage of the myriad of cultural 
events that are available here at UCSD. 
Yoon’s assumption that the under-
graduate population is too ignorant 
to enjoy such a venue is offensive and 
invalid. The undergraduate popula-
tion will continue to view the Loft as 
“too nice,” if they are unable to enjoy 
the upcoming events. Yoon represents 
the quotidian bourgeois who become 
unsettled when something new comes 
along outside materialistic values or 
conventional attitudes.

The Loft will be a new space on 
campus unlike anything UCSD has 
ever seen. It is important that students 
not only enjoy what the Loft has to 
offer, but also the multitude of events 
put on by A.S. Programming and 
other campus organizations. UCSD is 
a university that requires the student 
to be actively involved in discovering 
what he wants to engage in. Yoon’s 
article, and opinions like it, contribute 
to the negative stigma of UCSD being 
moribund. Enjoy the Super Smash 
Bros. tournaments as I look forward 
to socializing with my fellow students 
at the Loft.

election much more nerve-wracking 
and worrisome than I could have ever 
imagined. 

The way I see it, the 2008 presi-
dential election leaves me with three 
choices of action, all of which frustrate 
me to no end: I can “throw away 
my vote” on a fantastic liberal candi-
date who has less chance of winning 
than Stephen Colbert, I can go against 
everything that I stand for by voting 
Republican or I can sell my soul by vot-
ing for one of the leading Democratic 
candidates.

A few months ago I had the oppor-
tunity to hear Democratic presiden-
tial hopeful Dennis Kucinich speak 
at a small event hosted by a UCSD 
professor. There, a small group heard 
the representative from Ohio give an 
impassioned speech detailing his views 
on the necessity of complete politi-
cal change, and the truth that he is 
the only candidate advocating such a 
necessary transformation in American 
society. Hearing Kucinich attack the 
war, HMOs, anti-labor laws and restric-
tions on public education inspired me 
to want to vote for him, but it also 
depressed me, knowing that he was 
only this generation’s Ralph Nader — a 
man with great intentions and heart, 
but no chance of ever winning the 
White House.  

Is it that candidates like Mr. 

Kucinich, Cynthia McKinney and 
Leonard Peltier are simply morally 
superior to their opposition, believ-
ing in policies that are more genu-
ine and more beneficial to society? 
Or is it that their inherent role as the 
underdog gives them an unobstructed 
opportunity to voice their opinions? 
If Barack Obama were the little guy of 
the Democratic Party, would he stop 
contradicting himself on issues of for-
eign policy? Would he have been more 
anti-war from the get-go of his political 
career? Why is it that in order to have 
any hope of political success, a candi-
date must abandon the majority of his 
or her core beliefs? Sadly, for any of 
the honest feelings lurking deep down 
inside all presidential candidates, the 
static two-party system that America 
has adopted allows for no wiggle room 
or distinctiveness, and politicians are 
forced to either meander along party 
lines or lose. 

Fortunately, as a liberal citizen of 
California I am allowed to play a card 
that my fellow progressives in other 
parts of the country cannot: I can 
use the racist Electoral College system 
to my advantage. Under our current 
system, which was originally imple-
mented to appease the slave-owning 
Southern states, my vote does not mat-
ter. Instead, all that matters is the way 
the majority of my state votes. This 
means that we blue-staters can safely 

assume our electoral votes will all go to 
the Dems, giving us full license to vote 
for whomever we please. This strategy 
eases our conscience without changing 
the election.

But voting in this manner feels 
like a concession, and will anger many 
people, reviving the popular chant of 
“a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush.” 
That’s bullshit. 

While our administration is cur-
rently forcing democracy on countries 
all around the world, it is unbelievably 
hypocritical for our own citizens to be 
denied that same democracy. To me, 
democracy means a government that 
serves the people, not the other way 
around. Forcing people to capitulate 
their vote only proves that our govern-
ment and current political systems are 
the true bosses of the American public. 

So to hell with how we’re “supposed 
to vote”! Don’t think about any out-
come of your vote beyond the immedi-
ate tally for your candidate. Vote for 
whichever politician appeals the most 
to you, regardless of party affiliation, 
race, gender or predicted chance of 
victory. This is America, and we are a 
proud, stubborn and passionate coun-
try, so let your voice ring loud and 
hold your head up high on that glori-
ous march to the ballot box, where 
your vote will be a perfect reflection of 
nothing but yourself and all that you 
stand for.

based research, scientists shoulc also 
consider the skewed data that online 
profiles provide. Because it is a social 
tool, students often aren’t completely 
sincere in their profiles. Inside jokes, 
embellishments and fake marriages 
are just a few of the phony statistics 
that researchers would be incorporat-
ing into their studies if they were to 
treat typical Facebook falsehoods as 

facts. 
Unlike traditional data collection, 

online social profiles are being stud-
ied without users’ consent and are 
employed for purposes other than 
those that their users intended. It is 
far more acceptable for researchers 
to continue with traditional means 
of gathering information, rather than 
prying into college students’ online 
social networking tools where their 

statistical scrutiny is unwelcome. 
Professors and researchers should 

stick with paid surveys and case stud-
ies when it comes to social science 
— just because Facebook is an easily 
accessible pool of data doesn’t mean 
that unwitting student users should be 
exploited for experimental purposes.

“The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”

LANDMARK HILLCREST / NOW PLAYING

Who would’ve predicted that a movie 
about a  bed-confined stroke victim would 
sweep the prestigious Cannes Film Festival 
off its feet, scoring awards for both director 
Julian Schnabel (“Before Night Falls”) 
and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski 
(“Schindler’s List”)? A largely visual 
take on the life-defining paralysis of Elle 
magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby. 

“The Diving Bell and the Butterfly” is 
praised as one of 2007’s best foreign films, 
a sweeping drama that is acutely realistic: 
neither attempting to sugarcoat with the 
assurance of a happy ending, or overload 
with hyperbolic displays of tearful sulking. 
Instead, it extracts a moving portrait of one 
woman’s pain and creativity amid her utter 
isolation. (CM)

As the wise Dr. Tobias Funke 
once said, “I just blue myself,” and 
now you can too because the Blue 
Man Group (not the support group) 
is drumming its way to the SD 
Sports Arena. In this incarnation of 
their live act, the group embarks 
on a “fist-pumping rock-concert 
journey,” wearing flashy outfits 
and wiling out to an eight-piece 
backing band. For those who aren’t 
familiar with their typical shenani-
gans, the blue boys demonstrate 

their percussive abilities on a vari-
ety of makeshift PVC instruments 
and other odd devices. Some may 
write them off as a gimmick, but 
their day-glo Stomp show capti-
vates crowds with sensory overload 
and cool tones. Bespectacled DJ 
Mike Relm warms up the peeps 
with his genre-mixing scratch 
set, accompanied by spazzy car-
toon background visuals. Children 
under the age of two are free if 
sitting on lap. (CK)

A YEAR FOR
GLOBETROTTERS

& SLOW-BURNERS

D id anyone else feel like this year was 1996 all over again? Except instead of “Independence Day,” 
we had “Transformers,” “I Am Legend,” 
Spider-Man/Pirates/Bourne/Potter 
sequels, “The Simpsons” (someone put 
an end to this spider-pig crap, already) 
and just about every multi-million dol-
lar franchise imaginable that gave us 
the explosions and car chases we’ve 
pined for this entire decade. 

But while the average audience’s 
intellect sunk with every new release, 
there were more than a handful of 
great nuggets to feast on. Established 
directors like Todd Haynes and Martin 
Scorsese explored new territory, while 
others, like Paul Thomas Anderson and 
David Fincher, completely reinvented 
their styles.

Depending on your taste, 2007 was 
either the year with something for 
everyone, or an artistic rite of passage 
for the new-century filmmaker. Here 
are the top 13 films of that hypocritical 
year. Why not 10? Thirteen is just a 
better number.

It may be sort of a cop-out to include a 
short film that’s technically a wine commer-
cial, but when Martin Scorsese controls the 
action, it’s no normal ad. The Oscar-winner 
goes for laughs as he films “lost Hitchcock 
material” in Alfred’s style — stark Technicolor, 
dizzying music, blonde bombshells and a mil-
lion allusions to the master of suspense’s most 
famous scenes. It’s not a Scorsese film, per se; 
rather, it’s a Hitchcock film by Scorsese.

Having penned ambitious screen-
plays for the likes of Stevens Spielberg 
and Soderbergh, it seemed only natural 
that Scott Frank would embark on his 
own directorial adventure at some point. 
That his freshman vehicle would be the 
psychological noir “The Lookout,” a film 
laden with hidden motives and betray-
als in the midst of Midwestern frostbite, 
shows signs of good things to come. Even 

more revelatory is Joseph 
Gordon-Leavitt, who  plays 
the mentally challenged pro-
tagonist tricked into a bank 
heist, keeping his character 
distanced just enough for us 
to sympathize with his help-
lessness. In a genre notoriously 
full of cheap gimmicks and 
quick fixes, the story relies on 
pure tension.

Not even Eddie Murphy’s fat suit 
or Dane Cook’s frat-guy grandstanding 
could keep Judd Apatow from usurp-
ing this year’s comedy throne, with 
two major grand slams (“Knocked Up” 
and “Superbad”) and one minor strike 
(“Walk Hard”). But no one remembers 
the other Apatow-produced biting net-
work television satire from early on — Jake 
Kasdan’s “The TV Set.” A bleeding-heart 
writer (David Duchovny) watches his pas-

A real music critic might tackle critiques with a sit-and-listen session. But the common listener considers an artist’s 
whole package. A bit tasteless, sure, but pop culture 
demands different parameters than professional 
musical criticism: dance ability, fashion sense and 
fine-ness are the guidelines for slapdash reviewers 
like me. I mean, jeez, who solely relies on talent 
anymore?

1. Diva of the Year — Rihanna vs. Beyonce
Beyonce stumbled into 2007 after a well-pub-

licized episode of “Dreamgirls” drama. Co-star 
Jennifer Hudson outshined and out-sang the 
Texan darling all the way to Oscar stardom before 
Beyonce, along with her R&B stock, took a lit-
eral diva-sized dive onstage during her global tour. 
Rihanna has shown more finesse than that this 
year, especially on tabletops, where she put the fat-
test cherry atop Chris Brown’s rowdy performance 
at the MTV Video Music Awards. From table to 
table, the dancehall diva looked damn fine trot-
ting and grooving to “Umbrella”: those lace-trim 
baby shorts, off-center hat and nude-color fishnets 
sealed a Good Girl Gone Bad image that had every 
DJ screaming “-ELLA, -ELLA, -ELLA.”
Verdict: Rihanna, for not eating stage pavement.
Up Next: Watch that rear view, Rihanna. Beyonce’s 
third studio album is slated for 2008, with sev-
eral tracks backed by producing credits from the 
untouchable Timbaland. If he does for Knowles 

what he did for Justin 
Timberlake, a veteran like 
Beyonce should rip her 19-
year-old rival with a comeback.

2. A-Town Rap Refrain — Yooou! 
(Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em) vs. Aaaay! 
(The-Dream)

Up from the South come a couple of 
2007’s most shamefully addictive buzz-
sounds. Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em and The-
Dream, both Atlantan musicians, made 
their pop-radio hits infectious, the for-
mer with “Crank Dat” and the latter 
with “Shawty is Da Shit.” As expect-
ed, there were no musical epipha-
nies to be had: The songs were either overly 
silly (See: “Crank Dat” dance) or borderline 
insulting (The-Dream sings: “If she fix you eggs 
and grits in the morning/ Man, you should tip 
her”). Nah, these songs’ biggest draws were their 
relentless refrains, weaved in, out and through 
both artists’ albums: The-Dream’s “Love Hate” 
and Soulja Boy’s self-titled effort. What’s a song 
without a hard hook for every car-riding fan to 
stupidly imitate?
Verdict: Aaaay!, for sounding slightly less 
annoying.

Panda Bear — Person Pitch 
Animal Collective appendage Noah 

Lennox’s saccharine sample collage takes the 
number one spot for a few reasons: No other 
record this year captured warmth and hon-
est innocence with such labored craftsman-
ship. The Beach Boys redux vocals, gobs 
of reverb, saturated hand claps and milky 
dub reggae beats 
reach a state of 
classic pop man-
tra. Layers upon 
layers of thunder-
ous field record-
ings fade in at 
pivotal moments 
throughout the 
album to heighten 
its themes of friendship, not thinking too 
much and being comfortable. Delayed melo-
dies bubble into the foreground and disap-
pear just as quickly. By the record’s end, we’ve 
forgotten that it was made by one person on 
a computer, fully immersing ourselves in the 
playful, sentimental wall of sound. All our 
worries melt away.

Radiohead — In Rainbows 
Finally Radiohead muster up the 

courage not to hide behind lumbering elec-
tronics, instead embracing their accumulated 
musical wisdom to craft a naturally gorgeous 
record, stripped to its bare essence. It seems 
the Oxford five-piece laughed about heavy 
next-album pressures, had themselves a tea 
break, and got down to the creative pro-
cess. In Rainbows is more about collective 
groove than singular virtuosity; guitar noo-
dling is largely 
put on the back-
burner, save for 
“Bodysnatchers,” 
and instead the 
band members 
lose their defined 
roles in an effort 
to emphasize ten-
sion and mood,

Villainous Epic Bleeds Brilliance 

By Chris Mertan
Associate Hiatus Editor

S itting with eyelids yanked back and muscles paralyzed at the image of Daniel Day-Lewis collapsed at 
a bowling alley, you feel foolhardy 
to even attempt to wrap your mind 
around “There Will Be Blood.” 

There’s a sense that you’ve experi-
enced something brilliant on a cosmic 
scale, and yet it will take days, even 
weeks, to begin understanding this 
tightly coiled epic. You will compare 
it to Kubrick’s “2001” for its breadth, 
then Coppola’s “The Godfather” for 
its subtleties, Orson Welles’ “Citizen 
Kane” for its themes, and countless 
other masterpieces before realizing 
that to liken Paul Thomas Anderson’s 
new, ambitious tale of madness to any 
cinematic forefathers defeats its genius. 
Every way you turn to describe, or cat-
egorize, or even summarize, morphs 
into a dead end. You’re back at square 
one: the film. 

Adapted from Upton Sinclair’s 
minor novel “Oil!,” “There Will Be 
Blood” finds Sinclair’s portrayal of cut-
throat greed intact and its overly social-
ist underpinnings ditched in favor of a 
duel between the Almighty and the 
almighty dollar. Day-Lewis (“Gangs of 
New York”) is Daniel Plainview, a self-
made oil tycoon who travels the West at 
the turn of the century, swallowing up 
townships to increase his growing taste 

for all things with a price tag. When he 
arrives at Little Boston, a small com-
munity with oil prospects, Plainview is 
faced with young nemesis Eli Sunday 
(Paul Dano, who casts off the indie 
shackles of “Little Miss Sunshine” to 
shine as a bona fide actor), the town’s 
seemingly humble preacher, hiding 
his own thirst for power and money 
behind the cross and a self-proclaimed 
ability to heal.

There’s no saving grace to Plainview, 
no Achilles heel that explains his bitter, 
miserly pathos, which, as he acknowl-
edges, puts in him a competition against 
everyone. Of course, almost no one 
else sees this when Plainview, in public, 
puts on a kind, fatherly face, paint-
ing himself as a “family man” (thanks 
to his adopted son, H.W., remarkably 
realized by newcomer Dillon Freasier) 
and a businessman who respects small 
town values. 

Behind the scenes, he’s an astute 
oil shark able to steer clear of his 
superiors’ cons while using the same 
tactics to swindle the everymen 
below. Anderson spends the screen 
time building up Plainview’s layers 
(and Sunday’s, to a lesser extent), 
either masking or revealing the 
insanity within. One brilliant choice 
he made to achieve this is the clas-
sically abstract score by Radiohead’s 
Jonny Greenwood, which teeters on 
Kubrick homage yet serves primarily 
as a peek inside Plainview’s mind. 

Ultimately, the film is a grand exer-
cise for Anderson, breaking away 
from his past soul in “Boogie Nights” 
and “Magnolia” without sacrificing 
his signature style, in what seems to 
be a new quest for a great American 
film.

The years will probably be good 
to “There Will Be Blood.” Like our 
number two on the list of best films 
of the year, “No Country For Old 
Men,” this sprawling period piece will 
be revisited and studied by future stu-
dents of cinema, general cinephiles, 
and historians interested in what 
America was like today. See it once, 
and you’ll be blown back in your seat. 
See it multiple times, and you start to 
comprehend some core philosophy 
Anderson only begins hinting at. The 
problem with printed reviews is that 
once the ink hits the page, there’s no 
turning back. The initial ideas have 
been set in eternity. But films like 
“Blood” are fluid, always changing to 
the naked eye and remaining relevant 
as our cultures shift. It’s a testament 
to everything that’s great about the 
movies.

sion project fall to pieces at the hands of executive Sigourney 
Weaver’s demographics marketing and commercial tinkering, 
displaying the prime reason why Apatow is the giant he is 
today: words.

10. Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead: The 
premier “actor’s director” Sidney Lumet has been out of 
the limelight for some time but returned this year to prove 
he could still pull a masterstroke like he did in the 1970s 
with “Serpico” and “Dog Day Afternooon.” With Kelly 
Masterson’s tightly tuned screenplay, the old salt spins a 
crime-drama of two brothers (the slimy Philip Seymour 
Hoffman and the dunce Ethan Hawke) who plan to rob 
their parents’ jewelry store. Lumet milks every scene for char-
acter drama in a way that would make a rookie filmmaker 
shrink in his seat. 

9. Into the Wild: Every year you run into films that seem 
to annoyingly plead for awards, like this year’s “Reign Over 
Me” and “American Gangster.” In this category, Sean Penn’s 
“Into the Wild” serves as the dark horse, a film that should 
have ended up a bloated flight of pretension, but was woven 
well enough that we left our cynicism at the door. The dra-
matic retelling of doomed idealist Chris McCandless frames 
him both as glowing martyr and as a young man lacking per-
spective, expertly captured by up-and-comer Emile Hirsch.

8. Alpha Dog: Maybe guys thought that Justin Timberlake 
would challenge their heterosexuality, and maybe girls 
thought Nick Cassevetes’ next film after “The Notebook” 
wouldn’t be as tear-jerky. For whatever reason, the astound-
ingly dramatic “Alpha Dog” never found an audience, and 
now seems destined for a long run on HBO. Sad, since the 
true story of a preventable kid-on-kid murder paints a drug 
and ego-fueled scene of suburban youth most people don’t 
know to acknowledge.

7. Hotel Chevalier: Wes Anderson’s humor may be 
an acquired taste, but it’s getting more and more difficult to 
ignore his highly articulate style; symbolic colors and slow-
motion panoramic tracking shots that permeate his newest 
work. “The Darjeeling Limited” combined visual cues with 
a newfound sense of philosophical drama, but the real trans-

formation for Anderson was the 11-minute short “Hotel 
Chevalier,” a subtle and uncomfortable glimpse at a one-
sided relationship of emotional abuse between Jack (Jason 
Schwartzman) and an unnamed lover (Natalie Portman).

6. I’m Not There: Biopic saturation continues unabated, 
especially in the wake of the “Ray”/“Walk the Line” phenom-
enon. Thankfully, 2007 yielded some of the more bearable 
(“Talk to Me,” “Rescue Dawn”) and innovative ones, like the 
black-and-white Joy Division tale, “Control.” It was Todd 
Haynes who stole the show, though, with his wildly off-the-
cuff, surrealistic dive into the enigma of Bob Dylan. Using 
six actors to portray the persona-shifting star, Haynes’ manic 
adventure is at once a tribute, an expose, a satire and an art 
film.

5. Zodiac: Criticized for being “too long” or “not as cool 
as his earlier stuff,” David Fincher’s crime procedural “Zodiac” 
found a new pace for the man who made the cult smash 
“Fight Club” almost a decade ago. Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark 
Ruffalo play the journalist and cop, respectively, who discover 
themselves as psychological victims of the notorious Bay Area 
murderer, driven by their quest to solve the crime. No other 
film last year handled anxiety and fear as aptly as “Zodiac,” 
Fincher’s coming of age as a director of controlled ambition.

crescendos and murmurs. Honed orchestra 
sweeps and organically toned arrangements 
take the edge off the impending dread detailed 
in Thom Yorke’s lyrics. The paranoid Brits may 
have finally settled down.

3. Deerhoof — Friend Opportunity 
The fearsome Hoof 
trio melds computer 
wizardry with the 
raw power of clas-
sic guitar blasts; 
sometimes on 
Friend Opportunity 
they forgo stringed 
instruments alto-
gether for sum-

moned beat orchestras and sailing synth pads, 
blanketing their experimental backgrounds 
onto the three-minute pop formula. 

Greg Saunier’s spastic jazz-improv drum-
ming is always brilliantly on and off the beat 
simultaneously, and while Satomi Matsuzaki’s 
shrill singing will turn some people off imme-
diately, those who enjoy her chirpy range will 
find much more to love in the group. The 12-
minute suite “Look Away” closes the record, 
originally composed as a film soundtrack 
but now a perfect experimental jab of noise 
to punctuate an otherwise concise series of 
intricate pop baubles. 

4. Battles — Mirrored
Don’t call it math 
rock, call it a space 
jam. Battles man-
age to intertwine 
barbed instru-
ments in complex 
layers without any 
numbing techni-
cal wankery — no 
eight-minute prog 

keyboard solos here, only military precision. 
Thanks to effects pedals, Tyondai Braxton 
can warble like a chorus of gifted chipmunks 
and it doesn’t seem absurd, just unapolo-
getically modern. On standout track “Atlas,” 
sharpened, lightly distorted keys duel over 
rock-steady clacks, building to a catchy, 
charming, and prophetic uproar.

5. No Age — Weirdo Rippers 
Dudes, thanks for 
growing up the punk 
scene. Dean Spunt 
and Randy Randall 
introduce the perks 
of the ambient 
drone world to the 
fuzz-zone of Husker 
Du with an L.A. 
skate-rat mentality. 

It’s like the first time you ate a peanut-butter-
and-Nutella sandwich. Weirdo Rippers alter-
nates between ethereal instrumentals and har-
rowing anthems from a pair of best friends who 
grew up with the Smell, a downtown L.A. club 
staple. As poster children for that scene, they 
are the first to break into greater fandom, and 
deserve props for their tone-deaf yet euphoric 
tinkering. 

6. M.I.A. — Kala
Where else this year 
could you find a 
Bollywood throw-
back, aboriginal 
Australian kid rap-
pers, London grime, 
and gunshot cho-
ruses on one album? 
Maya Arulpragasam 
succeeds wildly with 

third-world beats and politically charged club 
phrases, operating in her own post-everything 
global war zone of culture. She bounces around 
like a spunky kid when addressing contro-
versial subjects like being refused a U.S. visa, 
and celebrates interracial musical commingling. 
Nothing is off limits, and her approach is lib-
erating. 

7. Of Montreal — Hissing Fauna, Are You the 
Destroyer?
“Most Openly 
Depressed Album 
of the Year” goes 
to Kevin Barnes’ 
opus Hissing 
Fauna, a record 
dressed in disco 
glitz that wants to 
lose it on the dance 

floor, but has personal issues to deal with 
first. Insect synths and a pristine produc-
tion contrast with Barnes’ lyrical catharsis, 
tackling subjects like antidepressants, lost 
love and a desire for the divine marred 
by logic. It culminates with the 12-min-
ute stream-of-consciousness “The Past is a 
Grotesque Animal,” where Barnes’ psyche 
and the listener reach a voyeuristic intimacy.  

8. Animal Collective — Strawberry Jam
Prepare to be 
psyched — the 
Collective has 
returned with 
far-flung sample 
constructions and 
newfound vocal 
bite. In contrast 
to the group’s pre-
vious work, Jam 

shines like a precious metal, with each ele-
ment popping out of the mix in Technicolor. 
Noah Lennox further proves his wholehearted 
songwriting chops with the strongest tracks 
on the record; “Chores” revisits bouncy tribal 
ground and “Derek” bookends the album 
with a sweetly shifting ode to a canine. 

9. Sunset Rubdown — Random Spirit Lover
The “Dense but 
Rewarding” award 
is left for Spencer 
Krug’s (also of Wolf 
Parade) other out-
fit, where the song-
smith has free reign 
to prance around 
like a Renaissance 
fair balladeer. Very 

few moments on the album allow for breath-
ing room, as the foursome tend to pack as 
many yodels, keyboard flourishes and tuneful 
guitar exercises in a single song as possible 
just before they reach freak overkill. After 
listening to so much mythical indie, you may 
want to go live near a great kingdom and fight 
wicked beasts yourself.

10. Jens Lekman — Night Falls Over Kortedala
Jens, don’t be sad. 
You came out with 
one of the year’s 
snappiest indie-pop 
collections, filled 
with witty quips 
and pillaged snip-
pets from old vinyl. 
From the hilarious 
lesbian cover-up “A 

Postcard to Nina” to the soulfully awkward 
crush in “Kanske Ar Jag I Dig,” Jens managed 
to mix the right amount of wry sweetness 
with a palette of finely aged samples. Sweden 
ought to be proud.

Up Next: If The-Dream can make the 
“-ella, -eh, -eh” of “Umbrella” somehow 
charming, he works more miracles than 
Moses. Expect another miraculous say-
ing in the coming year, considering he 
has penned ditties for every artist from 
Rihanna to Mary J. Blige.

3.  R&B Royalty — The-Dream vs. 
Ne-Yo vs. T-Pain vs. Chris Brown

If 2006 saw the musical rise of the 
South, 2007 is claimed by a new-age, 
four-way court of R&B royalty. But 
this set of crooners has seen major 
problems this year, from T-Pain mak-
ing off-color comments about Ray-J’s 
penis to The-Dream starting a spat 
with Chris Brown to Ne-Yo suing 
music’s most prominent pisser R. 
Kelly for ousting him from a tour.

But away from the scandals, all 
four have gifted R&B with some ripe 
talent: Ne-Yo and Rihanna formed 
one of the year’s most electric boy-girl 
pairings with “Hate That I Love You,” 
Chris Brown’s “Exclusive” showed 
sexy-fied maturity and The-Dream’s 
writing credits were as ubiquitous 
as T-Pain’s guest spots. But toward 
2007’s end, it was only by the grace 
of Chris Brown and T-Pain that the 
year’s hottest dance track was born: 
“Kiss Kiss.” It has permeated airwaves 
with swift abandon, proving that even 
the self-proclaimed “nappy boy” and 
“pretty boy” can dig out a pleasurable 
hit from a string of keyboard notes. 
Verdict: Chris Brown & T-Pain, for 
partnering to make the ridiculously 
danceable “Kiss Kiss.”
Up Next: Usher comes to reclaim his 
rightful crown as king of R&B with a 
March album release.

4. The Assassination of Jesse 
James by the Coward Robert 
Ford: The resurrection of the Western 
movie was one of the true novelty acts 
of 2007, with shoot-‘em-up “3:10 to 
Yuma” and beautifully subdued “The 
Assassination of Jesse James by the 
Coward Robert Ford.” If that title was 
a wallop to your eyes, so is just about 
everything else — from the sweep-
ing landscapes to the childlike gaze of 
Casey Affleck’s Robert Ford looking at 
notorious Jesse James (Brad Pitt) with 
wide-eyed fanaticism. It’s a somber dis-
section of American mythology, and 
reminiscent of the closing line from 
the classic western “The Man Who 
Shot Liberty Valance”: “When legend 
becomes fact, print the legend.”

3. This is England: There’s no way 
to describe just how “This is England” 
sneaks up on you. It’s a film so oddly 
heartfelt that you can’t ignore Shane 
Meadows’ most personal project. 
Taking place in early 1980s England, 
the melodrama follows the friendship 
between young Shaun and a group of 
older skinheads. When the militant, 
racist Combo arrives to take the reigns, 
he sends the impressionable boy 
into uncharted territory. Navigating 
somewhere between an indictment 
of Margaret Thatcher’s Britain and 
Francois Truffaut’s “The 400 Blows,” 
“This is England” leaves you stirred 
even through the credits.

2. No Country For Old Men: To even 
try to recap the sheer breadth of this 
film in a paragraph would undermine 
everything the Coen brothers orches-
trated. Josh Brolin is the man without 
an escape plan, Tommy Lee Jones is the 
witness to great evil and Javier Bardem 
is the angel of death that links everyone 
together. “No Country For Old Men” is 
perhaps the most critically acclaimed 
film of the year, and for good reason; 
it speaks numbers about the ambiv-
alent, apocalyptic culture we live in.

Andy Islip, freshman Brandon Maryatt 
and senior Evan Hsiao finished second 
in 2:09.76, falling behind Air Force by 
only .09 seconds.

The women’s swim team lost a 
close duel with conference rival Loyola 
Marymount University on Jan. 5. 
Although both teams won seven events 
each and the Tritons came away with 
both relay wins, the Lions snuck past 
UCSD with a three-point win in the 
overall competition.

“It was a tough loss against LMU 
because they are our conference rivals,” 
junior Aubrey Panis said. “We worked 
through it, and hopefully we will be 
able to build off this meet to improve in 
future meets.” 

Despite the loss, there were some 
outstanding individual and relay per-
formances. The Tritons started the 
meet by winning the 400 medley relay 
with Panis, junior Kendall Bohn, junior 
Jennifer Sims and junior Erinn Deters 
in a time of 4:02.06. Sims also won the 

200 butterfly in a time of 2:08.02 and 
the 100 butterfly with a time of 58.84. 
Freshman Anju Shimura won both of 
her events as well, taking the 100 back-
stroke in a time of 1:00.07 and winning 

the 200 backstroke in 2:10.83. 
The final event was the 400 freestyle 

relay, and the Tritons swam a relay 
team that consisted of junior Shannon 
Simonds, senior Lauren Forbes, Panis 

and Shimura. Going into the last leg 
of the relay, LMU had nearly a 1.5-sec-
ond lead over the Tritons, but Shimura 
swam a speedy 52.55 in her leg of the 
100 freestyle, catching the competition 
and bringing the Tritons the 400 free-
style relay title. 

“We swam well considering we 
haven’t had a meet in two months,” 
Sims said. “Anju catching up and win-
ning the last relay was motivational 
and inspiring. We are ready for our 
next meet.”

With some excellent individual 
and team performances these past few 
weeks, the Tritons are ready to com-
pete again and improve on their previ-
ous meets. With only a few meets left 
before the conference and then national 
championships, they will be looking to 
improve on their times and dives and 
qualify as many athletes as possible.

facing Stanford,” coach Runyan said. 
“They are a strong school, but we match 
up well against them and can take them 
if we are fencing sharp.” 

After the competition in Colorado 
Springs, the Tritons will look to their 
meets at the North American Cup in 
Atlanta on Jan. 18 and the Northwestern 
tournament in Chicago on Feb. 2 in 
order to start qualifying their fencers

THURSDAY, JANUARY 10, 2008

By Casey Armstrong
Contributing Writer

SWIM & DIVE — UCSD had a busy 
winter break in the water, first traveling 
to Las Vegas to compete in the UNLV 
Winter Invitational on Dec. 15 and 16. 
Next, the swim and dive teams split up 
as the men’s team returned home to 
face the Air Force Academy 4 and the 
women’s team took to the road again to 
take on Loyola Marymount University. 
All teams struggled in their separate 
competitions, but there were some out-
standing individual performances that 
proved that the Tritons are ready to fin-
ish strong before the NCAA Division II 
Championships begin on Mar. 12.

At the UNLV diving meet, senior 
Andrew Skewes notched a fourth-place 
finish in three-meter diving and an 
eighth-place finish in one-meter div-
ing. The men had the most success as 
a team in the three-meter diving event, 
as Skewes was followed by sophomore 
Kevin Sullivan in eighth, senior Jeff 
Bryant in 17th and senior Aaron Cantu 
in 19th place. In the one-meter event, 
Bryant finished 13th and was closely 
followed by Sullivan and Cantu, who 
finished in 15th and 16th, respectively.

The women’s diving team had suc-
cess as well in the one-meter diving 
competition, with senior Nicole Stasio 

finishing 11th, followed by sophomore 
Jennifer Lappe in 14th and senior 
Amanda Mason in 18th. 

With winter break’s meets in the 
books, team is now focusing on qualify-
ing for postseason competition.

“We had a decent showing at Las 
Vegas, but after a long week of finals, 
we did as well as could be expected,” 
Bryant said. “Now that we’re coming up 
on the end of the season, we’re trying 
to qualify as many divers for nationals 
as we can.”

The men’s swim team hosted a relay 
meet against the Air Force Academy on 
Jan. 4 but fell by a final score of 37-76, 
managing to win just one event out of 
seven against the formidable Falcons. 
The lopsided score may have been par-
tially due to the fact that the Falcons 
fielded several relay teams, while the 
Tritons only swam a single team for a 
majority of the events. 

The relay meet featured a variety 
of uncommon swimming races, such 
as three-person 225 stroke relays and 
a six-person 150 freestyle relay. The 
Tritons won the 225-meter backstroke 
relay with a team of junior Adam Jones, 
junior Steven Hardy and sophomore 
Scott McCoid in 1:57.28. The 225-
meter breaststroke relay of sophomore

FENCING — As the final warm-up 
before starting the official NCAA com-
petition, UCSD fencers hosted their 
annual Bladerunner meet on Jan. 5 and  
6. Unlike most meets, Bladerunner was 
not a team contest but instead an open 
competition, where fencers represented 
themselves and their scores counted 
only toward their personal finish. This 
style allowed for UCSD to face off 
against other fencers that they would 
not normally see in intercollegiate play, 
providing preparation for the NCAA 
West Invitational coming up on Jan. 
12-13 in Colorado Springs, Colo. 

Head coach Heidi Runyan said she 
thought that the unique challenges in 
the open competition created a more 
unique aspect to the meet.

“Many of the opponents have more 
experience than the average collegiate 
fencer and there are direct elimination 
bouts that go to 15 touches, instead of 
the usual five,” Runyan said. “Fencing 
smart and being in good condition are 
even more important to success.”

Sophomore Sean Blum, who fin-
ished sixth in epee, welcomed the new 
format and said that it would challenge 

him and his teammates while allowing 
them to fence without worrying about 
the team’s overall performance.

“Because Bladerunner was an open 
event, it drew tougher opponents than 
we have had to fence in the SoCal 
intercollegiate conference, especially 
in men’s and women’s epee,” Blum 
said. “We have to fence a lot of strang-
ers, which brings some nervousness, es-
pecially when the strangers are world-
class fencers from Europe like Benoit 
Bouysset and Andrea Rentmeister.”

The fencers that Blum alluded to are 
two of the fencing world’s top names, 
with Bouysset hailing from France and 
Rentmeister from Austria. Having this 
added level of elite competition helped 
stoke a fun but aggressive atmosphere 
at the meet, according to some of the 
participants.

Senior Emily Lipoma took first 
place in women’s foil out of 20 fenc-
ers, most of which were highly rated 
as either B- or C-tier fencers. In men’s 
saber, freshman Zach Jones notched a 
fantastic rookie performance with his 
first-place finish, with fellow Triton 
sophomore Bryan Kim taking third. 

The NCAA West Invitational in 
Colorado this weekend will be the 
first serious road trip of the season for 
UCSD, and will be a good transition 
from local meets to the competition 
that the Tritons will eventually be see-
ing at the National Championships in 
Columbus, Ohio, in March.

“Traveling will certainly be a 
change,” Lipoma said. “The competi-
tion that we will face when we travel [to 

Colorado] will be much stronger than 
the competition we see in our Southern 
California conference. However, we will 
be traveling with a fairly seasoned team 
and traveling shouldn’t pose too much 
of a problem.”

Sophomore saberist Anne 
Marie Schnecker, whose only loss at 
Bladerunner was to the eventual tour-
nament champion, also said that the 

road trip will not hinder the team’s 
growing momentum and success.

“With fencing, there is not really 
all that much advantage to fencing at 
home as opposed to fencing away, so 
I don’t think that Colorado will be too 
much of a challenge for us,” Schnecker 
said. “I heard ... that it is pretty hard to 
breathe there because of the high eleva-
tion, so I think that could be the only 

difference. Besides that, I really think 
that we’ll do well at the meet.”

Runyan is looking forward to fac-
ing off against some of the toughest 
schools in the country, a chance that is 
not often presented to her team in the 
Southern California Conference.

M. VOLLEYBALL — The Tritons 
took care of business in their season 
opener on Jan. 5 against UC Santa 
Cruz, winning in four close games, 
28-30, 30-28, 30-24, 30-26. Three 
players finished with double-digit 
kills, and the team improved after 
each successive game.

“For the first game and a half we 
played tight,” head coach Kevin Ring 
said. “We were disappointed with how 
we started but we kept our composure 
and the guys off the bench really 
boosted our play.”

Sophomore outside hitter Jason 
Spangler led the offensive attack 
against the Banana Slugs, recording 
a double-double with 22 kills and 
15 digs. 

Feeding Spangler and the other 
hitters were freshman Phil Bannan, 
who recorded 37 assists, and sopho-
more Billy Arnold, who added 20. 
After the two spent the fall practice 
season competing for the starting 
position, Arnold got the nod against 
the Banana Slugs and Bannan came 
in off the bench. 

Ring and his staff record statis-
tics at every practice and made their 
decision based on those numbers. 
But nothing is definite early in the 
season, as Bannan entered during the 
second game and outperformed his 
counterpart.

“Billy had the better overall num-
bers, and that’s why he started,” Ring 
said. “It wasn’t that he was perform-
ing poorly — our team was. But we 
didn’t want to go down 2-0, and so we 
made the change to Phil. He started 
connecting with our middles, and we 
pulled out game two.” 

UCSD appeared a little jittery in 
the season’s first home game, fall-
ing behind 16-9 in game one. But 
the teams rallied and pulled within 
two points after an ace from sopho-
more opposite Frank Fritsch. Kills by 
Fritsch and freshman middle blocker 
Tyler Kern brought the Tritons with-

in one, but they couldn’t finish the 
comeback, and the Banana Slugs took 
game one. 

In game two, momentum contin-
ued in favor of the Banana Slugs, who 
built a 21-16 lead. But the Tritons 
used a 6-1 run to tie the game at 
22. Spangler and Fritsch continued 
UCSD’s tear, sending down kills to 
give the Tritons the 30-28 win.

Despite struggling early, Ring was 
pleased with the team’s passing and 
transition.

“We played poorly in that first 
game and started poorly in the sec-
ond,” he said. “The subs elevated our 
game when we needed it and our 
passing and transition games were 
excellent. We didn’t hit the panic but-
ton and started playing well.”

The Tritons jumped out to a 22-17 
lead in game three and closed the deal 
30-24 after senior outside hitter Russ 
Hardy put down the final kill. 

Missing from the initial roster, 
Hardy rejoined the team after being 
absent for fall practices.

According to Ring, Hardy is a 
returning starter from two years 
ago, because he studied abroad last 
year. Regardless of the hiatus, Ring 
was impressed with how well Hardy 
served and passed.

“He came in and made a differ-
ence,” Ring said. “We’re still trying 
to get his jumping legs back, but he 
played well for not competing at this 
level for awhile.”

The fourth game was hotly con-
tested, and saw nine ties before the 
Tritons were able to pull away. Tied 
for the final at 22, UCSD scored five of 
the next six points to take a comfort-
able lead at 27-23. Spangler finished 
his impressive night with a game- and 
match-clinching kill to give UCSD 
the season-opening victory.

With the win under their belt, the 
Tritons now turn their attention to 
No. 1 Brigham Young University  on 
Jan. 11 and 12. Ring knows that the 
team will need to improve its play to 
compete against the best team in the 
nation.

“It’s really a night and day differ-
ence from UCSC,” he said. “BYU is 
more athletic and taller but we can be 
competitive if we serve tough and get 
bigger at the net. We have to find a 
balance of aggressive and smart.”

The team will focus on establish-
ing its presence at the net against the 
Cougars and try to force mistakes. 
Ring said he will look to get Fritsch 
and Spangler more involved in the 
offense as well as keep a balance of 
running the middles in transition.
