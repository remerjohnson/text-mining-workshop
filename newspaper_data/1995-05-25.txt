BERKELEY - Former UCB

received a posthumous degree 
in English, nearly 70 years 
after his expulsion from the 
university. Russell was 
expelled in 1926, two weeks 
before .. he end of his senior 
year, on charges ran&ing from 
blasphemy to Bolshevism. His 
plight attracted the attention of 
the ACLU, journalist Upton 
Sinclair and, last year, his

While Russell died in 1972, 
his granddaughter, with the

Unfair Dismissal 
SAN DIEGO - Lucinda 
Callender, a SDSU political

that personal conflict with the 
chairman of her department 
led to her termination. 
Callender was notified last 
May that her contract would 
not be renewed because she 
did not meet SDSU's stan-
dards for "professional 
growth," despite a letter she 
received from her 
department's personnel 
committee which cited her 
outstanding teaching record. 
According to Callender, 
Political Science Department 
Chairman Louis Terrell filed 
complaints against her with 
SDSU Academic Affairs, 
claiming she behaved in a 
hostile manner toward him

President Thomas Day 
decided against renewing her

17 Quit Grove In Labor Dispute 
EMPLOYMENT: $15,000 
debt prompts institution of 
unpopular work rules 
By Francisco DeVrie. 
Senior Staff Writer 

Seventeen Grove Caffe employees have 
resignedjn protest during the last two weeks 
in a bitter dispute with the UCSD adminis-
tration and the Grove Caffe Committee 
over the suspension of employee perks and 
the implementation of stringent work rules. 

"I f I am to run the Caffe, I will not 
tolerate being treated like a child.,.," wrote 
Assistant Manager Peter Kaplan in his res-
ignation letter to the Grove Caffe Commit-

tee, which oversees all Caffe operations. "I 
care a lot for my co-workers, yet I will not 
participate in a system which reduces them 
to slaves." 

The changes, which were initiated to 
compensate for a $15,000 debt that the 
Grove has accumulated this year, included 
a large cut -back in staffi ng, a strict policy of 
not paying employees for a shift if they 
neglect to clock in"or out, and the elimina-
tion of all employee snacks and meals. 

The Caffe, which is owned jointly by the 
Associated Students and the Craft Center, 
is projected to have a net revenue of over 
$560,000 in the 1994-95 fiscal year. 

Administrators say the changes were

BOMBS AWAY RIMAC Contractor 
Demands More Pay 

" 

NEGOTIADON: University officials meet 
to discuss over $2 million in claims 
By Marianne Viell 
Associate News Editor 

Tbough RIMAC has been 
complete for almost six 
months, legal hassles continue 
to plague the troubled $32 mil-
lion athletic facility. The con-
tractor is now claiming that 
the university owes it over $2 
million in additional compen-
sation. 

Plagued by rain, schedule 
delays and soil errosion be-
neath the building, RIMAC 
was completed nearly a year 
late and several million dol-
lars over budget. In addition to 
approximately $2 million dol-
lars which Moran Construc-
tion, the head contractor of the 
project, claims was accrued in 
going over schedule, it is also 
claiming that the university 
should pay $488,000 for re-
pairs to counteract the "soil 
subsidence" under several por-
tions of RIMAe. 

currently negotiating Moran's 
claim. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Facilities Design and Con-
struction (FD&C) Boone 
Hellman said he believes the 
two parties will come to a reso-
lution within the next six to 
eight weeks and that there will 
be no litigation. "I'm desper-
ately trying to keep this away 
from the attorneys," he said. 
"Attorneys aren't trained to 
solve anything." 

Though Hellman could not 
say where the funds for a settle-
ment would come from, Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Tom Tucker stated in memo to 
Hellman, "I once again want 
to emphasize that Student Af-
fairs should not be expected to 
provide any funding for costs 
associated with the claims."

A.S. Debates Reducing UCSAFunding by 50 Percent Next Year 
RNANCE: Roll call 
vote will decide issue 
by Friday 
By Nina BouIhton 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Finance Committee 
voted yesterday to reduce UCSD's 
contribution to the University of 
California Student Association, 
though the final decision awaits the 
results of an open roll-call vote by 
the A.S. Council to be concluded 

Friday. 
The Finance Committee origi-

nally recommended the council fund 
UCSA by 75 cents per student per 
year, rather than the current rate of 
$1.50 per student per year. This 
would have amounted to $10,350 
for UCSA funding, based on an es-
timated student population of 13,800 
- a 50-percent reduction from the 
current level. 

After a heated three-hour debate, 
the council moved to put a $1 per 
student per year funding allocation, 

which amounts to a $13,800 contri-
bution, to the two-day roll-call vote. 

Intra-Fraternity Council Presi-
dent Greg Hearn said that UCSA's 
funding needed to be reduced be-
cause it was draining a large percent 
of the A.S. budget, which he said 
should be going toward student or-
ganizations. UCSA funding, how-
ever, is currently less than four per-
cent of the A.S. 's student activity-
fee revenue. 

"We have been donating far more 
acc:ording to the percentage of our 

budget. 
Other A.S. Council members 

questioned the effectiveness of 
UCSA representation. "The ques-
tion is, in [light] of Smith v. Regents, 
[is UCSA] warranting full funding 
or is it time to reconsider," said 
Student Advocate Souley Diallo. 

Some members suggested that 
UCSA funding was being cut to 
provide more money for concerts 
and events. "You have [$146,000] 
going to programming. You can af-

necessary to make up for poor man-
agement practices that have left the 
Caffe mired in red ink. 

"Any coffee shop that is [$15,000 
in debt] is not being well man-
aged ... ," said Assistant Vice Chan-
cellor of Student Programs and Fa-
cilities Tom Tucker. "Management, 
[both] staff and students, has obvi-
ously failed." 

Tucker, who said the Grove's 
fiscal insolvency was the fault of all 
levels of administration, including 
himself, the Grove Committee and 
the student managers, recommended 
most of the unpopular policy changes 
that were implemented by the com-
mittee. 

Craft Center Director Ron 
Carlson, who sits on the Caffe Com-
mittee, agreed that Grove manage-
ment had failed. "[Tucker] saw that 
the committee had kind of tripped 
and fallen on its 

Beyond the question of the fair-
ness of the actual change&, how-
ever, many studenta have been ex-
tremely critical of the manner in 
which the policy changes were 
made. 

"(The decision-malting process] 
is different, because we've never 
been in this situation before," 
Carlson said. "The Caffe's always 
been financially solvent." 

In a letter delivered to Tucker 
yesterday, A.S. President Naomi 
Falk wrote that she was concerned 
about the lack of student input in the 
decision-malting process. 

Paul Eykamp, a UCSD graduate 
student and the student representa-
tive from the Craft Center on the 
Caffe Committee, said yesterday 
that the changes were pushed 
through the committee at the only 
meeting this year that he has missed. 

"I was neither informed before 
nor after [the missed meeting] ofthe 
full set of specific changes alleg-

edly agreed to at 
face ... ," he said. 
"The changes, 1 
think, are very 
constructive. " 

Kaplan, how-
ever, said that 
while "there may 
have been some 
bad management 
decisions" on the 
part of the stu-
dent managers,

Tom Tucker present at the 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of meeting was 

Student Programs and FacilitieS A.S. Commis-
Committee. 

"You could pretty much ask any 
employee in the place and they'd 
support the [student managers]," he 
said. 

While some of the resignations, 
which account for a third of the 
current workforce and a majority of 
the management staff, were from 
employees who planned to leave 
anyway, many were the result of the 
policy cbanges. 

In a memo to the Caffe Commit-
tee, Acting Student Manager of the 
Grove Sunday Gover, who is not 
resigning, wrote that the resigna-
tions should not be taken lightly. 
"Clearly, staying in a job that has 
been such an investment for [the 
student employees] is in their best 
interest...," she wrote. "They can-
not work for an absentee, ill-in-
formed and reactionary set of ob-
servers and administrators." 

All 17 of those resigning sent 
official letters of resignation, many 
of which were extremely critical of 
the Caffe Committee. 

Carlson said that he felt "sad-
dened that [the students] didn't take 
the time to come in and talk to me." 

"I thought it was kind of selfish 
on their part ... ," he added. "We are 
all making sacrifices." 

In an interview on Tuesday, 
Gover said that she "would have 
hoped that the letters would have 
struck a human chord with the ad-

sioner of Opera-
tions and Services Jean Lee, who 
was attending her first Caffe meet-
ing since taking offICe earlier this 
month. 

Lee said she plans to meet with 
Grove employees to help foster a 
better relationship. 

To improve communication as 
well as to increase A.S. presence on 
the Caffe Committee, Falk has pro-
posed the addition of the A.S. vice 
president of finance and the A.S. 
financial controller as voting mem-
bers of the committee. Both Carlson 
and Tucker said they support the 
proposal, which must now be heard 
by the A.S. Council. 

Grove employees have also sug-
gesteel that the Grove manager be 
made a voting member of the com-
mittee to foster better communica-
tion. However, the official agree-
ment for the Grove specifically pro-
hibits such an arrangement. 

Lee said the committee hopes 
that some of the austerity measures 
instituted, in particular the suspen-
sion of employee snacks, can be 
lifted once the financial picture 
brightens. 

But Gover said the biggest prob-
lem employees have with the policy 
changes is that they were made with-
out real-world knowledge of Caffe 
operations. "I think the administra-
tion is still looking at numbers, 
solely .. . ," she said. "I believe the

Bomb Scare Forces 
Library Evacuation 
ALERT: Suspicious 
package discovered to 
be a .nylon jacket 
By Terry Lew 
Staff Writer 

The University Library was 
evacuated yesterday afternoon after 
a researcher discovered a suspicious-
looking bundle and alerted librar-
ians. 

Lyn Sanny, a UC Davis and UC 
San Francisco alumnus, was work-
ing in the west wing of the second 
floor of the library at about 5 p.m. 
when he spotted the bundle. 

"It seemed suspicious, so I 
brought it to the attention of the 
librarian," said Sanny. 

Sanny added that the green 
bundle looked like "a nylon rain 
breaker wrapped around the mouth 
of a container." 

Librarians phoned the UCSD po-
lice, who sent an officer to investi-
gate. The officer agreed it looked 

strange and the called Metro Ar-
son Strike Team ~M.A.S.T.). 

Members of MAS.T. arrived 
at 6:25 p.m., X-rayed the bundle, 
and determined that it was "a false 
alarm - a wrapped up tarp kind of 
thing." 

"I believe it was something that 
had been taped and folded up to 
resemble a package, but it was 
actually some sort of cloth-type 
material," said Luis Santaella of 
the UCSD Police Department. 

After determining that the 
bundle was harmless and It:aving it 
with the UCSD police, MAS.T. 
left for another call at San Diego 
City College. The library was re-
opened at about 6:45 p.m. 

Twoothersuspicious packages, 
both false alarms, have been dis-
covered at UCSD in the last two 
months. One was found at 
Sverdrop Hall at the Scripps Insti-
tution of Oceanography on April 
12 and another at Bonner Hall on 
March 15.

ford UCSA if you want to. It's a 
matter of priorities," said Gradu-
ate Student Association Vice Presi-
dent External Steve Dubb. 

Other A.S. members supported 
tbe UCSA's role in state and na-
tional lobbying. 

According to Warren student 
Poncho Guevara, "In the 19805 
UCSA was one of the top-five 
lobbying groups in the [st8te] 
Capital. If you want to look at 
what you could do to best help our 
campus... supporting UCSA is 
critical. " 

UCSA Executive Director 
Glenn Magpantay said that a cut 
in funding would mean a dra-
matic reduction in the UCSA's 
staff. 

If the vote passes with a major-
ity, then the S 1 per student allow-
ance will stand. If the vote fails, 
the item will no longer be on the 
budget and, according to Vice 
President Administrative Jennifer 
Nicoll, the issue will ~ reconsid-
ered next week, which could either 
lead to funding cuts or a return to 
the status quo.

u.s. Embassy In Jerusalem 
Would Ignite Violence 

House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob 
Dole have introduced similar bills which would move the American 
Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, if the U.S. 
government is not willing to recognize Palestine, then it has no 
business pulling one of its embassies in what is at least a partially 
Palestinian area. In addition, such an action would be hypocritical: 
The United States is gung-ho about being the middle-man in the 
peace process, and yet has a bias toward Israel. 

Considering that the United States has not even recognized 
Palestine as a nation, as well the fact that the ambassador would 
serve Israel and not Palestine, it is clear that this change of venue 
would cause more problems than it would solve. 

If Gingrich and Dole are set upon placing the U.S. embassy in 
both a Palestinian and an Israeli area, then they should introduce 
a different bill which would create a separate U.S. embassy in the 
recently established Palestinian territory - away from Jerusalem. 
By placing separate embassies in each of these two countries, the 
United ~ tates - as a major political force and as a peacemaking 
factor be 'ween Israel and the still-unrecognized Palestine-
would be treating both Israel and Palestine equally. However, 
unless the United States recognizes Palestine as a country 
beforehand, the embassy should remain in Tel Aviv, which is 
clearly an Israeli area. 

Otherwise, the dramatic change in location would only give 
Palestinians more reason for bitterness toward both Israel and the 
United States. And this would solve nothing - it would only 
create more violence in the already-unstable Middle East. 

Young's Diplomacy Should 
Be a Model for Regents 

UCLA Chancellor Charles Young should be commended for 
his efforts to calm escalating tension at the regents ' hearing on 
affirmative action last Thursday in San Francisco. The regents, 
who abruptly walked out during the meeting because of some 
students' disruptive behavior, could learn something from 
Young's diplomacy. While the outbreak was certainly disrespect-
ful, simply cutting off dialogue on such an emotional and critical 
issue only serves to further alienate students and the public. 

Young, who is the UC's most vocal proponent of affirmative 
action, told the students that while he supports their struggle, he 
thought the disruption was counterproductive. "This is a matter to 
be dealt with rationally, it's not a matter to be dealt with by 
chants and slogans ... We need to get off this scapegoating and 
get onto discussion of the facts," he said. 

Young added that he would do everything in his power to push the 
board to set up a affirmative-action forum, in which students, staff and 
faculty would not only have the opportunity to address the board but 
also debate the issue and exchange ideas. At its meetings, the board 
currently grants the public an entire three minutes to express its views. 

Ultimately, it was Young's willingness to simply speak witb 
the students - and perhaps more importantly,listen to them-
that put an end to the conflict and prompted the reopening of the 
meeting. But sadly, Young was only one of handful of UC 
officials - including student Regent Terry Wooten, student 
Regent-designate Edward Gomez and UC Provost Walter Massey 
- who did not flee the meeting hall. Such complacency does not 
speak well of our university, and in the end, does a grave disser-
vice not only to students, but 10 the people of California. 

Thumbs Up to the 
UC Regents ••• 

... who, despite dubious decisions to raise studenl fees and reevaluate 
affirmative action, showed last week they could make a move 10 
positively impact students' lives. The regents employed good 
judgment when they chose Lalce Yosemite as the site for the next 
UC campus, especially since the growing number of Central 
Californil students do not have a UC school in their area. Some mly 
argue that tbe Merced County site is out in the boondocks, but this 
choice is beneficial since Central Valley high school sludents are SO 
percent less likely to attend a UC than their Northern and Southern 
Californil peers. In addition, I San Joaquin site is I welcome 
alternative to the current urban locations of aD UC campllCl

COMMENTARY: UCSD's mysterious bureaucracy baffles student 
'employees, who must often wade through the system to find a paycheck 

Evidently, I was a very bad 
'person in a past life, because 
karmic forces have chosen to 
take their revenge upon me by 
causing delays in getting my UC 
paychecks. Anyone who has ex-

men!. Now, in San Diego as UC employees, they sit in 
this processing office, leaning back in their chairs as 
they guffaw at Oprah, glancing curiously at piles of 
paperwork and occasionally wondering if they should 
look up "URGENT! THIRD NOTICE!" in their pocket 
English-Russian dictionaries. Seeing an cnvelope

perienced such

feel a cold 
shudder at this 
statement. De-
spite working 
quite diligently, 
I saw the first of 

Jaundiced I the month draw 
near, then pass, 
with nary a 

paycheck in sight. Rent and a stack of 
bills glired at me. 

So began an epic journey. My path, 
like in those Indiana Jones movies, 
should have been traced with dotted 
lines across the campus map: from the 
literature department to International 
RelltionslPacific Studies (I RIPS), 
from communications to Associated 
Students and finally to Payroll, the 
mother ship. During my lravels, the 
Ihought of my landlord's chilly stare 
quickened my slep.

schedule 
canceled and 

marked "ATTN: PAYROLL," they ' ll 
shrug, toss it into a pile of mail headed 
to the music department, then resume 
their discussion about Kato Kaelin. 

I'm quite certain such a secret cen-
ter exists because I didn't succeed in 
disentangling the snarl of red tape un-
til I volunteered 10 personally deliver 
my paperwork to the Payroll Office. I 
highly recommend doing this yourself 
because it bypasses the mysterious pro-
cessing center, where your forms will 
vanish forever into a bureaucratic 
abyss. 

The other reason I am sure of the 
existence of the mysterious office is 
that all of the people whom I dealt with 
during my search knew exactly what 
they were doing, were very helpful and 
had no idea what could be causing the 
delay. 

For those cynical students, let me 
tell you, we've got it made here. Try 
UC Berkeley. You don't know Ihe 
meaning of the word "bureaucracy" 
until you lose a paycheck up there and 
are forced to journey from window to 
window, from one line to another, wilt-
ing under sullen stares behind the glass 
partitions which divide the approxi-
mately four clerks from 3O,OOO-plus 
students. 

As bad as it is, at least bureaucracy 
is a friendlier experience at UCSD -
nol that you get your check any faster. 

As I hunted for my paycheck, I dis-
covered the intricacies of the UCSD 
bureaucracy. The graduate coordina-
tors who were helping me seemed to 
be quite on the ball and were very 
obliging. They would briskly shuffle 
together all my paperwork - pink 
copy here, yellow copy there - then 
bundle it together in a campus-mail 
envelope to be sent to Payroll. Unfor-
tunately, the paperwork was never to 
be seen again.

My paycheck walkabout has led me 
to wonder what would happen if I decided to treat the 
university similarly when lowe it money. There seems 
to be a double standard of epic proportions here. If I 
owe the UC money, the university jumps on me with 
threats of late fees, public stonings Ind appropriations

workers. 'These were the workers who were 50 inept al

Thursday, May 2S, 1995 The UCSD Guardian OPINION S 

DUESBERG HAS PLENTY OF COVERAGE, JUST LoOK FOR IT 
Editor: 

I picked up a ~opy of the Guard-
ian and read Tedd Ladd's commen-
taryon Peter Duesberg ~s recent lec-
ture ("An III-Fated Quest," May 
IS). Evidently, no scientists were at 
the lecture to refute Duesberg's 
claims. 

In aprevious issue of the Guard-
ian, the editorial board made mis-
leading statements ("Duesberg's 
'Crack-Pot' Ideas Cannot Be Ig-
nored," May 4), claiming that the 
scientific community has addressed 
Duesberg's claims in "obscure sci-
entific journals and low-profile sci-
entific forums ... " and that "the press 
has said little about Duesberg's ... 
hypothesis. " 

However, in Discover magazine, 
there's an article ("Of Myths and 
Mischief," Dec. 1994) which ex-
poses all the current AIDS myths, 
including Duesberg's theories. In 
the May, 1995 issue, "The Race 
Against AIDS" explains some of 
the latest results in AI DS research, 
including what accounts for the la-
tency period and what happens to 
the immune system during that 
time. 

Discover is hardly an obscure 
journal, and I've seen parallel cov-
erage in The San Diego Union-Tri-
bune and Newsweek. 

One thing I noticed while in 
school at UC Santa Barbara was 
Ihat most of my classmates - es-
pecially the young ones - are in-
credibly uninformed about current 
events. 

Read a major paper, go trolling 
through a magazine rack. Read 

widely, so that you can sort through 
the noise out there. 

But don't say the coverage isn't 
there just because you haven't seen 
it.

The loogyMan 
Editor: 

Okay, I'm going to take a 
guess - "Peter Chang" is not 
real. He's like Ed Wagner, the cre-
ation of some petty juvenile sense 
of humor who finds it amusing to 
peddle intolerance just to see 
what kind of a reaction it re-
ceives. 

For the sake of argument, 
though, let's pretend Chang is ac-
tually real. We don't necessarily 
have to go so far as to assume Ihat 
he has substance. 

So, "Chang," tell me - do you 
sleep at nighl with the light on, just 
in case some imaginary monster 
like socialism or ethnic sludies 
crawls out from under your bed and 
tries to eat you? (As opposed to 
something real, like capitalism or 
sociobiology, whieh would jump up 
onto the bed, lick your face and curl 
up at your toes.) 

If only it were that simple -
nothing more than some infantile 
formation which might be overcome 
with a little therapy. 

Unfortunately, I think "Ching" 
is actually afraid that other stu-
dents might nol be able to think 
for themselves. He also seems to 
have little regard for their feeble

Some of us purveyors of politi-

cal correctness have act~ally read 
Adam Smith, Sun Tzu, the occa-
sional Wall Street Journal and, if 
only for a giggle, Ayn Rand. How 
is it that we didn't arrive at the same 
conclusions "Chang" did ("Diving 
Head-First Into A Real Education," 
May 18)? Probably because you 
weren't there to set us straight -
we've been infected with ideas. 
Oooh, scary.

Let C ...... Spout His 
Narrow-Minded Views 
Editor: 

I respect the honesty and frank-
ness which Peter Chang demonstrates 
in his commentaries. Many writers 
would shy away from making such 
strong, unequivocal statements, but 
since this is the wly Olang feels, I'm 
glad he's secure enough to share his 
feelings with the rest of us. They il-
lustrate his narrow definition of what 
is important in our society. 

Chang makes many of his priori-
ties clear in his latest column ("Div-
ing Headfirst Into a Real Education," 
May 18). He speaks of a "$120,000 
salary," "nifty toys like $10,000 golf 
clubs," and "Mercedes 500E." I 
would like Chang to consider that 
some UCSD students have loftier 
goals for their future. Thcse include 
learning more about the world we 
live in - the whole world, that is, 
not just the power and money-hun-
gry world he seems to inhabit. He 
accuses UCSD students of accepting 
their fate and settling for what their 
school has to offer. But Chang's per-
sonal studies apparently include 
learning the "ability to slog through 
tedious, repetitious filler" and "quot-
ing the philosophical defense of capi-
talism" to make himself "look eru-
dite and intelligent." Who is really 
settling for a force-fed education? 

Chang refers to multiculturalism 
as "Bolshie mind-mulch." However, 
would it not be wise to study the ideas 
of other adtures to improve whatever 
he perceives 10 be our own? Chang 
recommends reading the books of 

Miyamato Musashi and Sun Tzu, 
whose credentials include slaying 
"over 60 opponents in duels" and 
commanding "ancient China's vast 
army." Might we not also read the 
works of people not interested in kill-
ing their opponents, but instead in 
working together to appreciate each 
other's lives and goals? Chang seems 
to see the world as two groups: those 
who want and those who want to take 
aWay, winners and losers. He cannot 
fathom Ihat we all might be success-
ful without stomping on one another. 

Chang provides, "as a service to 
the university," a list of literature 
for us to read, presumably because 
we .re not learning the right things . 
I will conlinue 10 read my 
Newsweek and Los Angeles TImes 
and occasionally the less stimulat-
ingSan Diego Union-Tribune, if my 
reading the fluff it publishes will 
make him happy. I will also keep 
reading and defending the rights 
enumerated in our Bill of Rights, 
which include Chang'S right to pub-
lish his suggestions for our lives and 
our right to ignore them. 

Finally, Chang refers to the "hate 
mail" he has received. I hope that he 
wi II not inel ude this letter in such a 
group. While I do not care for many 
of his ideas, I have no personal feel-
ings toward tum. On the contrary, I 
hope he will continue to write for the 
Guardian and let us, the "MTV-
addled college students," know ex-
actly how he feels. I will try to hold 
OIl tct'!lY "short attention span" long 
enough 10 shake my head in disbe-
lief at his increasingly silly views.

ConUnuecl from ,... 4 
seems quite rontent to ignore me-
until I raise sucb a fuss that it grudg-
ingly gives me 70 percent of my 
salary for wbich I have done 100 
percent of tbe work. Eventually, the 
university wiD fork over the rest. It's 
treatmenllike this that leads me to 
fantasize about the following sce-
nario: 

UC: "Ms. Lind, we sent you a 
tuition bill last month and we 
haven'l received payment yet." 

II.: "Ob my. That's really a 
sbame. I don't know if I paid it or 
not. Why don't you traipse all over 
town to find out what rould be the 
mailer? Maybe my bank knows. 
You rould ask tbem. If nol, maybe 
you could call the post office to find 
out where the envelope containing 
my check went - that is, if I ever 
sent it." 

UC: "Uh, well, I'm sure you un-
derstand that we have expenses to 
meet. We have to pay our light bill, 
you know, which is quite a bit of 
money .... " 

II.: "I quite sympathize with 
your problem. Let me know what 
you find out." 

This sounds all very well and 
good, but unfortunately, the univer-
sity has all the power in this rela-
tionship. Not only would I never see 
another paycheck, I would report to 
campus to find my class schedule 
canceled and maybe even a few re-
taliatory library fees on my record. 
Defeated by Big Brother, I'd give 
up and head out to the parking lot 
to go home, only to find my car 
towed because of my invalid park-
ing permit. 

Nevertheless, I love the idea of 
writing the university a letter tell-
ing it that I will begin charging it 
late fees for delayed paychecks. The 
problem is that there's no one to teU. 
The graduate coordinators worked 
very hard to sort out my problem; 
blaming tbem would only make 
them feel bad and would get me 
nowhere. 

It's clearly tbe revenge of the

RIMAe: 
ContInued from ..... 1 
sinking of portions of the arena, 
weight .room and men's locker room 
and the cracking of the steps outside 
the facility were a result of Moran's 
failure to properly rompact the soil 
underneatb RIMAe. 

The university claims that it is tbe 
contractor's responsibility to rom-
plete the work specified in the ron-
tract and that it is responsible for 
ensuring the ronstruction is done 
properly. "Moran is saying that they 
were on the job longer, there were 
rain delays and that there were prob-
lems with subsidence that cost them 
money," said Hellman. "The UC is 
saying [Moran] built it and we're not 
responsible for the weatber. [Moran 
was] responsible for making sure the 
compaction was done properly." 

Moran refused to romme!lt. 
However, a memo from Prd'ject 

Manager Jerry Thomas of Moran 
Construction to UCSD stated that 
"[UCSD's] inspection agency has 
not provided ronclusive evidence 
on tbe causes or solutions to these 
problems .... Backfilling operations 
were continuously monitored and 
passed inspection." 

Hellman has acknowledged tbat 
compaction tests wbich were com-
pleted by a university contractor in 
February of 1994 showed tbat soil 
compaction in the affected area was 
sufficient. These test results were 
also used by Moran. 

However, after drainage tests in 
Spring 1994 revealed that several 
pipes had broken under the founda-
tion, additional soil tests determined 
thattbe soil had not been adequattly 
compacted, according to Hellman. 

Hellman said that part of the cur-
rent negotiations are attempting to 
decide how much responsibility the 
original engineering firm will share 
in the repair costs. 

"Our response to this is tbat the 
contractor has a responsibility to test 
bis own work," Hellman said. "I just 
did the testing for my own edifica-
tion. " 

Moran wrote a letter establish-
ing its original claim for an addi-
tional $1.9 million in rompensation 
on May 2,1994. President and CEO 
of Moran Construction Douglas 
Kowert wrote that the rompany was 
seeking additional compensalion "as 
a result of changed project rondi-
tions, missing design information, 
inadequate plans and specifica-
tions ... added scope of work and the 
resulting interruptions. 

In a leiter rejecting tbese claims, 
Hellman wrote, "The schedule in-
creases at tbis time, appear to be the 
ineffectiveness of Moran to appro-
priately manage and staff tbe con-
struction ... it is clear that you really 
have no basis for claims at this time. " 

In addition to negotiations be-
tween Moran and UCSD, several 
RIMAC subcontractors are threat-
ening litigation against Moran for 
failure of payment. 

According to Dave Raspolich 
from tbe Dynalectric Company, 
Moran owes bis rompany over 
$400,000. "Tbey say tbey cannot 
pay our balance because tbe univer-
sity has not paid them," be said. 

Raspolicb said be was frustrated 
witb Moran because tbere bave been 
no attempts at negotiations. "If we 
don't get satisfaction in our negotia-
tions, tbere will certainly be litiga-
tion in the near future," be added.

PRELIMS: Tho 
Triton tracksters head 
for the finals 
Continued from .... 1.2 
distance. Sprowl's exceptional 
mark, an improvemenl on her per· 
sonal best, also qualified her for the 
finals on Friday. 

Every "igmeet has a downside, 
and for the Tritons, it came in the 
form of several atypical perfor· 
mances by consistent standouts. 

Tara Monaghan fouled out of 
the hammer throw and is not eli· 
gible for the finals, while Michele 
Domico was almost two feet off 
her normal seasonal dislances in 
the long jump (16'7.25") - and 
was also unable to advance to the 
finals, 

Other performances during 
yeslerday's festivities were closer 
10 final-caliber efforts for UCSD. 

The women's 4x100 relay team 
- Composed of Sprowl, Damico, 
Joyce Lee and Kenya Thacker -
captured third in its heat with a49.76 
time. The mark was .74 off of the 
squad's 1995 best, but it was still 
not enough to push the Trilons into 
the finals. 

The women's 400,meter hurdles 
event was even more of a heart· 
breaker for junior Michaela 
Monahan. She grabbed fourth in her 
heat in 1 :04.63 and barely missed 
the finals cut by a few tenths of a 
second. 

Triton veteran stars J.J. Castner, 
Lisa Shepard and Randy Buehler 
will compete in their respective pre· 

. liminary events today. 

DUO: Brounstein, 
Ho-both fall in second 
round of NCAAs 
Continued from page 12 
Brounstein said. 

Brounstein's second·round 
draw wasn't much better. He was 
matched up against an extremely 
tough player from Trinity Univer-
sity, and his day in Kalamazoo 
ended with a harsh defeat, 6·2, 6· 
4. However, Brounstein has noth· 
ing to be disappointed about - his 
opponent advanced to the 
quarterfinals and earned All· 
American honors, 

Despite the sudden ending, Ho 
and Brounstein did play up to par 
in Michigan. The Triton tandem 
defended its national rankings and 
also gave UCSD lennis a respect· 
able finish to an up-and-down sea· 
son.

12 SPORTS 

KR8FTY 
DAN KRAIT 

Man Against 
Machine 

Something is rolten in 
Indianapolis when Team 
Penske doesn't qualify a single 
car for the greatest spectacle in 
auto racing, the Indy 500. 

Now, I'm no expert on 
motor sports, but I can tell you 
one thing: I've heard of Roger 
Penske, AI Unser Jr. and 
Emerson Fittipaldi. I know 
they are the best and that 
during their storied careers, 
"Little AI" and "Emo" have 
won a combined four races at 
the most famous racing venue 
on Earth. Why, then, is their 
garage at the Indianapolis 
Motor Speedway empty with 
the big race still to be run? 

I don't know the logistics, 
but the basic idea is that their 
cars weren't good enough to 
get the job done. This fact, 
more than anything else, 
reveals something I've long 
suspected about the sport: 
Auto racing is far too depen-
dent on technology to be a true 
test of who the best driver is. 

The two finest drivers in the 
sport will be spectating rather 
than racing this weekend. In 
what other sport does the 
athlete rely so heavily on his 
equipment? Sure, hockey and 
football players have thei r 
pads; basketball stars have 
their multi-million-dollar shoe 
deals; and baseball players 
have their beloved bats. But no 
other sport would ever see its 
greatest stars sidelined by 
inferior equipment. 

Perhaps the boys from 
Penske should hire Dennis 
Conner as a team spokesper-
son. After all, Dennis knows a 
little about avoiding elimina-
tion through underhanded 
manipulation. "You can't put 
Emo and Little AI on the 
sidelines for the Indy 500," 
Conner would plead with the 
race committee. "Why don't 
we just let them borrow the 
fastest cars on the track and let 
the no-name drivers watch 1" 

Through all this mess, a 
disturbing question quickly 
comes to mind: Are Fittipaldi 
and Junior really that good, or 
has their success been the 
result of superior equipment 
which finally let them down? 

I know that Emo and Junior 
are great drivers, but one really 
wonders. After all, even the best 
drivers can be denied victory by 
a blown gasket, an overheated 
cylinder, or that ultimate 
embarrassment - running out 
of gas. How an any driver 
claim to be in control of the 
outcome in these races? 

I won't argue with the ski II 
involved in maneuvering 
around the track, in and out of 
traffic, at over 200 mph. But [ 
question the claim that drivers 
make at the end of each race: 
"Today, I was the best driver 
on the track." 

Instead, maybe they should 
thank their lucky stars that 
their car didn't break down 
and nobody crashed into them.

NCAA DIVISION III MEN'S TENNIS NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS 

The Triton tandem of Dan Brounsteln and Rob Ho was defeated In the first round at the NCAA Championships In Kalamazoo, MI. 

Duo Downed in Second 
KALAMAZOOED: UCSD's remaining hopes for a title were ousted in second-round singles play 
By Hilary Somers 
Staff Writer 

Even though the season ended 
weeks ago for the UCSD men's ten-
nis team, two of its top players con-
tinuously ventured back 
to the courts, hitting mil-
lions of balls. 

The two persistent 
players, Robert Ho and 
Dan Brounstein, earned 
respectable rankings this 
year in both singles and 
doubles play -and they 
held high hopes of get-
ting into the individual draw at Na-
tionals. 

Their hard work was not 'in vain. 
The NCAA selection committee fi-
nally notified Ho and Brounstein 
that they made it into-both the singles 
and doubles draw. Within a couple 
of days, the tenacious Triton pair 

was off the courts and headed to 
Kalamazoo, MI, for the Division III 
National Championships. 

Ho made it apparent in his first 
round match that he traveled to 

Kalamazoo to play ten-
nis and not sightsee. He 
completely mopped up 
his Connecticut College 
opponent in a two-set-
ter, 7-5, 6-l. 

Brounstein followed 
his teammate's lead, 
coming up with a huge 
win over Amherst 

College's Carl Hutchins, 6-2, 6-2. 
It was an incredible match for 

two reasons. First, Brounstein sim-
ply demolished Hutchins. Second, 
Brounstein finally got back at anold 
nemesis - he had lost to Hutchins 
in three sets during his freshman 
year at UCSD. 

"This was a big match because I 
got my revenge," Brounstein said. 

Later that same day, Ho and 
Brounstein teamed up for 
doubles action . They 
battled a dominating duo 
from Hobart College that 
was the runner-up in the 
Eastern region Rolex tour-
nament. Ho and 
Brounstein were handily 
disposed, 6-1, 6-2. 

In the second day of 
the tourney, Ho ran up 
against a national cham-
pion from UC Santa 
Cruz, who he had faced 
earlier in the year. Ho 
started to battle back in 
the second set, but he w.-
defeated by Josh Vining, 
6-3,7-5. 

really tough draw. Vining is really 
at the top of his game right now,"

NCAA DIVISION III TRACK AND FIELD NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS 

Ylkov ZolotoleY/GuMII., 

R ..... Sprowl qualified for the IonI Jump flnaIs_ 

UCSD Track Thmbles 
STARS: Eryn Houston and Renee Sprowl leap to the fmals 
By Tecld Ladd 
Sports Editor 

Every sport has its own version of "crunch 
time." In basketball, it's standing at the free 
throw line with two seconds 
left. I n baseball, it's stepping 
up to the plate in the bottom of 
the ninth inning. 

Andfor the UCSD track and 
field team, it's competing at 
the NCAA Division III Na-
tional Championships - held 
this week in Northfield, MN. 

With everything on the line, 
strange things can happen, and 
for the Triton trackstelS yesterday'. 
Iiminary events brought a milled bag of 
results. 

The clear highlight for UCSD was long 
jumper - and frequent slam-dunk cham-
pion - Eryn Houston. A senior member of 
the Triton field squad, Houston leaped to a 

23'1.75" mark in his event. 
Houston's distance was 

good enough for third in his 
bracket and seventh overall. 
It placed him easily in the 
finals on Friday, since the top 
12 athletes advance. 

While Houston leapt to 
high marks for the UCSD 
men, Renee Sprowl did some 
stellar jumping of her own for 

the Triton women. Sprowl grabbed first 
place in her division with a solid 18'2"

Initially 
intriguing, Hal 
Hartley's film, 
Amateur, 
ultimately 
disappoints 

The premise behind Hal Hartley's 
(Trust, The U nllelievable TrIIIh) latest 
film, Amateur, sounds promising. Sofia 
(Elina l.owensohn), a porn star, pushes 
her husband Thomas (Martin Donovan) 
out the window of their apartment, thinkI 
he's dead and runs away,only to become 
entangled in a web of murder and in-
trigue. 

ThoIlllS develops amoesia and is 
befrictldedby IiabelleflsabclleHuppert), 
an ex-nun, who swears she's a nympha-
maniac even though she', never had sex. 
1besecharaclers are sooftbeat they could 
have come out of a David Lynch film. 
And yet, the confusing plot and stilted 
dialogue never really amount to much in 
the end. 

Amateur's plot is a quagmire. When 
Sofia leaves Thomas sprawled on the 
sidewalk, she seeks advice from her 
friend Edward (Damian Young), a 
twitchy accountant who made porno 
films with her husband. Sofia starred in 
the films, but hates Thomas for it. 

Edward informs Sofia that he also 
hates Thomas because he was involved 
in trying to blackmail an arms dealer 
named Mr. Jacques with inaiminating 
floppy disks. Sofia tries to strike a deal 
with Jacques, telling him she will give 
him the disks in exchange for money. 
But Jacques doesn't mess around and 
sends his cronies out to kidnap her. In-
stead, they nab Edward and torture him 
by applying electric shocks with a chord 

- from a lamp. Edward becomes a walking 
zombie and is picked up the police, but 
eventually blows his way out of the 
police station to track down Sofia and 
Thomas. 

Meanwhile, Softaencounters Isabelle 
and Thomas at her old apartment as 
Jacques' henchmen are about to torture 
her. Isabelle, who has dressed in one of 
Sofia's dominatrix outfits, saves Sofia, 
and the three escape to the countryside. 

In one of the best scenes in the film, 
Isabelle shows up in the leather outfit at 
her old convent, seeking refuge from 
Jacques' henchmen. The stunned looks 
on the nuns' faces at Isabelle's exposed 
cleavage is one of the movie's few high-
lights. 

While each character genuinely tries 
to confront his or her past (Thomas' is 
ironically the darkest of them all), they 
never reach a final epiphany, even as 
they all their paths converge in the final 
scene. Like Romeo is Bleeding,Amateur 
attempts to combine quirky characters, 
black comedy and artsy scenes but lacks 
any philosophical or emotional point 

Amateuropens tomorrow attheGuiId 
Theatre in Hillcrest.

HIATUS 2 The UCSD Guudian 

The Perez Family 
Film depicts immigrants'.hardships 

By er.I, Stockle 
Staff Writer 

With her playful and saucy film 
The Perez Family, director Mira Nair 
(Mississippi MasaJa) nurtures a fine 
story about Cuban immigrants who 
arrive in Florida and survive 
the bureaucratic and para-
noidarrows Americathrows 
al them. 

Marisa Tomei plays the 
vibrant Dottie Perez, who is 
in search of love, adventure 
and John Wayne, whom she 
thinks she will marry upon 
her arrival in the United States. On the 
boatlift, Dottie encounters the jaded 
Juan Raul Perez (Alfred Molina), a 
former aristocrat held in Cuba as a 

political prisoner, who is going to the 
United States in search of his long. 
lost wife Carmella(Anjelica Huston). 
Upon their arrival, the immigrations 
officer mistakes Dottie and Juan Raul 
as husband and wife beCause they 

share the same last name, 
but Dottie discovers that this 
is to their advantage, be-
cause families have a better 
chance of gaining entrance 
to the United States. 

Though Nair attempts to 
blend comedy with cultural 
and political themes, the 

humor tends to be somewhat awk-
ward. The performances Nair gets 
from hercast areequally mixed. Tomei 
shines as the voluptuous and sassy 

Dottie, and Huston is on par as the 
classy wife-in-waiting. who finally 
gives up waiting for her husband, and 
opts for police detective Pirelli, played 
by 01azz Palminteri (Bullets Over 
BrotlIlway). However, when Alfred 
Molina is alone on the screen, his 
straight-face performance comes off 
as aimless, rather than inspired. One 
begins to hope that the scenes with 
Tomei, or Huston and Palminteri, will 
retum soon. 

In the end, The Perez Family feels 
like a romantic journey that isn't as 
exciting as one would hope, but it still 
provides numerous moments of color 
and humor. 

The Perez Family is playing at 
select theaters in San Diego. 

San Diego Symphony

PJHarvey 
Singer mesmerizes L.A. crowd 
ByJelfN ..... 
Hiatus Editor 

When singer Polly Jean Harvey 
launched into her song "50 Ft. 
Queenie" near the end of her 80-
minute set last Thursday night at the 
Mayan Theatre in Los Angeles, she 
aptly expressed her musical appeal. 
"You want to hear my song, don't 
mess with mel I'm 30 inches long." 
she sang in a feverish pitch. And 
indeed, the presence of the British 
singer extended beyond herdiminu-
tive figure. 

Wearing a tight;- bluish-silver 
dress, Harvey i nvariabl y patted her 
stomach,smacked a tambourine and 
played air guitar with an effective 
combinationofsensuality and show-
manship. 

To the disappointment of some 
fans, Harvey has meUowed with the 
release of her third album, ToBring 
You My Love. She doesn't play gui-
taranymoreand has refined the rough 

edges of her earlier work. Harvey 
devoted most of her 17-50ng set to 
material from Down by the Waler. 

When Harvey played "Driving" 
and followed itwith "SO FL Queenie" 
(both from her second album, Rid of 
Me) her connection with the audi-
ence grew so strong that the bounc-
ers (previously unoccupied) had to 
prevent fans from leaping onstage. 

Harvey, her face painted death-
white and her lips bright red, hardly 
spoke during her performance, but 
her frequent smiles, yelps and 
screarnsspokeplenty about the range 
of emotions she experienced during 
her mesmerizing performance. 

Tricky, a member of Massive 
Attack, was the show's opener. He 
played an appealing, iflow-key, mix 
of dance, blues and hip-hop. Al-
though songs like "Strugglin'" were ' 
sluggish, others such as the uptempo 
"Black Steel," which samples Pub-
lic Enemy, were quite powerful.

In the end, the Fifth succeeds at 

both levels, which is why it's loved in 
the West. It has a glossy, exciting 
sound that guaranteed Shostakovich a 
successful Soviet career, but it has a 
bitter melancholy that people who 
know the circumstances of its writing 
can recognize as a personal indict-
ment. 

Except for the slow third move-
ment, Talmi took the symphony faster 
than normal. The first movement ap-
propriately emphasized the stri~

pened. The metaphor was clear. 

The third movement achieved its 
effect by layering rich melodies over 
hollow harmonies, rendering it lovely 
but ultimately empty, on purpose. 

The finale, as in the Concerto, was 
uncharacteristically he-spirited, fast, 
brassy, very loud and desperate.

Shostakovich left the public scene 
for awhile, mostly because nobody 
wanted to be seen with him, and re-
turned a year later with the Fifth Sym-
phony. His job was to glorify the state, 
and he would be judged by Stalin and 
Pravd4 's musically illiterate critics. It 
was clear that should he fail to please 
them, his life and freedom were in 
jeopardy. Despite the danger, he in-
corporated into this work a rebellious

right playful, creating images of 

Thus ends the San Diego 
Symphony's regular season. Check it 
out over the summer at Pops. It'll be 
playing two kinds of music: the best 
ever conceived (e.g. Beethoven), and 
the worst (e.g. Judy Collins). Hope-
fully, the desperate end of this year 
won't persevere into the next. 9780 Candida St. 566·3881
