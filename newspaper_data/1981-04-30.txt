Assembly acts to increase 
costs for out-of-staters 

BY RICK DOWER 
acramento Correspondent 

An Assembly panel this week approved 
legislation making it much tougher for out·of· 
tate tudent enrolled at state colleges and 

univer itie to e tablish re ident tatu. 
The A sembly Post 'econdary Education 

ubcommittee pas ed the mea ure by Don 
Rogers (R·Bakersfield), to require out·of· tate 
student to prove they have been fihancially 
independent from their parent for three years 
before they would be considered re 'ident . 

Ten thousand non·re ident tudents pay 
around $2,800 to attend the Univer ity of 
California each year. 

The vote was 3·0 on Roger' bill, AB 1175, 
with no oppo ing testimony. The bill will 
apply to the state college and univer ity 
system as well and would take effect fall, 1982. 
. "Thi ' would afeguard California 

taxpayers from non·re ident students taking 
advantage of our cheaper fees," Roger aid. 

At pre ent, UC has what are generally 
considered to be the lowe t student fee of any 
comparable public univer ity in the country. 

The ties that 
bind John Gavin 
are wound by his 
heart and judge 

Subcommittee Chairwoman Tere aHugh 
(D·Los Angele), ugge ted an amendment be 
added to the bill that would also require non· 
resident tudents to how they've been 
financially independent from their parent for 
three year to make it harder to compete with 
resident tudent for tate financial aid 
awards. 

"Thi would be one way to make ure 
someone from Michigan couldn 't come here 
and be able to get financial aid after ju t a 
year," H ughe aid, "while my children wou ld 
have to be independent for at lea t three years 
to be eligible for aid." 

The state definition of financial 
independen e for purpo 'e of applying for 
financial aid i that a student mu t not have 
received more than $ 50 a year from hi or her 
parent. , not lived at home for more than ix 
weeks in a year or been claimed a a tax 
dependent, all over a period of three year .

Some people just can't take no for an 
answer. 

Consider 24·year-old John Gavin, a La 
Jolla resident who frequents the UCSD 
campus. 

Despite a court order restraining him 
from being within 100 yards of the sixth 
floor of Argo Hall, Gavin continues to visit 
the Revelle campus and flirt with arrest. 

In fact, two weeks ago Gavin was taken 
into custody by ~mpus'police, after h~ was 
discovered drmkmg WIth several fnends 
on the third floor of Argo. 

Now free on bail, the non· tudent 
maintains that his rights are being violated 
and that he will be vindicated in court. 

A native of Ohio, Gavin moved first to 
Santa ~rbara and then several years ago 
to La Jolla. where he worked for the Lalo11a 
Village Inn until he was fired recently. 

Soon after moving to thi area. Gavin 
says he began makingfriends at UCSD and 
regularly vi iting the campus. Now. he 
claims he knows over 100 students here in

PLO speaker's address smooth, 
but flawed in light of facts 
Editor: 

I mu t commend Mr. 
Hussaini for his mooth 
address to the audience in 
the Revelle Cafeteria last 
Thursday evening. I f I had 
been Ii tening without any 
previous knowledge of the 
historical and contempor· 
ary ituation in the Middle 
Ea t I would have found it 
very easy to believe what he 
had to say. Fortunately I 
was able to discern between 
the myth and facts of 'his 
statements. I would like to 
take a few moments to 
present some information 
from a factual point of view . . 

Mr . Hussaini , when 
asked about the history of 
the Zionist movement , 
remarked that it had it 
ongln in the late 
nineteenth century under 
the direction of Theodore 
Herzl. He also went out of 
his way to say that there 
were many Jews who 
opposed the movement -
an exaggerated statement. 
It is true that in 1897, Herzl 
did organize the so-called 
modem Zionist movement, 
but that was by no means 
the beginning of Zioni m. 
Its roots date back 1900 

. years to the destruction of 
the Second 'Temple and the 
expulsion of the Jewish 
population from Israel. 
Today's Zionist movement 
is the realization of the age 
old dream of the Jewi h 
people to return to Israel, 
therefore, Mr. Hussaini's 
statement t hat Zionism is a 
modern phenomenon is 
false. 

On a number of occa ions 
Mr. Hussaini spoke of the 
exile of the Palestinian 
people, including himself, 
from their homeland 
because of the Is raeli 
occupation of their land. He 
said they had a right to self· 
determination in J rael , yet 
he failed to recognize the 
right of theJewi h people to 
return to the land they were 
fore d to leave ] 900 ear 
ago. In fa to Mr. Hu aini 
stated that he was skeptical 
of any Jewish connection to 
the land of Israel before the 
turn of the century. The 
historical connection of the 

Jewish people to the land of 
I s rael i s of utmost 
importance to an under-
standing of the present 
s ituation in I rael . and it i 
typical of the PLO and Arab 
nation to den y thi 
connection. 

The historical relation-
ship of theJewi h people to 
the land of Israel date back 
nearly 3.000 year . During 
this time period a Jewish 
tate with a central 

government located in 
Jerusalem existed on three 
different occasions for 
varying lengths of time. 
The fir t Israeli state was 
established approximately 
1,200 years before the 
beginning of the common 
era. 1,981 year ago. It 
lasted for half a milIenium 
until it was conquered by 
the Babylonian empire in 
587 BCE. The second Israeli 
state was created in 167 
BCE as a result of the 
Maccabbean revolt against 
Assyrian rule and lasted 
until the Roman occupation 
of Israel around the year 70 
CEo From that time on until 
the establi hment of the 
present State of I rael 33 
years ago. the Jewish people 
were in exile around the 
world. These are the facts 
which the PLO and Arab 
countries refute. 

The PLO and the 
Palestinian people constant· 
ly reaffirm their right to 
self-determination in Israel, 
but they refuse to recognize 

. theequalrightoftheJewsto 
self·determination in Israel. 
This brings me to my final 
point concerning the exile of 
Palestinians from Israel 
supposedly due to Israeli 
occupation of their land. 

In the land allotted to the 
Jews by the United Nations 
in 1947,over70percentofi t 
had previou Iy been owned 
by the Briti h government. 
It pas ed into the hands of 
the I raeli government 
when the British gave up 
the mandate t hey had 
controlled in Palestine since 
World War I. Only 3.3 
percent of the land was 
act ually owtled and occupied 
by Arabs . The remaining 
land was owned by ab ·entre 

Arab landlords. The claim 
that I raeli were occupying 
Arab land is unfounded. 
The Palestinian refugee 
problem-was created when 
Arab governments hosti le 
to Israel told the Palest in-
ians to leave the country 
while they attempted to 
defeat I rael. early 
600,000 Arabs left. They 
were told that when I rael 
wa defeated they could 
return to their land - as 
well a'that of the Jews. But 
the Israelis were victorious 
in 1948, and the Palestin-
ians who left the country 
fou nd themselves in refugee 
camp on the West Bank 
and the Gaza Strip where 
the governing authoritie 
Uordan and Egypt) refused 
to aid them. When Israel 
occupied those territorie in 
1967 the Arab nation tried 
to thrust the problem in to 
the lap of the Is rael i 
government. The s ituation 
has changed little s ince 
then. 

Most people will argue 
that the plight of the 
Palestinian refugees i a bad 
one in need of a olution. but 
the PLO i dedicated to 
solving it only through the 
use of armed struggle. As 
the self-proclaimed repre· 
sentative of the Palestin· 
ians people, the PLO has 
called for the establishment 
of a state where both Arab 
and Jew can live in peace. 
The PLO refu ses to 
recognize the existence of 
the State of Israel , and until 
it does 0, it can not expect 
Israel to negot iate with it. 
For Israel to allow the 
creation of such a state 
would be to invite suicide, 
for the PLO has repeatedly 
made it clear that the 
e tablishment of uch a 
would only be the fir t step 
toward their ultimate goal 
of creating a Palesti nian 
state in all of I rael. The 
State of Israel and the 
Jewish people as a whole 
cannot allow the creation pf 
such a state simply because 
Hussaini, like the PLO, 
hopes it will not be hosti le 
towards Is rael. 

Daniel Klau 

Hussaini, PLO set double standard 
E d itor: 

I would like to comment 
on the visit of PLO 
represe ntative Hatem 
Hu saini to our campus la t 
Thursday night. 

First, I would agree that 
Hussaini , in his general 
remarks. made a telling 
critique of some of the main 
problem with the present 
Israeli s tate. He first 
pointed out that the state of 
Israel i ba ed on religion-
upon words found in the 
Bible which give Jew a 
divine right to the land of 
Israel. The zealousness of 
religious belief ha been a 
major destructive force in 
the world' hi story for 
thousands of years. I think 
any di cu ion of what to do 
in regard s to I rael· 
Pale tine mu t be made 
independent of such 
religious narrow·minded · 
ness. The second point he 
made was in the form of a 
rhetorical Question to the 

Israeli government, asking 
them what they plan to do 
about the million of 
Palestinians within Israel's 
present border . Are they to 
remain econd -c lass 
citizen, alienated from 
their government by fact of 
religion? Hus aini's claim 
to dream for a secular 
Palestinian state in which 
all religions can live 
together is indeed laudable. 

The Quest ion period 
which followed was 
polluted with a couple of 
nonsensical non- equiturs 
which are unfortunately 
typical of uch gatherings. 
One peaker compared the 
plight of the Palestinians 
with the plight of Mexicans 
whose homeland was ripped 
away by the US (a house of 
cards analogy if there ever 
wa one), and one Que -
tioner tried to drag 
international capitali m 
onto the dock of villain as if 
bv merel aying it i 0 

made it so. In addition the 
meeting was continually 
di rupted by extreme 
hothead on both sides, 
most notably two Zionists 
who e purpose was 
obviously to throw a 
monkey wrench into the 
proceedings. 

However several legiti· 
mate and interesting 
Questions were evaded by 
Mr. Hussaini . First, a 
Question was raised about 
the PLO's explicit denial of 
the existence of a Jewish 
nationality independent of 
religion in much the ame 
way a t he nationality of 
Palestinians is distinct from 
their ethnic, linguistic and 
for the most part religious 
tie to the neighboring Arab 
s tates. Mr . Hussaini 
an wered that he would 
di cu s that que tion, 
"when he was in Jeru a· 
lem," which i to ay he 
refused to discu s it now. A 

Former gun owner 
advocates control 
Editor: 

All my lif I have been an 
opponent to gun control -
that i , until recently. I have 
now changed my beliefs 
complet ely. 

I went home during last 
spring break for a few days. 
The night I arrived home, my 
brother showed me a shiny, 
new .22 caliber pi tol that he 
had gotten for his birt hday. I 
was not at all concerned 
about him owning the gun. 
becau e we both had taken a 
National Rifle A ociation 
gun safety course. I saw that 
he handled the weapon quite 
carefully. 

Later that evening, I 
walked into the den where 
my brother .and his friends 
were watching TV. One of 
the gur was holding my 
brother s pistol. Upon seeing 
me. he leveled the gun at my 
head and snapped the trigger. 
The gun did not go off, but 
had there been a bullet in the 
chamber, I would have been 
killed. 

After mr astonishment 
subsided, began to get 
angry. As I started to tell the 
guy that people are killed all 
the time doing what he just 
did, a sarcastic smile flashed 
across his face. "Jim, I made 
sure it wasn't loaded," he 
said. 

It occurred to me that the 
difference between my life 
and death had been 
determined by whether or not 
there was one small piece of 
lead in that instrument 
across the room. My last 
sight woul~ have been that 

tiny, black hole at the end of 
the barrel. How many time 
have we heard the futile 
excuse: " I didn ' t think it was 
loaded?" 

Accidents with handguns 
are a very common cause of 
death. but many murders and 
uicides are com mitted daily 

with thi cute little weapon. 
too. The reason that we have 
o many homicides and 
uicide with handgun is 

that the pi tol makes t he job 
much more easy. Pulling a 
trigger is much more 
convenient for an as ailant 
than using a knife. Pulling a 
trigger is also a painless and 
instant means for commit-
ting suicide. If we take away 
thi easy·to-u e instrument. 
we shall see a ub tantial 
drop in these crimes. 

There are good points to 
owning a gun. It can be a fun 
sport - I know. It can al 0 be 
a means of elf·defen e. But 
how many burglarie , rapes 
and murders have been 
thwarted with handguns 
compared to the number of 
murder s, suicide and 
accidental deaths that have 
been caused by them? 

I believe that anyone who 
looks at both ides of the 
argument. as I have, will see 
that we need a comprehen· 
sive gun control law. If we all 
speak out, and write to 
congressmen and vote, we 
shall have that law. Many 
people will continue to die 
every day. by handguns, until 
we have gun control. 

Jim Spanier 

ATT profits absence 
Editor: 

The publication in the new 
itJdicalor of Ben Telephone's 
credit codes will not win any 
awards for astute editorial 
policy. But the swift and 
unmeas ured response of 
campus police and the city 
attorney's office makes one 
wonder if the IIi staff were 
not the only ones to get their 
prioritie confused. 

One is reminded of a 
comment uttered recently by 

Dick Gregory in an address at 
Occidental College: "Bell 
Telephone made $5.221.529 
(in 1975) and paid 2 percent 
income tax ... When you file 
your tax. why don 't you say, 
'Hey, babe, I'm gonnapay the 
same thing that AT&T pay. r 
know they good Americans.'" 

If there's a rip·off going on 
- and there does seem to be 
- the trail doesn't lead to the 
new indica/or.

Hey Mr. Budman, 
'Butts to You' 

Editor: 
I would like to addre this 

letter to the Budman of 
intramural fame. After a 
careful a~lysis of hi so· 
cal led predictions, I can only 
assume that he is suffering 
from a severe case of suds on 
the brain. 

He not only failed to 
mention last year' women' 
softball champion "Butt · to 
You," but he predicted 
" Peppers" to win in "Butt to 
You ' " league thi sea on. I 
hate to embara the 
Budman or "Pepper ," but 
had fie checked this season's 
scores, he would have seen 
that "Butts to You" beat 

"Peppers" two weeks ago by 
a score of at lea t 30·2. "Butt 
to You" took last year' snu b 
by the budman in stride s ince 
they were a new team, but 
now that they are established 
as the team to beat, it's high 
time they got some of the 
recognition they deserve. J 
invite the Budman out to ee 
"Butts to You" play in their 
next game 0 that he can see 
what true talent is . If he still 
feel the sam after see ing 
"Butts to You" play, then 
maybe he would like to put 
hi money where his beer 
mug is.

Stop male exploitation now 
Editor: 

J n reference to those 
individuals who wrote to you 
la t week (Guardian. April 
21) after being offended by 
the Martial Art s Club 
screeing of Bel A mi, I would 
Ii ke to relate a s im ilar 
experience which some 
friends and I uffered 
through a few week ago. 

We were walking through 
downtown San Diego, and 
out of the spirit of curio ity, 
we decided to attend a boxing 
match which was being held 
in a local arena. When we 
were finally seated inside, we 
were shocked and appalled at 
the spectacle before us: two 
men, nearly nak ed and 
sweating profusely , were 

standingon a rai ed platform 
in the center of the room 
hitting each other! Not only 
was the audience tolerating 
this overtly aggressive 
behavior. but they seemed to 
be actually encouraging it! 
From all around us we heard 
shouts such as. "Knock hi 
balls off, slitface! " or "Die, 
you fucking fudge· packer. " 
In addition, many members 
of the audience were buying 
beer in paper cup, and then 
leaving the paper cup on the 
floor, creating a horrible 
mess for someone else to 
clean up. 

It i this type of behavior 
which perpetuates the role of 
men as targets of violence. 

We feel we must deplore in 
the strongest terms this 
attempt by certain "non-
pacifi tOO egment of society 
to portray violent behavior 
without underlying ho tility, 
aggressivene s without 
hatred . It is our view that 
violence hould be the result 
of antagonistic feelings, not a 
money-making vehicle for 
ome group of businessmen 

who have never so much a 
s poken sharply to their 
mothers. 

We urge all the students of 
UCSD to boycott boxing 
events. Let 's wipe out 
unemotional violence in our 
lifetime.

received Tuesday as a ktter to 
thi! editor.) 

On Friday, May I, student 
will have a uniqueopportuni· 
ty to hear an on·the·scene 
report about the strike 
currently underway in one 
of the nation's most 
important energy industries, 
a strike which is receiving 
very little lJulblicity on the 
west coast. We are referring 
to the month-old strike by the 
United Mine Workers 
Association (UMWA) against 
the Bituminous Coal 
Operators Association. 

On May I, Chuck Parker, a 
miner and editor of the Coal 
Field Defender, will be 
speaking at UCSD. His wife. 
Bessie Lou Cornett , is one of 
the articulate community 
women seen in several 
scenes of the academy· 
award·winning documenta· 
ry, Harlan County USA, 
which many students are 
familiar with. 

The tragic death just two 
weeks ago of 15 miners in a 
mine explosion in Colorado 
calls even more attention to 
one of the most important 
issues in the st rike : 
protection of health and 
safety. In the context of the 
Reagan administration's 
drastic cutback in Black 
Lung Disease benefits to 
miners, 70% of the UMWA 
membership voted in March 

to reject the contract which 
had been negotiated by the 
union president, Sam 
Church. The contract was 
rejected (1) because it 
retreated on protection of 
health and safety and (2) 
because it did not respond to 
the fact that coal companies 
are mining more and more 
coal from non·union mines in 
the west, and less and less 
coal from the unioni zed 
mines in the ea t, thus 
undermining the miners' 
position in the east and 
failing to protect western 
miners-many of whom are 
Mexican and Native Ameri· 
can-from the abuses miner 
have had to fight against for 
decades. 

Chuck Parker is on the 
editorial ooard of the Coal 
Field Defender, an indepen· 
dent United Mine Worker 
paper which has played an 
Important role in calling for 
the unionization of western 
coal mines and exposing 
activities of the KKK in 
eastern miningcommunitie . 
Mr. Parker is also the former 
Financial Secretary of Local 
3453, District 17 of the 
UMWA in West Virginia. 
He will be peaki ng at an 
informal reception to be held 
May 1 at 4:00 in the Center 
for the People, and again at

Two Regents get Senate 
approval; Brown huttg-up 
Frank Clark, ·Willis Harman will begin terms; 
both won't say what their nuke lab policy is 

BY RICK DOWER 
Sacramento Correspondent 

Two more of Gov . Jerry Brown's 
appointments to the UC Board of Regent have 
sailed through their Senate confirmation 
hearing without a hitch . 

The Senate Rules Committee unanimously 
approved the nominations of Frank Clark, 64, 
and Willis W. Harman. 63, and sent their 
names to the full Senate, where final approval 
is now but a formality. 

Clark , a partner in a Lo Angeles law firm 
and executive of th May Compan y 
department store', has a lengthy background 
as a director of various charitable foundations. 
His term will expire in 1988. 

Harman is professor of engineering and 
economic ystem at Stanford and also 
specializes in humanistic psychology and 
ocial policy analysis . Harman's appointment 

to the board runs until 1990. 
Both men were appointed by Gov. Brown 

last September , along with record company 
executive David Geffen, already approved by 
the committee, and San Francisco 
As emblyman Willie Brown, yet to be 
confirmed. 

Clark and Harman were approved swift ly 
and without much questioning at the end of a 
long committee agenda. Unlike Geffen, the 
two were not pres ed by committee member 
to present their views on whether the 
University should continue to operate the two 
federal nuclear weapons and energy 
laboratories at Lawrence Livermore and Los 
Alamos. N.M. 

It wa rumored at the time of Clark, 
Harman and Geffen's appointments that the 
governor was tryins to stack the board with 
votes against continuing UC's ties to the 
nuclear labs , but it didn't turn out that way. 

At a crucial fall vote on the ubject, the new 
appointee either didn't attend or abstained 
from voting, and Gov. Brown 's move to sever 
the ties was dumped. 

Before Wednesday's hearing, Harman said 
he is inclined to support the continued UC 
operation of the labs but "that doesn 't mean 1 
support US defense policies" or doesn't 
question such a role of a university . 

Harman said he wasn't sure why the 
governor had appointed him in the first place 
and had even tried to talk Brown out of it. 

Clark, like Geffen , maintained after the 
hearing that he has not made up his mind on 
the University's nuclear connection. "I will 
vote as 1 see fit, if and when the issue comes up 
again," Clark said. 

Sen. Barry Keene (D·Mendocino), who has 
introduced a recent bill to include the Regents 
under the state agency open meeting law, 
asked Clark if he supported such legislation. 
Clark aid he supports the concept of more 
open meetings, where practical, "to the fullest 
extent possible." 

Referring to Geffen, and possibly to ex officio 
regent Lt. Gov. 'Mike Curb, also a record 
executive, Rules Committee Chairman David 
Roberti facetiously asked why Clark and 
Harman had been appointed since they don't 
represent any rock groups. 

"You're not ~ents for vocalists," joked 
Roberti, "so 1 don t know why you feel you're 
qualified for the job." 

This week's approvals of the regent 
appointees now leaves only Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown still to face the five·member 
Senate Rules Committee. 

Although it eems unlikely Brown will have 
any trouble clearing the committee, he has 
successfully stalled his confirmation hearing, 
perhaps hoping to defuse public controversy 
over hi appointment. 

Gov. Brown's selection of the other Brown 
as a Regent has ruffled some official feathers 
and stirred considerable debate, since the 
state constitution says a legislator may not be 
appointed to the Board of Regents, and Brown 
already holds an ex officio eat because of his 
po ition as leader of the state Assembly. 

Brown has recently introduced conflict of 
interest legi lation that would prohibit UC 
Regents from holding stock in the same 
companies the university also invests in. 

In a related development, the University is 
now three weeks overdue in reporting the 
Regents' financial statements, which detail

Charging that Gavin was

succeeded In acquiring a 
restraining order that 
prohibits him from coming 
within 100 yards of her sixth 
floor Argo room or place of 
work. 

Baxer is restrained from 
appearing within 100 years of 
Gavin's residence in La Jolla. 

Although Baxer would not 
discuss her relationship with 
Gavin or her case with the 
Guardian, court records 
detail her complaints of a 
long history of harrassments 
by Gavin. 

such a degree that she had to 
be escorted across campus on 
severa l occasions, and 
suffered "emotional stress." 

Finally, Haxer appealed to 
the court for help. 

Her case never made it to 
trial. Instead, a Superior 
Court judge imposed mutual 
restraining order on Gavin 
and Baxer. 

Noguilt was determined in 
the case, and Gavin says his 
"culpability has been 
assumed" unfairly. Calling 
the restraining order a "bad 
mark" on his previously 
clean record, Gavin says he 
has "not really had my day in 
court. "

In addition, Gavin was 
fired from his La Jolla Village

it on alleged pres ure from 
UCSD officials. 

He also says the restrain-
ing order is unfair becau e 
Baxer will graduate long 
before the order expire in 
February of 1984. 

In fact , Gavin describes hi 
involvement with Baxer 
during the fall a only the 
painful outcome of a 
relationship gone sour. and 
denies ever having harrassed 
Baxer. 

Both agree. however, that 
their relationship had died by 
the beginning of fall quarter. 
when Baxer moved from her 
ummer residence back onto 

campus. 
In an attempt to "bring us 

back together," Ga vi n 
painted Baxer' s room 
"tastefully" in pa tel pink 
and green without her 
permission or knowledge. he 
says. A resident hall janitor 
had allowed Gavin to enter 
the· room. 

"I thought is wa very well 
done," Gavin says. " I figured 
she wouldn't be terribly 
upset...that it might even 
bring us back together." 

Baxer, however , objected 
strongly to the painting and 
had her room repainted . 
, Baxer also complained in 
her court statement that 
Gavin sent her unwanted 
gifts, left her notes and 
followed her on campus. 

Gavin denies that he ever 
followed or surveilled Baxer, 
although he "came up or saw 
her once a week." 
"I was under the 

impression that she didn't 
want me to talk to her," 
Gavin recalls . " I was hurt. " 

According to Gavin, he 
nearly met with violence 
when a male student friend of 
Baxer's threatened Gavin 
with physical harm if he did 
not "layoff" Baxer. 

But instead. Gavin ays he 
and his would ·be assailant 
talked briefly and "became 
friends." 

Gavin's first brush with 
the campus police took place 
soon after this confrontation. 
a week after a temporary

UC faculty salary increas,es considered 
CPEC notes' inflation, salaries at comparable universities should be examined 

BY RICK DOWER 
Sacramento Correspondent 

Faculty at the University 
of California may need only a 
5.75 percent pay increase for 
next year, little more than 
half what the UC Regents 
have asked forfrom the state. 

Or, faculty may need a 
raise of at least 10 to 12 
percent, more than what the 
Regents requested . 

It lfIl depends on how you 
look at it, according to the 
California Postsecondary 
Education Commission, 
which has released a report 
for the Legi lature outlining 
various factors to consider 
when lawmakers begin 
deliberations on UC faculty 
salaries . 

The report listed three 
major areas - this year's 
inflation rate, salaries in the 
private sector and salaries for 
faculty at other comparable 
US universities - as the 
main indicators of how 
legislators should arrive at 
salary adjustments for UC's 
5,000 professors. 

"It is not a simple problem 
figuring out what a s alary 
increase should be," said Bill 
Storey, who compiled the 
hefty report on faculty wages 
for CPEC and the Legisla· 
ture. "What we're trying to 
do is provide the broadest 
possible information for the 
legislators to work with." 

He emphasized CPEC is 
not making recommenda· 
tions as to what faculty 
salaries should be, only 
providing "choices" for the 

legislature. 
CPEC. the state's indepen· 

dent watchdog for public 
higher education, said in the 
report that UC faculty should 
be paid at least 5.75 percent 
more next year to maintain 
parity with faculty at other 
comparable prestigious 
universities nationwide, 
including Stanford, Yale, 
Harvard and Michigan. 

But the commission study 
warns that comparability 
should not be used as the only 
guideline. 

On the other hand, if the 
current inflation rate is to be 
the primary consideration in 
setting salaries, UC faculty 
probably deserve 10 to 12 
percent or more, although 
there is disagreement over 
which is the best index to 
accurately measure inflation. 

Storer said inflation will 
prohabl y be the main 
cO:lsideration of the 

legislature thi year. 
This report on faculty 

alaries in higher public 
education also noted th is year 
that skyrocketing housing 
prices in California,

salary competition in 
technical fields from p:-' . d.:e 
industry would also be 
weighed when the Legisla-
tur:e ~in del!berations on 
umversltY'pay Increases. 

In their fall budget request, 
the UC regents asked for a 9.5 
percent salary hike for 
faculty, sayin~ it was one of 
the university s top priorities 
to help attract new facultr, 
and slow a "brain drain' 
from the university to the 
private sector. 

Last yea r , UC faculty 
received about a 10 percent 
raise, the same as all other 
state employees. Salaries 
... 

increases for UC faculty are 
proposed separately and are' 
not the same as other state 
workers get . 

A full profes or at UC now 
earn $28,300, an associate 
professor $25,000 and an 
assistant professor $21,000. 
Professors who teach in UC 's 
profesional schools of 
medicine and law and 
veterinary earn substantially 
more . 

The report said there is 
"mountin~ and credible 
testimony' suggesting that 
the university's departments 
of business, computer 
science, engineering and 
some physical sciences are 
beginning to have trouble 
recruiting qualified faculty , 
in part because UC salaries In 
those fields can't keep pace 
with private industry.

predicts that the stiffer residency rule alone 
could save California taxpayers at least $5 
million the first year it applies. 

Hamm recommended tightening non-
resident rules in February in his annual 
budget review, and has also suggested raising 
out·of·state tuition by 50 percent to net the 
state another $10 million . 

Rogers' legislation , if approved by the full 
Assembly, would have the probable effect of 
forcing many non·resident students at UC to 

pay for an extra two years at the higher tuition 
rate before they can be considered residents. 

At the moment, out·of-state students need

the university's 5,000 
professorial ranks will fare. 

Governor Brown has not 
proposed any specific figures 
for increases, but has set 
aside a $500 million pot for 
"economic uncertainties" 
that the money for all raises 
for state workers will 
probably be taken from. That 
pot will be under ronsidera·

sources as well this fiscally

GOP wants

AA monies 

BY RICK DOWER 
Sacrome nto Cor rCbl)Ondent 
All affirmative act ion 

program for pu blic higher 
edu catio n wo uld be 
e lim ina t ed, a nd t he 
Universi ty of California 's 
proposed budget would be 
slashed by $67 million 
nex t year under an 
alternat ive state budget 
propo al suggested .f-pril 
21 , by SenateRepubhcans. 

In a press conference, 
Republican Senate Minor-
i ty Le ader Wi lliam 
Campbell called h i 
party s p,roposal "unpre-
cedented ' and " a Republi-
can blueprint" for running 
state governmen t_ 

The document , touted at 
the press conference , 
outlines ways to save the 
state $1.6 billion over Gov. 
Brown's budget but which 
could really save only 
about $300 million at the 
out ide becau e offunding 
shift . It is endorsed by all 
17 members of the Senate 
Repu blican caucus. 

React ion to t he Republi· 
cans' su~estion to axe all 
affirmative action efforts 
at the Uni versity of 
California, the stat e .; 
colleges and the commu-
nity colleges was swift 
from Assembly Speaker 
Wi llie Brown. 

"They can just forget 
about that ," Brown said 
later. 

"They can just forget 
it. " 

According to th e 
alternative budget, "all 
students should have 
equal access to the 
University of California 
system and hould be 
admitted and survive 
based on their individual 
abilities. We cannot 
s upport prefer ential 
treatment.. . " 

Th e propos al al so 
suggests that the entire 
student affirmative action 
port ion of the governor's 
budget for UC be scrapped 
to ave taxpayers $4.4 
mi ll ion . Th ey a lso 
recommend ending the 
affirmative action pro-
grams at the s tate colleges 
and community colleges to 
save another $45 million. 

The bu l k of the 
Republi ca ns ' proposed 
savings in their alterna-
tive budget for UC depend 
on three recommenda-
tions: increas ing facu lty-
student contact time from 
27.5 to 30 hours a week , 
and fi r ing facu l ty , 
reducing the number of 
graduate students system-
wide by 1.350 and deleting 
funds for requested space 
and computer research 
centers at the university. 

" T h e s e k ind s of 
suggestions iust confuse 
the i sue ,' said UC 
Lobbyist Lowell Paige. " I 
can't see any good that will 
be accomplished by it." 

The reduction in 
graduate enro ll ments , 
according to the Republi-
cans, would tota l $4 
mill ion next year. The 
Regents had asked for a 
$1.3 million increase, for 
graduate students, which 
was granted last week br. 
an A embly budget pane , 
but the Republicans want 
to return to a level of two 
year ago.

A short talk \\lith Young 
Interest in computer dialogue 

BY MIKE THOMA 
Staff Wriler 

Malcolm Young is a tall , 
lanky graduate tudent who 
could ea ily be mistaken for a 
victim of the recession with 
his shorn pate, hollowed 
cheekbones and un haven 
stubble on his chin . But 
before you go out to buy him a 
CARE package, don' t worry , 
Malcolm's doing fine. His 
di heveled appearance i due 
to hi being an actor in the 
Cassiu Carter production of 
Erich Maria Remarque' play 
Full Circle in which he ha 
the lead role of an escaped 
concentration camp pri oner. 

I met with Mr. Young at 
the Che Cafe recently, and we 
talked about t he theatre, the 
UCSD Drama Department 
and Malcolm' pa ' ion for 
restoring old sport car . 

"Who are some of your 
favorite actors?" J asked . 

"Oh, probably some you've 
never heard of. David Dukes 
is a remarkable actor, and 

he's unknown out side of 
Broadway. He's don quite a 
few things that ha e reallx 
moved me. He wa in Bell!. ' 

"The play with Richard 
Gere?" 

"Yes, but he's a much 
better actor than Cere. He 
was alsoi n Traves ties by Tom 
Stoppard . Anoth r fine 
a tor i David Ogden Stier ." 

"The gu y that plays 
Charles on M*A* *H?' 

"Right , but he's don 
much more. I worked with 
him in a play Wild Oats by 
O'Keefe, and h ' . one of th 
mo t inventive and giving 
actors I've ever worked with . 
He'll play King Lear at the 
Old Globe this summer." 

"You tudied at • tanford 
as an undergraduate. What 
brought you to UCSD?" 

"There are excit ing things 
happening here, the whole 
department i very strong. 
Although you wouldn't know 
it from the amount of 

altent ion it get here on 
campus, the Drama Depart -
ment h re is cons idered one 
pf the finesl in t he coun try; 
back in ew York it has a 
great deal of pre t ig ." 

" WhM would vou like to do 
aft er you graduate?" 

"Oh , I'd like to travel for 
awhile and then j in a rep 
compan y somewhere. I'm 
in t rested in a project right 
now in volving compul er 
~enerated dial gu . I'm al ' 0 
mterested in thing like the 
Dario Fo productions in It aly 
that provide a confrontation-
al experie nc e for the 
audience, but do it with a 
en e of humor . It 's 

blantantly political. but done 
along the lines of I LO/Je Lucy, 
and it' s very popular with the 
audiences. That's the kind of 
theatre thai move' me, when 
it becomes something more 
than just an entertainment 
and in tead turns into a 
shared experience bet ween 
the audience and players ."

tlOn were elsewhere in im-
pre s ioni tic painting. Thi , 
along with a deplorable lack 
of equipment (one videotape 
deck, one camera, and one 
monitor) directed her to a 
3000 mile trek to UCSD and 
for what Peacock regards as 
"a cross section of significant 
areas of art·making" to be 
fou nd in the university's 
Visual Arts department. 

Her three year long process 
of relocation and readju t-
men t is. the su bject of her 
entry , CalIfornia Freeze·Oul. 
According to Peacock, it is a 
"cultural and autobiograph-
ical poetic mapping" in 
which its use of polar images 
(hot and cold, sand and snow) 
serves a "a metaphor for all 
sorts of internal conflict." 
The tape is actually the 
second part of a triology. The 
first tape, entitled Inventing, 
deals with the reeon truct ion 
of events from memory,one's 
pas t as fi ction and its 
di ffering relations hip to the 
ever-fluctuating present. The 
third tape, called News From 
In Between, i concerned with 
the sy nthesization of past 
and present. 

"It's a focal tape," said 
Peacock of California Freeze· 
Out. ''I'm glad it got some 
attention, " 

Equally happy to be 
recognized for his efforts is 
Matuck. HaiJin~ from Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, he studied 
co mmuni catio ns as an 
undergraduate and came to 
UCSD in the faB of 1978. In 
addition to video, he has 
pu b1 ished three graphic art 
works: a booklet on copyright 
law s, anot her book let 
protesting the use of animals 
for experimentation and a 
flyer proposing the creation 
of an international symbol, 
Semion , for relea s ed 
information as an alternative 
to the copyright symbol. The 
first two were produced 
while attending the Univer· 
sity of Sao Paulo. Matuck 
chose to include video into 
this art-making for its ability 
to reach a wider audience. 

" It's easier to do," he 
add~. 

Most of hi work in this 
area has been done in a 
documentary format , such as 
his a of yet unedited tapes on 
undocumented workers in 
Mexico. His entry, Incande-
scence-Circuit, is his fictional 
attempt. It is based on a 
series of science fict ion 
stories written by him that, 
according to Matuck, "deal 
with an imaginary planet 
cal led Megga, which is like a 
metaphor for Earth. It is 
derived from an interest in 
other work against animals 
slaughtered for food, science, 
sports and hunting. 1 use this 
imagery to talk about this 
planet on which they 
experiment on humans and 
have scientific logic to justify 
it." 

The project is broken down 
into five parts, The first part 
is an introduction of Megga 
via a radio broadcast which 
requests the disconnection of 
receivers for those without 
scientific c1earance_ The 
second part communicates 
the planet's wish to, in 
Matuck's words, "expand 
their civilization into the 
zone of fire and send other 
Meggan into the zone of fire 
to ee how they respond."

dur ing warm-ups and 
continued to cavort during 
the performance. Sure. we all 
botched it a few times, but 
that was an integral part of 
the fun! This was one of those 
few occasions in life where 
the pressure is off, and one 
can totally and unreservedly 
enjoy the experience itself, 
without agonizing over the 
end products. So it becomes 
existential experience, 
execu ted ou t of sheer 
enjoyment and not motivated 
by what someone else wiII 
think. 

The (experi mental) 
element, I think, is of equal 
importance to t he integration 
of dance in the community in 
that it presents an opportu n· 
ity to amateur dancers who 
might not ot herwise be able 
to experience the excitement 
of performing before an 
audience. Rea li stically 
speaking, the unpredictabil· 
ity of fate and the inequitable 
distribution of the talents of a 
Mikhail Baryshnikov or a 
Twyla Tharp mean that the 
chances of making the big 
time are pretty slim. As a 
result. frust rated dancers 
must look for alternative 
outlets for this mode of self· 
expression, and activities 
such as those at UTC this 
past weekend offer them-
selves as necessary alterna-
tives. 

If expan ion of one's 
awarene is any indicat ion 
of the value of an experience, 
then Friday's performance 
certai nl y satisfied that 
requirement. I recognized 
that. also recognizing the 
limitation of my own 
talents. I don't have to be a 
Twyla Tharp to dance - I 
can be me and dance!

The Budman Reports Volleyball 
THE BUDMAN IS OBVIOUSLY NO 

JIMMY THE GREEK. The Budman 
meditated hours over who he thought 
would corne out on top of our softball 
leagues. Well not everybody's perfect. I 
admit I've mis d a pick or two in the past. 
But how did I know that the 'BANANA 
SLUGS' were really slug ? They played the 
BIOHAZARDS in the Bud game oftheweek 
and got crushed 11·1. How was I to 
know ... Troy Kirk, the Banana lugs 
fearless leader, had been dropping hints all 
week that his squad wasthenext best thing 
to Dave Winfield's contract ! 

BROWN UGAR in the Worn n'!. League 
looked a~ invincible as Fernando 
Valenzuela's pitching arm. They had won 
theirf,rst two games bya almbinedscoreof 
33-9. They were playing a team called the 
OLDIE & MOLDIES. Now come on, how 
did IknowtheOLDIE &MOLDlESwerea 
pick up squad of cuts made by the New York 
Yankees? They defeated BROWN SUGAR 

1~5 . Well, you can't pick them all..Jimmy 
The Greek even picked the ew Yorklets to 
win the Super Bowl. oeven the best lose a 
few. 

ALL YOU WATERPOLO ENTHU I· 
AST , e pecially you whogot turned away 
becau of too many leams. can applaud the 
great news. That is, the pas ing of the 
Student Referendum to build a new 
wimmmg pool and racquetball courts. 

Could it be possible that Innertube 
Water polo will surpass softball a our 
billKest sport? Only tim will tell. 

SPEAKING OF IN ERTUBE WATER· 
POLO. a tradit ion in our waterpolo 
program has been that very few teams sign 
up for our top divi ion. Thi dIvision i 
supposed ly for the best innertub 
water polo players in the sch 1. But that 
can't be true, as orne of the best talent in 
polo u ually sIgn up to play in the lower 
diviSIOn. 'ORDINARY PEOPLE ' IS an 
excellent example of talent. They've had 
orne real close games though. Let's see, th 

scores of their game. were 3().O (1 wonder if 
they -weated toget a hutout),31·0(they'r 
getting ~tronger) and 21·2 (com on your 
gu ys, you're really lett ing down) . They 
don 't ~ound ord inary to me ... 

'FLOTSAM & JET AM /I' is another 
perennially top rated team in 'A ' league. 
They have a goalie who can it in his tube 
and touch both sides of the pool at once. The 
only other person who ever did this was 
KAREEM ABDUL·JABAR when the Lakers 
worked out at UCSD. This is their fourth 
year in single A. Come on guy ! Th 
B DMA is going to suggest that these 
squads bypa th AA playoffs and go right 
to the World Championships in Rulgaria. 

ONE LAST THO GHT 0 WATER· 
POLO FOR YOU VALVE STEM LOVER . 
I just thought I'd mention how dynasties 
are created. The owner of the team FOUL 
PLAY thought they'd go out and recruit 
another leam to go into the AA league. 
There usually are'nt enough good teams to 
get a good even league going. So these nice 
people scrounged up some players and 
formed a leam they hoped would be 
ompetitive. Competitive? Did they call the 

New York Yankee dynasty compet itive? Do 
you call the 400 meter high hurdl 
competitive when Edwin Mose. is running? 
I don't think so, These guys are so good we 
hear they don't even use a goalie in the 
second half-sometimes. They even went 
to San Francisco to recruit one of the best 
egg beaters on the west coast. We also hear 
Flipper was cut from the squad because he 
swam too slowly, I think we may make 
them tie one foot to the tube. 

VOLLEYBALL EASON I NOW I 
FULL SWING. We hear Chuck 
Millenbaugh has been turning out some 
excellent talent so the budman wanted to 
take a I k for himself. He went to see a 
titanic match between GOOD CHOWDA 
and AWWWRIGHT. This was an AA 
match that could be a prevIew of the finals 
in AA, Boy, can these guys play, There was 
enough great ' piking and dlggmg that I 
Scates, UCLA's \011 yball coat'h, should 
come down to see t hest' guy~ play. I hear 
that this I also Good Chowdas' last stand, 
These l,'Ilys have been around here ~o long

UCSD won twoofthethree 
2.000 meter races la s t 
Saturday at Mission Bay in a 
duel meet with Long Beach 
State University. 

UCSD captured first and 
second place in thej.V. Ei~ht 
with Long Beach finishmg 
third. It was an easy victory 
for UCSD. with Long Beach 
and UCSD's second boat 
fighting for second. At the 
] ,BOO meter mark UCSD's 
second boat was less than a 
second behind Long Beach. 
But due to an excellent 
fini hing sprint. UCSD 
moved past Long Beach and 
into second place. 

In the second race. the 
Lightweight Four. UCSD 
made a surprise come from 
behind victory over Lon~ 
Beach, with the UCSD "B 
boat finishing third. 

Pat Moreton, the stroke of 
the lightweight four, felt that 
their "come from behind" 
victory was due to the crew's 
inability to accept defeat. 
"All four of us had just rowed 
in the winning j.V. boat and 
we were hungry for another 
win." 

The Heavyweight eight 
race was the only race 10 t by 
UCSD that day. Here it was a 
battle between brains and 
brawn, with brawn becoming 
the victor. UCSD, although a 
much smaller crew, took an 
early lead , but slowly the 
bigger Long Beach crew 
moved into the lead . UCSD 
hung'on and pulled together a 
valliant sprint, only to come 
up four tenths of a second 
short of victory. 

John Kirchmeier. the 
men's coach, said. "They 
rowed better and smarter 
than Long Beach. unfortu· 
nately they came up a bit 
short."

should be an ideal 
barometer of the potential 
for the men in the coming

Angeles and 1984! Brazil is 
perenially in the top seven 
in all world tournaments 
and will provide a 
formidable opponent. USA

opportune moment to test 
their charges against some

Hussaini's speech 
smooth but flawed 

continued from page 11 
Judith Edwin , who has 
discussed the charge of 
harrass ment with both 
Baxer. Gavin and Revelle 
Dean Ernie Mort , believes 
Gavin is intentionall y 
attracting the attention of 
campus police by appearing 
in Argo in the hopes of getting 
"his day in court." 

"He wants to get all the 
attention he can get," Edwin 
say . "He's co n tantly 
around. He's doing it strictly 
to get attention _" 

According to Edwin , Gavin 
ha contacted campu police 
on several occas ions to 
inform them of his proximity 
to Areo. 

The Guardian first learned 
of Gavin's story when he 
contacted the newspaper. 

Such action demonstrat es 
that Gavin "is glorying in the 
feeling that the more 
publicity he gets, the better 
he feels, " Edwin believe . 

Gavin is schedul ed to 
appear in court today.

Pacifi ca, the 1979 USVBA 
Men " Open champion , 
headed by Dick Carl on. 

Bu t finall y, after much 
can ideration of all the 
benefits of both cities, the 
USVBA has decided on San 
Diego. The leading citizen of 
that city, at least in so far as 
getting the men's team there, 
i Don Sammis, who ha been 
a volleyball advocate for 
many year ' and mo t 
recently was involved with 
the Salt Lake City "Sting" 
franchise in the International 
Volle y ball Assoc iati on 
professional league. Hi 
enthusiasm, leadership and 
personal commitment to the 
uccess of the program in hi 

city was the decidinR factor. 

continued from page 2 
second question concerned 
the vio lence of PLO 
activities and especially its 
predilection for attacking 
I raeli children. [f the PLO 
truly wants peace, why is it 
not the firs t to throw down 
its weapons? Mr_ Hussaini's 
an wer consisted of 
counterclaims that Pales-
tinian children were being 
killed too, and that this was 
war. 

This brings us to the 
main reason why Mr. 
Hussaini came to speak at 
UCSD: the PLO is trying to 
win the heart and minds of 
American to its cause, or at 
least to plant seeds of doubt 
within those of us who have 
unwaveringly s upported 
Israel. However, his refusal 
to answer legitimat e 
questions can only hurt his 

cause_ His refusal to admit 
that a Jewish nation exists 
can only strike an ominous 
note in a nation which 
successfully combatted the 
horrors of Nazism in World 
War n. And. the PLO's 
refusal to be the fir t to lay 
down their weapons so as to 
prove themselves be/ler 
than the Israelis means that 
they are, at best, equal to 
the Israelis in brutality and 
violence. For Americans, 
and especia ll y gentile 
Americans like myself , will 
not stop s upporting 
tweedle-dum in order to 
support tweedle-dee. Until 
the PLO can prove itself 
better by its word and 
action • it will get nowhere 
among the Americans it is 
so desperately courting.
