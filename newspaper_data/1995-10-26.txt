$10,000 of SIO Equipment Stolen 
THEFT: Detectives 
unsure whether facility 
was left unlocked 
By Anand Pate' 
Guardian Reporter 

Staff members at Nierenberg Hall 
in the Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography reported the theft of over 
$10,000 of computer equipment last 
Monday, Oct. 23. 

According to Detective Nate 

Floyd of the UCSD police depart-
ment, a computer monitor and four, 
eight-millimeter tape drives- high-
capacity storage devices for com-
puters -were stolen over the course 
of the weekend. 

The tape drives cost roughly 
$2,500 each, while the monitor is 
valued at $500. 

Police said the thefts occurred in 
two separate rooms inside 
Nierenberg Hall, and that the com-
puter monitor was taken from Room 

322, while the tape drives were sto-
len from Room 422. 

Floyd said a staff member was 
last seen in the area at 7:30 p.m. on 
Sunday night. The following morn-
ing, another staff member discov-
ered that the equipment was missing 
and notified the police at 8:10 a.m. 
Floyd said he believes the items 
were stolen during that twelve-hour 
period.

Student Regent Ed Gomez Encourages 
UCSD Students to Apply for His Position 
PROCESS: 
Students must send in 
applications by Nov. 3 
By Chrt. Schreiber 
Guardian Reporter 

The time has come - once 
again - to begin the selection pro-
cess for the new UC student regent. 
Ed Gomez, the current student re-
gent, was at UCSD Tuesday trying 
to drum up enthusiasm for the soon-
to-be-vacant post. 

Assisted by A.S. Vice President 
External Brian Dowd and UC Stu-

dent Association (UCSA) Repre-
sentative Alex Tom, Gomez dis-
tributed applications and free cook-
ies to interested students at the Price 
Center Plaza from 3-5 p.m. 

Despite the relatively small 
turnout, several students did stop 
by to discuss the role of the stu-
dent regent and the application 
process. By his own estimate, 
Gomez handed out over 100 stu-
dent regent applications during 
the afternoon. 

The student regent position is 
regarded by some as the top stu-
dent leadership position within the 

UC system. The post includes full 
voting rights as a UC regent and 
carries a one-year term. 

In order to be eligible for the 
position, students must be under-
graduate, professional or graduate 
students "in good standing" at one 
of the nine UC campuses. 

Applicants are required to com-
plete an application form, which is 
subsequently dispatched to either 
the Southern or Northern Regional 
Nominating Committees - de-
pending on where the applicant is 
enrolled.

"It is a computer room, and it is 
left open at times as people come 
and go. It could have been that some-
body forgot to lock the door," he 
added. 

According to police, the doors to 
Nierenberg Hall are locked after the 
building closes at night.

Hazardous 
Waste Has 
New Home 
ENaa: Dept. processed 
80 tons of radioactive 
substances last year 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD's new $3.2 mi\ljon Envi-
ronmental Management Facility 
(EMF), located at the Campus Ser-
vices Complex in the far northeast 
corner of campus, will begin ac-
cepting campus radioactive and 
chemical waste when it opens on 
Monday, Oct. 30. 

According to EMF Manager 
Clark Martin, the main UCSD cam-
pus, Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography and Thornton Hospital pro-
duced 125 tons of liquid chemical 
waste and 80 tons of dry radioactive 
waste in 1994. 

Dry waste consists mainly of 
gloves, bench liners, pipettes, test 
tubes and other instruments used to 
hold and manipulate radioactive iso-
topes; while liquid waste comes from 
pharmaceutical research and both 
organic and inorganic chemistry 
experiments, Martin added. 

UCSD has a license to store ra-
dioactive materials with up to 90-
day half-lives and to dispose of up to 
two curies of radioactive material 
into the sewer each year, UCSD 
Environmental Health & Safety 
(EH&S) Environmental Issues Man-
ager Larry Oberti said. 

Materials with longer half-lives 
will also be stored at the facility, 
pending off-campus disposal. 

The EMF will keep materials for 
up to 10 half-lives, and only 0.63 
curies were discharged into the sewer 
last year, Martin said. 

Martin also downplayed the haz-
ards of the radioactive waste at the 
facility .

developed a way to transform plant 
stems, shoots and otherwise non-
flowering tissue, into blossoms.

stem, an area referred to as the api-

flower, molecular signals triggerthe 
production of thousands of other 
genes, all of which produce differ-

Falk: A.S. Not Liable for Cbe's Actions 
COUNC,IL: Cafe must 
submit financial review 
by Nov. 15 deadline 
By Esther Y.oon 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Counci l voted last 
night to con tinu e its year-long 
oversight - involving account-
ability.liability and responsibility 
- of all four student co-op orga-
nizations, except the Che Cafe, 
which was approved on a condi-
tional, short- term basis. 

According to collect ive member 
Doug Cronyn, the Chc is currently 
undergoing a financial review in 
lieu of the audit relJuired by the 
Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoV). 

The MoV is the standing agree-
ment between the A.S" the Gradu-
ate. Student Association and the 

VCSD administration. 
The Chc's failure to submit an 

audit by the end of October - the 
MoV 's stated deadline - is in step 
with the A .S. Co-op Oversight 
Committee's recommendation to 
substitute a less-costly financial re-
view and business plan instead of 
the audit, which costs an estimated 
$3,000. 

If the Che Cafe submits the re-
view by the Oversight Committee's 
Nov. 15 deadline, the A.S. will vote 
again to renew its relationship with 
the Che through Oct, I , 1996 - the 
approval date set for Groundwork 
Books, the Food Co-op and the Gen-
eral Store Co-op. 

Concernelabout the A .S. 's pos-
sible liability if the Che does not 
meet the guidelines set by the MoV, 
several council members expressed 
opposition to the Oversight 
Committee's recommendation. 

Paul DeWine,administrativerep-
resentative to A.S., announced that 
the A.S. has legal liability for the 
Che Cafe, if the student -run estab-
lishment disregards the MoV. 

However, A.S. President Naomi 
Falk disagreed. After consulting 
with Irvine-based lawyer John 
Francis, attorney for the A.S., Falk 
said the A.S. has ntlliability for the 
Chc's actions. 

" [Francis) told me that if the 
Chc did not submit the audit, then 
the Che is in viola tion of the MoV 
- not the A.S.," Falk said. U As 
long as the A.S. follows the proce-
dures set in the MoU, then we do 
not open ourselves up to further 
liability . "

Ubr.y Walk: Be C.eful 
What You Ask For ••• 

Last spring, students protested the construction of the 
Library Walk for political reasons. Complaints were made that 
not enough student input was sought, that too many trees were 
being killed and that the administration should find something 
else to do with its discretionary funds, rather than purchase a 
huge slab of cement which - for the most part - already 
existed. 

But now that we have a striped, alien landing pad adorn-
ing the center of our campus, last year's political com-
plaints have evolved into far more serious contemplation 
about the aesthetics of - or lack thereof - the walkway. 
This year, the protests have changed from "$2.5 million? 
Couldn ' t we have used that money to pay our fees?" to the 
more intellectual debate of "Can someone explain the 
stripes?" and "What are those big white balls by Center 
Hall?" 

Although students may be disappointed with the final 
version of the Library Walk, we should be relieved that the 
administration did not spend an additional amount of money. 
After all, the university saved funds which can be used for 
more worthwhile outlets, such as lowering fees or creating 
scholarships. 

So last year, amid student protest, the administration asked 
the construction company in charge of the Library Walk to 
downgrade it considerably. Several features induded in 
UCSD's original Master Plan - such as fountains - were 
axed due to their expensive cost. 

We can ' t expect to have a beautiful walkway, when we 
protested the construction - and amount of funding - of the 
Library Walk in the first place. In short, we can't have our 
cake and eat it too: It 's our fault we have a space runway 
gracing our campus. 

Freeze on Student Fees 
Finally a Possibility • 

At last Thursday's UC Board of Regents meeting, Lt. Gov. 
Gray Davis threatened a ballot initiative which would freeze 
UC student fees for the next three years. Davis' plan would 
also limit fee increases for the next five years to the growth 
rate of personal and family incomes. 

Calling the ongoing fee hikes "essentially taxes on the 
middle class," he noted that California families took out nearly 
$1.7 billion in federal student loans in 1993-94 alone. 

Whether paid by loans, scholarships, jobs or some combina-
tion of the three, the cost of a UC education has risen nearly 
300 percent over the last 10 years. Davis is to be commended 
for his efforts to prevent the exclusion of all but the rich from 
the UC system. 

UC budget planners anticipate a $40.3 million shortfall 
during the next fiscal year. While the university must some-
how make up for this shortfall, raising student fees is not the 
answer. It never has been. 

What Atkinson and the money-grubbing regents who 
supported the fee increase fail to realize is that today's UC 
students will be tomorrow's doctors, engineers, lawyers and 
politicians. America will be stabbing itself in the back if it 
allows even one of those future leaders to drop out of school 
because he could not afford to pay $20,000 per year for an 
education at what used to be one of the finest public universi-
ties in the world. 

Thumbs Down to the 
UCSD Student Body ... 

.. .for not s~aking with Student Regent Ed Gomez while he 
was at UCSD on Tuesday. Students are continually complain-
ing that no one represents them on the UC Board of Regents, 
yet are unwilling to talk with the one regent who consistently 
supports stud~nt interests. Only one student can be com-
mended for his efforts Tuesday - Gomez himself.

SAnHE: With all the napping, chatting and doodling that goes on 
during an average UCSD lecture, how much do we actually learn? 

Derek

The Voice of 

Reason 

With so many lectures and 
so many sections, an entire 
quarter at UCSD can easily 
fade into a single, blurred 
memory. And once it's over, 
it's often difficullto look back 
at any single lecture or remem-
ber any specific event that 
transpired over the 10-week 
period. Thus, to truly appreci-
ate our educational experience 
and fully acknowledge the pro-
fessors ' ef-
forts, as well 
as the stu-
dents' sweat 

and hard work, let us take a moment 
to reminisce. Let us examine an hour 
in the life of a UCSD lecture ... 
8:57 a.m. 

begin the lecture. He raises his arms and gestures 
for the large class to be seated. Only about six people 
see him, and they're the ones who are already sit-
ting down. The rest of the class remains standing, 
ignoring his pleas. 
9:03 a.m. 

The professor tries once again to start class, but with 
the same sorry results. This time - to bide his embar-
rassment - he begins chatting with a student in the 
front row, as if to suggest that he wasn't really ready 
for class in the first place. 
9:05 a.m. 

Success! Once the students begin 
to settle down in their seats, the pro-
fessor uses his most audible voice to 
grab their attention. A quiet, but an-
noying, smattering of student voices 
accompanies the first minute of lec-
ture. 
9:07 a.m. 

1 arrive three minutes early and 
secure a nice, comfy seat near the 
front of the classroom. Checking the 
door, I realize that the professor 
basn't shown up yet, thus affording 
me a few precious minutes of extra 
sleep. 
8:59 a.m. 

Alas, just as I put my bead back, 
the professor makes his entrance and 
immediately begins writing an out-
line on the board - no sleep for me. 
As I busily copy down the day's 
scheduled material, a group of 
clumsy students sits right behind me, 
slamming numerous book bags into 
my head in the process. After secur-
ing his seat, the guy directly behind 
me immediately shoves his feet into 
the back of my chair, sending me

With the professor just into his 
outline, the last of the stragglers file 
into the lecture ball . Most grab seats 
in the back, trying in vain to be quiet 
while moving around books, bags 
and pens in an otherwise silent room. 
9:10 a.m. 

An even tardier straggler arrives, 
yelling out the door to bis buddy, com-
pletely oblivious to the fact that his 
"outside" voice is far too loud for the 
inside of a lecture hall. Luckily for me, 
he chooses a seat in my aisle - right 
in the middle of the room, so as to in-
terrupt and distract as many people as 
possible. He wades and dances through 
the aisle, tripping on backpacks and 
feet as be makes his way to the one 
empty seat.

of me. 
9:00 a.m. 

Just as I adjust to the people behind me, 1 get sand-
wiched on both sides by two more late entries. I now 
have almost no space to move or stretch, let alone take 
notes. With each subtle shift, I violently strike approxi-
mately three people on all sides. 
9:02 a.m. 

The professor makes his first futile attempt to

Finally, the classroom settles down for real. As the 

lecture drags on, the girl to my left starts nodding off, 
her bead dropping slowly toward her notebook with 
each breath. 
9:23 a,m. 

A disheveled student in the back row goes the whole 
nine yards. Completely sprawled out in his seat- and 
in parts of other seats nearby - he begins snoring, 
thus providing the surrounding students with entertain-

The UCSD Guardian OPINION S 

COMMENTARY: The problem with editorials and opinion columns is not simply what 
they're saying, but rather that the general public actually believes what they're saying 

MODERATION HELPS MAKE UP OUR MINDS 
By Wayne Wone 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Opinions - they're every-
where. They pervade morning pa-
pers, afternoon talk shows and the 
evening news. Everybody has 
them, and everybody wants to ex-
press them, and there is nothing 
wrong with that. But have you 
ever stopped to consider whose 
opinions are getting through to 
you and, perhaps more impor-
tantly, whose are not? How is it 
decided which quotes are printed, 
which celebrities are interviewed 
and which polls are conducted? 
Why, for example, was this com-
mentary allowed to be published? 

The answer is that most of the 
events and ideas which are aired, 
published or publicized are interest-
ing - or, at the very least, atten-
tion grabbing. (Of course, you may 
disagree after reading this article.) 
News directors don't want to fill 
their 30 minutes of air time with 
boring, everyday events. Think how 
ridiculous it would be for a news-
caster to say, "Just in - 200 mil-
lion Americans went to work IOday" 
or " ... the most recent farm ing report 
indicates that all the crops are do-
ing just fine." 

The public wants to know 
about murders and assaults, wars 
and famines, and the occasional 

political scandal. As I see it, this 
desire to know is not the problem. 
The problem is that most people 
don't realize these events are ex-
ceptional, and that - in general 
- everything else is fine. This 
causes people to think things are 
worse - or better, in some cases 
- than they actually are. And, as 
any two-bit psychologist would 
tell you, such a deviant perception 
of the world is unhealthy. 

The most recent example of this 
is the OJ. Simpson murder trial. Ac-
cusations and commentaries were 
voiced about the criminal justice 
system, the LAPD, the FBI and ev-
ery other acronym which partici-
pated in the media circus. There 
were stories about stories, and edi-
torials about editorials. Many 
people used this inarguably excep-
tional case to validate their griev-
ances agai~st whatever establish-
ment they felt like crucifying at the 
time. 

But such an unusual case can-
not be used to criticize the every-
day operation of something as 
large as the American judicial sys-
tem. I belie\'e the courts are much 
more efficient than the Simpson 
trial pQrtrayed. If every trial were 
as laced with such contrived melo-
drama and absurd financial cir-
cumstances, we 'd all be in a lot of 

N.wspapers and 
t.levlslon

Ideals such as 
responsibility or 
morality - they

trouble. 

Now, the question is: Who is 
to blame for this incongruity be-

tween what you ' re seeing in the 
media and what's really happen-
ing? Despite the risk of unpopu-
larity and ostracism, I pin the 
blame on none other than - drum 
roll, please - you. 

Yes, you. 
Don 't be so shocked. Despite 

what you may think, the media 
only gives you what you want . 
Newspapers and television sta-
tions don't peddle their merchan-
dise based on vague ideals such as 
responsibility or morality - they 
sell them because of you. You are 
the customer, and the customer is 
always right. 

And as long as we are assigning 
blame, let 's assign a little to the 
news-makers themselves, most of-
ten politicians and celebrities. These 
people often feel compelled to make 
extreme and inflammatory state-
ments - which they mayor may 
not believe - just to get your at-
tention. In this era of sound biles and 
short attention spans, nothing less 
works. 

Most politicians work under 
the omnipotent guidance of polls, 
which tell them exactly what the 
public wants. And this brings us 
to another serious problem. As 
anyone who has participated in a 
"scientific" survey can tell you, 
the questions asked are too often 

black-and-white: Yes or no? Right 
or wrong? Left or righe Surveys 
simply don 't take into lonsider-
ation the many shades of gray and 
can therefore lead to misleading 
results. This is one rea~o n why 
studies and polls can be u~cd 10 
prove anything. 

A recent example of misu sed 
statistical data involved the much-
talked-about Million Man March. 
Louis Farrakhan, the event orga-
nizer and Nation of Islam leader, 
used the U.S. Park Service 's un-
derestimation of the event 's atten-
dance to substantiate his claims of 
racism within the agency - and 
he may soon file a lawsuit. 

The validity of Farrakhan 's ac-
cusation flounders , however, 
when one hears that both the U.S. 
Park Service and researchers at 
Boston University agree that the 
undercount most likely resulted 
from a lack of adequate technol-
ogy. 

So, what do you get when you 
mix black-and-white questions, 
self-serving politicillns and a 
semi-permeable media? One big, 
toxic spill of misinformation and 
opinion. 

As a result, a startling' trend of 
polarization has emerged in this 
country. A group of people -

I begin looking around the room just to 
do a tally of how many people are asleep 
- only about three - but I discover far 
more students who are engaged in equally 
unconstructive activities. The person in 
front of me is fully engrossed in an elabo-

bizarre bug.

Three girls just a few rows behind me have 
apparently forgotten that they're in a lecture. 
They are busily carrying on an intense con-

take the time to solidify their own belief sys-
tems without submitting to the pressure of the 
extremes, or to random news polls, they would 
find a lot to be gained by moving away from 
the sides of the pool and treading the waters

The professor senses that he is losing the 
battle. He raises his voice accordingly, but this 
only encourages the students to match him 
every step of the way. 
9:48 a.m. 

In a last, desperate attempt to squeeze 
in more information, the professor acciden-
tally utters the suicidal phrase: "Next 
time ... " With that, all hell breaks loose. The 
entire room erupts into a sea of people 
standing, yelling, waking up and ' running 
out the doors. Perhaps they have another 
lecture to sleep through. 
9:48 a.m. 

The lecture is still officially in progress, and 
the professor hasn't given up. With no more than 
five students still sitting down, he asks if there 
arc any questions, signaling to four of them that 
the lecture is indeed over. But a lone student 
actually wants to ask something, and he and the 
professor discuss the material over the cacopho-
nous exodus of the others. 
9:49 a.m. 

Closing my notebook, I too file out of the 
classroom. Another lecture is done. Another 
hour 's worth of information is eagerly ab-
sorbed by UCSD students. 

This is not to say, however, that we should 
compromise our beliefs. If you vehemently 
believe that abortion is wrong, then sta y true 
to your beliefs - just make sure it is you who 
believes it. 

Also, don 't confuse moderation with me-
diocrity. Moderation is judicious; mediocrity 
is lazy. Within moderation there is room for 
creative thinking and a spirited pursuit of 
ideas, which represent the antithesis of medi-
ocrity. 

So, read the newspapers, watch the 
evening news and listen to the barrage of opin-
ions thrown at you every day. But in the end, 
make up your own mind.

California Space Institute - which 
shares the research area in

she entered the computer room 
Monday morning, she noticed chairs 
strewn around and a wire yanked

"We've had wallets and back-

Police said they currently have

We're still looking around, trying to 
contact some more people over in

tum on flowering, basically, at will," 
he added, 

The aspen tree, for example, can 
take anywhere from eight to 20 years 
before it will flower, reaching a 
height of 30 feel. A young aspen 
equipped with one of the perma-
nently "on" flowering genes, how-
ever, will flower at six months, when 
it is a mere two-inches tall. 

According to researchers, the 
findings could have significant ag-
ricultural benefits, especially in ar-
eas where hybrid plants are cur-
rently being developed. 

Early flowering could potentially 
present growers with a viable 
method of introducing new genetic 
traits - such as pesticide resistance 
- into seeds, 

Researchers are still trying to 
determine how the specific flower-
ing genes operate in relation to the 
thousands of other genes and flow-
ering mechanisms also present in 
the plant. 

Ideally, the same genes isolated in 
Arabidopsis will someday be success-
fully transplanted into any plant spe-
cies, giving fanners the opportunity 
to increase crop yield, or horticultur-
ists the ability to produce signifieantly 
greater amounts of flowers,

GOMEZ: 
Regent listens to 
student concerns 
Continued from pal. 1 

The nominating committees se-
lect nine semi-finalists, from whom 
the UeSA Board of Directors 
chooses thret fi nalists. The Board 
of Regents then appoints one of the 
three as the next Student Regent at 
its February meeting. 

UCSD A.S. President Naomi 
Falk was one of last year's finalists 
for the student regent position. 

The student regent is reimbursed 
for expenses incurred while attend-
ing the monthly meetings, and he 
has all mandatory university fees 

and tuition waived during his ten-
ure. 

During his time as student re-
gent, Gomez has opposed initia-
tives to repeal affirmative-action 
policies and raise student fees. In 
addition, Gomez recently intro-
duced a bill which calls for the UC 
regents to re-open the affirmative-
action debate. 

According to Dowd, "[Gomez] 
travels constantly around the ue 
campuses, talking to the students 
and receiving their input on the is-
sues." 

Gomez said the most important 
issue currently facing the Board of 
Regents is the group's overall "lack 
of understanding of what it means to 
be a student in 1995."

Martin added that the drums or

to block any radiation from being 
emitted into the environment. 

Tbunday, October 26, 1995

then it will be buried in the Miramar

various wastes from the main campus, SIO and Thornton Hospital. 

Liquid radioactive waste will be 
stored in stainless-stul tanks until it 
decays to background levels - at 
which time it, will be deposited into 
the sewer. 

Non-radioactive liquid waste 
will be "Iabpacked" - sealing the

Ion drums - or poured into single 
drums, if the chemicals are com-

posal. 

Although Oberti said the mate-
rials stored in the building will not 
be especially dangerous, the facil-
ity has multiple safeguards - in-
cluding 55-gallon sumps at the 
entrance of every room and a 
12,OOO-galion holding tank - in 
case of accidents.

he said. 

Martin maintained that the EMF 
has a safety-conscious design. "We 
tried to build as many safety devices 
as we could," he said.

The building sits on a concrete

layers of epoxy sealant. The pipes 
from the building to the holding 
tank are double-contained, labora-

continuously for leaks. 

"There were no corners cut on 
anything below the surface .of the

Northern Irish Band 
Steers Clear of Politics 
Schtum makes its San Diego 

debut at Price Center on Friday 
By Jeff NI ... I 
Hiatus Editor 

The political unrest in Northern 
Ireland has received so much press 
coverage that the first question asked 
ofSchtum singer-guitar-
ist Christian McNeill al-
most always concerns 
his political views. 

During a recent 
phone interview, 
McNeill , whose band 
performs on Friday in the 
Price Center plaza, spoke 
from his home in Derry, 
Ireland about his desire 
to be recognized as a mu-
sician and not a diplomat. 

"Because we're from Northern 
Ireland, we're always asked about 
politics. People ask, 'Do you live 
anywhere near the war?'" McNeill 
said. "We' re just sick of that be-
cause we're in a band. People say 
we are lying when we say we're not 
political. I suppose we are quietly 
political. We don 't make it our cru-
sade like Dolores has done with the 
Cra·nberries. We would never do a 
song like 'Zombie. ' That's what 
we 're against. Bono seems to have a 
knack for it, but I wouldn't run across 

the stage with a flag." 
McNeill may shy away from 

making overt political statements, 
but the songs on the band's U.S. 
debut, Grow, reflect a distinctly 

apocalyptic vision, par-
ticularly in the track 
"Millenium. " 

"So many people sing 
songs about [the end of 
the world]. We tried to 
approach it in a different 
way - without being 
pretentious. Our lyricS 
are not necessarily de-
pressing. It depends on 
what the individual takes 

from them. There's also some more 
positive songs on the album," 
McNeill said. 

Started three years ago by 
McNeill, guitarist Ivan Birthistle, 
bassist James Cunning/lam and 
drummer Rory McCarron, Schtum 
(the name is Yiddish for "quiet" or 
"secret") released its first EP, Dig-
ging Holes, on its own label in 1994. 
Since then, the Irish punk scene has 
taken off; but McNeil, who cited the 
Velvet Underground, Fugazi and 
Iggy Pop among his influences, said 
he doesn' t consider Schtum part of

anyone music scene. 
"There's been a bit of an 1xplo-

sion, where bands like Ash and Joy-
rider have been signed up to major 
labels. But allth<fse bands have been 
linked to scenes which we're not 
part of. They are part of the whole 
pop-punk scene that has become so 
retro-cnol.lt's all so watered down," 
he said: 

"I think the music scene in 
America is much healthier because 
there isn't so much cynicism and 
emphasis on fashion, like there is 
the U.K., where the Brit-pop scene 

isone fashion layout. All those bands 
suck. They ' re fucking awful," he 
added. 

McNeill said thattraditionallrish 
music has not made much of an 
impact on his musical career. It was 
when he first saw the Beatles as a 
child that he knew he wanted to be 
in a band. 

"I can remember when) was 10 
years old, wearing these Beatles' 
badges because I just discovered 
their album Revolver. I had a John 
Lennon haircut.) remember the first 
time) heard 'She Said, She Said,' I 

knew I wanted to be in a band," he 
said, also citing the Rolling Stones 
and Elvis as early influences. 

Schtum plans to tour the U.S., 
starting its trip tonight in Phoenix, 
AZ. McNeill said the band has al-
ready begun writing material for 
another album and will play some of 
the new songs during its live sets. 
McNeill said it's important fo r the 
band to put out another album 
quickly . 

Schtum will play with Jambay 
and Bootsy Collins on Friday at 7 
p.m. at the Price Center plaza .

Hungry Hearts Search 
For American Dream 

Sam Shepard's 'Curse of the Staroing Class' 
opens UCSD Theatre Department season 

By Michael Schwartz 
Staff Writer 

"Curse of the Starving Class"-
Sam Shepard's 1978 play about a 
family experiencing the dark side of 
the American dream -
will open UCSD's the-
ater season on Wednes-
day at the Mandell Weiss 
Forum. 

In 1971, Shepard 
said: "I don't want to be 
a playwright, I want to 
be a rock 'n' roll star." 
Although he never ac-
complished this goal, he 
has fou nd a career as a 
film actor, appearing in Crimes of lhe 
Hearr and The Pelican Brief. 

Despite his motion picture suc-
cess, he remains one of America's 
best playwrights. Shepard is prone to 

brag that he writes his plays in one 
swoop, never taking time to rewrite or 
rethink. While many of his plays ar-
guably prove this poor writing strat-
egy, the misses are easily eclipsed by 

the raw, explosive power 
of his best works. 

Often juxtaposing 
humor and pathos, gritty 
reality and poetic child-
hood dreams, "Curses" 
follows the activities of a 
family which refuses to 
believe it is part of the 
starving class. 

A flipside to the ste-
reotypical Brady Bunch 

kids, the main characters Wesley and 
Emma are children who know dys-
function from firsthand experiences: 
Brothers who urinate on important 
school work, and a molher who fries

up science projects for dinner. The 
family is not hopelessly poor; they 
starve for a satisfying place in society 
and a sense of self worth rather than 
food. 

"I have an interest in plays that 
show people have a potential to care 
for each other in meaningful ways, 
but circumstances do not allow it," 
said production director Stephanie 
French. "America doesn't really deal 
with poverty and disintegration ... We 
pretend it isn't right under our noses." 

Shepard, who grew up in a small 
town near Los Angeles, includes fron-
tier themes in his work. These themes 
appeal to French, who said the play is 
"a critique of eatinltUP the possibility 
of a frontier by paving it over." 

"Curse of the Starving Class" runs 
through Nov. 4. For more informa-
tion, call 523-4574.

Murder by the Numbers 
Jon Amiels latest film, Copycat, 
parodies the serial killer genre 

By Jeff N ..... 
Hiatus Editor 

The killer in Jon Amiel's new 
film, Copycat, takes serial killing 
to the level of a sick parody, as he 
commits acts which imitate those 
by other serial killers. The crimes 
he commits replicate - to the pre-
cise detail - the deeds of well-
known murderers like Jeffrey 
Dahmer and Henry Lee Lucas. 

In fact, the mysterious killer is 
so meticulous, he makes sure that 
his victims are killed in precisely 
thesamemannerandunderthesame 
circumstan es as those killed by 
the origi nal criminals. This premise 
makes for a decent enough thriller, 
even if the film itself copies other 
serial killer faire, most notably Si-
lence of the Lambs. 

COUrtlsy of Melissa Mosley 
Rudy to fire: Detective M.J . Monahan (Holly Huter) searches 
for an intelligent serial killer in Co~at. 

In the film 's opening 
scene, Dary II Lee 
Cullum (Harry Connick, 
Jr., in a surprising role) 
tries to strangle Dr. 
Helen Hudson (Sig-
ourney Weaver) after 
she testifies against him 
in court. Helen is saved 
but ends up agorapho-
bic, unable to even leave

The casting of the film concerns Helen 's e-mail 
Weaver and Hunter as correspondence with the killer (who 
the main investigators sends untraceable messages), but

paper. 

also echoes Silence of this comes off as nothing more than

The view from the top: Patrons look down at a band at 
Croce's Jazz Bar in downtown San Diego. 

Gaslamp Jazz 
Croces offers hot music 

By Jam_Kan. 
Guardian Reporter 

Nightly live jazz is the best, and 
perhaps the only, thing Croce's Jazz 
Bar has to offer. The great music will 
make you want to stay, 
even though this Gaslamp 
District venue has over-
priced beer and yuppies 
spiling out of every door 
and window. 

Named after the late 
folk singer Jim Croce, 
Croce's Jazz Barisoneof 
several clubs along Fifth 
Avenue owned by his 
widow, Ingrid. The other 
establishments include: Croce's Res-
taurant and Jazz Bar, Croce's Top 
Hat BarandGrille, Upstairs at Croce's 
and Ingrid's Catina and Sidewalk 

Cafe. In addition, Horton Plaza, of-
fers Croce's Coffee House. • 

Although Jim and Ingrid origi-
nally settled in rural Pennsylvania to 
focus on domestic life, little home-

town charm has made it 
into Croce's Jazz Bar. 
The wine and bourbon 
lists, the pricey drinks 
(beers are $3-7) and the 
white-collarclienteleare 
the marks of an upper-

Green Day 

Insomniac 
-• Warner Bro •• 

Singer-guitarist Billie Joe and 
Green Day return after a brief record-
ing-studio absence with Insomniac, a 
fast-paced collection of punk melo-
dies which starts exactly where the 
band's '94mulli-platinum hitDoo.tie 
left off. Considering that the band was 
touring for a large portion of the time, 
it comes as no surprise that very little 
has changed since Dookie hit the 
stores. If anything, the songs have 
become even more frantic, with most 
tracks played at such a fast pace that 
only three cuts break the three-minute 
barrier. 

The band's sound remains largely 
unchanged: It is still tight, clean and 
filled with Billie Joe 's catchy, repeti-
tive, hook-laden lyrics. Although the 
recordings are noticeably cleaner, the 
guitar chord progressions have re-
mained virtually unchanged from 
those on early releases like Kerplunk! 
Tn! Cool provides the same steady 
drumming -along with Mike Dirt's 
solid bass playing - to complete 
Green Day's familiar sound. Consis-
tency may well prove to be its greatest 
asset, much like it was for the 
Ramones.

wasn 't spectacular, but we were 
ready and we played out -the game," 
Muchowski said. 

"We had plenty of opportunities, 
and we could have knocked a few 
more in," Ele Johnson said. ~But we 
came out intense and menially ready, 
which is what we need for the next 
two [games)." 

Those next two games are against 
Division II foes CSU Dominguez 
Hillsand CSU San Bernardino. Both 
are familiar Triton opponents, infa-
mous for their bruising style. The 
matches are essential for the Tri -
tons, who hope that winning both 
wi ll keep them out of a preli minary-
round playoff game. 

"We were flat today, compared 
to Saturday [a 5-0 triumph over 
ucsq, but we' re an up and down 
team," UCSD Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. "We always man-
age to get up for the big games." 

DON: Boxing's 
King in trouble again 
Continued from pal. 20 

That 's right folks, King has a 
kid, and he will be in charge of 
Dad's business should the fat man 
be jailed. Junior has already replaced 
Pop in the promotions for the up-
coming Tyson-Mathis fight. 

The only difference between the 
two King 's is the lackofhairon Don 
Jr. 's head. But he has the same swag-
ger, arrogance and demeanor of 
Pappa - qualities that lead him to 
say of every fight , "This is the fight 
of the century .. . really." 

Knowing Don Sr., however, we 
won ' t have to concern ourselves 
with this possibility. The outcome 
of a King trial is as easy to predict as 
the weather here in San Diego. He 
has purchased the best lawyer money 
can buy, and he will likely be found 
innocent and leave court with that 
famous smirk on his face.

TIgers Bite Tritons From Behind 
CLAWED: UCSD dropped a five-set 
heartbreaker at home to Occidental 
College, after leading, 2-0 early on 
By De .. Kratt 
Spotts Editor 

On Wednesday night, the UCSD 
women's volleyball team's season 
was painfully encapsulated in a 

single match against 
Occidental. 

The Tigers came 
in with a one-di-
mensional attack. 
Granted, itwasabig 
dimension: 6'2" 
Mia Solmssen. 

by Biesheuvel and a 
service winner by 
Madelyn Ripken put 
UCSD up, 11-6. 

After a brief lull, 
theTritonsclosedout 
the contest on four 
consecutive points. 
The game was 
clinched when fresh-
man Shannon 
Noonan rose up and 
single-handedly re-
jected a Solmssen 
spike attempt, giving 
UCSD its 15th point 

Ranked fourth in 
the West Region and hungry for an 
upset, Occi went to Solmssen early 
and often. However, in the open-
ing games of the match, the Tritons 
seemed to have figured her out. 

Solmssen started quickly in the 
first game, before UCSD's strat-
egy - pitting a single middle 
blocker against her to look for the 
digs - began to neutralize her. 
With Solmssen on the back burner, 
Ihe Tritons went to work. 

Just when things 
looked brightest, 
however, the Tritons 
began to crumble. A 
quick start in game 

Killer: UCSO's Christil)e Chi (right) goes up 
for a spike during the loss to Occidental. 

A game which was close in the 
iate going quickly swung UCSD's 
way, when Mieke Biesheuvel (16 
kills, 22 digs) stepped to the ser-
vice line and sent four consecu· 
tive, dipping, jump serves over the 
net. Two were aces and the others 
became quick Triton points, stak· 
ing UCSD to a 14-9 advantage. 
Foursideouts later, the Tritons cap-
tured a 15·9, opening.game win. 

Game two saw more of the same, 
as the combatants hung close until 
the late going - when UCSD as-
serted itself. A cross-court smoker 

three quickly deteriorated into a 
10-3 deficit, as the Tiger offense 
hit its stride just when the UCSD 
spikers seemed unable to put the 
crucial balls away. 

The Tritons made a valiant 
comeback late in game three- in 
an attempt to put the match away. 
Another strong series of serves by 
Biesheuvel helped UCSD notch 
five stra ight points. That streak tied 
the score at 12, but the Tigers rose 
to the occasion, picking up the final 
three points to win it, 15-12. 

Game four seemed hopeful at 
the outset, when UCSD leapt to a 7-
3 cushion, but Occidental stormed 
back to take the lead 11-9. Four 
meekly contested points later, the 
Tigers had forced a fifth game. 

The Tritons continued their 
quick-start tradition in game five, 
but missed precious opportunites 
to extend their lead. A 6·4 UCSD 
advantage vanished under the 
weight of the Tigers building mo-
mentum, and no amount of frus-
trated yelling by UCSD Head Coach 
Doug Dannevik seemed capable of 
turning the tide. 

Occidental captured game five, 
15-9, and left the gym jubilant. It 
was a stark contrast to the Tritons, 
for whom this defeat epitomized a 
season in which far more games 
have been given away than lost. 

"We are our own worst enemy, 
that'sforsure," Danneviksaid. "We 
are capable of playing beller and 
we certainly have to."

Rugby 
The sight of falling leaves can 

mean only one thing: It's time to 
play rugby. 

The UCSD rugby 
team opened its season 

Oct. 21 at the annual 
Escondido 1 D's tour· 
nament. Tradition-

ally attended by much more experi-
enced men's club teams, it was a 
real test for the San Diego squad. 

UCSD opened up pool play 
against Camp Pendelton. Using its 
speed and stamina, UCSD cruised 
to a 15-3 victory over the veteran 
Marine squad. 

UCSD's second contest pitted it 
against the scrappy Oxy Olde boys. 
UCSD pulled out a tough, 7-5 
squeaker, remaining undefeated in 
po<?l play. 

San Diego improved its pool-
play record to 3-0 with a 31-7 drub-
bing of the home team from 
Escondido. With this triumph, 
UCSD earned a spot in the semifi· 
nals against the same Escondido 
team. 

UCSD came up victorious once 
again, this time defeating the hosts 
by a 28-17 tally. Oxy Olde Boys 
posed the final hurdle for UCSD's 
perfect championship run, but 
UCSD came out strong in the first 
half, putting up 19 unanswered 
points to take a commanding lead 
into halftime. 

The second half was more of the 
same, as the San Diegans tallied 22 
more points, cruising to a 41-0 vic-
tory and earning the righl to be hailed 
as the Escondido 10's tournament 
champions. 

"Starting the season undefeated 
sets the tone for the entire year," 
UCSD junior Troy Meyer said. 

Fifth-year senior Devon Shea 
spearheaded the UCSD effort by 
scoring 31 points in the tourney. 
Paul Conley, Chigo Uzutowe and 
Joe Lange each notched 15 points. 

Next up for UCSD will be a show-

Club squad at Warren West Field 
this Saturday at 1 p.m.

Don Juan de 
Boxing 

Being the official boxing 
expert at the Guardian, I feel it 
my duty to inform you .- the 
clueless public - of the latest 
goings-on in this fine sport. 

Those unfortunate few who 
claim to have almost finished 
one of my previous columns 
are well aware of my tendency 
to digress ... repeatedly. So, I 
will try to focus my attention 
on the boxing world and the 
man who runs it: Don King. 
The man with "tbe hair" has 
elevated himself to the status 
of Zeus, controlling everything 
from fight promotions to 
individl,lal boxers, as well as 
managing organizations. 

Now it would be easy for 
me to ramble on about his 
funky hair, or how he looks 
like the female orangutan at

gut feelings tell me to avoid 
this easy route. Actually, . 
someone wrote an article about 
his hair last year, so ... 

Sky shot: UCSD's Diana Muchowski (3) outleaps a trio of Occidental defenders to put a header on goal during the Tritons' 5-0 victory. 

On to my real analysis: 
King currently faces wire-
fraud charges in New York, 
putting him in jeopardy of 
spending 45 years in prison, if 
found guilty. (Note to reader: I 
will not draw any parallels to 
that other recent legal case, so 
forget about it.) 

Tritons Strip Tigers' Stripes 
OFFENSIVE: UCSD continued its goal-scoring tear by smashing rival Occidental, 5-0, on Monday 

By Grea Wrenn 
Contributing Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's soccer team 
erased any doubts about its readi-
ness for postseason play by blowing 

Kramer tallied her second score 
of the game with 20:45 to play in the 
half. Again, she was in the right 
place at the right time, 12 yards 
from the goal, when the ball bounced 
off her and a Ti-

able to muster even one shot after 
the intermission, and the Tritons 
managed only one goal. But it was a 
more physical half, with the Tigers 
intent on getting back into the game This is not the first time 

Donald has come upon legal 
problems. Prior to this latest 
annoyance, he was acquitted of 
murder and sev."raJ other 
charges. King has made a 

away visiting Occi-
dental College, 5-0, 
on Monday after-
noon. The win was 
the Tritons' third 
consecutive shutout, 
during which time 
UCSD hasoutscored 
its opponents, 18-0. 

at the 12:12 mark, when UCSD's 
Ele Johnson found herself with the 
ball in front of the Occi goal. Johnson 
was challenged by goalkeeper 
Melanie Bocianowski, but the Tiger 
was too late to prevent Johnson from 
dishing back to teammate Kelly 
Kramer. Kramer's bullet shot rose 
quickly and beat Bocianowski high, 
giving UCSD a 1-0 lead. 

ger defender and Scorlnl Summary: 

living by blaming his associ-
ales and copping the plea, "I 
don't knot..: anything about the 
day-to-day operations of Don 
King Productions." 

It's interesting to note that 
after his acquittal for murder 
several years back, members 
of the jury were seen frolick-
ing in Europe - at King's 
expense. And no one knows 
how many other luxuries he 
threw at the 12 jurors who 
granted him his freedom. 

However, this recent 
chapter iD Donald's question-
able legal history seems to 
promise a change. The 
prosecution has several 
witnesses who will testify that 
King defrauded Lloyd's of 
London by submitting phony 
expenses aDd a fake contract 
from a canceled fight last year. 

Although the Tigers came out 
fired up and the home team looked 
somewhat Oat, the contest was never 
in doubt. The Tritons broke through 

Unlike the past two games for 
the Tritons, the opposition was able 
to get some earl y offensive pressure 
going. Occidental's fastest player, 
Michelle Winscott, made a couple 
of runs on the UCSD goal, but the 
Triton defense was more than a 
match for her. 

out to UCSD's 
Amanda Johnson. 
Johnson then 
passed it right 
back to Kramer, 
who hammered a 
line-drive 
screamer inches inside the left post 
and just past the diving Bocianowski. 

The Tritons got an assist from 
the Tigers on their third goal, a cor-
ner kick with 7:12 to play before the 
half. Jodie Knott took the kick for 
UCSD and nailed a low cross that 
Occidental's Jessica Putnick tried 
to clear. Putnick missed, and the 
ball bounced off her and into the net 
for a 3-0 UCSD lead. 

Just a minute-and-a-half later, 
Triton Lisa Wilkinson took the ball 
up the right center of the field and 
drifted outwards as she reached the 
penalty box. She launched a rising 
shot from 15 yards out that Tiger 
defender Dawn Coodwin tried to 
head ' out by stepping forward, 
thereby screening Bocianowski from 
the play. But the shot whistled over 
Coodwin's left shoulder, and the 
keeper didn't see the ball until it 
bounced off the back of the net. 

What worries me is the 
horrible predicament we will 
be in, if he is found guilty. The 
next in line to replace Ki.ng is 
best known as Donald Jr.

- and the UCSD midfield and de-
fense just happy to hold them at bay. 

Not that the Tritons didn't have 
scoring opportunities - Kramer 
came close to notching a hat trick 
several times, making the goal box 
in front of Bocianowski her per-
sonal domain. Her attempts, how-
ever, missed just wide. 

UCSD finally collected its fifth 
score off its favorite offensive 
weapon, the cornet kick. With 3:42 
left in the contest, Kate Larsen lofted 
a perfect feed to teammate Diana 
Muchowski, who was camped in 
front of the Tiger goal. Muchowski 
used her height advantage to out-
leap two Tigers and head the ball 
into the center of the net, closing out 
the scoring. 

The stats reflected the Triton 
dominance, as the home team out-
shot Occidental, 18-3, and posted a 
15-1 advantage in comer kicks.
