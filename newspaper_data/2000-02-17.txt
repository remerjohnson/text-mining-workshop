MOSCOW - In a sign of his 
desire to cultivate closer ties with 
the West, Acting President 
Vladimir Putin agreed Wednesday 
to end an ll-month estrangement 
between Russia and NATO and 
rebuild what the Kremlin called an 
alliance aimed at "a stable and 
indivisible Europe." 

The thaw was announced after 
a meeting between Putin and 
NATO's secretary-general, 
George Robertson. Formally, at 
least, it closes a cavernous divide 
that opened last March after 
NATO launched its air war

Wallet Thefts on the Rise 
emIlE: Police also report'vandalism to dance studio and shuttle bus 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Stllf' Writer 

Eight wallets have been 
reported stolen from UCSD 
locations since Jan. 21, marking 
a recent increase in wallet 
thefts, according to a communi-
ty safety alert released by 
UCSD Police Wednesday. The 
Police Department also report-
ed vandalisrns involving high 
amounts of damage last We6. 

Each reported wallet theft 
occurred during normal UCSD 
business hours. In each case, 
the offender or offenders 

entered an unlocked or unat-
tended office or laboratory and 
removed the wallets from a 
purse or backpack. There is no 
information regarding potential 
suspects for the recent thefts. 

The Feb. 10 vandalism dam-
aged windows of the dance stu-
dio facility and a shuttle bus. 
Damage to the dance studio is 
estimated at $5,000. Damages to 
the shuttle bus are estimated at 
$500. 

Douglas O'Dell, a UCSD 
Police Department detective, 
said one dance studio window 
was shattered and at least one 

additional window had holes. 
O'Dell said the damage proba-
bly occurred between 12:15 
a.m. and 12:50 a.m. last Friday 

Hours before damage was 
reported at the dance studio, a 
shuttle bus driver reported hear-
ing a noise from the side of the 
bus he was driving on Scholars 
Drive near the Ole Cafe late last

the bus' window and was report-

Movement 
Kicked Out 
of Plaza 
DECISION: 10,000 
people tried to attend 
Price Center event 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

In the wake of Movement 
2000, Tom Tucker, assistant vice 
chancellor of student affairs, is 
restricting the location of large 
events, particularly those put on 
by the DJ and Vinylphiles Club. 

Tucker said that if the club 
wants to put on events in the 
Price Center or Student Center, it 
must use indoor areas such as the 
Price Center Theater or 
Ballrooms. 

Tucker said he made the deci-
sion because as many as 10,000 
people may have come to UCSD 
for Movement 2000, a volume 
much too large for the Price 
Center Plaza, which should hold 
no more than 5,000 people. He 
said at least 2,000 people - and 
possibly as many as 5,000 - were 
turned away from the event 
because it was so crowded. 

"We had several thousand 
people who showed up and 
couldn't get in," TUCKer said. 
"Whenever you have that many 
people showing up that can't get 
in, it causes problems at the gate. 
There are people disillusioned 
and upset that can't get in, and it 
also causes a lot of trash around 
campus where people wait. So it's 
just too big for the two buildings. 
There's no place in the Price 
Center or Student Center that can 
accommodate the kind of crowds 
they're drawing." 

Tucker said he attended the 
event and made the decision in 
consultation with others after

OII'IUAIIY: Upland native expanded library collections at UCSD, UC Santa Cruz and UC Irvine 
By scan DOIROIIU 
SfIIff ..wrer 

Melvin J. Voigt, UCSD's first 
univenity librarian and the 
architect of UCSD's seven-
library system, died Feb. 4 in La 
Jolla of cardiac arrest. He was 88 
years old. 

Voigt, a native of Upland, 
Calif., was hired by the 
University of California in 1960 
to build a library system for the 
San Diego campus. While work-
ing for the University of 
CalifOrnia, Voigt founded the 
Friends of the UCSD Libraries 
and developed a cost-efficient 
plan 10 purChaae core books for 
three new UC campuses - San 
Diego, Santa Cruz and Irvine. A 

resulting 1967 publication, Books 
for College Libraries, was the 
model for the development of 
many college collections. 

Arthur Brody, a long-time 
friend of Voigt and chairman of 
Brodart (a major manufacturer 
and distributor of library supplies 
and equipment), said Voigt's task 
was tremendous at the time 
because he had to carefully select 
50,000 titles to include in a new 
library. Brody said this was 
extremely difficult because Voigt 
had to compare titles and carefUl-
ly edit his selection to avoid 
duplication of subject malter. 

HI have a great deal of ~ 
for him, H Brody said. 'He 
launched a key pioneering project 
for college li6raries everywhere. 

His list of book titles was pub-
lished nationally by the American 
Library Association and it dictat-
ed to colleges everyw~ what 
ought to be in their libraries. He 
was a very effective bqsinessman. 
He could have been successful in 
any profession he chose." 

VOigt presided with then-
Chancellor Herbert York and 
architect William Pereira over 
the dedication of the , new 
Central Library on March 19, 
1971. 11 was renamed Geisel 
Library in 1995. 

Colleagues and friends of 
Voigt viewed him as a very intel-
ligent and caring man who want-
ed to see the continued educa-

were in attendance. 

He compared the event to the 
Sun God Festival, which was 
originally held in the Price Center 
Plaza but later moved to RIMAC 
field due to the high volume of 
people attending. 

Justin ~, former chair .of 
the DJ and VJnylphiles Club, said 
next year, Movement is likely to 
be held either in the RIMAC 
arena or on the RIMAC field. 

Tucker said that because he 
only oversees the University 
Centers, it would not be his deci-
sion to allow Movement to be 
held at RIMAe. 

He said he believes that if 
Movement is held on campus 
next year, tickets for non-stu-
dents should De sold ahead of 
time, and in limited number, so

"Mel understood that one of 
the determinants of the excel-
lence of a research university is 
the excellence of its libraries," 
University Librarian Brian 
Shottlaender stated. "He set very 
high standards for the quality of 
our collections, and then he 
exceeded those standards. UCSD 
would not be the institution it is 
today without Melvin Voigt. H _ 

would not show up and not be 
admitted. 

Boggs thought Movement was 
a success. 

"It was an awesome phenome-
non,'" Boggs said. "It was really 
encouraging to see a high percent-
age of UCSD students come out." 

80Kgs said his club was never 
notified of Tucker's decision. 

"The administration has decid-
ed without talking to us at all that 
we can't have outdoor events," he 
said. "This is all news we have got-
ten through the grapevine." 

Tucker said that there has been 
no change in actual policy regard-
ing the club. 

"There's no stoppage of 
events," he said. "This isn't a dis-
ciplinary action that says they 
can't use the facility. It's JUst that 
we can't handle the events." 

Boggs said that the a~inis­
tration is "paranOid" abOut the 
success of Movement 2000. He 
said that the administration now 
erroneously believes that 10,000 
people will show up to all events

Tucker said that because 
events put on by the club are 
widely advertised, he has no way 
of knowing how many people 
will show up. 

"They didn't expect the size of 
the cro\¥d that "came," he said. 
Remember they tell us an expect-
ed number on the reservation. 
That was 5,000. I do not believe 
they have the ability to control 
who comes. I can't take that 
chance." 

Boggs said he felt that the 
group was being punished for its 
success in making Movement 
2000 such a large event. 

Tucker said he does not see his 
actions a "punishing" toward the 
club or Boggs. 

"It was very successful," 
Tucker said. "It's become too suc-
cessful for the facilities it's using. 
It certainly wasn't meant as a

Canceling TeSS Will Hurt 
Many Students' Access 

The UCSD administration has announced that the 
Telephone Student Services System will be phased out 
on Sept. 1. 2000. forcing students to use StudentLink's 
WebReg to register if they do not want to do so in per-
son by filling out registration cards. To justify this 
decision. the administration ci~ed the dwindling num-
ber of students who use TeSS and the fact that cancel-
ing the service will save the university money. 

The Guardian feels that neither of these arguments 
constitute sufficient cause for eliminating TeSS. 
Richard Backer, associate vice chancellor of enroll-
ment management and registrar, argued that "only" 
3,474 students used telephone registration during win-
ter quarter, compared to 14.592 students who used 
WebReg. You know what? There are only about 3,500 
students in Warren College - maybe we should get rid 
of it, too. 

The cancellation of TeSS will save the university 
approximately $28,000, meaning that the university 
spends roughly $8 for every student that currently 
uses the system. This amount of money seems paltry 
when compared to other budget items. If the admin-
istration really wants to save money it could phase 
out the all-campus commencement - that would 
save around $100,000. (We're just kidding - please 
don't cancel the all-campus commencement too.) 

There are a number of problems with the proposed 
cancellation. First, every college student has easy 
access to a telephone, but not all of them have com-
parable access to the Internet. Although the universi-
ty does provide free computer labs for students, the 
registration period for classes conveniently coincides 
with midterms when the computer labs are tradition-
ally the busiest. 

Forcing students who do not have their own comput-
ers to use the computer labs on campus also negates the 
convenience that both TeSS and WebReg afford stu-
dents who have access to these systems from home. 
Students who live off campus will have to drive to cam-
pus and go to the computer labs to register for classes 
rather than doing it from their homes on the telephone. 
Commuters who have to come to campus to use a com-
puter with Internet access might as well fiU out registra-
tion cards at the Registrar's office. The system to be 
implemented does not give any added convenience; if 
anything, it will be more of an inconvenience. 

While TeSS has hardly proven to be glitch-free, 
WebReg is at least as susceptible to downtime and 
slow-downs. StudentLink traditionally bogs down 
during peak registration times as the system's servers 
are flooded with requests. Dumping the 3,500 stu-
dents who are currently using TeSS onto WebReg 
will only place more strain on the Web system. 

Internet access is not yet ubiquitous in America, 
even among college students. The Guardian is dis-
turbed that the administration would propose such a 
short-sighted policy, and hopes that it will reconsider 
its decision.

Punishing Underage Drinking· 
Does Not Stop Alcohol Abuse 

" .BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

College is one of the most impor-
tant periods in a person's life. It is a 
time when many students undergo 
profound personal growth and form 
many of the moral and ethical beliefs 
they will carry for the remainder of 
their lives. It is unfortunate, therefore, 
that alcohol abuse, one of the most 
important issues that faces coUege stu-
dents, is not discussed openly on col-
lege campuses. 

A great deal of the problems relat-
ed to alcohol use among college stu-
dents stems from the national drink-
ing age in this country. Young people, 
including college students and high 
school students who are preparing to 
enter college, either devefop their 
drinking habits illegally in environ-
ments not conducive to the develop-
ment of responsible behavior or put 
off drinking until a time when they 
will not benefit from the guidance and 
advice of their parents. 

A 1996 Harvard study found that 
84 percent of college students drink. 
The study also fOun(f that 45 percent 
of college students under the age of 21 
drink. While college campuses gener-
ally offer counseling programs to help 
students with drinking problems, the 
fact that it is illegal for about half of 
the student population to drink 
means college becomes an environ-
ment that often forces underage 
drinking. This in tum makes under-
age drinkers more inclined to hide 
any alcohol related problems they 
may have for fear of facing adminis-
trative or legal repercussions. 

When the national drinking age 
was raised to 21 in the '80s, the inten-
tion was primarily to reduce the 
number of alcohol related deaths in 
America. Current alcohol enforce-
ment policies, however, do not reflect 
a conscientious effort to address these 
dangers of alcohol abuse. Parties 
where people under 21 are drinking 
are broken up and the attendees sent 
home. The logic of this policy Is fright-
eningly counterproductive to contain-
Ing the dangers of drinking - intoxi-

cated individuals who are not 
detained by police officers or campus 
RAs breaking up such parties are then 
compelled to make their way home 
while intoxicated. This policy does 
not control the dangers of drinking, 
but instead merely enforces a puritan-
ical prohibition on drinking for people 
of a certain age group. 

The combination of the legal drink-
ing age and the age of coUege students 
seems designed to breed irresponsible 
behavior even among those who obey 
the law. By making it illegal for people 
to drink before college, the national 

The legal restriction on 
drinking in this country 
creates a culture where 
people do not learn to 
drink responsibly at a 
young l1ge. If they start 
drinking f:R,ter in life they 
will be less prepared to 
practice restraint. 
drinking age delays law-abiding dti-
zens' first exposure to alcohol until 
their college years, a time when they 
have little personal guidance and are 
largely on their own. Many European 
countries have lower drinking ages 
and cultures where young adults start 
drinking with their families in a 
responsible manner. According to the 
non-profit organization Eurocare -
which provides alcohol related statis-
tics - in European counmes such as 
France and Italy where the legal 
drinking age is 16, alcohol related 
rleaths in traffic accidents an! lower 
I er capita than in the United States. 

he legal restriction on drinking in 
this country creates a culture wJ\ere 
people do notleam to drink responsi-
bly at a young age. If they start i1rink-
ing later in life they will be less pre-
pared to practice restraint. 

For underage college students in 
the San Diego area, there are legal 
alternatives to drinking in the United 

States that also promote irresponsible 
behavior. Mexico, where the national 
drinking age Is 18, is a popular desti-
nation for San Diego n5idents under 
the age of 21 who are looking for a 
public place to drink. The proximity 
of a foreign haven for drinking 
encourages overindulgence on the 
infrequent occasions when students 
are able to make the trip - a practice 
commonly known as binge drinking. 
The United States' legal drinking age 
of 21 indirectly encourages young 
Americans to get drunk in a foreign 
country, a dangerous situation. 

The U.s. government considers 18-
year-old citizens responsible enough 
to elect government 9fficials and to 
wield deadly ... ~eapons specifically 
designed for IdlIing in the milita , but 
it does not trust them to UIIe a~ in 
a responsible manner at an age 
younger than 21. Ultimately, outlaw-
ing the consumption of alcohol by 
minors doesn't prevent underage 
drinking anymore than posting speed 
limit signs prevents speeding. Most 
college students an! going to drink, 
just like the rest of the population, and 
perhaps even more so. Whether or not 
they are allowed to do so legally has a 
big impact on how they conduct 
themgefves and the extent to which 
they control their drinking. 

For the time being, lowering the 
drinking age may not be a practical-
or at least not popular - solution to 
alcohol abuse among people under 21 
in this country. However, the current 
drinking age and its enforcement is 
n6t solving the bigger problem of 
alcohol abuse that faces college stu-
dents and society at large. Focusing 
solely on preventing people who an! 
under 21 from drinking does not 
encourage responsible behavior; quite 
the opposite, in fact. Alcohol abuse is 
a dangerous and all-too-often deadly 
problem. If our sodety really wants to 
find a pracbcal solution to alcohol 
abuse, it should stop treating it like a 
crime and recognize it as a personal 
problem that a number of people -
including students - have and deal 
with it as such.

are unsettling to look at because 
they invoke fear. Breast cancer is 
scary. Imagine how difficult it 
must be for women battling this 
di~se to look in the mirror and 
accept their bodies, after just los-
ing part of it. The scars do repre-
sent something beautiful: sur-
vival. 

In the fight against breast can-
cer, something does need to be 
done to increase awareness, 
improve detection methods and 
motivate women to protect them-
selves. This campaign is working 
to achieve these goals. These ads 
may inspire women to take breast 
cancer more seriously and to per-
form regular self-checks and 
mammograms. 

According to Y-ME, the major-
ity of cases occur in women who 
have no identifiable risk factors. 
A simple mammogram can reveal 
small cancers before they can be 
felt. 

One argument against these 
ads was that they might upset 
women and cause them to further 
dodge doctor's visits for fear of 
finding a lump. 

Once again, ignorance is not a 
cure. 

Others think these ads may be 
better suited elsewhere, perhaps 
camouflaged amongst the perfect 
computer-enhanced images in 
fashion magazines. I think that is 
just another attempt to give the 
ads less exposure and leave the 
ads visible to only women who 
can afford magazines. 

Although this disease is rare in 
males, it is still an issue men 
should be aware of. The women 
stricken by breast cancer are your 
friends, your sisters, your girl-
friends and your mothers. This is 
real. 

It may be argued that the use 
of models instead of actual vic-
tims of breast cancer is superfi-
cial, but the ads are designed as 
parodies 01 today's fashion icons 
of sexuality. The ads are still a 
step in the right direction; they 
get attention. . 

These models represent real 
women and a real disease. These

Offensive Ads Work 
COMMENTARY: Shock tactics attract attention 
By JIWAN WIEDA 
Mustang Dally (Cal. Poly State U.) 

(U-WIRE) SAN LUIS OBIS-
PO, Calif. - Unfortunately, I 
don't remember the last time a 
breast cancer ad caught my 
attention. I also don't know 
many female friends who per-
form regular self-checkups. I 
can't say that I do. Many 
women probably don' t even 
know how to perform breast 
self-examination correctly. 

In 1999, it was estimated that 
approximately 176,300 cases of 
breast cancer would be diag-
nosed and more than 43,700 
women would die from the dis-
ease, according to Y-ME, the 
National Breast Cancer 
Organization's Web site. Breast 
cancer is an ugly disease, yet the 
women who have it are any-
thing but. 

Just recently, controversy 
struck the Bay Area after a 
series of poster-sized ads went 
up in numerous bus shelters in 
Santa Clara and Contra Costa 
counties. The women in the 
ads appear to be models for 
Cosmopolitan, Calvin Klein 
perfume or Victoria's Secret 
lingerie. The major difference 
is that these women have mas-
tectomy scars and that these 
ads are designed to increase 
breast cancer awareness, to 
provoke discussion and reac-

tion. A model in one of the 
posters has two red scars 
where her breasts had been. 
The scars, which have been 
superimposed on the models' 
bodies, belong to Andrea 
Martin, founder of the ' Breast 
Cancer Fund, a San Francisco-
based nonprofit organization 
that started the campaign. 
Martin had one breast removed 
in 1989 and the other removed 
in 1991. 

Many have been upset by 
these ads, claiming they are 
unacceptable and too offensive 
for public display. Many of the 
posters have been taken down, 
and companies that own the 
advertising space in the bus 
shelters have refused the cam-
paign. These ads are trying to 
wake society up to the realities 
of this deadly disease, and 
society is looking away, dis-
turbed. 

Why is it that our society is 
so easily disturbed by reality? 
People are constantly watching 
sex, violence, drugs and death 
on television and the big screen, 
looking at half-dressed women 
in magazines without a prob-
lem. 

Now, when 3n ad with a real 
and serious issue is at hand, the 
protests are loud and clear.

1 received the credit card in 
the mail and cut it up immedi-
ately to avoid the dangerous 
temptation that comes along 
with that magnetic strip. I 
expected the promotional junk 
mail for the companies that 
were welcoming me to their ser-
vices. I learned to overlook the 
phone calls from disgruntled 
credit card employees, although 
they repeatedly woke me up in 
the morning. The annoyances 
mounted, but at least I had 
those cute greeting cards, right? 

Then, one day, TIme maga-
zine turned up in my mailbox 
out of the blue. I was thriUed . 
There is nothing more exciting 
than real mail. My first thought 
was that my parents had bought 
a subscription for me in a aes-
perate attempt to keep their scat-
ter-brained daughter educated 
about the events of the world 
outside of UCSO's bubble. 

Much to my surprise, my 
parents denied sending the gift. 
Then .1 remembered the credit 
card company. Pawing through 
my trash can, I found a letter 
saying that the credit card com-
pany would send me Time as a 
gift. Wow, something else for 
free? I got a little skeptical and 
made a phone call. 

The employee on the other 

end of the phone told me that I 
had been charged for the maga-
zine by my credit card company. 
Apparently, the credit card com-
pany had some deal with the 
magazine, subversively tying 
unwitting college students into 
subscriptions that they would 
be challted for if they didn't 
cancel alter a certain time. 

Persistence was my only 
weapon, and I eventually got the 
charRe waived, but not before 
the hassle of calling the credit 
card company and talking to 
five of its incompetent employ-
ees. Worst of all, they said that I 
was basically bound to their 
company for at least a Jear 
because it would look ba on 
my credit history if I canceled a 
card so early. So I guess I have 
more junk mail and early morn-
ing phone calls headed my way. 

The next time you are 
approached by one of those 
seemingly harmless represen-
tatives, do not be fooled . Feel 
free to act as if they are nonex-
istent. Failing to do so may 
entangle you in a mess almost 
as troublesome as joining one 
of those music clubs like BMG 
or Columbia House (yep, I 
made that mistake too). 

As much as I hate to admit 
it, maybe there is no such thing 
as a free lunch. Although I did 
not end up having to make a 
monetary payment, there was 
definitely an emotional charge. 
I spent a little optimism and all 
I received in return was a dose 
of skepticism and some stupid 
greeting cards.

Nicaragua with good grades and 
no prospects. Since her father, a 
farmer, had no money to send 
her to college, she figured mar-
riage and motherhood were her 
onf~ options. 

The medical school is the 
Cuban government's response 
to the devastation from 
Hurricanes Georges and Mitch, 
which ripped through the region 
in 1998, killing thousands as 
they destroyed villages and

that it would be better in the 
long' run to help educate a new 
generation of doctors who 
would return to their impover-
ished countries and work in 
remote communities where 
medical care was spotty and 
expensive. 

The new medical school is the 
culmination of the Cuban gov-

its reputation as a medically

Rather, Wednesday's agree-
ment was seen as one more strate-
gic move by Putin to shore up 
relations with the West, the one 
place where he can find the 
money, technology and expertise 
for rebuilding Russia. 

The State Department's 
spokesman, James P. Rubin, said 
the United States welcomes the 
accord and that Putin has indicat-
ed that "he regards the centrality 
of U.s.-Russian relations as larger 
than differences on key issues." 

"Life has shown us some 
lessons that we cannot forget," 
said Juan Carizo Estevez, the 
school's rector. "That is the 
necessity of the right to health 
care that these countries have. 
We have a responsibility that 
these students return to their 
own countries with a solid foun-
dation for dealing with the prob-
lems of public health they will 
find." 

Medical aid was as impor-
tant an aspect of President Fidel 
Castro's aid to the Third World 
as his nation's training of guer-
rilla and terrorist groups was 
during the Cold War. While 
Cold War conflicts have died 
down, Cuba's latest experiment 
in medical education is still 
tinged with the passions from 
that era.

NRA Promotes Ban on 
Suing Gun Makers 

Nation Discovers Downside of 
Paying Down the National Debt 

. , 

RICHMOND, Va. - For all 
the political oratory and legisla-
tive proposal'l prompted by the 
Coluinbine school shooting ram-
page, one of the few fast-moving 
firearms bills in the nation's state-
houses this year is not a gun-con-
trol measure. 

It is a ban promoted by the 
National Rifle Association against 
cities suing gun manufacturers 
for liability in deadly sprees by 
citizens. 

"It's one of our top priori-
ties," said Jim Baker, the NRA's 
chief lobbyist, who estimated 
that the urban lawsuit ban, 
already enacted into law last 
year in 15 states, would be fully 
approved by 15 to 20 more 

- states this session. 
"We expect to have two-thirds 

of the states done by the end of 
this year," he said of the bill to 
protect gun manufacturers, 
which the NRA is finding far eas-
ier to pursue on a state by state 
basis than in C;ongress. 

The contrast between slow 
moving gun control proposals 
and the rapidly passing lawsuit 
ban was brought home first-

the city lawsuit ban by a vote of 
83-to-17 and sent it to the 
Senate, where it was expected to 
become law. 

NSchool districts were begging 
for passage of my bills, but it did-

observed. •

NEW YORK - Lawrence 
Summers, secretary of the US. 
Treasury, is clearly relishing his 
role as the man who put the 
nation on a no-debt diet. In con-
gressional testimony last week, 
Summers predicted that by 2013, 
the 53.6 trillion in US. Treasury 
debt held by the pubik'would be 
eliminated, repurchased by funds 
from budget surpluses that the 
roaring U.S. economy has 
wrought. The result, he said, 
would be an even stronger econo-
my and lower interest rates for aU. 

Maybe so. In the meantime, 
however, the Treasury's plan to 
reduce its debt is roiling the 
financial markets and raising the 
prospect of far-reaching, urnn-
tended effects on the economy 
and investors. 

One immediate effect of the 
shrinking Treasury debt market, 
economists say, is to make it 
tougher for the Federal Reserve 
Board to cool the economy 
because as it raises short-term 
interest rates, long-term rates are 
not rising in tandem. In addition, 

the debt securities that remain in 
the shrinking market are expected 
to be much more prone to wild 
swings in price and thereby riski-
er for investors. Finally, 'corpora-
tions will probably issue more 
debt to fill the public demand for 
bonds, creating a debt burden 
that could make it much more dif-
ficult for the nation to shake off a 
downturn in the economy. 

Because the market for U.S. 
Treasury debt is the largest and 
most heavily traded in the 
world, and because investors 
evaluate almost every other type 
of bond using a Treasury securi-
ty as a benchmark, even the 
smallest change in the govern-
ment's financing has broad. 
effects at home and ·abroad. 

"One of the reasons the U.S. 
has been the dominant factor in 
the world is we were the only 
place with a deep, liquid dcbt 
market," said Stan Jonas, manag-
ing director at AMAT U.s.A., a 
brokerage firm in New York. "We 
would not be the leader in the 
financial marketplace if we had-

n't had the advantage of a huge, 
rich Treasury rylarket. Now that 
market is disappearing." 

The ripples from a vanishing 
public market for Treasury debt 
have begun to hit investors who 
buy bonds and the companies 
that issue them. Last month, 
when the Treasury outlined its 
aggressive plan to reduce the 
debt it issues and to buy back 
debt already. in investors' hands, 
the market went haywire. There 
was a mad rush for long-term 
government bonds, driving 
down interest rates on long-term 
government debt even as the 
Federal Reserve Board was rais-
ing short-term rates to try to cool 
down an overheated economy. 

This created significant losses 
for investors, who had bet that 
the Fed's increases in short-term 
rates would cause rates at the 
long end of the rnarket to rise as 
well. Instead, the effective rate 
on 3O-year bonds fell well below 
that of two-year not.es.

AFL-CIO SUPPOrts Amnesty Immigrants 
NEW ORLEANS - Adopting 

a sharp change in policy, the 
American labor movement 
Wednesday called for blanket 
amnesty for iUegai immigrants 
and an end to most sanctions

In decades past, labor unions

the enemy, accusing them of 
depressing wages and breaking

of the AFL-CIO adopted a more

HACKERS: 
Computers traced to 
Stanford, UCLA and UCSB 
ContInued from ...,. 1 
network from off campus, Katz said. 

In the wake of hacker strikes last week, 
which immobilized major Web portals for 
hours, investigators have traced computers 
used in the attacks to three major campuses 
- Stanford University, UC Santa Barbara 
and UCLA. 

Katz said the attacks occurred when one 
host computer contacted random comput-
ers from around the world and pro-
grammed them to try to access a Web site at 
the same time. 

The numerous signals overwhelmed the 
host site, which could not distinguish the 
"zombie" computer attacks from genuine 
users, he said. 

Katz said several obstacles prevent the 
university from increasing precautions; to 
create a firewall and protect itself from 
atlilcks, software would have to cost less 
and university computers would have to be 
controlled from a more centralized site. 

Currently, he said each UC Berkeley 
department sets up its own server, and the 
university may have as many as 1,000 sep-
arate servers. This creates more gateways 
for hackers to gain access, he added. 

The UC system operates separate com-
puter networks on each of its campuses, 
said UC spokesperson Mary Spletter. She 
added that each of the nine schools has a 
different vulnerability to attack. 

UC Santa Barbara spokesperson joan 
Magruder said university computer sys-
tems are a "goldmine" for hackers. The 
school's network programmer determined 
Feb. 8 that one of the university's comput-
ers had been used in last weeks hacking 
attack.

were "consistent with the holes and dam-
age." 

He said he believes that the offender 
fired the marbles using a slingshot or some 
other device. 

Officer Alan Jenkins of the Crime 
Prevention Unit said he suspects the van-
dalism to the dance studio and the shuttle 
bus was committed by the same person or 
persons. He also said such acts of vandal-
ism are "out of the ordinary." 

No arrests have been made. 
Anyone with information should con-

tact the Department Detective Bureau at 
534-4359. 

Since January there have been eight 
reported cases of vandalism reported to the 
VCSD Police Department. O'Dell said most 
of the cases involved losses under $200. The 
damage in such cases includes scratches to 
vehicles, a slashed bike seat, a tom convert-
ible lOp, slashed tires and a broken window 
at the Preuss School. 

Jenkins said cases of vandalism are not as 
common as bike theft, car theft and car bur-
glary. He added that bike thefts, auto 

UC campuses do not install firewalls

have protective software.

fa Donor Ad at St.ford 
Draws ,...0lI8l SpoIII_ 

STANFORD, Calif. -In the wake of a 
Stllnford Dtlily advertisement that appeared 
numerous times over the past few weeks, a 
national controversy has' arisen, attracting 
the attention of news media such as CNN 
andMSNBC. 

The advertisement, which .was spon-
sored by a Christian-affiliated organization 
named Families 2000, offered $100,000 for a 
Caucasian donor of "proven college-level 
athletic ability." 

This sum of money marks the largest-
known offer made for an egg donation, 
exceeding the $50,000 egg donor advertise-
ment posted at several upper-tier universi-
ties, including Stanford, in the last academ-
ic year. A typical egg donor receives around 
$4,000 compensation for the procedure . 

Using the phrase "Give the Gift of Love 
and Life," the full-page advertisement 
offers to pay the sum of money either 
directly to the donor or to the charity of her 
choice. 

The moral issues associated with egg 
donation, medical associations across the 
country are acknowledging that the repro-
ductive technology is new and therefore 
carries with it yet-unidentified risks. 

According to the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine, women who 
donate eggs have a heightened risk of con-
tracting ovarian cancer and may experience 
an early onset of menopause.

Jenkins said students can protect their 

bikes by buying V-shaped locks that usual-
ly sell for $35. He also recommended the 
use of anti-theft devices for increased auto-
mobile security. 

According to Jenkins, most stolen cars are 
not ,erotected by any kind of security device. 

'For every car that is protected with 
security there are probably five that are 
not," jenkins said. 

He added that many of the vehicles 
stolen from. campus are those parked for 
more than 24 hours at a time. 

He said the top targeted locations for 
auto theft are Mesa Apartments, Lot 102, 
Lot 701 and Lot 702. He said Ford, Honda 
and Toyota are the top three vehicles stolen 
from on-campus areas. 

He added that the top three targeted 
locations for bike theft are La jolla Del Sol, 
Mesa Apartments and Douglas Hall. 

Last year there were 62 cases of vehicle 
theft reported to the UCSD Police 
Department, a 29 percent increase from 
1998. Auto burglary was down 13 percent 
in 1999 with 84 reported cases. Bike theft 
dropped six percent from 149 cases in 1998 
to 131) last year.

Since the reIeMe of his "Ganpta •

His quest is a noble one. He wants VCSD to

"Everything I do, if people aren't having fun, I

1O HIATUS The UCSD Guardian Thunday. February 17.2000 

As Wholesome as a Balanced Breakfast 
Interview with Buck-O-Nines Jrontman Jon Plebsworth digs Into the hands history and future 
., TALAII PAllUNYAN 
Staff Writer 

- There was a time before the 
heyday of boy bands and bubble-
gum pop songs when you'd turn 
the radio on and hear nothing but 
ska. 

It was an entire attitude that 
took over the hearts and minds of 
teeny boppers in the mid '90s. A 
tidal wave of black and white 
checkers swept the land and, 
inevitably, became a fashion 
statement with a generation of 
teenagers trying to find them- . 
selves in the music. . 

It was a healthy obsession, 
especially if your favorite band 
happened to be Buck-O-Nine, 
who should have been gracing 
the cover of Life cereal. 

They were a band more into 
music than clothing style, which 
can also be attributed to their 
instant success. These boy won-
ders from the Southland came out 
with "28 Teeth" in 1997, which 
differed somewhat from their lat-
est album, "Libido." 

"Any band that has been 
together as long as we have will 
naturally progress into something 
new," Jon Pebsworth said. "Ska 
seems to be this form of music 
that has been around for a long 
time, and it goes through waves. 
History has proven that. I think 
the third wave of ska, the one we 
were a part of, is pretty much 
dead." 

lucks up: See Buck~lne perform at ASUCSO's third annual W1nterfest this FrIday with Ozomatll and CooIIo. 

However, Buck-O-Nine isn't 
taking it upon their shoulders to 
revive the ska scene, and they do 
not think it is the fault of their 
music. 

"\ think the kids actually got 
kinda uninterested in it, and 
without fans and kids, the bands 
just drift away into a lot of differ-
ent territories." 

San Diego, however, is aiding 

the decline of this scene by hav-
ing most of its music clubs be 21 
and over. 

"Some of the 21-plus dubs are 
OK. 1 like the Belly Up and the 
Casbah, but 1 miss Soma a lot, 
and I think ever since it clOsed 
down, it made the scene in San 
Diego suffer really, really, reaJly 
bad. It was one of the best things 
SO ever had," Pebsworth amiably 
said.

months ago with his wife, Laura,

same plssion for music as he had

When powing up, Peblworth 
said he wantecf to be part of 
music more than anything else. 

Pebsworth is just your aver-

ber band has been featured on the 
wildly popular Vans Warped tour 
and recorded its first record with 
T-Kay, the producer behind 
Cypress Hill. Those in attendance 
at this year's event will have a 
chance to see Ozomatli live, an 
experience that Carlos Santana has 
called Mthe future of music." 

There -is more to Ozomatli, 
however, than the danceable com-
bination of Samba beats and mod-
em rap soUJ1(is. The group formed 
five years ago out of a protest at 
the site of the Peace and Justice 
Center, a non-profit organization 
located in downtown Los Angeles. 

At the time, the future mem-
bers of Ozomatli were engaged in 
a struggle to keep the community 
resource center open and its ser-
vices available to needy citizens. 
At first _ the group played only 
political benefits, but its populari-
ty spread and 100I'I it was taking 
its messap of racial and economic 
equality to the most popular 
nightclubs in Hollywood.

" matli's commitment to 

aoc:ial change was emphuized in a 
recent phone interview with Jose 
Espinosa, the group's 26-year-old 
alto saxophonist. 

"For us it is a million to bring 
consdousnesa for those people 

who feel like they have been dis-
enfranchised," Espinola said. "We 
give them a feeling that there is 
hope, there is power and there is a 
place they can go to get help. A lot 
of the issues that are important in 
Southern California are important 
around the globe. 

"The consciousness here in 
LA. has gotten better," Espinoza 

added. "Small movements are 
linking together. Especially things 
like support for political prisoner 
Mumia Abu Jamal. The. little 
things are getting stronger and 
stronger every year. More people 
come out to support the Zapatistas 
and immigrants' rights. People are 
talking about it. They're more 
involved, but in other areas, it's

harder to understand what's 
going on. Or people understand 
what's going on, but they don't 
know how to approach it. They 
don't know how to get involved. 

"The situation in L.A. is crazy. 
Over by MacArthur Park, they call 
it an area in transition," EspinOsa 
continued. "r eople live over there 
and they are having their rights 
violated. The police have barricad-
ed the neighborhood and they 
have sweeps there. We tried to do 
a benefit there for the Zapatistas, 
and that night they had a sweep. 
Basically everybody had to get off 
the streets. You had to leave the 
area. The police came in full riot 
gear, and that happens on a regu-
lar basis." 

According to Espinosa, 
Ozomatli align themselves with 
activist groups such as Refuse and 
Resist. 

"Refuse and Resist is against 
police brutality, which coincides 
with the Mumia Abu Jamal case. 
They have a list that keeps count 
of the thousands of people who 
have been killed by the police. 
Basically it's a stolen lives project, 
and 'that's what they try to do." 

Although Espinosa is con-
cerned about the situation in his 
hometown of Los Angeles, he real-
izes that Ozomatli may realize 
their greatest success by taking 
their message of equality outside 
city limits. 

"To preach to the converted, 
that's one thing," Espinosa said. 
"That's only a limited number of 
people. We try to get the message 
out to new people."

'The Next Episode' Starts Today 
San Francisco and Los Angeles artists come to San Diego for a dance concert at Sushi performance 
By HANNAH 8RlFFITH 
Staff Writer 

"The Next Episode-Tran-
scending Traditions" opens 
tonight for a three-day run at 
Sushi Performance and Visual 
Arts center downtown. The 
Patricia Rincon Dance Collective 
will present work by Ilaan Ege-
land, Jo Kreiter, Melissa Nunn 
and Rincon, who is a dance pro-
fessor at UCSD; With two local 
and two out-of-town choreogra-
phers, the show looks to be varied 
and interesting. 

Of particula r note is the 
opportunity to see the work of 
Kreiter, who is a San Francisco-
based choreographer, dancer, 
aerialist and improviser. She is 
one of only a few women in the 
world to have expertise in Chi-
nese pole acrobatics and was 
nominated in 1999 for the Isadora 
Duncan Dance Award fo r her per-
formance on steel poles. 

Flyaway Productions, the 
company K~eiter fou nded in 
1995, performs apparatus-based 
pieces in both traditional venues 
and site-specific locations such as 
fire escapes, windows, rooftops, 
catwalks, a\leys and anchored 
and suspended steel ·poles. The 
company's most recent perfor-
mance took place on a 70 foot 
industrial crane in the San Fran-
cisco Bay. 

"As wireles technology 
asserts itself as the communica-
tive norm, the body is slipping 
further and further away from 
the center of human exchange," 
Kreiter said of her 1999 work 
"The Body Project/the soul needs 
the body," which wm be per-
formed at ushi. "fn Sa n Diego, 
the company will perform an 
excerpt that celebrates physical 
trust and face-ta-face intimacy." 

In "Stripping the Veneer," Los 
Angeles choreographer Ilaan 
Egeland uses dance, text, slides 
and lots of clothes to deal with 

perceptions of the female body 
and an audience's voyeuristic 
role or tendencies. Egeland, a 
MFA student and modem dance 
teacher a t UCLA, also dances 
w ith David Rousseve/ REALlTY. 

Both visiting artists will leach 
master classes a t Sushi on Satur· 
day from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. 
Kreiter will teach '1'echnique of 
flight and floor work," from 1:00 
p.m. to 2:30 p.m. Egeland will 
teach Modern Dance. The cost is 
$8 for each class; ca\l (619) 235-
8468 for information. 

The two San Diego artists will 
be p remiering work as w el l. Rin-
con will show "Changing Chan-
nels," a new piece she is setting 
simultaneously on a cast of UCSD 
students fo r "An Evening of 
Dance," which will be performed 
on campus in the Mande l Weiss 
Center during 10th week. 

Changing Channels" is a jaunt 
through the int rospective and 
humorous stories of our lives. It's 
about how what we were in the 
seventh and eighth grades - in 
our youth and adolescence - is 
wha t makes us what we are 
today," Rincon said . 

Rincon has received many 
loca l awards over the years, 
including the 1998 Tommy Award 
fo r Best Choreographer and the 
1999 Latina of the Year for Arts 
and Culture award fo r her work 
with Latino youth . 

Melissa Nun, who has also 
received numerous local awards 
for dance and fo r teaching, and 
has had her work performed in 
Chicago, L.A., Bern, Lond6n and 

.Paris, will show "Sola rium," 
choreographed to music by Steve 
Reich. 

HThe Next Episode" will be 
performed today, tomorrow and 
Saturday at 8 p .m. at Sushi, which 
is located at 320 11th Avenue, 
between J and K Streets. TIckets 
are $18 general admission and 
$15 discount; ca ll (619) 235-8459

C • • llnl lll .... ..... 

Looking back at the past three 
years, It Is easy to see why some 
fans are more than a little worried 
that Coolio's edge now resembles 
the Safe.. T Pumpkin Carver. Crit-
ics point to the Grammy and the 
17 miUion selling success of 

"'~" PandiIe" to explain 
CooIiO', transfonnation. 

Coolio disagrees. 
"'I'm ordinary, I'm 1eRUlar. I'm 

not floesin', I'm not lrontln'. I 
don't ta1k about this luxurious life 
I live, I don't talk about that shit," 
Coolio said. 

One bump in the road was 
Weird AI's spoof ., Amish Par-
adile," which lampooned the 
Amish NIiPJn and CooUo's run· 
awar hit 1rom the "DIInaerous

WhIle most artistI consider

WIlile the e1ectridty-lacldng

1hen came the four consecu·

nabbed two. However, as a father 
of BeVen. he doesn't have a pr0b-

Golf Takes Fifth in Tournament I VOLLEY: Tritons can't stop 
Anteater attack 

GRIFFEY: 
Mets will need 
A-RodJo keep up 
eo. ...... "... ..... 
provide it. 

FORE: Tritons manage to place three golfers in event's top 20 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

Valentine's Day is supposed to 
be a day filled with love and joy, 
feelings of the heart that make for 
gooey showings of affection 
brought to you by Cupid. 

For the UCSD golf team, this 
past Monday was not one to 
remember, as Cupid's arrows 
missed their targets. 

On the day of hearts and 
roses, the Tritons placed fifth out 
of seven teams ·at the Cal State 
San Marcos Invitational. 

"Even though it is a local 
course, it is private," said UCSD 
Head Coach Mike Wydlj). Nit is 
the hilliest golf course of the 81 
in San Diego County." 

Recovering from a horrible 
first round in which the team 
shot a 299, San Bernadino 
bounced back in the second 
round with a 290 and took first 
with a score of 589. 

Cal State Bakersfield grabbed 
second after a fantastic second 
round of 293 to finish with a 603. 

Point Lorna Nazarene 
University scored a 606 for third 
place. The host team finished 
fourth with a 612, and the Tritons 
were in fifth after shooting a 615. 
A score of 620 gave sixth to Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo and 
California Baptist University fin-
ished last after shooting a 622. 

UCSD placed three golfers in 
the top 20 of the par 71, 6,345-
yard, two-day event. 

Andy Thompson finished 
first for UCSD and fifth overall 
with a two-round score of 147. 
Thompson shot a three over par 
74 in the first round and a two 

over par 73 in the second. 
Darin Sulivan took second 

for UCSD and ninth overall. His 
first-round six over par 77 and 
his second-round two over par 
73 combined for an overall score 
of 150. 

"Darin was number one com-
ing in and he is a close number 

«Ben Page was though 
of as our number-one 
starter coming into 
the season) but he had 
some personal problems 
and is now kind of 
like our sixth man.» 

- Mik. w,drll 
Gott Head Coach 

two now," Wydra said . 
James Donahoe finished 14th 

overall and third on the Triton 
squad. Donahoe had a stellar 
first-round score of one under 
par 70 but had a rough second · 
round and shot an 11 over par 82 
for an overall score of 152. 

"We worked hard this past 
week," said Wydra, whose 
Tritons helped out at the Buick 
Invitational at Torrey Pines this 
past weekend. "[Donahoe] 
worked all morning at Torrey 
Pines. He shot a wonderful 70, 
but he was a little tired in the 
afternoon." 

Barry Grounds finished first 
for San Bernadino with a score of 
139, the only player to finish

under par with a first-round two 
under par 69 and a second-
round one under par 70. 

. Other Tritons competitors 
were David Hensen, who scored 
a 11 over par 82 and a 13 over par 
85 for a 167. Jeff Durston, who 
didn't shoot in the first round, a 
shot an 84 in the second. 

1Wo weeks ago UCSD had a 
fine showing at the Cal Sate 
Bakersfiled Invitational. The 
Tritons took second out of 11 
teams, with Donahoe leading 
the way with a 66. 

"We played much better at 
Bakersfield," Wydra said of the 
Tritons' off day on Monday. . 

The season is still young and 
UCSD is trying to find its direc-
tion. 

"We are still trying to find out 
who our top five are," Wydra 
said. "We are doing a little re-
qualifying." 

Wydra sees the Tritons with a 
number of contenders for the 
five-man squad. 

"Ben Page was thought of as 
our number-one starter coming 
into the season, but he has had 
some personal problems and is 
now kind of like sixth man," 
Wydra said. "Brian Reverly and 
Rex Vanderpoole are also doing 
well We have a lot of people 
knocking at the door." 

The Tritons next head back to 
the green on Friday, Feb. 25 
when they travel to face Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. . 

"This is all kind of a prelude 
to our tournament at Torrey 
Pines March 3 and 4," Wydra 
said. "It's one of the largest col-
lege golf events west of tli\! 
MissiSSippi." 

0 ................... . 
cal,led upon by the Triton coach-
ing staff to be a team leader, par-
tially fulfilled that role by scor-
ing 12. Kevin Flynn supple-
mented the offense with 10 kiUs. 

In game two, middles 
Matthew Holve and Kevin 
Flynn were being clobbered by 
the Anteater attack. UC Irvine 
exploited the Tritons middle 
through all &hree games. 

UCSD's inability to dig balls 
out that should have been dug 
also was a factor in Irvine's 
beating the Thtons. In addition, 
the Tritons could not get any 
consistent serving. Their game 
would fall apart after sideouts, 
and they racked up a total of 12 
service errors. 

The Tritons were rallying at 
one point in the third game when 
they pulled within 11-8 after 
being down big early. This was 
the only point when the Tritons 
could have possibly made the 
match look liXe a clasJ{ between 
two rivals. However, UCSD com-
mitted a service error, and from 
then on out, it was all downhill 
for the Thtons. UC Irvine 
knocked in four straight points 
and was a\yarded the match vic-
tory to better their record to 5-7. 
UCSD fell to 3-8, and will travel 
to Provo, Utah to play Brigham 
Young University on Friday Feb. 
25th. Playing a school which has 
produced athletes the likes of 
Steve Young isn't what the 
Tritons really wan! to compete 
against at this point. However, 
from an improvement perspec-
tive, playing another Division I 
school will help them prepare for 
Division ill competition for the 
second half of the season. 

So who are the likely con-
tenders? Now that the Reds 
have bolstered their lineup, the 
Braves will have to be looking to 
do the same, which puts them in 
the running. The Yankees are 
usually the front-runner for 
every free agent but this time 
they won't be a factor, since they 
already have all-world short-
stop Dere.k Jeter. The Mets will 
be courting A-Rod, and you can 
almost count on Rupert 
Murdock and the Dodgers mak-
ing a run for Rodriguez. 

How much will Alex 
Rodgiuez get? Griffey could 
have had about $20 million a 
year but decided to take much 
less so he could go home to 
Cinncinati with his father. This 
is very refreshing to see in a 
sports world that routinely 
looks only at the bottom line. 

Rodriguez won' t make the 
same choice. Expect A-Rod to 
be the first 520 million man in 
baseball. He will make so 
much money that only the big-
market teams can afford him. 
Luckily for him, all of the big-
market teams, other than the 
Yankees, will be interested in 
getting him. No matter where 
he goes, he will soon be a very 
rich man. Aquiring A-Rod will 
definitely make any team into 
an instant contender, and in the 
case of the Mets or the Braves, 
the instant favorite to win the 
World Series. 

I expect A-Rod to go to the 
Mets, and we will be treated to 
an all-New York World Series. 
Another year, another snoozer 
for us West Coast fans.

Griffey trade may 
stir up rankings 

Players being traded at the 
height of their career::; - it has 
happened. before, and it has 
now happened again. Ken 
Griffey }r:s trade to Cincinnati 
from Seattle was the block-
buster deal of the year. The 
questions are: How does it 
affect the teams involved? 
How does it affect the rest of 
the league, and how dOP.S it 
affect the possible Alex 
Rodriguez deal that could be 
next for the Mariners? 

First of all: How does it 
affect the teams involved? It 
certainly puts the Reds in con-
tention for the National 
League pennant for the first 
time sinct! they won the World 
Series in 1990. Griffey gives 
the Reds probably the most 
feared lineup in alf of baseball, 
a lineup that includes him, 
Barry Larkin, Dante Blchette 
and Sean Casey. 

The problem for the Reds is 
pitching. Denny Neagle and 
Pete Harnisch are apparently 
the aces of the staff and they 
both have chronic injury prob-
lems. Their trade of Bret 
Tomko for Griffey makes their 
staff that much thinner. Still, 
the Reds have put together a 
contender with a total team 
salary of less than $60 million, 
something that seemed almost 
unheard of a year ago. 

The Mariners are screwed. 
Not only are they losing the 
best players in baseball today, 
but they didn't get all that 
much in return. As result, their 
pitching staff is still pathetic, 
while their offense will be hurt 
a great deal by the move. 
Don't expect the Mariners to 
be in contention any time 
soon. 

History has mixed mes-
sages for teams trading mar-
quee talent in their prime. 
The Red Sox traded Babe 
Ruth in his prime, and they 
haven't won a World Series 
since. The Dallas Cowboys 
traded Herschel Walker in his 
prime, and within seven 
years were once again 
America's team. 

When Gretzky got traded 
from the Edmonton Oilers to 
the L6s Angeles Kings, it 
ended the Oilers dynasty, 
which had been almost 
unstoppable before that. The 
other hockey trade that com-
pares to the Grelzky deal is 
when the then-Quebec 
Nordiques traded Eric Lindros 
when they found that they 
wouldn't be able to sign him. 
After the team moved to 
Colorado, the players they got 
for Lindros, most notably 
superstar Peter Forsberg, 
made them a perennial con-
tender. 

Other contenders are going 
to be looking to match the 
addition that the Reds made. 
The only single addition that 
can match the Griffey acquisi-
tion is Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod 
is likely to be shopped to 
another team because he loves 
the limelight and Seattle can't

Volleyball Falls to UCI Anteaters 
ACED: Men's volleyball now has a three-game losing streak, all against Division I opponents 
By BRIAN WEllES 
Associate Sports Editor 

There was no rest for the 
weary on Tuesday night 

That must have been what the 
Triton men's volleyball team was 
thinking of Tuesday at UC Irvine 
when the Tritons fell . to the 
Anteaters in three straight sets 15-
3, 15-7, 15-8. 

Coming into this game, the 
UCSD men's volleyball team was 
annoyingly riding the train of a 
two game losing streak after get-
ting crushed by powerhouses 
UCLA and Stanford. 

They had just faced two very 
strong and highly-skilled oppo-
nents from Division I. What is 
there reward? Another Division I 
opponent. 

They were coming off, 
arguably, the worst played game 
of the year. Against Stanford in 
the third game, the Tritons could 
be best described as dying fish. 
They were emotionally flat, there 
was no leadership on the court, 
and they only scored two points. 

The life of UCSD men's volley-
ball, from the perspective of fa.ns, 
players, and coaches, needed to 
get livelier before it got any more 
dormant. They again were facing 
a Mount Pacific Sports Federation 
opponent, but this time they felt 
they had more of a chance 

Attempting to unleash them-
selves from the misery of such 
woes, the Tritons took the court in 
game one at Irvine. 

The game didn' t go well for 
UCSD from the outset. The good 
news is that UCSD, at least from a 
statistical standpoint, beat out 
their opponent more often as the 
game progressed. 

Despite ameliorating their 
overall offensive output and play, 
the Tritons were swept in three 
straight again, and UC Irvine out-
slugged San Diego .467 to .254 in 
the hiUing percentage deparl-

ment. Supporting Triton difficul-
ties on the offensive side was the 
fact that Irvine collected 33 digs 
to UCSD's 24. The Anteaters kept 
the pressure on the Tritons for 
most of the three games of the 
match, limiting UCSD's chances 
at the net. Ben Vernon, a player 
who usually scores a lot of kills 

when passing for UCSD is sharp, 
had nothing in the kill column. 
Irvine managed to keep Triton 
spikes alive, thus determining the 
tempo of ball movement when 
UCSD failed to score points after 
sideouts. UCSD could not insti-
gate their passing attack, but 
rather performed it in a defensive 

manner. 
Donald Chen gave Tritons 

something to shout about by once

points. He got his usual double 
digits with a very respectable 19

Tennis Gets Brst Win of Season 
VICTORY: .Four singles victories help the Tritons to a 5-2 triumph over USIU 
By au BURGER 
Sports Editor 

With a lot to prove after its 
opening match against Brigham 
Young University, the men's ten-
nis team took the courts last 
Tuesday against the United States 
International University. 

The Tritons had a good match 
against 8YU but it did not show 
up on the score sheet. This was 
the opportunity they needed to 
make amends. 

In the end, UCSD sent USIU 
packing home with a dominant 5-
2 victory. 

"They were better than they 
were last year," Head Coach Eric 
Steidlmayer said. "They had 
some good players, but we just 
played well. ' 

At number-one singles, 
Michael Meyer took care of busi-
ness quickly and in dominant 
fashiOn with a 6-0, 6-2 drubbing 
of his opponent. Meyer was the 
only Triton to win against BYU 
and continued his impressive 
play in the match against USIU. 

Corey Moderhak played num-
ber-two singles for the Tritons 

and was equally dominant. 
Moderhak handed his opponent a 
6-2,6-3 defeat to earn his first vic-
tory of the year.

Steidlmayer said. 
"[Moderhak] still

At number-three sin-
gles, Mike Rosett had little 
trouble against USIU's Eric 
Grimmer. Rosett handled every-
thing that Grimmer sent at him 
and ended up with a 6-1, 6-2 vic-
tory. 

UCSD lost at both number-
four and number-five sin. as
