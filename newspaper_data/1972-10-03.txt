The NEXUS 
The recent events involving the 

UCS8 DAilY NEXUS and the UCSB 
administra tion bear close scrutiny. 
fhr takeover of the NEXUS for one 
IS\U(' this past summer is a dangerous 
precedent. It is a move that must be 
mel wi th public outcry. 

[,lfly In the summer the NEXUS 
pnntE'd a story on alleged corruption 
In thl' Santa Barbara city govern-
menl. Those individuals named in 
Ihe artic le claimed that thi. 
allega tions were false and demanded 
a full retraction. The NEXUS refused 
to do so, and the UCSB administra-
tion, under pressure from the city 
distflcl attorney (named, among 
others, in the story), took over the 
NEXUS for the July 5 is ue. 

The UCSB administration acted 
out of fear o f invo lvement in litiga-
tion . This was a wholly unjust and 
irresponsible move by the UCSB 
administration . A student newspaper 
mu,t have the freedom to print news 
vital to the University community. 
When a newspaper no longer has 
the freedom to print the truth, no 
matter whose political loes are 
crushe d, the n its function is 
diminished to nothing more than an 
announcement rag for the campus. 

TI\ case of the NEXUS is a touchy 
one. The documenta tion the NEXUS 
used in its story on corrupt city 
Ilovernm nt was never proven to be 
fa lse . Th current move by the 

EXUS to become independent of 
University financing is a move oul of 
frusH Jlion . The UCS B administration 
IS welcoming the mov because it 
will no long r have to fear involve-
ment in litigation against the NEXUS. 

The persons named in the NEXUS 
~tory never fil ed suit for libel. 

The TRITO TIME supports the 
DAilY NEXUS in its struggle for sur: 
vival. A dangerous precedent has 
been set. If the NEXUS is forced off 
cali.pus for printing a responsible 
article on commu nity events 
because the campus administration 
is afraid of litigation the door will be 
open for other UC administrations to 
censor, repress and destroy student 
new papers whenever they choose. 

The TRITON TIMES views the 
takeover of the NEXUS by the UCSB 
administration as hasty and un -
warranted. The administration's sup-
port of the NEXUS' proposed in-
dependence is unju stified. 

Student press will. not be 
destroyed at UCSB. Nor will it be 
censored or destroyed here . 

Hi tchhiking 
ror many UCSD students who liv many peopie continue to hitchhike. 

In northwest San Diego and North Wh E' n asked by the TRITON TIMES 
Cou nly (Del Mar, Solana Beach, etc.) why, some students stated they had

Programming Made Simple 
What goes into the planning of a 

year of enlertainment for the un -
iversity community is for the most 
part shrouded in mystery . Student 
money gets channelled and por-
tioned into a variety of projects 
without any real approval of the 
peopll' who are supplying the fund s. 
How Ihe campus programming is 
done is adually a simple process, 
and student involvement need not 
be limited to approval or disap-
proval after th-. fact. 

Three years ago the Campus Wide 
Programming Board operated as the 
Commince for Arts and LeCtures 
and was head d by Jim Londord . 
Using student activity money the 
committee worked for community 
involvement in the arts, producing 
many events in La lolla's Sherwood 
Hall and other locations off campus . 
The AS Programming Board concen -
trated its efforls on campus activities 
such as film series, concerts and 
coffee hut entertainment; and the 
two groups worked back and forth 
to provide a balance of e vents and to 
aVOid conlliding dates. As enroll -
m nt grew and stud e nt fees in-
creased the desi re for more campus-
oriented programming was voi ed 
b the studenl" and with th l' demi se 
of A the effom of the Board have 
been directed to those wishes. 

The Campus Wide Programming 
Board is now a Chdncl' IIor's com -
mittee lead by Diane Annala , the 
vl'ly able Dean of Studl'nl Adlvitll'S, 
and th(' student voice on the Board 
has greatly increased. Originally the 
sludl'nt vot l' consisted of one 
r('presentative from ea h college, 
two representatives at large, plus the 
AS elected programming chairman. 
The new formation of the com-
mittee has a carefully worked stu-
dent majority; with fifteen vOling 
m mb rs eighl are sludents, four are 

fa c ully membl'l s, and threl' arp 
members of th administration, all 
from tudenl Affairs. Two students 
now represent each coll ege and two 
graduate stude nl s re presen t eilhe r 
rripps or Ihe Medi cal school and 

Ihl' rest of the ca mpu s at large. 
Planning the budge t for Ih(' com -

ing year begins during Ihe summer 
with a careful review of previous 
programs. Thl' board evaluates Ihe 
production s of th e year a nd 
reevaluates its prior tics based upon 
those decisions. Mon l'Y IS than 
blocked out in rough terms as new 
events are planned by the board 's 
five subcommillees covering lec-
tures/ poetry, dance/ drama, films, 
music, and special events. Members 
of the board may work with any su b-
commillee that interests Ih e m, and 
members of Ihe stud e nt bod y are 
also wel come to join . Th e sub-
committees generate Ihe specific 
idea s, e ntertaining proposa ls from 
ou tside groups and making recom-
mendalions to th e board based 
upon standard s of quality of perfor-
mance, va ll ety, Interest on campus , 
and educali onal value. The board 
then makes th(' final decision and 
bargains wllh Ihl' aCI for SPP( IfK 
accommodatoons and fres . 

Ever y studrnt on th !' Pro/iram-
mlng board IS s('ll'cl r d hy I h('

OxyOutlastsTritons 
in Opening Game 

aturday marked a turning point for UCSD water polo in 
1972. It denoted the opening of the season, O ccidental 
being the first opponent. Unfortunately it concurrently 
marked the end of only the first we k of practice, and was 
highlighted by the absence of several fairly important 
people, like folr instance, a few players. But none the less, If 
we look through the sloppiness, the miscues, the bad 
passing, the lousy shooting, and the j u st plain 
poopendness of the players, we can see, as astute 
observers, a spark of billiance which may emerge as one of 
the most powerful Intercollegiate teams ever to hack its 
way through a schedule. 

From the outset everybody was apologizing to 
everybody else. We were apologizing for the late start and 
short warm up. They were apologizing for scheduling us so 
early. We were sorry about the reffing. They were sorry 
that we hadn't had more time to get into shape. All in all it 
was a very sorry game, the end of which lound UCSD on 
the embarassing end of an embarassing score. Why then 
could most 01 the team come away smiling and be able to 
stomach cheap hot dogs at the coach's house after the 
game 

Well, the lact that Coach Fred Becker's wile is a fOK 
hl'lped a little. But besides that the fact that Occidental IS 
,(heduled again at the !'nd 01 the season helped even 
more II the Tritons don't beat Oxy 3000 to 0, then 
something's rotten In Eagle Rock. The Simple fact of the 
')',lltN was that UCSD is stdl plum out 01 shape. After the 

~Itlal shock 01 being in Ihe a WdtN with people who

a you just spent a fun-
li ll ed we ekend si ttin g 
around doing nothing, 
rig ht ? Sure, the party Satur-
day night was great , but by 
Sunday afternoon you had 
recovered from that and 
you were getting a lillie 
restless, and rea lly wanted 
something to do. Is tha t 
what ai ls you? Well, don't 
despai r, my friends, for a 
mi racle cu re is -raring you 
right in the lar p ... coed 
flag footba ll has arrived! 
The g r ea tes t cu re f o r 
boredom (since man in-
vented the ioint) is upon us. 

For all you su per-jocks, 
It 's a great chance to show 
of{ you r man ly skill to 
those admi ring coeds, And 
for all you women's libbers, 
where are ever 

to get a better opportunity 
10 prove that you can hold 
your own in a o man 's 
world "! As for the rest of 
us, coed lootball is a lan-
tastic way to meet people, 
get some exercise, and have 
a lo t of fun. 

0, all you have 10 do to 
tak e advant age of thi s 
once-in-a-liletime oppor-
tun ity is get together at 
least lou r guys and fou r 
chicks and get one o f them 
ove r t o th e ca pt ain 's

classroom at 4 p .m. on 
Thursdat . Game are on 
we ken ds and w ee kd ay 
afternoons, and only las t 
about an hour or so, so 
don't try to say you don't 

have enough time! Just get 
a few people together and 
sign up. The game is fun , 
casual , and practi cally 
painless. 

Of course if you're not 
up for flag football, how 
about a friend ly game of 
six-body coed volleyball? 
The teams are going to 
range from excellent to 
pathetic, so whatever your 
abilil ies are, if you like 
volleyball , get on over to 
th in lramural office and 
pi k up a signup sheet. The

Allright, so you sa y you 

don't like football , and you 
don't play voll ey-
ball ... don't give up , 
we've got one last hope lor 
you . Would you beli eve 
coed inner-rube basketball 
in the paoli Now there is 
just no rea son at all not to 
play that, unless you 're 
allergic to water. Just exact-

guaranteed to be fun ,

UCSDCCTeam 
Drops Initial Meet 

Mark Liska 
The cross country team 

definitely did not shake up 
any high-ranking powers 
across the country with 
their inconspicuous 
premiere performance last 
Saturday up at Riverside, 
One might say it was a 
touch 01 Olympic loul -up 
with UCSD being its own 
and thl' weather 's victim 

however, it was not a 
memorable one for the 
UCSD team, contrary to 
that of the San Fernando 
team, The top IlOish r for 
UCSD was Ireshman Mike 
B rgkamp, the freshman 
from San Jose He ran a 
good race and linished 
ninth. Next to place was 
Chuck Crumley. Chuck was 
much improved over la~t 
year and placed to 15th 
spot Coming In right 
behind him was freshman 
Mik(' DeSosa who ran a 
well -paced race, comong on 
strong on the lint~h. 

The final team results 
could have bl'en better lor 
UCSD. and they couldn't 
have be!'n worse They 
linished fourth behind first 
team San Fernando Valley 
State College, second 
Fresno- Pacific, and UC 

River~ide . San Fernando 
had a great meet, finishing 
about seven of their 
runners in Ihe top 10 men. 
That is rather good. 

The cross country team 15 
looking lorward to better 
thlOgs to come, however, 
dnd rightly so Don 
Campbell IS one plus for 
the future He is a rl'(rUft 
I rom t he track tea m and 
should be gl'tt i ng into 
Shdpe soon. AI~o, Ed Avol 
and Kirk Newell and Bob 
Perez should be rounding 
themselves Into better 
shape 

The next big ev('n IS the 
All-Cal Cron Country 
Meet. This Y!'3r it is at Santo! 
Bo!rbara and all of the big 
schoo ls, along w ith the 
small ones will be there. 
Among those Will b£· C

As it remtoder to .11 those 
hardy individuals Interested 
10 the crew team, there will 

be an important meeting 
this Thursday, Oct. 5 The 
meeting will take place tn 

the P.E. classroom oIt 7 P m . 
so there should not be any 
class conflicts Anyone IIl-

terested In partiCipalfng on 
the crew team, but who will 
nOI be able to attend the 

meeting should gl't In 
touch with the Pf Depart-
ment by calhng X217S or by 
gglng personally to thf' 01-
lices on the onh side of 
the gym. 

The day didn't start off on 
the right foot, ~o to ~peak 
The team began its Journey 
up to RiverSIde two men 
\hort, carrying only a con-
tingent of seven. Ed Avol, 
last yea r's number-one 
man, did not make the trip. 
He was joinpd in hi s 
absence by another 01 last 
year's "big guns," Bob 
DeLeonardis. A usually 
reliable source reported 
that Bob did not make the 
trip for personal reasons. 

So the seven members of 
UCSD's out-of-shape (for 
the most part) cross country 
team appeared at Riverside 
and took note 01 the com-
petition, notably Fresno-
Pacilic, UC Riverside and 
San Fernando Valley State 
College,

The race started and so 
did the antics lor the UCSD 

'~am . The weather was cer-
tainly not conducive for 
running, as a matter of fact, 
one might call it quite a 
hindrance, and many did. It 
was typically Riverside, 
temperature above 90 and 
smog so heavy you needed 
a knile to cu t through it. 
T h is deterr ed certain 
members of the UCSD team 
from appearing in top form, 
notably Kirk Newell, last 
year's lavorite RA , and 
sop homore Bob Pere7 . 
Both of these runners did 
not finish the race because 
of the adver e conditions.

their Bio labs to stand at the 
fountain and oggle the 
girls. 

What has ha ppened? 
We ll it seems to me that no 
one told the frosh of our 
outstanding academic 
record . Thus, not being 
totally blown out from the 
outset they just let their 
natural beauty " hang 
loos .. and inunda te the 
campus. This miracle has 
bee n facilitated bv two 
thing , favoraole weOlther, 
and a good summer for 
styles in clothes; short skirts 
and backless dresses are 
much better to look at than 
anything by Irving Goof-
man? 

Much has happened as a 
result of this frosh wave of 
beauty - for one thing the 
returning women have 
decided to do the jean 
routine, and meet the frosh 
challe nge head on; proving 

once and for all that MUIT 
and Revelle (Third College 
was never in doubt) did 
have women after all. 

The question that arises 
now is how will the men at 
UCSD react to this? 50 far 
the re have been a lot of 
EH's and AH's, and thos 
are just the profs and the 
TA's. It is really a shocking 
experience to walk into a 
class that you are tutoring 
and find that it is replete 
with beauty. One must 
wonder what it must be like 
to be a student and have to 
live with it all. WOW! 

What will happen to 
academia? Will UCSD still 
be the study center of the 
world? Or will the dreaded 
jean and work shirt take 
control again? What can I 
say? let your mind and 
body decide, or if not let 
someone else give you a 
hint . 

Making Difference •. . 
felt that it wouldbe better for students to work early in the 
decision mak ing process than to try to change decisions 
already made by administrators. 

Dean of Revelle College, Ernie Mort, is another one who 
encourages students to get on both college and university· 
wide committees. He said that as an administrator, " Our 
role is the goal and the goal is feedback ." He feels that too 
often administrators are forced to make decisions affecting 
stud nts without adequate knowledge. Unless students 
become involved in committee work their views can never 
be fully known. 

There are now at least eight committees, both at the 
college and university level, which have student vacancies 
The newest committee is the Advisor Council on Student 
Life Interests. This group was formed this summer to advise 
the chancellor on how the students feel about important 
issues. Another important committee is the Advisory 
Committee for UniverSity Registrat ion Fee. This is the 
committee which decides how to spend the money 
collected at registration . Since it is the UCSD students' 
money that IS beIng spent, it would seem that they would 
have a vital Interest in this committee also. 

Othl"r commIttees which have openings for students are 
faIrly self-explanatory. These include the Revelle College 
Provost Search Committee, the Bookstore AdVisory Com· 
mlttee, the Parking Committee, and the Build ing Advisory 
Committees for the ResIdence Halls, the Student Center, 
and thl" ~tudent Health Center 

Altogether over a dOlen tuqents are needed for these 
commlttN'S. All UCSD students, Including freshman, are 
elrglble to SIt on these important committe s. Appl icatiom

Graduate Division Cures Doctorate Dilemma 
Graduate stud nts who 

com pl eted programs 
leadi ng to the Ph .D. degree 
at UCSD this past year have 
been highly successful in 
finding jobs. 

A recently comp leted 
ca'l!Pus survey, conducted 
by The Office of Graduate 
Stu dies and Resea rc h at 
UCSD, shows that 95 per-
ce nt of the graduate 
s tudents reportl"d as 
seeking position s have 
been successful in their 
search . At present 108 of 
113 recent - or soon to 
be - Ph .D. recipients have 
jo bs , mainly industry , 
research, or teaching. 

According to Dr. Roy 
Harvey Pearce, Acting Dean 
of Graduate Studies, 
despite the generally tight 
job market across the coun-
try, it appears that most of 
the nation's top graduate 
stu dents have been 
accepted into tea ching or 
post -docto ra I res e a r c h 
pOSitions or have fou nd 
sui table jobs off the cam-
puses. 

" The job situation is not 
too bad for graduate 
students from the 50 or so 
schools that make up the 
Association of Graduate 
Schools," Pearch said . 
" These are the schools, 
,uc h as Harvard , Yale, 
Michiga.n, and the UnIve rsi-
ty of CalifornIa, that have 
tr aditio nally given graduate 
dcg rees and now grant 
about 75 percent of all 
Ph . D.'s in the country each 
year. 

"The problem comes," 
he said, " from tho se 
chools that have begun to 

offer the Ph .D. only since 
the end of th e Second 
World War. Their student-
to-job ratio is down ." 

Pearce said the reason for 
the success of UCSD 
grad uate students in fin-
ding jobs is twofold . " First , 
of all it has to do with the 
kind and quality of Ph .D. 
ca ndidates that we turn out. 
Our graduate programs are 
innovative and offer a great 
deal of flexability . Our 
students do a good deal of 
work in related field s as 
well as deeply concen-
trating on a small area of 
study." 

" Secondly," he said , "i t 
has to do with the type of 
st udents we get. Our 
programs.a nd d epartments 
are well known and 
therefo re we get many 
more applicants than we 
Cdn accept. For thIS reason

now for minority ,tudent.,:' 
hI" ,a id. 

"The importJnt thing Ihat 
IS developing at UCSD," 
Pea rce saId, " is that our 
new d f>partmen ts are 
placi ng people. Our so ial 
science department are 
starting to produce Ph.D.'s 
with good results in the job 
market." 

The student job survey is 
designe d to h e lp the 
g raduate departm ents 
de ide on ' how many new 
students to take in each 
yea r." 

" We> base our graduate 
enro llment on s v ral 
things ; our strong commit -
ment 10 edu at ion, th style 
of tea hing in each 
graduate department, and 

the job market, " Pearc
