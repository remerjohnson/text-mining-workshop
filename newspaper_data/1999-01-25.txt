Researchers used digital 
cameras and other devices to 
determine the length of time 
customers waited in line at 
ATMs and what ATMs were 
used most frequently. The 
study pinpointed those

Cooling-Off 
Period Ended 
on Thursday 
DISCUSSION: Administration 
and student employees met four 
times; TAs may strike again 
By Vincent Gragnanl 
Senior Staff Writer 

The 45-day cooling-off period that put a 
hold on last month's teaching assistant strike 
ended last Thursday with both sides still at a 
stalemate. 

During the cooling-off period, representa-
tives from the University of California mel four 
times wilh representatives from Ihe United 
AulO Workers (UA W) - Ihe TA's union - a~ 
well as TAs from all UC undergraduate cam-
puses. 

In a letter released 10 Ihe universily commu-
nily last Thursday, UC President Richard 
Atkinson stated that while the series of talks 
"gave each party a better understanding of the 
other's concerns," the university will not recog-
nize TA unions. 

"After a thorough review of the UAW's 
demand to represent teaching assistants. the 
university's pOsition remains that collective 
bargaining for TAs is not in the educational 
interest of the university and its students, both 
undergraduate and graduate," Atkinson stated. 

A statement released last Thursday by the 
UAW stated that union members recessed last 
month's strike in order to resolve the issue of 
union recognition during the cooling-off peri-
od. 

"Union leaders agreed to recess a system-' 
wide strike by [Academic Student Employees) 
in a good faith commitment that talks during 
the cooling-off period might resolve the issue 
of recognition for UC teaching assistants," the 
UAW announcement stated. 

Because the issue of recognition was not 
resolved, Scott Prudham, a member of the 
Association of Graduate Student 
Employees/UAW at Berkeley, said that union 
members will resume their strike. 

"In response, we will be meeting with our 
members to determine the most effective time 
to resume our strike," Prudham said . 

Molly Rhodes, a representative of the 
ASElUAW in San Diego. said that union mem-
bers statewide will meet by next week to dis-
cuss the outcome of the talks and the future of 
the strike. 

Atkinson stated in his letter he was troubled 
by the fact that union members would not dis-
~uss specific issues during the cooling-off peri-
od unless they were first recognized as a union. 

"The university attempted during the talks to 
initiate a dialogue about the specific concerns 
of graduate students, in areas such as workload, 
pay and working conditions." Atkinson wrote. 
'The UAW stated it was not willing to discuss 
these matters unless it was acting as the exclu-
sive representative of teaching assistants." 

Rhodes said that she believed the legislators 
who initiated the cooling-off period intended it

A.S. Responds to 
Housing Report 
RESOwnON: A.S. Council statement says that 
UCSD should continue the use of temporary spaces 
By VIncent Greenanl 
Senior Staff Writer 

For the past two years during 
fall and winter quarters. UCSO has 
placed students in tl!mporary 
accommodation because the uni-
versity has enrolled more students 
than it has room to house. The A.S. 
Council passed a resolution on 
UCSO's housing shortage on Jan. 
6, in response to recommendations 
made by an administrative commit-
tee last fall. 

Because additional housing will 
not be available until 2002, Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs 
Steven Relyea and Vice Chancellor 
of Student Afl'airs Joseph Watson 
established a commillee last August 
to review and make rl!cnmmenda-
tions on housing-related issues. 

The commillee presented its 
findings to Relyea and Watson on 
Oct. 16 i I' last year. 

The comminee recommended 
that UCSD no longer offer housing 
tn new transfer students, freshmen 
who miss thl!ir deadlines and con-
tinuing students who do not have a 
housing guarantee. 

The comminee also recom-
mended that the university discon-
tinue the use of temporary spaces. 
In the past, temporary spaces have 
been created by housing an extra 
student within a residence hall 
room or apartment. Spaces were 
also crealed by converting rooms 
intended for student organizations 
into student housing. 

The recommendation stated that 
it is "unsell ling" tor students to be 
housed In temporary spaces 

because they are never sure when 
they will have to move into a per-
manent space. It also stated that 
temporary housing nlises the densi-
ty of students in a given area, which 
increases the number of student 
conflicts. 

A.S. President Joe Leventhal 
said he submitted a resolution to 
the A.S. Council regarding the 
commillee's recommendations 
because he fell that UCSO could 
improve its use of current 
resources, especially in helping 
transfer students. 

"I had seen ' the recommenda-
tions ... and I felt that transfer stu-
dents were being completely 
neglected in the proposed changes," • 
Leventhal said. "I felt it was impor-
tant to try and articulate what the 
students saw as a better use of the 
resourees the school has." 

The A.S. resolution states that it 
docs not support the discontinua-
tion of temporary spaces because 
temporary spaces are more desir-
able to most students than off-cam-
pus housing options. 

"Be it resolved that the 
ASUCSD does not support recom-
mendation J, the discontinuation of 
temporary spaces, as many stu-
dents, including transfers, are quite 
satisfied with temporary spaces as 
opposed to off-campus spaces," the 
resolution stated. 

Levenlhal said that while he 
docs not support convening Mudent 
organization rooms into living 
quarters for students, he does favor 
the creation of temporary spaces by

to be a time when the two groups 
could discuss union recognition. 
not specific working conditions. 

"The point of the talks was to 
discuss TA recognition and resolv-
ing the issues that led to the strike," 
Rhodes said. 'That is what we were 
interested in doing." 

Last month, the state Public 
Employment Relations Board 
(PERB), ruled in a case concerning 
UCLA that teaching assistants are 
eligible for collective bargaining. 

While this ruling is consistent 
with a 1996 ruling by PERB Judge 
James Tamm, it connicts with a 
1992 ruling by the state Court of 
Appeals regarding TAs at UC 
Berkeley. 

Atkinson said that because of 
the connict witb the 1992 ruling, 
the university has asked for a new 
court review of the UCLA case. 

"The university bel1eves that a 
new court review of these issues is 
necessary," Atkinson stated in his 
leiter. "We are seeking that review,

get students involved," Mendez 
said. 

UCSD Assistant Athletic 
Dim:tor Ken Gross echoed her sen-
timent. 

"When the colleges get behind 
it, anything is possible," he said. 

Throughout the game, fans 
yelled and cheered. Marshall 
College erected a IO-foot tinfoil 
Triton that stood in the comer of 
the court. Wanen College students 
placed yellow paper slugs on the 
end of tridents to show Triton spir-
it. The colleges also decorated their 
sections with posters that encour-
aged the basketball team to "salt 
the slugs." 

These decorations, along with 
the college's game attendance, spir-
it, decorations on the college cam-
pus and performance in a halftime 
competition, were the basis for 
deciding which college won the 
Spirit Trophy. 

In the halftime event, partICI-
pants from each college had to

process will produce • result that is 
consistent with the university'S 
educational mission." 

UCSD Labor Relations Director 
Michael Melman said that the uni-
versity will continue to follow the 
1992 Court of Appeals ruling until 
the differences between the PERB 
and the court are resolved. 

"We have a decision from the 
Court of Appeals (concerningjthe 
Berkeley campus where they ... 
indicated that TAs ... were not eli-
gible for collective bargaining," 
Melman said_ "We are asking the 
PERB to join with the university 
and certify the board's decision to 
the Court of Appeals." 

Rhodes said that she believes it • 
is not an issue of two separate and 
contlicting rulings; rather, that the 
more recent PERB ruling over-
turned the older Court of Appeals 
ruling. 

"The UCLA decision specifical-
ly addressed the points in the 
Berkeley decision and overturned 
them," Rhodes said. 

In a Dec. 2 leiter to Atkinson, 
California State Senate President 
Pro Tern John Burton and 
Assembly Speaker Antonio

empty chair at half court, with one 
chair removed each round to elimi-

event. 

Every college filled up its sec-
tion of the arena with attendees. 
Muir College filled up its bleacher 
section and overflowed into other 
sections and the concourse around 
the arena. 

In the competition for the tro-
phy, Wanen College came in fifth 
place, Roosevelt College and 
Revelle College tied for third place, 
and Marshall Collet!e fiRished in 
second place. 

In addition. attendants of the 
game participated in the Student

all fans received free tickets when 
they entered RIMAC Arena. The 
prizes from the raffle ranged from 
certificates for "alifomia Pizza

"It is disingenuous to rely on 
an outdated Berkeley ruling,

ter stated. "The more recent rul-
ings are in favor of recognition for

'The UAW said in their statement 
that the PERB has recently ordered 
a representation election to be held 
March 9-11, 1999 for academic stu-

election would give TAs the right to 
choose whether they want to be rep-
resented by the UA W. 

Rhodes said that the UAW feels 
that TAs at all UC campuses are 
eligible for union representation. 

"It is our position that TAs at 
UCSD and at UCs across the sys-
tem do the same work as TAs at 
UCLA and' should have the same 
right to a union representation elec-

Spirit Night encouraged stu-

Roosevelt sophomore Vera Irani

lacking." 

Warren sophomore Leo

ments_ 

"A social event is just that - it 
is in no way a reneetion of the gen-
erai atmosphere on campus," 
Tverskoy said. "Having one so-
called 'Spirit Night' doesn ' t change 
much." 

However, Gross also said he 
hopes Spirit Night encouraged stu-
dents to attend more athletic 
events. 

"I hope the experience tonight 
will get students enthusiastic to 
come out more," Gross said. 

On Saturday, a ceremony was

OPINION 
LEVELLING THE 

By Jeffrey M. Barker 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Nobody is arguing against diversity on 
University of Califomia campuses. However. 
people are arguing. 

The affirmative a~tion debate is alive and 
kicking and is being poked and prodded by 
the UC Regents. During their January meet-
ing, some regents hinted of a possible repeal 
of their 1995 ban on affirmative action prac-
tices, reported the Los Angeles Times. 
Though it would only be a symbolic gesture 
- California's Proposition 209 takes prece-
dence over any Board of Regents decision _ 
the proposed reintroduction of allirmative 
action is sure to call protesters into action 
and to cause more arguing. 

A symbolic repeal of the UC affirmative 
action ban is a sman public relations move on 
the pan of the regents. Moreso. it is a sman stu-
dent relations decision. Such an act, however, 
d<x:s nothing to address the diversity prohlem 
plaguing University of California campuses. 
Instead, it will only add fuel to an existing 
inlerno of student and faculty protesters, whose 
actions have brought increased nll;ial division 
on the San Diego campus. 

The UC Regents need to make a move that 

separates the issue of diversity from the idea 
of ethnicity. The multitude of outreach pro-
grams and methods the University of 
California is currently using to circumvent 
Proposition 209 need to focus on educational 
deliciem;y rather than on ethnicity. 

A diverse learning environment cannot be 
narrowly' deli ned as one with a mixture of 
ethnicities proportionate to that found in 
California. Racial diversity is but one aspect 
of many that should he considered when dis-
cussing the diversity of a community. 

The goal of diversity on a university cam-
pus is an educational one; students and facul-
ty of varied backgrounds will present varied 
ideas and varied points of view - the end 
result being a rounder, more enriching, more 
informative learning environment. A program 
capable of producing such an environment 
deals with a combination of regional diversi-
ty. economic diversity, diversity of religion. 
and a handful of other categories into which 
we fall that make us unique from one another 
- racial diversity being but one of them. 

It is. however, this racial diversity that we 
focus on. And concentrating on issues of race 
and ethnicity touches us all like a branding 
iron to the heart . There is no escaping the 

emotions that come with separating us 
into categories based on ethnicity, 

because we all have our own skin 
color and country of origin and 

can, therefore, be catego-
rized and unnec-

essarily split 
away from 

our peers. 

Josephine Roberts/Guardian 

1be emotion that accompanies 

issues concerning race is, 

dividing the UCSD campus. 

To combat this and promote 

diversity, affirmative action 
practices should focus on 
educational opportunity rather 

than on ethnicity. 
Californians are so starkly divided when it 
comes to issues of race that Proposition 209 
passed with just 54 percent approval. 

On campus, this divide has revealed itself 
in both tears and in hateful words. A speaker 
at lall quarter's rally remembering Matthew 
Shepard singled out white males as the evil in 
the crowd. One group, marching on campus 
in support of racial preferences, spoke of the 
proverbial "white man." Fall quarter saw the 
appearance of swastikas on campus. 
Caucasian students express concern that their 
chances of gelling into a UC school are 
decreasing. Students searching for seats in 

lectu~ halls - whether conscious of their 
actions or not - gravitate toward other stu-
dents with like skin colors. 

While it is true that racial diversity at UCSD 
needs balancing, it is only pan of the whole 
idea of diversity and does not deserve of the 
trouble-making reputation it has developed. 

The balancing of ethnicities is being done 
by the University of Califomill in the fonn of 
outreach programs, such as partnerships with 
high schools and numerous recruitment 
efforts. Applications for the fall quarter of 
[999 at UCSD from Latinos have increased 
by 28.8 percent from last year. There is also 
an 11 .2 percent increase in the number of 
African American applicants. 

Matter of factly, it is wrong for an edu-
cational institution to discriminate based 
on ethnicity, yearly income, religion, hair 
color, politica[ affiliation, or where an 
applicant lives. The only criteria on 
which a university can justly base its 
discrimination of an applicant is edu-

cation. Grades, test scores and 
coursework can be the only fair 

and unemotional detenninants of 
a student's qualifications. 

While our studenl and faculty

population at UCSD must be varied 
and colorful concerning race, rcli-
gion, musical taste and money in 
their pockets, we must all be. more 
or less. homogeneous in the catego-
ry of academic excellence. 

Alier all, proponents of atlinna-
tive action claim that African 
American and Latino students arc 
not given .. through their puhlic 
schools. the same educational tools 
and opponunities as other students. 
Money may not be pumped into 
schools in poor neighborhoods and 
teachers there may not be the best. It 
seems then, that the ailment these 
racial preferences are altempting to 
cure is an uneven educational playing 
field; applicants to the University of 
California may not all be equipped 
with the same opportunities to prove 
their worth and potential. 

And while lines dividing us by 
the quality of our high school and 
grade school experiences may be 
drawn very simi[arly to lines delin-
ing us by skin color, delermining 
our potential based on our educa-
tion takes away the emotion caus-
ing rifts in our community. 

It's not that attempts to balance 
UCSD's ethnic pie chart aren't 
admirable -they are. But the man-
ner of that balancing - to again 
mete out disproportionate opportu-
nities and preferences based on our 
ethnicity - causes an unrest in our 
community, the hannful ellects of 
which may outweigh the benefits of 
a balanced student population. 

To examine an applicant's past 
education rather than their country 
of origin addresses the problem 
that, perhaps, African Americans 
and Latinos are not afforded the 
same opportunities as Caucasians. 
Shifting the focus of affirmative 
action to educational discrepancies 
between applicants is a move 
toward solving the problem of a 
non-diverse campus. Allowing 
preferences based on ethnicity is 
just a bunch of duct tape hopi ng for 
someone else to come along with 
nails and wood glue - a quick lix 
waiting for a real solution. 

In addition to tossing around the 
idea of a silly public relations 
repeal of their affirmative action 
ban. the regents discussed 
increased focus on teacher training. 
One regent hopes to double the 
number of UC-trained teachers. 
Gov. Davis has already approved 
three programs that move toward 
this goal. The regents should be 
applauded for this elTort; better 
teachers in California schools will 
level the currently uneven playing 
field that is causing an imbalance 
of ethnicities on UC campuses. 

Concerning aflinnative action, 
the UC Regents sliou[d make strides 
to remove the emotional category of 
race .from any of their decisions. 
Dividing and categorizing students 
based on race when the problem is 
one based on education does noth-
ing to improve the learning environ-
ment on a university campus, it only 
makes more visible the divides. The 
goal of a rich and djo,.erse education 
and campus is much broader than 
the incendiary issue of race.

A.S.: Temporary

needed next year 
ContInued frOlll ..... 1 

dents not guaranteed housing. 
Leventhal said that a lottery system 
would give transfer students more 
of an opportunity to receive on-
campus housing. 

Both the A.S. resolution and the 
lindings of the committee ~tate that 
resources should be allocated to help 
tr.lOsfer students become integrated 
with their colleges and with the aca-
demic community as a whole. 

LIGHTS IRENS 
adding students to existing rooms, 
as long as everyone involved agrees 
to the situation. 

"All students who are going to 
he sharing the room "need to have 
agreed to want that space," 
Leventhal said. "It really doesn't 
impact people outside of those who 
want the temporary space." 

Larry Barrett, director of the 
Housing and Dining Services 
Administration and chair of the 
Committee on Housing Procedures. 
said that most transfer students 
would prefer off-campus housing 
rather than temporary on-campus 
housing. 

"I am sure there are some tr.msfer 
students who Illay take a temporary 
space, but experience has shown that 
tmnsfer students would rather live 
otl~calllpus than live in a residence 
hall or temporary space." Barrell said. 

Barrett added that evt!n though 
transfer students would no longer be 
guaranteed housing, temporary 
spaces may still be needed next year 
to accommodate new freshmen and 
continuing sophomore students. 

"Based on enrollments, we may 
not even have enough housing for 
the new students and the continuing 
students with the guarantee," Barrell 
said. "If this happens, we may have 
to again provide temporary spaces to 
honor our guarantee commitment." 

The A.S. resolution also calls 
for the use of a lottery instead of a 
waiting list for students who miss 
the deadlines and for transfer stu-

The committee also said that 
housing brochures should be sent 
to students along with the admis-
sions packet because, in the past, 
some students and parents have 
said that they did not receive the 
housing information when it was 
sent separately to them. 

The committee also recom-
mended that the housing brochures 
be reviewed to ensure that parents 
and students are' fully aware of the 
housing process. Althougfi such 
information is already included, the 
committee argued that the brochure 
needs to have a "reality focus" 
rather than a "marketing focus." 

Barrell said that the findings of 
the committee are being imple-
mented. 

Leventhal said that while the 
A.S. resolution alone probably will 
not change the situation, a greater 
voice from the students may affect 
the decision process. 

"If this [the A.S. resolution] 
isn't the only statement that stu-
dents make on the issue, then this 
resolution may have an impact," 
Leventhal said. 

Barrell said that student concerns 
regarding housing may be sent to 
him via e-mail, adding that he would 
pass those concems on to the com-
millee members.

With the Y2K barrier only a few 
months off, people all over the 

world should prepare themselves 
. for the excitement of the 

destruction of all humanity 
his is it folks. Withdraw your money 
from the bank, let your magazine sub-
scriptions run out. call up your loved 
ones and wish them luck in the afterlife. 
From the moment you stan reading this 
anicle, you have about 340 days (and a 
few shon hours) to enjoy the rest of 
your life. 

That's right, millions of years of human evolu-
tion and thousands of years of recorded history 
will come to a grinding halt this December, as the 
Earth shares one final dance with the human race 
before sending us all off into oblivipn. So if the 
Judgment Day is right around the comer, we as a 
society should take steps to make it a positive 
experience. 

Now, in case you are not acquainted with all the 
details, the Guardian is here to lend its 
omnipresent hand. Let us first consider the date. 
Everybody with a belief system and a secret code 
book have calculated which day will be our last 
and, big surprise, they're all different. 

So for the purpose of this less-than-"scientifi-
cally accurate"look at Doomsday, let's stick to 12 
a.m., Jan. 1,2000 for humanity's last hour. Every-
body likes big, round numbers when it comes to 
the global annihilation of every man. woman and 
child. 

That's it then, a little over! I months before the 
end of all things. Now that the date has been estab-
lished, let's examine what forms these apocalyptic 
events might take. 

When a computer is asked to sean;h the intemet

THE END: 
Millennium will 
bring destruction 
Contln.ed ...... ...,. 7 
which beautifully illustrate our 
grim demise. tons of completely 
unrelated nonsense and a number 
of possible fates for our little blue-
green planet. 

For example, last spring 
astronomer Brian Marsden 
announced that an asteroid at least 
a mile WIde could pass within 
30,000 miles of Earth in about 30 
years. A day later, NASA 
researchers claimed that the ' roid 
would miss us by 600,000 miles. 
Was this simply a big hoax by Mr. 
Marsden or a top· level government 
cover-up'! We may not know until 
2028, when CNN reports the mys· 
terious explosion of the moon. 

The point is that there are mil-
lions of celestial bodies with the 
potential to inflict widespread "bad 
hair day" syndrome for the people 
of Earth. If one of these fireballs of 
doom were coming straight for us, 
the odds are against the president 
making that knowledge public. 

Fortunately for humanity we've 
got the Atari 2600 video game sys-
tem. This little piece of technology 
spawned a generation of slack· 
jawed, but highly skilled, asteroid· 
shattering soldiers, And maybe I've 
seen too many movies. but I'd like 
to think that if the planet really 
were threatened by big falling 
rocks, Bruce Willis would be at 
hand to lead a platoon of joystick-
proficient computer nerds into 
space to shoot them down. 

So we're good on the asteroid 
issue. However, the concept of 
believing in Doomsday leads 
directly into the subject of self· 
annihilation - yes, global ther-
monuclear war. Everyone knows 
that the policy of "they have theirs 
so we have ours" only works so 
long as "we" and "they" have 
enough food. gasoline and HBO,

Of course. we may not even 
need to push the button ourselves. 
From all the indications our cut· 
ting-edge media have provided, it 
sounds as though every single 
machine with Interrw Inside is 
going to short circuit big-time in 
the Y2K - and not in that robot-
gets·hit-by lightning. evolves-into· 
lovable·wisecracking-sidekick

Let's face it , the worst that can 
happen when the big hand sweeps 
past the 12 next New Year's Eve 
and every computer on the planet 
stans singing, "Daisy, Daisy. give

The UCSD Guardian 

the next morning. No great loss to 
humanity there. 

Many people are planning on 
packing a two·week picnic basket 
and driving into the Ozarks to 
escape the inevitable rioting and 
mass destruction that will result 
from the Y2K bug. Here is why 
that's just silly. Firsl off, we're not 
cave people, we don't need to nee 
into the mountains at the first sign 
of danger. Second, there's not 
going to be any riots unless the 
processors in our brains can't add a 
one to 1999 without gelling 1900, 

The buses will still come on 
time. your car will still start and 
winter quarter will still hegin on the 
following Monday, There will still 
be plenty of toilets to puke the pre-
vious evening's booze into and the 
sun will still rise. 

As for me, I'll be in the heart of 
New York City's Times Square 
with body armor, M&M's (the offi-
cial candy of Ihe new millennium) 
and noise·makers, because a 
quadruple·digit rollover dop.sn't 
come around in just any lifetime, If 
we can't celebrate our planet zip-
ping around in a circle 2,000 times 
without crashing into the sun then 
what can we'! 

I feel tine aboul the end of the 
world as we know it. It 's going to 
be a big, global pany, celebrating 
2,000 years of humanity - not the 
disastrous calamity that everyone 
from religious extremists to 
COBOL-coding nerds are making 
it out to be. 

So once we've moved beyond 
the 1900s and we're basking in the 
eve of the new millennium, remem-
ber what has been discussed. Bruce 
and his army of 'roid-blasting 
nerds can neutralize any celestial 
threats, biblical prophecies haven'l 
reared their seven seals our way 
yet, nuclear annihilation is never a 
threat until we lose our MTV and 
the Y2K bug would have to literal-
ly be a giant, killer robo-insecl to 
innict ' the amount of damage 
they're predicting,

MEGAN SMITH 
Managing Editor 

I finally did it. I finally took the 
trip that is a requirement for every 
college student. Over winter break. 
my husband, Mark. and I joined 
our good friend Clint on a cross-
country road trip. 

Clint had just finished his final 
quarter here at UCSD last fall. and 
he had enrolled in the UCDC pro-
grolm for winter and spring quarters 
to finish up his UCSD career. Clint 
had to be in Washington on the sec-
ond of January, so we had one 
week to get from Clint's sunny 
home in Anaheim Hills to his new 
home in freezing cold Washington. 
D,C. 

We woke up bright and early on 
Sunday morning, the 27th of 
December. It was the day of our 
departure. and we were ready for 
whatever challenges awaited us on 
the road ahead. But before we 
could even travel an inch, we had to 
overcome our first challenge: pack-
ing the car. 

Trying to move your entire life 
from one side of the country to 
another in a car is difficult, espe-

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES II 

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
The trials and tribulations ... of what? Yes, it's a road triP! 

cially when you have two passen-
gers with you. We shoved suitcases. 
pushed packages and crammed car-
tons until everything fit in the back 
of Clint's Jeep. Then we discovered 
that you couldn't see anything out 
the back window while silling in 
the driver's seat. We moved things 
back and fonh and shoved and 
crammed some more. but the best 
we could do was open up a small 
area of the back window that (as 
luck would have it) just happened 
to be covered hy a UCSD sticker. 
We gave up and got on the road. 
.,., .... 

Our first day of traveling took 
us on the 10 east from Anaheim 
Hills, through the desen and a,ross 
the border into Arizona. We made 
it to Phoenix as the sun was selling 

. and decided to continue on to Tuc-
son. 

We ate dinner in the only Chi-
nese restaurant in Tucson. and then 
decided to stay in the Hotel Con-
gress. a historical hotel in the mid-
dle of downtown recommended by 
our waitress. After being accosted 
by a few homeless guys, we 
checked in for the night ... and 
wouldn't you know it. our room 
was located directly over the 
hotel's nightclub! The salsa music 
shook the room until one in the 
morning. And what a room it was. 
About the size of a large closet, the 
furniture consisted of a really 
comfy chair, a dresser and bunk 
beds. Did you hear that'! BUNK 

BEDS! For three people! We ended 
up throwing the mattresses on the 
floor and falling asleep to the 
throbbing music. 
.,.,"'-

We woke up early on day two 
and high-tailed it out of Tucson, 
Our goal that day'! San Antonio, a 
5I:ant956 miles away. Our first stop 
was at "The Thing: Mystery of the 
Dcsen!" about an hour down the 
road in the middle of nowhere. For 
hreakfast we had everything from 
hash browns that literally poured 
out grease to a Nulty BUllerfinger 
Blizzard from Dairy Queen, By the 
way, Dairy Queen is not the place 
to go when you want a good break-
fast. 

Mark was plagued by a sore 
throat and a cough. so Clint and I 
decided to go explore 'The Thing!" 
while Mark stayed at Dairy Queen 
with a cup of hot chocolate. We 
wandered into the building and dis-
covered it was a giant gift shop. On 
the back wall was a door that 
tempted 'The Thing: Mystery of 
the Desen! Adults - 75 cents, 
Children - SO cents." Clint and I 
decided it would be beller if we 
made it a point to not see "The 
Thing!" Instead. we bought "The 
Thing!" souvenirs and piled back 
into the car. 

Our next stop was for gas in Las 
Cruces. N.M., where we di5l:0v-
ered the slowest gas pump on the 
entire planet (it took us 20 minutes 
to pump I S gallons of gas). After 

our pit stop. we decided to get hard 
core. We drove straight to a hotel 
just outside of San Antonio, stop-
ping only for gas, It was our 
longest drive. Clint drove the entire 
way. covering a third of the country 
in one day. 
.,., ............ Four 

We spent a few hours of day 
three in San Antonio. wandering 
around the river walk and the 
Alamo, and then drove for two 
hours that evening to stay with 
Clint's relatives in Houston. 

The next day (day four) we were 
on the road at ten, heading toward 
New Orleans: We planned to stay 
for a few nights there, but had yet 
to secure a hotel reservation. We 
were gelling a lillie worried, but 
figured we would be fine. 

Upon arriving in New Orleans, 
we realized it didn't really mailer 
that we had no reservations, 
because it was so crowded, diny 
and smelly that we didn't want to 
stay there. I had been in New 
Orleans a few years back, but I did-
n't remember it being so awful. We 
picked up an early dinner at a 
Cajun restaurant, and then spentt~e 
rest of the evening wandering 
around the casinos in Biloxi, Miss., 
about an hour away. 
All ........ of .... .,.,. 

Since it looks like I am running 
out of room. I will just throw out a 
few highlights of the last half of our 
trip. 

Highlight One: We got to tour 

an alligator farm on the border of 
Mississippi and Alabama. The 
three great tINngs about this were, 
first, that our hoat almost broke 
down in the middle of the swamp, 
second, that our tour guide had the 
thickest southern a,cent ever. and 
third, I got to hold a baby alliga-
tor. 

Highlight Two: In Jacksonville. 
we stopped going east on the 10 
and staned going nonh on the 95. 
We only took two highways the 
entire trip. Can you believe that'! 

Highlight Three: Our New 
Year's Eve was spent in a hotel 
room just outside of Savannah, Ga. 
We had just barely checked in 
before midnight. snapped on the 
TV, counted down and .. . that was 
that. We didn't really care that it 
was New Year's, I guess this isn 't 
the most exciting highlight. 

Highlight Four: We finally got 
to eat at a Warne House. This is a 
very popular restaurant chain on 
the east coast (you see them every-
where), and we finally broke down 
and ate at one. (The ham and 
cheese omelet with hash browns 
was prelty good.) 

Highlight Five: We made it to 
Washington, visited all the tourist 
spots and enjoyed a Sunday after-
noon eating UNO's pizza and 
watching the Niners' game (which 
was a really good game.) 

Highlight Six: This is the end of 
my soapbox. you don 't have to read 
it anymore!

In this column, I shall discuss all of 
the fascinating details of love and 
romance. And since I'm often told 
that Psycho Therapy is too female-
centric. my next several columns 
will focus on guys! 

Today. we will examine the 
lives of six UCSD men: Dave.

Dave: I couldn't date someone 
wlio had a lame personality. But if 
she weighed 5.000 pounds, we'd 
probably just be friends because I 
wouldn't be allracted to her. But 
usually. the more I know a girl. 
the more ultraclivc she seems to 
me. 

The Dawg: Probably the one 
with the personality. The first thing 
I notice is the looks, but after I start 
talking LO them. I like a sense of

Lobo: That depends on how 
good-looking she is. If she's really 
fucking gorgeous but has a totally 
worthless personality. I could go 
for four months in the relationship. 
That 's a rough estimate. 

Sven: You need to have a lillie 
bit of ooth. I'd say personality is 
dominant. 

Arturo: I would frolic for 24 
hours with the beautifui woman. 
then marry the one with personali-
ty - because she is beautiful in the 
only way that mailers. Wait. don't 

skydiving or anything because you 
don't want to crap your pants on 
the first date. 

Arturo: I'd stuff a live carp 
down my pants and jump around 
like a maniac. Wait . don't write that

someone, you learn ahead of time 
to put up with whatever her past 
is.

Dave: That they all wanted me! 
Umm ... maybe they care too much 
about their appearance. That's not 
necessarily a bad thing, but I hate it 
when girls cake on the makeup. I 
think girls look beller without their 
makeup. 

The Dawg: Why do they get so emotional about some 
things? Little things, like they put on a few pounds or 

something, or they got a bad grade on their test. And I still 
don 't understand why girls go to the bathroom in groups.

intelligent. OK, looks fade and 
plastic surgery only goes so far, but 
personality lasts forever. 

Bob: I'm thinking .. ..

Dave: Uhh ... good question. 
I'm pretty shy. I'm definilely shy 
around girls. If I'm going to ask a 
girl out, I'd want to know for sure 
that she'd say yes. 

The Dawg: I would call her up 
and try to spend time with her. I 
would ask her out. 

Lobo: I talk to her, sit next to 
her. hang around outside her bed· 
room window. But if you show too 
much interest. then ii's over. 

Sven: Usually. they have a 
boyfriend ... but in the off-chance 
that they 're single. I ask them out to 
dinner or something boring. Not 

friends with a variety of experi-
ences. 

The Dawg: Umm ... well the girl 
I was dating last time told me about 
her past, and it was something I 
wouldn't have expected. But it did-
n't stop me from seeing her. 

Lobo: Yeah. I care. It's not a 
deal-breaker, but slulliness would 
bother me. The other way isn't 
cool, either. 

Sven: Cd be lying if I said it did-
n't affect me. Feelings aside, if 
she'd slept with a lot of people, it 
would make me a lillie worried 
about my health. It would definite-
ly be a tum-on'. If she'd never slept 
with anyone. that would be weird. 
too ... usually you try and shoot for 
someone in the middle.

what's past is past. By and large, I

Tritons Struggle UCSD Saltsthe'Slugs 
ERRORS: Poor hitting hurts Tritons in recent loss SEASONED: Strong shooting aids the Tritons paSt uc Santa Cruz, 70-40 
., ...... 
Senior Staff ~er 

Mama said that there would be 
days like this, but that doesn't make 
the Men's Vollcyballteam feel any 
beller about its game on 
Saturday against Cal 
S tat e 
Northridge. 

After a 
solid performance 
against the University of 
Southern California Trojans 
lasl Tuesday, the Tritons came OUI 
and didn't execute against 
Northridge. They eventually fell 
in a match that can only be 
described as disappointing . 
Ahho':lgh they had some streaks 
where they played up to their abil-
ity, inconsistency killed the 
Tritons leading them to a 2-15, 9-
IS, 4-15 loss. 

Game one was more of a blur 
than anything else. Although the 
Tritons were able to keep most of 
their serves in play. a problem that 
has plagued them throughout the 
season, they were unable to put the 
points away. 

Collectively, UCSD managed 
just 6 kills against 8 hilling errors 
and had a difficult time hilling 
around the Northridge block, which 
included a 6-foot-IO-inch middle 
blocker. The Tritons' offensive 
problems were compounded by the 
fact that the Matadors seemed to be 
hilling everything into the ground. 
The Northridge anack was on fire in 
game one, tallying 10 kills and only 
I hilling error. 

Things got considerably better 
for UCSD in game two. The score 
stayed at 5-8 for 10 consecutive 
sidcouts before Sophomore Zack 
Hite's service ace pulled the 

Tritons within 2 points of the 
Matadors. The momentum seemed 
to be swinging toward . UCSD's 
side. but the Matadors quickly took 
it back with 3 quick points, pulling 

the Tritons back down by 5. 
The Tritons then got those 

3 points right back, 
helped by an ace 
from Kaeo Griffin 

at ill. Though UCSD nar-
rowed the gap to 9-11, they 

could not get the upper hand and 
Nonhridge went on to take game 
two, 15-9. • 

Game three was shaping up early 
to be a war between the Matadors 
and the Tritons. Northridge took a 
quick 3-1 lead before UCSD 
Slonned back to lead 4-3. 

Unfortunately. the Tritons errors 
began 10 get the beller of them at 
that point. The score stayed at 4-6 
for 10 consecutive sidcouts before 
Northridge finally broke through 
with a kill. Losing that point 
seemed to take the wind out of the 
Tritons as they never again mount-
ed a significant challenge and lost 
the nexi eight points and the game 
by the score of 4-15. 

Hite led the Tritons with 12 ki lis 
and a pair of service aces. Devon 
Jeffcoat made the moSi of his hit-
ting opportunities, chipping in with 
7 kills against only 4 errors. Seller 
Kurt Seckington tallied I . kill and 
22 assists. 

With this loss the Tritons record 
falls to 1-5 and 0-5 in the treacher-
ous Mount Pacific Sports 
Federation. UCSD plays next on 
Tuesday when they head up the 1·5 
to take on Long Beach State before 
returning home to play East Coast 
power Princeton University on 
Saturday at RIMAC.

Sports Editor 

With juSi over a month to go 
before round one of the women's 
NCAA Division III tournament. 
the Tritons are right on track. 
Though their Sian was shaky and 
riddled with tumovers and sub-par 
shooting, their play of late has been 
nothing but solid and confident. 

This week, the Tritons began 
their two-week long road trip in 
which they will play five games 
up and down the coast. On 
Saturday night, the Tritons were in 
the Monterey Bay area to take on 
the UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs. 
UCSD had no trouble handling 
the Slugs, as they won 70-40. 

Like their male counterpans, the 
"Bomb Squad," the women have 
lived on the outside shot all season 
long. On Saturt!ay, twenty-one of 
the Tritons' 70 points came from 
outside the three-point line. Senior 
guard TriSien Teasdale, who led 
UCSD with 17 points, had 3 three-
pointers. 

Saturday night's game had 
another crucial similarity between 
the one played by the men on 
Friday night: it was never close. 
The Tritons were up 32-15 at the 
half, and sunk bucket after bucket 
in the second half. 

While UCSD was strong offen-
sively, they also showed some tire 
defensively. Senior forward Kate 
Turnbull showed her strong pres-
ence in the paint as she came 
down with a team-best II 
rebounds. Turnbull also had 3 
steals. 4 assists and II points to go 
along with her boards. 

The Tritons, now 12-5 on the 
season, have been rolling lately, 
winning eight of their last nine

o.t8Ide: UCSD reserve Tessa Guy tests her outside shot. 
Lately, the Tritons have been sinking most of their jumpshots. 
contests. They are turning the ball 
over fewer times per game, and 
their percentage from the floor has 
been increasing every game. 

In UCSD's Nov. 20 season-
opening loss to the University of 
St. Thomas (Minn.), the Tritons 
shot a miserable 33 percent from 
the 1100r. They also turned the ball 
over 33 times. In their latest win 

however, the Tritons drained 45 
percent of their jumpshots, includ-
ing 7-16 from behind the arc. 

The Tritons' improvement has-
n't come along in leaps and 
bounds. It has been a methodical 
march towards consistency. If this 
march continues, the Tritons will 
surely be on their way to greatness 
as the post-season approaches.

Thc unprecedented numher of 
Trllon lam, who showed up for the has-
kClball game ,hallered the old single-game 
allendance record by more than 1.500 peo· 
plo.:. 

While Trllon basketball rans exceeded 
all expeclations by comi ng in droves on 
"SPirit ighl," the UCSD men 's basketball 
learn ha, been exceeding expeclations all 
,cason. Friday 's game was no exception. 
Fired up by the intensity am! exci temenl of 
Ihe cnormous crowd. UCS D dc"royed UC 
Sanla Cruz 114·74. raising thei r record to 
17-2 for the season. 

The game was never in doubt. TI)e" 
Tritons jumped out of the gate very quickly 
and maintai ned Ihe lead for the entire 
course of the game. Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier's squad used a 10lal team effort to 
pUI on a show for the masses. 

Seven Tritons recorded double figures 
in scoring with every player on the bench 
racking up at least two points. Senior for· 
wards Mike Wall and Joel Foote led the 
way with 17 points apiece, while point 
guard Tyler Garratt added 16 points of his 
own. Starting center Michael McMillan led 
the team with 8 rebounds. while reserve 
center Ahmad Russ picked up 7 boards to 
go along with his 10 points. 

In usual "Bomb Squad':. fashion, the 
Triton, managed a better percentage from the 
outside than from the floor. UCSD shot 56 
percent from behind the three· point line con· 
necting on 19 of 34 attempts. Backup point 
guard Nick Christiansen was a per1'ect 4·4 
from behind the arc. while senior Nick 
Maroutsos added' 3 more three pointers. 
Maroutsos and starting forward Sam Higgins 
both led the Tritons with tive assists. 

The UCSD defense excelled as well , 
holding the Banana Slugs to 39 percent 
shooti ng from the floor. 

The electricity in the air was palpable 

Icd1llical roul ror calli ng a lime-
OUI Ihal hi S leam did nOI have. Wilh 

Ihe oppm,ing leam in di,array, Ihe 
TrilOn, had an ea,y lime winning Ihe viclQ· 
ry and cou ld appreciale Ibe packed arena. 

" /1 was lOis of fun," Lanlhier said. 
"Hopefully Ihe crowd enjoyed Ihe basket· 
ball we played and everyone wi ll want to 
come back." 

Lanthier's biggest problem wilh the 
team may be deciding who to play, because 
everyone who comes into the game has per-
formed at a high leve l. 

; ; Since we haven 't played real competi-
ion in a long time, everyone's been getting 

lots of minutes." Lanthier said. "Yet every· 
one who's come off our bench has played 
so well. With two tough road games com· 
ing up, it's impossible for everyone to get 
substantial playing time." 

Those next two are road games against 
Chapman University and Christian Heritage 
College, two perennial Triton-killers. 
UCSD has to keeping its winning ways 
alive if it wants to go to the postseason. 

A loss on the road could be devastating to 
the Tritons who were tied for fifth in the most 
recent Division III Western Rankings on Jan. 
19. Only the top six teams from the West 
region make the NCAA playoffs, but UCSD 
has to keep winning to keep its position. 

"We just have to win our games," 
Lanthier said. "I still believe that if we get 
to 21·4 we wi II get in, but nothing is guar· 
anteed yet." 

Whatever the n.sult of this season, the 
game against Santa Cruz will be remembered 
in UCSD sports lore. Everyone who was 
there will never forget the excitement and the 
feeling of a rcal college basketball game. 
Therc is only one way to sum it up: 3,713.
