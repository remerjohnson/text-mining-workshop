Staff Phone Lines 
DA VIS - Several of UC 
Davis' top administrators will 
answer phone calls from 
students, faculty, staff and the 
community April 19. "It's an ' 
effort to make the chancellor, 
vice chancellor and deans 
more accessible to people," 
said Mafil Stratton, director of

activity is an opportunity to 
gauge campus climate and 
allow administrators and 
students to be honest and open

LOS ANGELES - The

met last Friday to decide how 
to deal with an anticipated

Measures discussed included 
food-service price increases 
and employee lay<1ffs. 
Chancellor Charles Young, 
who is required to intervene if 
the normally autonomous 
association becomes insol-
vent, said at a press confer-
ence Wednesday that he will 
not do so at this time. 

TAs Denied Union 
Recognition 
LOS ANGELES - UCLA 
teaching assistants held classes 
and office hours outside last 
week in a "non-militant" 
demonstration protesting the 
univer ity 's refusal to 
recognize the graduate student 
union. Leaders of the Student 
Association of Graduate 
Employees said the demon-
stration publicized their cause 
without interfering with 
undergraduates ' study. In 
response to the "teach-out" 
university officials issued a 
statement which denied the 
unions legitimacy because it 
would "run contrary to the 
promotion of academic 
excellence in the university'S 
graduate programs." "If their 
activities escalated to the point 
where it was interrupting 
education, we 'd have to take 
action," said Associate Dean 
of Graduate Student Kathleen 
Komar.

Judge Blocks Prop. 187 
Ban On Higher Education 
INJUCTION: Superior court 
judge says ban conflicts with 
federal laws 
By Jonna Palmer 
News Editor 

The portion of Proposition 187 which 
seeks to bar illegal immigrants from higher 
education was blocked by a preliminary in-
junction last week, making all but two 0; tl~ \: 
proposition's sections unenforceable. Sup.;-
rior Court Judge Stuart Pollak, who passed 
the injunction, said that the ban may violate 
a law that guarantees an equal right to make 

and enforce contracts. He said that the law 
has since been interpreted to protect undocu-
mented immigrants. 

"It's an injunction pending a trial," said 
Gov. Pete Wilson spokeswoman Kristene 
Berman. "Prop. 187 [the higher education 
measure of it] won ' t be implemented until 
the end of the triaL" 

"[The trial] will probably take place some-
time in June," she added. 

The proposition, which was passed with 
~)9 percent of the vote in last November's 
election, would make illegal im migrants in-

Rise AII-Cal 
Faces Liability 
Review 
CONTROVERSEY: 
Administration will determine 
club's fate on Monday 
By Ivan Delventhal 
Senior Staff Writer 

A storm of controversy generated by a recent 
Guardian features article is threatening to wipe out the 
Radically Inclined Ski Club (RISC) All-Cal ski trip. 
The decision as to whether RISC will be banned from 
campus is expected to be announced Monday. 

After reading the Feb. 6 All-Cal article, which 
described episodes of alcohol consumption during the 
trip, administrators expressed concern about the 
university 's liability for club trips. 

According to UCSD Director of Student Legal 
Services Anthony Valladolid, the key issue is RISC's 
affiliation with the university. 

"The liability would hinge on whether the trip is 
university sponsored," said Valladolid. 

"The more direct the involvement of the university, 
the greater their responsibility. The less contact the 
less liability," he added. 

According to former RISC President and current 
a sistant director of the All-Cal Shadi Almasslzadeh, 
RISC receives orne school funds for posters, but the 
trip "has nothing to do with the university." 

"No school money is used on the All-Cal," said 
Almassizadeh. "Tickets pay for the trip." 

Added Almassizadeh, "We've done nothing wrong. 
The question is, what if something does go wrong? 
Who would be accountable?" 

Before going on the All-Cal, participants must sign 
a waiver releasing the regents and RISC from any 
liability. 

The presence of alcoholic beverages at several of 
the events has led school official to que tion whether 
any underage drinking took place during the All -Cal 
trip. 

"If they [RISC] were violating student conduct 
provisions, the university could disband them," 
Valladolid said. 

"When it becomes a matter of morals or ethics, 
however, it is a completely different question," he 
added. 

Diana Emlet a Warren College sophomore who 
participated in this year' All-Cal and who said she 
does not drink alcohol, said the trip offered a vanety of 
activities. 

"Obviously, there was a lot of partying and drink-
ing going on, but if you didn't want to drink you didn ' t 
have to," said Emlet.

A.S. Develops Affordable-Housing Program for Next Year 
FINANCE: Eligible 
students will pay only 
$170 a month 
By Nina Boughton 
Staff Writer 

Approximately 80 eligible stu-
dents could pay as little as $170 per 
month for campus housing next year. 
The Associated Students, Student 
Financial Services (SFS) and Hous-
ing and Dining Services have set 
aside close to 20 apartments for eli-
gible students at Mesa Housing, on 
Regents Road, for the next academic 

year. 
Associate DirectorofSFS Maura 

Richman said that to be eligible for 
low-cost housing, students must be 
juniors or seniors during the 1995-
96 academic year and must qualify 
for financial aid. Students who are 
eligible for UCSD grants or work-
study are ineligible for the program, 
because such financial aid already 
includes rent. 

A.S. President Carla Tesak, who 
has worked for the last year and a 
half to establish low-cost student 
housing at UCSD, said she was ex-
cited about the new plan. 

"[Mesa] has the largest apart-
ments on campus. I think the stu-
dents should take advantage of this. 
[They're] not going to find cheaper 
housing anywhere," said Tesak. 

Tesak said that previous plans 
for 19w-cost housing were not fea-
sible because they would have re-
quired subsidies. 

"[This offers] no extra coslto the 
students, no fine burden to other 
departments," Tesak added. 

Housing and Dining Services 
Administration Director Larry 
Barrett said his department was en-
thusia tic about the new program. 

"We feel very good about it. [It 's] 
something wealways wanted to do," 
Barrett said. 

According to Barrett, the hou -
ing program will operate on a one-
year trial basis. If problems arise 
such as a lack of student interest, or 
if the apartments are needed more 
by another group of people, the pro-
gram could end after one year. 

Barrett said the apartments will 
be leased on a 12-month Septem· 
ber-to-September contract and that 
studentswill be responsible for rent 
electricity and furnishings. He added

Beth Ford's college education 
may be put to the test on March 8

to pit her knowledge against other 
college students from around the 
country on the "Jeopardy" College

Ford, a graduating

a contestant on the 
gameshow if one of 
the other 15 contes-

The four people who passed the 
written testthen played a mock game 
in which they stood on stage and 
used the real " Jeopardy" buzzers.

Empire in Decline: An Open 
LeHer to the Regents 

As you arrive on campus, you will probably be taken aback by your 
ingratiating reception: UCSD students, some of whom are campus lead-
ers and most of whom political moderates, chanting slogans, wielding 
signs and, of course, bearing loads ofT-shirts in an attempt to dissuade 
you from enacting further tuition increases. The event, which was pre-
ceded by an all-night vigil and rock concert, is the culmination of a 
systemwide campaign to draw attention to the obvious: The University 
of California is on a crash course with disaster. 

In the last several years, we have sadly witnessed the UC Master 
Plan for Higher Education, celebrated world-wide as a paragon for pub-
lic higher education, battered beyond recognition. UC student fees have 
increased over 124 percent since since the beginning of the decade 
(over 90 percent in real dollars), while California 's median household 
income has actually declined. Although student financial aid has in-
creased during Ihis period, the availablity of aid has not kept apace 
with tuition increases. In addition, the fastest growing form of finan-
cial aid is loans, not grants. 

While student tuition hikes have garnered the most attention, UC 
staff and faculty have suffered as well. Despite a series of upper-level 
administrative salary hikes, reaching the height of absurdity with former 
UC President David P. Garner 's $800,000-plus severance package, 
much of the University of California 's staff and faculty has endured 
wage and salary freezes. UC faculty members, the core of the univer-
sity, now earn an estimated 10 percent below the national average. Taken 
with your aggressive early retirement campaign, such freezes have only 
served to erode the UC's well-earned reputation as one of the nation's 
- indeed tile world 's - premiere institutions of higher learning and 
research. As the framers of the Master Plan knew in 1960, without 
competitive salaries, the University of California would faulter. 

As the university 'S highest-ranking officials, these issues should weigh 
heavily upon your shoulders. Which is why we make an appeal to you 
today to use your considerable influence to rollback the damage done to 
our university. 

By most indicators, California's fiscal earthquake is over and we are 
heading confidently into economic recovery. However, unlike the past, 
when support for higher education fluctuated with the "natural" boom 
and bust cycles, our governor and Legislature clearly have no intention 
of restoring the university'S budget. The Master Plan for Higher Educa-
tion, once cherished as California 's crown jewel, has ironically lost pri-
ority to state criminal justice and corrections spending. 

Ludicriuously billed as "pro-education," Gov. Wilson's state bud-
get proposal would increase UC state funding a paltry two percent per 
year for the next four years. Considering the UC budget was slashed 
by 24 percent, or $548,051,000 in constant dollars, between 1990 and 
1994, Wilson's two percent would do nothing to regain lost ground. As 
the usual "last rcsort," students are expected to take up the slack: The 
governor's UC budget plan would throw another four years of to-per-
cent tuition increases down the turnpike. By 1998-99, students would 
be paying a $5,500 cover charge for a UC education. The message of 
Gov. Wilson's budget is clear: The California Master Plan for Educa-
tion is a relic which should be left to die. 

Despite mounting dissent at the Capitol- 24 Democratic senators, 
joined by one Independent, recently blasted the Wilson budget'S short 
changing of higher education - we have heard nary a peep of opposi-
tion, much less outcry, from you. Incredibly, when Gov. Wilson un-
veiled his budget proposal last month, outgoing UC President Jack 
Peltason said, "The governor 's compact represents a strong commit-
ment to renewing the state's investment in higher education." For 
Peltason's words to be any more conciliatory, he would have had to 
say them on his knees, kissing Gov. Wilson 's feet. Taken with your 
own silence, Peltason's words signal, in such a stark and grotesque 
form, a crisis of leadership at the Uc. 

These are strong words no doubt, but we write them not in malice 
and not, in our opinion, in a rush to judgment. As you all know well, 
the University of California is facing a crisis of epic proportions. 
California's universities are not only battling head-to-head with state 
corrections for funding, but are faci ng a historical boom in the student-
age population. Dubbed "Tidal Wave II," an increase of 450,000 stu-
dents are projected to hit California's shores by 2006. The California 
Higher Education Policy Center, The Rand Corporation and other think 
tanks have released amazingly dismal forecasts of the future of higher 
education in California. 

However, not only have you been unwilling to lead a fight for higher 
education, but you have yet to establish a clear, long-term strategy for 
dealing with the enormous problems facing the UC. Though it may be 
unreal istic to expect all tenets of the Master Plan for Higher Education to 
be preserved, allowing the plan to be scrapped, wholesale, without a fight, 
would be nothing less than a tragedy. As Californians, we have tended to 
take our educational resources for granted, assuming that they will al-
ways be available for us or our children. But complacency wilt only as-
sure that tomorrow, one of our most prized assets, one of our most noble 
promises, will wither away and slip from the hands of the future.

years . One day, 
however, this writer 
had the urge to con -

sweeter than his

thought, spying ajar of Jolly Rancher hard 
candies, just what I need! He stepped up 
to the counter, pulled out five of the little 
suckers, greeted the cashier with a smile 
and motioned to the little pile. 

"Fifty cents, please." 
Fifty cents! That's to cents apiece! 

How could this be? You can get them for 
five cents each at 7-11 . Who was the per-
petrator of this wickedness? Who? 

The cashier shrugged and said, "Ask the 
regents." 

The regents, of course! The writer 
smiled malevolently and burst from the 
store, his tiny black heart beating with ex-
citement. He reached his house, turned on 
his computer and laughed diabolically. He 
wrote:

which each may be opened only once 
during the quarter. Whatever the case, 
students end up paying the price. For-
tunately, UCSD's student co-ops, the 
existence of which is rare on college 
campuses, have given us an alternative 
to buying from the UCSD Bookstore. 
This is especially true of the General 
Store Co-op, which offers some of the 
same books as the campus bookstore 
at a lower price. According to a recent 
California Public Interest Research 
Group (CALPIRG) survey, a Chemis-
try 6 textbook costs $64.31 at the Gen-
eral Co-op, compared to $71.35 at the 
bookstore. Revelle Bargain Books is 
also an excellent source for used texts 
- it's probably the only place where I 
feel good about writing a check out to 
the regents. I 've picked up books there 
for three bucks - books which went 
for nearly eight at the Bookstore. 

All of this is fine and dandy. Nev-
ertheless, most of our texts come from 
the campus bookstore, despite the ef-
forts of the co-ops and used-book-
stores. This alone should indicate that 
the regents are not looking out for stu-
dents. Texts, however, are only part of 
the problem. Buying any groceries on

wouldn't find at any store that 
wanted to succeed in the free mar-
ket. Most UCSD students know this. 
However, just for your information, 
I did some comparative shopping: 

• At Earl's Place, a 1.5-liter bottle 
of Crystal Geyser water costs $1 .85. 
At Ralph 's, Crystal Geyser goes for 
75 cents. That's a 146-percent mark-
up. 

• Campbell's cream of chicken 
soup costs $1.59 at Earl's Place. II 
costs 99 cents at Ralph's, or 62 per-
cent less than at Earl '5. 

• Oscar Meyer bologna costs 
$2.39 a1 Earl's and $1.39 at Ralph 's. 

If you must shop on campus, 
UCSD Bookstore satellites (i.e. the 
Sunshine and Sundry stores) seem 
to have better prices than .the Din-
ing Services' stores. Water which 
sells for $1.85 at Earl's costs $1.40 
at the Sunshine Store. A package of 
12 Trojan lubricated condoms goes 
for $6.89 at Earl's and $6.05 at Sun-
shine. (Even better, 12 Sheik 
condoms sell for less than four 
bucks at Student Health Services.) 

By the way, Jolly Ranchers only 
cost five cents at the Sunshine Store. 

Going to Ralph's, however, defi-
nitely has its advantages. II 's true 
that some product prices are com-
parable (milk. for example. is about 
the same price on or off campus), 
but rarely will you find products at 
a grocery store which cost less on 
campus. Condoms and shoelaces 
were the only items I found which 
cost more at Ralph 's. But we are 
talking about Ralph 's in the middle 
of La Jolla, "The Jewel" of Califor-
nia. Ralph 's certainly doesn't have 
the reputation of being the cheapest 
grocery store. It's probably worth 
the to-minute ride to Vons to save 
money on the same groceries you 
can get at Ralph's. 

Butl ike many college students on 
the verge of bankruptcy, perhaps you 
don ' t own a car. Most of us wouldn't 
take the bus to get to Ralph ·s. Many 
of us wilh cars can't afford the time 
away from our studies to get a fairer 
price at a c1ose-but-not-c1ose-enough 
location . Who can , when the 
university's annual financial report 
states that the average student spends 
64 hours per week studying and at-
tending classes? 

And therein lies the strength of 
the regents' position at UCSD.It 's

difficult for students to shQp off 
campus. Our regents, in effect, op-
erate a monopoly. The only compe-
tition they have, if one can call it 
competition, are the student co-ops. 
And if the administration eventually 
gets what it wants and the co-ops 
disappear, then what? Will it in-
crease the price of its bread and 
water even more? 

It is criminal that we are paying 
such extravagant prices for our 
schooling, while the caretakers of 
our educations are busy giving 
themselves raises. According to the 
university 's annual financial report, 
UCSD raked in over $1 billion in 
revenues in 1994 - nearly 20 per-
cent of this came from sundry sales 
and services, whereas student tu-
ition made up only eight percent. 
Smells like exploitation to me. 

The regents are meeting this 
Thursday at the Price Center Ball-
room, starling at 9:30 a.m. In re-
sponse, the A.S. has organized an 
all-night concert reception to pro-
test the proposal to raise student 
fees . When you go, remember that

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thursday, February 16, 1995 

CORPORATE BALLOONS OVERTAKE PRICE CEN'rER 
Editor: 

My mind drifting off, I am tak-
ing in the blazing sun and laying on 
the grassy slope when I am quickly 
brought back to reality with the 
screeching sound of ringing cash 
registers. I am abruptly reminded 
that I am in the middle of the Price 
Center and the towcring glory of 50-
foot balloons in the shape of Clcarly 
Canadian- and Lipton- Original Ice 
Tea bollies - how divine. Indced, 
it is the grand Jeep-Eagle- Health 
and Fitness Tour. 

Last week, students' health was 
a prime concern of major auto 
companies, as these benevolent 
corporations brought our campus 
a variety of challengcs (bungce 
run, Velcro wall, wall climb), so 
that we students might shape our 
bodies to a state of oiled, glisten-
ing perfection, while K-WEIRD 
busts out the tunes for our listen-
ing pleasure. 

When I entered this university 
about four years ago, I expected to 
receive a good education at a good 
price ($980 per quarter); now, I re-
ceive a really good education at an 
even better price ($1 ,450 per quar-
ter). 

Howevcr, I was also eager to 
take in the complete "college ex-

perience." Little did I know this 
experience would include a~rpo­
rate swap meet filling up our 
prized student center, where pre-
viously, the only thing I had been 
forced to stomach was cheap fast 
food. 

Is this some kind of omen for us 
college students? Is this something 
wc should real ly be concerned 
about? As we walk toward Univer-
sity Library, shou ld we carefully 
consider that our future might be a 
little beller if we were to peddle hair 
products and Reebok- athletic 
shoes? 

Fortunately, we only have to 
welcome the latest "College Tour" 
about once per quarter. I should be 
happy that I only have to ignore 
some jewelry table, college club or 
a credit card offer once in a while, 
as I walk through the Price Club 
- er, Center. 

The question we students should 
ask the administration is, "Who gets 
paid?" I would like to know, be-
cause I would sure like a piece of 
the action - just a little university 
lesson on capitalism. I know that 
there has to be more on the line than 
just our "Health and Fitness." 

In the end, my biggest concern 
really lies in a future where ~e'll

Pub Feature Promot_ 
Divisiveness 
Editor: , 

Judging by the tone of his article 
(" A Tale of 2 Pubs," Peb. 13), Harry 
Tasker's disdain for graduate stu-
dents seems eclipsed only by his 
glorification of drunkenness, his 
contempt for women and his ~ove 
for himself. 

I wish to remind his readers that 
the renovation of the pub facility, 
without which Porter 's would 
never have cracked the Bull's Eye 
monopoly, was heavily financed 
by the Graduate Student Associa-
tion. 

Irresponsible rhetoric such as 
Tasker's contributes to the spirit of 
divisiveness which exists on this 
campus, and prevents effective and 
unified student action.

Heavy Raina Increase 
Ocean Pollution 
Editor: 

The recent rains have impacted 
much of Southern California. The 
focus has tended to be on the floods 
and landslides in the area, and with 
good reason - these events were 

tragic and devastating. However, 
these rainy periods also pollute our 
coastal waters. Coastal pollution 
impacts the health and well -being 
of oUI community, especially affect-
ing people who are in close contact 
with the pollution. The heaviest 
impact is on swimmers, surfers and 
those of us who like seafood. 

Heavy rains enter the picture be-
cause they scour the streets, wash-
ing away thc residue which has built 
up over time: oil from leaky cars, ex-
haust particles a!ld worn rubber from 
tires. This is great if you like clean 
streets, but it sucks for ocean-goors. 
The dirty water flows into local 
storm drains and then to the ocean 
via pipes, which can be seen at many 
beaches. Storm drains arc not con-
nected to sewage treatment plants. 

I know that we are all busy in 
this fast-paced world, but ask your-
self this: "How long will it take to 
have my oil leak checked or to drop 
off my used motor oil and paint at 
the next hazardous waste collection 
event?" The bottom line is that these 
steps will help to solve the problem 
of polluted ocean water. 

Also, thanks to Marianne Vigil for 
her wcll-written story about contami-
nated water ("Wiped Out," Oct, 24).

UCSD CLUB SPORTS 
ROUND-UP 

Cycling 

In cycling - as in most sports 
- it's important to peak at the right 
time. With its schedule still in in-

• 

fancy, the UCSD cy-
cling team is right on 
pace to hit Nationals in 
fu II stride. 

Take last weekend's 
meet, for example. Racing through 
the rough Long Beach Tourney, the 
Triton cyclists took second place on 
both days, slipping only to UCLA 
and UC Santa Barbara. 

"We're doing fine right now, 
considering our speed training 
hasn't even started yet," UCSD 
Head Coach Glenn Sanders said. 

Saturday's race featured the 
Parking Lot Criterium, a short 0.9 
mile loop with several turns. 

The highlight 
of the weekend 
for UCSD, how. 
ever, had to be 
Ian Bettinger, 
who - thanks 
to a solo 
breakaway for 
the last five 
miles - dashed 
to first place in 
the Men's "A" 
Division. 

On Sunday, 
Long Beach 
played host to

fourth place in the Women's" A" Di-
vision. She was followed c10sel y by 
teammate Karina Francis' seventh-
place effort. third in Adam Uvlngston took second In Sunday's race_ 

In the Women's "B" Division, 
UCSD's Bettina Wood captured 
third place overall, while Kate Esley 
drafted herself into fourth, 

The Triton men did equally well, 
as both .Dan Sawada and Jeff 
Hernandez garnered the bronze in 
the Men 's "C" and "D" Divisions, 
respectively.

while Bettina Wood flew across in

The UCSD puckste,. will face rival San Dleeo State on Saturday. 

The Triton hockey team has a 
date with destiny this Saturday, It's 
an opponent on their schedule that 

always be-
comes larger 
than I ife. It's a 
contest 
against cross-
town rival 
San Diego 

State, and it's going to be violent. 
"We haven' t beaten them in over 

two years," team captain Steve 
Schwartz said . " We ' re out for 
blood," 

The Tritons will be without star 
player Brian Dunbar, UCSD has 
been playing with increasing team 
consistency of late, however, scor· 
ing multiple goals in recent games, 
The Mark Novom -Scott Porter 
combination at goal has also proved 
effective, and the Tritons have a · 
solid shot of upstaging the Divsion 
I Aztecs at home. 

With a 2·8 record going into the 
game, the UCSD skaters are hop-
ing to make alate-season run for the 

playoffs, 
In previous years, the top two 

teams of the Western Conference 
and two wild card teams were se-
lected for post-season play. This 
year, the divisions have been ex-
panded, and UCSD could land in a 
bigger playoff bracket with Pacific, 
Cal Tech, and Fresno State - all 
weaker divisional teams. 

"In the playoffs, anything can 
happen," Schwartz said. 

Saturday'S game versus SDSU at 
the Sports Arena will begin at 10 
p.m" following the Gulls game. The 
Triton pucksters will hold a 
fundraiser today and tomorrow in 
the Price Center from 11 a.m.-3 p.m. 
to sell tickets for the game. 

"We're starting to come together 
as a team," Schwartz said. "The 
game [against SDSU] will be a real 
exciting, physical game." 
. UCSD will embark on a four-
game road trip following the Aztec 
contest, with games against UN 
Reno, UCD, Pacific and UCLA,

Ultimate Disc 

It was a tangle with the big 
boys, and when it was all over 
the UCSD ultimate disc team 

gained 
m 0 r e 
than just 
respect. 

The 
Triton discers rolled through the 
competition at the Tempe Ari-
zona Ultimate Tourney on Feb-
ruary 4-5, sweeping their first 
three contests before slipping in 
their final three. 

"It was a great showing for 
[our team]," team co-captain 
Chris Weaver said. "We will be 
very strong against other college 
teams this spring." 

In its first game, UCSD 
slipped by Bay Area, 6-4, Game 
two brought on more of the 
same, as the Tritons thoroughly 
pummeled Phoenix, 11-2. 

Keeping the win-streak aliver 
UCSD won again in game three 
- this time, it was a 11-8 dis-
mantling of Tuscon. 

"Our defense was eXlremely 
stingy, forcing a lot of turnovers" 
Weaver said. "We were faster as 
a team than any other team." 

This Triton team speed 
couldn't save them in their fourth 
game, UCSD fell in a close con-
lest, 11-9, to Wisconsin. 

It was all downhill from 
there, as the Tritons lost io Boul-
der by a tight 13-12 margin and 
to Houston by an 11-9 score, 

UCSO's final 3-3 tournament 
record was nothing to scoff at, 
however. Tucson, Wisconsin, 
Boulder and Houston are tough 
teams that crush most squads, 

Next on the schedule, the Tri· 
ton discers' will play the role of 
hosts for a 12·team weekend 
tourney held al Pryatel, Warren 
and Muir fields.

Women's LaCrosse 

When you're accustomed to 
large margins of victory like the 
UCSD women 's lacrosse team, it 's 
difficult to get used to having to 

work hard for day-to-

., 

daYH:i::ver, with a 
• . new coach at the helm 

and a young squad on 
the field, the Tritons 

will find themselves in some tight 
battles this season - contests which 
they have not had to endure with the 
prolific UCSD teams of recent 
years. 

Luckily, UCSD still has enough 
experience and talent on the team 
to lead the way to victory, and on 
Saturday afternoon, the way to a 
certain win was blocked by the Bru-
ins of UCLA. 

The fast-moving Bruin attack 

UCSD's "0" was In full swing.

Slips by the Tritons 
Continued from page 12 
the deflated Tritons by mauling 
them in runaway fashion in game 
two, 15-4. 

With the arrival of a new game 
- game three - came a new Tri-
ton resurgence. UCSD team leaders 
Tyson Kerr and Tom Black showed 
veteran form, leading an all-out at-
tack to place UCSD back into the 
match. 

The Tritons won two in-a-row to 
even the match at two games apiece, 
setting up the deciding game five, 
which would be played under rally 
scoring. 

UCSD has not faired well in rally 
scoring thus far this season, and 
Tuesday night was no different. San 
Diego State took advantage of the 
fifth-game scoring and went on to 
seal up the match with a 15-8, final 
game victory. 

The Aztecs were powered by 
John Hyden 's game-high 39 kills, 
and Geno Urcan 's game-high ] 2

posed a bit of a problem for the 
young Tritons, who were surprised 
by UCLA's speed. The Tritons of-
ten find themselves running circles 
around their stone-footed oppo-
nents. 

However, the UCSD high-scor-
ing offense was not slowed by 
UCLA's speed, and the Tritons man-
aged to escape with a hard-fought 
13-12 victory. 

"I was fairly impressed," senior 
Lac Nguyen said. "We are a young 
team, but we really held our own." 

The score may well have been

ing shot by the experienced veteran

the officials who ruled it no goal.

UCSD players put in strong 

individual performances against 
State, led by team captain Tyson 
Kerr 's 32 kills and nine digs as 
well as Tom Black's 22 kills . 
Both continued to shine brightly 
through the team 's tough season. 

Ed McMahon, who has come 
on very strong of late, added 17 
kills for UCSD. His teammate, 
Dan Thomassen, jumped at the 
opportunity of gaining extra 
playing time by slamming down 
15 kills and coming Up with eight 
big-time digs. 

The Tritons now find them-
selves in the midst of an eight-
game losing skid, while they pre-
pare for the best reward of com-
peting in the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation - a visit to 
the beautiful Hawaiian Islands 
for a two-game showdown with 
the University of Hawaii 'Rain-
bows. 

Leaving RIMAC and going 
across town was not enough to 
turn things around for UCSD on 
Tuesday, but perhaps a weekend 
jaunt to Honolulu will be just 
what the doctor ordered, 

However, the triumphant Tritons 
were not about to bicker over mar-
gins of victory. 

On Sunday afiernoon, UCSD put 
on a display typical of their domi-
nating triumphs in years past. 

USC came call i ng on the Tritons 
at Pry tel Field and were quickly 
taught a lesson in the finer points of 
the game of lacrosse, 

UCSD pummeled outgunned

match for the Tritons who raised 
their record to 2-0 and completed a 
two-day sweep of the Los Angeles 
contingent. 

"It was a really easy game," 
Nguyen said. "It really wasn't much 
fun to play because there was so 
little competition. n

WHINERS: 
Give'em Kathy Lee 
Continued from page 12 
writing articles, but I don't see six-
figure checks. 

The owners, who make millions 
every day by just breathing, say, 
"We 're losing money. We need a 
salary cap. n But the next day, they 
sign a lifetime ,260 hitter to a three-
year deal worth 10 million gigillion 
dollars. 

So whom do I root for? Neither! 
I can go and watch college ball or 
high-school ball. At least those guys 
are giving it their best. And they 
don ' t whine and moan. 

Luckily,l do have a solution for 
the big guys: We should get all play-
ers and owners and put 'em in a 
room. Then, we 'd make them watch 
Kathy Lee sing the national anthem 
over and over again until there's a 
settlement. It should probably take 
until " ... and the bombs bursting in 
air." 

And who knows, maybe they can 
get it worked out after all. But for 
now I have three words for all of 
them: I DON'T CARE!

Don't Pick the

Somebody asked me the 
other day if I would pay to 
watch the scabs - Major 
League Baseball replacement 
players - play. The an wer 
was easy: No way. 

UCSD Crushes Claremont 
This isn't because I'm a fair 

weather baseball fan, or 
because I'd only pay to watch 
the real player out on the 
field. I don't want to put more 
money in the owners' hands. 
And it's not becau e I was 
forced to see that damned 18-
hour documentary by Ken 
Burns. 

The reason is simple: I'm 
fed up ! Fed up with the 
owners. Tired of players. I 
cringe anytime I see Donald 
Fehr, Bob Ussery, or Dick 
Ravitch . 

I used to peruse multiple 
media outlets, searching for 
any sports information. Now, 
every day I purposely shy 
away from my menu of radio 
sports-talk. In fact, I tune in to 
ESPN at 4:05 every afternoon, 
just so I can miss the exciting 
news of "late-breaking 
developments" in the strike. 

I'm just sick and tired of 
overpaid players and snobby

that isn't even theirs. Even if

CRUISING: The Triton divers 
dominated the competition at 
the Claremont Invitational 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Last weekend's Claremont Invitational repre-
sented little more than an over-formalized prac-
tice session for the UCSD diving team. The Tri-

tons traveled to Claremont and 
made short work of such avail-
able Division III competition as 
Occidenta I, Cal Tech and 
Pomona Pitzer. 

For thc women , Sheri 
Takeuchi contributed with her 
usual : two outstanding sets of 
dives en route,to first place fin-
ishes in both the one- and three-
meter springboards. However, 
she was not alone at the top. 
UCSD's Brigitte Elfman and 

Kristi Young were in close support. Elfman snared 
second-place in the one-meter board and came 
through with another strong showing in the three-
meter to earn third. Young also rose to the occa-
sion on the three-meter, grabbing second-place 
honors. 

The men were equally dominant as the Tri-
tons' small contingent swept first and second 
place in both disciplines. Adam Burgasser earned 
first place on both boards while teammate Josh 
Curtiss, who is battling back injuries, came 
through with a pair of second-place finishes. 

I don 't understand. They're 
both losing money, aren ' t 
they? In the spirit of capital-
ism, shouldn't they be able to 
work it out? Guess not. 

The Triton men's diving squad soared over the competition at last meet. 

"There are only a few schools in California 
that are Division III ," Takeuchi said. "but they 
don 't get the kind of coaching we do. Our coaches 
arc really outstanding." 

I mean, things have gotten 
so bad that Bill Clinton is 
making appearances on 
Sportscenter. And really, 
doesn't he have something 
better to do? Last time I 
checked, he was supposed to 
be governing the nation, not 
carrying the diapers of players 
and owners. His popularity 
rating can 't be that bad. 

Aztecs Aggravate the llitons in Five 

Please don't get me wrong. 
I don't hate the game. I'm just 
like every other sports fan . I 
love the smell of fresh-cut, 
green grass and hearing the 
crack of a bat. I'll even pay the 
$10 bucks for parking, $5 for a 
dog, and $3 for a coke just to 
go down to the 'Murph and 
watch Tony get a couple of 
hits. 

But for now, I'm on strike. 
With the likes of "D.A."-ryll 
Strawberry and Steve Howe, I 
can't help but scorn the 
playe[s. They get paid millions 
to do a job they love. I like

NULL SET: UCSD (0-8) still looking for that 
elusive first win; will travel to Hawaii next 

By Jeremy Malamed 
Staff Writer 

After opening up the season with 
seven straight losses at home, the 
UCSD men's volleyball team de-

cided to take its 
show on the road. 

The Triton 
spikers traveled 
across Miss ion 
Valley to the un -
friendly confines 
of San Diego 
State for a league 
match with the 
Aztecs on Tues-
day night. 

Looking to come away with their 
first victory ofthe year, the Tritons' 
effort fell short once again, as they 
were out-dueled in a five set con-
test by their neighboring bosts, 16-

14,15-4, \0-15, 12-15, 15-8. 
The Tritons (0-8, 0-6) came out 

of the locker room with a full hcad 
of steam, ready to dominate the Az-
tecs (3-3, 3-3). Riding its early mo-
mentum, UCSD raced out to a 14-8 
lead in game one, slamming down 
just about everything that came in 
sight. 

But with the comfort of an early 
lead under its belt, UCSD soon be-
came complacent and watched its 
big lead slowly dwindle away -
until they found themselves locked 
in a tight battle with the scrappy 
Aztec squad. 

As the momentum shifted to 
SDSU's corner, the Aztecs seized 
control of the match and completed 
the comeback, stealing game one, 
16-14. They continued to cruise by

Lou Barlow turns down major record labels to do things his way 

W hen Sebadoh bassist-vocalist Lou Barlow was kicked out of Dinosaur, Jr. in 1989, he was 
understandabl y disappointed. At the time, 
Dinosaur, Jr. was one of the most influ-
ential bands on the independent music 
scene. Dinosaur, Jr. guitarist 1. Mascis, 
who has been compared to Neil Young, 
was being heralded as a genius, and the 
band's popularity was steadily rising. In 
a recent phone interview from his home 
in Boston, MA, Barlow, . whose band, 
Sebadoh, will perform Sunday at the 
World Beat Center, spoke about his split 

By JEFF 

from Dinosaur, Jr. 
"I was just slowly being pushed out of 

a pretty miserable picture. When the 
band first started 1. [Mascis 1 was incred-
ibly creative and making complex songs 
that had ideas in them. As the band got 
popular, he just got really lazy," Barlow 
said. "He was such a fucking asshole, but 
he was funny as hell . He was the cruelest, 
funniest person. He just wanted to tell 
people how little he cared about them. 
My whole deal is that I care about every-
thing. It's really fucking great that I got 
booted, but 1 was bummed at the time. 

I'm really happy, especially since our 
records blow his away now." 

It's almost impossible to keep track of 
all the projects in which Barlow is in-
volved. With guitaristJason Loewenstein 
anddrurnmersBobFayandEricGaffney, 
he has released a number of "home re-
cordings" on independent labels such as 
Shrimper, Homestead, Sub Pop and 
Smells Like Records. 

"I kind of forget what I'm working on. 
I say, ' No, I 'm not recording anything.' 
And then I remember thatl just fmished 
a project a few weeks ago," Barlow said.

Boys on 
the Side 

Road film leaves 
characters 

undeveloped 
By Chla-Un Simmons 
Staff Writer 

With spring break approaching, 
Hollywood has given audiences the 
road-trip movie, Boys Oil the Side, 
director Herbert Ross's film about 
the search to find one's self while 
traveling across the country. Boys 
Oil the Side, however, ends up being 
just a stale version of Thelma alld 
Louise. 

Boys on the Side is the 
story oflhree women who 
drive from New York to 
California in a quest for a 
new life. Struck with 
AIDS. from her relation-
ship with a bartender, 
Robin (Mary-Louise 
Parker) hopes to hide from 
her disease by driving 
cross-country with two 
strangers who answer her 
ride-share want ad.

lesbian musician who answers (he ad

hoping to get to L.A. to improve her 
career. Holly (Drew Barrymore), (he 
third member of the trio, tries to es-
cape from her abusive boyfriend but 

ends up in more trouble 
than she anticipates. 

Though Boys on the 
Side has the potential to be 
a touching movie, it fails to 
produce results. Perhaps 
part of the problem is that 
Jane and Holly are under-
developed characters with 
no history, background or 
motivation. 

Another problem with 
the film is its desire to cover too many 
issues in two hours. The attempt to 
discuss issues such as AIDS, homo-

year playing the same 20 songs so you 
can be the biggest pop star in the 
world.' Fuck it. I'm not going to do 
that." 

With the success of its recent al-
bum Balresale, Sebadoh is clearly 
perched at the top of a burgeoning 
indie rock scene and has been bom-
barded with offers from major record 
labels. Critics have hailed the band, 
known for its sparse, four-track re-
cordings made in Barlow's living 
room, for spearheading the lo-fi mu-
sic scene, which includes singer Liz 
Phair and bands such as Pavement 
and Guided by Voices. Barlow said 
Sebadoh has been unfairly pigeon-
holed as lo-fi and when he is ap-
proached by major record labels, he 
tells them to call back. 

"I ask them [major record label 
representatives j, 'Can you call back 
in a couple months?' I don't have any 
problems with signing to a major la-
bel,butl don 't know why. It's like,do 
I want to progress at a slow pace or 
have my face on every magazine 
cover? Then there would be MTV 

sexuality and communication between 
women results in unfinished state-
ments. 

However, Boys on the Side has its 
highlights. Parker does an excellent 
job portraying Robin 's insecurity, fear 
and hopelessness. She is theonlychar-
acter fully developed in the movie. 
Last seen in Fried Green Tomalos 
playing a similar character, Parker 
once again shows her talent as an 
actress. 

Boys on the Side has an amazing 
soundtrack perfect for a cross-coun-
try roadtrip. Featuringsongsby Bonnie

payoffs. If you are with a major label, 
they can make a sensation out of any-
thing and a lot of them don't add up to 
anything. I don't know how eager I 
am to have our next record literally 
forced down people's throats." 

One change which has attracted 
new listeners is the fact that almost 
every song on Balresale is accessible. 
In the past, Sebadoh albums have 
included a mixed bag of songs, some 
with catchy harmonies and others 
sounding dissonant and raw. 

"I think the only thing that scared 
people were [drummer) Eric 
Gaffney 'S songs. People thought, 
'Wait a minute, this isn't like every-
thing else I've ever heard in my life. 
This sucks.' Because you get one of 
my songs next toone of his, people are 
so used to having everything reduced 
to this pabulum, from indierockerson

"I personally loved Eric's songs, 

but my tastes obviously don't reflect 
what most people think. I saw Tom 
Petty on MTV saying it was rare to 
meet someone like Rick Rubin who 
could listen to Tom Petty and Slayer. 
But that's me. I can listen to any-

Another distinctive quality about 
Barlow's songs is the fact that he 
writes from multiple points of view. 

"I would never say that I write 
from a feminine perspective, but my 
songs are all about empathy, " Barlow 
said. 

"I'm just trying to put myself in 
other people's positions, whether it's 
that of a woman or a friend of mine. I 
came from a really stable family and 
they instilled me with a sense of love

Howard 
Stern hits 
airwaves' 

Disc jocker is 
obrwxious but 

hardly 
shocking 

By Jeff Nlelel 
Hiatus Editor 

In radio disc jockey Howard 
Stern's autobiography, Private 
ParlS,cultural crit ic Camille Paglia 
is quoted as saying: "He's com-
pletely anarchic, outside the es-
tablishment. He's bawdy, lewd, 
lustful... constantly attacking sa-
credcows." But Paglia, whose anti-
feminist interpretationsofpopular 
culture are often misguided, has 
said sim i larthings about Madonna, 
and it 's questionable to what de-
gree Madonna challenges cultural 
norms. Stem, known for making 
fun of lesbians and exhibiting xe-
nophobia, comes off as being 
risque, but he's really not that radi-
cal.lnfact. hispoliticsoftensound 
like the ultra-conservative rheto-
ric of Rush Limbaugh, that other 
loud-mouthed morning talk show 
sensation. 

Stem made his San Diego ra-
dio debut Monday morning with 
an appropriate bang. He began his 
program on 91X (which airs live 
from New York from 3-6 a.m. and 
thenon tape delay from 6-1 I a.m.) 
by making fun of general manager 
Mike G I ickenhaus' announcement 
thaI Stem was going to be the 
station's new morning show. He 
called Glickenhaus "Dickenstein" 
and said he was "effeminate." 
During a press conference with 
San Diego area journalists, which 
I apprehensively attended, Stem 
was his usual raunchy self. Before 
segueing into the press confer-
ence, he said he advocated the 
sterilization of retarded women 
and challenged anyone to dispute 
him. 

"Can you see the articles to-
morrow?" Stem asked. "Don't

Before 
Sunrise 
Director and 
stars discuss 

focus on 
everyday life 

By Jeff Nlesel 
Hiatus Editor 

Director Richard Linklater's films 
are known as fragmented but intelli-
gent examinations of youth culture . 
His previous efforts, Slacker and the 
'70s revivalDazed alld Coo fused, are 
now considered cult classics, yet nei-
ther film featured an actor or actress 
considered to be a big star. Rather, 
each movie was filled with more char-
acters than the viewer could follow. 
With his latest film, Before SWJrise, 
Linklater has ostensibly shifted gears, 
focusing on the experiences of Jesse 
(Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie 
Delpy) as they meet on a train in 
Vienna and spend a single night to-
gether. 

"I think this has happened 
to lots of people in various 
ways. We all meet people 
we have some kind of con-
nection with, and it 's just a 
matter of how far you take 
that," Linklater said during 
a recent press conference 
with Delpy and Hawke at 

. Sony Pictures studios in Culver City, 
CA. 

"I don 't think it 's way different 
than anything I've done. My other 
movies have been about 100 people 
talking non-stop and this is about two 
people talking non-stop," Linklater 
said. "I got the idea about five years 
ago and eventually got in a position to 
do it. I was having a night similar to 
this in Philadelphia." 

In the film, Jesse, an American, is 
on the last leg of his European excur-
sion when he meets Celine. Even 
though hedoesn 't have enough money 
for a hotel room, he asks her to spend 
the evening with him. She is on her

any of you want retarded children? 
No.1 don 'thearanyonesteppingupto

Stem went on to make an opening 
statement that, in typical fashion, was 
nothing more than self-promotion. 

"I want to say that I am the world's 
most perfect entertainer. I am the fun-
niest, I am the wittiest and the homi-
est. There will be more jokes, put-
downs and girls with pierced vaginas 
than you can shake a stick at. I will 
come into your town and make a 
stink. My show is like a bad fart, but 
you will come to love my stench and 
you will come to expect it and desire 
it." 

Stem, who said he has nine months 
left on his contract, declared he would 
become the top-rated morning show 
by the middle of next week. He also 
threatened to destroy any competi-
tion, calling the Shelly and Chainsaw 
morning program on Rock 102, 
"Howard Stem impersonators."

wander the streets of Vienna, talking 
about their personal philosophies and 
past relationships.

worked with famous European direc-
tors such as Jean-Luc Godard, 
Krysztof Kieslowski and Agnieska 

Holland,carriesthefilm. Her 
sincerity contrasts with 
Hawke's cynicism, and 
makes hercharacterthe more 
sympathetic of the two. 

"Working with Richard 
was totally different from 
any director 1 've worked 
with before," Delpy said. 

"Most of the directors in Europe are 
very different. When you work with 
Godard, he gives you two lines three 
minutes before you come on the set. 
He tells you, 'You a~e going to sit, 
you ' regoing to look at this guy, you 're 
going to grab the clarinet and playa 
little, move to the other side and then 
we' ll see.' It 's great but it 's lotally 
different. Kieslowski is obsessed with 
power. 1 don ' t compare directors be-
cause 1 thir:tk it's like comparing 
people. 1 don ' I know anyone who is 
the same." 

For Hawke, the film represents a 
chance to shake off some of the ste-
reotypes that have been used .to de-

said. "Tell Jeff and Jer [the current 
No.1 morning show] to grease up." 

Stem didn't seem to think that

would hurt his ratings. 

"I like new music and 1 think we 
are cutting edge," he said. "I listened 
to Bush [the English rock act] this 
weekend. I like Bush more than any 
other man on the planet. My wife just 
won't let me get any." 

Although Stem's I isteners (at least 
the ones who show up for his notori-
ously packed book signings) tend to 
be middle-aged males, usually sport-
ing pot-bellies and mustaches, Stem 
says he connects with college audi-
ences. 

"College students are probably the 
first ones who come on board. They 
seem to be the most open-minded and 
the ones who are looking for change. 
You find that as time goes on, the 24-
35-year-olds come on. It's a pattern 
that runs throughout the country," he 
said in response to my question. "We 
have a very sizable female audience, 
but our male audience is so big, it is 
written about more. If most morning 
shows had as many women listening 
as we do, they would be 'thrilled. Face 
it, guys like my show more than 
women, because it is pretty good boner 

scribe his acting. 
"People talk a lot about stereo-

types and it's ridiculous. After I did 
Dead Poets Society, everyone thought 
I was a shy, introverted kid," Hawke 
said. "And then I did Reality Bites and 
people thought 1 was that character. 
All you do is keep working and people 
give you a different labeL" 

Because Linklater filmed in 
Vienna, the usual references to Ameri-
can popular culture are absent; how-
ever, Linklater said he wasn 't too 
worried about losing the audiences 
which attended his previous films. 

"One thing 1 liked about setting it 
in Europe was that it was divorced 
from American pop culture," Linklater 
said. "I didn 'twantto makea movie in 
which they are talking about Brady 
Bunch re-runs. I don 't have any Ted 
Nugent in this movie." 

The documentary styleofthe film, 
which includes no pecial effects or 
action scenes, is similarto Linklater's 
previous work. 

Linklater emphasized that Before 
SWlrise is about everyday experiences. 

"I think Pulp Fictioll is similar to 
my film . It shows all the practical 
realities of disposing bodies and c1ean-

in cinema- all the stuff they've been 
cutting out for 50 years." 

material. We can definitely get that 
rod thing going. Although I haven't 
had a good one in awhile." 

Lucki I y, ( was spared from Stem's 
vitriol. The reporter from SDSU's 
Daily Aztec wasn't so lucky. After 
being asked by Stem about the color 
of her hair and the size of her bust, the 
reporter asked whether he thought the 
New York Mets or the San Diego 
Padres were a worse baseball team. 
Stem responded by saying he didn't 
"give a rat's ass about baseball." He 
said, "I have no answer for that" and 
continued, "( know you're a college 
girl, but that's not a real good ques-
tion. At what point did you come up 
with that question? I wouldn't go into 
journalism if I were you. You should 
get a guy to support you." 

Stern's one redeeming quality is 
his brutal honesty. In interviews with 
celebrities, he often asks taboo ques-
tions about their sex lives and in-
comes. ln an era when talk show hosts 
soft-step around controversial issues 
with their guests, Stem's frankness is 
admirable and often funny. But is 
Stem's show as "cutting edge" as he 
says? Nah. He's just another white 
guy with an ax to grind and now he's 
grinding it in San Diego. He should fit 
right in.
