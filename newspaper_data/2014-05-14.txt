Che Cafe Closes Doors 
for On-Site Renovations

BY    Gabriella Fleischman  News Editor

UCSD’s Che Cafe will be closed dur-ing the next academic year while the building undergoes infrastruc-
ture renovations. 

University Centers Advisory Board 
Chair Sammy Chang told A.S. Council 
during its May 7 meeting that the facility 
need the constructural changes to be in 
compliance with safety regulations. 

During the renovation, the Che Cafe 
Co-operative — the current tenant of the 
Che Cafe facility and responsible party for 
planning events and maintaining opera-
tions at the cafe — will still organize events 
which will take place at Porter’s Pub over 
the next year.

“We need to try to balance the reserves. 
University centers started accumulating 
all these random projects, so now we’re 
running a deficit,” Chang said at the May 7 
meeting. “The fire marshal will close down 
the Che Café if the school doesn’t comply 
with all the expenses.” 

According to the facility report, the ren-
ovations will cost $1.5 million to complete 
in one fiscal year. University Centers spent 
$43,210.75 in the 2013–14 fiscal year on 
additional exit doors, outlets, signage (such 
as for exits, capacity limits and smoking), 
lock replacements and so forth.

University Centers plans to spend 
$854,212 toward the Che Cafe during the 
2014–15 fiscal year on restroom renova-
tions, fire sprinklers and alarms and opera-
tional expenses. Operational expenses are 
expected to cost $15,000 annually.

A draft of survey data on the priorities and 
use of University Centers resources showed 
that 83 percent of responders answered that 
they never attend shows at Che Cafe when 
they visit Price Center or the Student Center. 
Thirty-nine percent voted operating the Che 
facility as “very low priority,” while 37 percent 
selected “low priority.”

Opponents of the Che Cafe closure 
launched a change.org petition on May 13 
called “Save the Che from Closing!” The 
petition had 2,775 supporters at press time 
and proposed that Che Cafe remain oper-
ating until the university has enough funds 
to renovate the cafe. 

“The proposal to relocate the Che Cafe 
was given without underlying proof and 
documentation that the space is unsafe,” 
opposers claimed in the petition. “The 
repairs cited have been in their current 
condition without any health and safety 
incident for years, with the University never 
mentioning it until now as a reason to shut 
down even after the 2010 Facilities Report.”

Center for 
Wearable 
Sensors Set 
to Open

SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

Non-invasive sensors 
will monitor the patient’s 
cholesterol, blood glucose 
and heart rate in real-time.

BY  Justi n e  Liang 
senior  staff Writer

The UCSD Jacobs School of 
Engineering is creating a new Center 
for Wearable Sensors, officially 
scheduled to launch in June or July 
2014. Jacobs School of Engineering 
Dean Albert Pisano and nanoengi-
neering professor Joseph Wang are 
leading efforts to create the center. 
The goal of the center is to increase 
collaboration between researchers 
and faculty while supporting the 
local economy through the develop-
ment of wearable sensors that moni-
tor medical conditions in real-time.

“We want to recognize the talent 
of our engineering faculty and sup-
port the education and technology 
development in California and glob-
ally because of our unique combina-
tion of experts from across multiple 
disciplines,” Wang said.

The center consists of roughly 15 
to 20 faculty members from multiple 
disciplines such as nanoengineering, 
electrical engineering, mechanical 
engineering and computer science. 
Wearable sensors can include sen-
sors on clothes, temporary tattoos, 
patches or even implants. One of the 
goals is to make these wearable sen-
sors and electronics as low-powered 
and energy-efficient as possible. 
Professor Patrick Mercier, an assis-
tant professor of electrical engineer-
ing and computer science, leads one 
of the research focuses.

“We want to make sensors so 
low-powered that they don’t need 
to be recharged,” Mercier said. “We 
have been looking into various 
ways to harvest energy, whether it’s 
through body heat, motion, sweat or 
radio waves.”

According to Mercier, the 
research hopes to build technology 
that betters people’s lives and will 
accelerate the development of sen-
sors so that multiple sensors can be 
combined and streamlined.

“Here’s a car analogy: 20 years 
ago, cars didn’t have sensors, and 
you wouldn’t know that it was bro-
ken until smoke came out. Now, 
vehicles have over 100 different sen-
sors, of which many alert for major 
issues before they actually happen,” 
Mercier said. “That’s the same con-
cept as wearable sensors.”

The sensors would be worn at all 
times and constantly read out values 
of blood glucose, cholesterol, or heart 
rate. These vital signs would then be 
recorded and sent to doctors in their 
offices, allowing for quick diagnoses.

“All this data brings about the 
major issue of privacy,” Wang said. 
“We must address the fact that the 
data must be protected as needed.”

Most public concern is rooted 
in the rapidly advancing technol-

▶ Word Choice Affects Responsive of Children:
A new study suggests that adults who use 

nouns rather than verbs when talking to chil-
dren are more likely to prompt those children 
to act. UCSD, University of Washington and 
Stanford University researchers collaborated 
to complete the study, according to an April 30 
UCSD News Room report.

The study consisted of two experiments with 
about 150 children, ages 3 to 6, from differ-
ent ethnic, racial and economic backgrounds, 
both in which the adult talked to the children 
about helping. However, in one group, the adult 
referred to helping with a verb such as “help,” and 
in the other group, the adults talked about help-
ing by using a noun such as “helper.”

The results showed that children were sig-
nificantly more likely to help with certain tasks 
when adults talked to them about being “help-
ers” rather than “helping.” Moreover, when the 
adult experimenters used verb wording with 
the children, they were no more likely to help 
than the children who weren’t talked to at all 
about helping.

“Using the noun ‘helper’ may send a signal 
that helping implies something positive about 
one’s identity,” UCSD assistant professor of psy-

chology Christopher J. Bryan said. “[This] may 
in turn motivate children to help more.”

▶ Burn Victims Hospitalized at UCSD Medical Center:
Two burnt Chinese fishermen were 

transported to the UCSD Burn Unit in Hillcrest 
for emergency treatment after their vessel caught 
on fire in the Pacific Ocean on Friday, May 2.

Officials said that of the 17 total sailors, six 
were missing and four were badly burnt, with 
only two surviving their injuries. The remaining 
sailors were in good condition and are set to be 
return home.The Air Force Rescue Coordination 
Center received an emergency rescue request at 
5 p.m. on Friday and deployed the 563rd Rescue 
Group under Maj. Sarah Schwennesen at the 
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base to conduct the 
rescue mission. 

Schwennesen told NBC 7 San Diego that 
the distance to reach the sailors was the most 
challenging. The rescue aircraft was dispatched 
from the Arizona Air National Guard in Phoenix, 
Arizona and took approximately 11 hours to fly 
across the Pacific Ocean.

ogy and ease at which personal 
information can be accessed online. 
According to Mercier, it is definitely 
something that the people designing 
the sensors are concerned about and 
will take into account.

Dr. Larry Smarr, the founding 
director of the California Institute 
for Telecommunications and 
Information Technology, shares 
some of these concerns. 

“Fundamentally, you have to 
start with the realization that there 
is a very large societal good that is 
served by sharing your data,” Smarr 
said. “Because to understand your 
values of heart rate, staphs, any-
thing, you need to understand what 
the variation [of it] is in the human 
population. Getting population-
wide sharing of data is essential for 
interpretation for the individual.”

Smarr feels that sharing the data 
is necessary and essential, but that 

protective measures must be taken 
in terms of laws and regulations. 
Laws that protect the individual 
must be created and maintained to 
create a safe place for the mass shar-
ing of data.

“It’s [sharing data] like anything 
in life; things are always a tradeoff,” 
Smarr said. “You get some value, but 
you must take some risks.”

the undergraduate student interns 
will be expected to travel to Tijuana 
to volunteer at the clinic every week. 

According to Student Coordinator 
Daniel Yee, the undergraduate stu-
dent interns primarily take care of 
record keeping.

“The program has been very 
successful,” Yee said. “It’s still going 
through growing pains, but it’s helped 
so much for the records. We’re cap-
turing a lot more information than 
before. It helps out with the quality of 

care we can have at the clinic because 
[we] don’t need to worry about [the] 
administrative side.”

Additionally, the interns take 
patients’ vitals and participate in 
consultations if space permits. 
Currently, there are 12 undergradu-
ate student volunteer interns, and 
unless the clinic grows, there are no 
plans to expand the undergraduate 
internship program.

“[The student interns have] defi-
nitely shown a high level of commit-
ment,” Yee said. “It takes a lot of time 
to get to the clinic, and coming back 

you have to wait at the border which 
can sometimes take a few hours. The 
students are volunteering their time. 
They’re very passionate about health-
care for the underserved, and they’re 
willing to give up their entire Saturday 
to volunteer at the clinic.”

Applications to the 2014 HFiT 
summer sessions will be accepted 
until the end of Week 7 of Spring 
Quarter 2014 and can be found at 
meded.ucsd.edu.

   Time for a Change 
BY  LAUREN  KOA     managing editor

Scientists, researchers and engineers — some of whom hail from our very own campus — are ready to serve up wearable technology that might change the world as we know it. Instead 
of simply including the usual text messaging, email reading or web-
surfing capabilities that can be found on the average smartphone, sci-
entists have developed interesting devices that can significantly affect 
treatment for those with diabetes and high blood pressure or those 
recovering from wounds. With innovative devices in the development 
pipeline, these new types of wearable smart technology have the rare 
opportunity to improve public health and the lives of many.

The technology industry may just be headed toward the most 
innovative, game-changing line of inventions since Steve Jobs cre-
ated the iPhone. With far more benefits than the convenience of 
having one’s iPod and cellphone morphed into one, the industry’s 
shift toward creating personalized, wearable smart devices with 
health in mind is its best move yet. 

Wearable technology has much more to offer than the typical 
heart rate meters or step-counting pedometers. In fact, last January, 
Google announced that it’s in the process of developing a line of 
smart contact lenses that can help individuals living with diabetes. 
The lenses use a tiny, wireless chip to determine the glucose levels 
in the wearer’s tears, allowing more accuracy in monitoring blood 
sugar levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have 

charted an upward trend of Americans diagnosed with diabetes, 
nearly quadrupling from 5.8 million diagnoses in 1980 to 20.9 mil-
lion in 2011. If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, 
these smart contact lenses could improve the health of many diabet-
ics by offering them a better, more consistent way to monitor their 
glucose levels, as well as potentially ending the inconvenience of 
pricking fingers to test blood levels.

The benefits of wearable smart technology can even extend to 
the armed forces, athletics, and power generation. Over recent years, 
UCSD faculty, researchers and students have made significant strides 
in demonstrating how wearable smart devices can be utilized to 
advance a diverse amount of fields and professions. A lab overseen 
by UCSD nanoengineering professor Joseph Wang has made many 
accomplishments through its research and projects which involve 
integrating sensors into temporary tattoos, Navy SEAL wetsuits, 
“smart” bandages and even saliva-analyzing mouthguards. 

The lab’s team of nanoengineers found that its temporary tattoos 
can generate electricity from sweat and monitor fetal heart rates, 
while the electrochemical sensors integrated onto Navy SEAL wet-
suits can detect water contamination or nearby explosives. According 
to a recent San Diego Union-Tribune piece, the team has also devel-
oped bandages that can be used to determine how quickly a wound 
is healing and mouthguards that can detect both stress and hydration

QUICK  TAKES THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION HAS RECENTLY BEGUN MOBILIZING RESOURCES TO ERADICATE MALARIA AND SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES THROUGH RESEARCH AND INTERVENTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

Mosquitoes kill 725,000 people a year world-
wide by transmitting diseases like malaria and yel-
low fever. So, when a billionaire and international 
philanthropist like Bill Gates is spending millions 
on mosquito awareness and research towards cures 
and eventual eradication of these diseases, it doesn’t 
seem like a bad idea. However, the resources fun-
neled into these programs should be devoted to 
alleviating the underlying causes of these illnesses. 

Access to water is a severe problem, with 
approximately 3.4 million people worldwide dying 
each year from associated diseases. And, if the 
deaths from diseases not being properly treated 
because of a lack of clean water are included, that 
number steadily grows larger. For someone trying 
to bring down a high fever or perform an emer-
gency procedure, clean water can be the difference 
between life and death. 

Additionally, United Nations Emergency Fund 
statistics show that 22,000 children die every day 
from poverty-related health issues. It’s quite clear 
that most who die from diseases like malaria are at 
increased risk due to substandard living conditions.

Undoubtedly, the Gates Foundation and its 
benefactors have an honorable mission. A private 
donation to better the lives of the less fortunate 
shows rare compassion. Gates’s initiatives to 
increase awareness of mosquitoes and the diseases 
they transmit are a great start, but future efforts 
would be better served by trying to solve what is at 
the root of so many international problems.

Vaccines Are the Most Effective 
Method to Eradicate Malaria 

Mosquitoes Must be Exterminated in 
Order to Prevent Further Casualties

Resources Should be Used to Target 
Underlying Causes of  Illness

Humankind has historically been locked in a 
struggle to eradicate mosquitoes as disease trans-
mitters, and efforts to wipe out these pests are cer-
tainly needed in every continent.

Mosquitoes are a problem everywhere in the 
world because they are one of the most common 
vectors of disease. According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 114 deaths were 
reported from the mosquito-transmitted West 
Nile Virus in the United States in 2013. Americans 
still live in the shadow of mosquito diseases, even 
though we may feel insulated from the problem.

Developing nations, most notably in Africa, 
have had extreme difficulty in trying to eradicate 
diseases, including malaria. According to the World 
Health Organization, half of the world’s population 
is at risk of infection; there are 207 million cases of 
malaria worldwide, and 607,000 of these cases have 
resulted in death. Although malaria-related deaths 
have decreased by 42 percent since 2000, attempts to 
eradicate the mosquito altogeth        er can eliminate 
pathways for the transmission of various diseases. 

While the United States has done a good job of 
suppressing malaria, the myriad other diseases mos-
quitoes cause are a huge problem in the developing 
world, as new mosquito-borne diseases can evolve 
and cause even more devastation. It is important 
that although United States may not feel like they 
have a stake in the war against mosquitoes, we have 
just as much of a duty in this globalized society to 
prevent these diseases from spreading.

—  HUGO WONG
Contributing Writer

While malaria isn’t prominent in the U.S., it 
is a leading cause of death in various developing 
tropical countries. Although efforts to address this 
disease have been able to curtail casualties, it is 
imperative that research for vaccines is continued.

Malaria is caused by a parasite commonly 
found in mosquitoes and transmitted by mosquito 
bites. According to CNN’s Matt Smith and William 
Hudson, current efforts to prevent malaria are cen-
tered on active protective measures, including the 
use of pesticides and nets. Yet malaria still manages 
to kill more than 600,000 people a year. Many trav-
elers are also especially prone to being affected by 
this disease if it isn’t endemic at home.

However, according to an article in the New 
York Times, clinical trials treating over 15,000 
patients with a GlaxoSmithKline vaccine have 
shown a 46-percent decrease in cases of malaria for 
infants 5 to 17 months old at the time of vaccina-
tion. Regardless, the vaccine, which may be imple-
mented as early as 2015, illustrates a significant step 
toward the possibility of avoiding this deadly dis-
ease, taking passive preventive steps to prevent alto-
gether the need for treatment later on. Some may 
believe that eradicating mosquitoes is the solution; 
however, as the Gates Foundation states, with the 
source of malaria being the parasites themselves, 
eliminating the carriers would not suffice.  

Vaccinations attempt to prevent parasites from 
thriving and may provide the ultimate solution to 
eliminating malaria.

Appreciate 
the Special
Privilege of  
Siblinghood

There is no one on Earth able to inspire such feelings of affection, jealousy, 
competition and pride as only a 
sibling can. They irritate us, steal 
our Legos, steal our attention and 
somehow we still like them at the 
end of the day. It’s rare in human 
relationships to be able to get away 
with so much mischief and still be 
the object of so much endearment. 
But somehow, they do it.

Siblingship is quite a 
paradoxical relationship, given 
that siblings are, by nature, both 
our truest allies and our fiercest 
competitors. In a sense, they are 
a reflection of us: In genetics as 
well as in spirit, they tend to share 
the biological and environmental 
influences that define who we are. 
Though there may be a few minor 
differences, at the end of the day, 
they are essentially the closest thing 
to ourselves that we will ever find. 

Evolutionarily, as is seen in 
other animals, siblings have always 
been an adversary in trying to 
claim parental resources and 
attention. We are, of course, not 
inclined to share with them — we 
fight over the last taquitos at the 
dinner table, shove them during 
backyard soccer and willfully try to 
outdo them in front of our parents. 
But with this competition comes a 
transformative experience. From 
the moment we lay our wondering 
eyes on them, they force us to 
realize that we are not, in fact, the 
center of the universe — that there’s 
a bigger or littler “me” out there, 
someone who presumably sees us 
as either an older confidant or a 
younger protege.

Despite the natural competition, 
whether in foot races or spitting 
contests, only a brother could 
remain friend number one for so 
long. Through all of the fistfights 
and property destruction, the 
means of forgiveness that only a 
sibling could employ or elicit is 
amazingly powerful, preventing us 
from ever holding a grudge.

Perhaps it’s because we know 
we’ll be stuck with them anyway 
and see them the next day. Or 
maybe it’s because we’re able to 
connect with them more than with 
anyone else — able to vicariously 
experience their pain and their 
happiness. Regardless, any kicking 
and scratching and the simmering 
silence that follows is inevitably 
broken by a resigned attempt to 
restart a conversation and sheepish 
grins on both sides.

As a result of this essentially 
unbreakable dynamic, this 
relationship is an interesting 
case study in power psychology. 
Younger siblings learn over time 
to endure the typically unbalanced 
hierarchy of strength, but look up 
to their older siblings over time, 
often emulating their affectations 
and opinions. Older siblings are 
more or less free to lord it over 
our younger counterparts and 
often exploit this. And yet they 
are so fiercely protective and so 
inseparably attached, ready to 
obliterate at a moment’s notice 
anyone other than themselves 
accused of harrassing their sibling. 

Although I’m over two hundred 
miles away from my best friend, 
eternal tormentor and first 
legitimate ‘bro,’ we still share a 
special connection. I may not 
have always appreciated having a 
brother, but it is truly a wonderful 
and special privilege.

Thinking Caps

The development of new wearable technology represents an industry shift from
convenience and leisure to more productive applications. 



levels of its wearers. In light of its 
innovative success, the Jacobs School 
of Engineering announced its future 
plans to create a Center for Wearable 
Devices during its Research Expo in 
April 2014. With more facilities for 
research, people are only expecting 
more breakthroughs from the San 
Diego community.

The future opportunities for 
these technologies are endless and 
will be worth quelling the fears 
that current wearable smart devices 
have created. When people today 
think of wearable smart technol-
ogy, Google Glass is usually is the 
first thing to come to mind. Glass 
has made numerous headlines and 

sold out its limited units at $1,500 
apiece in mid-April, but has received 
little praise and a fair share of criti-
cism. Due to the limited privacy that 
Google Glass’ audio and video 
recording options and built-in cam-
era may permit, many people are 
rightfully concerned that Google 
Glass can be invasive.

However, it’s important to keep 
in mind that all wearable technol-
ogy is made with different goals 
and purposes. People fear wearable 
tech for many wrong reasons, likely 
because they are unaware of its dif-
ferent kinds of benefits. The privacy 
concerns from Google Glass are not 
at all representative of what all wear-
able smart devices are or should be. 
And while people probably should 

not jump ship to support every new 
piece of wearable tech, there are rea-
sons to be optimistic of this industry 
and what is to come.

The ability to personalize wear-
able devices will ultimately allow 
society to integrate technology in a 
way that isn’t cookie cutter for the 
masses. The health benefits that 
these cutting-edge devices offer can 
herald a new era for technology and 
an increasingly helpful integration 
of different machines into our lives. 
It’s time to look past reinventing 
the smartphone and focus more 
on improving smart technology on 
other fronts as well.

Dear Editor,
At UCSD, parking for students 

has become a huge problem due 
to the lack of parking structures. 
I have been told that this lack 
of accommodating parking is 
part of a process to “go green.” I 
completely support a movement 
to “go green.” However, I do not 
believe that this is a reasonable 
way to look at the problem. In an 
area like San Diego, transportation 
by car is extremely important in 
order to enjoy everything that it 
has to offer. Therefore, I propose 
alternative ideas.

First, I believe that the school 
should offer varying parking 
prices determined by the efficiency 
of each car. This would give an 
incentive to everyone to drive 
more fuel-efficient cars — or even 
start a greater movement toward 
electric cars. If we were to put a 
heavy price on parking passes for 
gas-guzzling cars, then we would 
be able to get people to move 
away from these vehicles. I know 
that one issue would be figuring 
out how much should be charged 
for each different type of car, but 
this shouldn’t be impossible to 
handle. With a computer science 
department as great as the one 
here at UCSD, I couldn’t imagine 
this problem being that hard to fix. 
Information about car efficiency 
is easily accessible and students 
already have to declare what kind 

of car they have in order to receive 
their parking pass. If we could 
write a simple computer code that 
would weigh different types of fuel 
efficiency with other factors that 
contribute to being environmentally 
friendly and have it output a price 
that correlates, we could create 
a better incentive to “go green” 
than the way we are now. Simply 
restricting parking is unfair and 
does not offer students incentives 
to buy fuel-efficient cars that will 
be used outside of school.

Secondly, I believe UCSD needs 
to offer more opportunities for 
electric cars and start a greater 
movement toward solar power. 
We need more electric charging 
stations for cars that could be 
powered by solar energy. 

If we were to build more parking 
structures to finally accommodate 
the amount of students enrolled in 
this school, it would be a great idea 
to engineer these parking structures 
in a way that would take advantage 
of solar power. We could place solar 
panels on the top that would power 
the electric cars and all the lighting 
needed for a parking structure.

These two proposed ideas 
actually give students incentives 
to use more fuel-efficient cars 
inside and outside of their college 
experience. I believe we can do 
better at going green than just 
limiting student parking to the 
point that they have to park miles 
away from campus and hope that 
they aren’t late for class.

O
ne in every 125 peo-
ple aged 15 to 49 are 
affected by HIV in 
Tijuana, Mexico, 
according to a study 

conducted in 2006 by Dr. Kimberly Brouwer 
of the Division of Global Public Health at the 
UC San Diego School of Medicine. Health 
Frontiers in Tijuana is a free health clinic run 
by UCSD faculty and medical students dedi-
cated to providing basic healthcare to under-
served populations to combat widespread 
health issues such as HIV.

Each year, HFiT offers an internship at 

their Tijuana health clinic to 
graduate medical students at 
UCSD and this year, for the first 
time, undergraduates will be 
offered the same opportunity for 

hands-on clinical experience. The expan-
sion, says Associate Dean of Global Health 
Sciences Steffanie Strathdee, is beneficial to 
both students and the public.

“There is such a great need for global 
health training opportunities all across the 
campus,” Strathdee said. “[With] the launch 
of UCSD’s global health minor, and a new 
global health major that is about to begin,

Over a year ago, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College fifth-year senior Nathan Klarer 
came home excited to tell friend and 
roommate, class of 2011 alumnus AJ 
Cawood, about an idea he had been 
incubating. Klarer, a bioengineering 
major, had a new idea — a health 
monitoring interface that he intend-
ed for industry use — that Cawood 
believed had great potential in haz-
ardous industries. Last February, they 
launched their very own company, 
BridgeCrest Medical. This past March, 
they made a deal with their first, major 
international client.

BridgeCrest is a digital platform 
that runs diagnostics from medical 
devices connected via Bluetooth and 
displays the data on a tablet or other 
mobile device and stores the data for 
analytics. The platform is Bluetooth 
compatible with certain monitors 
used to measure health data, including 
blood pressure, lung function, hearing 
loss and drug use. 

“BridgeCrest is designed to go out 
to remote locations where there isn’t 
any existing health infrastructure,” 
Cawood said.

The Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration requires indus-
tries to take preventative measures in 
the workplace. BridgeCrest adds to this 
preventative mindset.

“[Companies] can catch differ-
ent health trends before they become 
problematic and make sure that the 
workers at the site have the highest 
quality of health,” Klarer said.

Though the new company remains 
a small team of 11, mostly software 
engineers, it has progressed quickly. 

BridgeCrest has already secured a big 
client in Africa whose name could not 
be released. This connection puts them 
closer to their goal of reaching more 
countries. Next month, they plan to 
reach out to other countries in South 
America and Africa, in addition to 
North America.

Cawood claims that their solution 
received a cascade of positive feedback 
at the Prospectors and Developers 
Association of Canada Convention, a 
large mining convention that was held 
in Toronto, Canada of March this year. 
This was where they met their interna-
tional client.

“There hasn’t really been any major 
mobile technology [in medical diag-
nostics],” Cawood said. “[Companies] 
are pretty excited that the tablets that 
they’re used to can provide this kind 
of insight.”

They credit their success to a net-
work of contacts in the medical and 
business field. BridgeCrest features a 
board of directors whose purpose is to 
consult on the latest in medical tech-
nology. Dr. Steven Steinhubl, director 
for Digital Medicine at the Scripps 
Translational Science Institute, is only 
one of the many board members. 

“We partner with the top mobile 
device experts in the world,” Klarer 
said. “The makers of these [diagnostic] 
devices come to Scripps to have their 
devices validated because Scripps is 
really the leading institution in the 
world for mobile medicine … The 
devices that Dr. Steinhubl likes he will 
recommend to us, and then we decide 
if we want to incorporate that technol-
ogy into the platform or not.”

Cawood and Klarer have come a 
long way from the days when they 
had to juggle both coursework and 
the founding of their company. When 

asked about how they handled their 
obligations between their educa-
tion and their company, Klarer and 
Cawood laughed, noting that they 
squeezed as much work as they could 
into their spare time.

As for future plans, Cawood and 
Klarer are set to conduct a study in 
South America where they will be 
employing and integrating wearable 

devices with their platform. They hope 
to direct their platform toward non-
profit purposes. 

“We want to take what we have 
done [in the mining gap] and direct 
it into the nonprofit sector,” Cawood 
said. “This concept not only has value 
in the corporate sector but also on 
world governments, nonprofit groups 
like the Red Cross and Doctors 

Without Borders ... We want to make 
an impact on poor populations.”

After around a year of managing 
BridgeCrest, Cawood and Klarer are 
confident and optimistic about their 
company’s future.

“We think what we have is pret-
ty unique, and we’ll be pushing the 
boundaries of what’s been done,” 
Cawood said.

the demand from undergraduates 
was compelling. Our team is happy to 
involve more students as that means 
we can offer more educational oppor-
tunities but also more free care to 
Tijuana’s poor.”

Dr. Strathdee, who leads an 
HIV prevention research program 
in Tijuana funded by the National 
Institutes of Health, has been working 
for over 10 years with sex workers and 
intravenous drug users.

“Since these populations are so 
marginalized, they often come to us for 
medical care, which we cannot provide 
as a research study,” she said. “That has 
always bothered me.”

About five years ago, a group of 
medical students and faculty at the 
UC San Diego School of Medicine 
suggested a graduate course that 
would be designed around a free 
student health clinic in Tijuana, the 
very place in which Strathdee’s team 
had been conducting research for 
several years. After three years of 
processing to get the course approved 
as a pre-clinical elective for medicine 
and pharmacy students, HFiT was 
established in April 2011.

Open every weekend from 10 a.m. 
to about 2 p.m., the walk-in clinic is a 
collaborative project between UCSD 
and the Universidad Autonoma de 
Baja California, with medical students 
from both universities volunteering at 
the health clinic. Strathdee notes the 
example that UCSD sets for other uni-
versities in the realm of global health.

“HFiT is now run by a binational 
team of physicians, researchers, 
students, and NGO partners,” 
Strathdee said. “As I am the associate 
dean of global health sciences at 
UCSD, I see HFiT as a real binational 
model, one that other universities are 
interested in replicating.” 

The clinic is located in the Zona 
Norte area of downtown Tijuana near 
the red light district. The student 

volunteers treat many patients who are 
sex workers, especially those who are 
female and transsexual. Also nearby 
is the Tijuana River canal, which is 
a sewer canal that becomes home to 
many Mexican deportees who don’t 
have any form of ID and thus cannot 
get access to Mexico’s universal health 
care. Medical students treat many of 
these homeless deportees for HIV 
and other intravenous drug-related 
diseases, Student Coordinator Daniel 
Yee said, a recently graduated Masters 
student in biology. He explained that 
because drugs that are trafficked 

through the canal to the U.S. are 
often left in the canal, they become 
readily available to individuals living 
there, causing an increase in drug use 
in the area.

Currently, there are 12 undergrad-
uate student interns that see around 
30 patients total every weekend. Due 
to limited funding, all interns are vol-
unteers and all medical supplies are 
donations. Yee discussed his experi-
ence with the program’s lack of fund-
ing and its consequences.

“We’re not well funded right now,” 
Yee said. “It’s hard sometimes. A 

patient will come in [seeking a cer-
tain medicine] but maybe we’re out 
of it. The best thing we can do is write 
them a prescription. Most of them 
are very impoverished, [and] writing 
them a prescription doesn’t necessar-
ily mean they can get the meds.”

Dr. Strathdee agreed that the 
lack of funding is problematic, sug-
gesting that increased funding for 
equipment and a more regular staff 
would allow the project to become 
much more widespread, both in 
its opportunity for student clinical 
experience and in its health care 

provision to underserved individu-
als in Tijuana. 

“We would love to expand the 
program but resources are scant,” 
she said. “We now have set the 
clinic up as a charitable organization 
and have received modest funds, 
but there is only enough funding 
to keep the clinic open a few days 
a week. With greater institutional 
support, we could expand much 
more broadly.”

Tritons Earn Automatic NCAA Bid, Head Next to Regionals

“He got me earlier in my previous 
at bat,” La Face said. “I got behind, 
and he caught me looking on a 
slider [in the earlier at bat], so I was 
just looking to get on a fastball early. 
If I got one, I was going to take a 
good hack at it, so that’s all I was 
thinking.” 

UCSD entered the championship 
game in a rematch against Chico 
State on Saturday night. It looked 
like the Tritons would cruise to the 
tournament crown after racking up 
a 6–0 edge after five full innings. 
However, in an incredible turn of 
events, the Wildcats rallied for a 
whopping seven runs in the top 
of the sixth to take the lead. Cruz 
allowed five runs, and senior right-

hander David Hart allowed two 
more in relief. 

The Tritons still appeared 
unphased, batting in four runs over 
the following three innings to shut 
out the Wildcats for a win of 10–7 to 
take the championship. Sophomore 
right-hander Justin Donatella earned 
the win after pitching through 3.2 
scoreless innings in relief and a bases-
loaded situation in the seventh. 

UCSD head coach Eric Newman 
expressed pride in the Tritons’ 
ability to consistently string together 
comeback wins in big moments. 

“Our players believe in our 
system,” Newman said. “We’ve put it 
in play, and they’ve done a great job 
all year long. As [coaches], it’s up to 
us to trust the players to go out there 
and do what we talk about, and they 

did a great job of that.” 
With the 2014 CCAA crown, 

UCSD has now won the title in 
five of the last six seasons. La Face 
also earned the tournament’s Most 
Valuable Player award, recording six 
hits in 13 at bats and tallying the 
ever-crucial walk-off double against 
Cal Poly Pomona. 

The Tritons will next look to 
make a mark at the national level as 
they prepare to host the NCAA West 
Regionals in the number one seed. 
The Tritons will face sixth-seeded 
Sonoma State at Triton Ballpark in 
the first round on Thursday, May 
15.  Regionals will run Thursday, 
through Sunday, May 18.

UCSD Concludes 2014 Season with 27–13 Overall Record

faced Indiana University for seventh 
place, but ultimately fell in a hard-
luck 9–8 loss. 

The first quarter had both squads 
totaling seven goals as the Tritons 
trailed 4–3 entering the second. In-
diana University put in two more 
goals in the second period, while the 
Tritons scored one. Down by two 
entering the second half, the Tritons 
outscored the Hoosiers 4–3 in the 
final two quarters but failed to get 

that one extra goal needed to knot 
the game up. 

With the three losses, the eighth-
place Tritons failed to improve from 
last year’s sixth place finish. Wieseler 
led UCSD with 10 goals throughout 
the tournament. Four graduating 
seniors — center Melissa Bartow, 
2MD Allison Delgado, utility Leah 
Gonzales and Lizotte — concluded 
their collegiate careers. 

Lizotte, who scored a total of 
eight goals, finishes with 26 goals 
scored in the NCAA Champion-

ships, only four goals short of the 
NCAA record of 30 set by Stanford 
University’s Lauren Silver. She also 
leaves as the all-time leader in goals 
and assists for UCSD. 

“It’s very sentimental when you 
have to play the last game of the 
year,” Kreutzkamp said. “We had a 
good senior class and it was tough to 
lose a tight game, [but] we have tons 
of talent returning.”

Young Triton Squad Looks Optimistically Toward Next Season

holes left,” junior Jay Lim said. “We 
were never in that situation before, 
so it was a really good experience to 
know how it was like. [At] the end, we 
just fell apart a little bit, collectively.”

UCSD head coach Jim Ragan 
noted that having such a young 
team played a large role in the third 
round’s collapse.

“There were a number of factors, 
but I think inexperience was one, so I 
think we can grow from that,” Ragan 
said. ”We were playing good enough 
to get one of those late-tee times 
along with the leading teams, and we 
just didn’t handle the wind very well.”

Yang was the top finisher for 
UCSD, placing 32nd out of 108 in-
dividuals and hitting a 227, 11 over 
par. Following closely behind was 
Lewis and sophomore Clayton Ya-

maguchi, both of whom finished 
42nd, swinging 13 over par. To 
round off the lineup, sophomore Jeff 
Roseth tied for 96th while Lim fin-
ished tying for 104th. 

The incredibly competitive South 
Central/West Region includes seven 
of the nation’s top 25 teams. No. 18 St. 
Edward’s University took first place, 
while California Collegiate Athletic 
Association squads No. 5 Chico State 
and No. 3 Cal State Monterey Bay fin-
ished second and fourth, respectively. 

With four of the five players who 
competed in Regionals returning 
next year, the Tritons look toward the 
coming seasons with optimism. 

“They’re used to being here [now],” 
Ragan said. “Second time around 
with us being in the mix to advance, 
they see what it’s like. At least they 
saw what you had to do in the final 
round to actually push through [and] 

make it through, and I know that will 
help us out in the future.”

The Regional Tournament 
capped off a solid, albeit inconsis-
tent, season for the Tritons. After 
starting the season off strong, UCSD 
hit a midseason slump but ended on 
a high note with a third-place finish 
at the CCAA championships. De-
spite the on-and-off season, UCSD 
has gained newfound confidence for 
next season. 

“We have the talent to compete,” 
Lim said. “I think we’re far better 
than what it says on paper, and I 
think that’s definitely a confidence 
booster moving onto next year. No 
matter what the numbers say, I think 
we definitely have a great shot at 
winning the national title next year.”

variation. The aim of this symposium is to take a fresh look at 
the causes and consequences of variation in aggression, both 
between and within species. The expert panel of speakers will 
critically examine and represent the available evidence from 
multiple sources, including comparative ethology, ethnology, 
archaeology, political science, and evolutionary neuroscience.

The UCSD men’s golf team 
wrapped up its season Wednes-
day, May 7 in its third consecutive 
NCAA South Central/West Region-
al Tournament appearance, placing 
16th of 20 schools in the three-day 
tournament at Grey Rock Golf Club 
in Austin, Texas.

Shooting for a spot in the top six 
places in order to qualify for nation-
als, the Tritons were tied at sixth early 
in round one but failed to maintain 
their standing as they dropped to 
11th at the end of the day. Sophomore 
Daniel Yang had the best first-round 
performance of UCSD’s lineup, hit-
ting a 74, two strokes over par, high-
lighted by a chip from behind the 

green to eagle the 17th hole.
The Tritons improved by eight 

strokes during day two. Senior Lewis 
Simon was the only Triton to score 
under par, hitting a 71 on the par-72 
course, allowing the Tritons to climb 
up to the eighth spot at the end of 
round two.

The final round was disappointing 
for the Tritons as they hit a team total 
of 317, 20 strokes behind their round 
two total. UCSD’s 317 was the high-
est score of its round and the second 
highest of all three days, only behind 
St. Mary College’s first-round score of 
323. The Tritons fell to 16th and were 
ultimately disqualified from the Na-
tional Championships.

to Finish 16th at Regionals

W.  WATER  POLO  GOLF

UCSD goes 0–3 at nationals, loses to UCLA, UC Irvine, Indiana to conclude season.

The No. 12 UCSD women’s water 
polo team traveled to Los Angeles 
this past weekend to take part in  the 
NCAA Championship but failed to 
keep up with the rest of the pack. 
Finishing in eighth place, the Tri-
tons dropped games to UCLA, UC 
Irvine and Indiana University to 
conclude its 2014 campaign with a 
27–13 overall record.

UCSD was quickly eliminated 
from national title contention after 
losing 12–8 against No. 2 power-
house UCLA in the first round of 
finals play. 

While the Bruins jumped to a 
quick lead with a pair of goals, the 
Tritons finished the opening quarter 
with a close 2–1 score as sophomore 
attacker Julia Kirkland responded, 
placing UCSD on the scoreboard. 

In spite of the first quarter’s tight 
result, UCLA broke out in the sec-
ond frame. The Bruins netted three 
goals while shutting the Tritons out, 
ending the half with a 5–1 score. 

“In order to beat that type of 
team, we have to come out playing 
relaxed,” senior utility Sarah Lizotte 
told the UCSD Athletics Depart-
ment. “I’m not sure we did that early, 
but we did coming out of halftime, 
and the early part of the third quar-
ter was probably our best stretch.” 

The Tritons entered the third 
quarter with two quick goals from 

sophomore 2MD Alexis Wieseler 
and junior attacker Jolene Guiliana 
to cut the deficit to two at a 5–3 
score. However, UCLA fired back 
with three unanswered goals to ex-
tend the lead to 8–3 at the end of the 
third quarter. A high-scoring final 
frame did little for the Tritons, who 
ultimately fell 12–8. 

Lizotte and Wieseler both fin-
ished with a hat trick each. 

“We wanted to make sure we gave 
everything we could and make them 
work for anything they got — I think 
we did that,” UCSD head coach Brad 
Kreutzkamp said. “We didn’t play 
mistake-free, but we never quit. I 
was definitely happy about the effort 
out there today.” 

After the Tritons were relegated 
to the tournament’s losing bracket, 
UCSD faced UC Irvine on Saturday. 
Though the Tritons took an early 
advantage from a Wieseler goal, the 
No. 6 Anteaters would score three 
goals in response and retain the lead 
for the rest of the match. 

UCSD entered the fourth quarter 
trailing by only two at 11–9 but UC 
Irvine broke out in the final period, 
scoring six goals to win 17–11. Wi-
eseler finished the match with five 
goals, while Lizotte and Guiliana 
each had a pair of goals. 

In their final game of the tourna-
ment and of the season, the Tritons

Late game heroics and clutch play propelled the No. 18 UCSD baseball team to a perfect California 
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament 
record as it reclaimed the conference title 
this past Saturday in Stockton, California. 
Led by six All-CCAA Team members, the 
third-seeded Tritons went 3–0 through 
the championship series. Their top 
performance earned UCSD the number 
one seed and homefield advantage for the 
NCAA Regionals. 

In the tournament opener on Thursday 
night, the Tritons faced off first against 
No. 9 Chico State. With junior left-handed 
pitcher Trevor Scott on the mound for 
UCSD, the second-seeded Wildcats took 
an early 1–0 lead in the bottom of the first. 

After the first frame, both squads went 
scoreless until the fifth inning, during 
which the Tritons tallied two off of four 
walks and a single run batted in from 
senior shortstop Garrett Tuck. 

However, the Wildcats responded with 
two runs of their own in the other half of 
the fifth to regain the advantage. Though 
down a run, UCSD drove a score in during 
the eighth, forcing both squads to enter 
the ninth inning tied at three. With two 
outs in the ninth, Tuck came up in the 

clutch, knocking in a two-run double to 
ultimately give UCSD the win.

“I tried not to make it that big of a 
moment,” Tuck told the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “We were tied, and I knew if 
I got out, nothing terribly bad was going 
to happen. We were just going to keep 
playing, so I just took it as another at bat, 
and it went my way.”  

On Friday night, the Tritons continued 
their impressive, last-minute play as UCSD 
recorded an extra-inning, walk-off victory 
against No. 19 California State Polytechnic 
University Pomona. The Tritons took a 
1–0 lead in the third, only to have the 
Mustangs plate two runs of their own in 
the fifth to flip the advantage. UCSD had 
a big inning in the seventh as four straight 
walks doomed the Mustangs, allowing the 
Tritons to take three runs. 

Despite the 4–2 lead, the Mustangs 
responded in the top of the ninth with two 
runs, ruining senior right-handed pitcher 
Scott Zeman’s potential save. 

With two outs in the bottom of the 11th 
inning, junior second baseman Erik Lewis 
drew a walk to reach base. Then, senior 
catcher Nick La Face took to the plate and 
knocked in an RBI double on his second 
pitch to give UCSD the walk off victory.
