Conde's Personality Central 
Issue of 3rd District Race 

by Sara Lowen 
Community Editor 

The Third District Supervisorial 
race has centered as much on the 
personality and perfonnance of 
Supervisor Lou Conde as on the 
issues. 

All those competing for Conde's 
seat have said that Conde's 
unresponsiveness to his con-
stituency was a factor in their 
decisions to run. 

The challengers in the race are: 
Nancy Bradshaw, a biologist; Jim 
Burton, an ex-policeman; J. Bruce 
Henderson, an attorney; Roger 
Hedgecock, an attorney; and Bill 
Mitchell, a realtor. 

One of Conde's opponents has 
criticized Conde's alleged ties to 
the Secret Army Organization and 
the Minutemen, two right wing 
organizations active in the 1960s 
and early 1970s. Conde has denied 
involvement with the 
organizations, though Howard 
Berry Godfrey, a member of the 
Minutement and an FBI in-
fonnant, implicated Conde in right 
wing activities. 

Conde has 'admitted to at-
tempting to hang UCSD philosophy 
professor emeritus Herbert 
Marcu.c;e in effigy in 1967, as well as 
disrupting a Peace and Freedom 
party open house. 

Meetings with Constituents 
The issue of responsiveness . to 

the votes is the main focus of 
Burton's campaign. Burton 
charges that Conde has failed to 
involve people in the decision-
making process. If elected, Burton 
says he would · hold regular 
meetings with his constituents, 
publiciZe the times of Boctrd of 
Supervisors meetings and install a 
hotline to his office for direct 
communication with his con-
stituents. 

Mitchell said that Conde's giving 
himself a raise after opposing pay 
raises for supervisors also inspired 

Clarification 
In Monday's article ' about the 

end of hearings against 10 UC San 
Diego students charged with 
violations of UC regulations, the 
Triton Times reported that 
charged student Maia McGehee 
testified Friday she feU 
"pressured by the crowd behind 
her" during President Saxon's 
walk from USB 2622 to the Chan-
cellor's complex. 

She told the Triton Times 
Monday she testified the crowd 
was " pressed," not that she felt 
pressured, and that the crowd 
around Saxon was in front of her as 
she walked backwards, her arms 
linked with other demonstrators. 

McGehee also said Monday she 
had not specifically tl!Stified that 
Deputy Vice-chancellor Richard 
Whitehill's arms had been raised 
" like a football player," but just 
that they had been raised. 

him to run. "You don't campaign 
on an issue, then turn around and 
give yourself a raise," Mitchell 
said. 

Conde denies the charge that he 
has been unresponsive to his 
constituents. He feels that he is 
unpopular with some people 
because of hi$ fiscal conservatism. 
In voting against many of the 
proposals made to the Board, 
Conde believes he is fulfilling his 
campagin promise in 1972 to cut 
back on government bureaucracy 
and regulations. Conde said his 
opposition of the attempt to move 

Role of County 
Supervisors 

The power of the San Diego 
County Board of Supervisors in 
shaping the present and future of 
San Diego is often underestimated 
because of a general lack of 
awareness of the Board's 
responsibilities. The five mem-
bers, listed in order from District 1 
to District 5 are: Jack Walsh, Dick 
Brown, Lou Conde, Jim Bates and 
Lee Taylor. 

UC San Diego falls under Con-
de's jurisdiction as a part of 
District 3. 

Board members are responsible 
for most county wide problems and 
also administer the unincorporated 
areas of the county. They oversee 
and implement the county's 
transportation network, welfare, 
health, solid waste disposal, public 
works, the sheriff's department, 
jail and honor camps. 

Beneath these broad categories 
are included most of the con-
troversial issues confronting the 
public. The supervisors control 
mass transit funds, land fill site 
selection, county job training 
programs, protection of open 
spaces and numerous other issues 
which have aroused public con-
cern. 

Members of the Board are 
elected to four year terms, with 
Districts 1, 2 and 3 up this year, and 
Districts 4 and 5 to be decided on in 
1978. ' 

Lindberg Field, the transfer of 
control of the jail and the building 
of a $21 million rehabilitation 
facility downtown are part of his 
fight to cut down on the size of 
government. 

Bradshaw and Hedgecock feel 
Conde has had a poor record on 
open spaces. Hedgecock says his 
candidacy is a response to Conde's 
anti-environment, anti-service 
record on the Board of Super-
visors. " I got into the race through 
my environmental involvement," 
Hedgecock said. He cited his in-
volvement in the coastal initiative,

Bloc Voting in Julian 

UCSD Student Selected As Carter Delegate 
UC San Diego senior Joe 

Gallagher was among the winners 
in congressional district caucuses 
held last Sunday to select delegates 
to the 1976 Democratic National 
Convention in New York. 

Gallagher, a political science 
major, received the most votes in 
the 43rd Congressional District 
Caucus as a delegate for former 
Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, the 
current frontrunner for the 
nomination. 

SuppOrted by 20 UCSD students 
who ' travelled to the remote 
mountain town of Julian, 
Gallagher was the top vote getter 
among 29 potential delegates. One 
hundred nine Democrats par-
ticipated in the caucus. 

Gallagher's 43 votes were six 
more than the runnerup Carl 
Phaler, a lawyer with the 
California Attorney" General's 
office. Accordl'ng to Roger Cohen, 
media contact for the UCSD Carter 
group and the Joe Gallagher 
campaign, all 20 UCSD students 
voted for the UCSD student. 

According to the Evening 
Tribune, this tactic was used 
elsewhere in the county. In the 41st 
District Carter caucus, over 100 
students and faculty from Point 
Loma College voted as bloc and 
elected four delegates. 

Largest Turnouts 
There was voting for potential 

delegates for all the major 
Democratic candidates in 
California on Sunday. The largest 
turnouts were for Gov. Brown and 
Carter. 

The 41st Congressional District, 
which will send one more delegate 
to the convention than the 42nd and 
43rd Districts, had the largest 
turnouts in San Diego County. At 
the Brown caucus, there were 
more than 300 voters who chose 

Gallagher on the stump in 
Julian. 

~ 

from 59 candidates, while at the 
Carter caucus there were 250 
Democrats selecting delegates 
from a field of 34. 

Response in the other two 
districts was substantially lower, 
though Morris Udall received his 
largest support in the 42nd District, 

delegates, the largest at Madison 
Squ~re Garden. 

Restore Dignity 
Gallagher said that he expects to 

go to the convention if Carter's 
popularity holds up because the 
candidate told his California staff 

Some. of Gallagher's student supporters congratulate him in 
front of Julian tovvn hall after caucus win . 

where he trailed only behind 
Brown in the number of voters. 

Brown attracted th~ lion's share 
of prominent local Democrats to 
his caucuses as delegates. In both 
the 41st and 42nd districts, five of 
the 10 selected delegates are either 
office-holders, candidates or party 
officials. Carter's most prominent 
delegate was Assemblyman Larry 
Kapiloff in the 41st. 

Each delegate list will now be 
trimmed to five in the 41st District 
and four in the 42nd and 43rd 
districts by th candidate's 
steering committee. Mter the 
primary, the delegates allotted to 
each district will be apportioned 
among the candidates according to 
the votes cast in the district. 

Additional delegates will be 
chosen at a statewide convention to 
bring the California total to 280 

that he wants the top vote-getter at 
each caucus to go to New York. 

According to media contact 
Cohen, Gallagher attacked the 
Republican party for " eight years 
of corruption on the top of in-
competence" during his speech at 
Julian Town Hall. 

Gallagher said that he wants to 
go to the convention that will 
"show to the country and to the 
world that here is a man (Carter) 
that can restore dignity to the 
presidency. " 

He concluded by saying to the 
assembled Democrats that " the 
Democratic party can unite behind 
a good and decent man, Jim."l1Y 
Ca rter, and I want to be part of 
historic convention." 

Architect for the 
victory was UCSD "~U.U""I" 
Duke, who managed 
contingent and heads

Candidate Reid Attacks Anti-Busing 
by Nick Vanocur 

StaHWrlter 
In a speech last week at Muir plaza, Socialist 

Worker's Party vice-presidential candidate Willie 
Mae Reid attacke<1 Boston authorities for their 
inaction against anti-busing demonstrators, who 
have made repeated attacks against blacks in the 
Boston Area. 

They're not Cl.ttacklng busing in Boston, they're 
attacking blacks." said Reid. 

Reid cited the picture, which aweared in a San 
Francisco newspaper, of a black youth being 
assaulted by a group of white youths in front of 
Boston City Hall as an example of how bold S01l\e 
whites are becoming in the absence of any action by 
state or local authorities. 

Reid said the firebombing of a NAA P offic was 
another example of unpunished violeoce. 

According to Reid, the Boston Mayor Kevin White 
claims he doesn't have enough fore s to deal with 

such incidents and that Massachusetts 
Dukakis refuses to discuss tl\e probleIl\. 

Reid also said President Ford is leading the anti-
busing movement from the White House. 

The media was also blamed by Reid as well, 
because of its lack of coverage of the e events.

Song and Dance 
Hubert Humphrey is talking. He bubbles with 

energy. He is only 10 minutes late to an hour's break-
fast, which is prompt for him, and he won't begin till 
he has savored the bacon and eggs. He has inunediate 
rapport with the 20 or so reporters at the long table. 

"Yes," he says, "I would accept the call of my 
party." But no, he isn't an active candidate. Ford? 
"The President is a decent guy ... but my uncle Fred is 
a decent guy," he chuckles. "He shouldn't be 
President." There is no malice in him. Jimmy 
Carter? " He has mastered the media, and I admire 
that," he says. He refers toa recent newspaperQ and 
A with Carter: "the best I've seen," he says ap-
preciatively. 

He can no more stop rolling adverbs than a stone 
can stop rolling downhill; the public, he says, is 
weary of primaries-"politically, economically, 
morally, emotionally, eh, eh, physically." There, 
that's five, a typical Hwnphrey burst. 

But he doesn't like the anti-government line some 
candidates are taking-the people who attack 
" Washington." That evokes irritation; it is a code 
word, he says, for opposing things he has worked for: 
aimed at "social programs, the poor, the cities, the 
underdogs," (he hunts for synonyms) "the blacks. 

- , The people who say programs have failed are the 
ones who stabbed them in the back." As he talks he 
builds ire; the attacks on Washington are a 
"disguised form of racism." 

Reporters cock their ears like bird dogs in a field. 
Who's he talking about? Carter has been anti-
Washington; is he calling Jimmy a racist? Dear me, 
no, says Hubert uncomfortably, but that's the way the 
story came out and Jimmy fires back, hot and heavy. 
Humphrey as a candidate, Carter asserts, is too old, 
has a "loser's image," has had unsavory con-
tributions. It is surprisingly heavy-handed. 

So now it's a week later and journalists and guests 
are arriving at the big hotel for the annual Gridiron 
Club dinner that will have its 91st shOwing tonight. 
The men look like black beetles converging in a 
downtown street in tail coats from all directions, on 
foot, at the Statler Hilton. Fifty years ago formal 
attire included top hats, but that ended when FOR 
rode to his Inaugural in an open car with Herbert 
Hoover. Now haberdashers have been renting tail 
coats and wing collars for a fortnight. And guests who 
have spent $25 to hire a suit save a check-room fee by 
walking from their cars to the party without a top 
coat in full regalia, to the edification of a curious 
citizenry already craning for the rumored arriva~ of 
the President. 

The skits are funnier with Jerry Ford right there in 
the big room laughing at himself, and there at the 
headtable, about a block long, is Jimmy Carter. 
Glamor, if there is such a thing in Washington 
politics, suffuses the huge place. 

The Marine Band orchestra plays and a nearly all 
male audience sings. One actor takes the part of 
Hubert Humphrey and goes through an inspired line 
from 01' Man River-" I keep on talking, I keep on 
talking, I don't say nothing, I keep on talking along." 

They love it, Hubert. They are laughing at 
everybody's favorite and they do it with affection. 
There's a song praising "Betty" too, and Mrs. Ford 
unexpectedly comes on stage with a swirling evening 

and does a graceful soft-shoe dance. Now it's 
for the responses to the skits. They are supposed 
whimsical. Carter goes first. 

danger here for a public figure-par-
one reckoned among the godly-for they will 

suspect among the less devout of being 
so it seeme1i in Carter's ferocious attack 

The Gil dlron performers anticipated 

, 

this in a skit: a character representing Jimmy has 
just sung, clothed in robes and with a tinsel halo 
wired to his head. Eyes tum on the former governor. 
It is a test. 

He waits at the lectern and gives an imitation of 
himself, unveiling his dentifrice smile and wheeling 
around left to right like somebody spraying a lawn. 
The timing is good. Everybody laughs. It's funny. 

There follows a string of one-liners, . which a can-
didate can buy ffOm a gagman at so much a yard (or 
compose himself) , and some of them are pretty good. 
Rather gracefully, too, he retreats from that attack 
on Hubert: the Senator had seemed "to old," he says 
in effect, when he attacked racism, but when it 
developed that his targets were Ronald Reagan and 
Jerry Ford, Hwnphrey (Carter explains) suddenly 
seemed a lot younger. A small joke, maybe, but a 
kind of apology too; the audience gratefully 
responds; it seems Jimmy has a sense of hwnor 
buried in there somewhere with all that piety. A 
relief ... 

Nations change leadership variously. Through the 
impenetrable mystery of the Orient, China goes 
through a wall-poster power-struggle to see if deputy 
premier Teng Hsiao-ping succeeds Chou En-Iai. 

In the United States, by processes almost as 
mysterious, we select a president. It takes a year, 
includes 31 primaries and two convention spec-
taculars, appropriate name-calling, and total ex-
penses of around $400 million. (Abe Lincoln spent 75 
cents in his election to Congress.) 

England has just changed 'Prime ministers in a 
chummy procedure that took three weeks. The 317 
members of the Parliamentary Labor Party in the 
Commons, who knew the candidates best, selected 
the one they wanted, something like the plan the 
Founding Fathers had in the Electoral College. In 
Britain, the leadership change may provoke a 
national election before long but that will be mer-
cifully short, too-two months. 

The American campaign has been featured so far 
by the ferocious attacks on foreign and defense 
policies by Ronald Reagan and the consequent 
wavering of President Ford to the right. It seems 
likely now, that Henry Kissinger will be a sacrifice on 
the Reagan altar and, at times, in some of Kissinger's 
pronouncemnts on Angola and Cuba, he gives the 
impression of being rattled. 

President Ford has abandoned the word "detente." 
It is no credit to Ford or the American political 
process that a lightweight like Reagan can be taken 
seriously. The campaign is unsettling America's 
foreign policy at a critical moment, and vote-
catching cries that we are falling behind Russia in 
defense, are scaring the timorous. We 'll be lucky to 
avoid hysteria before it's over.

Bradshaw said Conde, along with 
the other supervisors, has con-
tributed to urbari sprawl in San 
Diego by permitting developers to 
put up housing without requiring 
them to provide facilities for the 
residents. 

Conde denies that he is an ad-
vocate of sprawled growth, which 
he says has been caused by the 
city's restrictive building policies. 
"Because developers can't build in 
the city, there's pressure on the 
housing market in outlying areas," 
Conde said. Conde maintains that 
he has been an advocate of open 
spaces during his term as super-
visor. " I have worked for the 
preservation of the Kemp ranch 
and an Indian reservation in the 
North county," Conde said. 

Mitchell sees community 
planning as the answer to prevent 
"he Iter skelter" growth in San 
Diego. Mitchell calls his position a 
realistic one, balancing the need 
for housing with a need to preserve 
open space. He cites Rancho 
Bernardo as an example of a well 
planned community that provides 
its residents with schools, shopping 
center and other services. 

Mitchell and Burton both said 
that C<lnde hasn't been as fiscally 
conservative on the Board as he 
has claimed to be. Mitchell 
criticized Conde's negative ap-
proach on the Board. "Conde 
doesn't have any new ideas for 
county government. You don't 
have to be against everything to 
save money, you just have to be 
efficient," Mitchell said.
