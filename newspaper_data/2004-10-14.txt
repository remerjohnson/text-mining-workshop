Service workers protest wages 
Union calls for raises in new contract 

RIdIII A. GlldrlGuoIdrJn 
Respect Ralindo Leon (center) participates in an Oct. 13 protest for better 

. wages and working conditions for UC SeMce workers. 

By AMY IFUIUNG 
Contributing Writer 

The American Federation of 
State, County and Municipal 
Employees LocaJ 3299 demonstrat-
ed against low wages of service 
workers employed by the 
University of California at a Price 
Center rally held on Oct. 13. 

"This is about respect," said 
Jessica Lopez, an AFSCME orga-
nizer and 2002 John Muir CoUege 
aJumna. "There is enough money 
to aJlocate to service workers: [the 
university] just doesn't consider 
them important enough to get it." 

The AFSCME rally drew an esti-
mated 100 to 150 supponers for the 
protest, a group comprised of both 
workers and students aJike. Lopez 
introduced a variety of employee 
speabn, who shared their feelings 
of discontent with the university. 

"We want a better saJary, a bet-
ter schedule," said Susana Jaimez, a 
custodian for the Earl Warren 
College residence halls and apart-
ments. "We don't want to have to 
work on SundayS." 

Upon leaving Price Center, pro-
testers marched down Library Walk 
to the office of ChanceUor Marye 
Anne Fox, where Lopez delivered a 
signed letter from AFSCME urging 
the university to provide a "fair raise" 
for service workers. 

In a press release, AFSCME 
stated that its three main objectives 
include "a fair raise over three 
years, a career ladder program [and]

A.S. shelves instant runoff funds 
Vote may delay election program until 2007 

By PATRICK AWN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Reversing the decision of its 
predecessor, the A.S. Council 
voted on Oct. 6 to indefinitely 
table legislation that would have 
provided more than $15,000 for 
the implementation of an instant 
runoff voting system in student 
elections. 

In March 2004, lut year's 

council approved the same alloca-
tion without opposition by a vote 
of20-O-1. 

However, according to A.S. 
PresidentJenn Pae, the Associated 
Students accounts were automati-
caDy cleared at the end of the 
school year before the money had 
been dispersed. Without dispersal, 
the aUocation was canceled and 
the money rolled over into the 
budget for the current year.

Once the accounts were

resubmitted for approval by the 
current council. Rather than 
affirm the action of their prede-
cessors, senators voted to indefi-
nitely put off the legislation by a 
vote of 17-0-1. 

The vote to table the legislation 
was made despite objection from 
Pae, who told the council she did 
not want the system to be forgot-

worked to implement the program. 

The allocation would have

University extends 
co-op lease deadline 

By USAMAK 
Associate News Editor 

Although the campus co-ops wiU 
not be forced to leave their leased 
spaces on Oct. 15, negotiations for 
new lease and operating agreements 
between the university and the co-
ops still remain WU'esolved in the 
midst of new developments. 

Associated Students, the 
Graduate Student Association and 
University Centers originaJly had 
until Oct. 15 to agree on new docu-
ments to replace the Master Space 
Agreement and the Memorandum 
of Understanding, which govern 
the way the co-ops rent their 
spaces. The university had threat-
ened to evict the co-ops from their 
spaces if an agreement was not 
reached by the deadline. 

In the first week in October, the 
-university extended the termination 
deadline to Nov. 15 . It also 
announced that, instead of negoti-
ating with the Associated Students 
and the Graduate Student 
Association, it will now deaJ direct-
Iywith the co-ops, which had previ-
ously been excluded from the nego-
tiation process. University Centers 
will continue discussing the issue 

with student government represen-
tatives, University Centers Director 
Gary Ratcliffe said. 

At an Oct. II press conference, 
AS. President Jeon Pae and GSA 
President Kris Kohler expressed dis-
approval of the negotiation process. 

"Our position has always been 
that we would like to have the co-
ops, AS., the GSA and the admin-
istration at a table discussing what 
are appropriate revisions and what 
are inappropriate revisions," Kohler 
said. "The university has reversed 
its position consistently." 

However, according to Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Student Life 
Carmen Vazquez, the university 
decided to change its position after 
receiving a letter from co-ops 
attorney Lottie Cohen, which 
requested that the co-ops be 
involved in the negotiations. 

"It may seem like the university 
is changing its position, but it's 
actually changing in response to the 
dynamic ongoing communications 
from attorneys," Vazquez said. 

The current disagreement stems 
mainly ftom the MOU, which the 
university asserts expired in 1998.

Millions miss out on finandal 
ai4 ACE analysis finds 

Half of all eligible undergraduate college stu-
dents failed to app~ for financial aid, according 
to the American Council on Education. 

Based on the most recent available data 
from the 1999-2000 school year, approximate-
ly 8 million students did not complete the fed-
eral financial aid application needed to qualify 
for aid, the analysis found. 

Of those who did not file. approximately 20 
percent came from low- and moderate-income 
families and half of those would have been like-
ly to receive Pell Grants. the report stated. 

In addition, more than half of those who did 
fi le an aid application did so after important 
deadlines had passed, hurting their chances of 
receiving aid from state agencies and individual 
campuses. 

Two-thirds of community college students 
did not apply for aid, compared to 42 percent 
of students at public universities. At private col-
leges, only 13 percent of eligible students 
fa~ed to fi ll out the form. 

Universities, policy-makers and opinion 
leaders "must redouble [their) efforts to edu-
cate students and their families about this 
process and simplify what increasingly seems 
to be a Byzantine system: ACE President David 
Ward said.

House closes federal 
student loan loophole 

The House of Representatives unanimous~ 
voted on Oct 7 to dose a loophole that critics 
said has allowed student loan companies to 
collect more than a billion dollars in federal 
subsidies over the course of a decade. 

A September article in the New York Times 
first publicized the loophole and led to calls for 
action from members of Congress. 

The bill temporarily eliminates a provision of 
the Higher Education Act that guarantees states 
and nonprofit lending organizations a fixed 9.5-
percent interest rate on student loans. 

With students paying the current low market 
rates on their loans, the govemment has been 
forced to subsidize lending organizations for 
the difference between the market interest rate 
and the guaranteed 9.5-percent level.

THURSDAY. OCTOBER 14.2004 

I. ETCETERA ••• 

Julia Kim/Guardian 

Congress originally removed the 9.5-percent 
rate guarantee in 1993 but allowed lenders to 
keep collecting the higher interest rates on 
money raised prior to that time. Recent mergers 
between nonprofit groups and commercial o~a­
nizations have made the issue a point of cnti-
cism for education groups and politicians. 

The bill provides for the resulting savings to 
be used for increased loan forgivehess for bor-
rowers who go on to teach math, science or spe-
cial education in schools. The current debt-for-
giveness maximum of $5,000 will be raised to 
$17,500.

Acting Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Mfairs David Miller have determined the 
priorities of outreach funding for the 
upcoming year. 

According to Pae, current proposals 
state that the Preuss School will receive a 
$200,000 increase in funding, while the 
Early Academic Outreach Program had its 
funding cut by 20 percent to 30 percent 
and Student Initiated Outreach and 
Recruionent Comarission had its.iunding 
cut from $60,000 to 520,000. . -

Gallery A on the second floor of Price 
Center and the other will be in John Muir 
College. 

Old Business 
ItemB 

The council voted against.a reallocation 
of$7.000 to AS. Progranuning. which would 
have been used to fund the Sun.God festival . 

During discussion, Pae told the council 
that the funding already provided for Sun 
God in the 2003-04 school year totaled 
$160,000. Members of the council said they 
recognized the imporunc:e of the festival 
but were hesitant to allocate the m9ney so 
early in the school yea,r. 

Vice President of Finance Kevin Hanson 
said that if Sun God needed additional fund-
ing in the spring, he would choose to fund it 
at that time. . 

ItemH 
After discussion, the council decided to 

allocate 52,800 to Marshallpalooza for the 
event on Nov. 19. This number is lower 
than the $4,500 requested by the event 
organizers. The legislation was approved by 
a vote of 11-5-2.

The council voted to allocate $30,296.97 

of previously unallocated funds to

would only affect a small portion of 
students. 

Only 18 percent of UCSD 
undergraduate students participate 
in the elections, according to 
Thurgood Marshall College 
Senior Senator Kate Maull. 

"Given the budgetary con-
straints, we couldn't, in good con-
science, allocate $15,000 for some-
thing that would affect only 18 per-
cent of the students for a week," 
Maull said. 

Without the allocation, the 
development of an instant runoff 
voting system will be left to the 
university-run StudentLink, 
according to Pae. Without the 
funding, Pae and Maull said the 
university estimates the system will 
be completed "as early as 2007." 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Admissions and Enrollment 
Services Mae Brown. who serves 
on the new TritonLink executive 
council, said that the development 
of an instant runoff voting system 
was not included in the list of pri-
orities for the Web sile because of 
the $15.000 allocation made by the 
2003-04 A.S. Council. 

According to Brown. a lot of 
time and energy is being devoted 
to the development of TritonLinlc, 
which will replace the existing 
StudentLink. 

The instant runoff voting sys-
tem would allow UCSD voters to 
choose their top three choices for 
any AS. position. If any candidate 
received a majority of first-choice 
votes. that candidate would be 
declared the winner. If no majority 
emted, the candidate receiving the 
least first-choice votes would be 
eliminated. Voters who ranked the 
eliminated candidate first would 
have their votes transferred to their 

second choice. This process would 
be repeated until one candidate 
received a majority of votes. 

With the system unavailable for 
the immediate future, the A.S. 
Council will have to revise the A.S. 
Election Bylaws, which require 
instant runoffs if no candidate has a 
majority. 

For two races in the 2004 elec-
tion, the council solved the prob-
lem by temporarily changing the 
bylaws to require a rapid runoff 
instead of an instant runoff. While 
an instant runoff has voters rank 
their top choices and uses comput-
ers to perform a runoff automati-
cally if necessary. a rapid runoff 
consists of a second election held in 
the days immediately following the 
general election. 

Because this fix was only tem-
poraey. the council will now have 
to find a more permanent solution. 
Such a solution could include the 
implementation of rapid runoff or 
changes to election bylaws to rein-
state a plurality system, in which 
candidates would not need a 
majority to win. 

While the council did not allo-
cate the money for the instant runoff 
voting system, it has not determined 
the fate of the system. According to 
Marshall]unior Senator Kate PilIon, 
the current council has not made 
any decision yet about whether it 
wants to implement instant runoff 
voting at some point in the near 
future. 

"When used appropriately -
once it's foolproof - I think 
[instant runoff] is the best system," 
Pae said. "We have great develop-
ers on campus, and a program 
should be d~eloped for UCSD."

Huerta deserves spot 
on Board of Regents 

I t would be wise for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
to heed the ue 

Srudents Association's advice 
and appoint Dolores Huerta 
to the UC Board of Regents. 
Doing so would not only 
add a unique voice to a 
board donunated by busi-
nessmen and political 
appointees, but also bener 
serve the people of 
California. 

As a former labor activist 
who worked with Cesar 
Chavez to organize farm 
workers, Huerta clearly 
embodies the ideals of the 
sta te as well as the ideals on 
which the University of 
California was built. During 
her six-month tenure on the 
board last year, Huerta 
demonstrated keen under-
standing of the issues and 
showed concern for key sru-
dent crises like rising 
tuition fees and growing eli-
gibility standards. 

Huerta's appointment 
would also represent a 

much-needed break from ~ 
the current tradition of 
awarding the coveted regent 
positions to large campaign 
(fonors, a practice used by 
both Schwarzenegger and 
his predecessors. PUblic uni-
versities deserve the most 
qualified leadership, not the 
most political, ana Huerta 
certairily fits the bill. 

As the recent attendance 
controversy involving 
Regent Haim Saban has 
shown, the current system 
of making the appointments 
is in dire need of an over-
haul . Instead of using the 
regent position as political 
booty, governors must work 
[0 make their appointments 
more public and take into 
account feedback from con-
cerned groups. The legisla-
ture must also lead in setting 
firm attendance require-
ments that hold uncommit-
ted regents accountable. 

Certainly, appointing 
Huerta would be a welcome 
step in these directions. 

Cityshuttle should 
return to later schedule 
A s college students in our prime, it's 

unusual for us to 
sleep before the wee hours 
of the morning; conse-
quendy, many of the sru-
dent activities and (lerfor-
mances - from Fall Fest to 
concerts in Mandeville 
Auditorium - happen at 
night, beginning as late as 8 
p.m. and often ending close 
to midnight. 

Unfortunately, since the 
beginning of this year, the 
school-operated 
Cityshuttle, which com-
mutes from Mandeville 
Auditorium to University 
Towne Center, has only run 
until 11 p.m., an hour earli-
er than in previous years. 
Because the change in 
schedule was not adequate-
ly advertised, many stu-
dents hoping to catch the 
shuttle after -Fall Fest were 
stranded and forced to 
arrange for alternative 
transportation at the last 
minute. 

For the many students 
who live in the university 
or UTe area, the schedule 
change spells bad news and 
could lead to either fewer 
srudents attending late-
night on-campus activities 
or more srudents driving 
their cars to campus, which 
would further exacerbate 
the campus' parking prob-
lem. 

If nothing else, UCSD 
TransportatIOn and 
Parking Services should 
work more closely with 
the A.S. Programming 
office and the University 
Events office to extend the 
shuttle schedule when 
large events - such as Fall 
Fest - are taking place on 
campus, so that students 
have a convenient public 
transportation o~tion. 
Such a move woul(f not 
only encourage students to 
attend but arso free park-
ing spaces for students 
who live on campus and 
reduce traffic.

Killing IRV funding short--sighted, 
politically influential move 

Iy DANIEL WRTS 
Senior Staff Writer 

In 1992, President Bill Clinton took office with 
only 43 percent of the popular vote. Independent 
candidate' Ross Perot took the heat for drawing votes 
froni his opponent, President George H. W. Bush. 

In 2000, President George W. Bush failed to cap-
ture the popular vote and won only a narrow plural-
ity in Florida. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader 
was blamed by many for splitting the vote and giftng 
Bush the White House. 

In 2002, Jenn Brown was elected UCSD's A.S. 
president. Her vote total was far less than that of her 
other four opponents combined. Campus political 
pundits argued that independent candidates and a 
smaller third party, New Wave, siphoned votes &om 
Brown's main opposition, a slate of candidates called 
Action. As a result, Brown's Students First! ~late 
swept the elections, III1nni:1g nearly every sea ~ for 
which it fielded a candidate. 

Fortunately, the subsequent A.S. Council hali the 
foresight to realize the problems inherent w:th a 
voting system that aUowed candidates to get elected 
with only marginal suppon. The council commis-
sioned a task force to analyze the problem. 
Comprised of representatives &om each college 
council, with input and consent &om the College · 
Republicans, College Democrats and Campus 
Greens, the task force proposed a new, fairer elec-
toral system: instant runoff voting. 

The A.S. Counc~' assed the proposal over-
whelmingly and met nominal opposition when 
the prospect of funding e system arose last quarter. 

Alu, the council's resolve faltered in the face of 
its own financial missteps and desire to maintain the 
status quo. 

Having failed to anticipate this year's budpt 
shortage, the council now finds itsei( needinJ to cut 
student programs already suffering &om insUfficient 
funds. Although the counciJ had alrady approved a 
one-time expenditure from ia raerve 8CCOUiIt lilt 

year, it has suddenly developed a sense of misguided 
fiscal accountability and reversed course, cutting the 
money instant runoff voting needs to survive. 

Politics plays more than a passing role'in the deci-
sion to continue undemocratic elections, Although . 
the recent decision to table the legislation indefinite-
lywas unopposed, Students First!, the political pany 
that ttaditionally has served a narrow - but loyal -
campus constituency of srudent organizations, stands 
to gain the most &om continuing the current system. . 

Predictably, some opposition to instant runoff 
voting has come from Students First!-affifiated 
council members, like Revelle College senior senator 
Ted McCombs. Some question the amount of 
research that has gone into applying this voting sys-
tem to A.S. elections at UCSD. 

Yet, the !ask force met for an entire quarter, sur-
veyed hundreds of students, conferred with most col-
lege councils, consulted voting experts at UC Davis 
and the nonprofit Center for Voting Rights and 
Democracy, and chose instant runoff out of 10 possible 
methods or voting. Most (57 percent) UCSD students 
surveyed preferred instant runoff out of the voting sys-
tems presented. Eighty-one percent felt it represented 
them well, compared to only 38 percent for the current 
plurality system. After a one-minute explanation, 93 
percent of the studena .mdentood the concept. 

lNtant rwaoff voting has the suppon of the sru-
dents and the previous A.S. Council. But instead of 
protecting the integrity of UCSD elections, this 
council has spent itself into I deficit. When the coun-
cil allocates nearly S40,OOO to pay its own salaries, it 
cannot take the moral hish ground md cry -fiscal 
responsibility!- when ldIling I project that costs less 
than half that much to make our e1ecQOIlI fair. 

The councillhould miait this iuue and allocate 
the money &om re.erva before it is too late, lest 
UCSD find itJelf faced with another cosdy runoff 
election or, eftll wane, • council elected by a 
minority.

I don't need no sisterhood 
indecent 
exposure 
Marianne Madden 

Congratulations! You've sur-vived the onslaught of fly-ers, posters and emotional-
ly crippling rejection that Rush 
Week represents. A few brave 
souls have taken advantage of the 
week and rushed sororities and 
fraternities, and the rest of us have 
rushed out of the way, lest the 
Chosen Ones insult our chintzy-
ass jeans to our face. 

Rush Week on Library Walk is 
like middle school all over again. 
Nearly buckling under the weight 
of my backpack, I scurried past 
groups of the so-called "beautiful 
people" in the midst of welcoming 
more well-formed bodies into their 
fold. I could only wonder what it's 
like to be a Chosen One, and why, 
eDcdy, I VJtmteJ to be a Chosen 
One (besides the whole "being cho-
sen" thing). 

Many times last week I walked 
past Library Walk to be visually 
accosted by a huge sign advertis-
ing an "Asian-Interest Sorority." 
But as I examined the girls 
milling around their recruitment 
table in the most fashionable, 
aloof way possible, it seemed like 
membership in this sorority did-
n't promote tn interest in Asian 
culture as much as promote an 
interest in being an unnaturally 
skinny Asian girl and having an 
inner circle made up entirely of 

other unnaturally skinny Asian 
girls. 

Hey, don't knock it - it's not 
insularity, it's "sisterhood." 

But what an odd use of the term 
"sisterhood" it is. I have a sister 
already, but I don't have to pay 
quarterly dues to keep her, and I 
have a bit more in common with 
her than an eating disorder and a 
few randomly chosen Greek letters. 
Do I need mqrr sisters' Honestly, 
having one person to steal my 
clothes is enough. 

I suppose it's part of their 
charm and appeal, bl,lt Greek 
organizations are as odd as the 
girls they deny membership. 
Paying dues to keep your &iends? 
No thanks - I prefer to buy 
friends by bringing kick-ass 
brownies to parties. Wearing the 
sorority'S official colors? No 
thanks - Bile Yellow and 
Gonorrhea Green really don't suit 
me. Suffering through all sorts of 
secret rituals and rites of passage? 
No thanks - I'm already 
Catholic. 

See? You might as well just go to 
Mus, throw some money in the 
collection plate, and dress accord-
ing to a set of strict specifications 
- and Jesus is included in the deal, 
free of charge! 

Considering they're just glori-
fied cliques, sororities and frater-
nities have an incredible mytholo-
gy and weight in our culture. It's 
ofren pointed out that most of the 
men in charge of our country 
belonged to a &at while in college 
- including our current presi-
de.nt, whose oppone~ts often deri-
sively call him the "drunken frat 
boy." 

Social scientists continually 
release studies saying that frater-
nities demand an extreme version 
of masculinity, strict heterosexu-
ality, the subjugation of women 
and probably devil worship as 
well as an excessive emphasis on 
paddling. Journalists jump at the 
chance to pen exposes on Greek 
organi:r.ations, unearthing the 
shoclcing discovery that sorority 
girls go to parties, drink alcohol 
and then have sex, going on to 
commit such crimes as cheating 
by lIsing their sorority sisters' 
copies of old exams, eating a 
high-carb lunch and wearing 
sweatpants on a Sunday after-
noon. 

Before every Greek on campus 
writes angry e-mails to me, I'd 
just like to point out a few things. 
First, this is a humor column, and 
writing about the awesomeness of 
Greek organizations would be sad, 
not amusing. Plus, that would ~ 
an excessively short column, and I 
need to meet a certain word 
count . . 

Secondly, all I'm trying to say 
is that Greek organizations are 
enigmatic: If you're not part of 
one, you just don't get it. In that 
respect, being a sorori ty sister or 
frat brother is like being a moth-
er: After giving birth you rave 
about how it brought wonder and 
joy to your life, but everyone else 
is horrified that you're actually 
bllpp, you let some ten-pound 
tumor claw its way out of your 
vagina. 

That's all I'm trying to say.

Lease: Co .. op attorney files 
grievance against university 

continllld from page I 
Pae and Kohler argued that 
Associated Students and the 
Graduate Student Association have 
the legal right to approve two-year 
renewals of the document, and that 
the university itself approved and 
signed renewals in 2000 and 2002. 

However, Ratcliffe said that the 
University Centers Advisory Board 
must approve renewals passed by 
the student governments. Since 
UCAB was negotiating for amend-
ments to the Master Space 
Agreement and the MOU last 
spring .. it did not approve the 2004 
renewal of the documents, he said. 
The co-op spaces were then leased 
on a month-ta-month basis. 

Cohen and the co-ops have con-
tested that the MOU is supposed to 
last "in perpetuity," which is against 
the UC Board of Regents' poli(.'Y of 
a IO-year time limit for all university 
agreements, according to Vazquez. 

Pae and Kohler have denied that 
any references to perpetual agree-
ments were ever made. 

"There are obviously some con-
flicts as far as the interpretations of 
these documents," Pae said. "There 
haven't been good-faith negotia-
tions. We haven't negotiated at all." 

In an official grievance sent to 
administrators, Cohen and the co-
ops accused the uni versi ty 0 f 
"wrongful denial of due process" and 
obstructing the renewal of the 
Master Space Agreement and MOU. 

Another point of contention 
arose when the student govern-
ments decided to seek legal counsel 
for the situation. According to uni-
versity protocol, all individuals and 
groups need to provide a written 
justification for seeking outside 
legal counsel, and permission to do 
so must be given by Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs. 

Since that department has consis-
tently been on the side of the univer-
sity, such a procedure creates a con-
flict of interest, Pae said. The A.S . 
and GSA representatives have been 
told that they cannot use funds from 
student government accounts for 
legal counsel. 

Pae and Kohler also said that the 
threat of termination of the co-ops' 
lease agreements creates an unfavor-
able negotiating atmosphere. 

"These are not negotiations 
between equal parmers, but rather 
chauvinistic threats by a vice chan-
cellor [of srudent affairs) who is 

clearly out of step with students.» 
Kohler said. "[Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph w.) Watson 
is perpetuating the inefficient and 
hostile relationship with students 
by repeatedly threatening srudent-
run businesses and the elected stu-
dent governments." 

The university administration 
and co-ops have a standing history 
of conflict. In 1992, the university 
shut down Grooodwork Books over 
winter break. On Jan. 15 of that 
year, campus police and administra-
tors broke into the General Store 
Co-op to change the locks and 
search for financial records that the 
co-ops had been ordered to release. 
A superior coun judge approved a 
restraining order on Jan. 16 against 
the administration and the regents. 

"There's a long history of 
aggression of the university against 
the co-ops, and we're much 
stronger with the A.S. and the GSA. 
and therefore a much bigger 
threat," said Erik Borowitt, a mem-
ber of CM Cafe. 

According to Steven Dubb. for-
mer GSA vice president external and 
a 1996 UCSD graduate, the MOU 
was negotiated and went into effect 
in 1993 as a way to resolve the con-
flicting relationships between the 
wliversity and the co-ops. 

"There was a lot of distrust 
between the parties," Dubb said. 
"The MOU was a document that 
nobody really liked. but they could 
live with it. The A.S. and GSA were 
set as intermediaries between the 
co-ops and the university." 

The ooiversity would like new 
documents that would hold the co-
ops accountable for safety and 
health regulations and good busi-
ness practices, Ratcliffe said. In fall 
2003, the Che Cafe staff made 
unauthorized alterations to the 
property and performed electrical 
work without licensed electricians. 

A financial audi t from the sum-
mer of 2003 also suggested that the 
co-ops' financial reports needed 
accountability, according to Vazquez. 

"You may hear from the co-ops 
that we're compromising their 
autonomy," Ratcliffe said . "But 
we're not trying to set a double 
standard by being stricter wi th the 
co-ops than with other business 
enterprises on campus."

Sudan: u.s. government has 
urged international action 

continllld from page I 
itary. the Janjaweed militia and 
other northern paramilitary groups 
have attacked and destroyed over 
400 villages in the region, accord-
ing to Catholic Relief Services 

. Western Regional Director Jim 
DeHarpporte. 

"It's the same story," said 
DeHarpporte. "Villages being sur-
rounded by the Janjaweed in some 
kind of death trap, then an attack, 
burning, pillaging and .raping." 

Survivors of the · attacks are 
forced to travel across the nesert to 
seek shelter at camps in the neigh-
boring COootry of Chad, he said. 

"One woman spent four to five 
days hiding at ' day, traveling at 
night to get to safety," 
DeHapporte said. "She decided to 
go back and see what happened to 
her village ... all her loved ones. 
One hoodred and twenty people 
total had been shot and killed." 

The United States has declared 
the crisis a genocide, and has called 
for action by the UN Security 
Cooocii. 

Several panel members encour-
aged more rapid action. 

"The [international) conununity 
has a mandate to protect lives," said 
BoI Bulabek, I refugee from South 

Sudan and executive director of the 
Sudanese Commurtity of San Diego. 
"We don't need to wait any longer." 

DeHarpporte focused on the 
security situation in the country as 
an ongoing problem . 

"Security is the number one 
issue," said DeHarpporte. "There 
are lots of gaps with the humani-
tarian aide: water, shelter and food. 
But security is still what is most 
important. We are morally and 
legally required to take actiQn." 

One panelist was more skeptical 
of the long-term benefits of third-
party intervention howeVer. 

fAA third party cannot solve 
another's issues," said Abdul Adid. 
"The solution in peace should be 
corning from home." 

The African Union currently has 
a plan to send 1,000 peacekeeping 

_ troops to the region, but lacks prop-
er logistical support, DeHarpporte 
said. The United States has said it 
will not send any aircraft to aid the 
multinational force. 

The panelists encoung~d lis-
teners to contact their representa-
tives and press for greater action in 
Sudan.

Protest University blames state 
budget crisis for stagnant wages 

continued from page J 
a 'step' pay system that respects 
years of experience." 

The university attributes the 
low wages to budget cuts, but states 
that it is taking several actions to 
help remedy the situation. The 
state budget for the current year 
did not provide money for pay rais-
es and did not fund cost-of-living 
salary adjustments. 

"Our new budget compact with 
the governor includes funding 
increases for staff salaries begin-
ning next year, which, if supponed 
by the legislature, will allow us to 
resume regular raises," UC 
spokesman Paul Schwartz stated in 
a press release. 

While waiting for the legislature, 
however, the university is also trying 
to find other ways to recognize its 
employees, including, "a salary-
based approach for premiums so that 
lower-paid staff pay less [for health 
care], retirement income enhance-
ments and twO additional paid days 
off this year,» Schwartz said. 

Though the state budget does 
not provide funding for cost-of-liv-
ing salary adjustments, the union 
said the university has found money 
to provide raises for other workers. 

Under a contract signed last 
summer, 10,000 UC-employed 
patient-care workers - also orga-
nized by AFSCME - were offered 
10 percent in wage increases over 
three years. Service workers were 
looking for something similar, 
Lopez said, but have· not been 
offered pay raises 'during ongoing 
contract negotiations. 

AFSCME represents food 
serwrs, custodians and building 
""intallnce workers, who manage 
IDIDI « the uaiYersity's operations. 

, "We're tryinc to rise to a stan-
dard of tmn, that's comfortable. 
We're not..an, for anything we 
don't deserve, we're asking for our 
fair share," said Bob Hardrick, a 
senior buildilll maintenance 
worker It UCSD who also serves 
on the executive board of 

/NASSDCWIDIIMmt 
AMERICAN EAGLE 

OUTFITTERS 

AFSCME. 
Hardrick acts IS a liaison for the 

bargaining conunittee, which is cur-
rently in waae negotiations with the 
university. The bargaining conunit-
tee is attending to this systemwide 
process by holding meetings at each 
UC campus and the office of UC 
President Robert C. Dynes. 
Meetings It UCSD will begin Nov. 4. 

Individual campuses, however, 
are not r.esponsible for negotiating 
directly with AFSCME. 

"The iuues AFSCME have 
raised, including wages, are. being 
discussed by the parties at the sys-
tem-wide negotiations table," 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Human Resources Rogers Davis 
stated in a press release. "That 
process must be respected and 
appropriately maintained." 

A number of students also helped 
the cause, including members of 
Students for Economic Justice, 
which sponsored the protest. 

"I see Patty, the custodian who 
works on my floor, all the time. 
She's continually cleaning our mess-
es, and she's barely getting anything 
for it," Eleanor Roosevelt College 
freshman Takashi Matsu said. 

The average service worker 
earns approximately $10 an hour, 
below the $12.27 needed by a fam-
ily of four with two working par-
ents to afford basic amenities, 
according to Lopez. 

Among the lowest paid of work-
ers are those in food service, who 
earn $8.32 an hour. Because the 
protest was held during lunch time, 
many of these service workers we.re 
not able to attend. 

"[The university] continually 
tell Is) us there's no money, yet we 
know that they have it," Hardrick 
said. "If the administrators are 
going to receive increases, the peo-
ple on the Boor - the ones who do 
the dirty work - deserve the 
same."

In their new multimillion-dollar puppet show, Mart Srone and Trey Parker avoid focusing on the over satirized political 
arena, instead making fun of as many things as 
they can in a two-hour time frame. As you 
would expect from the creators of "South 
ParK," "Team America: World Police" is vul-
gar, violent and full of sex, all done entirely 
wi th puppets. Surprisingly, the puppets are 
quire impressive, as are the many beautiful sets 
that were created only to be desrroyed during 
the course of the movie. More surprising is 
that puppet violence never really gets old. 

Team America is an elite squad of patriotic 
soldiers willing ro obliterate anything that 
stands in the way of freedom. After discover-
ing that North Korean leader KimJong II has 
been selling weapons of mass deslrUction to 
the highest bidder in hopes of ruling the 
world, the team decides that they need an 
actor that will be able to work his way into the 
most secure locations. They hire a Broadway 
star named Gary. The rest of the plot is very 
thin, which doesn't really matter because this 
film is all about Parker and Stone putting the 
puppets in the craziest siruations imaginable, 
including a graphic puppet sex scene, exces-
sive vomiting, KimJong II singing a Broadway 
style ballad of loneliness and a speech 
President George W Bush should consider 
using before the election. 

Both Parker and Stone are professed 
Libertarians, but they seem to hide their polit-
ical views in this movie. They do, however,

have definite opinions about show business. 
With its excessive explosions, cheesy dialogue 
and sometimes absent plot line, "Team 
America" mocks the action/disaster genre per-
fectly. It also finds time to make fun of the 
self-absorbed political activist actors that we 
see so much of today. Many celebrities are fea-
tured in puppet form, as the Film Actors 

Guild (you can come up with the acronym on 
your own), which led by Alec Baldwin, tries to 
stop the violence of Team America. The cre-
ators' efforts seem to be working, as Sean 
Penn is already speaking out against the 
movie. If you are tired of the parade of 
Hollywood leftists that only seems to increase 

~th time, this movie is perfect for you.

The style of the film will look familiar to 
many as it is inspired by the classic '60s 
English television show "Thunder birds," 
which most people have stumbled across at 
some point. This film uses very few special 
effects, which is an amazing achievement. 
There is always something happening, and 
most of the time itll crude. If "South Park" 
offends you, this movie will most certainly 
do the same. While Parker and Stone fre-
quently play on the film's limitations (they 
purposely choose not to erase the strings), 
most scenes are played out to their full pup-
pet potential. The second half drags on a bit, 
but for the most part "Team America" will 
entertain audiences, especially "South Park" 
freaks. This film is nor for everyone, but if 
you go in expecting an experiment in inde-
cency by two minds that have been stretch-
ing boundaries for a while, you will laugh 
through the whole thing.

The Emerson String Quartet, which ranks among the best chamber music ensembles of the world, will perform 
at Mandeville Auditorium at 8 p.m. on 
Oct. 15 . Renowned for their adept inter-
preta tions of classic and modern pieces, 
as well as their sonically exhilarating 
chemistry, the Emerson String Quartet 
is a' must-see for fans of classical music. 
Formed in 1976, the group is comprised 
of founding members Philip Setzer and 
Eugene Drucker on violins (they alter-
nate first-chair duties), as well as violist 
Lawrence Dutton and cellist David 
Finkel. Each of the members possesses a 
litany of accolades for playing individu-
ally, and together the interplay between 
the genius performers has recently 
earned them the ultra-prestigious 2004 
Avery Fisher prize, awarded for the first 
time ever to a chamber ensemble. They 
have won Grammy awards for their 
Shostakovich, Bartok, Beethoven, Barber 
and Ives recordings, and their recorded 
performances of Bartok's six string quar-
tets are considered by many to be the 
master recorded versions. The quartet 
plays more than a hundred concerts each 
year, including many benefits for global 
issues such as world hunger, AIDS and 
nuclear disarmament. 

The Emerson String Quartet will 
begin this year's ArtPower! chamber sea-
son by breathing new life into Mozart's 
Quartet in G, K. 387, one of six quartets 

that Mozart dedicated to his friend 
Joseph Haydn. Second on the bill is 
Lord Benjamin Britten's Quartet No. 2 
in C Major, Op. 36, a choice that aligns 
with the Emerson String Quartet's desire 
to popularize 20th-century chamber 
music. The third piece will be 
Mendelssohn's Op. 44, No. 1, a piece 
that Mendelssohn cherished for its "pas-
sion." In an effort to foment cultural 
education in UCSD students, there is a 
half-price discount to all UCSD students 
for ArtPower!-sponsored events. That 
means $13 to students, an incredible deal 
for a group of the Emerson String 
Quartet's renown. 

The particular instruments that the 
Emerson String Quartet play are as leg-
endary as the players themselves. Nicolas 
Lupot, who was considered to be one of 
the best French luthiers, crafted Setzer's 
violin in 1793-era Orleans, France. 
Dutton plays a : 796 Milanese 
Mantegazza, and Drucker uses a 1686 
Stradivari (Yes, tht Stradivari). These 
instruments are the musical equivalent of 
a classic Ferrari 250 GTO: rare, priceless 
and the finest vessels in which technical 
skill can be transformed into beautifullrt. 

So go out to a fancy dinner in LaJolla 
(try to hit it during happy hour, manyout-
of·price restaurants can be had cheaply) 
with that girVguy you met at Fall Fest, 
and show them that you have a little bit of 
class by taking them out ro a night of 
world-famous chamber music (interested, 
ladies?). It beats watching "Joan of 
Arcadia."

album reviews 

Ten years after their explosion into the main-stream, Green Day have 
released a controversial rock 
opera - the daring Amn-iam 
Idiot. 

Reminiscent of the Wholl 
Tummy, this is a concept 
album in which the band nar-
rates a story through a roller 
coaster of fast punk, enigmat-
ic mdodies, slow tempos and 
seemingly innate acoustic bal-
lads. 

For better or for worse, 
Green Day is no longer a 

punic bend. The aio taka a 
tum for ezperiment2tion and 
creativity on this latest 
release. Though the album 
includes such nostalgic 
sounding tracks as . "St. 
Jimmy," the album as a whole 
is too melodic and even 
serene at times to be labeled a 
punic record. Overall though, 
it works. 

Despite seeming to be a bit 
lengthy and drawn out, the 
record possesses a very strong 
backbone. It is filled with such 
notable songs as the political.ly

In 2002, Long Island's emo-scenesters Taking Back Sunday released 
their brisk debut Tell All Your 
Frimds, toured fervendy and 
garnered a loyal fan base. 
Then two members quit the 
band and TBS's future 
seemed uncertain. With the 
addition of guitarist/vocalist 
Fred Mascherino and bassist 
Matt Rubano, the group is 
not only back. but its new 
LP Whert You Wat to Bt is a 
high-strung collection of 
songs that will have you vig-

*** 
orously belting out angst-
ridden lyrics while swaying 
in the mash pit. 

TBS uses their tried for-
mula of energetic t2p-a-thons 
with dual vocals md rhythmic 
guitar books. Yet, both musi-
catly md lyrically, the band 
has matured from wails about 
romance gone a~ to more 
refined compositions explor-
ing the vagaries of growing 
up. 

"Set Phasers to Srun" 
forcefully starts off the album 
with a blend of lead singer 

charged track, "Boulevard of 
Broken Dreams," "Holiday" 
and the nine-minute symph0-
ny "Jesus of Suburbia," which 
contains Beach Boys-influ-
enced chorus sections, piano 
solos and BiUie Joe 
Armstrong's still-youthful 
voice eIpRSSing his ever-bleak 
views on the world. 

Green Day throw a 
plethora of ideas on the wall 
with Amtrif6III /JWt, but most 
stick quite pleasingly. If you 
pick up the album in hopes of 
hearing the predictable Green 
Day of a decade ago, YO'I will 
be shockingly disappointed. 
Nevertheless, the band has 
grown up and is talcing strides 
that require more than a 
banging head to appreciate.

even a Beatles cover

from Ltt it Bt) to mix it all 
together under the banner 
of hippie jam music. 

The only detractions 
from this record are the few 
places (especially on the last 
live track, "Betterman") 
where the jamming element 
draws itself out a bit too far, 
but John Buder's skill on 
the 12-string guitar, accom-
panied by all varieties of 
bouncy bass lines, keep the 
groove moving excellently 
for most of the record. 

Well worth a listen or

'Around the Bend' a charming journey 
Dysfunctional family takes the long route in Roberts' new film 

If MIA DYUWSKA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Jordan Roberts advises aspiring writers to "tell the truth." His directorial debut "Around the 
Bend" is based on his own rela-

tionship with an absentee father. It 
took Roberts 30 drafts to write a 
version of the screenplay that he 
felt "comfomble with," in addi-
tion to being a personal story that 
he felt is "emotionally authentic 
for the characters [he) was writing 
about." 

These characters are fathers 
and sons. Henry Lair, masterfully 
characterized by Michael Caine as 
the rambunctious driving force 
and patriarch of the family, is an 
archaeologist who has a passion 
for digging, yet refuses to be 
buried. Christopher Walken is the 
perfect choice to play Turner, the 
absentee father who suddenly 
turns up after 30 years, and dis-
turbs the benign existence of his 
son Jason Gosh Lucas). 

Mter Turner's arrival, Henry 
plots to reconcile his family by 
sending them off on a trip from 
Los Lunas, N.M., to 
Albuquerque, N.M ., to scatter his 
own and his dog's ashes after they 
are deceased. Coincidentally, 
Henry and his dog die soon after

Henry finishes writing the last set

Jason and Jason's son Zack Oonah

to fulfill Henry's request. 

What happens next is excep-
tional. The journey across the 
Southwest weighs heavily on 
Turner and Jason, and the deeper 
they dig into the past (while trav-
eling in an old Volkswagen appro-
priately named "Dig"), the more 
they discover that they are both 
partially incomplete because of 
their separation. 

The tragic secrets and present

the father and son are portrayed in

light and at times funny. Several

REVIEW 

uneasy sc:enes occur when the 
traveling threesome is forced to 
eat "family" dinners at Kentuclcy 
Fried Chicken establishments -
as is mandated by Henry'S care.ful 
memos - despite the fact that 
Jason hates chicken and that 
Turner is vegetarian. Although the 
setup is humorous, these dinners 
provide a viable, though awkward, 
link within the family. 

The incredible journey is made 
possible by the skilled cast. As 
usual, Walken is enigmatic and 
infuses each moment with just the 
right hint of suppressed guilt, 
regret and compassion. With 
understated purpose, Lucas por-
trays a normal, somewhat uptight 
banlc.er genuinely uncomfortable 
with his circumstances. Bobo acts 
with a natural energy; his charac-
ter Zack forces the fWO ad ults to 
work through their grievances by 
innocently asking the right ques -
tions. 

Expect to be charmed by the 
understated performances, peace-
ful desert landscape, and strong 
true-to-life depiction of the enor-
mous future Impact of past mis-
takes. 

For Roberts, the film is a 
heartfelt endeavor. Despite a small 
budget, lack of time and hard-to-
train dogs, "Around the Bend" 
satisfied its director's desires, and 
will satisfy those of its audience as 
well.

Classic mystery 'Dial M for 
Murder' rings up the right number 

Tales of deceit in Coronado performance 
By •• IAN UIGA 
Senior StaH Writer 

Most mysteries are simple open-and~shut cases: The lights go off, someone ends 
up dead, a detective questions 
everybody, and in the end it was 
Colonel Mustard with the lead 
pipe in the conservatory. Yet "Dial 
M For Murder" takes such usual 
PBS fare and turns it inside out, 
offering a finely crafted mystery 
not about who killed whom, but 
what went wrong with the perfect 
murder. Drawing the audience 
into a tangled web of deceit, the 
remarkably clever script by 
Frederick Knott is clearly one of 
the finest mysteries ever written. 
So well-wri nen, in fact, that it was 
immorralized on film by Alfred 
Hitchcock in 1954, and had a suc-
cessful run . on Broadway. (A 
hacked-up version of the script 

, also formed the basis for the 1998 
Michael Douglas vehicle U A 
Perfect Murder," but you can't 
have everything.) 

Lamb's Players Theatre's 
ensemble does a good job of cap-
turing the mood of such a piece; 
somewhere in between the cheeky 
British accents and the expertly lit 
set, the audience is taken for a 
surprisingly comfortable ride with 
all the flair of a Hitchcock film 
and all of the humor of A&E's 
recent Poi rot productions. 
Director Kerry Meads deserves 
praise for developing every 
nuance of the script without 
resorting to cheap gags or trite 
sentimentality. 

In addition, the acting 

Theater 
REVIEW 
dese~es praise: Rick D. Meads 
headlines the cast with an icv, 
wonderfully subdued portrayal of 
the murderous former tennis star, 
and Nick Cordelione does a nice 
job as a paranoid con arrist forced 
to play the other side. 
Unfortunately, Jennifer Austin's 
perpetually frightened wife plays 
a little too over the tOP to fit the 

. realistic mood of the play, but it's 
hard to tell whether her ho-hum 
performance is the fault of her 
cheesy collection of lines or her 
actual ability. Matt Scott as a pulp 
writer and David Cochran Heath 
as a somewhat bumbling inspec-
tor round ou t the cast wi th solid 
performances. Since the perform-
ers are all part of a reside nt 
ensemble, their chemistry togcth-
er is excellent and nobody hog~ 
the spotlight in a refreshing break 
from most high-end the.ltrc . 

Overall, "Dial M For .\!turder" 
is a fun experience, offering an 
old-fashioned murder mystery 
and requiring the audience to sort 
out a multitllde of mind games as 
the evening progresses. Though8 
It isn't a big Broadway production 
and doesn't take any risks - it 
still manages to capture the old-
fashioned charm missing frOID 
recent drudgefests such as 2001's 
"Gosford Park." Recommended 
for any fans of Hitchcock or tilm

THUP.SDAY, OCTOBER 14. ZOO4 

-Coif takes fifth at Chico, 
extends preseason tear 
Duckworth and Dolby rally to lead . 

Tritons, finishing No. 10 and No. 12 
IfJOlSPANO 
Senior StaIf Writer 

Coming off an impressive 
third place finish at the Western 
Washington Univeristy 
Invitational last month, the 
Thtons found themselves in fifth 
place out of 13 teams at the Chico 
State Wells Fargo Invitational on 
Oct. 11 and Oct. 12, which took 
place at ' Butte Creek Country 

'Club in Chico, Calif. 
The Tritons came out firing 

on all cylinders during the early 
round on Oct. II, putting togeth-
er a team score of 291, their low-
est round of the tournament. 
They came back in the afternoon 
of Oct. 11 and the morning of 
Oct. 12 to shoot successive 
rounds of 298, finishing with a 
23 -over-par 887, good enough for 
fifth place, 

Cal State Bakersfidd came in 
first place overall, putting together 
rounds of 285 and 290, respective-
ly, on Oct, 11 and scoring a 291 on 
Oct. 12 to finish with 866, two over 
par. Hot on Cal State Bakersfidd's 
heels was St. Martin's College, 
which fdl one stroke behind to 
come in second place with a total 
of 867 after shooting rounds of 
290,287 and 290. 

The University of Hawaii-
Hilo rounded out the top three 
with 874, 10.over par, comprising 
rounds of 287,286 and 301. Cal 
State Stanislaus was the final team 
to edge O\lt the Tritons, earning 
fourth place with 877 after rounds 
of 291, 295 and 291. 

UCSD managed to top 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rival Western 
Washington University, which 
had beat the Tritons at the last 
tournament, IS well as Chico 
State, which UCSD had managed 
to outscore in their previous 
engagement as well. 

Individually, senior Brian 
Duckworth cootinued his leader-
ship role on the Triton team, 
coming in first for the third of 
three preseason tournaments. 
Duckworth shot 217, 1 over par, 
which was enough to earn him a 
tie for seventh place. He started 
things off well on the morning of 
Oct. 11 with I 4-under-par 68, 
one of two under-par scores for 
the team. Duckworth returned in 
the afternoon to shoot an even 
par, and then earned a 77 on Oct. 
12. 

Fdlow senior Joe Dolby, the 
other half of the Tritons' skilled 
duo, took second place for UCSD 
and tied for 12th place overall 
with his J-over-par 219. Dolby 
netted a pair of 745 on Oct. 11 
and came back on Oct. 12 to 
shoot the second of two under-
par rounds for the Tritons with a 
71. 

Sophomore Ryo Yamada, who 
has put together some impressive 
preseason play, came in third for 
the Tritons and tied for 25th in 
the tournament. His rounds of 72 
and 75 on Oct. 11 and 78 on Oct, 

. 12 were enough to give him 225, 
9 under par. 

Luke LeveiUee, also a sopho-
more, took fourth for UCSD and 
tied for 3 I st. overall, one stroke 
behind Yamada with 226, 10 over. 
Leveillee shot consecutive 77s on 
Oct. 11 and returned on Oct. 12 

. to earn an even-par 72. 
Senior Jan Godosb completed 

the squad for the Tritons and fin-
ished in 61st place with his 20-
over-par 236. Godoslci rumed in a 
pair of 78s on Oct. 11 and an 80 on 
Oct. 12.

The first match is scheduled Oct.

Soccer: 
Confidence 

guides squad's 
total success 

continued from page ,6 
to the opponents' average of 2.21. 
Lautenschleger and the Triton 
defense continue to be stable, 
allowing only six goals so far this 
season and recording seven 
shutouts. UCSD's offense has 
outscored its opponents 27-6. 

The current success of the 
Tritons has brought more confi-
dence to the whole team, and the 
old and new players are adjusting 
well to each other. 

"I definitely think we've been 
playing well lately," Cochran said. 
"The team is coming together and 
it's easier to play. We play with a lot 
more confidence. "

Chico State on Oct. 15 at RIMAC

3 overall and 5-1-2 in the CCAA.

Water polo can't hold off No.5 Gauchos 
Tritons earn two wins against Long Beach State, lona 

By MAnHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

Freshman dri,ver Adnan 
Jerkovic was the lone Triton scor-
er in the losing effort against No. 
S UC Santa Barbara on Oct. S, as 
the No. 6 Triton men's water polo 
squad dropped its third of four 
contests to the Gauchos this sea-
son. Jerkovic's four goals weren't 
enough, and UCSD sank, 8-4. 
Back in action on Oct. 9, the 
Tritons topped Long Beach State 
in a narrow 9-S contest, and then 
trampled over the Gaels of lona 
College, 12 -6. 

Prior to the Oct. S match, 
expectations were high: UCSD 
was 1-2 against the Gauchos in 
three games, all won by a single 
point. Adding to the difficulty fac-
ing the Tritons was the knowledge 
that UC Santa Barbara had, in the 
previous week, knocked UC 
Irvine from the No.5 spot with an 
upset win at the NorCal 
Tournament in Stockton, Calif. 
This shuffle in the ranJcings meant 
that if the Tritons had been able to 
dispose of the Gauchos, UCSD 
would have advanced to No.5 in 
the weekly Men's National 
Collegiate Top-20 poll. 

Opening the game, Jerkovic 
struck first with a score only 1:38 
into the first period. Most 'of the 
rest of the opening period was 
scoreless until the Gauchos went 
on a 2 -0 drive in the final two 
minutes, ending the first frame 2-
1. 

In the Tritons' strongest scor-
ing quaner of the game, the teams 
tied 2-2 in scoring in the second 
period to end the half, 4-3, in 
favor of the Gauchos. 

The match, though off to a 
close St3rt, dissolved rapidly after 
the half. Jerkovic was the only 
Triton who could get the ball past 
UC Santa Barbara goalie Jon 
Bonafede, and the Tritons tallied 
only one score after the half. 

Junior goalie Colin McElroy 
blocked nine Gaucho shots in the 
contest. 

Two keys to the Gauchos' suc-
cess over UCSD were the near-
flawless performance of Bonafede, 
who, with an ll-save second half, 
prevented 16 scoring chances by 
the Tri!ons, and the consistency 
with which the Gauchos were able 
to score. In terms of scoring, UC 
Santa Barbara was steady, record-
ing two goals every quarter. 

On Oct. 9, UCSD paid a visit 
to the Long Beach Invitational for 
matches against the tournament 
host 4gers and Iona College of 
New York. Long Beach State 
played the Tritons close in the 
first match, leading by two goals 
at two different times in the first 
half. For the entire first half, 
UCSD battled to put the 4gers on 
the defensive. With only 1:53 
remaining in the first half, and the 
score tied after a 2-0 Triton drive, 
junior driver Chris Eichholz 
helped UCSD gain its first advan-
tage of the game with his second 
goal of the match. 

The Tritons outscored the 
4gers in the third quarter by a 2-1 
margin, enough to tie the match 
going into the final seven-minute 
period. Long Beach State scored 
its last goal in the first minute of 
the founh quarter and then was 
silenced by pis &om junior two-
meter man Chris FineJOld.

and J erkovic. 
McElroy blocked 10 shots in 

the victory. Eichholz led Triton 
scoring with three goals, as fresh-
man two-meter Simon Shafer, 
freshman driver Ben Miller and 
Juntor two-meter Matthew 
Budnick each contributed one to 
the effort. 

Later in the afternoon of Oct. 
9, UCSD faced off against Iona. 
After the initial quarter, the score 
might have worried Triton fans as 
the Gaels knotted UCSD at three 
goals each. But doubt vanished 
before the half as lona was com-
pletely shut out in the second 
frame, 3 -0, giving the Tritons a 6-
3 halftime advantage. 

The Tritons never slowed down 
enough for Iona to mount any son 
of comebaclc, as UCSD outscored 
the Gaels 2 -1 in the third period 
and 4-2 in the final quarter, closing 
out the 12-6 thrashing. 

Scoring was well distributed 
across the UCSD bench as seven 
Tritons recorded goals. Eichholz 
again led UCSD with three. fol-
lowed by Casellini, Jerkovic and 
sophomore driver Joe Woodring, 
each with a pair. Rounding out 
UCSD scoring, senior captain 
Nate Cooper, Miller and Finegold 
tallied one each. 

In the cage for the Tritons, 
junior goalies Dave Miller and 
Bryan Corbett came out even, 
each blocking the same number of 
shots as they allowed through. 
Miller stopped four shots over 
three quarters and allowed four 
past. In the final period, Corbett 
prevented two gorJ attempcs and 
sacrificed two scores.

Women's soccer rolls 
over CSU Monterey Bay 
UCSD demonstrates offensive 

prowess in 5 -1 route over Otters 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

Even with the addition of 15 
new players to the No. 16 UCSD 
women's soccer team this season, it 
did not take long for the women to 
develop team chemistry. The 
Tritons have lost only one match, 
and 12 different players have 
scored goals thus far. On Oct. 10, 
UCSD extended its winning streak 
to seven games with a 5-1 romp 
over California Collegiate Athletic 
Association newcomer Cal State 
Monterey Bay in Seaside, Calif. 

"It was a good game," UCSD 
head coach Brian McManus said. 
"The first 20 minutes was tight and 
our girls were fired up. We had a 
couple of breakaways and we 
scored a couple of goals [on the 
breakaways] ... 

Senior midfielder Jadyn Shaffer 
and sophomore midfielder Megan 
Dickey put UCSD ahead in the 
first half, opening up the floodgates 
for the offense. Shaffer's goal was 
unassisted while sophomore for-
ward Kelly Cochran picked up an 
assist on Dickey's goal. 

"[Cal State Monterey Bay] was 
actually not that bad of a team," 
Cochran said. "[However], once we 
finally scored, they backed off'a lot. 
We scored many different kinds of 
ways so that was good." 

In the second half, the Tritons 
continued to exploit the Otters' 
weak defense, scoring three more 
goals. Shaffer recorded her second 
goal of the afternoon with an 
assist from freshman midfielder 
Caitlin Ryan. Dickey also netted 
her second goal of the game while 
junior defender Kristina De La 
Rosa tallied the fifth goal for 
UCSD. 

"We played really well and just 
finished our chances," McManus 
said. 

The Otters finally broke 
through the Tritons' solid defense 
and found the back of the net with 
less than six minutes left in the 
match. Cal State Monterey Bay's 
Danyell Cortopassi put one past 
freshman goalie Meira Dinsmore 
(usually a midfielder), who came in 
late in the match to replace injured 
senior goalie Jamie Lautenschleger. 
However, Cortopassi's goal was the 
only bright spot for the Otters in 
their 10th loss of the season, drop-
ping them to 1-10 overall, O-S in 
the CCAA. ... 

The Tritons outshot the Otters, 
17 -9, and had six comer kicks while 
Cal State Monterey Bay had none. 
Lautenschleger had three saves 
before she left the match, while the 
Otters' Mallory Carroll and 
Valentina Valdez combined for 
three saves and allowed five goals. 
Although Lautenschleger was 
injured by a kick to the hand, 
McManus expects her to stan in 
the Tritons' next match. 

Meanwhile, UCSD improved to 
11-1 overalJ and 7-1 in the CCAA. 
The Tritons sit atop the North 
Division, holding the best record in 
theCCAA. 

Dickey and Cochran both lead 
the Tritons in scoring with 14 
points each; Dickey has six goals 
and two assists while Cochran has 
five goals and four assists. 
Freshman forward Ali Lai has eight 
points, and Shaffer has seven. On 
defense, Lautenschleger has been 
solid in the net for UCSD with a 
.886 save percentage. Her goals-
against average is 0.41, compared
