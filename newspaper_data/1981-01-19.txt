Betty Ford brings 
crusade to UCSD 
F.ormer First Lady attacks 
problem that plagued her 

BY JONATHAN KROLL 
Staff Writer 

Betty Ford, former first 
lady and recovered alcoholic, 
described her struggle with 
alcoholism and drug 
addiction to a full house at 
Mandeville Auditorium 
Saturday. 

''I'm recovering from the 
disease" and now "every-
thing looks better, the 
flowers look brighter and the 
mountains look greener," she 
said. 

publicly while at Long Beach. 
Ford said Saturday that 

she made her addiction public 
so that she might encourage 
others with similar problems 
to seek help. 

"Mrs . Ford displayed 
extraordinary courage and 
gave alcoholism's stigma a 
devastating blow by stating 
that she is addicted to 
alcohol. ... There is no 
question that many of tnese 
people will now seek 
treatment as a result of Mrs. 
Ford's action," said the 
National Council on 
Alcoholism after her public 
disclosure. GlUlrdiIJII /ik pltoto 

Drawing laughter from the 
crowd of BOO, made up largely 
of members of the San Diego 
community, Mrs. Ford said, 
"Alcohol and pills don't make 
things stop hurting, they just 
make things fuzzier." 

Her speech was part of the 
first "Awareness Hour" 
sponsored by The San Diego 
Coalition on Alcohol 
Problems. 

A large part of alcoholism 
is the denial of the problem 
which, Ford said, "is true of 
women to a great extent." 

Betty Ford 

Ford drew national 
attention to the problem of 
alcohol and drug addiction in 
1978 when she sought help at 
the Alcohol and Drug 
Rehabilitation Center at 
Long Beach Naval Hospital. 
She admitted her addiction 

N aney LaSa, former CaI-
PIRG worker, thinks the 
or18nization should reach 
out more to UCSD students, 
who provide it with 
thousands of dollan a year. 

"Noone wants tothinkofa 
mother or a sister or a 
daughter as being alcoholic 
- and of course we thrive on 
that, those of us who are ill, 
because that's our sort of 
escape mechanism," she 
said. 

This denial is due to the 
stigma attached to the 

disease, she added. 
Women in times of pain 

"are more apt than men to see 
a doctor" for help, she said. 
Too often these doctors will 

rrescribe drugs, rather th~n Isten to a woman s 
complaints. Con equently , 
"eighty percent of the women 
today who claim to be 
alcoholics and .are dealing 
with their alcoholism are also 

CalPIRG gets $$$ 
- what about us? 
Consumer action group has 
no programs for UCSD 

BY JOHN BRICE 
Staff Writer 

UCSD tudents donated 
over $25,000 last year to a 
stude.nt organization 
managed by only a few 
students, and in return 
received what critics carped 

was no more than a price 
survey of local liquor stores. 

The organization is 
CalPIRG, part of a nation-
wide network of public 
interest research groups that 
has an understaffed campu . 
outlet which i itself part of a 
four-member San Diego 
combine with a budg t , 
according to it 1979 tax 
return, of over 190,000. 

Over 4,000 UC D tu-
dent , on the average, 
contribute $2 each quarter to 

the organization as part of 
their fees, but the organiza-
tion last y~ did nothing to 
directly oenefit UCSD 
students. 

CaIPIRG·San Diego's 
projects last year included a 
liquor store study (reprinted 
in The Guardian), a $20,000 
pesticide study, a $65,000 
consumer health advocacy 
training project, a consumer 
hotline and a $60,000 
"conservation theater 
troupe" that played the 
campus occasionally last 
year. 

Bruce Lyons, who along 
with Julie Mattern, is the 
entire CalPIRG staff on 
campus, defends the PfRG's 
neglect of student-interest 
services. 

"We are a student 
organization that employs 
student resources to aid in 
the community. Student 
will be aided indirect.ly." 

And Bill Judson , SD 
CalPIRG assistant director, 
say "We offer the student a 
lot - profe sional taff 
experienced in law, legisla-
ture and nousing advocacy, 

alo~~ w,~th work tudy 
positIon. 

Ever one at ' CalprRG 
points Ollt that a campus 
consu mer hotlin will open 
thi quarter. 

Still, former Ca lPIRG 
organi7 rs voice complaints 

addicted to some other drug, 
like a prescription drug." 

Ford emphasized that 
alcoholism is a disease, and 
those suffering from it should 
seek help from friends , 
family or community 
organization such as a local 
church, the San Diego 
Coalition on Alcohol 
Problem or through 
employee pro grams. 

at CalPIRG's failure to 
actively r!cruit student 

involvemenr~ 
"Very few students know 

what CalPIRG is, what it can 
do and what they can do for 
it," says Nancy Laga, a 
former CalPIRG organizer. 
She thinks this is CalPIRG's 
fault. 

"The more visable people 
are gone. Mark Harris, who 
now works at the downtown 
office, u ed to stand down at 
the Registrar's (office) and 
explain what the (CaIPIRG) 
fee and the ~oup were all 
about. There IS no one doing 
that now," says Laga. 

"AI 0, it is hard to get 
money from downtown for 
on-campus advertising," she 
ays. San Diego CalPIRG 

director Dave Durkin feels 
"newspaper add have been 
unsucce sful and flier have 
done little more." 

Responding to complaints 
that PIRG hould put student 
donations to work for the 
student , Durkin say "the 
student donations which 
were over $40,000 last year, 
are used to create a ba e, 
from which we can eek 
further fund ." 

Durkin also belive 
CalPIRG i a sort of tax on 
student to help pay their 
debt to the public for it 
support of the UC system. 

"Citizens pay a lot of the 
co t of higher education; 
thi i a chan e for t he 
student to pay back th 
community," he ays.

Thirty-four months ago 
Ford faced up to her problem 
with the help of her husband, 
children and friends. Now 
she is speaking out to heJp 
others. 

"I think women associate 
with me becau e I have held 
all the roles: I have had a 
career and I'm a grandmother 
now; I've been through all the 
different stages. I guess my 
age helps because no matter 
what age a woman is, she 
knows I've been there," said 
Ford, now 62. 

"I am trying very hard to 
address not only alcoholics, 
but the family of the 
alcoholic, the friends of the 
alcoholic and the public, 
because I do feel that it's 
through education about the 
disease - not just treating it, 
but educating the public -
that we're going to make 
possible the results." 

In the press ronference 
following the two-hour 
seminar, some oft he mail she 
received after her public 
disclosure advised her not to 
publicly air her problem, and 
this initially discouraged her 
from speaking out. 

"Some people felt that I 
shouldn't talk about it in 
public, that it was a personal 
matter. I withdrew some- · 
what in my thinking at first 
but there we.re so many

help and were asking for help 
from me, that I felt it was

Third World unity 
Dlust be sought 
.Editor. 

As I walked around the 
various campuses at UCSD 
receatly, I found it 
frustrating to see that the 
number of Third World 
studeaq is still on the 
decline. in proportion to 
~. to the point of being 
mVlSlbie. The question is: 
who is to blame for this 
unjust and racist atmosphere 
that aeem to penetrate this 
institution 01 IeamiDJ? Is it 
the faulr 01 the admmistra-
lion, fltcuhy, staff, Educa·

or the IICi: of commitment on 
the ..... of everyone at 
UCSD? 

Ilmow for a fact that Third 
World students through 
Student Affirmative Action 
Committee and respective 
or,anizations have tried 

vigorously various strategies 
and methods to combat the 
declinin,- numbers of 
Chicano, Black. American 
Indian, Asian and Filipino 
populations for the past three 
years I've attended UCSD. 
Yet the numbers still decline 
and minimal to no progress 
has been made to correct this 
depJorable situation. 

Yes, meetings after 
meetif1lS have taken place 
with Chancellor Atkinson 
Director of Relations with 
Schools Harold Temmer and 
others in hopes to evaluate 
where the problems stems 
from and find strategies that 
may be possibly utilized. As 
of yet. the quality of 
commitment to our declining 
numbers is still far away 
from reality.

convenient for iOP to 
become the sca~oat of the 
administration (a big set·up), 
thus avoiding any responsibi-
lity for their own actions and 
lack of concrete commitment 
to Third World students . 

The complacent attitudes 
of those in power, with the 
influence to correct and 
implement co r rective 
measures to our cause, I find 
to be in ulting to the 
intelligence of Third World 
students, who have struggled 
with this issue for the past 
three years - both those who 
have left UCSD as well as 
those who are still here. The 
professional whitewash 

FinaUy, we must put in 
check any person who 
supports the present status 
of our Third World races on 
this campus. Just as during 
the 60s and early 70s, Third 
World students are faced 
with the cumbersome task of 
defining, defending and 
developing their causes and 
people. They are doing this to 
make sure that the doors that 
are again being closed to us 
will remain open to those 
who will follow our path, 
thus leaving a legacy of 
struggle and hope to our 
parents, our children and 
ounelves.

accomplished? Four basic 
options are available to us to 
use in any sequence we prefer 
and see necessary. First, we 
must use the institutional 
influence students have 
acquired through hard work 
and struggle - in all the 
committees, college councils 
and student government 
offices we have access to. We 
must constantly and 
continuously press for more 
Third World recruitment and 
expose the system whenever 
we see it being corrupt and 
unworkable. 

Secondly, we must begin to 
devel~p a worki ng and 
c~ordlDated relationship 
WIth our respective com-
m,:,nities, for they are the 
pnmary reason we are here. 
Let us go back to our parents 
and other loved ones for 
support, and advise them on 
how to deal with the racist 
obstacles we find at UCSD. 

Thirdly, wemust build and 
develop alliances with other 
Third World students and 
with coalitions of people who 
sympathize with our 
interests and aspirations. 

Finally, we have at our 
disposal the ability to 
intervene in the system that 
denies us our rights as 
members of the human race. 
This option, though not 
usually practiced, is the most 
effective. It was as a result of 
the 60s and the urban revolts 
which gave that period its 
most dynamic character that 
most Third World students 
are now enjoying the benefits 
of a higher education. 

Disruption as a political 
ploy manifests itself in 
basically two ways: 1) sit ·ins. 
or the occupation of key 
administrative offices; and, 
2) murt suits, planned and 
directed against those who 
would deny us our constitu· 
tional and human rights .

Atkinson suggests 
unified graduati~n 
Would de-emphasize four 
college programs in June 

BY LISA SULLIVAN 
The four college council disagree with Chancellor Richard 

Atkin on's propo al to consolidate separate graduation 
ceremonie into one event. 

They argue that the plan would be both impractical and out 
of line with UCSD's four-college philo ophy. 

In the past, four individual ceremonie have been staggered 
throughout graduation day, allowing each college to stage a 
unique program. Despite the intimacy of small ceremonies, 
former student complained that they had missed grqduating 
with friends from the other colleges. 

Hence. Atkin on pro po ed a common ceremony to erve as 
"an expre ion of unity," according to Assistant Chancellor 
Pat Ledden. The i ue was then brought to the college councils 
for consideration. 

But the proposal has been opposed-at each college. 
"Dehumanizing," is how the Warren Council described it in 

a letter to the (Ohancellor to be sent this week. 
"A centralized graduation is inconsistent with the four-

college philosophy. Each college provides an intimate and 
comfortable atmosphere where students feel they are 
accomplished human beings as opposed to a number," the letter 
added . . 

The Revelle Council express eo a similar sentiment. "We 
highly value the warmth. closeness and personal recognition 
that the ind ividual commencements provide." wrote the 
council. 

Mu ir' s Council examined alternatives to the proposal- such

Assuming a ratio of about five guests to each graduate, they

What do 
we get, 
CaIPIRG? 
continued from page 1 
CalPIRG organizer who was 
in trumental in the cam-
paign for the 1978 student 
referend um vote t hat allowed 
CalPIRG to olicit donations 
in the reg fee pack. ays 
"They (CaIPIRG) don 't want 
to challenge the powers that 
be; the only way to organize is 
to challenge the powers that 
be." 

Lyons counters: "We are 
not a political organization; 
we are a consumer advocate 
group." 

Li Mandri , who built up 
CaIPIRG 's ranks to 25 when 
he was director, says "What 
they are doint then is being 
naive. They are a political 
group. Students voted for it 
because it was political." 

Durkin contends that 
CalPIRG has involved itself 
in consumer affairs that are 
very political. He cited work 
to stop condominium 
conversion and to protect 
nuclear plants, the Sun 
Desert plant in particular. 
"We are geared towards 
things we feel we can 
influence: we feel that we 
would be ineffective on many 
political issues." 

Li Mandri says that this 
approach not only hurts 
CalPIRG in building up a 
volunteer group but it al 0 
causes the group to fail to 
inform the student body. 

"Apat hy is a reflection of 
confusion. What a group like 
CalPIRG should do i bring 
clarity to the issues, expose 
information ," Li Mandri 
says. 

Regardles of the cause, 
lack of student involvement 
is CaIPIRG's main problem 
on the UCSD campus. 

"It i difficult to get 
students involved," says 
Laga. "People, right (rom 
their first day on this 
campus, are told that they 
don't have time. That is not 
true; school is more than 
classes. " 

Judson feels "it is a 
geographic problem. Much of 
CaIPIRG's work is done 
throughou t t he city and most 
students don 't have the 
means to get around." "I 
wish they would pm on more 
programs so students could 
find out what CalPIRG is 
about," Laga says. 

"We would really like to 
have more UCSD student 
involved," Durkin says. The 
student body i an "explosion 
of talent, a brain tru t," he 
says. In an effort to build up 
support, he will begin regular 
weekly visits to this campus.

V.Kennedy 
sees bad 
times near 

UCSD and higher educa· 
tion generally, in California 
is in for a " belt tightening" 
within the next ten years 
according to V. Wayne 
Kennedy, the newly appoint-
ed Director of Planning and 
Budget. 

Kennedy has served as 
national chairman of the 
Association of American 
Medical Colleges' group on 
business affairs and its 
professional development 
committee. 

He is currently a member 
of the UC systemwide 
com m i ttee on research 
management, the national 
committee 'on governmental 
relation board of manage-
ment and a consultant to the 
federal Bureau of Health 
Manpower. 

According to Kennedy, the 
effects of Proposition 13 in 
cutting back tax revenue and 
the eventual depletion of 
surplus funds together with 
probable cutbacks in Federal 
support under the fiscally 
conservative Reagan admini· 
stration and inflation will 
lead to "limited" improve-
ment of the school budget. 

He also cites the present 
tail end of the baby boom 
generation as a demographic 
factor for a tighter school 
budget. 

With a prospective drop in 
student enrollment corre· 
sponding financial resources 
from the Federal, State and 
UC system will be curtailed. 

Betty Ford 
on campus 
continued from page 1 
about it ," she said. 

Responding to a reporter's 
question, Ford did not think 
there was anything wrong 
with campus bars. "I 
wouldn'f think that it would 
be particularly necessary 
within the school property, 
but I'm sure there are plenty 
of them right around t.he 
corner, and if you want a 
drink you'll get it no matter 
where it is," she said. 

Dr. Joseph Cruse, chief of 
staff at the Palm Springs 
Eisenhower Medical Center, 
also spoke during the two-
hour program and praised 
Ford for her help. Because of 
her, "the stigma on 
alcoholism is decreasing and 
consequently people are 

comin~ for treatment 
earlier,' he said. 

Cruse said the public 
"Alcohol Awareness Hours" 
provide a valuable opportu· 
nity "for people to break the 
ice, and get information." 

He said the program 
against alcoholism is "not 
prohibitionist," but tries to 
Inform Americans of 
alcohol's risks. "With full 
knowledge and awareness of 
the risks of using alcohol, we 
feel there would be much less 
of a problem of alcoholism 
and other related problems 
such as auto accidents and 
violent crimes," said Cruse. 

The awareness hour was 
co-sponsored by the UCSD 
School of Medicine and Home 
Federal Savings & Loan of 
San Diego.

Triton cagers lose on 
percentages to Biola 

BY BOB McSPADDEN 
"Will they ever miss?" pleaded UCSD basketball coach John 

Block as he watched Biola College outscore the Tritons 87-69 
Saturday night in the Main Gym. 

It was not an unreasonable hope, as the Biola sharpshooters 
caged 76 percent of their s hots in each half. easily s urpassing 
UCSD's mark of 45 percent. 

The Tri tons played aggressive basketball in the first half 
against the quick Eagle attack, employing a backcourt press 
from early on. The hos ts held to within four points until late in 
the half. Biola then tallied six una nswered points to leave UCSD 
down at intermis8iion , 44-34-. 

TOTAl COST - SAME PRICE TO ALL! 
At Venus. de Milo there are: 
* No hidden costs 

BY STAN HONDA 
Sport. Editor 

Las t week 's ruling by the 
NCAA (National Collegiate 
Athletics Association) to hold 
national championships for 
women at major colleges will 
have little immediate effect 
'on women's sports at UCSD. 

Acting ' Athletic Director 
Andy Skief said recently that 
any decision on whether 
teams will switch to the 
NCAA will be made when 
Director Judy Sweet returns 
from s abbatical. 

Women's teams at UCSD 
currently hold membership 
in both NCAA Division III 
and AlA W (Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics for 
Women) Division III, but 
compete in only AlA W -
s pon s ored post ·season 
events. 

The major difference 
between the two organiza-
tions is that the NCAA aUows 
off-campus recruiting while 
the AlA W does not. This rule. 
however, is mainly directed 
towards scholarship schools, 
and would have no effect on 
UCSD. 

A second difference that 
could affect UCSD is that the 
NCAA pays for national 
competition and champion-
ships. while participating 
schools must pay their own 
bills in AIAW nationals. 

"Any decision to go NCAA 
would be economic, based on 
that," said Skief. adding, "It 
would be somewhat to our 
advantage to be in the 
NCAA."

Spikers can look U pp for good season 
BY SCOTT ALLISON 

Starr Writer 
This time of year usually 

marks the ~nning of the 
UCSD men s volleyball 
season, and usually accom· 
panying its arrival are 
preview stories featuring the 
lively quips and quotes that 
are the trademark of coach 
lJoug Dannevik. 

But a couple of peculiar and 
not so insignificant problems 
confronted the men spikers 
at the start of this 1981 
campaign. 

First, they found them· 
selves without the services of 
Dannevik, therefor!! without 
a head coach, and also the 
dubious possessors of a 
season budget that couldn't 
boast a single cent. In ot her 
words, the volleyball team 
was both orphaned and 
broke. and the same series of 
unfortunate circumstances 
seemed to be to blame for 
both. 

Yet before going into the 
details of what happened to 
men's volleyball at UCSD in 
the past year, it can be aid 
that UCSD d~ have a team 
for ] 981, and a fine one at 
that, coached on a volunteer 
basis by ex-Triton and 
former All-Leaguer Steve 
Upp" 

'I never really thought 
about coaching utllil one of 
the players approached me 
with the idea and I thought, 
why not?" said Upp. 

Upp replaces a man under 
whom he had served for two 
years, Dannevik. Apparently 
Dannevik stepped down from 
his coaching post when it was 

I 

learned that his team was 
being allotted no operat ing 
money for the upcoming year, 
a financial malady stemming 
from a Hawaiian trip his 
squad made last winter that 
to this day remains lar~ely 
unpaid for. The "aloha" debt , 
as it is beginning to be called, 
easilr swal lowed up this 
year s spending money for 
the team. 

"There's no way I could 
coach if I'm going to have to 
pay for my meal s, my 

lodgings and my transporta· 
tion," said Dannevik. "I have 
to make ends meet just like 
.anyone else." 

How the Hawaiian 
excursion broke the team's 
piggy bank and who's to 
blame for the lack of funds to 
pay for the trip is open to 
speculation. The coach 
blames some of the players 
and some of the players 
blame the coach . In the end 
both sides may be at fault. 

"I told the players what we 

TWO FACES OF STEVE - Two views of current men's 
volleyball coach Steve Upp a he appears now (left) during a 
practice in the Rec Gym, and then (right) helping a

had to do to raise the money, 
and I thought I gave -them 
plenty of time to do it," 
Dannevik claims . "Many of 
them didn't live up to their 
obligations ... 

Triton spiker Monte 
Frankel disagrees . "We 
didn't know where we stood, 
money· wise. We shouldn't 
have gone to Hawaii in the 
first place if we didn't have 
the money. It was stupid," he 
said. 

Dannevik still remains as 

head coach of the women's 
volleyball team, a job he has 
always expressed a greater 
liking for over his duties as 
bein~ the overseer of the 
men steam. 

"The women have always 
been much more rewarding 
to coach ." said Dannevik. 
"The future for me is in 
coaching women's volley· 

. ball." 
And since Dannevik can't 

say if he'll be back next year

as coach of the men 's team, 
the future for Steve Upp may 
be in coaching men 's 
volleyba lL 

Upp ha been hailed as no 
Ie s than the perfect man for 
the job. The respect and 
enthusiastic prai se that his 
players have tor him is 
amazing considering the 
Tritons have yet the play 
thei r first official match. 

that they may face . Last year 
Dannevik assembled a team 
that. with Upp as captian, 
was undoubtedly the most 
talented in UCSD history . 
And yet the squad lost many 
tough matches. 

This year's team has those 
same tough matches on their 
schedule, but only a few 
players from las t year' s 
talent-laden team ar e 
returning. The facelift may 

The team found itself without a 
coach and a budget that read zero. 

" It looked like we weren ' t 
even going to have a team. 
Steve's stepping in as coach 
was a last minute deal, but 
he's doing a great job so far 
just getting us together," 
said middle blocker Rick 
Cazares. 

"He's doing it for nothing," 
adds Hal Light , "so we have a 
lot of people playing hard." 

Uppand his 'plavers reinain 
unphased by the adversity 

help the Tritons in their 
attempts to exorcise last 
year's demons, but over-
coming the flood of youth 
they are now wading in may 
be their biggest obstacle. 

"I don ' t know if Upp knows 
what he 's getting himself 
into," concedes Cazares. 

One of the first things Upp 
did as coach was to enter 
UCSD in the All-Cal 
tournament two weekends

ago. His squad finished in 
fourth place, a great feat 
considering the players had 
practiced only four times 
before the competition . 

" I was pleased with the 
enthusiasm," ays Upp. "We 
pulled to~ether when we 
were down and played with a 
lot of heart. " 

Thus, t he 1981 men's 
volleyba ll package may be the 
most interesting to watch as 
it s lowly unfolds itself this 
year . The team has no right 
to do well in light of the 
Hawaiian turmoil, the loss of 
several front-line players, a 
new coach and no money. 

But happily the - atmo-
s here around the team is one 
of emphas is on what can be ... 
done, not on what is ua5t. 

"We can't do wotee than 
last year," says Light. "'T'hi., 
year will be fun." " 

"We have everything to 
~ain, " concludes Upp . 
'People will be surprised at 

how good we are." 

The meet was clo e. but 
with a s trong performance in 
the 400 free relay, the Triton 
clinched the win. 

Contributing to the win 
were good performances by 
Tracy Strahl and Dave Reed . 
Strahl led off the 400 medley 
relay with a 100 back split of 
56.4, only .2 second s off of the 
national qualifying time. 
Reed , a highly versatile 
fres hman , s haved several 
second off his 200 IM time 

Leading the women were 
Jackie van Egmond with wins 

r in the 200 1M (2:23.09) and 
200 back (2:27.08) and Ann 
Motekaitis with a lifetime 
best in the 200 free (2:16_97). 

Diver Maureen Kava-
naugh also had an outstand-
ing day as she handily won 
both the one meter and three 
meter diving events.

Aff. act'n 
is hurt 
continued from pale 16 
people," Miller said, ' 

As part of the arrange-
ment, the university also 
agreed to give up its annual 
request that the state fund 
the entire affirmative action 
and educational opportunity (EOP) programs, both 
designed to aid minority 
students in the university. 

The state had already 
agreed to take over complete 
funding of the affirmative 
action program for the first 
time next year, which would 
have freed up $1.1 million 
more. for student financial 
aid. all of which is drawn 
from the dwindling educa-
tional' fees students pay each 
quarter, Now. the ed fee fund 
is in trouble and new sources 
of financial aid will have to be 
found, 

Last week, when it was 
rumored increases for 
affirmative action would 
probably be denied next year, 
Assemblyman john Vascon .. 
cellos (D-San jose), former 
chairman of the fiscal 
subcommittee on education, 
said it would be "a mistake" 
because that is the area 
where UC has the worst 
record, 

Relatively- speaking, the 
University of California got 
off fairlr lightly in the 
Governor s budget, compared 
to the other segments of state 
public higher education, 
State colleges and universi-
ties and communitiy colleges 
received no new increases,

DC hits own Aff. Action programs 
Identified three areas as first to go in budget 

BY RICK DOWER 
Sacramenco Correapondent 

The University of Califor-
nia will receive no new 
funding for its affirmative 
action program or additional 
teaching assistants and only 
a modest increase overall for 
next year under the "painful 
choices" budget proposed by 
Governor Brown. 

The austere budget allows 
the university to continue 
operating at this year's level 
and "pay the bills." as one 
state budget analyst said. but 
provides . for VIrtually no 
mcreases In most programs. 

UC's budget for 19tH -82 is 
proposed for nearly $1.1 
billton out of the state's 
overall budget of $24.6 billion 
and will De adjusted for 
inflation. That translates 
into about $8,000 for each of 
the 135,000 students on nine 
UC campuses. 

The R~!1ts had requested 
a hike of $79 million, or seven 
percent. They got 3_9 percent. 

That does not include 
employee salary raises. 
which are negotiated 
separately. 

More than $5 million in 
enrichmenl money for 
affirmative action, new 
teaching assistants, remedial 
math instruction and several 
other programs was blue-
penciled by the university in 
last·minute negotiations 
with the state. All of that 
money had previously been 
approved by the Finance 
Department. 

Also failinglowin approval 
was a $450,000 request to 
continue a graduate 
affirmative action program 
begun last year. 

UC will receive $5 million 
from the state for a new 
computer research center at 
Berkeley. 

When the state's economic 
situation looked even 
grimmer than anticipated in 
December, UC officials were 
asked to come up with an 
additional $30 million in 
savings and decided to 
sacrifice all money for 
improvements across the 
board. About $18 million in 
reductions was finally agreed 
upon. 

VC, under pressure from 
the state, elected to give up 
$630,000 for affirmative 
action support services 
increases, $1.4 million for the 
basic skills deficiencies 
program - which would 
have meant 100 more 
teaching assistants - and 
around $3.4 million more in 
other student, instructional 
and facility related increases. 
Additional cuts came in 
promises to reduce utility 
costs and from the universi-
ty's Hospital Working 
Capital fund, state money 
paid to cover lost interest on 
bills due UC's five teaching 
hospitals. 

"We're optimistic we'll get 
some of it back," said Bill 
Baker, UC's assistant vice 
president for budget analysis 
and planning. "Affirmative 

Student 
Travel 
Services 

action is one of our highest 
priorities and we'll fight like 
heck to get it back." 

But Paul Rogers, UC 
Student Lobby co-director, 
said affirmative action 
increases, funds for new 
teaching assistants and the 
other programs were the first 
items the university offered 
to give away when asked by 
the state to make additional 
cuts. 

"It's not as though the 
state ordered UC to cut 
affirmative action and these 
other programs back, it asked 
what could be cut most easilr. 
and this was VC's answer, ' 
said Rogers . "This says to us 
that affirmative action and 
student program enrichment 
are a lower priority than 
anythin~ else in the 
university s budget." 

During those eleventh 
hour negotiations with the 
Finance Department, 
university officials at first 
suggested instituting tuition 
of $2,000 a year for graduate 
health science students and 
charging up to 35 percent 
more in out-of·state tuition 
next year instead of the 20 
percent hike already slated to 
come up with the unexpected 
cuts. 

Gov. Brown rejected both 
suggestions. 

Baker maintains the 
university didn't really have 
much choice in the matter of 
what to cut , saying "it was 
like the st<ll-e said 'we're 
going to cut off one of your 

limbs. you choose which 
one ... · 

So, he said, UC reluctantly 
decided to throw out all new 
program increases. 

But Dean Miller , UC 
budget analyst for the state 
Finance Department, said 
UC was given virtually a free 
hand in electing where it 

would make the necessary 
cuts. 

"We asked them whatthey 
wanted to give up first and 
they said they' d rather 
eliminate these new 
increases than cut into 
existing program s or 
research or begin firing

Two-tier schools

But there may be a special significance to a dividing line set 
at the "upper 40 percent." For while some black students have 
passed jnto the top 40 percent , most still remain below that 
dividing line. 

Indeed, to judge from test scores, a wide gulf persis ts 
between white and black achievement. In 1980. for example, 
white eighth-graders in Berkeley averaged reading scores in 
the 84th percentile on national exams. Black students on the 
average scored 55 points lower. The gap in math was s imilar 
- 84 for white eighth·graders, 46 for black. 

Though national figures on black and white achievement 
on these exams are not available, there is reason to believe 
that the gap in Berkeley is part of a broad pattern. A 1976 
study by the . Berkeley School Board turned up similar 
divergences between black and white achievement among 
sixth graders in Berkeley, Pasadena and San Francisco. 
effectively felt mainly by a minority of black youngsters. A 
small portion of black students have excelled and joined their 
white counterparts in genuinely integrated "advanced" 
classes. In the aggregate, however, black reading and math 
scores have remained largely unchanged . 

The result has been what amounts toa two-tiered system-
an upper tier of academically advanced classes with a 
somewhat balanced mixture of white and minority students, 
and a lower tier of regular academic classes filled with a 
disadvantaged educational "underclass" whose progress 
remains disturbingly slow.
