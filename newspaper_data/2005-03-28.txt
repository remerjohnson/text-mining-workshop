Service workers vote 
in favor of strike 

Union heads, university 
. . . 

to contInue negotIatIons 
By AMY IFURUNG 

Staff Writer 

After six months of bargaining 
with the university over wage 
increases, service workers 
employed by the University of 
California overwhelmingly voted 
in favor of walking off their jobs. 
In a poll that concluded voting on 
March 16, 92 percent said they 
supported a strike, though the 
vote does not mean that a strike 
will take place. 

"I don 't think the university 
thought we could pull these kinds 
of numbers off," said Je sica 
Lopez, an organizer for the 
American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal 
Employees Local 3299 - the 
union that represents UC service 
workers - and a 2002 John Muir 
College alunma. 

Voting took place at eight UC 
campuses from March 10 to 
March 16, after talks between 

AF CME 3299 and the university 
reached an impasse. A neutral , 
third-parry or "fact-finding" panel 
will attempt to re olve the differ-
ences between the sides. A repon 
by the panel is due March 3 1. 

" When the fact- finding is 
declared officially over, we can 
choose to take any number of 
actions, including a strike," said 
Faith Raider, a spokeswoman for 
the union. 

AFSCME held two rallies in 
the past year at Price enter, ask-
ing the university for a raise over 
the next three years and changes 
to the pay system to create higher 
wages based on seniol;ty. 

UC officials have responded 
by pointing to the state's budget 
crisis and reduced funding to the 
university, saying that they do not 
have the money to meet the 
demands. 

The university has said that it

LAO blasts governor's 
compact, budget plan 
Universities misspent state 

money, report alleges 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

News Editor 

In a critical repon calling Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's funding 
compact with public universities a 
form of "autopilot spending," the 
state's nonpartisan policy analyst's 
office has urged the Legislature 
to set next year's higher education 
budget below the levels requested 
by the governor. 

The 900-page breakdown of 
the governor's proposal, released 
last month by the state's 
Legislative Analyst's Office, also 
accuses the University of 
California and California State 
U niversity of diverting millions 
of dollars meant for increasing 
student enrollment into other 
programs over the last two years. 

"Rather than allowing for an 
annual review to reassess budget 
assumptions, the governor's com-
pact seeks automatic spending 
increases for UC and CSU," the 
LAO study states. "We believe 
the Legislature should reject the 
compact's autopilot approach and 
continue to use the annual bud-
getary process to allocate 

resources to the segments." 
When he released his plan in 

January, Schwarzenegger criti-
cized budget formulas and 
autopi lot spending, including the 
Proposition 98 funding guarantee 
for public schools. 

However, the governor's bud-
get spokesman, H.D. Palmer, said 
the compact with the two univer-
sities, which guarantees the sys-
tems a three-percent budget 
increase this year that will grow 
to five percent in three years, is 
not the kind of formula 
Schwarzenegger had in mind. 

"This kind of funding com-
mitment is definitely affordable," 
Palmer said, pointing out that the 
growth is still less than the annu-
al increase in the state's revenue, 
which averages between six and 
seven percent. "We recognize 
that higher education in the state 
is integral to the state's economic 
well-being. Even as we are con-
tinuing to work our way out of 
the state's worst economic crisis 
in recent memory, the governor 
believes that the commitment to

Campus 
short of cash 

to rebuild 
By CHRlmNE CLARK 

Senior Staff Writer 

The UC Office of the President 
has extended the campus' March 
fundraising deadline by a month 
because administrators failed to raise 
enough money to pay for the $7.2 
million University House project, 
according to Vice Chancellor of 
External Affairs James M Langley. 

The project proposes to demol-
ish the existing Univer ity House, 
whjch serves as the home of the 
UCSD chancellor, and build a new 
residence on the La J olla Farms 
property. 

Langley said he requested the 
extension because several other pri-
vately funded and ongoing univer-
sity projects have made finding 
additional donors for recon truc-
tion especially difficult.

Student groups urge 
Cal Grant reform

Senior Staff Writer 

tudents who take ti me off 
after high school or enter college 
later than the typica l freshman 
would find it easier to obtain aid 
under new legislation co-spon-
sored by University of California 
and California State U niversity 
student o rganizations. 

Critics of the present Ca l 
Grant system believe the state's 
fi nancial aid program discrimi-
nates against older individuals and 
those with familie o r children, 
and are looking for ways to make 
current allocation methods more 
fair by ensuring that the need iest 
students receive funding. 

Established in 2000, the Cal 
G rant program allocates fin ancial 
aid using · one of two methods. 
One pool of money is known as 
the Entitlement Program, which 
serves all needy students who 

apply for aid with in 18 months of 
high school graduation and meet 
other co rresponding rcquire-
ments relating to fa mily income 
and grades. The second and 
small er category, the 
Competitive Program, consists of 
all other eligible applicants com-
peting for 22,500 annual awards. 
It also allows older snldents to 
compete against ther needy stu-
dents enrolled at C, CS and 
Ca lifornia community college 
campuses and private instinltions. 

T he bill , sponsored by the UC 
Students sociation and the 
Ca li fo rn ia State Student 
Association, calls fo r the elimi na-
tion of the 18-month post-gradu-
ation time limit. 

"While eve ryo ne who 
receives a Ca l Gra nt from the 
Entitlement Program is needy, 
some are less needy than those in

Strike: Administrators would 
allow staff to cross picket lines 

concinued from page I 
intends to averr the possibility of 
a strike. However, admini strators 
could not say what will happen if 
one occurs, explaining that they 
hope a resolution can be found 
before a work stoppage takes 
place. 

"Sooner rather than later, it's 
really necessary that we bring a 
conclusion to this process," 
Assis tant Vice Chancellor of 
Human Relations Rogers Davis 
said." obody is trying to pro-
tract it." 

[n the event of strike, howev-
er, the university said it would 
protect the service workers who 
choose not to partake. 

"We'll guard and protect the 
right of workers who want to 
work and don't want to strike," 
Davis said. : We're seeking state 
assistance in dealing with these 
issues at the bargaining table." 

The union has remained silent 
about the details of its ac tioflS 
should a strike occur, induding 
such issues as how long work 
stoppage would last. In addition, 
the union does not have any 
money to compensate workers 
through the duration of a strike, 
Raider said. 

By comparison, the five 
Southern California locals of the 
Uni ted Food and Commercial 
Workers union were able to pro-
vide partial wages for their work-
ers during the months-long labor 
dispute with major grocers 
between October 2003 and 
February 2004. 

The union and the university 
are deadlocked on an estimated 
30 issues, AFSCME organizing 
director Jane McDonald stated 
in a press release. Those cur-
rently on the bargaining table 
include issues as varied as custo-
dial uniforms and worker sched-
ules. 

"The university is legally 
required to bargain over workers' 
rights, and we're willing to nego-
tiate," Raider said. "But so far, 
[the university) has been in bad 
fa ith ." 

Although it is unknown what 
will occur after the fact-finding 
proceedings with AFSCME, 
another un ion, the Coalition of 
University Employees, has 

. recently seen its dispute compli-
cated following a third-party 
report. 

C.U.E., in negotiations with 
the university si nce July 2003, 
represents 18,000 clerical work-
ers employed by the university. 
T he union has its eyes set on 
adjustment of health benefits, 
changes to parking rates and 
wage increases. 

Fact-finding proceedings in 
those talks were completed Feb. 
7, followed by a I O-day period in 
which both parties participating 
in the mediation were legally 
required to stay silent regarding 
the proceedings. 

C.U.E., in violation .ofthe 10-
day period, publicized the reports 
of the fact-finding panel, an 
action that the wuversity stated 
would "threaten the possibility of 
an agreement." Negotiations, 
however, are still taking place. 

"Both the union and the uni-
versity are obliged to bargain in 
good faith throughout the entire 
collective bargaining process, a 
process in which the parties are 
still engaged, and the university 
- despite the union's repeated 
misconduct - continues to 
attempt to meet with C.U.E. rep-
resentatives over possible resolu-
tions of outstanding differences," 
UC spokesman Noel Van Nyhuis 
stated in a February press release.

Two candidates 

kicked out of race 
Two A.S. hopefuls running on the 

Revolution! slate have been disquali-
fied from competing. according to the 
slate's presidential candidate Kevin 
Hanson. 

The A.S. Elections Committee 
voted to rule that junior Nate Jones -
the lone candidate for the post of ath-
letics commissioner - was ineligible 
to participate in the election on the 
basis of technicalities stemming from 
his filing. Elections Manager Steve 
York said the committee was unani-
mous in its decision. 

Though Jones had completed all 
necessary paperwork to compete, a 
family emergency took him out of 
town on the filing day, according to 
Hanson, making him unavailable to 
personally submit the documents. 

Jones disqualification means that 
the position will be filled by appoint-
ment, per AS Council bylaws. 

In addition, Earl Warren College 
freshman Brett Laddusaw was 
deemed ineligible to run for the col-
lege's sophomore senator after a 
grade verification showed that he did 
not meet the minimum 3.0 GPA 
required under A.S. election bylaws to 
run for an office. Laddusaw had fi led 
to run as a candidate with Revolution! 
at Warren. 

"Brett didn't make the grades: 
Hanson said. "Those are the rules." 

Laddusaw's disqualification in one 
of the most competitive college races 
on campus will leave three other can-
didates to vie for the spot. 

Committee calls for 
better accountability 

The National Commission on 
Accountability in Hi~er Education -
set up by an association of higher edu-
cation executive officers - has warned 
that lax accountability standards in the 
country's universities are threatening 
America's role as the intemational 
leader in college education. 

"For over 50 years, the United 
States could rightfully claim to have 
the finest system of higher education 
in the world in terms of access, grad-
uates and research." the commis-
sion's final report states. "Today, this 
basic assumption is under chal-
lenge." 

Co-<:haired by former Oklahoma 
govemor Frank Keating and former 
Education Secretary Richard Riley, the 
commission backed a proposed fed-
eral student-data collection system 
that has come under fire by privacy 
advocates. In addition, the report 
urges more investment in colleges 
and student aid. In exchange for more 
money, it asks university administra· 
tors to make better use of "external 

••• 

and intemal assessments of leaming" 
and to ·publicly communicate the 
results to monitor and improve [stu-
dent] performance." 

"Too often, calls for greater 
accountability result in a tug-of-war 
that frustrates everyone: State Higher 
Education Executive Officers Executive 
Director Paul Lingenfelter stated in a 
press release. "A guiding principle of 
this report is that we all need to pull in 
the same direction - pursuing clear 
goals, insisting on rigorous measure-
ments of results and working collabo-

rative~ for improvement." 
The State Higher Education 

Executive Officers commissioned the 
report. 

Campus near top for 
study abroad 

UCSD ranked third in the nation 
last year for the number of students 
participating in full-year study abroad 
programs, new data released by the 
International Center show. With more 
than 950 students involved in one of 
two abroad programs, the university 
led all other campuses in the 
University of Califomia system. 

The participating students received 
more than ~400,OOO in study,abroad 
scholarships. 

In addition, the campus was 
ranked fourth in the country among 
research institutions for the number 
of "intemational scholars" wOrking at 
the university, with a total of 1,929 
academic researchers and faculty 
from outside of the country. 

Last year, UCSO also saw its inter-
national student numbers climb by 
more than 200 to a total of 1,811, 
despite significant declines through-
out the nation. CNer the last decade, 
the campus' international student 
population has more than doubled. 

Former music chair 
dies at age 82 

John Joseph Silber, the second 
chair of UCSO's music department 
and a former City of Del Mar council-
man, died earlier this month at UCSO 
Medical Center. Eighty-two at the time 
of his passin~ Silber is suNived by his 
wife and eight children. 

The improvisational trombonist, 
who retired in 1991, had performed 
throughout the world, from Belgium 
to Australia, and served in the Nail)' 
during World War II. 

"John was a quintessential faculty 
member for the UCSO music depart-
ment" music department chair John 
r onville stated in a university press 
release. "He had wide-ranging inter-
ests, not only in music but written 
text, poetry, movement and a host of 
other passions in the creative 
domain."

·House: Unions criticize cost of project 
continued from page I 

history of fundraising at UCSD 
thus far," Langley said. "We have 
pushed a lot of projects on top of 
many important initiatives, but we 
don't want to confuse the donor 
base." 

However, Langley said he 
thinks a one-month extension will 
allow for more donors to come for-
ward. 

"I would not have asked for the 
extension if I did not think we 
could be successful," Langley said. 
"Initially, we were given a very 
short period of time, but we did the 
best we could. Sometimes the 
donors take time to respond after 
you contact them because they 
don't feel the project has the same 
urgency that we do." 

UCOP will provide a portion of 
the necessary funds to rebuild the 
University House, according to 
UCOP Communications Director 
Brad Hayward. 

"There is talk [of$\ million), but 
there is nothing final," Hayward 
said. "However, we have been very 
clear that the vast majority needs to 
be done with private funds from the 
campus fundraising." 

If campus administrators are 
unable to meet the new deadline, 
they will be forced to consider sell-
ing the property and rebuilding 
elsewhere, according to Langley. 

He said that he would not reveal 
the exact numbers of the fundrais-
ing effort because the contributions 
will have to be returned to the 
donors if not enough money is 
raised. However, he has objected to 
exploring other housing options. 

"At this point, it is hard to tell 
whether or not we will be able to 

raise the funds, but I have been on 
record objecting to selling the 
property," Langley said. "It would 
be a permanent solution to a tem-
porary problem. The properry is a 
unique asset of the university; it is a 
remarkable piece of real estate. It 
has been used to recruit faculty and 
entert3in several officials." 

However, the University House 
project has drawn criticism from 
campus workers' labor groups. 

Fred Lonidier, a visual arts pro-

" Next year's fees are going 
up, but they can pay far a 
swanky new house in La 
Jolla far the chancellor." 

- Denise Mitc:hek.a . 
officer, Coalition r 

University Employees 

fessor and president of tI,e union 
that represents the university'S lec-
turers and librarians, said that 
funding the project should not be 
the top priority of the university. 

"If you are going to raise private 
money, why not use it to build 
classes?" Lonidier said. "We are in 
a period of budget crisis. There is a 
crunch for classroom space here. 
They are packing in students and 
the buildings that house the classes 
are not keeping up. I had to cut my 
class from two hours to one hour 
twice a week just to compete for 
space." 

However, the funds provided by 

UCOP for the University House 
will not come from private money 
that pays for the academic needs of 
the university, according to 
Hayward. 

"~ have non-state money that 
is available to cover costs outside 
academics," Hayward said. "No 
one is saying that this is the most 
important need of the university, 
but housing for the chanceIlor is an 
important consideration; these 
facilities play a number of impor-
tant roles for the university." 

An .,fficer of the Coalition of 
University Employees, Denise 
Mitchell-Carignan, said that the 
timing of the project is question-
able, considering the university's 
financial challenges. C.U.E. is cur-
rently in wage negotiations with 
UC administrators. 

"They haven't even been giving 
merit increases for the faculty," 
Carignan said. "Next year's fees are 
going up, but they can pay for a 
swanky new house in La Jolla for 
the chancellor. How could [UC 
President Robert C. Dynes) do this 
in good conscience'" 

T he university is obliga ted 
under its contract to provide hous-
ing for the chancellor, according to 
Hayward. 

UCOP commissioned the reno-
vation of University House after a 
report revealed that the building 
had serious seismic concerns. 
Because the facility is inhabitable, 
UCOP signed a two-year lease to 
pay S~, 500 per month for a rented 
residence to house Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox.

D,I sports not right for UCSD 
NCAA report shows most athletes don't graduate' 

By BRYAN TSAG 
Opinion Editor 

In a recently released report, 
the NCAA found that nearly 50 
percent of Division I schools have 
at least one sports program that 
fails to graduate even 50 percent 
of its student-athletes, with the 
worst offenders being men's bas-
kerball and football . In an era 
when CBS is paying the NCAA $6 
billion for the broadcast rights to 
March l\tladness and major confer-
ences are receiving payouts of 
nearly $20 million for placing 
teams in the BCS bowls, it should-
n't surprise anyone that college 
sports have become more about 
the dollars than love of the game. 

And of course, to get at this 
embarrassment of riches, universi-
ties - even public ones - are 
pouring more and more money 
into their athletic departments. 
The University of Texas, one of 
the top public universities aca-
demically, recently complet-
ed a $50 million renovation 
of its basketball arena. The 
University of Florida, a 
basketball and football 
powerhouse, opened a 
$10 million practice 
facility for its basket-
ball team in 2001. 
Not even its main 
facility, mind you 
- its practice 
facility. 

Granted, the 
money likely 
comes from 
boosters and 
alumni who 
would probably 
not donate to 
academics any-
way, but as the 
NCAA report 
shows, the cost is more 
than financial. The top 
football and basketball 
recruits needed to build a 
successful program are no 
longer making even a pre-
tense of being in school for 
an education; they see college as a 

steppingstone to the pros. If 
UCSD were to have a successful 
Division I football or basketball 
program, it would have to sacrifice 
its academic standards to get the 
players needed to build a winner 
- and those players would see 
UCSD as nothing more than a 
means to a big payday. Even 
worse, many of these recruits 
commit to schools based not on 
the school or the coach or the 
program, but simply based on how 
much money or how many under-
the-table benefits the school is 
willing to provide.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITORS 
Abortion providers 

threatened 
Dear Editor: 

March 10 marked the lOth 
annual National Day of 
Appreciation for Abortion 
Providers. This date was chosen to 
conunemorate the anniversary of 
the murder of Dr. David Gunn by 
an anti-abortion extremist in March 
1993. The day honors all the dedi-
cated medical professionals who 
have continued to provide safe and 
legal abortion care for women in the 
face of terrorist acts of violence and 
constant harassment. Without their 
heroism, perseverance and commit-
ment, true reproductive choicr for 
women would not exist. 

This year's anniversary is espe-
cially poignant. Members of the 
reproductive health community 
are under increasing assault. A 
recent example is the Senate's fail-
ure to adopt an amendment to 
hold anti -abortion extremists 
financially responsible when 
found guilty of acts of domestic 
terrorism against medical person-
nel. Sadly, without the recom-

mended changes, guilty individu-
als are able to exploit bankruptcy 
protection laws to avoid paying 
court-ordered fines. 

Other assaults are more insidi-
ous. Eighty-seven percent of U.S . 

" Eighty-seven percent of U. S. counties do not 
have a single abortion 

provider. Nearly one,half

ball program, supposedly as 
squeaky-clean as they come, was 
implicated in a recruiting sc dal 
in 2004 when it was discovered 
that former player Corey 
Maggette had received illegal 
payments from agents while sup-
posedly still an "amateur." A sim-
ple Google search for "NCAA 
recruiting violations" returns 
35,600 results . We might as well 
hire people to put on UCSD jer-
seys and play for us. College ath-
letics are not meant to be like 
that. College sports are supposed 
to be about rooting for a group of 
your peers who represent your 
school, not rooting for the best 
players your school's money can 
buy. 

And all the additional alumni 
donatinns thar would supposedly 
result from a big-time athletics 
program? How much of them 
would go to students, and how 
much would go to the multimil-
lion-dollar facilities, coaches and 
"incentives" needed to compete? 

It's easy to point at UCSD's 
lack of an exciting athletics pro-
gram as the reason UCSD sup-
posedly lacks school spirit or has 
a low alumni donation rate. Of 
course, the school with the 
nation's largest endowment, 
Harvard University, also lacks a 
glitzy athletics program. Of the 
top five schools in Princeton 
Review's "Happiest Students" 
ranking, only one (Stanford) has 
a high-profile athletics pro-
gram. 

Sure, it would be fun to see 
the UCSD Tritons in March 

Madness or go to the 
Rose Bowl to root for a 

Triton football team. 
But when you get right 

down to it, that wouldn 't 
be too different from going to a 
Lakers game because you're from 
Los Angeles or a 4gers game 
because you're from San 

Francisco. Having the school 
spend millions of dollars and a lot 
of effort to essentially hire pro 
teams to play for UCSD would be 
a fool's errand.

Planning is just 
wishful thinking 

indecent 
exposure 
Marianne Madden 

I r's the first week of spring quarter. Do you have your career mapped out yet? 
Well, then, how about grad 

school? 
Your summer? Please, tell me 

you have your summer planned! 
If you've ever been assaulted 

with a line of questioning such as 
this, not only are you not unique 
in the slightest, but you probably 
complain about it a lot, too. Let 
me guess: You want to work for a 
nonprofit, but your parents are 
hell-bent on having their precious 
offspring become a CEO . Or you 
want to smoke pot all summer, but 
your wallet demands that you put 
in extra hours spitting in the ourg-
ers at Islands. Or, God forbid, you 
want to skip grad school and 
begin your foray 

" 

ly doubt the telemarketers, 
garbagemen and Wal-Mart stock-
boys of the world planned to end 
up where they have. Actually, in a 
fictional survey I conducted of 
people in these jobs, a full 68 per-
cent said they did not plan to go 
into the field they did and instead 
planned to be "a billionaire jet-
setter with three Porsches and a 
Range Rover"; 21 percent said 
they had planned to be "the guy 
that publishes all those porno 
mags." Another 11 percent said, 
"Get eff my lawn." Fictional sur-
veys don't lie, folks . 

Career "planning" (it's really 
just wishful thinking) is wonder-
fully, delightfully futile, especially 
considering today's job marker. A 
non-made-up statistic I like to 
throw out is that on average, peo-
ple will change careers - not just 
jobs, but careers - eight times 
over the course of their lives. 
"You mean, I'm not going to be a 
doctor?" the biology major sobs, 
rolling into the fetal position . No, 
sir, you're probably nor. If all 
UCSD bio majors actually fol-

into the wild and 
wooly working 
world the minute 
UCSD is done with 
you. While having 
disagreeable par-
ents, unreasonable 
goals or a desire to 
break the over-
achiever tnold is 
definitely a prob-
lem, there is a 
much bigger prob-
lem here. 

It's spring break, and 
I planned to go party 

it up in Mexico or 
maybe the Bahamas. 

lowed through on 
the whole med 
school and doctor 
thing, well , we 'd 
have a lot of doc-
tors, and where 
would we go 
when we needed 
an unlicensed 
body piercer 
operating out of a 
gra Hi ti -covered 
van? But instead 1'm 

The problem is 
that we're sup-
posed to plan -
but, honestly, what 
has planning ever 
done for anyone? 
It's spring break, 
and I planned to go 
party it up in 

sitting in my 
underwear typing a 
column with nary a 

beer ar a grain of 
sand in sight. " 

Sure, YOI:! scoff 
now. To some 
degree or another, 
we all hang on to 
the elementary 
logic of "study 
psychology in col-
lege, become a 
psychologist , " 
"study history in 

Mexico or maybe the Bahamas. 
But instead I'm sitting in my 
underwear typing a column with 
nary a beer or a grain of sand in 
sight. See what planning is good 
for? Nothing. 

Especially planning months or 
even years ahead. When we were 
in high school, the pressure was 
on to plan our college careers 
before we'd even mastered the art 
of the locker combination. Before 
we even had our drivers' licenses, 
we were supposed to know what 
university we were attending, 
what our major would be, what 
dorm we would live in, what pro-
fessor we would despise and what 
disgusting habit we would ostra-
cize our roommate for having. All 
this, before we'd blown off a sin-
gle AP test, SAT prep course or 
college application. If a friend 
dared to earn a higher GPA than 
us, it was just cause to stop return-
ing phone calls and spread vicious 
rumors behind his or her back. 
SAT scores broke up whole 
cliques. And college acceptances 
- the drama! The intrigue! The 
sobbi ng! 

And after all that, was college 
any respite? Of course not - we 
have grad school, summers in 
Europe and careers to plan for -
as if studying in Scotland or tak-
ing on that extra internship will 
spare us from a "career" in a soul-
crushing, dead-end job after col-
lege. 

Not to be cynical or anything 
(Me, cynical? Never!), but I high-

college, become a 
historian," "study physics in col-
lege, become Stephen Hawking," 
and so forth down the line. If only 
it were that simple. More likely, 
the psychology majors will make 
really great strippers one day, the 
history majors will stage kick-ass 
Civil War reenactments on their 
neighbors' lawns and physics 
majors will blow themselves up in 
homemade rocket ships. 

The best are the people who 
say they're planning to become 
professors. So, you're working on 
making your handwriting illegi-
ble, your hair and wardrobe 
obnoxiously quirky and your 
moods either suspiciously con-
stant or dangerously volatile? 
Gosh, that must be hard work. 
When a student says he or she 
wants to be a professor, it's code 
for, "I want to stay at college for-
ever and make my students' lives 
as miserable as my life is right 
now." But hey - without them, 
who would give business to the 
psychology-majors -tu rned -stri p-
pers and the economics-majors- , 
turned-spammers selling "quality 
Canadian pharmaceuticals"? 

Now, to wax philosophical for 
a moment: Screw planning. No 
planning in the world can trump 
simple ability. 

So, what GRE prep course are 
you taking?

Grants: Proposal calls for 
gradual phase .. in to save funds 

continued [TOm page r 
the Competitive Program," CSSA 
Director of Government 
Relations Laura Kerr said. "This 
currently discrimi nates based on 
an applicant's age, and it's not 
fair. " 

Introduced in February by 
Assemblyman Jerome Horton (0-
Inglewood), the bill would allow 
independent srudems, defined by the 
federal goverrunent as any srudents 
24 years of age or over, to compete 
for both fund . These srudents are 
now disqualified from the entitle-
ment pool because most graduated 
from high school more than a year 
and a half before they apply for aid. 

People denied aid under cur-
rent rules are the very students 
who should be encouraged in 
their pursuit of education, the 
CSSA has argued. Of qualified 
non-recipients who receive com-
petitive Cal Grant awards, 60 per-
cent are women, with an average 
age of 27 and annual income of 
$18,000. 

"It is in the state's interest to 
provide needy women with families 
with the opportuni ty to go to 
school - it's an investment for the 
long-term result," Kerr said. 

UCSA President Jennifer Lilla 
said that the educational interest of 
all Californians must be supported, 
regardless of age. 

"The typical California State 
University student isn't 20, but 
more like 26 or 27 years old," Lilla 
said. "[n a time of decreasing insti -
rutional and federal aid , we are 
doing anything we can to increase 
the access of ed ucation to every-
one." 

In the applicant pool of 
136,200 eligibl e students in 2003-
04, only 16 percent, or about one 
in six, received competitive 

awards, according to the 
California Student Aid 
Commission. Approximately . 
114,000 qualified students did not 
receive needed funding. 

A spokesman for the CSAC 
declined to comment on the pro-
posal. 

"It 's time for us to sta rt talking 
about these issues and reform the 
current system," Kerr sajd. "First , 
we need to use state dollars wise-
ly. Second, we need to ensure that 
there aren 't barriers to needy 
folks, and not discriminate based 
on age ." 

If passed, the bill would be 
implemented in 2006. Kerr said she 
acknowledges that, while the 
process is in its early stages, spon-
sors and legislators are looking at 
implementing the current bill in 
multiple phases to deal with costs. 

"By gradually expa nding the 
deadline to apply [for the funds) 
from 18 to 24 to 36 months, the 
financial impact can be softened 
and qualified students can hope-
fully receive their funding," Kerr 
said. 

Li lla said she has no doubts the 
plan will be expensive, but she also 
believes the program to be well 
worth it. 

"There have been several years 
when the Cal Grant program has 
been threatened, and that generally 
corresponds with these fiscal 
crises," Lilla said. "Increasing the 
amount of money in the pool is up 
to the legislators, but the money 
required to implemenr this will be 
negligible in the long run ... and 
will support the long-advocated 
variety of undergraduate financial 
need."

LAO: An~lyst urges lower 
s·tate support for UC, CSU 

continued fTOm page I 
funding higher education growth is 
important, and that's why the gov-
ernor's budget fulfills the commit-
ment he made to (UC] President 
[Robert C.] Dynes and [CSU] 
Chancellor [Charles B.] Reed." 

The report has also drawn criti-
cism from the UC Office of the 
President, which said the LAO did 
not take into account major cuts 
the university has worked through 
in recent years. 

"We completely disagree with 
it," UCOP Communications 
Director Brad Hayward said. "We 
believe the compact is a critical 
tool for helping the university 
recover from the budget cuts of the 
last several years. That is the criti-
cal factor missing from the LAO 
analysis : There is no recognition of 
what we have gone through in this 
four-year period." 

In a separate recommendation, 
the LAO also urged lawmakers to 
include a provision in the state's 
budget requiring the universities to 
refund taxpa yers if they enroll a 
smaller-than-expected number of 
students. Since 2003, both the 
CSU and UC systems have used 
such leftover money to "backfill" 
state cuts in other university pro-
grams, the analyst's report stated. 

Most of this diversion was car-
ried out by CSU administrators, 
according to LAO higher educa-
tion analyst Anthony Simbol, 
though UC staff also misspent 
money earmarked for enrolling an 
extra 800 students. 

Hayward strongly denied the 
charge. saying that any state money 
was "put to the purpose for which 
it was intended." 

In addition, the state analyst 
said the two-and-a-half-percent 
UC enrollment growth called for 
by the governor was excessive. 
Instead, the LAO recommended 
that the Legislature approve only a 
two-percent hike. That level is 
enough, it said, to pay for annual 
growth in the size of graduating 
high school classes and also to 
cover a moderate increase in the 
rate of college participation. 

That recommendation was dis-
puted by H ayward, who said the 
university could not understand 
which data the LAO used for its 
estimate. 

The LAO estimate does not 
account for demographic numbers 
collected by the federal govern-
ment that project rapid increases in 
minority populations over the next 
half a decade, according to UC 
Students Association President 
Jennifer Lilla. In addition, the 
numbers do not figure in increased 
college participation that will result 
from the millions the university has 
invested in academic preparation 
programs or outreach, she said. 

"What they were doing basical-
ly sort of smells of putting your 
head in the sand - to not expect 

growth to change and rates of par-
ticipation to change," Lilla said. 

Though critics can attack his 
agency's numbers, Simbol said, his 
office relied on the best data the 
state had, which he said were far 
more scientific than the arbitrary 
formulas used by the university to 
estimate changes in population. 

"They don't have a demograph-
ic model," he said . "We haven't 
seen anything tha t's based on 
demographics." 

As for outreach, Simbol said he 
has seen no evidence that academic 
preparation lead to increases in 
rates of college participation. 

Even if the governor's estimate 
of student numbers is right, the 
report also objected to the amount 
Schwarzenegger wants to give the 
university to pay for each addition-
al student. 

In 1995, lawmakers approved a 
formula to calculate how much the 
state should pay UC administrators 
for new srudents. This "marginal 
rate" is less than the normal per-
student price tag because it relies 
on savings from the same econom-
ic logic that explains why con-
sumers can pay less buying in bulk: 
Each additional student does not 
affect the university's fixed costs, 
like the number of administrators, 
so having more students decreases 
the average cost for each one. 

The governor's Department of 
Finance estimated a marginal rate 
of 57 ,588 for new students, but was 
unable to justify the numbers to the 
LAO, which used the 1995 
methodology to come up with 
$7,180. 

"We believe that the funding 
growth that we provided in this 
budget was the product of discus-
sion that the governor and the 
administration had with the leader-
ship of the UC and CSU," said 
Palmer, who is the deputy director 
of external affairs at the 
Department of Finance. "We 
agreed that this was the appropri-
ate level of funding to provide." 

In fact, Schwarzenegger's num-
ber is probably not high enough, 
Hayward said, since it relies on 
outda ted faculty salaries, and 
because larger annual growth in 
student numbers means the popu-
lation is no longer increasing "at 
thl. margin." 

"We believe, if anything, it's tpo 
low, even though we were under-
standing of the state's budget situa-
tion and willing to accept the figure 
in the governor's budget," he said . 

In contrast to the LAO's find-
ings, the Democrat-dominated 
Legislature has generally accused 
Schwarzenegger of underfunding 
higher education. Under state law, 
the Legislarure and the governor 
must agree on a state budget by the 
beginning ofJuly.

Hanson: Candidate to seek A.S. autonomy 
cominued from page 10 

Murphy and Harry Khanna, both 
of Pi Kappa Alpha, John Muir 
College ophomore am Bui from 
Sigma Chi and Muir junior Angela 
Fornero from Delta Garnnla. 

However, the notion that his 
choices for executives were based 
on Greek system affiliation is 
absurd, Hanson said . 

"I fully realize tha t my execu-
tives are Greek, but they all also 
[held A.S. positions before]," he 
said . "They all are extremely qual-
ified, and I ran them because 1 
knew they were best for the job. 
So while my executives happen to 
be Greek, their being affiliated 
with a Greek organization had 
nothing to do with their selection 
to be on my slate." 

Though the name he picked for 
the slate matches that of another 
from the late 1990s - which, too, 
was closely ti ed to Greek organiza-
tions - Hanson said the coinci-
dence was unintentional , since he 
had never heard of the group when 
making his decision. 

Hanson also said that in dealing 
with the monetary maners of the 
A.S. COlHlcil this past year, he was 
able to formulate his own ideas of 
where the council needed to direct 
its attention in the future. 

"I [have) a strong grasp of how 
AS. functions, and just about every 
part of AS. needs money in some 
way, and it all passed over my desk, 
so I could see what our money was 
being pent on," he said. "1 grew 
pretty passionate about A.S., and I 
have a direction I want to take it in." 

Hanson 's vision for Associated 
Students is the eventual autonomy 
of the council from campus 
administrators, a goal he feels CUT-
rent A.S. PresidentJenn Pac took 
great strides to accomplish this 
year. Consequently, the main 

issues he intends to address if 
elected include increased control 
over student fee . 

Specifically, Hanson plans for 
cenain sraff positions funded by 
A.S. activity fees to be supplied with 
money by the Registration Fee 
Advisory Comminee instead. The 
RFAC comprises students and 
graduate students from various 
organizations who report to Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson concerning the 
appropriation of registration fee 
funds. This action, Hanson said, 
wiU "free up tens of thousands of 

" So while my executives 
happen to be Greek, their 

being affiliated with a 
Greek arganization had 
nothing w liD with their 
selection to be on my 

late " s .

candidate, Revo ution! 

dollars, possibly closer to 
$100,000." 

Of course, the plans would first 
need to be approved by the com-
mittee - on which the council con-
trols just one appointment - and 
be accepted by Watson. And that is 
far from certain. Last year, for 
example, the entire committee -
including the single A.S. represen-
tative - balked at a plan supported 
by the AS. Council that would have 
reduced the stipends of RFAC 
members. 

If the plan passes, Hanson plans 
to use the surplus to delegate more 
money to strengthen student orga-
nizations and programming. 

When campaigning for his cur-
rent position last year, Hanson set 
out to make it easier for student 
organizations to receive funding, a 
goal he feels he has accomplished. 

"I opened the office up a bit 
more than it has been in the past. ". 
If student orgs couldn't make a 
funding workshop to apply for 
funding, 1 set up one-on-one meet-
ings with them to go over the 
process, rather than just " . reject 
their funding request," Hanson 
said. 

Hanson considers some of the 
other candidates' plans for the cam-
pus to be "unrealistic, n such as 
SunGod Party presidential candi-
date Daniel Watts' plans to improve 
the availability of student parking 
on campus. Watts has promi ed to 
work to convert some campus "B" 
spaces to "S" spots if elected as 
presidem. 

"Parking is not provided by A.s. 
- it is provided by the 'administra-
tion," Hanson said. "I, like every 
other AS. president before me, 
would do my best to advocate for 
more student parking ". but other 
than advocate and sit on commit-
tees, there is not much more AS. 
can do." 

For achieving his goals, howev-
er, Hanson once again points 
toward AS. autonomy, a concept 
that he believes will allow the coun-
cil to contend better against, and 
gain more power over, the campus 
administration. 

"If AS. emerges as a very finan-
cially stable, independent organiza-
tion, then it will be easier to get our 
way because the administration will 
not want to go against an organiza-
tion like tim," he said.

Watts: Budget plan relies on

However, the festivities would 

come at a price: Under Watts' plan, 
each college council would lose

fourths from its current total of

"The president proposes the 
budget, and it's this fancy outline of 
what h~ or she wants passed," Pae 
said. "But being realistic, it's the 
senate that's going to approve it. 
They're the ones who are going to 
decide what the budget is going to 
look like." 

Last year, it took more than 
three weelcs of negotiations for Pae 
to get her plan approved, with the

of the guaranteed block of money 
they get each year and would instead 
go before the A.S. Council to ask for 
funding on a project-by-project 
basis. 

A.S. members could also come 
back to petition for extra travel 
funding during the year, if they can 
justify it, Watts said . 

Though I she did not want to 
discuss the proposals of specific 
candidates for fear of sounding 
partisan, Thurgood Marshall 
College Student Council Chair 
Becky Lee said any reduction in 
A.S. support for (:ouncils could 
mean no Marshall palooza next 
year. As the council with the small -
est activity fee, Watts ' proposal 
would mean a 5-percent cut for 
Marshall. 

While going to the A.S. 
Council for more money for spe-
cific projects during the year might 
work in theory, Lee said, senators 
have become stingier about sharing 
the unallocated A.S. budget with 
colleges. 

The cuts to travel could also 
jeopardize the ability of elected 
representatives to lobby on behalf 
of students, while a smaller preset 
allocation proposed by Watts 
would make it difficult for the A.S. 
External Office to budget for the 
year, according to A.S. President 
Jenn Pae. 

Watts would also need a major-
ity of the 24-member AS. Senate 
to approve the cuts, including 
eliminating almost $55,000 in 

' stipends paid to student govern-
ment members and workers at the 
student-funded television and 
radio stations. The SunGod Party 
slate has only five senatorial candi-
dates, meaning that even a sweep 
by the slate would require Watts to 

val. In addition, he expects the cur-
rent council to leave nearly 
$140,000 unspent for use next year. 

Pae had that amount of carry-
forward to use last spring, but it 
was unusually large as the result of 
one-time transfers from old 
accounts, she said . 

Budget aside, Watts said he 
knows what students want and has 
the experience and ideas to get it. 

On the campus political scene, 
Watts is no newcomer. Two years 
ago, he successfully ran to 
become the Warren Coll ege 
Student Coun cil president, 
before resigning several weeks 
later after protrac ted hearings 
over allegations that he violated 
council bylaws. Last year, Watts 
stirred up controversy by airing 
the beheading of an American 
contractor in Iraq on Warren 
College Television. 

When he announced plans to 
show the video again - and sent 
out press releases telling the medja 
- Warren administrators tem-
porarily shut down the station. 
Additionally, Watts served as the 
Opinion editor of the GUII,.diall 
during the 2003-2004 academic 
year and wrote for the newspaper 
during fall and winter quarters of 
2004-2005. 

Currently, Watts serves as the 
interim chair of the College 
Republicans. However, he said his 
national political ideology is not 
related to how he would govern on 
campus. 

"We want what the students 
want, and I don't see what their 
national political affiliation has to 
do with how [candidates) will func-
tion in office any more than their 
religion or sexual orientation ," 
Watts said. 

We want to be beautiful.

Vision: Boddula promises

dent only starts plans, and then 
the counci l goes through the 
process of approving it. T hat's 
something for Kiki to tackle. 
Like me, he 'd be coming in as an 
independent and without any 
ties to slates, which would have 
given him a foundation of people 
to work with." 

hventy of 28 candidates run-
ning to become A.S. senators are 
members of a slate, ensuring a 
large slate presence on the A.S. 
Council next year. Still, Boddula 
emphaSIzes a unifying theme in 
his independent candidacy. 

"I would first try to really gain 
trust from senators," he said. 
"That is hard, but that would be 
it. I'm very open in what I do and 
stand for. I would try to unify the 
different beliefs and slates to con-
struct rather than break apart." 

Boddula's vision for his presi-
dency mirrors Pae's administration, 
in which Pae has strived to create a 
positive working environment. 

"I kept a very positive image of 
A.S. ," she said. "I tried to put 
my elf out there and work togeth-
er. J didn 't want A.S . to bicker and 
argue about the little things." 

Having the A.S. Senate avoid 

debates will require not political 
power but the power to communi-
cate and understand, Boddula said. 

Such understanding spurred 
Boddula's attempt to help an 
underachieving child in the TRJO 
program. The fatherless boy from 
the program was in need of not 
only a mentor but also transporta-
tion from the program, Boddula 
said. With permission from 'the 
boy's mother, Boddula began giv-
ing the child rides home. 
However, administrative policies 
prevented Boddula from helping 
the child beyond tutoring. 

"The boy couldn't make it to 
the tutoring program wi thout a 
ride home, and the kid was heart-
broken," Boddula said. "To me, it 
personally reflects my passion in 
reaching out and wanting to cre-
ate equality and opportunity. It's 
just one kid. He has so much 
potential. It's like society is 
becoming [so] contract-oriented, 
it's lost its humanity." 

It is humanity rather than 
experience that Boddula said he 
would like to bring to student gov-
ernment, and he answered critics 
of his limited political experience 
by emphasizing that "my experi-
ence comes from being a student. " 

continlU?d from page 1 1 
Empowerment! Vice President 
External candidate Kevin MalUl. 

As a result, the slate has the 
fewest candidates of the three 
competing in the election. 

"We pride ourselves in not 
having any 'fluff' candida tes, ". 
Mann stated in an e-mail. "When 
choosing our slate, the coalition 
decided that if there was a better 
candidate running for a certain 
position , we agreed not to run 
someone against them." 

Sweeten's campus poli tical

Action Committee and the chan-
cellor's undergraduate diversity 
counci l. Sweeten sa id he feels t hat

him if he is elected president. 

In addition, Swee ten has orga-

issues are at hand and to never give 
up the fight for student rights." 

Mann agrees that Sweeten is a 
powerful leader in campus politics. 

"Chris is an amazing candidate 
for A.S. President," Mann stated. 
"He is an amazing leader. He is one 
of the most organized people [ 
know. He was able to transform his 
current seat as commissioner of 
diversity from a simple 'token' 
position into a powerful voice 
advocating for students." 

Even with his previous experi-
ence, Sweeten did not plan on 
running for president until 
February, due to family issues. 

"I dec ided to run for president 
because I felt the students deserve 
someone who would not let them 
down," he stated. "Someone who 
would stand up and fight for the 
rights of all students on issues that 
affect the undergraduate popula-
tion, the largest population of stu-
dents on campus." 

Sweeten's goals if elected pres-
ident include increased trans-
parency of Associa ted Students 
and an eventual restructuring of 
the council. Specifically, Sweeten 
plans to hold town hall forums to 
allow student groups and organi-
zations to voice their opinions on 
the new structure of the A.S . 
Council After the forum, Sweeten 
would incorporate student opin-
ions into a recommendation to 
bring before the counci l. 

However, any changes would 
need to be approved by a majori ty 
of the council and his slate has 
only four candidates competing 
for senatorial seats, a small por-
tion of the 24 voting sea ts on the 
council even under the best possi-
ble election outcome. 

"I fee l that the representation 
structure of A.S . needs to be 
looked at because [ feel that in 
order to have effective leaders, we 
shouldn 't stretch the leade.rs on 
campu's thin ," he stated. 

Sweeten also plans to work 
with Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson and 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to 
ensure that the transfer housing 
project, slated for construction in 
2007, becomes a reality. Fin~lly, 
Sweeten also intends to improve 
campus climate. 

"My first step in doing this is to 
urge [the Student Office of Human 
Relations] to run a mandatory sur-
vey of the students on how they feel 
about the campus climate," 
Sweeten stated. "I will work to 
improve how hate [and] bias inci-
dents are being treated throughout 
the university. One of the ways that 
this needs to be addressed is by 
improving how the campus deals 
with rape and sexual harassment on 
campus, which has no set guidelines 
... the university has to follow." 

Generally, Sweeten said he 
hopes for smooth elections this 
year and is confident about run-
ning with the Student 
Empowerment! slate. 

"I feel the elections would run 
smoothly on the basis that 
Student Empowerment' is only 
running on the issues and is in no 
way trying to hinder the other 
slates' ability to run," he stated. 
"We want the students to decide 
who the best candidates for the 
positions are and who would ade-
quately represent them."

relay team, made up of Patton, 
juniors Matt Borzage, Peiman 
Lahsaei and CJ Lawrence, finished 
first, beating second-place Azusa 
Pacific by nearly 0.4 seconds. The 
men's 135.5 point first-place finish 
led the team, to meet the high goals 
it Iud for itself. 

"We've been working really 
hard, and everybody seems much 
more mature and stronger," 
Beeman said. "We're ready to go." 

The women's team towered over 
its com peti tion wi th a total of 222 
points ahead of second-place Azusa 
Pacific with 107. Hodgins took first 
in both the 800 and 1500 races, 
while freshman teammate Dianne 
Dunn took second in the 800. 
Freslunan Laiah Blue won the 400 
hurdles and silvered in the 100 hur-
dles. Blue credits coach Darcy 
Ahner for her successes this season. 

"[Ahner] immediately saw the 
things that needed to be fixed, and 
that's shown in my races," Blue said. 

Freshman Whitney Johnson and 
sophomore Elisa Holiday finished 
one-two in the women's long jump, 
posting 5.65 meters and 5.37 
meters, respectively. 

The SDSU Aztec Invitational on 
March 21 was also a success for the 
Tritons. For the women, senior 
Kendra Canape tied for first place 
in the high jump with a mark of 5 -7. 
The plalUled jump-off to determine 
first place between Canape and 
Aztec Nicole Carnier was canceled 
because of inclement weather. 
Holiday took second place in the 
long jump with a jump of 18-7 3/4 
- the third-best jump in Triton his-
tory and only one-quarter of an inch 
off an NCAA provisional mark. For

Women's tennis drops' 
two consecutive matches 

By EVAN WANG 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team, after starting the season with 
10 straight wins, suffered irs first 
two losses of the season against 
Barry University in an 8-1 deficit 
and the University of West Florida 
in a 9-0 shutout during the Triton 
Spring Break Challenge, bringing 
thei r season record to 10-2 . 

"We played both matches welJ," 
head coach Liz LaPlante said. "It's 
just a whole different level. At the 
top of Division II tennis, you see a 
lot of international players on full· 
ride schol arships. It's a whole dif-
ferent caliber of tennis." 

On March 25, the Tritons host-
ed Barry University (J 2-2), ranked 
No. 6 in the nation. The 
Buccaneers came out all business, 
and got an early jump on the 
Tritons in doubles play, taking two 
of the three matchups. Juniors 
Kristin Bronowicki and Katie 
McKee came up with the only 
UCSD victory on the day at the 
No. 2 spot, defeating Barry'S Ana 
Maria Zuleta and Helen 
Wisniewski, 9-7. Sophomore 
Marsha Malinow and junior Tara 
Siddiqui lost, 3-8, at the No.1 spot, 
and senior team captain Jasmin 
Dao and junior Marissa Hilker fell 
at the No. 3 spot by the same score. 

On the singles side, Barry 
University swept the field. McKee 
came the closest to victory, taking 
the Bucs' Kristin Danielson to a 
third set at the No. 5 spot before 
ultimately falling, 7-6, 2-6, 4-10. 
Malinow, Dao, Hilker, Siddiqui 
and junior Leigh Roberts all fell in 
straight sers. 

"We don 't thinle it's a bad thing 
[to lose)," Dao said. "We'd rather 
have tough matches and lose th.an 
just cruise through the entire sea-
son. When we have tough compe· 
tition, it malces us more prepared 
to compete when it really counts." 

Two days prior, on March 23, 
the Tritons matched up against their 
highest-ranked opponent of the sea-

son, University of West Florida (14· 
2), currently No.3 in the nation. 

The Argonauts quickly showed 
that they were deserving of their 
ranlcing, jumping out to a 3 -0 lead 
after taking all three doubles 
matches. Malinow and Siddiqui 
fell, 3-8, Bronowiclci and McKee, 
5-8, and Dao and Hilker, 4-8. 

In singles play, the Tritons bat-
tled valiantly, talcing four of the six 
matches to third sets. UCSD play· 
ers won the first set in each of those 
four matches, but could not main-
tain the momentum to pull out vic-
tories against the West Florida play-
ers. Malinow (6-2, 4·6, 7-10), Dao 
(0-6,6-3 ,6-2), McKee (4-6,6-3, 10-
4) and Roberts (6-7, 6-3, 10-5) each 
fell in three sets; Hilker (6- 1, 6-4) 
and Siddiqui (6-4, 7 -5) fell in two. 

"All of us fought to the very end, 
and that shows we can compete 
with them," Dao said. "The match-
es were very close and very long, so 
they were definitely closer than the 
[9-0) score indicated. We learned 
what we need to improve on." 

Prior to finals week, the team 
played a grueling stretch of three 
home matches in three days, testing 
tile players' stamina. They passed 
with flying colors, emerging victo-
rious against Cal State Bakersfield 
(9-0) on March 12, against Cal 
State San Bernardino (8- 1) on 
March 11 and against University of 
San Francisco (7-2) on March 10. 
University of San Francisco was the 
second Division I opponent the 
Tritons downed this year. UCSD 
remains undefeated in conference 
play against California Collegiate 
Athletic Association opponents. 

"Everybody's going to get 
tougher from here, and we're real-
ly looking forward to the upcoming 
matches," Dao said. "If we contin-
ue to improve, we'" peak at the 
right time." 

T he team returns to action 
March 31, hosting Williams 
College at 2 p.m. at the Northview 
Courts. The following day, the 
Tritons will head north for the Cal 
Poly Pomona Tournament.

champion, rival Ohio State, on the 
last day of competition. These 
efforts were bolstered by the 
Fighting Irish 's large number of 
competi tors at the Championshjps. 

All four UCSD fencers missed 
out on A11·American status, desig-
nated for the top 12 placers in each 
of the six evenrs (men's epee, foil 
and sabre for both men and 
women). 

As the collegiate fencing season 
comes to a close, the fe ncers 

already have their sights set on next 
year. While many will continue to 
compete and train with private 
teams and coaches during the off· 
season, their minds will certainly be 
with the team. . 

"I feel like I've accomplished a 
good amount, and I hope that I 
don't feel too much pressure next 
season," Martin said. "I just want to 
enjoy my last year with the team. I 
love the sport and am having more 
fun with it and enjoying it more all 
the time."

three, 32-30. 

The Tritons were now in an 
unusual situation : They had an 
opportunity to ",in the match and 
the momentum was in their favor. 
However, the team couldn't capi-
talize on its opportuni ty and 
allowed Cal Baptist to tie the 
match. T he score was tied nine 
times in the game until the Lancers 
took the first sizable lead, 22- 19. 
They extended the lead to five with 
a 6-4 run and then pulled away to 
win the game, 30-25, to force a 
fifth game. 

The Tritons had faced this scene 
twice before in the year, against UC 
Santa Barbara and UC Irvine; in 
those matches the Tritons fai led to 
deliver victories. This time was dif-
ferent, however, as the Tritons rose 
to the occasion and managed to 
come back to win the game and the 
match. Down 8-5 and with the spir-
it of a team with nothing to lose, the 
Tritons rattled off three straight 
points to tie it up. The score would 

be even four more times before a 
Triton lcill and a Lancer error led to 
a 17-15 win in game five and a 3-2 
victory in the match. 

Senior outside hitter Luke 
Honnette led the victorious Tritons 
with 21 lcills, and UCSD outhit the 
Lancers, .309-.289. However, the 
kill stars do not mean as much as the 
stat of one in the win column. The 
Tritons ended the losing streak and 
were on their way to starting a new 
one - a winning streak. 

Unfortunately, the streak was 
short-lived, as the Tritons have 
gone 0-3 since the win with a loss 
to Long Beach State and two to 
Hawaii. Despite their .050 win-
ning percentage so far, the Tritons 
have that one win, and even if it is 
their last, it will be the one that 
counts. 

The Tritons will have a chance 
to double their win count March 30 
against USC and possibly even 
triple it with a win over Pepperdine 
on April 2. Both games wi ll be at 
RIMAC Arena. 

Fan: Spring training is as 
much a pasttime as the season 

continu£d from page :10 
Granted, some good teams do per-
form weU in spring training and 
some bad teams play down to their 
Qack of) talent. But it's basically 
impossible to separate the real con-
tenders from the pretenders. That's 
why they play 162 games during the 
regular season, after aU. 

Some things never change 
though: the crack of the bat, the pop 
of the glove, the ridiculously over-
priced ballpark concessions. Good 
thing I'm not 21, or I'd have been 

tempted to pay $6 for a Bud Light. 
And that's not to say that going to 

the games wasn't awesome. When 
else will you have the opportunity to 
chat up Hall of Fame reporter Peter 
Gammons during an Ns-Rangers 
game or sit four rows behind home 
plate and watch Bany Zito pitch for 
$20 bucks? When else will you be 
able to get the autographs of 
Oakland's next Big Three of Rich 
Harden, Joe Blamon and Dan 
Meyer all at once? For any real base-
ball fan, there is nothing better.

Track and field topple records 
Tritons surge through four meets defiantly 

By JESSICA NAGER 
Staff Writer 

The UC 0 track and field 
tea ms have been busy with their 
own version of March Madness, 
competing in four meets in as 
many weeks. Both teams have 
dominated other schools, includ-
ing San Diego State and USc. 
Individua lly, senior Kevin Beeman 
and junior Mimi Hodgins broke 
chool records in the men's high 

jump and. the women's SOO-meter 
race, respectively, while junior Jon 
Patton tied the school record in 
the 200 dash. 

At the March 25 and March 26 
Collegia te Open ho ted by 
UCSD, both teams finished in 
first place. The men's team, which 
was in eighth place at the end of 
the first of the two-day competi-
tion, rocketed ahead and finished 
fi rst out of IS teaDlS. Beeman set 
the new chool record in the high 
jump with a jump of six feet, II 
inche , which broke the old record 
of 6-1 0 and met the NCAA provi-
sional mark in the event. 

"It was g od to break the 
record at horne," Beeman said. "It 
wa a nice relief because it's some-
thing I've been clo e to all season." 

Junior Mike Cunningham won 
the 400-meter hurdles with a time 
of 52 .S4. Junior Carl Lostrom fin-
ished first in the 1500 race with a 
time of 3:57.59 - just a little more

Spring training is fun, but 
don't read too much into it 

The 
Thinking Fa 

Bryan Tsao 

A h, spring. T hat time of year when our brackets are bust-ed, the NBA season seems 
like it will never end and ice hock-
ey rinks across the nation are -
nevermind. But most importantly, 
it means that Major League 
Baseball's annual spring training is 
here, and that just as one lucky 
team is cutting down the nets in St. 
Louis, baseball wiU arrive to divert 
our attention from lesser matters, 
like school and girlfriends. 

T his year, 1 celebrated by meet-
ing up with an old buddy from high 
school and driving down to Arizona 
to get a piece of the action for 
myself. About $500 and 390 miles 
later, we were at Phoenix Municipal 
Stadium, spring training home of 
the Oakland Athletic - the official 
team of the Thinking Fan - with 
hot dogs in hand and ready to take 
in our first game, the Oakland Ns 
versus the San Francisco Giants. As 
the PA announced the lineups, we 
realized that we had struck gold: 
The starrers for the game were to 
be Oakland's Barry Zito and the 
Giants' Jason Schmidt. The sold-
out stadium buzzed in anticipation 
of a classic spring training pitching 
duel matching Schmidt's humming 

heater and Zito's dancing curveball. 
Of course, Schmidt came out in 

the top of the first aod promptly gave 
up four runs with nary a single out, 
including a monstrous three-run 
blast by Oakland third baseman Eric 
Chavez. Zito, on the other .hand, 
pitched magnificently, spotting his 
curve for strikes and fooling batters 
with his change-up. (Note to self: 
Try to get Barry Zito on my fantasy 
team.) After being pummeled for 10 
runs, nine hits and three homers in 
less than four innings, Schmidt was 
done and the Ns had delivered an 
impressive win just in time for to 
see it. (Note to self: Don't draft 
Schmidt in the first round.) 

Of course, it is still spring and the 
games don't really matter yet. 
Batters are trying to get their timing 
back and pitchers are sharpening up. 
Between that and the fact that half 
the players are rookies or scrubs with 
no chance of making the Major 
League roster, spring training stats 
and records need to be taken with a 
grain of salt the size of Barry Bonds' 
head. Look no further than last year, 
when the Seattle Mariners dominat-
ed the Cactus League with a league-
best IS- II record, narrowly beating 
out the Milwaukee Brewers, who 
went IS- 12. The two teanlS then 
combined to finish 66.5 games out of 
first place. Last year, the Los Angeles 
Dodgers left Ariwna with a pathetic 
12-2 1 record. But when the games 
really counted, they tallied 93 wins, 
good enough for a division title.

Fencing reaches 18th at 
NCAA Championships 

Men's volleyball wins first match 
Runyan, Sprowles, Ambort and Martin 
face intense competition at Nationals 

By EVAN WANG 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD fencing sent four of its 
brightest young stars to the NCAA 
C hampionships in Houston, Texas, 
from March 17 to March 20. They 
returned home as leaders of the 
ISth-ranked fencing program in 
the United States. 

Freshmen Jason Runyan, 
Cameron Sprowles and Chelsea 
Ambort and junior Bret Martin 
repre ented the Tritons on colle-
giate fencing's gra ndest stage. 
Competing in fields of 24, the 
Tritons were up against the top 
competition the nation had to offer, 
including a number of O lympians. 

Runyan and Martin competed 
in the men's sabre event, Sprowles 
in the men's foil and Ambort in the 
women's epee. This was Martin's 
second visit to Nationals, and the 
other fencers' first. 

"1 loved [the experience)," 
Martin said. "I loved it last time, 
and I enjoyed it just as much this 
time. The experience wasn 't as new 
this time, but it was different 
because I had teammates with me." 

The tournament was in a 
round-robin format. Each fencer 
went against the other 23 fencers in 
his or her field in a series of five-
touch bouts spread over two days. 
After the completion of the round-
robin bouts, the top four fini hers 
fenced one another in fifteen-touch 
bouts to determine the placing for 
the top finishers. 

"The great thing about this 
tournament was that you are able 
to go up against every other c :>m-
petitor in the tournament, " Run}'2n 

said. "Whereas at another tourna-
ment you may only go up against 
eight other fencers, Nationals pro-
vides a great way to gain experience 
against a lot of great fencers. You 
learn a ton." 

Martin made good on his 
promise to improve on his perfor-
mance last year, where he picked up 
five victories en route to a 19th -
place finish. This year, he picked up 
seven victories - though in the 
overall standings he once again 
placed 19th. 

"I got off to a slow stan, going O-
lion the first day," Martin said. 
"But on the second day, I went 7-5. 1 
wish 1 had come out and fenced like 
that from the start. Even though 
some of the competition was 
tougher on the first day, I think I 
could have taken a few more bouts." 

Martin's fellow sabreur, 
Runyan, finished with four victo-
ries and a Brd-place finish . 

"With so many bouts, it was 
hard to fence at my best for aU 23," 
Runyan said. "[ fenced better dur-
ing some bouts than others. It 
changed a lot over the course of 
two days." 

Sprowles managed three victories 
in the tournament, and placed 23rd 
overall among the men's foilists. 

UCSD's lone female representa-
tive, Ambort, scored the most points 
for UCSD, winning nine bouts on 
her way to a 19th-place finish . 

The combined effort of the 
Triton fencers led to an ISth-place 
team finish for UCSD. Notre 
Dame took the top overall team 
award, squeaking by last year 's

Tritons break II-month losing streak versus Cal Baptist 
By RAIL ENTEEN 

Staff Writer 
T he UCSD men's voUeyball 

team has won a game. With a win 
more spectacular than the Red 
Sox's victory in Game 7, the 
Tritons ended a 19-9ame skid dat-
ing back to last April and 
improved upon a season that was 
heading nowhere. 

A playoff berth impossible, the 
only thing on the line when the 
Tritons arrived in Riverside on 
March 9 to play Cal Baptist was 
pride. Facing an 0-16 record in 
the 2005 season, the Tritons were 
overdue for a win. T he Lancer 
are a quality team with a winning 
record, and the Tritons had yet to 
prove themselves, so a win was far 
from expected. However, UCSD 
pulled away with the upset in a 3-
2 victory (3 0-26, 27-30,32-30,25-
30, 17- 15). 

T he Lancers dominated the 
Tritons in thei r first match of the 
season, beating them in straight 
sets back on Jan. S. At that point 
the losing streak was only at four 
games, but two months later it 
appeared that it could last forever. 
However, the rematch between 
the Lancers and the Tritons 
proved to be much more exciting 
than the first meeting, as the 
squads exchanged points for five 
games unti l the Tritons finally 
cemented their victory. 

T he first game starred with a 
3-2 Lancer lead before the Tritons 
took advantage of numerous Cal 
Baptist errors to go on a 10-1 run. 
The Tritons managed to keep the 
Lancers at bay and maintained 
their lead to win the first game, 
30-26. 

The Tritons led 1-0 twice ea.r-
Iier in the season against UC 

Santa Barbara and Penn State; 
however, those leads did not last 
and the games ended in hearr-
break. Heading into game two, 
the Tritons were looking to repeat 
their success from game one and 
put the Lancers on the brink of 
defeat. Unfortunately, Cal Baptist 
put in most of its starters for the 
second game, which it did not do 
in game one, and that made the 
difference as the Lancers jumped 
out to a 13-7 lead and then a 17-
11 advantage. The Tritons showed 
that they could hang with the big 
boys when they charged back to 

come within one point of their 
opponents, 21-20. However, the 
Tritons failed in their attempt and 
the Lancers carne away with a 30-
27 win to tie the match at one 
game apiece. 

In a decisive third game, the 
Tritons fell behind once again, at 
21-15. The Lancers could not 
hold off a surging Triton team, 
which tied the score at 2S-2S. T he 
squads exchanged points until 
UCSD managed to put back-to-
back points together to win game
