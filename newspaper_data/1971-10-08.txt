New resident dean at Muir 
Works for harmony in dorms 

Kathy K/uzelc 

Cleo Malone bemoans the fact that " universities are often 
more concerned with learning how to make a living rather than 
learning how to live." So, the new Muir Resident Dean 
attempts to help students face up to the problems inherent in 
community living. He sees his role as that of a buffer between 
the students and the administration. 

Malone's long-range goal for Muir college is simply for its 
residents to live together in harmony. He feels college dorms 
are a microcosm of any residential community, so this 
apparently simple goal takes on more profound implications. 

The lack of communication between Blacks and whites was a 
problem at Muir last year, Malone believes. Neither group was 
able to sit down and confront the other with what was on their 
minds. Consequently, there was much frustration which 
Manifested itself in petty accusations and complaints. 

He goes on to state that this lack of communication is not 
only found between Blacks and whites, but between roommates 
and suitemates as well . 

.. I get people coming up here all the time telling me they 
can't get along with their roommate. My reaction is, 'bull shit' . 
If they can't even try to get along with their roommate or 
Suitemates, what are they going to do with the bitch that lives 
down the hall from them a couple of years from now?" he said. 

Malone's more immediate goals for Muir college include 
plans for a student-operated coffee house and a crisis center. 

The crisis center, located in Muir apartment number K-2, is 
already open. The staff has gone through rigorous training 
under Malone, who has had much previous experience as a 
drug counseloor. Soon, the center will have four phones 
available to serve students; three outside lines and one campus 
line. 

Along with Muir Dean of Students Jim Beckley, Malone plans 
to open a coffee house in the Muir commons within a couple of 
weeks. A student director, Harvey Hoff, has been selected to 
arrange for poetry readings and folk Singers to perform 
nightly . 

"The important thing is to get the coffee house running," 
said Malone. "As various needs arise, they will be dealt with ." 

One snag he has encountered with his proposal is the 
possibility of a conflict between the food services and the 
coffee house. To avoid this, the coffee house will only serve hot 
and cold drinks, leaving students with the option of going 
upstairs to the cafeteria for more substantial food . 

In addition to his experiences with drug counselling, Malone 
has been a state-wide director for the state of Ohio. He was 
also a member of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference under Dr. Martin Luther King. He no longer 
believes non-violence is the answer , but neither does he 
advocate rampant destruction. 

" I believe that we as Black Americans shouldn't have to 
fight for the rights that should be ours naturally ... Why do the 

CIeoMaloDe 

Blacks have to have a special document, the Civil Rights act, 
to give them their due?" he said. " Why can't we get our rights 
on the same piece of paper as everyone else, the Constitu tion of 
the United States of America ?" 

Malone invites anyone who has housing troubles, or who just 
wants to rap, to come up to th 11th floor of Tioga or into his 
office in the Muir apartments to see him.

City 
Long years of student unrest, 

it is said, irreparably damaged 
the political clout of the 
University of California. But in 
San Diego, at least. this doesn 't 
seem to be true. Over the 
summer the city council and 
city planning ' commission 
approved without significant 
change a master development 
plan for the underdeveloped 
land just east of campus that 
gives the UniverSity, in effect. 
exactly what it asked for . What 
is more, the city has done this 
in the face of stiff opposition 
from the building interests that 
own the land. 

" If we are able to translate 
just 10 per cent of this plan into 
reality." said one planner. 
" we'll have a model university 
communitv." . 

This optimism seems well 
founded at this point. 
Subsidized student apartments. 
diverse small shops and 
"speakeasies ." and an 
interlacing system of bikeways 
are dominant features of the 
projected 90.000 resiclent 
"universitv communitv." 

The central and distinctive 
element of the new township is 
the concept of the town core. a 
compact area where "activity 
s hould be varied and 
concentrated . pedestrian 
oriented. and continuouslv 
alive." To insure this. the plan 
provides for numerous low-cost 
commercial and entertainment 
establishments. wide sidewalks 
and greens. and a mix of 
residential and commercial 
uses within the same buildings. 
The township should be

University of California , San Diego ~d,=, Tblueiff)' October ,1971 

OK's 'Model Community' 
With all of this. the 

University has no complaints. 
But the happy outcome was not 
an accident. Owners of the 
undeveloped land behind 
campus had originally wanted 
to build a regional shopping 
center on the model of Fashion 
and Mission Valley. and a 
complement of housing tracts . 
After that proposal was 
defeated. the owners still 
wanted to build a community 
that would cater to a wealthier 
clientele than the University 
affords - in other words, they 
wanted another Westwood. 

UCSD. on the other hand. 
wanted a community more 
along the lines of Cambridge 
(adjacent to Harvard 
Universitv I. A University-
oriented community with low-
cost cultural. commercial. and 
housing units at the center. and 
the more exclusive housing on 
the fringes . 

Despite the fact that land 
owners stand to realize 
distinctly lower profits on a 
university community than 
they would on a regional 
shopping center of a Westwood 
type community. the 
University. so far . has won out. 

The kev to this success 
seems to iie in two points : 1 I 
the commitment of an 
enlightened city government to 
helping UCSD achieve 
distinction : and 21 the 
diligence of the UCS£)' 
administration in making its 
position known. 

The story begins in 1958 when 
UCSD was still on the drawing 
boards. In an effort to persuade 
the Universitv of California 
Regents to locate a general 
campus- at San Diego rather 
than at one of several other 
sites they were considering. 
the San Diego city council sent 
the Regents a telegram that 
promised to " prepare the new 
master plan of the areas 
adjacent to the proposed La 
Jolla site of the new Universit~' 
of California. including a 
compatible land use plan and a 
local highway system to 
adequatel~' serve the proposed 
Univenit\· and its environs ... 

At the time, UCSD was 
forneen as limply a small 

engineering college (La Jolla 
citizens would have opposed 
anything that sounded even 
remotely like 10-20,000 
students l. and the city 
council's promise could have 
turned out to be a mere 
formality . But as UCSD 's 
projected size increased to 
Tl.500 in the early sixties, San 
Diego also increased its 
commitment. The University 
and the city came to an 
informal agreement whereby 
the city wouldn 't approve any 
development that UCSD didn't 
feel it could live with. 

In practice, this has meant 
that potential developers have 
negotiated directly with the 
University for its approval 
before taking their proposals to 
the planning commission. 

But in the first important 
proposal for developing land 
east of campus. the University 
didn 't pay close attention. The 
result was a plan that "would 
have been a disaster ." 
according to one UCSD official. 
and although it has since been 
amended considerably at the 

insistence of the University, it 
still isn 't what the University 
wanted. 

Under Chancellors William 
McGill and Herbert York , 
these lapses did not occur. 
When the city announced its 
intention to revise an earlier 
master plan in Feb. 1969, an ad 
hoc committee was 
immediately formed on 
campus . It produced a 
preliminary report that 
became the base for the first 
draft of the new master plan'. 
Later, after off-campus 
interests changed some of the 
original working. the ad hoc 
committee, under the 
c ha irmanship of Vice -
Chancellor of Business . and 
Finance Herman Johnson. 
suggested 150 specific changes. 
almost all of which were 
incorporated into a redraft. 

But until the master plan was 
given final approval by the city 
council on Sept. 23. the 
outcome was always in doubt. 
Controversy between 
developers and the University 
focu sed mainly on two 

"We 're 36 years behind" 

questions . First. the University 
wanted incorporation of 
language requiring a certain 
proportion of low-priced 
student housing, whereas 
developing interests , 
apparently hoping to build 
more expensive and thus more 
profitable housing, preferred 
that language be left weak or 
vague. Second, the University 
wanted the proposed township 
to grow at about the same pace 
as the campus , whil e 
developers wanted freedom to 
build as fast as plans and 
financing could be brought 
together . 

The University regarded both 
issues, and particularly the 
second, as critical. " Let's face 
it," explained Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs George 
Murphy, " if developers build 
up a community overnight. 
they 're not going to plan on 
letting it stand empty until the 
University expands enough to 
fill it. " Instead, he said. 
developers would tend to build 
in ' ways incompatible with the 

i d ea of a un ive r SIty 
community. 

The developers argued that 
havjng made large capital 
outlay in the land . the are 
entitled to build the kind of 
communil necessary to insure 
a reasonable return on their 
investment. 

As of last spring, the 
University was not wholly 
confident that its influence 
would prevail. With the 
economy slow and the S;.r 
Diego naval base culling back, 
it was felt that the city would 
not do anything to discourage 
developers from proceeding as 
fast as financing could be 
secured. 

But the University won on 
both major points in hearings 
before the Plann i ng 
Commission and the city 
council. "Portion of low-cost 
student housing" became "a 
significant portion of student 
housing : " and the language 
restricting growth rate was left 
unchanged.

Wilson competition off 
This fall . for the fi rst time in more than 20 years. there will 

be no Woodrow Wil on Fellowship competition. Among college 
professors. and those college seniors who are considering 
becoming professors. this compet ition has become as much a 
part of the fall term as football . 

H. Ronald Rouse. ational Director of the Woodrow Wilson 
ational Fellowship Foundation. said. "Funds currently 

available to the Foundation for first year graduate fe llowships 
are bei ng used to support over 200 fe llows during the 1971-72

Woodrow 'Ilwn Fellows. 

The Wrlson Fellowships are only one of a number of 
programs throughout the country which have suffered from the 
recent decline in fellowship support. Mr. Rouse said. The U.S. 
government . which in 1967 supported nearly 11.000 fellowships 
for beginning graduate students. has reduced or eliminated 
several programs. It will provide only about 1.500 new 
fellowships for 1972·73. At the same time many state 
governments and private foundations have similarly reduced 
the amount of support they provide.

compliments it. and a truly 
di stinguished university is of 
more long run value to San 
Diego than the immediate 
profits of allowing developers 
to build haphazardly. 

The Univers ity had the 
general support of the San

a group which has for several 
yea rs been working to develop 
an ou tsta nding bio-medical 
com plex in connection with the

detrimental to this hope as it 
would have been to the idea of a 
University community, and the

Nevertheless. and despite

Faculty Pay 
Raise Imperative! 

" 

Sometime today or Monday, State Senate Bill 101 
will reach the Assembly floor for a most crucial 
vote. If approved by the necessary two·thirds 
margin, faculty members of the University of 
California and the State Colleges might receive a 
long overdue salary increase of 7112 per cent. 

The consequences of two years without faculty 
salary increases are obvious to all of us . 
Departments cannot attract good people, and 
chairmen and deans are finding it hard to keep 
their present faculty. It is also obvious that 
Governor Reagan 's motives in denying a pay raise 
earl ier this year were as much political as they 
were punit ive the year before. 

What may not be so obvious is the power the 
University community has in th is crucial vote. 
Two of the assemblymen who are as yet undecided 
and whose votes are critical to approval are 
Assemblyman Pete Wilson of San Diego and 
Assemblyman John Stull of Leucadia. Mr. Stull, 
along with his constituency, has come to feel that 
the faculty is long overdue for a salary increase. 
Mr . Wi lson's current mayorality campaign has 
been aimed in large measure toward the student 
vote, and thus he must be most receptive to 
University sentiment . Both men must be deluged 
with letters, telephone calls and telegrams. If the 
University communi ty does not speak out strongly 
in support of its faculty, there is no reason to 
expect the State Legislature to do so.

Is Population 
Control the Answer? 

opyrighl 1971 
~ationa l Black Science 

tudents Organiza tion 

by: P.R. imms 

While Jim Sills pointed out 
last week that Pau l Erhlich isa 
man to be watched by all 
people because of his plans to 
"disenfranchise all persons 
over 65" and " calls for 
chemicals in the water 
supply ,- ' Black people , 
especially students_ should also 
be carefully examining this 
" new crisis" of a veiled 
depopu lation plan in the Black 
community. 

Some claim that these cries 
of "genocide" are ridiculous. 
but most Jews, ei ther from 
primary or secondary 
experience. will tell you that 
Auschwitz was far from 
ridiculous - at least if ~'ou 
were inside . 

Ye . there are dangers in this 
population control fad! For 
example. Dr. Irving Spencer. 
writing in the 1970 edition of the 
World Almanac on medical 
developments during the 
previous year, stated that the 
world 's greatest public health 
problem was not malnutrition 
or disease , but over -
population. Spencer mentioned 
experiments being currently 
performed at Rockefeller 
University by ,Dr. Kenneth 
Laurence as a possible 
solution, Laurence is working 
on a process known as 
immunological sterilization -
which neutralizes I terminates I 
reproduction b~' making the 
egg chemicall~' unable to 
receive sperm, Commenting on 
these method of "birth 
contro1. " Spencer noted : 

once applied to 
humans. I immunological 
sterilization I could be 
employed in uneducated , 
overpopu la ted. under· 
developed countries. as well 
as in countries enjoying a 
high level of education, 
Since voluntarv birth 
control appears 'to be a 
forlorn hope, this new 
immunologic approach 
reported by Laurence 
foreca s t s a major 
development in birth 
contro1. " 

When Spencer says that 
voluntary birth control is a 
" forlorn' hope." he is also 
saying that other methods of 
controlling births must be 
found - methods which are not 
voluntary - like pUlling 
something in drinking water, 
Thus. it is conceivable that 
men and or women will ei ther 
be forced to submit to this type 
of teriliza tion or it will be 
introduced without their 
knowledge , But other que tions 
are : "Will this be a random 
selection 'Of people to be 
sterilized. or will only selected 
people lor peoples I be 
subjected to this type of 
treaunent? ": "What does 
Spencer really mean when he 
savs ' un edu ca ted , 
overpopulated . underdeveloped 
countries' and 'as well as in 
countries which enjoy a high 
level of education '?" 

Erlich says that Lhe major 
problem is among the affluent 
white Americans - that 
because they have more . they 
pollutemore - and this is the 
group that Erlich supposedly 
wants to work on wi th his 
population experiments. But 
we know that Black and Puerto 
Rican women were receiving 
birth control pills from clinics 
in 'ew York and in Puerto 
Rico long before they were 
introduced on the market to the 
public. Moreover. it was in the 
Moynihan report. back in the 
mid 1960' s, which tipped us off 
that we had better watch what 
is going on in the area of 
population control. when he 
described the situation here in 
the U.S. as .. acute" because of 
" the extraordinarv rise of the 
Negro population:" <In 19".0. 
Black people were 9,9 percent 
of the population : today 
approximately I~ , O 
percent????? I. 

So when we saw the 
Moynihan Report in 1966. we 
knew that this was not the last 
we would hear about over -
population . It was the First ' 

~ational Congress on Optimum 
Population and Environment 
held in Chicago. Illinois on June 
i-II. 1970 that the real program 
began to make itself evident. 
You see, not on lv Erlich. 
Spencer and Laur'ence are

talKi ng about massive 
sterilization through water or 
other method cau ing no 
ala rm . but others like Jon D. 
Roland - from whose paper. 
presented at the Congress. I 
take some quotes: 

"One possible solution 
would be a sterilizing 
chemical or disease that 
would onlv effect humans 
and that could be inexpen-
sh'ely and rapidl y dissemi-
nated to millions of people. 
A disease might be ideal if it 
were highly contagious and 
attacked children, so that 
the symptoms of sterility 
would not appear [or many 
vears after the attack, A di-
Sease is impersonal and 
impartial. A chemical would 
require a deliberate area 
application that might start 
a war . The only way a 
chemical could be used 
would be if it were obsteo· 
sibly applied for another 
purpose, such as for a 
pesticide, and the symptoms 
o[ sterility did not appear 
for many years. 

.. Another possi bility 
would be a chemical or 
disease that did not sterilize 
but only reduced drasticallv 
the number of fema les boni , 
This would be almost as 

effective in the long run . • _ 
il would probably be mach 
more acceptable to the 
target popalation.' · 

Roland Suggesls 
'Effec tive Seleclion' 

Now this is quite clear, The 
only question that could be 
asked is. " who is the target 
population?" As I said, Erlich 
would have us think it is the 
rich whites. But we are notlha t 
politically naive. Roland come 
right out with it : 

"There would still be a 
problem of deciding whe 
would have the children , 
This could be decided bv 

lotter~' or through screening 
tests for intelligence and 
health . With effective 
selection , the new 
generation might not only 
inherit a world worth living 
in. but the physical and 
mental capacity to keep it 
that way, " 

Now you might say. "Well. 
Roland does mention lotterv : 
Blacks couldn' t have anything 
to fear in that'" Except that in 
the next sentence. he talks 
about "effective selection ," 
whi ch means he threw 
"lottery" in the previous 
sentence to throw some people 
off - to keep them in 
ignorance, The definition of 
lotterv. in its esse nce . 
elminates effective selection ! !

Before leaving this point. 
Roland does make one last 
sta tement worth noting here 
{this quote immediately 
follows the above paragraph 
taken from hiS paper I: 
"To achieve this. people 
must be persuaded that they 
not onl v do not have the 
right to' choose the number 
of children they will have. 
but that they do' not have the 
right to have any children at 
all, They might also be 
persuaded that only the 
gifted should have children, 
not as a privilege for them 
but as a duty to ociety. 

It should be clear that when 
the society rpfuses to educate 
the majority of Black people , 
that it is Black people who will 
immediaLelv fall into the 
"uneducated class." Because 
of the two health care sYstems 
in this country - one for the 
rich and one ' for the rest -
Black_ Chicano and poor whites 
I in that order I will be 
classified " unhealthy" and 
"unfit to have children', " 

Worjes of Jensen and 
Schockley Important 

And this is where all of 
Arthur Jensen ' s work and 
William Schock ley ' s work 
become so vitally important to 
Black and Chicano people. If 
thev can convince the 
governments of the world that 
Black people and descendants 
of Black people are genetically 

and inherently inferior to their 
white coun\erparts. thi s will 
open the door for all ki nds of 
plagues - Black plagues. if you 
will - into the Black and other 
minority communities. 

Jensen's work has already 
been quoted in the Congress. 
Welfare mothers. who were 
given hysterectomy operations 
I surgical removal of the 
uteru l. i1l egall ~' in Bo ton are 
now receiving them by law in 
othe r states. Wh at ha 
happened is that Black people 
are stili suffering under the 
same kind of raci m from the 
health care svstem. but its 
bei ng lega lized b ~' th e 
government. 

So. I suggest that all the long 
- haired white who are 
working with ZPG {Zero 
Population Growth I had better 
stop and read what they are 
handing out to the Black 
communi tv. and think about it 
- what kind of society will 
provide famil y planning 
services before treating those 
who are alreadv here? Familv 
planning centers are opening 
throughout Harlem and Bed-
Stuy as if the people never get 
sick and never need medical 
attention - when in fact. 
people are dying in waiting 
rooms, 

And when the "uneducated" 
are no longer a problem. the 
long hairs had better keep 
some scissors and some hair oil 
handy - for if we go, you are 
sure to follow! ! !

Carol Rosenberger. concert 
pianist. ·is a mixture of artist 
and heroine. She has been on 
the concert circuit since 1964. 
but her actual beginnings go 
back to 1955. when her career 
was interrupted by an attack of 
polio. Undaunted. she tudied 
theory while totlll1y unable to 
move. Then. when well enough 
to undergo therapy. she started 
year of re-Iearning the piano 
against almost in urmountable 
odds. Today. she is a virtuoso. 
and a beautifulladv. 

Rosenberger Concert bounds of a classical performance. and was performed wi th great flourish . The second half of the 
program was devoted to 
Chopin : %4 Preludes. Opus 28. 
The Preludes ranged from the 
pedal-toned and gentle to the 
sharply modernistic composed 
in tension-creating suspensions 
and incredible modu lation . The 
pieces ranged from th 
famil iar to the obscure: the 
origins of many of Chopin' s 
well-known later works were 
evident in the Preludes 
material. 

Rowrla Au/rod 

tonally ; inclusion of trills and 
other ornamentation. and the 
u e of fugal style in the third 
movement. 

Miss Rosenberger played to a 
half-full house. but the 
performance did not uffer in 
the lea st. Her first piece. 
Sonata for Piano, 1922 Bv 
Stravinskv. was a modern 
atonal work aurally . but 
contained many suggestions of 
Baroque compositional style 
through other means: e.g" 
baroque style modulatory 
movement sugge s ted 
rhythmically instead of 

Her second piece was 131h 
Nocturne , Opus 119, by Faure. 
This composition was atonal as 
well. but seemed closer to 
tonality becau of its gentle. 
para-Romantic style . The piece 
wa not entirely Without power 
however; Faure alternates his 
slow. moody chordal changes 
with sharp. fast cadenzas. 
creating an intense excitement 
a t the close. 

In contrast. Miss 
Rosenberger next performed a 
smooth. harp-like piece by 
Ravel : Ondine. The piece was 
like a waterfall - containing 
long . pedaled arp eggios

Bergman's religious "Through A Glass Darkly" describes 24 
hours in the life of a fami ly on an isolated island. Considered 
one of the most powerful of Bergman's creations (and winner 
of the 1961 Academy Award for Best 'Foreign Film 1. the film 
combines the ma sterful performances of Harriet Anderssen . 
Gunnar Bjornstrand , Max Von Sydow, and Lars Passgrad with 
a deeply personal touch. 

With this film Bergman initiates the viewers into a 'new 
phase of his film mak ing. After the elaborate visual effects of 
"The Seventh Seal" and " Wild Strawberries." Bergman lays 
bare every flaw in one 's personality with magnificent self-
discipline and self-critical intelligence. It begins a period in 
which the artist moves towards a total exposure of himself to 
reality . To view the trilogy ("Winter Light" and "The Si lence" 
will be shown on the next two consecutive Saturdays) is to 
witness one of the most fascinating confessions ever expressed 
in cinema. 

Appearing with "Through A Glass Darkly" is " Major 
Barbara." With some intelligent. careful editing. and precision 
camera work . Gsnliel Pascal has successfully transferred 
George B~rnard Shaw's play to the screen. With Rex Harrison, 
Wendy Hiller, Robert Morely , Deborah Kerr, and Sybil 
Thorndike, Pascal tastefully provides a fluid translation, full of 
social philosophy, and laced with ironic humor. The story of a 
Salvation Army girl , her munitions manufacturer father , and 
her pragmatic scholar fiance , demonstrated that "the greatest 
of our evils and the worst of our crimes i~ poverty. " 

Tickets are on sale at the Urey Hall Box Office and will be 
available at the door . The films will be shown at 7 p.m. and 
again at 10:30 p.m. in USB 2722. The prices are $1 for students, 
$1.50 for others. For an evening of delighHul entertainment, go 
see these two excellent films . They are definitely worth seeing.

reminiscent of Liszt' s

the piece was modal rather 
than atonal with a heavily 
acoustica l orientation via the 
damper · so tenuto . 

MISS Ro enberger's last 
piece in the set was the Sonata 
No. I, 1946, by Boulez. This 
composi tion reversed the 
concert's direction. returning 
to a definite atonality-
providing a good contrast to 
the Mvsticalitv of Ravel. 
Boulez ' included severa l 
mechanical techniques in his 
sonata (e.g" articulation not 
limited to the fingers but. at 
times. using the whole fist or 
hand.) The piece. howev.er . 
remained well within the 

Miss Rosenberger'S 
audience. though small was 
highly enthusiastic. and she 
showed her apprecia tion in her 
encore piece : Opus 19 No.3 by 
Schubert. The piece was lyrica l 
and subtle. without the obvious 
virtuosi ty of the Chopin 
preludes. but with a certain 
amount of cool elegance and 
professionalism.

Editor 's Note : The following prediction is open to rebuttal or 
last laughs. Just send your prediction to the TRITON TIMES 
office. 

All right . listen up . The Orioles is gonna moider dem bums! 
·The only thing the Pirates are gonna hit is bottom ! Stargell will 
have to wait till next year to see a fastbill1 again. Robertson 
will be so humiliated he'll beg to be traded to Buffalo ! And 
Buffalo ain 't even in the league!

Why? Well . .. Baltimore has only had one lOSing season in 
the last nine. thanks, in large part . to their defense. This has 
been the cornerstone of their success. Brooks Robinson (3rd )' 
Mark Belanger (SS ). Dave Johnson (2nd ) and Boog Powell 
(1st ) have played together now for four years. 

Tritons Dominate BYU 
The Orioles' hitting was off a little this year, but the team 

still led the league in runs scored (794 ). Merv Rettenmund, 
Brooks Robinson. Dave Johnson, Frank Robinson. Don Buford 
and Elrod Hendricks all had IS or more homers . The highest 
batting average on the team was .318, but none was below .250. 
The one drawback is a decided lack of speed . Pill/.s 

There are perhaps a scant 
few people on the UCSD 
campus who remember those 
great days when the water polo 
team which represented the 
school was in a class with the 
original New York Mets - long 
on desire, short on execution. 

The opening game of the 1971 
season last Wednesday against 
BYU, has once and for all 
placed those days of frustration 
and futility in the past. For the 
first time in the history of 
UCSD water polo , the Tritons 
faced somebody with less 
experience than themselves, 
and if you were one of the 
fortunate to obtain a seat 
among the screaming 
multitudes. you are well aware 
that it showed. 

The metamorphosis of the 
Triton watermen is not 
unexpected. since to match the 
scant few of you who 
remember the good old days . 
there are scant few old-timers 
on the team , just two to be 
exact. So to match the BYU 
strategy of clean living and fast 
swimming . t he Triton s 
countered with youth and 
splashing wa ter on the goalies 
glasses. 

The opening moments held 
the hint of a runaway. as 
behind the crafty shooting (and 
splashing ) of freshman Rick 
Pickere ll (Pic krel? 
Pickeral? I. anvwav. behind 
Pickle puss the 'score was 3-0 
after a record 32 seconds of 
play. 

The game final1y settled 
down. though. and to those of 
you just getting to know the 
finer points of the game it 
should be pointed out that 
UCSD was controlling it. Now

that may sound ridiculous, and 
during an occasional lapse , it 
was. But by large it was true, 
the Triton defense limiting the 
Mormon fellows to less than 
ten shots the whole game. 

In defense of both teams it 
must be noted that this was the 
UCer's first game of the season 
to work together, while BYU 
must have been suffering from 
fatigue or disgust or 
something, this being their 
fifth game in three days. Let it 
suffice to say that had the last 
two minutes been erased, the 
score would have been UCSD 6, 
Tabernacle Crew 1. Include 
those last two minutes. and the 
score settles at UCSD 6, BYU 
3. 

This year's team is placing a 
lot of stock in the freshman 
crop of players. At the top of 
the unalphabetized list are 
Dave Turnquist and Pickle. 
(Both hail from Valencia 
oranges, Magic Mountain, etc.) 
Evidently both grew up picking 
oranges in the off-season and 
made the transition to throwing 
the slightly bigger yellow balls 
well enough to cap all-league 
honors. 

Another all·leaguer from the 
CIF Southern Section. which to 
you out of the know is pololand 
USA. is Mike Norris from Mira 

Costa. Mike plays with either a 
stupid grin or a four letter word 
coming out of his mouth, and 
looks about 12-years-cld . so 
he's easy to recognize. 

Also from up north are Dick 
Gregory, a transfer from 
Brown U. (and when you see 
him play without his glasses, 
you'll swear he 's funnier than 
the other one ), and Eric Rosen 
from Miraleste. From the 
ranks of San Diego players the 
Tritons have gathered Ed Huff 
(as in huff and puff) . an All 
CIFer from Crawford and 
Chuck Newman from 
Clairmont. whose name looks 
like someone already tampered 
with it. 

Enough for the introduction 
of new faces . Future 
installments will rehash the 
talents of the old timers (who. 
though slow. have already beat 
the frosh soundly ). Immediate 
attention is turned to this 
Saturday, when the Tritons 
travel to Riverside for the 
annual opening season 
tournament. Seeded third. the 
Tritons have bigger things in 
mind than bronze medals. 
Opening round is against 
Occidental. 

The next home game is on 
Oct . IS against UC Riverside. 
This year fans are discouraged 

from showing up in their 
swimsuits, as this year the 
Tritons have depth and 
audience participation will be 
limited to screaming at the 
refs . 

Pitching is the Bird's long suit. Jim Palmer, Dave McNally, 
Pat Dobson, and Mike Cuellar all won 20 games or more. 
Dobson will probably be saved for long relief in the series. In 
short, I expect the Oriole pitching to stop the Pirates in, say, 
six games. 

Tourney Starts Saturday 
Andy Estabrook 

Looking for a chance to meet that cute red-
haired girl? Blonde? Brunette? Wel1, Charlie 
Browns, here 's your cue. Starting tomorrow 
morning at nine (9 ) o'clock is the UCSD tennis 
club's mixed doubles tournament , which is open 
to anyone at UCSD, including students, faculty 
and staff, with an entry fee of $1. If you haven 't 
heard about it and think you might want to 
enter. you 'd best jet over to that chick 's place 
all excited-like and introduce yourself (and, of 
course. your intentions), because the name 
draw is tonite, which means the entry deadline 
is this evening, which means you better take 
your and your doubles honey's name to the cage 
and find out what's happening. Today! 

The tournament will be played on the gym 
courts, which. for your freshmen. are located 
near the gym. It will be a single elimination 
tournament for the finals, but don't despair, you 
losers will still get a chance to lay your grubby 
hands on some hardware, because there will be 
a loser's elimination bracket with the winner of . 
the losers playing the losers of the winners 
finals match. 

Of the teams entered. the early favorites have 

to be Tibor Safar and Chris Hooper, who just 
happened to win the tournament last year. but 
will face some good competition from the 
dynamic duo of Mike Cruikshank and Grace 
Kennedy. So that 's the way it stands unless 
some of you hot shots get it together and go 
after those turkeys. 

The tournament is sponsored by the UCSD 
tennis club in an effort to bring people who are 
tennis burrs together for the purpose of playing 
tennis (naturally enough ) as well as to have fun 
with other people, which makes sense if you 've 
ever tried to have fun alone. There is a meeting 
of the tennis club on Thursday. Oct. 14, at five 
(5 ) o'clock in the PE classroom. and everyone. I 
mean everyone. is invited to come by and get 
the story on the tennis club first hand. With the 
emphasia on you. the club tries to initiate a 
program that affords you the best opportunity to 
do three things : 1) make friends - friends are 
nice to have, but you don 't make friends sitting 
in your room ,right ? 2) play lots of tennis at your 
own level of competence ; and 3) have fun . You 
need two things to be a happy tennis player, 
good friends and an empty court.
