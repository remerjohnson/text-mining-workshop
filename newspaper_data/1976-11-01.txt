Moxley Sees Possible Reduction In 
Future "Density" of Doctors 

by Joel C. Don 
As oclate News Editor 

UCSD preJIled John Gutheil 
doesn't think twice about spending 
extra hours in the library to get 
those valuable points on hio; 
thermochemistry midterm. The 
constant pressure of competition 
for grades is part of the strenuous 
journey to gain admission to 
medical school. And what John 
doesn't know is that someday, he 
may have to stand in a physician's 
unemployment line. 

John H. Moxley, dean of the 
UCSD School of Medicine believes 
the role . of the physician will 
dramatically change in the future, 
and we won't need the same 

"density" of physicians. Moxley 
adds, however, we shouldn't 
necessarily see a reduction in the 
number of physicians. 

"Within the next 100 years, it is 
extremely conceivable that most, 
if not all, of the major diseases will 
be eliminated," Moxley said, 
suggesting that a better infonned, 
health-conscious public will 
decrease our medical problems. 
He concedes, however, that we will 
always have problems created by 
the environment. 

D,octors in the Future 
According to Moxley, medical 

care in the future will comprise a 
vast spectrum of health workers, 
which means the number of func-

tions - performed by today's 
physicians will be delegated to a 
number of varied professions in the 
allied health sciences. 

Presently physicians make up 10 
percent of alJ health workers, due 
to a dramatic increase in the 
number of non-physician health 
care workers in the last decade. 

As the importance of the MD 
degree is de-emphasized, will the 
status of the medical practicioner 
decline into a less glamourized or 
envied profession? 

"Physicians will always occupy 
the pinnacle," argues Moxley, 
"but we will see a broader field of 
interaction. " 

Recent government proposals 
also affe~ the medical profession.

Beagle Hall Residents 
Sprecheh Sie Deutsch Right to Vote vs. Private Property 

By Paul Watry 
Staff Writer 

If you hear the cry "Auf 
Deutsch, Swine!" echoing from 
one of the Revelle Dorms, don't 
think that you've caught a new 
strain of the Killer nu. It's just 
Beagle Hall, which houses the 
German donn, which are a new 
phenomenon on the UCSD 
campus. 

"A German dorm is where 
people who are interested in 

German language and culture 
can get together and experience 
the spirit of Germany," says 
Steve Northrop, a dorm 
resident. "The theory behind 
the dorms enables people to 
begin to talk and think in 
German. By getting this 
practice, learning German 
becomes much easier." 

Consis~nt German has its 
drawbacks, though. For this 
reason alone, English is 
sometimes used, though it is 
heavily discouraged. 

Mbaimal EqUaIl 
English is kept to a 

minimum," clailDl Han. 
Teuchert, the dorm's 
Residential Adviser. 
"Everyday, we "VI acttvWea 

where the residents are 
required to speak Gennan." 
The activities include dinner 
every night together, and 
soccer IllCItches each Saturday 
morning. 

"We also have a German club 
here," said Teuchert. "The club 
meets on Thursday at 8:30 pm 
and anybody who is interested 
may come and participate." 
The German club acts in con-

with the dorms to 

present lectures, films, outings 
and other activities. 

Both the club and the donns 
were initiated this year. The 
project was primarily started 
and structured by un-
dergraduate students who 
wished to improve their Ger-
man. " We started with 
nothing," explained Teuchert, 
"and then we worked up from 
there. We want the German 
dorms to be positive." 

Does the spoken German 
improve? "Well." said No~

Will Proposition 14, the con-
troversial farm labor initiative, 
take away the private property 
rights of farmers and stifle fair 
representation in the state 
Legislature-. or will it provide 
farmworkers with long deserved 
secret ballot elections and com-
pensation for unfair labor prac-
tices? 

Prop. 14 is designed to amend the 
Agricultural Labor Relations Act 
of 1975. Under that act, the 
Agricultural Labor Relations 
Board (ALRB) was created to hold 
secret-ballot elections for fann-
workers to choose a union to 
represent them. The ALRB is the 
first such election-policing agency 
in American agricultural labor 
history, and promised to end the 
years of headline-making violence 
in California's farmlands. 

Much of the controversy ove" 
Prop. 14 centers around an im-
portant amendment to the ALRB to 
guarantee adequate funding for the 
board. The ALRB closed its offices 
last February after five months of 
operation. It had used up its fun-
ding for the year and was denied by 
the state legislature a $3.7 million 
appropriation requested to con-
tinue operations for the rest of the 
year. 

Labor Board Irresponsible? 
The California Fann Bureau 

Federation (CFBF), which has 
organized Ule campaign for a " no" 
vote on the farmworker's 
initiative, claims that "Prop. 14 
says the Legislature 'shall' put up 
as many tax dolJars 'as may be 
necessary' to finance the ALRB -
the same board that spent its entire 
budget in less than six months just 
last year." . 

The CFBF continues, "Prop. 14 
makes it impossible for the 
Legislature to guarantee that 
California has a workable, up-to-
date farm labor law. It could only 
be changed by another statewide 
vote every two years or 8 costly 
special election. A time-
consuming, cumbersome way to 
run any government." 

Richard Chavez, brother ~ 
United Farmworkers President 
Cesar Chavez, explained the ALRB 
was not properly equipped to 
oversee the 412 elections and over 
800 Unfair Labor Practices filed 
with it. (ULPa arepievHCel fUed 

with the board by one party against 
another. The board is authorized to 
follow up on ULPs, often by holding 
hearings, and can award damages. 

Chavez in an interview last 
week, blamed the growers for the 
no vote on additional funding, 
citing their fear of seeing the UFW 
win the majority of elections, 
which it did do, by a large margin. 
"When the growers failed to get 
legislative changes made in the 
ALRA they pressured Republicans 
and rural Democratic legislators 
to vote no on the extra funds," he 
said. 

Marc Grossman, of the "Yes on 
14" state headquarters, related 
that "on Feb. 6, farmworker voting 
suddenly came to a halt; fann 
labor board offices shut down, and 
the elections staff was laid off. 

Directly to Voters" 
"Mter months of futile attempts 

to approve an appropriations bill in 
Sacramento, the UFW decided to 
bypass the Legislature and go 
directly to the voters through the 
initiative process. In a whiilwind 
29-day campaign last April, farm-
workers and their supporters 
gathered the signatures of 728,000 
California voters to qualify Prop.

Flu Vaccine to be Administered 
This Wednesday in Main Gym 

by John Haberstroh 
Staff Writer 

Why should the public be immunized against the swine flul !lOW when 
some scientists say it may not come here at all? 

The assistant director of the San Diego Public Health Department, Dr. 
Donald Ramras, warns if people don't get immunized now, public health 
facilities may be too overcrowded to immunize everyone when the wine 
flu inevitably comes in pandemic proportions. As of now, the swine flu 
virus has not arrived in the US, although public health officials say it 
should invade within three years. 

In ~976 only on~ person, a 19 ~~ar old soldier at Fort Dix, New Jersey 
has died from swme flu. Authonties are unsure whether the new swine flu 
is the same as the 1918 strain which took the lives cf approximately 20 
f!1illion people, but don't want to take chances with hat many people's 
lives. 

lnununization at UCSD wi1f be in the main gym ~'rom 1-4 pm Wed-
nesday, November 3. Two types of vaccine, one for th old or chronically 
ill and another for the general public, will be ,,_n.,... to.", ~. 
the old.will gU:'rd ag~inst both swine ~lu and Victoria flu, while everyone 
else will be tmrnUOlzed solely against swine flu. Victoria flu says 
Ramras, will definitely hit the US during the next few months, although 
fortWlately. it is not especially harmful. 

Earlier this year, 40 elderly Philadelphians died after receiving the 
vaccine. This has caused many older people to be wary of getting the 
swine flu shot. Ramru assures these people that no connection between 
the swine nu vaccines and the subsequent deaths has been found, urging 
everyone to Ie vaccinated.

Prop. 4: End Unfair UC Practices 

In reading through the "Triton Times Editorial 
Board Election Endorsements" in Wednesday's 
paper, I noted a rather obvious mistake. Surely the 
Board did not really vote to defeat Proposition 4! 

Anyone who has read the many articles which 
have appea red in the Triton Times over the past few 
years concerning the University's curious business 
practices must realize the need for Prop. 4 A yes 
vote OD Prop 4 II a vote for fair educational prac- . 
tice â¢. 

It would require fair admissions policies for all 
population groups and would also give the 
Legislative power, U ~eded, to req~ ~he 
University to adhere to fair business practices (I.e. 
competitive bidding). 

In no way do these Changes threaten the 
University. They do not interfere with its funding or 
with its academic policies. They only give the 
peODle of California the authority to require public 
accountability for the expenditure of pubUc JuDdI, If 
the University acts In a way that shows that this is 
needed. 

Furthermore, past actions by the Uni~rslty have 
shown that sueh public accountability ~ desirable , 
If not necessary . 

A public University must operate fairly as a 
business entity, and must always seek to spend 
public funds in the most efficient way. It is the riglt 
of the taxpayer to say what that way Is. 

Now, Triton Times, isn't that what you really

Prop. 14 Violates Pr.ivacy of Farmworkers 
I am voting NO on Proposition 14 

because I know what it does. It 
gives a great deal of pdwer to a 
special interest group. It does not 
" give the farmworkers the right to 
vote." They already have that 
right by law and have exercised 
that right, since Gov. Brown signed 
the ALRB bill last year. 

Proposition 14 gives " union 
organizers" the power to invade 
the property of any farmer on any 
size farm, without the owner's 

knowledge or consent. 
Union organizers are given three 

hours per day access to any farm. 
If, for example, elections are held 
on a farm and the UFW wins, the 
organizers for the Teamsters union 
could continue to " organize," 
which means work stoppage and 
possible violence between the 
competing unions. The farm 
owners will ha ve no legal recourse. 

available payroU lists containing 
the names, addresses, and social 
security numbers, to any union 
organizers without the farmÂ· 
worker's consent. That would 
certainly end jobs for illegal aliens 
working on the farms. 

It would also end the privacy of 
any farmworker who favored the 
"wrong" lDlion, or who desired no 
W1ion at all. 

Proposition 14, if approved, 
cannot be modified in the sligltest 
way by theÂ·legislature. A statewide 
Initiative would be required to 
change a single word or phrase.

Pro-Environment Candidates 
. 

I would like to put in a plug for envirorunentally-concerned candidates. 
Jack Tunney (U .S. Senate ) has been on the forefront of air pollution and 
energy legislation. He authored a bill to fund federal development of new 
auto engines that would' be both environmentally cleaner and energyÂ· 
efficient. 

Locally, Roger Hedgecock (District N3), Jack Walsh ( Dist~ict H1), and 
Lucille Moore (District N2), candidates for County Supervisor (check 
your sample ballot for your district ) have all established good records in 
office on questions of coastal protection. land use, and envirorunental 
controls . 

Larry Kapiloff (State Assembly, District 1/78) has been a leader on 
energy conservation, coastline p~otection: and land use . Tn thp ~Ih 
District, Jim Cohelan is an attractive candidate, and even more so w .. ~~ 
one looks at the voting record established by his opponent (Jim Ellis) 
while a member of the San Diego City Council. Jim Ellis has been an 
outspoken opponent of coastal protection.

Media Fails in Campaign Coverage 
I was very disappointed, though 

not at aU surprised, by the 
Editorial Election Endorsements, 
featured In the October 'Z1 edition 
of the Triton Times. Perhaps it 
should have read "Editorial 
Bored." 

No endorsement was made in the 
presidential race. This non-action 
was justified by the fact that the 
IT editors feel that neither Jerry 
Ford nor Jimmy Carter " seems to 
be the type of leader needed to lead 
America through these troubled 
and restless times." Less that fifty 
percent of the eligible voters will 
cast ballots next Tuesday. I'm not 
sure " restless and troubled" 
describes the American scene. 
Maybe " lethargic and ~tuporous" 
would be more appropriate. 

numbering as many as ten on some 
state's ballots. 

At no time bas the 'IT discussed 
the issues that are of importance to 
its readers . 

The entire media coverage of 
this campaign has been 
dlsasterous, a factor on which 
voter apathy and confusion can, to 
a tremendous extent, be blamed. 
The prtlss refuses to concentrate on 
real issues, instead wallowing in 
personality sketches, and am-
plifying minor mistakes made by 
each candidate in tbe course of the 
grueling campaign. 

to its readers in an objective, 
positive fashion, so that, based on 
this information, . the reader may 
make rational decisions. 

The Triton Times has failed 
again. 

For an American citizen to have 
an attitude of indifference 'con-
cerning elections is disconcerting. 
For an American newspaper to 
have the same attitude is inex-
cusable.

And what has the Triton Times 
do ne to lift the fog of apathy from 
the eyes and minds of bewildered 
voters? They have given limited 
coverage to only three candidates, 
Ford, Carter, and McCarthy. No 
mention has been made of the 
other Presidential candidates. 

The Triton Times is also guilty of 
ignoring the gut issues of this 
campaign. Instead, the editors 
throw up their collective hands and 
say that they~are "confused, 
cynical, and sharply divided." 'IT

Spaceship Earth. 1976. The oceans are dying. The air is contaminated. 

The water is polluted. Animal and marine species are disappearing. Our 
fo~sts are clear-cut. Our mountains are trip-mined. Our rivers and streams 
are dammed. diverted and channelized. Our future is being ransomed to 
the uncertainties and hazards of nuclear power. And on Tuesday, we will 
elect a President who must face it all. 

What difference does your vote make? 
Quite simply. it makes the difference between environmental hope and 

environmental despair. It makes the difference between Jimmy Carter-who 
is the best environmental candidate in ~eventy years-and Gerald Ford -
who is probably the worst. On no other issue in this Pre idential campaign 
are the differences between Carter and Ford more clea rl y defined. And 
every serious environmentalist in the c,ountry know it. 

Last April , the prestigious Na tional League of Conservation 
Voters published an exha us tive, six-month study on the environ. 
mental records of each m ajor candidate. Jimmy Carter received 
the League's highest rating: OUTSTANDING. Gerald Ford received 
the lowest rating: HOPELESS_ On every major envi ro nmental issue 
facing us, these ratings represent the choice we face_ 

What we face is the most important environmental election of our life-
time. The choice is clear. The choice is in your hands. PLEASE ... make your

mentalist, for President. 

The environmental health of the planet depends on it.

Stanford's field h ckey team 
came to UCSD on Friday and gave 
the Tritons a taste of big-school 
stick-handling in handing UCSD a 
5-0 defeat.

Cardinal victory . (TT photo: Chris 
Sherman) 

The Cards' defense was effective 
in holding the Tritons scoreless and 
limiting them to only a couple of 
shots on goal the entire game. 

Stanford was held pretty well in 
check by the Tritons in the first 
half, scoring only two goals. Just 
about the entire half was played in 
UCSD territory, a credit to the 
Tritons' defense in allowing only 
two goals. 

Unfortunately the best defense is 
a good offense, which the Tritons 
couldn't come up with. The 
Stanford team was simply too 
experienced and too well-
conditioned. They went after the 
ball aggressively and kept their 
offense in control. 

The second half started well for 
UCSD. They were aggressive and 
kept the game balanced, much of 
the early action taking place in 
Stanford's end of the field. But they 
couldn't come up with a score and 
finally the Cardinal offense heated 
up and scored three rapid goals 
towards the end of the game to 
make the final score, 5~. 

UCSO's Women's V'Ball 
Hands USIU Crushing Defeat 

By Ron Kato 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's women's volleyball team proved once again to be the superior 
unit on the court by crushing USIU last Friday 15-1, 15-7. 

Ineffective with its passing, USIU was able to execute only one of-
fensive hit in the entire first game. The Tritons tallied when USIU could 
not return the first service of the game on three hits. UCSD, perfonning 
well, scored eight more times before yielding to its opponents' lone score. 

San Diego without its full team on hand, played a good part of the match 
with four setters on the court. Setter Holly Steward in an unusual role as a 
front line hitter was quite effective from her new position. As in-
consistency marked USIU's passing and setting, the Tritons utilized 
every opportunity to capitalize on these errors. 

Game two got on its way with starting hitters Jennifer Freed and Eva 
Ljungwe on the bench. Substitute Karen Kaehler filled in well for the 
starters and San Diego jumped out in front 7-l. 

At this point, USIU's top player Amelia Walling initiated her team's 
strongest comeback effort. Three tough serves, the last of which went 
\Ultouched, narrowed the Tritons' lead to three. After a series of side out 
exchanges, USIU, unable to set up Walling, the team's only effective 
hitter, missed out on many scoring opportunities. 

This apparently sealed the game for the Tritons and as the San Oiegans 
began to lax off, coach Chuck Millenbah yelled to his squad from the side, 
to play seriously. "It seems like we play better against stronger teams," 
reflected captain Andrea Beylen after the match. And with the Tritons 
having very little difficulty handling most of their opponents, the players 
seem to respond only to the tougher matches. 

Aileen Horimoto and Stewart were again named as the outstanding 
players of the game by coach Millenbah. 

The team closes out a four game homestand today against MiraCosta in 
the rec gym. Starting time is scheduled for 4: 30 pm.

UCSD Wears 
O'ut UCI JV 
I n Water Polo 

by Eric Orloff 
Staff Writer 

The steadily improving Triton 
water polo team outpointed 
Irvine's J .V. team 9-5 Saturday. 

UCSD put things together at both 
ends of the pool for one of its best 
performances thus far in the 
season. 

The Tritons jumped out to a 
quick 3~ lead with seven minutes. 
gone, then wore out the Aardvarks 
to win. 

The offense was led by Dave 
Denton who tossed in three goals 
andÂ· demonstrated some adept ball 
handling, while Dennis Thomas 
was all over the pool, swiping the 
ball from his befuddled opponents 
and returning it to his teammates. 
He also slammed one home from 
the outside, to spark the Tritons' 
second half surge. 

On defense, goalie Bob Alei 
thwarted the Aardvarks time after 
time inclUding an outstanding one-
hand jab deflection of a fourth 
quarter Irvine penalty shot. 

It was a good day for the Tritons 
who face an uphill climb in 
preparing for the winter tour-
nament about four weeks away. 
Both teams played well giving the 
standing-room audience an ex-
citing ball game.
