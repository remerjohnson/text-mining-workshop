Division III evades the drug test 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO, Sports I:dltor 

U C D has been able to ."'-IIR!-.... avoid what has become the latest rage to hit 
college athletics: drug testing. The 

AA ~nJer the microscopIc 
sc rutiny of the public and media . 
has hau its image battered by the 
barrage of drug scandals that 
have rocked Division I 
institutions. all catapulted by the 
cocaine- induced death of Len 
Bias. 

Because of it's lack of the 
national spotlight. Division III 
athletics have been able to hide 
in it's isolated shelL Although the 
drug testing policy of the NCAA 
theoretically encompasses all 
divisions, UC D, along with it's 
brother institutions. have for the 
most pan , not felt the effects that 
the Division I schools have been 
deluged by. 

NCAA legislation mandates the 
testing of student-athletes at post 
season championships and bowl 
games. Although several of the 
athletes involved with the 
Division I football bowl games 

. were tested. the UCSD teams 
involved in post-season 
championships - women's 
volleyball , men's and women's 
soccer - were not. "We're not 
going to test all teams involved 
in post-season play." said Frank 
Uryasz - Assistant director of 
research and science. "As far as 
Division III is concerned, only 
the teams involved in the football 
quarterfinals were tested , but 
more sports will be added in the 
future ." 

UCSD coaches, in general, 
support the NCAA's move for 
drug testing. "We're pan of the 
NCAA and we've got to follow 
their rules," said UCSD swim 
coach Bill Morgan. "I'm sure it's a 
conscious choice they're able to 
make. It's JUSt like you don't have 
to drive a car, but if you do 
decide to , you have to agree to 
go 55 miles per hour or pay the 
onsequences. I see that as the 

same type of issue ." 
. Andy Skid, assistant athletic 
director who also serve as track 
and field , and cross-country 
coach also takes the tand 
behind the NCAA. "NCAA i a 
governing body for athletics and 
olleges and universities," said 

Skicf "and I feel they should 
have a say in what's to be done 
as rar as drug use in athletics." 

In-hou e drug testing among 
several Division I institutions has 
caused further controversy. Joe

John Dower, holder of the 
Jo eph aiman Endowed Chair 
in Japane e Studies at UC D, has 
been named winner of the J986 
Nativnal Book Critic Circle 
AWllrd for on-Fiction for his 
book. War Without Mercy: Race 
cmJ Puwer ill till' Pacific \Var 
(Pantheun, 1986). 

1 he annual award IS given by 
a panel of book reviewers from ' 
major newspapers and 
magazines. Dower's book wa 
also one of the five finalists m 
the non-fiction categ01Y of the 
1986 American Book Awards. 

Dower said that he was 
pica ed that a book dealing with 
such harsh and controversial 
themes as war and racism was 
recogmzed as a con~tructive 
ll!tempt to wrestle WIth these 
problems. 

According to Dower what se ts 
the book apan is that it 
examines the role of ra e in the 
Pacific war more closely than 
other sources and also does so 
in a omparative framework. It is 
a new way of rrying to come to 
gnps with the war, and it draws 
broader conclusions for 
contemporary United States-
Japan relations and also 
problems of racism, violen e and 
war today. 

Dower is considered the 
country's leading authority on 
the American occupation of 
Japan and how that 0 cupation 
changed Japanese society 
followmg World War II. Dower's 
mterests extend not only to 
modem Japanese hiStory, bur 
mclude U.s.-Asian relations and 
Japanese art as well. 

Dower earned his Ph.D from 
Harvard University in history 
and far eastern languages. and 
had been at the UniverSity of 
WisconSin prior to commg to 
UCSD last year.

O VER Ihe past weeks , tlL'tlvit)' on the site of the luture University Center 
seems ll) have qUietly tapered off. 
leaVIng the bulldozers and 
backhoes silent in their corm I. 

The repon of Ihe Institutes 
worsening financial si tuation was 
:'dead wrong," Sinkin said . A ~6 
million grant was given to 
establish the Insti tute of Ihe 
Americas by the Gildred 
Foundation whose preside nt, 
Theodore Gildred, is presetly 
U.S. ambassador to Argentina. 

The money funded the 
construction of the building 
donated to UCSD and endowed 
three chai rs in Lann American 
studies at the University. Wayne 
Cornelious occupies the first 
chair. Paul Drake the second, 
and Peter H. Smith the third. 

Sinkin explained the four ways 
by which Ihey lulfill thm and lea t understood phenomena 

in the Americas today. 
Executive workshops arc purely 

business discussions . Only limited 
executive clientele arc invited and 
reqUired to pay a nominal fcc . 
Dialogue MeXICO is the next 
workshop to be held on February 
6-7 . 

Community Briefings are 
public presentations open w 
UCSD students, invited guests. 
and community leaders for a 
certain attend,lIlce fcc. "We 
encourage students (() co me and 
~ broaden thm knowledge of 
~ economiC , political. and sl)ctal 
.3 issues in latin America for a 
::-- better inter-American perspective 
~ of Hemispheric issues." Sinkin 
~. said. 

Although It may seem that 
development has. if not stopped . 
at least been delayed , Fall of 
1988 IS stili the target date for 
completion of the center, 
according to Tommy Tucker, 

AsSI~t,11lt Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs. There 
have not been any major 
setb<1cks in the process. 
However. Tucker commented 
thaI It is standard for full 
completion to be late by one or 
two months. 

Inilially, said Tucker, the 
biddmg process was planned to 
have been underway by now. but 
IS bemg delayed until contra tors 
finish revlewmg the bid 
documents Il) r the San Dtego 
Convention Center. After the city 
awards the contrac ts for Ihe 

Remaining funds provide the 
necessary seed money for the 
new institute to develop. "Being 
a fairly new organization with a 
bright and prosperous future 
ahead, the endowment was set 
up to dip imo and help our 
growth: Sinkin said .

Editor: 

How quickly do we forget? 
During 14 long years, Dean 
Varga burned the midnight oil 
on behalf of students, faculty and 
staff. 

In our haste to grow and to 
compete in the academiC big 
league s, UC San Diego must not 
forget the ind ividual people who 
generated the· campus reputation 
III the early years. 

Perhaps, the UCSD 
admllli tranon had become 
weary or Dean arga's 
commitment to social activism 
and leadership for moral 
responsibility. In some ways, the 
dean held alive the memories of 
the 1960s. UCSD now re presents 
the high technology of future 
decades. 

We at least owed Dean Varga 
a respectful thank you and a 
symbolic gold watch for 
dedicated service. Instead , the 
dean was summanly dismissed 
and shuffled out the door 
without dignity. 

Dean Varga spent her cntlre 
professional career creating the 
rules and regulations which are 
JudiCiously utilized to mediate 
the campus cond uct system. 

When the dean needed a fair 
hearing. the process fa iled . 

Perhaps we were really afraid 
of Dean Varga. The dean's ideas 
have always been controversial 
by their brilliance. It is 
disconcening to watch a bright 
light suffer under the guise of 
UCSD's bureaucracy. 

Dean Varga dared to be 
dirferent. The dean asked 
nothing but the best for her 
students. She challenged a 
generation to achieve excellence. 

There is no good answer for 
what happened to Dean Varga . 

Sure the administration is 
working backwards to construct 
a case. We all lose together when 
the bureacuracy stands in the 
way of good thinking and ethical 
behavior. 

How can UC San Diego 
project an image of greatness 
when we step on our past in the 
drive to build a future? Dean 
Varga and her style remain a 
pan of the campus heritage. 
Goodbye Bev. Thank you fo r all 
the you have done for us.

1 am writing, on behalf of our 
officers and membership, to 
express our concem over 
allegations made by Third 
College alumni regarding Provost 
Faustina Solis in an anicle in 
your December 4. 1986 issue . 
Our Association fu lly supports 
Faustina Solis, the highest 
ranking Hispanic administrator 
at UCSD. Her dedication and 
many years or service to UCSD 
and to the San Diego community 
should not be clouded by these 
unsubstantiated negative 
allegations by a few individuals. 

Our professionalism prevents 
us from discussing the merits of 
these allegations regard ing her 
administrative decision regarding 
one of her employees, as we fee l 
that these are confidential 
matters under the purview of the 
Academic Personnel Office. 
Suffice it to say that we agree 
with Vice Chancellor Watson's 
assessment of the alumni 's plans 
to withhold Contributions from

UCLA was either fooled by anta 
Barbar.! in the first game or they 
Just played 11Ippy. They were 
Cllmpletely flloled and outpl'lyed , 

The second game wa - even 
more exciting from Santa

Gauchos looked as if they were 
gOIng III run ,Iway WIth the 
Imm:h as they went up 10-5

It wasn't Just the scorl' that 
made It exciting, it was the 
quality of play, and It carried out 
through the entire tournament. 
Smaller teams such as the 
Tritons , the Gauchos and the 
others shllwed that with some 
~rcat tactics they can play some 
exciting volleyball: just lIke what 
California is known all over the 
country for . , mJ 

A H. there ,Ire ,I lot of things that ould be said about the all UniversIty

tournamtnt or the talented 
players. Belter yet , how ,Ibout a

First of all , Cahfornia sehools 
are known for great volleyball. 
Eight teams from CalifornIa put 
eXCItement in a whole dIfferent

imagine what kind of imensll}' to

The Tritons' first mat ' h

The first two games were long 
and very close agaInst San

lirst , 15- 12 and then lost the 
second 10-15. In the deCISive 
third game they reg,lined 
momentum ,md won easily, 15-4. 

Santa Barbam , UC D's next

Bourg, a cross cou ntry runner for 
UC Berkeley, recently filed a 
lawsun against the university 
staling that drug testing infringed 
on Bourg's consti tutional rights. 
Twenty-four hours before the 
lawsuit was to be filed . the 
university, trying to avert the 
suit, temporarily postponed all 
in-hou e drug testing of athletes. 
"UCSD doesn 't have to deal with 
the type of problems a Divi sion 1 
school lIke ours has to," said 
Tom Malinowski. vice president 
01 student aflairs for A UCB. 
"UC 0 doesn't play on TV so

was a simple, effective way of 
sayi ng 'yeah were doing 
something' but it does nothing to 
solve the drug problem. 

The consti tionality of the drug 
testing has also raised some legal 
issues. "The kind of drug testing 
where large, random samples are 
taken, in my opinion, is not 
constitutional," said WIlham 
Schaap. attorney and member of 
the Center for Constitutional 
Rights III New York City." 

This is precisely the blanket 
Intrusion that our Bill of Rights IS

that there's no just or probable

The NCAA did a survey to 
find out the number of schools 
involved with in-house drug 
tes ting. The results. broken down 
by each diviSIon, show that 
compared to the high prcssure of 
Division I athletics, Division III is 
like a sunny day at the golf 
course. The survey asked "Does 
the athletic dept currently utilize 
drug testing for student-athletes?" 
36 percent of the DiVision I 
chools participating in the 

survey answered yes, and 17 
pcrcent answered no. but were 
currently planning to drug test 
their athletes. On the other 
hand , 0 percent of the Division

Riding 
an emotional 
rollercoaster 

by david forman 

. 198 7s Blac k Hi s to ry 
Celebration kicked off its six 
week program last Thursday, 
January 15. The Celebration 
includes speakers, concerts 
and films among the many 
cultural events that will take 
place through the first of 
March. While last week saw 
discussions and pa rades 
surrounding the celebration 
of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 
birthday, the weeks to come 
are filled with diverse events, 
all connected in some fashion 
to the black experience. 
Perhaps the most noteworthy 
event is tomorrow night's 
performance by the Negro 
Ensemble Company of Lonne 
Elder Ill ' s 1969 play 
"Ceremonies in Dark Old 
Men." 

" C eremonies, II as Joe 
Pollack of the St. Louis Post~ 
Dispatch writes, "takes the 
audience on an emotional 
roller coaster , swooping 
through all th e many 
paradoxes of a family 
relationship and examining 
the fabric of which it's 
woven." Specifically , the play 

is set in Harlem in the 1950's, 
where Russell Parker Sr., ex~ 
vaudevillian and unsuccessful 
black barber, must cope with 
living with his daughter and 
two sons, after his wife has 
committed suicide. Russell is 
content to just sit and play 
checkers with his friend 
William Jenlcins; and \liS two 
sons Theapolis and Bobby, 
mainly loaf around all day; 
but his daughter Adele, 
however, following in her 
mother's footsteps , insists 
that they find work. 

Pressed by economic 
hardships and with a desire 
for quick cash, Theopolis and 
Bobby meet up with a seedy 
character named Blue Haven, 
who is well versed in schemes 
to get rich quick. Soon all the 
Parker men, as well as Jenlcins, 
become involved with Blue 
Haven. The schemes payoff 
and they make money, but 
when they affiliate themselves 
with organized crime, they 
become consumed by greed, 
and their family ties become 
strained. 

It has been written that 

"Ceremonies" deals with " the 
waste of human potential 
brought about by the ghetto~ 
izing of minds and bodies." In 
his script, Elder (who is 
perhaps better known for his 
screenplay for Sounder) shows 
this waste , and th e 
disintegration of family by 
juxtaposing each character's 
response to their situation 
against one another. With 
each caricature, Elder places 
together a whole picture of the 
time period . Despite the 
bleakness of the subject 
matter, the play is sometimes 
funny; more importantly , it is 
always poignant. 

"Ceremonies in Dark Old 
Men" has a long, respected 
history as a play. It was first 
presented off Broadway in 
1969, and in 1974, it was 
dramatized for television on 
ABC. Co~founder of N.E.C., 
Douglas Turne r W ard , 
portrayed Russell Parker both 
in the off Broadway and the 
television versions. In the 
UCSD production, Gil Lewis 
will re-create the lead role. 
The play was first revived by 
the NEC in 1985, when they 

took it on the road , including 
stops i n New Yo rk , 
Washington and St. Louis. 

The NEC has actually 
performed over 200 plays, 
giving a forum to stories that 
deal with black experience. 
They have performed all 
around the world , and took 
part in the 1984 Los Angeles 
Olympic Arts Fest ival. 
Among their most successful 
productio ns was Charles 
Fuller's " A Soldier's Play, " 
which, with their help, was 
turned into the film A Soldier's 
Stary. It was subsequently 
nominated for an Academy 
Award for Best Picture. Over 
the years, the NEC had been 
honored for their achieve~ 
ments in theatre, including 
two Tony awards. and a New 
York Drama Critics C ircle 
Award . 

"Ceremonies" is only part 
of an impress ive list of 
upcom ing eve nts with in 
1987 's Bl ack Hi s t o r y 
Celebration. Some of the 
other notable events include 
Garth Fagan's Bucket Dance 
Company at Mandeville 

Auditorium on February 6 
and Jazz artist Sonny Rollins , 
also at Mandeville Auditor-
ium on February 18. Visi ting 
U CSD professor Farre ll 
Foreman has directed the play 
" Black Gravy," which will be 
performed in the Warren 
Apartment Commons on 
February 12, 14, 21 and 22 . 

In support of the six week 
celebration , the literature 
department is sponsoring a 
Black History Essa y Contest 
for all UCSD undergraduates. 
The contest will award prizes 
in many different types of 
writing, but the deadline for 
submissions is January 30.

Having just watched a salads are offered along with

Denny's would be loud and and headed toward a table. By

must have looked a bit 
confused because one of the 
employees approached me 
and said that I was to tell the 
attendant at the bar what I 
wanted and my order would 
be brought to my table. 

Looking at the menu. I 
discovered that Java has an 
extensive list of flavored 
coffee drinks (including 
cappucino. Cafe Latte. Cafe 
Au Lait. Cafe Mocha. among 
others) and many different 
blends of coffee. To 
accompany the coffee. the 
entire left side of the menu is 
devoted to various foods.

informed me that the works

and Medical School

displays. He varies them 

cordin eo an informal 
schedule:-The current display 
features the works of Roget 
Herman. Gary Lange, and 
Astrid Preston. I also learned 
of another connection 
between USCD and Java: the 
shop is {llanaged by Stanley 
Fried, who at one time was the 
administrative director of the 
Center for Music Experiment 
located on Warren Campus at 
UCSD. 

Since my first trip to Java. I 
have become a frequent 
customer. After each visit. I 
am further impressed with 
both the service and the food. 
I have had several of the 
different coffee drinks, all 
with equal satisfaction. Along 
with these attributes. Java is 
easily accesible because of its 
long hours : Sunday-
Thursday. 11 am to 1 am -
Friday and Saturday. 11 am to 
2 am. All in all, Java provides 
an extremely ' enjoyable 
excursion, any time of day.

• • animation 
bv phil macgovern 

If I only get dne thing 
through to you during the 
course of this review, it 
should be that you must go to 
the Ft:stival of Animation! It is 
really great. If you think that 
the only real animation is on 
early Saturday morning 
television. or in the occasional 
Disney feature length film. 
think again. Animation has 
been floating around as a little 
recognized art form for many 
years. The Festival of 
Animation is just one of the 
ways that you can go see 
fantastic and funny anima-
tion. This time. the Festival 
consists of sixteen films 
varying in length from three to 
fifteen minutes. 

Some you may have seen 
before. like the California 
Raisin Department's "I Heard 
It Through the GrapeVine" 
claymation or Talking Heads 
video for "And She Was." 
Others though. you are 
unlikely to have seen. for they 
are from exotic places like 
Czechoslovakia and the 
Netherlands. Some have 
underlying deep and 
philosophical meaning, while 
others are there for the 
audience's amusement. One 
thing that must be under-
stood: each on the sixteen is a 
fantastic example of the craft 
of animation. The ones that 1 
recommend are "Luxo Jr ....

The collection has been 
open for just a month. but 
it is already very 
succesful. They are 
starting to expand their 
collection to include more 
traditional artists. as well 
as artists, whose ex-
pressions of Judaica are 
new and interesting. One 
of the stand outs at the 
J udaiCollection is a series 
of cut out art by local 
artist Shendl Diamond. 
Ms. Diamond's art 
consists of a manuscript 
written on a piece of 
paper. with designs cut 
out around the edges. 
Adding to the effect is 
hand-painted silk placed 
behind the paper cut 
design. to give the illusion 
of depth to the cut 
sections. Among the 
different manuscripts that 
Ms. Diamond draws from 
is the traditional Ketuba 
Uewish Wedding Certifi-
cate). that both bride and 
groom must sign to 
validate their marriage in 
the eyes of Judaism. Her 
work is truly beautiful.
