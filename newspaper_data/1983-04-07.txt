Media coverage of the March 
21-22 nuclear missile protest 
at Vandenberg Air Force Base 
has long since dried up, but for 
some of the participants, 
including one UCSD tudent, a 
long string of litigation and 
court appearances lay ahead . 
The story goes beyond the 
fron t gate skirmishe that 
were duly flashed on front 
pages and television screens, 
as over 100 protestor hiked 
across government land to 
lean up against the missile 
assembly plant , stamp their 
feet on concrete silo and gaze 
upon the military 's shuttle 
launch pad . 

The event was orgamzed by 
the Vandenberg Action 
Coalition (VAC ) which 
obtained funding from vanous 
environmental and peace 
groups, gathered topographi -
cal map of the area and 
screened and trained 
participant in civil di obedi-
ence technique. A total of 
eight UCSD students joined 
the VAC encampment on 
Sunday, located on a plot of 
private land near the base, 
striking out for Vandenberg at 
3 am the following morning.

Zionism, Imperialism 
Threaten World Peace 
Editor: 

Let's stop Zionism, 
Imperialism, and their dear 
respected accomplice -
communism. The world of 
unfortunates, which is called 
the Third World, is crying loud 
for being devastated by these 
nefarious elements. By looking 
at the political situations 
around the world and every 
individual country labeled 
Third World , a tremendous 
amount of facts remain 
obscured. To exemplify these 
nations' misery and to be 
specific, the legacy of 
beleaguered ac tivities of 
Zionists remains documented. 
The Zionist s tate fir s t 
recognized by the USSR 
among its numerous delet-
erious acts has changed a land 

of passion into a land of scorn 
and revenge, once belonged to 
Palestinians. 

Israel continues to perpet-
uate around the world and 
cause destitution and a trail of 
blood. Upon seeking the nature 
of such beleaguered activities, 
Zionism has revealed itself to 
be racist, deceitful , conspira-
torial and murderous. In the 
past th irty-five years, it has 
proven itself to be as vile as its 
author's thoughts regarding 
the inalienable rights of all 
human beings in all societies 
to live without fear of the 
strong tyrannizing the weak.

Yesterday's LAGO Blue Jeans Day brouaht forth varyinl opinions throulhout campus. Gays 
couidered their day an opportunity for straiaht students to experience bein, incorrectly 
"labeled." Straiaht students felt that jeans were too common an item to have eay sipificaace, 
and a poor choice for ,ay representation. Our photographer was unable to find any dungaree 
clad bodie8, as the weather was not condu8ive to the cause. 

Letters to the Editor 

LAGO 'Jeans Day' Brews Controversy 
Editor: 

On Gay Blue Jeans Day, gay 
people show their pride, make 
themselves visible, and give 
each other support by all 
wearing blue jeans. We've 
hung banners all over campus 
to get the word out, and so that 
straight people know that this 
is Gay Blue Jeans Day. 

dress. We are qUIte partial to 
blue jeans and we don't plan to 
hang them up just because of 
the gays' publicity stunt. 

Task Force Report Railroaded 

Also, if straight people get 
" caught" with their jeans on , 
then they will perhaps see 
what it's like to be labeled 
something they are not . Of 
course, non-gay supporters of 
gay people are invited to show 
their support. LAGO asks that 
all gay people at UCSD (there 
should be at least 1250) to 
show their support for Gay 
rride by wearing their blue 
Jeans. 

Russell Lewis 
Sharon Moxon 

lAGO Representatives 

We all have our nghts and 
should be able to dress as we 
please without having people 
misconstrue our intentions. If 
the gays wanted to show their 
popularity , they should 've 
picked something a little less 
popular than blue jeans. We 
propose that people who are 
gay and who support the gay 
communi ty wear LAGO t-
shirts to stand up for what 
they believe in. 

An open letter to all UCSD 
students: 

On Monday, March four· 
teenth, twenty·eight st udents 
met with Vice Chancellor 
Watson regarding the recently 
released Student Center task 
force repor t. the organizations 
from which these students 
came include Student 
Affirmative ActIOn Commit· 
tee. Women 's Center. Food 
Coop, KSDT , AS UCS D , 
General Store Coop. ASIan 
American Student Alliance. 
Torrey Farms Coop, Recycling 
Coop. EDNA. ThIrd College 
CouncIl. Black Student lInion. 
Che Cafe, MECHA. and the 
neu' indicator. The common 
denominators brInging the'>e 
student'> together are 
threefold: Flr'>t. the member 
orga nI zations are dIrectly 
am nected WIth the Student 
Center. Second. the expressed 
concern WIth the content of 
the task force report and . 
thi rd . the outrage with the 
process by which thIS report 
was delIvered to the university 
communIty (I.e. Watson stated 
that he was going to make a 
decis ion on the task force 
recommendations only two 
and a half days after the report 
became public). 

The meeting with Joe 
Watson was an educational 
experience for all tho,>e in 
attendance. Vice Chancellor 
Watson demon st ra ted a 
complete di sregard for the 
democratic principles that we 
adhere to in our student 
organizations and. one that 
we are taught our UnIversity 
and country are based upon. 

T he task force report stales 
on page two thal. "the report 
s hould be rev iewed and 
discussed by all interested 
members of the un iversity." 
We feel that two and one half 
working days during the 
oncoming of fina l i ' not 
nearly enough time for all or 

even a handful of "interested 
members " to review and 
discuss a proposal of such 
magnitude and effect. Yet the 
disagreements the twenty· 
eight of u have with the task 
force (and we compri e 
probably ninety percent of all 
students who have even heard 
of the report) recommenda-
tions were serious enough to 
warrant us scheduling a 
meeti ng with Vice Chancellor 
Watson on the free day of 
final s week. 

The most frightenIng 
dIsplay of Watson's contempt 
for due process was evidenced 
dunng the follOWIng sequence 
of events. Watson informed us 
that he would postpone his 
decision on accepting the task 
force recommendations if the 
Student Center Board 
instructed him to do so. We 
pomted out that the board had 
first seen the proposal only a 
few days earlier at their last 
meeting. If the board were to 
reach a decision they would 
first have to consult with their 
respective constituencies and 
the co n ve ne a meetIng 
amongst themselves. None of 
this could take place until 
spring quarter. E\'en the task 
force report recommends that 
the board operate under 
Robert 's Rules of Order which 
stipulate that new bus iness 
cannot be acted upon until 
reintroduced as old business at 
a s ubsequent meeting. Po 
further dIsregard of estab-
lIshed procedure was the 
omittance of the Associated 
Students and the Graduate 
Student Council in reVIewing 
th is propo ·al. These bodies are 
ma ndated to app rove a ll 
changes in the Student Center 
Board Charter. T hey have yet 
to see the report. 

Vice Chancellor Watson was 
then not ified that Paul Jensen 
the S tudent Center Boa rd 
chirperson, was on the phone 

to speak with him. Watson 
excused himself to answer the 
call. When he returned, 
Watson notified us thatJensen 
had just taken a phone survey 
of all but two of the Student 
Center Board members, a 
majority of which wished 
Watson to accept the task 
force report. He said he would 
now do so. 

One of the Student Center 
Board members was in the 
room with us that day. She 
was not contacted by phone. 
We have since spoken wit h 
three other Student Cen ter 
Board member~ who claim 
they were not contacted by 
phone either. BeSIde the fact 
we \.\ ere lIed to alx)ut who was 
and who was not polled over 
the telephone, the procedure of 
decision-making by sponta n· 
eous phone ca lling in lieu of 
sc heduled open meetings 
where debate can take place, is 
a serious breach of established 
process. T o have a Vice 
Chancellor in charge of 
Student Affairs condone such 
practice makes a mockery of 
democratic process. 

The railroading of the task 
force report is a testament to 
the administ ra tion 's concern 
for student input. We cannot 
create an envi ronment of 
mutual respect and t rust 
between s t udents a nd 
administration if occurrences 
of this kind continue. 

We informed Vice Chan· 
cellor Watson on Monday that 
we would make a comprehen· 
sive writ ten reply to the task 
fo rce report . We asked to be 
given un t il Friday of the third 
week of spring quarter to do 
so. Given that the future 
development of the Student 
Center depends on the task 
force report, we feel our time 
line is reasonable. Our offer 
still stands.

Oxbridge colleges system, and 
assuming that to be based on it 
it is a good thing, which the 
founders apparent ly assumed , 
where did UCSD go wrong? 

The first thing one notices 
at, for instance, Cambridge. is 
that it is a collection of about 
25 colleges and halls. Classes 
and clu bs pull these separate 
inst itutions together to be one, 
but li fe centers on the college. 
One lives, takes meals, and has 
one's academic advisor, or 
tutor , there. The intention is 
to give the undergraduate a 

On the other hand, if UCSD 
does not improve thequalityof 
its food, a meal would , instead 
of being congenial to fnendly 
exchange, be conductive to 
melancholy withdrawal. 

However. if there were to be 
required association among 
the members of a college, 
including not only students 
bu t a lso the faculty and 
administrators, the size of the 
college would still be too 
overwhelming. We have a 
university of 12,000 students 

The UCSD Guardian 

divided into four parts , while 
the size of the largest 
Cambridge college is 1.000, 
and of the smallest about 300, 
including .the staff. It is 
difficult to become intimate 
with 4,000 people unless one is 
a politician or a prostitute 
(which , I suppose, come to 
more or less the same thm~). 
Besides, the mass itself is 
threatening; when a professor 
announces a 4,000 word paper, 
one shies away from becoming 
acquainted with even a few of 
the words. 

In England one has a 
Director of Studies, a Fellow of 
one's college and specialist in 
one's field. He adVIses on the 
schedule of lectures and 

arranges one s 'supervlslons,' 
informal discussions with a 
specialist and Fellow of the 
college, whIch take place a fev. 
times a week. It never occurs 
to many of us to drop 10 on our 
professors (unless enlIghtened 
on methods of fawning on the 
grade givers). and usually the 
visit has the least priority and 
gets cut in the press of events 
(i.e., homework). YelInformal 
discussion IS probably more 
important to becomIng a 
scholar than ingesting 12. 16. 
or 20 lecture hours a week. 

"There is one feature which 
sets this campus apart from

Library Buys BLIS 
By KEVI N WALSH 

Staff Writer 
Library research and the 

ta:;ks of library sen ice will 
begin to become easier and 
more efficient in the commg 
academic year. After more 
than three years of gathering 
info:-mation and testing 
various computer system for 
library use, UCSD librarians 
have decided to purchase the 
BLlS (Biblto-Tech Library and 
Infor'!lation System). 

With BUS, UCSD IS moving 
out of the manual era into 
automation. Among libraries 
all over the country, VCS1)'s 
are clearly m the mamstream . 

BLIS IS prima rily a 
cataloging and proces 109 
s)-stem rather than a card 
catalog on a creen such as 
MELVYL, the V.C. on line 
library catalog. However , 
BUS IS capable of being 
expanded to include card 
catalog functions. Instead of 
fi !ling ou t charge cards, 
library patrons will use a card 
with a magnetically encoded 
barstrip, similar to those in 
use at UCLA. Each book Will 
also have a bar code. Checking 
out a book would imply 
reqUIre running a magnetic 
reading deVice over the bar 
codes. 

machine readable tape are 
received from OCLC which 
can be utilized by BLIS. 

The total CO!;t of converting 
all library holdIngs to machine 
readable form is approxi· 
mately $900,000. Thus far , 
$465.000 has been spent. The 
CO!;t for BLiS IS approxtrnately 
$200.000. 
A number of ways art being 
sought to pay for BLIS, 
ranging from loans and monies 
from General Carr.pus Funds. 
to salary saving., derived from 
voluntary reductlOn of staff 
workmg hours and ~'o l untary 
leave without pay 

The proposal to generate 
fund:; from sala ry' ,a\"ings are 
still In the di .cusslOn ·tages. 
Salarie!; account for 60'1( of the 
library operating budget. 
There are 170 staff employee~ 
and 50 academic employees, 
with the average staff salary 
being $16,288 and the average 
academic sa lary being $28.137. 

By giving employees the 
oppurtunity to reduce their 
hours by 20%. to 32 hours a 
week. a great savings could be 
realized. If 25 taff and 25 
academic employees were to 
reduce their hours for one 
year. the projected savings 
would be $189,065. 

Response to these proposals 
by library employees has been 
favorable . by and large. 

Presently, guIdelines are being 
formulated to drtermine in 
what area s a temporary 
reduction in library personel 
can be earned out without 
affecting the level and quahty 
of lIbrarv services. 

Ao.; automation brIngs the 
future to l 'CSD's librarie~,::.o 
too Will the future be urought 
to Its employees and patrons. 
Computers are r apidly 
changing the work process In 
almost all kinds of work, in the 
:-.erVlCe sector, tn industry. 
and, of C'Jurse. in acadtml;]. 

Acco rdin g to Jackie 
Coolman, head of librarj 
pt'rsonel , "The ltbran' Will 
honor its commlttmenh to 
career staff cmplovee~." 
Automation wIll change 
virtually all aspects of hbrary 
work and with it, the skill and 
knowledge of its personcl 
Rather than a reduction tn 
staff ret raim ng will be tn 
order to fa cilitate the 
increased efficiency \\ h ich 
BLiS will bring about. 

The elimmatlOn of cha rge 
card files, as well as card 
catalogs Will enable work to be 
earned out in a variety of 
locatIOns. Within the next five 
years. 1t is conceivable that 
library research can be done 
from s everal terminal 
locations , in dorms , in offices. 
or even at home.

expo ed_ Barring that. they 
can ask their mothers about 
the possibility that they took 
DES during pregnancy. 

Even those not d irectly 
affected may suffer from 
exposure to DES. which has 
long been used as a growth 
stimulant in livestock . 

Alt hough it was banned for 
this use by the FDA in 1980. it 
remains a popular means of 
adding valuable pounds to 
marginally profitable animals. 

Wendi Horowitz. a Calfor-
nian whose mother took DES. 
expressed both the alarm and 
the exasperation medical 
professionals face when she 
said. "If you feel well insulated 
from DES and other potenti-
ally dangerous hormones. you 
may be deceiving yourself. 
DES has contaminated our 
meat and poultry supply as an 
animal feed additive and a 
pellet implant since 1954."

The cost of thIS latest

larger turnout and the 
techniques employed by

increasingly expert practi-

used a felt pen to black out the

people slept in the gym the

moved in following days to 
reduce crowding and those 
incidents brought forth more 
"passively resistant" 
confrontations with guard . 

In the days that followed, 
the VAC's volunteer attorneys

Softball: 2 
more L's 

By JOE FALLETTA 
Staff Writer 

Battered by the elements as 
well as by Division I hitting, 
the women of UCSD softball 
returned home -to Warren 
Field this week to playa six· 
game ho me stand (three 
doubleheaders) . The Tritons 
head for the road again after 
the final home doubleheader 
against UC Riverside at noon 
on Saturday. 

With more than half the 
games so far cancelled because 
of rain and whatever else has 
hit the state this year, the 
Triton record stands 1-10 
overall and 1·3 in conference 
play. The roster had dwindled 
to 10 with the departures of 
Val Hardie, Ceec Chisholm, 
and Julie Krause . Coach 
Colleen Wight says she has 
put out the word for 
reinforcements but has had no 
luck. Students either have 
class conflicts or say they 
would be unable to handle the 
team schedule, she says. 

Tuesday saw the Tritons 
drop a doubleheader to the 
Univer Ity of Redlands, 13·] 
and 3·2. On a day cold and 
windy enought to freeze the 
seams on the ball and with 
rain every few innings, a 
handful of regulars watched as 
Redlands fielders seemed to 
have Triton hitters program· 
med. Pam Hardaway had three 
sure extra base hits turn into 
long outs and Vanessa Davis 
had at least one shot do the 
same due to some fine running 
catches. Bloopers and hard 
shots headed for hits likewise 
found waiting golves. 

UCSD was not without Its 
share of defensive magic, 
however. as center fielder 
Linda Fogarty, third baseman 
JIll Keene, and shortstop 
Hardaway had Redlands 
hitters returning to the bench 
shaking their head more than 
once. Fogarty s hould be 
doing Mr. Coffee commercials 
before the year i' out if she 
keeps this up, took extra base 
from more than one Redlands 
hitter with leaping backhand· 
ed catches of long drives and 
one fine running grab of a 
Texas Leaguer about to drop 
for a hit in short center. 

Otherwise. two long drives 
got through for homeruns in 
the first game. Those, the ones 
that dropped in. and walks 
accounted for the 13 Redlands 
tallies The Triton run came in 
the first on a single by 
Williamson and a double by 
Hardaway. In the . econd 
game. UCSD garnered two 
runs O!1 anot her Williamson 
smgle, a throwing error that 
put Keene on, and a triple bv 
Grace Beari!>. . 

UCSD'sonewincameon the 
road against this same club 
last month. The Tritons 
collpcted nme hits including 
three 10 as many at bath by 
Pam Hardaway. Katie TruE' 
recorded the win. 

Redland ~ won the second of 
that doubleheader, ]()'3. 

At the Redlands Tourna· 
ment, s uperior hitting 
overwhelmed Triton pitching 
as UCSD lost to Whitt ier 
College, ]36, and to La Verne 
College. ] 0·0. 

"Both teams had good 
hitters," Wight says. "We 
didn't give up as many walks 
that time but that may be 
because they hit us so well. " 

In the meantime, William 
son has moved frl)m short to 
catcher as Davis s hares 
mound duties with True. 

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Staff Writers 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. The North Carolina 
State Wolfpack certainly is the cinderella team of 1983. Not since 
the Golden State Warriors upset the Washington Bullets (four 
games to none) to win the NBA crown in 1976 has there been as 
surprising a team as NC State. Jim Valvano did an outstanding 
job of coachin~during the tournament, changin~ his team's style 
of play to SUIt every <?p~nent. They ran against Nevada Las 
Vegas, shut down VlrgIma s Ralph Sampson, dominated Georgia 
on the boards in the semifinals, and slowed down the tempo 
when .neces~ary against Houston Monday night in the 
ChampIOnship Game. Rest assured, Valvano will have very little 
trouble recruiting for the years to come. It's nice to see a team 
other than Dean Smith's North Carolina Tarheels win from that 

~alent ·Iaden state. 
NOT TO BELIEVED DEPT. The Padres crushing the 
Giants by the score of 16-13 up in San Francisco. Steve Garvey 
and Co. should be awfully exciting this season if the pitching 
holds up. The ace of the staff, Tim Lollar, didn't exactly have a 
stellar performance: five innings, six runs. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. The Las Vegas odds men are 
losing their marbles. We can understand how they picked the 
New York Yankees to win the American League East at 3·1, but 
how could they list the Detroit Tigers at 30-1? Detroit is our 
sleeper to win baseball's toughest division. The Tigers have an 
array of young budding superstars as well as one of baseball's 
best starting rotations. If Manager Sparky Anderson can get 
anything out of his bullpen, Detroit will win the flag for the first 
time since 1972. 
COULD IT BE DEPT. Guardian Staff Writers Mike 
Greenberg and Jeff Savage placing $1,000 bets down on 50-I 
longshot North Carolina State three weeks ago towin the NCAA 
tourney.

Crews Race 
In Classic 
continued from page 7 
was the Copley Cup, which is 
responsible for drawing the 
top crews from across the 
nation to San Diego each April. 
This year, the UQiversity of 
Washington HuskIes domino 
ated the field, followed by the 
University of Victoria, UCLA, 
Yale, Cal, and Purdue. 

The San Diego Crew Classic 
in one of the few regattas in 
which both East and West 
Coast crews may compete 
against each other. There is no 
single national championship 
in collegiate rowing. National 
status is gauged upon a crew's 
performance in one of the four 
major rowing events: the 
Eastern Sprints, the Interna· 
tional Rowing Association 's 
Championships, the Western 
Sprints (in which UCSD 
competes), and the Pac 10 
Conference Championships. 
The Crew Classic f ield 
changes from year to year, but 
generally can boast a line·up 
comparable to one of these top 
events. However, the fact that 
it is held in early April , before 
East Coast crews can break 
through the ice on their rivers 
and lakes, gives the western 
shchool (primarily Cal and 
Washington) an undeniable 
advantage. 

Looking ahead to the just· 
opened racing season, the 
UCSD crews find themselves 
in a challenging and exciting 
position. Each crew has seen 
its competition for the season, 
and keeping this in mind, can 
train accordingly. 

The Triton rowers head 
north this weekend for a series 
of races at Redwood Shores 
near San Francisco. Included 
in the race schedule are Santa 
Clara, Humboldt , and St. 
Mary's.

said . "Swimming World had us 
ranked seventh and we knew 
we could do better than that. 
Division III is pretty well· 
developed , though, and the 
competition was a bit tougher 
than we first expected. But 
we're on the move, people 
know who we are, and with 
the new pool and recruiting 
both going well. we should do 
even better next year."

uncertain judgments we pass 
upon Zionism, for Zionis m by 
its own action has condemned 
itself to infamy for all times, 
more than Nazism did . The 
recent indiscriminate bomb· 
ing of Beirut, Lebanon, which 
resulted in the death of 
thousands of men, women , 
and children is clear evidence 
of the genocidal intent of 
Menachem Begin 's inherited 
designs, and, of course, that 
such actions subsume the 
Zionis t value of human life. 
These acts and others stem 
from the anti -humanitarian 
roots of t he Zionist theorist 
Theodore Hertzl, who wrote: 
"Universal brotherhood is not 
even a beautiful dream."

zen and the fine art of 
photography 

lfie;-San, Japan 

By CANOIL 
Emerging from a La Jolla misty morning 

fog, approaching the Photography Gallery 
one almost expects to see bamboo buddhist 
sandals neatly placed beside the entrance. 
For what lies within creates the same 
atmosphere of respect and appreciation a 
person could experience if they were to visit 
one of the Japanese Zen or Shinto temples 
presented so sensitively in Paul Caponigro 's 
photographs now on display till April 24. 

Most westerners who enter a Japanese 
temple are first taken by the simple 
elegance of the white rice paper walls 
bordered by black laquered bamboo. As a 
monk slides the paper partition aside, the 
room becomes a black and white frame for 
the graceful grey Zen garden beyond. 

Paul caponigro mirrors this experience 
by presenting his Japanese temple 
photographs framed within wide white 
matting, bordered in black. The wide 
surrounding space of the matting 
establishes a Sumi painter's oriental 
overtone of openess upon the tightly filled 
western style of photography caponigro has 
perfected. 

caponigro steps back and invites us to 
walk past the partition of his photograph 
into the temple garden. 

The grey raked ripples of sand 
surrounding a stone in a Zen garden 
represents waves on water. A single red 
cherry blossom falls upon these waves 
splashing its color into the foggy 
photograph. 

As a Japanese monk rakes the sand to 
capture a moment of movement, 
Caponigro 's camera freezes the monastery 
morning mist's brief lifetime into the 
eternal time of the photograph. 

The concept of Te in Ze and Shinto 
philosophy is a thing's essence, virtue, 
unique nature. The solidness and strength 
of stone, the ripples and reflectiveness of 
water, the fibers and flexibility of bamboo 
are their Te. 

caponigro's photographs are also the Te 
of stone, water and bamboo. His are not 
paper images of stone, they are 
photographic impressions seemingly 
struck into stone. The reflective surface of 
his photograph becomes a flshbowl 
containing colorful Koi within. And the 

Paul caponigro 

texture of his photographs are as touchable 
as polished bamboo or the pongy moss 
caressing a stone, I recently talked to 
Caponigro about his work and the ideas 
behind his images. 

Canole: Your images are as intriguing 
and mysterious as the Zen Koan . What is the 
sound of one hand clapping? ' or in this case 
the sound of one shutter opening. 
Paul Caponigro: The whole of life 
surrounds the clicking of a shutter, all of it, 
is always there. I have to try to include my 
life into my work, and not make it an 
isolated process, not make it precious or 
removed. So these photographs of Japan are 
nothing more than instants of my 
movement through life. 
c: The black and white tones and use of 
space in your photographs are similar to the 
simple quality expressed in Japanese Sum! 
and Chinese Taoist landscape paintings. 
PC: I prefer black and white because 
color is too closely associated with the 
reality of the object. With black and whlt~

When the Bus Boys opened 

for the Dlglish banet Jlladness. a 
few years ago, the lA-based 
stxtet was not greeted mvorably 
by their hometown. It could be 
passed off as a misunder-
standing; In mct. the Bus Boys 
have been misunderstood 
practically from day one. 

It Is hard for some to mthom a 
black group (drummer Steve 
.. ellx Is the only non-black 
member) that plays rock-and-
roll with a new-wave twist. Some 
black mcUons have accused 
them of "seiling ooL" With 
Inftuences as diverse as Stevie 
Wonder, AC/OC and the Clash, 
the band Is as original as they 
come. "I'm not worried about 
who we offend," says keyboard 
playa and leader Brian O'/'teal. 

1be Bus Boys two albums 
Amerlc:.n W~r and their 
debut Minimum W.ge Rock W 
Roll have received rave reviews 
from the critics, but did not ring 
the big bells at the record 
stores. The biggest break for the 
group came when they were 
asked to appear In the recent 
Walter HfII ftlm 48 "ours. As 
well as performing In the movie 
that !tarmI r.ddle Murphy and 
I'fJck /'tolte, the band recorded a 
few songs for the soundtrack. 

/'lot only are the Bus Boys 
mtertalnlng and talented, they 
have been Important In 
transcending the racial barriers 

In popular music. Along with 
such black artists as Michael 
Jackson and Prince, the band 
has opened the way for others 
on I'M radio as well as Music 
Television (MTV). 

The Bus Boys legacy dates 
back to O'Neal's days at 
Gardena High School In Los 
Angeles. Along with his younger 
brother Kevin, O'Neal formed 
the nucleus of the band that 
officially came together In 
1979. The line-up currently 

features vo c alist Gus 
louderman, Mike Jones on 
keyboards, Victor Johnson on 
guitar and drummer Steve I'ellx. 

Dressed In plain black suits 
and narrow ties, they support 
the good old-fashioned work 
ethic. As the back of their latest 
album declares "American 
workers. . .and damn proud oflt."

Woodstock 
film here 
Saturday 

Many of us probably 
remember the Woodstock Music 
Festival simply as a well-
attended event that occurred 
somewhere Back East in the late 
60s. But to those who are old 
enough to remember, and to 
those that were there, it meant a 
great deal more, 

Disillusioned by a meaning-
less war in Southeast Asia and 
turned off by the crass 
materialism of society, more 
than 400,000 people gathered 
on Max Yasgur's 600 acre dairy 
farm in Bethel, New York, not 
just to hear Jlml Hendrlx. Janis 
Joplin and others, but to see and 
hear each other in a joyous 
celebration of community. 

Although the conditions were 
ripe for mass rioting, i.e. lack of 
food and water, Inadequate 
sanitation, and two nights of 
rain that turned the site Into a 
sea of mud, there were no rapes, 
no assaults, no robberies, and as 
far as anyone can recall, not one 
single fight. Everyone shared 
what they had and it turned out 
to be enough. 

An Academy Award winning 
film was made about Woodstock 
capturing the spirit of the event 
and including the music of the 
Who, Santana, Crosby, Stills, 
Nash, and Young, the Jefferson 
Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, Janis 
Joplin and many others. 

Sponsored by the Recycling 
Coop, you can experience it this 
Saturday at 8:00 pm in TLH 107. 
Tickets are at the box office for 
$2.

Kronos highlight music series 
The Kronos Quartet. a youPg 

ebulllent ensemble, committed 
to discovering the past In the 
present and the future In 
tradition, will present a 
chamber concert on the 
Wednesday Evenings at the 
Mandeville Center series, that 
will make even the most passive 
listener an active participant in 
the performance, April 1.3. 8 pm. 

for those who ask. "Why new 
music?" the \Vonos Quartet 
provides the answer. "Their 
vitality. technical impeccability 

and penetrating insight into the 
complexities of modem music 
makes the unaccustomed as 
accessible as if it were 
Beethoven," according to the 
music critic of the frankfurter 
Zeitung. 

Capitalizing on the versatility 
of the string quartet medium, 
the Kronos Ensemble offers 
Quartet No, J Op. 19 by one of 
Finland's leading composers, 
Aulis Sallinen. Sallinen chose a 
popular finnish folksong to 
compose a work of cont inuous 

variations in which the theme 
would never disappear entirely. 

Mandeville will host 
Three's Company troupe 

The two most significant 
string quartets by two 
composers who made vital 
contributions to 20th century 
repertory, Elliot Carter's String 
Quartet No. 2 and Bartok's 
String Quartet /Yo, 4 add a 
different quality to the program. 
Carter. among the most 
respected composers i n 
America today, says about his 
work. '" regard my score as 
auditory scenarios, f o r 
performers to act out with their 
instruments, dramatizing the 
players as individuals and as 
participants in the ensemble." 

Bartok, whose musical 
speech was influenced by Asia 
and Africa. composed six string 
quartets . comparable to 
Beethoven's quartets in their 
encompassing breadth of 
vision. The String Quartet No. 4, 
to be heard on the Kronos 
program. is unique among 
Bartok 's works in structure and 
content. 

Three's Company and Dancers 
announces its programming for 
the final performances of its 
1982-8.3 season in San Diego 
which will take place this 
wee k end i n Mand evi lle 
Auditorium. 

The featured work of these 
performances will be Carolyn 
Wood's The f gg and I. a staple in 
the repertory of Utah Repertory 
Dance Theatre. The work, which 
has been restaged here by Ms. 
Wood for six performers to a 
score by Steve Reich. chooses as 
its central image the fragility of 
an egg. 

Making her first appearance 
as a featured soloist with Three's 
Company will be Dianne Brace-

Kennedy in Jean Isaac 's 
choreography, Two fo,,"s. 1\ 
massive welded steel sculpture 
by Louis Nidorf supports Ms, 
Brace-Kennedy in a series of 
elongated poses. Two forms 
premiered in 1981 and hassinee 
been seen in Los Angeles and 
Santa Maria. 

This concert wil l also feature 
the premiere of Jean Isaac's 
ffande/ Suite, a pure dance trio 
with humorbus overtones which 
is set to the Handel Suite #j in G 
M<\ior from The Water Music. 

The concerts will take place 
friday and Saturday at 8 pm. 
Tickets are at the box office. for 
more information call the box 
office at 452-4559. 

Finally, Joji Yuasa's piece 
Projection for String Quartet 
involves the principle by wh ich 
many sounds may be equated 
with one sound and vice v.ersa, 
as well as extended violin 
performance technique. 

. Admission to Wednesday's 
concert is $.3.50 general. and 
$1,50 students and seniors. for 
more information. call 452-

Zen and photographic aesthetics Concert Line 
continued from page 1 
you have a much greater 
opportunity to be abstract. One 
can have a tremendous 
influence over the space within 
the photograph. 

The stone steps in the 
photograph "Ayabe" are a very 
success ful image for me 
because the photograph comes 
close to the thinking of the 
eastern mind. The Japanese 
diminish the perspective. not 
because they do not understand 
it or do not know how to use it. 
'but they wish to bring order into 
a frame. to incorporate very 
definite feelings and ideas. 

I love the idea that those 
stones are literally floating on a 
dark ground, The steps are not a 
sequential foreground to 
background idea. Therefore it 
brings you much closer to the 
idea that man is trying to get 
across. He is trying to make a 
path somewhere. And if it is on 
sacred ground. where is that 
path going?" 
C: These photographi c 
mirrors of your Japanese 
experiences are without human 
images. 
PC: It is what people do that 
draws my interest. thus they do 
not need to be included in the 
photograph for my purpose. You 
will observe nature interests me 

far more. It is so direct; It is so 
there. It takes a lot for human 
beings to be as there as nature. 
and that direct. Especially 
during this age. We are just too 
complex . I want so me 
simplicity. Not that you cannot 
find it. but you have to look 
pretty hard to get it. 
C: This exhibition contains a 
oneness. an effortless now 
between the prints and also a 
constant changing of images. 
PC: My approach is to leave 
things alone and allow myselfto 
experience them. Nature is an 
ever continuously flowing 
something. All I have to do is be 
there. And there is always 
something new presented to 
me. None the less. it is rooted in 
one great substance. So there is 
not anything new except the 
amazing aspect of its ever 
changi ngness. 

It was a delight to see the way 
the Japanese handled It. They 
somehow managed to take the 
principles functioning in 
nature. and no matter how sma 11 
an area they put it into, they 
could capture these principles 
and feelings of nature without 
making it seem manicured or 
overly ordered like western 
gardens. 

The Japanese garden holds an 
essence from nature. This is

what was so astonishing to me. 
so unique to the Japanese. They 
take nature from the great space 
and put it in a small area 
without losing this essence. 

"Spanish Sinatrall here 
Bv JOHN Nff 

While caponigro opened his 
camera eye to record these 
images of Japanese sacred 
grounds. he obviously opened 
himself to the way of estern art. 
for he too has taken nature 
from the great space and put it 
into the small area of a 
photograph without losing its 
essence. 

As far as male vocalists go, 
the idea of an ability to sing 
seems to be. more often than 
not. overlooked. Many 
"entertainers" make very grand 
efforts to the end of being 
singers but these efforts are 
usually made in vain because 
music is just not their genre of 
entertainment. 

For instance. we could use 
someone like Burt Convey as an

;" 

example. There is no reason in 
the world why Convey should 
ever pick up a microphone and 
sing. but he does and people 
listen He has a burning desire 
to sing. The difference between 
a Burt Convey and someone like 
Frank Sinatra or Perry Como is 
just that the latter are much 
better. They. too, have a kind of 
burning desi re but their 
expression of this desire is 
much more justified. 

In any case. the chance to 
view a vocalist of the caliberofa 
Frank Sinatra in a live 
performance is rare.Julio 
Iglesia, who is considered to be 
the "Spanish frank Sinatra," 
will be playing in San Diego this 
Friday. Having just released his 
first album on an American 
label. Iglesia is embarking on a 
tour of the United States. 
Having the ability to sing in 
English, Spanish, and German, 
Iglesia has gained an amazing 
following in Europe and Latin 
America. His recent shows in Las 
Vegas last weekend were all 
complete sellouts as well as 
artistic successes. Iglesia will

6) THE BALCI( STAWON 
RETURNS 

By CLYDfl'tf I'tlf 
The King of Comedy has to be 

one of the most misleading HIm 
titles to come out of Hollywood 
for some time. Yet. as the 
product of the combined efforts 
of director Martin Scorsese and 
actor Robert De Nlro, whose 
past efforts together have 
included Taxi Driverand Raging 
BUll, It Is probably one of the 
finest films that you will see this 
year. 

This film is a dramatic 
comedy that surrounds the 
efforts of Rupert Pupkin, an 
extremely off-balanced 
individual who would like 
overnight success as a stand-up 
comic and become the new 
"King of Comedy." His ambition 
is to do his routine on the Jerry 
Langford Show, a late night talk 
show hosted by Jerry Langford, 
who is portrayed expertly by 
Jerry Lewis making his dramatic 
debut. Rupert and his friend 
Marsha, played by Sandra 
Bernard, devise a plan to kidnap 
langford and hold him for 
ransom. Ruperts demand Is to 
have 10 minutes on the Jerry 
Langford Show. Marsha 's 
desires are more simplistic, 
dinner for two, during which her 
sexual overtures are incredibly 
frightening, 

The remarkable thing about 
this fllm is the imagery that 
Scorsese evokes in some of 
Rupert's fantasies, He takes 

scenes that are surrealistic, and Mark David Chapman and John 
I'liects cold harsh reality Into Hinckley show us exactly how 
them from the viewpoint of the far some people go to get close 
aUdience, In one scene he Is to the famous. Individuals like 
telling Jokes to a wall painted Rupert and Marsha will go to any 
with a crowd of people extremes to get Jerry Langford, 
laughing: and as the camera and through this brush with the 

Robert De !'flro and Jeny Lewis In the new film "The King of Cornedv" 

pulls back, the imagery shows 
to a greater extent how far from 
rea lity Rupert is, 

The film also treads on the 
shaky ground of fan obsessions 
with famous people, People like 

famo us they themselves 
consider t hat they are famous, 

Andy Worhol predicted that 
by the end of the century 
everyone will have been famous 
for five minutes,
