Officially, little has changed in 

terms of TGs and alcoholic 
beverage company sponsorship of 
university events, yet the policy 
revisions mandated by Dr. joseph 
Watson, Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs, have raised 
questions as (0 the degree of 
revenue campus organizations can 
bank on. This is because the 
revised regulations limit the degree 
of recognition organizations can 
give companies associated with 
the alcohol industty. 

With the exception of two 
minor changes in the wording of 
the policy recommendations, set 
forth by the Alcohol and Substance 
Abuse Committee (ASAC), Watson 
accepted the findings of the 
student, administration and 
faculty members.

The policy recommenda~ions

Dr. john Giebink, Assistant Vice 
Chancellor, Student Development, 
explained the policy reviSIOns are 
meant· to prevent prImary 
recognition of alcoholic beverage 
companies on banner , flIers and 
other good associated with a

Fox negotiates for rights to 
UCSD novelist 's book 

Alice McDermott's hIghly acclaimed 
new novel. ThaI Nigh!, published by 
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, so richly 
captures the dream of rwo teenage 
lovers growi ng up in suburban Long 
Island that 20th Century Fox and 
Harper and Row have already negotiated 
for fIlm and paperback rights, 

McDermott, a 33-year old ViSiting 
lecrurer in the Department of Literolture , 
said the storyline for Tha! Nighl kept 
cropping up while she was in the 
process of writing her second novel. "I 
put the other story on hold in order to 
let ThaI Nigh! come through ," she said . 

The story that wouldn't leave her 
alone is about Sheryl and Rick, twO 
teenagers who fa ll III love dunng the 
early 1960s. Sheryl becomes pregnant 
and is sent away to live wilh a relative 
until th e baby is born , Rick comes to 
claim her out of exile, resulting in a 
Violent scuffle involving Rick and a 
group of his hood fnends against 
Sheryl's father and some male neighbors, 

Book critic Richard Eder has said 
McDermott's perceptions of suburban 
hfe "have a rich detail with the quality 
of a Cheever or an Updike," 

Ga ll Caldwell of the Boston Globe has 
said. "For the kids who came of age

McDermon's first novel, The 
Bigamist's Daughter, also met with gOr)d

Raised in Elmont, Long Island , 
McDermOtt said she based the Story of 
Rick and Sheryl on an II1cldent she had 
heard while growing up. The author 
attended Sacred Heart Academy 111 
Hempstead , Long Island , received her 
bachelor's degree from Oswego State 
University of New York, and received 
her master's degree from the UniverSity 
of New Hampshire. McDermott will

five months, 

Accordmg to hiS lal'",),er, Fitzgerald

University lawyers denied any liability 
in the settlement which was reached 
after discussion before Orange County

team of molecular biologists , 
Virologists and immunologists at 
Scripps Clinic to delermine what

The genetic aspects of the AIDS 
virus are also belllg explored by 
researchers at the neighboring Salk 
Institute. [n an interview, Dr. 
Walter Eckhan, Faculty Chair at 
the institute and head of the 
molecular biology and virology lab, 
said the area of study at Salk is not 
the virus itself, but rather how the

"The ViruS IS able to grow III certain

olullon to the problem of the 
homele s could be COSt dfe lIve-
and it may nor be as complex as 
some have perceived 

Ince the plight of the homeless 
IS In a dlsasterous state. why not 
find ways and means to declare It a 
national disaster and obtain 
Immediate aid' After all. If a few 
hundred Victims of noodIng and 
OIher disasters could be eligible for 
assistance at all levels. a dl aster of 
thiS magnitude should be also 
ehgtble 

All the resources that have been

nor limited to. the de emralizers of 
the Mental Health ystem, ought to

problem for the private sector as

Repaid but not redeemed 
By PETER QUERCIA 

The odyssey of the garbage scow cartying the hundred tons of New 
York City filth IS over It will be dehvered and dumped at the SIte I[ was 
OrigInally Intended to go - a massive landfill near IslIp, Long Island . 

Also ended IS the odyssc)1 of the paroled mutilation-rapist , Lawrence 
ingleton , the man nobody seemed to want living in their neighborhood. 

Stngleton, who had been shipped up and down the state under 24-hour 
armed guard since his release from the California Men 's Colony at Sa:1 
LUIS ObiSpo on April 25, hasat last found a home - unbeknownst to local 
residents in the general area he was supposed to have been delivered 
somewhere in northem California. But that may change again if the 
media or public b lows his cover, says a Department of Correcnons 
spokesperson. Without a good plastic surgeon, ii's going to be impossible 
to aSSimilate Smgleton Into a ommunity anywhere in the tate. 

Singleton had owned a home in Contra COSt County in 1978 when he 
raped, cut off the foreanns , then left for dead a IS-year old girl. The crime 
was committed in Stanislaus County but because of the sensational 
aspects of Singleton'S offenses, the trial was transferred to the distant 
county of San Diego, where he was subsequently convicted to the 
maximum penalty pennined under state law at that time for the crimes of 
attempted murder. kidnapping, rape and mayhem. Thatwas 14 years ago, 
but because of rules already in place as Singleton moved through the 
system, he earned early release, which transpired into eight years and 
four months, after conSidering good behavior, work time while in prison, 
and accumulated "good time" served while awaiting the outcome of trial. 

The overshadowing issue , however, gradually became whether 
Califomla counties have the legal right to restrict or outright banish 
certai n people from living in communities located in those counties. San 
Diego, Stanislaus, Alameda, apa, Mendocino, Kern, Contra Costa and 
San FranCISCo counnes, among Others, and presumably aU of the state's 58 
counties, did or could have successfully explOited the publicity 
surrounding this case and been able to block admittance to the paroled 
man through whipped up public pressure exerted on the sta te. 

Indeed , "The importance of this decision ," State Deputy Attorney 
General Morris Lenk pointed out, "is that we will not be faced with the 
situanol1 in the future where [a person] is literally banished from aU 
counties In the state, putting the state in the unseemly pOSition of having 
to dnve him around without a safe haven."

Credit denied 
Editor. 

The students of UC D have 
been denied the opportunity to 
open a student owned and 
operated credit union on campus. 
The University Federal Credit 
Union (UFCU) OrganiZing 
Committee feels the deci Ion was 
nawed In many ways. Although the 
concept of a student credit union 
has carried much excitement and 
enthUSiasm of the student body, it 
has faIled to muster eqUivalent 
support of the administration The 
admlntstranon's reaction would be 
understandable 
• If the UFCU had not assured 
protecuon of its member's dollars 
and It<; Il1vestment actions with the 
most comprehenSive Insurance 
package 111 the mdustry, 
• If In the UFCU's attempt TO 
satisfy operanonal considerations, 
It did not retaIn an advisory 
manager with over 40 years of 
experience 111 the credit union 
busmess, 
• If a survey did not show thaI 38 
percenr of the student populauon 
wanted to JOin a student credl[ 
unton.

• if the U FCU did nOt plan to offer 
services tailored to students' 
needs, such as loans for textboks 
computers, housing, registrano~ 
fees , and Guaranteed Student 
Loans as well as cash on campus, 
Amencan Express ServIces and 
notary service, to name a few. 

Despite the fact that all of these 
concerns were addressed m a 
manner superior to any of the 
other 14 successful student credit 
untons, pnor to their establish-
ment, the above were listed as 
reasons for denial. 

This letter is addressed to all 
students, not as a means to vent 
our anger from a project denied , 
but to reaffirm our commitment to 
th e s tudent cre dit union 
movement at UCSD. The 
admintstration stated that thi s is 
not the time nor the place for a 
student credit union. The Sltuanon 
necessitates student support to 
impress upon the administration 
the desire for a credit union . There 
WIll be pe titions on campus (co-
ops, bookstore , etc .) and much 
more infonnanon about oureffons 
available to students. Additionally, 
we invite you to investigate the 
UFCU and determine its viabilIty. 

Copies of our bUSIness plan are on 
ftle at the Humanities Library. 

In any university's history, 
Significant change reqUired effons 
greater than those anticipated . In 
view of the extensive preparations, 
we feel that now is the time and 
UCSD is the place for a student 
credIt union .

Editor: 

In response to the letter from 
Alina Kulikowski. which appeared 
in the May 14 editlon of the 
Guardian. I am surprised that 
inaccurate information was 
published . laurel Dean's position 
of Coordinator for Recreation 
Clubs was reduced two years ago, 
In 1985. Ms, Dean agreed to a 50 
percent reduction in her 
Recreation Clubs pOSition , and 
since that time her assignme nt at 
that position has not changed. 
Moreover. for the coming year her 
Recreation Clubs coord mator 
pOSition will not be reduced . 

With reference 10 why no 
student input was requested on 
this issue . si nce [here was no 
change in Ms, Dean's position as 
Recreation Club coordi nator. there 
was no reason to seek student

Morning to midnight 
Parking shuttle near approval 
By PEllR MESSROBlAN. ASSOCiate News Editor 

The plans for a parking shultle 
that will be making trips every 15 
minures from 7 am 10 12 midnight 
from the unfinished Third College 
overflow parking lot to the 
Mandeville Center awaits only Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs Steve 
Relyea's approval before it is put 
into effect next yeaL 

The Draft Proposal. dated June 
2. 1987. reads: "Based upon [he 
creation of the new parking lot 
northwest of Third College. and 
the subsequent assignment of 
Resident Student Parking in that 
lot . here is a proposal for a 
Resident Parking Shuttle .. ," and 
describes the shuttle plan. which 
will use one 25-person shuttle 
running from Monday to Fnday, 

The estimated cost of the bus IS 
$40.000. and the operating budget 
is projected at $5 ,092 per month . 
or $45.828 per mne-month school 
yeaL 

While the shuttle is described as 
a Resident shuttle . both the l,JOO-
space lot and the shu[[le may be 
used by both reSidents and 
commuters. according to 1987-88 
ASSOCiated S[udents (A.5. ) 
President Dave Marchlck "It's not 
only going to be a reSident parkll1g 
shuttle. it's going to be for anybody 

Marchlck nOted that reSidents 
Will probably be reqUired to park 
further out . which was one reason 
for the creation of the shuttle, 
"Residents are going to have to 
park at more peripheral lots. than 
[atl the close .,. lOIS, ow the only 
campus that this impacts greatly is 
on Muir. because you ei[her park in 
Muir or you park in North Third 
Lot [now under construction!. so 
that's quite a distance," 

He added that because of a new 

lot being built behind the Warren 
Apa rtments . and the close 
proximity of large parking lOts to 
both Revelle and Third Colleges. 
"Muir is a separate situation and 
they're going to consider that 
separately," The result of that 
consideration will be. If all goes 
well. rolling back and forth from 
the north end of the campus to the 
middle 17 hours a day. five days a 
week. next school year, 

who parks in that lot. or anybod y AoS- President Dave Marchick helped push the shuttle plan through.

Come one, come all 
By AIMEE DALZEll 

Picture women m long pastel 
dresses, weanng fash ionable hat 
designs from Pans strolhng arm In 
arm with knlcker-clad gentlemen. 
Children immersed in play dan In 
and out of pens occupied by 
prized livestock while yards away 
IS a tempting aroma of freshly 
baked bread . One would expect to 
fi nd these Images at a ountry fa ir 
of one hundred years ago. Since 
then, the nor ion of a fa ir has gone 
through numerous changes, but 
sull has nor lost the carnival-like 
ar.nosphere that affects everyone 
who passes th rough the fair gates 
The Del Mar Fair IS no exception 

Ted Bear, the assistant manager 
for media relations say the Del 
Mar Fair IS umque because, -It IS 
the only falf located nght near the 
ocean wh ich creates a pleasant 
atmosphere for everyone dunng 
the honest summer months. June 
and July." It IS also unusual because 
It IS held near the Del Mar 
Racetrack. Even though the Fair 
and the Racetrack are located on 
the same grounds they act 
independently of each other. The 
Track opens shortly after the fair IS 
over. It is also divorced from the 
fair in another way as the track IS 
rented out by the mdependent 
Thoroughbred Club, whereas the 
state is the sole sponsor of the Fair. 

The Del Mar Fair originated one 
hundred and seven years ago and 
has grown to be the second largest 
in Southern California , next to the 

L.A County Fair. Formerly known 
as the San Diego COUnty Fair, the 
first fair took place in National 
City. It changed locations every 
year but stayed WIthin the county 
limits, until 1936, when, due to the 
efforts of actors Bing Crosby and 
Pat O'Bnen, who advocated the 
Fair's settlement, the county fair 
found a home base In Del Mar. At 
the begmning, the Del Mar Fair 
was pnmarily an agricultural event 
where farmers used to show their 
best stoc k and women d isplayed 
home-made con fecti o ns . Two 
large tent s enclosed the entire 
fes tival but as time we nt on the fa ir 
e xpanded and gre w more 
contemporary. 

LaSt year the Del Mar Fair 
welcomed an aUlhem:e of 840,000 
for Its fifueth anniversary. The 
operation manageme nt expects 
eve n more people thiS yea r and has 
been preparing this year's fair long 
In advance. 

What's in store for fa irgoers in 
198?? The fair's slogan, -It's all for 
You!" gives a basIC glimpse of 
what's coming in June. Over one 
hundred and fon y rides, games 
and exhibits will make up this 
year's gala. The newest additions to 
the fair are: the Log Aume Ride, 
which is acrually a water slide 
similar to the ones at Knott's Berry 
Farm; the elephant ride; Iceskating 
and laser light shows; and an 
aerospace exhibit put on by ASA, 
Visitors can even have a souvenir

and the former deals With the 
details of construc tion. 

All fair wo rkers are government 
employees for the state of 
California . The rides are organized 
under the Fair managers , not by 
outside companies , However, 
there are independent entre-
preneurs who set up games and 
exhibits. These are chosen on the 
basis of response from previous 
fairs , or good impressions of the

Frisbee fetchin' dogs Farber honored 
By D. HERZ, -laff Wnler and EVAN OLSON 

Every dog has his day, but 
apparently Saturday wasn't the one 
for UC D's quaSi-official dog 
Frisbee -catching representative. 
Potter , rhe school ' s only 
representative , placed a close 
twenty-fifth Out of a field of twenty-
five at the Gaines Cycle Ashley 
Whippet Invitational for disc-
catching dogs held last Saturday at 
Robb Field in Ocean Beach , 

Hosted by the San Diego Parks 
and Recreation Department and 
sponsored by the makers of Gaines 
Cycle dog food , the competition 
displayed the Frisbee catching 
prowess of San Diego's finest 
canines. Although this contest was 
merely a preliminary for the 
regional tournament to be held 
August fifteenth , the competition 
was fierce as all the competitors 
took the tournament seriously, 

Potter was perhaps the only 
exception. Faced with opponents 
with names like Orca, Noogies and 
the top-ranked Spirit , Potter 
buckled under the pressure 
turning in a sub-par performance 
for any normal dog, 

In the basic throw and catch 
competition Potter managed a 
meager zero, refusing to chase 
down even a single disc . UCSD 
team coaches foresaw a poor finish 
right from the stan when on the 
first throw Potter decided to break 
for nature rather than the disc. 
Revelling in the unforeseen 
attention drawn by his first 
movement , Potter found that 
refusing to chase the disc was more 
appealing than the rewards his 
amletic prowess has draWn in me 

past. The judges were unmoved by 
his cute lackadaisical manner and 
scored h'im appropnately . 
However, his thrower was credited 
with four points for retrieving the 
ignored discs on his own. 

Potter's attitude was nor 
con tagious however as orher 
contestants performed to the best 
of meir abilities. In the Throw and 
Catch Competition , Lucky, a 
three-year-old collie, tied for the 
high score with eighteen points, 
Scoring was based upon the 
distance of the throw and the dog's 
ability to make mid-air catches. 
Owner Jeff Lundberg said , "The 
first time I entered Lucky in a 
competition he finished dead last. 
Now he does much better." 

Lundberg, denying allegations 
his dog ever Indulged in steroids: 
quickly claimed that "a lot of it is 
how well you throw the diSC ," he 
soon added that Lucky began his 
training at the age of mree months. 
This dedication paid 01T in the end 
as Lundberg and his dog placed 
third overall. 

After the hotly contested first 
round Lucky was tied with two 
dogs, one named Spirit and one 
named Noogies. However, in the 
physically demanding Freeflight 
round, Lucky could not keep up 
with the other two, In this round 
contestants are allowed ninety 
seconds to display their disc-
catching talents. Judging was 
based upon the showmanship, 
consistency, leaping ability , and 
degree of ditTiculty of each throw 
by the owner tl) the dog.

T HE UCSD Department of Visual Arts (VA) presents the 5th annual Under-
graduate Arts Festival. ThiS 
year's exhibllion , which began 
on May 27 and extends to June 
6 is dedicated to Visual Arts 
Professor, Manny Farber. 

Farber teaches graduate and 
undergraduate courses on 
paintlOg, film history and 
cnucisms, He joined the VA 
Department In 1970 and will be 
leaving UCSD thiS year. Farber 
has pursued dual careers as a 
film critic and painter since 
1941. Before Joining UCSD he 
served as the film critic for n : 
New Republic , The Nation , Time 
magazine , The New Leader, 
Cavalier and Artjorum , Since 
1975, he has written in 
collaboration with Patricia 
Patterson , associate professor of 
VA, and their work has been 
pubhshed pnmarily 10 City 
Magazine and Film Comme,lI . 

As a prolific painter, Farber IS 
represented by the OK Harris 
Gallery in New York and he has 

It was in this round that oogies 
and Spirit outdistanced Lucky in 
scoring. Spirit was by far the most 
entertaining performer of the day, 
performing mic!:air 360 degree 
turns and over-the-back catches. 
However, through the second 
round Noogies' quickness and 
agility allowed her to maintain the 
pace set by Spirit. At the end of 
regulation time both dogs were tied 
for the overall lead with forty-four

regular basis. A retrospective of 
hiS painting was held at the La 
Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art in 1978. His work has been 
reViewed most recently 10 An in 
America and Arts Magazine . 
Every year the Undergraduate 
Art Festival is ded icated to a 
patron of the arts, and thiS year 
the planning committee chose 
to honor Farber, 

The Festival was fo unded by 
Dr. John Stewart , the founding 
proVOSt of MUir College , and 
represent s five disci plines: 
theater, music , literature , dance 
and Visual arts . The 
undergraduate advisor for VA, 
B,] . Barkley , and head 
chairperson , Victor Chayet, 
began planning the festi val the 
fourth week of winter quarter. 
"This year's festival is WIthout a 
doubt the biggest yet ," stated 
Chayet. A reason for the growth 
is due to the festival being an 
unjuried show . " Every 
submission is shown, therefore , 
non-visual arts majors are 

points forcing a tie -breaker round . 
Both dogs were tired from the 

previous rounds causing both to 
turn in personal s ub-par 
perfomances In the tie breaker. 
The judges voted Spirit the winner. 

Spirit'S owner, Reed Ferguson , 
avoided reporters after the match 
but was overheard to say, "It was 
real close , The wind was a real 
factor here . But we JUSt went OUt 
and did the best we could ."Due to 

Manny Farber 
-bnnging work in. 0 one ever 

said the VA majors have a 
mo n o poly on c rea ti vllY ," 
Chayet said The VA 
department is trying to bring 10 
the self-motivated arti st. 

The festival exhibits include 
video, film , photo, sculpture , an 
all student show and a senior 
show. 

For times and listing of the 
remaming events, schedules are 
placed around campus. The 
festi val olTers the most Visible 
time for artists to show their 
work, however, exhlblls are 
ongOing throughout the school 
year. ~ 

his outstanding performance in 
Saturday's competition, Spirit is 
expeCted to fare well in the 
regional competition in August and 
stands a good chance of 
proceeding to the Far West finals 
to be held at half time of a Charger 
football game on the same day, 

UCSD's Potter, on the other 
hand , has withdrawn from all 
further competition for this year 
due to inadequate training. ~

Tritons eliminated in two

would have been able to relax a 
little more and have a little more 
onfidence In themselves to make 

the dtfference ," saId Yates. 
Secondly, the TritOn season 

(mcluding playoffs ) concluded on 
May 16, almost two weeks before 
the Senes began. All other teams 
continued their season through 
the weekend JUSt before the bIg 
event . "We had plenry of practice 
and intrasquad games, but that's 
not the same kind of competition 
that they faced in the World 
Series ," explained Yates. 

However, UCSD still made it 
known to the DiviSIon III teams 
that they were a team to be 
reckoned with . "We have nothing 
to be ashamed of," claImed Yates. 
"The team battled through some 
tough ball games and had a 
fantastic season . I believe we can 
hold our heads high and look to 
next year." 

Looking back on this year, the 
TritOn team boasted theIr best 
record ever at 32-12. atal and 
Nowak were named first team all-
Americans , the first time ever the 
team has had su h an honor. 
Coach Yate was selected as the 
NCAA Division III Western RegIOn 
Coach of the Year. atal nearly 
owns the Tritons' offensive record 
book with tOP numbers in batting 
average, home runs , runs batted in 
and total bases Nowak set his own 
team records of innings pitched, 
strikeouts and victOries - and he's 
only a sophomore! 

The only problem: seven starters 
will be graduanng thiS year, 
tncluding atal, who after 
graduation will be joining the 
Montreal Expos organization after 
being drafted last week. Any hope 
for a repeat? Yates believes so. 

• Absolutely! Along with those 
seven seniors , we also have eight 
freshman who enjoyed this World 
Series year, plus three more who 
were either mjured or redshirted. 
Besides, we 'll lose only one starting 
pitcher. If those guys come back 
with that winning attitude and we 
get the recruits we're looking for, 
we should be right back there next 
year."

By MIKE HORELICK, Staff Writer 

"Man, I really hate not being champion." 
- Boxer George Foreman 

after a loss to Muhammad Ali 
To many men , boxing is the purest of all sports. In boxing(which 

many consider to be) the ultimate test of a man's character, 
strength , and courage , luck is not a factor. One man's love for the 
sport resulted in the opening of the Fifth Avenue Boxing Club ten 
years ago, and the club has remained an oasis for aspiring fighters 
in a city better known for beaches and surfing than boxing. joe 
Lopez, whose club is tucked away on Fifth Avenue in downtown 
an Diego , fought as an amateur in the army in the 50s. Lopez, who 

can often be found with a hammer in hand as he tries to improve 
the club's interior, manages the gym and teaches the basics of 
boxing to eager beginners. 

Inside the club, a feeling of nostalgia pervades for this sport that 
produced champions like joe Louis and Muhammad Ali and 
captured the interest of intellectuals such as Ernest Hemingway and 
George PlimptOn . The Interior looks like a boxing club should . 
Yellowed boxing posters are plastered to the walls which surround 
punching bags (both light and heavy) , an archaic ring, and mirrors 
for shadowboxing. All teaching in the club is done on an individual 
basis as the trainers give boxers personal instruction. 

In one comer of the gym, professional boxer Fernando Ambriz 
punishes a bag with a flurry of jabs, crosses, uppercuts and hooks. 
The amiable Ambriz says that he likes boxing because "it keeps me 
from stayi ng out too late ." Fernando gets paid around $350 a fight; a 
small sum considering the amount of preparation required for a 
single bout. 

Ambriz is only one of 15 professionals that train in joe's gym. In 
addition , around 20 more members fight on the amateur level. The 
owner Lopez does not believe in th rowing beginners into the ring to 
spar (fighting with protective headgear and heavily padded gloves) 
because that can discourage young fighters. Instead , Lopez starts 
potential boxers out with the basics of boxing . ' We stan out young 
boxers with the jab, slipping, and countet ing. Later, we spar: Lopez 
explained . (Sli pping refers to the skill of avoiding punches, and 
countering allows a fighter to strike back at an opponent after 
avoiding a punch.) 

Lopez sees the boxing he teaches as an effective form of self-

Owner Joe Lopez, helping two 
aspiring contenders with moves. 

than Muhammad Ali. 
Many say boxing is an 

addic tion, and a good example of 
this phenomenon is ex-boxer and 
current trainer Stewan Darden. 
Darden is currently a trainer at the 
club which he desc ribes as "nu~ero uno." At one point, 
Darden was a successful 
professional boxe r with a record of 
15 victories in 17 fights WIth one 
draw. He was earning $1 ,200 a 
fight before he was forced out of 
the ring with an injury. As a former 
profeSSional, he doesn't try to mask 
the ultimate goal of profeSSIOnal 
boxing. He ~xplained , "You'r: 
trying to hun hIm I the opponent]. 
Darden believes that the deSIre to 
win is one of the most important 
vi rtues a boxer needs. 

Without showing bitterness, 
because of an injury which ended 
his career, Darden enJoys helping 
young fighters attempt to reach a 
goal which eluded him. The 
charismatic Darden , who has an 
answer for everythmg. seems to 
have found another way to satisfy 
his deSIre for boxing. 

In the near future ,Joe Lopez hJS 
deCIded to add a new program to

Spectacular summer season 
With the goal of making the 

La Jolla Playhouse "the 
leading research and 
development theater center in 
America," it's no surprise that 
the dynamic Des McAnuff 
was chosen to lead the 
reopening of the Playhouse in 
1982. The original Playhouse 
first opened in 1947 and 
remained open until 1967. 
After enduring a lengthy dark 
period, interest in the theater 
was revived in the early 
1980s, and the theater Board 
of Trustees formed a search 
committee to find "an artistic 
director with a vision." 

When he was first called in 
New York to discuss the idea 
of rebuilding the theater 
McAnuff had little interest in 
the project but agreed to meet 
with the Trustees merely as a 
favor. He then outlined his 
dream for a "progressive 
theater of world class 
distinction that had no 
prejudice to genre." The 
Board liked what it heard, and 
McAnuff set out to create his 
dream theater. 

One strategy that seems to 
have paid off for the theater is 
the method of choosing plays. 
Whereas in many other 
theaters, the directors and 
actors are fitted to the plays, 
McAnuff says that at the 
Playhouse the main approach 
to choosing a play is that the 
directors or writers are asked 
what they would like to do, 
and then the theater does its 
best to accomodate everyone. 
This way, says M cAnuff, the 
Playhouse gets "artists with 
passion and committment" to 
their work . U nder the 
guidance of McAnuff during 
the last four 'and a half years, 

by nancy muntner and john kearney 
the Playhouse has attracted 
artists such as Stephen 
Sondheim, James lapcne, and 
Billlrwin. 

The Playhouse also has a 
reputation for bringing novel 
and innovative plays to the 
stage. When asked whether 
commercial success may be 
more important than novelty, 
McAnuff replies that they are 
not necessarily different goals. 
There seems to be a prej udice. 
he says, a feeling that. 
"because something is 
innovative, it can't be 
popular." He goes on to say 
that since it is extremely 
difficult to predict, 
commercial success should 
not be a factor when choosing 
a play. Artistic value rather 
than ticket sales should be the 
primary motivation for 
producing a play. 

In the future, McAnuff 
hopes to continue choosing 
plays which will "explore all 
the legitimate American 
genres." He also hopes to 
bring leaders from various 
genres together . Some 
possible combinations might 
be Bill Irwi n and Rob 
Woodruff, or perhaps 
Stephen Sondheim and Bill 
Irwin. In this way. McAnuff 
sees the possibility of creating 
new dramatic styles. Also, the 
Playhouse will continue to put 
the content of the material 
first. showing work which will 
help the audien c e to 
comprehend the world in 
which they live. 

In addition to expanding 
artistically. there are plans to 
build two new theaters as well 
as some essential rehearsal 
space. McAnuff is also trying 
to la unch a profeSS ional 

touring theater for children in 
the winter months . He 
believes that this will offer 
children a new dimension to 
theater because most 
children's groups do not have 
the professional caliber of the 
la Jolla Playhouse . 

Although the Playhouse 
already maintains close ties 
with the UCSD Drama 
department , interested 
students are always encour-

aged to become involved. 
Anyone who is interested in 
the theater. says McAnuff, 
should " write us a letter!" By 
continuing this symbiotic 
relationship with UCSD as 
well as expanding on its own, 
the Playhouse is sure to 
become the dream theater that 
McAnuff envisioned four 
years ago.

Bordering on fun 
bv mike horelick 

There aren't many places in 
the United States where a 
foreign country is just a short 
drive away. UCSD is one of 
those few places, and the 
border through to Mexico is 
only about a 40 minute drive 
from campus. If you're bored 
of cruising the bars on 
Prospect in La Jolla, or if you 
simply want to duck under 
California's strict drinking 
laws, you might consider a 

nighttime trip south of the 
border. 

Recently, I drove down to 
Tijuana on a Saturday night 
with some friends to see for 
myself the difference between 
nightlife of Tijuana and the 
United States. After taking 
Interstate 5 south to the 
border, we elected to pay five 
dollars in order to leave our 
car in a guarded parking lot on 
the U .S. side. In addition, by 

walking over the border, you 
can bypass thL prolonged wait 
that people in cars must 
endure as they cross back into 
the U.S. 

After walking across the 
border, we encountered the 
infamous taxi drivers who 
appeared to be very eager to 
take us to the main street of 
bars and discos in Tijuana: La 
Revolucio' n. After some 
unsuccessful haggling, we 
agreed to pay the driver five 
dollars to take us to our 
destination . More experi-
enced hagglers may be able to 
get a taxi for less, but it takes 

time and mucho effort to 
achieve the smaller fare. 

Vitamins. 
Our next stop was Tijuana 

Tilly's, which is located right 
next to the Jai Alai bUilding. 
Unlike Mike's Bar, we had to 
wait in line for about 20 
minutes. The cover charge 
was a more costly two dollars 
and there was no band. Tilly' 
did offer decent margaritas, 
and that almost offset the fact 
that the dance floor was about 
the size of a postage stamp. 

- -- Goings on - ~ 

The first stop on our agenda 
was Mike's Bar. The cover 
charge, which included a live 
band called T/U> Impact, was 
only a dollar. Upon entering 
the bar, I had quite a 
revelation that disco was not 
dead. A giant mirrored ball 
hung over the dance floor . 
Multi-colored lights and 
strobes pulsed on and off to 
the beat of the band, which 
was actually not too bad. The 
dance floor was quite 
spacious, so I felt a lot like 
John Travolta. One aspect of 
the bar which was more than 
weak were · the drinks. My 
pina colada, which cost 
somewhere around three 
dollars, had that distinct taste 
of Flintstones Chewable 

After Tilly's, it was about 
three in the morniong, and 
being quite hungry we decided 
to get something to eat. Our 
choice was the pork taco stand 
in front of Leyva'S Paradise. 
The pork tacos, which only 
cost fifty cents each, were 
excellent and definitely one of 
the highlights of the trip . 

Don't miss this summer's 
hottest event, happening June

Cruisin' with the Bros. 
by aymee val~es 

First off, these guys aren't stories as to its origin. In one 
brothers. This foursome from L.A. Times interview they're 
Orange County isn't fooling quoted as saying that they 
anyone. And what about the derived the name from 
rest of their name, the Pontiac drummer D.A. (Dave) 
part? Well, they're notorious Valdez' Pontiac Indian 
for fabricating different ancestry. Another story 

claims that guitarist Ward 
Dotson (formerly of the Gun 
Club) and singer Matt Simon 
were one-time residents of 
Pontiac, Michigan. Yet 
another account has the group 
lifting the name from a 

Sutnlller cotnedy in store 
Girard Avenue in La Jolla is 

not known for its night life, 
but the Comedy Store, which 
is located off Girard at 916 
Pearl Street, is an unusual 
offering for those in search of 
a different type of night life 
entertainment. As with most 
people, I sometimes get in a 
rut as far as entertainment 
goes - just the usual dinner 
or movie. But since I have 
recently turned 21, I have 
been anxious to tryout all 
those forbidden places that I 
have now been deemed fit to 
gain admittance. 

Getting into the Comedy 
Store is a definite attribute of 
being a full~fledged, legal 
adult. While the cover charge 
($6 for week nights and $8 for 
weekends) and drink prices 
($3.75 for a mixed drink) may 
be a little more expensive than 

Border

by patty law lor 
other forms of entertainment, 
it is worth your while if you 
enjoy comedy or are just 
looking for something a little 
different to do. For those 
students who feel that the 
price is still a little steep, take 
heart, the Comedy Store has a 
2 for 1 student discount on 
Thursdays. 

The comedians who 
perform at the Comedy Store 
come from all parts of the 
country. While most of the 
comics are not nationally 
known, they are none the less 
very talented and funny. From 
time to time, big name comics 
such as Robin Williams or 
Rodney Dangerfield will drop 
by and perform. The shows 
usually last a couple of hours 
and feature three or four 
comedians. The type of 

comedy that is presented is 
different, and appeals to 
different types of humor. The 
night I was there, some 
comedians were sedate and 
sarcastic, while others relied 
more on a physical comedy 
for laughs. 

The feature that makes this 
type of entertainment dif-
ferent and fun is the active 
role that the audience takes 
on. People shout their 
comments to the performers 
on stage, which gives rise to a 
humorous bantering between 
the audience and comedian. It 
is this element that makes it an 
unusual and worthwhile 
evening. And for those of you 
who really enjoy the aspect of 
participation and are brave 
enough, can partcipate in the 
Comedy Store's amateur 
night on Sundays. 

The night life is pretty good 
in Tijuana in that people are 
out dancing until about five in 
the morning. Because of this, 
we decided to continue 
dancing. This time we went to 
Leyva's Paradise which, by 
this late hour, did not have a 
cover charge. This place 
would be seventh heaven to 
any law abiding disco lover. A 
mirrored ball turned slowly in 
the wall, and the sound system 
pounded out hits by Prince ,--------------------------' 
and the like. A major plus 
were the many wall fans which 
pointed directly at the dance 
floor and did a good job of 
cooling the dancers. 

Finally, we decided to call it 
a night at about 4:30 am, and 
took the taxi back to the 
border. It was quite a long and 
exhausting eveningi luckily, 
we didn't have to drive across 
the border - another friend 
told me later he waited two 
hours to cross. So, the night 
had been a success and the 
pork tacos certainly made the 
trip worthwhile.

The truth? Who knows. For 
the sake of intrigue, the guys 
like to perpetuate the 
mystery. 

Their mysterious back-
ground is about the o nly thing 
not genuine about the Brothers 
- Dotson, Simon, Valdez and

Otherwise, they're serious 
rock 'n' rollers, serious nice

unkind to say about the 
Brothers. 

The group just covered 
many ' miles and over 30 cities 
on a nation-wide tour 
promoting their last album, 
"Fiesta en la Biblioteca. " Says 
Bauman about the title, "It's 
the only Spanish I remem-
bered." Also recently released 
was an E.P. with an electric 
version of the love / hate 
ballad, "Be Married Song," 
and a resurrected "Dirty 
Deeds." Bauman said, "Well, 
we found some old eight-track 
cassettes and thought it would 
be fun. Plus, we were too 
chicken to do 'We Got Big 
Balls. '" 

The last leg of the tour 
included cities such as Boston, 
New Haven, Philadelphia and 
New York. While in New 
York they played the now 
infamous C.B.G.B.s, where 

the likes of the Police, the 
Clash and the Talking Heads 
first broke ground. Mostly, 
the Brothers say, they wanted 
to get back home to Fullerton 
in time for the N .B.A. 
playoffs. They also toured 
following the release of their 
second album, "Doll Hut." 
Simon growls big-time on a 
whole mess of originals on 
this one. Their first and 
loudest album, "Big Black 
River," is nearly impossible to 
find because it was released by 
the French label, Lolita. 
You're lucky if you own a 
copy 'cause it's a rip-rocking 
first attempt by the Brothers. 
It's got the straight-shooting 
"Straight and Narww" and 
Bob Dylan'S "If You've Got 
To Go." 

In the future they kind of 
want to rest up for a while 
before they go back to playing 
gigs. Their favorite nightspot 
is not-so-Iocal AI's Bar in 
downtown L.A. Probably, 
they'll be in San Diego soon. 
Hopefully, they won't play 
that ocher campus across town 
like they did a few months 
back. Preferably, we can lure 
them here to UCSD. 

Congratulations to Larry 
Weintraub for accu-
mulating the most points in 
the hiatus/ music trivia 
quiz! Thanks also to 
everyone who entered our 
contests throughout the 
year. Larry, please drop by 
the Guardian office on 
Friday at 3:00 pm for your 
mystery grand prize.

June 4, 1987 Hiatus 3 



Rich 
humor 
An energetic crowd gathered 

in Mandeville auditorium for a 
night of comedy last Friday, 
Rich Hall style. Hall is probably 
best known for his appearances 
on "Late Night" with David 
Letterman and his three 
volumes of "sniglets" (words 
which are overlooked by the 
dictionary). His performance 
included many of his skits from 
" Late Night," like his squid pelt 
jacket, his jacket made of a U .S. 
map, with of ourse , the 
matching hat With Alaska, and 
some fun with plexiglass. The 
show was also highlighted with 
audience participation.

Bell-bottom jeans , scruffy 
hair and amiable smiles 
d es c ri be C amp e r Van 
Beethoven. whose name is as 
nonsensical as the songs and 
musicians which form this 
group. The crowd came early 
to watch Camper play last 
Wednesday at the Che Cafe. 

Based in Santa Cruz, Ca., 
the five members have just 
"eturned from an East 
":oast/ European tour . The 

guitarist, Greg Usher said, 
"We did 55 shows in three 
months. We won't be touring 
again for a while. Our fourth 
record will be released in 
September. We like to parody 
other styles, from jokes to 
novelty music. For example, 
the song 'Good Guys and Bad 
Guys' is a joke. Some people 

took it seriously, but it 
doesn't make any sense!" 

Regarding the music, Usher 
said, "We mostly play ethnic-
type rock-and-roll with 
country, folk and psychedelic 
overtones. Each record is 
different. There's been a 
transition from the second 
record. None of that 'folksy' 
stuff." Members of Camper 
are David Lowry, guitarists; 
Jonathan Segel, vi o lin l 
key boa rd; Victor K ru -
menacher, bass; Chris 
Pederson, drums; and Usher, 
guitar. 

Camper made the "T op-
40" in England with their hit, 
"Take the Skinheads 
Bowling," and have also 
released a video of "Good 
Guys and Bad Guys." Usher

Future plans include a 
German release on the " Une 
Music" label in white vinyl

artwork, and a complete 
remix. Usher also revealed 
that Camper will record with 
Eugene Chadborn, a protest 
artist from N.C. who has 
worked with the Violent 
Femmes. It will be called 
"Camper Van Chadborn" 
and will be released in late 
August.
