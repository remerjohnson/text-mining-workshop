Lofgren finalist for influential 
UC Student Lobby position 

BY DEAN HAAS 
Staff Writer 

UCSD student Jim Lofgren 
has been named one of three 
finalists for the position of c0-
director of the UC Student 
Lobby. The co-director serves 
as a lobbyist for UC students 
in California's legislature. 

Lofgren, Execu ti ve 
Director of the Associated 
Students Internship Office, 
was selected a finalist after 
being interviewed Sunday by 
three members of the 
Student Body President's 
Council, the group which 
oversees the lobby's 
activities. 

Kristin Stelck, a Women's 
Studies/Political Science 

dou ble major at UC Berkeley. 
and Patricia Garrett, a 
Political Science major at 
UCLA, are the other two 
finalists for the co-director 
position. 

Lofgren said yesterday 
that he faced "tough 
competition" in the selP.c.tion 
process. He sees himself as 
the "underdog" in the final 
competition which takes 

pla~ this weekend at UC 
Irvme. 

Lofgren, a fifth-year senior 
majoring in History, has been 
involved in UCSD student 
government since 1977. He 
served as AS Commissioner 
of Appointments and

Committee J?lans 
adm'n rebUilding 

More power to students? 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

Aa.oclate News EcUtor 
A proposal to redefine 

areas of responsibility in two 
administrative offices may 
result in a dramatic increase 
in student influence in 
academic services, housing 
and food administration, and 
other areas. 

A chancellor-appointed 
committee "charged with 
evaluating the present and 
potential Student Affairs 
Office" will decide Friday on 
a proposal to "redefine areas 
of responsibility" for that 
office, student committee 
member Nancy Laga said 
yesterday. 

The proposal most likely to 
be approved for Chancellor 
Atkinson's consideration 

w<?ul~ put academic services, 
(recruitment and retention 
programs), housing and food 
services, the University 
Bookstore and the admis-
sions and registrar's offices 
under the auspicies of the 
vice chancellor of student 
affairs. 

Academic services are 
currently the responsibility 
of Assistant Vice Chancellor 
Harold Temmer in the 
Academic Affairs Office. 
Housing and food services, 
and the bookstore now 
answer to Vice Chancellor 
Herm Johnson in the 
Business and Finance 
Management Office. 

Most students and 
administrators contacted by 
The Daily Guardian yester-
day voiced strong approval of 
this proposed transfer of 
res~nsibilities. 

• You've got different 
perspectives and different 
priorities in different 
offices," said Linda Sabo, 
student committee member 
and Student Body Presi-
dent's Council Chairwoman. 

"The Business Office, 
while concerned about 
students, I'm sure, has a 
more profit-oriented mentali-
ty than the Student Affairs 
Office, which has a more 

student-oriented mentality," 
she said. 

Sabo believes the Student 
Affairs Office "mentality" 
would result in lower prices 
in the bookstore, administra-
tive decisions more in line 
with student's needs and 
more student influences on 
academic and other services. 

And the Student Affairs 
Office, which controls areas 
including health services, 
legal services, athletics and 
student financial services, 
has traditionally been more 
accessible to and accountable 
to student's needs. 

"Placing these new areas 
(academic services, housing 
and food services and 
bookstore) under student 
affairs is a very positive 
change," Laga said. "When 
students have to deal with 
the Business Office, it's like 
going to another planet. The 
crucial student services 
should be accessible and 
under one office." 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage, 
whose resignation in part 
precipitated the creation of 
the reorganization rommit-
tee, also favors most of the 
proposed changes. 

"I've said all along that 
residence and dining halls 
ought to be under student 
affairs," said Armitage, 
adding that "outreach and 
OASIS (recruitment and 
retention programs here) 
should be t~ther and under 
student affaIrs." 

Temmer, who is now 
responsible for academic 
services, was reluctant to 
comment on the proposed 
shift in responsibihties but 
did say, "I personally believe 
the best interest of this 
campus would be served if 
these (academic) services 
remain under academic 
affairs' control."

School garden receives support 
BY AL GOODMAN 

SANTA CRUZ, Ca. - Jim Bierman 
admits he was skeptical at first. 

As a parent and later a board member at the 
Live Oak School District, he doubted that his 
two sons, aged 8 and 10, were going to learn 
much by periodically: leaving their public 
school classrooms for a lesson in the 
schoolyard's experimental garden. 

In two year s time, however, the little 
experiment has grown into a three-acre farm 
backed by a $100,000 U.S. Department of 
Education grant. 

Just outside their classroom doors at the 
Green Acres School, 425 third, fourth, and 
fifth-graders are surrounded by 60 t~ of 
v~tables, fruit trees and flowers, us 20 
chIckens and rabbits. A solar- eated 
greenhouse, oven and food dryer round out 
the farm. 

"My two sons were actually learning some 
science, writing stories about what they were 
doing and learni~ to spell" words they used 
in the garden, Bierman said. 

Dozens of other doubtful parents in this 
largely low-income, blue-collar district have 
also charured their minds, and school officials, 
mindful tnat the federal grant could end by 
June,are now busy cultivating what may be 
the garden's most valuable crop: community 

Administrators (AASA), a nationwide group 
of. educators based in Arlington, Virginia, 
reports that 72 percent of America's families 
do not have children in elementary and 
secondary schools, efther public or private. 
By 1990, the number is expected to rise to 81 
percent. 

"It raises a real challenge of how we 
cOl1lmunicate with communities the 
importance of education in a democratic 
society," said Gary Marx, AASA's associate 
director. 

The national trends have not bypassed the 
Live Oak School District. Indeed, they are 
magnified here by relative poverty. According 
to Principal George Buehring, 60 percent of 
the school's students come from single-parent 
homes and a third receive welfare money. 

"It's a real mix of siIl,!{le parent and lower 
income families who don t have a lot of time" 
for the schools, saidJohn Brissenden, a school 
board member. 

Yet a recent outdoor brunch at the garden 
drew 150 people who donated $1,200 on the 
spot. Many in attendance did not have kids at 
the school and the same is true of ·45 
individuals and businesses that regularly 
contribute time and money, said Roberta 
Jaffe, director of the project, called Life Lab. support for public education. 

It is a tough issue throughout American "You can't J'ust- have support from

At the same time, the traditional pool of "What we're trying to do here is convince

schoolchildren - is rapidly diminishing. they can teach the basics," said Gary Appel,

The administration 

obviously believes that a 
reduction in the noise level is 
far more necessary and 
desirable than the need for 
alternative transportation 
services. Convenient mass 
transit is desperately lacking 
in San Diego, and the 
increase in ridership of the 
NCTD line 301 should be 
viewed as a vote of confidence 
in the mass transit which 
exists. Riding the bus is more 
economical than driving cars, 
does not add to the air 
pollution problem and of 

particular concern to UCSD, 
does not add to the already 
over-crowded parking 
situation. 

By re-routing campus bus 
service, the administration is 
turning its back on such 
arguments for mass transit 
and is in effect encouraging 
us all to abandon the use of 
mass transit in favor of 
driving cars. Rather than 
being rewarded for doing our 
part for conservation and 
their ecology, we are being 
punished for a totally selfish

Feminist and Reagan 
are very much alike 
Editor: 

What do Ms. Germaine 
Greer and Mr_ Ronald Reagan 
have in common? One 
fundamental emotion: it has 
been their unreasoning 
indignation which has 
plunged them into dealing 
with matters about which 
they know nothing, art and 
government respectively, 
and as a result both offer us 
the same excess of clear and 
logical thought. 

The performance of Ms. 
Greer in Mandevi lie 
Auditorium on Nov_ 6 was 
certainly incoherent, and I 
will probably be doing her 
audience a service if I 
summarize some of the ideas 
which I suppose were 
contained within her 
humorous ramblings. 

Ms. Greer first described 
the restrictive, alienating Art 
of the Male, as illustrated by 
some ideas from Kant, which 
she introduced lightly in a 
mocking tone of voice, 
perhaps not aware that their 
clarity provided the most 
valuable insight of the 
evening into her topic-the 
relationship between women 
and art - and completely 
destroyed her own theses. 
She then went on to talk 
about the dangers to the 
happiness and indeed the 
quality of the artistic work of 
women if they shoufd try to 
model themselves after the 
romantic male stereotype of 
the lonely, suffering artist. 

In contrast to Male Art Ms_ 
Greer offered women Female 
Artifice, in which guise art 
would step down from its 
pedestal. The auaience 
listened speUbound as Ms. 
Greer lovingly described her 
vision: no longer would 
rearranging the furniture, 
cooking, gardening (not 
landscape gardening, which 
is a male preserve), knitting 
socks for the baby be just a 
mundane part of daily bfe-it 
would all now be Art! Art fit 
for women. An endless vista 
into suburbia_ 

But Ms_ Greer did not 
express her ideas as c1el1rlv 
as this, Indeed, she offered 
the audience tantalizing 
glimpses of a kind of 
dialectical antithesis when 
she praised the excellence of 
several women painters who, 
instead of sticking to their 
knitting, actually dared to 
enter the domain of Male Art 
and would have succeeded 
there had it not been for their 
self-consciousness in that 
strange land. Or again, it 
became apparent that some 
of the dollars extracted from 
the audience bv Ms. Greer 
would in all probability go to 
feed the very same art market 

that she had so vehemently 
denounced. 

The cliche that feminists 
are motivated by their deep 
hatred of men has tradition· 
ally been a part of male self-
defense. Unfortunately, in 
the case of Ms. Greer this has 
a great deal of truth in it. 
This became clear at the end 
of the lecture, when Ms. 
Greer first very competently 
misunderstood and then 
brutally crushed a question 
which pointed to some of the 
irrational fears inherent in 
her ideas. A hatred of men is 
of course acceptable in a 
feminist, but the fact that 
Ms. Greer still cannot come 
to terms with such as basic 
part of her personality can 
only harm the cause of which 
she IS sHIl one of the chief 
representatives_

Unite for 
orgasms! 
Editor 

I'd like to take this 
privileged opportunity to 
announce to the UCSD 
student body the recent 
formation of the organization 
MENTOO (Male's Especial 
Need to Orgasm OpUlently). 

Due to the close-minded 
dogmatism of monorgas",is", 
and devious female sexual· 
politicking, we men have 
been oppressed too long. We 
of MENTOO feel that we 
have been deprived of a most 
cherished right that every 
human intrinsically possess-
es, that of multiple orgasms. 

Our female counterparts 
have for some time demand-
ed, as sexually self-actualized 
beings, that we men do 
mental gymnastics during 
the heat of the moment in 
order to satisfy them and 
bring them countless 
pleasures. We are now 
turning the times table. Men, 
multiple orgasms are not a 
female monoply nor some 
type of feminine phenomena. 
No, we can have them too! 
Not only can we have them 
but it is our deserved nght. It 
is time to let women know of 
our want and our demand of 
multiple orgasms. Soon, 
women will begin asking us, 
"Well, how many this time, 
honey?" 

So men, come to your 
senses, and keep coming, and 
coming, and coming .... 
Remember, once is ,.01 
enough!

V' ger I ' discloses 
lopsided rings 

PASADENA (AP) , -
Voyager I, extending man's 
~yes over a billion miles of 
space, officially entered the 
exotic realm of Saturn 
yesterday as it pierced the 
boundary of the giant golden 
planet 's magnetic field. 

The ship, already delight-
ing scientists with new 
mysteries about the planet, 
its rings and 15. known 
moons , entered Saturn's 
protective magnetic sheath 
shortly before 5 pm ' PST, 
mission officials said. 

CaIled the bows hock, the 
boundary marks the point 
882,000 miles from Saturn 
where the planet 's magnetic 
field is stron~ enough to 
deflect solar wmd, a stream 
of .particles from the sun_ 

The ship, battered but 
healthy after a voyage of 38 
months and 1.24 billion 
miles, showed Earthbound 
scientists the first, of seven 
new worlds as its route 
skimmed just 2,500 miles 
from mighty Titan, a red-
orange giant that's the 
biggest moon in the solar 
system. 

With cameras clicking and 
instruments humming, 
Voyager will buzz at least five 

other moons and examine the 
deepening puzzle of Saturn's 
glimmering rings today as its 
exploratory tour takes it 
77,000 miles from the 
churning golden clouds that 
are the planet's only surface. 

Cpief scientist Ed Stone 
said before the encounter 
that Voyager's cameras may 
not be able to penetrate 
Titan's dense atmosphere of 
methane, or natural gas, 
covered by a haze of smog_ 
"I haven' t seen anything to 
give me an iota of hope," 
Stone said. 

Foremost among them was 
the discovery of at least two 
confusing nonconformists -
mini-rings that are out of 
round':"" among the hundred 
or more almost perfectly 
circual ringlets now known 
to make up the planet's 
bright, broad rings. New 
pictures also revealed what 
one scientist described as 
possibly "one heck of a hill" 

Even as mission officials 
were making last-minute 
preparations for the series of 
close encounters, they were 
also getting "a bit nostalgic 
that Voyager 1 will not 
encounter any more planets" 
after Saturn, Davis said.

WASHINGTON - The 
House Budget Committee 
ignored Republican protests 
yesterday and passed a 
binding federal budget ceili~ 
that would obligate Presl-
dent·elect Ronald Reagan to 
cut federal spending by 2 
percent. 

The resolution , .which 
would affect all federal 
spending except that for 
defense, was sent to the full 
House for a vote during the 
lame-duck session that 
begins today. Democrats 
answered criticism by saying 
they were just ~ving the 
incoming preSIdent an 
opportunity to fulfill 
campaign pledg~s.

abuse and outright fraud' ,"

The "SWdent l'l'ut" section provides a 
forum for interaction with AS members, 
expression of concerns, proposal of solutions 
and offering of qitidsms. 

Your if1XJt is necessary for three main 
reasons: first, . as scholars and peers you have 
the undeniable right to offer us your 
consultation. Second, from your vantage 
point, your input can be helpful in ASUCSD 
decision making, which may affect }1JU directly 
or indirectly within the university experience. 
Third, participation and offering a voice in 
student goverrvnents may perhaps offer you a 
meaningful learning experience. 

For your convenience the "Srudent Input" 
section is placed at the beginning of the 
agenda. For more information, contact the AS 
office at x4450 or come to the AS meetings in 
the North Con~ence Room at 6:30 pm on 
Wednesday. We look forward to seeing }OU 
there.

AbOut the 
activity fee 

Since 1967 the UCSO campus actMty fee 
has been six cl:>IIars. During the same period,. 
Inflation has risen drastically, significantly 
redudng the quantity and quality of service 
that the Associated Students can provide for 
-Its student population. Few students really 
know where their activity fee money goes. 
Although it does fund the Assodated Students 
government in its effort to fight tuition, aop 
date changes, and for other student concerns, 
activity fee money also funds the following: 
the ne\N Assodated Srudents Internship 
Office which offers student internships in 
Washington DC, Sacramento. and San Diego; 
SCURI. the Student Center for Uldergraduate 
Research and Innovation from which students 
can receive grants for their own research 
projeas; COITVTlittee for World Democracy's 
free political film series; T.G.I.F.s; Cinco de 
Mayo festivities; S.H.I.P., the Student Health 
Information Program; KSDT, UCSO's Very own 
radio station which soon could be heard all 
over campus; the A.S.sorted Vinyl record coop 
at the Student Center; the Food Coop; 
CAP.E., the valuable Courses and Professors 
Evaluation; (Ner 150 student organizations 
and recreational dubs and much, much more. 
Yet all of the above are in serious jeopar<¥ 
unless the present activity fee is inaeased for 
the first ti~ in thirteen years. Therefore, the 
ASUCSD Coundl would like to educate 
sdtudents of the financial tension at hand sa 
srudents will be prepared for the upcoming 
refererldum question irM>Iving an actMty fee 
increase.

Monroe, 'Father of Bluegrass,' 
will play at UCSD tonight 

Has played for over 40 years 
Bluegrass music never 

sounded better than at the 
hands of Bill Monroe, who has 
spent more than 40 years 
shaping and polishing the music 
of his Kentucky homeland. 

Monroe and his Bluegrass 
Boys will appear in concert at 8 
pm tonight in Mandeville 
Auditorium. Tickets cost $6, 
general admission; $5 for 
students and UCSD facuIty and 

• staff and $4 for students. 
Monroe is often referred to as 

the father of bluegrass, the man 
who invented the form. He is 
credited with taking the music 
of the Appalachians and 
blending it with the blues to 
crea te a sou nd that is 
authentically American. 

Bluegrass is a living folklore, 
with stories told in sprightly 
song and dreamy ballad. It is an 
acoustic sound, with tight vocal 
harmonies supported by 
mandolin, guitar, fiddle and 
banjo . Monroe's mandolin 

playing has been called the best 
around. 

The Bill Monroe and his 
Bluegrass Boys concert is being 
sponsored by the University 
Events Office. 

University Events produc-
tions are chosen by a 
com bination of artist 
availability and interest of 
student committees appoint-
ed to represent student tast 
and involvement.

Draniatic history: 'Tobacco Road' 
Poverty story plays with too much on-stage energy 

BY BECKY LOWEN 
AND 

JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 
"What you are seeUlg is a class 

doing a work in progress," director 
Eric Christmas said Sunday night 
before UCSD's current production of 
Tobacco Road. 

What we also saw was a 45-year-
old work dusted off not for its 
theatrical value, but for its depiction 
of the plight of the nation's 
impoverished farmers in the 19308_ 

-"It's in the tradition of Of Mice and 
Men and The Grapes of Wrath," 
Christmas said. 

But the production is never 
properly placed in its historical 
context and so what we get is not a 
moving social commentary, but a 
funny play leaning towards the 
grotesque. 

The play opens with leeter Lester, 
a Georgia sharecropper unable to 
raise crops for seven years, 

squabbli~ with his son Dude over 
the family s chronic lack of food. The 
stupidity and narrow-mindednes of 
these people i revealed early when 

Dude shows his father the flattened 
ball he's been throwing against the 
house and complains, "Look what 
this house did to my ball." Ada, 
leeter's wife, silently accepts their 
starvation poverty, complain ing 
only about the shortage of snuff and 
a bout her lack of proper burial dress_ 

Her disfigured daughter, Ellie 
May, longing for affection, makes 
sexual advances to her brother-in-
law as Dude, her little brother, looks 
on with curiosity and delight_ 

Later, Dude agrees to marry the 
sex-hungry preacher, Bessie, after 
she promises to bur. him a car. ("Will 
it have a horn?" '1 don't know any 
car that don't come with one.") 

Standing out among these 
grotesque subplots is the story of 
Pearl, the family's 12-year-old 
daughter, who runs away from her 
oafish hus band after being sold to 
him for $7. She will talk to noone but 
her mother. and won't leave Tobacco 
Road . 

Pearl isn't the only one who won't 
go. Her father. mother. brother and 

sister also stay for no obvious 
reason_ It is never made clear why 
they are content to slowly starve on 
their farm instead of moving to the 
nearby milltown. 

We also can't understand where 
these starving people find all the 
energy to bicker and fight. The point 
may be to show the tenacity of the 
human spirit, but the characters 
instead come across as petty and 
mean. 

The actors are not to blame for 

their energetic performances - they 
are all good, particularly Tom 
Mitchell as leeter, Elizabeth Ross as 
Ada and Lucinda Holshue as Ellie 
May. 

Finding a way to really hit home 
the effects of poverty and especially 
the hardships encountered by 
Depression-era farmers might have 
been difficult to do without boring 
the audience_ But if the point was to 
present a piece f history, it should 
have been done. 

iTobacco Road' is a grotesque play 
that slips into humor 
sometimes dulling its impact.

"enrollment management 
team" as one area that migh t 
be hurt by the change. 

"We're really progressing 
on our enrollment manage· 
ment team," Temmer said. 
"We contact students in the 
tenth grade and then use our 
Outreach Program in the 
twelfth grade . OASIS 
summer programs then work 
to prepare students for 
enrollment," he said, adding 
that this "team should 
successfully produce growth 
in the under·represented 
populat ions on campus 
soon." 

Temmer fears this "team" 
effort may be hurt or lost 
should he lose control of 
academic services. 

One concern the reorgani· 
zation comittee must address 
before choosing a final 
restructuring proposal is the 
backgrou nd the Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
would need to deal with these 
added areas of responsibility. 

With the resignation of 

Armitage effective next 
August, the search for a new 
head of student affairs will 
soon be underway. The 
qualifications set for that 
position will depend largely 
on the action taken on the 
committee's proposal. 

If academic services, 
housing and food services 
and the bookstore were 
placed under the vice 
chancellor of student affairs, 
that administrator would 
need a broader background, 
with experience in academic 
and administrative or 
business areas. 

Another change the 
committee will discuss 
Friday deals with the 
existing influence campus 
Provosts have on the various 
vice chancellors' offices. 

"The lines of communica· 
tion between academic 
affairs. student affairs and 
the provosts offices could be 
improved," Laga said. "The 
provosts' position could be 
much more effective on 
campus· ...

$461,110 was- allocated for 
transportation alternatives. 
Parking permits (one dollar 
per month per A, B, and S 
permits) supplied $93,205. 
Other sources of revenue 
include funds supplied by 
University Hospital, the VA 
Hospital and the Medical 
school ($45,000), fines and 
forfietures ($95,000), Regents 
Working Capital Loan (given) 
for the purchase of vans only 
- $78,(00), vanpool rider 
payments ($56,025) and 
Hospital Patient and 
Vauclain Point Shuttles 
($93,880). • ... 

Reasons as to why lA-SD is 
so behind in transportation 
alternatives in comparison to 
other universities may stem 
from the fact that Umstead 
set up the Alternative 
Transportation Office onlY 'a 
year and a half ago. Managers 
before him had not addressed 
the problem and he had to 
start with no base. Umstead 
pointed out that students are 
not getting direct benefits at 
this point, but he feels that in 
future years transportation 
alternatives will greatly 
improve.

I urge everyone to voice 
their opposition to the 
Administration's proposal by 
writing to the Parking and 
Transportation Office and 
carbon copying your letter to 
the Chancellor's Office. The 
administration must realize 
that its proposal will not and 
cannot be tolerated by those 
of us affected by its petty, 
myopic complaint. The 
Admmstration should have a 
the good of the UCSD 
community at heart; in this 
case, it obviou!ily dcles not.
