Academic Senate 

The power, 
By JOHN SHAW. Selllor wff Writer 

O NE of the mo t inl1uencial . organizations on campus is litde known [0 
undergraduates even though it 
pervades nearly all aspects of studenc 
life . 

The Academic Senate is a system-
wide faculty govemmenc that is 
empowered by the Board of Regencs 
[0 set admission requiremencs, 
approve all courses taught, [0 
detennine the conditions needea to 
obtain a degree , and [0 assist on the 
search for deans, chancellors and 
presidencs. 

Every faculty member at the 
University is a member of the 
Academic enate . The UCSO division 
has approximately 900 members. 

The University of California, unlike 
many other institutions across the 
nation , is run by a process known as 
" hared governance : in which faculty 
and administration work [Ogether to 
co nduct the university . 

According [0 Dr. James K. Lyon , 
Academic Senate Chairman and new 
Provost of Fifth College. "At most 
institutions. most significant 
decisions ;!~e made by the 
administration ." 

The Academic Senate perfonns 
many functions that would ordinari 
be the responsibility of the 
administration . 

"The University [of California] 
invests a lot of money in running the 
Senate , but it saves a lot of money. 
too ." sa id Lyon. 

Although UC sometimes must pay 
for travel expenses for Senate 
members and hire additional 
instructors to teach classes while 
faculty members are busy with Senate 
work, Lyon said the Academic Senate 
"does an enonnous amount of work 
that the administration would have to 
do. It's a bargain ." 

The result. according to Lyon . i "a 
better run in titution . because the 
faculty has a voice; not an absolute 
voice . but strong enough so the 
adminl tration doesn 't like to huck 

faculty ."

The A ademlc Senate currently has 

23 committees in service. Some meet 
once a quarter. while others meet 
once a week or more . 

The Admissions Committee. which 
mcludes the Registrar and an 
undergraduate representative. makes 
such decisions as [0 what the 
minimum GPA requirement will be , as 
well as community college 
transference policies. 

The Planning and Budget 
Committee establishes the long range 
plans of the university. It addresses 
i sues such as redefining the college 
system, whether or not [0 have a 

ixth College. the future growth of 
graduate schools. and how big the 
ampus should become. At UCSO's 

present growth rate . there will be 
17 .000 undergraduates In attendence 
b the year 2000. 

The rwo harde t working enate 
committees. according to Lyon . are 
the Committee on Educational Policy 
(CEP) and the Committee on 
Academic Personnel (CAP). 

Every course taught at UC 0 (with 
the exception of some graduate 
profe sional chools) must be 
approved by the CEP. It IS this 
committee's duty [0 et educational 
policies and detennine if the general 
education requirements are stringent 
enough . 

The CEP evaluates the quality of 
undergraduate teaching by reviewing 
three departments a year. The CEP 
recently reviewed all of the writing 
programs offered . 

LaSt May. this committee approved 
the'outline of Fifth College's 
curriculum. ext fall . it will approve 
the indiVIdual ourses to be offered. 

The CEP is al 0 the court of lost 
appeals for grades. 

The Committee on Academic 
Personnel is one of the few

UCSD parking lots ea~ prey for burxlars. 

Cars burglarized 
By ERIC CHAZANKIN. Sl<IJ] IVIlCn 

AUTOMOBILE break-ins continue to be a problem at UCSD. as III other pans of Sail Diego, even though the campus' police have caught several thieves. 
"It's a Significant problem," accordi ng to gt. BI(lnan of the U D 

police depanment. "We've captured a number of them," he said, but Â· 
admitted that robberies still take pia e. Wh en a rash of break-ins 
occurs. he added , it's usuaUy due to "a concened effon." At other 
times, he saId , unplanned "crimes of opportunity ," may still take 
place when a tempting target is at hand. 

Branan did say that UCSD may be a safer place to park than 
many other pans of San Diego. The Campus Police Department's 
response time of two to five minutes is "pretty good . compared to 
the ity." he said . 

"Wc have a very good record [in capturi ng thievesl : he added; 
"we builJ case studies . and ... we will stake our an area: where they 
are expected to strike. 

"They come up here in groups." he said. and "go through the 
parki ng lots until they find a stereo they want." The thieves look for 
cars which usually have expe nsive stereos , particularly Blaupunkts, 
Branan said. Although stereos are the most common targets. thieves 
may also steal speakers 0 1 other anicles in a vehicle. 

AldlOugh cars parked along North Torrey Pines Road, "arc more 
likely to be hit ," Branan Said tha t break-illS can and do occur aU over 
campus. He has some suggestions for helping to prevent crimes of 
this sort, beginning with the importance of being alen and 
reporting suspicious people . 

"Once in a while people will caU in, l butl the majority of calls are 
from our own people . If you see someone actinb suspiciously ... 
don't feel we're goi ng to think you're stupid if you caU us: we need 
l people'sl eyes and ears," Branan said . 

To protect your own vehicle , Branan said that parking in a well-lit 
area and locki ng your car are both important, basic steps to take. 
Also, "A quality alal1n can be a good precaution ," he said. Beware of 
cheap alarms, though: ac ording to Branan. a car with an alarm 
whIc h ontinues to sound for a long time may be towed awayl Ia

DJ. rebuked . for 
racial jokes 
By SUSAN WADMAN 

O N the morning of Feb. 26. Rand y Mi ller. a dlSl-Jockey for KS-103 FM 
III an Diego, inVIted listeners to 
call in their Chinese jokes in 
response to a dispute over Larry 
Himmal's charac ter, KC. Wong. 

Channel 8 and the executive-
director o f the Union of Pan 
Asian Communities, the 
preSident of Asian Pacifi c 
American Coalition-USA, and 
Ming Leung, a UCSD graduate, 
met on Feb. 25 to discuss the 
removal of the offensive 
stereotyping of K.c. Wong from 
"San Diego at Large." 

"The San Diego Union covered 
the meeting. The next morning, 
Miller picked up o n their anicle 

and began broadca';(ing racIst 
Ch lllese jokes," Leung said . 

A wave of IIldependent San 
Dlegans immediately called III to 
KS-103 and demanded that 
Miller make a public apology to 
the Chi nese community. 

O n Feb. 27, Miller offered 
what the Los Angeles Times ca lled, 
"a to ngue-in- heck apology." 

"It was a direct backlash on 
the eth nic stereotyping we were 
trying to elim inate in KC. 
Wong," Leung said. 

Miller is planning on handling 
any other requests for apology by 
letter. "Rehashing the subject on 
the radio will JUSt stan something 
new. I f it wasn't a racia I issue 
before, it might develop into 

one," Miller said . 
Ca lls have alreaJy come in 

dcfendtng Miller's se nse of 
humor. 

Leung feels that Miller's 
apology was completel), 
lIlappropnate and IS asklllg for 
a formal public one to both the 
Ch inese and San DIego 
OmmUl1ltles. 'Tv(' received 

numerous copIes of letters being 
se nt to Mille r asklllg for another 
apology," Leung sa id. 

James Pmpin , a UCSD Revelle 
student wrote one o[ the more 
power[ul letters, said Leung. It 
asked [or a repnmand against 
M iller for his extremely unethical 
and inhumane behavior and 
demanded another apology 

Although ChriS Conway, 
preSident and general manager 
o f KS-103 doesn't believe an 
apology is in order because 
Miller picks on many kinds of 
peo ple, Miller has stated that he 
would definately be sending out 
letters of apology. ~ 

Journalist speaks on Philippines 
By JAMES PINPIN 

Reese Erlich , a journalist who 
was in the Philippines during 
the plebiscite [or the new 
constitution , gave a presentation 
March 4 in Peterson Hall about 
the Philippine political situation. 
The presentation consisted of a 
slide show depicting the present 
political and economic 
conditi ons in urban areas (like 
Manila and Tondo and rural 
areas like Pampanga), a talk 
expressing Mr. Erlic h's views of 
the current situation and its 
implicatlons, and an exclusive 

video o[ the Mendiola incident. 
According to Erlich, the 

situation is far from favorable as 
the Aquino administration drifts 
to the Right. is typified by 
the massacR J , demonstrating 
farmers by the military in 
Mendiola and tl- e 
adminis tration's insufficient 
demand for reparation. Though 
there have been positive changes 
such as the freeing of political 
prisoners, unhampered political 
activity and high hopes from the 
people themselves, the 

Philippine government still has 
to deal with th ree major 
problems - land reform . the 
military, and counter insurgency. 

Cory Aquino still has the 
suppon of the Filipino people, 
Erlich explained. This is shown 
by the strong turnout of voters 
for the ratification of the new 
constitution. The turnout showed 
not only support for the present 
administration but the desire of 
the Filipino people for stability.

Every faculty member IS 
reVIewed penodlcally for 
promotion by a peer review 
process. 

"Very few II1stitutlons do that. 
We think it makes a better

The Senate IS hIghly successful 
In appollltlng who the), want. 
According to Lyon, "more than 
98 perce nt of appomtments are 
made as submitted by the Senate 
to the Vice-Chancellor" 

The entire faculty is allowed to 
vote on Sena te issues; however. 
the sheer number of voting 
members requires the Senate to 
distribute mail ballots if 
requested . 

The Senate's enormous power 
is evidenced by the fact that it 
effectively eli minated resigned 
Chancellor William Mcclory by 
issuing a vote of no confidence. 

Everything from Education 
Abroad and library

Because there are so many

on Committees to appOInt faculty 
members to do various 
committee work. 

The Academic Senate has been 
cnticized by some for its poliCies 
on career promotions and ment 
increases. Students, faculty and 
legislators have questioned the 
Senate's pno rities when It comes 
to research and teaching skills. 

According to Lyon, "Research 
IS given the highest priority, but 
not the sole one. IThe 
II1Stru tor's I teaching has to be 
adequa te" 

Lyon argues that "if you're not 
111 the forefront of your field , 
then you may be teaching dated 
or wrong information. Unless 
there's input, the output will not 
be any good. 

"Research is easier to evaluate 
than teaching. It is very difficult 
to measure how effective a 
teacher is. Some [teachers] get 
misplaced. Some shouldn't be

Riley's salary 

Editor: 
Last spring during the 

ASUCSD election campaign there 
was one aem contai ned In my 
platform, The Four POInt Plan .' 
where my position has shifted. 
Thus I feel it IS Import.lnt to 
convey to the students that 
elected me m)' reasons tor my 
change m mind . The Itcm I am 
peaking of IS salaries for A . 

Council members. 

Going into the campaign I 
leaned (Qward a position of not 
paying salanes to AS. Council 
members, II1cludmg the office of 
PreSident. My reasons for this 
were the results of a referendum 
question 111 the spnng of 1983. 
The results II1d icated a 77 .6 
percent maJonty against student 
government officers receiving a 
salary from tudent Activity Fees. 
Because of this result and fact 
that I was not expecting a salary 
upon taking the Job of AS. 
PreSident I felt It was necessary 
(Q decline the salary Therefore , 
111 my annual budget presented 
to the ASUCSD Council I 
donated my salary of 
approximately <;2 .100.00 (Q the 
A . Programmmg budget ThiS I 
the current situation. 

So what made me change my 
mind? Well it was a number of 
things. First of all, those that 
know me realize that I spend at 
least 25-30 hours per week doing 
work for the Associated Students. 
This along with a normal 
acad'emic load, does not allow 
tlme for a serious part-time job 
(i.e., 15 hours/ week). Secondly, 
salaries serve as a great way (Q 
Insure solid perfonnance , as 
every paid member is reviewed 
twice monthly by the AS. Judi lal 
Board : No Work, No Pay 
Thirdly, the level of payment 
reflects approximately 33-40 
percent of the :lctual amount of 
time put 111. For example , the 
AS. President gets paid 
6.79/ hour at 10 hours per week 
at 30 weeks per year This tends 

to put the salary more 111[0 the 
perspective of a minimal stipend . 
Lastl)', the method m which 
salaries arc given out docs not 
VIOlate the four year old 
referendum question . The 
salanes come from the Interest 
gamed off of the Mandated 
Re erves account, thus they do 
not come directly from the 
tudcnt ActiVity Fcc. 

This hange of mll1d places 
me 111 a very awkward situation. 
hould I now take my salary? In 

my opinion that IS not the hest 
thing to do. I made a promise 
during last spring's campargn [Q 
donate my salary to the AS. 
Programming and I intend [Q 
keep that promise and every 
other contained in The Four 
Point Plan: 

Salaries for student 
government officers are only fair 
and they can do nothmg but 
enhance the performance of 
student government officers. 

- John P. Riley 
President, Associated Students 

Sliced bread 
Editor. 

Re' the "slamming" I 
supposedly recetved at the hands 
of Robert Victor BeUerue in the 
Feb 26 issue of the Guardwn 

It IS true that I have not been 
[Q Nicaragua. but then neither 
has the vast maJonty of the 
students at UC 0 who must use 
evidence other than first-hand 
observatIon of the sltuatlon in 
order (Q deCide what's truly 
happemng m licaragua. 
However, sll1ce Mr. BeUerue 
places such a high emphaSIS on 
1[' let me recount some of the 
observations of people who have 
been there . 

Russell Means. leader of the 
American Indian movement. and 
the man that led the 1973 
takeover of the tOwn of 
Wounded Knee, IS hardly a 
right-wing conservative or 
supporter of the Reagan 

Admlmstra tion. He has been [Q 
Nicaragua within the past year. 
In the August- eptember 1986 
Issue of Reason magazme . he 
talked about what he found . 
Some of hIS statements were : 

"The Ind ian resIstance (tn 
Icaragua) ha~ been gomg on 

fhere for five years - longer 
than an>' of Ihe Contra<; have 
been tn eXlsten e ... The 
Miskito-Sumo-Rama Indian of 

Icaragua ,1TC 2 .. self suITiclent 
people. Hlstoncally they have 
dnven ofT the panl h. and they 
drove the Engltsh from their 
lands. Even Somoza left them 
alone ." Means says the 
Sandinistas felt they couldn't 
truSt the Indians and destroyed 
58 villages along the Rio Coco 
River, whic h runs along the 
northern border. This began the 
aImed struggle by the Indians. 
Document ing atroci ties duri ng 
Interviews with 28 village leaders 
and councils of elders. Means 
found that" ot one Village 
eseaped the atrocities in the 
systema tized genOCide from the 
Sandimstas. What the 
andinrstas did in Virtually every 

IndIan Village was to " fo~ce the 
adults into the chur h. And the), 
turned that church tnto a lorture 
chamber .. They raped the 
women in front of the men ... 
and then they went and took the 
boys. 12 to 16 years of age, to 
the local school house, where 
they burned them alive and 
machine-gunned them ." Of the 
claim that the CIA is 
manipulating the Inaians. Means 
says. "Tha t in Itself is racism. 
They're sayi ng that Indian people 
have no mind of thei r onw, and 
we can be manipula ted by the 
nght and the lef!. At th eir whim! 
That we have no brainsl" 
According to Means. both the 
U.S. and Sandinista governments 
arc denigrating the Indian 
resistance in Nicaragua and both 
countries have failed foreign 
poliCies that arc a renection of 
their failure to treat their Indian 
peoples with Justice and fairness. 
He sums the icaraguan 
sttuation up: "The Sandi nistas 

are tryrng to compress 200 years 
of u.s. policy into a decade of 
Nicaraguan." 

Anot her person more d ire dy

Prcilsa . In 1979 she was a

Whom we listen to bills and furnishes him With a car. 
I found that Taffy had some 

fasc rnating things to say. and 
hoped Mel Gibson (the star of 
"Letha l Weapon") would be as 
interesting. I was sad when we 
reached my destination and we 
had to end our conversauon. We 
shook hands and wished each 
other luck; I then entered the

to be held .

class. these students will jot 
down every word if they th ink it

they disregard thei r outspoken 
classmates' comments and 
questions. 

It seems ironic that people go 
to such great lengths to hear a 
certain person "speak" when we 
live in a world with over four 
billion people. 

This notion really hit home 
during a conversation I had 
while being driven from the 
Burbank Airport to the studio 
where I wa s to cove r the 
<;creening of "Lethal Weapon." 
Taffy, a drive r the studio se nt to 
pIck me up from the ai rport , was 
a fri endly black gen tleman. To 
my surprise. he ushered me into 
the back seat of a "p eudo- hmo" 
in which I was to travel in style . 

We discussed the variety of 

"stars" he had drive n along th e 
same route upon which we were 
now driving. 

He subsequently told me about 
the insecure people in 
Hollywood , "who try to look cool, 
while the whole time they' re 
sweating underneath ." 

We then turned to more 
personal matters. I discovered 
that Ta fTy is in the process of

Everybody's talking about stress. Managing stress, dealing with stress, 
analyzing stress with much ado about symptoms, heart attacks, anxiety, 
tension. Thirty million Americans are taking some sort of tranquilizer. 
One out of 10 is drinking themselves into oblivion. People are 
disillusioned, apathetic, unable to get themselves in gear. They're 
distrusting and panicked about the future . They want to be left alone, 
but can't stand alienation. They feel they're disappearing. 
What's Really Going On? 
Evanne Flora, author of this miraculous book got curious about these 
things and did something about it. As one of the U.S.'s top attitudinal 
researchers, she went on a 5-year trek to find answers. She found more 
than we could ever believe. She found that fears were the bottom line 
issues behind these problems. Not fear of the dark, or the boogeyman, 
but some real primordial fears . Fear of life itself has been called the 
true favorite disease of the 20th Century. And stress, tension, anxiety 
are all just symptoms of this fear and a host of others. And don't think 
the other guy doesn't have these fears .. . he does! And this means top 
execs, professionals, as well as blue collar workers. This sense of fear 

roduces apathy, hopelessness and alienation; dreams not realized, and 
uncertainties about the true reasons and what all of this suggests for 
what appears to be a shaky future. 
In a lucid volume of new ideas and insights, Evanne Flora finds a path 
through this epidemic of fear. A path as a conscious choice to not 

Â· uccu~b. A strength building stream of thought that pulls the pants 
{t...>wn on stress, and resolves to regain our dignity , and our integrity. 
l(s a book for anyone who cares about themselves and their freedoms.

'~ry pag . You have a voice after all. And more than you th ink! If it 
noesn't COllnect with you, we'll gladly refund the price of purchase,

"freedom of the press is a basi 
criterion for detennining if there 
IS democracy in a country. My 
husband used to say. ' Without 
h:edom of the press there is no 
liberty." 

The merits of the Contras are 
certainly subject to debate . It is 
equally true that plenty of 
repression exists in right-wing 
dictatorships, not only in Central 
America. but throughout the 
world. However. blindly inSisting 
that the Sandinistas are the best 
thing since sliced bread. 
especially when so many 
members of the revolt against 
Somoza say the Sandinistas have 
betrayed the revolution. is simply 
foolish . 

Mr. Bellerue says that "it is sad 
to think that Reagan's 
disinfonnation has infiltrated 
and affected the youth of our 
country." What is truly sad. and 
a terrible shame, is that so many 
people cannot intelligently 
debate policy issues without 
resorting to insults and the use 
of epithets such as "ignorant 
bUllhead."

Asian opportunities 
discussed at meeting 
By JAMES PINPIN 

W HAT it means for an Asian/Pacific Islander [0 live in America and 
the types of opponunities that 
are available in America, were 
the main topics of discussion at 
the 9th Annual Statewide 
Asian/Pacific Islander Studem 
Union (APSU) conference last 
Feb. 28 at Third College. 

The conference, the first to be 
held in San Diego, was attended 
by 530 srudenrs representing 
over 40 organizations from an 
over the West Coast region. 
Panicipants, coming from as far 
as the University of Michigan 
and Brown Uni~rsity, were 
present. 

Keynote speaker, Samoa Koria , 
a Samoan islander and a student 
-activist, along with other 
speakers, set the tone of the 
conference by discussing issues 

concerning Asian educational 
rights. immigration , identity. 
political empowennent. the 
building of student organizations, 
and the Phillipine political 
situation. 

One of the issues discussed 
was the model minority image of 
Asian students. This stereotype, 
which is considered by some 
people as being positive for the 
Asian community, was 
unanimously agreed upon as 
actually being negative and 
detrimental. The panel 
discussing this issue also pointed 
out that this minority image has 
not only created extrol academic 
pressure for Asian students, but 
has also incited animosity 
against them. 

They also said that this image 
is being used to pacify the Asian 
community and to make them

however, consists of jobs in 
middle management and average 
salaries amounting to only 40 to 
60 percent of those received by 
caucasians in similar positions. 

Another issue that was 
discussed is the lack of a 
political voice by Asians. This 
discussion was highlighted by a 
speech by Lily Chen. the first 
Chinese-American female mayor. 
as she explained the problems 
and the challenges for Asians in 
the political arena, One of the 
problems that was addressed is 
the lack of political panicipation 
by the Asian community. 
Speakers estimated that the 
Asian popUlation is more than 
enough to create a strong 
political force; however. people 
are jUst not turning out to vote. 
There were even some examples 
cited of how the oppoSite 
political pany was able to recruit 
the VOle of uninfonned Asians. 

The crisis concerning the 
placing of a quota on the 
admission of Asian students in 
higher educational institutions 
was then conferred upon . It was 
thought that the crisis is not only 
very real , but very immense as

well . Many 01 the gains In the 
19605 and 1970s for educanonal 
equity may be revamped by the 
policies of President Reagan and 
Gov. Deukmejian. The facts show 
that up to 80 percent of minority 
youth fail to graduate high 
school. yet the government has 
now vetoed the bilingual bill , 
which affects thousands of 
Asians and Latinos. The capitol 
has also initiated large budget 
cuts in education and categorical 
programs. 

As a culmination of the 
conference's educational rights 
resolution . it was agreed upon to 
join in the "March on 
Sacramento for Educa tion" on 
April 6. The march. which will 
include the panicipation of Rev. 
Jesse Jackson and Sen. Art 
Torres. is expected to begin in 
Southside Park at 9:30 am. near 
the comer of 8th and S streets. 
The rally will end at the State 
Capitol around noon . The rally's 
demands will include more 
funding for education . reinstating 
of fund s for bilingual education. 
equal access - recruitment and 
retemion at the four year 
colleges. and an ethnic-studies 
course as a graduation 
requirement. ~

Continued from paae J

important of the three areas, 
howeve r, is research . The CAP 
reviews the instructor's research 
papers and books. 

Just as the Senate has the 
power to commend a faculty 
member through promotions, it 
too has the power to reprimand 
through diSCiplinary action. 

In one such instance, the 
Senate Comminee instigated a 
largeÂ·scale investigation of a 
UCSD Medical School professor 
charged with falsifying research 
papers and experiments. The 
professor subsequently left the 
university. 

As chair of the Senate. lyon

thc Installment of Hitler as

Ideology whl h pervaded schools 
as well as the whole country: 
-The Nordic Germanic race was

"I had a girlfriend anyway." Heck

he Instead was granted the

Freedman: a rare find at UCSD 
By DA VlD FORMAN 

PROFESSOR DaVld oel Freedman's appointment to the JudaiC Studies 
department at UCSD means a 
heightened respect from Similar 
programs across [he country. 

Experts in the field of 
archcology gave a eries of 
lectures to honor Freedman's 
appointment to the Endowed 
Chair of Hebrew Biblical Studies 
at UCSD. 

"The challenge of being 111 on 
the development of a new 
program on the west coast. With 
the pOSSibility of attracting 
professors and a group of bnght. 
hard-working studems has 
Impelled me to comc here and 
try my hand one last time at 
building a successful program ." 
Freedman said . 

Freedman. who spem the 
winter and spri ng quarters of 
1985 and 1986 at UCSD as a 
visiting professor before 

accepting the chair thiS winter. 
brings with him to UCSD an 
astonishing career of biblical 
scholarship which has spanned 
over forty years. 

Prof. Wilham Propp. 
coordinator of the department , 
sa id that Freedman will act as a 
magnet. attracnng promll1ent 
profcssors to UCSD who wam to 
work with him as well as eager 
students wh 0 will want to study 
under him. Propp referred to 
Freedman as a "nerve cemer of 
Biblical study In Amen ca." 

Freedman JOinS the UCSD 
Judai Studies department at a 
time when It has already gained 
a reputation for excellence in a 
relatively short period of time. 
He said that it is an honor to be 
assoc iated with the professors of 
UCSD. whom he conSiders "first-
rate scholars of established 
reputations. " 

The JudaiC Studies program 

began in 1972 with physics Prof. 
Walter Cohen guiding several 
undergraduates imerested in 
starting a program. After Cohen 
moved to UCSB. Bio-c hemist 
Morris Friedkln took over. and 
was succeeded by Chemist 
Murray Goodman. The program 
then fell into the capable hands 
of Prof. Richard Friedman (who 
now Jokingly refers to himself as 
"the other Freedman"). a Harvard 
professor. Friedman shaped the 
program into what it is today. 
Many courses are still taught by 
Visiting professors. but with the 
help of Friedman, Propp (still 
technically a visiting professor). 
and now David Noel Freedman . 
a credible permanent staff has 
been assembled. 

Much of the success of the 
program is also due to the 
tremendous local support. The 
communities of La Jolla and San 
Diego have been active through a 
visi tors' organization . which has 
helped to raise the endowment 
for JudaiC Studies to nearly $1 
million . Students have also made 
a difference. In the past year. 
over 1.000 students have 
enrolled In programs connected 
m some way to JudaiC Stud lcs. 
The numbers arc mcreasing. and 
a Master., program is under 
conSidera tion Over the next few 
years. the goal of the program IS 
expansion 10 accommodate the 
demand . 

Freedman graduated from 
UCU\ and cominued hi s 
education at Pnnceton 
Theological Sem 111 a ry . where he 
recel veJ a degree' 111 Old 
Te wment tudle~ in 1944. He

Heck was captured by American 
soldiers who employed him as a 
translator. using his bilingual 
ability as they drove through his 
hometown seeking out Germans. 

When the Americans cleared 
out, they did not shoot the 
young Heck as he expected . A 

Lieutenant Smith wrote Heck an 
order and instructed him to 
report to the next American 
soldier he saw. Heck returned to 
Wittlich and followed the order 
without questioning it , as he had 
been conditioned to doing. "I

the a pects of the Bible , with an 
additional 24 or 2S books still to 
come before the series is 
completed . . 

In addition, Freedman is 
helping to edit several Anchor 
Bible supplements. Freedman 
said that "this will include 
auxiliary volumes dealing with 
major themes of Biblical studies, 
such as a history of Israel , an 
introduction to the Hebrew Bible 
and similar volumes. Ultimately, 
there should be as many volumes

Bible itself. but we are only at the 
beginning." Thus far , over SOO 
authors have agreed to get this 
project out of the planning

stages. rreedman hopes to get 
the faculty at UCSD mvolved. 

Despite his enormous 
accomplishments in the pa t, 
Freedman's career is far from 
being over. He is considering 
writing new treatments on two of 
his earliest Biblical studies, 
orthography, the history of 
spelling in ancient times and the 
history of Biblical poetry. He is 
considered to be among the 
world's greatest authorities on 
these subjcts. 

"Once again, there are 
numerous articles -on I these] 
subjects that I have written alone 
or in collaboration . More are on 
the way, but I have felr for some 
time that a synthesis of what we 

know, what we don 't know, and 
how we can fill the gap should 
be prepared." Freedman 
commented . 

Freedman will return to the 
University of Michigan in 1988, 
where he will give the 
DistingUished College Lecture 
series, most likely on the subject 
of 8th century Prophets. He also 
plans to retum to the Princeton 
Theological Scminary 10 give the 
Stone Lectures in 1989, He 
hopes for a book t6 emerge from 
this series of lectures. 

Freedman truly does add 
prestige to an already well-
respected Judaic Studies 
depanment at UCSD, Ii:3

Nowak no hits So. Cal College 
By CHARLES TABESH, Contributing Sports Editor 

UNTIL last week. the limiled success of the UCSD baseball ream 
could be (ied 10 (WO sources: 
hitting and sophomore stalter 
Rick Nowak. Of the six wins that 
the learn had accumulated, 
Nowak recorded (he viclOry in 
nve of them. 

But last week, the TrilOns won 
three more games, raising their 
record 10 9-6, and Nowak got the 
decision in just one of them. So, 
as if 10 protest his obviously 
diminished role , he notched the 
WIn with a no-hitter. 

It came on Saturday at 
Southern California College. He 
struck out three batters and 
walked twO, and is now 6-0 m 
the season. 

The game was the first of a 
doubleheader, which is seven 
innings long in college baseball, 
and Nowak didn't even know 
what was happening until after 
the fifth . "I sat down in the 
dugout. I staned going over each 
inning and J realized, "Shit, I've 
gOt a no-hitter going: he said. 

masterpiece. The Tritons won 
the game 2-0. 

UCSD won the second game 
with the identical score, as 
freshman Kyle Abbon brought 
the shutout imo the eighth 
inning, allowing four hits. He got 
in some trouble, however. so 
freshman Mike Morgan was put 

in to receive his first career save. 
The week's first game was on 

Thursday at Whittier College, 
and was never a come st. UCSD 
got three runs in the first inning, 
two in the second and six in 
third . The TrilOn went on 10 win 
14-1, with Bob Natal getting his 
fifth homerun on a grand 
slam. IZil 

Catcher Bob Natal slugged a grand slam for fifth home run of the season. 

He was a bit nervous in the 
Sixth , walking the second batter 
on four pitches, but he calmed 
himself down and finished the Rick Nowak shows the form which has earned him two no-hitters. 

By AL MCGUIRE 
One thing J have never 

underslOod about college 
athletics is the public perception 
that football is a major domo, the 
Federal Reserve that suppons all 
other activities in the extra-
curricular area. 

What you'll fmd , If you check 
the dollar signs closely, IS that 
guys In the grunt sport don't 
even carry their 0 ""11 weight 
finanCially when it comes to (he 
most lmponant aSSOCiation In 
college sports today - the 
NCAA 

Don't believe It? 
Then let's take a mmutc to 
~ance over the report put 
together by Vic Bubas, the formcr 
Duke coach who IS now 
-ommis5lOner of the Sun Belt 
Conference, on distribution of 
pos t-season football and 
baske tbaU revenues to the NCAA 
and its member schools. 

The results, I guarantee , WIll 
surprise rou. Bubas, who took 
three teams to the Final Four 
Junng hiS ten seasons with the 
Blue Devils has done hi!> 
homework In thl!> one, crossed 
L"vcry "1" and dottcd evel) T 
where the post-season dollars are 
concerned.

~cLk l<) hcs thelt deal with 
pigskin ,; ,ut there, why don 't you 
guys PICi, up a tab C\'ery now 
Jnd then? 

Here are the facts 
[n 1985, the CM Divl~lon I 

men's basketbaU tournament rang 
up the cash registers to the tune 
of $31 ,078,490 in net receipts. 
Of that, $18,647,104 was diVided 
be tween 249 schools and 
$12,431,386 - or roughly 40 
percent - went to the NCAA 
coffers. 

eM-sanctioned footbaU 
bowls. on the other hand lOok 
In 'j;39,038,926 All of whlLh was

wa nut ' lng, nada the middle of 
lhl dOll '" 

Talk about guys thrOwing 
around nickels like they were 
sewer covers. The truth is that 
football 's only contribution to (he 
NeM budget comes from the cut 
the NCAA gets from games 
televised during the regular 
season. This adds up 10 $1.2 
million , or about four percent of 
the NCAA's annual budget. 

That's right. Four percent. 
Hoop coaches, on the other 
hand , have good reason to smile; 
college basketball pays 73 
percent of the cost of Shawnee 
Mission . 

The problem IS , when the 
check comes, the football guys 
are either in the washroom or 
playing the jukebox. [t'S time, [ 
think, to nail the sleeve of their 
Jersey to the table, so they have 
to stick around and help pay the 
bill when the waiter leaves the 
plate . 

r know you'll think I'm talking 
off the wall here, but believe me , 
thiS argument is right on target 
- and long overdue. This is a 
country of one man, one vote , 
and no free lunches. Not even in 
the weight room.
