Pope John· Paul Dies 
ROME (AP) - Pope John 

Paull died of a heart attack in 
his sleep during the night, the 
Vatican announced. He was 65 
and had been elected just last 
month. 

The Vatican said the pontiff 
died about 11 pm Thursday and 
his death was discovered wben 
his bousehold staff came to 
wake him about 5: 30 am Friday 
morning. 

During biB brief reip, the 
pontiff bad already traDl-
formed the DOrmally ledate 
papal audiences into informal 

. gatberingl, peppered wltb 
personal anecdotes and brolreD 
up with laughter from IU .... 

Just two days ago, presiding 
over the weekly Vatican gener-
al audience, be called up a 5th 
grade Itudent and interviewed 
him in front of the 10,000 
persons packing the hall. 

"Do you always want to be in 
the 5th erade?" be asked the 
boy. 

"Yes," the youth replied. "So 
I don't bave to cbange teach-
ers." . 

"Well, you are different from 
the pope," the pontiff re-
marked. "When I wu In 4th 

erade, I worried about making 
it to the 5th and wben in the 5th, 
about pauinl to the 6th." 

Born Albino Luciani, the 
263rd pontiff was the product of 
one of the thouaands of villages 
that dot the Italian countryside. 

"I am a little man accus-
tomed to little things and to 
silence," he said before his 
election. 

He had spent most of his life 
in Italy's northeast where he 
was bom in the Alpine valley 
village of Forno di Canale. His 
father, a socialist, was for 
many years a migrant worker 
in Switzerland. His mother was 
a peasant, "strong and de-
vout," as he once said. 

He was ordained a priest on 
July 7, 1935 and graduated from 
Rome's Gregorian University. 
After graduation be went back 
to his native village to work in 
the local parish, then to a 
nearby town where he also 
taqllt religion in a vocational 
scbool. 

For the next 10 years he was 
deputy director in the Belluno 
Seminary. In IMI, Luciani 
became one of the top aides of 
the biahop of BeUuno and wu

put in charge of teaching 
religion. 

He concentrated on making 
his teaching as simple as 
possible so that illiterate 
mountain people could under-
stand it. He recounted his 
experiences in a book titled 
"Catechism in Crumbs," now 
in its seventh edition. 

He had been vicar general in 
Belluno for four years, when 

Pope John XXII named him 
bishop of Vittorio Veneto, a 
diocese south of Belluno, in 
1958. 

During the 1962-M Vatican 
Council, Luciani said it was 
difficult for him to change his 
frame of mind from pre-council 
church attitudes toward the 
more liberal teachings. 

"The part that caused me 
more problems was that on 

religious liberty," he said later, 
referring to the council decree 
stating the right of full and 
equal liberty for believers and 
non-belivers alike. 

" For years I had been 
teaching ... theories about law 
according to which only the 
true Roman Catholic religion 
has rights. I convinced myself 
we were wrong." 

Campus. Media Funding 
Could Be Cut Soon 

By Jeff Beraford-Howe 
Auodaie Newt EdI&er 

The AS Council beard for the 
first time Wednesday night a 
proposal that could cut off 
funding for all AS subsidized 
campus new.papen and KSDT 
in three years. 

The proposal, submitted as a 
charter for the Media Board by 
Com.municatiOlll ColllJlUaajon-
er Bill FrIecfinan, would allo 
place a ceillng on all 1910-81 
media allocations at no higher 
than any previous year's 
allocation. 

The Media Board's rroposed 
charter, a revision 0 the old 
Communications Board, would 
label all currently publishing 
papers as "new media" for the 
next two lears, after which 
they woul become" existing 
media." Tbe charter would 
allow no funding of existing 
media for more than one year, 
unleSl a student referendum, 
held concurrently. with a 
regular AS election, supported 
that media's continued AS 
subsidy. 

Friedman told the Council 
that the charter was designed 
to stop "re-funding of campus 
media without appropriate 
consideration." Every year, 
Friedman claims, media are 
granted funds from the AS 
without consideration of wheth-

er they are performing a 
service to the campus. 

Friedman says that the 
ceiling on spending limits was 
imposed because "I think that 
there is more than enough 
money for media already." 
Last year's AS Council appro-
priated $25,000 to Friedman for 
subsidies of media and main-
tenance of the AS Media 
Center. 
Jon Bekken, a member of the 
new ladlcator collective , 
condemns Friedman's pro-
posal as "media-cide," and 
says that "it is an attempt to 
eliminate all media but The 
Guardian and the (AS) Bul-
letla." (The Guardiu does not 
receive AS funds, and the 
Bulletia ·is the AS's house 
publication. Carlos Montalvo, 
AS commissioner of public 
relations, told The Guardian 
that Friedman 's proposal 
includes the AS Bulletin .) 

Betken said of the new 
indlca&or's financial situation, 
"There is no way we'll become 
self-supporting in two years ... 
trying to convert in two years is 
ridiculous." Betken also 
complained that freezing 
media budgets after two years 
doesn't allow for inflation, and 
that the proposed charter " flies 
in the face" of testimony last 
Spring taken by Friedman 

concerning AS subsidies of 
campus media . 

Friedman told the Council 
that he will not allocate any 
media funds this year until 
after the Media Board is 
constituted. Consequently, the 
AS Rules Committee will hold 
bearings next Monday night at 
7: 00 pm in an as yet undeter-
mined location to consider the 
charter. The Council is aiming 
at considering the proposal 
itself at its meeting next 
Wednesday night. 

In other action Wednesday: 
- Melanie Alschueler, pro-

gramming commissioner, told 
the Council to " disregard" 
comments made by Student 
Center Board member Gary 
Moser regarding a poSlible 
opening date for Building C 
entertainment and alcohol 
availability. Aischueler said 
that bids for the restaurant will 
be opened to all that can meet 
Student Center Board specifi-
cations, which she said include 
greater menu variety and 
lower prices. Student Center 
Board Director Rich Lapping 
did confirm before the Council, 
though, that what Moser told 
Tbe Guardlaa Monday was 
approximately what his Board 
had been discussing.

Student Irate 
Over Insurance 

Editor: 
I am writiol in respoue to the beadline printed above Ben

or both, above all, don't get sick here. 

Last May •• I had to be driven to the campus health center after 
boun. because of severe intestinal pain. The nigbt nune 
examined me briefly. and decided that I should go to Scripps 
Hospital for treatment. Before lettinl me go, however. sbe gave 
me some inaurance forma. and told me to make sure I siped 
everythlna. so that the insurance would make payments on aU 
charges I incurred. 

Fri •• ..., .. 21. 1178 

Commentary 
I did everything as directed. was treated at the hospital. and sent 

home. I thought tbat was the end of it. but DOW I know that there 
would be no easy finish in the months ahead. Sev~ral weeu after 
my visit to the hospital. I received two billa, totalling $84 for 
emerJency room. doctor. and hospital services. I called to the 
campus insurance office. in . the healthcenter, and was assured 
that the insurance company would take care of it. 

Imagine my surprise. about a week later, walking past the 
health center towards the central library. when a doctor from the 
health center who knew me walked out towards me. and called me 
over to ask whether the insurance had paid my bill yet.I answered 
no. She grimaced. and told me that the school was going to have to 
change their Insurance company. because the current one hadn't 
been paying student claims. and apparently couldn·t. because 
they were going bankrupt. or something like that. I kept that in 
mind. but decided not to worry about it. 

Begin Conceded Everything 
Sadat Wanted At Summit 

Two weeks after that. I received sharply worded bills from bdth 
the hospital and the doctor. Wasting no time. I brought the 
statements into the campus health center. The insurance 
secretary took my bills. asked me a few questions, and infonned 
me the claim had been sent. and that it would be paid within six to 
eight weeks. I called the hospital and doctor to relay them this 
npws 

, 1uch later. by the middle of August. I had received from each 
the hospital and the doctor two bills apiece. I took them to the 
health office as well. The secretary said thank you. I pressed my 
questions about payment. but she gave me a brush-off. September 
arrived. and so did a notice fonn the hospital. It stated that I would 
not receive any more bills . implying I didn' t know what. I 
promptly call~ the hospital. and after explaining the situation. 
was told to walt for one more notice. and that if the insurance had 
not paid them by then. that I should make payment myself as the 
bill would then automatica lly be turned over to a coliection 
agency. 

I quickly called the health office. and asked what was 
har~ning. I was told my claim had been sent to Los Angeles. but 
o n Jy D~ the 19th of July. Still. the woman said~ six to eiBht weeks 
are past. and you can expect payment any day. unless there was 
bad news from the insurance company. She would not say why the 
company might have bad news. because my claim was in order. 
even according to her. Still, she said, if three or foul' more weeks 
past without payment. she could send a tracer, but even a tracer 
would require a six to eight week wait for a reply. 

Besides, she said. the school, being in the middle of negotiating a 
new policy with another company, might have something to do 
with the delay. And to top that off. she told me that since all 
insurance companies are the same anyway. I might as well pay 
the bill myself. 

I pointed out that if I paid the hospital. and the iDBurance 
company subsequently paid the same bill. the hospital might not

Contrary to claims made in 
Cockburn's and Ridgeway's

proclaimed the entire West 
Bank and the Sinai as part of 
Greater Israel. After the 
November visit. Begin decided 
that in the interests of peace. he 
would return the entire Sinai to 
Egypt except for the Settle-
ments there. The purpose of 
these settlements was to act as 
a buffer zone between ElYpt 
and the Gaza Strip. Before 1967 
the Gaza Strip was the major 
breeding ground for PLO 
terrorists who were supplied by 
Egypt. 

In signing the Camp David 
agreements. Begin has made 
the decision to return all of 
Sinai to Egypt. including the 
buffer zone just mentioned. 
once again making Israel 
proper vulnerable to terrorist 
attack. By making this con-
cession. Begin also opened 
himself up to lTeat criticism 
from both bia own party and 
many Israelis who disagree 
with this decision. The He,rut 
Party haa been badly split. 
anll'Y settleJ'l rioted iD the 
streets. and Begin lost a lot of 
poUtical popularity in makina 
the decision he did. Be,in made 
a major sacrifice in returning 
Sinai to Sadat. the sacrifice of 
security. 

Cockburn and RidCeway also 
claim that Israel needs the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank 
because " One-third of Israel's 
water comes from the West 
Bank. and GalS is basically a 
work camp for Israel". Israel's 
main water supply comes from 
the Jordan River which em~ 
ties into the Sea of Galilee 
which is nortb of the West Bank. 

Prior to the 1t17 War. the 
Gaza Strip was a desolate 
wasteland of disease and 
malnutrition. E"gypt refused 
to help the inhabitants of the 
Gaza Strip and would not 
permit assimilation. Wben 
I.rael took over after Itr1 the 

Gaza Strip Arabs were allowed 
free passage through Israel to 
the West Bank and Jordan and 
the average income rose to a 
level equal to or surpassing that 
of Palestinians living in other 
Arab lands. 

In regard to the West Bank. 
some very important infor-
mation was not included in 
Cockburn's and Ridgeway's 
article. They maintain that 22 
mayors of the West Bank 
support the PLO. They ne-
glected to mention the fact that 
the PLO has publicly stated 
that it would assassinate any 
opposition. Sure Begin refused 
to recognize the PLO because 
not only does the PLO not 
recognize Israel but intends to 
annihilate her. And if Cockburn 
or Ridgeway would take a few 
moments to examine.tbe PLO's 
Charter. they would find that 
the PLO would not stop at just 
the destruction of Israel. 
because. according to the 
charter. all of Palestine (whicb 
includes both Israel and Jor-
dan) belongs to the "Pales-
tinians" . 

If Israel were to allow such 
terrorilts as the PLO tQ rule the 
West Bank. she would be 
lnvitina destruction . .. bose not 
familiar with Middle Eastern 
geography may be in~rested to 
know that Tel Aviv. Israel's 
largest population center. 
would be only , miles away 
from their most hated enemy. 
Remembering a recent PLO 
attack outside of Tel Aviv. 
where more tban 35 men. 
women and children were 
killed by terrorists. the mere 
idea of a PLO state, miles from 
the heart of Israel's population 
is a frightening thought 

Israel cannot aUow the PLO 
to control the West Bank for the 
same reason that President 
Kennedy could not allow the

Seeking Answers In Freshman Year 
By Dail S&, Claire BaeoD 

My experience aa a once 
hard-noaed. dedicated rre-med 
student baa taugb me a 
valuable lesson. Wlien I came 
to college I came pre~red to 
work hard and malte A s. I was 
fortbright enougb 'to seek out 
professon durina their office 
bours and ask queationa con-
cerning lecture material. I 
made extenaive use of my T A ·s. 

SeekinJr anawers was prob-
ably the beat thing I did in my 
freshman year. The worst thing 
I did was to concentr.ate only on 
my intellectual growth and 
ignore the rest. I wouldn't even 
sign up for a P.E. class because 
I felt that it would infringe on 
my valuable study time. 

What I failed to realize was 
that exercise makes your 
study time more productive. It 
relieves the mind and body of 
stress. I never realized that the 
mind only functions at its 
" high" peak for a limited time. 

Wben your concentration slips 
and you find ~ounelf staring at 
a page or reailing words ana not 
absorbina then U's time to do 
something else, even if it's for a 
balf hour. 

But I never took that half 
hour. 

I forced myself to concen-
trate and only frustrated 
myself wheD I didn't absorb the 
material I felt I should. 

Although I had decided to be a 
pre-med student before en-
tering college. I did not realize 
that there wasn't any reason to 

cl~ my mind to other disci-
plines. Art and literature carry 
as much importance as chem-
istry and biology. It is just as 
important to learn the way a 
man thinks and feels as it is to 
learn his body's composition. 
structure and function . 

Another thing that never ' 
occured to me was that mental 
attitude plays an important 

Beckley Article 
Labeled 'Libelous' 
Editor: 

Your front page article on Dean Beckley (Wednesday. 
September 27) was in extremely poor taste. if not libelous. There 
are public charges against Beckley: running up gambling debts is 
not among them. 

To report as news rumor and innuendo about a man's personal 
life is not responsible journalism. it is cheap sensationalism. If this 
is the kind of trasb we can expect for the coming year. perhaps The 
Guardian needs a watchdog.

part in your perfonnance as a 
student ana as a human being. 
It took a year and a half for me 
to wander down to the beach 
and look at the sunset or to 
touch and smell the fl(lwers or 
just to stop someone I knew and 
say, "Hi. how are you." then 
bother to stay and fisten to their 
answer. 

My freshman year was one of 
anxiety. frustration and ex-
treme stress. Frankly. as much 
jiS I loved science I wasn' t very 
happy studying it all the time. 
And. in spite of all the help I 
received from my professors 
and TA ·s. the A's weren ' t 
coming as much as I had 
believed they would. This only 
served to frustrate me more. 

At the end of my freshman 
year. during finals week. I 
collapsed in the library and was 
taken to Scripps Hospital. The 
pressure. most of which I put on 
myself. was finaUy too much 
for me. In the ambulance I got 
hysterical. Suddenly. I found 
myself trapped in this web I had 
spun and didn't know how to get 
out. I can remember fervently 
wishing to die. I was unhappy. 
and to myself. I was a failure. 

Well. I didn't die. Whether it 
was the natural instinct to 
survive that pulled me together 
or some inner strength I didn't 
realize was there. I did manage 
to get back the will to live and 
make something of my life. 

Around this [ime I met an 
extremely perceptive pro-
fessor. I never told him what I 
had gone through that past 
year. He understood this web in 
which I had entangled myself 
without my telling him. This 
professor told me to take a look 
at successful students and see 

how they s~nt their time. They 
were studying their hard core 
subjects as well as doing things 
they liked. 

I decided to try it. · 
Tentatively planning my 

sophomore schedule. I was 
careful to include extracur-
ricular activities and some 
liberal art courses. I also 
started doing the things I loved 
to do but had given up when I 
entered college. I rode horses. 
started p.laying the piano again 
and triea to watch the sunset at 
least once a week. I indulged in 
Tolstoy and Gibrahan. I even joined a P.E. class. And (he 
third week of winter quarter. I 
took an entire weekend off and 
went skiing! 

My sophomore year is over 
now . This time. I made it 
through finals week in one 
piece. The A's are coming now 
and more important than my 

~rades. yes. I do mean more 
Important. I'm much bappier 
now. I'm planning my junior 
schedule similar to my sopho-
more one. 

Perhaps. I shouldn' t have 
begun WIth. "My experience as 
a once hard-nosed. dedicated 
premed student." I am still a 
dedicated student and still plan 
to go into medicine. What I am 
not. is hard-nosed. 

My experience has taught me 
the Importance of being a total 
human being . And that is 
something I shall never forget.

notic~ the earlier payment. and fail to reimburse me. or worse yet. 
send It back to the insurance company. I would be sure not to be 
paid. in that case. She told me I would just have to be patient. and 
trusting. 

So. two days before reading the headline above Ben Fahy's 
letter to this newspaper. I received the first of what is going to be a 
long, drawn out. agonized process - the letter preceding the 
arrival of creditors .. .invasion of my privacy. (I work on campus. 
so the university is sure to cooperate) . Payment has not been 

mad~ to the hospital . the doctor. or myself. I cannot afford to pay 
the bIll. and never expected I would have to. The insurance lady 
keeps telling me to wait a few more weeks. The hospital people 
tell me the insurance company has been ignoring a lot of student 
claims lately. 

Therefore. contrary to what the UCSD catalog. the Health 
Center brochure. or any dean might tell you. insurance benefits for 
students are extremely uncertain. If you must become ill. make 
sure you have Blue Cross. Kaiser. or some other alternative. 
Above all. don't trust your student insurance. unless you can 
afford to pay your health bills yourself.

SHARM EL SHEIK, Occu-
pied Sinai - Yaacov Bar-Levy 
came to the southern tip of the 
Slnai . Peninsula to get away 
(rom it all, but the Camp David 
accords mean he probably will 
have to leave his sun-baked 
utopia for the sake of peace. 

Bar-Levy , a 31 -year-old 
mechanical engineer, is one of 
many Israelis whose life on 
occupied Arab land may be 
disrupted because of Mideast 
peace agreement signed by 
Prime Minister Menachem 
Beein and Egyptian President 
Anwar Sadat at far off Camp 
David, Md. 

Bar-Levy didn 't move to 
Sharm El Sheik with any 
political aims. 

"I saw no way I could waste 
my energy in the city, rushing 
to t~e office, waiting for 
stoplights, running after all the 
exhibitionism of clothing, 
furniture and other material 
things, " he said. 

So in 1976 he gave up his job in 
Haifa and brought his wife, 
Zavit, to the settlement of 
Ophira where it's summer most 
oj the year the temperatures 
can top 110 degrees; 

The Bar-Levys run a youth 
hostel that serves thousands of 
diving enthusiasts that come to 
Sharm El Sheik for the under-
water wonderland off the Red 
Sea coast. 

" It Was clear to us that we 
couldn't stay here forever," he 
said. " But it's one thing if we 
reached the conclusion our-
selves and another if the 
government comes and tells us 
to leave. But of course it's a 
positive thing - for peace -
there's no question that we'd 
leave. 

"For an Israeli no peace 
means war, and war means 
death. We've have too much of 
that already." 

The Ophira settlement, with 
a population of 300 families , 
was started six years ago to 
house military personnel. But

investors also wanted to 
capitalize on the tourist poten-
tial of the area. The town is as 
miles south of the Israeli port 
city of Eilat and too far away to 
receive Israeli telev isi on 
broadcasts. Newspapers arrive 
a day late and water is piped in 
from 50 miles away. 

" When you first come here 
you think this is the end of the 
world," said Bar-Levy. " But 
after you're here awhile you see 
how much fuller life can be." 

Moshav Neviot, about half-
way between Eilat and Sbarm 
El Sheik, is another budding 
resort that attracts thousands 
of Israeli and European tour-
ists seeking the sun and the 
coral-lined beaches along the 
Gulf of Aqaba. 

" I think it wouldn' t be a 
tragedy if Sadat would agree to 
allow a settlement like this to

"controlled burnin.". bill to 
encoura.e landowners to help 
prevent disastrous wildland 
fires has been slped by Gov. 
Edmund Brown Jr. 

At University and State Employees Credit Union your savings will earn at least ~ 
per annum more than any bank on comparable fixed term accounts (from 6 months 
to 8 _years), and at least }4% more than those same accounts at your savings and 
loan. The difference is even greater when you compare our regular savings plan . 

The idea is to bum bulld-ups 
of dead underbrush during 
damp weather, thUi depriving 
potential hot-weather acci-
dental fires of much of their 
fuel. 

The bill, sitned Tuesday, 
appropriates $155,000 to hire 
and equip state crews to stand 
by durin. the burning. 

The bill, AB 1006 by Assem-
blyman Barry Keene (D-Elk), 
also says that landowners who 
comply with a state-developed 
plan for controlled burning 
won't be billed for suppression 
costs If the fire gets out of hand . 

An aide to Keene, Greg 
deGiere, said landowners may 
now practice controlled burn-
ing, but not often because the 
state cannot supply standby 
crews. 

Keene said the new Jaw will

brush lands , and save the 
taxpayers millions of dollars in

Shuttle Space For Experiment 
By Doul Camploa 

SdneeEdl .... 
suuestiol18 are being sougbt 

for an experiment to fill five 
cubic feet of room aboard ODe of 
the early fligbts of the NASA 
Space Sbuttle, Enterprise. 
Quest/7a, the organization 
which reserved tbe Shuttle 
space, will donate it to the 
designer of the project itjudies 
to best utilize the opportunity 
for experimentation beyond the 
confine. of the earth and its 
atmosphere. 

According to Questl7a, ideas 
from all fields will be con-
sidered: "from astrophysics to 
medicine, economics to molec-
ular biology." The only limita-
tions on the project are those of 
size. The necessary apparatus 
must occupy a space no larger 
than five cubic feet and must 
weigh less than 200 pounds.

Laetrile 
Examined 
By National 
Institute 

By Cb .... Connell 
AIIocla&ed Prell Writer 

WASHINGTON - The Na-
tional Cancer Institute wants to 
test Laetrile on several ad-
vanced cancer patients in an 
effort to resolve "once and for 
aJl" the debate about the 
controversial substance, the 
institute's director announced 
Wednesday. 

Dr. Arthur C. Upton said a 
human trial was justified in thf 
wake of a recent, inconclusivE 
review of the medical recorru 
of patients who used Laetrile 
which some claim is a cancer 
cure. 

The institute launcbed a 
nationwide appeal for records 
from Laetrile patients last 
,January. It got t3 respoDlet, 
but only Z2 provided aU the 
necessary recorda and involved 
patients who bad used only 
Laetrile. Of those 22, six cancer 
patients who used Laetrile 
showed improvement, Dine 
stayed the same, and seven got 
worse. 

The Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, which has led a federal 
fight against Laetrile, still 
must approve the Cancer 
Institute's plan to use Laetrile 
in the human experiment. FDA 
Commissioner Donald Ken-
nedy said he did not believe the 
institute's review of the 22 
cases "demonstrates any 
effectiveness of Laetrile." 

But Kennedy added, "there 
are other reasons that we all 
recognize that a controlled 
clinical trial might be desirable 
and NCr has been persuaded by 
them." 

The FDA has been under 
pressure from Laetrile sup-
porters who want the substance 
tested. Kennedy said the FDA 

~ould review the ca ncer 
Institute's request obj ctively 
and decide "as quickly as 
pO sible." 

Upton noted that proponents 
of Laetrile claimed 50,000 to 
70,000 Americans have used the 
ubstance. which i made from 

tfhe, pits of apricots and other 
rultS. 

ments should hold some poten-
tial benefit for mankind, either 
in the Imowledie obtained by 
performinl the experiment or 
in the application of that 
Imowlele. 

Submi88ions of experiment 
ideas should include a des-
cription of the project itself 
(about 500 worda), diagrams 
for clarification where needed, 
and a summary of the de-
signer's knowledge and ex-
perienc,: in the field . This , 
along With a stamped, self-
addressed envelope, should be 
sent by October 1. to: Quest178 
Space Shuttle Experiment, 1133 
Avenue of the Americas, New 
York, New York 10036. 

The Space Shuttle Program 
offers scientists an excellent 
opportunity to experiment in 
conditions that are not easily 
duplicated on earth. For the 
first few flights, the major 
difference will be the absence 
oC the force of gravity. This 
one alteration of the -environ-
ment could be used to provide a 
control - a standard for 
comparison to "normal proce-

dures" - in experiments such 
as the study of the life cycle and 
learning behavior of certain 
organisms. 

There's no proof anyone's out 
there, he contends. 

Even is we do pick up a 
signal, he says, it could have 
been sent millions of years ago 
from a long-dead civilization. . 

"What do we do if we get it," 
asks one Capitol Hill aide , 
"send a mailgram?" 

NASA proponents are tired of 
such wisecracks . They em-
phasized to the committee that 
the project would lead to 
advances in radio astronomy. 
But they also say it needs to be 
launched now because growing 
interference from our own 
communications systems will 
make sensitive detection of 

. signals difficult in a few years. 
At the hearings, Dr. Noel 

Hinners , NASA's associate 
administrator for space 
science, conceded, "The 
chance of success is very small, 
but the rewards of success 
would be very great. " 

Even sisnals picked up from 
a dead Civilization could be 
valuable. the program's ad-

vocates Claim. Tney liken 
potential messages from outer 
space to the bOoks of Greek 
Civilization. " Does Sen. Prox-
mire suggest we throw out all 
books written by those who are 
now dead? " asks a NASA 
rejoinder issued earlier this 
year. 

Among the more fascinating 
documents in the proponents' 
research arsenal is a Library of 
Congress study, " The Pos-
sibility of Intelligent Life 
Elsewhere in the Universe. " 
The 1975 study, revised' last 
year. includes results of 
scientific surveys . but also 
includes r.oetry, science fiction 
and fanCiful drawings of outer-
space creatures. 

The study extolls the po-
tential benefits of celestial 
messages but warns : " We 
should necessarily have to be 
cautious in accepting any 
advice initially. but in Hie long 
run. the possibilities are 
titillating ... 

It worries that the alien 
beings might try to fool us by 
"transmitting messages that 
appear beneficient, while their 
intentions were malevolent." 

The report also outlines 

future directions lDter-stellar 
communication might take, as 
well as· possible drawbacks. 
Mere radio communication 
doesn't hold much promise, the 
study says. We'dhavetowaitat 
least 48,000 years for an answer 
from some distant star to a 
signal sent in 1974. "There may 
be no one left on Earth to 
receive their answer, and all 
would have been in vain. " 

Ideally, the best method to 
communicate would be to send 
astronauts in spacecraftbsays 
the study. There's one itch, 
though . The occupants mi~ht 
not survive the journey which 
could take thousands of years. 
One solution would be to 
develop a vehicle that travels 
up to the speed of light to slow 
down aging . Or hibernation or 
suspended animation could be 
used. 

All that ' s still far in the 
future , however. For now , 
NASA is asking funding for 
what it believes is a mode!'t, 
sensible, low-cost program. 

But indications are that if 
somebody out there is trying to 
contact Congress, most mem-
bers aren't hstenmg. 

There is more than one secret at · • •

NASA Searches For Extraterreitrlal Dollars 
By Art Levbte . 

hdIIe News 8ervIee 
Is somebody out there trying 

to tell UI somethint? 
Tbe National Aeronautic. 

and Space Adminl.tration 
(NASA) tbiDkI so. The a,eDC)' 
wanta American taxpayen to 
spend '14 million over the next 
seven yean trying to plck up 
alien broadca.t si,nals be-
cause they beUeve there'. a 
good cbance intelligent life 
exists in outer .pace. 

But Conaresa doesn't agree, 
and NASA ia facinl the pos-
sibility that funds for the new 
program wUl be cut. 

Advocates of the Search for 
Extraterrestrial Intellilence 
(SETI) proaram are undaunt-
ed. Last week (Sept. 20 and 21) 
they alain made their case 
before a House Science sub-
committee. NASA's budget 
request for t2 million to start 

' the program was approved by 
Congress last year, but this 
year appropriations commit-
tes in both houses cut the funds . 
Sen . William Proxmire , D-
Wis . , even singled out the 
program for his " Golden 
F leece Award ." 

(Art Levine is a contributing 
edi tor of the Washington 
Monthly magazine.) 

Now NASA officials are 
showing the kind of plucky 
detennination that landed a 

man on the mOOD. They won't 
live up. Tbey atill have IU~ 
porteR in Coqreu and the 
aclentiflc community, includ-
inI celebrity utrooomer Dr. 
Carl Saaan. 

Since the 1110'1, Ruaian and 
American acientiats have made 
aeveral attemptl to pick up 
si8nalJ' from civllt&ations in 
outer apace. But, al8l, they 
haven't heard anything yet. 

Are those outer space beings 
merely shy, afraid to say 
"howdy" to the planet Earth? 

Probably not, says NASA. In 
one of its publications, the 
a,ency notes, "Other civili-
zations, too, could be searching 
for intellilent companions." 
The scientist. say previous 
listening attempta have failed 
beca~ our radio telescopes 
were beamed on too narrow a 
spectrum of stars and fre-
quencies. The SETI program 
would be an all-sky, all-signals 
search using existing and new 
technology . 

Although subcommittee 
members expressed prelimina-
ry support after the hearings, 
Sen. Proxmire isn't impressed. 
And , as chairman of the 
appropriations subcommittee 
that hasjurisdi(ition over NASA 
funds , his views carry a good 
deal of weight. 

" There is no urgency to fund 
this effort in fiscal 1979, or 
fiscal 2079. for that matter," he 

say.. "It should be postponed 
until riJbt after the federal 
budlet ia balanced and income 
and Social Security taxes are 
reduced to zero." 

Later SbuWe fliChts will be 
capable of allowing a greater 
variation of environment by 
exposing experiments dlreeUy 
to t~e hanh conditions of space. 
A natural vacuum, and the 
presence of a great deal of 
ultraviolet radiation and high 
energy particles (usually 
absent at the earth's surface 
due to the "filtering" effect of 
the atmoapbere) will become 
available for study. 

The fact that the shuttle and 
ita cargo can return to earth 
means that knowledle may be 
gained not only from the data 
obtained in space, but from the 
returning experimental equip-
ment and subjects, also. 

The first six flights of the 
Space Shuttle will serve simply 
to verify the system itself. The 
first mission will carry just a 
data analysis system, while the 
next five will hold payloads of 
scientific experiments. Each 
flight is capable of bringing 300 

. to 100 experiments into space. 
That is, there will be more 
experiments on each of the first 
flights of the Enterprise than on 
all previous manned space 
flights combined.

Triton -Soccer Team S 
Last Year's 3-2 Playoff 

By Joa GoelZ 
Hopine to avenge last year's

Fresno Pacific, the Triton 
soccer team faces Fresno alain 
Saturday at Muir Field in a 3: 00 
game. 

UCSD's 3-1 lea cue finish put 
them in the first round of the 
1977 NAIA playoffs. UCSD 
pushed allead l~ and 2-1 durinl 
the lame, but Fresno rallied to 
tie the acore at two at the end of 
regulation play . After 10 
minutes of sudden deatb 
overtime, Fresno put in the 
wlnninlloal. 

Eilht Triton veterana of that 
game will be .uitinl up for the 
rematch tomorrow and their 
emotioDl should be runninl 
hiJh. "We've lot a little rivalry 
,oin, with them," said coach 
Stewart Hayes, "but they've 
beaten U8 more times than 
we've beaten them." 

The squad will be rely in, on 
quick forwarda Gret LyoDl and

Despite their slow start, 
Coach Hayes Is optimistic 
about the season. "We could be 
very IUcceaaful this year," he 
said. "With this team we can

playoffs - but we'll have to

The coach believes that the 
players' attitude. could be the 
key to a succeaaful season. 
"The most important thing is to 
keep motivation high. A win 
draws the group together . 
When we lose, bowever, the 
team has all kinds 01 lDtemal 
problems. It's my job to help 
them understand what's hap-

The Tritons must remain 
spirited to win against the 
better teams they will play ,

~Because there's going to be nothing straight about a CHEECH & CHONG film . 

Every generation has had their own comedy duo; the JO's had Laurel and Hardy. 
Abbott & Costello broke up the 40's and Martin and Lewis really fractured the 50's. 

CHEECH & CHONG have helped make the 70's go "UP IN SMOKE_" 
CHEECH & CHONG are the comedy team that gave birth to rock comedy 
and in the process of turning on a whole ge~eration, sold ten million albums, 

picked up numerous awards, including Cash Box and Billboard's best comedy duo, 
and a Grammy for their album, "Los Cochinos." 

Now it's time for a CHEECH & CHONG movie. 
C & C's "UP IN SMOKE" will make you feel very funny. 

So don't go straight to see this movie!

'Girlfriends' Is Not Funny 

San Diego Ski Chalet's

SKI SfLE! 
SATURDAY. SUNDAY . 
0cIIIIIr7 ..... 

By JW I.otUe Buetey 
C.&rIbII&Ia, g_ 

Tbe publicity pboto from 
GIrUrleada ahows an attractive 
YOUDI woman carryinl a 
portfoUo and lookinlsomewhat 
wlltfully askance. Tbi. seems 
to .ulle.t that the film IIgoinl 
to be a lyrical account of 
something haviDl to do with 
arti.t.' portfoUos and pretty 
women. 

It doe. have to do with artiatl' 
portfolios. But the heroine , 
Susan Weinblatt, played by 
Melanie Mayron, is a frump. 
And her life is frumpy. And 
GlrlfrieaU is a frumpy film. 

GIrUrlends, made and pro-
duced by three women, was 
fUDded by the National EDdow-
ment for the Arts and several 
other organizations, and ! ben 
released by Warner Brothers 
under a cloud of publicity hype. 
(IncludiDl the miraculously 
flattering sUlI of Mayron) . 
Tbll, presumably, to compen-
sate for the vacuousness of the 
film itself, 

The movie, directed by 
Claudia Weill, has no real 
compelling story line. It i. 
slmply that Susan, a photoe-
rapher, doesn't have any 
friends. Incidents that could 
develop Into something inter 
estinJ, Ute the almoet-arrair 
with a married rabbi, become , . 
cul-de-sac. of emptlnell. 
Wone, there Ja DO attempt to 
explain why themes are bepn, 
and then dropped. Apia the 
rabbi, wbo I. SOisb, ts an 
example, Tbe value of bis 
presence in Glrllrle ••• is 
dubious. The neceaaity of bia 
secretary speakine witb a 
heavy lrisb broJUe Ja even 
more so. Tbis, I IUppoIe, Ja 
meant to be funny, as Ja the 
incident where Susan cuaaea 
.. Jesu.! .. in front of the rabbi. 

But contrivances are not 
funny, and I manaeed to 
anticipate the punch Une in 
almost every joke. In fact, all 
the Une. of dialo,,", in Glrl-
frteDCIs follow a logical suc-
cession of mediocrity, and it is 
easy to gueas what each 
character i. going to say next .. 
Unfortunately, what the char- . 
actera do say does not match 
the movements of their Ups. I 
would have liked to have 
worked as a languaee. con-
sultant when Girlfriends was 
beiDl overdubbed - I'm pretty 
good at translating English into 
English.

Record Reviews 
Lions 

Bridsb Lions - "British Lions" 
(RSO) 

Most of the instrumental end 
of Mott the Hoople got together 
with a singer and lead guitarist 
to make this album and tour it 
- I doubt that it will go farther 
than that. This is not to say they 
don't play good rock and roll; 
songs like "Eat the Rich" and 
"Break This Fool" pump as 
bard as anything Mott ever did, 
and the " rock star ballads' 
come off equally well , but their 
bellicosity seems a bit con-
trived (as did Mott's but you 
always knew Ian Hunter meant 
1&). Listening to International 
Heroes, one gets the idea that 
they are aware of the ridicu-
lousness and bypocrisy of their 
professional disaffection. Still, 
they're much better than 
Foreigner. 

Heads 
Talking Heads - "More Sonp 
About Buildiap and Food" 
(Sire) 

David Byrne bas mutered 
the mechanics of Patti Smith's 
"Radio· Ethiopia" idea (ie, 
disjointed proselytizing against 
the backJl'Ound of a steady 
beat. minamal chord changes); 

the similarity ends with the 
idea. Rather than bludgeoning 
the listener, the music sets off 
the lyrics, allowing them to 
insinuate themselves gently 
into the nervous system. 'Brian 
Eno, instrumentally unobtru-
sive, does wonders for their 
"sound," through his pro-
duction; he smoothens the 
band's frenetic choppiness in 
just tbe rigbt places, not 
sacrificinc angst for aesthetic 
(aestbetic?) on the choppy 
songs, while allowing the full 
potential of such soothing, 
mystical tunes as "Take Me to 
the River" and "The Big 
Country" to come through . 
Well done .. 

Badlands 
Badlaads - Bill Chinook 
(AUantic) 

Bill Chinook's first album, 
Badia"', sounda like he's from 
the streets of toughtown USA, 
or at least from South Jersey, 
any place urban, not Maine 
(where be's the number one 
local rock and roller) . Chi-
nook'a voice could win him the 
Bob Seger SOUDCI-alike contest, 
and bis lyrical themes are 
mildly rernini8cent of Bruce 
SpriDpteen. ChiDook, tboulh, 
comes shlnln, through with a 
rock-aolid Ityle of his own.

Airplane Phobia- the Silverbellied Beauties 

By JW LoedIe lIueIey 
CeaIriMUq Edt .. 

Monday, September25,l971: 
two airpiaDes collide over San 
Die,o. Fearin, my motber 
~ 'ligbt become bysterical if she 
liappened to diacover news of 
this on the back page of some 
provincial newspaper, I tele-
phoned her home in AUltralia to 
say I was stl11 alive. Two bours 
later, she and her sister 
perched in front of the tele-
vision set and watched the 
details'OIl the midday news - a 
BBC broadcast via satellite. It 
wu only ,an hour earlier that I 
had seen and heard the very 
same story on the CBS evening 
new •. ODe hour after the entire 
United States became aware of 
this diauter, every housewife 
in AU8tralia watcbinl the telly 
and drinldn, ber noontime 
cuppa tea also found out. 

Ne ... traveia quickly. So do 
my airplanes - so quickly that 
I sometimes forget them. But 
this moming I do not forget 
them. I am up early writing and 
hearing the valUe rumblin,s of 

Salt Lake City is the only one 
that amYeI anud 1 o'clock. 
So I wait for it by my. picture 
window. A strealdng "W" and a 
red line means airline pas-
seDler rescue operations go 
into effect. If he bu luua,e I 
sit 5 minutes, if not, I ,et up and 
.go to pick b1m up immediately. 
We hafe never missed - he is 
alwaYI there on the curb, 
looldnc like the world's .most 
self-assured traveler, knowing 
that I have never kept him 
waiting more than 2 minutes. 

My great, indeltructible 
pa .. ion is for 7471. The inflat-
able model I bought in Uttle 
Tokyo attests to this - It still 
hangs, all 3 feet of it, from the 
ceiling in the spare bedroom. 
We do not see 747s in San Diefo. 
At lealt, rarely. The day I fel in 
love with them, I was in the 
back yard lurreptitiously 
borrowing blooms from my 
Italian neighbor's lilac tree. 
Slowly the sky darkened. A 
rumbler wu coming - the 
quietest rumbler I had ever 
'heard. I looked up and all I 

"Now that I know better, now that I completely distrust the airplanes, I 
ignore the scheduling ... " 

taktH>rfs. The curfew has been 
lifted almost two hours now and 
any other day I would not have 
recalled a single landing. I 
learned to ignore the sound that 
streakl palt in the early 
moming, thougb the source is 
only balf a block over and 
maybe 300 feet up. 

Eveninp were different. I 
used to stretcb out by the living-
room w:.ldow, feet up, a cool 
~ in band, and watch my 
malDifieent aluminum birds 
wUIi the curioalty of a modern-
day Audibon . A number of 
screechers would zip by high up 
- Lear jets and small 737s 
painted funny colors. Exple-
tives poured from my lips. But 
then, finally, what I had been 
waitinc for - a quiet blue 
rumbler would pus over very 
slowly and etrortiessly, vanish-
ing just in time for my room-
mate to pounce, "quick, what 
wal that?" 

"LlOll," I would say' in a 
hurry, tryin, to beat the 
imaginary clock by avoiding, 
" Lockheed 1011 Tri-star -
Delta." Only Delta flies these 
silverbellied beauties anyway. 

Later, at bedtime, I occa-
sionally lifted up the shades so 
that I might see the headlights 
pass slowly through my room 
and over my body, IlghUn, first 
my legs, then my torso and 
finally diaappearing. My affair 
witll the birds coulc last as late 
as 12 midnight, but even then, 
one or two would usually sneak 
in after curfew. Caught a 
Western at 2: 30 am just last 
Saturday night. 

The schedules do not make 
note of these nocturnal birds. I 
believe I have every airline 
schedule, and at one point I 
tried to combine them all into a 
single chart so that I could 
know where each plane came 
from and whether or not it 
secreted champagne . The 
effort wallutile - it seemed no 
plane ever landed on time. I had 
Americans when I should have 
had Uniteds, Deltas inatead of 
Nationala - a real me ... 

Now that I know better, now 
that I comrletely diatrust the 
airplanes, ignore the sched-
ules and count on one thing: my 
father's Western Oight from 

could see was airplane: An 
airplane with a gigantic broken 
nose gliding almost silently 
over the antennas on its 
approach to a runway much too 
short for safety. My ancient 
nei,hbor came out of her house 
croaking emotionally in Ital-
ian, "aereo! aereo!" I hid the 
lilac behind my back and 
nodded aaent at every pause in 
her monologue. But my mind 
was on the quiet, wbitebellied 
giant . I loved it, and its 
bravery. And, I never saw it 
again. Yet my love lasted and 
lasted, al such loves do. 

Tuesday, September 26,1971. 
I am ,lad Boeing 747s do not fiy 
into tbe San Diego Internation-
al Airport. Angry and deceiVed, 
I will curse rumblers and 
screamers alike tbese days. 

Only the 747 is spared my wrath 
over the 727 and the Cessna. 
The jumbo jet, at least, has 
nothing to do with yesterday's 
break with routine - with 
yesterday's departure from the 
splendor and grace of an 
airplane approaching land at a 
gentle angle. I 

My airplanes - the birds of 
prey, the carrion foul , will 
swoop past me mercllessly 
from now on. I feel this as a 
torment in my heart. I regard 
each one with the hatred that is 
only grown out of having once 
loved. But I will not leave my 
vain, painted birds. They will 
not defeat me. Let them move. I 
look forward to the day when I 
see each one tagged, mutilated 
by a carelessly place smear of 
dye, and sent to a sanctuary on 
Otay Mesa.

fairly elaborate - the "Dave's

dramati&ation of an existential

Still. the Jow about freezinl

mOlt typical. 

We asked Cbeecb ' why 00

"Because tbey make you

"Don't 10 straight to see tbia

While Up In Smoke is prob-

hard to avoid thinkinI that it 
would've been mucb funnier in

because at the time he actually

because drup are becomiq

Clearing Robert Kennedy's Image 
Roben KeDDedy ud RIa TImet 
by ~ar M. Selllnlqer 
HoapIGD MiIfIID Co_ t •• __ 

I met Bobby Kennedy the 
nilbt before he was shot. It was 
at . the end of the California 
primary in June '68 and he had 
been campajCing tbroulhout 
the sta te t at day. First 
tbroup northern California. 
tben down to L.A. and finally. 
after a motorcade tt:"ough 
Logan Heights. the EI ~ortez 
Hotel for a party for the 
campaign workf:fS. But when it 
came time for his speech. he 
merely mumbled a few well-
worn platitudes and then 
turned the stage over to Andy 
Williams who sang while 
Kennedy slumped off the one 
side of the sta,e and buring his 
face in his lap. 

He seemed terribly aloof and 
distant and I resented this 
standoffish attitude toward his 

campailo volunteers. It was 
ooly later that I found out that 
he WII phyatcally exhausted 
and had beeD beavlq in the 
bathroom of the EI Cortea oaly 
momenta before. But by then it 
was too late of coursej because Robert KeDDedy haa bis We 
snuffed out in the kitcben 
corridor of the Ambassador 
Hotel in Los Anlel .. the next 
night. I brine tbia up because it 
illustrates the miaunderataad-
ing tbat haunted Kennedy 
througbout his Jife. He was 

c onstantly being perceived as a 
" ruthless " opportunist tbat 
used his constituancy to further 
his own political goals. The 
new book by Arthur Schlesing~ 
er. Ro~rt KelUledy and His 
TimeS'. is a massive (1.000 
page) attempt to clarify RFK's 
muddled image in history and 
is an attempt to be the defini-
tive study of the "lost presi-
dent." 

Yet because Schlesinger tries 
to include everytltiDJ in his 
portrait he loses the basic 
tbread of a eood writer; 
ImowiDI what to leave out. The 
book suffers from beiDI too 
partisan towards ita subject. 
Kennedy'l mistakes are 
brushed aside while his tri-
umphs are well pointed out. 
Schlesinger is too scholarly a 
writer to bring to life tbe 
passion of the man. a better 
writer might have been the 
more objective David Halber-
stam whose short volume, The 
Unfinisbed Odyasey of Rober1 
KeDnedy. remains the best 
monograph on the enigmatic 
Bobby K. , or the outrageous-
aess of Mailer who captured 
Kennedy brilliantly in Miami 
and &be Siege of Chic810 and his 
times in the classic Armies of 
&be Ni",t. Kennedy became

staotiy teatiq himself and his 
courage until he pushed it too 
far. For the remarkable thine 
about Robert Kennedy was his 
remarkable capacity for 
growth. His world was shat-
tered after his brother died and 
he developed a kind of Christian 
fatalism towards the " terrors 

coalition he was able to estab-

who could reinvent himself and

posed too much of a threat to 
the status quo and he became 
the victim of a gangland hit. 
Yet this is an upJiftiog book

life force of the man whose 
spirit suffuses the heart of this 
memoir and continues to send

941 Pearl St. (Pearl & Girard) 454--9445 

At first I was very scared. 
The World War II vintage 

glider plane did not look quite 
safe. It was small and the 
instrumentation was sparce 
and the pilot and the paasenger 
sat on wooden slats. It looked no 
more airworthy than my '66 
Valiant. 

Mike Slater of the UCSD 
Soaring Club was to be my pilot 
and be assured me tbe plane 
was safe. With nothing to do but 
believe him I smiled and said 
"I'll take your word for it" as I 
climbed into the thing. 

After a quick flight lesson, 
the cockpit closed over us and 
the tow line was attached. On 
our signal the pilot of the small 
plane gunned his engine, the 
tow line went taught and we 
skidded off behind him down 
the dusty Lake Elsinore glider 
port runway. 

Before I could think to let out 
my breath, which I had been 
holding, we were airborn. 

We followed the tow plane up. 
As it climbed we climbed, 
circling upward over the lake. 

At 5000 feet Mike gave the 
signal to me and I pulled hard 
on the red release knob in front 
of me, just as he had instructed 
me to do while we were on the 
ground. 

The plane banked sbarply 
down and to the left and we 
were free. 

We flew for what seemed like 
a very sbort time, though I was 
told on the ground that it had 
been about 40 minutes. 

One maneuver we did has 
stayed in my mind . . 

It was what Mike called a 
"wingover." He let the plane 
dive and then pulled it straight 
back up . After this roller 
coaster motion be banked a 
sharp left tum, sending the 
wing perpendicular to the 
ground, as the plane swung 
sharply around. 

During all this . Mike was 
giving out a yell, of the sort 
Pickett's confederates were 
reported to have given as they 
charged the Union guns at 
Gettysburg. 

I was captivated. The yell 
did not diatract me. All the 
cannons on Cemetery Ridge 
could have thundered at once 
and still not bave broken my 
trance. . 

At the end of the wingdown, 
as the plane swuDl sbarply 
around, I gasped and I think I 
smiled, I bad DO · fear as I 
watched the sky whizzing by, 
like a streak of Union Blue.

Nader claimed tbat corpor-
ations are "sbaplq our value 
sYltema." "They are reacbiq 
into tbe minds of our cbUdren. 
We lee matters through the 
corporation's eye .... 

One example, Nader said, is 
that we view car fatalities and 

iJ~uries as a result of human 
t error rather than as a function 
• of car desip. 

• 'Can concentrated corporate 
power be consistent with a 
democratic system?" he 
asked. "Corporations get along 
well with dicatators - they 
have an authoritarian streak in 

them, they keep the 'peasants' 
down." 

Nader accused tbe mass 
media al being caught up in a 
hiP degree of trivia. When 
uled bow many persons knew 
of Herbert York, a chief arms 
control advocate currently 
teaching at UCSO, two Guard-

College Induced Depression 
Is Common At San Diego 

By Dall St, Claire BaCOD 
Most students, at some point 

in their college career, become 
infected with a disease es-

~cially at UCSD. 
The symptoms are loss of 

sleep and overall distress. You 
find that you can't do your 
work , you are performing 
inadequately and you feel that 
no one cares about you. Ac-
cording to Dr. Ricbard White-
hill, director of Counseling and 
Psycbological Services, you 
are experiencing "college 
induced depression." It results 
from higb personal standards, 
a competitive environment and 
social isolation. 

" You can get a good edu-
cation at UCSD," Whitebill 
stated, "but this is not a 
university community. While 
students are growing into 

independent adults, a lot of the ness training. Students wishing 
things that let them know to participate in group sessions 
where they' re at are not here. . 
The only people protected are this. year should contact C~un­
usually those working in cause- sehr:tg and PsychologIcal

number of people infected with inte~ests: "~':lr central goal is 
" college induced depression" helpmg mdlvlduals, groups or 
every year. "A good half of our 
work doesn't deal with mental 
illness," Whitehill said, "but 
witb normal problems and 
normal questions. We deal with 
loneliness, social isolation, 
anxiety that probibits per· 
formance and sexuality." 

The Center holds individual 
and group sessions. In the past 
they've had groups dealing 
with ethnic issues, social 
awareness, test anxiety, hu-
man sexuality and assertive-

fashion that is productive, 
growth-oriented and satis-
fying," explained Whitehill. He 
noted that the psychologists

fields which are already under 
construction. 

work with people so that they 
can become self-reliant and 
therefore there are no long-
term treatments. Services are 
on a totally confidential basis. 

Whitehill quoted studies 
showing that "the more s0-
cially active a campus com-
munity is the less students use 
the Counseling and Psycho-
logical services. The less social 
activism the more students use 
the services." Social activities 
give people a better way to 
express themselves and some 
sense of adequacy, he said. "If 
you have something you're 
committed to ," Whitehill 
pointed out, "the commitment 
1~lf is self-sustaining." 

According to Whitehill this 
campus needs to work on 
broadening its curriculum, its 
social activities and defining 
what it has to offer to the 
student as far as career 
preparation. Part of what is 
holding the school back is 
funding. When the Regents 
distribute the money to the 
UCs, UCSD is near the bottom 
of the list, said Whitehill .

"Students are dying in other 

countries fighting fbr the rights 
students here take for ,ranted. 
Human resources of people in 
their late teens and early 
twenties are being wasted," 
Nader said. 

BusPermlt 
By Nancy Cavleke 

Students, faculty and staff 
members desiring free trans-
portation on San Die,o Transit 
buses within the boundaries of 
the UCSD campus must now 
present a Campus Bus Permit 
instead of their ID cards to the 
bus drivers. This free permit 
may be obtained at the Central 
Cashier's, Business, Housing 
" Food Services, or Parking 
Offices, and is valid during 
each quarter of the academic 
year. 

The San Diego Transit Ad-
ministration and the UCSD 
Business Office foresee a big 
reduction in problems with its 
implementation. Apparently, 
passengers who were unaware 
of the free ride boundaries and 
expected to travel further 
without paying caused dif-
ficulties in the past, as did the 
numerous types of valid 10 
cards, which made bus drivers 
quite confused. In the words of 
a San Diego Transit edminis-
trator, the new Campus Bus 
Permit "will eliminate argu-
ments between studentl,fac-
ulty and drivers," because the 
bus routes, the dates and the 
area for which the pass is 
effective are all spelled out on 
it. 

UCSD has enjoyed the "free 
wheels " between Scripps 
Institute and the Mesa Apart-
ments for the last nine years. 
Under the current contract 
UCSD pays the bus corporation 
$2,000 per month for the 
service, with the Housing and 
Food Administration paying 
fifty per cent of this and the 
Fines and Forfeitures and Reg 
Fee committees both con-
tributing twenty-five percent. 

A new sports and recreation 
facility, which would be funded 
by a $6-8 student fee, should be 
built at UCSD by 1981 , an 
administration study recom-
mends. 

The Recreation and Athletic 
Long Range Planning Commit-
tee, in a recent report to 
Chancellor William McElroy, 
urges immediate approval of 
the sports facility, which would 
need student approval in the 
upcoming refe~endum . 

The estimated cost for the 
new facilities is $1,945,000, plus 
operating and maintenance 
costs that bring the total cost to 
$2,295,000 after the first year of 
operation. Financ ing will 
directly affect the student body 
with a $6 to $8 special recrea-
additional costs will not be 
charged to students until 
construction of the sports area 
is completed. Beginning in the 
winter quarter of 1979, how-
ever, there will be a gift drive to 
raise an additional $1,000,000 
not provided for by the special 
student fee. 

'Student-O riented' Center 

The committee 's decision 
was based on what it terms the 
general student body's " keen 
awareness and need for health-
ful physical activities in 
recreation pursuiln and inter-
collegiate athletics " 

The committee, beaded by 
Ted W. Forbes, recommends 
that the site for the new 
recreational facilities be "east 
of the Central Libr.IIl")', north of 
Miramar Road an adjacent to 
the new recreatio field under 
construction." The proposed 
location would pmce the site

wbere it could ac,:commodate

Pending approval by Mc-
Elroy, the committee hopes to 
place the current issue for the 
rec facilities before the stu-
dents in a referendum in 
November. It is the opinion of 
Reg Fee Committee chairman 
Kenzie Nicole that the recom-
mended facilities will alfpear 
more favorable to the student 
body than did a previous sports 
faciUty proposal, defeated in 
the student referendum two 
yean ago.

A " definitely student-ori-
ented" convenience center and 
a "definitely La Jollan-ori-
ented" specialty center will be 
open to the community by the 
fall of 1979, according to 
Patricia Collum, UCSD cam-
pus and community planner. 

The shopping centers will be 
located south of tHe La Jolla 
Village Inn, west of 1-5, off of 
Villa La Jolla. 

The May Stores Shopping 
Center development will con-
sist of two separate complexes, 
including one and two-bedroom 
housing units, Collum said. 

The convenience center will 
contain a grocery market, drug 
store, record shop, movie 
theater, bank and two res-
taurants among other auorted 
.mall shops, accordin, to 
Collum. Nancy Cunningham, 
who workl in tbe lea.in, 
department of May StorM, aaid 
notbinc h.. been decided yet 
who will be lea.ing the stores 
in the convenience center. She 
added tbat May Stores i. 
focusing on the development of 
the .pecialty center at thi. 
time. 

Collum said UCSO Itudentl 
will benefit from the con-

venience center, as it will be 
" the first grocery center within 
walking distance of the Uni-
versity ." On the other hand, the 
specialty center is "deinitely 
not student-oriented," Collum 
added. 

Thirty-three two-bedroom 
apartments, will be built above 
the convenience center shops, 
Collum said. Rental rates have 
not y~t been established, 
according to Cunningham. 

" Probably a lot of students 
will rent these apartments," 
Collum added. 

The specialty center, located 
south of the convenience 
center, will be comprised of a 
May Co . store, Bullock ' s 
Wilshire - a high-fashion, 
highly-priced Bullock's - and 
several" specialty" shops, 
accordin, to Collum. One 
hundred and fifteen one-
bedroom apartment. will be 
built In the southweat corner of 
the center, Collum said. 

The residential units were 
planned originally to be two-
bedroom unit. IOld a. Itudent 
hou.ing. The developen made 
revi.lona in the plana, however, 
convertin, 75 two-bedroom 
unit. into 115 one-bedroom 
unit.. Collum and the UCSO 

Campus Community Planning 
Committee were opposed to the 
developers' changes in plans 
because "students can't afford 
to live in one-bedroom units." 

" The Planning Commission 
didn't approve the revised 
plans, so the developers ap-
pealed to tbe City Council and it 
was overruled,' Collum said. 

According to Collum, the 
community opposed the de-
velopment of a new shopping 
center "but the City Council, 
who is pro-development, voted 
6-1 in favor."
