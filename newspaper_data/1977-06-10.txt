Payoffs to Amateur Athletes Uncovered

University recruiters are 

promising high school and junior 
college athletes various illegal 
inducements in what amounts to a 
bidding war, and sometimes have 
not delivered, sources have told the. 

Judy Sweet can relax: no illegal 
payoffs were uncovered here. 

Interaction 
Seen as Key 
To Better .Reg 
Fee Panel 

by Mark Stadler 
Managing Editor 

The student co-chairperson of 
the 1977-78 Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee Programs has set 
increased communication between 
the committee and students as her 
primary goal for next year. 

"The students don't know what 
the committee is or what it does. 
They just know their registration 
fees are going up and they blame it 
on us~" Third College junior 
Marsha Harris said in an interview 
Monday. 

The 12-member committee, 
composed of seven students and 
five administrators makes 
recommendations On the uses and 
levels of all student fees to the 
Vice-chancellor and Dean of 
Student Affairs, who in tum ad-
vises the Chancellor. The com-
mittee is co-chalred by a student, 
elected by past student committee 
members, and a representative of 
the student affairs department. 

Allocates Reg Fee 
The committee is commonly 

called the reg fee committee 
because the bulk of its work con-
cerns the annual $360 registration 
fee . Programs and services funded 
by reg fee monielJ include student 
health services, recreational and 
intercollegiate athletics, planning 
and career placement, financial 
aid services and the student affairs 
branch. 

And it is the level and allocation 
of the registration fee that has 
caused the most controversy for 
the advisory committee this past 
year. 

The committee recommended a 
registration fee for 1977-78 of $131 
per quarter. That recom-
mendation-which was accepted by 
Chancellor McElroy-represented 
a compromJse between committee 
members, Harris said.

Triton Times in recent exclusive 
interviews. 

The sources, who are closely tied 
to the track and field and 
basketball scenes in Southern 
California, referred mainly to 
those sports but acknowledged 
similar activity in many other 
college areas. 

The information linked illegal 
maneuvers with track and field 
stars such as Dwiglt Stones and 
John Walker, the upper echelon of 
college basketball, as well as 
recruiters, scouts and coaches 
across the nahon. 

The sources, who all asked not to 
be identified, described a current 
collegiate sports picture that in-
cludes : 

-Recruiters enticing high school 
seniors and junior college athletes 
with money, equipment, jobs and a 
social life-all of which are illegal 
under National Collegiate Athletic 
Association (NCAA) rules-and 
often renege if the athlete does not 
perfonn up to expectations; 

-Pay-offs to women athletes, 

once non-existent, are now on the 
up-swing; 

-" Amateur" athletes, primarily 
in track and field, illegally be given 
money to perfonn in meets around 
the country; and 

-Academic work of the athletes 
often being taken care of through a 
variety of methods, often with the 
knowledge of professors. 

Stones Jumplog Up In World 
Other recent information has 

backed up the claims of the 
sources. The June 13 issue of Time 
magazine will identify high 
jumper Dwight Stones as being 
currently investigated by the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), 
and possibly owing as much as 
$50,000 in back income taxes. The 
income allegedly resulted from 
payments for performing in meets 
to the ex-Long Beach State star, 
which would have been illegal for 
Stones, who is still considered an 
amateur. 

The Michigan State student 
newspaper has alleged that Ohio 
State coaches have promised and 

paid money to recruits, paid police 
officers to transport prospective 
players. 

Though the amounts of similar 
activity. according to the sources, 
is prevalent in Southern California, 
it is relatively sparse in San Diego. 
While San Diego State University 
was said to have made "a few 
illegal moves," none were found 
at UCSD. The University of 
Southern California and San Jose 
State were named as two of the 
most blatantly illegal. 

Brent Clark, a NCAA rules en-
forcement representative, told the 
Triton Times that recruits can be 
given "anything commonly related 
to the educational experience. That 
includes room, board, tuition and 
books." Though Clark 
acknowledged a minimum of in-
fractions, he said, "We expect the 
universities to follow the rules and 
generally they do. When they don't, 
we are disappointed and we have to 
react." 

For some institutions, that 
reaction includes being barred 

from television and post-season 
tournaments f r various periods of 
time. 

Of the college recruiters, one 
source said, "They come to your 
house to sell you, and then later 
you get nothing. How is a high

Students Rally Again 
Against UC Holdings 

by Mark Stadler 
Managlog Editor 

UCSD communications professor Herb Schiller warned students 
yesterday against being tricked by the media into false arguments that a 
victory by black South Africans will lead to a suppression of human 
rights. 

"Anything people who have been dominated for 300 years do to liberate 
themselves from their oppressors is good. Rather than being a sup-
pression of human rights, it would be a cleansing of the poisons that have 
choked our system," Schiller said. 

Schiller was one of several speakers at a rally on Revelle plaza 
yesterday against UC investments in corporations that do business with 
the white supremist government of South Africa. It was the second such 
demonstration here in the past week, and was attended by about 200 
people. 

The rally was followed by a march of about 100 people through campus 
and the chancellor's complex, where the marchers filed peacefully past 
Chancellor McElroy's office, chanting and clapping. 

Wider Framework 
Schiller said the whole question of the South African struggle has to be 

seen in a wider framework than that of the media-or image-making 
context. 

"Nothing happens unless people do something," he said. 
Sihiller linked the recent concern expressed by the US government and 

I media over South African conditions to the increased struggle of South 
African blacks. Still, he said, the media will be presenting the same 
structure in different terms. 

"We have to keep our wits about us in order to deciphe e new terms 
., and not be misled by them," the communications professorsaid. 
~ Also speaking at the rally was sociology professor Gail Omvedt, who 
~ said she plans to resign her !>osition to protest UC involvement in South 
iii Africa. 
E Omvedt said the revolution of South African blacks is inevitable, and Â£. that American investments can only prop up the white minority gov-
~ ernment there for a little longer. . 

She also said the Soviet Union is no better than the United States, as it

What UCSD Students -Need . is na Cause" 
by Ber1L"ee 
Staff Writer 

Earlier this quarter Revelle College convened 
its first convocation in memorial to the ideas and 
visions of its founding fathers. One of those 
present was Dr. Roger Revelle , who offered in-
sights Into the basic philosophical and practical 
problems which confronted UCSD in its early 
formative stages and also detailed the early hopes 
of the college. 

The Triton Times once again goes to Revelle to 
get his views on a number of situations surroun-
dingUCSD. 

'IT: I understand that the purpose of the college 
cluster system and of the rigid curricul~ 
requirements is to help the student to develop his 
latent ability to learn. But are structure and 
curriculum enough in themselves? Many students 
are not excited about learning simply because 
they view education precisely in terms of a 
structured and constraining life. 

Revelle: I guess one of my fundamental beliefs 
is that people are happiest when they have a cause 

that they can lose themselves in, when they are 
involved in something bigger than they are. One of 
the happiest times of my life was when I was in-
volved in the building of this university, which is 
much bigger than any man. ~ 

One analogy to this is the building of a cathedral. 
I' The cathedral was built by {JUlny people, but 

nobody knows who they were. There were many 
people involved, not for their own glory, but for the 
greater glory of God. They were sustained by a 
vision of something greater than they were, 
something transcendent 

This is one of the main things we should try to 
teach our students; that we are best off when we 
are working for something greater than ourselves. 
Of course, we have to believe wholeheartedly in 
what we're doing. 

The main problem is to get students involved. In 
a sense, radical politics is an important element of 
the university because it is something that 
students can really lose themselves in. But 
students need to work to become experts in a 
particular field if they want to get their cause 
heard and understood by others.

Gene Holland, one of four students

"slick."

Bi e Shop not to Blame for Theft 

On Wednesday, JW1e 8, Tse-Ling

slanderous letter dealing with the 
UCSD Bike Shop. Several points 
are entirely in error. We would like 
to clear up these points. 

First, in reference to why we did

by letting Fong use the phone in 
contacting the proper authorities.

has never and will never be an 
employee of the UCSD Bike Shop. 

The Bike Shop has cooperated 
fully with the efforts of the police. 
The investigating detective, 
Murray Penhollow, does not seem 
to be pursuing this case with his 
usual fervor. 

As Personnel Manager, I have

Fong to clear up these points, but 
he has refused to return my calls or

Women Against Violence 
Against Women is an activist 
organization working to halt the 
epidemic use of images of physical 
and sexual violence against women 
in mass media. On May 19 the 
Women's Center sponsored a 
presentation by Julie London, an 
activist in WAVAW. London told 
the audience that the group has 
called for a boycott of Warner, 
Electra, and AUantic records, 
being among the prime movers of 
this kind of advertising. The 
boycott is called in coalition with 
California NOW. 

/WoTrlER r 9reRE-~o 

Some examples of sex violence 
used in advertising include: the 
album "Wild Angel" by Nelson 
Slater, which shows a woman 
gagged with a heavy chain; "Do 
You Want A Thing?" by Blood-
stone which features a gang rape 
scene; "Thriller" by Cold Blood, 
showing a woman lying on the 
ground after an assault, her 
clothing askew; and all of the Ohio 
Players albums. 

Racist Ad Must Go 
W A V A W recognizes that media 

violence perpetuates the myth 
that women are victims, naturally 
and happily masochistic. This 
advertising is being used at a time 
when rape is increasing and when 
a conservative estimate puts the 
number of battered women in the 
United States at one million. 

The Women's Center and 
Feminist Coalition urges students 
to visit a record store and check 
out the album covers. Then write to 
Ahmet Ertegun; Atlantic Records, 
75 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, 
NY 10020; and to Mo Ostin, Warner 
Bros. Records, 3300 Warner B1. , 
Burbank, CA 91505 - and explain 
why you are boycotting those 
albums which demonstrate sex 
violence. Let the record store 
manager know which albums you 
refuse to purchase. The record 
industry must begin to take social 
responsibility by eliminating their 
condoning violence against 
women. 

FEMINIST COALITION 
WOMEN'S CENTER 

We would like to bring to the 
attention of the community the 
advertisement put out by Auto 
Metric in the May 'n issue of the 
Triton Times and in several issues 
of the Reader. The advertisement 
portrays an ugly, stereotyped 
image of an Asian with buck teeth, 
a big nose, and a pigtail among 
other things. 

This image was born and filar-
tured by ignorance, suspiCion, and 
irrational hatred towards Asian 
Americans. In the year 1977, we 
are once again painfully reminded 
that these images of the past are 
still very much alive. We are 
greatly offended by this blatant 
attack on our dignity . 

I was told by a woman in the 
advertising department at Auto 
Metric that no offense was in-
tended by the ad; however, I was 
offended by the fact that she 
refused to discontinue the ad since 
this would mean a loss of money 
equivalent to the price of a few of 
their advertised "brake specials." 
I was also offended when she told

me that I was I "making a mountain

The reason why she cannot 
comprehend the insult dealt by the 
ad is her obvious ignorance of the 
Asian-American experience and of 
Asian-Americans as a people. A 
clear example of this Ignorance 
appears in the ad itself : a 
stereotyped Chinese man is used in 
conjunction with Datsun, a 
Japanese automobile manufac-
turer. 

Is this another example of the 
amoral nature of American 
business? We find this attack on 
our self-esteem in order to sell 
" brake specials" a disgrace. The 
Asian American Student Alliance 
therefore demands that Auto 
Metric iIrunediately discontinue 
printing this ad and make a public 
apology to the Asian-American 
community and that the Triton 
Times refuse to publish these ads if 
Auto Metric fails to comply.

I wish to extend my most sincere 
compliments to the people at 
CAPE. The current book, unlike 
last quarter's, is completely free of 
biased political cartoons. There 
are no political cartoons at all, for 
that matter. 

By thus stepping off its political 
soap box, CAPE has done us all a 
fa vor, for such an institution 
should never be in any way biased,

Teacben OD Strike 
In a glass case outside the Pacific Beach Junior High School principal's 

office are four wooden plaques from the Valley Forge Freedom Foun-
dation. The plaques, dating from 1969 to 1974, honor the school for helping 
to "bring a better understanding ofthe American way of life." Among the 
American rights ouWned on the plaques are the "rights to peaceably 
assemble" and the " rlgit to bargain with our employers and em-
ployees." 

Outside PBJH this week, a group of about 35 teachers have been 
exercising those American rights. Holding signs, they stroll quietly past 
the school, as part of a general teacher strike that has practically 
paralyzed the educational process at many area schools. 

About 80 percent of PBJH teachers are on strike, according to 
geography teacher Frank Meyers. This percentage, espec.ially for a 
traditionally conservative school like PBJH, stand<! quite well compared 
to the city-wide average which as of Tuesday night was about 15 percent. 

While teacher strikes have occurred in other major cities, this Is the 
first one in San Diego. It happened at least in part because of timing, and 
the need for bargaining power. The Board of Education doesn't want to 
negotiate a new contract until the beginning of the next fiscal year, Juiy 1. 
The San Diego Teachers Association-the local teacher bargaining unit-
wants to negotiate now, not in the summer when the teachers are gone. 

So the teachers are on strike. And the classrooms are being attended by 
non-striking teachers, substitutes, teacher assistants and conununity 
"volunteers". (The "volunteers," by the way, are being paid $50 a day-
$13 more than the usual substitute rate.) 

But the teachers are not just striking for more money, Meyers said 
Tuesday. 

"Sure money's important, but it's not the only thing, contrary to the 
impreSSion the media is giving," Meyers said. " What's at the heart of the 
matter is classroom size, and the amount of money going to the top heavy 
school administration at the Education Center downtown. 

Classroom size is probably the biggest sticking point in the 
negotiations. The administration provides statistics on average 
classroom size. It derives the figure by dividing the total students at a 
school by the number of teacher,s (including counselors, nurp and 
librarian) there. 

" But average class size doesn't make a difference to a kid in a class of 
40. Average class size is meaningless. What we want Is a mamnum class 
size. But the administration won't even bargain on the point," Meyers 
said. 

While the teachers picket outside, children in the building next to them 
look out the windows, tossing paper airplanes and shouting. "Having a 
good education'!" one teacher calls out. 

Apparently they aren't. According to the teachers, and several school 
kids, the situation in the classrooms is verging on chaos. 

"Let me put it this way," one striking teacher said. "Some rl the 
substltutes who were here yesterday aren't here today." 

While some of the c~sses must haveÂ·been attended by capable people, a 
lot of them are attended only by a body, a person who Is there only 
because the law requires someone to be there. They are babY-flitters, at 
$5O-day, instead of 75 cents-an-hour. 

When asked for comment on these developments, PBJH principal 
Robert Menke refused to talk and referred a reporter to the San Diego 
Unified School District's Public Infonnatlon Office. PBJH ad-
ministrators wouldn't even release student attendance figures. 

But one teacher knew the attendance figures for Monday. She said the 
PBJH vice-principal told her 211 percent of the students were absent 
Monday morning. Forty percent were gone by Monday afternoon. 

So school board claims that the schools will remain open during the 
strike are sort of true. 

One thing that has excited PBJH teachers is the sense rl solidarity they 
have found among themselves. "The most amazing thing is that so many 
teachers are here," Meyers said. " I mean, you can't usually get teachen 
to agree on anything." As they picketed, one teacher suggested sending 
school superintendant Tom Goodman "a bottle of booze" to thank him for 
unifying them.

Israel is More Progressive than any Arab State 
Arab's claims of being anti-Zionist, and not anti-semitic 

are ludicrous, and contradict historical realities. ' 
When the Young Socialist Alliance takes this stance and 

at the same time proclaims freedom, national d~terÂ­
mination and social justice, we could naively be confused. 
Perhaps though, they are the ones confused. 

It is only of late, that Arab leaders have recognized that 
anti-Semitism, expressed as such, is not favorably received 
by the west. So, the tone has changed, the words have 
changed ... but not the meaning. 

How can tllli: not be, when in Egypt alone, during World 
War II, Nasser, Sadat, Prime MiiUster Ali Maher Pasha 
Chief of Staff Aziz el Misri, and King Farouk were all prO: 
Nazis? In Syria during that time, the entire political 
spectrum was aligned with the Axis powers. Since then 
these countries have offered asylum to many infamo~ 
Nazis, including Goebbel's aide, Johann Van Leers Eic~ 
man's coadjutor, Alois Brunner and the former ssGeneral 
Alois Moser, who was integrated into the Egyptian Secret 
Service as coordinator of Israel activities. 

Arab leaders continue to use "Zionism" and "world 
Jewry" interchangeably, if not to the west, then at least to 
their own people. A 1967 UNESCO investigation found 80 out 
of 108 Arab schoolbooks used in Gaza and the West Bank to 
be unsuitable for use because of their anti-Jewish and 
genocidal expoundings. As one example, in The Culture of 
Islam, a book intended for third year high school students, 
on page ISO, we find, "The Jews are wicked criminals who 
came to Palestine." In another book, a Jordanian text, 
Modern World HistorY, the same sentiments appear, "The 
Jews in Europe were persecuted and despised because of 
their corruption, meanness and treacherY." 

[n Syria today, Jews must carry identity cards. They 
caMot drive or have a telephone. They are forbidden to 
leave, cannot travel freely and cannot occupy public 
positions. 

[n Israel, in 1975, there were four Arabs who were in 
Parliament. Of these, one was the Deputy Minister of 
Communications-, and the other was the Deputy Speaker of 
Parliament (the Knesset) . 

Article 22, the oft quoted passage from the (still un-
changed) 1968 " Palestinian National Covenant" reads: 

"Zionism is a political movement organically related to 
world imperialism and hostile to all movements of 
liberation and progress in the world. It is a racist and 
fanatical movement is its formation; aggressive, ex-
pansionist and colonialist in its aims; and fascist and nazi in 
its means. Israel if the tool of the Zionist movement and a 
human and geographical base for world imperialism ... " 

In seventeen of the Arab League states, including Egypt, 
Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Libya, there is no free press. In 
lsrael, there is. As of 1974, there was a 12% illiteracy rate in 
Israel, as compared to 65% in Egypt, 62% in Jordan, 60% in 
Svria and 73% in Libya. Israel is a democratic state, with 
goverrunents elected by popular vote, as evidenced by the 
recent upset victory of the Likud Party. The Arab states, 
with the exception of Lebanon, have military or one-party 
dictatorships. In Israel, religious freedom is mandated with 

a separation of church and state, while at least 12 Arab 
states have constitutions which proclaim that Islam is to be 
the state religion. Finally, is the Young Socialist Alliance 
aware of the dichotomy between the status of women in 
Israel and the ~tatus of women elsewhere in the mid-east? 
We must ask then, that in light of Article 22, which contries 
are more liberated? More progressive? 

The Arab nations maintain that they are not hostile to 
Jewish people, nor Judaism, only Zionism. In November of 
1975, the New York Times carried a full page ad: 

"We reject the claim of Zionism to be co-extensive with 
the Jewish people. And therefore, we reject the claim of 
Zionism that to be anti-Zionist is to be anti-Jewish and anti-

_ Semitic." 

Uniike the young Socialists, we are not naively fooled. We 
look behind these words and see an Arab boycott which 
discriminates against not only businesses which deal with 
Israel, but one that also discriminates against businesses 
and finns that have Jews on their board of directors as 
owners and executives. Is it that all these companies are 
Zionist? And how does one account for the manifold 
maltreatment of Jews in countries such as Ubya, Iraq and 
Syria-were these persecuted individuals all Zionists? If so, 
how did their governments know? In actuality, it is an 
exercise in sophistry to distinguish between a practicing 
Jew and a Zionist. A year before his death, Martin Luther 
King said, "When people criticize Zionists, they mean 
Jews." 

So, who really is more racist? Which societies are closer 
to the full emancipation of their peoples, all their peoples ? 
As far as utopian ideals go, which countries in the middle 
east are striving fastest, in real terms (such as hospital 
building, education, farming improvements, and birth 
control programs) to achieve them'! Rhetoric is cheap, 
peace talk florid, but action, founded in basic humanitarian 
commitments, unfortunately rare. 

Yes, Young Socialists, you let your utopian ideals get 
compromised by adopting euphemisms that stand for 

v~olence and hatred against Jews ever since Jews have 
been around. 

In 1970, the leader of the Israel Communist party, Moshe 
Sneh, said, " the identification of Zionism with imperialism 
and with .. . racism and Nazism are insults to every Jew as 
a Jew." 

Before I conclude, one last thing. Please don't use the 
" Law of Return", which, for any eligible Jew, guarantees 
autdmatic citizenship in the state of Israel, as an example 
of Israeli racism. To do so, you underscore your non-
comprehension of Jewish tragedy throughout the ages. 

Faced with persecution and death, Jews in all times have 
been denied entry into countries which could have given 
them relief and tefuge. Even America, in her short history, 
has turned away shiploads of Jewish people at her shores, 
only to have insured them oftheir fiery deaths in Dachau or 
Treblinka. This is the reason for the Law of Return-so that 
there will always be at least one place that a Jew can go to 
where he will nto be turned away. Non-Jews can certainly 
become citizens of Israel, but Israel does not afford them 
special passage. They must go through regular im-
migration channels. 

The state of Israel was created while the ovens at Ausc~ 
witz were still warm. For her to deny Jews the privilege of 
return would be to act in contradiction to the event that 
precipitated the creation of Israel, namely the holocaust. 
Israel cannot be expected to do what no country in ali time, 
and all history has ever done-that is, to go against one's self 
interest, one's raison d'etre. . 

And so, Young Socialists, by your political stance, you 
, find yourself sharing the same idealogies of some of the 

worst Jew-haters in history. Your demands for a 
" democratic secular state in Palestine" square well with 
the modified Arab parlances heard frequently today. We 
are quite sure what the Arabs mean by this, however. Back 
in 1970, in Al Anwar, the Lebanese daily paper, a discussion 
about the meaning of this phrase was carried in its pages. 
This quote, spoken by a representative of the PLO, cannot 
be misinterpreted : 

" If the slogan of a Democratic state is meant only to 
answer the claim that we wish to throw the Jews to the sea, 
then this is a successful slogan and a useful political and 
propaganda act. " Other statements, made by various Ara b 
groups today are likely to be less frank. Their meanings, 
however, sadly remain the same. 

Your position is ironic, for one only has to but count the 
numerous Jews who have been instrumental in socialist 
movements throughout the world. Inside the Third Reich, it 
was Jews and communists alike who were the targets of 
Germany 's vicious and plunderous wrath. 

Young Socialists, you say that there are many Jews in 
your midsts. This is undoubtedly true, but then, there are 
many socialists who do not espouse your particular brand of 
Socialism either. In short, not all socialists are " Young 
SoCialists, " and not all socialists are "anti-Zionists". To 
me, your dogma and disregard for historical reality on this 
issue degrades the socialistic-utopian ideals that you may 
have once had. 

HARLAN SIMON 

YSA Condemns Zionism, not Judism 
In the May 9 Triton Times, there was an article 

with the erroneous title "YSA Uses Israel as 
'Scapegoat"'. Scratch " erroneous"; insert " patently 
untrue". But it seems some supporters of Israel have 
found their own scapegoat-the Young Socialist 
Alliance. The subject of the Zionist nation carries 
such an emotional impact, that honest criticism of it 
seems to elicit hysterical denunciations. Wild and 
irrational. allegations have been thrown around 
loosely and blindly at us, especially by Ralph 
Grunewald,Joel Balbien, and David Pollock. 

cupied (I.e. conquered) territories? The answer is 
NO! 

Although only a minority of the refugees are still 
living in the UN-run refugee camps (644,000 out of 3.2 
million Palestinians), it has been the terrible burden 
of their plight especially with their rapidly increasing 
population) that has been the basis for much of the 
conflict between Israel and the Arab nations. Neither 
the UN nor the Arabs have had the resources to 
rapidly aid the Palestinian masses. And the Israelis 
have traditionally closed their eyes to the problem. 
An infamous statement of Golda Meier'S is 
" Palestinians'! What Palestinians? They don't 
exist!" This is consistent with the theoretical and 
chauvinistic goal of their Zionist nation. And that 
nation has in turn, been a political foothold for the 
forces of US imperialism. 

Grunewald Answers YSA; 
Calls for Open Debate 

The latter two a\lthored an article in the June 6 
Triton Times. It is obvious they know absolutely 
nothing about our organization, and we resent their 
blatant lies. We are not "anonymous". We sign our 
name to our letters because the ideas written 
represent a collective effort and the views of the 
group. We spread many of our other ideas in the 
recent AS elections where we ran a slate of three 
candidates : Anthony Gonzales, Dwayne Stillwell, and 
Pauline Breeden. We are not "totalitarian in intent". 
We are firm believers in hearing all points of view 
and in democratic discussion and debate. These are 
activities we are constantly involved in. We are not 
into " sloganism". We have ' articulate positions and 
have a great deal of literature on everY position we 
take . We set up a literature table three times a week 
in Muir plaza. Many people know us . Our numbers 
are not "dwindling". As a national organization, our 
membership is growing, and the same is true with our 
city chapter. 

But the biggest lie is that we are " blatantly anti-
semitic". Our position on Israel is that we advocate 
the creation of a democratic nonsectarian Palestine, 
where there are democratic liberties for all groups; 
Jewish, Christian, and Moslem. We support the right 
of world Jewry to live anywhere in the world they 
want to. We emphasize that we condemn Zionism and 
not Judaism. We have many Jewish members, and 
Leon Trotsky, the original leader of our movement, 
was a Jew. 
~ Contemporary Zionism is not simply the movement 
for a J ewish homeland. That alone is a commendable 
ideal. The key question is : Do the Israelis have the 
right to displace nearly an entire nation of people, 
keep them out by force, expropriate their property 
and land, and do some of the same things in the DC-

Concerning the "humane relationship" between the 
Palestinians and Israelis that Iric Fishbein spoke of, 
we hope he will consider a few " whys" in return: 

Why has " progressive" Israel bombarded refugee 
camps with napalm at various times in the past? 

Why do 13,000 Palestinian prisoners (ranging in 
age from 12 to 80) languish in Israeli jails, to be 
subject to the most atrocious forms of torture and 
habitually denied access to the Red Cross? 

Why are certain Palestinians allowed to tour and 
work in their own homeland but not to come there to 
live? 

Why do Israeli police shoot down rioting Arabs in 
the West Bank? And why are those "contented" folks 
rioting in the first place '! 

The list could go on and on ... 
Finally, we should spell out our position on the Arab 

governments. We agree that they are, as a whole, 
repressive and undemocratic. We do not support 
them, and we only conditionally support the PLO 
(nationalism; but not the terrorism) . The in-
ternational Trotskyist movement of which we are a 
part, calls for socialist democracy in the Arab 
nations ; as we do for all the countri~s of the world. 
We do not politically agree with the Arab regimes. 
But. we also do not see them as the main cause of the 
Middl East conflict. We feel the cause is the U3 
upported ultranationalism of Israel. 

YOUNG OCIALI T ALLIAN E 

In 100 words or less, the 
Triton Times has allowed me to 
respond to the YSA letter of 
June 8, which accused me of 
being " chauvinistic" and 
"obtuse." Their letter was a 
response to mine, which ap-
peared on June 3, in what has 
developed into a debate on these 
pages, pitting the YSA against 
supporters of Israel. Both of the 
opposing positions have been 

clearly sta'ted and restated (see 
today's Triton Times) ( invite 
the YSA to an open debate next 
year to discuss these issues 
face-to-face . Maybe then they 
will understand their hypocrisy 
and double-standardism. Until 
then, I would hope all students 
would learn about the issues for 
themselves.

KKK'S Actions and Conduct 
Cannot be Condoned 

Among the many errors put 
forward by Richard Stevens in his 
recent letter is his total misun-
derstanding of the First Amend-
ment to the US Constitution. Stated 
very briefly and very simply (so as 
to comport with Stevens' limited 
intellectual development), the 
protection afforded by the First 
Amendm ot extends to speech an:! 
symbolic action, not to acts of 
violence. 

With reference to the existenc 
of the Ku Klux Klan at Camp 
Pendl ton, de fens attorneys for 
the Camp Pendleton 14 (with whom 
I assume tevens is acquainted , 

have documented proof that the 
members of the Pendleton Klan, 
both jointly and individually, have 
en aged in a pattern of systematic 
vioience - replete with attempted 
shootings and gang muggings -
against black servicemen on base 

sinc'~ last summer. The elemen-
tary principles of the First 
t\J 1It:IIUIII m CitlUlV1. bt! ureugt:d up 
by anyone, including a highly 
privileged and vpry confused 
college tudent like Richard 
tevens, to condon such conduct.

But the teacbers seem deter-

struggling because they're making 
some good points. Administrators 
should not be paid more than 
teachers; the practice causes 
many good teachers to move out of 
the classroom where they are 
desperately needed. The San Diego 
school district does have too many 
administrators, who operate in 
isolation, making decisions af-
fecting students they never see. 
Classroom size is directly 
proportional to t eaching e f-

expect a teacher to be effective

city Council Approves 
L J Speciality Center 

by CiDdhi Hill 
Staff Writer 

The San Diego City Council Wednesday approved the La JoUa Specialty 
Center, a mu1ti-unit shopping complex, slated for construction southeast 
of UCSD off La JoUa Village Ave. 

The Council was meeting to hear an appeal by La JoUa merchant, Fred 
Scott, Jr. against a recent decision by the Planning Commission to ap-
prove the May Co,/Bren Corp. project. 

The shopping center was approved by the Planning Commission on 
March 15, overriding a Planning Department's recommendation to deny 
the permit because tbe center does not conform with the University 
Corrununity Plan. 

Councilman Leon Williams and Jess Haro voted against denial of the 
appeal. 

Testimony was heard from Scott and his attorney, a constituency 
representing the May-Bren partnership, the Planning Dept., individuals 
from the University and La JoUa community areas, the chainnan of the 
University Planning Group, and various members of the UCSD com-
munity, including the office of the Chancellor, the faculty , the ASUCSD 
and the Graduate Student Council, 

Planning Department official 
Ken Kline, reiterated the depart-
ment's previous recommendation 
that the shopping center be denied, 
and in addition suggested the re-
zoning of a northerly portion of the 
May IBren property to R-3, a 
residential zoning. Such a re-
zoning would prevent commercial 
development of the property. 

Bruce Henderson. Scott's at-
torney, said, "It is our contention 
that the specialty center is regional 
because it is designed to draw over 
80 percent of its market from 
outside the local area." 

" Therefore," Henderson said, 
" the question here is the viability 
of the University Community plan, 
which clearly states that a regional 
shopping center is not desireable 
for the area." 

The presentation by the 
representatives of the Specialty 
Center was headed by the San 
Diego-based attorney Ferdinand 
Fletcher. 

The design of the center was 
emphaSized during a slide 
presentation, during which su~ 
porters of the center said, that 
because of the "heavy emphasis on 
use of natural materials and 
landscaping" and because it "will 
not have the sense of anchored 
ends" as in other shopping centers, 
the project is "not in a regional 
category as defined by the city of 
San Diego. " 

Dr. Walter Munk, representing 
campus faculty, Peter Tiersma of 
the Graduate Student Council and 
President Jeff Leifer, speaking for 
the ASUCSD, all indicated a 
unanimous opposition to the 
project due to its non-confonnity 
with the Community plan, its

Students Act 
To Form Class 
On Sexuality 

by John Compton 
StaHWrlter 

The lack of a human sexuality 
course has prompted some student 
action to see that such a class is 
instituted. 

A sheet has been placed in the 
Department of Physical Education 
with the intent of soliciting names 
from students to show that there 
"is support" for such a course. 

Howard Hunt , acting Vice-
chancellor and Dean of Student 
Mfairs, stated that he feels that the 
course is " very needed and 
necessa ry . " 

"Evidence seems to show that 
one of the greatest problems in 
society today relates to sex, II said 
Hunt. He posed a hypothetical 
question, asking : " Why enter a 
relationship without the knowledge 
to make it a healthy relationship, 
complete with an understanding of 
what's going on?" 

To meet the requirements of the 
Committee on Educational 
Program, the course must 
originate from an academic 
department, and presently there's 
a problem in finding a department 
willing to support the course. Hunt 
noted that other colleges have the 
same such course in a variety of 
different departments, including 
biology, sociology, anthropology 
and physical education. 

Continued from Page 1 
We knew we couldn't get the administration to accept $348 (the 

minimum reg fee level for next year) and we didn't want $372 (the 
maximwn level). sO we compromised on $360," Harris said. . 

Among the other issues which caused controversy for the conuruttee 
were the cost of gynecological services at the Studen.t Health Ce~ter and 
continued funding for intercoUegiate and recreational athletics, the 
campus Day Care Center and the Crafts Center. 

Alternate Plans 
"There is only a minimal chance of fun~~,free gy.necol,ogi~~l servi~es 

directly through registration fee montes, HarrIS sa1d: But R1Ck 
Whitehill (the Associate Vice-chancellor of Student Affalrs) 1S working ~n 
several alternative plans to allow free pap smears and pelV1C 
examinations. " 

Among the methods being examined are using medical ~tudents to giye 
free examinations as part of their education and allowmg C?f!UDuruty 
health clinics to use campus facilities in exchange for glvrng free 
examinations to women students, Harris said. 

In addition, intercollegiate and recreational athletics were funded on a 
permanent basis, while the Day Care Center an~ Crafts Center we~e 
placed on a "one-time only" funding basis, Wh1Ch means they will 
probably lose their reg fee funding after next year. . ' 

As for next year, Harris linked the f~rthe~ level of regIStratIOn fees to 
several factors, including the rate of mnation and enrollment, and the 
salary raises the state legislature gives to UC employees. " 

(While the Legislature sets pay rates for UC employees, the uOlvers1ty 
has to pay the actual salaries. The bulk of reg fee dollars goes to pay 
employee salaries.) 

Harris also talked about her personal plans for next year. She plans to 
try increasing communication between the committee and the student 
body through a number of methods, including open forums every quarter 
and regular open lunches where students can talk to commlttet: me~Â­
bers, and by sending out press releases telling what the corruruttee IS 
doing. 

ADOtherGoll 
Another of her personal goals is completion of a student services su:-

vey, to measure student feelings on services funded br the reg fee . Ha,rrlS 
said the committee would use the survey when dec1ding what servICes 
should continue to receive reg fee funding.

Lyrics Come to a Dead End 

FLOWER 
the people place to be 

by Paul Watry 
_ Sta" Writer 

As a group, the Moody Blues 
represented what was perhaps the 
most particular of all rock bands. 
Each album, meticulously 
~roduced, reflected the merging of 
five separate individuals; of-
tentimes fusing rock with sym-
phonic sound. 

It is impossible, then, to sever 
fonner member John Lodge from 
his earlier connections as a 
member of the band. He has 
certainly picked up a lot-
especially from his partner Justin 
Hayward-in the art of producing 
and selling a successful album. 
Thus. it sh~d ~_s~~t

his 'first solo album: Natural 
Avenue, should have echoes of 
earlier Moody Blues reverberating 
in its grooves. It is even less sur-
prising when it is learned that Tony 
Clarke, producer of the Moody 
Blues, produced this album also. 

The result, however glamorous, 
is not fruitful. 

The selections on this album lack 
the creative spark and zest that 
characterized the Moody Blues. 
Compared to the melancholy in-
trospection of Lodge's "Isn't Life 
Strange" or the brilliance of "Send 
Me No Wine," most songs here, by 
contrast, seem insipid. 

Particularly mediocre are the 
songs "Carry Me," which is 
completely over-orchestrated and 
"Natural Avenue," which sounds 
like a weak parody of Justin 
Hayward's "Ride My Sea-8aw." 

Though very weak, this album Is 
an important one. It represents a 
breaking away of Lodge from the 
rest of the Moody Blues. Though 
not entirely evident by the Roger 
Dean cover, Natural AveDue 
avoids as much as possible the 
cosmic cliche's that characterized 
the Moody Blues. No longer does 
Lodge sing about "This Garden 
Universe." Instead, he has opted 
for love lyrics. 

The result is not too promising. 
But perhaps Lodge will get better 
at it. Lyrics from the album are 
amazingly bad. Lines like 

Living on air you take 
From the Earth for free 
Money you make to pay 
For all this liberty 

just don't seem to make it 
nowadays. Neither does John 
Lodge . He is like a George 
Harrison .. .lost without his part-
ners.

UCSD Poets 
Come OUt of 
Woodwork 

A glimpse at the Spring '77 issue 
of 'Roadwork' proves that UC San 
Diego houses a healthy group of 
poets and writers, comprised of 
both faculty members and 
students. 'Roadwork, ' the campus 
literary journal was generated this 
~ear out . of Helicon, the poetry 
Journal, m an attempt to give 
student writing a wider audience 
than it has had here in past years 
according to editor Larry Hart: 
wick. 

The Spring issue comes as a 
result of the large nwnber of 
writers who submitted pieces for 
the winter issue. This quarter's 
issue has an expanded format with 
80 instead of the usual 30 pages. 
The intent of the Spring issue is to 
bring in a greater cultural 
diversity in the writing than was 
present in past issues, Hartwick 
said. The cultural diversity that 
Hartwick speaks of is evident in 
the selections by faculty members. 
Sherley Williams, professor of 
literature, contributed several 
poems which incorporate black 
dialect. The poetry of Wai-Lim 
Yip. also a literature professor, 
reflect the Chinese technique of the 
poem as a montage of juxtaposed 
lm8ges. 

. The, balance of the writing in the 
ISSue IS by students, and much of it 
seems to deal with the individual's 
place in society. " In general " 
Hartwick said, " the writers take' a 
less academic approach to the 
problem of the individual con-
fronting society than in the last 
issue. In the last issue, the writers 
seemed to be more concerned with 
the artistic value of language. I 
think in this issue, that the writers 
have broken free from these 

_ ...... ..,.-

Larry Hart wick 
constraints ... 

The poetry and prose in the issue 
are complemented by graphics by 
artists from the UCSD and La Jolla 
communities. The most notable of 
these is Francoise Gilot, artist and 
former wife of Picasso, who

contributed several pen and mk 
drawings for the issue. 'Roadwork' 
will go on sale in the bookstore on 
June 14. It a worthwhile purchase 
for anyone who is interested in the 
state of writing at UCSD.

failure to serve University needs 
and the lack of student 
representation in any previous 
negotiations. 

R.H. Hamstra, chairman of the 
University Planning Group, read a 
previously-unknown letter written 
by " a group of faculty members 
calling themselves a plarming 
group" to the developers agreeing 
that commercial construction on 
the La Jolla Village site would not 
exceed 350,000 square feet and 
residential construction would 
equal 490,000 square feet, with a 
minimum of 147,000 square feet. 

The specialty center is planned 
to be 350,000 square feet. 

Judith Monk, an active member 
in the University PlaMing Group, 
said after the council meeting, "It 
was completely out of order for 
Hamstra to make such a statement 
that the letter should be binding for 
the good of the University plan."

UCSD's Joe Greenstein 
Makes Canadian Nationals 

by JOIIIIalperIa 
Spona FAUt.r 

The Place: Montreal, Canada 
The Time: 2:15 am Eastern 
Standard Time 
The Date: May 71977 

Joe Greenstein, UOiD studera, 
leaves Montreal's famous 
Limelight bar and promptly finds 

but the talented junior had 
already impressed head coach 
~ Eltas enough to be named 
one of the final 10 players on the 
squad. 

Greenstein was picked from a 
contingent of 47 players, the top 
Jewish ballplayers in the 
country. In fact, Greenstein, who 

UCSD basketball player Joe Greenstein 

out why Quebec drivers are the 
worst in the continent. 

Greenstein's rental car is 
broadsided by a vehicle that has 
just run a red light. In the 
process, he receives torn 
shoulder ligaments; an injury 
that almost costs Â· him the es-
perienceofa lifetime. 

Just hours earlier, he had 
qualified for the Canadian 
National Maccabian team which 
will compete in Israel this 
swnmer. The injury caused him 
to miss tbe second day of tryouts, 

grew up in Toronto and played his 
high school ball for Grant high 
school in North Hollywood, 
almost played for the Americans. 

In a west coast tryout held a 
week earlier at UCLA, Green-
stein, along with Joel Kramer of 
San Diego State, Lewis Cohen of 
Cal State San Luis Obispo, and 
two others were named to go to 
New York for the final cuts of the 
American squad. 

However, when Greenstein 
learned that Gary Rosenberger 
(starting guard for national 

champion . Marquette) , all ACC 
guard Brad Davis of Maryland 
and all CCAA guard Lewis Cohen 
would be his chief competition for 
starting position. He opted to 
forgo his trip to New York in 
favor of a better chance of 
starting for the Canadians. 

High School Standout 
Joe Greenstein was born in 

Toronto, Canada but moved west 
to Los Angeles with his parents in 
1962. He prepped at US Grant 
high school, where as a senior 
(can you believe this) played 
center on the varsity squad. 
Grant won the league tiUe that 
year, but ran up against Cren-
shaw High in the first round and 
was eliminated. Crenshaw is the 
home of Marques Johnson, 
Sudden Sam Smith, and Gregory 
Johns to name a (ew. 

In his three years at UaiD, two 
with the varsity and one with the 
junior varsity, Greenstein came 
to be known as "Jumping Joe" 
because of his amazing leaping 
ability. It was this facet of his 
game which allowed him to play 
center in hi~ school, despite his 
6'2" height. 

Always a terrific rebounder 
and an aggressive defender, 
Greenstein can usually be found 
in the middle o( the acuon. In one 
game this past season, he almost 
caused a mass riot as be took an 
ill aimed sWing at a Southern 
caillornia College player. Both 
benches emptied, but no major 
altercation developed. 

It was this aggressive style of 
play which ultimately sold 
Canadian head coach Sam Eltas 
and impressed the Americans. 

Team Leaves in July 
Greenstein will arrive in 

Montreal on June 26 and will go 
through two weeks of practice 
before taking off to Israel. His 
shoulder is fine now but his 
knees, which have always been 
questionable, may only last 
through the summer. That would 
be too bad, UOiD basketball 
could sure use Joe Greenstein.

Patton is Pro Prospect 
by Don Armstrong 

Staff Writer 
This man may never be a 

baseball legend. Homerun hitters 
become legends. He simply wants 
to make it to the major leagues and 
hit for a high average. However, 
this should be good enough to put 
Gary Patton, UCSD's senior, first 
baseman/catcher, in the Triton 
Hall of Fame. 

His goal may seem lofty, yet 
Patton has surprisingly good 
credentials. He also has a definite 
con(idence and maturity which 
seems to spell success. Patton 
gives much of the credit for his self 
assurance to UCSD confidence 
imtructor Bob Moss. Yet, "he 
has," as he puts it, "always had 
pro aspirations." 

Patton was a two time All-City 
selection at Castlemont High in 
Oakland. His credentials were 
good enough to make the Kansas 
City Royals want to draft him out 
of high school and send him to the 
Arizona Instructional League. 
However, an uncooperative high 
school coach discouraged the 
Kansas City scouts. So, Patton 
enrolled at UCSD. He chose UCSD 
in order to "get a good education 
and prepare for the other parts of 
life. " 

This past s ummer, Patton 
played on the highly competitive 
Alaskan Collegiate League, a 
league which has helped develop 
many present major league ball 
players. When given a chance to 
play, Patton perfonned well, but 
the chances wer.e few. He at-
tributes this to the Alaskan League 

coach's low regard (or UCSD's 
level of competition. Still, Patton 
does not regret having attended 
UCSD. He agrees with the 
philosophy that college sports 
should be intended for learning and 
enjoyment. Yet, he tells of having 
to push and inspire himself 
because many of his teammates 
were just out to have fun . Gary 
Patton takes baseball very 
seriously. 

Professional baseball's draft fA 
free agents will take place in early 
June. Having batted over .350 the 
past two seasons, Patton is COIr , 
fident about being drafted. A 
muscular 6 feet, 195 pounds, he 
looks the part of a major leaguer. 

In spite of all this, an intangible 
is probably Patton's most notable 
characteristic. He is known (or his 
strong character. He also has 
a very mature attitude, a definite 
wisdom about life. In spite of his. 
athletic accomplishments, Patton 
says be tries not to "dwell on past 
successes." Instead, he " looks to 
the future. " With the bat, glove, 
and mind of Gary Patton, you have 
to suspect that that future will be 
bright. 

Editors Note: Patton was not 
selected in the primary phase of 
the pro draft, (LA Times June 8) 
He can now opt to be a free agent or 
continue his baseball training in a 
semipro league.

C.Uaed inlll 

n: It appean tha 
for knowledge is a 
experience of self d 
should one give u.> immediate 
gratification in exchange for an 
asceticismofleaminr,? 

Revelle: 1bat is why losing 
oneself is so importarlt. Learning is 
a proces of patient self-preparation 
and it also requires a sense of 
sublime self-eonfidence. 

students shouldn't worry about 
failure . Faculty members make 
mistakes as well. Ninety percent of 
research consists of mistakes. 
Education will not teach a person 
how not to make mistakes, this 
must be learned. Students should 

not worry abo&j not seeing quick 
results from their work. Aa Iong_ 
they feel they are contrildlng to 
something greater than them-
selves, it makes everything 
alright. The people who built the 
cathedrals never worried about 
self-aggrandizement, for they were 
all working tog~r OIl a creative 
effort. Learning should be that way 
also. 

Commitment of LearnIDg 
'IT; In requiring students to 

learn different disciplines in depth, 
are you not asking a lot of an In-
dividual in terms of patience and 
self-sacrifice? 

Revelle: It does take a lot of. 
commitment, both to the ideals of 
learning and to the university. A 

triton time8 
great many people, however, don't 
care mucb about learning. Tbia 
puzzles me and diatreues me, and 
I don't quite understand why it is 
so. 

But it is so, and the university 
has a responsibility to these people 
as well. It is essentially a 
responsibility for training. Many 
people are interested in immediate 
action and their drives are power, 
or acquisition of wealth in con-
tentment in living, or sometimes 
just survival. 

Many students just want to get 
out of the university, get a job and 
start the business of " real life" as 
they say. I've never understood 
that, because I thought the 
university was "real life. "

Vice 

ittee Formed for 
hancellor Search 

A conunittee comprised of administrators, faculty, students and staff 
will meet this summer to make reconunendations to ~cellor ~cElr~y 
on the person tu fill the Vice-chancellor of Student Affall'S POSition this 

~ Good-The conunittee to be chaired by chemistry professor Murray 
man, will probably not start the actual interview process ~ select a 
successor for George Murphy until July, McElroy, who picked the 
committee, said Wednesday. . - . 

The delay is caused by affirmative action reg~tions that requlI'e 
posting of the job opening for one month, McElroy said. . 

When Murphy, who held the vice-chancellor and d~n of stude~t affa.ll'S 
post since 1968, resigned in April, McElroy promised a natlo~-wl(le 
search for a replacement. Physical Education department chairman 
Howard HWlt will hold the Interim position until September. 

The committee's student members are ASUCSD pre~ident Jeff Leife~, 
advisory committee on Student Fee Programs co-ch8lI' Marsha Hams 
and affirmative action committee member Donna Armstrong. 

Third College Provost Joseph Watson and Fourth College Provost Lea 
Rudee will represent the campus' provosts. .. 

Two faculty members were selected b~ McElroy, fr~m a list of SIX 
presented by the Academic Senate's Comnuttee on Committees. They are 
Goodman and Paul Libby, an AMES professor. . 

Fonner PE chairman Ted Forbes, campus budget office Bob Oakes, 
Affinnative Action Committee chairman Nick Atma, Student H.ealth 
Services director Robert Allen and Joyce Hittenberger, of the Office of 
Graduate Studies and Research, are also on the committee. 

Rally ... Continued from Page 1 
The letter sent by UC President 

Saxon to 37 corporations active in 
South Africa (Triton Times, June 
6) demonstrated that the Board of 
Regents are concerned only with 
the safety of its South African 
investments. 

"The Regents' questions In the 
letter completely sidestepped the 
issues we (the students) are 
concerned with. The Regents are 
only concerned with keeping ~e 
system intact. We want to gIVe 
South African back to the blacks," 
Holland said. 

The students planned an all-night 
vigil for last night, with a can-
dlelight march through the 
campus. They planned to end the 
vigil at dawn at the Chancellor'S 
home.

Under-the-Table Payoffs to Student Athlet~ Told 
Continued from Page 1 

school senior supposed to know 
that what he is being offered is 
illegal, and that it might be a good 
idea to get the offer in writing?" 

Different Ways of Pay..()ffs 
For those who finally get the pay-

offs, a source said, they see it in 
many fonns. Jobs, for instance, 
that have been arranged to pay $10 
per hour for playground super-
vision, the use of a car, new 
clothing and women are often used 
inducements. "The top two or 
three basketball players for major 
schools receive these things from 
the school, the alumni or a spo~ 
sor." 

Sources said that the top college 
athletes are also given extra ad-
vantages in many of the nation's 
classrooms, beginning with extra 
tutoring and sometimes going as 
far as hiring someone to take the 
athletes' tests. One athlete is said 
to have been enrolled at a junior 
college where he accumulated 
about eight WlIts, and he later 
admitted to friends that he never 
even knew the location of the 
school. "Professors usually know 
what's going on," a source said. 

Though the "Wlder the table" 
pay-offs have been. mainlr l~ted 
to men in the past, It was indicated 
that the occurances with women 
are growing, particularly on the 
east and west coasts in basketball. 

Few perfonners are willing to 
talk about the illegal inducements, 
and when they do, they often deny 
them. Ed RaUeff, now a guard for 
the Houston Rockets and fonnerly 
a star at Long Beach State, has 
said, " I played .. .f~r three years 
and made All-American two years. 
1 know I didn't receive anything 
and 1 didn't ask for anything. Now 
if an All-American didn't receive 
anything, who else are they gonna 
give itto?" 

Who paid for DWight Stones ' shirt? 

"Subsidies" By Different Means 
Regarding the college and club 

athletes who are paid by promoters 
to attend meets, one source said, 
"Someone has to subsidize the 
people who are supposed to be 
amateurs. The Arnateur Athletic 
Union (AAU) has to tum its head, 

or it will find that no one wants to, 
or can afford to be In things like the 
Olympics. " 

These pay-offs also take varied 
fonns, from airline tickets that can 
be cashed, to a new pair of shoes 
"that fit well in the toe. The kid 
looks in the shoe and finds a couple 

hundred dollars ." 
A source pointed to Americans 

Stones ("How do you think he 
bought a new condo and a 
Porsche?"), and Al Fuerback, 
French hurdler Guy Drut and New 
Zealand miler Walker as some of 
the richest from the promoter's 
practices. 

Recent NCAA and AAU crack-
downs on the illegal activities have 
"only a random effect," one source 
said. " The pay-offs are on the rise 
in many places, especially in the 
major schools where sports is a 
way oflife. 

"Some schools are now being 
priced out of the bidding war." 

Vandals Enter UJS 
Office, Deface Posters 

Vandals have broken in to the office of the Union of Jewish Students 
for the second time this year, and defaced posters with paint, ac-
cording to UJS respresentaUve Iric Fishbein. 

"We have no idea who is doing this," Fishbein said. "We haven't 
been approached personally by them-they apparently don't want to 
talk with us. 

" It 's reminiscent of the Nazi Gennany years." 
The defacing occurred early this week, according to. Fishbein. There 

was no indication yesterday of action by the UCSD police.

Students Return from New Hilnpshire 
The Jailed are Back :"We're United" 

by Laura Rlehter 
Staff Writer 

Randy Erickson and Brian 
Ritter: two UCSD students who 
were fined and jailed in Mayas a 
result of their participation in the 
protest of the construction of 
Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in 
New Hampshire. 

Erickson and Ritter told of their 
personal commitment to the 

is redirected to Boston industry. 
Ritter stre8led that the 

organJzational emphasis of the 
Clamshell AlUance 18 strictly 
peaceful, and he demonstrated the 
process of non-violence training 
with a fUm of the demonstration. 

Maay Protest 
The site, 40 miles north of 

Boston. drew large numben of 

criminal trespass, took place 
beginning May 1 and continued into 
the night. Authorities loaded 
demonstrators into school buses, 
and placed them in an annory, 
where they awaited mass trials. 
The sentencing for the protestors 
was 1S days in jail and a ,100 fine. 

The first several days of the 13 
spent at the annory the treatment 
was tenned "poor" and the food 
inadequate. "The only reason we 
survived was because we were 
prepared for a four day occupation 
of the nuke site," said Ritter. Both 
agreed that the conditions im-
proved considerably during the 
remainder of their retention. 

A "Tribal Daace" 
Worthy of anthropological note 

was a massive "tribal dance, " 
filmed with 650 people during a full 
moon at the time of the im-
prisonment. Said Ritter, "It 
continued for an hour and 40 
minutes and the guard was 
petrified during the entire time. He 
thought we were going to make a 
break for it!" 

Brian Ritter interviewed at a press conference Wednesday . 
halting of nuclear power, which 
prompted their April 3400 mile trek 
to the East, at a Wednesday press 
conference in the Student Center. 
As members of the citizen's anti-
nuclear power group. the Clam-
shell Alliance, the two participated 
in the non-violent demonstration 
and found it "a very encouraging 
experience. tt â¢ 

"We're Wlited against it," said 
Ritter of nuclear cQnstruction. He 
felt that there was more at stake 
than the safety hazards involved 
with nuclear power, citing possible 
violations of civil liberties and 
personal freedom. He said that 
those who benefited from nuclear 
power were utility companies. 
whose profits would double as a 
result. He explained that there is a 
30 percent energy surplus in New 
Hampshire and most of the excess

protestors from the' city area. The I 
crowd nwnbered 2500 at its height, 
and llKlO persons actually marched 
into the area surrounding the plant 
boWldaries on April 30 and spent 
the night there. 

On hand were state and local 
policemen. fropt Ule various
