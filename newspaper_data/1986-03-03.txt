Rare marine snail 
feeds off ray 

A rare marine snail which 
feeds off a powerful electric ray 
has been found by biological 
researchers at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. 

The snail is Cancellaria 
cooperi. of Cooper's nutmeg, a 
rwo-to three-inch gastropod 
found to the sub-tidal 
environment, resting partially 
buried on the ocean floor along 
California and Baja. 

The snail feeds on the Pacific 
electric ray, Torpedo californica, 
one of the most powerful electric 
predators in the ocean. 

The researchers first observed 
the snaIl feedmg on a Pacific 
electric ray whIle diving down 
about 75 feet off San Diego. 

Laboratory tests con firmed the 
parasitic feeding which doesn't 
seem to affect the ray. 

This IS the first time the 
feeding habits of any of the 73 
species of the Cancellaridae 
gastropod have been examined.

18,000 app-ly to UCSD 
UC aplications 
Up 108 percent 
By ANNA SEVERSON, Contriburing News Edltc i' 

T HE UNIVERSITY of Ca lifornia ' S new admissions system, 
allows students for the first 
time to apply' to any number of 
the system's eight campuses, 
which has resulted in an 
approximate 150 percent 
increase in UCSD applicants. 

The UC ~)/stem overall , had 
a 108 percent increase in 
applicants last year, with 
Riverside and Santa Cruz 
campuses increasing by over 
350 and 230 percent, 
respectively. 

UCSD had the largest 
increase for fall , according to 
the registrar, Ronald Bower. 
UCSD received 18,000 
applications for fall, up from 
7,000 in 1985. 

"We're referring 5,000 back 
to the campuswide system." 
Bower said. 

Fewer than 13,000 new 
students are expected to enroll 
at UCSD. This number will be 
determined after May I when 
students who have been 
admitted must choose the 
campus they intend to enroll 
in , according to Bower. 
Students will be notified by 
March 15 as to whether they 
have been admi[(ed. 

The increase in appli-
cations is a result of individual 
students filing mutiple 
appli<;ations, which they were 
not permitted to do under the 
old system. Bower said the 
administration had antici-
pated the increase and the 
actual number of students

applying to the overall-system 
has only risen about 2 percent. 

Under state law , all 
California students who have 
taken a required list of courses 
and who rank in the upper 
12.5 percent of their high 
school graduating class 
(approximately a 3.1 GPA), 
must be accepted to Uc. 

The state legislature is 
cu rrentl y reviewing the 
California Master Plan for 
Higher Education, which sets 
this percentage . 

William Frazer, senior vice 
president for academic affairs 
at the University of California, 
said that it is unlikely that the 
percentage will be lowered 
because it represents "a 
number relatively well in 
accordance with th e 
capabilities of the universi -
ties." 

Under the new system ·of 
enrollment, even if high 
school or transfer students are 
eligible , they a re not 
guaranteed a slot in the 
institution of their first choice. 
With the old procedure , those 
campuses that had more 
applications than they could 
handle automatically 
"redirected" students to 
campuses that were not full. 

'The new system will 
probably have little impact on 
a student's first choice," Frazer 
said , "but it could be a 
significant help in seeing that 
students at least get matched 
up with their second choice 
campus." ~

New zones to create jobs 
By NONIE GANAKIS. Staff Writer 

I N AN EFFORT to aid economically depressed areas of California, the 
Deukmejian administration has 
designated 13 communities, 
including the southeast section 
of San Diego as "enterprise ~ zones" where businesses are 

" granted tax breaks and other ! special incentives to hire the 

person , a sales laX credit for new 
equipment purchases and a 5 
percent income lax credit for 
workers hired inside the zones. 

The program was created 
under separate legislation 
authored by Republican 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan of 
Glendale and Democratic 
Assemyblywoman Maxine 
Walters of Los Angeles and 
Signed into law by Governor 
George Deukmejian in 1984.

He added that specifically in

San Diego county cities of 
Chula Vista, Imperial Beach,

among the Original applicants 
last year, but only'San Diego's

LAST WEDNESDAY, four member organizations of the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee ($MC) along 
with the Coalition for a Free 
South Africa organized a rally to 
address economic, racial and 
gender-based discrimination 
within the university. 

Nadir Haqq. emcee for the 
rally and an internal affairs 
intern for SAAC, and Dennard 
Clandenin , a BSU representative, 
called those at the rally to join in 
a march to Dean Varga's office at 
Third College. The march was 
intended to recognize the Third 
College Administration for its 
efforts to support Affirmative 
Action groups. 

The Asian Pacific Student 

Alliance (APSA), the Black 
Student Union (BSU), the 
Women's Resource Center, 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan (MEChA) and the 
Coalition aD gave speeches 
encouraging equaUty on campus 
and solidarity among affirmative 
action groups. 

Samoa Koria, a mernber of 
APSA, spoke first about the 
barriers that cross-cultural 
students face at the university, 
and he expressed the feeling that 
all cultures outside of the 
Western European tradition are 
being upset by the American 
bureaucracy. He cited the

California in the next 15 years. 

"Enterprise zones represent a 
tool for spurring new investment 
and job creation,· Walters said at 
a press conference. The 13 
communities chosen were among 
the 65 that applied for enterprise 
zone status. 

The enterprise zone program 
focuses on areas with high 
unemployment. In a move to 
revive business in such areas, 
state and local govemmer'lts will 
offer a range of special 
incentives to firms already 
situated inside the designated 
zones and to others that want to 
move into them, said Richard 
Whitman, [he Commerce 
Depanment's enterprise zone 
coordinator. 

Whitman said that among 
other things, the state plans to 
offer businesses inside the 
enterprise zones as much as 
$5 ,000 a year in income tax 
credits for hiring an unemployed 

ne ighborhoods. 
Whitman said that over a five-

year period , 7,000 new jobs will 
be created for unemployed San 
Diegans.

The inflexible DC system of ethnocentrism 
Although isolated incidents of overt racial and gender discrimination 

occur on campus, inequity generally takes a more subtle form . By faili ng 
to conSistently encourage participation in minority cultural and political 
events and indirectly elevating Western European culture by way of 
academia, the UC administration tacitly propogates ethnocentrism and 

studies are lumped together under the title of 'Third World Studies"; 
these programs are offered as "minor" programs only. Per~pective 
~pe.cia~ists and curious students alike are discouraged by the programs' 
hmltatlons. In contrast, the humanities sequence, which derives its focus 
from Western European culture, is a requirement for all Revelle students. 
The extension of this requirement to five quarters further decreases the 
chance that students will be exposed to the literature, politics, culture or 
social structures of the Third World. 

racial inequality. _ 
Illustrations of the hindrance of minority groups abound . The 

government of the Associated Students does not provide the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee with a voting membership; instead, 
SAACs position in the AS is "advisory." As a result, the views and values 
of SMCs member groups are not institutionalized within AS policy or 
decisions. Further, the A.S. sponsors events (such as T.G.s) that cater to 
mainstream culture, and it takes little effort to incorporate divergent 
cultural events into their agenda. 

The transformation of Lumumba-Zapata College (currently known as 
Third College) from a student-led governing body in the early 1970s to 
an administratively defeated , docile institution by 1977 is illustrative of 
how, at times, the more demanding voices of affirmative action groups 
are disenfranchized. The affirmative action programs that exist on 
campus today were primarily designed by the Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs; his role in the kind of recruitment and retention 
philosophy that underscores SMCs structure must never be overlooked. 
For it is the tradition of conflict between active affirmative action 
students and the inflexible system of power at UCSD that sheds the 
most light on our present state. At the anti-racism rally laSt Wednesday, 
this point was pOignantly exhibited: miles ot Anglo students walked by 
the speakers without so much as a waver in their step. This indignant 
posture taken by intolerant students who mostly oppose the reclamation 
of the ideals and values of Lumumba-Zapata College will only increase 
the antipathy that defines our ethnic boundaries. 

The p~int is not that Wetern European thought is not worthy of 
study. It IS, rather, that UCSD reflects its neglectful attitude toward 
diverge~t ethnic grou.ps through its policies. Thus far, these policies 
have failed to recognIze the equal value of 'Third World" studies, and, 
as a r~sult, implicidy co~done stu~ent . apathy and ignorance regarding 
the ~lstOry, values. and Vle.ws of mmonty groups. Such repression by the 
dommant culture IS espeCially destructive at a time when minority 
population are increasing exponentially within the United States. 
Assertion of the superiority of Western European tradition will only 
further polarize our society and reduce the chance for further 
agreements on public policy between peoples based on mutual 
understanding and respect. This potential type of open relationship will 
make possible the interaction that is necessary if minority groups are to 
m.aimain their cultural identity while at the same time participating, 
with an equal voice, in the creation of a virtuous U.s. popular culture. 

Perhaps it is for the very reason that "whites" in the United States feel 
invaded and threatened by divergent cultures that they continue to 
elevate "traditional American" values. Such a fear will only dissipate 
when the ignorance upon which it is based is eradicated. The 
univerSity, therefore, must serve as the center of learning and 

~nderstanding: its policies must be designed to engender participation 
In all types of cultural events and encourage the study of great thinkers 
other than the increasingly outdated John Locke and Adam Smith. The 
future of this univeristy depends on it. 

The educational studies programs (or, rather, lack thereof) exemplify 
the ethnocentricism that pervades UCSD. Chinese , African and Latino

Anti-Semitism? 
Editor: 

The issue I am concerned 
about is the bad taste Jim Berry 
cartoon on Mike Fahlbusch's and 
senior senators' door in the AS 
office. The cartoon portrays Yassir 
Arafat and Mohammar KadaR as 
silly Arab figures who are saying 
to each other, ' So, how's the 01' 
chemical balance in the brain 
today?" Above the charicature of 
Mr. Arafat is written "Byron" and 
above Mr. Kadafi is "Monte." 

Myself and Montgomery are 
members of the Alternative 
Media that Mr. Fahlbusch 
supposedly represents. I believe 
this portrait defames our image 
as Jews and the image of 
Palestinian Arabs - we resent it. 

Greg McCrone, who shares the 
office with Mr. Falhbusch , 
ad milled to me at last 
Wednesday's AS meeting that he 
put the cartoon on the door. Bur 
I feel Mr. Fahlbusch allowed the 
graphic to stay up for over a 
week, and allowing it to stay up 

there is, in my opinion, 
irresponsible for a public official. 

A member of the Union of 
Jewish Students saw the graphic 
and stated it was "unacceptable" 
for an elected official to allow 
this action . I caU on Mr. 
Fahlbusch to explain why this 
graphic is on his door, and why 
he allows it to continue. 

1 also question the character of 
this public official who now 
takes over for former Vice 
President Arid Anguiano. He 
must represent all students in his 
position as communications 
commissioner and chair of AS 
meetings. He must protect 
student rights , not allow them to 
be stepped upon . I call on Mr. 
Fahlbusch to remove this 
distorted representation 
immediately, and remove himself 
and Mr. McCrone from public 
office!

The wrong spirit 
Editor: 

Having attended the laSt 
Triton basketball game of the 
season, I returned to my room 
not only disappointed at our 
team's loss , but disgusted with 
the "organizations" that attended. 
The Greeks showed up to cheer 
for their own benefit rather than 
for the UCSD basketball team. 
During previous games that I've 
gone to I've noticed a few 
regulars, not necessarily Greek 
members, who initiated cheers to 
demonstrate their suppOrt for the 
players. At this game they were 
present to compete with the 
players for anention. It was sad 
to see the Greeks interrupting 
both teams, demonstrating their 
disregard for the match that was 
taking place. They were 
competing amongst themselves. 
I'm dismayed with the Greek 
system, for they had the chance 
to show their honest suppOrt for 
the Tritons , and they impressed 
only the judges. I hope that we'll 
be seeing the Greeks n~xt season 
cheering for our team, not 
themselves. I wish them luck in 
c hanging their image .

finding true alternatives to the 
"Fahlbusch Proposal." One can 
only hope the new committee 
can continue the work from the 
old committee in prodUcing a 
viable soulution to the alternaive 
media funding problem, and put 
it before the students in the next 
election. 

Procedurally, the meeting was 
something barely short of a 
nightmare. The way in which the 
proposals for reform came onto 
the floor did not provide 
everyone with a clear 
understanding of the intent or of 
the implications of making a 180 
degree shift in policy. There was 
just too much going on too fast 
to fully realize what policy moves 
were taking place. A concern that 
was brought up is the fact that 
one of the goals of the 
committee is to bring a 
referendum before the council to 
be put on the spri ng ballot. The 
due date is this Tuesday. Can we 
expect this new committee, 
although composed of members 
from the "old committee, to 
come up with a referendum that 
will work? One had better hope 
so because this is probably the 
last hope for the alternative media 
before next year's AS budget IS 
introduced . 

One has to commend Michael 
Fahlbusch for his superb job as 
chairman of the counell . It 
obviously was not the easIest Job 
to control a vocal group m the 

audience, and a vocal council, 
while at the same time 
preserving the integrity of one's 
character along with one's sanity. 

One thing that I found most 
refreshing was the amount of 
concern expressed by various 
people in the room that night. 
The circumstances which 
brought them to the meeting that 
night were unfortunate in their 
nature (the reSignation of a 
councilmember) , but it was the 
impetus that united them once 
again for a worthy cause. 
Although I don't always agree 
with their views of UCSD or of 
the AS, I will admit that many of 
the statements and concerns 
voiced were valid and wonh 
thinking deeply about. 

I look at these recent events 
not as a tremendous turnaround 
in attitudes by either side, but as 
a welcomed change in the favor 
of more open dialogue and 
hopefully more mutual 
understanding about the terrible 
dilemma both the AS and the 
alternative media face .. let's see if 
we can't work on improving this 
relationship even more .

OPINIONS 

When good faith becomes debunked 
It is our position that the AS. 

Subcommittee on Alternative 
MedIa is a farce . It is true that 
on January 22 we urged the AS. 
Council to pass John Riley's bill 
that would have crea ted an ad 
hoc committee to study 
Alternative Media funding 
options. We felt at that time that 
Riley's proposed committee , 
which included two 
representaives of the Alternative 
Media,was the best option this 
council would make available to 
us. We were willing to 
participate in good faith in 
Riley's proposed ad hoc 
committee in order to formulate 
a reasonable plan to incorporate 
any new alternative media into 
the o.vera ll budget. Unfortunately, 
the AS. Council majority, led by 
Communications Commissioner 
Michael Fahlbusch and ASUCSD 
President Mary Rose Alexander, 
was determined to silence the 
progressive Alternative Media 
and was in no mood to 
negotiate. The council openly 
displayed its hostility at the Jan . 
22 meeting by overwhelmingly 
adopting Fahlbusch's 
controversial budget proposal 
despite' our vehement/rorest. 
Fa hlbusch had devise his plan 
without any input whatsoever 
from the Alternative Media. 

The council then proceeded to 
mock the intent of John Rileys 
proposal by passing a completely 
d istoned version of his bill. 
Riley's ad hoc committee was 
meant as an alternative to 
Fahlbusch's misguided and 
drastic proposal. Its purpose was 

to formulate vanous Alternative 
Media fundmg options and then 
present them directly to the 
students for consideration. By 
(irst approving Fahlbusch's 
budget proposal and then 
stripping Riley's committee of 
any significance, howe ver. the 
counc il was once again 
demonstrating its commitment to 
censor the progressive Alternative 
Media. 

The council' attack on Riley's 
bill was led by President 
Alexander. The Riley bill was 
amended in the follOWing ways: 
1.) The term "ad hoc committee" 
was changed to "subcommittee" 
to ensure the committee's 
dependence on the council. 
2.) The President then changed 
its c?mposition by removing 
both Alternative Media 
representatives, one of the 
stu~ents at large and one of the 
media board representatives. In 
their place she added two AS. 
Counci l members. The 
subcommittee is now composed 
of one chair appOinted by the 
president, twO AS. 
councilmembers, one 
representative of the media 
board and one student at large . 
3.) The president next a ltered 
the mandate of the 
subcommittee. Riley had 
proposed that the committee 
formulate "funding" options. But 
Alexander changed this wording 
to "funding or not funding." 
4.) Finally, the president 
reworded Riley' language so that 
"all options formulated by this 
committee be submitted to the 

councd to detert)1ine wordmg 
before presenting these options 
to the students." That is , 
Alexander reassured that the 
council would have total control 
over the subcommittee. 

On Monday we were greeted 
by an article in the UCSD 
Guardian which indicated that 
some AS. officials are unable to 
condone these totalitarian tactics 
any longer. Administrative Vice 
President Ariel Anguiano has 
resigned in disgust, telling the 
Guardian that, "It's a matter of 
principle , they don 't want to give 
an alternative view ... the student 
representatives are not 
representing the students." We 
could not have said it any better 
ourselves. 

Anguiano had appointed 
Sergio Chavez to the Alternative 
Media subcommittee as student 
at large but the AS. council had 
refused to approve his 
appOintment. Instead, the 
council approved Riley's former 
roommate, Barry Harris, a 
student at large. Again, we quote 
Anguiano: "I was disillusioned by 
the council. We only trust our 
own people, and if we have an 
attitude like that you can't be too 
representative.". 

Anguiano agreed , in the 
Guardian article , that the AS. had 
gutted Riley's proposal. "It went 
from a really representative 
committee to an AS. committee ," 
said AngUiano. Referring to the 
fact that the A.S. president had 
eliminated fair media 
representation on the committee, 
John Riley said, "Mary Rose kind 

of eliminated it ... Ariel and 
myself were totally upset with the 
change." 

We have just examined the 
history of the A1temative Media 
subcommittee. We supported the 
ad hoc committeee as orignally 
proposed by John Riley. Not only 
has the Alternative Media voice 
been eliminated, but in the 
words of Bany Harris, the 
subcommittee is "powerless ." The 
AS. clearly demonstrated its 
unwillingness to hear 
constructive alternatives within 

even its own rigged forum when 
it rejected Sergio Chavez as 
student at large. For all these 
reasons we have concluded that 
participation in this 
subcornmittee would be nothing 
but futile .

revolutionaries (who cpenly 
verbalize their intentions of 
attacking Nicaragua) in Miami 
and California is in VIOlation of 
U.S. Federal Law, which 
prohibits the provision of 
sanctuary for any individuals 
WIth the intention of engaging in 
violence tOwards any country 
WIth whom the United tates has 
diplomatiC relations 

The president also makes 
some very dubious assenions 
regarding the morality of the 
counter-revolutionary war. In the 
name of freedom, democracy 
and human rights. a war is being 
waged against the democratically 
elected Sandinista govenment. It 
must be remembered , though, 
that the costs of the systematic 
destabilization of Nicaragua are 
most directly felt by the 
Nicaraguan people . Iflhe 

Reagan Administration was 
indeed concerned about the 
welfare of Nicaraguan , would it 
purposely condemn them to 
continued (and worsening) 
poverty, disease and hunger? 
Objections to human rights' 
abuses in Nicaragua have 
become a transparent disgui e 
for the attempt to maintain U .. 
hegemony in the Western 
Hemisphere . The use of terror 

• and repression by the 
government of neighboring EI 
Salvador, because of its pro-U .S. 
stance and non-socialistic nature , 
IS overlooked by the 
administratlon. The ObVlOUS 
inconsistency renders Reagan's 
appeals to "inalienahle human 
rights" hollow. 

Despite its alleged devonon to 
the equality of states and the 
inviability of territory, the Reagan 
administration's policy illusmltes 
its belief that the United StateS 
has the right to detennine the 
appropriate system of 
government for Nicaragua. Far 
from honoring Nicaragua's right 
to self-determination, the United 
States has demonstrated a lack 
of respect for the will of the 

icaraguan people and their 
abihty to determine the course of 
their future , independem of 
either superpower. In fact, it is 
precise ly thi policy of non-
alignment that the admini tration 
finds threatening. 

The administration has relied 
on the use of disinformation and 

half-truth~ in order to justify its 
response to this supposed threat. 
The "White Paper" was released 
in 1981, twO weeks after news of 
the document as "leaked." The 
document. prior to its release, 
was said to comain irrefutable 
evidence that the Sandmistas 
were allied with the oviet Union 
and Cuba in their anempt to 
destabilize the region through 
the expon of revolution to EI 
Salvador. The two-week 
discrepancy between the "leak" 
and the actual release of the 
document was a major public 
relations victory for the 
administration; because of the 
discrepancy, researchers were 
unable to determine until later 
that much of the evidence was 
falsified and the documents 
forged 

In fact , despite many 

allegations made by CIA, 
Pentagon and admini stralion 
offi ials, no evidence of 
infiltra tion or of the existence of 
Soviet bases in Nicaragua, has 
been produced. Reagan funher 
obscures the facts by depicitng 
the andinistas as a firm ally of 
the Soviet Union. In fact, 
Nicaragua has received much of 
its aid from Canada and 
Western Europe , and , in spite of 
the devastation of its country by 
the United States, remains non-
aligned with eith'er superpower. 

But for some, the illegality, 
immorality and illegitimacy of 
the Reagan Administration's 
policy is irrelevant. For these 
people, perceived national 
interest supercedes questions of 
morali ty and fact. To these 
people, it can be said that 
current U.S. policy, even with 
increased aid, cannot achieve a 
counter-revolution. While it is 
true that this policy may spreld 
discontentment among 
Nicaraguans, it is not true that 
this disillusionment will lead the 
people to support the contras. 
Within Nicaragua, the Contras 
are associated with two despised 

forces: the United States and 
Somoza's National Guard . any 
funher destruction in NIcaragua 
will simply increase antipathy 
towards the United States and its 
"solution." A Sandinista 
ovenhrow would require a full-
scale U.S. invasion, which , most 
likely as result of economic and 
public image concerns, the 
United States has been reluctant 
to initiate. 

Contrary to the aUegatio.ns 
made by Cold War rhetoriticlans, 
the Sandinistas are not part of 
an attempt at world domination 
by an evil empire. The 
Nicaraguan govemment is the 
result of the popular overth row 
of the ryrannical rule of the 
Somoza family, which enjoyed 
U.S. financial and moral suppOrt 
throughout its existence. It is 
time that the United States alters 
its course, and tenninates its 
contribution to the poveny and 
misery that plagues Nicaragua. 
Rejection of the demands for 
social change in the Third World 
will simply increase the 
polarization that characterizes 
U.S. relationship with those 
countries. ~

now campaigning as an example 
of the way that reo pie of 
differing cultura origins are 
being stripped of their rights to 
speak their own languages. 

Next, Cheryl Canwright, a 
representative of the Women's 
Resource Center, spoke to 
"encourage unity between the 
minority factions on campus." 
She briefly discussed several 
issues which are peninent to the 
rights of women. 

Clendenin opened his speech 
by asking for "solidarity and 
suppon between brothers and 
sisters to end racism, sexism and 
elitism." He asserted that 
affirmative action students 
should "find unity in a collective 
effort and no longer suffer 
manipulation by the 
administration." 

"We should no longer fight 
among ourselves, but, together, 
we should hold Chancellor 
Atkinson and the administration 

responsible for the problems that 
exist." He added that the 
university has been closed and 
unresponsive to the problems of 
a ffirmative ac tion groups in the 

. past, but that the "power 
brokers· (administrators) must 
face up to the discrepancies that 
they have previously overlooked. 

Russel Andalcio spoke as a 
representative of the Coalition 
for a Free South Africa. Andalcio 
recently came into conflict with 
the university administration 
after he aUegedly committed a 
lynching action after Bishop 
Desmond Tutu's speech on 
Thursday, Jan. 23. 

"The education system is one 
of the most important means for 
propagating the dominant 
culture ," Andalcio said. His 
feeling is that the university is 
unresponsive to minority cultures 
because it is based upon 
strengthening and upholdine the 
Western European culture that 
created it. He also stated his 
belief that "the dominant 
culture is inherently oppresive 
and repressive of people who are 
not white, male and of European 
origin." 

Josefina Chavez of MEChA 

brought to issue the "blatant case 
of racism against Sergio Chavez." 
Sergio Chavez was originaUy 
replaced b'( Barry Harris in the 
position 0 "student at large" on 
the AS Council's alternative 
media funding committee. Last 
Wednesday, the council 
appOinted both Harris and 
Chavez to a new subcommittee 
on alternative media funding. J. 
Chavez demanded "an end to 
harassment of Chicanos and 
Mexicanos on campus." She 
urged students to "unite and 
protest and fight for students' 
rights." 

Haqq closed by asking 
students to make the 
administration accountable for 
their positions and actions. Haqq 
also encouraged students to 
actively become involved in 
changing the university'S 
policies. "Although the 
administration has great 
responSibility, it is the need of 
every student to make a move to 
change the university. We must 
learn to have the tenacity to 
understand other people and nOl 
just lock ourselves into our own 
thing," Haqq said. 

"SAACs primary charge is to 

be an adviSOry committee to the 
Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs ," 
according to Denise Miura, an 
external affairs intern for SM C. 
But the affirmative action groups 
and organizations associated 
with SMC are seeking to affect 
the university in more than just 
an advisory capacity. SAAC 
members are investigating issues 
and facilities important to 
affirmative action students, and 
they are trying to remedy areas 
which cause affirmative action 
students difficulties. 

SAAC members are working 
with various departments on 
campus in order to provide 
directly for the needs of 
affirmative action students. 
Michael Chavez, a research 
intern for OASIS and a 
representative on SMC, has 
recently been trying to encourage 
minority students to use the 
computer facilities which were 
established speCifically to aid 
affirmative action groups.

SAAC has begun studies to 
quantify the effects of Satisfactory 
Academic Progress requirements 
and to determine the retention 
ra tes of Affirmative Action 
students. According to Haqq, 
these two impact studies have 
been designed to assess the 
financial and academic needs 
and problems of affirmative 
action students. 

"We (BSU) are in full solidarity 
with the other affirmative action 
groups," Clendenin said. "The 
presence of affirmative action 
students on campus is 
dwindling, and we want to begin 
to resolve the current attack on

An island besieged by a stonny sea 
By TOM PLONKA 

I HEAR AND SMELL THE essence of nature. Conversely, I cannot help 
but hear the sounds of 
civilization. Thunderous jets and 
four wheeled vehicles abound, 
spewing their combustible 
remnants that mask the sounds 
and smells of nature. A butterfly 
flurters by and a lizard silently 
and quickly scurries across my 
gaze. A squirrel chases his mate 
playfully through the grass. Here 
is an island of nature amidst a 
sea of mechanization. Wheeled 
vehicles and concrete structures 
create a shrinking noose 
encircling this island of nature. 

The traffic is a mechanical 
medium which ciruculates 
through concrete veins, choking 
the island of nature with its ever 
tightening grip. The island of 
nature is shrinking, the walls of 
civilization are closing in. The 
sea is rising and the shores are 
receding. Are there not dykes to 
prevent this invasion of 
concrete? Ay, but the level of this 
island falls below the precipice 
of civilization: it cannot help but 
be engulfed by its over-
empowering presence. 

A la~e black beetle is Sitting 
on the end of my pen. Irs 
progress is interrupted by 
anOther's interests. Bm my 
strength overrules the 
discontentment of the loathsome 
creature. \ hear that new building 
will be erected on this very spot 
in the near future . A sadness fills 
my heart as I watch a sman bird 
at my feel But the strength and 
power of the "estabhshment" 
overrules my discontentment. 
Like the diplaced beetle, I'll find 
another place to be. 

The hard contrast between 
na ture and civilization creates an 
unseen barrier. What is out of 
sight, is usually out of mind . One 
can scarcely notice the beauty of 
nature, secluded in his vehicle 
complete with air-conditioning 
and FM stereo. As one attains 
the speed of 70 miles per hour 
in order to make his 
appointment on time, the 
squirrel that was crossing the 
road creates a mere, r.luted 
thump. The distraction is barely 
noticed. On the other side of the 
barrier the other squirrel on the 

, 

edge of the road waits for its 
mate to arrive. The delicate state 
of nature is an unimportant 
entity taken for granted in man's 
busy schedule . 

I feel separated from the 
world, sitting on this stump, in a 
clearing of some woods in La 
Jolla . People in the cars passing 
by don't care, because they don't 
know I'm here. Their world is 
contained in a metal box, 
speeding down the freeway 

secluded from my world . But my 
world is their world, and theirs 
is mine. To separate myself from 
their world is to separate myself 
from ours. This feeling of 
separation must be transcended 
to one of harmony. A uniry must 
be attained to form a compatible 
relationship between man and 
nature. 

The displacement of nature is 
the contemporary method of 
man's development. Like the 
swath of a hurricane, huge 
chunks of land are flattened or 
filled to the developer's desire. 

Unlike the areas flattened by the 
hUrricane , the damage created is 
permanent Like the womb of 
Mother Ocean, the vital estuaries 
which provide the birth site for 
our fisheries, are filled . 
Mountains are leveled, along with 
nesting areas of many forms of 
wildlife, futher disrupting the 
natural cycle of the food chain. 
When men can control 
development of our resources by 
living side by side with nature 

instead of thrOwing her out, a 
priceless covenant will have been 
reached. Such endeavors rake 
time and money, entities which 
are nOl available or are not made 
available. Thus, the fight for 
nature's survival and the survival 
of mankind, can be said to be a 
losing battle. 

As I sit upon my log in the 
woods, I think ofthe many 
things for which we are 
dependent upon nature. A small 
patch of land has been cleared at 
my feet and a lemon tree stands 
to my left. Vegetables, fruit and 

grain wil1 not grow in concrete. 
Mankind cannot prosper without 
nature's life giving blood. 

As men come with thei r 
machines, our garden will slowly 
be lost. When our life is sealed 
under cement, and our island of 
nature is gone, the value of this 
jewel will then be noticed . The 
whimpering of a child as he 
loses his mother, is at most, a 
feeble sound. The cry of a grown 
man is feebler still as he stands 

amongst his ruins. 
Mankind must succumb to the 

power of Mother Nature. He has 
to live by her terms, or die by 
his own. Does man feel he can 
strike a deal with the biology of 
nature? Such is equal to reverSing 
gravi ty. Nature is us and we are 
nature. Until we can accept this 
marriage, love and cherish it, we 
can only hope to continue our 
existence on this earth. But 
misplaced and misbalanced 
power amongst our society is 
making this cooperation 
continually tougher to attain. 

Thus, the delicate balance 
between men and nature will 
co ntinue to tilt. The dew arops 
cling to the slender blade of 
grass, glittering in the sunlight. . 
They stick to my terinis shoes as 
\ stroll to the edge of the 
clearing. A hummingbird hovers 
and darts from side to side. The 
warm sun, bright colors and 
pungent smells of nature bring 
peace of mind to those who give 
them their time. To become part 
of such a world is to get in touch 
with oneself. 

We co ntinually deny ourselves 
such pleasure in the name of 
responsibility. I must lay my 
work down, restore the part of 
myself which can become muted 
by repetition of lifestyle. When 
the repetition of daily chores 
becomes inherent, a change is 
necessary to remove that 
inherent quality. The entities of 
nature which toughen the senses 
can restore that part of oneself. 

Slowly killing off parts of 
nature is slowly killing off 
ourselves. These areas are 
needed , not only to nourish our 
mental sta te. but also our 
physical sta te . Her mountains, 
lake and oceans provide us wih 
countless forms of recreatioon. 
Her plains and fertile va lleys 
provide us with the bulk of our 
food. Our stoves and refrigerators 
would be useless wuhout food to 
put in them. All of our 
painstaking labor would be futile 
without a place to spend the 
fruits on it. 

The movement of the vehicles 
has not slowed down. A 
thunderous jet soars across my 
gaze. The faint smell of car 
exhaust taints the afternoon air. I 
spot the lizard that I saw an 
hour ago. This small island of 
nature is still shrinking and the 
sea is still rising. The large black 
beetle is still walking in a circle, 
confused in its new 
surroundings. The squirrel is also 
confused . The man in his new 
car made his appointment, but 
he cursed as he noticed some 
red on his white paint. But the 
sun is still shining, and the birds 
are still singing. Thus, there is 
still hope. 

Now I must get back to class, 
and then drive home. Ii:d 

Something snaps, and your 
world turns upside-down 
By JOHN ROSEN 

DOUG WALKED INTO the cafe and almost burst into tears. RaiSing a 
heavy book high over his head , 
he wailed in a pathetic tone, "I 
don't eXist! I am no longer real!" 

Then he wavered for a brief 
moment, and collapsed In 
exhaustion ontO the cold , 
hnoleum floor of the cafe. 

HIS fnends Sitting at the table 
~tared down at him. They placed 
their coffee cups back into their 
dishes and contemplated the 
shallowly breathing mass of 
rumpled human sprawled 
beneath them on the floor. 

One girl spoke up; ' Who's 
that?" she asked , and looked to 
her fnends. 

"\ think I know him ," someone 

answered. "See if you can turn 
him on his back so I can see his 
face." 

The request was obeyed , and 
the unconscious body revealed

to a student of the computer 
SCiences, by the name of Douglas 
Cooper, III 

His wire rimmed eye-glasses 
hung loosely down around his 
mouth . His sandy red hair was 
wet and matted, and perspiration 
was abundant over his entire 
person. Even asleep. dfad to the 
cares 01 the world , his 
appearance gave off the 
impres:.wn of a week of sleepless 
and frantl c nights. Even In total 
relaxation , hi face was marked 
with deep wTlnkJes of concern . It 

was immediately clear to all who 
looked down upon him that his 
was a situation of some gravity, 
and he had undergone great 
strains in the past few days. 

"Somebody throw some cold 
water on him ," it was suggested. 
"Water costs five cents. Coffee 
refills are free," a voice add~d . 
"It 'd be cheaper to throw coffee 
on him." 

In a while , he was Sitting in a 
chair at the table shivering 
slightly, not from the cold , but 
from some deeply chilling 
anxiety. When pressed by hiS 
friends, he began to relate the 
nature of his obseSSIOn, in all its 
terrifying nakedness. 

Hi eyes searched the ground

around "the table, and slowly 
came to rest upon the book he 
had entered with, lying still and 
open beneath a chair. 

"That," he pointed at the book, 
trembling, "is the most profane, 
most evil work of man since the 
fall of Lu ifer from heaven." 

"I want you all to know," he 
said, his voice a bit more easy 
and relaxed, "that I'm not usually 
so emotlonal. I'm really a very 
sober person. I mean , computers 
are my life, professionaOy and 
socially. I've got no lime for

He ran his hand over his

of water. ' 

"But that book - that book is 

a crime," he said, "and it was 
thrust on me without warning -
cruelly." 

Someone .picked the book off 
the floor and dusted the dirt off

"It's a computer book - a

At the end of this remarkble

familiar "he" in his computer

inexplicable reason , Doug had 
been unable to accept a text in 
which the user was presumed to 
be female instead of male. To be 
fair, it was not unusual for Doug 
to be surprised and affected by 
the change. Rarely, if ever, has 
any text assumed the impersonal

reader to be anything but male. It 
means nothing, and remains 
only as matter of custom and 
tradition; a means to standardize 
and avoid confusion. But for 
Doug the strain was too great. He 
could not adjust to the simple , 
easy transition . He could not 
learn to ignore the pronoun and 
continue on with his studies. 
Who knows? Perhaps there was 
something very deep and 
mysterious in his character that 
would help make sense of the 
matter. But, as It stands today, 
Doug has been and will remain , 
a devoted lodger at some remote 
and lonely rest home in the 
mountains. Some have put 
forward the theory that Doug 
was, in fact, a robot, whose 
programming could not accept 
any alterations. But this idea is 
mostly disregarded in circles that 
know about such things, and do 
not care, more or less, about

Nittany Lions maul Tritons, 
UCSD rallies against La Verne 
By TOM FERGUSON, Staff Wnler 

T HE UCSD MEN'S volleyball team had a busy schedule this past weekend with 
two back-ro-back matches, on 
Friday night against lOth-ranked 
Penn State , and one on Saturday 
night at the University of 
laVeme. Both matches were 
played without the presence of 
head coach Digger Graybill, who 
was welcoming a new addition 
to his family. 

At the Triton Pavillion Friday, 
the Tritons lost three straight, 8-
15, 4-15, 7-15. According to 
UCSD assistant coach Adam 
Cheny, "No single person was 
bad ... we didn't play up to our 
potential, but Penn State (18-6) 
was a better team." UCSD was 
ahead in the first I!ame 5-0. then 

"things JUSt fell apart." The- force 
of Penn State was freshman 
Chris Chase, who at six-foot-
nine, was hitting over everyone 
(the tallest Triton is si~-foot-five). 
The Tritons were also plagued 
with errors, committing 12 
service and 25 hitting errors. 
Individually, Jeff Babcock had 10 
kills and a .421 hitting 
percentage , and Eric Hallman 
had three kills and a .400 
percentage . All other T-ritons had 
negative hitting percentages, and 
UCSD finished with only .046 
percent on 85 attempts to Penn 
State's .247 percent. also on 85 
attempts. 

On Saturday. things seemed to 
fall apart at first, as UCSD lost 
the first twO games ro LaVerne. 

Southern Utah trips 
UCSD, tel11pers flare 
By JOHN SCHACHT, sports Edilor 

I N FRONT OF hardly anyone, Southern Utah State handed UCSD's baseball team 
a 5-2 loss last Friday at Olsen 
field . An error by third baseman 
Derek Alkonis allowed two 
uneamed runs to score in Utah's 
three-run seventh. breaking open 
a close game and sending the 
Trirons to their eighth loss 
against five wins and a tie. 

Rick Houghton pitched no-hit 
ball for Utah through the first 
four innings before the TritOns 
CUt into a 2-0 Utah lead with an 
RBI single from Alkonis in the 
si xth . Utah drew first blood in 
the second when they scored 
two runs off starter and loser 
Casey Morales (0-1). Two 
doubles and an RBI single by DH 
T om Griffen accounted for the 
twO Utah runs. 

In the Utah seventh . Griffen 
led off with his second hit , a 
single, before being sacrificed to 
second. Dan Spilker singled 
Griffen to third , and Tom 
Federico sin~ed in Utah's third 
run . John LuTmdahl, Utah's 

third-place hitter, hit a grounder 
to third that Alkonis threw into 
right center uying to get the 
force at second. Triron coach 
Lyle Yates argued that the runner 
going to third had obscured 
Alkonis' vision . but to no avail. 

After the game, several of the 
Tritons mixed it up with some of 
Utah's fans and bench jockeys 
who had been verbally abusing 
the Tritons , their coach and 
what few UCSD fans were there 
throughout the game. Coming to 
an un-landlocked non-Mormon 
state must have been a little 
much for the Utah bench, whose 
tact included abUSing an elderly 
Triton fan as well. 

Derek Alkonis, who was within 
earshot of the Utah bench all 
game, gOt into it with some of 
the fans for about 45 seconds 
before he and several other 
Tritons were restrained . "Derek's 
personality is Ii ke that," said 
assistant coach Tom Cartier. 
"He's a real quiet guy, but he'll 
take only so much from guys like 
that." ~ 

Coach Cheny said that the had 
staned a few back-up players 
against the supposedly weaker 
LaVerne squad . but, in order not 
to jeopardize the win, replaced 
them with his regular starters, 
The Tritons regrouped , winning 
the next three games and the 
mat h ll-lS, 10-15, 15-7 , 15-2. 
15-9, ~ 

Fencers· 
finish 
first 

For the first time since 1973, 
the UCSD epee team brought the 
Southem California Collegiate 
Fencing Conference first-place 
trophy home. Coach Anronelli 
expressed her delight by saying, 
"We've been so close for several 
of the five years rve been here , 
this time there was no stopping 
us." 

Sunday was the last 
confe'rence meet where UCSD 
was pitted against CSULB and 
UClA One of the major 
highlights of the day was epee 
team captain Mark Christies' 
first-place individual' finish. 
Christie came up from second 
place to tie leader Bill Robensone 
of CSUlB and then defeated him 
in a sudden death fence-off for 
fir-st place. Teammate Chris 
Dorger's solid 6-0 performance 
helped cinch the match for a 5-4 
victory against CSULB and a 9-0 
victory against UCLA, giving 
UCSD a final team record of lS-
I for the day. Overall , UCSD beat· 
UCtA 19-8, but lost to CSULB 
12-15 to take second in the 
conference. 

The men's foil team fought 
valiantly to beat CSULB 7-2, but 
could not unseat first-place 
U<!LA, thus settled uncontested 
for second place. Individually, 
epee team member Chris Dorger 
finished the season 40-8 to place 
fourth. Foil team captain Kevin 
Mills finished 39-9 for a third 
place in foil.

By FLIP HARRISON 
Buddy, can you spent a dime? 

The UCSD Triton women's 
basketball team thrashed Christ 
College with an undergraduate 
population of 250. Maybe next 
year we should throw in some 
high school teams on the 
women's schedule. The root of 
this type of overmatching, 
however. comes not from zealous 
scheduling by women's coach 
Judy Malone but rather from an 
unwillingness of UCSD 
administrators to remove barriers 
ro help keep the team at a low 
level of play. With these shackles 
of administrative policy, the team 
is unable to advance its level of 
play beyond Division III 
placement, and is left playing 
schools like Christ College, 
Understandably, coach Judy 
Malone is getting tired of it. 

"It's hard to produce a 
winning program when I can't 
olTer the things a DiviSIOn I team 
offers ," said coach Malone. "I 
have already lost twO prospective 
players to Division I programs. It 
is also hard to find good ball 
players who have a 3.0 gpa with 
SAT scores of 1,000, which I 
ha ve to find to get past 
administrative reqUirements." 

Friday night's Triton season-
ending game was typical in that 
it featured basement level college 
basketball and that it was viewed 
by a small, unenthusiastic crowd 
of about 40 dispersed throughout 
the Main Gym. The reason for 
lack of school spirit is not hard 
to pinpoint; the women were 10-
14 going into the game and had 
no chance of going to regionals 
even with a victory over lowly 
Christ College. And the students 
rushing to the gym in time for 
founh quaner knew this ; they 

were coming for the after-game 
air band contest. 

The basketball program is not 
to blame for this year-in, year-out 
situation. The team has a good, 
concerned coach in Judy Malone 
and is given aU-out effon from all 
of its players. More exactly, this 
situation comes from an 
administration that is unwilling 
to give the funding necessary to 
put better spons teams on our 
fields and couns. 

It is easy to figure out 
administrative reasoning in 
keeping intact the restraints. The 
priority for the school is 
excellence in academics, both for 
the reputation of a young UCSD 
and in the interest of 
advancement of its students. And 
rightfully, the money students 
pay for a good education in a 
reputable school should go to 
that goal. However, this 
approach blinds the 
administration to the fact that 
excellence in both academics 
and athletics is possible. In fact. 
the two can, if checked carefully, 
greatly enhance one another. 
And it is the limited thinking of 
our UCSD administration that 
fails to see this possibility. Or, 
even if they are aware of this 
potential, they are unwilling to 
make the primary financial 
sacrifices to start in progress a 
good 'spons program at UCSD. 

The administration has a hard 
time justifying funneling money 
into atheltics that should go 
toward academic advancement. 
The notion is "a dollar towards 
athletics is a dollar away from 
academics." However, at 
universities with major spons 

programs, the athletic programs 
not only pay for themselves, but 
also provide hundreds of 
thousands of dollars that can go 
towards other school interests. At 
UCSD we could have, with a 
good athletic program, revenue 
from fans . sponsors, alumni and

more students and gIve 
graduating students a better 
chance at jobs outside of the San 
Diego county radius. At prese nt, 
the admi nistration IS hoping a 
nationwide reputation will come 
from word of mouth and the 
achievements of UCSD 

programs. 
An added bonlls to a good 

sports program at UCSD would 

be to insen a certain amount of 
school spirit in a school that 
with four sub-colleges lacks 
ovemO unity. Admini st ra tors. 
realizing this problem, have 
already taken steps to give the 
university some cohesion by. 
among other actions, 
encouraging a Greek network at 
UCSD. Taking a step down from 
their academic ideals, the 
administration has helped create 
a Greek system at the school to 
stir more student involvement at 
UCSD. Another and more 
intelligent route. to this goal 
would be ro proVide winning 
teams that all students at UCSD 
could suppon and feel proud of. 
Thus athletics could also provide 
an activity for all students and 
would help to alleviate some of 

the current abse nce 01 school 
spI rit. 

UCSD administrators, through 
their adhenng to a policy which 
they feel will provide for the best 
advancement of academics, are 
negl,:cting to provide more 
capital for academic purposes as 
well as national attention that 
would give UCSD a more renown 
name. A'change in 

Continued from page 12 
- dare I say - T.v. rights that 
could proVide capital for 
research, buildings, libraries and 
other academic tools. Thus, 
money invested in a winning 
UCSD spons program could 
easily provide additional capital 
resources to be used for UCSD 
academics. Just such a program 
has been successfully instituted 
at UC Berkeley. 

administrative policy must occur 
that will allow coaches like Judy 
Malone more financial freedom , 
recruiting breaks and other 
sweeping reforms to put good 
spons programs on our fields 

Administrative officials are also 
Slriving for nationwide academic 
recognition that would bring in 

graduates. A much swifter route 
must be taken, a route that can 
be al:hicvcd by athletics, 1', good 
spons program would bring 
nationwide attention to UCSD, 
Attention on the school would 
create a national awareness of 
UCSD's unmatched academic 
achievements. Thus, athletics 
could also provide national 
recognition to a school that 
desperately needs it. Both UCLA 
and Stanford academics have 
capitalized on such sports Coach Judy Malone 

and couns. Maybe then we can 
SlOp playng six-member Christ 
College teams and create some 
school spirit in a school that has

This week's Miller Team of the Week was supposed to be one of our more 
devastating single A teams. La Machine. These guys look like the reincarnation of the 
New York IsliWlders. No one had come dose to knad<lng La MachIne affyet this ~ar. 
That was until last Satur~ at 1:00 in the Recerdome. La MachIne met some guys 
who dictl't know how good #1 was supposed to be and lost 4-2. No~ treats #1 
like that. They rrust hale been cropped on their heads whim created brain damage. 
In fact Brain Damage Is the name of this squad. 

The most damage was done I1i the most obiiously damaged squad member, Leo 
Szymanski. Leo you weren't supposed to score all' those goals. Another demented 
member is goalie CI¥k Brace. It's self explanatory how rrum damage he had. A~ 
one who stands In front of a net and has people shoot small flying ot!jects at him at 
00 mph Is crllZ'j. Defensively Brian Caldwell leads the squad. The word is to st"" 
aw"" from Brian's side of the IIoor because his bite ~ be rabid. Lastly. the leading 
candidate A:>r a frontal Iobo~ Is aptaln Greg Salata. Can you imagine being a 
team leader on this goup of crazies?

An Open Letter to the ASUCSD 
Dear Student, 

I am writing, as President of the Associated Students, to clarify an 
issue which has caused qUite a bit of controversy for no apparent 
reason. I am refering to the resignation of AS Vice President-
Administrative Ariel Anguiano. Ariel claims to have resigned to protest 
against the AS's persistent efforts to prevent alternative views from 
being expressed. Specifically, he refers to the fact that the AS Council 
rejected his recommendation to appoint Sergio Chavez, a member of 
MEChA, as the student at large to the Alternative Media Referendum 
Development Committee. 

This committee was created by the AS Council over a month ago to 
write a referendum question to be put on the spring general election 
ballot, asking students about alternative media funding options. Ariel 
was responsible (0 recommendd a student at large to the AS Council 
for an appointment. He did three weeks late, after the committee had 
already begun to meet. Another student at large, Barry Harris has been 
attending these meetings and was hoping to get the formal 
appointment. He was a friend of a council member and a strong. 
supporter of althernative media. When Ariel recommended another 
individual , Sergio, who had not been attending these committee 
meetings a number of issues were discussed: 

1) Why hadn't Sergio shown interest in the committee by 
attending its meetings? Had Ariel told him that the committee had 
begun to meet? 
2) Why 'had Ariel chosen Sergio over Barry, who had been 
partic ipating? 
3) Could the committee fi nish its work with the addition of a new 
member when their deadline was only 2 weeks away? 
4) Why had Ariel been irresponsible in waiting three weeks to 
make this appointment? 

The council did not reJuse the appointment oJSerglO Chavez because they 
didn 't want an alternative viewpoint, but rather because they wanted the 
committee (0 finish its work and write the referendum. It was not a 
question between twO individuals: one Chicano and one Caucasian, 
but between two individuals: one who had demonstrated interest by 
attending the meetings and one who hadn't! The vote would have ' 
been the reverse had Ariel recommended Barry, and Sergio had been 
attending the meetings. 

I wish to clarify this fact, because it seems that the whole issue has 
been transformed into an accusation that the AS Council is blatently 
disregarding different views, being racist and seeking the demise of 
the alternative media. This is simply not true! The AS CouncH has 
never been in favor of getting rid of the alternative media, we are not 
raCIst, and we do not disregard differing views. 

Yes we did endorse a proposal by Michael Fahlbusch, 
Commissioner of Communication, to curb the funding of alternative 
media to a more responsible and equitable process, but we have never 
expressed a desire (0 discontinue funding the media. It is my personal 
view, and that of many others on the council that the alternative media 
should be supported but not necessarily by allocating $52,800.00 of 
student money in a disproportionate manner. If the students want 
alternative media, then we should allow any paper to publish and 
receive an equitable allocation of funds. If a paper has a strong 
readership and wants (0 publish more often , then it should be able to 
solicit advertisement revenues. 

Lastly, I would like to mention that Ariel agreed with the above logic . 
He was in favor of the "Fahlbusch Proposal" from its inception and in 
[act contributed to its preparation and timing. In this sense, the AS 
Council has not denied alternative views any more than Ariel himself 
supported . The AS Council believes in the expression of diverse ideas 
and is committed to representing all students on campus. We are 
interested in hearing what each of you have to say, be it "mainstream" 
or "alternative." 

The AS Council meets on Wednesdays at 6:30 in the North 
Conference Room in the Student Center. Feel free to join us. 

Sincerely, 
Mary Rose Alexander 
President, Associated Students
