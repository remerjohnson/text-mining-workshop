Students fight in support 
of dismissed lecturer 

Atterton's contract not renewed 
due to budgetary constraints 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

Senior Staff writer 

Though UC officials have yet 
to estimate the magnitude of per-
sonnel reductions caused by the 
state's budget problems and ensu-
ing funding cuts, a rou of stu-
dents already 
plans to protest 
the likely dis-
missal of phi -
losophy lectur-
er Peter 
Atterton. 

In response 
to the philoso-
phy depart-
ment's decision 

Courtey 01 UCSD

not to renew Has served as 
Atterton's con- philosophy 
tract, four of ledurer from 
his students 2002 to 2004. 
have begun planning a "show of 
force" to convey their discontent. 
They plan to circulate a petition 
and take their case all the way up 
to Senior Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs David Miller. 

"If that doesn't get us anything, 
we're prepared to do whatever [is] 

necessary to get this done 
whether that means a rally or 
whether it means to tarnish the 
image of the department," said 
Kevin Lewis, a John Muir College 
junior. Lewis is currently one of 
Atterton's students. 

After learning that Atterton 
would not return, Lewis contacted 
deparunent and university admin-
istrators, steps he says have been 
fruitless. During this process, how-
ever, he joined three other students 
working on the same goal, 
Thurgood Marshall College junior 
Lindsay Salk, Revelle College 
sophomore Deborah Dossick and 
Earl Warren ColI.ege senior Jarrod 
Hyam. 

All four said they believe 
Atterton's termination i part of a 
university trend to shift focus away 
from social scholarship to a sci-
ence-based approach to research . 
The students call Attertop "incred-
ible" and "brilliant."

A.S. Council meeting disrupted 
Unidentified individuals douse council 

By GAELLE FAURE 
News Editor 

John Muir College senior 
Bryan Barton led a group of 
approximately 20 individuals who 
threw water balloons and squirted 
water from Super oakers at 
council members during public 
input of the May 5 A.s. Counci l 
meeting. 

Barton came up to the podium 
alone during the public comment 
period, introducing himself a the 
founder of the Philosophy Forum, 
and explaining that he'd "been 
doing a lot of philosophizing 
about student governments." 

"A lot of people have told me 
that A.S. doe n't serve them well," 
Barton aid to the councilmem-
bers. "A lot of people have told me 
that the A.S. could be better 
served by a goat." .. 

At this point, an unidentified 
woman entered Price Center 
Ballroom, where A.S. meetings 
are held, followed by a goat held 
on a leash. Barton continued by 
saying that he was naming the 
goat his co-counsel and taking 
over the A.S . Council. 
Meanwhile, about 20 other indi-
viduals with covered faces holding 
water guns and balloons posi-

A.S. Council

$6,800 to

The A.S. Council approved the 
reallocation of S6,800 from cultur-
al programming and national com-
petitions travel unallocated 
accounts to the Triton Taxi service 
for spring quarter during its May 5 
meeting. The service's costs for 
spring quarter are expected to be

"Already, students depended 
on this program," A.S. 
Commissioner of tudent 
Services Kian Maleki said . "It's 
one of the best services out there 
and it's our responsibility to 
accommodate everyone." 

Triton Taxi, which is the "safe 
ride home" service, provided by 
A.S., was facing a deficit of about 
$9,600 for costs incurred during 
fall and winter quarter. According

Jacobs School co--sponsors 
Homeland Security forum 

ByUSAMAK 
Senior Staff Writer 

A San Diego policy forum co-
sponsored by the UCSD Jacobs 
School of Engineering was held 
on May 3 at La Jol\a Hyatt 
Regency Aventine. The forum 
featured academic and corporate 
leaders. John Kubricky, director of 
the Office of Systems Engineering 
and Development in the U.S. 
Department of Homeland 
Security, was the keynote speaker. 

Kubricky described the infra-
structure and daily operations of 
the Department of Homeland 
Security in his speech. In its first 
year of operation, the department 
has involved the work of 22 agen-
cies and about 180,000 employ-
ees, including the top scientists 
and engineers of the nation, 
according to Kubricky. 

"With the creation of the 
Department of Homeland 
Security, President Bush envi-
sioned an organization that 
engaged entrepreneurs and 
tapped Americans' spirit and expe-
rience in science and technology 
in the war on terror," Kubricky 
said. "It's the expertise of indus-
tries, universities and our national 
labs that will make it possible to ... 
produce the counter-measures 

needed to protect the nation from 
major threats from terrorism." 

Kubricky highlighted the vari-
ous technological mechanisms 
used to improve safety in air, land, 
sea and cyberspace. For example, 
biometric technology is current ly 
being used in 115 airports and 14 
seaports, and air monitoring for 
biological agents takes place in 3 I 
U.S. cities, according to Kubricky. 

Kubricky also stated that the 
department allocated over 58 bil -
lion in overall security funding 
since March 1,2003, representing 
a 900-percent increase in federal 
funding of direct homeland ecu-
rity grams. 

According to Edward Furtek, 
UCSD associate vice chancellor 
for government and COnllTIuruty 
relations, UCSD and San Diego 
State University began collabo-
rating with local legislators and 
groups shortly after Sept. II, 
200 I, to explore possible respons-
es to security threats. 

"We realized that while San 
Diego brings considerable ... intel-
lectual and fiscal resources to our 
nation's war against terrorism, 
many of these same aspects ... also 
make San Diego an attractive tar-
get," Furtek said. "Fortunately,

UCSD researchers discover 
Igenetic time bombl 

Researchers at the School of Medicine have 
discovered a genetic abnormality that can 
cause heart failure or sudden death later in life. 
The condition, general~ manifested throug!1 
heart malformations, is currently treated WIth 
surgery. The study, published in the April 30 
issue of Cell, shows that surgery does not fIX 
the underlying molecular triggers that cause 
heart failure. 

According to medical professor Kenneth 
Chien, the study's senior author, the defect 
causes the heart to gradually fail and can 
sometimes resuk in prOblems with the heart's 
electrical system, causing sudden death. The 
condition could affect patients with forms of 
heart disease other than heart malfonnation as 
well. 

CSU teaching assistants to 
vote on potential strike 
The union representing teaching assistants 

at Califomia State University campuses 
announced May 5 that its members wiU VQ(e 
whether or not to strike. The strike would be 
held in response to what the California Alliance 
of Academic Student Employees/United Auto 
Worio:.ers union calls the CSU system's refusal to 
recognize the union as the official representa-
tive of over 6,000 teaching assistants, graduate 

assista~ts, Mors and graaers througfiout the 
university system. 

The Califomia Public Employment Relations 
Board verified on March 16 that a majority of 
CSU academic student em~oyees have ch0-
sen CMSE/UAW as their Union. Currently, UAW 
daims that CSU officials refuse to recognize or 
bargain with the union. 

lJAW represents over 20,000 academic stu-
dent employees in the nation, including more 
than 11,000 throughout the University of 
Califomia.

getary catastrophe" that has left 
her with no choice. 

The department hired 
Attenon on a one-year contract in 
the 2002-03 academic year, 
according to Churchland, but she 
was able to find enough funds to 
extend the contract for the 2004-
2005 year. But after Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's mid-year bud-
get cuts, and the prospect of more 
on the way, the money to add yet 
another year is just not there, she 
said. 

"If [ had a way of finding the 
money, we'd have a very different 
situation," she said, pointing out 
that the entire department has felt 
the pinch. Faculty members have 
not received cost-of-living wage 
adjustments for several years and 
are working with much leaner 
research budgets. 

Because Attenon was the only 
member of the department work-
ing on a single-year contract, it's 
his position that is being elimi-
nated, Churchland said. 

Though they say they under-
stand the financial situation, the 
fOllr students believe the universi-
ty is unfairly singling out 
Atterton, who they argue is better 
at instructing undergraduates than 
some tenured members of the fac-
ulty. 

"We're at a research institu-
tion, so the professors who ean 
really lecture are a valuable 
resource, and that's why we're so 
adamant about wanting him to 

come back next year," Dossick 
said. wit's partially selfish - our 
education is going to be impover-
ished if he doesn't come back." 

A graduate from the University 
of Essex in England, Atterton 
taught at San Diego State 
University and University of San 
Diego from 1995 to 2002, when 
he came to UCSD. In addition to 
philosophy, he has instructed sec-
tions in Eleanor Roosevelt 
College's Making of the Modern 
World series and Revelle's human-
i ties courses. 

In the ZOO3 edition of Course 
and Professor Evaluations, stu-
dents praised his -enthusiasm and 
intelligence. 

For three out of four philoso-
phy classes included in the publi-
cation, every srudent who com-
pleted an evaluation recommend-
ed Atterton. Though other pro-
fessors received 100-percent rec-
ommendations as well, some in 
the department scored as low as 
67 percent. 

Editors of C.A.P.E. also 
noted that three out of 21 stu-
dents who completed evalua-
tions from a fourth class he 
taught in winter 2003 called 
Atterton the "best professor at 
UCSD." A total of 98 percent of 
the students from the class rec-
ommended him. 

"He's pretty incredible," Salk 
said. "If you've ever sat in at any 
of his classes, he's just so animat-
ed and so brilliant, beyond mea-
sure." 

Student input about teaching 
quality is valuable, Churchland 
said, but she claimed her hand has 
been forced by the reality of the 
budget. 

In November, Schwarzenegger 
asked the university system to 
make 547.2 million in unallocated 
reductions for 2004-05, according 
to an impact report from the UC 
Office of the President. In addi-
tion, the governor's new budget 
proposal, revealed in January, calls 
for an extra 5-percent cut in 
spending on faculty. A finalized 
version of the plan is due to come 
out later in May. 

While in recent negotiations 
Schwarzenegger may have sug-
gested lowering the number to 3 
percent, it's too early to assess the 
actual impact on future faculty 
spending, according to Margaret 
F. Pryatel, assistant vice chancellor 
of resource management. Some 
sort of reductions will be unavoid-
able, she said. 

wWe have a list of cuts that are 
on the table that are not going 
away," Pryatel said. 

Atterton understands that the 
decision to let him go was a ques-
tion of money, he said, and added 
that he does not believe he was 
singled out. 

Though he has an offer to 
teach fWO sections in ERC's pro-
gram, Atterron said he will likely 
nor be able to return next fall 
because the salary would be insuf-

Speech final event in Cesar 
Chavez month at UCSD 

By DEENA AL SHAm 
Senior Staff Writer 

Author Gary Soto spoke at 
UCSD as the final event in the 
month-long Cesar Chavez celebra-
tion on May 3. Soto's talk was 
sponsored by the Thurgood 
Marshall Institute, the Department 
of Literature, the Cesar Chavez 
Committee, the Center for 
Humanities and the California 
Culture Program. 

As a poet, novclist, short story 
writer and playwright, Soto writes 
for all ages. Earlier in the day, he 
spoke to a group of sixth-, seventh-
and eighth-graders at Preuss 
School. 

Born and raised in Fresno, 
Calif., SOto has set most of his 
work in the place he describes as 
"not exactly Hell .. . bur you can 
see it from there." He described all 
of his literature as having a very 
local feeling, since he knows the 
places where these stories took 
place. 

"I had [a story] set in Japan; I 
had no business writing about 
that," Soto said. 

When asked about his contribu-
tion to Chicano literature, Soto 
mentioned three of his novels, 
"Nickel and Dime," "Poetry 
Lover" and "Amnesia in a 
Republican County," which all fea-
tured a fictional Chicano poet, 
Silver Mendez, as the protagonist. 

" [Silver Mendez) is the only 
poet who never grew up, and he

Black studies program 
needed at UCSD 

Six UC campuses have it. UCSD does not. What 
is it? 

A black studies program. 
UCSD boasts of being 

ranked at the top of the UC 
system for its academic 
strengths, on par with UC 
Berkeley and UCLA. 
However, a black studies 
program is sorely lackin~ 
andlong overdue. This can t 
be chalked up to a lack of 
student interest; the Black 

tudent Union has long 
been working on starting 
such a program at UCSD, 
and the A.S. Council and 
Thurgood Marshall College 
Student Council passed res-
olutions in support of a black 
studies program. These res-
olution ca n be used to 
ach ieve a realistic goal. 

While budget cuts may 
make departments re luctant 
to launcn such a F rogram at 
this time, the fact is that 
many current courses could 
be incorporated into a black 
sruJ ies minor. The only 
snags are in drafting the pro-
gram and pushing It through 
the bureaucracy. But With 
the zeal of supportive stu-
dents, the support of inter-
ested professors and swift-
ness on the part of the 
Academic Senate, a black 

studies minor is not only 
possible, but a probability. 
Some day, it could even 
evolve into a major, as it has 
at most other UCs. 

While a black studies 
minor would provide UCSD 
undergraduates with a great 
academic opportunity, the 
program would also help 
attract black students to 
UCSD. Our campus cur-
rently enrolls the lowest per-
centaKe of black students of 
all UC campuses - just 1 
percent. Students rallied 
against low black enrollment 
in March, and made various 
demands of the administra-
tion to help boost these 
numbers. Out of all their 
demands, a black studies 
program i the most likely to 
be implemented. 

But this is about more 
than offering more majors 
or increasing the enrollment 
of one ethnicity. It's about 
recogrUzing the accomplish-
ments of the black commu-
nity and its role in American 
history and culture. UCSD 
must close gaps in knowl-
edge, and encourage all 
involved in this process -
students, staff and faculty 
alike - to work together to 
implement this important 
program. 

Resident shuffle part 
of larger problem 

T his fall, residents at every college except 
Earl Warren and Sixth 

will be housed at colleges 
other than their home col-
lege. This move will further 
fragment the student popu-
lanon and continue to erode 
any college affiliation 
beyond general education 
requirements at UCSD. 
This resident shuffle is 
endemic of a larger problem 
with the college system. • 

The ASUCSD structure 
- recently analyzed by an 
A.S. task force - consists of 
college-based representa-
tion. This does not make 
sense when students' affilia-
tion with their college exists 
primarily becuase oT where 
they are housed during their 
time on campus. If this trend 
continues, die A.S. Council's 
structure must be altered to 
reflect reality at UCSD: For 
the most part, if you do not 

live in a college'S housing 
complex, you 00 not feel 
connected to the college. 

How can this disconnect 
between representation and 
reality be addressed? 

One option is to prioritize 
housing students, especially 
freshmen, at their home col-
lege. This has proven diffi-
cult, as college deans make 
efforts to guarantee on-cam-
pus housing to as many stu-
oents as possible. 

The other option is to 
examine the representation 
of student government. 
Senators claim to "repre-
sent" students at their home 
college, even though most 
have long ago lost any sense 
of affiliation with it. The 
A.S. Council should explore 
all-camJ>us representation 
that reflects the true makeup 
of the student population -
which is seldoinly linked to 
college affiliation.

Student government gone bad 
A.S. slighted DJs in dance preparations 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Staff Writer 

Perhaps once or twice during 
the entirety of the school year at 
UCSD, some students actually get 
off their collective asses and decide 
to organize a massive event for the 
benefit of their fellow students. 
"Fusion," the gargantuan hip-hop 
dance competition run by student 
groups MASA and 220, is a perfect 
example of what happens when 
this goes right. The multitude of 
A.S.-sponsored concerts and 
dances, including the abysmally 
attended and altogether useless 
College Night at the Pub, pretty 
much represent the other side of 
things. The three quarterly music 
festivals, including the drunken 
orgy of Sun God, are a notable 
exception, but seeing as most of 
their annual budget goes to make 
these concerts, the A.S. Council 
had better damn well make sure 
these festivals are a success. 

The DJ5 and Vinylphiles Club 
on campus is actively trying to 
change this trend. It doesn't have 
nearly as many resources as the 
AS. Councilor MASAI220 to put 
on its own event, but the club did 
its best to help the AS. all-ampus 
spring dance on April 2 avoid the 
Curse of Failing AS. Events. In a 
landmark partnership, the DYC 
helped Associated Students pr0-
mote the event and used the 
opportunity to set up I spec:tICIIIar 

show with five DJs (all UCSD 
alumni), . representing five major 
genres of electronic music. 

Everything seemed to be going 
fine until the day of the event. 
Sure, there was the small matter 
that Associated Students would 
not pay these independent DJs for 
their services. but the club said it 
was OK with paying for these DJs 
(some travelling all the way from 
Los Angeles) to come and do the 
event, as long as Associated 
Students would feature the DYC 
in advertising. Seemed fair 
enough, and both had a nice verbal 
agreement. 

A word of the wise to any stu-
dent organization at UCSD: 
Never, ever, ever, make an agree-
ment with the AS. CoWlcil with-
out getting it in writing. Why? 
Because the AS. Council went 
back on its agreement, leaving the 
DVC out of the one huge adver-
tisement that mattered. the cloth 
Price Center banners. You'd think 
with all of the effort the AS. 
Council goes to with silly Price 
Center banners to get members 
elected, it would realize that these 
publicity devices might also be 
important to a student organiza-
tion bending over backwards to 
malce sure an AS. Council event 
doesn't fall prey to the Curse of 
Failins AS. Evatt!. 

But these gripes are puny com-
pared to the clay of the event itlelf. 
In modler verbeI apeement lODe 

awry, the A.S. Council decided to 
move the hip-bop half of the 
dance out of the Price Center 
courtyard and inside Price Center 
Ballroom (where the DYC DJs 
were supposed to be) because of a 
"60-percent chance of rain.~ So, 
after helping out with the event 
for free, the DVC was completely 
kicked out, with no ' chance of 
compromise. 

Even the Price Center tech 
crew wanted to split the ballroom 
up and give the DYC a smaller 
room so that UCSD students still 
could have a choice of music, but 
the AS. Council was unrepentant. 
According to the council, another 
stage would cut the crowd capaci-
ty by 250 people and they might 
have to turn people away. So, 
based on a chance of rain (it didn't 
rain), and the chance that a few 
more people would be turned 
away (after forcing an event with 
estimated 4,000 attendance into a 
tiny ballroom with a capacity of 
1,(00), the A.S. Council destroyed 
the only decent thing it had going 
for it at yet another failed event. 
And with all this raIk of "splitting 
up the ballroom" and "reduced 
capacity," none of the people in 
charge thought to share the main 
stage to at least give the DYC 
some token time for its efforts u a 
gesture of goodwill. 

But, apart &om these gripes

Danger lurks behind the squares Dve: A.S. should have let 
DJ club share the stage 

indecent 
exposure 
Marianne Madden 

People pick up the GUllTdiJm for two reasons: to hunt for mistakes and inaccuracies, 
and to do the crossword puzzle. 

Until recently, I didn't under-
stand all the fuss about the cross-
word puzzle. J was content to pick 
up the paper, laugh at the mistakes 
and inaccuracies J found, and then 
take it home to line my cat'S litter 
box, leave it in a lecture hall when 
no one was looIcing, or strew it over 
the nearest sidewalk. 1 enjoyed the 
occasional game of Scrabble much 
more than the average person, but 
the crossword puzzle? Nab. 

That all changed one day when 
I found myself in biology class, hav-
ing browsed the paper all the way to 
page 16 without spotting any nUs-
speUed photo captions or uproari-
ous grammatical errors. The cross-
word taunted me, its blank squares 
seeming to wink lasciviously. 

So, like a l4-year-old trying her 
first bong hit, I tried it. "It's what all 
the cool kids are doing," I assured 
myself, glancing around at my 
classmates, who were all hunched 
over the same puzzle, ignoring the 
lecturer at the front of the room. "It 
can~ do any hann - I'm just trying 
it once." 

The clues beckoned - so sim-
ple, but so complex. Was a four-let-
ter word for "a large nwnber of" 
toIlS, lots. or gobs? Which "occa-
sion to use good china" did the puz-
zle want from me? And who the 
hell composed "Over the 
Rainbow"? I get high off the 5\IC-
cesa of filling in half the clues on an 
initial pass, but was haWlted by the 
duel I didn't immediately know. 
On the bus, walking to class, eating 
lunch - I clutched my puuJe, 
sweaty fingers smearing the ink, 
poring over the defiant clues, going 
over and over potential answers in 

my head. Completing all of it was 
damned near impossible. I felt like a 
failure for not knowing the name of 
Nigeria's currency or the capital of 
Bulgaria: But worst of all, I knew I 
was hooked. 

Casually fiUing in clues during 
class was cool; it made me look hip, 
rebellious and knowledgeable. But 
doing online crossword puzzles in 
the evenings, with no one but me to 
admire my success' Well, that was 
jnst pathetic, even if doing puzzles 
in Flash was quicker and neater 
than scribbling on newsprint. But, I 
painfully reminded myself, the 
point was not to finish the puzzle. 
Oh no. The point was to be forever 
working on the puzzle, thoughtful-
ly penciling neat block letters in the 
view of as many people as possible. 
It's not socially acceptable for adults 
to do other word games, like the 
Jwnble. But crosswords? Why, if 
you do a crossword, you must be 
literate, learned and clever. And if 
you do them while you should be 
doing something else? Ob-ho-ho, 
we've got ourse1ves a winner! 

Like any addict, I found I had to 
increase my stakes to attain the 
same buzz: I started filling in the 
puzzles in ink. Soon I was caught in 
a destructive cycle of depression, 
despair and messy cross-outs. I 
became esttanged &om my &miIy 
after calling them just to asle, 
"What's the last name of 'Chicago 
singer Peter'?" I would wake up in 
alleys, bruised and dirty, half-fin-
ished crossword puztles draped 
over my face. I began hoarding 
pens, paranoid that I would be 
caught without a ' writing imple-
ment when the answer to a due 
came to me. I needed help. 

I told myselfI'd been earmarked 
for addiction since birth, for word 
game-mania runs in my family. I 
have terrible memories of waiting 
up to the comics, only to see - day 
after day - the page brutally fold-
ed beck to give my mother easy 
access to the crossword. The puuJe 
was always completed by the time I 
woke up - a clear sign of my 
mother's terrible, terrible battle 
with addiction. 

At such a numbers- and mcts-
oriented universitY, it seems curious 
that, when faced ~th a blank cross-
word puzzle, UCSD students sud-
denly appear to gain such an appre-
ciation for wordplay. Bur, at a more 
basic level, our infatuation with 
crosswords is easily explained. 

Doing crosswords, like hanging 
out in coffee shops while wearing 
trendy eyeglasses, is all about 
image. And Southern Californian 
college students are obsessed with 
image. Having a head crammed full 
with random knowledge is, in itself, 
useless. But channeling that ran-
dom knowledge toward crossword 
puzzles' It's validatingl It's brilliant l 
And best of all, it'll keep you from 
ever having to interact with the per-
son sitting nen to you in class! 

Secondly, the basic priorities of 
college students are as follows: 
food, sleep, hedonism, "Simpsons" 
trivia and the avoidance of study-
ing. Crosswords are a great way to 
avoid studying and - should you 
find yourself in a lecture by some 
terrible accident - an easy way to 
avoid being tainted by the knowl-
edge of professors and lecturers. 
And crosswords even include die 
occasional "Simpsons" -related clue. 

After having gotten my own 
crossword puzzle addiction some-
what under control, and being able 
to objectively analyze the situation, 
the truth is clear: Crossword puz-
zles are a threat to all we hold dear 
as Americans and as college stu-
dents. One minute you're an inno-
cent kid idly working on the Jwnble 
on a SWlday afternoon; the next 
minute you're in college, furiously 
filling in crosswords - avoiding 
what you should be doing, like hav-
ing lots of casual sex and drinking 
Wltil you forget your name. 

Crossword puzzles brealc lives. 
They break families. And they will 
break you. too, unless you resist 
them with all your force. Now 
would you please give me I four-
letter word for "Swan lady"?

continued from page 4 
with the way Associated Students 
runs its events, there is a bigger 
problem here, and a greater issue at 
stake. The fundamental purpose of 
Associated Students is to take 
UCSD students' money and spend 
it to positively impact UCSD stu-
dents. Yet, at least for the last cou-
ple of years, it seems that the pur-
pose of Associated Students has 
been to take UCSD students' 
money and spend it on whatever 
the AS. Council would like to do. 
This presents a slight problem if 
Associated Students is supposed to 
represent the UCSD student body. 

Most of this trouble comes hom 
the fact that most UCSD students 
couldn't care less about all-campus 
dances or anything else that the 
A.S. Council puts on, and ignore 
the A.S. Council completely, so 
there's quite a bit of guesswork 
involved in finding out what stu-
dents would like. To its merit, the 
AS. Council has done a reasonable 
job in gauging student interest. 
However, the council screwed up 
royally with the all-campus dance. 
What better way to represent the 
interest of a wide variety of stu-
dents than to turn away a group of 
students and alumni who were try-
ing to make your own event appeal 
to a larger group? 

UCSD students like alternative 
music. The large groups of people 
at KSDT and the DVC are proof 
of that. The AS. Council, on the 
other hand, doesn't know a thing 
about DJs, as evidenced by the 
spectacular failure of its own DJs at 
College Night. Funhermore, the 
AS. Council is unable to see past 
its own beliefs, so the DVC had to 
take action. Or, in the words of 
event coordinator Michael 
Dawson at an AS. Council meet-
ing: "I had to make a decision and 
that decision was to play top 40 
stuff in the ballroom. So, the DVC 
has filed a Judicial Board case 
against me." 

That Judicial Board case was a 

textbook example of why, again, all 
organizations should get their 
agreements in writing, or bener 
yet, avoid the A.S. Council alto-
gether. The DVC, undersrandably 
irked that it was completely thrown 
out of its own event and trying to 
get little more than a formal apolo-
gy (in the form of a Gum'dian 
advertisement), had the book 
thrown at them by A.S. 
Commissioner of Smdcnr 
Advocacy Jeff Boyd. You read that 
right. UCSD's official ftluJl'1lt advo-
cate was defending the A.S. 
Council and attacking its own con-
stituency, reducing the DVC mem-
bers to little more than blubbering 
balls of misery. 

With all respect to Boyd's con-
siderable skills as a litigator, it was a 
completely inappropriate way to 
treat a student organization whose 
only crime was to seek formal 
recognition for being kicked out of 
its own event. During the closing 
statements, when Boyd's litigious 
yelling had calmed down, both 
groups expressed interest in work-
ing things out amiably and contin-
uing DVC~ longstanding tradition 
of friendly cooperation with the 
A.S. Council. So, why did Boyd feel 
the need to militantly destroy the 
DVC' 

A far more interesting question 
is: Why, when he was being so 
arduously defended, did Dawson 
make an even Poorer showing than 
the DYC, readily admitting that he 
was making poor and uninformed 
decisions with regards to the plan-
ning of the dance because he was 
unable to keep the event under 
control? 

Despite these CritiCIsmS, 
Dawson should be congratulated 
for his success at the all-campus 
dance, and his work toward dis-
couraging student involvement in 
student-funded events. After all, 
the fewer people who show up, and 
the fewer independent groups 
involved, the easier it is to manage 
events like this. 

Be a Leader in the Army National Guard, and get the respect of soldiers who will look to you 
for leadership. You'll also get career training, money for college and opportunities to develop 
management skills - plus special training to prepare you for advanced positions. Most Guard 
members train part-time, so they're ready to respond if their community or the Nation needs them. 

If you have at least 60 college credits and meet other requirements, you can apply to 
Officer Candidate School. The Guard offers flexible Officer programs that can help 
you stay in school or let you work full-time.

Barton himself threw nothing.

the goat, yelling, "The coup is a 
failure ... the coup failed, I'm 
sorry." 

Some councilmembers laughed 
and as Iced Barton to leave the 
goat. A few councilmembers who 
left the ballroom in the ensuing 
confusion retaliated at Barton 
with stray waterballoons and a 
bowl of salad, at which point 
Barton was called aside by campus 
police officers. A.S . Adviser 
Lauren Weiner had called UCSD 
Police on her cell phone during 
the water fight. 

Officer Scott Gustafson said 
that he offered to place Barton 
under citizen's arrest if any coun-
cilmembers wamed to malce a com-
plaim, but none did so, and he was 
let go after questioning. 

said Daniel Gonzales, Student 
Affirmative Action Committee rep-
resentative to A.S. "I'm in favor of 
people coming to call us out and 
challenge us to be better, but that 
kind of intimidation really both-
ered me." 

Gonzales added that he felt that 
this could deligitimatize the A.S. 
Council when they go to the table 
with the administration. 

"They're goinS to have this in 
the back of their heads, so that even 
if we're doing something really 
concrete like asking for Triton Taxi 
to go online. they're going to see 
this as us not having legitimacy 
with students," he said. 

According to A.S. 
Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Jeff Boyd, the reports 
filled our by wimesses will be doc-
umented and sent to the Muir 
dean. If the maner isn't resolved 
between Barron and the dean 
informally, it will go to a formal 
hearing. 

continwd from fltICt .J 
mentioned Chicano writers such 
Richard Rodriguez. He said his 
own memoir, caUed "Living Up 
the Street," was a reaction to 
Rodriguez's book "Hunger of 
Memory." 

"I decided to write my own 
version of what it was like to 
grow up Mexican-American," he 
said. "I began to get fan letters, 
and I had never gotten fan letters 
before." 

Soto cited "Jesse" as his 
favorite novel. He set it during the 
late 19605 and 19705 farm work-
ers' movement and described it as 
a "prominent struggle." 

A member of the California 
Rural Legal Assistance and the 
United Farm Workers of 
America, Soto emphasized the 
need for a legal arm for the farm 
worlcers. 

"To this day. we still need 
lawyers, people who are oversee-
ing that landlords and growers 
obey the law." Soto said. 

In addition to discussions of his 
role in Chicano culture, SOtO read 

excerpts from some of his 20 
books and fielded questions from 
the audience about his writing. 

After graduating from high 
school with a 1.6 grade point aver-
age, Soto went to a junior college 
where be became immersed in the 
works of different American poets, 
motivating him to make a career 

" The act of writing keeps you on the edge ... you 
just have to keep writing. 
I'm scared of not writing."

in the field. 
Soto doesn't write in Spanish, 

saying he would "destroy the 
Spanish language" if he did. Yet 
Soto said he still brings his Latino 
roots and his childhood experi-
ences in Fresno into his writing, in 

his poetry and novels like "The 
Afterlife." 

Asked about advice to over-
come writer's block, Soto said to 
just keep writing. 

"The act of writing keeps you 
on the edge ... you just have to 
keep writing," he said. "I'm scared 
of not writing." 

Communication professor 
Michael Schudson, who attended 
the event, was among those who 
helped bring Soto to campus. 

"It was great fun for me to -
bring • writer I have enjoyed and 
admired to UCSD and introduce 
some of my colleagues and stu-
dents to, and find that there were 
so many other fans around," 
Schudson said. 

About 90 people attended 
Soto's talk, which Schudson said 
was about the size audience he had 
hoped for. 

"I was very excited to hear Mr. 
Soto speak," graduate student 
Ashley Lucas said. "I've been a f2n 
of his work for a lo,!g time, and it 
was great that they could bring 
him here to campus." Barton claimed that the individ-

uals covering their faces did not 
come in with him. 
"Perhaps my words roused the 
people into chaos," he said, adding 
that he thought most of the A.S. 
Council was fine with the "coup," 
but not the administration. "The 
universiry doesn't lmow how to 
have fun - they want to stifle all 
student activi ty." 

Boyd said he didn't lcnow what 
charges could result ftom Barton's 
actions, adding that it could be a 
tricL:y case because Barron himself 
did not launch any waterballoons 
or squirt any water onto coun-
cilmembers. 

Ledurer: Atterton scored high on C.A.P.E. 

A.S. PresidentJenn Pae said the 
whole event was "sort of a blur." 

"It was quite interesting," she 
said. "As long as no one got hurt ... 
well, there are really no words to 
describe it." 

Other councilmembers said 
they found the display disrespectful 
and "ridiculous." 

"People literally felt unsafe," 

"We don't have any established 
guidelines for this, because as far as 
I mow, we haven't seen anything 
remotely like this," Boyd said. 

Barron, who is editor-in-chief of 
Tht Koala, is a graduating senior. 

"I thought it was a pretty good 
joice," Boyd said, adding that it 
would be a nice tradition, except 
perhaps without wasting that much 
water. "If people remember that 
we're all just srudents here ... five 
years down the road, it's not really 
going to maner."

While he said he is moved by 
the support of his students, he nei-
ther encouraged their actions nor 
condoned them. 

"I'm touched by th.eir support 
but I don't want to give the 
impression that they'll be success-
ful, because they probably won't 
be," he said. "It's simply a bud-
getary question." 

The students admit that their 
chances are "slim," but they say 

they are fighting for a larger princi-
ple: the responsibility of the univer-
sity to provide undergraduate stu-
dents with quality education and 
take their considerations into 
account. 

"The fact is, if we want some-
thing done, we have to prove to 
[administrators) that we have 
some sort of power over them, be 
it in the form of a rally or in the 
form of spreading the word that 
this is what the department did," 
Lewis said. "Because one thing 

they care about is the image of the 
department and the prestige of the 
university and, if that startS falling, 
that's when they might care about 
it." 

Church/and said even a mass 
appeal would probably not suc-
ceed in getting Atterton baclc. 

"My decision is constrained 
by money, and there is simply no 
money," she said. "Even if there 
are 20,000 names on the peti-
tion, I don't lrnow where I'll find 
it."

Washington funding, doing major 
innovative work, which then trans-
lated ... into commercial develop-
ment," Preuss said. "I think we are 
all very eager to learn much more 
in the future and hope that our 
community and our country are 
producing the systems and the pe0-
ple to keep us safe." 

Several Preuss School students 
also attended the event. 

"I had no idea UCSD was so 
federally active," Son/ong Nguyen, 
a Preuss School sophomore, said. 
"Normally you just think that 
you're just going to school to learn, 
but you're researching how to pro-
tect the world, and that's kind of 
scary, from my point of view." 

Other cosponsors of the event 
included the Woodrow Wilson 
International Center for S"holar 
and the San Diego Regional 
Network for Homeland Security. 

Taxi: Vasant projects $3,200 needed in 
additional funding for spring quarter 

continutd from page J 
spring qllarter are due to an unex-
pected increase in the number of 
students using the service. The A.S. 
Council had originally allocated 
$ 12 ,000 to the Triton Taxi in the 
beginning of the year. 

"We had made the promise to 
provide Triton Taxi to all the stu-
dentsL!9 ~~ bave \JI~ resP9nsibility 
because the service is being used so 
much," Vasant said. 

According to Vasant, all the 
money for cultural programming 
has already been allocated and 
there will still be available funds 
left in the national competitions 
account. 

Vasant said during a May 5 
finance committee meeting that ' 
the allocation was vital in order to 
keep the service going. According 
to Vasant, while Associated 
Students has yet to receive a bill 
from Cloud 9, the shuttle company 
it's contracted with to provide the 
service, the allocation would help 
in avoiding deficit spending. 

"We haven't been billed yet, so 
right now, it is deficit spending, 
which means that we have zero 
money on our account for Triton 
Taxi and we are still running the 
service," Vasant said. "We can't do 
that. There has to be money in that 
account before we stan spending 

any money." 
John Muir College Interim 

Freshman Senator Nam Bui told 
members of the finance committee 
during the meeting that reallocat-

" We had made ~ promise 
to provide Triton Taxi to 
all the students, so we 
have the respansibility 
bealuse the service is 
berng used so much."

ing funds from the National 
Competitions Travel account 
would still leave $2,000 for student 
organizations requesting funding 
in the upcoming weeks. Bui added 
that organizations have a four-week 
threshold to ask for funding before 
it can be added as new business on 
the A.S. agenda. 

"Basically, given the time right 
now up until the last week, which is 
our last meeting, there's no way [an 
organization) can fall under that," 

Bui said. "Even though we can 
probably make exceptions, we do 
have money for two more alloca-
tions of about $1,500, in case 
someone does come in. That's a 
pretty strong safety net. " 

Vasant also said during the 
finance meeting thlt there is still a 
need to come up with the $3,200 to 

. meet the projected c;osts for spring 
quarter. Vasant said diat she is hop-
ing A.S. Council will allocate 
Triton Taxi $35 ,000 for next year. 

"We're going to have to find 
more money," Va~ said. "I think. 
Triton Taxi is one of the things that 
students recognize Associated 
Students for. Students are taking 
advantage of [the service] and I 
hope that the new A.S. Council will 
make it apriority." 

Maleki said that he will be ana-
lyzing the number of average miles 
that students use the service and 
how much the service will cost 
nen year. He said that he is also 
considering sponsorship and 
whether to continue the contract 
with Cloud 9 or choose another 
shuttle service. 

"We're looking to be spon-
sored by a private business that 
would benefit from that sponsor-
ship and maybe changing our ser-
vice with different provider," 
Maleki said.

PB Block Party: Drunken 
times and family fun 

• , RICHIE LAURIDSEN 
Staff Writer 

Drunk. en dissoluteness is not the only thing staking its claim on Pacific Beach. 
The 29th annual Pacific Beach 

Block Party will wreak havoc on the 
entirety of the San Diego neigh-
borhood May 8, with attractions 
ranging from musical acts from all 
across the country to showcases of 
local blent. it will also include a 
wide variety of vendors and attrac-
tions throughout the main drag of 
Pacific Beach. 

A major San Diego event, this 
year's party will be located on 
Gamet Avenue from Ingraham 
Street to Mission Blvd. 

The free event provides enter-
tainment that spans all age groups; 
multiple outdoor Sbges and a bar-
rage of musical talent lay claim to 
this year's concen schedule posted 
on the event's Web site, 
http;//1UIUIII.PIJhIoc*pmy.cum. 

"Seven Sbges wiU be set up out-
side," said Kevin HeUman, a coor-
dinator for the block party. 
HeUman said that he estimates over 
65 bands will play, including the 
club attractions. 

"Bands are coming from ' aLi 
over," HeUman said. "It staned as a 
very local community street fair, 
but has extended to include nation-
al artists.» 

National notables include blues 
prodigy 'Joe Bonamossa, who was 
discovered as a teenager by B.B. 
King and has blossomed into a 
blues guitar expert. Bonamossa wiU 
play the Jazz 88 sbge, while B-Side 
Players will perfonn an unplugged 
set at the 91 X stage. 

The festival, oriented around 
the community, ' also celebrates 
local talent. Local heroes Louis 
XIV will unleash their brand of 
garage rock, while other talent 
spans from the up and coming pro-
gressive rock sensibility of Scarlet 

Symphony to the quiedy honed 
pop sentiments of Reeve Oliver. 

Aside from all the sonic sur-
roundings, the block parry cele-
brates a whole new side of local tal-
ents. According to the event's Web 
site, "Over 400 booths of unique 
arts and crafts, inventions, corpo-
rate sponsors and virtually every-
thing else 'unde! the sun'» can be 
seen at the party. 

This includes a Kid's Corner, 
with family entertainment and an 
NBA Jam Van that will be parked 
throughout the party. 

"At aU times there's something 
to do,» Hellman said. 

The party has drawn over 
7 5 ,000 people in the past according 
to Hellman, and exists to truly 
serve the community. Profits in the 
past have gone to the Pacific Beach 
Town Council, Discover PB, 
Kiwanis, PB Rotary and the 
Mission Bay Youth Association. 

"Donations are usually 
matched by the organization, so it 
guarantees that they'll be con-
tributing to the community," 
Hellman said. Organizations like 
the Pacific Beach Town Council 
and Discover PB have already 
received donations from this 
year's event, and have used this 
money to promote extra police 
protection on the day of the block 
party. 

Other Pacific Beach organiza-
tions have used their money to 
funher programs for youth base-
baU and develop community out-
reach. 

Much of the committee that 
puts the event together has been 
working together on the block 
party for over 15 years. Some have 
even been a pan ofltbe staff for all 
29 years, said Hellman. \ 

"We work to make it safe, 
something for the community," 
HeUman said. "[t's a fun, friendly 
event. Hopefully there's some nice 
sunshine." 

THE UCSD OUARDIAN HIATUS 9 

Art exhibit 'Redefines Yellow America' 
Asian-American artists break down nerdy engineer stereotypes 

By SARAH MAl( 
Senior Staff Writer 

The electrical engineer, the bio engineer and the math major are all stereotypes that are 
placed upon the Asian-American 
student at UCSD. But wait, 
what's that? An Asian-American 
artist? Isn't that unheard of? 
M archall senior Stude nt 
Stephanie Liu would beg to dif-
fer. Two years ago, Liu, an I-Cam 
major, and her roommate were 
sitting in her kitchen discussing 
the lack: of recognition Asian-
American artists received and felt 
the need to speak out on behalf 
of her Asian-American artist 
peers. The idea of "Redefining 
Yellow America" was born. 

Tired of the lack of Asian-
American an represented in the 
media, "Redefining Yellow 
America," an art and music festi-
val presented by the Chinese 
Studies Student Organization, 
strives to break down these 
stereotypes by introducing stu-
dents to the creativity Asian-
American artists at UCSD and 

the greater San Diego area have 
to offer . 

Running from May 3 to May 
7 on Library Walk, the second 
annual festival will feature an 
eclectic collection of artwork and 
media including short films, 
music and photography. T he fes-
tival's mission operates to not 
only break down stereotypes , but 
to al 0 show that Asian-American 
art does not simply comprise of 
kung-fu flicks and anime. Most 
importantly, the festival is an 
opportunity for local Asian-
American artists to present thei r 
artwork [Q the UCSD popula-
tion'. 

After the success of last year's 
festival, the organizers have man-
aged to put together a festival fea -
turing the works of L.A.-based 
artist Christina Wong and San 
Diego painters Tanya Ta and 
Berenice Limon. 

For music buffs and audio-
philes, bands such as hip-hop 
group Dialect!: Crew, Butterfly 
Edge and UCSD singer/song-
writer lIa will perform at this 
year's festival. Listening booths 

featuring music and spoken art 
touching on subjects such as 
fetishisising Asians and ethnic 
pride, by Philadelphia duo 
Yellow Rage, will al 0 be set up 
throughout the day. 

T he intentions of such an 
event is to help rai e awareness 
among the comm uni ty and 
proves to be va luable. Organizer 
Liu admits this is one of th e 
hardest things she's ever done in 
her Ii fe. Liu stresses that he' 
not looking to "completely 
change people's views, but JUSt 
simply get them thinki ng." The 
event is a celebration of the cre-
ativity that is often overlooked in 
the Asian-American community 
and overshadowed by miscon-
strued labels. 

Forget about the "dragon 
lady," the Suzie Wongs and the 
Bruce Lees; yes, there are Asians 
out there who happen to be good 
at math, but, as this festival will 
prove, there are also the Asians 
out there who play a large role in 
the San Diego art community -
many of whom can be found at 
UCSD.

Humor and warm moments 
ligbt up Icelandic film 

By CUFFOID HILO 
Staff \\\'iter 

The film "Noi A1binoi" opens with shots of forbidding vistas of 
a cotton-white ijord, chilling in 

the way its angular snow-capped 
mountains jut out of the screen like 
threatening knives. But in the peren-
nially wintry township of the inlet, 
people spend their mornings shovel-
ing piles of snow from their door-
ways and then, aherwards, doing not 
much else. Given this boredom, it's 
no wonder that the albino s1acker-
hero, Noi, would rather hole himself 
up in his grandmother's cubby-hole 
basement than go to school. 
However, underneath the unwel-
coming landscapes and tiresome 
livelihood of the Icelandic inhabi-
tants, there's a wann undercurrent of 
comedy and sensitivity that salvages 
"Noi" from its cold and depressing 
exterior. 

The story revolves around Noi 
and an interesting cast of characters: 
his quirky, cake-balring grandmoth-
er; his alcoholic, c1oset-maoke-lov-
ing father; and his sweetish girl-
friend, Iris, among others. He 
weaves close to these characters, 
offering them his quiet charm, his 
wry, incisive wit, and above aJl, his 
shared understanding for small -town 
frustration. Yet, when hes alone, he's 
rigging slot machines for malt liquor 
money, sending off shotgun blasts at 
ice floes, or flipping lazily through 
images of exotica in a child's 3-D 
viewfinder. Jaded as he is, he can't 
bring himself to run away. 

Hovering in close proximity with 
Noi's bouts against the stifling claus-
trophobia of his troubling social and 
domestic life, the film expertly tem-
pers cheerless events with two types 

Film 
REVIEW 

of humor - topical and understated. 
In the first half of the film, the for-
mer kicles in when Noi's French 
teacher attempts to maintain the 
consistency of mayonnaise, or when 
Noi fumbles with a vat of pig's blood, 
soaking his father and grandmother 
crimson head-to-toe. In the second 
half, the film charges into a series of 
relentless heartbreak. But what's 
great is that the comedy is still there, 
just more subtle and bleak, as 
demollSU'ated in an absurd sequence 
where Noi and a pastor compromise 
on how deep Noi should dig a grave. 

Also in "Noi," serving as a kind 
of buffer for the desperate tragedy 
and even the comedy, is the pleas-
ant attention paid to Noi and Iris' 
romance, his father's devotion to 
music, and the peculiar, unassum-
ing grandmother. It is as though 
director Dagur Kari conjured these 
poignant moments directly from 
his own Icelandic youth . 

Although "Noi" later plunges 
into a profound sadness, the 
restrained laughter and kindness of 
both the film and the characters give 
a hopeful, rosy blush to that over-
cOIning, frost-ridden fjord . Plus, it's 
just really fun to say UFjord!"

'Van Helsing' lacks monster bite 
ByVUMAI 
Staff Writer 

As the trailer seemed to promise, "Van Helsing" really is nothing more than a pretty 
bad film. The obscure lines, hokey 
Transylvanian accents and lack of 
any resemblance to a comprehen-
sible plot will leave viewers irritat-
ingly confused. 

The film starts out with blacle-
and-white scenes of Doctor 
Frankenstein in his laboratory 
working on his well known "mon-
ster." Electricity's flying every-
where, lightning's flashing allover 
the place, when suddenly Count 
Dracula (Richard Roxbough) 
appears by the monster's bedside. 
Audiences will ask, "Wait, why is 
Dracula hanging out in Doctor 
Frankenstein's laboratory?" 

A year later, Hugh laclcman is 
introduced as Mr. Gabriel Van 
Helsing, the underground assassin 
of evil hired by a secret high-
ordered priesthood running out of 

the Vatican. He receives a mission 
to run over to Transylvania to van-
quish Count Dracula. Before you 
know it, Wolf Man enters the plot 
out of nowhere, and suddenly the 
film cuts to a scene with Count 
Dracula running mysterious were-
wolf science experiments. The 
movie is pretty much downhill 
from there. It's over a quatter into 
the film and viewers still don't quite 
understand what the hell's going 
on. 

Never will so many people in 
the theater turn to their neighbors 
with sadly perplexed looks to ask 
"What just happened?" "Van 
Helsing" takes too long to clarify 
the connection between the over-
load in side stories working 
throughout the film. In the end, 
there is little time to deliver a com-
prehensible explanation. This 
leaves the storyline weak, confusing 
and in a black hole somewhere 
between the plot of Nintendo's 
"Casrlevania" and "The Matrix 
Revolutions. " 

Film 
REVIEW 

If bland is the plot, cheesy is the 
acting. Roxbough's rendition of 
Count Dracula was comparable to 
the guy who dresses up as the vam-
pire at U niversaJ SlUdio's monster 
revue show. And though Kate 
Beclcinsale is pretty hot as the 
Transylvanian princess, Anna 
Valerious, her tasteless accent 
makes it hard to concentrate on any 
aspect of her acting. 

As for Jackman, however, he 
should receive credit for his perfor-
mance. He excels at entertaining 
the audience with his charming 
humor while managing to make 
vampire slaying seem easy. 
Unfortunately, the expected sexual 
chemistry between Jackman and 
Beckinsale is nonexistent and audi-
ences will feel more excited with 
the chemistry between Van Helsing 
and Carl the mar (David Wenham). 

The movie has its moments; it 
ha s its entertaining special 
effects, nice clean CG work and 
enough humor relief to make you 
chuckle once or twice. However, 
the bottom line is "Van Helsing" 
is a poorly executed fi lm . 
T hough it sits on a clever idea, 
this film will make even "Blade 
II " eem like a richly accom-
plished film.

BIOBEHAVIORAl TREATMENT OF 
ANXIETY & FEAR 

Why computer-assisted treatment? 
From time to time, everyone feels anxiny or flar. 
The feeling often is appropriate. Occasionally, people 
suffer from inappropriau anxiety or fear; even wor!(, 
they may do so on a persistent or r(current basis. It 
may take the form of worrying about everything, or 
obsessive thoughts. or compulsive rituals, or phobias, 
or post-traumatic strain, or reaction to a lifo evmt. 

Virtually End .... Opportunltl. -

The acknowledged "gold standard" of ueatment for inappropriate anxiety 
or fear is biobehavioral. Biobehavioral treatment combines biological science 
{medication, only when necessary} with behavioral science. Until recently, 
comprehensive, biobehavioral treatment has been too laborious, demanding, 
and expensive for clinicians ro provide regularly on an outpatient basis. 
The computer now makes the impossible possible. 

The computer allows for a step-by-step, systematic, consistent, easy-co-use, 
affordable, biobehavioral format. It provides education about anxiery and 
fear and how best to relieve them. It offers an interactive platforfl.l by 
which to apply that information personally and individually. It enables data-
entry that automatically documents the course of treatment in the form of 
a graph - an acrual picture of progress. These computerized functions 
assist in fulfilling therapeutic goals and enriching the therapeutic experience. 

think What EduadIoIIaI Technology Can Do For Youl 
~~Ir"-Are you an English major? Biology 

major? A social worker? A mom? A 
computer scientist? These are some 
of the very people who have 
combined their backgrounds with 
Educat.ional Technology to create 
amazing careers.

Computer-assisted, biobehavioral treatment obviates the commonplace

broke the II -second barrier in 
me 100 men's dash, crOSSiJlg the 
finish line in a time of 10.99 sec-
onds. 

Maybeno's time was good 
enough to win section four in me 
meet and also to place him at the 
third-best all-time position in the 
school records. 

Senior Julian Nahan finished 
second in the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase with a time of 
9:23.82. 

Sophomore Mike 
Cunningham had a personal 
record in the 110 hurdles with a 
time of 14.6S , further improving 
his qualifying time for Nationals 
and placed him at the second-best 
all-time position at UCSD. 

On the women's side, freshman 
Elisa Holiday captured the sec-
ond-fastest time in UCSD history, 

clocking in with a time of 12.03 in 
the 100 meters. 

"Holiday had a big personal 
record in the 100 at 12 .03," 
Salerno said. "That should get her 
into Nationals and is just .02 off 
the school record ." 

Senior Clara Wilson regis-
tered an NCAA provisional time 
in the 4OO-meter hurdles with 
her time of 1:03.03. 

Junior Lindsay Stalker also 
gave a solid performance in the 
1,500 with her time of 4:42 .16, 
which placed her time as the 
sixth-best on the school record 
list. 

Senior Sagrario Hernandez 
finished third place in the shot-
put with her throw of 14.S6 
meters, the second-longest 
throw for a Division II athlete 
mis year. 

With roughly a week until the 
CCM Championships, the team 
has been focusing on competing, 
rather than training. 

"If all goes well, both teams 
should be in the top three in the 
CCAA Championship meet," 
Salerno said. "The women have a

meet." 

The Steve Scott Invitational 
was the last meet prior to the 
CCAA Championships for the 
Tritons, which will take place on 
May 14 and May 15. 

"Our Division IT 
varsity four had its 
beSt row to date on 
May I, leading the 
race for 1,800 mete rs, when 
Western Washington pulled 
through mem, to beat them by 
about a lengm," PinkertOn said. 

The boat had 
sophomore 
Ariana Pilram as

senio r Tess Kornfield as stroke, 
along ,vim senior Alexis KJeckner, 
junior Liz Record and senior 
Chelsea Smim.

Baseball: UCSD to face Seawolves in opening round 
coruinued from page 16 

home run by catcher Mike Amezcua 
in the top of the fifth inning, and the 
Tritons answered with a solo home 
run of their own in the sixth by 
junior first baseman Brian Robinson 
to make it a 5-2 game. The blast was 
Robinson's first as a Triton in his first 
year in the program. 

UCSD added three insurance 
runs, with two in the seventh inning 
on RBI singles by Burton and Riddle 
and one in the eighth on freshman 
catcher David Moreheadll second 
coUegiate home run. 

Pinocchio, BuTton and 
Robinson had two hits apiece for 
UCSD among its total 12 hits and 
Pinocchio and Robinson each 
scored twice. Riddle finished with 
two RBI to increase his team-lead-
ing total on the season to 55. He 
drove in eight runs in the series, 
and was the hero of the May 1 
come-from-behind victory with a 
two-run home run in the top of the 
eighth inning. 

"ibe seniors on this team are 
very special," O'Brien said. "They 
have grown with the program and 
have been through some tough 
times. And while I'm proud of their 
perfonnances this weekend, rm cer-
tainly not surprised. If you look 

closely at our seniors, you quiclcly 
realize why this team is good. I 
couldn't be happier for thern." 

The emergence of Robinson 
and Burton played a critical role in 
gening UCSD into the CCAA 
Championship. Since working his 

" Determination, 
combined with our 

senior leadership and 
veteran play, was 

the key to our 
success. " 

way into t:he lineup in the eighth 
spot in game two It San Fnncisco 
State on April 17, Robinson has 
gone 14-for-29 (.483) with two 
doubles, one triple, one home run, 
five RBI and seven runs scored, 
moving up to fifth in the batting 
order for the May 2 clincher. Five 
of the last six games have seen him 

provide multiple hits. 
Burton has been even hotter. 

Since returning to the starting 
lineup from injury, Burton is hit-
ting .500 (26- for-52), with seven 
doubles, two triples, a home run, 
13 RBI, 12 runs scored and two 
steals. Now batting in the two 
hole, he has collected multiple 
hits in 10 of the last 13 games, 
including eight straight games. 
Burton had a string of seven 
games in a row in which he had at 
least one extra -base hit. 

The May 2 victory was UCSDs 
34th of 2004, a new school record . 
The 1994 team, which finished third 
at the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Division III College 
World Series with O'Brien as cap-
tain, posted 33 wins. The Tritons are 
now 34-22 overall, finishing in the 
CCAA with a 22-18 record. Cal 
State Stanislaus concluded its season 
at 20-35-1 overall, 10-29-1 in CCM 
play. 

'The double-elimination tourna-
ment in San Bernardino, Calif., will 
open with No. 4-seeded UCSD 
squaring off against CCAA champi-
ons and top-seeded Sonoma Sate at 
3 p.rn. on May 5. The Tritons took a 
series against the Seawolves, 3 -I, 
earlier in the 2004 season.

win right away - just play good 
tennis," Steidlmayer said. 

The Tritons increased their 
intensity in singles and did not fal -
ter against the Vulcans. Continuing 
their confident play and solid exe-
cution of shots, UCSD toolt the 
first set in all six singles matches 
and that all but nailed the coffin for 
Hawaii-Hilo. 

Chopn, who had been sidelined 
with an injury, finished his match 
first with a convincing 6-2, 6-0 win 
against Korneclt at No. I singles. 
Chopra II aggressive play and solid 
service kept Komeck £rom gaining 
any momentum. 

"I was nervous in singles 
because I hadn't played a match in a 
while," Chopn said. "Ever since I 
gdt back from my injury, I was not 
very confident, but aher the first 

couple of games, I started hitting 
the ball well. I just steamrolJed him 
aher that." 

Chopn's win put UCSD at 4-0. 
At this point, three Tritons had the 
opportunity to clinch the dual 
match. Swatt was up S-4 in the sec-
ond set, and in the court next to 
him was junior Emil NovaIc. up 5-3 
in the second. Wilson was also up 
5-0 in his match. 

Swan ended up clinching the 
victory for UCSD when he held 
the serve to win his singles match, 
6-2, 6-4. Because UCSD already 
won the match, Wilson, Novak. 
Molden and Monon did not con-
clude their singles matches and 
UCSD took the 5-0 victory. 

"It was exciting to win the 
clincher," Swatt said. "I was jok-
ing around with Emil [Novak] 
about who was going to finish 

first . " 
'The Tritons are set to play in the 
N~ Round of 16 of the National 
Championships Festival in Orlando, 
Fla., beld from May II through May 
16. UCSD will play West Florida, 
ranked second in the nation. The 
specific date and time of the match is 
yet to be detennined. 

Since entering Division n, the 
Tritons have only played West 
Florida once, and lost, 7 -2, in the 
2003 season. However, UCSD is 
confident about its chances against 
the Argonauts. 

"The key is going to be doubles. 
If we can get [at least] 2 out of 3, 
we're going to have a good chance 
at winning. I feel like it's a winnable 
match," Steidlmayer said. "I think 
the guys are confident that they can 
win. West Florida is not too good 
for us, they're just a good team."

CCAA Playoff berth

Tritons make first postseason 
appearance since move to D-II 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Triton baseball team com-
pleted it~ four-game serie against 
Cal tate Stanislaus on May 2 with 
an -3 victory over the Warriors. 

CSD also won the first and third 
games as well, 1+-4 and 9-7, respec-

tiv~y, but dropped game two, 6-5. 
The Triton victories were 

enough to propel them over the an 
Francisco State Gators in the 

alifornia Collegiate thletic 
sociation conference standings. 

Thu, C D will participate in the 
po tsea on for the first time ince the 
team' move to Divi ion U in 2000. 

"If you think about it, we've been 
in the postseason for weeks already," 

o head coach Dan O 'Brien 
aid. "We've been facing must-win 
ituation again t good team and 

have found a way to get it done. This 
team is ready." 

In the fourth game, Triton senior 
pitcher Raf Bergstrom went the dis-
tance and threw the complete nine 
innings, earning the win for UCSD. 
Bergstrom allowed ix hits with 
three runs, all earned, and two walks 
while striking out a pair. lIe 
improved to 5-6 with hi third com-
plete game of the eason. Fittingly, 
he made the final out of the game on 
a ground ball he fielded and threw to 
senior Keith Albrecht at first base. 

"Detennination, combined with 

our senior leadership and veteran 
play, was the key to our success," 
O 'Brien said. 

UCSD struck immediately for 
three runs before Bergstrom even 
tepped on the mound. Junior sec-

ond baseman Ricky Pinocchio dou-
bled to lead things off and moved to 
third on senior centerfielder and 
Triton Player of the Week Brett 
Burton's infield single. After junior 
hortstop Keith IIernandez's walk 

loaded the ba es, senior designated 
hitter and co-captain Jeff Riddle 
drove in the game's fir t run with a 
ground ball while reaching ba e on 
an error. Burton came home on a 
double-play ground ball, with junior 
leftfielder Joel Clark providing a 
clutch two-out single through the 
right side of the infield to bring 
Hernandez around. 

"We have so much depth offen-
sively and defensively on thi team," 
Albrecht aid. "Everyone can tep in 
and get the job done." 

O 'Brien agreed that his team has 
pulled together at this very cru ial 
point in the ason. 

"The right hitters got hot at 
t he right time," O'Brien aid. 
" Ironica lly, those hitters were 
[largely] seniors who knew thei r 
sea on wa on the line."

Track and field team 
anticipates top pefonnances 
By MICHAEL SCHOECK 

Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men 's and 
women 's trac k and field teams 
ga rne red a number of solid per-
formances in their final meet 
prior to the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championships. They competed 
against their top opponents in the 
high temperatures at the Steve 
Scott Invitational hosted by UC 

Irvine on May 2. 
"It was a long, hot day, and that 

really hurt most of the perfor-
mances in the field events and 
races longer than 200 meters," 
UCSD head coach Tony Salerno 
said. 

Nonetheless, a number of long 
distance runners maintained their 
edge, including senior Neil Kalra, 
who secured the 5,000-meter

UCSD makes NCAA Championships 
Men's tennis ousts Hawaii-Hila in five sets 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Sports Editor 

UCSD men's tennis head 
coach Eric Steidlmayer told his 
team to simply have fun, execute 
their shots, and play with confi-
dence before their regional play-
off match against Hawaii-Hilo. 

The No. J 3 Tritons did just 
that and defeated Hawaii-Hilo, 5-
0, at the Northvicw Tennis Courts 
on May 4. The victory advanced 
them to the NCAA National 
Championships for the first time 
since UCSD's jump to Division [J 
in 2000. 

UCSD (J -9 overall) was orig-
inally scheduled to participate in 
its playoff match in Hawaii, but 
the withdrawal of top-seed 
IIawaii Pacific from the tourna-
ment due to two ineligible players 
forced a reseeding of the tourna-
ment. The withdrawal meant the 
Tritons would play Hawaii-Hilo 
(13- 12 overall) at home instead of 
BYU-Hawaii. 

"I thought we had a good 
chance to win because we beat 
[Hawaii-Hilo] twice before," 
Steidlmayer said. "But I also knew 
[Hawaii-Hilo] could play well 
becau e it was [a clo e match] last 
time." 

T he Tritons, who had a five-
match winning streak to end the 
season, continued thei r so lid 
play with·an aggre ive tart at 
doubles. eniors ameer Chopra 
and Jeff Wil on 
began the dou-
bles sweep

As Morton 
and Molden finished, 

senjor Amir Nejad and junior 
Bryan Swatt were up 6-5 in a tight 
match against Karl and Staffan 
Moritz for No.2 doubles. 

"We started off a little slow," 
Swatt said. "We were not making 

as many shots as we usuaUy do and 
that's our strength. But we 
became more aggres ive at the 
end." 

Their aggressive play and 
clutch shots paid off, and Swan 
and Nejad broke serve to win the 
match, 8-5. 

UCSD roUed into 
singles with a 3-0 

cushion and only needed two sin-
gles victories to eliminate the 
Vulcans.

Golf in second after two days at Regionals 
Dolby, Scheer, and Duckworth in top-10 for final day 

ByIOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team compet-
ed in the NCAA Division U Men's 
West Regional golf tournament, 
which took place at the 
Bellingham Country Club in 
Bellingham, Wash., from May 3 
through May 5. Results available 
at press time only include the first 
two rounds, with the Tritons plac-
ing second. 

The UCSD golf team is no 
stranger to thjs course, having 
placed second in its first tourna-
ment of the 2003-04 season at 
Bellingham. The par for the 
course is 72, with four rounds 
being played each day by each 
team for a total par of 288. For 
each day, only the top four scores 
from each team are used for com-

puting the score. The par for the 
two days plafed thus far is 576 for 
two rounds .. > 

The THtons started off the 
tournament with a solid round on 
May 3, shooting a 284. This was 
only one above the lowest score of 
the day, shot by the only team 
from Washington, Western 
Washington University. Only one 
of the four UCSD golfers whose 
score counted for the team's over-
all total shot over par. 

On May 4, the Tritons had 
another solid round, shooting 291. 
Going into May 5 play, the golf 
squad had a score of I-under-par 
575, one of its best scores to date. 

Except for UCSD, the 
leaderboard fluctuated on May 3 
and May 4. Chico State, who was 
in third place after the May 3 
round, with a 287, came back on 

May 4 to shoot a 281. It held a 7-
stroke lead over UCSD and a 
solid command of first place as 
of press time. 

Cal State Starnslau!, whose 
288 on May 3 put it in fourth 
place, was able to shoot a 289 on 
May 4, to put it in a tie for third 
place with a score of I-over-par 
577. 

St. Martin's College, which 
was sixth after a 293 on May 3, 
stepped it up to tum in a 284 on 
May 4, giving it a 577 as weU and 
a tie for third place. 

After the May 3 round, 
Western Washington was in first, 
with a score of283, but shot a 295 
on May 4, to give it a 578. It was 
in fifth place as of press time.
