No New Taxes 

Mayor: 
by Mark Stadler 

News EdItor 
Mayor Wilson called Wednesday 

for holding down city taxes in 1976 
to make San Diego more attractive 
for new business and to battle " the 
twin, antithetical national con-
cerns of inflation and unem-
ployment. " 

Although these problems are 
national in origin Wilson said, they 
can be eased by city policies. A 
discussion of those topics was the 
major thrust of Wilson's 40 minute, 
low-key State of the City address. 

"1976 will be a year of austere 
and hard decisions" for the City 
Council, Wilson said. The hardest 
of those decisions, to the Mayor, 
will be balancing the city budget 
without a tax increase. 

To do that will require "further 
cuts in the ('City) employee work 
force," he said. "We have no 
choice." 

But the restraint on government 
spending will be necessary, Wilson 
s:tid, because it will "produce a tax 
climate attractive to business and... 
industry" and thus bring the jobs 
necessary to ease the city's 11.3 
percent unemployment rate. 

Wilson said that public service 
jobs are not the answer to the 
unemployment problem. The 
programs were originally intended 
as "stop-gap" measures, the 
Mayor said, but as they become 
permanent they divert from 
private business "capital and 
labor" when it is required "for 
private investment to bring about 
economic recovery." and with it 
"the real and lasting jobs in the 
private sector." 

Wilson said that restraint would 
be the most important factor in 
controlling inflation. He cited as an 
example the labor disputes m the 
past year, and called forth labor 
and management to exercise 
restraint in both wage demands 

"Both parties had better bear in address also touched on: There will be no increase in cost of living index to be applied to

He said that if the drivers had 
chosen to strike for further benefits 
they would have ended bus service 
in San Diego permanently. 

(Early Wednesday morning the 
bus drivers overwhelmingly ac-
cepted a new pact which could hike 
their hourly wages to over $9.50 an 
hour in three years.)

Bus Drivers Accept New 
Transit Contract 

City bus drivers overwhelmingly accepted a new three year contract 
early Wednesday morning that could raise their wages from the present 
$7.65 an hour to $9.67 an hour by 1979. 

By a 354-38 margin the members of the Bus Drivers Union Local 1309 
accepted the pact that will make them the highest paid bus drivers iil the 
nation. The pact ended the threat of a strike by 600 San Diego bus drivers. 

The wage negotiations have sharply divided city officials, with reaction 
primarily negative from Mayor Wilson and the City Council, which urged 
the San Diego Transit Corp. to hold steady on salary increases. 

Dlsa'greement on Wages 
Before the new contract, drivers earned an average of $18,392 a year, 

including overtime and holiday pay, transit corp. officials said. 
However, David Moore, the union president, said that the average is 
closer to $15,000. 

The new pact gives no hourly raises but instead quarterly cost-of-living 
pay hikes. Moore said that the first cost-of-living raise, due in February, 
will add about 14.5 cents an hour. . . 

The contract is practically the same as the previously rejected by union 
members because it included a 20 cent per hour raise in the last two years 
of the contract. 

Moore said that reaction from Wilson and the City Council had nothing 
to do with the union's acceptance of the agreement. 

- " The COC proposal would cause 
the most accelerated fee increase 
pattern." 
- " The proposal would cause un-
certainty from year to year as to 
the cost of the student's 
education. " 
- " There would be no incentive to 
ca r efully evaluate present 
programs (funded by the reg fee) 
since funding would be insured." 
- " A system wide increase may 
result in several surpluses on some 
campuses. This may cause these 
campuses to spend the surpluses 
on programs and buildings, which 
are not needed on the campuses." 
- "The formula may put students 
in an adversary relationship with 
the employees paid from the 
registration fee . Tying fee in-
creases directly to salary in-
creases could cause serious con-
flicts between students and em-
ployees." 

The Student Lobby cited student 
opposition to the proposed in-
creases as major reasons fOl 
decision of Saxon not to raise the 
fee. 

An Interview With Mallory Mitchell 

UCSD Basketball Player Who Knows He Can Make the Pros 
UC San Diego 's varsity 

basketball team will open the 
conference season at home 
tomorrow night against Cal 
Baptist, and the Tritons will 
depend on Mallory Mitchell to 
pro vide much of the 
firepower. 

A 6'1", 180 pound senior 
guard, Mitchell currently leads 
his team in every offensive 
category, including scoring 
average , assists , and 
rebounds. 

At his curre"t pace, he will 
break six UCSD season and 
career records, by the con-
clusion of the season. Mitchell 
now is in the NAIA top five in 
nearly every offensive 
category. 

His coach, Barry Cun-
ningham, says, "I believe Mal 
is the best guard in this 
school's history. He's always 
"ad the physical talent, and 
the mental attitude, and this 
year he leads the entire team 
by example. I've given him the 
green light, and he's free to do 
whatever he thinks is 
necessary on the court. It's 
really been Q pleasure coaching 
Mal. " 

Triton Times sports editor 
Dave Eisf!n interviewed 
Mitdwll. and got his feelings 
on sub;'cts from playing 
professio"1I1~ to the future of 
the 1975-76 Tritoru.

eVin Hog.n, •• yea'! 

Mitchell : There is really no 
pressure on me personally, but I 
do want to finish my senior year 
as successfully as possible. I am 
the team leader, both on the court 
and off the court, more because 
I'm Mallory Mitchell than a 
senior. 
T1': Have your four years of 
basketball made you a better, 
more disciplined player? 
Mitchell : In my junior and senior 
years, I have been much more 
disciplined than my first two 
years. Last year I became kind of 
a playmaker, and this year I'm 
called on to do everything. It's a 
challenge. 
T1': Do you mind that challenge? 
Mitchell : Not at all- in fact I 
enjoy it. 
T1': How has your game changed 
this year from last? 
Mitchell : We had some great 
scorers last year, like George 
calhoun , Paul Trainer, Steve 
Kircher, and Joe Coit, so my job 
was just to set them up for 
baskets. They were also taller, so 
I didn't have to worry about 
rebounding. This year I have to 
use a more balanced game, 
scoring, defense, rebounding and 
passing mf, if our team is going to 
win. 
'IT: AI OppOllellD look .t UlSD 
&l1li year. "., do tbey • the 

team's strong points? 
Mitchell : I think a lot of them 
figure, if you stop Mitchell, 
you've stopped UCSD. To a point , 
that's true. I don't think I'll be 
stopped, though, because if they 
stop my scoring, I can pass more 
and let others score. I can con-
centrate on defense , or 
rebounding. 
T1': Several players have been 
named ineligible this year. Gary 
Nash, your starting center, and 
Lee Brockett, were just two. 
What effect does that have on tbe 
team? 
Mitchell : It has a pretty bad 
effect on most of the players, 
because sometimes we don't 
know who will be on the team 
from one day to the next, for 
whatever reason. 
T1': How do the players who left 
compare with tbose on other 
teama, talent-wise? 
Mitchell : We still have more 
talent than any team in the 
league, with the possible ex-
ception of Cal Baptist. 
T1': How about USIU? 
Mitchell: I don't think they rank 
with us. They beat us early in the 
season because they had a whole 
starting team returning and we 
had a lot m new players. As far as 
overall talent goes, we have more 
than them now. 

T1': Have you thought about 
playing professjonally? 
Mitchell : I've thought about it 
seriously for a number of years. I 
feel that I'm mentally and 
physically capable of playing 
pros, but I know that only a select

Oh My Goodness. It's Mondo 
ondage from the Tubes 

san Francisco's bondage rock 
group, The Tubes, will perform 
this Sunday, Monday and Tuesday 
at the La Paloma Theatre in 
Encinitas. A mutational offspring 
of the 50s grass-roots rush to 
allergy-free Arizona, The Tubes 
migrated from Phoenix to San 
Francisco a few years ago. In 1972 
they became the Bay Area's 
premien! outrageous theme band. 

The Tubes staged the first 
Streakers Ball, which admitted all 
naked people free, and invented 
bondage rock with their leather 
and chains production number, 
"Mondo Bondage." Their Win-
terland Halloween show turned 
into a riot when the band 
premiered its underground classic, 
"White Punks ori Dope. " 

Showtimes are 8 and 10:30 pm 
Sunday and Monday, and 8 pm for 
Tuesday.

JaDIIUy 11, 11'11 

by Edward Simons 

Bora Lava, Private Eye 
The office smelled like three old women. 1be coffee was stale, my 

cigarette tasted like parathion and I had a splitting headache. The phone 
ranI!. 

"Borax Lava? The vulgar Bulgar?" 
That's me, toots. Wbatcha want?" 
"I want you to find my dog." 
"Fine. I'll be right over," I said, hanging up. She disgusted me. 
I tried to clean my ears. I followed the doctor's advice, using nothing 

sharper than my elbow. It didn't work. So,I used an old porkchop that 
was lying by the telephone. Next time I'll try someone else's elbow. 

Last night was terrible. I went to some dive on the east side, trying to 
contact the wife of my client. She missed the appointment, so I got drunk 
instead. Now I had a hangover. I'd have to shower in kerosene to get the 
stink of that place out of my clothes. 

My client, to drag you into this, is an investment counselor on The 
Street. Recently, he took a vacation in Santa Cruz. While there, he was 
given some kind of drug and went out of his mind forawbile. In his words, 
he "committed an indiscretion with a beached whale." 

As luck would have it, some guy on the beach happened to have his 
camera handy and recorded my client's acts on film. 

Blackmail, pure and slmple. 
My client had received a letter from the blackmailer who threatened to 

show the photos to my client's wife if he wasn't paid $50,000. My client, 
who is something of a gigolo, couldn't pay and couldn't ask his rich wife. 

That's when I was called in . My client was afraid his wife would 
become jealous and sue him for divorce if she saw the pictures. 

Made perfect sense to me. A hundred a day, plus expenses, confers 
upon one a depth of understanding denied people of lesser intellect. 

Unfortunately for me, it looked like I was going to lose the case. I 
couldn't find the photographer to steal the negatives from. The reason I 
asked my client's wife to meet me in the bar was to compromise her and 
give my client something to use in divorce proceedings. 

Well, I'd lost better cases. 
Time for some new coffee. 1 turned on the bot plate and tried to fill the 

pot. No pressure, damrnit. They'd turned it off. I put some ice into the pot 
Instead. Just to save time, 1 put in my morning hot dog, too. 

The phone rang. It was my client. He's taken a chance and given the 
blackmailer a check. The man would be picking up the check at the 
airport, leaving the negatives. 

Chances were, he'd take the negatives with him after he discovered the 
check, so I was to follow him. 

I had to eat my hot dog luke warm. 
The blackmailer discovered my client's ruse at the airport, but not 

before 1 snapped a couple of shots of him. He left a note giving my client 
48 hours to see the light. 

An old buddy of mine in the department owed me one. He sent the 
picture to the FBI and the CIA for an lD and an MO. 

"Who is he, Joe?" 
"The FBI didn't have him, Borax, but the CIA did. His name is Jean-

Clod Francois." 
"TheClA?" I asked. "What did he do?" 
"Nothing," Joe said. 
The only thing the CIA had on the guy was that he was a native of the 

small country of Monza, whose chief export is drought. Big help. 
I took Frenchie's picture with me to the street. A big girl named Cin-

namon Ginseng came through. She said Frenchie was living in a run-

down studio on East 59th. Well, lowed ClMamon six. At least. 

It looked like strong arm tactics were in order. I flashed my badge at 
the attendant and got a room next to Frencbie's. He came in about nine. I 
collared him. 

"Usten, Bud. Give me thOle negatives or." 
"Or what?" he sneered. 
"Or this " I said, giving him a fierce tongue lashing with a beef tongue I 

keep in my pocket for the purpose. He gave in. The negs were in the top 
drawer. 

I opened the envelope and held one of the negatives against the light. 
There wasn't a whale in sight. They were state documents, stamped top 
..cret. 

"What the hell?" I gasped. 
"That's right, Lava," came my client's voice behind me. 
I turned quidtly. He was holding a gun on me. 

"What is this?" 
"It's so simple, Lava, that even you could understand it. I stole those 

documents from the U.S. govenunent. This creep here," he said, putting 
two slugs into Frenchie, who fell on my feet, "stole them from me. I 
bought you to get them back. Now, of course, you're of little use." 

I reeled. "But why me?" I asked. 
"Set a sucker to catch a sucker, Lava. Simple, isn't it? Goodbye, sap," 

he said, moving closer. 
I thought fast. 1 made Frencbie move with my foot. 
"Look, he's still alive!" I yelled. It worked; he fell for it. 
Harrison put another slug into Frencbie's stiff body as I threw the 

tongue at Harrison. It hit him in the neck. He got a shot off, but it went 
wide. I was better. I hit him in the shoulder. He spun and dropped his iron. 
I was on him in a flash. Harrison had a glass jaw-one punch and he was 
out like a light. 

The attendant had heard the shots and had come up the stairs. 1 guess 
he hadn't lived in New York long. 

"Call the cops," I said, "and get out." He did. 
I went to Harrison and took my hundred dollars for the day. 
The clock said six-thirty wben I got home the next morning from the 

station. I was cold and hUngry. !thad been a rotten day and a worse night. 
All I wanted was a beer and a hot dog. 

I put some more ice into the coffee pot and turned on the hot plate. 
There was one hot dog left in the freezer. I put it in the pot. 

Five minutes later, nothing. They'd turned the goddammed electricity 
off, too. I probably had some crud in the water company to thank for that. 
I hope he dies dirty, hungry and cold. 

I found a wire coathanger in the refrigerator. I grabbed it and the hot 
dog and 1 trudged downstairs. 

That's where they keep the furnace.

few make it. Attending a school 
like UCSD that doesn't publicize 
its athletes too much doesn't help 
mycbances. 
'IT: Wby did YOIl come to a school 
tbat rarely pllbllclzes Its 
athletes? 
Mitchell: At the time, I didn't 
know. I came strictly for the 
academics first, and sports second. 
I thought the publicity here would 
be good, because I think it is with 
most of the UC schools. 1 just found 
in the past year or so that if you're 
going to get publicity, you're going 
to get it in the Triton Times and 
that's all. The city newspapers 
care mOiStly about USIU, USD, and 
Point Loma, and over the past few 
years we've had better talent. 
They look at UCSD as academics 
and that's it, but we've had some 
tremendous ballplayers here. 
'IT: What do you see in tbe 
basketball future for Mallory 
Mltcbell? 
Mitchell : I think the professional 
recognition can come. I need 
some people in my corner, just 
like all players, in fact all people 
need. I was picked in the hard-
ship draft of tbe NBA two years 
ago, and I talked to K.C. Jones 
(then the coach of the San Diego 
Q's) and we decided that two 
more years would help me. I 
know that I can make it on the 
professional level now. 
'IT: What do you see for the team 
tbis season? 
Mitchell : We started off slowly, 
with so many new players, and 
we were in a slump. Now we've 
come around and won four in a 
row. This is 1976, and the slump 
was in 1975. It's a bicentennial 
year, so we're going to have a 
bicentennial for the basketball 
team .... ____ ........
