ecurity is Tight for 
Emperor's Visit to UCSD 

by John H . Taylor 
Editor-in-chief 

Amid the tightest security ever for a vi sitor to U San 
Diego, the Emperor of Japan vi ited cripps I nstitution of 
Oceanography yesterday to view the world-famou s facilit y and 
compare note with two of its most eminent cientists. 

The visit to Scripps by Hiroh ito erved to emphasize " the 
Emperor a a re pee ted dentist" rather than as a head of state, 
according to one participant. 

AlthcJugh there were sur-
prisingly few spectators for the 
three-hour vi It, an e timated 
175 peace officers -- from the 
San Diego Police Department, 
the Sheriff's Department , the 
Highway Patrol , the Univer ity 
of California police and the 
Secret Service -- were stationed 
on the lower campus. 

Members of the Secret 
Service -- identi fied by gold 
emblems on their lapel --
moved through the groups of 
spectators 10 the . vario us 
VIewing areas on the campus. 
Occasionally individual were 

topped and searched . 
In addition, Special Weapons 

and Tactic (SWAT) per onnel 
were in view on Scripp 
rooftop, a Coast Guard cutler 
patrolled back and forth along 
Scripps' horeline and Coast 
Guard and Sherifr s department 
helicopters circled the campus. 

The ecurity was aid to equal 
that afforded a U President. 

Hirohito arrived at Scripps at 
1':20 pm from his uite at La 
Jolla's Sea Lodge, where he had 
lunched with Empres Nagako.

" Would you want to live·

"Would you choose to live in

orby room?" 

These questions, along with 
other alternatives to dorm 

Iivin~, w.ere ·. posed in a 
questionnaire gIven to campus 
re idents last year. 

The survey started as ·a class 
project when several students 
got together and polled resident 
students about their living 
ituation. 
Now the group is working to 

make the most popular alter-
natives a reality. 

The poll got a "better than

Appearing before a large and 
friendly crowd as the opening 
speaker of the Mandeville 
Lecture Series in the gym-
nasium, Gregory spoke on a 
whole gamut of subjects 
ranging from Patty Hearst to 
vegetarianism for over three 
hours. However, the crowd was 
most attentive during Gregory's 
repeated charges of massive 
coverups by the CIA, the FBI 
the Secret Service and some of 
America's leading citizens and 
institutions of a whole assor-
tment of high economic and 
political crimes. 

Exhorted the Audience 
In the course of his speech, 

Gregory again and ag~in 
exhorted the audience to 
become more aware of a whole 
series of related events and 
issues that he claims have 
become the major probleru in 
the history of the Untted States. 

The civil rights activist 
repeatedly sought to link the. 
assassinations of the Kennedys 
and Martin Luther King, the 
Patty Hearst affair, Watergate 
and the recent attempts on 
President Ford's life as part of a 
grand eff rt by persons whom 
Gregory calls, in their capacity 
as national p'owerbrokers, 
"racist pimps," to further 
control the lives of the 
American people. 

Bringing to the forefront 
what are seemingly isolated acts

While the UC Student Body 
President's Council is meeting 
at the UC San Diego student 
center today at lO am to discuss 
the seating of one of its 
membersl,. a debate is on bet-
ween StlPC members over 
whether that body's Operating 
Code allows such an actIOn. 
I."UU\: i:UJUWS sucn an acnon. 

UC Santa Barbara's un-
dergraduate representative, Neil 
Morran, was temporarily 
suspended by the SBPC on 
September 12 by an 8 to 5 vote, 
with two abstentions. This 
action was taken pending an 
SBPC investigation of charges 
brought against Moran by UC's 
Black Student Coordtnating 
Council and the UC Chicano 
Steering Committee. 

Those charges stem from 
campaign violations committed 
by Moran, who is ASUCSB 
External President, during 
UCSB's spring election. Moral, 
along with ASUCSB Internal 
PreSident Howard Robinson, 
failed to report the purchase of 
$3 worth of postage stamps, 
and inaccurately listing those 
stamps on their campajgn 
statement. 

The postal infraction was one 
of six alleged violations brought 
against Moran and Robinson by 
Murv Glass, a UCSB Black 
Student Union member who ran 
against Moran. Moran and 
Robinson admitted to the postal 
violation on June 4 last year. 

Robinson told the UCSB 
Daily Nexus on April 16 that 
"Most of the charges were 
blatantly untrue" and "the rest 
were a waste of paper and our 
time because they were sitnply 
nOt violations of the ElectIon 
By-Laws."

An SBPC subcommittee, 

which included UCSD's Irma 
Munoz held open hearinss at 
UCSB \a t week to investlgate 
the char.ges. Cathy Nelson, 
from UC Santa Cruz, 
representing the subcommittee, 
ha refu ed to comment on the 
ca e. 

Nelson totd the Triton Times 

Wednesday that the SBPC 
might meet in executive session 
when discussing Moran's case. 

Meanwhile, SBPC members 
are divided over whether they 
have any business discussing 
Moran's seating at all. 

Bevan Dufty, UC Berkeley's 
undergrad rej)resentative, feels 
that the SBPC is allowed to 
determine its own membership, 
citing the section of the SBPC's 
Operating code that states, "the 
council shall reserve to itself the 
determinati on of the 

qualification of its members." 
Dufty voted for Moran's 

suspension. 
On the other hand, Jeff 

Sheldon, UC Davis grad 
representative, doesn't think 
that dau e was intended to refer 
to AS Presidents, such a 
Moran . Sheldon, who sees 
Moran's censorship as "a 
politi cal powerplay" to 
discredit Moran at UCSD, 
contends that UCSB students 
should determine Moran's

On Wednesday, Oct. I, 
Robin DeRioux\ a new reporter 
for the Triton Times. was asked 
to leave the Cooperative's 
Steering Committee meeting. 
Since that time there have been 
three articles speaking to the 
issue and numerous public 
inquiries. 

On behalf of the Steering 
Committee, I would like to. 
one. exohun exactly what the 
Steering Committee is. two. 
why a reporter was asked to 
leave, and three. offe; a 
solution . 

First the Steering Committee 
is organized to be an open 

forum for all interested students 
who plan to use the ~oop as a 
voice of the students. In order 
to better facilitate the Monday 
evening meetings of the full 
Coop, future agenda items are 
brought up so that advice can be 
given to an individual as to the 
most ~ffCftive form of 
presentation . 

At times, the Steering 
Committee goes beyond this 
fOTmat. Quite often 
frustrations, anxieties, and 
skepticisms about our ef-
fectiveness are aired. For those 
of us who care enough about 
the Coop and want to see it

ask that the Triton Times agree

We urge Ihe SBPC -- while examining the election procedures of 
their members -- to investigate the election of Li Mandri and 
Munoz. That election WIIS symptomatic of several difficulties, the 
least of which is the leniency with which the Cooperative views its 
rules and procedures -- they are suspendable, or changeable, at Ihe 
slightest whim. 

Parking Area for Campus Latecomers Urged 

But Ihe most pressinl concern, 10 us, is that in this case such 
leniency has caused the election of two officers whose ability to 
represent the undergraduates of UCSD is more than dubious. 

As I approach the Muir 
parking lots daily at ap-

lots are full. Disappoi ntedly, I 
enter. Soon I find myself 
competing for a parking sp~c~.

Students Call for Investigation of Munoz, Li Mandri Election 
The UCSD Studen t 

Cooperative was conceived 
during the summer of 1974. It 
wa an experiment, a model of 
early New England town 
meetings. It was to have 
stimulated st ud ent par-
ticipation . It was to allow all 
interested individuals to 
represent themselves. It worked 
200 years ago. 

The structure of the Coop 
was meant to facilitate direct 
st udent inpu t. Any un -
dergraduate could become a 
member -- no one could be 
excluded. One had on ly to have 
attended the last two out of 
three meetings in order to have 
voting privileges. (This was to 
IIl s ure contlnult ) and 
knowledgable decisio IS. All 
is ues had to be on tLe agenda 
at least one week before they 
were to be voted on: thi would 
allow the issue to be give n 
thorough considerati .1n. All 
iss ues required a :w(Hh lrds 
majority to pass, so that the 
validity of the vote w6u ld be 
unquestionable. It lo,)ktd good 
on paper. 

It soon became apr:arent that 
apathy could not be ~ Iiminated 
by simply permitting anyone to 
vote. The attendance at Coop 
meetings was occasionally ~igh -
- as many as eventy or eighty 
person . At other times, it was 
difticult to convince a quorum 
to show up and stay. Out of a 
tudent population of more 

than 6000, one would think that 
at lea t one half of one percent 
would be willing to devote a few 
hours a week participating in 

this de-facto government. 
To alleviate this problem of 

non-a ttendance, expecially by 
" Third World" students . . a 
group of persons who regularly 
atte nded Coop meetings, 
among whom was Marco Li 
Mandri, introduced a proposal 
to allow anyone to vote, 
regardless of their previous 
attendance. This was discussed 
by the Coop, and amended to 
exclude budgetary matters, 
which would require attendance 
at one of the last two meetings. 
The motion passed by the 
required two thirds amid JOyous 
anticipat ion of new levels of 
student ·participation . It 
sounded good. 

Coincide ntally, the very next 
week the Coop was to select its 
External Affairs Coordinator, 

tatewide. (UCSD' s represent-
ative on the Student Body 
Pre idents Coul1cil) . The 
candidates were Irma Munoz 
allJ ~1 nrCO , i Mandri as joi nt 
coordinators, Fred peck, and 
Alex Annala. The meeting was 
surprisingly well attended -- by 
the Co mmunications Student 
Union, MECHA, th e "hard-
wre" Coop members, and a 
few people who just came to see 
what the Coop was . Alex 
Annala was ' oon eliminated, 
and discuss ion centered on the 
remaining candidates. Many 

~lUdents were unsatisfied with 
Ihe co ncept of a co-
coo rdinatorship. Que tion as 
to funding two Coordinator 
were rai ed, but never answered 
to everyone' s ati sfaction . 
Oue~t ion as 10 recognition by 

the President's oflke were 
asked: again the answers were 
less than definitive. The vote 
was taken, and Marco and Irma 
wo n, by a vote 01 44 to :lIS . Not 
having the necessary two-thirds, 
a vote of confidence for the pair 
was taken, which passed. 
Immediately afterwards, a large 
number of tudents left the 
meeting -- primarily the 
MECl-IA and Communications 
studen ts. The vote on the next 
issue, which concerned funding 
sources a nd was quite definitely 
nlll a minor matter, showed that 
only 30 persons were in at-
tendance, as opposed to th e 72 
voting in the coordinator 
election . 

This year, the funds which 
were to be found "somewhere" 
were reques ted trom t he 
Campus Acti vity Fee -- exact ly 
what wa not supposed to 
happen. Tbis ycar, Marco and 
Irma have refused to provide 
information relevant to their 
position to the Triton Times --
the official campus newspaper, 
read by better than forty 
percen t of the campus. The 
media they wish to use, the 
subsidia ry jour nal s , reach 
perhap ten percent. They are 
not disseminating information 
to the student s of UCSD, yet 
they are suppo ed to repr!!sent 
us. 

We find no way to correct 
this ituation·- the majority of 
the members of the Committee 
on Appointments and 
Eva luations arc good friends of 
Marco and Irma, and it is not 
unlikely that they may soon be 

sa¥ing " no com ment to the 
Tn ton Times ." At least two 
o ther committees of the Coop 
are a lready doing so . 

The St udent Body Pres id ent s 
Council is at UCSD this Friday . 
One of the subjects they were to 
discuss was the legality of two 
elections -- Santa Barbara and 
Los Angeles. The charges were 
dropped. 

We would like to suggest that 
the SBPC inves ti~ate the 
electio n of Marco LI Mandri 
and Irma Munoz. We would 
like to suggest they ask the two 
the conditions under which they 
we re elccted . We would like 10 
suggest the SBPC find why they 
are, in effect , ' withholding 
in formation from the students 
ofUCSD. 

We feel we are not being 
represented , but ignored. This 
ituation must be corrected.

out, I also let out a s igh of 
relief. But as I start to enter the 
space a vehicle from the op-
posite direction races in it barely 
missing the adjacently parked 
cars. 

Knowing that Revelle 's lots 
will be the same , since 
yesterday' s expedition through 
there was unsuccessful, I head 
out towards the light at the 
Torrey Pines intersection . So it 
happens today that I park on 
the curb opposite the Glider 
Port entrance. Grudgingly, I 
trek back to Muir wondering 
why I bought a $36 "S" parking 
permit. 

When I arrived the next day I 
went through the same search 
procedures. Luckily though, I 
found a space. I wondered why 
I had gotten the space while so 
many other cars were looking 
around? Anyway I was glad . 
An hour later I went oaCi< to my 
car and received an answer to 
my question . The answer was in 
the form of a ticket stating that 
I was parked illegally in a "B'" 
area with a "S" sticker. This 
really topped it off. A fine! 
Because there were no student 
spaces ava ilable, I received a 
fine! 

In the previous paragraphs I 
have tried to state a problem 
which affects all students 
arriving in the late morning 
hours. Unreasonable parkin~ 
for the students having "S' 
parking permits . There are 
ways UCSD can solve this 
problem. Since construction is 
active around campus, just add 
a few small lots whIch cannot be 
occupied before a certain set 
time (10:30 for example) . 
Another idea is to convert parts 
of the temporary lots into these 
mall lots described above. 

But whatever the solution it 
should be attained immediately.

The Emperor , who is a 
marine biologist, re ponded 
that it was "a great 
pleasure ... for me to call at thi s 
world- renow ned institution and 
to meet you who are making 
active and un ceasi ng efforts in 
the fie ld of oceanographic 
re earch." 

The Emperor's remarks were 
tra ns la ted by Ambassador 
Hideki Masaki , a member of 
the Imperial party. 

From the welcoming area 
Hirohito reentered his Iimosine 
And was driven slowly to the 
ba e of the pier. 

A wedge of Secret Service 
agen ts surrounded the limosine, 
spectators were kept out of the 
roa d . Hirohito was then 
transferred to a golf cart, to be 
driven to the end of the Scripps 
Pier, the Emperor's second 
top. 

2,000,000 Whilies killed 

A group of protestors 
carrying signs reading " Extinct 
means forever -. a whale is 
ki lled· every hour," and "Stop 
whaling flOW " lined part of the 
rou te from the wclcoming area 
to the foot of the Scripps Pier, 

the Emperor's ~econd stop. 
The group was protesting 

Japanese and Ru ssian wha ling, 
sayi ng that 2,000,000 whale 
have been killed in the past 50 
years and that the eight species 
of great whale are in danger of 
exttnction because of the 

whalin~ practices of the two 
countnes. 

The prote tors called for the 
boycotting of Japanese goods. 
It was not clear whether the 
Emperor saw the s igns or 
nOllced the protestors. 

During the trip down the pier. 
the Etnperor's vehicle was 
followed by two more, con-
taining Nirerenberg, McElroy. 
members of the Imperial part y. 
SIO deputy director Charles J. 
Merdinger and Secret Service 
agent s. Fifty Japanese and US 
photographers lined the pier. 

A police van wa s seen 
patroning the beach bordering 
Scripps -- which had been closed 
o ff for the visit, a long with the 
Scripps Aquarium -- an d 
frogmen were said to have been 
examining the base of the pier. 

From the pier the Emperor 
viewed the Scripps FLIP 
(floating in trument platform) 
vesse l being towed by another 
SIO vessel, the 209-foot. 1362-
ton Thomas Washington. 

Afterwards, Hirohito was 
driven to the SIO experimental 
aquarium building, where he 
met for more than an hour with 
Scripps faculty members Robert 
R. Hessler and William A . 
Newman . 

Before he entered the wood-
paneled building, the Emperor 
turned and waved to the crowd 
of 100 spectators and jour-
nalists assembled across the 
street. 

Rllre Specimen Presented 

Meanwhile, Japanese and US 
journalists were briefed in the 
SIO Sumner Auditorium on 
what the Emperor and the two 
cientists were doing in their 

laboratory. 
David E. Thi tie, a Scripps 

graduate student, said in a 15-
minute s lide presentation that I 
the Emperor would receive 
several gifts, including an 
album of co lor photographs by 
James R. Lance, a member of 
the ·S IO staff, and a specimen of 
the rare Neopilina, one of an 
ancient class of deep sea 
mollusks that was thought to 
have been extinct until 1952, 
when specimens were taken off 
Co ta Rica at a depth of two 
miles. 

Scripps had six of the 16 
existi ng Neopilina galatheae, 
th e oldest known species of the 
animal. One of th ese was given 
to Hirohito. 

With Hessler, an expert on 
the deepest parts of the ocean, 
the Emperor d iscussed the 
scienti st 's recent trip to the 
Philippine Trench, where he 
successfully took samples of the 
fauna li ving on the ocean floor 
at a depth of six miles. Thistle 
said the Emperor would con-
tra st these samples with 
shallow-water fauna . 

With Newman, Hirohito ' The Emperor waved from tilt top of tile INin leHint to the 510

evolution of marine animals 
and environ ments. During this 
period, the pair discussed and 
exa m ined the Neopilina 
specimen . 

After finishing his sessions 
with the two oceanographers, 
the Emperor left the building, 
walked haltingly down the steps 
-- surrounded by both Secret 

Service and I mperial security 
agents -- with frequent glances 
to the crowd . 

As the Emperor reached his 
limousine, the crowd broke 
spontaneously mto applause, 
which was acknowledged by 
Hirohito with a smile . 

He then shook hands with 
both scientists and entered his 

limosine1 which displayed gold-
. borderea flags of the United 
States and Japan , and left 
Scripps for the San Diego 
airport. He departed at 3: 15.

Newton~John in Vegas, on Disc: the Girl's Got Starch 
by Timothy Mackenzie 

Staff Writer 
Oliyia Newton -John made her Las Vegas 
hea~hner debut a success before capacity 
a udle~ces last weekend at the Riviera Hotel's 
Vcrsa llie Theater . The exceptionally beautiful 
Newton-John has established hersel f, in the past 
yea r, as the most popular female vocalist in the 
wor ld . 

T he enthusia tic response accorded Newton-
John was due mainly to the overall excellence of 
her performance. Her wide variety of selections 
included her own hits ("Let Me Be There" 
"Have You Never Been Mellow" "Pleasc Mr 
Please") as well as some old love son~s ("As 
Time Goes Qy") and a couple of Beatie s tunes 
("Good Day Sunshine," "Honey Pie"). As the 
performance was nearing its cnd, she brought the 
Vegas audience to their feet with a rousing "If 
You Love Me (Let Me Know)" before closing 
wit h the obligatory "I Honest ly Love You." 

I he audIence seemed ~enumelY Impressed not just with Newton-John s singing or her good 
loo ks, but also with her warm vibrant per-
sonality !ln~ her unspoiled character. These 
characteristics provide a subtle shield for the lack 
of range and versatility in her voice. 

The Las Vegas engagement coincided with the 
re lease of Newton-John's latest album entitled 
"Clearly J,-ove." She performed a pair of the 
num~~rs m her show l including a beautiful 
rendItIOn of "He Am't Heavy, He's My

Musica ll y, Olivia Newton-John ha matured 
I rem.endously si nce he firsl appeared on the 
mUSIc scene several years ago. The essential 
e l~ment of her sl:lccess, the soft, virginal voice,.is 
stili there , but II has evolved into a more dif-
finative style . Her lyrics and music are now 
generally better written, and her band is more 

pr~fessional sounding, lending credence to her 
VOIce. 

Most of the songs on "Clearly Love," her new 
release on MCA Records, provide a vehicle for 
lhe scn ual Quality of her voice. The first cuI 
"Somelhing Better to Do" is a prime example of 
that. Written by John Farrar (who also wrote 
" Have .yo~ Ne.~er Been Mellow") it has Newton-
Jo~n smgtng . I Try Not to Moan," in a style 
entIrely remllllSCen t of "Have You Never Been

For the fIrst tIme, Newton-John ~ets into 
slighlly philosophical music with "He Ain't

from a Dylan protest song, it is certainly much 
deeper that " Pl ease Mr . Please" or "Let me Be

Freeze-Dried Theatre: ' It's 
About Time for San Diego 

by Timothy Mackenzie 
At last, San Diego has 

something to offer in the field 
of comedic entertainment; 
Freez- Dried Theater is here. 
The Freez-Dried Theater 
consists of four men and one 
woman who are specifically 
concerned with entertaining 
their audience through the 
techniques of pantomine, comic 
black-outs, improvisations with 
audience participation, and 
hort, well rehearsed segments 
of theater . 

Perhaps the most noticeable 
and humorous asset Freez-
Dried Theater possesses is it's 
visual presence. Even· on the 
rare occasions when . the 
dialogue became stale, the 
visual aspect of the per-
formance kept the audience 
enthralled and the laughter 
~pewing forth . Particularly 
IJ1genuous was the use of strobe 
lighti ng to simulate slow motion 
figh ting seQuenc~s . -

It seemed 'very evident that 
the members of the Freez-Dried 
Theater e!1joy working 
together. Their enthusiasm on 
stage appeared to excite the 
audience. It 's nice to see people 
rooting for each other. 

The comedy ranges from

Most of the successful ex-

periments at UC San Diego 
occur in one of the myriad of 
labs scattered throughout 
campus. One experiment, floor 
hockey, is entering its third 
year, and could be labeled as 
successful, the only difference 
being that it was initiated by the 
Recreation Department. 

UCSD Women's Field Hockey Bows to State 
By Ron Kato 

San Diego State continued to dominate the 
early intercollegiate season over UC San Diego, 
as the Triton women's field hockety team 
became the latest victi ms of the crosstown rivals 
by the score of 4-0. 

The Triton squad opened the sea on last 
Wednesday handicapped with only 10 players (II 
players co nsti.tutes a full playing unit In field 

hockey), while the Aztecs carried a roster of 24 
team members into the game. Despite holding 
the Aztecs scoreless for the first 20 mmutes of the 
game, the Triton's yielded three goals before the 
end of the first hal f. 

Opening the second half against State's second 
unit, UCSD was again held scoreless while the 
Aztecs added a final tally to clo e out the game. 

Continued on Page 7 

The sport, an original idea of 
ex-Rec Supervisor Harry Bloom. 
and now headed by UCSD 
senior Kirk ' Robinson, has 
grown from a handful of teams 
to a strong and popular team 
sport. Although originally 
designed to be a cooed game, 
last year saw the initiation of 
men's hockey, with many men 
now playing m both leagues. 

Although some of the 
original players have graduated, 
most of the hardcore players 
remain, and have formed the 
nucleus for what promise to be 
very competitive and exciting 
leagues. 

I n the cooed division, . last 
year's champion EI Chunko 
should receive stern challenges 
from Ron Beick 's What the 
Puck and Dan Crane's Lex /!nd_ 

the Lugnuts .. Leading What the 
Puck is returning sharpshooter 
Alan Lambert. 

Featuring a freewheeling style 
will be Munch, now minus one 
of their founding fathers, 
Dickie Duncan. The team's one 
problem will be in searching for 
a goaltender who can also play ' 
forward and bench coach. 

Champion EI Chunko will bring 
back the highest scorers in the 
league with Jeff Cannis and 
Kerry Dunne. The two were the 
leading scorers in the male and 
female categories. 

The men's league should be a 
toss-up between Orrgy, Little 
Green Bags and What the Puck, 
as champion EI Chunko has 
disbanded. Orrgy, perhaps Ih~ 
most physical team in the league

V-Ball Women 
Surprise USD 

by Ed Flynn 
With surprising ease, the UC 

San Diego women's volleyball 
team ~isposed of previously 
undefeated University of San 
Diego, 15-3, 15-2 , Wednesday 
afternoon. In what was sup-
posed to be a tough match 
between two unbeaten titans, it 
turned out to be simple for the; 
Tritons to run their record to 4-
O. 

Aware of the importance of a 
win over USD, the Tritons 
played well from the outset, 
dominating the match. The two 
games were nearly identical, 
wit h USD falling behind early in 
both, and' never coming close. 

Coach Chuck Milenbah 
described the win as "a total 
effort." He cited the Triton 
passing and defense as the key 
elements in the victory. UC-
SD's play at the net was par-
tic ularly impressive, as 
numerous spikes ended up on 
the USD side of the court. The 
play of Page Bradshaw, Holly 
Slewart, and Andrea Beylen 
stood out as UCSD took sole 
control of first place in their 
league. 

A Triton prepares to spike as 
the USD line goes up for the 
block. 

Non·Sexist Dance 
uc San Diego's third "non-

sexist dance" will be held today 
at 8:30 pm in the Muir Five & 
Dime. 

Sponsored by the Gay 
Student Association and the 
Women's Center, the dance is 
designed to "free people from 
the social pressures present at 
most tradittonal dances," says 
Michele Stone, a member of the 
Women's Center. 

She said the fonnat will 
provide a more free a t-
mosphere, where "people can 
either dance alone or with 
anyone they want to," avoidin~ 
what she called the "pick-up' 
nature of most dances. 

There is no admission 
change , The dance is open to 
the entire UCSD commuDlty. 

, 

Mee'tillg Changed 
The meeting for the Alice 

Doesn't Day scheduled for 
Thursday, October 9, has been 
rescheduled for Tuesday, 
October 14, in the north 
conference room of the student 
center. Linda D' Addario, the 
San Diego Coordinator of 
Women's Strike Day will give 
an informal talk about the 
October 29 event. All interested 
students, faculty and staff are 
invited to attend. 

Career Cassettes 
At the Career Planning 

Library, Matthews Campus a 
new-audio-cassette library has 
been added to the Health 
Sciences Advisory Program this 
quarter. 

Students can listen to people 
in a variety of health science 
careers talking informally about 
what they do and how they 
happened to get into their 
specific fields . The tapes in-
clude pharmacy, biomedical 
engineering, nursing, hospital 
administration, phYSical 
therapy, music therapy, medical 
social work, medical librarian, 
speech pathology, and many 
more. 

Running times for the 
caSsettes vary from twelve to 
twenty minutes and are 
unrehearsed and unedited. 

~pace Disp~a! 
The first space mission of an 

HEAO satellite, the largest 
unmanned scientific satellite to 
date, will be the subject of a 
special display October 13- 17 at 
UC San Diego in the Central 
University Library lobby. 

The 7-by-lO-foot exhibit 
prepared by the National 
AerQnautics and Space 
Admini stration, includes 
photos, drawings, written 
explanations and an audio tape 
giving information about the 
satellite which will contain an 
experiment designed and built 
atUCSD. 

The HEAO, an acronym for 
High Eneq~y Astronomy 
Observator, WIll be launched in 
April 1977 to scan and map the 
sky for x-ray sources and 
measure gamma ray flux . 

The UCSD package, one of 
four experiments on board , will 
try to determine the position, 
spectrum and time variations, 

inten~ity and other properties of 
- certam x-rays and ~amma rays. 

Principal invesllgators are 
Laurence Peterson, UCSD 
professor of physics, and 
Walter Lewin, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 

Paramedic rrrailliltg 
San Diego County's second 
m~bi.le intensive care paramedic 
tramlng program began last 

Mon~ay at a University 
Ho~pllal annex. The program is 
deSIgned to train existing 
emergency teams to provide 
prompt definitive treatment at 
the scene of an accident or 
medical emergency. 

The five-month training 
program will include two 
months of classroom st udy in 
the hospital 's Kearny Center 
annex, a month in a base 
hospital located in the -par-
ticipant's home area, and two 
months of field work under 
supervision. 

Funds for training come from 
a federal HEW grant awarded 
in 1974 to the Department of 
Anesthesia, UCSD School of 
Medicine. The county office of 
Emergency Medical Services, 
under the . direction of Sylvia 
Micik, is resl?onsible for 
paramedic operallons.

priorities." These "~ripes and 
housing could be like. ' 

Pric ,Food, and Aesthetics 
Students were also asked to 

"rate their gripes and ' 

priorities" included : noise, 
roommates j suitemates, pricel activities, ocation, food ana 
aesthetics. The top three 
concerns were price, food and 
activities. 

"Price and food," states 
Jane Ferguson, pres ident 
assistant at Galathea Hall , "are 
thi ngs we can't really do 
anything about. There are, 

. however, different possibilities 
for activities." 

One idea to promote 
students' activities would be the 
formation of activity or theme 
houses. One possible J;>lan 
discussed was that "Vaflous 
floors, houses or suites in the 
Dorm be designated to certain 
specific interests with activities 
geared to those specific in-
terests ." Two examples are 
language houses and cultural 
houses. 

Other housing alternatives 
include co-op living, mobile 
home parks and community 
houses. These projects could 
involve all four of the colleges. 
Such a 'plan would nave 
students hving on a college 
other than the one they attend . 
The idea is to "get away from a 
totally academic atmosphere." 

"A student can become easily 
isolated," observes Ferguson, 
"especiallY in the Unit-one 
• mud- huts' at Revelle where the 
the suites are architecturally 
separated from one another. 
The new concepts could help 
eliminate this problem." 

The group is planning a 
campaign to further as ess the 
need of student housins. They 
are aiming for completion of a 
viable J;>roposal to present to the 
Admimstration before next 
year's budget is planned. Any 
students interested in alternative 
dorms are asked to attend the 
next meeting Tuesday night at 7 
pm in the Galathea lounge.

SBPC ... 
posi tion on the council, rather 
than SBPC. 

ASUCSB Vice President Tom 
Hicks believes that the Moran 
case is a UCSB affair that does 
not necessitate SBPC in-
terference. 

Unhealthy Cynicism 
Last Jun e the UCSB 

Chancellor's Ad Hoc Com-
mittee to Investigate the 
Election wrote, "An already 
unhealthy cynicism about 
politics can only be encouraged 
by (Moran and Robinson's) 
continuation in office in these 
ci rcumstances. " 

The next day, the UCSB 
Legislative CounCIl censured the 
two "Cor their injudicious and 
perhaps unethical conduct" in 
the spring election. 

On September 29, another of 
Moran's spring opponents 
Walt Wilson, filed a request fo~ 
a ASUCSB Judicial Council 
hearing, claimin~ he can prove 
M9ran and RQbmson's guilt. 
;.yllson conten~s that, besides 
Illegal campaign practices 
Moran and Robinso n are in: 
volved in a huge "cover-up" 
scheme, possibly he strongly 
hinted, with the UCSB ad-
ministration and dean oC 
students office. 

Wilson believes that the 
stamp violation is only "the tip 
of the iceberg" and says he has 
information and documents 
proving ~oran and Robinson's 
wrongdoln~ and the UCSB 
administrallon's complicity in 
the "cover-up." 

)'v'ilson's charge revolves 
around a fee for use of the 
ASUCSB Printin~ Office 
folding machine, whIch he said 
the two president's failed to 
report inillally and later found 
t~ . exceed the $50 spending 
hmlt. 

Moran responded to this bi' 
saying the "charge is baseless .' 

Wilson feels that the only 
solution is to have Moran and 
Robinson permanently expelled 
from office and to release all 
information to the public.

members of the Imperial arty, 
followed. 

Zoo Trip Earlier 
The visit to Scripps followed' 

one to the San Diego Zoo, 
where the Emperor spent the 
morning touring the facility 
with ' the Empress Nagako. 

• While there the Imperial couple 
was able to view and pet one of 
the Zoo's prized koala bear, 
one of the world's more scarce 
animals. 

Relief from Burdens 
The Emperor is in San 

Francisco tooay, and will spend 
two days in Hawaii before 

returnin~ to Japan. 
Security has been extensive 

throughout the Emperor's two-
week stay but it has been 
particularly stringent in 
California 10 view .of the two 
recent alleged attempted 
assasinations of President Ford. 
In addition, there have been 
threats made against the 
Emperor by Japanese terrorist 
groups. 

Hlrohito, the first Japanese 
Emperor to venture to the 
Umted States, is thought to be 
the 124th direct descendant of 
Japanese legend's first 
Emperor, Jimu . 

Hirohito's is the world 's 
older Imperial family. 

Though Hirohito's position i 
largely a ceremonial one, it was 
his decision that led Japan to 
urrender during World War II. 

He has always maintained that 
he opposed the decision to 
bomb Pearl Harbor and start 
the war, though some hi torians 
claim he was instrumental in 
fueling the rise of militarism in 
Japan in the 1930s. 

Following the war , the 
Emperor was declared "the 
symbol of the state and of the 
unity of the people." 

Previously, the Jaranese 
emperor was thought 0 as a 
god. 

Waterpolo ... 

tercolle~iate or intramural 
ports,' remarked Coach 

Becker, "Yet, we lack the funds 
to efficiently establish an ef-
fective program. Waterpolo i 
just a important as some 
academic courses .con idering it 
involves developmenl of a 
person socially, morally, 
mentally, and physically and 
involves a confrontation with 
problems that occur in reality 
and not in a classroom." 

The Tritons will tangle with 
the University of Arizona 
Friday at 4:00 in the pool. 

Hockey •.•

roster and should use the arne 
style this season. Captain Jeff 
Kirsner will play defense, and 
remain the team' leader. . 

Bags, the squad which plays 
in the cooed league under the 
pseudonym Lex, remains the 
same as last year, and with 
added experience should be 
hard to handle. The male 
contingent of What the Puck is 
the same as that which plays on 
the cooed team of the same 
name. They are perhaps the 
most versatile of all teams, as 
their players are equaJly adept 
playing any position. Since the 
team is large, the bench is just 
as strong as the front line. 

No matter what the league, 
play this quarter should be 
exciting. For tho e who are not 
familiar with the game, play will 
be in the Recreation Gym, 
Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday 
nights. If the game sounds 
interesting, come out and watch 
or perhaps join a team . 

Gregory ... 
Serious and Comedic Vein 
Prior to discussing the 

conspiracy claims Gregory 
spoke 3,t great length on a whole 
serie of Issues in both a serious 
and comedic vein.

could anyone seriously want to 
kiU Gerald Ford! That's like 
wanting to kill Pinnochio" - to 
jokes about the economy -

. "food is so high it's cheaper to 
eat money" - Gregory made 
everyone laugh at themselves by 
exposing the hansups common 
to peopre in American soci~~y: 

Gregory went on to cntlclze 
the American educational 
system. He ~aid that there is 
less freedom at American 
colleges and universities than 
with pimps, whores and thieves. 

"There is more honesty in a 
tavern," Gregory said, "than at 
this university (UCSD)." 

Speaking to the audience, 
Gregory said, "You're going to 
have to change the university 
where you are all programmed 
into a university of love. " 

"Its time to stop talking 
about literature and hIstory and 
to start talking about ethics and 
integrity." Gregory said the 
universIties have failed because 
there is still so much ignorance. 

He said that you don't need 
to ~o throughout the world 
lookmg for ignorance but only 
two blocks from the university. 

Saying that colleges don't 
allow a person to analyze the 
whole problem that is facing 
America, Gregory called on the 
university to "stop in-
doctrinating and to start 
educating.' ,

Hayden ••• 
More .Acceptable Candidate 

Hi motto i , "The radicalism of the sixties i the common sen e 
of the seventies." Tom Hayden, a radical of the sixties, has 
transformed himself into a more acceptable candidate who hope 
to be able to identify with the common man. The most "radical" 
change Hayden is pursuing is an extension of the Bill -of Rights to 
protect the common man from "the encroachment of arbitrary 
economic power. " 

On the subject of American technicians in the Middle' East, 
Hayden had no "qualm or ob~ections to the agreements," as long 
as II was a "peace settlement' and not lust a piece of paper. He 
described our involvement in the Middle East as somethlOg caused 
by the need to protect the interests of the "multi-national fac-
tions." 

On the subject of gun control, he stated that he supported efforts 
to control the sale of hand guns but also said that since he thought 
that this country was "created in violence," the end of hand gun 
sale would not mean the end of violence. 

Local Issues 

Hayden did his best to hit hard on the local issues and stressed 
the fact that those who work for his elections concern themselves a 
much as they can with the problems of their comml,mity. AlTlDng 
the things he opposed directly involving San Diego were: the "slap 
on the wrist" given to C. Arnholt Smith for millCing the public out 
of millions of dollars; the carrying of guns by campus police at San 
Diego State University and other colleges, the hIring of "scab" 
labC?r in the Solar strike, and the cancelling of the Equal Oppor-
tunlly Program. 

In ~is con~luding st~tement, H.ayden warned his supporters to 
"not Just believe" 10 hi personality. He went on to proclaim that 
"the day when campaigns are built on promises hould be over."
