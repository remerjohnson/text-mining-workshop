Hunrin& for a job after graduation 
doesn't have to be a lonely and 
frustrating process. Through the Job 
Search Club, a workshop sponsored by 
the Career Services Center each year, 
students work with experienced career 
counselors to learn assenive job search 
strategies. 

In the club, which convenes June 24 
through July 17 in ten two-hour 
sessions, time is spent actually looking 
for work, rather than just talking about 
it. Students learn to identify and 
aniculate thei r marketable skills (0 
employers and use "networking" to find 
jobs in competitive fields. 

According to Craig Schmidt, one of 
the leaders of the workshop, the Job 
Search Club "teaches techniques that 
panicipants can apply to any job search 
throughout their working lives." 

"Before I JUSt thought the process was 
haphazard and a lucky son of 
occurrence. Now I realize there is a 
strategy and how 10 make it work," said 
one panicipant of last year's club. 

Working with other graduates 
enhances the experience. "It was 
comforting (0 share all the awkwardness 
of a job search with others." commented 
anodler former club graduate. 

Srudents who have not yet lined up a 
job should plan 10 attend . Sign-ups 
begin May 15 and enrollment is limited . 
Space is available on a first-come , first-
served basis. More information and 
applications are available at the Career 
Services Center, HL 1058. 

o 
Summer Session at UCSD may be 

more of a pain than anticipated. That is 
why the Student Health Service will be 
available to all enrolled Summer Session 
students and (0 all continuing 
undergraduate , graduate and medical 
students for a one-time $25 fee. 

The registration fee for regularly 
enrolled Summer Session students 
includes this 525 fee , and for an other 
students the fee may be paid to the 
cashier at the Student Health Service 
beginning June 17; it must be paid by 
the time of first use of the health service 
during the summer. 

The fee will provide access to the 
regular services offered during the 
academic year; special services will 
continue' at their same rates as well. 

The Student Limited Insurance Plan 
(SUP) is not in effect during the 
summer, so students are encouraged to 
enroU in the Voluntary Plan (VIP) to 
obtain co~rage for owpatient services 
such as emergency room use and 
specialist consultations. 

Additional information may be 
obtained by calling 452-3300 or by

a 
A sprciaI mrain& of the University of 

California Board of Regents has been 
scheduled for June 10, from 10 am (0 
approximaaely 3:30 pm, in UCLA's 
Royce HaD. Public testimony regarding 
UC investments in companies with ties 
to South Africa will be invited during 
the afternoon. 

To include as many different 
viewpoints as possible on the issue , 
University officials plan to devote a 
major ponion of the afternoon to 
receive public testimony, with time 
reserved for speakers who submit 
written statements in advance and for 
Â·open microphone" statements. 

Written requests to speak must be 
received by the Secretary of the Regents 
no later than 5 pm on Monday, June 3. 
They should be addressed (0 650 
University Han, 2199 Addison St, 
Berkeley, ~ 720. Speakers should 
indicate if mey represent an 
organization . 

Since it is anticipated that there will 

be more requests to speak than time will 
allow, University officials will make a 
final selection to ensure fair 
representation . 

In addition , written statements not 
exceeding five pages in length, from 
prospective speakers and Others, will be 
accepted and forwarded to the Regents. 
Deadline for submission is June 3. 

Speakers for the "open microphone" 
ponion of the program will be selected 
by lot at the meeting. 

The morning session of the meeting, 
which begins at 10 am, will be devoted 
to a review of Treasurer Herben 
Gordon's special repon, plus other 
informational presentations. The 
Treasurer's study was requested by the 
Regents in January and, in part, will 
summarize current University policies , 
holdings and investment options as they 
relate to companies doing business in 
South Africa. 

The public testimony ponion will 
begin about 1:15 pm. Scheduled 
speakers will be limited to five minutes 
each; the "open microphone" 
panicipants will be limited to two 
minutes. 

UCLA was chosen as the site of this 
special meeting to give Southern 
California constituencies, including 
faculty, staff, students and the general 
public, an opponunity to air their views 
directly to the Regents, said Board Chair 
Vilma Maninez, who called the meeting 
in consultation with UC President David 
P. Gardner. This complements several 
public discussions of the issue already 
held or scheduled in Northe rn 
California. 

The Board is scheduled to act on its 
investment policy at its June 20-21 
meeting at the UC Extension Center in 
San Francisco. The Regents are 
expected to vote on Friday morning, 
June 21.

a 
T~nty-lWO scholars have been 

selected as the first fellows in a 
University of Calfornla program 
deSigned to provide opponunities and 
incentives to ethnic minorities and 
women to pursue academic careers. 

The President's FeDowship Program 
will award a total of 5500,000 in 
stipends and research-related grants to 
l7 postdoctoral students and five 
dissertation year students for one year, 
beginning in July. The new program is 
being supponed through University 
discretionary funds. 

The purpose of the program is to 
combat a serious lack of female and 
ethnic minority faculty members at uc. 
Although their proponion is slowly 
increasing, women currently comprise 

just 11.9% and ethnic minorities only 
1O.2% of tenured faculty. 

Women and ethnic minorities are 
severly underrepresented in several 
fields, including computer science, 
mathematics, business, engineering, life 
sciences and physical sciences. For 
example, only 1.8% of the engineering 
faculty are women. In the life sciences, 
only 6.9% are ethnic minorities. 

To increase the availability of faculty 
candidates in those areas, applications 
for the President's Fellowship were 
recruited from throughout the US and 
other countries. 

Each postdoctoral fellow will receive a 
521,000 stipend, with another 54,000 
for research and travel. Dissenation year 
fellows, who were drawn from within 
the UC system; will receive a stipend of 
513,500 plus 51,500 for expenses. 

Besides receiving the stipend, fellows 
also have a designated faculty "mentor" 
who will help guide them. "AU people 
reaDy need good mentors. They need 
someone who is going to show them the 
ropes of the profession, how to present 
themselves and their work," said Susan 
Blyant, professor of developmental and 
cell biology at UC Irvine and a member 
of the program's advisory committee. 

Applicants for the fellowship were 
rated on their academic performance as 
well as the soundness of their research 
proposals. Because those selected were 
so highly qualified, they will not need 
academic tutoring, said Frank 
Talamantes, a UC Santa Cruz professor 
of biology and a mentor in the program. 

Talamantes said the FeDowship' 
Program is an important vehicle for 
increasing minority and women faculty 
at Uc. "There's a need for (faculty) role 
models for the sweep of minority kids 
who are going to come to this school," 
he said. 

The University began seeking 
applicants last fall and drew a pool of 
248 candidates. Fellows were selected 
by faculty committees representing the 
nine campuses and the targeted 
disciplines. 

One of the feDows selected, Carolyn 
A. Dean, will study mathemarics at 
UCSD.

Fomler student killed in police shooting 
By PHIL WlLLON, Associate News Editor 

A FORMER UCSD STUDENT was shot to death by San Diego police officers early Tuesday 
morning after he ran through a 
residential neighborhood in San Marcos 
with a butcher knife threatening to kill 
himself or attack anyone who 
approached him, police said 
Wednesday. 

Wayne Douglas Holden , a 2l-year-old 
philosophy major, had apparently 
Jumped through a window of a house 
and was running toward a resident 
inside when two police officers shot 
him six times in the back and arm 
according to homicide investigator 'Lt. 
Paul Ybarrondo. He was pronounced 
dead at 9:57 am at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital of gun shot wounds to the 
chest and back, a coroner's deputy said . 

Holden was a junior and was in the 
process of transferring to UC Santa 
Cruz. . 

According to Holden's father, Roben, 
his son was spending the night at his 
house. He had been acting strange and 
was talking of committing suicide, with 
a knife he retrieved from his father'S 
kitchen, from 2 am until 7 am before 
the authorities were alened. His father 
said he had requested that County 
Mental Health handle the situation but 
that the police came instead. Ybarrondo 
said that Holden was distraught over a 
fight he had with his girlfriend, also a 
UCSD student, and was possibly under 
the influence of a hallucinogen. 

The Coroner's Office said that the lab 
results on whether Holden was under 
the influence of any drugs will be in 

later this week. 
"He was threatening 10 kill himself or 

stab himself if any of the officers went 
near him," Ybarrondo said. "Some of his 
friends and acquaintances indicated 
that he might have been on LSD, but 
we're still waiting for the results of the 
autopsy." 

At 7:08 am eight police officers were 
caned 10 Holden's father'S house , on the 
6000 block of Sunny Brae Drive in San 
Carlos, to deal with a man threatening 
10 commit suicide. When they arrived 
on the scene, they found Holden 
outside on the sidewalk holding a 12'" 
butcher knife , saying he would kin 
himself. Holden was dressed only in a 
robe and underwear. 

The offi.:ers spent 20 minutes trying 
to persuade him to drop the knife, but 
Holden refused and lunged at anyone 
who approached him, Ybarrondo said. 
An officer equipped with a stun gun, a 
non-lethal weapon designed to shoot 
electrode dans, then arrived on the 
scene, but Holden fled before the officer 
could get close enough to use it 

While he was running, Holden 
stabbed at several cars driving down the 
street and anempted to enter three of 
them, Ybarrondo said . 

The officer with the stun gun, 
Sergeant Roben Stinson, followed 
behind in a squad car for six blocks 
before he pulled In front and tried to 
subdue him, on Golfcrest Drive, but 
Holden ave ned the officers by running 
into the front yard of a nearby house. 

According to police , Holden then

A student murdered as injustice reigns 
Now that San Diego's police force has gradually become a licensed 

group of careless vigilantes, maybe the community at large will re-
evaluate the way in which they condone reactionary violence. The 
various incidents of murder by decree this spring are a clear indication 
that thoughtful America has failed miserably in understanding the plight 
of the emotionally disturbed and socially alienated . This is not to say 
that it is the fault of those "rebellious individuals" to adapt to society's 
standard modes of behavior (e .g., Sagon Penn, Stephen Robens, Wayne 
Holden), but rather a specific community's ignorance to what degree 
those supponed by state power will go to weed out the bad apples. In 
Philadelphia, the city government found it necessary to bum down a 
neighborhood and murder innocent children 'to "restore order." In San 
Diego, five police officers deemed it appropriate to kill former UCSD 
student Wayne Douglas Holden because they were afraid that a 140 lb. 
21-year-old kid wielding a butcher knife might have taken his own life, 
or attacked his neighbors while facing five guns aimed at his head. 

Is this the answer to curing the ills of society? Here we have a person 
hysterical after a recent break-up with his girlfriend, running around 
suburban San Carlos in a bathrobe yelling "Call the cops" to the group 
of policemen who were surrounding him. Quite a bitter irony, isn't it? It 
is possible Wayne was yelling for a real police force, one that helps you 
when in distress. It has been said that a person close to death has no 
problem distinguishing between good and evil. 

So Wayne Holden jumped through the window of a neighbor, Bill 
Ballard, Jr. , and fell to the ground in a heap of glass. Ballard said that 
Holden was making no threatening moves toward him, although the 
police dispute that, and when told by police Officer Bob Stinson not to 
move, he stood up, and consequendy was shot six times (once by 
Stinson and five times by Officer Carl Smith). He was shot twice in the 
right thigh , once in the right arm, once in the rib cage, once in the 
lower back, and once through the upper back. What, may we ask, were 
these cowardly vigilantes thinking when they were taking target practice 
at the distraught Holden? Obviously, they weren't pondering the sanctity 
of human life, nor of other viable methods of disarmament. The answer 
is most likely that they were not thinking at all, but merely acting on

Zionist nukes 
By N. EL MOUD]AHID 

Dr. Ja~ob Goldberg gave a lecture on 
Zionism and apanheid on Tuesday, May 
21. He is known in the Political Science 
Depanmem as an objective, 
knowledgeable professor. Neither of 
these qualities appeared in his talk, and 
my commentary concerns the answer he 
gave when a member of the All African 
Peoples Revolutionary Parry asked about 
the lecturer's opinion on the Kryton 
affair. Dr. Goldberg (nO! so) surpriSingly 
denied any nuclear military power to 
Israel, and therefore assured that the 
Krytons must have been purchased for 
laser technology purposes. 

The Krytons are 1 wxr devices used 
m weapons research and in medical 

laser technology. But, more importantly. 
they can be used as triggers in nuclear 
explosions. Eight thousand one hundred 
of these devices were shipped to lsrael 
between 1980 and 1982 , which already 
makes it difficult to believe that they 
were all destined for medical laser 
Â·research. Moreover, the shipment was 
divided into several installments of ten 
to 100 pieces, illegally exponed as 
"general destination" radio amplifiers. 
EG&G Inc. of Wellesley, Massachusetts, 
the only company that makes Krytons . 
says all purchasers are warned of the 
requiremem of special pennits for 
exportation of the devi.::es. 

Funhennore , Amon Mi1chan, the 

bloody' primeval instinct, and that is why five trained "officers of the 
law" could not disarm one small, hysterical student. 

Ponder, though, who gave the orders to shoot instead of asking the 
officers who were involved in the 45-minute cat-and-mouse game of 
keepi-ng Wayne at bay to take the knife away without injury, like a 16-
year-old manial arts student could do. Might it be that the San Diego 
police force is trained to eliminate any disturbance to the domineering 
lifestyle of the suburban status quo? 

"He was going to be a great philosopher until he was gunned down," 
said Robert Holden, Wayne's father. A student of philosophy indeed. It 
is suspected that Wayne was the same person who stood up at a 
meeting for the South African movement at Winnie Mandela Library on 
civil obedience training and informed the collective that he was 
assaulted by police officers a few days prior for yelling at an officer for 
damaging his driver's license. If that is so (and the stories given by 
coalition members and Wayne's father concur inadvenendy), then 
Wayne Holden may be UCSD's first victim of social apartheid. 

Isn't it fitting for a police state to respond to a call for help with 
malevalent destruction? Raben Holden dialed emergency number 911 in 
an attempt to get the county mental health unit over to his house in 
order to calm Wayne down. Instead of receiving the kind of assistance 
necessary for this type of dilemma, they were referred to the San Diego 
Police, who prompdy showed up at the Holdens' front door. When 
Wayne saw the police walking up to his from step, he blew up. 
Henceforth, death. 

Most of us will be leaving for the summer in three weeks time. This 
has been a highly emotional year for La Jolla on the hill; we at the 
Guardian are consistendy shocked by the increase of injustice all around 
us. All of us get slapped around in one manner or another during our 
lives. San Diego's finest have very little tolerance for dissenters; they 
desire no trouble in paradise. If this is paradise, though, then where 
does freedom lie in its scheme? If there was ever a time to stand up for 
your fellow students, it is now. Can we dispell the violence? 

Israeli film producer and arrns merchant 
who was an imponant intennediary in 
the shipment, assured Newsweek that 
"Ll}e Krytons were ordered (in writing) 
for the Israeli Defense Ministry." 

What made Dr. Goldberg's answer 
unacceptable was his deliberate denial 
of the possession of nuclear weapons by 
Israel Indeed , I refuse to believe that an 
"expert" in Middle East affairs does not 
know that Israel is "widely presumed to 
have the abiliry to manufacture nuclear 
weapons ..... (May 27 issue of Time, p. 
32). Scientific and journalistic repons 
have repeatedly been showing that Israel 
already has a few dozen nuclear bombs 
in its possession. The fact is that Time 
reported some time ago, in an anicle on 
who has nuclear capability and nuclear 
bombs, that Israel is in possession of 
more than 20 of them. The fact that 
Israel can safely deny having them is 
because they are disassembled in pans 
so that they cannot be classified as 
nuclear bombs. But what should be 
known is that their assembly involves 
just a matter of hours. A proof of lsrael's 

-~c 
posseSSion of nuclear weapons can be 
found in the military repons that 
followed the 1973 war in which Golda 
Meir, then prime minister of Israel, 
ordered the bombs to be assembled and 
made ready for a possible use. in case 
of need . 

In addilion to that, about a year ago, 
Time reponed that a few pounds of 
plutonium missing from an East Coast 
nuclear reactor had turned up in lsrael, 
which, being a non-Signer of the non-
proliferation treaty, is not obliged to 
open its nuclear facilities to inspection. 
Israel's refusal to any request for 
inspection, even by the International 
Agency for Nuclear Technology, cenainly 
raises questions about Istael's credibiliry. 

In conclusion, I was disappointed by 
the lack of objectiviry on the pan of Dr. 
Goldberg, and especially by his 
underestimate of our knowledge of the 
facts . The people who invited Dr. 
Goldberg should take notice, in the 
future, that the students on campus are 
more knowledgeable and conscientious 
than they seem to think.

Viewpoint 
Oceania 
By PETER SURDEllITTO 

Why do I hate this place so much? I mean, is it 
really all that bad? Hmmmmmm, yeah. I think so. I've 
thought a lot about it, and I, as an individual student 
with a clear-cut definition of what an educational 
institution should accomplish. must condemn UC San 
Diego, as it has been unsatisfactory in its endeavors to 
become a true universiry. 

By now I'm sure you're wondering what my 
standards are for a university , true? Well, I'd be happy 
to outline what is satisfactory. OK, I believe an 
educational institution should be beneficial to the 
individual. (Yes, I am one of those "Individual's Rights" 
radicals. Sue me .) I believe that college should be a 
place where one can get a beller definition of one's 
self. A place where one can interact with a variety of 
subcultures and can thus place him or herself 
somewhere in society. It should be a place where both 
curriculum and environment should help the 
individual grasp a greater tange of thinking. The 
university should foster the definition of what is 
acceptable and unacceptable in- society; in other words, 
it should help the individual, through a wide variety of 
inOuences, to define his or her own sense of principles 
by which to live In society. In shon, it should be a 
place where one can get one's act together before 
hitting the road. as well as a place to learn cenain 
skills for a desired occupation (i.e .. the acquisition of a 
skill geared for the work world should be the excuse 
for going to college, but the interactions geared toward 
personal growth should be the reason). 

UC San Diego's size is the institution's greatest 
benefit as well as its worst. Only through its size can it 
offer the many services it does , such as: almost 
unlimited use of computers, the tutorial program 
OASIS. vaSt Iibtary resources and psychological and 
health services. But the school's size also devalues the 
individual to the point where the student becomes a 
living transcript. 

Indeed, UCSD is too big-my own problems in 
dealing with the bureaucratic machine tell me this. For 
the larger the institution involved , the less efficient it 
becomes in dealing with different personalities until 
everything that is accomplished is solely wrought for 
the working of the whole. In an abstract sense. UCSD 
can be compared to the USSR-the sacrifice of the 
individual for the workings of the aggregate . Even the . 
teaching assistants I've talked to feel this . The 
educational machine demands so much of the 
individual to a poim where there is no free time. All 
actions are either necessarily practical or are neglected. 

In the area of concrete education, UCSD has a 
reputation for excellence in the sciences. This much is 
true. But I often question even this. Again , the 
largeness of the school and the reputation tacked on to 
it give it an intensity that cannot be expressed in 
words. Speaking as an individual, I can say without 
hesitation that the information that needs to be 
learned all comes too fast for it to make any lasting 
impression on the student; once the final exam is 
taken. the course seems to fade away. Truly, the 
education at UCSD is geared toward the elite. which is 
tragic because most of the people here are not part of 
that class (myself incl4ded), but are convinced that 

they are; consequently, they spend their time knocking 
their brains out for the satisfactory grade of "C" which 
is, without question , something to be celebrated . 

The further retardation of the individual is also 
accomplished through the rigid curriculum. Just a look 
around is enough to tell you that through wild clothes 
and spectacularly appalling appearances. students are 
trying to find an identity and to define themselves in 
the rubber-stamp atmosphere of the school. 

I really must pity those who actually graduate from 
this school, as they must have no sense of what "real 
life" is. I have met three alumni in my stay here and 
they all openly regret having spent their college years 
here; they all seem [0 say the same thing, too-that 
they wished they could have learned the more 
imponant lessons of living and of interaction, rather 
than the concrete skill-oriented studies that got them

responSibility. 
This intense isolation that I have just outlined 

breeds within the individual a sense of profound 
worthlessness. This is iUustrated by the fact that UCSD 
has the highest suicide rate of any educational 
instirution on the West Coast (strangely enough, it also 
has the reputation of being one of the best educational 
institutions in the country). The turnover rate here 
seems to say it aD as weD-more than 60% of the 
people who stan here don't finish here (this statistic is 
from studies done in the 1970s). And a good 
percentage of those who leave UCSD don't transfer to 
other colleges; wasn't I just saying something about 
individual wonhlessness? I wouldn't let my kid go 
here. 

So all in all we have a psychosocial moratorium 
imposed by an overwhelming bureaucracy whose 
purpose of turning indiv.iduals into unquestioning 
creatures quietly in a sociery of drones is met without 
opposition. 

Oceania is here.

Viewpoint 

In support of corporatism 
By ADRIAN ROBERTS 

(continued from Monday) 
Stevens also refutes the contention 

that O[her nations would "follow suit if 
the US were to slap trade sanctions on 
South Africa or enforce a policy of 
disinvestment" when he quotes a 
spokesman at the West German 
Embassy in Washington: "We have no 
laws restricting investments and 
business abroad ( ... ) If US companies 
pull out, O[her Western companies will 
step in." The Japanese could and 
probably would supply as sophisticated 
computers to South Africa as American 
companies currently do. American 

1:.1Isiness would lose out to foreign 
investment (the Free Enterprise System), 
and. it is highly unlikely that foreign 
busmesses would be as willin,lt to adhere 
to the Sullivan Principles (promoting equal 
treatment of blacks and whites in business-
es) as many American firms have been. 

If we (the US) remove American 
interests, we also surrender our only tool 
of pressuring positive changes on the 
South African government, as few or as 
slow as they may be. One should nO[ 
underestimate South Africa's potential 
for self-sufficiency, nor the strength of 
free trade worldwide (foreign countries 

"HAPPY DAN PERETTIE" 

who would nO[ follow America's example 
of isolating South Africa) , and least of all 
should one underestimate the fierce 
resolve of the South African government 
to resist what it calls outside aggressive 
attempts 10 tell South Africans how they 
should run their country-a logical 
response, for I cannot think of a single 
country on earth whose government 
would take kindly to another country 
telling it how to run its internal affairs , 
At least adherence to the Sullivan 
Principles is a force acting within the 
country-and in the end, all lasting 
change must come from within ,

On the matter of whether or not 
South African blacks favor 
disinvestment, much has been misstated 
by proponents of disinvestment in the 
US. Famed South African author, Alan 
Paton, an 82-year resident of South 
Africa and long time opponent of 
apartheid, writes in an article published 
in the San DitÂ£o Union: "One often hears 
black South Africans cry: 'We don't 
mind suffering. We are used to it.' But 
this cry usuaDy comes from those 
articulate blacks who suffer least. I, as a 
Christian, will have nothing to do with 
disinvestment. To believe that 
disinvestment will bring our government 
'to its knees' is to believe nonsense." 

In a March 17, 1985 interview (in the 
San Diego Union) with Hennan Cohen, 
US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, 
the question was asked if aD South 
African blacks were in agreement on 
disinvestment. Cohen answered: "No. 
That's another aspect of the good news. 
We financed a poll by a very respected 
sociologist named Professor Schlemmer 
in the University of Natal who happens 
to be the head of the South African 
Institute of Race Relations, which is a 
very anti-apartheid group. He 
determined among African industrial 
workers that they believe in American 
investment, they want more of it, and 
they like the benefits they're getting 
from American investment even though 
they hate apartheid and they hate the 
government in power right now. So 
there is absolutely minimal support, tiny 
support for disinvestment in asking us 
to get out of South Africa." In fact many 
South African blacks as well as whites 
would see disinvestment as an attack on 
them by the US, not as an attempt to 
help them. 

Recent threats of disinvestment by the 
US have helped add strength to the 
right wing opposition to the "moderate" 
National Party led by Botha. In recently 
held regional elections, the right wing 
party of Treurnicht made some 
substantial gains. It is clear that 
disinvestment will, in all likelihood, fail 
and even help bring to power a party 
which wants to return to stricter forms 
of apartheid laws. Even those who favor 
disinvestment as a moral statement must 
be willing to recognize this danger. They 
should perhaps re-examine their morals 
if such would be the result of 
disinvestment. 

Slow, positive changes over a long 
period of time will result in just that-
pOSitive, if slow, betterment. Rapid 
changes of a radical nature could very 
easily result in a situation similar to , but 
worse than, that occuring in Zimbabwe 
today: the blacks united long enough to 
overthrow the whites, then split into 
warring tribes again. Now the larger 
communist-backed Shona tribe (led by 
Prime Minister Mugabe) is exterminating 
the smaller pro-Western Ndebele tribe 
(led by Joshua Nkomo), in a mass 
genocide. 

Tribal rivalry and strife already exist 
in South Africa among the six or more 
major tribes .. If the whites were 
overthrown, a black majority government 
would, in all likelihood, soon 
disintergrate into a bloody battle 
between the tribes. The resulting 
carnage would be unrivaled in recent 
histOry. 

As I see it, there is no logical, 
practical alternative to slow but positive 
change through the step-by-step repeal 
of the offensive apartheid laws . America 
may continue to vocalize its moral 
abhorrence to the apartheid system but, 
as John C. Eastman, research associate 
with the Claremont Institute for the 
Study of Statemenship and Political 
Philosophy in Claremont says, "More 
investment, not less, will produce greater 
economic equality, and thus greater 
pressure on the government of South 
Africa for political equality as well. And 
what is more, the reform that would 
then be forthcoming would have been 
achieved within South Africa, and not at 
the hands of a United States 
government seeking, nay demanding, 
adherence 10 the same principles, and 
to the same degree, to which we 
ourselves adhere." And in the end , do 
we really adhere to them completely 
ourselves?

Shooting 
~ CONtlNUED FROM PAGE 3( 
jumped through 'a plate glass window 
'intO a bedroom. Stinson fired a dart 
from the stun gun at him but missed, 
and Holden began to move roward him. 
The owner of the house, Bill Ballard, Jr., 
entered the room and Red the house 
once he saw Holden's knife and the 
officers standing outside his window. 

According to Ybarrondo, Holden 
started running after the owner, and 
Stinson fired one round from his .38-
caliber revolver. Officer Carl Smith, who 
was called to the scene with Stinson, 
fired five rounds from his service 
revolver at Holden. 

"After the owner took off, Holden 
turned and immediately ran toward the 
door with the knife poised over him. 
The olJicers feared for the resident and 
fired ," Ybarrondo said. 

All six bullets struck Holden, TWO in 
his back, one in his rib cage, one in his 
buttocks, and one in both the ann and 
leg. Ybarrondo defended die olJicers' 
actions, saying that they sensed a threat 
to the owner and were justified in using 
ample force in stopping Holden. 

"This was a life-and-death situation, 
and they fired at him until he fell to the 
Roor, which is what they are trained to 
do: Ybarrondo said. 

Both officers have been taken off 
active duty pending the outcome of an 
internal investigation, an action taken 
whenever an officer is involved in a 
shooting. 

According to Holden's father, who 
was on the scene and now plans on 
filing a legal suit against the police 
department. there was no reason why 
the police had to use such excessive 
force. He said there were eight police 
officers equipped with buBet-proof vestS 
and the Stun gun against his 110 lb. 
son, who was only threatening to do 
harm to himself. 

"It was totany unjustified-it was 
murder-they had no reason to kiD 
him ," his father said . "The police in San 

Di~ have been doing this stuff for 
years, and they're not going to get away 
with it anymore." 

Apparently, Holden's reaction to the 
police olJicers was prompted by an 
incident that occurred three weeks ago 
when he was Arrested after contesting 
an officer's right to request 
identification. 

According to Holden's father, Wayne 
and his girlfriend were pulled over for 
having a burned-oUl headlight. and 
when the officers discovered that 
Holden's eyes were somewhat red, they 
asked for identification. Holden gave it 
to them but protested that it was a 
violation of his rights. 

His verbal complaints mushroomed 
when the officer accidently tore the ID, 
and the inclctent ended in Hoiderfs 

AS budget nteeting 
The 5500,000 AS Council budget deliberations extended late into 

Wednesday night. Issues discussed included media budgeting, 
programming (including TGIFs), budgeting for AS student organizations, 
and other financial plans for the coming academic year. 

Among the controversial topics were a proposal to cap spending by any 
of the student newspapers at 25% of the alternative media budget, a "new 
service" food service ,a 538,000 allocation for KSOT and an S8,OOO 
alternative media typesetter amortization aDocation. 

For a full account of the results of the meeting, see Monday'S issue of the 
Guardian. 

~mst under the charge of obstructing 
an olJicer in the line of duty. The case 
was scheduled to come up on June 10. 

Holden apparently had a " .0 grade 
point average at UCSD during the two 
years he attended and was a very bright 
and compassionate man, according to 
Gale Vigliotti of the Philosophy 
Department. 

") had just talked to him a few times 
last week and he seemed as fine as 

THINK 

ever," Vigliotti said. "It's a real real shock 
to all of us. I just don't understand what 
really happened." 

Yborrondo said that the investigation 
into the shooting will continue. 

Memorial services for Holden will be 
held on Sunday at 2:30 pin at the San 
Diego Unitarian FeDowship in Solana 
Beach. His father expressed his wishes 
that all those who knew him would 
attend. ~

Whose tragic flaw? 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOlE, PerspeClivfS Editor 

W HE A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED tragedy strikes a member of our UC D community, fellow 
friends , students and professors often 
cannot reconcile the discrepancies 
between the official account of the event 
and their personal knowledge of the 
victim. The headline of the LA Times 
yesterday read , "Knife Wielding UCSD 
Srudent Slain by Police ." For Jim 
Crosswhite, lecturer in the Literature 
Depanment and acting director of the 
Warren College Writing Program, the 
brief public record of UCSD philosophy 
undergraduate Wayne Holden did not 
match the description of the student he 
had known for more than two years. 
"When I first began to read the LA 
Times anicle, I recalled immediately 
three weeks ago when he came in to 
complain about his encounter with the 
police," said Crosswhite. "I couldn't 
belive it had come to this." 

Crosswhite was accustomed to 
Holden dropping by his office, even 
though Holden had only taken one 
course from him. "He clearly was a 
student who wanted more from his 
education than JUSt a future job. After he 
completed the Warren Writing lOA 
course, he would drop by my olTice 
every two weeks or so to ask that I help 
him go over a recent paper he was 
writing. He was more interested in our 
intellectual exchange than the papers 
themselves. 

"I always knew Wayne to be level-
hea.ded and self-controlled, at least up 
untIl three weeks ago after police 
allegedly roughed him up fOT obsrructing 
an officer In the performance of his 
duty," said Crosswhite. The previous 
encounter with the police happened 
over an eqUipment violation on the car 

of his girlfriend, Mary Anewalt . They 
,":ere pulled over for a faulty taillight and 
cited. Soon afterwards a second police 
unit stopped them for the same 
violation. As Anewalt explained to one 
officer that they had JUSt been informed 
of the violation, a second officer asked 
Holden to srep out of the car and 
submit to a search on suspicion of drug 
possession. Holden and Anewalt told 
the officers they had just been fighting 
and Holden's red eyes were a resuh of 
crying. The second olTicer asked to see 
Holden's license , and while returning 
the hcense allegedly aCCidentally tore it. 
Holden was arrested when he protested 
what he felt to be a hostile action. Later, 
Holden told Crosswhite the officer 
struck him while he was in the police 
unit. "Wayne seemed naive to me on 
this point. It was if no one had hit him 
before. He was shocked at the fact the 
police had hit him. He was shaken that 
day, and it was hard for me to get the 
full story from him . That was the last 
time I saw Wayne." 

Crosswhite reflected back on the 
years before the first police encounter 
and yesterday's events that ended in 
Holden's death by six police bullets. "He 
was originally an engineering student. 
He turned to philosophy because it 
meant more to him. He would always 
come to the office with some new idea. 
One day Wayne came to me with some 
good ideas on how to improve the 
Warren Writing Program." 

Holden stood out in Crosswhite's 
min? be~ause of his unique approach to 
studies. I remember in the last several 
months he wanted to talk on Hegel for a 
philosophy paper. The paper staned off 
shon in the first draft and then it got 
longer as he tried to clarify the

philosophical ideas. I considered it 
unusual for an undergraduate to take on 
Hegel in this depth . That is what always 
drew my ancntion to him." 

Crosswhite and Holden developed a 
bond because of common interests. "He 
kept coming back to my office for two 
years because he knew 1 was a Santa 
Cruz undergraduate like himself and 
that I was writing my dissenation in 
philosophy." Holden withdrew from 
UCSD during this quaner in preparation 
for his return to Santa Cruz, where he 
planned to finish his degree . 

After many discussi~ns, Crosswhite 
began to know Holden's method of 
thinking, "He was Socratic. More than 
either being right himself or being 
corrected by someone else, he wanted to 
engage in a philosophical dialogue. He 
wasn't hesitant to give in on a point, if 
he could see that he was wrong. But he 
was not the type to back down if he 
believed he was right" Holden told 
Crosswhite he felt the police had 
VIolated his rights by searching his 
person for drugs when there was no 
probable cause. 

Holden's philosophical approach 10 
life went outside the classroom and into 
the anti-apanheid rallies. "He was 
seriously involved in the 
demonstrations. He used his quick wit 
to lighten the pressure of a heated 
conversation. He was good natured with 

the other students in class and a little 
more earnest about improving his 
writing." 

To Crosswhite, Holden's personality 
changed after the first police encounter. 
"The Wayne I saw then was afraid of 
the police; that is why he ran." Holden's 
father had called the 911 emergency 
number asking for medical assistance to 
help subdue his son after his 
unsuccessful attempts that lasted several 
hours. Crosswhite knew Holden's 
developed ability to be reasoned with. 
"It is hard for me to believe eight police 
officers and one Wayne Holden could 
not have come to some other terms than 
shooting him six times." At present, 
repons are conllicting as to what threat 
Holden was to the police. "He was a 
very small person in height and weight 
rHO Ibsl, cenainly not of threarening 
stature," said Crosswhite, who could not 
recall Holden ever confronting another 
individual. "If I had been there, I would 
have had no reservations about driving 
up and asking him to get into my car 10 
dISCUSS what was bothering him." 

Finally, Crosswhite asked a question 
many of Holden's friends, fellow 
students and teachers may be asking 
themselves right now: "I wonder what it 
felt like 10 be shot six times." ~

"U h t th Â· ']" m ... u ... can you repea e questIon. 
By PHIL lAUDER 

I '\IE BEEN TO THREE WEDDINGS in my lifetime. One was my parents' in 1970; I was six years old, so I don't 
remember a whole lot about the thing. 
All I know is what I see in the wedding 
album that gets dragged out every five 
years or so. In those photos I see a 
stupid little kid dressed in a black velvet 
suit holding a little white pillow for 
who-knows-what purpose . I also see 
relatives the way they looked 15 years 
ago. I laugh. 

The second wedding I attended was a 
couple years ago, the wedding of the 
former editor of this paper. His was an 
outdoor wedding- very nice and very 
cool, but not all that traditional; it didn't 
give me a real taste of the full-on , sit-
down , drag-out, let's-go-to-the-church 
kind of wedding. 

The weekend before last I attended 
wedding number three , and this one 
did give me a taste of what the more 
traditional variety is like. Scary stuff, I 
tell you. 

I'm friends with the bride, whom I 
met at m)' bank three years ago. Barb is 
a very lovely lady of 27, and this is her 
second marriage-and last , she swears. 
She's now wedded to an Air Force 
lieutenant from Arizona, which is now 
her home state, and away they go to live 
happily ever after. They probably Just 
gOt back from the honeymoon in Hawaii 
tQday. 

But to get to Hawaii they first had to 
survive their wedding. Without freaking 
out. 

One has to be a pile of nerves before 
one's wedding. There's no way around 
it:"-except through drugs, and I'm not 
sure I'd want to be a waste case at my 
wedding. First of all, you have to 
remember and perform a 'ceremony

before a live audience-not JUSt any live 
audience, but one comprised of 100 or 
so of the best friends you and your 
spouse-to-be have. This is the most 
imponant ceremony you're ever going to 
go through, and unless you're Elizabeth 
Taylor, you ain't getting a second or 
third or eighth chance. And you know 
you're going to blow something. "And 
will you, Barb, take Greg to be your 
lawfully [as opposed to unlawfully] 
wedded husband, to honor and cherish 
and blahblahblah .... Answer now 'I 
will.'" "Urn ... uh ... can you repeat the 
question?" 

It isn't just the getting up in front of 
everyone for your bit that is going 10 
make you nervous. Every little detail 
about the event has been planned and 
hashed out and sweated over for 
sleepless nights on end. The fancy quill 
pen for signing the guest book beller 
not run Out of ink. The cloth runner 
that goes down the cemer aisle for the 
bride to s troll upon better not have a rip 
in it. The candles at the front of the 
church better light when they're 
supposed 10, dammil. The Singer better 
not get laryngitis, and better not be 
tone-deaf. The organist better not be a 
boozer. Same for the minister. At the 
reception , the caterers better not spill 
anything on anyone , and there better as 
hell be enough food . The groom's 
brother better not get too sauced before 
he announces the toast. The cake better 
nor collapse under its own weight (or 
anyone else's, for that matter). And on 
and on and on. If anything goes wrong, 
the whole thing becomes a fiasco in the 
couple 's eyes. There's a commercial for 
some car company where it stans 
raining at Daddy's little girl's wedding 
reception, and the music dies and 

everyone stans taking off, and the bride 
falls into hysteriCS because her 
wedding's ruined . That has to be every 
couple's worst fears in living color. 
Fonunately, Daddy saves the day by 
offering everyone rides home in the 
torrential downpour, and the music 
continues. 1 hope my daddy owns a 
Subaru on my wedding day. 

The amount of planning that has to 
go into one of these things is almost 
mind-boggling. When to get married, 
what to wear, where the wedding will 
be , where the reception will be, who's 
performing the ceremony, who's catering 
it and what exactly will be catered, what 
the invitations are going to say and how 
fancily they're going to say it, who will 
be invited in the first place, who will be 
the best man and the maid of honor, 
what kind of music will be played , 
who's going to play it and/ or sing it , 
how religiOUS (or sexist) will the text be 
that each panner says to the other, who 
will hake what kind of wedding cake, 
what kind of guest book and fancy quill 
pen will be found, what kind of runner 
on the floor will be bought, and, of 
course, how in hell are we going to pay 
for all this garbage? 

It amazes me how much of these 
ceremonies is dictated by tradition. 
Everything's tradition. The guests arrive , 
the guests sign the guestbook, the 
organist plays, the bridesmaids waltz 
down the aisle followed by Dad and the 
bride, the bride meets the groom, the 
priest or minister or whoever comes out 
and goes through a spiel j the bride and 
groom say "I will" and kiss, the music 
plays and they walk up the aisle. Then 
it's off to the reception, where a few 
things have to happen: presents are 
brought, food is served, the couple is 

toasted , a bouquet is tossed, a ganer belt 
is removed and tossed , and people take 
pictures. 

One tradition I'd never heard of 
before Barb's wedding involves the 
wedding cake. The two cut the cake 
together-fine. And then they each take 
a piece-and they're encouraged to 
smash it all over each other's faces ! 
That's terrible! Who the hell staned that 
tradition? Here it is, a happy, fine day, 
the sun is shining, the birds are singing, 
the flowers are blooming-it'S a day for 
two people to stan the rest of their lives 
together, and they're supposed to stan it 
off by tricking each other and grinding 
cake into each other'S face . I don't get it. 
If my wife tries that with me. it's all 
over-"Is there a lawyer in the house?" 
Maybe we'll get to the cake part before 
we exchange the vows, just _in case. 

* * * 
During the next few years many of us 

are gomg to watch with amazement as 
one by one our friends drop off the 
bachelor or bachelorette list and head 
into the wide weird world of matrimony. 
Some of these people we'd never expect 
to wed; they're too loose or too free or 
toO aloof or too anti-social or too flat-out 
strange to ever get married , and yet they 
WIll. And so Will you. Not all of you. 
Some of you-most of you, in fact. Like 
it or not. 

At Barb's reception 1 sat at a table 
with her banking friends-paired off in 
couples, two of them married, one of 
them about to be. And then they looked 
at me, with "You next. kid?" in their 
eyes. Hey, don't look at me, man. I ain't 
getting married for a few decades, OK? 
Leave me alone. 

They laughed. ~

Pat Powtrs led the USA to victory in a 
five-game thnller Tuesday night In the gym. 

By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 
"W HE WE ARE FORCED 

to play harder, the game 
feels like slow motion," 

said Pat Powers of the USA Men 's 
Volleyball Team. "You're able to see 
more of the game as your peripheral 
vision widens and depth of field 
expands." Powers helped demonstrate to 
the audience who witnessed Tuesday 

I MMEDIATELY FOLLOWING Sunday'S 34-poim mutilation of the Los Angeles Lakers counesy of the 
colorless Celtics of Boston . basketball 
fans. writers and commentators began 
questioning the mental toughness of 
West Coast basketball teams. If Sunday's 
game was any indication of the 
durability of the Laker ballclub , then this 
analysis will properly be answered in 
the next two weeks. For the LA Lakers 
dream team has its back set firmly 
against the wall . with the only way to 
unattach itself being a storming 
comeback. 

Yes, the senes IS seven games long. 
Yes, the Boston Garden is what the 
emire concept of home team advantage 
is a ll about. Sure , the Celtics played 
possibly their best game ever. Hell, 
Dutch Boy Scott Wedman was 11 for 11 
from the field , including four three-
pointers. Dainty Danny Ainge made 
nine of 15 attempts while completely 
shutting down a much quicker Byron 
Scon. "The Chief," Robert Parish , ran the 
all-time great cemer Kareem up and 
down the court like a freIght train 
tugging an old , wheezing caboose. At 
one memorable point In the second 
quarter. Parish burst ahead of Abdul-
Jabbar at midcourt, took a Larry Bird 
pass down the paint, casually turned his 
head to grimace at Kareem , and 

USA vs. Cuba, round two 

Depth perception 
night's rematch between USA and Cuba 
that the new post-Olympic gold medal 
team has the depth of ability to stage a 
comeback that was reminiscent of the 
USA victory over the Brazilians in the 
finals of the Games. Even though the 
Cubans won the first twO games (their 
first victories in three matches of this 
US tour), the spikes and blocks of Pat 
Powers kept the scores close enough for 
the USA to regroup and moum a 
comeback. 

Powers admitted that the USA had 
not expected the less experienced 
Cuban team to tighten up enough to 
handle the attack of the American 
armada that had sunk the Cuban spirits 
with devastating victories In Santa 
Barbara and here at UCSD Sunday. 
"They started to run the middle like we 
haven't seen them do since before the 
Games. And their serves fired across the 
net." said Powers. The hook serve of 
Cuban Abel Sarmientos and leaping 
smashes of Eugenio Oniz cleared the 
two-inch tape at the top of the net that 
had seemed lik6 an impenetrable US 
boarder crossing in earlier games, 
resulting In a quick 7-2 Cuban lead in 
the first game. USA team captain Karch 
Kiraly and Cuban Leonardo Silie 
sprayed spikes to all corners of the 
coun as the teams traded scores to 
reach 10-7. For a moment the Cubans 
became disorganized and the 
Olympians' comeback looked like the 
beginning of another rout. The Cuban 
middle broke when Powers began his 
two-game stellar performance, narrowing 
the margin to 13-12. Now it was Powers 
and the Cuban servers trading sideouts, 
but the Cubans were dug in and 
determined not to lose this one. Their 
15-13 victory alened everyone that they 
had their own form of power. 

Like an Indy driver, Powers turned on 
his turbo boost with driving spikes to 
live up to his reputation as the most 
overpowering hitter In the Olympics, 
during which he taDied 103 kills in 176 

swings. The Cubans seemed to be 
victims of stun guns with every shot 
from Powers. Silie was not to be . 
outdone by this power serve, keeping 
the score even through the first eight 
points. The excitement of the moment 
could be seen on the two benches, 
where both sides' players were on their 
feet constantly warming up for their 
turns as replacement baners. Like a 
grounding wire , the Cubans dug into 
the ground to dissipate Powers' energy 
surges, resulting in a five-pOint spread, 
14-9. Powers came on again, directing 
his spikes deeper into the Cuban coun 
and pulling USA back to 14-13. From 
that deep baseline the Cubans retaliated 
through their serves, ending the second 
game 15-13. 

As the third game opened. one could 
feel the sweaty palms of the audience. 
Did the new Men 's USA Team have 
depth beyond their returning Olympic 
five? That question was quickly 
answered with the first three USA 
points. And the audience answered with 
its approval by turning up the volume of 
cheers. Maybe someone told the USA 
team that ABC Television was recording 
the entire event on twO tripod cameras. 

ow the USA men began playing to a 
larger audience, their public beyond the 
gym walls of UCSD. 

Very poor officiating marred the USA 
performance. Often the head referee 
failed to acknowledge his linesmen's red 
flags. Finally, the USA coach had some 
words with the official, and the local 
favoritism was removed . 

Rallies of ten to 20 spikes per side 
sparked the atmosphere as both Powers 
and Kiraly set fire to the entire team. 
The Cubans held on up to 5-4, but the 
current was too much for them to 
handle. Down 12-5. the Cubans tried to 
pick up their spirits by performing a 
Harlem Globetrotter weave that 
delighted the audience. Maybe it was 
the USA comeback, maybe the antics of 
the Cubans, but whatever it was, the 

Mid -series preview 
An analysis of the Lakers/ Ceities clash 

By MATTHEW]. CRONIN 
rammed the ball home with two hands. 
So much for age intimidation. 

The rest of the Laker club was about 
as shellshocked as the Big Man . Magic 
Johnson hesitated 10 drive down the 
lane all game, thereby nullifying any 
chance for open shots. James Worthy 
played like a man possessed . but was 
overmatched by Bird and Lurch McHale 
inSide . Wonhy, who owns one of the 
quickest turnaround jumpers in the 
NBA, was cleanly rejected by McHale 
early in the second quaner to the astonish -
ment of many Laker fans . Although Lurch's 
arms hang below his ankles. Wonhy's 
jumping ability far exceeds thaI of the 
cement-footed McHale, and no one 
expects Kevin to go on inruition. 

A look at the matCh-Ups might paint a 
dearer picture of how the rest of the 
series will go: 
CENTERS 

Kareem Abdul Jabbar (Lakers) vs. 
Roben 'The Chief' Parish (Celtics) 

Forget Kareem 's early foul Irouble 

Sunday; he is a winner with great 
determination and finesse . The Chief 
might be able to oudeg him , but a 
guaranteed better shooling percentage 
by the Lakers in tonight'S game will 
severely cut down on the Cehics' 
fastbreak opponunities. Parish , though , 
thoroughly outdueled Moses Malone in 
the Philadelphia massacre , and has 
improved hiS inside game immensely. 
Fmally, remember how badly Kareem 
wants thIS championshIp. EDGE: 
IJakers. 
POWER FORWARDS 

Kun Rambis, Bob McAdoo, Larry 
Spri~ (Lakers) vs. 

Kevin McHale, Cornbread Maxwell 
(Celtics) 

A big advantage to the Celtics here, as 
none of the Lakers can touch either the 
grizzled veteran Maxwell or the master 
McHale on defense. OITensively, Bobby 
can pop eratically and Rambis will get 
junk hoops oIT the offensive boards, but 
McHale will average at lea 51 18 poims a 

attitude of all people in the gym seemed 
to have changed from that of an 
international confrontation to a 
crossr.own rivalry. Someone unfurled a 
six-foot Cuban flag in the audience, and 
for one moment UCSD became the 
Olympics. 

The sense of slow motion for the USA 
players must have come to a standstill, 
as they set up and spiked fasrer than 
the Cubans could handle. The game 
frantically expanded beyond the 
sidelines as the audience made way for 
players diving up to the third row for a 
dig. Drained after so many spikes in the 
first three games, both teams turned the 
founh game into a net blocking 
demonstration by the blocking brothers 
of Craig Buck and Ralph Smith . Time 
stopped for everyone after the score 
reached 13-9 USA. For 20 minutes 
sideouts were the nature of the game. 
Everyone in the gym wondered if the 
USA could break away from the Cuban 
grip. Then suddenly, in less than one 
minute , the USA came up with three 
spectacular spikes and evened the 
match. 

Before the final game began , people 
throughout the gym were removing their 
coats and swearers, hoping to cool oIT 
after the first four games. They should 
have kept their shins on for the night 
air. though. as the USA team quickly 
doused any hopes the Cubans might 
have hail of rekindling the fires of their 
first two games. Kiraly dropped depth 
charges on every Cuban digger, breaking 
their concentration and team 
coordination . The Cubans came up from 
the deep with their first point at 5-1 , 
then sunk down again. 11-5. As if to 
prepare the Cubans for their next match 
in rainy Ponland, the USA flooded the 
Cubans, 15-6. 

While signing autographs , USA 
captain Kiraly said the closeness of the 
second match resulted from both teams 
learning from each other and respecti~ 
each other's talent. Ii:jJ 

game for the series. Cornbread is hun, 
Spriggs is too inexperienced, and the 
Celtics work the baD bener insIde. 
EDGE: ultics. 
SMALL FORWARDS 

James Wonhy (Lakers) vs. 
Larry Bird, Scon Wedman (Celtics) 

First off, Larry Bird is not exactly a 
small forward; it's just that most teams 
are forced to match up with him as a 
small forward . Wonhy may be the besr 
player in the league in a few years once 
Pat Riley figures out how to exploit his 
talents, but for now Btrd is the beSt 
forward in the league. Although Worthy 
can score over him , Bird will match his 
point total with ease. Just thinking about 
the other aspects of Bird's game is 
enough, but if Scon Wedman continues 
his torrid shooting pace, this series 
could be over early. EDGE: ultics. 
POINT GUARDS 

Magic Johnson. Michael Cooper 
(Lakers) vs. 

Dennis Johnson. Quinn Buckner 
(Celtics) 

So, Magic chokes? WeD. he has had a 
few off days in his six-year career, but 
the man dots not take the apple. If there 
is one person who can win this series 
for the West Coast, it's Magic . OJ 
defenses Magic better than anyone else

Lakers/ Celts 
< CONTINUED FRON PAGE 12< 
in the NBA, but he will tire when the 
series switches back to LA. Cooper is a 
superlative defensive player and a great 
asset on the fastbreak. Neither OJ nor 
Buckner is much of a threat offensively, 
nor very quick, but they are savvy. 
EDGE: Lakers. 
SHOOTING GUARDS 

Byron Scott, Mike McGee (Lakers) vs. 
Danny Ainge, Ranting Ray Williams 

(Celtics) 
The'addition of the Knickerbocker 
refugee Williams and Ainge's newfound 
confidence 10 the Celtic lineup has 
made the team that much better than 
last year's championship club. Ainge 's 
outside shot is not as pure as Byron's. 
His court awareness is much greater, 
though , which balances Scon's edge in 
speed. McGee and Ray match up fairly 
evenly also, but give the nose to 
Williams if only for experience. EDGE: 
Even. 

If the Lakers win tonight, then they 
have a good chance to capture the 
series, as they should take twO out of 
three in Los Angeles and have the 
ability to win another in Boston. If not, 
you can count on another banner to be 
hung from the rusty rafters of Boston 
Garden. Think now of pride. Celtic and 
Laker pride. For that will determine the 
winner in this championship of 
immense pressure. Say hello to 
Hollywood . ~

BUD LIGHT 
MAY 

Athlete of the Month 

JESSICA VERNON 
Women's Tennis 

Vernon, a 5-7 senior from San Diego, 
played a major role in the T ritons' 
road to success in this year's NCAA 
Division III Women's Tennis 
Championship. A three-year starter 
for coach Liz laPlante, Vernon won 
two of her three matches as the Tritons 
defeated Trenton State 5-1, Principia 
College 5-4 and Davidson 8-1 en route 
to their first-ever team tennis tide. In 
individual play, Vernon won three 
straight and advanced to the semi-
finals before losing 2-6, 6-4, 1-6 to the 
tournament's eventual individual 
tidest, Courtney Allen of Principia 
College. Vernon finished the year with 
a 23-9 record. 
But the highlight of Vernon's 
performance at the nationals came in 
doubles play when she teamed with 
fellow senior Nadine Akimoto to win 
the doubles title. Vernon and 
Akimoto concluded their season with 
a school-record 23-6 record. 

Two of UC San Diego's more 
talen ted athletes, Jessica 
Vernon and Pat Wei shan, 
played major roles in helping 
their respective teams gain 
national prominence during the 
1985 spring athletic season. As 
a result, Vernon and Weishan 
have been tabbed as UCSD's 
Co-Athletes of the Month , for 
May. 

PATWEISHAN 
Men's Golf 

(no p/w<o aw,kJble) 
Weishan, a 5-10 sophomore from EI 
Cajon, turned in what may have been 
one of the school's better "clutch" 
performances in this year's NCAA 
Division III Championship 
Tournament. Weishan, a 1984 AlI-
American, trailed by six strokes 
entering the fi nal round, trailing Bryon 
Goldsworthy of Central (Iowa) 
College. After 17 holes, Weishan still 
trailed by three strokes on the final 
hole of the tournament. Sinking a 
twisting 17 -footer for a birdie, 
Wdshan soon found himself in a 
sudden-death playoff when 
Goldsworthy double-bogeyed the 
same hole a few seconds later. 
Weishan lost a chanceatthe title when 
Goldsworthy birdied the second hole 
of the playoff, compared to Weishan 's 
par effort. Weishan led the T r irons to 
a second-place finish in the 
tournament, the highest finish by any 
Tri ton golf team.

LA MACHINE 
Men's A Ultimate Disc Champs 

Once a machine always a machine. Yes, folks , the lads from LA 
MACHINE have done it again with another sterling 1M performance. 
This time around it was the wacky world of Ultimate Disc as Brian Evans, 
Stooey and Looey Matt and the rest of the boys did another number on 
the best UCSD has to offer . 
In an incredible week. La Machine knocked off Sigma Nu 15-3, 
Skyrnaster 14-7, and you know who (SWAMP) 13-8 to annex their first 
Ultimate championship. 
It 's another Miller Lite High Five to the best rookie disc catchers on 
campus ... La Machine.

Familiet: Babiea ' 

I may be 22, but I feel like I'm 17. 
How can people my age have 'kids? 
I'm still in school, have a parHime 
job at $4lhour, drink too much 
beer, smoke too much reefer and 
masturbate regularly. 

How is it that people my age are 
married and getting each other 
pregnant on purpose? 

My stomach was a bit queasy 
today. 

I had to ride back to school on the 
Greyhound. The nausea was part of a 
vague depression brought on by a 
remorseful hangover. I thought the 
bus driver was too stern when he 
told that Mexican woman with the 
two kids she'd have to sit them both 
on her lap or pay for another ticket. 

I didn't really feel like throwing 
up, but I played out the scene in my 

.' 

The comings and 
goings of mother 
head of how I'd have to stumble by 
the little boy in the aisle~seat while 
everyone stared at me lunging for the 
rest room. 

Rows of artichokes spun by like 
helicopter blades and I missed my 
brother, my sisters and Frances. 
Usually 1 don't miss Frances. I've 
trained myself not to. The last long 
distance relationship I was in ended 
with six months of stomach~urdling 
longing and begging; beating my 
head agail\4t a wall that was never 
going to love me again. Those pangs 
were back again. Once your body 

....... ' ~ .. 

gets used to a certain pain, it can 
recall it in an instant with the proper 
stimulus. 

.The waves on a calm ocean surface 
bob and sink like they don't know 
the difference between the two. The 
ocean absorbs the comings and 
goings like a great somber mother. 

Surface~Bumps trade places with the 
Great Depths so fluidly, so 

effortlessly, it's difficult to separate 
them. 

The little waves have no skin. 
I have always had a bad 

complexion. I've tried to think of my 
pimples as small parts of my physical 
body reaching out into the cosmos, 
but I usually 5quee%e these ambitious 
bumps as soon as I can get to a ' 
mirror. Everyone has their burden to 
carry; I just wear mine on my face.

tGoing in Circles" with a 
half man/half goose Â· 

David Keevil'. perfQlll\ance 
event next Wednesday at Sushi is the 
result of a sculptor who can .ing and 
dance. 

For years Keevil has sensed, in his 
work, the precarious line of 
potential movement never quite 
realized. He wanta movement to 
become a part of hit work. Keevil 
also feels the audience has been 
separated too long from art and the 
artist. With these two conaider~ 
ationa in mind, he turned to 
performance; a media within which 
he could incorporate his sculpturea, 
and the audience, into one work. 

Keevtl is collaborating with his 
brother, Christopher, a traditional . 
country dance caller, to create 
simultaneously a piece of art and 
entertainment. While Christopher 
calls the shots, David and several 
students will perform circle dances 
and songs centering around seven 
large sculptures. All audience 
members will be invited to dance the 
folk dances, becoming a part of the 
piece. 

The sculptures are the sometimes 

surreal, sometime. cynical, 
allegories for the progression of our 
livea through birth, life and death. 
David himself is symbolized by a half 
gooeelhalf man creature made of 
chiclten wire and hot glue: with a 
latex akin. The goose is a two--way 
symbol, of man's ability to fly In his 
head but not in his body, and of the 
tamed animal mentality created In 
children by their parents. This 
character progreuea through the 
circle dancea, interacting with the 
sculptures, each repreoentinl a 
different stage in the developing 
personal and social conaciousneu of 
an individual. 

. Keevtl describes his work as both 
enllghteniRil and fun and indeed, 
hand in hand with the serious themes 
of the sculptures is their whimsical 
appearance. "I like building things 
kind of dumb," he says. colt's like 
leaving a fingerprint on your work." 

"Going in Circles" will be 
perforft\ed one time only on 
Wednesday, June 5, at 8 pm. There 
will be a $5 adm~ion charge for 
non-members, $3 ror members. 

now, the scars have remained. Pock~ 
marked people are always depicted 
in the movies as being deranged and 
sinister. There's good reason for 
this: those who have spent their 
adolescence burdened with pimples 
get mean and angry at the world. 

I try not to wish I had smooth 
skin; my brain is boxed in a skull. 
Both of these casings have holes big 
enough for my mind to see, but too 
small for me to get out. 

When I hold Fran's naked body I 
want to somehow unzip her and 
crawl inside. My tongue can venture 
in her mouth and my cock can push a 
little bit inside her torso, but always 
I'm left out. 

We sleep like hermits under the 
covers. Then I go home. 

Through these sockets, through 
the tinted glass of the bus window, I 
look at the pitiful cows, ignorant of 
their fandes, who pass me by. 

I want to hold a warm baby in my 
belly. 1 want to be a warm baby in my 
belly. Soft bodily fluids would ooze 
inside and outside of my curled 
form, enveloped by my flesh, just 
like a wheel within a wheel.

Harlem's just another planet 
'Brother' is a 
witty new film 

By MARIE BOZZETTI 
John Sayles is one of America's 

most talented independent 
filmmakers, having been responsible 
for such films as Retum 0/ the 
Seacaucus Sa!en, Lianna and Baby It's 
Yau, the last major studio release. 
Now, he returns to the independent 
film in The Brother From Another 
Planet, which was written, edited and 
directed by Sayles. In the movie, he 
demonstrates a remarkable 
propensity for dialogue, as shrewd 
cultural observations abound in his 
brilliant script. 

The film begins when an alien 
black brother crash,lands onto Ellis 
Island. This extraterrestrial emigre 
leads the viewer on an adventurous 
journey through the never,never 
land of Harlem. The brother, 
portrayed engagingly by Joe Morton, 
is distinguished from the native 
inhabitants by his ignorance of social 
convention and his inability to 
speak. Furthermore, his power to 
heal wounds, rejuvenate limbs and 
magically repair video games validate 
his alien status. 

In Harlem the brother encounters 
a plethora of characters representing 
varied echelons of society. Black 
patrons at a neighborhood bar, 
employees of a video arcade, a 
rastafarian and a beautiful has,been 
nightclub singer are numbered 
among the variety of Harlemites he 
encounters. 

Reminiscent of Spielberg 's E. T., 

this extraterrestrial garners 
confidence and support from his 
earthly brothers and sisters. Using 
the brother as a catalyst, Sayles 
allows the characters to confide in 
him, permitting an intimate glimpse 
into their lives. Racial prejudice, 
social injustice and drug abuse are 
examined through the eyes of 
Morton's character. His ability to 
record the emotional impact of 
Harlem's daily life provides a vital 
component of the film. 

Why is this extraterrestrial 
brother wandering the streets of 
Harlem? The other worldy being is 

an escaped slave trying vainly to 
avoid the vigilantes sent to capture 
him. Humorously portrayed as 
black,clad mirror,images of 
themselves, the vigilantes slither 
through Harlem trying to track him 
down. Cornball movements coupled 
with a confused grasp of the English 
language compose an entertaining 
characterization of the evil force. 
When the bounty hunters order a 
drink at the neighborhood bar, they 
request beer on the rocks, while 
exhibiting bizarrely choreographed 
movements. This prompts an elderly 
patron to comment, "The (white

The Brother From Another Planet is 
a refreshingly perceptive urban fairy 
tale, with Harlem as the 
contemporary land of Oz. It is a 
journey through the eccentric, once 
glorious, kingdom of Harlem. This 
film succeeds as an unconventional 
saga of city life. It reveals the best and 
worst of urban living. The brother is 
our guide, a modern Alice or 
Dorothy leading the viewer through 
the yellow brick road of American 
society-a Wonderland in 
transition.
