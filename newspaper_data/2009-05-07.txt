Outgoing A.S. Council 
reconsiders, rejects 
motion to shut down 
indebted cafe.

By Reza Farazmand
News Editor

After weeks of intense delibera-tion that consumed two A.S. Council meetings and drew 
impassioned response from dozens 
of concerned students, the drawn-out 
Grove Caffe debate came to an end last 
night after the council voted to keep 
the eatery’s doors open indefinitely. 

At the 2008-09 council’s final meet-
ing, cafe advocates and opponents 
argued over the Grove’s role as a stu-

dent enterprise, the value of its 24-year 
history on campus and the risks associ-
ated with allowing the cafe to remain 
open into next year. 

Currently over $120,000 in debt, the 
Grove has been a point of contention 
among councilmembers since becom-
ing a fully student-owned enterprise 
in 2007. 

Following nearly three hours of 
discussion, the council voted nine in 
favor and 12 against a piece of legisla-

Students will be able to pro-
test the proposed UC education and 
registration fee increases over the 
phone today, directly before the UC 
Board of Regents meet via tele-
conference. The regents� canceled a 
visit to UCSD to avoid distracting 
campus officials from fighting the 
swine-flu virus outbreak. 

The 20-minute student and 
public comment period will occur 
at 9:30 a.m. today in Price Center 
Ballroom B.

Student opposition to the sys-
temwide $626-per-quarter increase 
in systemwide educational fees and 
$36 increase in registration fees is 
largely based on concerns that the 
university has not created a long-
term policy for regulating student 
fees. 

UC Students Association 
President Lucero Chavez, a UC 
Berkeley graduate student, said stu-
dents need to know that fees won’t 
rise again when making plans for 
the future. 

Associated Students Vice 
President of External Affairs Lisa 
Chen said she was disappointed by 

the regents’ decision to cancel their 
campus meeting.

“It has completely changed our 
plans,” Chen said. “We’ve been 
mobilizing students for this meet-
ing and now they’re taking student 
speakers for only 20 minutes.”

The scratched two-day meeting 
budgeted time for several rounds 
of students and workers to address 
the regents.

Student fees have increased by 
107 percent� over the last seven 
years. 

Campus Organizing Director for 
A.S. External Affairs Gracelynne 
West argued that middle-class stu-
dents who do not receive financial 
aid will be the hardest hit, because 
— as fees continue to increase —
they won’t have anything to protect 
them.

“We are addressing and exposing 
the lies of the regents,” West said. 
“It is definitely a problem affect-
ing low-income and middle-class 
UC students. For those that don’t 
receive financial aid, it’s a burden. 
It’s becoming harder for students to 
pay for school.”

Speaking on behalf of A.S. 
External Affairs, West said the fee 
increase is merely a stopgap in 
response to California’s dire eco-
nomic situation. 

“[The regents] continue to 
increase their fees as the number-
one solution whenever there is a 
need for more revenue for the UC 
system,” she said.

The Blue and Gold Opportunity 
Plan — which will provide qualified 
UC undergraduates with enough 
scholarship and grant assistance to 
cover their systemwide fees for the

The $53 million Conrad Prebys 
Music Center opens to the public this 
weekend with a series of pieces that 
will showcase its state-of-the-art per-
formance space. Music department 
chairman Rand Steiger called the hall 

an architectural and acoustic “miracle.”
The 400-seat concert hall was 

designed by Mark Reddington of  LMN 
Architects in collaboration with leg-
endary acoustician Cyril Harris, whose 
resume includes the John F. Kennedy 

Center for the Arts in Washington, 
D.C., and the Metropolitan Opera 
House in New York City.

The hall’s asymmetrical, triangular 
interior immediately sets it apart from 
conventional performance spaces. In 
fact, Steiger said the end result exceed-
ed even the designers’ expectations.

“I think it’s probably the best work 
that they’ve done, and it reflects the 
spirit of and respect for innovation that 
we have in the department,” he said. 
“In most concert halls, you either have 
a very clear sound that’s dry, or a really 
reverberant sound that isn’t so clear. 
But when you get it just right, you get 
that clarity of the initial impulse and 
then you get this beautiful bloom of 
sound around it.”

UCSD principal architect Michael 
Downs, who oversaw the project, said 
the music center was a challenge to 
pull off because every wall, ceiling and 
floor had to suit a specific acoustic 
need. The exterior of the concert hall, 
for example, includes 12 to 18 inches 
of concrete to act as a shield against 
the noise of passing planes and buses.

“Basically, it’s a building within a 
building,” Downs said.

Designed specifically for chamber 
and experimental music, the hall does 
not accommodate a full symphony. 
However, piano performance gradu-
ate student William Fried — one of 
the first musicians to play inside — 
said the hall’s small, wrap-around stage 

creates an intimate and comfortable 
environment for both performers and 
audience members.

He added that recordings of live 
performances in the new space will 
sound much better than in Mandeville 
Auditorium — built in 1975 — where 

After 34 years in 
Mandeville, the music 
dept. moves to a modern
acoustic landmark.

first four years of their college edu-
cation — was approved in February.

Despite the plan’s promises, 
however, Chavez said she remains 
dissatisfied with the fine print.

“The university is not paint-
ing the bigger picture, because the 
[financial aid] money is only seen 
for the upcoming year,” Chavez 
said. “Students won’t feel problems 
because of the Blue and Gold plan 
next year, but the money is only 
short term and not guaranteed.”

Chen, who also serves as a mem-
ber of UCSA, said the regents have 
failed to take into consideration 
what impact the fees will have on 
students.

“It’s easy for us to be known as a 
budget item during these meetings, 
but by putting personal stories to 
the fee increases, we show that we’re 
not a statistic,” she said.

tion that would have ceased the cafe’s 
operations beginning June 30. 

Grove student manager Thomas 
Frank, who attended last night’s meet-
ing to offer his input, said he looks for-
ward to working closely with the new 
council — which will enter office next 
week — on maintaining a profitable 
business model for the cafe.

“One advantage to this long, drawn-
out process is that now I know people 
on A.S.,” Frank said. “Now I know how 
to contact people … now I can show 
up whenever I want and propose ideas 
about the Grove for them to discuss.” 

Throughout last night’s discus-
sion, councilmembers referenced the 
Grove’s performance over the last year 
as an indicator of its future sustainabil-
ity. The cafe’s combined losses of over 
$35,000 since July drew vocal criticism 
from many who feared that profits 
would continue to dip. 

Associate Vice President of 
Programming Garrett Berg proposed 
an amendment to the legislation call-
ing for a reworking of the Grove’s 
business model, saying the cafe would 
continue to fail if its current model is 
sustained.

“I think it’s going to take a really 

long time to come up with a solid plan 
that doesn’t mirror everything we’ve 
tried in the past,” Berg said.

However, Frank and Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Naasir 
Lakhani pointed to the Grove’s recent 
profit of over $1,000 for the month of 
April, asserting that the cafe’s current 
business model is sustainable. Lakhani 
also said the Grove will see increased 
profits once nonstudent manager 
Cleveland Thomas leaves the cafe in 
June, eliminating the position’s $50,000 
annual salary.

“We would’ve made $12,000 this 
year without the salaried manager,” 
Lakhani said.

Incoming A.S. President Utsav 

Gupta, who opposed the legislation to 
cease Grove operations, said he will 
work with the cafe’s managers to devise 
a new business model and ensure that 
the eatery develops a customer base. 

“I have to make sure that we do 
make the Grove profitable, that we do 
make the Grove a more active place,” he 
said. “Part of that is going to be using a 
new business model, using a student-
run business model to reduce costs, but 
that’s not enough. It needs advertising 
initiatives, it needs to get out there, and 
that’s going to be an effort of both the 
A.S. Council and the Grove.”

Last night was a  long emotional rollercoaster, as it was the last meeting of the year for the 
2008-09 A.S. Council.

The council passed resolutions 
in support of implementing “a-g” 
requirements in all high schools in 
San Diego County, creating a graffiti 
landmark on campus and upholding 
corporate social responsibility.

Following the approval of the reso-
lutions, councilmembers, Grove Caffe 
student manager Thomas Frank and 
2006 Revelle College alumnus Rachel 
Corell debated for 
nearly three hours 
over whether 
or not to cease 
operation of the 
struggling eatery. 
The council voted 
to keep the cafe 
open.

South Asian student organization 
Sangam put in a last-minute funding 
request for their culture show, which 
is set to take place this Saturday at the 
Copley Symphony Hall in downtown 
San Diego. The item was allowed into 
the new business section, and Sangam 
was heavily criticized for asking for 
additional funding for the tradition 
event for yet another year.

“I would have been fine with this 
three weeks ago. I just think that this 
is really irresponsible,” Associate Vice 
President of Academic Affairs Lana 
Blank said. “They asked for $3,000, 
we decided to give them $5,000, I 
don’t even know how finance came to 
that conclusion.”

Associate Vice President of 
Programming Garrett Berg sheep-
ishly admitted that he had motioned 
to fund $5,000 based off of the orga-
nization’s request for $10,000, not 
realizing that $3,000 was the actual 
requested amount. 

Revelle College Senator Katie Hall 

successfully motioned to amend the 
amount awarded to be $3,000, and the 
council approved the funding request 
despite the immense level of dissatis-
faction with the organization.

All-Campus Senator Chris 
Westling’s proposal to have the council 
scrutinize the updated campus speech 
policy was not allowed into new busi-
ness, and will subsequently be one 
of the many happy tasks for the new 
council to square away in the follow-
ing weeks.

Many councilmembers waxed 
sentimental over 
the experiences 
of working with 
one another dur-
ing open forum, 
including Sixth 
College Senator 
John Cressey, 

who said with feeling, “I’ll carry A.S. 
in my heart forever.”

Berg informed the council about 
the A.S. Sun God store, which occu-
pies the former STA Travel space 
next to the box office. He begged 
councilmembers to help out at the 
Sun God festival, promising volun-
teers one-of-a-kind staff T-shirts and 
unlimited in-and-out privileges in 
the festival area.

Blank congratulated the council 
for passing the most resolutions and 
featuring the most intense public 
inputs she has ever witnessed. She 
ended her mini-speech by leading a 
vigorous applause around the forum 
for President Donna Bean.

Bean gave a few words of wisdom 
to incoming President-elect Utsav 
Gupta before giving a few thanks of 
her own.

“We got really lucky with the peo-
ple we’ve worked with,” Bean said. 
“I’m just extremely proud of everyone 
for being extremely invested. I hope I 
see you again, just not here.”

mechanical noise and poor acoustics 
have left him frustrated.

“If you have to send out a live 
recording of your playing, you want it 
to be the best quality possible,” he said.

Located at the corner of Gilman 
Drive and Russell Lane in Sixth College, 
the three-story, 46,880-square-foot 
building also houses six digital record-
ing studios, a recording booth with 
live-streaming capabilities, computer 
labs and rehearsal rooms, one large 
enough to accommodate the La Jolla 
Symphony and Chorus.

Many of these spaces are extremely 
versatile, Steiger said. After receiving 

a flood of faculty input, his planning 
committee brainstormed ways to con-
solidate room functions in order to 
stay below the square-footage cap. 

The most obvious example is the 
second floor’s 150-seat Experimental 
Theater, which is loaded with $150,000 
in microphones and speakers, creat-
ing a virtual acoustic system that can 
be adjusted with the push of a but-
ton. This technology allows the room 
to serve as a lecture hall, as well as 
a performance space for a range of 
ensembles and soloists. 

In addition, faculty members spe-
cializing in computer music will use the 
space as an ongoing research project, 

exploring the capabilities of the system 
and collaborating with its creators at 
Berkeley’s Meyer Sound to improve it.

Steiger said that building a world 
landmark for musical exploration 
comes with an obligation to share it.

“A lot of people are going to want to 
put more of their creative energy here 
because it’s such a privileged place to 
work in,” he said. “From the point of 
view of our relationship to the city, the 
campus and the larger musical commu-
nity, it’s a really important moment for 
us. It’s up to us now not to fumble that.”

the UC Students Association.
Last year, Bernal — in collabora-

tion with student regent Ben Allen, 
then regent-designate D’Artagnan 
Scorza and the UCSA executive board 
— was active in lowering a proposed 
fee increase from 10 percent at $663 
per student to 7 percent at $464 per 
student. This lower fee increase, Bernal 
said, reflects the best the UC system 
could do during the financial crisis.

“I think that the unfortunate thing 
I realized [working on the fees] ... is 
that our colleagues on the board are 
saying that these are as close to zero as 
we would like to see them,” Bernal said.

Bernal said he recognizes the 
impact the national economic crisis 
has had on students from lower- and 
middle-class incomes, but that he sees 
hope in programs such as the Blue and 
Gold Opportunity Plan that provide 
assistance for students whose family 
income level falls below $60,000.

“I think the sticker price and the 
sticker shock issue is very relevant,” 
Bernal said. “The other side of the coin 
is that the university does pretty well to 

support these lower-income students.”
Bernal said one of the reasons he 

was interested in becoming a student 
regent is that LGBT issues have been 
absent from all nine of the university’s 
annual reports on staff diversity[??].

“I’ve been fortunate enough to 
be able to already start working with 
some of the UC LGBT center direc-
tors on gaining a better understand-
ing of the campus climate in terms of 
LGBT diversity,” Bernal said. “I think 
it’s important for the [regents] to gain 
some insight into [the issues concern-
ing] our LGBT community and LGBT 
communities of color on campuses.”

Bernal lobbied with graduate stu-
dents from Students Advocating for 
Graduate Education in Washington 
last week for loan forgiveness for grad-
uates entering careers in public service. 

Alongside  former UCSA President 
Louise Hendrickson, Bernal said he 
also worked to increase the financial-
aid calendar from nine to 12 months 
for graduate students, ensuring cover-
age during the summer.

Stovitz and Nunn Gorman are tak-
ing their roles as ex-officio regents 

by following the paths described by 
the AAUC bylaws, under which the 
secretary and treasurer of the Alumni 
Association take over as the presi-
dent and vice president of the AAUC. 
Neither Stovitz nor Nunn Gorman 
could be reached for comment.

Stovitz is a UC Riverside gradu-
ate and the retired presiding judge 
of the State Bar Court of California, 
which investigates cases of attorney 
misconduct. He served as president of 
the UCR Alumni Association last year 
and is currently a trustee of the UCR 
foundation.

UCLA graduate Nunn Gorman 
served as president of Brilliance 
Strategies Inc. — a management con-
sulting firm that specializes in non-
profit organizational development — 
and is a part of multiple nonprofits. 
She acts as the chair of the board of 
directors of the California Association 
of Nonprofits, co-chair of the Chaka 
Khan Foundation and the last presi-
dent of the UCLA Alumni Association.

In a perfect, environmentally conscious world, we’d all carry reusable dishware and bottles. In 
reality, we use products that come in 
disposable containers or require paper 
packaging. Producing waste seems like 
it’s out of our immediate control, but 
it’s not. We’ve heard about the three 
Rs — reduce, reuse, recycle — so much 
that they trigger eye-rolls quicker than 
you can say “landfill,” but the slogan 
prioritizes environmental action.

By reducing, we should evaluate our 
consumption and eliminate unneces-
sary products and practices. If we don’t 
buy products in disposable packaging, 
companies won’t produce them. By 
reusing, we can maximize our available 
materials’ use. This means investing 
in a sturdy water bottle rather than 
buying a new bottle each day. And 
finally — as a last resort — we should 
recycle unnecessary resources when 
they become absolutely useless. 

Our third and most hyped R is the 
most controversial: Many argue recy-
cling actually wastes more energy than 
throwing trash into a landfill.

True, recycling isn’t a flawless pro-
cess. Recycling facilities rely on local 
power grids, which depend on coal-
fired plants. On the other side of the 
coin, virgin paper mills typically use 
less fossil fuel to operate than waste-
paper facilities. This is because the 
machines used to make new paper 
are usually powered by timber detri-
tus — a waste product from the wood 
pulping process. In terms of carbon-
dioxide emissions, coal is generally 
dirtier than wood. The Environmental 
Defense Fund argues that recycling 
paper cuts overall greenhouse gas 
emissions by decreasing the amount 
of waste diverted to landfills (where 
decomposition leads to the production 
of methane, a more potent greenhouse 
gas) and by not cultivating new forest 
lands, though research is still sketchy 
in this area.

Critics argue that the fossil fuels 
used to run collection trucks offset the 
environmental merits of recycling. But 
according to a study by Washington-
based environmental consultant Jeffrey 
Morris, 10.4 million British thermal 
units are used to manufacture prod-
ucts from a ton of recyclables. A total 
of 0.9 Btu are used to collect, haul and 
process recyclables (much less than the 
23.3 million Btu required for making 
virgin materials). So even from an 
energy standpoint, it makes perfect 
sense to recycle. 

Through recycling, we can save 
energy because we have the technol-
ogy to make the same products at 
a fraction of the cost of mining and 
extracting natural resources to make 
new products.

If you want to break it down to 
specific materials, Morris found that 
aluminum requires 96 percent less 
energy if made from recycled cans 
than bauxite (the mineral ore from 
which virgin, or new, aluminum is 
harvested). Recycled plastic bottles use 
76 percent less energy; newsprint uses 
about 45 percent less. Recycled glass 
comes in at the lowest, saving us about

Riddle me this.You’re a UC regent, and you’re scheduled to vote on 
whether to increase student fees 
by $662 per quarter next week. 
You’re slated to make this decision 
at a public meeting held at UCSD, 
where you expect to encounter stu-
dents who have seen fees continu-
ally rise since they were freshmen. 
Simultaneously, a mild form of the 
flu breaks out in San Diego, elicit-
ing panic throughout much of the 
community. 

What do you do?
If you were anything like the real 

regents, you’d release a statement 
in which you discreetly cancel your 
visit and use swine flu as a cop-out. 

In complete disregard for the 
students who have been looking 
forward to their visit for months, 
the university’s higher-ups did just 
that last Friday afternoon. 

Today, instead of facing a long 
line of cash-strapped students 
demanding a more affordable edu-
cation, the UC Board of Regents 
will be voting on a potential $1,986 
student-fee increase for the 2009-10 
academic year — over the phone.

It’s doubtful the regents canceled 
their campus visit because they 
were genuinely worried they would 
“divert the attention or resourc-
es” our campus needs to combat 
the hardly lethal swine flu. There 
have been no recorded cases of the 
disease at UCSD, which  — reas-
sured by Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox’s incessant e-mails — means we 
don’t really have anything to worry 
about. Even if, say, 2,000 Tritons 
contracted the disease overnight, 

those responsible for orchestrating 
the meeting wouldn’t be tasked with 
tending to runny-nosed students. 

The UC regents were well aware 
they were going vote to raise student 
fees today, like they do almost every 
year, and used the pandemic as a 
scapepig.

Because more important than a 
disease-free meeting is one without 
mobs of angry students and negative 
media attention. By voting via tele-
conference, the regents are ducking 
unpleasant obstacles in the way of 
raising student fees during a diffi-
cult recession.

Perhaps even more cowardly, the 
board scheduled the conference one 
week after the deadline for admits to 
submit their intent to register. 

It’s nothing more than a vicious 

corporate tactic, considering an extra 
$1,986 in student fees is enough for 
any middle-class family to choose 
community college or a less expen-
sive California State University cam-
pus over a UC campus. 

The board, in essence, got exactly 
what it wanted: Incoming students 
chose their preferred campus without 
all the financial facts, and a stu-
dent-organized rally against this fee 
increase meeting — scheduled to take 
place at UCSD — was canceled. 

It’s common courtesy to let  
prospective students know exactly 
how much they’re expected to pay 
for their education, and existing 
students should be offered more 
than a 20-minute over-the-phone 
courtesy Q-and-A when a 10 per-
cent fee increase is at stake. Until 

the regents start showing us some 
respect, we can only expect these 
strategic moves to become semi-
permanent side acts to their annual 
fee-hike routine.

The regents have proven to 
be masterminds at finding ways 
to avoid the public hot seat and 
ignore students; it’s about time they 
channel that energy into creating 
a more sustainable financial plan 
for the UC system. Maybe a genu-
ine conversation between students 
and regents might result in a little 
less fee increasing and a little more 
progress.

But if they refuse to give us 
anything more than 20 minutes of 
phone time, they should at least 
have the decency to tell us they don’t 
care in person.

In its final meeting, and after months of consideration, the 2008-09 A.S. Council voted not 
to cease operations of the ailing 
Grove Caffe. The decision, which 
some councilmembers are liberally 
calling the enterprise’s last chance, 
marks a renewed attention to enter-
prises that incoming President 
Utsav Gupta and incoming Vice 
President of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch hope to foster next 
year.

Now the new council finds itself 
trudging into office with the cafe’s 
future largely unresolved. But unlike 
transitions past, councilmembers 
must make sure that Grove oversight 
doesn’t get lost in the shuffle. This 
means prioritizing the enterprise 
office, and council-cafe relations.

The current Grove Advisory 
Committee is a joke at best, with the 
deeply indebted cafe as its punch-
line. Forming a serious group of 
councilmembers, Grove employees 
and financial advisors is a crucial 
first step that must be handled 
immediately. 

Benesch and Gupta should 
approach the appointment of asso-
ciate vice president of enterprise 
operations with a higher standard 
for the position, and demand a pro-
activity and accountability that was 
absent from Chelsea Maxwell’s two-
year tenure. 

Once appointments are final-
ized in two weeks, these committee 
meetings must start immediately. 
It almost goes without saying, but 
obviously the meetings should be 
mandatory, weekly and provide 
detailed progress reports to the A.S. 
Council every Wednesday. And not 
just during the transition period — 
this committee and the enterprise 

office play a vital role in any future 
Grove success. 

Every councilmember should be 
personally invested in the Grove’s 
success, rather than passing the buck 
as we’ve seen council after council 
do. This means taking initiative to 
stay on top of the cafe’s business 
decisions and finances — without 
depending on vague, slanted infor-
mation or anecdotal interactions. 
To pull their enterprise out of debt 
councilmembers must get down to 
the nitty-gritty. 

Some of the Grove’s most out-
spoken council supporters were also 
involved with the 2007 decision, but 
they find their favored coffee shop 
in even more dire straits just two 
years later because they failed to 
address any of its problems.

Councilmembers should be 
involved in every aspect of the 
Grove’s operations. While revamp-

ing the business plan to make it 
profitable is an imperative first step, 
the council must also support the 
enterprise’s advertising and pro-
gramming efforts (because hiring 
the Deejay and Vinylphiles Club to 
drown out KSDT radio for a few 
hours creates a racket more likely 
to make students flee the area than 
visit it).

Last night’s discussion was noth-
ing new: Grove employees provided 
no new insight, councilmembers 
added no new ideas to this years-
long debate and the nearly three-
hour conversation yielded no new 
(or solid) plans. Even this board’s 
recommendations contain nothing 
new; for years the Guardian has 
rallied and pleaded for increased 
council oversight.

But the incoming council — with 
a horde of members committed spe-
cifically to cleaning up the finance 

and enterprise offices, led by Grove 
enthusiasts Gupta and Benesch — is 
new. And this new group should 
prepare its momentum for a massive 
overhaul.

21 percent of manufacturing energy. 
Plastics are made from crude oil, 

glass from sand and silica, aluminum 
from bauxite and paper from trees. By 
recycling, we reduce the need to use 
oil, cut down trees and mine for met-
als. By trashing everything, we spend 
more money and energy to mine and 
extract new resources, while recycla-
bles just hang out in landfills for the 
next several hundred years waiting to 
decompose instead of being reincar-
nated into your next shirt (yes, some 
bottles are recycled into polyester).

Miramar Landfill on Convoy Street 
estimates that about 1.4 million tons of 
San Diego’s trash goes to its site every 

year. Because of recycling and other 
diversion techniques, the amount has 
decreased by 400,000 tons from an 
average of 1.8 million tons in 1988. 
According to the Disposal Division 
of the Environmental Services 
Department, current estimates antici-
pate that the Miramar Landfill will 
reach capacity sometime around 2012. 
Who knows where we’ll put our trash 
then. But because over 60 percent of 
our trash is recyclable, according to 
the Environmental Protection Agency, 
we have the power to postpone that 
disaster.

Recycling is a good alternative for 
maximizing our resources and pre-
venting waste, but it’s not the magical 

solution. We can’t just nonchalantly 
use tons of bottles, cans and paper, 
thinking that recycling is magically 
going to solve environmental issues. 

Everything is part of a balance, 
and our actions directly tip the scales. 
If we’re going to continue bottling 
beverages and packaging products, 
recycling is as close to a win-win solu-
tion we can have for those materials. 
Throwing recyclables away is what 
it is: a waste. I know I can’t reach 
into every single trash can and take 
out the recyclables. If you do recycle, 
keep up the effort — your actions will 
affect future generations’ mindsets. 
Influence others through your actions 
and awareness will spread.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

Dear Editor,
In the April 20 article, “This 

Time It’s Serious. No, Really.” about 
the Grove Caffe, Hadley Mendoza 
wrote: “Students can only hope 
that this year’s council really has 
the institutional memory it brags 
about.” 

Let’s be honest, neither the A.S. 
Council nor the Guardian has insti-
tutional memory. Neither source has 
past minutes or articles easily avail-
able and searchable online, and both 
organizations’ members are always 
changing yearly or even monthly, so 
memory relies on those who choose 
to save information themselves or 
keep their synapses intact.

Let’s look at institutional memo-
ry — back to the Grove’s glory days 
when lines were long and food was 
great. Before the A.S. commissioner 
of services and enterprises — it 
used to be one combined office — 
couldn’t figure out if it was “Caffe” 
or “Cafe.” 

The Grove used to be owned and 
operated with love by Ron Carlson, 
until the council decided to try to 
fully own an enterprise it couldn’t 
and didn’t want to handle. 

The A.S. Council has a history of 
horrible business management and 
financial decisions — often dipping 
into its mandate reserves fund to 
bail itself out of another debacle. 

Even the administration doesn’t 
trust the A.S. Council to own any-
thing, as evidenced by our complete 
lack of control and ownership over 
the Price Center and Student Center 
expansions and the SRTV shutdown 
of 2005.

Councilmembers can whine 
about what happened to the Grove, 
but it is their own fault. They chose 
to buy it out from the previous 
owner; they chose to not promote 

it. The Grove isn’t even listed on the 
A.S. Web site as an enterprise. They 
chose to hire inept people to run it, 
and now they are choosing to let 
it die. How many councilmembers 
have ever even eaten there? 

Go back to when the Grove had 
delicious and fresh brie sandwiches 
instead of prepackaged junk. Back 
to when the coffee was great and 
people hung out to play bongos, 
study and chat. Even back to the 
recent fight to get meal points there 
in 2005, which was almost imme-
diately forgotten. Even the current 
“Save the Grove Caffe” fight rests 
on bad coffee and spelling mis-
takes.

I’m all in favor of saving the 
Grove and not letting it die into a 
new office space, but it will require 
the tremendous effort of people who 
both care and have good business 
sense. I don’t think the current A.S. 
Council has either. Its best bet is 
to give the Grove to someone who 
does, like its thrown-away idea of 
the Rady School or a business-savvy 
alum. 

My institutional memory hopes 
the Grove stays alive.

C
ue the LEDs. Digitalism is this year’s hot new thing: 
A tsunami of top-40 hits are cleverly distorting their 
vocals (“Blame It On the Alcohol,” “Boom Boom 
Pow”) and techno-flavored indie bands are climbing 

the charts. Now, Sixth College’s Kuncocshun Festival is stepping 
in line, skipping over a tradition of mellow rock acts to hire its 
Grammy-nominated headliner — and after that A.S. mandate-
reserve funding fiasco, Shiny Toy Guns better be damn good.

On the outside, the Los Angeles band is weird enough. 
Goth “Matrix” attire (S&M straps and plenty of guyliner to go 
around), Chad Petree’s emo swoon and Sisley Treasure’s grrly 
thrash are paraded atop Jeremy Dawson’s insane carnival keys. 
(Guessing we’re not in Kansas anymore, people.) 

Both the Guns’ singles interchange pure party synths 
(“Ricochet!”) with makeout-ready melodies (“Le Disko”). On 
stage, Treasure screams and scrapes with all the breath in her 
smoked-out lungs; Petree whispers slow and soft, tearing into 
jagged heartbreak even as he attempts a traditional rock ballad.

Judging from all 
this — and from the 
superglam “Le Disko” 
video that transforms a 
stripper into a tarantula — it’s 
hard to know what to expect. 
After a lifetime of Britneys and 
Dashboards headlining the festivi-
ties, it’s a little strange to hear an 
up-and-coming band so openly goth 
and so willing to sell out (watch for the 
2010 Lincoln MKZ). Just hope that Shiny 
Toy Guns shock the stage with (at least) their 
glittery master-slave outfits — and that the act 
lives up to the pose.

V ersatility’s a good thing for pocket knives, thespians, power tools and music — but only if you can find a use for all the parts. Otherwise, you end up 
with gumbo: six musicians jumping from funk to 
moralizing rap, transitioning from English into 
Spanish with too many instruments competing 
for the stage to make anything tangible (not to 
mention danceable). 

Although these California kids’ flows are 
sturdy, they’re not quite substantial enough 
to carry the latitude of an ensemble playing 
(count ’em) four different instruments apiece. 
And with a low-key Kenny G vibe (for the most 
part), we’re too busy napping to notice that the 
Elevaters are blessed with a tolerable dose of 
talent. Maybe it’s supposed to sound like eleva-
tor music on E?

he downside to growing

when your songs sound like

Seeing as every track on Melee’s

towers to a mandatory crescendo, it 
doesn’t look like the Orange County

anytime soon. But if anyone’s forgotten 
what the first CD their mom ever bought

L ooks as if Incomplete Neighbor has connections in student government — after opening Rock ‘n’ Roosevelt back in February, they’re vets to the college-fest circuit. Still burned into my memory 
from the first catastrophe: A few plaid-PJed froshies scurry 

by with one hand balancing a Ventanas tray and all other fin-
gers stuffed in their ear holes. Keyboardist waterfalls his Pro-V 

ringlets with so much passion that all the bats nesting there 
squawk into the night, biologically unable to tolerate vibrations 

like “You’ve got your lights on/ But you don’t see me” escaping 
from toothless yawn of lead singer. (Complete with supplementary 

ooh-oohs “You don’t” and “See me” from two off-key Harrisons on 
guitars.) In the “crowd,” three short pre-meds with matching pea 

coats headbang their (also matching) haircuts shyly. “Hey, that’s my 
MMW T.A.,” one dude says, standing awkwardly in his Revelle orienta-

tion T-shirt and Elvis Costello glasses. MMW shout-out match ensues. 
Lead singer plays a number called “Pillanoid,” then announces there’s 

still time for three more songs.

 So, yeah — you wouldn’t want to miss the sequel.— Simone WilsonSenior Staff Writer

Heaven and Hell
■ The Devil You Know
RHINO

H ide the women and children — Black Sabbath’s back.They might call themselves Heaven and Hell now, but don’t be fooled by the moniker change: This is 
Ronny James Dio-era Sabbath. The Devil You Know is 
a thunderous comeback, descending (as only Sabbath 
could) into menacing riffs and consuming visions of 
hellfire.

Guitars set a sinister pulse for Vinny Appice’s raw, 
spine-tingling drums to herald “Atom and Evil.” These are 
your final rites, and Dio’s condemning tenor bids absolute 
surrender: “Expand your mind, we’ve got a place for you/ 
Just make believe that one and one are always two.” 

Just when “The Bible Black” enthralls with an inno-
cent, wistful intro worthy of “Stairway to Heaven,” the 
facade is torn away, revealing the red-hot obsession boil-
ing beneath. Dio’s clarion snarl (think angry Gregorian 
monk) frames the album’s fall from grace, drawing an epic 

centerpiece of crosses and bones. 
From there, Heaven and Hell basks in its own shadow. 

“Eating the Cannibals” is a Harley of a track, its engine 
ripping with a flurry of bass pedal to an 80-mph, traffic-
swerving solo from (probable AARP qualifier) Tommy 
Iommi.

Though a few tracks aren’t as sinister with the volume 
cranked low, it’s the album’s only major sin. Between 
“Cannibals” and “The Bible Black,” Devil bloodies our 
gums, with fresh material for new and old fans alike. 
It’s their masochistic power to peel back the skin that 
counts, fueling what will surely be one of this year’s big-
gest metal releases. So do yourself a favor and drown 
yourself in the distortion.

recordingsABRAMS SCORES LONG-AWAITED 
VICTORY FOR NEXT-GEN TREKKIES

By David Harvey
Senior Staff Writer

J .J. Abrams has come a long way from the dreadful finale of “Alias.” (Nevermind that the show was well 
received among both closeted and not-
so-closeted sci-fi fanatics.) Since land-
ing the limelight with “Lost,” Abrams 
— today’s George Lucas  — revives an 
artifact worthy of 
an Indiana Jones 
crusade. That’s 
right — “Star 
Trek” delivers. 

Fans of the 
original series 
were apprehen-
sive, to say the 
least; so many critics were touting the 
failures of odd-numbered “Trek” films 
that the latest remake seemed cursed 
from the beginning. 

Surprisingly, though, one of the 
film’s only pitfalls is its pandering 
to tradition. Name-dropping feels 
forced, catchphrases like “Damn it 
Spock, I’m a doctor, not a physi-
cist!” were thrown in like obligatory 
afterthoughts and the token random 
red-shirt guy was doomed to die the 
moment he left the ship. 

But, with a time-travel-induced 
alternate universe caused by space vil-
lain Nero — played by Eric Bana, with 
the same subtlety he brought to the 

Australian hit “Chopper” — Abrams 
takes his “Trek” where no “Trek” has 
gone before. A hefty feat, considering 
the countless television spinoffs and 10 
filmic remakes. 

Center stage in the prequel are the 
young James T. Kirk (Chris Pine, as 
convincing as in his neo-Nazi assassin 
role in “Smoking Aces”) and Spock 
(Zachary Quinto, with all the pas-

sion that keeps 
“Heroes” heart-
throttling). 

But unlike 
in “Wolverine,” 
the other early 
summer block-
buster, the sup-
porting crew of  

characters — Dr. McCoy, Uhura and 
even helmsman Chekov — are quite 
well developed. The film also doesn’t 
get soaked in the lousy love-story 
drama of “Trek” head writer Roberto 
Orci, who brought us both the stale 
“Mission: Impossible III” and sloppy 
“Transformers.” Don’t get too excited, 
though — Orci’s romantic ineptitude 
creeps into the periphery.

The charm of this “Trek” prequel 
can be its breaks from the original 
(please forgive me, devout Trekkies), 
which kick-start an aged genre. It 
might not be a tried-and-true remake 
of a classic, but it’s damn good sum-
mer fare.

Ben Folds
■ Ben Folds Presents: University A Capella!
EPIC

L ike Ben Folds as much as he likes himself?If so, go snatch University A Capella!, the forty-some-thing’s sweetest pop pitch yet. And it’s made by kids just 
like you: The former Billboarder enlisted a hodgepodge of 
collegiate a capella groups to revamp his resume. 

What a surprise, then, that the lowly amateurs one-up 
the pro. This is a movie we’ve all seen before — students 
surpass teacher’s expectations, and how! 

Folds’ thinly veiled scramble for street cred is a sadder 
story every repeat. Too bad: As one-third of the super-cute 
Ben club (along with Kweller and Lee), he could have had 
it in the bag.

Covers are hard for anyone to pull off, much less covers 
by a bunch of star-struck talents looking for their big break. 
Folds scrutinized hundreds of entries trying to capture 
America’s youthful “magic” and release it to the public for 
a nominal fee. Spotlighting the nation’s newest vocal talents 
might be the best part of this equation, though, because 

most of the lead singers can belt Folds’ songs better than he 
can — even with Peter Pan-isms like “Everybody knows it 
sucks to grow up.” Biggest props to the University of Georgia, 
whose choir covers “You Don’t Know Me” with all of Regina 
Spektor’s ornamental whimsy. 

“Boxing” yanks a lone soprano out of obscurity and 
sets her a-wailing over Folds’ boy-next-door croon; her 
Broadway trills ice his clunky vocals with stale-enough frost-
ing. He responds like a man: “Sometimes I punch myself 
hard as I can.” (Go on, do it.)

Just wondering — where exactly are the UCSD Tritones? 
Step it up! Maybe you’ll make Ben Folds’ newest Greatest Hits 
album if you can harmonize “Effington” with the best of ’em.

Ben Folds will perform live in San Diego at the House of 
Blues on May 21 — sans a capella amateurs.

PASTEL YOGA DOC WAXES ‘REAL WORLD: INDIA’

By Michael Tang
Staff Writer

E ighteen million Americans prac-tice a Baskin-Robbins variety of yoga,” director Kate Churchill 
said [in an interview]. “It’s better than 
sex.” 

To prove her point, the seven-
year practitioner enlists urbane New 
Yorker Nick Rosen — offspring of 
a lawyer and a shamanic healer — 
to undergo a social experiment that 
includes trotting the globe in search 
of yoga’s true meaning. 

Of course, the multibillion-dollar 
industry is also one that prides itself 
on doing exactly as what film’s title 
flagrantly suggests: achieving enlight-
enment.

The mission takes Churchill and 
Rosen from isolated forest in Hawaii 
to the cow-infested roadside offices 

of master yogis in India. But per-
haps their most poignant visit is with 
ex-pro-wrestler-turned-master-yogi 
Diamond Dallas Page, who captures 
America’s insatiable thirst for cultural 
fusion gone wrong. 

“Yoga is about T and A,” roars Page 
as he performs a couple asanas on his 
prim lawn in West Hollywood, two 
scantily clad blondes contorting their 
bodies in the background. 

Unfortunately, Churchill’s brash 
and incorrigible commitment to 
describing yoga as nothing more than 
a high-brow workout — berating a 
laid-back Rosen in multiple interviews 
for not treating yoga as a tool of “trans-
formation” — overwhelms what little 
objectivity the film rides on. 

As a result, “Up!” becomes less 
about yoga as an art form and more 
about the rather dysfunctional and 
hilarious relationship between 

Churchill and her subject. Eventually, 
Churchill’s curiosity sinks to disen-
chantment, leaving Rosen with the 
troublesome burden of re-energizing 
an otherwise banal and cursory study 
of a two-millennia-old spiritual prac-
tice.

“Up!” does do a good job of 
detouring from the Ken Burns factoid-
based documentary — albeit largely 
by substituting fact with         drama. And 
creviced between clips of Rosen’s emo-
tional breakdowns and Churchill’s 
frustration are pockets of wisdom 
in interviews with world-renowned 
gurus. 

The bubble-gum soundtrack and 
pastel palette of the film might accen-
tuate Churchill’s spunk more than 
advance the storyline, but it’s at least 
a reminder to audiences that “Up!” is 
more a soccer-mom fix than a source 
of spiritual guidance.

Enlighten Up!
   

Starring Kate Churchill & Nick Rosen
Directed by Kate Churchill

who has endured several defeats at 
the hands of Hawaii Pacific in her 
career, helped clinch the 5-4 win for 
UCSD by also coming back from a 
set down for a stirring 4-6, 6-1, 7-5 
win at the No. 6 singles position.

“It was so rewarding to beat Hawaii 
Pacific during the regular season, 
but the stakes are raised now that 
the season has become a do-or-die 
situation,” Tran said. “Entering this 
matchup, I feel our team has a much 
higher level of belief in each other, 
which gives us an advantage over the 
last meeting against the Sea Warriors.”

On paper, this weekend’s match 
looks to be as exciting as the 
previous encounter, with the Sea 
Warriors on a roll, having won six 
of their last seven matches entering 

this showdown. Hawaii Pacific has 
beaten the Tritons three times over 
the past two years, and is looking to 
avenge its loss to UCSD from earlier 
in the season. The victory on March 
2 was the first time the Tritons had 
beaten the Sea Warriors since the 
2005-06 season. The Tritons aim 
to advance into the second round 
of the regionals for the fourth 
consecutive year, while the Sea 
Warriors hope to improve on their 
Sweet 16 appearance from last year. 

The winner of this matchup will 
move one step closer toward the 
NCAA Championships, which will 
take place in Altamonte Springs, 
Fla., from May 13 to May 16.

Readers can contact Neil Joshi at 
nejoshi@ucsd.edu.

Negishi led a unit that battled 
adversity all season. His experience 
at the top of the lineup has helped a 
relatively young unit to an 8-3 record 
in its last 11 matches.

Hawaii Pacific owns a head-
to-head win over UCSD, a 7-2 
triumph on March 1 that dropped 
the Tritons to 4-6 overall. In that 
match, freshman Jake Fellow was 
the only player to record a win in 
singles, earning a victory at the No. 
3 spot. In doubles, Negishi teamed 
up with sophomore Erik Elliot to 
record UCSD’s only other point at 
No. 1 doubles. Hawaii Pacific has 
dominated its last seven matches 
with a 6-1 record, earning the 
region’s top seed.

As the team’s captain, Negishi 

knows UCSD can compete with the 
Sea Warriors despite the lopsided 
score that it lost by earlier in the 
season. However, he knows each 
individual will need to be better than 
they were on the first of March and 
play at the top of his game.

“Our doubles needs to step it up 
and play a really clean match,” he 
said. “If they are able to establish that, 
we can have a sense of belief in our 
squad. We barely lost to them earlier 
in the year while missing two of our 
of starters, so as a team we know we 
can compete with them.” 

Thursday’s game against the Sea 
Warriors is slated to begin at 2:30 
p.m.

teams off balance and had runners on 
base a lot of the time, but she held her 
composure in adverse conditions, and 
that is hard for a freshman.”

UCSD followed the victory over 
Humboldt State with a battle against 
Sonoma State, winning 3-2. The 
Tritons scored in the top of the first 
on an RBI double from junior catcher 
Nicole Saari. The Seawolves went on 
to even the score at one in their half 
of the first. UCSD then took the lead, 
making the game a 3-1 contest in the 
top of third, when May belted a two-
run homer to left field. The Seawolves 
reduced the Triton lead to one run in 
the bottom of the fourth, but UCSD 
shut out Sonoma State for the rest of 
the game, with Gaito picking up her 
11th win of the season.

“The team is playing very well right 
now and our bats are hot,” Gerckens 

said.
With the two victories, UCSD 

advanced to the CCAA Tournament 
Championship title game and was 
set to play for the title in a rematch 
against rival Cal State Monterey Bay. 
However, the Tritons were unable 
to compete for the conference title 
as severe weather caused the game 
to be canceled. Shortened by rain, 
the tournament reverted to a single-
elimination format and Cal State 
Monterey Bay was declared the 2009 
CCAA Champions.

“Monterey got lucky last weekend 
with the rainout of the championship 
game.” Lesovsky said. “We will take it 
to them this weekend at regionals.”

UCSD will face Hawaii Pacific in 
the first round of the NCAA Division-
II West Regional. The regional is a four-
team double elimination tournament. 
Hawaii Pacific enters the upcoming 

match against UCSD as the winner 
of nine straight games, including a 
victory over University of Hawaii-Hilo 
in the PacWest conference title game. 
The Sea Warriors were the victors in 
a 12-3 drubbing at the Tournament 
of Champions in Turlock, Calif. The 
winner of the UCSD-HPU game will 
take on the winner of No. 3 Dixie State 
and No. 6 Cal State Monterey Bay on 
Saturday, May 9.

“The team is ready and looking 
forward to playing Hawaii Pacific,” 
Gerckens said. “If we just focus on our 
game, we will do well.”

In the other West subregional, No. 
4 Cal State Stanislaus will take on No. 
5 Montana State-Billings, and No. 1 
Humboldt State will face No. 8 Sonoma 
State on Friday in Arcata, Calif.

WEEKEND PLAYOFF PREVIEW

By John Beck
Staff Writer

SOFTBALL —  Thanks to an outstanding 
performance in their conference tourna-
ment, the Tritons have been granted the 
No. 7 seed in the NCAA Division-II West 
Regional. UCSD (29-23) will now battle 
No. 2 seed Hawaii Pacific University (35-
9) on May 8 in St. George, Utah.

The Tritons earned a third consecutive 
NCAA appearance after winning two out 
of three games in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championship 
Tournament April 30 and May 1 in 
Stockton, Calif. 

Third seeded UCSD started the 
CCAA tournament on a sour note, falling 
to No. 2 seed Cal State Monterey Bay 7-3. 
In the double-elimination tournament, 
UCSD stayed alive by trouncing No. 
1 Humboldt State University 8-0 and 
taking a close contest against No. 4 
Sonoma State University 3-2.

Cal State Monterey Bay got off to a 
quick 2-0 lead against UCSD to open 
the game. With the Tritons trailing 3-1 
through four innings, an RBI single 
from senior first baseman Jenni Habib 
brought home sophomore outfielder 
Kristyn Lesovsky and tied the game. Cal 
State Monterey Bay kept UCSD’s offense 
at bay for the remainder of the game, 
shutting out the Tritons while the Otters 
scored four runs in the fifth for the 7-3 
victory.

Facing elimination against defending 
national champion Humboldt State, the 
Tritons stepped up their game, crushing 
the Warriors with 13 hits. Junior 
shortstop Amanda Eliades had two 
hits and drove in three runs in the win. 
Sophomore infielder Sarah Woofter and 
senior outfielder Allison May contributed 
two hits apiece in the victory. The Tritons’ 
domination led the game to be called after 
six innings of play via the mercy rule.

“Everyone came up clutch for us: 
hits, plays in the field, everything,” Habib 
said. “I don’t think there was anything we 
failed to do as a whole.”

Freshman pitcher Camille Gaito had 
another impressive performance. Gaito 
improved her record to 10-3, while giving 
up only three hits and striking out two 
Warriors.

“Camille was just brilliant today,” head 
coach Patti Gerckens said. “She kept both

CREW — It was a day of firsts 
for the Tritons when they learned 
their varsity eight squad would be 
making a trip to the International 
Rowing Association National 
Championships, scheduled in June. 
Racing at the Western Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association Championships 
on May 2 and 3 in Sacramento, the 
Tritons garnered a multitude of solid 
finishes to continue their record-
breaking season, ultimately placing 
third at the event.

The men’s varsity eight, second 
varsity eight, novice eight and novice 
lightweight four boats each competed 

in the Grand Finals during day two of 
the regatta on Sunday. In Saturday’s 
preliminary stages, the varsity eight 
boat foreshadowed its success, plac-
ing first in the second heat with a 
time of 6:02.3. Moving on to compete 
in the Grand Finals, the Tritons faced 
an intense showdown against their 
rival Gonzaga University.

“Gonzaga is a great crew with a lot 
of talent and depth,” senior co-captain 
Jon Lynch said before the race. “They 
know we are targeting them and we 
know they are targeting us. From the 
second the starter says, ‘row’ it is going 
to be a fight till the last stroke.”

Lynch’s prediction turned out to 
be true as both boats were neck-and-
neck around the 700-meter mark. 

The Bulldogs pushed forward to an 
advantage before the Tritons battled 
back and moved several seats into 
the lead with 500 meters left in the 
race. Unfortunately, Gonzaga was 
able to stretch ahead and slightly out 
of reach in the nick of time, crossing 
the finish line at 5:59.7. The Tritons 
finished with a time 6:00.3 to win a 
silver medal. 

The varsity eight lineup featured 
junior Andrew Hilton, senior co-
captain Ryan Andre, junior Jay Dee 
Morgan, senior Jeff Collett, sopho-
more Kris Grey, freshman Nathan 
Morgan, junior Karam Badran, soph-
omore Justin Gordon and coxswain 
Cameran Bittucci

The second varsity eight also fared 

well, winning heat two in its division 
on the first day of competition. In the 
Grand Finals, Gonzaga again placed 
first, but UCSD’s finish of 6:26.9 was 
well ahead of third-place UC Davis’ 
time of 6:31.7. The men’s novice eight 
and novice lightweight four also put 
together strong performances despite 
the horrible weather. The novice 
eight finished fourth in its Grand 
Final with a time of 6:13.6, while the 
novice lightweight four recorded a 
fifth-place finish and time of 7:11.1. 

After the day’s success, the Tritons 
took home numerous honors. Andre, 
Collett and Badran were named to 
the All-WIRA first team, while Lynch 
was a second team honoree. Head 
coach Zach Johnson was named 

Coach of the Year. 
Women’s crew also performed well 

at the event, although rowers strug-
gled with the challenge of competing 
in pounding rain. The varsity eight 
finished fourth in its petite final with 
a time of 7:29.8. Meanwhile both the 
varsity four and second varsity eight 
qualified for the Grand Finals, each 
placing sixth with times of 8:03.7 and 
7:11.5, respectively. The team finished 
the event ranked third in Division II.

Men’s crew looks to conclude 
its phenomenal season June 4 
through June 7 in its first-ever IRA 
Championships. Back into action 
a little sooner, women’s crew com-

F or the 10th straight year, the men’s tennis team earned its way into the postseason, drawing a matchup with No. 5 Hawaii Pacific University in a Division-II West 
Regional showdown this afternoon. The Tritons finished 
the season with an oscillating 12-10 mark, but is building 
momentum as it hits the home stretch. Last year, the Tritons 
earned a berth in the second round and in 2007 made the 
program’s first-ever Final Four before losing to Valdosta 
State University.

Over the last two weeks, UCSD has won four of its last 
five to gain entrance into the regional as the No. 4 seed. The 
Tritons’ matchup with the Sea Warriors will take place in 
Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, with the victor earning a coveted spot 
in the NCAA Championships from May 13 to May 16 in 
Altamonte Springs, Fla. 

“I feel like I’ve been through it all during my four years 
and through my stories and experiences, I feel I’ve helped 
the freshman class not make the same mistakes I made,” said 
senior Kazumi Negishi, UCSD’s No. 1 singles and doubles 
player.

For the first time ever, UCSD will enter the California Collegiate Athletic Association as the No. 1 seed. Unfortunately for the Tritons, their first-round matchup 
comes against the only team they failed to defeat in a four-game 
series over the last two months. 

The Tritons (33-12, 27-9 CCAA), who are ranked No. 4 in 
Division II, will face Cal State Dominguez Hills (34-19, 23-13 
CCAA) at 3 p.m. in Palm Springs today to open the conference 
tournament. The Tritons and Toros faced off April 16 to April 
18 — UCSD took two at home before falling twice on the road. 

Since then, UCSD finished its season winning six of its 
last eight games and claiming the CCAA regular-season title. 
UCSD is coming off an emotional 3-1 victory in a four-game 
set against Cal Poly Pomona in which the team swept a Senior 
Day doubleheader. The Toros also finished strong, taking five 
of their last six games to clinch the final playoff spot.

Second-seeded Sonoma State University and third-seeded 
Cal State Los Angeles will also play tomorrow, and the winners 
of the semifinal contests will face off in the championship game 
on Friday at 3 p.m.

A fter winning the California Collegiate Athletic Association regular-season title with an unde-feated record for the sixth consecutive season, the 
UCSD women’s tennis team now turns its sights toward 
postseason play. 

The Tritons are set to host No. 15 Hawaii Pacific 
University on Saturday in a West Regional matchup. No. 
10 UCSD (15-5, 9-0 CCAA) earned the program’s 28th 
straight berth in the postseason under head coach Liz 
LaPlante. The Tritons enter their showdown with Hawaii 
University (17-5) on a three-match win streak with their 
confidence riding high.

Earlier this season, the Tritons and Sea Warriors 
engaged in an exhilarating battle that saw UCSD squeak 
past Hawaii Pacific by the slimmest of margins, handing 
the Sea Warriors their first loss of the year thanks to clutch 
performances from junior Anita Athavale and senior 
Tessa Tran. Athavale earned two points for the Tritons by 
winning at No. 2 doubles and coming back from a one-
set-deficit at the No. 3 singles spot. Meanwhile, Tran,
