ANN ARBOR, Mich. -
Sketches by Pablo Picas 0 and 
Henry Moore stolen 28 years 
ago are being returned to the 
University of Michigan. The 
sketches were stolen·from an 
exhibit on loan to Delta 
College in Bay City, Minn., in 
1967. Last week, FBI officials 
in California recovered the 
drawings, which are valued at 
$100,000 each, from the home 
of a Los Angeles woman who 
tried to sell the sketches to a 
consignment agency. The 
woman is not a suspect in the 
thefts, however, and claimed 
she recei ved the sketches from 
a family member.

Student DI •• After 
Fall From Mountain 
MISSOULA, Mont. - A 26-
year-old University of 
Montana student died earlier 
this month after falling more 
than 500 feet from Mount 
Jackson in the Glacier 
National Park. Taggert 
Schubert survived for nearly 
nine hours with a broken leg 
and internal injuries in a snow 
trench before dying. Kyle 
Borchert, 20, lay next to 
Schubert inside a sleeping bag 
to conserve body heat, while 
22-year-old Shad O'Neel 
snowshoed over 12 miles to 
get help. Borchert reached a 
phone near midnight, but the 
rescue had to be put off until 
the next morning because of 
stormy conditions. Schubert 
took on the I O,052-foot peak 
without the aid of ropes 
because of high winds.

Atkinson Strikes Affinnative-Action Deal 
COMPROMISE: 
Implementation of 
SP-l set for spring '98 
By Ivan Delventhal 
News Editor 

Atkinson unveiled a plan a week 
ago which sought to postpone the 
affirmative-action cut, which has a 
start date of Jan. I, 1997, so that 
slightly retooled admissions policies 
would initially affect students seek-
ing admission to the University of 
California for the fall of 1998.

and nine other regents scheduled an

for Jan. 31. to review Atkinson's per-
formance as president. 

on the delayed date of implementa-
tion, and on Monday he dispatched a 
letter explaining his new po ition to 
board members. 

"Afterfunheranalysis. I have con-
eluded that implementation of SP- I 
for undergraduates will be feasible 
effective with the Spring Quarter of 
the 1997-98 academic year," Atkinson 
stated in the letter. "This is because 
there are few applicants; we are deal-
ing mainly with transfer students and 
there is adequate lime to redesign the 
application process." 

Bowing to pressure from both Gov. " I count myself among 
Pete Wilson and members of the UC 
Board of Regents, UC President Ri-
chard Atkinson announced Tuesday 
that affirmative-action-ending mea-
sures will first take effect for students 
applying to the University of Cali for-
nia for Spring Quarter 1998. 

Atkinson justified the delay by 
saying it would take longer than ex-
pected to notify community mem-
bers, college counselors and students 
about the Unjversity of California's 
new admissions policies.

UC Irvine Fertility Scandal Doctor 
Unked to UCSD Medical School 
REVIEW: External finn 
finds improprieties in UCSD 
reproductive-clinic dealing 
By Ivan Delventhal 
News Editor 

Dr. Ricardo Asch, perhaps best known for 
his role in the UC Irvine fertility scandal which 
rocked the UC system last year, was reported 
Tuesday to have illegally provided a University 
of Wisconsin-Madison researcher with repro-
ductive tissue he had obtained while working at 
the UCSD School of Medicine. 

The recent investigation, which was con-
ducted by the independent auditing firm KPMG 
Peat 'Marwick, was undertaken in July 1995 
following allegations of impropriety at UCl's 
Center for Reproductive Health (CRH). 

Asch worked at UCSD for two years, during 

which time he conducted research for the As-
sisted Reproductive Technologies (A.R.T.) pro-
gram. 

Last February, prompted by allegations of 
clinical , fiscal and management misconduct at 
UCI's CRH, university administrators per-
formed an internal investigation which revealed 
that three UCI clinic doctors, including Dr. 
Asch, had taken eggs and embryos from women 
under their care and transferred them to other 
women who were unaware the donors had not 
consented to having their eggs implanted into 
ferti lily patients. 

In December 1995, UCSD School of Medi-
cine administrators learned that 21 fresh. ex-
perimentally inseminated eggs and three fro-
zen, fertilized eggs were provided to a UW 
researcher by Asch .

A team of research scientists at

A.S. Council Suppo~ Lytle's School A.S. MEETING NOTES 
APPROVAL: Caserio 
urged to support 
UCSD charter school 
By Esther Yoon 

Staff~er 
The A.S. Council voiced its advo-

cacy of Marshall College Provost 
Cecil Lytle's proposal foranon·cam· 
pus chaner high school. 

A resolution encoumging Interim 
Chancellor MaJjorie Caserio 10 sup-
port the proposal was passed at last 
night's A.S. Council meeting. 

"I think lhat Provost Lytle has 
made an excellent and intriguing pro-
posal, and that students should come 
out in supponofthis," said A.S. Presi· 
dent Naomi Falk, who authored the 
resolution. 

Lytle spoke at last night's meeting 
to answer questions aboul plans for 
the charter school and to clarify mis· 
understandings. 

The chaner school aims at en· 
abling disadvantaged students from 
the San Diego area to benefil from an 
intensified academic selling. Ulti· 
mately, the students would be better 
prepared for a universilY education 
upon gradualing, according to Lytle. 

"Wewillbe giving tophighschool 
educalion to studenl~ who come from 
a background which couldn 't provide 
this opponunity," Lytie said. 

He added that "the program will 
not guuantee automatic admission to 
UCSD, unlike the misunderstandings 
many people have reached about this 
proposal ." 

Members of the A.S. Council dis· 
cussed several issues- including the 
admissions, funding, liability, magni· 
tude and goals - related to the possi· 
bility of a magnet high school inte· 
grated within the UCSD campus by 
fall of 1997. 

Andy Sutherland, a studenl mem· 
ber of the steering committee for the 
proposed chaner school, expressed 
intent for the proposal 10 establish a 
model of student outreach for other 
universities to follow. 

"One of the moS! intriguing as· 
peets of this program is its 
replicabi lity," Sutherland said. "In the 
long term, other uni versities - espe· 
cially those in urban areas - can use 
UCSD's school as a model." 

Lytle's proposal, which was reo 
viewed by the administralion, awaits 
approval from Case rio before its 
implementation. 

InOlhercouncil news, members of 
lhe A.S. Senate called for an emer· 
gency council meeting last Monday 
to discuss Falk' s veto of a $1 ,684 
allocation for a special election on a 
new constitution.

to have Falk's veto overridden by a 
three·fourths vOle of the A.S. Coun· 
ci I, announced lhe intention of senate 
members to leave the veto as is and to 
petition for the constitution on the 
spring-elections ballot. 

"Many indi viduals were unhappy 
with the concept of a special eleclion 
and therefore transferred that discon· 
tentrnenttoward the docurnentitself," 
Malliarys said. "The senate currently 
has the vOling strength required and is 
willing to override the veto. How· 
ever, I would like to take the time to 
discuss this issue, so that the constitu· 
tion is voted on based on its merits, nOl 
enshrouded by controversy." 

A.S. Vice President Administm· 
tiveJennifer Nicoll, one of the authors 
of the constitution, said Ihal the tim· 
ing of the special election and a veto 
override cou Id create a "logistical 
nighlmare." 

'The veto override would have 
had 10 take place this Wednesday. 
and theelection would have been on 
Feb. 6," Nicoll said . "A week is not 
enough time to throw an election 
logether." 

"Rather than pushing through the 
override and risk losing the document 
and the whole objective in the first 
place, which was to get a new consti· 
tUlion,the senators decided to just not 
go through with it," Nicoll added. "I 
Ihink it was a good decision."

Toney Pines Shuttle Is a 
waste and Should ae Cut 

Two hundred and eighty. That's approximately how many 
people ride the Torrey Pines Center shuttle each day, 

A lone shuttJe bus leaves the Faculty Club parking lot every 
12 minutes for the l.s-mile drive to the Torrey Pines Center, 
home of some of the most overpaid and underworked bureau-
crats in the UC system. The shuttle runs each way five limes 
per hour, 10 hours per day. That's fewer than three people per 
trip, at an average cost of over $200 per day. 

Considering that the new campus entrance will be just 
across the road from the Torrey Pines Center - and consider-
ing that the existing North Parking and Campu Loop shuttle 
stop within a few hundred feet of the center - UCSD Trans-
portation and Parking Services (T &PS) should decommission 
the Torrey Pines shuttle as soon as the entrance is completed. 

Better yet, take the shuttle and put it where it can do some 
good - in the campus loop or in the Medical Center route, 
People have been clamoring for another Medical Center shuttle 
ever since service was reduced by half in August 1994. 

Maybe the real reason the Torrey Pines shuttle survives is 
because the bureaucrats who ride it don't want to give up their 
plush, high-backed, fabric-covered seats and be forced to sit 
next to the assorted rabble, riff-raff and ruffians (read: students) 
who ride the other shuttles. 

T &PS officials - if you're reading this - take the Torrey 
Pines Center shuttle and do something useful with it. Put it 
where it can do the most good for the most number of people. 
Put it on the Campus Loop route. Or put it on the Medical 
Center route. Jusa put il ~ il can actually help the people 
who are paying for it. 

Some of the money to fund the Torrey Pines shuttle comes 
from parking tickets. Some of the money comes from pennit 
sales. And yes, some of the money even comes from the people 
who use the shuttles - bNl not for the Torrey Pines shunle! In 
the end. students pay for everything around here. And as long 
as you're taking their money, you should be doing something 
for'them with it. 

Never Forget That the 
Children Are Our Future 

San Diego teachers may go on strike. But who will the real 
losers be? Not the teachers, because they will probably get at 
least some of their demands. Not the district, because they have 
the pockets to hire emergency subs and to keep things going at 
a "normal" level. The people who will really lose if the San 
Diego Unified School District's more than 6,500 teachers, 
counselors and nurses go on strike are the students - the same 
people who lose out every time the faculty and the administra-
tion can't settle their differences on salaries, benefits or perks. 

School districts have often taken advantage of teachers, and 
this lime is nothing new. The districts have the money, the 
willpower and the sheer manpower to weather and break 
strikes. Cases in which labor wins over management are 
historically few and far between. 

We side with the teachers on this one, San Diego teachers' 
salaries haven't changed since 1991-92, when the teachers got 
a .53 percent raise. That's just slightly more than one-half of 
one percent. A 20-year veteran of the district tops out at 
$48,546, while the district's superintendant - in her third year 
- makes more than three times thai. 

Pert1aps the teachers are making unreasonable demands. 
Think again. Is a phone in every classroom unreasonable? No. 
Is medical, dental and life insurance -like any other profes-
sional job - unreasonable? No. What about locking storage 
cabinets? Once again, the answer is "no." 

The teachers aren't asking for much. The district should 
give Ihem whallhey want. and let them get back to their jobs. 
All our futures, especially thoae of the children who auend

How THE KKK SEES 
nvEACTION 

SADRE: A fictional letter from a former Grand Dragon reveals the 
real winners and losers in the continuing battle over affrrmative action 
IIJP •• c ...... 
Senior Staff Writer 

I have 110 intention of explaining how the following 
cor~lpondence fell in/o my hands. As a columnist, I 
am at the nexus of the strangest flow of news, letters 
and e·mail from a most eclectic collection of individu-
als, It is often said that learning involves forcing stu-
dents to see the world from a different perspective: 
thus, a new perspective on race ~lations. And a hope 
that those with open eyes will learn. 

Grandson: 
Doubtless you are surprised that the man whose fu-

neral you attended but a month ago 
(and whose title you now hold) could 
possibly perform the mortal deed of 
writing a letter. Do not think for a 
minute that the dead can return to the 
land of the living. While I am not at 
liberty to discuss my current where-
abouts, suffice it to say that an eter-
nity awaits for the souls 10 walk the 
earth. 

kangaroo courts, vandalism and cross-burning. With 
the passage of time, these practices became less and 
less acceptable, even in White company. We could no 
longer rely on the cooperation of good White judges, 
jurors or policemen to tum a blind eye to our public 
campaign against the coloreds. The grand counci I (your 
predecessors) met 40 years ago to tackle this question: 
what direction, then, for the modem Klan? 
The C ......... of the Modem KI_ 

The days of lynchings, random beatings and cross-
burnings are over. Klansmen who look fondly at those 
admittedly fun and direct expressions of our rage 

against coloreds cannot serve in the 
leadership of the modem Klan. On July 
22, 1955, the grand council decided to 
move our public campaign against the 
coloreds underground_ As you might 
expect, the decision was not without 
resistance - traditionalists who left 
the Klan suggested that our motiva-
tions were rooled in cowardice and 
nascent sympathies for the coloreds. 

It is painfully clear from your dis-
organized inauguration speech at the 
Trial of Initiation that your under-
standing of Klan ways is more a prod-
uct of media caricatures than faclual 
reality. Your relentless tirade againsl 
affirmative action, among other things, 
bel rays a deep ignorance of the 
struggles your predecessors endured to 
preserve our culture of racial purity 
and White supremacy. As a former 
Grand Dragon of the Klan, I refuse to 
allow decades of our work be de-
stroyed by half-leamed, upstart whelps 
like yourself. 

We wanted the

Nothing, of course, could be further 
from the truth. Our motivations are 
strictly practical. Our mission re-
mained ever the same: the discredit-
ing of colored scientists, scholars and 
talent. Our methods, however, are far 
more pragmatic and elegant. In my 
opinion, it is supremely more satisfy-
ing to see a successful black business-
man, chemist or Supreme Court jus-
tice be maligned and destroyed by his 
own people as a "sell-out" or "Uncle 
Tom" than for any of us to raise a fin-
ger to hurt him,

low Klansman endorse preferential

To this end, one of our crowning 
triumphs was (with the assistance of 
some well-placed infiltrators in the 
colored activist groups) the concept of 
affirmative action. One of the chal -

enemies. Considering the depth to which we obscure 
our motives to the public and even to junior members 
like yourself, this is not surprising. But because you 
are the new Grand Dragon, parroting and believing

HIP-Hop MUSIC CONTAINS SEEDS OF REVOLU'110N 
By Kathleen Lytle 
Staff Writer 

With a bee-bop spirit and hip-
hop lyrics, black youths dance 10 
the rhythm of revolution. Hip-hop 
artisls - as the poels, prophets 
and revolutionaries of a new black 
generation -testify to the'horrors 
of ghello life and catalyze 
America's most dangerous insur-
rection: that of the educated black 
urbanite . 

Hip-hop is popularly criticized 
for tts rhetoric, a revolutionary 
call panicularly feared by those in 
power. Portraying such music as 
totally violent and misogynistic, 
politicians and fanatics attempt to 
strip it of its power and worth as a 
means of social commentary. 
Ghetto music is raw in all its forms 
- progressive and regressive -
although the message does not lie 
on the surface of the lyrics, but 
rather in the understanding of the 
audience, 

Through music, our black an-
cestors left a testimony of their 
lives and engineered uprisings, 
Nineteenth-century slave songs 
provide us with insight inlo an un-
told history revealed by Ihe slaves' 
own words. While slaves perpetu-
ated stereotypes of dancing and 
singing '~igaboos," the content be-
yond the lyrics of Iheir songs 
guided slaves to freedom and 
passed along information about in· 
surrection. 

"Wade in de WMer, children. 

Wade in de water, children. God's 
a gwineter trouble de water." To 
the slave master, Ihis black spin-
tual had a purely Biblical mean-
ing; 10 the slaves, it warned of the 
dangers faced by runaways wad-
ing in the water to throw off pos-
ses and their dogs. Thus, a deeper 
understanding of black music can 
dramatically change its interpre-
tations . 

Blacks living in Ihe struggle of 
modem society now have the re-
sponsibility to decipher the mes-
sage and react the same way the 
slaves did . And, jusl as slave mas-
lers could not understand the 
slaves' songs, Bob Dole and Tip-
per Gore cannot understand hip 
hop. In the present era of neo-co-
lonialism and modern slavery, rap 
music is the descendant of slave 
songs, 

Hip-hop documents the expe-
riences and perspectives of many 
black Americans. For urban blacks 
across the nation, police violence 
is one of the most dependable as-
pects of gQvernmenl. In 1989, 
KRS-ONE of Boogie Down Pro-
ductions asked, "Who Protects Us 
From You?" in response to police 
violence, documenting the siege 
against blacks in the ghetto, His 
words move beyond simple lesli-
mony and into the realm of revo-
lution - every time they inspire 
blacks to defend themselves 
against the police. "Who Protects 
Us From You?" is not simply a 

We are our own 
inventions. 

Just .... ave

song; il is a challenge to crooked 
police officers, 

In 1988, Ice Cube produced 
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, on 

which the lrack, "Endangered Spe-
cies," confronls police Violence. 
"Every cop killer ignoredl They 
just sent another nigga to Ihe 
morguel A point scoredl They 
could give a ruck about us ... Now 
ki II 10 of me 10 gel the job cor-
rectI To serve. prolecl and break a 
nigga's neck." 

This notion is nOI unreasonable 
for people who live in communi-
ties pal rolled like prisons. and 
whose civil rights have been shat-
lered by police batons, time and 
time again, NWA's "Fuck the Po-
lice" and Ice T's "Cop Killer" may 
sound violent and anarchist to an 
unknowing listener, bUI the mes-
sage beneath the rheloric is revo-
lutionary and challenges what has 
become ill1 American Iradition -
the sanctioning of violence and 
terrorism against black people by 
government representati ves. 

Revolution is the latent content 
of hip-hop, which some would like 
to dismiss as violent rhetoric . 
KRS-ONE responds, "When some 
get together and think of rapl They 
tend 10 think of violence.! It's all 
according to your meaning of vio-
lencel And how and in which way 
you use it! By all means necessary, 
il is time to end hypocrisyl What I 
call violence I can't do?1 But your 
kind of violence is stopping me." 

While hip-hop is Ihe contem-
porary forum for young blacks to 
document the conditions of their 
lives, many black women artists 

have also used it to I:ondemn gen-
der-based glass I:eilings in bUSI-
ness and government. In 199', 
Queen Latifah released Black 
Reign, an album which spoke (lut 
againsl such hias . "I represent nut 
only in the kitchen , In Ihe hed-
rooml But, also in the boardroom, 
so give me more rooml Deny my 
opportunity. you In jeopardy." 

Tricia Rose. author of Black 
Noise, described Latifah's release 
of "Ladies First" as "a statement 
for black female unity. indep~n­
dence and power. as well as an 
anti-colonial slatement concerning 
Africa 's soulhern region and Ihe 
recognition of Ihe importance of 
black female political aClivists ... ," 
Latifah challenges tradilional aca-
demic work, which address op-
pression categorically. Black 
women are not affected by race 
one day and gender the next; 
rather, there is a constant and cu-
mulative effect. 

Latifah, along wilh many olh-
ers, wages a psychological bailIe 
against the sexist and racist stereo-
types of black women, S~e con-
sistently confronts the stereotype 
of black women as "hoes." She in-
tellect ually rejects Ii mi lations, 
strives within a male-dominated 
career and succeeds within a while 
male-dominated medium. 

Rap artists give a voice 10 a si-
lenced community. They demand the 
ear of those who do not wanlto listcn

ber of intelligent coloreds whose 
minds would easily eclipse many of 
the mediocre Whites we grudgingly 
count as our own. We thought long 
and hard about this problem and 
fonnulated a two-pronged attack. 
AfIInnetfye Action 

Whatever mild, xenophobic or 
nascent racist inclinations White 
students may have about the 
coloreds quickly erode when placed 
in a situation where they are con-
sistently bested by colored peers or 
whose intellect matches their own. 
With the assistance of the puppets 
(under our directiort) in college 
campuses around the nation, poli-
cies were enacted to ensure a sys-
tematic mismatch of intellectual 
potential of coloreds and the appro-
priate schools. The administrators 
we have successfully deluded into 
thinking they are "helping" non-
whites send the mediocre coloreds 
to colleges for the "bright," the 
bright coloreds to the schools for the 
"exceptional" and the exceptional

coloreds to the universities of "ge-
niuses." 

The purpose of this systematic 
mismatch, of course, is twofold. 
First, we separate Whites from their 
colored intellectual equals . Thus, 
even those not sympathetic to our 
racist beliefs will find that, on aver-
age, the coloreds they talk to are 
their intellectual inferior, amplify-
ing whatcver small prejudices they 
already have and moving them ever 
closer to our beliefs. The second 
purpose is to overwhelm the mis-
placed colored by pulling him in a 
school where he is bested regularly 
by Whites. 

The success of this program can 
be witnessed in the high dropout 
rates among coloreds in elite uni-
versities around the nation. As a fol-
low-up, our propaganda campaign 
encouraged our puppets in coHege 
campuses to parrot the refrain that 
university life was "hostile" to col-
ored students. Admiuedly, we were 
worried that students in universities 
which were 20 to 40 percent non-
white would not buy such an outra-
geous lie, but it appears as if non-
whites are even less intelligent than 
we anticipated. 

I tell you, grandson, nothing ter-

gcnder tcnsions will not only look to 
govemmcnt documents and academic 
studies, but also to rap music.

Martin Luther King, Jr. asked, "How

coloreds going to schools which

This would allow them to study hard

EthnIc N8rClasism 

You might be surprised tO'learn 
that terms like "race traitor" and the 
(modem) use of the expression 
"Uncle Tom" were engineered by 
us. We wanted the coloreds to wal-
low in their race, be consumed with 
it and invest their entire sense of 
self-worth in being "ethnic." This 
way, they will define themselves not 
by what's between their ears, but 
rather by the particular shade of 
their skin. 

To that end, we have secretly 
funded militant ethnic activists like 
the Chicano Moratorium Commit-
tee and the Black Panthers. We have 
encouraged them to be publicly 
brash and menacing and to privately 
cultivate an environment which ac-
cuses non-militant cultural mem-
bers of being "sell-outs" or "white 
sympathizers," knowing full well 
that it will ultimately frighten oth-
erwise sympathetic Whites to our 
side. The last thing we want is open 
dialogue between our people and the 
colored.

paranoid black culture which believes 
society -is rigged against them, and 
which accuses those who work hard 
academically of "acting White." More 
importantly, we must impart upon this 
culture the curious species of blind-
ness which allows it to simultaneously 
believe it is racist to generalize and 
say things like "Blacks youths play 
basketball," yet at the same time find 
nothing wrong lambasting 
"Eurocenlric" values (as if the French, 
Swedes, Itali ans, Spaniards and 
Greeks have anything in common, 
aside from sharing a continent). The 
destruction of colored ambition is 
most effectively brought about when 
the colored cat their own and believe 
themselves to be victims of a hope-

will end mce- and gender-based uni-

meeting. 

As the forum continued, discus-

versity, including faculty retirements . 

According to Dynes, concern over 
Ihc loss of faculty members to the 
Voluntary Early Retirement Incen-
tive Program is unfounded. 

"This isa very strong campus," he 
said. ' 'There was conccrn with the 
recent retirements of a number of

meeting canceled 
Continued from page 1 

According to the UC Office of Ihe 
President, a lotal of 2,238 students 
applied for admission 10 the Uni ver-
sity of alifornia for the spring of 
1995, most of whom were commu-
nity-collegestudenlson translcragrec-
ments, while 72,509 students applied 
for frcshman admission for the fall of 
1995. 

In llddition, Atkinson sent a letter 
to Wilson on Monday reiterating hi s 
commitment to full y implementing 
the regents' resolutions. 

''Thert; is no queslion in my mind 
thaI it is the constitutional duty of the 

. board to sel policy for the uni versity, 
and the role of the president i to 
implement Ihat policy," Atkinson's 
leller stated. 

" I have a legal duty , as well as 
a moral obligation, to do so," the 
leiter continued. 

Atkinson's dccision to move up 
the implementation date was well -
received by Connerly, who had criti: 
cized the UC president a week ear-
lier. 

"I believe Ihere is no longer a 
need for the special meeting of the 
Board of Regents called for on 
Wednesday 10 review the perfor-
mance of UC President Richard C. 
Atkinson," Connerly said in a state-
ment released Monday. 

"Given the very gracious and fully 
explanatory leiters sent today from 
the president to the regents and to the 
governor, I believe the governance 
issue has been resolved," added 
Connerly. 

As of late Monday, the special 
meeting scheduled for Wednesday 
was called off. 

Student Regent Ed Gomez, who 
has been an outspokcn opponent of 
Ihe regents' movc to end UC affirma-
live-ac ti on poli cies, criti c ized 
Atkinson for"buckling undcrthe prcs-
surc." 

"Atkinson ... allowed the Univcr-
sily of California to be uscd as a 
political pawn in Wilson 's campaign 
10 spread hate and exclusion through-
oul Ihc state of California," Gomez 
said. 

While the ncw implcmentation 
date reprcsenLs a compromise hctwccn 
Alklnson and the regents, UCSD ad-
missions officials indicated that the 
most recent date set by Atkinson is 
moreofa symbolic gesture hccause of 
the relatively few number of admis-
sions for Spring Quarter.

si~nal students will be effective for

"In many ways, we're stronger 
now because we have more youth in

overall financial-aid picture is not

"If nothing is done at this point,

he said. 

Other issues the 25 students at 
the meeting discussed included fac-
ulty accessibility; the development 
of Rooseve It Colle~e; Marshall Col-
lege Provost Cecil Lytle 's proposed 
on-campus charter high school; 
O.A.S.I.S . and Summer Bridge pro-

"We don't want this place to be-
come a UCLA, where students are

environmenl," he said. 

Dynes added that a pennanent 
Roosevelt College will be built in the 
area now occupied by North Parking. 
The currenl Roosevelt residence halls 
and surrounding buildings will serve 
as a "transitory" area for the proposed 
sixth college.

"Because we won't be having fee

be improved as il would havc been

SCANDAL: 
Asch terminated in 
June of last year 
Continued from p.,. 1 
ies on the mechanism of fertiliza-
tion, consisted of nonviable tis-
sue, as well as viable eggs which 
could potentially have been used 
in A.R.T. procedures. 

According to the study, Asch 
assured UCSD and UW officials 
that hc had obtained appropriate 
Human Subjects Commillee ap-
proval for this research , when it 
appears he did nol. 

Asch was a professor of obstet-
ric~ and gynecology at UCI and a 
director of the university's CRH 
when he was appointed as a non-
~alaried clinical professor at UCSD 
in February 1993. He held the po-
sition at UCSD until June 30, 1995, 
when his appointment wa~ not re-
newed. 

During his time at UCSD, Asch 
evaluated and managed patients in 
the A.R.T. program approximately 
four times a year, participating in 
seven different treatment series in-
volving 155 patients. 

"When we learned early in this 
investigation that reproductive tis-

sues, which normally would be 
discarded, were used in research 
without a protocol approved by 
UCSD's Human Subjects Com-
millee, we were concerned and 
dismayed," Acting Chair of 
UCSD's Department ofReproduc-
tive Medicine Thomas Moore, 
M.D., said . 

" However, we were further 
shocked when we were informed 
last month that Dr. Asch appears 
to have provided viable reproduc-
tive material without consent or 
approval. If indeed this occurred, 
this is a blatant breach of estab-
li shed policies and procedures, as 
well as an ethical outrage," Moore 
added. 

It has not been possible to estab-
lish if the froren specimens ~upphed 
to UW by Asch were from UCSD 
A.R.T. patients or brought to UCSD 
from other clinics operated by Asch. 

However, all A.R.T. patients 
have been notified of Asch's al-
leged misconduct and have been 
asked to call the A.R.T. program if 
they would like to individually 
discuss their concerns. 

Asch has been living in Me"ico 
si nce late la t year, and he has not 
responded to university allega-
tions.

The UCSD Guardian 

Among other findings in the 
recent study: 

• Administrative, operational 
and financial relationships be-
tween Asch and UCSD were not 
clearly laid out. 

• Patient consent for A.R.T. pro-
cedures was not clearly documented. 

• The A.R.T. tissue bank was 
not licensed in accordance with 
state requirements. A license has 
since been granted. 

"In developing the initial fi-
nancial and administrative ar-
rangements with Dr. Asch and hi s 
team, his lengthy experiencc man-
agi ng an assisted reproductive 
technologies program at another 
UC campus, hi s seniority and his 
stellar reputation wcre taken into 
consideration," Moore said . "In 
retrospect, it appear~ that the trust 
that wa~ placed in Dr. Asch wa 
unfoundcd." 

The first phase of UCSD's re-
view, completed and released by 
KPMG in July, focused 011 patient 
records and revealed the transfer 
of eggs without appropriate con-
sent involving five A.R.T. patients. 

The second phase of the review 
found no additional occurrences 
of unauthorized egg or embryo 
transfer between patients.

ERHAPS BEST KNOWN AS AN 80's TEEN-
age pop icon, Debbie Gi bson changes 
gears to play the tough girl , Rizzo, in 

a theatrical version of "Grease! ," which 
opens on Tuesday for an eight-perfor-
mance run at Copley Symphony Hall. 
Sally Struthers and Adrian Zmed also star 
in this national touring production. Gibson, 
25, released an album of ballads last year 
and provided guest vocals on the last 
album by the punk band, Circle 
Jerks. During a recent phone in-
terview, she spoke about her in-
terest in "Grease!" and her desire 
to continue her singing career. 
Guardian: How cid you get 
your role in "Grease!"? 

Gibson: It started a few years 
ago when the producers asked 
me about playi ng Sandy. I ended 
up doing a production in En-
gland, first as Sandy. When that 
was done, the producers ap-
proached me again and asked if! 
would like to play Rizzo. I loved 
that idea. I felt a little schizophrenic at 
first, but I love it. 
What do you tink .... tains inter-
est in "G ...... !"? 

Adults come because they remember 
the '50s. People in their 20s grew up with 
the film. Teenagers know about the en-
ergy of the songs. People laugh at differ-
ent jokes depending on which age groups 
are there. 
How have previous performances 
been received? 

It's been great.} think that people,just 

from my appearance, assume that I am 
much more like Sandy. I guess in a lot of 
ways I am, but I have a sassy side I really 
get to unleash in this production. I think 
that has been the surprise for people. I've 
gotten good reviews, but J could tell the 
reviewers didn't expect it. 
Have you done any theater prior 
to this? 

[couldn't even name all the musicals 
I've done. I did theater as a kid for 10 
years.

z.ealous efforts to make his love feel 
secure end up searing her off. Like-
wise, Masterson turns in an excellent 
performance as a charming, yet vul-
nerable woman who is beset by self-
doubt and fear in the face of true love. 

The film makes an important 
point: The rewards of confronting the 
complications of real love make it 
beller than a safe fantasy. The only 
major defecl of Bed of Roses is its 
shrill soundtrack, which is unsuitable 
to the subtle subject matter.

SASSY: Gibson 
will keep recording 
Continued from peg. H9 
business; I just like 10 make my mu-
sic. I'd like to be able to incorporate 
both theater and recording. 
How do you look INIck upon 
your ............. ? 

You've stumped me. ]t wasn't 
like it was a big surprise success 
story. It was a step-by-step process 
over four or five years. It wasn'tlike 
I woke up one day and found myself 
on stage at Madison Square Garden. 
I started at Jocy 's Place in New Jer-
sey performing for 20 people. I look 
back upon it, and I think that I've 
experienced stuff people wouldn 't 
believe and SlUff people my age 
wouldn'thaveexperienced. 1t ' kind 
of wild because it 's given mea healthy 
perspective on life and on people in 
general. I've learned so much about 
people at an early age. I thank God ( 
had my family.) could haveendcd up 
as a brat. 
What initially influenced you 
to become a sinpr? 

A huge influence on me was 
"Annie."Oneofmy fi rst goals was to 
beon Broadway because I remember 
seeing kids my age on stage doing it. 
Then, I can remember when I first 
started writing songs when I was 12 
years old. I can remember the feeling 
of knowing that my songs would end 
up on the radio. 
Your first aIJum came out 
when you were 16. Do you 
think yow f ... came too 
e.ty? 

No. Ithi nk every thing was mapped 
ou t for me. For me, it wasn't too 
early. Some kjds who are eight years 
old are more stable than some 40-
year-olds r know. It depends on the 
person. At 16 ( was very much ready 
for it. 
Do you feel like you have to 
overcome your past? 

I' m constantly balliing a prob-
lem of perception. That's why I 
love performing every day. You 
can talk about what you do all you 
like, but it's not until people see 
what you do live that they can un-
derstand it. I'm not worried about 
it. I thinkit'ssomethingthat changes 
over a long time. My fans who have 
been with me don ' t have that prob-
lem. But those who aren't in touch 
with the musie business have it. 
They only have the really bold im-
ages that hit them in the face . Most 
of the images that hit them arc of 
me as a teen pop sensation. 
Alani. Morissette has had to 
bury her past as a teen singer. 
Do you think that's a wise 
move? 

To her, it seems really honest; but 
for me, I'm really not angst-ridden. 
I'm really not angry. 1'm basically a 
happy person. I don't feel the need to 
do that. 
What was it h'ke singing with 
the Circle Jerks? 

It was hilarious. It was a total 
nuke. I was in L.A. when they were 
in L.A. They asked if I would be 
interested in singing on a track; and 
I'm up for anything, usually, so I said 
sure. What amazed me about those 
guys was that I hey were like an over-
grown garage band. Theydidn 'teven 
know how to order lunch, but they 
make these cr.ll.Y, energetic records. 
]t was really, really fun . 
Do you •• have a perfume? 

I did. It was called Electric Youth. 
Allhetime, il wasperfecl.1l waspink 
and fruily . It went over very well, bUI 
it was a thing of the time. It was

Boys Become Men in 
White Squall 

Actor SCbtt Wolf discusses his 
role in Ridley Scott's new film 

By .Jeft NIeMI 
Hiatus Editor 

Actor Scott Wolf is quickly estab-
lishing himself as a celeb-
rity. As Chuck Gieg in 
Ridley SCOII' s new sea ad-
venture, White Squall, 
Wolf comes off as a good-
natured, tru tworthy pro-
tagoni st. Meanwh ile , 
"Party of Five," the TV 
series in he whil,;h stars, 
just won a Golden Globe 
Award. In a recent roundtable discu -
sion at the Ritz. Carlton Hotel in Ma-
rinadelRey, Wolf,27,saidhedocsn't 
quileconsiderhimselffamous.Sqllall, 
a film based on a true story about 13 
boys who sail through the South Pa-
ci fic and Caribbean during the 1960s, 
would have been a challenging role 
for any actor. In one pi votal scene, the 
boat encounters a mythic "white 
squall," and allthe crew members are 
washed overboard. In the final scene, 
the boat's captain (Jeff B ridges) is put 
on lrial, and the boys have to decide 
whether to support him. The movie 
opens tomorrow at theaters through-
out San Diego. 
Guardian: What did you learn 
about yourself during the 
making of the movie? 

Wolf: I learned thallhe moralityof 
the film is something thaI' s really 
important to me in my life. I take it for 
granted at times. The story we tell in 
the film is of a simpler time when 

everything that is truly good and hu-
man comes out of our connection with 
other people. What you yield from 

panicipating in a group is 
far greater than what you 
could ever yield on your 
own. Being out on Ihe 
occan filming with all these 
guys paralleled the tory. 
II made the filming an ad-
venture for us all. It was 
just interesting to see how 
we bonded as a group,just 

like the guys in the movi~did. 1 don't 
know how to explain that. Part of it is 
the chemistry in the group, in which 
there was no competition. 
But you've emerged as the 
star. 

I don't know how comfortable I 
am with thaI. The fact that l' m telling 
thestory may makethe audience think 
that I'm the central character. BUI 
everyone on the film worked as hard 
as everyone else. 
Does that mean you don't want 
to be a star? 

It's hard to be objective on how I 
emerge from the film. My role is a 
little more central and focused upon. 
If people respond well to what I'm 
doing, then I' m a happy camper. I f the 
response I get from this IiIm means 
that I will be able to do more work, 
then) embrace it. Am ] comfortable 
with the word, "star"? Not really. 
Are you comfortable with the 
comparisons to Tom Cruise?

Calm before the storm: While on the Albatross , a boat that serves as a prep school , Chuck Gieg (Scott Wolf) takes 
instructions from the Skipper (Jeff Bridges) in White Squall. 

It 's been around so long. it's like 
an old friend . I have never aClually 
methim, butI'd love to meel him. I'm 
a fan, and I like his work. 
You also work with a great 
group on "Party of F'we." 

I'm scared to death thai I'm get-
ting my best work experience out of 
the way too early. It 's going to be 
downhill from here. It has hcen a 
pleasure to go to work. 
What is the journey of se"· 
discovery for Chuck? 

[ think he starts at a point of isola-
tion, which I think is really important 
right now because people are lost and 
don't know what it means to be ac-
countable tootherpeople. Chuck gocs 
off to find his own way. Through a 
series of events, he makes connec-
tions with others. He becomes the 
center of the group and linds his own 

values. When those arc ripped out 
from underhim, he truly finds himself 
by reclaiming tho e values and refus-
ing to let them go. 
You grew up on the New Jer. 
say shore. Did you have any 
parallel experiences while 
growing up? 

No, I had a lillie hoating experi-
cnce. When I was IS, we ran aground 
and my mom was thrown across the 
cabin. It scarred me in a way. Being 
around the crew Illemhcrs of the ~hip 
on the SCI, [ leamed [0 ~pel,;tthe sea. 
You must respeci it because its power 
is awesome. and you have no control 
over it. That 's one of the underlying 
themes of the film. Natural forces 
exist which arc unaware of the pres-
ence of humans; and when you cross 
paths, you' re in for it. 
What was it like to meet the 

CHI IS FARLEY 

actual person you portray? 
I was intimidated at first because 1 

felt that lowed him the service of " 
portraying him as he was. He put me 
at case because he knew that I was 
going to create a chamcler. He helped 
my understanding of what it was like 
to live through. ! 
Has yOW' life chanced with 
your recent fame? 

My day-to-day life hasn't changed 
much. I'm ~till abk to live my life the 
way r want to. I can go to movies and 
go out to eal. The difference is Ihat 
people know J' m doing it and watch. 
Early on, my focus would shift around 
the room. Lillie by lillie, it got to the 
point that I' m able to ignore the stuff 
that goes on around me. It can be , -
intrusive, but it's a small price to pay 
to do something that I love to do for a 
living.

Courtesy of 
Enllahtenlna: Robert Merivel (Robert Downey, Jr.) befriends an Irish woman (Meg Ryan) in Restoration. 

.Restoring the 17th Century 
Robert Downey, Jr. heads an all-star cast in the 

visuallyappealingfilm Restoration 
By Elysia 'aladlno 
Guardian Reporter 

DircctorMichael Hoffman's Res-
/oratiun is a visually stun-
ning (jIm set in England's 
Restoration period. The 
film's narrative elements, 
such as the storyline and 
character developmenl, 
are hoth pleasing and pal -
atable, yet these elements 
seem 10 pale in compari-
son to the awesome spec-
tacle within which they are sel. 

Res/oratiun is essenlially an epic 
journey through 17th-century En-
gland under the newly reSlored mon-
arehyof KingCharles II (Sam Neill). 
The story cenlers around one man's 
coming-of·age in an era of change 
and Enlightenment. 

Robert Merivel (Robert Downey, 
lr.) is an ordinary young man faced 
with the decisions of adulthood. 
Merivel must decide whether to fol -
low his father's wishes 10 continue 
studying medicine or to become a 
serviceman of the king. 

King Charlcs II then offcrs 
Merivel another choice; hc can be-
come a great hcro or a common fool. 
Merivcl's trials and travels take him 

to the king's court, where he earns 
his own estate, only to lose it and 
end up treating asylum patients. 

After meeting Katherine 
(Meg Ryan), a bewildered 
Irish woman, he eventu-
ally arrives in the plague-
infested city of London. 
Here he comes face-to-
face with the city's Greal 
Fire of 1666. His journey 
through life comes full-
circle when he realizes 

what aspects of life are really im-
portant to him. 

Both Downey and Neill give 
pleasing performances, as do the 
majority of the actors in the movie. 
Polly Walker plays a fierce Lady 
Celia, the headstrong mistress of 
King CharlesIl. Ryan gives a some-
what comical performance of 
Katherine, who is stuck in a with-
drawn state of despair over being 
abandoned by her husband. 

And theatrical great, Sir Ian 
McKellan, (Six Degrees o/Separa-
tion) gives a touching performance 
as Will Gates, Merivel's wise and 
ever-faithful servant. But Hugh 
Grant (Sense and Sensibility, Four 
Weddings and a Funeral) disap-

points as the portrait artist Finn, 
providing little more than comic 
relief and an apologetic acting style. 

But the overall impact of the IiIm 
does not rely on its storyline or cast 
of characlers . Rather, it is derived 
from the (jIm's visual appeal, made 
possible by those working behind-
the-scenes. Production designer 
Eugenio Zaneui's (Flatliners, Last 
Actiun Hero ) period sets are awe-
inspiring, especially his rendition of 
the king 's castle. His seuings are 
enhanced by the incredible, dramatic 
and mood-inspiring cinematography 
of Oliver Stapleton (Absolute Be-
ginners, The Grifters). 

lames Acheson (The Last Em-
peror, Dangerous Liaisons) has 
designed costumes which vary from 
the elaborately ornate apparel of the 
king' s court to the dreary, tattered 
wear of the Puritan townspeople. 
The music of James Newton (The 
Fugitive , Prince a/Tides) also var-
ies between the festive and the som-
ber, keeping within the baroque style 
of the period. These details of a film 
often go unnoticed, but in Restora-
tion, they cry out for attention . 

Restoration opens tomorrow at 
the Hillcrest Cinemas.

TM Cult 0/ Ray is an impetuous 
album, a lOCket ride through the uni-
verse of lOCker Frank Black. It's a 
universe in which loud dis-
torted guitars and off-the-
wall lyrics pay homage to 
Ray Bradbury, Elvis 
Costello, Mexican food, 
punk rock and Los Angeles 
I.;ulture. 

Ray is Black's third solo

ings label and the first time in his 
career Black has had complete and

total control over the entire recording 
process. 

His first two albums, Frank Black 
(I 993) and TU1IIlgerofthe 
Year (1994), were impres-
sive, but somewhat disap-
pointing in light of his ear-
lier work with the Pixies. 

Heestablishedhisrepu· 
lation as the creati ve ge-
nius Black Francis, the 
leader of the Pixies, a band 
thal Nirvll1l, REM, U2 and 

David Bowie all proclaimed as their 
favorite. Afier his comparatively drab 

solo releases, he had fans wondering 
ifit was really Kim DeaI who supplied 
the magic to the Pixies' scund. 

Ray is a much better. album than 
either of his first two. It was recorded 
almost entirely live, with a raw ener-
getic sound reminiscent of the Pixies' 
last album, Trompe u Monde. Don '[ 
think that Ray is some Pixies rehash, 
though. For long-time fans, it's time 
to stop' blaming him for not being 
Black Francis. Appreciate him as the 
"pure Frank" he so thoroughly enjoys 
being.

Fuck the Scene, but still 
manages to pil in the 
face of convention. With 
antics such as getting 
thrown inlo a TJ drunk 
tank overnight, 
Mirainga's got the im-
age it 's searching for-
but how doe the musie 
measure up'! 

Why MCA gave this 
punk quartet a contract 
is somewhat of a mys-
tery, but the words "cash 
cow" do come to mind. 
Best known for "Burn-
ing Ruhber," a song 
which was included 011 
the Ace Ventura 
sou ndtrack, Mirainga 
has received steady play 
on the radio and MTV. 

The band just might be the next Rancid, 
even though it sound s nothing like the 
punkers from the north Bay Area scene. 
Mirainga's s lower tempo may disappoint 
the community of speed freaks, possi bly 
encouraging them to search elsewhere. 

Although a bit heavy 
on the conventional "alterna-rock" sound , 
the LP has its moments: The catchy "57 
South" is one highlight. Although it's a cut 
above the norm , Mirainga doc n'l quite 
satiate an appetite for something really dif-
ferent. 

The name of the group's self-titled de-
but lacks the cajones of its previous EP, 

Mr. Mirainga will perform an all-ages 
show tomorrow at the SOMA sidestage.

Golden Smog 
Down by the Old Mainstream 

Rylcodlsc 

Set back by the mys-
terious disappearance of 
its original drummer four 
years ago, Golden Smog 
(featuring members of 
Soul Asylum, Wileo and 
Ihe Jayhawks usi ng 
pseudonyms) has finally 
regrouped and rclea~cd its 
fir t full-length album. 

The Minneapolis sex-
tet speeiali7es in the jangly fo lk rock which 
has made stars out of fcllow Minnesota na-
lives, the Replacements. 

Its guitar- and harmonica-driven music 
delves into life's tri als and trivialities . "V" 
focuses upon Ihe sympathet ic nature of the 
local coffee-shop waitress("When I wasdownl 
She was full of adviccl Said she's been there 
oneeor twice."), while " He's a Dick" is fairly 

self-explanatory. 
Although the musi-

cians play with both skill 
and emotion, their debut 
doesn't stretch theband's 
talent all that far. 

The musicians have 
found a pleasant groove, 
but Down By the Main-
s/ream could use a few 
more up-tempo numbers 

like "Red Headed Stepchild" to add orne 
energy to the album. 

Despite the edate nature of most of the 
record, the band manages to incorporate all of 
the members' ski ll s into a cohesive sound; the 
best example of which is their sly interplay on 
the elegant, piano-hi gh lighted "Nowhere 
Bound."

A kinder and gentler Smashing Pumpkins hit 
highs and lows at SOMA Live 

]n a recent interview, Pavement drummer 
Steve West said that the thing he doesn't like 
about Smashing Pumpkins' singer-guitarist Billy 
Corgan is thai Corgan doesn't 
appear to have a good time when 
he performs. Although Corgan 
was cantankerous enough at the 
band's last San Diegoappcarance 
(two years ago on the Lollapalooza tour) to drive 
most ofthe audience to the ex liS, at the first of two 
sold-outs shows at SOMA Live on Tuesday 
night, he appearcd genuinely upbeat, particularly 
during the~mi'luteacoustic segment that kicked 
off the epic, two-and-a-half hour concen (with a 
20-minute intennission). 

For the acoustic segment, band members 
donned pajamas, giving the II -song set the feel 
of a nighttime lullahy. The crowd, perhaps used 
to SOMA's usual mosh pits, was a bit impatient 
with the performance. And rightly so. While the 
gentler moments on tbe band 's recent 28-song, 
double album, Mellon Collie and the llIfinite 
Sadlless, are some of the release's highlights, the 

acoustic set wasoftendull. Atonepoinl, Corgan 
even reprimanded the crowd, saying "You're 
Califomians. Chill the ruck OUL" 

One highlight was an 
acoustic version of "Rocket." 
As Corgan twisted his bald, 
turtle-like head, he gave the 
impression that be was trying 

to reach out 10 his audience, a quality for which 
he is not known. 

When the band returned after a 20-minute 
intermission. it was ostensibly to plug in its 
electric guitars and kick out the jams. And 
while hits like "Cherub Rock," ''Today'' and 
" 1979" soared, Corgan's often self-indulgent 
guitar solos and vocal phrasings quickly be-
came annoying. For an encore, the band again 
lightened the mood as Corgan appeared with a 
towel wrapped around his head and even swung 
hiS arm around the neck of guitarist James Iha. 
On the whole the concert was much like its 
latest album - a mixed bag of highs and lows.

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP CLAWED: Tigers top UCSD 
Rugby . 
The UCSD Rugby team is on 

a roll. 
Actually . that's an understate-

ment. Outseoring its 
last three opponents 
by a score of I 19-
20, the squad has 
been playing great 

rugby of late. 
Last weekend. it was UC 

Riverside's tum to feel the hun, as 
UCSD jumped on top early and 
shut the opposition out, 55-0. 

UCSD stayed undefeated in 
league play with great play from 
its forwards , who dominated the 
feild convincingly enough to al-
low the backs to capitalize on scor-
ing chances. 

UC Riverside never had a 
chance agai nst the red-hot ruggers, 
as UCSD moved to 2-0 in league 
play, 

Scoring was abundant and came 

from many sources, 
Troy "Helen" Meyer led the 

way with two tries. He was fol-
lowed closely by a list of players 
who scored a try . 

Joe "Happy" Lange, Dave 
"Love Shack" Shackleford, Dave 
Owens, Mark "Baldy" Bazzell, 
Chay Chang, Mi ke Cummings and 
Shammas "Velvet" Brown each 
had one try. 

"This game, at least in the first 
half, shows what our team is ca-
pable of," Bob Bouton said . "Next 
week we are going to be tested by 
UC Irvine. I expect that we will 
rise to the challenge." 

With a win, UCSD assures it-
self a spot in the Southern Califor-
nia Collegiate Playoffs. Play will 
begin at I p.m. at Warren West 
Field against the tough division 
rival.

I knew he was released too." 

Miyake has learned that it's a 

eryday." 
There's no doubt that making 

it to the big leagues is a tough task, 
but Miyake knows one thing for 
sure: There are a lot of people who 
would die to be in his shoes. 

"I realize the opportunity that I 
have," Miyake said. "Everybody 
keeps telling me '1 wish ] was 
there.' I just wanted to play co l-
lege baseball. and now I have a 
chance to keep playing. I'm not 
playing for the money. I am play-
ing because llove it." 

In this day and age of money-
driven sports. it's nice to know 
that for every Ken Griffey Jr., 
there are thousands of Chris 
Miyakes - athletes who endure 
so much, just to play the game 
they love, and to maybe one day 
have a shot at The Show. 

Ultimate Disc 
The UCSD Air Squids Ultimate 

Dise team got its season on track on 
Jan. 20-21 at UC Santa Barbara 

stormy throughout the 
weekend, with foreboding clouds 
and occasional bursts of rain . On 
Saturday, Jan, 20, the Squids split 
into two teams of equal strength -
the X team led by Ben Fi nkelor and 
the Y team led by Chris Weaver. 

The X team had a tough time 
against solid clubs from Cal Poly 
San Louis Obispo. Berkeley and 
Oregon State, but it lost competi-
tive games by a margin of only a 
couple of points. 

The Y team fared much beller. 
crushing Cal Tech, losing to a tough 
Stanford squad and squeaking by 
Santa Barbara in a close, intense 

HERO: Despite 
mistakes he's mine 
Continued from pace 20 
to be counted. He had hurt his fans 
and those who loved him. 

But he rebounded. He became a 
shining presence off the coun. He 
was the man with the smile again, 
butldidn ' t know what tothink. Was 
it O.K. to look up 10 him for making 
lhe best of what had happened 10 
him? What he had done to himself! 

I still felt something inside when 
1 saw him smiling and chatting eom-
fortably with the vultures of my 
profess ion. But it wasn't admiration 
anymore. II was confusion. If he 
could have been such a disappoint-
ment, what of my other heroes? 
Would they disappoint me as well? 

Gradually, I begin to admire him 
again. I couldn't be angry with him. 
His smile ensured that. I begin to 
wish he could play . But I didn't 
think it possible. There were players 
in the league who spoke out against 
him. They hurt him, and he stayed 
away. He was an outcast from the 
very game that gave him life and 
inspired him. The game through 
which he inspired others. fans, like 
myself. 

His team moved on without him. 
It became talented once again and I 
cheered. Butl didn't feel the same 
passion as when his smile had led 
the way to victories.

game. 
Because of the strong play from 

the Y team, the Squids advanced to 
the elimination round on Sunday. 
The veterans and inexperienced 
players divided to make a strong A 
team and a young B team. 

The A team stayed with Santa 
Barbara's A team for most of the 
game, bUl eventually lost, 13-S. 

"This is the first realtoumament 
of the season," Finkelor said. "With 
continued practice and experience, 
we look forward to avenging our 
loss to Santa Barbara by beating 
them at Scctionals and Regionals." 

This upeoming weekend, a squad 
of veteran Squids will travel to 
Tempe, Ariz. for a tournament. 
Along with the veterans, four first-
year players will also make the trip: 
Jim Chen, Alex Dars. Ed Price and 
Jason Sarouhan.

r lost count of the number of times 
he was rumored to be retuming. [ no 
longer paid anention when the head-
lin ... ~ vigorously touted his second 
coming. And then, he came back. 

I didn't know whether to believe 
il. But there he was, urrounded by 
the media, lighting up the room and 
their microphones with his presence 
and the promise that it would once 
again grace a basketball court. And 
only a day later, he was on the hard-
wood once again. 

Actually. he came off the bench. 
Something he would never have 
done in his former playing days. 
Not because he wouldn't have been 
willing to be a substitute. He would 
have done anything fOrlhc leam. He 
came off the bench because that is 
what the coach war.ted. After all, he 
hadn ' t played in an NBA game in 
over four years . He had to be rusty. 

BUI when he stood up with just 
minutes gone in Ihe first quarter, Ihe 
entire audience stood with him and 
cheered voraciously. He tore off his 
warm-ups, revealing the golden 
number 32 that also hung in the 
rafters as a reminder of his former 
glory. He smiled. He was back. 

After the game, he smi led some 
more as he hugged his teammates, 
his coach, his opponents. Anyone 
who would open their arms to him. 
He was clearly hJippy to be back. 
And I was happy to see him back. 
Why? 

Because, he is my hero. 

ContInued from paee 20 
been huning UCSD in the middle 
- to make the score 8-11 . 

Sophomore Guy Mount then 
connected with You on a nicely 
timed quick set, a play which 
worked throughout the night for 
the Tritons. Mount erushed the 
ball into the floor to bring the 
UCSD squad within two, 9-11. 

A hilling error by Princeton 
gave the Tritons hope of complet-
ing the comeback, as they closed 
the gap to 10-11 ; however, the 
Tigers then slammed the door by 
tallying the last four points of the 
game, including a solid block of 
UCSD's Black on game point. 

Black's frustration at game's 
end was evident, and perhaps it 
was this emotional energy which 
catapulted the Tritons out of the 
gatcs in the fourth set. UCSD 
bolted out to a 4-0 lead and held 
off the Tigers for much of the 
game, but Princeton rallied to knot 
the score, II-II, prompting 
Dannevik to call timeout in order 
to gather up his troops. ... 

The game finally went the Tri-
tons' way, when Eggers was again 
the victim of a huge solo block., 
this time by Mount who did his 
best impression 0' Bruce Lee in 
hiscelcbration followingtbe point. 
That made the score, 16-15, in 
favor of UCSD. 

Black tallied one of his match-
high 35 kills on the very next 
point, soaring in to spike the ball 
off Ihe top of a Tiger blocker's 
oUl5tretched hands. 

The Tritons seemed to have 
the right attitude going into game 
five, which was played under rally 
scoring. 

They came out solidly, tally-
ing points easily in the middle on 
quick sets from You to Jeffcoat 
and Mount. UCSD took the first 
break, when Black and Mount re-
jected Princeton's Jeff Cooper to 

• jump to a 6-4 lead. 
But the Tritons' joy was short-

Ii ved. The Tigers quickly captured 
six oflhe next eight points. One of 
those points came on a controver-
sial non-call in which a Princeton 
blocker appeared to touch an at-
templed ki II by Jeffcoat. 

The Tritons got no closer than 
10-9, as the Tigers continued at-
tacking with a well-rounded of-
fensive onslaught. Leading killer 
Joe Wimbish eventually put the 
game away with his team-high 
26th kill, ending UCSD's hopes 
of a breakthrough win.

Tritons Ransack Jersey, Survive to Tell 
ON THE ROAD AGAIN: UCSD concluded its trip to New York by taking on William Paterson 
College of New Jersey on Monday and raising its record to 12-5 with an 80-70 triumph 

(J 

By Robin KeziNn 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team wrapped up its whirl-
wind East Coast road trip at Wil-

liam Paterson Col: 
lege in Wayne , 
New Jersey on 
Monday nighl. 

The Tritons 
traveled across thc 
country, lost a 
hard-fought con-
tcst to Defiance 

Collegt, steam rolled their oppo-
nents from York, saw the sights 
of the Big Apple and arrived at 
Paterson - all within a five-day 
time-span. 

Needless to say, fatigue was a 
major obstacle for the UCSD 
women to overcome in Monday 
night's matchup. Playing Pater-
son, with its infamous dark, noisy 
gym made UCSD's 80-70 victory 

over the Jersey squad an even 
greater achievement. 

"We played a good game," Tri-
ton assistant coach Stacey Patsko 
said. "We were tired, but we stepped 
up and were able to negate [their 
home-court advantage]." 

The Tritons took control of the 
match early on, outscoring Pater-
son, 20-10, in the first period. 
Typical of its offensive strategy 
all season, 
UCSD spread 
t he ball arou nd 
and posted big 
numbers from 
inside and the 
perimeter. 

UCSD for-
ward Sarah 
Schneider and center Tianna Mi-
rage overpowered the Paterson 
defenders. Schneider led the Tri -
tons with 16 poi nts and eight re-
bounds, while Mirage finished

with 13 points. Sharp-shooting 
guard Cindy Yamasaki sank I I of 
her 14 points in the first half, 
sending UCSD to the locker room 
with a 42-34 advantage. 

"We ran our offense success-
fully. We were making good 
passes and weren ' t throwing the 
ball away," Patsko said. 

Paterson tightened up on de-
fense and executed well offen-

sively in the second half, keeping 
the game close. UCSD made the 
necessary adjustments to squelch 
its opponents' last-minute surge. 
Senior guard Marcia Jefferies rose 

to the occasion, dishing off suc-
cessfully five times and finishing 
with 10 points. 

"If a team shuts somebody 
down, another player steps up," 
Patsko said. "We also fixed things 
on defense. We improve during 
the process of the game." 

UCSD's victory extends its 
record to 12-5 going into the last 
month of the regular season. The 
Tritons' shon reprieve ends to-
night when they travel to face 
crosstown ri val Point Lorna 
Nazarene. 

"Point Lorna is always a chal-
lenge, especially at their place," 
Patsko said. 

The combination of a winning 
record, high-intensity playing, a 
deep lineup and some recent im-
pressive performances have 
boosted UCSD's confidence. 

"We know we can playa solid 
team and beat them," Patsko said.

OT: Tritons fall to 
Panthers in overtime 
Continued from p •• 20 

Thimgan knocked down three of 
six allempted three-point baskets and 
finished with 16poinlS. Libby scored 
14 points and dished out six assists. 

Chapman clawed back into the 
game with a 14-4 run of its own, 
which pulled it to within three points 
of UCSD, at 63-60. 

The Tritons, who initially relied 
on perimeter shooling and a stining 
defense to counter the depth of the 
Panthers, started to show the effects 
of their intense effons. They were 
once again without the services of 
sophomore guards Jason Jones and 
Jason Barnes; and it shOWed, as fa-
tigue became a factor late in the 
second half. 

"Those guys definately give us a 
lift," senior guard David Dillon said. 
"Jones plays really good defense, 
and Bames can hit some shots. They 
are two guys who we really miss 
having in there." 

Regardless, the Tritons still led 
by four with 5:20 left. After a good 
defensive stop, Matt Minehan found 
Mike Ensley down low for an easy 
bucket to put UCSD ahead, 72-68. 

Chapman answered with a big 
three-point basket by freshman 
guard Mark Labelle. cutting the Tri -
ton lead to one. 

In the following two minutes, the 
teams .raded the lead on two-point 
field goals until sophomore guard 
Mark Sebek snatched a big defensive 
rebound and scored - following a 
Triton 20-sccond timeout - to put 
UCSD ahead, S()'" 77. 

Then, with 26 seconds left in 
regulation, Panther guard Derek 
Mitchell stepped up and launched a 
baseline three that found nothing 
but the bottom of the net to tie the 
game, 80-80. 

The Tritons went into an offen-
sive lull as they waited for the la t 
shot, but Libby's pass to Mike Wall 
coming off a baseline screen was 
read and picked offby Panther guard 
Umahl Anderson. 

"We were trying to set a screen 
for an open shot," Aune said. "It was 
just a miscommunication." 

Libby almost stole the ball back, 
as he knocked the ball out of 
Anderson's hands, but the ball 
squirted towards the sideline. Libby 
beat hi s man to the ball, but the 
official ruled that he had stepped on 
the sideline going for the save. This 
made it Panther ball with 2.6 sec-
onds left on the clock. 

Although Chapman couldn't 
convert in the waning seconds, it 
captured the precious commodity 
known as "momentum," as the teams 
regrouped for the extra five-minute 
stretch. 

"It was more psychological," 
freshman Joe Lewcock said of the 
momentum swing going into over-
time. "They got a big lift hitting that 
three at the end of regUlation." 

The Trilon defense was a step 
slow in OT, as Chapman worked the 
ball for easy baskets or drives to the 
hoop, often resulting in free throws. 

UCSD had a few opponunities, 
but Panther Head Coach Mike 
Bokosky realized that the Tritons 
were on the ropes and put in his 
freshest legs and best free-throw 
shooters. Chapman outscored 
UCSD, 13-6, in overtime. 

The Tritons hope to better their 
8-11 record u they kick off a long 
road swing starting today at Point 
Lorna Nazarene College. The next 
UCSD home ,ame is Feb. 24, when 
the Tritons host UC SIIIIa Cruz.

THE SHOW. 
Baseball players around the country 

dream of a having chance to make it there 
one day. To play on the perfectly groomed 
fields of Wrigley or Fenway. To hear the 
roar of the crowd and sec one's name in 
lights. It is a place where the likes of Ken 
Griffey Jr. and Roger Clemens rule the 
eanh. To make it, you have to be talented, 
lucky and, most of all, patient. 

Making it to the Major Leagues can take 
a long time, but Chris Miyake i not in a 
hurry. The future UCSD alumnus has been 
drafted by the Piltsburgh Pirates and will 
report to Spring Ball in Florida in two 
weeks. So what does he think ofthe chance 
10 someday play in the Major Leagues? 

"I don't want to waste the opportunity 
that I have been given," Miyake said. "I 
have my shot, and I want to take advantage 
of il." 

Miyake's story is of the little guy mak-
ing it big. Although he currently stands 6' 
3", he was never an imposing physical 
figure. He attended a small high school -
La Salle in Pasadena- which boasts a total 
of only 400 students. He was never a power 
hitter or a speedy runner. But he played 
good defense and he got a chance to break 
into the lineup. With the help of good 
coaches and hard work, he improved year 
after year and became an everyday player. 

" I went to a small high school,so I didn't 
get recruited," Miyake reflected. "I came 10 
UCSD mainly fortheeducation, but I heard 
about baseball tryouts and went out for the

team as a walk-on." 
Since then, Miyake has enjoyed a 

remarkable career at UCSD - as evi-
denced by his career statistics: a .366 
career balling average, 12 triples, 40 
doubles,I12RBlsand I 14 runs scored. 
His cinderalla story doesn't stop here, 
though. 

On June 6, 1995, Miyake was 
drafted in the 22nd round by 
the Pinsburgh Pirates, and 
became one of a select few 
Tritons ever to be drafted 
by a professional baseball 
team. 

'" remember that day 
because the scout who 
drafted me called my 
parents with the news, 
and my mom phoned 
me," Miyake said. " I 
was hoping that 1 
would get picked up, 
but when she called I 
was sort of shocked. 
It wasn't a total sur-
prise, but I was just 
stunned that it actu-
ally happened." 

Doug Takaragawa, 
the man who found 
Miyake's talents to be wor-
thy of the Pirates' organiza-
tion, was the same man who drafted 
Miyake's pitching coach several years back. 

"Wally [Miyake 's coach] told Doug to 
come check me out because he thought I 
could play, and the next thing I knew I was 
being drafted by a professional team," 
Miyake explained. 

Takaragawa saw something he liked in 
Miyake, and the Pirates seemed to agree. 

Miyake is set to leave for Florida in two 
weeks for an invite-only spring practice. 
He will work out for three weeks before 
spring training officially slans. But this 
won't be Chris' first experience as a pro 
player. Last summer, he played ball in Penn-

He Is Still 
Magic toMe 

He was my hero. 
When he stepped on a court, 

my heart went with him. It was 
his smile that endeared him to 
not only me, but to the 
hundreds of thousands like me 
who idolized him. 

It was a smile that, as they 
say, could light up a room. But 
his was an extraordinary one. 
If a good smile could light up 
your living room, his could 
cast a glow on every corner of 
the Metropolitan Opera House. 
h certainly brightened the 
press room after games. After 
all, the press room is small and 
his smile was big. 

So too was his presence on 
the court. He was a leader who 
was larger than life, and yet he 
blended into the now of a 
game like a chameleon 
becoming one with its environ-
ment. He worked beautifully 
with his teammates. They were 
poetry in motion. But, at 
crucial moments, with the 
pressure !>n and all eyes 
focused inten ely on his golden 
number 32 bobbing up the 
court, he would jump out and 
become a hero. 

He did what a hero should 
do. He made clutch shots. He 
smiled. He signed lots of 
autographs and smiled. He 
smiled as he won champion-
ship after championship and 
MVP after MVP. He was the 
heart of a city that followed his 
every endeavor, as if he was its 
king. And for many years, he 
lit up the town. And than, one 
day, it all came crashing down. 

The!",an with the golden 
smile retired. But he didn ' t 
retire as a man of his stature in 
the sport should, with a 
fareweJltour and uproarious 
fanfare (as was received the 
previolls year by his much-
heralded teammate). He retired 
suddenly and without warning. 
His game, his presence, his 
energy ... and his smile were 
taken from us, and I didn't 
know why. 

Then we found out... and I 
wished that I still didn't know 
why. I cried. He had made me 
smile so many times, but now 
he brought me to tears. 
Disbelief was the least of my 
rampant emotions. Denial and 
anger nooded me as well. Why 
had he been so stupid? This 
wasn't how a hero was 
supposed to act. He was 
supposed to be perfect, a model

Tiger's Attack Deadly to UCSD 
DOWN TO THE WIRE: 
The Tritons were unable 
to knock off Princeton 
in a thrilling five-setter 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

"This is the kind of match we need 
to learn how to win." 

Those were the words of UCSD 

points. 

Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik following 
his team's five-set de-
feat at the hands of 
Princeton on Tuesday 
night. The Tritons 
played a strong match 
at times, but failed to 
play well at crucial 

"I think this was pretty typical of 
the way our team is going to per-
form," Danneviksaid. "We do a lotof 
really good things, but at the time we 
need to step up big time, wejust don't 
have enough experience." 

Game one went to the visiting 
Tigers by a 15-11 tally, as the youthful 
UCSD starting squad was unable to 
gain the all-important first stanza. 

In the second game of the contest, 
the Tritons bounced back nicely ,jump-
ingout to an 8-3 advantage in the early 
going. Princeton closed to within 8-5 
before the momentum swung perma-
nently UCSD' s way on a great play by 
a trio ofTritons.

Panthers Scratch, Claw 
Past Tritons' in OT 
CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR: UCSD blew a thlrteen point lead 
in the fourth quarter eventually losing to Chapman in OT 
By Mike Stanee 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball team let an-
other opponent off the hook Tuesday night. 

With the Chapman Panthers struggling, 
trailing by 13 with only five minutes to 
play, the Tritons' offensive punch dis-
appeared. Once UCSD's scoring ma-
chine wasout-of-service, the Chapman 
squad came storming back to tie the 
game with only 26 seconds remaining. 
The Panthers then ran away with the 
game in overtime, winning 93-86. 

UCSD trailed the Panthers early, partly 
due to Chapman 's blistering 62-percent field-
goal percentage (in the first half) and partly 
due to a lack of Triton offensive movement. 

"We came out really sluggish," Aune said. 
"We-didn't turn it on until the last five 
minutes of the half." 

A 15-5 run, capped by sophomore 
forward Mike Ensley's rebound and 
basket, put UCSD up, 37-35, at the 
game's midway point. Ensley finished 
with II points on fi ve of eight shooting. 

UCSD's motion offense kicked into 

I to be admired and emulated. 

Center Malt Aune led UCSD in 
scoring and rebounding with 19 points and 12 
boards. The Tritons' attack relied heavily on 
the big guy in the game's early going. Aune is 
averaging double-double figures so far this 
season, racking up double- digits in both 
scoring and rebounding categories. 

gear as the game resumed. Forward 
Mike Thimgan and point guard Adam Libby 
led an early second-half charge which 
stretched the UCSD lead to 13 points, only 
after senior power forward Matt Minehan 
bombed a three with 13:20 remaining. 

But he wasn't. He was human. 
He had made mislakes. Too many
