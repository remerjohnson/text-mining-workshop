Regents Confirm Pradeep Khosla 
as UCSD’s Next Chancellor
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

UCSD’s new chancellor and a 
possible tuition increase topped the 
agenda for the Wednesday, May 16 
UC Board of Regents meeting in 
Sacramento. The meeting was the 
Regents’ last of the academic year.

The regents officially confirmed 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
Engineering Dean Pradeep Khosla 
as UCSD’s eighth Chancellor early 
in the meeting, which started with 
public input at 8:30 a.m.

Khosla, who officially takes over 
for current Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox on August 1, will receive an 
annual salary of $411,084. 

Like Fox, Khosla will receive uni-
versity-funded housing and a relo-
cation allowance of over $100,000 

over four years.
In a May 16 interview with 

UCSD News, Khosla said that he 
looks forward to working with stu-
dents to improve university life.

“I cannot imagine an education 
better than the one provided by 
UC San Diego, because of its great 
strengths in the arts and humanities, 
the sciences and medicine and engi-
neering and technology,” Khosla 
said.”

Khosla will visit UCSD’s campus 
on Thursday, May 17 to hold a press 
conference, viewable online at 11:45 
a.m.

The Regents held its meeting 
amidst talk of a controversial multi-
billion dollar state budget gap and 
the possibility of more tuition hikes 
for in-state students. The meeting 
was interrupted at one point by a 

group of around 15 student protest-
ers. According to the Los Angeles 
Times, the regents had to switch 
rooms to avoid disruption from the 
protesters.

Gov. Jerry Brown unveiled a new 
budget proposal on Monday, where 
he said that the state would have to 
make up a nearly $16 billion short-
fall for the 2012 fiscal year — seven 
billion more than had been antici-
pated in January.

The Associated Press reported in 
a May 9 story entitled, “University 
of California weighs more tuition 
hikes” that UC Regents is consider-
ing a 6 percent increase in tuition — 
roughly $731 per year — for 2012-
13 if the state legislature passes a 
$50 million cut to each the UC and 

This Friday’s Sun God Festival, featur-ing headliners alternative rock band Silversun Pickups and electronic dance music producer Paul Van Dyk, 
marks the event’s thirtieth anniversary.  

Planning for the annual event is a yearlong 
process. According to an email from Associate 
Vice President of Concerts and Events Oliver 
Zhang, ASCE started the booking process 
during Fall Quarter.

“We literally inquire about several hun-
dred artists, paying particular attention to 
those that are recommended by our students 
through a variety of methods,” Zhang said. 
“The booking process is very complex and 
artists may or may not work out because of 
numerous reasons, even though they may 
initially seem to be available or in our price 
range.”

Zhang said he is proud of the team’s final 
product and believes strongly in the quality of 
live performances with the lineup for this year.

“I truly stand by the claim that each act is 
going to absolutely blow your mind with their 
live performances and I really believe that 
this is one of the most diverse festival lineups 
we’ve had in the festival’s 30-year history,” 
Zhang said. 

Sun God guest tickets sold out on Tuesday, 
May 15. For the first time in the event’s his-
tory, guest tickets were available for purchase 
online starting April 23. This year, the 3,000 
guest tickets were available for $60 each, up 
from last year’s 3,000 tickets that sold at $50 
each. Last year, guest tickets sold out in three 
days.

Of the 20,0000 available tickets — the 
maximum capacity of RIMAC field — 17,000 
tickets are reserved for students. Student 
wristbands will be available at Marshall Field 
starting today from noon to 7 p.m. and Friday 
at 10 a.m. In 2011, student tickets sold out in 
six hours after going on sale.   

“Given the popularity of the festival in 

recent years, we expect that we’ll be able 
to distribute every festival wristband this 
year and for RIMAC Field to reach capacity,” 
Zhang said. 

The open dance area, which replaced the 
dance tent in 2011, will return this year to play 
host to electronic music acts like Tokimonsta 
and Tommy Trash. According to Zhang, the 
dance stage will be modified from last year’s 
set-up to accommodate for the surge in popu-
larity of electronic dance music. 

“We got rid of the Dance Tent in 2011 
because the popularity of electronic dance 
music exceeded the capacity of the dance tent 
structure that we had previously at the festi-
val,” Zhang said. “Not going to lie, it’s going to 
look really cool this year.”

The inflatable obstacle course and wreck-
ing ball will serve as additional attractions 
for students. ASCE will also create an interac-

Cal State systems.
In a YouTube address to 

Californians released May 12, 
Brown warned that more cuts to 
education may be imminent if vot-
ers do not approve his new tax ini-
tiative in November.

“We can’t fill a hole of this mag-
nitude with cuts alone without 
doing severe damage to our schools,” 
Brown said in the video. “That’s 
why I’m bypassing the gridlock and 
asking the people of California to 

approve a plan that avoids cuts to 
schools and public safety.” 

Brown’s tax plan would raise sales 
taxes by a quarter of 1 percent over 
the next four years. Additionally, 
“high-income earners” would pay 
up to 3 percent more in income 
taxes for seven years.

UC administrators have said ear-
lier this month that tuition may 
rise by a double digit percentage 
increase if the tax plan fails.

“We’re at a critical stage at the 
university. The Regents would face 
more draconian choices if the gov-

ernor’s initiative fails,” UC Vice 
President for Budget and Capital 
Resources, Patrick Lenz said in a 
May 9 interview with The Associated 
Press. “Short of an ability of the state 
to buy out a tuition increase, I’m not 
sure how we would avoid one.”

The regents will not vote on the 
proposed 6 percent tuition increase 
until its next meeting in July at 
earliest.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 17,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

The new A.S. council met for 
the first council meetings of their 
terms this week.

Former A.S. live blogger John 
Wang was elected to replace 
Courtney Hill as the council 
speaker.

Vice President 
of External 
Affairs Olamide 
Noah reported 
that the UCSA 
Congress has 
tentatively been 
scheduled for 
August 30 to September 2.

Associate Vice President 
of Student Advocacy Bryce 
Farrington informed the council 
that the changes to the student 
conduct code regarding police 
jurisdiction have been reverted 
back to their current position. 

Associate Vice President of 
Student Services Leigh Mason 
announced that A.S. Safe Rides 
would be changing its format next 
year from giving out three passes 
per quarter to a single sign-up 
system.

Arts and Humanities Senator 
Sean Estelle notified the council 
that the Public Education Coalition 
is organizing carpools up to a 
statewide student union organizing 
conference.

Arysha Sharifian was 
unanimously appointed as the 
executive director of the Student 
Organized Voter Accessed 
Committee. He told the council 
that currently, four of UCSD’s 
colleges are in a different precinct 
than the rest of the campus. In 
response, SOVAC is currently 
making an effort to help redraw 
precinct maps and provide each 
college with its own polling 
location.

Campus-wide Senator Brad 
Segal gave a presentation to 
the council on the possibility of 
creating an A.S. Human Rights 
Board. His hope is for A.S. Council 
to create an avenue for students 

and organizations 
that engage in 
social issues 
and advocacy 
of global justice 
to collaborate 
together. He 
added that he was 
inspired by UCSB 

and the annual Human Rights 
Week that they hold, and wants for 
UCSD to be able to do something 
similar.

Associate Vice President 
of Academics Samuel Chang 
expressed that he would like A.S. 
to allocate more funding for the 
Academic Affairs office in the 
future. 

These student funds would be 
used to continue to grant student 
funds, educate the student body 
and provide a bridge for students 
and professors.

“Academic affairs has a lot of 
potential and I think that this 
council should continue to let it 
grow,” Chang said.

Council passed its first piece of 
legislation unanimously, changing 
the bylaws to specify that the 
vice president of external affairs 
position would chair the Legislative 
Committee.

Senators were randomly selected 
in front of the council for the 
associate vice president selection 
committees. This was done to 
ensure transparency of the entire 
process. 

The selection continues next 
week with meetings and interviews 
for the candidates.

A student observes the wall erected for MSA’s Justice in Palestine Week.

Student groups called for 
Justice in Palestine and Israel 
Solidarity through a series of 
weeklong demonstrations on 
Library Walk. 

The Muslim Student 
Association’s Justice in 
Palestine event featured a 
multi-paneled wall that is 
meant to simulate the walls 
separating Israel from the 
West Bank and Gaza. 

Tritons for Israel organized 
the Israel Solidarity Week 
event, which featured display 
panels on Library Walk to 
address MSA’s claims of 
Israel as an “apartheid” state. 

Both events had scheduled 
speakers throughout the week 
to discuss the controversial 
issue and its implications in 
the twenty-first century.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 17,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

BY OLIVER ZHANG
Associate Vice President
ASUCSD Concerts & Events

Another year, another Sun 
God! For us at A.S. Concerts & 
Events, it’s been a challenging but 
extremely rewarding process just 
to get to this point. Needless to say, 
we’re very excited for tomorrow 
and can’t wait to see you all on 
RIMAC Field.

I wanted to use this space first 
and foremost to address some 
safety concerns:

A zero-tolerance policy will be 
in effect and all UCSD Police, RAs, 
RSOs and resident deans are strictly 
enforcing all policies and laws. 

 Free water will be available for 
all attendees who bring a non-glass, 
reusable, empty water bottle to the 
festival. Stay hydrated!

Any visibly intoxicated person 
will be denied entrance to the event 

and may be detained by the police.
Please be respectful of 

neighboring residents and 
university staff, especially around 
the Marshall Field Box Office on 
Thursday and Friday.

Your cooperation in following 
all UCSD policies and remaining in 
control of your use of alcohol will 
minimize many potential problems 
during the event.

We know that the mood is 
pretty festive during Sun God 
(I was right there with you all 
in 2010 — danced my glasses 
off during Designer Drugs and 
proceeded to squint through 
Drake’s performance), but I want to 
encourage you all to party safely. 

Check the festival website 
(http://sgf.ucsd.edu/safety) for 
more useful information. The back 
cover of the festival guide this year 
will also include some safety tips 
and space to list an emergency 

contact.
It takes a village to plan a Sun 

God, and this year is no exception. 
The ASCE staff and interns have 
been putting countless hours into 
this event since early Fall Quarter, 
and I’m incredibly proud of what 
we have accomplished. We’ve had 
to work through a number of 
difficult obstacles this year, and 
that we were able to overcome 
them has been an incredible growth 
experience. I’m not writing this 
column because we’re stoked on 
ourselves and want to pat ourselves 
on the back, but because I’m truly 
grateful for those involved in 
the planning process and for the 
opportunity to work on this festival 
itself. 

Sun God has been a campus 
tradition ever since 1983. Since 
then, it’s changed venues and 
formats numerous times, and 
continues to grow bigger and better 

each and every year. Events of this 
magnitude and scale at universities 
almost never last this long, so it’s 
a testament to the students and 
university community that we’re 
able to continue producing this 
festival every year (and are in good 
shape to keep going for another 30 
years).

The Sun God Festival is 
arguably the biggest college music 
and arts festival in the country. 
It’s something that I’m incredibly 
proud to be a part of, and 
incredibly grateful for as a UCSD 
student. 

When you’re on the field 
tomorrow, take some time to take 
it all in and appreciate how special 
and unique the festival really is. It’s 
something I’m planning on doing 
throughout the day.

Have fun out there, and be sure 
to take care of yourselves and each 
other.

Students Should Stay Safe to Keep Sun God Tradition Alive
GUEST COMMENTARY

In light of his recent support for gay marriage, President Barack Obama has been called 
a flip-flopper, an evolver, a hesitator. 
Newsweek is honoring Obama’s 
statements on its cover, featuring 

a dramatic picture of the president 
with a rainbow halo around his 
head and the statement “Our First 
Gay President.” And because of the 
historical nature of Obama’s decision 
to (finally) back gay marriage, 
political pundits from both the right 
and left are stepping up on their 
soapboxes to shine a light on Obama’s 
decision. Seasoned political reporters 
from the New York Times to the 
Washington Post to the Christian 
Science Monitor have all weighed in 
— and so has Bristol Palin.

Some may remember Bristol Palin 
from her momma’s disastrous first 
stint with big girl politics, when she 
single-handedly helped John McCain 
lose the 2008 election. Others may 
remember her through Levi Johnston, 
her baby daddy who, despite 
impregnating Palin and tattooing her 
name on his ring finger, ditched her 
to become a model and an actor in 
Hollywood. 

In any case, Palin responded to 
Obama’s decision to change his stance 
of same sex marriage on the religious 
blog Patheos.com, stating that in 
general, children grow up better in a 
household with both a mother and a 
father. Of course, the first response 
to this frankly narrow-minded 
statement is that Bristol Palin is a 
gigantic hypocrite. A single mother at 
17, abandoned by her douchey baby 
daddy — what gives her the right 
to open her big Alaskan mouth and 
say these things? And people, from 
the thousands of comments that her 
blog post has already garnered, to 
JWOWW, the perennially orange one 
from the cast of Jersey Shore, have all 
responded in kind. 

But the thing is, Palin has 
responded to these comments about 
her hypocrisy. 

And dare I say it — she makes a 
good point:

 “I find it strange that the culture 
rightfully applauds former drug 
addicts who warn children of the 
dangers of drug use. They are happy 
to listen to former alcoholics talk 
about how they finally are living a 
clean life. But when it comes to me 
talking about waiting until marriage 
for sex, it’s almost like people want 
me to slink away in shame…unable 
to show my face in public again 
because of my past mistakes.”

I may not agree with Palin’s 
view on mixed-sex marriage or her 
mother’s views on, well, anything. 
But she’s right — blindly attacking 
Palin for being a hypocrite is like 
criticizing a smoker turned lung 
cancer patient for talking about the 
dangers of smoking. Perhaps we were 
the hypocrites after all.

That being said, Obama’s support 
of gay marriage, though a bit late 
and could only have happened with 
Biden’s prior statements, was a huge 
and historic event. I support it.

A Different Course

Over the last few years, fears have run rampant over the number of college students graduating in five 
years or more. University of California 
undergraduate graduation rates hit their 
all time low in the mid-’90s, with nearly 
40 percent of college graduates across UC 
campuses taking more than four years to 
graduate. 

It was no wonder that university 
officials have enlisted an effort to shuffle 
over 150,000 undergraduates through 
dozens of different disciplines in as little 
time as possible. And in doing so, the 
most recent data circa 2004 has shown 
a decrease in five-plus year graduates, 
now hovering around 23 percent. Clearly, 
changes still need to be made.

The UCSD Communications 
Department made such a change this 
past spring, effective Fall Quarter 2012. 
By cutting its major requirements from 
15 classes to 13 classes, and generalizing 

the way the courses are labeled, the major 
now can effectively be finished in less than 
three years, with minimal prerequisites. 
Before, the major followed three major 
paths that each student had to complete to 
finish the major. 

For instance, to take a class labeled 
COCU 177, one had to take the lower 
division introductory course COCU 100, 
which of course had an overcrowded 
waitlist. By eliminating the unnecessary 
constraints of the COCU, COHI and 
COSF sequences, the Communications 
Department effectively opened up its 
major like its more enrollment-friendly 
peer, political science. Even though 
political science majors can choose any 
number of specialties, they essentially 
have free reign over which classes they 
wish to take out of the 15 to 20 offered in 
a quarter. 

But while these dramatic major changes 
are a step in the right direction in pushing 

EDITORIAL

While cutting communications major requirements is a step in the right direction 
in helping students graduate on time, the changes should have focused on adding 

more practical coursework.

Dear Editor,
Occupations are illegal, immoral 

and violent and I’m with Students for 
Justice in Palestine as they recognize 
that and organize against it.

As poet Remi Kanazi said on 
Tuesday’s SJP event, “We’re told to be 
‘moderate,’ but that’s a code word for 
‘Don’t defend your rights.’ Everyone 
should be against occupation, 
everyone should be against war 
crimes.”

J Street, Tritons for Israel, and the 
other “peace/democracy-washing” 
organizations use these terms to 
ignore gross war crimes (UN, 
documented cluster bombs, white 
phosphorus, collective punishment 
[banned after the Nuremberg trials], 
to name a few), human rights 
violations and systemic threats to 
peace and democracy in the region 
such as refusing to grant citizenship 
to occupied peoples.

These organizations fail to 
recognize that Israel is in fact the 
aggressor (which is the definition of 
an occupation: There’s an occupier 
and an occupied).

The occupied, Palestine, is 
protected under international law to 
protect itself.  This isn’t a “conflict” 
as these “peace-washing” groups 
call it, but Palestinian self-defense 
against violent occupation which 
receives funding, arms and training 
from the other imperialist military 
in the Middle East: the U.S.

These groups love to say: “it’s 
more complex” or “Let’s talk for 
seven hours ’til you agree it’s 
complex.” I base this off the many, 
many, many times this happened 
during my undergraduate years, 
but lesson learned: These groups 
— maybe some of the individuals 

are not but their leadership and the 
nature of these groups themselves  
— definitely are not interested in 
a one-state solution that provides 
dignity and human rights for all, 
but are only interested in a solution 
that divides Israelis and Palestinians, 
which under current borders would 
mean Israel would have access to all 
major roadways, water sources and 
the best farming land.

J Street and these “peace-
washing” organizations fail to 
condemn the many Palestine or 
Lebanon massacres, and fail to 
support the hunger strikers and 
Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions 
movement among a host of 
other nonviolent Palestinian-led 
campaigns.

These and many, many more 
reasons are why I cannot morally 
or politically go to any J Street or 
Tritons for Israel or any “peace-
washing” organization’s events, and 
why I encourage others not to as 
well. Plus I have never seen any of 
these organizations ever actually 
organize or build a movement to end 
the occupation. They remind me of 
the adage about “talk shop” campus 
groups: ‘They organize people to 
have events, instead of having events 
to organize people.’

Also, if any group wants to 
promote dialogue, please have your 
event/tabling not during the main 
event week of the group you want 
to have dialogue with. It’s almost 
like it’s competing which is a shame 
because there are 9 other weeks to 
present these views that aren’t during 
Justice in Palestine (this week!), 
whose views on the Apartheid differ 
from J Street and the other “peace-
washing” groups.

Introducing his “This Poem 
will not End Apartheid,” Remi said, 
“Those organizing for Palestinian 
liberation always have two things 
on their side: history and truth. 

Palestinians are not helpless people 
in need of aid, but occupied people 
fighting for freedom. Inaction isn’t 
an option.”

Dear Editor,
Here’s a simple suggestion that 

could solve California’s �nancial de�cit 
problem: If California would impose 
a tax of 1 cent per gallon of water, 
and/or at least $1 per gallon of gas, 
the California de�cit would quickly 
be eliminated. It might also cause 
Californians (and following the same 
approach in other states, Americans 
in general) to be less wasteful of water 
and energy.  It would help address 
the crucial issues of water shortage 
and climate change, particularly since 
pumping water uses 40 percent of 
the entire California state electricity 
supply.  All countries in Europe charge 
over $4 tax per gallon of gas, covering 
their social needs.  Rich America 
could similarly provide for its citizens. 
It is a path to responsibility.  What do 
you think?

Peace-Washing Orgs Fail 
to Condemn Massacres

students towards graduating on 
time, these easier requirements 
only highlight the fact that if 
communications wasn’t notoriously 
the easiest major before, it certainly 
is now. 

However, this shortened major 
(that allows Ds as passing grades, 
no less), certainly will push 
students who want to stay their 
full four years to take up a second 
major or at the very least, a minor. 

Another significant shift in 
this major change is the fact that 
it highlights just how theoretical 
communications is. When the 
program was founded in the 1970s 
with the development of Thurgood 
Marshall College, the department 
took on a more theoretical 
approach to communication studies 
instead of going a more practical 
route. 

According to Communications 
Professor Patrick Anderson, the 
Communications Department was 
created to train communication 
theorists in critical thought.  This 
is certainly reflective now, with 
such class requirements as “Situated 
Practices,” “Interpretive Strategies” 
and “Social Formations.” With such 
theoretical courses and a great deal 
of intellectual repetition (Stuart 
Hall, for one), many of the courses 
start to seem almost expendable.  

While this approach has 
made UCSD’s Communications 
Department, according to 
Anderson, one of the most cutting 
edge departments in the nation, 
we posit that the major could 
benefit from more practical course 
offerings. Currently, the curriculum 
offers classes that balance practical 
knowledge with theory — media 
offerings in the context of political 
science, journalism in the context 

of sociology. 
And though these offerings are 

certainly helpful in a theoretical 
standpoint, the fact of the matter 
remains that most communications 
students plan to graduate and enter 
the workforce, and to do so, need 
to learn practical skills. 

In fact, the Communications 
Department already offers classes 
under the title, Communications 
and Media Methods, which 
offer practical skills such as 
“non-linear digital editing” and 
“Digital Journalism.” Now that 
the mandatory COHI, COCU 
and COSF sequences have been 
eliminated from the major, it 
incentivizes taking these media 
classes that were once considered 
“electives.”

In the case of UCSB, 
communications coursework takes 
a dive into the practical, with 
courses like “Interviewing theory 
and practice” while keeping the 
study theoretical with courses 
called “Persuasion.” 

One positive outcome of 
this shift is the requirement of 
junior seminars in the major. 
Though of course, these seminars 
stay firmly rooted in the realm 
of the theoretical, it allows 
communications students an 
opportunity to take classes taught 
by their favorite professors and 
develop a rapport, crucial to getting 
letters of recommendation post-
graduation. 

In short, while the 
communication major changes 
are certainly a step in the right 
direction in reducing the number 
of five-plus-year graduates at 
UCSD, a greater focus on the 
value of coursework (theoretical or 
otherwise) will ensure the value of 
a communications major.

“In our efforts to improve the 
[Sun God] festival look and feel 
this year, we’re bringing more per-
formance-based acts to the festival 
such as Cirque Berzerk and the 
Burning Man-esque Billion Jelly

A.S. Council is collaborating 
with ASCE to raise grants to sup-

of a special tank top, raffle entry 
or donations at the festival and its 
related events throughout the week. 

As part of Sun God Week, 
University Centers presented a 
free concert at Price Center Plaza 
on Monday featuring San Diego 
indie-rock band Delta Spirit. KSDT 
hosted its first show at the Loft 
featuring Craft Spells Wednesday 
night as part of the weeklong cel-

with Thursday’s fifth annual Up

showcases student films selected by 
a panel of industry professionals. 

According to University Centers 
Campus Events Manager Alex 
Kushner in an email, ASCE is work-
ing with Student Health Services on 
the “Don’t Miss the Music” cam-
paign, which encourages students 
to make safe choices during the 
festival.

“The health and safety of our 
students is our highest priority in 
planning this event and we make 
great efforts to ensure that this is 
reflected not only in the way pro-

FEATURING

Silversun 
Pickups
T hose pining for a resurrection of the Smashing Pumpkins’ sappy and soaring ‘90s alt-rock found it in the Silversun 
Pickups’ 2006 debut, LP Carnavas. Driving single 
“Lazy Eye” was as unabashedly angsty and explo-
sive as anything off Siamese Dream, lead man 
Brian Aubert’s whisper-yell delivery sounded 
uncannily like Billy Corgan’s and, not to mention, 
the bands conveniently shared the same initials. 

But six years and two more LPs later, the 
Pickups are likely sick of the Smashing Pumpkins 
comparisons — particularly because they riddle 
each and every article, album review and press 
release about the band since their inception in 
2005. 

Their latest album, this month’s Neck of the 
Woods, certainly reflects the urge to embrace an 
updated sound. Allegedly inspired by the band’s 
love for horror films, the album is full of clean 
and brooding synth rock songs with eerie names 
(“Skin Graph,” “Bloody Mary,” “Mean Spirits,” to 
name a few) that sound less like shoegazey hom-
age and more like Jimmy Eat World. 

With the help of Bloc Party and Snow Patrol 
producer Jacknife Lee, Neck of the Woods has 
more production sheen than any of the Pickups’ 
previous studio releases — while keeping drum-
mer Chris Guanlao’s motorik grooves and Aubert’s 
distinctive vocal intimacy intact. The album has 
already gained critical attention, receiving praise 
from Paste, The A.V. Club and Alternative Press.

If last year’s parade of blunt-happy hip-hop 
headliners wasn’t your cup of tea, prepare to 
headbang the final hour of Sun God away to some 
triumphant, occasionally nostalgic jams.

HIATUS EDITOR

Paul van Dyk
H e may be the old guy at this year’s Sun God Festival, but Paul van Dyk hasn’t seen many shortcomings to his dancefloor formula since he 
started mixing in Berlin way back  in 1988.

Admittedly, it’s hard to ignore the fact that times 
have changed since van Dyk first learned the ropes two 
decades ago. Though he reached international fame as a 
globe-trotting DJ and remixer in the mid-1990s — mak-
ing van Dyk a legend in the electronic dance music scene 
— youngsters like Skrillex and Deadmau5 continue to hog 
the spotlight today. 

So this Sun God, don’t expect their kind of party; 
nah, expect a ‘90s revival with van Dyk bumping the 
kind of ethereal trance that made EDM a phenomenon, 
soundtracking the raves Dateline first worried would 
destroy a generation of adolescent pacifier-suckers — 
Electric Daisy Carnival be damned. 

Paul van Dyk may be older, and RIMAC may not be 
an abandoned warehouse, but the smooth, stylish grooves 
of his debut single and mega-hit “For An Angel” might 

just bring us back to 1994. Not that van Dyk only has nos-
talgia to offer. The DJ-producer has been quietly chugging 
along as the second wave of EDM flourishes, releasing his 
sixth studio album Evolution this past April. 

According to van Dyk, the album’s title reflects the 
diversity of the music. 

“For me, electronic music is not about just house 
music or electro or trance or dubstep or techno — it’s 
about electronic music all together,” he said in an inter-
view with The Vancouver Sun. “This is obviously what this 
album reflects real well because you find elements from all 
of those sub-genres on that album put together in a differ-
ent way.” 

Still, trance will be the name of the game. New tracks 
like “Verano” and “Rock This” mesh rustling, synthesized 
beats with catchy vocal hooks — the obvious makings of 
one raucous Sun God.

Chiddy 
Bang

F ew can deliver infectious alternative hip hop quite like Chiddy Bang, aka rap-
per Chidera “Chiddy” Anamege 
and DJ/producer Noah “Xaphoon” 
Jones Beresin. After meeting at uni-
versity back in 2008, the duo quick-
ly achieved underground fame on 
the back of a collection of mixtapes 
on which they refined their unique 
style, consisting of playful rap 
delivered over a mixture of electro 
loops and indie rhythms. 

Xaphoon and Chiddy, who cur-
rently holds the Guinness World 
Record for the “Longest Freestyle 
Rap” (9 hours, 16 minutes, and 22 
seconds), have made rapid progress 
since the release of The Preview 
in 2010 — an EP memorable for 
some catchy reworkings indie-
minded artists like Passion Pit 
and Sufjan Stevens. The mixtape’s 
most popular single “Opposite of 
Adults” — featuring an instantly 
recognisable sample of MGMT’s 

“Kids” — promises to be one of the 
most memorable highlights of this 
year’s festival.

Chiddy Bang will arrive for their 
Sun God appearance almost half 
way through the most important 
year of their career. February saw 
the release of their first full-length 
record Breakfast, which see the duo 
continuing the accessible rhymes 
and genre-crossing beats of their 
earlier work. The group’s perfor-
mance at RIMAC on Friday will be 
just one of many throughout a hec-
tic summer of touring, which will 
include festivals across the United 
States and Europe and an enticing 
set of shows with Wiz Khalifa and 
Kendrick Lamar in August. Sun 
God offers an ideal opportunity 
for this notoriously energetic and 
interactive live act to justify their 
escalating reputation.

Ra Ra Riot

D espite their sunny, indie-pop disposition, the members of Ra Ra Riot are no strangers 
to adversity. With the tragic loss of 
founding drummer John Ryan Pike 
in 2007 (inspiration for the band’s 
poignant 2008 release The Rhumb 
Line), and the departure of cellist 
Alexandra Lawn earlier this year, the 
band has had a rocky — albeit criti-
cally celebrated — career. 

Yet they show no signs of slowing.  
Ra Ra Riot consists of vocalist 

Wes Miles, bassist Mathieu Santos, 
guitarist Milo Bonacci and violin-
ist Rebecca Zeller — all of whom 
met during their time at and around 
Syracuse University in New York. 
Though they graduated six years 
ago, the band’s college spirit remains 
intact. 

“The band is really excited to 
play at Sun God,” Violinist Rebecca 
Zeller told the Guardian. “We expect 
students to be somewhat intoxicated 

and enjoying themselves.” 
The band is known for its punchy 

and organic rock grooves reminis-
cent of Vampire Weekend, supported 
by sweeping orchestral cello and 
violin arrangements in the vein of 
Arcade Fire.

“I always saw myself playing vio-
lin as I got older, but never in a rock 
band,” Zeller said.

This transition from mod-
est indie club rock to epic festival 
anthems was particularly evident on 
2010’s The Orchard, whose trium-
phant title track opener fed into the 
breathlessly exuberant lead single 
“Boy.”

Currently, the band is back to 
work, writing and recording for an 
as-of-yet undisclosed project.

“We just got out of the studio, 
and there is a possibility of some new 
material,” Zeller said. “It’s not a guar-
antee but a possibility.”

INTERVIEW

Macklemore & 
Ryan Lewis

F or the last decade or so, Macklemore, aka rapper Ben Haggerty, has been releasing 
the kind of reflective rap music that 
makes semi-educated social com-
mentary listenable. His tracks touch 
on topics as diverse as the prevailing 
acceptance of cough syrup abuse in 
the rap industry on “Otherside” (fea-
turing a great Red Hot Chili Peppers 
sample of the same name) to the 
negative effects of consumerism in 
“Wings,” an ode to avid sneakerheads 
everywhere. 

Despite addressing these issues, 
Macklemore makes a conscious effort 
to avoid preaching in his songs.

“I’m not trying to tell people how 
to live their lives,” Haggerty told the 
Guardian. “A lot of the time, I’m talk-
ing to myself on these songs, dealing 
with issues that I have.” 

One such issue, the staunch anti-
consumerism Haggerty advocates 
on the aforementioned “Wings,” 
admittedly presents a challenge for 
the Seattle-bred underground rapper-
turned frat party sensation. 

“Right now I’m sitting in a Cadillac 
wearing Jordans,” Haggerty said. 

Macklemore’s music is refreshing 
in its Yeezy-esque mix of honesty and 
self-contradiction. But that’s not to 
say that Macklemore can be relegated 
to the ranks of “conscious” rappers 
that insist on social statements at the 
expense of making fresh, listenable 
pop music. 

Much of Macklemore’s work is 
made with producer Ryan Lewis, who 
will be accompanying Haggerty at 
Sun God. The two mix traditional rap 
production with violins, pianos and 
trumpets, creating a full sound that 
blends well with Haggerty’s passionate 
flow. Both Haggerty and Lewis hail 
from Seattle, and Macklemore credits 

the city’s diverse musical history — he 
cited Quincy Jones and Nirvana as 
influences — with giving his music a 
distinctive sound. Though Haggerty 
asserts that “there’s a fine line between 
emulating and biting,” he said he’s 
currently inspired by Kendrick Lamar 
and Schoolboy Q, as well as Kanye 
West.

If this range of musical influences 
seems incredibly broad, it’s by design. 
Macklemore says that his next studio 
album, slated for release in the fall, 
will be “a mixture of lots of differ-
ent sounds.” This conscious aim for 
diversity is true of Macklemore’s per-
formances, too. 

“Expect a range of emotions, 
lots of high energy, and an engaging 
show,” Haggerty said. “It’ll be hella 
fun.”

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 17,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 9

Tokimonsta
W ith her subtle blend of playful, unassuming melodies and bass-heavy 
hip hop beats, Tokimonsta has 
quickly risen to the upper ranks 
of Los Angeles’ fertile electronic 
music scene. Currently signed to 
Flying Lotus’ influential Brainfeeder 
Records, Toki has spent the last sev-
eral years steadily releasing music, 
most notably on her debut album 
Midnight Menu for Japanese record 
label Art Union. Her style, while 
firmly rooted in LA hip hop culture, 
possesses a sense of melodicism 
uncommon to artists of that genre 
— a fact that should come as no 
surprise — given her background in 
classical piano. 

According to Jennifer Lee, the 
woman behind the stage name, she 

began listening to hip-hop as a way 
of differentiating herself from her 
punk-listening upper-middle class 
peers while growing up in Torrance, 
Calif.  

Recently, Tokimonsta (“toki” is 
Korean for rabbit, while “monsta” 
should require no explanation) 
released Creature Dreams, an excel-
lent EP of smooth, down-tempo 
songs often featuring, for the first 
time, the artist’s vocals. Don’t let that 
record’s nocturnal hip-hop lullabies 
fool you, though: when she DJs, Toki 
goes hard. Her DJ sets often combine 
her own gently psychedelic produc-
tions with heavy hip-hop tracks of 
all kinds.

L ike yesteryear’s Michelle Branch and Sara Bareilles, Dia Frampton’s Sun God per-
formance will provide the allotted 
bubbly acoustic female set sched-
uled to give your addled brain cells 
some happy afternoon downtime.

Beginning her career with older 
sister Meg under the Meg & Dia 
moniker, Frampton self-promoted 
her band via MySpace (back in 
2005, when it still made a differ-
ence), landing the duo on the 2006 
Vans Warped Tour lineup. Meg & 
Dia released two full-length albums 
in 2007 and 2009, and were even-
tually dropped from their Warner 
Bros. label in 2010.

Last year, however, Dia audi-
tioned for the TV singing competi-
tion “The Voice” and ended up the 

first season’s runner up, under the 
wing of coach Blake Shelton. And 
though Meg & Dia now perform 
under the name Dia Frampton, 
Meg still supports her sister on the 
back-up guitar on stage. Frampton 
released her anticipated solo debut, 
Red, last December.

Self-described as “indie folk-
pop with a lemony twist,” Dia 
Frampton’s pretty pop melodies 
are sure to go down as smooth and 
sweet as the setting sun. With an 
early evening set, Dia Frampton’s 
doe-y eyes and bubblegum voice 
will be a pleasant precursor to the 
messy debauchery that the night 
will bring.

Dia Frampton

Clockwork
G aining online fame with his homespun remixes and dance music at just 18 years 
old, Los Angeles’ Clockwork is a true 
product of the digital age. 

Clockwork’s career took off when 
DJ kingpin Steve Aoki caught wind 
of “Squad Up,” an original Clockwork 
track that was circulating in the elec-
tronic music blogosphere, and signed 
him to the prolific Dim Mak roster. 

Since then, Clockwork has kept 
busy with both official and bootleg 
remixes of electronic work from 

Aoki and Avicii to Dimitri Vegas. 
His sound is self-described as hav-
ing a “bass-heavy, big room sound,” 
reminiscent of DJ Tiesto and Steve 
Angello. More recently, Clockwork 
has made himself a festival staple, 
with a well-received performance slot 
at Hard Haunted Mansion Festival 
2011. Clockwork’s Squad UP EP is 
set for release this year on Dim Mak 
records.

Oliver
O liver is, in actuality, two Olivers: Vancouver’s Vaughn Oliver (aka U-Tern) and San 
Fernando Valley’s Oliver Goldstein 
(aka Oligee) — the former, a pro-
ducer at the forefront of modern 
electronic music’s recent surge of 
disco revival, and the latter, a beat-
maker and self-proclaimed “overlord 
of third millenium romantifunk.”

Together, the duo has turned 
heads in the club world with their 

cleanly produced nu-disco gems 
seated proudly in the shadow of Daft 
Punk. With an arsenal of warbling 
synths and vocoder riffs, Oliver 
has remixed the likes of Foster the 
People, Childish Gambino and 
Chromeo, in addition to their own 
original dance tracks fit for any 
proper boogie night.

Tommy 
Trash

A recent press release claims that L.A.-via-Australia DJ Tommy Trash is “rescu-
ing the world from dance music 
apocalypse.” While this is unlikely, 
Tommy Trash is an excellent elec-
tro-house DJ who is certainly no 
stranger to the world of electronic 
music. 

From remixing artists like 
Kaskade and Armand Van Helden 
to mixing two volumes of Ministry 
of Sound’s reputable Electro 
House Sessions, Tommy Trash 
has stayed busy in recent years, at 
one point simultaneously hold-
ing the #1 and #2 positions on the 
Aria (the Australian equivalent 
of the Billboard Charts) Club 
Chart. 

Tommy’s quickly growing 
stature in the American house 
music scene (he’s recently put out 
records on labels like Dim Mak and 
Deadmau5’ aptly named Mau5trap 
Records) is likely due to his hard-
partying, big-room-ready sound, 
which he promises to bring to Sun 
God Festival’s Dance Stage in great 
quantities. On his current tour, 
Tommy Trash will be playing sets 
comprised almost entirely of his 
own music, which should ensure 
a riotous electro-house experience 
that’ll doubtless leave you ready 
for Dance Stage headliner Paul Van 
Dyk.

Alier and 
the Band
H aving already secured a dedicated following open-ing for notable acts such as 
Devin the Dude, the Cataracts, the 
Game, People Under the Stairs and 
the upcoming Freddie Gibbs show 
at the Loft this May 8, UCSD Battle 
of the Bands winner Alier Johnson 
is hardly new to San Diego’s hip-hop 
scene. And, with his refreshing, reviv-
alist approach to purely analog live 
rap, it’s little wonder how Alier and 
“the Band” (guitarist Andrew Ramos, 
drummer Kyle Venezuela and bassist 
Nina Dumas) have gained the atten-

tion.
Johnson’s flow is fine-tuned and 

consistent with a lyrical approach 
more akin to the recent trend of 
everyman rap a la Curren$y and 
Kendrick Lamar’s Black Hippy crew, 
than to the gangsta rappers of decades 
past. With the solid soul/rock grooves 
of his skilled accompanying band 
behind him, the result is some infec-
tious hip-hop that will start Sun God 
off with a seriously smooth pre-party.

UCSD STUDENT CONDUCT
CODE ISSUES:

    
    The Student Conduct Code can apply to 
off-campus activities hosted by student
organizations.
 
    The University can impose discipline if it finds 
evidence of “physical assault, or threats of 
violence, or conduct that threatens the health or 
safety of any person, including ones self.

    The University can also impose sanctions if you 
fail to identify yourself or fail to comply with a 
University official or police officer acting in the 
performance of his or her duties.

STUDENT CONDUCT DISCIPLINARY 
PROCESS: YOUR OPTIONS

    If you are charged, you will receive a notice 
from an administrator indicating
which policies you have violated.

    Contact the Office of Student Advocacy for 
answers to questions and preparation for 
meetings and reviews.

    You do not have to accept the sanctions 
presented by your dean. You have a right to go 
forward with a review hearing to determine if you 
committed the violation.

    You also have the right to appeal the decision of 
your review hearing.

    If you are charged with a Student Conduct Code 
violation you may also be facing criminal charges.

The Student Conduct Code Revision Workgroup 
thanks UC San Diego faculty, sta� and student 
leaders for their interest and their feedback.  
Since May 2009, the Workgroup has served 
in partnership with individuals and groups to 
develop a new Code for UC San Diego.

The Workgroup has reached out to the 
UC San Diego Community through nearly 30 

consultations about the new Code, and feedback 
has been incorporated through a continuous 
revision process.  

In addition to active participation among the 
students, sta�, and faculty serving on the Work-
group, the new Code has been benchmarked 
with peer institutions and vetted through the 
UC O�ce of the President.

Conduct Code, its history, and the members of 
the UC San Diego Community who collaborated 
to develop it. Visit RevisedCode.ucsd.edu.

What the Kutztown? NCAA Division II 
Athletics: An Introduction to Small Colleges
sities. But it’s something that’s hard 
to neglect in the realm of Division 
II so�ball, where big name univer-
sities take a backseat and where the 
landscape of creatively named, small 
higher education institutions moves 
to the forefront.

�is weekend, the UCSD So�ball 
team will compete in the Division 
II College World Series. �e eight-
team tournament will feature the 
likes of Kutztown University, Au-
gustana, Valdosta State, Southern 
Connecticut State, Central Oklaho-
ma, Flagler and St. Joe (unabbrevi-
ated) College. 

Don’t worry, I’ve never heard of 
any of them either.

In my time covering Division II 
athletics, I have become acclimated 
to the array of “colorful” small insti-
tution monikers. 

Last year, I was unfazed when 
our so�ball team traveled up to 
Rochester, N.Y. — to the campus of 

C.W. Post College — to compete in 
the College World Series. 

Last year’s sports editor realized 
that C.W. Post College was named 
for Charles William Post, founder 
of Post Cereal, manufacturers of 
beloved breakfast foods: Fruity Peb-
bles, Honey Bunches of Oats as well 
as the not-so-beloved cereal, Raisin 
Bran.

It was then that I started to not 
only take notice of the best of Divi-
sion II Athletics, but also the best 
names in Division II Athletics.

Kutztown, appearing in the na-
tional tournament in both so�ball 
and baseball, is named for its loca-
tion in rural Pennsylvania. Unfor-
tunately, “Kutztown” for me at least, 
conjures up images of Wiz Khalifa’s 
2010 single, “In the Cut,” where 
Khalifa details his night, “in the cut, 
rolling doobies up.”

In the same vein (drugs) — pun 
intended — there’s North Carolina’s 
“Coker College,” regrettably named 

for Civil War veteran Major James 
Lide Coker. 

Also participating in the 2012 
national tournament is Pennsylva-
nia’s Seton Hill. 

�e only thing funny about the 
respected Catholic institution is that 
they sound like a more a�ordable 
knock-o� of Seton Hall — the “Rice 
Crisps” to Seton Hall’s Rice Krispies.

Other notable Division II schools 
in Pennsylvania, evidently a gold-
mine for eccentrically named higher 
education institutions, include: Slip-
pery Rock, Shippensburg and Mercy 
Hurst.

�e list also includes a myriad 
of establishments simply given �rst 
names: Lynn, Mary, Lewis, Lane and 
Barry. 

Stuck in Division II, there may 
only be one thing I can take consola-
tion in a�er the Division I Referen-
dum failed to pass — the small mo-
ments that I can look to my friend 
and make Post cereal puns.

First-Seed Baseball Set to Face Third-Seed Dixie State
good for a second place finish in the 
Pacific West conference. 

The Red Storm will be making its 
first national tournament appearance 
since moving up to Division II in 
2004. This season, Dixie State was 
propelled into the West Regional 
behind a well-rounded offense and a 
balanced bullpen. 

Right-hander Mike Dedrick 
(5–4) counts as the Red Storm’s most 
weathered starter, having pitched 
81.2 innings thus far with a 2.98 
ERA. Seniors Daniel Zapata (3.33 

ERA) and Aus Christiansen will 
likely be looked to close. Dixie State 
went through 10 different pitchers 
in their last four game series against 
the CCAA’s CSU Los Angeles.

On the mound for the Tritons, 
junior All-CCAA first team 
selection Ryan Goodbrand (10–0) 
will look to remain perfect against 
the Red Storm. Goodbrand is backed 
by a strong supporting cast in fellow 
All-CCAA selection, closer Tony 
York, starter Jeff Rauh, southpaw 
Richard Kilbury and submariner 
Elias Tuma.

The rotation will look to keep 
Dixie State’s senior catcher Joe 
Andrade and Japanese national Yuto 
Kato off the base pads. Andrade and 
Kato lead the team for games played. 
Andrade boasts the Red Storm’s 
highest slugging percentage (.483), 
while Kato counts as Dixie State’s 
most consistent hitter.

Conversely, the Triton offense 
is looking as it has been in 2012. 
The top of the order — junior 
Danny Susdorf, junior Richard 
Siegel, sophomore Garrett Tuck and 
sophomore Nick La Face — have 

proven that they’re one of the most 
lethal combinations in the CCAA. 
The Tritons will look to see if 
they’re as effective against national 
competition.

The game is slated to begin 
Thursday, May 17 at 1 p.m. The 
winner will play against the winner 
of the game between first-seed 
Western Oregon and fourth-seed 
Chico State, Friday, May 18, at 5 
p.m.

�e UCSD Softball team upset No. 1 Valdosta State in the first 
round of the College World Series.�e Trons now have three more 
games to win to take their second consecutive NCAA Division II 

National Championship.

BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor 

Freshman Monique Portugal tallied her second multiple run home run in postseason 
play to launch the Tritons past No. 
1 nationally ranked Valdosta State 
Wednesday, May 16.

This season, UCSD has 
continuously been forced to upset 
higher ranked squads. 

The Tritons came into the West 
Regionals with the sixth-seed, 
clawing their way out of the region 
by narrowly beating first-seed CSU 
Dominguez Hills in three games.

In the first round of the NCAA 

Division II Championships, UCSD 
faced the winners of the South 
Region Valdosta State (52–5), taking 
a 7–5 win.

Senior ace Camille Gaito, pitching 
her 13th straight game, retired her 
first three batters in order, setting the 
stage for a six run bottom of the first. 

Leadoff hitter Kris Lesovsky—2011 
and 2012 All-American—was moved 
to third base off a wild pitch and a 
sacrifice bunt. 

With two outs, sophomore Mya 
Romero singled to left field to bring 
Lesovsky in to score. 

UCSD went up by two more runs 
as Valdosta pitcher Alanna Hadley 
walked two more Tritons to load the 

bases with senior Nicole Spangler up 
to bat. The first baseman sent a big 
double to left field for two RBI.

With Spangler on second and 
freshman Maria Sykes on third, 
Portugal homered to left field to put 
the Tritons up a definitive 6–0.

“Hitting is contagious, and when 
I see my teammates working hard 
and finding ways to get on base and 
hitting the ball hard it makes me 
want to continue the rally and help 
my team,” Portugal said in an email 
interview. “Going up to the plate, I 
was only trying to get a base hit and 
knock in another run.”

The Tritons picked up their last 
run of the game in the bottom of the 

second as UCSD was granted three 
bases on illegal pitches, allowing 
Lesovsky to score.

Hadley was pulled in the second 
inning in favor of Valdosta’s Courtney 
Gunby, who kept UCSD scoreless in 
their remaining four innings, while 
allowing only three hits.

Valdosta picked up two runs in 
the third off a costly in-field error, 
and nearly forced extra innings in the 
bottom of the seventh. The Blazer’s 
Morgan Johnson smashed a two-run 
home run and picked up another 
run before Gaito was able to close 
them out. 

UCSD will now advance to the 
winner’s bracket, where they will face 

Kutztown (51–5) in the second leg, 
Thursday, May 17.

Kutztown — the Atlantic Region 
champions — defeated Augustana in 
its opening match 4–0. 

“I think we’re going into 
tomorrow’s game very strong,” 
Portugal said. “We were a little 
rough around the edges today, but 
our hitting couldn’t be peaking 
at a better time. As a whole, our 
team’s hitting has progressively been 
getting stronger every weekend, so 
the outcome of our games will only 
continue to get better.”

Tritons, Three Wins From World Series
BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor 

BASEBALL — With the regular 
season and CCAA tournament title 
in tow, the UCSD baseball team now 
heads up North to Keizer, Oregon 
where they will face off against Dixie 
State in the first round of the West 
Regionals.

It was announced last Sunday, 
May 13 that UCSD would enter the 
four-team West Regional as third 
seed. The Tritons will be joined by 
first-seed Western Oregon, fourth-
seed CCAA rivals Chico State as well 
as first-round opponents second-
seed Dixie State.

The Tritons have yet to face Dixie 
State this season, but will need to best 
the second-seeded squad in a three-
game series to advance to the West 
Regional final. The Red Storm enters 
the tournament with a 32–18 record, 

NOLAN THOMAS/GUARDIAN FILESee BASEBALL, page 11

Freshman (pictured le�) Monique Portugal tallied a three run homerun Wednesday, to lead the Tritons in their win against 
Valdosta.

Valdosta State last Wednesday, May 16.
