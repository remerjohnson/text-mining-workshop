BERKELEY - Students using

Analyzing 140 reports of adverse

UC San Francisco researchers 
working for the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration found that the stim-

StudentLink 
Repaired 
After Outage 
WebReg causes problems 
for students as winter 
quarter registration begins 
By ED WU 
Staff Writer 

Students attempting to register for class-
es last Wednesday found themselves unable 
to do so, as StudentLink's Web Reg system 
was beleaguered on the first day of under-
graduate registration for winter' quarter. 

Due to the discontinuation of the TeSS 
telephone registration system this quarter, 
WebReg, an Internet tool for adding and 
dropping classes, was left as students' only 
means to register for classes at UCSD aside 
from walking into the Registrar's office. 

Students primarily affected by the irregu-
larity in service were ath letes, Regents schol-
ars and ational Merit scholars who have 
the privilege of first-day registration . 

The first sign of trouble came around 
8:30 a.m., when athletes with the earliest 
registration times found the system inopera-
ble. 

"! ran back from water polo practice at 
8:1 S a.m. to register and! had no problems," 
Muir freshman Laura Holshouser said, a 
goaltender for the women's water polo team. 
"But, some of the girls who got back at 8:30 
a.m. found out they couldn't register." 

Holshouser was the one of few without 
problems during the day. 

As registration opened to Regents and 
National Merit Scholars beginning at 10 
a.m., they too found the system inoperably 
slow as they attempted to register for classes. 
Web Reg allowed students to access the 
add/drop screen for winter quarter, but 
would return errors, stating an inability to 
connect to the student database as soon as 
students attempted to add a section. 

However, many students found a simple 
solution to their woes by walking to the 
Registrar's office. 

"I first tried to register at about 10 a.m.," 
Revelle freshman Nick Butko said. "Then, I

Many UCSD Expansion Projects in the Works 
High admissions prompts UC President to suggest construction on university campuses 

Associate News Editor 

As a result of recommenda-
tions by the UC president to 
expand the university campuses 
nearly a year ago, UCSD is in the 
process of designing a new large 
expansion set to completely open 
by 2004. 

·We have taken more students 
than we had contemplated; said 
Director of Campus Planning 
Nada Borsa. ·We expect more to 
be graduating from high school 
and going on as well." 

Borsa said expansion will soon 
be in the works at UC Irvine and 

UC Riverside as they too have 
room to expand their campuses. 

Currently, over 15 large expan-
sions are in the design or con-
struction phase at UCSD and 
should be completed within the 
next five years. 

Of substantial consequence to 
UCSD students will be the open-
ing of the new Eleanor Roosevelt 
College on the north side of cam-
pus in 2002. The possibility of sev-
enth and eighth coUeges are cur-
rently being discussed, although 

. the likelihood of their existence 
has yet to be determined. 

·We aren't sure how many col-
leges we are going to have,· Borsa 

said. "The problem is that we can't 
build that (ar to the North because 
it will be hard to get to class with-
in 15'minutes: 

For this reason, classes in 
Galbraith Hall were canceled 
because students walking from 
there to Warren Lecture Hall 
could not walk to class on time. 

In addition, construction starts 
later this month on the new 
Natural Science building while a 
new computer science building is 
currently in the process of being 
designed. There are plans for a 
new theater between the Mandell 
Weiss Theater and the dance facil-
ity, as well. 

"As the growth of students 
continues to occur, new facilities 
like housing will have to be 
expanded; Borsa said. 

The number of undergraduates 
is expected to grow from 17,000 to 
23,000 in the next 10 years, and 
the number of students in total 
will climb to 31,000. 

Some students, however, are 
opposed to this large increase in 
students on campus. 

"It could make upper division 
classes harder to enroll in: Muir 
sophomore Steve Reis said. ·At the 
same time it will spread out the

BRIEFLY 
UCSD Spine Surgeon Wms Honor 

Steven R. Garfin, professor and chair of the 
UCSD School of Medicine department of ortho-
pedics, has been awarded the Wiltse Award by 
the North American Spine Society during its 
annual meeting in New Orleans. 

The Wiltse Award is given to physicians who 
make significant contributions in the field of 
spine surgery through research, teaching or 
through other innovations. The award is named 
after Leon Wiltse, M.D., a founder of NASS and a 
pioneer in the area of spine surgery. 

Garfin received the award because he has 
dedicated his life to surgery to help patients suf· 
fering from spine disorders. 

Garfin has also contributed to many pub-
lished papers and books regarding spine care, 
with a special interest in cervical spine surgery. 

ScrIpps scI.ntlst receive. 
Packard F.llowshlp 

Jeffrey Severinghaus, a geochemist at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UCSD, 
has been awarded a Packard Fellowship to study 
the stability of past and future climates. 

Severinghaus is an associate professor in the 
geOSCiences research division at Scripps and 
specializes in analyzing Earth's climate by study-
ing air trapped in ice cores. He is known for dis-
covering the cause of sudden climate changes 
that occurred just before the birth of civilization 
12,000 years ago. 

The $625,000 fellowship will be grant!!d over 
5 years. It will allow Severinghaus to determine 
how methane, a colorless, odorless gas, can 
offer clues about Earth's climate. 

UCSD Bum Center r.I ..... 
1191 statistics 

The UCSD Regional Burn Center released its 
annual report Tuesday on people'from San Diego 
and Imperial counties admitted to the center 
from January through December of 1999. 

Patients admitted during that time for 
Injuries and smoke inhalation numbered 440. 
There was an increases of 68 burn patients from 
the previous year. 

Most patients were adults. However, infants 

and small children constituted 93 admissions, a 
23 percent increase from 1998. 

Most reported injuries to younger patients 
were caused by home accidents, with most 
involving cooking or scalding accidents. Contact 
with hot objects such as curling irons and cloth-
ing irons, hot coals, fireworks, gasoline, gun-
powder and barbecues were also common burn 
causes. 

It was found that most adult patients had 
come into direct contact with fire or flames, 
most often caused by cooking accidents. The 
majority of adults were burned in their homes. 

The Burn Center at UCSD was established in 
1973 to provide specialized care for severely 
burned individuals.

Workers Discuss Strategies for Disabled 
Career Services panel adresses student's career related concerns 

Contributing News Writer 

A panel of three distinguished 
members of the disabled commu-
nity spoke at the Career Services 
Center Tuesday afternoon, 
addressing career strategies for stu-
dents with disabilities in a career 
exploration panel co-sponsored by 
Career Services and the UCSD 
Alumni Association. 

The panel's primary goal was to 
provide people with disabilities the 
opportunity to leam from those 
who had succeeded in their 
careers, despite various physical 
and nonvisible impairments. 

The panelists addressed the 
audience in a prearranged ques-
tion-and-answer format with 
information about their own career 
paths. They discussrd the rewards 
and challen,Ees of their respective 
careers by tackling issues such as 
disclosure and accommodation in 
the job search process. 

The .three panelists were Steven 
Brock, an advisory software engi-
neer for IBM Corporation; 
Jonath.an Mooney, two-time 
author and executive director of 

StudentUnk: 
Students still expressed 
support far WebReg 
ContI ..... rr- PIC- 1 
called the Registrar's, and they 
said, 'It's down, they're fixing it: 
Come here and register.' So I went 
there and registered. [t was easy-
it took about two minutes per per-
son with two windows open, and 
there were only about five people 
there." 

Registrar's office staff reported 
more traffic than Butko witnessed. 
A staff member who asked not to 
be named said that on Nov. 1, 
"traffic [there] was very heavy as a 
result of StudentLink being 
down." 

Later that evening, 

Expansion: 
Fifteen projects are 
planned far UCSD 
c-tI ................. l 
very talented faculty that we have 
right now among more people." 

However, the Medical Center 
only stands to have .an increase in 
services available on this campus. 

Currently, the new Brain 
Imaging Center in the Medicai 
Center is set to open in lS months, 
the Eye Center will be expanded 
next year, the new Cancer Center 

his own nonprofit organization 
Eye-to-Eye; and Valois Vera, 
employment coordinator at The 
Access Center of San Diego. 

Brock, who is deaf, received a 
Bacheior of Science degree in 
accounting from California State 
University at Northridge and has 
been working for IBM for lS years. 
Brock now provides technical con-
sulting for many major corpora-
tions including Exxon, Target and 
Motorola. He also serves on the 
Internal Corporate Advisory 
Council for People with 
Disabilities. 

Brock 'spoke of the difficulties 
he faced as a rrsult of being hard of 
hearing in the workplace. 

"A disability becomes even 
more of a challenge as the face of a 
management team changes: Brock 
said. 

Mooney, who is dyslexic and 
has attention defici t hyperactive 
disorder, is nationally recognized 
for his lecturing on learning dis-
abilities and cognitive diversity. 

"People have this misconcep-
tion that learning is about menial 
things like spelling and reading, 
when it it's actually about ideas." 

StudentLink was completely shut 
down and a nutice was posted that 
stated: "We are curreptly experi-
encing technical difficulties." 

By late that night, the system 
wa~ apparently working again. 

Marty Backer of Administrative 
Computing and Telecommunica-
tion tried to allay campus concerns 
about the technical difficulties. 

"We have not solved the prob-
iem at this time," Backer said. "But 
can assure you and all students 
that it is not related to the volume 
of students beginning their regis-
tration process for winter quar-
ter." 

There were difficulties the next 
day as Web Reg posted a message 
asking students to retry their 
request, should they run into any 
trouble. However, the system was 
once again slow and barely opera-

with the new, state-funded phar-
macy school will open in 2004. in 
addition, designs have been made 
for a new medical research center. 

"The med school's already great 
- the expansion will make it even 
better." Revelle sophomore Eisha 

. Christian said. "This may put us in 
the top 10 med schools in the 
country." 

New temporary parking lots in 
the Medical Center and in East 
parking will be built to help ease 
the parking problems that may be 
associated with the construction of 
new structures. 

Borsa said these interim lots 

. Mooney said. 
Having graduated from Brown 

University in May with a 4.0 grade 
point ' average 'and a degree in 
English Literature, Mooney has 
already authored two books, 
including Learning Outside the 
Lines, a handbook for academic 
success for students who think dif-
ferently. He is now the founder 
and head of Project Eye-to-Eye, 
which pairs young children who 
have ADHD with college students 
with the same condition to help 
kids cope with the learning disabil-
ity. 

"People don't seem to under-
stand that ADHD is a facet of my 
mind, not a disease, as it is with all 

. physical and nonvisible disabilities 
alike" Mooney said. 

Above all, the panelists stressed 
the idea that disabilities and 
accommodation for those who suf-
fer from them is a diversity issue 
very similar to race or gender rela-
tions and that people with disabili-
ties are basically like everybody 
else. 

"I'm married, I have sex, I drink 
beer and I like sports ... ['m just 
like any reguiar guy; Vera said. 

ble. 
"We had to keep trying for, like, 

an hour, repeating the same thing 
over and over: Muir freshman' 
Cori Atkinson said, who admitted 
that she was able to register on her 
second try . 

While it would be easy to corre-
late the first-day failure of 
StudentLink to the discontinua-
tion of TeSS, this apparently was 
not the case. 

"[Nov. 1] was not an unusual 
volume for student WebReg: 
Backer stated. 

Many students expressed sup-
port for WebReg over TeSS regard-
less of system irregularities. 

"I would actually prefer the 
Internet, even if it is slower, 
because there's a weekly planner 
to make sure you do nothing stu-
pid." Atkinson said. 

might become full structures in the 
future once the funding has been 
allocated. 

An outside consulting firm has 
been hired to determine the 
sources of the parking problems 
on campus. Borsa said one possible 
solution would be the construction 
of new parking structures, 
although this is currently unlikely. 

"We need to determine how 
many spots we will need and what 
kind of policies we will need to 
adopt," Borsa said. "We also need 
to figure out how many we can 
afford to make before permit prices 
become too high."

UCSD Democrats 
Decieva Through 
Use of School Logo 

Voter information guides are meant to be 
informative, not misleading. Last week, the 
UCSD College Democrats distributed a 
voter guide on campus, listing their 
endorsements for various positions and 
propositions. 

We at the Guardian, however, find the 
guide grossly misleading. The front of the 
guid~ says, "UCSD Student Voter Guide, 
Election Day, November 7th 2000" and 
includes an official UCSD logo. 

The logo, which abstractly resembles 
~eisel . Library, is generally used side-by-
Side with the name UCSD. We feel that it 
was misused, leading students to believe 
that the guide was prepared by the universi-
ty or the A.S. Council. 

The back of the guide includes endorse-
ments, listing and endorsing the Democratic 
candidates for president, U.S. senator, U.S. 
representative, state senator and state 
assembly. It also made recommendations on 
the eight propositions. "Paid for by UCSD 
College Democrats" is printed at the very 
bottom of the endorsements, as well as a 
Web address for the College Democrats. 

The Guardian feels that the College 
Democrats should not mislead students. 
"UCSD Student Voter Guide" is extremely 
vague, and the name does not even offer

by a partisan student group. 

The front of the voter guide should have 
been appropriately labeled, making it clear 
that the guide was put out by the UCSD 
College Democrats, and not made or paid 
for by the university. 

Others apparently felt the same way. 
On election day, members of the UCSD

Dead Heat Election Unneccesary 
in Light of Gore's Advantages 

Closely contested race could haye gone to vice president had he pressed the 
strength of an econOlTIlC boom and taken Nader seriously 

By 'OM vu 
Opinion Editor 

At 9:10 p.m. Tuesday, George W. 
Bush and AI Gore were tied in Electoral 
Votes, at 242 each. Bush had won 
Arkansas and its six votes while Gore 
won Washington with it's 11 votes. As 
Brian Williams from NBC so eloquent-
ly put it: "They don't get any deader 
than this dead heat." Even though the 
pre~identia.1 ele~tion has yet to be 
decIded, thIS artIcle will look at some 
interesting aspects of the race and some 
trends that it revealed. 

[n the next. couple of days, everyone, 
from the media to political analysts to 
t~e loser of this election, will be asking 
hlm- or herself: Why is this election so 
close? 

[t is even tighter than the 1960 e1ec-
tio~s ber,ween ~ix~n and Kennedy, to 
whIch thIS electIon IS continuously jux-
taposed. Everyone had predicted a close 
election but did it really need to be this 
close? 

The answer is: No. 
This was not an election that had to 

be forced down to the wire as it cur-
rently is. 

No~ to take any credit away from 
Bush If he IS declared the winner but 
this is an election that Gore sh'ould 
have won , hands down. 

This nation is only now coming out 
of the economic boom that the 
Clinton-Gore administration over-
looked. True, they had little to do with . 
moving the nation into the New 
Economy, but, as proved by voter pref-
erences throughout numerous elec-
tions, this matters little. 

As long as t~e J:?eople live in pros-
per~us ~conomlc times, they vote, in 
theIr mmds, to keep the good times 
rolling. Being vice president, Gore 
automatically inherited this from Bill 
Clinton. 

S~cond, the United States is at peace. 
ObVIously there are still terrorist nations, 

I 

but America is not involved in a war 
while entering this election. 

When Nixon won the presidency in 
1968, the nation was tom by the Vietnam 
War . . Gore and Bush, and thankfully 
America, are not faced with this situa-
tion . 

As a result, there is no excuse for the 
election to be as close as it is. [f Bush is 
declared the winner, it is because Gore 
gave him that opportunity. 

What about the Nader effect? [t is 
obvious to anyone that looks that the 
popular votes in the close states that 
Nader changed the outcome. 

This was not an election that 
had to be forced down to the 
wire as it currently is. Not to 
take any credit away from 
Bush if he is declared the 
winner, but this is an election 
that Gore should have won, 
hands down. 

[f even one-half of the votes in 
Florida that went to Nader went to 
Gore, the state would have tipped to 
Gore's favor. As Lawrence O'Donnell, a 
commentator, said, "[f George Bush 
wins Florida, the first phone call he 
needs to make is to Ralph Nader to 
thank him." 

However, this goes back to the earlier 
argument: Gore had the opportunity to 
pull ahead but did not take advantage of 
it. He had the money and he knew far 
enough ahead the trouble that Nader 
presented. Because he did not act, some-
one else will determine his political 
future. 

What docs this presidential election 
show about the national trends? 

ConSidering how the senatorial races 
art developing. with the possibility of 

having a 50-50 split, it means the nation 
is decidedly moderate. 

Though Republicans still, surprising-
ly, hold the House, it is with a much 
slimmer majority. Americans have con-
verged to the center. Consider the past 
few presidential and midterm elections. 

The last time we had a unified gov-
ernment was in 1992. Since then 
Americans have divided the govern~ 
ment between the two parties. With 
each election, the number of seats that 
the majority Republicans held has 
slowly shrunk. . 

Now, the difference in the House is 
I~s~ than a dozen and there is a possi-
bIlity that th: Senate w!1I be evenly split 

. down the mIddle, leavmg the deciding 
vote to the vice president, whomever 
that may be. This would be the first 
time since 1882 that something like 
this happened. 

As unified as this nation may seem in 
her politics, on~ look at the electoral map 
shows how dIfferently one American 
views the candidates than the other. 
Down the middle of the nation: Bush 
Red. On the coasts: Gore Blue. While 
Americans may be moderate, each 
American's view of what, and who, is 
moderate varies greatly. 

Some consider Gore and his New 
Democrats as centrists. Others view 
Bu~h and his' compassionate conser-
vatism to be the middle. . 

This presidential election indicates 
the cultural and regional differences of 
the nation. MStarbuck's VS. Dunkin' 
Donuts: as CNBC commentator Chris 
Matthews calls it. 

What will this mean for America? 
The next president can win the elections 
wi.thout winning the popular vote, some-

~hmg th~t has happened only three times 
In the hIstory of the United States. Will 
the Electoral College be scrapped? Will a 
dead man be elected to the Senate? Only 
time will tell. 

Until then, sit tight; we're in store for 
a wild ride. 

Thursday. November 9, 2000 The UCSD Guardian 

Administrative decision to ban pirate costume is foolish 

Apparently, the UCSD trans-
portation department has lost 
its sense of humor. 

Last week, it informed 
Debbie Evans, a shuttle driver, 
that she is no longer allowed to 
act like a pirate on her shuttle. 

Since the beginning of the 
school year. when she started 
her shuttle-driving career, 
Evans has worn a red bandanna, 
an eye patch (not over any eyes, 
of course). and occasionally a 
fake hook or parrot while on the 
job. She-had greeted passengers 
with an occasional "Ahoy, 
matey!" or "Arrrggg!" mixed in 
with the standard "Hello: 
, [n doing this, Evans livened 

up the atmosph.ere on the 
Regents East shuttle. amusing 
some, if not all of the passen-
gers. 

Even the ones who didn 't 
find her funny didn't complain 
about it; Evans was not repri-
manded because of any cus-
tomer complaints. 

Her superior's decision to ban 
the pirate act came after other 
shuttle drivers complained that it 
was "unprofessional." 

While I respect the right .of 
Shuttle Operations to set stan-
daf'ds for its employees and to 
enforce them. in this case it has 
made a poor decision. 

There are no rules prohibiting 
shuttle drivers from attempting 
to entertain their passengers. In 
her act, Evans did not put anyone 
in danger. nor did she do any-
thing to make her passengers 
doubt her ability as a driver. 

Her actions may have been. as 
the other drivers say, "unprofes-
sional; but I don't think that the 
word is very well-applied to the 
profession of shul!le driving. 

If it were. truly a professional 
situation requiring a professional 
demeanor. shuttle drivers would 

Perhaps the 
transportation 
department should 
worry less about the 
acting skills of its . 
employees and more 
about their ability to 
drive. 
likely be prohibited from playing 
their own music, talking to 
friends while they drive, and wav-
ing at each other all the time. 

If this were an issue of safety, I 
would be the first to SllppOrt the 
transportation department. Last 
year, a driver on the shuttle out to 
East Parking bothered me not 
because of his appearance or his 
greetings but because of his total 
lack of safe driving skills. 

There were more than a few . 
times on that shuttle where I 
expected it to tip over going 

around a curve. 
I don't know about you, but 

I'll ta/(e a talkative pirate over a 
threat to my safety any day. 
Perhaps the transportation 
department should worry less 
about the acting skills of its 
employees and more about their 
ability to drive. 

This is much less a case of 
safety or of professionalism 
than it is a case of wanting to 
preserve the status quo. Evans' 
co-workers and superiors, faced 
with an expression of individu-
alism they hadn't seen before, 
decided to reject it as different 
instead of judging it at face 
value. 

From what I have been told 
by Evans and by the 
Transportation Office, this issue 
is still unresolved. 

Evans retains her desire to 
brighten up the mood on the 
shuttle with her rendition of 
"Yo ho, yo ho," and her superi-
ors are still stopping her from 
doing so. 

I personally am saddened by 
this because I'm tired of being 
bored on the shuttle. 

UCSD is not the most excit-
ing school in the world, and we 
should be doing all that we can 
to support a little bit of diversity 
and individuality. 

If you share my sentiments 
and would like to see the reap-
pearance of Pirate Debbie on 
the shuttle system. please call 
Shuttle Operations at (858) 
534-6282 to voice your opin-
ions.

Intelligence Authorization 
Act Vetoed by Clinton 
Veto of controversial act solidifies 
citizens' access to important information 
By JI NNIFER SPOIITO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Proponents of the Intelligence 
Authorization Act were sent into 
an uproar this week after 
President Clinton vetoed the con-
troversial piece of legislation. 
After a difficult process of deliber-
ation, Clinton vetoed the act to 
the chagrin of authorities such as 
Janet Reno and organizations 
such as the CIA. However, 
Clinton's action champion~ the 
right of free speech and the right 
of the press to keep the public 
informed. 

The [ntelligence Authorization 
Act itself seems ordinary. It is fis-
cal in nature - legislation autho-
rizing the distribution of funds to 
various governmental intelligence 
agencies for 2001 . Buried within 
it, though, is an "anti-leak" clause, 
so termed because it makes the 
leaking of classified information 
by a government official a felony 
punishable by three years in 
prison. 

Current law criminalizes the 
leaking of defense-related classi-
fied information and other types 
of highly sensitive 'information 
related to national security. The 
Intelligence Authorization Act's 
clause would have created sweep-
ing changes with the potential to 
impinge free speech. ' 

For one, the broad nature of the 
clause's language caused confusion 
among members of Congress, 
proving that it would be difficult to 
enforce. Confusion ensued in 
Congressional debates as to 

whether the clause would be 
applicable to members of Congress 
themselves, and whether those who 
benefit from the information 
leaked would be subject to perse-
cution. 

It is not difficult to see why this 
aspect of the clause would be a 
matter of concern to those with a 
vested interest in protecting free 
speech. The editors of the New York 
TImes and the Washington Post sent 
letters to Clinton,urging him to 
veto the legislation. Critics of the 
act recognized immediately that it 
would have been an attack on the 
roots of democracy to leave the 
press susceptible to persecution for 
informing the people. 

The clause's broad language 
also caused legislators to w~>nder if 
its wording would allow the 
Executive Branch free reign to 
determine what denotes "classi-
fied" information . 

Unlike previous provisions, the 
Intelligence Authori za tion Act's 
clause does not speci fica lly state 
that matters such as Execut ive 
Branch gaffes cannot be classified . 
If the clause had become law, a 
president with a pern icious past 
could have exploited its harsh 
penalt ies to his adva ntage: 
Imagine what would happen if a 
president were to classifY a major 
flub, only to prosecute the gov-
ernment official who leaked it to 
the press. . 

The term "classified" would no 
longer denote a status of secrecy 
for the protection of the nation -

Though a breach of trust can harm 
the nation, it is imbued with the 
potential to affect the nation posi-

Experience tells us that leaks to 
the media, even of "classified"

there are so few

Thus Reno did not assert that the

New Violence Man Eve of 
Talks to Rescue Peace 

JERUSALEM - On the eve of a 
meeting between President Clinton 
and Yasser Arafa t to try to salvage 
the shattered peace effort, new 
bloodletting.Jlroke out Wednesday 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
Four Palestinian teen-agers were 
fatally shot in clashes with Israeli 
troops, and Palestin ian gunmen 
killed an Israeli woman. 

Arafat, the Palestinian leader, 
left on Wednesday for Washington, 
stopping)n Cairo for talks with 
President Hosni Mubarak of 
Egypt. He is scheduled to meet on 
Thursday with Clinton, who is try-
ing to revive peace efforts devastat-
ed by nearly six weeks of street 
clashes and gun battles that have 
left .more than 180 people dead, 
most of them Palestinians. 

The violence has persisted 
despite a truce agreed upon last 
week and an earlier cease-fire 
reached last month. So there was 
little expectation by either Israeli or 
Palestinian officials that Clinton's 
discussions with Arafat, or a sepa-
rate meeting with Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak of Israel on Sunday, 
would lead to new peace talks 
soon. 

Arafat is expected to press 
Clinton for an international force 
to ~rotect Palestinians in the West 

Bank and Gaza Strip. But Barak has 
dismissed the idea as "a reward for 
the Palesti!)ian violence: and U. . 
Secretary-General Kofi Anan has 
said that such a force could not be 
stationed without Israeli agree-
ment. But the U.N. Security 
Council has agreed to hear a direct 
appeal from Arafat this week for a 
2,000-member U.N. force. 

Barak sent a letter to world 
leaders Wednesday in which he 
accused Arafat of resorting to vio-
lence and cautioned against a uni-
lateral Palestinian dedaration of 
independel)ce. While spelling out a 
readiness to accept Palestinian 
statehood, the prime minister cau-
tioned that it could only come 
about through negotiations. 

Barak also announced that the 
deaths of 13 [sraeli Arabs killed in a 
wave of protests last month will be 
investigated by a state inquiry com-
mission. He had originally appoint-
ed a fact-finding comminee with 
less authority than a state commis-
sion, but changed his mind under 
pressure from aides, legal experts 
and Israeli-Arab leaders who said 
they would boycott the panel 
unless there was a full state inquiry.

Corzine ~revails in New 
Jersey Senate Race With Bid 

NEW JERSEY - Jon Corzine, a 
liberal Democrat who made a for-
tune as a Wall Street executive and 
spent about $60 million of it on his 
first campaign for public office, 
won election to New Jersey's open 
seat in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday 
after shattering the national spend-
ing record for a statewide ~ce. 

Corzine fended off a deter-
mined but poorly financed chal-
lenge from Rep. Bob Franks by 
outspending him 10 to 1, 
unleashing a ceaseless, nine-
week-long barrage of television 
advertisements and an army of 
political foot soldiers who 
searched out votes in inner-city 
housing complexes and sprawling 
subdivisions across the state. 

[n selecting Corzine, 53, the for-
mer chairman of Goldman, Sachs 
& Co., to succeed the retiring 
Frank Lautenberg, New Jersey vot-
ers chose the Democratic candi-
date's vision of ambitious but cost-
ly new government programs in 
health care and education over 
Franks' more frugal and cautious 
approach to solving social prob-
lems. 

With 89 percent of precincts 

reporting, Corzine had received 51 
percent of the popular vote, com-
pared with 47 percent for Franks. 

Corzine, who roughly doubled 
the previous spending record for a 
Senate race set by the Republican 
Michael Huffington in a losin$ bid 
in California in 1994, greeted Jubi-
lant supporters at his East 
Brunswick hotel at 11 :40 p.m. 

Twenty minutes earlier, Franks, 
conceding defeat in nearby New 
Brunswick, called Corzine a "good 
and decent man." 

The Senate race in New Jersey 
was tame compared with recent 
statewide contests, most notably 
the 1996 campaign between Sen. 
Robert Torricelli and Rep. Richard 
Zimmer. It also lacked the star 
power the race between Hillary 
Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick 
Lazio in New York. 

Although the campaign grew 
heated in its final days, and each 
side's television commercials more 
strident, both Corzine and Franks 
mainly confined their attacks to the 
issues.

By 4 a.m. Wednesday, the

only the barest of margins in the 
popular and electoral votes as the 
electorate seemed agonizingly 
split between Gore and Bush. 

Bush was able to claim much 
of the South, while Gore cap-
tured the largest states on both 
coasts. But the two divided a 
patchwork of Midwestern states 
that are crucial for victory.

GOP Clings to Control as Democrats Gain in Both Houses 
Democratic gains in the House 

and Sena te Tuesday fell short of 
control but produced the most 
narrowly divided Congress in 
almost half a century. Democrats 
gained at least three Senate seats 
and one or two in the House. 

With one Senate race undecid-
ed, Republicans had 50 seats and 
Democrats 49. [n the House, 
Republicans won an apparent 
majority of 221-211, with two inde-
pendents, and one seat undecided 
with the Democratic candidate 
leading. But Republicans asserted 
that recounts or absentee ballots 
wQuld give them twO or three of the 

seats where Democrats now had 
moJ;C votes, and Democrats predict-
ed that a recount would get them 
one Rtpublican seat. 

The last time both houses were 
divided so closely was at the end of 
the 83rd Congress of 1953-55, 
when Republicans ended with a 
49-46 Senate edge (with one inde-
pendent) and the House had 219 
Republicans, 215 Democrats and 
one independent. 

But that was an entirely differ-
ent era, when lawmakers drank and 
golfed together and blunt partisan-
ship as seen in today's attack ad~ 
was almost unheard of. A Widely 

recalled saying of the time . has , a 
senior Democrat correcting a 
freshman who called House 
Republicans the "enemy." 

The elder Democrat explained: 
"The Republicans are the opposi-
tion. The Senate is the enemy." 

There were some bows to the 
older spirit today. Sen. john Ashcroft 
of Missouri, the Republican who 
was narrowly beaten by the late Mel 
Carnahan after Carnahan's widow 
agreed to accept appointment if he 
won, rejected any legal challenge to 
the result, saying, "[ believe that the 
will of the people has been expressed 
With compassion, and the will of the 

people shquld be respected." 
The Senate results followed a 

pattern widely anticipated in recent 
weeks. Democrats won five 
Republican seats, defeating incum-
bents in Delaware, Michigan , 
Minnesota and Missouri, and win-
ning the Republican seat in Florida 
opened up by Connie Mack's 
retirement. They could still win 
one more, because several thou-
sand absentee ballots in 
Washington state may overcome 
Sen. Slade Gorton's current 3,197 
vote margin and give the seat to 
Maria Cantwell. a former 
Democratic representative. 

But even if Cantwell wins and 
the Senate is divided 50-50, 
Republicans would be in control. If 
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is 
elected president, his vice-presi-
dent, Dick Cheney, would cast a 
tie- breaking 101 st vo~e. If Vice 
President AI Gore wins the presi-
dency, Sen. joseph Lieberman, re-
elected Tuesday to the Senate, 
would resign to become vice presi-
dent and a Republican would be 
appointed to succeed him, break-
ing the tic.

The Wallflowers to

inter may be 
rearing its ugly 
head but 
Thursday 
night the 
flowers will be 

in bloom - The Wallflowers 
that is - at the University of 
San Diego's Jenny Craig Pavil-
ion. It has been a long time 
since The Wallflowers were last 
in the spotlight with their 1996 
album "Bringing Down The 
Horse: 

Six million copies and four 
years later, lead singer Jakob 
Dylan, keyboardist Rami Jaffee, 
bassist Greg Richling, guitarist 
Michael Ward and drummer 
Mario Calire are finally ready to 
take the stage once again. 

The Wallflowers have 
returned in the nick of time. 
Four years between albums is a 
long time, t:;pecially in an 
industry where pop acts are 
cranking out Christmas albums, 
multiple singles and remixes, 
one after another.

in danger of winding up on VH-

gram. However, rock critics will 
always pay attention to The 
Wallflowers. Every song Dylan 
writes will be dissected for any 
glimpse of what life is like when 
you are - .as put by both Rolling 
Stone and Elle magazines -
"Son of Bob." 

It is inevitable that Dylan is 
singled out from the rest of 
the band in almost every inter-
view or article. The Wallflow-
ers are very much his band. 
After the band practically dis-
solved following its unsuc-
cessful self-titled debut on 
Virgin Records, Dylan an~ 
keyboardist Jaffee recruited 
what became the Wallflowers' 
new lineup, and recorded 
"Bringing Down The Horse: 
The album's first single, "6th 
Avenue Heartache," had 
already been playing on mod-
ern-rock radio and VH-1 long · 
before rock journalists made 
the connection between Dylan 
and his legendary father. 

It was clear that the 
younger Dylan was not about

to let music press drift in the 
direction of his father. Thus, 
the band embarked on two-
and-a-half years of touring, 
playing over 270 shows in 
1997 alone. The. album pro-
duced three hit singles, "6th

Grammy for Best Rock Song, 
proving this band had legs of

criticized for being too imper-
sonal in his songwriting and 
on stage. In other words, not 
talking about or referring to 
his father enough to satisfy 
rock historians' insatiable 
appetite for a glimpse into the 
life of Bob Dylan. 

Shy by nature, Dylan often 
feared achieving too much suc-
cess. He admitted to Rolling 
Stone last month that he is a 
reluctant rock star.

Music Department Students Go With Their Flow 
Jazz Improvisation performance is intelligent, experiemehtal and cheap 
By LINDSAY SWORSKI 
Hiatus Editor 

Dueling saxophones, vocal 
wanderings, talking trumpets, 
drum solos and even turntables -
hell, just about any sound may be 
included in this quarters Jazz 
Improvisation performance. 

On Monday the students of 
George Lewis' music 131 class will 
present a night of improvisation 
running from swinging versions of 
traditional standards to loose inter-
pretations of experimental scores. 
Yet despite the title of the class, this 
performance will include a . Iot 
more than what people typically 
consider to be "jazz." 

''I'm not really interested in jazz: 
Lewis explained. "Well, I love it ... 
but I have a problem with the word." 
A music isn 't alive to grow if it is too 
defined. "I prefer the garage ba.nd 
model; there is no one looking over 
your shoulder, pointing their finger." 

Many students don't realize that 
the UCSD music departmen t is 
one of the most innovati ve in the 
country. Beyond the typical classi-
cal repertoire, our music depart-
ment pays attention to the last cen-
tury of musical development and 
expands on the outdated canon of 
significant composers. The depart-
ment houses amazing composers 
and performers who are active 
tOday ....,. fac ul ty, graduate and 
undergraduate. However, impro-
vised music is still gaining respect. 

"There could be a lot more inter-
est in jazz and other types of impro-
vised music: Lewis said. "The 
department is moving towards giv-
ing improvised music more credit." 

Jazz, of course, is one of the 

most amazing musical forms to 
have come out of the last century. 

ew ideas of collective jamming, 
vocal quality, distortions, percus-
sion significance were developed 
throughout the history of jazz -
from the earliest days of Dixieland, 
swing, Ellington, bebop and free 
jazz. All of these forms are present 
in the "type" of jazz that's going 
around today. 

A great example of what is going 
on today will be heard at Monday's 
concert. Some of the best musicians 
here at UCSD will play time-hon-
ored jazz standards, classics from the 
bebop era, experimental collabora-
tions and compositions of their own. 

I've seen pieces that involve peo-
ple running across the stage and 
pieces that involve the creative 
scratching of records on two turnta-
bles. Lewis is a great facilitator for 
this class because he knows how to 
use what's new while respecting the 
past; how to keep the art of impro-
vised music alive and kicking. 

" I like an atmosphere where stu-
dents feel nurtured - I'm tired of 
directing: Lewis sa id. "I want the 
students to direct the music them-
selves. That's the danger of the ped-
agogy - it's so authoritarian. 

"I have a multigenre back-
ground in music; contemporary 
notated music, computer music, 
jazz, etc.," Lewis added. "But my 
students' backgrounds are different 
than mine. I don't want to give 
them my experience, I want them 
to use what they have - I'm learn-
ing from them." . 

Hopefully, Lewis himself will 
play. He is a well-known trombonist, 
improviser, composer and multime-
dia artist and has worked with some 

of the best in all hiS areas of interest. 
He ha~ been directing this class 
since 1991, touching on all types of 
techniques, concepts and styles. He 
has watched the class change over 
the years. accepting more and more 
forms of improvisational explo-

rations and student input. 
"You know, I wish for more 

musicians," Lewis said. "There are 
18,000 students on this eampus. I 
don't want total beginners - but if 
students know how to play their 
instruments they can always learn 

to improvise." 
If you are a big fan of improvi-

sational music you should check 
out this concert and if you know 
absolutely nothing about improvi-

They ended the series for a reason . Girls 
can only flip their hair and smile like dolls for 
so long before audiences get bored and look 
for other forms of entertainment. 

"Charlie's Angels" is overflowing with 
plenty of fighting action and heavy makeup. 
There is a sufficient amount of eye candy for 
both sexes to wi thstand the fil m, but I would-
n't recommend to this one more than once. 
Let me explain. 

The directors and producers tried their 
very best to imitate and ridicule the popular 
1970s series. Consequently, the three Angels, 
Cameron Diaz, Lucy Lu and Drew Barry-
more, did a fine job of running around in 
tight, revealing clothing, looking tough yet 
perfectly cute and primped, and beating up 
some attractive bad guys without smearing 

their lipstick. All while they attempted to 
maintain the happy, yet typical, lives of inde-
pendent Los Angeles women. . 

In spite of the predictable ending and the 
lack of any relevant dialogue, I was enter-
tained for the majority of the film. However, 
by the end I didn't have any trouble departing 
from the movie theater. 

For some reason, the movie had a lighter 
atmosphere than the series. Some funny 
cameos were included; Bill Murray and Tom 
Green presented their quirky one-liners and 
L.L. Cool J dropped in for a minute or two. It 
was fun to watch and even more fun to make 
fun of, but that's about it - no real message 
given, no moral to be learned. 

Just a quick tip before you buy your ticket: 
Walk in with the notion that the movie will be 
horrible and it will actually turn out to be bet-
ter than you expected. And don 't forget to say 
hi to Charlie for me. 

Old Sound of New Order 
Classic band releases a live album from 
its earliest days as a fresh sound 
Iy JOSEPH LEE 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

NEW ORDER · 
BBC Radio - Live in Concert 

Fuel 2000 Records 

A-
New Order can be described as one of the 

most definitive bands of the '80s and one of 
the earliest founders of ecstasy-driven techno. 
They have produced some of the greatest club 
hits of all time and they are continuing to be 
remixed by Perfecto, Shep Pettibone and 
Armand Van Heiden. The original mix of 
"Bizarre Love 1riangle" can still rock any 
party with good musical taste. 

However, in the live album they recently 
re-released for the American public, you can 
hear just how vulnerable and uncomfortable 
New Order were with their success at Glas-
tonbury in 1987. 

Bernard Sumner, the frontman of New 
Order, was still recovering from the suicide of 
his close friend and bandleader Ian Curtis. 
Curtis had led Joy Division to mythical pro-
portions and from its ashes ca me New Order. 
Sumner was not sure how to handle his col-
league's death, but in the memory of Curtis, 
New Order pushed on . 

In this timeless recording of their show in 
Glastonbury you can hear the energy and 
nervousness of the New Order performance. 
Being on stage took away their cool and clean 
studio sound and revealed the abrasive guitar 
of Bernard Sumner over the melody of Gillian 
Gilbert's keyboards and Peter Hook's defini-
tive bass riffs. Their sound is reminiscent of a 
punk-rock group pushed along by the tech-
nology of the time. Their raw Glastonbury 
performance almost recaptures their punk 
influences of bands like The Clash and sheds 
any image of a sappy pop-techno group.

. Investing 
in the 
Future 

The Greek system at UCSD, 
and nationally has been looked 
upon as one the top leadership de-
velopment programs. 85% of the 
US legislature is Greek. and only 
two U.S. Presidents since the in-
ce ption of social colleg iate 
fraternites has been non greek. 
Being home to 10% of the UCSD 
campu and 2 out of the last 3 
ASUCSD presidents. the Inter-
Fraternity Coucil (IFC). and 
Panhellenic of UCSD take quite 
a bit of pride in their growing 
leadershi p development pro-
gram . This past Saturday, Octo-

ence "EXCEL," the UCSD IFC

Sorority Fraternity 
The mention of rush brings vision of thin. gorgeaus girls talking about 

who are the coolest "frat" boys. and where are thc best parties .. The stereo· 
type extends into the clas ic image of a sorority girl. who calls the nerdy guys 
in ther classes to get their homework , starves herself to pass the "fat drcli 
te t," and primp for two hours before class. For the 
two hundred and eighty·eight girls that rushed this 
pasl fall. the e misconceptions were soon blown 
away. The e girls learned that sorortities are a way 
to make a big campus feel like home and to make 
friends you 've been waiting your whole life for. 

This year rush brought in a record number 
of girls. SurpriSingly a large portion of this 
record-breaking crowd were econd. 
third and even a few fourth years. 
The overwhelmmg amount of con-
tinuing students shows that these girls 
were looking for more out of their college ex pe ri-
cnce. Contrary to some b~liefs . the most common rea· 

~on . fo r rushing were not to party or meet boys. but rather 
to make closer friends and to be actively involved In an 
orgaOlZatlOI; that offers leadership roles. volunteer opportu-
nities and athletic competitions. 

Rather than rushlIlg a particular house, girls Visi t 
ea h of the eight houses at least once and as the 
four OIghts go on they narrow down their choices. 
Each of the four nights gives girls a glimpse of 
sorority life ranging from pirited slide hows, 
to philanthropy. to a more serious fi nal night 
which places an emphasis on the life-long 
friendships one makes. New member Biviana 
Barajas says, "Through each night of rush, as I learn more about each house, 
it became clear where I fe lt most comfortable." In the whirlwind of rush it is 
sometimes hard to decide where one feels most comfortable and the deci-
sions seem nerve-wracking: However. as Senior Mehan Propp says, "Rush 
has an amazing way of working OUI. Everyone ends up in the best house for 
them!" 

Rush is an amazing way to meet not only the gi rls in the particular soror-
ity you choose, but also to meet gi rl s from all aspects of the greek life. In one 
night of rush, one could meet intercollegiate athletes, AS council members. 
interns from The White House, returnees from abroad, or even that quiet girl 
in your math lecture. The point is that sororities are not only for the stereo-
typical girl. They are for any girl who wants the strength. friendship and sup-
port of a group that extends all over the nation. And who doesn ' t need that? 

Sigma Nu 's "Sandblast," benefiting the Boys and Girls Club. has been in-
tended to provide a lasting memory to all those that share in the festivities. 
The UCSD chapter of Sigma Nu has been a sponsor of the Clairemont branch 
of the Boys and Girls Club for nearly seven years. Past contributions include 
financial donations to pay for improvement of the buildings at the club and 
donations of man-hours in the form of tutoring progranns for the children. 
"Sandblast" is the latest venture with the club in an effort to provide continu-
ingsupport for their cause. The day 
of the event provides an avenue for S D S 
the chi ldren to partici.~t~ ~n v~i- AN B LA T 
ous games and actiVIties With 
members of our fraternity and 
members of other UCSD organizations. All proceeds generated are directly 
transferred to the Boys and Girls Club. 

Children are the main focus of "Sandblast." To ensure that children have a 
"blast" out on the beach, Sigma Nu has organized a varlety of events that team 
the children up with another organization in spirited competition. The com-
petitive events range from a waterballoon toss to a sand SCUlpting event. and 
even a friendly volleyball toumament. The events are designed to minimize 
competition and maximize interaction between ourselves and the children. 

The driving force behind "Sandblast" is to use the manpower of Sigma 
Nu in such a manner that the local community can benefit from it. This phi-

lanthropy is a modest attempt by our chapter to bring 
together the memben of the Greek system at the UCSD 
and the community in which we live. Throuah this event 
we wish to show the community that we all can inhabit 
these cities and benefit from each other's divenity. Hard 
work, and our love for the community helps us improve 
San Diego, the place we all like 10 call "home." 

As a timid freshman last'year, I remember approaching all of the booths on 
Library walk and having no idea 'what any of the odd letter on any of the 
displays meant. I talked to a few chapters and because I was new the school. 

had no preconceptions of whi h chapters had which 
reputations. I wanted to see what. if any thing, they 
had to offer me. I was a rush chair's dream: an 
eager freshman ready to pleadge my allegiance to 

what I saw as the best chapter on campus. Fall 
rush is the most important part of the Greek 

year. It is the primary way for chapters to 
fi nd those men who will carry on the tradi· 
tions and values of the fratemJly and the 
best way to advertise for individual chap· 
ters as well as the Greek system as a whole. 
Fa ll rush is always important. bu t this year. 

perhaps it was more signi ficant than any other 
year. The total number of pledges of the fraterni ties 
recognized by IFC was higher this year than III reo 

cent times and the Greek presence on campus was fur· 
ther increased by the record number of females who fushed 
this Fall. ConSidering that the Greek population accounts 
for only 10% of the total school population. It IS Impor· 
t3!'t for the Greek system to show what it has to ofTer 
to the entire school. 

Pi Kappa Alpha attracted the largest pledge class 
with 18 lotal pledges. "Rush IS our opportuni ty to 
show perspective members that we have a lotto ofl'er 
in terms of academi s and extra curricular activities. 

In that one week, we fi nd young mcn who will carry 
on the tradition of the fraternity we work so hard for. " 

Tau Kappa Epsilon has a different fl."111at for their rush and pledge period. 
They offer continuous open bidding. l'hey had four pledges at the end of rush 
week, but will continue to accept pledges given that they can. "Carry on the 
future of the fraternity." President Christian Chivardi continued to say that 
he looks for, "A core group of guys that can take on responsibility." 

Sigma Chi President, SCOll Richardson. was very pleased with the turnout 
this year. "Rush is getting bigger every year. I was happy to see so many 
people out. " Richardson also pointed out that pleadges provide, "New blood 
and new ideas." 

Rush is not solely inportant because it provides the Greek system with 
new members, but more importantly it allows the campus to see the opportu· 
nities that the Greek system has to offer. 

DU: The New Fraternity 
o·n Campus 

The Delta Upsilon (DU) International Fraternity will be the newest frater· 
nity on campus during tbe 2000-200 I academic year. The DU staff began 
the initial expansion project duing late April , but is currently in full swing. 

In relation to other fraternities. Delta Upsilon differs in a major way 
because it is non-secret. Since it's founding in 1834. the fraternity has made 
public the deals and principles that guide it's e~istence: the Promotion of 
Friendship, the Development of Character, the Diffusion of Liberal Culture, 
and the Advancement of Justice. Unlike other fraternities. Delta Upsilon 
informs new members about everything they and their parents would like to 
know about the organiu,tion. This includes a new member's pledge activi-
ties. initiation rites. and' what will be expected of them as a member: The 
Fraternity's initiation and ritual is a very special occasion. While most fra-
ternities perform their rites of initia-
tion behind closed doors. we encour-
age pledges to invite their parents, 
friends. University officials, and

Wallflowers: 
Group returns to San 
Diego with a new album 
c-thwed from ..... 
presence. 

Toward the height of The Wall-
flowers' success with "Bringing 
Down The Horse: Dylan also 
began to see flaws within his song-
writing as metaphors and imagery, 
especially in "One Headlight: 
which fl ew right over the heads of 
fans. 

So after the grueling tours 
wrapped up, Dylan did what every 
"serious musician" dealing with the 
harsh reality of fame does. He took 
a vacation and retreated to his 
home in Los Angeles to spend time 
with his wife and two children. 
Dylan's third child was born in 
September. 

To write the songs for The 
Wallflowers' new album "Breach," 
Dylan rented a house in. Los 
Angeles that he converted into a 
studio, put in eight hours a clay of 
undisturbed creativity and found 
inspiration in the most dreaded 
place: -his own life. Still, there are 
no songs titled "My Father the 
Icon" or "Dad Wrote 'Blowin ' in 
the wind'" on this album, but 
Dylan is definitely more comfort-
able penning lyrics that address 
his rock ' n' roll lineage. Songs like 

"Hand Me Down" and "I've Been 
Delivered" are obviously about 
feeling overshadowed and unap-
preciated. 

, One can only imagine to whom 
Dylan might have been referring. 
The songs on "Breach" are lyrically 
abstract enough to taunt rock crit-
ics drooling for the slightest Bob 
reference. 

However, it is unlikely that any 
of the fans that attend tonight's 
concert care much about Dylan 's 
illustrious father. Fans will turn 
out because The Wallflowers are 
simply a good band. The songs 
are catchy, and, at the risk of 
sounding completely shallow and 
superficial, Dylan is not too bad 
to look at; even if he is married 
with three kids. In past shows, 
Dylan evoked Beatle-esque 
screams from adoring female fans. 
Now in his thirties, it will be 
interesting (0 see if his fans have 
grown up as well. 

It will also be interesting to see 
if Dylan's new lyrical honesty will 
translate into his stage persona. In 
front of a college crowd is where 
The Wallflowers should' feel most 
at ease. From the beginning it has 
been younger fans that have actu-
ally given The Wallflowers a fair 
shot. 

Even though Dylan sounds 
more like Bruce Springsteen than 
Bob Dylan and draws inspiration 
from acts like The Clash and Paul 

The Hiatus Calendar 

The UCSD Guardian 

Westerberg, early concert reviews 
repeatedly compared The Wall-
flowers ' songs to Bob Dylan songs. 
One RoUing Stone review of a San 
Francisco show in 1997 even said 
"'6th Avenue Heartache' sounded 
like an update of 'Like a Rolling 
Stone'" 

S'o The Wallflowers might be 
the first rock band that would 
rather talk to Carson Daly on 
"Total Req uest Live" than Rolling 
Stone magazine. Bassist Richling 
told David Fricke for the October 
issue, "It's nice to be in a position 
where it's about our group, our 
music." Even if that means play-
ing to audiences that have never 
heard "The Times They are a-
Changin '." 

However, the audience at 
tonight's USD concert will have 
most likely heard "Like a Rolling 
Stone: "Blowin,' in the Wind: "Mr. 
Tambourine Man" and "The Times 
They are a-Changin'." There is 
enough room in rock for two 
Dylans, and there is room in San 
Diego for just about any rock band 
that wants to play because God 
only knows what else there is to do 
around here. Tonight'S show will 
kick off what may be the first leg of 
a North American tour. 

Doors open at 8 p.m. with 
opening act Everlast followed by 
The Wallnowers.

out th is concert. Hey, if you're 

New Order: 
Live album shows the raw 
energy of New Order 
ContInued frOIII ..... 11 
tar with such ferocity you almost for-
get about the clean studio tracks that 
we have gotten used to. 

Raw intensity and powerful 
vocals lead the group past missed 
chord changes, flubbed lyrics and the 
general insecurity of a group coping 
with something it has always been 
uncomfortable with: success. 

"Touched by the Hand of God" 
opens the album and sets the tone as 
Sumner wails and yelps throughout 
the song. "Temptation" is played at 
an amphetamine pace a~ Sumner 
cries out, "up, down, tum around. 
Please don't let me hit the ground." 

This performance reveals a band 
that is on the verge of success. As 
they introduce their "new" song 
"True Faith; you can hear an early 
version of what was to become a 
massive international hit. -You can 
also feel the \I\Ilnerability of Sumner 
as he . stumbles through the verse 
before he comes back with a rousing 
chorus. 

You can only imagine the frenzied 
dancing of the crowd as the first few

interested in playing music you 
should consider joining this class. 

This is a chance to see great 
performance that is also cheap and 
close to home. The concert is in 
Mandeville Recital Hall, costs $3 
for students and starts at 8 p.m. 
Come hear for yourself what some 
of your schoolmates study. 

bass notes are plucked out on 
"Bizarre Love Triangle." Sumner 
growls through the words of the 
song as the now classic synths build 
upon each other to climax at a glori-
ous finish. Amidst the cheers of the 
crowd you can-hear a self-conscious 
Sumner tell the crowd, "notice that 
all our songs finish with bi&. endings. 
Big songs, small dicks: 

The nostalgia of "Perfect Kiss" 
beautifully melts. into grinding gui-
tars and an angry and distorted solo. 
"Age of Consent" follows wi th more 
thick guitars doused with chorus 
effects and the passionate vocals of 
Sumner, who yells, "I'm not the kind 
that needs to tell you just what the 
fuck you want me to." 

A guitar-heavy cover of Lou 
Reed's "Sister Ray" at the end of the 
show seems to cry out that New 
Order still remembers Ian Curtis and 
their previous band, Joy Division. 

New Order's performance on this 
album is not polished nor is it 
cleaned up in the studio. This will 
not be best performance that you will 
hear from New Order. There are 
other New Order albums you should 
probably get before this one. But th is 
performance on a summer evening 
at Glastonbury in 1987 is what 
defines the attitude and energy of the 
enigmatic New Order.

Miller: 
A Bush presideru)1 would 
fit in will with sports land 

~"''''' __ 20 
and prescription drugs show, he is 
not interested in equal footing for 
anyone. Let us see the rich get rich-
er like the New York Yankees, the 
Cleveland Indians and the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, and the poor 
become poorer, like the Milwaukee 
Brewers, the Kansas City Royals 
and the Minnesota Twins. Sounds 
like a good plan to me! 

Baseball has had more fights 
than usual over the last couple of 
years, and Frank Robinson has 
been doling out punishments like a 
madman. 

With Bush's recor~ on crime-
he has presided over more than 
130 executions during his time in' 
office - it looks like Robinson 
will not only be able to suspend 
practically the entire Dodgers 
team for the season as he did last 
year, but he will have a new 
weapon ar his disposal: death. 
That's OK, however; America 
needs' less stuck-up primadonnas 
like Albert Belle. 

What about basketball? 
Players- such as Allen Iverson , 
Shaquille O'Neal and Rick Fox 
are becoming multidimensional 
on and off the coun. They are 
reaching across boundary lines to 
become basketball, movie and rap 
stars. 

[f Bush and the Republican 
Congress have anything to say 
about this kind of faceted 
approach to life, these guys will be 
in trouble. This kind of coopa-a- • 
tion between different sects of 
society is just unacceptable. 
Bipartisan mannerisms can only be 
given lip service, and not actually 
followed through. 

Whar about the · traditionally 
marginalized sports, those that 
exist on the fringes of our 
American sporting conscience: 
sports like soccer, cross country 
and diving. These are sports that 
many people play, but they bring 
in much less money than baseball 
and basketball. The majority of 
Americans rare ly th ink about 
them. 

Considering that Bush wants 
to help only "real Americans" _ 
he has published a 16-page pam-
phlet called "Real People, Real 
Americans: The Middle Class" -
and sports like cross country 
don't seem like "real" American 
sports, it looks like rhese margin-
alized, neglected aspects of the 
sporting world are going [0 be in 
for four more years of being swept 
under the table. They will be 
allowed to come out occasionally, 
for rhings like the World Cup and 
for a couple of TV appearances 
every once in a while, but most of 
the time they will be locked up in 
the closet. 

Football is the only spon that 
will be safe under a Bush presiden-
cy. Ir is just a bunch of big guys 
running around and hitting each 
other. Bush should be comfortable 
with this. 

Considering his inability to say 
what he actually means, and his 
numerous verbal blunders, Bush 
will get along just fine with all the 
concussion-ridden NFL quarter-
baclc.s and players. As one USA 
Today reporter said, "(Bush'sl ver· 
bal gaffes are so numerous they 
are not even worth reporting any 
more. W Just six days ago, he said 
social security is M not a govern-

mentp~m.w 
That IS how I see the sports 

world with Bush as president. A 
rather interesting place, don'r you 
think? 

I can sec Papa Bush and Dubya 
in the governor's mansion in 
Austin right now talking about the 
next four years. and [ bet that Papa 
has just one question for Junior: 
·Son, are you going to be pitching 
or catching?· 

Good luck to George Jr. and the 
sports world in general.

To Change 
With Election 

TAIT MILLER 

I n 1989, George W. Bu~h became a vested owner in the Texas Rangers. With his run 
for governor, his interest in the 
team waned, and in 1998 he sold 
his part of the club for a $15 mil-
lion profit. During his time as an 
owner of the Rangers he had some 
successes, a few winning seasons 
and some failures, such as the trade 
of Sammy Sosa. . 

Given Bush 's long-standing 
association with the sports world 
- he played baseball as a fresh-
man at Yale and is an avid runner 
- I think the question must be 
posed: What will his probable 
presidency mean for American 
sports? 

In baseball, there will be no 
salary cap. It seems as if a cap 
would run against this 
Republican's principles of letting 
the economics dictate what hap-
pens. . 

What does a cap do except put 
teams on equal footing? As Bush's 
plans for social security, tax cuts

Soccer Teams 
Announced 
McManus leads a 
number of Tritons on 
the all-league squad 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

UCSD women's soccer head 
coach Brian McManus was named 
the California Collegiate Athletic; 
Conference Coach of the Year. 

In their first year at the Division 
II level and their 14th under the 
guidance of McManus, the Tritons 
sported a regular season record of 
15-2 and captured the CCAA 
crown with a 1-0 victory over 
Sonoma State on Saturday. 

"When you have good players, 
they get you the trophy," McManus 
said. "If you have good players, 
you're not going to get any wins; 
you're not going to get anything. It 
splits \:p into 25 even partS." 

The Thtons placed two mem-
bers on the AII -CCAA First Team, 
with senior Cindy Oostalek taking 
a forward position and junior Julia 
Cuder at a defensive spot. Junior 
forward Erika Alfredson made the 
AII-CCAA Second Team. 

The men's side was also hon-
ored. 

Junior midfielder Bobby Saadati 
made the AII-CCAA First Team, and 
senior midfielder Brady Bernard 
earned an honorable mention. 

The women's soccer team wilL . 
gear up to host Sonoma State in 
the first round of the NCAA 
Oivision " Championship on 
Saturday at 6 p,m.

PORTS 
Volleyball Splits Two More 
Tritons lose a heartbreaker, take it out on Dominguez Hills 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

Home is where the heart is; the 
old adag'e was again proven true by 
the UCSO women's volleyball 
team last weekend at our very own 
RIMAC Arena. There has not been 
a better exhibition of that throb-
bing, blood-engorged organ in a 
long, long time. 

Cal State Los Angeles blew into 
town, unbeaten and unbowed, 
looking to add another convincing 
win to its already sterling first-
place record. 

The Tritons, Itowevj.:r, were 
more than ~p for the challenge that 
these big city bailers were offering 
and stolidly took the court Friday 
night primed and ready to face the 
one team that stood above them in 
their division of the California 
Collegiate Athletic Conference. 

The first set was an even-
handed affair, with the teams 
going back and forth at the net. 
The ball fell a few more times for 
CSULA, however, and they took 
the set 15-11 . UCSD used this 
first set let-down to motivate, and 
came blasting back with authori-
ty to win the secon,d and third 
sets, 15-6 and 15-4, respectively. 
Now holding the 2-1 set lead in 
the match, the Tritons needed 
just one more game win to seal 
the victory and break CSULA's 
season-long unbeaten streak. 

The Golden Eagles had other 
ideas, though, and handily took 
the fourth set 15-9. The fifth and 
final set was excruciating for both 
sides. It was the first time CSULA 
had been taken to five sets all sea-
son and they looked uneasy at the 
prospect of failure, while the 
Tritons were tense, not wanting 
to let their early lead slip away. 
Points fell for both sides, and the 

pressure mounted as the set pro-
gressed. In the end it was the 
Eagles, however, who had the lit-
tle bit of extra effort to put the 
game away 15-12 and take the 
match, keeping their unbeaten 
streak intact. 

According to senior setter 
Christine Kueneman, a victory for 
the Tritons against CSULA is very 
feasible. 

"We played them very well on 
Friday night, we just needed to do 
a few more things to get the win," 
Kueneman said. "We know we can 
beat them if we JUSt do those few 
things and play to our potential." 

The Tritons were led by the 
play of Laura Santerre, who once 
again had a solid night, compiling 
18 kills and 10 digs. Kueneman 
also had an impressive showing 
against the tough opposition, pick-
ing up 36 assists and 19 digs. 

Meagan Bergeson led the 
Golden Eagle attack with 16 kills, 
whi le teammates Jamie Griffin, 
Linda Saucedo and Dana Coffey 
had each notched 15 kills. Kristy 
Sain was a huge asset as well, con-
tributing 53 assists on the night. 

The victory improves the 
Golden Eagles record to 19-0 in 
CCAA play and 27-0 overall. 

Saturday night was designated 
senior night at RIMAC Arena, and 
in addition to honoring Leslie 
Punelli, Kueneman, Kearney Visser 
and Shannon Hawes, the Tritons 
celebrated by stomping Cal State 
Dominguez Hills 3-1 in CCAA play. 

The Tritons took the first set 
easily, with 15-4 tally before 
momentarily losing focus and 
dropping the second 10-15. From 
there on out the Tritons kept their 
eyes on the prize and picked up set 
ttfree 15-5, and held to take the 
fourth 17-15 to score the ch<:ck in 
the win column.

Kitchen Cooking for UCSD Cross Country Squad 
Triton star Amy Kitchen has overcome many hurdlers to compete on this year's squad 
By J!SSICA KRUIKAMP 
Staff Writer 

Senior Amy Kitchen runs to 
race and races to win. 

Consistently running for the . 
cross country A team, Kitchen has 
repeatedly placed in the top five 
spots throughout the season. 
Running the 5,OOO-kilometer and 
1 O,OOO-kilometer races, this ecolo-
gy, behavior and evolution major 
also knows what it is like to be out 
of the race. 

Kitchen was sidelined for a year 
and a half with three stress frac-

tures to her leg, which were sus-
tained while running track during 
her sophomore year. In her 
returning season of cross country, 
as she was getting her running 
legs back, she received a knee 
injury and had to watch races 
rather than compete in them. 

"She is tough as nails: said 
head coach Ted Van Arsdale. "This 
season is a tremendous comeback 
for her after the year-and-a-half 
rehabilitation that she went 
through." 

Kitchen wanted to get back on 
the track as soon as possible. 

"It is really hard to be injured 
for that long and to not be able to 
compete: Kitchen said: "I really 
enjoy the racing aspect of the 
sport, and not just the running, 
and I could not wait to get back 
out there." 

According to Van ArsdaIe, 
every runner rea~hes a point 
where she questions herself as a 
runner and her motivation for 
continuing to run. A runner 
endures times of reflection and 
thought about her future in the 
sport. O'uring Kitchen's time of 
questioning, Van Arsdale feels that 

she realized many things. 
"I think that she knew she had 

it in herself to make a $reat come-
back: Van Arsdale saId. "There 
was more to her career that she 
had done by then. There was more 
for her to accomplish before she 
was satisfied, so she directed her 
energies into getting back on the 
track for the team." 

Kitchen learned a lot about 
herself as an athlete while side-
lined with injuries. Although she 
cares about the UCSO team, run-
