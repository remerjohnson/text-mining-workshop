You picked a school by the 
beach — don’t go four years with-
out taking a beach day.  Even if you 
hate getting sand, well, everywhere, 
you can engage your outdoorsy side 
and see one of the coolest parts of 
the neighborhood by spending a 
morning kayaking at La Jolla Cove. 

Several rental outlets line a 
beachfront street several miles 
south of campus where prices are 
reasonable but vary depending on 
boat size and how long you plan to 
be out there. 

A one-hour rental for a double 
can set you back around $50, but 
you can save big by cashing in on 
special deals (do your homework 
and book early!). The kayaking 
area is home to a variety of marine 
life including seals, garibaldi fish 
and leopard sharks. Enjoy your 
surroundings, because after all, La 
Jolla Cove is part of the second-
largest protected marine area in 
California. Bring your camera — a 
waterproof one.

Kayakers can go it alone or in a 
group, but you’ll need to go with a 
guide if you want to paddle into the 
caves. At least three kayak rental 
outlets can be found on Avenida De 
La Playa between Camino Del Sol 
and El Paseo Grande including La 
Jolla Kayak and San Diego Bike and 
Kayak.

KAYAKING
BY ZEV  HURWITZ  NEWS EDITOR

LA JOLLA

It’s in tourist brochures. It’s in lists 
of “free things to do in San Diego.” 
Most of all, it’s in the profile pictures 
of every one of your friends who has 
ever lived in “America’s finest city.”

Potato Chip Rock is a strangely 
shaped natural formation on the peak 
of Mt. Woodson. It’s a rite of passage 
for San Diegans, and those passing 
through, to hike the trail and take a 
picture posing on its seemingly precar-
ious tip (in reality, the rock is incred-
ibly stable). The trail is harder than it 
seems: Although it’s only 3.1 miles to 
the top, the trek is uphill nearly the 
entire way, with only one rocky area 
suited for taking a break. The scenery 
itself is disappointing — scrub, dust, 
more scrub — but the views of the 
city below serve as reminders of San 
Diego’s natural beauty.

Mt. Woodson is approximately 
30 minutes away by car — parking is 
about $10 per car. Depending on the 
skill set of your group, expect to spend 
about four hours climbing up and 
down, and don’t forget the water bot-
tles. Also important: When heading 
back to the parking lot, don’t take the 
trail that keeps going down. It seems 
counter-intuitive, but the last bit of the 
trail downhill goes up before reaching 
the end of the way. Most people forget 
this and wander in the opposite direc-
tion, only to realize that they’re 20 
minutes away. 

A few things are synonymous 
with San Diego, and none more 
so than SeaWorld. At its heart, 
SeaWorld presents various entertain-
ments in open-air amphitheaters and 
aquarium features where the per-
formers are killer whales, dolphins, 
otters, sea lions, orcas and seals. 
Although pirouetting dolphin shows 
are surely as famous, SeaWorld’s 
most popular show is, without 
doubt, “Believe,” which stars Shamu, 
the killer whales that have always 
been the park’s mascot. Not only is 
it a showplace for marine life, but it 
also has a collection of exciting water 
rides. On that note, a new “Manta” 
coaster that swoops, dives and twists 
in a shape of a giant manta ray has 
been just added to the list over the 
summer. SeaWorld is only about 
a 20-minute car drive away from 
campus, and UCSD students can get 
about a $10 discount for the ticket at 
the UCSD box office — so head out 
and see what all the hype is about. 

The San Diego Zoo, one of the 
world’s largest, can be a little pricey 
on a student budget, but spending 
a day among California’s largest 
collection of exotic animals is well 
worth the admission fee. The zoo 
has just welcomed baby elephants, 
a giraffe and a giant panda named 
Xiao Liwu. Besides the ever-grow-
ing zoo family, a number of holiday 
themed events, such as “Breakfast 
with Santa” make this time of year 
perfect to visit. Public transporta-
tion from campus is very difficult 
so be prepared to drive. Zoo food is 
expensive, but security is lax about 
bringing your own so make sure 
you pack a bagg lunch. Saying the 
Zoo is huge is an understatement, 
so definitely plan to spend at least 
half a day there. Tickets run at 
around $40, but discounts are avail-
able through the UCSD Box Office.

The Cerebral Palsy thrift store 
is often overlooked in favor of 
its well-known Pacific Beach 
neighbors: Buffalo Exchange 
and Goodwill. But while Buffalo 
Exchange tries to sell secondhand 
clothing at prices more expensive 
than the original, and Goodwill 
has a plethora of ugly sweaters that 
aren’t shelved in the ugly sweater 
section, the Cerebral Palsy store 
usually has decent merchandise at 
decent prices.  

The store will often have 25, 
50 or 75 percent discounts on 
the already marked-down prices, 
though the best part is the 10 per-
cent student discount with valid ID. 

There is the requisite mass-
market secondhand clothing, at 
cheaper prices than elsewhere ($5 
Charlotte Russe and Forever 21 
clothing, as opposed to original 
price at Buffalo), but the true high-
light is the rack of vintage dresses. 
Though occasionally inundated 
with one too many unwanted wed-
ding dresses, this section includes 
plenty of “Mad Men”-esque silk 
sheaths and 60s shifts. There’s also 
a solid selection of shoes (mostly 
women’s, including heels of all sizes 
and shapes) and jewelry (chunky 
costume bracelets and earrings are 
the specialty) that make it a good 
place to do Halloween shopping.

Over 3,500 students turned out to the second annual Hullabaloo festival which 
took place on Friday, Nov. 16.  
Musicians and DJs such as the M 
Machine, XV and DJ Chris Cutz 
performed at the concert at Town 
Square. 

According to Marketing and 
Media Director of A.S. Concerts and 
Events Frederic Klein, since there is 
no official count, attendance rates are 
based on the number of wristbands 
distributed. This shows an increase 

from last year’s over 3,000-student 
participation in the festival’s first 
year.

Hullabaloo marks the culmina-
tion of Founders Day and included a 
daytime event welcoming Chancellor 
Pradeep Khosla and a nighttime car-
nival with music, rides and student 
organization booths.

ASCE had the same $62,500 
budget as last year allocated by 
A.S. Council. An extra $2,500 was 
obtained through sponsorship 
that ASCE has pursued since May 

from sources  such as the UCSD 
Bookstore, University Centers and 
Founders’ Celebration.

This year, Hullabaloo centered on 
UCSD’s Founders Day by branding 
the number “8” on posters around 
campus to represent the introduction 
of UCSD’s eighth chancellor, Pradeep 
Khosla. The tagline for Founders 
Day was “We Inspire,” which was 
integrated through the promotion 
of student organizations in booths

The-Dine-with-a-Professor pro-
gram will continue despite A.S. 
Council budget cuts. Each indi-
vidual college will still sponsor the 
program, which allows students to 
get to know their professors over a 
meal for free.

A.S. Council Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Bryan 
Cassella said that council dropped 
Dine-with-a-Professor funding in 
its Fall 2012 budget because the 
program was not used to the satis-
faction of A.S. Council.

“We found that the program was 

not utilized very much and also 
coincided with pre-existing pro-
grams on each of the college cam-
puses that are much more success-
ful,” he said. 

Muir College Council Chair Kit 
Wong explained that council origi-
nally funded the program to expand 
it, giving students more opportuni-
ties to participate. With A.S. fund-
ing, students could dine with pro-
fessors through A.S. Council instead 
of just through their respective col-
leges.

According to Warren Dean of 
Student Affairs Paul DeWine, who 
oversees the program for Warren 
College, because the colleges man-
age the Dine-with-a-Professor pro-
gram, the loss of funding from A.S. 
Council will have no impact on how 
the program operates.   While the

Twenty-four UCSD graduate stu-
dents in the School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies will 
receive full scholarships over the 
next four years from the Robertson 
Foundation for Government, a pri-
vate family foundation that supports 
education for those pursuing careers 
in government. The foundation has 
donated $950,000 in scholarship 
funds for students, who are chosen 
from the pool of those admitted into 
IR/PS.

The Robertson Foundation ini-
tially pledged $450,000 in 2010, then  
pledged an additional $500,000 in 
late October of this year. 

IR/PS Career Consultant Tamara 

Golden, who works directly with 
Robertson Fellows on campus, says 
that the Robertson Foundation 
decided to pledge additional money 
because its initial donation saw 
such positive results. The founda-
tion began pledging money to five 
schools, including UCSD, in 2010, 
and decided to continue to pledge 
more money after developing a close 
relationship with each school.

“I like to think we lead the way 
among those five schools in dem-
onstrating outstanding stewardship 
and realizing their mission in fund-
ing these students,” Golden said.

Golden also explained that the 
Robertson Foundation felt that IRPS 
was making sound decisions in the

UC Irvine became the first UC 
school to pass a divestment reso-
lution, urging its campus to stop 
investing in companies profiting 
from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

The resolution was unanimously 
passed Nov. 13 by the Associated 
Students of UCI, with 16 votes in 
favor and zero oppositions. The stu-
dent representatives proposed the 
withdrawal of investment funds from 
companies manufacturing weapons 
used by the Israeli military, such as 
Hewlett Packard, Caterpillar, General 
Electric Company and Raytheon. 

“I believe the council is very open 
to hearing about companies to divest 
from that violate human rights,” A.S. 
President of UCI Traci Ishigo wrote 
in an email. 

The council wrote the resolution 
in response to the 2005 Palestinian 
civil society call for boycott, divest-
ment and sanctions (BDS) against 
Israel. BDS is a strategy to get Israel 
to comply with international law and 
Palestinian rights. BDS has become 
a global movement against Israeli 
apartheid as a result. 

UCI Legislation posted a press 
release Nov. 13 announcing its reso-
lution to divest from companies that 
profit from apartheid. 

“I am very proud of my fellow 
council members and of the stu-
dents at our University,” UCI Student 
Representative of Legislation Sabreen 
Shalabi said, in the press release. 

Last March, UCSD voted down 
a similar resolution attempt, pro-
posed by the Students for Justice in 
Palestine. SJP proposed divestment 
resolutions in 2010 and 2011 as well. 

In May 2010, UC Berkeley turned 
down a similar resolution urging the 
UC system to divest from General 
Electric and United Technologies, 
two American companies that pro-
duced aircraft for Israel’s army. The 
student senate passed the resolution 
and was later vetoed by then-A.S. 
President Will Smelko.

UC Regents Russell Gould, 
Sherry Lansing, and Mark Yudof 
responded to the Berkeley events 
with a “Statement on Divestment,”

The CSU Board of Trustees wants to implement “punishment fees” for students who don’t graduate within four years. As a response, students at California State Universities recently 
banded together to prevent the proposal, and convinced the CSU 
Board of Trustees to postpone their plan to gather more information. 
While there has been an increasing number of students who remain 
at CSUs beyond the traditional four years, this proposal is unfair as it 
adds an unnecessary financial burden to students who are unable —
not unwilling— to obtain the classes they need to graduate.

The “punishment fees” consist of three different fees to “motivate” 
students to graduate in a timely manner: a $372 per-unit supplement 
for students who have already met the required number of units to 
graduate, a $91 per-unit fee for students planning to redo a class, and 
a $182 per-unit fee for students planning to take more than 18 units 
per grading period. Implementing these fees insinuates that students 
procrastinate on finishing their degrees. However, a survey conducted 
by the CSU Students for Equality Education group shows that 50 
percent of students are unable to get the classes they need to graduate, 
forcing them to take on additional quarters to fulfill their requirements.

Fitting students into classes is challenging given enrollment 
increases of 75,000 more students across the CSU system than there 
were in 1997. This makes it difficult to obtain all required classes, 
especially with courses only offered during certain quarters or 
semesters. With students vying for that specific Winter Quarter class, 

it is no wonder that 65.1 percent of students graduate in six years at 
public four-year universities in California, according to a study done by 
The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2010. However, a student should 
not be punished for being unable to stay on track with graduation 
when they’re incapable of getting the necessary classes needed to finish 
their major.

CSU officials also hope to stop the number of students retaking 
classes. The SQE survey shows that 55 percent of students have had to 
retake a course. However, a potential solution is instigating a lower cap 
on the number of courses a student is allowed to retake. Most CSUs 
have a limit of 16 units per year, but by implementing two retakes per 
year for different classes, more students will be able to get their desired 
classes. This allows students to stay on track with graduation and can 
also help reduce student debt, as students would not be required to 
take on additional quarters. 

Rising student debt is a major reason why these fees should not be 
executed. According to FinAid, a leading source of student financial aid 
information, nationwide student debt has reached over $1 trillion. The 
SQE survey shows that 68 percent of students stated that they would be 
required to take on more loans if the fees were implemented. As debts 
increase, students are more tempted to drop out of college. A survey 
by Duck9, a website dedicated to providing students information on 
staying out of debt,  shows that the main reason for leaving college is 

Too Little, Too Late

Two Thanksgivings ago, while most students were at home diving into freshly-roasted 
turkeys and swapping stories with 
their families, I found myself staring 
across a restaurant table at two 
complete strangers I had just met at 
a bus stop. We didn’t even entirely 
speak the same language.

For the third year in a row, I will 
not be going home for the four-day 
weekend. Thanksgiving was never a 
major occasion in my family, airfare 
is costly and in any case, I will be 
flying home for the winter holidays in 
just a few short weeks. My roommate, 
fortunately for me, is in the same 
situation. Although I’m kitchen-
illiterate and don’t have a car, I like to 
ensure that Thanksgiving away from 
home does not consist of pitifully 
downing instant noodles by the box.

During the first Thanksgiving 
I spent away from home, my 
roommate and I made the precarious 
decision to accept two strangers’ 
solicitations to join them for dinner. 
They looked harmless enough — they 
met the minimum requirement of not 
being unshaven, rag-wearing vagrants 
—  so we shrugged and readily 
agreed. After all, spontaneity had 
hardly ever disappointed us in the 
past and we were happy to add more 
people to our lonely pairing. These 
strangers decided to follow us in 
going out for hot pot, an East Asian 
type of meal in which thinly sliced 
meat and vegetables are simmered in 
a communal pot of broth. It had been 
initially disheartening that we had 
planned on going out for a family-
style dinner on a cold autumn’s night 
with just the two of us, but we had 
been adamant that we not resort to 
purchasing frozen bastardizations of 
mashed potatoes and turkey stuffing. 

Luckily enough, these strangers 
did not fulfill the criteria for the 
population that usually lingers 
around bus stops — people you 
take extra pains to avoid eye contact 
with. My conversations with them 
primarily consisted of nodding and 
making hand gestures, but I was 
able to comprehend that they were 
international students attending 
SDSU, and that they were both much 
older than I was. One was in her 
early thirties and already had a family 
back in Beijing. Our dinner together 
consisted of awkward “family” 
photos and comically uncomfortable 
miscommunications, but I had a far 
more interesting experience than I 
would have had if I had gone home. 
I left the dinner not knowing their 
names and with the memory of their 
faces already fading away — but 
that’s the best part of it. I still have a 
sticky note with their email addresses 
tucked away somewhere.

While I disappointingly did not 
violate the rules of  avoiding “stranger 
danger” again last year, I wouldn’t 
hesitate to do a repeat experience. 
The moral of the story: If you can’t 
spend time with your family over the 
holidays, don’t settle for sad, make a 
couple friends and just create your 
own fun.

The number of sexual images popping 
up on porn websites without owner consent 
is a growing cause of concern for younger 
individuals. Since placing restrictions on sharing 
photographs and videos is an invasion of privacy, 
more secure avenues for sharing personal images 
should be made accessible to the youth.

One popular smartphone application that 
helps protect individuals’ privacy is Snapchat, 
launched in September of last year. The app 
allows users to send photos via text, but the 
recipient can only view the photos for one to 10 
seconds, after which the picture is deleted from 
both phones. Furthermore, the app makes it 
harder to take screenshots by requiring users to 
hold their fingers on the screen to view received 
photos. But if a screenshot is taken, the owner of 
the original photo is notified.

Restrictions on other popular social media 
avenues would help protect privacy. Since many 
sexual photos are stolen from personal blogs and 
image hosting sites such as Tumblr and Flickr, 
users should disable the right-click function on 
these sites to deter others from saving pictures to 
their hard drives.  

No application can completely eliminate the 
risk of the unintentional spread of sexual photos 
and videos; however, extra precautions can 
create a much needed, extra barrier of protection 
between these private materials and porn 
websites.

The CSU system is considering a plan to encourage four-year graduation by charging fees for any

The questions surrounding the legal 
regulation of sexually explicit images raise issues 
about the role of government. The government 
needs to address these issues, because simply 
raising awareness about the dangers of posting 
nude pictures on the Internet among young 
people is not effective enough.

Lack of federal regulation over sexually 
explicit material is usually defended under the 
First Amendment’s freedom of speech. But 
there are websites, which the Internet Watch 
Foundation terms “parasites,” that advertise 
themselves as “homemade stolen teen porn.” 
There needs to be more public pressure on the 
federal government to work harder to identify 
and shut down the servers of theses “parasites,” as 
they do in cases of child pornography, especially 
considering that much of the stolen material 
depicts minors. The PROTECT Act, which 
criminalizes knowingly receiving or distributing 
a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually 
explicit conduct, should be extended to the 
distribution of personal explicit images.

Currently, individuals must look to private 
companies such as  the “Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act Takedown Service” that work 
to get material removed through the United 
States Copyright Office. The current absence 
and inefficiency of federal efforts to prevent 
and identify the publishing of stolen images and 
videos urgently needs to be addressed.

Government Needs to Address the Issue
An alarming percentage of sexual media 

are stolen by “parasite” websites that glean their 
content from lost or stolen cellphones, hacked 
social networks and blogging platforms. The most 
effective solution to illegal image harvesting is to 
take a preventative approach and inform youth 
about the realities of internet “privacy.”

The Internet Watch Foundation explained that 
it is difficult to remove uploaded images because 
they get copied and distributed throughout the net. 
On Facebook, it takes 30 days to remove a picture 
from the servers once a user has deleted it, which 
is a substantial window of time for these images to 
be found and stolen by parasite websites such as 
the notorious “XVideos.” Facebook should make 
this clearer to users by including a warning before 
uploading a photo or, at the very least, including 
this information in its Help section.  

Schools should also be required to alert youth 
of the risks of their actions online. The Guttmacher 
Institute, a non-profit organization advocating 
reproductive health, reports that a large majority 
of U.S. public schools (96 percent in California) 
host “Sex Ed.” classes. Warnings about sexual 
exploitation on the Web should be included in 
these classes because parasite websites pose serious 
threats to students’ rights and well-being. 

The Internet is not a private medium and 
should not be treated as such. Youths must 
understand that in sending personal pictures 
online, they’re risking their privacy along with it.

financial pressure. However, the 
problem of dropouts extends farther 
than just the university. A report 
released in 2010, “The High Cost of 
Low Graduation Rates: How Much 
Does Dropping Out of College Really 
Cost?”, shows that $3.8 billion was 
lost in income and $566 million in 
federal income taxes because of one 
college class of dropouts in 2002. 
These fees proposed by the CSU 
Board of Trustees would only harm 
students, as well as the nation, in a 
time when debt has hit $15.86 trillion. 

There are solutions that address 
the student debt crisis as well 
as graduation delays, unlike the 
“punishment fee” plan. In 2013, the 

University of Texas at Austin will test 
out a new program where they will 
forgive a portion of student loans 
for students who graduate within 
four years. With less than 30 percent 
of students graduating public Texas 
universities in four years and a little 
more than 50 percent graduating 
within six years, the institution 
recognizes that graduation delays are 
becoming a large problem throughout 
the nation. However, instead of trying 
to force additional fees on students, 
they motivate them to graduate on 
time by lowering student debt. While 
CSUs may not have the resources to 
pay off portions of student loans, they 
can offer different options to students. 
They can reevaluate their general 
education requirements and adjust it 

to give students a variety of options to 
fulfill a certain requirement, lessening 
the competition for a particular class. 
Incentives do not have to be strictly 
monetary. 

Students should not be punished 
for being unable to graduate in time 
if obtaining a class is out of their 
control. With the current economic 
times, they are already struggling 
to pay tuition and more fees only 
add additional burden and debt. 
To encourage students to graduate 
within four years, the CSU Board 
of Trustees should be proposing an 
incentive that benefits rather than 
harms.

Solve FoR X By Philip Jia

Dear Editor, 
In his recent letter from Nov. 

5, professor David Feifel described 
how Hamas, the Islamic terrorist 
organization that rules Gaza, 
was recklessly risking a major 
conflagration by firing countless 
rockets into Israel’s population 
centers. He also predicted that 
Students for Justice in Palestine, 
content to be silent while Israeli 
civilians were being pounded by 
Palestinian rockets, would react 
with moral indignation if Israel took 
assertive steps to defend itself. Sadly, 
all this has come to pass.

After numerous unheeded 
warnings to Hamas to cease and 
desist, Israel launched a surgical air 
strike on Nov. 14, killing Ahmed 
Jabari, the Hamas mastermind 
who was behind the rocket attacks 
and many other attacks on Israeli 
civilians. Instead of getting the 
message, Hamas — incredibly — 
called Jabari’s elimination an “act 
of war,” (as if rockets were an act 
of friendship) and has intensified 
the rocket fire into Israel. In turn, 
Israel’s air force is targeting Gaza’s 
government enclaves, rocket 
launchers and weapons stores, which 
have been deliberately located next to 
residential buildings. Sadly, innocent 
civilians on both sides are paying the 
price for Hamas’ explicitly declared 
goal of eliminating Israel. 

Most of the democratic world 
community has expressed support 
for Israel’s action. President Obama’s 
administration has issued the 
following statement:

“There is no justification for 
the violence that Hamas and other 
terrorist organizations are employing 
against the people of Israel. We 
support Israel’s right to defend itself, 

and we encourage Israel to continue 
to take every effort to avoid civilian 
casualties. Attacking Israel on a near 
daily basis does nothing to help 
Palestinians in Gaza or to move 
the Palestinian people any closer to 
achieving self-determination.”

A spokesman for the German 
government stated, “Hamas in Gaza 
is responsible for the outbreak of 
violence… The Israeli government 
had the right and obligation to 
protect its population.” The EU’s 
foreign policy chief, Catherine 
Ashton, asserted, “The rocket attacks 
by Hamas and other factions in 
Gaza, which began this current 
crisis, are totally unacceptable for 
any government and must stop… 
Israel has the right to protect 
its population.”  UN Secretary 
General Ban Ki-moon called 
for “an immediate cessation of 
indiscriminate rocket attacks by 
Palestinian militants targeting Israel.” 

As predicted, SJP has sprung into 
action now that Israel is fighting 
back.  Its UCSD Facebook page calls 
for a vigil for Gaza, stating, “We 
call upon the community to come 
together to be in solidarity with the 
Palestinian people’s resistance to 
Israeli aggression.”  Apparently SJP, 
which touts itself as a human rights 
group, has no problem with rockets 
targeting Israeli civilians. It seems 
only to have problems with the 
Jewish nation’s efforts to defend itself.

▶ UCSD was recently voted the most 
vegan-friendly college in America 
in an annual contest sponsored by 
peta2;PETA’s youth division. There 
were 32 large schools in the com-
petition this year, including Cornell 
University, UC Berkeley and UCLA. 
The vegan restaurant Roots was the 
biggest factor in UCSD’s victory. The 
restaurant serves popular dishes such 
as the Spicy Sierra — vegan chicken 
in barbecue sauce with chipotle soy 
cream and caramelized onions — and 
the El Capitan — vegan Italian sau-
sage, dairy-free cheese and sautéed 
peppers.

▶ Five UCSD students who were for-
mer foster children and two junior 
faculty members were chosen to 
receive the latest Sony Electronics 
products. This is the fourth year that 
Sony has partnered with UCSD and 
other colleges to provide scholars 
with technology tools. The products 
include a VAIO laptop, Xperia tablet, 
PlayStation Vita and an Alpha NEX-7 
digital camera. 

▶   Janice Katz of Poway pledged 
$2 million to the Center for Pain 
Medicine at UCSD. She and her hus-
band, David Katz, sold their Chicago 
business and retired in San Diego 
when she was diagnosed with chronic 
neck and back pain. After little suc-
cess with her orthopedists, she was 
treated at the pain center, where she 
found relief after doctors injected 
some of her neck and back muscles 
with Botox. Her positive experience 
led to the couple’s decision to make a 
donation that will support the center’s 
general operations.

▶ UCSD Political Science Professor 
Samuel Popkin was revealed as 
a member of President Obama’s 
“Academic Dream Team,” a group of 
at least six unpaid academic advisers 
called the Consortium of Behavioral 
Scientists. Popkin is an expert on poll-
ing and communications and has con-
sulted previous presidents and vice 
presidents about elections, including 
Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Al 

Gore. His new book, “The Candidate,” 
described management strategies 
for political campaigns and how to 
use the power of incumbency. Mesa 
College professor Carl Luna said the 
President used many of Popkin’s strat-
egies in his re-election campaign that 
helped him win a second term.

▶   A quadriplegic rapist won his appeal 
to be released from prison due to his 
current condition. Steven Martinez 
applied to be released from prison 
under a medical parole law – cre-
ated to lower prison costs – and was 
rejected. Martinez had been the first 
prisoner in California to apply for the 
law. He appealed the rejection and an 
appeals court in San Diego supported 
him. Martinez was paralyzed instantly 
after two inmates stabbed him in the 
neck in 2001. In 1998, Martinez wa 
s convicted of driving his car over 
a woman, assaulting her, kidnapping 
her and then raping her.

the perimeter of Town Square. A 
contest was held for students to make 
a film that integrated the Hullabaloo 
tagline, and Meghan Hayes’ winning 
film was featured on large screens at 
the performance stage.

The festivities began at 11 a.m. 
with a speech from Chancellor 
Khosla, booths by UCSD academic 
communities and food trucks dis-
tributing free samples. At 8 p.m., the 
music performances began and car-
nival rides — including the Zipper, 
Paratrooper, Human Bowling and 
Bungee Run — opened.

“It’s basically a giant birthday 
party for the school,” Festival Director 
of ASCE Andrea Hsueh said. “We 

hope that students will get increased 
school pride and student unity from 
this festival.”

Philip Deleon, a freshman from 
Thurgood Marshall College, com-
pared Hullabaloo to commercial fes-
tivals like Oktoberfest and liked the 
Hullabaloo set-up.

“Having the food, booths and 
rides separate makes it really orga-
nized,” he said. “I don’t feel like 
I’m being smushed the whole time, 
though there are lots of people here.”

Brittany Rhyme, a senior in 
Thurgood Marshall College, was at 
the festival for two hours but was not 
able to experience any of the rides.

“I like that there is more stuff to 
do than just be at a concert,”Rhyme 
said. “But the rides could be better 

and the lines are too long to wait 
in. “

Food trucks such as Devilicious, 
Dog Shack and Super Q were open 
throughout the night with special $5 
student deals created especially for 
the event.

Students who got their Founders 
Day card stamped by five booths 
during the day received free light 
sticks for the concert.

“We really wanted students to 
feel more connected to campus tra-
ditions and history,” Hsueh said. 
“The student org booths were set up 
to display what students are really 
passionate about.”

spent on the program, many of the 
college councils are not worried due to 
savings left over from previous years. 
This will allow the colleges to self fund 
Dine-with-a-Professor — at least for 
the next few years. 

“Funding is going to be constricted 
a little depending on the amount of 
demand from students who want to 
do it,” Wong said. “It’ll be hard to tell 
who’ll get it and who won’t, but for 
now funding seems to be the least of 
our worries, because it’s been a strong 
and stable program regardless of A.S. 
funding.” 

Despite losing around half of the 
programs’ funding, the college coun-
cils are focusing more on expansion 
rather than cutbacks. Muir Dean of 

Student Affairs Patricia Mahaffey is 
looking forward to improving the 
program, with hopes to expand the 
Coffee-with-a-Professor program to 
cover all six colleges instead of just 
Warren and Sixth. Additionally, she 
predicted that A.S. Council’s discon-
tinuation of funding would have its 
advantages.

“I anticipate that with the discon-
tinuation of the Dine-with-a-Prof 
Program that A.S. [Council] funded 
we may see an increase in usage with-
in the college program. We welcome 
that,” she said. “Students that may have 
picked up a lunch card through the 
A.S. office will now pick up their lunch 
card from their college dean’s office.”

recipient selection process. 
“The foundation realized that we 

are taking their money seriously 
and choosing candidates wisely,” she 
said. “They wanted to put even more 
of their money, energy and effort 
into our students as a result.”

The money will cover the stu-
dents’ expenses as they pursue mas-
ter’s degrees in international rela-
tions, provided they are committed 
to serving the government for at 
least three of the five years after they 
graduate. 

Students must also apply for gov-
ernment-related jobs and intern-
ships during their second year of 
graduate school. 

“We are extremely grate-
ful for this generous gift from the 
Robertson Foundation,” IR/PS Dean 

Peter Cowhey said in an Oct. 29 
UC Newsroom press release. “With 
the foundation’s support, we can 
continue to attract exceptionally tal-
ented students to IR/PS. These stu-
dents can then go on to become the 
high-caliber professionals that are 
so critically needed in the federal 
government.”

Each year since 2010, three 
Robertson Fellows have been 
named. This year, IRPS students 
Kent Boydston, Shannon Morrison 
and Eli Yani were selected. In the 
past three years, since the Robertson 
Foundation began giving scholar-
ship money to IR/PS, all recipients 
who have graduated are now work-
ing for or seeking jobs in the U.S. 
government.

UCI Officials Say School Will Not Make Divest Any Funds

affirming their position on 
divestment. 

The statement claims that the 
Board of Regents will support  
divestment only when the United 
States government declares a foreign 
government of committing geno-
cide.  

After ASUCI passed the resolu-
tion through its executive and judi-
cial boards, the UCI administration 
released a statement claiming it are 
not divesting from Israel. 

“Such divestment is not the poli-
cy of this campus, nor is it the policy 
of the University of California,” the 
UCI administration stated. 

UCSD Tritons for Israel President 
Ben Hass believes that despite UCI 
not cutting ties, it will have an 
impact across the UC campuses.  
  “We, Tritons for Israel, really object 
to what these resolutions are say-

ing,” Hass said. “They’re targeting 
Israel specifically and we feel as if 
we are unfairly being singled out 
and attacked because we are Israeli 
and these resolutions always men-
tion some criticism to Israel.”

UCSD’s SJP commended ASUCI’s 
resolution to divest from Israel 
and is supporting of a divestment 
resolution in the UC system. The 
groupposted a press release Nov. 13 
in response to the UCI divestment 
resolution. 

 “We at UCSD SJP are hopeful to 
see the tide turn in favor of human 
rights, equality, dignity, and an end 
to systems of settler-colonialism, 
both in Palestine and across allied 
struggles,” the press release stated. 

In response to UCI’s divestment 
resolution, TFI plans to take action 
on Library Walk by telling UCSD’s 
student body why it is important 
to object divestment. By talking to 
students on Library Walk, TFI hopes 

to let students know why this resolu-
tion affects them.

“There’s been a lot going on in 
Israel right now, and just to make 
things clear, we stand in total soli-
darity with the civilians that were 
killed on both sides of this conflict, 
and it’s absolutely tragic anytime 
innocent people have to die,” Hass 
said. “We just want the violence to 
end.”

Ishigo believes that ASUCI’s 
decision to pass the resolution 
exhibits the strength and integrity of 
UCI’s students in globally protecting 
human rights. 

“I stand firmly by the students 
who believe it is their responsibility 
to have a voice on matters that urge 
the UC to be an institution that trea-
sures human dignity,” Ishigo stated 
in UCI’s divestment press release.

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Complete with arbitrators and mediators who range from retired small-town police officers to graduates of Harvard Law School, the newly launched website eQuibbly.com 
takes the legal system online.

The founder and current president, a lawyer named Lance 
Soskin, was inspired to create the website when he witnessed the 
failings of the judicial court system. He completed his J.D. and 
MBA degrees at Osgood Hall Law School and worked with the 
law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt as an attorney.

Soskin was inspired to create eQuibbly by a friend’s custody 
battle for her son. Although she was in the top 20 percent of 
income earners, it was still too expensive for her to fight a pro-
tracted battle in court.

“My friend’s lawyer told her that going on trial would cost 
between $30,000 and $50,000,” Soskin said. “I kept thinking, ‘If 
she can’t afford it, how does the other 75 percent of the popula-
tion afford it?’”

In one of his blog posts on eQuibbly, Soskin pointed to the 
difficulty of contesting a traffic ticket fine to highlight flaws of the 
court system.

“The only reason I can fathom for it is that the government 
wants to make it as difficult as possible to refuse to pay a fine. It is 
a cash grab,” he said. The more difficult it is for people to request 
a court date, the less likely they are to defend themselves.”

Online dispute resolution services have been around since 
the 90s. One of the first was created by eBay; the sheer number 
of disputes over online purchases made on its site led the makers 
of eBay to develop an online dispute resolution system with the 
University of Massachusetts in 1999. That service is still embed-
ded on its site under the name SquareTrade.

eQuibbly is different, however. For starters, it’s a standalone 
service, designed to be used for all conflicts, not just those related 
to a particular website or store.

“People post all types of disputes on eQuibbly,” Soskin said. 
“From the more superficial arguments between family, friends 

and roommates, to the more serious disputes dealing with visita-
tion issues between ex-spouses, business disputes, a homophobic 
college roommate or a friend who is an alcoholic. There are 
disputes dealing with infidelity, sex, religion and bullying, just to 
name a few.”

The website’s procedure for resolving conflicts is a form of 
alternative dispute resolution, defined as any method of resolving 
a dispute that bypasses the court system.

“[eQuibbly is] a relatively new type of litigation alternative,” 
Soskin wrote on the eQuibbly blog. “[It] has the potential to offer 
an even faster and cheaper means of resolving disputes than tra-
ditional Alternative Dispute Resolution — which includes media-
tion and arbitration.”

On the site, much of the work is done by a widely dispersed 
group of people, a process known as “crowdsourcing”.

Soskin argued against the notion that the public is not capable 
of making well-informed decisions about serious personal dis-
putes.

“Large groups of people are often smarter than an elite few,” 
Soskin said. 

There will occasionally be miscreant voting, Soskin acknowl-
edged. However, he said he thinks that the overall decision is one 
that will represent the wisdom of the crowd.

“For the most part,” Soskin said, “biases fade away as the 
number of voters increase.”

eQuibbly offers its users the choice of a public non-binding 
dispute, a private non-binding dispute or a private binding dis-
pute in resolving these types of disputes.

Public and private non-binding disputes differ only in the 
number of individuals that are allowed to vote. They are similar 
in that once a vote has been tallied, that decision is merely a sug-
gestion as to what should be done to resolve the conflict, not a 
legally-binding decision.  

Legal ties are only present in a private-binding dispute. In 
this type of dispute, the participating parties must sign an agree-

ment acknowledging that they are each legally bound by the out-
come of the arbitration. In the instance that one party refuses to 
acknowledge the outcome of arbitration, eQuibbly directs users 
to a local court. In private binding disputes, users are advised to 
hire a mediator or arbitrator.

The site offers its users a list of professional arbitrators and 
mediators that they can choose from. Using an arbitrator or a 
mediator is usually not free. 

“Most charge between $70 per hour to $150 per hour and 
some charge flat fees,” Soskin said.  “These fees are split between 
the parties so each pays half of the fee which makes it very afford-
able and much cheaper than paying for an attorney.”

eQuibbly does not take a cut out of any of these fees. 
The site instructs its users to first create an account with their 

name and email. Once they have created accounts, users can then 
post their dispute and invite the party at the root of the conflict to 
join as well.

Once both parties have agreed to use eQuibbly as a method 
of settling their disagreement, each party posts a web document 
called a testimony that others can read and make judgments on. 
eQuibbly offers a social media button which enables a user to 
invite friends to vote on the discussion.

Once the time span for voting has closed, one party is deemed 
the winner, and the resolution is resolved. If the negotiating par-
ties are at a standstill, eQuibbly also provides a list of mediators 
and arbitrators for all its registered users.

Soskin addressed the concern that the agreements reached on 
eQuibbly tend to favor the party who is more popular on social 
media sites, and therefore has more friends who can vote. This 
has been a growing concern after the integration of the social 
media button on the testimony page.

“Anyone can vote, and eQuibbly visitors seem to vote whether 
they know the parties or not. The more popular eQuibbly

becomes and the more traffic we 
get, the less reliant the parties will be 
on their friends since the other users 
will far outnumber them.”

Cyberjustice advocates like Soskin 
are not without their skeptics. Soskin 
stated that along with the positive 
feedback, there have been complaints 
from users that the eQuibbly team 
is trying to address. Some eQuib-
bly users have asked why eQuibbly 
administrators do not arbitrate dis-
putes themselves, given their collec-
tive legal expertise. 

“We have been giving this some 
thought but we have not yet come 
to a decision on this. We’re not 

sure how becoming involved in the 
disputes will affect this or whether 
most users even want eQuibbly to 
participate.”

Soskin said he wanted cash-
strapped undergraduates to turn 
to eQuibbly as a significantly more 
affordable and convenient way of 
seeking legal help.

“We would like college students 
to know that there is an alternative 
to suing a person or a company in 
court,” Soskin said. “College students 
no longer have to pay thousands of 
dollars in attorneys’ fees to get the 
justice they deserve.”

Website Created in Response to 
High Cost of  Formal Litigation 

BY STAceY cHIeN
Features Editorial Assistant

These days, a 30-mile drive to 
cross the Mexican border can easily 
turn into a several-hour long ordeal. 
Fortunately, a team of students from 
UCSD’s computer science and engi-
neering department have developed 
an iPhone app to help border crossers 
make informed choices about when 
and where to cross over — thereby 
avoiding frustrating waits in heavy 
traffic at popular crossing points. The 
app was released in the Apple App 
store on iTunes on Oct. 26.

The developers of this new app 
aim to generate a database of accu-
rate wait times for cars at both the 
Mexican and Canadian borders. A 
crowdsourcing feature called iReport 
in the application collects time esti-
mates from actual commuters, but 
only when they are in close physical 
proximity to a port. The develop-
ers compared their “crowdsourced” 
information with the wait times pro-
vided by U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection and integrated the two sets 
of data to improve the accuracy of 
both. 

“We get information from 
Customs and Border Protection and 
then we get the times from the users,” 
graduate student Tarfah Alrashed, one 
of the three developers, said. “Usually, 
the information we get from Customs 
and Border Protections is not that 
accurate, [so] we tried to implement 
something to improve the time infor-
mation we get from [them].”

Implementing the iReport feature, 
which broadcasts user-generated data 
in almost real time, has proven to 
be successful. However, because this 
feature relies on users disclosing their 
actual wait times when crossing the 
border, user participation is crucial.

“The users are really participat-
ing,” Alrashed said. ”We weren’t really 
sure that they could really give us the 

times that they really had to wait for. 
But they did, and it’s really amazing.”

The new iPhone app builds on 
an older service also called “Best 
Time to Cross the Border,” which 
was launched both online and as 
an Android app last April. Along 
with the traffic monitoring features of 
the original service, the new iPhone 
app incorporates not only current 

user-generated data but also histori-
cal graphs. The graphs reveal trends 
and average wait times from the past 
three months. The Android app is 
now compatible with the iReport fea-
ture, and in the near future, so will an 
application that is in the works for the 
mobile web.

The application has received 20 
ratings on iTunes, all of which are five 
stars out of five. Some online custom-
er reviews for the app read, “This app 
saves me a lot of time when crossing 
the border!” and “Super App!!!”

Computer science and engineer-
ing undergraduates Matthew Davis 

and Rodrigo Rollo helped Alrashed 
develop the iPhone application. “We 
worked really hard over the summer, 
and we were able to finish it within 
three months,” Alrashed said.

According to Alrashed, the ini-
tial idea for the app came from the 
personal experiences of the team’s 
project manager and California 
Institute for Telecommunications 

and Information Technology (Calit2) 
Principal Development Engineer 
Ganz Chockalingam. A trip to 
Mexico and a run in with heavy traf-
fic at the border prompted him to 
look for a solution to the problem.

“I’m hoping that a lot of people 
will use it, because I think a lot of 
people, especially here in San Diego 
where the border with Mexico is, 
really need something like this,” 
Alrashed said.

BY cYNTHIA feNG
Features Editor

The odd-looking, giant dome that 
looms over Muir parking lot P207 
has puzzled and intrigued UCSD stu-
dents for years.  It resembles a giant 
Moon Bounce, but there are no signs 
of merriment from within. The only 
entrance into the inflatable building 
is guarded by a sleepy-looking face 
carved into a wooden post.  Through 
a small window on the bolted metal 
door, curious outsiders can view 
a short hallway that leads up to 
another door with a sign that reads, 
“Warning: Strong Magnetic Fields.”

Dr. Stanley Opella, a UCSD pro-
fessor of chemistry and biochemistry, 
is the director of the team that oper-
ates the facility, the Nuclear Magnetic 
Resonance Resource Group. Fittingly, 
they’ve nicknamed the building  — 
which is officially called The NMR 
Resource Building — “The Bubble.” 
The group’s primary research goals 
are to develop new technology for 

NMR spectroscopy and use it to 
determine the shape of proteins that 
play significant roles in biomedical 
research. A protein is a complicated 
macromolecule with chains of amino 
acids that twist and turn and fold in 
upon themselves. Precisely determin-
ing the nuances of a protein’s shape 
can lead to a deeper understanding 
of its function, which is useful for cli-
nicians and medical researchers. 

“The structure determination of 
membrane proteins is very difficult 
by conventional methods, so we had 
to come up with a new approach,” 
Opella said.  “We wanted to develop 
the experimentation to study the 
proteins without changing them in 
any way.”

The Bubble houses five NMR 
spectrometers, each of which is 
attached to a giant superconduct-
ing magnet, the strongest of which 
has the potential to generate a 900 
Megahertz electromagnetic field, 
which is over 10 million times the 
strength of the earth’s natural mag-

netic field. These instruments are 
key to producing high-resolution 
images of proteins, with the power to 
measure down to the atom composi-
tion.

In the core of each magnet, 
researchers insert proteins, still 
embedded in cell membranes, to 
be mapped. The strong magnetic 
fields produce vibration frequencies, 
which agitate the membrane pro-
teins in complex patterns that allow 
the researchers to determine their 
structure. 

Specifically, Opella and his team 
study proteins that are embedded 
in cell membranes.  These proteins 
are essential for relaying chemical 
signals into and out of a cell. In addi-
tion, membrane proteins serve as 
important target sites for drugs, so 
a stronger knowledge of their struc-
tures could lead to the development 
of more precise drugs for human 
diseases. 

“We have the potential to solve 
the structure of every single protein,” 

Opella said.
Last month, the resource team 

successfully mapped the specific 
structure of the protein CXCR1, a 
high-affinity receptor for a signal-
ing protein, interleukin, which is a 
major mediator for the immune and 
inflammatory responses of many 
disorders, including tumor growth.

The key environment for NMR 
research is the air-supported design 
of “The Bubble,” which eliminates 
the need for metal support beams 
that would interfere with the mag-
netic field of each spectrometer.

“Inside, there is about 10 million 
dollars’ worth of equipment,” Opella 
said.

The facility was originally con-
structed in 2000 as a temporary 
site for the group’s research. But the 
research team quickly recognized the 
value of an inflatable plastic building 
for their research. 

“It is a structure that can stand on 
its own while being free of magnetic 
materials like steel,” he said.  “Once 

we discovered its usefulness, we 
decided it should be permanent.”

Even though the building sits at 
the corner of a college parking lot, 
it is far enough away from the street 
and the parking lot that the metal 
of cars does not affect the cutting-
edge research that takes place within 
“The Bubble.” The location was also 
selected for its close proximity to the 
chemistry and biochemistry depart-
ment building.

Even with its mysterious 
entrance, the building is not closed 
off to the public. “If students want 
to know more, they are welcome to 
schedule an appointment or ring the 
doorbell,” Opella said.

There’s nothing particularly dan-
gerous about the powerful magnets 
of the NMR Resource Building. 
Students are welcome to visit at any 
time, as long as they leave their cell 
phones, keys and lighters outside.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

The UCSD Women’s Soccer team could not have provided a stronger argument for fate as a documented phenomenon than its performance last weekend in Denver, Colo.The Tritons have played a combined 53 minutes and 53 seconds in their past five postseason competi-
tions. After taking down the No. 15 Colorado School of Mines in the Elite Eight round of the NCAA Division II 
Championships, on Thursday, Nov. 29 UCSD will face Grand Valley — the squad that shutout the Tritons in the 
Division II title match in 2010.

All of this happening after UCSD’s win over No. 23 Western Washington in the Elite Eight bout. The 2-1 
win also counted as UCSD head coach Brian McManus’ 433rd career win, making him the winningest coach in 
Division II Women’s Soccer history. The 26-year tenured coach will be making his fourth trip to the Final Four 
since UCSD’s move to Division II in search of his third Division II National Championship. 

“[McManus] has made this program what it is today, and I feel extremely lucky to be a part of his success,” 
senior captain Ellen Wilson said. 

On Sunday, UCSD was unable to finish off the Orediggers in regulation, although both teams had ample chance 
on goal, with Colorado Mines outshooting the Tritons 19-15. Credit true freshman goalkeeper Kelcie Brodsky 
along with the Triton backline, as UCSD logged its ninth shutout, while Brodsky recorded her 99th save. 

With the score still 0-0, the Tritons were forced to settle the game in penalties, just edging Colorado Mines 6-5. 
Senior midfielder Alexa Enlow slotted the winning goal for UCSD.

“It was great to win in penalty kicks,” senior midfielder Jessica Wi said. “For a while now we figured that we 
were cursed in penalty kicks, but having confidence in shootouts now is nice. Now we’re very excited for Georgia, 
and looking forward to getting redemption against Grand Valley.”

San Diego isn’t exactly known 
for its country music scene, but 
two-stepping Toby Keith fans 
have a haven in the bar and dance 
hall In Cahoots. With a spacious 
dance floor, pool tables and two 
bars, In Cahoots is the best way to 
turn around an average weekday. 
Their specials certainly help — 
Tuesday night is karaoke night, 
with no cover and $3 drinks. The 
Wednesday KSON night, featur-
ing $2.50 you-call-it-drinks, is so 
popular that it’s impossible to move 
onto the dance floor. On Thursday 
night, called “Spuds and Suds,” is 
the infamous $6 beer, steak and 
potato dinner special. For patrons 
with two left feet, In Cahoots hosts 
free dance lessons every day from 
6:30-8 p.m., so if you’ve been hold-
ing out on learning the Dallas 
Shuffle, it’s time to head down to 
Mission Valley. 

IN  CAHOOTS
BY MARGARET  YAU  MANAGING EDITOR 

Mission Valley

Located on the sketchier part of El 
Cajon Boulevard which extends to the 
east of the 805, Soda Bar is doubtless 
one of the best places to catch a show 
in San Diego. Though universally 
reviled by under-21 music aficiona-
dos, Soda Bar is the source of some of 
San Diego›s best concerts, including 
bands like Hospitality, Woods and 
How to Dress Well. The space could 
probably use some renovations, but 
with its small drink prices (any mixed 
drink is $5, a fact which is especially 
endearing when one considers that 
a can of PBR is $9 at the House of 
Blues), wide selection of beer on tap 
and unfussy attitude, Soda Bar man-
ages to overcome the sloppiness of its 
interior. Likely the best aspect of Soda 
Bar is the fact that one can go there on 
any night and be reasonably certain 
of finding something interesting to 
watch. Ticket prices rarely rise above 
$10 or $12.

5 PRETENTIOUS COffEE SHOPS

The newest gay bar in Hillcrest, 
1202 just finished remodeling and it 
looks amazing. It stands in place of 
the Eden Night Club, and carries on 
its reputation. The dark, urban deco-
rations set it apart from other night-
spots in the San Diego area, and with 
its comfy chairs, giant dance floor and 
cute bartenders, 1202 is the place to 
unwind and let loose. Even if you’re 
not into the gay scene, don’t fret. You 
will be surprised at how many straight 
guys are here partying with their 
queer friends. Unlike the fabulous 
Las Vegas party scene, 1202 is classy 
and has a friendly atmosphere. The 
crowd here is diverse, which adds an 
amazing vibe to the place. Along with 
fast bartenders and a great DJ every 
Saturday and Sunday night, 1202 is a 
spot you won’t want to miss. 1202 will 
have an official grand opening in the 
next couple of months so be sure to 
keep them on your radar.

Waiting in line for a club can 
drag down a night, but you will 
be surprised by how fast the line 
goes at Club Crawl, located in the 
heart of downtown San Diego. It’s 
only open one night a week, on 
Saturdays, but it will be a night to 
remember (or rather not to remem-
ber). With a big dance floor, the 
place is gorgeous; everything is 

grand and opulent, but the drinks 
are unbelievably cheap and oh-so 
good. Rage hard with their special 
shots and cocktails under $10. Keep 
an eye out for the classy yet hot 
bartenders.

Club Crawl and their partners 
are running a special promotion: 
Visit up to four clubs in San Diego 
for $20 including Club Crawl, 
Quality Social, Stingaree, Block 16, 
Analog and Onyx. It doesn’t matter 
if you’re a guy or a girl — getting in 
is a breeze. Quality Social and Block 
16 are especially great for students 

and young adults. The crowd is 
primarily 20s to 30s and they also 
feature live music on special nights. 
If you are visiting downtown San 
Diego for the first time, this might 
be the best way to carry your party 
around the entire city.

More than anything, Club 
Crawl is a party bar, packed every 
Saturday with beautiful people and 
their birthday balloons, and it is 
loud. Lose yourself in the impres-
sive sound and lighting systems — 
it won’t take long for you to get on 
your feet and bust a move.

14 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG



In their six postseason games — 
two CCAA matches, four NCAA 
matches — the Tritons have scored 
eight goals, all of which were fin-
ished by a member of their eight-
man senior class. The same group, 
supplemented by a strong squad 
of underclassmen, will prepare for 
their second meeting against Grand 

Valley State.
The Tritons will have 

Thanksgiving weekend off, and will 
then travel to Evans, Ga., the site of 
the Final Four. 

Along with Grand Valley, the 
2010 champion and winner of the 
Midwest Region, the Tritons will be 
joined by South Region Champion 
West Florida and East Region 
Champion St. Rose. 

In 2010, the Tritons faced St. 
Rose, narrowly beating the East 
Region Champion 1-0 off a goal by 
current UCSD assistant coach Sarah 
McTigue. 

UCSD has yet to face off against 
West Florida, a team that has only 
one loss in the season.

I first experienced the Tebowing 
craze last year. During school breaks, 
I’d go back to my hometown and 
train with my high school track team. 
During one of the practices, some 
of the boys got pretty rambunctious 
and started showing off. Doing their 
best to win each sprint, they playfully 

shoved each other around as they ran, 
their hooting and hollering getting 
louder and louder with each rep. After 
a particularly difficult set, the victor 
was elated — hopped up on endor-
phins, adrenaline and adolescence, he 
stripped off his shirt, whirling it about 
his head. He then dropped down to 
one knee, placing his fist on his fore-
head, eyes closed, brow furrowed.

Confused, figuring that my time 
in college had isolated me from high 
school trends, I asked one of the girls 
what he was doing. Incredulously, 
she looked at me as if I hadn’t experi-
enced pop culture since Beatlemania. 
“He’s Tebowing,” she replied matter-
of-factly.

Recognizing the name, I asked her 
what she knew about Tim Tebow. She 
shrugged. “He kneels after making a 
touchdown, and he’s in a lot of maga-
zines. And he’s super Christian, and 
he’s a virgin.”

I laughed at the time, writing off 
her reply as an average high school 
girl’s ignorance of the sports world. 
But as the craze continued, I encoun-
tered more and more people who 
could replicate the man’s victory 
stance and comment on his piety but 
knew little to nothing about his actual 
job — playing football.

This phenomenon of an athlete’s 
larger-than-life personality and antics 
overshadowing his career is noth-
ing new. My mom didn’t know that 
Dennis Rodman played basketball but 
knew that he wore a wedding dress 
during a promotional event and dated 
Madonna; many of my friends use 
George Foreman Grills to make their 
grilled cheese sandwiches but have 
no clue that he was a boxer. As Brian 
Phillips from Grantland comments 
in his article about Mario Balotelli’s 
career as a soccer personality, “You 
can only generate so much cartoon 
publicity before people start to see 
you as a cartoon.”

So, is this a problem? On the one 
hand, hearing about athletes’ exploits 
off the field is fun; it helps fans feel 

more connected to their favorite 
sports stars, generates publicity for 
the team and helps those who are not 
very involved in the sports world gain 
some sort of knowledge about the 
athletic realm.

On the other hand, at the risk of 
being considered a stuffy, “anal-reac-
tionary pundit” (as Phillips asserts), 
the media’s overzealous fascination 
with the smoke-and-mirrors aspect of 
athletes’ silliness can undermine the 
integrity of their sporting careers.

As much as I respect Tebow’s 
determination to keep it in his pants 
until he’s married, I don’t need to hear 
about it every time I look for Jets stats. 
And I don’t really care that Mario 
Balotelli likes to shoot fireworks out 
of his bathroom window, that Dennis 
Rodman enjoys wearing sequined 
halter tops or that David Beckham 
looks fantastic in a pair of boxer 
briefs. All of this is great in small 
doses (especially those boxer briefs), 
but I want to know about the reason 
they’re on my television screen in the 
first place: their athletic talent. And 
when the common population knows 
more about a football player’s sex life 
(or lack thereof) than his touchdown 
record, the media has failed him by 
portraying him as a cartoon character 
instead of a living, breathing, exceed-
ingly talented human being.

Tebow, More Than A Caricature?

MEN’S WATER POLO — In the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Conference Tournament held Sunday 
afternoon, Nov. 18, the UCSD Men’s 
Water Polo team took home second 
place after losing 7-9 to Air Force.

The Tritons end the 2012 season 
with a 16-8 overall record, includ-
ing 10 wins over nationally ranked 
NCAA Division I teams, and six 
WWPA honors recipients —  a pro-
gram record.

Seniors John Butler and Brian 
Donohoe received All-Tournament 
First Team honors for their outstand-
ing contributions during the tourna-
ment. Junior Josh Stiling also earned 
All-Tournament Second Team hon-
ors with seven goals scored during 
the tournament.

“It’s never easy to beat a team 
a fourth time,” UCSD Head Coach 
Denny Harper said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “Both teams 
knew each other real well; I thought 
it was a well-played game. They got 
some really timely goals, some time-
ly stops. They were the better team 
today. I thought our offense was actu-
ally moving along pretty well, the 
problem was we just couldn’t put the 
ball away. Their goalie [Mike] Fish 
had an exceptional game.”

While Fish managed 14 saves for 

Air Force, UCSD freshman goalkeep-
er Cameron Ravanbach also support-
ed the Tritons with 10 saves during 
the game. 

With the game going back and 
forth between Air Force and UCSD, 
the Tritons scored seven points with 
goals from Donohoe, Josh Stiling, 
Luke Syka, Matt Michalko and Butler, 
but the last two goals made by Air 
Force secured their position as the 
2012 WWPA Champions.

“We had a lot of things to deal 
with this year on a lot of fronts. I 
was real proud of how they handled 
all the different things that came our 
way. We will regroup as a program 
because we always do,” Harper said.

Air Force, seeded third in the 
tournament this year, is the first 
team in over a decade to sever the 
pattern of either UCSD or Loyola 
Marymount taking home first place 
in the WWPA Championships.

“I’m happy for Air Force and I 
think its great they will get to experi-
ence this for the first time,” Harper 
said.

After a strong showing in the 2012 
season, the UCSD Men’s Water Polo 
Team will have to wait another year to 
return to the WWPA Championships 
for the opportunity to go to the 2013 
NCAA Championships.

If you ever find yourself with a 
hankering for taro or red bean pas-
tries, salvation can be found on the 
ever-popular Convoy Street in Kearny 
Mesa. The Pangea Bakery Café boasts 
a wide selection of baked goods — 
the melon bread is especially tasty 
— and plenty of teas to match. They 
have also recently added smoothies 
and sandwiches to their menu. All 
of the artisan bread is baked fresh 
from scratch daily and with locally 
produced ingredients. But perhaps 
the most appealing part of Pangea is 
the atmosphere — it’s a cozy place to 
eat and socialize and even study if the 
fancy, or necessity, strikes. There is a 
piano available for (talented) patrons 
to use, and Pangea offers itself as a 
venue for open mic nights and live 
music as well. Pangea is located at 
4689 Convoy St Suite 100, perfect for 
dessert after a Convoy dinner or a 
snack after shopping.

Burgers will never be the same 
after Slater’s 50/50.  The pork-fat 
empire, famous for its 50/50 burger 
made of 50-percent ground beef and 
50 percent ground bacon, brings 
unorthodox burgers to your plate. 
There are the “Peanut Butter and 
Jealousy” – yes, this actually does 

mix up meat, peanut butter and 
jelly and, of course, bacon – and the 
“Burger Carbonara.” 

These burgers may sound too 
experimental, but just a taste of 
their 50/50 would convert any non-
believer. Just when people think 
Slater’s 50/50 has gone all in with 
their new artery-clogging burger 
for each month, they surprise their 
customers with bigger monstrosities, 

not to mention their latest “Election 
Burgers.” For the creative customer, 
Slater’s 50/50 offers customers the 
choice of creating their own burger 
off a checklist of almost anything 
possibly imaginable on a burger. 

Now also known for their bud-
ding late-night scene, featuring craft 
beers and sports game viewing for 
avid sports fans, Slater’s 50/50 is cer-
tainly not your average burger joint.

Burger Lounge in downtown 
La Jolla does the classic American 
favorite with a flavor-packed, healthy 
twist. The company confidently boasts 
grass-fed beef from a single farm in 
Kansas. Burger Lounge places the 
animals at the forefront of their burg-
ers, with special emphasis on the 
cow’s diet, which lacks antibiotics or 
hormones.

Every burger is served on a lounge 
bun (a blend of organic whole wheat 
and white flours with a touch of 
blackstrap molasses for sweetness) 
with crisp lettuce, fresh tomato, 
house-made Thousand Island dress-
ing, the option of organic Cheddar or 
American cheese and grilled or fresh 
onion. The company’s Classic Lounge 
Burger ($7.95) includes the simplest 
of these ingredients so that the beef 
may speak for itself. The burger is ten-
der, juicy and bears all of the flavors 
expected from the American favorite. 
Burger Lounge also offers alterna-
tives to beef, such as their Free Range 
Turkey Burger ($7.95) and Quinoa 
Veggie Burger ($7.95).

Against the landscape of the fancy boutiques of downtown La Jolla — and 
about two miles away from Mitt Romney’s beach home — stands a tiny, daring 
taco shop. Don Carlos, which proudly boasts the tagline “Ugly, gaudy, and looks 
like Mexico” (echoing criticisms by neighboring businesses), is a gem among La 
Jolla’s lacking-Mexican-fast-food scene. For the same price as most other taco 
shops, Don Carlos’s made-to-order fare, loaded with the freshest ingredients, is 
the best value in town. The shop also stocks “soyrizo,” a spicy, soy-based meat 
replacement that even real chorizo fans have to admit packs the necessary flavor 
to keep vegetarian Mexican food from being a bland afterthought. Make sure to 
try their homemade hot sauces. But before visiting the shop, which unfortunate-
ly doesn’t deliver, make sure to call in — their opening hours tend to vary.

Many posers like to say, “I’m so 
hungry I could eat a cow!” Let’s get 
real: If you’re hungry, eat a cow. If 
you’re hungry, go to Manna. A short 
drive to Convoy is your solution to 
turn the figurative into the literal. 
Literal, you might ask? Yes, there are 
beef tongue and rib and intestine and 
brisket. Voila, your cow. But along 
with your “cow” comes an array of 
vegetables that, of course, a bovine 
might eat. The combination of the 
specially seasoned beef and pickled 
sides remind you that simple is good. 
What does come with this dream of 
pasture is an immense wait on prime 
days, so avoid dinner times on the 
weekend or sit in the agony of food 
being cooked before your eyes when 
you cannot do anything about it. 
Regardless, at a flat $20, it’s eat till you 
pass out. How’s that for a night out?

P.S. A token Korean will be to 
your benefit.

Sometimes, the original is hard to beat.
This is certainly the case with the Prepkitchen res-

taurants, a popular trio of fusion-gastro pubs owned and 
operated by celebrity chef Arturo Kassel. Yelp users have 
rated the old La Jolla PK 4.8 out of five, or nearly a full 
star higher above the newer Del Mar and Little Italy loca-
tions — good news for hungry UCSD students. 

At Prepkitchen, steer clear of the classic American 
offerings and stick to the fusion fare: When we tried 
them, the tuna melt and roast beef were mushy, unin-

spired and far too bland. In contrast, it’s hard to go 
wrong with items like the nettle and mint tagliatelle, the 
bacon-wrapped dates and the persimmon & bacon rolls.

If you’re craving a sandwich, however, get something 
like the duck confit panini with machengo, roasted 
pumpkin and orange jam instead. Don’t worry if you 
don’t know what some of the ingredients are. In fact, it’s 
probably for the best, because this is where Prepkitchen 
shines: taking the ordinary and using a hint of the 
unknown to make it incredible.

In the vibrant neighborhood of Ocean Beach lies Sappora Sushi, a lively 
Japanese restaurant and bar with reasonably priced delicious meals. The sushi 
is served quickly, the portion sizes are very generous and the rainbow rolls are 
a particular highlight. They always have a great deal, like 50 percent off selected 
sushi rolls and combination dinners for around $10. The restaurant has a classy 
decor and a constant hum coupled with tasteful background music. You can 
even come and watch the game — sit on a stool snacking on the freshest sashimi 
and then either celebrate or drown your sorrows at the bar. At Sappora you can 
easily satisfy your tastebuds without spending more than about $15.

If you’re a vegetarian or vegan looking for a restaurant that you don’t have 
to drag your friends to, make sure to visit Sipz at least once during your time 
in San Diego. Adorned by mini-Buddha statues and paper lanterns, Sipz looks 
like any hippie-dippie place on San Francisco’s Haight Street, and their menu is 
entirely vegetarian. But the soy-based “chicken,” “pork” or “beef” meat replace-
ments that come with many of their foods are heavy and make for a hearty 
meal, and are also well-flavored by Sipz’s many flavorful sauces and curries. The 
Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese and Japanese inspired dishes include rice bowls, noo-
dles, sushi, wraps and even a surprisingly healthy, yet delectable, dessert menu. 
Sipz also does take-out, and the generous portions provide at least two meals’ 
worth of food per order.

Somewhere between Hillcrest and 
Gaslamp, Piatti Ristorante and Bar 
demands to stand out in La Jolla, a 
neighborhood that is normally popu-
lated with the up-and-coming middle-
class population. Claiming the corner 
spot of the street, the store’s lights, 
decorations and white walls give it an 
elegant, yet homey feel. The dishes 
you’ll see on the menu will be just as 
comforting. The linguini ($19.95), 
covered in an assortment of fresh 
shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari, 
has delightfully surprising splashes of 
lemon, chili flakes and white wine to 
round out the classic dish. The affog-
ato ($6.95) is a must have to finish off 
your meal: This vanilla gelato soaked 
with amaretto and a shot of espresso 
is topped with whipped cream and a 
sprinkle of chocolate shaving wisps.

Forget about Cotixan: Tucked 
away in the often-sleepy University 
Heights, El Zarape is an excellent 
alternative to the greasy, all-night 
burrito places that surround cam-
pus. Take their California burrito 
($5.50). Though smaller than those 
usually found in San Diego, boasts 
fresh, lime-saturated guacamole and 
high-quality carne asada. Also amaz-
ing is Zarape’s selection of seafood 
dishes, like calamari burrito ($6) or 
their mind-blowing shrimp and fried 
fish burrito ($6). For $8, Zarape will 
serve you a shrimp burrito, a fish 
taco and rice and beans. Their salsas 
are unparalleled, their employees are 
completely non-judgmental and if all 
this wasn’t convincing enough, they 
serve stellar fish tacos for $1 at all 
times of the week.

When you come to San Diego, 
there are a few things you just have 
to accept wholeheartedly: the beach, 
surfers and Phil’s BBQ. Located right 
next to the San Diego Sports Arena, 
Phil’s is the quintessential SD restau-
rant. With a guaranteed three-hour 
line out the door, these ribs are no 
joke. Save yourself the trouble and 
go on a weekday when the crowd has 
died down, and make sure to wear 
your stretchy pants because Phil’s 
doesn’t skimp on portions. Your best 
bet is the pulled pork sandwich or 
the baby back ribs with macaroni 
salad or coleslaw on the side. Bring 
a friend, share a meal and prepare 
yourself for the biggest food baby 
you’ll ever conceive. Be sure to take 
a picture in the Phil’s photo booth 
while waiting in line.
