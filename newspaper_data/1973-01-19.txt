Ta.ch -In Faalures Marcuse. Schiller. Kitty Hawk Sailors 
Greg Moser 

Despite the heavy rain, people packed the Re~elle 
Cafeteria to hear Herbert Marcuse, professor emeritus 
at UCSD and Herbert Schiller, professor of com-
munications explain the the latest developments in the 
Vietnam war, on the first ni ght of a three part teach-in 
which ended yesterday. The teach-in organized by the 
Radical Coalition, was in response to what has been 
called one of the most stringent news blackouts of the 
war. As part of this blackout, President Nixon will not 
give his State of the Union address to either Congress 
or the American people. The teach-in addressed itself 
to the question of exactly what "Peace with Honor" is 
supposed to be. 

Herbert Marcuse spoke first. He said that even if a 
cease fire were signed immediately it would solve 
nothing. The political problems would remain. " We are 
in Vietnam, and in one form or another, we will stay in 
Vietnam to prevent the forces of nationalismfrom 
tak ing over a strategically important area." He 
emphasized that he did not mean the forces of com-
munism, although a small part of the nationalist forces 
are communist. He said, "We cannot say in any sense 
that we are waging a war against communism. 

The war goes on, he said, because the American 
people do nothing about it. "We are still very well off," 
he said. "The war does not affect us very much. It is 
very far away. And it is waged against non-whites." 

If I suggest that there is solidarity among sufferers, 
that there can be but feelings against those who cause 
suffering, I would be accused of using literal and 
romantic shit." But, he said it is those who feel this that 
must be roused to action, and that all must feel this 
solidarity. 

He spoke of our society, and recalled, by his accent 
and manner, another society of fear. from which 
Marcuse fled . "The immoral character of the 
(American) society makes for a systematic brutalization 
of life." Through years of war we have, "Iearned 
apathy, learned immorality, and this enables us to 
napalm, to shoot, to kill. " 

He said, we set ourselves above the rest of the world 
t6 sit in judgement to decide what is right and wrong 
for a people. It is with the tacit consent of the people 
that the government can maintain this attitude, he said. 
"The government controls and steers a submissive 
population. Never before have a free people so easily 
renounced their freedom. " He said the apathetic and 
defeatist population in America was guilty of war 
crimes, that it was guilty of putting up with this 
govern ment, and guilty for electing such officials. "This 
may be the last opportunity to oppose a fascist govern-

ment in the United States," he said. "There is prevalent 
in this country what is well-defined in psycho-
sociological terms as a sado-masochistic personality 
whose major characteristics are brutal aggression, sub-
mission, and a preoccup<ltion with morbidity." 

He urged those present to counteract these forces. 
"Educate yourselves where educators do not. These 
seem small things, but they are not. Find out what is 
going on. Discuss these things with others. Break the 
barriers of communication that exist . Talk with 
everyon~, even those who society says you can not talk . 
Organize demonstrations." • 

There is an old political argument that says that a 
message grows weaker and weaker the more it is 
repeated, he said . "This is not true. Learn the political 
value of repitition. The more you are 'lble to repeat, 
demonstrate, to draw attention to what you want, the 
stronger the message becomes." 

He said that historically all great changes of ideology 
began with protest. The main requirement for in-
stituting change he said was to "gain numerical 
strength." To achieve this, he said, "the only require-
ment is unity on the left. This is the time when 
ideological differences are unrealistic, and those who 
still adhere to them live in fantasy ." 

Finally, he defined what is "Peace with Honor." "It is, 
" he said," the " honor" defined by Nixon. For us a 
peace with honor is a peace now. With physical and 
financial restitution for the damage we have caused . 
This is a definition of Peace with Honor." 

The venerable, white-haired Marcuse then walked 
off the stage, turning to he audience just before he sat 
down to raise his fist in a power-to-the-people salute. 

Herbert Schiller presented a witty, acid history of 
U.S. invo:vment in Vietnam. He, too, spoke of an 
uninformed, impotent America , and of the lessons 
which should have, after twelve years of war, been 
learned. "We have learned, "he said," that government 
officials systematically lie. This is now called the 
credibility gap. Anyone running for office today who 
does not have one does not have the background 
necessary to hold office." 

He said American med ia could not be counted on to 
close the gap, that they had, in fact, been the creators 
of it and supported officals' efforts to lie and obfuscate 
their lies. He pointed to the extensive and useless 
knowledge about dating and toilet habits of officials 
that is abundantly supplied by the media. 

He said forign newspapers and magazines can inform 
about world opinion. 

How do you get information about what 's going on 
in America? You steal it," he said. 

Finally, he said that Vietnam has lasted through five 
or six presidents and this alone should be enough to 
convince anyone that "Vietnam is not an accident. 

You have to critically evaluate each piece of new 
information and fit it into your view of things. Thus, 
each development does not shock and surprise you. It 
becomes part of your knowledge. Otherwise, you 
always end up starting at the same low level, understan-
ding nothing". 

The teach-in continued Wednesday night with infor-
mational presentations by three defendants from the 
Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier, who were tried in connec-
tion with alleged race riots, and representatives from 
Viet Nam Veterans Against the War. 

On Thursday the Teach-In continued in the Revelle 
Cafeteria with presentations by Banning Garrett, 
member of Asia Information Group and writer for 
Ramparts Magazine, and the Radical Coalition speakers 
among others. 

ED NOTE: 
On Oct. 12, a skirmish 

aboard the USS Kitty Hawk 
received national press 
coverage whin it was dis-
covered that strained race 
relations aboard ship was 
the cause of the so-called 
"riot". 

Kitty Hawk 21 Present Their View and attempted murder, Captain Townsend waited 
for more than a month to 
bring the sailor to Captain's 
Mast, at which at which 
t ime the charges were 
dropped. 

The following informa-
tion was provided by the 
" Ki tty Hawk 21" com-
mittee, the 21 Black sailors ' 
faci ng courts-martial as a 
resu lt of an incident in-
volving both bllck and 
whites. 
Background. Black sailors 
on the Kitty Hawk felt the 
atmosphere aboard ship 
was tense and strained for 
qu ite some time. Day to 
day acts of institutional and 
individual racism by white 
sai lors apinst Blacks made 
he situation almost un-

bearable. The tense racial 
situation was made worse 
because the Kitty Hawk 
was on the line (In the 
battle zone) for nine to ten 
months Insteld of the usual 
six. Many people felt ClP-
tain Townsend, the ship'S 
CO, was bucking for In 

admiralship and that their 
extended cruise was purely 
an attempt to gain personal 
glory at their expense. 

Job discrimination 
against Blacks was rampant 
and constituted one fo the 
brothers' main grievances. 
Blacks were given jobs as 
mess cooks, scrub boys and 
lavatory cleaners while 
white sailors with lower 
GCT & ARI aptitude test 
scores Ind less seniority 
receive the job 
classifications they wanted. 
In some cases, Blacks In 
higher rates were reduced 
to mess cooks because 
white mess cooks wanted 
to advance to I better rate. 

Blacks, Chicanos, and 
Filipinos almost exclusively 
work in whit Is called "the 
hole" - the lower levels of 
the ship. Whites 
preponderantly populate 
the upper levels of the 
ship. In times of bad 
weather, whites are the 

first to receive orders to 
don weather gear; in one 
case, a Black sailor on the 
flight deck was never given 
the order and remained 
soaked and dripping at his 
P95t. When a Black sailor 
who had only one more 
month to go in the Navy 
requested to be taken off 
the flight deck because 
someone had been blown 
off the ship recently and 
had never been found, he 
was fined $500.00 and 
ordered to his new assign-
ment cleaning lavoratories 
13 to 1. hours a day. 

Blacks were denied the 
right to peaceful assembly. 
There was a standing order 
aboard ship to break up 
any group of Blacks 
numbering more than two 
or three people. Twenty 
white sailors could sit 
together at a table but four 
Blacks could not. This was 
an undue hardship on the 
Blacks on board . They 

. 

could not relate to the 
white sailors because they 
were racist and because 
the two groups had widely 
different cultural 
backgrounds. Blacks were 
being prevented from get-
ting together with their 
friends because of the ban 

'on more than three Blacks 
being together. There was 
also a deliberate policy not 
to berth more than three 
Blacks together. This just 
aggravated the situation 
because there is an on-ship 
rule that you cannot go 
into a berth unless you 
belong there; in other 
words, there is no visiting 
among the different 
berths. 

There were other ex-
amples of harassment and 
discrimination during the 
Kitty Hawk's cruise. Blacks 
who went to Captair.'s 
Mast (non-Judicial punish-
ment) on the Kitty Hawk 
could always expect to 

receive stiffer penalties 
than white sailors who 
committed similar or more 
serious offences. There 
were many instances when 
clothing and other per-
sonal property was thrown 
overboard by whites. 

The power salute and the 
dap (Black handshake) 
were banned; two Blacks 
are now in the brig for 
committing these "crimes" 
(performed only in 
solidarity with other Black 
brothersnot during colors 
or other official 
ceremonies). 

During the ship's stay at 
Sublc Bay Naval Station in 
the Philippines, a white 
sailor in the lower ranks 
from the Kitty Hawk hired 
Filipino national to assault 
random Blacks. At least 5 
Blacks suffer d multiple 
lacerati ons and tab 
wounds. Even after this 
white sailor was id ntified 
and ac u ed of con piracy 

The Incident. Captain 
Townsend, CO of the Kitty 
Hawk, ordered the Marine 
Detachment on board (ap-
proximately 200 Marines) 
to break up any group of 
Blacks who walked more 
than two abreast. l~ss than 
an hour later, this same 
Captain Townsend told a 
group of 25 to 30 Blacks 
who had come to air their 
grievances that Blacks 
could congregate in any 
number and any place so 
long a it was a peaceful 
gatherin~ . Blacks disper ed 
from the meeting and 
proceeded to various part 
of.tw- hir I, th~

tacked b Marine with

Women Writer in a 
Male Culture 

"The Woman Writer in a Male Culture" will be 
discussed by Christiane Rochefort , French novelist 
from Paris, France, at a Literaturt! Department Informal 
Wednesday afternoon meeting on january 24, 1972 at 4 
p.m. in the Formal Lounge, Revelle. Ms. Rochefort has 
been widely acclaimed for her novel Le repos du 
guerrier 1958; trans. Warrior's Rest, McKay, N.Y:, a 
study of the privatism of a man-woman relationship. 
She has continued her satirical commentary on modern 
life in Les Petils enfanls du siecle (1961; trans. The 
Children of Heaven), a tale of the rootless life in the 
new working-class suburbs of Paris; Les Stances a 
Sophie (1964; trans. as Cats Don't Care for Money and 
recently made into a film using American jazz musician 
Joseph Jarman and his group on the soundtrack); In 
1969, her novel Le Prinlemps au Parking dealing with 
the search for a new life-style by the youth of the 
sixties, came out. Her latest book,C'est bizarre, /' 
ecrilure is the story of the writing of a novel. She is an 
active member of the Women's Liberation Movement 
in France (MLF) and has appeared as a spokewoman on 
French television. All are welcome to attend the 
discussion. 

CAB and Youth Fares 
On December 7, 1972, 

the Civil Aeronautics Board 
announced that results of 
their Domestic Passenger-
Fare Investigation : "that 
youth standby, youth 
reservation and family fares 
are unjustly discriminatory 
and that family and youth 
reservation fares are also 
unreasonable." The Board 
did defer cancellation of 
these fares pending further 
hearing on the question of 
an adjustment to normal 
fares. 

The purpose of CRADF, 
in the words of Russell 
Lehrman, President of 
Continental Marketing 
Corporation, a youth fare 
card sales concern, "will be 
to alert every traveler 
affected, advise them that 
they may lose from 25% to 
33% air fare reductions if 
they don't act. .. to express 
their views so that they will 
be heard." 
. An open appeal is being 
mailed e<ch college 
newspaper n an ad that 
can be placed by the editor 
as a service ' or his readers. 
The ad will carry a tear-out 
letter, to he signed by 
reader s, appealir>e 10 

Congress to act on legisla-
tion that can pave the way 
for continuation of these 
discount fares. The letters 
will be submitted to the 
C RADF Off ice in 
Washington, D.C. where 
they will be systematically 
sorted bi Congressional 
district, counted to 
measure response, and 
finally forwarded to the 
proper Congressmen. 

National Student Lobby 
Leaders will then go into 
action. They will visit the 
members of the House and 
Senate Commerce Com-
mittees in an effort to get at 
least one Republican and 
one Democratic sponsor 
for necessary legislation 
from each committee . 
They will work with staffs 
of the committees, airline 
respresentatives, senior 
citizens and other groups 
interested in preserving 
the discount fares. 

On Feburary 28th a 
National Student Lobby 
Conference wi ll be held, 
with students from all parts 
of the country in atten-
dance, to consider this 
problem. At that time, the 
delegates will visit with

their own legislators to 
urge positive and final ac-
tion to retain these impor-
tant fares. 

In january, 1968, CAB ex-
aminer' Arthur S. Present 
ruled that discount fares 
limited to persons 12 to 21 
years old are "unjustly dis-
criminatory" because age 
along. isn't a valid distinc-
tion between passengers. 
Shortly therefater, Mr. Pre-
sent received mail from 
college students by th e 
sack load. Thei r expression 
of opinion was so 
overwhelming that the 
CAB ruled that airline 
youth fare discounts don't 
unjustly discriminate 
against adults. The board 
put off any decision on a 
petition to abolish the dis-
cou nts until a study of 
whether the fares were 
reasonable in relation to 
carrier costs was com-
pleted. 

Originall y youth fares 
were challenged b y 
Nat ional Trailways Bus 
System, a trade association 
of bus companies, and by 
TCO Industr ies, Inc ., 
formerly Transcontinental 
Bus System, Inc. 

Over $300 million is 
spent by young people on 
youth fare tickets annually. 
Each year over 1 million 
yo uth fare cards are 
bought by young people 
who believe that they are 
entitled to its benefits until 
age 22. If the fare is 
abolished, privileges of the 
card would be revoked.

drawn. The captain 
watched while a white 
sailor called the Blacks 
" Black bastards" and did 
nothing to reprimand him. 
Meanwhile, Blacks who 
were not a part of the 
original contingent of 25 
heard about the attack on 
their brothers and came to 
their assistance. By the time 
the melee was over, 200 of 
the 636 Blacks on board 
(there are 5,000 men on the 
Kitty Hawk) were involved. 
The Black marines aboard 
ship laid down thei r arms 
and refused to join the 
attack on their brothers. 
The Bl acks · defended 
themselves as well as they 
could and tried to leave the 
area of fighti ng. But the 
white sailors were starting 
to congrega te in gangs to 
attack the wounded Blacks. 
The Bl acks had to band 
together for survival. 
Threatened with denial of 
medical treatment until the 
whites were all taken ca re 
of, a hint was dropped that 
there might not be any sick 
bay unless the Blacks were 
a Iso treated. 

For the following three 
weeks, the Blacks worked, 
ate, and slept with the 
same people who had at-
tacked them. They were 
not placed in the sh ips 
brig. On Nov. 7, they were 
placed in confinement in 
Subic Bay for 13 days.

brig solely on the words of 
white sailors. Blacks were 
not allowed to press 
charges on an y on e 
because "they had been in 
the wrong." 

While the brothers were 
in the Subic brig, base 
authorities assured them 
that upon th eir return to 
the States they would be 
met by thei r families and 
defense attorneys. Instead 
they were flown under 
armed guard to N. Island 
Naval Air Station incom-
municado and the only 
people they sa w upon 
arriving was the base CO 
and brig author ities. 

After being transferred 
to the 32nd St. brig, the 21 
(3 had already been con-
victed and one had charges 
dropped while still aboard 
the Kitty Hawk) w ere 
placed in individual 6' x 7' 
ce lls and not allowed to be 
with other prisoners until 
12 days later (and then only 
for meal hours) . Food was 
shoved under the door, 
scraping half of it off and 
leaving dirt on the rest of it. 
One Black had a nervous 
breakdown and was told by 
a doctor that he should not 
be in confinement, but the 
brig authorities stated that 
the brig was the best poss i-
ble place he could be since 
he could not harm himself 
there. Th e CO of the 32nd 
St. brig has told Blacks that 
they are now allowed to 
eat with other prisoners.

Dear Eddie: 
Advice to the Messed Up 

Dear Eddie, 
Whenever I get the late night munchies, I instinctive-

ly reach for the Kellogg's cornflakes. Unfortunately, the 
inside wrapper is waxed paper and when I unwrinkle it 
to get some flakes, it wakes up my roomate. It wouldn't 
be a problem if he didn't give me a bloody nose; and 
maybe not even them, except lately both nostrils are 
bleeding. What would you adviser 

Scabby 
De~r Scab, 

The best thing I can advise is to get in the habit of 
wearing a football helmet while eating. If nothing else, 
you r roomate has less to hit. Maybe some of our 
readers can help. What say, gangr 

De~r Eddie, 
I represent a group of telepathics. Last night we met, 

trying to find the Northwest Passage. As luck would 
have it, our guide was Amelia Earhart. True to form, she 
didn't know where she was going and all we saw was 
cornflakes. 

' I know Scab's problem. I used to eat cornflakes at 
night, too. My parents arrived at a novel solution to the 
noise problem. It is called a bullwhip: Use it on your 
roommate, Scabby. It's a sweetheart . 

By the way, we kids also found a solution for our 
parents. We called it the final solution.

Address letters to Dr. Arnold Werner, 

Box 9~4, East Lansing, Mi. 48623 
QuestIon: Most of my girlfriends are 
not very well endowed in the breast 
area; those who are all sag quite a bit. 
Recently I saw an ad for a massage unit 
r~puted to help a girl obtain youthful 
flrmne.ss (copy enclosed) . I ' m 
wondenn~ whether this device has any 
t~erape~tlc value or is it only for erotic 
stImulation. 
Anw,er: Incrediblel Absolutely in-
cred,blel For only $16.65 (post-paid) a 
woman can obtain a device resembling 
a. small plumber'S helper mounted 
SIdeways that is battery driven and 

produc~s "a warm, glowing feeling." 
The ad, Illustrated with a photograph of 
a nude woman with unusually pointy 

b~easts, also states that "you can main-
tain ~nd strengthen the natural beauty 
an.d frr~~ess of your own breasts, with 
thiS excIting, effective vibrating breast 
massager." Note the wording folks ' the 
ad cleverly a~oids stating th~t it 
produces anything that isn't already 
there. 
. Y~ur complaint is one that I have 

d,ff,culty res~onding to with sympathy, 
I get t~e feelIng that you will never be 
ha~/y In y~ur quest for a perfect breast 
or If you find one, there would have to 
be something else the matter with the 
person the breast is attached to. While 
most. men find a woman's breasts 
pleaSing to look at and touch the 
breast are really quite unremarkable 
a pp~ndages and are the least constant 
~hyslcal features of a woman, changing 
In shape and size as a woman ages and 
as h~r body weight changes. Thei; one 
fuctlo~al attribute, feeding the new-. 
born, IS accomplished whether they are 
round or square, big or small ugly or 
pretty. ' 

S.ome women do derive erotic sen-
sa tIons from sti mulation of thei r 

b~easts , but I doubt if many think that 
sllmulation is worth '16.65. 
9uestion : In lieu of spending the 
tIme: ?"on~y, and energy to consult a 
phYSICian In perso~ , I am writing to 
yo u. Your column IS no substitute for 
the long. gone confidential chat with 
thhe famll~ physician ... but it's better 
t an nothing. 

I would like to know about w isdom

There Is No Shortcut 
Dr. Ralph Lewin, Prolessor of Marine Biology at Scripps, offers thiS,?rticle 

for your consideration. The article, entitled "There Is No Shortcut , IS a 
portion of Yale President Kingman Brewster, Jr.'s address to th~ Freshman 
Class. It is reprintep with permission from the No~ember 1~72 Issue of the 
Yale Alumni Magazine. copyright by Yale Alumnr Publications, Inc . 

It is said that there is a "new quiet" 
settling upon the co lleges and univer-
sities. Maybe; but I do not think it runs 
very deep. Obviously you know better 
than I. WHAT YOUR MOOD IS . 
However, I do know something about 
the moods of your predecessors. 

There have been three quite different 
ways in which some students over the 
last ten years sought to fi nd some pur-
pose, some zeal, in the undergraduate 
years . Each patent medicine was 
somewhat oversold - over-indulged in 
by some, treated with indifference by 
others. Their prescript ion has been 
followed by a measure of disillusion-
ment. Yet e ach overdose has left a 
resid ue of change - for the most part, 
constructive change. 

One of these nostrums was the cry for 
" re levance" . At best this was an unhap-
py form of speech, for relevance is a 
d e pe nden t word . It prompts the 
q uestion: " relevan t to what?" The urge 
was fo r le arning which is concerned 
with the current ills of the world. Such 
slogans as "the only purpose of learning 
is action" left no roo m for the searcch 
for truth or beauty or goodness" for its 
own sake ." The enthusiasm was activist. 
There was an impatience to work on the 
immediate problems of peace, poverty 
and race - NOW! 

The cult of relevance wa s made 
rest less and frus trated by the hard work 
which it takes to master the d isciplines 
and professions. Yet without su ch com-
mand there is li ttl e chance to have much 
leverage on many social problems. Most 
particularly, the demand for relevance 
was scornful of history . The paradox was 
that some of the students' most far-out 
faculty mentors were revisionist 

hi~torlans. 
Disillusion with "relevance" set in, I 

believe, in part because spot news h.a~ a 
high rdte of obsolescence. ActiVist 
cliches wore pretty thin. Slogans could 
not long disguise ignoranc , and stri-
dent impatience was often revealed as a 
cover for sloppiness. Also, real problems 
just did no bend to the .hot win.ds of 
rhetOriC, nor did they Yield easll.y to 
mindless action, no matter how highly 
motivat('d. 

Nev('rthe' ss, the cause of 
"rei vance" d d have its pmitive impact. 
Some faculty nembPrs were persuaded 
to re-think thl! significance of what they 
were doing. T,e organization of courses 
and seminars around social problems 
took its place a '18 ;~ .. df'srriptive and 
analytical and c itical learning based . on 
the single dl~Li pline. Perhaps most Im-
portant, edu(at rs were reminded that 
the motivati :)(1 for lea rning can be 
tremendously heightened if students 
have more 0 a chance to des ign their 
own programs and are given some 
chance of fas h ion ex pe rimen tal 
seminars w hich re fl ect their d epest 
cu rre nt co ncerns. 

Ca rr ied to its ult imate x treme; 
re levance-worsh ip wou ld destroy liberal 
education. It would di ctate an entirely 
vocational ducation. But its cham-
pionship has requ ir da re-Justification 
of what w do. It has loos ned the 

bonds of what used to be a rigidly 
prescribed and narrowly departmen-
talized education. 

Another campus characterisitc run-
ning from the mid-60's into the turn of 
the decade was the glorification of the 
" happen ing" . Anything was good as 
long as it expressed the real. now self . 
For some, spontaneity was king. Any 
critical standards which might give ob-
jective definition to the good, the true 
or the beautiful were banished. " Doing 
your thing" was beaut iful because it was 
your very own thing of the moment. This 
enthusiasm deprecated all manners , 
modesty and mentality. . 

Ultimately this cult, too, would make 
the univ e rsity tradition quite 
anachronistic. For without reason to 
monitor the objective search for truth , 
there is little need or justification for 
systemat ic learning or research . You 
would not need all the paraphernalia of 
fa cihties, courses, curricula - let alone 
grades, credits and degrees- simply to 
provide a happening. 

But the worship of spontaneity did 
inject a provocative and invigorating 
influence . It leavened the dry and 
somet imes arid log ic-chopping and 
footnote-gathering of some rational 
analysts and the critics. The often defiant 
irrationality of the " counter culture" has 
perhaps had the effect of "counter 
culture" has perhaps had the e ffect of 
stre ngthening the defenses of the 
culture. It has also awa kened all but the 
most insensitive to a renewed apprecia-
tion of those imme asurable dimensions 
and dep ths of life wh ich are beyond the 
power o f numbers to describ e and of 
reason to explain. Intuition and imagi na-
tion, particularly in the arts, have gained 
a new status in the house of intellect. 

In the afterma t h of t h e " livi ng 
theater" and the "living classroom," 
however, there is a yearni ng fo r struc-
ture - a sense of the emptiness wh ih is 
left even after a full menu of dis-
organized experience in the raw. 

A third element , which so preoc-
cupied the press and the polit icians and 
the parents - and the college 
presidents - as the '60's tu rned into 
'70's, was the fad of trashing. It brought 
out the worst in th e relatively few who 
were involved. M ore often than not it 
set back the cause which was its alleged 
excuse . It degraded the trashers because 
it often smacked of exh ibi tio nist tan-
trum. Its ugliness bred a cou nt er-
ugliness in the backlash of p ubl ic opi-
nio n and the uptight ness of official reac-
tiu n. 

Fortunately, th e re h a~ b e e n a 
spread ing awareness that vio le nce does 
not help a cause and th at it pl ays into th 
hands o f stubborn, repressive reaction . 
Neverth e l ss muh of the disobedient 
protest, specially in its non-vio.lent 
form , was an important technique of 
communication when effective expres-
sion of concern was felt to be thwarted 
or stifl d by the established channels of 
politics and authority. When protest was 
imbu d with s Iflessness and scarifice, 
rath r than by egotism and se lf -
congratulation, the messag got through 
when otherwise it might not.

We Need The 
Spirit of 
Conciliation 
The Editor Triton Times 

Scanning recent issues of 
. the TRITON TIMES and the 

SAN DIEGO UNION, I was 
struck by certain parallels 
which may indicate a 
characteristic of American 
psychology. The students 
make "demands" of the 
Chancellor. The Americans 
make "demands" of the 
Viet n a mese . W e 
sometimes seem to behave 
like petulant children . As 
we mature, personally and 
nationally, we need to 
learn more about the spirit 
of conciliation - and the art 
of diplomacy. 

Respectfully - as usual! -

J. COWARD! 
Dear J. 

You are a coward ! It is 
your fear of people that 
prevents you from dis -
closure of yourself. People 
(society) are not mons ters, 
bu t your fear is your 
monste rous react ion to self 
disclosu re. I am sure you 
will fi nd peoples reactions 
to your d isclosures will be, 
very human and natural, 
just like yo ur reactions. 

Society is like the sea .. , 
powerfu l in it's assertion, 
helpless in it's shape, and 
moved by the forces of 

nature. If you go around 
presenting yourself to 
others you will discover 
that 'you are a force of 
nature. You actually have 
power. And society will 
change in direct propor-
tion to how much psychic 
energy you can free up 
from your fears. You, like 
all humans , will not know 
bow much you can move 
things until you release 
yo urself. 

Your ability to be honest

I want to tell what friends 
I have that I am turni ng

with them. My history has 
provided me a good over-

They don't know how te,

fears . And as is often the 
case, I freeze and often 
become frustrated because 
I often lack the resources 
within me to respond in a 
way that I feel would not 
"blow them out." In short, 
I do not know how to deal 
with a phenomenon that is 
slowly overtaking me. My 
personal relationships must 
stand up to constant 
questioning in my head. I 
have speculated on death 
and its attractiveness as an 
answer comes and goes. 
Present ly it is gone and the 
new alternative exists as 
traveling for a while. But I 
must still deal with a socie-
ty whose views toward 
homoS'exual ity often 
smacks of unwarranted 
resistance. I am trying but 
would like a little un-
derstanding from my 
friends . My road is blurred

Observations 
Dear World ilnd U.C.S,D., 

I guess the idea of 
"defense" for the gay com-
munity has been buzzing 
around in people's minds 
for some time, judging by 
the fact that Th e Reader 
andTT ea c h published 
semi-neutral art icles upon 
the subject last week. I was 
nei th e r appalled nor 
enligh tened by either on e 
o f t h es e ar t icle syours 
ask ing for a calm"let it be" 
atti tud e, or t h e ot h er 
flee ting ly to uchin g upon 
the social aspect of gay life. 

continued on page 5 

Continued from pilse 4 
Anyway, I don't think 
"defense" or condemna-
tion of the gay segment of 
society needs espouse-
ment ; a debate cannot 
begin without facts, and 
facts start with the truth of 
observation. 

Because of my life 
philosophy (as yet 
awkwardly still forming), I 
really don't find heterosex-
uality or homosexuality to 
be existent they are labels, 
to be sure, but of what, I 
think remains to be seen. 
J., you asked for an opi-
nion. Well here's mine: 

I am neither a homosex-
ual nor a heterosexual I am 
just sexual. I believe we 
learn to respond to a very 
reinforcing stimulus: sex, 
as an essential curiousity in 
us all. Sometimes sexual 
encounters are forced 
upon us, at other times we 
must initiate them; either 
way, we respond as we 
have learned to respond. If 
the heterosexual finds 
reward and reinforcement 
in the opposite sex, the 
homosexual finds the 
same, or at least a similar 
sense of belonging with 
those of his or her own sex. 
Some individuals have built 
up fears regarding either 
their own or the opposite 
sex. I feel this is a sad 
c ommentary on the 
limi ting nature or the 
restrictive force upon us 
from society, gripping our 
parents and our customs 
worst of all. Finally, in this 
aspect of sexual encounter, 
I feel we are all capable of a 
sexua l experience with 
anyone, regardless of sex 
and maybe should ex-
perience both sexes, but 
that's your decision. 

Perhaps some of our 
audience would like "-
qualifications" as to my 
knowledge. Just who am I 
to claim such (another) 
neu tral doctrine l I am 
speaking from the stand-
point of observation . I have 
visited gay bars as well as 
"normal" barsbeing under 
twenty-one makes this es-
pecially difficult to satisfy 
my curiosity. Amazingly 
enough, gay bars are much 
more difficult to enter . 
You see, they also exhibit 
the fear of society's pursuit. 

counter-tops. According to 
the authprass of the two 
articles in The Reader, she 
did not view any such en-
counterswell, neither have 
I. Again amazingly, few 
people in either straight or 
gay bars find ex hibitionism 
exciting or worthwile. 
"Gays" as well as 
"straights" do not condone 
excessive public affection. 
Perhaps this might speak 
for the universality o f 
morals between people, 
not just heterogenous or 
homogenous groups. 

I also speak from the 
standpOint of association. 
Yes, I know and enjoy both 
those who claim 
themselves straight and 
those who claim the selves 
gay. However, wherever I 
go, I try to delimit these 
types and express myself as 
a being, who happens to 
be a man, and who 
believes in loving people : 
individuals, not types or 
catagories. Hi-sexual, the 
audience claims . Is that 
what you call itl I'll have to 
remember that . My 
associations with men and 
women have been nei ther 
all social or all sexual. As an 
individual, I find sex to be 
only a sidelight of sociality . 
Neither is it an act nor a 
commitment, for both of 
these can fade in memory. 
To me, ' sex is a very in-
timate expression to the 
other individual involved-
of what it is an expression, 
a part of a commitment, or 
just mutual understanding, 
is determined by the peo-
ple involved. If one wants 
an act : masturbate; if one 
wants commitment: sign a 
contract (even this isn't 
binding). I hope the 
audience doesn't assume 
'me to condemn the pur-
poses of sex or the facets of 
sex, or excuse the expres-
sion, the angles of sex but 
people I believe should 
define what it means only 
for themselves, not others. 

That last statement is the 
crux of : :Let It Be" and 
articles like it. People, ac-
cording most ostensively to 
this generation, are sup-
posed to do their own 
thing, their own way. J. did 
it and continues to do so. 
I'm doing it right now. 
Thank God, or whatever, 
that this generation 
succeeds the previous one! 
If ever there was a score of 

years dedicated to civil 
liberties, this better be it. 
Our parents made us finan -
cially liberated, let's com-
plete the picture. let's get 
off our asses and accept 
individuals as they present 
themselves and their 
ideals. I really don't think 
pity, forgiving or forgetting 
enters the picture, because 
somehow with all those at-
titudes, knowledge 
becomes lost and ig-
norance is once again bliss. 

Who do you make it 
with? I really don't care. I 
don't entertain "hopes" of 
making It with you, either. 
Loving, though, is another 
matter, but I won't get 
started on that again, for 
fear that you might mis-
interpret. 

J. I hope you don ' t find 
me too obnoxious, but I'm 
going to sign my name. I 
guess I ca n do this because 
my sexual encounters in-
clude women, and my 
position isn't as " radical" 
(misunderstood), although 
it is an opinion of a minori-
ty. About your homosex-
uality? That's your 
business, as we both know. 
About my homosexuality? 
I' m not. And I'm not 
heterosexual, nor bisexual. 
I'm just plain sexual. I'd be 
lying if I denied it, and I

J. Offers More 
InSight On 
Homosexuality' 
Editor, Triton Times : 

First of all I would like to 
thank you for publishing 
my letter in your Jan . 9 
edition : however I must 
take issue with your selec-
tion of a headline to ac-

company the article "An 
Alternate Lifestyle : Let It 
Be." The use of the word 
"alternative" implies a 
choice - a choice which is 
not avallble to the 
homosexual, who has no 
control over the forces 
which make him a 
homosexual. Furthermore 
homosexuality is a dismal 
existence, which I do not 
believe anyone could 
select by choice. Many a 
gay individual can fool 
himself into believing that 
he is leading a "normal", 
happy life but sooner or 
later he realizes his life is 
shit. The main problem is, 
as I noted in my previous 
letter, society's fear, ig-
norance, and even hatred, 
of the homosexual ; it is 
ignorance which forms the 
fou ndat ion of the other 
two. Please note however 
that the homosexual is 
often just as ignorant of the 
subject as the heterosex-
ual ; therefore in an 
attempt to remedy this 
situation I propose two 
questions : 1) What is a 
homosexual? and 2) How 
does a homosexual 
become a homosexual? 

The first question is not 
set forth as an insult to your 
intelligence, the definition 
of the term presents a very 
real problem as it covers a 
large expanse of male to 
male relationships (I will 
leave the discussion of 
lesbianism for a more 
qualified individual than 
myself) . Technically the 
range extends from a men-

To hazard a guess, I would 
say gay bars are harassed 
much more than "st raight" 
bars. Some might claim, 
seeing that more men at-
tend gay bars than women, 
that the bars are on police 
"shit lists" due to the com-
modity of men and their

Pandit Pran Nath is the disciple of the late 
Ustad Abdut Waheed Khansahib, 
acknowledged master of the Kirana style 
which was kept pure from master to master for 
600 years. In Indian raga singing details of 
performance style are taught by the gu.ru to 
the disciple who has to repeat a particular 
phrase thousands of ti~es until it be~omes 
part of him. The result IS a pure musIc that 
evokes profound spiritual and emotional reac· 
tion in the listener. Sometimes solo efforts are 
sustained over an hour and a half. After his 
debut in New Delhi, Pran Nath became the 
recognized master of North Indian ragas able 
to evoke perfectly the individual mood of

Young Turkey 
Pam and Michael Rosenthal 

Young Winston is our odds-on 
favorite, over strong competition, for 
turkey of 1972. It is a sorry, bloat~d 
exercise in misplaced hero-worship, 
with no saving graces beyond pleasant 
acting and a minimally literate 
screenplay. Worst of all is the self-
congratulatory tone of the production, 
the air of cultural high-mindedness 
wh ich suggests that seeing the film 
should be as uplifting and edifying as a 
visit to a natural history museum . 

It has that same static, oppressively 
high-brow quality of an early sound film 
in the days when movies were con· 
sidered lowbrow entertainment, and 
the theatre was thought the proper 
place for high art. A producer who s~t 
out to make a film that would cast credit 
on the industry, would make it as much 
like the theatre as possible, relying en-
tirely on the script and wuppressing the 
activity and expressiveness of the 
camera. Not only is Young Wins/on 
outmoded in form, elitist in its preten-
sions, reactionary in its assumption that 
history is the saga of great mens' great 
exploits; it also ignores everything that 
has been learned in the past twenty 
years about the power of the camera to 
tell a story. 

The drama, such as it is, hinges on 
poor Winston's neglect at the hands of 
his idolized father, a witty statesman-
aristocrat , lately fallen from power and 
slowly deteriorating with syphillis. Sir 
Randolph rarely communicates with his 
son, beyond snarling ':,You are. ~y 
greatest diS<lppointment as WInOie 
flunks wretchedly through the elite 
schools and appears well on his way to 
becoming a useless upper class wastrel. 

After his father'S death, Winston com-
pensates for his b?uered eg~ by 
becoming a compulSive overachiever, 
pushy, brass and ambitious, always 

attempting to prove himself to the ghost 
' of his father. In his maiden speech, 
when he reaches Parliament, he 
brilliantly champions the Issue that 
brought about Sir Randolph's political 
downfall. He thereupon says he feels 
"ti red ... but free. It's odd . I feel free" 
and steps from under his father's 
shadow to become the great statesman 
the whole world loves and admires and 
so forth . 

Something might have been done 
with the story, if those involved had 
realized that it was nothing more en-
nobling than a fairy tale, like Cinderalla 
or the Ugly Duckling, in which the 
scorned outcast becomes a prince. But 
they persist in a ponderous, professorial 
approach, never letting us forget that 
we are in the awesome presence of 
budding greatness. So the entire weight 
of the picture rests on our willingness to 
believe that Winston S. Churchill is a 
worthy inspirational figure for young 
and old. 

We are not well enough versed in 
European history to give a well 
documented opinion; but there is a lot 
of evidence in the quotations from 
Churchill recited during the film. 
During an improbable lecture to the 
hoped-for youth market, the script has 
Winston proclaim: "If I could, I would 
say this to young men all over the world-
come onl You must take your places on 
life's fighting line ... You will make mis-
takes, but as long as you are generous 
and true you cannot hurt the world. She 
was made to be wooed and won by 
youthl She has lived and thrived only by 
repeated subjugationsl 

Fortunately, the audience is likely to 
b to deadened by that time to be 
adversely affected by the movie's ad-
vocacy of the central theme of im· 
perialism : that the proper model for 
valiant conduct in history is rape.

Phlo and Eddie Shine 
Phlorescent Leech and Eddie, headed 

by former members of the Mothers of 
Invention and erstwhile Turtles 
musicians headline the first ma jor rock 
concert at UCSD Saturday night, January 
27. Comedian Murray Roman is the 
special guest act. 

Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan are 
the leaders of the Phlo and Eddie group, 
a band known for its excellent 
musicianship and inventive stage com-
edy. They are on the Reprise label with 
their own album, titled "The Phlores-
cent Leech and Eddie," and can also be 
heard on T-Rex's "Electric Warrior" ac-
companying Marc Bolan. 

Zappa fans will recognize some other 
members of the group, notably fuzzy-
faced Don Preston on keyboards and 

Aynsley Dunbar, also an ex· Mayall 
drummer. Bassist Jim Pons and guitarist 
Gary Rowles round out the group. 

Comedian Murray Roman also 
appears on the bill. An ex·Smothers 
Brothers staff writer, he recently 
released an album titled " Busted" in 
which he details jail experiences 
resulting from the confiscation by police 
of a substance resembling brown 
modeling clay. 

"This show isn't to be taken lightly," 
cautions Mark Volman, the heavyweight 
of the group. It promises to be an 
exciting show, so get ready for Phlo and 
Eddis. Tickets are 51.50 for UCSD 
students in advance and $2 for all others 
in advance, available at the Urey Hall 
Box Office, and are available at the door 
for $2.50. 

Menuhin in San Diego 
. Chiilrles Hyde 

Changing from their usual Thursday -
Friday night concert pair due to artist 
availability, the San Diego Symphony 
started 1973 last Monday and Tuesday 
with Yehudi Menuhin, violin soloist. 

The concert opened with J.S.Bach's 
(1685-1750) violin conderto in E major. 
Yehudi Menuhin filled the dual roles of 
soloist a nd conductor; this was the prac-
tice during Bach's time: "Conducting" 
was done by means of signals usually 
given by the first violinist. The small 
orchestra (but huge for Bach's time : 
eighteen violins, six violas, four celli, 
two bass and harpsichord) was obviously 
well rehearsed, as Menuhin's signals 
were few and, happily, discreet. In 
general, the orchestra played well under 
Menuhin's perceptive leadership. It 
hardly needs to be said that Menuhin 
performed in the manner that has made 
his world-famous reputation . 

Although the actual date of composi-
tion is unclear, it w as probably between 
1717 and 1723. The first movement is 
built upon the risi ng E major triad, and is 
fairly staight foward in development. 
The second movement, and Adagio, is a 
free chaconne against a persistent bass 
figure. Mr. Me nu hin was at his 
evening's peak duri ng this movement, 
with the orchestra supporting him in 
beauty. The final movement is an alter-
nating series of a repeated theme and 
four variations: the theme presented 
tutti, the variations by the soloist. 

The second piece was the violin con-
cert by W.A. Mozart (1756-1791) in A 
major, K.219, the "Turkish" during 
which Peter Eros joined the orchestra as 
conductor. This Is Mozart's best·known 
violin concerto; he probably wrote 
seven or eight, of which five are 
thoroughly authenticated. He com-
posed It In 1n5 for a personal perlor-

mance for The Archbishop of Sa'izberg. 
To display his own virtuosity on the 
violin, Mozart included six cadenzas, 
with four in the last movement. The 
Monday performance had s6me rough 
spots that were polished Tuesday night. 

After intermission, the San Diego 
Symphony played Robert Schumans 
(1810-1856) Third Symphony in E flat, 
Op.97, the "Rhenish." This was written 
in 1850, and was inspired by the 
Rhineland, reflected in the title. The first 
movement was played with great 
rhythmic drive and precision. I would 
have perferred the second movement a 
little faster, but it was handled well at 
that speed. The third movement, Nicht 
Schnell, is a lovely miniafure only 54 
measures long; it resembles perhaps 
more closely than any other movement 
a piano piece, Schumann's usual 
medium. The fourth movement, often 
considered a prelude to the fifth and 
final movement, is a slow piece inspired 
by the Cathedrial At Cologne. The finale 
is boisterous, loud, and too long. 

Schumann is called, even by the sym· 
pathetic, one of the worst orchestrators. 
Conductors are left with the choice of 
rewriting the symphony of ignoring the 
original dynamics. I wish Eros had done 
slightly more of either, for the 
symphony turned out to be quite a 
showpiece for horns, but only because 
they were all that could be heard; this 
was worsened by the fact that it was not 
one of the brass section's best nights. 
The symphony was given a rather lively 
performance, if somewhat loud and 
sprawling in the outer movements. An 
interesting discussion concerns to what 
extent Schumann had become insane 
when he wrote this symphony. I leave 
the answer to my reader to decide for 
themselves after listening.

teachers are biased, but 
that they are unaware of 
black aesthetic philosophy. 
Blacks are of an oral rather 
than a written tradition, 
and this is reflected in the 
quality of their presence 
on stage . An effective 
workshop must emphasize 
verbal and non-verbal 
language and movement 
patterns which are ex-
pressive of black people, 
and all disciplines such as 
history , anthropology, 
sociology and music must 
be brought in to properly 
focus the black experience. 
Drama not only records 
major crises in human 
history, it often identifies 
cause and effect and 
suggests solutions to these 
problems; and proper in-
vestigation of rei event 
methods of training in 
black drama can be in-
valuable." 

The .. ter Too lsobted 
Dr. Gaffney has a clear vi-
sion of what he believes is 
needed in today's theater 
to reinvigorate it as an 
effective form of expres-
sion for blacks as well as 
whites. "What is . wrong 
with American theater is 
that it is too isolated, too 
far removed from grass 
roots people. The move 
must be made away from 
commercialism and toward 
the concept of community-
recreational theater 
something that will reach 
more people to become an 
influential part of their 
lives. Most people today go 
to movies, leaving the 
legitimate theater to the 
middle classes, and that 
should not be the case. 
Significant drama should 
reach all the people." Skip

27 Meets 

Fencers on Longest Streak 
UCSD's fine fencing team has been up to its old tricks 

again they've been winning and winning and winning. 
In fact, after las't Friday's wins over Cal State Long Beach 
and Cal State Los Angeles, the Tritons are the proud 
owners of a 27 meet winning streak. This amazing feat 
has extended over the last four years and is the longest 
intercollegiate string of wins in UCSD history. It goes 
without saying that coach Jim White's white gladiators 
are the most successful sports program that this school 
has ever seen. 

Their latest escapades started a little before Christ-
mas when they easily defeated our cross-town Big 
Brother at San Diefo State 19-8. The next victim was a 
disappointingly weak Cal State Fullerton team which 
fell 18-9. And the fall quarter's action ended with a 
sound defeat of UC Santa Barbara 25-2. While the 
men 's team was doing so well, the women were 
beating San Diego State and Santa Barbara, but losing 
to Fullerton 

Great team depth is one of the main reasons the 
Tritons are so powerful. Not only do they have strong 
fir.st men, but strong second and third men as well . 
This fact is most notable when one looks at the 

records of the team members against State, Fullerton 
and Santa Barbara. I n the saber event (minus the first

Unload On State 

Doug Reanan 
The sun shone brightly and the air stood warm when 

the new UCSD ruggers marched out on the field and 
thoroughly trounced San Diego State's newly-groomed 
second team. The adrenalin must have been flowing in 
the Triton ruggers with their second sight of State 
uniforms. UCSD took an early lead with a boot by Jeff 
'Witless' Wustman after a well-executed break led by 
new stars Tom 'The Mover' Wright and Brad 'Tu rkey' 
Tebo. The joy was short-lived as the first-string State 
kicker, demoted especially for this game along with a 
few others, tied the score on a penalty kick. 

But the UCSD neophytes kept pressing, and it paid 
off as Kevin 'Sad Sack' Sadin found himself with the ball 
in the end zone following a blocked kick after a five-
yard seru m. Witless easily converted, but State came 
back just before halftime from a 20 yard line out. 
Failure to convert left UCSD with a slim 9-7 lead. 
' 'The .backs'must have read up on rugby finesse as 

Brad 'The Streak' Iwanaga brought a cheer from his 
lovely hugger when he broke through State's defenses 
and scooted by their first-string fullback for a score. 
Witless did the job again and converted to make it 15-7. 
Turkey Tebo, seeing how easily State broke away, all 
but forgot his notes on how to get past the fullback, as 
he was stopped on the 2. Mover Wright, trailing, 
picked up the dball and three State ruggers, and 
carried them four yards for a score. This time, though, 
Witless failed to convert while giving a big smile for the 
audience.

him a kiss per score ( SEEKING MORE POINTS,

Harriers Ready 
For New Year 

Track team coach Andy Skief is enthusiastic about 
this year's track team so far . Skief has coached here for 
th last five years and has be n impressed by the initial 
turnout for the track team and th n a little disap-
point d by departure of many of his team members 
due to academic press ure or the lure of another port. 

When asked whether he thought the lure of 
scholarships would be a good way to draw some track 
stars, Coach Skief said that he could work with or 
without scholarships, but added that his philosophy is 
that athl t s should be self-motivated. 

The track team's returning members, as of now, 
includ Tom Philps, Rudy Meyers, Dave Robinson, 
Mark Robertson, Howard Long, and possibly Kirk 
N well. The most hopeful new members include two 
48 flat quarter mil rs: B. J. Scales and Craig Mitchell . 
The teams best events appear to be the mile relay, the 
440 relay and the weight events which include the 
shotput and discus. The team also, for the moment 
anyway, has good depth in the middle distance and 
distance runs. Weak points are the long jump, tripl 
jump, and the pole vault. 

The UCSD track team participates in the NAIA 
District III League. It is also affiliated with the NCAA 
sma ll college division but does not participate in it. The 
fa rthest the team travels for meets is to Los Angeles. 

The track season begins here February 24, against 
Azuza Pacific. Practic ,in pr paration for the season, is 
daily from 3-5pm daily on the intramural field . Practic 
will be moved to th track Februaru 1. Coach Skief 
wants to encourage anyone int rest d to go out to 
practice. 

quarter services of Dick Sax), Ji Eller was 9-1, Ty 
Sebasstian 6-3, and Steve Heave l also 6-3. In the epee 
event, Howard Eno, Jim Miller, and captain John 
Helmich were all 7-2. The foil team saw captain Mike 
Jones going undefeated with a 9-0 record with team 
members Darryel Devinney and Stan Robinson recor-
ding 6-3 records and John Meyers ending up 3-0. 

The girls' team was lead by Dia ne Naffke 6-3 followed 
by Peggy Hollweg and Patty Neal, both 5-4. The girls' 
congregate is also looking forward to the return of 
Terri Bueshini and Susan Hillary, both returning after a 
quarter's lay-off. 

This quarter's fencing action was befun last Friday 
with a dual meet against Cal State Long Beach and Cal 
State LA. True to the form established fall quarter, the 
Tritons soundly defeated LA 26-10 and Long Beach 22-
14. 

Against LA the foil squad of Mike Jones, Darryel 
Devi,nney, and Stan Robinson all went undefeated 
with 3-0 records each: Saber, with the return of dashing 
debonnaire Dick Sax, won their event 5-4 and the epee 
squad saw Howard Ero and John Helmich each having 
spotless records of 3-0while Steve Murk went 2-1 . The 
women unfortunately didn 't do as well, losing their 
event 4-5. 

The Long Beach match was a little bit closer than 
expected, but with no ral threat. The epee squad won 
7-2, as did the saber team with an identical 7-2 record. 
Foil congregate won their match 6-3. The women had 
an unfortunate day and lost to Long Beach 2-7. 
Outstanding in this match were John Helmich, Dick Sax 
and Darryel Devinney who all went 3-0. 

After his 27th consecutive team win in dual competi-
tion, Coach White is very pleased with his fencers. He 
feels that in every sense of the word, they are a good, 
solid team of hard working individuals. He also at-
tributes the success to the fa ct that there isn't any 
super-star but a number of fine, fine fencers just one 
step below the 'super' level. 

The team will have a bye this weekend and return to 
action January 2628 at the All -Cal tournament in Santa 
Cruz. The following week the Tritons will host the 
largest fencing tournament west of the Mississippi in 
the UCSD Invitational. We'll have more information 
on that event in a future arti~e . 

Handball Contest 
Next Week 

. . 

Hey, all you handball players out there who thought 
you were the only ones being snubbed by the In-
tramural Department, have we ever got good news for 
youl There is going to be a handball tournament 
starting Thursday, January 25th at 6:00 pm. Sign-ups 
will be in the Physical Education Office, and the 
deadline is Tuesday. As a special incentive, the top four 
players in the tourney will be going to the All-Cal 
Tournament at Irvine. 

The coed kickkball captain's meeting has been 
scheduled for Wednesday at 4:00, and then on 
Thursday at 3:00 there will be a cil'ptain's meeting for 
men's one-pitch softball . This is a new intramural 
activity designed to keep some of UCSD's true die-
hard softball fanatics happy until spring. 

For details on any of the above, or any questions 
abou t the intramural program in gehera l, contact Lee 
or any of his assistants at X-2283, or stop by the

And At The Door 
2-5 Tue .·Fri. 

If you've happened by UCSD's quaint 100,000 gallon 
aquarium in the afternoon lately, you've probably 
noticed about a baker's dozen worth of bodies 
thrashing around the pool, mostly going from one end 
to the other, and then back again, as though they were 
either searching the bottom for a contact lens - or a 
way out. These people are not to be confused with one 
of Bert's classes, gang; that's the good 01' swim team, 
the Triton Aqua Truckers ... hereafter referred to as TAT. 

The first thing we have to clarify about TAT is that a 
few of those bodies on any given afternoon are, in all 
probability, not card-carrying members. That is to say 
there may be some old timers just cruising through an 
afternoon washing out their eyes and sinuses. Or there 
may even be an infiltrator from the distaff team, the 
Triton Inundated Tomatoes, hereafter referred to as .. . 
the need and news arises. Let it suffice to say that 
before reaching any conclusions, look closely as you 
walk by to be sure you don't mistake a TIT for TAT, so 
to speak. 

The team has been cleverly honed by Coach Gary 
Becker down to only the ten swimmers and two divers 
who bother to come to practice, enabling concentra-
tion which might otherwise be lost in a confusing 
multitude of bodies. On the team, half are freshmen 
and three are sophomores, dwhich sort of rules out 
competing in any X-rated meets this year, but perhaps 
indicates hope for the future. 

Two back from last year's squad are Eric Redemann 
in the sprints (that means he moves quickly), and John 
Ford, who holds the 100 back record, wh ich is an 
accomplishment since this is only the first time he's 
come back. Everyone else is for all practical purposes 
new but experienced from previous competition. The 
water polo team donated Ralph Ausman and Alex 
Foskett, both frosh, and Pixie, who is a second year 
uncertainty. While Alex is working hard on the flu, 
Ralph is perfecting his one-speed perpetual motion 
stroke for any races over 10 miles. and Pixie, well 
remember how he impotently threw the ball around in 
the fall? Well , with no hair on his chest to slow him 
down, things are looking up for Pix. Of course, 
everything has to look up for Pi x when he's standing on 
blocks two feet high. 

Ah, yes. Blocks, flips , in, out, pull , jump, roll , repeats, 
lanes, gutters, flags, SPEED ... swimming, like any sport, 
has its own jargon. Perhaps in the near future we' ll 
define some of these things to make swimmingg as 
crystal clear as water polo was made last quarter. We'll 
also be able to assess those people on the team we so 
carefully ignored, because Saturday Cal Poly Pomona 
will reveal just who can do what and how fast . And let'~ 
not forget the divers . There will hopefully only be two 
people taking dives for the team this year, but it's a 
respectably tough schedule. Only time will tell , so we'll 
put three watches on Lane 4 and just wait to see if we 
get JD'd, or if the men's team is really starting to 
develop as much as the Tomatoes have.

Chi e In the 
Aft~!!!!l0n 

Eric Rohmer could just 
be a trick on film cultists. 

Per~aps the reclusi'Je, ur-
bane director doesn 't even 
exi~. A conspiracy of film-
makers could have con-
structed his "Six Moral 
Tales" as a huge canard on 
New York reviewers, a Car-
diff Giant left for the gulli-
ble to accept as genuine. 
"Chloe in the Afternoon," 
the last of the series, was 
cleverly planted as the 
most absurd and trivial of 
the lot. Who would dare 
whisper this late in the. 
game that the films are 
rubbish, and we've been 
hadl 

"Chloe," briefly, con-
cerns an abortive quasi-
sexual tease between a 
tiresome married shlepp 
and a confused free spirit 
who plays more games 
than Parker Brothers. Ber-
nard Verley as Frederic 
projects the kind of fussy, 
selfsatisfied Big Boy that 
Richard Benjamin does so 
often in this country. He's 
the fat-palmed sexist with a 
pompous belief in his own 
supreme rationalitythe prig 
you love to hate. 

Frederic's icily proper 
young wife is never 
defined as fully human; 
she's an idealized 
bourgeois wife and mother 
whom Frederic admires as 
he might a rare vase. 
Rohmer completes his 
ever-ready triangle with 
the French model and pop 
superstar Zouzou . Zouzou 
deserves at least a 
paragraph all her own. 

Zouzou has shattered 
the time zone. She 
emerges here as the rein-
carnated Daisy Clover, or 
maybe Liza Minelli's 
Pookie, or better still, Julie 
Christie's cameo in "Billy 
Liar ." The women are 
idealized "free spirits," 
bohemians who tantalize 
the male imagination. They 
aren't liberated in the 
current use of the word; 
they are apparently 
without politics . They 
aren't especially self-
assured, or strong, or even 
particularly rebellious. Just 
happy, nutty, carefree, 
willful and terribly attrac-
tive. 

Zouzou, playing Chloe, 
carries that off like a load 
of bricks. To participate in 
a Rohmer film, you must 
talk incessantly. You must 
intellectualize everything 
that happens to you. You 
don't feel, see, hear or 
smellyou talk. Somehow 
between puffs on a con-
tinuous chain of cigarettes, 
Zouzou talks a blue streak, 
intellectualizing everyone 
of her carefu lly studied 
bohemian nutty actions. 
The contradicti.) n in 
characteriza tio n seems 
happily lost on Rohmer. 

The single most apparent 
and continous aSi=e~t of 
"Chloe in the Afte 'noon" 
is the quality of the acting.

has anyone seen such em-
barrassing ineptitude put 
on 35mm film. Bernard 
Verley deserves most of the 
credit for contributing the 
lion's share. Verley's 
attempt at domestic humor 
around the house is 
physically painful at first 
then slowly eases to a dull 
nausea not unlike 
seasickness. Francoise 
Verley and Zouzou are 
similarly uncomfortable in 
their roles. The effect is a 
curious itching sensation, 
as though the actors could 
not remember their lines, 
but persisted regardless 
before a grieved and 
sweating audience. 

Because of the inep-
titude in execution, it is 
difficult to deal with the 
serious theme of "Chloe". 
As with the other five 
moral tales, this film 
presents a man who is in 

, love with one woman but is 
drawn to another, whom 
he finally rejects. 

Whether these are 
lessons from the Catechism 
or bourgeois safety 
measures wouldn't make 
much difference . The 
message arrives with all the 
zi ng of a maxim from 
"Poor Richard". 

The implied attitudes in 
"Ch loe" are profoundly 
sexist. Frederic daydreams 
the most pathetic adoles-
cent power fantasies over 
women, flipping a magic 
eye amulet at them to 
produce a slavish response 
to his overtures I Frederic's 
wife is the perfect 
homemaker and mother, 
Rohmer even allowing her 
the liberty of a teaching 
career. Zouzou, on the 
other hand, considers her 
possibilities from among 
model, secretary, waitress, 
salesgirl and barkeep. The 
half-hour or so of office 
patter between Frederic 
and his secretaries might 
occur any morning at the 
Bank of Americabut who 
needs to pay good money 
to witness itl 

And the imph ation that 
Frederic is proper and 
chaste in marriage, while 
Ch loe as free female is 
both temptress and fair 
game describes the usual 
double-standard. 

The question, finally , 
becomes what in hell is 
Rohmer or whoever is 
making these films up tol 
The characters are lifeless, 
passionless, cerebral, 
remote, and excruciatingly 
boring. Pauline Kael gives 
the maestro the benefit of 
the boubt when she com-
mints that he has "diddled 
over a small idea too long."

Continued from JNle 5 • 
tal relationship 
(comradeship) to a physical 
love (sodomy). Because of 
the vagueness of term and 
because of society'S 
prudishness, confusion 
reigns - even among 
homosexuals - as to a 
definition of the term, 
however according to Dr. 
Anna Freud (the daughter 
of Sigmund) the object of 
masturbation fantasies can 
be used as the final 
criterion of sexual orienta-
tion; that is if you are male 
and members of the same 
sex are consistently the 
object of your masturba-
tion fantasies then you are 
a homosexual. 

The second question is 
much more confusing and 
controversial; it is still far 
from settled and the object 
of a fair amount of research 

. (though not enough) . 
Possible answers are con-

fined basically to two 
sources : 1) biology 
(specifically genetics) and 
2) family environment or a 
combination of both. The 
genetic explanation was 
(and still is) quite appealing 
for many homosexuals who 
just accepted their situa-
tion as the result of fate. 
However this explanation 
implies that there is no 
possibility of change, 
which is not true as it is 
possible to completely 
"cure" some homosexuals 
of homosexuality. 

What appears to be the 
more plausible ex-
planations are those 
relating to family environ-
ment and there is evidence 
to bear this out - I would 
direct the interested reader 
to Dr. Irving Bieber's 
massive and important 
work entitled Homosex-
uality published by Ran-
dom House in 1962 - Dr. 
Bieber's research was con-
ducted over a decade by 
eight psychoanylysts and a 

Rug by. .. continued from page 9 
Once again Witless failed and the score stood 23-7. The 
Streak, still trying to score pranced and danced down 
for a try, but a slow ref declared it no good as a 
frustrated Iwanaga glanced toward his hugger . 

The UCSD youngsters wanted more glory and Witless 
redeemed himself by completing a very difficult penal-
ty kick. But State, feeling insulted . by Witle~s' glee 
pressed until th~y scored and dcontlnued therr press, 
hoping for a late-in-the-game comeback. But UCSD 
perked up and buried the State onslaught on the 5. 

To end the game, a converted b-baller Dave Wright, 
demonstrated his running, darting, and plowing ability 
as he made it a point to jock-out every State rugger on 
the field, back-tracking to jock the ones he had 
overlooked as he ran 150 yards for his first try. The 
game ended UCSD on top 30-11.. . .. 

But that was only the beginning of the festlvttles. 
Another green UCSD team faced a well-drilled team 
from UCLA and was defeated 13-0. The Tritons showed 
desire, but it was only a matter of time before UCLA 
hried to win by kicking every penalty kick, but soon 
they realized that they didn't have a kicker and went 
back to their old strategy of outplaying their opponent. 
UCSD played well, but stood around at the wrong 
times while UCLA saw their opportunities and struck 
fast . the roughness of the game produced a few 
injuries, and UCSD sustained their share as veteran 
Gyro received a concussion to his derriere. 

Then it was time for the big game of the day when 
UCSD's I's came out against UCLA's awesome I's, but 
the Triton ruggers forgot to take notes from the UCSD 
neophyte Ill's earlier. The second half proved fatal for 
San Diego and our ruggers were squashed 42-3. Even 
the LA ruggers respected the first half play of UCSD, 
resorting to some razzle-dazzle for their first half 
scores. The LA ruggers complimented John Ringwood's 
great defensive playing, as time and again he single-
handedly stymied UCLA attacks. But he could not stop 
all UCLA's constant attacking, and at the half, LA 
walked off with a comfortable 18-3 lead. 

As often happens when playing against UCLA, UCSD 
morale dropped, and LA found it easier to score. But 
our fearless leader, 'Old Man' Sertic, trying to hasten 
his retirement tried to run over a couple of over-fed 
and over-exercised UCLA animals. He didn't get too 
far. But even after seeing this fearlessness still etched in 
Sertic's face after 450 Ibs. of beef got off him, the San 
Diego troops were not inspired and the game ended, 
none too soon, 42-3. 

One more game was played between San Diego 
State's I's and UCLA's II's, but as the beer disappeared 
from the field to Surfside, so did our faithful writer and 
the Triton ruggers. 

psychologist . I must 
emphasize that this work 
does not represent the 
final answer however I per-
sonally felt that it is on the 
right track as it accu rately 
describes the family situa-
tion in which I was brought 
up. 106 homosexuals were 
used as subjects and there 
were 100 heterosexual 
comparisons. What follows 
are a few of the facts which 
appeared. 

A disproportionally large 
number of the homosex-
uals were only children or 
only sons. Their mothers 
tended to get along .poorly 
with women and if they 
had daughters they tended 
not to favor them. The 
mother was described by 
Dr. Bieber as a "close bin-
ding intimate" or CBI. The 
CBI mother bound one son 
to her and monopolizing 
his attention and desire she 
inhibited him with an-
tisexual attitudes. 
"Pu rita nical" and "frigid" 
are common adjectives 
used by the homosexuals 
in describing their 
mothers. The CBI mother 
generally babied and over-
procted the homosexual. 

It is commonly thought 
that a weak father figure is 
responsible for homosex-
ual attitudes appearing in 
male offspring. This ap-
parently is not the case, in 
fact the opposite would 
appear to be more correct. 
Of 94 fathers (of homosex-
uals) studied 79 were 
emotionally detached from 
their sons. The father had 
severe male rivalry 
problems and acted them 
out with the son; if he had 
more than one son the 
homosexual one was not 
favored. So the homosex-
ual had won a monopoly 
on his mother's love but 
failed to gain his father's 
warmth and protec-
tiveness. A large number of 
the fathers actively helped 
crushed their son's 
masculinity by being open-
ly hostile, rejecting and 
minimizing. Attempts at 
assertion on the part of the 
son were stifled with out-
bursts of anger, and failure 
was underscored by scorn. 
The boys feared their 
fathers. 

The overprotectiveness 
of the mother and the 
father's disinterest or con-
tempt made the boy feel 
inadequate with other 
children and stifled his sex-
ual and non-sexual 
aggressiveness thus 
precluding a "normal" 
childhood. 

The close mother - son 
bond placed the 
prehomosexual son in 
competition' with his father 
thereby making the son 
proport ionately afraid of 

his ' father's retaliation, 
leading to a suppression of 
masculinity. 

His parents' strict sexual 
and non-sexual 
prohibitions reinforced 
each other, causing acute 
anxiety. The child's fears 
were projected to external 
sources, phobias being a 
common manifestation of 
such fears, the result sex-
ually was a phobic reaction 
to the female, a defensive 
avoidance rising from fear 
of the consequences of 
heterosexuality. A separate 
study by two members of 
Dr. Bieber's team pro-
jected this anxiety into the 
homosexual's adolescence 
and were able to neatly 
define two groups: 1) 
Hypermasculine, those 
keeping up a masculine, 
heterosexual front. These 
individuals experienced 
extreme anxiety, many 
were preoccupied with 
body building, aggressive 
sports and their image as a 
great (heretosexual) and 
lover, 2) effeminate, these 
boys had no apparent con-
flict about being homosex-
ual as long as they could be 
effeminate. (Bieber 
believes effeminacy to be a 
statement of non-
aggression on the part of 
the homosexuaL) 

Bieber concluded that 
every homosexual is a 
"Iatent" heterosexual; 
there appeared to be 
evidence of heterosexual 
striving within the 
homosexuals of the study 
of 1/2 of them had 
heterosexual dreams 
whereas only 1/4 of the 
heterosexual comparisons 
had homosexual dreams. 
Homosexua lity therefore 
appeared to be a phobia -
a fear of the female 
(genitals) meant to cover a 
fear of heterosexual asser-
tion. 

The above represents the 
"classic" pattern found by 
Dr. Bieber, the CBI mother 
and the detached or absent 
father - however there 
were of course variations 
and exceptions and the 
argument developed is 
much more complicated 
than I have presented it. 

And now to contradict 
myself, earlier I said that 
the homosexual has no 
choice open to him, this is 
true in that he has no con-
trol over the environment 
which makes him a 
homosexual (I hope this is 
clear to you); he does 
however have control over 
the manner in which he 
reacts to the situation. A 
complete sexual reorienta-
tion is possiblt:. for some 
homosexuals and .this will 
be the topic of my next 
letter. J.

To All Ruelle Students. 
During the hll Quarter the 
Faculty reduced . the total 
number of courses re-
quired for graduation in 
Revelle from 48 to 46 
courses. In the POISt bec.ause 
Revelle's requirement was 
higher than the UCSO 
Senate minimum for the 
B.A., the College allowed 

' extra degree credit which 
did not show on the 
Registrar's transcript of 
record, for certain courses 
such as 3 unit graduate 
classes, courses where the 
credit had been raised from 
one course to 1'/, courses, 
etc. Effectively immediately 
the College will discon-
tinue this practice. A 
Revelle student may now 
be graduated as soon as he 
completes 46 courses (any 
fraction over 180.0 units on 
the Registrar 's official 
record card will be con-
sidered the 46th course), 
has announced B.A. can-
didacy, and has met all 
college and major re-
quirements. (EI) 
Dr. Gerald Christeller, of
