May revision makes cuts to 
CA colleges, city of San Diego 

By MAlNETTE FEDERIS " 
GAlLLE FAURE 
Senior Staff Writers 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
May revi ion of the state budget, 
is lied on May 13, promised no 
new taxes and included a wide 
array of cuts, including $1.3 bil-
lion less to local government and 
$660 million less to higher educa-
tion, including the University of 
California, as outlined in a previ -
ously brokered compact agree-
ment with the governor. 

The $102 .8 billion revised 
budget is $3 .7 billion larger than 
the governor's $99.1 billion 
January proposal. The new budget 
avoided cuts to healthcare origi-
nally proposed. 

Major cuts include $2 billion 

less to primary and secondary edu-
cation and $476 million in cuts to 
prisons. 

The University of California's 
budget will be cut from $2 .9 bil-
lion to $2 .67 billion. The May 
revi ion replicated the cuts to the 
UC system outlined in the com-

. pact agreement announced on 
May II , which included 14-per-
cent hikes to undergraduate 
tuition and 20-percent hikes for 
graduate students. 

The UC Board of Regents is 
scheduled to vote on 2004-05 fee 
levels at its May 19 meeting. 

"We do believe that this com-
ing budget year will still include 
some pain for the university and 
even in the university community, 
because the state is still facing a 
budget crisis," UC spokesman

Brown anniversary 

Attorney discusses inequality 
in public school system 

OM! Ung/Guanicm 
Pest lAd present Education rights attorney Mary T. Hernandez spoke about 
history and modern-day repercussions of Brown v. Boord of Education. 

ByUSAMAK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Marking the 50th anniversary 
of the Supreme Court decision 
Brown v. Board of Education, edu-
cation rights attorney Mary T. 
Hernandez argued that resegre-
gation has occurred over the past 
decade in public schools in a May 
14 lecture sponsored by Earl 
Warren College. 

Warren College Provost 
David Jordan preceded 
Hernandez's speech by emphasiz-
ing the importance of the case to 
American history and to the col-
lege'S own namesake. 

"No event is more significant 

than the Brown v. Board of 
Education . decision in [Earl 
Warren's] Supreme Court justice 
tenure," Jordan said. "It was little 
short of a miracle .. . and it really 
placed him firmly on the national 
political map as a major figure in 
20th-century American history." 

Hernandez described the evo-
lution of the historical "separate 
but equal" doctrine, which was 
upheld in 1896 with Pltssy v. 
Ferguson and used to segregate 
whites and blacks in public set-
tings. In 1954, the Warren Court 
declared the doctrine unconstitu-
tional in the Brown case and

Brad Hayward sajd. "We still did 
get most cuts outlined back in 
January, but thankfully they're not 
any larger." 

The revision also sti pulates 
that the state will increase Cal 
Grant funding in order to cover 
the proposed 14-percent under-
graduate fee increase. This fund -
ing was not included in the gover-
nor 's original proposal in January. 

"The commitment to cover the 
increase by Cal Grants is a big 
help," UCSD Financial Aid Office 
Director Vince De Anda said. 

However, De Anda was disap-
pointed with the governor's pro-
posal to redirect 20 to 33 percent 
of fees back into financial aid, 
explaining that the return-to-aid

UCSD prof. reexamines 
theory of relativity 
Laser pulse sent to the 
moon will test gravity 

By DEENA AL SHAm 
Senior Staff Writer 

Thomas Murphy, a physics 
professor at UCSD, is one of the 
masterminds behind an experi-
ment that has a chance of rewrit-
ing the theory of relativity or, at 
the very least, examining the 
workings of gravity. 

Murphy is currently heading 
an experiment that will send a 
laser pulse out to the moon to test 
fundamental gravity. The process 
is estimated to take approximate-
ly 2.5 seconds. By timing this to a 
trillionth of a second and dividing 
by the speed of light, an exact 
measurement of the distance to 
the moon should be found. 

According to Murphy, when a 
scientist comes up with a theory 
of gravity, specific predictions can 
be made about how the solar sys-
tem works and moves. 

"If you define the initial posi-
tions and velocity of all the plan-
ets, you should be able to run the 
clockwork according to that the-

ory and see how things should 
move from there on," Murphy 
said. 

The (:xperiment was first put 
in motion in 1999, when Murphy 
contacted Christopher Stubbs, 
now a Harvard professor, at the 
University of Washington. 

"He [had] listed off about a 
dozen thjngs he was involved in, 
and at the very end of the list he 
said, 'don't laugh, but I'm think-
ing of doing this project in lunar 
rearranging.' I was immediately 
captivated," Murphy said. 

Since 1999, the focus has been 
on getting adequate funding to 
do the project. The experiment 
had received initial funding from 
NASA, but it was not until 
February that Murphy received 
what he calls "substantial grants" 
from NASA - a budget of $1.3 
million over three years. 

"Now we can actually do this 
experjment for real," Murphy 
sa id .

House 
Bill would keep 

Pell grants at 
flat rate 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a highly anticipated reau-
thorization of the Higher 
Education Act, House Republican 
leaders have introduced a bill that 
would keep Pell Grant awards flat 
and incorporate many of the pro-
posals included in President 
George W. Bush's budget direc-
tive. 

Co-sponsors Reps. John 
Boehner (R-OH) ' and Howard 
"Buck" McKeon (R-CA) said their 
College Access and Opportunity 
Act of 2004, introduced on May 5, 
would expand college access to the 
needy and eliminate the "mysteIy 
behind higher-education financ -
ing." 

"For almost a year, Illy col-
leagues and I have been working 
diligently to put forth a reautho-
ri zation package that increases 
college access for millions of low-
and middle-income students, and 
this bill achieves just that, " 
McKeon sa id in a sta tement. 
"Although the college cost crisis is 
far frolll over, this bi ll make~

GENDER AT UCSD: MIT 2 OF :s 

Report finds underrepresentation of 
women faculty in science departnlents 

By U5AMAK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Although the number of 
women faculry members has 
increased significantly in the 
social sciences and humanities 
departments over the past decade, 
women continue to be underrep-
resented on the faculty of engi-
neering and science departments, 
according to sratiS[ics from the 
Office of Academic Affirmative 
Action and the UCSD Health 
Sciences Gender Equity Task 
Force report released in April. 

The Health Sciences Task 
Force report found that women 
are underrepresented among the 
health sciences faculty when com-
pared to the available pool of 
applicants. 

In addition, female faculty 
seem to be given accelerated acad-
emic advancement in the health 
sciences less often than men, the 
report said. 

According to the most recent 
statistics from the Office of 
Academic Affirmative Action, 
women make up 16 perceQt of the 
UCSD tenured faculty as a whole. 
Ilowever, men constitute close to 
90 percent of tenured faculry in 
the physical and biological sci-
ences and School of Medicine. 

This is significantly different 
from other departments, such as 
the social sciences and the arts and 
humanities, where men constitute 
76 percent and 69 percent of the 
tenured faculty, respectively. 

According to current statistics, 
93 percent of the tenured faculry 
at the Jacobs School of 
Engineering are male. 

"It's very disappointing to see 
what that breakdown is and the 
fact that UCSD is worse than the 
UC average," said Pam Cosman, 
who is the only female professor 
in the electrical and computer 
engineering department. "UCSD 
is very heavy on sciences and engi-
neering, and women tend to be 
less well-represented in [these 
fields], so if you have a campus 
which is dominated by that, then 
you're going to have a faculty 
which will have fewer women." 

Kim Barren, a professor or 
medicine and co-chair of the 
Health Sciences Gender Equity 
Task Force, said obtaining tenure 
remains a difficulry for women. 

"The proportion of women in 
those positions has basically been 
flat for a large number of years," 
Barren said. "While we have had 
some growth in the representation 
of women in the medical field, it's 
all in series that don't carry any 
tenure." 

The report states that on aver-
age, women in the health sciences 
are paid about 23 percent less in 
wages than their male colleagues. 
The report also found that 
although women are well-repre-

. seored on health sciences commit-
tees, they are rarely found in the 
top leadership positions on these 
committees. 

"Our findings don't necessarily 
mean that there is discrimination 
going on, but just point out that 
we have to look at why there are 
these apparent discrepancies," 
Barrett said. 

The health sciences report 
reinforced findings from a March 
2002 Gender Equiry Task Force 

report conducted for the general 
campus. The March report cited 
the recruitment and retention of 
female faculty members as the 
most serious challenge facing 
departments, particularly in the 
sciences and engineering. The 
report also found that over the 
past 44 years, women have been 
hired with a salary averaging 7 
percent lower than that of men. 

Barrett referred to the lack of 
female faculty in certain depart-
ments as a "self-fulfilling prophe-
cy." 

"If you don't have women fac-
ulty, then women students don't 
see those role models and don't 
get the impression that that's 
something they can do as a career 
choice, and you have fewer 
women students who would then 
choose these fields," she said. 

Statistics show that more 
women are represented on the 
faculry of humanities and social 
science departments. 

In the communication depart-
ment, 53 percent of the tenured 
faculry are female. Females also 
constitute 33 percent and 43 per-
cent of the tenured faculty in the 
ethnic studies and literature 
departments, respectively. 

Communication is the only 
department with a majority of 
female professors, the data showed. 
According to Geoffrey Bowker, 
chair of the communication 
department, the department adver-
tises to networks of feminist schol-
ars and minority ethnic groups 
during the hiring process and also 
works with the affirmative action

Scripps Institution 
weathering cuts to UC 
Director predicts 'promising' 

financial state ahead 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

Senior Staff Writer 

Even as the University of 
California struggles to make neces-
sary reductions resulting from pre-
sent and future funding cuts from 
the state, not all parts of the system 
predict a gloomy future. 

For the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, which expects to 
end the year in a better financial 
state than it had anticipated, direc-
tor Charles Kennel said, that fUl1.lre 
IS a more promising one. 

Since 2000, Scripps has suffered 
three consecutive 10-percent cuts 
in the state's research budget, 
according to Kennel. The funding 
CutS came after the institution had 
already lost 10 percent of its state 
funds during the 199Os. 

At the time, Scripps' chief 
financial officer, Deputy Director 
of Administrative Affairs Tom 
Collins, said the fiscal outlook put 
him in "despair." 

"We had that money for 50 
years and we had used it to make 
long-term personnel commitments 
to researchers and faculry," Kennel 
said. "It was really fundamental to 
our operation. [The cuts havel hit 
our budget especially hard because 
half of our overall [state] budget 
comes from the research line and 
the other half basically from the 
teaching line." 

Though Scripps gets slightly 
more than 10 percent of its nearly 
$150 million budget from the state 
and the majority of the institution's 
total funding comes from federal 

and other grants, the grant money 
is awarcled to individual researchers 
and cannot be used for general 
expenditures. 

Since 2000, instead of distribut-
ing the cuts equally throughout all 
programs, Kennel sa id Scripps chose 
to protect itS acadcmic personnel 
and concentrate the reductions 
heavily in a few specific programs. 

The decision put the insritution's

THOU SHALT VALUE LIBRARY WALK ACTIVISM 
Evangelism is a valuable way to share 

alternative ideas and perspectives 
By ISRA YAGHOUBI 

Staff Writer 

A 2002 ABC News poll informed that, 
"Eighty- three percent of Americans identi-
fy themselves as Christians. Thirty-seven 
percent of all Christians describe them-
selves as born-again or evangelical." 
Should it be a su rprise, then , to come into 
contact with evangelism at UCSD while 
strolling down Library Walk? For some 
students, evangelism has come to represent 
a l\ annoying and even offending presence. 
Bei ng condemned to hell for 
disagreeing wi th another's 

independent of classrooms or office walls. 
II just so happens that humans are social 

beings, dependent on communities and a 
sense of connection to others. Religious 
evangelist groups are often effective 
because they take the initiative to reach out 
to people and offer a potential crowd to be 
a part of, while also offering free services, 
food or more. People, especially alienated 
college students, need some sate llite com-
munity when away from home and should 
be trusted as fully able to check out all the 
groups that are out there and decide which 

one suits them best. The ones 
that reach out will of course be 

belief or being shunned for not 
taking part in :I popular/zealous 
call~c is val ill basis for griev-
ance, but examination shows 
that all evangelism is not inher-
entl y bad or in-your-face 

PRO 
more effective, but this is so for 
any group , religious and zeal-
ous or not. 

During third week this 
quarter, a Christian group on 
campus offered free baked 
goods, haircuts, massages, care 
packages, test materials and 

extremist, and that it undoubt-
edly has its place on a college 
campus. 

Evangelism can be loosely defined as 
"mi litant zeal for a cause," but is primarily 
used ina religious context wi th a more spe-
cific meaning. By authority of 
Dlctionary.com, it is the "zea lous preach-
ing and (hssemination of the gospel, as 
through missionary work" or "conversion 
resulting from the zeal of crusading advo-
cacy of the gospel." Two general character-
istics of thi more widely used and more 
specific definition of evange lism are the 
beliefs [hal: the Bible is authoritative, 
bll1ding and must be obeyed; 
and the Gospel is for everyone, 
ano thus the job of every 
Christia n is to let others know 
about the good ofJesus Christ. 

To presume that one reli-
gious [caching is the path for 
everyone is an ambitious goal 
(guod luck trying to conven the 
globe) and, more so, would pro-
vide humanity with a horribly 
homogenized perspective (the 
spice of world cultures is owed 
in no small part to the variety of 
religions, each with contrasti ng 
and overlapping ideologies, 
practices and nuances). Yct, even 
proselytizing has its place in this 
world for l simple and com-
pelling reason : the need for a 

rides to school. Some would argue all the 
kindness comes with strings areached. But 
so what if someone or some group does 
something kind expecting something in 
return? The fact is that in this society and 
in our times, anyone can walk up, take 
advantage of the freebies, say "thank you" 
and walk away. Ideally, kindness is altruis-
tic and asks for nothing in return, but in 
the meantime, kind actions are still kind 
actions, regardless of whether their intent 
makes good things happen. Habitat for 
Humanity happens to be evangelical, but 

Spreading one's message may be a right, 
but it's not always wise or effective 

By KELLY GILBEIn' 
Staff Writer 

It's a familiar scene: the bearded man on 
a wood block shouting to passersby about 
hellfire. The plethora of "Naughty 
Schoolgirl" -themed party invitations. 
Sorority sisters stalking girls not already 
wearing some sort of Greek lereers. 

Yes, freedom of speech is alive and well 
on Library Walk. 

Once a designated passing area, the 
walkways leading between Geisel Library, 
Center Hall and the eucalyp-
tus grove have become forums 

peaceful protest would be pointless. 
There is, however, a point where cam-

paigning becomes counter-effective. 
While groups have every right to push 
their ideals onto others, prudence would 
demand otherwise. When demonstrators 
on Library Walk shredded issues of Tht 
KOIII4, for example, it was an exceptionally 
dumb move for students concerned .. bout 
the publication's circulation - the contro-
versy those same students caused most 
likely made the Koala:r readership sk)'Tock-
et. Similarly, the chances of a swarm of 

students clad in some sort of 
subversive, far-left T-shirts 

for expression and advertise-
ment. Daily, those spots spawn 
a smorgasbord of job fairs, 
recruitment fairs, evangelistic 
outreaches, Panhellenic days 
and assorted protests. On most 
days , it 's difficult to avoid 

(ON actually influencing another, or persuading him to some opinion, is slim to nil. It's far more likely that the student 
would disregard the group as 
too liberal or too flashy or too 

being handed at least one flyer 
while passing through Library Walk. 

This is, actually, a good thing. 
Particularly at a large public university, the 
freedom to partake in all of the above is a 
crucial, keystone right. As long as an orga-
ni7.ation or an individual remains within 
the boundaries of free speech - not cross-
ing the lines into hate speech or slander -
it is critical, not to mention constitutional, 
that such freedom be allowed. 

In the case of Library Walk, however, 
it's enough to simply know the right exists. 
True, we have the right to promote just 

extreme, and thu the group's 
deeper poli tical message 

would be wasted. By that same token, a 
Christian fellowship that aggressively and 
commercially markets its services misses 
the point of evangelism, and, for good rea-
son, i likely to turn people away. 
Unsolicited marketing literature forced 
upon a student will probably irritate him. 
And groups that employ any extreme mea-
sures to make a point - like the Muslim 
Student Association, for example, claim-
ing that "'Never Again' is happening 
again," in that the Holocaust is being mir-
rored by the deaths of Palestinians - im-

ply destroy their own credi-
bility.

The ability to champion or I 

Furthermore, while the 
right to exprcss and share 
one's beliefs is a given, com-
mon courtesy should playa 
commensurate role in 
Library Walk politics. As a 
modus operandi, most 
groups provide a table com-
plete with pamphlets and 
representatives to answer 
questions, which is an excel-
lent means of making them-
selves accessible without 
being offensively pushy. 
Students are thus allowed 
the opportunity to acknowl-
edge the presence of the 
organization and, if they are 
inclined, to ' pursue that 
interest. It's definitely 
acceptable - even well-
strategized - for a group to 
have a representative mem-
ber speaking to those who 
walk by, perhaps to pose a 
thought-provoking question 
or to draw additiomil atten-
tion by having personal con-
tact. 

shun any ideology or cause is 
depcndent on knowing about it. 
A person can't defend or refute 
what they don't know about. 
Evangelism, like atheism, or 
socialism or environmentali sm, 
should not be denied a place in 
the marketplace of ideas, where 
peuple can frcely discuss what it 
means and what its pros and 
cons arc. T hi s process of free 
exchange births new philoso-
phies with, presumably, 
ilnproRmcnm upon ~e ~d~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
ideas. 

But it's ludicrous to believe 
that yelling, "Repent or burn 
in Hell!" will elicit much of a 
response beyond encouraging 
an aversion to Christianity in 
general. By that same token, 

Chris Hiesta nd , a student at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College who is a double major in 
the Study of Religions and Electrical 
Engineering, said, "Even though I don't 
like what thc)" re preaching, I like debating 
with them." 

Via inrcrllctions with eva ngelists on 
ca mpus, C hris felt he "made headway" by 
introducing them to the documentary 
hypothesis (of the Hebrew Bible), while he 
also learned that Jehovah's \Vitnesses are 
conscientious objectors and pacifists. 
(Note: There arc di fferenccs in ductrine 
between thcJehovah's Witnesses and evan-
gelical C hristians, but both engage in 
evangeli zing.) There is no better place 
th :1I1 a university for the exchange of 
diverse teachings and perspectives. If not 
here, then where ? Probably not in the lIIid-
die of ""hole Foods or thc New York Stock 
Exchange. Ilow refreshing that people 
willingly engage in this SOrt of cx~hange 

in the meantime builds homes all over the 
world for those who can't afford a place to 
live. Another fact is that everyone, from 
professors to politicians to parents to chil-
dren, has motives and everyone acts ratio-
nally in order to balance their interests 
with the interests of others. Why should 
the motives of a religious group be treated 
any differently then those of a political or 
social group? 

Evangelist groups on campus also take 
part in sharing testimonies about personal 
experiences with the divine , either by walk-
ing lip to people individually or via loud-
speaker on Library Walk. Some will com-
plain this is intrusive or not worth hearing. 
While those uninterested can politely 
deFline or walk away, they will have given 
up the opportunity, in the "repressed" cli-
mate of UCSD, to witness students speak-

See PIO, Paj«' 6 

about anything, but by no stretch of the 
imagination can exercising uninhibited 
"freedom of speech" - brashly propagat-
ing and audaciously forcing ideas on 
another - be construed as an intelligent, 
effective policy. 

Advertising and all its cousins -
recruitment, flashy fliers, approaching 
passers-by with "just a few quick survey 
questions" - are not, by themselves, bad 
things; more than likely, the advocate's 
!Tlotives are good. If one isn't actively try-
ing to recruit others to his organization or 
system of beliefs, in fact, that's a likely indi-
cator that he either lacks strong convictions 
about whatever it is hes professing, or that 
he's simply selfish. Christian groups that 
didn't evangelize would be hypocritical and 
ineffective. Fraternities that didn't care 
enough to recruit new pledge classes prob-
ably wouldn't be worth joining. Anti-war 
groups that didn't stage some form of 

it's impolite to forcefully attempt to convince 
a student on his way to class that President 
George W. Bush should be impeached. And 
last month when the MSA presented displays 
that "exposed" Zionism, they depicted them-
selves as reactionary and derogatory and 
more than a little self-righteous. No doubt 
the San Diego Israel Alliance, nearby with "I 
Love Israel; I Want Peace" T-shirts, was not 
alone in taking offense. If the sheer futility of 
aggressive proselytizing isn't enough to ' 
evince restraint, the subsequent rudeness ofit 
should be. 

To truly make Library Walle advertis-
ing efficacious, it's crucial to consider how 
a person will respond to various tactics of 
persuasion. If someone is genuinely irri-
tated by overzealousness, it is obviously 
counterproductive to attempt to win 
members, votes, pledges or souls in a 
manner that has significant potential to 
offend. 

MONDAY, MAY 17, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

A half-century after Brown v. Board of Education, 
higher education remains woefully segregated 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

F ifty years ago today, America won. In war, there are often no winners, 
because even the victorious cannot 
emerge unscathed, yet on h1ay 17, 
1954, just the opposite occurred. 
On that day, the Supreme Court 
ruled unanimously that segrega-
tion in schools was unconstitu-
tional in BrO'lU1l v. BOllrd of 
Edru:.rio" in Topeka, Kan. 
Technically, the five defendant 
parties who favored segregation 
lost the legal war, yet even they 
were winners when the nine jus-
tices struck down the previous 
precedent of "separate bur equal." 
Those against the decision may 
have felt defeated, but only 
because they were still trapped 
within their antiquated mindsets. 
Indeed, the only real casualties 
that day were racism and injustice . . 

Brown v. BOIIrd of Educlltion was 
a combination of five cases, head-
lined by Oliver Brown, whose 
daughter had to ride a bus every 
day to a poor-quality, all-black 
school. He c;hallenged the Topeka 
Board of Education's policy of 
racial segregation on the basis of 
the Equal Protection Clause of the 
14th Amendment. The Supreme 
Court justices agreed with him, 
and as outlined in two opinions in 

h1ay 1954 and 1955, demanded 
that all schools be desegregated. 

If this were a fairy tale, then the 
parade toward the happy ending 
would include a swift and uncon-
tested end to institutional segrega-
tion in all schools and an equally 
smooth transformation of preju-
diced h!=arts and minds . The grand 
finale would be a stasis of high-
quality education in integrated 
schools. Socioeconomic back-
grounds would merely be elements 
of biography and not determinants 
of success in life. 

As nice as all that sounds, I am 
grateful that we do not live in a 
fairy-tale world. Because without 
the growing pains and failures of 
the process, the present would be 
devoid of lessons. There are cer-
tainly many lessons to be learned 50 
years after that landmark case. 

To our generation, differences 
- racial, ethnic and otherwise -
are not only supposed to be 
embraced, but also celebrated. 
"h1ulticulruralism" is a hot-bunon 
word, and our skin color is some-
thing to be exalted, not ignored. 
The noble efforts for diversity at 
UCSD testify to these rules: We 
have our cultural/ethnic groups 
that ostensibly celebrate and edu-
cate, but also segregate. The offi-
cial UCSD Web site and admis-
sions brochures show pictures of 
black graduates, or a diverse group 
of friends. Then you click a link or 
actually turn the page, and the sta-
tistics nullify the pictures. 

According to the UCSD 
Student Research and Information 
enrollment statistics for 2003, 
African Americans only make up I

percent of total undergraduate 
enrollment - that's 244 undergrad-
uates Latinos (including 
Mexican Americans) are 10 percent, 
and Native Americans make up less 
than I percent. The same range of 
numbers more or less exist at the 
other UC schools, as well as other

top-notch universities . Ask anyone 
and they'll probably have a theory 
or two about why whites and Asian 
Americans dominate the University 
of California. Affirmative action 
will come up a lot, as will musings 
about economic advantages. It cer-
tainly isn't because there is a dearth 
of blacks and Latinos in California. 
Why isn't there more diversity? It 
has been fifty years since Bruum v. 
Board of Edu<ation, but is education 
any more equal? 

Maybe not, says a study by 
Newsweek on the eve of the Brown 
anniversary. According to statistics 

cited in the May 7 issue, an average 
white student's primary or sec-
ondary school is 80 percent white, 
an average black student's school is 
54 percent black and an average 
Latino student's school is 54 per-
cent Latino. What all this means is 
that even without institutionalized 
segregation, schools across the 
country have disproportionate con-
centrations of racial segments. The 
fact is that many poor areas are 
populated by minorities, whose 
schools lack the same quality and 
resources that upper-middle-class 
schools have. The repercussions 
spill into universities. For example, 
the main feeder schools of entering 
freshmen for 2003 at UCSD were 
Arcadia, Lynbrook and Mission 
San Jose high schools - all in 
upper-middle-class neighborhoods 
with overwhelming numbers of 
Asian American and white popula-
tions. I have friends from all these 
schools, and they can vouch that 
the academics are top-notch and 
the competition is brutal. These 
schools also happen to be in the 
first quintile of all schools in the 
state, and have regularly high 
scores in Academic Performance 
Index rankings. 

It's clear that these privileged 
schools consistently send kids to 
excellent universities, such as this 
one, in large part due to their 
resources and financial surround-
ings. It's not that UCSD doesn't 
want to admit underprivileged 
minorities - to the contrary, it 
actively recruits them. Instead, the 
truth is that whi tes and Asian 
Americans have the SAT scores and 
GPAs and superior high schools to 

get them into college. Other 
minorities, it may seem, are just 
stuck in the vicious cycle. 

So if blacks and Latinos are 
still grossly underrepresented in 
top colleges, and relegated to 
mostly poorly funded , less privi-
leged schools, then what did 
Brown accomplish? For one thing, 
Brown dealt a severe blow to the 
politicians, educators and com-
mon citizens who truly believed 
that segregation was right. The 
psychological impact of declaring 
segregation unconstitutional 
paved the way for new solut ions 
and approaches and dialogue for 
equalizing not ~)Jlly education, but 
social and economic opportunities 
as well. Brown hel ped start the 
civi l rights movement, speeding 
up the pace of furthering racial 
equa lity that had been embarrass-
ingly sluggish since the end of the 
Civil War. . 

While many of the sa me racial 
disparities plague our schools 
today, there is hope that true 
racial equality - educational and 
otherwi e - will one day be 
achieved in Anlerica . Brown wasn't 
a surefire solution, but the open-
ing act of a brighter future. As 
college students who see homo-
geneity, especially at UCSD , it is 
up to us to either· ignore it, com-
plain about it or constructively 
continue the dialogue. Fifty years 
ago, America won. Let that victo-
ry be the inspiration for many 
more to come.

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MAY 17.1004 

Pro: Evangelism promotes 
thought and healthy debate 

Watson wrong about Triton Taxi 
continued from page 4 

ing openly about issues in life that 
affect everyone - fa mily, love, 
drugs, stress and so on. One does-
n't have to share someone's beliefs 
or lifestyle in order to learn from 
their basic experi ences. 

Admi ttedly, there are extremist 
evangelical groups, of the reli -
gious and not-50-religious kind , 
that cross boundaries of basic 
respec t , personal space and even 
safety. 

La t year, a non-UCSD-affili-
ated religious group came to cam-
pus with graphic posters 150 feet 
tall of aborted fetuses and placed 
them in front of Geisel Library. 
This was viewed by quite a few as 
somewhat distasteful, but the 
answer was not to make the group 
leave. In response, VOX, the 
Planned Parenthood group, 
brought out large posters verging 
0'1) pornographic. Conversations 
were sta rted, dialogue exchanged. 

But, there are those who cross 
the line . Brother Jeb, a free-float-
ing pro elyte in his late 50s, used 
to come to Library Walk a few 
yea rs back and perch on the 
cement blocks, preaching chastity 
IU "co llege girl s trying to seduce 
me," and stressing that their 

bosoms were intended to "feed 
thirsty babies" and not for public 
display. Many students found 
Brother J eb amusing but some 
also found his additional hostile 
words about Asians and Jews 
offensive. 

The kinds of groups that make 
disrespectful moral judgments 
about others and cannot respect 
the beauty of diversity are an 
unfortunate part of reality, but 
they have a right to voice their 
views. Others will then have the 
opportunity to respond and chal-
lenge their ideas. Some groups 
may spout seemingly ominous 
ideology, like the Cyborg 
Collective's message that "All is 
cyborg, cyborg is all . Resistance 
is futile." But chances are, your 
life will not be overtaken by 
cyborgs and your resistance is not 
futile . 

The point is, there is some-
thing to learn from everyone. 
Evangelists, whether in the con-
text of religion or in the context 
of a student group protesting 
budget cuts, offer something to, 
at the very least, think about. 
Exploring thought is something 
college students should not be 
afraid of. 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W Watson wants the students 
ofUCSD to know that he cares about 
us. He cares so much, in fact, that he's 
working to protect us from the ulti-
mate evil : rides home from off-am-
pus gatherings with Triton Taxi. 

As a "student portal" project. 
which would expand and integrate 
the online services available to 
UCSD students. undergoes develop-
ment, the A.S. Council is presented 
with the possibility of placing Triton 
Taxi waivers online. Currendy, Triton 
Taxi stickers and waivers are available 
from the third floor of Price Center; 
shifting this process to the Internet 
seemed like an easy way to encourage 
students to sign up for the program. 

This seemingly benign change 10 
the Triton Taxi service unleashed 
WatsOn's wrath, however. and he's 
publicly come out to oppose the 
entire Triton Taxi service - fretting 
that an online waiver would encour-
age "illicit partying" and is "inappro-
priate and especially inadvisable from 
the perspective of student safety." 

In becoming preoccupied with 
policing students' off-ampus activi-
ties, Watson forgets that Triton Taxi 
provides a safe ride home for srudents 

on weekends, regardless of their cir-
cumstances. In a sprawling city with 
inadequate public transportation, 
there are coundess reasons why stu-
dents might need rides back to cam-
pus, and the popularity of the Triton 
Taxi service illustrate this demand. 

Travis Silva, former chair of 
Thurgood Marshall College Student 
Council, wrote in a April 29 letter to 
Watson, "The Associated StudenlS ... 
provide Triton Taxi as a resource to 
UCSD students ... Placing the 
Triton Taxi waiver online will 
increase visibility of the program. 
boost program sign-ups and raise 
general awareness of the limitations 
of the program. This significant stqJ 
is vital to improving srudent safety at 
UCSD." 

In his replies 10 the letter, and in 
subsequent quotes, Watson odiously 
implies that the Triton Taxi service in 
general is somehow detrimental to 
student safety. "I don't think rrriton 
Taxi is) a type of activity that should 
be IOrmally associated with the uni-
versity's administrative operations," 
he said. lUther than recognizing 
Triton Taxi's prevention of drunk-
driving incidents, Watson instead 
wants to dismantle the program 
entirely. He ad'VOCates "a range of 
prognms that would be considerable 
[sic) more effective than the Triton

Students, don't rely on your repre-

In addition, the Uc. D G (1I1"dilll1 
reported on May 13, "As an altern,l-
tive to TrilOn Taxi, Watson called for 
more programs to improve student 
safety through education" - a trite 
and empty recommendation to make, 
and one that disregards the fact that 
UCSD studenlS have been bombard-
ed by drug and alcohol education 
programs all their lives. 

In a quote that shows just how 
divon:ed he is from the realities of 
college life, Watson said , "[Triton 
Taxi) is not a safety program. It is a 
program to facilitate the consump-
tion of alcohol. It is a program that 
encourages and facilitates students 
getting into circumstances in which 
they are not safe." Watson makes the 
unfortunate and element:try mistake 
of confusing the direction of C;IlISOI-
tion. Triton Taxi doesn 't C,lll~e alm-
hoi consumption; a wille rJngc of 
cultural, situational, SOCial and psy-
chological factors do. Rather, -Iliron 
Taxi serves a fundamentally different 
- and fundamentally pO itive -
role: The program mitigates the 
effects of the inevitable off-campus 
alcohol consumption of UCSD snl-
dents by providing an ea"}' and safe 
alternative to driving home dnlllk , 
staying overnight at parties and other 
unsafe situations. 

Fortunately, Watson's flawed crit-
icism of the program is nega ted by its 
sheer popularity and effectiveness in 
curbing drunk driving. In the spring 
of 2000, it received a $ 1,000 3wml 
from The Automobile Club of 
Southern California and the I lighcr 
Education Center for Alcohol and 
Other Drug Prevention for its 
effectiveness in "[providingj studcnL~ 
with an alternative to drinking and 
driving." Steven Bloch, the Auto 
Club's senior traffic aferv researcher, 
praised Triton Taxi for the "v.tlllahk 
service it provides to students'· in the 
press release announcing the award, 
going on to say, "We wanr to encour-
age more such programs at coll e!!,e~ 
and universities 0 that drinking dri -
vers are not on the streets posing :I 
threat to themselves, pas~engers Jnd 
other motorists. " 

Triton Taxi is arguably the A.S. 
Council's most valuable service to 
students, and we all fclt a hi t of :t 
sting when its service to the U .S.-
Mexico border was ended. While the 
value of the program stems from 
inevitable off-campus parties and the 
sorry state of public transportation in 
the San Diego area, it also stems 
from the extremely well-enforced 
ban on alcohol on campus. Because 
of the militancy displayed by resident 
security officers on campus, all sorts 
of student gatherings - even those 
that don't involve a drop of alcohol 
- are forced to move off-campus. 
The campus alcohol policy will S\1re-
ly not be relaxed, especially as long as 
Watson is around, and this rather 
unfortunate reality simply under-
scores the need for TritoI11:lXi . 

\\'hen he takes it upon himself to 
try to impact students' off-campus 
behavior, Watson is clearly overstep-
ping his bounds. What students do 
off-c,unpus is their own business, 
especially when 18-year-old fresh-
men ca n enjoy legal drinks in Mexico

Revision: Proposed May budget includes 
$1.3 billion less for local governments 

continued from page I 
has always been set at 33 percent 
in the past. 

"That didn't give us anything 
- frankly, we lost on that one," he 
said. 

The revision indicates that the 
54 million in UC internal funds to 
be restored to outreach will come 
from nonresident tuition as part of 
the $12 million put forth by the 
university itself for outreach pro-
grams. 

"This changes nothing from 
what was proposed in January," 
Academic Success Program 
Director Terry Le said, adding that 
the funds were not sufficient. 
"Funding outreach continues to be 
taken up by the UCs, meaning 
something else in the budget must 
be compromised ... I can only 
hope that support for this initiative 
to restore funding for outreach 
from the state will be found among 
OUf legislators and community." 

Hayward said the university 
was hopeful that state funds for 
outreach would be negotiated 
back into the budget during the 
legislative process. 

The city of San Diego will suf-
fer from cuts as well as part of the 
$1.3 billion taken from localities. 

In exchange, the governor 
promised to support a constitu-
tional amendment that would put 
limits on the state's ability to tap 
into local revenues beginning in 
2006. If passed by the Legislarure, 
voters will decide on the amend-
ment in Nov.ember. 

"With this agreement, I am 
keeping my promise to cities and . 

counties to ensure that local gov-
ernments have a reliable revenue 
stream to pay for local services," 
Schwarzenegger said in a May 12 
statement. "This agreement is 
another example of the new spirit 
of cooperation and a new respect 
between state and local govern-
ments in California." 

According to the governor's 
statement, the agreement will 
reduce replacement property taxes 
that cities receive by 5700 million 
with the promise that the state will 
provide reimbursements of about 
$2.3 billion to local governments 
starting in 2006. While many local 
politicians have voiced their sup-
port for the agreement, others 
have expressed uncertainty 
regarding the long-term effects of 
the governor's budget. 

According to political science 
professor Thad Kousser, an expert 
in California politics, the new 
plans could spell trouble for the 
governor. 

"Clearly this is one of the vic-
tories for Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger in the short 
term," Kousser said. "It allows 
him to make cuts in the short run 
without tax increases .. . but in the 
long term, he has created prob-
lems In that he has n 't fixed 
California's structural deficit and 
he hasn't fixed the imbalance in 
deficit spending." 

According to a statement 
released by San Diego City 
Councilman Jim Madaffer, who 
was among city representatives in 
Sacramento when the deal was 
made, the state has taken $350 

million a year from the City of San 
Diego since 1994. 

Madaffer said that the agree-
ment would ensure that funds 
taken by the state remain in San 
Diego. In the May 14 statement, 
he argued that the agreement 
would provide local governments 
a solid assurance that future funds 
will not be taken by the state. 

"It is unlikely this practice of 
feeding off of the local trough 
would ever end without these 
negotiated long-term protections 
for vital government services like 
police, fire, parks, libraries, road 
repairs, community service cen-
ters and more," Madaffer said in 
the statement. 

However, Madaffer also said 
that he recognized that the city 
will be facing sacrifices in the next 
two years . 

"While these short-term sacri-
fices would undoubtedly impact us 
here at home, the long-term pro-
tections would provide much-need-
ed fiscal stability at the local level 
and ensure we can continue fund -
ing the critical local services upon 
which our residents rely," he stated. 

With the successful passage of 
Propositions 57 and 58 in March, 
experts are predicting that the gov-
ernor's support will help gain votes 
for the constinttional amendment. 

"The key thing is that Arnold 
[Schwarzenegger) pledged to sup-
port [the amendment)," Kousser 
said. "He proved with 
Propositions 57 and 58 where his 
personal support can go. This con-
stitutional amendment is certain to 
not pass without the governor. "

Scripps has stepped up its 
effort to raise private money, dou-
bling its fundraising in a single 
year. The money, in addition to 
increased grants, has been enough 
to avert or reduce some of the 
proposed cuts to programs. 

Since 2000, funding from the 
National Science Foundation, the 
institution 5 largest financier, has 
grown by nearly 60 percent, from 
$26 million to more than S41.5 
million in 2003, according 10 NSF 
data. In the previous four-year peri-
od, Scripps raised its NSF grant 
amount by less than 10 percent. 

Overall, Scripps has increased 
its total grant funding by 41 per-
cent in the last two years, accord-
ing to Kennel. 

In addition, though Scripps 
originally began as an indepen-
dent laboratory, the institution has 
entered into a new parmership 
with UCSD, increasing its role in 
undergraduate teaching to gain 
access to more academic funding. 

The institution has created 14 
new course offerings, according to 
Kennel, and is currently working 
with the university to create a for-
mal marine biology major in addi-
tion to several other in terdiscipli-
nary programs to be run jointly 
with the university. 

Scripps has also increased its 
graduate population by 27 percent 
to 206 since fan 2000, according 
to university records. Though the 
students receive a five-year finan-
cial aid guarantee, Kennel said the 
growth has improved the institu-
tion's ability to secure research 
funding. 

In exchange, UCSD has picked 
up some of Scripps' tab in recent

years when the institution's cash 
flow has remained in the red . The 
debt to the university is "in the 
millions," Collins said, though he 
would not disclose the actual 
amount of the debt. 

"That's the arrangement that the 
university has made with us: We'll 
work hard on the university by 
increasing their undergraduate 
teaching, and we'll give them new 
oppommities for research that they 
wouldn't have otherwise," Kennel 
said. "But in return for that, they'll 
continue to invest in us and even 
help us grow if we do our job right." 

After celebrating its 1 OO-year 
anniversary last fall, the institution 
believes it has made a turnaround, 
with its debt to the university 
increasi n g for the curren t year by 
a smaller amount than it had 
expected. 

"The good news is that it 
appears that [the deficit] will be 
less this year than we had predict-
ed, significantly," Collins said . 

As one of the world's oldest 
and most renowned marine sci-
ence research centers, Kennel 
believes Scripps' partnership with 
UCSD puts it in a good position 

to benefit from the pote ntia l 
increases in federal spending. 

In 2002, a report by the inde-
pendent Pew Oceans 
Commission, on which Kennel 
served, formally recommended 
that Congress provide "substantial 
federal funding" for future invest-
ment into the nation 's oceans. 
Another recent preliminary report 
from the federally chartcred U.S. 
Commission on Ocean Policy has 
urged the federal government to 
more than double its current $1.3 
billion in ocean research and pay 
for the development of a national 
ocean observing system. 

Collins, who also serves as 
UCSD's associate vice chancellor 
for marine sciences, said he 
believes Scripps' budget chal -
lenges are a microcosm of the 
entire UC system, coming two 
years ahead of the university'S. 

"Because of the process that 
we've gone through in the past year, 
especially with the type of support 
we've gonen from UCSD, I very 
much believe ... that the institution 
is going to come out the other end 
healthy and maybe healthier than it 
was before," he sa id.

Brown: Speaker talks 
about 're ... segregation' 

HEA: Academic Bill of Rights included 

continued from page I 
called for the desegregation of 
public schools "with all deliberate 
speed." 

"The only problem with the 
decision was that it didn't specify 
how you would implement this," 
Hernandez said. "We have this 
wonderful statement that 'separate 
and equal' can't happen [and] yuu 
have 10 integrate, [butl how do we 
.. . force districts who don't want to 
[integrate I to do it? And that 
became the challenge." 

Yet Hernandez also argued that 
other racial groups besides blacks 
were affected by segregation laws. 

"The fact of the maner is, it was 
never simply a black-white issue," 
Ilernandez said. "It was, in many 
senses, a white issue against every-
body else. (n California, it was part 
of our law ... that we were able to 
have separate schools for persons of 

' Indian , Chinese, Japanese and 
Mongolian descent. If you estab-
lished those schools, those children 
were not permitted 10 go to any 
other school than that school." 

Hernandez went on to discuss 
the histories of everal other perti-
nent legal cases, mcluding the 1974 
case of Loll v. V;chols. in which the 
San Francisco school district was 
sued on the basis that it denied edu-
cational oppornmities 10 Chinese 
students who did not peak English. 

Ilernandez argued that the trend 
over the past decade has been 1Il0V-
II1g toward re-segregati ng public 
school . partly due to public apathy 
on the issue of inteb'Tation, she said. 

"The will to integrate is partly 
gone," Hernandez said. " I think in 
order to have integra ted schools, 
we really have to make it a high 
priuriry, policy-wise." 

According to H ernandez, many 
middle school students in 
Oceanside, Cali f., are sent to a spe-
cial school if they are seen to be 
falling behind academically. The 
particular ~chool they are sent to is 
the "most r'lcia Jl y isolated high 
school there," with stlldents of 
color constituting about 85 percent 
of the population. Ilernandez also 
said that m:lny schools arc segregat-
ed by income distribution, resulting 
in schools with fewer qualified 
teachers and fewer resources. 

"The racially identifi .. ble schools 

that are white are much more likely 
to be middle-class or affluent," 
Hernandez said. "The schools that 
are segregated that are more identi-
fiable with African-American or 
Latino students are more likely to be 
in concentrations of poverry '" so 
you start out with the fact that [the 
schools] are separate and unequal." 

Ramon A1decoa, assistant dean 
of student affairs for Warren col-
lege. said that unequal access to 
higher education, whether from 
class or race, is still a problem today. 

"What's interesting is that his-
torically, the first desegregation 
cases came in higher education set-
tings, " Aldecoa said. "Now here we 
are, finding ourselves ... complete-
lyon the other side " . I believe that 
we should have an opportuniry to 
reevaluate how we're accessing 
people to higher education because 
we see that it's just not working." 

The majoriry of students who 
attended the event were from 
Warren college. 

"It was really interesting hearing 
the progress that local schools have 
made, or the lack of progress ," 
Warren senior Carolyn Lertzman 
said. "The media portrays progress 
in segregation ... but it seems as if 
there's still a long way to go." 

Warren senior Tri Nguyen 
emphasized rhe importance of 
remembering the Brown decision. 

"( think a lot of people ignore the 
[B"oumJ case," Nguyen said. "A lot 
of people assume that since we have 
the Broum decision and so many 
other laws, schools would be equal, 
but they're actually not. " 

Othcr campus events commem-
orating tllC BnTdlTl decision include 
the performance of "The Haunting 
of Jim Crow" on May 17 and May

politics of the 8"own case with the 
life of Scn. Strom Thurmond. 

"1 feci that [Broum] created some-

Expanding on the president's 
call for higher loan caps, the bill 
will increase student loan limits 
for freshman and sophomore col-
lege students from 52,625 to 
53,500 and from 53,500 to 
54,500, though it will leave the 
current four-year ceiling the 
same. In addition, it will gradual-
ly reduce origination fees, a cost 
assessed by lenders when stu-
dents take out loans, from the 
current 4 percent down to I per-
cent. 

However, the proposal did 
not include the president's 
request for making a I-percent 
guarantee fee for loans mandato-
ry, a plan that would have cost 
UCSD students, who currently 
don't pay the fee, an extra 
$700,000 overall. 

At the same time, Boehner and 
McKeon's bill calls for the imple-
mentation of Bush's "Pell Grant 
Plus" plan, allowing students to 
receive an extra 51,000 for com-
pleting rigorous high school class-
es under a program run in 13 
states. Because California does 
not participate in the program, its 
students would not be eligible for 
the extra aid. 

The proposal would also 
allow students to receive a sec-
ond Pell Grant in an academic 
year to cover summer study, a 
plan that drew praise from 
California State Universiry 
Chancellor Charles Reed during 
hi s testimony before the [louse 
Committee on Education and the 
Workforce a week after the bill 
was made public. As the largest 
four-year university system in 
the country, California State 
University currently receives 
53 16 mi II ion in Pell Grant 
awards for students studying at 
its 2J campuse , and constitutes 
4.5 percent of the nation's bach-
elor's degree graduates . 

In a speech before the commit-
tee, Rep. George Miller (D-CA) 
criticized Republicans for keeping 
Pell Grant amounts unchanged. 
The bill again authorizes the max-
imum grant at 55,800, though 
lawmakers last year chose to fund 
the maximum award at $4,050, 
short of the authorized cap. and

Miller also condemned a por-

was costing the government too

students would have to pay

sands of dollars more for their 
college loans, caps the maximum 
PeII Grant and fails to provide 
meaningful relief from rising 
tuition prices," Miller said during 
his speech. 

Rebecca Wasserman, presi-
dent of the United States 
Student Association - the 
largest and oldest student coali-
tion in the country - told 
Congress the bill was a disap-
pointment. 

USSA opposed higher loan 
caps and variable consolidation 
rates, also criticizing a non-bind-
ing Sense of the Congress resolu-
tion within the legislation in sup-
port of an ~Academic Bill of 
Rights," which calls for an elimi-
nation of ideological biases in 
campus programs. 

"While we believe that some 
provisions in this bill will help 
students, overall we oppose the 
College Opportuniry and Access 
Act, as it will foree millions of 
low- and middle-income students 
to pay more for college, deny free 
speech rights to students across 
the country, and re-open the 
doors to fraud and abuse in the 
student aid programs," 
Wasserman said. 

The proposal also drew criti-
cism from several Washington 
education lobby groups. 

"If you look at the bill broadly, 
the issues that probably have 
raised the greatest concerns have 
more to do with what we would 
view as the regulatory part of the 
higher education bill and perhaps 
less to do with the student aid 
portion," said Richard Harpel, 
director of federal relations at the 
National Association of State 

Universities and Land-Grant 
Colleges, a group representing 
212 institutions such as the 
U niversitv of California, includ-
ingUCSD. 

Harpel, who analyzed the 203-
page bill in the days after it 
became public, said he fears the 
proposal may actually increase 
costs for students, especially those 
at smaller universities. 

"On the regulatory side, there 
were just a number of things that 
seemed to tip the bill more and 
more in the direction of federal -
ization of higher education - in a 
way that not only has potential to 
be intruSive into academic deci-
sions, but I thi nk may well 
increase the cost of education for 
all students by vi rtue of more 
unfunded reporting mandates -
that in some cases would require 
significant increases in adminis-
trative costs," he said. 

In addition to the "Academic 
Bill of Rights," Harpel took issue 
with the new Academic 
Affordabiliry Index, which would 
track college costs. However, the 
proposal did not include potential 
sanctions and loss of federal fund-
ing for universities that increase 
tuition lar faster than the rate of 
inflation, as McKeon proposed in 
earlier legislation. 

The current bill would also 
require universities to increase 
reporting in areas of accreditation 
and tran fcr-credit policy. 

"Hecau e of these truubling 
prm'isions , as well as others, I do 
not think any of the Washington, 
D .C., associations will be able to 
support this legislation in its cur-
rent form," American Council on 
Education President David Ward 
said in a statement. "But we are 
pleased to finally sec an actual 
bill after months of discussion, 
meetings and hearings, and I 
hope we can make changes as the 
legislative process moves for-
ward." 

Before coming to the floor of 
the I louse, the legislation will be 
amended into Iinal form by the 
House Committee on Education 
and the Worl:force during the 
markup process. By law, 
Congress must reauthorize the 
Higher Education Act, first 
enacted in the 1960s, every five 
years.

Flying on a shoestring 
Iy ALEX QUICK 

Staff Writer 

If you think that one U.S. dollar 
can't get you anywhere in Europe 
these days, think again. Ireland-
based RyanAir is an airline that 
advertises flights from London to 
Oslo. Norway; Dublin, Ireland; 
Berlin: or Milan, Italy, for a fare of 
about $1 plus taxes. 

RyanAir is just one of a myriad 
of low-cost, no-frill airlines that 
have popped up all over Europe, 
changing rhe options for budget 
rravelers. For prices that often bear 
train tickets, or even the cost of 
getting to the airport, travelers can 
now fly wherever they want to go. 

In 1997, deregulation opened the 
door for more smaller airlines like 
RyanAir. More recently, changes in 
the European Union and decreased 
travel aiter the Sept. II attacks have 
both contributed to an explosion in 
the number of no-frills airlines. 
There arc currently over 60 airlines 
throughout Europe that use the 
bare-bone strategy pioneered by 
Southwest Airlines in the U.S. 

Lauren Wong, a Thurgood 
Marshall junior who studied in 
Barcelona, Spain, last year, said 
that she ilew EasyJet, another low-
cost airline based in the United 
Kingdom, when she was traveling 
in Europe. 

"Besides the prices, I liked that 
it was quick," Wong said. "One 
time I was una bit: to ily back to 
Barcelona (rom Paris and so I had 
to take the train. [t took forever 
and cost just as much as a flight." 

For srudents in America plan-
ning a trip through Europe, using 
low-fare airlines has many perks 
compared to the trains. For exam-
ple, plane tickets can be bought on 
airline Web sites with credit cards at 
any time, anywhere. Also, most no-
frills airlines use e1C<.tronic tickets, 
so losing your tickets is not an issue. 

Jeff Skacel, a Marshall fresh-
man, is going to Europe this sum-
mer with his girlfriend. He is city-
jumping exclusively by airplane. 

"I found that the airline's Web 
sites were milch easier to use than 
that of the trains," he said . "It was 
hard to figure out the train sched-
ules, routes and reservations." 

Brian Schaefer is a senior atJohn 
Muir College who visited 18 coun-
tries while studying in Denmark. 
Schaefer was more philosophical 
about why he thinks flying through-
out Europe can be a better option 
than the Eurail Pass that many 
American travelers in Europe buy in 
the States for over S4OO. 

"The Eurail encourages an 
American way of travel. To make it 
a good deal you need to go, go, 
go," he said. "It's a good way to see 
Europe, but not to experience it." 

Schaefer recommended Hying to 
a city and spending the saved travel-
time getting to know the city. 

Regardless of how one likes to 
travel, the proliferation of low-cost 
airlines is a good thing for all trav-

. elers in Europe. Airfares have 
become so cheap that train compa-

At 2,330 feet, Corcovado, or 
Hunchback Mountain, is the 
tallest peak surrounding the bay of 
Rio. AtOp it rests the famous 
ChristO Redentor, the Christ the 
Redeemer, a 98-fool statue of 
Christ with arms outstretched, 
who, according to inhabitants, 
protects Rio de Janeiro from 
harm. Corcovado, like Pao de 
Ar;ucar, gives visitors a stunning 
panorama of Rio and a perfect 
opporttmity to go crazy wi th their 
cameras. It is also home to dozens 
of wild monkeys eager to play 
with passersby. Corcovado can 
also be reached by taxi or cable car 
for about the same price as Pao de 

A~ucar. 
A walking tour of Rio is most 

conveniently started at the Pra~a 
Floriano, which is located at the 
very center of the city. Here you 
can linger around the cafes, 
shops, museums and restaurants 
for hours watching the lively 
street performers and mingling 
with the friendly locals. Some 
nearby sights not to be missed 
are the Museu Nacional de Belas 
Arres, Rio's premier fine art 
museum, the Par;o Imperial, or 
royal palace, and the Convento 
Santo Antonio, one of the city's 
oldest and most treasured cathe-
drals. 

After a long day of sightsee-
ing, relaxation is key. Rio offers 
some of the mOSt breathtaking 
beaches in South America, which 
are perfect for just winding

Tips for a backpacking 
adventure in Europe 

By JESSICA LONe 
Senior Staff Writer 

The traditional backpacking 
trip through Europe with a group 
of your neare t and dearest 
friends has almost become a rite 
of passage. Although part of the 
fun is learning more :1l>out new 
places as we)) as learning morc 
about yourself. knowing a fell' 
rips before you go can improve 
your trip. 

The first thing to do when 
planning a trip to Europe is care-
fully choosi ng who you go with. 
Just because you can spend a few 
hours :r week with someone does 
not mean that you will want to 
spend 24 hours a day witl1 them for 
a few weeks. This is also true for 
significant others because there is 
nothing worse than a break-up a 
few days into a trip. 

Make reservations for things 
you are interested in seeing. It 
saves time tanding in line, often in 
the boiling hot sun. Often reserva-

tions can be made online he fore 
you leave. Same goes for ho~tel> ; 
call ahead to reserve a ~pot. Even If 
you don't have the whole ~Ul1lmer 
plam1ed out, (;a)) ahead and make 
reservations a day or two before 
you get to your next destination . It 
wi)) keep you from \V,ming half J 
day or more trudging around with 
a heavy backpack bCll1g told that 
all the ho~tcls .Ire full. 

Try the local (';llI,II1C at the loc,l-
tions vou viSIt. Even if 1\ look> or

Locallnkerics often ell good food 
for cheap. For snack f()od~, check 
out local grocery stores r:Hher than 
buying chips :lI1d Cindy :It the train 
station; it' much cheaper. 

Learn to use ;1 N -hour clock 
before you leave. Nothing makes

tentious debates. Everything from 
politics to morals and ethics are 
discussed here; some noted 
patrons of this unique and eccen-
tric forum include Karl Marx, 
Vladimir Lenin. George Orwell 
and numerous other political 
thinkers. 

Another attraction is Regent's 
Park, once King Henry VIII's 
hunting ground, now populated 
with the Open Air Theatre. the 
London Zoo and many cafes and 
restaurants. It is also close to the 
Sherlock Holmes museum. At the 
King's Cross rail station, Harry 
Potter fans can find Platform 9 3/4 
- a plaque commemorating this 
popular children's book character 
has actually been placed between 
Platform 9 and Platform 10. 
Nearby is the British Library, home 
of the Magna Carta, a Gutenberg 
Bible, Shakespeare's "First Folio" 
and musical manuscripts by Handel 

and Paul McCarmey. You can even 
hear sound clips of people like 
Florence Nightingale and Virginia 
Woolf. If you enjoy nature, walk up 
the Hampstead Heath in nonhero 
London and take in a view of the 
city. 

Theater buffs hoping to enjoy 
some of the best productions in 
the world will be happy to know 
that some of the most popular 
shows, including "Les Miserables" 
and "Phantom of the Opera," can 
be discounted up to 50 percent for 
students. Just show up at the the-

can also go to the TKTS half-
price ticket booth in Leicester 
Square. This is the only official 
half-price ticket booth in London, 
which has tickets available for the 
current night's shows. At other 
attractions, ask about student dis-
counts and show your student TO. 

When your stomach starts 
growling, try some pub grub, 
which can include anything from 
the traditional fish and chips to 
baguette sandwiches. Also keep in 
mind that London's multiethnic 
makeup is definitely reflected in its 
food. Sample the most popular 
"English" cuisine, which includes 
Indian food, due to the large num-
ber ofSoum Asian immigrants pre-
sent in London. Also popular (and 
relatively inexpensive) eating 
options available include Chinese, 
Thai and Mediterranean food, 
which reflect that according to the 
United Kingdom's Office for 
National Statistics, ethnic minori-
ties comprise over 40 percent of 
London's population . 

Popular shopping areas include 
Oxford Street, High Street 
Kensington and Covent Garden. 
Oxford Street is arguably the 
busiest street in Europe, and is 
best known for department stores 
and other big-name multinational 
boutiques and stores. 1 Iigh Street 
Kensington offers shopping at 
several international stores like 
Urban Outfitters, a well as at 
local boutiques. If you are looking 
for a more alternative shopping

Even though Londoners speak 
the same language that you do, 

they will occasionally use unfamil-
iar jargon. But pan of the fun of 
London is gaining this Ilew vocab-
ulary. You know you want to come 
back to the United States saying 
"Cheerio" and "let's chuck it in 
the bin." Also, look to the right 
before eros ing the street (you 
Illay be reminded of it at cro s-
walks) because cars are on the left 
side of the road. Drivers are not 
friendly to pedestrians. 

To further prepare for your trip. 
invest in a travel guide such as 
"Let's Go 2004: London" that is 
great for budget-savvy travelers, or 
" Rick Steves' London." an 
American rraveler 's take on 
London and enctly how ro easily 
navigate one's way through every-
thing offered in the bustling ci ty. 
They are both priced at abuut $1 7,

have an adventure.

Road trip: Many insights to be found 
continued from page 10 

Sometimes you don't want to 
be losl. There is no shame in 
admitting it. It is also a good con-
versation starter with the locals. 

6. Read signs 
Signs are helpful for keeping 

on track with driving. Often good 
for a laugh as well. 

7. Visit people 
Rack your brains for distant 

relatives and casual acquaintances 
you can stay with or at least visit 
along the way. It adds a lot to the 
trip. 

8. When you feel like stop-
ping, do so 

If something catches your eye 
or you just need a brea k, pull off 
the ro~d . You won't regret it. 

9. Refuel before you are on 
empty 

This practice is better for 
your car, better for your sanity. 
This will save you unnecessary 
trouble. Living life this way will 
keep you healthier and happier as 
well. 

10. The windier the road, 
the better 

Fun to drive and a great per-
specove on life. 

II . Brush and floss at least 
once a day and shower often 

This should be obvious. Think 
- many people in a confined 
space for long periods of time. 
Enough said . 

12. Appreciate delays 
Remember, roads wouldn 't 

exist witham road construction. 
13. Bring maps 
AAA is an inval uable resource. 

If you don't have a membership, 
find someone who doe . 

14. Don't pass up cheap gas 
No matter how much you 

think the next station will be 
cheuper, cheap gas is cheap gas. 

The next gas station will be more 
expensive. 

lSa. Travel light 
Less is more. If you're not 

su re if yo u ' ll use it, don't take it. 
You can always pick one up on 
the road 

1 Sb. You can never have too 
much underwear 

The one exception to 15a. 
16. Stop before you feel tired 
Driving tired is the worst way 

to drive and one of the most dan-
gerous. Don't do it. Life is better 

" No matter how much 
you want to, don't pet the 

L __ " 
ucars. 

when you are well rested. You're 
on vacation, remember? 

17. There's always time for a 
sunset 

No matter where you are or 
what you're doing, take a moment 
to enjoy the beauty of nature. 

18. No matter how much 
you want to, don't pet the bears 

All aro und good advice. 
19. The fastest road isn't 

alw.ays the best road 
Enjoy yourself, visit small 

towns and get off the highway. 
Nicer driving and more interest-
ing sights are worth the added 
time. 

20. Don't plan the details 
Details can rarely be planned

deal. They offer a wide variety of 
passes depending on your needs. 
Some offer unlimited t r avel for a 
certain period of ti m e, while 
others are genred for those trav-
eling on ly a few times. But even 
if you have a Eurail Pass, it is 
often a good idea [Q make reser-

around foreign cities and si pping

A difficult task on a trip. but 

vital. Whether hiking the Grand 
Canyon, or doing sit-ups on pic-
nic tables, it's always possible and 
adds to the experience. 

2 S. Don't speed 
Speeding is just not worth it. 

Getting a ticket is the last thing 
you want to do on your vacation. 

26. Have • journal and use it 
Keeping a journal is a nice way 

to look back on your journeys and 
your life. You'll never regret the 
time it takes to write down your 
thoughts. 

27. Bring a an opener 
h's hard to open cans without 

one. 
28. Drink the water 
No matter what you have 

been told, the water won't kill 
you. It tastes different every-
where you go. Drink a lot, it's 
good for you. 

29. Check in 
With yourself, your family, 

travel companions and the car. 
Crucial for a well-oiled trip. 

30. The journey is the desti-
nation 

"[his is an important mentality

Flights: Take 
advantage of 

low fares 
continued from pagl! I I 

nies are feeling the pinch and have 
started to lower prices. 

J Jere are some things to 
remember if a traveler is consider-
ing low-cost airlines: 

Some carriers ny to airports that 
are quite far from the city. C heck 
the cost and time it will take to get 
from the airport to the heart of the 
city. 

There is no Orbitz.com that 
can search all the discount airlines 
in Europe, and many of the airlines 
have limited routes. It can take a 
long time and a touch of creativity 
to take full advantage of the low-
cost flights. A lot at' airlines have 
hubs at the different airports in 
London. Try and avoid having to 
make the journey from one airport 
to another. It is costly and time 
consuming.

increased their prestige with five 
champions and a winning relay, five 
Second Team honorees, and 12 
Honorable Mentions awarded. 

By the final day of competition, 
Chico State earned its first-ever 
womens crown with 196.5 points

bers of both teams will earn 2004 

CM Championship berths. In 
2003, the men 's team was unrepre-
sented at the meet while three 
members of the women's team were 
elected to race in Edwardsville, Ill. 
All three returned from the meet as 
All-Americans.

MONDAY, MAY 17,2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Baseball: Four honorees return for 2005 season 
continued from ~ 010 

"Ricky has been a great addi-
tion to the program," O'Brien 
said. "He is a true ballplayer and 
loves the game." 

Defensively, Pinocchio turned 
39 double plays and led the team 
with 288 catches. 

~I was a little shaky on defense 
in the first half of the season," 
Pinocchio said. "[ think that I was 
able lO step it up in the second 
half and make an impact on the 
team ," 

Clark showed his versatility 
this year for head coach O'Brien. 
Clark, designated as an infielder, 
spent time at second base, in left 
field and as designated hitter. He 
batted .292 and knocked 56 hits, 
including nine doubles and a 
homc run. Clark scored 33 times 
and drove in 52 RBI. 

Burton came on strong toward 
the end of the regular season. He 
led the team with a .394 batting 
average and accounted for 23 runs 
on the year. Burton notched 37 
hits, including nine doubles, three 
tri pies and a home run. 

"Brett has come a long way, 
both on and off the field, in the 
last three years," O'Brien said. 

"He continues to improve in both 
areas and is an exciting player who 
was able lO spark this team at any 
time during a game or a series." 

Navarro, the only TrilOn pitch-
er to garner conference honors, 

" I'm very proud of] eff and 
all that he represents in 

our program. " 
- o.n O'Brien. 
lINd CDICh. 

bll .... 

led the staff with a j .89 earned run 
average and a 6-2 record. He 
threw 88 innings and struck out a 
team-high 62 batters. 

"Learning to trust my defense 
was a big accomplishment for 
me," Navarro said. "That is some-
thing I struggled with last year. 
This year, I tried to get hitters to 
get themselves out and let the 
defense back me up." 

Navarro was also one of 12 

players named to the All-CCAA 
Tournament Team. He went 
eight innings in the Triton's first-
ever conference tournament 
game, earning the win in 
UCSD's 6-2 upset of top-seeded 
defending CCAA champion 
Sonoma State. 

Even with the numbers he put 
up this season, Navarro was sur-
prised to have been named to the 
CCAA Third Team. 

"I was really surprised [that I 
was honoredl," Navarro said. "I 
definitely wasn't expecting it. l just 
went out there and basically did 
my job this year. I counted on the 
other guys to back me up, and as a 
result of their help, the conference 
recognized my pitching." 

With four of these honorees 
returning to UCSD next year, 
they are looking to improve. 

"vVe need to continue to never 
be satistled and to get better 
everyday," Pinocchio said. 

Navarro agreed. 
"Looking toward next season, 

we JUSt need to remain confident," 
Navarro said. "We need to contin-
ue to trust ourselve and our abili-
ties, and if we do, we can do any-
thing we set our minds to."

fourth day to finish with a 74, the 
third best round for the Tritons in 
the tournament, giving him a final 
score of 305. He finished overall in 
a tie for 27th place. 

"Every time I started to get on a 
roll, something went wrong," 
Duckworth said. "I had a couple 
good stretches where I thought I 
could get something going, but I 
would always hit a wall - get a 
double bogey or miss a putt. We 
still had a great year overall as a 
team though." 

Corning in second for UCSD 
was junior Joe Dolby, coming off a 
solid eighth-place performance at 
the NCAA Regionals . Dolb)' started 
off great on May 12 with a 73, lover 
par, the lowest round of the day for 
thc Tritons. uffering some in the 
second and third rounds, he turned 
in twO consecutive 79s. Dolby came 
back on .\'Ia)' IS to shoot a 76; 4 over 
par, which was enough to give him a 
four round-total of 307 and a tic for 
41st place. 

TIlird up for UCSD was sopho-
more R),o Yamada, who finished in a 
tie for 66th place. Yamada started 
strong with a 77 on May 12 and a 75 
on May 13, but faltered some on 
May 14 and May 15, nlrning ill two 
traight Is to bring hiS total t() 314. 

"Man, the cour~e was playing 
tough," Yamda said. "I think we 
got beat because wc didn't know 
the greens. They're completely 
different from West O.lst green~, 
and wc just couldn't get used to 
dlem with our putting. \,ve didn 't 
bring our best game, but the s(()rCS 
were not indicative of how we 
played ; the elements, including the 
grass and a duwnpour on ,\1a)' 15, 
really got [0 us." 

Scheer who, like Dolby, was rid-
ing an eighth-place finish at rcgion-
als, came in fourdl for the ' ll-ilOns. 

Despite a rocky start on May 12 
with an 80, Scheer turncd in the 
lone par for UCSD on May 13 and 
looked as if he had found his groove. 

"In the second round, I really 
managed to keep the ball in pla:v," 
Scheer said. "I didn't have any con-
fidence playing with a foreign dub, 
and it spread to my whole game; I 
wasn't able t() make;! anything." 

However, in light of his driver 
problems, Scheer managed to mrn 
in the very respectable scores of !l3 
and 82 011 May 14 and ,\lay 15 , 
respectively, to finish with ,I 317. 
This earned him a tie for 74th place. 

"The course was awesome," 
Scheer said. ,·It got a little rainy on 
May IS, but nothing too bad. All in 
all it was a great week and lots of 
nln . From here 1'\1\ hoping til qual -
ity for U.S. Amateur aga\ll this 
summer, and I'll also be competing 
in the an Diego Amateurs." 

Rounding dlings out for CS D 
was sophomore Justin Gr'lOt, who 
missed RCboionals due to a bum with 
vertigo. Grant posted rounds of 2, 
80, 77 and 82 across dle four days. 
He finishell with a four-round final 
scort! of 3 21, which earned him a tic 
for 85th place overall. 

"We don't see [Bermuda grass] 
much, so ir wa very hard to get a 
re,ld on the greens," Grant s'lld . " It 
was hard to lil1lsh like thi~ , m nsitier-

UCSD eliminated at Nationals 
Men's tennis falls to West Florida in round of 16 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

T he UC 0 men's tennis teall) 
saw ItS season come to a close on 
May 12 with a 5-2 first-round loss 
aga inst o. 2 West Florida in the 
N CAA D ivis io n II N a tional 
C hampi onship Round of 16 held 
in Almmon te prings, Fla . After 
secunng a 2- 1 lead in doubles, the 
T riton. were unable to tave off a 
comeback from West Fl o r ida, 
who look four straight si ngles 
matches to advance 111 the to urna-
ment . 

The Tritons, continuing their 
solid doubles play, took two of 
three matches to gain an ea rl y 2- 1 
lead over the Argonauts. At No.2 
double, senior Amir NeJad and 
junior Bryan wart pai red up to 
defeat Pauliu J urkena and M ario 

ergara, -5. t o. 3, enior 
, Ick " l orton and soph o more 
Brent ,\ lolden defea ted lui ll ame 
de erbl7.e and Jonas Mouly, -6. 
But No. I doubles, eniors J eff 
\Nilson :lnd ameer ho pra, 
ranked econd in doubles in 
D IvisIOn If, dropped their match 
to Radovan hrz and German 
Delmagro, -2 . 

"We had a good start in dou-
bles," UCSD head coach Eric 
Steldlmayer sa Id. "Our N o.2 and 
No.3 doubles teams played well 
wi th lot of energy and emo tion. 
V\'e were excIted Ito take an early 
lead\ ." 

1 Iowever, the Argonaut came 
right back in si ngles, qui ckJy tak-
ing three matche in straight sets 
to steal the lead from the Tritons. 
W ilson 10 t, 6-0, 6-2, to hrz. at 

No.3 singles and Morton lost, 6-
2, 6-2, to Vergara at No. 6. West 
Florida took a 4-2 lead when 
M olden lost a very tight match to 
Malagro, 7-5, 7-5. 

Despite losing its lead, UCSD 
kept things tight, stretching the 
other matches to a third set. West 
Florida proved to be toO much for 
the Tri tons, however, as J urkenas 
defeated a fatigued and cramping 
Chopra , 6-7, 7-6, 6-2, to clinch 
the victory for the Argonauts, 5-2. 

"Sameer hopra was in the 
best shape of his life coming into 
tru s march," Ste idl mayer said. '' It 's 
hard to know if he would've won, 
but he played hi s heart Ollt." 

At I 0.2, watt and de Verbize 
each took a set; Swatt was down 5-
4 in the third before his match was 
ha lted. At No. 4, N ovak and 
Mouly also each won a set, and 
Novak was down 4-2 in the third 
before his match was halted. 

"We concentrated well ," 
teidlmayer said. "We t Flo rida 

just had more depth because they 
had players ranked in the top five. 

Dt t' I 

West Florida played well, a little 
better than us." 

Despite its first-round loss, 
UCSD accomplished much 
throughout its season . Seniors 
Chopra and Wilson maintained a 
No. 2 ranking in doubles while 
Chopra, Swatt and Novak were 
ranked in the top 50 for singles. 
Each attained their highest rank-
ings with Chopra at No. 13, Swan 
at No. 17 and Novak at No. 39. 

The Tritons reached Nationals 
for the first time in Division II. It 
had been II years since their last 
trip to Nationals in Division III. In 
addition, UCSD finishes the year 
ranked ninth, its highest ranking 
since entering Division il in 2000. 

"I really thought we played to 
our ability this year," Steidlmayer 
said . "The goal was to play good 
in the playoffs, and I liked how 
they tried hard . It's been a season 
of firsts with three guys ranked in 
the top 50 for the first time, hav-
ing IC hopra and Wilson] ranked 
second in doubles, and making it 
to nationals." 

Golf finishes 15th at NCAA's 
Scheers driver head cracks, hinders UCSD perfonnance 

By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

For the first time since moving 
to Division II in 2000, the UCSD 
golf team took part in the Division 
II National Championships, held 
at the Victoria Hills Golf Course 
in DeLand , Fla. , May 12 through 
.\1ay IS, placing 15th in a tield of 
18 teams. 

" It was a pretty hard course, 
but we really suffered from some 
extenuating circumstances," head 
coach Mike Wydra said . "We had 
to change for playing on Bermuda 
grass, which is a very different act-
ing grass, and we had trouble 
making adjustments, especially 
our players who had never played 
on it before." 

T he primary extenuating cir-
cumstance that plagued UCSD was 
senior team ca pta in Alan Scheer's 
driver head cracking. T his forced 
him to usc a driver from the pro 
shop fo r his third and fourth 
rounds, after which he could not 
fin d hl~ stride agai n, despite coming 
off a ~econd-rou nd score of 72 . 

"We tried to have a new driver 
shipped in through an alumni con-
nection with MacG regor, but the 
cl ub arrived too late," Wydra sai d. 
" I Le played a~ well as he could 
without the proper equi pment in 
his third and fOllrth rounds, but 
thi s \Va~ just terrible for our 
senior. l ie didn't deserve anything 
like this to happen to him." 

C:S[)\ tcam cores were 
severely raised as a rcsult of cheer's 

equipn~ent failures, and the peren-
nia l top-three finIsher was relegated 
to the four spot on the team.

Tough shot: Joe Dolby shot a four-round total of 307 and finished 41 st at the 
NCAA DIvision II National Championships for men's golf in Florida. 

UCSD managed to put togeth-
er two rounds that would have 
yielded it a top- 10 fini sh, shooting 
scores of 307 and 303 , 19 and 15 
over par, respectively. However, 
things started to deteriorate on 
M ay 14, when UCSD put up 3 14, 
and on May 15 when the T ritons 
posted 313. UC D 's four-round 
total was 1,237, 85 over par, still 
close to nett ing a top- 10 Hni h. 

"AI's driver problem bro ught 
everyone down," vVydra saicl. 
"The mora le of the tea m was rea l-
ly lowered." 

lndividually, UC SD was led by 
junior standout Brian Duckworth, 

corning off a 10th-place finish at 
the CM Regional match . 
Duckworth was nothing but consis-
tent in rus first three rounds, post-
ing three straight 77s, 5 over par. 

" I'm really disappointed ," 
Duckworth said . "We worked 
hard all year, and had some great 
fini shes, and then to come Out at 
Nationdls and have one of our 
wOrst fini shes of the year, it wa 
just rea ll y disappo inting. T his was 
a to ugh course, but eve ryone 
knows we could have done better. "

The UCSD women's track and 
field team finished second and the 
men's team went home with third-
place honors after rebounding 
from early deficits on May 15, the 
final day of competition at the 2004 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships at Cal 
State Los Angeles' Jesse Owens 
Track. Individuals on both teams 
now await the May 18 release of 
the final field of competitors for 
the 2004 NCM Division II 

Championships. 
Although Chico tate managed 

to snag conference titles in both 
the men's and women ' bracket, the 
Tritons made an impres ive effort 
to narrow the margin between 
UCSD and its opponents. 

The women's team clo ed the 
gap from a 31-point Chico tate 
lead on May 14, coming within 18 
at 178.5 total points, but further 
attempts to close the gap were 
unsuccessful.

Baseball earns six 
conference honors 

Pitcher Jose Navarro selected 
to All-Tournament Team 
By COURTNEY FIELD 

Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD baseball's senior co-cap-
tain catcher/first baseman Jeff 
Riddle, junior co-captain shortstop 
Keith Hernandez, junior second 
baseman Ricky Pinocchio and 
junior utility player Joel Clark were 
each named to the All-California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Second Team. Senior outfielder 
Brett Burton and sophomore pitch-
er Jose Navarro were named to the 
A11-CCAA Third Team. Navarro 
was also named to the CCAA A11-
10urnament Team. The confer-
ence honors are the first for 
Pinocchio, Clark, Burton and 
Navarro. This is the second time 
that Riddle and Hernandez have 
earned CCM honors. 

Riddle led the 2004 team with 
56 RBr, 19 doubles and five home 
runs. I [e batted .348, accounted for 
38 runs, put up 71 hits and drew 38 
walks. Defensively, he led the team 
with 257 put-outs. 

"Jeff is a good player, but an 
even bette r person, and that is say-
ing a lot considering how good he 
is between the lines," UCSD head 
coach Dan O 'Brien said . "He is 
always solid, and I'm very proud of 

how hard he has worked to develop 
into a solid all-around player. He is 
a very strong but agile defensive 
catcher who drives the ball to all 
fields. I'm very proud ofJeff amI all 
that he represents in our program." 

Hernandez was a CCAA 
Honorable Mention in 2003. In 
2004, Hernandez broke the single-
season Triton hits record with 85. 
Hernandez started all 59 games this 
season, the only Triton to do so. He 
had a .351 average, hit 12 doubles, 
and had two triples. Hernandez 
scored 43 times and had 32 RBI. 

"Keith has been a big part of our 
team's success because he brings 
consistency to the most important 
defensive position on the field," 
O'Brien said. "I Ie is the model 
player for our program - he works 
hard, stays consistent, makes plays, 
swings the bat well, and plays well 
under pressure ." 

Pinocchio had the fourth -high-
est batting average on the 2004 
team behind only Riddle, 
Hernandez and Burton . lIe hit 
.3 23 on the year, and had 64 hits, 
16 doubles, four triples, three 
home runs and 29 RBI. Pinocchio 
led the team in runs scored with 51.
