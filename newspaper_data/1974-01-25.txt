Town Center Controversy Continues 
City Cou ncil to 

Decide Issue Feb. 6 
by Linda King 

"A second feature which makes UCSD a 'specia l' 
place is its ' mall-co llege st ructure' ... The plann rs were 
aware that many student prefer uch an intimate, 
informal setting to the crowded, hurly-burly world of 
the big ci ty campus". This is a quote from UCSD's 
Genera l Cata log for 1974-1975, that proceeds five pages 
of descriptions of the 'beautifu l s tting' of the campus. 
However some tudents are on erned that thi etting 
may be threatened by the proposed Univer ity Town 
C nter. 

On rebruary 6th the San Diego City Counci l is 
scheduled to vote on the proposed Univ rsity Town 

enter to be located on the southeast quadrant of 
Gene e and La Jolla Village Dr.

major department store and between 8D-100 mail er 
retail store . Ph a II , which would begin construction 
In 1977 would include restaura nts, movie theaters, 
bank and ome 'cultural facilities' . The third and final 
phase of the project, which is scheduled to begin 
con truction in 1980, v.culd include 300,000 q. ft. of 
hotel and conference pace, compl tion of omm rcial 
and cultural facilities and a projected residential area to 
a commodate b tween 90,000-95,000 p op le. 

The concept of a University Town Center was in-
clud d in the University's Master plan when the plan 
called for twelve olleges . Th Town C nter was to 
fu lfill the need of the students and reflect the cu ltural 
atmo phere of the Unive.sity. However, the Ma ter Plan 
for UCSD wa revi sed in 1973 to include only four 
coli ge but the plans for th Town Center were not 
revised to reflect this change

CWHE: Tackling 
Problems of 

Women on Campus 
by Mary Howard 

The idea that women in 
higher education have 
similar needs and problems 
is not new. In recent years, 
many conferences have 
been held on the subject 
but, until now, no attempt 
has been made to integrate 
women in higher education 
in California on a local 
level. This is the purpose of 
California Women in Higher 
Education . 

The beginnings of the 
organization can be traced 
back to a meeting in San 
Diego early last year . This 
led to a subsequent meeting 
at Irvine in December, 1973 
with Wendy Pederson and 
Mary Walshok, both from 
the University Extension, 
and Jane Frazer, a member 
of the Affirmative Action 
advisory Committee , at-
tending from this campus. 
Bylaws and the blueprint 
for the- structure of 
California Women in Higher 
Education were products of 
this meeting. 

Ideally, each college-
level cmapus throughout 
California would have three 
representatives to a 
retlonal group. Here, a 
forum would be provided 
for discussion of local 

" 

I I 

problems which could be a 
result of legislation from 
Sacramento . Information 

.from these regional groups 
would then be sent to 
lobbyists in Sacramento, 
although as yet , California 
Women in Higher 
Education has no lobbyist. 

Until this structure can 
be implemented, there are 
u nofti cia I representatives, 
four each from the U. C. 
system, the state coUeges, 
community colleges, and 
minority women. Two of 
each four are from the 
north and two are from the 
south . Jane Frazer at this 
campus is one represen-
tative of the U. C. system, 
south . 

According to Wendy 
Pederson, who attended the 
Irvine conference in 
December, California 
Women in Higher 
Education may be seen in a 
different light from other 
women/s gr9ups. Many 
women in higher education, 
she claims, have 
traditionally resisted a f-
filiation with these groups 
because of an apparent 
political philosophy, . or a

Academic Senate 
Rejects Proposal 

by James Soto 
The UCSD Academic Senate voted Tuesday to oppo e 

the exi ting d veloper's plan for a Univer ity Town 
ent r . 
The Senate by a voice vote ac epted the report of the 

Executive and Policy Committ e (EPC) whi h pOinted 
out the failure of the developer's plan to meet ertain 
crit ria before conti nuing with the nevelopment of th 
Town center (to be located on the 106 acre east of the 
UniverSity near th intersection of Genesse and La Jolla 
Village Dr). 

The four major objections raised by the EPC report 
were con cerned with housing, size and sca le, tran-
sportation and noi e and afety. 

The report of the EPC pointed out that ad quate 
housing in all price ranges was not now available. 
Several members of the senate felt that it was necessary 
to make any new housing available to the tudent and 
low-income employees at the University to insure that 
the new development would become part of the 
University. 

The written report of the committee aid " too large a 
developm nt would lack pede trian orientation and 
would attract unsuitable commercial uses and greatly 
increa e traffi c problems " 

There was considerable concern expres d by the 
enate in the di ussion that followed on the traffic 

problem. There was a general feeling supported by 
reports by a number of consulting firm reports that 
many of the traffic arterials serving the ca mpus were 
near the saturation point if not there already. It was 
believed that the Town Center would only compound 
an already serious problem 

The location of the proposed development falls 
partially within an area subjected to a large amount of 
noise froni Miramar NAS an area of potentially high risk 
from falling aircraft . 

James Arnold , chairman of th EPC and Herbert Stern, 
chairman of the San Diego Academic enate em-
phasized the influence of the enate on the community 
because of the large pool of professional expertise 
found in the University. Stern pointed to a letter 
received by the Senate from an Diego mayor Pete 
Wil son thanking the Senate for the cooperation and 
assistance to the City Council in the recent hearings

Bust Attem pt at M IIi r: 
What Really Happened? 

by Ed Simons 

Friday, January the 18th, 
witnessed the christening of 
the Muir North parking lot 
with what may have been 
its first gunshot. 

Around noon that day, 
Cleo Malone was tipped off 
about a dope deal being 
made on Tenaya Hall's 
eight floor . Malone is Muir 
College's Resident Dean. 

Malone claims that he 
went to the room in 
question . He found four 
persons in the room seated 
at a table. On the table 
were several ounces of 
marijuana. Later, Malone 
estimated it to be about 
eight " Iids". Malone said 
that three of the people 
were UCSD students and 
the other one was not. 
Apparently, one of the 
students was attempting to 
make a sale to the non-
student. 

The non -s tudent 
panicked and ran, followed 
by the student . Cleo 
Malone gave chaw Clnd got 
as far a!i the parking lot 
north of Tenaya. 1\) he W.lS 

coming over the little ri se 
before the lot, he claims 
that a shot was fired at him . 
He did not see who fired the 
gun . 

Police were informed of 
the chase and arrived on 
the scene to investigate. 
They then learned of the 
gunshot . Further in -
vestigations and interviews 
on campus could produce 
no evidence to substantiate 
the discharge of a weapon 
in the area . 

Officers admitted to 
speculating that the sound 
that Malone heard could 
have been caused by the 
construction taking place to 
the east of the gym . 
Nothing could be proved 
one way or the other, 
however . The (ampus 
Police Department is till

the dealer and buyer. 

Malone remains adamant 
in his claim that he was 
fired upon and adds that in

The Streaking Fad 
(CPS) Swallowing goldfish, stuffing phone booths, 

and smoking dope can't compare to the latest college 
fad-streaking-<>r runn ing around in the nude. 

At the University of Maryland (UM) at College Park 
this past-time has become particularly evident, 
although according to the campu s police chief only one 
nude runner has been arrested so far this year. The 
runner was changed with assault and disorderly conduct 
after hitting a resident director who tried to make him 
go inside. 

The record for mass running in the nude was set at 
UM by about 125 sprinters, mostly male, who cir-
culated a dining hall while spectators urged them on 
_with shouts, music and firecrackers . 

A group of coeds claim they held the most bizarre 
nude event, a mock weddkng in which the participants 
wore only hats and headdresses . 

One student claims he started the nude activities by 
taking off his pants in front of a girl 's dormitory. 

"It wasn 't premeditated," he notes "We just decided 
to do it after we got drunk one night at a mixer." 

The activity is not limited to colleges. Time magazine 
reports that Los Angeles housewives are prone to 
shedding their clothes and loping off into the coo l 
California night. Few streakers are reported to police, 
who are not overly concerned anyway, Time says. But 
passers-by have been shaken up by the spectacle severa l 
times in the paa few weeks and no one knows where the 

,streakers migh . streak next.

Legislation ntroduced by Assemblyman Lawrence 

Kapiloff (D-S In Diego) to permit women more 
discretion in t Ie way they register to vote passed the 
Se nate today by a vote of 22 to 1. 

Under Kapil:>ff's legislation (AB 765), a woman may 
use her name Nithout a title or she may choose to use 
Miss, Mrs. or ' .-1s. The title a woman chooses to use or 
not use is entirely discretionary. 

Under present law, a woman must precede her name 
with the pref ix Miss or Mrs. on voter registration forms. 

"I believe the present interpretat ion of the law is an 
infringement of a woman's rights ," Kapi loff said. "Why 
should we require women to make statements relative 
to their marital status that we don't require of m nr"

CAL .. PIRG To Study 
Elected Officials 

by Rick Drom 

How can a person ever hope to become familiar with 
his elected officials and their real actions? 

CALPIRG, the California Public Interest Research 
Group, is showing the way through its " Legislative 
Profiles Project". Patterned after Ralph Nader's famous 
study of Congress, this study aims to explore the voting 
records, connections and political careers of San Diego 
officials . 

This major projec t will begin next week with students 
from five universities in the San Diego area par-
ticipating. This project will examine the members of the 
C-<>unty Board of Supervisors, the state assemblymen, 
and state senators in San Diego . Detailed, in-depth 
profiles of each incumbent will be published and 
distributed by CALPIRG before the june primaries . 
Similar profiles will be done on the City Councilmen 
before the November election . 

The purpose of the project is to inform the public of 
the actual political careers of these officials in order to 
make government more respons ive to the people. These 
profiles will include a history of the officials' voting 
records, their attendance records and all their relations 
to special interest groups. Great care will be taken to 
keep these studies impartial , factual and non-partisan. 

Students at -many of the colleges will do these 
research projects as part of their political science or 
journalism classes ; many will receive class credit for 
their work on this project . 

After this info rmation has been accumulated and 
double-checked it will be published for the public . 
Copies will be available in ci ty and school libraries and 
additiunal copies will be sent to the media. 

Any UCSD student interested in working on this 
study, or professor interested in sponsoring such a 
study, should call Alan Friedman at 459-9411 . Ad-
ditional information can also be obtained by cal ling 
Dan Franklin, CALPI RG director, at 236-1509 during the 
day .

18-0 vote decided not to endorse the Center Campus 
groups such as the Undergraduate Student Council , The 
Graduate Student Council , and the Academic Senate 
came out against the U.T.C. 

The Chancellor then appointed the Chancellor's 
Advisory Committee on University Community, which IS 
composed of four Vice Chancellors, four faculty 
members, and two students one of which IS Marco 
LiMandri . It is the purpose of this committee to review 
the University Master Plan and advise the Chancellor. 
The committee is headed by Dr. Clifford Crobstein . 

At the Nov. 6th meeting of the San Diego City Council 
the U .T.C. developers announced that the project was 
to be reduced from the proposed 300 acres to the 
presently proposed 106 acres. ThiS drastic reduction 
caused the City Council to postpone thE' meeting until 
Feb . 6th The revised plan was then submitted to the 
City of San Diego Environmental Quality Department 
which stated that "The development of a project of this 
size in a heretofore unurbanized area uses up open 
space. Such urbanization would seriously impact the 
ability of the Naval Air Station to operate with minimal 
hazard to citizens. ew urbanized areas would make 
the attainment of federal and state air quality standards 
more difficult and place a greater burden on the region 
as a whole." 

It also gave the following reasons for non-support , 
l)direct conflict with the adopted University Plan, 2) 
conflict with the general plan for San Diego, 3) ac-
celerating the growth rate in the University and orth 
City Area, 4) Social impact from not prOViding for 
housing until 1980 and then only in l imited numbers 111 
the upper price range, 5) burden on city facilities , 6 ) 
increase in tra ffic , 7) air quality control. 

When asked what UCSD students could do to in-
fluence the decision of the San Diego City Council 
Marco LiMandri suggested letters to the San Diego City 
Counci l and attendance at the Feb 6th meeting. For 
students wishing more information, Cal Pirg is spon-
soring a teach-in on the University Town Center on Jan. 
30 in the Reve lle Cafeteria at 7:30. Guest speakers will i n~'ude developer Bernie Spector, and City Planning 
Member Ken Klein.

An Open Letter 
To Muir College 

by Gene Eastman 

Up until January ninth of this year, we had a concord 
with Cleo Malone, the University, and the San Diego 
police concerning our privacy. That harmony has now 
been severed and we no longer have the privacy that 
used to exist. This was apparently due to the fact that 
some students left 'plants' in their windows over 
Christmas vacation and the fact that some of these same 
students decided not to keep their parties private as 
seen in incidents where students have brought their 
plants out into the lounges and have had their parties in 
their lounges. 

Hang In There, Mr. President 

Now, as of January 19th of this year , the gentlemen's 
agreement that existed between Muir and the San Diego 
police has been severed as Cleo explained partially at 
the dance of the same day. "We will no longer 'pol ice 
our own' as Cleo explained to us at the beginning of the 
school year. W e can now expect to see the San Diego 
police (in addition to the campus police) patrolling 
around the campus looking for marijuana, and drugs, 
busting people, but more importantly, disturbina our 
community. 

by Henry Tobias 
This is all due to many factors which I have described, 

and others which the res ident dean's office is not 
making public . We might also consider another reason 
why the gentlemen's agreement that kept the harmony 
of our campus alive wa broken. It seems obvious that 
one of the two parties, if not both, broke the intangible 
contract at one ti me or..another. By the fact that the San 
Diego police were around t he campus during Chri tmas 
break indicates that they broke the agreement. Cleo, in 
add ition, by not adequatel y 'policing h is own' broke the 
contract also. 

Hang in there, Mr President; Fight! Fight! Fight! 
We are with you, Mr. President, With all our might. 
They may use you and abuse you, Holler quit, quit, quit; 
But you've heard that all before, Just clench your fist 
and grit. 
You've got courage, so just reach 'em And fight! Fight! 
Fight! 

OJ. 
by Hank Steiman 

In the beginning, there was COD. And as the story 
goes, God created The Heaven, The Earth, and Two-man 
Volleyball, all in six days, and then on the seventh day 
He rested. However, what many people don't rea lize is 
that on that day of rest, Cod did something else which 
has since greatly altered the course of man's existence 
and has also rather profoundly influenced my own life. 
On that well-deserved day of rest, Cod sat down and 
made some Orange Juice. That's right, folks! The 
greatest drink that has ever passed by my gums. I can't 
begin to tell you what orange juice means to me. 
Drinking orange Juice is like listening to Carole King sing 
or watching Henry Aaron hit home runs. It's one of 
those natural highs that I have joyfully experienced . 

Orange juice is tangy , scrumptious, zesty, and, 
besides that, it also tastes pretty good . In addition to 
drinking orange juice, I also bathe in it, shine my shoes 
with it, wash my laundry in it, and sometimes I even use 
O.J. as an aphrodisiac. It's truly an all-purpose drink . 

This quarter I haven't really been doing too much. 
I've been mostly staring off into space, or sining in my 
room reading the phone book , or just simply hanging 
around waiting for Ground Hog Day For fun , ome 
friends of mine like to get together, go into a dark room 
and then get loaded. As for me, I'm a little different. For 
fun , I enjoy going IOtO a dark room where I listen to " IN 
A GADDA DA VIDA" by Iron Butterfly (being played at 
78 rpm 's) , while Simultaneously drinking some olange 
juice (about a gallofl) , until I start belching out of 
control . One night last week I drank so much orange 
juice that I actually began to hallucinate! After pouring 
down six or seven quart bottles of orange juice, I then 
had a stra nge vision in which I was walking down a 
lonely street, and a II that time I had the strange feeling 
that I was being followed by DESI ARNAZ. 

Throughout history, orange juice has consistently 
been the most popular drink consumed by man. When 
Moses received the Ten Commandments at Mount 
Soledad, God also gave him a can of frozen orange juice 
as a token of good will. At the Last Supper, Jesus and his 
dinner guests finished off their meal with a tall glass of 
orange jUice . And, of course, we all remember film tar 
Jane Russt:d, who lad the biggest pair of oranges I've 
ever seen! Also, eVl 'ryone by now knows Patrick H nry's 
famous words, "C iv me orange juice or give me 
death l" 

Folks, I've been ,wite ups t re ently because due to 
President Nixon's wonderful econuillilo po!;;:ies (,,"riff 
Phase V we' ll probably all be eating ALPO), the pr ice of 
orange juice has s::yrocketed . I've been forced to go 
underground in oreel' to get my supply . But as long as I 
can have my glas; of freshly-squeezed orange juice 
every morning, I'll be grateful 

In closing, I w,)u ld like to say " Cod bless Bing 
Crosby." Because, if it wasn't for the "Old Honcho" and 
h is wonderful Minute Maid Orange Juice commerCials, 
promoting the world 's greate~t drink, I don't know what 
I would do. 

Well, gang, I've got to go now or else I' ll miss my 
Renaissance Art class. But before I go, I leave you with 
the famous words of Jack the Ripper who once aid: 
" YOIJ re Sixteen, you'r beautiful, and you're mine!" 

'0I,e 4 Triton Times, jinuuy 25, 1974 

Let them holler, " Let's impeach 'im!" They're wrong, 
you're right. 

Let them holler, let them cry . You just keep your head 
up high . 

So hang in there, Mr. President; Fight! Fight ! Fight ! 
Because of our resident dean, because of the S.D. 

police, and because of those few people who displayed 
their 'uncoolness' we can expect the San Diego police, 
and the narcs around anytime, anyplace, and anywhere 
they feel like, busting not only us, but into our rooms if 
they 'feel like it.' Because of the Supreme Court ruling 
on no-knock laws, the police need only probable cause, 
which in effect means reason to believe, without any 
evidence to back it up by, and their intrusions are 
answerable to no-one. Your room may be left in 
shambles, you may be man handled unduly, you may be 
interrupted during .. and they don't even have to knock _ 
they'll get the key to your room from Cleo and if they're 
mistaken, their only response will be "sorry for the 
inconvenience." 

Astounded 
Editor: 

I am frankly astounded at 
you r apparent lack of 
seriousness about a very 
important matter, and even-
more so by what looks like a 
concealed ' attempt to 
sati rize the situation . I am 
referring. to the so-called 
Nixton Speech (Jan. 18). 
The problem of abortion is 

.not an appropriate one to 
be used as materia l for a 
joke si nce som people 
firm ly believe that it is' 
murder and are offended by 
such a flippant article. The 
article seems to be at-
tempting a ridicule of these 
beliefs. 

I am sure that your 
answer would be that the 
words mentioning the 
possibility of severe birth 
def ct and a physician's 
advice in this matter were 
underlined to show that this 
was not taken I ightly and 
that concern was taken to 
respect the views of those 
who do not approve of 
abortion . 

Without getting into a 
debate on the morality of 
abortion in such cases, I 
wou ld on ly state that from 
the beginning of the article 
to the point where abortion 
is first mentioned, the tone 

is satirical and scoff in g. In 
an article o f this type, the 
tendency on the part of the 
reader is to continue 
reading with this tone in 
mind . Wh.,tever your true 
.IIvtlves in this matte r , the 
article leav es the im-
pression of an attempt to 
hold anti-abortion ideas up 
for ridicule. If this was not 
the intent of the writer, I 
suggest that a less vi tal 
si tuation be used in future 
articles, and that closer 
editi ng be done, 

Michael McManamon 

MeAT 
Dear Me, 

I thought that the ad for a 
professional MeAT 
preparation service in 
Tuesday's edition was in 
extraordi nari Iy poor taste. 
Such services do nothi ng to 
improve the selection of 
medical school applicants, 
and turn the cru cia l 
M ed ical Co llege Ad-
missions Test into an absurd 
farce, a measure of how 
much can be crammed in 
several weeks or months of 
preparation rather than a 
measure of the quality of 
l ife-long sc holar ly e n-
continued on palle 11 

For all of this I think we should give those few 
students, the S.D . police, and Cleo a big round of ap-
plause for helping to make Muir College a BETTER 
PLACE TO L1vn Peace and h armony to all of you!

Here we 10 with i collection of reprints from recent 
editions of the L.A. Times: 

Arab Women 
I remember a sophisticated Egyptian telling me how 

he " hatpe" or matchmaker, usually an old crone, 
t an es marriages and then before marriage deflow: rs ~~~ g~1 manually in front of .her. mother a~d mother-IO: 
law. It seems that if the girl IS not a virgen, an un 
derstanding hatpe will place some broken glass 10 ~he 
deflowering handkerchief to draw blood, thus savlO.g 
the girl 's reputation and very probably her life. If she IS 

.' the gl'rl 's father or brother would most not a virgin, 
robably kill her and go scot free. . 

p Ann then I remember the bright~yed , pretty I~ttle 8-
and 9-year-<>ld Fayed girls, who sat like eager sprites on 
the edge of the flowered sofas, while ~cross th~ room 
thei r 14- and 15-year old Fayed boy COUSIOS stood 10 self-
consc ious, budding manhood." h 

"Now, she is engaged to him, Mohammed Faxed, t e 
head of the family, explained solemnly, motioning fro~ 
one 8-year-<>ld to one 14-year-old ." And she. IS engage 

h· " He motioned to the two other children, who to 1m , .. 
beamed under the loving attention . 

For a moment, I felt I must be back in the epoch of 
the Prophet 1,400 years ago, when the most 
" romantic" thing in the world was to marry your cousin . 
But no, this was Cairo, in 1973, in the home of a modern 

fa~~~n would the children know about these 
arrangements? I asked. ,. k 

"Oh, not until they are 16 or 17: fe~!led Farou. 
Fayed another senior Fayed brother. Then their 
moth~rs will take them asi~e and tell them they are to 
marry this cousin or thaL ""1 

No revolt against the parents? No love . 
"Love .. . doesn't enter into it," Mohammed . Fayed! a 

husky, handsome man, explained with a self-,~Ise smile. 
"We think more about duty to our famely. . 

Romantic love, it seems, must come after o~ outSide 
of marriage, if it comes at all. Bu~ despite such 
unenlightened attitudes, the Fayeds, like most EgYPb 
tia ns, are far in advance of most North African Ara 
societies. , . 

ror example, in most North Afrtcan Arab countries, 
all of the body hai r on a woman IS pu l.led out Wlt~ a 
honey - and - water mixture before marriage, a practice 
that date to Cleopatra. ("We like our .women sleek, like 
snakes," one Egyptian told me) , And.1 n many areas t~e 
girl 's clitoris is removed either at birth or 10 barbarIC 

operation~ at about age 9 
Even sophis ti cated Arab men sti ll def~nd these 

practices. "But the clitoris must be removed,. a worldly 
Egyptian insisted. "Women here ar~ so p~sslo~ate , It IS 
the on ly way to keep them pure until marri age. 

And then I remember the ways men get around the 
boredom of association with the gi rl s who a.re k~Pt 
pure unti l marriage. Durin g the rule of the late libertine 
Ki ng Saud of Saudi Arabia, the f.avon.te ruse for ~en 
wi th money was bringing in English girls as magaz ine 
sa lesgi rls . ., I 

Si nce this is a country where the literacy rate. IS on y 
10%, one might assume these magazine salesgirls had 
another purpose. 

In Lebanon two years ago, a group of women lawyers 
proposed repeal of the " passion article .," und:r which a 
man may kill his wife on suspicion of infidelity and go 
scot free. h f th 

But leaders sat on the proposal and. t e men 0 e 
parliament have shown little interest 10 It. 

And so the barbarous practice by wh!ch most women 
so accuwd are knifed to d~ath by their 15- or 18-year-
o ld brothers continues . One hOrrible example se~er~1 
years ago involved a woman running along Beirut s 
cosmopolitan seafront. Her head was cut off by a self-
righteous male family member. . . 

These are some of the small VictOries .and the 
enormous conflicts that the educated and lO~en~ 
women of the Middle East are living and flghtlOg 
through. It is a confusing situatio~ . . , . 

Last summer, for instance, Libya s politically radical 
but socially reactionary PreSident Mo~mmar Khada~ 
spoke to hundreds of prominent Egyptian women an 
told them that women were often barr.:J from 
professional life bV three "defects ." These "defects" 
were virginity (a "defect," many listeners wryly .agr.eed 
afterwards that could easily be remedied early 10 life), 
menstruat{on and child-bearing. . 

"How" he asked with unassailable logic, "can a 
pregnani woman parachute?"

One day he was skipping

Occasionally Bonnie and Clyde had 
large sums of money on hand. But 
did they ever think of saving it at a 
bank? Not on their lives. Too bad 
they weren't eligible to be members 
of Univer.sity and State Employees 
Credit Union. Not only do the earn-
Ings on U.S.E. savings reach for the 
Iky (higher than any bank or sav-
Ings and loan passbook account). 

but they're insured just as safe . . . to 
twenty grand per account by the 
National Credit Union Administra-
tion. Now that's safe. 
So, if you're concerned about mak-
ing loot while you're saving iL .go 
to your bank or savings and loan for 
a large withdrawal. Then make your 
getaway to U.S.E. Just make sure 
it's your own money.

P.,e , Triton Timft, '.nu.Jry 25, 1974 

After the unfortunate demise of Crosby, Stills, Nash, 
and Young as a group, the solo careers that resulted 
captured great interest from listeners and reviewers 
alike. Personally speaking, of the resulting solo efforts 
that followed, it was Graham Nash's Son,s for Beginners 
which proved the most satisfying. The simplicity, 
cleanness, and accessibility ot its songs were far more 
rewarding than David Crosby's careful introspection, 
Stephan Stills' overworked efforts at capturing his own 
sty le, and Neil Young in general (though I must admit 
H.n/est was a strong, rich album). Nash scored again by 
being responsible for the more enjoyable half of the 
Gr.hlm Nash - Dnid Crosby LP 

With this strong foothold into the solo album field, it 
is with some regret that I listen to his latest effort Wild 
Tales. Gone is the simplicity and smooth melodic flow 
of songs like Simple M.n, and in their place is pedal 
steel and electric slide guitars, and a more stacatto sort 
of voca l which seems to mark the album. Throw in the 
harmonica (which he most certi\.inly does) and its no 
surpri se that this album sounds so very country-western. 

Now of course, it you like a more country-western 
type sound, this evolution of style (which began to show 
around the edges of his last album) should be quite 
pleasing, but I think i t really mi sses Nash's ca lling. It 
tends to sound like so many things we've all heard 
before. 

Indeed, the instrumenta l introduction to one cut, And 
So It Goes sounds exactly like Neil Young's Cowgirl in 
The Sand. 

Admittedly the album does have a way of growing on 
you, and the second side is far better than the first . I 
Miss You using on ly a piano and a bass is much more in 
line with the Nash of old, and is the best point on the 
album . 

There's nothing really wrong with Wild Tales except 
that the album is far more impersonal than Nash's 
previous. Songs For Beginners made me feel involved in 
the lyrics, while her ! cou ld on ly listen to them. The 
most interesting thing about the album was the inside of 
the record sleeve in which tiny red letters said " Hello! " I 
wish the rest of the album did. 

Senator Sam - At Home. Columbia K(32756 
Some things are better left unmentioned I suppose, 

but with the vinyl shortage you hear so much about 
running rampant, the time to speak out presents itself. 

Now I have no rea l political affiliations, and so 
couldn't even tell you for sure whether Senator Sam 
Erv in was a Democrat a Republi ca n, or what, but when 
it comes to making albums, I'm afraid he falls short on a 
number of counts. 

Now you may be wondering, what could a Senator do 
on a record album? Tell amusing stories? Recite poetry? 
Talk about his philosophies? Recite lyrics to popular 
songs? Well , believe it or not, Senator Sam does all this 
and more . 

OK . I'm first to admit he's got a certain charm. He 
comes on with this album carrying that kind of southern 

Art: Steve Gr.nt 

charisma so magnificently characterized by Andy of 
Mayberry. But hearing him recite the lyrics to Bridae 
aVe!' Troubled Water against a harmonica ac-
companiment could make a grown man cry. 

His oral interpretation of poetry and lyrics is so stiff 
that one could guess it was a comic characterization : 
" And now ladies and gentlemen, Frank Gorshin will do 
his impression of Senator Sam Erwin reciting the lyrics 
to If I H.d a H.mmer." But no, this is for real. He does 
this . 

OK, for a certain type of audience, the anecdotes of 
Zeke .nd the Snake, and The Hymn Boolc .nd Link 
Shaw's Singin' are going to be amusing. But hearing the 
good Senator's Thou,hts on Sh.Jkespe.Jre could set 
theatre back a couple of hundred years . 

Now my intent here is not to condemn, as the 
freedom of speech he mentions at one point on the 
album, should allow anyone to make a record album . 
But having heard this album once, I can't imagine 
desiring to hear it again, and with the scarci ty of vi nyl 
being what it is, I just ca n't understand why Senator Sam 
ever felt the need . 

Electric Li,ht Orchestr. - On the Third Day. United 
Artists 

The problem with ELO is that they are se tting 
themselves up as an electric orchestra, using electric 
cellos, violins, and various synthesizers, and yet th ir 
music is very stiff, choppy, and quite unlike the flu id 
form they should be capable of achieving. But in 
thinking about this more and more, it occurred to me 
that how cou ld you combine Chuck Berry and LudWig 
Van Beethoven in one piece and do them both justice? 
Well of course, the synthesis had to be a sound in its 
own. 

And this is the turf the Electric Light Orchestra has 
chosen to tred. A synthesis of sty le that maintains points 
of each style rather than create a compromise between 
the two When this i applied to their original works, 
some successful arrangements result. 

On The Third Day is the first ELO album to really hold 
its style together. The ear lier two albums were choppy 
and lacked a certain ground. With this latest release, the 
band is beginning to find itself. 

Good thoughts in arrangement show themselves in 
songs such as Oh No Not Susan. The Top-40 formu la has 
its Influence on the band, but their unique style adds a 
color to its presentation which makes a song like 
Showdown actually enjoyable listening rather than the 
simplistic pop-tune its basics reveal it to be . 

Despite this basic arrangemeot capability , I sti ll wish 
ElO would be more innovative than imitative. Their 
arrangement of In the H.II of The Mountain king simply 
screams out for creativity and embellishment, rather 
than letting its familiar theme speak for itself over and 
over again . 

So, the album hits and misses. But the hits are more 
frequent than prior ElO albums, and this marks the first 
ElO album you can play all the way through without 
getting tired . It's certainly a step in the right direction. 

Rats in the Art Go Ilery? 
There are rats in the Humanities 

Library Art Gallery, as well as some 
not-50-raggedy pieces of Raggedy 
Ann, and a stained-glass forest. 

On display through this weekend 
are Drawin,s and Paintings on 
Paper by Jennifer kotter. Jennifer 
has been an undergraduate at 
UCSD for two years . For several 
months she worked for the 
psycho logy department rai sing 
laboratory rats . Her familiarity with 
their forms has lent itself as a ready 
subject for some of her art. 

You needn't worry about being 
squeamish. Jennifer's rats won't 
ni bblf' at your heartstrings or 
threaten with overf)owering 
rodentness; they aren't really rats 
but on ly th forms of rats . The 
I'ngagf'rn«'n' I, mtcllE'ctuai ' ~dl('r-. 
"kE' of'~i~m ilrf' "rung ou t flat on 
long stflP' nf whdt <-ould be 
(omplIl('r r(;,rldOul, d~ sugge ted by 
rf'gular "alp markings along the 

border, vallut! brown fonns become 
actual specimens pinned but\erfly-
I ike by the mere addition of an 
outline. Yet honest rat ness is 
present . The character of the lines 
is as simple and unmistakable as 
the stars or bells whicfl punctuate 
painstaking rat-pattern wallpapers. 

To those who remain un-
convinced of the difficulty of 
creating non-lovable rats I would 
suggest a series of postcard-sized 
painting of Raggedy-Ann . Through 
careful control of her materials the 
artist creates a static filmstrip 
following the contours of three 
walls . Starting with what appears 
pure design , the perspective 
gradually changes until you realize 
you are seeing close-ups of ,ums 
and yarn hair. The chest comes into 
view with a heart outlining I LOVE 
YOU, but in case you yield to the 
temptation of sentimentality, you 
are shot with three frames of Pf'"-
and-ink clo"n-face caricature and 
led away, back to the c~jectivity of 

the super~loseup . 

Most beautiful' of the pieces on 
exhibit are the almost ceiling 
neight hangings. These translucent 
panels of backlit parchment glow 
color making the space between 
their rows into a rustling sanctuary. 
Indeed, some of the strips bear a 
tree-bark texture, but the colors 
and patterns vary as widely as the 
ki'nds of pigments used. Here 
Jennifer has allowed the medium to 
determine the appearance of each 
finished piece; the results range 
from deep blue-purple woodcuts of 
enchanted forests to tenuous pastel 
films where furry worms have left 
their marks . 

If you'd like a taste of something 
genuine and original, stop in and 
see this work . The Art Gallery is on 
the east side of the HL building, 
ground (plaza) level, open 12-5 
Friday and Saturday.

Fiddling About 
Saturday night, Jan. 26 the 

Campus Program Board will 
present Kenny Hall the Sweet 
Mi ll String Band in concert at 
the Revelle Cafeteri a . This band 
which plays traditional songs 
and fidd Ie tunes from the 
southern United States, is one of 
the best to have come out of the 
current revival of o ld-fashioned 
music and has played across the 
coun try during the past four 
years. 

The band is capable of 
playing a wide variety of music. 
Much of its repertoire is from 
the commercial country music 
of the 1920's and is wild, driving 
music played on fiddle, guitar, 
banjo and mandolin . However 
the band can play the more 

subdued, almost classical , Irish 
dance music on tin whistle and 
fiddle. 

Several members of the band 
are well known as some of the 
best musicians in their idiom 
Kenny Hall, a blind mandolin 
and fidd le player, has played for 
over 30 years, and is an exciting 
and very personable performer. 
Harry liedstrand has played 
fiddle since age three and has 
shown himself to be stiff 
competition in fiddler's contests 
across the country. 

Also appearing will be song 
writer and singer, Jack Temp-
chin . Th~ show begins at 8:30 
PM with $.50 admission for 
students and a dollar for non-
students .

School of Medicine and the 
general campus faculties in 
both teaching and 
research." 

The second-year class of 
two years ago also achieved 
the top score on th is same 
test. Dr. Charles E. Spooner, 
A sistant Dean of the 
Medical School attributes 
the resu lts to "one of the 
outs tanding medical school 
faculties in the United' 
States . The faculty has 
attracted th'e better

proJect. would aid the fisherman as, for instance, large schools 

The theory was soon developed that the anomalous 
temperatures noted in these surface pools in the North 
Pacific might have a strong influence over the mean-
dering course taken by the jet stream as it flows east-
ward across the middle latitudes of the Northern 
Hemisphere. And the route taken by the jet stream 
determines how much falls naturally out of the at-
mosphere and where . Witness the recent history of San 
Diego weather . 

Everyone was pretty 'mmmm, could be' about this jet 
stream theory until two years ago, when Dr. J. Namias, 
using data collected from the project directed by Dr. 
Isaacs and from historical files of oceanographic and 
meteorlogical data, predicted in the fall of 1971 the 
path of the jet stream and the weather patterns for the 
ensuing winter in the continental United States. It 
turned out that his predictions were remarkably precise. 
As a note, Dr. Namias, who was then with the National 

of fish are known to desert fishing areas when there is a 
radical change in the ocean environment. 

Second, the Navy in particular hopes to gain strategic 
and tactical benefits in planning fleet operations from 
knowledge acquired co ncerning long-term changes of 
weather, and would like to be able to improve the 
capability of its onar equipment with a greater un-
derstanding of the sea, since sound propagation is 
critica lly affected by the distribution of ocean tem-
peratures near the su rface. 

NOR PAX is a step towards a world with a finite 
number of equations describing its physical properties 
in the sense of an energy exchange between the sea and 
the atmosphere. Its foundation of data was collected 
with the aid of other countries, and this international 
COoperation is going to continue. The program expects 
to receive input from an independent Japanese effort 
and to eventually involve the work of scientists from 
many nat ion~ 

'Prof's Research Res~lts In Early Detection Of Cancer' 
Four weeks after a 38 

year-old San Diego man was 
given a thorough physical 
examination and a clean 
bill of health, this same 
man agreed to take a 
recently developed test for 
cancer at the Veteran 's 
Hospital in San Diego and 
was found to have a form of 
thyroid cancer. The cancer 
was in such an early stage 
that no apparent symptoms 
had yet developed. 

of the endocrine section of 
the Veteran's Hospital and 
associate professor of 
medicine at the University 
of California, San Diego 
School of Medicine. 

Dr . Deftos has 
established one of the few 
laboratories in the world 
that ca n provide the 
co mplex blood 
measurement test necessary 
for detecting the presence 

The test is so sensitive 
that it can detect calcitonin 
secreted in the " pre-
malignant stage"-before a 
tumor actually develops . 
This early detection is 
crucial since offspring of 
medullary thyroid car-
cinoma patients have an 

increased chance of 
developing the thyroid 
cancer 

Deftos was on the 
research team at the 
National Institute of Health 
in Bethesda, Maryland, that 
discovered the existence of 
the hormone calcitonin in 
the early 1960's. 

Associate Dean of the 
U.C San Diego School of 
Medic ine, Dr. Harold J. 
Simon evaluated the 
success as " first of all a 
tribute to the abilities and 
hard work of the students 
a'nd to the faculty wh~ 
teach them. It is also a 
credit to the people who 
original,y crea ted the 
Opportunities that have 
attracted the quality faculty 
we have in the School of 
Medicine. The investment 
was consciously made early 
and heavily here in basic 
sciences. and this ha s 
fostered a good and 
productive climate for JOint 

The School of Medicine 
last week also notified the 
first grou p of the 96 
students to be admitted this 
year from more than 4,000 
applications, that they have 
been accepted to enter the 
school next fall. Students 
accepted by the medical 
school are generally from 
the upper 10 to 15% of their 
graduating class and dre 
se lected aftet personal 
interViews, evaluations of 
their extracu rr icu lar in-
terests and activities , and 
letters of recommendation . 
Medical school applicants 
also take a four -pa rt 
Medical College Admission 
Test and those students 
accepted by the U.c. Sa n 
Diego Sc hool of Medicine 
generally rank in the upper 
th ird on all sec tions.
