Old Seed lbow. 
NewWrlnld .. 
LOS ANGELES - A 1,200-
year-old lotus seed recovered 
from a Manchurian. lake bed in 
China may help scientists 
discover the secrets of the 
aging process. UCLA re-
searchers were able to bring 
the seed to germination, 
making it the oldest known 
seed to have successfully 
withstood the test of time 
without losing its potency. The 
age of the seed suggests that 
the lotus plant may be able to 
help unlock the secrets of 
"successful aging" in plants 
and humans.

Teenager Falls 
To His Death 
From Cliffs 
North of 510 
ACCIDENT: 18-year-old Chula 
Vista boy went to local cliffs with 
friends to enjoy view 
By Anand Patel 
Staff Writer 

An 18-year-old high school student from Chula 
Vista tumbled 200 feet to his death early Saturday 
morning while walking with friends along the Torrey 
Pines cliffs. 

The victim, Michael M. Gullard, was walking 
along the cliffs - approximately one-quarter mile 
north of the Scripps I nstitution of Oceanography-
accompanied by three friends, UCSD Police Ser-
geant Bob Jones said. The group apparently scaled 
a fence and strayed into an area' posted as "off-
limits" due to the dangers posed by the cliffs in that 
area. 

Jones said the group then hiked along the cliffs 
before preparing to leave the area at approximately 
1 a.m. At that point, Jones said, Gullard squatted 
along the edge of the cliff. As he rose from his 
crouched position, Gullard lost his footing and fell 
200 feel 10 the beach below. Police, paramedics and 
the fire department responded at 1 :05 a.m., after one 
of the witnesses reported the accident to the UCSD 

, Police. 
The San Diego Police receive~ an anonymous 911 

call from a pay phone at the Mobil gas station at the 
corner of Villa La Jolla and La Jolla Village Dr. at 
roughly the same time. 

Paramedics confirmed Gulliud's death at 1 :30 
a.m. 

Jones said the Police have ruled out the possibility 
that the fall was a suicide. 

"The incident was just a tragic accident," he said. 
The San Diego Coroner's office performed an 

autopsy Saturday, but has not yet filed an official 
report concerning the incident. 

In addition, a toxicological report will be com-
pleted within the next few weeks to determine whether 
Gullard was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at 
the time of the accident. 

The Sun., Nov. 12, issue of the San Diego Union-
Tribune stated that Gullard lived in Chula Vista w.i.lJl 
his mother, Gloria Gullard, and attended Sweetwater 
High School. 

Jones said that many people are drawn to the 
Torrey Pines cliffs because of the spectacular view.

A.S. Council Votes to Extend Che Oversight Through 1995·96 
MEETING: Council 
also debates name of 
student-run TV station 
By Eather Yoon 
Staff Writer 

Weeks of debate surrounding the 
Che Cafe's financial status ended 
last night, when A.S. 
councilmembers voted to continue 
the council's oversight of the co-
op's operations. 

The Che submitted a financial 
review Wednesday, in lieu of the 
audit mandated by the Memoran-

dum of Understanding - an agree-
ment between the administration, 
the co-ops, the A.S. and the Gradu-
ate Student Association. 

The Co-op Oversi~ht Commit-
tee recommended last month that 
the A.S. accept a financial review 
and business plan from the Che, and 
continue to oversee the Che's op-
erations. 

"[The committee] decided, upon 
seeing the review, that the Che is 
financially solvent," Co-op Over-
sight Committee chairman Sujata 
Shende told the council.

Committee Considers 
1S-Minute Interval 

ETCETERA. • • 
PROPOSAL: Detractors say extended passing time 
between classes would cause confusion 
ByV ....... V.nc. 
Guardian Reporter 

The extensive growth of the 
UCSD campus has spu rred the Aca-
demic Senate Committee on Cam-
pus and Community Environment 
(CCCE) to recommend to the Aca-
demic Senate and the UCSDadmin-

In order to allow for 15 minutes 
between classes, Monday-Wednes-
day-Friday classes would tX:gin at8 
a.m., 9:05, 10:10, etc.; while Tues-
day-Thursday classes would be re-
duced from 80 minutes to 75 min-
utes, starting on the hoor or half-
hour. 

istration that the 
time interval be-
tween classes be ill-
creased to 15 m 10-
utes next quarter. 

The CCCE first 
proposed the idea of 
an increased class 
interval in 1992, and 
submitted its formal 
plan to the faculty in 
1993 and 1994.

Faculty and the 
administration 
have raised two 
main Objections to 
the CCCE's pro-
posal : 

·Thelongerday 
required by an in-
crease in class-in-
terval time could 
interfere with the 
schedules of stu -
dents who work. 

·Thelongerday 
would require more 
students to attend 
classes after dark 
- when standard 
time is in effect -
thereby posing a 
potential security

Latin-American Studies Receives Grant

A recent faculty

that the present dis-
tribution of class-
rooms causes late 
arrival and earl y 
departure f rom

"very widespread 

ASUCSD President A.S. President 
Naomi Falk said 

the new measure would not be ben-and disturbing to students and fac-
ulty alike." 

Student reaction to the CCCE's 
proposal was mixed. 

" I think it would make things 
more confusing," said Muirsopho-
more Carrie Murray. "Professors 
and students would still getlo class 
late." 

Muir sophomore Mike Ciecek 
does not see the current 10-minute 
time interval as problematic. 

" I haven't had a problem, so far, 
getting to class," he said. "It would 
be nice to have a longer passing 
~pod, but students used to the rou-
tine would find it difficult to ad-
just. " 

Other students cited the long dis-
tances between campus classrooms 
as justification for the proposal. 

"It 's a good idea because some-
times professors let students out late, 
and some people have to go from 
Warren to Revelle," Revelle fifth-
year student Nicki Mayes said. 

eficial to students. 
"The · only two alternatives, if 

you increase the passi ng-period time 
to 15 minutes, is to cut classes from 
50 minutes to 40 minutes, which 
I'm against... or have classes start at 
8:00, 9:05 or 10: 10," Falk said. 

"I think the proposed schedule 
would be very confusing to most 
students. I think we're better off 
keeping it the way it is," she added. 

Ifthe Academic Senate approves 
the CCCE's proposal next quarter, 
the senate will in turn make its rec-
ommendation to the administration. 
The new schedule, if approved, 
would go into effect next year. 

The CCCE has said it wou Id like 
to hear-from students and TAs who 
have opinions about the proposed 
schedule change. E-mail comments 
to pthompson@ucsd.edu or send 
them via on-campus mail to Peggy 
Thompson, 0002, before the winter 
break . 

The UCSD Center for Latin-American Studies has 
received a grant of $261,250 from the Ford Founda-
tion to launch a multi-year project involving research, 
training and policy analysis on Latin America and the 
PacifIC Rim. 

The goal study will explore the relationships 
between the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, 
which researchers believe will be instrumental in 
shaping a new world order in the post-Cold War era . 

The first phase of grant-supported activities will 
focus on regional economic integration. A second 
phase of activities is likely to focus on educational 
and cultural issues, with researchers examining 
academic curricula in elementary through higher 
education. 

Over the next two years, the program will draw eight 
to 10 visiting fellows from Latin America and Asia, who 
will spend a year at UCSD. During their residency, the 
fellows will conduct collaborative research and orga-
nize international seminars on themes of common 
interest.

Pow-wow: Naomi Falk confers with KSDT members at the meeting. 

COUNCIL: 
Continued from pac. 1 

The annual deadline for the 
AS.'s renewal of co-op oversight 
was extended for t he Che, from Oct. 
30 to Nov. 15. The deadline for the 
business plan, which was not re-
ceived, is Nov. 29. 

Several A.S. councilmembers dis-
approved renewing oversight of the 
Che, which passed by a 12-8 vote. 

"The AS. council is not ready to 
make an educated decision about 
continuing any oversight of the 
Che," said Serena Thakur, AS. rep-
resentative to the University Cen-
ters Advisory Board (UCAB). 

"The Co-op Oversight Commit-
tee, by a CPA's definition of finan-
cial solvency, has not received ad-
equate information from the finan-
cial review," she said. 

AS. Administrative Represen-

tative Paul deWine drew allention 
to the 53,993 debt cited in the Che's 
financial review. 

II A financial review reflects a 
best-case scenario for a business," 
deWine said. "If this debt is the 
best-case scenario, I'd hate to see 
what an audit would report." 

However, A.S. President Naomi 
Falk, and several other 
councilmembers, supported the de-
cision of the oversight committee. 

"It's evident that the Che has 
come a very long way in pulling out 
of its debt this past year - from 
$15,000 to 53,993," Falk said. 

Falk added that the council has 
known the cafe was in debt for the 
last two years_ 

"What difference would a much 
more costly audit make?" she said. 
"If a problem with overseeing the 
CM develops, the A.S. can revote at 
a later time, instead of spending 

The UCSD Guardian 

exlelllive lime addressing it as a 
hypothetical situation now." 

Earlier in the meeting, 
councilmembers voted - after ex-
tensive debate - to name the A.S.-
sponsored television station " Stu-
dent-Run Television" (SRTV). 

Several counci Imembers insisted 
that the station's name should af-
firm its affiliation with the AS., 
while others recommended further 
discussion. 

"The name of the station, without 
some acknowledgme~ ofthe AS., is 
a missed opportunity on the AS. '5 
part for public relations, n AS. Stu-
dent Advocate Souley Diallo said. 
"The A_S. council is entitled to that 
opportunity, given all the funding we 
provide for the station's operations." 

A.S. Commissioner of Commu-
nications Farsam Shadab disagreed 
with Diallo, as well as the approved 
name. 

"The name 'SRTV' isalast-ditch 
effort on the part of the oversight 
committee," Shadab said. "The 
station's decision to go with this 
name is the practical one for them 
because it's been in use this quarter, 
but it merits much more consider-
ation than they've given it." 

However, Director of Station 
Development Alex Thiesen claimed 
the station supported the name. 

Falk, a member of the station's 
oversight committee, said, "The 
oversight committee has been work-
ing with this issue for seven months 
now. If a better name couldn't have 
been arrived at by this time, it never 
will be." 

Within council, AS. Senators 
Hogan Tom and Alex Lam an-
nounced their resignations for un-
disclosed reasons.

Shutdown Hurts 1hose Who 
Can Afford It the Least 

Eight-hundred thousand "nonessential" federal employees 
found themselves locked out of their cubicles, toll booths and 
executive washrooms Monday morning. Even the so-called 
"essential services" would be hamstrung because, while all the 
border patrol a:::;ents, servicemen and jailers would report to 
work, their support staffs would be furloughed . 

The federal government, operati~g without a budget for 
over a month, shut down Monday after last-minute efforts by 
President Clinton and Congressional leaders to reach a budget-
ary compromise failed . Republicans want to cut social pro-
grams and bring an end to what they call rampant government 
spending, while Democrats are not ready to tum their bac~ on 
Roosevelt 's New Deal and other social establishments. The 
president and Congress bicker back and forth , and neither side 
realizes that the shutdown is costing the government more than 
remaining open would. 

Congress has promised to pay everyone - including 
itself- retroactively, so the money that would have been spent 
during the shutdown will still be spent. But because every toll 
booth and snack bar from sea to shining sea will be closed, 
there will be no money coming into the national coffers to pay 
for it all. 

The end result: The closure helps no one and hurts those 
who can afford it the least - the nation's working class. If it 
lasts longer than a week, some employees could miss their 
paychecks. A late or non-existent paycheck doesn't mean 
much to a senator who makes $133,600 per year, but it does 
mean something to the tens of thousands of hapless civil 
servants who live from paycheck to paycheck, wondering if 
they ' ll have enough money to put dinner on the table. 

But the politicians don't care about the human cost. And 
they don 't care that the shutdown will ultimately cost them 
more than they could ever have saved. They just don 't care. 

Parking Services Is Telling 
Students To Take a Hike 

A UCSD student drives home after midnight- he lives in 
a Warren apartment - and parks his car in the vast emptiness 
of East Parking. He parks there because he doubts there is an 
empty space waiting just for him at the new lot by 
Canyonview. The Canyonview lot, however, is not close to 
home either. If he parked there, he'd still have to walk home. 
He knows he can catch the nightly East Parking shuttle, which 
runs from midnight to 4 a.m. and goes straight to the Warren 
housing complex. But what he might not know is that this 
shuttle service, upon which he depends, may soon be axed by 
UCSD Transportation and Parking Services (f&PS). 

According to T &PS, about seven students ride the shuttle each 
night, a decrease of 74 percent from the number of riders last 
year. This decrease, T&PS officials say, is reason enough for 
cutting the service, particularly because they have been planning 
for about a year to do so. The new Canyonview lot is suppased to 
replace the need fur the nightly East Parking shuttle. 

But for T&PS, cutting back is nothing new. Last year, it 
decreased the shuttle service which runs between the UCSD 
Medical Center in Hillcrest and the one in La 101la from twice 
per hour to once per hour. In addition, the Campus Loop 
shuttle began arriving at shuttle stops every 15 minutes, as 
opposed to the previous year's which ran every 10 minutes. 

Ax a shuttle here, ax a shuttle there. Nobody will notice, 
right? But students do notice. This service provides us not only 
with a convenient way to get to and around school, but with a 
necessary means of transportation. The remote lots, such as 
East Parking, require shuttles because they are so far away 
from the main campus. And the few lots that are on the main 
campus are always full. 

It's no wonder that both commuters and students who live 
on campus are disheartened by the lack of attention to their 
parking needs. As Warren College Student Council President 
Anne Ehrlich said of the East Parking nightly shuttle service, 
"Even if only one student uses it, it's worth it." Unfortunately, 
T&PS disregards the one student. It might as well tell him to 
take a hike -literally.

UCSD BUREAUCRACY KILLS 
STUDENT IDEN'Il'I'Y 

COMMENTARY: While Americans are quite familiar with tedious 
. paperwork and long lines, foreign students are in for a shock

Contributing Opinion Writer

cessed. To enroll in c/asses, press one. To list your

Is there anything better than TESS to introduce for-
eign students to UCSD's bureaucratic hell? Being an 
Exchange Abroad Program (EAP) student at UCSD is 
like going to bureaucracy school. Now 
in my third stay in the United Statea 
as aD exchange student, lam certainly 
aware that nothing is possible in this 
country without filling in thousands of 
things called "scantrolll" with No. 2 
pencils. However, the paperwork I 
have had to endure before, duri ng and 
after being accepted to this university 
far exceeds my other two years in the 
United States put together. 

bureaucratic requirements that the real problems be-
gin. One has the illusion that life will then become 
easier, but it's just that - an illusion. To join any kind 
of student extracurricular activity, one needs to get 
trained, get membership cards, pay more fees, log into 
computer accounts and, of course, get more stickers 
on the ID card. 

Getting a job with a student-visa status is also a 
nightmare. Foreign students can only work on cam-
pus, making the task of attaining a job much more dif-
ficult. Listening to "Mr. Telejob 's" sexy computer voice 
does not make up for finding out - after half an hour 

- that one is not eligible for the ma-
jority of the jobs listed. 

The entire process started with a 
rather simple UC application. The 
UCSD application came next, and 
since then, I've been filling in 
scantrons and writing asays about my 
goals and put experiences IS a foreign 
student. By now, I know more about 
myself than I ever wanted to know. 
Betweent the housing application, the 
housing contract, the meal plans, the 
mandatory health insurance, class en-
rollment, the student ID card, bicycle 
registration and even the parking per-
mit, I've had more than my share of 
paperwork. 

Ust.I.ngto 
"Mr. Telejob'." 

The add/change/drop period is an-
other source of annoyance. If foreign 
students decide to take advantage of 
the system and shop around for inter-
esting classes unavailable in their 
home countries, they must be prepared 
to stand in never-ending lines at the 
registrar's office, get signatures and 
seals from various professors and de-
partments, talk to Mr. Telejob's girl-
friend, TESS, and pray to get on and 
off various waiting lists. 

I know that American students also 
experience this bureaucratic night~ 
mare. I also realize that international 
students are actually better off than 
many American students because we 
often have some paperwork done for 
us at the International Center, and we 
have greater privileges when register-
ing for classes than do Americans. 

But even after tbe first chaotic 
month, the paper show continues. Get-
ting a student ID only means that the 
university gives a number to each face; 
it docs not mean that the school rec-
ognizes students' identity, IS most for-
eign students probably assumed before 
coming here. And to truly identify a

But, unfortunately, the impersonal 
bureaucracy that foreign and Ameri-
can students have to face every day 
is not limited to the UCSD campus. 
A general disregard for the individual

COMMENTARY: Despite trying to develop innovative and unique architectural wonders, 
the designers of UCSD's Master Plan have instead created an uncomfortable environment 

CAMPUS ARCHITECTURE GONE AsTRAY 
By BrIce RItter 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

When it rained last week, I recog-
nized a striking resemblance between 
the architeclure at UCSD and the bar-
ren mOdernity in the movie Blade 
Runner. Everything malched, from 
Ihe nagging drizzle and sense of aban-
donment to Ihe stripped-down forti-
fications. 

In 1958, the UC Board of Regents 
established the parameters of what 
would become the campus character, 
community and design al UCSD -
aptly tilling it the "Masler Plan." It 
dictated the extensive guidelines by 
which UCSD would evolve into Ihe 
21st century. 

In accordance with Ihis plan, Ihe 
designers of UCSD began the search 
for what they called "a noble place." 
They soughl to creale Ihis noble at-
mosphere through innovalive archi-
tecture, envisioning a major walkway 
comparable to Paris ' Champs 
Elysees, a monumental plaza rivaling 
Venice's Piazza San Marco and a li-
brary as compelli ng as a Mayan pyra-
mid. 

Obscured by ambition and the 
impossibility of constructing modem 
versions of these man-made wonders, 
architects have strained to ac~ieve the 
notoriety associated with innovative 
designs. Consequently, the artistic fea-
tures and overall style of buildings at 

UCSD reflect a mishmash of archi-
tectural forms, which do anything but 
inspire a "noble" almosphere. In fact, 
we have a new, concrete foolpath, a 
congested shopping mall and food 
court, as well as our own space sta-
tion. 

Obsessed with grandiose goals, 
UCSD architects failed to inject a 
sense of personable ambiance into the 
colossal arrangement of buildings, 
walks and green landscapes. As a re-
sult, sedate cement structures - in 
different cubicalforms and layouts-
weigh down campus vitality. The ur-
ban designers were well aware of how 
archilecture and layout establish the 
atmosphere of a university. However, 
their idealistic intentions fail to "fos-
ter an individuality and identity of 
area throughout the community," as 
the Master Plan hoped. On the con-
trary, they slap the environment with 
a sense of alienation and discomfort, 
as uninviting in appearance as the 
AP&M building - which looks like 
something out of Gotham City. 

The Master Plan describes the ar-
chitectural plans for UCSD in terms 
of maximization, utilization, function 
and purpose, in cona:rt with a college 
atmosphere. This emphasis on capac-
ity and practicality transcends a ma-
jority of the designs. Despite three 
decades of development at UCSD, the 
overall appearance of new facilities 

From the massive 
RIMAe to the 
bomb-shelter 
Undergraduate 
Ubrary, a 
repetitive style 
plows through the 
campus 
atmosphere. 
still resembles that of the old. From 
the massive RIMAC to the bomb-
shelter Undergraduate Library, a re-
petitive style plows through the cam-
pus atmosphere, precluding variation 
or any sense of progress. 

A single institutional motif with 
minor alterations cinches the knot 
bound around UCSD, smothering 

campus character. Things have ex-
panded so quickly that quantitative 
magnificence crushes qualitative as-
pects. The quaint communily "in 
which residents identify themselves 
with the communily and Ihe univer-
sity simultaneously" has given way 
to the cold, modem look, alienating 
the "sense of place" designated by the 
plan. 

The various neighborhoods at 
UCSD reflect this void. Alone end 
of the campus, Muir's gray towers 
dominate the skyline. At the 01 her end, 
a cluster of cinder blocks known as 
"Warren" has earned such nicknames 
as "Little Beruit" and "The Prison." 
At Revelle, meanwhile, the lale-l960s 
"cement trend" pushed Ihe dorms 
against a gigantic, deflowered drill 
quad. If these were the only architec-
tural blunders, I wouldn't complain. 
But since the installation of the new 
Library Walk, I see that the "institu-
tion" look of the modern-architectu re 
era sti ll thrives. 

The Library Walk looks more like 
a runway for a May Day military pa-
rade, rolling wilh tanks and artillery 
-or maybe a landing strip for a space 
shuttle. It defies any sense of imagi-
nation, coordinating various shades of 
gray brick in strict geometrical suc-
cession. And the static row of boxes 
along the walk only compounds the 
already monotonous and regimented 

design. This desolate, industrial mo-
tif detracts from campus character. 
What happened to colors? Why not 
the yellow brick road? Undeniably, 
the walk unifies an evolving cenlral 
campus, but at what cost must we sac-

rific~ aesthetic value for practical 
function? 

We need a diversion from this tyr-
anny of gray. We need buildings with 
contours and a sense of spontaneity 
-something lively and outstanding. 
The grayness drowns the campus en-
vironment and the personable aura 
Ihat should surround il. 

Even Ihe Stuart Collection suffers 
from a lack of purpose and function. 
As called for in the Master Plan, art 
should adorn the landscape of UCSD. 
But look what the need for "monu-
mental art" and "landscapes embel-
lished by art" has resulted in: a monu-
mental fly-net cutting through the 
eucalyptus grove and Milton 's pel 
snake - a symbol of Puritan para-
noia which writhes to the side of Ihe 
Central Library. The ideas are there, 
but the medium of design denies their 
noble efforts. 

The hood ornament of UCSD 
is undoubtedly the Central li-
brary. In spite of its ingenious de-
sign, it does not fascinate me as 
an example of architectural maj-
esty. Its "five-level spheroid

university can change from a stu-
dent-oriented institution into a 
bureaucratic hell . The student 
population at UAB used to be very 
proud to be Bellaterra students 
(the name of the town where the 
university is located), and all stu-
dents felt they were part of the 
community. The student organiza-
tions were double the size of those 
at the other four universities in 
Barcelona, and our campus spirit 
could not have been better. 

However, in the past five years, 
the administration at UAB has 
raised the tuition fees and, at the 
same time, it seems to have com-
pletely forgotten about its under-

now the only thing that matters -
yet, nobody gives a damn about the 
prospective future researchers 
within the university. The under-
graduate students feel this lack of 
concern through the growing im-
personal treatment they receive 
from the administration and, as a 
result, their motivation and willing-
ness to contribute to university life 
has decreased. 

UCSD seems to be following the 
same pattern. I am aware that 
UCSD's graduate program has an 
outstanding reputation throughout · 
the country. I understand that the uni-
versity has the obligation not only to 
maintain, but also to increase such 
prestige. Nevertheless, the adminis-

No.2 pencils. A good university, 
like UCSD, should expand -
rather than limit - its students' 
thinking abilities. This way, it can 
help reshape today's overly 
mechanized society by increasing 
the number of individuals skill'!d 
in critical thinking. 

Therefore, to improve both the 
graduate as well as the under-
graduate quality of education, 
UCSD should make its personnel 
and facilities available to both of 
these student communities - and 
it should treat all students with the 
same respect. 

After all, the undergraduates 
are only asking to be treated like 
humans with brains, instead of 
machines with intelligent fingers 
to operate touch-tone phones.

Americas building, across from

The Master Plan called for ar-
chitecture which would inspire a 
"feeling, character and features 
that create community identity" at 
UCSD. But the lackluster walk-
ways, pre-formed cement struc-
tures and the humdrum of cubical 
sobriety inspire nothing more than 
communal sedation.

E·MAIL: The 
university can read 
student messages 
Continued from pall. 1 

According to UC Berkeley As-
sociate Vice Chancellor Jack 
McCredie, director of Information 
Systems & Technology, the pro-
posal simply extends current gen-
eral access and usage policies to e-
mail. 

"II seems [UCOP) did a reason-
able job of applying all the policies 
they could find that now exist about 
university property, ft he said. 

The UCOP document, released 
Aug. 21, provides a four-part defi-
nition of e-mail. It also provides 
several reasons ~ hy e-mail is not as 
secure as other means of communi-
cation, such as paper records and 
telephones. 

UCSD Assistant Vice Chancel-
lor Roger Talamantez, director of 
Administrative Computing and 
Telecommunication, said the devel-
opment of an universitywide e-mail 
policy was necessary. 

"We need to be on the record 
about electronic mail and its usage," 
he said. "There are liability issues if 
we do not do that, and we need to

take a stand on it." 
UCOP Vice President for Busi-

nessandFinanceV. Wayne Kennedy 
solicitedoomments on the draft from 
UC President Atkinson, UCOP vice 
presidents, chancellors, and the chair 
of the Academic Council. 
PrIvacy luu .. 

Several reviewers said they felt 
the stand was taken too quickly, and 
that several important issues remain 
unresolved - including the contra-
dictory nature of the guidelines on 
e-maH privacy. 

"E-mail is subject to the same 
laws, policies and practices that ap-
ply to the disclosure and protection 
of other means of communication," 
the draft states. 

However, italso states, "The uni-
versity has the right to access and 
disclose the contents of a user's e-
mail messages ... for legitimate uni-
versity operational purposes." 

"There's a question of interpre-
tation of just what [the meaning of 
the university 's right to access e-
mail for legitimate university pur-
poses) means," UCSD Academic 
Senate Chair John Wheeler said. 
"With most computers these days 
having some sort of superuser who 
can access anything, it's more a 
question of good faith that they

don't." 
UCSD Graduate Student Asso-

ciation President Steve Dubb ex-
pressed Concern that the guidelines 
give the university ~xpress permis-
sion to read users' e-mail. 

"It's appropriate to have 
systemwide guidelines to protect 
privacy, but what this does is the 
exact opposite," Dubb said. "It's a 
systemwide license to monitor 
people's communications. 

"It gives the university the right 
to police content, and I find that a 

rather frightening restriction on our 
freedom of speech," Dubb added. 

UCSD Vice Chancellor of Busi-
ness Affairs Steve Relyea replied 
that the draft "does not provide ad-
equate assurance of the rights of the 
individual to privacy, such as are 
Contained in the computer policy 
statements of other universities." 

Relyea, a member of the com-
mittee which drafted the guidelines, 
noted that many universities' com-
puterP9licies respectthe user's right 
to privacy, but "they do not guaran-

tee the security or confidentiality of 
a user's information." 

" It needs to be very clear to read-
ers that e-mail is not private," Relyea 
added. 
Protection By the Law 

However, UCS D Academic 
Computing Services Director Tony 
Wood said that student e-mail is 
protected from random disclosure 
under the 1974 Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act. 

The act denies federal fu!\ding to 
"any institution of higher learning ... 
which has a policy of permitting the 
release of personally identifiable 
records or files of students without 
written consent of their parents [or 
the individual, if over the age of 18) 
to any individual, agency, or orga-
nization .... " 

"Someone who gained access 
and disclosed private information to 
the world would be in a heap of 
trouble," Wood said. 

The University of California Stu-
dent Association resolved at its Nov. 
11-12 meeting that the same pri-
vacy rights that apply to campus and 
U.S. mail should apply to e-maH. 

The resolution, authored by UCSD 
GSA Vice President External Vicky 
Mayer,called forseveral amendments 
to be added to the proposed guidelines 
- including limiting the unive~ity 's 
disclosure of use~ ' e-mail messages 
to the extent necessary for technical 
reasons and allowing the unive~ity to 
investigate individual users only with 
just cause. 

"How would you feel if campus 
mail was being screened?" Dubb 
said. "Are they going to say campus 
mail can only be sent for legitimate 

unive~ity purposes, and then open 
and inspect the mail to make sure 
that 's the case?" 
Reuonabl. Guldelln .. 

Another major concern among 
reviewers was the vagueness of sev-
eral key parts of the guidelines. 

"[The administration is) com-
pletely unfair in expecting us to un-
derstandwhatourresponsibilitiesare," 
Muir senior Stuart Moskovics said. 
"Tryingtoimposethesekindsofvague 
and useless guidelines on students 
will disrupt the academic community 
as a whole." 

Wood disagreed, however. 
"An assumption is made that the 

reader is a reasonable pe~on and 
will act according to the spirit ofthe 
guidelines," he said. 

The guidelines were written 
vaguely to allow the individual cam-
puses flexibility in implementation, 
UCOPDirectorofInformation Sys-
tems and Computing Jim Dolgonas 
said. 

"I personally feel [the vague-
ness) strengthens the guidelines," 
he added. 

Reviewers were also concerned 
with the guidelines' access clause. 

According to the document, two 
principles govern access to univer-
sity e-mait: "compliance with ap-
propriate use of university rOKJurces 
and facilities policies, and provid-
ing services only to university per-
sons or affiliates." 

The proposal states that faculty, 
staff, students and affiliates of the 
university are· allowed access to 
university e-mail facilities "for the 
purpose of university activities," and 
that non-affiliates "and those with 
an affiliation but whose use is for 
non-university purposes" are to be 
denied that access. 

The draft cites "employee union 
representatives" as an example of af-
filiates with non-univellJity business. 

Dolgonas said the access provi-
sion of the document was being 
overinterpreted.

Jones added that the view can be 
enjoyed from safer areas without 

approachi~ the edge of the cliffs, 
however. 

The Torrey Pines cliffs, which 
extend for several miles, do not Have 
any protective railings along most 
off-limits areas. Jones said the in-

ers: the university, the city of San

state.

is responsible for rescues from its 

E·MAIL: Critics 
claim the university 
is going too far 
Continued from page 8 

"I think the wording was intended 
to say that an individual that is not a 
university employee ... shouldn 't 
come in and use a university com-
puter for union or non-union busi-
ness," he said. 

McCredie also dismissed con-
cerns that the clause would be used 
as an excuse to censor union mem-
bers' e-mail. 

"It says unions can't use [e-mail) 
to organize events, in the same way 
you can't use university Xerox ma-
chines for non-university business," 
he said. 

Talamantez added that even if 
the university were to bar union 
members from using university~­
mail faci Iities, the policy wou Id have 
little effect. 

"I think that statement is there to 
say that the university 'S electronic 
mail capability is supposed to be for 
university use only, not for other 
organizations, or other functions 
outside the university," he said. "The 
realities are that I don 't think we 
will be enforcing that kind of issue." 
UnIon-Bustln&? 

However, Dubb doubted the pro-
vision would remain unenforced. 

"If it won't be enforced, then 
why put it in the policy," he said. 
"Besides, how are you supposed to 
determine what is a legitimate uni-
versity purpose and what is not?" 

Citing the passage as "singling 
out union activity as an example of 
improper use of campus e-mail," 
the UCSA's resolution also recom-
mends that the clause be stricken 
from the guidelines. 

InitiaJ comments on the proposal 
are beginning to come in, UCOP Ex-
ecutive Assistant Mary Stephenssaid. 

"This is the very first draft, and it 
is trying to raise the issues that we 
think need to be dealt with," she 
said. "We 're trying to get a sense of 
the interests of different constituen-
cies. This is not carved in stone by 
any stretch of the imagination." 

McCredie added that the pro-
posal needs a great deal of work. 

"They didn ' t do any of the kind 
of real understanding of the inher-
ent differences of e-mail," he said. 
"I would call [the draft) relatively 
bland, and not breaking any ground." 

It will be a long lime before the 
guidelines are finalized, Stephens 
added. 

"[The finality) will depend on 
the comments we get in this first 
round of the draft," she said. "If 
there are any significant issues, we 
have to go back to the dtfwing 
board .. . and find something that is 
acceptable to all parties." 

section of the cliffs, but Jones said 
the jurisdictions occasionally over-
lap. In these cases, the owners share 
responsibilities for rescues. 

According to San Diego life-
guard Services, the last fatality in-
volving the cliffs occurred last 
March at 1325 Coast Blvd. In that 
incident, 19-year-old Scott Stone 
jumped from the cliff and drowned 
in the water below. 

Lifeguard Lieutenant Charlie 
Wright - who is responsible for 
the area from Oeean Beach to 
Black 's Beach-estimated that in 
his section alone there are two to 
three fatal falls from the cliffs ev-
ery year.

LAST YEAR, PENN & TELLER'S PERFOR-mances at the La JQlla Playhouse sold out immediately. This year, the Playhouse has booked the co-
medic magicians for nearly two weeks (Nov. 
28-Dec. to) in order to accommodate the de-
mand. The current production, which marks 
their 20th anniversary together, includes some

of the skits that will appear in a show slated to 
open on Broadway in th.e fall of next year. 
During separate phone interviews, Penn & 
Teller spoke about their interest in magic and 
their unique partnelShip. 
GcwcIM: What .. the PIa)houM

Teller: The material we do in our live show 
is extremely difficult stuff. It's a lot harder 

than a play or a musical. We don't 
have a large cast. We basically 

have to do it all, which means 
doing the writing, per-
forming and acting. Italso 
means doing the special 
effects at the same time 
- albeit we have a great

special-effects guy in charge of "covert activi-
ties." When we prepare material, it takes yealS 
to get something into the show. We're coming 
with a good bit of material that hasn ' t been seen 
in La Jolla before. We will have the giant card 
trick and a bullet catch, which are new thing;. 
Some of the stuff in our repertoire I've done 
four or five thousand times, which means I 
have a fair chance to get it right. It's like when 
you first learn a piece on the piano, you're 
always worried about missing a note and get-
ting your hand in the right position. It's not 
until you've performed the piece a whole lot 
that you can really worry about the music. Our 
situation is similar. 

Penn: Because we work on new bits three at

We have three new bits, but we also 
put stuff in that's 15 years old Be-
cause it's 15 years old, no one has 
seen il, so it looks like it's new. Our 
stuff dotsn't reflect current events, 
so you can 'Uell how old it is. We will 
do the closing we did from our first 
appearance on Broadway. 
Do you consider ycu wortl 
__ 1 

Penn: There can't be danger. The 
reasons are moral, artistic and politi-
cal. Morally, people should not be 
hurt doing an and that includes our 
crew. No one has ever been hurt 
working with us. That's really im-
portant to us. Nothing in show busi-
ness is worth dying over. The artistic 
aspect is that if oneof our friends said 
that 10 years ago one of us had been 
hurt, then when you come to the 
show, you will think, "Oh fuck, what 
if .. . " Then our show is no longer in 
the realm of art and becomes a sport 
or stunt. Politically, our government 
is trying to shirk its responsibility for 
its constituents, from itself to artists. 
They are trying to say that the fantasy 
of violence and real violence have 
something in common, and they 
don't. Playing dead is a way to say 
"Cuck you" to death. Night of the 
Living Dead isa celebrationoflife.lf 
you remove all violence from televi-
sion, you'll still have the gangs in 
LA. 

Teller: Think about the material 

you see us do. About 50 percent of it 
is potentially life-thrWening. It's 
very, very importanl that the trick 
dotsn'l go wrong so that we still have 
both eyes, all 10 fingers and the abil-
ily to walk. The kinds of things thaI 
go wrong tend to be so small they 
don't make interesting stories. Have 
I ever been eaten by a tiger? No. Have 
I ever fallen into a trap or drowned? 
No. We are incredibly prudent. We 
work our way toward a dangerous 
stunt by taking baby steps. We are 
obsessed with safety. Houdini, who 
had a reputation for being a dare-
devil, was incredibly careful. The 
only injury I know he sustained was 
a strained ankle. 
WhIII do,.. Wnk ......

wortl? 

Penn: We perform in a rarefied 
atmosphere for an elite group of 
people who don't want magic that 
makes them put aside their thinking, 
but rather magic that plays into their 
thinking. There's an implied insult in 
every magic show . If you want to talk 
about your magicians like Siegfried 
and Roy, we are not playing in that 
league. nor do we want to. We are not 
gunning for Madonna. What wewant 
to say appeals to plenty of people-
enough to sell out theaters all over the 
country - but not to everybody. 

Teller: I can make some guesses. 
I don't really know. At the very bot-
tom of it all, we really like the audi-
ence. I know a 101 of performers who 
want to be protected from their audi-
ence. People also know we are ditfer-
ent from each other, and yet we are 
loyal partners. All comedy used to be 
done in the form of a team. There 
wasn't really a stand-up performer. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Now, when you think of comedy, 
you think of an aanctive, middle-
• penon talking about his failed 
relationships. I think people are Fe-
freshcd to see two people who can 
work together. People also like sur-
prise endings, and we are into that.

Penn: Probably the Slme way you 
did. When I was 12 years old, I read 
a biography of Houdini. I thought 
there was something wonderful and 
interesting about using deception to 
do good and create art. Same as you, 
I saw some greasy piece of shit in a 
tux, pushing wornen around with Fe-
ally bad music. I said, "fuck this," 
and quit at 13. I started getting inter-
ested in music. It's what everyone 
does. Once I got to be 18,1 became a 
tremendous juggler. I don't know 
why that happened. I guess it's some 
weird glitch in everyone's life, when 
lhey realize they won't get laid and 
can't masturbate all the time, so you 
decide to leam a skill. I met Teller 
when I was in high school .. He said 
magic was an intellectual art form, 
which is kind of like saying Henry 
Kissinger is the sexiest man alive. He 
told me magic is the literal, visual 
perception of irony. It was pretty 
much a complete epiphany. 

Teller: When I was five, I sent 
away for a Howdy Doody magic set. 
It's as simple as that. I was embar· 
rassed about thaI, so when I was in 
junior high, I went into theater. One 
of my high ~hool teachers, who was 
my drama coach and introduced me 
to classical theater, was also a magi-
ciano We began to talk about how 
magic fit into the big picture in the-
ater. We came to the conclusion that

Jim Carrey Heeds 
Comedy's Call 

. Star's antics carry the sequel Ace 
Ventura: When Nature Calls 

By Pete, Ch_DI 
Staff Writer 

The costume designers of Jim Carrey's latest 
movie, Ace VellllU'a: When Nature 
Calls, must have scoured the world 
for the most obnoxious, tlamboyant 
clothing ever woven by mankind. It is 
apparent Ihat th is quest was a smash-
ingsuccess-from the awful Hawai-
ian shirts to the alarming, multi-col-
ored striped pants, Carrey's wardrobe 
perfectly compliments the manic char-
acter he plays both on and off the 
screen. 

Costumes aside, a full appreciation of When 
Nature CaUsdemands a knowledge of the many 
movies it spoofs. The film begins with a scene 
straight from ClijJ1umger, with Ace as the moun-
taineer rescuer of a stranded raccoon. Hisfailure 
to save the life of the animal plunges him into 
deep depression, driving him into a monastery. 
Called away from his simple life by the lure of 
another adventure, Ace sets out to find the 
sacred albino bat Shikaka in Africa. 

Now a priesl, Ace journeys through Africa, 
entering its jungles and interacting with the 
natives. As Ace, Carrey fulfills his quotient of 
slapstick humor, stomping on sacred grounds 
and seducing the virgin daughter of the chief. 
His investigations lead him on a trail involving 
mechanized rhinos, revolting interrogations, a 

fire walk, a battle with an alligator, an organ-
transplant contest with a tnbe's witch doctor and 
native meals served on platters made of bat 

guano. As Ace follows the trail of 
clues, the fates of the friendly Watchati 
tribe and the rival Wachootoo tribe 
hang in the balance. 

Carrey, whose stratospheric ascen-
sion to fame started with his role as the 
kinetic and suicidal "Fire Marshall 
Bill" on "In Living Color," enjoys a 
status rare even among big-name ac-
tors in Hollywood - movies are tai-

lor-made spec;ifically to his brand of zany hu-
mor. 

Throughout the movie, one is forced to pon-
der two questions: Without an entourage of 
lackeys following him ready to sacrifice bottles 
of Aqua Net, how does he maintain that alarm-
ing hair? And, what would Jim Carrey be like if 
we could just get him to take some Prozae? 

But the pressing question is whether this 
sequel is as good as the original. The answer: not 
entirely. Hilarious sequences which have noth-
ing to do with the story are injected inexplicably 
throughout the movie. But while not as tidy and 
funny as the original, Carrey's goofy, physical 
humor carries the film. 'Those seeking coherent 
plots and character development are encour-
aged to keep looking, but fans of Carrey will not 
be disappointed.

Smashing Pumpkins 
Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness 

The two-disc set, Mellon Collie 
andthelnfinUtSadness, sounds like 
the end of an era for the Smashing 
Pumpkins. Although the 
bulk of the album's best 
songs could have easily 
fit onto one, Ionser n:rord, 
the two-disc format allows 
the Pumpkins to explore 
new sounds and styles-
as well as highlight its 
guitar-driven rock. 

There is no doubt that 
lead guitarist and chief songwriter 
Billy Corpn is a gifted musician, 

. but there are moments when he fails 
to stretch his talents, serving up pre-
dictable rodt that detnIds from the 
28-song compilation. "Jellybelly," 
"Here is No Why" and "Tales of a 
Scorched Earth" all sound like re-
tread material from the band's two 
previous recordinp. 

Aside from a few clich6d IrIcts, 
Mellae CoI& IliJI provides fwd-
driving rock when the band puis its 

soul into it. Songs such as "Fuck 
You (an ode to no one), ""Zero" and 
"Where Boys fear to Tread" pro-

vide the compilation with 
the white-water-rapids 
sound that has aJways been 
the Pumpkins' signature. 

Some of Mellon 
Collie's finest moments 
occurwhen the bandsJows 
the pace down to let 
Corgan's soft voice and 
acoustic: guitar go to work. 

Ballads such IS "In the Arms of 
Sleep," "Through the Eyes of Ruby" 
and" By SIarligbt" areall gorgeously 
crafted songs that might hint at 
Corgan '5 future direccion. 

The best put of the double al-
bum is that it gives the band leeway 
to explore previously uncharted 
waters, from the dance mixes of 
"1979"ud-8eauCifuJ"totheCoun-
by Westan Itomp of -Uly (My

Trouble in Denmark 
Danish film director reveals his surreal vision in 

his epic-length film, The Kingdom 
By EIpI. P ... dlno 
Guardian Reporter 

Part Pollergeisl, "ER" and "Twin 
Peaks," 1M Kingdom is a 
surreal tour de force from 
Danish director Lars von 
1lier. The 271-minute-Iong 
film is a fascinating epic 
satire, which comments on 
the unique mixture of fear 
and hope, surrounding the 
political and spiritual issues 
in the field of medicine. 

The film revolves around the bi-
zarre happenings in a haunted Danish 
hospital called "The Kingdom" - so 
named because of its reputation for 
having the most intelligent doctors 
and for providing the best treatment in 
all of Denmark. However, further in-
vestigation by a group of Danish au-
thorities reveals the hospital's scan-
dalous, absurd and terrifying opera-

tion. 
The plot follows the story of a little 

girl (Annevig Schelde Ebbe), whose 
spirit cannot rest and must 
walk the hallsof"The King-
dom," crying out for help. 
Mrs. Drusse (Kirsten 
RoJffes), an old woman who 
considers herself a spiritu-
alist but is known to the 
hospital staff as the resident 
"malingerer" (hypochon-
driac), is the first to notice 

the cries of the little girl. Mrs. Drusse 
persuades her sOn, Buldc:r (Jens 
Okking), and eventually others, to 
pursue the girl's trail. A ghost-hunt 
ensues in effort to free the girl's soul. 

In the midst of this bizarre journey, 
the doctors become the peripheral 
characters providing comic relief and 
instilling terror. This is not a hospital 
staff to which one would feel safe

staff, Dr. Moesgaard (Holger Juul 
Hansen), starts the day off with "0p-
eration Morning Air" - a ritual in 
which all the doctors must sing out 
their names and then air their griev-
ances. 

OriginaU y conceived as a four-
part mini-series(with the potential for 
more episodes) for Danish TV, The 
Kingdom does not have the continuity 
or closure of a typical feature-length 
film. It's more like a hospital soap 
opera than a major motion picture.

than-tec:hnic:aly-perfectappearanceof 
the film does not detract from its over-
all impact. In fact, the cheap, orange 
hue of the film may even add to its 
surreal quality. 

The Kingdom opens on Nov. 22 at 
the Ken Cinema. It will play for one

18 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Mountain Biking 
The UCSO cycling team con-

tinued its string of impressive per-
formances by placing second in a 

race Sa tu rda y at Ca I 

_ 

Poly San Luis Obispo. 
UCSO had more rac-
ers earn podium spots 

(first through third) 
than any other school, but it was 
narrowly edged out of first place 
overall by Cal Poly SLO. The course 
was a smooth "fire road" that fa-
vored fitness and course familiar-
ity over bike-handling skills. 

Chad Roemer continued his 
dominance of the men 's B divi-
sion, taking first-place honors. Fritz 
Rasteger made his first podium-
topping appearance for UCSO, as 
he bested the field in men 's C. 

In what appears to be a trend for 
this season, the women 's B field 
was again swept by UCSO. Katrina 
Berger placed first, followed by 
Anne Duggan and Tina Sahba. 

Rugby 
Going up against two tough op-

ponents in one day is a difficult 
task. The UCSO rugby team, how-

ever, proved worthy of 
the challenge last Sat-

urday at Warren 
West Field, as it 
split its two game 

set - losing to San Diego State,7-
0, and trouncing rival USO, 24-5. 

The initial contest versus State 
. began as a defensive 
struggle. The La 
Jolla team jumped 
out to a quick 6-0 
lead on two penalty 
kicks. Devon Shea 
converted both at-
tempts - although 
he went out later 
with a sprained 
ankle, which will 
keep him out for 
about a month. 

as Shea and his teammates were not 
able to convert on some late scor-
ing chances. 

Playing with a vengeance, 
UCSO came out angry and deter-
mined in the second game of the 
day, overpowering USO, 24-5. 

The offensive load was carried 
by Chay Chang, Mark Bazzett and 
captain Troy Meyer - who scored 
five points apiece. Rookie kicker 

Equestrian 
The UCSO equestrian team con-

tinued to ride high this year as it 
grabbed second place in a two-day 

competition held in 
L.A. last week-

end. Earlierthis 
season, UCSO 
riders per-

formed well in two shows 
- one at Fresno State and the other 
a third-place finish at Stanford. 

In the strong showing at Palo 
Alto, UCSO's Katrina Thomas per-
formed well, gaining the esteemed 
title of high-point English rider. 

Last Saturday, UCSOwasagain 
led by Thomas, who claimed the 
open high-point rider award. 
Adrienne Laksfloss also contrib-
uted, as she finished second in the 
intermediate jumping class and 
third on the flat course. Sunny Pyne 
and Julie Wolf also recorded high 
finishes in their jumping classes. 

On S~nday, a collective effort 
placed UCSO on top, once again. 
Shannon Gaffaney won her inter-
mediate jumping class, while Pyne 
took the novice-class title. 

In the top men's bracket, Tim 
Knudsen and Erik Stauber placed 
second and third respectively -
despite enduring a crossing stream 
that (orced riders to battle through 
a few feet of water. 

The second half 
began as the previ-
ous half ended with 
both teams strug-
gling to score. 
UCSO committed GoInc down: UCSO's Mark Bazzett passes 

the ball off to a teammate against USD. 
"This competition boosted our 

confidence," Pyne said. "We have a 
strong team and lots of potential." "It felt like I was riding into a 

lake," Stauber said. "You go from 
30 mph to zero in an instant." 

UCSO kept pace with the other 
teams vying for a regional champi-
onship by out-riding squads from 
UCLA, Berkeley and SOSU. 

-Mlk.Stan •• 

numerous penalties 
and mistakes, but still managed to 
stay ahead as the half progressed. 
The mistakes caught up with the 
home tearn, however, as the San 
Diego State squad stunned UCSO 
with a late drive. 

With a convertion kick, SOSU 
edged out UCSO by a score of 7-6,

BREAK: Tritons 
will run and gun 
Continued from pal. 20 
Greg Lanthier said. "It's nice that 
we can control our own destiny." 

After intense training this past 
quarter, UCSO is looking forward 
to a strong showing in this weekend's 
openers. The Tritons will travel to 
Redlands on Friday before coming 
home for Saturday nighl's game 
against the Tigers at RIMAC Arena. 

Although UCSO's running style 
of offense is not necessarily made 
for a big man, junior center Mall 
Aune (6 '7", 240 Ibs.), should carry 
the brunt of the scoring load. 

"There are opportunities [for big 
men) to score, as long as you hustle 
up and down the court," Aune said. 

The young and talented Triton 
squad promises to entertain, boast-
ing five legitimate long-range bomb-
ers. Moreover, the lineup features 
four returning starters, co-captain 
Malt Minehan, Aune, sophomore 
co-captain lason Jones and sopho-
more shooting-guard Mark Sebek. 
Sebek and fellow sophomore lason 
Barnes will share minutes, hoisting 
three-point bombs, as well as cash-
ing in on easy lay-upson fast breaks. 

Last year, the players were get-
ting used to a new coach and a new 
system, but this year they've come 
together as a team. 

"We've acclimated to the coach-
ing staff," Aune said. "The practices 
have been better from the get-go." 

The Tritons ' strategy is designed 
to utilize the physical skills of play-
ers like Jones, who will quarterback 
the team from the point position. 

"It's a lot more fun , and a lot 
more intense," 10nessaid. "It's more 
exciting for the fans, but it 's more 
difficiiTt for the players. The reads 
are much quicker, and you almost 
have to play without thinking -
just relying on instincts." 

The best of the Triton "red shirt" 
freshmen corps will also be inte-
grated into the rotation. Mike Wall 
(6'6",210 Ibs.), a transfer from Cal 
Poly Pomona, is a solid shooter for 
a big man and will play most of his 
minutes at forward. Homegrown 
talent Adam Libby, who will share 
point -guard duties, and Mike 
Thimgan are also expected to play 
in UCSO's nine-man rotation. 

"I don ' t think we will ever step 
. on a court in a Division 111 game 
where there will be three better fresh-
men than Libby, Thigman and 
Wall," Lanthier said. 

MESSIAH=-A 
message from God 
Continued from ..... 20 
Barry Switzer: The removal of his 
cerebrum through the beam of light 
produced by the immortal Jesus. 

If you saw the game, it seemed as 
though Steve Young was talking to 
his coaches through I headset. The 
lruth. however, is Ihat Young was 
talking to the Mormon Messiah in 
the heavens-uking for more turn-
overs and touchdowns. 

The NFL's antichrist; Dallas 
owner lerry Jones, brought this on 
to himself. His team's brash com-
ments during the week only angered 
the gods.

Young NCA Club Tests Tritons 
FUTURE: UCSD went up against the future of Div. I in North County club 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

At first glance, the UCSO swim-
ming tea.m:smeet with North County 
Aquat ics (NCA) on Saturday 

seemed little more 
than a pre-season 
warm-up against a 
squad of high school 
standouts. However, 
a closer look revealed 
an NCA team com-
posed of future Divi-

..... .... _- sion I swimmers -
competitors that gave the Tritons all 
they cou Id handle. 

UCSO's men fell two points short 
against their local foes, losing 
'the hard-fought meet, 62-60. 

North County was led by 
Brian Kurza, an ass istant 
coach for the Tritons, who 
competes for NCA as he trains 
forthe next Olympics. Kurza's 
first-place finishes in the 50-
and lOO-yard freestyles were 
keys to the NCA victory. 

The Triton charge was led 
by seniors Kaley Parkinson 
and Andy Hollywood. 
Parkinson turned in second-
place finishes in the 100 
(49.18) and 200(1 :50.1 2) free 
races, failing to beat only 
Kurzain the 100. Hollywood's 
forte is the backstroke, and he 
did not disappoint, grabbing 
first by over a second in the 

Another bright spot for the men 
was sophomore Tim McAteer, who 
nabbed the top spot in the 500 free 
(4:57.95). He then proceeded to turn 
in a personal, unshaven best of 50.3 
in the first leg of the 400 free relay, 
which the Tritons went on to win by 
five-plus seconds. 

That triumph in the final race of 
the meet pulled UCSO within two 
points of a victory - although this 
proved to be too little, 100 late. The 
meet may have been decided in the 
previous race when UCSO's Greg 
Knott turned in a solid time of 
2:04.66 in the 200 individual med-
ley (1M), but was beaten out by 

seven-hundredths of a second. 
The women had a tougher time 

against NCA, falling 67-46. Buttheir 
day was not without success. The 
Tritons ' performance was high-
lighted by freshmen Kelly Burne 
and Jenny Irwin, who took second-
and third-place respectively in the 
200 free. Irwin 's name came up again 
when she swam to a solid 56.32 
mark - and second place - in the 
100 free. 

Carrie Parker, the senior co-cap-
tain of the Tritons, turned in a good 
swiminthe tOObackstroke (I:02.96) 
and took second in the 200 back-
stroke, followed closely by team-

mate Kristen Kemmer. 
Freshman Sarah Chu made 

her mark in the I 00 breast, cap-
turing first place in I : 12.16 
while fellow freshman, Linda 
Monroe, took first in the 200 
breast (2:30.94) and an im-
pressive second in the 400 
1M. 

"[Monroe] had a great 
meet," Head Coach Ooug 
Boyd said. "It 's only the sec-
ond time she swam [the 1M], 
and she dropped 15 seconds." 

Finally, UCSO's 400 free 
relay team finished with a 
quick early-season time of 
3:46.26, good enough for first 
place.

HOOPS: UCSD 
tries new schemes 
ContInued from .,.,. 20 
Coach Judy Malone said. "We're 
a lot more mobile, physical and 
athletic." 

In the past, Triton post players 
have attacked the basket from their 
position inside the paint. This year, 
however, the Triton inside players 
are smaller. They will instead be 
counted upon to use their greater 
mobility to drive to the hoop, as 
well as hit shots from the outside. 

Unfortunately, the Triton pe-
rimeter offense has already suf-
fered a major setback. Sophomore 
standout Janessa Bayda, who led 
the Tritons with 24 points in last 
year's playoff game, injured her 
knee during a scrimmage against 
Mesa College on Nov. 3, ending 
her season. 

Although losing her "money in 
the bank" outside shooter was d is-
appointing, coach Malone main-
tains thai the team has a lot of fire-
power from outside; including ac-
curate three-point shooters Marcia 
Jeffries, Cindy Yamasaki, Amy 
McClure and Tristen Tiesdale. 

Another of the Tritons ' new 
strategies will be to increase the 
pace of their games. UCSO will 
utilize its improved quickness to 
work the fast breaks and hope-
fully convert a few more easy 
baskets. 

, On the opposite side of the ball , 
UCSO wants to dominate oppo-
nents with full-court and pressure 
defenses. Having graduated three 
key players last season, this year's 

SPORTS 19 

team captains - Marcia leffries 
and Pam Contini - have "stepped 
up big time," according to Malone, 
giving the Tritons both leadership 
and intensity. 

The team is "getting used to 
playing together and is playing 
together well," says Jeffries, who 
credits the cooperation of the Tri-
ton squad on the coun to its friend-
ships off the court. "We have fun 
just hanging out, and it shows." 

Players and coaches alike hope 
to utilize their versatile offense, 
tight "0 " and intensity to obtain 
immediate and long-term goals. 

"We want to play the best bas-
ketball we can, " Malone said. "We're 
looking to improve everyday." 

The fact that they face seven 
other teams this season that also 
reached last year 's playoffs hasn' t 
squelched the Triton team mem-
bers' expectations or spirits. 

"We got a taste of winning last 
year and it was nice," Contini said. 

"We're expecting bigger and 
better things this year," junior guard 
Amy Frazen added. "The playoffs 
are definitely a possibility." 

The UCSO women will test 
their new abilities in their fi rst 
game on Nov. 21 at Claremont 
College. With a recent history of 
losing to Claremont, the players 
agree that the first-game jitters -
and playing on Claremont 's home 
turf - are obstacles, but they still 
look forward to starting the season 
on the right foot and steadily im-
proving from tliere. 

"Everyone tells us that we can 
go as far as we want to," sopho-
more forward Karli Jungwirth said. 
"And we believe them."

world is proven right. A day 
when the evil recoils into the 
darkness.

On Sunday, Nov. 12, Jesus,

to the 38-20 thrashing of the

the Super Bowl Champion San

The 4gers manhandled the 
'Boys from the outset of the 
contest. Within a minute and

notched a quick 14 points-

BIG DME: UCSD will host the Western 
Water Polo Association Championships this 
weekend, with a Final Four berth on the line 
By Dan Sweeney 
Staff Writer 

One month ago, the UCSD men's 
water polo team was not even enter-
taining thoughts of challenging for 

the 1995 Western 
Water Polo Associa-
tion(WWPA)cham-
pionship, which will 
be held at the 
Canyonview pool 
this weekend. At that 
point, Head Coach 
Denny Harper's 

squad - racking up a terrible 3-9 
win-loss clip - was merely seeking 
a win. 

way to the championship match 
before losing a heartbreaker to 
Air Force. The Tritons are ex-
pecting a decidely different 
outcome this year. 

"A lot of our players will 
have last year's championship 
in mind," senior Carlos De La 
Barra said. "We'll do every-
thing we can to right what was 
wrong last year." 

Indeed, this year's champi-
onship could again involve the 
Tritons and the Falcons - who 
are seeded second. 

The game was played at 
Texas Stadium, home of 
America's team. As you all 
know, this sports complex is 
known for a massive hole in its 
roof. The natives regard their 
wanna-be dome as a window 
through which God can watch 
its beloved team. Here's a 
newsflash, Cowgirls: God is a 
4ger. Yessireebob! 

Oh, how things can change. 
Now, the Tritons (12-11) are not 

only in the WWPA'Championship 
tournament, but also are the num-
ber-one seed. 

"A lot of teams play well during 
the season, but they don't build up 
[for the Championships]," senior 
All-American Mike Nalu said of his 
team's stunning turnaround. "We've 
been able to do that." 

But first, UCSD must over-
come its first-round foe, num-
ber-eight seed Chaminade of 
Hawaii, on Friday. In the two 
teams' previous showdown, the 
Tritons crushed the 
Silverswords at Canyonview, 
21-4. However, Harper and 
company are taking nothing for 
granted. 

Taklne aim: Junior Steve Hom and the rest of the Tritons are shooting 
for a WWPA title when they host the tournament this weekend. 

Postseason play is hardly for-
eign territory for UCSD. The squad 
has reached the WWPA champion-
ship game in 13 of the last 14 sea-
sons. 

Last year, the team made it all the 

"We're much more excited then 
we normall y wou Id be over the first-
round game," Harper said of the 
showd~wnagainstChaminade. "We 
did whomp them pretty good be-
fore, but that was our most intense 
performance of the season." 

Indeed, UCSD knows that 
Chaminade - normally a power-

house - cannot be taken lightly. 
"In the WWPA's, anything can 

happen," senior Steve Crass said. 
"They surprised us last year when 
they beat us in Hawaii, and it was a 
really bad loss for us." 

If the Tritons can survive Friday's 
contest, they will square off against 
the winner of the Claremont/Santa 
Clara pairing on Saturday. The win-
ner goes to the championship match 

held on Sunday. 
The victor of the WWPA tourna-

ment will be one of the four teams 
nationally which will qualify for the 
NCAA Water Polo Championships, 
held at Stanford on the weekend of 
Dec. 1-3. 

"I've been playing water polo 
for a long time," De La Barra said. 
"But [the NCAA's] are as big as it 
gets - except for the Olympics." 

From the moment Elvis 
Grbac stepped onto the field, 
someone was with him. On his 
shoulder sat the great Mormon 
John Smith. How does this all 
tie together, you ask? Be 
patient, my child, and I will 
explain. 

You see, Steve Young's 
great-great-great grandfather 
was the legendary Brigham 
Young. So when Young (the 
quarterback) became injured, 
Young (the pioneer) sent his 
prophet ancestor, Saint John 
Smith, down froR}. the heavens 
to make sure the Lord was 
with the 4gers. 

Triton Hoops Get Ready to Rumble 

Throughout the day, Smith 
and his trusty companion, 
Pocahontas, tackled Michael 
Irvin and the rest of the 'Boys. 

The injury to superstar Troy 
Aikman: A result of the steel 
plate inserted underneath the 
turf by Smith's lady love, 
Pocohantas, in the exact spot 
of the incident (Wait a minute. 
Wrong John Smith-
nevermind). . 

The array of Dallas 
turnovers: The work of John 
Smith, as he blinded the 
quarterback and put Vaseline 
on the football every time a· 
Cowboy touched it.

As the leaves fall from the trees, 
the air turns crisp and the holidays

it's time for the boys of the

All you hoops fans can 
get your first glimpse of the 
Triton men Saturday nigbt, 
when they square off against 
Occidental College. The 
running and gunning Tri-
tons plan to take advantage 
of their speed, as well as their 
three-poi nt-shooting prowess, as 
the season opens. As one local 
sports guru said, "You won't sec 
any shot-clock violations from 
UCSD this year."

the type of players tbat, when we 
shoot the ball well, we can beat

Optimism, expectation, ability 
and drive characterize UCSD's 
1995-96 women's basketball team 

and coaching staff. The Tri-
ton squad - which has 11 
returning players, nine of 
whom have played regularly 
in previous seasons - has 
maintained the enthusiasm 
and experience it gained 
during last season's trip to 
the NCAA playoffs. 

Last year's success, how-
ever, has not blurred the reality of 
this year's tough schedule. Deter-
mined to come out on top, the 
UCSD women have implemented 
a number of new offensive and 
defensive strategies to take advan-
tage of their new skills. 

"We're going to be a different 
looking team than we've been in 
the past couple of years," Head
