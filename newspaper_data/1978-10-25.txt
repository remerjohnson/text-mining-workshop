Off~c,r Says Lack .of Trust Frustrating 

UCSD police de tective Rick Sanchez 

By Steve Morus 
Rick Sanchez 'Lreely admits 

that when he was a kid growing 
up in San Diego he "had some 
difficulty handling the law. 
more than the average per-
son." But now. at the age of 32 
(and with an ironic twist that 
Freud would have loved) . Rick 
Sanchez earns his living as 

. Detective Sanchez. a career 
officer in the UCSD Campus 
Police Department. 

To a great extent because of 
his experiences on both sides of 
the law. Detective Sanchez has 
.a great deal to say about 
studenVpolice relations. 

In an interview with The 
Guardian. Sanchez discussed 
not only the facts governing 
student/police relationships. 
but also his own opinions 
regarding how the " new of-
ficers" can help facilitate 
student's trust in policemen. 

According to Sanchez. many 
. fundamental misunderstand-

ings arise because "the Uni-
versity Police face an identity 

problem. We've always been 
called security guards. basi-
cally because people have no 
idea of what our jurisdictional 
basis is. also because we don't 
do a lot of things that would be 
considered. quote. ·police· ... 

"We are sworn peace officers 
of the State of California." 
Sanchez stated. leaning for-
ward in his chair for emphasis, 
adding, "we have all the arrest 
powers (of) anyone else ." 
Reciting from memory he 
continUed. "the department is 
sanctioned under a provision of 
the Penal Code. with authori-
zation through the Health and 
Education Code." 

As for their jurisdictional 
base. Sanchez said the campus 
police have " primary juris-
diction on this campus itself. 
any property belonging to the 
University of California. and 
thereof a mile from any point. ·· 
The campus police have pri- · 
mary jurisdiction even though 
they share jurisdictional 
responsibility with the San 

Diego City Police and Sheriff's 
Department because of UCSD' s 
location in the unincorporated 
city of La Jolla. 

Serving the campus requires 
13 officers. three sergeants. one 
lieutenant. and a chief. plus 
three .student dispatchers and 
security guards at night . 
Sanchez estimated. 

"Basically." he said. " we' re 
a very small unit and we don't 
have the power to be every-
where. so the students have to 
be our eyes." 

"Students tend to not want to 
involve the police; they think 
we're going to take ·the police 
action· ... Sanchez said. " You 
know. we can talk to people 
without going through the ·the 
police action ' per say." he 
added. 

Sanchez finds the lack of 
student trust particula rly 
frustrating because of the 
special consideration campus 
police give to student futures .

By Jocelyn Larkin 
"While UCSD Student Finan-

cial Services (SFS) are far 
from perfect, when compared 
to the typical financial aid 
oCfice ... the students receive a 
better financial aid pakcage 
than in any other institution, " 
according to Fred Hessinger. 
deputy director of UCSD 
Financial Services. 

According to an annual 
report, UCSD Financial Aid 
distributed an exess of 18 
million dollars of federal, state. 
local and university funds to 
undergraduate and graduate 
students last year. In addition , 
the Student Employment Serv-
ice placed 2500 students in on-
campus jobs. 

Hessinier attributes the 
quality of SFS to "better 
funding and more fleXible 

~uidelines and timetables." 

At many institutions. stu-
dents are required to complete 
their financial aid file during 
the previous academic year. At 
UCSD. students are allowed to 
apply for aid as late as the first 
week of the quarter. This 
provision. while designed 
specifically to facilitate student 
needs. causes some confusion 
in the first two weeks of school. 
Hessinger said. It often results 
in long lines at the Financial 
Aid oCCice , a much larger 
workload for employees and 
frustration for both students 
and employees. 

There are other areas where 
problems exist. One student 
(who asked that her name be 
withheld) cited repeated ca es 
of "incredible incompetence by 
financial aid employees." The

past a deadline which resulted 
in her losing the loan . 

Hessinger commented that of 
the thousands of students who 
are served by SFS each year. 
" 75 to 90 percent never contact 
the oCCice more than once or 
twice a year for other than the 
routine procedures of con-
firming financial aid awards." 
However. "a small percentage 
slip through the computer and 
mistakes are made." he added . 

One cause of these problems 
Hessinger cited is that the 
system operates on " an an-
tiquated computer program." 
At present. information and 
checks must be processed DY

our Black population 81 ex-
pounded by one Anthony Flew, 
let us revel In tbJs opportunity 
to respond to tbe8e resplend-
ently perspicacious ' acsrip-
tions. Fintly, let us touch upon 
"positive discrimination." The 
farce iJlcluaive of the Bakke 
case ended with a diminished 
approval of affinnative action 
procrama. The Intention of said 
pro,rams is specifically to 
encoura,e employers and 
educational institutions to 
iJlcreaae their repreaentation of 
minorities and the poor. Tbia 
policy is iD respoD8e to an

familial incomes and sub-
standard pre-university ed-
ucational institutions will serve 
as a fertile foundation from 
which hundreds of thousands of 
social giants will emerge? Let's 
not exhibit such a culturally 
fatal naivete. 

. Moreover, consider the 
universal desire to increase the 
standards of our educational 
institutions. Could it be that an 
educational institution, which 
does not address the needs of a 
vast segment of the population 
it purportedly serves, is a 
blatant failure? Furthermore, 
how does one measure the 
standards of an academic 
institution?-- Let's offer two 
comparable measures. Firstly, 
one migbt utilize the admission 
roles as majorally indicative of 
institutional excellence. Sec-
ondly and perhaps less absurd, 
would be to consider the 
qualities of the education 
offered and the institutions' 
graduates. Should a schoo~

are therefore solely entitled to

If America would practice 
what it preaches and observe 
the Constitution, all of these so-
called "beneficial" minority 
programs to whlcb you seem so 
vebemently opposed would be 
totaDy unnecessary. How the 
United States is always 
boasting about equality, de-
mocracy and freedom wben 
sucb profound prejudice and 
inequality exists is beyond me. 
[f the programs for minorities 
did not prevail, bow would 
America clear its conscience of 
its injustice to minorities? 
Obviously not by allowing its 
citizens to live under tbe 
Constitution. You see, that 
would be a threat to white 
power and" supremacy." 
Perbaps if U.S. politics were 
riot so hypocritical America 
would not get slapped In the 
face by the "lo,;c" of people 
like you, Mr. Anthony Flew. 

I proclaim that America stop 
these "speclal" programs and 
"beneficial" aids and allow all 
Americans to live by this 
nation's creed: "All men (or 
should I say people) are 
created equal." 

AIIlela E. Rlllllea 

Flew's dismissal of Affirma-
tive Action programs as "clear-
ly racist" reflects a complete 
misunderstanding of both the 
nature of racism and of these 
programs. Racism is an on-
goiqsystem of institutions and 
bebavior patterns which gives 
an economic and lOCial ad-
vantage to wblte people at the 
expeue of noD-white people. 
Racism Is manifestly oppres-
sive, immoral and unjust, and 
bence it is not in tbe real 
interest of any human belq. 
"Colorblindneu" is not the 
alternative to racism 81 Flew 
would bave it but its per-
petuation - passive acqui-
escence masquerading under 
the banners of neutrality and 
fairness. 

Flew makes the common 
error of seeing Affirmative 
Action iD terms of "interest 
group" politics, but this i. to 
miss the point entirely. As 
white people, we perceive 
Affirmative Action programs 
as a step towards a society in 
wbich we would want to live, 
not (as Flew apparently does) 
as unjust sacrifices whicb are 
imposed on us in a futile

The president, speaking from

set a guideline of 7 percent in 
1979 for increases in wages and 
fringe benefits and a complex 
price guideline aimed at 

holding increases to approx-
imately 5.75 percent next year. 

Carter said that if the pro-
gram is successful this would 
translate into an inflation 'rate 
of 6 per cent to 6.5 percent in the 
next year, well below the 
current rate of about 8 percent. 
He said he would ask Congress 
to enact tax rebates for workers 
who comply with the 7 percent 
wage guide and who would 
suCCer when inflation exceeds 
that level, 

As part of his new assault on 
inflation, which the president 
said would be his adminis-

pledged: 
- To cut thc federal deficit to 

$30 billion or less next year. 
- To fill only one of every two 

new job vacancies in the

period ." 

- To "oppose any further re-

prospects that inflation will be

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
The decade that carried homo-
sexuality from whispers and 
scholarly studies to loud 
national debate reaches a 
milestone next month with the 
first statewide vote on rights of 
homosexuals. 

On Nov. 7, when Californians 
decide PropoSition 6, they will 
vote on a question stated 
against homosexuals' rights . 
The proposal would require 
school boards to fire or refuse to 
hire any teacher judged unfit 
because of public homosexu-
ality or advocacy of homo-
sexuality. 

Critics say tbe proposed law 
would clamp a tight lid on 
teacher's rights to speak out in 
support of civil rights for 
homosexuals, in or out of the 
classroom. Advocates say such 
rights are outweighed by those 
of parents. 

Latest public opinion poils 
indicate the vote will be close. 
The initiative is one of the most 
emotion-charged on the ballot.' 

Coming nearly 10 years after 
a New York City bar riot 
signaled the beginning of the 
gay rights movement. Propo-
sition 6 ' will be the first 
statewide test of public senti-
ment on a right rebuffed by 
voters in several cities recently 
- that of hombsexuals to jobs.

Third Colle,e students, 
faculty and staff have ex-
preued pleasure In an increase 
in college activities this year. A 
wide variety of events is 
planned for both Third College 
students and the rest of the 
student body. 

The Big Brother/Big Sister 
program, initiated at orienta-
tion during Welcome Week, 
continues to flourish under the 
supervision of Horacio Ortiz, a 
Third College student. Tbe 
program is geared especially 
for new Third studenta, pro-
vidine them with an upper-
class friend and a Iiason to their 

new college experience. Ap-
proximately 60 students bave 
volunteered to become a Big 
Brother or Big Sister thus far. 
The program will continue 
throughout the year and any 
Third student wishing to 
participate is welcome to join 

by contacting Ortiz in the 
Dean's office. 

This year also marks the 
birth of a Commuter Board at 
Third . As Susan Montrose, 
Third's Assistant Dean, ex-
plained, more attention must 
be given to the 75% of Third 
students wbo daily commute to 
school. Activities will be 
planned durlnJl the week to 

The Third College Program 
Board has been busy this

"Police departments have 
always made a big issue out of 
community relations," he said. 
"That's where the officer gets 
out and talks to people. I would 
say that our department has 
been into community rela-
tions a hell of a lot longer than 
most police departments. The 
University Police have always 
done this because they live in 
the community, they work with 
the community constantly, it's 
not anything scattered. You 
don't go from one district of the 
city to the next, you're in this 
University and that's where 
you work." 

The campus police make a 
sincere effort to talk to stu-
dents, Sanchez asserts . "I 
would put any of our officers up 
to any of the local jurisdic-
tions," he said. "Tbese officers 
are very concerned about 
student/police relations." 

Sanchez puts most of the 
blame for the failure of stu-
dents and police to communi-
cate on the studenta. "Most oC 
our officers n,ow are good 
enough with people that they 
can get out and talk. It'sjust the 
idea that most students some-
bow have this little thing about 
police, and they're afraid if a

, S&aff Writer 
It was open house last 

weekend at the National Ocea-
nographic aDd Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA). Tbe 
affair was bosted by tbe 
Southwest Fisheries Center on 
La Jolla Shores Drive. 

Visitors were treated to 
movies, slides, displays, in-
formation and laboratory 
tours. Exblbjts included a pool 
of live mackerel, sand dabs and 
anchovies, a display of full-
grown tuna on Ice, porpoise 
skeletona and fetu8es, as well 
as Jars of preserved marine 
animals at various stages of 
de\·eloprnent. 

"What do you do with aU this 
stuff?" was the question of the 
day phrased by one younpter. 

John Carr, deputy director of 
the Southwest Fisheries Center 
and Ita La Jolla Laboratory, 
attempted to answer that 
question as part of a com-
prehensive interview. 

The National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) was created within the 
U.S. DepartmentofConunerce 
in October, 1970. · Tbe new 
agency, the largest in Com-
merce, combined the functions 
of seyeral Federal activities in 
the environment and marine 
biological sciences and related 
technologies. 

The purpose of forming 
NOAA, said Carr, was to create 
a civil center of strength for 
expanding effective and ra-
tional use of ocean resources, 
for monitoring and predicting 
conditions in the atmosphere, 
ocean, and space and Cor 
exploring the feasibility and 
consequences of environmental 
modification. 

The three major elements of 
NOAA that participated in 
Saturday's exhibition were the 
National Marine Fisberles 
Service, Southwest Fisheries 
Center; the National Ocean 

. Survey; the National Weather 
Service, San Diego Office: 

- James W. Steiner, the 
meteorologist in charge of San 
Diego's Weather Service bead-
quarters at Lindbergb Field, 
was on hand to explain some of 
his responsibilities at the 
National Weather Service. 

" Our office provides weather 
rorecasts and warnings to San 
Diego and Imperial Counties 
and provides radio alerts in the 
event of a severe weather 
development," said Steiner. 

Weather information is also 
provided to local flood control 
dis tricts, to radio and TV 
stations , to the FAA when 
requested, to farmers who need 
frost forecasts and to local 
sport and commercial fisher-
men. 

- The National Ocean Sur-
vey (NOS) operates the high-
seas research vessels assigned 
to the Southwest Fisheries 
Center. The research vessel , 
Townsend Cromwell, is as-
signed to the Center's Honolulu 
Laboratory where it operates in 
large areas of the central and 
western Pacific. 

Another oceanographic re-
search vessel, the David Sw... 
Jordan, has worked exten-
sively in the ea.tern Pacific for 
the La Jolla Laboratory since it 
was comml .. ioned In 11164. NOS 
also prepares aeronautical 
charts, conducta precise geo-
detic and GceaDOlraphlc sur-

veys, predicts tides and cur-
rents and prepares and pub-
lishes navigational charts and 
related materials for coastal 
waters. 

- In 1871 , President Ulysses 
S. Grant recognized a national 
interest in fisheries conser-
vation by creating the U.S. Fish 
Commission. Today, the Fed-
eral fisbery effort resides with 
the National Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS) of NOAA's 
Office of Fisheries . 

"The Southwest Fisheries 
Center (SWFC) Is one of four 
regional research centers in the 
National Marine Fisheries 
Service," said Carr . "Our 
respoDlibiUties in a roughly 
,eographical area would in-
clude the tunas, wherever they 
occur, and coastal California, 
Hawaii, and our posseSSions in 
the Pacific - we bave re.ponsi-
bility for all of those in 
cooducting researcb." 

PalSage of the Fishery 
Conservation and Management 

Act ofl976, the most significant 
fisheries legislation in the 
nation 's history, presented 
NMFS with a major challenge 
and new and added responsi-
bilities. This act extended the 
U.S. fisheries conservation 
zone to 200 nautical miles oCC lhe 
U.S. coasts, which includes 
about 10 percent or the world's 
fish supply . 

"Nowadays much oC our 
research is related to the 
management of the fisheries 
within our 200 mile zone, Of said 
Carr. " For instance, when the 
Pacific Fisbery Management . 
Council develops a manage-
ment plan for a given species, 
(for example, anchovies) they 
need to know how many are 
there and available. Our 
responsibility is determining 
wbat the optimum sustainable 
yield would be, in otber words, 
how many you can catch 
without harming the popu-
lation. We establish that and

By Doq Campion 

Seiellee EdlIor' 
The Second Annual Cancer 

Symposium sponsored by the 
Scripps Memorial Hospital 
beJina today at the Islandia 
Hyatt House in San Dielo. The 
participants in the gathering 
have been brought together 
from all over the country to 
dlSCU8S the current research 
and treatment techniques used 
in fighting the spread of cancer. 

Topics covered In the three 
day·long sessions range from 
the specifics of various types of 
therapy, to more general 
concerns, such as "Cancer 
Quackery" and an acting out of 
some of the trauma faced by 

"The Physician and the Dying 
Patient." At the close of the 
morning and afternoon por· 
tions of each day's agenda, a 
question and answer exchange 
will be encouraged between the 
members of the speaking panel 
and the audience. 

Featured at the symposium 
will be Dr. Vincent T. DeVita, 
Jr., the director of the Division 
of Cancer Treatment at the 
National Cancer Institute in 
Bethesda, Maryland, and Dr. 
George P. Canellos, of the 
Harvard Medical School. 
Canellos is scheduled to deliver 
several talks, one of which -

He emphasized that the 
major function of Southwest 
Fisheries Center is to gather 
basic scientific information, 
not to write the management 
plans. 

When asked if Southwest 
Fisheries had any research 
responsibilities related to

whales, Carr responded that it 
didn't as yet, but that the 
Northwest facilities were 
involved in this type oJf research 
on marine mammals. 

Yellowfin tuna (ThunDus 
a1bacares) is the most valuable 
fisbery resource landed in 
California. SWFC scientists 
provide basic fishery analysis 
and management information 
to the regional councils, who 
determine optimum sustain-
able yields for the tuna in-

dustry. 
One of the ongoing concerns 

of the SWFC is to find a way to 
reduce the porpOise kill to 
levels approaching zero, in 
order to comply with the 
Marine Mammal Protection 
Act of 1972.

By PhlUp Sorensen 

The UCSD men 's fencing 
team, with virtually all of last 
year's team returning, should 
make a strong showing in the 
Western Intercollegiate 
Fencing League's 1978-79 
season, which begins October 
28 . 

.. I think we should finish in 
the upper one-third of our 
league," says coach John 
Helmich, returning (or his 
fourth season as fencing coach. 

There are three positions in 
fencing with UCSD fielding 
experienced fencers in all three 
events. Ed Amos, who fenced 
for UCSD as a sophomore 
before spending- his junior year 
in Madrid, is back as thetcam's 
number one epeeist. Dave 
Frankville, a senior returning 
for his fourth season, will fence 
as a foilist. Senior Greg Lee, 
with two years previous ex-
perience, will duel as a saber-
ist. 

Lee is quite confident of the 
team's chances. "I think we 
can take itthisyear ... We've got 
g~ potential in our younger 
guys, and we're set in all three 
events." 

The women's team is a little 
weak in numbers this year, as 
there are only four gir.Js out for 
the team - half the number on 
last year's Squad. With ex· 
perienced fencers Katherine 
Kassebaum and Lynn Dem-
shki, the team hopes to make up 
for their lack in numbers. 

The WIFL (Western Inter-
collegiate Fencing League) in 
which UCSD competes consists 
of ten teams on the NCAA 
Division III level. Cal State 
Northridge and Fullerton are 
considered to be the favorites in 
the league this year. Other 
teams in the NCAA which 
UCSD will be competing a-
gainst are UCLA, USC and 
SDSU . Even though these 
teams come from much larger 
sc hools, Helmich doesn't 
necessarily think that his team 
is put at a disadvantage. 

.. Fencing is considered a 
minor sport at most schools, 
and like all minor sports, it 
doesn't attract a lot of people." 

Consequently, smaller 
schools such as UCSD are able 
to compete on more or less an 
equal level. though the bigger 
Schools still have the advantage 
of having a larger student body 
to draw from . 

Helmich, who went to the 
nationals when he fenced for 
UCSD, doesn 't feel that fencing 
is getting the recognition it 
deserves. He cites a recent 
study published in Sports 

Illustrated as evidence. Of all of 
the sports requiring both 
physical and mental keenness , 
he said, the two most de-
manding were fenc'ing and

ByJoa liMa 

SUI. Writer 
The soccer team need not 

have shown up to their games 
this weekend , playing 110 
fruitless minutes of ball to 
succumb to league foes USIU 
and Southern California Col-
lege. 

With a 2-2 conference record, 
UCSD is a probable second or 
third place finisher in the NAJA 
Southern Conference. They will 
be eligible for a berth in the 

which determines the top DOn-
lint place team in the three 
California NAJA divisions) and 
a poaaible shot at the final 
playoffs If their overall season 
record is good enough. 

The Tritons met nationally 
ranked USIU Thursday at La 
Jolla Country Day School. 
USIU attacked the downwind 
goal in the first half, a big 
advantage on this gusty day. 
UCSD played well and held 
them to a 1~ edge at half-

NAJA " mini-Dlayoffs" ~~~~ 

In the next half, the San Diego 
players assumed the lou of the 
wind advantage would slow 
USIU down. Not so. "They 
seemed to have the golden 
touch ," said coach Stewart 
Hayes as he witnessed his team 
get bombarded with five more 
USIU goals that period, ending 
the contest at ~. 

A combination of factors 
defeated the Tritons in the 
second half. " It was sort of a 
letdown mentally. But USIU is 
a very skilled team," said the 
UCSD coach. 

Hoping to rebound from that 
embarrassment, the Tritons 
looked fired up as they took the 
field against Southern Cali-
fornia College Saturday . 
Though UCSD kept the ball 
deep in SCC territory, the 
offense, playing without re-
cently declared ineligible 
forward Greg Lyons, failed to 
put in a goal. One Jon Gold shot 
narrowly missed, hitting the 
goalpost. A Southern California 
player maneuvered his way 
past the defense to a wide-open 
shot to put his team ahead 1~ at 
halftime.

Grace Greenburg of her team's 
defeat of Whittier College last 
Saturday night. 

UCSD play.ed strong defen-
sive , as well as offens ive 
games, capturing the match in 
straight games, 15-4, 15·1, and 
15-4. Dawn Wilson , Cely Ber-
gado and Cheryl Wright high-
lighted the games with ex-
plosive rallies. Bergado aided 
her team by blocking single-
handedly several hard spikes. 
Every member of the team 
played a hard game. 

This enthusiastic spirit was 
apparent at Friday night's 
game against CSU Dominguez 
Hills, even though the Tritons 
were defeated. 

" We made too many ertors," 
commented Greenberg. " We 
knew this was going to be a 
tough game." 

UCSD managed to take their 
opponents through four games, 
2-15, 15-11 . 15-13 and 2-15. They 
dropped a n upse tting Hfth 
game. 7-15. Greenberg men· 
tioned that " it was the fi rst time 
any ' team has lasted against 
Domi nguez Hills for rive 
games . We're r eally proud of 
that accomplishment .' , 

Earlier in the week the team 
persevered and managed to 
squeeze by a strong USIU 
squad, 3-2. 

The Tritons lost the opening 
game 7-15. A strong fight was 
put up in the next game but the 
women were unable to come 
back and dropped this one, lO-
IS . 

It finally all came together in 
the third and crucial game . . 
Knowing that they had to win 
this one to stay in the match the 
women clobbered USIU 154. 
"It was that UCSD perse-
verance pulling us through," 
declared Greenberg. 

After a close 15·13 win in the 
fourth game the UCSD squad 
approached the fifth and final 
game of the match with their 
usual enthusiasm~ It went all 
the way down to the wire but the 
final score told the story - 16-
14, UCSD. 

The team hopes to " break 
500" by the end of the sea on. In 
an attempt to reach this goal 
they will take on USIU in a 
rematcl1 Wednesday afternoon 
in the Main Gym at 4: 00 pm.

I wondered if the hat I had on 
could reach down and swallow 
me. J stood before what J 
conceived to be forty of the best 
poets at UCSD and the sur-
rounding community at an open 
poetry reading. Of the five 
poems I've scribbled in my life 
three were in my hand. I looked 
down to my first poem. It was 
typically simplistic and ... I 
groaned ... it was the poem on ... 
of all things ... my acne. I didn 't 
know poets. Would they devour 
my every word and sadistically 
spit them out, labeling them as 
ridiculous chatter? Or would 
they just ponder.. . I started: 
" Beneath my left eye is a 
pimple, like a tear ... (the crowd 
smiled) and more along my 
mouth, they like it there, they 
like my face .... (the crowd 
laughed!) I relaxed. Did I thinlr 
poets do DOt suffer from acne? 

Closet poets like myseU can 
shine at open poetry readings, 
but those who just want to listen 
can attend readings by poets 
invited to the campus. Both 
open poetry readings and the 
regular readings, comprising 
the New Poetry Series, are 
operated as part of the Archive 
for New Poetry in the Central 
Library's Mandeville Depart-

'ment of Special Collections. 
Accordinl to Series coordina-

tor and literature professor 
Michael Davidson, the purpose 
of the Series is to provide stu· 
dents with an extension of the 
classroom by letting them 
experience an art directly from 
the creator. He also said the 
series compliments what he 
calls a strong emphasis in 
UCSD classes on post-modern 
art forms. 

Poets who are more experi-
mental in their work are 
invited, said Davidson. 

A more .. experimental " 
work could include, Cor ex· 
ample, a past production by 
poet Jackson MacLow in which 
he used media equipment and 
asked the audience to pa rtici· 
pate. 

F ilms are shown as part of 
the series. This quarte r two 
groups oC outtakes from the 
P oetry U.S.A. film s made 
during the sixties featuring 

Record Review 

Allen Ginsberg and Michael 
McClure (reading poems to 
lions at the San Francisco zoo) 
will be shown. 

The Series invites writers of 
prose also. The first guest this 
term is storyteller Bobbie 
Louise Hawkins. 

Davidson welcomes sug-
gestions as to whom should he 
invited to read. Most of the 
poets are from the west as fees 
paid by the Campus Events 
Boards do not cover plane fare . 

Some poets who have read in 
the past, such as Adrienne Rich 
and Robert Duncan, have 
attracted crowds of 200. Poetry 
readings are taped and cata-
loged in the Archive. 

The Archive, open to all 
students, represents an at-
tempt to collect all poetry in the 
English language written after 
World War II (post-modern 
poetry) . The Archive contains 
original manuscripts, entire 
collections by single authors, 
correspondence between poets 
and dissertations on post-
modern poetry. The Archive 
also collects small press 
publications suclJasPerisb8b1e 
Prell, Black Sun, Jargon, 
Fulcrum and Shameless 
Hussy. 

Subject files on general post-
modern topics sound just as 
creative as small press names: 
avant-garde theory, the " Beat" 
movement. Black Mountain 
poetry, Concretism, Confes-
sionalism, Ethnopoetics and 
San Francisco Renaissance. 

Poetry readings are held 
Wednesdays at 4 pm at the 
Revelle Formal Lounge. This 
quarter's schedule is: Bobbie 
Louise Hawkins , Oc t. 25;

and Rae Arm a ntrout, Nov. 29. 

The Outtake Series will be 
presented in Central Library 
room 236 at 10 am on Thursday 

'Fish' Smells Sweet 
Bluegrass fans will certainly 

want to check out Fresh Fish 
Mason Williams' first album i~ 
seven years. If the name rings a 
bell, you may well have heard 
of Williams in connection with 
various media - Williams has 
tried his hand at television 
writing and performance (with 
such showmen as the Smothers 
Brothers , Glen Campbell , 
Roger Miller, Pat Paulsen, and 
Andy Williams) , poetry (ever 
hear the hilarious "Them Toad 
Suckers" or " Them Tummy 
Gummers") or on radio -
Williams was the writer oC the 
hit "Classical Gas" a while 
back. 

For " Fresh Fish," Williams 
has teamed up with the Santa 
Fe Recital, an able bluegrass 
g roup whose InstrumentaUon 
inc ludes bass , cello , fiddle 
banjo, dobro and drums as weli 
as acoustic guitar, played by 
Williams himseJf.

Women's Art Exhibit 
Mixes Media, Styles 

By Belli Aeeomaado 
The first exhibit at the 

Mandeville Gallery this year is 
L.A. Women Narrations, an 
eclectic collection of con-
temporary art by women. The 
show runs from October 6 to 
October 27. 

Narrations brings together a 
variety of styles and media, so 
that one is bound to find 
something to enjoy and some-
thiDi to dislike. For me the 
least successful works a re a 
collection of mixed . media 
pieces by three Las Vegas 
showgirls. Although I find these 

piece~ unappealing, they do 
renect strong personal state-
ments about anger and violence 
that are both frightening and 
sad. To accompany these works 
Kathy Kaurrman has made a 
video-taped interview with the 
three showgiris. The interview 
deals with the lives of these 
women and their artwork . 

Another artist at the ex-

bibition is Carole Caroompas, 
who is repr esented by " In 
Search of the Perfect Love," a 
soa p opera- li ke series of 
collages depicting a sad r0-
mantic relationship. 

Rita Yokoi offers an offbeat 
three Wmensional work en· 
titled "In Anticipation of a 
Message of Love." The work 
consists of a hot pink dome and 
a hot pink parrot both iI-
lumina ted in a pink light. Yokoi 
claims that the dome is repre-
sentative of female/intuition 
and that the .parrot is repre-
sentative of male/intellect. but 
that all people have both 
elements within themselves. 

The strangest piece of the 
show is Sylvia Salazaar Simp-
son's " Tutti Frutti," a dress· 
like gauze hanging which has 
rotting fruit attached to it. 
Simpson's work is the only one 
that includes the dimensiOn of 
smell. Simpson says that her 
obsession for food stems from

the fact that she "grew up in a 
country where food and the lack 
of food was very much in 
evidence." 

The works which impressed 
me the most are those done by 
Victoria Nodiff and Karen 
Carson, Nodiff's works are 
intricate watercolors that deal 
with images from her everyday 
life . Carson's works are a 
collection of sketches showing 
"How to Draw a . . . " These 
sketches are wonderful be-
cause they radiate a charm and 
a humorous tone. 

In addition to the art show 
itself is a performance called 
" Waitresses" on October 27 atS 
pm (admission is free) . The 
performance is by six feminist 
artists who use their l4Ih years 
of waitress experience to 
create a portrait of working 
life .

(COill from PIlle 1) 

bef~ the specified deadline. 
"Student's expectations are too 
hilf't ... tbey siln tbeir offer 
lettP.r and expect their check 
the next day," said Rutter. 

Anotber common student 
complaint is that the system is 
impersonal and the staff 
unresponsive to student needs. 
One student (name allO with-
held) commented, "they (the 
staff) are more concerned that 
you fOe the correct papers, 
cl'Ol8iD& your t's and dotting 
your i's than with the needs of 
the students."

goal. 

"Our main concern," he said, 
"is to discover adequate 
porpoise-saving techniques to 
separate porpoise from tuna, 
which are caught commer-
cially. We have worked on 
developing proper-size mesh 
nets , and recent tests of 
porpoise 'aprons' and 'chutes' 
(trapezoidal-shaped sectbns of 
webbing appended to porpoise 
safety panels) promise a 
means of making small-mesh 
netting compatible with tuna 
purse seine performance." 

The operation currently in 
use is called Backdown, where-
by the ship backs up until the 
net sinks a little below the 
surface, allowing the porpoise 
to escape. Barham also worked 
on an extensive aerial survey of 
west coast dolphin habitats and 
movements. 

Richard Irvin, a young fleet 
assistance aide, described his 
duties related to the project: 
"We hold classes downtown to 
inform tuna fishermen about 
the federal regulations, and 
hold inspections to make sure 
they have the proper nets and 
other equipment." 

When asked if he had ever 
met with a negative reaction 
from the fishermen, Irvin 
replied, "The fishermen are 
bas~cally good people ... Our 
observers at sea don't en-
counter any bad vibes with 
them - they realize we're just 
out there doing a job. I love 
going to sea with those guys. " 

Carr described other func-
tions of t.he fishery center as 
"everything from studying the 
environment in which these 
marine animals live through 
measuring population sizes. We 
have to be able to identify eggs, 
larvae, etc. Then we have a 
:-ather extensive aquarium 
ll':Stem to raise the animals in 
fqr research. Our research 
IOvolves oceanographers, 
physical oceanographers, 
meteorologists,_ mathema-
ticians, populAtion dyoami-
ci1lts, economists, physiologiSts 
aad chemists. We often hire 
s dents on a part-time basis." 

Carr also explained the 
i portance of weather con-

tions and meteorological data 
in their research. 

"Fish, tuna in particular, 
tend to concentrate around 
temperature boundary layers. 
So we furnish some tuna boats 
with instruments for tempera-
ture sampling, and they report 
in to us every day," Carr said. 

Ann Klein, unit director of 
Muir financial aid, feels her 
staff, many of which are 
students, is "very conscien-
tious arid sincerely interested 
in the students." Klein said 
many student-oriented im-
provements have been made in 
the office, such as the stream-
liniq of forms, to simpUfy the 
application proceaa. 

Accol'diq to Klein, one way 
the SFS bas attempted to meet 
specifiC student problems is 
thJ"OUlh the emergency loan 
proeram. A student with a 
financial crisis can apply for a 
short-term, interest-free loan, 
available within 24 hours of 
applyin,. Upon repayment, 
these funds are recycled back 
to other students with financial 
emergencies. 

Paulette Rose, director of 
Warren and Tbird College 
financial aid, stressed that, 
with the ever-increasing vol-
ume of financial aid recipients, 
students should make ap-
pointments to discuss problems 
with their counselors rather 
than just drop in and wait. In 
this way, the financial aid staff 
can deal more efficiently with 
student problems, as well as 

their regular workload, ac-
cording to Rose. 

"Financial aid people don't 
speak EnJ{lish, they speak 
CWS, BEOG, SER (initial 
letters of various financial aid 
forms) ... the office needs to 
meet middle ground between 
efficiency and effectiveness 
(by effectiveness meaning the 
meeting of personal student 
needs)," said William Byrd, 
director of the Educational 
Opportunity Program (EOP). 

While Byrd believes financial 
aid distributes the money 
efficientiy, he advocates the 
counseling of students on how to 
spend this money. "Many folks 
have never had that kind of 
money and don't know how to 
handle it." He believes that 
Financial Services need the 
support of other student serv-
ices in counseling. 

Byrd also believes there is a 
need for a campus-wide orien-
tation about fiIlancial aid in 
order to clarify the procedures 
for freshmen and save them 
from problems later. Byrd said 
from his experience, he has 
seen that problems with money 
have an adverse affect on other 
aspects of a student's academic 

life. 
When a student applies for 

financial aid, bis file is proc-
eBBed in the followine way: 
First, a budget is established, 
takinl into consideration a 
student's marital status and 
living situation on or off 
campus. Every student's 
budaet is calculated by stan-
dards which are applied 
equally to each student. From 
this figure, outside reaources 

such as family and student 
contributions, federal or vet-
erans' benefits are subtracted. 
The resultinl figure is a 
student's need which is then 
filled by university funding. 
This can be in the form of 
Irants and scholarships, loans 
or work-study. 

Students can still apply for 
aid for winter, quarter. Klein 
advises, "if you feel you have a 
need, apply, and apply early." 

Cop-'Here to Help' 
(Coal. from pale") 
down the street and says 'bi' to 
somebody, and they (just) look 
at him or don't say anything. An 
officer is just a human being 
... you get that feeling Uke, hey 
shit, what the ... " 

At UC Santa Cruz, where 
Sanchez also worked as a 
poUceman, he and his fellow 
officers spent a considerable 
amount of time in the coffee 
shops. He explained, "that's 
where we knew the students 
and there was a trust there." 
He would like to see that 
tradition happen at UCSD. but 

until recently, he said, there 
haven't been coffee shops open 

. for students at night, except for 
the Coffee Hut. 

"To 'summarize it all up," 
Sanchez said, "if we can help 
the students realize that law 
enforcement people are there 
to help them, when they 
graduate from here and go 
home, they will give tbe other 
policemen in their jurisdic-
tions where they live a chance, 
saying hey, these officers at 
UC, they used to help us out a 
lot . (Maybe) they'll go to 
another policeman and say: 
'hey, they're not all badges'."
