Who Will Reign at the Student Center? 
Administrators 
and Students 
Vie for Power 

Bv WENDY PA LSON 
- Staff Wri ter 

The ~tudent Cenler has long be n a 
focus for heated relations between the 
students and the administration at 
UCSD. Differing concepts of power 
held by both groups are pres nting 
problems in current efforts to reins tate 
a Student Center Director. 

In October 1981.1he Student C('nter 
began its first year in limbo when 
Directoro Roland Buck left his position 
because of growmg on-the-job pres-
... ures_ In 19~2. there was an unsuc-
re ... sful attempt to fill an Operations 
Coordinator position, :\Iore recently. 
step have been taken to rerunt an 
ass i..,tant \ ict' chancellor to be rco.;pon -
Sible for the newly conceptualized 
''l'nivcrslt \' Ccnter." ThiS act IOn is 
based on a report b~' the St udent 
(('n ter Ta ... k Force. a group apPOinted 
b) Viee l ha nCl'lIor of l ndergrad ua te 
Affair..,josepth Watson_ Their purpose 
was to "make recommendations re-
g,lrcltng the Inls:-.ion and structure of 
the :tudent Center." according to the 
Task Forct:' Report released on March 
·1. 1983 to Watson . 

Task Force Report Proble m a tic 
The Report proved problematic for 

students in two ways: 1) Thecontents 
and proposed changes were unsatis-
factory to them: and 2) the procedure 
following the release of the report 
violated "all due process for st udents. " 
The students voicing these claims are 
the Students For Control of Student 
Fees (SFC F) a !,rroup of 28 people 
Illvohed III tudent Center activities 
who banded together to protest the 
Task Force Report and Its implications 
for the Student Center. They are also 
the authors of an open letter to the 
editors of the Guardian appearing in 
thc April 7. 198:3 issue v,;hich explained 
ho\\ t hey felt due process \\'a s violated. 

The Task Force Report conceives of 
th Student Center as a "Uni\crslty 
Center that im Ites faeult\' and staff to 
feel welcome to part(cipate With 
students III Its acitivities and pro-
h'Tams and to use the facilities ." 
Watson feels that the "Univl'rsity 
Centu" should be the "living room of 
the campus." 

The offiCial Report was released on 
March ,I to Watson . He discussed It 
with the Studl'nt Center Board (SCB) 
on March 10. when it supposedl\ 
became public to all students, But 
:\1llch Sosna. former member of thl' 
Reg Fee Committee. the i\S Council 
and thl' SCB and current member of 
SFCSF. explatned that on this date 
"The n.'(x)rt hadn't been seen b\

to have the operations III the Student

Upon hearing Watson's plan for 
recommendation. the 28 Students For

Dean Appalled at Lack 
of Journalistic Ethics 
Editor: 

I am appalled at the lack of 
journalistic ethics displayed 
by Jeff Savitch (sic) in an 
article concerning the Student 
Center and Vice Chancellor 
Watson (May 2). 

Jeff spoke to me briefly 
asking questions about the 
Board of Directors in the early 
day of Third College, 
implying that he was doing an 
article on the history of the 
college. He did not identify his 
aims of writing an article 
intended to malign V.C .Jo!>eph 
Watson. He asked for. and was 
given material from "The 
History of Third College." I 
told him then that the material 

was written by st udents and 
its reliability was sorely 
questioned by all (st udents, 
faculty, and administrators) 
who were present at the time. I 
told him that I did not want to 
be quoted on anything 
concernll1g that time period, 
and was not present then and 
had heard enough concerns 
about the material he was 
requesting to not want my 
name associated with it. 

I was disturbed and angered 
to read the article he wrote. I 
am further addened at his 
lack of ethics, as well as his 
deplorable lack of facts.

Letters to the Editor 

Papp: A Bombastic Know-it-All 
Editor: 

Just what the hell does this 
Papp fellow think he's playing 
at? I shiver to think of the 
future articles there are in 
store for us now he has become 
Feature Editor. It was bad 
enough when Papp alone 
wrote the smug, bomba!>tic 
pieces tha t he, and I imagined 
only he, enjoys so dearly , but 
now I see hordes of them being 
written under his aegis. 

One a pect of his see-how· 
clever·l-am style annoys me 

more than all the res t 
combined, to whit. his 
in atiable desire to s how his 
readers he knol(ls all there is 10 
knolL' abollt Ellg/and. Hardly 
an article has gone by in which 
he has not dropped some 
ostentatious hint to this effecl. 
Why, even as an editor, Papp 
managed to slip in a reference 
to "Harley Street physicians" 

and to "sem i-deta c hed 
bungalows." two conspicuous· 
Iy English phrases. This is 
UCSD, not Cambridge. and It 
would behoove him to 
rememb r this. I can only be 
Ihankful that Papp did not 
give himself space for an 
article 111 the last issue. Most 
thoughtful of him.

Enough of Watson 
On Savage's Analysis of Student 
Center Proposal and VC Watson 

Editor: 
I hope your article on Dr.Joe 

Watson's usurpation of power 
angers a lot of students. You 
presented us with a semi-
objective description of his 
true motives. [ say "semi-
objective" because he i much 
worse than the parameters of 
journalism allow you to admit. 
He is not. however, atypical in 
this campus. Let us not forget 
that he was assigned to his 
post by the then incoming 
Chancellor Atkinson. This 

was done despite the prote ts 
of many student organiza-
tions. Wa tson achieved his 
position by ignoring st udent 
and staff input. something 
which is highly rewarded at 
UCSD. It is about time we all 
joined in a concerted effort to 
get rid of this man who collects 
a handsome salary, paid 
mostly by our fees, and use 
his posit ion to sti fie student 
input in our Student Center. 

Editor: 
I am writing in regards to 

Jeff Savage's analysis of the 
Student Cemer proposal and 
Joe Watson (May 2). As a 
concerned student who has 
so me knowledge of the 

tudent Center / Univers ity 
Center debate. I was more 
than a little up~et at the onc-
sided, black-a nd ·white (no 
grey areas here, folks) picture 
which Mr. Savage ex tended to 
st udent s.

that Dr. Watson " .. wanted to

Chancellor of the lJnivel'Slty 
Center' to cont 1'01 I he new 
center. He (Dr. Watson) would 
control the ASSistant Vice· 
Chancellor of the IJniverslty 
Center." At thiS time, there 
exists an Assi~tant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life 
who oversees the St udent 
Center as well a!>other s tudent 

~ervices . The general Idea of 
this new title (not positIOn) IS 

to recruit a qualified person 
with a background of working 
for, in, and with Student 
Unions who could oversee the 
St udent Cen ter (renamed 
University Center) in 
expanded programs and 
growth . Thi!> was a recom-
mendation of the Task Force, 
but [ will come to them later. 

ear the end of his article, 
Jeff avage asked why, if 
Phase:3 were built, would it be 
under Dr. Watson's super· 
vision . Why not the Vice 
Chancellor of ,\lanagement 
and Facllitie~ ? I don't really

Unlversily has been here and 
defimtl'ly since the Student

(Whether Joe Wal son hml 

anything to do with the plans I 
cannot say.) There is also a 
slight error in the wordmg 
used in this passage, it should 
read, 'There is a plan to 
expand the Student Center 
into a multi·purpo e facilit y." 
The words just got a little 
mixed up in the article, after 
all, It sounds as if the Student 
Center is going to be torn 
down . There is discussion of 
remodeling, but it would be 
rather a waste to start over 
from scratch. 

There is al so Mr. Savage '~ 
dl'>cusslOn of [he Task Force 
and the "Ta sk Force ~eport" 
to u'>e hi.., quote marks. The 
Task Force he felt. was too 
\\l' lght ed by admll1lstrators 
and faculty. I agrpt'. Then' 
s hould ha\ e been more 
~ t udent s on the committee. 
Yet. I also wonder as to when

Indi\lduals VOiced thler

of the Task Forcl'. On one 
cxca"l<J1l I was In volvcd With a

it could be that 1Tl thiS case ])r. 
Wahon dldn't let am st udent s

But then. the Student Center 
Hoard had to know, they had a 
studen t representative on the 
Task Force. Maybe they kept 11 
CI secret too. Anot her question 
which comes to mind in thiS 
matter is who wanted this 
Ta!>k Force anyway? I was 
under the impression that it

Open House Was Lacking in 
Creative Display of Wares 
Editor: 

I would like [0 expre~s 
disagreement with your staff 
writer Glen Iyemura who 
dc<.'med Open House a success. 
My opinion is based on 
comparison with the Open 
House of previous years and is 
supported by input tha t came 
to me from my wife and other 
observers. The great contrast 
between this year's Open 
Ilouse and those III ot her 
years, particularly in '81 when 
I believe it reached its acme, 
was the \'irtual absence of 
goocl intellectual fair for tho e 
that expect of the university 
someth ing more than 
enterlamment. Thus 111 the 
past I believe that the Open 
Hou se exhibib have been 
highl y stimu la ting and 
representat ive of I hf' non ivory· 
tower approach that many of 
our professors are capable of 
when they consider the~e 
effort s wort hwhile. 

something , the Impression 
created was excellent as was 
the neat idea of Chancellor 
Atkinson to make himself 
available from a "pen." This 
was democracy at Its best and I 
know t hat many people, 
i nclud ing myself. apprecia ted 
t he com munity effort. 

I believe that thi s yea r .... 
effort was disapPOinting 
because most of the feal ures 
noled abo\ e were absent. ThiS 
absence occurred at a time 
\\ hen I he lIni \'ersit \' I.., 
threalened from all ~ Icl es and 
needs the sympathy and 
eneoll ragemen t of I he 
taxpayer, who visits on this 
occasion and informs his 'her 
fri end s of the goings on. 
Furthermore President 
Reagan is promot i ng "techno-
logy" and "creati\' it y." From 
where? The universities! 

put new life 1I1to thiS Open 
Iiouse organizat ion which ha -.

its well being.

By N INA MANZI 

S ta ff Wri t er 
Saturday morning I came 

home from Kenneth Trefftzs' 
UCSD Exten s ion -spon sored 
seminar on "How to read the 
Waif Street jouYl/o!" in time to 
watch the I09th runningoflhe 
Kentucky D e rby. T h e 
attraction of each was t he 
element of risk, that potent ial 
of un li mited success v ia 
ca reful planning and a litt le bit 
of help from Lad y Luck tha t 
has character ized man ever 
since Adam a nd Eve dec ided to 
give tha t red fru it a taste with 
the hope of ga ining unlimited 
k nowledge and wisdom . 

Playi ng the S tock Market is 
a gamble, and alt houg h the 
at mosphere at t he Top of the 
Arc Room at the Harbor [s la nd 
Travelodge was unl ike that of 
the clubhouse at Churchill 
Downs. the Wall StreetJournal 
is clearl y the Racing Form of 
the finan cial world. Those a t 
Mr. Trefft zs' sem inar differed 
in apperan ce but not in spirit 
from the l<un yo n esque 
characters that populate the 
racet racks of the world , for 
they are a ll knights questIng 
after gamblIng's \erSlon of the 
Holy Grail: they seek, in short . 
an inSide edge. But there's a 
[-atch to c\crything, and the 
catch to u si ng the Wall Street 
Journal as a source of hot 
market tips is this: It involves 
the investment of a lot of time 
and a lot of money. 

In a sense, horse racing is a 
less risky proposition, as it

missionary zeal to stop the 
slave trade on the east African 
coast. it was only later, in the 
process of exprf'ssIng their 
Victorian urge to do ~()mething 
good, after Li\'lngston and all 
the other explorf'rs, that they 
realized therf' \\as a unique 
sourcf' of wildlife. And then a 

fairl~ astounding eHnt 
occurred. Con~en ation v. as 
locked into place within ten to 
fifteen years. The questIOn is: 

David Western at Belkin Lecture more and more Wa t ts 111 which you put the quantit\ of life before thc quality of lile . Only 
III thIS ~ituation could \'Oll 
anllClpate another \<\'a tl 

Why? 
Historically , thf' reason is 

that by this time, Europe in 
particular, had gone through 
the whole romantic period, 
and t hey had become 
extremely aware of wildlife. 
They were qUite familiar with 
the exterminatIon of a bison in 
North America. They were 
also concerned that the 
exploitation of the bison 
undermined the cu lture of the 
American Indian. And this 
would be replicated in Africa if 
the sam attitude as the 
Americans had been taken. 

So being concerned to do 
something about it. they 
protected wildlife for [wo 
reasons . First to conserve 
wildlife in Its own nght, 
perhaps for the first time 
anywhere in the world. And 
second I y, to protect the righ lS 
of the indigenou~ people who 

used wildlife as a hunt Illg 
rcsource. The extraordinary 
idf'a herf' is t ha t the Ic:,en e in 
those day,; featured not "0 
much an IIlterl'st III \\ t1dllfc, 
but wildlife and peopil' In their 
primItive statf'. 

Plea.,c cxplai n the 
difference bet ween the 
American and the British 
ecologis t ? 

The typical Engl ish 
researcher does not ha\e a 
long formal training. They 
simply work out in the field , 
then come back a few years 
later to augment theIr 
experiences with formal Ideas. 
The Americans are far more 
structured prior to going into 
the field, and thtrefore they 
come with highly refined 
ideas . The di fference is 
reflected in the product. The 
British approach tends to be 
far more exploratory. The 
American,; tend to be far more 
tructured. 
There is a far greater 

expectation of how things 
s hould be wllh the American 
student. If the local East 
African situa tion is not what 
the student expected, they 
lend to be put off far more 
easily and dIscouraged. 

Wlwn'as t he ex pccta t]()11 on 
the British siele IS thai \ '0\1 arc 
thnm n out into the field, ann 
this IS the tlllle \oulearn how 
thing reall) ari.'. You clther 
make It or \ ou do not. And to 
some extent there IS a failure 
ra te. But the t YPt' of person 
\\ho IS thrcmn out inlo the 
field IS alread\" so hea\'ily 
selected that the failure rate is 
less than in an American 
situation. 

How exten s ive is t h e 
s tude nt involvem e nt in t h e 
East African e nvironme n-
ta l,m ovem e n t? 

The social extended family 
concept of Kenyans is all 
important to the way in which 
they become involved in 
events . When the younger 
people became interested in 
wildlife, it became a social 
activity. So they formed the 
"Wildlife Clubs of Kenya." 
The clubs are in 700 of the 
1,000 Kenyan secondary 
schools. The Kenyan students 
come together on weekends to 
hire a bus and venture out into 
the country. The enjoyment in 
nat ure is not so much the one-
on·one event as you have here 
in American, it is not the 
individual going out and 

finding thel11sl,lf in Ihe 
wilderness. For I\en\"<lns 1\ IS

strong base politically and 
they have made se\ era I 
marches, which produced the 
ban against hunting in 1977 
and the ban on the sale of 
trophies in 1978. They no\\ 
regularly have political rallie:, 
all over thecountrv to raise the 
consciousness of ilOt only the 
average mdividual in school 
but also the national 
politicians and policy makers.

I can only approach this 
Question by analogy. The 
scenario you would have to 
const ruct is a worsening of t he 
economic situation that exisls 
in the U today - bringingout

" lias this produ ced an

answer is nu. The answer is 
Britain. Britain has gone 
thruugh a tremendous and 
sustained peri(xl of worsenmg 
ecunonn. The remarkable 
thing here is the qualit y of the 
en\'ironment IS sti ll an 
important issue in Britalll. 
The amount of effort they are 
putting Ie)\\arcls Ihe environ·

a countrv which is basically 
having a harder and harder 
time justifying it. I think that 
this is a hopeful picture for the 
present generation'S attitude 
towards nature. Theq ualityof 
life is a thing that must be 
maintained. We ha\'e reached 
a more enlightened era where 
quality wil he our guide for

By MICHA EL AHN litigation, a l imo n y, T.V . 
din ners, weapons and other 
assorted dementia that made 
them wa rped and unusua l. 
Wes' mot he r was huge, 
weighi n g probably 300 
pounds. a nd rich beyond her 
needs, except maybe eat ing 
T.V. dinners - the only food 
served at Wes' home. The 
home was huge and whatever 
decorations there were, were 
coverep with trash - dirty 
laundry, newspapers, broken 
toys, shoes, bicycle parts , and 

Wes' stepbrother loved 
guns. He enjoyed reading 
about them and polishing 
them, fond ling, and above all, 
carrying them. He made his 
li vi ng as a plumber (one of the 
businesses that Wes' mother 
owned) and before he went out 
on any job he made damn sure 
that hi . forty-five caliber 
automat ic pistol was s trapped 
tightly under his left armpit. 
loaded and ready for 
immediate use. As far as [ 
knew, he carried it at all Urnes 

T he d ays of growi ng up 
were t he days of The Lurch: 
t hat feeling you 'd get when 
you were called before the 
class to g ive a speech , t rying 
ou t for spor ts, or t a lking to the 
beauti fu l gi rl in your E ng lish 
class. It was the feeling t hat 
you'd get righ t befo re a 
particu larly harrowing drop 
on a roll er coaster ride; 
stomach chur n i n g and 
working on too much 
adrenaline. Awkward didn't 
even begin to describe it; 
there's nothing worse than the 
fear of fai lure at thirteen. 

Wes was a friend unlike the 
ones I have now. Wes was the 
kind of friend with whom most 
time was spe nt doing

stumbllllg around backyards 
and canyons III gangling, 
Ull\\ leJch boclies that were 
grO\\ 'lI1g' Illuch too fast. We 
elidn'l talk Illuch. and we 
didn't hel\e a great deal to do 
\\ Ith realit\·.lt was a IlI cewav 
to grow: 'i n backyards and 
can\"ons. It was easier than 
get ling zits or clumsi ly asking 
girls to go skating or playing 
football and fucking up in 
front of t he coach. Of course 
there was glamour in taking 
risks; you might be handsome 
and the girl might say yes or 
you mIght catch the winning 
touchdown, but Wes and I 
weren't ready for chances or 
risks ; not yet. 

FEATURED PHOTO 

Wes was so normal he was 
on the edge of being bland. He 
had freckles and a shock of 
halkurly, flaming red hair 
like a house on fire. He was of 
average height, average bui ld, 
had an average I.Q ., and did 
average in school. He was the 
everyman of Standly Junior 
H igh, the guy in the midd le, 
the one whose face you might 
recognize but whose name 
would elude you, someone who 
would be remembered but not 
missed. Girls would call him a 
nice guy and teachers would 
recall that he was a good 
worker. 

Wes was part of a family 
that was held together by 

dust: dust everywhere. Wes' 
mother did not clean; I don't 
think she felt the need to. She 
had been married five or six 
times (the number was never 
made clear to me) and 
supported Wes, an older 
stepbrother, and a younger 
stepsister in this huge, trashed 
out s uburban home with 
a limony . She bought Wes 
anything he wanted, bul he 
wasn't very greedy. She 
bought Wes' older stepbrother 
all sorts of weapons which he 
loved and cherished with all 
his heart. 

except when asleep or in the 
shower, and even thcn it 
wasn't far away. I tried to get 
an explanation from Wes and 
he ju·t shrugged and said, 
"Oh, he just likes the feel of 
it."

Re-en tering Reality 
continued from page 7 
is enough to send any recent 
graduate into a state of shock. 
Without a doubt, the appliance 
that will create the most 
commotion, not to mention 
confusion, wi\1 be the in-house 
washer & dryer, minus the 
ooin slots. After four years of 
frantically searching for dimes 
and quarters in pant pockets, 
junk drawers and under couch 
cushions, free laundry will be 
a dream come true. Note: Do 
not be too overzealous. If you 
are taken by the moment and 
offer to do the family's laundry 
indefinitely, they may take 
you up on it. 

league educated employers. 
They will not discriminate on ' 
the grounds of scuffed loafers. 
In fact , it could be a foot in the 
door_ 

In those states with an 
abundance of sun and 
swimming pools, phone sitting 
is approached in the following 
manner: Take one phone with 
an extra long cord, one iced tea 
with lemon , one boltle of 
suntan oil, one bath towel, one 
chaise lounge and one portable 
radio out to the pool; now 
sunbathe and reduce stress 
while waiting for the blessed 
event. Note: If the phone 
results prove to be a 
disappointment, you'll sti ll 
have the distinct advantage of 
a healthy glow for your next 
interview. 

By far, the most difficult 
collegiate cord to cut is the one 
that connects you to the 
friends that have literally been 
your family for four year _ 

Enter the friends that you 

left behind four years earlier, 
the people you once considered 
irreplaceable, who now appear 
to be just"a substitute for the 
real thing_ It's not that you 
deserve better, after all, a few 
of those friends may be going 
through similar withdrawals 
from their college buddies, and 
may be feeling equalJy 
dissatisfied with you as a

not unusual for We to take 
long timeouts from school to 
work on his mother's houses. I 
later discovered that he had 
run away to his sister's house 
in Los Angeles. We were 
fifteen then; I had known him 
for three years. He hadn't said 
goodbye or called. [ went to his 
house and his mother '.vas 
home wit h his tepbrother and 
stepsister, but I didn't go in, I 
didn't even ring the doorbell. 
We was gone. 

He called me a year later. I 
had new friends then, a new 
car, and was at a new high 
school. Things were happen-
ing fast and I was beginning to 
think that there was light at

asked him why he ran away 
and all he would say was that 
"things became unbearable" 
with his mother. Later that 
week [ found out just how 
unbearable it was. 

We ' mother wa arre ted 
for keeping one-hundred and 
twenty poodles in her house. 
Among the charges filed 
al!ainst her was one for child 
abuse because of the little girl, 
Wes' stepsister, who had to 
live there. The dogs had been 
in the house for months 
defecat ing and urinating all 
over. According to tho e who 
went in to retrieve the 
animals, the smell was beyond 
terrible. All three local T . V. 
news stations covered the 
story and they had plenty of 
shots of dogs being led out of 
Wes' mother's hou se, and 
plenty of the :WO-pound 
woman crying in the streets 
because they were taking her 

"babies" away. TheT.V. new 
dubbed her the dog lady and 
she becamea bad joke, the kind 
where nobody laughs. 

I remember Wes on the 
phone. He sounded older, but 
that was inevitable, I hadn't 
seen him in a year. But hi, 
voice caught and dragged like 
tha t of someone who was tired , 
who had been rushed into 
situations he never wanted, 
that maybe no one wou ld ever 
want if they had the choice. 
Wes had grown becau se it 
wasn ' t safe for him; his family 
had no sanity to spare for 
themselves, let alone for him . 

He is in Georgia now , living 
with another sister, working 
in a plant assembling car" for 
five dollars an hour. The city

from Wes' mother because of 
"child neglect;' . Wes' mother 
is suing the city. As far as I

Co-op Staff 
continued from page 5 
available when students could 
not, especially during finals. A 
s taff member could devote 
more time to a co-op without 
worrying about commitments 
to schoolwork . 

A staff member would 
supposedly be a person who 
could take responsibility for a 
co·op, making sure everything 
got done, and organizing work 
more efficiently. 

One experienced co-op 
leader said that, "The co-ops 
never would have been 
developed if it wasn 't for non-
students," and that it was a 
"minor miracle" that they 
have succeeded this well. "The 
co-ops would not subvert their 
own essence. They are doing 
this for the benefit of 
students," he said. 

Many feel that the General 
Store's continuing success has 
been mostly attributable to 
manager Bob Corlew, 33, who 
took only eight unit per 
quarter and skipped every 
wmter quarter to work in the 
store. Corlew , aid he works 
between 40 and 70 hours a 
week. compared to a 20-40 
hour work week when the 
store opened about three years 
ago. He noted that no student 
could be expected to do this. 

The SCB al '0 discussed the 
possibility that staff positions 
could upset the cooperative 
atmosphere of a co-op if the 
staff member became too 
dominant. 

"If we hire a staff member, 
we don't know it won't turn 
into an enterprise like the Bike 
Shop," said Jensen. 

The Bike 'hop was 
originally a co-op, but is no 
longer considered so. "It 10, t 
something of what it used to 
be," said one SCB member. It 
was explained at the SCB 
meeting that now to 
participate, a student must 
have more than just a 
superficia l knowledge of 
bicycles and a des ire to learn . 

The co-ops contend this is 
unlikely to happen again, due 
to carefully-written job 
descriptions and co-op 
constitutions designed to 
"guard against" such an 
occurence. 

A C&E report to the SCB 
explained that no precedent 
was being set because of 
earlier staff positions at the 
Bike Shop and Groundwork 
Books in 1978, However, now 
that the question has come up 
again in 1983, there is a feeling 
among the Board members 
that whatever they decide will 
be the basi s for future 
decisions . 

"We are really researching 
the po s ition . It 's not 
something we 've done 
nippingly," !:laid Marson . "We 
want to make sure this doe!:l11 't 
hurt co-ops." 

Jensen would like the 
relationship of the co-ops to 
the Student Center and the 
University to be better 
defined. "In the past it has 
been convenient for the co-ops 
not to define it, using the 
ambiguity for their own 
benefit," said Jensen . 

He also want co·ops to be 
more "accountable, e pecially 
since co-ops a re a llot ted 
$14.000 from the Student 
Center."

Joe Wolf's big bat suddenly went silent and 
Eric Reynolds and the Triton defense gave up 
two runs in the sixth and four more in the' 
seventh . In the process UCSD blew a 3-1 lead 
and went on to drop a 7-4 decision to Westmont 
in the first round of the NAJA District III 
playoffs in Los Angeles on Saturday. 

Despite a rather disappointing season, the 
abrupt ending has come a~ somewhat of a 
surprise considering the Tritons had finally 
tu rned their season around last week by 
winning three of their last four to gain a spot in 
the playoffs. . 

The offense wa responsible for the late 
season turnaround and it remained alive and 
well on Saturday as UCSD banged out twelve

hits, alt hough run production was limited to 
four as Westmont 's Doug Davis and Warren 
Dickey managed to pitch out of trouble 
throughout the afternoon. 

Brian Kummer, playing his last game as a 
Triton, drove in Don Petersen and Scott 
Melendrez to post UCSD to a 2-0 lead in the top 
of the first inning. Eric Reynolds was greeted.

The UCSO 's women 's 
tenni team wrapped up it~ 
final meet on Friday with an8· 
I victory over Division II UC 
Riverside. According to coach 
Li z Dudash, "Everyone played 
really well " and the victory 
"gave the Tritons confidence 
for the Nationals" coming up 
this week. 

Dudash is optim istic about 
the Nationals, which begin 
today in Claremont. The 
whole squad will play in the 
NCAA Division III team 
championships Monday and 
Tuesday, when the Tritons 
wi ll cont end with pla yers from 
the top eight teams in the 
nation . The main competition 
will come from California 
schools and from one North 
Carolina team, a lso reputed to 
be tough. Individual matches 
wi ll take place on Wednesday, 
with Sturdivant, Gilbert, and 
Akimoto representing UCSD 
in s ingl es, and team s 
Sturdiva nt -Akimoto a nd 
Gi lbert-Neal in doubles. 

Men's Tennis Hopes for Upsets 

The highlight of Friday's 
meet was Cathy Sturdivant's 
si ngles match, in which she 
defeated Riverside's No. 1 
player, Skye Scheer, 6-1, 2-6, 
6-4. Says the coach, "Sturdi-
vant had her first big win of 
the season" in a tough match 
against a hard -hitting 
opponent. Then Sturdivant 
joined Nadine Akimoto to play 
"the best doubles th ey've 
played all season " in a 7-5,6--1 
win . 

The only disappointment 
was the doubles match of Lisa 
(;ilbert and Dina Neal. which 
th ey lost in a tiebreaker in th(' 

Confident and in top shape 
after an excellent season, the 
Tritons are "keyed up" for the 
Nationals. Says Duda s h, 
"vVe're going in a" the number

People have long said that 
springtime in New York is the 
most exciting time of the year, 
and it's doubtful that a single 
member of the men's tennis 
team would disagree. After all, 
Head Coach Don Kramer has 
assembled hi s lads in the Big 
Apple this week for the NCAA 
Division III National 
Championships being held at 
the State University of New 
York in Albany. Since 7 am

Running Thoughts 

By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 
Slaff Writers 

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Talk about an 
explosive lineup. Don't confuse this year's American League All · 
Star lineup with that of the California Angels. The Angel lineup 
better. Two years ago Hobby Gnch became the IIrS[ secona 
baseman in over 80 years to lead the league in homeruns. Healso 
has the highest career fielding percentage for his position in 
history. He's hitting over .300 this year. Tim Foli was the 
toughest man to strike out in the majors last year. He's hitting 
.330 this eason . Third baseman Doug DeCinces is hitting .325 
and leads the league in homeruns with nine. Eight time All Star 
center fielder Fred Lynn is second in the league in both home 
runs and RBI's . First baseman Rod Carew is leading the universe 
in hitting with a .485 average. The Angels have been lacking a 
good hitting hort top since the Jim Fregosi era. All Star Rick 
Burle on i injured again this year so they stuck little·known 
Juan Beniquez in the hole this year. His contribution! A .415 
average. Bench strength? Rookie Daryl Sconiers has come off the 
bench to crack four homerun and hit at a .379c1ip. And how can 
you leave out Reggie Jackson? The sad side of the story? A 
potential dyna ty is dimini hed to merely a contender with a 
weak pitching staff. The team' earned run average thus far is a 
di mal 4 .55. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. During a recent NBC ba eball 
telecast, a nnouncer Joe Garagiola, a former Cardinal catcher, 
bragged about the fact that hi s St. Louis jersey number 17 has 
been retired . How can this be? Garagiola was a .220 lifetime 
hitter who spent much of his career sitting on the pine. Thl.! 
answer is simple: it turns out that pitching great Dizzy Dean also 
wore number 17 for the Cardinals. 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. The Milwaukee Bucks 
dispo ed of the Bo ton Celtic tradition in four straight games (as 
we told you they would) to advance to the Ea tern Conference 
final s to take a shot at the PHiladelphia 76ers. They better do a 
lot of praying when they shoot. The 76er are banged up but it 
doesn't matter. Ph illy in five . 
QUOTES EXTRAORDINAIRE DEPT. Said Ron Jaworski 
of the Philadelphia Eagles on rumor that he might be traded to 
the Buffalo Bill, "My moth er st3rts those rumors. I think she 
want me back home."

Head Coach Ly le Yates 
reflected: "We had a ll th e

game. We started out with a 
bang . We outhi t them. 
Jankows ki made wizard plays 
at third . But the little things in 
the s ixth and seventh ... and 
that's the ballgame." 

The Scene of the Rec. 

The unlu c k y seve nth 
marked the Triton dow nfall. 
The leadoff hitler bunted 
safely for a hit . Westmont 
decid ed to pla y it sa fe and 
scra tch fo r one score wi th a 
sacrifi ce. Better sa fe than 
a n xious. They ended up 
getti ng four. A sacrifice bunt 
was thrown to second base in 
a n attempt to cu t down the 
lead runner. ot in time. Safe. 
The next hitler la id down a 
sacrif ice a long t he firs t base 
line but Kum mer dropped the 
ball. Everybody's safe. Bases 
loaded. none out. Westmont 
put c1cm n a ~queeze bunt up 
the tlmd base li ne. Dave 
Jankow'ikl fielded it cleanl y 
but the t hro\\ home hit the 
runner in the back and 
bound('d away allO\\ing t\\O 
run, to smre. A ground ball to 
second brought home thl,thlrd 
run of the Inning and a "mgle 
up the mIddle capped the 
Inlllng by giving Westmont a 
7':~ lead.

but th e preparation begins 
today in t he form of an 
ex te nsive weight training

Men in Nationals 
continue d from page 13 
game, but of playoff action by 
altering the schedule of team 
practice last week. "We 
practiced early in the 
mornings (6 to 8 am) to get 
adju ted to the time change. I 
want my player to be at ea e 
come playoff time." The 
Triton coach apparently ha 
accomplished what he set out 
to do, a the mood on the quad 
was one of excitement and 
anticipation when the team 
boarded a flight to New York 
ea rly aturday morning. 

Although winning the team 
championship would eem to 
be the school's number one 
priority, the la t four day of 
tournament play are desig-
nated for the indi vidual 
si ngles and double. champion-
_hips, events UCSD should 
fare pretty well in if Kramer 
receive superlative play from 
at least one of his prime 
contenders. Dave ider, 
currentlv ra nked fifth in the 
country: IS UCSD's be t bet for 
a first place finish. "Dave 
gained some valuab l e 
experience at last J ear's 
tourney, and nght no v IS 
perform1l1g very well for us," 
said Kramer. 

expect bIg things from him not 
on ly in New York but next 
year as well." 

A player of mystery for 
UCSD this ea on i another 
San Diego native, Lance 
Lareau. Lareau, who Kramer 

Th e UCSD Guardian 

calls "the most talented player 
on the team," has been 
sporadic . At times Lareau has 
demonstrated the capability of 
playing awesome tennis. At 
just as many other time his 
play has been sub-par, leaving 
doubt in the minds of UCSD 
follower about his position as 
the country's 23rd best player. 

Behind ider i" the nation's 
12th-ranked player, Eugene 
jones. The jUl110r from San 
DIego \\ as the Trttons' 
number one player 111 the ea rly 
part of the "eason, but 
inconSIstency and naggmg 
1I1]unes caused his perform-
ance to suffer. "Eugene has all 
the toob and was instrumen-
tal in the team's succes!, th IS 
}ear," <;ay<; Kramer. "We 

Nadine Akimoto shouldl"t be too surprised at her team's # 1 
rating_ Both men'!. and women's teams compete at Nationals.

Rounding out the Triton <;' 
tournament scorecard, jones 
and Lareau will team up for 
doubl s, while jon Hammer-
meister , a junior from 
Puyallap who was be et with 
injuries this year, will pair 
with Sider on the wide court. 

Facing the be. t teams in the 
nation in a pressure-packed 
tournament and expecting a 
national championship might 
be asking too much of UCSD, 
but Kramer does not try to 
hide the fact that he will be 
disappointed if the Tritons 
come back empty-handed . "r 
know the whole team wants to 
win it very badly. We're not 
going all the way back to New 
York to finish in third place."

Pads 3 -30n 
Homestand 
continued from pa~e ] 4 
after beg1l1ning the season by 
not allowing an earned run in 
three appearances, has turned 
it around. He lost his second 
game of the homestand by 
allowing eighth inning home-
runs to Leon Durham and Ron 
Cey - only Cey's second 
extra-base hit of the 'eason -
to essentially end the contest. 

Facing the possibilit y of an 
embarrassing sweep to the 
Cubs at home, 'an Diego 
rebounded behind Dave Dra-
\'ecky (now 5- 1) for a 5-3 
victory before another 50,000 
crowd (t he Beach Boys had 
sorneth1l1g todo\ ith that). It 
wasn't t he best game Dra-
vecky's pitched, but it was 
good enough as the 'ophomore 
went the full nine innings for 
the fourth time this season, 
tops in the that department in 
the majors. 

The story. 0 far has been 
1I1consistency. The relief corps 
IS a collecti\'e 0-7 (actually, 
that is consIstency, but in the 
\vrong direction). The defense 
has been on and off. The 
offen<;e ha<; come through 
some limes, sparked by Ken 
nrd} (leading the league in 
HBIsl and juan Bonilla (Iead-
mg the league in hits), but has 
fizzled at others, \\ith the team 
I<.'ading the world in hitting 
ll1to doublt'plays. If the Padre',> 
hope to catch Atlanta and Los 
Angeles, both plaving out-
stancl!ng ball lately, they \\ ill 

ha\(~ to become consistent. 
Consistent Iy con..,istent , espe-
CIally 111 the bullpen. And 
consistently better.
