Draft May Return, 
Lo(;>byist Cautions 
Volunteer Army Enlistment Short, 
Result May Cut College Deferment 

By Jeff Keresford-Howe 
A sociate Managing Editor 

DA VIS - A wider, more 
inclusive military draft is being 
seriously considered by 
Congress , the legislative 
director for the United Stales 
Students Association said at a 
legislative conference here 
Saturday. 

Joel Packer, director of the 
Washington-based lobby, told 
the approximately 125 students 
attending the conference from 
across the UC system that 
unhappiness with the volunteer 
army is -causing Congress to 

take a second look at the draft. 
"John Stennis (D-Miss), the 

chair of the Senate Armed 
Service Committee, has come 
out in favor of the draft, and 
member of Congress are 
giving it serious study. The 
volunteer army is regarded a 
a failure ," Packer said. 

The House Armed Services 
Committee has held a day oC 
hearing on resuming the draft, 
he added. 

Can_didates Battle For OM Post 
" The Pentagon , just 

coincidentally, has relea ed a 
rcport showing that for the first 
time in five years the army has 
failed to reach its enlistment 
quotas ," P acker al 0 aid. 

Packer says the po ibilityof 
a draft i gaining support 
rapidly in Washington. " Just a 
month ago, when the USSA 
board met in January, we 
didn 't con ider it a erious 
issue, one we would have to 

Denyes Claims JaCoby Substitutes Mudslinging for Issues 
ByJOD GoeU. 

Senior Staff Writer 
Gordon Denyes , running 

against UCSD employee Pat 
JaCoby in tomorrow's special 
election for a one-year seat on 
the Del Mar city council, 
criticized JaCoby for her 
" negative" campaign against 
him in a forum at the Revelle 
Community Center last week. 

The two are battling for a post 
on the council left vacant after 

'a member resigned. The four 
remaining councilmen dead-
locked between Denyes and 
JaCoby on a vote for a 
replacement, so they sent the 
mandate to the Del Mar voters. 

JaCoby says she is cam-
paigning on the issue of alleged 
conflicts of interest involving 
property Denyes owns near 
sites involved in questions now 
before the city. She has also 
said, " I'm not running against 
Gordon per se... but I am 
running against the special 
interest groups which have 
been publicly announced as 
supporting him -local realtors 
and Chamber of Commerce 
members," as quoted in a Feb. 
14 Guardian article. He objects 
to this . 

"She's wrong," said Denyes. 
"When the council was voting 
on the replacement a guy stood

up and said that the Chamber 
and realtors were supporting 
me." Since the meeting the 
Chamber of Commerce has 
pointed out that they cannot 
endorse anyone, and the 
realtors never did g~t involved 
in the campaign. 

A second point of disagree-
ment was over a JaCoby 
criticism of Denyes , also 
printed in the article, saying he 
supports an unlimited number 
of apartment conversions to 
condominiums, which she says 
might take away inexpensive 
housing from some of the 500 
UCSD students living in Del 
Mar. 

Denyes, however, favor the 
present moratorium on such 
conver ions. He wa identified 
as a supporter oC the 
conversions following a 
meeting of the Planning 
Commi sion at which he 
suggested that propo ed 
legislation banning th move to 
condo was poorly drafted. 

A commissioner wrote a 
letter to the local newspaper 
sayinl D nye supported 
unlimited conver ion after 

that meeting , but Denyes 
traced the accusation to hi 
statement that the council 
might want to allow con-
versions for a specific purpose, 
such as low-income coops. 
Nevertfleless, since then he has 
been called a supporter. 

JaCoby says she can only 
quote the minutes (which 
Denyes claims misrepresent 
his comments). They say 
Denyes felt new construction 
and conversion should be 
allowed in all zones. 

While the campaign has 
produced a lot of clash between 
them, Denyes says he and his 
opponent take quite imilar 
stands on the is ues. Both h 
and JaCoby speak again t the 
proposed North City West , a 
40,()OO.person development to 
be built ea t of Del Mar. 
Similarly , neither ha any 
plans to alter the small town 
atmosphere of Del Mar. 

Ba lcally , however. the 
candidate hav imilar view 
on what the city needs. "The 
qu lion i ," ay ' D ny 
"who i better qualified?" 

pend a lot of time on. Now the 
whole i sue has mushroomed. " 

The lobby oPPO d the draft 
a " unneCJ y in pea e-
time, " but Packer said a draft 
is less likely than the "good 
chance" that Congress will 
require regl tration for the 
draft. 

If there is a draft, it would 
take a different form than the 
draft as we have known it, 
Packer told his audience. 

" President Carter was asked 
in Memphis at the Democratic 
mid-term convention whether 
college . tudents would be 
deferred from the draft. He 
aid no, " Packer said.

Things Go Better With (Legal) Coke 
In 1906. the last year of free. 

easy and legal cocaine 
distribution. Americans 
consumed twenty-one thousand 
pounds of pure cocaine at a 
price of two dollars and fifty 
cents per ounce. Now. in 1979. at 
a price of two thousand dollars 
per ounce and with some anti-
cocaine laws as severe as some 
anti-murder laws. Americans 

The author, a Muir freshman, 
w~shes to remain anonymous. 

will consume fifty thousand 
pounds of coke. Drug pro-
hibition does only two things: It 
makes dealing illicit drugs very 
profita ble and lowers the 
quality of the product available 
to consumers. It does not deter 
drug users from their 
recreation. 

A good dealer. if he treats his 
customers properly. reinvests 
all of his profits. has good 
business sense. is careful. and 
if he knows how to convince 
people of his knowledge and 
integrity. may rise a few steps 
up the pyramid of supply. 
buying ounces, quarter pounds 
and pounds . Finally he may 
become a mid-level dealer. 
buying kilos for firty thousand 
dollars and elling pounds, half 
pound. . quarter pounds and 
ounces. Now. his associates are 
businessmen making good 
money . not social acquain-
tances . He 's got two or three 
cars, a nice house and a fine 
stereo ystem. He's probably 
been in business for three or 
four years without misfortune. 
but most of the people he used to 
buy from have 'already been 
busted: that's how he got whe"e 
he is now. 

The mid-level dealer is in a 
crucial point in the cocaine 
cycle. He is in a dangerous 
position: at the top of a class of 
dealers. 

dealer intended to cut his kilo 
into four kilos. break it into 
grams and make four thousand 
individual sales! Ridiculous. Of 
course. there are several of his 
buyers who are just waiting to 
take his place. Availability 
Conditions: Snow as usual. 

The coca plant is grown in 

Bolivia and Peru. The leaves 
are tended to and harvested by 
people who worship the coca 
plant as a symbol of God's 
grace. They work diligently 
because they are stimulated by 
the gram and a half of cocaine 
per day which they derive from 
chewing the leaves while 

picking. The leaves are shipped 
to Colombia where they are 
refined to a brown paste. The 
final purification often takes 
place in Mexico. 

Mexicans and Colombians do 
not actively export the drug -
Americans must come and get 

(Please tum to paie lZ) 

If someone decides that he 
wants to buy some cocaine and 
get popular quickly. he's got to 
ask a friend who he's seen with 
the stuff to score fi ve or ten 
dollars worth for him. This is 
the lowest consumer level. He 
has no connections of his own. 
so his friend's doing him a 
favor. If he becomes a 
consistent buyer of quarter 
gram quantities or more. he 
will eventually meet the low. 
street-level dealer. because his 
peers know and are buying 
from this dealer. They will 
either meet at a party or at 
school or over the telephone via 
a personal referral. 

There are only two classes: 
dealers and DEALERS. The 
dealer's business is local and he 
is personally accessible to his 
buyers. The DEALER. on the 
other hand. has an interna-
tional business and he is 
buffered by scores of 
mediators. He has drivers and 
representatives . chemists. 
boats and planes. it seems that 
no one ever has contact with a 
DEALER . DEALERS sel-
domly get busted. maybe 
never. So. the mid-level dealer 
is a scapegoat. The police and 
the FBI can get to him. They 
crawl through the levels of 
distribution. starting at the 
bottom. using careful inves-
tigative techniques and 
abundant coercion. and when 
they reach the mid-level 
dealer, they bust him because 
they can go no further . 

Letters to the Editor 
Vending Issue Explained 

Editor: 
C'mon. who cares about the 

assumed "smoking contro-
versy in the A.S .... instead let's 
get the vending issue straight: 

The dealer is probably 
eighteen or nineteen years old. 
His money comes from 
marijuana sales because his 
cocaine profits usually end up 
in his nose. He buys seven or 
fourteen grams at a time. When 
he gets it. it has already been 
adulterated or "cut'· to expand 
its weight and volume. If he's a 
good dealer. he'll know just how 
much it has been cut and what 
with. If he's a bad dealer, he 
will not test his product at all 
and he might cut it again before 
he sells it. By the time it 
reaches the user it is only 
thirty-five or forty percent 
pure. The bad dealer makes 
money at first, but he will 
eventually lose customers and 
gain a bad reputation. 

When the police catch a mid-
level dealer with a kilo of 
cocaine which was purchased 
for fifty thousand dollars, they 
quote market prices of four 
hundred thousand dollars so 
~hat the arrest appears to be a 
big bust. To obtain this figure, 
they must allsume that the 

Jenkel's proposal. offered by 
Vice-Chancellor of Financial 
Management H.D. Johnson. 
entails a 25% share of vending 
commissions (about $12.4761 
year) for approximately five 
years. until the present 
accumulated Housing and Food 
Service deficit is paid. (which is 
well over last year's accumu-
lated $232.000 deficit, con-
Sidering that $120,000 of it was 
created last year alone) . After 
five years, colleges would 
receive 50% of the com-
missions . The proposa I 
a sumes an extra $20.000 from 
Reg Fees, totaling around 
$6500/year per college and

New Carter Proposals May 
Break Mid-East Stalemate 

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Carter, in a 
fresh effort to salvage Mideast peace prospects. 
gavc Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin 
new proposals yesterday. 

hoped to have a re ponse before he leaves the 
United States this week. 

The proposals were described by an Israeli 
official as " important and interesting." The 
contents were kept secret. but Sen. Jacob K. 
Javits. R-N.Y., told reporters after a meeting 
with the president that the proposals were in the 
nature of "pragmatic guarantees" designed to 
build trust between Egypt and Israel. 

Meanwhile. as White House statement aid 
Carter would review the situation with Egyptian '

It was the fir t positive development ince 
Begin arrived here Thursday. At the lime, Begin 
described the negotiations as in deep crisis. " It may be the cement that binds this treaty," 

Javits said. He refused to provide further 
details . 

Begin referred the proposals to his 
government in Jerusalem and told Carter he 

"The proposals are important because. in our 
estimation. they are different from previous

In a win that took a long time 

in coming, themen's volleyball 
team evened their season 
league record at 2-2 by beating 
La Verne last Friday night , 3-1. 

The Tritons, unthreatened 
during the first two games of 
the match, were "in command 
the whole time," according to 
Coach Doug Dannevik. The 
men started the first game out 
strong, winning 15-9. 

The second game, a 17-15 
decision for the visiting UCSD 
squad, was not nearly as close 
as the score indicates. " We 
never Celt that we were in u 
position to lose it," Dannevik 
commented. "Our guys were 
able to spread La Verne 's 
blockers out so we could face 
them one on one, which is 
exactly what we wanted to do." 

Using all substitutes in the 
third game , the Tritons 
dropped the contest. 4-15 . 
Nonetheless , they came back 
strong in the fourth , 15-13 , to 
win the match. 

Chris Wugner, a 5 ' 9 " 
Creshman, wus the new face in 
the starting lineup for the 
Tritons . "Ch ris is playi ng 
because he is reully hustling 
and helping out the team," said 
Dunnevik. 

Hal Jacobs and John Mooney 
continued to add their steady 
defensive Corces to the Triton 
teum effort . Starters Steve 
Upp und John Lee , both 
" excellent setter ," are the 
teum's most co n sistent 
pluyers. 

The te<lm ran into some bad 
officiating Friday night, and 
not for the fi rst ti me this 
seu on , The orficiuls at La 
Verne " thought we were 
playing under different rules ," 
SOlid Dannevik. " It was really 
shubby officiating with a lot of 
bad calls. I'm convinced '!lie 
have the best officials right 
here in San Diego. 

Bud officiating or not. the 
Tritons will have a tough job on 
their hunds a they take on San

Trying to avenge an earlier 
season loss to the nationally-
ranked Aztecs, Dannevik is 
looki ng Cor his team to play well 
in front of a home crowd. 

The week 's big game, as far 
as league play is concerned, 
will take place Saturday night 
at home against Pomona . 
UCSD dropped a match to 
Pomona during their first 
meeting of the season, but is 
looking for a win to put them in 
solid league position. " If we can 
beat Pomona at home," said 
Dannevik, "then realistically, 
we could finish at least second 
in our league."

Robertson's Arm Not Enough: Outfielder Bringle Pitches One Game 
• 

• PREGNANCY 
SCREENING -

By Jon Halperin . 
With less than half the 1979 

season completed, the UCSD 
Triton baseball team has 
surpassed the win total of the 
two previous year's teams. The 
Tritons won two and lost two in 
weekend action against 
Pomona Pitzer and Azusa 
Pacific. Steve Robertson got 
decisions in three of the 
contests, winning two and 
losing one. 

UCSD 10, Pomona Pilzer 8 
Dave Bringle, normally an 

outfielder, started the game for 
the Tritons pitching five strong 
innings. He held Pomona to one 
run over the first four innings 
and then gave up four runs in 
the fifth . 

Eric Zimmer was called upon 
next, only to give up three more 
runs. Pitching ace Robertson 
took over and responded by 
getting the next four men out in 
order to pick up the win. 

Offensively, Bret Sandstrom 
continued his hot hitting by 
going two for four: John 
Dickenson was the game's 
offensive star, blasting a 
double to left to drive in the 
winning runs. First baseman 
Bob Allen also had a good day , 
going three for three with two 
runs batted in .

In the second game, the 

Tritons needed some last 
minute heroics by Marc Sharp 
to complete the sweep. 

With two outs and the score 
tied at five all, Sharp hit a bloop 
single to score Dean Scarafoni 
from third base. 

Azusa Pacific 8, UCSD 1 
Steve Robertson sta rted 

Saturday'S lame for the 
Tritons and 

his five-inning stint. Again it 
was the barrage of costly errors 
leading to the UCSD downfall. 

The lone run came in the first 
inning as Eric Zimmer singled 
home John Dickenson. Pat 
McGovern showed signs of last 
year's offensive spark as he 
went two for four against a 
tough Azusa Pacific battery. 
Dean ScaraConi also hit well, 

two for two. 

Azusa Pacific 6, UCSD 1 
In the second I!ame, Tom 

Nicholson pitched . well only to 
lose on ao error by Bob Vaage 
in the eighth inning, allowing 
the Cougars to score. 

The Tritons opened the 
scoring as Marc Sharp. scored 
on a ground ball by Pat 
McGovern. TheCougars scored 
two in the third as the game 
developed into a classic 
pitcher's duel. ichol on wa 
on the top of his game with his 
offspeed pitches causing more 
that one Azusa P acific baUer to 
talk to himself in disbelief.

Denver and Reed: Exploiters of Image 

Tuesday. March 6 
11 :50 am 
Revelle Plaza 

John Denver, John Denve r 
(RCA) a nd 
Lou R e ed, Take No Prisoners 
(Arista) 

By Barry Alfonso 
The idea of d iscussing John 

Denver and Lou Reed in t he 
l>3 me review at first seems as 
a bsurd as comparing the 
relative merits of Lassie Come 
Home and T axi Driver . But 
bear with me. Both Denver and 
Reed are expert exploiters of 
their public images, per-
formers who have sustained 
long career by standing for 
distinct principles and 
lifestyles , giving people 
something to identify with . 
Denver's world is one of clear 
moun tain st reams , old -
fashioned love by the 
hearths ide, Grandma's feather 
bed. Reed brings to mind filthy 
coldwater flats, sadism, bad 
smack. On their latest albums 
each tries to live up to the 
expectations of his fans. 

John De n ve r finds the 
Choirboy of the Rockies adding 
a bit more energy to his sound, 
though the usual yearning love 
songs dominate the album, 
" Downhill Stuff" a nd hi s 
version of "Johnny B. Goode" 
are competent if mild rock 
numbers, Syrup i s still 
.Denver's standby, however -
" Wha t 's On Your Mind" a nd 
" You ' re So Beautiful " are 

. obviously designed to moisten

the eyes of his fa ithful. For 
those fa ns hungry fo r new 
nuggets of De nver wisdom, 
the re's " Life Is So Good" : 

Life is so good 
Life is so good these days 
U fe is so good these days 
Life is so good 

Denver reassu res , comforts, 
soothes. That 's what people buy 
his records for . 

"I never said I was tasteful ," 
Lou Reed remarks on Take No 
P r isoner s , recorded live in 
concert last spring, Self-
restraint is the last thing his 
devotees want. If Denver's 
latestlp upholds his tradition of 
good vibes , Take No Prisoners 
shows Reed wallowing in his 
foul -mouthed punk image as 
never before. This a lbum is 
almost annoyingly intimate, 
taken up asmuch by a rambling 
Lenny Bruce-style monologue 
as by perform ances of s uc h 
Reed standards as "Sweet 
Jane" and "Walk On The Wild 
Side." He inte r rupts his set to 
discourse on politics (" Give me 
an issue and I'll give you a 
tissue .. ,Wipe my ass"), New 
York rock critics ("Why don 't 
we shoot those journalists? ">' 
co metic brea t surgery, the 
price of laudanum and other 
topics of interest before the 
yowling crowd , Reed is fully 
awa re that he 's exploiting the 
sy mbol of decadence he 's made 
himself into over the years: 
" Watch me turn into Lou Reed 
before your very eyes," he tells 
his audience. " I do Lou Reed 
better than anybody ." If he 
panders, at least he's a master 
at it. 

De nve r , of course , can't 
ap pear as blata nt in pleasi ng 
his public - s incerity is his 
trademark , He de live rs his 
homili es without a trace of self-
mockery (" Look to the sun," he 
instructs us, " for our Father is 
with usl Our Mother will teach 
us l What we need to lea rn . ") 
The cha racters in his ongs (the

sweethear ts) are he ld up as 
e xa mples of t he Good Folk that 
populate our land , Even the 
more upbeat tunes on John 
Denver seem to be performed 
with a sense of duty. Denver 
offers suc h profund ities as 
"Pla nt your r ows stra ight and 
long/ Temper them with prayer 
and song" i n warm sermonly 
tones , a si nging she pherd 
lendi ng guida nce to his flock. 

Reed's relationship with his 
fans is a lmost the reverse -
rather than give them advice, 
he humiliates and degrades 
himself for their enjoyment. He 
has no mora l strength to offer, 
only an a bsolute lack of shame. 
In " I Wanna Be Black," quite 
possibly the most offensive 
rock song ever recorded, Reed 
a ppeals to the worst attitudes of 
his audience (' ' I don' t wa nna be 
no fucked-up Jewish middle-
class college student anymorel 
I just wanna have myself a 
sta ble of foxy little w horesl 1 
wanna be black ...... ) What 
makes Reed 's ugly swipes at 
others tolerable is his own 
vulnerability; in weepy ballads 
s uch as " Pale Blue Eyes" he 
e xpo es himself as totally 
wretched, a victim of hopeless 
love: " I thought of you as 
everything I hadl And ju t 
couldn ' t keepl .... Linger on, 
pale blue eyes ," Take No 
Prisoners presents Reed in all 
his contra dictions a nd excesses 
- like much of his work it' s 
both repulsive and touching, 
capturing the morbid charisma 
of the acknowledged king of 
Rock 'n ' Roll Self-Abuse . 

John Denver and Take No 
Prisoners both plow little new 
ground , but hould please 
longtime Denver a nd Reed 
Enthusiasts. In thi na tion of 
diversity , it seem s very 
American th a t these two vastly 
different songwriters continue 
to release a lbums. Denver's 
tunes are s uger-coated; Reed 's 
a re dirt-enc l'usted, You buy 
your records a nd you take your 
choice .

Two weeks ago UCSD 
sophomore John Parker 
discovered that a gay magazine 
published eight pages of nude 

photographs of himself without 
his prior consent or knowledge. 

Because his "dignity has 
been taken a chip at," Parker 
plans to sue the magazine and

sold them the photographs.

By John Hondros 
Associate News Edhor 

The search for the perfect 
Bunny is on at UCSD. 

"Charlie" Foote, a pro-
fessional photographer 
residing in La Jolla, was 
recently hired by Playboy 
magazine to photograph local 
women who may "qualify" for 
the centerfold. If a woman is 
selected by Playboy she will 
receive a $10,009 fee, while 
Foote will get $1,000 for his 
services. 

Foote placed an ad on the 
centerfold search in . The 
Guardian last week and so far 
has had six responses , although 
one woman " changed her 
mind" upon di covering she 
would have to pose topless in 
one stili. "Can you imagine a 
girl who wants to pose for a 
centerfold and doesn 't want to 
do the econd (topless) pose ?" 
commented Foote. 

According to Foote , four 
photos are taken of each 
qualifier at Scripps Park in La 
Jolla : The first po e is a 
" bikini" hot , the econd is 
"bikini bottom only , " the third , 
a " fully-clothed" shot and the 
fourth is a "braless under 
sweater" hot. 

Linda Rufer, a work-study 
member of the Women ' s 
Center, believes that maga-
zines such as Playboy are " an 
exploitation of women, whether 
promoting on college campuses 
or other places ." 

In order to be qualified for the 
centerfold, the woman must be 
between 18 and 24 years of age, 
and have" a beautiful face and 
a beautiful body ," said Foote .

it. In California, the smugglers 
are either individual dealers or, 
more fre-'uently , hired by big 
dealers . Californian dis!: 
tributors are still somewhat 
competitive so they sell uncut 
cocaine to mid-level dealers at 
relatively low prices. Else-
where in the country, forty

turned it into a monopoly. The

the usen . At opposite ends of 
this twu-way street, anti -

level ealers in small 
quantities and drug users 
consume the cocaine in large 
quantities. The beneficiaries of 
this cycle are Bolivians , 
Peruvians , Mexicans, big 
suppliers and U.S. Government 
agencie . What v r happened

Women who pose nude for

themselves ; Playboy is just a 
vehicle for doing it," according 
to Rufer. She said that· 'it is just 
as sick" when a man poses nude 
for a centerfold.

At the same time, according pending filing of a lawsuit

Rufer explained that women 

pose for business purposes. 
" They want the money ... and 
want the publicity , and 
probably feel this is the best 
way to do it." 

Russia Uninterested in War 
In terms of popularity , 

Playboy and Penthouse 
magazines are running side-by-
side, yet are outranked by 
Hustler a nd Playgirl , ac-
cording to Foote. "I find it 
surprising that more women 
want to look at naked men, than 
men want to look at naked 
women. I would think the 
oppo ite," he said. 

Added Foote, " If I were a girl 
I wouldn't po e, unless I was 
hard up. "

If it were up to the 30 visitors 
from the Soviet Union · at a 
Wednesday reception in the 
Revelle Formal Lounge, 
President Carter would not 
have to worry about Russia 
going to war. 

The group echoed the 
sentiments of one engineer that 
Russia and the United States 
should be friends and pool their 
technological resource , rather 
than using them against each 
other.

Revelle Plaz. sponsored by 

Campus Crusade for Christ 

of the National AlliAnce against 
Racist and Political Repression 
and the Society for US-Soviet 
Friendship, provided an 
opportunity for UCSD students 
and professors to meet and talk 
with a cross-section of the 
Soviet society , including 
engineers, students, workers 
and teachers. 

Another engineer, while 
admitting that the China-
Vietnam situation is grave, 
said that he does " not think 
China and (the) Soviet Union 
will fight over Vietnam. II He 
went on to say that his country 
has had nothing to do with the 

conflict between China and 
Vietnam and that the Soviets 
would like the situation to come 
to an end. 

According to many of the 
Soviet students at the 
reception, Russia's youth do 
not look to war as a means of 
solving any problems. In 
accordance with this is their 
stand that the "SALT 
agreements must be now." 

In response to a query about 
Brezhnev ' health, one 
engineer replied that " He is an 
old man, but I think he i not 
dying. "
