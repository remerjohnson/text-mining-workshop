. AS Store .eNot . Getting 
Survey Endorsement 

By Riaa Lee Podolsky 
Staff Writer 

A proposed AS Student Center store i!> creating controversy 
among some students who think-the campus already has enough 
general stores. . 

The store was first approved by the AS Nov. 19. The inventory 
list, which originally included coke spoons, squirt guns and Perrier 
water, was the subject of a squabble between AS President 
Carlos Montalvo and the AS Council. 

In the meantime, the Student Center Board, which has 
allocated the space formerly occupied by The Daily Guardian to 
be used for an AS store, distributed a survey to students asking 
them to indicate their preferences for items they would wish to see 
in the store. 

200 surveys have been tabulated, and a canvas of some of 
them show that the most preferred item is records, with school 
supplies and sundry items close behind. 

About one-third of the surveys showed some sort of 
dissatisfaction with the store. A large number of students had 
suggested items not listed on the survey (such as liquor store, or 
hair salon), and "about 30% of the one-third" were against the 
idea of a student store at ~1. Several people wrote on the survey 
sheet, "no more stores." . . 

Kessler commented, "Considering that there waliJ no space 
provided in the survey to express the opinion of not having an AS . 
tore, it's very significant that 10% of thOde surveyed took the 

trouble to write that in. 
"If the AS feels they need more money to provide services to dll 

the students, and the students feel they do indeed need morl' 
lerivce , then the AS would be justified in needing more money. 
However, if the AS decided tu generate more reVt'nuc for

Mexican Gov't · Says It 
Doesn't Want 'Shah Back 

WASHINGTON (AP) - us officials, 
surprised by Mexico's decision yesterday not to 
readmit the deposed Shah of Iran, were trying 
last night to assess the impact of the move. 

State Department officials said it was not 
clear from the terse statement issued by 
Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castenada 
what Mexico had done or what the import of the 
action might be. 

Casten ada said "the government of Mexico 
will not be in a po!>ition to renew" the shah" visa 
"becau!>e it would make no sense for him to 
return to Mexico." 

Carter administration officials, speaking 
privately , said the Mexican decision was a 
surpnse. _ 

Moslem militants holding the US Embas y 
said yesterday a trial of American hostages 
would be "inevitable" if the deposed shah is 
allowed to leave the United States for Mexico 
instead of Iran. 

A spokesman said a trial could begin "very 
soon" and hinted the fifty hostages also might 
be mistreated. 

The Italian news agency Ansa reported that 
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told a group 
of European reporters he intends to put 
President Carter on trial after trying the shah. 

The ' spokesman said later that the shah's 
dpearture would be "the worst thing the United 
States can do. It may be a case of the trial 
beginning very soon." The militants have never 
set a date for such a trial. 

He added, "We will change our policy 
toward the hostages. We have repect for them, 
friendly relations, because our religion is Islam. 
We will change our policy._ .The reaction of the 
Iranian people will be such that it brings a great 
loss to the United States." 

As has been customary, the young man did 
not give his name. . 

Legal and financial manuevering dominated 
news in the Iranian crisis yesterday. 

-IRAN'S BANKS are turning over 
financial record!> to a government investigating 
team seeking evidence to support the 
Ayatollah 's accusation that the l>hah and his 
family diverted billions of dollars in public funds 
for their oWll"use. 

The investigation it. being presented by 
officials of Iran's Central Bank under the 
leadership of the bank's new Governor, Ali.

Mexican Studies 'Center' 
Cut Down to 'Program' 

By Taylor Dark 
Concern that correct procedures be used in 

the development of academic programs has 
resulted .in a minor controversy and some 
changes in a proposed United State!>-Mexico 
Studies Center that was to have been 
established at UCSD this spring. 

Dr. Wayne Corpelius, one of the country's 
foremost experts on Mexican migration 
patterns, will still come to UCSD in the spring 
from the Massachuselt!> Institute of 
Technology, but not as the head of an official 
center. Instead, he will be working within the 
Political Science Department on an individual 
project. 

Cornelius' efforts still await final approval 
from the faculty Cornmittee on Educational 
Policy, according to Sanford Lakoff, 
department chairman. Lakoff feels the CEP will 
approve the program as part of the Political 
Science Department. -

The center was planned in September, and 
university source!> say appropriate faculty 
members should have been consulted about the 
center at that time. Instead, according to Dr. 

Aaron Cicourel, chairman of "the Academic 
Senate, he did not hear of the center until he 
read about it in The Daily Guardian in late 
September. -

Those involved with the Center for Iberian 
and 'Latin American Studies also ay they were 
not con:;ulted. Questions have been raised as to 
whether Cornelius' center would overlap the 
existing center's activities. It is not known what 
kind of cooperation, if any. would occur 
between CILAS and the US-Mexican Center. 

Because of a feeling of a lack of widel>pread 
faculty consultation, the center wal> changed to 
the less rigid status of a departmental program . 

"Cornelius wa!> happy to go along with the 
change," according to Chancellor William 
McfJrOY· 

Cicourel said his concern in the matter was 
that "the proper procedures be followed. That is 
my obligation al> leader of the Academic 
Senate." Cicourel emphasized that he "was not 
in opposition to the program." A recent Los 
Angeles Times article said he is in "serious 
opposition" to the center. He called it "bad

Editor: 
I am pleased that The Daily Guardian has .developed 

IiUfficient interest in student affirmative action at UCSD to 
comment editorially on the matter. However, I must take 
exception to the implications of your (Nov. 20) editorial that 
Third College and I take lightly the difficulties associated with 
recruiting and retaining minority students at UCSD and that we 
have not given sufficient attention to the need to recruit and 
enroll qualified minority students. 

The issue Third College has conlitantly raised for almost a 
decade now is that the recruitment 01 minority students to UCSD 
has not been a priority of the rest of the campus and has not been 
given the seriOUli attention it deservell .. particularly in terms of 
the proper matching of the academic preparation, expectations, 
understandings and interests of minority litudents and the 
curriculum available at UCSD. 

Third College has-continuolily striven, in a variety 01 ways, to 
achieve such a better match. The development of the writing 
program. and the Mathematics 4 and 6 lequences repreaent 
Third College initiative. in this relipectthat have been extended 
to all four colleges. Similarly, we have always advocated 
minimum criteria for .pecial action admilisions and were the firs. 
to set IUch criteria at UCSD. We have' annually presented these 
criteria for scrutiny by both the faculty and administration with 
the explicit underlitanding that we would accept any proposals 
to make the criteria more stringent. The reliult has been not only 
the endorsement of our criteria by all reviewer~ but also their 
adoption as the general standard f~r special admissions- to all 
four colleges. 

Of greater imporlance are the efforlll Third College has 
undertaken to improve the level of academic preparation of 
potential minority students. We are one of the first to do a 
systematic study of the causes of UC ineligibility among minority 
students. As a result, our data and recommendations formed a 
substantial part of the System·wide University of California 
Student Affirmative Action plan and ~rved as the information 
balie for the efforts of a number of community organizations and 
governmental agencies, including at least one school district, to 
increalle minority student preparation for college. 

Our brochure, Parents Protect Your Children's Fulure: Haoe 
Them Take Algebra and Geometry (printed in English and 
Spanillh), has been adopted by the University of California 
systemwide, and is distributed to every student contacted by the 
statewide Partnership Program .. well over 6,000 brochures a 
month. Thi~ Third College.developed brochure, which ha~ been 
decribed as one of the most creative approache~ to improving 
the academic preparation of students, has been utilized in 
secondary schools in more than two dozen states. 

Our complaints and requests for the enrollment of more 
reasonable numbers of minority students in Third College (and 
UCSO as a whole) have always been baaed on a detailed 
analYllis ol the pool of available minority students, their 
anticipated levels of academic preparation and the demand!! of 
the UCSD curriculum. Our request!> have always been 
reasonable and modest , have always been open to detailed 
scrutiny and discussion, and have never been found wanting in 
either propriety or feasibility . 

Because we have had a good understanding of the 
complexities of recruiting and retaining minority !ttudents at 
UCSD, our requests for increased recraitment of minority 
students have always been accompanied by an ex licit

willingne~s to work cooperatively with others . For example , for 
at least four years we have proposed that substantial 
improvement in the recruitment of minority students to UCSD 
could be achieved if information was given to predominantly 
minority high schools on what courses and course cont~nts 

provid~ the best' preparation for UCSD. We further ~ro~sed · 
that this inlormation would be most effectivdy utilized if it was 
not liimply given to counselors but presented to high school 
teachen. by their UCSD faculty counterparts. 

This proposal was tried on an experimental basis last spring 
quarter by Third College and several faculty members in 
conjunction with EOP. The initial resul!s were excellent and 
strongly indicated that this type of academic outreach effort to 
high schf -015 could substantially increase the number of 
academically well· prepared studenlli they send to UCSD. 

I hope that this partial liliting of Third College efforts to 
increase minority student enrollment provides a more accurate 
understaiading of our position and actiVities and helps to foculi 
discussion on the real issue and away from peraonalities and 
myth!!, ~g. , that the ' pool of qualified minority students iii 10 
small nothing can be done to increase immediately their numbers 
at UCSD to acceptable levels. The iuue is: does UCSD as an 
institution wish to have a reasonable repre~entation of minorities 
in its "tudent body? If the answer is yes, what is the propo~ . 
plan for achieving this institutional goal? Third College ha~ 
obviously answered these questions for itM!1f in the affirmative.

Sex Harassment Study 
Just Confirms Views 
Editor: 

After enduring a lengthy 
period of verbal antagonililTI 
concerning sexism withing the 
pagelt of your newspaper, I 
was surprised by your Nov. 23, 
article . "Sexual Harassment 
Surveyed Here." The article 
concerns Mary Lynn Hughes , 
visual arts graduate student, 
who is in the 'process of 
studying problems of sexual 
harassment as experienced by 
women at UCSD. My question 
concerning this valiant effort 
is, why does Ms. Hughes 
righteously presuppose that 
women are the only victims of 
sexual harassment in our 
society ? 

Her objectives are clear; to 
obtain dat a on Itexual 
harassmetl t to substantiate 
attitudes she has already 
Clearly delinea ted . By ign.oring 
the f1ip.side of the problem of 
sexua l hdTasltment, bhe has 
done more than comple tely 
debase her own study. She has 
indicted the milsculine gender 
for debau 'hery whi(h women 
"must be" inl'i1pilble of. 

I would ~uggest that Ms. 
Hu!(hes. hefore taking the 
results of her ~tudy illld "giving 
th m to tbt' publit'," take iI 

good look at whether she i~ 
trying to browbeat th,e public 
with a sexillt report for 
inherently sexist moti ... es.

A Problem,

Editor: 

Your article (Nov. 15) on 
the impact of Iranian oil loss 
contains at least one M!rious 
error and one serioub 
omis!>ion. 

I !>tated that spot prices for 
oil have been 50 percent to 
100 percent higher than 
OPEC price~ (i.e., $33 to $45 
per barrel). OPEC prices 
could not possibly be "50 to 
100 percent lower than prices 
on the spot ma rket ," unlebs 
some of the OPEC oil were 
now sent to us free of harge. 

The proper US response to 
urtailment of Ira nian oil 

imports is curtai lme nt of

lNhy Not the Best and the Brightest in '80? 
By Jonathan Grudin 
"Carter - Mondale." 

The gree n and white 
bumper sti cker had not 
changed much · a lillie fading 
some water and exhaust stains 
. in the almost four years it 
clung 10 the left rear corner of 
my oid Dodge. But its two· 
word message had shifted 
meaning. Loohing at ii, I 
remembered: Ihe war was 
over, Waterga le winding 
down . The promise of a fresh 
slarl. 

"Why not the best?" asked 
candida te Carter. He ~aid he 
would cut defense spending, 
withdraw our troops from 
Korea. Inflation would be held 
down, un e mplo y m e nt 
reduced. The Equal Rights 
Amendment would be pushed .

Jonathall Grudin is a UCSD 
graduale sludell t in psycho/.

The United States would no 
longer be arms merchant to 
the 'world, foreign govern· 
menlb would be accountable 
for their lack of respect of 
human right~. An outsider, 
owing nothing to Washington 
lobbyists a nd vested interests, 
could make positive changes . 

The best, unaccountably, 
all seemed to come from 
Georgia, a nd some turned out 
to be less than fine. Defen~e 
spending wa~ not cut ; soon we 
were committed to increases in 
military spending above the 
infla tion rate. We decided to 
keep troops in Korea. even al> 
our dic ta tor s tepped up 
politi ca l repressio n. The 
United States continued selling 
arms a t a dizzying rate, 
sometimes to both sides of a 
conflict, often to repressive 
governments whose main use 

of the weaponry was agains t 
its own people. Some of those 
weapon> in Iran may some 
day be turned on Americans, 
but when that market dried up, 
we opened o thers. And re~pec t 
for human right~ seemed 
i mporta n t In I n verse 
proportion to the influence of 
the country in question. 

The Equal Rights Amend· 
ment was a llowed to flounder. 
Infl a tion skyrocketed and 
unemployment rose. The 
candida te had promised to 
sign a bill revoking Taft· 
Hartley; the president actually 
invoked Taft.Hartley. Oil wa~ 
decontrolled before excess 
profit tax laws were passed, 
a llowing the oil companies to 
reap huge p,rofits which they 
have used , so fa r successfully , 
to fi ght excess profit taxes. 

And the hypocrisy! "Cuba 
i~ a Soviet puppe t," we 
claimed, yet continued an 
e mba rgo of Cuba while 

~tepping up trade with the 
USSR. " Human rights ,'1 we 
proclaimed, while shipping

Some Families Are That Close 
By John Hondros 

A friend of mine called from Berkeley 
Monday night. I told her I was g lad to hear from 
her and a ll. I rea lly didn't feel like talking, 
though. 

John Hondros is associate news edi tor of 
The Daily Guardian. 

. "So, how are you doing?" she a~ked. 
"Ehh - not so good," I replied, adding, "my 

grandfa ther passed a way this morning." 
"Oh, I'm sorry ." 
"Yeah , me too." 
"Did you know him?" 
Thi s question hit me oddly. Did I know him ? 

Of course I knew him - he was my 
grandfather, wa~n' t he? I a lways took that for 
granted , 

"Yes," I sort of a nswered : 
"Wha t I meant," ~he went on, "is that some 

, people don 't know their grandparents . You 

know, some people never meet them. Some 
families arell 't tha t close .... " 

Well, this brought to mind the things my 
grand mother has told me. She's always 
tressed the importance of gell ing married and 

raising kids a nd a ll. That 's what she feels life is 
a ll about. The family , you know. Being 
together, etc. 

But isn't that wha t it 's a ll about? You know, 
with the family? 

While my gra ndfa ther lay in the hospital bed, 
the family was there until the end. Someone was 
a lways there: to ta lk with him ; to feed him; to 
laugh with him; to c ry fo r him; to move him 
when he was uncomfortable; to be with him .... 

Well , I don 't know. Maybe I'm just writing 
this because I feel a ll down and insecure right 
now. Ma)'.be I shouldn 't even be writing at a ll. 

Hul, I've been thinking - I really want 
someone to be there when I get old.

Brown Va. BE 
Case Reopened 

TOPEKA, Kamas - The 
historical Brown vs. Board of 
Education case, which began 
here 28 years ago and led to 
the US Supreme Court's 1954 
ban on racial segregation in 

. schools, was reopened by a 
federal judge yesterday after a 
group of parenti complained 
schools are not yet integrated. 

US District Court Judge 
Richard Rogers ruled that a 
group of black parents who 
8liked him to revive the case 
have a continuing legal 
interest in seeing that the 
court's desegregation order is 
properly carried oul. 

Jail Rights 
To Court 

SAN FRANCISCO - The 
California Supreme Court 
agreed yesterday to consider a 
prosecutor'li challenge of an 
appeal court ruling which 
severely limits monitoring of 
conversations of people in jail . 
awaiting trial. . 

The petition asked the court 
to consider whether pretrial 
prisoners have a reasonable 
expectation of privacy when 
held in county jail and, if so, is 
the sheriff's duty to provide 
security and public safety 
sufficient to permit monitoring 
conversationli.

themselves ,?y opening a student store, then they are 
circumventing student input on the matter," Kessler said, 

ex~ning why he thought the survey was important. 
'No student besides AS officers has come forward to support 

thi. store," argues Jon Bekken, Student Welfare Commissioner, 
commenting that there was "no place on the survey to check 
l18ying 'Why another store?' 

"The AS wants more money, and they could raise the activity 
fee. but they'd have to rationalize that to students. This way they 
can just make money," Bekken said. 

Kenler said that AS store il> an enterprise, not a co·op, "and 
enterpriaes exist to make money. The AS will take the money the 
store makes and distribute it to student organizations. A co·op 
char,es the lowest possible prices and passes the sa ving~ on to the 
conaumer. " 

Brad Barham, AS Commissioner on Appointments and 
Evaluations, points out, though, that "it'" important 10 solicit

journalism." , 

He did say that as a member of CILAS he Iii 
interested in seeing cooperation between the 
two groups. 

"The real news here," says Lakoff, "is that 
we are setting up a program that may be one of 
the most important developments in the history 
of UCSD." , 

While acknowledging thai "some feathers 
were ruffled, perhaps justifiably, what is 
important is that we are developing what will be 
the belit Mexican Studies program in the 
country." 

Both Lakoff and McElroy feel that CILAS 
and the US· Mexican studies program will 
complement each other. CILAS "has dealt 
primarily with Spanish and South American 
studies, not with Mexico," McElroy said. 

Assistant Chancellor Pat Ledden believes 
that "none of this probably would have 
happened if Cornelius had been here to explain 
hi, position." 

Cornelius did make a visit to the campus in 
late October, but only after criticism had been 
voiced. 

Despite the storms before the formation of 
the program, Lakoff remains excited, proud 
and enthusiastic: about what he thinks Cornelius 
will bring to the campus . 

Cornelius, he says, is a "very productive, 
hardworking, skillful person" who will playa 
role in Lakoff's goal of "making UCSD's 
political science department" one of the be~t in 
the country ," 

Lakoff said that while the program would 
mainly center on research , the undergraduate 
population at UCSD would also benefit from 
four courses to be taught in the spring by 
Cornelius and his wife, Dr. Ann Craig, recently 
01 Clark University. 

The program has received an intial $30,000 
grant from McElroy, and applications have 
been made for grants from numerou~ private 
foundations and other groups.

Ideal Problem: Too Many Good Swimmers 
By Jon Goetz 
Sports Editor 

The men's swim coach has 
a problem this. year that most 
coaches would envy - he's 
got too many qualified 
athletes. 

Last March seven UCSD 
swimmers qualified for the 
National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics 
national championships. Next 
March coach Bill Morgan 
figures as many as 16 of his 
swimmers might go. That's 
especially noteworthy because 
three of the seven qualifiers 
aren't back this season. 

Joe Hernandez, the third 
place 200 free finisher in the 
1979 nationals, returns, as do 
All· American swimm.ers 
Lance Halsted and Mark 
Allen, and Jeff Bermett, who 
also competed in the meet. 

Jim Agronick, Nelson 
Howard and Greg McGary, 
who swam in the natiOlJals last 
season didn't come out for'lhe 
team this year. 

A crew of new and old 
swimmers will be replacing 
them, however, providi,,!g the 
team with depth in every event 
except the butterfly events. 

Chris Dixon, a senior 
transfer from San Diego State, 
has beaten the UCSD record 
in the 1 00 b~eaststroke race 
by three seconds, and finished 
a 200 breast five seconds 
faster than the school mark. In 
addition, his 200 individual 
medley time would have 
placed sixth in the NAJA 
nationals lalit March. 

Roger Kirton, a tall 
freshman from Saratoga, 
should qualify in the 200,500, 
and 1650 freestyle races . His 
previous times would have put 
hil)1 in the top 12 swimmers in 
each race at the national 
championships. 
. John Beckley, a transfer 

from Rockford College in 
Illinois, was an NAIA A 11-
American swimmer while 
competing for that school. He 
should easil make the 
standards for the 50, 100, and 
200 free. 

The most versatile 
newcomer is Bob Conlin, a 
water polo player who can 
swim the 50, 100, 200 and 
500 free races, and the 100 
and 200 backstroke. 

Three other water polo 
players, Tracy Strahl, Ed 
Profumo and Jim Senz, ·are 
also phYl>ically capable of 
meeting the national 
standards. 

A pair of swimmers from 
Pacific Lutheran College in 
Washington. Kevin Lingell 
and Steve Beal, both 
transferred to UCSD after a 
coaching change. Lingell is a 
middle distance freestyler, and 
Beal swims the fly events. 

Another strong distance 
freestyler comes from Eric 
Aylaian. 

"His potential is unlimited," 
says Morgan. "He's improved 
as much as anyone (during the 
fall workouts)."

Staff Writer 
Twenty-lour tennis players, from the AAA 

and AA brackets of intramural team tennis 
competition, battled it out under the Jtars on the 
Muir courts last night. The AAA championship 
was settled, and the two teams that will meet in 
the finals of the AA divi~ion were 'nearly 
determined . 

In the triple A 's, "Second to None" and "Add 
In" went at each other with the division title 
riding on the outcome. Second to None had 
moved up from third place in the "Babycakelo" 
league to make the linals, under the steady 
scoring 01 team members Tom Ahn, Steve 
Kigawa, Michel Gilbert , and Taryn Higashi. 
Add In was the only team from the "Nasty" 
league to ad vance past the quarterfinals 01 the 
championship ladder, but eventually took the 
AAA title . The team beat Second to None in 
men's'doubles, men's and women's singles, and 
the determining mixed doubles match. 

In coed team tennis, there are two men and 
two women on each team. All the players on a 
team compete in men's or women's doubles, 
then two 01 the players play men's and women's 
singles, while the other two pair up lor the final 
mixed doubles match. In any grouping, a team 
must win lour games to win a match, but it must 
win by two games, so play can sometimes l>eem 
to go on forever. 

Bert Royden, of the AAA champion Add In 
team, said his team "barely squeaked out" their

the captain of the Tomatoes, 
led the offensive drive. Her

Concert Promoters Notice San Diego 
Market Heating Up-Fans Get Benefit 

By Timothy Mackenzie 
The growth of " America's Finest City" has seen 

a corresponding increase in the rock concert 
business, with some different faces and rules 

, popping up over the past year. 
Historically , San Diego concerts have been the 

"afterbirth" of major rock tours; performers 
adding quickie shows here after finishing up the 
important L.A. showcase dates. Conversely, 
other performerb use San Diego as a test audience 
before facing the critics and trade papers in 
Hollywood. The geographIcal reality is that San 
Diego is in a corner. 

Over the past few years, though, San Diego has 
increased in importance as a concert town as. 

. promoters began to realize there was money, 
possibly big money, to be made here. And as in 
any struggle for a business market, there have 
been casualties. David Thayer and his California 
Concerts operation, as well as Moonlight 
Productions, are the most recent and notable. 
(Moonlight used to operate out of the La Paloma 
Theatre in Encinitas before taking the count 
downtown at the California Theater.) 

The battle for the local concert dollar now 
appears to be between Marc Berman Concerts, 
Larry Vallon Presents, Avalon Attractions and 
Wolf & Rissmiller Concerts . Avalon and Wolf & 
Rissmiller do the lion's share of promoting in Los 
Angeles, perhaps the premier concert market in 
the world, and have scheduled many of their 
"loyal" acts to additional concerts in San Diego. 

Recently, however, the local turf has been 
swinging over to Marc Berman's operation and to 
newcomer Larry Vallon. Berman has had a hand 
in almost every facet of the local market, from 
small shows at the Roxy Theatre in Pacific Beach 
to summer concerts at the SDSU amphitheatre to 
the large arena and stadium shows. Indeed, if 
anyone were to garner the title of "Mr. Concert" in 
San Diego, it would be Berman. 

Diego alone he brought the New Barbarians, 
James Taylor, Waylon Jennings, Little River 
Band, (and next week'" Fleetwood Mac) in 
concert since May. A~ a new operation, Vallon 
knew just how competitive the market would be. 
Speaking of the tight bailie for concert dollars, 
Vallon said "All you have to do is ldok at all the 
concerts coming up in San Diego." 

Vallon spoke of how bands develop "loyalties" 
with promoters; more often than not they keep 
their association on future tours. So how does a 
new promoter get his foot in the door? 

"Well, you have to get a good reputation to 
establish yourself" Vallon said. "In addition, as a 
new promoter I've got to develop new acts . I'm out 
at the clubs a I.ot scouting the stars of tomo"ow." 

Joanne Ward, head of Another Concert Nite 
(operating exclusively out of the Roxy), is one 
promoter who works with more than her share of 
new and developing acts. A lot of rock and new 
wave acts are showcased at the Roxy , hoping to 
get their big "break." Though she can't really 
compete for the big dollar operation!>, Ward is 
fortunate to have a venue completely at her 
disposal. When she does score a good act, like the 
recent Hall & Oates show there, the retiullb can I:>e 
very benefical to the audience. 

Concert promoters are a strange breed, for one 
night they may be bocializing together while the 
next day they will be in hot and heavy competition. 
Territoriality i!> a prime WO"y, and it can inspire 
genuine animollity from it. The best example 
probably comeb from the San Francisco Bay area, 
where it ubed to be that if any band wanted to do a 
show there, it had to be promoted by Bill Graham. 

Berman now faces a strong challenge from 
Vallon, for years the working cog in the Wolf & 
Rissmiller operation. Now on his own, Vallon has 
aimed for the top by signing many big acts. In San 

For },ears part of the Wolf and Rissmiller 
promoting combine, Larry Vallon has set out on his 
own in the increasinRly competitive San Diego rock 
promoting scene. 

The situation hasn't reached that state in San 
Diego, nor will it. But as more people move here 
from the East and start allending concertI, the 
promoting game looks to become rougher. Within 
the next couple of yean;, it will most likely become 
more difficult for the small promoter!> to book acts. 
The music industry, like all other business in this 
country, is in the merger/consolidation state. Look 
for more concerts co-promoted or exclusively 

the firms.

creates his small Welsh town . 

The children's games and 
town gossip, as well as his own 
ideal, sensual memories, come 
to life with the heightened 
aural perception of the blind . 

And Thomas understood 
that feeling. 

Under Milk Wood is a radio 
play, performed heretofore for 
an audience that did not have 
the interfering demands of the 
theatrical experience. 

But the play's UCSD 
ensemble cast of ten. brilliantly 
directed by graduate student 
Tom Humphrey and assisted 
by an imaginative set by 
Laurie Hewilson, brings the 
show to life. 

It creates sketches and 
people that no radio audience 
could grasp, and it brings 
order to the confusion of 
Thomas' demanding poetry. 

The problems of staging a 
radio play one might expect-
moribund, verbose per· 
fonnances in a lackluster 

setting - are swept away by 
the imagination of 
Hwnphrey's staging, 

And each actor, though 
playing three or four roles, at 
some point in the evening 
takes hole of the stage and 
dominates the play , 

Certain images remain: 
Mark Browning as Capt. 

Cat listening to children out of 
school; Neil Mendelsohn and 
Sharon Silvergate as the 
sniveling, plotting husband 
and browbeating, persnikkity 
wife; Libby Dale 's clear. sad 
song to her lost lover, Wee 
Willie ; John Flanders ' 
drunken. lusty, always 
forgiven' husband ; Michael 
McClure's obscenely drunk 
barkeep; and Mendelsohn's 
Pythonesque sendup of a 
pompous, condescending 
BBC announcer. 

Thomas' text, which invents 
words and sounds to 
accommodate whatever 
onomatopoetic fit comes over 
him, is rendered under-
standable by the cast. The 
light Welsh accents never 
interfere with the show. and 
they've avoided the pitfall of 
most Thomas readers, which 
is to render the text so close to

Slicker - and Much Worse 

By Steve Roberts 
It seems that the more Paul 

McCartney learns about 
producing albums. the worse 
his albums become. The 
carefree, simple, down·home 
and sloppy-ret.brilliant style 
he used on hIS first solo albwn 
is gone. He now writes and 
records songs that are 
technically "slic~er," yet lack

exception of Arrow Through

sporting some simple but tasty 
meter changes while the drum 
maintains a 4/4 beat (a little 
trick Paul learned from 
George Martin, no doubt). 

The main coniplaint I have 
against this albwn is that it

such musicians as John 
Bonham and John Paul Jones

Ronnie Lane (Rod Stewart

lyrics to "Burning and 
Looting" are a graphic enough 

. example: few Americans are 
ready for street fighting 
revolution. Perhaps Marley 
will suffice, with American 
middle-class youths paying 
money to see an alternative to 
heavy metal. But for whatever 

reason they came, the 
audience really got off on the 
Wailers. 

Running through a broad 
cross·section of his music, 
Marley showed he is more 
than a political songwritp.r. He 
is alMl a very professional 
performer with a keen ear for 
slick production. I had seen 
Marley and the Wailers 
perform before, but they did 
not appear as effective as last 
week. 

During that time span, my 
interest in reggae had 
increased greatly. After 1 had 
panned a Marley show several 
Years back, J received this 
letter from Andrea Hatlersly, 
a disgruntled reader. 

"If reggae 'bores the shit' 
out of you (Guardian, 
6/2/76), it must be because 
you either lack an intellectual 
understanding of the genre -
perhaps you have not been 
adequately informed but have 
fallen prey to the admitted 
hype reggae is currently being 
subjected to in the process of 
co·optation; or you have the 
aesthetic tastes of a snail.

I tried not to take the crack 
about having " the aesthetic 
tastes of a snail" to heart, but 
continued on . 

"In spite of the contradic· 
tions its appearance in this 
country creates, reggae offers 
a viable alternative . to 
American rock. Give it 
another try ... " 

Since I had never received 
such an intelligently precise 
response to a review , ' it 
prompted me to explore 
reggae music and its origins a 
little further. Three years later, 
I have come about.face in my 
position on Marley ' s 
effectiveness as an artist and 
performer. 

I wa!l impre!lsed by the full, 
lush !lound the band put out. 
With heavy rhythms set down 
by the drums and congas, a 
potent bass line and !lome 
excellent frills from the lead 
guitar and horns, the Wailers 
have a sound as virile a:. any in 
rock music. They alMl have

SAAC demands. Unknown to 
the AS -the resolution was 
!oimply to Ilupport or not to 
support. Yet the council felt it 
incumbent upon themselves to 
change and dilute the 
demand!o. At this time it should 
be said that the dem~nds the 
AS endorsed were no longer 
SAAC's, but its own. 

Contrary to the opinion of 
some uninformed individuals, 
SAAC has no personal 
vendetta against any 
administrator, but it does have 
a vendetta against . those 
people w~o !of and in the way of 
equa lit y, jUl>tice and 
affirmative action.

glad," it ripped right through 
me. 

Dylan talked to the 
audience. He never did that 
before. He lold us about how 
the world wa& going to be 
destroyed, and God was going 
to establish his kingdom in 
Jerusalem. . 

He machine.gunned us with 
half 'a dozen praise-the-Lord 
songs before leaving, then 
came back and finished off 
with two more. I didn't know 
what to do. Every word wa& 
like a "corkscrew in my heart," 
real genuine emotional pain. 
People were clapping for an 
encore, they seemed to like it. 

I wanted him to come back 
too. I gently stamped my foo~,

In shout. Normally you feel a 
certain fraternity for fellow 
spectators at a concert, 
moving together with the spirit 
of the mUl>ic. But these 
people ... cheering ... what in the 
world did I ha ve in common 
with them? Why did they 
cheer? Why didn't they boo? 
Why didn't I? Why did I want 
him to come back? He was 
killing me? 

He did kill part of me, a part 
which needed killing, which 
only he could kill. Now I don't 
give a damn what Bob Dylan 
believes. For a while he 
seemed to believe in a lot of the 
same things I did . So what? 

Rimbaud quit writing at 20. 
Hemingway shot himself at 
60. Dylan hal> abdicated at 
40. May he live. in peace.
