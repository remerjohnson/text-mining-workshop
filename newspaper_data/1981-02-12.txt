Will UCSD 
• receIve a 

good grade? 
Accreditation 
"eam here today 

BY KATHY HUFFER 
Editor 

With a mixture of 
confidence and nervousness, 
administrators, faculty and 
staff members will show 
themselves off today and 
tomorrow to a small but 
important regional accredita-
tion team. 

Unlike the team's turbu-
lent visit in 1976, when 
student protestors staged a 
large rally to demand that 
UCSD be denied accredita-
tion, the team's student 
reception today is expected to 
be Quiet and orderly. 

The three-member team, 
representing the Western 
As ociation of Schools and 
Colleges, is conducting a 
"midterm" review of the 
university to determine if 
act:rt!ditation hould be 
extended 'for another five 
years. 

With less than two full 
days to scrutinize the 
university, it is a foregone 
conslusion that the team will 
grant UCSD the extension. 

Their nod of approval will 
mean the continuation of 
federal funding in such areas 
as student financial aid ,and 
research contracts. 

Five years . ago W ASC 
granted UCSD accreditation 
th rough 1986, but cited 
numerous areas to be 
imprOVed or modified. 

Their visit today and 
tomorrow will focus on these 
weak areas, to determine if 
UCSD has complied with 
their requests . 

In anticipation of the-
team' i it, UCSD ha 
prepared a 57-page "self· 
study report" that addresses 
complaints made in 1976 
W ASC team report. Accord· 
ing to the tudy, UCSD has 
sufficiently dealt with most 
of the cited weaknesses .. 

Whether or not this is true 
is up to team mem bers Robert 
MacVicar, president of 
Oregon State University, 
Bruce Dearing humanities 
professor from the Upstate 
Medical Center at State 
University of New York and 
Patricia Cross, a visiting 
pfofessor at the Harvard 
Graduate School .of Educa· 
tion. ' -

Their conclusions will be 
given to Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson late tomorrow 
afternoon, following aeries 
of meetings with administra· 
tors, faculty and staff 
members and student 
organizations. 

Student leaders have aid 
they will address several 
i ues to the team, including 
affirmative action deficien· 

~ies, efforts to departmental· 
Ize the communications 
program, inbalances between 
science and non·science 
academic di ciplines and 
access to university 
meetings.

His ' action set off a 
maelstrom of potential 
lawsuits and disciplinary 
action. 

Sham told students, press 
and TV crammed into the 
Academic Senate committee 
meeting room Monday 
afternoon that they would 
have to leave so that the 
committee could discuss 
"matters of a .confidential 
nature" dealing with the 
Incomplete policy. 

"I would like you to set an 
example, Mr. (Bill) Topkis, 
and leave," he told the AS 
President. 

Topkis left, but when a 
number of students and 
reporters form the Guardian, 
new indicator, fA Jolla Light 
and The Evening Tribune 
made no move to go, Sham 
and the committee walked to 
the police building on 
Matthews campus and there, 
after police ' barricaded the 
entrance, met in secret. 

Sham also made good on 
his threat to institute 
disciplinary action against 
studente refusing to leave, 
requesting to Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage that the students 
be disciplined. 

Armitage met Tuesday 
morning for an hour and a 
half with the college Deans to 
decide how to proceed in the 
disciplinary action, which 
could be as severe as 
expul ion, or as light as 
probation or no penalty . He 
refused comment on the 
meeting. 

He did say, however, that 
there would be "no 
precipitous action," and that 
he not only hadn't decided on 
disciplinary mea ures, but 
also on how to go about 
determining whether there 
should be any punishments 
at all. 

.Armitage also didn't know 
what would bedoneaobut the 
non-student press at the 
meeting, but Chancellor 

,Atkinson said ye teday that 
he thought "they hould 
get. .. punishments ," as 
students do. 

Sham aid immediately 
after the Monday meeting 
"that I issue my warning 
only to the students." 

The CEP met for two hours 
behind the closed door of the 
police building, finally 
deciding, according to 
committee member and 
History Profes or Michael

Vidal's reasoning on Constitution faulty 
Editor: 

As I read the article on 
Gore Vidal's talk (GUIlrdion, 
Feb. 5) I thought, "I really 
should have gone to hear 
him." He made a lot of sense 
talking about representative 
democracy, elimination of 
media blitzing tactics from 
politicaf campaigns and the 
meffectuality of our two· 
party system. When Mr. 
Vidal declared the "root of 
the problems facing us" to be 
our Constitution, my spine 
stiffened. It was evident (to 
me, at least) that ' Mr. Vidal 
has never read James 
Madison's notes on the 
proceedings of the· Constitu· 
tional Convention or The 
Federalist. If he had read 
them, he would know any 

. ambiguities that exist in the 
document are intentional. 
Further, his attribution of 
"Jefferson's 'pursuit of 
happiness clause'" to the 
Constitution shows he's lived 
in France too long! (See the 
Declaration of Independence 
for that passage.) ~. . 

Mr. Vidal was much 
kinder, apparently, in his 
talk at MandeviIle than he 
has been in TV and magazine 
interviews, probably in 
deference to a live American 
audience. In the interviews 
he used to ascribe (and, in my 
view, correctly) the problems 
of American society to an 

apathetic American public-
not to the Constitution . 
Would we have a "dictator· 
ship of the executive" if .we 
citizens hadn't allowed past 
presidents to usurp the 
powers requisite for such a 
dictatorship? Likewise the 
Supreme Court. The powers 
of impeachment and trial still 
exist. (Where? In that very 
Constitution Mr. Vidal would 
re·write.) 

No, it s not the Constitu-
tion but the citizenry of the 
US. that's screwed·up. When 
the new administration can 
claim an endorsement of 25 
percent of the eligible voters 
is a "landslide" and provides 
a "mandate," something's 
wrong with the US. As 
Thomas Hobbes said in 
Leviothan, "he that earn· 
plaineth of injury from his 
Soveraigne, complaineth of 
that where of he himselfe is 
Author; and there!ore ought 
not to accuse any man but 
himselfe ... " In other words, 
we deserve the government 
we get. . 

Mr. Vidal's statement that 
"since World War II not one 
newly-created nation has 
emulated or adopted the 
political system of the United 
States" sounds fine as a 
generality taken without 

back~otind. But we should 
conSIder that all but a 
handful of the many, many 

Buy American-made! 
Editor: 

I am a student at Purdue 
University. I'd like to relate 
to you a reason why we 
hould buy American. 
Generally, you buy a 

product because iUs cheaper. 
Usually you can find a 
sf-nilar product which is 
American·made. However, no 
matter who made the 
product, you can expect 
repairs, sometime. In 1975, I 
took a Sears and Roebuck 
calculator back after six 
months - they gave me a 
new one. In 1979, I sent my 
Westclox clock back under 
warranty - the clock was 
repaired within two weeks. 
This year. I wrote Ford Motor 
Company a letter of 
complaint - within a week I 
had letters from their 
Indianapolis office. a letter 
from the local dealer and a 
call from the local dealer. 

That's American confi· 
dence in their own craftman-
ship. What about foreign 

Yroducts? In February, 1979. took a Japanese product in 
for warranty repair. I had 
purchased this $500 Pioneer 
Rt·707 tape deck only s,ix 
months before. I inquired 
about how the repairs were 
comingonMar.29,1979,May 
8, 1979,June l ,1979andJune 
17, 1979 and got a variety of 
answers. Well , six months 
had passed and I was still 
without my tape deck. I then 

became a student at Purdu~. 
I've written the Pioneer 
authorized service station on 
Ott. 9, 1979,Feb.6,1980,and 
Jan. 26, 1981. The only 
response I've ever received 
from them was in Ottober, 
1979, telling me work would 
be completed soon. 

I've written the Japanese 
Pioneer Warrenty Claim 
Office in Moonachie, New 
Jersey on June 23, 1980 and 
Jan. 26, 1981. I've received no 
response from this claim 
office! I've written Pioneer 
.Electronic Corporation in 
Tokyo, Joapan, on Jan. 19, 
1981 - again, no response. 
I've even sent letters by 
certified mail and received 
verificatIon of receipt. I am, 
needless to say, now aware of 
the unseen cost of a foreign 
product - repair service may 
be very poor. 

If you think you can force a 
foreign corporation to repair 
your warrantied product, 
you're wrong. I've contacted 
the Chamber of Commerce, 
the Better Business Bureau 
and the Federal ' Trade 
Commission. I suppose the 
American com panies are 
doing much of their repai'r 
work to create good will. 
They have for me. I'm going 
to be slower to purchase 
Japanese products next time. 
Maybe you too will ' buy 
American.

Get involved In ASUCSD now 
Editor: 

This is no bullshit opinion 
or editorial. This is a plea. 
Whether you are ' a college· 
oriented dorm resident or a 
commuter student, get 
involved in your Associated 
Students government 
(ASl1CSD). There are 
current issues, not only at 
UCSD, but within the entire 
U nivers i ty of Cali fornia 
system and nationwide, that 
are affecting you as a student 
and a person. 

For instance, at. UCSD all 
students are aware of the 
criminal institution COmmon· 
Iy known as the campus 
bookstore. If stooents were to 
organize and ' help the AS 
incorporate. we (students) 
could take over the book~tore 
and introduce new' ~ower 

The same lower prices 
could be established for dorm 
and cafeteria fees if the AS 
were incorporated. Incorpor· 
ation is a very real and 
possible SI for the AS. But 
It cannot achieved without 
lots- of har work. 

In case you are not aware, 
the .entire University of 
California system (all nine 
schools, plus research 
institutions) is knee·deep in 
military recruitment and 
research. Almost every major. 
development in nuclear 
weapons 'comes .from the 
University of California. 
Even if you ;ire not helping to 
make the bombs, you are 
condoning their manufacture 
and deployment through 
your apathy. . 

Nationwide, as students of 
peace, we've all had to deal 
with the registration and 
impending draft . No one can 
tell you whether or not to 
register, that's a personal 
decision. But it helps to be 
informed (something your 
.Wlrents have probably told 
you!), not only for your own 
personal decision , but in 
order to know what's going 
on in Washington, DC. 

UCSD has a problem. It 
seems to me that as students 
we should be ready and 
willing to organize and unite 
to defend or fight against 
issues concerning and 
confronting to us. UCSD has 
so much potential, so much 
intelligence, gathered within 
such a small institution. 
ut's tap it!

A la Recherche du verite 
BY ALBERT A. ALVAREZ 

Is it enough that a flower is 
beautiful in its time? Is it 
enough for a man to live his 
life as beautifully as possible 
despite the fact that his will 
always be a subjoctive and 
imperfect part of the 
Absolute Truth? Such 
interrogatives presu ppose 
that an absolute template 
doe in fact exist. But so long 
as one wishes to believe that 
one's ' life has personal 
meaning or social purpose; 
whether in a material sensate 
orientation or in a spiritual 
one, it is importunate that 
one posit an absolute - any 
absolute. Here faith, or at 
least the ability to deceive 
oneself, plays an enormous 
role. 

No one holds the truth in 
his pocket. While one may 
desire objectivity in one's 
search for a Weltan· 
sc;hauung, this objectivity is

necessary only if one intends 
to apply this view in a general 
sense. Objectivity is clearly 
sacrificed by people whose 
philosophies do not derive 
from dialectic or discussion, 
or from in sights and 
experiences of the multi-
tudes, Seeing that we are all 
narcissistic and egoistic to 
some extent, it is not 
damnable, therefore, that we 
should see the world in a not 
objoctive sense. Thus we 
seek our own subjective 
truths even if we place 
objectivity in high regard. 

Yet for someone to state 
that there is no objective 
troth, does this not 'in itself 
imply that there is one? The 
exponent of such a position 
would hold it to be true. 
Moreover, without attemp-
ting to coerce us. he would 
hope to convince us of his 
position. Ideally we would all. 
of our own free will, come to 
accept his position. Thus we 
all agree with him that there 
can be no objective truth -
but have we not just 

"objectively" agreed that his 
statement is true? . 

Let us suppose for a 
moment that a man chooses 
to live his life searching for a 
str iving to attain the 
Absolute Truth, and that in 
actuality it does not exist. 
Will his life mean anything 
more or less simply because 
he has lived a life of illusion? 
To himself he believes that he 
lived life the way it should be. 
Is that not enough to justify 
the positing of that absolute. 
whether real or illusory? Or 
is it not enough? One can 
never objectively know if an 
absolute exists_ 

Is it pos ible then to live life 
without a truth? On the one 
extreme, a man might try to 
live more "fully" because he 
rea\;zes that all he has is a 
given time on this earth. On 
the other, will he despair at 
the utter meaninglessness of 
life occasioned by the 
nonexistence of that absolute 
and therefore take his own?

America should become .a 
charter member of the 
William P. Clark Fan Club. 

For President Reagan's 
nominee as deputy secretary 
of state, the second highest 
position in the department, 
has demonstrated that he 
knows less about foreign 
affairs than any college 

J freshman who regularly 
scans the ·pictures in 
Newsweek. 

Clark told the Senate 
Foreign Relations committee 
that he hadn't sought thejob, 
was unfamiliar with . its

taking a salary cut -
"because the President asked 
me to take this position." 

But hi s 'ignorance of even 
the most elementary fa~t.s is a 
disgrace to the Reagan 
administration . Indeed , 
watching Clark's confirma· 
tion hearing was like viewing 
a "Hollywood Squares" 
rerun. 

The 49·year·old California 
Supreme Court justice 
admitted at the hearing that 
he didn't know the names of 
the prime ministers of either 
South Africa or Zimbabwe. 
He was also unaware of the 
issues involved in US· 
Brazilian relations. He knew 
nothing about the British 
Labour Party or the attitudes 
of Western Europeans 
toward the deployment of 
new US missiles there. 

"We kept throwing him 

basketball -size questions to 
answer," explained Ohio's 
Sen. John Glenn , "and he 
kept missing them." 

Like a teacher looking 
admiringly an his favorite 
student, an embarras ed 
Sen. Glenn finally turned 
away from factual questions 
to seek Clark's opinions on 
such subjective topics as 
nuclear proliferation. 

"At this juncture, I don't 
have a persona l view," 
replied Clark. 

Annoyed, Glenn then 
asked Clark one of those 
"What was the color 'of 
George Washington's white 
horse" questions: 

"What is the obiective of 
US foreign policy?" asked 
Sen. Glenn. 

Justice Clark paused , 
searched the ceiling for an 
answer like any school kid

does when in trouble, and 
declared, "Peace through 
strength." 

When asked to define 
strength , Clark offered a 
textbook answer: "Strength 
can be a lot of things -
economic, mili·tary and 
politica1." . . 

At day 's end, Sen. Glenn 
summed up the committee's 
mood: "This has been one of 
the most unenjoyable days 
I've spent in the US Senate." 

Surely, Justice Clark's 
testimony proved · one thing 
to every school kid in 
America: It 's not what you 
know but who you know that 
counts. 

And Clark's history is 
testament to that fact. He 
was Ventura (Calif.) County 
chairman for Reagan 's 
gubernatorial campaign in 
1966, became the governor's

Los Alamos, a University of 
California weapons lab has been 
deemed "a national asset" by 
Congress. It appears that Congress, 
in pursuit of peace and happiness 
for it's citizens, has come to 
depend heavily on war equipment. 

Recently, a reporter asked 
Alexander Haig whether he 
believed, 

"Peace to be the most important 
goal of the State Departmen~ 
Foreign Affairs, and the Reagan 
Administration?" . 

Haig respOnded, 
'There are more important things 

than peace ... the national interest for 
example ... .. 

More recently (1 -27-81) Haig 
announced at a press conference 
that "Terrorism will replace human 
rights" as the new administration's 
primary goals.

-Day care finds a 
friend in adnt'n 
Atkinson supportive, 
but fears budget cuts 

BY JACK DANIELS 
Staff Writer 

Chancellor Richard students who did not have

with children will be glad to Three days later, on May 
hear, says he is "very much IS, the Reg Fee committee 
committed to the concept of responded, earmarking

'- The Daycare sit-In students are arrested as 500 watch. 

Since its inception in 1969, Since that time, many 
the UCSD Daycare Center people not closely associated 
has faced numerous admini· with the Center and its 
strative obstacles, the most operation may have assumed 
drastic of which arose in May that its financial situation is

William D. McElroy rejected daycare's stability here

tion Fee Committee. state budget endangers the 

McElroy also threatened to 
close the center, fire the 
members of its staff and turn 
the responsibility of campus 
childcare over to an outside 
franchise. 

In response to these 
developments, hundreds on 
on·campus daycare suppor· 
ters rallied outside McELroy's 
office for three days, May 10· 
12. Twenty·one people were 
arrested on the final day for 
staging a sit-in inside the 
office, which afone point held 
over 50 demonstrators. Most 
of the people involved in the 
rally were undergraduate 

state subsidy that covers 
nearly 75 percent of the 
Center's costs. 

This latest difficulty, 
though, finds the center with 
a few more friends in high 
places. Chancellor Atkinson, 
unlike his predecessor 
McElroy, supports the 
concept of childcare at UCSD 
and plans to do his best to 
ensure its continuation here. 

(Atkinson served in 1968 as 
a special consultant to Robert 
Kennedy in matters of 
education during the late 
Senator's presidential 
campaign. In that role, the 
Chancellor wrote several 

position papers for Kennedy 
on day care and Head Start 
programs in the US). -. 

Atkinson admits that 
maintaining and expandirig 
the services offered by the 
center - current ly licensed 
to care for 32 pre-school aged 
childrE!n an hour - is made 
more difficult by impending 
cuts' in the budget of the State 
Department of Education. 
Such cuts are deemed 
necessary since California 
faces a $1 million deficit in 
next year's state budget. 

"Our future is very much 
tied to state fundmg for 
day care activities. Obviously 
we can't do things without 
funds," he says. 

Atkinson laments the fact 
that valuable social programs 
such as daycare are often the 
first to suffer when funding 
cuts occur. 

"In my judgment, these 
daycare centers should not be 
at the top of t he list for 

FEEL AD 

(funding) cuts but at the top 
of the list for funds," he says. 

Atkinson's views are 
shared by Susan Brock, who 
for -the last 12 years has 
served in Sacramento and 
Washington, DC as a lobbyist 
for . childcare programs in 
California. Brock is also the 
childcare consultant for the 
UC system, providing the 
daycare centers on each 
campus with any technical 
assistance they need 
concerning funding, opera-
tion and organization. 

Brock recently attended a 
meeting of UC daycare 
directors at the International 
Center here. The meeting, 
hosted by UCSD Daycare 
Center Director Jpsie Foulks, 
focused on the various 
problems that each of the 
campuses are having with its 
funding and facilities. The 
group also explored what the 
funding "picture" would look 
like throughout the next five 

years. 
"This is the worst year 

we've fated," says Brock, 
pointing out that all of the 
State Department of 
Education su bsidies for 
day care are "in jeopardy." 

Part of the problem lies in 
the fact tlHtt Governor 
Edmund ·G. Brown, Jr. is 
proposing a 4.5 percent oost 
of living increase in next 
year's budget. With inflation 
currently running at 12 
percent, the "increase" 
actually translates as acut in 
the amount of money 
available for state programs 
and services. The state 
legislature is also expected to 
cut $500 million from 
Brown's proposed budget by 
June 30 of this year. 

Therefore, Brown's 
increase in meaningless, or 
as Brock puts it, "hogwash." 

Like Atkinson, Brock 
regrets that services such as

Day care center finally 
finds a friend in adtn'n 

.Atkinson supportive, fears cuts 
continued from page 5 
childcare get the axe first 
when the state budget runs 
into trouble, 

"As the state budget gets 
cut , children's services 
always take a big cut because 
kids don't vote and don't pay 
taxes and are not a political 
constituency," she says. 

Because sources of state 
money are rapidly drying up, 
Brock feels the only thing 
that can be done for now is to 
maintain existing childcare 
services in the UC system. 
Expanding services and 
facilities are "out of the 
question" for the next four or 
five years, she says. 

"We must stay where we 
are and provide sufficient 
cost of living (increases) so 
that program s aren't 
substantially cut-," Brock 
says. "The challenge to the 
UC programs is to come up 
with alternate funding to 
maintain the services." 

In pite of the gloomy 
forecase for university 
daycare, Foulks not only 
intends to maintain the 
services offered here, but 
hopes to expand the facility 
as wei\. 

In fact, the demand for 
daycare right now is high: 
nearly 200 people are waiting 
to enroll their children in the 
program, says Foulks. 

"We have to expand the 
cetner," says Foulks, who 
has been with the center 
since it opened in 1969. While 
she admit that he does not 
plan to increa e the facility's 
services, she want to 
"expand in creative way" 0 
that more people - e pecially 
students of color with mall 
children - can participate in 
the program: 

"It's not going to be easy, 
but the need is there," ·she 

says, particularly among ' 
those students who are 
returning to school after 
having spent a few years 
starting a family. Not only 
would an expanded and 
highly qualified center serve 
the needs ' of these people, it 
would also serve as a good 
reason for prospective 
students with children to 
choose . pCSD · 'over other 
colleges. 

Foulks will discuss the 

center's future at the Reg Fee 
meeting on Feb. 16. 

Foulks acknowledges that 
getting the necessary funds 
for enlarging the day care 
program will be anything but 
easy, and is exploring other 
options for obtaming oney. 

"I know that the 80s are 
going to be ~ism~! for the Reg 
Fee CommIttee, she says; 
" but we'll try to find ways to 
expand, yet b e cost-
effective. "

~ontinued from page 2 
enler into this equation? Is 
the function of conjuring up a 
mythical absolute merely to 
provide life with a vital lie? If 
life means nothing to a 
universal truth, how can an 
illusion save us from the void 
- if we are not there already? 
If there is no Absolute Truth 
this implies that there is no 
meaning to life now or, if one 
wishes to believe, in an 
afterlife. How can man's ego 
reconcile this dilemma? Here 
perhaps, the vital lie is 
important only in giving 
temporal hope, even though a 
false one: 

What is more important-
~o live "beautifully" for an 
Ideal (even if it means living 
under a delusion or a false 
hope) or to recognize the only 
truth, that there are no 
truths in the world? One's 
consequent action at the 
realization of these antino· 
mies is si mply a matter of 
personal choice. 

What then gives meaning 
to existence and what 
differentiate it f~m a 
meaningful being, if there is 
any diffe ence? If there is a 
truth, is it even for man to 
understand? Perhaps the 
flower knows. Perhaps it 
does not even care. Does it 
really matter anyway? And if 
we are to agree with what has 
been heretofore written, are 
not the blossoms of this 
cogitation also futile? 

Bill Clark 
continued from page 3 
believes Clark's ability to 
work well with the President 
far outweighs his inexper-
ience in foreign policy. 
Others, such as Sen. Sam 
Hayakawa (R-Calif.) believe 
in on-the·job training. 

" I didn't know anything ' 
when I started on the Senate 
Agriculture Committee," 
said Hayakawa, "but after a 
couple of years I learned the 
subject well." 

But is a top policy-making 
position at the State 
Department the place (or a 
novice? 

Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
thinks so. He defended Clark 
with the "mediocre p,e;<?ple 

. deserve representation' line . 
"Maybe it's a good idea to 

have a guy in the State 
Department who doesn 't 
know everything," said 
Helms. "Give Clark a month 
or two on the job and we'll 
find out if he's really a 
dummy." No one asked Sen. 
Helms if he preferred a 
mediocre doctor for his next 
operation . 

Clearly, President Reagan 
isn't looking for mediocre 
representation in the State 
Department. He wants Clark 
there to keep en eye on 
Secretary of State Alexander 
Haig. Moreover, with Clark, 
Reagan will have brought his 
old governor's staff to 
Washington. It doesn't 
matter to Reagan whether 
Clark confuses Zimbabwe 
with a new strain of athlete's 
foot. 

It may be inexplicable to 
·"Au and "B" students why 
President Reagan would 
select a novice for a top policy 
position when international 
order is changing so rapidly. 
Yet, there's nothing like 
jumping to the head of the 
class when you're the 
teacher's pet.

In athletics 
Academics and quality compatable? 

BY SCOTT ALLISON 
Staff Writer 

The women's volleyball 
team and the men's volleyball 
team at UCSD have very 
little in common . The 
women's quad has qualified 
for the national two years in 
a row and is a solid 
organization, whereas the 
men spiker have been 

stru~ling this year with an 
untried coach and a shaky 
line-up. 

But if there is one thing 
both teams have in common, 

. it is their almost universal 
dissatisfaction with UCSD's 
Athletic Department-

"The Intercollegiate 
program needs improvement, 
and to get that we need more 
leadership and direction from 
the P-E. Department head 
and the Athletic Department 
head," says women's coach 
Doug Dannevik, echoing the 
sentiments of many. 

Specifically, the voJleyball 
troops complain that they are 
given lower priority on gym 
time than P.E. classes, that 
they don't always have 
decent equipment and that-
playing without the support 
of either the students or the 
Athletic Department is 

• disheartening. 
The men's and women's 

coaches are especially critical 
of the manner in which they 
and their peers are paid. The 
listed salary is about seven 
dollars an hour; in actuality, 
with all the hours a coach 
must put in, the pay turns 
out to be lower than 
minimum wage. The 
embarrassingly low salary is 
indicative of the little support 

therefore often lack incentive 
- except, perhaps, to find . 
another job. 

Current men's volleyball 
coach Steve Upp knows what 
it's like to play under a 
system that encourages 
coaches to depart quickly . He 
had three different coaches in 
his four years on the men's 
volleybaJl team. 

"Coaches come in and 
don't know the system," says 
Upp. Then they leave and 
"there's no continuitx and 

• it's fru trating for all. ' 
Thus, not only do student-

athletes have to contend with 
a system that often lure 
inferior or untested coaches, 
but they also mijst endure the 
high turnover rate among 
these coaches. 

" I don't think it's right the 
way it is, because it's unfair 

to the athlete who pu'ts in the 
time," ay spiker Cheryl 
Wright. " Often the best 
players become disenchanted 
and go elsewhere. It' s easier 
than trying to change 
things." 

Many volleyball players 
insist that high quality 
academics and high quality 
athletic are compatible at 
UCSD. Veteran outside 
hitter Jon Mooney cite the 
overwhelming uccess of 
intramurals at UCSD '3S 
proof that this campus can be 
athletic-minded. 

"Maybe we need Mike Hipp 
and Scott Berndes (coordi· 
nators of UCSD intramurals) 
running t he intercolle-
giate ," says Mooney. "They . 
know what they're doing. " 

Kate Borden of -the 

women' team believe that 
the Athletic Department 
"leave a lot to be desired;" 
Jon Mooney ha "a bad taste 
in my mouth from the 
Athletic Department;" and 
middle blocker Rick Cezares 
calmly asserts that "they 
(ALhleti Department 
officials) don't give a shit." 

It is quite obviou that so 
many players are fed up with 
the quality of Intercollegiate . 
Athletics at UCSD that they 
are willing to speak out 
critically about the program_ 
Granted, a few spikers are 
happy with the status quo. 
But they are a minority. 

If it were ' just the men's 
volleyball team spoutin~ off 
about weak intercollegJates 
at UCSD, it could be 
dismissed as "sour grapes" 

B-ball wins, face tough games, 
need 3 victories for plaY9ffs 

BY BOB McSPADDEN 
Staff Wriler 

UCSD's mens' basketball quad roUed past 
the Mustangs of L.A. Baptist College here 
Tuesday night, 76·68. It was theTritons' first 
victory in their last four games, and keeps 
their chances for a playoff berth alive. 

scored two of hi 12 second-half points and 
Kevin Douglas added four more to put UCSD 
ahead for good , 56·49. 

With the win, UCSD moved to within half a 
game of second place in the NAIA Di trict III 
Southern Divi ion. " We need to win three or 
even all four of our remaining games if WI:! 
expect to make the playoffs," reasoned Block. 
Unfortunately for the Triton ,all remaining 
games pair them with team who have 
defeated UCSD earlier in the season. 

"We're playing much better as a team," 
said Triton coach John. Block "Our shooting 
is better and the team is playing -more 
intelligent basketbaU." 

Each team traded the lead several times in 
the first half, but theTritoos rallied to take a 
32-25 advantage at the intermission. 

Haynes and teammate Dana Bedard paced 

from a team ,that is 
struggling. 

But when cri t icisrn 
directed toward the Athletic 
Department oomes from the 

coach and players of the 
women's team, people should 
perhaps take notice. The 
women's voJleyball team is 
one of the most successful 
programs at UCSD. If they 
aren't satisfied with athletic 
policy, then jus.t who is? 

This is the third in a series 
about intercollegiate athktics.

.How about the police? 

Student picket investigated 
continued from palle 1 
Students representatives on 
the committee feared that it 
might ignore police conduct 
at the recep.tion, where 
officers forCibly removed 
peaceful demonstrators from 
outside the Mandeville 
Annex, the committee 
decided at its first meeting 
Tuesday to make that its first 
priority. 

"I'm pleased and encou· 
raged," said one AS 
committee representative 
Bill Topkis. "We've decided 
to devote the first three 

meetings specifically to 
examining the events that 
took place on Oct. 14." _ 

Had the committee 
neglected to address that 
issue, Topkis and the second 
AS representative Reggie 
Williams would have refused 
to serve, as per an AS Council 
resolution pac;sed on Jan. 21. 

Topkis expects the 
committee to "take a close 
look" at the issues of whether 
or not the police warned 
protestors before acting to 
remove them and whether 
their use of force was pro~r. 

--------------------------

"I have some real nice 
questions for (Police Chief) 
Hugh French," said Topkis. 
"For instance. I want to 

know who, if anyone, gave 
students a warning before 
moving them, and if that 
person had the authority to 
do that." 

Topkis also plans to find 
out why police officers moved 
witllthe speed and force they 
did. 

Should French refuse to 
attend the hearings and open 
himself up for questioning, 
Topkis says the committee 
may write Atkinson and ask 

him to request that French 
make an appearance. 

French was unavailable for 
comment. 

Once some conclusions 
about the Oct. 14 demonstra· 
tion have been reached, the 
committee will "examine the 
use of police photographers at 
rallies, decide how to handle 
rallies and demonstrations in 
the future and work on 
forming a permanent police-
student committee to handle 
complaints about the 
department," Topkis said.

Take a long walk 
off a short pier 

.. . and you'll be surprised 
BY JONATHAN KROLL 

SUlf! Writer 
Take a long, very longwalk 

off of Sctipps pier, hang a left , 
and pass the Mexican border, 
continue walking until you 
descend 8,000 feet below sea 
level and you will encounter 
not the desolate rocks and 
sediment of the ocean 

. bottom, but rather discover 
an underwater oasis teeming 
with life. . 

In his lecture "Deep Ocean 
Hot Springs: An .Oasis of 
Life," Bud Smithey, senior 
research associate at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, 
described ' the .unexpected 
wealth of life that has 
recently been discovered at 
specific points deep below the 
ocean's surface. 

community of life. Here, too, 
filter feeders live off the 
chemosynthetic bacteria , 
which owe their existence to 
the hydrogen sulfide being 
formed at the vent spot, he 
said. 

"There is only a three year 
history of exploring these 
things," he said, and so much 
is still unknown about these 
underwater oases. 

Smithey and other 
biologists and geo-cheinists 
"just received funding for 
fu ture dives," so the research 
will continue. 

Smithey's lecture was the 
third in the series, 
"Adventures in Research," 
which is designed to acquaint 
the campus and the 
community with some of the 
research at UCSD, and is 
sponsored by the Council of 
Provosts, Third College and 
the Pu blic Information 
Office. .

Prof Zimm 
wins NAS 
honors 

Bruno H. Zimm, UCSD 
professor of chemistry. has 
been awarded the National 
Academy of Sciences Award 
in the Chemical Sciences, one 
of 10 awards presented by the 
Academy honoring indivi-
duals for outstanding 
scientific achievements. 

The award in the chemical 
sciences, and the other 
prizes, will be presented to 
the recipients on April 27 
during the Academy's 118th 
annual meeting. They 
recognize individuals who 

-have made significant 
contributions to science and 
its applications. 

The award in the chemical 
sciences to be presented to 
Zimm was established by the 
Occidental Petroleum 
Corporation in honor of 
Armand Hammer. It carries a 
$5,000 prize. Zimm was cited 
for his "contributions and 
influence in theoretical and 
experimental polymer 
chemistry, notably his work 
on polymer interactions,

Smithey, a biologist and ·, 
photographer at Scripps, 
used slides and diagrams to 
reveal these "spectacular 
biological communities" to 
an audience of 60 students, 
faculty, and staff persons 
present at the Chancellor's 
Gonference Room yesterday. 

Smithey ' detailed the 
geological and biological 
reasons for the existence of 
life at that great depth . 

lbu know youw .fOund agood/riend . 
Share your feelings with the special flavor ojSuisse Mocha. 

He said the earth's crust 
below the oceans is 
expanding at five to 25 
centimeters per year. This 
creates a rift where cold 
bottom water trickles down 
and comes into contact with 
the hot molten rock .of the 
mantle. The water is heated 
and undergoes a chemical 
change before bu bbling back 
up with newly created 
hydrogen sulfide. Bacteria" 
through chemosynthesis, use 
the hydrogen sulfide for food 
and are then eaten by higher 
organisms. 

"Until 1966 no one had 
seen a deep water hot spring. 
Scientists previously 
thought that not much 
dynamic action happened in 
the oceans," Smithey said.d 

In 1976 researchers from 
Scripps discovered these hot 
water springs, alsu called 
vent spots, at the expanding 
sections of the Earth s .crust, 
Smithey said. 

In 1977 researchers 
descended in a three-man 
undersea work vehicle 
named Alvin, laden with 
camer.as and s.am pling 
equipment, near the 
Galapagos Islan and 
discovered a varied amount 
of sea life at one of the 
"hydrothermal vent spots," 
he said. 
- Foot long clams, ane-
mones, dense aggregat ions of 
muscles, giant tube worms, 
tiny shrimp and many other 
filter feeders were disco-
vered. Prior to this discovery, 
people had no hint of the 
tremendous life down there, 
he said. 

Mere recently, scientists 
have visited vent spots 200 
miles off the Mexican coast. 
"Here the water comes up 
through solid rock and 
reaches 350 degrees centi-
grade when it comes in 
contact with the cold, two-
degree bottom water," 
Smithey explained. 

These "vent spots," 
approximately the size of 
baseball diamonds" were also

Pilfered 'rhird World art sparks controversy 
BY JAMES TRAUB 

Pad8c: N .... Service 
NEW YORK - As the 

world's developing nations 
have become increasin~ly 
feisty in their dealings wIth 
the industrialized world, the 
st'rusgle for self·assertions 
has spread from politics to 
natural resources to the flow 
of information and news. 
Now a less public debate has 
sprung up over the control of 
"cultural property" - the art 
objects and archaeological 
artifacts that, since the 
zenith of colonialism a 
century ago, have found their 
way from the temP.les and 
relJIious sites of poor nations 
to the museums and private 
c:oUections of Europe and the 
United States. 

Collectors, galleries balk at demands for return 

Over the last decade a wide 
variety of countries, 
including Nigeria, Zaire, 
Indonesia, India, Mexico and 
Guatemala, have pressed 
museums and pernments 
to "repatriate" objects which 
they contend were illicitly 
taken from them. 

With some notable 
excepions, museums have 
stiffened when Third World 

officials have come a·calling. 
Ashton Hawkins, chief 
counsel for the Metropolitan 
Museum in New York, 
argues, "we have a board of 
trustees who manage the 
collections for the American 
pU.b1ic. How ~n . we send 
thmgs back? Idon'tthinkany 
museum can do that. We've 
been very staunch on this 
issue." 

The Nigerians, for one, can 
testify ' to the Met's 
staunchness, as well as that 
of the romplex and secretive 
network of dealers, collec· 
tors, auctioneers and 
museums which make up the 
international art world. 
Since 1968, when Nigeria 
began stabilizing after its 
brutal civil war, the country 
has sought a number of 
bronze masks and other

palace in 1897, as well as 
Oron wooden figurines

the civi l war. 

~hen the Nigerians 
established the Benin 

,Museum in 1968, museum 
authorities sent out requests 
to a number of museums for 
the donation of one or two 
Benin pieces to the otherwise 
empty hall. No response came 
back. The Metropolitan, 
whose Michael Rockefeller 
wing houses a bronze Benin 
mask, has refused to return 
the piece. The British 
Museum, where much of the 
Benin treasure reposes, has 
considered the issue beyond 
discussion (a policy it has 
also followed with respect to 
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and 
Ghana). Private collectors 
have clung to objects they 
now concede were stolen. 
Christie's,· the British 
auction house, took one piece 

off the block after Nigerian 
authorities proved that it had 
been stolen. but refused to 
re~u.rn it to its country of 
ongm. 

Ekpo Eyo, Nigeria's 
director of antiquities and a 
prime mover in the 
repatriation issue, presses 
the crusade ' out of a 
commitment to cultural self· 
awareness rather than 
p'olitical brinksmanship. 
'Our people have been 

educated not to appreciate 
their own heritage. Now we 
are re·educating everyone ... 
And as more and more people 
turn a searchlight on 
themselves and ask 'Who am 
P.,' and 'Where do I come 
from,' these objects will 
become more and more 
important." Eyo ascribes the 
resistance of museum 
directors to their "basically 
colonial" attitude toward the 
Third World. 

The Nigerian claims, 
among others, were partly

convention calling on nations 
to restrain from importing

As yet, curators and 
museum directors are fond of 
pointing out, there has been 
no very conspicuous rush to 
the bargaining table by the 
denuded nations. But despite 
the official calm , some 
authorities suggest that a

that repatriation discussions

The Tourists 
succumb to 
60's syndrome 

BY SONNY S. BOOGIE 
Remain In Light-Talking 
Heads (Sire) 

I must confess being 
substantially biased against 
the latest Talking Heads 
release. ] have never been a 
fan of theirs, much to the 
chagrin of my musician/ ar· 
tist friends. because I feel 
that their popularity stems 
primarily from their 
conceptual and lyrical 
content rather than any ' 
musical or compositional 
talent. 

Remain In Light, however, 
evinces a divergence from 
their former musical and 
conceptual style. Indeed, a 
preliminary listen reveals an 
entirely different sound -
predicated, to be sure, upon 
structural simplicity - yet 
richly embellished with 
layers of overdu bs and 
,metiCUlously produced and 
engineered, and interestingly 
arranged. 

production and arrangement 
further detracts from the 
vocals. 

The selections themselves 
are a hodge· podge of tyle , 
but a di tinctive primordial 
beat pervades the album. One 
listens to the record in 
anticipation of being 
devoured by cannibals . 
Elements ot reggae, funk and 
heavy metal are com bined to 
produce a truly eclectic 
sound. 

Despite this change ' in 
conception, however, there is 
nothing . particularly note-
worthy to listen to, excepting 

"Why does this album have 
· such wonderful production?" 
And you may ask yourself, 
"Why does thi band u e

tell rou rself, '' It surely, 
doesn t do anythi ng for me. ' 
Same as it ever was. C·plus. 

The Jazz Singer - Neil 
Diamond 

This record represents a 
come back of sorts for 
Diamond, who once virtually 
monopolized the middle-of· 
the·road audience later 
capitalized on by Tom Jones, 

achieving an effect similar to 
the . engineering on Spring'

Lumineus Btutmnd -
The Tourists (Epic) 

Technology has advanced 
substantially since the 'fni, 
especially in the music 
i nd ustry , which has 
capitalized on advances in 
the state of the art of 
recording and musical 
equipment to the betterment 
of music quality. Sadly, 
though, popular music, as 
evidenced by the Tourists, 
does not seem to have evolved 
concomitantly in originality 
or sophistication. 

The Tourists may be 
classified as a "power pop" 
band. Their songs synthesize 
the quintessential structures 
of any British Invasion pop 
combo's top 10 entry; and an 
early· Who influence is 
discernable. This is owing to 
the Daltry·like timbre and 
phra ing of lead vocalist Tom 
Rohas more than any blatant 
imitation, although again. 

, the song frameworks evoke 
immediate Who compari· 
sons. 

The overall effect of Brian 
Eno's production wizardry, 
unfortunately, is the 
su bmergence of the vocals . 
beneath the instrumental 
tracks. One should expect 
that since band leader David , 
Byrne's lyrics have thus far 
been the elling point of the 
grouP. an equitable baiance 
could have been achieved. 
And- because a number of 
studio musicians have been 
enlisted to perform and 
arrange their parts on the 
songs, the added dimension 
of instrumental proficiency

composer 
is honored 

BYT. WOLFE 
Graced wit h a fine and 

creative intellect, UCSD 
music graduate student 
jeffrey Mumford is making 
some promising achieve· 
ments in the professional 
music world. One of them is 
his composition Frammenti 
Sosperi nella Grolla for 
piano and percussion, 
which will be performed in 
New York on Feb. 12 at the , 
Carnegie Recital Hall. The 
New Music Consort will 
also be performing some 
other I)ew works by 
American composers at 
their second in a series of 
Carnegie Recital Hall 
concerts. 

Mumford began his 
career in Washington DC in 
Visual Arts. After studying 
the painting of the masters, 
he began to explore 
surrealistic art while 
developing his interest in 
music. Music, sometimes 
called "Queen of the arts," 
won him over and he's been 
ascending ever since. 

Fragments Suspended itl 
the Crotto, written by 
Mumford for pianist David 
Arden and percussionist 
Daryl Pratt, was inspired by 
the painting by the 
A ustrian· French' art ist, 
Gustav Courbet. It was 
-originally written in Aspen, 
where last year Mumford 
won second prize in a locai 
competition for his Double 
Chamber Concerto. 

A new record release from 
CRI, an exclusive classical 
JIld jazz music recording 
label, will include his 
Quartet no. 3 for Strings 
which premiered at UC 
.rvine ill p_~ember. 

Mumford is happy about 
his success and he 
'emphasizes the need for 
professionals to . support 
each other. 

"The network that exists 
between composers and 
performers is very impor- . 
tant. It has to be very solid 
because if we don't heir 
each other. no one else wil . 
especially in the ensuing 
four rmrs of the Dark 
Ages,' he said. The "Dark 
Ages" refers to the young 
mmp'oser's concern that the 
elect ion of Ronald Reagan as 
President will prove to be 
detrimental to the artistic 
world.

Perhaps "Doctors" is 
Nemporer's tongue·in·cheek 
tax write-off - an in-joke of 
sorts in the business . 

Hopefully, in anticipation 
of their mercilessly abbrevi-

"Elizabeth" and "Danger 
Man," sporting a Ventures 
surf guitar playing james 
Bond's greatest hits, will 
remain sequestered in the 
plastk wrapper until they are 
recycled into somet hing 
usable. This record definitely 
is not. D 

Toto (Epic) 
Here is a band of 

accomplished stu.dio musi· 
cians who have replaced 
Thin Lizzy as the foremost 
purveyor of power chord 

rock. We are all familiar with 
hook·rock, whereby a song 
relies on the recurrence of 
one or two guitar lines for 
form and structure, over 
which a vocalist wails, a 
bassist drones on one note 
and the drummer chugs 
along. 

Toto instead uses a 
progression of distortion· 
saturated power chords 
sustained for a measure or so 
to replace the familiar single· 
note plinking. The result is 
that it takes somewhat 
longer to become acclimated 
to the reiteration, but the end 
result is the same - listener 
vexation. To relieve the 
monotony, Toto throws in an 
occasional off-the-wall mood 
which inevitably drones on 
and likewise becomes so 
boring that you can't wait for 
the verse to repeat. 

"English Eyes" sounds like 
Randy Bachman jamming 
with jackson Browne's 
entourage, so similar is the 
chord structure to Browne's 
"That Girl Could Sing," 

. though irrespective of the 
original author I doubt either 

artist would want to vie for 
the credit. "Live For Today" 
is the group's entry into the 
power pop market, with just 
a sufficient tinge of heavy 
metal chording to give it the 
Toto trademark: "Million 
Miles Away,"like "Love Isn't 
Always on Time," is heavily 
R & B influenced, although it 
sounds .Iike a Bad Company 
rendition. 

Guitarist Steve Lukather 
turns in a typical perfor-

CEP closes 
its meeting 
continued from page 1 
case ... T,hen, we will decide 
whether present practices 
(on the Incomplete policy) are 
in conformity with current 
Senate regulations. The 
second part could be open to 
students and there could be 
hearings," Parrish said. 

Langacker will report to 
the CEP in two weeks. 

That notion represents a 
shift in..CEP attitudes. 

Sham has insisted at other 
CEP meetings that the CEP 
was considering the general 
incomplete policy to 
determine whether Reed fit 
into it. not passing 
judgement on Reed_ 

The statement he read at 
the beginning of Monday's 
meeting was the first which 
claimed that they were 
simply discussing Reed. In 
fact. a motion by Parrish to 
separate the two lost last 
week 5-2_ 

The difference is impor-
tant because personnel 
hearings are always closed. 
but whether policy meetings 
should be closed is legally 
question able_ 

"I want the university to be 
open in all its decision 
making, all its records." 
Atkinson said yesterday. 
"except where it relates to 
personnel matters_" 

The Guardian and new 
indicator are both consider-
ing filing suit against the 
univers ity to open CEP 

• meet'ings. which are now 
closed regardless of su bject 
matter. 

The ACLU is still debating 
whether to take the Guardian 
case, and the indicator is 
awaiting that decision before 
deciding whether to join the 
Guardian. 

Atkinson said yesterday he 
is interested in ending the 
whole affair, both discipli-
nary action and potential 
lawsuits. as quickly as 
possible, and suggested that 
lawyers for the press and the 
univers ity get together to 
eliminate obstacles to a 
lawsl,lit. 

Denying that he and the 
four college Deans were 
outside the CEP meeting to 
identify students who stayed 
despite Sham's remon -
strance to leave, Armit~e 
said his function was to aVOId 
a repeat of the incident at the 
chancellor's reception, when 
.police forcibly removed 
demonstrators from outside a 
reception.

during the colonial period. 
while the Ter Yuren Museum 
in Brussels has returned part 
of its Zairean collection in 
tandem with a government 
effort to help Zaire improve 
its archaeological and' 
museum facilities. 

A battery of proposals has 
issued from UNESCO and 
other international bodies 
with the goal of making 
repatriation a collaborative 
issue - bi-lateral treaties. a 
"ilobitl trust" and programs 
ofioan and exchange. 

But a more developin~

UCS'D under review as " lacking in critical substance." "There is very little to indicate in the report that 
probing analysi s and 
rigorous evaluation has been 
taking place ... or that certain 
problems are really receiving 
the kind of attention they 
deserve," the team warned in 
its final report. 

continued from page 1 
organizations had originally 
planned to stage a protest 
reminiscent of 1976 during 
the team's visit, but plans fell 

thro~ because o( schedu-
ling dIfficulties, accordin~ to 
Progressive CoalitIon 
member Jon Bekken. 

Aa:ording to Wayne Gray, 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Planning and coordinator of 
the team's visit, UCSD is 
well'prepared for the 
accredItation review. 

Such readiness stems in 
part from painful memories 
of 1973, when a visiting 
WASC team severe-Iy 
aiticized the university for 

taking their review Iightly-
and for being ill·prepared for 
the accreditation investiga-
tion. 

Because of UCSO's poor 
showing that year, it received 
only a two-year accreditation 
extension. 

The brevity of the' team's 
visit this time indicates that 
UCSD is in good standing 
with WASC and will have 
little trouble receiving the 
five-year extension. 

Still, university members 
are taking no chances, and 
Gray says UCSD is taking 
the team visit seriously. 

"There's a Jot of cynicism 

around here about what they 
can do in one day," Gray 
admits. "But we put a good 
deal of work into the self-
study report." 

The report, written by 
Gray under the consultation 
of involved departments, 
program and individual , i 
generally favorable of the 
university's progress in 
various areas identified as 
deficient by the 1976 WASC 
team. 

While the 12-member team 
that year praised UCSD for 
academic and non-academic 
progress, it criticized the 
university's self-study report 

The following areas were 
among those found to be 
deficient by the 1976 team 
and are re ponded to in the 
recent UCSO self'study 
report: 

Affirmative action - The 
1976 team was complimen-
tary of UCSD's affirmative 
action efforts, citing a 
"dramatic increase" in the 
number of non-Whites 
employed by the university 
and noting an increase in the

number of students of color. 
However, the report.notes 

that the attrition rate of 
women and minority 
students, both undergradu-
ate and graduate, is much 

hi~her . than . ~he overall 
umverslty attntton rate. 

The team also cited the 
"danger" of Third College 
being perceived as "fulfilling 
student affirmative action 
commitments for the 
university as a whole, while 
the other colleges 'proceed as 
us ual' with respect to 
minority recruitment." 

In its self-study response, 
UCSD reports that "no one 
believes student affirmative 
action is confined to Third-
College," and applauds the 
efforts of such campus 
programs as the Early 
Outreach Program in 
recruiting non-White 
students to UCSD. 

In responSe to the high 
attrition rate of women 
students, the report notes 
only efforts to step up 
~aduate women enrollment , 
Ignoring attrition of 
undergraduate women. 

Tedching Assistants - The 
1976 WASC report was 
especially concerned with the' 
low number of teaching 
assistants in undergraduate 
courses, noting that UCSD 
has one of the highest 
student/TA ratios in the UC 
system. 

Acknowledgin~ that much 
of the problem IS financial, 

.' the team suggested raising 
the number of graduate 
students as one way to 
increase the number of TAs 
and to improve undergradu-
ate retention . 

The recent self-Sludy 
report admits this deficiency, 
and express doubt that 
UCSD will be able to reach a 
satisfactory studentiTA 
ratio unless unexpected 
funding is made available. 

Academic departments -
The WASC team praised the 
growth of UCSD humanities 
and social science depart-
ments, but criticized the poor 
distribution of natural 
sciences, social sci~ces and 
humanities, planeed for a 
ratio of 40/30/30 respec-
tively. I 

It also commended UCSD 
for restricting the formation 
of new academic depart-
ments. . 

The self-study report 
admits that UCSD currently 
has a ratio of 4712517 among 
these academic areas, with21 
-percent of the student 
poJJUlation undeclared. 

While the study calls the 
planned ratio "a realistic 
objective," it stresses that 
"with the current student 
emphasis on engineering and 
reduced student load in the 
humanities," such a balance 
will not be met in the near 
future. 

The report adds that 
UCSD does "not intend to 
make cutbacks to the 
Sciences which will endanger 
their developed strengths 

d • " an prOll'anlS. 
Col/lllfS - While originally 

criticaf of the four-college 
system in its earlier reviews, 
the team in 1976 lauded the 
decentrafized structure of the 
university . 

Third College was singled 
out among the four colleaes 
as suffering the most 
difficulties in achieving its 
self-defined goals. 

In fact. ttie report 
conclu.ded that "Third 
CoIleae is a poor orphan on 
the OCSD campus, whose 
progra.ms are seriously 
undernourished both finan· 
cially and educationally,"

..... eEP has divided Its 
study into two steps, onc 
concerning the interpreta· 
tion of the I grade policy as 
applied to a particular case 
and one concerning the 
current implementation. The 
two steps are quite distinct 
from each other, particularly 
since, in the former case, the 
relevant Senate regulation is 
the one in force till 1977. The 
current J regulat ion is 
different. . 

"The committee is s till in

"The present Senate policy 
states that attendance at 
regular meetings is restricted 
to the members, the student 
representatives appointed by 
the Associated Students and 
by the graduate Student 
Council, and a member of the 
Senate staff. The chair has 
the discretion to invite 
persons to di~r.uss particular

wishes to address CEP on a

The Guardian / Thursday, Februa,ry 12, 1981 

Guardiall Ph% by Phillip Da vies 

The CEP attempts to open its meeting in the Academic Senate room. J 

Senate policy of meeting 
attendance. They contend 
that University of California 
is a pu blic agency and that by 
California law, meetings of a 
public agency must be open. 
University Counsels have 
asserted on a number of 
accasions that there are no 
laws which require meetings 
of the Academic Senate or its 
committees to be open. The 
Attorney General of the State 
of California in 1976 ' issued 
an opinion in acord with the 
University Councels' . Last 
Friday, (216/ 81 ), Mr. D. 

Dorin~on, a Univers ity 
Counsel, confirmed that the 
Univer s ity Coun s el' s 
position remains the same to 

the present. 
"To those of you who wish 

to persist in having CEP 
meetings open, I ask you to 
explore first avenues within 
the university to change the 
Senate policy. As members of 
the same university 
community, we should try to 
settle our differences 
internally. If that is not 
possible, you are still at 
liberty to contest that policy 
in the courts. If you feel that 
the time involved in these 
processes will be too lohg to 
do any good for the pre ent 
eries of CEP meeting , there 

are also legal remedies for 
that , such as a temporary 
court injunction. I hope that 

we can avoid a repetition of 
last Monday's incident, in 
which several students 
ignored the CEP chair's 
request to leave the meeting 
room. Civil disobedience, in 
its long and distinguished 
history, has been regarded by 
rational and compassionate 
men and women as justified 
pniX as the last resort... 

'The chair issues the 
warning that disruption of 
this CEP mee~ing will not be 
tolerated. He will ask the Vice 
Chancellor for Student 
Affairs to institute discipli-
nary proceeding against any 

tudent who disobeys th 
CEP chairman' instruction 
to leave the meet ing room.
