Controversy Over 
Grant Proposal 
BERKELEY - UC Berkeley 
has submilled a proposal to 
the nati on of Turkey for a 
highl y controversial grant that 
critics say would di sc riminate 
along ethnic lines and rewrite 
hi story. Under the proposal, 
the Berkeley Foundation 
would match a $750,000 
grant from the Republic of 
Turkey to expand the teach-
ing of Turkish hi story, lan-
guage and culture. While the 
grant application makes no 
promises about what the uni-
versity would teach, Turkey's 
offer has generated criti cism 
from uni versities and profes-
sors throughout the nation 
who believe Turkey wants to 
wash away from history the 
Ottoman Empire's genoc idal 
killings of tlbout 1.5 million 
Armenians during World War 
I. Official Turkish history 
hooks teach that the deaths 
wer not genocidal hut the 
result of an Armenian civi l 
war.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 

Claire Schneicler/ Guord;on

the university at least understands our needs. It's not j ust a black issue; it's a campus-wide issue. " 

Working Beyond Tokenism 
African A mericans at UCSD continue to strive for recognition despite numbers 
By Grace Jang 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students have ca lled UCSD 
"too white" or "lily white" when 
desl:ribing the ral: ial makeup of 
the l:ampus. Although some may 
take offense to such comments, 
results from the 1997 Qualit y of 
Campus Life survey ind il:ate 
th at such assertions warrant fur-
ther exploration of the ral: ial 
dynamics at UCSD. 

At 303, the number of 
Afri l:an-American students com-
prises only 2 percent of the total 
UCSD undergraduate population. 

In the survey, 44 percent of 
African-American undergradu-
ate respondents said they fee l 
that their race has negati ve ly 
affected their al:ademic experi-
ence, and 62 percent said that 

their race has negative ly aITel: t-
ed their social ex perience. 

Fo rt y percent of Afri l:a n 
Ameri l:ans do not fee l we kome 
at UCSD and 70 perl:ent of 
Afr il:an Ameri cans arc dissati s-
lied with the atmosphere of eth-
nic understanding. 

Several Afri can-American 
student s have ca lled the racial 
cl imate at UCSD a "hostile" one 
- an "unfriendly" one, at nest. 

Numbers sUl:n as those above 
prompt the l:ampus as a whole to 
think twice about the role it has 
played in iso lating its bl m.:k stu-
dents. 
Is UCSD a Hostile Campus? 

The posting of fl yers, 
rumored to have been created by 
a visual art s student , arc perhaps 
the mos t recent example of 

racial intolerance at UCS D. 
One of the fl yers ca lls for the 

"hook-hurning o f all non-
Caucas ian or non-Asian 
authors" and the "elimination of 
stupid , s low and unqualifi ed 
people from entering our' Sl:hools 
and hindering our learning," 
concluding with "Welcome to 
199!l al UCSD." 

Another flyer reads, "Arc you 
holding hands with another color 
race'! ... get a lesson on why it 's 
wrong to date interral: ially ... 
RACES JUST DON 'T MIX!" 

Overt racist behavior of the 
kind portrayed in the flyers is lhe 
exception rather than the norm, 
however, according to several 
African American Student Union 
(AASU) members.

Board of Regents Discusses Possible Admissions Policy 
MEETING: Plan would 
admit top 4 percent of 
high school seniors 
By Ryan Olson 
Co-News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents di s-
cussed a proposed plan to admit the 
top 4 percent of seniors from each 
Ca lifornia high school to the 

niversity of California at its 
monthly meeting in San Francisco 

. on Thursday. 
According to UC spokesman 

Terry Lightfoot, UC President 

Richard Atkinson introdul:ed the 
idea to the statewide Al:ademic 
Senate in l anuary. 

UC Ri verside Professor Keith 
Widaman, chair of the Al:ademic 
Senate's Board of Admissions and 
Relations with Schools, presented 
the key point to the regents' 
Commillee on Educational Policy. 

Widaman cited the admissions 
principle that the university hould 
draw students from all parts of the 
stale. 

''The faculty hopes that this ' top 
4 percent ' I:riterion would have a 
long-range eITect, raising the visi· 

hility of the university in each high 
sl.:hool in the state and motivating 

. high schools to strive to make more 
than 4 perl:ent of their students eli-
gihle for the university," Widaman 
said . 

The proposal , if adopted, would 
be put into place no sooner than fall 
2000. It would grant admission to 
approximately 3,600 students. 

Dennis Galligani , UC associate 
vice president for student academic 
services, said lilose students that 
are e ligible under the 4-percent 
proposal would still have to meet 
some academic criteria. That crite-

ria is still undetermined. 
The 4-percent proposal would 

be an addition to the university 's 
current admis ions policie . 
Moreover, Widaman said the new 
policy would not have a "large 
effect" on the number of underrep-
resented racial minorities in the UC 
system in the short run. 

The committee's response to the 
proposal was mixed. Several 
regents, including Sue Johnson and 
Roy Brophy, expressed concerns 
about the quality of students that 
might be admitted under the plan.

Grad Programs Ranked Highly 
UCSD's programs in medicine, engineering, and 

social and biological sciences received high marks in a 
recent national survey of graduate programs in the U.S. 
News & World Report. 

The UCSD School of Medicine ranked 19th in a list 
of the top 20 medical programs in the nation. The 
school also placed 20th in a listing of primary-care med-
ical schools. Additionally, the Department of 
Bioengineering ranked third , and UCSD 's pharmacology 
department came in seventh in the opinion of medical 
school deans and sen ior faculty. 

The magazine also judged the Irwin and Joan Jacobs 
School of Engineering 21st in the nation, which is a 
move up from last year's ranking of 23rd . 

Ptacing 10th in the social science category, the 
Depar tment of Polit ical Science also received high 
marks for its special ty programs. Pol itical theory came 
in fifth place, and international and comparative politics 
both ranked at eighth . The soc iology department also 
came in at seventh place, and Latin American history 
placed 10th . Experimental psychology placed ninth in 
the study. 

U.S. News & World Report will publish the results of 
the study in the magazine 's "America 's Best Graduate 
Schools '" issue and guidebook, which is available on 
newsstands today. The data is also ava ilable at the U.S. 
News website at http://www.usnews. com.The annual 
rankings of graduate schools and programs are based 
upon reputational surveys and objective data such as 
student selectivity, faculty resources, and research 
activity. 

UCSD Government Experts 
Receive Funding for Study 

UCSD political science Professors Elizabeth Gerber, 
Arthur Lupia and Mathew McCubbins received 
$140,000 from the Public Policy Institute of California 
to work on a study of voter initiativtls and their affect on 
the California budgetary process. 

The three political scientists , along with Roderick 
Kiewiet. a professor at the California Institute of 
Technology, will scrutinize the state 's electoral and leg-
islative process in order to see what influence California 's 
initiative process has on lawmakers attempts to adopt 
new solutions for some of the state 's problems. 

According to Lupia, many state initiatives can great-
ly restrict the budgetary process . One example of this 
problem is Proposit ion 13, which limits the state 's abil-
ity to collect revenues, and the contrad icting 
Proposition 98, which requires the state to spend at 
least 40 percent of the collected funds on education . 

In the study, the researchers will create a model to 
aid them in predicting how policymakers respond to ini-
t iatives, as well as how the polic ies they establish stray 
away from the original intent of their mandates. 

The first working paper of the study will be released in 
June, with completion of the study expected in mid-1999. 

The nonprofit, independent Public Policy Institute of 
California, which was established in 1994 with an 
endowment from William R. Hewlett, is committed to 
nonpartisan research on economic, social and political 
issues that affect the lives of Californians. •

American Indians of lhe hufralo. 

"There was mutual res pec i 
hetween Ihe IW O sidl!s. I!ven 
Ihough we were enemi es. For Ihe 
Indians, Ihe hulTalo was a revered 
animal," Clendenin said. "Only 
blal:ks in Ihe l11i lilary were called 
Buffalo Soldiers." 

Clendenin said Ihallhe Buffa lo 
Soldiers doing Ih('ir johs was the 
pri mary reason why so many 
American Indians died. 

"Many lime , [Ihe so ldiers I 
were het ween Ihe selilers and I he 
Indians, at: ting as a butler LOne to 
prevent eonllicls from hreaki ng 
OUI," Clcndenin said. 

Clendenin said inlcrmarri<lge 
between the Afril:\lIl -American 
so ldiers and Ihe American Indians 
was nOI uncommon. 

"Many Buffalo Soldi ers were 
part Indian and part hlack due to 
inlermarriages ." he sa id . 
"Therefore, you l:<1n understand 
some of Ihe diffi l:uliies Ihal Ihe,c 
soldiers hau in l:arrying OUI thei r

However, Ihe main 
reason was Ihat Ihe

The Buffalo 
So ldiers were 
deployed for vari -

"[n addition to 
hcing soldiers. Ihe 
Buffa lo Soldiers 
also served as park

Clendenin said. 

"There are 
scholars who 
study about the 
people of color, 
but the scholars 
never come 
from within the 
group Itself. We 
know about 
everyone and 
everything but 
ourselves. "

so much harder to be a black student.

you ha ve 30 people in a math lecture and 
you' re the only black person; that's all it takes. 
Or when you' re walking at nig ht and everyone

"You have to study. as we ll as

" It 's cairn hostility." el-Shabazz w nt inued. " It 's more of an eerie 
hostil ity. They don' t nel:essari ly have to corne get you. I would 
almost rather if people I:ame running at me. saying 'We don't want 
niggers,' hut everyhody i~ just rea lly quiet and you know th~y don' t 
like you. When you lirst get here Ito UCS DI. in the beginning, there's 
always talk ahout affirmative ac tion. to make sure to let the students 
of color know that you ,uppo~l'd l y sto le somehody's spot somehow 
or that you're not ,upposed to he here. It ·s more of a covel1 hostility. 
like a horror Ili ck. They don ' t even have to say anything."

AASU Strives to 
Enlighten UCSD 
The fo llowing is an open leller from AASU to UCSD 

regarl/illg Black History Month and the situation of 
African Americalls 1111 c all1{1I1S. 

Once a year. in February. govemment offices bring 
out their dusty posters of Harriet Tubman. Radio stations 

broad~ast excerpt s of Mal1in Luther King. Jr.·s "I Have a 
Dream" speech. Television networks play black movie 
marathons. Yes. it's that phenomenal moment of the year. 
"Black History Month ." 

As Afri can-Ameri can students at U SD. it seems the 
onl y time unyone ever carcs about our ex istence is dur-
ing the brief 2H days when " Blackncss" is supposedly 
ce lebrated. It is the only ti me of the year that campus 
restau rants serve greens. th ' only time the bookstore will 
prominently di spla Blal:k authors and the only time 
anything hav ing to do with Black culture is broadcast on 

Student-Run Television. 
Most people thi nk we Bl ac k folks should be 

"grateful" for the shortest month of the year (coi n-
cidence'l we think not). We should be grateful we 
get a nati onally rel:ognized celebration and espe-
cia ll y grateful one of our peo ple gets hi s own hol-
iday in January. 
What people fai l to rea li 7.e is how inex tricably tied 

B lack history is to American hi story. We have heen here 
for too long to he continuously treated as outsiders. 
Bla 'k culture should hc ce lebrated every day. 

There i~ silllpiy not enough time in 28 days for America 
to learn the entirety of the influence of Afril:an Americans ' 
in the United St ates. By being relegated to a month . we are 
thus being releg.lled to learning of a few token heroes, and 
a few selecti ve events that arc wrapped up in a green. yel-
low and red bow and laheled "Black History." 

We all agree to the necessity of having u Black 
History Month - for now. We just do not believe that 
America should be pac ilied by a once-a-year hi ghlight of 
onl y a handful of the wonderful contrihutions Black peo-
ple have given th b country. 

The Afri can American Student Union (AASU) of 
UCS D works ex tremely hard to promote Black History 
Month through a variety of acti vities that showcase 

A rri~an- Alllcri can I:ulture. herila1\C and history. Since 
there·arc only a handful of A fri c.:an-Ameril.::1f1 professors 
on th is calli pus. we have to work aggress ively to educate 
the ma~scs on Black h i~lO ry . 

However, we arc consistently slapped in the face by 
the fac t that th ose who attend are m<,l inly people of co lor. 
It just goes to show th at the majority arc not concerned 
wi th the issues of Afri can Americans. This is the prime 
reason ignora nce fl ourishes on thi s campus. 

We ~ t ro ng l y udvOl:ate that the curril:ulum offered at 
UCSD playa hand in promoting knowledge of Blal: k I:ul -
tu n: and hi story. AASU linnly helieves the presem:e of an 
ethnic ~peci li c ~tudies JIlajor or department in Afri can-
American ~ tudies will help to curb the rampant ignorance. 

Ignorance here at UCS D comes in many forms. It 
~ce lll s to be pa l1i ~ ul a rl y heightened thi s year, as racist 
Ilyers . suppo~edly lIlade by Vi sual Arts students as a 
prank. were passed arollnd campus. 

It is not acceptable in any way for an y entity on campu s, 
whether it was a hoax or not , to make and di stribute fl yers 
cont aining rac ial epithets and pictures. We an: among the 
minorities on this campus, who are the only ones who care. 
and the only ones who probably even noticed. 

We do not take thi s as a joke. We already fee l highly 
African American 

uncomfortable here. wh y does 
UCSD persist on making it even 
harder for us'! Whatever feeling 
these fl yers were supposed to elic -
it . they <.:e rtainl y impacted the 
Black student s. It is the responsi-
bilit y of the uni versity to ensure 
our safety and well-being. I:onsid-

Psycho Therapy 
I'm Good Enough, Strong 
Enough and Doggone It. .. 
By Mary Higgins Senior Staff Writer 
"Not A Licensed Therapist " 

The naked rcop lc arc angry. 
I' V\: rel.:eived MJlIle iralc e-mail 

recently in regards to my hard-hi t-
ting, .two-pan series on nudc beach-
es. I\rrarently my column was 
linked ur to a nudis t Web si te. 

Although the majorit y of respon-
dents expressed regret Ihat I was 
aceo,tcd by one of their own, they 
were ,rlso qu ick to chastise me for 
my cyn ica l remarks about nudism. 

Although I still think that publ ic 
nudity is a little loony. some of the 
Naked Peoplc had a very good 
point: It is unfair for me to judge an 
entire population based upon my 
limited cxrc ri cncc at Black's Beach. 

Therefore, I arologize to anyone 
whom I may Imve offendcd. 

Enough said . 
The Winter Ga mes arc coming to 

it close, and thatlTiakes me sad. I did-
n' t even realize that they had started 
until last week. but thai's not com-
pletely my fault - for some reason, 
CBS fe lt the need to ai r all the good 
sports at two in the mo ming. 

I did manage to stay awake long 
enough to watch the womcn ' s ice 
hockey team wi n a gold medal, and 
that make~ me hapry. 

Somc l)Coplc say that wlnnlllg 
isn' t imponalll , hU I I disagrel!. The

exa mple. I even got a participan t 
rihhon fu r marching in the Los 
Altos Pet Parade, and I didn ' t even 
have a pet. 

I kind of miss that stull. Now 
that we ' re grown-urs, w..: have to 
try a lot harder to get the kind of 
recognit ion we dese rve. Ten years 
ago we were the handball champi-
ons of our neighborhoods. These 
day, we ' re l!x pected to so lve w id . 
rusion. II 's no wonder we all suffer 
from pu ny lillie egos. 

Unfortunately, the on ly potential 
candidatc for a Nobe l Prize at 
UCSD is the jerk in my bio lecture 
wh ) sit s in the front and takes note> 
with a four-colored ball poi nt pen. 

That 's why I' ve decided to start 
Illy own conte~ t for the rest of us 
slobs. In a couple weeks, I will be 
sell!L: ting the winner of the 1998 
Superlative Award.

boyfriend for Most Romantic or 
your room mate fo r Most Slovenl y. 
You can even nominate your ex for 
Bigges t Jerk. 

I don't care what the award is , as 
long as the nominee is the best at 
whatever they do. This contest is 
ahoUl winning, even i fi t is as dumb 
and pointless as ice-dancing. 

You can even nomi nate yourse lf, 
although if the category is Best 
Looking you must include a rhoto.

these arc people who would ques-
tion my choice of major. 

Sometimes I do get fruslraled al 
UCS D and wish that Ihere was ei lher 
a pholojourna li sm program or a 
decent lechn ical photography pro-
gram. I long for other people 10 share 
my passion with. people who actua l-
ly know what I'm talking about. 

The visual arts "photography 
major" is a poor excuse for a photog-
raphy program. I'd be luck y to lind a 
graduate of thi ~ progmm who could 
tell me what an f-stop is, let alone 
how to shoot chrome. use Iighl ing 
equipment or shoot four-by- li ve. 

The un iversity is fai ling to pre-
pare these students for the real 
world ; graduates of the program do 
not possess even the mos t rudimen-
tary skills necessary to ge t a job in 
any fi eld of photography. 

In li ght of the visual arts pro-
gram. I have soughl out other ways 

The UCSD Guardian 

to continue my work in photography 
while li t UCSD. In ma ny ways, the 
Guardian offers me an amazi og 
opportunity. I have free fil m, a dark-
roo m. a salary and the t:hancc to 
pursue any cont:e ivable siory I want. 

Over Christmas, I spent two 
weeks in Tijuana ~h()()ting a story on 
Ihe culture and polit ics of Ihe city. As 
I trekked Ihrough di fferent districts 
of the city, I th ink I learned more 
ahout photojournalism than I did all 
~ummer. I gained the trust of some-
one in this ci ly who not only gave me 
valuank insight un M.:xican cu lt ure, 
bUI also on humanily. 

I am going 10 pursue photojour-
nalism as a career because I love 
journali ~ I1l , not just because J love 
pholography. The words pholO'and 
journali sm arc linked toge ther for a 
reason; thi s flro fession in volves 
bei ng a good journali st, being a 
good writer and being a good 
thinker. 

Abo ve all, I see it as a profess ion 
wh ic h in vo lves patience; the 
patient:e not just to be nice to peo-
ple, but to be willing to lcarn about 
Iheir past, present and future.

"At the high school confa-

say no," Ed wards sa id. "They 
looked at us funn y and as ked, 
' Why not'! It 's worthy.' We have a 
lot of majors in European stud ies 
but why not African American? 
That's very di sheartening for peo-
ple who want to come here." 

Ethnic studies department chair 
George Lipsitz said that , although 
he agrees that tAe "shamefully low 
numbers" of blac ks at UCSD sIems 
from sparse academic resources,

"\he Department of Ethnic Studies 
stresses comparati ve, relational. 
and analyti t: apflroaches to ethnit:

not likfelt to entai I the study of indi -

Anderson spoke of Ihe impor-
tance of the university's actions 
toward African-American stu -
de nts. 

"It 's not so much imponanl 
that the university Istuden ts, sla lr, 
fac ulty, administrationl necessari-

un iversi ty at leas t understand our 
needs." Andersun said . "It 's not 
just a blat: k flrobl ell1 or a hl ack sit-
uation or a black issue; it 's a cam-
flus-wide issue. And there \ a lot 
that people can do if they ta ke time 
to understand it. I don't think on ly 
black people will benefit from 
knowi ng black history or fro m 
understanding black relations in 
society. It 's knowledge that every-
one needs to gain. For others to 
have that knowledge, it will help 
African Americans. as well as 
themselves, for a better soc iety 
and especiall y for a heller schoo!."

Hawks Hurt Triton Hopes 
DOWN AND OUT: UCSD lost again to Christian Heritage, falling to 17-6 
By Kevin Mclaughlin 
Co·Associare Sporrs Ediror 

0 , sports fans, here is the situ-
alion : If the Tri tons wi n, they will . 
in all likeli hood, go to Ihe play-
offs . If Ihe Tri tons lose, 
Ihough. their hopes of 
reaching the pmt~eason 
an.: dashed like a le levi-
sion dropped from a 12th-
story wi ndow. 

And so the hopes of 
the men's ba~ketha ll t.:a m 
came crashi ng dow n. 
Playing in EI Cajon 
agai nst a we ll -rounded. if not 
well-desp ised group from Chri st-
ian Herit age. the men's team fell , 
I 04-lJU. 

It was UCS D's second clash of 
the season with Ihe Hawks. On 
Jan. 23, th.: men engaged Chri st-
ian Heritage at RIMAC rid ing un 
II -game win streak. That strcak 
was promptl y snapped, despite the 
effo rts of a rowdy Spi rit Night 
crowd, hy a score of 10 I -SlJ. 

That game had been ci rdell on 
all calendars as the mos t i mflort ant 
game of til e yea r for the Trilons. 
Fo ll uwing the tough loss, the men 
had regrouped and flut together 
another win streak to the tune of 
fi ve strai ght wi ns. 

The Hawks again denied the 
effort s of the Tritons, heating 
Ihem for the sixth stra ighl limc. 
Thi s was not for a lad of effort 
from UCSD; the men knew the 
signili cance o f this game and 

knew Ihat to beal the Hawks al 
home would take a stellar effort. 

" I thought we played much 
better than the la ·t game lagainst 
CHCl ." point guar I Adam Libby 

said. 
Indeed, whi le Ihe men 

fatally slipped late in the 
lirst hal I' agai nsl Chrisl-
ian Herit age in Ihei r fir~1 
meeting, Ihey were on ly 
down hy 7 al halft ime 
Salurday night. 

Seven poi nts docs flot 
mean much 10 the three-

poi nt happy Tri lons. However, it 
didn' t mean much to the Hawks 
either, as they played wi th compo-
sure th roughoul an intense second 
half. 

Play ing on Chri stian Her-
it agc's pi nt-sized hi gh school-like 
gym fl oor, the game hinged on 
defense. 

Li ke CS D, CHC broughl a 
ba lam:ed lineup with scoring 
punch from both the inside and 
out side, and the wea lth of capahle 
scorers the Hawks used fru ~ t raled 
the Triton defense all nig ht. 

"Every ti me we mude a run . 
they had an answer," sa id Lihhy, 
who scored 8 points. "We were 
play ing cat-and-mouse all game:' 

The Haw ks played physica ll y 
all night , setting lirm screens on 
offensc and hacking away on 
defense, never letting the Triton 
offense get into a groove. 

UCS D shot 42 free throws, 

many by center Tyler Field. CH 
had no answer for the big man, as 
he scored 13 poi nl s fro m Ihe frre -
Ihrow line for 2lJ tota l points on 
the night. wi lh a strong 19 

reb()und~ . 
Wilhoul Ihe play of Fie ll 
in ~ ide and 6 Ihree-poinlers b 
six th man Nick Marllulsos. the 
Tri toll s WOldll have been Olll of Ihe 
game much ~(loncr. As it \Va ... , the 
mcn Illade a number of short ral -
lies. bUI every tilll ': Chrislian Her-
itage had an answer. 

The Tritons scw nd- and th ird -
leadi ng s(orers had a rough night. 
Mike Wall and Ty l.:r Garratt COIll -
hincd Iu shoot 4 for 27 for 17 
points. we ll oil their usual COITI -
bined average of 30 points. 

The rea l problem for UCSD 
lay in Triton-ki lIers Beau Sager 
and B.1. Cast i 110, who scored 24 
and 25 poi nt s resflecti ve ly for the 
Hawks. 

oW UCSD is left \ il h Ihe 
sl imillest of hopes lor reaching the 
postseason, a fllace I he Tri l un ~ 
have not visited for the last thn.:e 
seasons. 

Two hUllle games remain this 
weekend agai nst UC Santa Cruz 
and Menlo College, teams UCSD 
has already heaten. After that, the 
Trilons' fate is no longer in their 
hands. 

" It depends on what 0 1 her 
teams do: ' Libby saill. "and it 's 
not good to depend on olher 
teams."

UCSD Endures Weather, 
Gains Important Split 
CHAPMAN: In a matchup with last year's Western Regional 
Champs, the Tritons proved they could play with the big boys 
By John Maynard 
Staff Wnter 

This winter, UCS D basehall ha~ been 
plagued with uncen lli nti e~, mosl of Ihem 
weal her-re lated. Star! limes have bcen 
swilched, pract ices have been 
moved and ga mes have hecn can-
I:cled. 

The Tritons wake up nOI know-
ing whelher Ihey' ll finall y get 10 
praclice on Iheir fie ld or if they' ll 
bc forced again 10 elbow thcir way 
inlo RIMAC for a pseudo-praclice. 
They also don ' l know if Ihe dri ve to 
Iheir next malchup will yicld a 
ga mc or a fruitl css denial. 

BUI despile Ihe hassles with Ihe rain , the 
Tritons feel rclali ve ly unaffected by the 
wealher. 

"The whole EI Nino thing isn' l really Ihal 
hig of a deal ," junior Eric Schramm said. 
"Whcther we prat: ti t:e on the fi e ld or in the 
gym, we're st i II able to gel our Job done." 

UCSD did it s job sut:t:ess fu lI y in a dou-
ble-header against the Panthers of' Chapman 
University, taking the tir~ t game, 9-7. Unfor-
tunately, it didn 't do as well in the sewnd, 
losing 10-3. 

The Tritons fell behind carly on in their 
lirst divisional game of the year, as the Pan-
thers managed to put 2 runs on the board in 
the bollom of the lirst inning. 

After a swreless third inning, UCSD 
finally stepped up to the plate, knocking in 3 
runs in the fourlh . 

First baseman Eri t: Pangc linan's 2-run 
homer highlightcd the inning for UCSD, 

pUll ing the Tritons ahead for good. 
Sophomore slaning pit cher Edward 

Ishak fini shed his day giving up 4 earned 
runs on 6 hits in seven-amj -a-third innings. 

UCS D added to ils lead in the lOp of Ihe 
fi fth , scoring another 3 run s, leav-
ing the Panthers down, 7-3. 

Allhough the Trit ons carried a 
comfo rtahle 5 run lead into Ihe la~ t 
pair of inn i ng~, Chapman made the 
game interes ting by scoring 2 in the 
eighlh and anolher early into Ihe 
bOllom of the ninth . 

Triton ti n i~ her St:hramm, who 
also homered, was und au nl ed . 
S~ hramm lOo k the mound in the ninth 10 
save the win for the Tritons. 

Unfortunately, the joys of vit:lOry didn ' t 
last too long for UCSD, as the Tri lOns ran 
out o f steam in the set:nnd game of thei r 
di vision-opening doubleheader. 

UCSD kepI il dose, tak ing a lied hall -
gallle'inlO the bollom of the fourth. Sopho-
more startcr Midwel Bcdar pitt:hed we ll 
through the first three innings, but faltered a 
bil in the f ourth, giving up 3 runs. 

Bedar sut: ked it up, though, getting out o f 
trouble and keeping the game tight through 
Ihe next Ihree innings. 

However, th is ti ght co nt est quickl y 
bet:ame a hlow-oul. Chapman loaded the 
bases and with one swing of the bat, UCS D 
found it self down 10-3. 

"s i nce we werc able 10 beat Chapman, 
and they are the defending t:hamps, we 
should do well in the rest of di vision play," 
Eric Pangelinan said .

\ingle day hecomes Iwice as impor-
lanl 10 a lea m. 

In the first gamc, the mighty Tri ton 
offense slrugg led against some lough Coy-
ote pitching and Triton pitt:her Erin Flanigan 
unt:haracteri sti t:ally gave up 7 runs on IS 
hit s in a startl ing 7-0 1m,s. Shortstop Bridges 

had a so lid game, going 2 for 3 al 
the platc in the losing effo rt. 

Th i~ weekl:nd, the Tri ton soft-
ha ll tCilm not only experienced both 
the Ih ri ll of viclory and the agony 
of defeat, il experi enced them 
twit:e. 

Trave ling to Pomona-Pi tl.er on 
Friday, Ihe Tril ons conlinued on 

IdI 
Looking for revenge in Ihe sec-

ond game, UCS D slifl ed Ihe CoyOle 
olfcnse with a ~ t ro ng performance 
by Al lison Jat:Ohs, who gave up 
onl y 6 hits. 

YCI Ihe Trilons could ~ Iill nO! 
li gurc out thc CSUSB pitching and 
fa il ed to st:ore a run for the second-SOFTBALL 

thcir winning ways by easily taking both 
ends of the douhleheader from the Sage-
hens. 

The infamous "mercy rulc" was in voked 
in both ma tt: hes as UCS D huilt a lead of 10 
or more runs over thc hapless' Hens. 

Before Ihe mercy rule can he counled , 
however, five innings must be played, whi t: h 
explai ns why the Tritons rac ked up sut:h 

ridi t:ulou ~ score~ of 15-1 and 19-2 in the 
gamcs. 

"We have such a strong offensive tea m, 
that we wcrc just hilling 'round the d ot:k," 
shortslop Erin Bridges said. "All up and 
down Ihe lineup, we did it. The onc-through-
nine hillers all did well." 

Riding the emotional hi gh of slaughter-
ing the Sagehens, the Tritons lrave led east 10 
fal:c the tough Division" Coyotes of CSU 
San Bernardino. Thc Coyotes proved to be 
the firsl leg ilimale competilion of the young 
season. 

Slraighl game. 
Ext:e lle nt -hilling scco nd baseman 

Chri stina Scaring had 3 hits, but the rest o f 
the Tril ons t:ould manage only 5 hits overall 
and a key sixth inning 2- run double by the 
Coyotes was the dec iding margin in th e 2-0 
t:o nt esl. 

This pasl weekend was a ro ll er coas ter 
fur the Tritons. Scoring 34 runs on Friday 
and no runs on Saturday can make a team 
question itse ll'. 

Yet, the season is Slill youn g, and Head 
Coat: h Palli Gcrt: ke ns' squad is taking 
ev..: rything in stride. 

'Th is Ica m's detinite ly cxciting to pl ay 
on," freshman des ignated hill er Michell e 
Wilson said . "Everyo nc's real easy to work 
with and we'rc play ing welL" 

Hopefull y, Ihe Tritons will get Iheir hats

The had luck did nOI end Ihere 
for UCSD as it wa~ forced to hop a 
plane to Utah 10 play powerhouse

entered the season as the nalion's

The Trilons harely had time to

Cougars ~ent them park ing once 
agai n after a 58-minut e, three-gamc 
~wecp Ihal saw BY U make onl y 9 
errors ror the matt:h. Whi Ie the 
B YU offense was in overdrive, the 
Tritons were hav ing troub le gelling 
out of Ii rM gear. 

Due to the loss of MOllnt , Triton 

Head Coach Duncan McFa rl and 
was again forced to rearrange the 
UCSD lineup and work wi th an 
already thin roster. nderstandahly, 
thc Trilon offense trugglcd to lind 

its consistency while fac-
ing a tall Cougar frontlin '. 

With Mount oul , much 
of the offensivc burden 
fell on the shoulders of 
senior hilla Jon Yarris, 
who performed admi rably. 
DeS('it ' being keyed on by

As we ll as the BYU offensc per-

There is no " I" in leam. 
This commonl y used phrase in 

athlelic circles, while true, neglects 
10 take inlo aC(;Qu nllhal whi k Ihere 

i ~ n ' l an "I," there is a "me." 
We've all seen il before, a good 

leam eroded due 10 sellish play, and 
~e lti sh alliludes. The supposed 
team, inste.id of working together, 
hecomes a co llection of indi vidu-
als, each seeking to further their 
own individual goa ls. The point : 
put your money on a good team 
that plays together, i.e. Princeton, 
over a co llection of li ve talented 
indi viduals who don' t (see UCLA ). 

This is exactly why it would be 
unwise to bet against the UCSD 
women's basketball team in the 
upcoming Division III tournament. 
Despite their individual abilities, 

the Tritons have managed to take 
Ihe "me" oul of team, and il ~h ()w~. 

It ~ I art ~ al Ihe lop. This pa~1 Fri-

"Coach Malone was 
exc ited, we all were exc it -

Coach was ve ry humble. Her foc us 
was on the players, that ii 's the

II 's offi cial : thi s team is now the

nig hl , wi lh the women 
de realing Point Loma for 
the second time Ihis year, 
82-67. Although the ' final 
tall y Friday was similar to 
the g4-6 1 CS D victory al 
Poi nt Loma on Dec: 6, this 

game had a much di fferenl fee l. 
The Crusaders hung tough and 

actually led for Ihe majorit y of the 
fi rs t half. The Tritons did manage 
10 push ahead jusl before halftime, 
as Teasdale's layup off a Turnbull 
steal j ust beat the buzzer. 

The second half was also close-
ly conl ested. UCS D opened up an 

early lead , pu~hing Ihe ad vanlage 
up 10 II p(} inl ~ , 48-37. The ru -
~ade r~ r~~pon(kd , once again rely-

womcn out~cored Poi nl Loma 11)-9 
down Ihe slrelch, securing Iheir 
141h straight victory. 

Six team members scored in 
double fi gures. Kate Turnbull was 
quite impress ive , posting team 
highs with 19 poi nt s and 14 
rebounds while Poehler and As hley 
Kokjohn em:h contribuled 12 
points. 

Saturday was also a rematch, 
this time agai nst the Chri stian Her-

The women had difti cuh y di s-
palching the Hawks, clinging to a 
5-point lead with just under 10 
minutes left in the second half. 

Women's Tennis Takes Third In A Row 
REVENGE: 
Tritons take down the 
Sagehens in Claremont, 
winning 7- 2 
By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Writer 

Think back to last yea r's 
NCAA Division III women's ten-
ni s Championships. 

UCSD - a perennial top- 10 
program with four national titles 
and four runner-up fini shes since 
1982 - went up agai nst Pomona-
Pit7er to advance 11110 the third 
round. The young squad should 
have won that match, but the Sage-
heRS upstaged Liz LaPlante's team 
and UCSD fini shed 12th overall 
- it s worst fini sh ever at Nation-
als. 

Let 's shift gears to thc 1998 
season, shall we? LaPlante and the 
Tritons traveled to the Sagehens' 
nest last Saturday afternoon with 
one thing on their mind: revenge 
and how 10 go about getting some. 

One way is to dominate singles 

play and grab Iwo of three douhles 
matches. So they did , notching an 
impress ive 7-2 victory over 
Pomona-Pitzer en route to exercis-
ing the Sagehen demons from a 
year ago. 

" It was a great win for us," 
LaPlante said . "It 's rea lly 
good for our confidence 
because it would have 
been prelly tough if we 
had lost to them again. 
We really should have 
beaten them at Nati onals 
last year, but we couldn ' t 
do it. We now have a 
good Division III win 
under our belt and we know we 
can compete with the hcst in the 
country." 

The best in the country will 
have to watch out for these young 
Tritons in the future. U SD sent 
notice, taking care of business 
early on at Pomona as it has been 
doing for the last th ree contests 
thi s year. 

The Tritons have a habit of 
grabbing at least 2 of the 3 doubles 

puinlS and they did il again on Sat-
urday. 

Becky Jones and Robyn Kon-
drack, playing at the No. 2 slot, 
notched a 9-g prO-SCI victory over 
Jamie Zadra and Mary Gould . 

Jennifer Drimmer teamed up 
with Kelli Tsai at the No. 
3 slot and handily defeat-
ed Amy Dewar and Lynn 
Scher, 8-2. 

Pomona Slaved orf the 
doubles sweep as its No. 
I grouping of Bridget 
Humphrey and Heather 
Gorman nipped UCSD's 
top duo of Kirsten Olsen 

and Maria Nguyen, 9-7. 
But winning 2 out of 3 doubles 

matches gave the Tritons a nice 
cushion going into singles play. 

And Olsen and Nguyen would 
not let thei r di sappointment in 
doubles affect them in the singles 
portion of the day. 

Nguyen, who has been on a 
killing spree in singles play, domi-
nated again as she crushed Gor-
man, 6-0, 6-1. 

Olsen fe ll behind against 
Humphrey, 6-7, 1-4 before bring-
ing down the hammer. However, 
she did not lose a game from that 
point - notching I I straight 
games en route to a great come-
from-behind victory, 6-7, 6-4 and 
6-0. 

In all , UCSD grabbed the top 
fi ve singles matches. Tsai, Jones 
and Kondrack easily defeated their 
opponents at the Ihird, fourth and 
fifth spot, respectively. 

In what was the day's most 
competiti ve match, Triton Laura 
Brams went down to Scher, 4-6, 4-
6 in a match full of hard-hilling 
groundstrokes and aggressive play 
at the net. 

U SD will try to add to its 
three-game winning streak this 
Friday aft ernoon at 2 p.m. at the 
North ourt s when it hosts Divi-
sion IJ al State Dominguez Hills. 
This will be the first meeting 
between the two schools in quite 
some time. 

On Saturday, the Tritons will 
welcome Claremont College. 

Fortunat ely, Ihe team main-
tained ils composure. McClure hit a 
dutch jumper from the ba~eline 
wilh just one second remaining on 
the shol clock. Perhaps sparked, Ihe 
Tritons executed well offensi ve ly 
in the fina l five minu tes, resulting 
in a 67-55 victory. 

Begley and Bayda eac h pitched 
in 14 points, while Turnbull posted 
her second consecutive douhle-
douhle wi th II poi nts and 10 
rebounds. 

Salurday was also Senior ig ht , 
as the team sa id fa rewell to fo ur 
seniors who have had ou tstanding 
careers. Beg ley, Poehler, Amy 
Franzen and Tianna Meri age each 
played Iheir last regular season 
game in the blue and gold. 

Clearly, thi s is a special team, a 
group of women who have had a 
very spec ial season. .
