Coming Out Day At UCSD Part of a 
National Tribute to Sexual Freedom 
DIVERSITY: An army of 
people nillied to show 
support for alternate lifestyles 
By P .... DocIle 
Staff Writer 

Celebrating their sexuality and freedom 
of choice, people of all sexual orientations 
showed up for the UCSD National Coming 
Out Day event on Oct. lOin the Price Center. 

The UCSD Lesbian Gay Bisexual Asso-
ciation (LGBA) organized this year's event, 
while the Associated Students supported it 
through funding. 

Lucy Silvay, a psychiatrist and consult-
ant at the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Trans-
gender Community Center, addressed the 
crowd .on the subject of homosexuality in 

both he~ and today's generations. 
"You are between two cultures ... amidst 

bastions of homophobia," Silvay said. "Par-
ents are sri II the same as )Vhen I was a kid , so 
you do not have the advantage of aski ng them 
how to come out in the open." 

Silvay encouraged homosexuals and bi -
sexuals to come out into the open and pro-
mote the visibility of the gay community. 

Silvay also mentiont:d that many homo-
sexuals and bisexuals ..... ere hesitant to "come 
out" because they were concerned about the 
issue of personal safety. 

"Same sex couples are the only group that 
is stigmatized throughout the world," Silvay 
said. "They are not being socialized into the 
gay culture to which they belong."

Two Test-Prep 
CorporationS To 
Merge Today 
EXAM: Hyperiearning, Princeton 
Review announced today their 
intent to produce hybrid prep class 
By Chris Schreiber 

enior Staff Writer 
With the number of medical 'chool applica tions far 

urpassing avai lab le slots, many ludents with an 
interest in allending med school look to Medical 
College Admission' Test (MCAT) prep cour es to 
improve their admissions numbers. Pre-mcd student 
at UCSD preparing for the MCAT have one less 
option for prep cia ses t<,day than they did previously. 

Hyperlearning, Inc ., the largest provider of MCAT 
prep clas es in San Diego, today announced its merger 
with The Princeton Review, which is the fa test grow-
ing national te t-preparation company. Hyperlearning 
is now the medical division of The Princeton Review 
and will run Pri nceton Review MCA T test-prep classes 
at eight California locations. 

"The new MCAT course blend the stronge t areas 
of Hypcrlearning 's program - the intensive science 
review - with Princeton Review's test-taking tech-
niques, verbal program and large volume of old tests 
and review material ' to create the finest review course 
out there," San Diego Princeton Review Director 
Sonya Petrie said. 

Hyperlearning is currently the single largest pro-
vider of MCAT prep courses in California, with over 
50 percent of the market here in San Diego. Prior to the 
merger, there were live companies in San Diego that 
offered MCAT prep classes, including Kaplan, Co-
lumbia Review, Princeton Review, Hyperlearning, 
Inc., and USD's test-prep ervices. Approximately 
500 student from UCSD are now enrolled in 
Hyperlearning classes. 

Offering test-prep classes is a big busi ness nation-
wide. The combined revenues of the two largest na-
tional companies, Kaplan and Princeton Review, to-
talling in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually . 
Within test-prep services, MCAT courses are one of 
the fastest growing segments. 

From 1990-95, the percentage of those applying to 
med schools who were accepted decreased yearly. In 
1990,54 percent of applicants were accepted. In 1991 , 
the percentage shrank to 49, and last year, that number 
fell to only 35 percent. 

The reason behind thiS trend is that the overall 
number of applicallons per year I ri 109, while the 
number of available slot has remained essentially 
constant. Pre-med tudents looking at this trend are 
turning to prep cia es in ever-increa 'ing number in

Graduate Students 
Now Have Lounge 
SPACE: Graduate students were awarded desirable 
location despite competition from the A.S. 
By Sa,. Moouvl 
Guardian Reporter 

Despite competition with the 
Associated Students. an all-cam-
pus lounge has been set aside for 
graduate students in the space that 
was formerly occupied by the 
Women's Resource Center. 

The lounge, 
sponsored partly 
by the Office for 
Graduate Studies 
and Research 
(OGSR), officially 
opened its doors on 
Sept. I to the nearly 
4.000 graduate stu-
dents at UCSD. 

The center provides "all the 
things people need to get ahead. 
even dental insurance plans." Mayer 
said. 

The center's organizaers also 
aim to facilitate graduate student 
interaction. 

"Up until now, [graduate stu-
dents) really 
haven't had a cen-
ter of their own. 
Basically, they are 
expected to be in 
labs. in class teach-
i ng students or at 
home studying." 
Mayer said. 

"Gelling the 
space was not 
easy." Vicki 
Mayer, president 
of the Graduate 
Student Associa-
tion (GSA), said. 
"Basically. [the 
decision to give the 
space to the GSA) 
was highly con-
tested." 

. According to 
Mayer. the biggest 
0PRonent to the 
graduate student 
lounge was the 
A.S., who wanted 
the area for an

Contributing Opinion Writer 

Imagine someone growing a 
marijuana planl in his backyard 
because his doctor told him that 
smoking pot would help to relieve 
stress. If Proposition 215 passes, 
this is exactly what could happen. 

This radical measure is 
designed to make marijuana culti-
vation legal for medicinal purpos-
es. To college students, this may 
not sound like a bad idea, but 
closer examination reveals that 
there is more to Proposition 215 
than it seems. 

Although Proposition 215 
could pave the way for providilfg 
relief for truly sick or terminally 
ill individuals. the measure leaves 
open too many opportunities for 
corruption and abuse by people 
whose "ailments" could be cured 
by other means, such as Tylenol. 

Propo ition 215 propose that 

medical providers be allowed to 
give an oral or written recommei\-
dation that would permit patients 
to legally cultivate, possess 
and/or smoke marijuana. No writ-
ten prescriptions would be 
involved. and governmental regu-
lation or record keeping would 
not be necessary. 

I f this measure passes, it wi II 
be impossible to exercise control 

lover the actual cultivation of mar-
ijuana in this state. If the mission 
of this proposition is merely to 
legalize marijuana use for medic-
inal purposes, then why not 
design a system in which govern-
ment-grown and -regulated mari-
juana is prescribed to patients 
who truly are in need of the heal-
ing properties of the drug? 

Other factors, in addition to 
lax regulations, make this mea-
sure more harmful than benefi-
cial . I find it eJllremely strange 

that this propOsition extends the 
range of "medicinal purposes" nol 
only to serious illnesses such as 
AIDS, glaucoma or cancer, but to 
minor ailments such as anhrilis, 
stress, nausea, migraine 
headaches or anxiety. 

Under 215, any person claim-
ing to suffer from an ailment that 
marijuana is purponed to help 
could legally cultivate, possess 
and smoke marijuana. With such 
incredibly lax standards, what 
would stqa a person from using 
his medic8lly sanctioned right-to-
grow to share his harvest with 
friends, perhaps making a lillie 
pocket money on the side? 
Conscience. perhaps? I don't 
think so. •

marijuana as anything but a last 
resort, not all physicians are as

SENSELESS WAR. ON 
DRUGS 

By Mark Paskowln 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Before launching into why 
think Proposition 215 would be bad 
for California, let me share with 
you my views about the current 
drug situation: 

I believe that the War on Drugs 
is a disaster and that broad legaliza-
tion of all drugs is the best policy. 

I am dubious as to clai ms that 
marijuana is a stepping stone to the 
use of harder drugs. 

I think that even if ma~ijuana 
were shown to be a stepping stone 
to hard-drug use, it would be utter-
ly irrelevant to users who are termi-
nally ill. 

I am willing to accept the anec-
dotal evidence that marijuana is an 
effective treatment for many condi-
tions, including glaucoma, arthritis, 

unable to nourish themselves, fi nd 
that it increases their appetite and 
helps them keep food down. 

Marijuana relieves migraine 
headaches, anhritis pain and asth-
ma, as well as reduces ocular tluid 
pressure in the eyes of glaucoma 
patients. 

These claims have never been 
put to effective double-blind scien-
tific tests due to prohibitions 
against marijuana use, but the large 
volume of positive claims, and vir-
tually no negative stories, indicates 
that the effect is very real. 
Marijuana is potentially a very 
effective medicine. 

Synthetic THC (the active 
ingredient in marijuana) is avail-
able under current law as a pill 
marketed under the name Marinol. 
Many patients use this pill and 

the "wasting syn-
drome" of AIDS 
and the nausea 
associated with 
chemotherapy. 

As a rugged 
individualist 
unfettered by con-
vention, I am 
going to go out on 
a limb by stating 
publicly, and in 
pri nt, that I am 
opposed to suffer-

While I feel that 
dru .. should be

It must be done In

than under the

results. 

However, pro-
ponents of 21 5 
point out some 
problems with 
M a' r i n 0 I . 
According to Dr. 
Paul Volberding, 
a physician 
involved in the 
care of AIDS 
patients, "some

ing, and that doctors should have in 
their arsenals all tools necessary to 
relieve that suffering. 

However, after reading the text 
of Proposition 215, the 
Compassionate Use Act of 1996, 
and the arguments for and against 
it. I was shocked to find myself 
opposed to the initiative. Simply 
put, Proposition 215 is a bad law 
based on a good idea. 

There is substantial anecdotal 
evidence that mariju;lOa can be 
used to effectively treat a variety of 
diseases. Speeific.ally. it is an effcc-
'tive anti-nausea treatment for many 
people who are not helped by con-
ventional therapie . Can~er and 
AIDS patients who are otherwise 

patients reporl a 
greater benefit with natural mari-
juana, either inhaled or consumed 
orally." 

Also. some people have trouble 
with the typical dosage of Marinol 
and are left sick or unconscious 
after taking the pill . As it is a liquid 
capsule, the dosage is indivisible. 

Additionally. Marinol treatment 
is expensive, running as much as 
S30,OOO per year. This is a legiti-
mate problem that would be olved 
by 215. Growing marijuana is very 
cheap. 

In light of the evidence so far, 
should we not.allo~ people to use 
marijuana even if . it helps? And

scupulous as the American people 
would like to believe. Is it not 
human nature to choose the easiest 
path, the quick way out? Why 
should doctors be any different? 
They might, under pres ure from 
their patients, avoid the long . 
strenuous task of finding a bener 
but more difficult solution to a 
patient's problcms if they could 
simply recommend that the patient 
grow some marijuana. 

I find it hard to believe that in a 
country as adamantly opposed to 
drugs as ours, a measure as radical 
as this could even find a place on 
the ballot. Could it be that the peo-
ple of California who signed the 
petition approving Proposition 215 
were just a teeny bit mi led regard-
ing the specific aims of the mea-
sure?

of marijuana, shouldn't we allow 
these patients to grow their own? Is 
that not what 215 is about? 
Actually, no. 

Proposition 215 has too many 
loopholes. First, there is no defini-
tion of which diseases qualify. The 
initiative ca lls for marijuana for 
"medical purposes where that med-
ical use is deemed appropriate and 
has been recommended by a physi-
cian who has determined that the 
person's health would benefit from 
the use of marijuana in the treat-
ment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, 
chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, 
arthritis, migraine or any otlrer ill-
ness Jar whiclr marijuana provides 
relieJ[italics added] ." 

This is much broader than the

for Medicinal Purposes," sounds 
like a noble and compassionate 
mission. When asked, petition cir-

culators tended to avoid the 
specifics of.Proposition 215. Many 
people, associates of mine includ-
ed, who signed the petition to put 
Proposition 215 on the ballot, are 
shocked when they discover the 
true aims of this measure. 

I personally wandered past 
many self-proclaimed "smoke 
shops" and saw petllloners 
approach anyone who looked as if 
he per onally wouldn't mind 
smoking a lillie marijuana. 

Is this pool of petition signers a 
fair representation of the people of 
California? Standing outside of 
"smoke shops," where they sell 
things such as water pipes for 
tobacco use only (better known as 
"a bong"), may be a good way to 
get signatures for a proposition to 
legalize marijuana, but it is also a 
way to wa te space on the ballot 
form . 

standard proposal of allowing mar-
ijuana use for the terminally ill. I 
understand that it also "provides 
relief' for stress, boredom and the 
inability to appreciate Pink Floyd's 
'The Wall." 

Additionally, under 215, no 
wrillen prescription would be need-
ed to legally use marijuana. People 
could grow and use marijuana 
based on the "written or oral rec-
ommendation or approval of a 
physician." Proponents correctly 
point out that more powerful drugs 
can be legally prescribed, but they 
requi re wrinen prescriptions in

doctor issuing an oral recommen-
dation can be required to testify to 
that under oath. But given the cur-

The writers of this measure 
claim that their mission is not to 
circumvent current laws regarding 
the cultivation and possession of 
marijuana outside the realm of 
clinica l use, but the system of dis-
tribution they propose indicates 
otherwise. 

If this measure passes, there

marijuana. What will the govern-
ment do when frustrated providers 
give up and begin writing 10 to 20 
culti vat ion recommendations a 
week, or even a day '! 

This estimate may seem 
extreme, but almost anything can 
happen under the system proposed 
by Proposition 215. 

There is al 0 the terrifying fact 
that marijuana has been proven to 
be a gateway drug. Perhaps some 
person who has migraine 
headaches gets the recommenda· 
tion to legally smoke and cultivate 
marijuana. This person begins 
smoking marijuana and finds that 
his pain is partly relieved. He has 
already gotten the message from 
his doctor and his government that 
marijuana is OK to use. So if mar-
ijuana partly relieves his pain, Nhy 
wouldn't cocaine or heroin cure 
him completely? 

Instead of offering a "ay to 
ease one person's suffering, this 
measure will add another a;ldict to 

of lthel drug for illegal purposes." 
Proposition 215, however, includes 
no such safeguards. 

The initiative does explicitly 
say that it is not meant to condone 
the use of marijuana for non-medi-
cinal purposes. It will, however, 
make enforcement of current drug 
laws more dinicull. It will clog the 
courls as a new gray area of legal 
use is explored. 

But so what if there are loop-
holes? So what if people use them 
to get or use drugs, which I earlier 
said shou ld be legalized anyway? 
Because we live in a democratic 
society based on the rule of law, 
obeying the law is the responsibili -
ty of all citizens. We must follow 
the laws, even if we do not agree 
with them 

When we act to make the laws, 
by initiative, for example, we must

the already staggering number of

The last, and perhaps most 
important, detrimental effect of 
this measure is the message it 
would send to our youth. As 
Americans, we have always been 
taught to believe that our doctor, a 
well as our government, knows 
best. Therefore, if both our doctors 
and our government indicate that 
marijuana use is permissible under 
certain circumstances, it would 
further undermine current ellorts 
to keep chi ldren off drugs.

November. it will not be because 
the measure has any true merit 
beyond providing relief for the ter-
minally ill. It will be because the

work in good faith . While there are 
many people who support 
Proposition 215 out of compassion 
for the sick, those who wrote it 
acted in bad faith . It would have 
been easy to write a measure that 
did not contain loopholes, that tar-
geted the people who can legiti-
mately use medical marijuana. 

Instead, Proposition 2 15's pro-
ponents hijacked a good cause and 
wrote a bad law. This is the core 
problem. People can be helped by 
marijuana, hut this initiative is not 
the way to do it. While I feel that 
drugs should be broadly legalized, 
it must be done in the open. rather 
than under the guise of compassion 
for the sick. 

We must not reward those who

I was pleased to read the recent 
article about UCSD's new admis-
sions policy ("UCSD Drafts New 
Admissions Policy," Guardian, 
Sept. 30, 1996), It is important, 
though, to stress a few unmen-
tioned poi nts in the article. 

First, UCSD's admissions poli-
cy committee does have an under-
graduate student representative that 
is there to e)l;press the concerns and 
viewpoints of students. It is not just 
faculty and administration . 
. Second, the admissions policy 
that was recommended by the com-
millee is not in .its final form yet. 
There are still a few months before 
a complele and final draf! is pre-
sented to the UC Office of the 
President. 

Weekly meetings are current ly 
under way to discuss and shape the 
policy a little more, But, in essence, 
the breakdown of admissions will 
remain as before - 60 perc~nL of 
those admitted will be accepted 
based on academic criteria alone, 
and about 40 percent will be admit-
ted on a combination of academic 
and supplemental criteria. 

Student input and thoughts on 
this mailer are encouraged. 
Students can reach me at 534-4450.

of this group and came to UCSD 
just to attend this concert. 

") love dancing to their music 
but their records are pretty hard 
to get .... she said. " ) had one 
shipped over from France so ( ' m 
really excited about that." 

Though the Untouchables have 
been associated with ska music, 
Jerry Miller, the lead singer, pre-
fers to have their music thought 
of as dance music wi th a message 
behind it. 

" We compose ninety-five per-
cent of all the songs we play," 
Mi lIer said. " We're fans of all 
types of music and playa variety 
of di ffe rent styles." 

" It is also exciting that groups 
like No Doubt and Sublime have 
referred to us as an influence in 
interviews." he added . " M ore 
people are hearing about us." 

Though the crowds were small , 
Mi Il er loved playing for the 
UCSD audience and felt an en-
ergy in the people who allended. 

" It was great to play for UCSD 
because there was a qual i ty almo-
sphere presen t," M i lIer said. " It ' s 
always brighter and more posi -
ti ve when we play for a college 
audience." 

Ska is a mix of reggae and 
rock mu sic sty les, wilh an em-
phasis on horn s and the keyboard . 

N ajera said. " Ska is an exce l -
lent genre of music and has not 
gotten the attention it deserved 
from the mainstream unt i l j ust 
recently ." 

The Grass Ninjas. who opened 
the show. is a local band from 
Encini tas. They have played at 
the Che Cafe and have opened for 
the Iron BUllerflies. The group 
was named the M agic Viewing 
Patch preYiously and have a new 
identity now as the Grass Ninjas. 

Nate Young, the lead bass 
player of the Grass Ninjas who i 
a sophomore at Revelle College. 
said the group practices once a 
week . 

"We incorporate many genres 
of musk," he said . " But, the 
crowd's favori te is always ' 1 Will 
Survive' by Gloria Gainor he-
cause we do a sing along to thaI 
song." 

A relatively new band . the 
Grass Ninjas have been together 
for about two months. 

" W e have been jamming for 
about two yea rs now bul we are 
just now trying to develop a fol -
lowing," Young sa id . 

When a ked about how the 
band felt about opening for the 
Untouchables, Reed answered 
posi tively. 

"I think the Untouchables are 
cool; incethey played aS ly Stone 
ong, they are alright with me," 

he said . "It wa great opening for 
them and I feel pretty good about 
i l. "

Hello Earthlings! 
It's Gretchen again, your friendly 

on-campus restaurant reviewer. I 
thought I'd tell you a wee bit 
about myself today. As you 
may have already guessed, 
I'm not from this world. I 
come from the sixth planet 
from the'sun in the seventeenth universe! En route to my 
cooking show on planet Zog, my cruiser was sucked into a 

tIme-space warp envelope, and Voila! I was on planet Earth, in southern India. 

While adjusting to the new atmosphere and climate in India, I 
decided to attend a circ~s.. I happened upon a saddened trapeze 
artist named Side Dish 'Bob who had broken his big toe in a 
frightful trapeze accident, ending his phenomenal trapeze career. 
We decided that h~ and his Roman .appetite should accompany 
me around the globe on a tasty journey. We travelled the world 
over before stopping here at good 01' UCSD. Great picture, don'~ 
you think? 

Lucky for you, we've tried just about every fantabulous yum-yum available at 
UCSD! Let me tell ·You a little about the delectible decisions you'll have to make. 

Aye aye aye, the came asada tacos at La Casa take me back to the days Bob 
and I spent in Baja soaking up the sun. Then there's the Pacific Rim cuisine 

at Club Med and 'Plaza Cafe. All those great dishes remind me of the 
luncheon we were ser~ed at the Bonsai Convention in Japan. After 

the convention, Bob and I travelled to Easter Island where we had 
ourselves a lovely picnic lunch. Don't tell Bob I said this, but I 

really thfnk those yummy made-to-order deli and submarine 
sandwiches at the Rathskeller and Oceanview are even better 

than the ones Bob made for our picnic. 

Dh my goodness me, I'm getting so hungry! But I must 
tell you about the time Bob fell off the gondola in Venice. 

We found out that pasta sticks to more than just walls. And the pizza 
tQssing in the p~k in Sicily ... boy, was that a disaster. Bob tells me those 
savory pastas and pizzas at C~nyon Vista alway~ remind him of those 
good 01' days. . 

But if you're looking for a quIck pick-me-up, snack, or snappy meal 
you should travel right on over to Earl's Place or the Munch Box or 

. , 

let Dining Express come to you! I think they might be faster than the 
Alikazzam Meal Machine I had on my cruiser. Please make me stop! 
I could go on for days, but I'll have to wait fO'r the next edition of the 
Guardian. See you then! 

Love, 

[$.t:etchen

....

Hdapting to life at UCSD can be quite a transition from the or high school 
~ears, and the difficult conversion o"en gives rise to bad habits 

earken back to those halcyon days 
of yesteryear - you know, back 
when you were in high school. 
Seems like ages ago, huh? 

Back then , your en tire grade in 
a class wasn't dependent on a 

midterm and a final. You didn't have 20-
page term papers that were assigned two 
months ahead of time and required 
extensive research. You were in classes with 
the same people for an entire year. 
Remember that? 

For a lot of students, the college 
environment is a brave new world, one in 
which the e old high school days are nothing 
more then a memory. And differences abound 
not merely on the academic side, but almost 
everywhere imaginable. Indeed, for many 
people college offer a new level of 
responsibility that could only be imagined 
during high school. And nobody is more 
aware of these realities than the students 
themselves, who have had to weather the 

and home for the first time can 
be exhilarating, but it can be rough, too. 
The basics that students had so long been 
taking for granted suddenly become more 
complicated. 
Student Diet 

Besides adapting to the obvious scholastic 
differences. college presents another 
challenge - for those living in the dorms, it 
means building up iron innards to withstand 
that insidious dining hall chow. For others 
living in apartments and houses, it means 
developing the patience to learn how to 
prepare exquisite cuisine beyond the 
standard cinnamon toast and microwave 
pizza fare. Either way, it's a tough situation 
to tomach. 

The dining halls do offer the advantage of 
eliminating the hassle of food preparation. On 
the other hand. you are at the mercy of their 
limited menu, and the hours they keep can be 

constricti ng. 
"[The di ning halls] aren't bad,'" Revelle 

fre hman Barbera Otrubova said. Otrubova 
enjoys the good fortune of dining at the 
Revelle Plaza Cafe every night. "It's a lot of 
fast · food, like burgers and burritos. It's like 
goi ng to a restaurant every night." 

But without Mom to look over your 
shoulder and monitor consumption of the four 
food groups, eating nutritiou Iy can get pretty 
hairy. For too many students, the four food 
groups become pizza, Ben & Jerry's Ice 
Cream, Lucky Charms and Juice Club-type 
beverage . 

"A lot of [the food] is unhealthy so I 

understand the weight gain ["freshman IS"]," 
Otrubova added. "Still, the food's better than 
in elementary chool." 

Fortunately, there are multiple eateries on 
campus that offer a wide variety of slop. But 
no mailer where you go, the meatloaf will 
probably never be as good as when Mom 
makes it at home. 
Cooking 

On the bright side, there eventually comes 
a time for every freshman to graduate from 
dorm food and move on to the real te t -
cooking for yourself, 

Don 't get too excited, freshmen . A lot of

HABITS: 
Adjustment to 
college life difficult 
Continued from ..... 16 
people who hit this stagc end up 
yearning for donn food again. 

In theory, the abili'ty to cook 
your own meals offers many 
tempting possibilities. You can eat 
whatever you willi, whenever you 
want it. In practice, however, the 
luster of these advantages can wear 
off prelly quickly once cold 
realities set in. 

The annoying side effects that 
are ine)(tricably linked to making 
what you want to eat -
preparation time and the added 
irritation of washing pots and 
dishes, to name I few - hardly 
make the effort seem wonh it, 
especially if you're just cooking 
enough for yourself. This added 
hassle precipitates eating out all the 
time, which translates to junk food 
and big bucks spent. 

"My Mom was the best cook in 
the world," Wanen junior T.J . 
D'Amalo said, fondly recalling his 
home-grown days. "Now I'm 
eating oul seven days a week." 

The ideal situation is to split 

and 
you 
that 

ask,. 
either 
Grace or 
Dan. 
Call •• 
and _ake 

cooking chores with roommates if 
possible. 

"A lot of the time, if someone is 
making something, they'll ask 
everyone else if they want some:.' 
said Muir Junior Dinh Nguyen of 
his apartment's cooking 
camaraderie . 

However, clashing class 
schedules often make planning 
meals nearly impossible. 

And then there's that other 
factor that invariably makes your 
cooking come up soon every time 
- the unavoidable comparison to 
Mom's. 

"Here's the concept: when I 
cook I can't get everything done at 
the same time," D' Amato 
lamented. "My mom can make 
chicken, rice, vegetables and 
homemade bread, and iI's all ready 
to eat at the same time. 

"When I cook, it's done in 
steps. The chicken's done .- I'll 
eat it. Then the vegetables are 
done, and I'll eat them. It 's never 
done at once so I can eat a real 
meaL"

on an easy, consistent schedule that 
you could follow every day.

typically due the day after they 
were assigned, facililating an easy 
study schedule that eventuated in a 
routine. And 10 keep you from 
slacking off, parents' watchful eyes 
served as a safety -valve that 
prevented you from gelling 100 
complacent. 

Now: College classes are on 
irregular Monday-Wednesday-
Frid ay /Tuesd ay -Th u rsday 
schedules. Homework is assigned 

@ 

by the week or long-term, 
promoting the downfall of many a 
college student. Nobody 's around 
to make sure you ' re on top of your 
studies c)(cept you. 

"I miss having a regular 
schedule." Otrubova said of her 
collegiate classes. "During high 
school you had everything during 
the day and then you had your 
nights free. Here you have a lot 
of lime here and there and you're 
on your own to get everything 
done." 

As a number of students have 
found, the old high school study 
habits do not always translate 
successfully to college. Work 
assigned on a longer-term basis 
often prompts many to - surprise! 
- procrastinate. 

"The one thing that was 
different [in high school] was that 
I couldn't get out of studying at 
home, because my mom and dad 
were like Hitler," Marshall junior 

, Mike Robens said. "When I got 
here, my first quarter classes 
were so easy that I didn't need to 
study, and I fell out of the habi t. 
But when my classes got hard and 
I needed to study later, I 
couldn '!." 

II doesn'l help that Ihc 

. '" 

FEATURES 17 

dorm/apartment environment 
frequently promotes studying 
about as vigorously as 
McDonald' promoles a 
vegetarian diet. Life in the 
resident halls more closely 
resembles a year-long lumber 
pany than a studious atmosphere. 

"It's a 101 harder to study here," 
said Otrubova, "With 10 people in 
a suite it can get pretty loud." 

When you are living with your 
friends, who wants to study when 
you can socialize, anyway? 

"I don't get any studying done 
at my apartment, because my 
roommates and I would rather do 
stuff together than do work," 
Marshall senior Shanley Miller 
said. 
Transition Complete 

By their seni.or years, most 
students have finally managed to 
make the final adjustments from 
high school to college. Of course, 
just when you think you ' re out of 
the woods, you end up having to 
undergo another change: 

"What about when you have to 
move back horne?" senior Dave 
Sen a said. '''Then you can't smoke 
and drink anymore. You can' t do 
your usual diny habits that you 
developed hcre."

Road Proves Kind Once More 
PACK YOUR BAGS: The mega-mileage Tritons headed north to take care ofDiv. III rival La Verne 

By Steve Walsh 
Co Associate Sports Editor 

If the CA A made its rankings 
based on the number of miles 
travel ed,the UCSD women's vo l-

leyball team would 
be number one by a 
huge margin . 

Aftertrips to Min-
nesota, Pomona, San 
Bernardi no and 
Santa Barbara, Tri -
ton Head Coach 
Duncan McFarland 

and his team have found a com-
fortable homeilway from home by 
logging thousands of miles on the 
road. In the process, the Tritons 
have put together a showing that 
should position them as one of the 
teams to heat in the po tseason . 

. Once again the team packed its 
bags, piled into the vans and 
headed north, this time to do battle 
with Division III rival La Verne 
University. The Leopards pre-
sented an unknown factor for the 
Tritons because the two teams had 
never crossed paths. 

Unknown or not, the Tritons 
entered the match looking to get 
back on track after a tough loss to 
Westmont earlier in the week. The 
squad was successful, winning the 

matc~ in four games. 
"We got another good win on 

the road," McFarland said, "Jt 
seem like we're always getting 
into the vans to head somewhere 
and then getting home late." 

With a strong display of hitting 
and blocking, UCSD made sure 
that there would be no surprises 
inside the unusual , big-top, tent-

versity. The frontline of the Tri-
tons put together another impres-
sive display on both offense and 
defense, with sophomore outside 

advantage of her opportunity to 
play the entire match by racking 
up a team high 20 kills. 

hiller Dana Saller 
making full use of

match," McFarland said, "She has 
been in and out of the lineup for 

her playing time Volley Smash •••

and has been ag-
gressi ve off the 
bench. " 

Joining Saller 
up front were 
s talwarls 
Madelyn Ripken, 

Mieke Bicsheuve l, Chrisline Chi 
and hannon oonan, who each 
put up doublc fig ures for kill s and 
hclped record 24 blocks. Sherine 
Ebadi , a converted outside hitter. 
continued her trong play at the 
seller position, di shing out 52 as-
sists and firing numerous lough 
jump serves throughout the malch. 

Despite the i mpressi ve stats, it 
. look the Tritons four games to di s-

patch of their rivals from the north 
and left UCSD with areas on which 
to improve before Ihe team enjoys 
a much-deserved homestand _ 
Game two in particular revealed 
the Achilles heel for the Tritons: 
their failure to consistently close 
out a tight game. 

Up 14-12 and playing for game 
point , UCSD stumbled and al -
lowed the Leopards 10 claw back 
into the game and eventually win , 
16-14. 

"A a leam, we still have times 
where we slip into sloppy play," 
McFarland said, "We need to be 
steadier and have more focus, but 
we ' re doing what ' s needed towin." 

Thankfully for both the team 
and the coaches, the Tritons' next 
match will only require a short 
drive east to EI Cajon to face Chris-
tian Heritage --"- a tough squad 
with good height, thanks to the 
con version of basketball players 
10 the volleyball team. 

Following that match, the 
team finally gets to reacquaint 
it self with the friendly confines 
of RIMAC as they host two im-
portant matches againsl 
Chapman University and 
Tuseulum (TN) College .

Jersey Gents Stop Winning Streak RATS: Vannin~ are not allowed anymore ice time 
Continued from pille 24 GOLDEN STATE: New Jersey's top-ranked squad, Richard Stockton College, came to town 

and ended UCSD's nine-game winning streak with a 2-1 victory, dropping the Tritons to 9-3 After fi nding a dead rat in the locker room, the Panthers went on a miraculous 
run through the season and playoffs, 
taking them all the way to the 1996 
Stanley Cup. Was the rat good luck? The 
players thought so, and so did the fans. 
Thousands of Aorida faithful caught Rat 
Fever. 

By Nicole Va".s 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

When one th inks of New Jersey, Atlantic 
City, toll booths. the shore and the New 
Jersey Jets come to mind. But a top-ranked 

soccer team? 

Kosakoff and Wes Roberts thaI gave the 
crowd at the TriLOn Soccer Stadium a rea-
son to yell. But the Stockton team still 
managed to get by the defense, and gain a 
lillie momentum in the process. 

Richard Stockton College 
boasts the best men 's soccer 
squad in the Garden State, 
and is among the LOp five 
Division III teams in the na-
tion. 

The Ospreys had only three attempts on 
goal. which says quite a bit for the UCSD 
defensive effort. Unfortunately, Sn>ckton 
converted two of those three auempts into 
points. 

When the Ospreys trav-
eled 10 San Diego last Friday 

night, the UCSD men' s soccer team knew 
they were facing a tough team. 

Stockton's game built up over time in 
the first half, and with a minute left. Jim 
Connor placed a lob header out of sopho-
more goalkeeper Charles Le vinson's reach, 
for the 1-0 lead. 

Maybe too toug h. The Tritons were 
unable to overcome Stock lon College. 
falling 2- 1 to end thei r nine-game win-
ning streak . 

The cards were stacked agai n t UCSD 
from th e sta rt. Senior forward Nate 
Hetherington was suffering from slomach 
flu, and left Ihe field in the fi r t half tempo-
rarily due to illness. 

" I Ihink we were ready for (Richard 
SlocktonJ," H etherington said. " We j ust 
didn ' t realize how good of a learn Ihey 
really were." 

Al so. Ihe Trilons hadn ' l played a game 
sincc Iheir 3- 1 v iclory over Chapman on the 
road la I weekend, and at limes they looked 
a lillie ru sl y. 

"A week is a long lime off," sa id Trilon 
A ssistenl Coach Ted Przyby lek. " You lose 
your rhylhm, and thaI can 'hurl a learn ."

Hetherington, who started slowly, be-
gan to show hi s stuff in the second half. 
running up the right with his trademark 
speed. This, however. didn' t deter the 
Stockton team, who put a second ball past 
the weary Levinson, bringing the score to 
2-0. 

" We were ready and we knew it would be 
tough." Roberts said. " ( think we had a lack 
of concentration." 

The word " unlucky" best described the 
usually high-scoring UCSD offense. De-
spite shots on goal from every direction, the 
Tritons were unable to con vert all that ac-
tion into tallies. 

Forwards Hetherington, Chris Fong, 
John Brandon, Jose Ocampo and midfielder 
Brian Turner looked as if they may have a 
chance at the goal, but only one combina-
ti on proved successful late in the game. 

In ,he 79th minute, Fong converted a 
Turner assist into a goal, preventing a pos-
sible shutout by the 0 preys and closing in 
on the Stockton lead. 2- 1. 

The Triton rall y proved to be too lillie, 
too late, Fong 's score may have recharged 
the team, but the clock ran out with the 
squad a goal short. 

" We were so energized .• " Roberts said. 
"We thought we could come back and 
maybe tie up the game and put it i~ over- , 
t ime." 

The loss bri ngs the Triton record to 9-3, 
but the leam looks to return to their winning 
ways today when they take on Th'e Master' 
College at 3:30 p.m. at Triton Soccer Sta-
dium. 

Following the discovery of the rigor 
. monis rat, any time the Panthers scored a 
goal, hundreds of rubber rats were tlung 
onto the ice by fans in celebration. The 
rodents caused such a stir that play was 
often delayed for up to 15 minutes. The 
disruption was instrumental in the 
Panthers' upset of the powerful Pittsburgh 
Penguins in the Eastem Finals. 

Rat Fever was good for the Florida 
economy, too, as Orkin Pest Control 
caught the vermin virus. Cashing in on the 
epidemic, event staff would dash out onto 
the ice. dre sed in full Orkin uniform, and 
pick up all the rubber rats and toss them 
into buckets with the Orkin logo on them. 
Utter commercial pandemonium I 

Although the Panthers ended up losing 
the cup in four to the upstart Colorado 
A valanche, Rat Fever possessed Miami 
like no other plague. And now? The righl 
to contract the disease has been taken 
away b¥ the cruel executives of the NHL. 

Listen up, all ye hockey faithful : don't 
let the league supress your freedom! It is 
the fan ' s God-given right to to s any 
object he sees fit onto the ice, I it fear of 
injuring the player ? Hey, iI'S a conlact 
sport - players should be alert anyway. 
My solution to the whole ordeal is to 
throw whatever you want: rats, quid or 
any other mollusk. Now, just be sure you 
aim for the referees.

Feel the Squeeze 

Now that Guardian readers 
are versed on the ins and outs of 
the great game of hockey, it is 
time to deal with the real issues 

j • that confroDtthe average fan. ] 
myself am a great supporter of 
the game, despite the fact that 
my former team, the Los 
Angeles Kings, has lost sight of 
what it takes to put a champion-
ship team on the ice. But that 's 
another story. 

The real issue today is the 
recent amendment to the rule 
book that the tyrannical NHL's 
front office has enacted. I speak, 
of course, of the new rule 
banning any object from being 
thrown onto the ice during the 
course of the game. Violation of 
this new rule result in a bench 
minor penalty being assessed to 
the home team.

Feeling Blue 
DOMINATING: UCSD women's soccer has yet 
to surrender a goal in their six wins this season 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

It was a weekend getaway for two 
squads from Minnesota. Two Saints 
- SI. Thomas and SI. Benedict -

decided to leave the 
land of 1000 lakes and 
take thei r chances in 
the Golden State. The 
UCSD women's soc-
cer team, howcIler, 
was not very ho pi-
table 10 the Minneso-
tans, recording back-

Io-back shutouls of SI. Benedict and 
SI. Thomas, 2-0 and 3-0 respectively. 
The Tritons have now outscored lheir 
opponents44-3 inthe I 996campaign, 
recording nine shutouts on the_way. 

keep UCSD's offensive juggernaul al 
bay. The final statistics were a mirror 
of the Blazers' strategy. The Tritons' 
100ai of six shots forth" game is below 
their average, but on Ihis night it wa 
six more than the Blazers accumu-
lated. 

"l Saturday J night was a terrible 
game to play," Trilon Head Coach 
Brian McManus said, 'They howed 
u right from the tart what they were 
goi ng to do. They kicked off and ran 
backwards. They had everyone back 
- all 10. They were nol even going 10 
bother with scoring."

This should have true fans in 
uproar - we all know that this 
sovereign right of the fan should 
be upheld al all costs. Our right 
10 hur1 any object we see fit onto 
Ihe ice is a perfect example of 
freedom of expression. The only 
projectile Ihe league permits 
thrown on the ice are the 
traditional array of caps that end 
.lIP on the rink following a hat 
Irick. OK, fine, so there is an 
exception for the ordinary. 

In Saturday nighl 's affair versu 
SI. Benedict, the Tritons had a tough 
go of it, as the conservative. defensive 
play of the Bears kept the game score-
less going inlo the half, For the whole 
contest, alii 0 players-remained on SI. 
Benedict's half of the field, hoping to 

SI. Benedict goaltender Li aGrefe 
was outstanding in net, kccping her 
squad in the game. But her luck ran 
out at the 65: 15 mark when UCSD 
finally got on the board. Chri ta 
Wemmer's shol amid a crowded box 
was initially stopped, but junior for-
ward Lauren Johnson punched the 
loose rebound into the back of the net 
for a 1-0 lead. Johnson's goal was her 
13th of the season, lOps on the squad. 

Rubbing Elbows: Co-Captain Kelly Kramer and the rest of the 
Tritons dominated St. Thomas in the air, winning 3-0 in overtime. 

But what about the surreal?

ers had no hope of 
scoring. 

The Tritons had no time to cel-
ebrate, however. as they squared off 
with the Tommies of Sl. Thomas, 
Sunday morning at II a.m. UCSD 
took charge of the contest in the fir~t 
half, keeping possession of the ball 
for most of the first 45 minutes. The 
Tritons took 10 shots and six comer 
kicks compared to St. Thomas' zeros 
in both categories. 

With the score knotted at nil after 
the first half, McManus' squad was 
sure to score in the next half, but once 

again UCSD could not put the ball 
past Tommy goalie Angie Folch. 
Folch received help from her ~tar 
sweeper, Dawn Peterson, who seemed 
to be involved in every play. 

The Tritons opened the overtime 
period with a.flurry of offensive runs, 
hoping to wear down the Tommies' 
midfielders and defenders. This strat-
egy finally paid off at the 94:44 mark 
when Alison Hurley received a sweet 
pass from Ele Johnson, corralled the
