UCSD’s Vice Chancellor – Business 
Affairs Steve Relyea will leave his 
position to become the executive vice 
chancellor and chief financial officer of 
the California State University system 
on May 1.

Relyea has worked in various 
business positions in the UC system 
for almost 40 years, including a 28-year 
stint at UCSD. He will be in charge of 
the Division of Business and Finance 
at his new post.

In a March 12 statement, CSU 
Chancellor Timothy P. White 
expressed the hope that Relyea will 
help the university system meet the 
needs of the state’s students.

“I am delighted that Steve is 
joining the CSU,” White said. “He is a 
champion for public higher education, 
and his campus-based experience is 
complemented by participation with 
many system-wide initiatives in the 
UC, such as chairing the task force 
to redesign the UC administrative 
framework.”

CSU’s Board of Trustees will 
confirm Relyea’s appointment at a 
meeting this month.

The transportation referendum 
will no longer be on the Spring 
Quarter Week 2 election ballot 
after the University of California 
Office of the President returned the 
referendum with feedback for policy 
changes that cannot be made before 
the filing deadline. A.S. Council, the 
Graduate Student Association and 
the Chancellor’s Office will amend 
and vote on the referendum language 
for the third time before it can appear 
on a ballot for UCSD students.

In response to the feedback from 
UCOP, policy and clerical changes 
will be made but will not affect the 
price or services included in the 
referendum, which is $49 per student 
per quarter for universal bus access in 
the San Diego area. 

Graduate Student Association 
President Rahul Kapadia thinks 
universal bus access will be beneficial 
to students who rely on buses for 
transportation because they will 
no longer be restricted to selecting

Slate Budgets Limited for 
Rare Two-Slate Election

The 2014 General Election is marked by involuntary spending limits per 
slate, and for having only two slates running against each other. 

A.S. Council slates will face an $1,800 spending 
limit during elections Spring Quarter 2014. The 
policy is new this year and compulsory for all slates, 
although all but one of the slates last year accepted 
voluntary spending limits.

The limit includes $250 per officer on the slate 
and $100 per senator. Most of the $1,800 will 
be spent on creating campaign materials, such as 
posters, T-shirts and stickers.

According to current Vice President of Finance 
Sean O’Neal, the limits were enacted so that no 
student could buy the election.

The slates’ budgets come primarily from personal 
contributions from the candidates themselves. 
Neither A.S. Council nor college council candidates 
are allowed to raise money from outside sources, 
with the exception of immediate family members. 
Candidates are also not allowed to use any A.S.

NEW CAMPAIGN SPENDING LIMITS
 BY ALEKSANDRA KONSTANTINOVIC 

ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR
Candidates for the 2014–15 A.S. Council positions 

officially launched their campaigns on March 6 with 
just two slates in the running. Unlike most previous 
elections, where multiple slates ran against each other, 
members of the Tritons Forward and Let’s Act! slates will 
be the only ones competing for their respective offices 
this year. 

Leading the Let’s Act! platform as its A.S. presidential 
candidate, Kyle Heiskala has worked with numerous 
campus organizations in the past, including UCSD 
MOVES and the Student Sustainability Collective. 
Heiskala recognizes the potential of UCSD’s student 
government to impact the school overall.

“I feel very privileged in that I know how the 
administration works and that I can make things 
happen,” Heiskala said. “I wanted to form this slate to 
make permanent, tangible changes. I’m very passionate 
about social and environmental justice.”

Council funds in the election.
Let’s Act! presidential candidate Kyle 

Heiskala believes the spending limits will 
only moderately impact how his slate 
campaigns.

“We’re going to be limited in the materials 
of outreach we can use this year as opposed 
to previous years,” Heiskala said. “However, I 
don’t think it’s too big a problem that we need 
to be more wise in the materials we use.”

Robby Boparai, the Tritons Forward 
presidential candidate, believes the spending 
limits will be an overall benefit in the election.

“I’m not worried because I want to 
concentrate on campaigning on Library Walk,” 
Boparai said. “I think by engaging students, we 
can allow for connections that will eventually 
make for better student leaders.”

Voting begins on Tritonlink on April 7 
and runs through April 11.

A March 6 editorial 
about affirmative action 
unfairly implied that 
race-based quotas 
would necessarily be 
present in admissions 
if SCA-5 passes the 
legislature. Although the 
policy will base admis-
sions in part on race, 
there will not officially 
be any quotas.

According to Heiskala, Let’s Act! will 
focus on “stepping outside the normal 
routine” to address the issues that are 
most important to the student body 
and having the best campaign possible. 
The slate’s election page further notes 
that it plans to work on campus 
sustainability, improved transportation 
and office accountability. Along with 
Heiskala, Let’s Act! members include 
Jehoan J. Espinoza for vice president 
campus affairs, Eden Esther Berdugo 
for vice president external affairs and 
Tristan Britt for vice president finance 
and resources.

On the opposing side, Robby 
Boparai heads the Tritons Forward 
slate as its presidential candidate and 
is currently serving as associate vice 
president of academic affairs. Tritons 
Forward bears the slogan, “Rise Up, 
Move Forward,” emphasizing “reform, 

innovation, spirit and empowerment.” 
It seeks to effectively manage the 
A.S. budget and hear the voices of all 
students on campus. Other members 
on the platform include Amber Jean 
Hawthorne for vice president campus 
affairs, Allyson Osorio for vice 
president external affairs and Igor 
Geyn for vice president finance and 
resources. 

Boparai is excited to run against 
a single slate this year and has great 
faith in his fellow candidates.

“We have a good group on both 
sides,” Boparai said. “It’s going to 
attract more people to vote because 
it mirrors the U.S. and California 
politics. It allows for people not 
to get confused and see clearly the 
different values of the two groups.”

Elections for every A.S. position, 
as well as the college councils, will 
take place in Week 2 of Spring 
Quarter 2014, from April 7 to April 

11, on Tritonlink. The winning 
presidential candidate will pick his 
cabinet shortly after. 

Current A.S. President Andy 
Buselt, who ran on the Keep it 
REAL slate last year, recalls his own 
campaigning experience as complex 
and draining.

“It’s a pretty crazy process,” Buselt 
said. “But it will be a very different 
feel across campus this year since 
we’re used to seeing a number of 
different slates [...] I would say [to 
both candidates]: ‘Remember your 
reasons for running and stay true 
to those. It will get tiring, but if you 
are genuine, it will all be worth it in 
the end.’”

A.S. Presidential Candidates Excited For Two-Slate Race

housing located along only a few bus 
lines. GSA passed the referendum for 
a second time with a vote of 41–1–0 
on Monday, March 10. 

“The language is much better than 
the old referendum language because 
it’s much more specific,” Kapadia 
said. “If a majority of students have 
concerns about the fee, the fee will 
not pass, but right now I’m feeling 
like there’s a good chance the fee will 
pass.”

The referendum will now be put 
to a special election which could 
potentially take place as soon as Week 

8 of Spring Quarter. This would mean 
that the finalized language would 
need to be approved by A.S. Council 
in Week 1.

“I’m always concerned about voter 
burnout because I know that it’s a real 
thing,” ASUCSD Moves Executive 
Director Kyle Heiskala said. “At the 
same time, I think this is an issue 
that affects all students in one way or 
another, so I think that we will get a 
turnout.”

Though the referendum was 
originally set to be voted on in a 
special election during Winter 
Quarter 2014, it was moved to 
the Spring Quarter 2014, Week 2 

general election due to concerns 
about the language’s vagueness from 
the Chancellor’s Office; now, due 
to the feedback from UCOP, it will 
potentially be moved to a special 
election later during spring quarter. 
However, Heiskala is optimistic and 
happy with the referendum. 

“We tried to get it on the Week 2 
timeline, and we were very aggressive 
with our efforts,” Heiskala said. 
“Despite the fact that it’s been delayed, 
I am still personally very proud of the 
work that has gone into it.”

Last night’s council meeting 
began with the appointment of 
Austin Peters and Aakash Bharani 
as campus-wide senators. Kyle 
Heiskala then gave an update on 
the transportation referendum: Due 
to changes that need to be made, 
it will not make it onto the general 
election — instead, it will likely 
be voted on in a 
special election 
during Week 8 of 
Spring Quarter 
2014.

CALPIRG 
Campus Organizer Alex Acuna 
then gave a presentation to help 
students manage their finances. 
During a short technical difficulty 
pause, we got a taste of Acuna’s 
dancing skills to Donna Summers’ 
“She Works Hard for the Money.”

The presentation itself was short 
but informative, and hopefully, 
CALPIRG will be able to educate 
a wider student audience on this 
important issue. We college stu-
dents certainly need to be more 
informed … at least, I do … please 
don’t make me grow up.

VP Student Life Linda Le 
announced that this year’s pan-
cake breakfast will have new items 
such as fruit salad, so come out 
since you’ve already spent a dollar 
on it anyways. Le then made an 
announcement about Triton Day 
and called it “the day that UCSD is 
Disneyland.” Not quite, but okay.

Council then passed the “Spread 
the Word to End the Word” resolu-
tion, a campaign to end the usage of 
the word “retard(ed)” in regards to 
people without the mental illness.

Physical Sciences Senator Sierra 
Donaldson reported that there was 
a very low attendance to her event 
discussing women in physical sci-
ences on Monday. She asked coun-

cil members to support each other 
in their projects and implored sena-
tors to use their final five weeks to 
complete senator projects.

As a whole, the meeting went 
by so fast that council members 
seemed unsure of what to do with 
themselves. They kept reorder-
ing back and forth between Open 

Forum, Question 
Time and Reports 
of Committees. 

Muir Senator 
Matt Pavon told 
a fun story about 

randomly running into and chat-
ting with Chancellor Khosla and 
UC President Janet Napolitano.

Revelle Senator Soren Nelson 
then announced that Interim Vice 
Chancellor Student Affairs Alan 
Houston is being highly considered 
to be permanently appointed to the 
position. Nelson expressed concern 
that Houston does not represent 
student interests.

“He’d be disastrous for the stu-
dent experience on this campus,” 
Nelson said. “I think we should do 
everything in our power to make 
sure a better candidate is put in 
that position.”

Several councilmembers respond-
ed with snaps to these sentiments. 

On a similar note, Campuswide 
Senator Jordan Coburn is trying to 
find a way to hold administration 
accountable to listening to council.

For better or for worse, this is 
my last council column, and I sup-
pose now is as good a time as any 
to say that I secretly sometimes like 
writing it, a little, maybe.

Thank you to all of my faithful 
readers; the moments in which I 
discovered each of you were truly 
exciting moments. 

Good luck with finals, and have 
a great spring break!

With UC Irvine’s departure from the UC Student Association, we’re left 
wondering about the efficacy of the 
UCSA and whether the substantial 
funding that UCSD students pay for 
our school’s membership is actually 
getting us any returns and contribut-
ing to causes that we care about.

UCSA is essentially the UC 
equivalent to the United Nations, 
comprised of representatives from 
each of the campuses’ student govern-
ments. However, UC Irvine’s student 
council voted to withdraw last month 
due to what they labeled as gen-
eral inaction from the organization, 
which included not supporting the 
American Federation of State County 
and Municipal Employee workers’ 
strike and keeping mostly silent over 
Janet Napolitano’s appointment as UC 
President. While we’re not quite ready 
to suggest that UCSD withdraw from 
UCSA too, we agree to an extent that 
the organization needs to do more to 
address students’ concerns and enact 
some change. 

UCSD students pay $2 per person 
per year to be a part of UCSA, which 
adds up to over $45,000 across the 
student body — much more than the 
$28,000 UC Irvine spent yearly.

For that money, it’s unfortunate 

that most UCSD students don’t even 
know what UCSA is or if it’s doing 
anything to help students. We’d like to 
see more UCSA involvement here on 
campus, as well as cooperation within 
the organization’s leadership to cre-
ate more effective campaigns to carry 
out student interests. Otherwise, the 
thousands of dollars we send to UCSA 
might be better spent here on cam-
pus; for example, this money could 
help A.S. Concerts and Events close 
their budget deficit for Sun God— an 
event that provably improves UCSD’s 
campus climate and has an apparent 
manifestation on our campus. 

However, we hesitate to unequivo-
cally recommend severing ties with 
UCSA, because it would be a shame 
to see the UC schools divided. As 
230,000 students across 10 campuses, 
we have the potential to impact a great 
deal more than as standalone schools 
of about 20,000 individuals. And 
though we are exceptionally diverse in 
culture and ideology, there are issues 
that the majority of debt-ridden stu-
dents in their twenties can agree on.

The problem, of course, is the 
execution. To unite so many students 
under any one cause requires aware-
ness and strong leadership, as well as 
tangible results. If UCSA is able to do 
a better job mobilizing student activ-

ism and getting the powers-that-be to 
act on our concerns, we feel that their 
ideas and current plans might be a 
potent resource for the student voice. 

One such initiative is the Fund the 
UC campaign, which aims to lower 
tuition costs. By furthering the impact 
of its education campaigns on the 
effects of Prop. 13, UCSA can inspire 
student involvement over an issue we 
all feel quite strongly about. 

Another UCSA campaign that 
shows promise to deliver real change 
is IGNITE: Invest in Graduation, Not 
Incarceration, Transform Education. 
IGNITE focuses on several bills cur-
rently in the state legislature that 
seeks to reduce California’s prison 
population while tempering what 
activists characterize as the school-
to-prison pipeline of expelled high 
school students turning to crime. 
This month, students protested 
in support of the campaign, dem-
onstrating that real initiative can 
come out of UCSA’s influence.

Uniting UC students under inter-
campus leadership is a great idea 
— UCSA, unfortunately, has not 
lived up to the potential. We believe 
there’s still a chance for the organi-
zation to shape up and for UCSD 
students to become more actively 
involved in its initiatives. 

Challenge
Yourself: 
Take a 
CS Class

Long after starting my second pass enrollment, I still find myself checking UCSD’s 
schedule of classes to look at dif-
ferent courses offered. It’s kind of 
like the shopper’s remorse I always 
go through; I never fail to look at 
other options even after I’ve made 
my selections. In this case, I’m con-
vinced that by being an obsessive 
lurk on TritonLink for seats and 
an avid CAPE evaluations reader, 
I might luck out and find a bet-
ter section time or come across an 
interesting (or easy) class that I just 
have to take.

Last quarter, I was getting bored 
of taking the usual Eleanor Roosevelt 
College general education classes 
and decided to enroll in CSE11, 
the accelerated introductory Java 
programming course. As a com-
munication major who has learned 
how to tune out biology terms over 
time and dodged the Calculus bul-
let, I knew that the class would be 
a challenge. But I figured I’d always 
wonder about “what-if ” scenarios in 
my head if I never took the class and 
thought that maybe I’d actually really 
like programming. Coming from a 
family of computer scientists, I fig-
ured it was about time to see what 
the hype was all about.

Though I found myself burning 
out around Week 7, constantly tired 
and complaining about the hours I 
spent in the labs doing programming 
assignments during the weekends, 
I‘ve learned a lot and gained a deeper 
understanding and appreciation for 
the work that goes behind even the 
most basic of programs. I’ve even 
experienced some small wins after 
programming my Java Turtle to write 
my name and drawing a rotating, 
drag-able Mickey Mouse, all while I 
attempted to find friends and tutors to 
bombard with endless questions.

Now that the class is wrapping 
up and I’ve finished my last pro-
gramming assignment, it’s safe to 
say that I have little to no regrets. I 
probably won’t become a software 
developer in the future, and I’m 
even not sure if I’ll ever find myself 
in CS classes again, but I definitely 
appreciated taking a straightfor-
ward class that didn’t end with a 
12-page final paper. I’ve realized 
that the class was the breath of 
fresh air I needed. Somewhere, 
somehow, I found the willpower to 
make it to two 8 a.m. classes a week 
for an entire quarter.

Around this time of the quar-
ter, most of us are camping out at 
Geisel, so exhausted from complet-
ing projects and cramming for 
final exams that we’re hardly sane 
enough to make good decisions 
about which classes we should take 
next quarter. We’re usually short 
on sleep and cursing the day we 
chose to take an extra course, but 
I challenge you to take an intro-
ductory CS class to try something 
new. Whether you’re trying out a 
programming class out of genuine 
interest or if you’re just curious to 
find out what it’ll be like, having 
some knowledge and understand-
ing of coding will always be an asset 
in a world filled with so much new 
tech. Who knows — it might be 
really fun or rewarding, and maybe 
even help you become the next 
“Flappy Bird” millionaire.

Two-Slate Tango

 The smaller number of  slates in this year’s A.S. Council elections is a unique  
opportunity to increase voter turnout and encourage student involvement.

ILLUSTRATION BY JEFFREY LAU

Last Thursday, the two slates competing for representation on A.S. Council, Tritons Forward and Let’s Act!, publicly announced their candidates running for the student 
governing board. The stark contrast to the five slates that cam-
paigned for Council 2013–14 has made this year’s A.S. Council a 
bit more interesting, with the possibility for significantly improv-
ing voter turnout and student involvement with elections.

Library Walk may end up looking a little less colorful during 
election week, but having fewer slates affords Triton voters the 
rare opportunity to actually get to know the candidates run-
ning for A.S. Council. With a larger number of slates, it’s hard to 
expect students to remember who is who and, more importantly, 
what plans each candidate has for council. 

During last year’s election, with five different slates compet-
ing for attention, most students dreaded going anywhere on 

campus, annoyed because they couldn’t seem to get away from 
flyers and candidates attempting to start the campaign spiel 
en route to class. But now with limited competition, Tritons 
Forward and Let’s Act! will both have to campaign harder and 
more effectively to reach out to different communities on cam-
pus, as neither can rely on rallying only small specific groups of 
voters. A.S. Council elections have had an unimpressive voter 
turnout over the past few years, so hopefully candidates this year 
will reach out to students and encourage them to understand 
their views and go online to vote. 

Partisanship may be the main cause of trouble for the grid-
locked United States government, but on our campus, a two-
party election may be exactly what our student body needs to 
have a progressive and successful 2014–15 academic year. Both

UCSA Needs to Increase Its Campus Presence

Heiskala have proven track records 
of service to students and will soon 
become familiar names on campus 
because of their campaigning efforts, 
extensive flyering and front page 
Guardian coverage. With only two 
candidates leading slates in this elec-
tion period, each slate’s plans should 
become much clearer. We hope that 
the two-slate system will yield higher 
voter turnouts and ultimately more 
accountability for those who take 
office next quarter to stay true to 
their campaign goals.

We don’t see any obvious nega-
tive ramifications of a two-slate 
election, primarily because all 
candidates for ASUCSD essentially 

have a mandate to prioritize stu-
dent interests and work for the stu-
dents at UCSD. All A.S. candidates 
have a baseline level of common-
alities that will not differ across 
slate lines. For example, no seri-
ous candidate for ASUCSD would 
publicly endorse arbitrarily  raising 
tuition fees or call for an end to the 
Sun God Festival. All candidates 
need to openly support the major 
elements of support for current 
and future students: affordability, 
accessibility and diversity. So far, 
it seems that both Let’s Act! and 
Tritons Forward both support these 
ends on the necessary level.

What can differ between ASUCSD 
slates, though, is which services and 
initiatives that benefit students are 

prioritized. For example, a campaign 
to promote student spirit through 
higher attendance at athletic games is 
not inherently at odds with an initia-
tive to have campus shuttles run on 
clean energy. However, how much 
attention each candidate pays to each 
initiative can make the difference. 
The two-sided race Tritons will see 
next month will help the candidates 
set agendas that students approve of 
without alienating apathetic voters.

A two-slate election is just what 
our campus needs to get more 
involved in the election process. We 
hope that students bewildered by the 
myriad slates in the past feel more 
engaged with the candidates and 
actively vote to address their interests 
and improve our campus community.

FUNGLY By Kyle Trujillo LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Your piece on SCA-5 not only 

reproduces the myths and miscon-
ceptions surrounding affirmative 
action, but it also spreads fears with-
out understanding what SCA-5 could 
actually do. There is widespread 
misunderstanding of SCA-5 because 
of the strong anti-affirmative action 
propaganda that has been circulating 
far and wide by many conservative 
organizations. I’m here to unpack the 
language and rhetoric behind affir-
mative action/SCA-5.

I’ll start off with clarifying that 
SCA-5 does not use race-based 
quotas in admissions. Quotas are 
actually banned at the federal level. 
Using race as one of many factors 
when considering admissions is not. 
People think that there are a reserved 
number of seats for a certain class 
and race of students, but there aren’t. 
We need to reject the idea that affir-
mative action enables people of color 
to “steal” “our” spots because then 
we buy into this individualistic idea 
that higher education should only 
be accessible to those “deserving” 
students without truly understanding 
or challenging the way the system 
works and who it benefits.

This leads me to my next 
point — SCA-5/affirmative action 
does not give “preferential treat-
ment” to unqualified applicants. 
People have internalized this idea 
that SCA-5 will suddenly allow all 
minority applicants into California 
State Universities/Universities of 
California. The criteria for admis-
sions still exist and in no way are 
they changed to accommodate 
people of color. Affirmative action 
serves as a supplement, as it allows 
admissions officers to assess achieve-
ment levels given the unique expe-

riences, circumstances and life 
trajectories of minorities. Merit is 
still rewarded, just not merit in the 
terms that the system defines. It’s 
really insulting and racist for people 
to believe that blacks and Latinos are 
so unqualified for college that they 
need affirmative action to pay their 
ticket into the system — that is not 
the case. Affirmative action would 
allow for the achievements of these 
groups to be understood more clear-
ly through the consideration of race.

Lastly, SCA-5 is not racist or 
anti-Asian. The anti-Asian rheto-
ric is a tool used to rally Asian 
Americans to pit us against blacks 
and Latinos. This issue is not one 
that is us versus them, because 
higher education is for all of us. 
Please stop letting the language 
confuse you into thinking that. 
Increasing educational opportuni-
ties for people of color is not racist. 
You want to know what’s racist? 
The Compton Cookout. And all the 
racial micro-aggressions and racist 
Greek parties that constantly occur 
across all universities, probably due 
to the alarming lack of diversity. 
People cannot say they support 
diversity while standing against 
affirmative action. Not everyone 
has equal access to higher educa-
tion, and there are many highly 
qualified, yet underrepresented 
groups who need to be here with 
us. Blacks, Latinos and Southeast 
Asians aren’t even on the “playing 
field” because they struggle with 
overcoming the educational bar-
riers that put them at a significant 
disadvantage. There aren’t enough 
of these groups in higher education 
and I urge for you to actively sup-
port communities of color because 
that’s what fighting for educational 
equity looks like.

Two-Slate Election Helps Differentiate Candidates’ Stances



W es Anderson’s style has always been defined by his vintage aesthetic, thrift-store-like in 
its boldness, less a depiction of reality 
than a peek into a color-coordinated 
alternate dimension. Considering the 
simple plots that usually surround the 
charming characters in Anderson’s 
world, the narrative complexity at the 
start of his newest film, “The Grand 
Budapest Hotel,” is all the more com-
pelling.

Anderson frames the film 
around a writer known only as “The 
Author” (played as an older man by 
Tom Wilkinson and by Jude Law 
when he’s young), who has written 
the story of Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray 
Abraham), owner of the Grand 
Budapest Hotel. The story begins 
with Mr. Moustafa’s early years in 
the 1930s, when he was a young 
boy called Zero (Tony Revolori), 
employed as the luxury hotel’s 

“lobby boy” under the care of con-
cierge Mr. Gustave (a brilliant Ralph 
Fiennes). 

Luckily, Anderson doesn’t push 
the narrative intricacies too far, only 
utilizing “The Author” as a book-
end to transport the viewer into his 
strange world. The story revolves 
around Zero’s friendship with his 
employer. Gustave’s life is thrown 
into chaos when his long-term, part-
time lover, the opulent Madame D. 
(Tilda Swinton), dies suddenly. When 
Gustave inherits a priceless painting 
that belonged to Madame D., her 
envious family frames him for her 
murder.

The supporting cast screams “Wes 
Anderson,” and might be his finest 
thus far. Included in the menagerie 
is Madame D.’s family lawyer (the 
always-peculiar Jeff Goldblum), her 
conniving son (a delightfully fiendish 
Adrien Brody) and his hired assassin 

(Willem Dafoe), a surprisingly sadistic 
character for a Wes Anderson film.

The loyal Zero sets out with 
Gustave to prove him innocent, and 
despite the dark premise, the film 
quickly turns into a rollercoaster of 
hilarity and adventure, filled with 
visual gags and sublimely wry quips. 
Even Dafoe has a moment of hilarity 
involving a very unexpected feline 
defenestration.

If Anderson’s previous films 
have felt cartoonish, “The Grand 
Budapest Hotel” pushes even pre-
viously established standards. Yet 
despite the preponderance of ani-
mated backgrounds and transition 
scenes, the film never feels self-
indulgent. The actors’ performances 
are charming enough to justify the 
kitsch, and Anderson’s up-front atti-
tude about the inherent playfulness 
of his films makes the vibe work.

That’s not to say that this film 
merely relies on reusing old tech-
niques. Anderson also uses new 
methods, including varying screen 
resolutions and color tints to convey 
the film’s different time periods. And 
old techniques, such as Anderson’s 
characteristic use of tableaux vivants 
— painting-like still shots to begin 
scenes — is at its most dynamic, offer-
ing the audience a glimpse into the 
director’s cinematic dollhouse.

If “The Grand Budapest Hotel” 
has a fault, it might be that it contains 
a little less emotion than Anderson’s 
usual fare — a promising love affair 

between Zero and his young wife 
(Saoirse Ronan) takes a backseat to 
the scapegoat-murder storyline. It 
does attempt to quickly recuperate 
some poignancy towards its conclu-
sion, but removing the audience 
from the Anderson-verse might so 
suddenly feels a little jarring and 
prevents it from being as satisfying as 
his previous films, such as “The Royal 
Tenenbaums.”

But it’s foolish to obsess over 
comparisons, considering that eight 

films later, Wes Anderson’s style 
remains as fresh and interesting as 
ever. Critics will still criticize his 
filmography as excessively whimsi-
cal, but it’s hard to care when you’re 
enraptured by Fiennes’ brilliantly 
bold performance throughout the 
mouth-watering aesthetic of this 
vibrant adventure.

U sually, when college graduates are dealing with uncertainty, it has to do with finding a job. 
Recent University of Massachusetts 
Amherst graduate Evan Kenward’s 
uncertainty, on the other hand, comes 
from a cross-country road trip where 
everything goes wrong.

Kenward, who has an unrelenting 

urge to travel, plans his trip months 
in advance, choosing each stop, 
aiming to hike as much as he can 
and see friends along the way. At 
the start, the Subaru that is sup-
posed to take him and his two 
friends out of Amherst, through 
the Midwest and up to Vancouver, 
is in the shop. The car turns out 

to be drivable, but once he and 
his friends make it on the road, 
there is no shortage of surprises. 
Kenward recounts these twists and 
the anguish and ecstasy that come 
with them, in this post-grad novel 
inspired by true events.

The book unfolds as a com-
ing-of-age story — at the start, 
Kenward speaks like an angsty 
teen, whining and swearing, but he 
matures along the way.  Attentive, 
simultaneously contemplative and 
impulsive and opinionated, the 
retro music-loving, weed-smoking 
Kenward always has a witty com-
ment to make. He is spontaneous 
but, by his definition, not impul-
sive. Spontaneity, he believes, “is 
going by impulse and following up 
with intellect” (199). Occasionally, 
he thinks seriously about his long-
term future, but as soon as the next 
bus or ferry arrives, he’s off on his 
next adventure. His self-awareness 
of his wanderlust allows the story 
to flow seamlessly. Though we 

read from Kenward’s perspective, 
readers feel that they, too, experi-
ence the vistas he sees and the 
mountains he climbs. Readers are 
Kenward’s constant, silent com-
panions, as sympathetic, annoyed, 
nervous or excited as he is at any 
given time.

When the car finally does break 
down and his friends decide to 
return to Massachusetts, Kenward’s 
determination and positive outlook 
remain infallible and he decides 
to continue his quest alone. As 
he does so, slowly, his lust for 
travel infects the book. His expe-
rience, through disappointment 
and elation, is always a relatable 
one. Anxious college grads can 
learn from his go-with-the-flow 
demeanor.

Perhaps most rewarding about 
Kenward is that he holds back 
no opinions — from the reader, 
at least — but maintains an open 
mind. Whether it’s the oil tycoon in 
Nevada, the loving Christian family 

in Seattle or the tough hostel-keep-
er Devina, Kenward thoroughly 
tries to understand each person he 
meets and why they extend their 
kindness to him. With no contacts 
and no plans, Kenway is forced to 
try to connect with everyone he 
interacts with, no matter how little 
he has in common with them.

Finally, and most importantly, 
reading “Young Wanderlust” will 
make you want to hit the open 
road. Kenward deems regular tour-
ist activities deplorable; instead, he 
seeks out local hangouts and the 
forgotten nature hidden behind 
most small towns. With every 
breathtaking view and with each 
nerve-racking ride on public trans-
portation, the reader is inspired to 
plan his or her own trip using some 
of Kenward’s advice: Take life as it 
comes, and do it for the experience.

bourbon. Top the drink 
off with ice if you so 
choose, a mint sprig 
and a straw — you’ll

glass of Southern hos-
pitality.

Pour grenadine syrup 
into bottom of a col-

sour and chilled club 
soda. Top with cherry 
brandy and serve 
unstirred, garnished

perfect drink to get 
all of your friends on 
the same level, at the

“W e came here to fuck shit up in San Diego,” G-Eazy said.
And he did just that.
Through the puffs of smoke 

from various “herbs,” bras flung 
up on stage and splatter damage 
of one, young concert-goer who 
had a bit too much to drink, stood 
Gerald Earl Gillum, a veritable rap 
god — to his loyal fans, at least. In a 
night everyone may or may not have 
remembered, the stage at San Diego’s 
SOMA concert venue was, in every 
sense of the word, “dank.”

“You might know me as G-Eazy,” 
Gillum clarified.

The Oakland native, who repped 
his hometown with his No. 52 
Cespedes Athletics jersey under-
neath a black, leather jacket, came 
onto the music scene while in college 
in 2009. After graduating in 2011 
from Loyola University New Orleans 
with a B.S. in music industry stud-
ies, he subsequently released “The 
Outsider,” “The Endless Summer” 
and “Must Be Nice.” Working on his 
fourth, full-length album, “These 
Things Happen,” G-Eazy is cur-
rently on tour with several other 
up-and-coming rap musicians, 
including KYLE and Rockie Fresh, 
both who made an appearance at 
San Diego’s SOMA.

With a white neon light spelling 
out “G-Eazy” in the background 
and a black staircase built on stage, 
Gerald descended to the mic to give 
the crowd a resounding “thank you.”

If G-Eazy were to be remem-
bered for one aspect of his perfor-
mance, it would be for his talent 
with talking to the crowd and mak-
ing the concert more than just a per-
former and an audience. As G-Eazy 
went from song to song, repeatedly 
thanking the crowd for attending the 
show, he made sure to not just get 
his songs out, but to get everyone, 
especially women, as involved as 
possible. Apart from the feminine 
undergarments and one, black 
beanie thrown on stage, G-Eazy got 
the audience engaged in his perfor-
mance by prefacing his songs with 
an anecdote. 

When he sang catchy tune “Make 
Up Sex,” G-Eazy let the women in 
the house know they were “hot as 
fuck.” When the more soothing 
undertones of “Plastic Dreams” came 
on, he told the crowd that if he had 
a superpower, it would be knowing 
what women wanted, and what they 
wanted right now. But G-Eazy would 
be nothing without his manners, and 
he admitted it. Before getting into 
the lazy beats of “Reefer Madness,” 
he asked the crowd’s permission to 

light up on stage. After a raucous 
“yes” from the crowd, many of 
whom pulled out their own lighters 
and joints, G-Eazy was handed a 
blunt, took a puff and eased into a 
stoner’s delight of a song.

Even greater than G-Eazy’s 
affable nature with the crowd was his 
genuine appreciation for his fans. If 
there is one thing that rising artists 
need to do, it is to build a loyal fan-
base, who will come out to concerts 
on every tour. As G-Eazy geared 
up for his final song, “Loaded,” the 

audience blew up balloons that 
said “These Things Happen” and 
threw them in the air. As the bal-
loons were tossed like beach balls 
on stage and around the floor, 
G-Eazy left us with a message that 
should, and hopefully will, bring 
him the recognition he deserves:

“Make some fucking noise for 
yourselves. Without you, I wouldn’t 
be on this stage.”

How Wes 
Anderson 
Teaches Us 
to Cringe

“The Grand Budapest Hotel,” Wes Anderson’s newest film, is being 
released across the country tomor-
row, so as a primer, I’ve been 
feverishly rewatching all his earlier 
work.

What I’ve found, though, is that, 
even though I dig these movies, I 
can’t marathon-watch them. I can’t 
even get through more than one a 
day. That’s partly because mainlin-
ing four-plus hours of overhead 
camera shots, slow-mo sequences 
and beautifully timed silences can 
get boring.

More than that, though, is the 
cognitive effort that Anderson’s 
comedy requires of the viewer that 
makes sitting through back-to-back 
Anderson films impossible. And 
I’m starting to believe that’s this is a 
good thing.

As part of my Anderson ret-
rospective, I watched “The Royal 
Tenenbaums,” one of his ear-
lier films, with some friends. I’ve 
already seen it several times, and 
I’m a cripplingly self-conscious 
individual, so I spent much of the 
movie not actually watching the 
movie but watching my friends as 
they watched it.

What I found — but what won’t 
be a surprise to anyone familiar 
with Anderson’s work — is that 
whenever we laughed, it was 
always a hesitant, awkward, unsure 
laugh. Part of that is because 
“Tenenbaums” is a blackly comedic 
exploration of deep depression and 
personal loss, and so, laughing is 
usually slightly uncomfortable. 

But the bigger reason is that 
Anderson, as far as I can tell, has 
never made an obvious joke in 
his life. What this subtlety does 
to the viewing experience is really 
interesting. It puts the viewer in a 
space of uncertainty. Throughout 
the film, the viewer is never really 
sure whether he should be laugh-
ing or not, because he can’t be sure 
whether what just happened was a 
joke or not.

If this viewer watches 
“Tenenbaums” — or any Anderson 
film — as a comedy, the only way 
out of that space of uncertainty is 
to spend the whole 100 minutes 
intensely aware of every half-line 
that, in another movie, would be 
used as a throwaway to avoid an 
awkward silence. It is to watch not 
just the foreground of the scene but 
the background, too. It is to watch 
not just the character speaking but 
also the characters listening. 

All of this is really hard work 
for any of Anderson’s viewers. 
But this hard work is sort of the 
point. Watching Anderson’s mov-
ies closely forces the viewer into 
a state of mindfulness that goes 
far beyond the average amount of 
attention that normal entertain-
ment demands of the viewer. More 
importantly, this is foreign to the 
viewer’s quotidian experience.

In a sense, Anderson’s mov-
ies are like a brief depiction of 
what being more mindful in real 
life would be like. It would be tir-
ing. It would be hard. It would be 
awkward sometimes. But, just as 
much of the beauty of Anderson’s 
films comes across only because the 
viewer is forced to really pay atten-
tion, some of the parts of life that 
we’re missing now might only come 
across if we pay really close atten-
tion. Anderson’s films, I think, can 
help us get there.

CONCERT  REVIEW

GUARDIAN GOES GLOBAL: MAMA’S BAKERY & DELI
The Guardian samples the world’s cuisine in San Diego. This week: Lebanon.

Open in North Park for more than 
two decades, Mama’s Bakery and Deli 
serves a menu full of recipes straight 
from the heart Lebanon, still using the 
original sajj — a bread pan that looks 
like an upside-down wok — the chefs 
cooked with back in the Middle East. 
“The original Mama started her res-
taurant in this location 25 years ago,” 
the cashier said. “And we’ve been here 
ever since.”

From a distance, Mama’s Bakery 
& Deli looks like a standard deli 
shop, nondescriptly placed on a small 
side street, but once you step through 
the door, the aroma of fresh ingre-
dients and cooking envelops you, 
inviting you in. The parking is stan-
dard for North Park — scarce street 
parking along residential areas — but 
worth spending time to find, as the 
menu is quite extensive, offering a 
medley of salads, appetizers, dips, 
flatbreads, meat and cheese pies, 
wraps, combo plates and pastries — 
all at affordable prices.

First up was an appetizer, the leb-
neh and zaatar dip ($5.99), a yogurt 
cheese blend — similar to a sour, 
bland whipped cream  — topped with 
herbs, sumac, sesame seeds and olive 
oil and served with pita bread . While 
the appetizer was a bit of a flop, the 
wraps that came up next didn’t disap-

point; they were a whopping 10 to 12 
inches long, large enough for even the 
hungriest of athletes. The garlic chick-
en wrap ($6.75) was juicy, tender and 
packed with savory, garlicky goodness; 
a definite go-to menu item worth 
ordering again. The beef shawarma 
wrap ($6.75) was chocked-full of pick-
led cucumbers and zesty sauce but fell 
on the dry side. The beef and chicken 
offered on the meat combo plate 
($9.99) were also rather dry, although 
it did come with a generous amount 
of hummus, falafel, rice and salad. 

Their extensive savory selection is 
accompanied by a variety of desserts, 
including pistachio bars, cashew 
fingers, honey cakes and pistachio 
cakes — all rather small, so don’t 
hesitate to pick more than a few. The 
much-anticipated, Yelp-endorsed 
baklava was unfortunately sold out 
— so visit earlier in the day if you 
want to try some. The pistachio bar 
and cake were basically the same des-
sert with different textures: The cake 
was flakier while the bar was crispier, 
but both had the same, heavy honey 
taste. Instead, try the cashew finger, 
a long, nut-filled puff pastry whose 
buttery, flaky goodness will satisfy 
your sweet tooth.

The waiters were friendly and 
brought out the food within 10 
minutes. Overall, the meal was 
pleasant enough, but in truth, other 
Mediterranean restaurants in the 
area outmatch Mama’s. The only dish 
worth spending money on is the garlic 
chicken wrap; other dishes fall short 
in flavor. Should you find yourself 
hungry while wandering through 
North Park, however, you might as 
well head over to Mama’s and taste 
what our friends from Lebanon have 
to offer.

P acific Beach doesn’t usually come to mind when you’re looking for a nice place to 
relax — most picture rowdy frat 
bros letting loose for the weekend. 
But look further, and on the corner 
of Cass Street and Grand Avenue 
you’ll find the quirky hole-in-the-
wall Purple Cafe.

Purple Cafe’s storefront is 
reminiscent of a dive bar, with faded 
purple paint and a window that 
could use a good clean. But inside, 
instead of dim lighting, beer and 
pool, you’ll find cheery yellow pan-
eled walls, bagelwiches and freshly 
brewed coffee. Once inside, howev-
er, the decor is rustic-meets-shabby 
chic. With mix-matched tables and 
wine bottle flower vases, Purple 
Cafe is the perfect match place for a 
Sunday brunch for 20-somethings. 
You’ll see girlfriends getting togeth-
er for coffee in the corner booth 
and students studying with their 
laptops at the mismatched tables. 
With more power outlets than Price 
Center and none of the stench from 
a mix of Subway and Panda, Purple 
Cafe is the perfect place to get away 
for a study break. Since most cus-
tomers tend to sit on the outside 
patio, the noise level inside the cafe 
stays low.

Whether you’re looking for black 
coffee or something sweet, there’s a 
drink for every caffeine fiend. There’s 
the standard Americano (starting 
at $2.25) or the cappuccino ($2.95). 
If you’re stuck between mocha and 
a white mocha, the Tuxedo ($3.95) 
combines a white mocha and a 
Mexican mocha, a mocha made 
with cinnamon. For something more 
dessert-like, try any of their blended 
coffee drinks. The Orange Cream 
($3.50) blended coffee made with 

vanilla coffee, is the pureed equivalent 
to a Creamsicle in a cup. 

To accompany your coffee, Purple 
Cafe also has a host of bagel and egg 
items on its menu. If you’re not a fan 
of schmear, feel free to ask for hum-
mus on any of their bagel sandwiches. 
Order hummus on the Works bagel 
($2.95), topped with cucumber, toma-
to and sprouts, and convince yourself 
you’re eating a healthy breakfast. If 
you’re craving eggs, try the Dr. Seuss-
inspired Green Eggs and Ham ($5.75), 
scrambled eggs cooked with pesto, 
bacon and toast. Or, if you’re the type 
to skip breakfast, order a sandwich 

or a wrap — try a simple but filling 
avocado, sprouts, greens and tomato 
sandwich on wheat bread ($5.75) or 
the Italy wrap ($6.95), stuffed with 
turkey, mozzarella cheese, tomato, 
greens and pesto.

From the moment you order your 
coffee from the baristas behind the 
counter, you’ll feel right at home at 
Purple Cafe, whether you’re sitting 
down with your pals or just reading a 
book on a lazy PB afternoon.

U nless you lived under a rock all of last year, you likely heard a song or two featuring 
Pharrell Williams. Pharrell showed 
up in Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” and 
Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines,” and 
his new single, “Happy,” was used in 
“Despicable Me 2” and received an 
Oscar nomination for Best Original 
Song. Now, after well over a decade 
in the music indus-
try, Pharrell has the 
world’s recognition, 
so how does he use it? 
Evidently, to push his 
new album, “G I R L,” 
which, while enjoy-
able, doesn’t come 
close to living up to 
its hype.

“G I R L” stands 
out from much of 
pop music because it doesn’t drag 
down the album with the usual 
soggy, sluggish power ballad or a 
song that attempts to showcase the 
artist’s darker side. “It Girl,” “Happy” 
and “Come Get It Bae” draw from 
gospel, while strong disco and soul 
influences show up in “Brand New,” 
“Hunter” and “Gush” — they would 
be believable Earth, Wind & Fire 
songs with the sole addition of a 
neon, spandex-clad horn section. 
There’s some stylistic variation, but 
“G I R L” consistently shakes its hips 
and has a good time, and that gives 
the album some real momentum.

Past the fun dance feels, though, 
“G I R L” has little to offer. Its lyrics 

range from generic to cliche. The 
opening verse of the album features 
one of the less original lines: “I 
close my eyes and visions appear / 
She’s everything I want and it’s crys-
tal clear.” Dance music isn’t known 
for lyrics that think outside the box, 
but Pharrell would have done well 
to choose between tired phrases 
and sappy sentiments instead of 

overusing both.
To top it off, the 

lyrical themes repeat 
well after the monotony 
has set in. Over half 
of the songs chronicle 
Pharrell trying to get 
women to have sex 
with him. Worst of all, 
nothing differentiates 
these women — the 
only variation comes 

from the degree to which they give 
him the cold shoulder. He doesn’t 
have much to say about their per-
sonalities, but physically, he leaves 
little to the imagination in “Hunter,” 
“Gush” and “Lost Queen,” among 
others. If anything about this “G I 
R L” is on point, it’s the album’s title 
— Pharrell sings almost exclusively 
about girls, but instead of sound-
ing suave, it plays like a one-night 
stand — fun and frisky for a night, 
but painfully awkward for every 
subsequent encounter.

—     kyle  somers

Release Date March 3

This dance-infused pop album ultimately paints 
Pharrell as an oversexed creep of the club scene.

really good.”
Freshmen Emmanuel Elijah and 

Markus Wood also earned first-place 
honors in the 100-meter dash (11.16) 
and 400 hurdles (55.39), respec-
tively. Sophomores Dan Golubovic 
and Randy Copeman finished first, 
as well, with Golubovic in the high 
jump (6’4.75”) and Copeman in the 
long jump (22’5.75”). 

The Tritons also had two more 
NCAA provisional qualifiers in 
senior Mario Flores and junior 
Carlos Bojorquez. Both Flores and 
Bojorquez finished third in the 3000 
steeplechase (9:23.16) and the 1500 
(3:51.44), respectively. 

While the Tritons found success 
over the weekend, Salerno acknowl-

edges that their performance against 
these non-conference opponents give 
little indication of what is in store for 
the rest of the season. 

“We have to kind of wait and see 
how things lay out with other teams,” 
Salerno said. “We’re very early [in 
the] season so we don’t know what 
every [school] has yet. The lists are 
just starting to coming out now, but 
the hope is to win the conference 
championship on both the men’s and 
the women’s sides, if possible.” 

UCSD will next host the San 
Diego Collegiate Challenge held this 
Saturday, March 15 at Triton Track 
and Field Stadium. The meet will 
commence at noon. 

game had been ruled complete and the 
Tritons given the decision.

Seven Tritons crossed home 
plate in the final game of the series 
while five tallied two runs each. La 
Face continued his efforts in the 
nightcap with three RBI, two hits 
and two runs on his three appear-
ances at the plate. 

Sophomore right-hander Troy 

Cruz (2–1) pitched all six innings 
against the Toros and only allowed 
seven hits across 29 batters faced. 
Cruz is now the only Triton to have 
started all 17 games in the 2014 
season, with three of those starts 
coming on the mound.

Senior outfielder Justin Rahn is 
the only Triton to get on base in all 17 
games this season.

“I feel like I can bat .400 if I keep 
working hard,” Rahn told the UCSD 

Athletics Department. “I’ve got to stay 
hungry;,I’ve got to keep working.”

UCSD comes off the four-game 
winning streak — now the longest 
in the CCAA — to host a four-game 
series against Cal State Monterey 
Bay this weekend at Triton Ballpark. 
The series opener is scheduled for 6 
p.m. on Friday, March 14.

The UCSD men’s and women’s 
fencing teams faced fierce competi-
tion at the NCAA West Regionals 
hosted by Caltech this past Saturday, 
ultimately putting two Triton men 
on the podium. The teams compet-
ed against Caltech, Stanford and the 
United States Air Force Academy.

In the men’s sabre category, 
Triton sophomore Travis Tibbitts 
placed third. His teammates soph-
omore Drew Dickinson, senior 
Bryson Abilay and junior Peter 
Meckling finished close behind in 
fifth, sixth and seventh positions, 
respectively. The men’s sabre com-
petition winner was Ryan Redhead 
from Air Force.

For the men’s epee, junior Adam 

Campbell-Kruger reached the podi-
um in a third-place effort. Freshman 
Sean Callaghan finished fourth,

For the men’s foil, junior Jeffrey 
Chan was fourth, while junior 
Keric Moore ended fifth. The win-
ner of the men’s foil was Olympian 
Alexander Massialas from Stanford.

In the women’s foil, sophomore 
Nicole Chiang finished as fourth, 
sophomore Alina Marshall placed 
seventh, and junior Rosalyn Lim 
was eighth. Sophomore Megan 
Gesner finished fourth for the wom-

Regionals, UCSD next faces the 
2014 NCAA Championships. Last 
season, Tritons Campbell-Kruger 
and Ginestet represented UCSD. 
This year, Tibbitts will compete for 
the Tritons in the men’s sabre.

When asked about Tibbits’ 
potential at the Championships, fel-
low teammate sophomore Isabelle 
Pinard said, “Travis values every 
touch and pushes his body and mind 
once his feet are on the strip. Give 
him the opportunity to make top 
four and he will go beyond expecta-
tion; he will win the tournament.”

The NCAA Championships will 
be held at Ohio State from March 20 
to 23 in Columbus, Ohio.

UCSD Sweeps CSU Dominguez Hills Crew Defeated by USD at 
SD City Championships

BASeBAll men'S  cRew

La Face earns CCAA Player of the Week, Donatella breaks UCSD strikeout record.

The Tritons (7–5) split a four-game series against the 
previously undefeated, CCAA-leading Mustangs.UCSD swept Cal State Dominguez 

Hills in a four-game conference series 
over the weekend to win its first 
series in the 2014 season. The Tritons 
improved their record to 11–6 overall 
and are 8–4 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association with only Cal Poly 
Pomona ahead of them in the CCAA 
standings. Both sophomore right-
hander Justin Donatella (3–1) and 
senior catcher Nick La Face had career 
performances over the weekend, with 
La Face earning CCAA Player of the 
Week recognition.

La Face went 6-for-11 in the series 
with eight walks, bringing his on-base 
percentage to .737. In the doublehead-
er on Saturday, La Face had five hits 
on six at-bats, with two of them being 
doubles. The senior catcher drew four 
walks, tallied four runs and recorded 
six RBI. 

Game 1
Donatella’s heroics on the mound 

allowed UCSD to hang on to a nar-
row 1–0 lead to win the opening game 
in the series last Thursday night at 
Triton Ballpark. The right-hander 
pitched a career-high 8.1 innings and 
sat down a career-high 13 batters, a 
program record in the Division-II era 
of UCSD baseball. His pitching sup-
ported a Triton offense struggling with 
the Toros’ starter on the mound, David 
Haerle, who only allowed one run on 
three hits.

“I think it keeps you at the top 
of your game,” Donatella said about 
pitching against Haerle. “I think it just 
keeps you on your toes — you can’t 
give up a run or we’re tied.”

Senior right-hander Scott Zeman 

replaced Donatella on the mound early 
in the ninth inning after Donatella 
struggled with a series of Dominguez 
HIlls hitters. Zeman was credited with 
the save after only four pitches.

Game 2
UCSD repeated its shutout per-

formance the following night to 
rack up its first back-to-back shut-
outs since 1995, beating the Toros 
7–0. The Tritons’ offense produced 
a big second inning with five runs 
on three hits and four walks to give 
junior southpaw Trevor Scott room 
on the mound. Ten Tritons found 
themselves in the box in the second 
inning, with junior catcher Brett 
Levy starting the scoring by striking 
a two-run single early in the frame. 

Scott only allowed four hits against 
24 batters faced across six frames and 
struck out six for his first winning 
decision in 2014. Junior right-hander 
Dan Kolodin replaced Scott for the 
seventh and eighth, while fellow junior 
right-hander Javier Carillo, Jr. closed 
in the ninth for the save. Carillo, a 
transfer from Skyline College, made 
his debut as a Triton and racked up the 
first save of his UCSD career.

Game 3
The Tritons traveled to Carson, 

Calif. for the final two games of 
the series in a doubleheader last 
Saturday. In the first three frames, 
both teams only produced one run 
each. Cal State Dominguez Hills 
started the scoring in the first 
inning, beginning a game that 
would see five lead changes. UCSD 
answered in the third, knotting the 
game up. However, the Toros tallied 
two runs in the fourth, fifth and 
sixth frames to bring the score to 
7–6 to start the seventh. 

Zeman took the mound for the 
three final innings to shut out the 
Toros offense entirely, producing 
four strikeouts. The Tritons offense 
capitalized on the opportunity and 
scored three more runs to bring the 
final score to 9–7.

Game 4
The final game of the series was 

suspended due to darkness after 
six innings, with UCSD up 12–4.  
UCSD returned to La Jolla after the 
suspension and took to the road 
Sunday only to be informed that the 

For the first time since 2004, 
the UCSD men’s crew team did not 
win the two-team San Diego City 
Championship, handing over the title 
to the University of San Diego.

Last Saturday, March 4 the Tritons 
competed against their cross-town 
rivals, USD. In a best-of-three format, 
the Tritons and Toreros rowed for six, 
four and three minutes respectively 
with the crew covering the longest 
distance in that time announced the 
winner. 

The Toreros’ Varsity-8 crew came 
out strong, comfortably beating 
UCSD in all three races. 

“It wasn’t too bad of a race for 
us, but we just kind of got out-
worked,” senior Varsity-8 member 
Zack Attaran said. “USD hasn’t beat-
en us in a while so they were fired up 
and just all-around a little bit faster 
than us.”

UCSD’s Novice-8 crew fared a 
little better but still lost its first two 

pieces before winning the last three-
minute piece.

“I was really excited for them,” 
Attaran said. “That team is made up of 
a lot of walk-ons, and for a lot of them, 
that was their first or second race. They 
battled the whole way, and it was good 
to see them come away with the result.”

The Tritons will now head up north 
to Davis, California to compete against 
Gonzaga University, Santa Clara 
University and UC Davis this Friday, 
March 14.

Although disappointed by the 
results last weekend, Attaran said the 
team feels ready to compete in the 
three-team meet.

“Gonzaga is first up for us and 
because they’re frozen over up North, 
this will be their first time in the water 
since November,” Attaran said. “In 
theory, we should be better prepared 
than them, but we’ll see. They do a 
lot of indoor training and are always a 
strong team.”

Triton women win All-Cal 
Championships, men finish second  

in season opener.

BY BRANDON YU
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

his past weekend, the UCSD track and field 
teams showed promising results at the All-Cal 
Championships held at Triton Track & Field 
Stadium. Facing off against Division-I sister 
schools UC Irvine, UC Riverside and UC Santa 
Barbara, the women’s squad placed first overall, 

while the Triton men finished second. 
On the women’s side, the Tritons secured the top overall 

spot for the first time since their back-to-back first place 
finishes in 2008 and 2009. UCSD recorded a total of 221 
points, followed by UCSB with 189, UC Irvine with 122 
and UC Riverside with 76. Santa Barbara had finished first 
in the previous three years. 

“It was just a really great landmark for us to beat 
Division I teams at this time,” UCSD women’s head coach 
Darcy Ahner said. “It really let me know that we [have] the 
depth and the talent that we need to have a great season. 
Above all, it was a great confidence booster.” 

Overall, the Triton women took top honors in six of the 
19 total events.

Junior Chantia Justice earned first place in the triple 
jump with the farthest distance of 38’6.75”. Sophomore 
Haley Libuit also finished first in the women’s javelin, and 
her top distance of 135’2” earned a provisional qualifier for 
the NCAA championships. 

“[Haley]’s a gun in the javelin,” Ahner told the Guardian. 
“She’s just a great competitor and really fun to watch.”  

On the track side, three Tritons took individual first-
place honors: junior sprinter Janay Pierce in the 100-meter 
with 12.24, freshman Lauren Lopez in the 400 meter with 
57.17 and junior All-American Sabrina Pimentel in the 
800-meter with 2:15.12. 

Pimentel, freshman Jackie Chalmers, sophomore Ellexi 
Snover and anchor Lopez recorded a top finish together for 
UCSD in the 4x400 relay with a final time of 3:51.21, well 
ahead of second place finishers UC Irvine (3:54.53). 

The Triton men together recorded 179 total points, 
trailing UCSB (214), who finished first for the fifth straight 
All-Cal Championships. UC Riverside came in third (125) 
while UC Irvine ended in fourth (100). UCSD earned top 
honors in five events on the men’s side. 

“We had some real standout marks,” UCSD men’s head 
coach Tony Salerno said. “I’m not sure we could’ve done 
too much more to be successful. Santa Barbara’s just a little 
too much for us this year. I think we’ll get them next year.”

The highlight for the meet on the Triton side was junior 
All-American Nash Howe, who in his season debut record-
ed a 218’10” throw in a first-place effort in the javelin. The 
feat served as UCSD’s only automatic qualifying mark for 
the NCAA Championships. Howe’s performance sends him 
to his second straight NCAA appearance.

“It’s really promising,” Salerno said. “He was seventh in 
nationals last year as a sophomore. He’s really shown he’s 
a prodigy in javelin and to [come up] this big this early is
