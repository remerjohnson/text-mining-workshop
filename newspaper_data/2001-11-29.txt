SAAC chair alleges IKoala' harassment 
~ewest edition of student publication available online 
By JEFFREY WHm 
News Editor 

Declaring UCSD a hostile envi-
ronment for minorities, Student 
Affi rmative Action Committee 
Chairman Emesto Martinez blast-
ed The KoIIItz and UCSD adminis-
tration in a series of e-mails to cam-
pus officials, alleging harassment by 
members of The KoIIItz and adminis-
tration inaction. 

Images of Martinez - a vocal 
critic of The KOQItz - appear exten-
sively in the publication's online 
edition, which was posted Nov. 27. 
At press time the issue could be 
downloaded at 
http;//'IJI'WW.thekoQIIl.org. KOQItz 
Edi tor in Chief George Liddle 
sa id the printed edition will hit 
UCSD racks Friday. 

In the online edition one of the 
12 photos of Martinez is titled 
"Emesto Martinez's Ugly Mug," 
and its caption states that every 
time there is a joke in the publica-
tion involving Martinez, a photo 
of his head will be placed next to it 
"so as to assist him in cutting out 
the articles for distribution to all 
of the student councils.» 

Also appearing is the text of a 
letter from Martinez to Liddle, 
with typographical and grammati-
cal errors underlined by The KoIIItz. 
Following the letter is a response 

from KOQIQ editors criticizing 
Martinez's English, among other 
things. 

Martinez said The KoIIItz's con-
tent has been indicative of igno-
rance that is not uncommon at 
UCSD. 

"When you have diversity being 
attacked; when you have diversity 
being laughed at; when you have 
people taking advantage of the First 
Amendment; it goes to show how 
this university is,» he said. 

Liddle said The KoIIJII's use of the 
Martinez photos has nothing to do 
wi th Martinez's race or ethnici ty. 

"This has nothing to do with the 
race of Emesto Martinez," Liddle 
said. "We have nothing against him 
except for the fact that he is calling 
us racists, and we are not The fact 
is, the charges he is bringing against 
The KoIIJII are ridiculous." 

Martinez said he never called 
for The KDtI/Q to be censored, only 
that it be more sensitive to under-
represented UCSD students, staff 
and faculty. 

"The ideal outcome is for The 
KoIIJII to really see itself, and edu-
cate itself," he said. "I am in favor 
of The KDtI/Q respecting people. 
That's what I'm in favor of." 

Martinez said the administra-
tion has been unresponsive to his 
complaints regarding The KoIIItz. 

"I was very disappointed with

the lacle of support I got from 
UCSD administration," he said. 
"This university claims to uphold 
diversity, yet there was no response 
to this attack on diversity." 

Referring to the issue on The 
KoIIItz Web site, Martinez again e-
mailed UCSD administration 

Nov. 28 informing them of The 
KoIzltz's newest issue. 

"Forget my image, now look at 
all the overt racism they have on 
[their] paper - and UCSD will let 
this happen? Thanks for the sup-

Millions allocated for campus buildings 
Construction continues despite revenue shortfall

"'Despite a UC budget shortfall 
expected next year, sevtral con-

For the 2002-2003 budget, $334

UC Regents 
OK staff pay 
• Increases 
Some deans to 
receive big boost 
By DANIEL WAns 
Staff Writer 

The UC Regents approved 
200 1-2001 salary increases of up to 
25 percent for some top adminis-
trators in a budget proposal passed 
Nov. 15. However, most faculty 
and staff members wi ll ee their 
salaries increase by only 0.5 to 2 
percent. 

The regents passed the budget 
proposal amid predictions of 
reduced state revenues due to the 
economic downturn that may 
result in general funding cuts for 
the Universiry of California. 

UC staff members are broken 
down into union and non-union 
employees, said UCSD Director of 
Human Resources T homas Leet. 

U nion employee salaries are 
determined by a collective bargain-
ing process through the union 's 
representation. 

Salaries for non-union employ-
ees such as the executive vice chan-
cellors are dependent on the UC

Ability of peptides to prevent 
infection discovered at UCSD 

Peptides known for 20 years to possess anti-
microbial properties have finally been proven to 
selVe as a natural defense against bacteria by 
researchers from UCSD and the Veteran Affairs San 
Diego Healthcare System. 

The findings may lead to the creation of better 
treatments and drugs to fight bacterial infections. 

The researchers studied the growth of microbes 
in relation to the presence of cathelicidins: peptides 
that are located in various mammal tissues, includ-
ing white blood cells. 

Richard Gallo, UCSD associate professor of med-
icine and pediatrics and chief of the dermatolo.&y 
section at the VA hospital at UCSD, selVed as senior 
author Df the research, which appears in the Nov. 
22,2001 issue of Nature. 

Funding for the research was provided by the 
National Institutes for Health and Ihe Department of 
Veterans Affairs.

Vasumati Pestonjamasp, Jennifer Rudisill, Robert A 

Dorschner, Joseph Piraino and Kenneth Huttner con-
tributed to the research and article. 

UCSD researchers photograph 
brain nerve cells in action 

For the first time, images showing the forma.tion 
of temporary and permanent memory connectl~ns 
in human brain cells have been produced by sCien-
tists from UCSD's divisions of biology and physical 
sciences. The images show structural changes in 
neurons that occur when both short- and long-term 
memory information is stDred. 

The experiments focused on the hippocampus, 
which is the portion of the brain that stores rr:'emo-
ry. Electrical impulses were sent to thiS region to 
cause nelVe cells to make connections, which were 
then filmed.The findings of the experiments appear 
in the Nov. 30 issue of Cel/. 

Michael A. Colicos served as the paper's lead 
author. Yukiko <:;oda led the research team comprised 
of Michael J. Salior and Boyce E. Collins. Grants from 
the National Science Foundation and !he National 
Institute of Health partially financed the ·research.

UCSD uses Web to fight cheating 
Plagiarism to be combatted via Internet company 
By KIRmN HUBBARD 
Staff Writer 

In an effort to eliminate 
cheating on class assignments, 
UCSD has signed a two-year 
contract with IParadigms Inc., 
which runs an Internet-based 
service designed to stop plagia-
rism. 

Through this service, called 
turnirin .coll1, professors can sub-
mit student essays, research 
papers and recitations through a 
large-scale search engine. These 
papers are then compared with 
documents throughout the entire 
Internet, along with an extensive 
archive of previously submitted 
student papers. 

The papers are returned with 
an "Originality Report," which is 
a duplicate of the submitted stu-
dent paper with any text copied 
or paraphrased from the Internet 
highlighted and color-coded . 
The professor can then follow 
links to the original online 
sources ·from which the portions 
of the paper were plagiarized and 
determine whether it is necessary 
to take action. 

Once implemented by the 
university, the service may be

port, I've never been so proud of 
being from the University of 
California, San Diego," stated 
Martinez in the e-mail that was

used by instructors without any 
charge to their department. 

"I think it's an excellent tool 
to ensure that the authenticity of 
student work is maintained," said 
Nick Aguilar, director of Student 
Policy and Judicial Affairs. "The 
tool sends a message to the stu-
dents that we value integrity." 

Students and professors at 
Thurgood Marshall and Eleanor 
Roosevelt Colleges implemented 
turnitin.com on a trial basis in 
the Dimensions Of Culture and 
Making of the Modern World 
programs during winter 2001 
and spring 2001 quarters. 

Most students and instructors 
were sa tisfied with the results, 
and SPJA decided to establish the 
service throughout the entire 
university. 

However, Benjamin Carson, a 
DOC non-student instructor, has 
mixed fee lings about the pro-
gram's implications. 

"I always get depressed when 
I use (turnitin.com]," he said. 
"TAs should be aware enough of 
student development that a sud-
den change in achievement 
would be noticeable. Yet some-
times it's necessary." 

Andrew Mo, a Warren fresh-

addressed to UCSD Chancellor 
Robert C. Dynes, Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph WatsOn, 
and Director of Student Policies 
and Judicial Affairs Nicholas 
Aguilar, among others. 

Aguilar said the administration 
will not censor any student publi-
cation unless local, state or federal 
law is broken. 

"Student media is funded by 

man, objects to the process. 
"Plagiarism comes from pro-

crastination and high levels of 
competition among students. 
(Turnitin.com) does not solve the 
root of the problem," he said. 
"Students need to learn how to 
manage their time more effi-
ciently." 

The turnltlll .com system 
claims over 15,000 registered 
users ranging from high school 
teachers to whole universities. It 
is employed at other UC cam-
puses as well as high-ranked 
institutions such as Duke, 
Cornell and the California 
Institute of Technology, where it 
has been in service for years. 

Turnitin.com states that its 
philosophy is not merely to 
apprehend plngiarizers, but to 
discourage students from plagia-
rizing in the first place. 

"The adoption of t11is service 
is about more than catching 
wrongdoers," Aguilar said. "We 
want students to become aware 
that academic integrity is impor-
tant, and we want to ensure that 
students who may be inclined to 
plagiarize will make the right 
decision and not risk their acade-
mic careers." 

A.S., and the administration takes 
no position," said Agui lar, prior to 
the posting of the newest online

Pay: 
Some administrators to 
receive hefty raises 
Continued from page 1 
Office of the President. 

The campuses "supply the 
Office of the President with market 
information (regarding admil1lstra-
tor salaries], which is taken into 
consideration to determine the 
salary," Leet said. 

Campus execlltive vice chan-
ce llors and engineering deans are 
among those awarded the largest 
raises. UC Berkeley'S executive 
vice chancellor, Paul Gray, will see 
a 17 percent pay increase frOIll 
$222,800 to $260,000. The salary 
of A. Richard ewton, Berkeley's 
dean of the college of engineer-
ing, will rise 23 percent from 
$204,000 to $250,000. UCSD's 
engineering dean can expect a 15 
percent increase in pay, which will 
raise that salary to $240,000. 

Other campuses will see similar 
increases in vice chancellors' 
salaries. UC Riverside's executive 
vice chancellor's yearly pay will 
grow by 20 percent and UCLA's 
will rise 25.9 percent. 

Tenured UC professors have a 
$91,934 average salary. Two-
thirds of the professors will get a 
0.5 percent cost-of-living raise 
while the remaining one-third will 
get 2 percent raises. The rate of 
inflation in 2000 was about 2.8 
percent. 

"Preserving top-caliber leader-
ship, especially during these 
extremely challenging economic 
times, is critical to maintaining 
UC's competitiveness and institu-
tional quality," UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz told the San Francisco 
Chr01liclt. 

All payment increases exceeding 
2 percent - other than those fund-
ed by the Deparonent of Energy 
contract funds - are subject to UC 

NEWS 3 

President Richard C. Atkinson's 
discretion. Increases are deferred 
until Atkinson deems thcm neces-
sary, depending on budget con-
straints, economic condi tions, and 
individual retention and cquity 
considerations. 

Gov. Gray Davis carns 
$165 ,000, which is less than half 
of Atkinson's salary of $349, 100. 
The national median sa lar}' of the 
chief executive officer of a public 
university system is $202,500, 
according to the BOllldrr COl/llty 
Daily Ca7llfrll. 

Research done by the indepen-
dent firm William M. Mcrccr. Inc. 
shows that the average UC chan -
ccllor's salary of $280,610 is 33 
pcrcent Icss than the :1\ eragc 
chancellor sa lary of the compJri-
son group. Factoring in the 
increases approved ov. IS, the 
average UC chancellor salary II III 
still trail the comparison group by 
25 percent. 

The University of Ca lifornia 
u es a market-based method of 
determining salaries for sel1lor 
administrators in compliancc with 
an agrecmcnt with the California 
Postsecondary Education 
Commission. 

Harvard, Stanford, Yale, 
alifornia Institute of Tcchnology 

and Columbia University are 
among the 26 comparable public 
and private universi ties used to 
determinc the UC administraror 
salaries. 

UC anta Barbara chemistry 
professor Richard Watts said the 
raises are inappropiate at this time. 

"I have no doubt that many 
(administrators] arc worthy, but I 
feel there is a disparity between the 
way they are being handled and the 
way the faculty are being handled," 
Watts told the Sall FrallClSco 
Ch,·ollide. 

There are 8,000 professors 
employed by the University of 
California, and about 160,000 tOtal 
UC employees.

Davis gets a failing 
grade for planning 
education cuts 

T he recession into which the nation is 
s in~ng is hitting home in a big way for 
CalIfornians; even our seemin C7ly impervious ~OO~ll. times have busted, as ti'nemp)oyment 
IS rtSlI1g and the state's tllX revenues are 
down. In light of the decl ining state econo-
my, the state is considerin cr mea ures to 
tighten Ca lifornia's belt. 0 

Gov. Gray Davis' proposed cuts for state 
spending in 2001-2002 take chunks from 
programs across the board - rai l projects, 
cancer research, arts grants and health pro-
grams face reduction, el imination or delay. 

Also suffering is education both K-12 
and i ns.titu~ons of higher l ea r~ng such as 
the UniversIty of California. 

The Guardian believes that while tough 
tin:es necessitate hard choices, cuts to ecfu-
caaon should be a last resort, implemented 
only after all other options have been 
exhausted. 

The cuts that Davis has proposed would 
~do many of .the. steps . take~ recently to 
Improve educatlOn 111 Caltforl1la. 

Much of. t.he money appropriated under 
the Proposltlon 98 General Fund, which 
guarantees a set amount of money for K-12 
schoo!s, would be reverted to the state. 

ThIS would preempt an expansion of 
Healthy Start progr~s, tak~ money away 
from charter schools in low-mcome neigh-
borhoods, delay implementation of much-
needed before- and after-school programs reduc~ bonuses to teachers whose studen~ 
show Improvement on statewide tests take 
a:-v.ay money set aside to assist school; with 
rising energy costs and deny schools a $12-
per-pupil grant from the state. 

The University of California will also feel 
the pinch. Davis has asked the regents to cut 

th~i~ budget by as much as 15 percent -
this 111 the face of ever-growing waves of stu-
dents. 

Because the fiscal future for the universi-
ty i~ uncertain, UC President Richard C. 
Atkinson has unfortunately had to put 

plann~d .raises for staff and faculty on hold. 
Also 111 Jeopardy are state-subsidized sum-

me~ programs at UC Berkeley and UCLA, 
whIch are needed to accomodate rising 
numbers of students. 

. The.budget busts even have the regents in 
dISCUSSIon about sending s~me of the top 
12 .? percent of gradua tll1g California 
se~ors .who are guaranteed admission to the 
u~l\.:erslty to community colleges, under-
mll1l11g the success with which the un iversi-
ty can serve Californians. 

Before ta1cing money away from necessary 
and helpful programs such as those above 
we suggest that the governor resort to tem~ 
pora.rr tax hikes to try to recoup some of the 
declInll1g tax revenues. 11, d ' D ' , y\.e a mIre aVIs commitment to 
California's econ?l:nic hea lth and his will ing-
ne t~ ma~e poiJtlca lly unpopular spending 
reductions In an election cycle. However, it 
would be more commendable to make the 
strong statement that investments in our 
sta te and nation's future are worth more 
money from taxpayers' pockets. 

~a l ifornia~s have repeatedly named edu-
cation .as theIr top concern; II1deed, Davis 
campaIgned on promises to strengthen 

c;a li f~rn ia's ai ling public schools and pro-
VIde . Improved support to our top-notch 
pubiJc universities. 

We hope that Davis remembers the value 
Californ ians place upon education, and the

Campus organizations must 
welcome diversity . 

Religous organizations should work together 
to promote understanding and tolerance 

By MAmtEW CROW 
Staff Writer 

A ~eat writer of fiction and philoso-
phy, Nllcos Kazantzakis wrote in his clas-
sic novel, "Zorba the Greek," the medita-
tion, "The highest point a man can attain 
is not Knowledge, or Virtue, or 
Goodness, or Victory, but something 
even greater, more heroic, and more 
despairing: Sacred Awe'" 

To say it differently, the highest level 
we can attain as human beings is humili -
ty before the creator, whoever or wha tev-
er that may be. 

This means understanding that the 
uuth about God is utterly impossible for 
humans to comprehend, and that the best 
we can do is to humble ourselves before 
thc majcsty of the universe. 

I try to keep this quote in mi nd when-
ever I enter into religious or phi losophi-
ca l discussion. 

I am not always successfu l because, 
unfortunately, I cl ing to the idea that I 
am somehow on the right path to know-
ing those uni versal truths which all great 
thinkers su ive to know. 

In the end, I am always reminded that 
I am not a grea t thinker, and that even if 
I was, I would not be much closer to 
understanding the secrets of divine crc-
ation. 

. However, r fca ~ that too few people in 
thiS world , espeCially here on campus, 
take heed of the necessity for humility in 
rel igious life. 

I see this uagic phenomenon rearing its 
ugly head in the interaction between the 
various religious organizations on campus 
?nd this is a fact that needs to be changed 
If we are to uu1y be a successful communi-
ty of religiously diverse inhabitants. 

Of particular interest to me is a semi-
nar that took place recently on campus 
hosted by the Campus C rusade for 
Christ. 

!he leaders of major religious organi-
zanons on campus held a panel in which 
they discussed the differences between 
their respective religions. 

I did not attend this event, but I must 
say that everythin~ I thought would hap-
pen at the diSCUSSion actually did. 

According to the Guardian article that 
covered the panel , the speakers came 
away disappointed. 

Eacli of them recalled that the whole 
discussi?n centered around polite ways of 
not talking about the serious issues facing 
each and all of the major religions, while 

Rather than engaging in 
petty talk about how all 

religions are different, we 
should engage in serious 
talk about how we are all 
ultimately searching for 

the same thing ... I 
challenge myself and the 

members of each and 
every religious 

organization on campus to 
. .. work together for a 

greater understanding of 
each other. 

ignoring or refusing to talk about the 
similarities. 

That was the poi nt of the event. Each 
~nd .every ~rganization focused on press-
mg Its parocular point of view on attain-
ing victory and supposed virni~ over their 
rivals, wi thout offend ing them, of course. 
Such discussion is obviously lacking in 
"sacred awe." 

Rather than engaging in petty talk 

about how all religions are different, we 
should engage in serious talk about how 
we are all ultimately searching for the 
same thing. 

In a future seminar, the audience 
should be allowed to ask questions of any 
?f the speakers on the panel that would 

lI1c1u~e ~peakers from every religious 
orgamzanon on campus. 

For example, the Campus Crusade for 
C;hrist should not be the only organiza-

~on representing all of Christianity, see-
I~g a~ there are almost 30 Christian orga-
mzatlons on campus, many of which I am 
sure have vastly different views than the 
CCc. 

Interfaith discussion should be some-
thing we embrace wholeheartedly not 
something that we shy away 'from 
beca use controversial ideas may be 
uttered . 
. T his is a university, a place where 
Ideas are s~pposed to be exchanged freely 
and questions are supposed to be asked 
freely. Religion at a university should be 
no di fferent. 

I would partici pate in this event, and I 
think many others would too. 
. I~agine all of the organ i~tion s work-
mg III communion witll one another to 
find ~ommo~ ground and seek out ways 
to uti li ze their su ength in unity to make 
the campus a better place for worshi p and 
prayer. 

Above all , in searching for sacred awe 
of tile God we all worship in ollr own 
way, we would tra nscend the petty 
searches for victory and come to under-
stand our own fai th more completely. 

J chaUenge myself and the members 
of each and every religious organization 
on campu.s. to .work toward attaining 
~eat humili ty With our approach to reli -
81on, and to work together for a greater 
understanding of each other. 

Let us all seek to attain a sacred awe of 
creation together. 

5 OPINION 

A t the heart of Washington 
D.C. lies a tangled 
web of corruption, 
c;ollusion and injus-
tice. 

For the past three monms I have 
worked as a criminal defense inves-
tigator for Georgetown Law Center 
Criminal Justice Clinic, where I 
have walked in the uenches through 
the gritty underbelly of crime and 
punishment in the district. 

What I have seen and experi-
enced convinces me that the 
Meuopolitan Police Department 
and government attorneys have 
conspired together to form a legal 
system in the district that is toxic to 
anyone charged of a crime. 

I have seen first-hand how that 
thin blue line is crossed frequently 
and indifferently by the police. 
Jump-outs, unlawful searches and 
seizures, and police brutality are 
just a few corrupt tactics employed 
on a consistent basis by MPD offi -
cers. 

In a "jump-out," plainclothed 
MPD ofFcers drive in unmarked 
cars to the ghettos of the disuict. 
Then these officers jump out of 
their cars, grab and search random 
people, arresting anyone in posses-
sion of illegal substances or objects . 

During these jump-outs, the 
officers show utter disregard for 
the fourth amendment provision 
that no person be subjected to 
unlawful searches and seizures 
without probable cause. Of course, 
the officers try to justify their ille-
gal stop, search and seizure by 
claiming that they either received a 
tip from a confidential informant 
or that the area is a known drug 
area and therefore the jump-out 
was warranted. 

But those reasons do not justify 
the officers' sidestepping of the 
fourth amendment. Especially in 
light of the fact that these jump-
outs are tactics targeted solely 
toward those who live in the ghet-
tos and lower income housing -
minorities and the poor. If the 
MPD officers dared to conduct a 
jump-out in a middle or upper class 
neighborhood, all legal bloody hell 
would break loose and a newswor-
thy civil rights drama would be cre-
ated. 

A set of laws for the fortunate 
and the less fortunate does not 
ensure "equal protection" under 
the law as our constitution guaran-
tees; thus the use of police jump-
outs must be outlawed. 

Moving on to police brutality. 
Some of the police officers I've 

spoken to in the sixth and seventh 
disuicts of Washington will readily 
admit that, "You could police dif-
ferent across the river," meaning 
that in that area of Anacostia, the 
city'S poorest and most drug-ridden 
neighborhoods, a cop could get 
away with "working it rough." And 
"o,yorking it rough" is code (or the 
unnecessary use of excessive force, 
a.k.a. police brutali ty. 

T he cops know how to work the 
ystcm to their favor when faced 

with a tense situation that spi rals 
out of control, leavi ng the cop with 
a bloody and ' beaten perpeuator. 
The cop promptly files a disorderly 
conduct arrest and, like magic, 
worry over an internal affairs inves-
tigation vanishes. 

But the magic isn't really magic 
at all , because fi ling the disorderly 
conduct arrest makes the alleged 
victim of police brutality a defen-
dant. And who cares about defen-
dants? Certainly not most cops, 
their upervisors or pro ecuting 
attorneys. Therefore , the cops are 
off the hook. 

This rampant police corruption

Editor: 
In Emily Vizzo's recent article, 

"Protesting for Peace" (Nov. 19), 
she describes her uip up to our 
campus to attend an antiwar con-
ference. We would like to applaud 
her for accurately representing the 
views of these people, yet also 
scold her for so misrepresenting 
their motivations and goals. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

First, the praise. She is right to 
quote them as claiming that the 
most dangerous man in the world 
is the president of the United 
States. However, the antiwar pro-
testers do not mean tha t he is the 
leader of a nation that has been 
attacked and is determined to 
defeat those who have dedared 
war on her own people. 

No, rather the protesters were 
speaking along the lines of "Bush 
is the world's greatest terrorist." 
They routinely carry .igns lJ1at 
read this. On the evening of Sept. 
II, at a rally on the UC Berkeley 
campus, some even proclaimed 
that the WTC attacks were nearly 
perfect and would have been total-
ly perfect if only they had succeed-
ed in killing the president. We 
should know. We were there. Also, 
she quotes a "poet" who declares 
that "the world is dominated by 
imbecilic assholes." 

Ths is uue - the vast majority 
of the human race is not made up of 
angels. What is particularly fitting 
is that the conference also appears 
to be dominated by imbecilic 355-
holes, wishing death upon a man 
(George W. Bush) beeause they dis-
agree with him, sometimes openly 
reveling in the carnage in N ew York 
and ideologically defending the 
enemies of their country while at 
the same time refusing even to 
praise that country for providing 
them the opportunity to do so. We 
should know. We were there. 

THURSDAY, N OVEMBER 29, 2001 

N ow for our blame. First, she 
quotes the "fi ve to seven million 
Afghans will die" figure. Ths figure 
was arrived at before the snuming 
advance of the Northern Alliance 
opened up land roads from 
Uzbekistan and the Bagram airport 
was seized by British u oops, which 
greatly facilitate food transport to 
the Afghan people. Indeed, as we 
write this, 8,000 more tons of food 
than before arrive in Afghanistan. 
As the airports are brought into ser-
vice and overland convoys increase, 
even more food will find its way 
into Afghanistan. 

If there is any widespread star-
vation, it will not be due to the 
United States, but rather the 
Taliban, and will be confined to 
Taliban areas, as the previous 
years' famines in Afghanistan 
were. As much as she and other 
antiwar protesters loathe to admit, 
the United States and Britain are 
not the bad guys, nor are they sen-
tencing millions of Afghans and 
tens of thousands of their own sol-
diers to death. The situation right 
now is more Paris, 1944 than 
Vietnam, 1969. 

Also, she, perhaps unwittingly, 
represents these activists as pos-
sessing "fierce idealism." N othing 
could be further from the uuth on 
the Berkeley campus. Rather, 
these people are professional pro-
testers and activists, often lurking 
on multi -year graduate student 
fellowships or taking seven or 

eight years as an undergraduate. 
T hey move from cause to cause 
like locusts moving from plant to 
plant. Affi rmative .Action? Done. 
Palesti nians vs. Israel? Done. 
G lobalization? Done. Election 
lO00? Done. You get the idea. 

I f she had wanted to see u uc 
bravery and idealism that wasn't 
backed up by a horde of lawyers or 
an army of fe llow students ready to 
riot at the moment a single one 
was arrested, she would have done 
better to come to a meeting for the 
Berkeley College Republ icans, 
who have been counterprotesting 
at the antiwar rallies and staging 
their own pauiotic rallies on cam-
pus. 

Unlike the antiwar people, they 
don't have the ACLU protecting 
our freedom of speech. The cam-
pus police stand by idly as our lit-
erature is stolen and burned. 
Reports of assaul t by the dominant 
"idealistic protesters" go ignored. 
Yet in spi te of all this, they still 
carry on expressing their ideas, 
fighting what they see as wrong 
and refusing to be intimidated by 
the majori ty of the campus. Tell 
me, who are the idealists? Ask us 
- we know. 

We were there at the book 
burnings, the assaul ts, the thefts 
and the u iumphs of pauiotism. 
We are the u ue idealists, not the 
cynical and enuenched cadre of

Column: 
~despread corruption 
taints law enforcement 
Continued from page 5 
has distorted and blurred the thin 
blue line between what is consid-
ered acceptable and unacceptable 
police conduct beyond recognition, 
leaving people's civil rights lying 
like abandoned road kill beside the 
edge of the road. 

I have personally seen govern-
ment anorneys lise questionable and 
downright wllawfullyobtained evi-
dence fo charge and seek a convic-
tion. For instance, when a person is 
arrested because they were in pos-
session of drugs seized in an uncon-
stitutional jump-out, the govern-
ment anorneys proceed full steam 
ahead and charge that person. 

The Georgetown Criminal 
Justice Clinic defends many defen-
dants who have been victims of 
jump-outs and are being charged 
because of it. Many times, these 
search and seizures are thrown out 
in court as unconstitutional, but for 
the most part, they are not. It real-
ly depends on the judge's mood. 
Thus, the practice continues while 
the civil rights of the city's minori -
ty and poor are trampled down to 
mere dust. . 

The fact that government attor-
neys prosecute cases in which the 
key evidence has been ill egally 
obtained is a travesty, not only 
because it is a blow to our justice 
system but because it sanctions the 
illegal actions of the police who 
obtained that evidence. And thus 
the cycle of police and prosecution 
corruption continues unchecked. 

I think what ' is forgonen most 
and what must be reiterated time 
and time again is the fact that a per-
son is innocent until proven gui lty. 
We are all innocent until proven 
guilty, no matter if we are ri ch or 
poor, Latino or white. 

The ironic thing is that while 
the district is viewed as the perfect 
model of democracy, justice and 
liberty for our country and the 
entire world, deep in its heart lies a 
quagmire of corruption, collusion 
and injustice. 

It is high time for the district to 
redeem itself in the eyes of its peo-
ple and of the world. It must rid 
itself of the corrupt police and 
prosecutor practices that run the 
legal system. 

Because once equality and fair-
ness under the law are lost, there is 
no turning back. It's down the slip-
pery slope for the entire country, 
taking our constitutional guaran- -
tees sliding down with it.

A lesson in what not to get for the holidays 
Pick gifts with loads of love, and, of course, good taste 
By KECIA R. FELTON 
Staff Writet 

, Last year, my then-boyfriend's 
sister, Suzie, out of the goodness 
of her heart, bought me a fantastic 
gift for Christmas. She smiled a 
warm J ,OOO-kilowan smile as she 
handed me the beautifully 
wrapped package and on 
Christtnas Jay, as my cup runneth 
over, I thought about the warmth 
she exuded when she handed me 
the special gift. I opened it slowly 
with my family members huddled 
around in anticipation, and that's 
wben I pulled out a package of 
socks. 

That's right - socks. 
1 don't think that 1 had ever 

brandished a holey pair of socks in 
fron t of her. I don't think tha t we 
had ever exchanged misty, if-I-
only-had-another-pair stories 
prior to this random show of, er, 
affection. In fact, to my recollec-
tion,' I had never expressed an 
affinity for foot-warming apparel 
at any time. Therefore, I cannot 
understand why on Earth Suzie 
felt the need to buy me a package 
of plain white athletic tube socks. I 
would rather have received noth-
ing at all. 

Now, please don't misunder-
stand me. Anytime someone 
reaches into their pocket to buy 
something for me, I am apprecia-
tive. I am eternally grateful for 
extensions of time, energy or 
money when they are genuine and 
sincere. Using Christtnas as a time 
to say "1 love you" waters down 
the sentiment as it is, but buying 

QliIl K TURN ·\ROUND 

gifts out of obligation carries no 
warm sentiments at all. Buying 
pointless gifts for people who do 
not mean enough to you to put a 
little thought into the purchase is a 
waste of everyone's time. Thus, 1 
did not appreciate the socks. 

Once again, people turned out 
in droves to the shopping malls the 
day after Thanksgiving. The post-
holiday sales had consumers trip-
ping over themselves (quite literal-
ly when a woman was nearly tram-
pled to death over the holiday 
weekend while shopping) to get 
that perfect something for that 
special someone. Spare me. The 
last time I checked, K-Mart does-
n't market a hug my size. 

It seems a little rhetorical to say 
outright, but here it goes: 
Meaning cannot be found in a box. 

Every year, I marvel at the bil-
lions of dollars spent by Americans 
desperately trying to make up for 
the neglect they show their loved 
ones the other 364 days of the year. 
And then, as soon as the lights are 
packed away, so is the loving con-
sideration that came out of the 
attic with them. With the vanish-
ing act the holiday bird always 
pulls, also quick to disappear is the 
reconciliation of family differences 
that surfaces every holiday season. 

Wal-Mart reported record sin-
gle-day sales ofs 1.2 5 billion on the 
day-after-Thanksgiving sales 
bonanz.a, and I am sure many peo-
ple enthralled with rock-bottom 
prices forgot about those they were 
shopping for (if they ever really 
had them in mind to begin with). 
At the risk of sounding trite, 1 

would rather be constantly loved 
and appreciated than momentarily 
spoiled with impersonal wares and 
subsequently forgonen. 

I have raised this argument to a 
number of friends, and each time 
it usually ends with them spewing, 
"Fine, I guess this year you 're not 
getting anything then." Well , fine 
- have it your way. Because if you 
haven't called me in [wo months, 
then chances are 1 wouldn't miss 
your gift anyway. And if you could 
easily cross my name off of the 
present in a gift-exchanging emer-
gency and present it to another 
person without any loss of mean-
ing, then I don't want your minis-
cule token of affection anyway. 

Another friend fired, "I haven't 
seen you refuse anything lately!" 
This is only because it is easier to 
toss things under my bed or in the 
back of my closet than brave the 
hellacious after-Christtnas crowds. 
Thanks, but no thanks. If 1 don't 
like to battle with venomous shop-
pers before Christtnas, you defi-
nitely won't catch me out after the 
blessed event. (And to that friend : 
I still have the Vanilla Bean bath-
and-body lotion you gave me from 
last year. You didn't bother to ask if 
I like vanilla - yuck - and I 
haven't used a drop.) 

Another important rebuttal 
that was made concerned our new-
found patriotic duty to shop. It is 
true that consumerism is deeply 
woven into the American fabric, 
and to halt consumption would 
surely be to our own detriment. 
The economy would probably col-
lapse if all Americans collectively

decided to boycott the shopping 
malls, and I would never make 
such a foolish suggestion. I would 
advise, however, thinking about 
the person you are buying for (if 
your sense of nationalism has 
called you to shopping duty) 
before making the decision to buy. 

Does the person already have a 
pair of slippers with huge ducks 
staring at each other? Does the 
person have an aversion to ducks? 
Ask yourself relevant questions 
concerning your loved one~ per-
sonality and likes before you 
splurge on recyclable gifts. 

This year, my family is not get-
ting anything from me. First, they 
know that I am broke as a joke and 
a pocketful of gumbails from the 
quarter machines is asking too 
much. But secondly, and most 
importantly, I do not buy into the 
hype that advertisers assert. 
"Nothing says they're special like 
(our product here)" is simply not 
going to work on me this year. 

Despite my resolution to avoid 
the malls, I have compiled a small 
list to assist your Christmas shop-
ping. Do not buy your friends and 
family: 

I. Fruitcake (or nuts, popcorn 
tins and other preserved edibles-
unless they absolutely love them). 

2. Slippers (unless their favorite 
pair is talking back to them). 

3. Underwear (unless they are 
the sexy variety, and then if you 
know someone this well you 
should be doing better than thisl) 

4. Socks (of any kind) .

While I believe that readers 
should be able to interpret resolu-

tion RCC passed several weeks ago 
in no way condemns The Koala, 
even by the most liberal of inter-

I would ask that before your 
writers attempt to interpret what 
resolutions mean, they read them 
first. The RCC resolution regard-
ing the controversy surrounding 
The &alii states that "the Revelle

Interpret that as you will, but I

Video of post-game celebration examined for 
Los Angeles police accused of brutality of fans after a USC football game 

LOS ANGELE - Problems 
after a USC-UCLA football game 
twO weeks ago arose when students 
stormed the Los Angeles 
Memorial Coliseum field. and 
there is little evidence of police 
brutality. Department of Public 
Safety Deputy Chief Bob Taylor 
said. 

Despite student reports. the 
reaction when hundreds of 'stu-
dents rushed the field was not an 
eruption of total chaos. Taylor said 
Tuesday. 

Coliseum and university offi-
cials now are developing possible 
solutions to ensure such an inci-
dent is not repeated. 

Suggestions for solutions to the 
recent problems with crowd con-
trol at the Coliseum were voiced 
during a meeting Nov. 21. but no 
conclusions have been reached. 
university officials said. 

"There will be many more 
meetings in the future," said Don 
Ludwig. director of recreational 
sports. "We have a lot more work 
to do." 

Representatives of USC faculty. 
administrators and students. 
including Taylor. Assistant Vice 
President of Student Affairs 

Cynthia Cherrey and Student 
Senate President Hema Patel, par-
ticipated in the meeting. 

The group watched a video 
taken by members of the athletic 
department that captured the 
moments after the game when 
many fans claim they were tram-
pled by crowds and mistreated by 
event staff and law enforcement 
officers. 

"A lot of people went to the 
meeting with the perception in 
mind that there was this wild melee 
that took place. and just watching 
the video served to dispel a lot of 
that." Taylor said. 

The video has "nt been released 
publicly. and d:ere ,~ave been no 
announcements "ll~"': yet for its 
release in the near furure. 

Among the possible solutions 
discussed at the Nov. 21 meeting 
was the implementation of some-
thing Taylor called "pressure-relief 
tactics." The approach is intended 
to reduce congestion in seating 
areas and involves allowing stu-
dents onto the field and then 
immediately directing them out of 
the Coliseum. 

Garrett Brown. an undergradu-
ate majorin~ in busine~. said while 

such an approach might make the 
environment safer. it still takes 
away from the college tradition of 
celebrating with the team after a 
big victory. 

"While it would eliminate many 
of the safety concerns. 1 think it 
would still take away from the idea 
of being with the team and cele-
brating." Brown said. 

Rushing the field is a violation 
of Los Angeles Municipal Code 
Sec. 41.56, stating. "It shall be 
unlawful for any person at any sta-
dium to leave the area or areas set 
aside for spectators and enter upon 
the grounds. field." 

Taylor Williams. a senior 
m2joring in accounting, said pres-
sure-relief tactics may worsen the 
situation. 

"I would examine that ordi-
nance to see how relevant it is and 
when it was drafted," Williams 
said. "I would also look at all the 
universities across the country that 
don't even try to keep students 
from rushing the field. where it's 
considered a tradition." 

Rushing the field is also prohib-
ited at the Rose Bowl. for many of 
the same reasons it is banned at the 
Coliseum. 

"There are stadiums across the 
country where storming the field 
after the game [is allowed). If that's 
their posture, that's fine," said Lt. 
Alex Uribe of the Pasadena Police 
Department. "We at the Rose 
Bowl see it as a danger to the pub-
lic. The tearing down of a goalpost 
could easily injure or kill some-
one." 

Stanford University also pro-
hibits rushing the field at football 
games and has an eight-foot-high 
fence separating the field from the 
stands. For many games. the ~ 
10 rows of seating are closed ' 
and covered wi th tarps . . 

Lt. Laura Wilson of Stanford's 
department of public safety said 
crowd control is an issue taken very 
seriously. 

Two years ago the Santa Clara 
County Crowd Control 
Management team was used at the 
football game between Stanford 
and UC Berkeley to ensure safety. 
Wuson said the plan was contro-
versial because officers dressed in 
riot gear. 

"That definitely sent a message 
that rushing the field is not accept-
able." he said.

expected such an eruption on the 
field after the game. 

"You watch games on TV where 
students are rushing the field, and 
it's all a big celebration," Hay said. 
"It was not good to see students. 
my classmates. get beaten down in 
front of my face." 

Williams said he saw one 
handcuffed student get punched 
in the face by a member of event 
staff. 

"If [rushing the field] was 
allowed [this year). it would have 

lprevented injury and probably even 
contributed to school spirit." 
Williams said. 

• 

Brown said students on the field 
after the game might not have 
wanted to be there. 

MWhether or not you want to 
get onto the field. there is a gener-
al thrust in that direction that will 
ultimately push you onto the field." 
Brown said. "And for students who 
may be in that position. to be met 
with a hostile police force is not 
good."

Construction: 
Reverse bonds may 
need to be issued 
Continued from page 1 
of capita l planning at UCSD. 

"The passing of the bond mea-
sure is essential so that there was no 
ga p in funding. Given there's a 
budget crisis. it appears now that 
the idea is to go ro the voters in 

ovember 2002." 
Patricia Romero. a spokesper-

son from the UC Office of the 
President's budget division. said 
that due to the state's inability to 
sell bonds following the expiration 
of the current GOB. the state 
might resort to funding UC capital 
improvements by i51luing lease rev-
enue bonds.

siveness toward women and under-
represented groups has sunk to a 
new low." Dynes said. "While such 
hatefu l speech may be protected by 
the First Amendment. it is a clear 
violation of our UCSD Principles 
of Community and our goal of a 
hate-free campus." 

Before the latest Koala was post-
ed • • Vlartincz stated in an e-mail to 
admin istration that members of 
Tbe Koala disrupted a 1\ lovimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano/a de Aztlan 
meeting and took photographs of 
him. 

"The only open Chicanalo spac~ 
on this campus was interrupted by 
this group only to try and somehow 
retaliate against the statements r 
made." Martinez stated. "It was a 
rather disturbing event. and honest-
ly. r am feeling harassed." 

Gregory was also aware of the 
possible need to find other funding 
sources. 

"We're trying to do whatever 
we can to continue planning build-
ings and ro somehow substitute 
funding for construction," he said. 

Other budget allocations were 
made toward UCSD projects for 
the coming year. Romeru said these 
projects may also need funding 
from lease revenue bonds. 

The Pharmaceutical Sciences 
Building will undergo construction 
in 2003 and drawings are currently 
in progress. The $17 million build-
ing will be located behind the exist-
ing School of Medicine on Osler 
Lane.

Liddle said he thinks that 
Martinez's reaction to The Koala 
this year is not representative of the 
UCSD student body. 

"His life experiences growing 
up have appeared to make him 
hypersensitive to race issues," 

'I want to commend 
Ernesto on the 
maturity and dignity he 
has shown during this 
unfortunate incident. I 
hope the staff of Koala 
might attain that same 
maturity and dignity:

utilities caused by the new engi-
neering buildings. 

Plans for the Student Academic

"If I were a high school student 

on a tour and I saw The Koala, I 
would definitely scra tch UCSD off 
my list." Avitia said . 

Dynes apologized to Martinez 
on behalf the "campus community" 
and himself. and that hateful 
speech erodes the campus environ-
ment. 

"I want to commend ErnestO 
on the maturity and dignity he 
has shown during this unfortu-

The Whos 
come alive at 
the Globe 
Theater adaptation of 
Dr. Seuss' classic an 
annual holiday tradition 
By SABRINA MORRIS 
Staff Writer 

O r. Seu,s once said, "Children want the same thmg we want: to laugh, to be challenged, to be entertained 
,lnU uelighted ." Those very qua lities are 
dc ll vered on stage at The G lobe 
fhcJtres. 

The Globe g;lth e r~ its loyal patro ns 
II prefers to call "tradi tion" - of "I low 
the Gri nch Sto le Christmas!" 
RcmamlJ1g true to the ,rary's original 
creJtor, Dr. Seuss, the Globe hOMS a 
ti ne producti on of this memorable chil -
dren's ,rary. 

I lowev!!r, thi ' particular sea,on 's 
arrangement cannot compare to previ-
o us years' perfo rmances. 

With veteran actors G uy Paul playing 
the Gri nch and Rusty Ro s playing the 
dog Max, Dr. cuss' Clilristmas classic 
comes alive on stage. 

Al though both stars brilliantly pull 
o ff a delightfu l and humorous perfor-
mance, the duo could have used another 
week of rehea rsa l. When they fumbl ed a 
few times on stage with various props, 
Lhey were forced to noticeably impro-
\'I se, thereby breaking the rhyming 
>cheme of the script. 

T he res t of the cast gives lively per-
formances with strong singing voices 
and excellent line delivery. Sti ll , the 
unique rhyming scheme seems constant-
ly inte rrupted with improvisational 
cover-ups. 

The costu mes inspire the play and 
arc one of its most successful contribu-
tions to the overall production. The 
\ \ 'hos of Whovi lle make their debut in 
curly-Q-toed shoes, rounded out body 
proportions and ruddy-cheeked smil ing 
fa ces. 

The tousled green fu r and menacing 
makeup of the G rinch eleva te the char-
acter and augment his presence. Paul 
adds his own touch of humor that enrap-
tu res the audience. 

Bnnging us a littl e closer to the cen-
ter of the heartfelt humanity in the play 
is character C indy-Lou Who, played by 
,\lary Frances McClay. Juxtaposed with 
the Witty character of the Grinch, 
,\lcClav stea ls the show with her sweet-
\'oiced songs and charm ing relaxation on 
stage. 

The se t design is 3ma7.i ngly close to 
the ongil~~! p~n -a~,d-ink illustrations of 
Dr. Seuss G nnch - a good gesulre to 
the producer and to Dr. Seuss. 

Al though thc show is meant most 
pecdlcall y for children, adults find 

thcmselves enjoyi ng it as well. Th e 
dlrcc tor, J ack O 'Brien, allows for 
moments of laughter for a mature audi -
ence with scenes that identify with the 
\\ OC., of being a parent duri ng C hristmas 
tlllle.

dren Jild the othcr half bClIlg profcs-

"Ouan s 11 " 
Who to look for: George Clooney, 

Brad Pitt, Man Damon,Julia Roberts and 
Andy Garcia. 

Story line: "Ocean s I I" is a Steven 
Soderbergh ("Erin Brokovich") remake of 
the Rat Pack film of the same name. 
Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has just been 
released from prison, and whats the fi rst 
thought on his mind? Rob three casinos 
for $150 million. Working with him on 
his crew of II is a card-shark (Pitt) and a 
pickpocket (Damon), among other crafty 
criminals. Using his ex-wife Tess 
(Roberts) to get to casino owner (Garcia), 
whom she is dating, Ocean quickly hatch-
es a plan that is guaranteed t l' . "j anything 
but smoothly. 

Outlook: $150 million alone is proba-
bly what it took to pay the salary of the 
Hollywood hotshots in this film. Roberts 
seems a little out of her league in this one; 
shc's just nor tough enough. It appears, 
however, that Pitt and Clooney may actu-
ally bc the onl y two peoplc with on-screen 
chemistry. If anything, this movic will 
serve as eye candy. Where else arc you 
going to find the megawatt grins o f Pitt, 
Roberts and Damon all on one screen?

"Thr Royal 7enmbfllllllS" 
Who to look for: Gene Hackman 
Anjelica I Iu ron, Gwyncth Paltrow, Bel~ 
Sti ll er, Luke Wilson, Bill Murray and 

-Danny G lover. 
to ry line: The Tenenbaums arc a 

famtly of geniuses. T he childrcn (Paltrow, 
Sti ll er and Wilson) who were award-wi n-
ning playwritcs, star tennis players and 
rea l-estate moguls before thcy hit pubcr-

ty, have been estrangcd from their father, 
Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman), for many 
years. Wanting to reconnect with his fam-
ily and his wife (Huston), Tenenbaum 
gives himsclf a six-weck prognosis to live 
as an excuse to bring the fami ly togcther. 

Outlook: Hackman docs cxcc llent 
comedy (remember his moment in drag in 
"The Bird Cage"?), and as Tenenbaum 
hes definitely going to exercise his talent. 
It'll be especia lly entertaining to see how 
Paltrow carries off as the moody play-
write. Directed by Wes Anderson, who 
brought us the off-center " Rushmore," 
"The Royal Tenenbaums" could prove to 
be a quirky winter hit. T heres nothing 
better than a fami ly crazier than your own 
during the holiday season. 

"Vonilla Sky" 
Who to look for: Tom Cruise, 

Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz. 
Story line: Mu ltitalented director-

wri tel' Cameron Crowe has ada pted the 
1998 Spanish film "Opcn Your Eyes" to 
bring us a morc cutting edge, New York-
version of the film . Cruise plays Din's 
lover - that is, until he mcets his soul-
mate,. Cruz, and consequently severs his 
relationship with the psychotically jealous 
Diaz (should this have been titled "Torn 
and Nicole's Story"?). After surviving a 
horrendous car crash and subsequently 
being accused of Diaz's murder, Cruise 
must somehow make things right. 
. Outlook: The most interesting thing 
IS that no one really knows what this film 
is about. Obviously we're dealing with 
two star-crossed lovers (Cruise and Cruz), 
but there could be an element of timewarp 
in addition to Cruise dealing with disfig-
urement. It's evident that tlungs start Out 
hunky-dory and then get ugly, which 
leaves this critic pretty skeptical. The only

Tyler, Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving. 

Story line: The first of a tri logy of fi lms 
from J .R. Tolkin's novels, "The Lord of the 
Rings" follows Frodo Baggins (Wood), a 
hobbit who comes into possession of a pow-
erful ring. Baggins' mission, should he 
choose to accept it, is to travel to the Cracks 
of Doom and destroy the ancient ring, t1ll1S 
ending the Dark Lords reign of terror. No 
easy task, considering the hordes of evil 
creatures out to stop him. But hey, what's a 
fairyta le without a little adventure? 

Outloolc A film to rival the computer 
graphics of "Star Wars" with a plot of its 
very own. Nevertheless, tllose who arc 
unf.1miliar \vith the life of Baggins may be 
unable to tell Legolus the elf from Gimli 
the dwarf and may ask, "Who the hell is 
Galadriel?" However, the lblkein faithful 
should be pleased. With his young gobs-
m3ckcd look, Wood is perfect as the unlike-
ly warrior, and tile rest of the cast looks 
promising as well. Seeing that audiences are 
going to be hit with three films over three 
years, we should probably decide now 
whether to become ardent Arwen ([yler) 
fans or give this hobbit the old heave-ho 
and save ourselves the trouble.

Various Artists

** 
Here's to a totally syn-

thetic Christmas. Forget 
Bing Crosby, here comes 
MTV. With its Total 
Request Live Christmas 
mix, MTV brings together 
pop and rock artists to 
make a genera lly dissatisfy-
in g- album. The perfor-
mances included on this 
this album range from 
teeny-bop pop to rock to 
orchestral. 

Willa Ford contributes 
her bad-ass blonde image 
wi th "Santa Baby, Gimme 
Gi mme Gimme." Her 
hypersexuality exudes itself 
through sensual beats a la 
Brimey Spears, an d know-
ing that "she wants to be 
bad" adds a twist to her 
lyrics. 

Her pop presence is 
accompanied by the likes 
of *NSYNC with "I Don't 
Wanna Spend One More 

Chrismlas Without You." 
*NSYNC, the MSG of 
music, manages to create 
another inexplicably tasty 
tune. 

Mark Mcgrath sings 
"Little Saint ick" in the 
usual jovial Sugar Ray tone. 
Other bands, like Blink-182 
with "I Won't Be Home For 
Chrismlas" and Weezer 
with "The Christmas 
Song," show us what good 
rocl: is. All three of these 
bands stay true to their 
unique styles. 

Despite the bad tracks 
like comedian Jimmy 
Fallon's "Snowball," this 
LP manages to surprise. 
Angela Via does soar 
through "C hristmas Wish" 
with a gifted voice. 
Speaking of gifted voices, 
Christina Aguilera does 
absolute honors to "Angels 
We Have Heard On 
High," blending time-hon-
ored songs and popular 
teen culture in the pure 
syrup of her angelic voca ls. 

The CD ends with 
"Christmas Canon" by the 
Trans-Siberian Orchestra, a 
track too conservative, too 
musically rich and too good 
to be on this mix. MTY, 
though V21iant in its attempt 
to filch our green by playing 
off holiday spirits :md the 
hopeful ly waning pop music 
rage, has managed ~o 
degrade Christmas.

Reggae Chanukah 
Alan Eder and Friends 

mr. e. records 

**** 
Listeners looking for 

Hannukah music have tra-
ditionally faced dauntingly 
slim pickings: the number 
of quality collections of 
Hannukah-themed music is 
ridiculously low. Sure, near-
ly every pop star on MTV 
feels obligated to share his 
or her Chrisonas cheer with 
the listening audi~nce, but 
such is not the case for those 
who celebrate Hannu.kah. 

However, celebrators of 
Chan.kah need despair no 
longer! The best thing to 
happen to Channukah since 
the advent of gelt is here, 
and its really rastafied. 

"Reggae Chanukah" 
seems like quite a juxtapo-
sition at fi rst glance. 
Traditional holiday songs 
in Hebrew are set to dis-
tinctly African, Carribbean 
and Latin beats. 

But the history of Jewish 

albums 
people and that of the 
African people and diaspora 
have notable similarity, with 
thcir respective surviva ls of 
enslavement and persecll-
tion. After all, African-
American slaves in tile 19th 
century identi ti ed witll and 
sang storie of anc ient 
Israel. ow modern Jews 
are returning the favor and 
contributing to cross-cul-
tural cro s-pollentation. 

The album combines 
these cultures with delightful 
success. This is not your zay-
deb's Hannukah music: In 
the newly created original 
pieces, the artists liberally 
borrow from Bob Marley'S 
thcmes of perseverence and 
liberation and his lyrical and 
musical styles. The West 
African dance drumming, 
which grooves beneath a 
medley of '·Hanerot 
Halalu," "S'veevon," 
"Chanukah" and "Oh 
Chanukah," will invigorate 
the festival of lights. And the 
hilarious "Latke Song" 
offers listeners a 
samba/mambo spin on 
Channukah - from the hol -
idays premier taste treats 
enthusiastic perspective. 

The album can be hard 
to find in record stores or 
from online retailers, but 
ships within 24 hours from

for the seder as well).

Whcn tlley say "The

the listener is swept back 
through the years to when 
we sat as small children by 
the fireside to watch the 
"Rudolph Chrisnnas

With Louis Armstrong's 
"Zat you Santa Claus," we 
are t1U'own into a world of 
raspy blues and tUmy trtun-
pets. Mel TOrlne gives us the 
warm and traditional "The

into a world where "chest-
nuts roast[ed] on an open

[were] sung by a choir."

The people demand, U2 delivers 
Bono's socially conscious performance beautifully excecuted 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

The U2 concert started at 7:30 p.m. That mean.t we had to leave San Diego at noon to give ourselves plen-
ty of time. So wi th pedal pressed to the 
metal, we were speeding across the desert 
to Las Vegas to watch U2 perform live. 

Fast-forward to 11:30 p.m ., and I am 
following the crowd leaving the Thomas & 
Mack Center on the University of Nevada 
Las Vegas campus. My head is spiruling and 
my ears are ringing, which are the marks of 
a good concert, but I couldn't shake the 
thought that if U2 wasn't U2, their live act 
would be pretty cheesy. 

There was that touching moment when 
Bono embraced the American flag, or that 
other momem when Bono pulled a fan up on 
stage to play guitar with the rest of the band. 
Then there was the moment when the mas-
s!ve video screens behind the band scrolled 
the names of every victim from the flights 
that went down on Sept. 11, including New 
York City police officers and firefighters . 

It's all very touching, but it could have 
been pretty sappy if some second-rate band 
tried to (.lull th.: same stunts . 

'But U2 isn't a second-rate band. They 

Concert 
REVIEW 

are socially conscious superstars who have 
fought for peace in their native Ireland as 
well as around the world. They have been 
at the forefront of the "Drop the Debt" 
campaign, which calls every superpower in 
the world to cancel third-world debt. 

U2 can afford to pull these stums and 
pull them off beautifully. 

They ran a flawless three-hour set that 
included songs from the old days, such as 
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "I Will 
Follow," as well as more recem ones like 
"New York" and "Elevation." Bono even 
brought out the familiar spotlight during an 
incredible performance of "Bullet the Blue 
Sky." 

Bono's voice wasn't top notch, but he 
saved it for the times when he needed it. 
The Edge was incredible, as usual. Larry 
Mullen and Adam Clayton were rock 
steady. 

Any doubt that fans had after U2's 
"Popmart" tour have been erased as U2 
continues to "elevate" to legendary starus.

with an Oscar. While "Ali" may 
"float like a butterfly" from all the 
publicity, it probably won't "sting 
like a bee." As Ali romps around the 
ring and the bedroom, we can't help 
but wonder how many egos this 
film helped to fuel. No actor (and I 
don't care how much you worked 
out, Will) can entertain better than 
The Champ himself whcn hc's 
doing what he does best. 

Soulful songstress kicks off U.S. tour and wins over audiences

.1 bang on Nov. 22 at Canc's 

Ihr Jml Gri ll. If )'ou' rc a skcptic of 
rClnc'lrnJtion, you obviously have 
not ,cen Costa live, because ,he 
command the stage as if shc were 
chan neli ng the spiri t of Janis 
Joplin. vVhile her single, "Likc a 
Feather," ga ined Costa some 
notice this past yea r, she is still a 
relative rookie of the rock scene. 
I [owcver, if Friday night 'S show is 
any indicator, Costa is about to 
become huge. 

Of course, the publicity buzz 
surroundi ng Costa is CJui te well 
known by now - born the 
daughter of fa mous 
producer/arranger Don Costa, 
Costa began performing at the 
age of fi ve, opening for heavy-
weights such as Don 110 and The 
Police. \Vhilc her press bio reads 
like a who's who of music, por-
trayi ng Costa as an "old pro," 
Costa is still fee ling her way into 
the music industry. 

"It's kind of more something the 
record company likes to run with," 
Costa said, referring to her father's 
famous collaborator, including 
Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, 
Sanuny Davis J r. and Sly StOne. 

This is Costa's first U.S. head-
lining tour - her first chance to 
show everyone just what she's 
made of. 

"This is our first actual, proper 
U.S. tour. We've only ever done 
promotional shows around town 
,0 there's not been a rcal opportu-
nity for fans to come unti l now," 
Costa aid.

Outlook: Trying to break away 
from his famous facial contortions, 
Carey has fOUJld himself another

still charm his audiencc with 
comedic timing alone, it may not 
be enough for an already tried-and-

Story line: Based on Annie

novel of the same name, "The

mystery. VVhen Quayle'S (Spacey's) 
estranged wife (Blanchett) dies, he

and returns to his childhood horne 
in ewfoulldland. M9ving with his 
two daughters into a dilapidated 
house during a seemingly perpetual 
winter, Quoyle embarks on a peri-
od of elf-discovery. Finding a job 
as a reporter for the local newspa-
per, Quoyle quickly begins to dis-
cover the layers of mystery around 
him, including those of the wOlllen 
he is falling in love with (Moore).

man and champion with the women. 
Contributing to the career of Ali 
(Smith) is Don King (Williamson) 
and Malcom X (Van Peebles). As we 
follow Ali through the rise of his 
career, we realize (if we didn't 
already know) that he battled not 
only his opponents, but also public 
opinion and the Vietnam draft. 

ews" shares the same director as 
"Chocolat," a visually appealing 
film in its own right. Plus, with 
Spacey taking a new approach as a 
character full of innocence and 
Blanchett playing a woman caught 
on the wild side, entertainment is 
guaranteed. If anything, seeing the 
snow of Newfoundland will remind 
us why we all live in San Diego. 

Judging by the line that gath-
ered outside her backstage door 
aftcr the show, Costa should have 
no trouble winning over audi-
ences on her 19-date tOur, which 
will wrap up in Tuscon, Ariz. just 
before Christmas. Her set, which 
fcatured most of the songs off of 
her aibulll , " Everybody Got 

Their Something," lasted about 
an hour. However, the audience 
cheered for an encore that seemed 
to be truly spontaneous. If you 
have yet to hear of Costa, make a 
note: VVhether she really has the 
soul of Janis or is just the next 
rock goddess, she's definitely got 
"something!" 

Outlook: Smith obviously 
wanted to fight more than aliens 
and he wanted to look good while 
doing it - may~e even coming out

'Another teen movie,' but this 
one is likely to succeed 
Mindless laughs abound in energetic, 
entertaining spoof of new genre classics 
By ANNE CONG·HUYEN 
Staff Writer 

Following the Wayans brothers' "Scary Movie," an example of comedy spoofs on tried-and-
true film genres, "Not Another 
Teen Movie" anempts to satirize 
the ever-popular teen movie. 

"Not Another Teen Movie" fol-
lows the life of "the pretty-ugly 
girl," Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh), 
as she slowly wins the heart of "tlle 
popular jock," Jake Wier (Chris 
Evans), after he b.et "tI\t' c~~ky 
blonde guy" and "the luir _ lJ!:rck 
guy" that he can turn her into the 
prom queen. Is this starting to 
sound familiar? 

Following the "She's All That" 
formula, "Teen Movie" manages to 
imitate every teenage film from 
"Sixteen Candles" to "Pretty in 
Pink" to "Bring it On." The prob-
lem \vitll trying to encompass so 
many movies is that it fail to flow 
and sometimes becomes hard to 
follow, especially if you haven 't 
seen the movies it tries to mock. 

Director Joel Gallen :~ first fea-
ture-length film, " otAnotllerTecn 
Movie" fniles to be a movie that he 
"was able to shape ... into a story and 
really develop." But it does succeed, 
however, at being purely entertain-
ing. Prior to "Not Another Teen 
Movie," Gallen had mostly directed 
hort films and produced concerts. 

His inexperience at directing fuJl-
length fihns can be seen in scenes 
that are more appropriate for televi-
sion rather than movies. 

The very young cast of new-
comers, however, proved to be 

Film 
REVIEW 

quite successful , despite the bad 
writing. In leading roles, Leigh and 
Chris perform as well as can be 
expc.:ted for a film of this genre. 
Both show the same amount of tal-
ent you'd expect from more "sea-
soned" actors like Freddie Prinze, 
Jr. or Rachel Leigh Cook. 

The one person who nearly 
steals the show and shines in his 
perfectly casted role as Ricky (a 
take-off on the obsessive Ducky 
from "Pretty in Pink") is Eric 
Jungmann. Jungmann plays the 
obsessive and overly flamboyant 
best friend who is in love with 
Janey. 

The equally energetic 
]unj,"llann said, "[Ricky isJ so head-
over-heels, and you can just see it in 
everything that he does - and in 
, ot Another Teen Movie,' it 's 
satirical." 

As Leigh aid , "It was very alive 
[on the setJ. Obviously being young 
and an actor is a lot more di fficult 
in my eyes ... but we had a lot of 
fun with it." 

This overall excitement and 
energy from the cast can be felt in 
every scene, as well as within the 
great soundtrack, which includes 
music from other teen movies such 
as "Pretty in Pink." 

Although at times it's hard to 
watch due to gross visual gags and

This refresher 
course in 'civ' 
won't put yctU 
to sleep 
Latest installation of 
addictive game may 
be hazardous to 
grades and social life 
By CHARUE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

I t has been II years since "Sid Meier's Civilization" rocked the gaming world with its con· 
cept of a turn-based game that 
combined intelligent gameplay and 
add ictive fun . So why fix ome-
thing that's not broken? The third 
version of "Civilization" proves yet 
again that turn-based gaming is 
alive and well. 

For those that were in the uark 
during their teenage yea rs, 
"Civilization" allows you to start a 
small village and build it into an 
empire. Against you are other 
nations played by the computer. 
Trade, natural resources, technolo-
gy, growth and war are all elements 
factoring in growth of your empire. 
\Vhat makes "Civilization" so 

Video Game 
REVIEW 

addictive is its complex yet stimu-
lating gameplay. 

From waging war to encourag-
ing trade, "Civi li zation" makes the 
player, whether a paci fi st or war-
hawk, an omnipotent controller of 
his nation 's destiny. 

Not only does "Civilization ru" 
greatly improve graphics from the 
previous versions, it adds many 
new levels and dimensions of 
gameplay. Although the graphics 
aren't the best, that's not what the 
game is all about. What makes 
"Civilization" 0 great is its god-
like feel of the world.· 

With the addition of culture, it 
is now possible to win without 
wa~ ng war against the entire 
world. Ever wonder why the 
French hate American culture? 
Now's your chance to feel tlle full 
wrath of pop culrure. 

Another new dimension is nat-
ural resources. In the previous 
games, resources were merely trad-
ed between empire ' for money. In 
"Civilization lIl ," resources are now 
needed in order to produce certain 
weapons and grow in knowledge. 
Wanna nuke the world? You're 
going to need to find uranium 
before you build those nukes. 

Diplomacy is greatly enhanced 
in this sequeL Options such as 
trade embargos and mutual 
alliances are now possible. Have 
you ever wondered what it was like 
to be isolated from the world? If 
you have a golden tounge, you can 
win by being elected the leader of 
the world. 

Borders are also a new addition 
to the game. Unlike the earlier 
games, you can-no longer roam 
free around the world. 

Before plotting to take over ~e 
world, there's just one word of 
advice: Be prepared to live like a 
hermit, because the only thing 
you'll be doing is playing 
"Civilization Ill."

DVDs are holiday treats 
'Matrix' backstory, 'Crazy' scenes are nice extras 
"Matrix Revisited" 

"Matrix Reloadcd" is being 
released in 2003 , and if that wait is 
too long, then "Matrix Revisited," a 
companion piece to "The Matrix," 
packs just enough extra~' to satsify 
hard-core fans. 

"Matrix Revisited" is a docu-
mentary that not only covers "The 
Matrix," but also gives a sneak pre-
view of upcoming sequels. T he 
documentary is almost two hours 
long and goes into detai l about the 
making of the original fi lm. From 
the initial idea of the "T he Matrix" 
to the upcoming anime shorts, the 
DVD captures the creative brain-
storming of the crew and cast of 
"The Matrix." 

Wi th tidbits such as Keanu 
Reeves acting with a spinal injury 
and the actors' martial-arts prepa-
ration. the disc seems more like a 
secondary DVD that is now includ-
ed in many special two-DVD sets. 

This brings up the monetary 
issue: If you 're not into "The 
Matrix" or you're not a hard-core 
fan, then this DVD is not worth 
buying. But it does make a decent 
rental.

"Crazy/Beauti fu l" 
Jo hn Stockwell's "Crazyl 

Beauti ful" brings an impressive dis-
. play of fearures to its DVD, which 

is in stores now. The DVD version 
of the film fearures deleted scenes. 
audio commentaries, thea trical 
trailers and a documentary on the 
making of the movie. 

T here are five deleted scenes 
that are approximately a minute 
long each. T hose who liked the 
film would be interested in the 
scenes, which can be viewed with 
commentary from the director. 
There is also audio commentary for 
the trailer from Stockwell and com-
mentary throughout the film from 
both Kirsten Dunst and Stockwell . 
T he documentary provides keen 
insight in to both the thought 
process behind the movie and the 
casting. 

Overall, this is an above-average 
DVD in terms of its fearures, which 
will keep fans of the movie occu-
pied and satisfied for hours. Even 
those who weren't too thrilled with 
the movie can appreciate the added 
bonuses that the DVD brings to 
the table.

Christian Brothers 
favored to win it all 
Continued from page 21 
defeated Ashland 4-0, Mercyhurst 
2 - I, and Truman State 2 -0, en 
route to the semifinals. After bare-
ly losing the Division U champi-
onship game last year to UCSD, 

ortllcrn Kentucky looks toward 
a more fulfilling culmination to its 
substantia l 200 I season. 

Throughout his fi\ ~ years as 
head coach at ortllern Kenuld:y 
University, Bob Sheehan has com-
piled a 80-20-5 record. Betsy 
Moore, the GLVC Player of the 
\ 'c.!r and a two-time All-American, 
leads the 'orse with 18 goa ls and 
17 assi ts on the year, including 
fi,·c goals in 200 1 postseasOli play. 
JUllJor goalkeeper Megan Zalla 
and senIor defenders Amanda 
Trout and E"3 Broeg lead the stur-
dy, orthcrn Kentucky defense. 

"Northern Kentucky will defi-
nitely challenge us," \Vensel said. 
" \Ve dominated the game last 
year, but this year they know our 
playmg style. [The game] will 
come down to who wants it the 
tnost. '· 

In the other semifinal match, 
the second-ranked Christian 
Brother.. Lady Buccaneers from 
'cw IlJmpshirc will challenge 

the top- eeded Franklin Pierce 
Ravens of Tennes ee. 

The Lad}, Buccaneers are the 
highe~t-ranked team, in any sport, 
in Christian Brothers Univcrsity 
history. They cnter this year's 
NCAA Division 1I Championship 
tournament with an unblemished 
record of 21-0. The Lady 
Bucc<lneers scored an CAA 
record 162 goals in the 200 1 sea-
son, ~ha ttering m e previous 
record by 33 goals. 

Chnstian Brothers advanced to 

the semifinal match with a first-
round bye followed by a second-
round win over Barry University 
3- 1, and an overwhelming 7- 1 win 
over North Florida in the quarter-
finals last weekend . Gareth 
O'Sullivan led the Lady 
Buccaneers to an i,lcrcdible sea-
son tlus year, culminating regular 
season play by winning the Gulf 
South Conference championship. 

GSC Player of the Year, junior 
forward Missy Gregg, notched an 
NCAA-record 72 goals on the 
season, breaking that of the previ-
ous I ecord of 45 goals in a single 
season . Besidcs having 16 hat 
tricks, Gregg has scored at least

and we are the team 
to beat:

UCSD soccer player 

onc goal in every gamc this year 
and has already tied the NCAA 
tournament record with six goals. 

Fellow junior forward 
Margaret Saurin, who recorded 23 
goals and 29 assists on the season, 
will also be a scoring threat in the 
Buccaneers' quest for the national 
title. Junior goalie Jennifer Simon 
and freshman defender Veronica 
Botold direct the fierce Buccaneer 
defense, which has onl y allowed 
11 goals this season. 

Christian Brothers University 
has championship potential and 
the Buccaneer team is determined 
to bring its "A" game in order to 
overtake its competitors. 

The undefeated, first-ranked 
Franklin Pierce Ravens hope to 
add a national title to their season. 
The Ravens are the most donu-
nant team in Division Il women's 
soccer history with five national

championship titles, .incl uding 
four consecutive championships 
from 1994 to 1997. T he 2001 
Ravens squad capt'ured thc 
Northeast 10 Conference titlc at 
tile conclusion of regular season 
play and then continued to beat 
both Merrimack 2-1 and Lock 
Ilaven 1-0 in overtimc. The 22-0 
Ravens make their lOth straight 
tournament and semifinal appear-
ance this year. 

Since taking the helm at 
Franklin Pierce College in 1996, 
head coach J eff B"lley continues a 
long tradition of success and has 
since compiled a 120-6-2 record. 

The Ravens offense is led by 
junior forwards Patricia Keeldar 
(30 goa ls, 10 assists), April Mann 
(17 goals, 13 a sists), and Angela 
Verdoes (16 goals, 15 assists) . 
This explosive offensive trio has 
outscored its opponents 100-17. 
Senior goalkeeper Kim Higgins 
(26 saves) anchors the steady 
Raven defense and has rccorded 
11 shutouts this yea r. 

The final four teams combined 
have an overall 84-3 record and 
UCSD head coach McManus 
knows that the competition this 
year is intense. 

"Christian Brothers is the 
favorite to win it all," McManus 
said. "Franklin Pierce is picked to 
finish second, and then it is a toss-
up between Northern Kentucl.:y 
and us. Bur, we are going to play 
the upcoming matches just like 
we've played every other game 
and will hope that it is good 
enough for us to come out on 
top." 

The Tritons look forward to 
superb competition and a high 
level of play in the NCAA 
Division lJ Championship. 

"Like our coach says," Wensel 
said, "we are the champions so we 
are the team to beat. As long as we 
play our game, no tcam in 
Division II can beat us." 

Stoner: 
More great things to 
come from UCSD sports 
Continued from page 24 
because our team is in that elite 
class.

ing an incredible wave ot momen-

onships after winning the region-
also J t has ordy improved over the 
course of the season and stands in 
good position to hand head coach 
Duncan McFarland his first 
Divi sion II women's volleyball 
championship. 

The men's cross country team, 
after placing third in the California 
Collegiate Athletic As ociation 
championship meet, advanced 
through regionals and traveled to 
Pennsylvania for the CAA men's 
cross country championships. The 
team competed against the top 
programs in the nation and placed 
15 tho Its excellent season scored 
UCSD major points in the Sears 
Directors' Cup race and estab-
lished UCSD as a signifieant play-
er in Division n cro s country. 

The men's water polo team, 
while it did not equal last year's 
incredible run to the title game 
again t UCLA, still had an impres-
sive year, fini shing with a 20-7 
record. The team sta rted its season 
with a perfect 10-0 record until it 
lost to Pepperdine. It made it all 
the way to the final s of the Western 
Water Polo Association 
Championship in Los Angeles, 
before ending the season with a 
loss to Loyola Marymount 
University. 

Not ordy have our sports teams 
been excellent this fall, but the 
UCSD fans supporting them have 
also been a pleasant surprise . 
UCSD has drawn sizable crowds to 

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 2001 

soccer, volleyball and water polo 
games this year. The Triton Tade, 
an Associa ted Students spirit 
group, has been present at all the 
major sporting events throwing T-
shirts at the crowds with the arne 
reckless abandon they use to throw 
insults at the officials. 

And it's not over yet, not by far. 
The swimming and diving tcam 
already I,as several meets under its 
belt, h i.~ placed second at the 
Triton Invi tational and will bc 
competing in the Speedo Cup this 
weekend. Crew have been waking 
up early every day to pracrice and 
have already competed in severa l 
cvents to get ready for their season. 
The UCSD men's and women's 
fencing teams have been destroy-
ing their opponents as they head 
into a long break. Their next 
matches are in February 2002. 

There arc more hints of 
promising seasons to come: The 
women's basketball team upset 
crosstown Division [ rival San 
Diego State in its season opener at 
SDSU. Led by senior point guard 
Maya Fok and junior guard 

icholle Bromley, the team is 
looking to make some noise in the 
CCAA this year after finishing I I -
I I last yea r. 

The men's basketball team, 
after a horrible 3-19 league record 
last year, is looking much better 
this year. After netting an impres-
sive come-from-behind victory in a 
preseason game against a touring 
junior Australian national team, it 
destroyed Division In University 
of Redlands 104-44 before losing 
to two Division I schools : 
University of San Diego and 
SDSU. But even Aztec coach Steve 
Fisher said that the Tritons have 
significantly improved since last 
year. 

If none of this gets anyone 
interested or excited about UCSD 
sports, then I don't know what 
will.

Fencing dominates its opponents 
Triton fencing looks to become a national powerhouse 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

UCSD's men's and women's 
fencing teams are quietly having 
one of their best seasons ever. 
While women's soccer, women's 
volleyball, men's water 1)010 and 
men's cro s country hog the 
UCSD limelight with their runs at 
national glory, the fencing squads' 
successes have been invis.ible to 
the UCSD public. 

"We've basically won every-
thing this year," Lee said. 

UCSD boasts the top fencers in 
five of the six fencing categories. 

In women's foil, which involves 
a thrusting weapon, senior Jessica 
Fripp leads the way for the Tritons. 
PrOlnising sophomore Christine 
Megowan heads the women's epee 
quad, whicll also uses a thrusting 

weapon. [n women's sabre, which 
uses a slashing weapon, sophomorc 
Katie Stapko ranks at the top. 

men's squad has Icd the conferencc 
for the past two years. The women s 
squad placed first two years ago 
while placing second last year. Both 
quads look poised for conference 

championships again this year. 

SPORT 23 

Head coach Stuart Lee is excit-
ed about his team's performance 
this year. 
. "This is a pinnacle year for us," 

Lee said. "This is one of the best 
squads that I've had in the five years 
that I've been coaching here." 

On the men's side, senior team 
captain Andrew Anfora places 
atop the foil competition while 
senior Justin Hunt heads the 
men 's epee division. As a team, the 
men's abre squad is ranked sec-
ond in the division but does not 
house the top individual fencer. 

The real test for the lritons will 
come at their first post-break com-
petition, which won 't be until Feb. 
2. That will be a large dual meet 
held at the Air Force Academy in 
Colorado, which will feawre top-
ranked teams like Stanford, otre 
Dame, Duke, Northwestern, 
Florida and Air Force. Lee hopes 
his tcam will make a statement at 
that competition. 

Dave Ries/GuordlOn 

Committed fans: These UCSD faithful showed up at San DIego State to root the 
Tritons on. Unfortunately for these enthusiasts, theIr team lost the game. 

The Tritons are off to an amaz-
ing start this year. Both the 
women's and men's teams are 
undefeated, each posting perfect 
7 -0 records. Anlong the victories 
was one agai nst fourth-ranked 
Stanford University at a dual meet 
Nov. 10. 

" I've never as a coach had five 
people in individual first place 
before," Lee said. "This is truly 
amazing." 

The Tritons compete in tile 
Intercollegiate Fencing Conference 
of Southern CaliforIua. UCSO'so 

"For me, that competition is 
about playing with tile big boys," 
Lee said. "[ think that we are 
ready." 

Lee has a lot of big plans for 
his team. 

"My goal is to make us into a 
national powerhouse," Lee said·. " I 
think that the school has an inter-
est in it and [ only see tllings gct-
ting better for liS."

The Tritons had three players

Guard Ali Ginn and center 
Margaret Johnson scored 10 and 
12 points, respectively, for the 
Tritons. Ginn also grabbed eight 
rebounds, while Johnson finished 
with nine boards and four steals. 

The game began slowly, with 
both teams shooting poorly from 
the floor. The first half ended with 
the Tritons leading 27-25. 

In the second half, UCSD 

played with more energy and 
gained control of the game. The 
Tritons outscored Redlands 43 -28 
in the second half. 

UCSD cleaned lip off the 
backboards and outrebounded 
Bulldogs 46 to 36.

UCSD to host Division II Final Four 
Triton soccer stadium home to 2001 women's soccer championships 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

And then there were four. 
UCSD, Northern Kentucky 

University, Franklin Pierce 
College, and Christian Brothers 
University women's soccer teams 
surpassed the other competition 
and will gather at Triton Soccer 
Stadium to compete in the 2001 
NCAA Division II Women's Soccer 
Championship. 

Semifinal action begins Nov. 30 
at 5 p.m. with the Franklin Pierce 
Ravens squaring off against the 
Christian Brothers Lady 
Buccaneers. That action will be fol -
lowed by the 7:30 p.m. game 
between the UCSD Tritons and 
the Northern Kentucky orse. 
The winners will advance to the 
championship game Dec. 2 at 1 
p.m. 

Hosting the division champi-
onship is the latest achievement of 
the many great feats of the UCSD 
women's soccer team. From 1989 
to 1999, head coach Brian 
McManus led the Division III 
Tritons to five national titles. In his 
15 yea rs as UCSD's head coach, 
McManus boasts a 256-29- 18 
record. 

Last year, UCSD moved up to 
Division 11 and became the first 
NCAA team, in any sport, to win 
back-to-back championships while 
movi ng lip in divisiona l sta tus. 

While many team members 
think that competing in the 200 I 
NCAA Division 11 Championship 
at home is an advantage to the 
Tritons, McManus lacks enthusi-
asm about the location of the tour-
nament. 

"Playing at home is good in 
some ways, but I feel that there is 
added pressure on the team simply 
because we are hosting the tourna-
mcnt," McManus said. "We nor-
mally do very well in Final Four 
competitions when we travel 
because all of the girls' attention is 
on soccer. Here, there are many 
unnecessary distractions that 
wouldn 't be issues if we traveled to 
play." 

Freshman midfielder Christine 
Kwon and sophomore defender 
Christine Wensel think that having 
home field advantage will only aid 
the Tri ton squad. 

"It takes a lot out of players to 
travel, so being able to play on our 
own field that we are familiar with 
is a great physical advantage," 
Kwon sa id. "The support that we 
get and the energy of the crowd 
really bring in the pressure and 
exci tement. Our team performs 
well when we are in the spotlight -
we play to win." 

Wensel agreed. 
"\lVe get the support of our fam-

ily and friends," Wensel said. "Also, 
having hundreds of fans behind us 
cheering us on really helps the 

team's intensity and we pick up 
[ourJlevel of play." 

The fifth-ranked Tritons enter 
the Final Four with a regular sea-
son record of 19-2 and have not 
lost a posts~ason game since 1998. 
UCSD secured the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association title 
earlier this year before advancing to 
the playoffs. In the 2001 CAA 
tournament so far, all opponents 
are careless against UCSD. The 
Tritons beat Cal Poly Pomona 1-0 
and overpowered Incarnate Word 
2-0 to earn a berth to the CAA 
Semifinal match . -

Senior defender Julia Cuder, the 
CCAA Most Valuable Player for 
2001, and sophomore goal ie Kami 
Poma, who recorded 80 saves this 
season, led the Triton defense. The 
Tritons have only allowed eight 
goals in 21 g,lmes and have not 
allowed mure than one goal in any 
game this season. 

Senior forward Erika Alfredson 
(15 goals, 7 assists), sophomore for-
ward Kristin J one (8 goals, 7 
assists) and sophomore mid fielder 
Megan Mendoza (8 goals, 5 assists) 
drive the UCSD offensive attack. 
Despite their apparent dominance, 
the Tritons are keenly aware of 
their competition. 

"We are confident in our abili ty 
as a team, but we know we are still 
defending our title," Kwon said.

Basketball -falls to San Diego State stoner 
steps 

M en's team overpowered by Division I crosstown rival 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team went into its game Tuesday 
night trying to repeat what the 
women did less than a week 
hefore: upset Division I San Diego 
State University at Cox Arena. 

The Aztecs pounded the 
Tritons 98-53 . 

The Division II Tritons jumped 
out to a 13-10 lead four minutes 
into the first half and gave their 
fa ns hope. Tony Bland, a transfer 
from Syracuse University who led 
the Orangemen to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
tournament during the 1998-1999 
and 1999-2 000 seasons, then made 
two consecutive field goals to give 
SDSU a 14-13 lead. 

After gaining the; lead, the 
Aztecs went on a 16-4 run over the 
next 10 ,ninutes and put UCSD 
out of striking distance. SDSU's 
defense forced nine turnovers and 
the team made nine of 12 shots 
during the run. 

The Aztecs managed to gain 
nine more points during the rest 
o f the half to go into the locker 
room with a 57-39 advantage. At 
the midpoint of the game, the 
Aztecs were 24-for-32 from the 
field and had a 15-8 rebound 
advantage. 

"We went into the locker room 
[at halftime] feeling good about 
our play," said SDSU head coach 

teve Fisher. "We knew we had to 
keep up the pressure." 

UPCOMING EVENTS 

They kept up the pressure. It 
was more of tHe same coming out 
of the half as the Aztecs headed 
toward the victory, falling just two 
points short of triple digits. 

Though the score indicates 
otherwise, the Tritons played 
much better than they did last 
week against the University of San 
Diego - a game UCSD lost 89-
62 . 

"I thought we handled the 
press," said Triton head coach 
Greg Lanthier of the Aztecs' suf-
focating defense. 

The Tritons had 26 turnovers, 
six more than they had against 
USD, but most of those did not 
come as a direct result of the 
press. 

The Tritons remained on the 
perimeter most of the night 
against the bigger Aztecs. Of 
their final 53 field goal attempts, 
33 were from beyond the three-
point arc. SDSU stifled UCSD's 
slashing offense by clogging pass-
ing lanes and forcing outside 
shots. 

"Their pressure defense forced 
us to play much quicker than we 
wanted," Lanthier said. "We 
weren 't really able to set up our 
half-court offense." 

Jody Woods led the Tritons 
with 13 points and four rebounds 
while adding a physical presence 
against the taller and stronger 
SDSU front line. 

Bland ended the night with 20 
points - his fifth consecu tive 
game scoring 20 or more - and

eight assists in only 22 minutes of 
action. The Aztecs went 40-for-59 
from the field while making 78 
percent of their free throws. 

Point guard Cameron Jackson 
was out of the Triton lineup for the 
second straight game. He broke his 
finger at practice last week. 

"He has a week or two before 
he can play again," Lanthier said. 
"We're hoping to have him back 
before we start playing conference 
games."

Since this is the last issue of the 
quarter, this seems 
like a good time to 
review the fall sport-
ing season and take 
a look at what's 
ahead. 

After sending men 's water polo, 
women 's soccer, men's cross coun-
try and women's volleyball into 
pomeason play, anyone who isn 't 
excited about UCSD sports should 
have their head examined. With 
both the women's soccer team and 
the women's volleyball team still 
playing, we have a legi timate 
chance to house two national 
championship teams afte r only one 
quarter. 

UCSD's Triton Soccer Stadium 
was selected as the site of the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Women's Soccer Final 
Four for the t'irst time in ages. That 
our school was picked to host a 
championship game is a testament 
to the quality of our facilities and, 
more importantly, our athletes and 
their supporters. UCSD students 
and La Jolla are being offered the 
chance to see the top four teams in 
the nation play, which is exciting 
enough by itself but is all the better
