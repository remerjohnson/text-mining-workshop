Committee
Considers
GreekÊ
HousingÊÊÊ
By Kirsten Mauro
Contributing Writer

Last night, A.S. Council 
approved a special committee dedi-
cated to investigating the possibility 
of on-campus Greek Housing.

Campuswide Senator Michael 
Raimondi is the chair of the the 
special committee, called the Greek 
Housing Initiative. Raimondi said 
the idea first came from his strug-
gle to find an affordable housing 
unit for himself and his Tau Kappa 
Epsilon brothers.

The committee also consists of 
16 councilmebmers and three repre-
sentatives from the Inter-Fraternity 
Council, Panhellenic Association 
and Multicultural Greek Council. 

Raimondi said that, ideally, the 
committee would build Greek hous-
ing similar to UC Santa Barbara’s 
Isla Visla, or UC Irvine’s Arroyo 
Vista residences. 

The committee plans to hold 
public meetings on a weekly or 
bimonthly basis to receive input 
from UCSD organization members 
and interested students. Raimondi 
has already presented his ideas to 
both UCSD Executive Director of 
Housing and Dining Services Mark 
Cunningham and Vice Chancellor  
of Student Life Penny Rue. 

“If we’re going to build a Greek 
Row. we need to do it right,” he said. 
“This is the first time it has been 
presented in a professional manner.” 

Although the funding and poten-
tial building site have not  yet been 
discussed, Raimondi said there are 
a few different possibilities. Money 
for the housing’s construction could 
either come from Greek chapters’ 
member dues, or the university 
could sell its land, specifically for 
this purpose, to a private construc-
tion company that would in turn 
lease to the students.  

The only available open land 
near campus that can accommo-
date a housing infrastructure is La 
Jolla Shores. Raimondi said that this 
is an option, since the widespread 
idea that La Jolla prohibits eight or 
more unrelated individuals living 
together is untrue. 

“The rules about housing have 
always been a myth that we assume 
to be true, but it isn’t necessarily,” 
he said. 

Muir Senator Ryan O’Rear said 
the housing initiative would not be 
exclusive to UCSD’s Greek popula-
tion. 

“The on-campus housing would 
be for any large group of affili-
ated students — sports teams, Greek 
organization — who would like to 
live together on campus,” he said.

BIG BOI

MUTEMATH

N.A.S.A.

S ometime this July, acclaimed Atlanta rapper Big Boi emerged from a cloud of blunt smoke to release what 
will undoubtedly be one of the best rap 
albums of the year. The album, entitled 
Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico 
Dusty, and its success should come as no 
surprise to anyone familiar with Big Boi’s 
work as half of the beloved hip hop duo 
OutKast (“B.O.B.,” “So Fresh, So Clean,” 
“Ms. Jackson”).

Big Boi’s career as a solo artist can be 
traced back to the 2003 OutKast double 
album, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below — 
which essentially boiled down to a solo 
album from each OutKast member. Big 
Boi’s half of the record contained the 
Billboard number-one hit “The Way You 
Move,” as well as excellent tracks like 
“Ghetto Musick” and “Bowtie.” After their 
ill-fated venture into musical film with 
2006’s Idlewild, the members of OutKast 
decided to each release one solo album 
before continuing their efforts as a duo. 
In the four years between this split and 
the release of Sir Lucious Left Foot, Big

D espite the name of their first hit “Typical,” Mutemath isn’t your aver-

continue to revel in the heavy screamo 
sound of the early ‘00s (we’re lookin’ at

N .A.S.A. stands for North America/South America, an acronym meant to 
represent the duo’s collaborative effort to 
bridge funk, reggae, electro-rap and soul 
with traditional Brazilian rhythms, under-

After A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine miscalculated almost $350,000 in the revision of the executive budget, A.S. 
Council decided last night to postpone the 
approval of the budget until next week.

 The discrepancy was due in part to confusion 
over which administrative services the council 
needed to fund, as well as errors in predicting 
sources of revenue.

“There was miscom-
munication over some 
of the line items,” Ben 
Hassine said. “It was pri-
marily a miscalculation 
between me, the VP of 
Student Life and VP of 
Finances regarding the 
effective employee ben-
efit rate. The figures 
didn’t add up.”

The effective 
employee benefit rate 
— or the money that 
council pays for its non-

student staff — is to $145,016.43. In the first of 
two revisions, this number was not included in 
the total allocation of $2,487,648.04. Council sti-
pends totaling $116,752.87 also were not included 
to the total allocations.

According to Warren College Senator Maclen 
Zilber — who brought the miscalculations to 
Ben Hassine’s attention Tuesday night after the 
first budget draft was presented on Oct. 9 — Ben 
Hassine was not aware the council funded non-
student staff members. She believed the univer-
sity subsidizes these benefits and thus did not 
include this money in her total allocations.

“I alerted the president, Wafa Ben Hassine, 
about [the mistakes],” Zilber 
said. “She did not seem to 
understand the arithmetic error 
that I was pointing out to her, 
which was that stipends and staff 
benefits were not included in her 
budget, until [Tuesday] night.”

Zilber then consulted with 
Student Life Business Officer 

John Hughes, Student Life HR Specialist Masooda 
Sajady, Director of A.S. Admin. Lauren Weiner 
and Executive Assistant Heather Belk, who all 
confirmed that Associated Students as respon-
sible for this cost.  

Though there is a typical overallocation of 
$150,000 to ensure that student fees are being 
used for the current year and not carried over, 
the exclusion of stipends and employee benefit

Inter-Fraternity Council repre-
sentative Shawn Xu said he hopes to 
see this new idea be pursued.

The whole purpose of this com-
mittee is just to introduce research 
into something thats never really 
been done before, he said. We 
really want to look into it.

Raimondi said the next step will 
be receiving student feedback.

I simply have not had the student 
input I need yet, he said. Personally, 
I have a vision and an outline, but 
until I can get collaborative ideas 
from the Greek Community and any 
student who is in support, I cannot 
create a proposal. 

Raimondi plans for the com-
mittee to have a concrete proposal 
outlined by Winter Quarter.

costs totaled the overallocation at 
$464,374.76 for the first draft.  

After Ben Hassine and Vice 
President of Finance and Resources 
Andrew Ang became aware of this 
problem, they created a revised bud-
get that evening that contained fur-
ther errors. This newly revised ver-
sion of the budget  which factored 
in the stipends but not the employee 
benefit rate  was sent to the council 
five hours before the groups weekly 6 
p.m. meeting.

The second revision included a 
stipend of $117,383.33, increased 
estimated enrollment and Short-
Term Investment Pool money but 
not the effective employee benefit 
rate. This draft had an overallocation 
of $349,389.97.

Though the original draft calcu-
lated the councils revenue based on a 
correct enrollment number of 21,850, 
Ben Hassine changed the enrollment 
number to 22,100 in reference to 
last years estimated enrollment. This 
change added $30,031.64 to the bud-
get. In addition, she changed the esti-
mated revenue for STIP to $80,000 

in the latest revision, whereas the 
correct number was $28,000. This  
$52,000 revenue would have come 
from the councils mandate reserves. 

Ben Hassine then consulted 
with Hughes, who confirmed that 
the 21,850 number was correct. The 
original enrollment statistic will be 
used in the newest budget, which 
will be included in the draft for next 
weeks meeting.

When she corrected for stipends 
[on Tuesday] night, she still didnt 
correct for benefits and she couldnt 
come up with the money to coun-
teract it, so she kind of magicked 
$80,000 out of the ether, Zilber said. 
She said that our short-term invest-
ment pool was now going to yield 
$80,000 instead of $28,000. And she 
said our estimated enrollment had 
gone up.

The other change that will be 
incorporated into next weeks draft 
is the All Campus Graduation 
Celebration line item, which will not 
be included under the Office of the 
Presidents budget. According to Ben 
Hassine, the Student Life office said 
they do not need funds from A.S. 

Council anymore.
Sixth College Senator Parminder 

Sandhu said the miscalculations 
show mismanagement in the Office 
of the President.

I feel sad for the condition of the 
Office of the President, Sandhu said. 
This is the person who represents 
21,000 undergraduates, not respect-
ing the Associated Students, not ful-
filling duties to the level that should 
be expected.

Other disagreements regard-
ing the budget arose between Ben 
Hassine and Ang. Last week, Ang 
removed his name from the spon-
sorship of the budget due to dis-
agreements over the allocations of 
three line items: the diversity training 
initiative, the Black Student Unions 
Kwanzaa celebration and the gen-
eral initiatives under the Office of 
the President.

According to Ang, the newly 
added diversity training initiative 
should not require funding, since 
an online training program already 
exists that can be used in place of the

initiative.
“There’s no precedence to back 

that up,” Ang said. “I looked up the 
breakdown of what it would be used 
for. It doesn’t cost $2,000. I spoke 
with the VP of Student Life [Kristina 
Pham], who oversees the Office of 
Diversity, and we came to terms that 
we can use diversity programming 
for it and take out diversity training 
and initiatives.”

Ang said his decision to remove 
his endorsement from 
the budget was par-
tially based on Ben 
Hassine’s refusal to 
remove the line item.

“I spoke to the 
overseeing parties, yet 
the president insisted 
that we needed to have 
it,” Ang said. “I didn’t 
see any logistical rea-
soning why we had to 
have it   — we had a 
perfectly fine line item 
to use it from. It would 
be fiscally irresponsible 
to add in the line item 
just to have it there.”

Ang added that 
the general initiative 
line item — a $5,000 
amount that is allocat-
ed for the entire coun-
cil — should not be 
under the Office of the 
President.

“I am not in favor 
of the general initiative because it 
counts as a discretionary line item for 
[Ben Hassine],” Ang said. “Basically, 
she can use the funds for however she 
wishes. There would be no oversee-
ing factor and she gets $5,000 in her 
office. And I am 100 percent against 
miscellaneous nontransparent use of 
funds.”

But in the second draft of the 
fall budget, Ben Hassine changed 
the title of a $5,000 line item under 

the Office of the President called 
“General Initiatives” to “Community 
Development,” and directed the 
money toward funding a press sec-
retary, student advocacy campaigns 
and a bottle water campaign.

 Another point of contention was 
over the annual Kwanzaa celebration, 
which is a tradition event organized 
by the BSU.

“We disagreed on whether we 
should be funding BSU’s Kwanzaa, 
which is a tradition event that has 

been around for 
over a decade,” 
Ben Hassine said. 
“[Losing] it would 
be very detrimental 
to student life.”

Ang said he 
did not want to 
allocate funds to 
the event because 
the BSU did not 
reply to his e-mail 
inquiries regarding 
funding and there-
fore did not follow 
proper protocol. 
Councilmembers 
cited communica-
tion discrepancies 
and organization 
transition problems 
as the reasons for 
the lack of response.

“[Them not 
replying to e-mails] 
showed that they 
didn’t care enough 

to get money,” Ang said. It’s my 
responsibility to help the organiza-
tion out, but if I can’t get a recipro-
cated action from them for them to 
do their part, there’s nothing else I 
can really do.”

Ang said that, despite the BSU 
neglecting funding protocol, the 
president decided to include the tra-
ditional event in the budget.

“I really don’t see the reason why 
she put it back in because, when you 

do a budget, you should be objective 
in the way you allocate everything 
because you can’t favor one office 
over another,” Ang said. “I was unbi-
ased in my procedure to allocate 
funds and to get the tradition events. 
By putting it in, she neglected all the 
protocols used.” 

Ang said that he and Ben 
Hassine — who, under the 
ASUCSD Constitution, is in charge 
of formulating and submitting the 
annual budget to the council — had 
not worked on the budget since last 
Spring Quarter. Though the VP 
Finance usually only assists with 
the budget, he said that he offered 
to help her with allocations because 
Ben Hassine had been preoccupied 
with her LSATs.

“Last week, I contacted the pres-
ident [and asked] ‘Do you need 
help doing the budget?’ And then 
she had to study for LSATs — that’s 
a test of a lifetime you have to take,” 
he said. “The budget was com-
ing up and she had her LSATs last 
Saturday and, of course, I would 
help her out regardless, but at the 
same time, it’s also the president’s 
responsibility to do the budget.”

At the council meeting, the 
BSU Vice Chair of External Affairs 
Victor Brown argued that removing 
the funding would be a blow to the 
organization.

“To see it lose its funding and 
to see it lose its tradition is dis-
heartening because it loses the leg-
acy to the past and current Black 
Student Union,” Brown said.

Ang said that they would not be 
able to receive funding for the tradi-
tion event in the executive budget 
because it did not follow funding 
guidelines. Instead, the organiza-
tion will have the chance to either 
request funding through program-
ming or wait until next year.

Budget week is upon us.  With excited tones and snacks all around, council began its 
meeting.   And with tired eyes and 
an exhausted mind, I began my foray 
into what was expected to be one of 
council’s legendary six-hour meet-
ings.

As council anticipated the budget’s 
unveiling, public input commenced 
with Aaron Speer, CALPIRG chair, 
who highlighted 
some events that 
CALPIRG is work-
ing.

Warren College 
Student Council 
President Alyssa 
Wing  gave a pre-
sentation regarding the past and pres-
ent inconsistencies of A.S. Council’s 
funding of college councils.  

She said her research of previous 
budgets indicates that the council is 
violating its own constitution by not 
following a 1985 referendum that 
called for a piece of the student activ-
ity fees to go to college council fund-
ing.  She called for a committee to be 
charged with investigating this matter 
and restore council with a consistent 
approach with funding college coun-
cils.

Vice Chair of External Affairs for 
the Black Student Union Victor Brown 
stopped by council to address the issue 
of tradition funding.   Brown insisted 
that the BSU will take a hit if this 
funding is taken away due to the org 
missing deadlines for funding proto-
col. Council members were divided on 
the issue of whether Kwanzaa fund-
ing should be added as a line item to 
the executive budget. Several council 
members, including, AVP Academic 
Affairs Desiree Prevo said that when 
funding deadline e-mails were sent out 
in April of Spring Quarter, the BSU had 
been preoccupied.  

Transfer Senator Adam Powers 
reminded council that the VP Finance 
is aligned with diversity issues, and his 
funding of a tradition event is neces-
sary to keep A.S. Council accountable 
and consistent.   Matthew Vu, AVP 
Local Affairs, emphasized that the 
Black Student Union’s actions last year 
should be taken into consideration 
when debating tradition funding.  

As the agenda approached com-
mittee updates, I 
gradually prepared 
myself for the 
approaching bud-
get discussion.   It 
began with a move 
to table until next 
week’s meeting 

from Powers.  
As the call for objections came 

regarding the motion to table the 2010-
11 Executive Budget, I  braced myself 
for the uproar.  Powers’ objection was 
based on the mistakes that were in the 
budget regarding various line items, 
and the need for more time to sort 
out the problems.   After a discussion 
and a 30-minute moderated caucus, 
the motion to table the approval of the 
budget until next week’s meeting was 
passed.  And just like that, it ended. 

Sixth College Senator Parminder 
Sandhu commented on the graffiti 
that popped around campus prior to 
the rallies of Oct. 7 rallies.  According 
to Sandhu, that graffiti will have to be 
cleaned up by university workers, and 
will create more problems than the 
good it might have been intended for.  

For three weeks in a row, A.S. meet-
ings have ended before 9 p.m. After 
spending my Wednesday preparing 
myself for a lengthy and heated meet-
ing, I returned to my room slightly 
disappointed. Now I have to repeat 
the process all over again for next 
week.  So until then, keep on a’ rollin’ 
UCSD.

My life is defined by politics. I study politics, I talk poli-tics and I want to work in 
politics. Unfortunately for me, this 
love only goes one way; Washington 
D.C. is a hotbed of the elite and my 
last name isn’t Kennedy. Tack on the 
fact that my alma mater is UCSD — a 
great school, sure, but it’s no Harvard 
or Yale — and the unlikely becomes 
the impossible.  

Then a ray of hope came in the 
form of radical conservatives, decked 
out in their best George Washington 
outfits and waving their freak flags 
for all of national television to see. 

I never cared much for the rhym-
ing chants of the Tea Party move-
ment, but after its members started 
snagging key state and federal jobs, 
the politico in me started to pay 
attention. They’ve also managed to 
help Sarah Palin indefinitely extend 
her 15 minutes of fame, and throw 
forgotten stars Kelsey Grammer and 
Jon Voight back into the spotlight. 

Maybe, just maybe, the Tea Party 
express could be my ticket to D.C.

So I buckled down, suppressed my 
liberal tendencies and started playing 
Tea Party speeches, hoping to master 
the rhetoric for my time in the right-
wing spotlight. After a few painful 
hours, however, all I could recite were 
the same phrases about “Freedom-
loving Americans,” “taking back the 
country,” “elitist big government,” and 
of course, “deficit spending.” As much 
as I tried to color my little blue liberal 
heart red, I knew deep down that me 
supporting these slogans wouldn’t be 
enough to sway anybody. 

The Tea Partiers are just attention 
seekers; this fact shows through in 
almost every rally they hold. There is 
no united policy or agreement among 
their members, except that the gov-
ernment is doing wrong. 

How the government is wrong 
varies from rally to rally.  To some, 
the government is elitist because 
they’re socialists with an agenda 
bleeding the rich dry; to others, the 
government’s elitist because they’re 
bailing out Wall Street. 

The Tea Partiers’ drumming and 
chanting may convince some, but 
hopefully the “average Americans” see 
the Tea Baggers refer to aren’t delu-
sional enough to think that everyone 
with a political opinion is equally 
qualified to take on important gov-
ernment jobs. 

If I were having brain surgery, my 
doctors better be from an amazing 
medical school. Along those same 
lines — the ones that let us semi-
confidently put our lives in the hands 
of complete strangers — my represen-
tatives in the American government 
should have solid training in how to 
run a country. 

When I look at my less-than-
stellar GPA and think back to all the 
late nights I spent struggling through 
my Math 10A homework, I know I 
am nowhere near qualified for a top 
government position. Yet.

In spite of this, I am not at all dis-
heartened. Thanks to my ECON101 
course, I believe in a little thing called 
comparative advantage; some people 
are better at running a country, while 
others were meant to flip burgers.

Wednesday of Week Three is upon us — that magical time when the A.S. Council should be 
in the dying throes of a marathon meeting, 

bickering among themselves over how, 
exactly, to parcel out their colossal $2.9 

million endowment.
Instead of your run-of-the-mill eight-hour 

meeting, however, we have $349,000 unaccounted for 
and an A.S. President who doesn’t appear to understand how 

the budget works. As if to add insult to injury, it looks like most 
of our student representatives still don’t know what’s going on. 

Pay attention, council. This is the first big decision you’ve had 
to make so far, and the way this mess is turning out — mishandling 
of massive amounts of funds, presidential snafus, dissent in the 
ranks and general obliviousness — does not bode well for the coming 
months. 

And our president’s attempts to magically transform the budget into 
some kind of coherency have not been going well.

This year, much like every year, A.S. Council started off with a budget 
of $2.9 million in student fees that they have the power to allocate. This 
year, exactly like every year, it is a key responsibility of the A.S. President 
— our very own Wafa Ben Hassine — to produce a solid budget that 
the council will bicker over for days before passing. It’s a time-honored 
tradition.

The first budget Ben Hassine put together left out about $145,000 
in predicted expenses — a sum meant to fund the salaries and benefits 
of the administrative staff that oversees the Council — in addition to 
$117,000 worth of council stipends. 

It is a sign of a bigger problem than simple mismanagement when 
the purported leader of 21,000 undergraduates can’t figure out where the 
money is going. But forgetting to carry the one and double check just 
how many zeroes are supposed to be to the left of the decimal point is 
still an honest, if huge, mistake. It’s her method of recovery that’s got us

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
While UC students statewide 

were protesting about student fee 
hikes, the 9-year anniversary of the 
Afghan war came and passed unno-
ticed throughout our campus. One 
campus club, the Young Americans 
for Liberty, did not forget such an 
infamous event, hence the antiwar 
slogans chalked around campus on 
Oct. 7, 2010. As a non-interven-
tionist club, UCSD YAL believes 
it’s time to bring the troops home. 
Nine years, 34,000 civilian deaths, 
2,400 coalition military deaths and 
$354 billion have not made our 
nation any safer than it was before 
9/11.

Since the beginning of this “war,” 
our individual liberties have been 
drastically reduced for the sake of 
national security. James Madison 
once said, “No nation could pre-
serve its freedom in the midst of 
continual warfare.” Our government 
has forced through legislation that 
allows unwarranted spying on its 
citizens as well as the ability for the 
U.S. military to secretly torture and 
assassinate individuals around the 
world.

So while you might walk out of 
your classes and march for “free” 
education, someone’s son, daugh-
ter, mother, or father is dying over-
seas and we, the American taxpay-
ers, must foot the bill. How many 
more dollars, bullets and bodies 
must we throw into Afghanistan 
before we achieve any sort of vic-
tory? Instead of protesting a lack 
of funding for state education, we 
should all be protesting a federal 
government spending our money 
to deprive us of our life, liberty and 
property.

Dear Editor, 
Let’s not beat around the bush, 

because I only can fit about 200 words 
here. If we were in a scene from 
“Mean Girls” where Lindsay Lohan is 
describing the social groups and she 
was at UCSD, she’d say, “There’s the 
Asian geeks that don’t talk to anyone 
and study all day long in order to not 
get beat by their parents,” and “There’s 
the Greek life, where the frat guys 
are all douche bags and all the girls 
are skanks.” The truth is, it’s not as 
simple as geeks vs. Greeks. There’s a 
lot of grey area where there are nor-
mal, fun-loving yet studious kids that 
attend this school. So what do you do 
if you’re not part of the church com-
munity, part of Greek life or part of 
the bio majors? It’s quite simple. Get a 
good foundation of friends with you 
that share the same interests. For me, 
it’s study during the week and play 
during the weekends. Next, be social, 
goddamn it. You see a cute girl/guy? 
Go talk to her. Get some cajones, 
man. Go out to the bars, or if you’re 
not of age, go to parties. If that’s not 
your scene, throw some events at your 
place. Chances are that there are peo-
ple wanting to do something but don’t 
have an outlet, just like you. Slowly 
but surely, you’ll become a social but-
terfly. But remember, it’s all about the 
cajones.

scratching our heads.
Ben Hassine was alerted to this 

discrepancy Tuesday night and was 
quick to respond with her next bud-
get, releasing a new budget draft a 
mere five hours before the meet-
ing. It had some interesting new 
numbers — namely 250 additional 
students pulled from thin air that 
contributed a purely hypothetical 
$31,000 to the A.S. moneybags. The 
council’s estimated investment rev-
enue was also increased by an arbi-
trary $52,000, with no explanation 
for where that money was meant to 
come from. 

The whole thing was presented, 
glanced at and tabled. Whether the 
confusion was a product of the 250 
imaginary undergraduates or the 

suddenly nonexistent staff benefits, 
tabling was the wise — and probably 
the only — choice. Sorting out this 
clusterfuck is going to take longer 
than even the most tiring council 
meeting. 

And while this is by no means the 
first budget to be tabled, it may just 
be the first that’s been tabled without 
discussion.

There are some redeemers in this 
fiscal dramedy, namely a couple key 
councilmembers who knew enough 
to be puzzled over chunks of the bud-
get suddenly vanishing. For the most 
part, however, we’re just left staring at 
our new president in disbelief.

Numbers — especially ones repre-
senting large sums of money — don’t 
just come out of nowhere, and the 
fact that they’re being conjured into 

existence so early on something so 
crucial is not a good sign. 

Furthermore, Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Andrew 
Ang said he helped on the bud-
get  because our A.S. President was 
too busy studying for her LSATS. 
Setting aside for a moment the fact 
that neither the budget nor this life-
altering exam come as a surprise 
(she’s known about the former since 
her election in April, and the lat-
ter happens exactly four times a 
year), there’s still the matter of the 
$10,000-a-year salary that we stu-
dents cough up in the name of secur-
ing an effective head to our student 
government. 

With a paycheck like that, it’s not 
too unreasonable to expect a work 
ethic to match.

L a Jolla Playhouse can’t get enough of the Chaplins. After the whimsi-cal performance of Charlie Chaplin’s 
granddaughter in last season’s “Aurelia’s 
Oratorio,” the Tramp himself gets a 
livelier close-up in the Playhouse’s latest 
production,  “Limelight: The Story of 
Charlie Chaplin.” And no, the irony of 
the silent film star retelling his story in 
piano chords is not lost on anyone. By 
the end of all the musical’s overdrawn 
clichés, though, the delightfully twisted 
vantage point seems uninspired.

Under the direction of Warren 
Carlyle and Michael Unger, “Limelight” 
adds flashy color to the life of a film 
legend usually relegated to reels of black 
and white. The musical traverses largely 
unchartered territory in Chaplin’s life, 
from his orphan days in the late 1800s to 
his debauchery in Hollywood’s Golden 
Age, followed by his downfall at the 
hands of McCarthyism. Sadly, so faith-
ful is the production to the cause of a 
biography that it often forfeits coherence 
in plot. 

The first scene opens with a hapless 
Chaplin (William Youmans) sitting in a 
barren theater at the premiere of his lat-
est film. Nostalgic for his earlier success-
es, Chaplin asks for his first one-reeler 
to be projected onto the screen. Thus 
begins “Limelight’s” frame narrative, as 
out from the screen emerges a cast of 
lower-class Londoners, including young 
Charlie (Jake Evan Schwenke).

ambitious? It is, especially considering the five years it 
took to compile their first album The Spirit of Apollo, 
featuring over 30 guests like Kanye West, David Byrne, 
George Clinton, E-40 and last year’s Sun God dance tent 
headliner Z-Trip.

The diversity-embracing duo of Brazilian pro skate-
boarder DJ Zegon and composer/producer DJ Squeak E. 
Clean (who is also director Spike Jonze’s brother) has a 
knack for threading together head-bobbers with tradi-
tional South American roots. 

Album highlight “N.A.S.A. Music” is a contemporary 
hip hop number that features Method Man, E-40 and DJ 
Swamp and blends heavy urban beats with a sweet mix of 

electro-bleeps and tribal rhythms. 
The popular track “Gifted” gives off a more indie 

vibe, beginning with Owl City-esque xylophone and glass 
tinkling beats that are quickly followed by a rap courtesy 
of Kanye West and airy Lykke Li vocals that hover above 
some electronic vibrations. 

But while N.A.S.A.’s guests are proven talents, amidst 
the input of so many voices, DJs Zegon and Squeak E. 
Clean begin to blend into the milieu. And without the 
presence of more popular collaborators, the live perfor-
mances rarely outshine the recorded tracks. Nonetheless, 
the FallFest DJ set from Squeak E. Clean will likely contain 
enough of N.A.S.A.’s trademark catchy beats to run a club 
from dusk till dawn, and plenty of swagger to keep a party 
energetic. 

N.A.S.A

distortion in favor of glossy, multi-layered jams. 
So, yeah, moshing is perhaps out of the question on this 

one, but that doesn’t mean their FallFest set won’t fulfill your 
drive for rock-n-roll. Mutemath goes all out. They don’t just 
hype up their fans by jumping up and down and screaming that 
tiresome phrase, “I can’t hear you,” into a microphone; simple 
crowd surfing doesn’t cut it for them. Mutemath throws the 
bass drum out into the audience, and then crowd surfs on that. 
Be prepared for one crazy night.

The versatile, tight-knit tracks packed into their only two 
releases — their eponymous EP and the subsequent Armistice 
— have garnered them a rabid fan base that pits them against 
bands such as Muse and Wolfmother at big-ticket festivals like 
Coachella and Lollapalooza. 

Their elaborately designed production is accompanied by 
drummer Darren King’s extraordinary beats, pounding above 
and beyond the typical alt-rock. Lead singer Paul Meany 
also uses his soulful Sting-esque tenor to carry the music 

through every genre from experimental to modern 
dance-rock — and he kills it on the keytar. 

Their music often takes long instrumental 
breaks, allowing the group to truly show off 

their technical prowess, while simultane-
ously giving you plenty of time to 

perfect your drunken sway in the 
crowd. Bassist Roy Mitchell-

Cardenas’s and guitar-
ist Greg Hill’s textured 

rhythms help elevate 

the music to greater heights, skillfully jumbling up 
genres as distinct as jazz, noise-rock and pop into one 
indefinable sound. Tracks like Armistice’s “Backfire” — a 
tuneful drum and guitar showdown — are chaotic, yet 
elegant, and infinitely enjoyable.

That is, unless you like your alt-rock more rough 
around the edges. Prefer Husker Dü to U2? Pearl Jam 
to Third Eye Blind? Fair enough: Spend your time 
pre-gaming for Big Boi instead. But you’ll be missing 
out on one of the most energet-
ic rock shows around.

out on one of the most energet-

Boi showcased his nimble rapping skills in a variety of excel-
lent guest appearances, such as UGK’s “International Players 
Anthem” and “Royal Flush,” a collaboration with fellow 
OutKast-er André 3000 and Wu-Tang alumnus Raekwon.

Big Boi’s solo tracks, while remaining firmly rooted in 
OutKast’s slippery kush-laced pop-rap, tend to sound more 
like futuristic dance floor synth-funk anthems. “Shutterbug” 
— the album’s first single (and its centerpiece, as well as pos-
sible mission statement) — can already be counted as a party-
rap classic, with its irresistible talk-box bass line and chiming 
guitar laying the perfect foundation for Big Boi’s impeccable 
flow. Other standouts include the smooth electric piano jam 
“Turns Me On” and the dramatic, rock-leaning “Tangerine,” 
which includes Big Boi’s memorable assertion that “when she’s 
liquored up/ I’m leaving my fingerprints on her butt.” 

Beyond its flawless production and exceptional rapping, 
one of the album’s most charming features is its diverse cast 
of guest stars, such as T.I., Gucci Mane and rising alt-R&B 
chanteuse Janelle Monáe. These guests are not currently tour-
ing with Big Boi, but even in their absence, his live show has 
earned a reputation as one of the best in modern hip-hop. 
Armed with a small armada of synthesizers, guitars and basses, 
Big Boi will be sure to please the inebriated FallFest audience 
with inventive renditions of tracks from the new album, as 
well as classic OutKast numbers. Hardcore rap aficionados and 
timid freshmen alike can plan on being equally impressed by 
Big Boi’s set.

ALBUMREVIEW

Sufjan Stevens
The Age of Adz
ASTHMATIC KITTY

S ufjan Stevens’ Illinois was an intricate celebration of life and Americana that raised the bar impossibly high for fellow singer-songwriter contenders. That 
was half a decade ago. Since then, he’s given us an album 
of “outtakes,” a five-disc anthology of Christmas songs 
and a soundtrack for his film about the Brooklyn-Queens 
Expressway. Those releases were great and all — albeit 
somewhat random — but they left us wondering: Will our 
erratic hero ever release another Michigan or Seven Swans?

After years of anticipation, The Age of Adz answers this 
question with a resounding “no.” What takes the expected 
folk album’s place, however, is something much more 
intriguing. 

The piano and pizzicato strings of “Futile Devices” 
opens the album with a familiar delicacy, but quickly 
reveal themselves as a bait-and-switch for the surprising 
sounds that filter through the rest of it: glitchy electronic 
beats, sweeping orchestrations and epic choruses. No 
subtle acoustics or simple melodies here — Adz is a dense, 
beautiful mess. 

“Too Much” is quirky, smiling pop, but Stevens’s sheer 
joy and earnestness keeps it from becoming trite or boring. 
The same goes for the 26-minute-long closer “Impossible 
Soul,” which holds our interest well into its exhilarating 
sing-along climax. 

Even when the album descends into atmospheric chaos 
— as in the meandering “Now That I’m Older,” or the mid-
dle-school-marching-band title track — Adz gives way to 
another distinct beat or melody long before it gets tedious. 

In an interview last year for Exclaim! Magazine, Stevens 
mentioned his descent into a full-blown existential music 
crisis. He brooded extensively over the purpose of a song 
and whether he should bother to continue with any future 
albums. 

In Adz, this frustration is apparent. Even with 75 min-
utes at his disposal, there is still a sense that The Age of 
Adz can’t contain all that Stevens wants to say. Toward 
the end, “I Want To Be Well” encapsulates this meltdown, 
leading to a startlingly profound refrain: “I’m not fuck-
ing around/ I’m not, I’m not, I’m not fucking around.” He 
really isn’t.

Folk Hero Orchestrates Existential Crisis

By Rebecca Erbe
Staff Writer

R ed” has star power to spare — the cast is littered with cinematic giants like Bruce Willis, Helen 
Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John 
Malkovich and Mary Louise Parker. 
That’s about where the good points 
end. Despite all the sparkle in the 
credits, the film’s lackluster effort 
is reminiscent of other uninspiring 
action-comedies, except all the players 
are a few decades older. 

“Red” outlines the dull life of 
Frank Moses (Willis), a retired CIA 
agent who spends his time adjusting 
to the suburbs and making glacially 
slow romantic advances over the 
phone to a frumpy woman he has 
never met. But when young CIA oper-
atives attempt to kill him, Frank has to 
figure out why his prior employers are 
after him, roping his telephone girl-
friend and a cast of quirky-yet-deadly 
former coworkers into the ensuing 
debacle. 

There’s Joe (Freeman), aging mas-
ter of disguise, who takes the screen 
with Marvin (Malkovich), a hyper-
paranoid former-LSD-experimentee 
and Victoria (Mirren), a seductive 
but dangerous sharpshooter. Together 
they face the greatest challenge of 
their careers: breaking into the CIA 
and discovering why they have sud-
denly appeared on the government’s 

(s)hit list. Cue “Mission Impossible” 
theme music.

Don’t be fooled — “Red” devolves 
into a lurching archetypal mess by 
the end of the opening credits, try-
ing to salvage a mundane action 
story peppered with retirement 
jokes and an uncomfortably odd 
Hollywood romance between Frank 
and Sarah Ross (Parker). Though the 
action sequences are well-executed 
(Malkovitch blows some bitches’ 
heads off while Willis fights with more 
grace than we could ever muster), 
they seem unnatural for a group of 
actors that probably hold membership 
to the AARP. 

 “Red” has enough blood to film 
another “Saw” and bullets for a red-
neck’s lifetime supply, but the film’s 
other elements fell surprisingly flat. 
Although intended as a nod to Sarah’s 
long-harbored wish to travel, the 
postcard-themed titles looked kiddy-
kitschy in a flick so obsessed with its 

own masculinity. 
Despite its numerous ticks, “Red” 

did do one man good: John Malkovich 
is brilliant as the severely affected 
Marvin. Armed and talented, para-
noid and absolutely insane, Malkovich 
shines. Though we always questioned 
his sanity, the actor’s mania reaches 
new heights. Touting an enthusiasm 
akin to an overgrown kid at a candy 
carnival, Malkovitch swings an over-
sized gun like a bat, hitting grenades 
back to their punk-ass sources as 
he spits, curses and cackles. Taking 
us back to the zenith of spy action, 
Malkovich reminds us why it’s awe-
some to, well, be John Malkovich.

Sadly, outside of the Malkovich 
variety hour, “Red” struggles by on 
life support. The minds behind “Red” 
seem to think action is the best rem-
edy for Alzheimer’s and arthritis. We 
think Grandpa will agree; age may 
come before beauty, but never before 
plot.

Chaplin Biopic Fades Into Trite Glitz

guidance. “Once you find the 
story behind each [person],” she 
instructs him in song, “then you 
just play the part.” But Charlie’s 
family ties are soon reduced 
to shambles when Hannah is 
declared insane and the mutton-
chopped owner of an orphanage 
steals Charlie and his brother Sid 
away from her. 

The brothers live off filch-
ing until their slapstick means 
of robbery catch the attention 
of music hall owner Fred Karno  
(Eddie Korbich). From there, 
Charlie (now played by the older 
Rob McClure) gets recruited to 
American silent film. He takes a 
leap of faith across the pond, only 
to be met by the capitalist ten-
dencies of Hollywood directors 
who forgo things like “character” 
and “rehearsals” for the idiosyn-
crasies that made him the big 
bucks.  From this downtrodden 
onset is born the iconic Tramp: 
the moustache, bowler hat, baggy 
pants and handicapped walk. 
“Look how I’ve changed my 
story,” he tells the audience, in 
awe of his own fame. 

  In spite of the upbeat num-
bers and vaudeville throwback, 
“Limelight” remains predomi-
nantly doleful in tone. One of 
the most amusing (and too infre-

quent) scenes features Charlie 
lampooning Hitler in his first 
talkie, “The Great Dictator,” 
where he attunes “I’m a Little 
Teapot” to the gesticulations and 
acrid tone of Hitler in a dead-on 
voiceover. But there’s not enough 
goof, not enough guffaw. 

Though it breaks new ground 
in its retelling of Chaplin’s life, 
“Limelight” ultimately finds 
itself to be a schmaltzy musical. 
It’s rife with morals that rival 
the likes of Forrest Gump. Take, 
for example, Charlie’s epiphany 
in the final scene: “Life isn’t a 
movie. You can’t go back and edit 
it.” Profound.

The songs, composed by 
Christopher Curtis, are catchy 
on first listen but easily forget-
table. Some duets have the actors 
singing simultaneously over one 
another in a way that neither set 
of lyrics are clear. 

 “Limelight” is buttressed 
by the talent of its supporting 
actors. Matthew Scott’s Sid, in 
particular, is compassionate as an 
older brother should be, without 
becoming trite. But “Limelight” 
serves as a reminder that flapper 
pizzazz and reverberant tunes 
alone can’t account for a good 
musical. As with the silent films 
of Chaplin’s time, sometimes 
black and white is just fine.

Lil Wayne
I Am Not A Human Being
YOUNG MONEY

S omewhere deep within Rikers Penitentiary, Lil Wayne is laugh-ing. You’d laugh too, if — like 
Weezy —you could release anything 
(even behind bars), regardless of 
quality, and still sell millions of copies. 

Lil Wayne’s new EP, I Am Not A 
Human Being, can easily give off a 
half-assed vibe. But while a lot of the 
music initially sounds uninspired, 
you still can’t deny that Wayne is one 
of the most inventive lyricists around.

Exhibit A: “And when I came/ She 
caught me like the common cold,” 
Wayne asserts on the standout Drake 
track “With You.” Yes, his rhymes are 
still hilarious, disgusting and some-
times brilliant.  Exhibit B: “Pussy in 
the bedroom,” Weezy raps on “Hold 
Up,” “pass that bitch down like an 
heirloom.” It comes off as absurd, but 
with his signature raspy delivery, the 
rhyme almost sounds genius.

Other highlights include “I’m 
Single” — a bleak examination of the 
pratfalls of relationship status — and 
the bizarrely straightforward Nicki 
Minaj track, “What’s Wrong With 

Them.” Despite such gems, the album 
lacks some of the magic that made 
Tha Carter III so refreshing. 

Most of the tracks are listenable, 
but some, like the rock-leaning title 
track, are just plain bad. Though 
not as embarrassing as anything off 
Rebirth (Weezy’s regrettable attempt 
at rock music), it still leaves you 
wishing you could prevent Wayne 
from ever discovering guitars in the 
first place.

Wayne’s rhymes still harbor the 
maniacal glee that made his previous 
albums such a delight, but he just 
seems slightly off his game. His flow 
is lazier than usual, and his similes 
and puns are a shade less clever. 
Unfair as these high standards may 
seem, for someone like Lil Wayne — 
who has proven himself as a dynamic 
performer before — this lack of 
attention is unforgivable. 

But a sub-par Lil Wayne album 
is still a Lil Wayne album, and we’ll 
take what we can get.

The Fresh & Onlys
Play it Strange
IN THE RED

T he first decade of the 2000s had music veering in every direc-tion with the advent of digital 
production and more fad genres than 
you can shake a drumstick at.  Still, 
as titillating as novelty is, sometimes 
all we crave is the noise of yesteryear.  

Cue The Fresh & Onlys.  One 
of many recent acts to forgo the 
modern in favor of reanimating an 
earlier era, they’ve attained exposure 
in under two years for their music’s 
psychedelic tendencies.  Play It 
Strange continues their cloudy reso-
nance by minimizing production, or 
at least concealing evidence of any.  
String and percussion melt into a 
homogenous sea, and lead vocalist 
Tim Cohen swirls in his voice almost 
indistinguishably. But unfortunately, 
indistinguishable becomes far too big 
of a key word here, as the album fails 
to make any kind of unique impact. 

The band strays far enough from 
mainstream rock to find a niche 
sound, but they exercise it by recy-
cling song structures.  The album 
scouts the same frontier for so long 

that it feels like an actual road trip — 
after a while, you just want to curl up 
in the backseat and take a nap. 

Their last full-length, Grey-Eyed 
Girls, became an underground hit for 
similar     fuzzy tunage.  But lost is the 
kick-in-the-pants factor that previ-
ously transported them to another 
era.  Play it Strange shows the talent 
and vision needed for a journey, yet it 
refuses to travel in new directions. 

Sure, the aesthetic can be fetch-
ing.  The band cavorts between 
surf and rockabilly in songs like 
“All Shook Up“ and “Waterfall.” Yet 
tracks like the classily named “By My 
Hooker” follow, droning along and 
repeating the same hazy lo-fi reverbs 
and vintage-punk warbles.

While there are a few pleasant 
moments, the album becomes a 
muddled reverie by the end.  Indeed, 
The Fresh & Onlys live up to their 
moniker on this record.  They have 
a refreshingly unrefined sound. Too 
bad it’s the only sound they make.

“We don’t want to have easy games because we 
like the nail-biter and we like to give me gray hair,” 
Luyties said. “I think that’s the key — the more 
close games we can get in this year, the better.”

Joking aside, the Tritons will have to find a 
consistent rotation if they hope to make the play-
offs. With 11 matches remaining in the regular 
season, there’s still time for the team to hit its  
stride, but the race will certainly be closer than the 
Tritons expected.

Time to celebrate, pop the… ginger ale?

The best moment in game five of the American 
League Division Series between the Texas Rangers 
and Tampa Bay Rays didn’t actually happen during 
the game. Cliff Lee’s performance was certainly 
impressive: He became only the fourth pitcher in 
history to throw a complete game and record 10 

strikeouts in a winner-take-all postseason game. 
But Lee’s masterpiece was topped by the Rangers’ 
celebration afterward.

For those unfamiliar with the Rangers’ Josh 
Hamilton, he was considered a “can’t miss” pros-
pect out of the 1999 MLB draft. Hamilton then fell 
victim to drug and alcohol addiction, falling out 
of the game and hitting near rock bottom. It took 
several years, but Hamilton got his act together and 
has emerged as one of the game’s top players.

Hamilton’s clean and sober lifestyle doesn’t 
exactly fit in with the traditional baseball celebra-
tion of dousing the entire clubhouse in champagne. 
While the Texas club did break out the bubbly 
to commemorate winning the series, they also 
brought along some ginger ale so Hamilton could 
participate. 

Hamilton has gone from ultimate disappoint-
ment to legitimate role model, and he deserves to 
celebrate the victory. Kudos to the Texas Rangers 
for showing so much class.

In the coming year, keep an eye out for the 
return of junior standout swimmer Alex Henley, 
who took first place in the 200-yard butterfly 
and 400-yard individual medley, as well as 
placed second in two other events at nationals 
last year. Henley, whose skill and speed have 
been a boost for the Tritons in her previous two 
years, has been elected captain for the upcom-
ing year.

“One thing to note about Alex is her humil-
ity,” McGihon said. “When she wins, she doesn’t 
need to make a show of it. I think you’ll find 

that among swimmers. She celebrates after the 
victory, not before the victory. It’s a good feel-
ing, having her coming back. She gives a boost 
to other athletes because she helps them elevate 
their level.”

With a large number of returning swim-
mers, another terrific year for both the men and 
women doesn’t seem out of reach. The Tritons 
will open their season on Saturday with the Blue 
vs. Gold meet at 11 a.m. at Canyonview Pool.

Readers can contact Tyler Nelson at tcnelson@
ucsd.edu.

The Tritons are 7-4-1 all-time against the 
Wildcats, although the teams played to a 1-1 
tie in their only meeting last season.

UCSD will then take on Cal State 
Stanislaus on Sunday, when the Warriors 
will try to move up from their second place 
position in the CCAA North Division stand-
ings. The Tritons need to be prepared for a 
physical game, as Cal State Stanislaus leads 
the CCAA in both fouls committed and yel-
low cards.

The Tritons will kick off against Chico 

State at 7 p.m., while Sunday’s game will 
begin at 2 p.m.

The women’s squad has had similarly 
impressive results, as it pushed its unbeaten 
streak to seven matches with a pair of week-
end wins. The Tritons followed a 2-1 win 
over Dominguez Hills with a 1-0 win against 
then-No. 15 Cal State Los Angeles, extending 
their win streak to four games. 

Junior Annie Wethe scored the lone 
goal against Cal State Los Angeles, and 
was named CCAA Player of the Week for 
her efforts. Wethe also provided the assist 
for the opening goal of the match against  
Dominguez Hills. Wethe has scored three 
goals for the Tritons this season, all of which 
have been game-winning.

The Tritons’ success was rewarded with a 
return to the national rankings, with UCSD 
sitting at No. 22 in the latest poll. After the 
slate of weekend games, the Tritons sit just 
one point out of first place in the CCAA 
South Division. 

The squad will have its chance to jump 
into first place against a struggling Chico 
State team on Friday. The Wildcats are 1-3-0 
in their last four matches and were shutout 
in all three losses. 

UCSD will move on to host No. 24 Cal 
State Stanislaus on Sunday. The Warriors are 
currently leading the CCAA North Division 
with a 9-2-1 overall record, although UCSD 
is 9-1-1 all-time against Stanislaus. 

The games will be at 4:30 p.m. and 11:30 
a.m., respectively.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

This Week: water polo flying high, volleyball  tries to find peak form 
and the Rangers celebrate their playoff 
win.

Water Polo Downs Pepperdine and 
LMU

The UCSD Men’s Water Polo team 
quietly had an outstanding weekend at 
the SoCal Tournament, emerging vic-
torious in the consolation after drop-
ping their opening match to then-No. 
4 Stanford. 

The highlight of the tourna-
ment was back-to-back wins over 
Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount, 
neither of whom the Tritons had 
beaten since the 2006 season. Both 
squads are perennial contenders for 
the national title, with Pepperdine 
winning a championship in 1997 and 
LMU reaching the national semifinals 
each of the last three years.

But these wins are impressive pre-
cisely because they are not surprising. 
Water polo is likely UCSD’s strongest 
sports program, routinely playing with 
the nation’s best and — like last week-
end — being extremely competitive 
while doing so. The Tritons do all of 
this as only a partial scholarship pro-
gram, which in reality means only a few 
hundred dollars. By contrast, UCSD’s 
opponents offer full scholarships, 
allowing them to attract the nation’s 
best (which really means California’s 
best) water polo players.

To put this in perspective, imagine 
asking University of San Diego’s foot-
ball team to compete with UCLA, or 
Ohio Dominican University to beat 
Ohio State. Quite simply, it’s not going 
to happen. 

Close Games for Triton Volleyball

While the UCSD Women’s 
Volleyball team has won three of their 
last four matches, none of the games 
have been easy. The squad has strug-
gled with a lack of consistency, which 
leads to streaky play that keeps every 
game interesting. 

 This fact has not been lost on 
coach Ricci Luyties, who addressed his 
team’s performance more than a little 
sarcastically after its latest win over Cal

SWIMMING & DIVING — After a long summer with 
time to reflect and refocus, the swim and dive team has high 
expectations for the coming year. The team hopes to pick up 
from where it left off: At the end of last year, the swim team 
placed first in its conference, and the men’s team finished 
seventh at nationals while the women’s team finished third. 
This year, the team expects to equal, or even better, that per-
formance.

“My predictions are that we are planning to repeat as con-
ference champions,” head coach Scott McGihon said. “The last 
three years the men have been around seventh and the women 
have placed around third, but we want to take a big step for-
ward and break into the top four for the men and stay up in 
the top three on the women’s side. I think we are fully capable 
of accomplishing this.”

As with all collegiate teams, UCSD student-athletes often 
leave for the summer and are responsible for their own train-
ing. This is especially true in swimming, where it is necessary 
to keep a base level of fitness year-round. For many, training 
involved joining summer clubs and going through doubles 
every day, while others view rest and light training as the best 
use of the offseason.

“Wherever they are, they need to keep training,” McGihon 
said. “We check in with their [summer] coaches, to see if 
they’ve been doing what we told them to do, but that’s more 
of a periodic thing.”

The actual regimen followed, however, can vary greatly 
from athlete to athlete.  

“Usually I don’t train very hard during the summer,” 
returning captain and senior Anju Shimura said. “Usually I 
take a break. I came back to San Diego early so I can start 
training and it really helped a lot.”

Regardless of the amount of summer training, the school 
year is back in session and the season is about to begin. With 
a bevy of new athletes and plenty of returning veterans, the 
team is positive as it prepares for the new season.

“Practices have been going really well,” Shimura said. “The 
team is bonding well and everyone is working really hard. We 
have a big team this year, but we’re having the best time.”

In his final season, Shimura sees the possibility for another 
successful year for the team.

“My hopes for this season are really high,” Shimura said. 
“We have a lot of really fast swimmers and they’re going to 
push the team to go super fast, so I’m really excited.”

The Tritons will have to deal with the loss of Dan Perdew, 
one of the greatest swimmers in school history. Perdew won 
five national championships in his time as a Triton.

While the team may not be in mid-season form yet, it 
looks to take a strong start off the block and into the water.

“It’s always fun to see everybody again,” McGihon said. 
“Everybody is excited since they haven’t seen the entire team 
in a while. But everyone knows that it’s time for business; 
everybody is happy to be back, but we all know that we are 
on a mission.”

TRITONS HOPE TO STAY HOT AT HOME THIS WEEKEND

SOCCER — The men’s and women’s soccer teams 
hope to keep their unbeaten streaks alive this week-
end with home games against Cal State Stanislaus 
and Chico State.

After going winless in their first five games, the 
men’s squad has not lost for the last six matches — 
the longest current streak in the conference. In these 
matches, the Tritons have gone 4-0-2, allowing just 
one goal in that stretch. They’re now coming off an 
impressive weekend, having earned a draw with Cal 
State Dominguez Hills and fought for a narrow 1-0 
win over Cal State Los Angeles. 

“Even early on in the season, we felt like we 
were playing pretty well, but we weren’t finishing 
our chances and we had a tendency to make one or 
two mistakes that would lead to goals for the other 
team,” head coach Jon Pascale said.  “Nothing drastic 

has changed; we’ve just gotten a little bit better each 
week.”

The Triton defense has stepped up to prevent 
these big mistakes, working to cut the goals allowed 
per game.

“We’ve really focused on making sure that if a 
team is going to get a goal on us, it’s going to come 
from something special,” Pascale said. “We’ve really 
tightened up the screws defensively.”

The Tritons face a tough test on Friday against 
No. 14 Chico State, the team that sits atop the CCAA 
North Division with a 7-3 conference record. The 
Wildcats started the season with a five-game win 
streak, but are 1-2-1 in their last four matches.

“Every weekend is challenging,” Pascale said. 
“Every team in the conference is good. I think on 
Friday we’ll be happy to be playing at home. Last 
weekend we had a great crowd and it really helped.”
