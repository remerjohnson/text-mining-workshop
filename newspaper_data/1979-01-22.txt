Jap~nese Sponsor Housing at UCSD 
By Eric Harpell 

Slaff Wri&er 
In exchange for free housing 

for Japanese students at UCSD, 
a Japan-based corporation 
may build a housing complex 
on Warren College that would 
house 108 students. 

Interlang. the Japanese 
corporation that specializes in 
providing opportunities for 
apanese students to gain 

maximum proficiency in the 
English language. will build 'l:l 
apartments on the Warren 

ollege campus. In return for 
the apartments. UCSD will 
provide nine years of free 
housing space for the Interlang 
students. 

Currently, Interland sends 

"approximately 40 students a 
quarter, with one student to be 
as igned per suite in th 
residence halls." said Larry, 
Barrett, director of Housing 
and Food Services. In recent 
years, the housing shortage has 
caused a marked decline in 
space available for Interlang 
students. As a result . Interlang 
officials proposed that they 
provide additional housing, to 
be used at the discretion of the 
University, in return for free 
housing for their students. 

The housing project will be 
located between Miramar 
Road and Interstate 5 on the 
Warren Campus. The prin-
ciple behind Interlang, that 
Japanese students learn 

English best by residing in an 
environment where !lnly 
English is spoken. n es itates 
a small Japanese-to-American 
ratio in the living quarters. As a 
result . only a small percentage 
of the Interlang tudents will be 
residing in the new housing 
complex . 

In accordance with pa t 
procedure , the J apanese 
students from Interlang will be 
housed, one pe r suite, in the 
various on-campus residence 
halls. The remaining spaces in 
the new housing "wi ll probably 
be used by Warren Students, " 
said Barrett. 

According to Barrett, UCSD 

will receive a number of 
monetary advantages from 
having Interlang build the new 
complex. " We won't have to go 
out and borrow the money." 
said Barrett. " That way there 
is no interest to pay . If we had 
been able to ave in a similar 
way (i n building existing on-
campus housing) . housing 
costs would be three or four 
hundred dollars less per 
student. " 

Although. Food and Housing 
Services sees many advan-
tage in the Interlang housing 
project. the UC Board of 
Regent has expressed 
reservations . Said Barrett "the 
Regents will look at the 

commitment with a foreign 
power- will w open the doors 
to commitment that will not be 
beneficial?" However. Barrett 
stressed that Inte rlang " has no 
political interest. ' , 

Negotiation are continuing 
betwee n Un'iversity and 
Interlang officials. but no 
immediate progress is forseen. 
" We sent a draft of our 
agreements." said Barrett, 
speaking of the latest step in 
negotiations. " but their reply 
showed that they probably 
misunderstood ." The next step 
in negoti a tions will be a 
meeting between University 
Officia ls and the president of

Saxon Says 'No Campuses Will Close 
By Trapper Byrne 

Special to the Guardian 
San Francisco - Regardless of 
how severe the University of 
California's financial problems 
become, no uc campuses will 
be closed. University President 
David Saxon declared here 
Friday before the Board of 
Regents. 

Sa on c laimed that if a 
campu weI' to be clo ed. 
tudent from it could not be 

absorbed into the rest of the UC 
system . He a dd e J the 
University believes on the ba is 
of tat demographic projec-
tions that the number of 18 
year-olds in California , aft r a 
period of decline beginning in 
1982, will increa e around 1995 \ 
and exceed the pre ent number 
of 18 year-olds by 2010. 

If this does happen , Saxon 
claimed, it "could not onlv 
erase the decline we immedi-
ately face but add a demand for 
thousands of new places in the 
University beyond those we 
now ha ve." 

However, Saxon cited similar 
state demographic studies in 
the 1960's which indictlted a 
greater expected population 
growt h than occurred , a 
prediction that contributed in 
part to UC's decision to build 

--

more cam puses. Campuse 
co nstructed and ex panded 
during those years are now in 
many case undercrowded . 

To try to meet budget 
constraints. the Board ptl sed a 
motion Thursday to rai . out-
oC-s tate tuition from 1.905 to 
$2.400 per year , effective next 
Call. Saxon said at a press 
co nference Thursdu y thul 
Governor J er r y Brown ' s 
propo ed C budget. which 
a lready lops off $7 .7 million of 

ni versity operuti ng fund. 
was drawn up by Brown on the 
as um!Jtion th<lt the tuition 
would be raised. 

The Regent ' Committe on 
Finance e tim<lted that the 

niversity will realize an 
a ddition<ll $3 .5 million from the 
tuilion incre<lse. 

Saxon said Friday that 
although he didn 't know how 
UC will r<lise money that may 
be cut from its budget over the 
long-term, he would not rule out 
program cuts , and warned th<lt 
" major changes <Ire un<lvoid-
able. " 

Saxon added that although he 
does " not want to increa e 
s tudent fees. " and " will 
recommend an increas ' to the 
Regents only when there is no 
reasonable alternati e ." he 

would not e limin a t e the 
po sibility from con ideration. 
Saxon has assigned the tas k of 
produc ing a financi a l plan for 
the University for the next few 
year to the Aca demi c 
Planning and Program Revic\ 
Board. 

Saxon told the campu 

cha ncellor " Thursday night 
that $20 million they had been 
told to earm .. lrk for po sible 
cuts after the niver "ity lost 
$15.9 million of operating funds 
with the pas age of Propo ilion 
13 will have to be pcrma .. ::-":· 
eliminated from their budget . 

The niver 'ity had hoped 

that the cut would b re tor d 
next ear . but Governor 
Brown' propo ed budget 
tipulates that they will not. C 

San Diego's share of the $20 
million is about $1.4 million.

cut about 4 million from it

Administration Ignores Needs of Deaf 
Editor: 

In no place is there a more 
lackluster attempt at the 
maill8treaming of handicapped 
students, the deaf in particular, 
than at the University of 
California, San Diego. 

Deaf persons, long neglected 
because of the ancient Aristotle 
philosophy that they were 
" de af and dumb ", are 
presently advancing a nd 
emerging into the ociety. At 
thi time they are the si ngle 
la rgest group of ha ndicapped 
people in the nation. 

The red-no ed. red-ta ped 
bureaucracy a nd admi ni s-
tration of UCSD forms an 
impenetrable barrier to the 
higher education of this groUI). -

The administration's "all-for-
us-none-f or-you" philosophy , 
along with un equally 
uncooperative faculty (par-
ticularly in the biology und 
science depts . ) forms a 
financial and polilical 
monopoly that seriously 
hinders the education of the 
deaf. This monopol y is 
responsible for the fifteen-year 
delay in beWng barriers 
removed a nd obtaining 
financial assista n ce for 
in terpreters. 

The discrimination of the 
deaf is in no place more readily 
ap pare nl th an within th e 
handicap oeiety of UCSD. This 
innercampus-based group of 
disabled tudent, named the 

Guardian Should 
Have Acknowledged 
King Anniversary 
Editor: 

- Disabled Students Services. 
are led by a very displaced 
coordinator. This group of 
mobility disabled students are 
easily recognized by their 
" pave (concrete) way for me" 
atLitude and their gold -
rimmed . diamond-s tudded 
wheelchairs. 

The gold-rimmed, diamond-
s tudded description of this 
group is not an overstatement. 
Supported by the political 
monopoly th a t they have 

created over the other 
handicapped groups . these 
mobility impaired students (as 
opposed to the sensually 
impaired, like the deaf and 
visu ... l handicapped) have 
obtained over $300.000 before a 
single cent had been spent for 
the deaf. This is responsible for 
the unmistakably low deaf 
population at UCSD. 

[n this time of change and 
adva ncement we will see new 
changes made for and by the 

deaf. However, do not look fo r 
these changes at UCSD for the 
bureaucracy and monopoly of 
the mobility impaired has 
destroyed what ground that has 
been gained by the deaf. 
Perhaps some day in the future 
things will reverse; but at the 
rate that UCSD is going, I do not 
see uch an optimistic outlook 
in store.

The failure of The Guardian 
to acknowledge the birth date of 
one of· our nation's greatest 
lea der i very di turbi ng . 
Maybe you felt that Revelle's 
"Almost Anyth ing Goes " 
ceremony took precedent over 
havi ng a n article on Dr. Martin 
Luther King , Jr. And not only 
did you ignore his birth date in 
Monday 's edition. but you al 0 
failed to cover any of Dr. King 'S 
commemorative events in 
Wedne day 's edition . Perhaps 
you will a llow me to write 

perfection. The songs of the 
gos pel ingers combi ned with 
the words of the s peakers pillS 
the reaction of the aud ience 
gave me a truer meaning of 
what Dr. King 's dream is a ll 
"bout. I doubt if anyone left that 
auditorium without some en e 
of renewal about the meaning 
of his " dre<Jm ." Crafts Center Unpopular

I ) Only 10(Y, of the student 
body uses the CraCt Center, and 
it ranks 19th out of 20 major 
student services in importance. 
The most freqllent response to 
the question of importance was 
" not impol·tant".

answered the question said thut

Iranian Prime Minister 
Will Not Resign Office 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Prime 
Minister Shah pour Bakhtiar 
vowed yesterday he would not 
be driven from office by the 
return of Ayatullah Khomeini 
from exile. He huddled with top 
security a ides to plan for the 
arrival of the charismatic 
Moslem leader. 

.• All the nonsense and rumors 
that the newspa p e rs are 
writing about my resignation is 
untrue," the embattled prime 
minister told the Irania n people 
in a broa dcast address. " I am 
going to remain in the 
stronghold of the constitution." 

From his headquarters-in-
exile in France, Khomeini 
charged that Shah Mohamm ad 
Reza Pahlavi, who a ppointed 
Bakhtiar before being forced 
out of Iran by a popular 
uprising backed by Khomeini, 
wa planning a military coup to 
return to power. 

The 78-year-old Khomeini 
wants to abolish the monarchy 
and set up an Islamic republic 
to replace Bakhtiar's govern-
ment, which he deno~nces as a 

tool of the shah a nd of foreign 
interests. 

Factional strife continued. 
Pro-Khomeini demonstators 
marched in Tehran, pro-shah 
gangs reportedly harassed 
motorists in the capital, and a 
Marxist guerrilla group 
warned Khomeini against 
"sufCocating Creedoms" if he 
takes command of the nation. 

The Moslem elder, in exile for 
14 years, is expected to be 
welcomed by hundreds of 
thousands oC jubilant Iranians 
as the ma n who will abolish the 
monarchy. 

Khomeini is to arrive aboard 
a chartered Iran Air jetliner 
piloted by volunteers from the 
strike-bound Iranian airline.

R e Task Force Promotes Awareness 
By Joh. HoiKIros 

As iale News Editor 
"It's an inevitable scheme of 

life - one ut of every 10 people 
is going to be raped," said 
Randy Woodard, advisor to the 
UCSD Rape Prevention Task 
Force. 

The task force, formed last 
spring through the Women's 
Center, endeavors to tell the 
campus community that rape 
and the threat of rape can be 
made less frightening through 
education and increased 
awareness. 

.. (The Rape Prevention Task 

Force's) primary goal is to 
present workshops to muke the 
campus aware of the i ue of 
rape," said Woodard, who is 
also chair of the Disubled 
Students Union. "We promote 
self <lwaregess for men <lnd 
women, and discuss personal 
sufety." 

Stati tics reveal that 
instunces of rape were up 22 
percent last year . suid 
Woodard . "I don' t know if there 
was an increa e in incident of 
rape, but the reporting 
mechanism ha gone up," he 
added.

TONITE 7:00 pm 
Revelle Community Center 

According to Patti Mellor. 
chair of the Rape Prevention 
Ta k Force, there have been no 
rf'ported rapes at UCSD. "But 
rape has occurred in close 
proximity (of the campus)," 
he said. 
The ta k force compiled "A 

Rape Awareness Handbook" at 
the beginning of the school 
year. The handbook dispels 
some common myths about 
rape and presents information 
LO be used in the event of a 
sexual a S<lUlt, or in the event of . 
the threat of an assault. Copies 
of the handbook are available 

at the Women's Center, locClted 
in the Student Center. 

Workshops, which are 
conducted by a trained staff, 
are offered here by the task 
Corce . T he format of the 
workshop includes the showing 
of a film, "Rape: A Preventive 
Inquiry," and a discussion on 
rape awareness and prevention 
techniques. 

"We usually get JO to 20 
people at the workshops , " said 
Mellor. "The participants are 
primarily women, though we 
encourage men to come: they 
are also subject to rape, plus

they may be involved with a

enable Cl man to understand 
what is going on, emotionally ,

The La k force i funded 
through interim support from

Arrairs Richard Armitage and

Mellor. • 'The money is used

Woodard. 

Woodard cited three 
local ions on campu , where a

- The wooded area between

embarnlss one's friends on

Not satisfied with mere

has put these discoverie into 
prm:lical action: the first into a 
program called Phi week, and 
the second into a LJ'a veling 
mini-hapJ)Cning known as the 
Revelle Birthday Gram. 

Phi week. which begins today 
on the Revelle Plaz" under the 
sponsorship of the Revelle 
Program Board (RPBl. exists 
extensively to measure the 
proportion of navel heighl to 
total body height. a ratio thal 
should equal Phi. What Phi is

the myslel'ious Adolf Zie ·ing. 

Ziesing's bold <:Iaim was that 
Phi. which is an irl'atioml l 
number computable by 
dividing total body height plu . 

navel height by navel height 
alone, is the exact loca tion of 
Ihe perfectly proportioned 
person 's (PPP) belly button. 
Why Ziesing suid this is 
unknown. 

Phi week 's birth as a Revelle 
activity was midwifed by two 
Revelle resident . junior lexis

Inlerlang. Final approval will 
come from the Regents. 

Housing will be free for 
Interlang students during a 
nine year period. After that 
the cost of the housing provided 
by the University to Japane e 
students will have exceeded the 
cost to Interlang for building 
the apartments, and Interlang 
will once again be responsible 
for housing costs. Only housing 
space will be provided free of 
charge to the students. Meal 

plans, reg fee and other costs 
will be pclid by the Interlang 
studcnts . 

According to Barrelt, ther is 
no projecl imilar to the 
Interlang housing proposal in 
any other U nited States 
university. There is, however, a 
similar language program at 
Sunta Cruz, but no foreign·built \ 
housing projects are foreseen 
there. Barrett commented that 
the availability of housi ng at

Pleasure 'Reading at the Bookstore 
By Chris Sberman 

Just as I finished uttering my 
last curse at the bookstore for 
only ordering sixteen copies of 
Soybean Management (or the 
300 people in my Visual Arts 
class, I realized that I could use 
the remaining twenty dollars or 
so to pick up a few books to read 
when I wanted to do nothing 
other than relax. These would 
be the literary gems that would 
have a cathartic errect, sort of 
Ii ke getting stoned or counting , 
the number of religions on the 
head of a pin . 

The Murder of Roger 
Ackroyd , Agatha Christie's 
first published novel, is one of 
the finest examples of the 
double-jackknife twist who-
dunn it I have ever read. The 

Casually 
Sophisticated 

OPEN 
lATE 
• Spogt,..; 
• PIrz.a 
• Bounlilul 

Sondwochts 
• BHr 
• Wine 

story takes place during the 
post-Victorian 20s in a small 
British hamlet, and introduces 
Christie's ' best character, the 
Belgian detective Hercule 
PoroiL POI'oit is a later-day 
Holmes, who uses a quaint but 
highly efficient form oC 
psychology to catcb crooks, 
Poroit is a little 

effeminate and elegant, but his 
mClnner and his insights always 
seem to delight the reader. And 
although Dame Agatha rarely 
strays from a conventional 
sleuth formula , she is careful to 
burp her reader before leaving 
off. . 

The UCSD bookstore does 
have a few points in its favor, 

one being the excellent 
selection of science fiction and 
fantasy paperbacks . Roger 
Zelazny is a name known to any 
fan, but seems to escape the 
attention of the general reading 
public. Nine Princes in Amber 
was published several years 
ago as the beginning of a 
proposed trilogy. There are 

now four books out with a fifth 
due soon. The story dea Is 
primarily with reality -
"Amber" is the only " real" 
planet existing in the universe. 
Everything else is just a 
shadow of the real thing. It 
seems that the throne is up for 
grabs. so now all of the royal 
family is speedily rna king their 
way through the shadow 
realities to Amber itself, where 
a great war is in progress. 
Zelazny has a loose, rough style 
that is wonderful for character 
development and while the 
story won't leave you 
breathless, it is certainly far 
more interesting than much of 
the "history" that is recorded 
concerning the third shadow 
reality from the sun. . 

The classic in reality 
escapism must be the 
wonderful fiction that Carlos 
Casteneda has set in the 
Mexican desert not too far 
south of here. Probably the best 
of the four published books is A 
Separate Reality ; in which 
much of the magical ground-
work so ca refully planted by 
the author in the first two books 
actually materializes - people 
disappear and reappear else-
where, leap across waterfalls 
at nearly a single bound, and 

Quite a mouthrul of books LO devour aL one time. (Please turn to page 12)

'Toys in the Attic' 
an Old Globe Success 
By Jill Louise Bazeley 

Contributing Editor 
The Old Globe Theatre's 3 act 

production of Toys in the Attic 
is a steamy, but slow-moving 
success. Lillian Hellman's 
play, directed by Craig Noel, 
delivers a languid discourse on 
the destructi ve aspects of love 
and the acquisition of wealth. 
The setti ng is that ponderous 
part of the south - Tennessee 
William country - where "the 
hot damp climate puts mildew 
on truth." 

Miss Hellman says this about 
the story: " I started out with a 
man, his two unmarried sisters 
who ruised him, and his wife. 
All the women love him and 
seem to want him to be 
successful - he never halt been 
- but once he is. they find they 
,don't want him that wuy. They 
are scared of losing him to 
success." In the munner of 
southern literature, the plot 
becomes hotter and hotter 
under the collar us the two 
siste r s· Carrie and Anna 
Berniers. and the wife Lily. 
come into confli ct with e<Jch 
other. and with the truth. The 
only wonwn in the pl<JY who i 
nol deeply entangled in the 
situation is Lily" mother, a 
colOl'less night-creature who 
has withdr"lwn from th> world 
10 live with her negro f'<Jncy 
ma n . Thl' my ' tique of A Ibel'ti ne 
Prine. who is ut once 
completely sensible and utterly 
decadent. sift s mencingly 
Ihl'Ough the fit bric of Toys 
in the Allic. For though she i ' . 
successful , and lovi ng. hl'r 
weirdness is a discouraging

quality, but John Wesley 
Houston's portrayal of Henry, 
the fancy man, is singularly 
impressive. The most difficult 
acting ta k , in my opinion, is 
that of remaining on stage for a 
long time without the relief of 
speech. Mr. Houston 's sober 
attitudes , maintained in 
powerful quiet for minutes at a 
time, add a certain swel-
teringly evil quality not only to 
the purulent inscruta bility of 
his mistress, but to the entire 
production as well . 

The beautiful stage setting, 
designed by Nick Reid is a 
c uriously deceptive , gray 
gingerbread house. washed in 

the paint-box veneer of Steph 
Storer's lighting. On first view, 
with the aid of the distorting 
colors of light, the effect is cute 
and innocent - a thematic 
antithesis - but when studied 
carefully, the hou e reveals 
itself as monochromatic . 
delapidated and overgrown 
with frightening and exotic 
plants. 

I recommend this production 
but for its length and the two 
intermi sions. Some people. 
however. may delight in the 
double opportunity to dish out a 
dollar fOI' a miserable piece of 
aristocratic chocolate at the 
Spreckels Theatre sni.lck bar -
who knows?

Tritons Win In Overtime Thriller 
By Kevin Elliou 

A spirit-filled o'owd filled the 
Main Gym Saturday night for 
UCSY s Second Annual Spirit Night 
<Jnd they were treated to an 
exciting triple overtine contest 
ag",inst Cui B<.Iptist. Johnny Cox 
cooly sank five key (l'CCthrowS ina 
row in thf: third ovt..'1tme pt.'1·iod to 
give the Tritons a wild 83-81 
victory. 

Cox made the crucial free 
throws, but it was starting 
gual'ds Kevin "S mooth " 
Dougbs and Tom Om<Jlev who 

ca .... ied UCSD to the victory. 
Playing their be t games of the 
'ea on, Douglas and Omalev 
got the Tritons going in the first 
half as they I'epeatedly hit long 
range jumpers over a tough 
zone defen e by Cal Baptist. 
Befol'e fouling out in the third 
ovcrtime, both scored season 
highs . Douglas tullying 18 
points und Omalev a gamc high 
24 points.

quick six point lead. Cal Baptist 
regained composure. however, 

and .. Ifter ten minutes oC the 
first half pulled even with tile 
Triton . The visitors seemed to 
be charged up by the alien 
cl'Owd :also and took a five point 
lead into the locker room at 
halftime, 38-33 . 

CSD came out smoking in 
the econd half and finally 
gr<Jbbed the lead on the 
strength of Lehm<Jn Brockett ' . 
inside game und more hot 
shooting by Douglas and 
Omalev . Thc lead changed 
hands several times and with a 
minute to play , the score wa ' 
knotted 64-64. Both learn 
worked for l<Jst second shot . 
but UCSD had the best shot to 
win the conlest whcn Douglas' 
last S uM shot from 22 feet 
ItpPE'd the rim. 

U( SO jumped to a quick 
three point lead in the (irst 
overtime. but Cal Baptist broke 
down the tough Triton defense 
and pulled even. At the end of 
the first overtime the score wa 
71-71. 

In the econd overtime 
neither te"lm did much but hold 
the ball and try to get a good 
shot. As a result both teams 
sco red j list two poi nt . 

In the third extra period both 
teams fouled often. Douglas , 
Omalev and Brockett all fouled 
out before John Cox came in 
<.Ind hit his game winning free 

throws. As Cox hit his last 
attempt the crowd broke into a 
c.·enzy and practically stormed 
the court. A desperation shot at 
the buzzer by Cal Baptist was 
no good and the Tritons h<Jd 
their first league win. 

After the g<Jmt:! cO<Jch Burry 
Cunninghum said, " This was a 
f<Jntasti e game. I just can ' t 
believe how well <J played game 
it was. It·s a shume someone 
had to lose . We played an 
excellent te<Jm gume tonight: I 
:ure hope this continues. The 

cr<?wd really helped us too. 
Without them, who knows what 
might have happened." 

Pacing the Tritons attack 
besides Douglas and Omalev 
were Scott Knudson with II 
points, Brockett with JO points 
und II crucial rebound , and 
Cox with 9 point . Leading the 
way (or Cal Baptist was Auty 
William who scored 22 points 
and picked off a game high 12

JV Cagers Demolish Cal Baptist 
By Kev in Elliott 

In one of their best 
performances of the season, the 
UCSD Triton JV Basketball 
squad demolished an inex-
perienced Ca 1 Baptist team 124-
73 and set the tone for a very 
rowdy Spirit Night. UCSD led 
from the start and then , five 
minutes into the second haiL 
turned the game into a 
laughter. 

UCSD 'broke out fust in the 
first half und led 12-0 before the 
game wus two minutes old. 
but they could not shake Cal 
B<Jptist who stayed within 10-15 
points down the entire half. 
Thanks to Paul Gardener's 
strong offensive board play and 
Dan<J Bedard 's hot shooting 
hand , UCSD wellt into the 
locker room at h<Jiftime with a 
13-point margin, 54-41 .

How long has it been since you've 
seen a Dentist? 

By Jon Goelz 
Senior Slarr Writl'r 

Little Leaguers dream of 
playing in the Major Leagues. 
Actors aim for Broadway . And 
now the swim team thinks it too 
is ready to play with the big 
boys. 

Few are impre sed when 
coach Bill Morgan ays his 
team competes in the NAIA. 
But the NCAA is another thing 
altogether. NCAA says big time 
athletic : UCLA, Notre Dame, 
Michigan. 

So the wimmers are 
pondering a move from the 
National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics to the 

ational Collegiate Athletics 
Association. The names sound 
alike, but they stand for whole 
different world of competition. 

The UCSD swimmers. who 
compete in ... the NAIA Cham· 
pionships annually. figure on 
paper that they could pull out'a

A move to the NCAA Di\'ision 
III (their lowest rung of 
competition) would pit UCSD 
against all non-sc holarship 
squads, evening up the 
competition . Morgan figure 
his team could place fourth or 
fifth in Division III this year, if 
they decided to go. But that' 
not likely to happen, although 
they could go by simply 
notifying the NCAA that they 
want to. 

"We could go to the Division 
III championsllips this year," 
said Morgan. "But I made 
commitment to the guy in 
October that if they reached 
certain times . we would send 
them to Alabama (the site of 
the NAIA ationals)." But 
since the National qualifying 
times for the NCAA com-
petition are faster th,m the 
NAJA standurds. Morgan is 
afraid that a sudden witch 
might le ave some team 
members alienated if they 
can't qualify . 

But little doubt exi ts that the 
team will eventually join the 

CAA. "Divi ion III i our next 
logical move," said Morgan . 

" The NCAA is getting stronger 
. every year and the AlA is not 

progre sing a well ." 
"When J was a freshman in 

college," said Morgan , a 
qualifier in the 1650 free some 
seven years ago, " the Di vision I 
sWndards were slower than 
today's Divi ion III qualifying 
times." 

Besides the better compe, 
tition , moving to the NCAA 
proves superior economically 
as well. While the UCSD 
Athletic Department is picking 
up the tab for this year' trip to 
Alabama, some $2500. the 

CAA will pay travel ex pen es 
for any swimmer qualifying 
for their National Cham-
pionships. 

So there certainly won't be 
any opposition from the 
Intercoll eg iate Athletic 
De pa rtment. ., Philosoph ically. 
Division III is mo t attuned to 
the department ," said 

lntercollegi~.lte Athletic 
Di rector Judy Sweet. "As long 
as it afford our athletes a 
chance to be nationally 
competitive and is econom-

. ically feasible, I support it."

Liason, Bus Route Cuts Council Topics 
(Condn,",d om page 1) 
cutbac brought by passage of 
Proposi ion 3. 

As an dd~ plus, in the view 
of council chairman Rob 
DeKovel1 of SDSU, the new 
liaison j)b will help to involve . 
members whose schools are not 
in the city of San Diego and are 
not affected by the bus service 
cuts. 

Attendance by these non-city 
members at the Collegiate 
Council meetings has been 

spar~. 
Another liaison position, to 

the City Attorney's office, was 
proposed at Saturday ' s 
meeting in an effort to combat 
consumer fraud against 
students. 

Weisman Getting Started 
Based on her experience so 

far, Weisman suggested that 
the council go slow on the third 
office so it can concentrate on 
establishing the job with the 
Board of Supervisors. 

" What it says in my job 
description doesn 't have a 

whole lot to do with my job in 
real life. It doesn't say who to 
talk to or contact," she said, 
suggesting that the council may 
have to help whoever it picks to 
get the new office on its feet. 

"I spent the last quarter ju t 
getting started. It was a real 
learning experience. I had to 
find out the ins Olnd outs of city 
governmenr. where the best 
channels are, and so forth," she 
SClid . 

"The next two quarters I 
hope to make some headway. I 
want to make the city aware of 
what our position is , and also to 
make the students aware. 

"I think if students were 
more informed, they 'd be more 
steamed," she said. 

One of her problems this 
quarter has been to get an 
unbiased view of the con-
troversial transit i ue . After 
talking to bus company 
officials, city politicians and 
bureaucrats , and union 
officials, Weisman said she also 
ought views from observers

Saxon said ut Thur day 's 
press conference thut ulthough 
" it i di appointi ng but hurdly 
urpri ing that the Governor's 

budget does not provide the full 

level of funding requested by 
the Regent ," he did not believe 

C had been treated " punitive-
ly or even unfairly ." 

Brown. an ex-o fficio member 
of the boa rd , did not attend 
either day of the meeting , 
although he had been expected

outside the conflict, such as 
reporters. 

• Bus Cuts Discussed 
The threat of bus service 

cuts, which may involve routes 
21 and 41 here, was the second 
m<1jor issue at Saturday's 
meeting. The issue has been the 
mOlin re<1son for the Collegiate 
Council's revival this year, 
after a period of dormancy . 

The council adopted a 
definite strOltegy for action on 
the transit issue after DeKoven 
and Weisman reported their 
conclu ions in the matter. 

"There's <1 lot of state money 
tied up by legislation in the 
Metropolitan Transit Develop-
ment Board for the Tijuana 
Trolley, " DeKoven said. 

Saying that State ~nator 

James Mills and the San Diego 
City Council seem to wlu:lt the 
present transit system 
dismantled in favor of a new 
system, including the border 
trolley, DeKoven accused them 
of "sacrificing present service 
for a future system. " 

The council approved a 
resolution asking the state to 
fund und the city to reinstate 
curtailed bus service. Passing 
the resolution was the first 
step in a twelve-step plan to 
convince San Diego ,students, 
legislators and citizens oC the 
" need" to "see the buses roll 
again." 

Steps include having each 
member campus pass a similar 
resolution, sending postcards 
to Mills, writing I~lters to local 

newspapers, targeting students 
with fliers and campus 
newspapers and involving 
sympathetic local interest 
groups. 

"We need this to be done as 
Cast as possible to reOllly raise 
everyone's consciousness on 
this issue ," DeKoven said. 
"We'd like to inundate 
legislators and city councilmen 
with the number oC letters. " 

The speed events are moving

Pleasure Reading Pursued 
(ContinuecLfrom page 8) 
carry on in many respects like 
the Monty Python company. 
When I first learned that the 
Casteneda books were not 
" true" -as such, I felt very 
disappointed, but after re-
reading them, a sense oC 
understanding arises that 
soothe the wounded sense of 
trust that was taken advantage 
of in such a blatant fashion. 

o Even though Don Juan may not 
exist a a " real" man, his ideas 
and most of a ll his lifestyle a re 
very qeneficial when your 
sense of doubt and frustration 
has grown to the size of a huge 
monster guarding the gate to 
the "other world" of truth, 
peace or success, depending on 

your own orientation. 

For those of you aspiring to a 
career involving fame and 
glory , try Saul Bellow 's 
Pulitzer winner, Humboldt's 
Gift. It is essentially Bellow's 
autobiography (at least it 
appears to be) , dealing with the 
problem oC being very famous, 
mostly wealthy , in advanced 
middle-age, very lonely and 
alienated from most things, 
including a personal conception 
of self. The story jumps around 
from contemporary Chicago to 
40 years ago in New Jersey , to 
Europe, to the somewhat final 
destination of a stoic tolerance, 
living quit e simply and 
"unpretentiously" in a small 
hotel in Madloid, sleeping and 

hoping, but finally allowing the 
inevitable presence of 
" someone else" to push, steer 
and guide with energy into 
some new, perhaps different 
aspect oflife. Although the book 
borders on making the reader 
manically depressed and 
existentially nauseated (not to 
mention load ed with an 
a bundance of philosophical 
catchphrases), it somehow is 
very cheering to ee a man of 
thi nature bailing away 
through life in the same leaky 
boat we all eem to be in . It is a 
worldly book full of wisdom 
that has been gained by u very 
intelligent , sensitive man , and 
on the whole evoke the same 
sort of melancholy pleasure a 
a bottle of expen ive wine.
