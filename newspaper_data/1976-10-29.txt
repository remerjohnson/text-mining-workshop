Student Groups Host "Election 76"at UCSD

Fourth College, the Student 

Center, and the students of 
Political Science 10 guarantee you 
a " winner"on election day. 

culmination of all politlcal cam-
paigns to Building C of the 
Student Center Complex. Needless 
to say, the action takes place next 
Tuesday, Nov. 2, and runs from 5 
pm to midnight. 

The lounge will be divided into 
two sections- one side for political 
purists who wish to watch the 
proceedings with relatively little 
fanfare, and the other for those 
who want to eat, celebrate or 
"whatever. " Don't bet on your candidate 

though. 
The collaboration of the three 

groups has resulted in "Election 
76," UCSD's answer to election 
central. 

A soWKl system hookup, eight 
television sets, chalkboard tallies 
of key elections, posted predictions 
of winnen and moniton at certain 
election headquarters will bring 
the thrill of election nUzht and the 

"Even if your candidate doesn't 
come through, we don't think you'll 
go away unhappy," says Steve 
Switala of the Student Center. To 
promote this ideal, and to generate 
a "party" atmosphere, dinner will 
be available for $1.50.Polyphagous 
pains of perplexed political pundits' 
can be assauged by such epicurean 
delights as ham, roast beef, corn 
beef, potato salad, soft drinks and 
much more. 

Jenni Murray, Fourth College 
Assistant Dean, hopes the evening 
will promote both "seriousness and 
fun." She noted that such an event 
should " spur on the interest of the 
voters, promote greater political 
attention and ~enerally allow a 
good time for all. " 

Those people worrying most will 
be the students of Professor Jack 
Saloma in Political Science 10.

$6 Student· Activity Allocation : 
Questions and Countercharges Abound 

by Dorothy Houston 
Staff Writer 

At the moment there are only questions. not 
answers, that surround the $6 Campus Student 
Activity Fee allocation to student organizations. 
One side questions the guidelines that the Coop's 
Student Activ,ity Fee Support Group (SAFSG) used 
to determine budgets. The other countercharges 
that such claims attempt to undermine the Coop by 
casting SAFSG as an irresponsible body. All of this 
has led to the question of whether the SAFSG should 
be autonomous, or whether ·an agency should 
oversee its actions. 

Presently there is a controversy between the 
Coop, which has already approved student 
organization budgets for the winter and spring 
quarters, and Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs 
George Murphy, who has put a "freeze" on the 
budgets. In explaining his move Murphy said that 
he "withheld action on the winter and spring 
budgets on the advice of the Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee Programs." (reg fee committee). 

The reg fee committee, in suggesting this action, 
noted that they had not received an adequate ex-
planation of the criteria and guidelines utilized by 
the SArSG in determining student organization 
budgets. Stating that unW "certain ambiguities" 
are cleared up, the committee will probably advise 
that the funds remain frozen. ' 

Budgets for student organizations are initially 
determined by SAFSG and are then brought to the 
Coop floor for vote. After approval, the budgets are 
sent to the reg fee conunittee which recommends to 
Murphy actlona he should take concerning the 
budgets. 

The reg 'fee conunlttee meeting of October 14 
attempted to clear up the problema of deflnlng 
SAFSG procedures and the freezing of the funds. It 
was decided that the CoordInator of the SAFSG, 
then Third College Senior Montgomery Reed, 
should draw up • document speclfyinC the 

,"mechanism and procell of last year's BRG 
(SAFSG) .Doc.tion." Thill document .11 to be 
ubmitted to Rick Whitehill, Aailtant Dean of 
udent Affaln, and C»ChIlrmIn of the rei fee 

committee, and to Olear Maralo, student C»-

chainnan. 
It was stipulated that if the docwnent proved 

acceptable to the co-chairs they would recommend 
that the budgets be unfrozen. 

Reed submitted the document last week but the 
funds remained frozen. In a letter to Murphy,. 
Moreno and Whitehill stated "we must advise you 
that we feel that it would be improper to release 
budgets arrived at during spring quarter ... " 

Reasons cited for this recommendation included 
the belief that Reed's document didn't specify 
several important points. Among the complaints 
detailed were that student organizations remained 
uninformed of the mechanism for requesting 
Campus Activity Fee Support. 

At the oct. 14 reg fee committee a subcommittee 
was formed with the purpose of developing a set of 
guidelines as to the allocation of student fees. The 
subcommittee is made up of reg fee committee 
members, representatives of the Student Affairs 
Division, and SAFSG members including the new 
SAFSG coordinator Susan Karpinski. 

Murphy states that he "fully expects the sub-
committee to produce those elusive guidelines," 
and hopes that the committee will be satisfied and 
the budgets released. 

Chair of the reg fee subcommittee Bert Lee 
defined the purpose of the subcommittee as a 
mechanism for "looking into details of student 
activity fee allocations. " Lee feels that such 
problems as "fiscal discrepancies" can be 
alleviated through the subcommittee. 

Noting that the reg fee committee and Murphy 
were "overscruUnizing" the SAFSG, Lee stated 
that "they (the reg fee committee) shouldn't hold a 
bucket of water over SAFSG's head and teU them to 
shape up." According to Lee the reg fee committee 
should deal more with the question of whether the 
overall proceueI of SAFSG are fair and IOCical. A 
final important qlleltlon is the extent of ae-
countabiUty that SAFSG should be held to. Lee laYS, 
"I grant that Murphy has logical arguments 
(concerning detaUa in the processes of the SAFSG) 
but the question is whether an administrative group 
such the rec fee committee should over the 
campus activity f in such a ",id manner. " 

"They've been analyzing and 
predicting winners and per-
\.entages of congressional and 
statewide candidates around the 
country," said Saloma. "A portion 
of this grade will naturally reflect 
on their analyses, so one can 
imagine how interested they'll be 
in the results." 

Saloma detailed the " hard 
work" of the students, which ex-
tended to their telephoning and 
"probing" all over the country. As 
for their accuracy in predicting the 
"big race," Saloma said that the 
two groups covering Ford and 
Carter called it " too close to tell." Jenn; Murray 

Elections Board Votes Down 
· McElroy's Referend urn Charge 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Elections Board Wednesday voted unanimously to reject 
Chancellor McElroy's charge that they conduct a student governance 
referendum this quarter. This action came in response to an Oct. 8 letter 
from McElroy to the Elections Board in which this charge was made. 
(Triton Times Oct. 13 and 20). 

McElroy was out of town yesterday and thus unavailable for comment 
on the Board's action. 

Board members referred to their constitution in which it is specified 
that student governance referendums may only be called by either a 
student-initiated petition or one signed by three of the five UCSD student 
governmental organizations-Student Cooperative Union and the college 
councils. 

35% Turnout? 
The Elections Board is currently devising petition and hearing 

guidelines. In the event that students do generate a referendum, the 
Board is considering 35% as a minimum percentage figure of voters 
needed to legitimize an election. 

Meanwhile, the Independent Students for Democracy (ISO), a group of 
students circulating a petition calling for inclusion on the student 
governance referendum any model supported by 100 student signatures, 
are lobbying the various college councils and requesting that they show 
their support for the referendum. Peter Stone, Fourth College Elections 
Board representative and ISD member, says the gJ;ouP has offered 
themselves as an information source on the content and procedures in-
volved with the proposed referendum ballot. 

Board members hope that individual groups, such as lSD, will take the 
initiative to petition for the vote on student government. This vote was 
originally scheduled for last spring, according to the specifications of the 
two year trial agreement on Coop operations. 

Democrats Ask Students for 
Help in Local Campaigns 

Local Democratic politicians 
issued a call Wednesday for 
students to help them in the final 
week of their campaigns. _ 

" We can only win by citizen 
participation in our campaigns 
because, frankly, they (the 
Republicans) have all the bucks," 
Assemblyman Larry Kapiloff said 
on the Gym steps in a noon rally 
sponsored by UCSD Democrats 
and Progressives. 

Kapiloff was one of several 
Democratic office-seekers at the 
gathering, which drew about 100 
listeners. Also at the rally were 
76th Assembly District candidate 
Ron Kirkemo, 77th Assembly 
District candidate Tim Cohelan, 
41st Congressional District can-
didate King Golden, 43rd 
Congressional District candidate 
Pat Kelly and representatives 
from the Jimmy Carter and Yes on 
Prop. 14 campaigns. 

"Ultra-Right Wingers" 
Kapiloff, who is facing a 

vigorous challenge from Al 
Couppee in the 78th Assembly 
District, portrayed the local 
elections this year as being bet-
ween "progressives" and " ultra-
right wingers. " 

Kapiloff also spoke about the 
implications of the presidential 
contest. If Carter loses, the 
Assemblyman predicted, it will 
mean " four more years of 
(President) Ford and the biggest 
collection of white-shlrted 
hoodlums in history." 

Kelly, who is challenging in-
cumbent Clair Burgener in a 
district which includes UCSD, said 
he is rwming "because of my 
opponent's record." He said 
Burgener has a zero rating from 

Common Cause and that while in 
Congress he has consistently voted 
against education and bills that 
mean more jobs. 

IGrkemo, running against In-
cumbent Bill Craven in the 

Ron Klrkemo 
Assembly District representing 
UCSD, said "I really believe I'm 
going to win." He said his opponent 
voted against the Coastal 
Protection Bill and additionally 
sought to perpetuate the state oil 
depletion allowance. 

Kirkemo also said Craven has 
accumulated $50,000 in unused 
special interest donations during 
his first three years in the state 
Legislature. Kirkemo, who teaches 
political scienr.e at Point Lorna 
College, said t.e would return all 
unused camp.i~ n funds. 

Several of me peakers called for 
students to part cipate in the local 
Democratic get~ut-the-vote drive, 
which wiU t fY> nri iii" 
from 4 pm to 8 pm on election day. 
Th last four hours of balloting are 
considered especially crucial l 
Democratic candidates because 
many registered Democrats are 
blue collar workers who don't vote 
until they get off work in the 
evening.

The voters may be bored, but the poUtlcansaren't boring this year. 
In sharp contrast to the apathetic and cynical electorate, there are 

enough exciting elections in San Diego to keep political activists happy 
through November. There are at least four controversial elections, which 
all pit youth against age and liberal against conservative. The results of 
these contests could have a profound .effect on the future of local, and 
state politics. 

Possibly the most important election is in the 3rd Supervisorial 
District. This race, between incumbent Lou Conde and Del Mar City 
Attorney Roger Hedgecock, places environmentalists against pro-growth 
supporters. But it also has implications beyond the local considerations. 

The golden boys oj Son Diego politics? King Golden and Roger Hedgecock 
await their turns at a recent candidates' forum in La Jolla . [IT photo: Bill 
Brooks] 

The contest puts the prestige of two major California Republicans on 
the line. San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, possibly the most powerful 
moderate Republican in the state, has endorsed Hedgecock. Ronald 
Reagan, regarded by many as the titular head of the state Republican 
pa rty, is backing Conde. 

The out~ome of the election could give a good idea of the strength the 
Wilson and Reagan camps can expect in the next few years. This could be 
especially important in 1978, if Wilson decides to challenge Gov. Brown. 
The Mayor will probably be forced to run a gamut of Reaganites in the 
primary that year to get the Republican gubernatorial bid. 

000 

Two young Democrats hopeful of defeating long-time Republican 
legislators this next week are Bob Wilson and King Golden. Wilson is 
challenging 74-year old Jack Schrade, a 22-year veteran of the state 
Legislature, in the 39th state senatorial District. 

At least one local politician predicts great things for Wilson. After he 
'.'demolishes" Schrade, says Democratic heavy M. Larry Lawrence, 
Wilson could very well go on to become state Attorney General in 1978, be 
re-elected to that post in 1982 and ascend to the governorship in 1986. This 
may be an ambitious scenario, but Lawrence-who has become known as 
a "maverick" because he supported Republican Hugh Flournoy in 1974 
against Brown- can do it if anyone can. . 

However, Wilson still has to get past a well-financed Scllrade. Although 
Wilson is ahead in the polls, the race is expected to be close. 

The other Democratic hopeful is King Golden, who is running against 
Congressman Bob Wilson in the 41st Congressional District. Wilson, who 
is seeking a 13th term, should not be confused with the Democratic Bob 
Wilson ... or with Mayor Wilson for that matter. 

Golden could have a good shot at Wilson this year, if Jimmy Carter was 
doing well in the state. However, Carter is running behind in the 
California Poll. In addition, there is disagreement over whether the " coat 
tails" effect is still in force, with the current deterioration of party 
loyalties. 

Golden's best bet is to never stop running after next Tuesday's election. 
1978 would mark the third time Golden would put his name before the 
voters. By that time, he could well build up enough name identification to 
beat the popular, but aging, Wilson.

Name identification could play an important role in the 78th 

Assembly District showdown between incumbent Democrat Larry

LE II ERS TO THE IDITOR 
Fenton's Remarks Criticized.. Again ~ 

* *' * Americans Deserve More Freedom Than Latin Americansl , 
Dear Jeff: 

Let's see now - here we are in 
the U.S. of A., freeas birds to do 
or say as we please. You know, I 
could move tomorrow if I 
wanted, go to Omaha and get a 
job talking to pigs or move to 
Seattle and drive a taxi or go 
anywhere. I want and do 
anything I want and even write 
bigoted, neo-fascist tracts on 
international relations if I want. 
So what I'm wondering about, 
and I hope you can explain it to 
me, is why I can move from La 
Jolla to Fairbanks and find 

work, but a buddy of mine in the 
poor part of Guadalajara can't 
move to San Diego and find 
work? 

I realize I'm probably a litUe 
naive about all this and I'm sure 
there are perfectl)· good 
reasons why an American 
deserves more freedom than a 
Latin American but darned 'if I 
can figure out what they are. It 
seems to me, though heaven 
knows I certainly don't know 
anything, that maybe we should 
be working not on how to keep 

people from crossing the border 
but rather how we can get rid of 
the border - all borders. It Just 
seems sort of commolHlensical 
that anybody who "'sits 
America ought to have the m\De 
rights as an American. 

I surely would appreciate a 
liWe more of your clear. 
thinking on this so that I can 
know what to think myself. And 
if you could maybe tell me all 
about Proposition 14 at the 
same time I'd be grateful

Fenton Called '1ll-1nfonned", ~ 
One common by-product of 

historical change is for 
progressive ideas to lose their 
force and gradually become 
rhetorical weapons of reaction. 
An all·too obvious example of 
this process can be seen in the 
current debate over Proposition 
14. The once progressive idea 
that all people should be secure 
in their possessions against the 
claims of the absolutist state 
has, with the passage of time, 
become an empty phrase: the 
abstract "right of property" is 
today advanced by reac· 
tionaries as a justification for 
denying concrete human rights 
to an oppressed minority . 

one is denying Fenton his right 
to say what he likes about 
illegal workers. What is being 
questioned, however, is his 
"right" to have ill-informed and 
essentially racist opinions 
printed as an article in what is 
touted as "the official student 
newspaper" of Uam. The 
Triton Times routinely refuses 
to print articles with a "leftist" 
orientation, considered un-
suitable by the editorial board. 

academic debate, but nothing to 
get excited about. In fact, 
people like Pfost seem to think 
that perSonal opinions, like 
personal property, are 
somehow inviolable, and that to 
strongly attack someone's 
opinions Is to be "pe~onal" and 
hence unfair, or, to use Fenton's 
words, "s landerous" and 
"libellous. " 

Unfortunately, ideas like 
Fenton's, however confused, 
are not abstractions; they are 
widelv held in this COUlltry and 
do have an adverse effect on 
people's lives: namely the lives 
of the many workers who are 
not U.S. citizeflS. Consequently 
it is important to expose and to A similar transformation is 

clearly demonstrated in the 
Oct. 25 issue of the Triton 
Times. The right of free speech, 
a concept to which most of us at 
least attach a positive value, is 
used by Jeff Fenton and (im-
plicitly) by Mary Pfost and the 
editorial cartoo$t, to shield 
reactionary opinion from 
criticism! 

A more disturbing issue than 
the Triton Times' conservati~ 
bias is, however, raised by the 
"Fenton case." There seems to 
be a widespread assumption at 
UCSD that ideas and opinions 
are merely abstractions with no 
connection to the real world; 
perhaps the material for a good Continued on Page 6 

Fenton Uses Dehumanizing T ~ 

In reality, of course, property 
is not at issue in Proposition 14. 
Likewise, the right of free 
speech is not reaUy at issue in 
the "Fenton controversy." No 

If Fenton had wanted to In-
telligenUy discuss U.S. im-
migration policy he would not 
have used such intrinsically 
dehumanizipg tenns to refer to 
the hwnan bein.iS in question. 
The accuracy of the historical 
analogy is attested to by Fen-
ton 's plaintive yelps in Mon-
day's TT, and I for one shall not 

waste any more time on his 
modest proposal for Festuag

M.ELCAN 

Cauws Answers TI, Schneider 
The Marxist Caucus of the UCSD Student 

Cooperative Union would like to take this time to 
respond to what we believe to be inaccurate 
statements made by misguided liberals within the 
Coop and the TritonTimes. We are specifically 
responding to the "red threat" charges made by 
Andy Schneider to one of the less responsible 
members of the Triton Times, Mark Stadler. Th~ 
charges appeared in an article (TT, Oct. 22) entiUed • 
"Schneider: 'SomeOne to Stand Up to Coop Fac· 
tions'." 

The first 'charge made by Schneider in the article 
is that the Marxist Caucus "played a decisive role in 
denying Schneider a new term as External Affairs 
coordinator." To this, we respond: 

1 ) The Marxist Caucus made and executed a 
collective decision to abstain from aU proposed 
coordinators that were not members of the Caucus. 
There were on that night six different elections to 
support groups, and the Marxist Caucus was 
dissatisfied with the majority of the candidates. Bee 
and Schneider were no exception. 

2) The voting results as recorded in the minutes 
were the foUowing: 

a) On the first vote, between Bee and Schneider, 
there were 17 votes cast for Bee 14 for Schneider 
and 13 abstentions. ' , 

b) On the second vote, a vote of confidence for 
Bee, there were 18 votes of confidence 12 no votes of 
confidence, and 12 abstentions. ' 

The numerical strength of the Caucus at that 
meeting was eight people. Examination of these two 
votes reveals that, unless the voting behavior 
changed dramatically, which is unlikely, the 
majority of no votes of confidence in Bee came from 
the same people that voted for Schneider in the ffrst 
vote. It was, in fact, the Schneider caucus that 
prevented the clear winner, Ron Bee, from 
receiving the approval of the body. Ttws, It Is clear 
that the "factions" in the Coop are within the Ubera! 
camp itself; Bee's supporten on the one hand, and . 
Schneider's on the other. It laabeolutely untrue that 
the eight votes of the Caucus in abstention worked to 
"deny Schneider a new term." 

3) Abstention doe. not equal prevention. The 
Marxist Caucus was simply reflecting our no. 
,support of the proposed candidates tIirougb ab-
stention. 

Next, the charge was made by Schneider that the 

issue (the "Crux of the conflict") was the abolition 
of the SBPC, which both Bee and Schneider refused 
to endorse. To this we respond: 

1) This is an outright lie. The issue is not, and 
never has been, abolition of SBPC. This was not 
even discussed at the meeting. . 

2) It is also a lie that members of the CaucWl 
advocate the aboUtion of SBPC. In January of this 
year, a former UCSD representative to SBPC 
Marco LiMandri, released a report critiCizing t~ 
SBPC and offering a proposal for its reltnldue. 
The report . included a strategy to accomplish this 
reformation. As Marxista, the Caucus feels it our 
duty to constructively critique, and not destruc-
tively condemn, structures such as SBPC. Mr. 
Schneidt;r does not seem to realize this, although he 
is aware of the refonnation report. Or maybe he 
chose not to mention this fact. (Copies of the report 
are available in the Student Organizations office of 
the Student Center.) 

The third charge made by Schneider was that "a 
move to abolish the Council will destroy everything 
San Diego has worked to achieve." The Marxist 
Caucus is not clear on what everything is that San 
Diego has worked to achieve. We assume that the 
most fundamental thing has been the lobbying for 
Third College Step II. If this is the case, why did 
Schneider tell a member of the Caucus last Wed· 
nesday that he could do the same work for ThIrd 
College outside of SBPe? Who exacUy Is Schneider 
working for, San Diego, Third College. or Andy 
Schneider? . 

The truly classic liberal slander made by 
Schneider was that "members of 1I\e Marxist 
Caucus are working to the detriment rio tile Coop" 
and that "Caucus members are trying to \lie tbe 
Coop as a platform for a single viewpoint". He adds 
that the Caucus Is "an elite 8"".IP of raclicall". 

The Caucus would like to. ~nk Schneider for 
finally bringing home the real iaiiue, that of ellUsm. 
The CauCWI believes that tile II stude .. 01 SBPC 
that speak for 100,Il00 UC Ituderita are tbe elite. The 
Caucua believes that traipeinc aboat tbt Itate for

Caucus ••• MORE ClAssiFiEds. ". 
The Caucus believes that a group 
of students objectively acting in 
the interests of the monied class in 
California and using the Council as 
a ladder for persona I gain is In-
dividual opportunism. All these 
actions are historically and con-
temporally practiced by the 
members of the SBPC. 

Schneider's statement con-
cerning eight people using the Coop 
as a platform for their ideology is 
an endorsement of the famous 
"sheep" theory. This theory, used 
historically by administrators, 
explains the student _movement 
and student rebellion as the work 
of a few crazies who everyone eise 
foUows about with no more con-
sciousness than a herd of sheep. 
Schneider seriously overstates the 
extent of our power and influence. 
UCSD has more white radical 
students in action than any other 
UC. To define the participants in a 
mass organization such as the 
Coop as being used by a group of 
radicals does great injustice both 
in the Cooperative as a form of 
govenunent and to the students in 
attendance. 'Indeed, if Schneider 
believes students will passively 
accept these red-baiting 
statements, then he must indeed 
think that students are less con-
scious than sheep. 

We would like to thank Schneider 
and Mark Stadler (who was smart 
enough not to put his name to the 
article) for bringing the existence 
of the Marxist Caucus to the UCSD 
community's attention. It is our 
desire to seize the time and the 
opportunity to reveal the truth 
behind the slanted 1"1' article. The 
reader must ask what Schneider's, 
and the TT's, motives are for 
printing just lies on the front page 
of the paper. We must all ask why 
Stadler wrote an article on a 
meeting he did not even attend. 
The reasons are clear to the 
Caucus. However, regardless of 

the~ irresponsible rantings and 
ravmgs, we strongly urge strong 
student support for the 
Cooperative Union, and will 
continue to support constructive 
criticism of this continuing ex-
(nriment in student government.

"Carwash": SudSy 
by Sara Lowen 

and Margaret Hewey 
Hey baby, put yourseU in the mood 

for this review: flip on the radio, and 
turn that dial to your favorite disco 
station. Now, if your groovin' to the 
disco sound, you're in the mood for 
'''Carwash,'' a recent Universal Studios 
release, directed by Michael Schultz. 

"Carwash" is American Graf-
fitti/Nashville with a disco beat, set at 
the Dee-Luxe carwash in Southern 
California. The movie, a series of 
vignettes about the carwash workers, 
takes you through a day of splishin', 
splashin' and boogyin' . Floyd and Uoyd 
man the sprays, Hippo lathers it up, 
Lindy does the waxing and polishing, 
T.C. 'the Fly' shines it on, and Marsha 
totals up your bill. 

The guys at the carwash do manage 
to wash a few cars, when they aren't 

playing jOkes on each other. 
pranks center arourid toilet 
peeping through the bathroom 
at Marsha, putting hot sauce in 
burrito, running the boss's son 
the sprayers, and putting dog 
the boss's car. It's all in a day's 
the carwasb. -

In short, the film's humor is 
but sidesplitting. The UULnl~:eU'JlI 
of the carwash wnrk!'1'lI 
they make you feel im!sPl~nsiibl 
gooood! It's a gut feeling, 
beautiful. 

Big name stars like Richard 
George Carlin and the Pointer 
add to the film's unique brand of 
with their cameo performances. 

Pryor is great as Daddy 
shafts his brothers with a grin 
face and a smile in his heart. 
vious Reverend Ike take-off, 
portrayed as a high class pimp, 
out in snappy threads. 
chauffeured fortress on 
as a spiffy entourage of 
sing in, 'You Got to 
Something.' The Pointer 
really in their element belting 
routine. 

Carlin's part as a seedy 
wasn't bigger, for he handled 
well. 

But it's the talented cast of 
who really carry " 
comedic success.

Mli 'vrnn, Marsha's prayers for a real 

are answered in the fonn of KeMY 
Thomerson) a real life Arrow 
man who happens by the car-

and sweeps her off her feet. 
Rich Brestoff scores points as Irwin, 

the boss's son, the textbook 
revolutionary who insists on getting 
down with "the people" on the carwash 
line. But the workers don't buy Irwin's 
Chainnan Mao line and have alitUe fun 
with him, putting him through the 
carwash. 

And the cats that work the line husUe 
their way to stardom. Franklin Ajaye is 
right on as T.C. 'the fly' who whiles 
away his time in his funky fly t-shirt, in 
time to boogie rhytluns and hassling 
over phone calls to an AM radio station 
ror free concert tickets-aU this to score 
with a sexy chick named Mona, a 
waitress with low-rent class. . 

Darrell Igus and DeWayne Jessie 
played the parts of Floyd and Lloyd, 
aspiring Spinners, with rea\. soul. 
Anton io Fargas as Lindy, the funky, 
smartass Geraldine Jones delivered 
such memorable lines as: "I'm more 
man than you'll ever be and more 
Woman than you'U ever get," with 
style. 

A highlight of the film is Professor 
Irwin Corey's role as Professor Irwin 
Corey. The scene where T.C. and Hippo 
mistake his urine specimen for a bomb 
is a real comedy classic. 

So now that you're in the mood and 
reelin' good, boogie on down to your 
local theatre and see "Carwash."

Please Mr., please. Somebody 
has to help me save Olivia Newton-
John before she becomes a middle-
aged muzak mac hine. 

It may be too late already to save 
her from the writers and producers 
who 've been giving her non-
descript shit to record. But for 
God's sake stop those cretins from 
Nashville from turning her into a 
Loretta Lynn or Tanu:ny Wynette. 

It was just a few years ago when 
Olivia Newton-John was the top 
se\ling fema le vocalist anywhere. 
She progressed from "Let Me Be 
There" to "If You Love Me (Let 
Me Know)" to "Have You Never 
Been Mellow." She went to the 
Grammy Awards one night and 
needed a U·haul to take home all 
the plastic statuettes she won. I'll 
never forget that touching moment 

triton time8 

To 
Station 

Olivia Newton ·John 

on the Johnny Carson show when she sang "I Honestly Love You," 
replete with genuine tears at the finale. She was a lovely young pop singer 
with a healthy dose of hit singles under the belt. The world was at her feet. 
It was then that Tbey made the decision that was to irrevocably change 
the lady from Down Under. 

"Go to Vegas, Olivia" They ordered. "Follow the path of Tony Orlando 
and Dawn, Helen Reddy and all the other faded pop stars. Appeal to those 
middle-aged capitalist pigs! Take the easy way out." like the sweet 
person she is, Olivia did what she was told. And she doesn't even like the 
place . 

The switch was now complete. Her albums Clearly Love and Come On 
Over were devoid of those catchy hit singles. They contained a lot of 
sweet.sounding dirge as well as plenty of rehaShed, unoriginal material. 
But They told her she didn't need more hit singles. After all, she could 
only sing for ninety minutes on stage at Vegas. Olivia aJRady had more 
than enough hits to sing on stage at the Riviera Hote\. 

And then •. horror of all horrors, They decide that she can sell records on 
the Country Western circuit as well. That sounds logical, right? After all, 
Nashville is overrun with attractive singers from Australia and England. 
Shit, Tanya Tucker sounds as English as Johnny Cash. God damn it, 
Olivia, put your foot down! You don't baveto do it. 

As an old Olivia Newton-John fan , I was mildly disappointed at her 
decision to play Vegas, because I realized that things would be different 
from then on. But I still enjoyed her show. The magic wasn't as obvious, 
but she sti1\ had it. Now I'm not so sure. 

Radio disc Jockeys refer to her as Fig Newton. You can hardly blame 
them. The only thing progressive about Olivia Newton-JoM is the photos 
on her album covers, which are getting progressively better. Those stil\s 
of this }oveJylady will continue to sell her albums. Her latest album Don't 
Stop BeUevln', with a few exceptions, is plastic C&W material (record~ 
in Nashvi1\e). I haven't stopped believing, but my loyalty is reaching it's 
bounds.

Kapiloff and Republican 
newcomer AI Couppee. Kapiloff 
won't have the traditional in-
cumbent 's name ID advantage 
agaimt Couppee, who served as 
San Diego's Mr. Sports in the 
sixties. 

Couppee has been handling his 
campaign weU, especially for an 
avowed non-polltician. Most ef-
fective has been a commercial 
which features both Reagan-who 
endorses Couppee-and the can-
didate himself. While most can-
dida tes use experienced an-
nouncers to do their commercials, 
Couppee wisely uses his own voice,

Fenton ... 
challenge the ignorance and 
racist attitudes which Wlderlle 
them. 

Jeff Fenton's ideas about 
" illegals" are racist. 
(SignificanUy, he didn't at-
tempt to defend them in his 
letter of Oct. 25). Whether that 
racism is conscious or un-
conscious, whether Fenton is 
malevolent as well as misin-
formed, is of secondary im-
portance. Like the writers of the 
earlier critical letters, I am 
attacking his ideas, not his 
person. If that constitutes an 
abrogation of his rights, then 
those "rights" are not worth 
defending.

PE Unes Shrinking 1 
-Those incredible PE registration lines may be getting shorter. . 

-U~D's intercollegiate sports prOf(ram is "ahead of ita time." 
-Bad news is predicted for the athletic programs of most colleges in the 

nation. 
-All PE classes will probably be worth unit credit sometime in the 

foreseea ble future. 
All of that infonnation comes from Howard Hunt, the head of UCSD's 

PE department. Hunt, UCSD's first and only athletic director until a 
year-and-a-half ago, is certainly in a position to know. 

We are investigating alternate 
ways to register students for PE 
classes," Hunt said last week. "We 
are looking at UC Davis' pre-
registration system, and we also 
are thinking about forming PE 
lines all around the area near the 
gym, so the lines won't merge 
together as they do now." 

Hunt is hopeful that a new 
system can be put into effect by 
winter quarter sign-up time. He 
acknowledged that due to const~t 
increases in numbers who turn out 
to register, the current " get-uJ>'at-
3 am -and-wait" method "is not 
really acceptable." 

Record numbers in tennis (306), 
dance (211), swimming and other 
aquatics (24&) and volleyball (170) 

Howard Hunt were placed into classes this 
quarter. 

Hunt said that the UCSD intercollegiate program, which funds more 
teams than any other school in the nation, " is well ahead of it's time. We 
are able to keep a competitive program with a high percentage of par-
ticipants, without scholarships or recruiting. This is due mainly to the 
fact that we don't have to support a higlH!ost football team." 

In its history, UCSD has had three national championship teams, one 
each in men's volleyball, surfing and karate. 

"Within eight to ten years, I would predict that there will be about 18 
super football schools, while the rest will either have to drop their 
programs or go totally non-scholarship. There is no way, for most 
schools, that the increased cost of maintaining a team can be matched by 
increased ticket sales." 

In answer to a IT editorial calling for a uniform unit credit policy for 
PE classes, Hunt said that it is probable that within six years, classes will 
be receiving a base of 1/2 unit. 

"We are working with the Provosts with the hope that 1/2 unit for each 
class could be applied to graduation. Classes with more sophistication 
could conceivably be worth more." 

UCSD's first Athlete of the Month will be announced next week, with an 
award coming from Fidelity Union Life Insurance' College Master 
program. As of early this week, the prime candidates were water polo's 
Corky Hull and Bob Alei and soccer's Allen Cox and Alfonso Gonzales ... 

If you have never lived in the Los Angeles area, you might have missed 
hearing Laker basketball broadcaster Chick Hearn, the often-annoying 
master of the overstatement. 

John Hall 's LA Times column yesterday noted: " Chick Hearn, two 
minutes into the first Laker telecast of the young season, mentioning 
coach Jerry West and little-known aides Stan Albeck and Jack 
McCloskey : 'There's never been a more popular coaching staff in any 
sport.' If only the club could hit peak stride so quickly swiftly."

Women's V'ball ~ 
Overpowers 
Grossmont 

by Dave Cohen 
SaaffWriRr 

In what turned out to be a hotly 
contested match, UCSD's women's 
volleyball team def~ated a tough 
Grossmont squad, 15-0, 11-15, 15-10 
at the U~D gym Wednesday. 

The Tritons came out relaxed, 
poised and overpowering to blitz 
Grossmont 1~ in what looked like 
target practice for front-liner 
Andrea &ylen. Beylen continually 
fired spikes which were either out 
of the opponents' reach or simply 
too hot to handle. The defense was 
equally superb" Sparked by 
brilliant blocks by Eva Ljllllgwe, 
the defense refused to yield a 
single PQint in the one-sided game. 
When Grossmont's offense, which 
couldn't get on track, did come up 
with a good set and spike, the 
Triton defense came up with the 
save. 

In the second game it looked as if 
the teams had switched unifonns. 
The Grossmont front line took 
over, turning in blocks and spikes 
to run the score to 9-4 Grossmont. 
UCSD began to play con-
servatively, discarding the 
aggressive attack they showed in 
the first game. Where their serves 
were blistering weapons of offense 
in the first game, they became lobs 
just hoping to make it over the net 
in the second. Grossmont took 
command and held it to win, 15-11. 

In the third and deciding game, 
the Tritons were a bit more 
relaxed. The brilliant play of the 
first game showed itself again. Led 
by the excellent serves of Gigi 
Pabst a'nd fine setting by Holly 
Stewart, the front line took over 

Eva Ljungwe 

and UCSD, although Grossmont 
held tough, managed to take the 
game and the match, 15-10. 

The Tritons now stand at 7-1 and 
may be on their way to a title. As 
far as copping the crown goes, 
Coach Millenbah says, "That's 
being optimistic." Then, recon-
sidering - " We should."
