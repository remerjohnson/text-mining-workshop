Women's Studies 
Major One Step 
From Approval 
By Dan Gebler 
Guardian Reporter 

After more than four years of planning, 
Women's Studies has been approved as an 
undergraduate major at ucsn by the 
Academic Senate's Committee on Educa-
tional Policy (CEP). 

'The proposal must now await final 
approval by the Academic Senate, which 
will not meet until Nov. 26. 

The proposal, constructed by faculty 
and staff members involved with the 
Women's Studies Program, was passed 
by the CEP on Oct. 21. If approv¢ by the 
Academic Senate, as proponents of the 
proposal are confident will happen, stu-
dents will be able to declare the major in 
the fall of 1992.

the perfect jack 0' lantern can be more difficult than deciding on your classes for next quarter. No 
least this girl doesn't have to T-REG with ISIS yet. 

The original proposal for the creation 
of a Women's Studies major was con-
structed last May. After being submitted 
to the CEP and receiving additional sug-
gestions from CEP Chair Douglas Smith, 
the proposal was revised by Professors 
Valerie Hartouni, Beth Holmgren,

COMMENTARY 

• The recent decision to evict the TGs from the Price Center is the latest 
in a string of damaging blows to the unique UCSD tradition 

By ErIc Sct.mldt 
Senior SfBff Writer 

Everyone knows it's impossible to argue with morality - or ... 
administrator's policy decision. 

Vice ChanceUor of Undergraduate Affairs Joseph Watson c1auified 
the TGs as a policy issue earlier this quarter, signaling the impossitoil· 
ity of debate or appeal. Many A.S. represtntatives decided Ihc TGs 
were headed for the chopping block. 

Because Watson's policy would not allow the service of free 
alcohol in a central area of UCSD, the TGs will 
have to move again, this time from the Price Center 
to Pryatel Field near the Warren apartments. 

TGs in the central areas of CatJ1>US are inconsis-
tent with campus alcohol and drug abuse preven· 
tion policy, Watson reasoned. In central campus 
areas, the argument goes, TGs promote an image 
inconsistent with university policy, but on the 
outskirts, they can do little harm. 

"The image [of the TGs] should be that you can 
have a good time without alcohol." Watson said. 

The W1CXpected decision left A.S. members 
stunned. During the meeting with Watson, AS. 
President Agustin Orozco had wamed to propose a 
plan to bring TGs back to their traditional location 
at the Hump in front of the Main Gym. 

Instead, Orozco was compelled to relocate them 
to an area considered less suitable for the TGs. 

Fonner AS. Cormnissioner of Prognanmina 
Man Schourer contends that no UCSD student 
would take the initiative to travel to such peripheral 
events, even for 30 free ounces of beer. 

"It would take free money" to get students to 
distant TGs, he said. IsoIaled IIId empty, the TGs 
would flail about.for a while before dying out by 
!be end of !be 'Ie., Schnuru predicted. 

But !be death knell for TGs was sounded last ye8l'. 
At least. that's what many swdents thouaht after the stale 

AJcoholic Bevmse Control made Ihc TGs illegal midway 
through winter quarter. 

The ABC decided that, if underaJe SIIIdenIs are present at the 
TGs. Ihc events would have to be completely closed off to 
everyone except UCSD students, faculty, and staff. Their 
decision coincided with a California law stilling that 0rganiza-
tions can OIIly serve alc:ohol in the presence of minors when its 
events are closed to !be general public. 

The Hump could not be sufficiently fenced off to prevent 
OUISiders from attending, OCSD Police Qlief John 
Anderson decided. The TGs had to move. 

After 15 years of legally handinl out free 

cups of beer during the Friday music events, the TGs were arbitrarily 
cancelled until the A.s. could come up with another plan. 

The TGs -!be only on~ social event which had brought 
students of all cluses together - were moved from Ihcir traditional 
location at the Hump to Ihc relatively sterile Price Center. 

In the opinion of many A.S. representatives, the move would kill 
the TGs, since nobody would bodler going to the Price Center. To 
have them at the Hump without alcohol, though. would have 
mangled them as wall 

For 10 inIerim of several months, TGs were held on Ihc Hump 
with no alcohol and bdween 25 to 100 students 
in auendance. At Ihc cast of over $2..soo per 
event, the AS. spent at least $25 to SIOOof 
student money for every student at the dry TGs. 

The predictions were coming true - the only 
unifying tradition of UCSD was dying. 

But the first akohom: TG at the Price Center 
shot tboae pedictions down as students showed 
up in fOrce to consume beer and hear the bands.

LEITERS TO THE EDITOR 

student reaction with widespread support at 
UCSD is about as likely as a resurfacing of 
debate on !be RlMAC issue. It will not 
happen. 

Last ye8l', little resistance was offered 
apinst the illegality decision, besides the 
efforts of Edson. At one ro, a student 
yelled semi·intelligibly, "FucIc John 
Anderson." That hostile, hannful and 
useless speech was all the protest students 
could muster. 

In addition, less than one in 10 students 
voted in lasI year's student elections. That 
turnout hardly provides the mandate 
requiml for an effective student govern-
menl 

The argwnents for !be continuation of 
TGs in the Price Center are strong. TGs 
held in fields would add an extra $2,000 
cost per event to the already elevated 
$4,000 needed to keep all non-students 
from attending the TGs. 

The cost for added security to keep them 
legal and amenities for band members will 
come from a mysterious fund available to 
Watson which can apparently support the 
additional $20,000 in expenses this year. 

Also, the idea of selVice of only 30 
ounces of free beer to students age 21 and 
over doesn't seem to be much of a policy 
issue, particularly in light of the upcoming 
rowdy Halloween weekend at UC Santa 
Barbara. At UCSB, the TGs would be a 
non-issue. 

Beer is now served legally in the Price 
Center without the TOs - at the adminis-
tration-backed BuU's Eye Tavern. 

Watson brings up a good point in that 
alcohol shouldn't necessarily be required to 
bring students together at a successful 
social event. 

As last year's dry TGs proved, though, 
alcohol is an integral part of the TGs' 
success. In any case, the alcohol decision is 
one best left up to the AS., not administra-
tors. After all, the TGs are a IS-year 
tradition - the only real social tradition at 
UCSD. 'They have become a source of 
pride, or at least entertainment, for many 
students. 

'The tradition will clearly end without 
alcohol. Schnurer said "a TG without 
alcohol is just another concert," and he 
should know. This year's incoming 
freshmen were in the seventh grade during 
his first year here. 

As it stands, the administrative decision 
is immutable. It's just not possible to argue 
with policy - unless the students show 
widespread support for a policy of their 
own, an unlikely occum:nce in the inactive

think his alarmed reasoning about the need to 
rename the ~ Cafe is slightly off the mark. 

The problem is not that 9'Barr defines the 
word "c~" as a means to attract someone's 
attention. In fact. "c~" - an argentinism 
from guaran( which means "amigo" - is 
used as a friendly way to address an interlocu· 
tor.

my friends and family to send me the first

My c:entraI discomfort with the c0mmen-
tary is that, as mindful professors often like to 
exclaim, "it misses the poinl" 

Without getting into the history of the ~ 
CaU, it is fair to say that the name alludes to 
ideas of social revolution. guenilla insur-
gency and socialism I'8lher than 10 culinary 

correctness. The origins are probably located 
in times when many people around the world 
viewed "Ch6" Guevara as a symbol of politi-
cal change, not as a model of eating habits. 

His beret, not his paladar, his slovenly 
~ not his cholesterol level, were signs 
recognized worldwide. "Ole" the icon re-
ferred 10 an inspimtional model for public 
action, not for private vices (i.e. camivorism). 

Instead of "Shiny Whining People Eating 
Twigs" or, "Nescience Recycling Center," 
perhaps O'Barr would prefer to rename the 
Ole! Cafe "Adolph Cafe," given the known 
vegetarian eating habits of the Nazi dictator? 
As you can see, there is not necessarily a 
com:lation between political attitudes and 
dietary habits. 

o 'Barr, don't wony about the name of the 
0Je Caf~. No one will mistake you for "a 
vegetarian or a communist sympathizer." By 
the way, I know a good Argentine restaurant

Who we are: 
Student run cooperatives that have existed in the Student Center as register~ student . 
organizations, (since before there was a Price Center) for over ten years. 
What our PU[J)Ose is: 
To reduce the cost of living for the students and the UCSD community by providing 
products of a general as well as alternative nature while setting examples of not-for-
profit, cooperatively run businesses that care about the waste they produce, and 
which don't exploit workers or consumers. Students in effect "own" the business, and' 
consumers are students and other community members not unlike co-op members. 
What we would. like understood; 
Because of our commitment to educating the campus community about our dem~ 
cratic organizations while offering quality goods at the lowest possible priCes, we. 
would like everyone to understand that the loss of money due to breakage, spoilage, 
theft, etc. can. potentially .hurt the individual co-op, the campus cooperative move-
ment, and everyone who benefits from shopping at the C(H)ps. As members of the co-
ops we learn to do our best to limit the loss of money. This can be difficult, especially 
when dealing with the issue of theft. The success of our work requires everyone's un-
derstanding of who we are and what our purpose is. Everyone's input and participa-
tion is welcome. Please feel free to voice your constructive criticism and to ask how 
you can become involved.

The recession has hit student-

Alex Hartofthebusinessdepartmenl 
at Harvard's newspaper. The 
Crimson. has noticed the effects of 
the recession on the east C08SI as 
weU. although the newspaper has 
not been affected. 

"I've had smaIJ businessowners 
say. 'I would have bought an ad last 
year. but I can't afford il now with 
the recession,'" Han said. 

Ooser to home. southem Cali-
fornia student papers are also feel-
ing the effects of !he recession. 

In" An Open Letter 10 !he SDSU

fornia Slate University (CSU) 
SacramenIO 'sSlQIt Homet was also 
forced to cut its page count due 10 
the recession.. 

And, according 10 Hendrie. CSU 
Los Angeles' newspaper. 1M Uni-
vrrs;ty Timu. reduced ill publica-
tion frequency from three times a 
week 10 two times a week. 

Similarly. the GlllUdian was 
forced to switch from a thrice-
weeItIy to a ~weekly publica-
tion after a $60.000 loss lat year. 

Guardian Editor in QIief Jason 
Sneu said. "It is hard to teU if the 
GuardUm has been affcctrd by the 
recession so far this year because of 
the switch 10 the two times a week 
publication fonnal. My impression 
is that we're doing better IIwlIast

Now, he added, the newspaper is 
more "financially conscious." 

For instance. he said that staff 
members are being aslted to be more 
aware of telephone costs. 

FurIhcnnore. according to sneU. 
!he responsibility of recording the 
munber of work hours has been 
handed over to Business Manaaer

believes that UCSD has the imase 
of a new, up-anIk:omina school 
while SDSU is an older school. 
According to Snell. this might be 
one possible reaon why advertisers 
see UCSD as a I11Cft amactive c0n-
sumer market. 

However,GlltUdianAdvertising 
Manager Mike Foulks is not as 0p-
timistic. "Reality wiD set in soon, " 
he said. "'The fusl and second issues

worsens. 

"I'm going todoeverything I can 
to prevent it But, I wouldn'l be

Despite the anticipated financial

predict drastic budget cuts.

SPORTS 
The UCSD Guardian Thunday, October 31, 1991 

season 144-1 after 5-0 
shutout of Pomona-
Pitzer; regional berth to 
be decided this weekend 
By Andy Gayton 
Senior Staff Writer 

Last season, the Pomona-Pitzer 
Sagehens came out againsl the 
UCSD men's soccerieam like fight-
ing roosters - all claws and talons. 
They lost 1-0, but it was an honor-
able defeat. 

Monday afternoon brought the 
Sagehens. back to San Diego, only 
this time they had no fight left in 
them: Pomona put its heads on the 
chopping block and UCSD glee-
fully swung the IL'(e in a 5-0 shutout 
that ended the Tritons' season and 
the Sagehens' dignity. 

The win topped off a 14-4-1 sea-
son for the Triton - one that con-
tained everything from a stalled be-
giMing to a frenzieQ comeback at 
the end. 

The only thing still left unknown 
is whether or not UCSD will make 
it to the Regionals. "Now we sit and 
wail," said Head Coach Derek 
Annstrong. "This weekend. and tra-
ditionally Sunday night, is when we 
gel the call." 

While they are waiting for too 
yea or nay, the Tritons will continue 
to drill and practice. 

UCSD didn't need any practice, 
however, to defeat the headless 
Sagehens. Pomona-Pitzer Head 

Jed Brlntzenhoff and the rest of the bench played most of the second half, after UCSD opened a 4-0 lead. See M. SOCCER, Page 10

That was the case Wednesday as 
the Tritons traveled to San Diego 
Stare to play the Division I Aztecs, 
who apparently do double duty as 
the track team. The game matched 
two potent offenses that canceled 
each other out, and the game ended 
in a 1-1 stalemate. 

The pne's first few minutes 
wen: an offensive showcase, as the 
teams raced up and down the field, 
bIIIdina for conuoI. UCSD wasted 
lilde time in scoring - the aoaI

than. We were trying to play too 
much fmesse," he said. 

After a halftime talk, UCSD 
opened up the offensive attack, l» 
coming more aggressiveandspend-
ina most of the time in the SDSU 
halfofthe field. Despiteconttolling 
the ball, UCSD stiD couldn't break 
through the Aztec defense. 

As regulation came to a close. 
the game had begun to swing back 
in favor of SDSU. But the AzIccs 
could do nO more than the Tritons, 
and the game went into overtime. 

1be extra periods were just a 
minor image of regulation time,the 
game swinging back and forth until 
the final minutes of the second pe-
riod. By that time UCSD had estab-
lished control and mounted several 
threats, each fall ing short. 

"Wehadafewmomemsofweak-
ness, but we pulled together al the 
end, and played a lot beuer," Eddy 
said. "We expected it to be real 
tough, but wesrayed with them most 
of the time." 

McManus was pl~ with his

HIIper's peplllk fired up UCSD 
for me remainder of me game. ~

HiJhWders' one. Gary SeeIbona 
sc:ored twice for UCSD, and Man: 
GiulilDOPi, Reid ConInt. AwJy 
.Steinheimer, and.Brown all added 
one apiece to seal me victory. 

On an evening in which pis 
piled up on only one side of the 
scoreboard, ODe of the more excil-
ina IDOI1IeIMS came in the fourth 
period. After Brown scon:d his third 
aoal of the night - continuin& to 
add to his rccotd for ID06t career 
goals at UCSD - he was ejected 
from the game for punching Willie 
Uaurado. 

Harper said rhat Brown had been 
getting pushed around aU night. 
Apparently, Brown had had enough. 
Uaurado was also ejected in the 
oonfiolilation.althoughllOlfortigm-
in&- The ejection was his third of the 
pme. 

"Turtle's a sman player. He 
wouldn't do thai in a big game," 
Harper said after the contest

After the game, Harper com-
maJled 00 the Tritons' lack of in-
tensity: "It was a lacklusler

'Ibal's easy 10 understand if you 
consider that this is the third time 
Ibis year Ibal UCSD baa bearen up 
on Riverside pretty badly. 

"'It WIll never in question thaa we 
would win the game," Harper said. 

Harper was also pleased with the 
six of eip man-up opportunities . 
dw UCSD convened. 

"Not bad for six-on-five, six of 
eight [converted]," Harper said. 

Harper was also impressed by 
the Tritons' play in the set offense 
and off the trmsition game. 

"Good play out of the strike 
zone ... and pretty sound counterat-
tacks. .. Harper said 

UCSD will probably see the 
Highlanders again at the WWPA 
tournament in mid-November, 
where the Tritons areexpected 10 be 
the lOp seed. Harper said thaa UCR 
would probably be the fourth seed 

The Tritons, ranked ninth in the

Hl HIATUS 

By Scott 0Um0t0 
Guardian Repofter 

Critics have used the words 
"invigorating," "riveting," and 
"audacious," to describe John 
Sayles' new film, "City of Hope." 
1be only way to tru1y appreciate 
the mastery of the film is to go 
and see it for yourself. 

1beRlis nothingconventiona1 
about this movie. 1be opening 
credits andc10sing shots will bum 
themselves into the memory of 
any viewer. Packed with c0n-
vincing perfonnances and cin-
ematography of a unique style, 
"City of Hope" offers an inside 
look at the social and political 
sbUcture of a big city. 

There are several stories cen-
tered around various incidents in 
cenain neighborhoods. having 
to do with some 36 characters. 
Ifouy and name all ofthesignifi-
cant characters in the movie 
would be silly. 

The overlap in the characters , 
stories makes for scenes which 
show dialogue between one 
group of people in a restaurant 
and then move across the room 

to another group - there is no 
cuI in between the two. 1be 1arge 
metropolis of the ficticous 
Hudson City seems small and 
intimale as a ~t of Sayles' 
technique. 

Joe Morton plays Wynn, a 
black city councilman trying des-
perately to unite his district, one 
of the pooresI in the city, so it can 
work pr&:eably to gain beuer 
work conditions. His position in 
the world of the "white OWl" 
causes lIWly ofhis own pcopleto 
nun apinst him as they tum to 
the teachings of Malcom X. 

Vincent Spano plays NiCk. a 
young man who swggles to gain 
his own identity outside of his 
father's powerful influence. His 
friends are harmless goofball 
dreamers, and they come from 
the wrong side of town. 

Wynn and Nick represent the 
hope of change in a seemingly 
unchangeable way oflife. Wynn 
sees possibilities of beber living 
and more power for his confused 
district, and Nick represents the 
culture facing up to the responsi-

By JoMph GarcIa 
Hiatus Editor 

What is punk rock? Is it big 
mohawks or a shaved head? Is it 
knee-high combat boots or bondage 
pants? Tahoos and pierced ears or 
some weird make-up? It could be all 
of these or it could be none oflhem. 
If you have ever been to a punk 
show you can ahest to the incredibly 
high amount of energy1n the air. No 
maher what the people are wearing 
or how they look, it's the energy 
that's so damn punk. Nirvana is this 
energy. 

Chris Novoselic (bass), David 
Grohl (drums), and Kurt Cobain 
(guitar) don't wear mohawks or 
knee-high combat boots on stage. 
Playing variations of the four-chord 
rock theme, they pack enough en-
ergy into their set to power several 
small cities. Playing at Iguana 's last 
Thursday night, Nirvana brought 
the casa down. 

cal pot-head type deductions -
that's what wewerethinkingaboul." 

Some longtime Nirvana fans 
seem to think the band has taken a 
more pop-oriented route with 
Nevermi1id. It seems nowadays if a 
band changes, it's sold out. If it 
doesn't change. it's rehashing what 
made it popular. When confronted 
with this question, Novosel ic copped 
an attitude. 

"We're in it for the music. Being 
in a band is trying to make a state-
ment. Some bands make a vibe and 
try to stick with it, and their songs 
suck. [For us), if a song has a vibe 
we follow that vibe. I'm totally 
stoked on [Nevermind], pleased as a 
peach." 

Novoseliccontinued, " [The new 
album) is less scary stuff [than 
Bleach. their debut]. Geffen had 
nothing to do with it. No way is any 
label going to tell us what to do. 
That's disappoiming that people 
think that [we sold out]." 

Comrol is something few bands 
can claim on their firsi major label 
release. Nirvanaeven had control of 
the video fotthe firstsingle, "Smells 
Like Teen Spirit." 

JInniIIr KoIIky/Gla*l 
Singer/guitarist Kurt CobaIn gets a light from a member of the crowd at Iguana's In Tijuana. 

Nevermilld, the band's late t en-
deavor, and its first on a major label 
(Geffen), has sold over 200,000 
units. Not too bad for a band which, 
until recently, enjoyed underground 
status. In a recent interview, 
Novoselic waxed on the popularity 
Nirvana is currently enjoying. Did 
anyone think Nirvana would have 
made it this far? HOh no, we never 
thought about it - never goal ori-
ented. Partying, playing, philosophi-

"It was basically our idea," 
NovoseJic explained. "It was our 
idea for the anarchy high school, it 
just got changed a little. It's just 
some wild pep assembly. Instead of

years. Not only IhaI. it will be an 
AmcricaIi opera filled with Ameri-
em tunes. WIlIzes, and marches. 

'"The MoIber of Us All" was 
created by composer Virgil 
Thomson and authorGcrtrudeStein. 
American operas in general , ac-
cording to Kris Henyey, adminis-
tnltivelS&istantlwldlingtheopera's 
public relalioos, deal with political 
issues imtead of the usual love st0-
ries. 

"The MoIherofUs All" is about 
the life and career of suffragette 
Susan B. AnIhony. The opera por-
trays the progress of Anthony's 
SbUggle and the fonnation of her 
social conscience. AntI'Iony dealt 
heavily with the issues of slaveI)' 
and women's rights, especially the 
right to vote. 

The lead will be played by Martha 
Jane Weaver, who is recognized for 
her expressive interpretations. 
Weaver has appeared in several 
operas and chorus perfonnances. 
She made her most m:ent appear-
ance in an opera as Giovanna in San 
Diego Opera's "Rigoletto." 

Last moncb, Weaver debuted in 

Ibe Mozart requiem with the Or-
.. CouIIIy Singers. 

The performers will be made up 
in authentic Victorian clothing 
which wiD also be worn It the suf-
fn&«te nlly today. The pupoee of 
Ibe rally is to brina IltenIion to Ihc 
issues of women's suffraae and Ihc

II EIec:tioo Day, which is Nov. S. 
The operabu become a tool tocnter 
political grounds. , 

According to Ihc press release 
from Ihc La loUa Symphony Or-
chcslra, "The fashion world doesn 't 
usually get too political, but suf-
fngeucs gained visibility through 
fashion. The opera world doesn't 
usually get too political, but opera 
lovers know the importance and 
power of a voice." 

Because this feminist opera is 
unfamiliar to many people, the re-
sponse has DOl yet been great. But 
according to Hcnyey, it is picking 
up. So far, the opera is generating 
interest in areas such as the League 
of Women Voters and many 
women's study groups . 

"The MotherofUs All" is brought 
to UCSD through the efforts and 
collaboration of UCSO's music de-
partment, visual arts department, 
theaterdcpartment, members of the 
San Diego Opera, West Coast Lyric 
Works and the La Jolla Symphony.

. bility of its power and choosing to 
go against it 

Sayles' treatment of the racial 
tensions and issues which arise in a 
large city is surprisingly sensitive 
and accurate. 

The actors give perfo~ 
which chalJenge the viewer to con-
sider the plight of the inner-city 
citizens of any large city. The dia: 
logue and conflicts are so real, so 
inbicate, that it is difficult to picture 
one man directing the people we 
sec on screen. 

Surprisingly. one of the central 
characters in the story of Nick's 
life, Carl. is played by Sayles him-
self. Of the roles Sayles has given 
himself in his movies, Carl is the 
most importanl- aDd his perfor-
mance demaDds aaention. 

Carl is an aging street "hood" 
who runs all of abe bad elements in 
tbeneiptxxboocL Heeven gets paid 
by the city to start fires in housing 
projects so new condominiwns can 
be buill. 

Sayles hils brouaht many com-
peUin,lIOries to abescreen.1Ild has 
sbowed us the best performances 
possible from talented actors and 
acbaIes. "Cty of Hope" is the best 
of aU of these dIinp.
