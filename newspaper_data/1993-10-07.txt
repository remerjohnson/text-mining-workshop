Union Tour 
Group Held 
In Mexico 
NAFTA: UCSD student among 
those detained on fact-finding 
trip by Mexican officials 
By francisco DeVrie. 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a potentially damaging blow to the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFf A), 
Mexican authorities detained a group of over 
three dozen American and Canadian citizens, 
including a UCSD student, who were touring 
Tijuana industrial parks and workers' neigh-
borhoods as part of a fact-finding mission for 
the International Association of Machinists 
and Aerospace Workers (lAM) last month. 

Union members claim that the group was 
illegally held for several hours by immigra-
tion officials acting on complaints from the 
plant owners who were upset by their pres-
ence. 

The immigration officials boarded the fact-
fmding tour bus about 10 miles southeast of 
downIDwn Tijuana whileaformerplant wmbr 
wasdesaibing conditions in the mostly Ameri-
can-owned manufacturing plants. 

The group was charged with distributing 
~union andanti-NAFTA handbills to wort-
ers and illegally visiting an industrial plant, 
both in violation of its tourist visas. 

But Associate Editor of the lAM newspa-
per, TM Machinist, Jim Conley, who was 
among the delegation, said that at no time did 
they distribute materials and were only tour-
ing the area. 

"I think [the Mexican immigration offi-
cials] just screwed up something terrible," 
Conley said. 

In a letter 10 the Mexican Ambassador 10 
the United States, lAM President George 
Kourpias wrote, 'This flagrant auempt by 
Mexican officials to harass visitors who clearly 
were not in violation of any laws, is an outra-
geous act against common decency." 

However, Mexican Ambassador Jorge 
Montafto responded by citing the Mexican 
Migratory ACl, which forbids foreign nation-
als from engaging in activities other than 
those specified on their entry visa. 

"It has been sufficiently documented that

Groundwork Drops Discount 
CO-OP: Legal fees force co-op 
to suspend its textbook rebate 
By Jon_ PIIImer 
Associate News Editor 

For the farst time since its opening in 1914, 
Groundwork Boob has been forced 10 cease 
offering its 1.1S percent discount on text-
books for Fall Quarter. The student-run co-op 
had 10 begin charging sales tax in order 10 pay 
off 5200,000 in legal fees incurred as a result 
of conflicts with the UCSD administration 
over the past several years. 

According to co-op member Jeff Corbell, 
the co-ops have also had their rent increased 
by the administration, adding 10 their current 
financial troubles. "It bothers me thal the 
administration is trying to make a profit off of 
us, "Corbell said, adding that the co-ops them-
selves are non-profit organizations. 

Groundworks is only one of the co-ops 
forced 10 temporarily abandon or decrease the 
discounts for students and co-op members. 
"We've all had 10 increase prices somewhere 
10 fund the 5200,000 in legal fees, unlike the 
administration," said Groundwork Books 
member Chloe Burke. 

She added that the administration had, in 
effect, no legal fees 10 pay. "They didn't go 
with an outside legal fll'm. [They] wenl with 
the UC General Counsel." 

After years of eviction threats and pr0b-
lems ranging from the control of locks on co-
op doors 10 co-op autonomy, representatives 
from the administration and co-ops were fi-
nally able 10 reach an agreement last quarter. 
In spite of this, not all of the parties involved 
are satisfied with the oulCome. 

Corbeu emphasized, "We don't like them 
[the agreements], but we agreed to them." 

Despite the large amount of money needed 
10 pay oCf the fees, Groundwork members are 
hopeful that the debt will be paid off soon. 
"We're hoping it won't take more than a 
quarter," Burke said. 

The sooner the debt is paid oCf, the sooner 
the discount will be reinstated. "We're hop-
ing to get it back sometime this year ," Corbell 
added. 

"We're trying 10 recovec and rebuild the 
organization and [we] have 10 make sure we 
have them [the finances] before we give the 
discount back," Burke said.

While the Thonllon Hospital , 
located on the main campus, will 
help UCSD to become a regional 
heallh-care system, bringing it 
"into full operatioo wiU sipifi-
cantly weaken UCSD Medical 
Center's short-term financial po-
si Lion," according 10 a stale report. 

In a report 10 the University of 
California Board of Regents last 
month, Director of Hospitals and 
Clinics Michael Stringer blamed 
part of the medical center's pr0-
jected loss on changes throughout 
the health-care industry in San Di-
ego County. 

Kim Roberts, assistant director 
of fmance at UCSD Medical Cen-
ter, said UCSD will undertake a 
"thoughtful and comprehensive 
process" 10 reduce costs, while 
trying not 10 cut paLient-<:are ser-
vices. "I view chis year as chal-
lenging," she added. Scripps Professor Wins Blue Planet Prize 

The troubling fmancial picl.Ule 
has prompted UCSD officials 10 
institute a massive cost-reduction 
program that includes plans 10 
slash 570 million in expenses from 
medical center operating budgets 
over the next three years. During 
the flfSt year, UCSD administra-
IasplanS23 millionincuts, which 
account for eight percent of the 
medical center's 5266 miUion an-
nual expense budget. 

Although the lavish Thornton 
Hospital was opened in July, it is 
currently operating 48 of its 120 
beds. 

The hospital was designed to 
• treat well-insured patients, boost-

ing the medical center's bouom

However, such a drastic cut 
could mean reductions in some 
patient services at the Hillcrest 
facility, according 10 hea1th-care

For the 1992-93 fISCal yeal, the 
medical center suffered its nrst 
operating deficit in a decade. It 
faced a $3.2 million deficit. but 
ended the fiscal year with a $10.6 
million profit made possible by 
the Slate bailout funds. In 1993-
94, however, less bailout money 
will be made available. 

The report predicts Ihat during 
the 1994-95 the medical center 
will will be in the black, posting an 
518 million profit in its total bud-
get. It predicts a $20.8 million 
profit for the following fiscal year. 
However, these projections are 
based on the expense-cutting plan 
now under way and may be sub-
ject 10 even more changes as the 
federal government moves 10 dra-
matically alter the healch-care sys-
tem through President Clinton's 
health-care reform plan. 

Nevertheless, Stringer ex -
pressed pride in the 120-bed 
Thornton Hospital, which serves 
all UCSD faculty and staff mem-
bers. "One of the exciting aspects 
of having 8 campus-based hospi-
tal is that we can better serve the 
health-care needs of our own

Recycling Clusters Placed on Campus 
By RItu IueIIII 
St." Writer 

Ftfteen new recycling clustus 
have been placed OIl the OCSD 
campus through ajoint effcnof the 
Recycle Co-op, Senior Gift Com-
miueeandPhysicalPiantServices. 

All three groups hope Ihat the 
bins will increase awareness of 
the rec)'(:ling effort on campus, 
according to RecycleCo-op mem-
ber Dan Hurst. Hurst said that the 
purpose of the bins is not only to 
promote recycling, but also 10 
make people aware of over-con-
sumption of aluminum cans. 

"I hope the clusters also make 
people realize that we can't con-
tinue 10 conswne these beverages 
at the same volume that we are 
now," said HursL 

Each cluster has three bins made 
from 100 percent post-consumer 
plastics. The bins are designated 
for aluminum, clear glass and col-
ored glass. According to Hurst, 
recycljng these materials is profit-
able, as opposed to recycling pa-
per products. 

"We tried white-paper recy-
cling a couple of years ago, but 
unfortunately, we lost money,"

The groups are already plan-
ning recycling cluster sites in ar-
eas such as the old Student Center,

the Biomedical Library and the 
entrance IOCentral Library. School 
of Medicine Dean John F. Alksne 
and the Price Center architect de-
nied the installation for reasons of 
unsightliness, according 10 Hurst. 

The project has bcenin the plan-
ning stages for 30 months and was 
funded by graduating seniors 
through theOCflCeof Annual Giv-
ing as well as8$22,OOO grant from 
the State Division of Recycling. 

"We let them know ahead of 
time [and] nobody left us," Olsen 
said. 

Although textbooks may be a 
bit more expensive at the co-op, 
the bookstore is continuing 10 of-
fer the 1.15 percent discount on 
everything other than textbooks, 
including magazines and regular 
books.

Professor Irons Doing the. 
Public a Judicial Service 

By making available actual tapes of Supreme Court <nl argu-
menLS along with his recenl publication, May II Please lhe COWl, 
UCSD Political Science Professor Peter Irons soughlto provide both 
his studenlS and the public with a unique oppOrtunity to observe and 
learn from the court firsthand. In SO doing, however, he violated an 
agreement with the National Archives and incurred the wrath of the 
court and the attention of the news media. 

The tapes, which accompany May II Please tile COWl, contain 
recordings of oral argumenLS made in 23 landmark Supreme Court 
cases over the pasl35 years. Irons' motivation f<r distributing these 
was soleI y educational. [t is highly doublfulthat he had any intention 
of provoking the court for the purpose of publicity, nor was he out to 
make a profit Irons is a professor. One can only assume that he 
distributed the tapes out of the desire 10 further the educational 
inicreslS of his Sludents. 

There is no question that Irons is guillY of breach of contract. But 
the burden of justification in this case should DOl fallon Irons - it 
should fallon the court. What is the motivation behind the enforce-
ment of such a rule? Court proceedings are open to the press and 
public, so why does the court become irrilal.ed when court transcripts 
are circulated among the mass media or in national publications? 

This sentiment has been expressed several times dwing the past 
few years, as evidenced by the court's denial of C-SPAN covelllge 
rights and by reservations over former Justice William Brennan's 
desire to publish court notes and memoirs. 

The high court should consider Irons' intention of providing 
university studenls with a valuable educational resource in studying 
how our nation's lOp judicial instilUtion opera&cs. Although its 
irritation with Irons' actions is somewhat underslaDdable, they need 
to consider the big picture. Access 10 court transcripts sbould DOt be 
limited to academics with a lot of cash (the National Althivea doea 
charge a hefty fee). Hthe Supreme Court wishes topreventincidenlS 
like this again. they should make public court transcripts available 10 
the Library of Congress. This way oral argumenLS would be placed 
in the public realm where the American citizens, the people f<r 
whom the decisions are made. may have access to them. 

Report on Chancellors' 
Pay Was Ill-advised 

UniversilY of California chancellors are woefully underpaid - at 
leasl according 10 a report issued at last month's Board of RegenlS 
meeting, The report found that the nine UC chancellors receive on 
average 14 pescentless than their colleagues at comparable univer-
sities. Surely, this news that chancell<r compensation lags behind 
other schools must really depress studenlS who have seen their fees 
go up roughly 150 pescent in the last three years. Faculty and slaff, 
facing a 3.5 percenl pay cullhis year, must also be heartbroken aboul 
the chancellors' low salaries. 

It's clear thai UC executive salaries probably aren ' t as high as 
universities in other Slales, bul other Slales don't have to deal with 
the budgetary black hole that has plagued California since 1991. 
And while chancellor compensation may be low compared to other 
colleges, the facl is, UC chancellors still have il good. UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Allinson. for instance. receives $189,400 in 
cash compensation, which is just above average for the UC system. 
That figure doesn 'teven include housing allowances, travel benefits 
and other perks that are standard for high-ranking administrators. 

Another report by the university indicated that executive salaries 
have remained the same since this wholebudgelmess began in 1991. 
In facl, 91 executives are laking home over SIOO,OOO per year. 
According to University of California Student Association (UCSA) 
Executive Director Andy Shaw, UC executives have seen a 186 
percent increase in salaries in the pasl decade. In comparison, Caculty 
members were given an 80 percent increase for that same period. 

UC spokesman Mike Alva, in defense of !he university's execu-
tive salaries, pointed out that administrators' compensation is based 
on "skil~ experience and responsibilities." That may very well be, 
but it cannot be denied that the administrative budget for the UC 
system is unusually bloated and long overdue Cor a few whacks with 
a sharpened axe. 

The university is in the midst OfiLS woot rmancial crisis ever, and 
nobody know. how long it willlasl. During these uncertain tirnea. 
it's imponant for students. faculty, staff and administrators to be in 
lhis lO8elher. For that reason, 8J'OUSing about low chancellor com-

allover 1M world, dae collUM will 
allempllo discuss ilfrom a differ· 
elll perspective , 

The rmal glinuners of hope seem 
10 be disappearing from the eyes of 
the people of Bosnia. Last week. the 
Muslim Parliament voted over-
whelmingly against what seems to 
be the Illesl in a long line of interna-
tional peace plans, purporting to 
bring stability to that devastated 
comer of Celllral Europe. 

The Owen-SlOltenberg plan, like 
ilS predecessors, would partitioo 
Bosnia into three ethnic enclaves. 
The Bosnia Muslims would hold on 
to only 31 percenl of the land while 
the Serbians would receive the spoils 
of their "viClOl'y" and be given 52 
percenlof Bosnia-Herzegovina. It 
seems incredible that aUiUs stage of 
world inlegration we still talk of 
ethnically-partitioned Slates as the 
only viable option. 

Even more dislurbing in the par-

tition is the rewarding of the rape, 
pillage and murder of civilians. Of 
course there have been atrocities 
committed on all sides. but few dis-
pute the Bosnian Serbs' perpelnl-
tion of the most horrific genocide 
since World War II 

The blame for die loss of 200,000 
Muslim lives, and the devastation of 
countless others, musl fall panly on 
the collective European govern-
menLS who have been spineless in 
their unwillingness 10 intervene and 
slop the bloodshed (and I speak as a 
European). We must then question 
President Clinton 's inactivity and 
the United StaleS' passive role. 

Many agree that the United SlateS 
needs European cooperation 10 act 
decisively in Bosnia. Bul if the 
American governmenl had been 
more steadfast initially in ilS belief 
that the killing must be SlOpped. 
then the Europeans would probably 
have caved in and gone along with 
much stricter measures againsl the 
Serbs. 

It is alwlYseasy IOcriticize with-
oul offering solulions. Some have 
argued thal we should "bomb the 
Serbs" and force them into submis-
sion. By usinlthe skills displayed 
in the Gulf War, some claim thal 
such bombing could be so "surgi-
cally" targeted that it would on1y 
lalte out beavy Serb weapons and a 
few soldiers. The aim would be 10 
frighten the Serbs inIO withdrawal

while avoiding civilian casualties. 
Bul such an argument is deeply 

flawed and displays a complete laclc 
of understanding of the Serbian 
psyche. For staners,the Allied "sur-
gical bombing" of Iraq in the Gulf 
War was far less successful than we 
were first led to believe. Many of 
theBe "smart bombs" went astray, 
causing their share of civilian casu-
alties. Much of the damage was ac-
tually conducted by the old B-52s 
through carpet bombing. One has 
only 10 recall the war in Vietnam to 
know iLS appalling effects. 

Evenifwecould takeoutSerbian

Serbian hostility even further. In-
evitably, this could lead 10 increased 
reprisals against die Muslims and 
CroalS in the surrounding areas. nOl 
lO mention cootinued auacks upon 
European peacekeepers presently 
engaged in vila! humanitarian work. 

Another proposal for inlerna-
tionaiaction is 10 lift the ban on ann 
sales to Bosnian Muslims. On the 
flce of il, this has appeal. Why not 

even up die sides md allow the 
Muslims 11 leul the chance !Ode-

. fend lhemselves? Once again the 
argumenl is lOO simplistic. It is not 
thal easy lO gel enormous cannons

A second questioo addresses the 
possible motives Wldetlying the 
Bosnians' use of theBe 1lI1Ul. As 

journalist Misha Glenny, author of 
The Fall of Yugoslavia, wrote, 
"Bosnia needs another lank: like it 
needs a hole in the head." He argues 
thal some of these inlernationally-
supplied weapons would be used by 
Muslims 10 take similar horrific and 
retaliatory SlepS against Serbian and 
Croatian civilians. 

One serious option thal has never 
been fully pursued by the inlerna-
tional community is the total isola-
tion of the Republic of Serbia, which 
remains the Bosnian Serbs'lifeline, 

If economic embargoes were 
fully enforced againsl Serbia, the 
prospectS of compromise in Bosnia 
would be greatly enhanced. This 
would require the cooperation of 
the Russians, who have tradition-
ally sympathized with the Serbian 
nation - bul given Yellsin's lenu-
ous position. he is willing 10 oblige 
the West. 

In addition. the United Slales and 
Europe must demonstrate lo the 
Serbs thal they are not willing to 
tolerate any further slaughter. If they

, are to back up their displeasure with 
die real threat of military action, it 
mUSl be made clear to the Wesl that 
the operation would not be "surgi-
cally clean," bul would more likely 
to be as bloody and ugly as any other 
war. 

If we fail to bring peace lo the 
Balkans, the future grows darker for 
the Bosnian Muslims and Europe as 
a whole. Perhaps the Bosnian Par-
liament was right in rejecting the 
latest peace plan, since it offered 
nothing in the way of protection for 
the future. The Owen-SlOltenberg 
plan aClually Slated that the Serbian 
and Croatian SlaleS could secede 
after two years and merge with their 
respective "mother republics." This 
would leave the tiny Bosnian Mus-
lim stale surrounded by enemies only 
to be swallowed up within a maUCr 
of months. 

For Europe, there is the possibil-
ity the war would spill over into 
Macedonia and Kosovo, creating 
what Glenny calls "the third Balkan 
War." This would inevilably draw 
in the Greeks, Albanians, Turks and 
Bulgarians - all defending their 
interests and declaring war by proxy.

just for starters. 

Lest one forget.theQintons have

guise of national health reform. Any 
savings the Gore plan manages [0

What's $100 billion in the face of

about the computer equipmenL

NAFT A opponents have been

further proof that the agreement is 
flawed, boIh because of Ihe labor 
conditions lhey found and because 
of lheir treatment by Mexican au-
thorities.

egation had visited an aircraft

According 10 Conley ,the work-
ers were being paid $7 a day at 
most for their work and their liv-
ing conditions were akin 10 "refu-
gee camps." He cited an open 
sewer running from the nearby 
plantlhrough the camp. 

Kourpias also wroce that the 
incident "confannsour worst fears 
about !be Nonh American Free 
Trade Agreement," and thai the 
union members documented sev-
eral violations of Mexican labor 
law before being detained. 

The Mexican ambassadcv's re-
sponse 10 KourpiaS' leuer did not 
address the alleged labor viola-
tions.

and crap going on with the A_S., 
that would take about three or four 
days," he said, adding lhal on one 
occasion this led 10 a poslpOllC> 
ment of an issue by three days. 

Lutz also claims that one of the 
computers hasn't worked in a year 
and the system has been plagued 
by unauthorized users who gain 
access 10 the facility because "the 
doors are almost never locked." 
Also, the computers have a "ri-
diculously small" amount of hard 
drive memory for the large amount 
of publications that are dependent 
on them, according 10 Lutz. 

"Just about anyone could come 
in there and mess with it," he said. 

Park intends 10 solve these types 
of problems with the alternative 
media proposal, which has three 
objectives. She plans 10 put brand

''This is not the type of free

Without a doubt, the Kronos Quartet is 
the hippest classical string quartet you'll 
ever see. The Bay area band, which per-
forms at 8 p.m. today in Mandeville Audito-
rium, revolutionized the concept of the stri ng 
quanet by including contemporary songs 
such as Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze" into 
its repenoire. Us most recent releases in-
clude String Quartets No. I alld 2 by the 
Polish composer Henryk Mikolaj Gorecki 
and Short Stories, a collection of pieces by a 
variety of composers. Duri ng a recent phone 
interview, violinist David Harrington spoke 
about his philosophy of music and some of 
the pieces the quartet will perform tonight. 

Q ..... : I wu Iooklnl at your 
tour .checIuIe and you appear to be 
on tour moat of the year, travell. 
to Europe, Mexico, I.r ... and ell 
ecroa. the U.S. In meny ways this 
must be aratlfylnl, but I.n't It exdt· 
.... _ well1 Whet do you do to keep 
It excltlnl and keep your personal 
IIY_ Intact? 

Harrington: Right at the moment, we're 
putting three or four new pieces together-
radically new pieces and it's very exciting 
from the standpoint of hearing these new 
pieces. To take something new out to an 
audience and see what the concert of Octo-
ber 1993 will be like is something we enjoy. 
For me, it gives me a lot of energy. The 
traveling and the hotels are a fact orlife. The 
music and the audiences are worth all the 
trouble. The four of us have played together 
vinually every day for 15 years. We're hav-
ing a good time. 

What pieces will you perform at 
the Mendeville Auditorium? 

We're going to be playing a new piece 
called "Elvis Everywhere" Iwhich isl by 
Michael Daugherty. Michael went 10 an 
Elvis impersonator convention and gOt to 
know some of the impersonators and made 
this piece usi ng them and us , so we will be 
putting that together. Tilen there is music 
by Osvaldo Golijov. His music is deeply 
influenced by Yiddish music . He's a won-
derful composer. John Oswald was here 
yesterday, and we will be premiering his 
piece that deals with different kinds of 
metal music, like heavy metal and speed 
metal. He' s (he guy that rips everybody off 
unmercifully and the end result is some-
thing that is only Oswald. John Zorn intro-
duced him to me. We're also playing a 
recent quartet by Philip Glass. There's a 
few other things, too. We will be playing a 
lot of music. 

The Kronos Quartet has been 
called the aeatles of classical mu-
sic. How do you feel about this 
comparison and how would you 
describe your relationship to clas-
sical music? 

I think the Beatles were a great quartet. 

Marlon EWinger 

So for the Kronos to be 
thought of in that way i~ a 
compliment. r don't think 
about our relationship to 
classical m\lsic. J think ench 
of the composers who writes 
for us [has his or hel'l own

MOVIES 

Boys in the Bronx 

Courtesy of Phillip CarusO/Savoy Pictures 
G ..... ter rt........ Sonny (Chazz Palmlnterl, far left) 
confronts Lorenzo {Robert De NIro, far right>. 

Robert De Niro s directorial debut 
is a realistic portrait of one boy's life 

Calogero (Francis Capra), a 
nine-year-old boy growing up in 
the Bronx, faces two alternatives. 
He can emulate Sonny (Chazz 
Palminteri), the wealthy gangster 
who runs the neighborhood, or he 
can follow his father Lorenzo (Rob-
ert De Niro) who struggles to make 
ends meet as a city bus driver. A 
Bronx Tale, De Niro's directorial 
debut, explores the challenges a 
young boy faces growing up in an 
Italian neighborhood in New York 
during the '60s. 

Calogero quickly becomes en-
tangled in the Mafia when he sees 
Sonny murder another man on the 
street. Calogero must then decide 
whether or not he will turn in one of 
the men he has admired and emu-
lated for so long. He subsequently 
learns that each decision he makes 
in life has a profound impact on his 
future. 

Making choices is just one of 
the issues the film deals with. Once 
he becomes older, the 17-y~ar-old 

" 

By Susan BronzInl 
Guardian Reporter 

Calogero (Lillo Brancato) has to 
make personal decisions about rac-
ism, education, violence and inter-
racial dating. During the eight-year 
span of the film, Calogero also has 
to choose his role model. 

Lorenzo and Sonny are at odds 
with each other, but they share a 
mutual interest in Cal,ogero's fu-
ture. Sonny tells him to stay in 
school and avoid the gangster 
lifestyle. His father gives him good 
advice as well, saying "the saddest 
thing in life is wasted talent. Don't 
waste yours." 

Although the film tackles some 
serious topics, it ~ontains enough 
laughs and light moments to be 
entertaining. 

The acting in A Bronx Tale is 
first-rate. Brancato is excellent as 
the older Calogero, and Palminteri 
gives a sympathetic portrayal of a 
gangster. The story is actually 
based on the childhood experiences 
of Palminteri, who grew up in the 
Bronx and witnessed a shooting as 

a young boy. 
The film also features a special 

appearance by Joe Pesci (Lethal 
Weapon) , but the majority of the 
charar.ters are played by nonpro-
fessionals who are residents of the 
New York area. De Niro thought 
that the use of real people from the 
Bronx would give acertain authen-
ticity to the film , which was shot 
entirely on location in New York. 

As Calogero grows up, he learns 
to choose between the traditions of 
the Italian-American community 
he wants to retain and those he 
cannot personally accept. ,He has 
encounters with friends and neigh-
bors with conflicting morals. 

Ultimately, Calogero has to de-
cide whether he wants to be like his 
father or like Sonny. At one point 
in the film Calogero asks Sonny, 
"[s it better to be loved or fearedT 
Sonny's Machiavellian answer is 
that it is better to be feared, but 
Calogero realizes only he can de-
cide what his future will be.

KRONOS: 'We 
live in an incredible 
time for music' 
Continued from page H1 
relationship to the past, and we do 
too. It's reflected differently in 
the recordings we make and the 
pieces we play. 

But H seems like your 
performances are critical 
of stuffy, upper-class clas-
sical music concerts. 

They [other classical string 
quartets] are just not having as 
good a time as we are. Our instru-
ments can become percussion in-
struments, and if you use elec-
tronics, they can become different 
things other than being from the 
family of bowed stringed instru-
ments . 

I delight in that transforma-
tion. I don't feel limited as a mu-
sician or person because I playa 
violin. I feel like the instrument 
allows me to take part in a vast 
world of music that I don ' t feel I 
could take part in if I played any 
other instrument. Actually the 
instrument is the quartet itself. It 
is a collective instrument. 

I think the Kronos Quar-
tet is remarkable for the 
way it moves between 
"high" and "low" forms of 
culture. But to do this you 
have to have a knowledge 
of many different forms of 
music. Are you ever simply 
overwhelmed with the 
amount of music and mate--
rial you must try to learn? 

One thing I need to say is that I 

don ' t think of our music in a ver-
tical way, so there is not a high 
and low. For me, it 's more circu-
lar. There is much more an inte-
gration . and people never know 
where they ' re going to get their 

. next musical experience. I think 
we li ve in an incredible time for 
music, and the possibility we have 
for relating with musicians from 
other parts of the world is just 
phenomenal. 

You formed Kronos 
Quartet after hearing 
"Black Angels" on the ra· 
dio. What kind of emotions 
are invested in uBlack An-
gels" and In what ways is 
your work political? 

Every time I play that piece 
I' m reminded of what it fe lt like 
during the Vietnam War. That 
piece has a resonance that few 
works do. When I heard it more 
than 20 years ago, I knew exactly 
how I was going to spend the rest 
of my time. I felt defi ned . 

It 's not o ften that I fee l that 
way. I think any time you make a 
decision, you' re making a state-
ment about the kind of life you 
want and the kind of world you 
want to li ve in . 

But I think people often 
feel that classical music 
isn't political because there 
are no words. 

I don' t think words are the 
mo t polit ical th ings you can do 
in life. People have learned how 
to bullshit in words. You can' tdo 
that in music. It 's too honest. You 
can hear right into the center of 
that person. ThaI' s one of the 
things llike about music.
