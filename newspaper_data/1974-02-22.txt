Quiet On The Campu8e8 

ROTC Makes A COJDeback 
by John Taylor 

The Reserve Officers' Training Corps 
(ROTC), four years ago the object 0 1 
anti-war protests and demonstrations 
on many of the nation's college 
campuses, seems to be making a quiet, 
almost unnoticed comeback . For 
although enrollment has decreased 
substantially (155,000 in 1970, com-
pared with 60,000 last October), 392 of 
the nation's schools - 39 more than in 
1970 - now offer ROTC programs, and 
at schools such as Stanford and Dart-
mouth, which dropped ROTC, efforts 
are being made to reinstate it. 

San Francisco, outlined the progress of 
the ROTC programs at UC Berkeley, 

And a memorandum, directed to the 
UC Regent's Committee on Educational 
Policy at the February 14 meetinR in 

Davis, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. 
All but Davis report some increase in 
enrollment. 

Symbolic Bomb Craters 

In a recent article in the Los Angeles 
Times, Col. Carl F. Bernard, Chairman 
of the Department of Military Science 
at UC Berkeley, remarked, "We've 
strengthened our position and at the 
same time animosity has gone way 
down here. I've walked around this 
campus in uniform for a year and a half 
now without a si ngle adverse com-
ment." And at the University of Oregon, 

Budget Committee Allocates 
Funds 

by Rick Drom 

The budget sub-
committee for T.U.S.C. 
decided Wednesday to 
increase its support of the 
Program Board by 62%; 
from 524,000 to S39,OOO. 
Under this plan, 1/3 of all 
student activity fee money 
would be spent on campus 
programming. This wouldÂ· 
be equal to about 
$6/student/year. 

Other recommendations 
included allotting 510,000 
next year for a full-time 
secretary; 517,000 to pay 
for "subsidiary journals", 
like the North Star; and 
$2,500 for eight telephones. 
These recommendations, in 
essence, will affect all 
student organizations now 
receiving money from 
T.U .S.C. by allocating 

money that they might have 
received. 

The ' Undergraduate 
Student Council (T.U .S.C.) 
will vote on these financial 
recommendations at its 
meeting on Monday, 
February 25, at 6:00 P.M . in 
250 M.C. If it passes these 
recommendations, it will 
have contradicted its own 
recommendations of last 
year. 

The budget sub-
committee last year urged 
the Program Board to 
become more self-sufficient 
so that less student activity 
fee money would be used in 
the future . Instead the 
Program Board has asked to 
increase its funding from 
T.U.S.C. by 515,000 and 
decrease its funding from 
the Registration Fee 

Committee by 511,000; 
from 581,000 to 570,000. 

Under the present 
proposal T.U.S.C. would 
give the Program Board 
extra funds next year to 
help programming at UCSD. 
In the following years, 
T.U.S.C. plans to decrease 
its funding of the Board . 

The proposed full-time 
secretary for next year 
would be placed in the new 
student center. This person 
would help T.U.S.C., the 
U.c. Student Lobby and the 
Communications Board. 
The person would also 
answer telephones for the. 
other student groups in the 
Center. 

Under this subcommittee 
proposal, the Triton Times 
and kSOT would be funded

Salk Discusses Human Values, 
New Scientific Approaches 

by Rich Pool 

Wednesday night, in the 
Revelle cafeteria, Dr. Jonas 
Salk, discoverer of the polio 
vaccine and director of the 
Salk Institute spoke to 
people first about the goals 
of the Salk Institute and 
afterwards about his ideas 
on the future of mankind. 

Dr. Salk stated that the 
I nstitute has three orien-

tations : Biology, Medicine 
and HumanIty. The 
biological studies include 
gene regulation, the aging 
process, neurobiology and 
prebiotic chemistry. The 
medical research concerns 
the immune system in the 
body in relation to cancer 
(which Dr. Salk is in-
vestiptinl) and hormone 
and fertility control. Dr. 
Salk feels that the most 

important human istic 
problem for the institute is 
the application of the 
understanding of biological 
processes to human 
ystems. 

Words flowed easily 
when Dr . Salk then 
presented, (using slides), his 
hypothesis that we are 
living in a time of transition 

continued on PAP 2 

where ROTC facilities were once 
bombed and burned, the head of the 
Army ROTC unit reported, " In the 
spring of '72 they dug 'symbolic bomb 
cnters' in ot'r front yard. It's been quiet 
since then " 

In general, ROTC officials hope that 
their programs will grow and be suc-
cessfu l because of a number of factors : 
the overall decl ine in (or disappearance 
of) campus antimilitary sentiment, the 
adding of scholarships and increased 
benefits, revised and modernized 
curriculums, and the chance that a 
'different kind' of student might be 
entpring college now. 

At Berkeley the Department of 
Military Sciences has increased its 
number of courses by seven, to 19, so 
that, according to a report from the 
UCB Chancellor's office, potential 
officers will be able to " understand 
more fully the military profession 
before being commissioned ." In ad-
dition, that report indicated a con-
tinued increase in enrollment, both 
among members and nonmembers of 
ROTC. And the Berkeley Naval Science 
department reported a substantial 
increase in enrollment, owing to, 
among other things, the " reduction or 

tempering of anti-military sentiment." 
Overall enrollment in the Department 
of Aerospace Studies is up 50 per cent 

Davis reported a decrease in 
enrollment, attributed to the end of the 
draft, but predicted a new upward trend 
"as evidenced by a (ROTC) freshman 
class of 34." The Davis Military Science 
department also reported success in 
allowing non-ROTC students to enroll 
in its courses. 

UCLA showed increases in 
enrollment in Naval and aerospace 
courses, while enrollment in military 
science courses decreased. The decline 
was again attributed to the end of the 
draft. UCLA also indicated that a new 
policy requiring that all new ROTC 
instructors have master's degrees 
relevant to the area they teach has 
improved the quality of instruction 

Finally, UC Santa Barbara showed an 
increase in first year enrollment from 13 
to 20 cadets. and an increase from 34 to 
43 cadets 'ln overall enrollment. 

All four of the UC campuses with 
ROTC have authorized the enrollment 
of women in their military programs; 
presently, enrolled are 19 women at 
Berkeley, six at Davis, 12 at UCLA, and 
five at Santa Barbara. 

DC Campuses Tackle 

Energy Problems 
by Jerry Schneider 

Shutting off heat in dormitories and 
disconnecting water coolers are two 
examples of the extreme energy saving 
methods put into effect at U campuses 
to cope with demands by government 
agencies and utility companies to cut 
energy consumption. 

The cut-off heat to the dormitories at 
Santa Barbara on Jan . 5, lasted only 24 
hours. Irate parents of students, when 
notified of the emergency measure 
threatened the University with breach 
of dorm contracts which stipulated that 
room maintain fac i lities present at the 
time the contracts were signed in 
September. 

Other less drastic steps have been 
more effective and have received wider 
support. 

At Santa Cruz and Berkeley cam-
puses, transportation is a large energy 
consuming activity. Both Universities 
are partners in different joint programs 
with Bay Area Rapid Transit. At 
Berkeley, the University plans to put 
into operation an experimental shuttle 
bus system to BART stops, allowing 
students to commute cheaply to the 
greater San Francisco bay area. The 
buses will run on low-cost natural gas. 
The facility, scheduled to begin on Mar. 
1, will run at seven minute intervals. 

Students at Santa Cruz may drive 
half-way to the Bay Area park free of 
charge in a BART lot, and travel by 
rapid transit the rest of the way. 

According to spokesmen at each 
campus, including UCSD, numerous 
general energy saving ideas have either 
been put into effect or at least 
proposed . These include the 
elimination of decorative lighting, 
shutting off heating and lighting 
systems in non-use hours, and cur-
tailment of the use of UC vehicle . 

Most of these changes are vital to 
these campuse if they wish to 
guarantee themselves energy resources 
in coming months. For example, most 
campuses, including UCSD, are on 
interruptable gas service. This means 
that supplies of gas for heating cou ld be 
cut off at any t ime without prior notice. 

Each campus maintains re erve of 
either fuel oil, sulphur-burning fuel, or 
natural gas in case their main source of 
fuel is terminated . 

Only at Santa Barbara is there danger 
of a complete shutdown becau e of a 
dimini hing propane gas reservoir. 

At UClA, located lose to 
metropolitan Lo Angele , effort to 
reduce eneray consumption are purred 

even further by mandates from the city 
Department of Water and Power to 
reduce consumption by 20 per cent. So 
far the campus has complied with this 
order. 

However, UCLA is experiencing 
difficulties keeping under the proposed 
UC budget for electricity . Ad-
ministrators estimate that use in 
January could run 50 per cent over the 
amount allowed in the budget. 

Several campuses have gone further 
than the across - the - board cutdowns. 
Irvine, Riverside, Los Angeles and Santa 
Cruz all have taken similar additional 
steps in overall energy redudion . These 
include cutting off the flow of hot water 
in non-residential areas, disconnecting 
water coolers, and lowering the water 
temperatures in swimming pools. 

A bell-tower at Riverside is dark and 
silent . Nancy Ross, staff writer for the 
campus newspaper, The Highlander, 
stated that the campus has replaced 
three quarters of its vehicles with an 
economy car, the American Motor's 
Hornet. 

Stickers urging conservation of 
lighting and ventilation are posted all 
around the University. Their efforts 
have accounted for an overall 25 per 
cent savings in energy, Ross said . 

Another unique idea is employed at 
Santa Cruz . Tom O'Leary, public in-
formation officf'r, stated that the 
University has replaced campus 
passenger cars with nine transport vans 
to carry classes on trips. 

Since Santa Cruz houses about half 
its students, dormitory residents have 
been strongly encouraged to conserve 
heat, stated O'Leary. 

To encourage fuel con ervation at 
Berkeley, the campu ha opened a bike 
lot which will accommodate 500 bIke , 
according to a pL'blic information 
officer. On the oth r hand, the con-
struction of parking lot tructure for 
the Northern Califolnia campu ha 
been halted.

Civil War Widows 
Entitled to Relief 

The Veterans Administration has begun another 
"outreach" effort to inform widows of Civil War 
veterans they're entitled to a S55 monthly aid and at-
tendance allowance if they are eligible. This allowance 
is in addition to death compensation and death pension 
payments. 

Officials noted that in December 1973, there were 511 
Civil War beneficiaries (272 widows and 239 helpless 
children) on the agency's rolls. There were 548 last June. 

The averafe age of Civil War widows is 89.1 years, 
.with 26 of them 100 years old or more. The oldest Union 
Army widow is 117 years old, compared to 105 for the 
oldest Confederate Army widow. 

VA officials said 197 of the 272 surviving Civil War 
widows draw aid and attendance benefits . Of the 75 
who do not, four are more than 100 years old . There are 
1.2 million widows from all wars on VA compensation 
and pension rolls. 

There are no Civil War veterans, the last Union Army 
veteran died in 1956 at the age of 109. The last Con-
federate Army veteran was 117 years old when he died 
in 1959. 

Cousteau Raps System 
(M ary-Frances Spratt, UC Davis Cal. Aggie) W ith 

cheers sweeping through Freeborn Hall , Phillippe 
Cousteau proclaimed "As students studying and lear-
ning, you are already gathering the tools and weapons 
that are going to clobber the old bastards." Referring to 
the politicians and polluters who have buried nature's 
beauty am idst waste, the underwater adventurer was 
reflecting upon a student's role in combating pollution . 
"The news is disaster everywhere." 

Cousteau, son of Jacques Cousteau, believes " The 
problems are overwhelmingly due to an inadequate 
social system," in which profit and exploitation prevail . 
Politicians make rash decisions regarding energy 
problems to please the voters without regard to the long 
term effects . 

Cousteau's father recently sent a telegram to 
President Nixon stating "We have no right to com-
promise the health and safeguard of our children just for 
the commodities of our day." 

Energy at UCSD 
Energy savin[ programs at UCSD are showing results, 

according to t he latest issue of the Campus Staff 
Gazette. "Thes.' savings can definitely be attributed to 
the care of most personnel in turning out lights when 
not needed anc! a general attelrl~l Lo monitor the use of 
energy dependent equipment. Reduction of heat in 
buildings is 10o\lElring fuel demand, and the reduced 
speed limit (50 nph) being observed by most University 
drivers is incr~asing the miles per gallon of UCSD 
vehicles. All in:lividuals need to support this program, 
and maintain that effort to assure that UCSD produces a 
positive ENERCY CONSERVATION record . 

" The efforts of the Physical Plant Department, as of 
the end of January, have resulted in a known reduction 
of electrical energy demand of 70,000 Kw hours per 
month . This reduction develops from disconnection of 
light fixtures plus the reduced use of fans and pumps. In 
comparison to the last report in the GaÂ£ette, added 
effort of PPD has increased annual savings in fuel oil at 
the generating plant by 95,304 gallons, making a total 
estimated savings of 113,545 gallons of fuel oil per 
year ." 

list of suggested classes. 
The California Public 

Interest Research Croup has 
chosen classes in 7 different 
departments at UCSD. 
Though many other courses 
will enable students to 
contribute to the com-
munity, these are a rough 
sampling : 

The Rise of Con-
sumerism; Contemporary 
Issues 21 

Defining the Quality of 
Life: Economics 167 

Urban Social Problems: 
Sociology 120 

The University Town 
Center: Urban and Rural 
Studies 109 

Political Profiles of 
Officials: Political Science 
198 (Dr. Stanley) 

Money is one quantity 
that is in short supply at 
UCSD, as many student 
groups can testify . But, if a 
new course in "grant-
smanship" is offered next 
quarter, things might be 
different at UCSD. 

Mark Bookman, director 
of the new student center, 
has offered to help students 
set up a course in writing 
funding grants. If enough 
students and faculty help 
organize this course, and 
show interest in it, it will be 
offered for credit in the 
Spring . 

According to Bookman, 
foundations offer a lot of 
money that UCSD student 
projects would qualify for. 

Extension Classes 
University of California Extension, San Diego an-

nounces that spring quarter registration wi II open 
Monday, Feb. 25 . 

Ex~ore catalogs for spring are now being mailed, and 
will abailable at city, county and UCSD libraries. 

Many classes begin the week of April 1, with short 
courses planned throughout the quarter. 

A pootography class will take "spring break" in the 
Big Sur and at Hearst Castle, doing camera studies of 
nature and architecture. First meeting for the 
photographers is March 26. 

A general interest lecture series will present scientists 
from the Salk Institute who will give " Perspectives on 
Man." 

Extension offers ongoing programs for business 
people, workers in the medical field , and teachers, as 
well as citizens who want to be effective in influencing 
government. 

The Extension registration office is open 8 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Monday through Thursday, through 5 p.m. on 
Fridays, and 9 a.m . to noon on Saturdays. During the 
busy period March 18 - April 12, weekday closing time 
will be extended to 9 p.m. 

Persons interested in receiving a catalog y mail are 
asked to telephone 453-2000, extension 2061. or write :

Salk 
continued from page one 
from an epoch which in-
cludes the history of man 
until now to another epoch. 
The fi rst sl ides depicted the 
"S"-shaped graph of thl' 
popu lation growth of 
various animals . The 
popu lation grows at a 
rapidly increasing rate until 
a point in time when the 
population growth rate 
begins to decrease. Dr . Salk 
feels the human population 
on earth is approaching that 
point. He suggested that 
this diametric change in the 
acceleration of population 
growth from increasing to 
decreasi ng wou I d affect 
many aspects of peoples' 
lives . Values previously 
emphasized, such as the 
prevention of death and the 
external control of people 
would be replaced by their 
opposites; birth control and 
self control. These con-
ti icti ng attitudes have 
existed togetheri I n the first 
epoch the former 
predominated; in the 
second epoch evolution 
demands that the second be 
favored. 

Dr. Salk foresees the 
beginning of a new field of 

science - Metabiology. 

Existing science and 
philosophy will be blended 

-with the aim of un-
derstanding evolution and 
nature as the processes 
precede rather than, as 
now, studying the results of 
past evolutionary changes. 
Just as the elements are the 
units for chemistry, people 
will be the units for 
metabiology. 

Repeatedly Dr . Salk 
stated his willingness to 
hear arguments against his 
theory . He responded 
eagerly to questions, asked 
by the audience . His ideas 
are extensively presented in 
his book, Survival of the 
Wisest.

This course, if it is set up, 
would beain by teach ina 
students where to look for 
funding sources for a 
particular project. It would 
then help students learn 
how to research a possible 
grant, write a grant, contact 
the necessary people, and 
follow-up on the proposal. 

Students and faculty who 
are interested in working to 
develop such a course on 
"grantsmanship" should 
call Bookman at x2943 to 
set up a meeting. Members 
of clubs and organizations 
at UCSD are especially 
encouraged to help out so

The subject of Man's foibles and ludicrous nature has 
been explored by many people in many mediums, and 
theatre is permeated by plays on this topic. Too often 
they are trite and boring. Jean Giradoux was a poet of 
wit and insight and presented a very humorous and 
novel view of this ancient subject . His play is entitled 
Amphitryon 38, and it is being presented at the Mission 
Playhouse . 

The play is set during the early d~ys of t.h~ Roman 
empire, and employs the Cods in phllosop.hlZlng upon 
and exploring the characters of mortals . Jupiter (Norbert 
Ehrenfreund) and Mercury (Robert Almanca) have a 
discussion upon this subject before coming to earth. to 
test the virtue of Alkemena (D' Ann Peace), a beautiful 
mortal Jupiter has fallen in love with .. . 

The plot is basically a tangle concerning the virtue of 
Man opposing the devious plots of the Gods. Other 
characters are trundled across the stage, however, to 
present other aspects of the beast. A trumpeter .expla ins 
how creation and beauty are more a state of mmd than 
a physical necessity. A servant extols the blessings of 
peace, and a warrior sends him .off to ~ake the town .for 
war, praising everything . associated With war as being 
the real calling and deSire of Man . 

It would seem he has a point, as Amphitryon (Stephen 
Christopher) leaves his beautiful wi~e Alkemena h~pp i l y 
in exchange for the pleasure of bemg a general In the 
army. This clears the field for Jupiter and his amorous 
'intentions, and from then on humor flows In equal 
proportions to the philosophy. 

The cast is well suited for their parts, and does an 
excellent performance of a fun show. Directress Edythe

'HI" A HUNDIIID H.CINT 'IT-CALL MY â¢â¢ oKl. AND TILL HIM TO liLLi' 

Solzhenitsyn: A Propaganda Tool 
by Mason Powell 

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and his writings are examples 
of the American media's ability to brainwash the 
American "intelligentsia ." Their reactions to 
Solzhenitsyn and his books demonstrate an amazing 
ability not to grasp the obvious, as usual. Almost 
universally in this country Solzhenitsyn is portrayed and 
accepted as a great writer and a courageous, persecuted 
Soviet diSSident, who is trying to expose the repression 
of the Soviet government during the Stalinist era. In 
doing so, he seeks a religious solution to practical 
problems. I have talked with many of these people, and 
have found it has rarely, and usually not, occured to 
them to question the truth of this man's writings. This 
kind of faith is seldom granted to authors of the left . 
Why should they a priori believe Solzhenitsyn? Many do 
not know that the crime Solzhenitsyn was convicted of 
was tantamount to collaboration with the Nazis in 
World War Two. But then, many people were jailed for 
this crime. some possibly unjustifiably by Western 
peacetime standards. (Certainly the case of Lt. Calley 
indicates the crime of an American must indeed be 
severe to merit punishment.) Does Solzhenitsyn's 
conviction necessarily make him innocent? 
Solzhenitsyn's former wife, Natalya Reshetovskaya. in 
an interview with the conservative newspaper Le Figaro, 
said she typed part of his latest book, The Gulag Ar-
chipelago, 1918-1956. while she was still his wife. She 
said : "The subject of "Gulag Archipelago', as I felt at the 
moment when he was writing it, is not in fact the life of 
the country and not even the life of the camps but the 
folklore of the camps." (New York Times, February 6. 
1974. p.5) More evidence of Solzhenitsyn's unreliability, 
again from the New York Times (2-4-74, p.14J. is a letter 
of Nikolai D. Viktevich, who is chairman of a depart-
ment of chemistry in the Soviet Union, and the man 
with whom Solzhenitsyn corresponded during the war. 
(It was this correspondence that Solzhenitsyn claims 
was responsible for his prison term ) Viktevich writes: 
"Recently I learned that my relations with Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn were mentioned in a distorted light in 
several biographies of the latter, which have been 
brought out in the West.. .He (Solzhenitsyn ) always had 
a very high opinion of himself. In the war years. he came 
to regard himself as no less than a "semi-god" and from 
this height judged what was good and bad. according to 
his own schemes and theories rather than in terms of 
reality ." Although in Gulag Archipelago Solzhenitsyn 
writes he was never tortured, Viktevich writes in 
response to being shown the records of Sozhenitsyn's 
interrogation : "The first thought that crossed my mind 
was that this was again some tactical ruse. However. not 
only was the signature extremely familiar to me. but 
there was no doubt in my mind regarding Solzhenitsyn's 
handwriting, as he had made additions and corrections 
in the record with ,is own hand. each time adding his 
signature in the ma Â·gin. My horror increased when I saw 
the names of our fl iends in these records and that they 
were also spoken (.f as persons with anti-Soviet moods 
and potential m ~rhbers of the organization-Kirill 
Simonyan. his \/ife Lida Yezeherets and even 
Aleksandr 's OW'1 wife , Natalya Alekseyevna 
Reshetovskaya . A the interrogations. SoILIIt:llit~'{f' 
described them all as inveterate anti-Sovietists who had 
been "involved in 'Â·uch activities since their university 
days. . 

Regardless of wllether or not Solzhenitsyn writes the 
truth, however , lTlany people consider his alledged 
persecution the is~ue . rhese people think the question 
that he is possibl~ not writing the truth to be moot. 
nevertheless. as a political "dissident." he must not be 
persecuted . But how has he been persecuted? Has h 
exhausted his financial resources and spent years in 
prison fighting ridiculous conspiracy charges. as did 
Bobby Sealf'. Huey Newton. and the VVAW. among 
many others? Was h fired from hiS Job and hounded 
a ross thf' rountry to be tried on a trumped-up charge 
.lnd I"llt In lilli , d~ w,. 'nl>('la f)il vi<l W:!< h,.. 1'" I t '" " 

on a one-year-to-life indeterminate sentence and finally 
murdered. as was George Jackson? Did he suffer the 
fates of Eldridge Cleaver. H. Rapp Brown, or Malcolm X? 
Was he blown up like some of the Weathermen? Or did 
he suffer the fates of torture and execution that his 
counterparts would surely get in the U.S. puppet states 
of Brazil . Uruguay. Bolivia, Chile. Greece. Spain . 
Portugal. The Phillippines. South Vietnam and South 
Korea, to name a few? (With the torturers trained at Los 
Fresnos, Texas. no less!) Needless to say, none of these 
things have happened . Recently I read in the L.A . Times 
(watch for the blatant propaganda articles of Murray 
Seeger; often they are on the front page) that the Soviet 
Union had "stepped up" its campaign of terror against 
Solzhenitsyn by publishing, for the first time. letters to 
the editor in Pravda denouncing him. Apparently the 
Soviet Union has an almost infinite number of these 
steps. since they step up their terror quite frequently 
and still have not progressed very far. These letters were 
from Soviet intellectuals as" well as workers. Yet the 
press would have us believe it is part of an "official 
campaign of terror ." The intellectuals find this 
believeable, and yet if the newspapers said one of their 
letters to the editor was "officially inspired" they would 
probably sue for libel in their outrage. (Apparently such 
a tactic is nontrivial to accomplish. since the 
republicans of this country found it necessary to send 
fake telegrams supporting the U.S. terror-bombing of 
Hanoi last Christmas .) 

Now more recently we find that the Soviet Union has 
exiled Solzhenitsyn to West Germany. where he will be 
forced to support himself (if he cannot find a job) with 
the estimated six million dollars he has in Swiss bank 
accounts from the royalties of his books . Defiant until 
the last. Solzhenitsyn refused to obey two summons for 
questioning. and was finally arrested and exiled. This 
was only one of numerous Russian laws he recently 
broke; most of the prior ones involved his dissemination 
of pro-Western propaganda. Perhaps now Solzhenitsyn 
will emigrate to a Free World country like Chile (whose 
recent bloody coup he has not yet been able to con-
demn); he probably will be in no danger there of suf-
fering the fate of Victor Jara, or the many persecuted 
Chi lean "dissidents" . Or are such things of no im-
portance in "underdeveloped" countries? Certainly the 
free press of this country is much more concerned with 
Soviet "persecution" . Hence so also are the 
manipulated propagandists. the American intellectuals. 

This article is not to be construed as a defense of 
Soviet policies. nor even as an attack on Solzhenitsyn. 
but rather as a criticism of the American intellectuals. I 
have tried to point out how American intellectuals 
perhaps as a legacy of McCarthy and the cold war. ar~ 
quick to condemn the Soviet Union without sufficient 
analysis. unreasonably. and on misinformation. They 
are unwitting tools of anti-communist. and hence anti-
Soviet. propagandists. The American press heralds 
Gulag Archipelago (published in France by the YMCA 
press while being broadcast serially by Radio Liberty) in 
its inimicable red-baiting fashion; Eric Sevareid hails 
this book-of-the-month club selection. and no doubt the 
Reader's Digest will condense it. If the Soviet Union 
does merit criticism. then it must come from the per-
spective of the left. Solzhenitsyn. who intimated ap-
proval of Nixon 's handling of the Vietnam War in his 
speech nominating Andrei Sakharov for the Nobel 
Peace prize, crit icizes the Soviet Union from the right. 
But what can one expect from someone who nominates 
the Russian version of Edward Teller for the peace prize? 
Somewhat appropos . I suppose. it was given to Henry 
Kissinger. 

We need not despair too long. however. over 
Solzhenitsyn 's forced reuniting with his royalties Some 
good might yet come out of this "cruel and brutal" 
exi le. the American intellectual may get to watch 
Solzhenitsyn intervi wed on the Dick Cavett show. The

How Green Was Our Valley 
by Malcolm Smith 

The current energy crisis and oil embargo are not just 
minor and passing problems. Rather they are the first 
signs of,a major shift in world politics : world power will 
shift from the hands of the industrialized nations into 
the eager and able grasp of the countries that produce 
the raw materials that feed the factories of the west. 

The Western World (i .e. The industrialized world) will 
experience shortages in other areas. probably within the 
next 20 or 30 years. The West imports enough raw 
materials from these countries that an embargo could 
cripple the economy of the west. Just as the oil 
producing countries have united for power. other 
producing nations will unite into one massive, powerful 
whole, using their combined strength to exploit the 
western nations. as the western nations have exploited 
them. 

Judging from the current crisis, the probable response 
of the western world will be " dog eat dog and the devil 
take the hindmast". each country tripping over itself as 
it rushes to make deals with sheiks and tribal chief tans. 
A powerful and united Africa and South America with 
the other producing nations of the world would be able 
to play with the West as a puppeteer with his puppets. 
Weak and squabbling. devoting all their resources to the 
maintainence of the peace at home, they could offer no 
effective resistance. If Henry Kissinger gets his way, the 
Western World will unite in opposition . the haves vs . 
the have nots, leading to a sharply divided world and 
the real possibility of world war . If the producing 
nations put the screw on. the Western World would 
have no alternative but submit or fight. Submit? Never. 

The " underdeveloped" nations will meanwhile pick 
out the best from Western technology, learning from 
our mistakes, and with any luck at all produce a more 
rational society, with technology as a tool instead of a 
master. They will be able to preserve what is best in 
their lands, without destroying it in the never-ending 
and mindless search for more comfort. faster cars. and a

and the dashln, freedom 
that the common woriting

Needless to say, they seek 
the advice of Â·eKperts . 
Therefore, Ferd, Chet and 
myself have sat down and 
poured over these 
questions. Today we will 
throw out some guidelines 
on the latest in jock living 
and wi II attempt to keep the

fine work in the annals of 
sports reporting by many 
philanthropic institutions 
among other things. Lately 
a trend has appeared 
among the type of 
questions we' ve been 
receiving lately. Simply put, 
people want to know how 
to act and look like a jock. 

This doesn't seem 
unreasonable in today's 

society. People nowadays 
are fashion conscious -
always wishing to wear the 
correct clothes and use the 
proper fork for the salad . 
Sports afficianados are no 
different and seek to 
become successful jocks or 
jock impersonators. After 
all, its the jock who seems 
to halle the women, the 
good times, the good looks 

Wrestlers Ruggers Take Two 

The first characteristic 
that meets the casual 
observer's eye is the jock's 
ability to enrapture women . 
This is somewhat a cyclic 
phenomena since the more 
successful a jock is at 
obtaining a harem of 
females, the higher up he 
moves on the hallowed 
ladder of jockdom and 
therefore, the more pull he 
has on women, ad nauseum . 
In a sense the Phrase 
"women breed women" has 
significance here since the 
more womem jock has 
around, the easier it is for 
him to get more.

After a raucous potluck 
dinner with the UCSD Lady 
Ruggen, the Men's Rugby 
Team took on crosstown 
rivals, San Diego State last 
Saturday. A week of frantic 
preparation preceeded this 
event, the potluck dinner 
that is, and Lance "The 
Worrier" Delong spent 
many sober hours trying to 
get the UCSD Ruggers to 
take seriously the over-
shifted defense that the 
Aztecs would use. Little did 
he know that a blinding 
fljlsh of brilliant coun-
terstrategy would be 
conceived in the wee hours 
of Friday morning while the 
chief strategist let his dogs 
out for a leak. 

Strategy or coun-
terstrategy the game clearly 
belonged to " Butterball " 
Cates, who had 
collaborated with the 
Aztecs on a special play last 
year (yielded two scores), 
carried on the tradition with 
three tries off of that play. 
The play usually begins 
around the 25 yard line 
when Gates steals a bob-
bled ball from the Aztec 
scrum half who has gotten a 
lousy pass from his forward . 
Cates then flattens the 
scrum half with a hip, 
swerves around the wing 
and dilles into the endzone 

This tournament will be a for a score. The Aztecs can

note you hear in many 
blues-based songs). He uses 
it in all types of situations, 
though; he'll floor you with 
some lightening-fast solo ' 
and then end abruptly on a 
vibrato note - the effect is 
unbelievable. Listen to 
Thirty Days (a Chuck Berry 
tune) off this album and see 
for yourself.. . 

Another thing ... Johnny 
Winter and Edgar Winter 
(his brother who adds some 
very effective keyboard and 
sax support on the album, 
especially on Feed-Back on 
Highway 101) are just about 
the most funky and soulful 
performers in the business 
today and you can't help 
but feel this when listening 
to this album . Every time 
Johnny belches a gutty 
"Rock On !" or ' "Yeah!" 
during or right before hi s 
dynamic solo breaks, he 
makes it hard for you to 
keep still. When not playing 
solos, he sets a funky hard-
driving pace for his songs .

Bad Luck Situation shows 
this admirably. 

Although he shows a step 
in the right direction on this 
album, Winter still has a 
ways to go in terms of 
lIersatility. It's very difficult 
for an accomplished 
guitarist to break out of aD 
established pattern of 
playing; he must constantly 
develop new ideas and 
deviations from the norm. 
By the time the album Still 
Alive and Wtll came out, 
one heard lIestiges of old 
solos from his previous 
albums; he seemed to be 
stuck in a rut. Well , the neKt 
album was going to be a 
crucial point in his 
recording career as far as 
his innovatille ability was 
concerned. He seems to 
have successfully eluded 
the monotonous Rod 
Stewart syndrome with this 
new album; there is suf-
ficient variation in guitar 
work and style to warrant 
praise and a hearty "carry 
on!"

the need to be alone. Under 
such circumstances, it is 
very healthy and fun to 
masturbate. If this is 
prevented by an irrational 
sentiment that mastur-
bation is perverted or 
childish, then either we will 
deny ourselves a seKual 
release that we may greatly 
crave, or we will seek out 
some person with whom we 
have little in common and 
take little real delight in 
(eKcept as a sexual outlet), 
and use this person's body 
as a masturbation aid . The 
process of maintaining such 
a relationship may involve 
considerable insincerity 
and repression of strong 
personal tastes. 
. Interpersonal sex is much 
more warm and meaningful 
when it is an eKpression of 
mutual delight and respect 
for the whole person . 
Unfortunately, it very often 
results instead from a desire 
to prove to oneself and 
others that one is a " real " 
man or " real " woman, and 
from a contempt and a fear 
for masturbation . Such 
superficia l relationships can 
provide fittle real security 
and promote an unhealthy 
dependence. 

In fairness, it should be 
admitted that in some cases

a too great reliance on 
masturbation can be 
harmful. A shy person 
whose only form of sexual 
release was auto-eroticism 
might be better off if the 
pressure of sexual desire 
were to lead him to make 
the eKtra effort to find a 
congenial partner . This, 
however, does not seem 
sufficient to justify a 
negative attitlJde toward 
masturbation. Rather, we 
should make certain that 
we realize that congenial 
interpersonal relationships 
are extremely delightful and 
may lead to great personal 
growth. Masturbation as the 
ultimate or single solution 
is unfortunate, and rarely 
necessary. 

On the other hand, many 
people would be more 
interesting and creative if 
they were able to tolerate 
more aloneness. This would 
be possible if they could 
masturbate without shame. 

In summary, if all forms 
of sexuality were respected, 
people would be more 
independent and could 
develop fuller, more unique 
characters, while at the 
same time the depth and 
range of interpersonal 
relationships would be 
enhanced. 

Freud felt that by its very 
nature society was 
repressille . (He would have 
done well to point out that 
"the state of nature" can be 
even more repressive, th-
warting desires for food, 
clothing, shelter, health, 
etc.) The goal of social 
organization should be to 
minimize repression : to 
maximize the chance for 
and appreciation of sensual 
and intellectual pleasures, 
to minimiZe drudgery, 
insecurity and paralyzing 

fears . Negative social at-
titudes toward any form of 
sex are severely repressive, 
and we would do well to rid 
ourseilies of them . 

Now, Mr. Caldwell , if you 
still find this farCical , I beg 
to know why. 

But I'll agree with you on 
one thing . This is a rotten 
newspaper . 

Green Valleys 
con\inued from page 5 

Nigerian tribesmen send 
Care packages when the 
Mississippi floods , and the 
Iraqi people send aid when 
San Francisco is lelleled by 
an earthquake. Do not 
begrudge these exploited 
lands their moment of 
glory : for they will do better 
than us, and feeding upon 
'pur carcas they will build a 
better world, even as the 
Western World fed upon 
the carcas of the Creeks. 

America will be 
destroyed by the very thing 
that she has touted as her 
finest asset--the absurd 
luxuries that so many deem 
to be necessities . The Eagl~ 
has flown too close to the 
sun, the lion has out-
smarted himself, and the 
Fleur-de-lis ha~ wilted . 
Africa will inherit the Earth ; 
may she do well by it. 

Budget 
neKt year totally by the 
Registration Fee Com-
mittee. All other papers, 
Ran de Bronce, Freedom 
and the North Star, would 
be funded by T.U .S.C. The 
cost would amount to 
about 52.75 per student per 

Rugby â¢â¢â¢ 
continued from page 6 

took it in for another score. 
Warren Stellens converted 
for a fi nal score of 10-4 
Tritons win . 

This week brings an 
historic first to UCSD and 
California Rugby with the 
first game between two 
women 's teams . The UCSD 
Women play Northridge at 
UC Irvine. The ladies have 
worked hard and have 
come to play a good and 
exciting quality of rugby. 
Their coaches have mar-
velled at the speed of their 
pick-tJp and moves both on 
and off the field . I n case 
you are wondering just who 
these ladies are, they can be 
seen wandering around 
campus on Friday cram-
ming butterfly nets into 
their stomachs. Should be a 
good one. 

Meanwhile the men 's 
teams also play at UCI 
against the Anteaters and 
Unicorns. 

continued from pilge one 

year. 
Anyone interested in 

these proposed allotments 
of student money should 
attend the T.U.S.C. meeting 
on Monday. As always t~e 
meetings are open to all 
students .
