Field te tll1g of the icc-nucleation 
mll1us-bacteria , known as "ICC 111 111 us," 
on potato plants will be cond ucted 111 
late spring at the UC lulelake Field 
Station in northern California, according 
to UC Berkeley scientists Steven Lindow 
and Nickolas Panopoulos, who head the 
expenment, 

The field tests will be conducted on a 
remOle experimental plot surrounded by 
a 30-foot bare soil buffer zone at the UC 
Tulelake fa ility, The half-acre plOl is 
withm a L02-acre parcel that is 
managed by the UC field station. 

The field testS , which arc expected to 
last up to six weeks, will be monitored 
by the u.s. Environmental PrOtec tion 
Agency (EPA) and UC personnel. 
SpeCial EPA sa mpling devices will 
monitor the air above and around the 
test plot to detect any ae rial movement 
of ba tena. UC pe rsonnel will monitor 
the ground movement of bacteria on 
insects and plants. and in so il and 
waler, wlthm and surrounding the test 
plol. 

After the test, the experimental plants 
Will be inci nerated on the site. None of 
the experimental plants will be used for 
food or feed purposes. The EIR 
estimates that 99,999 percent of th e 
bacteria hand-sprayed during the 
experiment wi ll remain within the 
boundaries of the test plot. 

The EPA granted a permit for the 
field test III May 1986. Field testing has 
been delayed since then to allow the 
University to respond to concerns 
raised by Tulelake residents regarding 
the potential health and environmental 
safety of the experiment and to provide 
information regarding the experiment to 
the publi c.

Arms control discussed 
By LETICIA VILLARREAL, Staff Writer 

"Nuclear weapons have made the world unsafe for war," George 
Rathjens, political science professor at Massachusells Institute of 
Technology (MIT), IOld his audience during Thursday's 
luncheon/seminar, The scminar was held by the Faculty Seminar 
on International Security and sponsored by thc Institute on plobal 
Conflict and Cooperation , Science Applications Imemational 
Corporation, and private individuals, 

In his discussion entitled "Views on the Value of Arms Control , 
Past and Present," Rathjens stressed that even a war' with 
conventional weapons was not "safe" because such a war would 
lI1evitably drive one nation involved to use its nuclear stockpile. He 
stressed that the size of a country's nuclear arsenal "docs not matter 

. as much as the relationship between it and another nuclear power," 
To clarify the point. Rathjcns noted that the United Kingdom could 
do cnppling damage to the United States in about 20 minutes with 
ItS nuclear capability, but: Americans do not worry about the United 
Kingdom because of the very stable relationship between the twO 
countries as compared \\.ith the Soviet Union , ' 

RathJens said he opposed President Reagan's Strategic Defense 
Initiative (S01) because it would lead world leaders to behave "as if 
nuclear weapons do not exist," and such bchavior is justiriable only 
if "the system is perfect, and SO! is nOl ," He acknowledged that SO! 
is a "very attractlve solution" but called it "a technical fix in an arena 
that require s another type of solution - a political solution." 
Howeve r, he did not see a political solution being reached between 
the United States and the USSR "anytime soon ," 

"I fi nd it ve ry hard to believe,Â· he added . "Without a change in 
political re la tionships, the United States and the oviet Union 
would agree to a total ban on nuclear weapons." 

In the questlon-and-answer session after his discourse, RathJens 
was asked under what speci fi c circumstances would he imagi ne a 
political agreement belJlg arriv;:d at by th e Untted ~tate and the 
Sovie t Union , He answe red , "I thll1k the latest eve nts in the US R

1987 editorial 
endorsements 

In the absence of a rruly diverse ballor, qualified candidates, and 
coherently worded referenda, it has been difficult at best for the 
Guardian staff to endorse any issue or candidate at all. 

With the exception of the presidential race and the college 
senators, aD of the candidates are running unopposed, as members 
of a single slate . This presents the problem of a single-Sided AS. 
government for the coming year which is decidedly conservative, 
lacking the ability (Q consider issues objectively. 

The Referenda are a bit more diverse, yet most are so poorly 
written that the true purpose of the proposals does not become 
apparent until they are dissected into their o~ginal components. A 
typical bureaucratic trick has been employed In several cases where 
two issues are combined into one in order to disguise the true 
purpose of the bill. 

Referendum 1 is an ambiguously worded proposal that 
essentiaDy limits the disbursement of UCSA funds to causes that 
"affect students as students." This particular item is worded in such 
a way that it is effected only if it is voted against. Some of our 
editorial board members were opposed to the enacanent of 
Referendum 1 because of the many ways students could (or could 
not) be affected as students. This could curtail funding to some very 
important causes simply because someone determines that the 
cause in question does affect the student body in a certain way. The 
idea behind the referendum is sound, however, and is valid when 
properly worded. The Guardian urges your 'no' vote on Referendum 
1 because an organization such as the UCSA is primarily obligated 
to deal with student issues and is not financially capable of 
involving itself in outside controversies. 

Referendum 2 is subjective to the wants and needs of the campus 
residents. Apparently, it will not cost the entire campus population, 
but only those who wish to have the service connected in their 
rooms. Its enacanent, however, is dependent upon an agreement 
made between the Housing Administration and the cable company 
that outfits the buildmgs. Nevertheless, the Guardian feels that 
Referendum 2 is a fair and adequate proposal, and urges a 'yes' vote 
on items A. Band C of Referendum 2. 

Referendum 3 proposes the eStablishment of study space 
available to students during times when libraries are closed. This is 
a- workable idea, provided security measures are upgraded 

r accordingly. The Guardian urges a 'yes' vore on Referendum 3. 
Referendum 4 is a logical amendment to the Constitution that 

will prevent the MacCrone fiasco of recent from occurring again. It 
essentiaDy states that a person removed from an A.S. office shaD not 
be eligible to return during that term. The Guardian endorses this 
amendment. 

Referendum 5 is by far the trickiest item this year. On the surface 
it appears to exchange a moderate increase in student fees for a 
Division III footbaD team. In reality, these funds will also be used to 
upgrade the entire UCSD intercollegiate spons program. 

evertheless, the Guardian suppons this proposal for both reasons, 
since the intercollegiate sports program is presently in need of

Uncontested contest 
By MARK SANDERSON, Associatt News EdUor 

Remember in high school when Biff Franklin, 
Pointdexter Le Beau and Suzy Meyers ran for student 
body office? The jocks voted for Biff, Pointdexttr 
received suppon from those with plastic pen cases 
and the remainder of the students endorsed Suzy 
because her parents allowed her to wear red lipstick 
and she filled her mohair sweater so,well ... 

The funny thing about high school was the way 
individuals were elected into office. For the most 
pan, it was a popularity contest, fueled by tightly 
organized cliques, whose members were identified by 
the tables they occupied during lunch. 

With the exception of the contests determining 
AS. President and college senators, every race is 
uncontested. In essence, this translates into a 1987-
1988 student government saturated with ASAP, 
candidates. This mayor may not be satisfactory, 
depending on who is voting. But regardless of 
candidate preference, the lack of individuals seeking 
office will only limit the democractic process. 

While we may want to believe, the election of next 
year's AS, officers will be decided with vOtes cast by 
educated, politically aware individuals, this may not 
be the case, Not because students didn't do their 
homework, but rather, students didn't have a choice. 

Sooner or later, the incoming AS. will pass 
legislation or misallocate funds inciting criticism 
from students. The blame for this cannot be placed 
solely on the AS. to be. The lack of alternative 
candidates on the current baBot is not the fault of 
those running. Only throU2h greater competition 
within each race could the student body have 
avoided an election where the an-important vote lost 
its power.

MacCrone's Friend 

Editor: 
For several years now I have 

been intimately involved with the 
A.S., including the Iast 'twO asJohn 
Muir College's Senior Senator. I 
have, for the most part, enjoyed my 
involvement with Student 
Government and hope that I rttay 
have effected some change for the 
better. 

When I walk away from the AS. 
in a few weeks and Muir and UCSD 
in June, I want to feel that the 
legacy' of strong AS. leadershIp 
established over the period from 
the Craig Lee days right through to 
the Alexander years will continue. 
This is why in the upcoming 
Associated Student elections, I ' 
plan to cast my vote for David 
Friend. 

I have known "Friendly" for four 
years now, and I hold a high degree 
of respect for him. He has an ability 
to motivate people and the drive to 
do more than spout off on key 
issues affecting student life - he 
acts on them! Dave shows sound 
judgement and has the moral 
strength to be a strong AS. 
President. 

David Friend will be a dedicated 
leader as A.S. President. 

-Gregory MacCrone 
Muir/AS, Senior Senator 

Another endorsement 

Editor: 
Being a leader reqUires a person 

to have a good sense of 
responsibiliry and commitment 
More and more of today's leaders 
are so wrapped up in the power of 
their position that they forget the 
responsibjlity and end up being 
figureheads doing nothing but 
basking in their own position. 

This is definitely not the 
description of Dave Marchick. 
Having shared an office with Dave 
this year, I have seen him work 
hard on the return of nickle, dime 
and quaner parking meters, 
meeting with student service 
rttanagers and asking them how he 
could help enterprises grow and 
become more successful. 

I have seen Dave work hard on 
the AS Finance Committee by 
asking key questions in order to 
make sure every AS. allocation is 
justified. 

I have heard Dave speak in A.S. 
council meetings representing his 
view and then listen anentively to 

others speaking their point of 
view. 

Dave has a tremendous sense of 
commitment and responsibility. 
His many accomplishments this 
year proves this. But more 
importantly, Dave has more goals 
that he wants to achieve for the 
student body, such as a parking 
shunle, TA training, creation of 
24-hour study halls. These and 
others are aU reasonable and 
atrainable goals. 

An effective AS. President must 
have three important skills: 
Budgetary, Communication and 
Leadership. Dave has experience 
and proven effectiveness in all 
these areas. 

I urge you [Q vote for Dave 
Marchick for A.S, President. Elect a 
responsible leader, not one who 
will take the position and the 
power, and not the responsibility.

dollars 10 be needed In those areas, 
as that is where the target 
diflerences appear in two budgets. 
Given the significant deficiency in 
UCSD's current football related 
equipment, facilities, and suppOrt 
staff, if the referendum were 
passed with a '&6.50/ quaner 
assessme nt , the athletic 
department can make no realistic 
Division III footbaU program. There 
are further questions in regards to 
facilities , office and storage space, 
and training and weight room 
areas that have yet to be addressed , 
which could reqUire Significant 
additional funds in the future . 
Consequently, it may take several 
years to accumulate sufficient 
funds to cover anticipated 
expenses . Additionally, the 
referendum question docs not 
define how much of the '&6.50 
would be aUocated to football and 
how much to eXisting sports.

sample ballot boasts a number of 
referenda to deal with peuy 
squabbles within the A.S. factions. 
At first glance, none of them seem 
to deserve a great deal of attention. 
But a second look reveals subtleties 
which could very easily serve to the 
detriment of UCSD students. A 
smooth auempt is being made to 
create division between students at 
this univerSit y and the 
communities we come from . We 
refer you to Referendum 1, UCSA 
Student Fee Funds and Resources. 

Referendum 1 appears to be an 
apolitical issue dealing with how to 
beSt use funds to maximize the 
benefits to students. But on close

be an interesting move on the parr 
of cert,lIn individuals (within the 
AS. hierarchy) 10 isolate students 
from their communities, the 
communities from which we 
receive rhe encouragement and 
support needed to make It here at 
this institution of higher learning. 
The referendum asks the voter 
whether or not suppon should be 
given for "funds and resources on 
issues which do not directly affect 
students as students." The 
ambiguous wording leaves this 
measure wide open 10 the 
interpretation and definition of 
individuals who will undoubtedly 
wind up in positions of power in 
the next AS. Council. Who will 
determine what issues "do not 
directly affect student s as 
students?" Will a war In Central 
America "not affect students as 
students]" In faCl, many srudents, 
if it comes to that, Will have to pay 
not only with their fees but also 
with their lives. We as students are 
Ultimately conneCled to San Deigo, 
the United States of America, 
America as a continent and the 
world. We do not lose contact with 
them just because we happen to be 
on campus. JUSt as we do nO! cease 
to become members of our falmlles 
when we leave home, so 100 we do 
nor Isolate ourselves from our 
communities by striving for a 
degree. The lIlle 'student' docs not 
sepamtc us from the society wh ich 
sustainS us. It docs not se paralc us 
from local issues such as the fight 
against drug abuse or police

strives ro auain such a scparallon. 
The proponents of dlvisiomsm are 
chOOSing to limit the ddinillon of 
tudent issues ro "registration fees, 

student wages and lab safety 
among others." Very few will argue 
that these topics arc not Important. 
But such limited definitions can 
easily serve to break the precIOus 
tics we ,IS budding intellectual 
leaders have with the people we 
come from. A 'no' vote on 
Referendum 1 would severely limit 
the definition of "issues that affect 
us direcdy." Such decisions would 
be made by a handful of 
individuals using their perry, 
personal interests as a reference. 
They could easily deCide on ,I 
whim that Alternative Media docs 
nor "directly affect students as 
students" and, with a stroke of a 
pen, eliminate a medium of 
communicallon students have 
overwhelmingly supported yea r 
after year. 

We urge all students to vote YES

intercollegiate sports and establish 
a DiviSIOn III Football Program ," I 
fecI it important as Director of 
Athletics 10 share with UCSD 
slUdents the potential viabiliry of 
this '!i6.50 fee . 

I wholeheartedly suppOrt the 
question of whether UCSD should 
cnter the football arena being 
decided by UCSD students. While 
football might bring new 
excitement and spi rit to the 
campus, there have been other 
pros and cons presented in paSt 
Guardiall issues on this ropic. I 
prefer 10 not be repetitious, but 
rather to express a strong concern 
of the athletics department which 
ultimately would be charged with 
the responsibility of operating the 
program. If a football program is to 
be developed at UCSD, the 
referendum question have 
suggested that '&6 .50 fee would 
allow for fund ing a football 
program as well as supplementing 
existing sports teams. Based on the 
extensive research that my staff 
and I have done and our best 
profeSSional judgement, we don't 
believe that the S6.50/ quarter 
proposed assessment would cover 
annual operating expenses for 
football , nor additionally allow for 
funds to be directed to other spons 
teams' needs. 

It IS my understanding that the 
budget whi h was developed by 
the athle tics qaff has berr n:\ lsed 
by the proposers f the rcfcn-ndum

are supposed to be imellectual. 
Instead of stompmg on 
newspapers WIth thell feet , th"y 
should be fighting Ideas WIth 
Ideas."' 

In the form of alrernallvc 
media, students at UCSD ha\'(: 
been gIven the opporruntt), to be 
exposed and to expo~e other, to 
dlfTerent way of thtnkmg. These 
Ideas can vary sharply from the 
left-wtng liberalism of the nell' 
mdrcalar to the extreme nnlht_ ,,,-
wing conserval1 m of the 
Califanll!1 ReVIew. Due to 
their widely varying comem, 
these publications offer stu-
dents an alternative to the rradl-
tional forms of media such as the 
San Diego Union or the LosAngele.\ 
Times. 

Va:: Franren;:a , a ne\\'spape r 
that has been dIstributed .1"1 
campus and throughout an 
DIego for rwelve years, USl:, ldeas 
to unt[(' ChIcanos Mcx lcano, nn 
the campu, wllh those In 'he 
community. Although IhlS ethntL 
group makes up 25 percent of 
the population in thIS state the\' 
represent only J percent of the' 
stud_ent body at UCSD. 

As MIguel Chavez, edItor o( 
1'0:: Fran lcn::a . sa Id, "We as a 
people arc nOl given the same 
opporrunlties as evel)'one else. 
We're not gIven the ame 
education. I don't want to narrow 
our scope to Just here at the 
unIversity We arc student s here 
but we're wrtting for a much 
broader scope If you go down to 
th e bamo and ask people if 
they've heard of the Guardwn , 
they're gomg to say, 'What?' But 
if you a k them If thcy've heard 
of Vaz Franlenw , you're gOtng to 
get a 'yes' and they've probably 
read it too. We are trying to 
connect the community with the 
university ." 

By combtning local Issues WI th 
the national and tnternatlonal 
spectrum, Chavez feels that Va:: 
Fron teriza is not Just limited to 
Chicanos but IS also a tool for 
educating students who have 
only been exposed to stereotypes 
created by the media. 

"We're trying to get tn touch 
with the reality of our sltuatton 
here ," Chavez Said "We're trytng 
ro cover all the Issues tn a way 
that we're not perpetuating the 
fantasy that's spread by 
mainstream new papers. I'm not 
saytng we're nOt political W~ 
arc. But If you looked at the 

\ 
\ 

hIstory of \10:: rl'!JllCl' riZll , you 'd 
sec that we've always fought 
racism and te reotypes 
intellectually." 

While Vo~ Frol1(enza focuses 
on Issues that relate to a speclftc 
group on campus and in the 
community, the llew IndIcator has 
prOVIded studems with a Itberal 
point of view sInce 1968 when It 
fIrst appeared as th e offiC Ial 
campus newspaper. Arter being 
replaced by the Tntan TlIll e~, 
whl h eventually became the 
GuardIan, th e new Indlwlar has 
earned a reputation for st ruggling 
agamst the admllllstnlllOn and 
the AsSOCIated Students (A.S .) as 
well as coveri ng comroverslal 
political Issues th ,lt most 
students a re not usually expo,ed 
to. 

As joe Watnlo. a se nIor st.lfI 
writer for th e IIL'W Indltc1lOr, 
stated, "I feci that the IIl'W 
IlIdlcator IS il propagand a lDol 
also thtnk the Sail DIego! U IIIOII IS 
a propaganda tool I work (or the 
Il fW IlIdlWllll' because It put~ out 
the ktnd of prop.lgand" tha t 
most pcople aren 't exposed to 

the opportunity to be heard 

vel)' often. I thlllk they should 
be . I believe that the way people 
thmk comes from sOC Ietal 
influences whIch arc almost 
enmely capllali stic right now. 
Without newspapers like this . 
there's almost no wa9 different 
pOInts are gomg to be heard ." 

Although he stressed that staff 
writers for the new IIIdicatol' 
va ried with their ideological and 
political beliefs, WaInio 
malmatned that most of the 
writers arc SOCialists who belIeve 
that there needs to be some 
drastic changes within our 
soc Iety. WhIle most o( the recent 
edi tions of the newspaper deal 
with International issues, the 
newspaper IS currently tlytng to 
shdt its locus to cam pus and 
local Issues 

"I thInk .IS il campus 
newsp,lper. we should gIve a 
radIcal or pmgrcs II'C perspective 
01 th lng, that arc happcnlllg 
hele ." Willntn reflecteu "Too 
lllten thl> )'ear, I feel th,lt we 
h.lVe I haul too man)' 
I ntern.ltlon,ll I>~ue, We'rc 1l)'lng 
III get more mgant':l'!.l " 

Yet attempting to restrict 
arllcles to local issues can be 
frustrating, as lIew IPIdicatar staff 
wri ter Craig ailing conceded, 
"As a socia li st, it's a lot more fun 
to write about Nicaragua than to 
think about UCSD." 

At the other end of the 
politi cal spectrum is th e 
California Review, a decidedly 
right-wing newspaper which 
prides itself on its devotion to 
patriOtIc capitalism. 

As Kun A. Schlichter, a 
Ca lijortlw RfI'lfw staff wmcr, 
stated, "We like to thi nk of 
ourselves as a refreshi ng 
alternative to the Other 
newspapers and group on 
campus. We arc absolutely ,lIld 
unshakably prn-Amenc'lIl and for 
freedom of free enterpnse . 1 have 
always been extremely patriotIC 
and pretty nght Wtng. I also like 
to wme, so thi S WilS natura II}' the 
place to come." 

Although It'S con~e lvatl \'e 
coment has sometimes been 
crItiCIzed a5 sexl>t clnd mC"t 
wmer, for the C" II/on ll(/ RCI'Il'1V 

insist that theIr newspaper is a 
neces ary contrast to the liberal 
a!Illude that tends to prevail at 
UC D. 

Editor P. jo~eph Moons saId , 
"I talk to ,I lOt o( people 01T

busIIle5smen anu community 
leadl'rs feel that thIS school has

The People 's VaILe , a 
~ newspaper for Afro. 

American stUdents 
also serves as an 
alternative to 

mainstream opinions, but 
for entirely different reasons. 

DIstributed on campus and 
Southeast San Diego, 

the newspaper is written by several 
stUdents with a collective 
edItorship. LIke Voz FronlCl1za, 
the People ', \ '[)/(~ IS ta rgeted 
toward a speCIfic group while 
hoptng to reach aU students 

As staff wmer Abasi Mudada 
stated , -We need to educate 
people. The newspaper is mainly 
for African students, but it's really 

for all human beings. People 
the information in our 
ne'VSlllaoc~r which has 

Itln,n~llv been 
ignored on this 

campus. They have 
always tried to keep us 

ignorant of the past. We 
sec this as a tool to free 

our people's minds." 
L'Clwyit1l . a quanerly 

newspaper which tries to reach 
rhe Jewish population at UCSD, 
also sees Ilself as Important to 
rhe group It rep resents while 
covering many global issues that 
face the JeWIsh community. 
L 'Chc.rYlt1l also tries to deal wi th 
problems anLi issue that tnvolve 
students. 

"It 's reaUy a chance (or Jewish 
students to say what they want 
to say," Mi cah Barany, assistant 
editor, asselled . "L'Chc.ryit1l is 
reaUy a forum to express 
differem opi nions. A lot of us 
have very different perspective 
on different issues and 1 think 
that's true of JeWIsh students. 
They have very wide opinion..~ . 
The lIew IIldlcator sometimes 
attacks us rather unfairly and 
tries to put us in the same 
category as the Californta Review." 

Although admitti ng that the 
current writers tend to be 
conservative, the editors of 
L 'CllQyinl argue that their paper 
will print any optnion and wants, 
to give all stud ents the 
opponunity to express theIr 
views. 

Barany added, "I think the 
newspaper is leaning toward the 
co nservati ve VIew point right 
now, but It'S more or less the

Referendum 6 proposes a $1 .00-

Dear Student', 

There's something you can do for a short time each day that will improve 
every aspect of your life-your 
grades, your future career, your 
relationships, everything- all at 
the SlIme time. What's more, it's 
easy to do. Over 1,000,000 stu-
dents have experienced the bene-
fits. And you can too. 

You'Hlearn about it soon at 
a special free lecture on the 
Transcendental Meditation tech-
nique, and regardless of what 
you've already heard about TM, 
this entertaining lalk will surprise 
and enlighten you. More than 
thaI, it may well change your life. 

My name is Kevin Blair. I'm 
president of the student govern-
ment at Maharishi Internalional 
University , where students, fac-
ulty, and staff all practice the TM 
technique. I want to tell you three 
things about the upcoming lecture: 

1 At the lecture, you'Hlearn how the simple, natural TM technique, which is practiced 
for IS-20 minutes twice a day, 
brings profound benefits to mind 
and body, and how these benefits 
automatically improve one's social 
behavior, school and job per-
formance, and much more. 

Scientific Research 

2 You' ll also learn about the vast amount of scientific research Ihat's been done on 
TM (more than 350 studies 
worldwide over the past I S years) . 

If you really want 
to know how to 
improve your grades, 
your career, and 
your life, there's an 
upcoming lecture 
you shouldn't miss. 
And you'll learn that a lot of the 
research findings are directly rele-
vant to your personal and aca-
demic development as a student. 
Here, for example, is a partial list 
of the research results in the field 
of education: 
â¢ increased intell igence 
â¢ improved comprehension, 

concentralion, and memory 
â¢ increased learning abililY 
â¢ increased speed in solving 

problems 
â¢ increased creativilY 
â¢ broader comprehension and 

ability to focus attention 
â¢ improved academic 

performance 
â¢ reduced stress and anxiety 
â¢ decreased use of drugs, 

alcohol, and cigarettes 
â¢ increased happiness 
â¢ improved relationships lIt-

tween students and reachers 
â¢ improved mind-body 

coordination 
â¢ improved athletic performance 

Now, I'm sure you'd like to 
have some of those Qualities grow-
ing in your life. Well you can. 
And the beautiful thing is that 
these qualities grow naturally. 
simply as a result of practicing the 
TM technique. 

World Pellce 

3 Finally, if you are con-cerned not just with your own future, but also the 
future of our nation and the 
world, there's even more reason 
to attend the lecture. 

This is because the TM tech-
nique doesn't just help the in-
dividual. The coherence generated 
when people practice TM extends 
to society as a whole. Research has 
shown Ihat when as little as the 
square rool of one percent of a 

population practices the TM pro-
gram and ils advanced aspects, the 
entire populalJon becomes more 
orderly, peaceful, and progressive.

This "Super Radiance Effect" 
has been demonstrated in commun-
ities, cities- even entire nations. 
This brings great hope for the 
future, because it means that the 
age-old problems of world peace 
may at last have a solution. 
It Works! 
. I f you're wondering how one 

simple technique can bring 
so many benefits to mind, 

body, behavior, and even the world 
as a whole, I urge you to attend the 
free leclure. The explanation you'll 
hear is at once simple, scientific, 
and profound.

You'll hear. for example, about 
the unified field of all the laws of 
nature as described by modern 
physics and by ancient Vedic 
science. And about how the TM 
technique lets you experience I he 
umfied field within your own con-
scIousness . And about how that exÂ· 
perience, gained regularly, 
brings you the support of all the 
laws of nature .

The main thing, however , is 
that TM works. I know from my 
own experience. J've been practicÂ· 
ing the lechnique for 6 years, and 
ils made me more relaxed. yel 
more dynamic and productive. As 
a result, I'm enjoyi ng greater suc-
cess-both in and out of the 
classroom! 

Of course, whether you sIan the 
TM technique or nO! is up to you. 
But doesn't il make ense to al

TM proves to be true, think what 
it could mean jor your achieve-

hope you'll be there, and 
don't hesitate to bring

5. lnteroolleaiate Athletic:a 
Uparade & Football Referendum 

The University of California, San 
Diego's Intercollegiate Athletic 
Philosophy states that because of vast 
diversity of UCSD's athletic program 
it is unrealistic to suppose that 
adequate finances will ever be 
available to support all of the 
programs in their entirety. Because of 
this philosophy, many of the Inter-
collegiate athletes are forced to pay 
for their equipment and travel costs, 
sometimes amounting to hundreds of 
dollars. 

In addition, the administration of 
UCSD has determined that in order 
to establish an Intercollegiate Football 
Team at UCSD, a referendunl must 
be passed by the students specifically 
stating an increase in student fees in 
order to finance the football program. 
As a result of this increase, all 
students will be admitted to home 
football games without admission 
charge. 

If passed, the funds generated by 
the referendum below will be used to 
upgrade UCSD's intercollegiate sports 
programs and to establish a Division 
1II Football Program. 

Do you support an increase of 
$6.50 per quarter in the "Rec Facility 
Fee" effective Fall Quarter 1987, to 
be administered by the Director of 
Athletics on approval of the 
Intercollegiate Athletic Advisory 
Board to further finance the existing 
Intercollegiate Sports and establish a 
Division 111 Football Program? 
YESD NOD 
6. Coop referendum 
Do you approve of an increase in the 
current University Center Fee by 
$1.00 (one dollar) per quatter per 
student; locked in to specifically pay 
for a Coop Administration Staff and 
to facilitate the expansion of existing 
on campus student-run cooperatives 
and the establishment of new UCSD 
student run cooperatives.

Vice President Administrative 

David Manheim 
A,SAP Slate 

The office of Vice President Administration requires the 
attention of someone who understands the workings of the 
Associated Students Council and possesses strong leadership 
qualities. This person must have organization skills and a 
personality which enables him to guide the Council and the AS. 
through a su cessful school year. I feel I have these necessary 
attributes to allow me to serve as the best V.P.Administration for 
1987-88. 

I am presently Warren Collegejunior Senator and serve on the 
AS. Finance Committee. I was Warren College representative to 
the Student Organization Finance Board for two years and am 
chair of the AS Ad-Hoc Parking Committee. My work on these 
committees has given me inSIght to the workings of the AS, I 
have seen a need and desire for increased cultural programming 
which I will strive towards attaining next year, I will also strongly 
encourage Third World Students to apply for A.5. appOinted 
positions to enhance their campus wide representation. My 
mO!ivation and experience on Council will enable me to 
represent all students and encourage those who arc 
underrepresented, to get more involved in the AS, 

I believe that I have the qualifications and ideas, oupled with 
the skill, desire, and committment to ensure the fluid operation 
of the Council. A vote for me is a vote for strong leadership in a 
forward direction, 

Vice President External 

Jill Man:hick 
ASAP, Slate 

The office of Vicc President of External Affairs requires the 
knowledge of issues which effect students on the state, national 
and local level. This year I was Executive lobby Director of 
External Affairs. I have become very knowledgeable on all issues 
that concern students. As lobby Director my main objective was 
to educate students on current issues such as financial aid, SDI, 
and candidate forums. I feel that I have done my job effectively. I 
plan to continue thiS if elected. 

Another problem which I hope to excell is the San Diego 
County Collegiate Council. This program will unite the 
Universities and Community Colleges and have their opinions 
known to offiCials In the San Diego area. 

One issue which I feel needs more visibility is financial aid , l 
promise if elected to work on educating students as well as 
legislators on the problems of finanCial aid and try to And a 
solution to our problems 

I feci that in chOOSing to run on A AP.,I have and chosen to 
run with the most qualified candidates. Although there were 
many personal considerations involved with this decision I feel 
that running with Dave Friend and the A.5AP. slate was a wise 
one. 

Vice President Finance 

'Roben Frankl 
ASAP. Slate 

As a candidate for the AsSOCiated Students Vice President of 
Finance, I feel that my organtzational skills and my current 
background arc the necessary quahties for this position, This 
AS. official must have the foreSight to evaluate yearly student 
organization budgets, give knowledgeable input on where 
Activity Fce Funds would best be spent, and to advise the 
President and Council on all financial matters. 

I am presently manager of the AS. Grove Caffe. and AS. 
Federal Director for the lobby Annex. My work in both these 
fields has given me Insight into the working of the Associated 
Srudents. Maintaining the most successful AS, Service on 
campus, the Grove Caffe, enables me to gain experience in 
handling a large yearly budget, while the lobby has exposed me 
to a variety of issues and individuals in a working atmosphere. 

With these qualities in mind. I feel that I could perform the 
duties ofV.P. of Finance, I would also have the strong working 
relationship with David Friend and the ASAP. slate which is 
necessary for a cohesive A.5. 

Academic Attairs Commissioner

As Commissioner of Academic Affairs,john Steinhouse hopes 
to ,"crease the amount of Input' lhat students have in the vital 
areas of faculty tenure and T A [raining. Hc funher hopes to be

Communications Commissioner 

Steven Tauber 
ASAP, Slate 

After a year and a half at UCSD, I have developed a great 
interest and motivation for our alternative media. NOI only is the ' 
altemative media valuable because it provides an open [orum for 
all views, but it is valuable because it gives our University 
something unique from other schools in the country. I, therefore, 
have always felt that there must be a continuation and ex pansion 
of the alternative media whenever appropriate, It is for thai 
reason that I decided to become a member of the Media Board, 
My year of Media Board experience combined with my skills as a 
group leader and moderator will enable me to accomplish my 
three goals as your 1987-88 A.5 . Commissioner of 
Communicatlons. My first goal is 10 continue the funding of the 
existing media, while encouraging Iheir self sufficiency and the 
creation of new media. I would also like to expand KSDT as an 
alternative medium that can beneAt the entire student body in 
addition to the members of the organization. Finally, I would like 
to implement an innovative program. By working with the 
CommUnications department I plan to obtain a UCSD 
broadcasting segment on a local television station. So please 
remember on April 7th, 8th and 9th to VOle [or Steven Tauber for 
Commissioner of Communications and for the ASAP. Slate. 

Programming Commissioner 

Parentheses Devers (PO) 
A,SAP,Slate 

Cutting Edge: Many people talk about it , yet few people attain 
it. I plan to establish this idea as the norm for UCSD 
entertainment. Today the programming provided is good, but it 
is limited, This could be remedied by sparking student interest 
through more major events and encouraging more cultural and 
artlstic programming. It is time now to create and promote 
events that fill the missing entertainment VOId. For example, 
creating events such as Reggae-Fest, which I am beginning to 
plan now. would promote the expansion of other Cultural 
events, Although it is Anancially unrealistic to get "A" bands such 
as U2 or Peter Gabriel. frequent performances by "B" bands such 
as The Bangles, Lone Justice, and the Untouchables are possible. 
With recognition from bigger bands and outside sponsorships, a 
UCSD open-air ampitheatre could become a reality with zero 
student funding As a Muir House Advisor for two years, 
commuter board programmer for one year, and planner of the 
Halloween Carnival. I feel I have gained the necessary 
programming experience to implement new and beller 
programs for the whole campus and PUt UCSD on the 'Culling 
Edge" of College Entertainment. 

Commissioner of Public Relations 

Claudia Cole 
ASAP. Slate 

The ASAP slate is a group 01 qualified and determined 
individuals who are willing 10 put your concerns into action. By 
allOWing an entire slate to come into office, srudent leaders 
would be elected who have already proven they can work 
together and come to agreements on Important issues. 

I have chosen to run on the ASAP slate because I see in all ofits 
members the experience and drive that I see I myself. As a Visual 
An/Media Major,l have received inSight on how to improve the 
Public Relations position. This past year I have worked with the 
present commissioner serving as Vice-Chair on the A.5. Public 
Relations Committee. This has given me hands on experience 
which I can apply if elected, 

My goals include, expansion of the AS. newspaper, I would 
like to have it published rwice a quarter, making it more 
complete, and increasing pUblicity of A.5. Council projects. 

Presently, the A.5, maintains the kiosks throughout campus, I 
would hke 10 designate one, centrally located to the promotion of 
student social functions. 

By collaborating with the Guardian I would like to form a 
column where students would submit questions regarding 
current issues. By addressing individual's questions, the entire 
student body would be informed about student concerns. 

These ideas can be put into motion ifl am slecled. I, as well. as 
the ASAP slate have the desire. committment, and experience to 
insure their completion.

members of the UCSD community who tend to spend their 
weekends intoxicated. FUllhermore, I am vice chair of the Sun

will push for a student run credit union, proViding the highest 
possible interest rates and the lowest possible loans . 
Furthermore, steps Will be made to create a word-processing

Revelle Senior Senator 

I'm Claire Mollard and am running for Revelle Senior Senator. 
Since coming to UCSD I have been involved with the Revelle 
Curriculum Review Board and the Revelle Apartment 
Programming Board. I'm currently the RevellejuniorSenator and 
this year have worked with the A.$ , Academic Affairs Office, 
reviewing the problems of foreign T.A.'s and holding a forum 
with srudents, T A's, and administrators to identify and deal 
with somc of those problems. I also worked with the 
Commissioner of Public Relations as an editor of the AS, 
Bulletin. Over the !\cxtyear I would like to continue workingwith 
both the AcademiC Affairs and Public Relations Offices on the 
headway and projects started this year. A new project I'd like to 
take on is the installatioon of an Activites and Party Information 
Board at Revelle, where students can both advertise and look for 
events happening on and off campus. 

My deciSion to run for Revelle Senior Senator stems from my 
previous involvement with Revelle committees and activitles. My 
experience on Revelle College Council gives the opponuniry to 
work closely with administrators and staff of Revelle. This, in 
addilion to serving on the Revelle Curriculum Review, ha~ 
exposed me to Revelle's structure, policies and needs. Serving on 
AS, as Revelle Senior Senator would entail maintaining close ties 
with Revelle and the A.S. Council. This office would enable me to 
bring about services that directly benefit you, the srudent at 
UCSD. In asking for your suppOrt, consider my interests and 
qualifications, I feci that with the use of my confidence and 
experience, I would be a very benefiCial addition to the Student 
Body as Revelle Senior Senator. 

Revelle Junior Senator 
My dectslon to run for RevelleJunior ~enator stemmed from 

my concern for the needs of studcnts at UCSD. Thus one of my 
main objectives is to work closely with the students at Revelle 
and the other colleges, and to represent lheir views m the AS. 
Also, I would like to maintain c10sc tics between the AS, and 
Revelle College CounCil. Some of the major issues of student 
concern that I will focus on include the parking problem, 
financial aId, and on-campus employment wages, Another major 
issue is the alcohol policy. I will Slnve to program alternate 
activities for on-campus reSidents such as cultural events, 
concertS, speakers, and weekend and evening events. The rwo 
major goals I have are to uphold the Tipsy Taxi Service, and 
expand the lecture Notes Servlce to include more classes. I have 
had expericnce which qualifies me for thiS position, I was 
appOinted 10 the Revelle judicial Committee rwo years; J was an 
officer in the Hall Programming Advisors during my Freshman 
Year; and I am currently the Vice-Chair of the Revelle Apartment 
Programming Board, I have been very involved in Revelle College 
Programming and Government. I would now like to extend this 
involvement to the AS I am a very hard worker and am very 
cnthuslastic about the prospect of working with students as 
Revelle junior Senator. 

Muir Senior Senator 
It's easy to run for a position such as MUir ~enior Senator by 

making a lot of promises, shaking a lot of hands, and trying to 
save the world at the same time. I feci that the best way to run for 
any position on AS. IS to possess cenain qualities such as 
knowledge, visibility, and experience, These characteristics, 
along with committment, arc something I feci I possess and can 
expand upon while represenllng Muir, 

I have acqUired an understanding of the administrative 
system whilc serving as member of the Registration FceAdvisory 
Committee. I have served on the Pops Events Committce for twO 
years. I have had frequent interation with staff. administrative, 
and student leaders, as well as IUden! organizations and 
enterprises. My objective IS to effectively represent and voice the 
concerns of students in general and Muir students in particular.

I am running for MUir JUnior Senator wuh the objective of 
Improving the student's life, here, at UCSD. I feci that by belOg 
the direct commUnicator between MUir and the other colleges I 
Will have a unique ch~nce to not only promote the umficollion of 
all the colleges. As a Â·tudem I am especiall}' concerned with the

the Isolation of the separate colleges. As a senator I would like to

Erik Neilsen 
ASA.P, Slate 

Progress, I'd hke to sec some more here at UCSD, Although I 
was very active In studcnt government throughout high schoo!. I 
wasn't certam what difference I could make here at UCSD, and at 
MUir 10 particular. I have nO!lced that much publicity has been 
given to the shortcomings and mishaps of the AS" such as the 
MacCrone case. We must reahze that a progressive government 
fmds its baSIS In cooperation - an elTo rt [hat Is'facilltated by a 
senator's role as a Hason be[ween srudents and their c1cClcd 
leaders. Aside from vaTious projects that I have In mind, my maIO 
goal IS to show MUIr students the Importance of their views and 
ideas As MUIr Sophomore Senalor, I plan 10 represent these 
views effectively by utihzmg my extensive expenence and 
enthUSiasm and by remaining aware of studenl concerns. 
Remember, a [ion and progress arc the result of cooperation and 
communication 

I'm john Robison and I am asking for your support Jrt [he MUir 
Sophomore enator race , My early expeTience as [he Muir 
Freshman Senator In the A.5 . Council. the MUir CoUege Counci!' 
and MUir Judi lal Board, [he A.S. Rules Committee, and SUI[C 
representation on the donn level arc perfect qualiflcallons for 
this job 

My expenence IS backed by a srrongdedlcallon as well Of the 
above aeitlvlles, I have had perfect attendance m evety actlVl[y, I 
am currently working on a Parking solu[ion, Cable TV In the 
dorms, and a cheaper new textbook alternative to our current 
Bookstore, On the MUIr level I actively support oon Concerts, 
Icc Cream SoCIals, Commuter activllles, and the extensive 
programming put on by MUIr College I encourage your Input 
and support at the polls and throughout the year. When you 
VOle" ,\'O[e John Robison for MUir Sophomore Senator 

Third Junior Senator 

To ensure that the needs of Third College Will be mel firsl and 
foremost above all OIher pnoTitles 

Bnefiy put. that IS my purpo~e 

I am concerned With the long lerm growth of the universilY 
and the abllllY of the AS to proVide cruCial selVlces, Th IS is 
espeCially Important 10 relation to deCiSIOns about the eXisting 
student center and the new University Center. Students must 
have the opuon to control or manage new selVices on OUt 
campus, Another concern I have is wllh regards to Affirmatlv( ' 
Action The five year plan set out goals that UCSD has yet td 
meet I also ~ee thiS problem With student government as the 
ethniC diverSity of our campus IS not re flectcd In the AS. 
Although SAAC has an ex-efflc'o member on the councll, l assert 

thl~ IS not enough and propose the SMC representative have a 
vOle on counCil. 

I am a member of Third College Jud icIal Board. and also the 
AS, Lobby Annex. I am active In the Third oUege Freshman 
Onentallon; I know thiS expertence WIU help me to represm 
Third and its JUniors. 

Warren Senior Senator 

Courtney Simpson 
The Independents 

l. Wiliam Costigan, am running for the position of Warren 
Scmor Sendtor There are mJny programs which I Wish 10 
implement to re medy some of the problems of Ihe AS, and 
Warren ollege Flrstly, l would try to bring Warren CoUege out 
of the seclUSIOn and Into Ihe ce mer of AS. events, In the pasl 
Warren ha~ been seemingly neglected from university evems, 
and therefore, a bndge needs [0 be made to bnng Warren 
tOgcther wilh the resl of UCSD. I also would start programs 
which would grearer publicize opportunllies available for 
gradualing se niOrs, For [00 long vital Information on what to do 
after graduation has been passed up due to lack of publlCJ[Y and 
organization, The opportunities arc out there, all we need IS the 
leadership to bnng Ihem OUt in the open, I feel wuh my past 
experience in the A.5. and fwO years on W A.G., along With my 
present work on the Rec/ Football Referendum and an optimistic 
attitude will enable me to make a positive difference for Warren 
as well as UCSD. 

Thank you 

I'm Courtney Simpson and I am running for Warren College 
enator I am majoring in Politlal Science and Economics and 

have had experience workmg with theASUCSD Lobby as weill as 
With the Registration Fcc Committee. I feel that I have the over all 
qualifications, and more importantly, the desire [0 beSI represem 
the interesls and needs of the Warren College Community. My 
desire, however, is [0 incorporate the interests of Ihe Warren 
College constltuems wilh those imereslS of UCSD studems as a 
whole Specifically I would A) like [0 sUppOrt oral examination as 
d prereqUisite f:Jr TA.shlps; B), advocate a shuttle [0 travel from 
the parking lots and around [he penphery of campus; C) 
increase support for recreation facilities for Intra murals as well as 
intercollegiate athletiCS; D) work against further changes In Ihe 
alcohol poliC}' that aim to elimina[e beer a[ T.G.'s as well as beer 
sponsored school evenlS. Remember. your vOle Will help me to 
help you. 

Warren] unior Senator 

Cris Rys 
No Shaft Slate 

My name IS Cris Rys, and I've been the Warren Sop homore 
Senator since january. In that time peTiod and before, I have 
been working on gClling more support for Intercollegiate 
Athletics .. speCifically a DIVISion III Football team 

I urge all of you who read [his to vote for the Athle[ic 
Upgrade/ Foolball Referendum not only of the good it will do for 
our Intercollegiate program and school spirit It will promote but 
for the idea of a "rcal" student government. This is our chance, 
the students, to actually have a say 111 the way that UCSD is run 
and not be shafted around by UCSD's administration. 

Too often students arc shafted around by the adminls[ralion. I 
feel It is WCSG's and ASUCSD's duty to stop [hiS, by means of 
stu d~nt protcStS, boycotting classes, or anything. jusl to takc a 
stand and fight for It, no bullshit pawn of the administration, 

Warren Sophomore Senator 

80b Bellerue 
Write-In Candidate 

If elected to Ihe office of Warren College Sophomore Senator,l 
plan to bctter hfc on the Warren Campus as much as pOSSible. 
~y threc goab arc . to PUt a III Baskctball court ncar \Varren 
Apartments, to construct an extended-hour sundry store close to 
the Apartments (for all those late night munchies), and finall)', to 
gCt vcnding mach Illes on the grounds of the Apartments, 

I havc spem tWO quarters In the AssOCiated Student's Office as 
ASSistant Slate Director for the Lobby, and through that group I 
have studied vanous student Issues such as fmanclal aid, 
Jffirmative action , and defense research m our UCSD Ltbs as 
well as problems of Warren College, I feel that all of these Iss'ues 
Will makc me an expenenced and knowledgeable Scnator, who 
IS looking OUI for Ihe bcst IntercslS of hiS college. 

My name IS Bob Bcllerue and I am runmng for the posillon of 
WalTen Sophomore Senator. 

The University environment IS a very important onc for it IS 
Ihe stamng point for the many careers and opportunities thm 
,1\vau us. But Without students there is no Universlt)' ThiS IS why 
I feel that thc vOice of the Student body should be the only 
relevant voice on campus Whethcr it is for the continuanon of 
JllOhol ,elVmg TG's or agamsl Ihe Implement3110n of a college 
football program, the important pomt IS th,1[ the ,tudent opinion 
I> the only op lOlon considered. In a democracy like ours, where 
Sim ple majoTlt)' rules, It IS always hard [0 get fair representation 
for all groups, But I aSsure evclyone of you that your Issues will be 
addressed Now I know that IS qUitC a leat, but I am sure that If we 
come IOgether and work for available solutions we can work 
dllng> OUI and make everyone happy, 

Now that I've had my say I hope t hm when Election lime 
come~ around you will make Ihe right t holce: Wrue- In Bob

Crew Classic, and classic it was.

put one boat in the finals by 
winning their first heat, while the 
other boats finished fourth and 
fifth in their heats. 

The women's novice team 
qualified Friday afternoon by 
narrowly edging the Santa Barbara 
Rowing Club. 

UCSD got off well in the finals. 

Womens' coach Linda Lyman 
was satisfied with her team's 
accomplishments. "We're on 
course for what we want to do 
We've advanced over the past two 
weeks." Lyman hopes to improve 
more than the ' competition. ThIS 
week her heavyweights pIcked up 
ten seconds on a team they raced 
two weeks ago. "That doesn't mean 
they're getting worse, it means 
we're getting better " she said. They 
are working hard to Improve.

six days a week and weighl 
training for four. "What we lack In 
size we make up for in heart: 
Lyman said. 

The teams are now geating 
towards the San Diego Regatta, also 
know as the "klOgs and queens of 
the bay," on Saturday. Apnl 18 in 
East Mission Bay, Competition will 
be between UCSD, SDSU and USD 
as well as some other rowing clubs. 
Lyman said the competition will be 
fun because "we share the same 
boathouse and train side-by-side 
every day." It's a local grudge 
match. 

The mer 's lightweight team missed qualifying by less than half a second. 

"We heard there were bad starts in 
previous races and prepared to 
stan from a count down," 
explained Coxwain Moore UCSD 
held second place for the fi rst 500-
700 meters but were passed by San 
Diego State, UCLA. an Santa 
Barbara. Their fifth place finish 
was the best of the da}' by the 
Tritons. 

The big winners Saturday were 
Harvard, who took the Mens 
Copely Cup, and WashlOgton, 
who tOok the womens' Whittier 
Cup. The Penn Athletlc Club had 
the fastest time of the day, 
finishing in 5:54, and won the 
Borthwick Cup. 

For nine hours of sand sun and 
suds (it was afteraU spon ered by 
Lowenbrau) spectators witnessed 
45 races wllh over 2.300 
participants ir'Olr 80 schools and

In Weissman's words, the day 
was 'a little Olsappoiming." The 
men's lighrweights showed a 
glimmer of hope, but just mIssed 
qualifying for the finals by less than 
half a second. They held third 
place for most of the race but were 
edged out by UClA in the final 250 
meters of the 2,000 meter race. 

WeIsman felt the loss was 
unfonunate for a number of 
reasons. "The time was fast enough 
to qualify had we been in the other

new and we didn't get a lot of 
practlce time in il" 

Lightweight rower Tom 
Williamson explained that the 
shell was designed for 
heavyweights but the team didn't 
have enough money to buy a 
lightweight shell as they had 
planned. "It slowed us down rwo or 
three seconds," he said. 

Behrens didn't allow her Mills opponent a single game in her match,

there next year." The lightweights 

The women 's novice team was the only UCSD entry to make the finals. 

UCSD shuts down Mills 
By BRIAN ITOW, Staff Writer 

Despite being plagued by injury and illness, the 
UCSD women's tennis team trounced Mills College 8-
1 on Saturday. In beating Mills , UCSD did not lose so 
much as one set; their only loss was due to default 
when one of their players became ill just ptior to the 
match. 

The victory improved the Triton 's record against 
Division DI opponents to 6-1 and moved them closer 
to a berth in the National Tournament. They are 
trying to regain the title they won in 1985, but were 
unable to defend one year later. 

UCSD Coach Liz laPlante believes the team's 
chances are good. "[The Ttitonsl are potentially as 
strong as the 1985 team that won the national 
championship. This is the hardest team I've had at 
UCSD. We have the potential to do It again if we keep 
everyone healthy and our confidence level up ." 

Against Mills, health was the only real problem. 

With their number three player, Rhonda Meier, out 
due to an ankle injury and number five player, 
Colleen Richey, ill, only five Tritons were ready at 
match-time and UCSD had to default Its number SIX 
singles match . 

On the court, however, the Tritons dominated . It 
took Christine Behrens less than 45 minutes to defeat 
Georgia Bernhard 6-0,6-0. Nancy Calhoun followed 
WIth a 6-2, 6-0 victory. Denise Sugi won handily 6-0, 
6-0. Then, Jill Berman and Jan Schimke won their 
matches by scores of 6-1 , 6-1 and 6-1 , 6-0, 
respectively. After the singles players clinched the 
victory, the doubles teams finished the match with 
three easy victories to complete the 8-1 trouncing of 
an undermatched Mills College team.

The league is dedicated to the 
development of native talent. Here 
in San Diego, the Nomads boast 
three Nallonal Youth players, one 
of whom grew up in LaJolla. Thus, 
the native Lucas Manin plays along 
with Marcello Balboa and Ray 
Fernandez. All will be a pan of 
America's ational Youth Team 
when it plays later in ChIle. 

The Nomads play on Warren 
Field at UCSD for two reasons,

The first half was much like the

Both the Nomads and the

ball game. The ball is often given to 
the speedy wingers to be crossed

clubs can gct seriously rough . 

True to form, the second half 
went much like the first three

La Plante, "is the best number one 
player we've had al UCSD. She hits 
harder than most DIviSIOn I players 
and has the potential to be the best 
player in DIVIsion III tennis." 

Still, if the team is to make a bid 
to recapture the championship, 
they must first qualify for the 
National Tournament. That means 
victories ove r Western Regional 
powers such as Pomona-Pitzer, 
Claremont-Mudd and OCCIdental 
arc almost essential. 

UCSD has played each of these 
colleges once and has defeated 
Pomona and Claremont while

Roger Craib, their latest skipper. at

for years to come. Then there is 
Chili Davis and Candy Maldonado 
for the extra hits and RBI's evel)' 
team needs. No, the Giant's aren't 
OUt of conte ntion by a long shot. 

WeB, the Dodgers have Pedro

excuses of last year are Justified. No 
more "If only they had Pedro." 
Heck, that wasn 't I'ven a valid 
excuse. The relid pitching stunk

the elbows arc working, the 
pitching can do nothing but 
improve over last year. Eric Show 
had the best year on the Padre starr 
last year (which really doesn't say 
much) and has the pOtential to 
repeal again, Andy Hawkins was 
Ihe only pitcher to Slick OUt the 
mess the Padres were in last year, 
but even he didn't do so hot. Hal 
prospeci Jimmy Jones could come 
around th is year too. But even with 
this pitching pOtential, the only 
hitter wonh mentioning is Tony 
Gwynn, who was typical Tony 
Gwynn lasl year ( .329, 14 
homeruns and 37 stolen bases). 
They didn't get Tim Raines and 
they traded away Kevin 
McReynolds. So they seem to be in 
deep trouble again this year. 

Speaking of trouble , the Atlanta 
Braves have it wriuen aU over their 
cl~bhousc . The Padres at least have 
a potentially decent pitching staff. 
The Braves would have zippo if it 
weren't for Dale Murphy. Pitching;

this year trying to put the pieces

beginning. Hope for their offense 
is bleak at best. Their infield is old 
and their bats are weak. Poor 
Murphy has to cany these guys but 
it is geuing awfully difficult. Last 
year was his worst since 1981. He'll 
get a little help from ex-Yankee 
Ken Griffey but chances are the 
Slats on this team will be bringing 
him down as weU. It'll be a long year 
for the Braves in 1987. ~

both for those with opinions to

While no single newspaper can 
posSibly appease aU students, 
most of those who write for an 
opinionated publication agree 
that alternative media is 
necessaty to maintain a balanced 
exchange of ideas. 

As Salvador Reza of Voz 
Fronteriztl emphasized, "By giving 
suppon to alu"mative media, 
UCSD is enhancing ideas to the

Dear Students-
I think it would only be fair to forward this infonnation to you regarding 
the foolball referendum question, 

Dear John, 

John Riley 
A,S, PresideOl 

Thank you for your phone call thiS momlng tnfonnmg me of the actions taken by the AsSOCiated 
Students' Council last evenmg regardmg the referendum question on fOOlball. As I have shared with 
you prcvlously, I wholeheanedly suppon the question of whether UCSD should enter the fOOlball 
arena being deCided by UCSO students My only concern IS that the football program be funded in a 
realiStiC manner. Based on the extensive r.search that my staff and I have done and our beSt 
professlonal1udgment. we don't beheve that the 56.SO/quaner proposed assessment would cover 
annual operating expenses for football . nor additionally allow for funds to be directed to other sportS 
teams' needs 

It IS my understanding that the budget which was developed by the athletics staff has been 
reVIsed by the proposers of the referendum quesllon based on information they have from a 
community college fOOlball program. The staff. [acllity. and equipment resources of that community 
college apparently allow [or less dollars to be needed In those arcas. as that IS where the largest 
dlfTerences appear In the twO budgets. Given the Significant defiCiency In UCSO's current football 
related equipment. faCilities . and suppon staff. If the referendum were passed With a S6.5O/ quaner 
assessment. the athletic department can make no commlttment to the time frame that would be 
necessary to implement a realistic DiVISIon III fOOlball program. There are funher unasnswered 
questions 10 regands to faclhtles that could require slgmflcant additional fu nds m the near future. 
Consequently. II m.y take several years to accumulate suffiCient funds to cover anticipated 
expenses. 

I would ask that copies of Ihls letter be attached to each referendum ballot 10 hopes of clearly 
deserlblng the vcahillty of the '>6.50 assessment Thank you for your assistance in sharing thiS 
Imformauon with UCSO students. 

Sincere ly.
