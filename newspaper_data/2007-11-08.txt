The Loft, a highly anticipated 
element of Price Center’s ongoing 
expansion, is expected to open by 
Spring Quarter 2008. The nightclub 
is designed to give the campus com-
munity a place to socialize and relax 
in a venue that is unlike any other 
at UCSD, complete with a wine and 
tapas bar. 

The Loft is being constructed 
beside Price Center’s new main 
entrance, and will be located on 
the second floor. It will also have 
floor-to-ceiling glass windows so 
passersby can see inside and patrons 
can look out at the view of the Myers 
Loop — which will eventually be a 
park — and the grand staircase of 
the new Price Center.

“The words we’re using to 
describe the Loft are ‘performance 
crossroads and social lounge,’” 
University Events Office Director 
Martin Wollesen said. “We want 
to create a space where we have 
everything from rock-and-roll, a 
late-night DJ, jazz, spoken word to 
film festivals. It’s a way to check out 
something different every night.” 

Wollesen said that Loft patrons 

will first enter a vestibule and then 
arrive at bar and restaurant seating. 
Customers can relax at the bar but 
still turn to face the stage, a lounge 
area with a cabaret-style setup. 
University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino said the Loft’s entrance will 
face the new social space, located 
beside the Cross-Cultural Center. 

“When you walk out of the Loft, 
you can see great artwork on the 
wall,” he said. “It’s in the perfect 
location. It will be right above the 
atrium and there will be an open feel 
with lighting from all the windows.”

Both Terzino and Wollesen 
stressed the importance of the cos-
mopolitan and urban feel they hope 
the Loft will provide its patrons. They 
said they had always planned for the 

nightclub to be a social oncampus 
space that promoted interactivity.

“An idea we have is an iPod juke-
box,” Wollesen said. “Students can 
put in their own playlists or can enter 
their own music. We also are think-
ing of taking photos of students who 
walk in and projecting it on a screen 
for the day, or putting blank books on 
tables for people can come, contrib-
ute and leave a legacy, in a way.” 

Wollesen said he hopes to book 
programming four to six nights a 
week. Although funding has not 
yet been reserved for recruiting tal-
ent, ArtPower! has scheduled the 
Tentacle Sessions and FilmPower! 
has scheduled the Teeny Tiny

International House has long 
maintained a reputation as UCSD’s 
multi-cultural, ultra-social metrop-
olis. However, that reputation 
may be threatened this year by 
an unlikely source — the Eleanor 
Roosevelt College sophomore. 

While the addition of extra 
bunks to triple up freshman dorms 
was able to accommodate last year’s 
enormous freshman class, the col-
lege’s apartments have not been 
as successful, with sophomores 
insured by housing contracts spill-
ing over into I-House.

The ERC Residence Life Office 
estimates that this year, out of the 
146 American students living in 
Asante, Cuzco and Kathmandu 
Halls, an unprecedented 80 — 
more than 54 percent of the total 
American population in I-House 
— are sophomores.

Although still required to com-
plete I-House applications, sopho-
mores were judged separately from 
juniors and were not in competition 
with each other, I-House Director 
Christi Gilhoi said.

Apart from class level, this year’s 
I-House population has witnessed 
other demographic changes. While 

Gilhoi said the number of inter-
national and American students is 
kept close to 50 percent, the 103 
international students living in I-
House this year comprise only 41 
percent of its population. Last year, 
international students outnumbered 
Americans by 6 percent.

The decline in foreign students 

and increase in sophomores has 
also affected the average age of the 
I-House population. Generally, stu-
dents living in I-House tend to be 
older than other students living on 
campus. However, the average age 
of current residents is 20, and a

A state appeals court ruled that 
the University of California must 
pay $33.8 million in damages to 
professional school students whose 
student fees were unexpectedly 
increased in 2003.

The Nov. 2 ruling by San 
Francisco Superior Court Judge 
James L. Warren rejected the uni-
versity’s appeal of the 2006 Kashmiri 
v. Regents class-action decision, 
which found that several thousand 
students at UC Berkeley and UCLA 
were entitled to damages after the 
UC Board of Regents raised profes-
sional degree fees by 30 percent in 
2003 and a similar amount in 2004, 
despite offering promises that fees 
would not be increased for continu-
ing students.

Additionally, professional stu-
dents whose educational fees (which 
are separate from degree fees) were 
increased after receiving billing 
statements are eligible for compen-
sation.

Affected students may receive 
anywhere from a little over a hun-
dred dollars to several thousand 
dollars, depending on their spe-
cific campus and degree programs. 
Including interest, the total cost to 
the university is nearly $40 million.

The ruling applies only to UC 
students enrolled before December 

2002. Promotional materials for the 
university from 1994 to that date 
— including the UC Office of the 
President Web site, the university’s 
annual budget reports and the cata-
log for UC Berkeley’s Boalt Hall 
School of Law — contain statements 
that professional degree fees will 
remain the same for the duration 
of a student’s enrollment, and that 
fee increases will affect only new 
students.

The plaintiffs, eight UC alumni 
who filed suit on behalf of all affect-
ed students, argued that the 2003 
fee hikes were a violation of those 
guarantees.

The university countered that 
all fee advertisements — includ-
ing those presented by the plaintiffs 
— contain a general disclaimer that 
fees may be increased at any time. 
However, the 2003 fee increases 
came after billing statements had 
already been mailed. In its decision, 
the court wrote that the disclaimer 
could not apply to fees that had 
already been assessed. 

“If we were to permit the uni-
versity’s disclaimer to permit it to 
raise the fees at any time without 
providing the students with any 
notice, even after students have paid 
their bills, this would lead to absurd 
results,” the court opinion said.

The decision comes after a long

‘Loft’ to Bring Nightlife to Price Center

By Neda Oreizy
Senior Staff Writer

The University of California Board 
of Admissions and Relations with 
Schools recently developed a policy 
that seeks to change decades-old eli-
gibility requirements in order to bet-
ter reflect the state’s population. 

The policy is currently under 
review by Academic Senate commit-
tees at each UC campus. Any identi-
fied problems will be aggregated at the 
systemwide B.O.A.R.S. Committee in 
Oakland on Dec. 7, before going to 
the Academic Assembly and landing 
on the UC president’s desk for the UC 
Board of Regents’ approval. 

The state’s 1960 Master Plan for 
Education specifies that the UC sys-
tem draw from the top one-eighth 
of high school seniors for its fresh-

UC Dominates White 
House’s Science Awards

Six UC researchers were honored 
with the Presidential Early Career 
Awards for Scientists and Engineers 
at a White House ceremony on Nov. 
1, making University of California the 
recipient of more awards than any 
other institution. 

John Marburger III, President 
George W. Bush’s science adviser 
and director of the White House 
Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, presented the honors to 
58 scientists and engineers. The 
awards recognize exceptional lead-
ership potential at the outset of the 
recipient’s professional scientific 
career.

The award, established in 1996, 
includes research funding for a max-
imum of five years to support criti-
cal government missions. It is the 
highest honor the U.S. government 
bestows on scientists and engineers 
beginning their independent careers. 
Recipients are nominated annually 
by nine federal departments and 
agencies.

UCSD’s Brian Keating, assistant 
professor of physics, and Katerina 
Akassoglou, assistant professor of 
pharmacology, were among this 
year’s award recipients for their work 
in astrophysics and molecular and 
cellular mechanisms, respectively.  

“We take great pride in the 
University of California scholars 
who have been recognized by these 
awards,” UC President Robert C. 
Dynes said in a press release. “They 
are making valuable contributions 
to scientific discovery in an exciting 
range of fields, and we look forward 
with great anticipation to their con-

tinued accomplishments.”

Inflammation Leads to 
Diabetes, Not Obesity

A recent study conducted by 
researchers at the UCSD School 
of Medicine found that inflamma-
tion provoked by immune cells 
called macrophages causes insulin 
resistance and Type 2 diabetes. 
The discovery may break ground in 
novel drug development to fight the 
epidemic of Type 2 diabetes associ-
ated with obesity.  

It has been theorized in recent 
years that chronic, low-grade tis-
sue inflammation related to obesity, 
the world’s most prevalent meta-
bolic disease, contributes to insulin 
resistance, the major cause of Type 
2 diabetes. The research, which 
utilizes mouse models, proved that 
disabling the macrophage inflam-
matory pathway prevents insulin 
resistance and the resultant Type 2 
diabetes.

The findings of the research 
team, led by Michael Karin, profes-
sor of pharmacology, and Jerrold 
Olefsky, distinguished professor of 
medicine and associate dean for 
scientific affairs, will be published 
as the feature article in the Nov. 7 
issue of Cell Metabolism.  

“Our research shows that insu-
lin resistance can be disassociated 
from the increase in body fat asso-
ciated with obesity,” Olefsky said 
in a press release. “We aren’t sug-
gesting that obesity is healthy, but 
indications are promising that, by 
blocking the macrophage pathway, 
scientists may find a way to prevent 
the Type 2 diabetes not linked to 
obesity and fatty livers.”

period of tight state budgets and 
ever-increasing student fees, partic-
ularly for graduate and professional 
students. At Boalt, for example, the 
professional degree fee — only one 
component of student fees — more 
than doubled between the 2002 and 
2005 academic years, increasing 
from $6,000 in 2002 to over $15,000 
in 2005.

Professional fees at all UC 
schools saw a temporary two-year 
hike in 2005, when the regents nar-
rowly approved a fee increase to 
recoup losses after a preliminary 
injunction in the Kashmiri case pro-
hibited the university from charging 
increased professional degree fees.

“Essentially, the UC Board of 
Regents would be imposing a fee 
increase to compensate for the 
losses incurred by a lawsuit over a 
previous fee increase,” Berkeley’s 
Daily Californian wrote in a 2005 
editorial. “The irony is simply stag-
gering.”

Though UC fee increases have 
tapered off in recent years, unex-
pectedly low state revenue may lead 
the state Legislature to slash edu-
cation spending in the very near 
future. On Nov. 5, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger already asked state 
agencies to reduce budgets by 10 
percent.

The university is considering 
another appeal of the Kashmiri rul-
ing.

“We are disappointed with the 
ruling,” UC spokesman Ricardo 
Vazquez told the San Jose Mercury 
News, adding that university attor-
neys “are really carefully looking at 
the opinion.”

man class and encompass “the broad 
diversity of backgrounds characteris-
tic of California.”

According to Hans Paar, the chair 
of the Committee on Admissions in 
the UCSD Academic Senate, 30 per-
cent of students admitted come from 
the top 10 percent of ranked schools 
in California, while few are from the 
bottom 10 percent.

“We’re not following the directive 
well,” Paar said. “This is not what the 
regents want.”

The proposed policy suggests 
changing eligibility standards by leav-
ing selection up to individual campus-
es. The most significant changes are an 
elimination of the SAT II Subject Test 
requirement and the eligibility index, 
which creates a combined GPA and 
SAT score minimum to apply. While 
eligibility in the local context — the 
top 4 percent of each high school class 
as determined by the University of 
California — will remain unaffected, 
no other applicants will be guaranteed 
admission based on the statewide eli-
gibility criteria.

“As far as applicants are concerned, 
virtually everything else remains 
unchanged,” B.O.A.R.S. Committee 
Chair Mark Rashid said in an e-mail. 
“The SAT Subject Exam scores have 
been seen to contribute negligibly to 
UC’s ability to predict who will do 
well at UC (as measured by freshman 
GPA).”

The new standards for eligibility, 
known as “entitled to review,” require 
that seniors take 11 of the 15 “a-g” 
courses, maintain at least a 2.8 GPA 
and submit SAT or ACT plus writing 
scores. This would permit 1.5 percent 
of California high school students who 
were previously ineligible to apply, Paar 
said. While more students would have 
the opportunity to apply, the number 
admitted would remain the same. 

“Our impression of how [the UC 
campuses] admit students is more 
people would be eligible, but I don’t 

think more people will be admit-
ted,” said Lori Walls, an Esperanza 
High School counselor. “There’s still 
a numbers problem.”

Paar said that three of the four 
committees at UCSD designated to 
examine the policy have reviewed the 
changes and identified some nega-
tive aspects of the policy — particu-
larly regarding the loss of guaranteed 
admissions for all eligible students. 
The practice has provided a referral 
pool for applicants who were rejected 
by every UC campus to which they 
applied, which allows other schools, 

typically UC Riverside and UC 
Merced, to offer the qualified candi-
dates a space in their own freshman 
class. However, Paar said, few students 
— only 6 percent — accept the offer, 
since they didn’t apply to the school to 
which they were offered admission.

“We cannot force students to wish 
to come to UC, just by altering admis-
sions policies,” Rashid said. “What we 
can do and must do is formulate 
those policies so that they are as fair 
as possible. UC has a responsibility to 
do the best job it can at identifying 
who, among the state’s high school 
graduates, are truly the most deserv-
ing of UC admission.”

As for the impact on UCSD, there 
would be an estimated 1.5 percent 
increase in the number of applications.

“The change in volume is very 
much unknown,” Vice Chancellor of 

Admissions Mae W. Brown said. “We 
would look at each file comprehen-
sively.”

Technically, admissions offices 
at each UC campus could decide to 
keep their higher standards, Paar 
said. However, it allows students who 
would have been otherwise very close 
to being eligible to apply. This particu-
larly affects schools that do not offer 
enough “a-g” courses or counseling 
to inform students of UC eligibility 
requirements.

“Students with lower [socioeco-
nomic status] are more likely to be 
ineligible despite having high aca-
demic achievement; the hope is that 
the proposed policy would encourage 
such students to apply,” Rashid said. 
“They would then be assessed along 
with everyone else via campus-based 
comp[rehensive] review.”

Paar said he agrees with Rashid, 
although he said that there’s no exact 
way of knowing how much of an 
impact the proposed policy would 
have. However, the possible changes 
still resonate with high school stu-
dents who would be affected if the 
regents adopt the policy.

“It would be more competitive,” 
said Veeral Patel, a senior at Valencia 
High School who is currently apply-
ing to UC campuses. “It might be 
harder to get into elite schools like 
[UC] Berkeley, UCLA and UCSD.”

The policy would have a “grandfa-
thering clause,” Paar said, which would 
provide two to three years to be fully 
adopted. And its overall impact could 
be very important.

“The group that benefits the 
most are students that are ethnic 
specific and students who are low-
income specific,” California Student 
Opportunity and Access Program 
Director Linda Doughty said. “This 
would increase the diversity at UCSD. 
That’s what it’s all about.”

California Student Opportunity 
and Access Program

Last night’s council meeting opened with a special presenta-tion from the Board of Directors 
of S.P.A.C.E.S., the Student Promoted 
Access Center for Education and 
Services.

The presentation began with a refer-
ence to the 1996 passage of Proposition 
209 that banned the use of affirma-
tive action by public institutions in 
California. According to the direc-
tors’ presentation, 
S.P.A.C.E.S. aims 
to maintain diver-
sity in California’s 
public higher edu-
cation system and 
assist continuing 
UCSD students in 
making it to gradu-
ation and graduate school.

In the spirit of ensuring diversity 
on campus, S.P.A.C.E.S. plans to pro-
mote UCSD to middle school and high 
school students at admissions informa-
tion sessions. The directors also hope to 
advertise the junior-transfer program 
on community college campuses to 
encourage more underrepresented stu-
dents to enroll at UCSD by hosting an 
overnight program for minority admit-
ted students this spring.

The organization was created 
this year because of funding secured 
through the Promoting Understanding 
and Learning through Service and 
Education referendum. It was approved 
by 56 percent of voters last year and 
added $7 to the quarterly campus activ-
ity fee.

According to the presentation, 
S.P.A.C.E.S. will be spending a sizable 
portion of its funds this year to buy 
supplies to furnish its office-to-be in 
the new Price Center. Next year, more 
funding will be freed up, allowing the 
group to hire mentors and advisers.

Regular business resumed after the 
special presentation, but didn’t give rise 
to any substantive debates.

Earl Warren College Senator Peter 
Benesch explained the importance of 
addressing parking concerns. 

“Demand will be out of control by 
2010,” he said. According to Benesch, 
three different locations for new park-
ing structures are under consideration. 

He described the possible locations 
by verbalizing an invisible mid-air 
map of UCSD and waving his fingers 
through the John Muir, Revelle, and 

Sixth College cam-
puses to indicate 
the relative posi-
tions of the pro-
posed structures. 
Benesch reported 
that the sites for the 
Muir and Revelle 
garages were about 

one inch away on his air map, but was 
unable to provide a scale for the map to 
the council.

During question time, Benesch 
asked Vice President of Student Life 
Donna Bean about the rescheduling of 
the Nov. 30 Bear Garden. According to 
Bean, the first Bear Garden earlier this 
year was rescheduled at the last minute 
to start at 3 p.m., instead of 1 p.m., 
because Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue expressed concern 
that the greater number of students on 
campus at the earlier time would lead 
to more students skipping class for the 
free beer.

November’s Bear Garden was brief-
ly cancelled due to conflicts over sched-
uling before negotiations with Rue led 
it to be revived for Nov. 30 with a 2 p.m. 
start time.

If the talk of parking garages and 
event scheduling threatened to become 
too dull, Thurgood Marshall College 
Senator Kyle Samia came to the rescue 
with his proposal to form a task force 
to explore the possibility of holding a 
“fabulous parade” at UCSD next year. 
He did not elaborate on his plans to 
meld marching and fabulosity.

Film Series in the Loft. However, 
Wollesen said the acts may have to 
find an alternate host if the Loft is 
not finished in time.

Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee Chair Garo Bournoutian 
said the Loft is still in the process of 
gathering funding. Last year, regis-
tration fees provided about $86,000 
in one-time funds to cover costs for 
lighting equipment in the new space. 
This year’s funding process has just 
begun, however, and allocations will 
not be finalized until late spring. 

The projected annual budget for 
the Loft’s programming is $168,000 
to $200,000, and funding support 
for both permanent staffing and 
student staffing is about $150,000. 

“[The budget] may seem like a 
lot, but when you compare four to 
six nights a week of concerts and 
events for a year to what is spent 
on one day of Sun God, it is really a 
great investment,” Wollesen said. 

Once completed, the Loft will 
have three central aspects — food, 
performances and the physical design 
— and will have space for approxi-
mately 150 to 250 people to exhibit an 
intimate, social feel, Wollesen said. 

The nightclub’s restaurant fol-
lows the basic concept of a wine 
and tapas bar, with a menu that will 
change every few nights and feature 
food that will promote interactivity, 
such as wine, cheese or chocolate 
tastings. Additionally, the restaurant 

will have larger food portions to 
promote sharing with other people.

“Everything will be social and 
interactive so people can experience 
food, beverages, performances, and 
be in a social setting,” Wollesen said.

Wollesen said he wants to imple-
ment a “pay as you can” system, 
instead encouraging donations for 
performances. There may be a sug-

gested contribution amount to sup-
port the artists, depending on how 
much funding the Loft will receive.  

“If you can contribute some-
thing, great, if not, that’s okay,” he 
said. “Most people will recognize 
that if it is something good, people 
can contribute when they can. I’d 
rather give people the opportunity 
to attend, rather than not go because 
they think ‘oh, it’s too expensive, I 
don’t want to do it. We don’t want 
price to be either a perceived or real 
barrier for students who want to 
explore something new.”

The Loft’s physical design is cur-
rently being coordinated by Bells 
and Whistles, a local husband-and-
wife design team that has worked 
on a few San Diego clubs, including 
the Starlite Lounge on India Street. 
Wollesen said the pair will assist in 
making the space feel less institu-
tionalized than the rest of campus.

“The Loft won’t feel like other 
parts of the university, so it has its 
own unique character,” Wollesen 
said. “When it opens, it will be the 
only venue like it in the UTC area.”

majority of students are 19 years 
old.

“Last year all of us were 21 by 
the end of the year,” said Revelle 
College senior Joshua Ocegueda, 
who has lived in I-House for the 
last two years. “Having younger 
people definitely changes the atmo-
sphere.”

Gilhoi said the goal of I-House 
is to achieve a mixture of repre-
sented countries and ages to create 
a snapshot of the world. 

Despite the age disparity, she 
said that resident advisers have 
indicated that turnout for I-
House events has almost doubled 
in comparison to last year, with 
the increased participation mostly 
coming from American students.

“I would say the challenge is 
getting international students 
involved,” she said.

While many international stu-
dents said they attend cultural 
events, such as European Culture 
Night, some said the social scene 
has not lived up to their expecta-

tions.
Revelle College junior Josephine 

Pheron, an exchange student from 
France, said she was disappointed 
not by the residents of I-House, but 

by its stricter policies.
“Most parties are shut down by 

11 [p.m.],” she said. “In the begin-
ning of the year, international stu-
dents who lived off campus would 
come to I-House for the social life, 
but now they think, ‘What’s the 
point?’”

The constant presence of resi-

dential security officers this year is 
another change that may be related 
to the larger sophomore popula-
tion, Gilhoi said.

“Whenever there are more 
underage students, a little extra 
care is necessary,” she said.

While Gilhoi did not know why 
more RSOs have been patrolling I-
House this year, she said that some 
RSOs likely remember the “trouble-
makers” from freshman dorms last 
year, and feel obliged to “check up 
on them” this year.

However, not everyone said they 
were dismayed by the younger, 
more sober I-House. 

ERC sophomore Liam Boogar, 
an 18-year-old American student, 
said the changes are “a step up from 
anywhere else on campus.”

Gilhoi said this year’s changes 
are temporary.

“We don’t expect to have large 
numbers of sophomores next year,” 
she said.

STUDENT LIFE — The U.S. occu-
pation of Iraq has led to over 4,000 
American deaths and roughly 30,000 
injuries. Hundreds of thousands of 
Iraqis have died and millions are 
homeless. Spending on the war so far 
has been over $461 billion. On Oct. 27, 
over 100,000 people marched through-
out the nation to protest the war in 
Iraq, and despite a demonstration held 
in downtown San Diego, UCSD stu-
dents seemed oblivious.

The campus administration is 
threatening to carve up the campus into 
sections where the First Amendment 
can be practiced, yet there has been 
very little student mobilization against 
this horrific act of autocracy. Political 
activism and an overall sense of global 
awareness are in short supply on cam-
pus. Is there some innate characteristic 
in UCSD students that leads them into 
apathy?

UCSD is home to over 190 student 
organizations, but only 13 of them are 
officially categorized as “political,” and 
only a handful more deal with any 
type of activism or social conscious-
ness. Although some students might 
be happily surprised to simply find out 
that 13 of these organizations exist, the 
number embarrasses in comparison to 
other universities around the country. 
Macalester College, a small university 
with under 2,000 undergraduate stu-
dents nestled in cozy St. Paul, Minn. 
has created 16 student orgs of its own 
that enhance social awareness and 
promote radical change. Why don’t 
Tritons seem to care?

A quick trip over to the UCSD 
Bookstore shines some light on the 
issue. For sale are license plate frames 
that read: “UCSD — the Smart Ones.” 
This is not some student-made joke 
but an officially licensed school prod-
uct, one that represents  the adminis-
tration’s chosen image of the student 
body. As one of the top research insti-

tutions in the nation and one of the 
most prestigious public universities, it 
would be easy for UCSD to depend on 
its academic excellence as an excuse 
for its apolitical persona. But a look 
to its northern neighbor UC Berkeley 
undercuts any of UCSD’s lame justifi-
cations for political inaction. As little 
as UCSD students want to admit it, UC 
Berkeley is a more celebrated univer-
sity for both academics and activism.

In the 1960s, Berkeley rode the 
wave of radical thought emanating 
from San Francisco, and still has a 
prevalent activist movement today. 
Founded during the ’60s — a time of 
immense social and political upheaval 
— UCSD originally did have founda-
tions in political dissent. The campus 
should be proud of its political roots 
and look to its once-proud activist 
community as motivation to revive its 
current one. UC Berkeley holds claim 
to the Free Speech Movement and 
Mario Savio’s bold speech on top of a 
police car, but few are aware of UCSD’s 

own historical protests, including that 
of George Winne, a 23-year-old gradu-
ate student who set himself on fire in 
the middle of Revelle Plaza in protest 
of the Vietnam War. 

The potential for successful activ-
ism on the UCSD campus is evident, 
yet since its once-proud days of dis-
sent, the school has focused more on 
promoting its science departments. 
And that focus has led to less student 
participation in social studies, helping 
cultivate today’s political lull. 

In 2006, 17 percent of graduating 
students received a degree in biol-
ogy and 14 percent in engineering, 
compared to only 2 percent in history. 
Unlike UC Berkeley, UCSD has sur-
rendered its intellectual curiosity to 
the social responsibility of becoming 
a top-notch research university, while 
UC Berkeley has been able to develop 
its academic reputation simultaneously 
with an active student body. UCSD 
cares more about pumping out famous 
doctors and award-winning research-

ers than motivating its students to take 
an active role in society. One of the best 
programs at UCSD, Thurgood Marshall 
College’s Dimensions of Culture, had 
lost touch with its original intentions 
of igniting students into global debates 
and action, and needed two outspoken 
teaching assistants to make the school 
realize its fall from grace.

Meanwhile, Berkeley activists have 
again made national headlines, this 
time with the noble exploits of the tree 
sitters. A group of Berkeley students 
have taken up residence in an oak tree 
for almost a year now, proclaiming 
that they will not leave the tree until 
the university promises to shelve plans 
to uproot the tree and many others in 
order to renovate its football stadium. 
The university has not yet legally or 
forcibly removed the environmental 
squatters from the tree. The school’s 
more lenient policies toward campus 
activism exemplify a more enlightened 

When Marye Anne Fox kicked off her career as UCSD’s chancellor three 
years ago, she brought with her a 
series of ambitious plans for growth 
to ebb the campus’ burgeoning 
housing problems. Among the aspi-
rations was a desire to, one day, 
house half of all UCSD students. But 
as campuswide overcrowding woes 
continue to pester the administra-
tion, significant advances in hous-
ing have been few and far between 
— and many have been beyond 
Fox’s control.

These shortcomings were 
most recently apparent as Eleanor 
Roosevelt College struggled to 
house its oversized sophomore 
class. With space in apartments 
scarce, administrators were forced 
to shuffle many of the extra students 
into International House — UCSD’s 
exchange-student housing unit that 
boasts a dedication to world cul-
tures and diversity.

While I-House does typically 
board non-international students, 
these undergraduates undergo a 
fairly competitive application pro-
cess, during which their commit-
ment to participate in multi-cultural 
activities while living in I-House is 
evaluated. 

This year, however, nearly half 
of the spots usually reserved for 
American students were filled by 
sophomores who were forced from 
apartment assignments because of 
space constraints.

The changes’ effects are already 
being felt by some of the non-over-
flow students who have complained 
of a diminished atmosphere as a 

result of the added sophomores — 
and rightfully so. The extra students 
detract from the original mission 
of the project, which was to boost 
global awareness at UCSD. 

Though the issue may be small 
in proportion to the campus’ over-
all housing concerns, it under-
scores a stunning failure of for-
mer Chancellor Robert C. Dynes’ 
administration and spotlights the 

incessant housing headaches that 
plague current campus officials, 
often preventing them from making 
significant headway. 

Dynes’ administration, which 
oversaw ERC’s construction in 2003, 
should have anticipated the recent 
booms in student population before 
it began construction plans. Instead, 
only four years after its opening, 
the college is already struggling to 

deliver on UCSD’s two-year housing 
guarantee. 

Clearly, the road ahead for cam-
pus housing is not quite as promis-
ing as Fox might like to have us 
think. 

Rather, as has been the histo-
ry for UCSD undergraduates, we 
should expect a patchwork of small 
successes and great failures in the 
future.

The Writers Guild of America sucks. Not to mention it’s anti-American.
Usually I sit back and adoringly 

watch its witty sitcoms and gooey 
dramas as the writer’s union invents 
new love triangles for McDreamy, 
McSteamy and the rest of the 
McCast of “Grey’s Anatomy.” I tune 

in late nights to watch Jay Leno and 
John Stewart ridicule political lead-
ers and cracked-out celebs. 

But alas, those days ended Nov. 
5 when close to 12,000 WGA mem-
bers took to the nation’s streets to 
protest their lack of royalties for 
online media. 

Of course, writers — myself 
reluctantly included — would like 
you to think they’re hardcore, that 
they live life on the edge and that 
on the weekends they’re skydivers, 
mountain bikers and rock climb-
ers. But compared to truckers, mine 
workers and firefighters — all of 
whom are also unionized — they’re 
featherweights. 

It was no surprise then, that 
when writers launched their cru-
sade earlier this week, their perfor-
mance was underwhelming. They 
were calling it a strike, but it looked 
more like a mid-morning powwow 
for the fuzz: Striking writers sipped 
coffee, ate donuts and feigned supe-
riority; the only difference was that 
they weren’t fat. 

With BlackBerry devices and 
picket signs in hand, they paraded 
the streets as more of a spectacle 
than a strike. 

They blew a major chance at 
resolution on the evening of Nov. 
4, when negotiators for both sides 
were hashing out demands. Despite 
active bargaining on the West Coast 
among Hollywood writers and stu-
dio officials, East Coast union mem-
bers went ahead with their plans to 
strike when the clock struck mid-

Flops to the UC Board of Regents for its 
continued closed-door policy involving 
student input in the appointment of the 

next UC President. 

With the appointment of a new AVP of Student Services coming next 
week, the A.S. Council will hopefully 
pluck the worthiest candidate of what 
Associate Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Sarah Chang calls an 
“extremely competitive” applicant pool 
to oversee the position’s resurrection, 
following last year’s extended vacancy. 
Chang’s recommendation is Thurgood 
Marshall College sophomore Bianca 
Harlow, a Student Voice! affiliate who 
is “strongly involved” with Marshall’s 
student organizations.

Harlow or not, on the appointee’s 
resuscitation list are KSDT and SRTV, 
two student media bodies that col-
lapsed last year. Luckily, the new AVP 

won’t be building from scratch: KSDT 
has freshly returned to the airwaves, 
while SRTV is moving into an upgrad-
ed facility with new equipment. There 
is much potential here; these student-
run opertations extol the flavors of 
alternative culture that this college 
lacks so sorely. 

Also under the elected official’s 
watch is A.S. Safe Ride, the coun-
cil-sponsored service that transports 
stranded students. This service is due 
for operational expansion. However, 
improvements shouldn’t be the impru-
dent kind: The new plan to include 
Thursday in the handy service’s days of 
operation is a step to take years from 
now, when Safe Ride is more popular 
and heavily used. The new student 

services leader should first find better 
publicity avenues to jumpstart Safe 
Ride usage while still maintaining the 
service’s concept: encouraging safety 
and convenience. Safe Ride, at its best, 
could be this campus’ most-used stu-
dent service.

All this is more than a full plate 
for whoever the council elects. The 
incoming AVP will need to exude 
communication and a serving spirit. 
He or she should expect to develop a 
good rapport with the council’s ser-
vices, and be innovative enough to 
identify ways to extend the services’ 
reach.

If the council occupies the position 
with a stagnant figurehead, it will reap 
the same result as last year: nothing.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

night Nov. 5. 
Although Nick Counter, the 

studios’ chief negotiator, urged the 
union members to postpone the 
walkout and continue negotiations, 
writers carried out plans the follow-
ing day to put primetime television 
on hold. 

I couldn’t help but take offense. 
Do they not realize the gravity 
of their morning mutiny? Prime-
time entertainment for millions of 
Americans is at stake and the insti-
gators are sans a plot for their own 
daytime drama. These are writers 
for god’s sake; couldn’t they have 
just scripted their strike ahead of 
time?

Instead, they went along making 
a mockery of themselves and their 
fellow writers with scattered chants 
and a severe lack of organization. 
In doing so they’ve slighted not 
only us, the groupies who tune in 
week after week to watch their skills 
at work, but also the hundreds of 
make-up artists, set decorators, cos-
tume designers and camera crews 
who are now temporarily out of 
work.

Indeed, the WGA writers, many 
of whom earn a mere $30,000 a year, 
do deserve the increased salaries 
that would come from the greedy 
studios’ tycoons if they agreed to 
pay the picketers the requested 1.2 
percent licensing fee for online 
shows. 

Granted, there are the few lucky 

show creators and blockbuster 
screenwriters who rake in more 
than a million a year, but these 
folks are few and far between. So 
of course I support them collecting 
money from slimy network and stu-
dio moguls. But honestly, why the 
haphazard approach with so much 
at stake?

This is America, guys. Primetime 

television is like a family staple. You 
can’t just go around cutting people 
off cold turkey whenever you feel 
like it or there might be another 
angry mob on strike. 

So for the sake of all that’s good 
and true — continued fresh epi-
sodes of my favorite primetime pro-
grams — I’m begging you studio 
execs, give them what they want. If 
not for their welfare, then for mine 
and for that of the American people 
that are being frightfully neglected 
throughout this whole debacle. 

They can’t afford another strike 
of 1988, which lasted five months 
and subsequently boosted the noto-
riety of shows like “Cops.” 

A repeat of that lengthy strike 
would force networks to air replace-
ment reality shows, a danger that 
would undoubtedly be detrimental 
to the state of the nation. We can 
only watch episodes of “America’s 
Next Top Model” and “Pussy Cat 
Dolls Present” so many times before 
neighboring countries stop tak-
ing us seriously — assuming they 
haven’t already. 

And to be quite frank, I’m 
just not sure I can take any more 
drugged-out Paula Abdul, whose 
future celebrity now seems cement-
ed, given the networks’ need for 
filler shows. 

FOX corporation executives have 
already indicated that if strikes con-
tinue through the holidays, we can 
expect to see the typical masses 
of atrocious singers that accom-
pany the annoying TV sensation 
“American Idol” hit our screens in 
early January. 

Five months away from devious 
housewives, mock doctors, pretend 
heroes and plane crash survivors 
would mean Americans would 
have to start reading, or better yet 
knitting. So please, studio barons, 
if you’re listening, hand over the 
cash.

Is this desperate? Definitely. 
Lame? Perhaps. But, goddamnit, I 
want my television back.

U.S. Needs Complete 
Nuclear Disarmament

Dear Editor,
Thank you so much for printing 

the letter by Achraf Farraj, Leonor 
Tomero and Lt. Gen. Robert Gard. 
The authors rightly deny that the 
development of new nuclear weap-
ons makes the United States any 
safer. 

However, that letter conceded 
too much to the pro-nuke camp. 
Rather than insist on the complete, 
immediate and unconditional nucle-
ar disarmament of the U.S., it only 
insisted that the U.S. stop develop-
ing new nuclear weapons.

The letter seems to suggest that 
nuclear weapons could have justifi-
ably been developed and stored at 
one point in history. The authors 
wrote: “The Cold War is over and 
the threat of an all-out nuclear war 
with Russia has greatly diminished.” 
That nuclear weapons were need-
ed to counter the Russian threat 
is absurd. No action intended to 
destroy innocent life should ever be 
considered as a viable option. 

A nuclear strike is a blatant use 
of indiscriminate force, and the 
threat to use it is a threat to murder 
numerous civilians. Nuclear deter-
rence is based on the idea that we 
can and should prevent one injustice 
by threatening to commit another. 
When the U.S. government main-
tains nuclear weapons as a deter-
rent, it issues a threat that differs 
only in quantity from the threats 
made by common terrorists. 

Al Qaeda may kidnap a few 
innocent men and threaten to hack 
off their heads if the U.S. does not 
pull out of Iraq, or release female 
prisoners, by such-and-such date. 
The message is a clear one — “Do as 
we command, or we will kill these 
people.” 

The same message is delivered 
by the U.S. government; except that 

when this government holds open 
the option to flatten an area of sev-
eral square miles with a nuclear 
explosion, it says: “Do as we com-
mand, or we will instantly kill these 
thousands of people and mortally 
wound a 100,000 more, regardless 
of the fact that they are uninvolved 
civilians.” Both Al Qaeda and the 
U.S. government threaten to kill 
innocent people; but the threat that 
the U.S. government issues is much 
greater than Al Qaeda’s, and makes 
it a bigger terrorist than Al Qaeda.

The letter’s authors attempt to 
cajole nukemongers by assuring 
them that the U.S. nuclear deterrent 
is “guaranteed for at least another 50 
years.” This assurance may comfort 
a warhawk, but it hardly comforts 
me. That we can retain for the next 
50 years the ability to murder thou-
sands at the push of a button can 
bring no comfort to anyone who 
fervently believes in the individu-
al’s fundamental right to live. It is 
good that Farraj, Tomero and Gard 
demand an end to the develop-
ment of nuclear weapons. But their 
demand would have been much 
more principled if they had called 
for the immediate end of that threat 
whose very existence is immoral.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2007

administration that UCSD officials should try to 
imitate. The thought of UCSD allowing a group 
of students to live in eucalyptus trees in protest of 
rainforest destruction is laughable.

By suffocating students with academic pres-
sure, UCSD leaves its undergraduates with no 
choice but to attach a sink-or-swim approach to 
their college experience, giving them little time to 
focus on anything outside of their La Jolla bubble. 
Most UCSD students will argue that they have 
just as much academic pressure as UC Berkeley 
students, and it is that brand of anxiety that has 
forced the student body to use its undergraduate 
experience not as four years of intellectual discov-
ery and glossy-eyed idealism, but as a premature 
departure into the real world. It is not that UC 
Berkeley students can better handle stress or 
are better at juggling both academics and social 
causes, it is just that UCSD students seem to have 
chosen to focus solely on the academic opportuni-
ties at hand. 

It does not hurt that UC Berkeley’s version of 
the A.S. Council, the Associated Students of the 
University of California, actively promotes student 
activism by distributing numerous grants of up to 
$500 for student group events that promote global 
activism and community involvement. There is 
no reason why UCSD can’t help promote student 
action by making funds more readily available to 
student organizations. The UCSD A.S. Council 
budgets roughly $150,000 to all student organi-
zations regardless of political leanings — about 
$10,000 less than the total budget for the Sun God 
festival.

One of UCSD’s most active student organiza-
tions over the last decade, Students of Economic 
Justice, was forced to disband last year partially 
due to lack of funds. The club had previously 
lobbied for, and succeeded in getting, all campus 
dining halls to agree to sell only fair-trade coffee, 
a global problem that the student organizers were 
able to bring to the forefront of students’ politi-
cal awareness. With vital student organizations 
unable to stay afloat, the campus’ activist com-
munity will only continue to deteriorate. The task 
of making sure these student organizations are 
sufficiently funded, so they may spawn as much 
student action as possible, now rests on the shoul-

ders of UCSD administrators.
All of this is not to say that there are no activ-

ists on campus, or that there are no student orga-
nizations working tirelessly on very important 
causes. But power is in numbers, and for UCSD 
to be considered a mobilized campus the student 
body as a whole must make a more concentrated 
effort at change. 

UCSD students are very intelligent and capa-
ble, and are therefore likely aware of problems 
that exist in the world. They may even have some 
desires to eradicate these problems. Occasionally 
these students will donate a dollar or two on 
Library Walk to different charities, but these 
donations give students a false sense of instigating 
real change, and only leave them feeling better 
about themselves and their role in the world. 
Donating to philanthropic organizations is a posi-
tive method of change, but it is more an appease-
ment of personal guilt than an attempt to improve 
the world. If the occasional charitable donation is 
the only manifestation of a student’s desire to fix 
the world’s atrocities, how can UCSD ever hope to 
achieve its supposed goal of encouraging students 
“to stand out from the crowd, to make a differ-
ence, to create an impact on the world,” as the 
school’s We b site so eloquently boasts?

Students need to realize that no matter how 
important their sheltered world of Geisel Library 
and endless chemistry labs may seem, these places 
and events are only temporary entities, and sooner 
or later they will have to leave UCSD behind and 
enter a world that is, in fact, much more ominous 
than a bad report card. Students devote so much 
of their time to preparing for a successful future, 
but their political inaction only increases the like-
lihood that their futures will be tarnished with the 
negative effects of indifference.

There are on-campus organizations dedicated 
to profound social change, but their low turnouts 
and drastically poor funding are indicators of the 
campus’ lack of concern. This apathy must be 
overcome. Students must take the initiative and 
overturn UCSD’s apolitical image. Most impor-
tantly, students need to realize that there are 
greater problems in the world — and UCSD needs 
to facilitate a path to this vital realization.

W hen I look at you guys, all I see is sandwiches — delicious sand-wiches,” Jackson O’Connell-Barlow of Grand Buffet admitted to the Los Angeles crowd when the band opened for Of Montreal back in 
2005 — and come Saturday, Nov. 10, they’re back together at UCSD, along 
with glam Brooklynites MGMT. O’Connell-Barlow’s bizarre interludes and 
kitchen-sink surrealist humor — touching on poignant topics like golden 
retrievers, tan lines and Bethlehem — spill over the synth-heavy hip-hop pro-
duction of Jarrod Weeks, a.k.a. Lord Grunge, with whom he shares the stage.

New kids on the bill MGMT channel David Bowie’s falsetto and ’70s 
arena anthems through an electro-pop filter. Mystical rambler “Of Moons, 
Birds & Monsters” makes it easy to understand why founding members Ben 
Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden signed a deal with Columbia after 

only one EP. Now they’re a touring five-piece, able to recreate their swooping 
pads, multi-track vocals and other space-jam ingredients in a live setting.

And then comes the sexually ambiguous climax. Kevin Barnes and 
his troupe of elegantly dressed bandmates make up Of Montreal, a set of 
near-twee, borderline A.D.D. Georgians who recently decided to go intro-
spective and tragically glam, persuading a whole new wave of fans to jump 
on the gravy train. On old recordings, the band devised conceptual tracks 
with vaudevillian pace, detailing fictional characters like Mimi Merlot 
and Mr. Edminton. Highlights from this year’s renowned Hissing Fauna, 
Are You the Destroyer? like “She’s a Rejector” shine with a metallic preci-

N aming your rap group “The Cool Kids” is a bold move, without a doubt. First off, it doesn’t sound 
like the name of a rap group. It almost seems 
like an ironic gesture, immediately calling 
to mind pathetic, whiny, androgynously 
tight-pantsed hipster rock, or some shit 
like that. Thing is, these Cool Kids mean 
it — they are cool, and they are acutely 
aware of what it means to be cool. To 
them, it’s both a blessing and a burden.

“A Little Bit Cooler,” from their new 
Totally Flossed Out EP, is practically an 
essay about what it means to be cool. “I’m 
about to say ‘Screw it’/ And grow a jheri 
curl/ Wear a diaper like cupid or/ Something 
else stupid and/ See if people do it,” Mikey 
Rocks explains. “If they do then that proves 
it/ People are just losers/ And they’ll do 
anything if someone cool do it/ But they 
won’t do it first/ So I guess they not cool.”

One would usually expect to hear such 

cynical thoughts on being cool from a loser, 
but that certainly isn’t the case with Mikey 
Rocks and Chuck Ing;lish. In fact, they’re 
cool as fuck. Not only can they rap, they can 
dress (what more could you ask for?) and 
then rap about how they dress — which is, 
for the most part, like it’s anywhere between 
1988 and 1993.

Vintage Starter jackets and hats aren’t the 
only way the Cool Kids are bringing the ’80s 
back. They also handle their own production, 
and only rap over stripped-down, 808-heavy 
beats reminiscent of Rick Rubin on old 
Run-DMC or Beastie Boys albums. They 
help us remember a rap world with no Scott 
Storch, no Timbaland and sure as hell no 
motherfucking Pharrell — because believe 
it or not, back then, rappers either handled 
their own production or had an in-house 
DJ, without a bunch of superstar producers 
on call for an instant hit. As a result, some 
old-school mainstreamers actually managed 
to have a sound of their own.

This homemade constant is the Cool 
Kids’ saving grace, rescuing them from 
becoming just another pair of hipster-
hoppers, or worse — dare I say — gimmick 
rappers. They love what they do, and are 
all the cooler for it.

The Cool Kids perform live with M.I.A. on 
Nov. 11 at Canes Bar & Grill in Mission Beach.

beside an erected scaffold or dozens of 
masked muggers battling each other, 
are endless readings of  contemporary 
iconographies, including sex, violence 
and constructed masculinity.

A Futile October Surge in 
the Media’s War on Piracy
A pparently, the Man feels that if he’s going to arrest the users and suppliers, he should take down 
the doorkeeper to the pirated-media 
flophouse as well. That’s what transpired 
last month, when British police 
arrested the 26-year-old maintainer of 
TV-Links, the biggest Internet index 
of online film and television, for either 
copyright or trademark infringement 
(the UK feds 
haven’t yet made 
up their minds). 
The Web site’s 
owner never 
hosted a movie 
or TV show, 
but he did set 
up thousands 
of frequently 
updated links 
to unaffiliated hosting sites, including 
Google Video and other variations 
of YouTube, turning the online card 
catalogue into a haven for Web 
subversives — and, naturally, a pariah 
for anti-piracy executives.

We’re told that the issue at hand 
is that TV-Links provides portholes to  
copyrighted material — the ethics and 
legality of which has never been resolved 
(imagine how many of our Facebook 
links would warrant an arrest) — but 
this public tarring-and-feathering is just 
another concrete slab proving that media 
producers and distributors have yet to 
find a constructive way to functionally 
adapt to the net. Instead, they’ve opted 
to declare their own War on Terror — an 
equally absurd War on Stealing. Next 
time we decide to wage combat against 
an intangible idea, I nominate idiocy. 

Last month not only saw the 
disconnection of TV-Links (which 
didn’t really do anything other than 
force the junkies to translocate their 
hunt to the hosting sites), but also 
the removal of copyrighted clips from 
YouTube (the pending lawsuit with 
Viacom indicates Jon Stewart and 
Stephen Colbert may testify) — and, 
to the terror of all you music folk, the 
shut-down of Oink’s Pink Palace, the 

exclusive and premier torrent tracker. 
All in all, anti-Internet media fuzz have 
had quite the October mop-up.

And yet fresh clone sites spawn 
every day, thumbing their nose at the 
entertainment establishment, taunting 
“Destroy all you want, we’ll make 
more!” And instead of playing bad-cop, 
media corporations wield their judicial 
support, then try to placate download 

fanatics with a 
truce. This was 
the iTunes plan 
of selling songs at 
one buck a pop 
— a noble idea 
of the new music 
marketplace, and 
one that created 
a low-cost but 
effective monopoly 

for Apple, but with the flawed flat rate 
that posed problems for how a song’s 
popularity and length should factor 
into the price.

So instead of adjusting their system, 
Apple and the media companies told 
consumers to take it or leave it, and 
the iTunes dissenters could return to 
illegal P2Ps. The cycle continues: P2P/
Torrent/Host gets caught, goes legit, 
and the illegal hotspot moves a few IP 
addresses over.

We are starting to see solutions. 
Networks like NBC and Fox are 
allowing some episodes to be 
broadcast on their Web sites, and the 
first real headway in online movie 
watching has been made with Netflix’s 
Instant Watching program. But by and 
large,  America’s media empires still 
share its current administration’s idea 
of how to fight a guerilla war: with the 
classically flawed invasion strategy of 
sending in all manpower without tact 
or foresight. We’ve passed the advent 
of Napster and i2Hub, so why are we 
only now starting to see aggressive 
media engagement with the Internet? 
This issue should have been resolved 
by the moguls back in 2002, instead 
of holding out for a change of course 
until 2007.

Better Red 
    Than Dead

               being     cool

  

By Andres Reyes
Staff Writer

S tones Throw stronghold Guilty Simpson is anything but easy listening. He attacks verses with 
a blunt attitude and equally crass 
delivery, and his lyrics sometimes 
border on violent and misogynistic. 
Yet Simpson is currently sitting on 
one of the most anticipated albums 
in underground hip-hop, due out in 
early 2008 on Stones Throw Records. 
His aggressivly raw music speaks for 
itself — and when J Dilla, Wajeed, 
Madlib and D12’s Mr. Porter are 
producing that music, it speaks vol-
umes.

But Simpson is in no danger of 
being drowned out, neither in voice 
nor content — which makes sense, 
considering he comes from Detroit, 
whose disenfranchised inner-city 
neighborhoods (similar to most 
major urban clusters in the U.S.) are 
consciously reflected in Simpson’s 
rhymes. “It’s definitely music for the 
inner-city,” he explained over the 
phone earlier this year. “You could 
still say my music is hood, but at the 
same time you could say it’s definitely 
hip-hop, because it’s lyric-driven.”

We’re always quick to throw labels 
on rappers, but it’d be a mistake to 
think of Simpson as either gangster 
or backpack. “I wanna be able to get 

on someone that has some get-money 
music, and at the same time, be able 
to get with someone who’s not stress-
ing any of those things,” he said.

So far, so good. Simpson’s raps 
were featured heavily on J Dilla’s The 
Shining; his indie label, Stones Throw 
Records, is quickly on the rise; and he’s 
performing locally November 9th, as 
part of the Kava Lounge’s monthly Get 
Live! series, hosted by Mr. Brady and 
Dannu of the Visionaries. Scheduled 
to perform alongside Simpson is fel-
low Motor City native DJ House Shoes 
— so look out, hip-hop and vinyl 
enthusiasts, because Shoes’ crates run 
deep and he’s been known to pull out 
the rare gem on a whim. Now this 
should be good.

Guilty Simpson & DJ House Shoes 
will perform live Nov. 9 at the Kava 
Lounge. Doors open at 9 p.m. and 
tickets are $7.

During Afghanistan’s first parliamentary elections in 35 years, documentarians Eva Mulvad and Anja Al 
Erhayem covered 27-year-old Malalai Joya, the first woman to enter the country’s governing body, as she embarked 
on a treacherous campaign trail. Mulvad and Al Erhayem’s emotionally raw look at gender and politics after the fall 
of the Taliban won them the 2007 Sundance Film Festival award for best international documentary, premiering in 
San Diego at the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown La Jolla. Alongside the hour-long feature, Cinefemme, 
a nonprofit organization for women filmmakers, will screen a variety of short films. (CM)

She may noy have the East Coast grit of her folksy, gospel-channeling father Greg Brown or the 
striking Western twang of her country-gal contemporaries, but Pieta lingers long enough amid her 
stubborn storm to wait it out ’til the end, when we finally have to stop and stare. And it certainly takes 
a second of endurance — through slippery, introspective tracks that often seem to be going nowhere 
— before she throws us that bone of intrigue. But once we’ve been consumed, her husky middle-state 
mystery is downright heartbreaking, and for what seems to be no reason at all. (SW)

R eady-made text and images comprise the lat-est exhibition from Marcos 
Ramirez ERRE and Allison Weise, 
San Diego’s 2nd Art Prize nomi-
nees. Born in San Diego’s sister-
city, Tijuana, Ramirez consistently 
makes work that comments on 
the sociopolitical nature of the 
Mexicoan-American border. His 
two-headed Trojan Horse, made 
of wood and standing 33 feet 
tall, was situated at the border 
to make a contemporary allusion 
to the historic Greek infiltration 
— but ambiguously blurred the 
lines between the invader and the 
violated.

In his exhibit for L Street Fine 
Art, Ramirez quotes a passage 
from Nobel prize winner Salman 
Rushdie, minimizing the letters 
line by line until the last words 
are simply textual suggestions.

Similarly, Wiese is an inter-
disciplinary artist who works in 
mixed media, including sculp-
ture, installation, sound and 
architecture. Her work alters 
spaces and cops language to 
evoke unexpected meaning from 
the familiar. With “Root Hog or 
Die,” Wiese continues the textual 
study she started in “I Ain’t Rich 
But I’m Free” and “Industry Need 
Not Want.”

W endy Richmond’s surreptitious videos are tiny vignettes of our modern-day lives. Her silent, 15-second cell phone recordings examine the paradox of the private moments in 
public space — moments we experience wandering the city streets, 
reclining in public seats or withdrawing from the world during train 
rides to work. Like the surveillance cameras they mimic, they are 
grainy, pixelated videos whose minimal aesthetic enhances the voy-
euristic documentation of her work. Richmond denies being a pornog-
rapher (she was once accused by a passenger of being a Peeping Tom 
who posted her cell-phone recordings online), yet she is just that. Like 
a pornographer, Richmond records the everyday, then isolates it in a 
framework that transforms the routine into a seductive, impersonal 
narrative.

lyrics on the album, which was recorded in the

his chemical depression, relationship troubles

Blue Sky Black Death & Hell Razah
■ Razah’s Ladder
BABYGRANDE

W u-Tang certainly stems its fair share of dead branches. The legions of cling-ons that adopt the Clan’s dramatic self-worship and 
scriptural philosophy are inclined to believe that 
rehashing Wu lyrics over a soul-crutched beat is 
enough to be worthy of the brand; what they can’t 
help but lack, of course, is the leading-edge aura 
of legends.

Instead of stepping in minion-line behind the 
aging eight, West Coast bedroom-producers Blue 
Sky Black Death depart on a less literal tribute. 
Kingston and Young God pull what they like from 
RZA beat signatures (like looped orchestral spikes 
and deep, battering drums), then use this blueprint 
to develop a signature of their own, built on the 
full-bodied ambiance of debut double-disc A Heap 
of Broken Images and last year’s collaboration with 
the deranged and scattered Holocaust. BSBD heap 
the blank canvas of Razah’s Ladder in a lasagna-

load of layers — soaked keyboards, electric riffs, 
horn coils, smooth beat-machine bass — and stuff 
the cracks with enough folk-instrument samples, 
vocal mini-clips and media snippets to overflow 
a landfill.

Leaning his street-weary bones on the pair’s 
youthful energy is a somewhat lackluster — if self-
convinced — Hell Razah, so busy flipping through 
the analogous elements of his biblically inspired 
ladder-elevation that he often forgets to hold 
on tight. The album’s 14-track spiritual journey 
is book-ended by definitive reinforcement from 
Razah: “The science we dealing with is elevation 
— which can be compared in a parable to a ladder,” 
he spells out in opener “Elevation,” and finishes 
the album with a recital of excerpts about Jacob’s 
ladder and Heaven’s opening, complete with bib-
liography. 

But as much as he may linger on this tired 

Wu-affiliate schtick, Razah’s not a half-bad min-
ister — and better, when he manages to forget 
his sophomore solo’s far-reaching concept, there 
are some precious traces of the beast that once 
tore through Sunz of Man projects and Wu-Tang 
guest spots, back in the late ’90s. “Pray Together” 
comes hard, as Razah picks up the pace and BSBD 
uncharacteristically pace themselves, holding out 
through lounge piano, acapella harmony and bay-
ing mountain-song before they drop the blues-rich 
beat in full force. The production duo’s spiritual 
subtext caters to the client — as did the nightmar-
ish thunderclouds they threw Holocaust — and, 
at the same time, finds time to indulge a genre-
rounding fetish for combining every last noise our 
technology-enhanced universe has to offer.

Enter Shikari
■ Take to the Skies and Run
TINY EVILS

W hat happens when you throw a few tortured emo boys into a seizure-inducing rave arena, then give them something to really kick and 
scream about? British sensation Enter Shikari’s 
hybrid of throbbing techno synths and soaring indie 
harmonies — punctuated by DragonForce growls 
— is an imbroglio of industrial riffs and noisy disso-
nance that probably shouldn’t work, but is persistent 
enough to be persuasive. 

So persuasive, in fact, that they’ve cultivated 
an impressive following among hair-in-the-eyes, 
glowstick-waving MySpacers, despite adamantly 
rejecting numerous major record label proposi-
tions. One of only two unsigned bands to ever 

sell out the London Astoria, Shikari’s self-released 
Take to the Skies and Run is a refreshing diver-
sion from most atonal thrash, a torrential metal 
outcry laced with Lost Prophet-inspired melodies. 
“Mothership,” the band’s first single, buds from 
an otherworldly trance-scape and explodes into 
an angst-ridden anthem backed by deft, hardcore 
hammering. 

Sometimes, though, this hammering seems 
misplaced — as in “Sorry You’re Not a Winner,” 
which unconvincingly vacillates between elec-
tronica strobes and sporadic metal barking. The 
punky “No Sssweat” and electrifying “Return to 
Energizer” are more successful, the familiar ado-

lescent act taking unexpected turns with swelling 
echoes of the keyboard. And while their efforts do 
deserve some credit, the headbanging warbles can 
grow a little tired without visual aid from the live, 
microphone-humping freakouts that originally 
won them worship.

Enter Shikari’s twisted techno mashup falters in 
some places and exhausts in most, but their exuber-
ant crack at genre-hopping is worth a second gander 
— if only to find out what screaming sounds like in 
a British accent.

Blue Sky Black Death
■ Dirtnap Mixtape

A varied dessert platter to follow the heavier, more wholly conceived Razah’s Ladder, BSBD’s Dirtnap 
mixtape — available as an album 
bonus on a handful of hip-hop sites — 
opens 14 more slots on which the boys 
can mess around. The comp breezes 
through no-pressure instrumentals 
and homeless gems from cut-short 
collaborations with Clan offshoots 
like the 5-percent-crazed Jus Allah, a 
top-of-his-game Killah Priest and awe-
somely slurry Midaz (whose Muggs 
Vs. Midaz stealthily showed up GZA’s 
sleepy original in 2006). But most 
importantly, the supplement frees Hell 
Razah and his Ladder costars from the 
album’s overwrought theme; the Paz-
inspiring Ill Bill brings a notably slicker 
game to the almost Jedi-Mind drama 
of “Darkness Deepens,” and Crooked 
L punches harder when up against the 
wily Ras Kass. Razah nixed first track 
“Holy Grail” because it stuck out too 
awkwardly from under the blanket, 
when it easily could have been one of 
the official album’s relievingly random 
standouts.

Oregon University, and Becijos was 
proud of the way his team was able 
to succeed in the West Regional.

“It is pretty shocking how well 
both teams did at regionals,” Becijos 
said. “But this year we knew that we 
had a really solid team and we were 
able to put it all together.

According to Becijos, the Tritons 
had been eyeing the West Regional 
since they began their campaign in 
late August.

“We were really focused and 
determined all year,” he said. 
“Regionals was our biggest goal of 
the season, and we knew we could 
go out and get it. It really means 
a lot to me because as a senior I 

haven’t seen a team go to nationals 
in all my years and to finally be a 
part of a team, and to be leading a 
team that is going, is awesome. I’m 
so proud of all the guys who went 
out there all year, not only of the 
guys who are going to nationals but 
every man on the team.”

The Triton women will be mak-
ing what has become an annual 
trip to the NCAA National 
Championships, and this year 
were led by senior captain Dianne 
Dunn. 

Dunn, who earned All-West 
Region Honors, finished seventh 
overall with her time of 21:04 in 
the 6K women’s race.  Senior Emily 
McGregor and junior Ashleigh 

Montgomery continued UCSD’s 
success with respective times of 
21:26 and 21:49, earning 17th and 
27th place finishes. Senior Amanda 
Burkhardt ended the race in 22:02, 
while California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Freshman of the Year 
Jessie Bodenhamer ran her course 
in 22:15, good enough for 34th and 
40th place, respectively. 

UCSD has proven that it can 
handle the physical demands of 
winning at the national level, but 
according to Becijos, a team’s men-
tal stamina could be the determi-
nant of a national championship.

“Now it comes down to being 
prepared and ready to take it on 
mentally,” Becijos said.

The lack of playoff success didn’t 
damage the youthful Bryant too much, 
as he was able to grow as a sixth man 
in his second year and become the 
youngest All-Star starter in league his-
tory. O’Neal knew a good thing when he 
saw it (as “Kazaam” obviously proved) 
and thus the Lakers’ All-Star quartet 
of Shaq, Bryant, Eddie Jones and Nick 
Van Exel was narrowed to the Dynamic 
Duo: “Superman and Superboy.” 
Unfortunately, “Superboy” was too 
mature to adopt the kid label, and as the 
son of a basketball player, Kobe carried a 
sense of entitlement. 

During the Western Conference 
Semifinals against the Spurs in the 
strike-shortened ’99 season, Bryant’s 
youth again would prove disadvanta-
geous. Several missed free throws dur-
ing the closing seconds in game two 
and an ill-timed turnover at the end 
of game three essentially handed San 
Antonio the sweep. As Kobe again dealt 
with failure, Tim Duncan — who came 
to the NBA from Wake Forest one year 
after Bryant — was a Finals MVP and 
the new Next Big Thing.

The strain of the O’Neal-Bryant 
relationship showed early on, and has 
been well-documented. The theory 
in LakerLand was that if Magic and 
Kareem could co-exist for five titles, 
Bryant and Shaq could too. When Phil 
Jackson came and led the Lakers to three 
straight titles, the relationship and team 
looked like it would hold. 

Unfortunately, each year that didn’t 
end with a title, the cracks shone brighter, 
and it became apparent that Bryant had 
become a selfish supernova, wanting the 
atmosphere but feeling constrained by 
the Diesel. Shaq was the king of L.A., 
and even if Bryant was more explosive, 
he was still the prince.

Bryant should have realized that the 
torch he longed to carry would have 
naturally been passed, as the aging 

Shaq would inevitably decrease in his 
skills. Dwyane Wade played Robin to 
Shaq’s Batman, and ended up as the 
Finals MVP during their second season 
together. Had he played his cards right, 
maybe it would have been Kobe hoisting 
the trophies and being given the torch. 

The love-hate relationship with 
Bryant had always been one of those 
dirty little secrets among Lakers fans. Of 
course he was cheered, because every 
night, even post-Shaq, there was always 
a chance that something amazing would 
happen (and it would in a near-upset 
of the Suns in the 2006 playoffs and 81 
points against the Raptors). Still, Bryant 
widened this rift, seeming to push Shaq 
and Phil out by flirting with signing 
with the Los Angeles Clippers, and then 
changing his jersey number to distance 
himself from the Shaq-led Lakers and 
ring up a few more merchandising dol-
lars. 

I don’t know if Bryant will be trad-
ed this season, and unless McGrady, 
Arenas or a group of semi-equivalent 
talent is involved, he shouldn’t be, but I 
wasn’t surprised by his demands. And 
I wasn’t surprised to hear Buss go off 
on Bryant, someone he had protected 
for so many years. And I’m also not 
surprised to find out that GM Mitch 
Kupchak doesn’y want to be “the guy 
who traded away Shaq and Kobe.” I 
also won’t be surprised if Derek Fisher 
becomes Kupchak’s best acquisition due 
to his ability to put a bandage on the 
situation, or if Bryant becomes such a 
distraction that he’s traded mid-season 
for an unequal package.

But I was still surprised when the 
boos reigned down from the Staples 
Center crowd in the season’s opening 
game — surprised that so much tal-
ent, so much excitement and so much 
history would finally not be enough to 
balance out all the negatives. Yet, look-
ing at the entire Kobe Bryant saga so far, 
everyone should have seen it coming.

Colorado Christian University, 
Augustana College and Western 
Washington University to win the 
tournament. 

Even though they are enjoying 
success similar to that of last season, 
the Tritons are relying on more play-
ers for offensive production. 

In the game against Western 
Washington University, eight dif-
ferent Tritons scored for UCSD, but 
none of them reached double dig-
its in points. Last season, Juster, 
Hansen and Osier scored the vast 
majority of UCSD’s points in almost 
every contest.

“It’s really been five people work-
ing together instead of just one or 
two,” Mezzetta said. “That’s really 
been one of our strengths.”

In this season’s three regular sea-
son games, Elliott has maintained 
the same starting lineup: senior 
point guard Marla Mason, sopho-
more forward Erin Noonan, senior 
forward Meaghan Noud, senior cen-
ter Alexis Gaskin and Osier. 

The Tritons have a break from 
games for a couple of weeks before 
they head to Phoenix for the Grand 
Canyon Classic, where they will play 
Western New Mexico University 
on Nov. 23 and Fort Lewis College 
on Nov. 24. After that, the Tritons 
will start their schedule of confer-
ence games in the hopes of win-
ning the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association championships 
for the second straight year and 
return to the NCAA D-II National 
Tournament.

Even though the team is basically 
starting from scratch this year, Osier 
is confident that the Tritons will 
excel this season.

“In the beginning, fans and other 
people not affiliated with the team 
had doubts since we lost four start-
ers and our coach,” she said. “They 
assumed we wouldn’t be as good as 
last year. But our new coach has a 
totally different philosophy than our 
old coach and I think we’re going to 
be really successful this year follow-
ing that philosophy.”

HOT CORNER

By Janani Sridharan
Staff Writer

The No. 10 UCSD women’s bas-
ketball team, which broke school 
records last year, is expecting simi-
lar results this season with a com-
pletely different look. The Tritons 
made the Division II Final Four last 
season, but with four of last year’s 
starters graduating, UCSD’s team 
looks a lot different than the previ-
ous squad.

The team is without guard Leora 
Juster, last year’s conference MVP 
and the Tritons’ leading scorer, as 
well as starting forward and second-
leading scorer Hillary Hansen. The 
Tritons also graduated last year’s 
center Jillian Ricks and point guard 
Kacie Kostlan.

In addition to the departure of 
their starters, the Tritons also lost 
last season’s head coach Janell Jones, 
who announced her resignation 
from UCSD after accepting a head 
coaching job at Division I Mercer 
University following the end of last 
season.

Taking Jones’ place is Charity 
Elliott, who spent her last two 
years as head coach of the women’s 
basketball team at Portland State 
University — a D-I program. 

Replacing Jones is no easy task, 
considering she led the Tritons 
over two seasons to a 50-10 record, 
including last season’s program-best 
27-5 record. However, the players 
have already bought into Elliott’s 
system of coaching.

“I think we’ve adjusted really 
well to our coach this year,” junior 
forward Michelle Osier said. “Our 
coach this year is similar to last 
year’s in the sense that she expects 
a lot from us and we have to bring 
intensity to every practice. Learning 

the new coach’s philosophy has not 
been slow. Her philosophy really 
works; it’s so successful.”

A major part of UCSD’s new 
game plan emphasizes defense. The 
Tritons, who mostly played zone 
defense over the last couple of sea-
sons, have switched to a man-to-
man defense under Elliott, and are 
already seeing positive results. 

“This is the first year with our 
new coach that we’ve been able 
to play man-to-man defense, and 
it’s become one of our strengths,” 
senior forward Alexis Mezzetta said. 
“We’ve been getting a lot of steals, 
making them turn over the ball and 
taking charges.”

With Osier being the only 
remaining starter, and the only play-
er who averaged more than 15 min-
utes per game for UCSD last season, 
there are plenty of opportunities 
for playing time. The Tritons seem 
ready to prove themselves under 
their new coach.

“Those players realize that 
there’s a better chance this year 
to get time in games,” Osier said. 
“With a new coach, it’s like a new 
beginning … I think last year, a 
lot of those players were frustrated 
and started to lose their love for the 
game. Now, everyone’s refreshed 
and their spirit and love for the 
game is renewed.”

Even though they are only three 
games into the season, the Tritons 
look to be on the same track that 
they were on during last year’s suc-
cessful season. After a 60-54 exhibi-
tion win at Biola University on Oct. 
27, UCSD traveled to Anaheim for 
Disney’s West Coast Tip-Off Classic 
from Nov. 2 through Nov. 4. The 
Tritons also posted wins against 

We should have seen it com-ing. The boos from the Staples Center crowd in 
response to Kobe Bryant’s introduc-
tion at the first game of the season 
seemed strange. Yet, anyone who has 
been paying attention — not just to 
the trade rumors, but to Bryant’s entire 
Lakers career — shouldn’t have been 
surprised.

Kobe Bryant was an intriguing 
piece of the Lakers puzzle from the 
start. People took to Bryant initially 
because Jerry West did, and L.A. fans 
trusted the Logo’s judgment. Shaquille 
O’Neal was the Lakers’ big acquisition 
during Bryant’s rookie year, setting a 
precedent that would affect the course 
of both men’s careers. 

Bryant, though not a starter, was 
slowly developing a cult following after 
winning the NBA Slam Dunk contest. 
But when he got a chance to showcase 
his awesome talent, he crumbled in the 
clutch. Rather than one of those high-
arching threes with time ticking down 
that fans have now come to almost 
expect, Bryant fired two air balls in 
potentially game-winning playoff situ-
ations.

Cup O’
Joe

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

For the first time since 2003, 
both the UCSD men’s and women’s 
cross country teams will be going 
to the NCAA Division II National 
Championship, which will be held 
in Joplin, Mo. on Nov. 17. While the 
women will be making their sixth 
straight appearance at the nation-
als, the men will be running at the 
championships for the first time in 
four years.

To qualify for nationals, the 
Tritons had to compete against the 
top competitors on the West Coast 
on Nov. 3 and Nov. 4 at the NCAA 
D-II West Regional in Boise, Idaho. 
Both teams excelled, with the men 
taking the third spot and the women 
grabbing fourth, both good enough 
to earn a trip to Missouri.

For a team that was not expected 
to make it to nationals, the Triton 
men are in the great position of com-
peting with relatively little pressure.

“We don’t have anything to lose, 
so we’re going to give it our all and 
see how high we can go,” senior 
captain Ryan Becijos said. “We have 
such a strong pack this year that we 
hope to just get in the mix at nation-
als and hopefully we can get into the 
top ten.”

On the men’s side, UCSD sent 
five runners to the West Regional, 
and all five of them placed in the 
top 31 of a field of 125 participants. 
Sophomore Jesse Morrill, whose 
time of 31 minutes, 44.53 seconds 
was good enough for 24th place 
in the 10K race, paced the Tritons. 
With times of 31:58.53 and 32:01.13 
respectively, junior Kevin Klein and 
senior Greg Geldman grabbed the 
27th and 28th spots. Rounding out 

the Tritons’ top five finishers were 
junior Daniel Anderson with a time 
of 32:07.48 and sophomore Max 
Mullender with 32:08.12, in 30th 
and 31st place respectively.

The Triton men took their third-
place finish with a total of 135 team 
points, five points ahead of Western

Women’s Soccer Gets Another 
Shot in NCAA Tournament

Despite its early exit from California Collegiate Athletic Association playoffs, the 
UCSD women’s soccer team is still a contender for the NCAA Division II National 
Championship. Thanks to a 12-3-2 regular season record that earned them an at-
large bid into the West subregional, the Tritons will have a chance to showcase the 
skills they exhibited so frequently during the regular season on a national stage.

On Nov. 8, the Tritons will take the field in Seattle to face division rival Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in a win-or-go-home test. The winner will advance to take on the 
Far West regions’ No. 1 seed and host team, the Seattle Pacific University Falcons, 
who went undefeated with 20 wins during the regular season.

UCSD went 0-1-1 against the Toros this season, including a 1-0 home loss on Oct. 
10 (pictured above), and is 12-14-3 against them all-time. Although they have had 
problems with the Toros, the Tritons will not be in unfamiliar territory, as they have 
made the NCAA tournament in 21 of the last 22 years. Coverage of the team’s first-
round game will come in the next issue.
