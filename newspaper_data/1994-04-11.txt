SANTA BARBARA - An 
electrical blackout 
temporarily paralyzed UCSB, 
causing traffic problems and 
trapping one student inside a 
library elevator. The student, 
who was stuck between 
floors, was rescued by the 
fire department after about an 
hour. The cause of the power 
failure, which blackened 
most of the campus 
from 5 to 7 p.m., remains a 
mystery. 

Scientist, Develop 
Memory Dru. 
SANTA BARBARA - Two 
UC scientists are making 
steady progress toward 
developing a drug to help 
people suffering from mild 
memory loss. Gary Rogers, 
from UCSB's Neuroscience 
Research Institute, is collabo-
rating with UC Irvine 
Psychobiology Professor 
Gary Lynch and a New York 
University professor to 
develop the drug, which 
enhances function of cogni-
tive processes. The drug, 
which may be taken orally, 
can potentially reduce the 
effects of Alzheimer's disease 
in its early stages. 

Scientists Find HIV, 
Cancer Unked 
SAN FRANCISCO - Two 
UC San Francisco researchers 
have found that the AIDS 
virus is directly responsible 
for causing cancer. The 
study's authors, Drs. Michael 
McGrath and Bruce 
Shiramizu, have found the 
first pieces of evidence 
showing that a human virus 
mutates genes to cause 
cancer, and not through 
immunological suppression 
as previously thought. The 
results of the study offer a 
possiblity for better treat-
ments for both diseases, but 
also raise doubts about the 
safety of new gene therapies.

Cuts 
Executive 
Perks 
By Iv ... DelYenthal 
Staff Writer 

In an unexpected move during a Wednes-
day meeting of the University of California 
Board of Regents, UC President Jack Peltason 
eliminated full-paid leaves for chancellors 
and other senior administrators. 

Peltason said he decided to immediately 
discontinue all paid extended executive leaves 
primarily because it is in the best interest of 
the university. 

"The university is something much larger 
and much more important than any single 
issue," Peltason said. 

"It is the greatest hope we have of rescuing 
California from its formidable problems, and 
of giving our young people the best chance 
they will ever have to build a bright future for 
themselves," he added. 

For the last 10 years, high-ranking execu-
tives throughout the nine-campus UC system 
have benefited from what has been called the 
"Golden Handshake," a package in which the 
executives were entitled to a year of paid 
leave after retirement. The reasoning behind 
the plan was to enable those retiring to resume 
professional duties within the university or

UCAB Chair Escapes Impeachment 
AWCIA1'IONS: 
Goodman maintains his 
position despite claims 
of charter violations 
., Ale ....... TIIIeHn 

A.~ News Editor 
Aaron Ooodman, student chair 

of the Univenity Centen Advi-
-ory Board (UCAB), narrowly 
avoided ~nt vote by 
the ll-member . during its 
meetina lut Friday, . n 
weeks of criticism issued by sev-

eral student representatives. 
The impeachment process, led 

by the Associated Students, was 
defeated by two votes of the three-
quarten required for an officer's 
removal. 

The final vote count was 7-2 
with one abstention from the War-
ren College representative. The 
representative Qf the Alumni As-
sociation was absent at the time of 
the vote. 

Goodman said the chargea 
asaiast him were unwarranted and 

"it WIS an unfortunate waste 

of time for the board members and 
the public." 

"It was a personal attack with-
out any merit," he added. 

Prior to the impeachment vote, 
the UCAB had also decided to 
change the time for UCAB officer 
elections from Winter Quarter of 
1995 to fifth week of Spring Quar-
ter this year. This was the option 
originally pursued by the A.S. be-
fore it called for ' the chair's re-
moval. 

Following the meeting, A.S. 
representative to the UCAB Greg 

Hearn criticized both the staff and 
faculty representatives-the only 
two board members to cast votes 
against the chair's impeachment. 
Hearn said he was disturbed be· 
cause he believed the two repre-
sentatives voting against tbe re-
moval viewed the impeachment 
as a personal attack against 
Goodman. ' 

"It's absolutely ridiculous that 
the alleaations were reduced to a 
personal vendetta, especially when

A.S. Appoints Cross-Cultural 
Task Force Representative 
DECISION: Muir senior chosen to 
represent council on chancellor's 
advisory CQmmittee 
By Candice McFarland 
Sta" Write, 

The Associated Students voted unanimously to 
appoint Muir senior Kimberly Martin as the A.S. 
representative to the Cross-Cultural Center Task 
Force last Wednesday. 

The selection was based on Martin's past expe-
rience with underrepresented students on campus, 
which includes working as a peer counselor through 
Oasis AClldemic Transition Program, and as a tutor 
with Student Support Services. 

She is currently tutoring for the Honors Achieve-
ment Workshop. 

Martin says she has found that underrepresented 
students often leave UCSD because they do not 
feel comfortable within the university~ 

"The school really needs to be educated about 
cultural awareness," she said. 

Martin said she wants to be an intermediary 
between the A.S. and the Cross-Cultural Center 
Task Force, but maintains that upholding the 
decisions and views of the A.S. is her first 
priority. . 

"I think there has been a misconception by 
students.involved [that] , would automatically go 
with anything the task force wanted, because I've 

worked so much with recruitment and retention of 
students of color," Martin said. 

"I am the A.S. representative sitting on this task 
force and I' m going to try to do my best to represent 
the views of the A.S. and inform the A.S. about the 
task force's ideas," Martin added. 

Poncho Guevara, A.S. president-elect and pro-
ponent of the cross-cultural center proposal, said 
he was pleased with the selection, adding. "[Mar-
tin] has a significant amount of experience on these 
issues ... and would serve the A.S. well in this 
position." 

Administrators approved the creation of a 
13-member task force on Feb. 14 to examine 
the cross-cultural center proposal and give 
suggestions on its implementation to the 
chancellor's office. 

Other recently-appointed task force representa-
tives include: Rachel Ross and John Welsh for the 
UCSD Staff Association, Carmel Myen, Delia 
Talamantez and Cecil Lytle for the UCSD admin-
istration, and Jaime Concha and lean Wang for the 
Academic Senate. 

In February, students developed the proposal 
for a cross-cultural center, which will be aimed at 
enhancing cross-cultural communication between 
students. 

In addition, the center will emphasize cross-
cultural education and research to promote a 
more informed and culturally sensitive campus 
climate.

Charges of A.S. Election 
Violations Dropped 
By Elaine Camuso 
Associate News Editor 

In an informal hearing last 
Thursday, the AS. Elections Com-
mittee mediated two cases filed by 
Commissioner of Operations, Ser-
vices and Enterprises-elect Wally 
Lockwood against the Students 
First! and Revolutionary Action 
Challenging the Establishment 
(R.A.C.E.)slates which allege vio-
lations of election bylaws. 

In order to avoid a sealing of 
the election ballots, Lockwood 
dropped one charge and settled 
the other. 

The first charge held that the 
fliers posted by the Student Affir-
mative Action Coalition (SAAC) 
endorsing R.AC.E. and Students 
First! candidates, were unclaimed 
campaign material, violating elec-
tion bylaws. 

President-elect Poncho 
Guevara, a member of R.A.C.E., 
said hisslatewas not responsible 
for the distribution or produc-
tion of the fliers. 

"We didn't even know about 
it until [the fliers] were up," 
Guevara said, adding that 
SAAC vice chair Nadina 
Powell made the fliers using 
her own funds . 

Guevara also questioned the 

application of this bylaw to the 
case. "This was not campaign lit-
erature produced by us," Guevara 
said. 

Vice president external-elect 
Naomi Falk of Students First! 
agreed, adding that a campaign 
can easily be sabotaged if the by-
laws are interpreted to make slates 
or candidates responsible for any 
campaign literature produced that 
endorses them. 

The issue was resolved when the 
slate agreed 10 count the SAAC fliers 
against their campaign budget 

Lockwood had alleged thatmem-
bers of the Students First! slate used 
A-frames taken from the A.S. Ex-
ternal Office, which violates elec-
tion bylaws against using AS. ma-
terials for campaigns. 

A-frames are the two-sided 
signposts on which candidates 
and slates post campaign adver-
tisements. 

In addition, Lockwood had 
charged that a receipt which gives 
proof the A-frames were rented 
from an outside party was "un-
clear." 

At the hearing, Lockwood 
dropped the charge of using A.S. 
materials because the Extern,1 
Office A-frames could not be 
found. 

"1 know "11 probably lose [the 
Judicial Board hearing], but it just 
galls me that people can abuse 
the system and get away with 
it," Lockwood said before de-
ciding against refiling the 
charges. 

"I helped write those bylaws, 
and to me its almost criminal to 
use A.S. materials for election 
purposes," he added. 

Falk and vice president finan-
cial-elecUennie Craig, both mem-
bers of the Students First! slate, 
said they did not violate bylaws 
and have never seen the materials 
in question. 

"We don't care if we win or 
lose. We ran a clean campaign. 
We got out and talked to students 
about issues and that's what 
counts," Craig said. 

'" don't mind losing fair and 
square, but I do mind being dis-
qualified for something we didn ' t 
do," Falk added. 

Both Falk and Craig won the 
positions for which they were run-
ning. 

Falk also said the lack of mate-
rial evidence in this case could 
make the Judicial Board's deci-
sion difficult. 

"At this point, it's my word 
against [Lockwood's]," she said.

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, April 11, 1994 

PINION 
A I • t t • r , rom SOU t h A , rIc • . 

The battle for power in South Africa is running on two levels - on the electoral playing field, where dirty, American-style 
campaigning has become the hallmark of the fonner ruling party, and in the political undercurrent, where anti-democratic 

forces threaten to subvert the elections. The future of South Africa remains uncertain. 

W ith their first non-racial elections only two weeks away, SouthAf-
ricans are faced in equal mea 

sure with the possibilities of disaster and suc-
cess, and the mood of !be country seems simi-
larly split between great optimism for the April 
27 poll and trepidation of what will ensue after 
the votes are counted on April 29. The main 
threat to stability continues to be the ongoing 
violence in the ZwaZulu-Natal, lhe eastern re-
gion of the country, where millions of dissenting 
Zulus, marshalled by Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, are threatening to boycott the elec-
tions and disrupt the voting. 

last Friday ,a crucial indaba (meetingofchiefs) 
between F. W. de K1erk, Buthelezi, Neslon Mandela 
andZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini failed to make 
any breakthroughs in negotiations, and it now 
seems likely that the only way a "free and fair" 
election can even be hoped for in KwaZulu is 
through widespread intervention by the South 
African army and police. Though such interven-
tion may be unavoidable, it could also spark 
further violence in this region, the most troubled of 
South Africa's "self-governing territories." 

The general feeling among political analysts 
here is that Buthelezi has blown his bargaining 
position and now sits with few aces up his sleeves. 
In two weeks, the creation of a new South Africa 
will swallow up the machinery of his small puppet 

~tate and he will no longer have the resources to 
prop up his party, which has been based on 
clientelism and patronage. In the new South Af-
rica, Buthelezi may be relegated to the role of a bit 
player, but the fear remains that his appeal to Zulu 
ethnic nationalism can still motivate large groups 
to play the role of spoilers in the testing years 

., ahead. At the end of last month, we saw what a 
powder keg such mobilization could be when 
thousands of Zulus marching through 
Johannesburg (some of whom, it has to be said, 
were looking for trouble) were fired upon by 
unidentified snipers, leading to the horrific rioting 
scenes which were transmined around the world. 

The election campaign itself has increas-
ingly turned into an American-style mudsling, 
in which policies and platforms take a back seat 
to iMuendoes, personality clashes and smear 
tactics. The National Party (NP) led by President 
F.W. de K1erk, the ruling party of lhe last 46 
years, the designer and operator of apartheid and 
one of !be most systematically racist and au-
thoritarian organizations in !be post-war era, is 
attempting to sell itself as a "new National 
Party." It is trying to take credit for overthrow-
ing apartheid and illlligatina multi-party de-
mocracy. Quite remarbbly, the NP is succeed· 
ing in selling ill m ..... .

Executive Council's decision to extend the fran-
chise to prisoners. The ad is like George Bush's 
"Willie Horton" -but without thesubdety. The 
ANC has countered with wonderful posters 
aimed at the Muslim community which say in 
bold letters, "Your vote is secrel-butnot in the 
eyes of God: Vote ANC."

statesmanlike 
presence will make 

up for any shortr.Ils in !be 
cut and thrust of his specific 

answers. Such a showcase of the two 
presidential candidates may well be aucial 

to the final results, since the polls are showing 
that many South African voters are still unde. 
cided. Though there is little doubt about who 
will be the new president of South Africa 011 
May 6, 1994 (Nelson MandeJa will lead the 
ANC to a clear plurality over aJl28 other putiea 
on the ballot). there is a question about how large 
the ANC victory will be. 

While most analysts estimate that the party 
will puJI between 60 and 70 percent of die 
popular vote, followed by the Nationalists at 20 
percent, alack ol"free and fair" elections mipl 
IeWlely impIct die ANC's abare. Villi, tIIere 
win be bid: South Afric:ana who are anabIe 10 

vote because they do not have identity papers, 
something which many did not reaJize they 
needed until a few weeks ago. Second, in a 
country which bas an illitency rate of up to 50 
percent, voter education groups are estimating 
that 10 percent of!be ballot pIpCI'S cast by black 
SouthAfricanswill be improperly marked. With 
28 parties, die ballot is extremely long-in fact, 
too long to fit 011 the ballot-paper marking tables. 
Third, there are fears that white f"arnw>wocrs 
will not allow thousands of their blaclc workers 
to vole, and finally, the continuing level of 
violence, especially in KwaZulu-Natal, will 
frighten many people away from the polls. All of 
these factors, disturbing for those of us trying to 
ascertain the real preference of the South Afri-
can electorate, mean thaI the ANC's share of the 
total vote might be closer 10 SO percent and the 
NP's share closer to 30 percent. This could 
fundamentally alter the balance of power in the 
new parliament and "cabinet of national unity," 
where all parties will receive cabinet positions in 
proportion to their national vote. 

The Nationalist Party's electoral success 
outside of the white community comes from 
painting !be ANC u a group of outdated com-
munists who wish to return South Africa to !be 
days of the Communist International and the 
failed ideas of economic nationalization and 
collectivism. However misrepresenta~ve this 
may be, it is striking a chord with the large

speak Afrikaans as a first language and are 
distrustful of anANCdominated by black South 
Africans who seem 10 have little empathy for 
their community's distinct needs and concerns. 

The ANC has proved, in fact, 10 be remark-
ably inept in its Western Cape campaign. lis 
candidate, the Rev. Alan Bocsak, despite being a 
weU-known "colored" ANC activist, bas shown 
little understanding of the plighl of the "colored" 
workers, driving 10 meetings three bows late in 
his new Mercedes. Bocsak further alienated the 
religious communities by walking out on his wife 
and children to many a white television person-
a1ity. For these reasons and a number of others, 
the National Party is likely to win control of the 
powerful regional assembly in the Western Cape. 
This is ironic because the Cape is by far the most 
liberal area in South Africa as a whole. 

Despite the importance of this first nonracial 
election and the cathartic role it will fulfill, the 
nature of the South African people is beat illus-
trated by the fact thai 011 most radio and 'IV

COMMENTARY: The American public must continue to fight for stricter regulation of cigarettes 

CIGARETIES, FREON AND JOE CAMEL 
ByD ..... J.H .. t 
Stllff Writer 

I wu up way past my. bedtime, 
trying to get,the urge to slap another 
article together when something in-
teresting came on National Public 
1Udio: the list of common chemicaJs 
used in cigarettes. 

It seems our favorite cancer-stick 
corporations are plugging Freud's fa-
vorite phalli with nicocine, turpentine, 
acetone, shel1ack and freon. Freon 
contains CFC11, !be chemical com-
pound which puts chlorine atoms into 
free orbit in the ozone layer (where 
they dine on ozone). It also causes 
liver canc:er. 

It's high time that the FDA re-
quired tobacco companies to list the 
ingredients they put in cigarettes. 
While !bey' re at it, they could save tax 
and drug-war money by regulating 
heroin, crystal meth and crack c0-
caine. Nicotine is legal, yet it's more 
addictive than crack. I know far more 
people addicted to Camels, Newports 
and Marlboros than hooked on crack. 

Anti<igarette forces are finally 
learning how to play hardball, setting 
up their own PACs (political action 
committes) to do battle with the scien-
tists and cigarette executives who head 
the pro-tobaa::o lobby. But getting 
tough won 'tbe cuy. Regulation faces 
an uphill battle. 

RJ Reynolds targets all the right 
people. Willie Brown, the speaker for 
the State Assembly and one of the most 
powerful African Americans next to 
Clarence Thomas, is number-one on 

cigarette companys' contribution 
spread sheets. It's chilling that African 
Americans smoke on average more 
than any other group. Who ems if 
Brown's electors are dying of lung 
cancer while keeping RJ Reynolds ex-
ecutivesinyachts?He certainlydoesn't. 

Bul somehow anti-smokingactiv-
ists have pushed people like Willie 
Brown out of the way and legislative 
relief bas sprouted up. The Surgeon 
General's mandatory warnings on 
cigarettes. although they may nbthave 
stopped a single person from purchas-
ing a pack of smokes, were a posilive 
slep. Two years ago, Californians 
passed a proposition which upped to-
baooo taxes in the state. The new 
monies have been used 10 fund medi-
cal research into the effects of ciga-
rette smoking as well as 10 implement 
a successful anti-smoking campaign. 
The percentage of smokers is rising in 
only one age group, seemingly im-
mune to this state advertising cam-
paign: kids. Us. Especially females 
between !be ages of 14 and 22. 

Why do we smoke? My friends in 
high school used to smoke unfiltered 
cigarettes, even cigarettes that were 
fittingly called DEA1lI. They came 
in black packages wilh skulls and 
crossbones everywhere. We like lac-
erating ourselves. "Cuts, like drugs, 
somehow satisfy." 

I don'l know if telling kids that 
smoking will make !beir lovers feel 
like !bey're kissing an ashtray will 
work. However, I applaud efforts to 
CUJtaiI smoking. Banning smoking in

section. 
restaurants, on airplanes and in the 
workplace are all good moves. I don't 
smoke and I don't want to. Keep your 
shellack, freon and turpentine to your-
self, please. 

But we can't simply tum smokers 
into another fringe, angst-ridden sector 
of society. The smoker subculture al-
ready bears the "impervious to your 
stupid health shit" raincoat to protect 
itself from the "you know smo~ing 
kills you" throwaway line. This is as 
memorable as Nancy Reagan "just say-
ingno." 

Cigarette taxes should be used to 
get people off cigarettes, not just to 
create ad campaigns demonizing 
smokers. For now, cigarettes are a 
legal addiction and should be treated 
like any other. Treating an addicl or 

smokers into angry huddles, lighting 
up far away from Iheiroffice cubicles. 

Cigaretle companies are very savvy. 
In a Louisville case, Merril Williams, 
a formerparalegaJ fora law firm which 
handles top-secret paperwork involv-
ing cigarene content for Brown and 
Williamson Tobacco Co., blamed the 
tobacco company for health problems 
as a result of smoking its cigarenes. 
Williams smoked the company 's ciga-
reltes for 30 years - until he learned 
exactly what he was smoking. Then 
Williams developed heart disease. He 
is suing his former employer not only 
for his illness, but for the emotional 
distress he suffered from being forced 
to examine documents and keep their 
contents secret. 

Brown and Williamson has neatly 
nipped the case in the bud by convinc-
ing the judge that Williams violated 
"Iawyer·dient privilege" by photo-
copying top-secret documents. At first 
the cigarene company and the law firm 
Williams worked for said that the in-
formation wasn't a big deal. Of course, 
since then, they've clammed up. They 
know that both the tobacco industry 
and law firms around the country have 
orchestrated a lethal hoax against the 
American public. Tobacco companies 
and their legal representatives also. 
know the only way that the "c1ient~ 
anomey" privilege can be defeated is 
if they have committed fraud. 

Williams cares little about receiv-
ing damages. He mainly wanls people 

to become aware that !bey are being 
poisoned, addicted and robbed blind 
- and that the legal system is keeping 
the hoax alive. That knowledge causes 
me a lot of pain and suffering. Friends 
of mine with asthma who smoke don' t 
bother using their asthma sprays any-
more; they just light up a cigarette 
instead. I don't know about you, but 
scrambling my chromosomes with 
freon doesn't sound too appealing. 

Whentobaccocompaniesareforced 
to tell what's in their death wands, 
when nicotine is regulated by the FDA, 
then real research can be conducted. 
It's true, we may find out that cigarettes 
only mildly increase a person's risk of 
dying from cancer or heart disease. 
Heredity and red meat may be the 
major determining factor. Now, though, 
we can 'I know for sure. No one knows 
exactly what we inhale each day as we 
rush past the Grove'ssmokingsection. 
I'd like to know. I'd like to know that 
the excess cancers caused by cigarettes 
are resulting in regulation and taxes 
which directly benefit nicotine rehab 
and medical research. 

Currently, I'm holding my breath. 
My editor, Mr. Alexander, just blew 
smoke in my face. He probably ex-
haled inadvenently in my direction, 
but the poor fucker does need help. 
Hopefully, the FDA, congress, law-
yers and judges will take a stand on 
the side of our health. The issues are 
complicated. I'm not one for falling 
on the side of more lifestyle policing. 
But with the world we've got circa 
now, I don' t see any other choice.

DEFACEMENT OF CHE MURAL DEMANDS ACTION 
EcWor: 

As an African-Amerian IilUdent 
at UCSD, i want to express my out-
rage at the de~ment of tho QJ6 
Caf6mural. Hrst,lct medcsaibe some 
of the damage done to the mural. On 
the face of Angela Davis somebody 
spray-painted the words, "Janet Jack-
son. " On the forehead of Malcolm X 
was a swastika, and in the area of his 
mouth, a tonguewasadded.l.astly,an 
inverted cross was painted in the cen-
ter of Cesar OIavez's forehead. 

This defacement can only be taken 
as an attack upon the UCSD commu-
nity. While freedom of speech cannot 
be violated. this is a true-ta-form bate 
crime which cannot be ignored. 

As a member of the African-
American Student Union (AASU), 
the Ooss..cwtural Center Coalition, 
General Store Co-op and the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee, I am 
often questioned about the campus 
climate and student apathy. My abil-
ity to answer such questions is based 

• both on my knowledge of racism and 
of a group's ability to overcome bar-
riers.

Given the nature of the damage 
done to the (]J6 Cafe mural, I feel 
justified in pointing to this type of 
crime as the justification for what has 
been deemed as the internalized fear 
of the unreal. This is not sOmeth,ing 
that my mind has created to justify my 
inability to cope at this campus. I am 
not just complaining to complain. 

Now I can ask, will all of you see 
what has been done? Will you come to 
a realization? Will this make the cam-
pusclimatehotenoughforyoutosweat? 
To the A.S. Council: will you express 
the outrage that should be felt after this 
bate crime? To the student body: what 
are you here to Jearn? How easy is il to 
.overlook Or ignore the problems that 
. face with those whom you share this 
society? 

I write this letter because I cannot 
stoically stand by and say that I am 
used to this. This letter is written 
because I am not strong enough to 
withstand this onslaught without tears, 
with regret tba.! it is taking the world 
so long to learn a lesson. I refuse to let 
these offenses go overlooked.

An Open Letter to UCSD 
EdItor: 

One of the main purposes of an 
organization is to be inclusive for all 
of those for whom the organization is 
meant. Therefore, the time has come 
to make a change in the Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual Association's (LGBA) title 
so it is inclusive of all people in our 
community. The prospect of adding 
another letter to lhe name seems ri-
diculous because soon the title will 
end up looking like the a1pbabet. There 
is a need for a term which describes 
the diversity of sexualities that exist. 
Thai term is "queer." 

Before discussing the merits of 
"queer," it must first be understood 
how "LGBA" is exclusive. The lerm 
"gay" has come to mean white, male 
homosexuals and lesbian has come to 
mean white, female homosexuals. Bi-
sexual applies to people who are bi-
sexual, but the term itself suggests 

two separate sexualities and reinforces 
the sexual binary of homo and hetero. 
Therefore,anamelike"LGBA"seems 
to be for only a select few. People of 
COIOT are left feeling as if this may not 
be a place for them. 

"Queer" quite simply covers people 
of various sexual desires. It is the clos-
est thing to a non-label for those who 
feel confined by the terms gay and 
lesbian. It is also a signifier of the 
diversity of our communily. There is 
no denying that sexism and racism are 
very real problems within our commu-
nily. These problems stem from a lack 
ofrecognitionofdiversity and the needs 
of people not being met. 

The word "queer" may initially 
present a problem to some people, but 
so did "lesbian." Somet~g has to be 
done to rectify these problems of exclu-
sivity and exclusion. The next meeting 
of LGBA will be held on April 11 at7 
p.m. at the Women's Resource Center. 
Those with queslions, information, sup-
port, etc., please come and be part of the 
shaping of our community.

UCAD: Some say 
impeachment is a 
personal attack 
Continued from .... 1 
against him," Hearn said. 

Hearn also claimed that the two 
representatives were apathetic to-
ward the allegations made against 
Goodman by the A.S. 

"The s taff and faculty rep-
resentatives were the only ones 
to vote no, and made absolutely 
no effort to contact me or any 
other s tudent government re-
gard ing the allegations ," said 
Hearn . 

But Kathy Hay, representa-
tive of the Staff Association, said 
she felt the criticisms by the A.S. 
and other student representatives 
were personal attacks directed at 
Goodman. 

" It really offends me that the 
A.S . has not participated [in the 
UCAB) all year and the first thing 
they do is come and attempt to 
remove the chair," Hay said. 

Hay added, "I did feel that it 
was a personal attack. What really 
solidified that feeling is that [the 
student representatives) wouldn't 

MIt ..... unfartunate 
waste of time for the 
board members and 
the public. It was a 
personal attack 
without any merit." 

-MfOft Goodman 
UCABChair 

let it go and allow [Goodman) to 
serve two more weeks. That's what 
swung me." 

Hay said the claims made by 
the A.S. that Goodman had not 
informed new members of their 

The UCSD Guardian 

duties stemmed from, "a lack of 
personal responsibility of the 
people that spoke against 
[Goodman}." 

Hay said that she had !lP-
proached Goodman to inquire 
about the responsibilities of her 
position and was given the neces-
sary information. "I didn ' t make 
anybody responsible for me," said 
Hay. 

Jeff Woods, the Fifth College 
representative, said that though 
Goodman avoided impeachment, 
it was obvious that the chair did 
not have the support of the student 
representatives. 

"Seven out of eight student rep-
resentatives voted against him," 
said Woods. "He hasn't performed 
his duty as chair, he hasn't repre-
sented students, he got no student 
support." 

Despite the apparent lack of 
student leader support for 
Goodman, Warren student Chris-
topher Bou ffard spoke prior to the 
meeting in the defense of the chair. 

"Frankly, 1 find [these charges} 
hard to believe... 1 found it pre-
posterous that Mr. Goodman has 
been acting in his own self-inter-
est," Bouffard said.

amendmenta 1Ind referenda. 

Tesak said she has not decided whether she 
wants any action to be taken. 

"I would never ask for Poncho to be removed," 
said Tesak. "I would not want unnecessary funds 
spent." 

Guevara characterized tbe allegations of voting 
procedure impropriety as "petty," adding that such 
complications are his initiation into campus politics.

of R.A.C.E. for the vice president administrative 
position because no candidate secured a majority 
of the vote.

Guevara said he will give his full support to 
fellow R.A.C.E. member de la Pena. Meanwhile, 
Barnes said he will rally his constituency "and 
hope in the end it will come out okay." 

We're going to bring in a lot of different members of the 
community. 

"My relationship with the cabinet is going to be one of 
motivation and inclusion, of different sets of ideas that 
people want to see addressed on this campus," he added. 

Jennie Craig, running on the Students First! 
slate, was elected vice president finance while 
Naomi Falx, also representing Students First!, will 
assume the position of vice president of external 
affairs. 

Guevara said he will deliver on his campaign prom-
ise to increase the numbers of underrepresented stu-
dents at UCSD. 

His first order of business, he said, will be to make 
the proposed cross-cultural center a reality. 

"The leadership is going to come from the top 
this year," Guevara said of the upcoming A.S. 
administration. "It' s going to be a real focused 
vision in terms of what's going to happen and it's 
not just going to be focused on the A.S. Council. 

Tesak was critical of this aspect of Guevara's plat-
form, saying the proposal for the cross-cultural center 
needs to be changed to be more inclusionary. 

"I don't think [Guevara) is very interested in any-
thing but the cross-cultural center,» said Tesak. 

PELTASON: 
Continued from pee. 1 
elsewhere. 

Peltason's measure, which will 
affect some 200 executives through-
out the UC system, constitutes an 
effort to quell the complaints of 
lawmakers who view the salaries 
and benefit packages received by 
UC executives as inappropriate. 

The matter is especially sensi-
tive because it occurs during a 
time of dramatic 'fee increases. 
Next fall, UC students will be pay-
ing 166 percent more for tuition 
than they did in 1989. 

Pehason said that the elimina-
tion of paid leaves might hurt the 
UC's competitiveness with other 
universities that offer such leaves, 
but stressed that " the University 
of California is in a fight for its life. 

The potential losers are our children 
and their children. They stand to 
lose an affordable college education 
in this state.» 

The elimination of paid leaves 
is the latest in a series of reforms 
throughout the UC system imple-
mented over the past three years. 

These changes have included 
the removal of 17.6 percent of 
executive jobs, the reduction of 
executive benefits and the hiring 
of new senior executives at sala-
ries lower than their predeces-
sors. 

Peltason noted that in four years 
the UC system will experience 
$433 million in budget cuts. He 
said the reforms throughout the 
system are designed in large part 
to "instill a new publ ic confidence 
in our stewardship." 

In addition, Peltason announced

that he has asked UC Senior Vice 
President Wayne Kennedy to in-
vestigate ways to " streamline all 
of our personnel policies and prac-
tices from top to bottom." Also 
considered at the meeting was the 
appointment of and compensation 
for a chancellor at Davis. 

Although no action is required 
by the regents to discontinue paid 
leaves, Peltason said he will pre-
pare an item for the regents ' re-
view so that they may " instill what-
ever board policy they deem ap-
propriate." 

As an extension of his new mea-
sure, Peltason also announced that 
he will relinqu ish his claim to any 
deferred compensation to which 
he may be entitl ed to. 

All of the deferred compensa-
tion, he added, would be contrib-
uted to student scholarships.

CREW:UCSD 
fourth in Cal Cup 
CoI.IIII.'~ hili ..... 20 
UCSD finished fourth (6:12.95) 
behind San Diego State (6:04.10), 
UC Irvine (6:06.28) and USD 
(6:11.40). 

"We went out real hard." 
Thiemann said. "We nn out ofsteem 
at the end. but fourth is the best we 
have done here in recent history. We 
were pleased with the result, but we 
are definitely still hungry." 

The Tritons' fourth-place finilb 
advanced them into the aftemoon's 
petite final of the Cal· Visitor's Cup . 
Challenge. pitting the fourtb-
through sixth·place finishers in both 
events. 

In a bold strategy move. 
Thiemann substituted the moming's 
racing shell with a smaller, differ· 

enlly·riaed IbeIl to provide a more 
evenly peced ride over the extendod 
diItance. 

"The pya felt that the last 1,000 
meters were not .. good as they 
could have been." Thiemann said. 
"So I thoupt we should go lighter." 
The change workedu UCSDexited 
the water first in its heat (6:31.25), 
followed by Western Washington 
(6:32.38) and UCSB (6:32.93). The 
placing gave the Tritons seventh 
place overall in the event. 

"We bad a much more paced 
race." Thiemann said. "Our lut 
1.000 meters were very nice." 

The women garnered fourth· 
place honors in their Cal Cup race, 
crossing the line in a timeof7:19.02. 
Long Beach State breezed through 
the event for the victory (7:08.56), 
USD wusecond (7: 12.39) and Santa 
Clara passed the Tritons for third 

IMPORTANT 

The UCSD Guardian 

(7:16.29). 
"Long Beach wu IlOl a surprise," 

Vallerga said. "We rowed as well as 
we could. I am not disappointed 
with the effort. " 

In the women's CaI·Visitor's 
Cup OIallenge. UCSD again quali-
fied for the petite finals. In one of 
the day's most exciting races. the 
Tritons put on an extraordinary late-
race surge to capture second. 

"A couple of crews had incred· 
ible starts," Vallerga said. "By the 
1.000 meters we were fifth out of 
five boats. Then they just started 
pouring it on. By the 1,500 mark, 
they were fourth and closing in. The 
last SOO meters wu a horse race." 

UCSD actually caught leader and 
eventual winner UC Davis (7:32.97) 
at around the 500 mark. The obvi· 
ously·surprised Aggies struggled to 
hold their ground as the two teams 

duked it out down to the wire. 
"Unfortunatley. (Davis] crossed 

a little ahead of us." Vallerga said. 
"But that sprint wu pretty awesome 
stuff. To go from last to fourth in 
that small a time was incredible. We 
kicked it into another gear and blew 
right by the field." 

The Tritons were credited with a 
time of 7:33.73. Notre Dame fol· 
lowed in 7:43.96. Mills grabbed 
fourth in 7:52.52 and the University 
of Puget Sound rounded out the field 
in fifth (8:04.61). 

"Normally it takes about two 
minutes to cover 500 meters." 
Vallerga said. "We were definitely 
under that. With a sprint that good, 
it gives me confidence that we can 
run down anyone." 

UCSD entered three women's 
novice boats which, according to 
Vallerga, performed fairly . 

SPORTS 11 

"We were Soing into the races 
hoping to qualify for the petite fi· 
nals but the competition was just a 
whole lot faster in the heat races," 
Vallerga noted. "They are all very 
inexperienced crews so I wasn't dis· 
appointed at all. (The novices all] 
showed a lot of promise ... 

In a controversial lightweight. 
four competition. the Triton women 
finished fifth out of five boats. 
Villanova won euily (7:53.40) • 
Radcliffe stole second (7:56.32). 
Fordham (8:07.51) outlasted fourth-
place Western Washington (8:36.74) 
and UCSD rolled in at fifth (9: 19.31). 

"The officials' boat's wake 
stopped us dead in the water." 
Vallerga said. "I wasn't too happy 
about that, but we were in fifth any· 
way at the moment it happened. Our 
time certainly did not reflect our 
efforts."

There's just no complexity at all.

Tritons Pound Panthers 
TRIPLE PLAY: UCSD (20-3) steals three-game sweep against visiting Chapman 
By Jeff Pf'8&Cht 
Staff Writer 

There are few adjectives left to 
describe the mind-boggling perfor-
mance of the Triton baseball team 

this season. 
The offense, 
batting a 
team average 
of .324, has 
been blister-
ing, while the 
pitching 
staff. boast-
ing an ERA 
of 2.51 , has 
been solid. 
The trends 
continued 

with a three·game sweep over 
Chapman University this weekend, 
giving UCSD its 14th win in 15 
games and propelling it to a 20-3 
record. 

On Friday, senior Ryan Flanagan 
set out in search of a his fifth victory 
of the season against the Panthers. 

Tied 1-1 in the third inning. the 
Tritons began to knock starter Alii 
Ray around. After a one-out single 
by Chris Miyake. AI DelFavero 
stroked a base hit, putting runners 
on the comers. 

In a play that was almost as funny 
as it was important, DelFavero. not 
known for his fleet feet, took off for 
second before Ray Iiad started to-
ward home plate. Luckily. Ray 
didn't notice the Triton catcher, and 
DelFavero collected his first stolen 
base. Craig Birk followed with a 
double, giving UCSD a 3-1 lead. 

After scoring a nan in the fourth. 
the Panthers regained the lead in the 
fifth. Kurt Townson opened the 
frame by tripling to left field. Fol-
lowing a walk, Duke Best brought 
Townson home on a fielder's choice 
to tie the game. Donny Disbro fol· 
lowed with a double, which scored 
BeSI and gave Chapman a 4-3 lead. 

Ray seemed to be settling down, 
retiring nine in a row at one point, 
but the Tritons got to him in the 
seventh. With Armando Sanchez (3-
5, RBI) running from first, Miyake 
poked a check swing single through 
the vacant hole at second base, al-
lowing Sanchez to advance 10 third. 

DelFavero (2-4, 2RBI) followed 
with a double which drove them 
botb home and gave UCSD a 5-4 
advantage. Ricky Ramirez later 
singled DelFavero home with the 
third run of the inning.

earn his fifth victory, while Ray

TOURNEY: UCSD 
softball tallies 3-2 record 
in UCSD Triton Classic 

, By Dan Kraft 
Associate 5pons Editor 

The UCSD softball team took a 
positive slep loward its goal of gel-
ling a shot at the NCAA Division III 
West Regionals al this weekend's 
UC San Diego Triton Qassic. 

While the Trilons' overall tour-
namenlrecord was an average mark 
at 3-2, UCSDbenefittedfrom some 
Iremendous individual perfor-
mances, which bode well for Ihe 
remainder of Ihe Trilons' season. 

On Friday afternoon UCSD faced 
ils firsl opponent, Ihe famed Fight-
ing Irish of NoIre Dame. 

Starling pitcher Shannon 
Mounger got the Tritons off on the 
right fOOl by pilching seven solid 
shulout innings. The tJCSD bals 
were also silent, Ihough, so Ihe game 
was forced inlo extra innings, knol-
ted at 0-0. 

The Fighling Irish louched 
Mounger for Ihe first lime in the lop-
half of Ihe eighlh inning, laking a 1-
o lead inlo the bottom half of .the 
inning. 

However, the Trilon bats sud-
denly came 10 life. Freshman 
Michelle Courtright' laid down a 
perfect suicide squeeze to bring 
home Ihe tying run. 

Then, wilh a runner on third, . 
Iunior Kerri Carter knocked a ball 
deep into Ihe Notre Dame oUlfield 
to secure UCSO's victory with a 
final score of 2-1. 

The momenlum of the victory 
served the Trilons well. and they

UCSD Volleyball Loses Five-Set Marathon 
By Dan Kraft 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
squad got a rare viclory opportunity 
when it faced off againsl hosl UC 
Irvine on Salurday nighl. 

UCI, like Ihe Tritons. had yet to 

earn a win againsl a Division loppo-
nenl Ihis season, and both teams 
were clearly hungry for such an ac-
complishmenl during Ihe 170-
minule, five-sel maralhon. 

The hot-tempered Anleaters 
proved 100 much for Ihe Tritons.

Irvine came back from a Iwo-game 
deficillo beal San Diego, 15-11, 15-
8, 10-15,11-15,6-15. 

UCSD eame oul running on all 
cylinders in games one and two, 
scorching the court with a .406 hit-
ling percenlage to lalte a 2-0 lead. 

"It was greal to see that we have 
Ihe abilily to play al thaI' higher 
level, " Head Coach Doug Dannevik 
said of lhe Tritons' play in the firsl 
two games. "We really played ex-
ceptionally well." 

The third game proved to be a 
pivotal turning point in the match. 
With the score locked at 8·S in 
UCSD's favor, the Anteaten made 
a number of oUlstanding plays and 
caught fire emotionally. 

"They were yeUing and sc:ieam-
ina and trying to pick fish" after 
every point," Dannevik said. "'The 
refs did a poor job of keeping them 
under control." 

The Tritons were unable to slow 
UCl's momentum tbrousbout the ' 
remainder of the third game, and 
althoup UCSD play improved in 
game four, its hitting percentage 
plummeted to a dismal .119.

Shepard Adds Name to N CAAs 
UCSD INVITE: Tritons qualify three more atpletes for Nationals over the weekend 
By TecId LacId 
Staff Writer 

Midway through Saturday's 
1994 UC San Diego Invitational, it 
seemed the only ones enjoying the 

THHCK 
l~; 
FIELD 

constant rain 
were the five 
goldfish 
swimming in 
the steeple-
chase pond. 

Almost on 
cue, however, 
the sun poked 
through the 
clouds in time 
to shed light on 
some of the 
strongest Tri-
ton perfor-

mances of the entire season. 
The UCSD squad was led by a 

triad of dazzling NCAA qualifiers 
- veteran Michaela Monahan, up-
start Lisa Shepard, and long-dis-
tance guru J.1. Castner. 

"We had some great perfor-
mances at this meet," Head Coach 
Tony Salerno said. "We're seeing 
people start to peak." 

Monahan accomplished a hat 
trick of sorts by grabbing an NCAA 
qualifying mark, selling a personal 
best, and rewriting the school record 
books with a time of 1 :04.49 in the 
400-meter hurdles. 

Freshman Lisa Shepard ran side-
by-side with world-caliber athlete 
Lucy De Conceicano in the 100-
meter hurdles and captured an 
NCAA entry with a time of 15.38. 

No newcomer to awards, 
NCAA-bound 1.1. Castner bested 
his previous qualifying time in the 
5,000 meters with a solid effort on 
the track. 

"This meet was going to happen 
rain or shine," Salerno said. "You 
can't just tell 1,500 people to go 
home." 

Gliding between the raindrops in 
the open races were BOO-meter spe-
cialist Alan Grant (first in 1 :55.27), 
200-meter sprinter Joe Cavan (third 
in 23.87), and l,500-meter runner 
Mall Ringer (second in 4:04.44). 

"[Grant's] 800-meter race was a 
real good time," said Salerno. "It 
was a seasonal best for him." 

Other Triton standouts in open 
races included James Wiley (11.70) 
and Terri Paulauskas (13.94) in the 
100 meters, Greg Kogut (4:16.5) 
and Mark "Ladka" Vargas (4:19.6)

"The match was ugly on both 
sides," Yarnell said of the 7-6, 7-5 
setback. "I just didn't capitalize on 
my chances." 

Playing at the numbe~-three spot, 
senior Roy Gessford appears to be 
the only singles player hitting well 
during the team's recent losing 
streak. Gessford upped his team-
leading record to 9-3 with a 6-2, 6-

In tbe number-four position, 
Robby Ho was also in full control, 
coming away with a 6-4, 6-3 vic-
tory.

The Tritons also racked up nu-

Sleenhof chalked up fourth- and

Steve Seargeant, the brother of 
former Triton star Scott, jumped to

teammate Nick Bertino's 6'0" ef-

"I'm real happy to have a meet at

The invites, which included a 
large Austraiian contingent, and ath-
letes from Brazil and lapan, raised 
the level of competition for the

The Tritons also enjoyed excep-

LHUll 
The Truth 
About Soccer 

With all the hype surrounding 
{ the World Cup soccer champion-

ship, I feel it 's important to 
enlighten readers and fans alike as 
to what soccer is really all about. 

Simply put, it 's boring. 
Of all the sports played today 

- the golf tournaments, bowling 
matches, arena football games and 
tennis exhibitions - soccer is the 
absolute worst both to watch and 
to play, and I' ll tell you why. 

First, in soccer there 's never 
enough scoring. I'd rather be 
subjected to curling competitions 
or marble matches than have to 
"ooh" and "ahh" at long-haired 
sweaty men (and women) mulling 
around in the middle of an 
enormous field doing absolutely 
nothing. 

The fact is that people like to 
see scoring, and soccer just 
doesn' t deliver. At the last World 
Cup championships, the winning 
team won by an astonishing 
outPl!t of something like 1.3 goals 
a game. Brooke Shields scores 
more than that. 

Second, there 's no true strategy 
in soccer. At least in football 
there are plays and commentators. 
There are strategists peering from 
atop glassed-in booths. There are 
screaming, armchair quarterbacks 
yelling for the "flea flicker." 

In soccer, all you have to do is 
get the ball into the net. Sure, 
there's the "offsides trap" and 
various positions, but let 's be 
honest, - while you could fool 
someone with a reverse, you're 
not going to fake someone out of 
his jock strap with an "offsides 
trap." 

Third, soccer is just too 
dangerous. I'm not talking about 
for the players, I'm talking about 
for the fans. 

In Britain, there was the great 
soccer-fence massacre that killed 
hundreds of fans. Last night on 
the news I saw a Brazilian ref run 
away from a horde of crazed 
soccer junkies. It ought to be 
dangerous to score a goal - like 
in a real sport like hockey - not 
to watch a game. 

Fourth, soccer is just too 
simple. Any self-respecting sports 
fan likes to pour over stats, asking 
questions to pals like, "Did you 
know that tbe Dodgers play best at 
night on artificial turfl" 

Soccer has no complex stats. 
When aJJ you have is two boring 
goals, two teams, a baJJ, and no 
equipment, I guess that happens.

UCSD Manages Fourth in Cal Cup· 
CREW CUSSIC: Both the Triton men's and women's ~quads rowed to fourth-place marks in Saturday's Cal Cup 
By Brllln K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Last weekend's 21st annual San Diego Crew 
Classic turned out to be a rousing success de-
spite mother nature's intended interference. 

Frigid waters, 
gusting easterly 
win d s , 
intermittant 
drizzle and ruth-
less tides failed 
to put a damper 
on one of the 
nation 's biggest 
regattas of the 
year. _ 

The regatta, 
held off the 
sometimes iII-re-
puted shores of 

Mission Bay, had competitors from all over the 
United States at their wit 's end dealing with the 

harshness of a less-than-balmy San Diego race 
weekend. 

"It was rainy, wet, cold and the wind was 
blowing all over the place," Triton women's 
Head Coach Jack Vallerga said. "ltbought I was 
in Seattle. Mission Bay didn't do anything to 
improve its reputation. Nevertheless, UCSD 
had a solid weekend of racing." 

While the "grand-daddy of all awards" for 
both Triton men's and women's crew rested in 
the coveted Cal Cup, the nation's elite men's 
and women's squads had their sights set on the 
Whittier and the Copley Cups, respectively. 

The University of Washington women's 
squad repeated as Whittier Cup Champions, 
crossing the finish line about one-half a boat 
length ahead of runner-up UC Berkeley. 

Harvard University survived a late come-
back attempt by the Huskie men to snare the 
Copley Cup. 

"Harvard looked really sharp today," 
Vallerga said. "Washington exerted a great late 

effort, but Harvard appeared to be in control the 
whole way." 

The Triton JV men's squad quickly found out 
what life in the fast lane entails when its junior 
varsity version of the Cal Cup failed to draw 
enough entries. As a result, UCSD was bumped 
up a couple of classes into another visitor's event 
heat which included national powerhouses 
Harvard, Cal, Orange Coast and Oregon State. 
UCSD put in a valiant effort, but alas, rounded 
out tbe field. 

"They went into the race with their accelera-
tor to the floor," men's Head Coach Doug 
Thiemann said. "They had nothing to lose. The 
only shot we had was to go like hell out of the 
start and hope to hold o~ at the end." 

"We had a foraging start but ran out of gas. 
[The guys) were very happy to say that they went 
stroke for stroke with some of the best teams in 
the nation for a while."

UCSD's Struggles Continue as Redlands Bounces Tritons, 6-3 
SWMPING: Triton men's tennis team's recent slump jeopardizes its shot at an NCAA Tournament bid 
By Murall Moorthy 
Staff Writer 

The post-season clock is tick-
ing, and time is running out for the 
UCSD men's tennis team to prove 
that it can play with the big boys lit 
the National Championships in 
May. 

Friday's road loss to the Uni-

versity of Redlands put the Tri-
tons' collective backs to the wall 
and left tbe team struggling for 
answers, worried that it might be 
left out of post-season play for the 
first time in nine years. The 6-31055 
was the fourth in a row for the 
slumping Tritons. 

The singles play did not give the 

team the early lead it has become 
accustomed to enjoying during its 
seven-game win streak, a streak 
that is now a distant memory. 

The Tritons' top gun, John 
Cross, w~ unable to pmer a win, 
dropping out in two sets, 6-4, 6-1 to 
Redlands' Todd Born. 

"Born is ranked in the top five, 

[but) John played pretty well," said 
Coach Tim Ditzler of his number-
one player. 

Teammate Vern Yarnell, play-
ing in the number-two spot, could 
not find a rhythm in his lou, aI-
thou ... his match was close on' the 
scoreboard.
