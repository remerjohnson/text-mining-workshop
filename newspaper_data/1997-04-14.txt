~Prospective Students Visit UCSD on Annual 'Admit Day' 
TOURS: UCSD courts 
this fall 's potential 
freshman class 
By Ad8m Nichols 
Staff Writer 

Campus officials rolled out the 
red carpet for nearly 5,()()() admit-
ted freshmen and their families on 
Saturday in an attempt to convince 
them to attend in the fall . 

Approximately 4,800 high 
school seniors - out of 13,100 
admits - attended UCSD's annual 
Admit Day. Admissions officials 

anticipate that roughly 3, I ()() of 
those admitted will ultimately 
enroll for classes in the fall. 

According to Nancy Saint John, 
senior publications coordinator for 
the Office of Admissions and 
Outreach, Admit Day is designed to 
help prospective students get a 
sense of what UCSD represents in 
terms of academics, athletics and 
overall campus life. 

"Really, the ultimate goal is to 
get those students who really want 
to go here 10 enroll," Saint John 
said. "The purpose is to showcase 

t~ beautiful campus, services for 
.. ...... ...... .. .. ..... ...... . . . ... .. ....... . .. ,. 

students, academic departments, 
student organizations and the 
wealth of resources the university 
has to offer." 

Muir College Dean Chips 
Dreilinger said presenting a frank 
approach to life at each of UCSD's 
five colleges is an imponant goal 
for Admit Day planners. 

"We want to represent the col-
lege in an honest way," Drcilinger 
said. "We want the people who 
would be happy here to realize it. .. 
the goal is to help the potential 
admit decide if they and Muir 
College are a good match or not." 

The fact that such a large num-
ber of prospective students attend-
ed is in itself commendable, said 
Assistant Vice Chancellor for 
Enrollment ManagementlRegistrar 
Richard Backer. 

"You've done one of the wiS(st 
things you could in thr decision 
making process," Backer said in a 
welcoming speech. "You' lle visiled 
the campus." 

In the welcoming session, 
Associated Students l'residcnt 
Coleen Sabatini offered advice to 
the recent admits.

regents that the energy of UCS D's

"We are not j ust a bunch of 
nerd here." Dynes said. "We have 
some truly creati ve people." 

Dynes addcd that he sees 
UCSD's mission as " not to cram 
lots of knowledge and thoughts 
into students, " but instead to teach 
them how lo think . 

" You're looki ng at the why I 
love UCSD and that's the stu-
dents," he said. 'Thi s is the future, 
ri ght here." 

After lunch, the regents boarded

tions by arts and humanities Dean

You can see now 
why at the regents'

excited about this 
place. "

non-assuming person to be around. 
He doesn' t take himself all that

The day ended with a reception

Those Who Ended Their Lives in Rancho 
Santa Fe Had Odd Beliefs, but We Have 
Little Reason to Pry into Their Activities 
By Mark P.skowltz 
Staff Writer 

Local news broadcasters wasted no time 
starting continuous coveragc of the mass 
suicides in Rancho Santa Fe du~ing the last 
week of March. Reponers " live" on the 
scene fed every scrap of information they 
could get their hands on back to their anchor 
desks. Soon, thc news fecds went out 
nationally. Broadcasters spread the tricklc of 
inforrnatl on thin, in all a!lcmpt to providc 
"continuous coverage of thi s breaking 
,tory." The "Heaven's Gate" cult sui cide 
virtually monopoli/.cd m:w, coverage. 

Onc rcpol1er aft er another began with 
"Now, we don't want to specul ate ... " and 
then fo llowed with ,Ollle wi ld ~pecul a tl on a, 

to the meaning behind the suicides. A st ream 
of expert flowed through network studios 
explaining the psychology of cults, the his-
tory of comets or the idcas behind millenni -
um movcments. Aftcr a few days, the irony 
shifted as reporters, sti ll "comi ng to us li ve," 
info rmed us that the residents of the area 
just wantcd things to get back to normal. 

Despite this seemi ngly endless coverage, 
onc question was never addressed: Why 
docs a cult suicide merit so much a!lcntion? 
The numher of deaths, 39, might seem suffi -
cient to make thi s a newsworthy topic. 
Howe ver, throughout the world. vastl y larg-
er numhcrs of people are involved in situa-

t io n~ that get l11uc h Ie,s attenti on.

COMMENTARY: The interviews that the Guardian conducted with candidates for A.S. positions proved to be 
very illuminating and much more educational than written statements or membership on a particular slate 

MANY A.S. CANDIDATES DID NOT HAVE A CLUE 
By Meg .. Klein 
ASSOCIate Opinion Editor 

A,S. elections carne and went 
la t week . and with them the 
Gl1ardian editorral board 's 
endorsement s. This is my second 
year at UCSD. bUI thi s was onl y 
my first year interViewing and get-
ting to know A.S . candidates per-

~onall y. It was, to say the lea ·t. a 
learning experience. 

The Guardian interviewed all 
the candidates for A.S. president , 
vice presidents and commissioners 
- more than 20 people in all. At 15 
minutes each interview - except 
for the presidents, who had 30 -
the Gllardian spent seven or eight 
hours just interviewing, to say 
nothing of debating and writing the 
endorsement . The interviews werc 
conducted by the editorial board 
and a handful of other staffers. 
some of who h<ld extensive A.S. 
ex perience. 

Each candidate wa asked ques-
tions based on his or her statements 
in the A.S . election pamphlet about 
the position for which they were 
vying. Over two days of intcr-

view~, I learned more about the 
candidates from talking to them 
than I ever could have by just read-
ing their written statements. I now 
wonder how anyone can make an 
informcd decision based solely on 
the A.S. elec tion pamphlet.

inSlead want to vote for whoever 
can think up the li veliest catch -
phrase. 

ow I realize that if I hadn ' t 
heen there for the intcrview , I cer-
tainly would have become one of 
the wayward voters who based 
their deci ions on the often mis-
leading pamphlet. 

Thc interviews 'howed a side of 
e.tch candidate that I would not 
have discovered by reading the 
handout. Not only did I learn about 
issues other than those the candi-
dates addressed in their statements, 
hut I al 0 learned more ahout their 
personalitics, demeanors and their 
motivations behind running for 
office. 

Some candidares. who appe<lred 
extremely qualified <lnd full of 
ideas, also lacked much-needed 
chari sma for their positi ns. The 
,tudent-advocacy commi sioner is 
one position that needs somcone 
who has a spark ling, outgoing per-
sonality bet;ause that oflicer has to 
be very approachahle. 

One candidate, though sounding 
charming and skilled in the A.S. 
pamphlet, turned out to be simply 
boring and dreary in person. After 
the interview, I could not imaginc 
that candidate as a successful advo-
cate.

Many had never even been to an

toward working with the ~tudent

didate had to admit Ihat the had

located if they were elected . 

nforlunately, for many of 
these candidme . at least a year of 
ac tu al A.S. cxperience i ' needed 
for thelll to evcn be considered as 
likely candidates. It is importan t for 
the good of the studen t hody that 
the elected candidales understand 
and arc already familiar with the 
workings of Ihe A. . before start ing 
a new year in their office. All I c<ln

Slates were also hig this year. 
We had three: Revolution. Student 
First! and the lesser-known 
Firestarters. At their best. slates c<ln 
be an exce llent tool for uniting 
ideas and candidates. hUI Ihis year 
they were used for covering up 
inexperience and imbecility. 

One slate in particular hccame a 
front for several c,lIldidates with 
ahso lutely no experience among 

them. The perception seems to be 
that candidates attached to a slate 
somehow automatically become 
more qualified. 

Those with no A.S. background 
assume that ,I slate at;ts somehow 
like a magic wand. dousing each 
candidate with a plethora of the 
skills ncccssary for the office. This 
is dangerous hoth for the student 
body if they arc elected and for the 
candidates who do not understand 
what they are getting into. This is 
what happened last year: More than 
half a dozen of those students elect-
ed last year on the tudents First! 
slare have resigned their omee .. 

Sometimes I wonder ahout some 
of the people at thi s school. Do Ihey 
undersland what il means to be 
involved in student government" Do 
they understand the commitment 
<lnd the tim' it takes after the elec-
tion-time glory is gone? How many 
candidates actually realize that th y 
have to go to A.S. l11'etings" Whal 
ahout unsuspecting students who 
aimlessly votc solely based on the 
A.S. pamphlet? Do they know what 
is actua lly going on? 

So next year. I am going to 
inVite c cry one to the GIIClrdia" 
editoria l board interviews. Only hy 
meeting the candidates and seei ng 
what happens when thcy actua ll y 
stan talk ing can studcnts make a 
fair decision . So come one, come

"Students

disappointed with 
the result, of the

"Revolut ion" will 
dominate the coun-

"It wasn't

"You must develop your own 
character. as well as your knowl-
edge of what others have written," 
Sabatini said. 

In addition to the university-
wide Admit Day activities coordi-
nated by the Office of Admissions 
and Outreach, each of the live col-
leges planned its own activities. 

Every college had academic 
advising tables and representatives 
from student organizations. In 
addition to the traditional speeches 
and information sessions, Revelle 
College staged a carnival complete 
with music and a dunk lank, 

"I thought the opening speeches 
were pretty good," said Phillip 
Chou, a student from Corvallis, 
Oregon. "[Revelle] looks like it's 
the most competitive; they have a 
lot of humanities classes." 

Several student volunteers said 
they were also impressed with the 
outcome of this year's Admit Day. 

"II gives [the prospective stu-
dents) a sense of security or 
insight," said Revelle sophomore 
Pranav Patel. 

Muir College featured a live 
band, a sidewalk sale outside of 
M.O.M. (the Middle of Muir) and 
various activities in the Muir quad. 

"I've decided that I'm going to 
come here .. . I was just impressed 
by how mueh this is an intellcctual

Marshall College staged its 19th

and college tours, featuring llama 
rides and carnival booths with 
food, T-shins and an.

The Collect Call 

Warren College 's Admit Day, 
located on the Warren Mall in front 
of the Warren Lecture Halls, was 
distinguished by a giant Twister 
game, a "Name That TV Show" 
game, a jazz band and a barbecue. 

College staff members and vol-
unleers were on hand throughout 
Admit Day to answer prospective 
students' questions. 

"Students want to know what 
we do ... I stayed with them until 
they didn't have any more ques-
tions ," tour guide Justin 
Ruthenbeck said. "It seems they 
really like the live-college system." 

Several prospective students 
said the tours gave them a greater 
insight into what made UCSD dif-
ferent than the other UC campuses.

"[Admit Day] gave me a chance to

In keeping with its international 
focus, Roosevelt College dubbed 
its Admit Day fair "Windows to the 
World." 

"[Student response] has been 
good," tour guide Eric Bankston 
said. '"They look up to you, because 
you're a college guy. You're there 
- they' ll believe you." 

Many admits said UCSD's col-
lege system was a particular draw 
for them. 

"I like the five-college cam-
pus ... I was really attracted to it ," 
said Amanda Trevizo of Upland, 
who added that she liked UCSD's 
unified nature better than the dis-
jointed Claremont Colleges.

"There were really no major 
significant changes in the constitu-
tion; we were really just trying to 
clean it up and clarify some of the 
job descriptions so that it really laid 
out a more appropriate description 
of what each of these offices are 
supposed to be doing, because it 
has changed over the last several 
years," Sabatini said. 

Students overwhelmingly -
87.4 percent- supponed the non-
binding referendum intended to 
determine students' opinion of a 
possible move to NCAA Division 
II. 

"I was surprised at the over-
whelming amount of yes's." 
Sabati ni said. " I expected some-
thing a little more split. I just really 
hope this serves as a catalyst for 
further di scussion on this issue 
over the next year." 

The two fee referenda on the 
ballot - a 70-cent-per-quarter 
"lock-in" fee for UC and U.S. 
Student A sociation dues and a $4 
per quaner spons fee - failed to 
garner the requircd two-thirds 
majority vote. 

Each co llege's voters also chose 
thei r respective A.S. senators. 

Revelle students elected Denise 
La Cou rsicre as scnior senator, the 
unopposed April Alex as junior 
senator and Tam Nguyen ~s sopho-

Muir student s elected unop-
posed Chris Norris as senior sena-
tor and David Kleinbrodt as junior

senator; that position will ' be lilled 
at a later date. 

From Marshall co llege, Mark

Managing Editor 

Drawing the 
Ad Line 

Where do you draw the line? 
Every week. the Guardian 
receives request by companies 
and groups to run every type of 
advertisement imaginable . How 
we as a staff decide what makes it 
into print i an interesting process 
that in many ways gives insight 
into how we define our role as a 
newspaper. 

Recently. an anti -abortion 
group indicated that it wanted to 
run an insert entitled Site 's a Child, 
Not a "Choice" in a future issue 
of the Guardian . As many of our 
readers already know, the insert 
has run in past years. Un like most 
ad requests, however, this one 
causes a considerable amou nt of 
consternation every year both in 
the papcr 's bu siness office and 
among the gcneral staff. 

The Guardian is not used to 
running advertisemcnts of a 
political or moral slant. When we 
do recei ve requests to run 
controversial ads. the executi ve 
board, compri sed of editors at the 
Guardian , is charged with 
evaluating them on a case- by-case 
basis. 

Luckily, the staff is rarely 
forced into such a position ; 
likewise, our policy toward 
advertisers is eldom a concern 
among the executive board. In 
many ways. that reflects our status 
as a newspaper supported solely 
by advcrtising . We fully 
understand that without 
advertisers, there would be no 
Guardian . Why then would we 
ever refuse an ad? 

I can only answer that questi on 
as a single staff member, though I 
am confident that most others here 
sharc my opinion . In my view, the 
Guardian has a responsibility to 
its readers, advertisers and 
contributor not to run material 
that most people would find 
offensi vc or obscene. 
Furthermore, we have an 
obli gation to our readers not to run 
letters or adverti semen ts that 
contain patently fal se .claims. 

As a staff, we have instituted an 
ad policy that prohibits our 
business office from accepting ads 
from strip cl ubs, sex lines, 
pyramid schemes and the like. The 
staff in past years has also refused 
to run several inserts, including 
one denying that the Holocaust 
ever happened and another 
promoting a manlboy love society. 

While I don ' t mean to lump 
anti -abortionists in with 
pedophiles and Neo-Nazis , we 
must now decide whether (0 run 
another controversial abortion 
insert: namely, a paid 
advertisement that contains 
graphic descriptions of various 
abortion procedures, as well as 
photographs of aborted fetuses. 

The insert also contai ns a brief 
description of the developmental 
process in the womb, a legal 
history of abortion. per onal

THE TOWN SIGN 
UCSD Graduate Students Art Project Serves as Symbol of 
Mexican Communitys Strength in Unity During Struggles 

A.newt", the Contract: A graduate student's art project is a tangible means for residents 
of "Maclovio Rojas," a community based In Tecate, Mexico, to signify community member-
ship. Men, women and children of the community also signed the wooden letters In memo-
ry of Rojas, a labor organizer who was killed during a protest. 

Story by Nicki Lee, Guardian Reporter 

On April 6 a small , relativcly obscure comm unity in Tecate celebrated its triumphant existence on a piece of real estatc that, only nine years ago 
had been abandoned. Scores of people dri fled 
into the co mmunity center to sign their names 
on pieces of wood that spell the initials of a 
deceased community leader. This is where the 
story begins - again t the backdrop of 
parched and dusty hi lis . 

The town is bordered on one side by a 
barbed-wi re fence that separates the 
community from neatly formed lines of white 
truck parts. The rest of the ci ty is surrounded 
by rolling brown hills and a small unpaved dirt 
road. At first glance, it might be easy to 
romanticize the scene. 

However, a closer look reveals otherwise. 
The small shanties - constructed from 
everyday elements such as cardboard, leftover 
scraps of metal , flimsy pieces of dry wood and 
dark maroon bricks - are homes for large 
families that subsist without the common 
amenities of electricity, indoor pl:.::nbing or 
heal. Such squalor is not an unfami liar sight in 
Tijuana, home to Mexico 's maquiladora 
industry. 
Maquiladora Worker. 

Today, Hyundai factories and numerous 
other industrial plants fill the space near and 
around this community. Many members of thi 
vi lIage work in maquiladoras, foreign-owned 
businesses that import the various parts of 
automobi les, televisions, medical supplies and 
clothing duty-free and develop them into 
eventual finished products . Mo t of these will 
then be taken across the border after a minimal 
tax is imposed. 

Young women comprise the majority of the 
900,000 maquiladora workers , If they are 
lucky. they receive a monthly paycheck of 
$150. Most of the time, they are paid much 
less.

What Do You Think About 

Ellen's "Coming Out"? 
Interviews by Grace Jang 

Photography by Claire Schneider 

It 's wrong to discriminate 
against somebody for their 
sexuality just on principle. 
It 's also ex tremely stupid for 
sponsors to be pulling out 
because people really like her 
and she has a really popular 
show. 

Rene Hayden 
History Graduate Student 

People should get over 
homosex uality being such a 
big deal. Just let people do 
what they want to do. I don't 
understand why people want 
to intrude on others' lives 
when it reall y doesn't have 
anything to do with them. 

Sylvia Taylor 
Marshall Senior 

It 's like when Murphy 
Brown was attacked for 
being a si ngle mother. The 
medi a's attacking Ellen 
because it's something to talk 
about. In that sense it's a 
"milestone." The media just 
needs something to hype, 

Alexis Brandow 
Warren Junior 

It will help others strug-
gling with thei r sex uality to 
see that someone as positive 
as Ellen can help them under-
stand their own feelings . 
Advertisers who are pulling 
out are mi ss ing out on a 
human .rights issue.

their names on this billboard is a 
way for members to renew their 
contract as members of the 
community, Mydlack says. The 
different script styles of each 
signature reflects the diversity of 
the people themselves. Yet at the 
same time, by all signing upon 
the name of one of their their 
greate t leaders , they are 
expressing unity. 

"These people don 't know 
how inspiring or exceptional they 
are," Mydlack sa id. "They have 
something to give to others 
whether it is their inspiration or 
thei r art. Now they finally have 
an opportunity to give." 

This art project differs from 
many others of its kind, Myd lack 
said : Most other border art 
projects are sponsored by wealthy 
advocates. and the commissioned 
artists are encouraged to create 
puhlic scu lpturc ~ protected frolll 
vandalism and graffiti . Mydlack's 
projec t, however, is an 
independent one that aro e from 
the comm unity and largely 
depended on community 
assis tance. 

Members of the Maclovio 
Rojas community are committed 
to preserving thei r home, a ta k 
undertaken without the aid of 
telephones or electricity. Indeed, 
it is a battle that they must wage 
despite the debilitating effects of 
malnutrition and ex haustion, in 
the face of considerable odds. 
They have made efforts to obta in. 
ownership rights to thei r land, 
struggled to increase the visibili ty 
of the plight of maquiladora 
workers and, throughout , have 
maintained trength through 
unity. 

Myd lack's project will be 
ex hibi ted at the Library Walk 
fro m April 21 -26 and then 
returned to Mexico to be installed 
as the Maclovio Rojas town sign. 
Hernandez and other community 
leaders will hold a conference on 
Thurs., April 24 at 6 p.m. to 
discuss the projec t and their 
community. 

SOAPBOX: 
Abortion ad sparks 
controversy 
Continued from lNCe 9 
abortion and a li st of various 
resources to help with crisis 
pregnancies . As would be 
expected, the information is not 
presented in an objective manner, 
and is sprinkled with terms such 
as "abortion mills." But it is 
clearly marked a an 
advertisement, and also never 
claims to present both sides of the 
issue. It obviously contai ns very 
biased, one-sided commentary, 
but should it be rejected for this 
alone? 

I think the answer to that has a 
lot to do with our unique role as 
the only mainstream newspaper 
on campus and our particular 
audience. We could render the 
whole debate urrounding the 
anti -abortion insert moot by just 
refusing to run all 
"controversia l" adverti ing, but I 
think by doing so, we would be 
doing a disservice to our readers 

The UCSD Guardian 

and ignoring our special role here 
at UCSD. 

One of our roles as the main 
campus newspaper is to promote 
discussion, whatever the form . 
While [ think the Guardian has a 
responsibility to its readers, 
advertisers and contributors not 
to print obscene or offensi ve 
material, it also should not censor 
the concerns of an anti-abonion 
group. I have a di fficull ti me 
convincing myself that we need 
to protect our readers and 
adveni ers from any discussion 
of a major moral or social issue, 
even if that discussion is 
presented in an obviously biased 
manner. 

Our audience - college 
students - can and should be 
able to make their own decisions, 
so why not expose them to all 
relevant material ? If it makes 
them think or question their 
beliefs, I think something has 
been gai ned. 

At the risk of sounding 
arrogant : If you cannot 
distinguish between fact and 
fiction , and if you lack the abi lity 

• 
to process information from many 
different and frequently 
conflicting sources .before 
coming to a conclusion - or you 
are so insecure in your beliefs 
that you object to hearing an 
opposing viewpoint- you really 
do not belong in college. Pro-
choice, pro-life, ambivalent: I 
encourage you to expose yourself 
to all sides of the debate. How 
can you make an informed 
decision about anything without 
knowing the arguments of both 
ides? 

My objections to the insert 
therefore do not lie with the 
arguments or opinions contained 
therein. Rather, I am concerned 
with the graphic nature of some 
of the photographs and 
descriptions of various abortion 
techniques. While I would only in 
the most extreme cases (such as 
the aforementioned in ert that 
denied the Holocaust) refuse to 
run an ad or leiter because of its 
controversial content. I would 
object to running an ad that 
contains graphic image of, say, 
sexual or vio lent acts. I think 

FEAllJRES 13 

most Guardian staffers would 
agree with me. 

The challenge that faces us at 
our next staff meeting is deciding 
whether this panieular insen 
crosses the line. It 's a difficult 
question that really is centered on 
what we see as our 
responsibilities to the campus and 
community. We must balance our 
obligations to our readers, 
advertisers and contributors with 
our mission to promote 
discussion and knowledge of the 
issues.

Road-Weary Tritons Plow Ahead 
POSTSEASON: UCSD needs to win every remaining contest to reach the 
playoffs after losing four straight games on the road at sec and Chapman 
By Kevin Mclaughlin 
Senior Staff Wflter 

Traveling can really take its toll on 
you. It· s physicall y drai ning. not to 
mwntion costly intimeand moncy. In 

the realm of athletics, 
traveling means pl!ly-
ing on an unfamiliar 
fi eld, and faci ng hos-
ti Ie fans and fired-up 
opponents. Pl ayi ng 
against strong compe-
tition this week, the 
women's softball team 

had no luck, fim ' hing wi th no victo-
ries. 

Wednesday afternoon, the ladies 
squared off against Southern Califor-
nia Co llege for a doubleheader. 
Though the Vanguards - who came 
into the game with a 11 -27-1 record 
- were nOl highly regarded, they 
came ready to play. 

The opener was a pitcher'S duel. 
Both pitchers threw complete games, 
and neither allowed an earned run. 
However, the Vanguards scored a run 
in the third inning on a passed ball. 
saddling Kristin Schueler with a 1-0 
loss. 

UCSD had scoring opportunities, 
including having runners at second 
and third with one oul. But because of 
some bad luck and poor baserunnin'g, 
the team failed to capitalize. 

' 'They had good pitching, but we 
just didn ' t hit," said outfielder Erin 
Cornell. "If we played them again. I 
think we'd give them a run for their 
money." 

'nlings would only gel worse in 
the second game. Erin Flanigan was 
touched for one run in the first inning 
on an infield single. Though she wou Id 

yield no more, that hit proved to be too 
much. 

Gretchen Brandt si lenced the Tri -
tons' bats. hurl ing a complete-game 
no-hi tter. An error and a walk gave the 
Tritons only two bascrunners in the 
ent ire game, and the women left with 
another 1-0 loss. 

"We didn ' t play poorly, but we 
didn ' t execute," Triton Head Coach 
Patricia Gerckens said. "We' regoing 
through a lillie bit of a slump right 
now," 

Perhaps the ladie ' were looking 
ahead to Saturday's doubleheader 
against Chapman, probably the best 
team on the West Coa I. Toe women 
tangled with the Panther a week ear-
lier at the Powerbar Softball Classic, 
losing late in the game. Eager for 
revenge and another chance again t 
excellent competition. they traveled 
north on Saturday to play two more. 

Chapman lit up the scoreboard 
early. registering three runs in both 
the fi rst and third innings. The Pan-
thers wouldn 't score again. The Tri-
tons mustered only three hits in the 
game, though two of tho e hits were 
so lo home runs, blasted overthe fence 
by Erin Bridges and Christina Scar-
ing. Those two runs would be all the 
women scored in the 6-2 loss. 

For the second game. Kri stin 
Schueler moved from first base to 
take the reins o~ the mound against 
the mighty Chapman 
bats. This move proved 
to be a sagacious deci-
sion on t he part of 
Gerckens, as Schueler 
was superlative. She al-
lowed only one run go-
ing into the seventh in-

ning, and was staked to a 2- I lead in 
the sixth inning on consecuti ve RBI 
singles. 

In the bottom of the eventh. 
Schueler allowed a walk , which 
brought the winning run to the plate in 
the person of Stephanie Carew. Lead-
ing Di v. ill in home runs, the slugger 
teed off fo r her 12th home run on the 
year to bring her team a 3-2 victory. 

"We went into these games giving 
our best and playing with heart." 
Gerckens said. " It just comes down to 
one bad pitch. Kri stin had pitched a 
flawless game. We made plays, we 
played heads up and we won every 
inning but the last one. I thought we 
had them beat." 

Pitcher Mary Jane Ouo agreed. 
"We were getting hits and we just 

couldn ' t finish," Otto said. "We played 
an awesome game. Wedominatedthe 
whole way and we had them beal. It 
says a lot about where we are now, to 
almo t beat thi very good team." 

Dropping to 20- 14 on the season, 
the women need to win the remainder 
of their games to advance to the 
post sea on. Next up is Uni versity of 
La Verne. a team the Tritons can beat 
if they play up to their abili ties. 

"We' re still playing for the 
postseason," Gerckens said. "I just 
know that we have to beat them (La 
Verne). This team likes pressure. we 
just have to stay focused ." 

No-Cal Trip Yields Another Split 
RONDESTVEDT: Slugger-turned-pitcher turns in a great performance in 
the nightcap of a doubleheader at Menlo, pitching a two-hit shutout 
By Travis Hili 
Co-Associate Sports Edllor 

Baseball of the latc '90's has a 
di stinctl y new fla vo r. Every 
Sportscenter highlight has some I 12-

pound shortstop mus-
cling a low-and-away 
change-up475 feet for 
anopposite-ficld home 
run. The baseball ' are 
juiced. High-altitude 
games produce foot -
ball scores. Despite 
these new disadvan-

tages for the pitcher. the old adage 
remains: Pitching wins champion-
ship . 

Head Coach Robert Fletcher and 
his UCSD squad have found pitching 
to be crucial for their succcss this 
year. When the Tritons get a strong 
outing, they win. When the middle 
re lief is throwing wcll, the Tritons 
win. When the pitching is off, the 
Tri tons find themselves on the wrong 
end of a slugfest. 

Fletcher has tried numerous com-
binationsof starters and relievers. The 
problem is that most of his hurlers 
have good stuff, but not enough expe-
rience to con istently domi nate. 
Michael Bedar, Theo Robins, David 
Takehara, John Willis and Mathew 
Livingston have all started games for 
Fletcher. All have shown great prom-
ise on numerous occasions, but none 
ha done it consistently enough to be 
con idered lm ace. 

Recently, F1etcherinsened another 
taner into the mix , sophomore Chris 

Rondestvedt. He provided the Tritons 
with a couple of great starts, such as 
last Saturday when the Tritons trav-
eled to Menlo College for a double-
header. 

Rondestvedt got the stan in the 
first game. He answered the call, giv-
ing up on ly two meager singles to shut 
out a tough Oaks team. It was the first 
time the Oaks had been shut out in 46 
games. Rondest vedt simply overpow-
ered the team. He had five strikeouts 
and allOWed only two free passes. 

Rondestvedt 's mastery allowed the 
Tritons to be patient on offense. They 
were forced to be patient because the 
Oak hurler was no slouch. He had 
grea! control. allowing no wa lks and 
only one extra-base hit. a double by 
Ryan Hill . 

The Tritons were forced to liule-
ball the Oaks with a barrage of singles, 
acrificcs and steals. Six Triton hitters 

had hits, but only one, Jo eph AliOio. 
had two. Mark Mason jOined Alioto 
in driving in one run. 
That was all the Tritons 
needed for a 2-0 win. 

In the nightcap. the 
Tritons received five 
stellar inning from 
Bcdar, giving up only 
one run. Problemscame 
in the sixth. Bedar be-
gan t tire a bit, and the 
Oaks got to him for 

three. Then Flctcherbrought in Eddie 
Ishak, whose crror allowed another 
run. Ishak then shut the Oaks down in 
the seventh anclthe eighth, throwing 
very well. 

The four-ntn inning changed the 
game from a 2-1 Triton lead to a 5-2 
deficit. UCSD mounted a rally in the 
top of the ninth. but could only pro-
duce one run . The Tritons fell to a 13-
13 record on the year with the5-310ss. 

Offensively. the Tritons produced 
10 hit s, including three from 
Rondestvedtand two apiece from Hill 
and George Escanuelas. Kennith 
Fluharty had the biggest day for the 
Tritons. The ophornore second 
baseman had three hits, a steal and a 
big solo homer. Despite the positive 
output, the Tritons couldn 't conven, 
leaving 13 runners stranded. 

The Tritons continue to improve 
with each game. UCSD learned a 
valuable Ie son last weekend. which 
will be extremely beneficial in its hunt 
for the playoffs: .The team with the 
be t pi tching wins.

JACKIE: A 
model for mankind 
Continued from page 20 
ployer. He constantly received death 
threat . 

Robinson also faced taunts from 
the stand and the other teams. One 
day, Pee Wee Reese. Dodgers shan-
stop and captain, called for time. He 
walked over to put hi s aml around 
Robinson. The black man and white 
southerner stared the opposing dug-
out into , ilence. 

Robinson Icft baseball andbecamc 
invo lved in politics. He always 
stressed integration over separatism. 
He spoke out again t rioting and vio-
lence. sometimes bei ngshouted down 
asan Uncle Tom. Martin Luther King. 
Jr. con idered Robinson a great inspi-
rat ion. once thanking him for making 
his own work "50 easy." 

Reese recall s a conversation with 
Spikc Lee, who wa ' rcsearching for a 
movie about Robinson. "I'm going to 

make this picture tough and hones!.. .. . " 
Lee said. ''This is going to be a bla k 
movie." Reese was disturbed. "Sure 
Jack wa black. But isn't his life story 
black and white? Isn' t it about inte-
gration?" 

For a sense of what the times were 
like, I turned to my dad. He was a kid 
growing up in Brooklyn when 
Robinson made his debut. 

"The Dodgers were not merely a 
baseball team in Brooklyn. They were 
part of a culture. The Dodgers unified 
the diverse mini -cultures into a uni -
fi ed group ... at least during the base-
ball sea on. Robin 'on was a big deal 
to me and everyone [ knew ... He was 
part of an underelass who became a 
hero in the Brooklyn culture. Blacks 
and whites didn' t socialize much in 
those days. it seems to me, but we all 
rallied around the Dodgers, Reese, 
Snyder, Robinson, Cox, etc .... He was 
well- poken, educated, athletic and 
dilferen!.. .1 never met anyone who 
was upset about it. Jackie was simply 
different; kind of like Jim Abbot."

Robinson was often described as 
"a credit to his race." a phrase my 
fat her hated. 

"[That I SlUff was recognition that 
he had more class than wa expected 
from a black guy. Of course. few of 
us knew black guys. It was different 
then. As Campanell a and other 
blacks got info ba eball and other 
sports, the 'c redit to hi s race' tuff 
faded." 

Robinson was not the fi rst black to 
play Major League Ba~eba" . Others 
had played openly in the I 880s. and 
some had claimcd to be Indians, Cu-
bans or Puerto Ri ·ans. or was he the 
fi rst bl ack man in modcrn profes-
sional sport s. The year before 
Robinsonjoined the Dodgers, Kenny 
Washington played football for the 
Los Ange les Rams. Howeve r. 
Robinson was the first black toopenly 
play modem baseball at a time when 
baseball was the only sport that really 
mattered. 

Robinson did not end segregation 
either. During the 25th anni versary 

celebrations of Robinson's first sea-
son, he said that he appreciated the 
honor. but he would be happier when 
he saw a black manager. 

While blacks are now coaching, 
there is sti ll onl y one black GM in 
baseball. Moreover, there ha ' only 
been one black controlling ownerof 
a major American sport franchisc. 
Ex planationsabound - omec laim

inertia . Thc fact remains that blacks 
are poorly represented in the front

started in the right direction. Had he 
not handled himself with uch clas 
and character in the face of such ad-
versity. the course of civi I righl would 
have been set back t.erribly, perhap 
irrevocably. 

Sadly, many people and even 
many ball players today do not know 
who Robinson wa or what he did. 
Hopefully. with all the attention of 
the anniversary , people wi II become 
more aware. We must not allow 
ourselves to forget what he did. He 
was truly a credit to hi s racc - the 
human race. 

"This Regada is an interesting race 
because everyone goes through the 
same thing. You can' t be emotionally 
Il at for thi s race," Vallerga ·aid.

Road Woes Continue UCSD Rows Past 
SDSU in Mission Bay ROUGH RIDE: Coming off a tough trip to Penn ylvannia, the Tritons 

headed north to face powerhouses Univer ity of Pacific and Stanford 
REGADA: For the first time in several years, 
UCSD upset SDSU in men' Varsity-Eight By Steve Walsh Co-Associate Sports Editor 

There's something about playing 
on the road that brings problems to 
the UCS D men's volleyball team. 

Maybe it 's the lack of 
home-cooked meals, 
sleeping in unfamiliar 
bed or the jet lag. 
Whatever the reason, 
the hoysfrom La Jolla 
tend to struggle when 
they leave the fri endly 

_ ..... --- confines of RIMAe. 
While there may 

have been extraneous factors this 
weekend, the Tritom were also head-
ing into the horne gyms of two of the 
most dominant vo lleyball teams in 
the nation. 

Coming off a tough stay in Penn-
sy lvania fOrlhe Divi ion 111 National 

ehampionship~, the Tritons jumped 
out of the frying pan and into the fire 
as they headed north to face the Uni-
versity of Pacific and Stanford Uni-
versity on baek-to-hack nights. 

For the majority of teams across 
the c untry, thi ~ trip wou ld have 
caused their coac he~ to wake up in a 

cold ~weat. However, for CSD the 
trip has become a rite of passage, as 
the lone Division 1JI school in the 
Mountai n Pacific Sports Federation. 

While RIMAC has been the si te 
this year of two of the biggest wins in 
school history, theTritons have found 
the going tough in opposing quaners. 
Friday night was no exception when 

CSD ~quarcd off against Paci fi c. 
When the Tritons faced the Tigers in 
San Diego, they took the game from 
their nallonally ranked gue\ts. How-
ever,inStockton'pacificswept eSD 
in three games. 

Facing a much larger lineup, the 
Tritons were forced to adjust thei r 
offensive att ack to deal with thc enor-

Despite the efforts of those three, 
UCSD struggled to stay do~e with

Thing didn ' t get any better fur 
UCSD when the leam headed to

undefeated season at home by knock-

I f you watch a lot of TV. you've 
probahly laughed at the many con-
fli cts between Homer Simpson and 

ed Flanders. or maybe 
you've taken to hean some 
of the advice that Wilson 
gives Tim Taylor. [f TV' 
n tyourthing, you've most 
cenainly becnsubject to the 
noise made by the rowdy 
group living in the apan-
ment above you. The point 

i~ that everyone. at one time 
or another, has experienced some 
form of neighborly interaction. 

On Saturday, at the annual San 
Diego Ci ty Championship Regada 
held in West Mission Bay. the 
UCSD Crew Team engaged in 
competition against its neighbo r~. 
The Tritons have a friendly cros -
town rivalry go ing among them-
selves, the San Diego State Altecs 
and the Uni versi ty of San Di ego 
Torerros. 

SDSU was upset in the Men's Var-
ity-Eight race. The Triton raced to 

an overwhelming three boat-length 
victory ovcr the Aztecs. 

In the Women's Varsity-Eight 
race, the Aztecs ha ve domi -
nated for the past two years 
- and this streak did not end 
on Saturday. De pite a val-
iant effort , the Lady Triton 
didn't fare very well, fini sh-
ing in third place behind the 
Aztecs and the Torerros. 

CSD made up for its 
shortcoming in the Varsity-

Eight race with a so lid victory in 
the ovice-Eight event. For the 
first time in two years the Triton 
women won thi s race by defeating 
the Al.tecs. Lasl weekend at the 
San Diego Crew Classic, the Tri-
tons beat SDSU by only 0.5 sec-
onds, but thi s time the margin of 
victory was almost fi ve seconds. 

The Men's Novice-Eight 
proved to be a close race for the 
Tritons, who finished second be-
hind the Torerro .

"There 's no animosity between

Coach Jack Vallerga said. "It's an 

IOten~e ri va lry and we all want to 
win. but it' s we ll -controlled. And 
even if you don' t win, you still 
show up for the awards hanquet 
aft erwards." 

Followi ng the Eight-races were 
the Four-race in which the team 
races only half of its crew - four 
rowers and a coxswain. Both the

Sagehens Singled Out at Muir Courts 
SINGLE SWEEP: UCSD grabbed six singles matches in a 6-1 thumping of Pomona-Pitzer after dropping all doubles contests 
By Nicole Vargas 
Senior Staff Writer 

Hey, Pomona- Pit7er: Don ' t mes. 
with the UCSD men '~ tcnnis team. 

The Tritons may have lost the 
dou bles point to the 
Sagehcns yesterday, 
but it wa UCSD that 
redeemed itselri nthe 
end by sweeping ev-
ery si ngles match in 
the 6- 1 victory ovcr 
Pomona-Pitzer. 

Th e Sage hens 
started off the com-

petition by dereating all three of the 
Triton doubles pairs. The top-seeded 
duo of Steve Shabel and Ben Becker 
lost 8-6. as did No.2 tandem Emil 
Mihet and Mike Rosetl. [n the third-
eeded match, Anthony Melicharek 

and Dave Murphy didn ' t fare much 
better, falling 9-7. 

" For doubles, we need more ser-
vice returns in the court , more vol-
leys and more aggressive play from 
the net man." Head Coach Brian 
Turner said. "To sum that al l up, we 
need to eliminate our mistakes." 

Against that type of momentum, 
one might Ihink that the UCSD squad 
was in trouble. Think again . 

Not only did the Tritons take the 
remaining six matches, but two of 
the six competitions were fini shed 
in only two sets. 

"[ thought we might lose acouple 
of matches," Turner said. "But I 
knew we could win since Pomona 
had nothing to lose. I had no idea we 

would win all the singles matches. 
IThe winl se t a go d attitude for us 
going into Regionals." 

Top- eed Shabel defea ted 
agehen Mike Lee, 6-2. 4-6and 6-2, 

while second-seed Mihet ruined 
Jesse Axtell 's day with a 6-1, 2-6, 
and 6-2 upset. 

Both No. 3 Ken Liu and No. 4 
Murphy managed to send thei r 
Pomona-Pitzer foc packing carly. 
winning each match in two sets. Liu 
beat Ken Su, 7-5 and 7-6, while 
Murphy delivered a simi lar upset 
wi th a 6-3 and 7-6 victory . 

o. 5 Ping Yeh and No. 6 Jason 
Hipp each lost their first set, only to 
corne back with wins in each of their 
next two sets. Yeh dereated Paul 
Gilden aftera3-610ss by turning the 
tables and taking hi s last two 
matches. 7-5 and 6-3. Hipp over-
threw Sagehen Nick Bartlett , 2-6. 6-
3 and 6-3. 

With less than a month eparat-
ing UCSD from the Western 
Rcgionals competition, the Tritons 
now are ranked third in the region 
behind UC Santa Cruz and Univer-
ity of Redlands. 

The BulldogsofRedlands sealed 
their pot ahead ofUCSD Saturday, 
when two singles matches were re-
played in La Jolla. In Ihis season's 
earlier match, court assignments 
were confused and the No.5 and 
No. 6 matches had to be resceduled 
for a later date. 

Before Saturday, the Tritons were 
ahead of Redlands, 3-2. However, 

Eye to Eye: It took sophomore sensation Steve Shabel three sets to defeat Pomona's Mike Lee. 

both Bulldogs upset their UCSD 
opponent, giving Redlands the 4-3 
victory. 

With each of these matches be-
hind them, the Tritons now have a 8-
7 record, and hope to retain their 
third SPOl into the following weeks 
leading up to the Regionals. 

A third-place ranking would help 
UCSD in the long run, because they 
would most likely face Redlands 
again, instead of top-team UC Santa 
Cruz. 

"We· like to be No. 3," Turner 
said. "It makes it easier for us 10 
advance to Nationals." 

The Tritons' next test wi ll be 
their toughest of the year. Next 
weekend, the La Jolla squad will 
travel to the home courts of the 
Division I University of San Diego 
Toreros, before their trip to the 
Western Individual Championships 
in two weeks.

tion and hard work of their athlete . 

"We get out here everyday, and work hard for 
three to four hours," Shepard said. 

For the first time in school hi story , both the 
Triton women ' s and men' s team are unde-
feated within their respective conferences. Cur-
rently , UCSD si ts atop Cal Poly Pomona, CSU-
Bakersfield, CSU-Los Angeles and UC River-
side in the standings. This is a predominately 
Division-II conference, and the Tritons have 
proven themselves capable of succesfully com-

peting at that level. 
"We' re becoming a 

real powerhouse," Stary 
said. 

At the national level, 
however, UCSD is re-
stricted to Divi ion-ill 
competition. 

Despite competing 
in a wide variety of 

events with athletes of diverse di sc iplines, the 
Triton have developed a winning team chemis-
try . 

"I think that we're really pulling together as a 
team this year. I think that's why we're doing so 
well ," Stary said. . 

To enhance team camaraderie, UCSD em-
ploys a system of mUltiple captains. Each of the 
variou event groups (throw , jumps, distance 
events and sprints) has its own captain. 

"It' s like an integrated thing to keep the dif-
ferent aspects of competition together. [For ex-
ample] there used to be a definite dichotomy 
between the printers and the distance runners," 
Stary commented. 

The Tritons next travel to the Pomona-
Pitzer Invitational on Friday, in hopes ofpost-
ing more NCAA qualifying marks. They then 
will compete in the California-Nevada State 
Championships and CCAA Conference Cham-
pionships .
