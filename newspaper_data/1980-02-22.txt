Court Holds

Case Decision 

SACRAMEN10 (AP) -
With a slap at the state Supreme 
Court, an appeals court has 
refused to reconsider its ruling 
striking down all UC preferential 
admissions policies for minoritie •. 

UC attorney Donald Reidhaar 
blasted the decision as "outright 
defiance of the law" and said 
yesterday he was preparing an 

a~a1 to the state Supreme Court. 
The 3rd District Court of 

Appeal denied the university's 
request . for a rehearing late 
Wednesday on the same 2-1 vote 
by whi"h it issued the original 
decision Jan. 21. 

The decision, if upheld on 
appeal, would go much further

UC Budget 
Gut ldea8·~~~-" 
Are 'Useless' 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
Sacramento Correlpondent 

State Finance Director Mary 
Ann Graves chastized UC 
President David Saxon this week 
for his "vague ... useless" answer to 
how to cut 30 percent from the UC 
budget. 

Graves invited Saxon to work 
out a more detailed alternative 
financial plan but warned, "In the 
interim your submission leaves me 
with no alternatives but to instruct 
my staff to prepare specific 
program reductions to the 
university budget." 

Graves said Saxon told her in a 
telephone conversation Wednes- . 
day night, he'd come back to her 
with specific cub.

Seventh Storln 
In Ten Days 
Closes CaDlpU.S 
Del Mar and Solana 
Beach Hardest Hit 

President Carter declared San Diego a dilUter 
area yesterday as the city made pi'eparationa for ita 
seventh .torm in ten days. Already, traffic has been 
di.rupted, schools dOled and power and telephone 
service has been disrupted throughout the county. 

Chancellor William McEl,roy ordered UCSD 
closed at 2 pm yesterday, and moat other schools 
also shut down as officials sent their employee. home 
before the next predicted stonn struck. 

Mission Valley sections of Interstate 8 were dosed 
last night, as were Pacific Coast Highway from 15th 
Street in Del Mar to Via De La Valle in Solana 
Beach, and Jimmy Durante and Coast Boulevards in 
Del Mar. 

The Pacific Coast Highway was scheduled to 
reopen this morning, Del Mar firefighters said, but 
only after efforts to reinforce the bridge over the San 
Dieguito River were completed and the safety of a 
Del Mar gas main under that river bed had been 
ensured •. 

The storms of the put week have hit the student 
cornmunitie. of Del Mar and Solana Beach harder 
than any place in the county. 

Thirty to forty homes on Coast Boulevard have 
been evacuated since Wednesday because of water 
2-3 feet high. Two hunc:lred horses and one cow were 
evacuated from the flooded racetrack, provi.ions 
were made at San Dieguito High School to handle up 
to 300 displaced refugees, and city officials thought 
the cost of the storms' damage might extend up to 
$200,000. 

Telephone service was also out or impaired for 
4,000 homes in Solana Beach, half the county total, 
because 10 phone cables under the flood-swollen San 
DieguitQ River were disturbed. 

Phone company workmen labored all night to 
remedy the problem and hoped to have service 
restored by this morning, phone company 
spokesman John Donner said. 

Firefighter. doubling as flood control officers had 
spent over 70 straight hours on duty as of last night.

Deportation of Gay 
De')8:yed by J dge 

LOS ANGELES - An 
immigration judge put off any 
deportation ruling yesterday 
pending appeal, in the case of 
an Australian homosexual 
who contends he should not be 
deported because he is 
married to a man. 

About 20 pickets marched 
outside the Federal Building 
during the hearing, carrying 
signa that read "Equal Rights

later received a letter from the 
Immigration and Naturaliza· 
tion Service saying, "You 
have failed to establillh that a 
bona fide marital relationship 
can exilt between faggots." 

The case wal then taken 
before US Diltrict Judge 
Irving HiU, who ruled that t6e

may be broadened to include 
the relationship between two 
homosexuals, but not yet.

Beach at about 11 pm Wednesday night, leveling 
trees and causing damage to several houses in the 
Via de la Valle area. The tornado knocked out power 
to 4,000 home in Del Mar. Most of them had 
electricity within 40 minutes, but some 50·100 
homes are still doing without, a spokesman for 
SDG&E said. 

At UCSD, most classes and activities were h~ted 
after McfJroy decided at noon to cancel classes and 
send administrators home at 2 pm. 

The chancellor's office heard over the radio 
yesterday morning that dasses were cancelled here, 
then heard reports from downtown San Diego that 
busineuel had been asked to send home their 
workers at 2 pm. . 

McElroy's office caucussed and decided to "be 
careful and cautious" and cloae the university . 

Campus damage has been light, but campus 
telecommunications system. were tied up most of 
yesterday, forcing most callers to wait up to a minute 
for a dial tone. 

Only the chancellor and telecommunications 
offices had direct service, but the problem eased as 
the campus emptied. 

Extracurricular activities Wer/' cancelled, including 
the opening night of the Woody Allen play Godin the 
John Muir theater. 

Recreation facilities and Ine Student Health Center 
were kept open on a limited, "skeleton" basis. 

Residence Halls remained open, and Third 
College placed its Re~ident Advisors on alert. 

All libraries closed at 2 pm, as did EDNA. The 
Coast Cruiser, the bus service between campus and 
north county, did not make its, usual thrice nightly 
Rlns. 

Other colleges experienced similar closures. 
The University of San Diego, located on top of a 

hill, closed and became a Red Cross disaster relief 
center serving low· lying areas around the university. 

San Diego State closed and became the center of a 
massive traffic jam caused by the exodus of its 
popul~tion .. Callers to the university were answered 
after 2 pm by a recording telling them to listen to 
radio or television to see if school w.ould open today. 

The community colleges and National University 
• also closed, as did most area high schools. Some of 
those schools, particularly those in desert and 
mountain areas, planned to remain closed today. 

The only other area of the . county seriously 
damaged is Mission Valley. 

The San Diego River, normally only a trickle, 
grew seven feet deep in ju.t four hours and floods 
spread throu.qh the hotel and .hopping district.

Fencing Berth at 
Stake Tom'orrow 

BY TIM LIOTTA 
S.-.. Editor 

This is the weekend for the 
UCSD fencing team. When 
they travel to Long Beach on 
SaJurday to cross swords with 
San Diego State and Cal Poly 
Pomona, a berth in the 
Western Regionals is at stake. 

Although hampered by 
injuries, the Tritons will send 
men's saber, epee and foil 
teams and a women 's foil team 
to compete in the dual meet, 
-each fencing for a spot in the 
Regionals . 

"I think the saber team has 
the best shot at the Rej1onals," 
said .enior saberist Greg Lee 
earlier this week, "but if each 
team has a good showing, all 
of us could go." 

The men's

consists of Lee, who is in his 
fourth season on the team, 
Andy Lee, a second year 
saberist and Alex Kercso , who 
only joined the squad this 
Quarter. 

"Alex has really come

along Quickly," commented 
Lee. 

The saber team made both 
SDSU and Cal Poly look Uke 
Swiss cheese earlier this 
season when they handed 
each a 9·0 fencing Ielson. But 
the Triton. won't have it so 
easy in this weekend's 
competition. 

Greg Lee is hampered by a 
sprained thumb, which could 
affect his control over the 
weapon. Andy ~ separated 
his shoulder earlier this month 
and is working hard trying to 
get back the precision he has 
shown in the past. 

The Women's foiltearn has 
already been assured of a 
bearth in the Regionals but 
they can use tomorrow's

lJCSI)'s athlete 01 the month far ........,., Freehmut Natalie Pierce 

'Qualified in 4 events 
BY JON GOETZ 

SIaIf Writ... 
Like most student., 

freshman Natalie Pierce is 
dreading next month'. final 
exams. 

Thi. quarter, however, she 
won't be able to keep her mind 
on the books. Pierce, the 
January Athlete of the Month, 
wiD be competing in the most 
important swim meet of her life 
on the weekend before finals, 
National Championships of 
the Association of IntercoUe· 
giate Athletics for Women at 
Allegheny College in 
Pennsylvania. 

Dann .aid .he could, as long 
a. all her turns were regulatiqn 
and she fini.hed under a 
certain time .tandard. 

Butterfly, unlike freestyle, 
requires t~tal ~y undulation, 
and IlIT ,"credIble output 01 
energy. The Iongelt anyone, 
including Olympians, swim in 
a butterfly race is 400 meters. 
Yet Natalie swam four times 
that length in that workout, 
getting out of another 1650. 

·"It was a challenge to do at 
the time," she said. "You ~et 
into a rhythm ... When you re 
going to workout every day 
you've got to find something 
fun to do with it." 

Weekend in Sports 

Early in ·the season she 
became the first UCSD 
swimmer ever to qualify for the 
AlA W championships. Since 
then three of her teammates 
have joined her in qualifying, 
but only Natalie hall made the 
national time in five individual 
events. She first qualified in the 
200 free, then coach Diana 
Dann pulled her out of that 
event and put her in other 
.wims. She qualifjed for the 
1000 free.tyle the first time 
.he ever swam the event. 
Since then she has also made 
the time standard. in the 200 
and 400 individual medleys, 
and the 200 free. 

Some swimmers regard her 
as a "showoff", and she is 
quite outspoken, but antics like 
that come naturally to Pierce 
after 1 0 years of competitive 
.wimming. 

"I've done it 80 long, it's just 
~ natural," she says. "I go to 
one workout, then I go to 
achool, then I go to another 
workout, then I go to sleep."

"Kathy keeps the whole

Lee, "she almost runs the

Now .he has to choose 
which events to .wim, because 
it would be impractical to 
attempt too many, 001 to 
mention phy.ically draining. 
AI the events she has to 
choose from are arduous, but 
then Pierce is known as a 
heavyweight athlete. 

In a workout at the end of 
last year she iDustrated her 
hardiness. She was assigned to 
.wim two 1650 yard freestyle 
swims. Pierce asked her coach 
if she could lwim just one 
1650 of bUHerfJ)' and .kip the 
other 1650. Coach Diana 

She's developed a whole 
ran8~ of things to do while 
working out. 

"I do my homework in my 
head. When I'm bored with 
phy.ics I sing a lOng. That'. 
how I get my rhythm," she 
say •. "Of course you've also 
got to think about swimming." 

All the workout., all the 
meets eventually lead into the' 
ultimate event for .wimmer. 
- nationals. "Since 
November I've been waiting 
for this meet," she says. Pierce 
hal been to Hawaii and 
Washington to swim meets, 
been to Texas to .wim in a 
relay at the AAU Junior 
National., but this is the first 
time .he wiD be swimming 
individual events at a national 
championship.

highlight of the program is 
surely the classic "Duck

Overall, though, the joy of 
seeing one unforgettable 
cartoon after another on the

cartoon is introduced by Bugs

BY RICK. GREENE 
Recently asked the 

manager of a movie theatre 
why he doesn't program 
cartoons before the feature 
anymore. He logically replied 
that the running of a cartoon 
detracts from valuable 
rdreshment stand time. And 
since the snack bar, and not 
the' box office, is where the 
modem theatre really rakes in 
the profits, the saga of the 
theatrical cartoon sems to 
have died a quiet death. 

But now, when we least 

expected it, "The Bugs 
Bunny-Roadrunner Movie" 
come. roaring into town in 
gorgeous, full.creen, dazzling 
technicolor! A 80rt of 
unofficial sequel to 1975's 
successful compilation feature 
"Bugs Bunny . Superstar," 
"The Bugs Bunny.Road.

of the art of animation, the

and Merrie Melodies writers, 
the genius of director Chuck 
Jones and the many voices of 
Mel Blanc.

Farrah Fawcett), two

Saturn and make love as often

"Demigod" series and his 
name is Hector. 

The makers of "Saturn 3," 
yet another new science fiction 
thriller, knew they couldn't 
equal the wonderful effects in 
"Star Wars," recreate the 
gripping tension in "Alien" or 
compete with the intel~gent

Robot in 'Saturn 3' 
The producers wisely 

decided to concentrate on the 
robot and not on f arrah 
F awcelt in the newspaper and 
television advertillementll, 
since Farrah ill like the kill of 
death 10 a motion picture. Her 
two evious features, 

"Somebody Killed Her 
Husband" and "Suntan," were 
.c:omp1ete Dopa. And here, in 
her third try, she strikes out. 
She appears throughout the 
film in slit down the middle and 
low cut IIhirts, tight leather 
pants, skimpy night gowns 
and Dowing white dreues. But 
this exploitation is expected, 
and there is no need to dwell on 
Farrah's enormous lack of 
discernible talent. She is just 
another pretty face, aNl.this is 
a generation of filmm~ers 
who seem to have forsaken 
talent for beauty an«l box 
office. 

The special effects in 
"Satwn 3" are a throwback to 
those terrible Sf quickies of 
the 19SOs-. The stars and 
planets are obvious paintingl 
and the miniatures of the space 
station on Saturn look like 
somebody spilled something. 
The humans in this lOrry 
future all have square tatooll 
on their faces called "Ieanl," 
and enjoy big pillll c;alled 
"blues."

with a marvelous wit. 

Rumpole is deftly played by 
Leo McKern; you mil{ht 
remember him as the 

hilariously persistent high 
priest in Help!. McKern plays 
for the comedy but he never

character. Peggy Thrope-

Under the series title 
Mystery, PBS is presenting a 
potpourri of movies and multi-
part drama~ in the mystery 
genre. Mystery encompasses 
a variety of shows ranging 
from farce to courtroom 
drama to gothic romance. The 
quality varies from show to 
show, but for the next three 
w~ks viewers will be treated 
to the delightful Horace 
Rumpole, a London barrister.

around the eccentric Rumpole.

appears like an English 
incarnation of W.C.F~lds. 
But his burly, comical exterior 
masks a shrewd legal mind 
and a rich character. He is a 
sharply drawn character who 
holds no illusions about his 
field (in fact, he compares 
lawyers to tarts: "they both are

State Sends UC Budget Back to Saxon 
Continued from page I 

In the $290 million Jarvia II 
reductiGna Saxon waa asked to 
preaent to the Governor, he 
proteated vehemently that the 
university should not be 
lUb;ect to 30 percent "worst 
cue" cuts and specified only 
that the university would make 
$96 million in program cuts 
and rai.e $194 million 
through tuition. 

"I am quite capable of 
calculating. the percentage 
which would be necellary if aD 
budgets were reduced 

proportionally to offset the 
expected revenue loll and 
know this is lell than 30 
percent," Graves wrote to 
Saxon. "However, it is not my 
intent to propose a 
proportionate reduction." 

The university's ability to 
raise funds have made it more 
vulnerable than other 
departments, such as the 
Department of Health's 
mental hospitals, which 
cannot make even the smallest 
reduction without risks of 
losing their accreditation.

Yesterday, UC Vice 
President Tom Jenkins, who is 
responsible for the UC budget, 
conceded, "Over the next two 
weeks, we are' going to spell 
out in more general terms what 
we meant by those cuts." 

Jenkins reiterated , 
however, that the university 
cannot come up with a "hit 
list" because of the potential 
deteriorating effect on the 
university, the faculty and the 
students. 

"It would be foolhardy to 
get down to naming specific

On the other hand, Nina 
Lahmann is not quite as 
successful in the role of 
Romaine. She does not 
completely capture the 
mystery or ingenuity behind 
her character. Lahmann, 
though, does convey an 
appropriate ambivalence in 
her character. She also knows 
how to make a striking 
entrance. 

Among the other perform. 
ers, Darrel Wilson gives a 
solid performance as Sir 
Robarts; Brian Salmon is 
sharp as the prosecutor; and 
Lani Murray turns in a gem of 
a performance as the 
forthright housekeeper Janet 
Mackenzie. 

As staged by the Old Globe, 
Witness for the Prosecution 
moves smoothly and elegantly 
towards its surprise ending. 
The play, although a bit long, 
should especially please 
aficionados of Christie. 
Witness for the Prosecution is 
being presented by the Old 
Globe at the California 
Theatre through March 9.

programs. What we can't say 
is 'X' school should be shut 
down without throwing faculty 
and students in a panic. We 
have a complex set of 
programs, nine campuses, an 
impact differential for each of 
those campuses and a 
com p1icated managerial 
setup. It would be self· 
destructive," Jenkins said. 

Jenkins also indicated the 
university was worried about 
the credibility problem created 
by selecting programs to be 
cut under the "worst case"

minority admissions prog-
grams. 

In ordering white student 
Allan Bakke admitted to the 
UC Davis medical school, the 
US Supreme Court ruled that 
racial quotas were illegal 
without proof of past 
discrimination. But it also 
indicated that race may be 
considered in admissions to 
promote the goal of a diverse 
student body. 

In the case of Glen 
DeRonde , another white 
student who sought admission 
to the UC !)avis law school, 
the appeals court ruled that 
race may not be considered in 
admissions even without 
quotas. 

The court did not say 
De Ronde should have been 
admitted in 1975. 

But the appeals court struck 
down a Davis program that 
awarded minority. applicants 
"points" tlu!t could help offset 
lower grades and test scores. 
Reidhaar said the ruling 
appeared to c,?ver all public 
colleges. 

scenano. "We fell even under 
those circumstances 30 
percent is too high," he said. 

Jenkins predicted Jarvis II 
would probably not entail any 
more than a 10 percent overall 
reduction should it pass on 
June 3. 

According to Chuck Gocke, 
assistant director of finance , 
the Department of Finance 
was particularly concerned 
with Saxon's general 
statement regarding tuition. 
No one really knows what the ' 
effects might be," Go<;ke said. 

Collective 
Coniinued from page I 
managing cooperatives like 
the Collective. 

The Student Center Board 
gets "a hell of a lot more done 
than the AS," and the AS is 
afraid it is becoming "too 
autonomous," according to 
Kessler. 

Kessler was particularly 
critical of AS President Carlos 
Montalvo, who he said had 
run for office on a platform of 
saving the Coffee Hut but was 
now trying to keep from 
student control. 

Montalvo responded by 
accusing Kessler of trying to 
play the AS off of the Student 
Center Board, "All the AS is 
saying is that if you're going to 
ask the Council for money, we 
ought to know where it's 
going," he said. 

He noted that the Collective 
is already under the wntrol of 
the Student Center Board, 
which conducts a monthly 
review of the Collective's 
budget. The Student Center 
Board also controls space 
allocation in the Hut.
