UCSD united for a day of revelry on May 15, when 
thousands of students, alumni and assorted concertgo-
ers poured onto campus for the 27th annual Sun God 
Festival.

At 7 a.m. on the morning of the event, students 
began lining up at the Ridge Walk tennis courts to claim 
their festival wristbands, eventually forming a line that 
wound past Peterson Hall and Geisel Library. At one 
point, it stretched as far as Earl Warren College Mall. 

A new wristband retrieval system was implemented 
this year in an effort to speed up the distribution pro-
cess. However, some festivalgoers waited in line for up 
to four hours while volunteers distributed wristbands at 
24 booths.

Five San Diego residents were 
arrested last week for the murder 
13 years ago of UCSD School of 
Medicine professor David F. Hessler, 
then 30. Cold-case crime investiga-
tors used an expanded fingerprint 
database to track down the suspects.

Fingerprints collected at the 
crime scene on Nov. 14, 1995, were 
reexamined in February 2008, 
resulting in the identification and 
arrest of Buzie Gene Wiemer, 34. 

Over the next 15 months, detec-
tives from the cold-case homicide 
team and investigators from the 
District Attorney’s Office gathered 
more information about the case, 
which led them to identify four 
additional suspects.

“Once we had a potential identi-
fication of the first subject, we began 
working vigorously to find the other 
suspects,” Lt. Terry McManus of the 
San Diego Police Department homi-
cide unit said.

The other four suspects — Edul 
Jinnah Azeez, 34; Khoi Leron 
Bruster, 32; Alvin Mamangun 
Timbol, 32; and an unnamed 
30-year-old man — are all San 
Diego residents. Investigators are 
withholding the name of the fifth 
suspect because he was a juvenile at 
the time of the fatal shooting. 

Police said Timbol, 19 at the time 
of the murder, is the man who alleg-
edly shot and killed Hessler.

All of the men surrendered 
peacefully when arrested last week, 
authorities said.

At their arraignment Wednesday, 
the four identified suspects pleaded 
“not guilty,” and are currently being 
held in custody in lieu of $1 mil-
lion bail. 

In 1995, Hessler walked out-
side of the University City home he 
shared with his fiancee at approxi-
mately 2 a.m., after being awakened 
by noises coming from the front 
yard. He confronted thieves break-
ing into his SUV and was shot in 
the chest.

When police arrived at his 
Huggins Street home in response 
to neighborhood reports of gunfire, 
Hessler was lying on the ground. He 
was pronounced dead at the scene. 

According to police, the theives 
were after the expensive computer 
equipment stored in Hessler’s truck, 

Suspects plead ‘not 
guilty’ at arraignment, 
remain in custody after 
court orders $1 million 
bail.

SACRAMENTO BEE/MCT
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger released two versions of his lastest budget revision on May 11 — over a 
week before tomorrow’s special election — to demonstrate the severity of the state’s financial situation. 

By Joyce Yeh 
Staff Writer

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
predicted another cut of at least 
$765 million to the University of 
California at a budget-revision 
conference last Thursday. The 
announcement arrived just three 
months after the state Legislature 
approved a $115 million funding cut 
to the university.

The budget revisions come 
in response to a predicted bud-
get shortfall of $15.4 billion, which 
Schwarzenegger said led him to pro-
pose further funding cuts and short-
term borrowing. 

Under the governor’s proposed 
changes, the UC and California 
State University systems would face 
a total of $1.1 billion in funding 
cuts. The UC system would lose 
$510 million in the current 2008-09

to be used for a presentation Hessler 
was giving the following day at the 
San Diego Convention Center.

The professor and computer-
programming analyst worked at the 
UCSD School of Medicine for six 
years before his death.

San Diego police had developed 
no leads on the case until review-
ing the evidence last year, which 
pointed to their first suspect in the 
killing.

“There has never been anything 
to indicate that the suspects had any 
personal connection to the profes-

sor,” McManus said.
McManus declined to discuss 

any specific evidence, due to the 
possibility of a future trial for the 
five men.

fiscal year and $255 million in 2009-
10 — a total of $765 million in cuts. 

The shortfall would be eased 
slightly with $640 million in federal 
stimulus money, but the university 
will still be left with a net reduction 
of $125 million from the current 
budget.

Schwarzenegger warned that the 
university will face an additional 
$50 million cut in state funding and 
a $31 million cut from academic-
preparation programs in 2009-10 if 
Propositions 1A-1F — which would 
supply the state with $5.9 billion 
in general-revenue funds — fail to 
pass in California’s special election 
on Tuesday.

According to UC President 
Mark G. Yudof, if these cuts were 
implemented, the university would 
be forced to increase student fees 
and class sizes, while subsequently 
decreasing enrollment, the availabil-
ity of campus services and academic 
program offerings. 

In addition, university employ-
ees would face pay reductions and 
furloughs. 

“Additional budget cuts of this 
magnitude would have a devastating 
effect on the students, the faculty 
and the staff of the University of 
California, and ultimately, on the 
service we provide to the state,” 
Yudof said. “The severe reductions 
envisioned in these scenarios, espe-

cially if the ballot measures fail, 
threaten a dramatic change in the 
quality and accessibility of the uni-
versity.”

He added that if the state 
Legislature continues to cut from 
higher education, it will eventually 
lead to a weaker workforce.

“I am concerned that this new 
round of cuts for the state’s entire 
public education system comes 
at a time when the Public Policy 
Institute of California has warned 
us that the state’s workforce will face 
a shortage of nearly one million col-
lege graduates by 2025, unless state 
leaders implement policy changes to 
enroll and graduate more students,” 
Yudof said. “The consequences of 

these budget proposals for academic 
preparation and student accessibil-
ity are daunting.”

Schwarzenegger acknowledged 
the severity of the cuts, but said they 
were necessary at this time to keep 
the state’s deficit from worsening.

“To solve our immediate cash 
crisis, we simply cannot avoid 
deep and painful cuts in spend-
ing,” Schwarzenegger said. “Some of 
these solutions are things I would 
never have considered in the past, 
but unfortunately, our state could 
be in a worst-case scenario if the 
propositions fail.”

Schwarzenegger said he 
announced his budget revisions 
over a week before the election to 
show California residents the sever-
ity of the state’s current fiscal situ-
ation and to urge voters to pass all 
six measures.

“People need to know how this 
election will affect them,” he said. “I 
think this is what the upcoming elec-
tion on May 19 is all about. It’s about 
California’s future and California’s 
legacy, so this is the question about 
this election: whether we continue 
to tumble down the path of finan-
cial ruin and despair or whether we 
stand up and dust ourselves off and 
start the slow but steady march back 
towards prosperity.”

sophomore Heather Geisler said. “It 
was really crowded and unorganized 
… Everyone was cutting in line.”

According to festival coordina-
tors Alex Bramwell and Jeanette 
Ordonez, the initial rush was due to a 
fear among students that wristbands 
would run out quickly. This concern 
was aggravated by the official Sun 
God Web site, which advised stu-
dents to arrive early due event limited 
capacity of RIMAC Field. 

According to Associate Vice 
President of Concerts and Events 
Garrett Berg, there were just under 
1,000 wristbands left unclaimed by 
the end of the night. 

“Everyone panicked and got 
there early,” Bramwell said. “People 
were just nervous about us run-
ning out of wristbands when they 
really didn’t need to be. So people 
that showed up at 9 a.m. ended up 
waiting two or three hours, whereas 
if they’d showed up at 1 p.m. they 
would have gotten the same wrist-
band and gotten to go right up to the 
front of the line.”  

The line subsided by noon, at 
which point students were able to 
retrieve their wristbands in a matter 
of minutes. Bramwell said that the 
same distribution system could be 
used again next year, provided that 
festival organizers better inform stu-
dents of the abundance of wristbands.

 “When you have 18,000 people 
showing up all at once there’s only 
so much you can do,” he said. “If it 
was properly messaged to students 
that they really didn’t have anything 
to worry about, then I think that this 
system would work fine, so that peo-
ple would show up throughout the 
day when they had free time instead 
of all showing up at 9 a.m.”

Daytime attractions on RIMAC 
Field included a collection of student 
films screened by campus venue the 
Loft, circus and dance performances 
under the centrally located midway 
tent and a set by folk-rocker Iron & 
Wine. 

After dark, audiences flocked to 
performances by mashup artist Girl 
Talk — whose hour-long set packed 
the dance tent to near capacity — and 
rock-rap trio N.E.R.D.

“Even if we had made no changes 
to the festival format, our lineup this 
year was just so much more of what 
students were looking for,” Berg said. 
“The full atmosphere of the event this 
year was worlds better.”

The day’s events weren’t limited to 
RIMAC Field. At the Student Center, 
KSDT hosted an alternative music 
festival called Shun God, and student 
satire newspaper the Koala set up 
its annual Slip ’N Slide on Sun God 
Lawn.

Nearly 24 years ago, California voters approved the 
creation of a state 
lottery designed 
to provide fund-
ing for public 
education while 
offering the lure 
of lucrative payout 
prizes to gamblers. 

Now, in a bid to 
stabilize the ailing state 
economy and close a 
sizeable budget deficit, 
the Legislature has proposed sig-
nificant revisions to this lottery 
system. And by the looks of it, they 
might just do the trick.

Under Proposition 1C, the lot-
tery would undergo a makeover 
aimed at increasing its appeal and 
drawing in new players. In its cur-
rent form, the lottery simply isn’t as 
popular as it has been in the past, 
and revenue has fallen as a result. 

With 1C, however, payouts 
would be increased and market-
ing efforts would be revitalized, 
hopefully rejuvenating profits and 
pumping more funding back into 
the state’s coffers. 

Which is exactly where it would 
go. While current lottery regula-
tions require that 34 percent of all 
revenue be directed toward fund-
ing public education, 1C would lift 
this requirement and the money 
would go directly into the state 
general fund.  

The benefit is that while fund-
ing for education would be retained 
— and likely even increased if lot-
tery revenue does indeed go up 
— the state would gain the ability 
to borrow up to $5 billion against 
future lottery profits. 

It might look like just another 
quick fix borrowing solution, and 
1C will surely signal future costs 
when it comes time to pay back 
the bonds that follow this measure, 
but it’s hard to argue with any plan 
that translates to more money now, 
when California needs it most. 

Though it’d be nice to think that our state legislators had some smidgen of foresight, our current $41.6 bil-
lion state deficit is proof that absolutely no 
one was ready for even the slightest bump 
in the fiscal road, let alone a serious reces-
sion.

Perhaps that’s why Proposition 1A is 
nicknamed the “rainy day” fund — state 
officials are finally taking a tip from their 
mothers and trying to pocket some cash for 
the long run.

Unfortunately, the savings tactic isn’t as 
simple when you’re grabbing at taxpayers’ 
wallets. If passed, Proposition 1A would 
extend recently increased sales, income 
and vehicle taxes for up to two additional 
years — resulting in a tax hike of some $16 
billion.

Of course, raising taxes isn’t the point of 
the proposition. Its main purpose would be 
to save money in case of state catastrophes 
(say, like the one we’re in right now) by 
putting aside above-average state revenue, 
enforcing more rigid restrictions on how to 
spend that money and giving the governor 
more power to regulate state spending.

Though Proposition 1A is far too little 
of an effort this late in the game, and a 
messy way to clean up our serious state 
economic crisis, the measure is still our 
best bet in lessening the burn of budget cuts 
and giving our future economy a backbone.

Beginning in 2010-11 fiscal year, any 
extra revenue in the fund would be given 
to K-12 schools and community colleges 
to make up for unpaid funds promised to 

these institutions through Proposition 98.
After that, money would go straight to 

our rainy-day bucket until it reaches about 
12.5 percent of the general state fund.

If and when we reach that goal, we’d use 
any excess cash to pay off budgetary debt. 

That’s not to say there aren’t plenty of 
downsides to Proposition 1A.

Taxing California citizens who are 
already struggling to pay the bills won’t help 
bolster our economy and giving our gover-
nor more limitational power on spending 
could mean many state operational budgets 
will be even more severely cut. 

But California is at its breaking point. 
If 1A isn’t passed, it won’t be long until the 
state budget will collapse on itself. We aren’t 
given the luxury of bankruptcy protection 
and we sure as hell don’t want to deal with 
creditor lawsuits, so it’s probably about 
time we start moving forward with a plan 
— however flawed it might be.

Although Proposition 1B is clearly the package’s black sheep — the only initia-
tive that gives nothing but takes 
a lot — it appropriately situates 
funding for K-12 education and 
community colleges as a top state 
priority. The measure would take 
from 1A-secured funds to recover 
about $9.3 billion owed to schools 
under 1988’s Proposition 98. This 
is money that education has been 
shorted in recent years because of 
budgetary strain. 

While 1B has flaws — perhaps 
most notably that it excludes four-
year universities — increasing edu-
cation funding represents the kind 
of long-term investment California 
needs. Right now the state’s pub-
lic school system is deteriorating, 
and with it a generation of young 
citizens. One out of every eight 
children in America is educated in 
California, but a Stanford University 
report found that the state ranks 
seventh lowest nationally in math-
ematics, third lowest in reading 
and second lowest in science. And 
California’s plagued with high drop-
out rates; Los Angeles, for exam-
ple has a 56 percent dropout rate, 
according to an April 22 report from 
the Editorial Projects in Education 
Research Center. 

This translates to increased 
unemployment, crime, incarcera-
tion and health-care costs for the 
state. Meanwhile, high-school grad-
uates contribute to state and federal 

taxes at about twice the rate of drop-
outs, according to a 2006 National 
Public Radio report. 

A well-educated and informed 
citizenry will ameliorate (if not alto-
gether correct) many of the state’s 
most costly problems. By giving our 
schools the support they need, vot-
ers and legislators are making a wise 
investment in the state’s future.

YES ON PROPOSITION 1Cx

This initiative prioritizes educa-
tion, taking a thoughtful approach 
to the state’s funding future.

WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE YES

Restores Proposition 98-level school 
funding by pulling $9.3 billion 
from 1A’s “rainy day” fund.

WHAT 1B WILL DO
The plan will bring in significant 
revenue without generating any 
new taxes.

WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE YES

Restructures the state lottery, 
allowing the Legislature to borrow 
against future lottery profits.

WHAT 1C WILL DO

YES ON PROPOSITION 1Bx

On Tuesday, Californians will brave the ballot and vote in yet another special election. This time around it’s all about money, and in the face of a fiscal mess our legislators have shed their differences behind closed doors and forged a disappointing compromise, popping out 
six propositions that don’t give anyone what they really want. 

But unsatisfying results are typical of ballot-box budgeting: Californians are always rallying for 
program funding only to realize they must vote the same cash into another source a few years later. 

Nevertheless, our state is in a serious financial crisis. If Propositions 1A-1E fail, education 
funding will be cut by an additional $2.3 billion, leaving the University of California with a $531 
million hole to fill in the 2009-10 academic year. UC President Mark G. Yudof has already hinted 
at the “unpleasant” consequences, such as raising student fees, cutting academic programs and 
limiting student services.

So, this board reluctantly endorses propositions 1A-1F.
That’s not to say California should stop at these propositions. Legalizing marijuana, for 

instance, would earn us tons of cash and help empty our costly, crowded prisons. But until the 
state loosens up a little, we’ll just have to deal with higher taxes and cuts to essential programs.

YES ON PROPOSITION 1Dx

It’s hard to think of anyone more deserving of an extra 50-cent donation — fueled by your 
nicotine fix — than underprivi-
leged under-five-year-olds. That’s 
why, 10 years ago, voters couldn’t 
grumble too loudly when asked to 
pass the Children and Families First 
Act, which would promote “First 5” 
health-care and smoking-prevention 
programs by bumping the cigarette 
tax up two precious quarters.

Though the proposition passed 
by a mere 0.5 percent margin, its 
spare change has gone to a much 
better place than the next pack. “First 
5” overcame a rocky start plagued 
with controversial campaigns, and 
now lends a much-needed crutch to 
families without the resources to help 
their children make it through the 
crucial early years.

Nothing could appear more heart-
less than redirecting $268 million a 
year for five years from an organiza-
tion dedicated to children’s health 
to the state’s vaguely cold “general 
fund,” for the suits to divvy up as they 
please. However, a decade of more 

fruitful days allowed for $2.5 billion 
of unspent “First 5” dough to build up 
in case of emergency — and I think 
we can agree this is an emergency. 
If Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
propositions don’t pass, we’re looking 
at the gutting of much more basic 
children’s health programs than the 
luxurious-by-comparison services 
enacted 10 years ago by the Children 
and Families First Act. No one wants 
to take steps backward after coming 
so far, but until the economy starts 
its engines again, it’s progressive add-
ons like the admirable “First 5” pro-
gram who unfortunately have to take 
one for the team.

Without 1D, several basic California 
programs vital to children’s health and 
well-being would be cut.

WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE YES

Redirects 50-cent tobacco tax from 
“First 5” initiative to state-run health 
programs for next five years.

WHAT 1D WILL DO

YES ON PROPOSITION 1Fx
This one’s a no-brainer: Vote yes on Proposition 1F to block pay raises for elected 
officials during years when the 
state runs a deficit. 

Unfortunately, as is the case 
with much of this package, vot-
ers are left supporting the mea-
sure not because it’s effective, 
but because it’s clear we’ve got to 
do something and there are no 
other options on the table. At first 
glance Proposition 1F appears to 
be a stern reality check for our 
elected officials, reminding them 
of their tremendous responsibil-
ity to balance the state’s budget, 
while simultaneously curtailing 
salary costs in deficit years. Upon 
closer inspection, 1F is more sym-

bolic than substantive — this year 
the change would save a mere 
$420,000, and there are few weaker 
threats than, “Do your job or that 
six-figure salary won’t be raised 
next year!” 

It’s true that every little bit 
counts (and this is surely the lit-
tlest) but it’d be nice to see an 

incentive with some teeth, like the 
proposal to dock legislators’ pay 
for every day after the legal dead-
line that passes without a budget. 
This time it’s all gums in the name 
of compromise.

Every bit counts when it comes to 
balancing the budget and keeping 
legislators accountable.

WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE YES

Prohibits pay raises for elected offi-
cials when California faces a budget 
deficit.

WHAT 1F WILL DO

YES ON PROPOSITION 1Ex
Only thing worse than steal-ing money from small sick children is stealing money 
from adults without the mental 
capacity to have any sort of say in the 
matter. The Mental Health Services 
Act, passed just five years ago by 53.8 
percent of Californians, attempted to 
counteract a generation of rampant 
homelessness by shaving 1 percent 
off all salaries over $1 million and 
channeling the money toward men-
tal-health programs and facilities.

Perfect — pull the money for 
those who can’t get a job from the 
back pockets of those with too much 
job to keep track of. That’s why 1E 
is trickier than 1D — paying a ciga-
rette tax is debatably avoidable (i.e., 
don’t smoke), but a millionaire tax 
is more of a mandatory gift from the 
wealthy, and to change the recipient 
midstream should rightly disgruntle 
those tasked with giving it.

In this case, though, the change 
would only take two years and about 
$460 million, and would go toward 
the equally crucial — not to mention 

federally mandated — Medi-Cal pro-
gram. Plus, like 1D, 1E can fall back 
on the $2.5 billion in reserves already 
raised for mental-health services by 
the short run of the millionaire tax 
so far. There’s nothing to do but 
cringe, check another ‘Yes’ and cross 
our fingers this doesn’t become a 
permanent fixture and force a whole 
new wave of mentally impaired 
Americans out on the center divide.

The money is desperately needed, 
and the two-year time frame for 
redistribution is fair.

WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE YES

Redirects money to temporarily sup-
port Medi-Cal programs at risk of 
receiving funding cuts.

WHAT 1E WILL DO

Dear Editor,
I don’t know about anyone else, but 

I was not planning on spending the 
first four hours of Sun God waiting in 
line for a wristband. By the time I actu-
ally got a wristband, half of the day had 
gone by and the concert had already 
started. I feel bad for whoever was 
performing because I’m sure that the 

audience they anticipated was M.I.A.
If they wanted to just hand out the 

wristbands on the day of, there are 
a number of more efficient ways to 
achieve the same goal. Have more line 
security and enforcement. For the first 
three hours of handing out wristbands, 
there was a free-for-all mentality. 
Those too lazy to wait in line simply 
cut in the beginning where everyone 
was clumped together. As far as I know, 
the Economics Building was a nice 
shortcut to the front of the line. For 
those honest people who endured the 
waiting, this was the major reason for a 
four-hour wait. Things they could have 
done better: more line enforcement. 
Handing out all of the wristbands in 
one place in one day, also a dumb idea. 
Considering the fact that 20,000 peo-
ple were expected to attend Sun God 
at various times during the day, did 
anyone really think handing out 20,000 
wristbands would be smooth sailing? 
I think the general public could agree 
that this seems like a disaster. Another 
thing they could have done better: set 
up multiple locations throughout the 
school, possibly one at each college. 
This way the lines would not block 
walkways and the crowds could be 
regulated, as they would be spread out.

Sun God 2009 started out as a flop. 
This new system took away from the 
hardworking students and overshad-
owed good performances and the kick-
ass concert that ensued later in the day.

East, that ribbon of market stands 
skirting Library Walk on Tuesdays 

puts up stiff competition. After all, they pro-
vide the only on-campus source of locally 
grown groceries and organic produce.

Now a group of students is actually one-
upping local growers with plans to foster an 
urban farm on the UCSD campus by the end 
of the year.

Amid accelerating sustainable devel-
opment across the U.S., the Sustainable 
Food Project’s urban-farm proposal is only 
waiting on funds before it begins break-
ing ground. After receiving approval for an 
8,800-square-foot patch of Pepper Canyon, 
members of the Food Project spearhead-
ing the initiative are hoping the university 
embraces their efforts fiscally as well. 

On May 27, the urban-farm proposal 
will be heard by an assembly of vice chancel-
lors who will decide whether or not the uni-
versity should allocate funds. As it stands, a 
swelling congress of students, faculty, orga-
nizations and administrators have already 
endorsed the campaign — including John 
Muir College Provost Susan Smith, Director 

of the Wellness Center Dr. Jerry Phelps and 
Vice Chancellor of Student Life Penny Rue.

“[The university has] had attempts on 
campus, but they’re mainly community or 
co-operative,” the project’s community advi-
sor and 2007 graduate Matt Finkelstein said. 
“What our vision incorporates is an educa-
tional center and opportunities for research.” 

The farm, a student-led proposal tai-
lored to the university’s academic pursuits, 
is answering a national call for dramatic 
change. Although UCSD has already made 
considerable green strides, project co-found-
er and Muir College senior Jack Buchanan 
said an urban farm would enhance cur-
riculum by allowing students to take an 
active role in the university’s sustainable 
development.

With a viable plan already in place 
at other schools such as San Diego City 
College, the urban farm is looking to simi-
larly utilize a fresh set of seasonal crops and 
farm managers every year while challenging 
the characterization of on-campus sustain-
ability.

Urban farming has been successfully 
implemented in lawns across SDCC, UC 
Santa Cruz and Yale. Julia Dashe, co-man-

ager of the San Diego City College “Seeds 
at City” farm, spoke at a UCSD freshman 
seminar this quarter addressing the positive 
impact of permaculture — or the designing 
of self-sufficient human settlements — and 
interactive gardening.

“Systematic problems need systematic 
solutions, because what we’re doing to our 
environment is destroying its equilibrium,” 
Dashe said. 

Though the SDCC’s farm only took 
root last June — the first-ever urban farm 
program in San Diego County — it has 
already upgraded from cover crops (plants 
that replenish their own soil with nitrogen) 
to an orchard of apples, figs, pomegranates, 
fruiting vines and vegetables. The garden 
has been so productive that its organizers 
are already looking into establishing a sec-
ond site.

Instructors and farm managers from 
SDCC have been helping the Sustainable 
Food Project plan for Pepper Canyon’s 
pending blossom.

on’t let Daniel Nguyen’s, shoulder-length nest of hair 
fool you. Or David Barclay’s epic bramble of a beard, 
cultivated while — literally — out at sea. Or even 
Andrew Rubens’s waterfall of bangs. Nguyen, a core 

member of the Food Co-op, wants you to know: “We’re not a 
bunch of dirty hippies.”

While UCSD’s cooperatives are often bundled into one big 
box of “dirty hippie” stereotype — dreads, granola, Marx and 
copious amounts of weed — Groundwork Books, the General 
Store, the Food Co-op and Che Cafe have a lot to offer. They’re 
student-run, nonhierarchical and nonprofit, doubling as stu-
dent orgs and businesses.

The Food Co-op sells fresh, natural foods, much of it made 
in-house. Groundwork shelves a respectable collection of 
radical and alternative texts you most often won’t find at the 
UCSD Bookstore, and for a reasonable price. More than just 
a stock of low-cost goods and snacks (and the only place on 
campus to buy cigarettes), the General Store also rents DVDs 
for a couple bucks and has an old-school video-game station. 
Che Cafe puts on cheap, all-ages shows and makes vegan food 
that — according to Barclay, a member who isn’t vegan — is 
actually really good.

According to Rubens, a G-Store member, the co-ops pro-
vide “what UCSD as a whole lacks: community.” 

But, over the roughly 35 years the co-ops have been in 
existence, these safe havens have come dangerously close to 
collapse. In fact, the co-ops’ history is fit for the big screen: 
There’s action, adventure, unrequited love, class warfare, bur-
glary, theft, riot police, restraining orders, terrorism and, of 
course, organic produce.

Groundwork was the first cooperative on campus, estab-
lished in 1974. Charles Senger, a septuagenarian UCSD alum-
nus, is a current member of the Groundwork Books collective 
but has been involved with the co-op since its inception. He 
remembers the years preceding Groundwork’s official estab-
lishment, when its founders began selling radical books from 
a small cart during political demonstrations. Amid growing 
popularity, Senger said Groundwork Books moved into a 
“closet” before finally being granted its own space.

The General Store arrived soon after in 1977 (officially 
established in 1980) when, as written in the G-Store’s blog, a 
group of students came together “to order jeans at a discounted 
price.” From these humble beginnings, the co-op eventually 
garnered support and its own space on campus.

Then came the Food Co-op, in 1978. A picture of its 
founder, Tim Sankary, is on display in the store above the bagel 
cutter. According to the portrait and Food Co-op lore, Sankary 
“started selling apples and oranges for 10 cents from a fruit cart 
in the quad” in 1974, while attempting to land a date. As legend 
has it, despite his efforts expertly slinging produce from his 

bicycle, he didn’t get the girl.
Che Cafe was the last of the co-ops to be established, in 

1980. Originally opened as a restaurant for the Food Co-op to 
sell its fare, it quickly grew into a hybrid cafe and events center.

Barclay — a graduate student at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography — said the Che is a legend. In fact, he first 
heard of it while attending high school in Canada. Since its 
inception, it has spawned similar all-ages, collectively run DIY 
venues like the Smell in Los Angeles, which openly acknowl-
edges Che Cafe’s influence. According to Barclay, it continues 
to host “legends” in the independent music scene, and is open 
to pretty much anyone willing to do the work involved in 
organizing an event. 

“If you can imagine it,” Barclay said, “it can happen at the 
Che.”

The co-ops have been central in initiating on-campus 
social action, leading rallies, sit-ins and demonstrations —  
including a week-long protest against apartheid in the early 
’80s — in addition to fighting for their own existence.

Nearly two decades ago, what the ’92-era Guardian called 
a “war” broke out between the co-ops and the administration. 
On November 18, 1991, in a memo heard ’round the campus, 
University Centers Director Jim Carruthers accused the co-ops 
of “illicit financial activity,” revoked Groundwork’s student-org 
status and mandated that the other co-ops hand over their 
books, accounts and management to the administration. 

Groundwork refused, so Carruthers agreed to work with 
students in addressing concerns of financial mismanagement 
on the part of the co-ops.

But the “war” was not yet won. At 1:15 a.m. on January 
15, 1992, Assistant Vice Chancellor Tommy Tucker and the 
UCSD Police Department entered the General Store Co-op in 
an administrative break-in to seize financial records. Finding 
none, they changed the locks. 

Tucker then told the Guardian that administrators feared 
the documents were being “doctored.” Though General Store 
members cried foul — citing their contract with the adminis-
tration, which required a 24-hour notice prior to administra-
tive entry —  Tucker claimed the action was legal. 

“This is a university building,” he told the Guardian. “It’s 
our operation and we can do what we want to do with it.” 

At 4 a.m. the same morning, General Store members — 
some of whom slept in the co-op overnight — changed the 
locks that Tucker had installed. Six hours later, at 10 a.m., 
Tucker returned with police officers and searched once again 
for financial records, leaving police to guard the store. By 2 
p.m., however, in rebellion worthy of the era from which the 
co-ops were born, hundreds of students forced the officers out

Madison Sheffield, an Eleanor 

Roosevelt College senior and member 
of the Sustainable Food Project, said 
she has been researching the role of 
the community in fostering sustainable 
growth. Sheffield.  helps quarry mate-
rials for the weekly course by organiza-
tion class discussions and planning 
topics.

The seminar approaches agricul-
tural food production as the root of 
American ancestry and dissects the 
American diet to spotlight the advan-
tages of on-campus gardening. As 
Saier mentions, one-fourth of all eco-
logical damage stems from raising live-
stock in the U.S.

By putting public focus on argo-
ecology and agribusiness, urban 
farms are modeling sustainable food 
systems while educating the popu-
lace. But the hands-on approach isn’t 
entirely novel — in the past, Saier has 
taught classes where students com-
plete independent research projects 
on his personal farm.

What is unique to the new-
est urban farm proposal for Pepper 
Canyon, however, is that according 
to Finkelstein, it’s an opportunity to 

ensure continuity, accountability and 
sustainability at the university.

“This isn’t just about growing food,” 
Finkelstein said. “It’s a place for the 
biology department to explore soil 
research, or psychology to learn more 
about alternative therapy.” 

Establishing an urban farm on 
campus, the Sustainable Food Project 
anticipates, will improve quality of life 
for both college students and the com-
munity, who have both vocalized their 
support. 

With a space where people can 
engage their scholarship with gloves 
and a motley garden, Buchanan said, 
the urban farm will foster an aware-
ness of water conservation and natural 
insect control.

The complications arising from the 
university’s inconstant student popula-
tion are also an issue the Food Project 
has already incorporated into its out-
line. By employing four interns and a 
farm manager to oversee the garden’s 
growth, a composite Farm Committee 
— made up of student and faculty rep-
resentatives as well as administrators 
— the project hopes to remain stably 
employed. 

Though the Che Cafe’s past intia-
tives have clashed with the univer-

sity because of political affliations, the 
Sustainable Food Project has made 
it clear that its goal is to collaborate 
and cooperate with the administra-
tion’s continued involvement. And not 
only with the administration, but also 
among departments, staff, community 
members and individual students on 
farm itself.

Currently the Sustainable Food 
Project is preparing for their May 27 
meeting with a council of vice chancel-
lors, where members will ask for the 
the university’s fiscal endorsement. If 
the project isn’t able to procure funds 
from adminstrators, however, they say 
they will be moving on to research the 
wealth of grants newly created by the 
federal economic stimulus plan.   

“We understand that the univer-
sity has other focuses and that UCSD 
isn’t an agricultural school — we 
have Davis and Santa Cruz for that,” 
Finkelstein said. “As environmental 
and health crises have come to light, 
UCSD has expressed interest in sus-
tainability, and you can’t have sus-
tainability without sustainable food 
systems.”

of the building and took back control 
of the General Store. A sit-in last-
ing several days followed, in which 
Senger himself was a participant. 

The following day, a Superior 
Court judge granted the co-ops a 
restraining order against the adminis-
tration. He then ordered the General 
Store to submit its financial docu-
ments to the UCSD Internal Audit 
office. Both sides hailed the ruling a 
victory. 

A year and a half of costly negotia-
tions followed. In 1993, a contentious 
Memorandum of Understanding 
was born, which governed relations 
between the co-ops, the adminis-
tration, the Associated Students 
Council and the Graduate Student 
Association. It was finalized two 
years later. 

The second major run-in between 
the co-ops and the administration 
concerned the Burn! Project, which 
Groundwork books managed in 
2000, before Che Cafe took over in 
2002. 

Originally established in 1993 by 
the communication department, the 
Burn! Project was an experiment in 
primary source media. Its Web site 
compiled, published and linked to 
content generated by various radi-
cal social movements, including the 
Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de 
Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo and 
the Kurdistan Workers Party, both 
considered “designated foreign ter-
rorist organizations” by the U.S. State 
Department. 

Not surprisingly, the university 
received a barrage of complaints dur-
ing the years of the project’s existence. 
However, UCSD remained commit-
ted to its students’ First Amendment 
rights, and webmaster Michael Breen 
told the San Francisco Chronicle in a 
May 9, 1997, article that the univer-
sity “tries very, very hard to err on the 

side of freedom of speech.” 
Dan Hallin, current chair of the 

communication department, told 
Time-Warner for a July 21, 1997, arti-
cle: “We’re proud that our students 
are part of that communications net-
work. We don’t see any reason to get 
rid of it because it’s controversial.”

After Groundwork Books took 
over Burn!, it was protected by the co-
ops’ status as student organizations, 
but they proved to be no match against 
the Bush Administration’s favorite 
weapon: the U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T. 
Act. In back-and-forth correspon-
dence from April to October 2002, 
the administration accused the co-
ops of violating UCSD policies and 
federal law by “providing material 
support” to “designated foreign ter-
rorist organizations.” 

The co-ops fired back with the 
First Amendment, but after months 
of legal analysis and disputes, the 
project was finally shut down. Today, 
try going to the Burn! Web site and 
all that appears is “ERROR” — stark, 
bold, capitalized letters spelling out 
censorship in all its patriotic glory.

The third major clash between 
the co-ops and administrators con-
cerned the lapse of their Master Space 
Agreement — a document resem-
bling a landlord-tenant contract —  
in 2000. The A. S. Council and the 
Graduate Student Association grant-
ed two two-year rental extensions; a 
third extension was in the works as 
early as Fall Quarter 2003.  

In minutes from a November 7, 
2003, Co-op Advisory Committee 
meeting, then-Vice President of 
the Graduate Student Association 
Lee Lovejoy stated that “renewal is 
not an issue, and there shouldn’t be 
any doubts about the co-ops’ exis-
tence.” However, according to the 
Co-op Oversight Committee’s April

23, 2004, meeting minutes, when the 
third extension was officially pro-
posed in spring 2004, administra-
tors stated it would not be allowed 
because the MOU, which established 
the MSA, had expired.

Negotiations worsened when, in 
a letter dated August 17, 2004, the 
administration stated the tenancy of 
the co-ops would be terminated if 
an agreement was not reached by 
October 15, 2004. This was later 
extended one month, to November 
15. 

The co-ops saw this as an evic-
tion notice. According to a statement 
made by one of their attorneys, Lottie 
Cohen, in a San Diego Union-Tribune 
article, it was just another attempt by 
the university to get rid of the co-ops 
once and for all. However, in a cam-
pus notice dated October 15, 2004, 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson claimed that nego-
tiations would “not affect the viability 
of the co-ops.” 

“We are committed to preserving 
and supporting [the] role [of the co-
ops],” Watson wrote in notice.  

After further negotiations, a com-
pletely new document was drafted: a 
“space agreement” between the co-
ops and the UC Board of Regents, 
replacing the MOU and MSA. It’s 
stated that the A. S. Council and the 
Graduate Student Association were 
to maintain oversight and dispute 
resolution roles, but were no longer 
“landlords” to the co-op “tenants.” 
Instead, the co-ops would pay rent 
directly to the university. 

During these negotiations, the 
co-ops were under month-to-month 
tenancy. According to Nguyen, they 
stopped paying rent because they 
were under no formal contract with 
the university. When the new space 
agreement was finalized in June 2006, 
the co-ops were billed $35,408.37 in 
back rent. 

Earlier this quarter, on April 15, 
the co-ops won a small victory when 
the A. S. Council voted unanimously 
to absorb this debt — substantial 
amounts of which the co-ops had 
already paid off.

Most recently, some members of 

the co-ops felt that the construc-
tion caused by expanding the Student 
Center and Price Center from 2006 
to 2008 obstructed their operations. 

During construction, the Food 
Co-op was severely limited in its 
functionality, the General Store suf-
fered a 40 percent drop in sales and 
Groundwork had to move three 
times. Furthermore, as a result of 
relocating the university’s “down-
town” to Price Center, the Student 
Center has been somewhat decentral-
ized as a hub of student activity and 
recreation, according to Rubens. 

He attributed these negative 
effects to a concerted effort by the 
administration to finally drive the 
co-ops out of business. 

However, according to current 
University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino, the success of the co-ops is 
important to the administration. 

“The investment that has gone 
into the expansion and renova-
tions for the Student Center speaks 
volumes of the [university’s] ongo-
ing commitment,” Terzino said in 
an e-mail. “The administration has 
spent countless hours working with 
the co-ops to find workable solutions 
to the many challenges that have sur-
faced over the years.” 

These recent “challenges” include 
the effects of construction on the 
Food Co-op, the Food Co-op’s failed 
Price Center satellite and Che Cafe’s 
three-month closure this year as a 
result of losing of insurance. 

Due to the Food Co-op’s lim-
ited operations during construction, 
the university granted a 50 percent 
rent reduction. However, although 
the General Store experienced a drop 
in sales, it did not receive a rent 
reduction because it remained fully 
operational. 

Terzino added that the university 
invested over $50,000 in the Food 
Co-op’s satellite venture in Price 
Center. The satellite location was 
first proposed in 2005, and was even 
included in the newly negotiated 
space agreement finalized in 2006. 
After a year of business, however, it 
closed down in 2007 —  according to 
both Terzino and the Food Co-op — 
due to operational challenges. 

The Che Cafe had to close down 
from January to March of this year, 
when its insurance company termi-
nated coverage upon missed pay-
ment. According to Barclay, the 
university was understanding of the 
Che’s situation, and even granted 
the cafe an extended grace period to 
secure new coverage.

The Cafe continues to be success-
ful, however, due to a devoted follow-
ing of students and community mem-
bers, Barklay said. Rubens, though, is 
unsure about the future of the co-ops. 

“The co-ops will always be here,” 
Rubens said. “We have one thing that’s 
always valuable and that’s student 
support. [But] I wouldn’t be surprised 
if in five years [the General Store] is 
a Chipotle and [Groundwork] is a 
Starbucks.” 

According to Nguyen, the Food 
Co-op’s sales before the University 
Centers expansion — and this current 
economic climate — were three times 
what they are now. Members have 
had to suspend payroll, and work on a 
volunteer basis. According to Senger, 
the same is true of Groundwork.

Terzino said the university’s plans 
for future expansion will serve to bol-
ster foot traffic to the Student Center. 

“The plans that the campus has 
for additional projects will bring 
more students and overall population 
to [the Student Center and co-ops], 
which can only enhance the poten-
tial customer base for all the mer-
chants in this area,” Terzino said in an 
e-mail. “The University Centers will 
continue to plan programs and events 
at the Student Center and work with 
the co-ops to address facilities-related 
issues and concerns.”

In the meantime, the co-ops are 
exploring other ways to expand ser-
vices and gain support from students. 
The General Store has a new textbook 
rental program, and Groundwork is 
entertaining a proposal by a literature 
professor to start an online intellec-
tual journal.

“There’s an old French saying,” 
Senger said. “La lutte continue — the 
struggle continues.”

changing our workouts a little bit 
to work on sprinting and timing,” 
Pinkerton said. “We had been strug-
gling to get our rating and hull 
speed up. We were really quite suc-
cessful [at the PCRCs].”

UCSD’s national championship 
chances were hindered by the high 
quality of its competition in com-
parison to the rest of the country. 

“Unfortunately, or fortunately 
depending on how you look at it, 
we play in one of the toughest 
regions,” Pinkerton said. “The way 
things are set up, there are only 
going to be two spots for our region 
at nationals.”

The Tritons, who placed second 
at the last two national champion-
ships, garnered some encouraging 
results at the regatta, even though 
their season was cut short. Their 
open eight and open four boats, 

comprised of a mix of varsity and 
novice racers, both placed second. 

UCSD’s novice four boat placed fifth 
in a field of seven, with all other 
teams coming from Division-I pro-

grams. 
“The success of those boats 

speaks well for our future,” 
Pinkerton said.

Moving forward, the Tritons will 
have their work cut out for them 
next season as they say goodbye to 
several seniors.

“I think every season is like a 
reset,” Pinkerton said. “We’re losing 
eight seniors and I don’t think the 
teams we’re racing against will be 
losing as many. But we have a lot of 
terrific novices and freshmen mov-
ing into the varsity next year. This 
has been one of the best teams that 
I’ve worked with in my 10 years. 
Over the past two or three years 
we’ve set the bar for other teams, 
and they’ve risen to the challenge. 
That says a lot about our women.”

The Triton women’s varsity eight boat placed third behind defending national champion Western Washington University and Humboldt State University.´Over the past two or three years we’ve set the bar for other teams, and they’ve 

risen to the challenge. 
That says a lot about 

our women.”

his best stuff,” O’Brien said. “The 
offense picked him up.” 

The Triton lineup continued its 
strong play into the second game 
of the tournament, cruising to an 
18-3 victory over Western Oregon 
on May 15. 

UCSD dominated throughout 
the contest, scoring in seven frames 
and putting up multiple runs in four 
separate innings. Decker allowed 13 
hits in seven innings at the Triton 
starter, but minimized the damage 
by only allowing two runs.

“I was just making quality pitch-
es when I had to,” Decker said. “I 
definitely did not have my best stuff 
by any means. But when the team 
needed me most, I clutched up, 
made the pitches and everything 
just fell into place. I just wasn’t try-
ing to do too much — I just stayed 
within myself and let the defense 
play behind me.”

Following their blowout win, the 
Tritons faced off against Sonoma 
State for the third time this postea-
son. The Seawolves staved off elimi-
nation with a 4-3 win, advancing 
to the championship game against 
UCSD. 

With the Tritons holding on to 
a slim one-run lead heading into 
the final frame, Sonoma State led 
off the top of the ninth with a 
single. Seawolf senior infielder Kris 
Haycock then put Sonoma State on 
top with a homer, giving Sonoma 
State the 4-3 win.

“One of their best players hit a 
two-run opposite field home run,” 
O’Brien said. “They had an oppor-
tunity in the ninth inning and got 
it done, and we had an opportunity 
but didn’t get it done. They just hap-
pened to get us that day.”

After falling to the Seawolves, 
the Tritons knew they had to bounce 
back for just one more win to make 
nationals.

“We didn’t talk a whole lot [after 
the game],” Decker said. “What got 

us going was knowing how hard we 
all worked and how close we were to 

winning the west region. Everyone 
took it upon themselves to play 
their best.”

UCSD was one of six teams that 
earned a spot in the D-II College 
World Series on Saturday, with the 
last two teams being decided today 
in the South and South Central 
Regional Championship games. 

The Tritons will travel to Cary, 
N.C., for their first game of the 
series on May 24 at 10 a.m., and 
O’Brien said he is confident that the 
team is ready for the challenge of 
facing the best of Division II.

“We’re not going to do anything 
different than what we have been 
doing,” he said. “We’re prepared for 
the College World Series.”

Game Seven: 
Where Amazing 
Doesn’t Happen
As the TNT NBA playoff anal-ysis winded down last night, with “Weird Al” Yankovic’s 
Michael Jackson parody “Fat” playing 
behind Charles Barkley’s cracks at 
Rockets forward Louis Scola’s “beer 
gut” (Chuck’s not really one to talk), 
I realized something. Sunday’s duo of 
games, which had the potential to be 
thrilling contests, just didn’t deliver.

Yesterday’s doubleheader of game 
sevens featured both of last season’s 
conference champions. On the brink 
of elimination, the Los Angeles Lakers 
and Boston Celtics fought to defend 
their titles. Or at least that’s what all 

the media hype leading up to the 
games told us was going to happen. 
In the end, the Lakers didn’t really 
fight — they simply started playing 
slightly better than awful — and the 
Celtics aren’t exactly the same team 
they were last year.

The Lakers defense decided to 
show up to Staples Center, but only 
because it needed to. Pretty much 
everyone could predict the outcome of 
this game. Faced with the prospect of 
elimination in just the second round, 
the defending Western Conference 
champions with arguably the most 
talented roster in the league showed 
some effort. And that’s all they needed 
to beat a Rockets team debilitated by 
injuries to their all-stars. 

Their Lakers’ defense wasn’t stel-
lar, but it was good enough.

Los Angeles held Scola in check 
— which shouldn’t have been a tough 
task without Yao Ming to worry about 
in the paint and Tracy McGrady to 
worry about all over the court — and 
got in the passing lanes to create turn-
overs and force the Rockets to play 
sloppy offense. But as jumbled as the 
Rockets were, the Lakers committed 
four more turnovers than Houston. 

The Lakers didn’t play well, but 
they played good enough.

Los Angeles should have been 
dominating the early rounds of the 
playoffs a la Michael Jordan’s Bulls 
teams if they are really looking for a 
championship this season. Because, 
from here on out, there won’t be any 
more “easy” playoff matchups. 

The team will now face a Denver 
Nuggets squad that has been impres-
sive thus far in the postseason. Still, 
there is no doubt that the Lakers still 
have more talent than the Nuggets. 
The conference finals will be a tough-
er test for Los Angeles, but it’s defi-
nitely one that the team should pass.

One thing is certain though: 
Against the Nuggets, good enough 
ain’t going to cut it. And good enough 
is definitely not going to make Los 
Angeles where “Amazing Happens.”

But with Kevin Garnett out, 
Orlando’s dominance over the Celtics 
wasn’t as sweet as I had hoped. Even 
though the big storyline of the game 
was a possible elimination for the 
defending champions, with KG on the 
sidelines, Boston just didn’t feel like 
the same team that won last season. 
And the fact that the Celtics weren’t 
able to keep the game competitive just 
made it boring. 

Here’s hoping Sunday was just an 
off day in the playoffs that have given 
us several thrills so far. Or maybe the 
Lakers will just make it to the finals by 
just playing good enough.

BASEBALL — After winning 39 
games, clinching a regular-season 
conference crown and taking the 
CCAA Tournament Championship, 
UCSD has a chance to claim the 
ultimate title in Division-II baseball. 
With their season on the line, the 
No. 2 Tritons stepped up in a big 
way, pouring on eight runs in the 
ninth inning against Sonoma State 
University, claiming their first West 
Regional title and advancing to the 
D-II College World Series for the 
first time.

“It’s really hard to describe the 
feelings and emotions,” senior pitch-
er Trevor Decker said. “It’s one of 
the greatest feelings. All of the hard 
work each person individually put 
in to achieve one of our goals — to 
make the College World Series and 
prove that we’re the best team.”

UCSD won its first two games 
of the regional tournament in 
Keizer, Ore., slipping past Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on May 
14 and crushing Western Oregon 
University on May 15. With their 
spot in the championship game 
already secured, the Tritons faced 
Sonoma State on May 17 to deter-
mine which team they would face 
in the title game. The Seawolves 
earned a comeback victory over 
UCSD to set up a rematch the next 

day.
Junior shortstop Vance Albitz led 

off the championship game with a 
double to right field and advanced 
to third on a groundout from senior 
third baseman Josh Tanner. Senior 
second baseman Garrett Imeson’s 
RBI groundout scored Albitz to give 
the Tritons a 1-0 lead.

The Seawolves answered back 
with a run off three hits in the bot-
tom of the first to tie the game. The 
two teams battled back and forth, 
putting up the same number of runs 
in the first eight innings to enter the 
ninth tied at four.

Redshirt junior Brandon 
Gregorich stepped up to the plate 
in the top of the ninth and drove the 
ball to left field for a leadoff single. 
Two hits and one UCSD run later, 
Sonoma State put in a new pitcher 
who promptly hit junior catcher 
Kellen Lee. The Tritons sent nine 
more batters to the plate, scoring 
eight runs to win the contest by a 
lopsided 12-4 score.

“It was just a matter of getting 
a break or two,” Decker said. “All 
day long we were finding barrels 
and hitting balls right at them. I 
don’t know if there was any one big 
moment, but what really got things 
going was when Kellen Lee got hit 
by a pitch which put runners on the 
corners. That fired us up and we 
poured it on.”

Junior outfielder Robert 

Sedin, senior designated hit-
ter Matt Cantele, Albitz, Imeson 
and Gregorich all recorded multi-
hit games, as the Tritons outhit 
the Seawolves 16-9. Sophomore 
Tim Shibuya pitched 2.2 scoreless 
innings for the win in relief of junior 
starter Kirby St. John.

The Tritons faced CSUDH to 
open the West Regional, facing the 
Toros for the second time this post-
season. In the teams’ first matchup 
in the CCAA Tournament, UCSD 
pulled off a close 2-1 victory, and 
while the rematch featured much 
more offense than the first game, 

the Tritons came out with another 
tight 11-10 win. 

Down 10-9 after seven innings, 
UCSD scored twice in the bot-
tom of the eighth to claim victory. 
Shibuya, who started the game for 
the Tritons, gave up six runs in 4.1 
innings. But UCSD’s offense put 
together 16 hits and senior pitcher 
Ryland MacFadyen earned the win 
in relief.

“We swung the bat really well 
against their starter which was big 
because Tim Shibuya did not have

Junior pitcher Kirby St. John threw five innings of three-run baseball, but earned a no-decision in the regional championship game that the Tritons won in the ninth inning. UCSD now travels to North Carolina for nationals.

UCSD scores eight runs in the ninth inning to break a 4-4 tie in the West Regional Championship.

WOMEN’S CREW — It wasn’t a 
failure in execution that cut UCSD’s 
season short at the Pacific Coast 
Rowing Championships last week-
end. The Tritons came in third at the 
event on May 16 in Lake Natoma, 
Calif., falling just shy of a spot in 
the NCAA Division-II National 
Championships. But despite the dis-
appointing results, the team record-

ed its fastest time all season at the 
regatta.

“We wanted to keep improving 
to the end of the season, and also to 
try to finish first or second in our 
region,” head coach Pattie Pinkerton 
said. “If we had finished first or 
second we would have had a chance 
at an at-large bid to the NCAAs. We 
did improve a lot — we got our best 
performance of the season — but it 
wasn’t fast enough.”

The Tritons weren’t the only ones 

who had their best race of the sea-
son at Lake Natoma. Competing in 
perfect racing weather, several of 
UCSD’s opponents also stepped up 
their game, forcing the Tritons to 
settle for third.

“Western Washington 
[University] won the last four 
national championships, and 
they turned in their fastest race,” 
Pinkerton said. “Humboldt State 
had their fastest race too, and we 
came in third.”

Dominating at the regatta, 
Western Washington won the var-
sity eight race by more than 20 sec-
onds and the varsity four by almost 
10 seconds. Humboldt State placed 
second in both of the races.

In preparation for the regatta, 
the Tritons mainly focused on 
improving their sprinting speed in 
an attempt to advance to nationals.

“We worked a lot on speed work,

Junior catcher Kellen Lee recorded one hit and scored a run in UCSD’s 12-4 victory over Sonoma State. 
The Tritons sent 13 batters to the plate in the ninth inning to claim their first Division-II regional crown.
