Campus expansion sparks 
~~f.~~.,,~~~luation 
I NCREASED campus growth and La Jolla's conti nued expansion has sparked 
admi nistrati on and campus 
police to review and research 
UCSD's overa ll safety. 

According to AI Jenkins. 
UC D's Crime Prevention 
Office r, "It stands to reason that 
crimes will go up. Our ampus is 

, very accessible. Police 
depanment ca lls go lip every 
year." 

To combat the potential crime 
problem ,Jenkins and Rape 
Prevemlon and Education 
Program Coordinator Mary Virga 
have reviewed the means by 
which someone III trouble may 
comact help. 

Seven ye llow emergency call 
boxes are located on cam pus 
that have a direct line to campus 
police. Originally there were 10 
boxes, but three were removed 
for construction . The use of the 
call box is quite si mple; after . 
opening the door and pressing 
the large red button , campus 
police will respond over the 
speaker. A red light above the 
box is illuminated at night. 

Up until a few weeks ago, 
Virga couldn't remember ever 
seeing an emergency call box. 
She says many women don't 
even realize that these call boxes 
exist or know where they are 
located. 

Jenkins said that new forms of 

eme rgency call boxes arc being 
tested in parking lot 604 near 
the BIO-Med Library and In the 
southwest parking lot at the 
Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography. Three to rour 
weeks ago, cellular phones were 
removed from the lots after being 
tested for three months. Two-way 
Motorola rad ios will be tested for 
three months to determine 
their feasibility as well. After 
testing is completed , the poli ce 
depanment will decide which 
system will be used. 

The current emergency ca ll 
boxes required trenches to be 
dug and wire laid in order to 
connect them to the system. 
Cellular phones and two-way 
radio communication would 
eliminate the need for wiring. 
This would allow the boxes to be 
installed and moved easily and 
cheaply if necessary. 

The 20 emergency fire phones 
and all elevator intercoms can 
also be used to contact campus 
police in emergencies. "It doesn't 
matter how we get the call , just 
that we get it," Jenkins said. 

Public and private telephones 
on campus can be used free of 
charge in emergencies by dialing 
911. Campus police will respond 
to the call. 

A Lighting Task Force recently 
gathered light illumination meter 
readings throughout the campus 
to detennine whether UCSD's 

lighting IS up to national 
standards. According to Jenkins. 
thiS study wi ll allow the 
UniverSity to determine wh.ere 
lighting is inadequate. Jenkins 
called th is "the most 
comprehensive lIght study in 
UCSD history." The Task Force's 
recommendations will be 
submitted to Vice Chancellor of 
Busi ness and Finance Steve 
Relyea February 27. 

Virga stressed the importan ce 
for women to call Community 
Service Officers (CSO's) if they 
have to walk alone at night. 
CSO's are male and female 
student employees who escort 
students and staff on campus. 
They can be identified by their 
ID's attached to their yellow 
Jackets. . 

Virga said, "Some women 
resent havi ng to call someone for 
help, but th e times are such that 
th ings can and do happen." 

Jenkins, also head of the CSO 
program, said that the number of 
calls for CSO's has increased 
every year since their inception. 
Last week, the service averaged 
50 calls a night. 

Six to eight CSO's are on call 
each night between 5:30 pm and 
1:30 am. After this time. campus 
police will escort those 
requesting the service. 

The police depanment 
provides bicycl,es to some of the 
CO's, but doesn't have enough 
to go around . Jenkins hopes to

[he While House announced [he

SACRAMENTO, UC Wire - A 
biU to ensure the "fairness and 
accuracy" of drug testing was 
unveiled by an asscmblymember 
who wa ntS 10 standardize and 
license the procedure. 

&cause there are no state or 
federal standards, drug testing is 
a "c risis waiting to happcn , 
where all Califomians -
employers and employees -come 
out losers," Assemblymember 
Johan Klehf said yesterday. 

"The escalating cost of drug 
and alcohol abuse at the 
workplace are a legitimate cause 
of concern ," he said . "The federal 
drug enforcement agency 
estimates that up to $50 billion 
is lost annually in absenteeism, 
lowered productivity. ineffective 
goods, accidents and medical 
and insured costs related to drug 
use." , 

More than 30 percent of the 

Fortune 500 Companies, 
including AT&T, Exxon and 
General Morors, require drug 
testing, so "it is too important an 
issue to be left to self regulation ," 
said Klehf, D-Alameda. 

"By establishing guidelines, the 
bill will "prevent the 
victimization of employers and 
employees." he sa id . "Ensuring 
the fairness and accuracy of 
these tests will prevent the false 
branding of innocent employees 
as drug users and unwarranted 
fi ring of valuable workers." 

Klehrs assembly bill 330 
establish es standards for 
substance abuse testing of 
employees and job applicants. 

It would require the state 
depanment of health services to 
develop regulation to ensure the 
effective licensure of laboratories, 
Klehf said. Currently, anyone 

Student Employees, ComPUteT Literates 
TAKE NOTICE! 

.. A.S. Lobby External 
Needs You .. 

Positions for students interested in active participation ' in the 
student lobby and related committees are now open: 

- Employee Relations Council 
The student wage policy recently proposed to U.c. 
systemwide administration calls for the establishment of 
a committee that will function as adviso ry to the 
chancellor. Interested student employees can contact: 

Erik R. Basil at 534·4450 
.. Work Study Advisory Committee 

This new committee needs a student with fi rst~hand 
knowledge of work~study programs and conditio ns to si t 

other supplies needed LO open a 
• drug testing lab. 

The bill would also require 
that employees and job 
applicants be ad\~sed of testing 
regulations in writing prior to 
testing and that test results be 
kept confidential. 

Employers would be required 
to "reasonably accommodate" any 
employee who wishes to 
voluntarily enter a drug or 
alcohol rehabilitation program. 

In addition , the bill would 
require employers to confirm 
positive test results wi th the 
more accurate lcsts at a qualified , 
state-monitored lab before taking 
action against an employee or 
job applicant. 

The confirmation IS needed , 
Klehf said , because more Lhan 90 
percent of testi ng labs registered 
"false pOSitive" results for four 
major drugs - ampheta mines, 
morphine , baroituates ~nd 
cocaine - more than 5 percent 
of the time. 

After 3 years of confirmation 
testing wlth gas chromatography, 
mass spectroscopy, the U.S. 
Army has yet 10 get a false 
positive result, he said , and 
Pharmchem has conducted over 
6,500 simtlar confirmation tests 
without a false positive . 

Although it would seem ideal 
to use the gas chromatography 
method for all tests , it is 100 slow 
and expensive for WIdespread 
use , Fogerson said. 

Klehf said his bill is only a 
start in the war against illegal 
drug use . "Education , 
rehabilitation and criminal 
justice - they're all needed." 

The bill is very Similar to one 
Gov. Deukme]ian vetoed last 
year, said Klehf, who believed 
that changes to the measure 
should guarantee legislative 
approval and the govemor's 
signature .

Herman M. Fritz . The 
establishment was referred to as 
a "buffet for men ;" women were

modem grill was added and the 
rules were changed . Customers 
ranged from businessmen to 
service workers to theatre goers.

In late '32. the restaurant moved a 
few blocks north to another 
loca[lon. In 1965, then located 
on EI Cajon Boulevard . the 
Golden LIOn was closed and put 
up for sale . Now. under new 
owners, the Gaslamp building 
has been restored. 

The restoration of the 
restaurant in 1983 was at the 
forefront of the re.developing 
which occurred throughout much 
of the downtown Gaslamp area. 

The Golden Lion re·opened one 
year before the construction of 
Horton Plaza was finished . 

The design , a San Francisco 
saloon.type eatery. was popular 
at the tum of the century. Most 
of the original tile Ooor, found 
beneath a thick layer of concrete , 
remains . as well as some of the 
origina l murals. 

In the center of the ceiling is a 
stained glass dome, twenty· five 
feet in diameter and comparable

to the stained glass found in the 
fanciest cathedrals. The waUs 
and ceiling are painted in an 
intricate design and around the 
edge of the ceiling is a detailed 
crown molding reproduced from 
the original. Old photographs 
and newspaper clippings adorn 
the walls. Maintaining good 
rapport with customers, "good 
food , good drink and good 
people." is the goal of the 
management , Arclga said .

Galdikas has dedicated her life [0 the study 
of the orangutans of the rainforests of 

Orangutans are in danger of extinction nOl

orangutans' habitat are being turned into 
[arms and logging sites, but also because 
wealthy Indonesians inSiSt on trying to 

keep them as e otic pets. While the Impulse to tum 
orangs into companions IS destruCllvc , Galdlkas 
understands the Impluse--with orangs, perceptions of 
human and animal behaVIor tend to blur. -They use 
tools, like to wear bi ts and pieces of clothing, love Junk 
food and candy and want constant attention and 
affection. They express emotions such as anger alld 
embarrassment In a wa), that seems very like humans.

The evening slilned OUl well 
for thc Triton!> who rallied from 
a 5-0 deficil to take the first

\XIhen Shanda Elzy gets wound up there's no accounting for 
what she might do in hoopland. And in December this 5'7" point 
guard was unstoppable as she led the Tritons in both their offensive 
and defensive strikes, averaging per game: six points, 6.4 rebounds, 
5.2 assists and 5.3 steals. _ 

She was named AII-Toumament at both the Redlands 
Tournament and the Tritons' own La Jolla Classic Tournament. 

"Shanda is our leader both on offense and on defense," said 
coach Judy Malone. "On offense she gets the ball to the scorers and 
on defense she is incomparable. Her aggressive ball-hawking 
defense keeps us in the game. She is the best point guard in the 
West," says Malone. 

For her outstanding play in two December tournaments and for 
her continued contribution to Triton IM)men's basketball, UCSD 
Athletics is pleased to award Shanda Elzy the honor of co-Bud Ught 
Athlete-of-the-Month.

Tritons 
defeat 
Titans 

rugby • In 
By JOSHUA WEll 

T HE uc San Diego Rugby Team openec( its league Saturday, rnllin£ ov~r 
Cal-Stare Fullerton 23-u in lront 
of about 50 partisan fans . 

The Tritons greater experience 
at the forward positions became 
evident as San Diego won nearly 
80 percent of the ball. UCSD's 
backs then made good on the 
possessions with a number of 
long IUns. The pace of the game 
was set early when the Tritons 
recovered their own opening 
kickoff. Less than twO minutes 
later fly-half Dean Schliefer 
scooped up a loose ball and 
touched ir down for a four point 
try. Winger John TeUenback 
missed the two point conversion 
kick, but he made good on three 
three-point penalty ki cks before 
the half was up , giving San Diego 
a 13-0 lead. 

The Tritons continued to 
dominate the second half, 
though the intens ity level did 
drop. "We played a good game: 
Tom Butler said , UCSD head 
coach, "but we're still not an 80 
minute team. We will continue to 
work on conditioning." 

Conditioned or not, the 
second half belonged to loose 
forward Mike Benhorin who 
scored two trys, his first of the 
year. The first came off a shovel 
pass from Mike Wensley on a 
well executed penalty play from 
about 15 meters OUl. Benhorin's 
second try came when he burst 
through a line to pick up a 
deflected ball and ran 10 meters 
untouched for the score. 
Tellenback convened and the 
Tritons had theIr final 23 point 
margin. ext Saturday UCSD 
travels to USC for a league game 
and [he following weekend (Feb. 
14 &: 15) th e Tritons will play in 
the OMBAC Invitational 
Tournament at Mission Beach's 
Robb Field . San Diego's next 
home game will be March 7 
against UC IlVine.
