Unfair Selections 
BERKELEY - Several partici-
pants and observers of last 
Wednesday ' s UC Berkeley 
cheerleading tryouts are planning 
to file a complaint with the chan-
cellor and athletic director, alleg-
ing that the criteria for choosing 
the 1995-96 team were not based 
on talcntalone. According to op-
ponents of the selection process, 
the judges tried to choose women 
who would fit a certain image 
and excluded certain ethnic 
groups and physical appearances. 
Of the six members of last year's 
team eligible to tryout this year, 
only one did so, and at least one 
quit because she said she felt the 
issue of racial bias was being 
ignored. Members of last year's 
squad circulated a petition last 
November claiming similar ra-
cial biases.

Demand for On-
Campus Housing 
Exceeds Supply 
At Warren 
RESIDENTIAL UFE: Over 300 
students placed on the waiting list 
for All-campus apartments 
By Marianne VIlli 
Associate News Editor 

Hundreds of students were turned away from 
Tuesday's on-campus housing lottery at the Price 
Center, leaving many in jeopardy of not being able to 
live on campus next year. 

Over 300 students were placed on a waiting list for 
All-campus housing and approximately 200 students 
were placed on the waiting list for Warren College. 
Other colleges did not suffer from any serious housing 
shortages. 

All-campus housing, which is located at Black Hall 
and Brennan Hall at Warren College, gives students 
who live on campus an opportunity to share apart-
ments with students from other colleges. 

Demand for All-campus housi ng far exceeded the 
available space, with approximately 650 people ap-
plying for a little more than 300 spaces.

"Double the amount of students applied fo r AII-

Resident Dean Claire Palmer.

campus room lottery on Tuesday, but will be offered

According to Palmer, non-guaranteed students who 

did not receive All-campus housing either placed 
themselves on a waiting list for All-campus housing or 
in the housing lotteries at their own colleges. 

Warren students who were not guaranteed and 
were not given a space on campus will be placed on a 
waiting list until available housing at other colleges is 
found. According to Director of Housing and Dining

VOTE: UNITE slate gains 
two more postions in student 
government 
By Ben EI&ln 
Associate News Editor 

Robinson finished in a close second place 
in last week's elections, but managed to edge 
out Joanna Cheng with 55.1 percent of 
yesterday's tally. 

"All of those students who were guaranteed will 
receive a space and ... a majority of [non-guaranteed] 
students will be offered a space," Barrett said. 

The UNITE slate fared well in yesterday's 
A.S. run-off elections, with UCSD voters 
choosing Jennifer Nicoll as vice president 
administrative and Edmondo Robinson as 
vice president finance. 

Nicoll, who won last week's four-person 
race with less than the required majority, 
defeated Tom Schmitt by garnering 73.4 

Both candidates ran under the UNITE 
slate, an acronym for Uniting New Ideas 
Through Experience. The slate went unde-
feated, as Damien Wilpitz and Souley Diallo 
won their A.S. positions outright in the first 
tally. 

Barrett added that the shortage of housing does not 
necessarily reflect an increase in enrollment, but rather 
an increased interest in living on campus .• 

Palmer agreed saying, "We simply have more 
people that want to live on campus than we have room 
for."

Food Co-op Requests UCAB Rent Waiver for Summer 
FINANCE: A.S. passes 
resolution in support of 
bid for waiver 
By NIna Boulhton 
Staff Writer 

Seeking a rental waiver for the 
summer quarter to streamline its 
business practices, the Food Coop-
erative last week solicited support 
from the Associated Students and 
formally requested a waiver from 
the University Centers Advisory 
Board (UCAB). 

Food Co-op collective member 

Paul Petrick said the Food Co-op 
will close for the summer because 
the lack of clientele forces it to take 
a financial loss. He added that the it 
could cover the summer rent (around 
$704 per month) but would be better 
off financially if it did not have to do, 
so. 

"Expectations of loss [are] 
around $9,000, give or take $1,500. 
[So] we're going to be closed for the 
summer," said Petrick. 

Food Co-op collective member 
Erin Holve said the co-op were un-
der the impression that Soft Re-
serves and Assorted Vinyl did not 

pay rent over the summer from their 
owners and managers. 

"Initially, we thought other busi-
nesses got their rent waived. Essen-
tially we' re trying to do this .. . as a 
good business practice," said Holve. 

UCAB Chair Gabriela Juarez 
said UCAB does not waive rent for 
any businesses, but that some nine-
month contracts may make it appear 
as though rent were being waived. 

"They either pay [the total rent] 
over nine months or in a lump sum 
at the end of the year," said Juarez. 

The A.S. Council passed a reso-
lution last week supporting the co-

op's bid for the summer-rental 
waiver from UCAB, and Food Co-
op members and A.S. President 
Carla Tesak spoke with UCAB at its 
meeting Monday afternoon. 

Petrick said UCAB seemed to 
recognize that closing for the sum-
mer was in theco-op's best interest. 
However, he said UCAB members 
wanted the A.S. rather than UCAB 
to pay for the rent. 

Tesak echoed Petrick's senti-
ment, saying that UCAB members 
did not seem to be in favor of the co-
op's request that UCAB waive its

Extension of Drop 
Period Defeated 
REGISTRAnON: CEP cites pressure on facutty as 
reason for not approving five-week deadline 
ByJonn.p......, 
Associate News Editor 

their grades in a class to determine 
whether or not to drop that class. 

Despite efforts by two Associ-
ated Students (A.S.) representatives 
last quarter to extend the deadline 
for students to drop a class without 
receiving a 'W' on their transcripts, 
the Committee on Educational 

"The kind of grade you're likely 
to get is not the right reason for 
dropping a course," said 
Mosshammer. "They should make 
that decision early and not use a 
grade [to decide]." 

Policy (CEP) de-
cided last month not 
to push back the date 
to drop classes. 

The CEP, a sub-
committee of the 
Academic Senate, 
made its unanimous 
decision last March 
after hearing testi-
mony from A.S. 
Comissioner of 
Academic Affairs 
Vince Bonotto and 
his predecessor, 
David Valentine. 

According to 
Bonolto, Valentine 
developed the idea 
of trying to extend 
the date to drop 
without a 'W' dur-
ing his tenure as 
comissioner. Valen-
tine in tum worked 
with his successor, 
Bonolfo, on argu-
ments to present to 
the CEP before he 
resigned his post to 
go trekking in Nepal 
at the end ofWinler 
Quarter. 

"The fourth 
week comes and 
goes before [stu-
dents have] any real 
knowledge of their

Bonolto. " We felt

Mosshammer 
said that added pres-
sure on faculty 
memberswasoneof 
the principle re~­
sons for not approv-
ing the five-week 
drop period. 

According to 
8onolto, the com-
mittee felt the four-
week deadline was 
plenty of time to get 
a syllabus for the 
course and develop 
an idea of what kind 
of work was going 
to be expected. 

Mosshammer 
said the option to 
drop a class with a 
'W' was originally 
established about 15 
years ago. Before 
that time, students 
were allowed to 
drop classes through 
the sixth week oflhe 
quarter, but there 
was no withdrawal 
period after thaI. 

However, 
Mosshammer said 
that, at the time, the 
committee did not 
want students to feel 
that they could drop 
classes at the end of

ally having grades on their mid-
terms." 

"The general feeling is that the 
system we have is a good compro-
mise," Mosshammer said. B<>notto said that he and Valen-

tine intended to have the deadline 
pushed back one week to allow stu-
dents to drop a class without the 'W' 
grade through the fifth week of 
classes. 

According to CEPChairman and 
UCSD History Professor Alden 
Mosshammer, the committee did not 
feel that students should be using 

Bonollo did not agree with 
Mosshammer's assessment. "I think 
[an extended drop period] is some-
thing that could really benefit stu-
dents," he said. He added that he 
hoped that new commissioner of 
academic affairs, Damien Wilpilz, 
would pursue ' the proposal again 
next year.

ELECfION: 
ContInued from ..... 1 

"UNITE started off as a grass-
roots movement," said Nicoll. "We 
don't support any specific; interest 
group, [but] we appeil to all stu-
dents." 

"All of our candidates have 
strong, concrete ideas ... and we all 
have experience in A.S.," she added. 

In two other run-off contests, 
Muir voie~ elected Justin Farar (63 
percent) IS their junior senator and 
Roosevelt students chose Loren 
Kinczel (53.4 percent) as their 
sophomore senator. 

A.S. election bylaws state that 
elections must be decided in a run-
off between the two top vote-getters 
if the winning candidate does not • 
capture a majority of the votes. 

Nicoll was not surprised to see 
the multi-candidate race for V.P. 
administrative wind up in a runoff. 

" With four candidates in my elec-
tion I was kind of expecting that," 
said Nicoll. 

Only 4.7 percent of the student 
body cast ballots in the run-off, re-
inforcing the theory that the fee-
referenda was responsible for in-
creasing voter-turnout. 

"We were just joking around at 
the A.S. office, saying that we should 
have a football referendum on the 
ballot every year," said Elections 
Manager Mike Lindstrom. 

This year's 23 percent turnout 
was last topped in 1984.

Flftll Week 'w' Should 
Have Made the Grade 

The Committee on Educational Policy (CEP) recently nixed 
A.S. academic affairs' proposal to extend the 'W' drop date to 
the fifth week of the quarter. According to CEP Chairman 
Alden Mosslammer, one of the main reasons the committee 
did not approve the later drop period was because it would put 
too much pressure on faculty to get midterms out and graded 
by fifth week. . 

However, if professors can't hand out and grade midterms 
by the fifth week, how can they ~ibly do it by fo~rth week? 
An extended drop period would gtve faculty more lime to 
draw up and grade comprehensive exams, which measure not 
only the performance of students, but professors as well. 

In addition, this proposal would not have mandated that 
professors hold exams, it only called for them to grade and 
return any exams which might be given by the end of the fifth 
week. 

Extending the drop period would have allowed students a 
little more leeway to fmd out what kind of progress they are 
making in their classes. Currently, many professors give exams 
during the fourth week, but don't hand them back until after 
the last ~ay to drop without a 'W.' This forces many students 
to drop 'even before finding out their course grades. . 

In evaluating papers and midterms, the pro~essor ~so glll~ 
some idea of his own performance. However, if he walts until 
the qtd of file quarter, it will be too late for anyone - either 
stud~n~-,0r pi9f~580~ - ,lq ,~nc{it from any sort of evalua-
tion. l' 

Because: midterms serve as a measure of both student and 
profCS50r PlCrformance, they are a crucial indicator of whether 
or not students can succeed in' a course. If professors fmd it too 
difficult to grade and return exams within five weeks, they 
should find an easier job. 

'EARTH'.' Awards Degrade 
Earth Day'. Credibility 

Now in its 25th year, Earth Day has certainly deviated from 
its original mission to "shake the political establishment out of 
its lethargy," to use the words of Earth Day found~r. Gaylord 
Nelson. Once solidly grounded on grass-roots actlVISDl, Earth 
Day now has the air of a trendy, feel-good festival, replete with 
big business sponsors touting their "greenness." 

But Earth Day San Diego has managed to shock even the 
most cynical with its Environmental Achievement ~d Rest?" 
ration That Helps (EARIlIies) awards. The EARI'Hlcs, whIch 
will be presented today at the Scripps Stephen-Birch 
Aquarium, are intended to honor local businesses and ~titu­
tions which have made significant strides on the ecologIcal 
front Over 30 businesses applied for the awards, and accord-
ing to San Diego Earth Day board lI!ember Carolyn Otase, 
"'Ibis was a situation where all applIcants truly deserve 
recognition for their work. I was impressed by the range of 
businesses with enviroomental commitments ...... 

However, Chase's assessment has angered many local 
environmental groups. And rightly so. Among lbe worthy 
FARTIfie award-winners are some stunning indiscretions, 
includingAT..tT, SOS-Tbomas Microelectronics, Inc:: and the 
U.S. Navy Aeet and Industrial Supply Center, The U.S. Navy, 
which will be presented with an honorable mention, is perhaps 
one of the biggest polluters in San Diego. And although the 
Aeet and Industrial Supply Center may have reduced its toxic 
output, to honor it and other such organizations as "green" is 
nothing less than ludicrous.

could care even 
less who is run-
ning for the 
next commis-

tions/services and enterprise. Let's 
face it: Naomi Faile and John Barnes 
are ItUdent politicians who take some 
sort of perverse pleasure in student 
politics. The student government 
scene is among the least interesting 
and most Uleless of endeavors, partly 
because old people, also known u the 
UC Board of Regents and the UCSD 
administration, thwart it at every tum, 
and partly because the majority of stu-
dents know next to nothing about cam-
pus politics. 

YeI, this year's election was inter-
esting enough to garner 23 percent of 
the student population - a pathetic 
number even for American elections, 
but a huge success according to A.S, 
standards. However, it is safe to say 
that the candidates didn't bring out the 
voters. How many of you ICtuaIly read

And for all those who are still whining

COMMENTARY: Those who go to nightclubs have their own rules for what to wear and how to behave _ 
women must wear skimpy dresses, men must wear whatever is comfortable and everyone must get drunk 

JENNY 

LInn 

I don't think it's a 
coincidence that the 
expression "clubbing" 
conjures up the image 
of battering someone 
over the head with a 
blunt instrument. Make 
no mistake, I love go-
ing dancing, and, over-
all, f have a lot of fun 
when I go out for a 
night on the town. But 
certain elements of the 
experience are curi-

Jaundiced I ously disagreeable and, 
at the same time, fas-
cinatinglyentertaining. 

For example, drinking is a key part of go-
• ing to clubs which leaves a lot to be desired. 

It's an essential component of the evening 
for several reasons. First, people standing 
around chatting seem to have a need for a 
drink in hand. Second, after a long bout of 
dancing, you're dying for a drink, And then 
there's the matter of inhibitions. I know sev-
eral men who will not venture near the dance 
floor until consuming approximately 27 
beers. 

Club owners understand the high value of 
drinks in this situation, and they price them 
accordingly, No matter what you order, from 
Coke to Courvoisier, it always seems to cost 
$7.50. And if you buy a round of drinks for 
your friends, your Visa bill next month will 
indeed make you feel as if you've been hit 
over the head, 

Simply getting the drinks is enough of 
an endeavor: There's 'little enjoyment in 
strong-arming your way through the thicket 
of drinkers surrounding the bar, frantically 

PAINTING THE TOWN DREAD 
gesturing at the only bar-
tender who is standing 20 
feet away, and then hav-
ing huge sums of money 
extorted when you finally 
do succeed in obtaining a 
drink, 

There's another reason 
why buying drinks is so 
disagreeable, You must 
disengage yourself from 
your group and walk to 
the bar, As a woman, es-
pecially if you go alone, 
this is an adventure in it-
self: It requires you to 
pass by the throng of 
single men standing next 
to the bar who are check-
ing out all the women. 
When you walk by, you '1\ 
get The Look, Every 
woman of any age knows 
The Look - the cool, in-
solent, tip-to-toe ap-
praisal that makes me 
think they will lean over 
to their friend and say, 
"Whaddya think, $1.87 a 
pound?" For many years 
I would just look away, 
but now I stare back. It's 
fun, Try it. 

The boys at the bar 
have ample entertain-
ment, as hundreds of

, ... I would Just 
look aw." but now 
I star. back. 

to the conclusion that I 
am woefully uncool, I 
forgot, as I got dressed to 
go out, that on page 126 
of the American 
Nightlife Style Manual, 
there is the following 
prescription: 

FEMALE: Wear a 
black dress three sizes 
too smalltlult covers an 
approximate range of 
fksll from just above the 
belly button to just below 
the belly button. Wear 
high heels tlull will trip 
you up and give you blis-
krs, 

MALE: Wear any-
tlting you want, as long as 
it's comforl4bk. 

After we arrived at E 
Street, I realized f had 
committed the unforgiv-
able error of wearing a 
dress with - gasp -
sleeves, and - gasp _ 
flat shoes. But I felt quite 
stylish, mind you, until 
the Restroom Experi-
ence, 

My friend went with 
me, Guys, there's a rea-
son why women must go 
to the restroom in 

scantily dressed women parade back and 
forth before them all night. Nightclub fash-
ion fascinates me to no end, After a night at 
a club by the name of E Street, I have come 

groups, and it has noth-
ing to do with talking about our dates (al-
though we do that, too), It's about moral 
support. I never would have survived it with-
out her, 

In we walk, and the first thing we see is a 
wall, behind which there must have been a 
mirror, given that a phalanx of black-stock-
inged, high-heeled women were grimly en-
gaged in a relentless assault on eyelashes, 
lips and hair, Squeezing by women fluffing 
their hairstyles and tugging at their nylons, I 
gamely ventured toward the mirror, Sand-
wiched between a strapless red minidress and 
a black velvet bodysuit and leather skirt, I 
felt like a woman who'd dressed for a church 
ice-cream social and had somehow ended up 
in a bordello, 

The Restroom Experience always amazes 
me for philosophical reasons. If that flock of 
single guys standing around the bar are as 
desperate as their hungry looks would imply, 
why do women engage in this makeover cir-
cus? Why is the human male, unlike his ani-
mal counterparts, allowed to dress in the quiet 
feathers of Polo shirts and khakis, while we 
females must don bright plumage to attract 
him? It's a bizarre state of nature, 

Aside from this, practical considerations 
are equally intriguing. Page 127 of the Ameri-
can Nightlife Style Manual reads: 

When going out dancing, a woman may 
bring a purse, but it must be so small that it 
serves no purpose except decoration, Any 
items the woman should require duri~ the 
evening are deposited in her escort's jacket 
pockets. 

Hell, even I know that. My purse was tiny 
and barely held a driver's license; '1lfew 
folded bills and Iipstick.'Tht ~Ieelr CrtaIures 
at the mirror were of course even more stud-
ied than I in the art of correct clubbing be-
havior, and moR-didn'" evon catty'f'U1Hs.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thursday, April 20, 1995 

'WALK' IS THE ANSWER TO ALL OUR PRAYERS 
EdItor: 

I would like to dispel some ru-
mors I have heard in recent days. 
The piles of dirt which have been 
accumulating in front of the U niver-
sity Ubrary are not a part of a new 
Stuart Collection exhibit symboliz-
ing the inner workings of the admin-
istration. Rather, they are a part of 
the "Library Walk" project which 
will widen the 26-foot-wide walk-
way between the Price Center and 
the Central Library to a whopping 
3O-foot-wide promenade. I am sure 
many of you remember the traffic 
jams all of III experienced trying to 
get to the library during rush hours. 
You will be happy to know that this 
will no longer be the case. The 
added joy you'll experience from 
the new two-color pavement, in 
contrast tolhe insufferably monoto-
nous .grey pavement, goes without 
saying. 

In case some students are 
slightly confused, let me explain 
that this confusion arises from the 
fact that you are simply students-
you have not yet gone down the 
long educational road which leads 
to a doctorate or a professional de-
gree, as the architects, planners and 
UCSD faculty members who sat

through the 185 committee meet-
ings (official figure) which re-
viewed the project have. If you had, 
you would understand why these 
highly qualified individuals have 
advised Chancellor Atkinson that 
the best way to make a 26-foot-
wide walkway into a 30-foot-wide . 
walkway is to remove 270 trees, 
pile up tons of dirt and spend nearly 
$3 million in the process. Because 
as students you are young and in-
experienced. You may have naively 
thought that it might have been 
preferable to leave things as they 
were. Let me assure you, however, 
that after you spend the thousands 
of dollars needed to become edu-
cated here at UCSD, you will get 
your money's worth and under-
stand how these things work. You 
may even become a faculty mem-
ber (as I am) and sit on one of these. 
committees yourself. 

Not that the chancellor would 
need any advice from these com-
mittees concerning how to spend 
his discretionary funds, as he cer-
tainly knows that buying books for 
the library, keeping tuition costs 
down or funding student scholar-
ships are worthwhile goals consis-
tent with the university's mission. 

After braving the restroom, we 
returned to our group and then 
headed out to the dance floor. In

However, he is likely to be aware 
of other facts which are not obvi-
ous to you but may be of even 
greater importance to the 
university's mission. Creating a 
view corridor to the Central Library 
from Gilman Dr., which has been 
achieved by removing 270 trees, 
will bring enormous benefits to the

university, including: 
• students walking along Library 

Walk will see the library from up to 
1,000 feet away and remember that 
they have to go there to study for 
their next quiz or exam, thus signifi-
cantly enhancing their academic 
performance; 

• researchers and scholars will be 
inspired by new ideas when admir-
ing the library from a distance; 

• visitors coming to the campus 
through Gilman Dr. will not have 
to repeatedly ask for directions to 
the library, thereby saving univer-
sity community members precious 
time. 

• The university will not have to 
print thousands of maps for people 
who can't easily find the library, 
thus saving lots of trees (more than 
270); 

• the view corridor and straight 
path to the library will allow people 
who have difficulty reading maps to 
reach the library easily, therefore 
increasing the pool of library users; 

• many visitors will have a 
chance to catch a glimpse of the li-
brary from a distance, leading them 
to appreciate the essence of UCSD 
as an educational institution at the 
forefront of higher learning; 

Maybe it will even be a look that 
makes the American Nightlife Sty Ie 
Manual. 

Returning home from a night 
out, you realize your clothes reek 
of smoke, your leather jacket is 
stained with beer, you can't hear 
because you were dancing too close 
to the speakers, you have about $2 

• UCSD will attract the best 
scholars and the best prospective 
students with its reputation for hav-
ing the best view corridor leading 
to the most impressive library build-
ing in the world, thus enhancing the 
university's standing and the 
chancellor's prestige. 

Of course, there is the unfortu-
nate fact that 680 new trees are to 
be planted to replace the 270 lost, 
which will eventually block the 
view corridor when they mature. 
However, if we are lucky, there will 
be enough droughts in the future 
which will slow the trees' growth. 
Ten years from now, when some 
trees sbtrt to block the view of the 
library, perhaps one of the trees 
will become infected by the euca-
lyptus beetle, in which case it and 
the other 679 trees will have to be 
cut down to avoid an outbreak. 
Then we would have another 10 
years to benefit from viewing the 
library. 

I would like to clarify that these 
opinions are my own and do not rep-
resent my employers, the adminis-
tration, planners, architects or any 
other organization.

EI/ECI'IONS: 
A.S. political 
shenanigans again 
Continued from.,... 4 
measures and referenda of which 
they ,had absolutely no information 
outside of the GUlJrdian. Sure, fly-
ers were taped across every other 
squarejm:h of the campus, but who 
believes what politicians say about 
themselves? 

The ballot pamphlets which the 
pollsters handed out to voters were 
even worse. For example, concem-
ing Constitutional Measure C, the 
pamphlet read: "Changes the mem-
bership of the A.S. Council to 
change elected commissioner posi- . 
tions to appointed and adds five 
Campus Wide representatives," 

, What does this mean? Sure, it's not 
professional legalese, but the ama-
teur stuff doesn't convey much 
meaning to the everyday voter, ei-
ther. This measure was nothing less 
than an attempt to establish a sys-
tem of nepotism in place of democ-
racy. The four commissioner posi-
tions would have been awarded to 
people who had supported the vic-
torious 'politicians, or worse yet, 
simply given to friends of politi-
cians under a pretext of experience. 
'Suppose the student body elected a 
Greek 10 AS. president. What do 
you think the chances are of four 
G,reeks -representing" the student 
body rather than the interests of the 
AS. president in the council? The 
scariest thing, however, is that this 
measure actually received a simple 
majority. Good thing it didn't win 
the two-thirds majority it needed to 
peas. How many votes would it have 
obtained if this information had 
been available? 

The Guardian was the only 
source of information which tried 
to outline and explain the signifi-
cance of each issue, much 10 the 
anguish of those whose candidates, 

referenda and measures didn't re-
ceive an endorsement. However, 
these news fealures and commen-
taries were, for the most part, pre-
sented a couple weeks before the 
elections. ) 

Undoubtedly the Guardian 
played an important role in AS. 
elections this year, as it probably has 
every year. But it shouldn't be the 
only source of information which 
outlines and presents the pros and 
cons of a candidate or an issue. 

All of this year's candidates 
would have told you that they want 
to make the AS. more accessible to 
the students and get them ITlQre in-
volved in the government process. 
As V.P. administrative, Barnes re-
laxed the public-speaking rules to 
make the AS. more accessible to 
students, and Falk has proposed 
making A.S. officials hold "office 
hours" in public places. She has also 
proposed holding meetings at a dif-
ferent colleg~ campus each week to 
get students involved. However, if 
the A.S. wants students to become 
more involved in the election pro-
cess, it should make a greater at-
tempt at informing them about the 
issues. The AS. could take a hint 
from the state and make a sample 
ballot available to the students, pre-
senting objective, informative argu-
ments and counterarguments of both 
sides. 

Whatever it does, the A.S. will 
never experience such a wide voter 
turnout again unless one of two 
things happens: either the council 
places another misguided referen-
dum involving money on the ballot 
or tbe voters are given more infor-
mation about the issues at hAnd. In-
stead of placing another inane idea 
on next year's ballot, tbe A.S. 
should infoma students of its age_ 
through objective publicity . . Not 
until students have a clear vieW of 
the A.5. candidates' platforms can 
they be expected to actively partici-
pate in AS. issues.

"As a board we really don't have 
a stand right now. We're still all 
reading up on it. We tabled [the 
issue] until our next meeting." said 
Juarez. 

University Center Director Jim 
Carruthers said UCAB has agree-
ments that are year round. but added 
that the A.S. 's and University 
Center's business managers are 
looking into how those agreements 
are actually being paid.

from UCAB because the A.S. has 
found a source of funding which 
could cover the cost of its summer

"[A.S.] gels S5,OOO from UCAB 
for the Co-op Oversight Commit-
tee. [We'll] possibly pay the rent 
from there .... I think [this issue] is 
resolved," said Tesak. 

Both Juarez and carruthers said 
they would be in favor of such a 
proposal. 

"I think the Oversight Commit-
tee has it within their boundaries to 
solve this problem," said 
Carruthers. 

Juarez added, "If the Co-op 

r 

Oversight Committee thinks this is 
the best way to do it, then by all 
means let's take that route." 

However, Petrick and Holve said 
they were unsure how Food Co-op 
members would react to this new 
proposal would be. 

"There's been no decision here 
as [to] what to do about that offer 
because of the political strings that 
could be attached to the offer," said 
Petrick. 

Holve added that the co-op was 
concerned about appearing to be 
asking for special favors. She also 
stressed that the co-op members 
were still fact-finding and would 
not be able to resolve this issue in a

An explosion at the Scripps 
Research Institute last Saturday 
injured one scientist so severely 
that he was sent to the bum center 
of the UCSD Medical Center in 
Hillcrest. 

The post-graduate researcher, 
whose name was withheld at the 
request of his family, was working 
in the lab of UCSD chemistry de-
partment Chair K.C. Nicolaou at 
about 9:50 p.m., when the lithium 
aluminum hydride he was experi-
menting with exploded. 

According to Scripps spokes-
woman Robin Goldsmith, the ex-
plosion was confined to a fume 
hood, a device intended to keep 
gases and vapors confined and away 
from the experimenter. 

Lithium aluminum hydride is a 
volatile white crystalline powder 
which reacts with water to produce 
explosive hydrogen gas and corro-

Goldsmith said the researcher 

was wearing gloves and protec-
tive goggles. and that all appli-
cable safety precautions had been 
taken. 

According to Goldsmith. the 
damage to the lab was mostly lim-
ited to broken glass. She added that 
another researcher extinguished the 
fire within seconds. 

Nicolaou's research focuses on 
organic chemistry, and the injured 
researcher was conducting an ex-
periment with Brevetoxin A at the 
time ofthe accident. Brevetoxin, a 
chemical which is capable of kill-
ing fish, is found in the oceanic 
algae blossoms commonly called 
"red tides." 

"These incidents are extremely 
rare," said Goldsmith, who is not 
willing to speculate on the cause of 
the accident until an investigation 
by Scripps health and safety offi-
cials is complete.

Poetic Justice 
Comes to S.D. 

Do you want to know what 
poetic justice is? It's not 
watching that jerk who cut you 
off get pulled over by a cop, as 
you drive by waving. It's not 
seeing David Hasselhoff sing 
victoriously among those low-
life L.A. cynics on the Tonight 
Show last week. 

Tritons Kick SDSU's Aztec 

No, poetic justice was what 
happened at that gargantuan 
RIMAC Arena last night. 
There played our noble male 
volleyballers, dwarfed by the 
very building they play in and 
dwarfed even more by the 
continual line of Division I 
talent they race every night. 

Stanford, UC Berkeley, 
. UCLA, Long Beach State, 

BYU, USC, Pepperdine. 
Hawaii ... the role call of 
scholarship superstars came in 
and pummeled our helpless 
Division III heroes into the 
shiny, wooden floor. 

There were lots of tough 
days for our firm Triton 
athletes. Game in and game 
'Out, the UCSD men's 
volley bailers listened to the 
bell, took out their notebooks, 
and got thoroughly schooled. 
Aside from a few bright spots 
here and there - a dash of 
Tyson Kerr and a pinch of Tom 
Black - UCSD routinely got 
beat. And beat again. 

Every painful moment and 
every blistering opponent's 
spike beat down upon the 
youthful Triton squad. When it 
came to crunch time, UCSD 
simply got crunched. 

But that's when that 01' 
catchphrase "poetic justice" 
came to town - this, along 
with the arrogant. mindless, 
iIIegall y paid, bogus degree-
carrying San Diego State 
Aztecs. Here's where poetic 
justice came to be played out 
on the freshly built RIMAC 
floor. Here's where a bunch of 
athletic students came together 
to defeat a bunch of athletes 
from a cross-town arch-rival. 

Poetic justice was Tom 
Black's 34 kills. Poetic justice 
was Tyson Kerr, Triton Player-
of-the-Millenium, closing out 
his historic career with a large 
'W' on the scores heel. Poetic 
justice was two-sport star Malt 
Minehan stepping up and 
coming into his own. 

Poetic justice was the Daily 
Aztec running an illy-billy 
blurb of a story - hardly 
larger than the size of the nail 
on my pinky finger- into the 
farthest depths of the paper 

UPSET: UCSD broke a long 
draught in its season finale, 
defeating SDSU in five sets 
By Jeremy Melamed 
Staff Writer 

It was a storybook ending to a season on the 
brink of major disappointment. With only one 
victory all season, no wins in Mountain Pacific 

Sports Federation competition and 
only one game left to play, the 
UCSD men's volleyball team faced 
the real ity of a second straight year 
without a league ·W.' 

That is, until last night. 
The Tritons, now in their second 

season of the Doug Dannevik head 
coaching regime, have played some 

of their best volleyball in recent years this sea-
son - but they have repeatedly come up short 
against the top teams in the nation. 

The stage was set: On Tuesday night, UCSD's 
cross-town rival, 14th-ranked San Diego State, 
came to RlMAC for the final malch of the sea-
son. It would be the last time Triton fans would 
get to see the greatest volleyball player in UCSD 
history, Tyson Kerr. The Tritons' all-lime kill 
leader and a four-year starter, he is the only se-
nior on the young squad. His coaches and team-
mates wanted nothing more than to send him out 
as a winner. They wanted nothing more than to 
avoid tarnishing his amazing career by chalking 
up yet another winless season. 

And after battling with SDSU for over three 
solid hours, UCSD got its wish. The Tritons' hard 
work paid off and they emerged victorious, serap-
ing through the final game and pulling off the 
upset victory, 15-5,15-10,14-16,12-15,15-6. 

The Tri~ons (2-21) were riding an emotional 
high as the game began, playing in front of their 
largest audience of the season at home. The fired-
up UCSD volleyballers came out of the locker 
room and blew the Aztecs (6-14) off the court in 
the opening game of the contest. With Kerr lead-
ing the way, the Tritons stormed out to a one-
game lead. 

The team's momentumllluried over into game 
two, and the intensity levels on both sides began 
to pick up. Up 10-9 in game two, holding on Ie .. 
one-game lead and playing extremely well. it 
looked like the Tritons could do no wrong.

But as quick as a blazing Triton spike, the 
situation took a sharp tum for the worse. UCSD's 
team leader, Kerr - who had slammed down 14 

kills through the first two 
games so far - went down 
with an anlde injury and did 
not return to action. Without 
their general. the Triton army 
still managed to pull out the 
victory in game two. 

"We dominated as a team in 
the first two games," Danne-
vik said. "Dan Thomason 
hadn't played in the middle for 
a month, but he did a great job 
fi iii ng in for Tyson." 

Aztecs took advantage of Kerr's absence and 
stole game three from under the Tritons' noses. 

Game four was a see-saw affair most of the 
way. but UCSD was plagued by poor serving late 
in the game. State cranked out the win to even 
the match at two games apiece. 

Game five, played under rally sconng (where

41 The UCSD cy-clins team bauled 30 mph winds, hilly ter-rain and a monstrous 
2OO-entrant field at the 

Stanford University road race on 
April 15·16. 

However, despite all the ob-
stacles, the Triton cyclists still 
managed to chalk up some excep-
tional performances in the 12-
school meet. Racing over closed-
off roads near Altemon Pass in . 
Livermore, CA, UCSD's athletes 
made the best of Saturday 's open 
road race. 

In Sunday's triple time-trial 
race, UCSD didn't fare quite as 
well. Under time-trial rules, each 
team must enter four athletes in 
the event Disc wheels and Arrow 
equipment are used as the team 
members sprint over the seven-
mile course in a pack. 

The Tritons' best finish was in 
the Men's B division, where their 
shortened team of three racers 
grabbed fourth place. 

UC Berkeley took top honors 
overall for both days of the com-
petition.

Some of the 

notable efforts

UCSD CLUB SPORTS 
ROUND-UP 

Women 's Lacrosse 

.,. 

. With two games re-
• maining to play this week-

end, the UCSD women's la· 
crosse squad (5-2) is battling 

for playoff position. After a pair 
of tough defeats on March 11 and 12, 
UCSD has set its sights on the sec-
ond seeding in the Southern Califor-
nia Women's Lacrosse Association 
(SCWLA) playoffs which began on 
April 29. 

On Saturday, March II, perennial 
power UC Santa Barbara rolled into 
town to challenge the red-hot San 
Diego squad which held a perfect 5-
o mark. The intensely fought game 
resulted in a 12-9 victory for UCSD's 
foes from up north, and the Tritons' 
first defeat. But, the loss was far from 
heartbreaking. 

"It was a really good game," at-
tacker Lac Nguyen said. "Everyone 
played well. If we'd just picked it up 
a little more in the first half, I think 
we could have at least gotten a tie." 

The next day, UCSD's stick wield-
ing women welcomed UC Irvine to 
Pryatel and were upset by the pesky 
Anteaters, 13-8. It was an uncharac-
teristic loss for a team used to win-
ning handily against all but Ihe tough-
est of opponents. 

Nguyen said. 
The losses came amidst the 

rumblings of change at the helm. 
For a few weeks prior to the game, 
the Tritons had been largely self-
coached following the loss of 
Connie Baker, who started the sea-
son as the coach. However, just 
recently, Sandy Walker took over 
the coaching reins and has instilled 
a new attitude in the UCSD squad. 

"Sandy has been reshaping the 
team," Nguyen said. "She has 
brought so much enthusiasm and 
done so much for the morale of the 
team. It is incredible." 

That morale and the new game 

plans being put into the Tritons' 
system will be crucial for their 
playoff hopes when they take on 
Whittier and the University of 
Arizona this weekend. Both 
games are league contests and 
are critical to UCSD's playoff 
destiny. 

Sunday's game will be held 
at Pryatel Field in Warren at 1 
p.m. and the Tritons would like 
nothing better than to pick up a 
victory against the Wildcats to 
increase their chances of return-
ing home to host the playoffs in 
two weeks. 

"We were with them, and then 
they got a couple of quick goals and 
used that momentum against us," Uehetta Manzone (left) raced by UCSB, but UCSD fell, 12-9.

ueSD Steals Third 
CAIN FIS: Walter fills in for Uberuaga, and the 
Tritons grab third-place at Point Lorna tourney 
IIJ Tedd UcId 
Sports Editor 

It's been a tough week for Tri-
ton golfer Greg Uberuaga. One day 
after winning a playoff over Brian 

with style, Alex Behrend took up the 
Triton team reins. With co-captain 
Tom Brown out because of another 
school-related conflict - this time, 
delivering a five-minute speech to 
his class - Behrend delivered, 
shooting an exceptional 78-75 total. 

Walter for the final 
team spot, Uberuaga 
had his car stolen. And 
with it, went his clubs 
and his UCSD-
mongrammed balls. 

Arnie Campbell was his usual 
steady self, grabbing the second 
team scoring slot for UCSD. He .. 
notched an amazing 76-stroke tally 

"I think he was in the first round, before slipping to 
more upset about the 

clubs and the balls than the car," 
Triton Head Coach Mike Wydra 
said. "Well, wouldn't you be?" 

a sub-par 79 in the second. 
The third Triton golfer to place 

was Pete Roberts, who had a disap-
pointing first-round total of SO. He 
recovered, however, stroking a 
lowly 77 in the second round. 

Nonetheless, Walter filled in ad-
mirably for the club-less Uberuaga, 
and the UCSD golf team went on to 
take third-place overall yesterday at 
the Point lorna 

Up-and-coming Jeremy Byrd

Dayton, OH-based band uided By Voices 
finds inspiration in '60s British rock 

By Jeff Niesel, Hiatus Ed ito r 
t might seem odd for an American indie rock 
band to be citing The Seatles and The Who as 
its main influences, but for Guided by Voices 
guitarist Tobin Sprout, most music just doesn't 
compare with early British rock. 

"I love The Who and The Beades, of course, 
and just that '60s and '7& sound, The 

vocals, the melodies and songwriting were much 
stronger then," 
Sprout said during a recent phone interview_ "I think 
some of our stuff is mud! harder," 

Guided by Voices bas bloomed late in its career. 
The band was formed in 1986 and 

quiddyreleascdfivealbums 
on independent records. 

At that time, however, 
few listeners were 
paying attention to 
the Dayton, OH-
based band. All 
that changed 

when the group re-
leased Bee Thousand 

in 1994_ In fact, the band bas gained so much notoriety 
on the indie cirwit, its first four LPs were re-released 
in a box set earlier this year_ Part of the bU72 concern-
ing the band bas to do with the Iow-fi trend in music 
- a style of music characterized by minimalist re-
cordings 011 primitive four-tnck equipment, but Sprout 
said the band didn't set out to be part of any trend 

"We weren't trying to be low-fi, "he said "We tried 
to get the best sound we could on the four-track stuff 
we were doing. For so long we were putting out our 
ownaJbumsandthehigbqualitywasn'tthatimportant 
to us, but then it started coming out in large markets 
with Sebadoh and other people lumped in the scene. 
It's pretty much beside the point. Now I get tapes from 
people who are trying to impress me with how low-fi 
they can gel. I think maybe we've created a monster." 

Guided by Voices has consistently been prolific, 
having released a number of seven-inches on indepen-
dent labels. Sprout said the band intends to scale back 
the number of albums it releases, but the group just 
released Alien Lanes and has another album due out 
soon. 

"The next album will be out in October and Bob 
[poUard] will do a solo album. We've got some other 
songs we're working <5n for the next 
album, so we're ahead of schedule 
right now, but I think we have 
rut back," Sprout said. "Af-
ter Vampire on Titus, we 
putout three 7-inPtes, and 
then we started realizing 
we were putting too much

Irish hero 
defonds his hooor 
. . . £n sweep£ng epze 

By Chl.un Simmons 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Guardian 

Movies based on European his-
lory have traditionally not been block-
busters, but ~ Roy, asweeping saga 
set in the Scottish highlands, could be 
the first. Based on the true Slory of 
Robert Roy MacGregor (Liam 
Neeson), Rob Roy has all the elements 
that spell box-()ffice success: a tal-
ented cast, wonderful plot, stunning 
visuals and' plenty of romance. 

Robert Roy MIICGrqor (LbIm Neeson) rides with 
of AJvI (Andrew K .... ) to ,.. his final battle. 

MacGregor, better known as Rob 
Roy, is head of the MacGregor Clan, 
which lives and works on the 
property of the evil Marquis 
of Montrose (John Hurt). In 
an attempt 10 alleviate the 
poverty of his clan, Rob bor-
rows one thousand Scottish 
pounds from Montroseto buy 

.. and sell cattle for profit. 
The money disappears 

with Rob's friend McDonald (Eric 
Stoltz), and Rob is held accountable 
for the debt and interest. Unable to 

pay and unwillingto dishonor himself 
by lying against another lord, Rob 
flees to save his family. Led by the 
Marquis' swordsman Cunningham 
(rim Roth), the Marquis' men bru-
tally evict Rob's wife (Jessica Lange) 
and children. Rob then begins his 

crusade against the tyranny 
of the Marquis. 

Roth, last seen as the un-
fortunate crook who holds 
up the wrong cotJeeshop in 
Pulp Fiction, gives an excel-
lent performance as the ef-
feminate and coldhearted 
hired sword. Roth brilliantly 

portrays the startling contrasts of 
Cunningham, a lecherous character 
made more hateful by his cruel wit.

Academy Award-nominee Neeson 
(Schindler's List and Nell) is in his 
natural element playing Rob, a man 
who personifies dignity, value and 
honor. The role seems as tailor-made 
for him as the kilts which he wore for 
the movie. 

Oscar-winner Lange once again 
shows her versatility and skill with 
her brilliant performance as Rob's 
wife, Mary MacGregor. The vulner-
abi I ity and strength of the Scottish 
heroine comes through with clarity. 

Rob Roy is a beautifully crafted 
movie with a winning storyline and 
wonderful cinematography. It has 
passion, intrigue, swash-buckling 
sword fights and one of the best vil-
lains in recent movie history.

may haveopled for a folk-inflected 
sound on Will-
ing to Wait, the 
follow-uptoher 
1993 debut 
Massive Blur, 
but the Boston-
born singer still 
plays with in-
tensity. 

Ferrick first 
came to the attention of Morrissey 
when she opened for him when he 
played Madison Square Garden in 
1992. Morrissey was so impressed 
with her performance he let heropen 
more dates. Since then, Ferrick has 
opened forformer Replacement Paul 
Westerberg, John Hiatt and country 
singer Dwight Yoakam. 

Whether searching for identity 
("I Am Not"), contemplating a bro-
kenrelationship("When You Left") 
or empathizing with an abused lover 
("Willing to Wait"), Ferrick sings 
with integrity and determination. 

Although Willing is mostly 
acoustic, Ferrick hasn't completely

abandoned her rock inclinations. In 
tracks like "Falling on Fists" and "I 
Am Done," she plays with enough 
energy to merit comparisons to 

~elissa Etheridge. 
Like local singer Jewel, 

Ferrick's vocals sometimes sound 
more mature than her material. 
But compared with the material on 
herfirst album, Ferrick shows con-
tinuing signs of maturity. She 
wrestles with questions of romance 
with a increasing sense of self-
awareness and may just be the 
next Melissa Etheridge.

Mudhoney 
My Brother the 

Cow 
......... 11 ... 

Mudhoney has been clumped to-
gether with Pearl Jam and Nirvana 
under the grunge classification ever 
since the music and fashion industries 
targeted the Pacific Northwest as the 
trendiest spot in the country. None of 
these bands has coped with sudden 
fame gracefully. Pearl Jam's Eddie 
Vedder engaged in a long struggle 
with Ticketmaster, the corporate pow-
erhouse which monopolizes concert 
prices nationwide. Nirvana's Kurt 
Cobain committed suicide just over a 
year ago, leaving behind his wife 
Courtney Love and their small daugh-
ter. And, judging from the lyrics of 
Mudhoney's latest release, My Brother 
the Cow, this band is feeling pretty 
bitter about male American rock star-
dom too. 

In "Generation Spokesmodel" 
Mudhoney parodies the way audiences 
deify moralJy bankrupt musicians with 
superficial talents: "I'm the spokes-
man for your generation, I lose my 
shirt for revelation./Thanks to the kids 
for making me who I am ... 20 percent 
of the gross goes straight to me." An-
other song, "Into Yer Shtik," is a per-
ceptive, hostile take on the way rock 
stars become c:orwumed by the self-
destructive decadence so prevalent in 
the music business: "Stands at the bar 

VOICES:Band 
plays short songs 
ContInued from pc. H1 
stuff out. " 

Perhaps one of the most frustrat-
ing qualities of Guided by Voices' 
music is that its songs are so short. 

The UCSD Guardian

with bandaged hands, they tried to dry 
him out and he got mad.! Cut his fist 
punching hospital glass, made his 
myth, now he's trapped." 

Unlike other successful Seattle 
bands, Mudhoney hasn't enjoyed regu-
lar air-time on mainstream, self-pro-
claimed alternative radio stations. One 
reason for this may be that there is no 
trace of pop-melody appeal in its vo-
cals or instrumentals - Mudhoney's 
punk influences are raw, not bubbly. 
Dissonant chords and heavy drums 
blend to create a metallic blues sound. 

Mark Arm's dark lyrics about ~-.: 
sire, grief and rage are engaging, and 
even haunting at timeS. -In My Finest 
Suit" is about love and the terror of 

Catchy pop hooks often come to an 
abrupt end in under two minutes. 

"The sonp could go on longer, but 
it's just the way we've been writing 
for awhile. On the next album, there 
are lots of four-minute songs. We 
took a )jttle more time while record-
ing," Sprout said. 

Guided by Voices wiu perform 

loss, reminiscent of "Broken Hands" 
which appeared on the band's 1991 
release, Every Good Boy Deserves 

. Fudge. "Fearless Doctor Killers" ad-
dresses the hypocrisy of the religious 
right: "I'mall for life until the bastard's 
born, after that he's on his own./ And 
if he does crime trying to survive I'll 
make damn sure he's electrified." 

But underneath the exterior of ag-
grasive disgust with images of social 
corruption, the album reflects a long-
ing for sornething better. The last song 
on the album, "1995," challenges us to 
look critically at this far-from-perfed 
culture and to abandon apathetic com-
placence. 

with Smile, Down by Law, Blink, No 
Doubt and Mary Lou Lord as part of

ooncert starts at 12:30 p.m. UCSD

White Zombie 
Astro Creep: 2000 

A few years back in the crypt 
definitely hasn't mellowed the group 
White Zombie. The band's sopho-
more effort is played in a higher gear 
which is closer to industrial than 
rock. This incessant, fast-paced as-
sault on the eardrums 
shows little regard for 
rhythm change. 

The band's drummer, 
John Tempesta, seems like 
little morethanadrum ma-
chine stuck on rapid-fire, 
while guitarist" J" provides 
generic power riffs that of-
ten seem recycled from the 
group's first album. Sean YsevJt's 
bass is lost in aU the murk. 

Lead singer Rob Zombie indulges 
in his usual psychotic, post-apoca-
lyptic lyrics which fade in and out of 
the mix. 

Songs such as "Electric Head Pt. 

2 (the ecstasy)" sound like straight 
rip-offs from La Sexorsisto, the 
band's first album, and Zombie's 
mysterious Iyricssucb as "Jesus lived 
his life in a cheap hoteVon the edge 
of Route 66/ yeah/ be lived a dark 

and twisted life" quickly be-
come as cliched as the innu-
merablesnippetsofB-movie 
dialogue littering the album. 

One of the few bright 
spots on Astro Creep is 
"More Human Than Hu-
man." 

However, lyrics such as 
"I am the Nexus one/ I want 

more life fucker/ I ain't done" are not 
only lifted from the movie 
Bladerunner, but also have no con-
nection to the music other than the 
fact that both are angry and antago-
nizing.

Once Were Warriors Soundtrack 

Lee Tamahori'sfilm Once Were 
Wa"Wrs is a grim drama about a 
native Maori family struggling to 
make ends meet in New Zcaland. 
Yet you wouldn't know the movie 
has such a bleak theme from its 
soundtrack. With the exception of 
guitaristTama Renata's eerie theme 
music, the mood of the songs is 
celebratory, expressed in a variety 
of musical styles ranging from hom-
driven reggae (South of Bombay's 
New Zealand hit, "What's the Time 
Mr. Wolf?"), rap (Gifted & Brown's 

"So Much Soul-) and R&B 
(Ardijah's "Gim'me Timej. 

Dance tracks such as Merenia's 
"U Know (I Ukc It' and Maree 
Sheehan's '"1'0 Be Free (Kia Tu 
Mahea)" could light up the dance

range of music represented here 
shows that New Zealand, known 
mostly for producing pop acts such 
as the OIiDs, Straightjacket Fits and 
Crowded House, has. diverse scene 
waiting to be discovered.
