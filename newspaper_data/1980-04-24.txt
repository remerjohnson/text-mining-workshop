Campus reac tion yesterday to 
Tuesday's H ouse of Representa tives 
approval of fund for selective s rvice 
registration was swift, but nonviolent 
and small scale . 

A Revell Plaza rally drew 90 
tudents listening to several members 

of the San Diego Students for Pace 
weigh in again t the draft. About 50 of 
those students then walked to the 
Revelle Po t off ice a nd stayed ther 
until 2 pm, itting.in and writing I tters 
to Senators who will vo te next on th 
registration funds. 

The 0 cupation of the office was 
peaceful and lasted about two h "our . 

Campus police stood by, but said 
they would only intervene if f dera l 
mails were disrupt d , and no police 
photographers were pr ~nt , unlike 
past ra llies. 

"W ·already h. v "phn os of all of 
them," one campu pol iceman 
explained. 

The peaker on the plaza tarted 
with less than 50 people nd grew to 
90 a lh y criticiz d th Hous and 
Pr sidenl Carter for theIr upporl of 
registra tion. 

" It's important that we send th 
Senate, the country and the world a 
message that no one will be drafted to 
maintain our gluttenoul> hfe '1tyle," an 
SDSP leader said.

UC Can't Go It Alone 
On Tuition: ePEC 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
Sacramento Correspondent 

A unilateral decision to 
impose tuition by anyone of 
the three slate pu bl ic 
institutions of higher education 
could undermin attempt to 
supp ly ea sily assessib le

Post.Seco ndary Edu cation

CPEC director Pat Callen 
said a University of California 
decision to impose tuition in 
the event Proposition 9 pas es 
in June could force UC 
students into the slate or 
community college syste'm. 

These tran 'ferrals, Callen 
predicted, might overload the 
other two systems at a time 
when the state could not 
provide additional resources to

"This is nol an issue where 

we can say 'ever. segment for

relationships have to be looked 
a t closely' and any kind of 
unila teral action, Sl1 h alt th 
universi ty is onsidering, 
ne ds to be discouraged." 

Callen said the number of 
students using price as a 
criterion in choosing which 
system th y will attend hould 
be minim ized and h e 
emphasized the importance of 
accurately predi c ting

"The re's neve r been registration

After five minutes of chanting "no 
war," a third of H rally particip n 
marched th fe yard to the post

office worker Jean Miles. 

Miles, who h d never seen an 
occupation of her office in five previous 
years of work , thought the it·in wa

No more than thirty d mon!>trator

Print Platform, Not Social Life 
Editor: 

In summarizing the 
lengthy interview held with 
AS presidential candidate 
Kathleen Shanahan (Guard. 
ion April 21st), certain issues 
of primary importance in her 
campaign were downplayed 
in order to accentuate her 
sorority involvement. By 
placing such a major 
emphasis on a topic covered 
only briefly in her interview, a 
serious injustice was done to 
her College Priority platform. 
I would like to bring 
Kathleen's stand on key 
campaign issues back into 
their proper perspectives. 

As your article stated, 

Kathleen has been an active 
member of a UCSD sorority. 
However, the articl~ went 
into Weat depth in prelientin~ 
Kathleen as a "sorority girl ' 
as if that were the primary 
focus of her campaign. 
Nowhere in the article was 
there any mention of her 
equally dedicated and 
responsible work as a 
Resident Advisor, Orienta· 
tion Leader, Revelle CoUege 
Council Member, or any of 
the numerous other positions 
through which she has 
demonstrated her excellent 
leadership capabilities. I 
have seen her working 
diligently all year all an AS 

Council Representative to 
solicit . the views of the 
students she was elected to 
serve and to see that their 
voices are heard, a difficult 
and time.consuming task, 
given the current workings of 
this year's self·centered AS. 
Kathleen 's record speaks for 
itself. 

Our unique system of 
student government, 
patterned around our college 
system theoretically offers 
UCSD students a voice in 
issues at both the college and 
campus.wide levels. Yet the 
c1osed·minded autonomy of 
the AS in the past has left the 
four college governments 

without the necessary 
channels through which their 
voices can be heard. As AS 
President, Kathleen 
Shanahan promises to 
establish a student 
government network linking 
the Revelle, Muir, Third , and 
Warren coUege governments 
together with the AS so that 
all can work efficiently 
together to meet the needs of 
UCSD students. The "Fifth 
College" entity under which 
the AS currently operates 
can be effectively eliminated 
and replaced by an AS 
dedicated to serving our four 
colleges. Such a promise can

the students have very little 
understanding of what the 
AS is or what it doell. They 
view the AS officers as

we are the only candidates

On Friday, April 11 , the 

Revelle College Council 
voted not to endorse anyone 
candidate or slate for any of 
the ASUCSD positions. 
However, individually the 
council members were 
allowed to endorse 
candidates. 

After hearing many of the 
candidates speak about their 
platforms and after reading 

literature presented by the 
candidates, I endorse the 
slate of Shanahan, 
Breslauer, and Semerdjian. 

The basis of UCSD is its 
unique college system: four 
colleges with four equally 
important views on 
education. This college 
system must be upheld. 

The College Priority slate 
will help by bringing "the AS 
to where the students are the 

AS" and by opening the 
c ommuni cation lines 
between the four colleges 
through such means as an 
effective Quad Council. 
Another way will be to 
increase the retention and 
recruitment therefore 
creating a college system 
where students enjoy 
attending, not one where 
they consider it a struggle.

NRC Investigates 
Safety Negligence 

SAN ONOFRE - The 
Nuclear Regulatory Commis· 
sion sent new investigators to 
the San Onofre nuclear plant 
yesterday to look into an 
electrician's claims of sloppy 
practices by workers. 
. A dozen men were 
contaminated by radioactive 
dust while repairing a leaking 
generator at the electric plant 
April 22 . 

The electrician, identified as 
Michael Flanagan, 31, said he 
believes he saw eight instances 
of safety negligence last week. 

He said workmen smoked 
and drunk water in 
inauthorized areas, failed to 
use Geiger counters as 
required and improperly took 
off their protective gear. 

Flanagan said three 
workers stepped over a rope 
marking a containment area, 
apparently to save time. And 
he said materials contami· 
nated by dangerous radiation 
were allowed outside the rope 
perimeter. 

"I am a proponent of 
nuclear power if it is 
administered right, if proper 
procedures are followed and if 
every single person follows the 
procedures," Flanagan said 
Tuesday. 

Lew Miller, NRC safety 
representative at San Onofre, 
said he made a list of 
infractions alleged by 
Flanagan. 

No copy of the list was given 
to Southern California Edison 
Co., the plant's operator and 
principal owner, a company 
spokesman said, promising 
"anyone seen breaking 
regulations would be 
reprimanded immediately." 

Another Edison spokesman 
said earlier that two minor 
safety problems were noted by 
government investigators 
looking into the April 12 
incident.

Killanin Offers

LUSANNE, Switzerland 
- Lord Killanin, president of 
the International Olympic 
Committee, offered last night 
to meet personally with Jimmy 
Carter and Leonoid Brezhnev 
in a bid to save Moscow's 
crumbling Summer Olympic 
Games. 

As most western European 
countries appeared set to 
follow President Carter's call 
for a boycoll, the executive 
board of the IOC ended three 
days of talks on the crisis. 

Killanin said he received a 
long letter from Brezhnev 
some time ago, and Tuesday 
night Carter sent him a Telex 
message expressing faith in 
the value of the Olympic 
movement.

McCarty said that Brown, 
"despite his current low

AS Council Finally Nantes 
Its Muir Representative 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Slaff Writer 

The AS Council finally triumphed in its seige 
with Muir College last night, approving Nyla 
Marson, the product of the "legitimate interview 
process" the AS has demanded for two weeks, 
as the new Muir Representative to the AS. 

The AS Council's enforced delay narrowed 
the field of applicants for the position to one ~ 
Marson - who, eleven council members voting 
for her appointment noted, had been 
"interviewed" for the job. 

Fred Nagel, the Muir College Council's 
unanimous choice for the position, was denied 
approval by the AS at the past two Council 
meetings, since an interview process was not 
originally employed. 

Due to what MCC Chairwoman Rosemary 
Grobarek calls "totally inappropriate treatment" 
of Nagel by the AS, he resigned from the MCC 
appointment last week with a "disillusioned 
heart." 

The MCC, attempting to "patch things up 
between the AS," complied to the Council's 
wishes that an interview process be used to 
select the representative. Grobarek refused to ' 
r.articipate in the interviews which she was 
'morally against." 

" I'm glad the MCC went ahead and held 
interviews without my approval," admitted 
Grobarek. "I think it disproves the common 
notion that the MCC is a single leader entity." 

The effectiveness of the interview process was 
negated, however, when all other candidates for 
the position withdrew their applications and only 
Marson remained. 

" I see this girl as basically the survivor of a 
process I stiD feel was illegitimate," said Jon 
Bekken, the only council member who voted 
against her appointment. "I urge the Council to 
once again reject this person," he concluded . 

Marson herself felt the "whole thing was 
really stupid" and nearly withdrew her 

application. "I agreed with the AS when they 
condemned Muir for not having interviews and I 
think this has made Muir College look really 
bad," said Marson, who thought it would be 
"fun" to be on the AS. 

.Grobarek, however , feels the AS is at fault, 
and labeled the AS refusal to approve Nagel as 
"thoroughly wrong and non.supportive of a 
mutually important relationship' between the 
AS and the colleges. 

Nagel expressed considerable disgust with the 
AS last night when he said, "This is UCSD 
attrition at work. If they hassle over every piece 
of business the way they did over me, then I see 
why they don't ever get anything done." 

In other AS business, the Council: 
- heard Student Center Board member 

Dave Phelps outline a proposal to investigate 
the possibility 01 establishing an emergency 
paramedic service on campus. Stemming from 
the recent death 01 Alan Howard in a Revelle 
dormitory, the proposal is one Phelps feels is 
"way overdue. UCSB and UCD both have 
complete fire and paramedic services right on 
campus. Unfortunately, it took a tragic incident 
for UCSD to realize the need for such a service;" 

- moved to "strongly urge Career Planning 
and Placement not to invite military and military

Patients Kept Too Long: Bills High 
Releasing Heart Attack Candidates Earlier Could Save 26% 

BOSTON Nearly half the people 
held in intensive care for possible heart 
attacks can safely be released a day 
earlier than usual, a move that could 
cut their hospital bills by an average 26 
percent, a study shows. 

Hospitals spend as much as 20 
percent of their budgets on intensive 
care, and cutting the service could 
mean substantial savings for them as 
well. 

People with chest pains are routinely 
put in intensive care until doctors figure 
out whether they really have had heart 
attacks. These people make up 39 
percent of all admissions to intensive 
care units , the most expensive ward in 
a hospital. 

Researche rs at Massachusetts 
General Hospital have found a few 
simple tests can quickly weed out 
healthy people so they can be 
discharged from intensive care within a 
day. Currently, these low-risk patients 
stay in intensive care an a verage of two 
days. 

If hospitals followed their guidelines, 

the doctors estimate it would reduce the 
number of intensive care beds reserved 
for heart patients by 9 percent. 

Two studies on the use of intensive 
care units, directed by physicians 
Albert G. Mulley and George E. 
Tibault, were published in Thursday's 
issue of the New England Journal of 
Medicine. 

The cost of staying in intensive care 
is often two or three times that of a 
private room. At Massachusetts 
General , intensive care costs an 
average of $2,000 for patients 
admitted for chest pains who are later 
given clean bills of health. 

Intensive care units came into vogue 
in the early 1960s . They provide 
sophisticated monitoring and life-
saving equipment and are staffed by 
specially trained nurses . At first, they 
were reserved for victims of serious 
heart disease, but later they were 
expanded to provide care for other 
critically ill people. 

wrote, "We are by now investing such 
vast resources in intensive care ... We 
are in urgent need of something to tell 
us who needs to be in the ICU and for 
how long." 

The Boston doctors reviewed 2,693 
patients admitted to an intensive care 
unit over two years . 

They found 47 percent of the people 
in intensive care for chest pains had 
normal blood tests and electrocardio· 
grams and were free of major 
complications within a day 01 
admission. Since only 6 perc~nt of this 
group had serious problems after the 
first day, the researchers concluded 
they could be moved to ordinary 
hospital rooms until doctors were sure 
they were well enough to go home. 

The doctors found most people are 
sent to intensive care so their 
conditions can be monitored. Only one 
in 10 actually needs the specialized 

.care for which the units were intended, 
the researcers reported.

Sewage in Mission Bay 
Hanns HUDlans, Not Fish 

Waste Flow Expected to End Soon 
BY PETER MORTENSEN 

Science Edit ... 
Although 8 to 10 million 

gallons of raw sewage 
continue to Row into Mission 
Bay each day, local biologists 
and public health officials say 
they doubt any irreversible 
damage has been done to the 
underwater inhabitants of the 

bar.Crewl will be finished 
repairing the line anywhere 
between this weekend and 
next weekend, and at that 
point, all the sewage will be 
back in the line," lays John 
Melbourn , a San Diego 
County public health engineer. 

"There'. an outhouse up at 
San Diego State that 's 

discharging about eight million 
gallons a day into the (San 
Diego) river," he jokes. The 
San Diego River carries the 
sewage into the bay, and tides 
and currents carry the liquid 
waste throughout that area 
and up and down the coast for 
a short way. 

Crews . have completely 
repaired the sewage pipe, 
which was broken in numerous 
places by torrential rains 
which hit the area six weeks 
ago. However, boulders that 
slipped into the line's breaks 
still remain, and city and 
county workers are attempting 
to remove the blockage so 
sewage can run without 
spillage. 

Even though the sewage 
continues to flow , a San Diego 
biologist doubts that any 
imbalan e in the bay's delicate 
life cycle has been 
permanently created. 

"The sewage is comprised 
mainly of fresh water and 
secondarily of hous ehold 

wa~tes . The fresh water itself is 
probably as bad as any of the 
rest of the stuff," says John 
Duffy, a scientist with the 
California Fish and game 
office here. 

" Most of the free swimming 
fish that are going to be 
adversely a ffected by the 
sewage will simply swim out of 
it," he says. He listed sport fish 
such as anchovies, mackarel ,

Grants Seeks Pre-Meds with Minds of Their Own 
- ---------------------

Communication With Advisers, Applicants Should Spread Word of Med School's New Emphasis 
A grant intended to improve 

the quality of communications 
between the UCSD School of 
Med icine and premedical 
education advisors has been 
awarded to the school by the 
Jesiah Macy, Jr. Foundation . 

The $19,400 grant will give 
advisors and universit y 
undergradu a tes a better 
opportunity to assess UCSD's 
admission standards and 
educational standards. 

Until last year , the biology 
prerequisites lor admission to 
the school were among the 
most rigorous of all US 
medical schools. The school's 
faculty however, recently 
approved a sig nifi cant 
reduction in those require· 
ments, though trying to insure 
that the overall quality of 
applicants would remain high. 

As part of the program for 
better applicant relations, the 
school has announced that it is 
now seeking students who 
majored in areas of personal 
interest, rather than the 
standard " premed" under· 
graduate degree. This policy is 
in line with the goals of th 
Macy Foundation whose goal 
it is to "reduce the competitive 
behavior, academic narrow· 
ness, ocial isolation and 
grade conscious ne~ of 
premedical students." 

Spooner b lieves, as does 
the fac ulty of the school, that a 
strict sci nee background is 
unbalanced, and he upports 
the concept of the Foundation 

that students more broadly 
educated in the humanities are 
better prepared lor th multiple 
roles of the modern physicia n. 

Initially, th grant will b 
used to improve the 
informat ion exchange 
between UCSD and pr medi · 
cal advisorl> at undergraduate 
institutions throughout 
California, since a majority of 
applicants here are state 
residents, and over half of the 
students who are currently 
enrolled graduated from 
California universities. 

UCSD will work dosely 
with premedical advisors in 
formulating mechanisms for 
feedback from medical 
students regarding their 
undergraduate preparation for 
medicine wilh recommenda· 
tions for future advising and 
course selection for 
premedical students . 

During an orientation 
program at the Asilemar 
Conference in Paci fic Crove, 
California, this month, the 
Western Association of 
Advisors of Health Profes· 
sions and admi~sions 
representatives from th e 
UCSD School of Medicine will 
discuss the chool's revised 
entrance requirements. 
Spooner hopes thi s will ease 
concern a t UCSD that many 
qualified students may not be 
aware of the new admissions 
policy . 

The grant will also enable 
the school to study the

Most people associate cockroach

Homeowners must treat the crannies that 
harbor cockroaches rather than exposed 
areas, he says. Likely harborage spots are 
stacked· up newspapers, empty grocery sacks, 
corrugated cardboard, the spaces between 
walls and cabinetry, (especially under the 
kitchen sink), spaces behind the stove and 
refrigerator, th groove above and below 
hinges of cabinets and doors, and gaps around

The powd r is toxic to humans, so it should be 
handled carefully, kept oul of the reach of 
children and stored in a place where it will not 
be confused with food.

"knockdown" effect but takes effect over 7 to

the midnight movie hal

in theater. acrollllthe country. 
1he new. has reached the ears 
01 University Towne Centre 6 
Theatres manager John 
fJlilOn, who decided not long 
880 that San Die~o ,hould be 
included in the phenomenon. 

The result is Midnight Movie 
Magic, a four month long film 
series produced in conjuction 
with FM radion station Magic 
91. 

"There has been a 
!elurgen~e or ~ surgence of 
Interest In movie, shown at 
midnight," stated Ellison. "We 
have found that young people 
come out at midnight and, 

depending upon the film, older 
pe<>ple as well." 

The series, which made its 
debut this year on March 28, 
is the first of its kind to be 
offered at a commercial movie 
theater (The Fine Arts 
Theater also runs a midnight 
program which is co-
sponsored by radio station 
KPRI FM 106). The feature 

films are selected on the basis 
of research gathered by Ellison 
and his personnel on 
nationwide midnight movie 
showings. 

"Plus, feedback from our 
own viewers indicate to us 
what they like to see," he 
added. 

Diverse best describes the 
cinematic choices for Midnight 
Movie Magic. Nocturnal 
audiences can look forward to 
seeing such films as Pink 
Floyd, a rock music 
experience that, according to 
Ellison, "people love to see 
over and over againj" 
Wizards, an animated 
endeavor of a world ruled by 
magic and technology; the 
original versions of Dracula 
and Frankenstein, considered 
by the theater manager to be 
"the true beginnings of horror 
film: Help!, The Beatles' 
masterful follow.up to A Hard 
Day's Night; and Blazing 
Saddles, Mel Brooks ' 
perennial spoof of the Old 
Wesl. 

"Nobody has done this 
previously in a midnight movie 
format ," said Ellison, in 
reference to the short subjects 
and animation pieces shown 
with each feature film. "They 
depict a new style of animation 
and contemporary times for 
animation shorts." 

The list included Blind 
Man '5 Bull, a double take on 
human curiosity; Mindscape, 
a master's thesis on stop· 

motion photography; 
Spaceborne, a picture of the 
universe at its most majestic: 
The Club, an animated lesson 
in male stereotypesj and 
Closed Mondays, an off·the· 
wall account of one man's stay 
at an art museum. The third 
piece was an Oscar nominee 
for 1978. while the last 
selection received a 1974 
Academy Award and has won 
honors at the World

Arts 
Animation Fest"val. The 
cartoon antics of Bugs Bunny, 
Mr. Magoo, and the Road 
Runner, and the human 
escapades of The Three 
Stooges round out the 
midnight movie showings. 

"The response has been 
phenomenal," said Ellison . 
"There's been a tremendous 
interest in midnight movies. 
We're also getting a good 
response with the short 
subjects. A lot of people are 
very interested in film-
making." 

The film series runs every 
Friday and Saturday.

them to care for an exhaU5ted, 
diseaae-p!one people. 

Vice Minister Kong Som 01 believeli 
in a special "Cambodian way to 
Communill1l," one in which even 
someone like himself - a onetime US 
government employee with no 
revolutionary credentials - can play 
a parI. 

Mrs. SoulI;anna, a former student, 
and her young daughter tried for a year 

to live in the new communist society 
but couldn't accept its rules . They took 
the roads to Thailand and the West. 

••• 
This northwestern city once had a 

sturdy community of about 800 
Catholics - and the only Cambodian 
ever ordained by the Vatican as a 
bishop. Nou Phol was the bishop's 
secretary. 

Bi.hop Tep 1m. brave, outspoken. 
and widely respected by Catholics and 
Buddhi.ts alike. was executed by Pol 
Pot's communi.t. in ) 975, as were all 
other priest in Cambodia. Killings , 
disease and escapes to Thailand ha ve 
reduced Battambang's Catholics to 
about 150. 

"There is nobody to lay Mass but I 
had enough training to qualify as a 
teacher of catechism," says Nou Phol. 
"Maybe one day we will have our own 
priests again, but if I left there would be 

nobody to continue the faith ." 
Pale, thin and partially paralyzed 

from a stroke, Nou Phol still works in 
the bishop's residence . But it is now a 
government office and he has become 
a kind of houseboy and a repairman of 
typewriters. 

The Battambang Cathedral was 
razed by Pol Pol, its stones used for 
road repair. But the new regime has 
allowed a nearby former nunnery to be 
used as a prayer hall and an old crucifix 
- the head of Christ twisted out of 
shape - was found among the debris. 

It is here that Nou Phol holds his 
religion classes. Withered palm leaves 
frame the door and windows, the 
leftovers of Battambang's first 
Christmas celebration in five years. 

"We start below zero. We must 
rebuild our country. We must help the 
peasants because they are innocent 
victims," says Kong Som 01, the 

intense vice minister for agriculture. 
"Those who run abroad are just 

helping themselves and their families," 
he says, speaking excellent English. 

A bespectacled . man in his 40s, 
Kong Som 01 wears a simple black 
shirt and rough sandals on his bare 
feel. His wife and two children died of 
disease and hunger under Pol Pot. 

He was educated at \che University of 
Georgia in the United States and once 
worked for the US Information 
Service. Despite his lack of a 
revolutionary background, the vice 
minister says he and others like him in 
the current government are trusted and 
will not be swept aside once younger, 
communist-trained cadre are available 
in large numbers. 

What about other communist 
countries which shunted aside all but 
the true believers once their revolutions 
were consolidated? 

Sewage May Be Killing DUDlb Fish 
Conlinued 'rom page 6 

1be fish may be smart 
enough to swim away from the 
sewage. and the smaller 
organisms are sure to 
regenerate themselves, but 
t..unan exposure to the water 
can be very dangerous, 
Melboum warns. 

"Sewage containli all the 
pathogens you can imagine, 
depending on who was sick up 
in the contributing area. It 
could be as simple as an eye 

infections, or diarrhea or as 
serious as infectious hepatitis," 
he said. 

"The principle problem is 
ingestion. You can walk 
around in it (the contaminated 
wilter), splash around in it as 
long as you don't have any 
open wounds or do not ingest 
it," he says. 

"The problem comes," he 
adds, "when you tell 
somebody thai they can go out 
there and splash around 10 

~,?Y 

long as they don't get water in 
their mouth; then the first thing 
you get is the hand-to·mouth 
situation - scooping water 
and then touching the lips." 

"Pretty soon," he continues, 
"everybody will be believing 
that the water is lafe and we'll 
be dragging them out with 
ropes . The best solution is to 
just keep everyone out." 

In addition to humans, 
some of the popular boating in 
the bar has been restricted .

and such restrictions have not 
met with full compliance, 
Melbourn says. 

"Boating is now permitted 
as long as the craft is stable 
enough and won't capsize and 
does not involve people getting 
into the water to launch it," he 
says. This ban included 
rowing and crew, a popular 
sport for many San Diegans 
and UCSD students alike. 

"They (rowers) have been 
in the water, and we warned 

them about the dangers but 
they did not heed our advice," 
he says. 

And until the water is 
officially pronounced "fully 
safe" for humans, Melbourn 
advises that everyone should 
stay out of the bay for his or 
her own health preservation. 
"Fully safe" means when the 
signs prohibiting swimming 
and boating are removed, not 
simply when the sewage flow 
is discontinued, he stresses.

Continued from page 9 
approach which allows for 
growth and change. 

But both have completely 
neglected a critique of th ir 
own per onal paradigms. 
Sagan and Bateson ar 
di ciples of the ien tific 
m thod, the dominant 
methodologi al paradigm 
which beth nhan es and 
limits contemporary re earch. 

Th scientific method 
stresses three conditions for 
achi ving a "good" result : a 
logical, parsimoniou solution; 
repeatability of result!t; and 
communicability of the results. 
F or most re!tearch this method 
is efficient and commendable. 

Problems are encountered 
in areas where these three 
principles are not exacting or 
reliable, for example in the 
area of psychological research 
which deals with altered states 
of consciousness. 

Bateson is concerned with 
establishing a way of dealing 
with the environment that 
functions within the pattern 
that connects. Yet nowhere 
does he even attempt to 
describe that pa ttern, except 
with lyrical poetic descriptions. 
The knowledge of a zen mystic 
seems to rank quite highly in 
Bateson's priorities, and yet 
th is knowledge is rarely 
communicable or easily 
reproduced . 

Do we adhere to the 
scientifi method and ignore 
the knowledge, or do we shift 
out paradigm? Bate on offers 
no answers. 

Sagan is even Ie s receptive 
than Bat son to anything 
which steps outside of an

orderly and precise world-
vi w. Broca's Brain has

"paras ience." Sagan doe 
not h sitate to invoke the 
sa red litany of the scientific 
m thod to di p I any validity 
which th ese "P!t eudo-
s ien es," invol ing precogni-
tive dreaming or astral 
proj ction , mayor may not 
hav . 

As a popularizer of cience, 
agan is imm n ely success-

ful, his books usually ending 
up a bestsellers. With this 
kind of potential to influen e 
public opinion, on wishes he 
would b more careful about 
letting his paradigmatic 
prejudices dir this prais or 
scorn. 

Alternatives to th scientific 
method are still rare, but there 
is a ense of a paradigm shift in 
the laboratory air. Philoso-
phers like Paul Feyerabend in 
Against Method are proposing 
alternate systems for 
conducting research. 

Feyerabend propose 
anarchy in science, asserting 
that only when "anything 
goes' can radically new and 
innovative knowledge be 
revealed. The development of 
different ways of eeing 
garners attention, but the 
scientific method still 
dominates. 

The cientific method is 
obviously a good one; 
otherwise, it would not have 
stood up und r repeated and 
varied experimental research. 

It is becoming increasingly 
important, how v r, that th
