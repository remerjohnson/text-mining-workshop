Try Medi-Cal if 
Insurance Too Costly 

Students who cannot afford UCSD's $34 per quarter health 
supplemental insurance program may still insure themselves 
against major medical expenses with MediCal, according to 
Dr. Robert Allen, director of Student Health Services. 

Medi-Cal full health insurance is available to persons who 
have liquid assets no greater than $1,500 (including cash, 
bank accounts and stocks), and a monthly income no greater 
than $291. Only US citizens and resident aliens are eligible for 
the program, Allen said. 

Medi·CaI exempts many grants, 'Ioans and family 
allowances from personal income. Persons may be eligible for 
partial Medi·Cal coverage if their income or assets exceed 
eligibility criteria. 
. Most physician, hospital and prescription drugs are included 
In Medi-Cal coverage. Any service that's "medically 
necessary" as defined by a panel of physicians. is covered. 
Physical and mental well being are included in this delinition. 

Psychiatric, optical, physical and speech therapy services 
are limited to two months although exceptions are made. 

When compared to many health insurance policies, Medi· 
Cal has two major advantages, said Elaine Crouse, Medi·CaI 
public officer. There is no reduction in coverage for having a 
pre·existing illness or injury and persons can apply for Medi· 
Cal after the fact, she said. 

M~st of the disadvantages of the system are from the 
prOVIder's standpoint, Crouse noted, saying','They don't care 
(or the billing system or payment leveL" 

Medi-CaI's payment level is continually assessed by an 
appointed panel of providers. The figure is based on the 
average fee charged for a specific service by providers 
(doctors, therapists, hospitals) in the stae. This figure is usually 
60 percent lower than the doctors' normal fees. An increase in 
Medi-Cal's fee payment means an increase in the state tax dollar 
as Medi-Cal is partially state supported. 

~e continual increase in the cost of health care is causing 
providers to demand fee adjustments. With the passage of 
Proposition 13, it is increasingly difficult to adjust payment 
levels to providers, observed a Medi·CaI official. This is 
causing more of a turnover in providers, he said. 

At this time, all hopitals in San Diego County and over 75 
percent of the physicians accept Medi-Cal.

China Exchange, Terms Told 
Pact With 3 Universities 

Pact With 3 Universities May Be Best ir- US 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

News Editor 
An agreement for an exchange program 

Chinese Studies chairman Paul Pickowicz says 
has the potential to be "the best in the nation" 
has been concluded between UCSD and three 
universities in the People's Republic of China. 

The program calls for the exchange of 
professors and graduate students, and possibly 
even undergraduates, with two Chinese 
universities, Huazhong Institute of Technology 
in central China and Chungqing University in 
"western," or inland, China. 

A looser agreement of understanding was 
reached with Jiaotong University in Shanghai,. 
where two UCSD professors have just 
concluded a year of study. 

Pickowicz says the program with put 
UCSD on a par with or ahead of what he says 
are the two best China exchange programs now 
in the country, at Wisconsin and UCLA. And, 
he adds,only three or four other universities in 
the country have exchange programs with the 
People's Republic. 

The ten points of the agreement, signed by 
Chancellor McElroy and the presidents of the 
two universities during the trip last month by the 
eight-rnan UCSD delegation to China: 

1. "The two sides agree to cooperate with 
each other for research projects of common 
in teres t. " 

2. Lecturers can be sent to each university, 
but only at the invitation of the host, and 
"normally" for not more than one year. 

3. The ptofessors at each school will receive 

5. The two sides will propose graduate 
students for study. 

6. "In case the scholars' or students' interests 
do not correspond with those members of the 
respective university to which they have 
applied, that university will by prepared to help 
in their placement at other appropriate 
institutions. " 

(Pickowicz explains that since all three 
Chinese universities are technicaJ institutions, 
social science and humanities area exchange 
students might be allowed to study at other 
universities in China.) 

7. Academic discussions will be sponsored 
by host universities for exchange personnel. 

8. The universities will exchange 
"information," including, for example, library 
catalogues. No books, except duplicates, wiD 
leave UCSD for China, Pickowicz says.

Stopping NeW 
Becauae of lut week', delay of a crucial San Diego 

City Council vote on North City West, the UCSD 
community has one last chance to throw its weight 
behind the effort to stop, or at least substantially alter, a 
deyelopment that could drastically damage the quality of 
life around us. . 

The vote was delayed through the efforts of the 
Coalition for Responsible Planning, a Del Mar-based 
group opposed to the development. The question before 
the City Council is whether the first 2,078 units of the 
nine-phase, 40,OOO-resident development should be 
built, but observers believe the total development would 

, be hard to stop once the council approves the first phase. 
North City West is poorly planned. It is 
~nvironmentally unwi~ because of the effects on air 
quality, traffic congestion, and the beaches. It is unwise 
from an energy standpoint, because most of the people 
who would live in North City West would work many 
miles from home, and many of them would insist on 
driving to work. It is socially unwise because the houses 
wiD cost $150,000 and more, out of the reach of the 
low income workers and renters who need housing in San 
Diego. 

UCSD students have clout if they want to use it. The 
Student Cooperative, the AS's predecessor, was able to 
force the developers of University Town Centre to scale 
down their plans substantilly. The AS, through its 
external affairs office, should marshall communitv 
. members who are opposed to the develoPment and get 
them to the October 17 City Council meeting. External 
_AHain Commissioner Linda Sabo has already 
-expreuecl interest in fighting the development; she 
should perlUade her colleagues to join her. If the AS has 
to rent buses to get students, faculty and staffers to the 
meeting, it should; the money would be better spent that 
way than on sending lobbyists to Sacramento. 

The handful of American Indians at UCSD are 
jusifiably angry at the Economic Opportunity Program's 
failure to hire a new Native American recruit. They are 
threatening to sue the university if the recruiter, who 
resigned last spring, is not replaced . 

. It is true that, as officials point out, the small number 
of Indians on campus do not justify a full-time recruiter. 
(EOP officials·try to apportion seats on the committee 
ba~ on the percentage representation of various ethnic : 
groups in the university and the community.) But the fact 
remains that American Indians are under.represented in 

. the University of California, and especially at UCSD, . 
compared to their numbers in the population at large. 

It is ironic that American society, which owes virtually 
everything it has to Native Americans, has been least 
successful in finding room in society for them. Many 
young Indians re torn between their cultural ties and their 
inclinations toward leaving home, going to school and 
getting jobs. EOP should have an American Indian 
recruiter working full time to help other Indians realize 
that there is room for them here. The responsibility for 
bringing new Indian students to campus should not be left 
by EOP to those who are here now. 

Question Authority? 
"Question Authority." 
That was the ringing slogan of Carlos Montalvo and 

the other membrs of his slate in last year's Associated 
Students election. Montalvo won. He is authority now, 
and he's acting like it. 

For instance, this week Montalvo and others are 
holding a VIP party to thank the people who helped bring 
the pub to campus. If you want lunch or a beer during the 
party, forget it; it's invitation-only. 

While you're waiting outside, you may want to 
question authority.

Arab Stereotype 

WASHINGTON - Most of the federal 
government officially r~ns out of <\uthority to fund 
programs and meet payrolls today but the Senate has 
scheduled an attempt to pass a stop-gap measure. 

However, the future of the legislation is uncertain. 
The House is in a week-long recess and the Senate bill 
is almost certain to contain provisions not to the 
House's liking. 

The stage for the last-minute measure was set late 
Friday when the House refused to bend the 
controversial language attached to an emergency-
funding measure. That language would have imposed 
strict standards on federal fuoding of abortions and 
would have given members of Congress a 5.5 percent 
pay raise - $3,200 a year. 

The Senate would have accepted the pay raise but 
the abortion language has been rejected four times 
already this year by that body. And so, just before 
midnight Friday, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to 
kill the funding bill.

quarterly averages, says Funk. 
SCURI awarded 46 grants last 
year. 

Each quarter, SCURI awards 
"mini-lVants" of up to $300 for 
an individual project and $400 
for a group. Students can 
reapply for the grants, if extra 
funds are available. 

A total of $2,200 in grants is 
available this fall according to 
Funk. 

SCURI receives $9,000 in 
"seed money" from the 
Chancellor's Advisory 
Committee for Instructional 
ImP'Overnent ProlVams arid

Students. 

The research projects ha ve to

say. Funk, "meaning 
something you would do for a

course)". Last year SCURI 
fuuded projects ranging from a 
atudy of single parent adoptions 
to research on the migratory 
habits of thespiny-tailed lobster. 

SCURI applicants must 
attend a Grant Writing 
Workshop to leilrn techniques 
for writing "clear, condse" for 
writing "e/ear, concise" 
proposals, Funk says. 1be 
proposals are reviewed by a

1980 and ending June 30, 1985. It will continue beyond five 
years if neither side objects to the treaty. . 

10. The univenities involved will forward each other a plan of 
exchange every Jan. IS. 

Pickowicz says no precise method of determining who from 
UCSD will go to China has been established, but said that he, 
McElroy, Dean of Graduate Studies Manny Rotenburg and 
AME54 Professor Bert Fong, all of whom negotiated the 
agreement, wiU probably work together to choose applicants. 

The agreement was made after the presidents of Huazhong 
and Chunqing contacted UCSD officials about sending scholars 
back and forth. 

Though all three Chinese universites are technical schools, it 
is unlikely UCSD will send many scientists to China, Pickowicz 
says. 

"Chinese universities are from 10-12 years behind .the latest 
developments in this country, or at UCSD," he says. " 
"We" be sending people from the Chinese Studies department in 
Literature, the Social Sciences and the Humanities mostly." 

"China wiH be sending scienlisll to UCSD, however. They 
want .ciences. That'. one of the reasons they're singling out 
UCSD. They're not interested in any other subject."

two from Jiaolong are already plaMing to work at UCSD.

Surfers Struggle With Lousy Waves 
cut-backs and off-the-lip for posture while kneeling By Clifford Bayuk 

The lite wal Black's 
Beach, Southern Califom-
ia's answer to the French 
Riviera. The event was a 
five hour surfing contest in 
crisp 66 degree water. 

The contest was open to 
all UCSD students and staff, 
but there were no staff 
members who entered. 

Among the approximate-
ly one-hundred and fifty 
people in attendance, there 
were . plenty of frisbees, 
surfboards, bars of 
surfboard wax, bikinis, and 
of course surfers. Plenty of 
people came, but the waves 
never did show up. The 
surfers had trouble trying to 
squeeze perfonnance points 
out of the uncooperative 
surf. 

Despite the below 
averaee wave heights, the 
contest was a good display of 
surfing and knee-boarding 
under difficult conditions. 
Among the 48 entrants who 

p~icipated, four champa 
emerged. 

Engholm was second, and 
third place went to Greg 
Opean. 

In the women'a competi-
tionn, Sandy Gron captured 
the championship, while 
Denise Navarro came in 
second. and LorreUa Neary 

took third place. Neary 
sustained a head injury 
from her board, but she 
apparently brushed off the 
effects as the competition 
continued. The women (the 
only three in ' the contest) 
showed fine examplea of 

maneuvers. 
In the knee boarding 

competition, Bill Lemer 
took the title, Chria Allern 
was second, and Curt 
Garrison third. The judgea 
in attendance were looking 

on the board (smaller than 
an ordinary surfboard), and 
the length of the ride as two 
major requirements for a 
high score. 

In the men'. open 
competition, for UCSD team 
members and other 
experienced lurfen, Billy 
Sterns, a team member, 
took the championlhip, 
.urfing "conai.tently 
radically" throughout the 
contest. Geoff Biehl, a 
fellow team member, 
placed second, and TilJl 
LeFort finiahed third. 

According to Hank 
Warner, one of the three 
jUdfes at the meet, tile poor 
aur condition made it· 
difficult to diltinguish the 
mediocre rides, while on the 
other hand, the good rides 
were very noticeable. The 
perfect score given by a 
judge to a .. rfer on a 
particular wave ia 20, but 
the judges aeldom awarded 
a score over nine points 
because of the lacklu.ter 
conditions.

Leads In Defense Spoil UCSD 
Chances in Water Polo Tourney 

By Jon Goetz 
Sports Editor 

Water Polo Coach Russ 
Halferkamp always says char 
defense is the only consistent 
aspect of the sport. And when 
that defense isn't clicking, it 
can mea n the diUerence 
between winning and losing a 
game-or a tournament. 

For the UCSD water polo 
team, lacking a soljd defense 
may have meallt both this 
weekend. 

In the first two games of the 
four·game Whittier College 
tourney last weekend, the 
Tritons smothered Whittier 
12·9 and Pomona-Pitzer 13-
7, making them the favorites 
of the double·elimination 
tournament. But in the next 

game, against Cal State Los 
Angeles, the team fell apart, 
Ioting 1 1-7 . 

' Three starters fouled out of 
the game, the defense was 
inconsistent , shots were hitting 
the bar 01 the goal and 
bouncing off. and new goalie 
Pat Vergn let in a couple of 
"hokey goals," according to 
Hafferkamp. 

UCSD's biggest problem is 
when we try to play with just 
our physical skills, said the 
coach. When we try to play 
mentally, we improve 100 . 
percent. 

We tried to match skills 
against Cal State LA. UCSD 
ust doesn't have the skals to do 
this," said Hafferkamp. 

.The team settled down after

the game and discussed their 
defense , but the results weren't 
enough to beat Long Beach 
State in the final g,me of the 
weekend, and the Tritons lost 
5-4. Up 4 ·2 at halftime, the 
UCSD team couldn't put in 
another goal in the entire 
second hall. Long -Beach tied 
the score, then went ahead in 
the last minutes of the fuurth 
quarter. 

"Offensively, I'm pleased," 
said Hafferkamp. Defen· 
sively, we're still rusty." 

The top juniors, Kai Loedel, 
Dan Eby and Dan Crane, 
have been carrying the weight 
of the offense in these early 
games. Eby scored half of the 
team's 12 goals against 
Whittier. Loedel scored at

Still, Haflerkamp sees this deceiving to say we lost two 

weekend's playas an games. We had the potential 
encouraging sign for the to win the tournament."

What If They Rained Out 
A 'Meet and 3 Teams Came? Surfers Struggle 

By Barbara H .. s 
The Triton harriers didnt let 

a few rNndrops, or even 
cancelled meet, stop them 
from C;2Plpeting Saturday. 

Seven runners travelled to 
Santa Barbara Friday for the 
scheduled Saturday cross 
country AII·CaI meet, only to 
be confronted by stormy 
weather and torrential rains. 

Davis would have placed firllt, 
followed by Santa Cruz and 
then by San Diego. 

Under the somewhat 
bizarre circumstances, Skief 
seemed satisfied with the 
team's performance. "We did 
very well considering the 
psychological difficulties we 
underwent ," he said. 

course to be remarked. I was 
pleased with the effort put out 
by the team," said Skief. 

Despite less than ideal 
conditions lor the race, all the 
UCSD runners finished well 
under 27 minutes for the 4.5 
mile impromptu course . 

Contfnued #ram fHJIe 5 
judges will be fint looking d 
the length of ride, the 
surfer's wave strategy or 
wave selection, the wave's 

. size, and finally, the 
succes.ful maneuvers 
perfonned by the surfer," 
ex~lained Warner. 

Each surfer'. final score is 
based on his top three 

waves. In the time of a heat, 
usually fifteen minutes, a 
surfer can use several 
strategies. He can catch as 
many waves as possible, sit 
back and wait for a great 
wave, and ielect a few good 
waves. 

Whatever the strategy, 
the object is to please ~e 
judges. Discovering three hours before the scheduled starting 

time that the event had been 
called off, the disappointed 
athletes decided to stage their 
own contest instead. 

"The runners were mentally 
ready to go, and then after we 
found out the meet was 
cancelled we still had to wait 
an hour and a h,alf for the

the start, whistling and yelling 
from the moment he walked 
onstage. 

With consummate show-
manship, Diddley kept the 
audience waiting with a 
reverse striptease: take the 
guitar out of its case; flash it to 
cheers of approval as the 
audience recognized its 
signature box.shape; unroll 
the strap and put the guitar on; 
then unroll, slowly, the cord 
and plug it in before beginning 
to strut and talk with the box. 

Bo Diddley pioneered a 
whole approach to the electric 
guitar. Rather than seeing the 
instrument purely as a 
mechanism for producing

guitar sounds, it becomes, in 
his hands, a strange new 
gadget that produces soun<.!s 
effects. 

Today, it may seem like 
pretty standard stuff, but in 
1954, when Diddley began 
messing around wilh the guitar 
professionally, it was a radical 
move. It was the creation of a 
legend. 

But the legend 'has been 
quiet for a while - Diddley 
says it was by choice - as a 
reactiion to industry rip.offs 
which he claims have 
victimized him. 

"At first it was all for fame 
and fortune and all that. I 
loved it until I finally woke up," 
he said.

The purpose of e~rr ~ang product ;s the same:

At Wang Laboratories, we make computer and word processing systems. 
But we're really not in the computer or word processing business. 

Our business is productivity. And that's a people business'. 

Because it's people who produce. Machines just. make it easier. 
Maybe all this sounds obvious. But you'd. be surprised how many com-
puter and word processing .manufacturers forget that the end users of 
their products are people. . 

At Wang, we never forget. 

That's why our products are simpler t9 use than theirs. And more 
efficient. 

And that's w.hy we're growing faster than anybody else in the business. 

And that's why we're. interested in. Bachelor's, Master's or PhD. 
candidates.

Diddley's Blues "Besides," he said, "you know if they're beatin' me (out of the money) if they're 
beatin's Uncle. They're not 
payin' taxes on that money if 
they're not payin' me. 

Continuecllrom ",.,. 8 
-"That was, oh,about 10 

y.ears ago. 
"You got to watch 

your manager, watch the 
record people. Don't bat your 
eyes for a moment. There are 
a few honest people in this 
world but not many," he said. 

"It's like a (royalty) check 
would come in from Denmark 
for $900,000 and some guy at 
the record company gets it. 
Now he doesn't say 'what's his 
fair share, let's give it to him.' 
He says' give him a $100, or 

.give him $1000, he'll be 
happy. 
. "And you know I was. I 
thought things were great 'til l 
.tarted to notice names on my 
statement (from the record 
company) that I cidn't know. 

_ That's when you started seein' 
Ie •• and less of So Diddley." 

He leaned forward to peer 
at the interviewer through his 
thick·lensed glasses and 
a.ked, "Do you under.tand 
what I'm sayin'?" 

He noted that one of the 
problems he has facM with the 

alleged rip·off is prO'll. 
"What do you do when you 

know it's goin' on and you just 
can't prove it? What can you 
d ?" o. 

One answer, Diddley said, 
is to have royalty payments-
particularly thyose from 
overseas sales - handled 
through the federal govern· 
ment, much as the musician's 
union handles payment for 
session work. 

"If those record companies 
that have had claims like this 
proven against them were 
required to go through the 
government it would work. 

"You know it's so easy to 
get money in and out of this 
contry. In every other country 
it's got to go through the 
government if Chess 
(Records, the label Diddley's 
been with for 25 years) gets 'a 
check from someone in 
England, it's been sent out of 
England through the 
goverrvnent. They pay the 
money to the government and 
the English government sends 
the money to Chess.

hooted with laughter, "Hell, 
no. I don't even see it when I'm 
not playin'. Sometimes I forget 
where I put it." 

Known for many years for 
his large and solid band, 
Diddley said he no longer 
keeps a road band together. 

"T ourin' with my own band 
is just totally ridiculous for the 
money. We've ~one crazy in 
this country with wages. 

"It costs too much money to 
transport a whole band . Hell , if 
my guitar weighed just 10 
pounds more, I'd have to pay 
to take it on the plane with me. 

"Everybody likes music," 
he said, "but nobody wants to 
put up with the crap a musician 
has to put up with. They don't 
want to move your equipment. 
they don' t want to give you 
any money; try going to a 
bank for a loan. The minute 
you tell them your business is 
show business, they's around 
the comer talkin' with some 
friend sayin', 'Well he lookeds 
honest, but then he told me .... ' 
And you don't ever see them

recession. Hah, I say 
recession is just depression' 
daughter. We not gonna solve 
it with the people running 
things now. They sweep too 
much stuff under the rug. 

"My momma told me when 
I was just a little bitty dude that 
you gotta sweep things out the 
door, not under the rug, or the 
rug gets lumpy. I'd say that 's 
where we're at now. 

"We (Americans) been lied 
to so much , we're breakin' up 
like a ship in real rough waters. 
We need to get someone in 
there with enough balls to tell 
the truth . 

"And I want to say one 
thing in closin' this interview; I 
want to say it real clear just like 
this," he said, leaning forward 
and pointing with gnarled, 
calloused hands. 

"God bless America . God' 
bless us because we're gonna 
need some blessin' if we're 
gonna make it."
