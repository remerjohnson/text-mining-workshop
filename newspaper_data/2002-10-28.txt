have called into ques tion the fa ir-
ness of proposed changes to 
UCSD's academic integrity poli-

will vote on Oct. 29. 

T he proposed amendments 
made by the Committee on 
Educational Policy would 
change the process in which 
academic dishonesty cases are 
handled. 

Currently, a faculty member 
accusing a student of academic 
dishonesty presents his or her 
case to the dean of the student's 
college. The dean then attempts 
to make an informal resolution 
with the student. If the student 
does not accept the resolution,

would be handled jf the proposed amend-
ments pass would involve a faculty member 
presenting his or her case to the student con-
duct coordinator. Faculty members proposed 
this change to simplify the process and ma~e 
deliberations fairer for students across all SIX 
colleges. 

Once the case is presented to the SCC, a 
board is selected to hear the case if the student 
denies the charges. The SCC can advise the 
faculty member on how to present the case, or 
the SCC can present the case for the faculty 
member. If the student is found guilty at the 
end of the hearing, the SCC administers the 
punishment. 

The SCC's centralization of power has 
created a debate over its fairness. Faculty 
members and administrators who support the 

changes argue that the changes are fair 
because they simplify the process and will 
make the process more efficient. 

"I think [the procedure] will work more 
efficiently," said Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson. "Hopefully, it will be 
fairer and more just and procedurally more 
clear for students as wel1 as facul ty and oth-
ers." 

However, concerned students and mem-
bers of the A.S. Council disagree that fairness 
efficiency wil1 be increased.

of the process," said David Goodwin, an at-
large member of the Student Council at

The Rachel's Chall enge pro-
gram is based largely on the ideals 
of this essay and other writings left 
behind by Rachel. 

Rachel's Challenge is an assem-
bly program for junior high and 
high schools designed "ro srop the 

whirlwind of student life and to 
bring [your] smdents face-to-face 
with reality," according to the pro-

The program uses video 

footage, personal interviews with 
Columbine survivors and profes-
sionally trained speakers. 

Rachel wanted to be a fam ous 
actress, to touch people's lives :md 

to be a missionary, accord ing to her 
father. This program, and his rours 
across the country to church 
groups and schools, :m.: his way of 
fulfilling his daughter'S dream. 

"My daughter'S life and death 
will not be in vain" Scutt sa id . 

Though Oct 24's assembly in 
the Price Center Ballrooms was a 
reli gious event, Rachel's 
Challenge is separate from the 
ecclesiasri ca l rours madc by Scott 
and his wife. 

"Rachel's Challenge is a totally 
secular program meant ro promote

Scott said. 

At the concl usion of Scott 's

"I challenge you to reach OLlt to

who has tOltched YOlt ," said Scort. 
"Realize thar li fe is shorr, make it

Gov. Gray Davis' term 
in office is marked by \ 

many valuable successes 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Contributing Writer 

I' our vea rs ago, Ca li fo rn ia elected G ray Davis by a 
landslide 20 POll1 ts, ushen ng in a golden era of state 
wcll-bc lI1g tha t lasted for a good rwo years. His term bas 
,een more than Its fai r share of stumbling blocks - the 
bumi ng of the Silicon Valley bubble, the energy crisis 
Jnd Cali fo rni a's budget de fic it - but through it all, he 
has maintained an aura of confidence and calm. 

Davis i stiff, meticulous, efficient and demanding of 
hiS sta ff - a modern George Washington of sorts. On 
the other side is the GOP nominee for governor, Bill 

SIITIOn, a grinning businessman 
wh om the Los Angeles Times 
terms - "The Accidental P R 0 Candidate" and the polar oppo-site of Davis in both demeanoF and ideals. Certainly his biggest obstacle will be the shc:c:r success 
of Davis' term in office. 

The power crisis, while nor 
caused by Davis, was his prob-

le m to solve - and solve it he did, as weU as anyone can 
solve such a complicated and far-reaching problem. The 
cornerstones of his solution are conservation and the 
accelerated licensing of power plants; the former a liber-
al approach that's working wonderfully, and the latter a 
conservative approach, one that a Republican wouId 
have instituted in Davis' position. Together they have 
worked to effectivly deal with a potentially devastating 
problem. 

This year alone, Davis has signed numerous bills that 
control greenhouse emissions, negligent gun manufac-
turers and protect employees and victims of sexual 
assaul t. The greenhouse gases bill, AB 1493, regulateS

Push against Iraq a distraction 
Bush team trying to get voters with tough talk 

By VALERIE BURNS 
Senior Staff Writer 

It is the smoke screen of all 
smoke screens. For the politically 
cynical, a threatening war is the 
most efficient way to ease a presi-
dent's unfavorable domestic policy 
by a reluctant populace, Such a 
melodrama is being played ou[ 
even now. 

\l\Ihen Bush first began press-
ing war with Iraq, he stressed the 
link berween al Qaeda and Iraq. 
After the uproar from the media 
and public questioning whether 
this was true, the Bush administra-
tion quickly changed its position 
to the "weapons of mass destruc-
tion" argument. Sadly for the 
Bush administration, its first 
stance was actually the better 
argument. 

All things considered, the 
Bush administration inconclu-
sively exciting the American pub-
lic over Iraq appears to be a typi-
cal example of wagging the dog . 
for election day purposes, as well 
as passing a Republican agenda 
while the public and press are 
focusing on the potential war 
issues at hand. 

It's difficult to accept that the 
White House didn't expect the 
North Koreans having a nuclear 
bomb to become an issue. In the 
past week or so, the previous 
attention surrounding Iraq has ' 
been refocused to North Korea, a' 
reaction due to the fact that North 
Korea's possession of a nuclear 
weapon would be an open viola-
tion of the 1994 Clinton Nuclear 
Disarmament Treaty. This infor-
mation and the subsequent answer 
by the Bush administration has 

\ 

• 

NATIONAL 

" Bush's administration has 
used and continues to use 
the prospect of war as a 

rallying flag far 
Republicans , .. " 

made it clear that the Bush admin-
istration was never entirely sure 
that it was going to wage war on 
Iraq. Clearly, Bush's staff hadn't 
thought North Korea's behavior 
would become an issue on the way 
to war with Iraq. 

According to National Security 
Ad,,;ser Condoleeza Rice, the 
Bush administration doesn't have 
any plans to penalize North Korea 
for its behavior. Keeping in mind 
the absence of established rhetoric 
on what to do about North Korea, 
the subsequent holes in Bush's 

WMD-Iraq argument and the 
speed at which the president has 
quickly switched roles from fight-
ing totalitarianism to master 
republican campaigner, one can 
conclude several things. 

fraq is not the major issue for 
Bush, and is in fact one that can be 
pushed aside for domestic issues, 
even though it was just a few 
weeks ago that the Bush adminis-
tration made it seem to the U.S. 
public that we had to overthrow 
Saddam now or never. 

The wavering of the Bush 
administration as to whether or 
not it will pursue war on Iraq 
shows that Bush's administration 
has ~sed and continues to use the 
prospect of war as a rallying flag 
for Republicans and is an attempt 
to swing voters in the approaching 
November elections. 

There is also clear evidence 
that Bush has taken advantage of 
the increased attention on inter-
national politics to push his 
domestic agenda. On OCt. 24, 
President Bush signed into law a 
defense-spending bill that increas-
es Pentagon spending in almost 
every area for the budget year that 
began Oct. 1 by a total of more 
than $34 billion, or 11 percent, 
over the previous year - the 
biggest increase in 20 years. 
Without all the drummed-up sup-
port over Iraq, this bill may very 
well have never been passed. Bush 
has p'oliticized the impending war 
by saying that those D.C. politi-
cians that are against the war are 
unpatriotic. 

He has also scared voters. 
Voters would be more aware of

OPINION 5 

Children can be the 
scariest things of all 
Adults must be protected from 

kids's unintentional terror 

basically 
Carrie Elizabeth Sklar 

I f the mass amounts of bite-size candy being flaunted in super-markets are any indication, 
Halloween is right around the cor-
ner. So to get in the spirit of the 
season (because I do that from time 
to time), I want to talk about some-
thing truly scary: little kids. 

Now, when it comes to kids, I 
know what I'm talking about. Not 
only did I used to be one (no I was 
not born a full-grown bitch), but I 
was also a camp counselor all four 
years I was in high school. 

That's right, people used to pay 
me to foster the well-being, growth 
and happiness of their children. The 
future of America (or at least a small 
part of Los Angeles) was in my 
hands. 

Scary, I know. 
But the point of this particular 

article is that kids themselves are 
just plain disturbing. For one thing, 
they look way ·too much like 
midgets, which, as we ali' know, are 
rather frightening. 

But when you 're a camp coun-
~e1or, kids represent the ultimate 
menace. Not just because. they have 
large and often constipated parents, 
but because they outnumber you. If 
the cdm:ation of this country ever 
improves and little kids learn to 

count accurately, they' ll realize that 
they can take over the worl d. And 
then things will m rlly go to Hel l. 

Yet it's the things kids actually 
say that scare m e the must. 
'vVboever said kids should be seen 
~ nd not heard was at least hal f ri g-hI. 

One day I was sitting un the 
playground . minding my uwn bUSI-
ness - oh no, wait , I was wa tching 
my little group of live-year-olds, 
since that 's what I was getting paid 
to do. Ri iiiii iight. 

Anyway, up runs Nicky, :l young 
lad who liked to stream words 
together and pretend they maLle 
sense. Typical kid. And in typical 
adult fashion, I pasted a smile on 
my face and shifted into patroniz-
i ng-young- c hi Id re n - wi th -t he -
squeakiest-voice-ever mode. 

Me (squeaking): "Hi Nicky! " 
Nicky (out of breath from pl ay-

ing Spider-Man on the jungle 
gym): "Hi l " 

A long pause follows beca use: 
First of all , I forgot to inject caf-
feine directly into my blood stream 
that morning and am thus too tired 
to feign interest; and second, 
because 1 know Nicky's mom well 
enough to ignore her son. 

Nicky (completely unaware that 
I am ignoring him): "Carrie, YOll 
know what I wanna be when I ~row 
up?" ' ... 

Me (God, I sound like Minnie 
Mouse on lithium): "What do YOU 
want to be?" .

The defendants allegedly beat 
her, gashed her head and then 

COMMENTARY 
dragged her semiconscious body 
to the garage, where they tight-
ened a rope around her neck until 
she seemed dead. Then they 
drove her body to n remote spot 
in the Sierra Nevada foothi lls and 
buried her in a shallow grave, 
where it was found two weeks 
later, according to a police affi-
davit. 

The term may be new, but the 
concept is as ancient as human 
kind - Araujo was the victim of a 
hate crime. Araujo was murdered 
because she was different, because 
she didn't fit in, because he didn 't 
conform to a standard of behavior 
that we can accept as normal. And 
that's ,1Iways an excuse for dis-
crimination. 

There is no justification for 
murder. There is no explanation 
that can all eviate the suffering of 

the victims of ignorant wrath . 
That ignorance is more preva-

lent than we think. Homophobia 
is everywhere . It's running ram-
pant and takin g lives. It keeps kids 
in the closet, making them afraid 
to show who they are - afraid to 
admit that they are different from 
the re t of the world that simply 
refuses to understand or accept 
them. 

That refusal is costing live s. 
This isn't the 18th century, and 
it's not the rural South . It's here 
and now, in California . The same 
discrimination that has been 
plaguing this country for ages is 
sti ll present. It's sti ll causing 
pain. 

\ '{e're sup posed to have 
learned something about toler-
ance by now. We're supposed to 
have learned how to accept peo-
ple for who they are. We're sup-
posed to have learned enough 
about individual freedom that we 
wou ld never violate someone 
else's freedom si mpl y because we 
don't agree with his or her point 
of view. 

But we haven't. We haven't 
learned a damn thing. We sti ll 
refuse to let people be who they 
are, to let people be free. We still 
label, stereotype and discriminate. 
Despite all o ur technological 
adva nces and economic success, 
despite the new inventions and the 
"heightened" tandards of living, 
things are still the same. Hatred 
still lives. We haven't changed a 
bit. 

Iraq: Bush appeals to voters' fears, not needs

th ey wercn't pressure!+' to sud -
d<:nly fear Saddam IIus ein . 
\ Vhen vote rs :lrc pushed into 
fe:l r, the\' can become rea c-
tio nary a~d ill ogical. 

Accurdi ng ly, the following 
becomes clear. \Nhether or not 
we go to ')'at with Iraq isn't the 
most perti nent issue. This is made 
clear by the wavering of policy 
and enthusiasm toward the war. 
The most important issue is that 
Bush get hi s domestic agenda 
through Congress, now that they 
are so strongly encouraged to 
support the president in this time 
of crisis. 

Democrats and Republicans 
alike have been pressured into 

supporting Bush because he politi-
cized the war. Senate Majority 
Leader Tom Daschle was right to 
scold him on this. But judging by 
recent popularity polls, it seems 
that U.S. society has accepted this 
patriotic-unpauiotic dichotomy as 
sensible. 

Thus Democratic congress-
men and women (especia lly those 
facing re-election this fall) are 
currently too scared' to oppose 
the president o n his agenda . 
Bush 's ability to scare th e 
American public with Saddam's 
(non-existent) nuclear weapons 
all ows him to force the public 
into a reactionary, conservative 
menta Ii ty. 

ft is a dangerous time for civil 
rights right now. Liberties are 

being pushed aside in the name of 
na tional security. [ncreases in 
spending are being approved as 
voters worry about impending 
war. Bur before we sign away our 
rights and our tax dollars, we 
need to look :It what is going on 
behind the scenes of the Bush 
administration's alleged ly noble 
causes. 

T his isn't about war with Iraq 
or the possibility of North Korea 
having nuclear weapons. It 's 
about protecting our rights as 
well as our country and being 
able to uust that we 're getting 
the enti re story from our presi-
dent. Most importantly, it 's 
about seeing beyond the smoke 
screen, and being able to know 
the truth . 

Pro: Davis h as defended Californians 
continued from page 4 

harmful elllissions without hiking 
vehicle or gas taxes or putting lim-
It<nions on miles driven or vehicle 
ownership. 

While business leaders like 
Bob Epstein of Sybase applauded 
the ~ I glling of the bi II, Davi 
>igncd It in the face of oi l compa-
nies and the .luto industry tl13t 
ca n't luuk heyond immediate prof-
its. Davis' courage in the face of 
pressure from these enormously 
wcalthy and powerful forces show 
that he's not a panderer and is 
ca pable of working toward solu-
tions to benetit hoth the environ-
ment :lnd business. 

Davis h'15 also failed to be 
IIltimiriated by another Golia th -
thl! gun industry. According to 
press releases, SB 682 and AB 496 
"make California the tirst state in 
tht! nation to repeal the pecial 
immunity privil eges granted to 
gun makers." Under current law, 
gu n man ufacturing is the only 
industry that is exempt from prod-
lICt lialJllity bw uits, meaning that 
even if a gunmaker is grossly neg-
ligenr, it can't be held account-
able. 0 marter how tightly peo-
ple cling to their right to bear 

arms, they cannot deny the sense 
of holding a !,'l.ln manufacnlrer 
responsible if gross negligence 
causes the death of a loved one. 

In the realm of issues directly 
relating to UCSD, Davis has 
been a friend of stem cell 
research - but not toO friendl y, 
since it 's important to set regula -
tions on a powerful technology 
with a large potential to be taken 
into the rea lm of the creepy and 
u nn atural. The White House 
limited stem cell research so dra-
matically it crippl ed biotech 
research in Califo rnia, but SB 
253 authorizes stem cell research 
from any source, including 
human embryonic stem cells, that 
is reviewed by an approved insti -
tlltional review board. Rath er 
than indiscri minately limiti ng the 
sources of stem cells, this bill 
allows intell igent decisions to be 
made about potenti al SOurces for 
research that could help 128 mil-
lion Americans battle ai lments 
ranging from cancer to 
Parkin on's disease to arthritis . 

Contrast the courage Davis has 
shone in 200 2 alone with his 
Republican opponent, Bill Simon, 
who, despite being a rich busi-

nessman, is running a bumbling, 
cash-strapped qmpaign. 

lIe reversed in a heartbeat his 
promise to back gay marriage 
when his conservative supporters 
objected. Thc pressure of conser-
vativ06 to oppose equal right for 
gays is understandably constant 
and intense, but its a politician's 
job not to cave to thi kind of 
pressure, just like it's a judge's 
ri gh t to, rul e accord i ng to the b IV 
and the law only. Simon simply 
doesn 't have the morals or the will 
to go against special-interest 
groups and follow any sort of 
meaningful agenda. ~ stated by 
the Los Angdrs 7i7llU, his entire 
campaign is marked by the fact 
that, "wherever he was, whomever 
he talked [0, whatever questions 
were asked, he would smile and 
repeat, over and over again, two 
things, without getting into 
details: He was going to c<u t taxes 
and fix the budget, education and 
infrastructure." Well , any moron 
can say that - detai l and vision 
are what cou nts. And the man 
with the vision and the details is 
Davis, a man who i much more in 
line with California values than

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
LGBT article points to 

some peculiarities 
Editor: 

I found the article regarding the 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, 
Transgender Alliance in some ways 
informative, in some ways humor-
ous, and in a few instances trou-

~Iing. It is always good to know 
that students of various orienta-
tions and opinions are trying to 
open their minds to different per-
spectives. It was som~what humor-
ous to read a quote from a student 
regarding hislher coming out as, 
'~ liberating," and that being who 
he/she is "without having to hold 
back" fee ls good even though the 
quote was signed, "Anonymous." 
Am I the only one who sees the 
irony in this? 

Troubling were the comments 
regarding heterosexism and homo-
phobia. Is it really oppressive to ask 
if somcone has a girlfriend or 
boyfriend? Is it still safe to ask 
whether or not someone owns a 
dog, or would that offend cat own-
ers) And it certainly isn't an odd 
thing to ask a man if he has a girl-
friend because the vast majority of 
men are straight. It seems a safe 
attempt at small talk to me. 

As for homophobia, what many 
still fail to grasp is that a great deal 
of people still see homosexuality as 
morally repugnant. These people 
aren't intolerant, homophobic or 
unenlightened as some would sug-
gest; they simply have a belief. 
Branding those ind ividuals homo-
phobes, which many in the LGBT 
communi ty would do, truly does 
create a hostile 
environment. Acting as if the mil-
lions that held that opinion were 
simply ignorant in no way exhibits 
open-mindedness. Tolerance is a 
two-way street necessi tating bOtil 
sides to open up to a dif(erent per-

• 

spective, even one that might say 
homosexuality is wrong.

his article on OCt. 14, titled "UC

tively highlighted political and mi l-
itary grounds for U.S. and general 
support to Israel, the grounds for

an unwaverin g commitment ro

Me (thinking that won't happen 

until he stops eating sand): "Wow, 
that's reall t' great!" 

Nicky (ealing sand): "I already 
have the handcuffs, too. I .practice 
usi ng them al l the time at home." 
(pause) "You know where I got 
them?" 

Now, at this point a whole 
bunch of possible answers came to 
mind . A toy shop. One of those 
machines where you stick a quarter 
in and get the one prize you didn't 
\Vant. An arcade. 

Me (trying to remember that I 
get paid for this shit) : "Where'd 
you get them?" 

Nicky (WilY too proud of him-
sel/): "From under my mom's bed ." 

OK. Wasn't expecting tbat par-
ticular answer. 

Now, at this point, it is very 
important that I not scar this child 
for life by being completely horri-
fied that not only does his mom 
keep sex toys under her bed, but that 
her child knows about them. I must 
remain cool, calm and collected. 

Me (very cool , calm and collect-
ed): "What?!?!" 

Nicky (too into that sand to 

notice my shock): "Under my mom's 
bed. But don 't tell her, cause she 
doesn 't know I know they're there." 

Don't worry; I won't say a thing. 
Now, like I said, I know icky's 

mom . To be politically correct 
about it, she's a divorced blonde 
with the biggest breast implants 
I've ever seen in real li fe . 

So I pretty much al ready know 
that she has sex. 

What I dilbl't know was that she's 
also a kinky amateur dominatrix. 
And I didn 't wa7lt to know it, really. 
(Note: If you too are a kinky amateur 
dominatrix, please keep it to yourself 
- at least unol you're no longer an 
amateur. I mean, come on.) 

Nicky (obviously thirsty from 
all that sand he just ate): "Can I go 
get a drink of water)" 

Me (genuinely calm now) : 
"Sure. Go with a buddy." (As a 
counselor, I have to say that after 
pretty much everything.) 

Now tell me that im', the scari -
est story you'll hear this 
Halloween. 

So basically, we need to make it 
illegal to keep sex toys within two 
miles of children . Take it from a 
fonner camp counselor: They'll be 
a lot less terrifying after we do.

Shuttle service deserves applause 
System's kinks don 't compare to conven ience 

By EVELYN HSIEH 
Contributing writer 

On the list of things we take 
ror granted here at CSD, the 
shuttle system would probabl y be 
nea r the tOp . G ranted, there's 

pl~ nty to bellyache about regard-
ing transportation and parking, 
especially the la tter. 

Yes, the parking is ridiculously 
expensiv~, the Cityshu ttl es are 
ru nning over capacity and the 
Capus Loop Shuttles run a little 
late once in a while. Blit despite 
these flaws, the shuttle system 
remains an admirable and effective 
attempt at easing the problems of 
getting to and around school. In 
fact, ridership has steadily been 
increasing from year to year. 

According to the UCSD 
Transportation Web si te, all of last 
year 's shuttles had some 700,000 
passengers, with about 3,000 riders 
a day on the Campus Loop Shunle 
and 5,500 a day on Regents. The 
parking fee and citation revenue-
funded shunle svstem still offers a 
needed assistance without costing 
students a fare . While the trans-
portation at UCSD is by no means 
ideal, the shuttle system is an 
extremely valuable and essential 
service at this school. 

The all-new Cityshuttl e may be 
experiencing growing pains, but it 
still provides an indispensable ser-
vice to all UCSD affiliates. 
Cityshunle is the spotlight mode of 
transportation this year. T he shut-
tle, in theory, allows off-campus 
studen ts to ski p the hassle of dri-
ving to school. That hassle includes 
not having to pay some $400 annu-
ally to roam around full parking 
lots and stalk people walking to 

CAMPUS 
their cars in search fo r a sacred "S" 
spot. 

G ranted, the new shuttle route 
has had its share of problems - it 
frequently runs over capacity, sub-
sequently bypassing stops along the 
way, and seemingly, even at ten-
minllte intervals, doesn't come 
often enough. Nevertheless, it's 
cringe-worthy to envision what the 
situation would be if Cityshuttles 
stopped operating. 

Following the limitation of"S" 
spots this yea r, the alternative of 
public transportation is more 
important than ever. Not only 
does the Cityshuttle transport off-
campus residents to their respec-
tive apartments and condos, but 
also allows on-campus kids with-
out cars easy access to Ralphs, 
movie theatres, the mall and other 
student-saturated havens. 

Although students often have to 
get .:ozy in the standing-room-only 
shuttles (especially during peak 
hours in the morning and early 
evening), it is far more efficient 
than looking for a spot and paying 
for the right to do so. Additionally, 
it reduces pollution and congestion 

on the sueets in and around cam-
pus. Of course, it Isn't pleasant 
waiting in the cold or to have to 
stand up on the shuttle afrer a long, 
hard day, but these ki nds of prob-
lems are inherent in almost any 
mass-uansport:ltion system. 

This being the inaugural ye:lr 
of the Cityshutde, glitches and 
limited capaCIty is all but expected. 
As UCSD's population continues 
to increase, this quandary will no 
doubt be brought up as uans-
portation concerns are voiced. 

According to some riders, the 
overcrowding of the shuttles also 
has spawned tl1e equally problem-
atic issue of bypassing stops along 
the way. Due to the sheer number 
of riders in the vehicle, the shunle 
is forced to drive past designated 
stops, causing unfortunate stu-
dents to wait for the next one and 
possibly infringi ng on tight sched-
ules. T he problem is compounded 
by the fact that the city buses have 
been known to pass students as 
well, not real izing that the 
Ci tyshuttles behind them are 
al ready bursting wi th students. 

This gli tch in planning and 
communication can be assuaged 
in due time if more shuttles are 
added to compensate. The more-
established city buses, which are 
not run by UCSD but are also 
free of charge with a sticker, can 
work in ta ndem with the 
Cityshuttles to help deal .vith the 
overcrowding predicament. 

Though imperfect, the 
Cityshuttle is a well-intentioned 
idea wi th somewhat shakier exe-
cution. It deserves accolades fo r 
its vision, which finally recognizes 
the increasing problems of park-
ing, traffic and excessive griping.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, ocrOBER 2B , 2002 

Crime: Many sexual assaults go unreported 
continued from page / 

ronment. 
Many of the crime statistics 

over the past three years have 
remained relatively stable . For 
example, incidents of motor vehi· 
cle theft, arson and sex offenses by 
forcc have not experienced a 
notable drop or g:lin in frequency. 
The number of serious offenses 
reported such as murder, 
manslaughter or hate crimes o n 
and around campus is virtually 
zero. 

Crime statistics reported to the UCSD Police 
Statistics include crimes that were reported on campus, in residential life 
buildings and in reasonab~ contiguous areas to the university. 

"These numbers show that the 
UCSD campus is a comparatively 
safe place to be," UCSDPD 
Sergeant Bob Jones said. "In rela· 
tion to the city of San Diego, 
being on campus is dramatically 
safer. " 

The crime statistics are orga· 
nized into charts, which span the 
three years prior to the report's 
publication: 1999,2000 and 200 1. 

The statistics are also divided 
into four reporting locations: on 
campus; on-campus residential 
life buildings; non-campus prop· 
erty, including the La Jolla Del 
Sol Apartments, the D elta 
Gamma and Sigma Chi houses; 
and public property, which con-
cerns the area around campus, 
includi ng Genesee Avenue, 
Torrey Pines Road and La J olla 
Shores Drive. 

"1 beli cve that security is pretty 
tight at and around UCSD," said 
Jay Luo ng, a Reve ll e College 
junior. "It see ms like any theft or 
crime that happens on campus is a 
big deal because it rarely hap-
pens." " 

Episodes of burglary reported 
to the UCS D Police Department 
over the past three years have sig-
nificantly dropped, falli ng frolll 
63 burglaries in 1999 to 29 in 
2001. In contrast, the number of 
reported burglary offenses 
increased over 10 percent 
throughout the rest of the UC 
system. 

However, episodes of assault 
reported to the UCSD police sig-
nificantly increased. from three 
incidents in t999 to II in 200 I. 

"[Incidents of] sexual offense 
carry the most concern," Jones 

violation 

alcohol offenses 
drugs/narcotics offenses 
motor vehicle theft 
burglary 
aggravated a~ult 
weapon offenses 
sex offenses (force) 
sex offenses (no force) 
arson 

hate crimes 
robbery 
manslaughter 
murder 

sa id. "The numbers - five in 2000 
and four in 2001 - don 't reflect 
what's really going on. We all know 
that sex offenses are underreport-
ed, and we don't want these num-
bers to give anyone a false sense o f 
security. " 

Most prominently document-
ed in the UCSD C lery Report are 
the dramatic increase in offenses 
havi ng to do with drugs and alco-
hol. 

Over the past three years, the 
cumulati ve number of disciplinary 
referra ls for drug and narcotics 
offenses by both the UCSD Police 
Department and other campus 
security authori ties has risen five-
fo ld, skyrocketing from 27 offens-
es in 1999 to 148 offenses in 200 I. 
Arrests for drug and narcotics 
offenses have more than doubled. 

In addition, disciplinary refer-
ral s for alcohol have nearly 
tripled , from 345 incidents in 
1999 to 922 incidents in 200 I . 

UC Berkeley students 
demand tenured prof. 
Tenured Filipino .. American 

studies prof. urged by students 
By KIM MAl-CUTLER 

Daily Californian (UC Berkeley) 
(U·WI RE) BERKELEY, 

Calif. - Approximately 20 cos-
tume-clad UC Berkeley students 
transformed the front of 
Dwinelle Hall into tluee land-
mark moments of anti -FilipillO 
discrimination when they urged 
the university to hire and retain a 
Filipino.American studies profes-
sor. 

The ethnic stud ies depart-
ment placed an advertisement for 
a Filipino-American studies pro-
fessor earlier this month with the 
goal of hiring a tenure-track pro-
fessor who would start in June 
2003. The position will remain 
open until ov. 5. 

Several faculty members from 
the ethnic studies department 
and one sociology graduate snl-
dent will serve on the search 
committee, sa id UC Berkeley 
senior and orga nizer Karmcla 
Herrera. 

Many students performed in 
intermittent "guerrilla theater" 
skits at Dwinelle Plaza on Oct. 
24, surveying a century of dis-
crimination. 

"Its a way of expressing polit-

ical ideas in an artistic manner," 
Herrera said. 

The performance recalled 
Filipinos being caged and exhib· 
ited at the World's Fair in 1904, 
where Filipinos protesting a 
forced eviction in San Francisco 
in the 1950s and how post-Sept. 
II regulations on ai rport security 
screeners have put many Filipinos 
out of work. 

S ta tewide, students have 
mobilized in support of Filipino-
American studies as students have 
orga nized visibility 'weeks at sev-
eral other UC campuses, includ-
ing UC Irvine, UC Riverside and 
UCSD . 

"-The Asian-American studies 
program holds really esteemed 
and famous faculty, yet still 
Asian-American studies is defi-
nitely not complete without 
Filipino-American studies," 
Herrera said, noting Filipino 
Americans are the second-largest 
Asian ethnicity in the United 
States. 

The Asian-American studies 
program has hired lecturers to 
teach courses in Filipino-
American history, and the

Lit dept. explores 
changes to writing 
New head of literature/writing 

section seeks student input 
By LAUREN FERRIS 

Contributing Writer 

Over 20 students gathered in 
the Chancellor's Complex on Oct. 
24 for a meeting to discuss the 
future of the UCSD literature 
deparnnent and more specifically, 
the writing ma jor at UCSD. 

Leading the open discussion 
was Eileen Myles, the new head of 
the 'department's wri ting section 
this year. The purpose of the meet-
ing was to use smdent input to 
begin a dialogue about the current 
sta te of the writi ng section and 
ways it could be improved. 

Myles began by stating that one 
thing she hopes to do this year is 
find a place for writing at UCSD. 
She explained that she wants to 
extend the writing culture to a 
more visible place on campus and 
in the school community at large 
so writing majors to share their 
work. 

Students offered suggestions 
like publishing a journ al for the 
writing program, having public 
readings, more open-mic nights 
and putting more publicity into 
the readi ngs that already take 
place. 

Students at the meeting also 

raised their own suggestions for 
new courses that they would like to 
see added. Ideas included classes in 
journal ism or media writing, philo-
sophical style and instruction on 
how to critique works. 

Myles said she wants to "battle 
the notion that artists and writers 
labor in obscurity, especi,l ll y within 
the UC system." 

Another major improvement 
for the literature department that 
was discussed at the meeting was 
the addi tion of an M.A. in writing. 
The creation of this new degree is 
scheduled to be available in the fall 
of 2002. 

Currently, writing is the largest 
major offered by the department of 
literature. Beginning next quarter, 
there wi ll be a new professor and 
course offered. Amber Brooks is a 
local fiction writer and journalist 
who will be joining the teaching 
staff to instruct a course on adapt-
ing literature into screenplays. The 
class will be offered during the 
winter quarter, but has not yet 
been added to the course cata-
logue. 

More meetings to expa nd on 
the ideas discussed are planned, 
but no dates have been set thus 
far.

has extended to places 
like Colombia, Thailand and 
Burma - countries where politi-
cal amI social upheaval have left 
many of their nation's youth wi th-
out a source of education or place 
to explore their creativity. There, 
AjA provides teacher education, 
participatory photography and 
vocational weaving programs fo r 
chi ldren to help develop their ana-
lytical and communications skills. 

"Our goal is to promote elf-
sufficiency for both the children 
and the community," Ogden said . 
"The project rea lly becomes a 
nexus for the community'S pride." 

The project will be on display 
at Espresso Roma and at the 
Grad uate School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies until 
the end of the month. 

Recently, the AjA Project 
extended its participatory photog-
raphy program to San Diego. The 
From Image to Reality program 
will focus on recently resettled 
refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, 
Somalia and Sierra Leone, and will 
teach the youth the basics of pho-
tography and film development. 

"We hope to engender learn· 
i ng in these kids and hopefully 
promote self-sustaining qualities," 
Ogden said. 

The photographs on display at 
the Cross Cultural Center, Roma 
Cafe and IRIPS are from the 
Colombian Shooting Cameras for 
Peace program, which began in 
Spring 2002 . AjA instructors in 
the village of Bogota, Colombia, 
teach students to use cameras to 
document everyday aspects of 
their lives and analyze the images. 

Themes include memory, the 
future, fairy tales, family and fear. 
Each photograph is accompanied 
by a brief description written by 
the children and translated into 
English. The gallery provides a 
first-hand account to the lives of 
refugees through the eyes of a 
child living in a land of turmoil.

the exhibit. 

The AjA Project received 
tremendous praise and media cov-
erage from Colombian newspa-
pers and television networks for 
its work in Bogota, and similar 
programs are starting up in other 
villages in the country.

needed continuous support for the 
student conununity. 

"Wha t happens is that a class 
is offered by a lecturer, and then 
they have to leave," Herrera said. 
"There's limited faculty interac-
tion. We need to have someone 
to represent us on the facul ty 
leveL" 

Supporters said a permanent 

Filipino-American srudies profes-
sor could serve as a mentor for 
srudents and would be able to 
cover topics such as the Filipino 
diaspora and Filipino-American 
identity. 

UC Berlc.eley senior and orga-
nizer Alynn Vmel said she has had 
to look outside the university for 
trained advisers when writing 
papers on Philipino issues. 

The process for hiring a pro-
fessor starts with the Asian-
American studies program, fol-
lowed by the ethnic studies 
department, then the dean of 
social sciences and on to a budget 

committee, said Ethnic Snldies 
Department Manager Rosa 
Johnson. 

In the past, the ethnic studies 
department has employed two 
Filipino-American studies profes-
sors, who were denied tenure and 
subsequently left, resulting in an 
absence of a FilipinO-American 
studies professor. 

"The process got in the way," 
Student Regent Dexter Ligot-
Gordon said. "We have the stu-
dents' support. T hey understand 
the system and the hiring process, 
and they're not going to let this 
happen again."

lawyers for both sides and admin-
istrators kept count alongside rep-
resentatives from the National 
Labor Relations Board using Palm 
Pilots, notebooks and legal pads. 

While many watched in disbe-
lief until the last vote was count-
ed, some unionization supporters 
left early as the chorus of "no" 
votes was read aloud to the silent 
crowd . 

"['m obviously elated that we 
won, but I know how much time 
and effort [C.A.S.E.IUAW] put 
into this, and our victoty was bit-
tersweet, " said John Sebastian, a 
member of At What Cost, the 
group opposing the unionization 
movement. 

A 51111 exit poll conducted at 
the Mann Libraty and the Straight 
pinned 68 percent of 477 graduate 
students surveyed as voting against 
the union . The actual results 
found that 69.9 percent of sru-
dents cast a "no" vore. 

"If you had asked me in August 
if C.A.S.E.lUAW would win, I 
would have sworn the answer was 
yes," Amanda Holland-Minkley, a 
founder of At What Cost, said 
before the election. "A week ago I 
would have said maybe, but tonight 
I think we have a real chance." 

C.A.S.E.lUAW supporters 
meanwhile had publicly expressed 
complete confidence that they 
would win. "People having a voice 
in their working conditions is the 
right way to go," said Robb Willer, 
a CAS.E./uAW organizer after 

" People having a voice in 
their working conditions is 

the right way to gO" We 
stiU feel that way. " 

- Robb Willer. 
CAS.£./UAW organizer 

the results were announced. "We 
still feel that way." 

In July, Cornell became the 
first university to agree to abide by 
the results of a unionization elec-
tion. Private universi ties such as 
Brown and Columbia are chal-
lenging the right of graduate stu-
dents to unionize in a lawsui t in 
front of the NLRB. 

A "no" vote at Cornell is the 
first significant setback in the 
UAW's nationwide campaign to 

expand student unioniza ti on to 
private universities. Students at 
New York University voted to 
unionize in 2000. 

One researcher of higher edu-
cation, Ronald Ehrenberg, the 
Irving M . Ives professor of indus-
trial and labor relations and eco-
nomics, thinks that the UAW is 
"in this for the long run ." 

"The UAW sees higher educa-
tion more broadly than just gradu-
ate students," he said, citing 
research that shows that 38 per-
cent of full time professors at pub-
lic universities were unionized and 
that 80 percent of faculty national-
ly is in public higher education. 

However, the questions stands: 
Why is Cornell different from 
NYU, where graduate students 
voted in' favor of unionization? 

According to Ehrenberg, 
Cornell graduate students gener-
ally face better job prospects, bet-
ter stipends and a lower cost of liv-
ing than NYU srudents. An addi-
tional consideration is that the 
NYU union doesn't include many 
students in the sciences, 
Ehrenberg said. 

The Cornell union would have 
been second at a private university 
and was already the largest pro-
posed to date.

The Pacific Beach Hare 
Krishna temple serves up 

healthy cuisine 

II hat do Plato, Leonardo da Vinci , Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi , Albert Einstein and Pamela Anderson all have in 
common' These famous personalities all 
chose to be vegetarians, and joining their 
ranks are many students who are involved 
in the Vegetarian Club on campus. 

The club 's main purpose is to provide 
healthy vegetarian food and a place for 
students to meet the diverse assortment of 
people who share their choice. Of course, 
not everyone involved has to be a strict 
vegetarian or vegan; they merely have to 
have an interest in healthy alternatives to 
the fast food culture that surrounds us all. 

The acting president, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College senior Ben Winkler-McCue, who 
is not a vegetarian, was introduced to the 
club by a teaching assistant and has found it 
to be a beneficial organization. 

"It is neat th.at they do this service," 
Winkler-McCue . said. "A lot of people 
appreciate it. This school doesn't have a 
lot of options for people who want to eat 
healthy. " 

" 

T he elderly Prabhupada worked day 
and night translating ancient holy texts 
into Engli sh and taught classes out of a 
small storefront. From there he sent his 
followers throughout ·the world to open 
Krishna-conscious centers, and currently 
there are about 50 Hare Krishna temples 
and 75,000 members in North America. 

All initiated members of the ' movement 
vow to follow four rules to atta in a pure 
life: no gambling, no intoxicants (includ-
ing drugs, liquor, coffee, tea and ciga-
rettes), no illicit sex and no meat. 

Kevin Smith, the college program 
director from the Pacific Beach temple, 
got involved with the Hare Krishnas while 
attending San Diego State University in 
the late '80s. He has been overseeing the 
activities at UCSD for lO years. 

"I started adopting the principles like 
vegetarianism and then the chant, and 
after seeing the positive effect they had, I 
joined the temple," Smith said. 

The diet adopted by the H are Krishnas 
incorporates wholesome foods like fruits, 

grains, vegetables and milk 
Although the student-

run Food Co-Op and the 
Che Cafe offer vegetarian 
menus, the club provides a 
unique opportunity to try 
home-cooked vegetarian 
dishes at their all-you-care-
to-eat buffets each 
Wednesday. On the second 
floor of the Student 
Center, during lunch, stu-
dents can sample as much 
of the cuisine as they desire 
for a small donation. The 
dishes are mainly Indian 
style, and always include a

ety of meal s. They feel 
that such a diet respects 
tile earth and keeps them 
free from the bad ka rma 
created by hurting other 
creatures. 

According to the 
Bhaktivedanta Book Trusts 
Web site, " Devotees of 
Krishna avoid needless vio-
lence. Thev see other crea-
tures as 'spiritual living 
beings. Though these crea-
tures may be less. intell i-

dessert and drink. 
"I think it is the best deal for quality 

and price," said Laura Archer, an assistant 
at Geisel Library. "I think anyone would 
like it, whether vegetarian or not. I love 
th"at the food changes each time. The vari -
ety makes it interesting." 

For many years, the Vegetarian Club 
has worked closely with the Hare Krishna 
temple in Pacific Beach to bring this inter-
esting buffet of vegetarian food to campus 
each week. A vegetarian diet is an integral 
part of their religion , which is an expres-
sion of the ancient Vaishn.ava tradition, a 
monotheistic faith wi'thin Hindu culture. 

"It just feels good to eat food people 
care about when they make it, rather than 
the Price Center where people are just 
being paid minimum wage to do it," 
Winkler-McCue said . 

The Hare Krishna movement, well 
known for seeking donations in airports, 
was started in 1965 when Srila Prabhupada 
arrived in New York City from India to 
spread Krishna consciousness in America. 
Lord Krishna is the supreme deity they 
worship and the name means "all attrac-
tive." He began ro draw followers in 
Tompkins Square Park while he chanted 
"Hare Krishna," which is a mantra to call 
on Krishna's divine energy. 

gent than we, they are also 
God's children, our brothers and sisters. So 
why should we kill them? If a child were to 
kiH a less intelligent brother, do you tlunk 
the father would be pleased?" 

For Hare Krisi-ll1as, the act of cooking 
itself is part of their worship since they 
cook for Krishna 's enjoyment firs t. At their 
temples, Sunday evening feasts are the cul-
mination of their holy day. Such feasts 
were initiated by Prabhupada. Although it 
is affiliated with a religious urganization , 
the group does not push their beliefs in 
exchange for food . 

"I know I was put off initiall y," Archer 
said. "I thought, '[t's the Krishnas, they 
might make me shave my head !' But it is 
nothing to be afraid of, just good food ." 

The Vegetarian Club, in connection 
with the Hare Krishnas, set up booths on 
Library Walk for Earth Day and offered 
food to taste and explanations of the Vedic 
lifestyle. There are also tentative plans to 
bring some traditional Indian cultural 
events to campus. 

"There are several famous dancers in 
the area who perform at the temple who 
would probably be willing to come. And 
some of the kids are great musicians," 
Smith said. "But that may be kind of ambi -
tious. I just need to keep everyone in rice 
and vegetables."

Living on a budget is a necessary, unpleasant reality 
By SAM WI LSON 
Contributing Writer 

\\ 'tth midterms approaching,

L1CS [) offers various types of 
financial .lssistance to students, but 
It'~ still up to each individual to take 
advan tage of them and balance 
their fina nces. 

CJlling a large financial plan-
nmg firm such as Eq uity Planners 
111 Del ,\ br, it becomes apparent 
tha t students are definitely olltside 
the mainstream of fina ncial plan-
ning, with the focus u ually being 
on undertakings like investment, 
mortgage structuring and retire-
Im:nt planning. 

The unique position of the stu-
de nt is that they are the one 
de mographic besides reti rees who, 
even in ideal situations, usually 
spend a great deal more money 
tha n they earn. The main ques-
tion answered by the financial 
planning profess ion i , "What do I 
do with all this money'" - a 
ques tion not often asked by stu-
de nts. As an extension of this 
logic, students are less likely to 
have the cash to fork over to a 
highly paid planner. On the ot her 
h,1nd, the financial aid office can 
be extremely helpful in a rra~ging 
the diverse sources of loan, schol-
arship and gra nt money that sup-
plement a student's income. 

The average total student loan 
for a UCSD graduate is $13 ,500, 
which is lower than many universi-
ties. 

"The fees have been relatively 
steady over the past six or seven 
yea rs, although housing costs have 
increased," said Vincenr De Anda, 
head of the fina ncial aid office. 

These loans are relatively easy 
to come by, and there is no credi t 
check since the government 
ensures the loans if there is a finan-
cial need. 

John's Wisdom -by Don Zembrosky 

"Start early," Dc Anda said. 
"It's kind of late by the time they 
are here to do much besides find-
ing grants and appl ying for a 
loan." 

T hi s advice is perhaps better 
passed on to a sister in junior high 
than mulled over regretfully while 
filling out Stafford loan forms. 

Almost two-thirds of students 
at UCSD ho ld jobs while taking 
classes . Phyllis Walker, an 
employee of the Career Services 
Center, says that the pay scale for 
on-campus student jobs ranges 
from the minimum wage of $6.75 
up to as much as $20 per hour for 
some Web designers and students 
with high-level lab skills. Besides 

driving the shuttl e, another job 
that consistently pays over $10 an 
hour without many technical skill 
requirements is tutoring through 
the "America E.eads/ America 
Counts" program. 

"Look for jobs near the begin-
ning of each quarter, " Walker said . 
"All the departments try to fill 
vacancies at around this time." 

The financial aid office does 
offer a link to a Web site, 
www.wrb'Wise.org, where students 
ca n calculate their budgets and get 
tips on living economically. 
Filling out expenditures on 
clothes, textbooks, transporta tion 
and other expenses can be a sober-
ing and humbling experience, but

All bu t one of the students 
interviewed said that they carried .1

their credit cards, the nemesis of 
the financial aid office. T he interest 
accrued from these balances put a 
serious strain on some students' 
monthly budgets. Eating our was 
mentioned by all sUldents as the 
single biggest money trap. 

Creative solutions offered by 
s tudents to save a small nest egg 
include having school expenses 
deducted frolll payc hecks and 
establishing a se para te savi ngs

Student financial management 
is nowhere near as complicated as 
investing, much less organic chem-
istry. With a little foresight, a 
whole lot of boring self-restraint 
and perhaps a nice slice of bor-
rowed cash , most sUldents should 
be able to balance their checkbook 
without the aid of a professio nal. 
Besides, those expensive counseling 
fees could be better spent on plen-
ty of other things, like a three-
pound box of granola bars, a bus 
pass and a gallon jug of chlorine 
bleach.

Beyond 'The Pill' 
Student Health Services offers 
women new contraceptive options 

By RUTH KOC;EN 
Contributing Writer 

Thirty people struggling to roll 
condoms onto brown spotted 
bananas is the image that is com-
monly rela ted to sex ed, but that 
doesn't happen at the Sexual 
Health Info Session at Student 
Health Services. The Women's 
Clinic offers low-cost gynecologi-
cal ex.ams, pregnancy testing, sexu-
ally transmi tted diseases screenings 
and e mergency contraception to 
students. 

"Al l of the staff members are 
female, and exams are always com-
pl etely confidential , even for stu-
dents under 18," said Suzanne 
Ward, manager of the Women's 
Clinic and nurse practitioner with a 
specialty in fami ly planning and/or 
gynecology. 

According to Planned 

ular form of birth control was the 
Intrauterine Device. The IUD is a 
small object containing copper that 
is inserted into the uterus to pre-
vent pregnancy. These can last one 
to 10 years arid are 99 percent 
effective. Because IUDs must be 
inserted and removed by a doctor 
and the process can be painful , th ey 
have has become less popular; 
Student Health Services does not 
offer this option, either.

34 Bedouin , e.g. 
36 Anglo-Saxon theologian 
39 Slander in print Parenthood, 85 percent of women 

who use no contraceptives during 
intercourse become pregnant each 
year. There are many new forms of 
birth control avai lable that make it 
easy to avoid this situation . 

Currently, the most popular 
hormonal birtil control method is 
the pill . To prevent STDs and TO 
avoid accidental pregnancy, "cou-
ples should always use a back-up 
method with hormonal contracep-
tion," Ward said. Oral contracep-
tives are 98 percent effective with 
perfect use, yet it is often difficult 
for women to remember to take 
them at the same ti me every 
day. Now t1lere are several new 
hormonal devices that eliminate 
this inconvenience. 

One familiar option is to get an 
injection of medications like Depo-
Provera and Lunelle, which con-
tain hormones like those found in 
the pill. Depo-Provera is slightly 
older and only has to be adminis-
tered every three 
months. However, many women 
experience side effects with this 
treatment, and all women have to 
wait 18 months after their final 
injection to be able to have a child 
again.

they have the benefit of offering

that male condoms do. The female 
condom is available at most of the

Health: Patch and ring offer 
new alternatives to injections 

continued from page 13 
- out of 782 women, none became 
pregnam during a clinical study-
and has the potential to become 
the most effective form available. 
However, Lunelle recently issued a 
recall on all prefilled syringes. If 
you think you may be affected, 
begin using a barrier method and 
contact your ' doctor or visit 
7Il7UW.lzmfl/e.com. 

If the thought of injections 
makes you quinn, and the pill 
seems too inconvenient, there are 
two new devices that promise to 
eliminate both of these 
problems. The tir t is the ring, a 
flexible, transparent, two-inch cir-
c1c that contain hormones similar 
to those in the pill. 

"The ring will be interesting," 
Ward said. Although this option 
will not be available until January, 
some complain that the ring can be 
easily displaced and can cause vagi-
nal infections. Time will tell 
whether it catches on or not. 

In addition, Ortho-Evra has just 
released a hormonal patch that can 
be worn on a variety of inconspicu-
ous body parts. You replace the 
patch every week for tl1ree weeks at 
a time, and then go one week with-
out it. Though they are currently 
only manufactured in beige, the 
company expects to introduce 
other colors, including 
clear. Clinical tests have shown that 
the patch is 99 percent effective 
and costs about the same as oral 
contraceptives. 

Though these new hormonal 
devices may be more convenient 
and more foolproof than previous 
methods, the side effects remain 
similar; a person thar experiences 
side effects with the pill may not 
find the ring or· the patch any dif-
ferent. This is because the hor-

mohes that these devices carry are 
the same as oral contraceptives, 
just delivered in a different way and 
in different dosages. 

When asked which birth con-
trol method she recommends 
most, Ward said, "I'm not in the 
business of recommending any-
thing. I'm here to dispel myths," 
and suggested that curious Stu-
dents should attend the sexual 
health information sessions and 
make appointment at the clinic. 

Though future products for 
women mirror what is currently 
available, science is working 
toward creating male birth conn'ol 
to transform what has been a pri-
marily female responsibility into 
one for both members of a 
couple. The World Health 
Organization and a clinical study in 
Italy are testing the effect of syn-
thetic testosterone injections and 
pills on sperm count. R esearch also 
suggests that a version of human 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
may be useful in creating a new 
unisex implant. 

"Eventually, there should be 
something for everybody," Ward 
said.

horoscope 
By LINDA C. BLACK 
Tribune Media Services 

Aries (March 21-April 19) : 
Be patient with someone you 

love very much. Include his or her 
concerns in your planning. You 
don't want to do something si lly or 
wrong - you would never hear 
the end of it. 

Taurus (April 20-May 20): 
Keep at it, even if feelings get 

hurt. Feelings are important, of 
course, but they shouldn 't be the 
deciding factor. Apologize, then 
get back to the facts. 

Gemini (May 2 1-June 21): 
You're testing some of your lim-

its. This is good. It's a sign of 
expansion. You're getting too big 
for a box that used to be quite cozy. 
Prepare to step out. 

Cancer (June 22-July 22): 
There's not enough money to 

do what you want. So what else is 
new? Tllis isn't forever; it's just a 
delay. I t's also motivation. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22): 
Can you defeat a stubborn 

adversary? Only with help from a 
friend . Build a good, practical 
argument and stick to it. Logic 
might pr.evail over emotion. 

Virgo (Aug. 23 -Sept. 22): 
If you're stuck, perhaps it's 

because you're receiving conflict-
ing orders. You can't serve two or 
three different masters. Let them 
work it out before you proceed. 

Libra (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): 
You can do a favor. Ask around. 

Somebody is getting really upset, 
faili ng at a task you could do easily. 
Offer your services and make a 
friend for life. 

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): 
You may notice that it's more 

difficult to get what you're going 
after. You may have to make do 
with something you already have. 
This could eventually work to your 
benefit. 

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 2 1): 
It sure would be fun to race off 

and do wild, crazy things, but it 
wouldn't be smart. You may have 
already figured that our. Stand 
firm. 

. Capricorn (Dec. 22 -J an . 19): 
If anybody can figure out how 

to manage the system, it's you. You 
ClIO put away plenty for the funire 
by using creativity and imagination 
now. 

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): 
It's OK if somebody doesn't 

agree with you, as long as your 
objectives are achieved. That's also 
what's best for the whole group, of 
course. 

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20):_ 
Things aren't going smoothly, 

but don't be dismayed. Tile delays 
aren't really your fault. Seems like 
everyone has one more thing to 
say. Wait until they get it all 
worked out.

must,wln games looming ahead. 

continued from page 20 
in dlC ~econd half when me Tri tons 
fought to keep the Coyotes from 
pull ing off a comeback. 

Krupansl1' scored me decisive 
goal for me Tritons in dle 70th 
mi nute off a rebOlmd by CSUSB 
goalie Joseph Ku.lm to increase dle 
lead to 3 -1. T he Coyotes added 
another goal 10 minutes later, bur 
the unyielding and aggressive Triton 
defense was able to hold CSUSB off 
and secure a much-needed \\~ n to 
keep UCSD 's playoff hopes alive. 

This victory is especially sweet 
for the five seniors bidd ing fa rewell 
to UCS D : Chil es, co-captai n 
Bobby Saadati , Burke Fathy, Tyler 
Girimorue and Derek Orchard. 

"I am so happy we won tonight; 
[wi rming] was my only goa l. 1 did not 
fee l any pressure at al l. \Ne just need 

to keep this same intensity in the 
next two g:lInes to make the play-
offs," sa id C hiles, who had an assist 
to go with his goal in the game. 

Wim a record o f 9-5 overall and 
a 7-5 CCAA record, the second-
place Tritons mu st now look ahead 
to their las t twO games o f the sea-
son against Cal Poly Pomona on 
Oct. 29 and G rand Canyon 
University on Nov. 2. Cal Poly 
Pomona currently holds the top 
spot in the South Division, and 
UCS D must win its last twO in 
order to ensure a berth into the 
CCAA postseason. 

"r am pleased with the resul ts. 
T his sets up the big game for us on 
[Oct. 29 against Cal Poly Pomona]," 
UCSD head coach D erek 
AIIl1SO'ong said. "It is a must-win sit-

u~ltion, It is up to the boys ."

O 'Donnell in 3Bth place. 

Though the teams' outcomes 
were disappoin ting, according to 
Van Arsdale, there were still 
tan dam performances, including 

the run turned in by Sung, whose 
ma rk was a school record. 

"Ir's the fastes t 6K time we!Ye 
ever had in our school history," 

\~n Arsdale said . "She ran what 
we prepped fo r. Unfortunately for 
our team, it wasn't enough." 

Sung was not the only one who 
earned praise from her coach. 

"Lilli an really took care of her 
responsibili ty," Van Arsdale said . 
"[Cross] has steadily moved from 
early fall until now and earned her 
way oruo the 'A' squad . She's kept 
her mind on what we're trying to 
do wi th th is team." 

C hico State upended four-time 
defendi ng women 's champion UC 

Da~s for its first ever CCAA con-
ference title by a final score of 48-
55. 

E.ach runn er is awarded a point 
value equal to their fin ish, and the 
p inr tota ls for the top five run-
ners for every team are ad ded to 
calculate the total team score, with 
the lowes t total crowning the 
champion. 

The top five Wildcat runners 
were all among the top 12 finish-
ers. Previously unranked Cal 
State Stanislaus snuck up on the 
field , finishing third among II 
squads with 91 points, and 
UCSD totaled 106 points to 
improve on last yea r 's fifth -pl ace 
showing. 

"Chico epitomizeCl the pro-
gram that I know we will be," Van 
Arsdale said . "They went at the 
race on both sides to win and they 
weren't afraid to lose in doing 
that." 

Neil Kalra was the top per-
former for the Triton men, finish-
ing lOth out of 49 runners to earn 
All-CCAA honors for the first time. 

Narrowly missing out an Al I-
Conference award was Carl 
Lostrom, who finished 16th with a 
time of 25 :58.50. Following were 
Tov Fisher-Kirshner (20th), a 
cold-stricken David Dunbar 
(23rd), John Morrison (24th), 
Alan Shapiro (25th) and Devin 
Callister (29th) to round out the 
top-seven VCSD finishers. 

"[Kalra] raced the way the rest 
o f our team will race me next time 
out," Van Arsdale said. "All-con-
ference honors for him - we 
haven't had that in three years. 
Tov, like Kara, has moved up the 
ranks. He and Carl together really 
helped pick up for the other guys 

who were really flat." 
The men's team, who placed 

third last year, fini shed with 9 1 
team points, two behind Cal State 
Stanislaus for third place among 
six teams. Chico State, with four 
of the six best marks, had equal 
success in the men's race, defeat-
ing four-time defending men 's 
champion UC Davis, 28-39, for its 
first-ever CCAA title. . 

The team will look to have a 
better showing at the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division II West Regionals at 
Woodward Park in Fresno, Calif., 
on Nov. 2. From there, the top 
three teams will advance to me 
NCAA Division II National 
Championships at Ashland 
University in Ohio on Nov. 23 . In 
addition to the top three teams, 
the top two individual runners 
from the regional who are not on 
qualifying teams will earn national 
championship berths, as Dunbar 

. did in 2000. 
"Their emotion al and psycho-

logical status has been oriented 
towards regionals," Van Arsdale 
said . " I expect they will be willing 
to work as a unit and accept their 
roles on the team. We just need a 
little luck as far as me health goes, 
and if we maintain the basics, we' ll 
be there where it counts in me 
end ."

Soccer: Tritons close out 
home schedule with victory

was there and scored the third and 
final goal o f me night at 73 :25. 

Five minutes later, UCSD 
defender M olly Carlson went 
down after a colli s ion with a 
Coyote. She came out of the game 
minutes later. but did not suffer 
any serious injuries. Cal State San 
Bernardino forward Michell e 
Lopez had the last attempt to score 
at th e 8B:60 mark when Triton 
sophomore goalkeeper J ami e 
Lautenschleger left the goal open . 
Fortllllately for the Tritons, the 
attempt was wide and the Coyotes 
did not score. 

Cal State San Bernardino's 
Hernandez played the who le game, 
making two saves and allowing the 
three goals. UCSD's starting goal-
keeper, junior Kami Poma, played 
to the 73:25 mark, making one 
save, and Lautenschleger, her 
replacement, also allowed no goals 
in the combined shutout. 

Despi te a score of 3 -0, mis was a 
hard-fought win. Having played 
me Coyotes once early in the sea-
son , UCSD head coach Brian 
McManus knew that winning on 
me game would be no walk in me 
park. 

"Last ti me we played [San 
Bernardino], we sneaked a 1-0 
win," McManus said . "San 
Bernardino dominated in me first 
15 minutes of play. If they had 

scored dur ing th at time, they 
probably wo uld have wo n th e 
game by two, even three poi nts. 
They definitely played tll e whole 
game." 

Kwon was arguabl y the mos t 
valuab le player of the gmne.Her 
two goal gave UCSD the cushion 
they needed to secure a win. \.vith 
one assist, Harrelson constantly 
challenged the Coyotes to play 
their best . Carlson and mid fi elder 
Erica Porter tea med up to put the 
ball into optimal pla y, which helped 
th e rest of the team shutout the ,,;s-
itors. 

The Tritons next pla y Cal Poly 
Pomona on Oct. 29. A win wo uld 
give UCSD a berth in tile playoffs 
with a first-place standing in the 
division. Cal Poly Pomo na is C\l1' -
rently second in the di~sion, o nly 
one game behind (]CSD. If the 
Tritons lose, they would h~lVe to 
win the following game aga inst' 
Grand Canyon University on Nov. 
2 to clinch the wi ld card spot. 

The last home game is also 
Senior Night, which honors T riton 
seniors who are playing their last 
game at UCSD. This year, the lone 
senior is mid fielder Lauren Jaco bs. 
In her four years of playing, Jacobs 
played in 73 games, scored 14 goal s 
and had six assists. She graduates 
this year from Eleanor Roosevelt 
College with a degree in human 
development.

Tritons win ninth straight 
Volleyball beats Eagles and Toros at home 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women 's volleyball team played its best 
match of the season when it dominated Cal State Los 
Angeles on Oct. 23, followed by a lriton corne back ~c­
tory over an extremely overmatched Cal State . 
Dominguez Hills team two days later to move into a 
tirst-pl ace tie in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. 

Coming into me match, me Tritons (19-3 overall, 
13 -2 CCAA) carried a seven-match winning streak, but 
the Golden Eagles of CSULA carried a five-game 
streak of their own, including a win over previously 
undefeated Cal State San Bernardino. 

T he first point of the match was the result of a kill 
from UCSD's Bonnie Wilson - me first of her team-
high 21 on the nigh t - and set the tone for what was 
to come. The Tritons rolled through CSULA in game 
one (30-23), wim Stacy Dunsmore piclcing up three 
consecutive aces to put the game out of reach. 

After playing poorly the pre~ous weekend, Wilson 
talked about what it took to come back with a big match. 

"Everybody has their bad days, and you've got to put 
them behind you, and thats what I tried to do. I got so 
much encouragement from all my teammates, and mey 
Irnew I played badly," Wilson said. "I looked to them 
and they helped me through it, and in practice I worked 
harder and just thought, 'I have to do better next time. '" 

Anna MacMuldo/Guardion 
Solid defense: Freshman Robin Parlette returns a CSU DH 
serve as Bonnie Wi lson and the Tritons' bench looks on . 

Behind Wilson 's strong performance, VCSD used a 
high level of energy and contagious good play in game 
two to win 3D-lB. The Tritons attacked at an astonish-
ing .515 percentage and had 18 kills, while committing 
only one attacking error. 

McFarland started five different players man he. had 
twO nights before in an attempt to develop depth. The 
Triton second string had no trouble dispatching the 
Taros in just 75 minutes (30-23 , 30-18, 30-25). 

Freshmen Brianna Ki:>che and Francesca Centofanti 
led the team with .13 and 11 kills, respectively, wim 
Koche attacking an unheard-of .611 for the match. 
Setter Jessica Bartter had 34 assists, eight digs and 
three blocks while guiding me Tritons to me victory 
over outclassed CSUDH. 

Despite the solid offense, it was the defense mat 
starred in the third game. CSULA got out to an early 
lead that grew to as many as five points. Not to be 
denied, me Triton block intensified and the players in 
back picked up crucial digs to keep UCSD close. The 
highlight of the match occurred midway through me 
game when Golden Eagle star Dana Coffey was denied 
three consecutive times in spectacular fashion by 
Triton Denelle Smalley on a point mat brought the 
crowd to its feet in thunderous applause and pushed 
the Tritons on to a 30-25 ~ctory. 

Despite the lack of competitive volleyball, the 
UCSD players tried to make good use of me time. 

"It's good for our team because we have a lot of 
depth , and that way people are ready to go when we're 
in tight situations," Koche said. 

Smalley later commented on how she pulled off 
such an impressive string, 

McFarland agreed that getting to exercise his depth 
and allowing for time to work on new things were valu-
able uses of the opportuni ty. 

"Apparendy, I own [Coffey] right now. [ could see 
her, our bloclcers were putting up a real clean block, 
and that's something we work on in practice all me 
time, and so tonight we finally got it," Smalley said. 
"Being in me right spot is the hard part. Getting it up 

"We knew that these guys were struggling, and we 
still wanted to get something out of the match, and we 
did," he said. "We played a lot of people and got some 
practice in some areas that we really hadn 't been able 
to work on." 

isn't as hard as it might look. " . 
Nothing was hard, or even gave the appearance of 

being so, on Oct. 25 as the Tritons hosted Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. UCSD head coach Duncan 

Wim all of their skills freshly polished, the Tritons 
will travel to Cal Sate San Bernardino for a showdown 
on Nov, I, wim tile winner taking sale possession of 
first place in th e CCAA. 

Huckjam: Tour combines sports and music 
concinU/!d from page 20 

"Mat Hoffman, Tony [Hawk] 
and I used to do demos in Santa 
Rosa every year," said Andy 
MacDonald, a seven-time X-
Games gold medalist in skate-
boarding. "We always thought that 
we could take this to a whole new 
level, but nobody had the means to 
do it. Because of the sales of a cer-
tain video game, Tony has the 
means to do it now. It's great to be 
a part of it. " 

San Diego is known as a hotbed 
for the sports showcased on the 
tour. For Hawk and others who 
reside in the area, me San Diego 
stop on the tour was a sort of 
homecoming: 

"I got to do my home show in 
Oklahoma," said H offman, who is 
nicknamed the "Condor." "For a 
lot of the guys, thi s is their home 
show. It's one of the most nerve-
racking shows you do. If you mess 
up, your family and friends are the 
first ones to call it." 

Hawk didn't disappoint the 
hometown crowd in me near-full 
Sports Arena. During the Devo 
Jam Session, which was a free-for-
all for the athletes, Hawk pulled a 
900 after several failed attempts 
and the hometown crowd on its 
feet. For MacDonald, moves like 
that make this show stand Out from 
the competition. 

"Falling's part of me show," 
said MacDonald, a San Diego res-
ident. "We'll be falling, but we'll 

b~ trying some of the hardest stuff 
and really pushing our limits, 
whereas in a competition format, 

it's a little more reserved and me 
idea is not to fall ." 

BMX legend Dave Mirra 
explained the difference between 
participating in a competitive event 
and a show like the Boom Boom 
Huckjam Tour. 

"Contests have their place. 1 
thinlc it's the hardest form of rid-
ing," Mirra said. "Obviously this is 
the best thing in the world, but I've 
enjoyed riding contests a lot." 

Hoffman agreed, saying mat he 
prefers the atmosphere of some-
ming like Tony Hawk's tour over a 
competition. 

"1 rode COntests for 20 years," 
Hoffman said. "In contests, it's so 
fonnatted. Here, you can just ride. 
It's like controlled chaos . .. I really 
enjoy mis stuff." 

Hoffman , like Hawk, has a 
video game with his name on it. 

"Video games have immortal-
ized the sport," Hoffman said. 
"You notice people who can expe-
rience the sport through video 
games. I never realized the best 
way to promote our sport was to 
corne our with a kick-ass video 
game." 

But unlike the ~deo game, a 
hard fall in real life can be a very 
painful. 

"I got knocked out at the last 
show," Mirra said of the San 
Antonio show three days earlier. "I 
got worked. Sometimes you push 
too hard when you're not feeling it. 
T had to get knocked silly to tone it 
down a lime hit. There's something 
about the live music that puts you 
in a different state of mind." 

Another athlete shared Mirra's 
excitement about me band. 

"It's cool to have Offspring and 
Face to Face [both of whom per-
formed earlier in the tour], but 
Della is my favorite," skateboarder 
Bucky Lasek said. "They were play-
ing while we were warming up, and 
I was feeling it." 

The tour is a chance for the 
combination of so many forms of 
entertainment, but athletes are also 
using it as an opportunity to reach 
our and have an influence in the 
citi es they travel to. MacDonald is 
the first athlete spokesman for me 
Partnership for a Drug Free 
America.

Deja vu for 
vocal soccer 

fans over 
weekend 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

I thought that my last column Issued a clear proclamation to those who want to ca lise 
problems: ' tay in your ugly, melly 
t wns and accept your loss to us 
with some dignity' 

That said , I may have underesti-
lllJ ted the illiteracy rate at Cal State 
San Bernardino. T hose punks came 
into Triton occer Stadium on Oct. 
10 and decided to cause a ruckus. 

It .Iil started when their women's 
team got beaten 3-0 in the opener. 
Check that: Our team gOt beaten 
- CSUSB just los t the game. In 
' an Bernardino, they have a, prob-
lem explaining the concept of team 
SPOrtS to young children, so in all 
thei r youth leagues, they explain it 
this way: 

"Soccer is like being in a gang. 
You wear the same color and you 
run around together hitting anyone 
who comes near you and trying to 
do as much damage as possible." 

It doesn 't take a 1,600 SAT 
score to understand that, which is a 
good thing, because most students 
at CSUSB sti ll think the test is out 
of 1,000. Who cares, anyway? I 
mean, we all know the test is 
biased; it's clearly discriminatory 
against stupid people. 

So after all that happened, the 
men 's game started. UCSD got on 
the board early and then Mr. Jason 
''I'm white but I think I'm hard, 
kind of like Eminem only without 
talent" Koza scored for the 
Coyotes to even the game. A bunch 
of my friends and I were chilling in 
our couches, which we'd set up 
down by the field, and Koza comes 
by to rub it in. Big mistake. 

First of all Jason, you just tied the 
score in a Division II soccer game, 
you didn't win the World Cup. 
Second, your team sucks' There's a 
reason that CSUSB has gone 4-7-1 
in conference this year, and my 
guess is that the problem was not 
lack of proper celel>ration. Third, 
Mr. Koza , I don't know if you real-
ize this, but when you ta lk to the 
crowd, we're going to talk right back 
and get in your head. And thats a 
dark, lonely and empty place that 
you don't want us rattling around in. 

In the second half,Jason proved 
us right on every point when he 
tripped over the ball late in the 
game and fell on his face 
while UCSD went on to score the 
winning goal, but he still doesn't 
win the moron-of-the-night award . 

That distinction goes to the 
CSUSB women's soccer team and 
their boyfriends (or were they 
brothers? In places like San 
Bernardino, you just can't tell some-
times). These lovely ladies came 
down to field level and started to 
pick a fight with me and my friends. 
They did not appreciate our picking 
on Jason and the rest of his gang -
err ... team - and told us to either 
shut up or fight. Seem familiar? 

Anyway, we continued to watch 
the game while one of their girls 
kept yelling. She called my friend a 
chicken for not wanting to fight. 
No wait, she must have used a 
smaller word. Seven letters would 
have been a new record for her.

UCSD wins fourth game in a row, 
keeps lead in CCAA South division 

By CHRlsnNE LIM 
Staff Writer 

It was cold, dark and overcast. 
Rain from the morning and pre-
vious day had made Triton Soccer 
Stadium a muddy, slippery play-
ing field. In other words, it was 
perfect weather for a soccer 
game. 

On Oct. 26, the UCSD 
women's soccer team shutout the 
Cal State San Bernardino 
Coyotes to win its last home 
game of the season 3-0. 

The Tritons not only held on 
as leaders in the South Division 
of the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, but also 
extended their winning streak to 
four games and improved their 
conference record to 12-2 . The 
team is undefeated at home this , 
season. 

CSUSB controlled the first 
few minutes of the game with 
dominant play. Luclcily, the 
Tritons were able to score early at 
the 11 :33 mark w~n junior rnid-

fielder Megan Mendoza, assisted 
by junior forward Shannon 
Harrelson, scored off a corner 
lcick mishandled by Coyote goal-
keeper Amanda Hernandez. 

Later in the game, sophomore 
midfielder Christine Kwon came 
in for Harrelson at the 32 :40 
mark. Kwon immediately made 
her presence known by scoring 
the second goal of the night. 
Assisted by Mendoza and junior 
midfieldh Kristen Conahan, 
Kwon made a clear shot past 
Hernandez at 34:57 . 

In the second half, the Tritons 
earned two corner kicks early on, 
but were unable to convert either 
of them into goals. At the 59:49 
mark, Harrelson made a break-
away, but was unable to score due 
to an offside call. 

With less than 20 minutes of 
play left, freshman Lindsey 
Treanlder attempted a goal, but it 
was too high and bounced off the 
top crossbar of the goal. Kwon

Men's soccer wins 
its final home game 

Tritons victorious in a must .. win 
situation as sen iors bid farewell 

By CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
battled hard and was victorious by 
a final of 3-2 in a must-win game 
against Cal State San Bernardino 
on Oct. 26. With the win, the 
Tritons are currently ranked sec-
ond in the South Division of the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. 

The seniors on the team said 
goodbye as they played their final 
game at UCSD. Emotions were 
clearly running high in this piv-
otal game, as evidenced by the 
intense physical play of both 
teams and the spirited support of 
the crowd. 

"We won tonight because we 
all decided to play hard, and we 

had the same desire to win," said 
Triton midfielder Matthew 
Davey, who tallied a goal in the 
first half. 

The contributions of fresh-
men Davey and Jon Krupanksy 
are an indication that the Tritons 
will continue to carry a strong, 
winning spirit that the outgoing 
seniors brought to the team. 

The game started off quickly 
with Triton senior co-captain 
Kris Chiles scoring a goal off the 
left post only 59 seconds into the 
contest. The Coyotes tied it up 
with a goal from forward Jason 
Koza, but the Tritons took the 
lead again when Davey scored off 
of a free kick. 

The physical play intensified

Tritons take fourth 
in conference meet 

By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD men's and women's 
cross country teams had a disap-
pointing finish at this past week-
end's California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships in Cal 
State Bakersfield, with both teams 
talcing fourth place. Both teams 
were ranked third in the West 
region of the CCM heading into 
the meet. 

"We were flat," said head 
coach Dan Van Arsdale. "They 
raced as fast as they could race, 
but they struggled a bit. The 
teams' psychology has been 
directed towards the regional and 
nationals, and I did not have them 

correctly prepared for the confer-
ence." 

On the women's side, .Audrey 
Sung had her best-ever showing 
at the CCAA meet, finishing sec-
ond to Cal State Los Angeles' 
Annmarie Houson with a time of 
21 :21.27 in the 6,000-meter race. 
Sung earned All-CCAA honors, 
which is awarded to the top 15 
runners in each race, for the sec-
ond consecutive year to go along 
with her academic All-American 
and track and field All-American 
status. 

Following Sung were Tritons 
Lillian Gardiner, who finished 
19th with a time of 22 :14.04;
