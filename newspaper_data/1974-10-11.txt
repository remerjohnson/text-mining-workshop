Three Homes Raided~ , 
Ten Students Charged 

by Rich Yep 

UCSD Sponsors Conference 
Today on Controlled Growth 

Within the last teo days, three private homes were raided by North 
Courty sheriffs, resulting in a total of ten UCSD students brought up 
on criminal charges. Two of the homes were located in Del Mar, the 
other in EI Cajon . 

Concerning the Del Mar busts, Student Affairs Legal Counsel 
Raphael Leven speculated, " It's clear to me that an undercover agent 
was operating in both arrests, and that students should simply take 
that into account." 

According to Leven, one student apparently admitted his guilt to 
officers with the assumption that his friends would go free . However, 
both that student and his friends were charged . 

"The best thing to do for busted students is to calmly indicate to 
the authorities that they want no statement made until they ca ll an 
attorney," commented Leven. 

ArrCfignment took place for most of the students on Wednesday. 
Four pleaded not gui lty, one pleaded guilty, and the other four have 
taken the option of the drug diversion program . 

Navy Gives Scripps 5.8 
Acres of Pt. Lorna Land 

by Fr .. nk b FO'le 
The Navy has given Scripps 

Institution of Oceanography title 
to 5.8 acres of Federal land on 
Point Loma. The land was leased 
by the Navy to Scripps by an 
agreement that was set to expire 
In 1989. The Navy then tran-
sferred the land to the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and 
Welfare, which passed it to 
Scripps.

Includes g neral sessions for 
delegates, an open symposium

The land, located at the end of 

Rosecrans Street, site of the

new pier and marginal wharf 
exte ntion and supporting

Barrett Discusses Food Services 

The new pier, completed last 
March, is one of only two in San 
Diego that have complete sewer 
connections. The other is located 
at Point Loma at the Submarine 
Support Facility. 

Described as one of the world's 
finest shore bases for supporting 
oceanographic research, Scripps' 
$2 million marine facility can 
now accommodate its fleet of 
eight research ships. 

Scripps' research vessels that 
will birth at the new dock are the 
1900 ton Melville. which has a 
range of nearly 10,000 miles and 
can stay at sea for six weeks, the 

by Hannah Cohen 

The cafeteria spends $2 .80 per day per student, 
says Larry Barrett, Director ot' Housing and Food 
Services at UCSD. This means that a student pays 
approximately $19 .60 per week for board. 

The above prices include a 1590 average miss 
meal factor which keeps food cost to students 
significantly lower. Another factor included is the 
loss due to silverware, china and food thefts by 
students. The cost of replacing silverware alone was 
$4,000 last year. If thefts were reduced, the rates 
would be S15-S20 ' less per !>tudent per year. 

Barrett feels that the dorm rates were probably 
not raised enough to comp~nsate for the inflation 
of food prices but he considers the raising of dorm 
rates a " last resort" to coping with infla ion . He 
does consider it a possibility that the rates at the 
snack bars might have to be raised in the future. 

Barrett feels that most of the complai nts about 

food quality result from the " monotony" of eating 
in the same place day after day, not from what is 
being served. He admits that, like anywhere else, 
the afeterias do have better and worse days. 

The bids will begin to come in for construction 
contracts for the Third College dorms in about a 
week . Barrett is hopeful that If construction begins 
by December that they will be completed for Fall 
75. 

At this time, administrators have approached the 
Reg~nts with a plan to build a 200 apartment 
complex which would hold four people per 
apartment. It would be similar to and constructed 
near the Mesa apartments. One hundred Â· fifty 
apartments would be designated for un-
dergraduates and fifty for graduate students. 

According to Barrett, there is a definite trend 
towards building more apartment complexes on

Wann, Family Drama 

(This is the story of a family . A family has as many stories as can b~ 
stomached. This is one story of one family, the Pear-Waltons. Papa 
Pear-Walton had three children by a previous marriage. They were 
Peter Pear-Walton, Pablo Pear-Walton, and David Cassidy. Papa's 
first in murder and scandal. Mama was spared the trauma of a 
previous marriage though not the kids . Her three contributions were 
Julie Ann Morrow, Texas Guinan, and Rhode Island Rhoda. 

The Pear-Waltons lived on the top of an old Indian burial ground in 
Central Iowa. Papa had gotten the land from his pa who said it was an 
old Viking Land Grant he bought dirt cheap, along with several 
bottles of snake oil . They were lucky to have the land paid for as they 
lived there during the Great Depression of the '30's ... ) 

The Pear-Walton family was seated around their big oak table, a 
Thanksgiving meal spread before them. After what seemed like eons, 
Papa Pear-Walton finished praying. 

"Papa," Peter spoke, "why can't we have turkey like everybody 
else?" 

Papa_eyed Peter coldly. " Because we' re miserably poor." 
Peter sighed deeply. "Yeah , but did you have to kill Spot?" 
"Oh, second-guessing me, et, Peter?" Papa said caustically . He rose 

from his chair and grabbed Peter by the throat . 
"I'll learn you some manners," he chuckled, slamming Peter 

against the wall. As Peter lay there in a pool of surprise, Papa sat 
down with all eyes upon him. 

"Save a paw for Peter when he wakes up," Papa said. "Spot 
~ould've wanted it that way." 

The children were arranged around the room practicing being 
humble and reasonable when a knock came on the door. 

"Daddy, it's the City Council ," David said from the door. 
Papa Pear-Walton went to the door. He came up to Mama POW a 

few moments later to tell her he'd be gone awhile " to talk." 
As soon as he'd gone, the kids pulled out Papa's Sears catalog and 

drooled at all the fine products therein . Papa didn't allow them to do 
it when he was there because he said the wet pages were dangerous 
to use because they fell apart in your hands. 

The kids spent a couple of hours poring over the document, each 
thinking of how surprised Papa was going to be the next time ... â¢ 

Then Papa came back. He walked into the living room and pulled 
Julie to him. 

"Where's Mama?" he whispered. 
" Upstairs, sewing," Julie Ann replied . " Why?" 
"Get the kids together quietly and I' ll tell you all outside." 
The long shadows of the live oak tree stumps merged with the 

darkness so well it was impossible to see the shadows at all. In fact, 
there were no shadows. It was pitch dark . 

Papa Pear followed a shadow to a stump which he sat upon. He 
drew a sweaty hand across the lower part of his face, sighing. 

"You know," he began, " we've never had a lot of money. 
Sometimes we've even gone without food ." He paused. " I don't like 
th ings this way, I never have. I'd like you to have the things you 
want.. .well, the reason I've a~'<ed you out here is to help me decide 
on something. Kids, I've been offered a real good deal and would'V\:! 
accepted it - if it hadn't been for you . It wouldn't be fair not to ask ' 
you what you think of it." 

"Kids, I got a great offer on your mother. Now wait! " Pfl:-W spoke; 
raising his hands and stopping th., children's chatter. " Before you say 
yes, think about it. Who' ll COOK your meals, clean your c lothe~ , and 
send for the catalogs? I want you to think it over out here and when 
you've made your decision, come inside and tell me." Papa Pear-
Walton rose and walked to the house, hands in h is pockets. 

About half an hour later, the kids came in. Pablo spoke for them. 
"Papa, we want to see the catalog." 

Though puzzled, Papa gave him the book. "What are you 
looking for?" 

Pablo grinned. "The order blank."

The University of California, 
according to Flournoy, will 
maintain that premier po~ition in 
higher education with the top 
12'1i % of California students. 

On other issues, Flournoy said 
that if elected he would have a 
broad based administration 
encouraging more minority 
groups and women to participate. 
Flournoy stated that although 
people have wtisized the Reagan 
administration for its lack of 
m inority participation , the 
Reagan years doubled the 
number of minority appointees 
over any other previous ad-
ministrtation. Flournoy went on

should not be paid out of general 
revenues to conduct large meuia 
campaigns. "Govern~nt should 
try to cut the cost of cal'1paigns 
and make it easier for people to 
run," according to Fang. She said 
she presently has a bill before the 
assembly which would provide 
for a statewide voter handbook 
in which canuidates could put a 
statement of their qualifications 
and programs before the elec-
torate. 

Fong said the handbook would 
be similar to those put out by 
local governments for school 
board candidates and other non-
partisan races. 

When asked whether she favors 
a September primary over the 
present June primary, Fong said , 
" I only oppose the September 
primary because It would 
discriminate against students who 
haven't gone back to school yet."

the people of California can 
expect something similar 
Flournoy also supports the 
establishment of a minority small 
business administration' which 
would . assist minority 
businessmen and increase em-
ployment opportunities for the 
minority community. 

Flournoy's priorities also in-
clude a program of supporting 
housing for the low and middle 
income family by lowering in-
terest rates . Flournoy believes 
that much of the incentive 
necessary to solve the housing 
problems must come from the 
local level rather than the federal 
government . He cited a plan in 
Pa lo Alto In which new 
dev :! lopments were encouraged 
for low income families. Flournoy 
believes that the problem of tight 
money for construction of low 
cost hOUSing is a direct result of 
property taxes supporting school 
systems . He said this adds to the 
cost of housing which primarily 
hurts the low income people.

Despite an improving defense 
and the outstanding play of AII -
Tournament goalie John Prim, 
UCSD's soccer team was dropped 
three times last weekend in the 
Second San Diego State In-
vitational Tournament. 

Tritons' record was lowered 
to 1-3 with the trio of shutout 
losses, 3'{) to Westmont Ccllege, 

2~ to San Diego State, and 1~ to 
UC Berkely. 

'With the exception of Cal 
State fullerton (which will be 
hosted by UCSD November 9), 
Westmont and SDSU were 
probably tougher than anyone 

we'll be playing all year," said 
Coach Stewart Hayes, "I felt that 
this tourney would give us a good 
chance to get in shape. It did help 
to solidify the squad and I think it 
helped us prepare for the AII-Cal 
Tournament (scheduled for 
October 25 and 26)", Hayes 
continued. 

Westmont's Warriors took 
advantage of three early goals, 
then held on for a well-played 
shutout win in the game played 
Friday morning. 

Coming back to play Friday 
night, the Tritons came very close 
to victory against the eventual 
tourney winner, San Diego State. 
The battle was scoreless for the 

Spik~rs Drop Opener

In the first g<lme of the 1974 season, the Triton women's volleyball 
team was defeated 2-1 by Palomar Tuesday afternoon at UCSD. 

The Triton women showed two opposite sides to their play in the 
three game match, losing 15-13 and 15-9 in the first and third games, 
but winning decisively, 15-4, in the middle game. 

"There was no doubt In my mind that we were the best team on the 
floor," said Coach Chuck Millenbah, "but when you make that many 
mistakes, there's no way you can win ." 

Millenbah referred to the turning point in the match as the seven 
throw, or illegal hit calls made by the referee on UCSD in the final 
game. 

In a very close opening game, the score was tied five times, as late 
as 11-11 , and neither team had a lead of more than three points at any 
time. At one point UCSD leaa 11-8, but then gave up six straight 
points before losing. 

Spikes by Margl Schwartz and Eva Ljungwe sparked an easy second 
game win . In that rout, the Tritons scored the first seven and last six 
points in coasting to the 15-4 victory. 

In the finale, Palomar won another close game that was tied as late 
as 8-8 . Millenbah cited the olay of Andrea Beylp.n, .Sue Papanek, and 
Ellen O'Rorke as "Ql ltstanding." 

The Triton women will get another chance to do a lot of things well 
as they perform in the tough AII-Cal Tournament this weekend at 
UCLA.

good oportunities to score. 

" Because of the high quality of 
SDSU's personnel, we had to play 
a defensive game and rely mainly 
on counter attacks for our of-
fense," said Hayes. Two late 
Aztec goals ruined the strategy 
and gave them a close win.

Acummulative Art 
On Display In 

La Jolla 
An exhibitioll by Arman, one of the most 

significent artists working in the medium of 
assemblage, will be showi~g through October 
29 at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art. Arman's work involves the accumulation 
or destruction of numerous types of objects, 
such as a burnt cello embedded in plastic, an 
assemblage of toothbruslles in concrete, and 
the above pictured accumulation of 
typewriters entitled '.Moneys x.iypewritersX. 
Time = Hamlet". Although his approach to art 
is one of selection and therefore, related to 
Duchamp, his works also show an interest in 
the esthetics of composition, color and texture .. 

The exhibition includes approximately 70 
works and was organized by the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art and will be 
circulated to four additional museums. 

CONCERIS Electric Fla8 IMoby Grape 
Around the time that the 

Seatles were putting the finishing 
touches on "Sergeant Pepper's", a 
group of Bay Area musicians were 
recording another landmark 
album. They called themselves 
the Electric Flag: an American 
Music Band; their sound was an 
amalgam of the best in yollng, 
riotous and mostly urban rhythm 
and blues. Among the originai 
members were Michael 
Bloomfield, Buddy Miles, Harvey 

Brooks, Herbie Rich , Nick 
Gravenites, Marcus ~ubleday, 
and Â· Richie Havens. all 
established names in the 
recording industry. 

Collectively, they represented a 
staggering amount of musical 
experience from a variety of 
locales and formal backgrounds. 
Their roots were in rock, jazz, 
blues and classical. The fusion 
was powerful, visually as well as 
musically. Buddy Miles used to 

Concert Notes 
by Larry Deckel 

Blue Oyster Cult will appear in concert with T. Rex on Sunday 
Oct. 13 at the San Diego Golden Hall at 7:30. Blue Oyster Cult 
(pictured above) is a 5-man Scandinavian group, whose musical 
concepts seem to dwell heavily Into violence and murder . This is 
supposed ly the result of a gig they played at Oaxaca, when two (not 
one, count 'em) eclipses occured within min~tes of each other. The 
connection may seem vague, but none the less Blue Oyster Cu lt is 
now one of the foremost "heavy metal" bands. Electric guitars 
teamed with synthesizers explode in a frenzy of rhythm . 

T. Rex is Mark Bolan and Mi ckey Finn (who joined Marc in '69 
replaCing original partner Steve Peregrine Took) and r)1ore e lectric, 
dynamic, and hard-rock (despite the fact that T. Rex's biggest fame 
comes from hit-si ngle "Bang a Gong") Legend has it that Marc first 
discovered Mickey in a macrobiotic restaurant at the time he was 
looking for the other half of Tyrannosaurus Rex. 

Rumor (as yet unconfirmed) rlas it that joining Cult and Rex on 
the bill will be UFO Â· 

Tonight, however, if you're looking for some sounds, The Greek 
Bowl at S.D. State is presenting "An Evening of Good 01' Outdoor 
Boogie!" featuring the return to San Diego of The Elvin Bishop 
Band. On the same bill will be the "Texas Cannonball" Freddie King, 
and added attraction Bootleg. More still: since it's the last big 
outdoor concert of the year at the Greek Bowl , they're throwing in a 
spectacular lighting & visuals show to be created by St. Elmo's Fire, 
and to top off the entire "boogie" an explosive Fireworks show will 
be produced by California Fireworks Display. Dynamite! 

A few other dates worth thinking about this week : October 13 
marks birthdays for Marie Osmond and Paul Simon. October 15 sing 
happy birthday In careful harmonies for Richard Carpenter. And put 
out the flag October 17 (Thursday) as it marks A) the Beatles' first 
TV appearance in 1962; B) the arrival of the Rolling Stones in LA for 
their US tour 1969; and C) the anniversary of Chopin's death, 1849.

wear what may have been the 
original American Flag shirt; he 
and Herbie Rich, both Blacks, 
played beside Italians, WASPS, 
and Chicanos. All together with 
horns, keyboards, guitars and 
multiple percussionists, could 
they ever blow. The music was 
political , it was fun, it had soul, it 
had meaning. 

Right: all the heavy cats have 
always been into this . But in 1967, 
Great Britain ruled the world of 
pop (flip through your old 
records .) It's embarrassing. You 
never listen to that stuff anymore; 
on the other hand, most recent 
Stone's mate rial incorporates 
Flag-style arrangements . When 
the Flag unfurled, musicians and 
listeners alike knew that here was 
a distinctly American music we 
cou ld be proud of. 

We're still proud . And the 
Electric Flag still blows like no 
other band around. They proved 
it last Sunday night in concert at 
the UCSD Gym. Most of the 
original mf'mbers are back, and 

the sound is about the same, 
brassy and full. Nick Gravenites, 
who's written so much good 
music, worked with and sheltered 
so many good musicians, is still 
here, rumpled and seedy, 
crooning like a matinee idol , 
Bloomfield scuttles around the 
stage, fitting licks in spaces, 
tenderly, almost reluctant to let 
the notes go. He loves the blues, 
though, and won't stop once he's 
started till he just burns out. 
There's a new baSSist, Roger "Jelly 
Roll" Turner, with a great set of 

. lungs-he'S the perfect vocal 
complement to Buddy Miles, 
squat and shiny, grinning behind 
his cymbals and singing so 
sweetly. There's Barry Goldberg 
on keyboards, inscrutable behind 
his beard, playing ripples and 
razors . They're hot, 

Just like they always were. It's 
not unusual, innovative, music. It 
is gut-real. The Flag's style of 
music has been around a long 
time, will be, because it reflects 
an essential condition . They were

Setting Up (;areer Options 

The number and variety of occupations have proliferated in recent years, affording an ntrant 
numerous possibilities for combining interests and ski ll s. Yet because of market and manpower factors 
many occupational areas are difficult to e nter. Career thinking which IS either vague or narrowly goa l-
oriented appears less successful in the long-run than thinking which sets up a se lect ion pI options to be 
pursued or discarded later as events pan out. This involves understanding the occupational consequences 
of your education early- well before leavi ng college-and being able to make better decisions about 
classes, as well as becoming familiar with how to get a job, or how to continue your education, o r how to 
begin an alternative career. 

Career Planning has set up open hours thiS quarter- an informal drop-In/cirop-out time for students to ask 
career-relateq questions and discuss methods of career exploration. Two workshops-one on car er option 
and the other on job-seeking techniques-are being offered twice during the Fall. Students may also use 
self-i nstructional resources-research papers and the Career I nformation Library-from 8-noon and 1-5 p m. 
each weekday. Inquire at Career Planning, 6008 Muir H&SS for more information about these activities.

The Professional and Administrative Career Examination 
(PACE) replaces the old Federal Service Entrance Examination 
this year PACE consists of a batte'~ of written tests deSigned to 
measure abilities required for a wide va riety of jobs in federal 
agencies across the country. About 85 percent of these posit ions 
are filled outside the Washington D.C. area. Most pos~tions do 
not require specialized education or experience. 

Persons with a college degree or equivalent experience. or who 
are a candidate for'a delHee can take PACE. The first PACE 
written te t will be given in November, 1974; there will be none 
In December, and testing will continue again on a bi-monthly 
basis from January through May, 1975. To be scheduled for the 
November. 1974 test, your application must be received no later 
than October 31, 1974. Other deta ils concerning the kinds of jobs 
fdled through PACE, how to apply, forms, etc ., are available at 
Career Planning & Placement, 6008 MUIr H&SS 

(Today's turbulent economy affects not only job-holders, but 
job-seekers or anyone else trying to set-out on her/hls own. 
Synthesizing Information from our sources, Careet Planning will 
examine the employment/ market situation in future articles)
