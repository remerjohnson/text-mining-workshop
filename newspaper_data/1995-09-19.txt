Fraternity Artifacts 
Unearthed 
BERKELEY - Construction 
workers at UC Berkeley made a 
startling discovery just over a 
week ago, when they uncov-
ered antique bottles which 
archaelogists believe to be 
remnants of Zeta Psi, the oldest 
Berkeley fraternity house. 
Archeology students converged 
on the site for the next two 
days, scouring it for additional 
artifacts. Whiskey bottles, 
porcelain cups bearing the 
fraternal crest and a bone 
toothbrush were unearthed -
items which may date back to 
the 1880s.

STATE COLLEGE, PA-In 
the wake of its largest freshman 
class ever, Pennsylvania State 
University housing officials are 
scrambling to accommodate 
more than 700 students needing 
places to stay. The university 
has been forced to house nearly 
760 of the 4,263 freshmen in 
crowded study lounges and 
private homes. Officials said 
the rise in enrollment was due, 
in part, to increased appl ica-
tions following Penn State' s

Ex-Police Dispatcher 
Reports Harassment 
COMPLAINT: Female UCSD 
dispatcher files EEOC claim 
ByTedd Ladd 
Senior Staff Writer 

Citing "a hostile work environment" and in-
stances when she was "intimidated and sexually 
harassed," a former UCSD police dispatcher filed 
a complaint last month with the U.S. Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). 

The dispatcher, who wished to remain anony-
mous, said UCSD Police Dispatcher Supervisor 
Luis Santaella began harassing her in December 
1994, shortly after she gained probationary em-
ployment at the on-campus station. 

During the 12-month probationary period, a 
university employee can be let go without the 
benefit of an appeal. 

The UCSD police department discharged the 
dispatcher from her position on June 30, 1995. 

The complainant said her release was due to 
"retaliation" on the part of Santaella, and that she 
was being "pushed out" because of her complaints 
about his actions. 

"From day one, I was subjected to sexual ha-
rassment," she said. "[Santaella] would stand close 
to women in an intimidating [and] condescending 
way ... 1 was constantly being looked at with 'eleva-
tor eyes.'" 

The UCSD police department denied the ha-

Atkinson 
Chosen as 
NewUC 
President 
FRESH START: Job 
begins on Oct. 1, when 
PeItason leaves UC 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson 
will become the 17th president of the 
University of California on October 1, 
taking over for retiring President Jack 
Peltason. 

The UC regents selected the 66-year-
old Atkinson after their first choice, Ohio 
State University President E. Gordon Gee, 
withdrew from consideration. This oc-
curred after reports surfaced that be had 
secretly approved bonuses for his aides 
during his 1980s tenure as president of the 
University of Colorado. 

"The University of California has ful-
filled the hopes and aspirations of Cali-
fornians for the past 127 years," Atkinson 
said, after learning of his selection. 

"I am honored to be a part ofthis great 
tradition and will take whatever steps are 
necessary to ensure that the university 
fulfills its leadership role," he added. 

Atkinson's departure comes on the 
heels of a study by the non-profit National 
Research Council ranking UCSD 10th 
among 274 institutions surveyed. 

In an open letter to the university com-
munity, Atkinson wrote of tbe "warmth 
and gratitude" he felt toward UCSD's 
faculty, students and staff. He singled out 
the faculty, considering his association 
with them "the greatest honor of being 
chancellor. " 

Atkinson also lauded UCSD's 16,698 
registered students for their "quest for the 
life of the mind," as well their "commit-
ment to the good of our society [that] 
reminds us of the university 's larger pur-
pose."

UCSD Takes Top-tO Spot in National Graduate Rankings 
BEST: Oceanography 
and neuroscience rank 
first in nation 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

UC San Diego's graduate pro-
grams tied for 10th in the nation, 
according to a report released last 
Tuesday by the Washington-based 
National Research Council. 

The council's 738-page report, 
entitled "Research-Doctorate Pro-
grams in the United States: Conti-
nuity and Change," wu based on a 

four-year study that began in 1991. 
The study ranked the faculty 

quality .and effectiveness of 3,634 
doctoral programs in the arts and 
humanities, biological sciences, en-
gineering, physical sciences and 
mathematics, and social and behav-
ioral sciences. 

UCSD ranked 10th among the 
274 institutions surveyed, tying with 
Columbia University, the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-Madison and the 
University of Michigan. Fourteen 
UCSD programs ranked in the top 
10 in their respective fields, with 
oceanography and neuroscience 

ranking first nationwide. 
"We're extraordinarily pleased 

to be number one," said Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography Direc-
tor Edward Frieman. "I would have 
hung myself if we weren't, so I'm 
doubly pleased we made it." 

"[Our success] is really due to an 
extraordinary group of people," 
Frieman added. "I can't say enough 
about them - their qualities, the 
kinds of research they do [and] their 
dedication to oceanography and this 
institution. "

Contractor's Mistake 
Floods Main Library ETCETERA ... 
SOAKED: Broken pipe during construction sends 
water rushing into the library and Price Center 

THE BEST OF CALVIN IE HOBBES by Bill Watterson 

By Anna Vllaman 
Senior St8ff Writer 

July 3 was just another quiet sum-
mer morning until the Central Uni-
versity Library 's (CUL) front-door 
motion sensors caused them to open 
just after 9 a.m., letting approxi-
mately 1.5 million gallons of water 
rush into the main floor and down 
the stairwells. 

Several library employees recalled 
seeing a Library Walk contractor run-
ning and shouting down one of the 
corridors, but he was 
thigh-deep in water 
before he could do 
anything more. 

According to 
Bob Wielage, direc-
tor of architecture 
and project manager 
for UCSD Facilities 
Design and Con-
struction (FD&C), a 
construction worker 

• with fans and dehumidifiers, re-
placed drywall paneling and repaired 
elevator and security equipment. 

Because of the high volume of 
water, the crews had to check for pos-
sible mold, fungi and mildew growth 
- all of which form quickly and can 
potentially affect library collections. 
They lowered the temperature in the 
library down to the mid-50s (Fahren-
heit) to slow fungus growth. 

UCSD Environment Health and 
Safety (EH&S) members used an 

. instrument called a 
biotest to measure 
the number of fun-
gus colonies per 
cubic meters of air.

According to

ager of the occupa-

hygiene division of 
EH&S, some fungi 
began to develop in 
the carpeting dur-
ing the first three 
days of the flood. 
EH&S also found 
fungus growth in 
some of the walls, 
behind the drywall. 
However, the 
amount of fungus 
dropped dramati-
cally after removal 
and replacement of 
the wet carpet and 
drywall . 

Professor to Advise U.S. Park Service 

According to 
Deputy University 
Librarian Phyllis 
Mirsky, the Music 
Ubrary (on the first 
floor of the Central 
ubrary) sustained the 
mostseriousdamage. 

"We covered the 
collections [with plastic dropcloths] 
and bailed things out quickly ... Oth-
erwise, it would have been a disas-
ter," she said. 

"No music books or scores were 
affected, but a number of CD inserts ... 
got wet," said Garrett Bowles, head of 
the Music Ubrary. "Amazingly, nei-
ther any computer equipment nor our 
listening console was damaged. " 

Science & Engineering Library 
materials were damaged, however. 
Approximately 200 books on the 
fi rst floor of the library were soaked, 
although the library staff has since 
recovered and restored aU of them. 

FD&C crews removed nearly 
7,000 square feet of carpeting, re-
placed many water-stained ceiling 
tiles on the first floor, dried walls 

No employees 
had allergy prob-
lems with the fun-
gus, but two people 
were "hypersensi-
tive" to the wet-
paint fumes after 
completion of re-
pairs and therefore 
worked in another 
section of the li-
brary during the 

week of the flood, said Kowalewsky. 
"It's been surprisingly com-

plaint-free, but I think that's be-
cause we took such an aggressive 
approach," Kowalewsky added. 

Wielage agreed with 
Kowalewsky 's accountoffew com-
plaints and the drop in fungus 
growth. 

"The moisture content and fungi, 
spores ... are way, way down," 
Wielage said. "We don't have a sick 
building. We've got a clean bill of 
health."

Aflirmative~Action Supporters Criticize Regents'. Decision 
opposmON: Systemwide 
drop in minority enrollments 
,expected as result of vote 
By Ivan De!venthal 
Associate News Editor 

In a controversial vote cast July 20 in San 
Francisco; tfte UC regents narrowly approved 
a resolution to discontinue affirmative-action 
policies in university admissions, hiring and 
contracting. 

As a result of the regents' historic vote, the 
UC system becomes the nation's largest pub-
lic organization to reject affirmative action. 

The board's decision to eliminate affirma-
tive-action programs has prompted vjlried re-
sponses from students, faculty and staff con-
nected with the UC system. 

" It is a huge step backward for the univer-
sity," said A.S. President Naomi Falk, who 
attended the regents ' meeting, held this sum-
mer at UCSF. 

"We will see theeffects'ofthis into the next 
few decades, as it will negatively impact the 
student population and quality of education at 
the University of California," Falk added. 

University of California Student Associa-
tion (UCSA) Field Organizer Kimi Lee saw 
the regents' vote in much the same light. 

"The elimination of affirmative action ... 
and the Congress' proposals to eliminate mil-
lions of dollars in student aid is turning back 
the clock on highet education," Lee said. 

Edward L6pez, director of the student af-
firmative-action and human-relations pro-
grams at UCSD, said the regents' decision 
will make it harder to achieve diversity 
throughout the UC system, but it has the 
potential to bring about "something positive." 

"The regents' action is giving everyone the 
opponunity to explore and have dialogue about 
affirmative-action issues, and what it means 
to be underrepresented in higher education," 
LOpez said. 

"We also have the chance to find the causes 
of these problems and figure out what we can 
do about solving them without hurting other 
groups," he added. 

In a letter sent systemwide, outgoing UC 
President Jack Peltason wrote, "One of our 
most important tools to promote diversity and 
excellence will be the expansion of our out-
reach efforts to inform students about and 
prepare them for a university education." 

Also in the letter, Peltason wrote that al-
though the regents' vote to end affirmative 
action "was contrary to the recommendation 
of the president, the chancellors, the academic 
council and the alumni and student associa-

tions ... our responsibility is to implement the 
two resolutions approved by the board in 
ways that are faithful to their intent and to 
their explicitly stated goal of reflecting 
California's diverse population among our 
faculty, staff and students." 

Many affirmative-action supporters believe 
the regents' new policy will adversely affect 
the university. 

"It is projected that if you eliminate race 
and ethnicity in admissions, there will be a 50-
percent drop in the African-American popu-
lationanda 15-25-percentdropin the Chicano 
population, across the UCsystem," said LOpez. 

"We have a history in this country of 
certain groups being discriminated against," 
said Joseph Watson, UCSD vice-chancellor 
of student affairs. "I don'tseehow theuniver-
sity addresses racial discriminatio~ by turn-
ing a blind eye toward it." 

The rnuch-debated resolutions were spear-
headed by regent Ward Connerly, an African-
American businessman from Sacramento. 
Connerly argued that the university should 
remain committed to diversity without rely-
ing on race and gender preferences. 

At the July regents' meeting, Connerly 
said, "It is ... clear to me as I suffer the charac-
terizations of 'traitor,' 'sellout,' 'Uncle Tom' 

See ACTION, Page 15 

The UC regents dropped affirmative action 
policies from student admission by 8 14 to 10 
vote. Below Is how each ragent voted.

The sudden departure of two 
Associated Students (A.S.) Council 
members over the summer is forc-
ing the council to fill the vacated 

posts before next week. 
With the resignations of AS. Vice 

President of External Affairs Erik 
Nielsen and Thurgood Marshall Col-
lege JuniorSenator Fernando Pachca>, 
the AS. and the Marshall College 
Council must now form two appoint-
ment committees for the positions. 

In an Aug. 20 letter addressed to 
the council, Nielsen announced his 
resignation - without explanation-

from the post he badoocupiod since be 
ran ,ulOflllOled in the May 1995 AS. 
elections. • 

Nielsen named Brian Dowd, the 
current campus office director, to be 
his successor as VP external. 

"Brian witnessed firsthand the 
events of last year, and gained in-
valuable insight into the inner work-
ings of this council. He has a strong

and is fully aware of the responsi-
bilities of this new position," Nielsen 
wrote in the letter. 

A.S. President Naomi Falk said 
Nielsen's resignation was unavoid-
mle due to his financial situation. 

"He was under financial con-
straints and realized he would have 
to work more hours at a higher pay-
ing job," she said. "A.S. members

Dowd said, however, that Nielsen 

rcaigned because of a multitude of 
problems. 

"He had a scholarship which ran 
out, and he will be taking 23 units in 
the fall. He also teaches swimming 
at a club downtown. It wasn't just 
one thing that forced him to resign," 
Dowd said. . 

Nielsen, who is working on a 
research project in France, was un-
available for comment. 

Calling Nielsen "an amazing or-
ganizer," Falk said she was disap-
pointed that he would not be a part of 
this year's staff. 

"He was the most dynamic VP 
[external] I have worked with," she 
said. "He.came in mid-year and re-
ally jumped in head-first." . 

As campus office director, 
Nielsen organized numerous pro-
tests against further fee hikes. 

Nielsen organized both last 
February's "take the shirts off our 
backs" campaign, in which students 
protested a proposed $360 fee in-
crease at the regents ' meeting, and a 
similar demonstration at RcgcntJohn 
Davies' office during the same month. 

Falk said that she considers the 
VP external one of the most impor-
tant positions in the A.S. and will be 
especially cautious about the ap-
pointment procedure. 

"At a time when the UCS are in 
the limelight for budget cuts [and] 
rising fees, and considering the cur-
rent Republican stand on education 
funding, the VP external office is 
crucial," she said . 

Eaclf college council will vote 
for a senator to sit on the new ap-
pointment committee, and Falk will 
ask all current external staff mem-
bers to participate in the selection. 

Although she believes Nielsen 's 
recommendation ofDowd is a strong 
one, Falk wi II open applications to 
the entire campus. 

"Brian has a lot of experience, 
which is what were looking for, and 
I believe he would be a very talented 
organizer," she said. "But to make 
this appointment process fair, we 
need to open it up to the campus as 
a whole." 

Dowd, who became involved with 
the A.S. last year when he brought 
over 100 signed T-shirts to the Febru-
ary rally, said that if appointed, he 
would concentrate on affirmative-ac-
tion and fi nancial aid problems . 

"I 'd really like to get some dia-
logue going with the regents about the 
affirmative-action issue," he said. 

The other resigning A.S. mem-
ber, Pacheco, will be transferring to 
UC Davis. 

According to Jennifer Nicoll, 
A.S. VPadministration, the Marshall 
College Council will form a com-
mittee to appoint a new senator from 
a pool of applicants.

Print Shop Shut Down ClAIM: Conflicting reports 
CLOSURE: Debt, 
mismanagement 
blamed for 58 layoffs 
By CI .. ZllNnenMn 
StsffWrlter 

Due to internal budgetary prob-
lems, fbi UCSD administration 
closed down the campus printing 
plant on Aug. 31. The action left 
32 permanent and 26 temporary 
employees out of work. 

The decision was not without 
controversy, however, as former 
employees brought forth allega-
tions of mismanagement by the 
administration. 

Now 70-percent of the 
universi~y's materials will be 
printed off campus, creating $2.3 
million in business for outside con-
tractors. 

Jack Hug, UCSD assistant vice 
chancellor of auxiliary and plant 
services, made the decision to close 
down the printing operation due to 
a $600,000 debt incurred between 
1994 and 1995. 

Although Hug refused to speak 
with the Guardiall about the do-

ad 
mania 

sure of the print shop, in a July 17 
University Communications press 
release he said, "Through tbe sale 
of equipment and other strategies 
we will eventually settle this debt, 
but the real loss is the impact on 
our employees, many of whom 
have over a decade of service to 
UCSD." 

According to tbe press release, 
the plant was shut ,Clown only after 
"broad-based efforts to make the 
operation fiscally sound," includ-
ingan attempt to implement stricter 
expectations for account manage-
ment. 

But critics believe that UCSD 
administrators did not make rea-
sonable efforts to save the print 
shop. 

"The university deliberately 
sabotaged the plant and made no 
real changes over the last year," 
said Jelger Kalmijn, president of 
the University Professional and 
Technical Employees (UPTE) 
union. 

"We find it extremely difficult 
to believe that the university 
couldn't have turned business

rassment claims, saying the 
dispatcher's firing was prompted 
by poor performance. 

"It was an ongoing difficulty 
[with her)," said UCSD Assistant 
Chief of Police Jay Dyer. "Certain 
people have it in for other people in 
the department. The allegations were 
unfounded. " 

Santaella said she was released 
because "on some days she did 
maybe so-so [at the job), and other 
days she did absolutely poorly .. 'she 
could not perform." 

"Her [harassment) complaints 
are categorically untrue. They were 
done out of vindictiveness," he 
added. 

The UCSD police department 
refused to release the performance 
records of the fired dispatcher. 

In another part of the EEOC com-
plaint, the dispatcher said that on 
June 23, 1995, she "was subjected 
to different terms and conditions of 
employment not required of other 
[employees). " 

The dispatdler said she was given 
a test in which UCSD officers and 

I always go to We Care Hair 
before my karate class, so 
I'll look good, ya know? You 
lookin' at me? Are you 
lookin' at me? 

supervisors placed a series of false 
emergency calls to observe her ef-
fectiveness. 

"I wu put through a scenario 
that had never been done before," 
she said. "It was dangerous ... What 
would have happened if a real call 
couldn't get through?" 

Santaella said the test was not un-
usual, and that it was done during the 
"slower summer period." He added 
that offICers are "advised that a test is 
taking place on that frequency" and 
"monitor" the proceedings. 

"What we do with our [dis-
patcher] training is .. . we tailor it to 
the individual," he said. "We evalu-
ate tbeir particular weaknesses.~ 

In the EEOC report, however, 
tbe dispatcher maintained that "00 
reason was given for the test." 

Each side tells conflicting sto-
ries about another section of the 
EEOC report, in which the former 
dispatcher said she "complained" to 
bersupervisors and was given "non-
action." 

"She saw me and met with 
[UCSD Police] Chief Maudie 
Bobbitt," Assistant Chief Dyer said. 
"We reviewed the doc:umentation 
and determined that there was 00 
problem. The claims were unsub-
stantiated. " 

But the dispatcher said that 
UCSD police superiors "reinforced 
[SanlaeUa's] behavior." After tak-
ing the matter through the chain of 
command - from Communica-
tions/Records Supervisor Mary 
Cabanding to Dyer to Bobbitt- the 
dispatcher said she "uked for stuff 
in writing, but it was oot given." 

Campus police uphold that no 
documentation of the complaint was 
made because the issue was strictly 
a performance matter. 

"She never complained to any-
one until the end," Santaella said. 

"There was 00 mention from 
anyone about [the harassment) until 
she believed she was going to be

PRESIDENCY: 
Controversy over 
selection 
ContInued from .... 1 

But despite a nearly unanimous 
aproval, Atkinson's selection has 
not been entirely without contro-
versy . 

Critics point to a 1981 incident 
in which Lee Perry, a former Harvard 
University professor, accused 
Atkinson of impregnating her four 
years earlier, and then tricking her 
into having an abortion. 

Atkinson settled with Perry five 
years later for $275,000, admitting 
nothing, but saying he wanted to put 
the matter behind him. 

More recently, Atkinson has 
come under fire from California 
State Senator Raymond Haynes, a 
Republican whose district includes 
UC Riverside. 

Haynes cri ticized Atkinson's 
"apparent lack of concern" over a 
controversial anicle in the alterna-
tive newspaper Voz Fronteriza, 
which advocated the murder of all 
Border Patrol agents. 

However, Atkinson does have 
his supponers. 

On the official roll call, 19 re-
gents were in favor of his appoint-
ment. Only Student Regent Edward 
Gomez voted against him. 

Atkinson became the fifth chan-
cellor of UCSD on July ), ) 980. 
During his tenure, student enroll -
ment rose 62 percent and the faculty 
grew to include six Nobel laureates, 
55 members of the National Acad-
emy of Sciences and 72 members of 
the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences. 

In addition, the university has 
consistently ranked fifth or sixth in 
total federal research funding. 

Atkinson earned a Bachelor of 
Philosophy degree from the Univer-
sity of Chicago in 1948 and a Ph.D. 
in philosophy from Indiana Univer-
sity in ) 955. He has since become a 
recognized expert in the fields of 
psychology and cognitive science. 

He is also credited with more 
than 160 scientific articles and has 
authored or co-authored nine books. 

Centering on the problems of 
memory and cognition, his research 
boosted him into the National Acad-
emy of Sciences, the American 
Philosophical Society and the Na-
tional Academy of Education. 

Atkinson has garnered honorary 
Doctor of Science degrees from 10 
American universities and is one of 
the few people to have a natural 
landmark named after them -
Antartica's Mount Atkinson was 
named in hia honor in 1980. 

As UCSD chancellor, Atkinson 
receives $189,400 per year. As preai. 
dent, he will receivo $U3,500 -

WELCOME TO UCSD 
Now Go HOME 
COMM~NTARY: Simple advice for those frightened freshmen who 
are lost 10 the academic jungle which we affectionately call UCSD 
ByTedd Udd 
Senior Staff Writer 

Abortion-rights advocates are cold-blooded killers. 
Pete Wilson should not run for president. Affirmative 
action is a band-aid solution to a bigger problem. The 
UC regents are money-grubbing leaches. 

The above is just a sampling of the diversity of 

A typical week at Anchorview works in the follow-
ing manner: The meal - if it can be called that - for 
Monday is a chicken filet. On Tuesday, the same meal 
becomes chicken strips with a "special sauce." On 
Wednesday, the meal turns into chicken stew. Thursday's 
meal is th~n called "chicken stew with a biscuit on top." 

On Fnday, the stew solidifies and is thus named 
thought one can find in the Guardian 
opinion section. Coming to you every 
Monday and Thursday in the form of 
editorials and commentaries, Guardian 
opinions represent the finest in free 
speech. 

And while I could use the very first 
Guardian opinion column to utilize this 
right to the fullest -to trash the recent 
regents ' decision to eliminate affirma-
tive action, or to attack the United 
States' foreign policy in Bosnia, or even 
to sing the praises of Fruit Roll-Ups, J 
won 'l. 

That's because I feel it's important 
to instead "tell it how it is" for those 
newcomers at UCSD: the freshmen. 

You see, once upon a time, I was a 
young, first-year pup myself. I smelled 
the salt of the fresh ocean air. I listened 
to the talking trees. I felt the agony of a 
night in TJ. I bought into the dream of 
good times and an even better school 
during my formative months at UCSD.

Tuesday, September 19, 1995 

On Aug. 18, the American public wit~ 
nessed firsthand the hypocrisy and immatu-
rity of one of the nation's two all-male, pub-
lic military institutions, The Citadel. As Sh-
annon FauIkDer, the first female ever admit-
ted to the school, departed from ClIarleston 
in tears, tbe male cadets danced and pranced 
around tbe courtyard, as if celebrating a 
battlefield victory over a fallen enemy. 

For nearly two yean, defenders of The 
Citadel's policy of excluding women cited 
the school's fundamental purpose of prepar-
ing for war as juatification for Faulkner's 
ostracization. War made no concession to 
weiker, female soldiers, tbey claimed, and 
neither could The Citadel. They were work-
ing to defend America, to sct in country's 
best interest of security. War preparation was 
the main focus. 

But when the cadets gathered in the court-
yard to celebrate their triumph, they clearly 
demonstrated that they are being taught far 
more than how to prepare for war. The issue 
goes beyond simple fraternization, beyond 
the ucamaraderie" that the "boys" develop 
at an all-male school. The cadets are being 
taught that women are inferior and that they 
cannot help defend the country. The cadets 
are being taught to hate women. If nothing 
else, Shannon Faulkner has alerted the 
American people to the inadequacy of one 
of their own publ ic military institutions. 

And the boltom line is that The Citadel is 
a public institution. Therefore, it cannot dis-
criminate against people based on sex. Simi-
larly, there should be no all-female institu-
tions funded by tax dollars. 

If The Citadel and the Virginia Military 
Institution (VMI) were .simply harmless 
boys' clubs with no further repercussions on 
American society, the issue would be much 
less complicated. 

But the effects extend well beyond the

Protest, Youn, Man 

Campus activism at UCSD usually goes 
right along with the lackluster social activity. 
Don't be fooled by those front-page pictures 
in the Guardiall - the ones showing hundreds 
of people protesting an action by the admin-
istration. 

U ually, we instruct our photographers to 
utilize everything in their repertoi res to make 
it look like there are hordes of angry people.

COMMENTARY: Shanrwn Faulkner's exitfrom The

ASSOCIATE OPINION EDITOR 

walls of thC$Cl institutions, as The Citadel's 
cadets sadly demonstrated. Most importantly, 
and most noticeably, The 
Citadel fosters a misogy-
nistic attitude. It teaches 
that women are incapable 
of serving in the military in 
any capacity. 

they have been taught that women must be 
excluded at all costs. 

Many Citadel support-
ers argue that this is not the 
case. They contend that 
The Citadel only acknowl-
edges women's physical in-
feriority and nothing more, 
and that the cadets can dis-
tinguish between physical 
capabilities and other mili-
tary functions. 

However, this argument 
is wrong. If it were true, the 
cadets would not have cel-
ebrated Faulkner's depar-
ture so ostentatiously. 
Fau Ikner 's departure 
should be seen as part of 
the process of weeding out

cadets who quH at 
the same time. 

The Citadel sbould 
eliminate ita poli<:y of ex-
cluding women. Including 
women would not damage 
the morale of the troops nor 
hinder our military pre-
paredness. If the cadets at 
The Citadel are bothered by 
the presence of women, 
then the cadets are the prob-
lem, not the women. The 
United States wants the 
most capable, intelligent 
soldiers in its military; but 
anyone who beli~ves that 
women compromise the 
military'S efficiency is not 
intelligent and does not be-
long in the military in the 
first place. 

While The Citadel does 
more than simply develop 
soldiers for the military, it 
also discriminates against 
women by not allowing 
them th~ same opportuni-

dets who quit at the same time. Instead, the 
cadets cheered Faulkner's exodus because 

Just as David Copperfield uses those tricky 
camera angles to make the Statue of Liberty 
vanish, our highly skilled Guardian photog-
raphers are trained to do the opposite - to 
make people appear out of thin air. 

Read the story; if it says there were ufjve 
students protesting ... ," then that sounds about 
right. 

One depressing thing you, young freshman, 
will soon realize is that no matter how angry 
you get about rising fees, you're still a pawn 
of the powerful UC regents. T~e regents take 
our money and do with it as they please -with 
or without loud students yell ing in their ears. 

Just check the odds on each regent·meet-
ing vote. 'tWenty-four regents. One student 
regent. Hmm. 
Anoc:lated Chaos 

If there is one group at UCSD that re-
sembles an acc!dent waiting to happen, it is 
the A.S. The Guardiull would be filled with 
crossword puzzles and.Dear Abby" columns 

ties as men in South Carolina's business com-
munity. Graduation from The Citadel virtu-

if it weren 't for the wacky hijinks of this stu-
dent-government organization. 

Nearly every candidate's campaign in re-
cent years has been awash in scandal. lIIegal 
flyers, non-students running for office and 
five- percent voter turnout are mainstays of 
A.S. elections. 

II has been so bad tha t last year, the Guard-
iall gave a Uthumbs up" - of Siskel and Ebert 
fame - to the A.S. because it was the first 
election in decades that didn't result in a law-
suit or a filed complaint. 

And then, one newly elected officer had 
to resign because of violations. And then, two 
more current A.S. officers quit before this year 
began. The hit parade continues. 
Gettlne Involved 

But despite its problems and quirks, UCSD 
is still a top-notch university in many respects. 
And this is not due to its prestigious faculty, 
highly touted science programs or architec-
hlially acclaimed buildings. 

OPINION 9 

ally guarantees a secure job witb signiflClnt 
social power in ClIarieston. As the situation 
stands, only men are afforded these oppor-
tunities. When public institutions perpetuate 
tbis problem, it requires immediate repair. 

While it is much harder to work for gen-
der equality in private spheres, The Citadel's 
problem is more easily fixed because it falls 
into the public sector. Ending discrimination 
against women will begin the proc:as of dis-
mantling discrimination in both sectors. 

Still, acceptance of women sbould not re-
quire The Citadel to lower its standards of 
physical fitness. The Citadel's officers are 
correct to argue that war makes no conces-
sions for weaker soldiers. The Citadel should 
not IICCCpt • lower lC'le\ of pbyU::al pedor-
mance. The requirements should remain tbe 
same. and ifany woman can ..... ,.... tJaea 
sbe should be accepted. If it happens that 95 
percent of those wbo pus the tests are men, 
so be it. The Citadel would still be produc-
ing the best possible soldiers. 

Lowering the physical standards, as The 
Citadel did for Faulkner, defeats the purpose 
of the institution. The Citadel and the Ameri-
can public should be able to distinguish be-
tween discrimination based on gender and 
discrimination based on physical prowess-
the latter of which the military must continue 
to practice. 

Unfortunately, Faulkner's early departure 
from The Citadel has attracted as much at-
tention as her entrance. But whether she 
failed or succeeded has little to do with the 
issues at stake. If she had succeeded, prefer-
ably with the normal physical requir~ments 
rather than the lowered ones, The Citadel 
would have had one more qualified cadet. 

Sadly, groups on both sides of the issue 
immediately interpreted 'Faulkner's depar-
ture as representative of far more than simple 

See FAULKNER, Page 20 

The reason UCSD maintains a standard of 
high quality is its students. Yes, that's right, 
because of the people who actually pay to keep 
the university running and fill its classrooms. 

Incoming UCSD students are normally at 
the top of their high school classes, achieve 
stellar SAT scores and are involved in extra-
curricular activities. It is you, young fresh-
men, who make this campus work. 

Consequently, it is important that you get 
involved at UCSD - whether it's playing 
basketball for the Tritons, serving time on the 
A.S. or selling nachos at RIMAC. 

And if, by chance, you should happen to 
possess writing skills ohny caliber, then stop 
by the Guardian office above the old Student 
Center. Who knows? You could be the next 
Walter Winchell or Bob Woodward. 

Or you could just write Guardian opinion 
articles about how bisexuality is a farce, or 
how Jesse Jackson is the leader for the 19905, 
or how gun control is repressive, or how ....

10 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Tuesday, September 19, 1995 

COMMENTARY: Not only is the Christian Coalition's skewed and limited world view irrational 
and fanatical, it threatens the right to privacy 

BLASTING THE BIBLE-THUMPING BUFFOONS 
By Kathl .. n Lytle 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Lock up the faggots, keep the 
bitches pregnant and put prayer 
back in school. Then we'll be on our 
way back to the "good ole days." 
The Christian Coalition intends to 
return this country to its puritanical 
roots. If you are gay, lesbian, bi-
sexual, female or not Christian, the 
rhetoric of the Christian Coalition 
should settle somewhere between 
frightful and hilarious. 

The Christian Coalition's ulti-
mate goal - to fuse religion and 
government policy - would prove 
to be alienating and oppressive to 
many groups. We are not a nation 
of one homogeneous fabric. The 
laws of the land allow for diversity 
of opinion. Private lives are just that 
- private. We cannot limit what 
someone chooses to do with his 
body or how he wishes 10 express 
feelings with another consenting 
adult. 

The most unsettling dichotomy 
of the Christian Coalition's ideol-
ogy is made clear in its stance on 
homosexuality. It proclaims that 
gays and lesbians break all codes of 
morality and tear apart our nation's 
strength. The hopes of many in the 
Christian Right to further 
criminalize homosexuality are irra-
tionaland fanatical. 

If homosexuality were an ob-
struction to social stability, this na-
tion would have fallen years ago. 
The Christian Coalition has not ac-

cepted homosexuality as a state of 
being, but has instead defined it by 
a set of aets - sodomy, oral copu-
lation and other sexual practices. 
Even if one were to concede to the 
coalition's definition of homosexu-
ality, how can one criminalize acts 
which occur between consenting 
adults in the privacy of their homes? 

Perhaps we could compile an 
"FBI Five Million Most Wanted 
List" for suspected gays and lesbi-
ans and then perform raids on 
homes across America. Or maybe 
during each census, we could add a 
question such as, "Have you prac-
ticed sodomy or oral copulation 
during the last 10 years? If so, please 
clasp your hands on top of your head 
and turn around slowly while we 
read you your Miranda rights." 

If the question were answered 
honestly, many members of the 
Christian Coalition would find 
themselves arrested, tried and sen-
tenced for homosexuality. 

If we were able to limit arrests 
to actual gays and lesbians, then we 
would still have to justify 
criminalizing the actions between 
consenting adults. The Bible cannot 
be used as a defense. The relation-
ship between an individual and God 
is private. If God has a problem with 
how people lead their lives, I think 
God has the wisdom and power to 
handle it. We, as citizens of this na-
tion, do not have the right to con-
trol private lives. To put it simply: 
It's none of our business. 

Ask you .... lf, "Who 
.... plilaged, 
raped, murdered 
and robbed allover 
the globe In the 
name of God-
band. of gay. or 
annl .. of 
Christi •• ?" If we 
feel the need to 
vilify one group 
over another, 
which one would 
you pick? 

While ~Iaring its intentions to 
protect private lives, the Christian 
Coalition Wlnts only to protect the 
privacy of those who agree with its 
ideology, while silencing those who 
do not. These tactics are not new to 
the Christian Right. 

Christianity's embracers have 
used the Bible to their advantage for 
centuries. The persecution of Jews 
had been defended by the rhetoric 
of protecting Christianity. Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. used moral 
shame rooted in Ouistian principles 
to drive the Civil Rights Movement. 
Slave masten used Christian prin-
ciples as the primary justification 
for slavery. With 20/20 hindsight, 
we are able to see the absurdity of 
these arguments and the best way 
to correct the past is to avoid repeat-
ing the same mistakes. 

We cannot allow the Christian 
Right to institutionalize its preju-
dices by oppressing gays and lesbi-
ans. While oppression takes many 
forms, the faulty defense of "pro-
tecting the canons of Christianity" 
has been used throughout history. In 
America, gays and lesbians are sim· 
ply the contemporary target. 

These words should not be taken 
as a slam against Christianity, but 
rather as a challenge against those 
who use the Bible to justify their 
own insecurities, prejUdices and 
oppressive actions. Ask younelf, 
"Who has pillaged, raped, murdered 
and robbed allover the globe in the 
name of God - bands of gays or 
armies of Christians?" If we feel the 
need to vilify one group over an-
other, which one would you pick? 

When we hear the rhetoric of in· 
fusing God or good Christian prin-
ciples into the government, we must 
be wary. The Golden Rule has yet 

to be translated into equal protec-
tion under the law, and juries still 
carry out their vengeance across the 
land. 

Do not be fooled by mindless 
jl!bbering, such as that of right-~ing 
presidential candidate Alan Keyes. 
Just because the Christian Right has 
female and black supporters, it does 
not mean that its ideas do not 
threaten the freedom and well-be-
ing of these groups. The individual 
opportunism of people like Keyes 
would be acceptable if we no longer 
embraced sexism and racism, but 
we do. 

Allhough there are many strate-
gies in the struggle for civil rights, 
the Christian Coalition does not al· 
low for freedom of thought, nor 
does it wish to break from tradi-

. tional gender and race relations. 
The Christian Coalition wishes 

to make this country look like it did 
during the 19505. For the average 
straight, middle-class white male, 
this would be fine. But for every-
one else, that decade was a hell on 
Earth. Women were chained to the 
kitchen and low-paying jobs. Blacks 
lived under the Jim Crow laws. Ho-
mosexuals were banished to the out-
skirts of society. Senator Joseph 
McCarthy persecuted those who did 
not maintain the status quo. During 
the '50s, oppression and terror kept 
white men in control of the bedroom 
and the boardroom. 

We live in the '90s. We must not 
go .back.

lAYOFFS: 
Union cites other 
factors as cause 
ContInued from ,... • 
around, given the fact that employ-
ees at the plant recieved $5-10 per 
hour less than they would have on 
the outside," Kalmijn added. 

According to UPTE, an organi-
zation representing the interests of 
technical employees on campus, ad-
ministrators wanted to contract the 
shop out to TCS (Thomas Charles 
Stiples), a Los-Angeles based com-
pany, early last year. 

"The sale would have seriously 
affected the quality of services for 
the university," said Tom Williams, 
a former print shop employee. "The 
employees would be too busy doing 
commercial work." 

But Kalmijn and Williams im-
plied that other factors were in-
volved in the proposed sale to TCS. 
UPTE members assert that UC 
Regent Clair Burgener sat on the 
company's board.of directors, and 
that Brian Powell, former man-
ager of the print shop, worked for 
TCS as a c.onsultant. 

"It was a major conflict of inter-
est," Kalmijn said. "After we went 
to the regents about itthey called Ihe 
deal off in the summer of 1994," 
Kalmijn said. 

Hug refused to comment on the 
allegations against"the adminis-
tration . 

Another conflict arose between 
UPTE and adminstrators when the 
accounting firm Coopers and 
Lybrand was called in to evaluate 
the print shop's productivity. 

According to Kalmijn, the em-
ployees were not given access t.o the 
firm's report until just recently. 

Kalmijn said he was most frus-
trated about the way the administra-
tion kept the employees in the dark 
about the status of the operation. 

"This is an example of the 
university 's callous approach toward 
its employees," he said. "By con-
tracting out university jobs, 'we are 
laying off people with house pay-
ments and kids in college, [people) 
who are a part of the community." 

RANKINGS: 
Results also apply 
to undergraduates 
Continued from INC- 1 
port is based on data from partici-
pating universities, national data-
bases and a survey of nearly 8,000 
faculty members. 

"The quality of a university's 
faculty is the primary determinant 
of the excellence of all its academic 
endeavors," said UCSD Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson. 

"This survey hasplaccdusfirmly 
in the company of some of the very 
finest and oldest academic institu-
tions in the country," he said. 

Although the col!ncil studied only 
graduate programs, Vice Chancel-
lor for Research/Dean of Graduate 
Studies Richard Attiyeh believes the 
results are important to undergradu-
ates as well . 

"A major factor in the quality of

Caserio Named Acting Chancellor 
SEARCH: UCSD will not have permanent replacement until 1996 
By Slmo ... Miller 
Senior Staff Writer 

Ma~orie C. Caserio, who re-
cently retired after her five-year ten-
ure as vice chancellor of academic 
affairs, was appointed Friday by the 
UC Board of Regents as UCSO's 
interim chancellor. 

Caserio, 66, will take over indefi-
nitely for outgoing Chancellor Rich-
ard Atkinson, who will leave UCSO 
at the end of the month to become 
president of the UC system. 

A search committee will be ap-
pointed to find a permanent chancel-
lor, although the position is not ex-
pected 10 be filled until June 1996. 

"The search for a new chancellor 
is really a lengthy process," Attiyeh 
said. "It will be a long time before 
we can even review the applicants." 

Caserio, who is on vacation, was 
unavailable for comment. 

In addition to serving as a UCSD 
vice-chancellor, Caserio was also a 
chemistry professor at UCSO. 

Before her job at UCSD, Caserio 
taught for 25 years at UC Irvine - _ 
and, while there, authored several 
textbooks. 

Caserio, who was chair of the 
UC Academic Senale from 1985-
86, also served as the faculty repre-
sentative to the UC Board of Re-
gents from 1984-86. 

some very difficult budgetary crises, 
and she sua:ceded at keeping our 
programs going," Lindenberg said. 

She added that Caserio's teach-
ing experience would make her 
aware of faculty and student needs. 

"It's wonderful to have an edu-
cator in an administrative position, 
and she has always been concerned 
with holding the administration ac-
countable for the educational as-
pects," Lindenberg said. 

Vice Chancellor for Research! 
Dean of Graduate Studies Richard 
Attiyeh was also please.d with 
Caserio's appointment. 

"Marjorie has lots of experience 
and has proven herself to be an out-
standing administrator," he said. 

NEWS 15 

UCSD faculty, alumni and stu-
dents will be involved in the candi-
date inlerviews and discussions. 
Atkinson will then make the final 
recommendation for a permanent 
chancellor to the UC Board of Re-
gents. 

She has played an active role in 
the university since her arrival in 
1990, establishing new majors 
such as women's studies, ethnic 
sludies and a doctorate in math-
ematics and science education, as 
well as raising more than $1 mil-
lion dollars for graduate student 
fellowships. 

Katja Lindenberg, chair of Ihe 
biochemistry department, said 
Caserio was a "wonderful choice" 

"She has maintained niorale in 
the face of difficult problems, such 
as the budget cuts," Attiyeh added. 
"She is really an excellent choice." 

With more cutbacks in state fund-
ing for the UC system expected this 
year, Caserio will be responsible for 
helping UCSD survive some poten-
tially harsh economic conditions.

Color-blind system 
deemed impractical

COntInued from ,... 1 
that we are dividing ourselves in 
America along racial lines, not one 
nation indivisible.· 

According to the San Francisco 
Chronicle, after the vote, Governor 
Pete Wilson lauded the new policy. 

"The adoption of[tbese measures] 
says California's diversity should be 
achieved nalurallyralherthan tbrough 
preferenca, " Wilson said 

At the July 20 meeting, the UC 
Board of Regents voted 14 to 10 to 
end affirmative action in admissions 
and in a separate decision, voted 15 
to 10 to stop affirmative action in 
university hiring and contracting. 

The new policy adopted by Ihe 
regents says that, effective Jan. 1, 
1997, the uni~ersity "shall not use 
race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity 
or national origin" as factors in ad-
missions. The policy is indentical 
for hiring and awarding contracts, 
with aneffectivedateoUan. 1,1996. 

Also written into Ihe policy is a 
stipulation which slates that as of 
January I, 1997, between 50 and 75 
percent oflhe freshman class at each 
campus will be admitted SQlely on 
the basis of academic achievement. 

Currently, 40-00 percent of UC 
students are admitted based entirely 
on academic merit, while the re-
mainder are judged both on grades 
and supplemental factors, including 
race and special skills. 

Affirmative-action supporters 
have said that while a "color-blind" 
admissions system sounds fair in 
theory, il doesn't take into consider-
ation the real obstacles faced by mi-
norities. 

"We don't live in a color blind 
society," said Falk. "The only way 
we can achieve diversily [at the uni-
versity :evel] is if we look at K-12 
education and provide the same re-
sources t.o high schools whether Ihey 
are in Watts or Beverly Hills." 

The UC system, which recently 
has been al the center of the debate 
over affirmative action, is comprised 
of 162,000 sludents. The lJC sludent 
population is 52 percent white, 23 
percent Asian, 12 percent Hispanic 
and 4 percent African-American.

CUL Stacks Renamed 
To 'ReOect Contents 
CHANGE: 1Wo-thirds of the CUL collection is 
now the Social Sciences and Humanities Library 
By M.c aonz.a.. 
Guardian Reporter 

While big changes are taking 
place across UCSD, including the 
const.ruction of Library Walk and 
Center Hill, another important cam-
pus landmark is undergoing a less 
obvious aUeration. 

The Central University Library 
(CUL), which also houses the Sci-
ence and Engineering Library and 
Special Collections materials, is 
going through a name change of 
sorts. 

While the overall building name 
will remain the same, two-thirds of 
the CULcollections, approximately 
one million of its 1.5 million hold-
ings, have been reclassified as the 
new Social Sciences and Humani-
ties Library. 

When a' student checks out a 
book on St. Augustine or African-
American history, it will be from 
the Social Sciences & Humanities 
Library, a new subdivision of It he 
larger UCSD University Library 
system. 

The new humanities designation 
will comprise the majority of the 
central library, while the Science 
and Engineering Library will re-
main in the east wing. 

The change was part of an over-
all plan to classify each UCSD li-
brary ac:cording to its subject mat-

paid for 

ter. The Biomedical Library and 
Science and Engineering Library 
were already named after their re-
spective disciplines, but a library 
for humanities books had not yet 
been designated. 

A library oversight committee, 
whose members include the library 
head, certain staff members and the 
library's computer systems corps, 
decided that a change in name was 
necessary, because the CUL stacks 
reflected the social sciences and hu-
manities. 

"[The CULl was renamed so it 
conveys to people what Irea it cov-
ers," said Virginia Steel, director of 
the newly named library Ind com-
mittee member. 

Steel, who is responsible for li-
brary operations, circulation, refer-
ence and publicity of the library's 
new moniker, hopes thlt this will 
not create confusion for students 
and faculty. 

"Publicizing this information ... 
will help to make a smooth transi-
tion," she said. 

Despite the name; change, no 
books or articles were brought in or 
moved out, and the special collec-
tions which the CUL is known for 
- including Dr. Seuss, the univer-
sity archives and the Hill collection 
of 16th-19th century PacifIC voy-
ages - have stayed intact.

FAULKNER: 
Cadets learning 

. the wrong lesson 
ContInued from .,... 9 
failure. The entire incident repre-
sents the quasi-victories won by 
gender activists who view the en-
tire incident as a political and femi-
nist issue. Defenders of The Cita-
del contend it proves that women 
are not fit to serve alongside the 
male cadets. But one woman's fail-
ure does not disqualify other 
women. 

If Faulkner's failure shows any-
thing beyond her physical inad-
equacy, it reveals, once again, that 
The Citadel's cadets are taught to 
hate women. After all, Faulkner 
cited severe mental and emotional 
stress due to constant harassment 
by the male cadets. Listening to ca-
dets whining about female inferi-
ority does nothing to prepare this 
country for war . 

The Citadel needs to end its dis-
crimination against women. But it 
should not lower its requirements 
simply for physically inferior 
people to succeed. There are hun-
dmIs of jobs in the military for men 
and women alike who cannot meet 
The Citadel's physic:al standards. 

Although Shannon Faulkner 
was not physically qualified for 
The Citadel, her struggle revealed 
the gross inadequacies of one of 
America's premier public military 
institutions.

SUMMER 1995 

Snapshots from summer camp, 1995 

he Chargers are sort of a UCS,D institution for about six weeks 
every summer~ike any other sub-contracted consultant 
peddling their wares on campus. They first showed up in 1976, 
and over the years owner Alex Spanos has built some nice 
facilities for them to use. We get them the rest of the year. If you 
pop out of RIMA C (Spanos didn't build .that) after your 
racquetball game, you might catch a glimpse of old John 
Parrella there, whose lunch weighs more than you do. 

Junior Seau, who s more famous than Chancellor 
Atkinson, may .ask you where to get a cool drink. These 
guys were on the field in a Super Bowl (Hey, lets not get 
into that-this is a new season), and now they're asking 
you how to get to El Torito.

UC Regents Abolish 
Affirmative Action 

On July 20th the University of Califor-
nia Board of Regents meeting in San 
Francisco ended in a historic decision to 
overturn affirmative action practices in 
admissions and hiring. The 14-10 vote 
ended the use of race and gender as a 
factor in admissions and was passed 
despite the objection of University 
President Jack W. Peltason and the nine 
UC campus chancellors, including UCSD's 
Richard Atkinson. 

The regents decision means that the next 
group of UC applicants in the fall of 1996 
will be the last admitted under the current 
system that allows race to be considered as 
one factor. Affirmative action practices in 
hiring and contracting will be phased out 
even sooner-by the end ofthis year. 

The Rev. Jesse Jackson led a group of 
aboutloo protesters, who disrupted the meet-
ing. The decision may mean that UCSD will 
expand recruitment programs targeting mi-
norities and the poor, but there is some feel-
ing that minority sludents may reject UC 
campuses on principle because of this vote. 
Note: The UCSD Guardian's Welcome Wltk 
Issue on September 19th will feature ex-
tended staff coverage of this mlttlng and

UCSD's W ALSHOK SEES THE 
FuTuRE: UNIVERSfI'IES 

CONNECTING WITH SOCIETY 
In the increasingly Information-drlven society of the 21st 

century, the country's best research universities will come 
dOWD from the Ivory tower to become the primary dispensers 
of knowledge to all segments of society, according to Mary 
Walshok, an adjunct professor of sociology and aSSOCiate VIce 
chancellor of extended studies and publiC service. 

Walshok is author of the new book "Knowledge without 
Boundaries: What America's Research Universities Can Do for 
the Economy, the Workplace, and the Community.· She areues 
that the research university of the future must be more than 
inventor/innovator/gatherer and depository of Information. It 
must go beyond this traditional role by providing society with 
practical knowledge that can be used across all secments of 
society. The goal is Information that educates and retrains the 
workforce, offers technical and academic expertise to busI-
nesses, provides continuing education to seniors and other 
non-students, and Informs people on public policy Issues. 

In her book, Walshok points out how some of the country's 
research universities already have programs aimed at connect-
ingthelrworkto SOCiety. UCSD'sown CONNECT program Is one 

of them. CONNECT creates ~ ;l~ C~ECT portunltles for high-tech entrepre-
neurs, university faculty and re-

searchers, and business service providers to meet. They 
provide technical, finanCial, and managerial skills and assis-
tance to small businesses; technical briefings and education 
about high-tech products; sophisticated marketing guidance 
for service providers from traditional backgrounds; and they 
help increase awareness of Issues affecting the high-tech 
industry. 

Opinion pollster Daniel Yankelovich and leading academics 
agree with Walshok's assessment. Yankelovlch states that 
her examples "demonstrate the capabilities that research 
universities have to generate, interpret, and link knowledge to 
the complex economic, organizational and community chal-
lenges that confront advanced industrial societies ••

THE MATrER WITH KIps TODAY 
BY JEFF NIESE_L ur ummer 

virgins he has seduced: Kids these days. From one per-
spective, they ride skateboards, have 
unprotected sex and smoke pot, es-
sentially doing nothing but creating 
havoc on city streets. Larry Clark's 
film Kids isabout"kids these days," 
and it may just be the most contro-
versial film of the summer. 

The sexist dialogue between 
Telly and Casper is countered with 
a scene in which a group of girls 
complain about the way boys treat 
them. Concerned that they may have 
contracted a disease from having 
unprotected sex, Jennie (Chloe 
Sevigny) a,nd Ruby (Rosario 
DawsOn) go to a clinic to get tested. 
Even though Jennie has only slept 
with Telly, she has contracted the 
HIV virus. The news shakes her, 
and she sets out to find Telly. 

, \ 
For gOQd measure throw in a catch 
phrase for the audience (the unin-
spired "I knew you were going to 
say that") and a comic sidekick. In 
that capacity, Rob Schneider's 
snappy patter is pretty pedestrian, 
and makes one look at Rich the 
copier guy with a freshly jaundiced 
eye.

Clark's film essentially repre-
sents every parent's worst night-
mare. The kids in KidS steal, lie and 
cheat, and the film offers no moral 
stance from which to criticize their 
actions. In some ways, the lack of a 
moral center is upsetting, particu-

, larly when violence b~eaks out. But 
the amoral approach of the film is 
perhaps the best way of depicting 
the world in which these inner-city 
teenagers live. Clark, a well known 
photographer, set out to make a re-
alistic movie about skateboard-
riding teenagers, even culling ac-
tors from the streets of New York. 
Himself a skater (he learned to skate 
when his son turned nine), Clark has 
achieved an authentic, documentary 
feel to the film, which is based on a 
script by Harmony Korine. 

As. the film opens, Telly (Leo 
Fitzpatrick) is deflowering yet an-
other virgin. He uses his rhetorical 
skills to convince a young girl (Sa-
ra h Henderson) that he tru I y loves 
her and no one else. We soon learn 
how much Telly lies, as he meets his 
friend Casper (Justin Pierce) after-
ward and brags about the number of

Sly Stallone usually lets his 
gats and his fists do the talkin' , 
so the firefights are pretty much 
up to snuff here. Some of these 
sci-fi action flicks are getting so 
technically proficient-morphing, 
computer animation, etc,- that 
stimulation has replaced such 
anachronisms as plot, tenSion, 
climax, and literate dialogue. All 
you comic buffs aside, that's 
what's happening in Judge Dredd.

Based rather loosely on Michael 

Crichton'S best seiling novel, 
Congo is a Hollywood-style return 
to the mysteries of Africa, a wan-
derlust that recalls such classics 
as King Solomon's Mines. Ernie 
Hudson takes a Tim Curry-led group 
of diamond hunters and two go-
rilla experts on an expedition to _ 
the ancient city of Zinj. They pull 
off many a narrow escape from a 
seemingly endless horde of very 
vicious, very scary gray gorillas 
guarding the gates of Zinj. The 
climactic battle between gorilla 
and humans Is unforgettable. 

Often predictable, yet exciting 
enough, Congo lacks the dread 
laden suspense of Marshall's ear-
lier efforts (Anachrophobla, Alive) 
and even some of Crichton's other 
works. 

The reliable Hudson and 01>-
noxious Curry are upstaged by the 
hysterical antics of a talking go-
rilla named Amy. In fact, through-
out Congo, the apes steal the 
show from the unchallenged, 
"primitive" cast. Designed by Sam 
Winston of Aliens and Jurassic 
Park fame, the gorillas alone are 
well worth the ticket. 

Ray Rodriquez 

Apollo 13 
Director Ron Howard is the mas-

ter at portraying the triumph of 
human will in movies like Bsckdraft 
and Far and Away. Apollo 13, the 
story of a flawed space mission 
thattumed into NASA's finest hour, 
is Howard's most triumphant film 
yet. 

Tom Hanks, as Apollo com-
mander Jim Lovell, leads a stellar 
cast In this loosely wound nail 
biter. The story focuses not only 
on the cramped psyches of the 
three astronauts but on the pains-
taking efforts of Houston control 
to get them home after equi pment 
malfunction. Kevin Bacon and Bill 
Paxton round out the Apollo crew, 
and Gary Sinise follows his excel-
lent Forrest Gump role with a wor-
thy tum as grounded pilot Ken 
Mattingly . 

The real star is the emotional 
performance of Ed Harris as 
Houston's main troubleshooter. 
Look for cameos by most of the 
director's family, including a great 
"washing machine" line by mother 
Howard. 

Dynamite special effects (par-
ticularly the lift off) and a thunder-
ous score enhance the drama. 
The smart, sometimes witty script 
makes the action accessible and 
does not rely too heavily on tech-
nical jargon.

Who is that unlisted band back-
ing Neil Young on his latest re-
lease? Why, it's Pearl Jam, even 
though the band appears nowhere 
on the album cover and is only 
listed in the credits on the liner 
notes. Apparently, Pearl Jam's 
label, Epic Records, didn't want 
the band listed on the album. 

You can hardly go wrong pair-
ing Neil Young, a veteran rock 
guitarist and singerwho has never 
gone out of style, with Pearl Jam, 
the alternative band which has 
set records for al@um sales. De-
spite the help of his new, young 
friends, Mirror Ball sounds like a 
Neil Young 'album. The songs 
"Downtown" and "Act of Love" 
perhaps have more of a bite to 
them, but on the whole, Mirror 
Bal/has the same enduring quali-
ties which characterize Young's 
rock-oriented albums like Free-
dom and Ragged Glory.

The Circle Jerks may have been 
one of the premiere punk bands 
when they formed in 1980. At that 
time, the Circle Jerks received the 
same praise as Black Flag and 
Bad Religion. Yet the band's new 
album, Oddities, Abnormalities 
and Curiosities is curiously bland. 
Singer Keith Morris imitates former 
Sex Pistol John Lydon in an annoy-
ing manner, and if it weren't for 
the dueling guitars of Greg Hetson 
and Zander Schloss, there would 
be little of redeeming value on 
Oddities. 

One notable oddity: sugary teen 
idol Debbie Gibson and veritable 
riot grrrt Suzi Gardner of the band 
L 7 trade backing vocals on the 
Jerks' cover of the Soft Boys' "I 
Wanna Destroy You." Unfortu-
nately, it's difficult to distinguish 
their vocals, and the track, which 
promises to be an intriguing com-
bination of opposites, is a let-
down.

With its last album Grave Dancer's 
Union, Soul Asylum effectively left many 
of its longtime fans disenchanted. It's not 
just that the album was a hit - much of 
the material was much slower and more 
melodic than previous releases. Yet, even 
though the Minneapolis-based band 
doesn't play with the 'same raw energy, it 
keeps sounder better and better with 
each album. 

The single "Misery" is a catchy pop 
tune in which Pirner makes fun of the 
manufacture and marketing of ennui. "To 

" My Own Devices" is essentially a country 
track, featuring melodic guitar work, and "Promises Broken" (co-
written by Jayhawks' bassist Marc Perlman) almost sounds like a 
James Taylor song. Soul Asylum can still play with reckless energy, 
however. The songs "Shut Down" and" Just Like Anyone" pack a 
serious wallop.

nil, Review Begins 

Jeff N\eseI 

It's been so long since Michael Jackson was not the most 
overwritten about, overidolized, overscrutinized and overwrought 
pop star in history, it's hard to remember when he was merely an 
artist. 

In 1979, after people gave Off the Wall a listen, no one in 
American pop music offered more promise. He took the surprising 
poise and spark shown in Jackson Five hits like "I Want You Back" 
and "I'll Be There" to a new mature level. He created a hybrid of 
james Brown-gritty R&B and slick, super productiontpop. His uptempo 
songs ("Don't Stop Til You Get Enough" is the standard bearef') made 
you dance. His ballads, with an emotional commitment that owed a 
nod to Jackie Wilson, made you cry. On "She's Out Of My Life" his 
voice actually does crack at the end . 

In 1982, Thriller hit-a massive global phenomenon that dwarfed 
Sinatra, Elvis, the Beatles, pretty much all prior recording history. 
Aborigines played it on Friday nights. Thriller was another artis.tic 
breakthrough-particularly "Billie Jean" which introduced such an 
original catalog of popping rhythms and breathless soul yelps that it 
nearly reinvented pop. The advent of MTV by this time brought a 
another new language of pop culture" and Jackson was a pioneer of 
that, too. Later, he and many other artists came to confuse video 
chops with the real artistry-writing and producing good songs. But 
the "King of POpTM" he did become. 

And there's the rub-Jackson started winning 
Grammies, setting Guinness records (all dutifully 
listed in the liner notes of HIStory) and developing 
a world class ego. He earned the ego and had the 
talent to back it up, but the tabloids started poring 
over him like he 'was the Zapruder film. By sheer 
volume of printer's ink worldwide, his generosity, 
his peculiarities, his excesses became larger than 
those of mere earthlings. And his falls (what fallsl) 
were media events. 

The talent, of course, never waned. and in 1987 
Bad was also a world wide hit. Stunning moments 
like "Man in the Mirror" matched the drama of his best work. 
Dangerous (1990) also had its high points. "Black ~nd White" was 
danceable, and like Prince 'he started adding rappers to the mix. 
"Heal the World" is the quintessential Jackson ballad, a little sappy 
but touching. As always, accompanying videos were innovative and 
expensively filmed, usually overshadowing the music. 

ThIs Review COntInues 
The release of a greatest hits collection along with a substantial 

amount of brand new music (here it's exactly half and half) Is always 
a tricky business. The new stuff risks not being up to the comparison.

Unfortunately, that is the case 
here. By Dangerous, there was 
already noticeable filler-funky, 
syncopated, but filler nonethe-

"Leave Me Alone" on

and "Tabloid Junkie" 
are similarly whin~ 
with an uncharacteris-

"Scream," a duet with sister 
Janet, is surprisingly 
undanceable, full of starts and 
stops. It personifies the typical 
Michael Jackson dilemma. The 
song is weak, but much attention 
was given to producing the crazy, 
controversial video. Musically 
there Is no reason for Janet to be 
there, but she adds a stark visual 
presence and a family solidarity. 

The best moments (all bal-
lads) are pleasant-as in merely 
pleasant. Fair enough, but this is 
the guy that sold Thriller to the 
Aborigines. "Earth Song" has 
ethereal, layered harmonies on 
the chorus that create a Beach 
Boys-like warmth. "You Are Not 
Alone" stands out from every-
thing around it because of its 
understated production, featur-
ing acoustic guitars. It's "Heal 
the World" meets Mariah Carey. 
The lyriCS to "Childhood," as well 
as illustrations shown in the liner 
notes, suggest that a warped 
childhood made him the eccen- .' 
tric he is known as today. A cover 
of Charlie Chaplin's "Smile" is 
moving, but sounds a little too 
much like a valedictory. 

Can this be the end of the King

stuff and crank out one whole

10 The UCSD~dian SUMMER 1995 
, The Chargers (.t',,) 1994 was like a 

dream .. . its now over seven 
months since Dennis Gibson 
batted down that pass in Pitts-
burgh, and you can still see light-
ning bolts on people's cars. 
Everybody loves a winner, and 
San Diego hasoft~n been called 
a front-runner town. That is, 
major league sports cities have 
fanatjcs who will sellout stadi-
ums to see inept Cubs or medio-
cre Broncos, but only in Fat 
City do San Diegans fill Jack 
Murphy. 

CAN Bill MONTGOMERY (48) MAKE THE TEAMI 

MARK MONTREUil HOPES GOOD HANDS ARE A PREREQUISITE FOR TH E NFl. 

COACH CARL MAUCK, OfFENSIVE LINEMEN, TACKLING DUMMIES. 

Last season bought Gargan-
tuan goodwill and some of that 
big league fanaticism. If the 
Chargers stay contenders for a 
while (and the Bobbys Beat hard 
and Ross seem to be proven 
architects) San Diego will be 

one of those towns year in 
and year out. 

That first sip is always 
the sweetest, and the com-
ing out party at the stadium 
last January after the Steeler 
game shows how rabid these 
"laid backTII " San Diego 
fans can get. 

Lest we lose ourselves 
basking in reverie let 's get a 
grip on the reins-it was a 
conference championship. 
Not the Super Bowl. Prob-
ably no big whoop to the 
blase cosmopolites by the 
Bay (say, how was their at-
tendance in the lean years?), 
but it was ours. 

Chargers 
1995 Schedule 

(Regular season. Home games In CAPS. Comment. by a ian.) 

DATE OPPONENT 
Sun. SepL 3 8t Oakland 
Are relocated Raiders suddenly feeling Invincible again? A 
loss here may be tough to get over. 

Sun. Sept. 10 SEAnLE 
Better take this dog at home. 
Sun. Sept. 17 .. 8t Philadelphia 
Chargers are better team, but this has loss written allover it. 

Sun. Sept. 24 DENVER 
Is Shanahan the real deal? Should be revenge for last 
season's first loss. 

Sun. Oct. 1 8t Pittsburgh 
I tink da Steelers will be up for da game. 

Mon. Oct. 9 at Kan .. s City 
Better get some respect from the ABC guys. Monday Night 
against a good divisional foe--It don't get better than thisl 
Sun. Oct. 15 DALLAS 
Win this, guys, and we live like kings. 

Sun. Oct. 22 8t Seattle 
Caught a break last year by missing the damn Kingdome. 
Possible upset. 

Sun. Nov. 5 MIAMI 
We now officially own these guys. 
Sun. Nov. 12 KANSAS CITY 
This game is key-by this time they should be tuning up the 
playoff chops. Tough, but winnable. 
Sun. Nov. 19 8t Denver 
This or the Kingdome--one of 'ems in the toidy. 

Mon. Nov. 27 OAKLAND 
Did I say "it don't get better than this· in KC? Wrong! If the 
Chargers win this I'm gettin out the cigar-at a safe distance 
from the wife. 

Sun. Dec. 3 CLEVELAND 
What am I laffin' about? The Brownies are good. But 
Cleveland can't win here ... can they? 

Sat. Dec. 9 ARIZONA 
Buddy Ball should have deflated about now. 

Sun. Dec. 17 at Indlanapolla 
Junior, take care of Marshall. Any other business? 

S8t. Dec. 23 8t New York Giants 
Reeves may have them on the upswing, and it's bad to lose 
the last game of the year. Suck it up!

SUMMEa 1995 

Wluits in store for 
'951 Well, the cynical pundits pre-
dict that the Chargers probably 
won 't sneak up on many teams like 
last season, so they ' ll have a tougher 
go Ihis time. Well, hold on-riddle 
me this. In this modem day and age, 
when every NFL team is stocked 
with the best athletes, scouts, com-
puter databases to track every ten-
dency by every special teamer, can 
one team go through most of a 16-
game schedule and continue to sur-
prise better teams? That ease of 
schedule myth is something writers 
made up to fill space, in a similar 
fashion to the way this column is 
malerializing late on deadline night. 

Here 's how the Chargers can go 
to the Super Bowl-Natrone, come 
to camp. Stan Humphries, stay 
healthy, but don ' t lose that daring 
soul. Eric Moten, hope you 've got 
the chops. Jimmy Oliver, join our 
little band of overachiever receiv-
ers and catch that melon. Lewis 
Bush, fill the disciplined shoes and 
big heart of David Griggs. Junior, 
just keep doin' what you 've been 
doin'. That also goes for Carney, 
Coleman, Harper, Gordon, and the 
defensive line. Harmon, stay in there 
awhile. Bye-bye Sherrif and 
Carrington, but Bo Orlando, Shaun 
Gayle and Rodney Harrison, you 
guys hit somebody. Anybody. 

. See you at the Supcr Bow\.

HIATUS 2 

University Events 
Blings World to Campus 
Program features cutting-edge 

artists like Stomp 
ByJeffN ..... 
Hiatus Editor 

The University Events Office has 
always brought performers from 
around the globe to UCSD. But this 
year, the acts scheduled to perform 
seem to come from an even wider 
range of foreign places. 

"The point of our program is to 
bring the world to San Diego," said 
Ruth Baily, University Events Pr0-
gram coordinator. "The University 
Events Program has kind of evolved 
that way over the past five years. A lot 
of the artists will do master classes 
and workshops or work with univer-
sity professors while they're here. I 
Otink everyone who works in our of-
fice has an interest in making the 
world smaller." 

In fact, one of the most signifICant 
world music concerts to take place in 
San Diego will be sponsored by Uni-
versity Events. The Master Musicians 
of Jajouka, a group from a small vil-
lage near Morocco in Northern Africa 
was first discovered in the '60s by the 
Rolling Stones' Brian Jones. Jones 
recorded ThePipesofPan in 1968, an 
album now considered one of the first 
world music recordings. The group's 
first tour of the United States will 

include a stop at UCSD's Mandeville 
Auditorium on Nov. 5. 

Other acts from around the world 
include: Ballet Folklorico Nacional 
de Oile (Oct. 11), Echoes of Africa 
(Nov. 15), Ballet Folclorico De Brasil 
(May 3) and the Irish band Altan 
(March 10). 

In addition to the world music, the 
cuuing-edge artists on this year's pro-
gram should prove appealing to 
youngercrowlk The percussion group 
Stomp (Feb. 9-11) and dancer MarIe 
Morris (Nov. 3) are considered inno-
vators in their fields. 

Formed in England in 1991, Stomp 
has quickly become a popular group, 
selling out nearly all of the venues at 
which it performs. Using primitive 
"instruments," like garbage can lids, 
the ensembleaeates music from what-
ever it can find. 

"Probably everybody but stick-in-
the-muds will like Stomp," Baily said. 
"It started in l..ondoO where lJkly were 
street artists, and they just demolished 
brooms and janitorial supplies. It's 
.almost impossible to describe." 

The other culling-edge artist is 
Mark Morris, who hasn't appeared in 
San Diego with his dance group in 10 
years. Morris, whom Baily dcscn"bed 

-ru.day, SepeeInber 19,1995 

Dmce: Feld Ballets/NY will perform at 8 p.m. In Spreckels Theatre on April 17 and 18. 

IS "the bad ~y of dance," worked 
with Mikhail Barishnikovonhis White 
Oak Project. He is known for mixing 
music with dance and incorporating 
choreography not typically seen in 
balld productions. 

"We're doing bigger and better

PacifE Beach 
Area OIfers Choices for Stnden~ 
By Simone Miller 
S6nior StB/f Wrlt"r 

Restaurants, cafes and bars in Del Mar and La 
Jolla aU sIart to look the same after awhile. The 
choice- if you can qlllit that - between dining 
at moderately priced chains such as California 
Pizza Kitchen, Islands and Carlos Murphy's and 
the independently owned, but more expemive 
restaurants is hardly appealing. 

If you crave an atmosphere that isn't defined 
by rich retirees and tourists, head south for Pa-
cific Beach and Mission Bay. 

Although many consider PacifIC Beach (called 
"PB" by those in the know) a seedier option to La 
Jolla, it's really more of a "college town" than 
anything else in the area. Bars, coffee shops and 
small dives line the main street of Garnet; and on 
the weekend, the streets are teeming with anyone 
who wants to party and bas an ID that says you're . 
over 21 years of age. 

PB is the hip place for freshman and sopho-
mores to hang out, beca~ it offers late night 
coffee shops and bars that don't look too closely 
at IDs. And the restaurants here tend to offer what 
La Jolla can't: good food at a cheap price. 

Part o(PB's popularity stems from the fact 
that you can find more than the garden variety 
UCSD student here - local yokels and beach 
bums are an integral part of the PB scene. The 
best way to experience PB is to drive down 
Garnet on a Friday and Saturday nighl 
Restaurants 

FlOIppl's, 962 Garnet - This family-style 
Italian restaurant offers huge meals for a small 
price. Sample the lasagna and the ravioli dishes. 

Icbibaa, 1441 Gamet - This inexpensive 
Japanese restaurant is always packed, but the 
cafeteria serving-style ensures the wait is short. 
Sushi, ginger chicken and tempura are just sev-
eral of the delicious choices on the menu. 
Cafes 

CaleCrema, 1001 Garnet-Although the 
conversation is terrible (the music can be unbear-
ably loud), live performances make this cafe 
more exciting than the average server of joe. 
Open until 2 a.m., Cren,a is the perfect place to 
be the night before a final. 
Nlptclubs 

Schooaer's, 959 Hornblend Street -In ad-
dition to live music, this dance club~ offers a 
happy hour every night and $2 cocktails on 
Sunday. 

Society BUlards, 1051 Gamet- You don't 
have to play pool (and probably won't want to, 
given the high prices) to enjoy this club's mellow 
atmosphere. A good alternative to the dance 
clubs which line Gamel 

Qub Emerald Qty, 945 Garnet- This is 
the cheesiest bar in PB. The looks you get in this 
place will make you wonder if you're really a 

=~eal to CO 
The Mission Blvd. boardWalk at the end of 

Garnet will lead you right to the MIsIdoa Bay 
roller coaster, which for $ 1.50, offers a ride that 
will flip you upside down over the Pacific. 'Jbere 
are numerous shops along the boardwalk which 
rent rollerblades and bikes for decent prices, and 
if dodging pedestrian trafficdocsn't sound ideal, 
you can always lie on the beach and relax.

Contributing Writer 

It's theweekend, you're away from 
home for the first time, and you want 
to party down and get drunk. 
Revoluci6n Ave. in Tijuana has lots 
of bars, people and booze. 

It's also easy to find. Head south 
on 1-5 until you hit the border check-
point. You may either park on the 
U.S. side for anywhere from $5-7 and 
walk across or drive your car and park 
in the parking lots near Revoluci6n. 
You can take a taxi directly to 
Revoluci6n or walk there (it takes 
about 10 minutes). Many of the bars 
on Revoluci6n have two-for-one spe-
cials so read the flyers the waiters 
tluust in your face. 

ACcepted at 
more schools 

At many ofthc bars, Wednesday is 
"Ladies Nile" - girls drink for free 
usually from 8-11 p.m. Check with 
individual clubs for their specials. -
Nearly all of these places advertise no 
oover, but thesccurity guards are prone 
to change their minds, depending on 
who is trying to enter. Keep someone 
sober enough to lead you all out of 
"Sodom" and t.dt home. Have fun. 
Party on.

THIS FRIDAY 



HIATUS 6 The UCSD Guudian 1'ueIday, September 19,199S 

Pearl Jam, RE.M. 
. Highlight Fall Concerts 
It was a dismal summer in San Diego for concerts. Most of the major 

package tours (the H.O.R.D.E. tour, Lol/apalooza, the Watped Tour, 
Live/PJ Harvey!Veruca Salt) lskipped over this town. But then again, it 
was a pretty dismal summer for concerts in general Lolillpalooza and 
the Warped Tour didn't live up to their hype, so we didn't really miss 
much. With the exception of Pearl Jam, il currently looks as if many 
major artists are going to bypass San Diego this fall (SoulAsylum and 
PJ Harvey have da~es in L.A., but none in San Diego). Here's a guide 
to the shows already booked, and one can only hope more are added as 
the Fall progresses. 

Wednesday, Sept. 20 
Dfrty'I'hree, the Mercury Tea Co. and the 

Sort or Quartet at the Casbah. Dirty Three. a 
band from Australia, was one of the standout 
acts on the second stage of Lollapalooza. Led by . 
violinist Warren Ellis, the band plays all 
instrumentals, ranging from country 10 punk. 
Ellis' introductions 10 various songs make the 
show worthwhile. He will often ramble on about 
how a song reflects waking up in the morning 10 
realize your life is hell. If you listen really hard, 
you can often hear what he's talking about. 

Saturday, Sept. 23 
BIlak, 7 Secoads, the Blue Meuies and 

Sb8des Apart at SOMA uve. North County's 
Blink is the San Diego version of Green Day. 
The band's songs about male hormones are 

. pretty artific:iaJ, but it mixes pop and punk with 
, such skill on last year's debut cheshire Cat, it's 
a bard act 10 resist. 

Marina South. Guitarists Beck and Santana may 
have done their best work in the '70s when 
flashy guitar gods ruled, but they still have some 
decent chops. 

Wednesday, Sept. 27 
Presideatsortbe Ualted~orAmerka, 

Bag and SUder at SDSU's Back Door. The 
Presidentshaveonealtemativeradiohit, "Lump," 
from their self-titled debut. The Seattle-based 
band incorporates white-trash humor inlo its 
music. nag is a solid funk band and Slider will 
release its debut, Fmnont, on Oct. 10.

PllllbattheFmbuadero Marina Park South. 

Phish is pe!bapI the beat alternative for dis-

Tuesday, Oct. 3 
Gene and Menthol at the Hahn 

Cosmopolitan Theatre. Gene vocalist 
Martin Rossiter is often accused of 
ripping off ~orrissey. Since the re-
lease of Morrissey's new album keeps 
getting postponed, Rossiter is an ad-
equatesubstitutc. The English band's 
debut, Olympian, is huge overseas 
and just starting to gain popularity in 
the United States. Opening act Men-
thol is the latest band to emerge from 
Champaign, IL, the home of Hum. 

TuHday, Oct. 10 
Blind Meloa at SOMA Live. This 

band had a major hit with "No Rain," 
a song from its self-titled album. The 
song's Buffalo Springfield-like har-
mony made it one of 1993's biggest 
hits. The group's follow-up album, 
Soup, has gotten dismal reviews but 
the song "GaIaxie" (this time stealing 
from the Beatles) is getting signifi-
caat alternative radio airplay. 

Fn.y,Oct.20 
8oIalO at SDSU's Open Air 

Amphitheatre. After banging to-
gether for 17 yean, Boingo bids 
farewell with this show. With singer' 
Danny Elfman and guitarist Steve 
Bartek composing film scores, the 
end of Boipgo wu inevitable. The 
show at the Open Air Amphitheatre 
falls close to Halloween, the time of 
Boingo's legendary Southern Cali-
fornia concerts. 

Saturday, Oct. 2. 
R.E.M. and Soak Youth at the

of R.E.M. has undergone summer

rescheduled 000; so it's anyone's 
guess whether this show wiD ac:tuaUy

MOftSterfeatures the kind ofhard rock 
sonp that should do weD in I big 
venue. If you're a fan ofearly R.E.M., 
you might want to sit lbisoae out. The 
band hasn't been playing anytbiDs

By Scott Peden 
Staff Writer 

At UC Davis, the community was built 
around the university, catering to its every want 
and need. The same goes for South Bend, IN, 
and Hannover, NH. And tiny towns like 
Lawrence, Kansas are only on the ~ because 
of jumbo schools like the University of Kansas.

~ to keep Ibis campus a seaet 
To combat this geriatric forte, UCSD stu-

dents do have options for weekend - and even 
weekday - fun. Two of the best places to relax 
are Moondoggies and the La Jolla Brewing Co. 

Nestled in the heartof downtown LaJoUa on 
Prospect Street, Moondoggies is possibly the 

best spons bar in the county. The ujH:1ose 
setting is ideal if you want to sit back and enjoy 
their favorite team on lV, rather than sit a mile 
away from the action, like most sports bars. 

And, of course, Moondoggies' greasy ~ 
tizers are the perfect companions for any sports-
watclUng addict. The already raucous atmo-
sphere increases a few decibels on Thursday 
nights, when the 21-11KH>vercrowd moves in 10 
lap up the drink specials on "UCSD Night· 

For a more relaxing environment, venture 
down the street and make a few turns until you 
hit Fay Avenue and the La Jolla Brewing Co., 
which is right ICIOII from Von's. 

If Moondoggies Iaclcs anything. it is a spe-
cious, mellow atmosphere that lends itself to 
chatting. The La Jolla Brewing Co. offers not 
only a calm atmosphere, but aL<!o some of the 
best beer and sandwicbea in the area. There's 110

North County 
Pizza Port's Brew and Pizza ~ 
. The Destin Solana Beach 

By Tedd Ladd 
Senior Staff Writer 

Think of it like that cool professor who may 
be in his 40s and wears a tweed jacket, but isn 't 
completely out of style. So goes Solana Beach, a 
quiet city by the surf in San Diego'S burgeoning 
North County. It 's a town with sophisticated 
casualness which sets it apart from its snooty 
southern neiglibors. 

Del Mar and La Jolla, areas teeming with the 
ultra-rich and the ultra-stuffy, tend to shy away 
from the college crowd. Solana Beach, however, 
embraces it, offering a wide variety of restaurants 
and hang-outs for the young and old alike. 

One of these places, located right off Old 
Highway 101 near the Lomas Santa Fe intersec-
tion, is Pizza Port. A deceptively smal.! grub and 
grog eatery, Pizza Port could almost be the 
quintessential college joint - if it weren't for the 
families lining its benches on weekends. 

North County residents pack the place, filing 
in so that they can much on Pizza Port's solid 
selection of pizzas. From the Hawaiian-style 
"Pizza Lahaina" (pineapple, bacon and peppers) 
to the seafood-oriented "Pizza Solana" (shrimp. 
clams and mushrooms), the offerings Ire thick, 
greesy and good. 

Appetizers are also delicious. Leading the 
way are the ultra·hot "Spicy Chicken Wings" 
and the bite·sized pieces of Pizza Port 's crust, 
complete with ranch, marinera or cajun dip, 
which are affectionately called "Beer Buddies." 

Which gets us to the most important aspect of 

Pizza Port's repartee: beer. They brew it on the 
premises, and the variety - always unique and 
occasionally cheap in price - changes daily. 

Pizza Port's brews are renowned across San 
Diego, and are even sold in Porter's Pub on the 
UCSD campus. The lighter, honey varieties usu· 
ally have enough flavor to knock your socks off, 
which is all a college student could ask for. 
Restaurants 

The Ocean Grill, 1231 Camino Del Mar in 
downtown Del Mar - With low to medium 
prices and Greek-style seafood and sandwiches, 
this low-key establishment has received raves 
from several food critics. A good place to take out 
food to the beach. Very little seating inside. 

Java Depot, u.s. Highway 101 across from 
the Solona Beach train station - A trendy coffee 
shop, frequented by Keanu Reeves on occasion. 
Java Depot has a good atmosphere for studying 
and chatting, but grab the tiled table early - it's 
the most comfortable. Also, it has an adjoining 
juice bar. 
Places to CO 

Del Mar Plaza, Camino Del Mar and 15th 
street in downtown Del Mar - The plaza area 
has some high-brow shops that are fun to browse, 
as well as several moderate to expensive restau-
rants. It's worth the price, however - most of 
them have an ocean view. 

BaUoon Rides and '!be Racetrack - The 
Del Mar track sports year-round festivities, and 
there are several deals to hitch a ride with those 
multi-<Xllored balloons that dot the Del Mar sky.

• Heidi Up In Smoke: A cigar afflCanado takes a puff of a factory favorite. 

ByJefJN ..... 
Hiatus Editor 

According to an editorial by 
Marvin R. Shanken in the summer 
1995 issue of Cigar Aficionado, con-
sumptionofcigarsintheUnitedStates 
i'I steadily increasing. Last year, cigar 
consumption increased 27 percent, 
and !his year, cigar consumption is 
reportedly up 50 percent Shanken, 
the editor of Cigar Aficionodo, at-
tributes the increase to the promotion 
provided by his magazine, which first 
hit stands in September of 1992. 

But cigars have recently received 
a wider cullural" exposure. Wayne 
Wang's movie SmoIu! documents the 
goings..on at a smoke shop in New 
York, giving smoking the status of 
high art. Actors such as Jack 
Nicholson, Bill Cosby and, of course, 
George BUIm are avid cigar smokers. 
Rush Limbaugh, President Bill 
Qinton and Justice Clarence Thomas 
also smoke cigars (not that they have 

SUS SIIIliE 

any credibility), and a number of 
women (such as Madonna) have also 
taken up the habit. 

Given the popularity of cigars, it 
only makes sense that 1be Cuban 
OgarFactory,locatedintheGaslamp 
District in downtown San Diego, 
would be a success. Don'l let the 
name fool you - the cigars al The 
Cuban Cigar Factory are not really 
from Cuba. Because of liong-stand-
ing U.S. embargo, Cuban cigars can't 
be bought in the U.S. If you want one, 
you'lI have to head into Mexico or 
find someone who has smuggled them 
into the country. 

Instead, the cigars at The Cuban 
Cigar Factory are filJed with tobaa:o 
leaves from the Dominican Republic, 
Honduras and Mexico. Rolled in the 
store, the cigars are perhaps the fresh-
est you'lI find anywhere in San Di-
ego. 11Iey'U cost you too - most 
retail for three or four dollars a piece.

a cover. Girls have nothing to wony 
about Two levels, several dance floors 
and some pool tables in the back.

The UCSD Guardian 

Steady Stan: Quarter-
back Stan Humphries 
riddled the Seattle de-
fense with big throws 
when it counted, hurl-
ing two touchdown 
passes (left). 

Tuesday, September 19, 1995 

hen Ronnie Harmon trotted into the 
endzone with the game-winning catch 
against the Seattle Seahawks in last 
weekend's home opener, the Charger 
faithful breathed a deep sigh of relief. 

A Week One loss at the hands of the resurgent 
Raiders left t.he defending AFC champions in a 
must-win situation against Seattle, and the notori-
ously hapless Hawks were threatening to make 
nightmares come true all across Charger-land, 
leading, 10-7, in the fourth quarter. 

However, with 13:41 remaining in the game, 
Stan Humphries teamed with Harmon to save the 
day. The Chargers' offense set up camp on the 
Seattle IS-yard line after a 100play, 65-yard drive 
which left the crowd hoping tbat penalties and 
turnovers would not strike-down yet another San 
Diego opportunity. 

This time, the Chargers did not disappoint; 
Humphries dropped back into the pocket and lofted 
a picture-perfect pass toward the front left comer 
of the endzone. 

Harmon, who broke upfield behind cornerback 
Corey Harris after the ball was thrown, was the 
beneficiary of the lofty throw, and he cradled the 
ball for the eventual game-winner, 14-10. 

For more Char~ers ()overage, see page 817

Tuesday, September 19, 1995 

Natrone bomb: San 
Diego all-pro running 
back Natrone Means 
regained his winning 
form against the 
Seahawks, rushing 
for over 100 yards 
(right). 

Speed demon: 
Ronnie Harmon 
reeled in the game-
winning touchdown 
for the Chargers, a 
15-yard grab which 
lifted his team in the 
fourth quarter (lower 
right). 

CODtilied (rom page 816 
After the game, Harmon downplayed the 

big catch saying, "It was a good throw and I 
caught it." His lack of enthusiasm may be 
due, in part, to his dissatisfaction with bis role 
in the offense. Luckily for the Chargers, other 
players were more excited with the come-
from-behind win. 

"It's always Ronnie who comes to the 
rescue," receiver Tony Martin said aft~rwards. 
"He' s a phenomenal back." 

Martin did some rescuing of his own for 
the Chargers, tallying a career-high 13 catches ' 
for 163 yards - includ ' ng the opening score 
of the game. The touch own came on a nifty, 
five-yardjaunt into "tbe zone" on San Diego's 
first drive: a powerful, 75-yard march. 

Natrone Means spearheaded the scoring 
effort taking six carries for 31 yards. With 
Martin reeling in a 21-yard catch at the 
Seahawk five-yard-line, the Chargers were 
w~ll on their way to tbeir first touchdown. 

Seattle retaliated in the second quarter, 
when quarterback Rick Mirer bit rookie tight 
end Christian Fauria on a 20-yard score, knot-
ting the contest at 7-7. 

The Seahawks grabbed the lead wben 
kicker Tom Peterson capped an ll-play, 57-
yard drive with a 23-yard field goal. The Icicle 
was a moral victory for the Chargers. What 
had appeared to be a touchdown two plays 
earlier - when Mirer ran eight yards and 
extended tbe ball across the goal line - was 
ruled a non-score. 

The referees indicated that Mirerwas down 
before the ball crossed tbe plane of the goal 
line. The Chargers defense rose to the occa-
sion on third down, stuffing running back 
Chris Warren for no gain and forcing the 
Seahawks to settle for three. 

In a game the Chargers should have had 
well under, control, tbe 10-7 lead was more 
than Seattle deserved. 

San Diego's offensive numbers - 251 
yards passing and 146 rushing - appear to be 
those of a successful afternoon on the grid-
iron. Unfortunately for the Chargers, a num-
ber of scoring chances were lost because of 
turnovers and untimely penalties. 

"We bad a Chance to explode in the first 
half and we didn't do it," linebacker Ju~or

"This year, we have 17 athletes

said. "We're a young team, mainly 
sophomore oriented." 

Smith has been the Tritons' top 
runner the past three weeks, and she 
proved herself worthy of this status 
with a 29th-place finish in the Invi-
tational and a second-place finish in 
the open phase of the Invite.

"Gray was our female Triton-

said. "To improve that much is 
significant and it was a magnifi-

we have a very young team, and 
we're going to need a huge im-
provement to reach NCAA Na-

we can do it. "

Tritons Bounce Back I. YOU WAIII' YO • A IN ... " ,. __ I PAGE SHARP WHIT: UCSD down~ Whittier, 2-1, to raise its record to 3-2 
aySNnR .... ml 
Associate Sports Editor 

In what promises to be an up-
and-down season, the UCSD men's 
SO(;CU team (3-2) took a turn for the 

better when it de-
feated Whittier Col· 
lege by a score of2-
I, ending a two-
game skid. 

Playing on the 
road for the fourth 
consecutive game, 
the Tritons hung 

tough against the Poets. Nate 
Hetherington notched his first goal 
of the season to put the Tritons on 
the board, and Jacob Bollinger'S 
second strike ofthe year was the nail 
in the coffin. Joel Kossakoff was a 
key to UCSD's offensive efforts as 
he assisted on both scoring efforts. 

Mter starting the season with 
impressive wins over UC Santa Cruz 
(5-1) and Occidental (3-0), Coach 
Derek Armstrong's guys were on 
the losing end in back-to-back road 
games. The Warriors of Westmont 
College downed the Tritons, 4-1, 
and Azusa Pacific delivered a sec-
ond-straight drubbing to the UCSD 
squad, this time by a 5-1 score. 

"We're stumbling a little bit right 
now,- Armstrong said. "We started 
with 'two wins, but then we lost two 
in a row. This next spell that we are 
on is a tough one. We have been on 
the road for quite a stretch, and it's 
going to be important to <Xlme out of 
it playing well. II 

A big part of the Tri-
tons' problem has been 
the rough start of fresh-
man gOlllie Jason 
Reynoso. He started out 
well,givinguponlyone 
goal to UC Santa Cruz 
in the first game and 
followed that ilp with a 
shutout of Occidental 
on Sept. 6. 

However, in his next 
two games, Reynoso 
gave up four and five 
goals, respectively. Go-
ing into Saturday'S 
game versus the Poets, . 
he had a bloated 2.5 
goals-against average. 

Improved play from 
Reynoso will be a key YIIIt.av ZOIoIOfeV/Guant/an 
to the Triton hopes the Hlib lCorer: Erik Waldman has 3 goals. 
rest of the season, be-
cause while a solid keeper can carry 
a team, no defense can help a keeper 
wbo is not on his game. 

"He's had a bad start, but we've 
talked about it and it's out in the 
open, II Annstrongsaid. "He's work-
ing on getting better and he knows 
he has got to get fit. He's a fresh-
man, so he is going to need some 
time. But we know he'll get there. II 

The Tritons offense has been led 
by the play of Eric Waldman (three 
goals, one assist) and Jay New<Xl1nCI' 
(four assists) in the early going this 
season. 

"At the moment, [Waldman) re-
alizes he is a senior and he wants to 

produce in his last year," Armstrong · 
said. "He ·is frustrated, but that is 
because he wants to win. II 

The next game for the men's 
soccer team is this Wednesday at 
Southern California College. sec 
is always a tough opponent and will 
be a test for the road·weary Tritons. 

"It's a night game at sec and 
they have a lot of people show up, II 
Armstrong said. "It is going to be 
tough.-

If UCSD can escape with a vic-
tory, they will be able to return for 
their first home game of the season 
against Biola on Friday, with a reo 
spectable 4-2 mark.

surprised by the virtual cornucopia 
of free food available to the hard-
workingjoumalists. These upwardly 
mobile writers used various meth-
ods to bum off the calories from all 
the available food groups, ranging 
from the ever popular "stand-and-
stretch" to the oft-used "removed-
shoe-foot-scratch. " 

Another journalistic perk was the 
pages of statistics which innundated 
each press box seat shortly after the 
conclusion of every quarter. The 
sports-information machine of a pro-
fessional team can tum out enough 
numbers, averages, totals and 
rankings to confuse even the most 
mathematical of intellects. 

Because I am not one of the few, 
the proud, the math geeks, I was all 
the more baffled by the plethora of 
papers before me. And, after ana-
lyzing the materials for seven days, 
I think it is quite possible that we 
may never know how they get that 
damned cream filling in there. 

Another crucial aspect of foot-
ball reporting is safely reaching the 
fieldatthetwo-minutewarning. The 
swarm of journalists heading for the 
elevator (down to the field) is a 
horrid spectacle which closely re-
sembles the running of the bulls in 
Pamplona, Spain each year. 

And I played the part of the help-
Ie5&. foreigner stumbling into the 
middle of the street to reason with 
theonrushing bulls. Needless to say, 
I was gored. 

In retrospect, however, the expe-
riena of covering a professional 
sporting event is one which I hope to 
repeat in the near future. But with 
these rules in mind: 1) Leave really 
early, 2) bring walking shoes and 3) 
in reference to the post-game inler-
views, run like hell.

"Castner cranked up the kitchen 
oven and was racing at a whole new 
level," Van Arsdale said. 

Castner's third-place time of 
25:17 was a 47 second improve-
ment over last year and Walsh's 
12th-place mark of 25:44 eclipsed 
his previous time by a minule and 
seven seconds. 

"(Walsh] was a stud," Van 
Arsdale said. "He had the eye of a 
hurricane. He was determined, and 
determination is most important 
to a distance runner's success. He 
was our male-Triton-of-the-
week." 

Others who showed improve-
mentwere Robert Ho, jumping from 
the number-eight runner to fourth, 
and Rhodes Walton, who shaved 
off over two minutes from his pre-
vious Invite time. 

"What (Walton] did was spec-
tacular," Van Arsdalesaid. "It is not 
everyday that you can cut two min-

. utes from your time. 
'" honestly believe we have the 

best chemistry this year of any year 
that I'vecoached.lcan 't say enough 
about the job that captain Nate 
Johnson hu done. I couldn't see 
anyone do it better," Van Andale 
added. 

Next week, the Tritons travel to 
UC Rivenlde, to battle Division III 
rivala in hopei of continuing their 
momentum.

Top-Ranked· UCSD Hit by Injuries 
ROCKY ROAD: The UCSD women's volleyball team ~gan the year ranked number one, but fell after injuries beset the team 
By D.,. KnIft 
Sports Editor 

A traditionally powerful team, 
the ucsa women's volley squad 
has not been accustomed to any-

thing le.55 than success, 
even against opponents 
from Division I or II 
schools. 

However, the be-
ginning of this season 
has been a rocky one 
for the Tritons. Inju-
ries, lineup changes 

and other setbacks have hampered 
UCSD's game·time performances 
and resulted in a lackluster 2-5 
record. 

Although four of the Tritons' 
five defeats have come at the hands 
of ranked opponents from the NAIA 
and Division II, UCSD has struggled 
trying to find its game. 

The Tritons' most recent outings 
were a perfect example of their 
plight. In a road trip north to face 
NAIA foe Azusa Pacific and Divi-
sion " rival Cal State University 
San Bernardino, UCSD came away 
empty-handed, suffering back-to-
back defeats. 

The Tritons early season perfor-
mance has caused the NCAA to 
drop them from the number-one 
Division III ranking to number-two. 

"We're not ready yet to play al 
that level," Head Volleyball Coach 
Doug Dannevik said. "Injuries and 
getting used to new positions have 

hurt us. We haven't had the same 
starting lineup for two games in-a-
row all season long." 

The loss to Azusa Pacific on 
Thursday evening was an especially 
hard one to swallow. Ranked ninth 

in the NAlA, Pacific wu a stiff 
challenge. However, the Triton 
squad came onto the court hot, cap-
turing the opening game by a 15-8 
tally. 

Mter cooling off enough to drop 

Banled Up: Christine Chi (lower left) is one of the injured Tritons 
Coach Dannevik is counting on having in the lineup this season. 

game two, 15-7, the Tritons once 
again gained the upper hand, win-
ning the third game, 15-9, and tak-
i ng a 2-1 lead in the contest. 

UCSD surrendered the fourth 
game, 15-7, and then relinquished a 
9-1 advantage in the fifth and final 
game of the match ,which was being 
played under rally scoring. Azusa 
prevailed by a 15-13 score in game 
five to win the match, 3-2. 

"We made some critical errors in 
that fifth game that really cost us," 

15-11) and Northweat Nazarene 
College (15-13, 15-10, 12-15, 15-
9). UCSD's defeats were at the hands 
of Biola, Point Lorna and Lee Col-
lege (fN). Both PI. Loma and Biola 
are ranked in the top 10 in NAIA. 

Currently, the Tritons are 
banged up where it counts. Their 
three returning all-Americans, 
Christine Chi (knee), Angelle Cro-
chet (quad, knees) and Madelyn 
Ripken, have been unable to prac-
tice together so far because of their 

Dannevik said,

various ailments. 
In addition, 

sive attack was led 
by senior outside 
hitter Angelle Cro· 
chet, who 
slammed 23 kills 
and hit _324 -

while picking up CSUSB 15 15 15 
20 digs. It was the 
first time this season that a Triton UCSD. 
outside hitter had managed an aver· 
age of over .200. 

But, in a scenario that has be-
come all too familiar for the Tritons, 
her efforts left her battered, bruised, 
and unavailable for UCSD's show-
down with San Bernardino on Fri· 
day. 

The Coyotes, ranked 16th in Di-
vision II, took advantage of the 
hobbled Triton leam, sweeping them 
by scores of 15-9, 15-9 and 15-7. 

Over the summer break, the Tri-
tons' victories came against Bethel 
College (15-11, 15-12, 10-15 and 

"We may not have our full team 
until the third week in October," 
Dannevik said. "We are very ath-
letic and I think we will be very 
good, but right now we are just 
going to have to take this thing 
week by week and see how we 
do." 

The Tritons will continue their 
tough schedule tomorrow night 
when they play Division II rival UC 
Riverside in RIMAC at7 p.m. It will 
be the first match ever for the 
women's volleyball team in the new 

'athletic facility.

Adventures in

my first experience as a writer 
at a professional sporting event 
is something I've been looking 
forward to since the day after I 
stopped teething.

came to me in the form of a 
press pass to see the defend-
ing-AFC Champion San Diego 
Chargers take on the Seattle 
Seahawks, I was - to say the 
least - elated. 

I always assumed, like the 
optimist I am, that my first 
"professional" experience 
would have involved a 
somewhat less legitimate sport, 
such as roller hockey or the 
highly esteemed WWF. 

But the San Diego Charg-
ers?! Never had my mind 
allowed a thought so positive 
to grace its admittedly barren 
landscape. 

On the morning of the big 
game, I awoke at the crack of 
dawn to begin my prepara-
tions. (Shortly thereafter, I fell 
back into bed and promptly 
overslept. ) 

My second attempt to bring 
myself to full consciousness 
was more successful, and soon 
I met up with my photographer 
at the office. In my infinite, 
journalistic wisdom, I . 

PERFECT START: The UCSD women's 
soccer team beat SFSU to go 5-0 on the year 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

The women's soccer team is 
the closest thing UCSD has to an 
athletic dynasty. The team's per-
fect 5-0 start this year has raised its 
regular season unbeaten streak to 
40 games - a record which dates 
back to October 9, 1992, and has 
gone unhindered by .teams from 
Division I, II and III, as well as the 
NAIA. 

The Tritons notched 
their fifth victory of the 
season by downing Divi-
sion II foe San Francisco 
State 4-0 last Saturday 
night. It was the first game 
ever under the lights at 
Triton soccer stadium. 

The game was score-
less midway through the 
first half, when senior for-
ward Carin Pugh was fouled 
while racing down the right sideof 
the field. The penalty resulted in 
a free kick for the Tritons. 

ing style of play was all the 
defense they needed. In the first 
half, San Francisco did not of-
fer a single shot to challenge 
Triton freshman goalie Amanda 
Arban. 

Arban faced only one shot 
in the game and stopped it, re-
cording her third shutout of the 
season. 

"Last year this team gave us 
a lot of trouble because the field 

[in San Francisco] has 
long grass and is very 
boggy," UCSD 
Women's Head Coach 
Brian McManus said. 
"We play a speed 
game. We get the ball 
and outrun people. I'd 
take us against any-
body on our home 
field." 

The second half was more 
of the same for the Tritons, as 
the speed merchants from La 
Jolla continued to run circles 
around their bay-area oppo-
hents.

asssumed that an hour and a 
half would be plenty of time to 
reach the stadium - which is, 
alterall, a mere IS minutes 

Sophomore midfielder Lauren 
Johnson took the kick and 
launched it over the wall of op-
posing players and into the crowd ' 
in front of the Gator netminder. 
UCSD's Diana Muchowski took 
it from there, out-jumping every-
one on the field to score a header 
at 21 :31 on the clock. 

Pugh made her presence felt 
again early on in tbe seoond 
half, when she broke free at the 
midfield stripe with only one 
defender between her and tbe goal.

away. . 
After an uneventful drive to 

"the Murph," everything 
seemed to be on schedule. 
However, as we pulled off the 
IS and onto Friar's Road, we 
found ourselves in a traffic jam 
reminiscent of Los Angeles, at 
rush hour, minutes after "the 
big one." 

In the subsequent 90 
minutes that it took us to inch 
past the sta~ium, helplessly 
staring at the "parking lot full" 
signs we drove beneath, many 
thoughts occurred to me - not 
the least of which was: How 
do they get the cream filling in 
the middle of a twinkie? 

Two hours after exiting the 
freeway, and halfway into the 
second quarter, we finally 
managed to make a U-turn. We 
then begged our way into one 
of the parking lots by claiming 
to be highly touted journalists, 
who just happened to be 
unaware of the traffic at such 
an event. 

The Tritons wasted little time 
extending their lead to 2-0. Yet 
another free kick by Johnson was 
volleyed into the goal, this time by 
senior midfielder Kelly Kramer at 
29:16 into the half. 

The Tritons' fast-paced attack-

Pugh dribbled in on the left 
side and drew out the lone de-
fender before dishing the ball 
to a streaking Ele Johnson on 
the right side. 

Johnson marched in towards 
the goal and punched a shot in, 
before being tackled by the div-
ing San Francisco goalie, Karen 

Meagher. That score made it 3-0, 
UCSD, with 47:17 elapsed in the 
game. 

The Tritons rounded out the Scor-
ing minutes later when an Ele Johnson 
shot once again found the back of the 
net. Her namesake, 
Lauren Johnson, was 

versity of St. Thomas, 4-0, and 
earned a key victory over Macalester 
College, 3-1. 

UCSD's offensive spark, was pro-
,vided by Pugh (two goals and 'four 
assists) and EleJohnson(threegoals 

and one assist). 
"Those were big 

responsible for the 
nicely struck corner 
kick, which Ele put 
past Meagher for a 
commanding 4-0 
UCSD lead.
