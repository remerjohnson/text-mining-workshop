Facing low revenue, Sweeten 
proposes more USSA funding 

By PATRICK ALLEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

De pite an expected bud-
get shortfall in the ten of thou-
ands of dollars, A.S. President 

Christopher weeten has proposed 
increa ed payment for member-
ship dues to the University of 
California tudent A~sociation 
and the United States Student 
Association as part of his most 
recent 2005-06 budget proposal. 

In recent years, UCSD has paid 
US SA - the only student asso-
ciation recognized by Congress and 
the White House - five cents 
per student per quarter rather than 
the approximately $I-per-student 
per-quarter payment that is now 
required for membership. 

In his preliminary budget pro-
posal, Sweeten recommended that 
the council allocate $10,000, or 
approximately 50 cents per stu-
dent, to USSA next year in order 
to make progress toward full 
membership. 

"We haven't been paying them 
what we were supposed to be pay-
ing them," Sweeten said. "We 
therefore do not get full participa-

tion in the association." 
The dramatic increase in 

dues is due to a recent change 
in the organization's fee system. 
According to USSA Organizing 
Director and former A.S. President 
Jenn Brown, a court ruling forced 
USSA to begin to charge universi-
ties based on their populations, 
rather than campus allocations. 
The change resulted in a large fee 
increase for UCSD, but the cam-
pus will have several years to meet 
the new fee requirement. 

"Since it is a significant increase 
on some campuses, we realize that 
it might take a few years [before 
schools can pay the full amount]," 
Brown said. "UCSD will sti ll be 
able to vote if they pay fifty cents 
per student, as long as it is passed 
with the understanding that it is a 
step to full payment." 

In addition , UCSA has 
increased its quarterly recom-
mended membership fees from $1 
to $1.20 per student for next year, 
though $1 is sti ll the minimum for 
campuses. 

This school yea r, the .S. 
Council spent a total of $22 ,425 
on membership in the lobbying 

groups. The proposed hike would 
bring the grand total to $34,000, 
with the majority of the increases 
earmarked for USSA. 

According to Sweeten, full 
membership in USSA would allow 
UCSD to receive services, such 
as the Grass-Roots Organizing 
Weekend and the Electoral Action 
Training, free of charge. The 2005 
G.R.O.w. event held at UCSD 
cost the council $3,000 and the 
E.A.T. program was originally 
allocated almost $2,000 before the 
item wa cut from the current 
budget. 

The increase has proved con-
troversial in the initial budget dis-
cussions among councilrnembers. 
Thurgood MarshaU College Senior 

enator Kate Pillon said that she did 
not support the full. boost because 
USSA does not impact students as 
much as UCSA does. 

"USSA is far away, and U SA 
affects students," Pillon said. " In 
a budget crisis like the one we are 
in, ] would rather see us throwing 
our support behind UCSA fully."

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
has announced that the university 
will appoint visual arts professor

College provost. Smith will offi-
cially take office starting in July. 

"Professor Smith's academic

Ludacris set to headline 
23rd annual Sun God festival 
Popular Atlanta rapper rose to the top of 

hip-hop with long string of hit singles 
By ADAM STALEY 

Staff Writer 

Since the explosion of the 
Dirty South after 2000, many 
rappers that lack what we crit-
ics call "talent" have emerged. 
Fortunately, this yea r's head-
liner at the Sun God festival, 
Ludacris, does not find himself 
on this extensive list. Although 
many may lump Ludacris into 
the nondescript genre of main-
stream rap, Luda tends to break 
the mold more often than con-
fornllilgj ju~'t ask Bill O'Reilly, 
who engaged in a verbal spar-
ring match with the rapper that 
resulted in the loss of LlIda 's 
Pepsi endorsement. 

Ludacris truly earned his way 
into the game, justifying his claim 
as a "self-made millionaire" on 
The Red Light District's "Child 
of the Night." Starting off as a 
radio-show OJ in Adanta, Luda 
paid his dues and eventually 
released his independent debut, 
incognegro, in 2000. The albunl 
was a huge success in Adanta, 
and when the sexually explicit 

"What~ Your Fantasy?" began 
picking up steam as a regional 
hit, Scarface, who had just begun 
as a talent scour for Def Jam 
South, selected Ludacris a his 
first signing. 

Bock for the First T/lIIe was 
Ludacris' fi rst release llllder Def 
Jam, and the album made quite 
a splash with hits like "What's 
Your Fantasy?," "Southern 
] lospitali ty" - which tallght 
those not in the know how it' 
done in the SOUdl ("Cadillac 
grill s, y'a ll '~ - and "Phat 
Rabbit," one of Luda's first 
tracks, which was initially fea-
tured on Til11baland' 1998 
release, Bio. 

The out tanding success 
of the album, coupled with 
mainstream America's accep-
tance of the in-y.our- face 
style of Southern rap, led to 
Luda 's second major- label 
release, Word of Mouf This 
album was anchored by the 
strength of its singles. "Rollout

Muir: Interim provost to

CuI provOSts," Smith said . "It's 
exciting and it's also a tremendous 
responsibility, and if I can do a 
tenth as much as they did, I will 
be' very ha ppy. " 

Smith said that she does not 
have a set agenda going into her 
position and will try to maintain 
the spirit of the Muir College 
community. 

"What I would like to do is 
spend a lot of time my first year 
listening to what Muir students 
and staff feel are the strong points 
of [the college] that they would 
like to see continued, and also 
whatever issues they feel need to 
be addressed," Smith said . 

However, Smith said she does 
have certain goals in mind, incl ud-
ing the improvement of student-
faculty relations. 

"I'd really like to try to look at 
di fferent ways to get more facul ty 
involved with students, but also 
on the other side of the coin, 
to make students aware that the 
faculty are really there for them," 
she said. 

Smith studied history, phi-
losophy and psychology as an 
undergraduate at Swarthmore 
College in Pennsylvania, where 
the small and close-knit commu-
nity of the university struck her. 
While pursuing graduate studies 
in art history at the University 
of Pennsylvania, she worked in 
the admissions office, where she 
gained administrative experience. 

''It was really an experience 
that I think a lot of graduate 
students don't have of seei ng the 
administrative side of the univer-
sity, and I found it very interest-
ing," Smi th said. "I actually said 
to myself when I was in graduate 

school back then that I thought I 
would eventually like to combine 
administration and teaching, and 
it just sort of happened." 

According to Muir College 
Student Council Chair Neil 
Spears, who was involved in the 
selection of the new provost, the 
search committee considered a 
diverse range of candidates. 

"As a student repfesentative 
[on the -committee), I looked 
for someone who was genuinely 
interested in students and in stu-
dent life, and who had an appre-
ciation for the unique community 
of the college," Spears said. "I 
think Susan Smith embodies both 
of these [qualities), and will do a 
fabulous job." 

Current interim Muir provost 
Susan Kirkpatrick was not a can-
didate in the appointment process 
because she plans to retire at 
the end of this academic quarter. 
Kirkpatrick has been serving as 
interim provost for almost two 
years. 

"I think [Smith is) a really 
good match for the college," 
Kirkpatrick said. "She's student-
centered, and her educational 
philosophy fits Muir College in 
terms of the flexibility of require-
ments and promoting the intel-
lect of students. I'm really very 
pleased with this appointment." 

Smith is currently finishing 
a book on the topic of medieval 
women as viewers of art. She also 
plans to begin research on the 
history of photography and the 
snapshot camera, and hopes to 
continue that research when she 
becomes provost .

A.S. Meeting f2. - May 11 

Public Input 
Sheryl Diaz, the vice president 

external of Kaibigang Pilipino, 
asked the council to approve ' a 
resolution in support of a state 
Assembly bill that would require 
teachers of Pilipino language 
classes to undergo accreditation in 
order to ensure that the programs 
are staffed by qualified instructors. 

Special Presentations 
A.S. President Christopher 

Sweeten presented the second 
draft of his 2005-06 executive 
budget to the council. The new 
version includes a $5,000 decrease 
of the previous allocation proposal 
for dues paid to the United States 
Student Association as well as a 
decrease in the amount of money 
intended for college councils. 

The freed funds were ear-
marked for the A.S. Safe Rides 
program. In addition, the new 
proposal will allow college coun-
cils to Apply for A.S. funding 
through the same process used by 
registered student organizations.

Vice President Enelnal Kevin 
Mann 

Mann reported that A.S. Vice 
President of Academic Affairs 
Harry Khanna is one of the final 
three candidates for the student 
regent position. 

Each year, one student from 
the UC system is chosen to sit on 
the Board of Regents as a nonvot-
ing regent-designate for one year, 
followed by one year as a Cull vot-
ing regent. 

Old Business 
ItemB 

The council tabled a resolu-
tion opposing a state Assembly 
bill that would limit the level of 
UC fee increases to 2 percent 
per year unless the University 
of California invests one-third of 
the student fees back into finan-
cial aid . 

According to the resolution, 
the biII would not limit increases 
in student fees if the university 
met the necessary levels of stu-
dent aid or guarantee aid if the 
fees were increased by less than 2 
percent. The council will discuss 
the legislation for one week and 
hold a vote at its next meeting. 

ItemC 
The council passed a resolu-

tion opposing a state Assembly 
bill that would impose harsher 
penalties for students at public 
universities who were convicted 
or pled guilty to a number of 
offenses, including rioting, incit-
ing a riot, remaining present at 
the scene of a riot or assembly 
for the purposes of disturbing 
the peace. 

Students affected by the policy 
would be immediately dismissed 
from the university, prevented 
from reapplying for one year and 
would be ineligible for Cal Grants 
for two years. 

ItemL 
The council rejected an alloca-

tion of $750 for the purchase of 
a computer for the A.S. Senate 
office. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Junior Senator Jason Hoskins said 
he felt the money would be better 
spent on providing services to 
students .

I BRIEFLY 
UC re~laces Los 

Alamos lab diredor 
Late last week, the University of 

Califomia announced the appointÂ· 
ment of a new director to manage 
its much-beleaguered Los Alamos 
National Laboratory. With approval of 
the u.s. Department of Energy, which 
operates the universityÂ·managed lab, 
the UC Board of Regents approved 
nudear weapons expert and former 
National Security Administration offi-
cial Robert W. Kuckuck. as its tempo-
rary head. 

Kuck.uck will take over as interim 
director on May 16, repladng out-
going director George Peter Nanos, 
Whose two-year stint at the lab faced 
many criticisms and propelled the lab 
into national headlines, over several 
security lapses and safety accidents. 

The incidents ignited questions 
over the lab's management The 
Energy Department chose to use a 
competitive bidding process to select 
its next manager instead of renewinB 
the UC mana~ing agreement as It 
had done for SIX decades. 

In the wake of a recent secu-
rity breech, which completely shut 
down the lab's operations, Nanos told 
the regents that the lab's leadership 
would harshly punish employees who 
could not keep dassified' information 
secret. Lab employees criticized his 
comments and started an anony-
mous blogging Web site disparaging 
the management The relations only 
worsened When the lab admitted that 
the dassified computer disks suspect-
ed of being missing never existed. 

The university has also signaled 
that it could make other major leader-
ship changes at the lab in prepara-
tion for a bid for its contract in the 
summer. 

Service workers Yote 
to ratify new contrad 

University of califomia service 
workers, votmg by an overwhelming 
margin, agreed to the university's 
contract offer, ending months of labor 
dispute that resuked in a one-day 
strike and threatened even larger 
wolk stoppages. 

In voting at the end of last week, 
87 percent of union members gave 
their nod to the deal, which estab-
lishes a new minimum wage for food 
service workers and back wages, in 
addition to ocher benefits. The deal 
stopped short of union demands 
for a guaranteed system of wage 
increases that would have dismantled 
the university's current merit-bMed 
approach to promotions, 

The union Â· called the contract 0 a 
huge victory" for workers, which repre-

â¢â¢â¢

San Di.o loses stem 
cell institute bid 

Bya 16-11 vote, the Independent 
Citizens' Oversight Committee 
of the new Califomia Institute of 
Regenerative Medicines voted last 
week to headquarter the state's new 
stem cell foundation in San Francisco. 
San Diego, alon~ with Sacramento, 
had been conSidered in the top 
running for the new institute, cre-
ated by voters last Novem~r through 
Proposition 71. 

Using a special point-based evalu-
ation process, the board's subcommit-
tee had recommended San Francisco 
as the top pick. after making site visits 
to the top three locations. 

'This has been a remarkable pro-
cess, and we thank all of the cities and 
their citizens that generously offered 
their facilities and resources,Â· stated 
Robert Klein, chair of the Independent 
Citizens' Oversight Committee and 
the man who bankrolled a major por-
tion of the S3 billion voter initiative. 
'With the selection of ClRM's perma-
nent headquarters, the institute can

will of the California voters by funding

In competition for the headquar-
ters, which were widely seen as a 
prize that would provide great benefits 
for the victor and establiSh the state's 
top biotechnology market the cities 
submitted competitive bids, offering 
free prime real estate and other ame-
nities. San Diego had offered thou-
sands of feet of office space located 
just north of UCSD. 

CSU paduate student 
employees to strike 
More than 6,000 graduate student 

employees at all 23 california State 
University campuses organized by 
the United Auto WO!kers union have

their jobs on May 12, caUing the WOIk 
stoppage a response to unfair labor 
practices committed by the university.

THURSDAY. MAY 12. 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Plan would mandate UC retum--to--aid 
A. S. Council passes resolution opposing bill 

By SHANNON EUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

The University of California 
would have to spend at least one-
third of new student fees on finan-
cial aid if tuition costs are raised 
more than 2 percent per year, 
under a new proposal under review 
by state lawmakers. Sponsored 
by Rep. Rudy Bermudez (D-
Norwalk), the bill is being heard 
before the state Assembly and is 
intended to keep education afford-
able for Californians, particularly 
for low-income students dependent 
on financial aid. 

In the current year, UC cam-
puses have directed 20 percent of 
revenue resulting from the student 
fee increase approved by the UC 
Board of Regents last year to stu-
dent financial-aid programs. For 
2005-06, the regents have approved 
spending 25 percent of new fees 
on financial aid. The return-to-aid 
ratio is approximately the same at 
California State University. 

"With almost 30 percent of 
Californias families having incomes 
below 200 percent of the fed-
eral poverty level, tuition increases 
have closed the doors of access to 
Californias working-class students," 
Bennudez stated in a press release. 
"fr is our responsibility to keep the 
quality affordable and accessible by 
providing a university education for 
all qualified students." 

Janet Luna, a legislative aid to 
Bermudez, said that the bill was 
written in the interests of students. 

"This is a student-protection 
bill," Luna said. "It was designed 
to ensure students who are in need 
maintain their access ro higher 
education. " 

Annual decisions regarding 
mandatory student fees are gener-
ally based on the availability of state 
funds. In good fiscal years, student 
fees remain constant or decrease, 
while they generally increase dur-
ing years when the state is facing 
a deficit. 

" [T]uition increases have 
closed the doors of access 
to California's working, 

class students." 
- Rep. Rudy Bermudez (D-

Nor'-"'\ 1..., 
"Students who attend col-

lege in good fiscal times pay less 
than those students who attend in 
bad fiscal times," the Legislative 
Analysts' Office stated in its annual 
budget report. 

Critics of the bill have said 
that the proposed 2-percent cap 
on annual student-fee increases is 
lower than the cap approved by 
the universities and Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger in their budget 
compact. The compact allows 
undergraduate student fees at UC 
and CSU campuses to increase by 

8 percent over the next two years. 
For the subsequent years, it pro-
poses to link fee hikes ro increases 
in California's per-capita personal 
income. Opponents also argue 
that the most significant barrier to 
expanding access for low-income 
students is inadequate funding for 
state institutions, maintaining that 
it is the job of state and federal 
governments - not the university 
- to provide aid. 

Rep. Shirley Horton (R-Lemon 
Grove) was one of three legislators 
to vote against the bill in commit-
tee. 

"[Horton) doesn't believe 
California can handle these issues 
fiscally right now," sajd Brent 
Young, Horton's aid. "[The propos-
al) also goes against the previously 
established governor's compact, 
which set the cap of fee increases at 
10 percent." 

Horton offered a similar bill 
two years ago, but with a cap of 10 
percent, instead of the 2-percent 
ceiling in the Bermudez. bill. 

"California schools are going 
through a ton of problems and the 
number has to be a little bit high-
er," Young said. "[Horton) would 
vote for it if the percentage were 
slightly increased, but definitely 
nothing below 6 percent." 

Though endorsed by the 
California State Student 
Association and the California 
Faculty Association, which rep-
resent CSU students and profes-

Governor must drop 
special election threats 

I f Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger gets his way, Cahformans 
will vote on many com-
plex ballot measures this 
November. Of course, like 
most voters on statewide 
initiatives in the past, the 
people who will turn out 
for the special election will 
be far whiter, far older, far 
more conservative and far 
wealthier than the average 
California voter. 

This "dual constituen-
c}''' problem is only one 
of many issues facing the 
state's initiative structure. 
Speaking on campus last 
week, former state Sen. 
Dede Alpert predicted 
that former Gov, Hiram 
Johnson - the governor 
who helped usher in the 
progressive reforms like 
the Initiative and the recall 
almost 100 years ago -
would be turning over in 
his grave if he could see 
us today. 

To begin with, the 
implementation of t.he 
initiative, designed to gIve 
voters direct power, has 
been hijacked by the spe-

cial interest groups it was 
supposed to eliminate. 
Today, only those who 
can shell out $2 million 
for paid signature collec-
tors can actually put their . 
measures on the ballot, 
and only those who can 
spend at least another $5 
million actually ever see 
their measures pass. 

The initiative has Â· also 
had a tragic effect on pub-
lic policy, essentially tying 
the hands of professional 
legislators. Unlike most 
other states, California's 
initiatives have no "sunset" 
clause and lawmakers can-
not modify outdated mea-
sures. As a result, archaic 
relics , like Proposition 13 
are likely playing a major 
role in our current budget 
crisis, something that all 
students feel in their wal-
lets. 

In the short term, the 
governor must drop his 
threats of a special election 
and actually compromise 
with the Legislature. In the 

lon~ term, the state's ini-
tiattve process needs major 
reform. 

Sun God Â· festival as 
good as UCSD gets 

Sun God is again upon us and, for one day at least, UCSD students 
have reason to celebrate. 
The annual all-campus 

. festival repeatedly trumps 
even the most persuasive 
claims of Triton apathy 
with its faux-quad day-
time activities and big-
name evening rock shows 
- and the seemingly 
requisite inebriation that 
accompanies both . 

However, students 
should al;lpreciate the day 
less for ItS exceptionality 
at a university best defined 
by scientific research than 
for its sheer, unfailing 
merit . The A.S. program-
ming office is quick to 
identify the magnitude 
and quality of the bands it 
books each year, and the 
eve nt was deemed impor-
ta nt enough to dominate 

debate in last month 's A.S. 
elections . 

The Sun God festival's 
success over the last few 
years can be measured by 
Its physical growth; the 
addition of a side stage 
at the free concert on 
RIMAC Field and the . 
expansion of Library 
Walk, Price Center and 
Sun God Lawn games, 
booths and general rev-
elry has made for an event 
not only unique by UCSD, 
standards but generally 
matchless at other UC 
campuses. 

Students should heed 
the advice of A,S. Festivals 
Co-Coordinators Eric 
Morris and Rishi Shah 
and exercise caution on 
this revered day - but by 
all means enjoy the Brd 
Sun God. This is as good 
as UCSD gets.

Beer garden coverage 

was inaccurate 
Dear Editor: 

I write to correct inaccuracies 
in a May 2 article ["Sun God beer 
garden plan rejected"] and a May 
5 editorial ["Watson's beer garden 
denial sadly predictable"] regard-
ing the recommendations of a 
committee and administrators as 
well as my stance regarding beer 
gardens at UCSD. 

Contrary to the Guardian's 
wording, the joint Associated 
Students and administration com-
mittee recommended against a 
beer garden at this year's Sun God. 
I accepted the committee's recom-
mendation after speaking with a 
number of individuals who have 
responsibilities for campus pro-
grams and activities and student 
safety and well-being. With d.e 
exception of A.S. Presidents Jenn 
Pae and Christopher Sweeten, 
everyone with whom I spoke rec-
onunended against a beer garden 
at this year's Sun God. 

to the campus community by mis-
characterizing facts and positions 
and ignoring the critical safety 
issues associated with the Sun 
God festival - with or without a 
beer garden.

has preapproval to have beer gar- I just wanted to t'espond to 
dens on those sites, subject to two items in the May 5 edition ' 
reservation conflicts. Everyone, of the Guardilm : your editorial 
including the A.S. presidents, about the anti -riot bill ["Anti-

consumption , latest outrage from conserva-

The G1IIlraill1l does a disservice tives . n 

The editorial's whining -
and it was blatant whining -
about the infringement on First 
Amendment rights was without 
merit. The bill being proposed 
in Sacramento is to punish those 
students that violate the law with 
respect to protests. 

Protesting is one "freedom" 
that is always being utilized -
just take a look at the various 
groups that protest on Library 
Walk for any given reason -
but when tho e protesters go 
beyond the sco pe of express -
ing their assorted "thoughts"

dience, well, that's where the 
police and their nightsticks step 
in to handle the unruly chil-
dren .

pen to be doin ~ it on school 
property, then the university has 
every right and responsibility to 
contain, curtail and expel the 
students th'llt actively partici-
pate in that civil disobedience 
or "riot." 

You cite former A.S. Vice 
President External Harish 
Nandagopal as an example of 
the impending "abuse" of this 
bill should it become law. When 
Nandagopal participated in the 
tuition-increase protest, he knew 
that proceeding down to La Jolla 
Village Drive and actively block-
ing traffic - sure souhds like 
civil disobedience to me - was 
going to draw the attention of the 
UCSD police.

.Sun God: Festival of outrageous expectations Letters: 
Silly protests 
not protected 
free speech 

Great 
Expectations 

carol Freire 

On the subject of expecta-tions, the UCSD Sun God festival is the big elephant 
in the room. Administrators have 
nightmares about it, and wide-
eyed freshmen have visions of 
spiked sugarplums dancing in 
their heads . Seasoned veterans 
pass down exaggerated lore of 
Sun Gods past and try to one-up 
each other with how many outra-
geous antics they can remem-
ber - or how many they can't 
remember. Meetings and mid-
terms are postponed by the savvy. 
Sun God is a hair's breadth away 
from being officially recognized 
as a local holiday. 

I say huzzah for local holi-
days, because we work too hard. 
Americans have forged ahead 
of the Japanese and Germans, 
leading the pack of industrial-
ized nations for worlcing hours, 
according to the International 
Labor Office. As Steven Hill 
says, "Americans win the gold 
for working longer hours for less 
pay." 

Time to get off of the hamster 
wheel and let it spin empty for a 
while. What are we worlcing so 
hard for - to amass a towering 
pile of pennies under our mat-
tresses? You can't take that with 
you when you die. 

Don't get me wrong, I believe 
in financial discipline and retire-
ment accounts - but if you 
know anything about finance, 
you understand that worlcing to 
the bone for higher income does 

not guarantee financial indepen-
dence. Furthermore, worlcing 
longer does not mean worlcing 
more efficiently, and it certainly 
does not equate to a better qual-
ity of life. We could all use a 
break. . 

Administrators, police and 
university staff are expecting 
anything but a break, though, 
on this fun-filled Friday. They 
fear bacchanalian hordes of 
students rampaging drunk and 
high around campus, passing out 
on any grassy space, red with 
either sunburn or acetaldehyde 
buildup. The security around this 
Sun God should rival Operation 
Gatekeeper, thanks to the nonex-
istent beer garden. (Don't fall for 
that one next time, A.S. Council!) 
Students visibly intoxicated will 
not be let in, freshmen at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College hosting parties 
will have their housing contracts 
revoked, and a panopticon will 
be installed in RIMAC Arena. I 
would be equally apprehensive 
and prepared if I had 20,339 
potentially intoxicated wards to 
look after. The only trouble is, 
students are not wards of the uni-
versity, nor should they be. 

First off, let's deflate our out-
rageous expectations: not every-
one drinks. Second, not everyone. 
drinks irresponsibly. Bingeing 
is so passe, while having a good 
time is not. Third, the American 
obsession with alcohol should be 
examined, because our present 
substance control policy is not 
working. It is instead potentially 
exacerbating alcoholism by driv-
ing people to drinlc secretly and 
preventing them from seeking 
help in fear of the consequences. 
Woefully, I cannot single-hand-
edly reverse SOllib Dakota v. Doylt 
and let reasonable states keep their 

drinlcing age at 18. Instead I'll JUSt 
fume in the corner with Justice 
O'Connor, thank you very much . 

We could all enjoy Sun God 
if we could get past the alco-
hol issue . Here is my solution: 
I support personal responsibil-
ity. In my simplistic world, every 
potential ward of the university 
would sign a waiver relieving the 
university of liability and talcing 
on personal responsibility for his 
or her actions , You . could die 
if you're stupid, but you could 
also die by acting stupidly on an 
Outback Adventures rock-climb-
ing trip. That's why you sign the 
waiver. If you're old enough to 
vote, buy cigarettes and choose 
a career path while attending a 
university, you're old enough to 
make your own decisions. 

Your parents have done all 
they can to raise you, and now 
you're on your own. This would 
relieve RAs and RSOs of their 
baby-sitting duties. It would also 
potentially relieve them entirely 
of their jobs. However, RAs could 
then focus on programs and true 
community building, and RSOs 
could enforce quiet hours or 
something. In any case, I'm sure 
other jobs would be found, as this 
universi ty is one of the largest, 
most decentrali zed bureaucracies 
known to man. 

Once we've moved past the 
alcohol issue, we can focus on 
other positive aspects of our 
uniquely UCSD campus-unify-
ing tradition. As a campus, we've 
viscerally rejected the slogan 
"Tradition of no traditions" for 
good reason, Usually, though not 
this year, Sun God is on the third 
Friday of May. The main activity 
involves catching up with as many 
,friends and acquaintances as pos-
sible. It's a free pass to relcindle 

that welcome-week flame and to 
bounce like a 2 -year-old on the 
oversized inflatables. 

Traditionally, we have just-
OK lineups, although it's always a 
point of lively contention wheth-
er it rocks or sucks. One year, 
the Muir Q1IIlrttr/y ran the head-
line "U2 or a shitty local band 
to headline at Sun God." The 
point, of course, was to satirize 
the A.S. programming office's 
inability to book A-list bands 
and defiantly persistent yearly 
rumors that this year would be 
different, Some people around 
campus were ' eagerly expecting 
Bono. Editors joked that they 
should forcibly retract newspa-
pers from readers who thought 
this was factual, either from their 
inability to understand satire or 
from their lack of a right cerebral 
hemisphere. 

That point was made again 
last month. As an RA, I've had 
the uncomfortable job of explain-
ing all throughout April that 
while the G1IIlrdian did run a 
front-page, above-the-fold head-
line about Ashlee Simpson head-
lining Sun God, this was, in fact, 
an April Fool's joke. Don't expect 
her - she is not coming. I hope 
that cleared it up for everybody. 
You understand how uncomfort-
able clearing this up is if you've 
ever had to explain an unfunny 
joke. Repeatedly. A month after 
it happened. 

That's the last expectation that 
needed deflating. Now if you'll 
excuse me, I'm going to get ready 
for an awesome Sun God, and I 
suggest you join me.

THlIRSMV. MAY 12. 2005 

USSA:Â· Council divided on 
proposed increases in dues 

continued from page J 
dues, the budget constraints facing 
the council include the addition of 
extra costs associated with stipends 
for employees of A.S. Lecture 
Notes, A.S. Soft Reserves and the 
UCSD Challenge Course, which is 
run joindy by the council and the 
university'S recreation department. 
These stipends are traditionally 
funded through the earnings of the 
enterprises, but must be included 
in the 2005-06 budget because of 
their low profits. 

Additionally, the council's pro-
jected student fee revenue is cur-
rently estimated to be $100,000 
less than the 2004-05 budget. 

In response, Sweeten has pro-
posed cuts to almost every sec-
tion of the A.S. budget, with only 
the USSA and UCSA membership 
fees, lobbying funds and adminis-
trative salaries receiving increases. 
As part of the wide-ranging cuts, 
the programming line item, which 
funds events such as the Sun God 
festival, may see reductions of more 
than $16,000, if approved. In addi-
tion, the Student Organizations 
Unallocated division, which man-
ages money set aside for on-cam-
pus groups, would lose more than 
$15,000. 

Student Affirmative Action 
Coalition Representative Jacob 
Davis said that, although on-campus 
services more directly benefit stu-
dents, the lobbying groups pro\~ded 
substantial returns. 

College Freshman Senator Ben 
Sumner, said that they support the 
increases . 

"It is better to have an organiza-
tion that is dedicated to lobbying," 
Sumner said. "If we decide to be a 
part [of the organizations), then w e 
need to pay our fees." 

Pill on, however, said that she 
did not support these increases 
considering the current budgetary 
constraints. 

"I would love for us to be a full 
member [in USSA) , but I do not 
see us as having the money," Pillon 
said. "Too much is getting cut too 
drastically. I would like to see more 
money go to college councils." 

In the previous school year, the 
college councils received a base-
allocation from Associated Students 
of S3,500, as well as 50 cents per, 
student. In the current draft of 
the budget, however, Sweeten has 
proposed an allocation of 70 cents 
per student with no base allocation. 
As a resul t, smaller colleges, such as 
Sixth College, would receive sub-
stantially smaller allocations than 
in previous years. 

Former A.S. Vice President 
External Rigo Marquez said, how-
ever, that membership in the lob-
bying organizations provides many 
tangible benefits for the campus. 

"[1bey] give us a voice that we 
need," Marquez sa id. "Students may 
not see the results, but we're lobbyin g 
in Sacramento and Oakland to keep 
OUf fees low. I f we don 't have peopl e 
paying attention, [the Regents :lnd 
UC Office of the President) can take 
advantage of us." 

To advertise in the Guardian special June 2 graduation issue, call: 

"If we don't pay for [the increas-
es), we lose the service," Davis said . 
"If we do pay for it, it takes money 
away from other things that direct-
ly affect students. But it affects 

~ture stu~ents and I support [the 
Increases) . 

Discussions over the final ver-
sion of the budget will continue 
over the next few weeks . (858) 534 ... 3467

ByVU MAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

After a long day full of Sun God's intoxicating pleasures, what's better than strapping 
on some comfY shoes, grabbing 
yOUT friends and heading over 
to RIMAC Field to whet your 
Marley spirits? Two members 
of the first family of reggae wiU 
be there: Damian Marley (son 
of reggae legend Bob Marley 
and Jamaica's 1977 Miss World 
Cindy Brealcspeare) and brother 
Stephen, earning his keep behind 
the drwll kit. 

strongly advocates his bond 
with his Jamaican-American 
culrural background, whil e 
older brother Stephen likes to 
fiddle around with remakes of 
his father's greatest hits with 
other popular artists such as 
Erykah Badu and Lauren Hill. 
Stephen is acrually more well-
known as a songwriter and 
doesn't usually boast his inher-
ited Bob-esque smile in the 
public scene . However, he is 
making tIlis entran ce perfor-
mance with his baby brother 
Damian in honor of our great 
Sun God. 

his concert cameo will be a good 
showcase of the modem genera-
tion of regglle. 

Come sing along to the col-
ors of yellow, green and red, 
and if that isn't a high enough 
buzz, come mingle in the brew 
of sweat and head-nodding of 
fellow UCSD peeps. If you 're 
not a big reggae fan, you don't 
dig the floppy colorful hats , or 
you are pretty much coming 
to Sun God to see Ludacris, 
at least enjoy the mixture of 
the Empire and the different 
colors of the Marley legacy as 
an interesting littl e twist on the 
traditions of this wonderful day 
of drunken merriment. And if 
you're looking for any other 
reason to experi e nce this por-
tion of Sun God - it'll just be 
really cool to see two Marleys 
in less than an hour . 

Despite many deals with 
Motown Records, the two 
Marley brothers have kept 
their careers underground with 
severa I reggac-ba cd groll ps. 
Known as "Junior Gong" in 

music scene, little Damian 

Maybe Damian will even puff 
out some newly written urnes 
from his album Halfwny Tree

For one reason only: to ensure 
that you, me UCSD srudcllt who 
will be drunk from head to toc, 
will attend the Sun God festival. 
It is to ensure that yOll a re steered 
away from high-art perfonllances 
such as the Spring Mu ic Festival 
- you are to ignore culture for at 
least one day. 

And there is nothing wrong 
with that. Let's face it: High 
culture can be boring if we take 
music se riously nil the time. 
While some enthusiasts will 
argue thar music is a rea lm that 
must be kept serious and sacred 
for etemi ty , serious music loses 
.)luman value if we degrade it to 
some super-elite value. Human 
value is to enjoy life, and as 
crazy as it sounds, two of the 
many joys of life are to puke and 
make out with your TA. 

So, while Pretty Girls Make 
Graves are a band for serious indi c 
fans, and serious listeners should 
always listen intently to the music, 
there will be nothing wrong if 
people pay no attention at all to 
the band and continue on with the 
puking and making out. In fuct, 
it's healthy if, for onc day, serious 
music funs le t go of thei r egos and 
simply shake their ass silly. 

Unles of course, this is all just 
a plot to keep the indie freaks out 
of the Spring Music Festival.

By CODY NABOURS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Some.time in the early part of the century, something happened in New York City, spawning wave 
after wave of Camel-smolOng, Velvet 
Underground-evolOng, analog equip-
ment-using, Heineken-boozing, Joy 
Division-worshipping, hipster-tai-
lored, apathetic (but intense) and 
undeniably excellent-sounding bands . 
Progenitors of this mass exodus to 
the promised land of the airwaves 
were the fab-five Strokes, but catch-
ing the draft behind them were such 
acts as Interpol, Radio 4, the Yeah 
Yeah Yeahs, Liars, French Kicks and, 
yes, the Walkmen. Given the 'in' by 
the Strokes. the comparative fates of 
these NYC babies read like the line-
up for the Wu-Tang Clan: A few have 
maintained their indie status while 
others have become superstars. I don't 
think any of them are dead yet. (R.I.P. 
Dirt McGirt ODB.) The Walkmen 
have taken the superstar (well, almost) 
route and inevitably, since their live 
gig on "The OC," have turned to the 
business of cell phone ringtones and 
mainstream media exposure. 

The Wallanen aren't opportunistic 
sellouts, however. They were once 
two bands, the Recoys and Jonathan 
Fire Eater, the latter of which were 
signed to Dreamworks in the late 
'90s, fetching cri tical success and, as 
always, commercial failure . The rem-
nants of the band bought and fixed up 
a studio, called Marcata Recording, 
with the leftover money from the 
Dreamworks days. The studio features 
a distinct acoustic signature, aided by 
the vintage analog equipment they 
keep lying around to impress visitors. 
With studio in hand, the next step was 
to put together a new band, formed by 
tight-knit childhood friends. the band 

that would become the Walkmen. 
From Jonathan F ire Ea ter came Matt 
Barrick (drums), Paul Maroon (guitar) 
and Walter Martin (organs/vocals), 
and from the Recoys came Peter 
Bauer (bass) and Hamilton Leithauser 
(vocals). 

In 2002, the WaUanen released their 
debut LP. Everyone Who Pretended to 
Like Me is Gme, to critical praise. The 
album is the winter dream of the city, 
groggily warm and understanding but 
bitterly cold and lonely. Its atmosphere 
perfectly complements the band's spare 
and cozy sound. helped by the distinc-
tive Marcata studio. Their second LP, 
2004's Bows and Arrows, signaled their 
major label debut for Warner Bros. 
Record Collection. It is not quite as 
perfectly imperfect as their debut, but 
it maintains the same sound, something 
romantic and furious, masked by the 
sewer fog of the city, fully creative and 
uncompromising despite the major-label 
representation. 

Music of wintry New York City may 
not seem to have a place in the sunny 
landscape of Orange County filtered 
through Fox's sensational lens, but 
the band's performance in the episode 
marked a new level of exposure for .. . 
well, not really. It seems you can lead 
aU the OC cows to water, but you can't 
make them drink - or listen to good 
music, either. Regardless, playing on a 
primetime soap opera has ind ubitably 
induced "sellout" disorder in many 
fans, to which Hamilton Leithauser 
responds, "I'm not sure what I'd say .. . 
maybe 'fuck you .... And he's right; 
playing on a crap show does not make 
a crap band. 

Let's see i( these boys can entertain 
the droves of UCSD just like they did 
the crowd at the Bait Shop (who were 
all faking it). or if the Walkmen play-
ing live is a proposition only for the 
screen .

Staff Writer 

If someone asks about Phantom Planet, there are three typical responses: it's the band with Jason Schwartzman 
(of "Rushmore" fame) in it, or it is a 
popular 1960s sci-fi movie, or, more 
commonly, it is the band that created 
that absurdly catchy "California" song 
that started as the theme song for the 
show "90210" - I mean "The OC" 
- and ended up transforming into the 
theme song for all things trendy. Since 
Schwartzman's departure a couple of 
years ago, the latter is the only state-
ment that holds true. 

(ditto), Phantom Planet never dove into 
the hard stuff, settling on pop rock and 
sticking with it . 

Those unfamiliar with Phantom 
Planet may be surprised to find they 
have recorded a lot more than their 
popular ballad; they have been critics' 
favorites since they released their debm 
albwn in 1997. At that time they were 
all still teenagers; all from upper-class 
Los Angeles up-bringings and all in the 
process of dropping out of college to 
pursue some rock 'n'roll. 

With influences Like the Beatles 
(who doesn't list them as an influ-
ence?), Elvis Costello and Radiohead 

By CODY NAIOURS 
Senior Staff Writer 

They are not exactly a rocker's 
dream choice; those that will be count-
ing the nwnber of times Luda refers 
to his "bitches" or his "Cadillacs" may 
be disappointed with Phantom Planet's 
embraced experimentation with pop. 
They don't hide that filet. Take the punk ' 
out of Weezer or the garage out of the 
Strokes and you may be nearing Phantom 
Planet's unapologetically sunny version 
of rock 'n' roll that was most notice-
able on their second albwn, The Gum, 
but has stuck with them throughout the 
years. In their defense, Phantom Planet 
still have a unique sound, and they aren't 
afraid to try new things. With their self-
titled third album, they have flined with 
a harder sound. Their new single, "Big 
Brat," sounds like a dang good impres-
sion of the Strokes. 

Moshing may at times be replaced 
by singing along, but don't complain 
too much since, come May 13, there's a 
good chance you'll. be singing, "We've 
been on the run, driving in the sun, 
looking out for number one" with the 
rest of the crowd. 

Oozing up from the synthetic sprawl of the Inland Empire is Rulio, a pop-punk-emo foursome named 
(hopeful1y) for the dirty, brat-faced lead-
er of the Lost Boys in 1991's "Hook." 
The movie is - under any critical eye 
~ absolute shit, but it reminds us aU of 
our childhoods. So too is Rutio's deriva-
tive but authentic sounding pop-punk, 
which sounds just lilce that music we 
used to listen to in high school. 

The boys rock in the style of pop-
punk banner carriers Blink- l 82, with 
an emo touch added to their Rancho 
Cucamonga snazz (hey, it must be 
depressing to be from the 909). But 
hey, Sun God isn't about music 
appreciation, it's about drunken rev-
elry. Perhaps, under the guidance of 
the institution that is Rufio, we can 
be just like the Lost Boys, reliving 
the footloose and fancy-free days of 
our comparative youth and joining 
in a chorus of "Rufio! Rufio! RU-FI-
OOOOOOO!"

NIBe Inch Nalls 
With Teeth 

Sub Pop 

*** 

Sixteen years since Trent Reznor brought indus-trial music to the masses 
with the release of Pretty 
lhtt M8chint, the master-
mind of Nine Inch Nails 
proves he's content to stay 
within his niche on NIN's 
latest album, With Teeth . 

Reznor's blend of darlc, 
ferocious lyrics and indus-
trial rhythms on Prttty Hatt 
MlIChint and its follow-up. 
The DuwmJJard Spiral, was 
hugely influential on heavy-
metal and alternative-rock 
bands. (Fans mostly over-

looked NIN's last album, 
\999's Thr Fragilt , even 
though it had some of 
Reznor's best work in recent 
years.) 

However, on With 
Ttlth, Reznor seems to be 
reaching out to a broader 
audience, creating a sharp-
er, more focused sound. 
Although it features some 
of Dave Grohl's bone-jar-
ring drumming on the tracks 
"Getting Smaller" and "The 
Collector," With Tmh 
doesn't have any great, gutÂ· 
wrenching songs like "March 
of the Pigs" and "Head Like 
a Hole" that previously made 
NIN's reputation. 

Instead, the highlights 
of With Tttth are some of 
the mellower tracks, such as 
"Only" and "All the Love 
in the World." Reznor does 
not break new ground. but 
his use of the synthesizer on 
"Only" and "Sunspots" and 
the slow buildup and ulti-
mate explosive conclusion of 
"All the Love in the World" 
show that Reznor is evolving 
into a slightly less abrasive 
artist.

The Eels 
Blinking Lights and 
Other Revelations 

Vagrant 

**~ 
The double albwn is pan-demic in modem times, and most always ends 
in a single album of great 
songs jumbled together with 
an albwn of boring filler, 
so that you have to suffer 
through the bad to hear the 
occasional good. Just like a 
glass half filled with beer 
and half filled with urine is 
a full glass of urine. the rare 
good tracks on the Eels' new 
double album are not worth 
the dregs that pollute more 
than half of it. 

E, the leaderrrrent 
Reznor of the Eels is highly 
regarded in old-sad-bas-
tard-music circles. Mter 
his most recent blandness, 
Shootmanny, the door was 
left wide open for the career-
slwnp-ending double albwn. 

So, how about a concept 
album about a boy grow-
ing up. written as if the boy 
wrote the lyrics himself? 

The problem here is that 
instead of reading "Portrait 
of the Artist as a Young Man" 
to prep, the Eels just checked 
out the bad cover. Instead 
of E's toothily macabre wit, 
we get middle-school sap. It 
isn't clever to write terrible 
lyrics if one can write good 
ones. Bob Dylan taught us 
that. Ditching the electronic 
textures of his past efforts for 
alt-country instrumentation 
doesn't help much. either; it 
highlights the unimaginative 
melodies of his many (I say. 
many) piano dirge-ballads. 

There may be an albwn's 
worth of good music on 
here, but it would take less 
effort to put it on another 
Eels albwn instead.

Weeler 
Make Believe 
Geffen Records 

Rivers Cuomo, you are at it again with your nerd-boy dunn and pretty 
voice - and this time it 
really works. Malct Btlirve 
proves that the little hiatus 
Weezer took after their last 
albwn was time well-spent. 

There's a catch. Make 
Btlirvt is put together 
very well, but the sound 
is so very different from 
Weezer's usual style that 
it takes some initial adjust-
ment. Although the band's 
quirky bass riffs are still 
detectable, it seems like 

Weezcr have decided to 
give Cuomo's boyish voice 
tile highlight it deserves. 
Make Believe is a little less 
silly alternative hardcorc 
guitar, a little more melodic 
and emotional, and a whole 
lot mon! vocal. Cuomo 
deli vers his vocal work 
with much more feeli ng 
than ever before, as heard 
in " Haunt You Everyday," 
where he croons away with 
a touch of melancholic 
whine. 

Weezer have matured 
lyrically as well. A lot of the 
tunes in Make Believe take a 
step further from Weezer's 
"Buddy Holly" days. There 
are no more of the sarcas-
tic warbles. Rather, Weezer 
wrote Makt Believt with a 
hidden sorrow that really 
complements its riffS. 

After many TW1-throughs 
of deep lyrics and emotional 
tracks. one can certai nly get 
too much of Cuomo's heart-
breaking anthems. But the 
superb highlights can defi-
nitely get one to believe in 
Weezer's most recent come-
back.

awful, like sour mash and yeast 
and burns. The drink to combat 
alcohol halitosis: the gin and 
tonic. Just like Kramer and the 
no-smell, no-tell scotch, if you 
throw down a gin and tonic, you 
can walk around drunk all day, 
and still smell like juniper ber-
ries and lime - the scent of the 
Expeditionary British Empire. 
I used this to my advantage 
once on a lone Friday class, 
the fewer-than-20-person Muir 
Writing 50. Needless to say, 
this particular morning, I was 
for once an active participant 
in the discussion instead of a 
stoic wallflower and nod artist 
as always . TA Ryan, ifI ran into 
you that glorious Sun qod, you 
would have faced my second 
tradition: the janie-dazzle joint 
that reunites lost friends during 
the chaos, making bonds with 
TAs and hot girls alike. Gin, 
tonic and jazzles. That's Sun 
God to me. - C.N. 

Drunk naps Dot allowed 

Noone wants to be ".that gu ." You know what I'm talbng about. The guy who 
says he's going back to his room 
to pick up something, only to 
disappear until Saturday. Much 
is made of the drunken nap that 
seems inevitable when alcohol 
imbibing commences at 10 in 
the morning; however, this 
seemingly unavoidable prob-

lem has an easy remedy . Too 
many people are all about the 
downers (alcohol, weed, your 
girlfriend) during Sun God, 
but working in a coffee shop 
for two years will show you 
the beauty of the picker-upper 
we call caffeine. Working the 
opening shift at a coffee shop 
on campus the day of Sun God 
is far from ideal, but being 
witness to the brilliance of 
Irish coffee made it all worth 
it. While the combination of 
coffee and alcohol makes for 
some fascinating trips to the 
toilet, drunken naps become a 
mere afterthought as your body 
engages in a constant conflict 
between the various substanc-
es taking years off your life. 
Cheers, bitches. - A.S. 

Everyone's your friend! 

U CSD students are normal-ly about as sociable as a geriatric tortoise. Which is 
what makes Sun God - where 
a little sun and music tum your 
average science-type into a 
liquor-swilling "What's up?" 
machine - such a fun event. 
You know those people you see 
every day but never talk to? On 
Sun God, they're your fritnds, 
which means you can feel free 
to spit, bitch or lob any ran-
dom thought that crosses your 
mind toward them. Most likely, 
they'll be wearing the "every-
one's-my-pal" goggles too - so 
you don't have to worry about 
any embarrassing memories 
popping up later. - I .S.P. 

Midterms + Sun God. BAD 

Since I no longer have one of those classes where the teacher thinks he or she can 
have more than one midterm, 
this is the first year I will not 
face a test on the day of Sun 
God. 

For those of you who aren't 
so lucley, you are faced with 
a choice. Maybe you should 
have dropped the class once you 
heard from the person who, at 
the exact moment the syllabus 
was passed out, announced to 
the class that the midterm fell 
on the day of Sun God. (You 
would have had a great excuse 
to use when you had to explain 
to your parents why you are 
only taking 12 units.) It's too 
late now, though; the midterm 
is going to happen. 

Depending on what time 
your midterm is (or maybe 
not), you can show up drunk to 
the test, already accepting that 
you're going to fail, and pray 
that the professor wi II drop the 
lowest midterm grade. From my 
experience, plenty choose the 
option above. 

Then there's the other 
option - the dork option, you 
could call it (but I'm not going 
to, because it's what I've done 
for the last two years): Suck 
it up, take the test like it's a 
normal day, and ride the beau-
tiful curve that comes with a 
class full of students wi th one 
thing on their minds - alcohol. 
There's plenty of time to have 
fun afterwards. - J,N.

"We have a really good chance 
at beating OCC," junior Ryan Tool 
said. "Every time we race them we 
finish closer and closer to them." 

The novice-eight boat proved 
they deserved the chance for a 
rem a tch during the first heat. The 
team clocked in at 6: 15.3, just 
slightly behind the top-ranked 
team, University of Virginia, which 
finished the race at 6: 12.1. 

"Mter working really hard at 
practice this last week, we did not 
only really deserve a chance for a 
rematch against OCC, but also a 
medal at nationals," Tool said. 

Two races later, UCSD indeed 
was given the shot to overcome 
the one-second difference that 

While members of the UCSD 
novice team was pulling their 
boat from the racks and prepar-
ing for the final race, they were 
informed of unfortunate news by 
their coach, who announced that 
the race was canceled due to strong 
winds. The varsity team also found 
out that their semifinal race was 
canceled due to adverse weather 
conditions. 

"We were all really disappoint-
ed," Tool said. "Not only did we 
have the chance to race against 
some great East Coast schools like 
Trinity, but we were also going 
to have the opportunity to finally 

As the strong winds blew 
through Worcester, the UCSD 
men's crew season came to a sud-
den close. Although they will 
never know their true place among 
the nation's elite teams, the Tritons 
were still able to prove they could 
race with the best. 

"The trip across the country 
was definitely worth it," Tool said. 
"We showed that we can beat some 
of the top-ranked schools." 

Even though the season has just 
ended and the team members will 
not race again until next season, it 
has not stopped them from making 
future goals. 

"There is only one goal that we 
probably have in our minds right 
now for next season," Tool said. 
"And that is to actually get the 
boat completely in the water for 
the grand final."

ported the team with her third 
and fourth-place finishes in the 
lOO-meter and 200-meter dashes. 
Freshman Laiah Blue took fourth 
and fifth in the lOO-meter and 400-
meter hurdles. 

In the steeplechase competition,

freshman Kara Cross finished fourth 
and eighth, respectively. Junior 
Briana Hinga took third in the hep-
tathlon with 4296 points and team-
mate junior Amy Beeman finished 
fourth with 4166 points. 

For the men , junior Mike 
Cunningham was the CCAA 
champion in the 110 hurdles. His 

time of 14.43 was a half-second 
faster than the second-place fin-
isher. Cunningham pulled off sec-
ond-place finishes in the 400 hur-
dles and the 400 run with times of 
52.66 and 49.01, respectively. In 
turn, teammate junior Jon Patton 
received third in the 110 hurdles 
at 14.78 and fourth in the 200 
dash, crossing the finish line at 
21.92. 

For distance events, senior 
Luke Sigmon garnered seventh and 
eighth place finishes in the 5,000 and 
10,000 runs, finishing at 15:58.89 
and 34:09.98, respectively. 

Freshman Matt Noble surprised

to capitalize off Pollock's unforced 
errors and frustration to quicldy put 
away the match. 

Oijala pulled off the win at No. 
4 singles against Hawaii's Mitchel 
Gelina with a 6-1, 2-6, 6-1 viLwry. 
Oijala overwhelmed Gelina in the 
first set and was able to capture his 
concentration again in the third 
set to close out the match for the 
Tritons. 

At No. 1 singles, Swatt had dif-
ficulty against Hawaii's Moitry who 
won 6-4, 6-3. 

At No. 3 singles, Spector was up 
2-0 in the third set after winning 
the first 7-6 and losing the second 
2-6. 

At No. 5 singles, Meister was 
leading Hayley, 6-3 , 1-6,2-1, while 
Phan, at No.' 6 singles, was on the 
brink of defeating Lars Melskens, 
7-5,4-1. 

The match was a test of strength 
for the young Triton team; few had 
expected the season to tum out so 
well and May 7's match proved that 
the Tritons are ready to compete 
with the best. 

The Tritons now hold a 14-6 
overall record and are ranked 21st 
in the nation. The men have won 
five of their last six matches, three 
of which were against Division I 
opponents. 

In 2004, the Tritons were in the 
same position but were ousted by 
eventual national champions West 
Florida in the first round. This 
season, they will head to Altamonte 
Springs, Fla. on May 12 to bce 
their first-round opponents at the 
NCAA Division IT Nationals.

New teams provide 
excitement for playoffs 

Women's track crowned CCAA Champs 
Salerno named conference coach of the year 

Joe Tevelowiu 
hat do Reggie Miller, 
Larry Bird, Dominique 
Wilkins and Derek Fisher 

have in common? All four created 
their images' of playoff lore not in 
the NBA Finals, nor even the con-
ference finals, but in their re pec-
tive conference semifinals. 

The NBA playoffs, in their long, 
drawn-out and ever increa ing for-
mat - both in terms of media 
hype and time I spend watching 
them instead of doing that essay 
for my writing class - have pro-
vided numerous memories along 
the way. Ilowever, it eems that 
whenever somebody wants to think 
up an NBA-playoff memory, they 
go to those that happened on the 
large tages, like Michael Jordan's 
" hot, Part 2" against the Jazz in 
the '98 Finals or Magic John on's 
baby-hook over Boston in the '87 
Fina ls. Even when moments like 
the Fisher Point-Four Fling, or the 
original "Shot" that Jordan sunk 
ove r leveland Cavaliers guard 
Craig Ehlo in the 1989 playoffs 
are reminisced about, they seem 
to be hyped more than necessary. 
Jordan's shot over Ehlo didn't win 
the Bulls a title; it didn't even send 

them to the NBA or Conference 
Finals. It was the decisive shot in a 
fim-round match up, even though 
it would go on to be symbolic of 
things so much bigger than a best-
of-five series. 

What tends to bring excitement 
to the conference semifinals is the 
fact that the teams that are meet-
ing, like Miller's Pacers and the 
Knicks, have some familiarity with 
one another. Teams that have met 
and battled know one another well. 
So, how about this year? Well, 
this year in the conference semifi-
nals we've got ... the Washington 
Wizards?! No, the Conference 

emifinals th is year don't offer the 
arne background - the same epic 

set-up - of years past. Sure, we 
have a defending champion meet-
ing with a bitter foe, but that foe 
has seemingly already been deplet-
ed, and not by the direct hand of 
the champion. And we have a man, 
or maybe a monster, on a path of 
revenge. 

Unfortunately, the path is on 
the oppo ite side of the country 
from where the last path ended. In 
the wake of bitter rivalries, we are 
left with three teams who were not 
even part of the playoffs last year 
and thus unable to conjure up leg-
endary images of any past playoff 
battles. 

Don't get me wrong, I'll still 
watch and be glued to every minute 
of action, be it fa st-paced, defensive

The track and field season may 
be winding down, but the Tritons 
are not losing any momentum in 
their final competitions. The wom-
en's track and field team captured 
its first championship on May 7 at 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships and 
the men's squad finished third. The 
women eclipsed defending champi-
on and host Chico State, nartowly 
outscoring the Wildcats 199.5 to 
198. In addition, head coach Tony 
Salerno was named the CCAA 
Women's Coach of the Year. 

"The meet was one of the most 
exciting meets I've been involved 
with in the 25 years I've been 
coaching at the collegiate level," 
Salerno said. "There is a tremen-
dous rivalry between us and Chico. 
This is a landmark for us, and 
something we've been working 
toward aLI year." 

Salerno was bestowed the title 
of Women's Coach of the Year after 
the other coaches at the conference 
voted on the award. 

"It's a great honor to have the 
other ,coaches honor you," he said. 
"But this is not just the head coach's 
award - it's on behalf of the other 
coaches on staff, too." 

For the women, senior Kendra 
Canape regained her title as the 
CCAA high jump champion, a 
title she previously held in 2003 .

Men's Â·tennis heads to Nationals 
Tritons beat Hawaii-Hilo, advance to Round of 16 

By ANCELA M. LIN 
Senior Staff Writer 

This has been quite a season for 
the UCSD men's tenni team, who 
lost four seniors, rerurned only 
four players and added a handful 
of freshmen to the squad at the 
beginning of the season. T his year 
did not look to be as promi ing as 
2004, when the team made a run 
at the NCAA Divi ion n Round of 
16 National Championships. 

"This year's team is quite young 
from a match-experience perspec-
tive," head coach Eric Steidlmayer 
said at the beginning of the season. 
"We don't have the seasoned vet-
erans like we did last year." 

However, after only a couple of 
months. the team has started play-
ing like seasoned veterans. With 
fou r freshmen added onto the ros-
ter, the men accomplished their 
goal of making the Round of 16 by 
beating rival Hawaii-Hilo on May 
7 at Northview Tennis Courts. 

The Tritons hosted the Vulcans 
for the second time this year after a 
7-2 Triton victory in the first meet-
ing on Feb. 25 at the Northview 
Tennis Courts in front of a large 
home crowd. 

UCSD jumped out in ftont 
early with a doubles sweep. At No. 
1 singles, sophomore eth Spector 
and junior Brent Molden quick-
ly disposed of Hawaii 's Jeremy 
Moitry and Steffan Moritz, 8-4 
while the o. 2 doubles team of 
senior captain Bryan watt and 
freshman Will Phan defeated their 
opponents, 8-3. 

Junior Erik ijala and fre 'hman 
Blake Meister defeated Hawa ii 's 
Ned Hayley and Fuyuki amejima, 
8-2, se uring the win with a ee-
sawing match point that ended 
with a nice winning hot down the

line past Hayley at the net. 

Heading into the singles line-
up, the excitement and buzz of 
being two matche away from the 
Round of 16 was in the air. 

The Tritons' 3-0 lead after the 
doubles line-up pumped them up, 

and it did not take too long to win 
the fifth match. 

t No. 2, Molden defeated a 
very erratic Pollock in a quick

comfortable two inches better than 
her closest competitor. 

Junior Mimi Hodgins and senior 
Lindsay Stalker finished first and 
second in the 800-meter, crossing 
the line at 2 minutes, 11 .73 seconds 
and 2:11.84, respectively. 

For the 1,500, the pair finished 
1-2 once again, this time with 
Stalker taking first in a time of 
4:42.78 and Hodgins finishing at 
4:42.82. 

"We actually planned it ahead 
of time," Hodgins said, adding that 
she and Stalker were ranked first 
and second in both events. "This 
meet was all about the team, and J 
didn't want to race my teammate. 
There's no need for us to race right 
now. It's pretty amazing that we 
were that highly ranked and that we 
were able to do that." 

Freshman Whitney Johnson 
received second place overall in the 
women's oiple jump with her mark 
of 11 .86 meters. , 

But a championship is not built 
on first- and second-place finishes 
alone. In a sport like track and 
field, a championship team requires 
depth. 

Freshmen Diane Dunn and 
Katie Olson and junior MicheUe 
DiMeo rounded out the 1,500 as 
the Triton women took 1-2-3-4-5, 
earning the team 33 points in a 
single event The Triton women 
had never swept an event before. 

"It was the first time in UCSD 
history that there were three girls 
on the award podium," Hodgins

Tritons finish second at 
WIRA Championships 
Carriker, Sendowski and Oliver

By MICHAEL NEUmDTER 

Staff Writer 

After spending most of the 
season racing every weekend, the 
UCSD men's crew team finally had 
a weekend without an official race, 
having endured their last race of 
the regular season, the ewport 
Invitational and the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championships on April 30 and 
May 1 at Lake Natoma, Calif. But 
the team did not let the break in 
its schedule end the trend of top 
finishes, coming in second in the 
field of 20 teams at the WIRA 
Championship.

erhouses including UC Berkeley. 
The Tritons clocked in at 6:10.8, 
just after Orange County College'S 
6:09.8. Sonoma State, Washington 
State and UC Davis rounded out

Men's Second Varsity Eight Final, 
fini hing in second place with a 
time of 6: 16.8, while the Aggies 

clocked in slightly ahead at 6: 14.1. 
The Gonzaga Bulldogs finished 
third, clocking in at 6:18.6. 

The men's varsity-eight boat 
finished off the day for the Tritons. 
After the final race, the team fin-
ished second in its heats on April

eighrs terific season earned them 
a spot to race in the National 
Invitational Collegiate Regatta in

in fourth as its boat clocked in 
at 6:07.3. University of Virginia
