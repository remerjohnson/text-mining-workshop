CalPIRG has phones 
ringing off the hook 
Group convinces students to 
call LaSuer and demand change 
By LAURA McGANN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD chapter of the 
California Public Interest 
Research Group was out cam-
paigning on Library Walk 
Wednesday for a familiar cause 
- increased renewable energy 
- but its tactics used in this 
instance were a little different. 

The group provided cell 
phones for people to call state 
Assemblyman Jay LaSuer's 
office and encourage him to 
vote for Senate BiJl 532 as part 

of "Speak Out Day," where 
CalPIRG members from the 
UC campuses encouraged stu-
dents to call local state officials. 

LaSuer, a Republican, repre-
sents Assembly District 77, 
which runs up against the south-
east border of the city of San 
Diego. District 77 includes the 
cities of La Mesa, EI Cajon, 
Spring Valley and Bonita. 

CalPIRG targeted him 
because the organization's mem-
bers believe he is a critical swing

Grad students pass 
o.n paying more fees 
U ndergrads will now have to pay a 
larger fee if the referendum passes 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD Graduate Student 
Association balked at its lack of 
involvement in crafting the ath-
letics fee referendum, resulting in 
increased cost for undergraduates 
should the referendum pass. 

Graduate students chose to be 
excluded from the referendum, so 
if it passes, only undergraduates 
will pay fees to finance the 
National Collegiate Athletics 
Association program. 

The new version, amended to 
exclude graduate students from 
the vote, passed the A.S. Council 
last week. 

The amount requested via the 
referendum had to be changed as 
a result of the withdrawal ofl,500 
people. To maintain the current 
Inter-Collegiate Athletics budget 

of $1.4 million, the total amount 
of the referendum has been 
increased to $28.25. It was $26.50 
previously. The referendum will 
provide some $1.4 million per 
year for ICA. 

Of the $28.25, $26.70 will go 
to lCA. Twenty cents will go to 
spirit organizations such as the 
pep band and the cheerleaders -
a change made to the referendum 
by the Internal committee and 
approved by the A.S. Council. 
The:. remaining money will go to 
sports clubs and recreation clubs. 

Voting on the referendum will 
occur during the A.S. Council 
general elections, second week of 
spring quarter. Undergraduates 
can vote via StudentLink.

Salsman said she objected to the

chair about conduct of vice president internal

Making nice: Jenn Brown Oeft) addresses 
the AS. Council with Nick Lieberknecht 
(right) by her side at Wednesday's meeting. 

By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

TIle A.S. Council held a sel-
dom-used council caucus 
Wednesday night sparked by e-
mailed accusations of misconduct 
of the Vice President Internal 
Jenn Brown by Senate Chair Nick 
Lieberknecht. 

In an e-mail that went out to 
the council early Tuesday morn-
ing, Lieberknecht brought allega-
tions against Brown. One of his 
concerns, he said, would be 
"grounds for impeachment" 
pending an explanation. 

Following negotiations 
between Lieberknecht and 
Brown, the caucus agenda was 
changed to address concerns 
about how council meetings are 
conducted. 

For a substantitive part of the 
three-and-a-half hour council 
meeting, Lieberknecht and 

Brown led a discussion focu ed on 
the members' opinions of the 
proper conduct of meetings. 

The main concern addressed 
was the lack of adherence to the 
rules of parliamentary procedure, 
and how to best enforce them. 

The council, in an informal 
poll, overwhelmingly favored 
finding some sort of parliamentar-
ian to either lead or advise the vice 
president internal in leading the 
meetings. 

The position of parliamentari-
an is currently in the constitution, 
but Brown said she has not been 
able to find anyone interested in 
and qualified for the position. 

Issues of personal behavior and 
treatment of the public during 
meetings were also addressed. 

The caucus concluded with 
Lieberknccht's announcem ent 
that he wishes to work with other

UCSD catches the apathy bug, 
few students turn out to vote 
On -campus polls located at Price Center, Muir college 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Yesterday'S primary election saw 
San Diegans narrowly defeat a pro-
posed beach alcohol ban, the rise of 
a novice politician, and the lowest 
voter turnout in years. 

UCSD residents had the oppor-
tunity to vote for local and state 
issues at one of two on-campus 
polling centers. The polls were 
placed in the Price Center 
Ballroom and at John Muir College 
in the Half Dome Lounge. 

Polls opened at 7 a.m. and 
remained open until 8 p.m. Pollsters 

, reported the turnout was low. 
Gene Olson, poll inspector at 

the Muir college site, remarked, 
"The turnout is quite sparse. We're 
here until eight, so hopefully it will 
pick up." 

It did not. 
Preliminary data from the San 

Diego County Registar of Voters 

INSIDE ... 

shows UCSD resident turnout was 
indeed low. Because overall turnout 
data has yet to be compiled, the 
results are not official. 

If the turnout for Proposition 
G, the beach alcohol ban, at the 
two UCSD polling places can be 
applied to the overall turnout on 
campus, then 6.6 percent of regis-
tered UCSD residents voted. 

According to the Registar of 
Voters, 94 on-campus votes were cast 
in the Proposition G contest. There 
are 1,412 voters registered to cast 
balJots at on-campus polling sites. 

The 1,412 figure may be mis-
leading, however, because of absen-
tee ballots and former residents 
who remain registered on campus 
from the 2000 presidential election. 

Poll inspector Edward 
Washburn from the Price Center 
Ballroom polling place concurred. 

"It hasn't been that busy," he said.

Voting: 
Some students loathed 
the political ad campaigns 
Continued from page 1 

The low rurnout at UCSD was mir-
rored at the state level. This election 
was the second-lowest in California 
primary history, beating only the 1994 
primary when then-governor Pete 
Wilson was up for re-election. 

Srudents say they had their reasons 
for not voting. 

"I didn't vote because when I was 
trying to make an informed decision, it 
ended up being toO time-consuming," 
sa id Revelle senior Karina Corbett. 
"\¥hen it became time to vote, it was 
too late." 

Marshall senior Julia Rotino found 
the ad campaign of Republican victor 
Bill Simon repulsive. 

"The reason I didn't vote is because 
every time I see the name Bill Simon, [ 
begin vomiting illlcontrollably," Rotino 
said. "I didn't think the people at the 
polling place would appreciate having to 
clean up after my regurgitated dinner." 

Nevertheless, those who did vote 
on campus appeared enthusiastic 
about voting and the process itself. 
Muir College Council Chair, junior 
Elizabeth Erwin, remarked on her 
investment in voting. 

"I think it is part of being a citizen," 
Erwin said. "I may not care about 
everything we are voting on, but [ 
should still be informed on it." 

Roosevelt senior Laura Ginn also 
expressed her belief in the importance 
of voting. 

"The presidential electi6n proves 
that every vote counts," Ginn said. " If 
you don't vote, you have no room to 
complain." 

Propo ition G would have placed 
an around-the-clock ban on alcohol 
consumption at selected beaches in 
those areas. The ban was defeated by a 
mere 1,117 vOles; 78,338 to 74,220. 

Many srudents opposed Proposition 
G, seeing it as unnecessary or an 
infringement upon personal liberty. 

Erwin remarked on her desire for 
autOnomy. 

"I'm 21 now, so I want the right to 
drink where I please," she said. 

Colleen Shannon, an employee of 
the San Diego Super Computer 
Center, shared a similar sentiment. 

"There are ilws against being drunk 
in public and against harassing other 
people," she said. "I don't think it is 
necessary to further restrict people. I 
have never drank at the beach, but if I 
wanted to I would want to be able to." 

Poll workers noted that many stu-
dents voted on the nonpartisan ballot. 

"There are a lot of nonpartisans," 
aid Poll Inspector Edward Washburn. 

"This is nice for this election because 
you can vote for any governor candi-
date you want." 

Washburn's wife Elizabeth, the 
assistant poll inspector at the Price 
Center, remarked on the fine decorum 
of UCSD voters. 

"Most students that voted were 
well-prepared with their books already 
marked," Elizabeth said. 

Simon was the big wirUler in the 
Republican primary for governor, 
defeating prominent opponent Richard 
Riordan with nearly 50 percent of the 
vore. Simon will take on Democratic 
incumbent Gov. Gray Davis, who 
walked away wi th his party's nomina-
tion in November's general election. 

Proposition 42 passed easily. The 
measure will all ocate funds from gas 
taxes over d,e next five years toward 
repairing roads and improving mass-
transit ~tems and infrastfUcrure. 

Other passing propositions includ-
ed 40, which allocated billions in 
bonds to protect parks and clean the 
ocean. Proposition 41 , which frees up 
funds for the purchase of new 
machines for state-of-the-art count-
ing of votes, also passed . 

Propo~ition 43, which amends the 
state constitution to have one's vote 
counted, passed, as did Proposition 44, 
which restricts the practice of chiro-
practors who haw committed crimes, 
including insurance fraud. 

The only statewide proposition 
that did not pass was 45, which would 
have given voters the right to petition 
to extend term limit for tate senators 
and As embly member .

BRIEFLY 
JSOE to house education program for research 

The Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research 
Center has announced that its education program 
will operate out of the Jacobs School of Engineering 
at UCSD. Scott Ashford, an assistant professor of 
geotechnical engineering, has been named as the 
director of P.E.E.R:s education program. 

P.E.E.R is a partnership between nine West Coast 
universities that primari~ researches the engineering 
methods used to protect structures and land from 
earthquake damage. Since establishing its education 
committee in 199B, P.E.E.R. has offered research 
opportunities to undergraduate students from the 
participating universities. 

The National Science Foundation annually grants 
$300,000 to P.E.E.R:s education committee, which 
in turn has set up internships for qualified students. 
Another P.E.E.R. program is the "Earthquake 
Engineering Scholars Course," where 30 students 
from affiliated universities visit different campuses 
over four weekends for a crash course in earthquake 
engineering. The education committee also disclos-
es new developments in earthquake engineering to 
middle-school science teachers so they can use 
such information in their curricula. 

UCSD to hold conference on 
Africa's changing politics 

A conference assessing the transitions of democ-
racy, state formation and identity in modern Africa 
will be held March B. The event IS scheduled to run 
from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Santa Cruz-San 
Francisco room of the Price Center. 

The conference will examine the political control 
and the post-<:olonial building of African states that 
have led to political and economic crisis. Speakers from 
UCSD and several other universities will be on- hand to 
discuss the shift from authoritarian to democratic polit-
ical systems over the last decade, emphasizing how 
violence, communications, human rights and globaliza-
tion efforts have changed during this period. 

In particular, the nations of Botswana, Congo, 
Rwanda, Senegal and South Africa will be considered 
as case studies. 

UCSD's African and African·American Studies 
Research Project and the newly established Institute 
for International, Comparative and Area Studies 
sponsor the conference. Admission to the event is 
free and open to the public.

Study claims problems with 
sweaty palms are genetic 

UCLA scientists have presented strong evidence 
that hyperhidrosis, the condition commonly known 
as "swear.r palms" syndrome, is a ~enetic disorder 
that has gone largely unreported In the medical 
world. 

According to Samuel S. Ahn, the principal 
researcher and a professor of vascular surgery at 
UCLA, a dominant gene may cause the condition. 
Ahn said, the medical communir.r generally believed 
the syndrome to be stress-related. 

The study suggests that as much as 5 percent of 
the population may suffer from excessive sweating 
from the hands and feet - more than the 1 percent 
proposed by some older studies. 

The UCLA report also recognizes that swear.r 
palms play a significant role in daily life and 
careers. Examples stated that exceptionally swear.r 
hands could impair a banker from handling 
money or a police officer from handling a gun cor-
rectly. The study also suggests that the rates for 
genetic inheritance of the syndrome from a 
hyperhidrosis sufferer to its offspring are high -
between 28 and 50 percent depending on the sit· 
uation . 

Funding for the research came from the 
california Vascular Research Foundation. The full text 
of the study can be found in the February issue of 
the Journal of Voscular Surgery.

CaIPIRCi: ' 
Student org is hoping to 
change LaSuer's vote 
Continued from page 1 
vote on the issue. 

Senate Bill 532, also known as 
the Clean Energy Bill, would dou-
ble the percentage of renewable 
resources the state's electrical cor-
porations would be required to use 
by 20 I 0 from IOta 20 percent. 

CalPlRG provided students 
with scripts to read that concisely 
covered why the group was urging 
them to call. 

Swdents who did participate felt 
the event was a positive one. 

"I think it's a good idea, and 
something needs to be done about 
the energy crisis," said stlldent Sara 
Panon. 

The tactic of inundating gov-
ernment officials with telephone 
calls has been effective in the past, 
according to CalPIRG organizers. 

"UC Santa Barbara 's CalPIRG 
was able to get their loca l 
Assemblyman to say yes to a bill 
after only an hour of phone calls," 
said CalPlRG member Chris 
Noddings. 

Barry Jantz, district chief of staff 
for Assemblyman LaSuer, said the 
calls will be taken into account but 
the language in the final bill is what 
will be the overriding factor when 
LuSuer votes. 

Nevertheless, students believe 
in the the effectiveness of the tactic. 

"Government is sensitive to mail 
right now; calls are easier," said stu-
dent Sharlene Weng. "It shows 
them that people on campus actual-
ly care. It really makes a difference." 

LaSuer's office logs the calls in 
relation to the issues and bills to 
gauge public support, but it also 
nOtes coordinated efforts by 
groups, Jantz said. 

The energy issue itself is a major 
concern for many srudents as well . 

"I'm particularly interested in the 
energy topic because for our genera-
tion and ti,e generation to come, the 
issue of renewable resources will be 
so importam," said CalPIRG mem-
ber Cassie Burdyshaw. 

"We would like to see these 
renewable resources include wind, 
solar and geothermal," oddings 
said. 

Currendy, the bill is in cOl1unittee 
and has not reached the Senate floor. 
The last vote in September failed; 11 
of the Utilities and Commerce 
Committec members voted: seven in 
favor and four against. Seven mem-
bers abstained from the vote, includ-
ing Assemblyman La Suer. 

CalPIRG hopes to swing 
LaSuer's vote because he has been 
supportive of renewable energy bills 
in the past. 

"We think d,at if it came to the 
floor, people would support it 
because it is good for California, for 
the economy and the environment. It 
would bring jobs to California," said 
CalPIRG member Chris Draper. 

The bill, CalPIRG members 
believe, would also be good for the 
health of Californians. 

Jantz said he expects the bill to 
go back to committee to be revised 
and amended once the bill is final-
iz.ed, and LaSuer will take a stance 
on it, but now it is too early in the 
process for that to happen. 

"I hope we can get 
Assemblyman LaSuer to not only 
protect the environment but also 
the health of all Californians by 
saying he will vote 'yes' on Senate 
Bill 532," Noddings said . 

CalPIRG hopes that events such 
as these will increase student par-
ticipation in the political process. 

"I think students definitely have 
a VOice; they just need to use it," 
Draper said. "That's why we are 
here ." 

Overall, Nodding calls ti,e day a 
"great success" as CaIP[RG beat its 
goal of 75 calls by 3 p.m.; at that 
time they had logged 105 calls.

referendum because no graduate 
srudent was included on the task 
force that developed it. 

She said that the GSA represen-
tative was included later, as an after-
dlOught, and did not have a vote. 

Salsman also said that "an all-
campus election doesn't allow 
graduate srudems a voice" because 
there arc only 3,500 compared to 
) 8,000 undergraduates. 

Council:

There was no discussion of 
Brown's behavior speci fically. 

"This i a discussion that is long, 
long, long overdue," said Marshall 
College Chair Adam Sharki. 

Lieberknechts e-mail was titled: 
"Counci l Caucus: Senate the Office 
of d,e Vice President Internal." It 
addressed three complaints against 
the Office of the Vice President 
Internal : the handling of the 
recently added Senate office space, 
the unprofessional legislative meet-
ings and the questionable appoint-
ment of a conuni nee representa tive 
on the part of Brown. 

Brown and Lieberknecht con-
versed late Tuesday and early 
Wednesday and worked out solu-
tions and explanations over the 
first and third items addressed in 
the e-mail. 

After his addressing of con-
cerns over the office, "it resurrect-
ed as a big priority in [Brown's] 

The GSA suggested that two 
separate elections be held, but 
A.S. Commissioner of Athletics 
Robin Shelton decided to go 
ahead with the referendum with-
out the graduate students because 
of the timeliness of the issue. 

Sal man stressed that gradu~te 
srudents sti ll want to be involved 
in intercollegiate athletics . 

"I'm not saying that graduate 
students aren 't interested in 
sports," she said. "We are sti ll 
talking to Idle A.S . Council] about 
how this will affect graduate-stu-
dent involvement in athletics in 
the future ." 

The athletics budget face mas-

The issue of the improper 

appointment was addressed in d,e 
conversation and Lieberknecht said 
he no longer considers it an issue. 

The caucus addressed d,e sec-
ond concern brought tip by 
Lieberknecht. 

Warren junior senator Lauren 
Lee stressed that having a parlia-
mentarian would be beneficial to 
the council when it comes to main-
taining a bias-free environment. 

She said believes that someone 
who can introduce legislation 
should not be allowed to chair the 
meeting. 

Members of counci l expressed 
concerns over the wa y d,C ca ucus 
was reached. 

"Willie I think this [discussionJ 
is good, I don't necessarily like the 
way we arrived here," said Vice 
President External Dylan deKervor. 

Lieberknecht said there was a 
reason for the way he addressed 
his concerns. 

"If I just talked to Jenn

know that [the concerns] were 
being addressed," he said.

Alcohol law 
merits revision 

If you do the crime, then you should be 
willing to do the time. That was the mes-
sage sent to underage people attempting to 
huy ,'dcohul via a recent settlement 
between :1 University or New I-bmp hire 
' (Ulknt Jnd :1 l'Je\\ Hampshi re store owner 
- <l lld it has set a precedent for store own-
ers. 

Durham , T.H. Marketplace owner 
Chuck Cressy ,lttempted to sue 19-year-
old Jeremy Reney in a New Hamp hire 
Superior Court because Reney used his 
brother's ID to purchase alcohol from 
Cressy's store. Cressy was fined $250 for 
selling alcohol to a minor. He then tried to 
recover $12,000 from Reney in a civil suit, 
an amount equal to the total he spends 
annually on deterring underage alcohol 
sa les. The matter was settled out of court, 
but it does set a precedent for store owners 
to sue underage people who buy alcohol 
from them, 

The Guardian agrees with the principle 
that if a minor attempts to buy alcohol, 
then he is willingly breaking the law and 
should be punished for it. There is, how-
ever, one problem that we have with a 
store owner's right to sue underage pur-
cha ers of alcohol: We feel that the mini-
mum state standards of checking IDs are 
not enough and invite abuse on the part of 
store owners. 

Store owners who simply look at a dri-
ver's license should not be rewarded for 
their laziness - or greed - by a court set-
tlement. We feel that the minimum stan-
dards should be raised by states to require 
license-scanning equipment to verify valid 
driver's licenses. 

If a store has satisfied increased state 
standards for checking identification, then 
we feel that there should be legal recourse 
for a store that is stuck with a fine that can 
range from $100 to $500 and could include 
a suspension of the store's liquor license 
for one to 10 days. Such burdens should 
not rest squarely on the shoulders of store 
owners if they did make an effort to check 
the ID and scan it. 

Underage purchasers of alcohol know 
that they are breaking the law when they 
attempt to buy it from stores. Some go to 
great lengths to deceive cashiers, many 
with great success, It should not be the 
burden of the store owner to keep up with 
all of the tricks and technological advances 
of underage purchasers of alcohol, as long 
as they follow the preferably higher stan-
dards of the law on identification checks. 

We feel that tllis is a good precedent 
that allows liquor-selling busine ses to 
have their day in court with those who 
willingly commit the crime, but we do 
warn that stricter minimum standards for 
J.D.-checking are needed to keep store 
owner from abusing this precedent.

Digging for trouble: why Alaska's 
pipeline will not solve oil woes 

Impractical solution to America's energy crisis 
is also frought with security problems 

By ANDREW QUADRI 
Senior Staff Writer 

President George W. Bush needs to 
stop considering oil drilling in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge. You don't have 
to be an environmentalist to feel that 
way, either. 

Drilling in ANWR, according to its 
proponents, would supposedly fix our 
dependency on volatile imponed oil mar-
kets, especially those in the Midclle East. 
Superficially, it looks like a gre2t de2l: By 
increasing domestic oil production, we 
reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
Unfonunately, it isn't quite that simple. 

You may already know that less than a 
year's worth of oil lies in ANWR, and 
that the lower 48 states would not see 
any of it for at least 10 years. There are 
some endangered animals that a few peo-
ple care about, too, I understand. Those 
facts aren't terribly impottant because 
those facts alone won't stop the push for 
drilling. 

Remember that the oil is in northern 
Alaska. Oil coming out of Alaska is 
shipped through Valdez, which is in 
southern Alaska, where the ocean isn't 
blocked with ice all year. As a result, it 
must be transported through the Alyeska 
Pipeline Service Company's SOO-mile-
long Trans Alaska Pipeline, which carries 
17 percent of domestic oil production at 
present. 

Most of the pipeline is above ground 
- read "vulnerable" - and during win-
ter, it's difficult to access or repair, 
according to Alyeska . 

Alyeska spokesman Tim Woolston 
said that it is "a monumental task to pro-
tect every inch of that pipeline 24 hours 
a day." 

The U.S. Army proved that it's more 
than "a monumental task" to defend the 
pipeline: It's impossible, A 1975 Los 
Angeles Timts story reported that the 
Army concluded that it was "impossible 
to prevent determined aboteurs from 

shutting down TAPS for a year or more." 
Not much has changed since then . 
What's worse, yol,l don't even have to 

be a deternuned saboteur to shut down 
the pipeline - just drunk. A drunken 
AJaska resident, Daniel Lewis, punctured 
it with one shot from his OJ 3 8-caliber 
rifle. Hundreds of thousands of gallons 
of oil leaked and the pipeline was sh ut off 
for two-and-a-half days. 

The loss: $60 mi llion in delayed oil 
shipments alone. The scary part: This 
mishap occurred afur the Sept. I I ter-
rorist anacks, on Oct. 4,2001. 

AJaska Gov. Tony Knowles, who 
strongly supports North Slope oil devel-
opment, said: "Clearly, the fact that one 

We can eliminate the need 
to import Middle Eastern 

oil by improving energy 
efficiency at home and on 

the road. That means 
buying energy-efficient 

applicances, driving cars 
that are more fuel-efficient, 

and driving less, p~rio~t 

person with a rifle can do this much dam-
age is a point of concern in terms of vul-
nerability." Clearly, he is a master of 
understatement. 

Essentially, the Trans Alaska Pipeline 
is a vital part of our economy and 
because it is one big, impossible- to-
defend pipe, it is the biggest and easiest 
terrorist target in the country. 

So our government thinks that we 
hould reduce our diversified foreign oil 

dependency by shifting it to a central-
ized, decaying and vulnerable piece of 
domestic infrasuucrure? That doesn't 
make any sense to me. 

Only 22 percent of imported oil 

comes from the volati le Middle East; we 
import most of the rest from safer 
sources in the Western Hemisphere. If 
we want to red uce dependence on 
Middle Eastern oil, that's great. I'm 
against importing $500 million worth of 
"evil" Iraqi oil every year as much as the 
next guy. But let's eliminate that depen-
dency in a way that makes sense. 

We can eliminate the need to import 
Middle Eastern oil by improving energy 
efficiency at home and on the road . That 
means buying energy-efficient appli-
ances, driving cars that are more fuel-effi-
cient, and driving less, period. EPA 
reports indicate that improving nation-
wide automotive fuel economy by three 
miles per gallon is all it would take to 
make imported Middle Eastern oil a relic. 

What does this mean? Quit buying 
gas-guzzling vehicles and quit driving 
them alone everywhere. No one can 
force you to quit, but you should remem-
ber that your private decisions h ave pub-
lic consequences. If you ain't be both-
ered to get out of your car and walk or 
bicycle once in a while - to make some 
changes in your life - you are part of the 
reason we have to worry about bastards 
like Saddam Hussein. 

Efficiency is not austerity and I hope 
that lazi ly sitting behind a steering wheel 
isn't your only joy in li fe . You might even 
like the world outside your air. If you aln 
bike when it's practical to do so - say, to 
work or your local supennarket - do it. A 
$20 racle holds two bags of groceries. Get 
one and use it. You'U go to the store more 
often, but you'll save money on gas, exer-
cise your legs, and clear your conscience. 

The day after the terrorist attacks, 
Bush said that "we will not allow this 
enemy to win the war by changing our 
way of life." Not even if it means that we 
must continue being myopic about 
drilling in ANWR and that we must keep 
wasting energy to maintain our ties to 
Middle Eastern tyrant? Give me a 
break.

T he Graduate Student 
Association is holding a fee refer-
endum on StudentLink from 
March 4 to March 15. The refer-
endum seeks to increase the grad 
student activity fee from $8 per 
quarter to $12 per quarter. This 
fee was instated in 1988 and was 
last raised in 1994 to the current 
$8 per quarter. 

Why does the GSA need a fee 
increase? The GSA gets about 
$80,000 a year. The number of 
deparonents and events using 
GSA funds has been increasing. 
Since 1999, we 've spent about 
$92,000 yearly. We used reserve 
funds for the defici t, but these are 
nearly exhausted. Our share of 
vending machine income may 

Why is the GSA over-
budget? Our exposure to the grad-
uate population has increased. 
The attendance at GSA-spon-
sored events has grown faster than 
the grad population. Per our 
financial by-laws, organizers can 
request fundin g from the GSA for 
events that enrich grad srudent 
life. Such funding has been and is 
increasing faster than revenues. 

In 1997 -1998, we gave over 
$21,000 to grad orgs and depart-
ments, with a $78,000 budget. 
Last year, we gave $24,100 of our 
$SO,OOO budget. We want to con-
tinue to meet demands and fund 
organizations or deparnnents that 
come to us with a worthy request. 

The $4 increase will generate 
about $36,000 a year in revenue. 
This will cover the defici t and 
should meet increased demand 
for GSA money for seven years.

Please do not tell me that you are 
planning on spending your entire 
summer after graduation working at 
Wal-Mart. There are much more 
rewarding jobs out there. 

Who cares if you have a degree in 
conununications and have no idea 
what you want to do for the rest of 
your life? Looking into interesting 
occupations is worth it. The pay can 
be better, the location always is, and 
the stories are sure to be passed on 
through generations. 

As a theater major, I have no cl ue 
what I will do after graduation. So, I 
thought, why not work and travel at 
the same time? 

I was looking on the call board in 
the theater deparonent and noticed a 
flyer for Stiletto Entertainment. It 's a 
casting agency fo r singers and 
dancers who work on cruise liners. 

I know this job may not be for 
everyone, thankfully. But this got me 
thinking about other positions that 
might be available on cruise ships. I 
searched online and discovered many 
different positions that need to be 
filled: those of hosts, waiters, bar -
tenders, areas in retail, cooking staff, 
crew and more. 

Although I do not want to be an 
out-of-work actor (a.k.a. waitress) for 
my summer job, after researching 
the pay that these people make on a 
cruise liner, [ am se riously reconsid-
ering. Try $2,000 to $4,000 per 
month for po itions that receive tips. 
Remember, if the passengers have 
enough money to take a cruise, they 
generally have enough money to tip 
well. And regardless of occupation, 
base pay is sti ll $300-$500 a week. 

Ever wish someone would pay 
you to visit the Caribbean, the 
Panama Canal , Mexico, Alaska, 
Europe, Hawaii or South America? 
These are some of the place cruise 
liners sail, which is far better than 
staying in the same town I've lived in 
as far back as I can remember. 

Location is everything. Although 
one might not get as much time 011 
land (this is, after aU, a job), the time 
on shore leave is priceless. Tell me 
about another occupation in which 
someone else pays for your food, 
lodging and travel to places most of 
us would never otherwise see. 

Perhaps the ocean does not quite 
wet one's whistle. There are still 
other opportunities for more inter-
esting and advenrurous occupations 
than one can find at Safeway. For 
example, working as a ranch hand

T here arc coffee shops in every city 
in the world, but the coffee shops of 
San Diego seem to hold a kind of mys-
tery. Tucked ami d th e bustling 
metropolis and concealed in qui et res-
idential areas is an entire hidden world 
Strllng together by coffee beans. Here 
arc ,I few landmarks to ger ) '011 started. 

Lestat's Coffeehouse is interesting 
and quirky. Nestled in a part of 
Normal Heights that is often referred 
to affectionately as Abnormal Heights, 
Lestat's showcases local artworks on 
the walls and the sound of fencing 
classes overhead. This provides a clas-
sic coffeehouse aonosphere, but with a 
twist. The house offers live music daily 
between 8 p.m. and II p.m. in the 
newl y renovated cafe area and an open 
mic on Monday nights. Lestat's is a 
good mix of the liveliness of Crema 
and the coziness of Kensington. It also 
has a wonderful candy selection. 

So, farewell . Happy coffee shop 
visiting. Happy coffee drinking. And 
remember: Friends don't let friends 
go to Starbucks. p/IoIos by Tyler Huff/Guardian

Fever 
Kylie Minogue 
Capitol Records 

*** Remember going to the 
roller rink in third grade 
and \Vai ting for that '80s 
cover of "Locomotion" to 
come on? Thirty-three-
year-old Aussie pop 
princes Kyli e Minogue 
ca n claim responsibility for 
that track, and she has 
returned to American 
shores after a l3-year hia-
tus. The Stateside release 
of Minogue's newest 
album "Fever" de notes her 
attempt to recapture the 
United States and estab-

hiatus 
o S I I S ~ 
www.u csdguardian .org 

lish herself as worthy of 
mononomial nomencla-
ture here. 

All of her albums since 
the late '80s have been 
wildly successful in 
Australia, the United 
Kingdom and elsewhere. 

However, the United 
States, as always, has proven 
the hardest market to crack. 
Capitol Records evidently 
believes that the United 
States, enjoying a climate of 
tentative acceptance for 
dance pop, is ready for 
Minogue at long last. 

The ubiquitous "Can't 
Get You Out of My Head" 
is not all that's served up 
on this release. 

The album is a bearable 
sa mpling of poppy house 
and trance curs, all Kylifi ed 
with the singer's breathy 
vocals and super-sappy 
demeanor. There's the req-
uisite Spanish guitar house 
track, "Your Love," and the 
soaring, trancey "Fragile." 

It's hard to point to any 
one track as filler, when 
most discerni ng ears would 
probably tag the whole 

album as a sampling of pop 
pap, Though it may be this, 
it's sti ll a fun foray into the 
world of Euro-happy house 
and smooth production. 

Indeed, Minogue has a 
track record of working 
with successful producers 
and WTiters. Her other huge 
'80s hit, "I Should Be So 
Lucky," was produced by 
yesteryear heartthrob Rick 
Astley'S production team, 
and the biggest hit from her 
last album, the fri sky 
"Spinning Around," was 
co-penned by none other 
than the great Paula Abdul. 
On "Fever," Minogue res-
urrects '80s diva Cathy 
Denn is for songwriting 
assistance, and Dennis 
lends a hand on three 
tracks, including "Can't 
Get You Out of My Head." 

"Fever" won't win any 
Grammys next year, but 
that's not to say it's unwor-
thy of your attention. Take 
this one to the discoteque, 
though, and not the roller 
rink.

Golf competes at SLO tourney 
Gale shoots a 221 for fifth but team places seventh 
ByANUKUMAR 
Staff Writer 

Playing in its fourth tourna-
ment of the season, the UCSD 
golf team participated in the Cal 
State San Marcos [nvitation al on 
Monday and Tuesday. The event, 
held at San Luis Rey Downs in 
Bonsall, Calif., found the Tritons 
struggling, finishing in seventh 
place in a field of 11 teams. 

Cal State Stanisl aus l ed the 
tournament from the stan, and a 
combined score of 894 gave it first 
place in the invitational. Stanislaus 
was the only team to shoot better 
than 298 in anyone round, and 
the Warriors hit scor es of 294 in 
each of the first two rounds of the 
tournament. 

Grand Canyon Univer sity took 
second place, finishing nine 
strokes behind Stanislaus. Cal 
State San Bernardin o and Point 
Loma Nazarene tied for third 
place with combined scor es of 906 
to round o ut the top fOll r teams. 

The Tritons got off to a bad 
stan in the first two r ounds of the 
event, shooting 3 11 in each of their 
Monday rounds. UCSD managed 
to improve by six strokes on 
Tuesday and finished the tourna-
m ent with a scor e of 927 . 

"Three hundred and el even is 
too high of a score to h ave in any 
tournament," UCSD golf head 
coach Mike Wydra said . 

Individually, the Warriors ' 
Bill Sutt was the only gol fer in 
the entire field to break 70 in the 
tournament. Sutt finished in first 
p lace with an i ndi vidual com· 
bined score of 214, two sh ots 
b etter than Chris Galeski of San 
Diego State. R ounding out the 
top three spots, P oint Lorna's 
J osh Colace finished one stroke 
behind Galeski. 

UCSD junior R yan Gale fin-
ished in a tie for the fifth spot, along 
with Mark Lawless of Stanilalls and 
Ethan Potts of Point Lorna. These 
golfers all shot scor es of 221. 

Gale had scores of70, 74 and 77 

in the tournament. The Tritons' 
top finisher was the only golfer of 
the five UCSD participants to 
break 80 in the first round, and 
Gale was or..e of only two Tritons to 
shoot bener than 80 ' in the second 
round. 

The par-72 course at San Luis 
Rey Downs yielded many high 
scores from the tournament field . 
Golfers struggled on the course, 
which featured tight fairways and 
unique putting greens that caused 
problems for many people on the 
putting surfaces. 

" We had a couple of our regu-
lars struggle on the course and 
found it not to their lilcing," Wydra 
said. 

The Tritons will next take part 
in the Cal State San Bernardino 
Invitational on March II and 
March 12. Wydra and his team will 
use the event to prepare for the 
Southern California Intercollegiare 
Championship, which will be held 
March 13 and March 14 at the Auld 
Course in Chula Vista.

Back East ballies put up meager fight 
Men's tennis dispatches Boston College with little ado 
By STEPHANIE MORIARTY 
Staff Writer 

UCSD 's solid 9-0 sweep 
against Division I Boston College 
0 11 M onday continued its excellent 
rea r and boosted the Tritons' 
record to an unprecedented 10-0. 

T he beginning doubles tandem 
ofSameer Chopra and Bryan Swatt 
boosted the spirits of the Tritons 
because they were down two 
breaks at 4-6 and came back to win 
the pro set in a tiebreaker 9-8. 

UCSD 's Jeff Wilson and 
Everert Schroeter stomped on BC's 

o. 2 team of Chris McCoy and 
Marc Lucero, beating them 8-0. 

The Tritons' No. 3 doubles 
team of Dan Albrecht and Sean 
Nagel secured the doubles sweep 
for UCSD with its 8-4 victory over 
the Eagles' duo of Ross Pytko and 
Paul Colahan. 

For the most part, the Tritons 
also dominated the singles match-
es, but Chopra's singles match was 
a true tennis battle. _ 

Chopra remained mentally 
tough and pulled out the first set 
7-6, winning the tiebreaker and 
continuing his strong play to pick 
up the win in straight sets against 
BC's No. 1 Justin Slattery. 

The No. 2 spot, occupied by 

Swart, also won in straight sets (6-
3, 6-3) like the rest of the Triton 
squad. 

No. 3 player Wilson and No. 4 
Blake Wilson-Hayden, both 
sophomores, sealed 6-1, 6-4 victo-
ries by playing strong yet com-
posed tennis. 

Emil Novak and Schroeter, in 
the No.5 and No. 6 singles posi-
tions, also showed the Eagles what 
UCSD tennis is made of, securing 
6-2, 6-1 and 6- 1, 6-1. Both were 
commanding wins that aided the 
9-0 overall victory. 

Head coach Eric Steidlmayer 
was thrilled with his team, espe-
cially the efforts of Chopra and 
Swart in both singles and doubles; 
not to mention the rest of the team 
stepping up to a Division I squad 
and sending the opponent back to 
Boston with a huge bagel. 

"I think that today showed how 
much we have improved since last 
year and how we are improving 
this season," Steidl mayer said. 
"The individuals I look to are 
Bryan Swart and Sameer Chopra. 
Bryan would not have been able to 
win that doubles match three 
months ago. He has really pro-
gressed in his mental abilities." 

Steidlmayer was just as pleased 
with his No. 1 player. 

Four fencers foil the 
opposition on their 
way to nationals 
UCSD swashbucklers place 
second in combined standings 
By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

Exceeding all expectations and 
asserting itself as a force to be 
reckoned with, the UCSD fenc-
ing team qualified four individu-
als to the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association national 
championships. 

The team placed second overall 
in the men's and women's com-
bined standings, right be~een tra-
ditional regional powers-Air Force 
and Stanford. 

The women were second 
overall and will send three fencers 
to the NCAA national champi-
onships in Madison, N.j., from 
March 21 through March 24. Of 
the three fencing weapons - foil, 
epee and sabre, the Triton 
women will be represented in 
two, with Raelyn Jacobson and 
Josephine Roberts going in the 
epee division and Keeley Vega 
competing in foil. 

The men's team will send 
senior captain Andrew Anfora in 
the sabre division. 

Anfora came to the sport only 
fOllr years ago, but head coach 
Stuart Lee says It's good to see 
homegrown talent succeed. 

"Andrew was the big surprise 
for me," Lee said . "He's really 
fenced well for me, and it has sur-
prised everyone how he's grown 
as a fencer." 

With a complicated qualifica-

tion process that involves a com-
bination of strength of schedule, 
placement at regionals and poli-
tics within the sport, even some 
Triton athletes who can make a 
strong case for qualifying did not 
make the cut. 

Senior Wesley Bellanca won 
the men's foil division but his low 
initial seeding prevented him 
from qualifying for the national 
championships. 

Christine Megowan placed 
third in the Epee division 
between two of her teammates 
but also fell short. 

With the largest group of 
UCSD qualifiers ever and a 
strong group of nonqualifiers, 
Anfora notices that the Tritons 
are gaining recognition. 

"We're starting to make waves 
at the regional level," he said. "In 
the four years I've been on the 
team, we've gone from being rela-
tively a joke to a solid cohesive 
team." 

Expectations vary while the 
Triton fencers head to New 
Jersey, but it's clear that they view 
this as an opportunity. 

Vega said, "My only expecta-
tion is that it will be a great 
opportunity to fence some very 
strong fencers." 

Indeed, like they have been all 
season, the Triton fencers will 
look to exceed expectations in 
New Jersey and put UCSD on 
the national fencing map. 

Guardian file photo 

Men's tennis: Mike Meyers rips a forehand earlier in the season and even with 
his eyes closed has helped the Tritons to a rousing 10.Q start. 

"The same can be said for 
Chopra," he said. "Last year, he 
wouldn't have won the match that 
he won in singles today. He won 
on pure guts today, pure and sim-
ple. He played with less than his 
best and sti ll fought extremely 
hard to pull out the win: 

The positive momentum of the 
Tritons should help them in their 
matches this weekend against the 

Division ill Redlands, a top team 
in its division. 

The Tritons will also face Cal 
Poly Pomona, ranked No. 21 
nationally, a tough team that they 
have had trouble with in the past. 
Both matches are away, and it 
won't be until April 5 when the 

sq~d is at home again playing a 
match against Gustavus Adolphus 
College. 

Trip North a suc~ess 
for Dao and company 
Women's tennis picks up two 
victories in the CIty by the bay 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team continued its dominance 
on the West Coast with a suc-
cessful road trip to San 
Francisco last weekend. 

The Tritons opened their trip 
with a 4-3 victory over Division 
I University of San Francisco on 
Saturday afternoon. 

Playing under the Division I 
scoring system, in which the 
three doubles matches count as 
only one point, the Tritons took 
the lead with doubles victorie~ 
from the No. 1 team of Lyndsey 
Tadlock and Julie Westerman (8-
6) and No. 3 team Jasmin Dao 
and Kristina Jansen (8-3). 

Dao and Jansen improved to 
9-0 on the season, the only unde-
feated Triton doubles pairing. 

In singles action, Jansen, 
Westerman and Tadlock each 
remained undefeated on the sea-
son, picking up straight-set vic-
tories. 

Dao, playing in the tough 
No. 1 singles spot, dropped her 
sixth match of the season but 
played even with USF's Gabriela 
Ruiz. 

The next day, the Tritons 
headed across town to face 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association foe San Francisco 
State. The Tritons dominated 
the much weaker Gators, pick-
ing up an easy 9-0 victory. 

Jansen set the pace for 
UCSD, teaming up with Dao at 

No.3 doubles for an 8-0 victory. 
Jansen then swept USF's Tiffany 
Leslie 6-0, 6-0 at No. 5 singles. 

Those victories were the 
third time this season Jansen did 
not drop a game in both of her 
singles and double matches. 

Mary Hung kept up with 
Jansen with a 6-0, 6-0 sweep at 
No.4 singles. O-Neil (7-5, 6-1), 
Tadlock (6-1, 6-1) and 
Westerman (6-2, 6-0) each 
picked up relatively easy victo-
ries. 

More importantly, however, 
Dao picked up her third singles 
victory of the season, defeating 
Amanda Wilson, the only player 
for SFSV with a winning record, 
6-1, 6-1 at No. 1 singles. Dao, 
the lone freshman who sees reg-
ular time, now has a record of 3-
6 at No.1 singles. 

VCSD moved up to the 
eighth spot in the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association rankings, but 
recent losses by No. 6 Abilene 
Christian University and No. 7 
Rollins College have given the 
Tritons the opportunity to move 
up when new rankings come out 
in two weeks. 

The Tritons move to 10-0 on 
the season and lead the CCM. 
Six of their wins have been over 
CCM opponents. 

VCSD returns to action 
against Beloit College March 9 
at UCSD's North Courts at 10 
a.m. The Division III 
Buccaneers feature AlI-
Americans Julia Lebedeva and

two road dual-meets last weekend, 
taking on UC Irvine Saturday 
morning, then traveling the other 
direction to compete again t Long 
Beach State the following day. 

The Tritons, traditionally a late-
blooming team, viewed their Irvine 
match Saturday as an early chance 
to see where the team stands against 
the better-prepared Anteaters, 
who came into Saturday's race with 
three February scrimmages already 
under their belts. 

In the five-race event, UCSD 
managed to hold its own against 
VCI, winning the junior varsity eight 
event as well as the novice four race. 

Sophomore Stefanie Barriere, 
competing for the first time at 
stroke, led the Tritons' varsity eight 
to a second place finish against the 
Anteaters, ending with a time of 
7: 18.0 to UCl's 7:07.1. 

Head coach Patti Pinkerton was 
pleased with her varsity team's 
pefonnance. 

"We were 11 seconds behind 
them. That's the closest we 've been 
in three years," she said. "We lost, 
but I felt that we were well ahead of 
where we want to be." 

The UCSD junior varsity eight 
one-upped the varsity team by beat-
ing their Anteater counterparts, 
posting a time of 7:42.2 - good 
enough for a seven-second victory. 

Paced by the leadership of 
sophomore Elizabeth Jones, the 
Tritons came from behind to take 
the race by a comfortable margin of 
two-and-one-half boat lengths. 

The Triton novice four boat 
picked up the second win of the 
day for UCSD, coming in less 
than five seconds ahead of the 
Irvine team with a time of 9:29.8. 
The boat was stroked by Michelk 
Pitsley, who led the young team in 
what was the racing debut for 
most of them. 

The next day in Long Beach 
Calif. the Tritons ran into a snarl as 
the organization of the meet fell 
apart and forced the teams push up 
the race times and be out of the 
water by 8 a.m. 

"The head coach at Long Beach 
wasn't a terrific organizer," 
Pinkerton said. "Because he didn't 
book the stadium, we had to be off 
by 8 so the races got moved up 20 
minutes. It's a long way to travel 
and not get fair results." 

The Tritons experimented with 
their boat lineups and suffered 
from it, as the varsity eight lost by' 
five boatlengths to the '4gers. 

"I tried changing the lineup, and 
it didn't work," Pinkerton said. 
"There was just no magic in the 
boat." 

Despite the encouraging results 
last weekend, the women's crew 
team still has a ways to go before 
getting to mid-season form. 

"We are not at race-pace yet; 
there's a few tactical things we need 
to tighten up," Pinkerton said.
