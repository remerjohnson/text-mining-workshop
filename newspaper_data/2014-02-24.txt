VOLUME 47, ISSUE 35  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2014 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

UCSD Health System became 
the first in the nation to use a device 
that improves surgical precision and 
accuracy. This FDA-approved iAS-
SIST device, designed by Zimmer 
Holdings, Inc., enables the surgeon 
to verify each surgical step, reduc-
ing mechanical errors during com-
plete knee replacements.

Approximately 600,000 total 
knee replacement procedures are 
performed in the United States 
every year. Knee surgeries require 
precise alignment in the knee, and 
the iASSIST computer navigation 
system is meant to improve surgical 
precision and accuracy, which will 
also effectively reduce the need for 

revision surgery.
Dr. Francis Gonzalez, a member 

of the Department of Orthopedic 
Surgery, believes the new surgery 
will benefit patients.

“This device enables orthope-
dic surgeons to restore a patient’s 
normal alignment with precision in 
a reproducible fashion, decreasing 
revision surgery and providing a 
more natural feel of the implant for 
the patient,” Gonzalez said to UCSD 
News.

Total knee replacement surgery 
has a higher failure rate when the 
knee is misaligned, according to 
Gonzales. The iASSIST program 
will decrease the failure rate and 
improve efficiency, as aging popula-
tion may require more surgeries.

Current robotic and computer-
assisted systems are far less efficient 
and require a large computer monitor 
in the operating room. However, this 
new device is only two inches wide 
and is the only thing needed to aid 
surgeons during knee replacement 
surgery.

“The iASSIST system allows us to 
bypass additional imaging and still 
get a patient-specific knee,” Gonzalez 
said. “This technology is quite intui-
tive and adds accuracy and precision 
to our instruments, giving us the abil-
ity to restore mechanical alignment 
with all patients regardless of their 
deformity.”

Diana Mertrude, a retired nurse, 

UCSD and the UC Board of Regents have finalized plans to replace the Nimitz Marine 
Facility wharf at the Point Loma pen-
insula, a project set to cost $25 million.

The UCSD Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography uses the nearly six-acre 
compound as the home base for four 
of its research vessels, capable of per-
forming a wide range of administra-
tive, technical and maintenance tasks. 
The Nimitz Marine Facility also hosts 
visiting ships from science institu-
tions around the country as time and 
space permits, as well as the U.S. Navy’s 
Floating Instrument Platform, a manned 
spar buoy designed for oceanographic 
research. According to Scripps, the fin-
ger pier is 110 meters long while the quay 

wall is 85 meters long and can service up 
to seven vessels at a time.

However, the pier has seriously dete-
riorated with age. At the current rate, 
heavy machinery and trucks will no lon-
ger be able to safely operate on the struc-
ture, as it can only support 20 percent of 
its original weight capacity. The Nimitz 
Marine Facility must resort to hiring 
shore-based cranes with a longer reach 
to load equipment and supplies onto the 
ocean-going vessels. 

“I was on the job for maybe six 
months at the time, and I decided to take 
a walk underneath the pier [...] and I 
was shocked,” Scripps Associate Director 
Bruce Appelgate said. “The facility was 

According to the U.S. 
Department of Education, 74 per-
cent more California students are 
filing for federal financial aid this 
year through the Free Application 
for Federal Student Aid.

For the 2013–14 school year, 
around 60 percent of undergradu-
ates at UCSD receive need-based 
financial aid. Another 45 percent 
receive Federal Pell Grants for low-
income families.

Many four-year colleges are 
offering more grants and scholar-
ships to students to help offset the 
costs of rising tuition fees for higher 
education.

UC Davis established the Aggie 
Grant Plan that is geared towards 
helping families with incomes 
within $80,000 to $120,000. At UC 
Berkeley, families with earnings of 
up to $140,000 are now eligible for 
financial aid. Multiple scholarships 
are also offered to entering fresh-
men and continuing undergraduates 
at UCSD as well, that include the 
William Stout scholarship and the 
Alumni Leadership scholarship.

Another initiative known as the 
Middle Class scholarship was pro-
posed by Assembly Speaker John A. 
Perez (D-Los Angeles) of California 
and was signed into effect by Gov. 
Jerry Brown on July 1, 2013. 

The program is going to be 
phased in over the course of the 
next four years, beginning with the 
2014–15 school year.

UCSD Financial Aid Director 
Ann Klein said she encourages 
students to take advantage of the 
Middle Class Scholarship that is 
devoting $170 million to help stu-
dents with tuition fees.

“It’s good news for students and 
families who can now qualify for 
this new scholarship to help pay a 
portion of their UC system wide 
tuition fees,” Klein said. “We antici-
pate this new program will help 
about 3,000 UCSD undergraduate 
students, bringing in approximately 
$3.5 million in financial support 
next year, and it will continue to 
grow while the program is being 
phased in.”

The Middle Class scholar-
ship was established in the hopes 
of making higher education more 
affordable for families with incomes 
within $80,000 to $150,000. 

The amount of aid that each stu-
dent will receive from this program 
is determined by the California 
Student Aid Commission. The 
award will be based on a sliding 
scale, covering from 10 to 39 of a 
student’s tuition fees. It will also 
consider any other publicly funded

BRIEFS BY MEKALA NEELAKANTAN ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITORMERYL PRESS CONTRIBUTING WRITER
▶ SDPD Officer Resigns Amid 

Felony Charges
San Diego police officer 

Christopher Hays resigned from 
his job at the city department last 
Wednesday after being accused and 
charged with multiple felony and 
misdemeanor counts involving false 
imprisonment and sexual battery 
against five women.

According to Hays’s attorney, 
Kerry Armstrong, the former offi-
cer continues to plead not guilty 
on all counts and is expressing dis-
appointment in the police depart-
ment’s methods of investigation into 
the matter.

“He’s not going to resign because he 
did anything wrong,” Armstrong said 
in an interview with NBC San Diego. 
“He’s extremely upset with the police 
department for not backing him in 
this case. It’s really hurt him.”

Hays faces a preliminary trial on 
April 22; he has current court orders 
to stay away from the four women 
alleging his sexual misconduct.

▶RAZA Resource Centro 
Appoints Director

UCSD Alumnus Dr. Gerardo 
Arellano was appointed as the first 
director of the campus Raza Resource 
Centro, a newly created community 
and support center for UCSD Chicano 
and Latino students, on Feb. 11. 

Arellano previously served as a 
department member of American and 
Chicano studies at Cal State Fullerton 
and helped manage the Enhancing 
Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for 
Hispanic Students grant.

Interim Vice Chancellor for Equity, 
Diversity and Inclusion Carol Padden 
announced the decision in a campus-
wide release on Tuesday.

“Gerardo has extensive experience 
advising and collaborating with gradu-
ate and undergraduate student organi-
zations,” Padden said.

▶ Swine Flu Cases Decrease
After a flu season that resulted in 43 

deaths due to the pandemic swine flu 
strain this past year in San Diego, the 

influenza activity is decreasing. The 
cases reported per week have lessened 
from 297 to 196, with the percentage 
of emergency room patients due to 
the flu also dwindling. The flu season 
typically ends in April, but vaccines 
are still offered for the H1N1 strain, 
a H3N1 strain and the influenza B 
strain. Positive means of flu prevention 
include getting vaccinated and simple 
hygiene, such as thorough hand wash-
ing and the use of hand sanitizer.

▶UCSD to Host James Avery 
Memorial

UCSD will host a memorial trib-
ute for James Avery, a UCSD alum-
nus and an actor best known for his 
portrayal as Uncle Phil Banks in the 
television show “The Fresh Prince of 
Bel-Air.” Avery died on Dec. 31, 2013 
due to complications from heart sur-
gery. Avery was a Thurgood Marshall 
College student who graduated in 1976 
with a bachelor’s degree in theater and 
literature. He and his wife Barbara 
Avery, also a UCSD alumna, devel-

oped the James Avery Scholarship to 
support black students studying per-
forming arts at UCSD. The memorial 
will take place on March 1 at 2 p.m. 
at the Mandell Weiss Forum and will 
feature friends of Avery and perform-
ers, including Daphne Maxwell Reid, 
who played Avery’s television wife 
Vivian Banks on “The Fresh Prince 
of Bel-Air.”

CORRECTION
An article in the Feb. 20 issue 
of the Guardian about college 
councils failing amendments to 
the A.S. constitution incorrectly 
stated that Sixth College Student 
Council failed half of the amend-
ments. They actually failed three 
out of seven amendments.

who was one of the first patients at 
UCSD Health System, is an example 
of a successful surgery using this 
new device.

Arthritis is one of the leading 
causes for joint replacement sur-
geries, and the procedure involves 
replacing the damaged joint surfaces 

with metal and plastic implants.
Due to arthritis, Mertrude felt 

pain in her left knee and sought a 
knee replacement. The surgery was 
a success — just three days after sur-
gery, she was discharged and walked 
out of the hospital unaided.

Three months later, according to 
Mertrude, she was able to continue 
her passion for tennis. 

   She went on to have her right 
knee replaced and is looking for-
ward to cross-country motorcycle 
riding with her friends and family 
this spring.

“The surgery truly improved my 
quality of life,” said Mertrude.

grants in the student’s aid package, 
as well.

Following the approval of 
Proposition 30, which raised sales 
and incomes taxes in 2012, tuition 
fees at the CSU and UC systems 
have remained at a flat rate for two 
years. Gov. Brown has asked insti-
tutions to continue the trend for a 
third year.

In addition, the state approved 
of another financial aid application 

known as the Dream Act application 
in 2011 that was implemented last 
year to help undocumented students 
gain access to federal financial aid. 

Officials are pushing to have 
students file for federal financial 
aid this year with the expansion of 
eligibility being made through the 
Middle Class scholarship and the 
Dream Act application.

The California Student 
Opportunity and Access Program 
Consortium is one of many orga-
nizations across the state that is 

hosting “Cash for College” work-
shops to aid families in filling out 
the FAFSA. Cal-SOAP Consortium 
Director Monica Roberts urges the 
importance of filing for federal aid 
this year.

“More people should apply 
because more students potentially 
are going to be eligible this year 
than in the past,” Roberts said in a 
Sacramento Bee article on Feb. 20.

designed to last 40 to 50 years, and we 
had reached the engineering lifespan 
of the structure. There was exposed 
rebar and cracks in some of the sup-
port members. Ever since then, I’ve 
been trying to figure out the extent of 
the damage and what the cheapest way 
to keep operating was.”

Bids from construction firms will 
be selected within the next month, 
with the project expected to proceed 
on April 1. According to a Feb. 16 
Los Angeles Times article, the docks 
will be demolished and rebuilt close 

to its current dimensions — albeit 
slightly higher to account for rising 
sea levels — in about 18 months.  In 
the meantime, Scripps will likely use 
other wharves around San Diego to 
temporarily service its fleet. 

The money for the project comes 
from a variety of sources. About half 
is funded by the UC system and a state 
waterways grant, while the rest comes 
from private agencies, like the Office of 
Naval Research. 

“Our mission is to make it possible 
for scientists to have unencumbered 
access to the sea and to do it safely,” 
Appelgate said. “The [renovations] will 

restore our ability to do what we do 
best. It’s critical that we do this now 
and have a new pier that will last us 
another 50 years.”

The Nimitz Marine Facility assists 
with continual experiments in under-
water acoustics, radar and environ-
mental observation. Since 1905, 
Scripps itself has also hosted a wide 
range of investigative and educational 
programs focused not only on San 
Diego but at research centers around 
the world.

Lack of
Vaccination
a Threat to
Population

With the flu season still going strong in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s 
necessary for people to understand 
the paramount importance of vaccina-
tions and immunization campaigns. 
Winter officially ends mid-March, but 
that does not mean the flu season is 
also nearing completion. According 
to a 31-year study by the U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
45 percent of flu seasons peaked in 
February, and 16 percent peaked in 
March. This means it’s still prime time 
to contract and spread the flu.

We never think we’re the one who’s 
going to get sick, and on a national 
scale this mentality may lead to larger 
problems. According to a review 
from the non-profit groups Trust 
for America’s Health and the Robert 
Woods Johnson Foundation, most 
American states receive a failing grade 
in their public health emergency 
plans. As a nation, we’re completely 
unprepared for an infectious disease 
disaster — partly due to ignorance, 
sequestration and anti-vaccination 
campaigns.

Last week, the Obama administra-
tion announced a plan to improve the 
surveillance and treatment of infec-
tious diseases over the next five years. 
Disease knows no borders, and it’s 
important to take infectious disease 
seriously, as an outbreak in one com-
munity can have devastating conse-
quences for its neighbors and across 
the globe. The 2003 SARS outbreak 
began in China and was covered up 
by federal authorities there, allowing 
infected airline passengers to carry the 
disease to dozens of other countries. 
The virus is reported to have killed 
770 people and had devastating eco-
nomic impacts in Asia and Canada. 
Infectious diseases cause widespread 
social disruption, affecting schools, 
hospitals, tourism and the workplace.

Despite the dangers of infectious 
disease, vaccine denial is still a huge 
problem — a study in pediatrics 
claimed vaccine denial contributed 
significantly to California’s record-
breaking whooping cough outbreak 
in 2010. Measles was thought to be 
eradicated but has made a comeback 
in recent years, likely because of per-
vasive anti-vaccine beliefs, says the 
CDC. During the 2008 San Diego 
measles outbreak, 60 percent of fami-
lies chose to stay quarantined rather 
than have their children immunized 
and return to school. California 
parents can easily get immunization 
exemption for their kids if the vac-
cines go against their personal beliefs. 
This exemption and the ease at which 
it can be accessed gives anti-immu-
nization campaigns more power and 
endangers the population.

Vaccines are not dangerous — 
they will not give you the flu, and 
the side effects are mild, if present at 
all. The Wakefield study correlating 
vaccines with autism was retracted 
and found to be an elaborate fraud. 
Some people aren’t vaccinated sim-
ply because they can’t bother. Only 
12 states vaccinated at least half of 
their population for the seasonal 
flu in 2012 — the goal is 80 percent 
immunization to prevent the spread 
of infectious disease and protect vul-
nerable populations.

It’s all of our responsibility to do 
our part in immunization campaigns, 
not just for our own health, but also 
for that of our neighbors. It’s never too 
late to get a vaccination.

Minimum wage increases may compensate for inflation rates, but in order to 
effectively reduce poverty, government subsidies must also be implemented.

Critics of the Hasbro and 3-D Systems partner-
ship fail to account for the production efficacy of 
such merchandise, the creativity that it promotes 
and, lastly, its unprecedented potential to redefine 
recreation. 3-D printing extends beyond leisure-
based product development; its wide range of 
useful and progressive applications has made it a 
pivotal tool, specifically in the biomedical field.

Prototypes have already been employed in the 
creation of windpipes, hearing aids and low-cost 
prosthetics — and by the end of 2014, biotechnol-
ogy firm Organovo plans to release the first 3-D 
printed liver. Accessibility to manufactured organs 
is a matter of serious public interest, as approxi-
mately 18 people die every day in the United States 
waiting for an organ transplant, according to the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
About 120,000 Americans are on the organ wait-
ing list and face the risk of incompatibility even in 
the case of a donation. With 3-D printing, how-
ever, organs are regenerated with a sample of the 
patient’s own stem cells, eliminating any possibility 
of rejection. These products demonstrate their 
potential to save lives and improve global health.

Whether it’s with toy parts or body parts, the 
new prototypical platform has broken barriers 
that manual production has long sustained. 3-D 
printing seeks to actively engage the consumer and 
should be supported for its potential to reinvent 
the current merchandising experience. Despite 
speculative negative responses, this new technology 
has revolutionized medicine, enhanced product 
development and given way to a world of innova-
tive possibility.

Printing Technology Marks a
Move Toward Self-Sustainability

3-D Printing Revolutionizes Medicine 
and Can Improve Personal Health

The experience of excitedly rushing home to 
assemble a new piece of furniture only to find out 
that one piece is missing is inconvenient and frus-
trating. Fortunately, this inconvenience now has a 
solution — 3-D printing. Not only does 3-D print-
ing cater to individuals for personal use, it also has 
the potential to benefit entrepreneurs.

3-D printing has great potential to expand DIY 
technology. According to the Huffington Post, 3-D 
printers are capable of making things like chocolate, 
guitars and shoes — all can potentially be easily 
manufactured by small businesses or individuals.

3-D printing can also make production pro-
cesses more viable and efficient by streamlining 
the process of prototype-making. According to 
Forbes, 3-D printers’ efficiency saves time and 
money by allowing entrepreneurs to first print 
their prototypes at home and then send the infor-
mation to manufacturing offices for a finished 
product. This process would significantly decrease 
the time that materials spend in transit, minimize 
labor expenditures and reduce environmental 
impact. This would allow relative independence 
from manufacturers in the initial design process. 
3-D printing could thereby eliminate common 
problems that arise due to a lack of communica-
tion between designers and manufacturers, giving 
designers more freedom.

Commodities like instruments, prosthetics and 
clothing are only a few of the many possibilities that 
3-D printing will be able to provide. With further 
development and accessibility, 3-D printing has the 
potential to bridge the gap between DIY and profes-
sional manufacturing.

The concept of 3-D printing is undoubtedly 
interesting, but the developing technology has 
introduced a whole new set of societal health and 
safety risks. The open, do-it-yourself nature of 3-D 
printing holds no one responsible for product reg-
ulations, but dangerously gives users the opportu-
nity to create virtually anything with downloaded 
blueprints from the Internet.

Hasbro may be willing to introduce 3-D print-
ing technology in its line of children’s’ toys, but 
for justifiable reasons, not everyone is on board. 
According to The Guardian, Mattel and Lego have 
both released statements against allowing con-
sumers to print their own versions of Hot Wheels 
racecars and Lego bricks at home. Because these 
toys are intended to be used by children, safety 
and durability tests are held at utmost importance; 
printed toys are just not viable replacements for the 
manufactured toys that require quality and perfor-
mance tests before hitting store shelves.

3-D printers will also allow owners to create 
lethal weapons overnight. In May 2013, Defense 
Distributed founder Cody Wilson released prints 
for the Liberator, the world’s first 3-D-printed gun, 
which is made of plastic and can go undetected by 
any metal security detector. Recognizing the risk, 
the U.S. Department of State pulled the prints from 
Wilson’s website two days after their release. But 
according to Forbes, the Liberator already had well 
over 100,000 downloads before it was removed.

3-D printing has offered positive contributions 
but at a hefty price. At the end of the day, main-
taining public safety must be prioritized before 3-D 
printers become commonplace in every home.

Poor college students desperately seek employment and usually have to depend on a notoriously low $8-per-hour minimum wage that can’t even pay for 
a movie ticket. Fortunately, they can breathe a little easier 
now, as President Obama finally delivered his promise 
on raising the minimum wage earlier this month. Obama 
signed an executive order increasing the minimum wage 
for federal employees from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per 
hour in adjustment for inflation by 2015; Democrats are 
also proposing an ambitious $12 wage by 2017. In the 
meantime, states are taking action on the same front. 
California plans to increase its state minimum wage from 
$8 per hour to $9 by July 1, 2014 and eventually up to 
$10 by 2016. Ultimately, this will help the millions of 
employed Americans who still struggle to pay their bills 

despite their hard work in minimum wage jobs.
The last federal minimum wage increase was in 2009 

and was based on a reform bill passed in 2007; it has been 
seven years since Congress has touched the issue. Though 
a wage increase was long overdue at the time, excessive 
adjustment could have had a negative impact on econom-
ic growth. With the cost of living and inflation in the U.S. 
now on the rise, however, raising the minimum wage is 
crucial for people to be able to afford basic necessities. 

While San Diego calls itself “America’s Finest City,” its 
cost of living is also one of the highest. The cost of liv-
ing is 7 percent above the national average income with 
an average annual household expenditure of $52,012. It

Minimum Wage Increase Should Be Accompanied by Federal Initiatives to Reduce Burden on Businesses

would take an hourly wage of $27 
per hour for a family of four to make 
ends meet. The White House also 
admitted that even a minimum wage 
of $9 is far from meeting the present 
cost of living, since this only restores 
America’s inflation-adjusted value 
to where it was in 1981. The current 
minimum wage laws are insuffi-
cient to meet the basic needs of the 
people, and it is imperative to adjust 
wage according to inflation rates.  

Raising the federal minimum 
wage is not only beneficial to col-
lege students’ and low-income 
families’ short-term finances, but 
will also help stimulate the economy 
on a broader scale. A 2011 Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago study 

showed that a $1-increase in mini-
mum wage would stimulate con-
sumer spending by $2,800 a year 
in households with minimum wage 
earners. In addition, the Economic 
Policy Institute estimated that a mini-
mum wage hike would pump $21 
billion into the economy. With more 
money in their pockets, low-income 
families would be more likely to make 
additional discretionary purchases 
alongside daily necessities like food, 
clothing and shelter. The capital used 
to increase minimum wage would 
eventually cycle back to businesses in 
the form of consumer spending and 
help boost the economy. 

However, caution should be 
exercised. Dramatically adjusting 
or rapidly increasing the mini-
mum wage might curb job growth 

and be impractical to enforce. The 
Congressional Budget Office pro-
jected that a wage of $10 per hour 
would reduce total employment by 
about 500,000 workers, as businesses 
seek to avoid the costs associated with 
higher-wage workers. Additionally, 
economist Milton Friedman called 
raising the minimum wage a form 
of discrimination against low-skilled 
workers. In a competitive market, any 
increase in labor cost would require 
budget cuts to compensate, and often, 
the first to lose jobs would be the 
least skilled. If the private sector can-
not keep up with the increasing labor 
cost demanded by law, a minimum 
wage increase could become counter-
productive to its original intent.

Essentially, the key to relieving 
poverty and increasing the standard 

of living lies with both the public 
and private sectors. Government-
financed solutions, such as tax credits 
or wage subsidies, could succeed as 
complementary programs to take the 
full burden off businesses. In a 2011 
study conducted by economists David 
Neumark and William Wascher, a 
higher minimum wage, along with 
federal Earned Income Tax Credit, 
would increase both employment 
and earnings for single women with 
children. However, Congress rejected 
such suggestions because it would 
put a strain on the federal budget. 
This decision is troubling, as federally 
mandating higher wages and placing 
the burden of financing on private 
business owners is somewhat hypo-
critical. Efforts from both sectors are 
needed to produce a comprehensive 

solution through a combination of 
sensible minimum wage increases 
and federal subsidization.

As the movement for a higher 
minimum wage grows in scale, 
the magnitude of wage raise must 
ultimately only be determined after 
careful scrutiny. A sensible mini-
mum wage to compensate for infla-
tion will benefit both Americans and 
the national economy, but overly 
increasing or rapidly adjusting mini-
mum wage level could have negative 
repercussions on job growth. Both 
the public and private sectors must 
share the burden of relieving poverty 
and take accountability for their role 
in society.

UCSD IN A SNAP
!"#$%&'"(#)&*+%%,##--##./01%*0(,#($$0$1(+1

A bra hanging on a tree and a penis drawn in the sand — these are just two of the many images posted on 
the UCSD Snaps Facebook page, which was 
launched on Feb. 6 by an anonymous UCSD 
senior, who, for the purposes of this article, 
will be referred to as “John Smith.” Smith 
also founded the popular UCSD Memes and 
UCSD Confessions pages. In fact, Smith started 
UCSD Snaps at the suggestion of a girl on the 
Confessions page.

Sophomore Isabel D’Elia posted a link to 
the NYU Snaps page on Feb. 5, saying, “UCSD 
desperately needs this!!!!”

Smith responded through the UCSD 
Confessions account a day later and said, “you 
mean this?” Below was the link to the newly 
created UCSD Snaps.

“I started UCSD Snaps [to foster] unity 
and social collaboration [at UCSD],” Smith 
said. “Collaboration leads to perspective, which 
leads to innovation. Some of the biggest inven-
tions and platforms, such as Facebook and 
Snapchat, were based on collaboration.”

Unlike UCSD Memes, where Smith primar-
ily generates the majority of the memes himself, 
UCSD Snaps is fueled by student submissions. 
Students either send photos through Facebook 
messages to the page or send them over through 
Snapchat to the username UCSDSNAPS. 

Most pictures received are posted, except 
for those that Smith deems as showing illicit 
activities or those which people message him 
about with legitimate concerns. Smith also tries 
to avoid pictures that are too personal, usually 
those which show people’s faces. He makes cer-
tain exceptions, though.

“Sleeping in class is fair game,” Smith said.
Common themes in the received snaps 

include Geisel, numerous references to weed, 
though Smith does not post these, food and 
scenic views. Some of the most popular snaps 
include one snap of a student with an orange 
peel in his mouth, saying, “This is more fun 
than hum reading.” Another is a picture of 
a Peet’s Coffee & Tea sign which says, “You 
haven’t had enough coffee until you can thread 

a sewing machine while it’s running.” Another 
snap showed black birds, possibly vultures, 
circling in the cloudy sky. The caption reads, 
“Something died. My GPA.”

The page, which has almost 2,000 likes 
and 250 posted snaps at the moment, is still 
ramping up; Smith receives about 30 snaps 
through the Snapchat account a day. At this 
point, UCSD has a long way to go before it 
achieves the success of UCSD Memes and 
UCSD Confessions, which have nearly 9,000 
and 10,000 likes, respectively. 

“One thing I really like [about UCSD Snaps] 
is that it’s like a ticker,” Smith said. “It’s like the 
news; I have updates. One morning, I got like 
seven snaps talking about how foggy it was. By 
the time I got to campus, it wasn’t foggy, but 
without [UCSD Snaps], I wouldn’t have known 
it was foggy. It’s like having a lot of eyes watch-
ing out for things.”

The snaps that he’s received so far, along 
with the posts he has overseen on the UCSD 
Memes and UCSD Confessions pages, have 
helped Smith to gain a better understanding of 
the UCSD campus.

“Our campus is very diverse,” he said. “I get 
snaps that represent all sorts of people. I get 
snapshots of people that I wouldn’t get other-
wise without being their friend. I get to peek 
inside their lives.”

As Smith is graduating this year, he hopes 
to maintain the pages he started from a dis-
tance with help from a team of students that 
is already helping him to run UCSD Memes 
and UCSD Confessions. However, in taking a 
more backseat position in the management of 
the pages, Smith feels he will lose his unique 
connection with UCSD.

“If I don’t run the pages, I won’t be as 
in tune with UCSD,” Smith said. “Sure, I 
can read The Guardian. Sure, I can go on 
[UCSD Snaps, UCSD Memes and UCSD 
Confessions] later, but I’m not getting the 
raw version. I’m getting the filtered ver-
sion, because usually only half the snaps get 
posted. I wouldn’t be able to see UCSD in its 
‘rawness’ — stripped down.”

The creator of UCSD Memes and UCSD Confessions talks 
about his newest Facebook page, UCSD Snaps, which shares 

students’ snapchats with the campus community.

When he first came to college, 
UCSD alumnus Brian Grassadonia 
thought he wanted to be a mechani-
cal engineer. But after discovering his 
passion for business three years into 
his undergraduate career, Grassadonia 
began pursuing a degree in 
Management Science and is 
now Director of Product at 
Square, Inc. Square, named 
for the company’s small 
square device that plugs into 
phones and tablets to enable 
electronic exchanges of 
money, is a financial service 
built on the idea that mon-
etary transactions should be 
as easy as possible. 

Grassadonia, who graduated from 
Revelle College in 2006, describes his 
experience at UCSD as an opportunity 
to hone in on the exact kind of “think-
ing outside the box” that he uses at 
Square today.

“Back when I was in school, I was 
always really interested in the internet 
space and startup technology compa-
nies,” Grassadonia said. 

According to him, UCSD didn’t 
offer many opportunities for students 
interested in business finance, so 
Grassadonia had to seek alternative 
options in order to break into the 
industry. He applies many of the same 
principles in his job now, creating new 
innovations such as Square Cash.

Grassadonia is the co-creator and 
current head of Square Cash, an app 
which allows for person-to-person 
money transfers through email. The 
app acts as a free intermediary to 
which people link their accounts 
after carbon copying cash@square.
com and allows users to transfer up 

to $2,500 a month. It has received 
generally positive feedback from the 
public since its launch in October 
2013. A review by www.cnet.com edi-
tors gave the app four out of five stars, 
claiming, “There’s no better way to 
send cash to someone.”

Surrounding himself with co-
workers who embody success, 

Grassadonia says, is a key 
way to stimulate his own 
advancement in projects 
like Square Cash.

“The amazing thing 
about [my job] is that, for 
me, it’s a platform to do my 
best work,” he said. “We 
have world-class engi-
neers, designers, product 
managers — world-class 

people across the board. I’ve found 
that putting myself in situations 
where there are people who are going 
to push the boundaries […] is really 
going to help me.”

The most important aspect of 
a successful career to Grassadonia, 
however, is a lesson he learned 
in following his true passion. He 
believes that choosing the career 
path you love is the most important 
way to be successful.

“Don’t settle,” he said. “It can be 
scary when you’re in college, and 
you’re at the end of your fourth year, 
and you know you have to get a job out 
of school, and you’re worried about the 
trajectory you’re going to be on. I saw 
a lot of people settle for that first job. 
Career progression has compounding 
effects ... Make sure you’re focused on 
doing the things that make you happy, 
not just [choosing] the major that’s 
going to make your parents happy.”

As spring quarter approaches, a 
fraction of Tritons will begin search-
ing for off-campus housing. They 
will likely turn to UCSD’s off-campus 
housing directory, Craigslist or ran-
dom housing ads. However, Corey 
Breier, UCSD’s lead campus founder of 
OnMyBlock — an online service and 
mobile app designed to ease the pro-
cess of moving off campus — believes 
there’s a better avenue to finding col-
lege housing.

“The social referral process works 
if you get lucky and put a lot of work 
into it [or] are well-connected,” he said. 
“But there’s no reason there should not 
be a platform for it.”

OMB, which will launch tomorrow, 
Feb. 25, aims to become the one-stop 
shop for off-campus housing for stu-
dents. Students can use the iOS app or 
website to search for housing and read 
past tenant reviews.

OMB was founded by USD alum-
nus Morgan Schwanke, who used 
to sublease the homes of friends 
that were studying abroad to other 
students. He saw that students were 
constantly on the move and wanted 
to address this issue through his 
platform, which allows users to tai-
lor their housing searches to find 
leases as short as three months.

“A lot of apartment leases are for 
one year [even if] you [only] want it 
for nine months because you don’t 
need it for the summer.” Brier said. 

With OMB, users can start by 
choosing the college they attend and 
then adjust their search based on 
neighborhood, number of bathrooms 
and bedrooms and availability. But 
OMB is more than just a search tool; 
it allows users to write reviews of the 
places they’ve lived at, bringing the 
social aspect of college housing online. 

“You as a student are looking 
for a place that is friendly towards 
students ... Maybe you’re looking for 
a quieter place or [maybe] a louder 
place where you can host parties ... 
The reviews from past students who 
have lived there will help you make a 
more informed choice towards your 
next house.”

Students repelled by the faceless 
nature of Craigslist may find more 
confidence in OMB’s tenant feedback 
and a feature called a “fact sheet” that 
summarizes a listings’ perks.

“Craigslist is just a name and a 
number, whereas, with [OMB], you 
will definitely have a rough picture of 
that person you are going to live with... 
and you will have students [giving 
feedback,” Breier said.

The true test will come after the 
platform has cultivated a large enough 
following for listings to have regular 
reviews. It is, after all, this aspect that 
is supposed to set OMB apart from 
other options. 

The OMB team has a lot plans 
for its future: launching an Android 
app, integrating student reviews 
of nearby stores and restaurants, 
enabling bidding on popular list-
ings and creating “Facebook-style” 
roommate profiles. To bring the 
rental experience full circle, OMB 
also wants to give users the ability to 
sign their lease right on their phone 
or laptop. 

OMB is flyering on Library Walk 
on March 2 and hopes to increase 
awareness of their service among 
students. While OMB doesn’t tell 
students everything they need to 
know about moving off campus — 
you need to buy real dishes —  it 
may be an organized start to finding 
a temporary place to call home.

The UCSD men’s volleyball team 
extended one of the longest losing 
streaks in program history last week, 
losing to Cal State Northridge and 
Cal State Long Beach both in three 
sets on the road. With last week’s loss-
es, UCSD is now 0–14 overall and 
0–13 in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation series. On Wednesday 
night, the Tritons took on No. 15 Cal 
State Northridge in the Matadome, 
falling in three straight sets with scores 
of 25–20, 25–21 and 25–21.

Triton head coach Kevin Ring 
explained to the UCSD athletics 
department that going down early in 
the first two sets made it tough for 
them to get back in the match. The 
Tritons made runs in each of those 
first two sets but spotted Cal State 
Northridge too many early points.

UCSD hit 0.295 for the match but 
failed to sideout effectively.

“For us to better challenge our 
opponents game by game we need to 
sideout 68 percent and above,” Ring 
said. “We got great production from 
Eric Barber as he hit 0.533. After a 
slow start, Mike Brunsting got going 
and finished with 12 kills. Mathew 
Schnitzer was strong in the middle as 
he hit 0.444. If we can get three to four 
players all putting up good numbers in 
the same set, we’ll begin to win games 
and matches.”

On Friday night, UCSD fought 
No. 6 nationally-ranked Cal State 

Long Beach, an MPSF conference 
powerhouse. But the 49ers were too 
hot to handle for the Tritons who 
were swept again with scores of 
11–25, 15–25 and 16–25.

“When you play a top caliber team 
you’ve got to keep your strengths as 
strengths,” Ring said to the UCSD 
athletics department. “Tonight, I felt 
like Long Beach was able to pres-
sure us into making uncharacteristic 
plays. As the season moves forward, 
we need improved consistency as well 
as a level of competitive maturity so we 
can bring out our best against the best.”

Redshirt sophomore outside hitter 
Eric Barber — whose 10 kills against 
Northridge marked a career-high — 
continued to put up good, offensive 
numbers as he hit 0.294 with seven 
kills.  Senior setter Mike Brunsting 
also hit 0.263 with nine kills, while 
Redshirt freshman middle blocker 
Mathew Schnitzer hit an impressive 
0.556 with six kills.

The Tritons are back at RIMAC 
Arena this week to host Grand 
Canyon University, a non-conference 
opponent, on Friday, Feb. 28, before 
resuming MPSF play against UC Santa 
Barbara the following night.

Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State both 
swept UCSD, which remains at the bottom of the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference. 

Tritons Have Two More Games to Secure Tournament Berth

“He’s been huge for us and he 
was obviously huge for us tonight,” 
Olen said. “When he’s aggressive, and 
that’s the kind of way he’s developed 
throughout the year, you can see him 
getting more and more comfortable. 
You can see him starting to be more 
aggressive and attacking the basket.”

Sophomore center Zach McMillan 
made his return from injury after miss-
ing six games, playing five minutes 
and grabbing a rebound. McMillan 
leads the team in rebounding at 6.1 
per game.“He brings depth to us, espe-
cially inside,” Olen said. “We’re playing 
some guards inside right now because 
we’ve been limited with injuries. Zach 
brings a toughness, a physicality, a 
defensive presence.”

The following night, UCSD failed 
to repeat its impressive shooting per-
formance, as Sonoma State bested the 
Tritons in UCSD’s last home game 
of the season. Senior guards James 

McCann, Matt Bailey and MacKenzie 
McCullough were honored before 
the game.With McCullough out for 
the season due to an ACL injury and 
McMillan still returning to form, 
the Tritons’ biggest weakness against 
the Seawolves was their lack of size. 
Sonoma State’s senior forwards Steve 
Lackey, 6 feet 7 inches, and Justin 
Herold, 6 feet 8 inches, took advantage 
of the gap down low, allowing the 
Seawolves to out-rebound the Tritons 
37–26 while also outscoring 26–16 in 
the paint.A barrage of Sonoma State 
three-pointers in the first half gave the 
Seawolves a 10-point lead.

The Tritons never led after the 
13-minute mark in the first half. 
McCann and sophomore forward 
Drew Dyer were the only two Tritons 
to finish the game in double dig-
its, scoring 20 points and 19 points, 
respectively. With only two games 
remaining in the season, the Tritons 
sit with a 10–10 record, still strug-
gling for that sixth and final spot 

for the postseason tournament.The 
Tritons will play at Cal State Los 
Angeles (11–9) next Friday and at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills (4–16) next 
Saturday, games that will determine 
the teams that will contend for the 
CCAA Championship. UCSD won 
both matchups earlier in the season. 

Meanwhile, San Francisco State 
will host Cal State East Bay (4–16) and 
Cal State Monterey Bay (7–13). The 
Gators are 6–3 at home this season.

“Anything can happen once we 
get into March and that’s just the 
way basketball is,” Klie said when 
asked about the remaining stretch 
of the season. “We’re trying to put 
ourselves in that position right now 
and we’ll see what happens when we 
get there. I think this team can go a 
long way. We’re a special team and 
we know if we bring it every night 
we can beat anybody, anytime.”

“I think [Erin’s] a winner,” 
VanDerveer said. “[Erin] competes 
and battles, and she’s capable. You 
should pencil in a double-double 
for [her] about every night, and I 
thought she really set the tone for our 
team tonight.” 

The Tritons also found significant 
help from the bench as freshman for-
ward Cassie MacLeod continued to 
impress, racking up 16 points as sec-
ond best for UCSD on Friday night. 

UCSD played its final home 
game of the season against last-place 
Sonoma State the following day, 
defeating the Seawolves 62–47. A 
ceremony honoring the four senior 
Tritons (Erin Dautremont, Kim 
Manlangit, Rachel Marty and Megan 
Perry) preceded the contest, which 
had 11 different Tritons convert. 

VanDerveer spoke highly of her 
senior group.

“They’re the keepers of a cham-
pionship culture,” VanDerveer said. 
“Workers win and winners work, and 
I think this group specifically is a testa-
ment to that.”   

Every Triton got playing time on 
senior night and together, UCSD 
restricted Sonoma State to just 25 per-
cent (8–32) shooting from the field in 
the second half and out-rebounded 
the Seawolves 46 to 21 for the game. 

While Sonoma State led early in 
the game, the Tritons gradually began 
to pull away midway through the first 
half, closing out the period with a 
significant 38–22 edge. For the second 
straight night, UCSD refused to give 
up the advantage in the second half 
and at one point led the Seawolves by 
as much as 24 points. 

After another successful weekend, 

UCSD hopes to build off its momen-
tum to secure a spot in the postseason 
CCAA tournament in Ontario, Calif.

“I think we just take every pos-
session, every game, at a time,” 
VanDerveer said. “I think we’re play-
ing very well right now, and as long 
as we continue to improve every day, I 
like our chances.” 

The Tritons will finish off their 
season on the road, playing their 
final two games against Cal State Los 
Angeles on Friday, Feb. 28 and Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on Saturday, 
March 1. Both games will be crucial 
to their standing, as Cal State Los 
Angeles is third in the standings and 
the Tritons are tied with Dominguez 
Hills for fourth. Tip-off for the pair of 
games is slated for 5:30 p.m.

Send-off

Eight senior Tritons played their 
final career home games at 

RIMAC Arena this past weekend.

Four Straight Wins

The UCSD men’s basket-
ball team took one step closer 
to solidifying its position in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association tournament after 
blowing out San Francisco State 
(10–10), scoring 76–51 on Friday 
before taking one step back, los-
ing the following day to Sonoma 
State (5–15) by 76–58 in its final 
home game of the season.

UCSD is now tied with San 
Francisco State for the sixth and 
final CCAA tournament berth.

The Tritons’ first basket 
against San Francisco State — a 
corner three sunk by freshman 
redshirt guard Aleks Lipovic — 
opened the floodgates for UCSD’s 
perimeter shooters. The Tritons 
hit 17 three-pointers on 52 per-
cent shooting from beyond the 
arc, seven of which came from 
Lipovic.

“It’s a big part of our offense,” 
UCSD head coach Eric Olen said 
when asked about their perimeter 
offense. “We have some guys that 
can shoot the ball and we have a 
point guard that can find them. 

We really got it going tonight 
and sometimes that stuff is con-
tagious.”

The first half was close, as 
the Tritons struggled to stop the 
Gators, who shot 57 percent from 
the field. However, the Tritons’ 
seven threes in the first half kept 
the game tight with the score 
34–33 at intermission.

UCSD dominated the sec-
ond half, as the Tritons stepped 
up defensively to shut down any 
offensive spark from the Gators. 
San Francisco was limited to just 
13 percent shooting from the field 
in the second period and made 
only three field goals. UCSD also 
forced San Francisco to make 18 
turnovers, which the Tritons con-
verted for 15 points. The Tritons 
continued to shoot well, outscor-
ing San Francisco State 43–17 in 
the second half and, at one point, 
hit three consecutive three-point-
ers to blow the game out.

Freshman guard Adam Klie 
scored a career-high 24 points. 
He also added five rebounds and 
two steals.

UCSD bid farewell to 
its senior Tritons with 
a pre-game ceremony 

on Saturday night.

After a pair of road victories 
last week, the UCSD women’s bas-
ketball returned to its home turf 
this weekend, winning against 
San Francisco State 74–69 on 
Friday and 62–47 against Sonoma 
State. With their four-game win-
ning streak, the Tritons, now 
12–8 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, have freed 
themselves from a three-way tie 
for fifth and are now fighting 
for third place against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills and Cal State 
Los Angeles. 

Only the top six teams will 
qualify for the postseason, but 
with only one game separating 
third place — UCSD, Cal State 
L.A. and Dominguez Hills — 
from sixth place Cal State East 
Bay, the Tritons will still need to 
finish out their regular season 
schedule strong.

On Friday evening, UCSD 
and San Francisco State — one 
of the teams previously tied with 
UCSD for fifth place — both shot 
well, going 46 percent (27–59) 
and 40 percent (24–60) from the 

field respectively. The Tritons also 
drained 10 of 23 attempts from 
beyond the arc.

During the first half, both 
the Tritons and the Gators trad-
ed leads throughout, but UCSD 
closed out the period on top with 
a 38–34 advantage. 

In the second half, the Tritons 
expanded their lead. Though the 
Gators put up a strong fight, the 
Tritons held on to their lead for 
the entire second period to ulti-
mately pick up the win. 

“It was a huge win,” UCSD 
head coach Heidi VanDerveer 
said. “I think our team battled. 
We came in very prepared, and 
we know that every game is really 
important. They stepped up to a 
challenge and got a great win for 
our team.”

Senior forward Erin 
Dautremont was UCSD’s leading 
scorer for the second consecutive 
weekend. Dautremont has been 
red-hot as of late as she recorded 
her fifth double-double of the sea-
son (22 points, 10 rebounds), her 
second in only three games.
