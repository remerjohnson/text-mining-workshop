Police Arrest Suspects in 
Price Center Arson Case

Two UCSD students are under suspicion of setting two fires in Price Center on Dec. 3, the same day the 
University Centers Advisory Board announced plans to open a Starbucks in place of Espresso Roma Cafe. 

UCSD students Hoai Vi Holly Thuy Nguyen and Maya Land were arrested by San 
Diego Police last week for their sus-
pected involvement with an two inci-
dents of arson in Price Center which 
occurred on Dec. 3.

Police took Nguyen, 22, into cus-
tody after identifying her in surveil-
lance video footage that showed her 
and a suspect later identified as Land 
entering and leaving Price Center, 
suggesting Nguyen’s participation in 
the ignition of two fires. According to 
Police Lieutenant Kevin Mayer, Land, 
21, turned herself in following public 
release of the footage on YouTube.

According to a Feb. 7 report by the 
San Diego County Crime Stoppers, 
Nguyen and Land lit a fire after enter-
ing a bathroom on the first levels 

of Price Center East and West, 
leaving shortly thereafter. The 
two suspects then lit a fire in a 
bathroom on the second floor of 
Price Center, after 
re-entering the 
building wearing 
different attire.

At the time of 
the fires, police 
reported that 
hundreds of stu-
dents occupied 
the building, although no injuries 
were detected as a result of the 
fire. However, police evacuated 
the building for approximately 
one hour and 15 minutes while 
the fires were extinguished.

Vietnam War Memorial 
Unveiled in Revelle College 

UCSA Launches Calif. 
Prop 13 Reform Campaign
The new initiative, Fund the UC, aims to close tax 
loopholes and direct more money toward education.

Rady School 
to Offer
Master of  
Finance

Revelle College recently unveiled 
a memorial next to the Revelle Plaza 
fountain that honors student activ-
ism for peace. The May 1970 Peace 
Memorial features a semicircle plaque 
with a constellation of lights, a coral 
tree and a bench — to provide a site 
of remembrance for the campus pro-
tests for peace. The inscription on the 
plaque reads, “For George Winne Jr., 
the student activists of May 1970 and 
all those who continue the struggle for 

a peaceful world.”
Ph.D. literature student Niall 

Twohig, along with a group of stu-
dents in Thurgood Marshall College’s 
Dimensions of Culture program 
wanted to commemorate an important 
part of history that is often forgotten. 
Spurred by conversations with DOC 
students in discussions five years ear-
lier, Twohig and a few others wanted 
to have a memorial in the former 
free speech area in Revelle to remem-
ber the histories of activism from the 
1960–70s. The plaque memorializes 
the events of May 1970 and the unrest 
among the UCSD student population 
and the rest of the nation due to the 
Vietnam War.

Almost 50 organizations from 
around the state have formed a coali-
tion to actively campaign for reform-
ing California’s Proposition 13. These 
reforms would bring an additional $6 
billion in commercial taxes to ease 
the UC system’s budget deficit. The 
movement is currently spearhead-
ed by the University of California 
Student Association, a campus-wide 
advocacy and student governance 
group.

Proposition 13 is known official-
ly as the People’s Initiative to Limit 
Property Taxation and was passed 

in 1978. It effectively froze annual 
real estate taxation to 1 percent of a 
property’s assessed value. This value 
could only increase by a maximum 
of 2 percent a year until the property 
changes ownership. At that point, a 
new base-assessed value would be 
assigned, which generally increases 
through the years. The measure was 
intended to lower strain and unpre-
dictability for homeowners.

However, according to the UCSA, 
major companies like Wal-Mart and 
Chevron have heavily exploited the 
law because they have technically

UCSD’s Rady School of 
Management introduced a new 
Master of Finance program for grad-
uate students beginning in the 2014–
15 school year. 

The 52-unit program comprises 
fall, winter, spring and summer quar-
ter, with classes such as Investment 
and Analysis and Advanced Financial 
Risk Management. The program con-
cludes with a summer project where 
students are meant to apply their 
education to a project from their own 
experience or workplace.

An announcement from the Rady 
School of Management emphasized 
UCSD’s ability to provide a unique 
perspective on a finance program.

“UC San Diego has a rich tra-
dition in empirical and theoretical 
econometrics with some of the most 
widely used empirical models devel-
oped from the research of UC San 
Diego faculty,” the statement read. 
“The emphasis on rigorous empirical 
data-driven methods differentiates 
the Rady School’s Master of Finance 
from programs specializing in finan-
cial engineering.”

Rady professor of finance Allan 
Timmerman also believes UCSD is 
an ideal campus to provide a Master 
of Finance degree.

“Some of today’s most important 
tools for risk management and fore-
casting of economic time-series were 
developed at UC San Diego and led 
to the 2003 Nobel Prize in Economics 
being awarded to UC San Diego fac-
ulty Robert Engle and Clive Granger,” 
Allan said. “This tradition is reflected 
in the Master of Finance program’s 
focus on time-series econometrics, 
forecasting and risk management.”

Lieutenant Kevin Mayer were among 
those heading the investigation.

“The Metro Arson Strike Team 
worked very closely with UCSD to 
solve this arson case,” Mayer said.

Los Angeles Times reporter Tony 
Perry told the Guardian that police 
believe Nguyen and Land started 
the fires in protest of new devel-
opments in Price Center regard-
ing a new Starbucks branch that 
will replace the fair trade Espresso 
Roma Cafe.

The fires were lit the same 
day that the University Centers 
Advisory Board voted 11-4-0 to 
open a Starbucks in Price Center. 
The decision to place a Starbucks 
in Price Center was surrounded 
by controversy due to allegations 
that Starbucks violates UCSD’s 
University Fair Trade Policy, which 
targets coffees, teas, sugars, choco-
lates and creams.

According to a public Facebook 
post by Lee Aronson, a member 
at the UCSD Food Cooperative, 
police held Nguyen in custody for 

72 hours.
“This evening we arrived at home 

and found that a search warrant had 
been executed on our apartment 
during the day,” Aronson wrote in 
the post. “During the arraignment, 
the prosecutor made several refer-
ences to Vi as an activist, and during 
the search they seized several books 
associated with ‘the left.’”

Aronson asked for help finding 
legal representation for Nguyen and 
announced that only messages con-
taining information about a defense 
attorney or words of support would 
be addressed.

According to a Feb. 7 Los Angeles 
Times article by Tony Perry, Nguyen 
pleaded not guilty to two counts 
of arson in a San Diego County 
Superior Court on Feb. 6. Police 
are continuing their investigation in 
search of more information.

“As always, we want to thank 
the public for their support and the 
tips they provide,” Mayer said. “The 
investigation is continuing.”

ing the time was George Winne Jr., a 
UCSD graduating senior in History. 
He chose to self-immolate in Revelle 
Plaza on May 10, 1970 as an antiwar 
message. Although faculty and stu-
dents have held vigils in Revelle Plaza 
to remember the students who protest-
ed, Twohig and the students felt that 
Winne’s memory fell into disrepute.

“Many people for-
got his anti-war message and 
instead characterized him as a 
psychologically troubled loner 
who was disconnected from 
any social movement,” the 
supporters of the May 1970 Peace 

Memorial said in their proposal.
According to Twohig, the idea for 

the memorial is to promote peace and 
to have a piece that represents stu-
dent activism and the history behind 
student protest — an often buried or 
forgotten history — and so the memo-
rial aims to restore the history to the 
campus space.

“Far from being a loner, Winne’s 
gesture was linked to countless people 
at UCSD, across the nation and around 
the world who desired a peaceful world 
and an end to warfare,” Twohig said. 
«The goal is to represent the desire 
that Winne and the student activists 
of stood for — a desire for peace and 
justice.”

With the help of literature professor 
Jorge Mariscal, director of the DOC 
program, students worked closely 
with the Resource Management and 
Planning staff on the design of the 
memorial to bring the concept to life.

“I hope that long after the peo-
ple who worked on the memorial are 
gone, others will return to the site and 
find inspiration in its history and mes-
sage,” Twohig said. “I hope that they 
see a larger shape beyond the indi-
vidual and collective acts of 1970 — a 
desire that links student activists across 
time and across space.”

 

This week’s council meeting kicked 
off with public input from Mariko 
Kuga, VC Internal of Thurgood 
Marshall College, and last year’s 
Marshall Senator on behalf of the rati-
fication process of the A.S. Council 
bylaw changes. 

“As a student I love feeling empow-
ered and that my voice is being heard,” 
Kuga said. “What’s the point of hav-
ing college councils 
if A.S. is just going to 
have a campuswide 
vote.” 

I guess this meet-
ing’s theme is “empowerment,” as it 
was repeated frequently throughout 
the rest of the meeting.

“I’m getting really, really empow-
ered by my senator project, so I want 
to help share the love with my other 
senators if they haven’t started their 
projects yet,” physical sciences Senator 
Sierra Donaldson said.

No, not quite the empowerment I 
was thinking of.

During question time, VP External 
Affairs Vanessa Garcia asked, “How do 
you perceive our councils react to each 
other? A. Federal government and the 
state, B. as seven equitable governing 
bodies, or C. neither?”

I wasn’t the only one who was 
confused.

“Can questions be asked to ques-
tions in question time?” a senator 
remarked. Robert’s Rules indicated 
that it was fine.

Social Sciences Senator Colin King 
turned the questions of questions into 
something more philosophical. “What 
do you think is the difference between 
student empowerment and student 
leader empowerment?”

Really, they were going for empow-
erment after Kuga’s first introduction 
of it — yet all this empowerment they 
spoke of goes back to the conflict 

between the college councils and the 
A.S. council.

Marshall Senator Kathleen Maguire 
directed the difficult question to the 
question master himself by asking, 
“How would you, as a student leader, 
empower students?” She explains how 
she meets with students during office 
hours and makes a conscious effort to 
speak to people about the constitution 

and about A.S.
“I haven’t had 

time to empower 
students because 
I’ve been attending 

councils.” King said. Naturally, chaos 
ensued, so council moved on to the 
Reports of Members.

The subsequent two hours con-
sisted of back and forth amendments 
to amendments, of which A.S. Advisor 
and Daily Operations Manager  
Hayley Weddle summed up my feel-
ings entirely, “You can’t make amend-
ments to amendments … or else it just 
gets too Inception-y.”

The back-and-forth amendments 
felt like Inception. VP Finance Sean 
O’Neal voiced my own thoughts: “Can 
we move the conversation forward 
and not talk about this amendment for 
three hours?” 

Maguire then brought up what stu-
dents who attended her office hours 
said in regards to the A.S. Council and 
college council conflict — “They [A.S.] 
are buttholes. Whose voice are you 
representing, other than your own?”

Strong language aside, she makes 
a point. 

“I could spend all of my term to 
have A.S. spend money on a naked 
rave,” Maguire said.

Hold on there. Naked rave? What? 
“Even though there was a lot of 

time put into something doesn’t mean 
it’s good,” Maguire finished before she 
was called out for being germane.

UCSD undergraduates can earn a

never changed hands. This means that 
they are still paying the same 1975 tax 
levels as when the proposition first 
passed. Due to this alleged loophole, 
the state is losing out on at least $6 
billion in tax revenue every year. 

On its official Fund the UC web-
page, UCSA said that the effects 
of Proposition 13 exacerbates 
California’s economic crisis and nega-
tively impacts the UC campuses as 
budget cuts and tripled tuition rates 
take their toll on students.

According to their website, the 
UCSA and its allies are pushing for 
a ballot initiative in 2016 to amend 
Proposition 13. They seek to remove 
the cap on commercial property taxes 
to restore the $6 million of funding 
back into California and the educa-
tion system. Since 2011, they have 
called on all UC students to organize 
in support of Fund the UC. Efforts 
include educational sessions and a 
postcard campaign at UCSD to raise 
awareness for reforms.

The UCSA, founded in 1968, 
has dedicated itself to upholding 

California’s Master Plan for Higher 
Education and fighting for the “access, 
affordability and quality of UC educa-
tion,” in accordance with its mission 
statement. Along with Fund the UC, 
its other projects include IGNITE, 
Fossil Free UC and Proposition 30 
campaigns.

Kevin Faulconer cruised to victory in Tuesday’s elec-tion to elect a new full-time 
mayor for the city of San Diego, 
and with Faulconer came a sense 
of resolution to the whole mayor 
revolving-door game.

With the councilman’s win over 
his city council colleague Democrat 
David Alvarez, the Republican 
Faulconer is set to become the 
fourth person to serve as mayor 
within the past 16 months. Now, 
America’s finest city has an oppor-
tunity to finally settle down and 
work toward resolving the Barrio 
Logan debate, saving the Chargers, 
creating jobs for UCSD alumni and 
cleaning up La Jolla’s smelly bird 
poop problem.

Faulconer told a crowd of his 
supporters Tuesday night that party 
politics shouldn’t define this city’s 
operations, and reminded them “it’s 
about us being San Diegans.”

That mantra will be critical for a 
city weary of weak leadership from 

a city hall whose mayoral job is 
“non-partisan” while the city coun-
cil is controlled by Democrats. Just 
saying the words “Bob” and “Filner” 
next to each other invokes negative 
feelings about local leadership as 
the former congressman’s short stint 
as mayor was marred by scandal 
and stubbornness to work with the 
tourism industry, among others.

We’re concerned that willing-
ness to work with members who 
disagree with him may not one 
of Faulconer’s stronger attributes. 
With the current San Diego City 
Council split 5–4 in favor of 
Democrats (Faulconer will likely be 
replaced by a GOP member), the 
new mayor will need to be able to 
bridge the partisan divide in order 
to make progress and get legislation 
passed while in office.

If Faulconer is as dedicated 
to bipartisanship as he says he is, 
then the city will be able to fluidly 
address the pressing issues that 2014 
and beyond will bring to San Diego.

Gov. Jerry Brown declared a 
drought in California and San 
Diego is not immune to the lack 
of rainfall or water. Mayor-elect 
Faulconer will need to prioritize 
addressing the water shortages as 
soon as he takes office because 
water is a necessity for all San 
Diegans and not a partisan issue.

Additionally, Faulconer will 
have his feet wet this summer when 
San Diegans will go to the polls to 
vote on two referenda this June. 
One proposition would reset talks 
on the Barrio Logan industrial 
rezoning, and the other concerns a 
linkage fee tax on new businesses 
that pays for affordable housing 
units. Watching Faulconer as he 
responds to big city issues that 
divide voters and constituents will 
paint a real picture of what this 
mayor is all about.

The UCSD Guardian wishes 
Faulconer luck with his new digs 
and that he’ll stay true to his goals 
for office.

Fighting Fire
Dissatisfied students should look to one of  the many safe avenues of  protest to

 voice their displeasure with university policies and changes.

ILLUSTRATION BY JESSICA CHEE

Our campus may seem a bit sleepy, but setting fire to Price Center is certainly not the way to wake it up. Police have arrested the suspects behind last December’s arson case — two UCSD students who may have been protesting University Center Advisory Board’s decision to replace the fair trade Espresso Roma with a 
Starbucks. But regardless of their motives, the suspects’ actions were in the wrong direction completely.

Now, we’re all for liberating the student voice and advocating free speech on campus, but arson is pretty far 
removed from the average picket sign protest on Library Walk. The suspects started two fires in two different Price 
Center restrooms and endangered hundreds of students, faculty and staff. Fortunately, none of the hundreds of stu-
dents in Price Center were harmed and both fires were quickly extinguished. 

We can’t help but take issue with both the crime and its purported motive. It doesn’t take a rocket physicist (or 
any educated university student) to know that setting a fire in a crowded place could injure or even kill people. That

Back Up
Now or 
Pay Up 
Later

technically
 speaking

As everyone’s midterm hell weeks continue, I’m going to warn you now that you 
better back up your files or pay up. 
Because these days, losing every-
thing on your hard drive will not 
only break your heart and piggy 
bank — it will also make you lose 
your mind.

Considering that I’m closer 
to my MacBook Pro than I am to 
most of my best friends and family, 
I felt betrayed when its hard drive 
randomly died during Week 3. I 
was so depressed that no amount 
of red velvet Sprinkles cupcakes 
would have made me feel better. 

According to Dave from the 
Fashion Valley Apple Store, a 
hard drive failure could have been 
caused by anything; moving my 
laptop while it was powered on, 
putting my laptop in a backpack 
or basically everything that you’re 
supposed to be able to do with a 
laptop, can kill a hard drive.

The shitty piece of metal that 
stores basically everything in your 
life rely on two highly sensitive, 
constantly spinning little “heads” 
that read and write data onto the 
drive. If these heads become mis-
aligned or dislodged from any heat 
or tiny vibration at any point while 
using your laptop, it’s pretty much 
time to cry.

I don’t know what I raged about 
more: The fact that I lost all the 
photos and documents from the 
past two years of my life or the fact 
that after only two years of use, I 
had to pay big money to fix it. The 
Genius Bar charges a ridiculous 
$180 for replacement and installa-
tion of the same type of mediocre 
hard drive. Even the Geek Squad 
counter at Best Buy charges $50 
just for installing a replacement 
(which you still need to buy your-
self), a job that requires not much 
more than 10 minutes and access to 
a screwdriver.

Dave recommended a more 
reliable replacement in the form 
of a solid-state drive that performs 
faster and is less susceptible to 
damage or failure, but costs around 
five times the price per gigabyte 
of storage. Since I was desperate 
and definitely could not handle the 
stress from another crappy hard 
drive failure, I reluctantly agreed, 
bought that ridiculously expensive 
little box and bullied my boyfriend 
into installing it for me.

I’m happy that I’m no longer 
watching a sad screen of “dead-
hard-drive” gray, but if I had put my 
thousands of photos and important 
documents on my computer onto an 
external drive, or even my DropBox 
account, the disaster would have felt 
less intense. In that situation, I’d still 
have to pay for a replacement, but I 
would have been less overwhelmed 
about completing upcoming assign-
ments and happily accepted pity 
chocolate from my friends.

Computer companies probably 
should just use better hard drives 
to begin with, but take it from me: 
Instead of crying the night before 
your next paper is due, make it a 
point to back up your files. Save 
yourself the unnecessary stress, 
have a happy Valentine’s Day and 
don’t ruin good chocolate with 
wasted tears.

Through Peaceful Student Protest

this was likely over something as 
trivial as a coffee shop only leaves 
us shaking our heads. The fair 
trade movement that campaigned 
against Starbucks wants better 
wages for the coffee workers in 
South America and elsewhere, 
but we can’t imagine that burn-
ing down a building full of UCSD 
students does much to further that 
agenda. Apparently, the suspects 
(who seemed to have planned this 
incident out) did not stop to think 
about the safety of their fellow stu-
dents or the staff who would have 
to extinguish the fires.

It’s certainly a shame that UCSD 
students decided to go to such 
inexcusable lengths because they 
may very well have discredited the 
entire “anti-Starbucks” movement 
on campus. Individuals who have 
worked hard on fair trade policy 
efforts and advocated their cause 
reasonably will forever be associat-
ed with the irresponsible girls who 
tried to set fire to Price Center. We 
recognize that this was an isolated 
case that should not be representa-
tive of the entire group, but the 
event will inevitably be associated 
with fair trade fighters in future 
conversations.

If the incident truly was meant 
to spark a protest, it’s also puzzling 
that the suspects found it necessary 
to resort to crime to spread their 
message. There is no shortage of 
options on campus for students to 
express their dissatisfaction with 
administrative policies and the like 
— for example, students can author 
resolutions, stage high profile pro-
tests on Library Walk and maybe 
even write a letter to the editor at 
the UCSD Guardian. (A.S. Council 
regularly reads us.) With so many 
potential avenues of influence at 

their disposal, it’s quite ridiculous 
that any student would essentially 
throw away their career and future 
in such an incendiary act.

Even with all these possibili-
ties in place, some of the campus’ 
anti-establishment enclave may 
find a way to point fingers at the 
administration and complain that 
the “institutionalized” nature of the 
protest process doesn’t allow for 
expression. However, we suggest 
that those pining for a Berkeley-
style rebellion environment should, 
to be frank, grow up. Rather than 
trying to “fight the machine” or set 
fire to campus, it might be prudent 
for these people so bent on chang-
ing the world to attend lecture 
every once in a while and possibly 
even get a job. A UC education 
doesn’t come cheap — that money 
shouldn’t be wasted on an abstract 
and irresponsible form of protest.

Instead, the students should 
have taken a look at past protests 
on campus that have worked. For 
example, despite being blatantly 
insulted and offended by the rac-
ism of the 2010 Compton Cookout, 
the Black Student Union took the 
appropriate steps to ensure that 
African-American students are bet-
ter and more accurately represented 
at our school. Instead of resorting 
to anarchy, the Black Student Union 
worked well with university admin-
istrators to meet their needs. This 
cooperation culminated in the open-
ing of the Black Student Resource 
Center in the Student Center in the 
spring of 2013.

The moral of the story is that if 
a student feels particularly affront-
ed by a university decision, there 
are far better ways for them to vent 
their feelings and start catalyzing 
change. And most importantly: Just 
don’t set fire to stuff. It’s a felony.

We associate the 
word “Valentine” with pink hearts 

and passionate love, but its Latin root, “valens,” 
actually means strength. We also imagine that Valentine’s 

Day originated from Saint Valentine, a third-century priest 
who coincidentally died on Feb. 14, but it actually stems from 

an even more ancient Roman fertility feast. Saint Valentine did 
exist and was not just the patron of love but also the patron of 

beekeeping, fainting, plague and epilepsy. However, the holiday that 
we see so iconically loving now has always been swathed in red: blood 

from sacrificed goats and dogs, blood from the “ceremonial” whipping 
of women to increase fertility and the blood from the decapitated 
heads of martyred saints.

II. Virile and Venereal, PART 1
Lupercalia: the ancient, Roman version of Valentine’s 
Day. The fertility feast was also celebrated around Feb. 14; 
however, everyone would be drunk and naked (perhaps 
the unlinked connection to the past and present of 
Valentine’s Day). Rather than the cliche candy hearts and 
red roses, men showed their love by whipping women 
with the hide of slain animals. Usually a goat would be 
sacrificed, and then their skin would be dipped in blood 
before it was used. Women would line up in droves to get 
beaten, thinking that a hunk of blood-soaked goatskin 
would make them more fertile. In addition, couples sexed 
it up in a whole different way: The names of single ladies 
would be placed into an urn, and bachelors would draw 
out their “lucky” girl. Lucky, of course, meaning spending 
the next year copulating with each other.

Saint Valentine, who lived during Emperor Claudius II’s reign in 
Rome, is the one we allegedly name the holiday after. Valentine 
was a third-century, Christian priest who married people 
despite Claudius’ ban on marriage (the ban being enacted 
so that men were not distracted with distant lovers during 
military campaigns). He was beaten with clubs and 
stones, and finally decapitated, on Feb. 14 for allegedly 
aiding Christians in Rome. But it was before his death 
that he had written a letter to the jailer’s daughter, whom 
he befriended and possibly loved. The letter was signed 

“from your Valentine,” thus writing the first Valentine card 
in history.

The Guardian takes you through Valentine’s Day by 
the books, from its Enthralling past to the BUDDING 

ROMANCES OF THE PRESENT.

III. Virile and Venereal, PART 2
Apparently, Lupercalia was so romantic that France and England were 
struck with the same idea during the Middle Ages. Not the women-beating 
part, just the drawing a name out of the hat (thank God). The men erred 
on the charming side and would draw a heart on his sleeve, indicating his 
commitment to a particular love interest for the year. This is a possibility 
of where the notion of “wearing your heart on your sleeve” came from. 
However, if a man was displeased with a woman’s dancing and cooking skill 
and left her, she would isolate herself for a week before banding together 
with all the other spurned women to burn the drawn names (the women 
were then called “Valentines”).

The ancient Roman’s Lupercalia feast gave us the 
holiday’s theme of fertility — in which we romanticized into 
love, but they could have also been responsible for the naming. 
Saint Valentine’s perceived influence on the holiday is actually very 
vague, especially since there have been at least three figures identified 
with this name. In addition, there are many different stories and legends 
on how these fabled men have come to influence the holiday. Other 
than nomenclature and ordained sainthood, the only thing these men 
shared was their violent ends. Medieval miracle plays would depict Bishop 
Valentine of Terni brutally beaten, blood-splattered and then decapitated 
before angels took him away. That sounds like love.

Martyrdom was more common back in the day, and the Catholic 
Church honored them by creating St. Valentine’s Day. Later, Pope 
Gelasius I thought of combining its celebration with Lupercalia to 
“Christianize” the pagan ritual. Plus, they were on the same day. In 
the Catholic version, people had clothes on, but everyone was still 
drunk, and love and fertility were still abounded. During the same time, 
Normans celebrated a similar-sounding holiday, which could have been 
responsible for the confusion: Galatin’s (meaning “lover of women”) 
Day. The transition from fertility and martyrdom to love is further sped 
up because of Chaucer (14th century) and Shakespeare (17th century). 

These men romanticized and sugarcoated it, popularizing and 
altering the meaning of Valentine’s Day throughout Europe. 

Chaucer, in his “The Parliament of Foules,” mentioned 
that “Seynt Valentyne’s Day” is “Whan every foul 

cometh ther to choose his mate.” Similarly, 
Shakespeare said in “Hamlet” that: “To-

morrow is Saint Valentine’s day / All in the 
morning betime, / And I a maid at your 
window, / To be your Valentine.”

VII. Venerated & VeerinG, PART 2
When Hallmark caught wind of creating Valentine’s Day cards in 
1913, the holiday would never be the same with industrial-level 
production of the iconic cards.

VIII. Conclusion
If you have a significant other on Valentine’s Day, think 
about how love has conquered all; no more beating women 
and beheading saints — only the overdone Hallmark cards 
and chocolates and roses. If you are single, consider your-
self saved from this bloody holiday and its turbulent his-
tory. If you side on one side or the other, or just ambivalent 
to it all, Valentine’s day is just around the corner and on a 
three day weekend. Maybe it is just a little special.

Five years ago, Laura Marks lost her job in the financial sector to the recession. Naturally, she turned to her lifelong 
passion for theater to alleviate the stresses of 
unemployment, a transition that culminated in 
the play “Bethany.” 

Inspired by post-layoff anxieties, “Bethany” 
is a complicated drama that attempts to tackle 
the still-sensitive topic of the 2007 housing 
crisis but has difficulty grounding itself in real-
ity. The story centers around Crystal (Jennifer 
Ferrin of AMC’s “Hell on Wheels”), a Saturn 
saleswoman, and her struggle to regain her 
footing after losing her home to the recession. 

In her efforts to turn her life around, she finds 
herself squatting in the suburbs with Gary (Carlo 
Alban), a paranoid conspiracy theorist with a 
penchant for swinging planks at intruders.

With a sitcom-style premise like that, 
“Bethany” fails to really address the issue of the 
housing crisis (it becomes confusing whether 
this was the play’s intent at all) and instead 
detours into an alternately dark and jarringly 
blithe tale of the frightening depths to which 
Crystal is willing to go to survive. Because 
of this focus, Crystal is the only character 
who enjoys fully fleshed-out development; the 
rest of the cast are criminally underutilized, 
and Marks doesn’t quite know what to do 
with them. Gary, in particular, suffers from 
superficial writing, becoming an expendable, 
“fight-the-Man” caricature. Meanwhile, James 
Shanklin’s Charlie, a questionable motivational 
speaker, is entertainingly sleazy until the char-
acter takes a repulsive turn in the latter half of 
the play. 

One-dimensional characters aside, the 
play is partially salvaged by Ferrin’s powerful 
portrayal of Crystal’s escalating desperation; 
Ferrin is consistently strong until the final few 
scenes, when she (and the play) begins to lose 
credibility with the audience. In the last quar-
ter of the play, the task of suspending the audi-
ence’s disbelief is made increasingly impossible 

as the action dissolves into a bewildering and 
abruptly violent conclusion that takes Crystal’s 
moral ambiguity perhaps a step too far.

Though bogged down by a clumsy script, 
the staging in “Bethany” is very effective 
— light and sound are highlights of the 
production that accurately manipulate the 
atmosphere of key scenes. Noteworthy men-
tion goes to sound staging during scene tran-
sitions, in which the music blasting through 
overpowering surround sound fades to tinny, 
in-store pop as we cut from the house to the 
Saturn dealership. 

Overall, however, small moments when 
individual pieces of the production shine aren’t 
enough to gloss over the play’s jarring prob-
lems. That the story strays from its own prem-
ise and offers no insight on the housing crisis 
only adds confusion to a plot that already suf-
fers from a relatively short, hour-and-a-half 
running time. Cuts made from the original 
Off-Broadway version scrap crucial context 
that help justify Crystal’s actions, ultimate-
ly creating an unsympathetic heroine whose 
actions leave the audience disoriented and 
unpleasantly bewildered.

As if receiving the crown of a Pulitzer Prize for Drama last year wasn’t enough, Ayad Akhtar has found success in his series of works. With a penchant for exploring cultural identities in the Muslim-
American community, the writer of the 
2012 novel “American Dervish” and the 
Pulitzer-winning play “Disgraced” has just 
debuted his second play, “The Who and 
the What,” at the La Jolla Playhouse on 
Feb. 11. Focusing on women in Muslim-
American culture, the play follows Zarina, 
who clashes with her family when she 
writes a book about women and Islam, 
creating a rift between traditional family 
values and contemporary society. 

Guardian: What were your inspirations in 
writing the play “The Who and the What”? 
Were there any significant events in your life 
that influenced the writing?
Ayad Akhtar: I’ve always wanted to write 
a story about relationships in the Muslim-
American community. It came to me as I 
was in a cab; I was looking at the televi-
sion, you know the ones in those cabs, and 
there was an ad for “Kiss Me Kate,” which 
is based off “The Taming of the Shrew.” 
I think it’s a great play, but it just doesn’t 
respond to where gender policies are today 
amongst certain men and women. I real-
ized the gender policies in “The Taming 
of the Shrew” make perfect sense in the 
context of the culture that I come from.
 
G: A lot of your work deals with Islamic culture, whether it’s identity, religion 
or integration. What kinds of discussions are you looking to create with your 

play from people who see your work?
AA: You know, what I really want to do is create an absorbing experience 

for the audience. I want them to be engaged on many 
levels and whatever conversation they have after; I 
don’t want to convey a particular message. I just want 
the audience to experience, as deeply as they can, the 
story. I don’t think of my stories or my characters as 
exhibitions or items in which the audience comes and 
looks. It’s really about leading the audience to a place 
of union, if possible. The Muslim-American identity is 
almost secondary to the universality of it.

G: In “The Who and the What,” you’re exploring 
Muslim-American culture and intersectionality with 
gender. What was your inspiration to write about 
this topic?
AA: I’m a writer, so I sometimes write about writers, 
and [the main character Zarina is] a writer. The issue 
of femininity in Islam is a longstanding theme in all 
my work.
 
G: How was the reaction to your works in general, from 
your own community and the outside public?
AA: I think it’s complicated; I think some people 
appreciate it a lot, and other people feel like they have 
some problems with the way I’m going about it. I think 
there’s a lot of complaints amongst people who are not 
happy with what I’m doing — that I’m airing dirty 
laundry. But that’s what writers do: They uncover the 
larger picture of what’s happening in a community.
 

G:  How have you reacted to all this success and attention?
AA: It’s a learning curve. It’s nice that people are paying attention now, so I 
have the opportunity of doing what I’m doing, but with new scrutiny comes 
new challenges. What I try to stay focused on is becoming a better writer.

All those who asked, “What do 
you get when you cross The Shins and 
Danger Mouse together?” had their 
question answered in 2010, when 
Broken Bells —  a duo of Danger 
Mouse (the stage name of musician 
and producer Brian Burton) and 
The Shins frontman James Mercer 
— released their self-titled debut L.P. 
“Broken Bells” proved that Mercer’s 
and Burton’s unique styles served as 
perfect complements to each other, 
with an eclectic yet cohesive mash 
of funky, soulful, psychedelic and 
electronic sounds.

With their newest album, 
“After the Disco,” Broken Bells 
offers yet another paradox: The 
record bounces around musically 
but flows seamlessly all the same. 
They play up an eerie, futuristic 
sci-fi vibe, and feature an upbeat 
electronic vibe typical of Danger 
Mouse’s work in combination with 
the resigned ballads evocative of 
The Shins’ “New Slang.”

But Broken Bells also takes 
its sound in new directions. The 
vocals stand out in particular, with 

neat layering, snazzy effects and 
an overall sweet tone. And most 
notably, the music is, well, groovier. 
Contrary to what the title might 
indicate, “After the Disco” is not a 
disco record, and its disco influ-
ences are surprisingly minimal, 
with the exception of the Bee Gees-
inspired single “Holding On For 
Life.” But it’s nonetheless far more 
danceable than the previous record. 
Its dark lyrical themes of loneliness 
and heartbreak make it suited for 
a despondent loner with a little 
boogie left in his shoes after a long 
night of dancing. And in that sense, 
the album’s title seems apt.

In the album’s title track, Mercer 
sings, “After the disco/ All of the 
shine just faded away.” And on 
“Control,” he touches on the transi-
tory nature of life: “Nothing’s per-
manent in life/ So it’s useless to 
hold on so tight.” So it goes. For the 
time being, at least, it’s clear Broken 
Bells’ shine hasn’t begun to fade.

Contributing WriterThe month of January is infa-mously known as the dump-month for Hollywood’s gar-

bage films, right after Oscar con-
tenders are screened and too early 
for summer blockbusters. “Labor 
Day” was one of the better films to 
hit theaters in January, but that isn’t 
saying much, given its competition. 
Based on the Joyce Maynard novel 
of the same name, “Labor Day” 
was written and directed by Jason 
Reitman, known for his quirky, 
critically acclaimed, artistic com-
edies like “Juno,” “Up in the Air” 
and “Thank You for Smoking.” With 
“Labor Day,” Reitman departs from 
his well-known whimsical style 
and aims for an intense romantic 
drama with elements of a coming-
of-age story and a home invasion 
thriller. Unfortunately, these excit-
ing elements never come to frui-
tion. Reitman set out to make an 
Oscar winner, casting top-tier actors 
— including Academy Award win-
ner Kate Winslet and nominee Josh 
Brolin — as he hoped to release the 
film alongside potential award com-
petitors in December. But after poor 
reception at last year’s film festivals, 
Paramount shifted the release away 

from the Christmas holiday to the 
January rubbish bin, understanding 
that this film was a losing venture.

“Labor Day” tells the story of a 
depressed mother, Adele (Winslet), 
and her son (Griffith), who are held 
hostage in their own home after 
they give escaped criminal Frank 
(Brolin) a ride. This begins as a 
potentially interesting home inva-
sion thriller, but after a predict-
able case of Stockholm syndrome, 
Adele falls for Frank, and this film 
heads in the direction of a Nicholas 
Sparks story and eventually surpass-
es it, turning into one of the most 
schmaltzy romance films in a while. 
At first, Frank is helpful around the 
house, doing chores and cooking 
delicious food. It quickly becomes 
obvious that Adele is going to need 
him in the bedroom for something 
other than changing the sheets or 
washing the windows. This concept 
would generally lend itself nicely to 
a Lifetime Channel original film. 
The whole thing was a far-fetched, 
ridiculous melodrama.

Reitman’s direction and execu-
tion almost saves this film. There 
are a few rather tense, edge-of-your-
seat moments —  the first scene 

involves a bleeding Brolin coercing 
an emotionally frail Winslet into 
giving him a ride, and it feels like 
a terrifying setup for a thriller. But 
engaging scenes in the rest of the 
film are sparse. With an experienced 
director and talented actors with 
impressive IMDb resumes, “Labor 
Day” should’ve been a smarter, more 
interesting and more insightful film.

Unlike Reitman’s past films, 
“Labor Day” lacked flair, wit or 
anything that would have made this 
drama worthwhile. This film was 
simply bland and for the most part, 
very predictable. This film was cer-
tainly not an easy thing to watch. 
Like its namesake, “Labor Day” is 
a labor to sit through. The almost 
two-hour long runtime of “Labor 
Day” is punishing, and it is difficult 
not to get restless, especially when 
a significant portion of this film 
involves longing stares and doing 
banal chores. All of these dull and 
banal moments are filmed well, but 
Jason Reitman isn’t quite able to 
save it.

The UCSD men’s volleyball team 
remains winless on the season after 
falling to Stanford and the University 
of the Pacific last week. The Tritons 
fell in three sets to No. 8 Stanford 
on Friday, Feb. 7, then watched vic-
tory slip away again the following 
night in a four-set match against the 
University of the Pacific. UCSD is 
now 0–11 overall and 0–10 in the 
Mountain Pacific Sport Federation.

On Friday night, the Tritons 
could not keep up with conference 
opponent Stanford. The Cardinals 
scored the first three points of the 
match and trotted out to a 7–1 lead. 
Good serves forced mistakes from 
the Triton squad, and the Cardinals 
capitalized, winning the set 25–14.

UCSD took its only lead of the 
contest at 3–2 in game two, but 
three straight points gave Stanford 
the edge. Triton head coach Kevin 
Ring called for time when UCSD 
was down 10–5, but the team never 
gapped the deficit, falling by a final 
score of 25–16. 

Stanford continued to dominate 
into the third set and took an early 
4–1 lead. As the set progressed, 
Stanford delivered from the service 
line and closed out the match, win-
ning the set 25–16. 

“Stanford is one of the more well-
rounded teams in our conference, 
and they showed it in our match,” 
Ring said. “We opened game one 
passing well and took some good 
swings, but Stanford was very good 
defensively as well as in transition.”

The following night, UCSD trav-

eled to Stockton to face the University 
of the Pacific with both teams com-
ing into the match looking for their 
first conference victory of the season. 

In the first set, the Tritons found 
themselves with a 17–12 point advan-
tage. The Tigers made a run, but 
UCSD closed out the game by a score 
of 25–22 with a kill by redshirt junior 
and outside hitter Scot Metzger. 

In the second set, the Tigers took 
an early lead. UCSD battled back and 
closed the score to within one point 
at 20–19, but ultimately fell by a score 
of 25–21. The third (25–23) and 
fourth (25–23) set played out simi-
larly for the Tritons, leaving UCSD 
with their eleventh loss this season.

“We won game one and were 
very competitive in the rest of the 
games, but it was not enough,” Ring 
said. “There were a number of plays 
throughout the night that were well 
within our control to better execute. 
As we get better in those moments 
we’ll turn a match like this in our 
favor.”

On a positive note, UCSD 
received great production from its 
wing attackers in the two match-
es. Metzger and senior setter Mike 
Brunsting both had 11 kills, while 
senior outside hitter Nick Iorfino 
added seven as well. 

The Tritons return home this 
weekend with No. 5 USC visiting 
Friday, Feb. 14 and No. 3 Pepperdine 
University visiting Saturday, Feb. 15. 
Both matches will be played at 7 p.m. 
at RIMAC Arena.

UCSD Senior Goalkeeper Cohen to Pursue Professional Career

the experience.
“It was such a good experience 

for me,” Cohen said. “Now I know 
that I can play with those at that level 
and learned what it is that I need to 
work on and what things I can do to 
improve going forward.”

As a three-year starter for the 
Tritons, Cohen has used up his four 
years of NCAA eligibility, but the bio-
engineering major will continue on 
at UCSD for a fifth year to finish his 
degree and work on his senior proj-
ect. Cohen says he hopes to continue 
training with the UCSD team while 

finishing up his studies, although 
he would be interested in finding a 
Southern California professional or 
semi-professional team to practice 
with. Cohen said ideally he’d like to 
train with the second teams of MLS 
Los Angeles clubs the L.A. Galaxy or 
Chivas USA. Cohen said he would 
also be open to playing with the San 
Diego Flash. 

“Staying a fifth year complicates 
my situation a little bit as far as being 
able to play professionally,” Cohen 
said. “But being at a top school, I defi-
nitely want to finish my degree. My 
goal is to work really hard in the next 
two quarters and put myself in a good 

situation academically so I can focus 
on finishing my senior project and 
look at various soccer options.”

Cohen, who is in a pretty good 
situation to continue on in profes-
sional soccer, would be in good com-
pany. Former UCSD centerback Jared 
Kakura, class of 2012, went on to play 
with the San Diego Flash for a time 
and was on trial with MLS team the 
San Jose Earthquakes, while David 
Bakal, class of 2011 went on to play 
for the Los Angeles Blues, a USL Pro 
Division team.

Baseball Goes 1–2 Against CSULA in Conference Opener

complementing our pitching with a 
little better defense and a little more 
pressure offensively,” UCSD head 
coach Eric Newman said of the first 
two games. 

For the final — and most excit-
ing — game of the series, the Tritons 
traveled north to Los Angeles to bat-
tle the Golden Eagles at Reeder Field. 
From the onset, it appeared as if it 
would be another low scoring pitch-
ers’ duel, as both teams remained 
scoreless and hitless through three 
and a half frames.

The Golden Eagles opened up the 

scoring with seven runs on six hits. 
Facing a massive deficit mid-

way through the game, the Tritons 
attempted to rally back in the fifth 
inning but only managed to score one 
run. Looking to end the game early, 
Los Angeles scored twice more in the 
bottom of the fifth to go up 9–1.

But UCSD refused to give up as 
they slowly mounted a comeback, 
picking up a run in the sixth off a 
Golden Eagle error. Triton pitcher 
Cruz held the Golden Eagles score-
less through the final four innings, 
giving UCSD time to cut the deficit. 
In the sixth, the Tritons picked up an 
impressive six runs on two hits amid 

Golden Eagles pitching errors.
With the game nearly tied, both 

teams were anxious heading into 
the final inning but the Golden 
Eagles stopped the Tritons’ come-
back despite allowing two hits. The 
Golden Eagles won the hard fought 
match 9–8, putting up 12 hits and 
four errors to the Tritons’ 10 hits and 
single error.

The now 3–2 Tritons head back 
home to face conference rival Chico 
State in a four-game series beginning 
on Friday, Feb. 14 at 6 p.m.

No. 39 UCSD went 1–2 against 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rival and reigning CCAA 
Tournament champions Cal State Los 
Angeles last weekend. A home and 
away series, UCSD played its first two 
games at Triton Ballpark on Saturday, 
losing its first game 2–0 before win-
ning 9–3. UCSD dropped the rubber 
game in a close 9–8 at CSULA.

In the first game, three Golden 
Eagles’ pitchers shut out the Tritons 
entirely. Trent Zaks from the Golden 
Eagle bench scored in the second 
inning off a Triton error. Zaks’ run 
would be the only one scored for 
three more innings.

Both teams struggled to bring 
runners home, while UCSD had dif-
ficulty getting on base, recording 
only two hits through nine innings. 
The Golden Eagles had more suc-
cess putting runners on base, striking 
eight hits on the Tritons’ three pitch-
ers, five of which came in the last four 
innings. The Golden Eagles scored 
again in the fifth inning, winning the 

game 2–0.
Cal State Los Angeles recorded 

two runs off eight hits with two errors 
while the Tritons were shutout and 
put up only two hits and two errors.

UCSD looked much more explo-
sive in its second game, although 
the Golden Eagles scored three 
times off two hits and an error in 
the first inning.

The Tritons rallied back by mak-
ing the most of the Golden Eagles’ 
mistakes. Sophomore two-way player 
Troy Cruz scored an unearned run 
early in the inning and, with the 
bases loaded, Los Angeles pitcher 
Ryan Keller walked senior catcher 
Nick La Face to score second base-
man Spencer Frazier.

The Eagles would not score for 
the rest of the game, despite putting 
up seven more hits. And after a score-
less second inning, the Tritons scored 
in six consecutive innings while their 
pitchers shut out the Golden Eagles 
for the rest of the game. The Tritons 
won 9–3 with both sides putting up 
nine hits and two errors.

Senior goalkeeper Josh Cohen, 
the man who singlehandedly pushed 
UCSD into the third round of the 
NCAA Tournament with a diving pen-
alty kick stop, got a glimpse of the next 
stage of his athletic career at the end 
of January while on trial with Major 
League Soccer team the Philadelphia 
Union.

In the last week of January, Cohen 
was one of nine players invited to prac-
tice with the Philadelphia based profes-
sional soccer team, whose ranks include 
the likes of former U.S. National Team 
midfielder Maurice Edu. But Cohen 
— a goalkeeper who earned NSCAA 
All-American honors for his efforts 
in the 2014 — was not initially on 
Philadelphia’s radar. Luckily for Cohen, 
the Union was short a goalkeeper at 
the time, and UCSD head coach Jon 
Pascale was familiar with the coaching 
staff. After Pascale put in a good word 
for Cohen, UCSD’s senior keeper was 
invited the day before the preseason 
training camp was set to begin. He was 
put on a plane that night.

The camp lasted for one week, 
beginning Saturday, Jan. 25 and run-

ning through Feb. 1. On the first day of 
the trial, Cohen went through a fitness 
test and spent the remaining time going 
through two training sessions a day.

“The level of play was so high,” 
Cohen said. “Everything was a lot fast-
er; the shots came in a lot faster. It was a 

lot of fun, but it definitely took a toll on 
the body and was very tiring.”

Although Cohen said the level of 
play was hard to adjust to, he thought 
he showed well and learned a lot from

WOMeN'S  WATeR  POLO

Record-Breaking Weekend
Sarah Lizotte makes history as UCSD goes 2–2 on the weekend.

Senior utility Sarah Lizotte broke the UCSD women’s water polo career all-time 
scoring record at the Annual Triton 
Invitational last weekend where the 
Tritons suffered their first losses 
of the season. The No. 6 nationally 
ranked Tritons went 2–2 at the four-
game tournament.

UCSD started quickly against 
Marist College in the opening 
game of the Invitational, scoring 
five in the first quarter. Lizotte and 
senior center Melissa Bartow each 
contributed hat tricks to boost the 
Triton offense early in the match. 
Sophomore goalie Courtney Miller 
made seven stops which gave the 
Tritons the 16–9 advantage.

The Tritons faced conference 
opponents Loyola Marymount in 
their second game Saturday, losing 
6–7. Both teams exchanged goals 
throughout, but UCSD held on to 
a 6–5 lead late in the fourth with 
under a minute to play. LMU capi-
talized on an ejection to allow the 
Lions’ Alexandra Honny to score 
the tying goal and force overtime. 
LMU gained the lead in the first 
overtime quarter and held on to 
beat the Tritons. Sophomore defense 
Alexis Wieseler and Lizotte both 
found the back of the cage twice in 

the loss, while Bartow and junior 
attacker Jolene Guiliana scored one 
goal each. Miller tacked on another 
nine saves in the game, raising her 
total on the day to 16.

Lizotte broke the school record 
for career saves in Sunday’s first 
game against Cal State Long Beach, 
bringing her number of total career 
saves to 251. 

Julie Swail, part of UCSD’s 
Inaugural Hall of Fame class, 
Olympian and former captain of 
the U.S. National Water Polo Team, 
previously held the record at 245. 
Lizotte surpassed Swail’s mark with 
her second goal in the game.

“It’s a tremendous accomplish-
ment,” Lizotte said. “The record has 
been held by Julie Swail, so it’s an 
honor to be recognized alongside a 
truly remarkable athlete.”

Long Beach held the Tritons to 
one goal in each of the first two 
quarters and was ahead 4–2 at the 
intermission. UCSD answered after 
the break, first tying the game 5–5 
in the third and then cutting the 
deficit to one point after Long Beach 
jumped ahead 8–7. Still, it wasn’t 
enough to overtake the lead, as Long 
Beach closed out the game 9–7 after 
scoring in the final minute.

In the fourth and final game of 

the tournament against Santa Clara 
University, goals from Bartow and 
Lizotte gave UCSD an early 2–0 
lead. Held to just one goal in the 
second period, the Broncos cut the 
Triton lead down to 5–4. Both teams 
scored two goals in the third to 
bring the score to 7–6, but UCSD 
found the back of the cage four 
times in the fourth and won the 
game 11–7.

The Tritons will travel across the 
country this weekend for the Bison 
Invitational hosted by Bucknell 
University, but hope to take the 
lessons learned from last weekend 
with them.

“It’s hard to lose one to two goal 
games like the ones we did last 
weekend and not analyze everything 
that went wrong,” Lizotte said. “We 
took our losses as kind of a way to 
improve on the areas we need to 
work on, and hopefully this week-
end is a testament of our progress.”

UCSD will face Bucknell at 4 
p.m. on Friday, Feb. 14 in Lewisburg, 
Pa. to kick off tournament play. The 
Tritons will face five opponents total 
in the tournament, which ends next 
Sunday, Feb. 16.
