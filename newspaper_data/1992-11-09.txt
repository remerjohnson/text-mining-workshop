five·year sludy on lhe aging of the 
brain. 

NcuroscienlistS have traditionally 
worked on early bmin development as 
a separ:ue aspect front the neurologi-
cal problems of lhe elderly. Scientists 
are now considering the aging of the 
brain as a pan of a life-long process 
beginning with lhe fonnation of a 
single cell and lasting until death. 

According to Dr. Fred Gage, 
UCSD professorof neW'OSCiencesand 
d ireclor of the research program. prin-
ciples of how the brain first develops 
can be used to study brain disease. 

"It is critical to understand lhe 
sequence of events Ihru occurs during 
[brJinl development, lhe process of 
aging and diseao;e," he said. 

The program will educ:ue both 
physicians and rese:m:hers about new 
techniques llsed to study neurological 
problems. While in the program, ,til-

Ahhough lhe majority of Ihe A.S.

But Jones said these claims are un-

It's interesting what happens when you give extraordinary people an extraordi-
nary amount of autonomy and upport, 

They innovate like crazy. Then their company takes off and grows like very few 
others have. 

Casein point: San Diego's own QUALCOMM. We've gone from 8 employees in 
1985 to over 750 today. That makes us one of America's fastest growing high-tech 
companies. 

It also doesn't hurt to have the company launched by communications visionaries 
like Dr. Irwin M. Jacob and Dr. Andrew J. Viteroi. 

TIle trick, of course, i to keep the entrepreneurial pirit flourishing despite 
phenomenal growth. Thai' why we give our engineers a much freedom and 
encouragemenl a. possible. This includes an open door policy company-wide, the 
latitude to set your own hours, the private space provided by your own office, and 
more. 

in response, QUA OMM people have pearheaded many of our indu try's 
most chall nging technologies. Am ng them are spread-spectrum CDMA digital 
cellular telephone ys tems, mobile sa tellite communication networks, HDTV image 
compression, full custom ASIC design, and more.

Are you 
religious? 

It 
Photos and Interviews by Jennifer Matthews 

I think religion is a feeble attempt to 
explain natural phenolnena, and a set of 
uniform rules to live one's life by. 
Jason Augustine, Muir Sophomare 

Religion is 
something m t 
people tend to 
practice_ I am a 
Catholic. 
Catholics have 
an obligation to 

attend Mass every week. Religion is 
something everyone should have. It's a 
good practice! 
Duy Nguyen, Revelle Freshman 

Because my 
family lives a 
busy life, the 
idea of being 
religious has not 
been real impor-
tant. Yet I do 
have certain beliefs in things that are not 
clearly defined. 
Kym Miller, Third Freshman 

I am culrur-
ally religiou as 
I live my life 
through and 
with my fami ly 
on religiou 
holidays. 

Cory Lidschin, Fifth Senior 

Religion is a 
question of soul 
and belief. I do 
not believe that 
religion can 
answer the 
questions I need 
answered, like, 
"Will I get a job after graduation? Will I 
be able to eat over the summer?" My soul 
- ifl have one - won't provide for me, 
so why should I worry about it?
