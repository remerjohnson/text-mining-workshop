policy idea 
Question now 
goes to EPC 

From a Guardian staff writer 
The Committee on Educa-

tional Policy voted unani-
mously Monday to recom-
mend blanket "amnesty" to 
all students who have 
allowed Incompletes to lapse 
into an F. . 

Atkinson 
ordered the . 
po~ice move

C ha n cell or Rich ard 
Atkinson gave the order to 
clear the Mandeville Annex 
of peaceful demonstrators at 
a reception last fall, but had 
no idea it would lead to a 
show of force by campus 
police. 

And Campus Police Chief 
Hugh French maintains, "I 
was just doing my job. If upheld by the Executive 

and Policy Committee and 
the full Academic Senate, 
students will have until the 
end of next fall quarter to 
make up work for overdue 
Incompletes. 

GUlIrdit", PllUlu by Phillip /Jovies 
"I received a number of 

complaints from people 
whose peace was being 
disturbed inside the 
reception," said French , who 
refused to name Atkinson as 
one who ordered him to clear 
the area. 

Ernie Mort, ReveUe Dean 
police committee member, 
attends to Tuesday's 
meeting. 

Their decision, a compro-
mise reached after weeks of 
l1eated debate, applies to both 
undergraduates and gra-
duate students who have 
allowed Incompletes to lapse 
beyond the one-quarter 
deadline. 

Current policy allows 
students one quarter to make 
up work for an Incomplete. If 
work remains unfinished 
after that date, the I lapses to 
an F. 

The CEP also agreed in its 
proposal that university 
regulations governing 
Incompletes will be "strictly 
enforced" on new IncQl1l.; 

·pletes to Bvei4 fu her 
confusion over the policy. 

In the past, some students 
whose Inc6mpletes lapsed to 
Fs were permitted by their 
instructor to make up work 
for a grade. . 

Now, students must have 
the prior written consent of 
their professor, department 
chair and provost to extend 
the one-quarter deadline. 

The rule will not apply to 
students whose Incompletes 
have already lapsed to Fs. 

CEPs recommendation 
will not be considered until 
April 7, when the EPC 
convenes. The full Academic 
Senate will then vote on 
Ere'. decision in April.

seem to vindica(e . Monty

(Officers involved in the 
Oct. 14 episode also refused to 
reveal who initiated the 
removal process). _ 

"As a result of those noise 
complaints, I decided to move 
them (the students) out. The 
decision to clear them in that 
manner was my decision, 
mine alone. I get paid to do 
that," said French. 

The students, after 
circling and chanting in the 
Mandeville lobby unhindered 
for nearly 45 minutes, were 
herded toward the door by 
police officers who gave no 
warm.. or elCpiaAation for 
their action, protestors and 
observers at the event have 
s~d. _ 

General outrage at the 
force and haste used by police 
officers when they cleared 
the students prompted 
Chancellor Atkinson to 
create ' a task force to 
investigate and recommend 
new procedures to govern 
police-student relations here. 

Tuesday, the task force 
was informed by faculty 
Chairwoman Dr. Joyce 
Justus that Atkinson had Just 
told her t hat "he was the one 
who gave HUCh French the 
order to clear the area. 

"He didn't teU the Chief 
(French) to let ten officers

SD' Transit : wants to curtail 
UCSD bus 'routes~ cut -#21 

$6 million deficit forces massive service cuts 
San Diego Transit, pleading that a $6 

million deficit is possible next year, has 
announced plant to curtail most of its bus 
routes by April 26, directing the most severe 
cuts at routes that serve UCSO. 

The 14 (La Jolla and Pacific Beach via 
Soledad Mt. Rd.) and 21 (Mira Mesa to 
UCSO) lines would be eliminated entirely, 
the 41 (Fashion Valley to UCSO) would lose 
Sunday service and the 30, 34 (both 
downtown to UCSD) and 41 would 10 eearly 
morning and evening routes. 

"(These routes) are all productive and 
growing," San Diego Transit Manager 
Roger Snoble say , "but we have reached a 
point where we imply cannot afford the 
luxury of financially nurturing these routes 
until they become as productive as the 
others throughout the sy~tem." 

Twenty ofthe 33 SOT routes are affected 
by the cutbacks, but UCSO, in a new, 
~owing area , will lose service on all its 
lines. 

The 41 will be cut back the most of 
remaining routes if SOT gets its way. 

Its Monday through Friday service, 
currently operating from 5:52 am to 10:19 
pm southbound to Fashion Valley and 5:45 
am to 10:10 pm northbound to UCSD would 
be cu t back to 6:56am to 6:26 pm sou th bou nd 
and 5:45 am to 5:45 pm northbound .d 

"Those are the times it just isn't 
profitable," SDT Planning Manager Rich 
Murphy argue . "We tudied every route at 
every time and some just pay more than 
others.

Reg Fee faces two

Funds intercollegiate sports, 
but won't add to daycare 
$31,500 goes to 
meet travel costs 

BY STAN HONDA 
Sports BcUtor 

The Registration Fee 
Committee voted Tuesday to 
approve $31,500 in new 
permanent funding for the 
Athldic Department that 
will enable it to avoid any 
program cuts because of 
soaring transportation costs . . 

Later, the committee 
rejected a department 
request of $16,000 for a full-
time sports information 
director. The vote was 6-1 
with two abstentions. 

Approximately 100 ath-
letes and coaches, represen-
ting 16 intercollegiate sports, 
turned out for the meeting to 
show-their suppOrt. 

The crowd waited for one-
and-a-half hours as the 
committee discussed the 
daycare request (see story, 
page 1). 

J'he request by the 
department was to make 
permanent the $25,000 that 
was part of the program's 
temporary budget in 1980-81_ 
The temporary funds were 
allocated by Vice-chancellor 
of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage last year' when the 
transportation department 
on campus increased their 
charge for university 
vehicles (used to transport 
teams to away games) from 
$15 a day per vehicle to $20, 
and from 11 cents per mile to 
18 cents. 

The effect on the program, 
s~d Judy Sweet, Athletic 
Director, "would be 
devastating. A trip to LA that 
would originally cost $60 
would now CXJ8t $104." The 
total increase for transporta-
tion faced by athletics 
amounts to 45 percent. 

Another $6,500 was 
requested to cover any

Says it wants a 
new daycare vote 

BY JEFF 
BERESFORD-HOWE 

Ne_ .... 
The Reg Fee committee 

Tuesday clenied a Daycare 
Center request to make Uj) for 
the loss of two CETA 

. workers eliminated by a 
Reagan austerity program 
and then voted unanimously 
to hold a referendum on 
daycare funding. 

The referendum, the 
second on Oaycare in three 
years, would leave Oaycare 
as the only Reg Fee supported 
agency that has had to go 
before a student vote to 
secure funding. 

In February, 1979, 
students voted overwhelm-
ingly to back the center. Over 
70 percent voted to support 
day care at or above the level 
of funding then provided by 
Reg Fee, and almost tw~ 
thirds said they supported 
ex~sion of the center. 

That year. the center had a 
waiting list of almoet 100 
students. Since then, the lilt 
has grown to alll108t 300. 
. The 1979 vote came after 
the Reg Fee committee voted 
to cut off funding for the 
center entirely'. When then-
ChanceUor William McElroy 
wouldn't intervene to rev~ 
that verdict, dozens of 
students occupied his office 
for three days, and 21 were 
eventually arrested for 
trespassing. 

The referendum was an 
attempt to defuse the 
situation by asking students 
what they thoUght about the 
problem. 

At the time, it was hailed 
by Dayc:are supporters as the . 
manclated end to uncertainty 
about .. Fee fundi •. 

But Tuesday's CETA vote 
tJrouaht the question bKk 
before the committee. '

It's time for economic revolution in US 
Editor: 

The United States has the 
world's largest industrial 
and ~icultural capability. 
WithIn the limit s of 
environmental good sense we 
can produce almost every-
thing we need or want. What 
we can't make, we produce 
enough surplus products to 
barter with for the goods of 
those who can. Wecan still do 
this with almost eight million 
unemployed and millions 
more under-employed . By 
putting these people to work 
we could create abundance 
for all. Instead we are 
runnin~ scared that what we 
have WIll go down the tubes. 

Thisisdumb. We need only 
to change some basic 
mindsets to create an 
economy of abundance. The 

chan~ need not be violent, 
but m an imperfect world 
change is the only answer. 

The. problem is this: All of 
our institutions - political , 
educational, economic, 
social, etc. - were created in 
an economy of scarcity. In 
order to achieve a better 
lifestyle in such an economy, 
ambitious people created 
these institutions to 
persuade workers to give up 
.-rt of what they produced. 
AI these institutions became 
Italic and more powerful, an 
ever Iaraer percentage of 
what wa produced went to 
the deva', the ruthless and 

" the .... y. These; maaten 

became convinced that this 
superior position was theirs 
by right. It was this very 
feeling of domination by the 
British establishment that 
lead our forefathers to come 
to the New World ; and when 
the old order tried to impose 
its will on the new, it lead us 
to fight our Revolu t ionary 
War. We were able to throw 
off their yoke. The Irish, 
3,000 miles closer to England, 
were not so fortunate. 

What we need are some 
new ideas made possible by 
the industrial, managerial 
and computer revolutions. 
We will always need the 
superior wisdom and talent 
of gifted , individuals and 
should reward their abilities 
richly , but we should never 
surrender sovereignty to 
them. No existing govern-
ment or business enterprise 
will give us this power; we 
must create it for ourselves 
by starting new institutions 
that will allow us to directly 
control the output of our 
labor. 

Such an institution might 
be The American.Revolution, 
Part II. AmRev II continues 
the power of freedom that 
once made America the hope 
of Lhe world. 

AmRev II is ' both a 
philo&oph~ and a business 
venture. The philosophy is :.:tie: people who do the

what they produce to contro\, 
operate and own the means of 
producing and d~tributing 
what they both need to liveon 
in prosperity . . 

When we own the means of 
production and di stribution 
we can price what we make at 
cost. If we insist on this 
ownership t he managers 
must come to us for 
employment, not t he other 
way around_ We gain control 
over our lives. The problem 
today is not how to produce 
abundance but how to 
distribute it when the money 
tool is controlled by those 
interested only in their own 
advantage. AmRev II will 
solve this problem by pooling 
the resources of its members 
to produce and distribute 

what they need through 
barter among themselves. 
AmRev II will be an economic 
revolution that substitutes 
production for use by a\1 

-rat her than for the profit of a 
few. 

Utopian? You bet! But we 
have to start someplace, and 
what better way to create an 
economy of abundance than 
by starting our own business 
enterprises supplying our 
own needs? If others can 
begin and run busines e , 
why can't we? Why do the 
work of others when we can 
do it for ourselves? The 
knowledge is available. The 
manager s are mostly 
employees like ourselves. We 
have only to agree to pool our 

resources and our talent and 
labor to become our own 
bosses_ We have always done 
the work and bought what we 
produced from those who 
owned the mean s of 
produ ction and distribution. 
Why shouldn't that be 
ourselves? 

This miracle will only be 
accomplished by people able 
to break free of past 
mindsets. The tools are 
there. They need only to be 
used in new ways. Those of 
us who understand the power 
of being in control of our own 
lives will be meeting at Che 
Cafe at 5 pm, Wednesday, 
Mar. II , to form the parent 
company of AmRev II . See 
you there! .

We can't afford apathy toward El Salvador 
Last week my sister called 

me from Maryville Missouri ' 
she' 21 and attend a smali 
state college there. We hadn 't 
talked in several months and 
busily brought each other up 
to date on our late t 
involvements. At one point I 
asked her, had she heard 
anything about EI Salvador? 
"No," _ he replied. "what 
about it?~' 

At first I was a bit shocked 
that she hadn't heard even 
w hat t he Reagan administra-
tion has been saying about EI 
Salvador. Then r reflected on 
my experiences of earlier in 
the week, and concluded that 
even here at (relative lv) 
sophi ticated UCSD there 
are many more like her. 

T had casually broached the 
s ubject to tudents before one 
of my writing c1asse . The 
response was about the same: 
hlank ace. unfamiliamy 
and (in mos t) a complete lack 
of in tere t. It did no good to 
att mpt to frighten the male 
st u?pnts QY warning that 
th II' next tr ip might be to . 
Guantanamo, Cuba . Th v 
"1erely yawned. ' 

:; SO has just passed 
t: trough a week of h Ightened

oJt endance at these evpnts. 
1 he earnest effort · of the 
ur panizer (CommItte In 
' () Idarity with the People of 
FI Salvador) dIdn 't accom-
jJ llsh much on thiscampus-

although certainly through 
no fau lt of theirs . Evidently 
most people just don't care: 
tudents are so concerned 

with midterms that they 
would rather ignore the 
slaughter of 10.000 people in 
a country the s ize of 
Massachu etts, committed 
wit h the aid of our generous 
donation of weapons to the 
people doing the slaughter· 
mg. 

r suppo e what alarms me 
most about this is that the 
Reagan-Ha ig propaga nda 
which paints a picture of 
riva l fanatics on t he left and 
right killing each other in a 
struggle to take over a 
"moderat e" government, is 
falling on receptive ears. The 
' ther day, for ) example, I 
heard a new. reporter on a 
student -run radiO &tatlOn 
confidently state that the 
leftists in EI Salvador had 
been proven "liars" by our 
own Defense Department -
an in titution long known for 
it scru pulous adherence to 
objective report mg. And now 
1 ee in the Guardian of Feb. 
26 that Harley Bassman' 
suspicions that the Interna-
tional Cummunist Con pi -
racy is behind the civil s trife 
are confirmed by (what else?) 
a "governmen t report. "

news media aren 't telli ng us.

They k.now that the army, 
the pollce and the National 
Guard - armed and trained 
by the US - are t he ones 
doing the killing. They've 
s ee n unarmed c ivilian s 
gunned down by uniformed 
soldiers (I remember one 
scene where a soldier, after 
murdering a man_ la Id his 
rifle next to the bod v , thus 
making the dead man a 
"terrori t" for the benefit of 
nearby news photographer ). 
They've seen mother unable 
to speak about their chi ldren 
who were abducted and 
beaten. and whose bodies 
were found days or' weeks 
later. They've seen refugee 
camp in San Salvador the 
capital. packed With peas'ant s 
forced to leave their farms by 

the government's American-
spon ored "land reform. " 
And they 've heard army 
com!TIander utter the policy 
whIc h govern s their 
unrelievedly bruta l action : 
every citizen i. a potential 
subversive, and the be t way 
to prevent people . fo rm 
becoming subversives is to 
ki ll them first. 

T hinking back on the 
inhumanity witnessed and 
described over t he pa t week 
I'm a bit ashamed that I tried 
to arou e the interest of my 
students by appealing to 
their dread of the draft. Wh v 
mu t we delay thinking 
about these things until war

outraged that the officiall y 

declared policy of the United

government friend ly to us, 
Wit hout regard to whatever

might commit against its

It's been a year ince the

continued from page 1 

While several ta k force 
members said they felt all 
along that it was Atkinson 
who asked that the area be 
cleared, Reggie William ,one 
student representativeon the 
committee, wa "s hocked" 
when he heard of Atkinson ' 
admission. 

"Until today, the thought 
that Atkinson might have 
issued the order was the 
farthest thing from my 
mind," said Williams, who is 
the AS commissioner of 
student welfare. "The day 
after the demonstration , 
students and other members 
of the university tried to 
ascertain who started the 
process and he (Atkmson) 
said nothing.

"And in media accounts , he 
con i tently said he didn '( 
know anything about it . Now 
he say he gave the order. 
Ver sliCk," aid William . 

But admini t rator close to 
the Chancellor say Atkin on 
informed the la k force at its 
first meeting that he had 
asked French to do some· 
thing about the prote lor . 

"The Chancellor recalls 
very clearly that he made it 
clear at the first meetin~ that 
he had issued theorder, 'said 
the Chancellor' s a sistant 
Bruce Darling. 
. Atkin on could not be 
reached for comment. I 

Justu s is the only 
committee member contacted 
by the Guardian wh 
remember ' "the Chancellor 

mentioning something about 
it. " and wa somewhat 
urprised when the other 

committee members reacted 
to the information with such 

I hock. 
Unfort unatley the execu-

tive secretary for that 
meeting, who take note on 
the commit t '. proceedings, 
was absent. so no written 
record of what actuall y 
transpired exists. 

In hopes of gathering "all 
the facts" relating to the Oct . 
14 incident, task force 
member ' asked French to 
participate in the nearing 
they have been holding for 
the past two weeks, said 
Justus. 

"We sent Chief French a 
letter, requesting that he 

te tify before us," said 
Ju tu. "He responded by 
a king why he had to come 
and what questions would be 
asked . I said it wa 
impo sible for me to predict 
what quest ions would be 
asked of him a members of 
the audience could also ask 
him questions." 

The committee" en ed a 
reluctance" on the part of 
French, · said Justus , adding 
that he said he could not 
appear on the date we had set 
and suggested that he had 
some free time during final 
week. The committee will not 
hold meetings that week. 

"The only problem I've had 
with appearing before the 
committee has been my 
schedule," said French, who 

is currenlly involved in labor 
relat ions proceedings. "] 
don't know why Joy ce 

Oustus~ thinks I'm reluctant. 
I don t reall y "want to 
comment on tha t. 

Bul 1u lUS, worried that 
French might refu se to 
appear, contacted the 
Chancellor regarding the 
issue. 

"I talked to the Chancellor 
yesterday (Monday) and told 
him I wanted the Chief here," 
Justus told the task force 
Tuesday. 

Since then, Ju tu ' aid 
yesterday, a tentative da le of 
Mar. 31 has been sel for the 
police chief's appearance 
before the committee. 

Atkinson is also expected 
to testify.

Committee behind in 
Insurance plan review 

BY LISA SULUVAN 
Staff Writer 

A committee formed last 
quarter to examine and make 
recommendations on current 
potential student health 
insurance policies has missed 
the aeadltne set by Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs ' 
Richard Armitage. In fact, 
committee members, who 
will determine which 
insurance policy will be 
offered to students here next 
year, have yet to examine any 
specific plan. 

" He (Armitage) asked to 
have them (insurance 
decisions) by the last week of 
Febr'Jary. but r don't think 
we're going to have them by 
that tIme, Student Health 
Service Advisory Committee 
(SHAC) Chairman David 
Ernst said Friday. 

Ernst labeled the deadline 
set by Armitage "unreasona-
ble," since co mmittee 
members were appointed at 
the end of Fall quarter, and 
added that t he decisions were 
too important to be made 
hastily. 

Armitage agree, and has 
given the committee until 
"early spring quarter" to get 
back to him with recommen-
dations. 

"I would rather they took a 
little longer and really 
examined the cons~uence 
of each model,' said 
Armitage. "I understand that 
they've just been getting the 
background on the present 
plan and I prefer a more 

~ frozen 
yogurt 

creations 

thorough study to a quick 
answer." 

A final decision on the 
insurance issue is necessary 
by May, when his budget 
deadline comes up, said 
Armitage. 

" There are so man~ 
options it's unbelievable,' 
said Health Center Ombuds-
person Dianne Rosenberg. "It 
would have been easier if 
we'd started at the beginning 
of the year," but committee 
members first have to be 
"educated" on the issues. 

Options the committee 
plans to consider include 
mandatory insurance, an 
80/20 payment policy and 
supplemental insurance 
plans , like the one now 
offered to UCSD students by 
the Occidental Insurance 
Company. 

Prior to the 1979-80 school 
year, students were automa-
tically covered by a 
mandatory Blue Cross policy 
directly funded by Registra-
tion fees . But Blue Cross 
refused to renew its contract 
last year after the company 
suffered losses of more than 
$100,000 

When Blue Cross disconti-
nued its coverage, the Reg 
Fee Committee established a 
pseudo-insurance plan, 
channeling $333,912 into an 
External Medical Account 
(EMA) to provide coverage 
previously furnished by Blue

For those of you who may have 
concern or are just plain old interested, 
some of 'yQUr elected representatives 
recently attended a leg islat ive 
Conference in Sacramento. NO'N, this 
may sound impressive to some and 
depressive to others, but in either case, it 
w~ very informatiVe. There were 
numerous workshops coocerning many 
aspects of political life, ranging .from 
basic organiution, to campaigning on 
campus, to legislation roN being 
considered at the Capital. 

In order to maintain your interest inthis 
article/ I'd like to share some info tMtwas 
discussed and is directly relevant to 
students, specifiailly coop housing. 

As 'yQU may have noticed, there is 
somewhat of a lack of student la.v cost 
housing within decent cistance from 
campus. One option we could strive 
to'Nard is "co-op" housing. "Co-op" 
houisng would mean that students 
would be responsible for maintenance 
and management, thus la.vering monthly 
costs. In order to begin work on this 
project, one must kna.v some of the 
viable options that exist on other 
campuses. Berkeley, for instance, leases 
6-10 u nit dwellings already built. Others 
have built pretty creative units on 
campus just by the hands and sweat of 
volunteers. Another alternative is to 
gather funds from variOus sources and 
b.uild another building specifically. 
designed for "co-op" housing. ,The ).ast 
but not the absolute final alterntlVe IS a 
dorm conversion project. This would be 
ideal In ord r to establish an elementary 
level .. rack record" So con rary 0 the 
b~II~1 thB co·co · houSing IS 10000Ing

Vice Chancellor Mile 
sees establishing a

as a "shift to meet the

"Every campus in the .

Reg Fee 
a'pproves 
travel $ 
continued from page I 
tation office asks for . If no 
increases are incurred in this 
area, the money will be 
returned to Reg Fee, said 
Sweet. 

The teams at UCSD are 
restricted more in terms of 
travel than any other UC 
campus, Sweet told the.-
committee. 

They are budgeted to go 
only as far as Santa Barbara 
and "to cut back (on that 
restriction) would make a 
mockery of the program." 
She pointed out that the 

sch~1 is bound by league and 
national rules to compete 
against certain other schools. 

Committee member Tom 
Hull said, "The bottom line is 
either cut teams or cur 
travel," in order to save 
money. "I'm not ready to 
make the decision to cut the 
teams." . 

Neither is Sweet. "How 
can I decide which team is 
more important than 
~not~er," and ultimately, 

whIch athlete is more 
important than another?" 

In terms of numbers, about 
] 0 to 12 percent of the 
student body participates in 
the intercollegiate athletic 
program, according to Sweet. 

"This [foes beyond just the 
athletes,' she said, "This 
includes volunteers, score· 
keepers , t e~m managers, 

students who volunteer as 
assistant coaches".and also 
spectators. Students (on the 
campus) are looking for 
something to rally behind." 

A fund raising plan to 
sponsor a sports summer 
camp here was outlined by 
PE staff member Burt 
Kobayashi. Currently, 
several independent grouJlS 
hold summer camps at UCSD 
in basketball, volleyball and 
other sports. 

Kobayashi is in the process 
of drafting a proposal for 
UCSD to have its own 
summer camps run by the PE 
department. The campus 
could generage up to $60,000, 
he said. 

The coaches also pointed 
out that the athletes 
contribute financially to help 
their programs. 

Nic Nedd, roach of the ski 
team, said the average player 
on the tea~ p_uts out between 
$450 to $500 of their own 
money to compete in about 
five meets. 

Several members of the 
crew team said they would 
'spend anywhere from a few 
hundred to almost $1,000 out 
of their own pockets to 
compete this year. 
, The athletes are "forced" 
to maintain the facilities due 
to the lack of money, Sweet 
said. 

The baseball team in 
particular spends much time 
on keeping the field in 
playable condition . 

Student 
Health,

• 

the pr~ent services offered 
here will also be presented. 

"I like the way the EMA 
works," said Dorthea Curry 
of the Health Center. Unlike 
other insurance plans, the 
EMA ~ar~ntees 100 percent 
funding · rather than 
requiri"4t policy holders to 
pay an mitial 20 percent of 
the cost. She said that this 
removes the financial 
obstacle for students who 
need proper care. 

EMA also funds most 
services outside the Health 
Center when a staff member 
deems it necessary. These 
include consultations with 

- specialists, lab test, maternal 
benefits and other care 
excepting hospitalization. 

Curry estimates that three 
to five emeraency calls Ire 
handled each weeknight by a 
staff member on dUty 24 
hours a day, and said that 
sometimes as many as 25 
calls are received over the 
weekend. 

"A major problem with the 
EMA," . Curry said. "is 
students not following the 
proper procedures as outlined 
In the student health 
brochure," UseofEMAfunds 
is usually subject to prior 
approval and does not extend 
the services provided outside 
of San Diego County. Dental 
benefits are also excl\lded 
from funding. 

Many students are 
unaware of the extent of 
medical coverage available at 
UCSD, Health Center 
officials believe.

U'CSD 
Superstars 

. . 

Last year at this time an 
obscure freshman from 
Torrey Pines High School 
completed his first-ever 
try at UCSD's Superstars 
~vent. When all the points 
were added up, Rick 
Wilbert had finished 17th 
in a field of 20. Except for 
maxing the point table in 
the basketball shooting 
event, Wilbert did nothing 
special in any of the other 
events. And, for that 
matter, doing well in the 
basketball - event was 
somewhat expected. 
Wilbert played guard on 
T~ PIlIeS' outstanding 
elF championship team 
two years back. 

So when this C's 
Superstars event n 
last Thunday, noonegave 
Wilbert more t han a 
second glance. After all, 
the real superstars in this 
event had already asserted 
themselves. Craig Kree· 
ger, Jim Senz, Gil Ruiz 
were all former champi· 
ons. And then there was 
Steffnie Bloss and Elaine 
Bergman who were easily 
the two best female 
athletes at UCSD . 
Bergman was a former All· 
American volleyballer, 
Bloss ... a world champion 
over·the-line player. 

The competition expec· 
ted to come down to a 
battle between these five 
with maybe a George 
McEldowney or Hal Light 
thrown in for good 
mea ure. Light and 
McEldowney are Super-
stars veterans and 
runnersup as well . 

Kreeger seemed to be the 
natural favorite based on 
his outstanding 5805 point 
total of a year ago. But 
Senz in his final quarter at 

With the high jump and 
mile run rescheduled for 
next Sunday at 2 and 4 pm 
respectively, Wilbert .has a 
solid leg up on the 
championship and a real 
chance at breaking 
Kreeger's all-time record 
of 5805. 

Even Wilbert seemed a 
little surprised himself. 
"Everything went right 
for me from the start" he 
said sheepishly. "I 
improved on all of my 
marks from last year, got 
lucky in the bowling, and 
hit the jackpot in 
basketball. " 

Some jackpot. No doubt 
about It. Wilbert can 
definitely shoot hoops. 
The shart·shooting 
IIOphomore canned 8-of·13 
from 22·feet in a one 
minute time trial to run 
away from the competi· 
tion. His mark earned him 
a near max 991 points on 
the scoring table, easily 
the top .mark of the 
competition. 

Even though Wilbert 
looks like a shoo·in for top 
point honors, you can bet 
that the other 20 
competitors will be 
showing up. Bergman and 
Bloss will both be right on 
his heel and in the 
process are destined to 
break Diane Ludwig's 
women's record of 4699 
points. Kreeger will be 
there too. The high jump 
and the mile are his two 
best events. And then 
there's Sehz who has more 
heart and competitivenes 
than perhap any of them. 

Tune in Sunday on the 
Warren campus track, 
folks, this thing cou ld turn 
out to be fun. 

UCSD was det.ermined the ...-------------, 
record he set as a 
freshman in 1978. 

Nobody and I mean 
nobody. even con ' idered 
Wilbert a a threat for the 
top ten, let alone the 
overall champions hip. 

So mu ch for expert 
opinion. Wilbert s hot 
those full of holes thi s past 
weekend with a steady, 
but tirring performance 
in the Superstars competi · 
tion' fir t ix event . 

Although , Sunday ' 
final competition was 
rained out, Wilbert, in true 
Bruce Jenner fashion, 
carved out a commanding 
lead with 4359 points. The 
next clo est competitor 
was McEldowney with 
4004. All of the rest fell 
neatly in line ... Rergman at 
3997, Bloss at 3985, Senz 
at 3942, Bruce Bri acher 
at 3912, and Kreeger at 
3906.

Los Pendejos hasn't been pushed yet and must be ranked as the odds·on

surprised everyone in last year's championship game. 

Brad Clark has assembled another excellent run-and-shoot club that always

Men's tennis defeats 
Division II team, 8-1 

BY SAMANTHA ROBY 
SUff Writer 

The Men's tennis team 
trounced Division II school 
Northeastern Missouri. S-1 
here Tuesday afternoon to 
bring their overall record to 6-
4. ' 

Going into their Tuesday 
contest. UCSD's number two 
dou bles team of Brad Driver 
and Dave Taber had a won-
loss record of 6-2. They came 
away with a seventh victory 
by defeating ·their Missouri 
adversaries. Carlos Norton 
and Rich Kielczweski, 6-1,6-
3. 

In the first set, Norton! 
Kielczewski never really got 
their footing_ The two didn't 
seem to be communicating as 
well as a doubles team needs 
to in order to play well. Their 
shaky stance was furthr 
weakend by the efficient 
execution , of Taber and 
Driver. . . 

The Missouri tandem was 
particularly vulnerable to 

shots straight up the middle. 
Taber and Driver did not 
hesitate to capitalize on that 
weak spot, winning several 
points by turning that 
weakness to their advantage. 
Kielczewski and especially 
Norton consistently had a 
tough time returning volleys 
that Driver and Taber 
hammered directly at them 
Norton aided the UCSD 
cause by mishitting several 
shots completely. Driver and 
Taber fed theIr opponents 
several unreturnable shots 
and servces and even came up 
with a few aces. 

Overall, Driver and Taber 
produced a smooth, well-
orchestrated effort. 

UCSD Coach Peter Davis 
was quite happy with the 
victory as well as the chance 
to get a "good match in under 
our belts before we take on 
San Diego State" today.

continued from page 9 
even harder, 13-15, 11-15, 15· 
11 and 5-15. 

The loss dropped the 
Tritons' record to 1-3. It was 
an especially tough defeat for 
UCSD to swallow since they 
appeared to be in every game 
except the last. 

Coach Steve Upp used his 
bench more than at any time 
this -s~son. In a surprise 
move, seldom-used Adam 
Cherry saw more action than 
starting setter Chip Yoshino. 
Also, Hal Light, another 
reserve. saw unfamiliar full-
time duty. 

"Adam did a super job," 
said UPP. who has hoped for 
better things from Yoshino, 
"and Hal Light played 
practically flawless ball. He's 
earned a starting spot on the 
team." 

A loss to an experienced 
USJU team, then. has less 
significance than if UCSD 
had gone all-out to seriously 
prepare for the season.

The past shapes present 
"Time present and tim4 past 
Ar, both present in time/ut"r, 
And lime /u tul'e contained it1 
time past" 
-T.S. Eliot , " Four 

Quartets "-
Alain Resnais' films have 

long been obsessed with time 
and memory. Hiroshima Mon 
.it mour, Last Year at 
Marien bad, Muriel, Tout la 
Memorie duo Motlde and 
others reflect his fascination 
with the past that shapes the 
present and th~ repository 

tha t aSSimIlates and 
proces es those memories -
the human brain , It i ' not 
surprising, therefore. that 
his remarkable new film , 
Mon Oncle d 'Amerique, is 
nothing less than the 
exami nation of human 
existence. This film tells me 
more about myself, my life 
and the society in which I1ive 
than any work of art I've ever 
encou n tered . 

Its professed goal is to 
make the audience aware of 
the forces that have shaped 

each individual's li fe, and in a 
stunning mixture of science 
a nd art i t s u ccee d s 
brilliantly. The movie is at 
once a textbook exrsition of 
t he theories 0 French 
behavio uri t Dr. Henri 
Laborit and a poignant , 
quasi·soap operatic examina-
tion of the quiet desperation 
of three people who are 
caught up like laboratory rat

upon t he ero-Magnon lines of 
domination and this is what 
it does to all of us, as Resnais, 
Laborit and screenwriter 
Jean Grualt show in a series 
of illuminating vignettes. We 
are constricted by platitudes 
and prejudices hoisted on us 
from birth . driven to

social pressures beyond our

Yet t hi s film i, no dry

a vital probing of the human 
heart in conflict with it elf. 
What Mon ·ieur · Re nai . and 
Grualt ha ve done is to take 
Dr. Laborit's finding ' and 
construct a film that revolves 
around the lives of Jean 
(pla ye d with uptight 
perfection by the dour Roger· 
Pierre), a director of the state 
radio network. lanine (the 
vibrant Nicole Garcia), who 
has an affair with Jean and 

. business dealings with Rene 
(Gerard Depardieu, who is 
getting to look more and more 
like Dudley Do-Right). Both ' 

13 

men are nervou~ wreck, 
ravaged by th competition 
while unable to reI a e their 
anguish in any ocially 
a eptable fa hion. Janine, 
though seemingly ontent in 
bU ' iness, is just a ' unhappy 
in her private life and in the 
film's crucial line of dialogue 
sigh!;. "Like mo!;t people I 
thought happines was. 
something I had coming tome 
like an inheritance from an 
uncle in America." Yet the 
mythical uncle can no more 

help our characters than 
their cinematic guardian 
angels that appear through-
out the film . Whenever 
Janine confronts a crisis she 
think of rugged Jean Marais 
overcoming all ob tacIes, 
Rene trie to live hi life in 
emulation of kindly Jean 
Gabin, while Roger admits 
that he has been faithfu l to 
onl v on e wom a n , the 
shimmering itnage of his 
. cree nhear l Dannie lle 
Darricux . 

The film offer ' no easy 
solutions and despi te some 
moment · of sur realistic 
hilarity. it is a sobering look 
at the human condition. Yet 
it is ultimately a work of 
optimism, an enlightened 
and enlightening plea for 
understanding of that 
condition.

Haxton, Len Jenshel , Joe 
Maloney, Joel Meyerowitz, 
John Pfahl and Joel 
Sternfield . 

Until recently, _black and 
white has always been the 
domain of the so-called "art 
photography." Its use ranged 
from the carefully controlled 
scenic shots of Ansel Adams 
to the spontaneous "catch 
the instant" people shots 
which Henri Cartier-Bresson 
made famous . In both cases, 
the photographer has 
complete control over the 
precise shading in the 
picture, from white through 
shades of gray to black. 
There is no color to distract 
from the content of the 
photographers. 

and deep blue water 
shimmering in a swimming 
pool. The orange glow of 
sunset is captured in its 
reflection off an odd·shaped 
tower behind the pool. the 
curves in the pool deck lead 
the viewer's eye on through 
the picture. 

Joe Maloney's pictures 
have a similar emphasis on 
color. The colors are not the 
bright colors one might find 
on post·cards or the poster 
prints seen on dorm walls, 
but they are the su btle 
changes of color and light 
brought about by the weather 
and the time of day. In fact, 
the subjects of his photo-
graphs are in most cases just 
excuses to show the deep blue 
of the countrYside before a 
storm, the greyness of a rainy 
day or the play of evening 
light upon multicolored 
autumn leaves. 

The photos of Jenshel and 
Stern field show the benefits 
and limitations of large 

format photography. As one 
can imagine. with large 
negatives you have a large 
camera, one which is heavy 
and not very maneuverable. 
Necessarily, these photo-
graphs are the antithesis of 
the run-and-shoot, sto~the­
action-in-progress news-style 
photographs. The emphasis 
IS on composition and color. 
The slow shutter speed 
necessary to shoot at dawn 
and dusk, as they like to do, 
makes capturing any 
spontaneous human activity 
next to impossible. As a 
result, there are almost no 
people in any of the 
photographs on display. This 
results in a definite static 
feeling in the photographs, 
and, I think, a definite lack. 

Sternfield's photos are 
mostly taken in California. 
They show slightly bizarre 
scenes from reallife t such as beached whales, the 
spaceshuttle perched piggy-
back on its launching plane 
and a deserted pumpkin 
stand with a burning house 
in the background. Stern-
field's pictures are techni-
cally excellent, and their 
static, detached and distant 
view lend a certain irony to 
the subject5_ But looking at 
them: I just was not 
convinced that this approach 
was the best for the subjects 
he presented. 

The Jenshel photos on 

New Images in color 
photography are on display 
in the Mandeville Art 
Gallery. Guardian photos by 
PhilHp Davies. 

The lack of important color 
art photography was not 
simply a matter of aesthetics, 
as much as it was a lack of 
technology _ Color photo-
graphs faded, and the 
chemistry of color film had 
not been perfected to the 
point where photographers 
could achieve the exact colors _ 
they desired in a lasting 
print. [t seems that color 
technology has improved 
now, if the number of 
displays of color photography 
is any indication. 

SOFT 
CONTACT LENSES 

What these photographers 
have found, also, is the large 
negative. The one technique 
shared by all of the 
photographers on exhibit is 
the use of a large format 
camera; the negatives are 
four by' five, or even eight by 
10 inches in size, The prints 
obtained from these nega-
tive ' are remarkabl y 
detailed, without the 
!'grainy " quality that 
enlargement usually have. 

The exhibit shows well th 
advantage and disadvan-
tage of the large format 
hotograph y. The quality

display also have a lack of 
life. In his ~hoto, "South San 
Francisco,' this lack is used 
to good effect . He shows a 
lifefess urban neighborhood, 
enclosed by telephone wires, 
The hillside above has just 
been razed, where new 
houses will soon appear. The 
hillsides are dominated by 
electrical power lines. 

But in another picture of 
his, that of a bol)fire, the 
limitations of style show. 
The purpose of the photo 
seems to be that of capturing 
the colors of a bonfire in the 
evening sky. There are people 
in this photo, but what are 
they doing? They seem to be 
standing on a lawn in the 
background looking to see 
just what the photographer 
with tne big camera is doing, 
The colors are fine. but the 
picture lac.ks a certain 

spontaneity one enj~ys in I 
photography. 

On theother hand. it can be 
pointed out that "capturing 
that special light," which is 
what many of these 
photographers are after. 
takes just as much quickness 
as does shooting pictures of 
people, and it is only with the 
large format cameras (along 
with darkroom skill) that 
they can achieve the effects 
they are after. • 
_ On a different line are the 
photos of Groover. Brooks. 
Haxton and Pfahl. Haxton 
presents photos which 
contrast different types of 
lighting on the same subjects 
- which might interest art 
students, but are photo-
graphically not inspiring. 
Pfahl's photos are the most 
visually striking of the 
exhibit.

UCSD Gamelan music merges east, west 
BY JOHN WOLFE 

Music is a powerful force in 
the world. It takes us places. 
moves us and mystifies u , 
for we cannot always 

_ describe exactly what it is 
that moves us. Music mirrors 
us in all our attitudes, each 
reflection a spirit or feeling 
which represents some 
aspect of our times. 

This story is about an 
Eastern music. the Javanese 
gamelan music. a music 
whose appearance at UCSD 
represents one of the signs. 
perhaps. of the single. most 
penetrating event of our 
century - the merging of the 
two Great Opposites - the 
East and the West. 

This merging of cultures 
has already begun. and the 
gifts of the East - their 
philosophies . musics and 
religions - are va tly 
intriguing to u; we are 
naturally attracted to our 
opposites. Where Westerners 
are predominantly extrover-
ted. scientific and logical. 
Easterns are introverted. 
mystical and intuitive,

Music unifies culture with enchanting voice 
flowered from the very roots 
'Of the two cultures. Both 
cultures have conceptually 
excluded the other from the 
beginning. 

In these days. however, the 
exclusiveness of cultures has 

broken down. The fusion 
which is occurting (an 
observant walk about the 
campus will make the influx 
of Eastern influences 
obvious) may be the natural 
and evolutionary saving 

grace of mankind and may 
grant us a sense of unity and 
wholeness to replace our 
current sense of estrange-
ment, anxiety and fragmen-
tation.· 

and political attitudes, so 
does it reflect cultural 
consciousness as well. The
