Film Teacher 
SAN FRANCISCO, Calir. -
After San Francisco State 
University Cinema 
Department Chair Rohert 
Lewis announced that the 
department did not have 
enough money to fund a film 
producing class, the more 
than 50 students in the class 
opted to pay $75 each for the 
professor to teach the l:ourse. 
The department, whil:h is 
underfunded and overcrowd-
ed, canceled the class because 
it had to keep classes that 
were required for a cinema 
degree. Currently, there are 12 
professors in the department. 
which has 600 students.

A.S. Council 
Meets With 
Officials 
TALK: Chancellor, Vice 
Chancellor, Director of Parking 
'discuss issues with A.S. offic~rs 
By Vincent Gragnani 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD Chancellor Robert Dynes, 
Assistant Vil:e Chanl:ellor of Auxiliary Plant 
Servil:cs Jack Hug and Director of Parking 
and Transportation Services Greg Snee met 
with the A.S. Counci l last Wednesday to dis-
l: USS current issues a/Tecting UCSD's l:ampus. 

Chancellor Robert Dynes tirst spoke with 
the l:ouncil , addressing the problem of 
increasing enrollment and overcrowding at 
UCSD. He said that in the last two years, 
more students than expected chose to enroll 
at U SD. 

"UC D wntinucs to be even more desi r-
ab le than it has been in the past, and more 
and more students are choosing to go to pub-
lic Sl:hools instead of private schools," 
Dynes said. 

Dyncs sa id that while new Eleanor 
Roosevelt College housing will eventually 
help to alleviate the problem, he believes 
something needs to be done sooner. He said 
that the univers ity will have to either remove 
the housing guarantee for sel:ond-year stu-
dents or transfer students. 

"We're going to have to l:ut back on 
some of the l:ommitments that we've made," 
Dynes said. "It 's tough. We don 't want to do 
that, but wc have to." 

Commissioner of Academic Affairs Doc 
Khaleghi asked the chancellor about what he 
considers to be the most important of 
UCSD's recent accomplishments. Dynes 
said he thinks UCSD's decision to move to 
NCAA Division II athletics and the estab-
li shment of C. R.E. A.T.E. (Center for 
Research in Educalional Equity, 
Asse 'ment, and Teaching EXl:ellenl:e) - a 
plan that includes the development of

New Club Teaches About Career Options 
PROFESSION: Revelle 
dean chaired conference 
for campus professionals 
By Leena Shankar 
News Editor 

Though surrounded by more 
than 17,800 staff members on cam-
pus, students rarely think of a pro-
fession in student affairs as a career 
l:hoice. Now, a student affair ' 
careers club has been established 
on campus to educate students 
about life a ' a college campus pro-

fessional. 
Student affai rs professions . 

enwmpas the wide range of ser-
vices that students require in a w i-
lege envi ronment , induding resi-
denl:e life, academic affair ', career 
counseling, co lleg iate athletics, 
library management and many oth-
ers. Revelle College Dean of 
Student Affairs Renee Barnett 
Terry said that she feels the club is 
long overdue. 

"I've been at Revelle for five 
years and in my tirst year, when I 
talked to students, they didn't real-

ize that student affairs is a profes-
sion, and that there is a definite 
l:areer path," Barnell Terry said. 

Patty Mahaffey, the assistant 
dean of Muir college, al 0 said that 
students often d not l:Onsider tu-
dent affairs jobs as careers. 

"Students don 't realize that the 
job I do is a career," she said. "You 
might be working with someone 
over in Career Services Center but 
never think oflhat as their career ... 
it's really funny actually." 

Katherine Benko, a recent 
UCSD biology graduate and cur-

rent minority undergraduate fellow 
with the National A sociation of 
Student Personal Admini trator 
(NASPA), saio that she helped to 
organize the student affair career 
club thi s past quarter in order to 
expo e students to the possibilities 
of student affairs professions. 

"A lot of students don't realize 
that they can tum this into a uc-
cessful career," Benko said. "Our 
main goal is to gather information 
and provide that information to the 
entire campus. We want to get the

students also visited 
ContInued frOM pa&. 1 

" We put our best foot forward 
today in representing the universi-
ty," Backer said. "It is a coordinat-
ed effort that the university should 
be proud of." 

Terri Douglas from Claremont 
aid she brought both her son, a 

high school senior, and her daugh-
ter, a middle school student, to 
Preview Day. Douglas said she 
found the presentations informa-
tive. 

" It 's nice. The time frames are 
good - not too long, not too 
hort," Douglas said. 

The 35-minute presentations 
included a freshman student panel, 
a transfer admissions/application 
workshop, an overview of the 
undergraduate colleges, intercolle-
giate athletics and presentations 
made by the different academic 
departments. 

Paul Saltman, who made the 
Biology presentations, said he 
found the parents and their children 
LO be very enthusiastic. 

''This is a great opportunity for 
young and old alike to get a Oavor 
[for the university J, to see the socia l 
and cultural diversity all in one 
place," Saltman said. 

Kyle Nai h, a sophomore at E I 
Cajon Valley High School , sa id 
Preview Day was useful in givi ng 
him an idea of how big the cam-
pus is, the sports offered and the 
types of classes available at the 
universi ty. He said he was not 
sure if he would be applying to 
U SD. 

"But I'll be keeping it in the 
back or my mind." Naish said. 

Other attendees were beginning 
to think ahout the university much 
earlier in their academic careers. 
This i~ the lirst year San Diego 

County middle school students and 
parent were invited to Preview 
Day. Saint John said that the 
response to this new strategy was 
positive. 

" We've had a wonderful 
respon e," Saint John said. ''There 
are several hundred middle school 
parents here. Several buses brought 
students." 

Tim Johnston, admis ions and 
ou treach associate direc tor, said 
that middle schools have become a 
recent target for outreach pro-
grams, as universi ty ad missions 
policies become harder. 

" We started the effort to reach 
out to middle schools ... (toJ help 
students and parents prepare early," 
JohnSlon said. 

He said that students and par-
ents should start thinking early 
about which classes to take, in 
order to be competitive for college 
admission. 

" We want to educate them [stu -
dents and parents I about what they 
need to do, what classes to take that 
will move them ahead, so they can 
start being prepared," Johnston 
said. 

Workshops were held for par-
ents and middle school students 
throughout the day. UCSD stu -
denls spoke to their middle school 
counterparts, while admissions 
offi cers Mary Lou Smith and 
Gayle Paisley made presentations 
to parents. 

Smi th sa id she found the 
effort to communicate with mid -
dle schoo l parents to be success-
ful . and did not expect the par-
ents to be as well -informed as 
they were. 

" I didn ' t expect those parents to 
ask the caliber of questions that 
they were asking," Smith said. 
" Whatever is going on in wmmu-
nicating with middle schools is 
working ... that parenls know so 
much that carly ... is very ~urpris­
ing."

Vigil to Be Held in Price Center 
All UCSD students are Invited to participate in a 

candlelight vigil supporting Jaturun Siripongs, a Thai 
national who is scheduled to- die by lethal injection at 
San Quentin Prison on Tuesday. Nov. 17. The vigil will 
be held in Price Center Plaza at 8:30 p.m. on Monday, 
Nov. 16. Students will unite all over the state to 
oppose the execution, which is the sixth to take place 
in California since 1978. 

Siripongs was convicted of capital murder and sen-
tenced to death for the murder of two victims during a 
robbery at the Pantai market in Garden Grove, Calif. 
However, his proponents say that there is substantial 
evidence proving his innocence that was not allowed 
to be presented during his case. This evidence 
includes expert testimony that Siripongs had cuts on 
his hands that were defense wounds from hiS 
attempts to stop the stabbing and the lack of his fin-
gerprints at the crime scene. 

Siripongs' proponents say that his case involves a 
violation of international rights granted in the Vienna 
Convention Treaty of 1969, because he was not 
informed of his right to contact and seek assistance 
from the Thai Consulate General. 

Organizers are hoping that the candlelight vigil will 
pressure Governor Wilson to grant Siripongs clemen-
cy. Both the Widows of the murder victims and the 
Thailand government have already requested that 
Wilson grant clemency. This event is sponsored by the 
A.S. External Affairs Office. 

Sociology Club Hosts Graduate

With a dangerous level of power and

struggljng nations such as Russia, and the

DANGER: 
America's power 
brings resentment 
Continued from .,.g. 4 
Russia is not going in the direcllon 
America has mtended it to go. 

After that smug lillie triumph 
over the Cold War. America has 
basically acquired sole. unchal-
lenged authority over the rest of the 
world. Our assertion that democra-
cy is the best system in the world 
has been relentless. and we ' ve done 
noth ing less than play the leading 
role in directing, developing and 
financing aspiring countries toward 
the American dream. no mailer 
how elusive it may be. 

Russia, of course, has been our 
key student. The country's resource 
potential. nuclear stock and over all 
bulk, could only threaten our posi-
tion of power should it successful-
ly reform itsel f in the absence of 
our all iance. The fail ure of our sug-
gested monetary reforms. however. 
have fueled resentment and re~is­
tance to Western prescription 
rather than trust and reliance. 

If Russia repudiates the west and 
seals off its borders, the United 
States wi ll be cut from any means of 
intluence. Based on Russia's rising 
trends of nostalgia and nationalism. 
the out look for Washington 's role in 
Russian affairs-looks bleak. Should 
nationalism actuall y take the stage, 
Russia shall indeed bet:ome a very 
isolated, hostile and angry place. 

ew reform proposal~ are not 
much more inviting. Of course, thi s 
present economic crises may over-
shadow the aims of politicians alto-
gether. therehy plunging Rus~ia 

into total chaos. 
America's level of power is 

almost dangerous. We've become 
the global pivot for all other coun-
tries. As such. we have tremendous 
responsibi li ty to ensure that every-
thing i running smoothly and, 
1110 t importantly, to ensure that our 
power is in cbeck. This ro le ha ' 
brewed what foreigners call 
American egoc:entrism. We've 
developed an arrogHnce that ;\c tual -
ly goes against our ideology - we 
beli eve our "fairness" to be moral -
ly superior to everything else. 

Clinton is hardly a model of 
integrity and. ahmm ... mora lit y. In 
the past six years, linton has 
threatened virtually everyone under 
the sun and has not rollowed 
through with one of these lofty 
admonitions. At tbe ame time, he 
whimsically casts countries in and 
out of his favor. Taiwan 's sovereign-
ty and diplomacy was dealt a harsh 
blow when Clinton shoved them 
back under China 's rule. Simi larly, 
most of Asia is sulking over thi s 
new U.S.-Asia relation. which some 
call a fre h crop of hegemony. 

The president shows little reluc-
tance in joining hands with one of the 
world's top dictatorship ', and po es-
s r of nuclear wea.pons. while tum-
ing the other cheek to his democratic 
counterparts. Right now. everyone is 
holding their tongue because the 
United States has so much power. 
However, this son or behavior is 
already beginning to gnaw away at 
Washington 's credibility. This loss or 
legitimat:y wi ll only prove hazardous 
for us down the road. 

The law of physics states that 
what goes up must come d wn. The 
greatest empires in the world have 

The UCSD Guardian 

evoked their own demise. The 
United tates has alrcudy demon-
strated a serious weakening of 
morals and fair play within and 
beyond its borders. While Russ ia 's 
fate is sti ll unclear. western reforms 
have inJeed been placed on the back 
burner. TIle most deadly outcome 
would be for Russia to rekindle it s 
desire 10 expand amI reabsorb its old 
territories through the use of military 
force . Fonunat -Iy. man)' repuhlic~ 
are quite content. and the economi c: 
upheaval hasically ove rshadows sig-
nilicant military take()ver. 

At the moment , t he outbreak of 
anart:hy due to thi s economic crises 
and the misplacemcnt or Russia's 
nuclear weapons poses the higgt.:st 
threat. Resentment toward the 
United tates is undeniahly alive, 
though certainly under wraps for 
the time being. We've hecome 
somewhat of that rich uncle that 
everyone hates but goes back to 
when in need of money. Should 
such a huge bulk of nuc lear 
weapons become disposable, there 
is no telling what would happen. 

The United States is ~teering the 
world in to a whole new millenni -
um. With this new, oddly contradic-
tory, allegiance with China, accu-
Illulation of foreign resentment , and 
the volatile threat or an old and 
sickened foe. implications for thi s 
new enl seem huge. Severely limit-
ed linandally, the most Washington 
can do is coax. tread delicately and 
wait. Keeping a low profile would 
be the most optimal suggesti on for 
America at thi s point. But then 
agai n. this would be telling us not to 
be Americans.

WITHOUT DEBATE, UCSD IS No MODEL SCHOOL 
Editor: 

In the wake of Speaker of the 
House Newt Gingrich's resigna-
tion, it behoove us to rethink the 
events of last June and Chancellor 
Dynes' "State of the University" 
address delivered last summer. 

1998 Commencement Speaker 
Gingrich is out of office. 1997 
Commencement Speaker Clinton is 
the subjec t of impeachment pro-
ceedings. Both men have t:omc to 
UCSD and gone, but the cri sis of 
mission and equal access to the 
uni versi ty persists. 

Over the summer, Chancel lor 
Dynes proclaimed that UCSD is 
already a 1110del for the 21 st-centu-
ry university. With a freshman class 
made up of on ly 0.6 percent 
American Indians, 1.5 percent 
Nrican Americans and 6 percent 
Chi canos/a~, UCSD might better 
be called an anti -model. Despite 
Chancellor Dynes' claims. it b 
clear that Washington policy insid-
ers at the highe t levels have little 
if anything to offer UCSD in terms 
of helping us to understand what 
kind of a institution we hope to he 
in Ihe 2 1 st century. 

Will CSD be a diverse. demo-
cratic institution dedicated to the 
broadest range of social and cultur-
al inqui ry '! Wi ll it be a place where 
the labor laws of the state of 
California are respected or one 
where they are nouted" Will it be a 
celebrity-driven finishing school 
for -the intemational elite'! Or will 
its students and faculty renect the 
population of California? Will it be 

a campU!, known for it~ outstanding 
arts. humanities and social science 
programs or merely as a high-tech 
campus geared to supporti ng cor-
porate research and development'! 

In our opinion, none of these 
question~ are receiving the kind of 
public debate they de~erve.

I would like to clarify the inat:-
curate facts presented by Sarah

Common Student" (Guardian,

an ax to grind is attacking the 
Associated Students, 

Fir~t, only the FOUR execu-
tives in the Associated Students get 
an upgraded parking permit. They 
still have to pay for their permit. 
The permit was instituted awhile 
back because of the number of 
meetings each execu ti ve has to 
attend. The rest of us all pay our 
share for a ye llow permit and deal 
with the same parking issues as any 
other student. We are not exempt 
from the "day to day inconve-
niences of the common students." 
rather we all suffer the same incon-

lead to missing a class for a meeting 
or an event that is directly for the 
benefit of the students. ow are we 
really being greedy? Most of us put 
our job before our academics and as 
students that is a BIG sacrifice. 

When did we ever whine or cry'! 
What A.S. C unci l i requesting 
from the students is to make con-
~tructive criticism with accurate 
facts. Constructive criticism is wel-
comed, because through your criti-
cism and your praise. the council 
works harder with greater determi-
nation for the students. Even Sarah 
Chu admits that "it is undeniable 
that progress has been made by this 
year's A.S. Council." 

How many A.S. Council~ do 
you know that have fought and 
received approximately 100 new 
parking 'paces for students'! How 
many A.S. Coundls have given 
away towels. T-shirt s. free food. 
key-chains and other promotional 
items to the students? We do so 
much, and due to th e fal se accusa-
tions made by student~ such as 
Sarah Chu. it prevents us from 
doing more work bet:ause we ha ve 
to clarify the truth with the r~st or 
the student~. 

The current 1998-99 A.S . 
Council li ves up to the expectations 
of the st udent s, and every day 
we're working harder with more 
dedication to accomplish more. 

I think it's important for stu-
dents to understand our job. For 
example. as a senator I attend col-

Rare Patriotism

I J1 regards to Brook Garrettson 's 
article "America Forgets the Value 
of Independence" (Guardian. Nov. 
9. 1998). he reminds us of some-
thing our generation has long for-
gotten. Although his expression of 
patriotism is rare these days. it is 
t:arnrnendable. Hi s attitude gives 
me much more hope and respect 
for our counrry than the kind of 
national "self-retribution" we ha ve 
been taught in many of our college 
courses. I believe that in order for 
true progress to come about, we 
must be inspi red by those very 
things that made this country great.

MEETING: 
Dynes di scussed 
admissions proposal 
Continued from pqe 1 
si ty have been the university's 
most significant recent accom-
plishments. 

Vice President External Kirk 
Matsuzaki asked the chancellor to 
identify speci fic efforts that the 
university has made recently to 
increase the enrollment of students 
from underrepresented groups. 

Dynes said that the university 
is forming relationships with 
schools that do not always prepare 
students well enough to enter the 
UC system. He sai d that through 
the C. R.E.A.TE program. the 
universi ty has already established 
partner hips with schools 'uch as 
Crawford Hi gh School and 
Sweetwater High School. 

Dynes said he was most enthu-
siastic about the 4 percent admis-
sions plan. Originally, ihe plan 
would allow the top 4 percent of 
seniors at each California high 
school admission to the University 
of California, provided that they 
have completed the required high 
school classes. 

Dynes expanded the proposal 
for UCSD , saying that he would 
guarantee admission to this cam-
pus for the top 4 percent of UC-
eli gi ble students for all high 
schools in an Diego and Imperial 
counties. 

The proposal is not ready to be 
put into effect. A UC faculty 
group wi II not act on the plan until 
thi s January. in order receive more 
input. 

Dynes said that the growt h of 

the universi ty would make his 
plan practical. 

"The reason why I believe we 
can do thi s is because we are plan-
ning to grow, and some of that 
growth will be those students 
ladmitted under the proposed 4 
percent admissions plan) ," Dynes 
said. "No one can argue that we're 
taking their slot becau e these are 
new positions." 

Commissioner of Programming 
Snehal Naik concluded the forum 
with Dynes by asking him how he 
was doing personally. 

Dynes said that his days -
which go from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
- start wi th a jog. He said he 
enj oys working in his physics lab 
and spending time with sludents 
and watching them grow. Dynes 
al 0 said that after several years of 
being single. he married fellow 
physics professor Frances 
Hellman last April. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Auxiliary Planl Services Jack Hug 
next addressed the council on the 
expansion of the university and 
the amount of available parking. 

Hug said that for the first time 
since he can remember. all park-
ing spots on campus were tilled 
during peak afternoon hours on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays. He said 
that in order to he lp address the 
parking problems. the university 
has temporarily added 104 addi -
tional spaces on Hopkins Dri ve 
near RIMAe. 

Hug then introduced Greg 
Snee. Director of Parking and 
Transportation Services. to 
answer parking-related questions 
from A.S. members. 

Snee said that Ihe parking prob-
lem may get worse during winter 

The UCSD Guardian 

quarter, when students tradit ionally 
use cars instead of bicycles. Snee 
said that an additional 100 spaces 
may be created hy stenciling new 
spaces in existing parking lots. 

Snee said that long-term park-
ing solut ions include a surface lot 
east of the east parking lot and two 
new parking structures . One park -
ing structure will be located on 
Gilman Dri ve and the other will 
be 011 the north end of campus 
between the Marshall apartment · 
and what is now north parking lot. 
Eleanor Roosevelt College wi II 
soon occupy part of what is now 
the north parking lot. 

Although the structures will 
increase the total number of park -
ing spaces campus wide by abou t 
400 spots, Snee said the area 
between Thurgood Marshall 
Coll ege and the new Eleanor 
Roosevelt College may experi-
ence a parking shortage. This pos-
'ible deli cit will be a result of a 
loss of parking spaces in the north 
parking lot due to the building of 
the new Roosevelt college, as well 
as the expected increase in the stu-
dent population. 

"Although we are building new 
parking, we' ll still have a deficit 
in that area," Snee said. 

Snee said that the new parking 
structures will cost $26 million 
and that all parkin g permit fees 
would increase between six and 
nine percent per year for the next 
few yea rs. He said that these 
increases will occur because uni -
versity funds are cannot be used to 
pay for the new structures. 

"Parking is a self-supporting 
enterprise," Snee sa id . "We're not 
allowed to use any sta te funds for 
parking.

excited by this work 
Continued from paCe 1

Benko said that she was prepar-
ing for medical school in her senior

mended that she consider a career 
in student affairs. 

"It was hard at lirst because my 
parents didn ' t know anything 
except medical school," she said. 
"[But) this field exci tes me on a 
daily basis." 

Patricia Scott. Eleanor 
Roosevelt College dean of student 
alTairs, said that she would encour-
age student s of any major to pursue 
her line of work. 

"I think that thi s can be a fi eld 
for anyone," she said . "There are 
probably people in this field from 
every academic discipline you can 
imagine. Many students who have 
assumed RA positions or OL posi-
tions ... if they enjoy that kind of 
work. that's what student affairs is 
all about :' 

"I enwurage them to research 
graduate programs in the country," 
she added. 

Students had an opportunity to 
learn more about student affairs

Barnett Terry said. "They also get 
to network and meet people ". there 
is un exchange of invaluable infor-

Benko, who attended the con-
ference in Santa Barbara, said that 
NASPA conferences give her more 
confidence in her career choice. 

"By attending these confer-
ences, I get the assurance that wow, 
this is the kind of life rm going to

Scott said that she was glad to 
have had the opportunity to attend

Beth Surrell, [he Career

that she lovas her job for the ener-
gy that tudents bring. 

" If students like the carp pus

in it, it's perfect for them," Surrell 
said. "There 's defini tely energy 
that staff can draw from the college 
environment." 

Benko said that she is al 0 real -

Salvation Mountain: Leonard 
Knight took fifteen years to 
create this three story high 
testimony of his faith. 

Not for outside San Diego lies a community that is out of this world 
bout three hours from San Diego lies 
one of the more fascinating and 
improbable sites in the country -
Slab City. Slab City is a huge squatter 
colony on the site of an old army base 
near eastern shore of the Salton Sea. 

The Army, Slab City's original tenant, pulled 
up the tents and buildings of a training base in 
the 1950s butlefl behind the concrete slabs they 
were erected upon . hence the name. The land 
the base sat on is now under the jurisdiction of 
the Federal Bureau of Land Management, 
meaning that almost anything goes in terms of 
who lives there and how they live. 

During the winter months as many as 3,000 
"snowbirds" come to this desert locale to 
escape the bitler winters or the Northern Plains, 
turning Slab City into a small town. Since the 
residents pay no laxes on the land and receive 
no publ ic services. they have organized them-
selves to provide for basic needs, like their own 
unarmed police force and mail delivery service. 

The best way to find oul the history of Slab 
City is simply to <lsk one of the residents. Dur-
ing the day score ' of people sit in lawn chairs 
chatting with each other; they are very friendly 
and welcome questions. 

The people of Slab City come from every 
walk of life: orne are well-off, as evidenced by

Managing Editor 

"Julia shows poor line motor 
skill in CUlling. I think she may 
need remedial help with scissors," 
my kindergarten teacher stated In 
my report card. 

While other kids struggled to 
read and write in elementary school, 
I had a much more embarrassing 
problem (to me at least). I couldn't 
cut in a straight line to save my li re. 
Art projects were the bane of my 
ex istence and I had nightmares 
about thick dotted lines. 

It took me years to reali ze that 
there was a very logical reason why 
I have so much trouble using scis-
sors. I'm left -handed and most scis-
sors are made for right -handed users. 

When my teachers stopped 
grading me on CUlling and I 
thought my worries were over. 1 
began to enjoy the nove lty of being 
left-handed. After all , being left-
handed made me a much better 
tetherball.player.

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES II 

THE EO/ITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Left-handeq student's woes aren 't coming out of left field 

Then it happened. [ got to j unior 
high school and right-handed desks 
became my mortal enemy. You see, 
there rea lly is no easy way for a 
left-handed person to use a right-
handed desk. In addition. being tall 
didn ' t help my situation. Invariab ly, 
I would wind up doing my best 
Gumby impression twisted into 
some sort of bizarre pretze l in an 
auempt to write on the right side. 

All through junior high and high 
school. I had thi s nasty habit of 
crashing into whatever was located 
next to me when trying to get out of 
my desk. Once. I injured my elbow 
when - in the process of exiling a 
desk - I tripped over a backpack, 
bumped into a nearby desk. 
bounced into my fri end Lissa and 
then sla/Tlmed my e lbow into a 
nearby d1alkboard . 

I thought my little desk problem 
would be over once I tatted college. 
On my tour of UCSD. I was over-
joyed to see that lecture hall desks 
were totally different than high 
school desks. In college, I though I 
would fi nally have a chance to 
spend the last few minutes concen-
trating on the lecture, a~ opposed to 
plotting out an exi t strategy fo r leav-
ing my desk. Little did I know. 

If high school right-handed desks 
are bad, college right-handed de ks 
are a thousand times worse. Their 

it ant. 
The reason for Kni ght 's fame 

is clear when you dri ve the two 
miles to Slab City from the near-
by IOwn of Niland. On the rig ht -
hand side of the road. about 200 
yards before the entrance to Slab 
Ci ty proper, is a sight ri ght out of 
Alice in Wonderland that goes by 
the moniker "Salvati on Moun-
tain : ' 

Salvation Mountai n is a three-
story- tall promontory that Knight 
has spent the last 15 years painting 
with a small brush. Using any paint 
avail able, Kn ight has created an 
amazingly colorrul testament to his 
faith. 

At the center or the mount, 
emblazoned wi thin a bright, red 
heart, is Kn ight's message for all 
to see: God is Love. The whole 

only redeeming featu re is that m l-
lege desks arc much ~asi 'r to acate. 

One problem wi th right-handed 
m llege desks is that there is rea lly 
no possible way to write in them 
without annoyi ng th e person to the 
rig ht of you. 

The second and more worrisome 
problems with college right·handed 
desks is that you always look Eke 
you' re cheating during an exam 
because your body is ti tled toward 
your neighbor on the ri ght. I can' t 
tell you how many times I've had 
panlnoid TAs and professor.. stand 
over me trying to ligure out why I' m 
positioned like a cheater even 
though I' m obviously not cheat ing. 
The ubservant TA, and professors 
usuall y real ize pretty quickly that 
I'm not cheating ur attempting to 
cheat - instead. I'm just one of 
those left-handers. The less-ohser-
vant TAs and professors usually 
spend the entire exam watching me 
fro m different spots around the 
room. [t's quite distract ing. 

By some Ir.lgic twist of fate, I 
seem to always wind up in classes 
held in lecture halls withollt any left · 
handed desks such as SoIlS Hall. Fall 
quarter or my freshman year I was 
lucky enough to have three classes 
there and this quarter I have two. 

[n lecture halls where there are 
left -handed desks. they are always 

side of the promontory is pai nted 
with trees, nowers, waterfalls and 
anything else Knight can conjure 
up. At the hase of the mount, 
Kni ght painted an ocean, complete 
wi th a small ishlnd and a little 
rowboat. 

Kni ght is adamant abou t Chris-
ti anit y, however he never pushes 
hi s beliefs on visi tors and ta lks 
about his faith only when asked. 
Knight said that he prefers to let the 
mountain do his talking. 

Knight is also a songwriter. If 
you visi t him, stay until sunset and, 
if asked polite ly, he will play some 
of his songs, along wi th many 
Hank Will iams Sr. classics. 

There is no entrance or admis-
sion fee of any sort, but Kn ight wi ll 
always accept spare cans of pa in t. 

See SLAB, Page 14 

all the left side of row and there 
aren't enough of them. Right -hant!-
ed people don't seem to understand 
that while they are perfec tly com-
fortable sitting in a left -handed 
desk. I am perfec tly uncomfortahle 
sitting in a right -handed desk. 

Why left-handed desks can 't be 
interspersed with right-handed 
desks. What did we ever do to make 
people think all left-handers have an 
innate desire to sit in a row? 

Being forced to sit in right-hand-
ed desks is not the only problem that 
I have to deal with - it 's just the 
most n ticeabk . Being left-handed 
also mean ' that fo r me doorknobs 
and potato pee lers are backward. 
notebooks bend on the wrong side 
and I have a nasty habit of elbowing 
people at the dinner table. 

As much as I complain , being 
left -handed a l~o has its perks -
especiall y in lencing. As an epee 
fencer l'or the UC D Interco llegiate 
Fenci ng Te:lln. I have a natural 
advantage every time I step ontO the 
fencing strip. Since the majority of 
pl:ople are right-handed, fencers 
usually don't get much practice 
fencing left -handers. As a result , I 
have un easier time winning houts 
against inexperienced fencers lhan 
my right-handed teammates. 

Another perk of being left-hand-
ed is that I am in good company. Bill 

Clinton, George Bush, Ronald Rea-
gan, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates 
are all left-handed. If I was stuck in 
a room with all of them we would 
have plenty to talk about. I wonder if 
Bill Clinton and Oprah have trouble 
gelling out of desks 100. 

Although it would be fun to have 
Clinton Feel my pain, I still dream of 
a lillIe place known as "Leftopia." in 
Leftopia, I would be able to cut 
along the thick dOlled lines, I could 
peel potatoes with ease and, most 
importantly, [ would always be able 
to lind a left -handed desk. 

Unt il that day comes, ri ght-han-
ders. I beg of you, if there are ri ght· 
handed seats available please sit in 
them and leave the left-handed 
desks ,IVailable for those students 
who really need them. On behalf of 
all left -handed students. I than" 
you in ad vance.

14 FEATURES 

MARY HIGGINS 
Senior Sta:ff Writer 

I'm so tired of all the perverted 
losers who hang around this school. 

If you've ever used an on-cam-
pus locker room then you know 
what I'm talking about. Almost 
every week a Peeping Tom is 
caught hiding in a shower stall or 
under a bench, watching women as 
they undress. 

When these jerks get caught 
they always come up with the same 
stupid excuse: "Oh, !thought ! was 
in the men's locker room." 

You would think thallhe dozens 
of naked women walking around 
might have tipped them off. 

Voyeuri sm isn ' t the gravesl of 
sexual offenses, but it's creepy all 
the same. ( myself confronted a 
Peeping Tom recently when I saw 
him hiding in the showers. 

"Am I in thc wrong placeT he 
asked, as he casua lly made a bee-
line for the exi t. 

"You're on the wrong planel 
pal." I thought to myself. 

It was unreal. 
Usually l'm a non-violent per-

son, but this was one of the three 

SLAB: 
Board tried to 
bulldoze mountain 
Continued from page 13 
Spending the night there or in near-
by Slab City is never iI problem: 
JUSt make sure to brtng a warm 
,Ieepi ng bag because the nights t:un 
be very cold. 

Abou t four years ago. the Impe-
rial County Board of Supervisors 
threatened to bulldozc Salvation 
Mountain on the grounds that the 
paint Knight uses might seep into 
the soi l and contami nate Ihe 
al ready polluted Salton Sea. 

The UCSD Guardian Monday, November 16, 1998 

PSYCHO THERAPY 
Test your knowledge of little-known facts about UCSD 

times in my life that I've been 
tempted to beat the crap out of 
someone. The more I think aboul 
that sick. lillie defect tht: angrier I 
gel. I have serious fantasies about 
using him as a punching bag while 
! do my best Jackie Chan imitation. 

However. my kung fu instructor 
has drilled it into me that martial 
arts should only be used in self-
defense. The Peeping Tom hardly 
presented me wi th a life-threaten-
ing situation, but ( nevertheless was 
strongly tempted to call out after 
him. "Come back here! I need to 
praciice my roundhouse kick ." 

What held me back in the end 
was nol my deeply ingrained sense 
of honor, but my deeper fear of lit-
igation. I' ve read too many stories 
about burglars who tripped over a 
palled plam and then sued the own-
crs of the house they were trying to 
rob. 

Well lawsuil or no lawsuit, I'm 
not pUlling up with thi s crap any-
more. 1 swear. the next time 1 catch 
one of these perverts I'm going to 
shove his sorry ass into a locker. 
slam the door shut and leave him 
there. Hopefu lly it will happen 
right before wi nter vacation and the 
jerk wi ll starve whi le I'm home eat-
ing gi ngerbread cookies and drink-
ing apple (;ider. 

OK, I'm through venting. Let's 
move on 10 more inspiring topics. 

Every quarter 1 like to motivale 
my reader with a little friendly 
competition. For example, last year 

The board was inu ndated with 
mai I and phone calls from 
Knight's many friends and admir-
ers and his plight became a popu-
lar cause for many in the arl world. 
Eventually. the board decided not 
to bulldoze the mountain. Salva-
tion Mountain is now viewed as an 
a,sel for promoting tourism to the 

. area. 

So, the next time you have a 
free weekend and midterms are 
not looming. grab a friend or two 
an.d head oul to Slab Cily and Sal-
vation Mountain. It is a short drive 
from San Diego and yet a world 
away. If you can, bring Knighl 
some pa int. 

I gave oul an award for "Most Eli-
gible Bachelor" and thoroughly 
humiliated a very good friend of 
mme. 

Gues, what'! II ', (;onte,1 lime

X-COUNTRY: 
Women finish a 
5th in tough field 
Continued from pa,e 16 

Despite the skepticism of oth-
ers, the Tritons were not to be 
denied from a championship they 
have owned for the past four sea-
sons. 

"We all were a little nervous 
before the race." Garcia said. "But 
when we got on the staning line, 
we started to feel beller, and our 
skills that we had practiced came 
back to us." 

The Triton men detinitely 
made the best of their three week 
break between meets. VanArsdale 
ran his runners everyday on ter-
rain that was similar to the course 
they were expecting at Chino. On 
Saturday, it was apparent that thi s 
preparation paid off. 

FOOTBALL: 
A intramural game 
for the ages 
Continued from page 16 
again. 

As the semnd hal I' progressed, 
our offense still couldn't lind a 
groove. The defense simply would 
not let us lose. however. It was 
bend-but-don't-break. Every time 
they had the ball inside the 10, the 
Box Curtain held . 

Time was running out as we 
prepared for our final drive. Our 
defense had stopped the Raiders on 
a crilical fourth-and-goal play. so 
we were starling the dri ve fro m our 
own I-yard line. 

"Everyone really stepped up 
big on this team," Garcia said. 
"Everyone factored into this win." 

On the women's side. Meghan 
Scalt ran a time or 19:02 to earn 
tifth place overall and to lead the 
women's team to a strong fifth 
place finish in a very deep field. 
Scott also earned herself a chance 
to race in the National 
Championships next week. 

"Earning a spot for nationals 
was my goal for the season." Scott 
said. " As a team, we were hoping 
to pull off an upset and win, too. 
But we are still all very happy 
with our performances." 

Van Arsdale praised the 
women 's team. 

' 'The women did a great job, a 
very well earned fifth place 
against some very tough competi-
tion," Van Arsdale said. "Rebecca 
Locken also had a great race. She 
has been ex tremel y consistent for 

There was no time for running 
plays now; we had to take Lo the 
skies. In an incredible di splay of 
toughness, our key receiver with 
the broken nose on the sideline 
would not be denied. He laced up 
hi s cleats and joined the fray. Thi s 
was it. There would be no tomor-
row if this drive ended in nothing. 
We had to score. 

After one incomplete pass, our 
speedy slot recei ver slipped under 
their zone. He made the catt:h and 
got out of bounds to stop the clock. 
There was under a minute remain-
ing. AnOlher small gain brought us 
even closer. The defense couldn't

1M Flag Football: 
It's Faaantastic! 

I am ~o sick right now. My 
stomach hurts, my head aches 
and I can' t walk very well. 

It could possibly be due to 
the large quantity of Wild 
Turkey (10 I proof!) and Sierra 
Nevada I consumed aturday 
night, but that's not the only rea-
son. 

I am sick of losi ng. That ' ~ 
why I had to drink in the fir t 
place. 

Every year, my Intramural 
nag football team, Liquor Box 
(formerly the Friars), has been 
highly ranked going into the 
playoffs, only to lose in the 
most unfortunate of circum-
tances. 

Every damn year, the expec-
tations are high , but we just 
come up ·hort. Last Saturday 
was the final insult . ow I am 
sure the gods f flag football are 
against us. 

In a game of epic propor-
tions, some say the greatest in 
1M history, No. 3 Liquor Box 
was scheduled to play No. I 
Rob's Raiders in the quarterfi -
nals. 

The Raiders were -0 and 
had been rolling over opponents 
all season long. Yet , the Box 
was in the midst of a four-game 
winning treak. The Box also 
had a secret weapon - heart. It 
looked to be a good game on 
paper, but was an even better 
game on the field . It would turn 
into one of the most exci ting 
Intramural flag football games 
ever at UCSD. 

As play began, the bad blood 
between the two teams was 
obvious. The hits were harder 
than ever and the play on the 
line was always a war. My team 
was already beat up, with our 
two starting cornerbacks on the 
sideline with a broken nose ami 
a twisted back from the tirst-
round game. The broken nose 
occurred when an oppos ing 
player led with hi s head on a 
block. Thi injury hurt us on 
both sides on the ball, as the 
injured cornerback was also one 
of our top receivers . 

Defense wins champi -
onships, and it ruled the day. 
The two most vaunted offenses 
in the league were stifled by 
some fantastic defensive play. 

The Box drove down to the 
goal line twice, only to be 
denied each time. There arc nu 
lield goals in Ilag foothall , so 
we got nothing for ur efforts. 
The Raiders were stopped on 
their first drive, but scored on 
the final play of the half. 

They got the conversion and 
we were in a hole, 7-0. Yet, the 
Box had been down before. We 
had clawed back in the tirst-
round game, and we could do it

Tritons at home. 

This year, for UCSD's women 's volley-
ball team, RIMA Arena has been synonymous 
with winning. The Tritons have lost on ly once 
thi s season on their home court. That loss came 
at the end of a very long four-game tournament 
against the top-ranked team in the country. 
Other than that loss, Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland 's squad has been unbeatable at home 
thi s year, with a 15- 1 record . 0 when the 
Pioneers took the court at this weekend" West 

Hayward. On Saturday, the Tritons 
beat Hayward, 15-5, 15-8, 15-8, to 

advance to the NCAA Division III 
Quarterfinals. 

The Hayward team was fired -up to avenge 
its three losses to UCSD thi s season. But in the 
cham pionship game. its entht.::.iasm was no 
match for the ecstati c Triton side. Just as they 
have been all season, the Tritons were ex treme-
ly loud and supportive for their teammates, 
often even louder than the rowdy fans . This sup-
port was ca rried onto the court , where the 

"They are so exciting to watch. You can tell 
that they are close and play for each other," 
Dederick said. "The teams in the past have 
played well together, but thi s one is different. 
It's like they want to win together." 

The Tritons pooled their resources and put 
together an outstanding win. Freshman middle 
blocker Kathleen Hentz lead the Tritons with

Bender, who had 8. Outside hitter Leslie 
Punelli also played fantasti·cally. Punelli , who

Triton Teams Shine at Regionals 
EXCELLENCE: Men's squad win NCAA West Region and advance to National Championships 
By Saul Sheridan -
Senior Staff Writer 

)1' you' re looking for an exam-
ple of how teamwork and determi -
nation can overcome the toughest 
odds, look no further than this 
year' UC San Diego cross country 
team. In an amazing, gritty perfor-
mance Saturday, the Triton men 
turned what wa ' supposed to be a 
rebuilding season into une of the 
best stories of the year. In an 
incredible upset. the men captured 
the NCAA Division III We t 
Regional Championship. their fifth 
traight, at Prado Park in Chino, 

stealing away a title that was 

thought to be a sure thing for ei ther 
Paci fic Lutheran or Linlield 
College. 

With the win, the Tritons 
qualified to race in the 
National Championships 
nex t week in 
Carlisle, Pa. 

"This is the 
sweetest regional victory 
J've ever experienced," 
Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale 
said. ''Their performance ', all 
seven of them, were a magnilicent 
display of team pride in a tradition 
of winning." 

The men all made greut efforts. 

Each of the seven Tritons finished 
in the top 38 in a 109-man race, 
induding a second-place finish by 

sophomore James Nielsen, who 
ran an amazi ng time of 

25:43. Also linishing in 
the top 10 for 
the Tritons 
were Franzwa 

Achie and Joshua Levin-
Soler, who recorded times 

of 26:40 and 26:44, respective-
ly. 

"None of the other teams really 
gave us much of a chance. The 
other coaches were talking as if 
Paci fic Lutheran was a 'ure win-

ner," Van Arsdale said. " It was a 
phenomenal achievement for our 
team." 

Player and coaches attributed 
the team's big performance to the 
tremendous crowd support of 
alumni . parents and students, who 
made their way to Chino to cheer 
the Tritons to victory. 

''The crowd support was amaz-
ing," said Nathan Garcia, who tin-
ished the race in 18th place with a 
time of 27:04. ''They pu hed us 
throughout the race, they wouldn't 
let us let up at any time. They made 
a big difference."
