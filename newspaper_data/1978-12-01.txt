Budget Cuts Could Close A Campus 
B, Erie JaJe 

M .............. 
The UDivenitJ of CaUfomta 

is now faced with po.lible 
budlet cull that could cloee 
campusea, medicallCbool, and 
eliminate department, and 
profel,or. tbrougboul tbe 
system. 

At stake, according to Uni-
versity pre,ident David Saxon, 
is tbe maintenance of tbe 
University" po,ition as a 
nationally prominent bigb 
quality academic iDltitution. 

Tbe University', pOiition, 
already weakened by post-
proposition 13 budget cuts is 
now critically threatened by 
GovenJOr Jerry Brown's state 
funding plan wbich could 

eliminate an additional 10 
percent from the University', 
budget, Saxon bas stated. 

The threat of a 10 percent cut 
arise, out of a November • 
memorandum sent by Brown to 
the University as weU al aU 
other state departments. The 
memorandum called for them 
to identify tbeir weakest 
programs \Vhicb, if eliminated, 
would add up to a ten percent 
cut in their state budget 
allocations. 

In his response to Brown's 
letter, Saxon detailed how a ten 
percent cut in the state 
financing of UC, equivalent to 
m million, would affect the 
University. 

To deal with the cut the 

University could, Saxon (Jtated: 
-Close one .eneral campus 

and a medicallCbool along with 
various other general cull. 

-Close two medicalscbools, 
make general cutbacu and· 
transfer the use of student fee 
program monies to make up for 
the loss of state support. 

-Close only one medical 
school, make general cutbacks 
and increase student fees. 

Saxon said that there could be 
other ways, or different com-
binations of the listed cutbacks, 
used to implement a 10 percent 
cut. But, he said, any cuts at all 
in the University's budget at 
this time would not be "ra-
tional." 

Saxon stated in his letter to 

Brown that the University was 
special, and therefore sbould 
not be expected to make any 
additional budget cuts. 

Brown, however, told the 
Regents at their meeting in San 
Francisco November 17 that he 
should be "taken seriously. " In 
connection with the threatened 
cuts Brown did not indicate 
what exactly be meant by being 
taken seriously." 

What Brown will recommend 
as a budget reduction for the 
University, if one is required, 
will not be released until the 
first week in January when the 
governor's budget for the next 
fiscal year is made public. 

In addition to the threat of 
Brown's 10 percent cut, the 
University is currently also 
involved in discussions with the 
State Department of Finance 
about wbether approximately 
$15 million cut from this year's 
budget was a, temporary cut or 
a permanent reduction in the 
University's base budget. 

This year, on the information 
that the $15 million was a 
temporary cut, the money was 
replaced by Regents' funds and 
from the financial aid reserves. 

If the $15 million cut is found 
to be permanent the University 
would be forced to cut it from its 
budget.

Vasconcellos -Speaks Out For UC 
By Jell Beresford-Howe 

ad Kadlleea Huffer 
The University of California, 

faced witb a potential $90 
milUon in budlet cuts, is "over-
reactin, to directives from 
Govel"Dbr BrOwn < oalce," 
Aaemblyman Jobn Vaaeon-
cellos said here yesterday. 

Though Vasconcellos, chair-
man of the Assem~ly Subcom-

mittee on Post-secondary 
Education, added tbat tbe 
legislature will be "tighter" 
financially than ever before, 
Academic Senate Chairman 
Bill Fruer, a UCSD Physics 
profet_o ,can~d Ii word, 
"one of the few reallUring 
things we've heard in weeks," 

Vasconcellos also told report-
ers of the statewide Academic 

Senate yesterday afternoon Governor cut from the budget 
that "We don't have unlimited last spring, which he has a 
funds, but I don't intend to see chance to restore in his Janu-
any campus close." ary budget presentations, and 

"We will not h a ve any the $77 million represented by 
additional (student fees) , but it the 10 percent cut Brown has 
is aU g01ng to be tight...new asked all state agencies, 
programs will bave to come out including the University of 
of current expenditures." California, to consider. 

The ~ver $90 million figure Vasconcellos ' comments 
represents the $15.4 million the were made at part of meetings 

- with the statewide Academic 
Senate yesterday afternoon in 
the Urey Room of Urey Hall 
and at a dinner with Third 
College students, faculty and 
staff last night. 

The' meetings will continue 
tomorrow with testimony on 

, interdisciplinary programs 
from faculty and students in 
Chancellor'S Complex 117A. 

The Academic Senate repre-
sentatives told the subcom-
mittee staff and Assembly 

member Marilyn Ryan, down 
from Los Angeles for three 
hours, that faculty salaries and 
the future of the University of 
California as a quality institu-
tion were major concerns of 
most professors tbroughout the 
UC system. 

Russ Doolittle, chairman of 
the UCSD Academic Senate 
division, told the subcommittee 
that "staff salaries have 
remained competitive with 
other systems while faculty 
salaries have lagged behind." 

David Cattell, a UCLA profe-
ssor and chairman of the 
Academic ~enate's Planning 
and Budget Committee, duded 
that "to be nicked year after 
year in tbe salaries is discour-
aging .. jf we're going to keep a 
quality university, we're going 
to have to have to cut back some 
programs to keep others."

Honors Petition Rejected 
Graduation Criteria Left at 140/0 

By Anita z. ...... 
A petition wbich recom-

mended a delay in implemen-
tation of the newly-stiffened 
criteria for student bonors at 
graduation (Gaardlaa, Oct. 11) 
was rejected by the Academic 
Senate Tuesday. 

The petition which was 
presented by UCSD student 
Rick Labowe and AS Com-
missioner of Academic Affairs 
MariO Tempereau asked that 
the honors criteria contain a 
grandfather clause so that, 
"continuing students ... be 
allowed to graduate under the 
requirements establi hed at 

the time of their admission (to 
UCSD.) " 

Tbe clause would allow all 
currently enrolled UCSD Itu-
dents to be judged by the old 
(unrevised), less competitive 
criteria. Under these rules, 
students with a GPA over 3.25 
are eligible for awards at 
graduation. 

The new criteria, however, 
will determine the number of 
honorees by percentage, with a 
new percentage determined 
every summer. 

Previously, over 50% of the 
graduating cia s received 
awards of cum laude, magna 

cum laude, and summa cum 
laude. This figure is unusually 
higb compared to other · UC 
campuses, as well as univer-
sities nationwide. 

The Academic Senate cited 
Irade inflation as the major 
cause for the large amount of 
students graduating with 
honors. They voted last year to 
revise the honors system, and 
over the summer decided that 
only 14% of this year's gradu-
ating class will receive award 
at Iraduation.

Facing today as the deadline 
for raising money, the Food 
Fight Relief Fund Committee, 
conSisting of four students 
caught during the food fight in 
the Revelle Cafeteria last 
Halloween, had collected at 
least $150 in donations and hope 
for S200 by later today. The fifth 
student orilinally held respon-
sible for the damage, Warren 
freshman Jordan Stonn, was 
tra,ically killed in a car 
accident over the Tbanksaiving 
holiday. 

The remaining four students, 
Carl Stolle, Clayton Brenner, 
Greg Russell and Jon Mooney, 
collected the money by ap-
pealing to involved but un-
caught food fighters while they 
dined in the Revelle Cafeteria 
or during dorm meetings in the 
Revelle Residence Halls. 

According to Revelle Resi-
dent Dean Judith Edwin , 
neither Storm's family or the 

other four food fighters will be 
charged for Storm's share of 
the $977 of damage to the 
cafeteria. 

The deadline was imposed, 
explained Edwin, because she 
and Revelle Dean Ernie Mort 
"don't want it (the collection 
process) to hang on into 
finals," in the hope of "wrap-
pinl up the whole food ficht 
situation by the end of the 
quarter." 

"I think the (four) students 
have tried hard," Mort said of 
the collection effort, "I 
applaude them on their effort." 
It Will DOW be up to the Revelle 
Council on College Affairs 
(RCCA), Mort said, throup its 
Housillll and Food Servicea 
ComMi tft~ t

the bill and how much, if any,

own pockets.

Says Finances are 
Problem for Dept. 
Editor: said, I honesUy feel that the 

athlete is beiDa cheated. I'd like to start of( by 
expressing my deepest ap-
preciation to both the G.ard1aD 
staff and in particular, your 
fine sports writer Jon Goetz, for 
your continued support of the 
UCSD Water Polo Team this 
past season. I also speak for all 
the players of this year's team 
wben I say thanks so mucb to 
Judy Sweet, the Intercollegiate 
Athletics Director, for berever 
present JUidance and positive 
ouUook througbout the year. 

Wbat was not brought out in 
Jon's article, thouih, was how 
does Judy Sweet and the 
Athletic Department feel about 
this problem. I feel that is my 
responsibility to comment that 
his problem is known by 
everyone in the Intercollegiate 
Athletic office a~d ~ genuine 
concern for it is shared by all. 

Statement Issued 
The problem Jjes in finances 

(what else!). Faced with 
budget cuts while maintaining 
a teaching staff that in most 
cases does not include coaching 
duties, the P.E . and I.A. 
Department at UCSD finds 
itself with a majority of the 
department's dollars tied up in 
areas other than coaching. 
Trying to accommodate stu-
dent needs and wants in 
athletics over the years, thiS 
dollar has been spread very 
thin indeed, leaving the current 
situation of part-time coaching 
positions. 

U JS Opinion Clarified 
Recently, numerous ques-

tions and concern have been 
raised out of an article that Jon 
wrote that dealt with my 
participation in UCSD Water 
Polo and the feelings I have 
about the inadequacies of the 
part-time coaching program. 

As was brought out in the 
article, I honestly feel the 
student·athlete suffers from 
the transient situation that is 
created by part·time coaches. 
A player that is recruited by a 
coach is not necessarily guar· 
anteed that he or she is going to 
play under that coach for 4 
years. Another major problem 
is that the only time the player 
can approach the coach with a 
problem is between the two 
hours of practice time the 
coach is on campus. 

As an athlete, to adjust after 
a few years, or in some cases, 
year after year to a new coach, 
his style of play , his per-
sonality, his rules that will 
govern the team, is a very hard 
transition to overcome. This 
can cause a turn-over of 
players, a break-up of the team, 
players that lose interest in the 
program and drop out, and 
most importantly, though, 
sometimes creates coaches 
that will not put a complete 
effort (recruiting, fund raising, 
off season training) into a 
program that he or she will not 
be around to be a part of. So as I 

In the past, UCSD has relied 
on abundant teaching positions 
in the San Diego School District 
to place its coaches in a job that 
would allow them to stay on 
here In the afternoon (for 
additional income) . But what 
with the job market as it is, and 
financial pressures increasing, 
it is no longer possible for the 
young coaches to continue year 
after year at UCSD, and they 
are forever looking for per-
manent positions elsewhere. 

So we all share this per· 
plexing problem: the students, 
the athletes, the adminis· 
tration, the Guardian and 
closer to home for me, the 
Water Polo team members, 
past, present and future. 
Suggestions are welcome. 

Sincerely 
Russ Hafferkamp 
Water Polo Coach 

Editor: 
Recently, there has been 

serious confusion about the 
opinion of the Union of Jewish 
Students. Various statements 
by bIdlviduai students have 
been either misquoted, taken 
out of context, or blatantly 
distorted. More importantly, 
these statements by indi viduals 
have been mistakenly linked to 
the UJS. 

The UJS is a collective 
organization. When the UJS 
takes a stand, it will state it 
publicly. We urge other student 
'organizations to follow suit. 

The UJS does not wish to, nor 
need to, resort to petty rhetoric, 
issue-clouding, or name-
calling. If the UJS wishes to 
state an opinion on any issue, it 
will be clear and to the point. In 
summary, the UJS asks for two 
things: (1) not to distort our 
opinions and (2) that state-
ments made by individual 
students, whether or not they 
are Jewish, not be ascribed to 
the UJS. 

We, as the Union of Jewish 
Students wish to make the 
following statement about 
Zionism: 

While Zionism hils Men tkfined 
In varlow ways, we support Zionism 
defined as the national aspirations 
of the Jewish ~opk as fulfilled by 
tilt State of Israel. 

The existence of Israel u a reality.

Ramseyer Alienates 
Editor: 

Bravo! I note that fund raiser 
Ray Ramseyer with his "sug· 
gested guides for generous 
giving" has succeeded not only 
in aJjenating a number of the 
UCSD faculty and alumns 
attending the ten year reunion 
of the Class of 1968, but that now 
he has performed a similar feat 
with some staff in connection 
with the United Way funddrlve. 

Class of 1969, your reunion is 
coming up. Are you ready to 
GIVE generously to the Alumni 
Association? Please do not ask 
- as one brash alumn did last 
June, "What's in itfor me?" As 
Mr. Ramseyer replied, "Ask 
not what your University can do 
for you, but only what you can 
do for your University ." 
Translation: Deep down you 
know you ought to give your fa ir 
share, and to realize your 

stewardship responsibilities. 
. Are you going to be a parasite 
or one of those people who have 
a harder time than others 
parting with money? Excuses, 
excuses, shame, shame! 

Perhaps as In the case of the 
United Way, we can reward 
your contributions with a very 
special "I gave" PIN without 
which you will feel stigmatized. 
Or, maybe to help you re-
member those happy beginning 
days at UCSD, for each one 
hunOred dollars you give us, we 
will give you a little gold star 
just Jjte the ones you used to get 
(if you were good) In your 
language classes. 

And we are told such fund 
raising methods are not aures· 
sive or even counter·produc·

I am writing in response to 
the article on the United Way 
Fund Drive which appeared in 
the November 27th edition of 
The Guardian , in particular the 
remarks of Ray Ramseyer, 
Special Assistant to the Chan-

Ramseyer has been accurately 
Quoted, we are to believe that if 
we do not give to the UW I 
CHAD we are "parasites" who 
do not feel any responsibility 

for our community . I take 
exception to these remarks. I 
cannot speak, obviously, forthe 
motives of every staff em· 
ployee, but among my friends 
are single parents who are the 
sole support of dependent 
children. Others give gener-
ously to their churches or 
alumni associations, lead 
scouting troops, or teach CPR 
for the Red Cross for free. (1

'Ad Nauseam' Students Inspire Attack 

By DorodIy HOIIS&on 
S&aIf WrUer 

I tromped through the euca· 
lyptus near the Health Center 
feeling satisfied. At the Derm 
Clinic I'd been looked at by two 
doctors and two interns, the 
workings of my pores had been 
explained and I'd been given 
some acne destroying medi· 
cine. Maybe now, I thought, I'd 
be on my way to a clear 
complexion! 

But I stopped under the trees. 
I suddenly realized that finally 
after five quarters at UCSD,l'd 
received a service I was happy 
with and one that operated with 
no mix·ups. 

I found myself sad, then 
angry. 

This, then, is an attack on 
UCSD, whic.h can only be an 
attack on its students. 

I'll start by harping on the 
usual: The University is 
overcrowded. Professors don't 
express interest in the under-
graduates, T As can't teach. 
University staff can't spell, and 
drink coffee all the time. There 
is no manifestation of the 
commitment to a liberal arts 
undergraduate education. 
" UCSD education" is listening 
to professors, reading, taking 
the midterm and final. UCSD is 
impersonal. UCSD is unsocial. 

I can continue ad nauleaDI .. . 
And I do continue ad nau-

seam. That's why I'm flunking. 
There Is a high level of anger 
blistering through me that 
won't simmer because it's fed: 
every day I run Into ineptitude 
and rtdJculousity. After classes 
I spit and gnash my teeth, 
yeech, slerillly en masse. It's 
this kind of "education," I 
think, that blocks the reali· 
zation of what true education 
(application, creative thinking, 
witty fun .:... Mmmm) can be 
and mean. 

So I'll continue reading 
feminist novels, writlOi and 
planning my next jaunt (Wash-
ington D.C.!) , and blessing my 
exposure to real education at 
Dartmouth College while on 
exchange. That's a hell of a way 
to gain a college educa tion I tell 
myself, dropping in on college 
in between what really counts. 

Well for me and ramble and 
onto the meat of the piece but 
first (!) I'll posit: the students 
make the school. Therefore this 
is a piece on Student Apathy. 
Oh, snore you say. (ExacUy!) 
I've been told to make this 
lightly humorous to coddle you. 
Forget it. 

I think - why surely! Stu-
dents can emerge from 
crevices and stand on their toes 
and yell to the University YOU 
ARE HERE FOR ME, I 
COUNT, FULFILL YOUR 
COMMITMENT TO THE 
LIBERAL ARTS EDUCA· 
TION! LOOK AT THE RE· 
TENTION RATE! IT'S TER· 
RIBLE! Yes! Yes! Students 
can erupt in class and not let 
their professors get away with 
educational dreck! They can 
get staff off their duffs! They 
can acl on their complaints! 

I get so excited I start this 
series of hops and the blood 
runs to the tips of my ears ... 
but then I crumple remem. 
berlng ... Nope ... No chance ... 
The students are spineless! 
Flaky! Flimsy! Flaccid! 
AdynamiC! 

A professor brings sample 
questions to class before a 
midterm. He reads them very, 
very fast. The cia.. miAe8 
them because they are tryiq to 

write them down. I ask the 
professor to repeat them. He 
does very, very fast again 
without explaining we are to 
USlen not write. Again the 
students miss the questions. 
I'm miffed. But it's after class 
that I get really miffed. The 
students come to me asking if I 
got the questions because I'd 
asked him to repeat them. 
Grrrr. Why couldn't they peep 
up before? 

So I'm a Haughty, Elitist 
Arrogant Primadonna Snot . 
OK. Fine. But that's irrelevant 
to the story. Have I offended 
you so you ' re not reading 
further? I'm thrown down? 
Exaclly. Exactly. 

Continuing: the paper as-
signment for Muir 10 compo-
sition is "Argumentation by 
Analogy." I look at the five 

students I'm tutoring. "What 
do you want to argue?" I ask. 
They stare at me blankly. Oh 
cripes, I mutter. 

The literature professor tells 
us the class is filled and that all 
those not enrolled should leave. 
I need the class to graduate. I 
stand up and demand to know if 
the next day's class is open. I 
rush out sputtering UC is a 
business for keeping me here. I 
forget my shoes. The other 
students not enrolled just 
slither out like beaten dogs .. . 

Pathetic! You make me ill! 
And to think I defended you 
against Dartmouth private 
school preppies (who make 
their school) against the 
Stereotype of the California 
College Student: " They're 
serious students - hardly

I'd sink! Life is tough! It's

Snirne. Sniffle. Life is tough. 
Education is more than mid-
terms and finals ... 

Oh Dorothy be fair! Wasn' t 
it me who immersed myself in 
"UC5D education?" And 
wasn't it me who recently spent 
a half year paddling around a 
river, idling in idle chatter, and 
lying in the grass listening to 
the bugs buzz around my head? 

Yeah, but it wasn't for four 
years , or a lifetime. 

And you' still come back: 
" We' re lucky to be at UCSD. 
It 's the University of Cali-
fornia! I'm not going to get in 
trouble with them! "

PSA At Fault? 
SAN DIEGO (AP) - A 

Federal Aviation Alency 
attorney attempted yesterday 
to demonstrate that the crew of 
a doomed jet-liner faUed to noti-
fy air traffic controllers they 
had lost sigbt of a small plane 
before the aircraft collided in 
the nation's wroat air disaster. 

FAA aaaistant chief counsel 
John R. Harrison questioned 
Pacific Southwest Airlines 
cbief pilot Jack Cowan about 
flight crew procedures duriq 
the fourth day of a federal 
heariDl into the Sept. 5 col-
lision, whicb killed 44 persons in 
San Dielo. ' 

Under questioning by Harri-
son, Cowan told the heariq 
flilbt crew members have the 
responsibility to notify air 
traffic controllers if they lose 
slgbt of or fail to see an aircraft 
they have been advised is In 
their vicinity. 

"If you lose silht of it," 
Cowan said, "you notify the 

facility control center. I would 
say that is of the highest 
priority." 

Earlier testimony and offi-
cial lround-to-air and intra-
cockpit voice recorder tran-
scripts show the jet crew lost 
sight of the small plane in the 
final minutes be!ore the crash. 
The records also show jet crew 
members, while talkiDl among 
themselves about loslq sigbt 
of the single-engine aircraft, 
told air traffic controllers they 
thought they had passed the 
smaller plane. 

Observations and films from 
a test flight indicated the crew 
of PSA flight 11 probably could 
not have seen the smaller plane 
before the collision, Capt. 
Roger D. Crim, president of the 
Southwest FlIgbt Crew Aaaoci-
ation, whicb represent PSA 
crews, ~id Wednesday. He 
said the tests cast doubt on the 
"see-and-avoid" flying pro-
cedures of the FAA.

Encare Oval " was introduced to Ameri-
can doctors in November 1977. Almost 
immediately, it attracted widespread phy-
sician and patient attention. 
Today, Encare Oval is being used by 
hundredS of thousands of women. and 
users surveyed report overwhelming sat-
isfaction. Women using Encare Oval say 
they find it an answer to their problems 
with the pill, IUD's, diaphragms, and aero-

2solfoams. EFFECTIVENESS 
ESTABUSHED IN 
CUNICAL TESTS. 

Encare Oval '" was subjected to one of the 
most rigorous tests ever conducted for a 
vaginal contraceptive. Results were 
excellent-showing that Encare Oval 
provides consistent and extremely high 
sperm-killing protection. This recent U.S. 
report supports earlier studies in Euro-
pean laboratorie~ and clinics. 
Each Encare Oval insert contains a pre-
cise, premeasured dose of the potent, 
sperm-killing agent nonoxynol 9. Once 
properly inserted, Encare Oval melts and 
gently effervesces, dispersing the sperm-
killing agent within the vagina. 
The success of any contraceptive 
method depends on consistent and 
accurate use. Encare Oval '" is so conve-
nient you won't be lempted to forget it. 
And so simple to insert, it's hard to make 
a mistake. 
If pregnancy poses a special risk for you, 
your contraceptive method should be se-

31ected after consultation with your doctor. NO HORMONAL 
SIDE EFFECTS. 

, Encare Oval " is free of hormones, so it 
cannot create hormone-related health 
problems-like strokes and heart 
attacks-that have been linked to the pill. 
And, there is no hormonal disruption of 
your m~nstrual cycle.

expired laat AIJIUIl and was not 
renewed by the insurance 
company, American National. 
Blue Croas took over the 
campus policy for the 71-79 
academic year but their cover-
ale II not extended to athletes. 

"We had leas than a month to 
find a policy that would cover 
our athletes," explained Judy 
Sweet, Intercollqiate Athletic 
Director. Currently UCSD is 
subacribln, to an American 
Home Assurance Policy, a 
secondary policy set up by the 
Student Health Center, at a cost 
of ,14,000 for one year. 

The money to pay for the 
policy came from a special Reg 
Fee reserve fund used in 
emergency situations, such as 
the one faced by the athletic 
department last summer, In 
the event of an athletic injury 
this seco~dary polley takes up 
where the principle policy, 
usually the student's parents' 
insurance policy, leaves off. 

.. Actually the whole policy 
cost more like 'lB,OOO when you 
add the ,100 deductible for each 
athlete," Sweet commented . 
"The athletic department 
wanted to avoid the students 
having to pay this '100 so a 
special pool of ",000, also Reg 
Fee monies, was set up to cover 
this." 

" This year the cost of a 
separate policy for the athletes 
was picked up by these special 
funds," added Dr. Howard 
Hunt, chairman of the Physical 
Education department. " The 
next two years will tell how it 
goes." 

" We've never had to pay 
anything before for insurance 
so $18,000 is a significant 
amount of money," Sweet 
added. " We will have to build 
this cost into the Intercollegiate 
Athletic budget for next year, 
Hopefully the Reg Fee Com-
mittee will see this as a real 
expense that they will cover," 

Kenzie Nicoll, Reg Fee 
chairman, said that the com-
mittee will be faced with a 
" philosophical question" in 
deciding whether or not to use 
Reg Fee monies to pay for the 
athletes' insurance. 

"It becomes a question of 
whether the whole student body 
should pay for the Insurance of 
a limited number of athletes," 

Nicoll emphasized that when 
hearings are held by th'e 
committee in the spring, "a lot 
of student input will be needed 
- especially from those not 
involved in the athletic pro· 
gram," 

The American Home policy is 
based on the number of athletes 
participating in each sport and 
on the risks involved. "With 
this you find that some sports 
are more expensive than 
others," remarked Sweet. 

Rugby , for example, is 
considered a " high risk" sport 
and will cost about '4,000. 
There are 60 participants on the 
team, hQwever, makin, the 
cost approximately $66 per 
player. Soccer, also c1assifjed 
as " hIgh risk" comes down to 
$58 per player. In contrast, 
tennis, cross country , bad· 
minton, and volleyball are all 
only $6 per participant. 

American Home 's poli cy 
covers up to $5,000 for acci· 
dental death or dismember· 
ment, SlO , OOO (or medical 
expenses, and in case of dental 
injury, $250 per tooth.

Thefts Common Over Break the presti~ious Literature Prof. 

By Steve Moraa 
SUIf Writer 

It is common knowledge that 
quarter breaks are bilb rip-off 
times, a problem for students 
and Campus Police both. With 
fall break just a week away, 
Campus Police officer Clark 
Martin has specific suggestions 
on how students can reduce 
their vulnerability. 

Students would be least 
vulnerable, Martin states, "If 
they would just take (their 
posseuions) home with them. " 
If that II not possible, Martin 
then suggests that students 
leave their valuables with a 
friend in the area. The third 
best alternative, Martin said, is 
for residents to contact their 
Resident Dean's office about 
leaving their valuables In an 
area more secure than the 
campus dorms or apartments. 

If atudeaq do decide to leave 
their poesea.1ou in their rooms 
over the break, Martin recom-
mends two simple measures 
that greatly Increase the 
likelihood of stolen property 
being returned to its owner. The 
best thing to do, Martin said, is 
for students to engrave their 
driver's license number into all

Scheduled to be open con-
tinuously from 6 am Monday 
Dec. 4 tills am on Sunday, Dec: 
10, the bum-out center will 
provide free food and drink in a 
restful environment to all 
students. 

According to Eisune Su at 
Page One, the bu~t center 
will be open 24 hours to 
accommodate student study 
breaks and snack attacks 
whenever they occur. Coffee 
and hot chocolate, alonl with 
donuts, popcorn and possibly 
even pizza will be offered Su 
said. ' 

Sources at EDNA who wish to 
remain unidentified claim that 
they too would have sponsored 
a bum-out center again this 
year if the AS Commissioner of 
Programming Melanie AI· 
schuler had provided funding. 
Since Student Center Board 
programming funds , which 
supported EDNA's bum-out 
center last year, no longer 
exists this year, a request was 
made for AS funds citing an 
overwhelmingly positive re-
sponse to a bum-out center 
questionnaire distributed last 

ye~r. The funds were denied. 

"I roally wanted a bum-out 
center," said Programming 
Commissioner Aischuler, but 
at $500 apiece .. ,they are really, 
really expensive." Therefore, 
Alschuler said, she felt it best if 
other programming sources, 
such as Page One, which is 
funded by the Muir Dean, fund 
the centers. 

of their valuables. Secondly, 
Martin suggests that residents 
record the serial numbers on 
every item that carries one. 

Martin said that bicycles are 
the most frequently stolen i tem 
during these high rip · off 
periods, mostly because their 
owners fail to take proper 
precautions. The worst thing to 
do, Martin explained, is to 
leave a bike parked in a rack 
during break, even if it is 
chained. Although the Resident 
Deans usually do not allow 
bicycles in the buildings durina 
instructional periodi, Martin 
said 

exception during vacation 
times and allow bikes to be 
locked in student's rooms. 

Invariably, Martin said, at 
least 10 bikes are lost each 
break simply because students 
do not take these precautions, 

To better protect student 
property during the quarter 
break, Martin said that even 
though the official Campus 
Police Starr will be reduced 
"since our officers want to 
spend Christmas with their ' 
families too," foot patrols by 
sanctioned guards will be 
increased around residence

a most unusual "concert" with 
an audieuce of eiJbt female

Lacy bas bad many IUCb

these occurred durin. bis

'F unking Up' Disco 
Tbank You for Fuldal Up My

By Gay Messenler 
We all know the warniDi 

signs of disco amictlon. First 
comes the pink sJlk Ihirt open to 
the waist, then the tiJht pants 
with no back pocketa .. .Iater, 
victims are stricken by plastic 
blow-dry hairstyles, and, in 
more advanced cases, a con-
spicuous lack of sideburns. The 
disco trend in our country's 
music spreads further every 
day, cruShing creativity and 
exploitinl musicIans in tbe 
interest of pop listeniDl sales. 
Trumpeter Donald Byrd 's

from a Ilance at the SODI Utle.,

one tune was strictly instru-
mental - "Cristo Redentor" is 
the only soDi on the album 
without the words " love" or 
"your love" in the title. Most of 
the cuts are riddled with the 
monotonous thumplnl drum 
beats and dubbed strint orches-
tration so typical of the disco 
musical framework. An added 
irritatiDi feature is a leneral 
playinl down of potenUally 
exciUng work by some very 
talented musicians, especially 
Byrd and guitarist Wah-Wah 
Watson. , 

The lyrics are corny, and to 
make thinls worse, occasional

Upon Iraduatinl in 1973, 
Lacy worked for a Jingle

'Octave' Off 
For Blues 

By Barry Alfonso 
Octave 
The Moody Blues 
(London) 

If God had intended man to 
combine symphony orchestras 
witb rock and roll, Chuck Berry 
WOUld've been born in Vienna. 
I'm not exactly sure what tbat 
means, but I do know this: I've 
never thought that overblown, 
pseudo-classical string and 
horn arrangements added 
anything substantial to a rock 
record. Often such symphonic 
production prompts rock song-
writer to compose annoying 
"spiritual" lyrics to match 
their airy, uplifting music. This 
was and still is the case with the 
Moody Blues, who reformed 
earlier this year to release an 
Ip, Octave. 

This is the group' s first 
collective effort since 1972, but 
time hasn ' t changed the 
Moodies much; the self-con-
sciously dramatic effects that 
typified .. Nilhts in White 
Satin" and their other past hits 
are reworked once again on this 
album. The most notable 
concession to 1971 tastes is the 
use of saxophones to add a 
touch of funkiness. Despite Ihis, 
the Moodies ' songs remain 
mu*ic for the spirit, not the 
body. You don't boolle to this 
band - you ascend. 

were incapable of whetting his 
musical aspiraUons. 

" I get a feeliDi of a higber 
quality of Iif e that I learned 
about in part through playinl 
music," he stated. " I wanted to 
get deeper into that and share 
it. " 

As a response to achieving 
this goal, Lacy set out on his 
own. His efforts have produced 
the formiDi of two Jazz IrouPS. 
The first of these is the Butch 
Lacy String Consort, wbicb 
consists of saxophonist Hollis 
Gentry, pianiat Lacy, vocalist 
Ella Ruth Pillee, and guitarist 
Peter Sprague. Since its ol'lin 
in 1976, this quintet bas per-
formed at Mandeville Center, 
San Dielo State University. 
and University of San Die.o, as 
well as several high schools. 
Recently, the group has played 
at the Catamaran Hotel - an 
engagement which Lacy . con-
siders as " tremendous." In 
addition, the Butch Lacy String 
Consort will air nationally for 
the first time during early 
December via a national public 
ramo show called Jazz Live on 
KBPSFM. 

Lacy's second group can be 
found in the form of a ten-piece 
band. It, like the String Con-
sort, plays only original jazz 
compositions, and has been 
currently appearing at Chuck's 
Steak House from March to 
October of this year. 

Lacy has also demonstrated 
his eagerness to share musical-
ly with the establishment of the 
Arts in Healing Foundation. It 

- I ~ . t 

was started only three months 
alo as a charitable trust. 

" Its purpose is to facilitate 
artists in all media who wish to 
serve the community through 
their art, and also carry on 
research on just how pro-
fessional artists may be used in 
the healing process ," he 
explained. 

With the combined assis-
tance of Mercy Hospital clin-
ical psychololist Susan Trau-
beidge and music therapist 
Charla Parker, Lacy plans to 
conduct this research througb 
what he leeS as " the systematic 
planning and development of 
multi-media programs pre-
sented in any institutions of 
healing." 

One such multi-media pro-
gram is tentatively scheduled 
(or January 23. The location, as 
of yet, has not been determined. 
Its sole sponsor is SIRIUS, a 
coalition of sixty artists whose 
talents range from dance to 
graphic art to lighting to video 
to theater to music. Richard 
Carter and Chet Wooden, along 
with other SIRIUS members, 
are in charge of directing, 
lighting, and grapbics. The 
performers include J . D. 
Steyers and Rivendell Produc-
tions witb a theatrical reading 
of Alice In Wonderland , a 
holistic health rilm entitled 
Bea uty, a twenty-piece or-
chestra, a group of singers, 
mimes, dancers, and lighting 
special eCCects. All proceeds 
from the 8 pm program will go 
to the Arts in Healing Founda-
tion. 

Cliff Richard's Latest 

'Green Light' Goes Pop 
By Ben Bemsteln . 

Cliff Richard's new album, 
Green LI.bt, is like a big jam 
doughnut. If you like the sweet, 
easily accessible sounds of pop 
music, then you will no doubt 
bite into this album with relish 
unbounded. 

Green Lilbl, of course, is not 
serious music, except in the 
fact that Richard is seriously 
trying to make a living out of it. 
It has no statement to make, no 
messale to expound. It exists 
only (or the purpose of livin. 
momentary pleasure , and 
perhaps a melody line or two to 
hum quietly to yourself as you 
walk down a crowded campus 
sidewalk. One listens to this 
album, puts It away, and then 
loes off and does somethiDl 
else, not taldnt any time for 
renection because no wel,hty 

or philosophical concepts are 
introduced. 

For pop, however, this album 
is great. The engineering is 
superb, producing an overall 
sound in a league with Steely 
Dan's album Aja. The playing, 
confined to the standard pop 
repertoire of ,uitars, bass , 
drums and percussion, key-
boards, vocals and strings, il 
clean and profeSSional, with 
nary a buzzing strin. or fudged 
run in evidence. The arran.," 
mt-nt of the songs is also 
enjoya )Ie, with deUlhtCullittle 
musical SUrprileS thrown In 
just \0 keep you on )'wr ear's 
tuell. 

Richard 's voice Is perfectly 
suited to the meno . songs he 
siDls, cominl throuth with 
clarity and warmth. MUSically, 
it is the most impressive thil!C (l»Ieue ,.n 10 pate .t)

Richard 
(Colldnued from pale') 
OD the album. Ria 20 years of 
experience in the mule in-
dustry baa taugbt him well 
what to do with his vocals. 

Lyrically, the album suffers 
from a lack of diversity. Not 
only do the words show a lack of 
Inspiration, but they deal 
almost exclusively with that 
most standard of popular 
themes, love lost and mourned. 
The clever arrangements and 
accomplished sinlinl, how-
ever, keep the mundane words 
from infringing too heavily into 
the listener's consciousness. 

One of the songs, "Under 
Lock and Key," might cost 
Richard a few of his more 
feminist-minded listeners. Just 
look at this chauv i nistic 
sampling: "I said alright babe 
you !;Ieat be runnin' now I You're 
through with cheatinl on mel 
I'm lonna keep you under lock 
and key." Though the song has 
a thoroughly enjoyable com-
bination of music and delivery, 
the male supremacy attitude is 
out of place in this day and age. 

ThoUlh it has Iightweilht 
lyrics (a common feature of 
popular music), they are more 
than made up for by the 
album's excellent vocals, 
musicianship and arrange-
ment. So if you like bil jam

music, it would be worth your 
while to check out Green

dance sequences are enough to 
inspire the audience to take Its 
own trip down the Yellow Brick 
Road. and Diana Ross's 
stirring "Home" is a close rival 
to Judy Garland's poignant 
"Over The Rainbow." How-
ever. these brief moments of 
glory hardly compensate for 
the movie's drawbacks. 

The "Iz should heed its own 
words by "easing on down the 
road" back to its proper place 
on the stage. It simply doesn't 
belong on the screen.

"Surf's up! " cried Debbie 

Harry, lead singer of Blondie. 
as she ran on stage at the Roxy 
Theater to sing "In the Sun." 
For those of you wbo don't know 
- Blondie is one of the best up 
and coming pop bands around. 
Backed by five distinctive 
musicians, Harry fronts this 
60s style pop band. serving as 
tbe focal point for the group. 

Blondie's first show was tight 
and well-paced. but Debbie 
Harry seemed very detached 
from the audience and almost 
bored. The most enthusiasm 
came from bobbing Nigel 
Harrison. the bassist. Their 
repertoire was a wide range of 
their old and new songs. as well 
as a few covers. One of the most 
memorable numbers was 
"Pretty Baby," a love song

Introducing a New Line of Racing Silks: 

dedicated to actress Brooke 
Shields. It seemed to end ana 
then start up again in a way 
which sounded most like a 
record whose plug has just been 
pulled for a second. then 
reinserted so tbat tbe disk 
speeds up again. Blondie also 
did "Heart of Glau." a disco-
pop song which displays their 
versatility. with Debbie doing 
disco steps in the background 
including a John Travolta 
Saturday NI,b& Fever pose! 
The highlight of tbe show was 
their encore, when Harry 
exclaimed: "If tbis was a dance 
contest. I won! II and the 
audience rushed up to the stage 
to hear Blondie do T. Rex's 
classic. "Get It On. Bang A 
Gong." 

The second show's audience 
took a tip from the first and 
rushed the stage early in the 
set. Half of the audience was 
crammed into the space be-
tween the first row and the 
stage. but most agreed it was 
well worth the discomfort. The 
band reacted to the audience's 
enthusiasm, and played a more 
energetic set. catering to tbe 
Blondie cultists in the audience. 
In addition to their regular set. 
Blondie did an old Iggy song. 
"Sister Midnight." with a slow 
sensual beat provided by 
drummer Clement Burke . 
Blondie obliged the frenzied 
audience with two encores . 
including a version of David 
Bowie's "Heroes." ("I will be 
Queen, and you will be 
King ... " ) 

All in all, this added up to the 
best Southern California Blon-
die performance in over a year. 
Because of their rising popu-
larity. Blondie has·had to play 
larger concert halls. where 
their impact is lost. Playing 
this small theater with maxi-
mum audience contact was 
ideal for Blondie. My con-
clusion: Blondie is not a band to 
be listened to sittin, down.

Alhlete, of Ibe Month 

SWimmer, Surfer Lauded For Efforts 
By Karen Hunler 

Sporg Edilor 
Claudia O'Brien of the 

women's swim team and Rich 
Gleaves of the surfing team 
have been named November's 
Athletes of the Month by the 
Intercollellate Athletic De-
partment. 

The award, based on leader-
ship and athletic ability, is 
awarded monthly to the male 
and female athletes that ~t 

meet this criteria. A committee 
composed of the intercollegiate 
athletic director. sports in-
formation director, and 
Guardian sports editor makes 
the final decision based on 
coaches' recommendations. 

Other athletes wbo received 
bonorable mentions for No-
vember are Cheryl Wright 
(volleyball). Sheila O'Brien 
(field hockey), Kai Loedel 

(water polo) , and Peter Matz 
(soccer). 

Female Athlete 
Not ollly has Claudia O'Brien 

broken three individual school 
records in women's swimming 
after only two meets this year, 
she also is involved in junior 
national water polo compe-
tition. 

O'Brien currently holds 
UCSD records in tbe 200 and 100 

year freestyle events and 50 
yard breaststroke. Sbe also 
anchored the record setting 200 
yard freestyle relay team. 

"Claudia takes initiative, she 
doesn' t wait to be told what to 
do." commented women's 
swim coach, Diana Daon. " She 
sets a good example for other 
team members by her hard 
work and discipline." 

A freshman , O' Brien is 
described as being " really 
pleasant to be around. She is 
always willing to help out the 
other girls on the team." Dann 
commended. " Claudia has 
great rapport with her peers 
and teammates . She hasn't 
missed one workout yet. " 

Presently O'Brien has double 
workouts - practiCing with the 
men ' s team in the early 
morning and the women's team 
in the evening. Her water polo 
team won the regional playouts 
over Thanksgiving. O' Brien

team wins there. it's on to the 
nationals. 

O'Brien and her teammates 
take on Pomona Pitzer in an 
important swim meet on 
Saturday afternoon at 1 pm in 
the UCSD pool. 

Surfer Wins Award 
Warren College senior, Rich 

Gleaves. an intercollegiate 
surfer, has been the team 's 
kneeboarder for the past four 
years. In the four years he has 
been in competition Gleaves 
says he has only been defeated 
once. 

INTRAMU-RAL TEAM 
OF THE WEEK 

"I've been the main knee-
rider on the team since my 
freshman year. " Gleaves 
remarked. .. Kneeboarders 
really aren't all that common. 
In some competitions there are 
no other koeeboarders so I've 
tried stand up, too." Gleaves 
added. "I'm not all that bad 
either." he grintled. "I got third 
in my heat last weekend." 

Bolton Colburn, Gleaves ' 
coach, commented..that " team 
members look to Rich for 
authority and respect bis 
judgment. He has a wider base 
of information due to his long 
years involved in the sport." 

Equipment for Rich's sport 
consists of a very wide knee-
board (24") of his .own design . 

Hearings 
(Continued from page 11) 

However , cutting whole 
programs, a possibility fre-
quently mentioned in UCSD 
appraisals of budget cut effects 
is difficult Doolittle said 

because "there just ain 't no fat 
left; everything you cutis going 
to hurt academic programs. 

" It's like Charlie Chaplin 
eating a shoe. Do you start with 
the heel or the toe. or just nibble 
at the shoelaces?" 

Fraser told the SUbcom-
mittee that' 'I wouJdn't want to 
be challanged to name the 
number of people we've lost in 
the last ten years because of 
salaries, " adding that faculty 
salaries are often as much as 25

Beavers Baffled By-Triton Tactics 
By Jon Goelz 

Selliar S&.ff Wrker 
The basketball playersl 

scientiats of Cal Tech failed to 
come up with the winning 
formula Tuesday, and the 
UCSD forces atomized them, 
99-42. 

CIT blunders and routine 
UCSD execution led to a 57-16 

halftime lead for the Tritons. 
The me~lJeu slaUJljter of the 
hapless Beavers turned the 
partisan San Dle,o crowd 
agall\st their own school, 
especially When UCSD would 
not allow a Cal Tech score for 
nearly 10 minutes of the 40 
minute game.

had hla squad playing a game of 
musical chairs with his ram-
pant substitution. Not only did 
all 12 men on the roster get 
substantial playing time, but 
they all contributed at least 
three points to the final tally. 

"It gave me a good, hard look 
at my bench," said the Triton 
coach. "Now I'm thinking 01 
bringing up some JV guards." 

"It's bard to play against a 
team like Cal Tech," said 
Cunrungham. "Still, the offense 
lacked execution. We need 
work on the fundamentals ." 

Individual Scorlnl{ 
In individual offensive play, 

Lee Brockett led scoring with 18 
first half points. Two other 
players scored in double 
figures, Tom Omalev with 16, 
and Howard GrunJoh with 14. 

At best, the lopsided game 
was a warmup for the Tritons, 
who travel north this weekend 
for the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
Tournament. The other teams 
in the tournament, Stanislaus 
State and Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, will provide keen com-
petition for UCSD, but Poly is 
considered one of the best 
Division II teams in the west. 

The Tritons will certainly 
need a better shooting per-
centage than Tuesday's 58% to 
outscore Cal Poly.

JV Resale. 
Earlier in the eveninJ, the JV 

team outgunned a scrappy 
Camp Pendleton Marine Corps 
Recruit Depot team 116 ... 

The better condltioned Tri-
tons scored effectively on both 
fast breaks and set offense 
shots . They contained' the 
Marines with a full court press, 
but often got burned in the lirst 
hall on last breau. 

The visitors tired in the final 
period, however, and lost the 
effectiveness of their only 
scoring weapons , full court 

passes and the long breaks. 
They only got off 21 points in 
that half. 

UCSD, on the other hand, had 
balanced scoring the entire 
,ame. All 12 players scored, 
seven of them, Steve Turner, 
Dana Bedard, Dave Sonte, 
Paul Gardner, Aaron Lampltin, . 
Steve Holland. and Guy Salz-
man, put in at least 10. 

Coach King Wayman In-
dicates that he wants his team 
to set a fast tempo in future 
games, as they did Tuesday.

four , with the exception of 
Gleaves, will team up with 
Geoff Biehl, Mike Trotta, and 
Billy Stern to represent UCSD

Housing 
(Continued from page 5) 

Although he admits that the 
summer housing situation this 
year "is not 100"/0 satisfac-
tory ," Barrett feels that 
"something is better than 
nothing." 

Summer housin, at Revelle 
will be restricted to those 
students who have lived In 
University housing the entire 
academic year. Those who opt 
for the Revelle housing must 
remain all three months , 
Barrett said. 

Barrett explained that stu-
dents choose to live on cam-
pus durin, the summer for 
various reasons. "Some are 
here for the summer (aca-
demic) session, some to work 
on or off campus, and others 
who just want to stay," he said. 

I( the Revelle residence halls 
cannot accommodate all those 
who seek campus housing this 
summer, Barrett said that he 
" would encourage them to go to 
off·campus housing."

L'Chaylm Allocation Controversial 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

A_I c'ate News EcII_ 
A stron,ly disputed allo-

cation to L'Cllaytm, which AS 
Prelident John Jenkel said 
yelterday be'll veto , and 
another 8II8J'Y confrontation 
between Barry Hyman and Ann 
Carberry dominated the AS ' 
Council meetiq Wednesday 
nilbt· 

The L'CIIayim diapute in-
volved a vote of funding of $100 
for a trip to New York for J arnie 
Adler, the journal's editor, and 
an al yet unnamed staff 
member. Proponents of the bill, 
inclucliq the bill's sponsor, 
Elections Commissioner and 
L·C....,.. AuiBtant Editor Phil 
Ganaler, ar,ued that the 
fundin, would help keep 
L'C""'" in a pre-eminent 

position as an "outstanding" 
Jewish student newspaper. 

Jenkelsald, however, that he 
saw no reason to ,ive "special 
consideration" to L'Cbayim, 
adelln,: "We're having enough 
troubles Just keeplnl other 
campus journals publishing." 

The vote on the funding was 
taken three times. After the 
first vote , Ann Carberry , 
Council Chair, ruled that 
abstentions would be counted 
against the two-thirds vote 
needed to pass the allocation. 

After several Council mem-
bers cballen,ed that ruling, it 
was reversed, and two more 
votes, with the allocation 
supported each time, finally 
approved the measure. 

As bas been the case through-
out the quarter, an an,ry 

confrontation between Car-
berry and Student Welfare 
Commissioner Barry Hyman 
marked Wednesday 'oi,ht's 
meeting. The two, who have 
been feuclin, in the Council all 
quarter, clashed this time over 
recognition of speakers on an 
allocation to Focus, the phone 
crisis agency on campus, 

Carberry recognized Carlos 
Montalvo, Public Relations 
Commissioner ahead of · Hy-
man, and Hyman reacted by 
breaking into a string of 
shouted obscenity, directed at 
botb Carberry and Montalvo. 
The outburst was gaveled to a 
halt by Carberry after Mon-
talvo joined In, and he and 
Hyman argued. 

The Focus allocation was not 
approved. 

In other action Wednesday 
night, the Council: 

- approved the $300 , 000 
Student Center Board Budlet, 
after hearin, Barry Hyman 
a,ree with John Jenkel that 
"This is where the democratic 
process breaks down ... We 
don't know what we're talking 
about when we try and criticize 
tbis budget. " 

- approved supplemental 
funds for KSOT and L'Cbayim, 
allowing both to continue or 
expand operations. 

- approved a policy state-
ment of support for campus 
interdisciplinary programs 
prepa ratory to Assembly 
hearings on the matter yes-
terday and today. 

- appointed Jane Toggen-
burger to the Student Center 
Board.

Food Fight Fund Drive Terminates 
(Continued from pale 1) 
with the food fight incldent by 
the end of the quarter, Jeff 
Silverman, student head of the 
RCCA, said that the RCCA 
faces "00 real time limit" and 
will discuu their next step until 
spring quarter If they need to. 
RCCA's concern, Silverman 
sa1d, iI that the COlt of the food 
fight not be paued on to future 
students. Nevertheless RCCA 
is considering putting up 
matcbing funds with the Han 
Program Advison, possibly as 
much as $200 apiece Silverman 
indicated. 

The handling of the "Revelle 
Five," as the identified food 
fighters came to be known 
before Stonn's death, " was 
never intended to be a big 
dUlcipllnary action," Mort said. 
The name the " Revelle Five,"

writer, not tbe people that dealt 
with tbe students, Judith

Food Services Larry Barrett,

Fraser told the commit-
tee, "I was shocked to hear (UC 
President David) Saxon tell the 
Regents, 'If you're going to 
meet a 10 percent cut, you'd 
have to close 75 departments. '" 

Doolittle said that if depart-
ments bad to be cut , the basic 
programs, such as pre-med 
offerings here, would remain at 
more or less their present state
