UC Releases Admissions Data 
DIVERSITY: More underrepresented minority students applied this year 
By VINCENT QRAGNANI 
News Editor 

The University of California 
received a record 85,818 appli-
cations for fall quarter enroll-
ment with an increase in appli-
cations from almost all ethnic 
groups. 

UCSD received the second 
highest amount of applications, 

su~ only by UCLA. 
It's a record number of 

applications for us," said 
RiChard Backer, assistant vice 
chancellor of enrollment man-
agement, and registrar. "Most 
noteworthy are the increases in 
numbers of African American, 
Chicano and Latino [appli-
cants]. It's very dramatic and 

we are very pleased with the 
numbers." 

Backer said that while he 
hopes the university will enroll 
an increased number of under-
represented minorities, it is too 
early to know which applicants 
will be admitted to UCSD, and 
of those admitted, who will 
ultimately accept offers of 
admission. 

"We are cautiously opti-
mistic," Backer said. "We won't 
have admission numbers until 
the end of March and we won't 
have enrollment numbers until 
May." 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar 
said that enrollment numbers 
will be more significant than 
application numbers. 

"We're just halfway there," 
he said. "We need to get [under-
represented minorities) to come 
to our school." 

UCSD received a record 
41,386 applications. Of those, 
Backer said that about 3,300 
will attend UCSD as freshmen 
in the fall, an increase of 100 
students from the number of 
students admitted last year. He 
also said that he expects UCSD 
to enroll 1,100 transEer students, 
up 150 from last year. 

The current surge in 
California's college-age popula-
tion is expected to boost enroll-
ment at the University of 
California by 40 percent

Angelou to 
Speak at 
Graduation 
CEREMONY: All-
campus commencement 
will cost $130,000 
B MAn SCHRADER 
Staff Writer 

After almost two months of 
debate and uncertainty, Maya 
Angelou accepted UCSO's offer 
to speak at this year's aU-campus 
commencement, to be held on 
June 12. 

'' In a world with only a few 
household names, Maya Angelou 
has become one," Vice Chancellor 
Jim Langley said. "She is one of 
the most important voices in not 
only world literature, but also in 
modem thinking." 

A.S. President Tesh KhulJar, 
who headed the search for a grad-
uation speaker along with A.S . 
Programmer Scott ManteU, said 
he is pleased with Angelou's 
commitment and said he expects 
students to respond positively to 
her speech. 

"I am beyond happy right 
now," Khullar said. "In my opin-
ion this is one of the most impor-
tant things that the A.S, [Council) 
has done aU year." 

Langley originally set a dead-
line for last Monday at noon for 
the A.s. Council to find a speaker. 
That deadline was extended 
because Angelou's agent did not 
yet have an answer; Angelou con-
firmed early last week. 

Khullar said that everyone he 
has talked to is delighted about 
Angelou's involvement. 

"Now that it has been made 
official, I have heard nothing but 
positive comments from people," 
he said. "Everyone is excited 
because of the name of the speak-
er.1I

tration has budgeted $130,000 for

lAME SHOW: Winning team will go on to compete against other universities in regional tournament 
., SCOTT DOIROIKI 

The All-Carnpus Tournament 
for Col.leRe Bowl 2000 will be held 
Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the Price 
Center Theatre to determine 
which group of students will ~ 
resent UCSD in the regional 
ColleRe Bowl championships. 

COllege Bowl - the game 
show-style event that pits the 
best mfuds on campus against 
one another to answer all types 
of questioN - OCCUR annually 
and features students rep~ta-

lives from each college. 
"They ask all sorts of ques-

tions," said Sean Powell, whose 
team will represent Muir coll~ at 
Wednesday's tournament !hey 
tend to ask us things from popular 
culture to nuclear physi~, to 
Tchaikovsky to Baywatch. There's 
a lot of diverse questions." 

The prelimiriary college bowl 
tournament occurs every winter 
quarter in each of the five UCSD 
colleges. Prom there, the winning 
group advances to the all<ampus 
tournament where each college's 
team winners will compete head-

to-head to determine which team 
will advance to the regional 
championships and represent 
UCSO against other universities. 

Powell, a junior philosophy 
major who has participated in 
College Bowl since his freshman 
year, said the competition has the 
tendency to generate entertain-
ment as well as rivalry among 
participants. 

"There is a great deal of rival-
ry in College Bowl," Powell said. 
"We expect [the competitors) to 
respect us, but not like us." 

Powell also said that College 

Bowl 2000 is a fun experience as 
long as every competitor keeps in 
mind that it is still only a game. 

College Bowl 2000 has gained 
popularity. over the years with 
increasing numbers of UCSD stu-
dent participants as well as an 
increase in the number of fans 
attending College Bowl tourna-
ments to cheer their favorite team. 

College Bowl 2000 is spon-
sored by the University Centers, 
the Pulse and the five colleges.

in getting into classes. Backer said 
he is confident that the campus 
will respond quickly to the needs 
of the expanding student popula-

Congo, add 5,537 troops. This 
would include infantry as well as 
medical, communications, mine-
clearance and air- and water-
transportation experts for a near-
ly roadless region. The startup 
cost is estimated at $41 million. 

In his report, Annan said that 
960,000 Congolese had been dis-
placed by the war and that they 
and another 300,000 refugees 
from other wars in the region 
were dangerously short of food. 

Diplomats and U.N. officials 
say they see in Congo's complicat-
ed war a challenge like no other 
that the organization has faced 
since the Balkans disintegrated 

PRIMARY: 
Competition reflects 
influx of new voters 
ContInued"fronI ..... 1 
were "quite a significant number 
of independents on the fence 
between McCain and Bradley." 

Only two days before the pri-
mary in New Hampshire on 
Tuesday, Bradley and McCain 
were locked in an imrrobable 
struggle over a tiny poo of truly 
independent voters who are 
allowed to cast ballots in the 
Democratic or Republican contest 
and, it turns out, are torn 
between the two men. 

It seems particularly un\ilcely 
because they are hardly political 

into ethnic warfare after the col-
lapse of European communism. 

Richard Holbrooke, the 
American representative, called 
the unusual meeting of African 
presidents and ministers as 
January's council president. He 
has been telling U.N. officials and 
members of Congress that the 
Congo operation may be the 
United Nations' last chance to 
prove it can get peacekeeping 
right. That was the message he 
delivered directly to the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee on 
its recent field trip to New York. 

Other diplomats say that this 
assertion masks another problem. 
Unless the United States allows 
the Security Council and the U.N. 
peacekeeping department to 
mount a credible . operation in 
Congo, they say, the organization 
will be in danger of repeating its 
experiences in Somalia and 

lookaIikes: Bradley does not ,,{ince 
when he is called a liberal. McCain 
happily calls hirnseIf a conserva-
tive. In the closing stretch of the 
campaign, both candidates have 
intensified their pitches to inde-
pendent-minded voters by 
emphasizing their proposals to 
reform the campaign finance sys-
tem - and by portraying them-
selves as Washington iconoclasts. 

Such competition between 
candidates in different parties is 
highly unusual and reflects, in 
part, an influx of new voters into 
this state who are less rooted with 
one party or another. 
- It makes for an unlikely scene 

on the campaign trail. An old pick-
up truck parked near a Bradley 
event in Concord on Sunday had 
two bumper stickers: One for 

Rwanda, two regional conflicts 
that it proved unable to bring 
under control. 

In the case of Rwanda, where 
a genocidal war in 1994 first dis-
rupted the region and drew 
Congo into the fighting, the 
United States prevented the 
Security Council from acting for 
several months. 

Holbrooke says he is deter-
mined that that will not happen 
again. At the same lime, 
Holbrooke has been urging 
African leaders, on a trip there in 
December and in the Security 
Council this month, to take more 
responsibility for the region. 
Without political will in Africa, 
he tells them, nothing the United 
Nations tries can possibly work. 
A few Africans left New York last 
week saying they felt "bullied." 

- Barbara Crossette 
The Nw York Times 

Bradley and one for McCain. It 
was only fitting that in between 
the stickers was a "Live Free or 
Die" license plate, reflecting the 
state slogan that celebrates New 
Hampshire's maverick image. 

Roughly 37 percent of regis-
tered voters in New Hampshire 
are not affiliated with one party 
or another. The majority of those 
voters lean toward one party or 
another. 

So, says · Andrew E. Smith, 
director of surveys for the 
University of ew Hampshire, 
McCain and Bradley are battling 
over three percent to five percent of 
the voters who truly are open to 
jumping from one party to flnother.

A new baseball stadium will help bolster San Diego's reputation as 'America's Finest City' 

and give the voters the cultural landmark they have demanded . 
By KIM HOOPER 
Staff Writer 

Ever since I can remember, base-
ball has been a part of my life. My 
dad pLayed for the Minnesota 
Twins until a shoulder injury 
ended his pitching career forever. 
Luckily, his passion for the game 
was passed down to me, although 
I'm not sure if it had to do with 
genetics or the fact that he bought 
me my first baseball mitt before I 
had lost my first tooth. 

Whatever the reason, I inherited 
a distinct appreciation for the puri-
ty of the game. My first crush was 
on Vin Scully, the infamous 
Dodgers announcer, but it soon 
ended when I learned that he was 
old enough to be my grandfather. 
(Give me a break, I was just a kid!) 

My dad and 1 have this dream of 
visiting the ballpark of every Major 
League Baseball team. We've 
crossed several off the List, includ-
ing those of the Oakland Athletics, 
L.A. Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, 
Chicago White Sox, New York 
Yankees, Florida Marlins, Colorado 
Rockies and - most recently - the 
San Diego Padres. 

Driving. up to Qualcomm 
Stadium for the first time, I did not 
get the feeling 1 had when I saw 
Fenway Park or Yankee Stadium. 
Qualcomm does not seem like the 
embodiment of the Padres, or any 
Major League Baseball team for 
that matter. In fact, it feels like a 
rented space, a temporary arrange-
ment for whatever athletic team 
happens to occupy it. 

To the casual observer, 
Qualcomm's impersonality would-
n't be a big deal. To them, a game is 
a game, a ballpark is a ballpark. · 
However, during my visit to the 
stadium, the Pacfres had one of the 
top teams in baseball, and I guess I 
expected that, like most major 
league teams, they would have 
their own stadium instead of hav-

ing to share a corporate-sponsored 
space with the Chargers. 

Instead, the reality is ,hat the 
Padres have not had a true baseball 
park, like Lane Field, which they 
left in 1957, or Westgate Park, 
which they left in 1967, since they 
moved to San Diego Stadium 
(renamed Jack Murphy Stadium 
then Qualcomm Stadium). As the 
Padres gain respect in the baseball 
world, it is time for that to change. 

San Diego voters feel as strongly 
as I do about the need to embrace 
the city's baseball team - in 
November of 1998 voters approved 

rary financial strain on the d~ 
Groundbreaking is set to . n 

in April, and the duration of e 
project will likely be close to two 
years. According to plans, the fin-
ished ballpark wi!] include roughly 
46,000 seats, 60 suites and seven 
restaurants. 

The new ballpark will allow for 
some of the best viewing in Major 
League baseball. Instead of having 
sections of "good" and "bad" seats 
(like Qualcomm), all seats in the sta-
dium will be angled toward the 
pitcher's mound so that all visitors 
will be treated to a quality View. 

Driving up to {}palcomm Stadium for the first time, I did 
not get the feeling I had when I saw Fenway Pari or 
Yankee Stadium. {}palcomm does not seem liie the 
embodiment of the Padres, or any Major League BasebaU

the downtown redevelopment pro-
ject, which includes plans to con-
struct a new ballpark. 

Aside from providing the 
Padres with a place to call home -
which they have certainly eamed 
considering aU of the San Diego 
fans (and money) they have drawn 
to baseball - the project will also 
renovate the stagnant, deteriorat-
ing downtown area. The park will 
be just one part of what will be 
called the Ballpark District featur-
ing hotels, retail businesses and 
residential units. 

Yes, the project will cost close to 
$411 million, but it is important to 
consider that the Padres and other 
private enterpri!1e5 are dedicated to 
funding more than a quarter of the 
tab. Recently, the Padres offered to 
provide another $47.8 million for 
the project. More importantly, the 
investment will have long-term 
benefits that outweigh any tempo-

The redevelopment project will 
also spur economic growth in 
downtown San Dieao. The park 
itself will need I\undreds of 
employees, from those who throw 
peanuts with reckless abandon to 
the security guards who haul away 
fans who consume too many beers. 
Outside .of the park, the hotels and 
retail establishments will draw 
business to a somewhat degenerat-
ing area of San Diego, creating 
more jobs and revenues, Tourists 
wanting to catch a glimpse of Tony 
Gwynn can buy tickets to the game, 
munch on popcom, sip soda, stop 
at the memorabilia stand for a 
Padres hat or socks that elay "Take 
Me Out to the Ball Game and even 
grab diJtn« at a local eatery. 

there have been many argu-
ments against the redevelopment 
project concerning the pouible 
destruction of downtown IUstorical 
sites and the possible poUutlon of 

the environment. However, a set-
tlement was reached between the 
National Trust for Historic 
Preservation, the Save Our 
Heritage Organization, San Diego 
Mayor Susan Golding and the San 
Diego Padres that' guarantees that 
the historic resources within the 
ballpark area will be preserved. 

The Padres and the City of San 
Diego have reached an agreement 
witn the Environmental Health 
Coalition to make sure air quality, 
urban run-off and removal of haz-
ardous materials related to the 
redevelopment project is in accor-
dance with city environmental 
guidelines. 

It is wrong to assume that the 
ballpark is draining the city of its 
resources and that the Padres lack 
concern for the general health of 
the city. There are several indepen-
dent organizations looking over 
the shoulder of those in charge of 
the project, making sure that all 
developments coincide with the 
best interests of the community. 

Initiatives seeking to limit or can-
cel construction are plaguing the 
process, threatening to enii the pro-
ject. Ironically, theSe initiatives are 
the real waste of time, money and 
energy. California law states ttiat the 
only pu~ of.an initiative is to 
propoee lqislative acts, not to chal; 
Ienge administrative acts mandated 
by previous1)"appl'Oved legislation. 
The people of sari Diego spoke their 
minds two years ago when they 
gave the project a go. The last-
minute attempts of opponents to 
stan the project are not only invalid, 
but al80 desrerate. 

For San LJiego to justify its nick-
name of" America's Finest City," it 
needs development projects. The 
new ballparK Is a Itep toward 
growth and a step towlid Inaeu-
ing respect for the Padres. 
Hopefully, by 2002, my dad and I 
will have a new stadium to visit.

The Failure of National Health Care Seventeen-Year-Old 
Helps Scarred Women COMMENTARY: Private enterprise provides better service than Medicare 

By MELANIE HOHLFELD 
Staff Writer 

Concern for 1he well-being 
of health care in the United 
States has increased in the past 
few years as the baby boomer 
segment of the American popu-
lation nears the age of retire-
ment. This may seem like a 
problem far removed from stu-
dents, but these issues will 
become more and more impor-
tant as we prerare to deal with 
the reali ties 0 heal th care and 
taxes. 

Medicare is divided into two 
parts. It consists of a trust fund 
and a voluntary program that 
covers doctors' bills. The trust 
fund, which provides for the 
hospital bills of senior citizens 
and disabled individuals, is in 
danger of going bankrupt as 
the largest demographic of the 
U.S. population - the "baby 
boomers" - reaches old age 
because the amount of money 
being' taJ(en out of the system 
will far exceed payments made 
Irom income tax. This issue 
should be -important to UCSD 
students because they are pay-
ing taxes into this dying sys-
tem. More importantly, should 
tax payers put their money into 
a program that does not effi-
ciently address the needs of 
society? 

This month President 
CHnton proposed a national-
ized hearth care plan whereby 
all American citizens and legal 
residents are guaranteed a 
nationally defined, comprehen-
sive package of benefits as well 
as enrollment in a health plan. 
Doubt remains, however, as to 

whether this plan is realistic 
and whether the government 
will respond to Its proposal. 

Clinton has argued that 
health care is something that 
should be provided to all seg-
ments of society - that it is in 
the interest of every American 
to ensure the well-being of fel-
low Americans. I do not dis-
agree that health care should be 
extended to the largest number 
of people that it is able to reach. 
However, proponents of 
nationalized health care claim 

The point is) nationalized 
heatih care doesn)t work. 
It interfms with normal 
market fortes and in the 
end hurts those whom it 
WIlS designed to help. Tax 
p"yers) including (fCSD 
rtudents) wiD. not 'benefit 
from paying into a dying 
system. 

·that without the government's 
help, poorer sections of the 
population will be unable to 
afford health care. In reality, the 
U.S. government's involvement 
in health care is currently creat-
ing .more problems than it is 
solVing . 

There are three fundamental 
problems with our nation's 
h~alth care program: Medicare 
and Medicaid are not helping 
those who most need assis-
tance, wasteful spending is 
encouraged as people are 
spending the government's 

,{liii6i,I§6'lmi'''i~] 

money instead of their own and 
government programs limit 
consumer choice. 

The government foots more 
than half of all hearth care bills. 
Americans only pay 21 cents 
from their own pockets for every 
dollar of service they receive. 
This figure can be misleading; 
we assume that as the second 
largest national social assistance 
program, this money would be 
going to citizens who are unable 
to afford individual health insur-
ance, such as the young, old or 
poor. 

Wrong. In reality, this money 
typically goes to people who are 
employed, because the govem-
ment subsidizes employer fringe 
benefits - which is why many 
critics say that public health care 
subsidizes the rich. 

As the poorer segments of 
the population, the unem-
ployed, elderly and employees 
of small businesses do not bene-
fit from the system that was cre-
ated to help them. To add insult 
to injury, small businesses still 
pay taxes to support these pro-
grams - money that they could 
use to purchase private health 
insurance for their own employ-
ees. 

Government spending is high 
because programs like Medicare 
lead to waste by interfering with 
market forces. Consumers are 
more likely to purchase services 
they do not need when some 
else is paying. A study by the 
Rand Corporation in 1999 
showed that health care spend-
ing could decrease by 30 percent 
with no adverse effects on health

Government cannot

by cutting wasteful spending 
and making sure resources are 
only applied when care is neces-

The point is, nationalized 
health care doesn't work. By 
interfering with normal market 
forces, it hurts those who it was 
designed to help. Tax payers, 
including UCSD students, will 
not benefit from paying into a 
dying system. While Clinton's 
nationalized health care plan is 
a noble idea, its fallacy is that it 
provides for greater govern-
ment involvement. 

There are viable alternatives 
to this health care mess. 
Consumers can secure private 
health insurance by purchasing 
plans with higher deduetibles 
and lower premiums. A family

Loss of Offices Prompted by Negligence 
Editor: 

1 was disappointed when I read 
Matt Schrader's article on the Vaz 
FrrmterizA's loss of their office space 
("UCAB, Vaz Reach Compromise," 
Jan. 24) .• Whenever a newspaper 
writes on a debate, it should always 
try to interview people on both 
sides of the issue; in this case, 
Schrader interviewed people from 
the Voz, but not in the Association 
for Computing Machinery - the 
organization IIlat is occupying the 
office that the Vaz lost. 

We are quite upset that t.he 
administration would give the Vaz 
its office back simply because the 
Vaz was able to get 50 people to 
protest its eviction. Frankly speak-
ing. the Vaz is a lot better at playing 
the discrimination card than it is at 
publishing a newspaper. In the last 
three years I haven't seen a single 
new issue of the Vaz come out. All 
that it has done is protest every 
time something is taken away from 
them. This year it's members are 
marching because they've lost their 
office space, last year it was 
because the A.S. Council cut its 
funding when the Voz again forgot 
to fill out its renewal form. 

I think the real travesty here 
isn't that the Vaz wiJI have to share 
an office with another organiza-
tion, but that it was given it back 
just because it organized a demon-
stration. The Vaz should be held to 
the same rules as all the other stu-
dent organizations. It's not dis-
crimination that got it kicked out 
- it's fairness.

2000 event? The rave culture right 
now is the single biggest cultural 
movement in Southern 
California. The fact that UCSD let 
the DVe have a rave on campus 
is highly commendable to the 
university for recognizing that 
movement. 

The fact that you passed off its 
importance to any number of 
fields, from music to art to poli-
tics, by simply giving it a picture 
on the front page is sad. 
Hopefully, the peopfe, especially 
students, who attended the rave 
on Saturday have some vision of 
its significance. However, this is

Fears of AOL-owned 
Monopoly Unjustified 
Editor: 

It has come to my attention 
that the author of "Watch Out for 
AOL" Gan. 27) has no idea what 
he is arguing about. 

First, he doesn't define how 
America Online is a monopoly; 
however, the situation is quite 
clear for Microsoft. Just because a 
company goes out buying other 
companies does not necessarily 
mean it's a monopoly. For exam-
ple, what does AOL buying 
Winamp have to do with being a 
monopoly (or was that Netscape 
buying Winamp?) Anyway, AOL 
is just one aspect of the Internet 
community; it is in no way the 
internet. So even if AOL did own 
an Internet-community-type mar-
ket - ousting competitors like 
CompuServe, Prodigy or MSN -
the consumer would still have a 
choice between local ISp, DSL, 
cable or satellite connections. 

To claim that AOL even comes 
close to being a monopoly isn't 
legitimate. I don't think the world 
would kneel at the foot of AOL 
just because it dominates the 
Internet-community market. 
Microsoft may be the world's 
most hated (yet widely distrib-
uted) OS for desktop computers, 
but there are alternatives like 
8eOS, Linux and FreeBSD. The 
consumer now has the choice of 
whether to learn this new OS. It is 
quite possible to build your own 
computer, Microsoft-free. No one 
ever said you had to go buy a 
Compaq, IBM, Dell or Gateway. 

Frankly, I think there are too 
many people who say "MS 
sucks" without giving a legiti-
mate reason.

ANGELOU: 
Maya drew a sold-
out crowd last year 
cantIIl.'" froIIt ..... 1 
this year's graduation. Twenty-
five thousand of that amount, 
will go to Angelou for speaking. 

Langley said that with 
Angelou's fee, it will be a chal-
lenge to stay within the budget. 
He added that the campus may 
look for sponsorships to help 
fund the ceremony. 

Angelou spoke at RIMAe 
Arena last winter and was greet-
ed with a sold-out crowd. 
Khullar was one of the individu-
als present in the audience. 

"How quickly the show sold 
out speaks to her popularity," he 
said. "Her messages of unity 
and risin~ to the occasion blew 
me away. , 

Langley said he is confident 
that Angelou is a good choice for 
an all-campus commencement 
speaker for many reasons. 

"She is ideal of what we had 
in mind," he said. "She is not 
jUst a name, because most names 
don't have her depth, passion 
and expressive abilities. She is 
certainly someone of substance 
and stature." 

Ln Khullar 's eyes, signing 
Angelou not only assured a good 
speaker for this year 's com-
mencement, but also set a good 
example for the years to come. 

"This has set a precedent on 
campus," he said. "There will 
certainly be a lot of pressure to 
continue this if it is successful, 
like I think it will be." 

Despite his current optimistic 
views, KhuUar said he was ini-
tially afraid the commencement 
would not take place this year, 
and not happen in the future. 

") was scared for the future," 
he said. "Once we lost it, there 
would be no way of getting it 
back." 

Over the last two years, the

that this event will be 
well-attended as a 
result of Angelou)s 
popularity and all the 
hard work that has been 
put into acquiring her 
as a speaker. 

all-campus commencement has 
been met with controversy and 
decreasing attendance; two 
years ago, students demonstrat-
ed against the selection of for-
mer House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich. 

Last year, Irwin Jacobs, 
founder and CEO of Qualcomm, 
spoke at the all-campus com-
mencement to a smaller crowd 
than anticipated, which further 
led to Langley's concern over the 
importance of an aU-campus 
commencement. 

Khullar and Mantell wanted 
an all-campus commencement 
this year, but could not confirm a 
speaker by the deadline. For this 
reason, Langley initially recom-
mended canceling the all-cam-
pus commencement, but eventu-

ally reversed his decision. 
"What changed my mind was 

the personal commitment that 
[Khullar and Mantell] had to 
make it work," Langley said. 
"They said they would step for-
ward, and that is exactly what 
you want to see on a college 
campus. We decided to give it 
another try." 

However, the future of the 
all-campus commencement is 
still unknown, as the porularity 
of this year's event wil dictate 
what happens for the years to 
come. 

"This is still an experiment," 
Langley said. "This is the fourth 
year of the all-c~mpus com-
mencement, and we need to see 
if students actually want this. 
We are keeping our fingers 
crossed." 

Khullar said he expects that 
this event will be welf-attended 
as a result of Angelou's popular-
ity and all the hard work that 
has been put into acquiring her 
as a speaker. However, he said 
that the process has also been 
one of great difficulty and frus-
tration. 

"The worst part was having 
to wait all this time for the 
agents," he said, "but the end 
result was certainly worth it." 

Regardles.~ of the difficulties 
that have surrounded this year's 
commencement, Khullar 
remains pleased that all five col-
leges will graduate together. 

"Here at UCSD we have five 
colleges and one community," 
he said. "However, at gradua-
tion, I think we should graduate 
as one community and not just 
five colleges."

DepreSSion, although a very serious 
problem for college age students, is 

becoming more treatable 

DEALING WITH 
I n the past 10 years, new approaches to dis-cussing depression have developed in response to the increasing awareness Ameri-cans have about the disease. Approximately 1800 UCSD students came in for counselLin last year, and he believes that presently 10-~ 
percent of the students on campus are affected by 
depression, according to John Giebink, director of 
UCSD's Psychological and Counseling Services. 

Giebink S!'id that many of these student1l don't 
even realize that they have depression. 

"It's hard to saY, because people come in for a 
variety of reasons, ' Giebink said. "A person might 
come in because of academic problems, unable to 
concentrate or study, but then if you talk to them it 
might tum out that they're depressed also." 

'kesean:hers for the World Health Qrxanization 
predict that by 2020, depression will be tfie greatest 
illness to people in the developlng world and that 
severe depression will be the second 1argest cause 
of death and disability. 
DIP ' • DI,n 111.1 

In medical tenns, depression is known as -clini-
cal depression" because it is a specific illness that 
requires clinical intervention. Most people believe 
that depression suggests a transient diacourage-
ment or sadness, but many doctors believe that it is 
real!y a i'6Vasive and persistent state of pain and 
dystunction. 

Depression can begin at any age and vary wide-
ly in its course, severity, and predominant symp-
toms, according to Harold Bloomfield and Peter 
McWilliams, authors of the book, How to Htill 
Dqnmion. Studies show that more young people 
are getting depressed. 

There are three primary types of depression -
major, chronic and manic. 

Major depression has a beginning, a middle and 
an end, can last for months and will recur if left 
untreated. Each recurrence tends to last longer and 
is more debilitating than the one before. 

Chronic depression is a low-grade, long-term 
depression that can go on for years. This is also 
caned dysthymia. 

Patients suffering from rnanic-depreuion expe-
rience both extreme elation and extreme depra-
sian; they are often physically self-destructive. This 

In medical terms) depression is known 
as «clinical depression» because it is a 
specific illness that requires clinical 
intervention. Most people believe that 
depression suggests mere transient 
discouragement or sadness, but many 
doctors believe that it is really a 
pervasive and persisting state of pain 
and dysfunction. 
is also called bipolar depression because a person's 
emotional poles can fluctuate up and down in 
unpredictable, rapid swings. 
...... 

The direct and indirect costs of depression range 
up to $53 billion per year, according to www.dtpm-
sion-net.com. Approximately one in four women 
and one in 10 men can expect to develop depres- I 
sion during their lifetime. Also, one in SO children 
under 12 and one in 20 teen-agers are affected by 
depression. 

It is estimated that approximately half of all 
cases of depression are unrecognized and untreat-
ed, and 10-15 percent of depressed people take 
their own lives. 

Suicide Awareness/Voices of Education, an 
organization dedicated to educating the public 
about suicide prevention, states that 30,000 people 
kill themselves in the U. S. every year; however, it 
is estimated that the actual figure may be three 
times that number due to inaccurate reporting. 
Ninety-five percent of all suicides occur at the peak 
of a depressive episode, reported the lou""" Of ~ 
Amniclln Mtdica' Ass0ci4tion. 

Suicides among adolescents in the last three 
decades rose from eight in 100,000 to 24 in 100,000, 
according to Harold Bloomfield. 
., .. 1 ••• 

There are many symptoms for depression. They 
range from a persistent, sad or empty mood to a 
loss of interest In activities once enjoyed. Other 

symptoms include too much, or not enough sleep, 
unexplained weight loss or gain, restlessness, irri-
tability and fatigue, as well as several others. 

If you experience five or more of these symp-
toms for longer than two weeks, or if the symptoms 
are severe enough to interfere with your daily rou-
tine, you should see a doctor or a qualified menIal 
health professional immediately. 
I' ........ 

Fortunately, depression is not all bad news. 
Studies have shown that 80 percent of people with 
depresSion can be successfully treated, reports ' 
www.depression .about.com. These treatments include 
medication, psychotherapy and self-help. 

The three main types of anti-depressant are tri-
cyclic antidepressants - monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors, serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and 
bupropion. These anti-depressants target specific 
brain systems that use monamine neurotra~mit­
ters and enhance their functions . 

Sunlight is also helpful for treating depression, 
according to researchers at the Mayo foundation 
for Medical Education and Research. Patients with 
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), can use a new 
form of therapy with light, called phototherapy. 

"Scientists think fewer hours of sunlight may 
increase levels of melatonin, a brain hormone 
thought to induce sleep and depress mood," report 
Mayo researchers. "Treatment with a specialized 
type of bright light, which suppresses production 
of melatonin, seems to help some people with this 
disorder." 

Psychotherapy is also another option. There are 
two categories of psychotherapy. The first is talking 
therapy - the therapist uses verbal exchanges to 
help patients gain insight into and resolve their 
problems. The second is behavioral therapy -
where patients learn new behaviors that will help 
them improve their lifestyle and unlearn their 
counter-productive behaviors. 

There are also self-help methods. Many sufferers 
participate in support groups where individuals 
can surround themselves with other people in the 
same situation. 

Even if a treatment is successful, depression

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Defending the other white meat from an onslaught of religious propriety 

WARD HAN 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Something has been bugging 
me for a long time, so please, lis-
ten to my complaints - it' ll make 
me feel better. 

joined him in attacking my habit. 
My temper flared, and I 

screamed, "1 don't care if it's your 
shit and my shit combined with 
yo' mama's shit, I'm still eating 
it. " 

I usually don't feel that strong-
ly about my eating habits, but 1 
felt very defensive when my 
roommates harassed me about 
what 1 was eating just because 
their religions forbid the con-
sumption of pork. 

One argument they offered 
was that the feces pigs eat gets 
trapped in their bodies and col-
lects over time. That is just ridicu-

ly does stay in my body after I eat 
it, the next time I want an organ 
donation I should ask for pig 
parts since one third of my body 
weight is probably pure pork. 

My roommates main argu-
ment was that because pigs eat 
their feces, they are feces. Hence, 
anyone eating pigs would then be 
eating feces. 

First of all, to all of you non-
pork eaters out there, pork smells 
nothing like poop. And while 1 
have never tasted poop, I can still 
tell you pork tastes nothing like 
it. 

My roommates' pork-is-crap 

bon dioxide we breathe. Nature 
recycles all the elements year 
after year. 

If my roommates' pigs-are-
crap argument was valid, we 
should not eat vegetables, either. 
After all, vegetables U eat" feces, 
too. Anyone who has been in the 
central valley has smelled 
manure fertilizer and thus knows 
this. In fact, vegetable and fruits 
consume much more feces than 
pigs do. Farmers buy cow 
manure in tons, but my room-
mates don't seem to mind broc-
coli and apples. 

I completely respect the Judaic 

mates interpret their religion too 
literally. They should question the 
reasoning behind traditions 
instead of following them blindly. 
They are certainly blind to facts, 
and even worse, they make up 
bogus "scientific" truths to sup-
port their traditions. If they are 
willing to make up bogus facts to 
support something as trivial as 
eating habits, they will certainly 
make up scientific facts to sup-
port more importiU1l issues. 

I have to get something off my 
chest about pork. A few days ago, 
my roommate from last year saw 
me eating beef and thought that it 
was pork. Being Jewish, he is not 
allowed to consume pork, so he 
decided to be a jerk and attempt-
ed to make me stop eating pig 
meat. 

I usually don)t feel that strongly about my eating habits, but I felt very 
defensive when my roommates harassed me about what I WIIS ellting just 
because their culture forbids the consumption of pork. 

In physical science, bogus facts 
are easy to distinguish from well-
supported ones. However, if my 
roommates gave me bogus socio-
logical or anecdotal .evidence to 
support their points, there is no 
way I can know if they are lying. 
Their misrepresentation of facts 
to support their religious beliefs, 
in my eyes, cheapens the value of 
the important teachings the two 
andent religions have to offer. 

" Do you know what you're 
eating here? I bet I can make 'Iou 
throw up by telling you what sin 
that stuff," he said. 

After sharing a room with him 
for a year and knowing how self-
righteous he was, I knew I was 
about to be lectured on the feces-
eating nature of the animal I like 
to eat. I was particularly upset 
because he conjured up argu-
ments and made them sound like 
scientifically sound evidence that 
should dissuade me from eating 
pork. 

To make matters worse, my 
other roommate, who is Muslim, 

lous. Adult pigs probably eat 
about 10 pounds of food every 
day. That would mean that in the 
course of a year, a pig would eat 
3650 pounds of food. Even if one 
tenth of it were feces, that would 
mean that a pig gains 365 pounds 
of crap in a year. Something tells 
me my roommates were making 
that one up. 

One roommate also told me 
the pork was going straight to my 
arteries to clog them. According 
to him, pig products stay in my 
body and never leave. 

First of all, I didn't realize that 
there were pieces of pork floating 
in my blood. Second, if pork reaf-

,\IZl'" \ 

argument really ticked off the sci-
ence-loving side of me. As a 
chemistry major, I'd like to point 
out that mammalian digestion 
works by breaking nutrients 
down to their molecular level, 
anct then the molecules are 
absorbed into the bloodstream. 

Any feces that pigs eat would 
be broken down to amino acids, 
proteins and mineral ions. The 
protein molecules in crap are 
identical to the ones in our body 
parts. After all, there is no special 
element on the periodic table 
called u crap." The carbon and 
nitrogen molecules in crap are 

. the same as the nitrogen and car-

and Muslim religions. There are 
probably very good reasons why 
people of these faiths do not eat 
pork. Pork contains trichinosis 
and worms that can be deadly to 
anyone who eats undercooked 
chops, for example. However, 
with modem stoves and proper 
cooking techniques, pork is no 
more dangerous than lettuce. 
Actually, pork is probably a lot 
less dangerous than lettuce since 
lettuce is generally eaten raw. 
Food poisoning cases from

trichinosis.

liquids on Monday morning. Use the 
plastic cups then. From Tuesday 
through Thursday, you're way too 
busy. Romance is compelling, but 
your work has to get done, too. 
Don't worry; you'll find a way, espe-
cially on Wednesday. Friday and Sat-
urday are better for wor1< than for 
play. On Sunday, listen to your 
mate. He or she has a great idea 
that's still in the development 
stage. Be supportive. 

LIBRA 
Sept. 23 - Oct. 22 

On Monday, get together with 
friends or close relatives to learn 
something interesting. Don't let it 
interfere with your wor1<, however. 
From Tuesday through Thursday, 
your attention is required at home. 
Making your place more beautiful 
will actually help you think more 
clearly. Romantic commitments are 
apt to happen on Friday and Satur-
day, so be in the right place with the 
right person then, Your creativity is 
likely to flourish on Sunday. Make 
the most of it. 

SCORPIO 
Oct. 24 - Nov. 21 

Take care of your money on 
Monday. Spend in haste and 
repent at your le isure. From Tues-
day through Thursday, you'll learn 
best by practiCing. Get somebody 
who already knows to show you 
how. Stick close to home on Friday 
and Saturday. Those are also good 
days to buy domestic appliances 
or computers . Let your sweetheart 
or the kids push you around on 
Sunday. You 'll love it and so will 
they. 

SAGITTARIUS 
ov. 22 - Dec. 21 

You feel great on Monday, but 
take care. Haste could make waste 
- or cause an accident at home. 
From Tuesday through Thursday, 
focus on finances. Draw up a bud-
get that you can live with . On Friday 
and Saturday, you 're absolutely bril-
liant. Tackle your most difficult 
assignment then . On Sunday, relax 
at home with somebody who push- . 
es you to be more sensitive. It'll be 
good for both of you. 

FEATURES 11 

CAPRICORN 
Dec. 22 -Jan. 19 

You could discover a buried trea-
sure on Monday. Hunt for it. From 
Tuesday through Thursday, the 
moon 's in your sign. That always 
makes you more confident, so do 
something that will bring in more 
money. Count it on Friday and Satur-
day. You 'll be in the mood to make 
financial decisions then, too. On Su~ 
day, a visit with neighbors could be 
interesting, if somewhat confronta-
tional. All in good humor, right? 

AQUARIUS 
Jan. 20 - Feb. 18 

Don't waste your money on Mo~ 
day, even if your friend has fallen on 
hard times. Don 't let somebody 
else 's mistake get you into trouble. 
From Tuesday through Wednesday, 
keep your own counsel. You have a 
few things to think over in private . 
Then, on Friday and Saturday, you 
can make your big decisions, know· 
ing you 've done the homewor1<. Buy 
yourself a special treat on Sunday. 

PISCES 
Feb. 19 - March 20 

Entertain an unexpected request 
on Sunday. Don't do it until you 've 
thought it over carefully, though. 
From Tuesday through Thursday, a 
social outing could lead to a lasting 
friendship, especially Wednesday. 
Practice your affirmations on Friday 
and Saturday and convince yourself 
they're true. If·you can do that, you 'll 
take off like a rocket on Sunday. 

BIRTHDAYS 
Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 

Jan . 31: Playing with a new team 
wor1<s well this year. You 're an idea· 
generating machine.

Too Many Athletes 
Lead Criminal Lives 

Sports fans already know 
that a significant percentage of 
professional athletes' salaries 
goes di rectly to the govern-
ment. So does a great deal of 
their time in the form of prison 
sentences and community ser-
vice following the heavy fines 
they pay when they break the 
law. 

We' re not talking about 
petty parking violations. 
We' re talking about overt 
violations of the law, viola-
tions that make national 
headlines, and which threat-
en the sanctity of athletes as 
role models fo r American 
youth. 

Carolina Pa nthers' wide 
receiver Ray Carruth is being 
indicted on double murder 
charges, which could send 
hi m to prison for many 
years. 

By the time he will be eli-
gible fo r release, the Super 
Bowl will be celebrating its 
centennial, and he'll most 
likely have rotted in jail in the 
meantime. Double murder! 
He should have been a line-
backer. 

Another example of ath-
letes dabbling in criminal 
activity: Eugene Robinson of 
the Atlanta Falcons was arrest-
ed for soliciting oral sex from a 
prostitute (who happened to 
be an undercover cop) during 
last year's Super Bowl week-
end in Miami. 

Tough luck, Robinson. 
Pursuing a "good time" ended 
up being more costly for the 
Falcon than he coulJ have pre-
dicted. 

Unfortunately, news of 
this was broadcast to a 
worldwide audience during 
the actual Super Bowl. The 
situation undoubtedly dis-
tracted him and his team. 
Denver Bronco receivers 
burned him a couple times 
for big plays. 

The latest example of a 
malevolent alter-ego surfacing 
in a professional athlete is that 
of New York Ranger Kevin 
Stevens. 

Stevens, long removed 
from his glory days as an all-
star in the NHL, was discov-
ered in his motel room this 
weekend with cocaine, crack 
and drug paraphernaHas. As a 
result, he's facing felony drug 
charges and his career is in 
doubt. If he goes to prison, he 
will be leaving a wjfe and two 
children behind. 

Undoubtedly, Stevens 
must have a strong character 
to have made it to the NHL, 
but as we've seen with other 
professional athletes, power, 
wealth and fame corrupt. 
Other, perhaps hidden, 
aspects of a person's character 
can surface when life becomes 
more carefree due to 
decreased financial strain as 
well as the accomplishment of 
lifelong goals. 

Stevens wasn't involved in 
such illegal activities when he 
was leading the league in

Baseball Opens New Season 
IEROIC: Ninth inning Addison homer leads UCSD to a 3-1 win over CSULA in season opener 
By REID MONASTER 
Staff Writer 

With the smell of hot dogs lin-
gering in the air, it was a perfect 
day for baseball, and it couldn't 
have been scripted any better for 
the Tritons as they took on Cal 
State Los Angeles' Golden Eagles 
for a doubre-header at Triton 
Field on Saturday. 

If the first game of the year is 
any indication of where a team 
will stand at season's end after a 
time of trial and tribulation, the 
Tritons have a lot to look forward 
to. 

"The game had a little bit of 
everything," said Triton Head 
Coach Dan O'Brien about the first 
game of the year, 

The Tritons scored early on a 
Chris Tallman shot to center, 
allowing third baseman Chad 
Addison to come around and-
score. 

Usa Huff/ Gu8rd1." From there the Tritons were led by the heroic pitching of 
sophomore right-hander John 
Beaven, who kept the Golden 
Eagle bats quiet while pitching 
six innings with five strikeouts 
and one walk. Beaven gave up 
only five hits (none of which were 
for extra bases) while allowing 
only one run on a wild pitch in 
the sixth.

"Today was the first game I 
really felt comfortable," Beaven 
said. "I tried to stay within myself 
and get ahead of guys." 

Golden Eagle pitcher Mike 
Burns threw a solid game as 
well,and didn't allow a single run 
after the first inning. He pitched 
seven innings, allowing only two 
hits and one run and struCK out

''I'm proud of our guys," 
O'Brien said. "They didn't get too 
high, and didn't get too low. They 
played consistent baseball:' 

In game two, the Golden Eagle
