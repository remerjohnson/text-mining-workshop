. Construction financed 
By MARIKO TAKAYASU. SacramenlO Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO - A bill that 
would provide a mechanism for 
the University of California to 
construct and rennovate social 
science and humanities 
buildings, including the Pacific 
Rim Graduate School in San 
Diego, was approved by the 
Senate Education Committee on 
Wednesday.

libraries." Arditli said . 

"For the last 10 years, there 
has been a major, major facility 
backlog at UC with increased 
student enrollment, we are going 
to need to meet those addei:! 
demands," Arditti said . 

The bill would also give the 
State Public Works Board 
authority to provide temporary 
financing from sources available 
to the state's colleges and 
universities until It can sell the 
bonds for a speci fic project. 

"Since it takes the board a 
while to sell bonds. this change 

in state law would allow the 
board more flexibility so they 
can sell the bonds to take 
advantage of market conditions ," 
Petris said . 

"Presently there is nm a 
mechanism to allow temporary 
financing. The bill would allow 
those institiutions or the general 
fund to be the sources for 
fincancing. Also, the legislation 
would allow the legislature at the 
time it authorizes construction of 
a project, to reimburse the 
university for the costs of

drawings which may have been 
advanced by that segment. 

"If UC wants to put up the 
money for the planning and 
working drawings to get a project 
going and if and when the 
legislature actually approves the 
contract, UC wil have the 
mechanism by which it can 
collect reimbursement," said 
Felice Tanenbaum, legislative 
consultatnt to Petris. 

However, UC would assume a 
risk under this provision because 
the legislature may not approve 
the project. ~ 

Sen. Nicholas Petris, D-
Oakland, authored the bill lhat 
would allow the State Public 
Works Board to provide revenue 
bonds to the state's colleges and 
universities for the construction 
of general and "insructional" 
facilities. 

The state should make 
available a full range of financial 
options, including revenue bonds 
to meet the increasing demand 
for space over the next 20 years , 
Petris said. The state borrows 
money by purchasing revenue 
bonds from the private seCtor to 
finance construction of university 
facilities. The university, in turn , 
assumes the responsibility to pay 
back those loans. UC relies upon 
the probability that the state will 
allocate funds in their annual 
budget to repay those loans. 

Pulitzer author spoke at UtSD 
Under existing law, revenue 

bonds can be used to construct 
high technology faCilities, 
research facilites and libraries, 
with the approval of the 
legislature . 

This bill, SB 1493, would 
extend the law to include general 
instructional facilities , including 
the rennovation of Social Science 
Unit lJ at UC Irvine and Hart 
Hall at UC Davis and the 
construction of the Pacific Rim 
Graduate School at UC San 
Diego. 

"This additional use of 
revenue bond financing is 
important because there is a 
need for increasing the number 
of instructional facilities as 
enrollment increases at UC and 
other institutions of higher 
learning," Petris told the 
committee. 

Under Gov. Deukmejian's 
proposed 1986-87 budget, $140 
million would be allocated for 
building construction and 
rennovation . 

"All but $28 million of the 
proposed funds comes via these 
bonds," UC administration 
lobbyist Steve Arditti said. That 
means. $112 million would go to 
the construction or rennovation 
of high technology and research 
facilities and libraries. 

The revenue bond financing 
has been the primary means by 
which construction has been 
funded by UC for the last twO 
years. 

·More than $300 million has 
been authorized by the 
legislature in two years for 
construction ," Arditti said. "or 
that, two-thirds has come from 
these bonds," he said. 

By the year 2000, about 30,000 
more students are expected to 
enter Uc. ·UC has a 1m of aging

FRANCES ITZGERALD, the 45 year old Pulitzer Prize winning author of 
Fir.e in the Lilke: The Vietnamese 
and the Americans in Vietnam , 
lectured on her upcoming book, 
(Cities on a Hill) to a room of 
faculty and students last week. 

Fitzgerald's topic of discussion 
was entitled "New American 
Social Experiments," and is 
derived from her latest work 
which investigates four unrelated 
communities which have evolved 
in this country during the past 
two decades. 

These groups include: the 
Rajneesh commune, once located 
in Antelope Oregon that has 
since been dismantled; Jerry 
Falwell's Fundamentalist Church; 
the Sun City retirement 
community, located outside of 
Tampa, Florida; and the "CaStro" 

district gay community in San 
Francisco. 

Fitzgerald's means for 
discussion of these topiCS 
included, "The distinctive 
process of social change in this 
COUntry" and defining ·what is 
American about American 
politics." 

When asked why she chose to 
focus her book on these 
particular communities. 
Fitzgerald mentioned her 
pOSition as a visiting lecturer at 
BJ:rkeley in 1978, and the press 
coverage of George Moscone, 
then mayor of San Francisco , 
making an appearance at a "drag 
ball," showing his suppon of the 
continuing gay liberation. 

While teaching at a college in 
Lynchberg, Virgi nia, Fitzgerald 
had a chance meeting with Jerry 
Falwell and , as a result, attended 

a meeting of his fundamentalist 
church, exposing her to one of 
the largest evangelical 
movements in our history, 
Fitzgerald said . 

Fitzgerald's fascinanon With 
"nontraditional human 
communities" led her to Sun 
City, Rorida, where 6.000 
middle class senior citizens built 
a retirement community in 1960 
that "created the COUntry's 
conception of how old age 
should be met."

The tiring tradition of the Greek system 
After nine years of colon ization and installation, the 12 fraternities 

and sororities which are members of the Intrafraternity and Panhellenic 
Councils are burgeoning into an active social power on campus. As they 
continue to thrive within the bored, frustrated and stagnant pop-culture 
here , it is time for you to decide whether or not these organizations are 
worthy of your support . 

Traditionally, "Greek" organizations have openly and obviously 
demonstrated their willingness to accomplish philanthropic acts, and 
they have organ ized many private social gatherings. In the name of such 
social organization, their "Greek Weeks," parties and carnivals have 
provided opportunities for students to engage the Greeks in many types 
of social intercourse. 

supportive and powerless positions when dealing with fraternity men. 
Perhaps the Greeks that we have on campus intend a different sort of 

social establishment than that of their national affiliates and 
predecessors. They may endeavor to improve and make available to 
everyone social activities which will seNe the whole campus. Maybe 
they truly strive to fulfill the philanthropiC and altruistic notions they so 
proudly espouse . Perhaps our "Greeks" will encourage women to attend 
to more than smudged fingernail polish and mixers with fraternity 
members. The sororities themselves may be beginning to encourage 
feminine intellectual and ethical prowess rather than fostering opinions 
and actions which subordinate their members. Hopefully, the true aims 
of the Greeks will become apparent through more inclusive policies, 
more stimulating attitudes and more inviting requirements for 
membership. Such persistence and adherence to voiced claims would be 
admirable. 

In the past, wealthy, caucasian males have centralized their 
dominance over social and political establishments on college campuses 
through their Fraternal Associations. By charging exhorbitant dues and 
imitiation fees, fra ternities have closed themselves to all but the most 
affluent students. Through prejudiced , secret initiations and election 
rites, campus brotherhoods have demonstrated their disdain for 
outsiders. Their hazing practices have also shown that they do not even 
respect the physical or emotional integrity of their own fraternity 
brothers. 

In tum, sorority girls have sought to associate with "e\i.gible" males 
through their own elitist societies. These organizations have encouraged 
both economically-based snobbery and shallow senses of feminine 
identity. Sororities have traditionally acquainted women with methods to 
arrange social and political functions, but they have neither educated 
women about nor provided them access to sources of phYSical or 
intellectual power. Sororities have encouraged their members to take 

Regardless of the desires and hopes of the Greek organizations, you 
must decide on what basis you will conduct your social life. Consider 
.thoughtfully the values and standards by which you organize. Notice the 
ideologies behind and the consequences of the actions you support. In 
your search for identity do not haphazardly invest yourself in any group 
whi h covertly or overtly proposes ethical standards that you cannot 
support with your most lucid , sensitive and integrous thoughts. Racism, 
sexism and elitism must not continue to seep into our SOciety 
unchecked . You owe it to yourself to examine your own morality and to 
avoid blindly supporting trends and institutions which circumduct 
justice. Know what you believe and act accordingly. Do not become just 
another identity-less face attatched to a non-descript body wearing a 
similar sweatshirt.

Greek grudges 

Editor: 
Upon reading John Nee's 

article , "Too close for comfort In 
the Rec Gym ," in the Feb. 13 
edition of the Guardian , our 
entire fraternity became enraged 
over hIS obvious 
misrepresentation of reality. 
Perhaps Mr. ee has a cenain 
grudge against the UCSD chapter 
of Zeta Beta Tau, but that is no 
justification for hI S slanderous 
remarks against our brotherhood. 
We feel that, as the twO people 
most directly responsible for the 
security at the ZBT/ American 
Red Cross Dance-A-Thon . it is 
our duty to set the record , and 
Mr. Nee, straight. 

Mr. ee's article focused 
primarily on what he conSIdered 
to be an inexperienced and 
unprofessional security crew. He 
stated that "there should have 
been profeSSional security ... who 
have had experience dealing 
with crowds." Had Mr. Nee 
checked his facts he would have 
found that our crew was being 
advised by four professional 
security guards and that several 
of our own crew have worked 
crowd control at such events as 
the O lympics , Madonna and 
Motley Crue . Our members were 
attempting to improve on 
security crews that UCSD has 
seen in the past. How can we 
forget the guards at a Missi ng 
Persons concert several years ago 
who sprayed a relatIvely tame 
c rowd with mace? 

Before the Untouchables' 
perfonnance we were warned by 
the stage manager that i[ 
someone from the crowd were to 
Jump on stage, the show would 
be stopped and pOSSIbly 
terminated . Fortunately, our c rew 
was able to avoid any such 
occurence, and the only time the 
s how had to be stopped was 
when someone from the crowd 
grabbed an on-stage mOnitor 
whIch had to be repaIred by the 

stage hands before the show 
ould continue . After the show, 

the Untouchables' road manager, 
Greg Cometa , commended ZBT 
on the secumy, and several of 
[he band members saId that they 
were pleased with our crew. A 
musiCIan from the band FIction 
commented that our event was 
not only well organized but had 
"some of the best secunty at a 
UCSD event in a long time." 

We beheve that had Mr. Nee 
researched this matter he would 
have found [hat nOl only did our 
crew do an excellent Job, but that 
most of the spectators and 
performers had the same 
opmion We find it extremely 
msultlng that Mr. ee decided to 
wnte this biased anicIe without 
speaking to anyone directly 
Im'olved In the event. It IS our 
hope that in the future , the 
Guardwn and ItS wnters will 
attempt true , Ullblased 
journalism, where stories a re 
based on facts and not on 
personal vendettas.

Reagan's "correct vision" 
Editor: 

It seems to me that I must 
have read the phrase 
"conservative blindness" in the 
Guardian dozens of times, oflen 
relating to indIviduals who 
subscribe to a phIlosophy of 
liberty and limited government. 
However, the Guardian's edItorial 
on President Reagan 's State of 
the Unton speech (2/ 10/ 86) 
makes It clear that it is the 
liberals and leftists th at refuse to 
open their eyes and see the 
failure of our gove rnment's social 
welfare programs. 

Your edltonal complams that 
President Reagan refuses to tax 
"the right people ," those being 
"the member of the wealthy 

class." Obviously, you have 
succumbed to the myth that we 
only need to take more money 
from the rich [0 solve aU the 
problems of the poor. The fact is 
that 90 percent of the tax !low is 
from incomes under $35,000 per 
year, despite our progressive tax

system. Even if we were to take 
all the "extra" money from the 
rich we could hardly pay for all 
our failing welfare p rogra ms. If 
we were to draw a "wealth line" 
at $75,000 and make the 
marginal tax rate 100 percent; 
that is to say, if we confiscated 
every dollar of income over 
$75,000 a year, we would only 
generate an additional $20 
billion in revenue. Enough to run 
the government a whopping 7.2 
days. 

The ed itorial writers of the 
Guardian would have people 
believe that social spendi ng CutS 
by President Reagan are 
responsible for an increase in 
poveny. Yet those who are nOt 
myopi C can see that poverty has 
been increasing even through the 
tenns of Democratic presidents 
and vears of a Congress 

controlled by the Democratic 
Party. In his book, Losing Ground, 
Charles Murray points out that 
from 1960 to 1980, the United 
Sta tes had an astronomic 
increase in social spending,

to $313 billion in 1980. (And 
even under mean 01' President 
Reagan it will rise to $477 billion 
in 1987.) Even after adjusting for 
inflation, by 1980 the spending 
on various social programs had 
increased from four to 25 times 
their 1960 levels. Yet during the 
same period , despite the billions 
poured into social welfare , the 
number of people below the 
poverty line increased by 8.3 
percent. There is absolutely no 
correlation between an increase in 
social spending and a decline in 
poverty. If anyth ing, the opposite

When words are weapons 
The UCSD poltce know that 

words are indeed weapons. For 
they are using words as weapons 
in their conti nuing effort to 
harass, and ultimately repress, 
UCSO's anti-apartheid and 
divestment movement 
spearheaded by the Coalition for 
a Free South Africa . You might 
remember their first attack last 
OctOber when UCSD police 
arres ted and subseque ntly 
released twO Coalition members 
- one ~f whorn was Russell 
Andalcio - for posting flyers 
advenismg October II - the 
day in solidanry with political 
prisoners in South AfrICa . The 
university, one cop told the 

arre~ted , dIdn't like the contents 
of the flyer. 

Once agam , Russell Anda1clO. 
IS the focus of the atte ntion of 
the UC D pohc;.e . O~ d:u 

occasion , he has been charged 
wi th four viola tions. The most 
senous charge is for a violation 
of the California penal code , 
namely "Lynching: Prompting 
others to assault university police 
offi cers ." The three remaining 
charges, 1) "Threats of violence 
or conduct that threatens the 
health or safety of any person on 
university property: prompting 
other persons to assaul t ca mpus 
police offi cers"; 2) "PartiCIpation 
in a disturbance o f the peace on 
university property"; J) "Failure 
to comply with directions of a 
university ofri cial in the 
perfonnance of their duty ," are 
violations of the Student 
Co nduct Code. The cl1arge..have 
been levelled at Andalclo in 
connection WIth the mcident 
which oc urred outSIde the 
p,ymnasium after B ~bpp Tu!u's 

lecture to the UCSD community 
on jan. 23 , 1986. The 
administration alleges that 
Andalcio was solely responsible 
for inciting the crowd to force 
the police to relinquish an 
individual who, minutes before , 
had attempted to tear down the 
racist sign held by evangelisr 
"Brother Jed ." The preacher had 
been provoking .th ose who had

In defense of the Greek system lfTTfRslUTfRS 
By GREG McCAMBRIDGE 

UCSD is a unique university, It 
is nor SDSU. It is not UCLA. It is 
nor Berkeley. We have always 
taken pride in the fac t that we 
are different from these larger, 
more established institutions. So 
what, we argue, if we don't have 
a football team ? What we do 
have is a young, growing campus 
In which opportunities -
academic, extracurricular, etc. -
abound . We have over 130 
student organizations which 
represent many differe nt ethnic, 
political, academic and religious 
groups. Twelve of these student 
organizations are fraternities and 
sororities. It is unfortunate that 
these Greek organizations have 
been met with such violent 
opposition dunng their so far 
brief tenure at UCSD. 

It is unfortunate because the 
"open-minded" people who 
provide this opposition fail to 
realize something. Greeks at 
UCSD have been given a unique 
opportunity; the opportunity to 
create tradition. More 
importantly, Greeks have seized 
this opportunity and taken full 
advantage of it. The Greeks have 
worked long and hard to better 
themselves and the life of the 
university. They have fought an 
uphill battle to justify their 
exi tence to the school 
ad ministration; someth ing which 
has only recently been 
accomplished. Greeks have been 
able to justify their existence 
because they have had the 
opportuniry to look at the 
negative attributes of other Greek 

systems and have thereby 
created safeguards against their 
surfacing here. Instead, Greeks at 
UCSD have implemented the 

good; setting precedents now 
which can only benefit the image 
of the Greek system and of the 
entire univers ity. Greeks on this 
campus want UCSD students to 
be able to say to their friends at 
other universities, "Well, you 
might have problems with 
Greeks at your school, but at 
UCSD we are proud of our Greek 
system." 

Why, you may ask, should we 
be proud of our Greek system? 
Greeks provide more 
philanthropy, community service 
and social events than any other 
student organi za tions on 
campus. The Greek Week 

ph illi nthropy event is going to be 
a 10k run wilh a goal of $10,000 
to be raised for the UCSD Day 
Care Center. Delta Sigma Ph i 
fraternity helps senio r ci tizens in 
La j olla . Phi Delta Theta built the 
par course on cam pus. Greeks 
are often active In the SOURCE 
program. This list goes on. 
Unfortunately, instead of being 
recognized as a pOSitive force on 
campus Greeks are consistently 
regarded as a negative inOuence . 
A prime example, consistent with 
treatment afforded to Greeks by 
almost all UCSD media , is the 
Guardian's "cove rage" of the 
UCSD Charity-Dance-A-Thon , 
sponsored by Zeta Beta Tau 
fratern iry and featuring the 
Untouchables. It is again 
unfo rtunate that an event which 
raised $6,000 for the Red Cross, 
was great publici ty for UCSD and 
a number of student 
organizations which participated , 
and provided an all-too-rare 
campus program on a weekend 
night , was brought to the 
attention of the students by way 
of a negative, inaccurate , 
irresponsible "concert review." It 
is sad to see that the only 
"coverage" of events that Greeks 
put considerable amounts of 
time, money and all-around 
effort into, are conSistently void 
of any intent except to cast an 
und eserved shadow on the 
Greek system. The Greek 
PreSIdent's Council is sponsoring 
a rape awareness seminar on 
March 4 . I am confident that this 
eve nt will be received as a 

response to the recent, tragic 
occurence at SDSU. However, 
thi s event was planned during 
fall quarter for the very reason 
that Greeks here have 
consiste ntly taken preventive 
measures before the fact. Sure, 
nobody's perfect and Greeks will 
make mistakes in undertaking 
theIr endeavors as does 
everybody. However, Greeks are 
making a conscious effort to 
build, through a responsible 
program of expansion, a strong 
Greek system that will be nefit the 
unive rs ity and its undergraduate 
population . 

The 800 Greeks at UCSD ask 
only that they be judged on their 
own merits; nor compared, 
classified or generalized aboul. 
Greek organizations are non-
sectarian student organizations , 
yet they are not funded by your 
activity fees. Everything they do 
is on their own. Before being so 
quick to criticize Greeks, ask 
yourself, have they proVided a 
service for the university? Do 
they raise money for the needy 
charities? Do they th row most of 
the schoolwide parties on 
campus? And then ask yourself 
what you have done for your 
University and community. It IS 
much easier to cri ticize than to 
create. The Greeks at UCSD are 
trying hard to create a system 
that can only benefit the student

is true . Welfare has perpetuated 
poverty and been a direct cause 
of the disintegration of poor 
families. 

Do you ever wonder why they 
don't call it "ReaganomiCS" 
anymore? It's because it's 
working! At 38 months, the 
current recovery is the longest in 
history and the economy 
connnues tcrexpand. Inflation 
has been halted and new jobs 
are being created at the fastest 
rate ever. Five hundred, 
thousand were c reated in january 
alone . Even for minorities, 
unemployment is dropping. 

Yet we must continue the 
program. Government cannot 

. create wealth . it can only 
redi stribute . The creators of 
wealth, jobs, economic growth 
and the opportunity to rise 
above poverty are the 
businessmen , the entrepreneurs 
and "corporate overlords" that 
you disparage. President Reagan 's 
vision of America is correct. The 
program that would best benefit 
all Americans is to "get the 
government off our backs" and 
let the free-enterprise system 
continue our growth. More SOCial 
spending only buys votes , 
enslaves those in poveny and 
punishes those that are most 
deserving of our paradise - the 
creators of wealth .

the UCSD police and 
admimstration. Let' take a look 
at the language of the olTicial 
police report to see how they 
wield them. 

The report is comprised of 
three sections; the first is a form 
which briefly describes the 
nature of the charge, the 
"weapon" ("words") and the 
"motive." The two remaining 
sections are accounts of the 
event written by the twO police 
officers pnmarily involved . The 
first officer's report describes the 

mdividual who attempted to 
appropriate Jed's banner in this 
way: " ... whirl' male about 19 
years of age with shoulder 
length, wavy blonde hair, 
weanng a red plaid longslecve 
flannel shirt and blue denim 
pants." Race, gender, age, hair 
color and type , and clothing are 
spelled out quite specifically. The 
alleged "suspect," on the other 
hand. is a "large black male ," 
described in the act of " ... 
pushing his way through the 
crowd." The absence of any 
deSCriptive language to describe 
"the black," and the acuon which 

THIRD COLIEGt: 
GRADUATING St:NIORS 

he is pcrfotming, establish 
AndalclO as a menacing intruder. 
Without the specifici ty which 
adjectives can provide , the 
reader of the report cannot gel 
any picture of an individual 
human be mg. Instead , Andalcio 
is reduced to a massive force of 
"blackness" which invades the 
crowd of (presumably) white 
people . Once thiS has been 
established , the reader is 
prepared to believe this 
a cusation: "When Andal io 
SlOpped coming toward us he 
began yelling at people in the 
crowd to 'Get them.'" Since the 
language of the repon has 
already onstru ted the "accused" 
as a black menace, it doe$ not 
take mu h 10 convince us of the 

threat which he supposedly 
posed . 

The second officer's report is 
even more detailed with respect 
to the individual seized by the 
police: "The male was white , 
with long wavy blonde hair and 
blue eyes, approximately 5'5", 
125 pounds, and looked like a 
student." This description details 
height, weight and eye color in 
addition to those features 
remembered by Officer #l. 
Andalcio is reduced again to 
"black" and "male." The adjective 
"angry" is also used ; while "large" 
is absent . Instead of establishing 
the "black male" as an immanent 
threat to the safety of the (white) 
officers, as the first report tries to 
d~, this officer relies on highly 

subjective conjecture to clinch 
this supposedly factual statement. 
This officer" ... really felt that 
Russell Adalcio [sic) had the ear 
of the crowd, who reacted to his 
inciting remarks." It should be 
noted that many wimesses are 
ready [Q swear that Andalcio 
made no such remarks. 
Unfortunately, that is not the 
point. For the words of the 
police carry far more weight than 
those of you or me. It is aU the 
more dangerous that the official 
report of the UCSD police 
should rely on such clearly racist 
strategies [Q prove a highly 
dubious, if not completely false, 
case.

UCSD . and the lack of a 
traditional "fraternity row" where 
all Greek housing is grouped 
together, close to campus, he 
said . 

By CHARMAINE HARAVEY, staffWriter 

I IF YOU 'RE LIKE many UCSD students, you may have asked yourself if it's your 
imagination, or reality , that has 
initiated the sighting of many 
more Greek sweatshirts on 
campus. Well, it's true. The 
Greeks are everywhere. About 
800 of them .... 

Currently, there are 12 Greek 
organizations at UCSD, four 
sororities for women and eight 
fraternities for men, not 

includin~ the academic 
fraternities governed by the 
Academic Senate, such as Phi 
Beta Kappa. And many more are 
coming. 

"We support the growth of all 
student organizations because it 
provides the opportunity for 
students to interact with other 
students. We don't give any 
special interest [Q the Greeks," 
said Joe Watson . vice chancellor 
of Undergaduate Affairs , himself 
a member of a black fraternity , 
Phi Beta Sigma, in college. 

Alpha Omicron Pi was the first 
sorority to be installed in the fall 
of 1977, then Sigma Kappa , Delta 
Gamma and recently, Kappa 
Kappa Gamma, this past fall . 
UCSD will gain two 
more sororities in the 
next two and one-half 
to three years. In 1982 
the number of 
applications to go 
through sorority rush 
was 87. This fall it was 
218, the largest yet. 
The rush at UCSD is 
techn icaUy "dry," 
meaning no alcohol at 
rush parties. 

the number of applications to go 
through sorority rush was 87. 
This fall it was 218, the largest 
yet. The rush at UCSD is 
techni ally "dry," meaning no 

successful rush in the spring of 
1985, with 130 applicants, and 
50 (the maximum) selected as 
pledges, she said. 

A "house" must first colonize 
with national backlOg, become 
recognized by their given 

university then be 
approved by the 
national sorority or 
fraternity as a 
chapter. Eight 
fraterni:ies have 
either been installed 
or colonized since 
the fall of 1981. 

The first fraternity 
at UCSD was Phi 
Delta Theta, followed 
by Tau Kappa 
Epsilon , Delta Sigma 
Phi, Zeta Beta Tau, 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon , 
Sigma Nu, Pi Kappa 
Phi and Sigma Kappa 
Mu. The IFC 
constitution will be 
rewritten this spring 
to tighten controls on 
the growth of 
fraternities, said Greg 
McCambridge, 
president of IFe. 

"2 Each fraternity has 
':. an average of 60 

~ men, with a high of 
.£ 90 and a low of 38. 

'What we have here is the 
opponunity 10 stan a tradition," 
McCambridge said . "We don't 
want to be judged by fraternities 
on other campuses. We're really 
trying 10 do something good," he 
said. 

Each national fraternity and 
sorority is affiliated with a 
national philanthropiC 
organization (Ind local chapters 
often have additional 
associations with other 
organizations, NlcCambrdige 
said . TKE, for example, works 
each year with Multiple Sclerosis, 
and AOTT works with the 
Arthritis Foundation. LaSt week, 
ZBT raised approXimately $6,000 
for the Red Cross at their dance-
a-thon, he said . Also, on March 
4, the Presidents' Council 
(presidents of all sororities and 
fraternities) will jointly sponsor a 
rape prevention program, a 
seminar on "rape awareness." 

Unfortunately, though, the 
same stories and rituals 
(regarding alcohol abuse and 
hazing, for example) have been 
passed down for a long time, 
McCambridge said , which 
slanders the good things Greeks 
do. 

The Interfraternity Council 
(lFC) governs the growth of 
fraternities and the National 
Panhellenie Conference (NPC), 
With a council at UC D, governs 
the growth of sororities. These 
organtzations' philosophies and 
locales may account for the 
disparity in expansion policies 
which have left twice as many 
fraternities as sororities on this 
campus. Apparently, this is not 
unusual. 

Anne Pierce, 
preSident of 
Panhellenic, says she 
has pushed N.PC for 
rapid growth at UCSD, 
but with no avail. They 
recommend a full two-
year wait for the 
complete establishment 
of one sorority before 
allowing another to 
join the system, said 
Pierce. KKG had a very

In co ntrast to the previously 
discussed communities, the Sun 
City and the RaJ neesh 
inhabitants tended to .hide from 
the American public, instead of 
tlying to gai n its support , by 
creating separate cities in rural 
areas, Fitzgerald said. Sun City 
residents were referred to as the 
"pioneers of old age ," Fitzgerald

She described the Rajneesh as 

"a type of new age commune 
that includes the '60s commune 
traditions of organic farming, 
recycling wastes, ze n medi ta tion,

Fitzgerald 's continuing 
observations of these 
communities revealed a mainly 
white middle class population 
and involved a process of "being 
born again ," 'coming out," or 
"statting over," Fitzgerald stated.

When looking back upon the

Fitzgerald commented that the 
changes in att itudes and the 
creation of these communities 
"came at a time of great 
prosperity, when people have the 
time to find themselves," and 
added "that in the '60s everyone 
knew that they could get a job,

"jUSt a Greek problem." It's the 
pressure of the college system 
which pushes slUdents to drink, 
according to Randy Woodard , 
director of the Student Activities 
Office. He said it's easier to 
target the Greeks for problems 
such as out-of-hand drinking 
because they are more visible 
than other student groups, with 
lettered sweatshittS and housing. 

"We're striving to give the 
UCSD system a chance, and to 

'have it judged on its own 
merits ," said Woodard . 

One of the best things about 
the Greek system, he added is 
the opportunity for leadership 
development. "This is a campus 
of chOIce and you can choose 
the direction you want," he said. 
Presently AS members Greg 
McCambridge, Jill Lifsehiz, Scott 

Pickett, John Riley, Hayley 
Sneiderman and Bill Eggers are 
all members of the Greek system. 
At UC Berkeley and UCLA, "the 
Greeks rule," Woodard said . 

Students join organizations in 
general because they need 
companionship, said Woodard, 
who oversees all student 
organizations. "Sooner or later 
they will join someth ing. All 
healthy individuals need peer 
support, whether Greek or not," 
he said. 

But some students would 
never consider joining a 
fraternity or sorority. Dawn 
Applegate , a Third College 
student studying visual atts , said 
the whole system is " 100 male 
oriented," besides having a 
superficial basis in looks. clothes 
and money. "It's all based on 
popularity. By contributing to 
this type of organization you're 
contributing to the whole vicious 
cycle ," she said . 

Rex Grady, a senior studying 
history in Muir College, said he, 
too, felt the system promoted 
"locker room" behavior, which he

activities are one redeeming 
aspect of these organizations, but 
this doesn't justify their 
obnoxious behavior, he said. 

This "ideology of exclusivity," 
as some caU it, has been the 

ba~is of much of the criticism 
aimed at Greeks, but 
McCambridge countered , "We 
don't ask people to agree with 
the process of selection ." 

"It's really a mutual selection 
process," said Pierce about 
UCSD's 'dry' rush . If a girl wantS

not discussed . 

Housing is of key concern to 
both Greeks and the

univerSity would not consider 
"co-op" housing for any student 
group until they were satisfied 
with the housing for aU

"Well, then go to the Goodwill Frankie and Annette , through the 

Gidget days, until now with the

schleps on San Diego at Large -
surfers are viewed as only being 
concerned with waves , babes 
and beer, spewing unintelligible 
gibberish like Cowabunga or 
gnarly, and possessing a 
paralyzing fear of employment. 
UCSD surfers are tired of this 
on-going stereotype. 

"I hate the bad image that is 
portrayed in the media, even in 
the Guardian." said Scott 
Campbell , a Revelle senior 
majoring In AMES, and preSident 
of the UCSD Surf Club. "We 
hardly get any mention and 
when we do, It'S always the 
'Yeah, surfi ng's gnarly' bi t. They 
make us seem like a bunch of 
illiterates. " 

Others concurred with 
Campbell 's statement. When they 
start to quote us , aU they write is 
"Wow, radical!" They try to make 
us look like idiots, but if we were 
we wouldn't be in this school," 

Lounging at the weekly SurjClub muting are (from 'eft): Eddie Chan, Richard Zambrano, Shane Ferrel, Eric Gustafson. 

said Damon Rice , a management 
science junior. 

Mike Glevy exemplifies the 
new attitude among collegiate 
surfers. When Glevy's family 
relocated to San Diego from 
Hawaii, he had to make a choice 
about which college to attend, 
and it was one that came fairly 
easy. "( could have gone to either 
San Diego State or UCSD, but [ 
wanted an education, so J chose 
UCSD," said Glevy, who is a 
math computer science major on 

\,. . 

an ROTC scholarship. "Surfing is 
important to me, but you have to 
think about your future and 
UCSD is going to prepare me a 
lot better than State." 

Natuftllly, UCSD's proximity to 
the Pacific Ocean was a lure in 
the choice of schools [or many 
of the surfers. "I never knew that 
Black's was a radical Spot, [jUSt 

.wanted to be near to the ocean," 
said Campbell, known to his 
colleagues as the "Soup Man." "It 
was either going to be Santa 
Barbara or San Diego, and when 
mom goes (raises voice), 'Santa 
Barbara 's too much of a pany 
school: San Diego was the o nly 
place to go." 

Yet straddling the line between 
the books and the beach can at 
times cause a shade of 
imbalance. "We all love to surf," 
said Campbell, "So we schedule 
our classes around surfing." 

"Yeah, no classes before II :' 
said Brad Retcher, a Third 
College biology maJor. "But we 
stili have our goals. Our goals arc 
almost more imponam than our 
surfing, but we'd never give up 
surfing." 

Amongst their surfing peers, 
these UCSD students reven to a 
culture that may seem foreign to 
the average person . Many UCSD 
surfers are nOt unlike other 

surfers in that they use the same 
idiosyncracies and vocabulary of 
the surf culture . But the 
uniqueness of the culture and 
language can also be a sensitive 
issue . 

"I think we should avoid this 
issue altogether because it gets 
back to the negative stereotype," 
said Campbell when asked to 
define some of the surf 
vocabulary. "A lot of words , like 

'gnarly' and 'tubular' are words 
we usc, but if you stan to talk 
about it as a vocabulary, well, [ 
think it's demeaning." 

Campbell ana logized it with 
the language used in some lower 
income black neighborhoods. "If 
you Iisten·to them you might 
think it's a bunch of bullshit; but 
in their psyche, it's a valid 
conversation. (t's a completely 
different dialect." 

The evolution of some of the 
words can prove to be 
fascinating. "Take the word 
'sh red,'" explains Peck Comstock, 
a social coordinator of the UCSD 
Surf Club, "If you go off the top 
of the wave and make 
mincemeat out of it, it's much 
like taking a machete to a head 
of lettuce. just as the lettuce is 
thrown off in little chunks when 
you shred it, the same happens 
to the water when it's shred." 

Nevertheless, surfers are still 
indifferent when they see the use 
of the surf vocabulary for the 
appearance. "I just laup. h when ( 
hear people use worc1s they 
know nothing about," said GIcvy,

The vague mumblings 
of an abused bag lady 
By MELISSA WEINSTEIN 

DURING THE frequent vexations and vacillations of adolescent pubeny, the 
average youth becomes stubborn 
and opinionated and suddenly 
becomes the center pivot of the 
universe . I saw a clan of these 
types - a tribe , in their own 
rites of pre-teendome. They 
gathered around a wall - an 
intangible wall of tench. A fetid , 
Invisible barrier which was so 
obvious that it was beyond 
gagging. The odor became a part 
of the main swing of 
conversation among the puss-
faced individuals , and they 
delighted upon belching and 
shouting at the source of the 
omnipresent smell. 

The mumblings of the bag lady 
seemed to amuse the adolescents 
even more than abusing her [or 
her odor; in some capt ivatingly 
odd way, the profundi ty of the 
vagrant was curious. "My brother 
has a pig farm in New jersey," 
her scra tchy voice rasped. 

The youths were delighted in 
this statement as a unison of 
squeals rose above their heads 
and echoed in the parking lot. 

The wrinkled-faced nomad 
then informed her audience that 
she had a Ph .D in psychology. 
She pointed a long fi nger at each 
greasy face and told them that 
they were her next subjects for 
experimentation . 

This last statement was 
followed with a practically 
deafening and disrespectful 
belch from the tallest boy in the 
assembly. And , in the sman-ass-
not-even-humorous manner that 
some young limber teenagers 
StOp short of patting themselves 
on the back for, a whiny voice in 
the back inqUired as to what her 
father did for a living, and 
whether she received an 
allowance. 

The group giggled 
symphonically, climaxing into 
al most mad laugh ter, continui ng 
into a diminuendo of chuckles. 

I observed the swift 
man nerisms of this fema le 
vagabond and imagined a herd 
of confusion trampli ng th rough 
her mind splattered wi th pa int. 
Inexplicable , I though t. I 
contrad icted myself as I mentally 
commented that the bag lady is 
a part of socierx while at the 
same time is also an outcast. 

Her tattered clmhing was piled 
on layer upon layer. As one 
knee-high stocking st reched to 
its highest locus on her hairy, 
bony k nee, th e o ther lay lim p in 
waves of wrin kles at her thick 
ankle . 

Blocking out from my mind 
the herd of screaming youth , I 
focused on th e ign oble bag lady. 
Rustling a hand coated with din 
and fi ngemail jam th rough the 
raggedy brown bag, she 
mysteriously pulled out objects 
which were incompreshens ible 
to anyone but herself The bags 
were her life; her collections 
were her occupation. To feel a 
wave of empathy was impOSSible; 
a touch of sympathy WclS more 
viable. 

My friend emphatically stated, 
"Sh," could always ge t an 
assembly-line job." I thought. "An 
assemb ly line job - talk about 

the epitome of banality." 
The bag lady got her treasures 

together. Her droopy grey eyes 
coordinated with her olive-
colored, almost caricatured face. 
The hardness of this face 
revealed decades of wear and 
tear, with gristly, glamourless 
pieces of hair scattered a round 
the frame . Her lack of posture 
was undoubtedly due to the 
weight of her possessions within 
the depths of her bags. 

She appeared disgruntled as 
she continued with her curious 
throaty mumblings and as if 
suddenly struck by a glorious 
revelation, her face twitched 
uncontrollably. 

One scrawny pubescent , who 
undoubtedly had not developed 
a single underarm hair, 1 thought 
to myself, parodied the 
wanderer's walk while gracefully 
pinching the end of his nose. 

The vulgar c ruelty of 
adolescence made my stomach 
tum. 

"Your fathers are whore-

mongers," she mumbled without 
stopping. She ambled on and on, 
pausing only to peek over the 
rim of a trash can, peering into 
the realm of its dark and rancid 
depths . 

She released a shopping bag 
from her finn grip and 
relentlessly searched through the 
can's innermost remnants. When 
nmhing in the contai ner 
stausfied her, she continued on , 
cautiously placi ng equal weight 
on each foot With every step. 

Her rootS lay in some dime 
tore mystery novel ; her presen e 

was intngumg. She paused once 
more to mold the phlegm in her 
throat into a ball of spit - then 
to skillfully release it. The group 
of kids continued their confused 
giggling even in her absence . 

A cynic might tell her to get a 
job, a realist might think of her 
as a prod uct of society; and a 
hopeless dreamer might say that 
she's just caught up in her own 
off-the-wall individualistic 
idealism. I!J

"People don't realize what 
surfing is like ," said Campbell. 
"Grandma can go out and ski in 
an hour. Grandma can also go 
out and learn to windsurf in an 
hour. Almost any uncoordinated 
person can learn most sports like 
this. But in surfing it takes 
months so you can just tolerate 
it. So why do you do it? For the 
full adrenaline rush ." 

surfer entrenched as an AMES 
major at Third Collcge. Every 
wave is different. It 's not like 
baseball ." 

amidst the guffaws. "We only do 
it once a meeting." 

The UCSD surf team docs 
fairly well at surf contests, having 
placed sixth in the 16-team 
National Scholastic Surfing 
Association meet held at Mission 
Beach. Because the AS happily 
funds the surf team to be 
involved in these contests, they 
are staunch supporters of AS 
President Mary Rose Alexander. 
"We love Mary Rose! " cried a few 

of the surfers. 
The Surf Club also has taken 

ventures into scrvi ng the 
commumty. "Every few weeks 
we'll go out and have a trash 
pickup at Black's so it 'll look 
clean ," said Comstock. 

"But then again ," interrupted 
Campbell. "if it has green scum 
sticking Out of it, then it would 
be gnarly." 

"Yeah ," intervened Rice, "You 
nev r catch the same wave." 

The room once again explodes 
with laughter. Yet there are Olher 
misconceptions about surfing 
that at times can be a bit thorny. 

Therc was a pause as evcryone 
thought about the statement. 
Then , once again th e explosion 
of laughter followed . 

As a di verse group of students, 
they still hold that comon bond 
in their love for surfing. "Wc're 
fraternal in the symbolic sense , 
but we 're nothing like a "Every time you go surfing, it's 

different, says Dave Pillsbury a

surfers is that we say stuff like

"You're still here?" 
By PHIL LAUDER 

[ 
AST YEAR I was walking 
towards the Guardian 
offices when .some 

custodian walked up to me and 
said, "Man , you have been here 
for-tYfr!!" 
. "Me?" I asked, somewhat taken 
aback. "No, you're probably 
mis.taking me for someone else." 

"No, no, I'm sure it's you. 
Yeah, it's you all right! God. how 
long have you been here?! Five, 
ten years?!" 

"YOUR MAMA!!! You've got the 
wrong guy!! later, paJ!" I screamed, 
storming into the office . 

I was pretty shaken. He probably 
did have the wrong guy. Then 
agai n, I had been here a long time. 

When I first gOt to UCSD, I 
planned to graduate by the age 
of 20. In fact , before the age of 
20. I knew it was a lofty goal , but 
I liked getting things done 
quickly - I had graduated from 
high school at 16, and I was 
ready to be done with education 
as fast as humanly possible. 

Then one day as I was walking 
up the steps to the graduation 
stage to get my diploma , I 
tripped and fell into an 
enormous abyss known as the 
Guardian. My life would never be 
the same agai n. Bye-bye 20-year-
old graduate. No biggie, I 
thought, I'm doing somethi ng I 
like. School is more than mere 
academics. All work and no play 
makes Johnny a dull boy. It also 
throws him into the real world at 
far too young an age. H'ey babe , 
take a walk on the Wild side. 

Now it's February 1985. a year 
after that custodian told me I 
was an ancient species. last 
September I had planned to 

I 

graduate in Junc . I had it all 
figured out. No more screwing 
around - time to get serious, 
buddy. Four classes in fall, four 
in winter, and five (one of which 
was pass-no pass) in spring. No 
problema. I've got this joint wired. 
Graduate in June , search for a 
job in July, stan work and buy a 
house with a fenced yard and 
two-car gl\,/1lge in August. 

Yeah , right. 
My plans have, yet again , been 

aboned . I got a better offer. So, 
now I'll be graduating in 1987 -
June , to be exact. I think. -

I take great consolation in the 
fact that I'm not alone. Not even 
close. Most of us don't bank on 
atte nding UCSD on the ten-year 
plan . But that's the way it often

works out. Drop a class here. go 
pan-time there , maybe take a 
quaner off now and then to 
avoid burnout and see the world . 
Perhaps the Cal Grant runs out 
- so you get a job at 
McDonald 's for a quaner or twO 
before coming back to school. 
Voild . Forget four years. Forget 
five . Try anywhere between 
seven and ten. Ponrait of a 
career student. 

It's a partern of success toO 
many of us follow. At the 
Guardian , I don't know if anyone 
will graduate in four years. I 
don't know if anyone ever has 
- somebody must have. 
Honestly, some people have been 
here so long, one has to wonder 
if they really want to get out of

here at all or it they're just here 
to see the Sights and cruise 
through life on Mommy and 
Daddy's bank roll . 

As I write this, however, I 
realize that some may be 
thinking that about me. There's a 
soberi ng thought. I swear, I do 
plan to graduate. I will graduate. 
I will. Soon. In relative terms, 

Tuesday, February 18. 1986 13 
FEATURES 

soon. Do you know that if you 
squeeze the history of the eanh 
into a calendar year, humans 
don't appear until after 8:30 pm 
on December 31? You bet 11l be 
graduating soon. 

The only way to deal with 
sc hool on the eight- to ten-year 
plan is to rationalize like crazy. 
"What's the big hurry?" you 
begin . "Why rush things? Why 
jam everything into four years? 
Why make my grades suffer and 
make my body hate me? Why?! 
What's the big deal? Lots of 
people graduate a lot older than I 
will. They do just fine! Why cao't 
I? I know it's more expensive to 
go through school this way, but 
what's the sense of saving money 
if you're going to hate life? I'm 
going to slow down, take life as 
it comes, and graduate when I 
graduate." 

After a while UCSD feels like a 
jail cell - believe me . And , as 
yet one more projected 
graduating date falls by the 
wayside, one feels as if one is 
reaching for the keys to get the 
hell out of here - reaching and 
grasping - and can 't quite seem 
to reach them. Most of us don't 
give up. Even if we should. 

I hope you find a coat hanger. 
See you in '87. ~

NAU shows no love 
B?.uAYs!l~~,!!n~ 's Day 
NORTHERN Arizona University cruised into Triton Pavilion Friday 
night and used some major 
league altillery to blast UCSD 75-
41 in a basketball version of the 
St. Valentine's Day Massacre. 
Most coaches might find a loss 
of this propoltion discouraging, 
but UCSD coach judy Malone 
was almost overjoyed. 

"It's sure was a valiant effolt." 
said Malone. "We played some 
good defense and our team 
husded all game long. If we play 
like this against San Bernardino. 
I guarantee we'll Wln ." The 
reason [or Malone's unusual 
satisfaction after such a 
convincing loss lies In the fact 
that there wasn't any doubt as to . 
who was going to win , so any 
encouraging aspect of the Triton 
game plan was cause for 
celebration. 

Yet simply put. th is game was 
over d UrIng warmups. Nolthern 
ArIzona is a DIvIsIon I school. 
ha VIng beaten strong teams like 
Arizona State and BYU. 
Fulthermore , never has a team's 
nickname been more 
appropriate. The LumbelJacks 
were towering physi al 
speci mens - possessing a front 
line averaging well over 6' and a 
5'10" point guard . orthern 
Arizona used theIr Paul Bunyan-
esque size to dominate the 
inside game, scorIng viltUally at 
WIll agains t the smaller DIVISIOn 
III Tritons. 

SurpriSingly UCSD, with the 
inside play of jennifer Gregory 
and some outside bomos from 
guard Tracy Ragatz , stayed 
within striking distance , traihng 
36-22 at halftime. 

But in the 'second half, the 
Lumberjacks shIfted into 
overdrive , employing a stifling 
half COUIt press that left the 
Tritons in a state of chaos. NAU 
piled up points off subsequent 
UCSD turnovers and nailed the 
coffin shut. 

Lumberjack head coach Dave 
Brown admitted he had the 
better team, but he was also 
impressed with the Tritons'

scrappiness. "UCSD is, in my 
opinion, a real good ballclub. 
They hustled all over the court 
and kept our girls on their toes 
all night. It was a real good 
workout for us." 

The glaring weakness that has 
plagued the Tritons all year has 
been the inability to hit the 
outside jumpshot, and the game 
against the Lumberjacks was no 
different. Without any decent 
shooters, opposing teams pack 
In theIr defenses , rendering the 
Triton inside force of Heidi 
jungling and jennifer Gregory 
virtually helpless. No Triton 
scored in double figures and 
jungling was held to nine points. 

With no hopes for post-season play, UCSD coach Judy Malone and assistanrs Jan Martin and Don Elder sir 
and play out the string.

some dope tripped and fell on 
my left leg. My cleats dug iri and 
someone gave me a good shove 
on the right shoulder. I spun, but 
the lower half of my leg didn't. 

Snap! 
The sound didn 't come 

through my ears but vibrated up 
my thigh , through my spine and 

on the knee and the leverage 
produced by long leg bones. The 
knee is, to begin with , a weight-
bearing joint at the center of two 
long "lever-arms," said Hirshman. 
Then when compared to the hip, . 
which has a solid, ball and 
socket construction , or the ankle , 
which is riot subjected to the 
same stresses, the knee is poorly 
constructed for sports. "(The

primarily in one place , like a 
hinged jOi nt, but it is stressed in 
other directi ons with a great deal 
of force," said Hirshman. 

According to Hirshman, knee 
injuries happen two ways. There 
are stress related injuries, like 
those often associated with 
runners who overdo it. The most 
common of these is irritation of 
the kneecap from overuse. There 
are also traumatic injuries

the leg, like those associated 
with football and skiing. What I 
had , he explained , as he inserted 
a two-inch needle and collected 
200cc's of blood from my Jello-y-
knee , was one of the traumatic 
type injuries. 

Traumatic knee. injuries can be 
further classed into severeal 
categories. The worst among 
them is a knee fracture which is 
relatively rare in SpOrts. The least 
serious injuries are known 
collectively as "sprains." 

It is the soft tissues, the 
cartilage and the ligaments, 
which serve to stabi hze the knee 
that get the brunt of the damage. 
Tearing of the so-called cartilage , 

actua lly the meniscus, which 
separates and helps to stabilize 
the two halves of the knee is the 
most common traumatic injury. 
Tom cartilage often leads to 
problems in the knees later 10 
life , especially arthritis . It's 
tearing of the ligaments, 
especially the famous anterior 
cruciate ligament (ACL), which 
has a reputation as a career-
ending trauma for professional 
athletes. Some unfortunates also 
tear the medial ruciate ligament 
along with the meniscus, a 
co mbination known as the 
"te rrible rriad" in sporting circles. 
Kellen Winslow's tom ACL put 
him out of work for a yea r. Joe 
Namath's famous knees were

famous because of the terrible 
triads in both . So at least my 
own terrible triad put me in 
good company. 

Therapy, arthroscopy and THE 
KNIFE 

Knee repair comes in three 
packages, depending on what's 
damaged . Knee spr;ains and 
stress pains are often treated just 
with therapy, which involves 
exercise, ultra-sound massage 
and sometimes medication. 
Therapy is also an important 
part of recovering from more 
serious knee injuries. 

In the last five years ca rtilage 
mjuries and even incomplete 
ligament tears have been the

Hark! I hear a pin drop 

Has Triton Pavilion been quarantined? You would think so if 
you wandered in during an athletic event. Except for a sprinkling 
of a few hardcore followers , rows of empty bleachers are 
commonplace. Fan support for UCSD athletics is going the way of 
the Edsel and the Laser Disc , and for a school of 14,000 students, 
not only is it embarrassing, it's almost tragic. 

Palt of the college experience is backing the various athletic 
programs on campus. Tiny colleges like Westmont and Claremont-
Mudd have brought impressive throngs to UCSD to root for their 
teams. Yet students might complai n that due to academic pressure, 
attending any sort of athletic game is asking too much. This may 
be well and true, but other schools with comparable and eve n 
more strenuous academic curricula have been rabid supporters of 
their own athletic programs. . 

The real problem may lie in UCSD's frugal policy of not hiring 
full-time coaches. Being a school of 14,000 students, UCSD should 
be cleaning up in every sport of Division Ill. Yet the reason UCSD 
is getting beat by the religiOUS colleges of the world may he In the 
fact that part-time coaches must worry about putting food on the 
table and thus cannot fully concentrate on their athletic programs. 

Granted, finding the money to hire full time coaches may not 
be the easiest of tasks. Students, once again, hold the key. Free up 
some of the registration fees, get better coaching and the wining 
teams will come. The athletic department must also. as swim 
coach Bill Morgan says, "make a little more noise" to try to get 
some of this money. Only when the intercollegiate teams stalt 
cleaning up in Division III can UCSD make the jump to Division l. 
But until then , don't hold your breath. 
Sunday afternoon at the fights 

In a game that often resembled Saturday night at the fights, the 
Celtics and Lakers beat up on each other in a thriller, the Celtics 
winning on a TKO, 105-99. 

Superior rebounding, better scori ng off the bench and better 
guard production helped Boston maintain a lead that seemed 
insurmountable going down the stretch. But the Celtics could not 
apply the knockout punch until one minute was left in the final 
round when the Lakers swung and missed with a flurry of three 
point bombs that did more damage to the iron than the Celtics. 

Boston shut down the vaunted LA fast-break by pounding the 
Doards and the Lakers. Tempers flared in the second quarter when 
designated hit man Greg "what's a basketball" Kite was sent in to 
beat up on Kareem. Earlier, frustrated Byron "the mouth" Scott 
tried to readjust Jerry Schichting's tie - from the face down -
and drew a technical which set the tone for the remainder of the 
game. The difference, however, was a mellow red dead head 
named Walton, who served notice that LA's road to repeating still 
goes through Boston. 

Knees 
Continued from page 16 
benefiCiary of a revolution in 
medicine known as arthroscopy. 
Where previously such injuries 
could not be treated without 
open knee surgery and long and 
painful periods of recovery 
which often outweighed the 
benefits of the operation , now 
they are done on an outpatient 
basis (much like having wisdom 
teeth pulled). Using three tubes 
inserted through tiny holes in 
the knee , a fiber-optics camera 
lens and light source , a vacuum, 
and a "tool," doctors can now go 
into the knee and remove tom 
cart ilage , repair some, and sew 
up minor ligament tears. Within 
a few days people are walking. 
running and so-on. The 
procedure is so routine that 
often case~ are reported of 
people running marathons and 
playing professional sPOrtS 
within twO weeks of their 
surgery. 

A complete ligament tear IS a 
serious injury to an active 
person . The ligaments are the 
primary source of stability in the 
knee and a tom one can leave a 
severely wobbly Joint which is 
difficult to use and is more 
prone to further injury. But 
treatment requires open surgery 
and some serious cutting and 
pasti ng. It's no mistake to think 
about giving up serious 
basketball, football , raquetball , 
tennis, surfing, windsurfing, 
skiing, soccer, rugby and Twister 
in favor of going under the knife . 
Complete recovery from surgery 
takes a year with regular therapy.

"If it is only the ACL that is 
tom- there are twO options-
operate or not. Some people do 
well without the surgery, but they 
can start damaging other things," 
Hirshman advises. "In a middle-
aged person , I would not 
recommend fixing it. whereas, to 
a young person it may be worth 
the opera tion and the 
re habilitation .... If a patient has 
(a terrible triad), reasons become 

stronger to operate ... results of 
non-operating are less good ." 

Miracles of modem medicine 
The surgery I had involved the 

doctor's cutting my leg open 
from the lower third of my thigh 
to the middle of my shin. He cut 
a strip of tendon from in front of 
my kneecap and built a new 
"ligament" on my knee, screwing 
it into place on the opposing 
bone ends. Eventually, the 
tendon will be replaced by a new 
growth ligament of unpredictable 
strength . He also sewed up my:

I was out of the hospi rtal in a 
week, but I remained strapped 
much of the next three into one 
of the lates t advances in knee 
surgery known as Continuous 
Passive Motion (CPM or 
Continuous Pain Machine) 
whic h is deSigned to improve 
post opera tive flexibility . Kellen 
Winslow used one of these 
machines after his ACL 

reconstruction and wa back on 
the field in record time. 

Other medical advances which 
I was a little too early to take 
advantage of include the use of a 
hamstring instead of the kneecap 
tendon for ligament repair, and 
the possibility of althroscopic 
ligament repair, .which Hirshman 
said WIll probably eventually 
come to replace open surgery. 
The use of cadaver palts and 
synthetic materials is also being 
studied. But, "Right now, I 
wouldn't have any of them put in

hightest standard of living that the world has ever seen, 
there are persons who begin and end each day unsure of 
where their next meal will be coming from. And while 
action has been taken to help end hunger in developing 
nations, our own citizens, in the United States - in San 
Diego - seem to have had their needs overlooked. 
With this as our motivation, the undersigned students 
of UCSD pledge to give up their dinner meal on 
Thursday, March 6, with the money saved by Housing 
and Food Services to be donated to the San Diego Food 
Bank for use as it sees most fit. Thank you for your 
committment to helping those hungry people in our 
"own backyard." 

Commuter students are also encouraged to 
participate by donating what amount of money they 
can. Look for petition tables to be set up soon. 
Sponsored by ASUCSD.
