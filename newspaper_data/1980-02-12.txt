- . " CAR~ER REGISTRATION PLANS 
DRAW 2,500 TO UCSD PROTEST 
SaxC)n Message 
Means $1500 
T uilion Possible 

By Carolyn Friday 
Sacramento Correspondent 

Arguing vehemently that an actual 30 percent 
budget reduction for the University of California is 
"beyond imagination," UC President David Saxon 
sent Governor Brown a contingency Jarvis II budget 
which calls for $193 million to be generated in tuition 
revenues. 

"The university has already been squeezed to the 
limits and beyond," Saxo told the governor in a letter 
dated Feb. 7. 

"Aeross the country and throughout the world, it is 
widely believed that the quality o~ the university has 
been seriously diminished and that it is greatly further 
threatened," the letter reads. 

Saxon said he could not provide detailed 
information about the specific budget cuts. Instead, 
the UC President outlined a broad picture showing 
how the university would cut $290 million from the 
$966 million 1980-81 budget Brown presented to 
the legislature last month. 

One-third of the $290 million cut (or $96 million) 
would be achieved through base budget reductions, 
and the remaining two-thirds - $194 million -
would be raised through tuition. 

Figures released to the UC Board of Regents show 
the university has subdivided the one-third budget 
cuts. More than $70 million would come from 
university programs and $25 million from programs 
support, which is money the state provides for faculty 
salaries based on the 17.5: 1 facultv·student ratio.

It took 15 minutes for the line of protesters, four to 
six abreast, to pass Urey Hall, and they extended in 
an unbroken line from the Muir ba~ketball courts to 
Argo Hall on Revelle. 

The windows in central library , campus 
administration buildings and many classrooms were 
filled with onlookers. 

And most of the 2 ,500 marchers stayed to listen to 
nine speakers blast President Carter and his proposal 
to register 18 to 20-year-olds for the draft. 

"How the fuck does it feel to be Exxon's hostage? 
How the fuck does' it feel t6 be Jimmy Carter's 
host8{{e?" literature p.rofessor Saul Steier cried ' in a 
Bob Dylan-like rasp. 

"The reason you want to refuse is that it's not in 
your interests. It's in someone else's interest, and you · 
have got to refuse to fight for their interests. 

"Your labor as students is to learn, so your job is to 
object and educate other people about why you 
object," Steier said. 

David Harris, former Stanford student body 
president and an anti·war activist who spent 20 
months in jail on draft evasion charges, was no less 
strident than Steier. 

"No politician in America ought to be allowed to lie 
to American youth for his own political purposes. 
President Carter ought to be punished for his 
actions," he said before the rally. ' 

Later , he said Carter was escalating a small 
conflict. and suggested that "we can guarantee arms 
to the Afghanis and let them shoot Russians in the 
hills for the next 50 years. There doesn' t need to be a 
nucl E'ar war or a big armed conflict." 

And. he warned , "it is no accident that he adopted 
the 'Cartf'r doctrine' at the same time as the draft. He 
intE'nds to use it. " 

Rick Nadeau , a Sociology graduate student, told 
the c!' l.wd that organization was the key to success in 
11101'11"1 " r('~istration for thl' dra ft . 

" I: ':; nice to see so many people here. It's a real 

deja vu feeling, but this time, let's go beyond what the 
60s did, and stop the military from getting us back 
here in 10 years," Nadeau told the cheering crowd., 

"The 60s," and how anti·war rallies then 
compared to now wason the minds of most of the 
participants. 

Old·time chants like "Hell no, we won't go, " "1·2· 
3·4, We don't want your fucking war" and "Don't 
enlist, resist" were repeated all during the rally, and 
"War is Not Healthy for Children and Other Livinfl

Studen~ Rights In

The purpoae of thi. letter i. to take a look at rtudent and 
faculty righb. As a .tudent, did you ever fed that your rights had 
been abused or even defined? Did you follow guideline. for one

only to run up against a brick wall, or did you set the run. 
around? Did you give up beeaute it Wat too much of a haule? If 
any of this hib home, read on. 

My UCSD experience betan in the fall of 1977, and as I'll be 
the first to admit I took the cautious and undeclared approach. 
After a year of "muaical maio"" and two quarte!s abroad, I · 
knew what I wanted out of coOege: A major that I was good at 
and a degree from UCSD. Giving credit to what studentl have to 
go through to achieve theae goals 0011 of patience, late nights 
andaome pretty rough times), is it not correct to allume that we 
have certain defined righta? Yes, in fact we do, and these rights 
cannot be violated. 

According to my experiences and thOle 01 other students, let's 
take a look at the following two situations: 

-A student, having succes.fully completed a course 
according to the guideliner ret up by the professor, is faced with a 
problem. Hi. performance throughout the quarter was poor, so 
'!e deeided to tighten hi. belt and get that A by scoring on the 
final. Ready to start the next quarter our student is infonned th~t 
yea, his efforta were rewarded and he got an Aon the final . But 
due to perfonnance discrepancy alone the student is advised to 
take a second final. Does the .tudent .ubmit himself to thi. 
arbitrary decision, or does he have a ret of guidelines, agreed 
upon, to point to and say that he is within hi. righta not to submit? 

-A lludent, having succellfully completed ~ course 
accorcing to the guidelines ret up by the professor, i. faced with a 
problem. Hi. performance throughout the quarter was excellent, 
but by lOme fluke he totally fail. the final. In light of situation, i. 
the .tudent juttified when he requesll a aecond final, or does tha 
proferlOr have a ret of guidelines, agreed upon, to point to and 
.. ~ he is within hi. ",hta to deny the request? 

1heae are not totally unrealistic situationa, and are merely 
apecific examplea 01 a wide variety of in.tancer of atudent.

The problem. anticipated

On there grounds we feel 
that badminton player. have

Iran Won't Insist 
On Shah's Return 

IRAN - Iranian Preaident Abolhassan Bani·Sadr was 
quoted yesterday by a French newspaper as saying his 
government is no longer demanding return of the deposed shah 
before the release of the American hostages which could occur 
"perh'!P8 even in the coming days." 

In Tehran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini marked the first 
annivertary 01 hiS Islamic revolution in Iran by vowing to 
continue battle against "the ruthless devourer," the United 
States. He made no mention of the hostages, who marked their 
l00th day in captivity. 

Masses of jubilant Iranians celebrated the revolution's 
anniversary with a victory parade through Tehran. The crush 
was so great a grandstand collapsed, killing one person and 
injuring 66 persons, including four who were hospitalized, 
Tehran radio said. It said three other persons in the crowd were 
killed when they were hit by a tank during the parade of security 
forces. 

According to the Paris newspaper Le Monde, Bani·Sadr said 
the release of the hostages was possible, "perhaps even the 
coming days," if the U.S. government acknowledged its 
"crimes" in Iran over the past quarter century and pledged to 
stay out of Iranian affiars_ It ·must also recognize Iran's right to 
"obtain the extradition of the shah and the restitution of his 
fortunes," Bani·Sadr was quoted as saying. He said he was 
waiting for Khomeini to make a deci.ion on the proposal, 
perhaps in the next few days. The militant's 0 . ion on the 
proposal was not known. 

The official Paris news agency said Bani·Sadr ha been 
misquoted but did not say what the alleged misquote was. 

In Washington, State Department spokesman Hodding 
Carter said the United States will not "profess guilt" for its record 
in Iran as part of a deal to win release of the hostages. Carter 
ruled out that possibility when he was asked about the statement 
by Bani-Sadr. Carter had no further comments on the American 
efforts to release the hostages. 

According to the newspaper, Bani·Sadr also said: 
- He had made a separate proposal that the Americans be 

removed in the next few days from the guard of the Islamic 
militants to a third party. He said that, too, would have to be 
approved by the Revolutionary Council which he heads as well 
as by Khomeini. '

DOONESBURY 

State Demos Ask 
Less War Talk 

LOS ANGELES - The 
board of the California 
Democratic Council has 
passed a resolution urging 
President Carter to avoid 
creating "a climate" that 
would support military action 
in the Persian Gulf and a 
possible war with the Soviet 
Union. 

The board's resolution 
instead urged Carter to 
negotiate a peaceful solution 
with the Soviets, Afghanistan 
and Iran. The action came 
during the board's pre-
convention meeting Saturday 
night. 

Board spokeswoman Ruth 
Ehrlich said the group called 
on the United States, China 
and Great Britain to withdraw 
their support for Afghan rebels 
in exchange for the withdrawal 
of Soviet forces from 
Afghanistan. 

The resolution further states 
that U.S_ foreign policy 
"should not be aimed at 
arming the People's ' Republic 
of China and undertaking a 
partnership of war against the 
Soviet Union, since this · even 
more than the situation in 
Afghanistan - is the biggest 

emphasized the board's stand 
against military regi.tration 
and the draft, further 
acceleration of the arms race 
and increased defense 
spending. 

Instead, "people· to· people 
exchanges are an important 
element in averting a nuclear 
confrontation that will destroy 
us all," the resolution stated .

Other CampusRallies 
Same Day, But Only 

Ber~(eley's as Big 
By Kathy Huffer 

Yesterday's rally at UCSD 
may have been the largest of 
the numerous anti·draft 
protests held at -campuses 
across the state. 

Most of the rallies, 
coordinated yesterday to send 
President Carter an anti.draft 
message from the West Coast, 
drew crowds of less than 
1,500, less than the 2,500 
protesters gathered .here. 

Crowd count estimates 
varied widely among the 
media and police, but the only 
rally attracting a crowd similar 
in size to UCSD was at 
Berkeley, where between 
1,500 (according to campus 
police) and 4,000 (The Daily 
Californian) demonstrators 
listened to Daniel EUsberg, 
who gained prominence in the 
60s for leaking the Pentagon 
Papers to the New York 
Times and in the 70s for his 
anti-nuclear power activities. 

At UCLA, which has the 
largest enrollment in the UC 
system, only about 400 
protesters showed up for an 
uneventful rally. 

UC Santa Barbara drew a 
crowd of approximately 1,500 
to a short-lived rally. Only 
three speakers took their tum 

before police dispersed the 
crowd because an anonymous 
caller said there was a bomb in 
fI nearby building. 

No bomb was found, and 
the group continued their 
protest by marching on 
campus. Some protesters also 
burned old draft cards. 

There were no reports of 
injuries or damage from the 
campus rallies, as students 
from the UC and Cal State 
systems and other universities 
heard speakers callout against 
reinstitution of the draft 
registration. 

The most prominent 
~aker at the UC rallies was 
EUsberg. 

He said the "draft is 
irrelevant," because any war 
in the Mideast would rely on 
nudear weapons rather than 
combat soldiers. 

Urging students to "distrust 
the cult of leadership," 
Ellsberg said, "No one can tell 
you you have an obligation to 
kill another human being." 

After EUsberg and several 
other activists spoke at the 
noon rally, about 500 
demonstrators fell to the 
ground for a two·minute "die-

in." After getting back on their 
leet, the demonstrators sang 
folk songs. 

At UC Davis, nearly 1,500 
protesters congregated to hear 
several speakers, and at San 
Diego State, about 350 
students rallied on the student 
center steps. 

Cal State Fullerton reported _ 
a crowd of about 200, and Cal 
State Sacramento featured 
Campaign for Economic 
Democracy chair Tom 
Hayden and attracted close to 
1,500 students, the Fullerton 
student newspaper reported. 

Anti-Draft Rally 
Continued (rom (>age 4 
crowd of 500 stayed behind to listen to the speaker 
denounce the organizers as "sell outs." 

Montalvo said afterwards that the VV A W were 
trying to use the rally for their own purpoles, not to 
oppose the draft, and "Jori," a Students for Peace 
representative, warned the crowd during the raDy 
that "we're here to fight against the draft, not to let 
any organization take control or pulh political 
philosophies . 

This is a long, long struggle, and we have to start 
working on strategy, tactics and goals."

sa)'l Hagen. "Neither i. it a 
Ie.-ned or emotional etiology,. 
.. the AAAS findingl bear 
out." 

Hagen believes that 
ltuttering it caUied by a 
combination of facton. 
According to him, "The 
cIiIorder i. IOmewhere in the 
neawolotic:a1 rnechaniIm that

and larynx 'must work in 
conjunction with each other for 
dear .peech. If the timing il oU 
clue to a neurological or 
congenital malfunction, the 
person wiD .tutter, " Hagen 
explain.. 

Hagen went on to tell how, 

in the twentieth century, there 
have been many di.parate 
theori.. on the origin of 
Muttering. The molt common 
theory .tat .. that .tuHering is 
a "hy.terical conver.ion of 
neurom.," in other worda, a 
purdy p'ychological problem. 

By 1950, though, .tuHering 
wu believed to lie a learned 
behavior de.cribed a. a 
"cloaed-cyde, aelf-rewarding 
.y.tem" curable only by 
exterllive p'ychotherapy. 

"Unfortunately,' .ay. 
Hagen, "wlust was overlooked 
was that the ltuttering itadf 
was the cau.. of the emotional 
problema, not the other way 
around." _ 

Today'l medical conaen-
lUI-arid the one to which 
Hagen .ubecribel-teem. to 
be a combination of all of the 
previous theories. 

Hagen .treuel the 
importance of treating the 
actuaJ diIorder of ItuHering, 
not jutt the symptom. of 
anxiety which accompany it. 
"In the majority of easea, 
lpeech therapy can bring the 
adult or child to a point where 
he or .he can .peak Ouently, 
but a .tutterer i. never free of 
the potential to .tutter." 

Speech therapy, Hagen 
l8ya, can UluaJly hdp the 
stutterer to have normal 
conversation. without thinking 
about hil di.ability. However, 
therapy aIao teache •• tutterer. 

Hypno.is has been 
tried without much IUCCell,

The object of .peech 
therapy is to train the facial 
and tongue mu.dea to work in 
conjunction with each other. 

Student Grade Rights 
Continued from page 2 
faculty dashes. The examples 
might be totally different from 
an experience that you migt 
have had except for one thing: 
~u knew you were right. 
That's a good start, but where 
do you ~o from there? Firat of 
all, don t ever underestimate 
your situation. You have your 
rights, and until a more 
efficient process is established: 

-Get your evidence 
together (pull out tho.e 
guideline. ); 

--Don't get yourself 
involved in a departmental 
quarrd-aave younelf tome

provost, p,.ent your cue .. 
dearly AI poMibie (point to 
thoae guidelines) and «Jon't pi 
.idetracked-you cfid 
everything by the book; You 
have your rights and they wiD 
be recognized. 

Up until now the word 
appeal has been Uled in very 
general term. and u.ually 
mean. a lot of time, but it 

doesn't have to. If everyone 
reacted according to the 
procedure above, I believe 
that the administration would 
begin to notice that more 
abuae goes on than they 
realized. Academic depart-
ments would be under pressure 
to take a closer look at both 
aides of the issue before 
making any type of arbitrary 
decilion. 

If we worked together in this 
way, we could find out just 
how much of a problem we 
actually have, and set -up a 
rapid, unthreatening griev-
ance procedure to deal with 
any type of academic 
problem. 

I'm working through the 
adinistration now to try and 
bring about .uch a change, 
and what i. needed now is 
lome student input and 
support. If you have any 
que.tion. or an unulual 
situation fed free to get in 
touch with Bob W. Spielmann 
through the Allociated 
Students.

White House to Brief UC Presidents 
AS President Carloa Montalvo and at least 

tlvee other UC Itudent body presidents will 
attend a day long meeting at the White House 
Friday with President Carter and his aides, 
Montalvo said yesterday. 

Montalvo said that he had received an 
invitation by mailgram Thursday ni~ht from the 
oHice of Anne Wexler, a Carter aide. 

The student lobby told him that an invitation 
had been sent to the UCLA president, and a 
reporter for . The Daily Californian, the 
Berkeley student paper, said yesterday that the 
AS presidents of his school and Davis were also 
invited. 

The two could not be reached for comment. 
Montalvo said the schedule he received 

aaIIed for meetings from 9:30 am Friday lO 
5:00 pm with Carter national security and 
domestic policy aides, then an East Room 
reception ~ the president. 

Montalvo said he hoped to concentrate on 
Carter'l foreign policy views and their 
relationship with Carter's recently flnnounced 
plan to register men and women for the draft. 

Montalvo was critical of Carter at 

yesterday's anti· registration rally, accusing 
Carter of using registration for the draft as a 
cynical tool to further his own re.election, and 
said that. he was thinking of joining a UC 
walkout of the meeting. 

"There are questions about how serious this 
is going to be, but it appears that its gOIng to be 
the first time he 's reaching out to get our 
opinion," he said. -

"We're going to get together after the 
meeting and put together a formal statement on 
the meeting afterwards. "

AS President Carlos Montalvo' at yesterday'. rally. 

If Jarvis II Passes, UC Fees 
In 'For $1500 Rise Next Year 

The reaalta 01 the rally were plain enough, but it was difficult to 
tell if the dau walkout called (or by organizers was making any 
headway. 

At least.orne duses were called off. In a few cases midterms 
were even cancelled. 

z.e..a Marris, Warren sociology senior, said, "Our teacher iust 
called off OW midterm 10 we dosed our blue books and came 
outIide." 

And a chemical engineering sophomore at the rally who asked. 
not to be identified, laid One professor "cancelled the midtenn for 
today - Chern 141." The class met for a lecture, however, and 
one other atudent in the clan who stayed didn't think many were 
miuing. 

Of c:oune not all profeuora were 10 cooperative. A statistics 
d .. 1 on Muir campus went ahead with a test at 1 pm. 

A spot check of classes in session at that hour found very few 
had loat students to the rally. -

Mick Shoemaker, Muir history senior, said he had just gotten 
out of a midterm, "The professor said there would be plenty of 
time to attend the rally," he reported. 

It was announced in advance that rally participants would try to 
convince students in class to leave, but no such efforts were in 
evidence. Apparently the most important factor in the success of a 
walkout is the aid of the professors. 

Continued from page 1 
For the projected tuition, rough calculations 

produced a minimum $1500 annual tuition 
figure without even taking into account 
enrollment loss or increased financial aid needs. 

At a $1,500 tuition level, the UC budget 
oHice estimates it wiD lost 8,000 of its student 
population of 130,000. 

Increasing tuition to $1,500 will 
automatically generate a need for another $93 
million for student financial aid. 

Added to the $193 million the university 
hopes to raise from tuition, the individual UC 
student can expect to pay $2,500 tuition next 
year if Jarvis II passes and if the governor 
insists on 30 percent budget reductions to UC. 

David Schontz, UC Student lobby co· 
director, feels Saxon is severely 
underestimating the ipact on enrollment loss. 

"To raise tuition that high is much more 
damaging than to have the university make 
more program cuts or raise money from the 

one· time financial deal," Schontz said. 
"Of course my feelings are based on 

conjecture, but thinking of myself as a student 
and in talking with a lot of other students, there 
is serious talk about "stepping out" for a while 
until the dust settles rather than paying $2,500 
tuition," the UC lobby co·director said. 

Neither Saxon's letter to Brown nor the 
confidential advisory memorandum UC Vice 
President Thomas Jenkins sent to Finance 
Director Mary Ann Graves mentioned precise 
tuition or financial aid figures, according to a 
Department of Finance spokesman. 

"We were not given any of the details such as 
how much tuition UC could charge or would 
charge or how much student financial aid it 
would need," Graves said.
