attorney's office said charges will be 
filed against a San Diego State 
University male who allegedly raped a 
Grossmont College student after a SDSU 
fratemity party last month . 

Prosecutors declined to pursue the 
case due to insuffiCient evidence and 
the unwillingness of the Victim to press 
charges 

The Victim said she was assaulted by 
the suspect in an underground garage 
followmg the party. The suspect 
admmcd that he had sex with the 
woman , but claimed she consented to 
the act. 

The Alpha Tau Omega fra ternity was

Institute for Cognitive Science 
receives $25,000 grant 

Thc Digital EqUipment Corpora tion 
re endy donated $25,000 to the Institute 
for Cognmve SCience at UCSD and 
joined the insnrute's new group of 
industrial sponsors, the Affiliates of 
Cognitive Science. 

rCS is a multi -diSci plina ry research 
unit devoted to the study of human 
thought and reasoning processes, the 
mechanisms by which Intelligent, 
cogni tive activities are carried out. 
Cognitive scientists use sophisticated 
computer systems to study how the 
human mmd works - how people 
think, perceive and remember. 

ICS established the affiliates in 
response 10 industry'S growing interest 
m its research . Industry recognized that 
research in cognitive science has 
important implications for application , 
especially in modem intelligent 
computer systems. It anows students and 
faculty to try to apply their Ideas outside 
of the laboratory and allows the 
companies to be at the cutting edge of 
research. 

ICS's major goals are to develop 
computer systems that are more efficient 
and easier to use than today's 
computers and to design parallel 
processing networks that work much 
more like the human brain than the 
conventional computer. 

Digital Equipment, headquartered in 
Maynard , Massachussets, Is the world 's 
largest manufacturer of networked 
computer systems and peripheral 
equipment and a leader in systems

Students protest overeducation budget cuts 
By JAMES P_ PINPIN, Staff Wntcr 

SACRAMENTO - " Duke , 
Duke, don't you know? Your 
budget cuts have got to go!" " ... so 
come on Deukmejian, we demand 
an education!" "The people united 
will never be defeated!" 

These kinds of chants were 
heard this April 6 in Sacramento, 
as students and other concemed 
community members marched 
towards the State Capitol to 
demonstrate their displeasure with 
Gov. George Deukmejian and his 
policies towarcts education . 

The students were spearheaded 
by three major networks of 
minority student organizations -
the Movimiento Estudiantil 
Chicano de Azatlan (MeChA), the 
Mrican/ Black Student Statewide 
Alliance (AI BSSA}, and the 
Asian / Pacific Islander Student 
Union (APSU). 

The concerns addressed by the' 
marchers were Deukmejian's 
educational budget cuts and 
cutbacks in categorical programs 
(K through 12 and the community 
colleges programs), the removal of 
bilingual education , and the 
implementation of new student 
admission requirements for 
California State Ulliversity, an of 
which were directly affecting 
minority students. 

The demonstration, fueled by 
the slogan "Education is a right, 
not a privilege," and ended at the 
front of the State Capitol where 
prominent speakers like Reverend 
Jesse Jackson and State Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown gave their 
support to the crowd of over 5,000. 

"We haven 't seen this many 
people for a long time," said 
Brown. 

"This march was made using 
doughnut dollars. It is through 
organizations that students 
statewide were able to assemble 
like this ," said a student activist. 

Students came from universities 
throughout California. As far south 
as UC San Diego and as far north 
as San Francisco State University, 
which is the communications and 
resource center of the newly 
formed student alliance . 

Speakers of the alliance 
an~ounced that this rany was just 
the beginning of a movement for a 
quality education for all students. 
Especially the minority students, 
whose numbers are growing. 

"The priority (of the budget) 
should be for education. Our task 
is to communicate with the 
governor .. . the legislators ... the 
people of California. Our task is to 
request and if it goes unheeded, 
then to demand," said Mario 
Obleda , who was the past 
president of the League of Latin 
American Citizens. Present figures 
show that the funding for 
education is approximately 1.5 
percent of the state budget. 
Comparatively, military spending 
is approximately 29 percent. 

"We demand that America 
educate its children. It's the key to 
our future . . . education is nor a 
social program, it's a national 
defense act," Jackson said . 

Jackson also addressed the 
racial implications of the Issues 

raised that day. "Today, the s ite of 
the fight is at a state capi tol 
demanding a greater investment in 
education for all of the children," 
Jackson said. He contested the 
English-only initiative , stating that 
the users of English are simply a 
minority, that the majority o f the 
world are non-English speakers 
and that it would be unfair to 
impose the language o f the 
minOrity to the majority. "America 
is nor a blanket (of one color} ... it 

is a quilt ... many sizes ... many 
colors .. . bound by a common 
thread ," Jackson said . 

marchers to come back later thi~ 
April, when he and his colleagues 
will co n fro nt Deukmejian 
concern ing the funds to be used 
for public education. 

Brow n emphasized the 
neceSSity for students to register 
and , more importantly, to vote. He 
stated that the only reason 
Deukmejian was not there asking 
for the crowd 's bleSSing was 
because Deukmejian knew the 
crowd was not capable of hurting 
him due to their lack of political 
partlcipation. Brown invi ted the 

Other speakers of the march 
included Maxine Walters (State 
Assembly member), Art Torres 
(Stare Senator), Mable Teng (Vice-
Chairperson, SF Chinese 
Progressive ASSOciation ), and 
representatives from the three 
student networks. 1m 

Duke responds to 'complainers' 
By j.W. AKERS-SASSAMAN. Capi/ol CorrtSpondfnt 

SACRAMENTO, UC Wire - The pleas of over 
4,000 students who marched on the state capitol 
Monday, April 6, to fight for education have 
apparently fallen on deaf ears. 

Despite students' cans for more money for 
educational efforts, Gov. George Deukmejian's 
response was that the marc hers were 
"complainers" who were not responsive to the 
needs of the entire state. 

After marching in from a park 10 blocks away, 
the protesters held a rally on the steps of the 
capitol where they decried Deukmejian's funding 
cuts in education and restrictive California 
educational opportunities. 

The demonstrator's list of demands includes 
more student input on curriculum and priorities of 
California's colleges and universities; an ethnic 
studies graduation requirement and expanded 
Black, Chicano, Asian and Native American 
studies programs; and strengthened Equal 

Opportunity Programs/ Student Affirmative Action 
programs. 

They also spoke out against funding limitations 
for state colleges, bilingual education programs 
and financial aid and urged the recension of 
planned fee increases at California's public 
universities and colleges. 

Deukmejian , who leaves today for a 13 day trip 
to open the California European Office in London, 
England , expressed his disdain for the rany In a 
prepared statement. He was not available for 
personal comment. 

"The leaders ... of the demonstration need to 
ask themselves 'why is it that the overall state 
budget will increase by 2 percent next year, and ye t 
spendi ng on education will increase 4.5 percent?"' 
he said . 

"The answer is that education is , and will 
continue to be, our top budget priority,"

Same script, different time 
By PETER QUERelA 

nonsense and substance from 
image. 

When Caner was president, he 
held 59 nationally teleVIsed news 
conferences at an average of 14.7 a 
year. Eisenhower held 193 in 96 

months for a 24.1 average; Ford 39 
in 29 months, a 16.1;Johnson 135 
in 62 months, a 26,2; Kennedy 64 
in 34 months, a 22.6; even "Tricky 
Dick," who obsessively despised 
and feared the media and blamed 
them for his subsequent downfall 
held 37 in 67 months, a 6,6, And 
the man for whom the buck 
stopped, and the president to 

whom Reagan is most often 
compared, held 322 nationwide 
press 'conferences during his 93 
months as president for an average 
of 41.5 . Yet it is Reagan , who has 
participated in only 39 in 76 
months in office, (the least amount 
for any president in the last 60 
years) that is widely admired as 
"The Great Communicator." 

The 19805 will hkely be referred 
to in future history books as the 
decade of contradictions. The 
Reagan Administration deserves 
the most credit for this 
accomplishment. Indeed , It has 
consistently in orporated 
contradiction as the centerpiece In 
all its policies and proclamations. 

Its foreign policy, for example, 
consists of no poliCies whatsoever, 
as an astute former president 
Jimmy Caner observed in the April 
3 edition of 'The MacNeil-lehrer 
Newshour". The world can 
personally thank one man -
Ronald Reagan - as the 
charismatic ringmaster of the 
traveling road show that moved 
from Hollywood to wimer In 
WashIngron for the past SIX years 

This is a guy who use to fabricate ' 
entire football games wh de 
employed at Mldwesl radio 
stations in the 1930s. He told 
stones of the atrocities he 
expenenced In World War II -
WIthout leaving Hollywood. He has 
built his career by defrauding the 
public , He has, however. been an 
immensely successful con man 
having nsen from a two-bltactorto 
the leader of the most powerful 
nation on Eanh , 

lHTfHSluTfHSlHTfHSlfTTfHslfTTmslfTTfHSlf 
It has been only recently, With 

the advent of the Iran-Contra 
connection scandal, that thinking 
Amencans are finally awakening to 
the fact thaI they have elected a 
fraud . Someone who IS totally 
unable to distinguish fact from 
lantasy, truth from lies, logic from 

Guardian pseudo-poll 
lacking resources and time, the GuardIan mId-election poll may not 

prove statistically accurate, nevenheless, the results obtamed from the 55 
participants prOVide some interesting information, 

Although there appears to be a fair degree of suppon (42 percem) for 
Dave Marchlck m the preSidential race, 22 percent of those polled either 
refused to name a pamcular candidate or were undecided, Eric Weiss 
received suppon from 18 percent of the participantS, 9 percent were in 
favor of DaVid Fnend, 7 percent backed Byron Morton and 2 percent noted 
Gino Ki ng as the most qualified m dl Vidual for A.5. President. I n order for a 
candidate to be elected mto office he must receIve fifry-one percent of the 
VOle. With thiS in mind, you should not dismiss the importance of voting 
in the election, 

With the exception of Referendum #2 (cable 1V and radIO) and 
Referendum #5 (fundmg Intercollegiate athletics and football ), the 
sentiment among students appeared quite clear cut. Seventy-eight percent 
were opposed to the expendirure ofUCSA srudent fee funds and resources 
on Issues which do not directly affect students as students (Referendum 
#1), The establishment of space available during hours when libraries are 
closed IS supponed by 91 percent of srudents (Referendum #3) , 
Referendum #4, proposmg several AS constitution amendments 
regarding the junsdlctlon of the AS JudiCial board and the fmality of their 
deciSIOns is viewed favorably by 73 percent of respondents. And the co-op 
referendum drew a pOSlllve response from 87 percent of those polled. 

Although Referendum #2 IS supponed by 60 percent of respondents, 
there IS a substantial number of srudents who are opposed [0 [he 
establishment of cable television and radiO on campus. 

Increased fees for intercollegiate athletics and football is supponed by 
59 percent of those polled, but 41 percent opposed the proposal. 
IndiViduals affiita[ed with fraternities and soromies voted "yes," 3 to lover 
those against a fee increase, as compared to a much narrower 5 to 4 margin 
reponed among those not associated with the Greek system. 

These results are actually representative of only a fraction of student 
opinion, therefore, they mayor may not reflect the final election results.

organization favors a hunting 
season and he maintains that spon 
hunting has nor and will not 
endanger any species due to the 
regulatiops which "take into 
account all the elements of the 
ecological balance." 

By JOHN KEARNEY 
Bob Farner's Wildlife Protection 

and Education organization 
displayed a live mountain lion and 
solici ted Signatures at Revelle Plaza 
April 7 to petition the upcomi ng 
State Fish and Game Commission 
hearings which will decide 
whether or not a mountain lion 
hunting season should be 
established in California. 

hunting season has sti rred a lot of 
controversy since spon hunters 
and ranchers claim that the 
mountain lion is dangerous to 
people, livestock, and the 
environment as well . 

Bob Fusco, the preSident of the 
San Diego County Wildlife 
Federation, said in retrospect of 
the recent attacks on people in 
Orange County, "As the numbers of 
mountain lion increase, we will 

Kris Waller, the spokesperson 
for the San Diego Chapter of 
People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals, states rhat the twO recent 
attacks on people were only twO 
OUt of the four in this century and 
that they were probably commirted 
by the same mountain lion. Waller 
claims that lions which arrack 
people are usually either former 
petS who have lost their fear of 
humans or lions that have been 
wounded by hunters and can no 
longer feed upon prey. She also 
says that in a recent poll, only eight 
percent of the farmers reported 
losses due to mountain lions 
whereas 65 percent reported losses 
due to wild and domestic dogs, 

In 1972, the bill AB-467 passed 
through the state legislarure and 
thus declared a moratorium on the 
hunting of mountain lions . 
However, Governor Deukmejian 
vetoed this bill when it was up for 
renewal in 1986, and as a result the 
mountain lion has been 
reclassified as a game ammal As 
such, the mountain lion may soon 
l?e hunted according to the 
upcoming regulations of the State 
Fish and Game Commission, 
whose majority of members are 
Deukrnejian appointees. 

The decision to declare a 

"Sheba" may appear to be a pussy cat, but some members of the 
Game Commission have her in their gun sights. 

On being accused of taking an 
emotional and moralistic 
standpoint, Waller comments that, 
"These people (who want a 
hunting season) do not have a 
basic grasp of ecology, and the f do 
not understand the Importance of 
the lion to our ecosystem." She

believes that a hunting season 
would not be Justified on the 
grounds that there is insuffiCient 
scientific data to suppurta hunting 
season, and she has thus devoted 
much of her time to researching 
the role of the mountam lion in the 
ecosystem. 

One important factor Waller 
adds is rhe Fish and Game 
Commission has overlooked the 
effect of genetic isolation among 
mountain lions, For example , the 
mountain lion population in San 
Diego County is made up of groups 
which exist separately because of 
barriers such as freeways and 
hOUSing developments . This 
presents the problem of in-
breeding since these groups 
remain Isolated from each other 
and by nature will not migrate to 
diversify the gene pooL 

Waller offers scientific srudies 
done in Florida and British 
Columbia where hunting has 
compounded this problem of 
genetic isolation by further 
reducing the already limited gene 
pooL 

Fusco addresses this issue of 
stabilizing the lton populatlon, 
which has been very difficult to 
determine, by saying that 
"mountain hons probably eXist in 
numbers beyond that whIch the 
wildlands can accomodate." He IS 
confident that the Fish and Game 
Commission will afftx appropriate 
regulations to ensure that the 
mountain lton does not become an 
endangered species.

Deukmejian said he believed 
protestor's effons could be better

found it easier to organize a march 
to ask for more money for 
education, then to put their 
energies to work improving our

Education is a financial priority, 
but not the only priority, said the 
republican governor, who in the 
pa st has strongly resisted efforts to 
raise taxes. "We all agree on the 
importance of education to our 
children and to California'S 
future," Deukmejian said. 

"However, our critics favor tax 
increases. We don't. Our critics 
don't have to worry about the 
needs of the elderly, the sick, the 
poor, the disabled, roads, parks,

Deukrnejian did not respond to 
allegations by students and the

Sonny keeps the blood flowing 

By REBECCA JAURIGUE. Staff Wnter 

T HE nearby Family Fimess at choreographed movementS. Sonny University Towne Center thrives on the energy of the people could practically be around him, while his own 
considered another UCSD enthusiasm is infectious as well . 
ExtenSIOn. Students opportunely I 
schedule their workouts as they do C ub members have the option 

of takIng aerobl' cs classes lectures; just as they select UCSD 
professors. they prefer certaIn according to scheduled times and 
Family Fimess instructors Instructors . Quite a few Family 

Fimess members express that they 
IntrodUCing Sonny rangilinan, make it a point to attend Sonny's 

24, a popular aerobICS Instructor at class. 
Family Fimess. 

With upbeat music and stylized 
routines, Sonny's aerobics class is a 
command performance. At times, 
Sonny is like a drill sergeant 
scouting the ranks or a little boy 
teasing for attention. The club 
members in the class remain 
amused as they foll ow hIS 

Sonny has been on the Family 
Fimess staff for the past seven 
months. He is aware that he plays a 
role as entertainer, cheerleader, 
and coach. "I just become a 
different person up there in front 
of the class. 1 want the people I help 
out, the club members, to give me 
100%. I try to gIve at least 150%. 1

can feel their energy toward me, 
and I give it right ba k. I get spoiled 
by that. I love it; it's fun! ." 

As a visible and vocal instructor, 
Sonny draws crowds of about a 60 
to 40 female to male ratio in his 
class. One man taking the class 
said, "Sonny's a very motivating 
instructor. He always leads a great 
workout." A woman who is also 
encouraged by Sonny admitted, 
"Since he is attractive to me, I am 
conscious of how I look. So I reaDy 
try hard to do well in his class." 

Regarding the trend In health 
club memberships, Sonny 
commented, "People are into 
fitr.ess . The attitude is that It'S a 
lifesryle: He feels that working out 
is especially important for 
students. Sonny explained that 
many UCSD students in his class 
teU him that their academic 
workloads often get them down. 
Yet they still make it to Family 
Fimess. "You have to have balance. 
When you have too much stress, 
you go work it off, and you feel 
goocl ." 

Aerobics fans know that the 
confident demeanor and fit 
appearance of an Instructor are 
essential to Inspiring productive 
workouts. Sonny encourages 
members to ask questiOns about 
how to make workouts more 
effective. He scans the class forany 
Incorrect motions which could 
cause injury. 

So nny feels that being 
approachable and caring is simply 
part of his Job. He tends to 
downplay his popularity at family 
Fimess in UTe. Sonny noted that, 
since this pamcular club "is one of 
the tOP aerobics centers in the 
area," high attendance at aerobics 
classes is a given. When not 
leading exercises, Sonny's manner 
IS contemplative, almost reserved, 
different from the outgoing self he 
displays during an aerobics class. 

Sonny has been involved in 
athletics since he ran competitive 
track back in hIgh school. AbOut 
the same time, he joined FamIly 
Funess for the advantageous 
reasons mentioned in their 
advertisements : " excellent 
equIpment and close location." 

Sonny explained how he 
developed his interest in aerobics. 
"Before , I thought aerobics were for 

women... you know, because of 
that male ego, I didn't want to do 
them," he confessed. "I used to just 
lift weightS at Family Fimess, and I 
decided. 'I'll try these aerobics fora 
cardiovascular workout They're 
easy . .. but I went out there and 
they kicked my ass! They were 
tougher than I thought!" 

Describing his work, Sonny 
explained, "No matter how goocl 

motivate. help." 
Sonny must be doing something 

right. Recently promoted to the 
position of aerobics coordinator 
for the UTC club, he is now in 
charge of training new instructors 
as well as supervising current staff. 
Sonny also directS local aerobics 
demonstrations for Family Fitness 
every few weeks at places like the 
Marriott Hotel and ordstrom 
Department Store. 

"Before, I thought aerobics were for 
women ... because of that male ego, I didn't 
want to do them. , . but I went out there and 
they kicked my ass!" 

your routine is and no matter how 
good your music is, it does help, 
but it's your personality I that 
makes it workl . You have lO know 
how to communicate with the 
people. You're there to teach, 

- Sonny Pangilinan 

Sonny offered a final word of 
advice that does not cost a Family 
Fimess membership: 'JUSt don't be 
toO hard on yourself. Enjoy life ... 
you only live once, so go for the 
best." 1m

rhe UCSD baseball team this year. 
The Aztec game is always a big 
event for Triton baseball, but this 
year's game was the biggest of all. 
ThIS was the first time the Tritons 
had ever beaten San Diego State. 

Rick Nowak (40) celebrates with teammates 

And what makes the occurence 
even more dramatic IS the fa(.t that 
UCSD has seven seniors, with this 
year's game being absolutely their 
last chance. So when the game was 
over, Coach Lyle Yates and his 
team were a little relieved and 
extremely excited. 

Freshman Kyle Abbott picked 
up the win for the Tritons with 
some help from first time reliever 
Rick Nowak. Together they allowed 
the Aztecs only seven hits. 

Two outstanding plays by 
rightfielder Henry Jimenez need to 
be mentioned. In the sixth inning, 

, 

Jimenez cut ofT a shot down the 
line and held the Aztec player to a

down the line can cause ifitgoesto

JImenez struck again in the 
eIghth on a drive into the gap in 
right-centerfield . If the ball had 
gotten through, It would have 
meant at least a double and a 
runner in scoring position . 
Jimenez saved the Tritons from a 
tough predicament by drifting over 
and diving to grab the ball on the 
fly, which left State with nothing.

Weishan leads golf team 
UCSD on course 
for Nationals 
By MARK PRESSMAN. Staff Wnter 

If the recently held UCI 
Invitational is any Indication, the 
Triton golf team is on its way to the 
Nationals In impreSSive form. 

This InvitatIOnal is held on "one 
of the most diffIcult courses In 
Southern Cahfornia," according to 
head coach MIchael Wydra. The 
tournament ended In a three-way 
tie among the indiVIdual golfers. 
Jim Johnson ofPepperdine, Wayne 
Tyni of orthridge. and Pat 
Weishan of UCSD all shot a 151 to 
force the elimination holes. On (he 
third extra hole, Johnson finally 
pulled out the viCtory against 
Weishan , who consequently 
placed second overall for UCSD. 

Also golfing well for the Tritons 
is Joost Steenkamer, who shot the 
overall low round of 73 at the UCI 
Invitational. 

At the conclusion of the season, 
selected golf teams play in the 
Nationals, the annual playoff 
competition. TIllS year it will be 
held in Ohio. "We're shoe-ins to be 
selected to go back to the 
Nationals; we're better this year 

than we were even last year," said 
Wydra. UCSD's golf tcam , 
incldentaDy, has finished second 
in the nation the last two years. 

As to UCSD's qualifying players 
for the Nationals, the Tritons will 
send the maximum of five out of 
the six players from their squad. 
Pat Weishan will anchor the 
number one spot, followed by Joost 
Steenkamcr, playing number two. 
Although there seems to be some 
inconsistency in the numbers 
three , four and five SpotS, coach 
Wydra has confidence in the third 
and fourth positions which will be 
filled by Brad Sterling and Dean 
Catalano, respectively. Both have 
had enormous tournamentS so far 
this season. The fifth spot, 
however, is still up for grabs. 

There are both team and 
individual competitions at the 
Nationals. "UCSD has a couple of 
silver trophies, and we'd really like 
the gold: said the coach. But 
standing ominously on the 
horizon is the always favored Cal 
State S'anislaus ream. ~ .

The ninth David Mark Belkin Lecture at UCSD will 
take place tonight, April 9. The featured lecturer is Lee 
Stetson, who will present II An Evening with John Muir-
A Conversation With a Tramp." Stetson, who did 
extensive research on John Muir, is also the author of 
"Conversation with a Tramp." 

This one-man show is set in California (circa) 1913. 
Stetson will portray Muir, infamous naturalist, as he waits 
for the results of the legislation concerning the creation of 
a new reservoir. The reservoir would destroy a mountain 
valley; this was an important issue for Muir, who worked 
to preserve the national park system. 

The lecture performance will be held at 8 pm in 
Mandeville Auditorium. Admission is free, and the public 
is encouraged to attend.

Lifelike sculpture 
by eva wong 

In '1974, the tombs of 
China's first emperor, 
containing terra cotta 
soldiers, were found and 
excavated in Xi'an. These 
pieces of sculpture, number~ 
ing in the thousands, were Iife-
sized and true-to-Iife 
representations of a past 

civilization; each extraordin-
ary because no two shared the 
same stance or expression. 

As the terra cotta soldiers 
reflect a period in history, so 
too (on a smaller scale, of 
course) do the works of T.}. 
Dixon. Dixon's work, which 
is on display at the Grove 

UCSD Unversity Events Office presents 

Gallery until April 11, is 
arresting. The ten pieces 
showcased in the Gallery's 
window-enclosed exhibition 
room, grab . the viewers' 
attention and pulls them in for 
a closer look; as une waits in 
line for coffee at the Grove 
Cafe!. 

Dixon's pieces, like the 
terra cotta soldiers, are large~ 
scaled, and seem representa-
tive of the society we live in.

Raising laughs 
by phil macgovem 

Lots of movies have been 
made about stupid hicks and 
the wild and crazy misadven-
tures that they may have. 
Sure, they all may have 
different stories, but they all 
have essentially the same 
theme, which is: Let's all laugh 
at the stupid idiots, aren't you 

glad we're not like that. 
"Raising Arizona" is another 
movie of this genre . 
Unfortunately, most of these 
movies tend to be outrageous-
ly funny (maybe because we 
are glad we are not like that), 
and It Raising Arizona" does

Understand that San Diego 

is known for many wonderful 
things, but not for producing 
great bands. Granted Ratt was 

born in La Jolla, but they did 
not stay to seek their fortune. 

The local music scene does 
not generate the kind of 
response needed to enable its 
musicians to make it big 
without having to move to 
places like L.A. But many of 
these self-proclaimed world 
foresakers would like to see 
some kind of positive 
feedback before making the 
road trip. They will tell you

The scene in San Diego is so 
small, however, that it leads 
one to wonder if these bands 
are musically well-deserved 
ones, and was it some sort of 
spotlighted innovation that 
got them there? 

The reason why San Diego

according to some people, is 
because this town is relatively

of eccentricity - the self-

musicians choose to take, 
versus the more mundane. 

Bernard Yin of The Panic

San Diego's conservatism 
lends itself to people haVing 
preconceived notions of what 
constitutes good music, 
obviously a condition not 

conducive to progressive

says, "Categories must be

It makes you wonder."

Not jacuzzi jazz John Scofield. Scofield is probably best known for his stint with the 
Miles Davis Band (83-85) that 
produced three albums on 
which Scofield's influence is 
considerable. His fiery solos 
and writing contributions ar~ 
key elements in Miles' 
albums, "Star People," 
"Decoy," and "You're Under 
Arrest." Yet more individual 
projects tugged at Scofield's 
heart.

The tM> guitarists who will 

perform in Mandeville 
Auditorium this coming 
Monday night are from a 
realm probably less familiar to 
a college listening audience -
the realm of jazz. 

Michael Hedges and the 
John Scofield Band will be 
splitting!l bill that promises to 
send aspiring fret-monsters to 
the practice room and 
listeners to the record bins. 
Both of these guys have 
complete command of their 

instruments, pure and simple. 
But add a high level of musical 
creativity to ferocious 
technique, and you've got the 
makings of a night not to be 
missed. 

Since Michael Hedges, 
coming from the widely 
acclaimed Windham Hill 
label and "New Age" style, is 
a more familiar name to most 
listeners, I'd like to focus on 
the work of the jazz world's #1 
guitarist - according to Down 
Beat magazine 's Critics' Poll -

WITH THIS AD 

The results of Scofield's 
renewed independence and 
leadership can be heard on

tour. This is Scofield's finest 
M'll'k to date as a leader. What 
makes this latest work most 
impressive is the feeling that 
the group knows each other's 
playing inside and out. A 
drummer and bass player 
could not possibly be more 
telepathic. They simply 
groove, and the live, in-sturuo 
recording captures their 
exchange beautifully. Luckily 
for concertgoers, the same 
players used for the album are 
performing in Scofield's 
touring band, with the 
exception of the keyboard 
player. 

This is not jacuzzi-jazz to be 
relegated to a background role 
as the wine is poured and the 

cheese is sliced. This is music 
to be listened to and thought 
about. Scofield observed, 
"There are people making 
records to sell them, and 
maybe they'll sell a lot of 
records, but I've always 
thought of jazz music as a kind 
of personal expression . 
There will always be a sort of 
easy listening music, and I 
don't reai}.y think it's rdated 
to jazz." 
Don't miss Hedges and 
Scofield, two masters at work, 
this Monday night. Tickets 
are $a for students, $12 for 
faculty and staff and $15 for 
General Admission and 
available at Ticketmaster

Unlike the soldiers, these

not diverse enough in its 
music preferences to hearten 
the variation of the local 
scene. 

The argument sprouts 
inquiries as to whether being 
on the "cutting edge," is really 
worth it for a band whose 
main objective is to someday 
pack stadiums. Therein lies 
the compromise; if a band has 
a familiar sound, promoters 
will bring in the audience. 

of the most committed bands 
in terms of dedication to the 
music realm. Do you think it 
inane that top-40 bands play 
songs by musicians who have 
struggled for years? 

San Diego is in no positon 
to pad the bands who need 
them the most. So they move 
elsewhere to more elaborate 
scenes, more vying and rnore

Superficial groups are 
getting things much easier, 
substantially more than some 

challenging. "If the band's not 
sure that what it has to offer is 
necessarily new, it will get 
squashed in L.A.," Yin says. 
But musicians will also say 
there is no formula and that 
different local bands make it 
in difterent ways. As one 
musician says, " ... we want to 
have fun, and that is the 
toughest way to go."
