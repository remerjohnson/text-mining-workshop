Braille Institute Opens Doors 
To New Location in La Jolla 
SERVICES: Organization provides 
assistance and counseling to the blind 
and partially blind in San Diego 
By J .. tlne sw. 
Guardian Reporter 

Last week, the Braille Institute of San Diego 
opened the doors of its new location to blind stu-
dents from the San Diego County area. 
Donations totaling $7 million funded the con-
struction of the new location, which is approxi-
mately a mile from the UCSD campus. 

The institute. which provides a number of ser-
vices to assist blind and legally blind people in 
learning life skills. will serve hundreds of visual-
ly impaired persons. 

"I\'s truly the best kept secret, but we don't 
want it to be." Jay Hatfield. assistant regional 

director of the San Diego Institute. said. 
With the development of the new location, the 

Braille Institute now has a much larger facility. 
At 28.000 square feet. the new building is four 
times the size of its old location and has many 
modem features. 

Currently, there are 25 staff members, and the 
institute will hire 35 more. 

Nearly 30 students take classes offered at the 
educational center daily. Students range in age 
from 19- to 98-years-old. The classes vary from 
basic life-skill practices to theater, art. dance. 
karate. cooking and yoga. Class size is kept small 
to ensure personal attention. The institute's ser-
vices are free to San Diego County residents. 

Jean Shiave. one of the institute's elderly stu-
dents. signed up for classes in Braille and life-
skills management. She said she was extremely

A.S. Campaign 
Season Begins 
AtUCSD 
ELECTIONS: Voters will go to 
the polls to decide on three 
referenda, choose representatives 
By Vincent Gragnanl 
Senior Staff Writer 

This week marked the official beginning 
of campaigning for A.S. Council offices. 
During the A.S. Council elections. which 
will be held during second week of next 
quarter, students will vote on three referen· 
da and elect the A.S. president, vice presi-
dent. commissioners and senators for t~e 
five college councils. 

Two slates will be represented on the bal· 
lot : Change and Students First! 

Running for the position of A.S. presi-
dent is Change candidate Tesh Khullar. and 
Students First! candidate and current A.S. 
Vice President Finance Pat Ru. 

Warren College Student Council 
President Stephanie Lertzman announced 
her candidacy for AS. president Tuesday at 
noon in the Price Center. Lertzman is an 
independent candidate running with the help 
of 2000 Ways, a registered student organiza-
tion at UCSD. 

Also running for the office of A.S. presi-
dent is independent candidate Sarah 
"Stephanie" Threlfall. 

Candidates are already debating the qual-
ifications and goals of their respective 
slates. 

Ru said that Students First! is a slate 
based on knowledge and experience at 
UCSD. 

"Our slate is extremely involved on cam· 
pus and more than half of us have AS. 
[Council] experience." Ru said. "We already 
have an agenda ready." 

Current A.S. Commissioner of Academic 
Affairs and Change candidate for Vice 
President Internal Doc Khaleghi said that 
his slate it is different because its candidates 
are runn i.~g unly fonhe four executive posi-
tions on A.S. Council. 

"I don't think of it as a slate." Khaleghi 
said. "I think of it as four individuals who 
came together. Our goal was to have the 
most qualified people in every office." 

Lenzman said she is running on a plat-
form of "2000 Ways," attempting to lead 
UCSD into the 21st century with respect to 
academic relations, student life and com-
muter enjoyment. 

"The next AS. president is going to have 
a big chance to innuence the school," 
Lertzman said. "This is really a turning 
point at UCSD. 

Also running for Vice President Internal 
is Jennifer Lee, who is a member of the 
Students First! slate. 

Vice President External candidates are 
current Marshall sophomore senator

Researchers Discover Fault Line 
GEOLOGY: Harvard researcher, UCSD professor found a new fault line beneath 
downtown Los Angeles that could cause very destructive earthquakes 
By Valerie De Charette 
Harvard Crimson (Harvard U.) 

CAMBRIDGE. Mass. - A 
giant fault hidden beneath down-
town Los Angeles could cause 
highly destructive earthquakes, 
according to a recent discovery by 
one Harvard researcher and a col-
league from California. 

Assistant Professor of Structural 
and Economic Geology John H. 
Shaw and Peter Shearer. a profes-
sor at the University of California. 
San Diego, published their lindings 
about the fault in Friday's issue of 
Science magazine. 

VOTE: Students 
will vote on Academic 
Success Program fee 

senator Terrence Patterson of 
Change. 

Matt Powell of the Change slate 
will be running for Vice President 
Finance. as will as current A.S. 
Director of Development Eric 
Rovner of Students First! and inde-
pendent candidate Adam Lara. 

Students will also elect live 
commissioners and four senalors 
from their college. 

In addition to council candi-
dates. students will also be able to 
vote for three referenda. 

The fault, which is composed,of 
three segments. is about 25 miles in 
the east-west direction and 10 
miles in the north-south direction, 
Shaw said. 

Each of the segments is compa-
rable in size to an adjacent fault in 
Northridge. Calif. that caused a 
major earthquake in 1994. he said. 

Shaw said if anyone of the three 
segments does cause an earth-
quake. il could be as destructive as 
the Northridge earthquake -
which had a magnitude of 6.7. 
killed 33 people and caused $35 
billion in damages, stated an article 

The first referendum is a $25 
per quarter increase of the student 
centers fee to pay for the proposed 
expansion of the Price Center and 
the Student Center. In order for this 
referendum to pass. a simple 
majority of voters must approve the 
increase. Graduate and undergradu-
ate students will vote on the issue. 
If the measure passes, the fees will 
not be collected until after the 
expansion is completed. 

If passed. the second referen-
dum would result in a $1 quarterly 
fee that would fund the Academic 
Success Program (A.S.P.). A.S.P. 
offers programs such as book lend-
ing. peer mentoring and tutoring. 
This fee referendum requires a 25 
percent voter turnout and the 
approval of a simple majority of 
voters. 

in The Nell' 'ri/rk Times on Mar. 5. 
If all three segments were to 

rupture simultaneously, an earth-
quake about three times as violent 
as the Northridge disaster could 
occur, Shaw said. 

Researchers already suspected 
the fault's existem;e. but it was not 
confirmed until oil companies 
drilling in the Los Angeles basin 
provided evidence. he said. 

It is not known when the fault 
might cause an earthquake, Shaw 
said. Scientists still need to lind out 
when the stress began and whether it 
has been relieved by a past temblor. 

The third referendum, submitted 
by A.S. President Joe Leventhal, 
asks students if they support 
extending spring break from one 
wcek to two weeks. 

The extension of spring break 
would extend spring quarter one 
additional week into June. 
Leventhal said the measure is non-
binding and is only meant to mea-
sure student opinion. 

"If there is going to be any 
move to change the academic 
schedule, the first step would be to 
get an accurate pulse of the cam-
pus," Leventhal said. 

He added Ihat the extension of 
spring break was discussed lasl 
year during election time. 

"A two-week spring break was 
an issue that Students First! ran on 
last year," Leventhal said. ''They

Triton Athletics Thrive, 
Await Move to Division II 

It seems like we are always comparing UCSD to 
Division I athletics. Students. faculty and sports fans 
alike yearn for an atmosphere at UCSD that promotes 
sports and the joy that high-caliber games bring to a 
campus. People have not gone to UCSD sporting 
events in the past because the Tritons played unmem-
orable schools such as Muskigum and Montclair 
State. 

In preceding years, UCSD has moved up and 
become recognized as an outstanding academic and 
research-oriented institution. Perhaps in a few years 
this campus wi II also be nationally known for its ath-
letic prowess . We are creating good people on this 
campus. The expan~iol1 of our athletic program will 
only bring beller. brighter and more diverse students 
to UCSD. 

But before we jump to the year 2000, when UCSD 
athletics will compete at the Division II level , we 
must recognize the superior Division III program we 
have right now. We are the defending Division III 
Sears Directors' Cup Champions and have always 
housed a strong program. During this winter, the 
Tritons have continued to be strong - just as they 
did in the fall and all of last year. 

The men 's ba~ketball team had one of its most 
memorable seasons ever. Head Coach Greg 
Lantheir's squad jumped out to it 's best start in 
UCSD history and finished a strong 20-5. Assistant 
men 's basketball coach Dave Dillon added to the 
splendor. Dillon vowed to sleep atop RIMAC Arena 
until the attendance record was set. This. coupled 
with the A.S. Council's initiation ot Triton Tide -
a campuswide spirit group that serves to promote 
UCSD athletics - created one of the greatest 
moments in UCSD athletic history: Spirit Night -
one raucous game with 3,713 students in atten-
dance. the most ever to attend a UCSD athletic 
event. 

The women 's basketball team also turned in 
another splendid season. The Tritons went 19-6 on 
the year. winning 12 of their tinal 13 games. 

Mid-quarter, numerous other squads opened up 
their season. including baseball, tennis. track, soft-
ball. water polo and golf. The Tritons are in stride. 
The women's tennis team is 6-0. the men's track team 
is 10-0. and the golf team just won the 49th Annual 
SOllthern California Intercollegiate Golf 
Championship at Torrey Pines. 

So life for the Tritons and Triton fans alike was 
good this quarter and it promises to be equally good 
in the spring. And if it is this good now, imagine what 
Division II will be like when we start playing schools 
everyone has heard of!

THREADS OF ATHLETIC FABRIC 
TORN BY FIERCE COMPETITION 

COMMENTARY: 
Result-based competition 
endangers all other fonns 
of social interaction 
By Simone Santini 
Senior Staff Writer 

By a peculiarly whimsical twist of 
fate, I was trapped in an utterly uncom-
fortable seat aboard Continental night 
1245 reading Umberto Eco's "Travels 
in Hyperreality" - the chapter in 
which Eco indulges in denigrating sport 
- just as the captain announced the 
linal result of some football match. 
During the NFL season, this announce-
ment was hardly surprising. 

The mystique attached to sports is 
undeniable. It would otherwise be hard 
to explain why 84 percent of UCSD 
students decided to VOle for Division II 
athletics (a decision that apparently 
will have no bearing on the quality of 
their education), and why the notori-
ously stingy (sorry, fiscally wnserva-
tive) San Diegans blissfully agreed to 
fund an extravagant stadium down-
town without so much as a gilsp. 

We obviously assign sports a cathar-
tic value, and we let the professionill 
athletes ascend to a stilt liS of idolization 
unbestowed on anybody since the 
saints in the Middle Ages. It is not easy 
to determine why ~u.:h a ciltharsis 
should be ,u.:cesscd through sports. It is 
equillly diflicult to understilnd why a 
wuple dOlen muscular guys chasing an 
intlated flask is more worthy of our 
attention than, say, listening to a sym-
phony or going to the theater. 

Why are we so fascinated by the 
spectacle of sheer self-motivating phys-
ical exercise, otherwi~c known as 
sports'! It may be the slightly fascist 
enchantment with physical eOiciency 
- the same cult trndition;IlIy associat-
ed wilh the !!Cnseless sacrifice of young

popular in countries like Denmark as 
they are in the United States. 

We ~hould start with some clarifica-
tion. When we talk about sport, we 
mean two very distinct things: practic-
ing sport or walching sport (i .e. practic-
ing sport vicariously). The first one is a 
reasonably respectable activity. When 
practiced non-professionally. and with 
hoth eyes on the actual activity rather 
than on the competition, it is useful for 
working out the biceps and other social 
muscles. Practicing social spons (as 
opposed to running the mile alone), 
especially in the unregulated manner 

kids do, can help to set up a network of 
interrelations and social conventions. 
There isn't much to say against that. 

Practicing competitive sports is a 
different matter altogether. Although it 
is justified socially hy a generalized 
idea of competition (having single win-
ners, spelling bees and bumper stickers 
proclaiming that one's child was an 
honor student at such-and-such middle 
school), I regard the practice of ludic 
competition as detestable. Rather, 
competition is a natural outcome of the 
playfulness of certain activities, and as 
such, it is induced and reinforced by 
the system of mutual relations estab-
lished in the act. Only when we have 
precise rules can we find out "who is 
the best," and having a stake in the 
game, with nobody wanting to lose, we 
are forced to make the rules more pre-
cise and encompassing. 

What is unsettling is the institution-
alization of competition as the only 
essential thread in the fabric of play 
and, by generalization, of society. This 
leaves behind all other modes of social 
interaction that characterize us as 
humans, such as pity, empathy and 
collaboration. Institutionalization of 
competitive sport at a young age (as 
well as spelling bees and the bumper 
sticker) is no small part. 

&0 observes that a spectator viewing 
a sport is much like a voyeur spying on 
sexual intercourse. The orgiastic, almost 
orga~mic demeanor of the sports fan 
during his favorite football game is no 
different from that of the crowd that 
incited the rape in the film "The 
Accused." The same concept of the sub-
limation of the act by interposed people 
applies. 

The argument is a bit simplistic, but 
smgularly convincing. Spectators subli-
mate &he myth of phYSIcal strenglh and 
victory in battle. Victory in battle canies

HOLOCAUST'S PLACE IN HISTORY UNDENIABLE 
Editor: 

In your editorial un MondilY 
("Choose Legitimatcly." March I l. 
you wrote. "Whereas most people 
would disagree with anyone saying 
the Holocaust nevcr occurred, this 
insert reflects the views of a large 
percentage of our population." 
Anyone saying the Holocaust never 
occurred is lying and wrong. It is 
not an opinion to be disagreed with, 
it is a lie to be repudiated. The 
Holocaust is a matter of historical 
record; the Nazis systematically 
murdered millions of Jews and mil-
lions of other people as part of a 
horrible plan. It is absurd to imply 
that a revisionist claiming it never 
happened could be righl. I hope 
that was not the intention of the 
editors. and that they will make 
their position clear.

SocIal Security Is 
11",,1 In Most Stat. 
Editor: 

I feel that neither of the two 
articles ("The NEW New Deal") 
concerning Social Security that ran 
in the Feb. 22 edition of the 
Gllardiall properly addressed the 
issue. Social Security IS a blatantly 
illegal federal program and there-
tore should he ended immediately. 

r----------, 

As it is currently run. Social 
Security is a pyramid scam. These 
scams involve paying current debts 
with current revenues, which 
makes them unstable in the long 
run. Such scams are illegal under 
the laws of most states. The federal 
government should not be permit-
ted to violate sueh laws. 

Why not just reform Social 
Security? Under the 10th 
Amendment, the federal govern-
ment is not permitted to operate a 
mandatory national retirement pm-
gram. Social Security. in any form. 
would still be such a program. 
Therefore. Social SecurilY violates 
the Constitution and must be imme-
diately and permanently shut down. 

What about the elderly? Would 
such an action make them homeless. 
wandering the streets for food ') No. 
The vast majority of retired people 
have working children who would 
be able to support them. Since these 
workers are the ones paying for 
Social Security in the first place, the 
only thing that would change is the 
elimination of the middleman. 

What about those retired people 
who have no children? They have 
extended families who could sup-
port them. Only a very callous per-
son would refuse to provide food 
and shelter to a needy parent or 
uncle.

Ev.y Viewpoint 
Must Be Tolerated 
Editor: 

In his article "A Clouded 
Rainbow of Tolerance" (March I), 

Robert O'leary contradicts himself. 
In the lirst part of the article, he 

praises some episodes of 
"Dawson's Creek" in which a high 
school student's coming out as 
homosc)(ual is received with toler-
ance. acceptance and support. by a 
male peer. his girlfriend and a 
Catholic woman. At the end of his 
article, in support of these episodes 
of "Dawson's Creek," O'Leary 
writes, ..... we mustn't forget the 
importance of tolerance." 

In the second part of his art ide, 
he himself forgets it. He condemns 
people on a CNN television show 
for advocating "Homose)(ual 
Content" warning labels for televi-
sion programs. He cites a person 
who advocated these warning 
labels so that he could screen the 
homosc)(ual content to which his 
children was e)(posed. Not only 
does O' Leary argue that the con-
cern for one's own children is 
merely a cover for hatred (" ... 
'hate,' when haphazardly wrapped 
in a guise like the concern and love 
for children, .. . "), but argues that 
such a viewpoint should not even 
be tolerated. writing, "A response 
to this continued exercise in hate 
and bigotry must be made to say 
that such an evil will not be tolerat-
ed by the people of this world." 

Before getting to O' Leary 's 

contradicting himself. the first 
thing we have 10 question is 
whether the concern for one's chil-
dren here stated is really a cover for 
hatred of homosexuals, as the rea-
son for the advocating of 
"Homosexual Content" warning 
labels. In support of this. O'Leary 
argues that there is no reason for 
these warnings since homosexuali-
ty is not dangerous. merely differ-
ent. "There is no need 'for a warn-
ing label on something that is dif-
ferent, just something that is dan-
gerous." But couldn't these parents 
be, likc I myself would be. justifi-
ably concerned with the effects of 
seeing homosexual content, 
inevitably depicted in some elusive 
light, on their own -children? 

Even if he wants to resist that 
there is any justification for this 
concern. with which I would dis-
agree with him. shouldn't these 
parents have the right to decide for 
themselves what is dangerous and 
what isn't and thus what they want 
their children to see in their own 
homes, on their own televisions'! 
Besides, for his questionable attri-
bution of hatred to these parents, 
O' Leary nat-ollt contradicts him-
self when he argues that such a 
response should not be tolerated hy 
the people of this world. Didn 't he

ture that rewards winning at all 
costs. Deeds like a great champion 
lending one of his bicycle tires to

lous in today 's sports.

.!HI ALL DAY FRIIIJAlr5-L_-..... 

The utilization of sports for the 
sublimation of certain violent 
instincts might also be responsible 
for the singular attachment to the out-
come of a game and of the omniprc,-
ence of an clement of violence. or, at 
least. of direct unmediated antago-
nism, in the most popular sports. In 
cxtreme cases this has been known to 
degeneratc into murder in some Latin 

Possibly connected to the same 
motifs is the progressive dehuman-
il.ation of industrial sport . 
Connected to this dehumanilation 
is the increased emphasis that is 
placed on the results, rather than on 
the final stage of a more articulated 
event. I am referring in particular to 
the decline of sportsmanship and 
non-professional athleticism. The 
idea that loyalty to the spirit of an 
athletic endeavor should take 
precedence over the imperative to 
win has already disappeared from 
high level sport practice. 

Initially, this idea was pushed 
away by the economic pressure of 
the companies that paid lor the 
sport, but now it is being pushed 

By the same token, we are ready 
to endorse and appreciate medical 

proccdurc.~ whose ultimate projec-
tion can only be the creation of ath-
lete-machines. I can't see how to stop 
short of sending robots to compete in 
the place of athletes, thereby closing 
the cirele and going back to a com-
pletely ludic activity, restricted. this 
time, to betting and entertainment. SUBS • SALADS • APpnllERS

Generall Store Co-op 
Supports Addiction 
Editor: 

I just finished waiting in line at 
the General Store Co-op. The damn 
line went way hack to the hackpack 
~ection. ~o I had some time to 
notice a trend. UCSD Students are 
huying cigarettes like crazy. A~ I 
left the Co-op and headed past The 
Hump. I saw cigarette butts all over 
the place. Bitchin ', dude! 

The General Store Co-op man-
agers are displaying their ciggies so 
prominently at the counter, the out-
door advertisillg next to the film-
drop is superfluous. The whole 
cashier stand looks like a cigarette 
ad! Our own little Triton Tobacco 
Stand. Isn't that rad '! 

Now the Co-op Managers can 
identify with the tohacco industry 's 
,upremc position as a vendor of the 
world 's mo,t addictive legal drug. 
I' m cel1ain they add up the register 
tape cach night and nwrvel at the 
dollars made from their cigarette 
sale,. Much like a ~ Ill oker. 'the Co-

hide behind rationales like. "Hcy,

dom of choice" argument. 

That's all neato and everything. 
hut fas i-forward ,\ bit into thc 
future : Johnny i, sti ll wheeli ng

big chunk of his tongue and Tina 
Triton has stopped stressing 
because she's dead. Did any of 
these hypothetical UCSD students 
really know what they were in for? 

Pretty sad UCSD. Of all the 
wonderful drugs out there. the 
lamcst of all seems to be winning 
the hearts and lungs of UCSD -
not to mention fattening the wallets 
of to hac co mogUls. And stinking up 
campus walkways. And littering 
campus wtth cigarette hUll S. 

It 's hard to imagine which rea-
son for lighting up UCSD smokers 
are buying into. Surely it can't be 
rehellion. No way is it the illusion 
of maturity, sexiness or intellectu-
alism. Don' t tell me cigarettes arc · 
the answer for the stressed-out life 
of a UCSD student? What a joke! 
You want stress? Try telling your 
loved ones that you've just been 
diagnosed with an inoperable, can-
cerous tumor in your throat. So not 
rad. 

Let's try to be constructive here. 
Why don 't the smokers of UCSD 
and their suppliers, the General Store 
Co-op. agree to help clean up alier 
themselves? Fonn a little smokers' 
grounds crew. Put on those orange 
work vests twice a week, gmb some 
of those pick-up sticks and take 
some responsibility lor their addic-
tion. Clean up the mess! 

In retum, the rest of us will toler-
ate as always. We' ll continue sharing 
the hurden of outrageous hospital 
bills \Americans shell out close to 
$30 billion each year to care for sick 
and dying smokers\. We'll inhale the 
residue of smokers' problems when-
ever we're downwind. and. when 
possihle we'lI kccp acting as if the 
smoke doesn't bother us in the 
slightest. All we ask of UCSD's 
newest erop of smokers is for some 
responsibility and courtesy.

Criticism Mlsu ... 
Triton Tide as a Tool 
Editor: 

I wanted to comment on your 
two editorials from the March 4 
edition of the Guardian. If you 
look at the editorial (,'AS. Council 
Demonstrates Concern for Student 
Needs") on page four, it reads 
"Moreover, the A.S. Council creat-
ed the Triton Tide to boost school 
spirit by encouraging attendance at 
athletic events and even giving out 
free T-shirts. These efforts turned 
out to be a big success." Then the 
column by Shannon Castle 
("Conquering the War on Apathy") 
on page five reads, ·'Unfortunately. 
except for a few Triton Tide T-
shirts wandering around campus. 
this campaign has produced few 
results." How could there be such 
blatant contradiction on the same 
page of the GI/ardian'! 

Castle. the next time you want 
to make your point of view in the 
Guardian. I would appreciate it if 
you didn't usc the Triton Tide as 
your tool. Before you publicly crit-
icize the organization you should 
have a better frame of reference 
and know something about the 
organization you are talking about.

their cars around. 

My father worked for Arco in its 
Alaska division; the company does 
as lillie haml to the environment as 
it reasonably can when e)ltracting 
oil from the North Slope. Of course 
conditions will not remain pristine, 
but that's the price we pay for our 
liberal energy consumption. I had 
hoped CalPIRG would promote 
sensible alternatives to oil consump-
tion, but it seems to be just another 
misguided reactionary organization.

President Clinton I. 
An ImmOral La ...... 

. Editor: 
In his article, "President Clinton 

Saves the Day as Modern 
Superhero" (March 4), Ward Han 
made haste in inappropriately and 
inaccurately portraying those who 
question Clinton's authority as 
"despicable villains." 

While he docs in fact continue to 
make scveml unfounded claims in 
his article, the core flaw in his praise 
of Clinton is one that many 
Americans should be ashamed of. 
Admittedly, there may not be sum-

cient evidence to prove any criminal 
onenses commilled by Clinton in 
Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater or 
in tbe most recent Monica Lewinsky 
scandal. However, a.~ Clinton him-
self has confessed. he cheated on his 
wife in a sustained and completely 
inappropriate aflair. then lied sever-
al times to cover it up. 

No one can argue against the 
fact that the president of the United 
States serves not only as the chief 
e)lecutive ollicer of our nation, but 
also as a prominent role model. 
Because of his proven infidelity 
and dishonesty, our president has 
compromised his core role as a 
model citizen. 

As demonstrated by Han's 
relentless applause of Clinton, 
many people refuse to acknowledge 
the severity of these moral crimes. I 
sincerely hope that those who share 
Han's surprisingly misled percep-
tion of morality will someday see 
why our president should not be so 
unwaveringly supported.

a sarcastic representation of the 
Clinton events and was not meant 
to be taken seriously. 

1M's Provide Relief 
To the Sir_eel 
Editor: 

After six years of skimming, 
through the Gllardian's sports 
opinion articles on the freakin' 
Chargers or Bay Area baseball, I 
was pleasantly surprised when I 
read a couple of the more recent 
articles, namely Coach's take on 
hockey, and more particularly, lake 
Gordon's plug for 1M's. 

Thursday, March II, 1999 

While UCSD's academic repu-
tation has increao;ed these past few 
years, I've also noticed an unfortu-
nate sense of apathy in terms of 
participating in extracurricular 
activities by many students. As a 
former SA in the 1M department, I 
am of course partially biased. 
Nevertheless, I am in full agree-
ment with Coach when he states 
that "everyone should get drunk 
and play 1M's." 

1M's provide a great outlet to 
relieve stress, get some e)lercise 
and meet tons of new people. 
Unfortunately, some of the smaller 
sports like noor hockey, inner tube 
water polo and Hawaiian football 
are struggling to stay anoat. The 
hockey program, for eumple, 
dwindled down from 70+ teams to 
a meager 24 in only si)l years. My 
point is that 1M's provide a cheap 
and easy outlet to have fun with a 
minimal time commitment. Even if 
you've never played a particular 
sport, I guarantee you'll still have a 
great time. EVERYONE can sacri-
fice an hour or two a week to play 
1M sports and still get into graduate 
school or find a good job. 

It's not just 1M's. The UCSD 
Recreation Department is also one 
of the best in the country. From 
renting crampons at Outback 
Adventures to learning how to 
salsa in a Latin dance class, the 
opportunities are endless. You can 
even learn the "clean and jerk" or 
"snatch" techniques in an Olympic 
Weightlifting course. 

As a sixth year super-duper 
senior, I can honestly tell you that 
once you leave campus, you'll 
never have the same opportunities 
again ... so take advantage of them!

"The be~t thing about the insti -

Fonseca said. 

The audio books arc partially

Hatfield also said that the insti-

p(lrtive environment for students to 
share their laughter, tears and frus-
Irations. He said that he believes 
teachers learn just as much from 
their students as their students 
learn from them. 

"There is a real sense of cama-
raderie," Hatfield said. 

In addition, Hatfield said that 
the institute provides a counseling 
service where people who have 
recently been diagnosed with 
blindness can get assistance. 

According to Hatfield, the lead-
ing cause of blindness is muscular 
degeneration which is a part of the 
aging process. He said that the 
majority of the blind population is 
elderly. 

Hadield said the new facility 
still has some final construction 
projects to complete. A sensory gar-
den complete with a pebble path, 
aromatic plants, wind chimes and 
waterfalls is currently being built. 

Alyce Penhollow. a student at 
tile institute, said that she appreci-
ates the institute. 

"The new center is truly a mag-
ical place," Penhollow said.

TRANSATLANTIC TRAVELS TRANSCRIPTED 
Life of aviator Beryl Markham is the subject of Music Department graduate's piece for the La jolla Symphony 
By Bill Steinberg 
Staff Writer 

This Saturday and Sunday, the 
La Jolla Symphony and Chorus will 
perform at the premIere of compos-
er/pIanist Linda Kernonhan 's 
"Now, a Wanderer." a piece about 
the life uf English aviator Beryl 
Markham. Markham made aviation 
history in 1936 when she became 
the first person to fly solo nonstop 
from England to Nonh America. 

When Linda Kernonhan was 
commissioned to write a piece for 
the symphony and chorus last 
year, the UCSD graduate student 
said she knew right away that she 
wanted to focus it on the life of a 
famous woman, whether she be 
historical or fictional. Since the 
plots of most stories focus "more 
on Ithel relationships" of women 
"than on their talents:' according 
to Kernonhan. she eventually 
decided to look at the lives of 
some famous women in history for 
inspiration. 

After considering the lives of 
Sojoumer Truth. Eleanor Roosevelt 
and the biblical Ruth, Kemonhan 
said she still could not lind the right 
story to capture her imagination. 

"A good friend of mine sent me a 
copy of 'West With the Night' 
IMarkham's memoirsl ." Kemonhan 
,aid ... It may sound like a dichc. hut 
I knew from the first page that this 
was the story that I wanted to use." 

Markham led a very indepen-
dent and active life. which was 
uncommon for a woman of her 
generation. Born in 1902 in the 
colony of British East Africa. 
Markham grew up on a ranch. 
hunting wild boar and training her 
father 's rat:ehorse,. By her late 
20s she was making a living as a 
pilot, delivering supplies and pas-

sengers to remote areas and scout-
ing big game for hunters on safari . 

Markham made her decision to 
fly nonstop across the Atlantic 
Ot:ean bet:ause another seHler, 
John Carberry. who also finant:ed 
the flight. dared her to. While 
Charles Lindbergh was the first 
person to at:complish this feat, 
Markham was the lirst to do it 
from East to West. 

Markham's flight was actually 
much more dangerous than Lind-
bergh's. because she was flying 
into the wind, rather than with it. 
Her goal was to land in New York, 
but she was forced to crash-land in 
Nova Scotia after her engine 
became clogged with ice. When 
one considers that this could have 
happened at any time during the 
flight. Markham's daring and 
determination are apparent. 

Kernonhan took material 
diret:tly from the pilot 's memoirs 
for the text of "Now, a Wanderer" 
and she left it unchanged in order 
to bring the author's words to life. 
One can tell from the text that the · 
author wrote as she lived. with a 
great love of her home and flying, 
and each of the piece's five move-
ments seeks to express a different 
aspet:t of Markham's writings 
about her life. 

In describing the organization 
of the piece. Kernonhan stated that 
"three choral/vocal movements 
are interspersed with two orches-
tral tone poems (if I may be so 
brazen as to use such a term in the 
late 20th century!)." 

The composer's descriptions of 
the themes of each movement 
indicate a wide range of events 
and emotions. The vocal materials 
range from the spoken and sung 
names of Markham's chi ldhood 

African home, to the exhilaration 
and the sensations of learning to 
fly, to the happiness gained from 
success ... tempered by the desire 
for new adventure. The orchestral 
movements should prove to be no 
less dramatic, depicting (in 
"Movement II, The Race") one of 
Markham's early horse racing vic-
tories and its celebration, as well 
as the thrill of the danger of her 
historic "waterjump" (Markham'S 
term for her fear) in "Movement 
IV, The Flight." 

Kernonhan said she wa1i 
attracted to Markham's story 
because it "concerned the actions 
and achievements of a courageous 
and admirable individual," whoS'" 
feat "was nei-
ther t:om-
mon -

place nor easy." Kernonhan 
describes her musical style as 
"lyrical, expressive" and "with a 
tendency toward lush har-
monies." These elements of 
style do not follow the 
trends of most contem-
porary music, so it is 
clear that the compos-
er is writing in her 
own unique voice. 
Indeed, her desire to 
strive to capture and 
express the achievements 
of women, and of the human 
spirit in general, is far from com~ 
monplace.

OUTKAST LDNVERSATION 
SRTV and the Guardian interoiew the band 
By LIN Huff and Douc &r.yham 
Senior Staff Writer and Special to the Guardian 

OutKast was definitely a hit at the Price 
Center on Thursday evening, playing to an 
over-capacity crowd of at least 4000 people. 
This venue drew people from all over San 
Diego. as fans were not about to miss the 
opponunity to see a free show. Big Boi and 
Andre set the crowd in motion from the 
moment they stepped on stage. They played 
songs from all three of their albums for over 
an hour, mixing it up with live instrumentals 
and taking occational breaks to throw charg-
ing fans off the stage. Most notable was Mar-
cos Bollanos' mad dash for the stage that gar-
nered him his five seconds of fame before 
being tackled, beaten and thrown off stage. 
Bollanos seemed to set the stage early for the 
drunk and rowdy fans. From flying beer cans 
and fainting women to puking fans, the show 
was not for the weak of hean. 

Before the show, the Guardian was able to 
kick it in the bus with OutKast and the boys 
from "Ultra Jam" at SRTV. Here is what Out-
Kast had to say about their latest album. their 
current tour and their rise to fame. 
Q: How do ,011 feel IIbout ,.... ......

Ore: Well, it is a really hlessed situation. 
We hope that we continue doing what we

work on some new products we got. We got a 
new production company Earth Tones. y'all 
be hearin ' some new artists t:Omin' late 1999, 
early 2000. We got the Cool Breeze album 
about to come out. We on the first single. 
watch for the hook. We got the Goodie Mob 
album comin out, you know we gots to do the 
family thang, we got to keep that thang going. 
that's about it. What do you say, [Big Boij'! 

BB: Nothin' without a mic. G. (Ore passes 
the mic) Yo. I concur the same. we gettin' 
ready to work on this music.

BB: Basically. as far as equipment goes, I 
mean we got more flow so Iwe can] buy more 
pieces of equipment. you know what I'm 
sayin'. But as far as style of musit:. it goin' 
always change reguardless of the money or 
whatever. cause we just like to keep it new and 
fresh for you. We got to re-invent ourselves 
every time we drop a new album, so you ain't 
never goin' to get the same thing. You might 
get a little vibe from the last album. but every-
thing goin' to be different. though.

BB: Well, you know what I'm sayin', we 
sayin'like he [Ore] sayin' about the production 
label, we got some access comin' out under us, 
you know what I'm sayin' , they not goin' to 
sound like us, it is goin' to he totally different 
to the game. So that in itself is like takin a step 
up, you know. so as far as like kecpin' it tight 
we goin' to keep on making this music. keep 
makin ' it and makin ' it tight and building it up.

Ore: Well. I think physically we genin' a 
linle older, and musically we genin' a little 
older. You've got to understand what we' re 
doin' and from that pOint, from the first point 
you just go out there all wild. You don't know 
what's going on but you know it feels good 
plus you grow when you get a little older. you 
stan to learn the biz, stan to learn the music 
and the history and you stan to understand 
what you're doin ', so you can really freak it 
down once you really know what's goin on. 
So I think it 's a lot of growth and change. 

BB: The first album was an intro album, 
just lenin ' everyhody know who we were. 
From the dirty south, puttin it on the map. The 
second album ATLiells was basically we just 
like growin', OIaturin ', you know what I'm 
sayin', just really gettin' into our styles. find-
in' our niche and who we are you know. It· was 
like a growth album, this album is like lenin' 
everybody see the different:es bctwj~en Dre 
and myself. lenin' them know that two people 
from two totally different worlds can come 
together and make this thing happen like we 
do it, we goin' to keep on doin' it like that for 
real, you know that, biatch.

BLONDIE COMES BACK THROUGH THE EXIT 
70s sensation Blondie makes a final attempt at a musical impact in the pop entrenched' 90s 

By Clayton B. Payne 
Guardian Reporter 

Whether or not a flood of young 
girls threatens the nation 's supply 
of peroxide seems trivial to the 
cynical. However. Blondie 's retum 
marks a needed New Wave crest 
across the disheveled beach of pop 
music. It is an erroneous academic 
exercise to pass off this resurgence 
as a wake of nosta lgia. because No 
Exit proves thal B.londie arc an 
often imaginative pocket of musi-
cal styles normally lost in the 
sweeping currents of the radio dial.

year~ . the alhum remains contem-
porary Without abandoning the 
pas\. hut remains weak in its lyrical 
consistem:y. 

Claiming their name from a 
howling sexist phrase that truckers 
favored In harassing lead singer 
Debbie Harry. Blondie emerged in 
the mid-70s among the New York 
CBGB 's set. In addition to Harry. 
the group is comprised of guitarist 
Chris Stein, drummer Clem Burke 
and keyboardi t Jimmy Destri . This 
combination of musicians naturally 
cemented themselves around a 
punk ethic and a melodic chic that 
further alienated them from both 
the "true" punk and the avant-
garde. However. those who bathed 
in the smoky shadows of CBGBs 
found something enthralling in 
Blondie. setting them on the course 
for major succe~s . The rest. as the 
cliche goes. is history. 

Five years at the top eventually 
sucked the life out of Blondie in a 
creative ebb, leaving the group 
apparently dead after 1982's Tire 
Hunter. Stein and Harry remained 
together; however Harry 's attempt 
at a solo career dissolved before it 
began. When Stein developed a 
crippling, often fatal illness. Harry 
devoted herself to hi s recovery 
rather than her career. The next 15 
years offered only a few singles 
worth notice to those outside the 
band\ devoted flock . 

The Blondie sound found voice 
In a new generation of artists. 
who,e attllmpts were mostl y 
insignilicant ripples of a once con-
suming swell. "Rapture" intro-
duced middle America to a rap and 
rock hybrid. yet few explored the 
comhination other than to margin-
aliLe it or use it as a musical gag. as 
with Aerosmith's insipid romp with 
Run DMC and Rush's monotonous 
"Roll The Bones." Only Mr. Bun-
gle's Mike Patton (later of Faith No 
More) explored the limits with any 
semblance of purpose. paving the 
way for current pop sensations like 
Everlast. The dangerous glamour 
image of Blondie deteriorated with 
the emergence of No Doubt. while 
Garbage successfully applied the 
Phil Spector "wall of sound" to the 
formula . 

No Exit. the title taken from a 
Jean-Paul Sartre play, boasts one of 
the playwright 's most famous 
quotes "No one can say we didn't 

hold out for 15 minutes." Blondie 
included this as an admonishment 
to those who rolled out with the 
tide. and as a waming to those who 
might suffer the same fate . 
"Maria." the first single. hints at a 
lamentation for those who have 
compromised their convictions, but 
is, however. far from being the 
strongest track. "Nothing is Real 
But the Girl: ' on the other hand. is 
a very strong track and serves as 
both a n:action and a renection. 
combining the characteristic pump-
ing tempos and video game-like 
keyboard ornamentation of New 
Wave with the more abusive guitar 
sty les of current rock. Burke's 
Keith Moon fantasies tind life dur-
ing the refrain , while pointed 
lyrics. "airplanes are snorting run-
ways under clear blue skies," 
secures the mind within a critique 
of the conventional gimmicks of 
modem media. 

The title track picks up from 
where "Rapture" left off, yet comes 
a,cross as forced. Coolio's presence 
is almost hypocritical in view of 
the critical element that pervades 
the album. The lyrics are quite seri-
ous, asking "who's gonna cry for 
the youth?". but the nonsense about 

vam pirc~. a poorly chosen 
metaphor. only further disrespects 
the intent of the cautionary mes-
sage. Although interesting. in terms 
of being a missing link between 
themselves and the work of Pallon 
and Everlast. the song "No Exit" is 

It's not a

trite by today's standards. saved 
only by a moderately interesting 
guitar solo. 

The first track Df the album. 
"Screaming Skin" shows up No 
Doubt on how to blend ska and 
rock. but the song's failure is with 
its asinine lyrics. Heckling the 
stereo is a healthy response when 
Harry screams. "Don't call me 
germ." However. in the album 
overall. the lyrics live up to the 
music more than fail it. 

Blondie are at their best while 
taking risks on songs. "Boom 
Boom in the Zoom Zoom Room." 
as inane as it sounds, is a swim 
through the life of a lounge lizard 
in full swing. Harry's voice. though 
aged. playfully darts around phras-
es while the band vamps in a gentle 
bounce that screams Vegas, but 
Vegas via the Hollywood Strip. The 
Saxophone adds just the right 
amount of cheese to carry off the 
charade with class. Switching from 
a blues introduction to a disco strut. 
"Happy Dog" convinces the listen-
er that this was a record that 
Blondie. as a band. wanted to 
make. The satire imbedded within 
the lyrics works as a counterpoint 
to the sultriness Harry gets out of 
her voice. As one of Stein's compo-
sitions. it showcases a quality of 
John Waters' camp while maintain-
ing the same sense of maturity that 
set his earliest work above the 
norm of New Wave. 

Not content with giving only 

new material. the disc also contains 
recently recorded live versions of 
three classic Blondie songs. 
"Dreaming" is dense with energy 
never fully captured on the original 
release, so that Harry is now more 
convincing when she sings. "I'm 
no debutante." Burke's style of 
drumming. which was always too 
60s for New Wave standards. is 
alive and confrontational. especial-
lyon "Call Me." The live rendering 
of "Rapture." complete with 
poignantly timed pregnant pauses 
reminds one just why Blondie 
deserves their success. The smile 
that must have wrapped Harry's 
face from ear to ear comes across'i n 
her articulation of the rap segment, 
which. in context, escapes being 
condemned for its ridiculous 
nature. 

Blondie are back. older. perhaps 
not wiser. hut no less captivating 
than they were in the heights of 
their career - even more so in 
some respects. By making music 
on their own terms. the reunion 
sparks the question as to what pos-
sibilities evaporated during their 
self-imposed exile. escaping servi-
tude to the cooperate current of the 
music industry. Although occasion-
ally diluted. the pure Blondie of No 
Exit is not just for the drifting fan. 
but for those who appreciate exper-
imentation in pop music. Blondie 
may not push the outer edge of the 
high water mark anymore. but they 
still point out that it needs testing.

MARCH MADNESS INVADES HOLLYWOOD 
The nominations for the 1999 Academy Awards have been casted. Who will win the golden prize? 
By David Yen 
Scaff Wnler 

II '> Man:h. and that mcan, that 
Ihe O~car, an: nO! far away. Thl' 
)c:ar. the colilpelilion I~ more Ilcr..:e 
than ever. "SavlIlg Prlvale Ryan" 
and "ShaJ..cspearc: In Lovc" appear 
\\.:11 pmllioned 10 slrlke go ld on 
O,CM ni gh!. bUI who J..now, whal 
Il.:cherg' sland In Iheir path? Here'> 
a category by calegory analysl, for 
Ihi, ycar's A..:ademy Awards. 
B •• t Plctur. 

This ycar 's I.: hoicc, include 
three films about World War II and 
two about thc Elilahclhan era. In 
lerms of critical al.:claim, Stcven 
Splclberg's "Saving Prlvalc Ryan" 
IS thc c1car front-runner. It i . a gril-
ty. terrifyingly realistic account of 
thc D-Day invasion on Normandy 
heach. The combination of Tom 
Hanks and Stevcn Spiclberg is vir-
tually unbcatablc. especially whcn 
it comes 10 Oscar consideration . 
But there arc other factors. 

First, IS thc "Iovc" factor. The 
Academy often favors lilms that tcll 
it deeply. moving lovc story involv-
ing people from differcnt classes or 
backgrounds (i .e. 'The English 
Pallen!." "Titanic"). Givcn Ihis 
il>SUmplion. the romantic comedy 
"Shakc'>pearc In Love" ha, a bener-
Ihan-a \eragc .. hOI al wlllning. 
"Shakespean: in Love" IS much eas-
Icr on the eyc~ than Ihe massive 
hloodshed in "Ryan." and it also 
garnered Ihe most number of noml-
nallons. 0 lilm in the last live 
years Ihat ,cored the mn,t nomlna-

tions has lost for best picturc. 
Then. there is the "split-votc" 

factor. Sometime~ when movie, 
L1ealing with the same subject com-
pete agai n,1 each 01 her. Acadcmy 
vOlcr .. \plil their vote, and an 
unLlerLlog ends up taking the cake. 
"Shakcsp~are in Love" cou ld ~p liJ 

It~ VOIC ~ harc with thc more seri ou~ 
"Eli.whcth," thu, be~towing a gold 
,t<ll uelte on the prccious Italian 
import "Life i, Beautiful." But no 
foreign tihn has cver won best pic-
ture. Confused yct? You should be. 

All things aside, this promises to 
be one of the most closely contested 
Oscar races in years. But herc's the 
hottom line. "Shakespeare in Love" 
may have a chancc. but when is thc 
last time a comedy won best picture? 
"Elizabeth" was a long shot to even 
be nominated. "Lire is Beautirul" 
will probably walk away with the 
best roreign-Ianguage film prize (a 
suitablc consolation to give Ameri-
can films the spotlight). That leaves 
"Saving Private Ryan" and ''The 
Thin Red Line." Compare prcvious 
works. Malick directed a movie enti-
tled "Days of Heaven." Spielberg 
helmcd "E,T.." "Indiana Jones," 
"Jurassic Park" and "Schindlcr 's 
LIS\''' Expect Spielherg to walk 
away with Oscars for best picture 
and dlreclor come Oscar nigh\. 
Best SUpportlnC Actor 

Ed Harri s won the Golden 
Globe for hi, ponrayal of Christof 
In "The Truman Show." But the 
Academy ,eelllS In have an aver-
~ I on to hOlh Harris and his movie. 

"The Truman Show" was snuhbed 
in most categories, including bcst 
picturc. where many critics consid-
ered il a lock. Rohert Duvall ("A 
Civil Action") and lame, Coburn 
CAlfhcllon") gavc · ,olid perfor-
mam:e,. hUI have failed to generate 
Significant cri tical bUll . 

ThaI leaves versatile Geoffrey 
Ru,h ("S hakespeare in Lovc") and 
cccentric Billy Bob Thornton ("A 
Simplc Plan"). Rush could have 
been nominatcd for any onc of 
three fantastic performances ("Lcs 
Mi serablcs." "Elilabeth," "Shake-
speare in Love"). But Billy Bob 
Thornton is sensational as a pathet-
ic. yet lovahlc loser who provides 
the moral guidance ror "A Simple 
Plan." Count on him making the 
journcy to thc podium. 
.... SUpportlnC Actr ... 

Usually in this category, the 
Academy picks thc youngest nomi-
nee. Juliette Binoche. Anna Paquin 
and Marisa Tomei arc all evidence 
of this. Continuing the trend would 
spell a victory for Rachel Gritlith of 
"Hilary and Jackie," but this seems 
unlikely. So what are we left with 
next"? Judi Deneh could win ror 
"Shakespeare in Love." hut she only 
appears in two scenes of the cntirc 
Ii 1m. Kathy Batcs ("Primary Col-
ors") and Brcnda Blethyn CSccrets 
and Lie,") have out,idc shots, but 
my votc is for Golden Globe winner 
Lynn Rcdgrave. who turned heads 
a, a cru,ty housekceper in the indie 
hit "God~ and Mon,ters."

Sorry Tom. Thc other odds-on

That Icaves Italian superstar 
Roberto Benigni, youngster 
Edward Nonon, and veteran actors 
Nick Nolte and Ian McKellen. 
Bcnigni is brilliant in the tragi-
comedy "Life is Beautiful." Not 
many actor/directors can succcss-
fully execute a "comcdy" about the 
Holocaust wonhy of a five-minute 
standing ovation at the Jewish Film 
Festival. Nonon was very good in 
as a neo-nali skinhcad in "Ameri-
can History X," but his nomination 
seems to be his solc reward. 

But thc honor boils down to 
Noltc and McKellen . Nolte, in 
"Affliction," plays a troubled. 
, mall-time. alcoholic sheriff. remi -
niscent of Nicholas Cagc's turn in 
"Lcaving Las Vegas." His perfor-
mance. howevcr. may bc decmcd 
too dcpressing. thus leaving Ian 
MI.:Kellcn ("Gods and Monsters") 
as Ihe last man standing. Alrcady 
the rccipient of the National Board 

of Review and L.A. Film Critics' 
awards, McKellen looks poised to 
add another trophy to his mantle. 
a.at Actr ... 

Il 's a two-horse racc : Cate 
Blanchell and Gwyneth Paltrow, 
stars of the up-coming serial thriller 
'The Talented Mr. Ripley," facc off 
as Queen Elil.abeth and an aspiring 
Elilabethan actress in rival films 
"Elil.abeth" and "Shakespeare in 
Love." But first, the other con-
tenders. Meryl Streep lights up the 
screen in every role she's ever becn 
in, but "Onc "Irue Thing" suffcred 
from lackadaisical reviews. Fernan-
da Montenegro captured early crit-
ics' awards for her role in the Brazil-
ian impon "Central Station." She 
will be hard pressed to win, howev-
er, lacking nalne recognition in the 
United States. Montenegro who? 

Blanchell and Paltrow ·have 
much in common. Both are beauti-
ful, young actresses who exhibit 
grace and passion in their work. 
Blanchcll won the Golden Globe, 
but Paltrow deserves tbe edge for 
many reasons. She's been in many 
recent tilms, including "Great 
Expectations" and the critically 
acclaimed "Emma." Finally, she's 
from the United States. In past ycars. 
Brcnda Blethyn and Judi Dench hoth 
lost out to younger Amcrican

PREVIEW: 
Child is discovered 
with his kidnappers 
ContInued fro. paC. 11 
Whoopi Goldberg, Treat Williams 
and Jonathan Jackson. 

outlook: Looks to be a realtejlr-
jerking, triumph-of-thc-family son 
of lihn. There's no question that 
thesc actors can't pull it off. but it's 
questionable whether audiences will 
choose a sob story over the alterna-
tives. 

The Rage: Carrie 2 
" ...... : Don't believe the 

hype. While this lilm creates a con-
vincing illusion of being a sequel. 
it's nOlhing more than a repackaged 
version of the origina~ for the 90s. 

Play..: Seeing as how this 
appears to be Emily Bergl's (Rachel) 
first film and the directors Robert 
Mandel and Katt Shea are relatively 
untested, it's difficult to get a sense 
of what to expect from their work. 

outlook: Everything I've seen 
about this movie makes mc think I'd 
much rather rent the (lriginal "Car-
rie" with Sissy Spacek and save 
myself f()ur bucks. 

Baby Geniuses 
" •• 1 •• • As if "Look Who's 

Talking Now" wasn't enough tor-
tun:. now wc've got ballies a la 
"Small Soldiers" running all ovcr tbe 
silver screen. 

P.., .... : Kathleen Turner 
(yick). Dom DeLuisc and Christo-
phcr Lloyd star in this ncw low in 
clllema history. 

outlook: If you're not already 
sick -to-deat h, want-IO-S I i t-your-
own-throat fed-up with tbe "dancing 

baby" shtick then you need profes-
sional help and this film may be just 
the ticket. (I swear though, if they 
make a singing and dancing pet 
movie I'm going to lose my mind.) 

MARCH I' 
The King and I 

" ..... : Warner Brothers 
(despite the fact it looks very Disney-
csque) is distributing this rip-off of 
the classic musical by Rodgers and 
Hammerstein. Supposedly, this ani-
mated version is a straight translation 
of the Broadway musical of a British 
teacher named Anna who travels to 
Siam to tutorthe children of the king. 

PI8y.-.: Miranda Richardson 
(speaking) and Christiane Noll 
(signing) pertorm the voices for the 
character of Anna. Manin Vidnovic 
perfOrms the voi(.'C of the King. 

outlook: 11le illustrators of this 
film could nOl have done a better job 
making the King of Siam look cxact-
Iy like Yul Brynncr. Whilc it's 
strange that tbey would choose to 
mimic thc original's look so com-
plctcly. lack of animated competi-
tion will help this film do well . 

Forces of Nature 
" •••• e: Hunky stud happens 

to meet sexy lady on the way to his 
wedding but despite his allegiance to 
his bride-to-be, fate (and thc weath-
er) have other plans in store for this 
star-crossed couple. 

PIIIy..: Ben "I'm in cvery 
movic now" Aflleck plays the hunky 
stud while his unlikely soul mate is 
played by Sandra Bullock. Maura 
Tierncy, David Strickland and Steve 
Zahn makc up the supponing cast. 

outlook: Probably the kind of 
romance for those who believc that 

The UCSD Guardian 

love and fate work in strange ways. 
This film has the kind of slick, pol-
ished feel that implies a strong story 
line. 

True Crime 
" ...... : Steve Everell has 

problems, a lot of problems. He 
drinks, hc womanizes, be works at a 
newspaper and he's discovered proof 
of a convicted murderer's innocence 
the day before his execution. 

P .. y .... : Clint Eastwood 
(Everell) once again directs and stars 
in this film. Isaiah Washington plays 
the convict while James Woods 
plays Everell's boss. 

outlook: If you liked "Absolute 
Power" (Eastwood's last actor/direc-
!or extravaganza) this film looks to 
be more of the same brand of sus-
pense and intrigue. 

MARCH 26 
EDtv 

" .... e: Picture ' ~fhc Truman 
Show" without all thc ontological 
crap. To save a cablc channel's 
slipping ratings. exccutives decide 
to put Ed Pckurny's Iifc on the air 
24 hours a day. No actors, no 
scripts, no editing. The show is a 
huge success but Ed isn't sure he 
can handle the famc. 

PI8y.-.: Director Ron Howard 
brings together the talents of 
Matthew M(:Conaugbey (Ed), Jenna 
Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Ellen 
DeGeneres, Rob Reincr, Dennis 
Hopper and Elizabeth Hurley. 

outlook: After being the lone 
person in my life who was thorough-
ly disappointed with 'The Truman 
Show," it's a real pleasure to see 
another group of actors take another 
stab at the formula. 

SUMMER S E S S 

The Mod Squad 
............ These three unlikely 

"heros" are high school dropouts 
who are arrested for drug use. In lieu 
of ajail sentence,the youths agree to 
work undercover for the police and 
are subsequently set loose in the 
underworld of Las Angeles to catch 
the "bad guys." 

....,..: Claire Danes, Omar 
Epps and Giovanni Rabisi play the 
Mod Squad under the supervision of 
a police oflicer played by Dennis 
Farina. 

Outlook: Ahhh! Will the tide .of 
'70s TV remakes never stop? This 
recreation may rise well above oth-
ers of its genre but it won't be long 
before audiences will be forced \0 sit 
through "CHiPs: The Motion Pic-
ture" or 'The Greatest American 
Hero: The Movie." Wow, that would 
be great! 

MARCH 31 
The Matrix 

" .. 1 .. : A dark, futuristic 
thriller about a man who discovers 
that his whole life has been an 
orchcstrated vinual dream. Oncc hc 
awakens from his dream he joins the 
fight against those responsible for 
his virtual brainwashing. 

Players: Keanu Recvcs and 
Laurence Fishburne star as the prin-
cipal characters. 

Outlook: Forget about Johnny 
Mnemonic. This latest Reeves flick 
seems to have all the panache of last 
year's "Dark City."

any easier when the controllers get 
involved in an intense rivalry with

their careers, marriages and planes. 

Play..: Director Mike Newell 
("Four Weddings and a Funeral" and 
"Donnie Brasco") brings togethcr 
John Cusack and Billy Bob Thorn-
ton. 

OUtlook: Too early to tell yet 
but this film could creatc a uniquc 
look at an exciting atmosphere 
which doesn't often get much mcn-
tion. 

Mystery Alaska 
PrenIIse: Sex scandals, hidden 

secrets, prying cyes and political 
hypocrisies plague the small, remote 
town of Mystery, Alaska. That is. 
until the town's amateur hockcy 
team accepts the challenge of a facc-
off against the New York Rangcrs

peny rivalries aside. 

PIIIyen: Russcll Crowc, Hank 
Azaria, Mary McCormack, Lelita 
Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm 
Mcaney, Maury Chaykin and Bun 
Reynolds star. 

OUtlook: The cast for this film

PREVIEW: 
Barrymore forced to 
relive adolescence 
ContInued "... ..... 17 
the reporter (Geller) and she is 
joined by "Saturday Night Live" 
comic Molly Shannon and David 
Marshall. 

OUtlook: Drew Barrymore's 
newfound fame can't last long. espe-
cially if she finds hersclf stuck in a 
rut of '80s throwback movies. She 
has the talent to pull herself out 
though, provided she gets the right 
script. 

APRIL 16 
Molly 

" •• 1 •• : Molly McKay is a 
mentally challenged young woman 
whose intelligence is set free after a 
program of highly experimental 
treatments. Her brother Buck is not 
ready to care for a sister that he has-
n't seen since they were children and 
his life is turned upside down. 

Plllyen: Elisabeth Shue and 
Aaron Eckhart play the s ister and 
brother McKays. 

Outlook: Hollywood loves to 
.see double and this is clearly an 
aftershock of 'The Other Sister." 
However, it's bound to have it 's 
share of amusing and touching 
moments. 

A Hard Day's Night 
"eMIIe: Miramax is redistrib-

uting this classic rock musical for its 
35th anniversary. Dodging hordes of 
screaming fans and getting involved 
in plenty of other high-jinx, the Bea-
ties endeavor to make their way to 
taping a television appearance. 

Plllyen: John Lennon, Paul 
McCartney, George Harrison and 
Ringo Starr ... who else? 

Outlook: This film is acknowl-
edged by many critics as one of the 
best musicals ever made and it will 
be a treat to see it on the big screen. 

MAY I 
Entrapment 

~ An insurance investi-
gator believes that the only way to 
catch a legendary thief is to pose as a 
thief herself'. The two get to know 
each other and as their mutual attrac-
tion (and distrust) in each other 
grows. they plan a huge robbery on 
the eve of the new millennium. 

.-..,...: Sean Connery, Cather-
ine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames and 
Will Patlon star in this sexy adven-
ture story. 

OUtlook: It could be great, it 
could be awful, but it's for damn 
sure going to be sexy. (It just better 
not be as bad as '"The Avengers.") 

A Midsummer Night's 
Dream 

" ..... : Two groups of mor-
tals are toyed with by the spirits 
who dwell in the forests and glens 
outside Tuscany in this adaptation 
of Shakespeare's comedy. 

PIIIy--= Rupert Everett 
(Oberon), Michelle PfeifTer (Tita-
nia), Stanley Tucci (Puck), Kevin 
Klein (Bottom), Calista Aockheart 
(Helena) and David Strathaim star in 
the film directed by Michael Hoff-
man ("One Fine Day," "Soapdish"). 

OUtlook: A colorful retelling of 
the classic tale with an impressive 
cast of actors and actresses. Follow-
ing the success of "William Shake-
speare's Romeo and Juliet" and 

Thursday, March II, 1999 

"Shakespeare in Love" should also 
help its success at the box office. 

MAY 21 
Star Wan: Episode I 
The Phantom Menace 

" •• 1 •• : In the first episode of 
the Star Wars saga, Luke Skywalk-
er's father Anakin is a 9-year-old 
boy, Obi-Wan Kenobi is a young 
Jedi Knight and Qui-Gon Jinn is his 
Jedi master, trying to train his 
apprentice in the midst of intergalac-
tic political turmoil. The descrt plan-
et of Tatooine, the galactic capital 
world of Coruscant, the green world 
of Naboo, and the familiar charac-
ters Yoda, R2-D2, C-3PO and Jabba 
the Hutt will make an appearance in 
the highly anticlpated prequel. 

PIIIJ--= Liam Neeson (Qui-
Gon Jinn), Ewan McGregor (Obi-
Wan Kenobi), Jake Lloyd (Anakin 
Skywalker) and Natalie Portman star. 

Outlook: Impressive. most 
impressive. Corne join me camping 
out in front of the AMC 20 seventh 
week. 

The Love Letter 
....... ee: Going head-to-head 

against Star Wars is the slory of a 
sleepy New England lown which 
wakes up upon finding an un~igned 
love letter. As the letter gets pass-
esd around town, the townspeople 
discover a renewed interest in each 
other. 

.-..,...: Kate Capshaw. Blythe 
Danner. Ellen DeGeneres. Tom 
Everett Scott and Tom Selleck star. 

o.tIooIc If I was in this movie 
and wanted anyone to see it I'd be 
praying that it's release date gets 
changed.

you had to do was ask, "He get one 
today?" and everyone knew what 
you were talking about. 

It was very similar to the fahu-
lous summer of 1998. when all you 
had to do was ask about Big Mac 
or Sammy, and everyone knew Ihat 
you wanted an updale on Ihe 
homer hunt. 

Unlike most players who have 
their careers turned into legend, 
DiMaggio was one in that very 
elile class that allained legendary 
status during his career. When he 
strode into a room (from what I've 
read, the Clipper never walked, he 
simply glided) everyone knew 
they were in the presence of a leg-
end. 

In fact, DiMaggio was such a 
revered figure that the era's Iledg-
ling media ignored his injury or 
off-the· field problems. They knew 
that DiMaggio was above such 
petty scrutiny. How many athletes 
get thattoday'l 

It was one of DiMaggio's 01'1'-
the-field exploits that furthered his 
legend, He married Marilyn. 
Marilyn Monroe is perhaps the 
most mysterious, legendary woman 
in modem American history. 

Her companionship was 
reserved for only the most fantas-
tic personalities of her time. Men 
like John F. Kennedy were in Ihal 
group, and so was DiMaggio. 

DiMaggio was a true American 
hero - the kind of hero that tran-
scended baseball. He was worthy 
of Ernest Hemingway 's immortal-
ization in the literary classic, The 
Old Man alld the Sea . 

He was such an intricate piece 
of America 's cultural fiber that 
Paul Simon's line, "Where have 
you gone, Joe DiMaggio." in 
Simon and Garfunkel's famous 
song, Mrs. Robinson, is seen as a 
call to innocence lost. 

Perhaps the best way to remem-
ber Joe D. is reflected in a conver-
sation he had with his wife 
Mari Iyn after she entertained 
100,000 servicemen in Korea: 

"It was so wonderful, Joe," she 
said. "You never heard such cheer-
ing." 

"Yes I have," he answered.

The 
Coach 
Travis Hili 

IpsetC· ForUCSD 
A Homage to an 
American Legend 

Brace yourselve~ . faithful 
readers. this wlumn is actually 
going to be a somber one. I can't 
help it - there is nothing funny 
about the pussing of Joe 
DiMaggio. 

He wa~ known as Joe D .. 
Joltin ' Joe, and the Yankee 
Clipper. hut he will forever he 
remembered a~ not only a hase-
hall legend, hut a pleL:\: of 
Amencan folklore . 

Unfortunately. I noticed that 
hiS pas~ing did not quite affect 
the members 01 my generation. 
As I walked around schexll, no 
one really talked ahout him. 
Sadly. I don' t think we appreci-
ate the value of what we los\. 

The son of Italian immi-
grant~ , DiMaggio played hase-
ball at a time when it was the 
mo,t important sport in 
America. No other ,port came 
cio,e to approaching baseball 's 
inlluence. 

If you were a basehall star. 
you were a very special ce lehri-
ty. If you were the hest player 
on the World Champion !'lew 
York Yankees. you were per-
haps the most famous man in 
the world. 

Joltin ' Joe tit the hill. He was 
the Yankees ' center fielder and 
best player. He was the leader of 
this unstoppable machine that 
from 1936-39. won three wn-
,ecutive World Championship, 
and was never even threatened. 
Many ex perts (including 
ESPN 's Peter Gammons) wn-
Sider that Yankee team to be hi,-
tory 's hest. 

It wasn ' t DiMaggio 's statis-
tics that made him legendary. 

"It is not for DiMaggio's 
records that we remember 
him," writes Ira Berkow of The 
Nelli York Times. "He is best 
remembered for the persona of 
Joo DiMaggio. He remains a 
living symbol of excellence, 
elegance, power and, to be sure, 
gentleness. " 

He played for 13 wondrous 
season, in the Big Apple and 
racked up two hailing titles and 
three MVP awards. More 
importantly. of his 13 L:am-
paigm.. the Yankees won the 
American League pennant 10 
times. They won haseball's 
World Championship an unbe-
lievable 9 times. 

The most famou, number 
allached to DiMaggio's legend, 
however, is 56. In the 1941 sea-
son - which some consider to 
be the greatest of all-time 
DiMaggio hit in a record 56 
consecutive games. 

It was this streak that forever 
put Joe D. in the annals of 
American lore. Everyday during 
his streak, in any part of the 
country, in any conversation, all

UCSD beat Montclair St., last year's Division III National rnnner-up, 3-0 
By Brian Welles 
Staff Writer 

Triton fans have witnessed 
baseball at its finest during the past 
wuple of days at Triton field. 

The UCSO baseball team 
emerged from a two-game series 
against Montclair SI. (N.J.) with a 
split after winning, 3-0. last 
Monday and falling. 1-0, on 
Sunday. The Montclair S\. Red 
Hawks. who were the NCAA 
Division III National Runners-Up 
last season. provided a stiff test for 
the Tritons. who answered the call. 

Both tea1fls wuld not provide 
loads of offense on Sunday and 
Monday because they used wooden 
bats. Montclair S\. is involved in a 
unique agreement with the NCAA 
that forces the Red Hawks and their 
opponents to use wooden bats 
when they play. Obviously, hits off 
wooden bats don ' t travel as far as 
hits off of aluminum. 

For instance. back-to-back dou-
bles by Kenny Fluharty and Eric 
Thorpe in the bottom of the fourth 
on Monday might have amounted 
to two homers under other circum-
stances. 

Nevertheless, the magnitude of 
these two at-bats were crucial to 
the outcome of the game. The hits 
opened up the Triton lead to 2 runs 
over the Red Hawks after four 
innings of play. 

Later. in the seventh, UCSD 
.took advantage of Montclair 

Usa Huff/G~/an 
T ..... It: Triton second baseman Kenny Fluharty makes a great play in Monday's 3{) upset win over 
Montclair State. Fluharty also did it with his bat in the win, roping an RBl-double and stealing a base. 

UCSD bench flew out of the 
dugout to congratulate the outfield-
er/pinch runner. 

"We work very hard on the little 
things that win. [such as] the 

4 hits. He did this despite the using 
only two of his four pitches. During 
the game, he mixed his four-seam 
fastball with his curve, which 
forces hillers to contend with a 20-
mph drop-off in speed. . SI. reliever Rob Burton's

extra bases we take or 
stealing a bag," Head 

Coach Dan O' Brien 
said . 

At a point in the 

battle - like it's a war to be won. 
In addition, he preaches about the 
team working toward running on 
all cylinders so that it is playing 4-
point baseball - meaning the 
Tritons are performing well with 
respect to hitting, pitching, fielding 
and baserunning. Baserunning is 
not always an area of focus for a 
baseball team, but the Tritons 
proved Monday that it is a vital 
component of a winning team. 

UCSO reliever Brian Hinson 
entered in the seventh inning on 
Monday and kepi Ishak's master-
piece intact by pitching shut-out 
ball the rest of the way. Hinson, 
who is vying for the Triton single-

Lions Roar in Triton Defeat 
GODS: UCSD's bad-luck season continued against Loyola Marymount 
By Travis Hili 
Associate Sports Editor 

If it wasn't obvious before, it is 
n9w: the Gods are definitely not 
smiling on the UCSO men's vol-
leyhall squad. 

Last weekend, the Tritons 
snapped their seven-game 
losing streak with an out-
standing sweep 
against UC 
Santa Cruz. 

It was a nice win for 
the Tritons, as they were 
finally rewarded their quality 
play of late. However, despite the 
momentum Head Coach Jon 
Stevenson's troops gained in the 
UCSC win, UCSO ran into one of 

the hottest teams in the nation on 
Tuesday in No. 9 Loyola 
Marymount University and the 
Lions dispatched the Tritons, 15-7. 
15-2, 15-9. 

The first game was a bit sloppy, 
as both teams struggled to main-

tain a consistent attack. 
Finally, as is the case 

with most of the 
Division I teams 
UCSO has 

played this year. when 
the going gets tough, the 

tough rely on height. 
UCSO's lack thereof has been a 

factor in many of its matches, and 
the first game of the Loyola match 
was no exception as the Lions 

rolled to a 15-7 win. 
The second game was very 

tough on UCSO. The Lions showed 
just how on fire they were as they 
bounced the Tritons, 15-2. Every 
aspect of Loyola's gaine was work-
ing extremely well for the team. 

As a result, UCSO's allack per-
centage was a miserable, negative 
. 120. It was a rough game as the 
Lions rolled. Nevertheless, UCSO 
would not allow itself to be further 
embarrassed in the third game. 

The Lions might have won the 
third game, but they were definite-
ly outplayed by the smaller Tritons. 
UCSO out-hit the Lions, .415 to 
.392. The Tritons came out swin,-
