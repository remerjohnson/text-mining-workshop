Warren students approve $4 
activity fee referendum 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

More than 450 Earl Warren 
College students, or roughly 60 
percent of tho e who voted in a 
week-long pecial election, 
approved a S4-per-quarter activity 
fee, beginning in fall of 2004. The 
vote makes Warren the last col-
lege on campus to institute an 
acti vi ty fee . 

Almost 800 tudents, slightly 
more than 17 percent of the total 
Warren population, voted on the 
referendum, meeting the 15 -per-
cent quorum required to approve 
the fee . 

"I'm exci ted because Warren 
now has the resources to imple-
ment our ideas," Warren College 
Student Council President Erik 
Ward said . 

Sophomores represented the 
largest group of voters, with 251 
participating, followed closely 
behind by juniors, according to 
the results released by WCSC 
officials. Freshmen turned out to 
the pol1s in the fewest numbers, 
with just more than 100 participat-

Renowned primatologistJane 
Goodall was awarded the fourth-

A.S. Council 
resolution 

backs black 
studies 

By MMNmE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

The A.S. Council recently 
adopted a resolution calling for the 
establishment of a black studies 
program at UCSD on April 28. 
Thurgood Marshall College 
Student Council passed a similar 
resolution on April 29. 

Outgoing· Thurgood Marshall 
College Student Council Chair 
Travis Silva authored and submit-
ted the resolution to the A.S. 
Council. Silva said that the resolu-
tion shows the amount of student 
suppan on campus for tt- ... pro-
gram. 

The legislation resolved that 
the A.S. Council calls on the 
UCSD administration, faculty and 
Academic Senate to establish a 
black studies program at UCSD 
"without any funher delay." The 
resotution also states that the pro-
gram would promote recruitment 
and retention of students of color 
atUCSD. 

The raoIution stites that the 
student body has been c:oncemed 
with the establishment of a black 
studies program since 1968. 
Ac:cordint to Silva, the idea of the 
raoIucion came after the TMC 
Student Council looked into the

Students participate 
in service actiVities 
Annual 'Hands on San Diego' 
project attracts more than 300 

By SHANNON EUOT 
Staff Writer 

In an effort to promote volun-
teering and the spirit of goodwill, 
UCSD students gathered early on 
the morning of May I to partici -
pate in II community servi ce 
tasles throughout the San Diego 
area . Sponsored by the A.S. 
Volunteer Connection, the 13th 
annual Hands on San Diego pro-
ject attracted more than 300 ru-
dents seeking to assist in various 
community projects. 

Shortly before participants 
were sent to their assigned loca-
tions, Thurgood Mar hall 
College Provost Cecil Lytle 
spoke about the importance of 
public service. 

"Why should we demand that 
you develop your computational 
skills but not your citizenship 
skills?" Lytle said. "Join with the 
colleges in the challenges of insti-
tutionalizing citizenship endeav-
ors." 

Lytle also urged that the vol-
unteers' involvement not end 
with the conclu ion of the day. 

"Don't [volunteer] just to meet 
a cute gi rl or guy," Lytle said. "I 
hope your [community ervlce 
involvement] doe n't end in your 
mind at 5 p.m. today. This is a day 
of refl ection and thought in what 
it means to be a member of this 
community. " 

Activities ranged from admin-
istrative ta ks to physical labor, on 
campus and in the greater an 
Diego area. 

Marshall enior Ma.rgare t 
C han led a trash cleanup at Ro e 
Creek near Pacific Beach . 
According to C han, approximate-
ly 20 people pdrticipated in rid-
ding the creek area of litter. 

"We stayed until about noon 
because we did as much a po i-
ble," Chan said. "Eventually 
there was no more trash to pick 
up."

UC ranked high for low-
income student enrollment 

SIX UC campuses enroll the most low-
income students out of schools listed in the 
US. News and World Report top 50 universi-
ties, according to a study by Tom Mortenson of 
Postsecondary Education Opportunity. The 
study examined the number of federal Pell 
C rant recipients each university enrolled, 
among other factors. 

\ UCLA ;~nked the highest of the UC campus-
es, with 35.1 percent of its students coming 
from low-income families, followed by UC 
Berkeley with 32.4 percent, UC Irvine with 31.5 
percen~ UC Davis with 28.5 percent, UCSD with 

28.3 percent and UC Santa Barnara with 24.8 
percent. According to the university, the other 
two UC undergraduate campuses, UC Riverside 
and UC Santa Cruz, also enroll a large number 
of low-income students, but did not rank within 
the u.s. News and World Report top 50. 

UC officials attributed its success in enrolling 
low~ncome students to a strong state grant pro-
gram, a past policy of returning one-third of all fee 
increases to financial aid, past academic outreach 
programs and a focus on Califomia residents 
through the Califomia Master Pian for Education. 

Recent budget reduction proposals targeting 
the Cal GrantJrogram, the amount of fee 
increases appli toward financial aid programs 
and academic outreach programs threaten the 
university's ability to service low-income students, 
according to the UC Office of the President

MONDAY. MAY 3, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEW. 1 

Report calls for changes to A.S. 
. representation structure 

Colleges shuffle on ... carnpus 
housing spaces for next year 

Iy BRYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

The A.S. Task Force on 
Representation Strucrure released 
its final report on A.S. representa-
tion on April 20. The task force's 
recommendations include the 
establishment of an open commit-
tee that would be a forum for all 
students to express their views, 
and the addition of transfer sena-
tors. 

"I think the transfer senator is 
a vital addition so that we can both 
represent and get transfer [stu-
dents] on A.S.," said task force 
chair and Thurgood Marshall 
College junior senator Kate 
Maull. "I think that che Open 
Committee can be implemented 
easily as long as we publicize and 
do some grassroots organizing 
and networking with student 
organizations, and if it doesn't 
work , then we end it." 

The report recommends that 
each college add one additional 
senator to represent transfer stu-
dents. Under the proposal, all leg-
islation would have to be submit-
ted in the open committee before 
being passed on ro the council. 

All-Campus Transfer 
Association President Chris Terry 
approved of the recommendation 
to add transfer senators. 

"I absolutely think that's a 
good way to represent [transfer 
students]." Terry said. "It's really 
hard ro get transfers on council. 
You're not here for [the first] two 
years, so when they go ro run for 
elections it's tougher because they 
don't have all the votes behind 
them." 

According to Terry, some of 
the issues for which transfer Stu-

dents could use the increased rep-
resentation include transfer sru-
dent admissions, transfer housing 
and the Intersegmental General 
Education Transfer Curriculum. 

The open committee, which 
would be open to any registered 
student, would vore on any pro-
posed legislation in order to pro-
vide an indicator of student sup-
port for each piece of legislation. 
According to the report, the open 
committee model could potential-
ly help improve the representation 
of org.mizations and members of 

" A.S. [Council] needs to 
better Support the 

members of these task 
farces with information, 

opinions and 
encouragement. " 

- Kate MIuII" chair, AS. T_ 
Force on Representation 

me srudent body who don't feel 
that the current A.S. struCture rep-
resents their interests. The open 
committee model is based on a 
system at the University of 
Wisconsin at Madison. 

Other proposals include the 
establishment of an enernal com-
minee and an academic affairs 
committee. The academic affairs 
committee woulcl' include eight 
representatives, each responsible 
for representing the interests of 
students in a particular field of 

study, such as social sciences or 
biology. The committee would 
then facilitate communication 
between UCSD and the other UC 
campuses. The internal commit-
tee and the proposed external 
committee would be changed to 
include eight members each, 
while the proposed finance com-
mittee would include six mem-
bers. ~ 

Potential models of represen-
tation rejected by the task force 
include a "Council of 
Organizations," which would 
include a vice president or com-
missioner of organizations and 
senators-at-Iarge, which would be 
elected cillTlpuswide and not as 
representatives of any college. 
According to the report, some 
members of the task force felt that 
senators-at-Iarge could concen-
trate power within a college or 
organization. 

According to Maull, several 
A.S. councilmembers are drafting 
legislation in relation to the effort, 
but as of yet there is no concerted 
effort to implement the recom-
mendations. 

"For the recommendations 
[the task force] proposes to be 
realistic ... future representational 
task forces should be chartered as 
ro acrually present a glimmer of 
hope that what they propose 
might someday become reality," 
Sixth College representative Arnit 
Mulgaonkar stated in his closing 
thoughts in the report. 

Maull cited the lack of support 
from the AS. Council during the 
process as the reason for the lack 
of implementation efforts.

Earl Warren College and Sixth 
College will be able to house all of 
their on-campus students in their 
colleges next year. Meanwhile, 
Eleanor Roosevelt College and 
Thurgood Marshall College will be 
able (Q house all their second-year 
and scholar srudents in the apart-
ments, but will have to continue to 
house some of their incoming 
freshmen in the Revelle College 
residence halls, according to the 
colleges' resident deans. John Muir 
College and Revelle College will 
have ro house some second-year 
srudents at other colleges, while 
housing all of their freshmen on 
their own campuses. 

According to ERC Resident 
Dean Reynaldo Guerrero , the 
number of residence hall spaces on 
the campus as a whole is enough to 
house the number of incoming 
freshmen in the university, a reason 
that did not justify the construction 
of even more residence halls in the 
new ERC complex. 

"We have enough spaces so that 
we can guarantee housing on cam-
pus," Guerrero said. "However, the 
problem is each college doesn't 
have the same number [for their 
srudents)." 

Muir and Revelle also face the 
similar situation of possibly having 
to house some of their second-year 
srudents in their residence halls due 
to their lack of adequate apartment 
space, according to their residence 
deans. 

"The residence halls are great, 
but living in arl on-campus apart-
ment allows srudents to progress in 
their personal development and self-
reliance," said Don Nghiem, the 

A.S. representative to the IlollsIng 
and Dining dviwry Comminec. "I 
am actually qUite concerned that 
continuing tudents from these col-
leges will nor be afforded the ~ame 
oppommity to grow and develop In 
the aparm1ents a tudents from 
other colleges." 

According to Revelle Re ident 
Dean Kevin Jones, Revelle hasn't 
had to house econd-year ~tudent~ 
in the residence hall. for the last 
five years. 

"ContinUing student generall)' 
don't want to live In the reSIdence 
halls because [apartment life] shows 
a en e of growth and maturity," 
Jones said. 

A cording to Jones, Re\'elle wlil 
be able to hou e 421 continuing 
students in the ,'.1atthews and 
Pepper Canyon apartment, send-
ing 20 studen into the Warren 
apartments and 60 tudem in the 
Revell re id nee hall . 

"Generally, all colleg have had 
the ability to tell their students up 
front what they can offer," Jones 
said. "However, Revelle and Muir 
are only abl to tell their tudent' 
where some places are on a 'we'll let 
you know when we know' basis." 

Some Revell fre hmen are 
upset wim the possibility tim they 
may have to continue hving III the 
residen e hall next year. 

"If I have to live m the reSIdence 
hall next year, I'm mOVIng off

Trinh aid. "They need to top

But what the holier-than-thou, "education-
is-sacred" protesters don't mention, or at least 
not often enough, is that the kid wasn't rrld/y 
trampled on by corporate desire, but was sus-
pended for an inconsiderate prank in defiance of 
a decent cause. On the day 

Naturally, if a school garnered funds by 
advertising some sort of illegal substance, or 
acceptj:(! donations for endorsing a controversial 
topic, then of course the funding would be high-
ly questionable. But it's unrealistic to make a 
blanket justification against accepting money 
from a corporation in exchange for advertising. 
As long as a sponsoring business restricts i~ 
demands to reasonable advertising, neither the 
school nor its srudents are hanned. To the con-
trary, education benefits from corporate spon-
sorship. 

Dan DeRose, a Colorado entrepreneur, has 
made a career of pitting corporations against 
each other to vie for advertising rights in public 
school districts. In 1997, he negotiated a $3 .4 
million contract between Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, 

Inc. and Texas' Grapevine-Colleyville 
Cameron made history as a sub-
versive sage, Coca-Cola execu-
tives were visiting his high 
school in Evans, Ga., to lecrure 
on economics and do other 
activi ties with students as a cuI-
lnination of a series of philan-

PRO 
School District. In'exchange for fund-
ing, Dr. Pepper advertisements 
adorned the school's rooftops. Whine 
all you want about conunercialization, 
but that's hardly amoral. 

Beverage companies have set a 
precedent for entering contracts in 
which they are the sole on-campus bev-
erage providers. This simply means 

thropic gestures. G reenbrier 
High was competing for a cash 
prize from the Coca-Cola Company and had 
organized a school photo with srudents spelling 
out the word "Coke." It was during that photo 
shoot that Cameron flashed his shirt. 

But even if Cameron, who later told the 
U:'nsbingtoll Post that. he just wanted to be an indi-
Vldual, -had an altruJ a c ano-corporate ideal, the 
school still would have been entirely justified in 
suspending him. Sure, Coca-Cola most likely 
wanted to make money and Coke in Education 
Day was one big publicity stunt. Nevertheless, 
the school benefi ned. 

Cameron made his move at an incredibly 
opportune point in history: public opinion was in 
his favor. Recent srudies, publications and com-
mercials (ironically enough) have warned that 
our consumer culture is beginning to control us, 
that consumers are too easily influenced by 
aJvertising, that they buy products because of an 
inability to see through some evil corporate 
scheme to take our money. In "Fast Food 
Nation," a long-time bestseller, Schlosser won 
over countless Americans by urging them to 
fight against the corporate world and all adver-
tising therein. 10 Schlosser and his compatriots, 
accepting funds from Coca-Cola on behalf of a 
school is equivalent to selling one's soul to the 
devil. 

that students purchase Pepsi instead of Coke 
from on-campus vending machines. Thanks to 
this new market, schools now earn nearly 530 
per child tmder such contracts, as opposed to less 
than a dollar when corporate sponsorship was an 
entirely novel concept. 

This practice could be taken too far, of 
course. But a srudent whose school's vending 
machines offer both Coke and Pepsi would not 
necessarily be bener-informed about consumer 
culture or decision-malcing. Nor would a srudent 
attending Qualcomm High School know less 
about presidential history than a srudent attend-
ing John F. Kennedy High School. 

Furthermore, schools rarely receive money 
entirely free of any agenda - political, commer-
cial or otherwise. Currently, public schools are 
funded largely by taxpayers' money, and it is 
those same taxpayers who vote on various propo-
sitions affecting public schools. Most public uni-
versities rely on donations from assorted alumni. 

So let a school be sponsored by Pepsi. Allow 
a Sony Middle School. There's no point in 
declining badly needed funding for unfounded, 
idealistic reasons. As long as the rights given to 
sponsors are limited to insignificant issues such 
as name, schools will gready benefit from the 
subsequent funding.

Any American with at least one func-
tioning eye can !W that we live in a highly 
competitive and commercial society. Every 
possible oudet I\as been completely devel-
oped for advertising purposes. MCl!>1: maga-
zines are a highly concentrated collection 
of targeted advertisements, and it seems as 
if many television shows exist primarily to 
justify advertising slots during the program 
and to sell DVD box sets or other product 
tie-ins. Public buildings and buses dot the 
landscape with colorful posters. 
Advertising is so pervasive that it is no 
longer necessary to mention a product; the 
mere brand is as effective as a full-on prod-
uct pitch. 

'This is why corporate sponsorships of 
public institutions have been so successful . 
With only name recognition necessary, no 
place or event is too large or too small to 
don a brand - for a suitable price, of 
course. That is, except for two traditional 
hold-outs in the American corporate arena 
- religion and education. With their 
emphasis on more important and grave 
issues, this makes a lot of sense. These 
kinds of instirutions avoid distractions such 
as soft drink preference 
when discussing the infi-

to slavery 
to "Channel One" were suspended from 
school, or worse yet, many children did not 
want to do anything during the school day 
other than watch "Channel One." 

Education's purpose is to prepare stu-
dents to face the world. Granted, learning 
to ignore advertising is a very important 
part of facing the modem world, but when 
srudents are punished for exercising their 
right not to aclmowledge advertising, they 
have lost the ability and free will to make 
their own choices. Even if the intended 
acclimation to advertising is not complete-
ly realized, the students will still be dis-
couraged from making their own decisions. 
Mer all , these decision-making skills are 
encouraged during school, but how impor-
tant can this education be if the rights to 
name the school are given to the highest 
bidder on eBay, as in the case of Alice 
Costello School in New Jersey? 

Obviously, not every case of corJXlrate 
sponsorship in schools ends up like the 
"Channel One" crisis. But putting a com-
panys name on an object is still advertising, 
and still carries s">me of the same negative 
effectS, regardless of whether the srudents 
are forced to pay attention. 

Once a company has paid for its name 

nite. 
Over the last decade, 

however, education fund-
ing has been lagging and 
schools are selling out to 
advertisers in greater num-

to be associated with the public image of a 
facility, it tends to protect its 
invesonent. This undoubtedly 
translates into a loss of creative 
freedom. Even if the sponsoring 
company has not set up rules for 
how a school should be run, the 
schools are constrained nonethe-

(ON 
bers. Of course, this is 
because public schools are 
funded by tax money. As politicians try to 
build short-term favor with voters by offer-
ing tax cuts, the pool of money used to fund 
the operation and construction of schools 
gets smaller. Schools are forced to turn to 
alternative funding sources, which usually 
means that advertising is given free rein 
over the one place where children are legal-
ly required to go. 

One of the most heavily publicized hor-
ror stories of advertising in schools across 
the country involved "Channel One," a 
mandatory 12-minute television program 
shown in over 12,000 elementary schonls. 
The program was a cross between the shon 
ABC newsreds seen on transadantic Bights 
and the hideous College Television 
Network which airs constandy at Sierra 
Summit. One-sixth of the "Cllannel One" 
program was advertising: These critical 
two minutes paid for the televisions, satel-
lite dishes and their installation. The catch 
was that the children had to watch the 
"Channel One" programming - commer-
cials and all- or the schools couldn't keep 
the televisions and the deal was off. Within 
a few weeIcs, the system fell into pandem0-
nium. Rebels who refused to pay attention 

less: The mere threat of pullinI!' 
financial support gives a company 
control over the school. 

Don't believe that a large corporation 
capable of sponsoring a school would not 
exploit its position. The purpose of a cor-
poration is to maximize profit, which often 
puts it at odds with the ethical standards of 
that which it is sponsoring. For example, 
during the San Diego wildfires, while thou-
sands of San Diegans took to the streets to 
vohUlteer and help, the vendors of the 
enetgy beverage "Red Bull" saw these 
crowds as yet another captive audience. 
They sent roving bands of cheerleaders to 
give out "Red Bull," generally irritating the 
philanthropic crowds, hawlcing what they 
deemed "The official energy beverage of 
Firestorm 2003!" It is easy to see how tlus 
type of disregard for anything but gross 
profit could cause problems when mated 
with an institute of learning. 

Despite the manipulations of several 
corporations, a suitable alternative exiSb at 
UCSD, with all of the benefits of increased 
funding that corporate sponsorship affords

RIMAe, Earl's Place battle for our unhealthy souls 
Aftertaste 

Evelyn Hsieh 

An unexpected test of resis-tance awaited me when I came home one night. As 
soon as I stepped into my apart-
ment, every olfactory sense went 
on high alert, k.ind of IiIce how 
Spiderman immediately senses 
danger. Instead of henchmen and 
hobgoblins, though, I encountered 
deep-fried tofu and Korean beef. 
The air was thick with aromas of 
oil and marinade, and my mind 
and body quickly fell subordinate 
to my nose as I fotmd myself drift-
ing toward the kitchen. My apart-
ment-mate was malcing dinner for 
the next night and the counter was 
replete with culinary goodies. I 
had to swiftly hightail it to my 
room and shut the door, lest I suc-
cumb to the temptation of sruffing 
my bee at II p.m. 

It is this same primal instinct 
and speedy seduction that drives 
millions of Americans to indulge. 
The smell, the accessibility and the 
impulse of eating, combined with 
the ease of inactivity, form the 
basis of the new scapegoatlbuu-

word/epidemic - obesity. When 
the Center for Disease Control 
recendy reported that obesity 
would soon 0Yertllke smoking as 
the leading preventable cause of 
death, even more warning bells 
(and cash registers) SWted ring-
ing. Being overweight or obese 
spawns a wide range of conditions 
and diseases, from chronic coach-
potato syndrome and food coma 
to diabetes and heart &ilure. Any 
argument about feeling good 
about oneself, regardless of 
weight, is eclipsed by sheer con-
cern for one's health. 

According to the CDC, adults 
aged SO to 59 have the highest per-
centage of overweight and obese 
people, with 26 percent of that 
group in 2001 falling into the cat-
egory. College-age students, how-
ever, stand at a unique juncture in 
their lives, having the most control 
to direct the course of their health 
and well-being more than any 
other age group. We are old 
enough to malc:e informed deci-
sions about our lifestyles, yet we 
are young enough to easily begin 
and maintain healthy habits. 

My childhood was certainly not 
conducive to dietary health. I 
remember eating Dunlceroos 
almost every day - kangaroo-
shaped cookies to be dunked in 
.frost;"g of all things. Back in the 
'90s, the words "carbohydrate" 

and "simple sugars" were confined 
to nutrition manuals and biology 
tezts. 

My high school cafeteria's 
most popular items were pizza, 
cheese bread, spicy fries and 
chocolate malts. I never really ate 
there, but would help myself to my 
friends' fries while they dranlc 
their 2G-ounce Cherry Cokes. 

Even in college, I attempted to 
eat "healthy" by ordering a taco 
salad from Plaza Cafe, laden with 
nutrient ·deficient lettuce and bay 
meat in a deep-fried shell. Only 
after I read extensively on nutri-
tion and exercise did I understand 
the fundamentals of healthy living. 

I was fortunate to have parents 
who cooked healthy Asian meals 
(canceling out the Dunlc.aroos) 
and enrolled me in swim classes. 
Only in college have I truly 
appreciated the mandated hour of 
physical education from my past. 
In college, no one is left to appor-
tion vegetables or enforce exer-
cise. We are left in the jungle of a 
million choices; the Freshman IS 
is JUSt one indicator of our new-
found freedom and confusion. 

Now is the best time to chart 
the route of health for the rest of 
our lives. As young adults, we can 
exploit our youth and get away 
with it. Or we can take advantage 
of our vigor, liberty and fast 
metabolism to make healthy 

choices. \\'hen else can we live off 
of four hours of sleep and maIce 
Earl's Place runs for Chips Ahoy at 
midnight? At the same time, when 
do we have RIMAC at our dispos-
al and lots of free time to both 
work out and experiment with 
healthy coolc.ing? 

After graduation, most of our 
jobs will require 40 hours a week of 
sitting and typing. Spouses and kids 
will !X'ing extra joy, but also extra 
stresS. Our metabolisms will slow 
and our energy will decrease. This 
sounds fatalistic, but it merely 
points our the many advantages that 
we young adults have. 

An arsenal of important infor-
mation on healthy living is lost 
amidst the sometimes-misleading 
marketing of diets and products. 
Diet boolc.s top the bestseller lists. 
Every aisle in grocery stores, 
from Trader Joe 's to Albertson's, 
is packed with low-carb products. 
It is saddening, almost pathetic, 
to see the American public so 
quickly embrace gimmiclc.s and 
fast solutions to a serious and 
long-term problem. 

Instead of understanding that 
God did not origimlly create 
partially-hydrogenated oil and 
MSG, people flock to the gospel 
of Dr. Phil and Robert Adcins. 
While a general awareness of eat-
ing well and living healthy is 
commendable, the simple facts of 

consuming less and exercising 
more is somewhat diluted. 

A paradigm shift is in order -
a country in which two million 
people dine at McDonalds every 
day can't expect to forever al ter 
its health in a 4O-day diet. That 
being said, McDonald's is coming 
up with "healthier" meals by 
eliminating SuperSize options 
and introducing apple and 
caramel dippers. Just as caramel 
is a concession to our over-
whelming desire for sinful indul-
gence, McDonald's probably is 
only conceding because of con-
sumer demand rather than con-
sumer health. If consumers actu-
ally filter through all the health 
news and trends, they'll see that it 
all comes down to consuming 
fewer calories and exercising 
more, dippers or no dippers, 
carbs or no carbs. 

Twenty-year-old college stu-
dents - or people of any age -
don't have to stop eating their 
beloved burgers, garl ic bread or 
chocolate mousse. Moderation 
and awareness are crucial, and as 
both students and humans during 
the prime of our lives, we can 
effectively live this credo starting 
today.

UCSD students served as men-

"Volunteers always have high

addressing the audience wim a

She began by sharing the

up to her eventual career as a sci-

her by her mother of a bird that 
reaches the highest heights by 
hiding in the feathers of an eagle 
as he soars high, and then when 
the eagle has tired, flies above 
him, flying to the highest heights. 

"I love symbols." she said. 
"And to me, this is symbolic. If we

always fly a little bit higher, to 
always be reaching for a goal that's 
beyond our reach, how high can 
any of us fly on 
our own?"

grams seek to make changes all

areas. 

"One of the worst problems we 
face is our own apathy," Goodall 
said. 

Her Take Care program works 
to help native Africans understand 
their relationships with the land 
and with chimpanzees. It also 
helps to start to rebuild areas of

destroyed. 

She also dis-
cussed the Roots 
& Shoots pro-
gram, which 
involves youth 
from all over the 
world . Goodall 
said she started 
this program after 
talking with young 
people who were 
feeling hopeless 
and discouraged. 
The program 
works with youth 
on a variety of 
projects that all 
work for to bellefit 
society. Goodall 
says she finds hope 

And most of US do. " 
entist Louis 
Leakey, who 
would become her 

- Jane GoocIaI, 
Nierenberz Prize for 
SdencelnthePublc 

Interest recipient 
mentor. 

She had no college degree, but 
Leakey sent her into the field to 
study the chimpanzees. It was not 
until after her landmark discovery 
that chimpanzees used tools, a 
trait formerly attributed only to 
humans, that she went back to 
school. She went to Cambridge 
University, where she received her 
doctorate without ever receiving a 
lower degree. Goodall character-
ized her experience at the univer-
sity as the point where she learned 
that everything she had been 
doing was being done in the 
wrong manner. One of these 
faults was attributing human char-
acteristics to the chimpanzees, as 
she always did then and sti II does 
today. She linked the ancestry of 
the human and the chimpanzee 
during her speech, relating the 
two creature~ both to a common 
ancestor and to each other today. 

"If you look around the world, 
you really can't deny that we have 
some innate aggressive tenden-
cies," Goodall said. "And we do 
show them in the same kind of 
context as the chimpanzee. But at 
the same time, we equally have 
inherited from our distant pri-
mate past characteristics of love, 
compassion and altrui ~m." 

Goodall exprsesed her admira-
ton of the human brain and the 
qualities it imparts on human 
beings. 

"We have an extraordinary 
brain, which I believe is more 
capable than that of any other 
creature in controlling our innate 
biological behaviors," Goodall 
said. "So each one of us can imag-
ine having the good and the bad, 
the dark and the kind, and it is up 
to each one of us to develop the 

in the energy and determination 
of children and the indomitable 
spi ri t she ca n see in every htl man . 

"Young people are malung a 
difference," Goodall said. "They 
are changing the world. Every 
individual makes a difference 
every day. " 

Goodall also touched on polit-
ical issues, especially those of the 
events of 9/11, and the war in 
Iraq. She said that after 9/11, peo-
ple asked her how she coul4 retain 
hope for the future . Her answer 
was that although on that dny she 
saw the worst of all evil. she also 
saw the greatest of heroism. In 
regards to this and the war in Iraq, 
she told a story of watching the 
migration of the cranes along the 
Platte River in Colorado. On thi~ 
occasion, 12 million cranes gath-
ered on the river. She said that she 
felt that the cranes brought a mes-
sage of hope. This message came 
not only from the dance of the 
cranes, but also from the fact that, 
although the Platte River is envi-
ronmentally endangered, it can 
still hold 12 million cranes. 

Goodall ended her speech with 
this message of hope and 
reminders to the audience to do 
what they can to make changes in 
their lives . These included buying 
hybrid cars and non-genetically 
modified foods. She finished by 
reminding the audience to vote. 

Her speech was followed by a 
question-and-answer session with 
audience members. The questions 
spanned topics from the brain of 
the human and chimpanzee to the 
use of chimpanzees in labs and 
how people can research which 
companies arc environmentally 
friendly.

MCloIDAY. MAY 3. 2004 THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Warren: Fee will generate $50,000 in funds 
conlillllA!d from page I 

to ensure that students voted only 
once. 

However, the number of ballots 
reviewed by Warren election offi-
cials exceeded the number of 
recorded voters by one, a number 
Warren Special Election Manager 
Max Kuperman said was within a 
reasonable margin of error. 

"I highly doubt that any student 
voted twice," Kuperman said. 
"[One extra vote1 is very good for 
an election. Especially in a paper 
election, mere is bound to be some 
different numbers. We were very 
accurate and the poll workers did a 
great job." 

The 30 poll workers needed to 
run the voting si tes were "very 
well trained," he said, explaining 
that the discrepancy in numbers 
likely resulted from a voter whose 
name was not recorded by the 
workers. 

Participating voters entered 
into a raftle to win sets of tickets to 
Chargers and Padres sporting 
events, provided by USA TodiJy, and 
received a coffee mug with the 
paper's logo. 

In total, the newspaper provid-
ed approximately $2,000 in fund-
ing and materials to promote me 
special election, according to out-
going WCSC President Tim 
Alexander. 

USA Touy is one of mree 
newspapers delivered through me 
Warren Readership Program, a 
S9,OOO-per-year service currendy 
paid for by the college'S adminis-
trators, according to Alexander. 
However, because of budget cuts, 
the program may 'potentially end 
if me college council does not 
take over its funding in the fall of 

2004. 
"I'm not a super-strong advo-

cat" of this [program)," Ward said, 
addillg that spending by the col-
lege was up to me studerat council 
and that me council made no 
agreement with USA Tod4y in 
exchange ~or me paper's assistance 
in me wGet out and vote" cam-
paign. 

Ward said he would support 
using a portion of me more than 
$SO,OOO to be raised through the 
activity fee to continue the college's 
subscription wim the lAs Angeles 

" Warren is baring. 
Twelve dollars isn't that 

much-it'sa 
small price to pay. "

Tmus and would ramer have stu-
dents decide through a survey if 
mey wanted other newspapers 
included. 

A "fat chunk of me money" 
will go to the Warren Transfer 
and Commuter Commission, 
according to Ward. The commit-
tee was created when WarreD stu-
dents ratified a new constitution 
in April. According to Ward, me 
committee will focus its funding 
on programs targeted at com-
muters, while me student council 
will aim at me on-campus resi-
dents. 

"A big priority is making sure 
that they have a good time while 
they're here, so in two years they'll 
want to come back," Ward said, 
explaining that his goals include 
putting on a major campuswide 
event to be sponsored by me col-
lege. 

According to Warren freshman 
Leo Bondar, the prospect of more 
activities was the reason he voted in 
favor of the fee. 

"Warren is boring," Bondar 
said. "Twelve dollars isn't that 
much - it's a small price to pay." 

In addition to college events, 
Ward said he would also like to see 
the council prO'.nde services for res-
idents, including installing Triton 
Plus readers on the college's laun-
dry equipment. However, he said 
all major spending will wait until 
next year. 

"We just have a fiscal responsi-
bility. Now mat we have the 
money, we need to take care of it," 
Ward said, promising r.hat me col-
lege wil! not dip into the funds 
early, which would calise me cur-
rent year to end in a deficit. 

However, Watren sophomore 
Bryan Phan said he opposes me fee 
increase, uplaioing that he had tit-
de interest in me proposals. 

Before me student fee is 
imposed, the referendwn must be 
certified by Warren administrators 
and receive approval from universi-
ty officials and me UC president, 
according to Alexander. 

Alexander said he expects offi-
cials to implement the fee without 
problems and believes the money 
will be beneficial for the college. 

"I think we can definitely expect 
great things from [the council] next 
year," he said. 

Black studies: Marshall student council 
'. 

also passes resolution in support of program 
coruinutd from ~ r 

history of Thurgood Marshall 
College and also found that mere 
was a huge interest in starting the 
program. 

"I mought. keeping history in 
mind, that it would be a great pro-
gram," Silva said. "It's a shame that 
there is a great Latin American 
Studies program, but the university 
doesn't extend me same intersec-
tion of cultures and politics on 
campus with a black studies pro-
gram." 

During the council's April 28 
meeting, A.S. Student Affirmative 
Action Coalition representative 
Daniel Gonzales urged the coun-
cil to table the resolution for one 
more week. Gonzales said that 
members of the Black Student 
Union would like to see the reso-
lution first before it passes in 
council. 

"I chinle that there's a process 
that we go through when council 
takes up an effort to support a com-
munity," Gonzales said. '!I thinle 
that mere's a process that needs to 
be respected." 

According to Gonzales, the 
BSU has been working on estab-
lishing a black studies program, but 
that me group was not given the 
opportunity to provide input in the 
resolution. 

"I'm disappointed that the 
counci 1 didn't realize tha t mere 
shouldn't have been a written reso-
lution without speaking to me 
community first," Gonzales said. 
"It showed a lot of ego on [the 
council's] pan and made it about 
themselves, rather than making the 
resolution about the community 
and stu~ents." 

Silva said during the April 28 
council meeting that he had talked 
to faculty and staff in regards to the 
resolution and tried to contact a 
BSU representative. Silva said that 
he was disappointed that mere 
were objections to passing me res-
olution on April 28. 

"That was :I difficult debate, and 
we didn't know whether to pass it 
or hold off on it," Silva said. "It's 
sad to see mat something that was 
supposed to unify people divided 
them." 

Chris Sweeten, a BSU mem-
ber, was also present during the 
council meeting and urged the 
council to table me legislation 
until members of the BSU could 
give input during its meeting on 
May 3. 

" What's important is that 
students came together ... 

and try to establish this 
program on campus. " 
-lhMs Silva, ~ chIir, 

~~rae 
"I feel that if you really want 

the resolution to pass, then you 
should look at the members of the 
community that it actually effects 
and not just staff members," 
Sweeten said during the council's 
April 28 meeting. "You need to 
look at the students because if this 
is passed, then there's probably 
going to be a committee mat will 
be brought to the floor and these 
students are me ones who are 
probably going to fill me spots in a 
committee. " 

With me resolution passed, 
Silw said mat the important next 
step is to have students work 
togemer on the issue to make sure 
that a program is established. 

"What's important is that stu-
dents come togemer, whoever they 
are and whatever their academic 
pursuit is, and try to establish this 
program on campus," Silva said. 

According to Silva, another ini-

tial step in the process of establish-
ing the program includes speaking 
to faculty members. 

"[MarshalI1 student council is 
intending to talk to faculty mem-
bers associated with the program 
and faculty who are pushing it for-
ward," Silva said. "Now that we've 
identified that mere are students 
behind it, we need to identify what 
elements in the faculty would need 
to support it. We also need to reach 
out to other members of communi-
ty, work with omer groups repre-
senting black communities, and 
work with professors." 

According to outgoing A.S. 
Vice President of Academic Affairs 
Todd Tolin, creating a black stud-
ies minor is feasible and would 
need to be generated by faculty 
members who are willing to teach 
classes that are focused on this one 
topic. 

"I believe mat this has been in 
the works for 30 years and there 
are courses that would work in this 
program," Tolin said. "They just 
need to find faculty that would 
commit to teaching those classes 
and put togemer a specific focus 
fur me program." 

Once a department that is will-
ing to house me minor is found, 
the next step would be to draft the 
main goal of me program and 
select me specific courses mat stu-
dents can take. The draft would 
need to be approved by the 
Academic Senate and by the 
UCSD administration. 

"In my discussion wim the 
administration, it seems everyone 
is behind [a black studies pro-
gram]," Tolin said. "There's just a 
resource problem - having faculty 
say 'yes' and draw a whole program 
is where 1 think they've hit a 
stalling point. " 

Tolin said mat the next step is 
for students to take the resolution, 
show f1Icu1ty members that there is 
suppon for the program, and ask 
them for their commitment.

10 FEATURES THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Students pick from caffeine choices 
Coffee can be found across the campus 

By HANS FELLMAN 
Contributing Writer 

During midterms week, just 
about everyone on campus could 
use a good jolt of caffeine to get 
going in the morning. While find-
ing a plai n cup of black coffee and 
a doughnut is not hard , many sru-
dents prefer sipping a caramel 
macchiato with a blueberry scone 
or a lane with a fudge brownie in 
a relaxed environment conducive 
to srudying. For those who are 
choosy about coffee or just sick of 
the same old cup of joe, there are 
plenty of options on campus, each 
with its own distinct specialties 
and atmosphere. 

Espresso Roma, nicknamed 
" Roma" for regulars, is located in 
Price Center and has a study-
friendly environment. Roma is 
best known among students for 
Its r:ualiry lanes, cappuccinos and 
mochas. 

"J come to Roma almo t every 
day for a mocha," Yuvraj Agarwal, 
a graduate student, said. "It keeps 
me going." 

Espresso Roma also offers a 
wide se lection of six different 
sugar-free flavor syrups: raspberry, 
hazelnut, caramel, vanilJa, Irish 
cream and mint. For side items, 
customers choose from croissants, 
10 types of doughnuts, brownies, 
scones, sandwiches and muffins. 

If you're in a hurry, Peabody's 
Coffee Cart, conveniently locat-
ed at various Spots throughout 
campus, is the place. Its fast, 
friendly service and concise selec-

tion of coffees gets you In and our the whole campus. There are over 
and on your way to Ill.idterms as 30 flavors of Torani's coffee syrup 
quickly as possible, The carts are to choose from, and combinations 
located at Center Hall, Warren of each can be made upon request. 
Mall , RIMAC and Social Also popular are caramel and 
Sciences Building. vanilla lattes, which can be paired 

"[ love Peabody's location with pumpkin bread or apple 
because [ can grab a cup of coffee . crumb muffin. 
and still make it to class on time," In Student Cemer, Grove 
Ajay Punjabi, an Earl Warren Caffe is the place to go for coffee. 
College senior, said. "I'm all about the Grove because 

Its signature coffee drink, the it's got great mochas, lattes and 
White Rhino, is a white chocolate single-shot espressos and the 

" I carne to Rama almost 
ev~ day for a mocha. It 

keeps me going. II

graduate sludent 

mocha blended with ice and milk. 
Peabody's blueberry scones are 
also highly regarded by frequent 
customers. 

For sun gods looking to catch 
some rays and a coffee, Java Coast 
Coffee Cart, located outdoors 
next to Club Med restaurant at the 
School of Medicine is the place to 
go. Popular items include java 
mochas, vanilla or hazelnut coffee, 
chocolate chip cookie and lemon 
scones. 

Muir Woods Coffee House, at 
John Muir College, offers one of 
the best selections of coffees on 

Lori DrahotaiGuatdlOn 

atmosphere is relaxed and social," 
Andrew Klein, an Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior, said. 
"The cookies and chocolate crois-
sants are also good," 

As far as atmosphere and vari-
ety of coffee are concerned, Art of 
Espresso tops them all. This cof-
fee stand is located between 
Mandeville Auditorium and 
Porter's Pub, on a beautiful grassy 
moll under the shade of eucal yp-
rus trees. Fearured coffees include 
the organic Sumatra Drip, the 
Blended Bliss and · blended 
mochas. The Spun Monkey, cof-
fee with chocolate or spices blend-
ed together with ice and a fresh 
banana, sells well. The most 
sought-after side item is a deca-
dent white chocolate raspberry 
bar. 

Whether you're hurrying to a 
midterm or loolcing for a place to 
srudy and sip some java, there's 
always nearby coffee on campus. 
Each place has its own specialties 
and aLnosphere, so L::eep your eyes 
peeled and be willing to tty some-
thing new.

Chips: Spring Poker Classic 
tournament to be held in May 

ally .".,GuaIdan 
PoUr fa: WliIe poker irMlM!s some krl, strategies can be learned through 
practice. UCSD Poker Society membets play regularly 10 help hone their skills. 

continued from page 9 
unable to see their cards. For stu-
dents who are under 21 or would 
rather not drive hours to Las 
Vegas, online tournaments allow 
anyone over 18 to play in the com-
fort of his or her home. Though 
Websites offer a variety of poker 
games, Fu sticks to Texas Hold'em. 

"There are usually like 20,000 
people playing at one time," Fu 
said. "There is a ton of money out 
there to be won." 

And win money is exacdy what 
Fu did, He placed seventh in a 
smaller satellite tournament earlier 
this year, which won him a free seat 
in the Million Dollar tournament. 

The Million Dollar tournament 
staned with 2,000 players and the 
top winner was guaranteed at least 
$1 million. The contestants are at 
one of many tables of 10 players, 
which dwindle in participants 
throughout the rounds until only 
one table is left. Fu placed sixth 
overall and took home $50,000 in 
winnings. 

"You have to be a little lucky to 
get that far," Fu said. "But you've got 
to Imow when to pick your spots." 

Surprisingly, Fu is new to the 
game. 

"I just started playing this 
school year," he said. "A bunch of 
guys from Marshall got together, so 
I played and started learning. It's a 
great game." 

Fu will not be sporting gold 
watches any time soon though _ . 
he intends to invest the money to 
pay for college. 

"I'm more levelheaded," he said. 
"I don't want to get anything fancy." 

Texas Hold'em is different from 
traditional poker in that each play-
er is dealt only two cards and five 
community cards are placed in the 
center of the table. The first three 
cards are dealt to the center, which 
is called the Bop. Mter a round of 
betting, the fourth card - the turn 
- is placed. Another round of bet-
ting brings the fifth card, which is 
called the river. The players are 
allowed one more round of betting 
before they must show their cards. 
The winning hand is the best com-
bination of five cards on the table. 
In the rare case that the five cards 

showing on the table make the best 
combination, the remaining players 
split the pot. 

The rules are simple, but the 
finer nuances of the game are diffi-
cult to master. 

"Learning to play winning 
Tens HoId'em requires reading 
and studying," Bill Burton, author 
of "Get the Edge at Low Limit 
Texas Hold'em" said. "If you read 
just one book about the game, you 
will be ahead of about 80 percent of 
the other payers at the table. 
Spending the money for a good 
poker book is a lot cheaper than 
trying to get your education at the 
tables in a live game." 

But for a little real-world prac-
tice, the UCSD Poker. Society is 
hosting the Spring Poker Classic 
on May 23 . The event will feature a 
no-limit Texas Hold'em tourna-
ment in which everyone will 
receive the same number of chips 
to start. Tickets are $20 a t the 
UCS D box office and the tourna-
ment will be held at Viejas Ca,ino,

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Softball woes continue as team goes 1-3 
Season ends as Tritons are swept in tw'o-game series by SFSU 

By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD's softball team had a 
rocky weekend ro close our its reg-
ular season, splining a pair of 
games on April 30 with California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
foe Sonoma State and dropping 
two games at San Francisco State. 

The Tritons' weekend looked 
like it was off to a great start, as 
they took the first of two games 
from Sonoma State by a score of 
3-2. Though the Seawolves 
jumped to a 2-0 lead in the fourth, 
Tritons freshman starting pitcher 
Tina Rowe held on through sev('n 
innings as her team battled back 
for three runs, improving her 
2004 record to 12-7. 

UCSD's three-run rally took 
, off in the sixth inning, sparked by 

a single from sophomore center 
fielder Jenny Spencer. Sophomore 
shortstop Desiree F ranciscus then 
walked, etting the stage for the 
CCANs leading hitter, senior sec-
ond baseman Kim Aggabao, who 
singled, scoring Spencer. Junior 
catcher Jamie Hurst's single 
brought home both Franciscus 
and Aggabao, who had been 
moved over by a sacrifi ce bunt 
from senior first baseman Jodie 
Bland, bringing in the eventual 
winning run for the Tritons. 

What had looked like a good 
start to the weekend for UCSD 
quickly turned into a repeat of the 
18th Annual Cal State Bakersfield 
Mountain Dew Classic, played 
April 23 through April 25, which 
was plagued by a rash of one-run 
losses. Lacking enough run sup-
port, starti ng pitcher Bland lost 
the game, 2- 1, dropping her 
record to 13-12. 

Junior left fielder Breanne 
Cope started off the seventh 
inning, down 1-0, with a wa lk. 
Senior third baseman Am)' Mcnee 
then sacrificed Cope to second, 
which allowed her to score off a 
double by Spencer. Spencer 
attempted to extend her double to 
a triple and \Vas thrown out. 
UCSD couldn't get the offensive 
fire started again, despite

he crossed the line by di smissi ng 
Tillman's individual heroism. 
Rather, shouldn't readers be ask-
ing what makes Tillman more 
heroic than other fallen service-
men' The article deserves every 
bit of the criticism that it has gen-
erated, but much of that condem-
nation is misguided. 

Those who caught any of the 
media frenzy surrounding 
Tillman 's death were undoubtedly 
informed immediately that 
Tillman turned down a $3 .6-mil-
lion contract with the Cardinals to 
join the Army. Why does his sacri-
ficed sa lary come up so fast in the 
discussion of his death' Clearly, as 
a fallen professional sports icon, 
he attracts more press than other, 
less renowned soldiers who don't 
rerurn home alive, but is that the 
onJy reason' 

It feels like the media emphasis 
011 Tillman 's decision to forgo a 
multimi llion dolla r contract in 
favor of military service is the 
qualifier for being a greater hero 
than any of the other hundreds of 
I\merican dead since 9/11, and 
this is wrong. 

When T:lIman opted to take 
off the Cardinals helmet in favor 
of the Army Ranger uniform, he 
stated that he wished to be treated 
equally with every other Army 
Ranger. Until his death, this 
request was honored. 

Now, the Army has promoted 
Tillman posthumously from cor-

poral to specialist: Under normal 
ci rcumstances, military promo-
tions are not awarded for achieve-
ments or actions, but because the 
person being promoted displays 
promise of improving as a soldier. 
Apparently, lillman's case is dif-
ferent, despite his request at the 
onset of his military career. 

Of course, it wouldn't be in the 
American spirit to imply that any 
soldier returning from war is not a 
hero, but TIllman .continues to be 
the subject of much more national 
attention than any other soldier 
coming home. 

What about the guy who left his 
job making $50,000 a year and his 
family, only to suffer the same fate? 
I haven't heard as much about him, 
or any other deceased soldier. 

The positive side of the cover-
age surrounding Tillman's demise 
is that people can finally put a 
name and a face that they recog-
nize with the idea of American 
dead overseas. Hearing about a 
group of soldiers who perished in 
battle has become an all-too-
familiar aspect of the daily news, 
it seems, but the coverage limits 
our understanding of the lives 
being lost to military file photos 
and a name. There is no mention 
of what these people's lives were 
like outside of the military. The 
result is a definite detachment 
from the reality of war and the 
loss of life. To this day, the media 
is reluctant to shed light on the 
total number of Americans whose 

lives were lost in Afghanistan. 
Rarely does the public hear any-
thing besides the relatively low 
numbers of daily or weekly casu-
alties. What about the more than 
740 fallen Americans in Iraq? 
Why do their lives not receive the 
same attention or grief that 
TIllman's has generated? 

There is a tragic double stan-
dard that America ignores every 
day. Would the country feel the 
same way about war if each man 
and woman that perished while 
serving the country received as 
much attention as Tillman? If 
news networlcs dedicated entire, 
hour-long time slots to vigils for 
each soldier, and if eBay began 
advertising the sale of those peo-
ple's belongings and memorabilia, 
what would be the effect? 

TIllman is a hero, but he is no 
greater than any of the other 
American soldiers whose h"es 
were sacrificed in the line of duty 
while avenging the anaclcs of 9/ 1 i. 
U-Mass-Amherst Daily Collegian 
columnist Gonzalez overstepped 
the bounds of his argument by 
rejecting TIllman's heroism, but it 
might serve the rest of America 
well to observe the imbalance of 
reporting over his death. Tillman's 
is a face that can finally be put to 
all of the names of soldiers who 
won't come home from battle, but 
his role in the military remains 
limited to that of an Army Ranger, 
regardless of his domestic athletic 
fame.

Baseball: Hernandez breaks hits record 
continued from page ,6 

on a single by freshman catcher 
David Morehead. Langone knot-
ted the game when sophomore 
left fielder David Gomez ground-
ed into a double play. 

The game was tied at the com-
pletion of the scheduled seven 
innings when, after a one-out 
walk to Hernandez, Riddle hit a 
line-drive, two-run home run just 
inside the right-field foul pole. It 
was his fifth of the season, which 
ties him for the team lead. Junior 
reliever Shlomo Lipetz shut the 
door on the Warriors in the bot-
tom half of the inning, retiring the 
side in order on three ground 
balls. Lipetz earned the win in a 
hugely effective relief perfor-

mance, improving to a still-per-
fect 5-0. He replaced sophomore 
staner Byron Grubman with one 
out in the third inning and 
allowed just three hits and one run 
while striking out a pair over five 
and two-thirds innings of work. 

Bunon finished 3-for-5 with 
two runs scored and three driven 
in. Among his three hits, he had a 
double and his first home run of 
the year, a two-run shot in the 
third inning to put the Tritons on 
the board after Cal State 
Stanislaus jumped out to an early 
5-0 advantage with two runs 
scored in the first inning and 
three more in the second. Over 
his last seven games, Burton's bat-
ting average is .552 (16-29) and he 

has posted four doubles, two 
triples and a home run. Riddle was 
2-for-5, also with a double and a 
home run, a run scored and three 
RBI. Robinson, Morehead and 
junior second baseman Ricky 
Pinocchio produced two hits 
apiece, with Pinocchio scoring 
twice. UCSD out-hit the 
Warriors 14-11 in the game. 

The Tritons finished with the 
fifth-best record in the CeM, but 
qualify for the playoffs because 
No.1 UC Davis is ineligible due to 
its pending move from Division II 
to Division l. Sonoma State earned 
the top playoff spot, second in con-
ference, followed by Chico. State 
and Cal State San Bernardino, 
respectively. 

Softball: Softball ends 2004 with 29 .. 27 record 
continued from page 1 4 

sophomore right fielder Niki 
Anderson all went 2-for-3 in the 
game. 

May 1 began with another one-
run loss for UCSD, by a score of 3-
2 against San Francisco State. 
Freshman starter Rowe was unable 
to reproduce her performance from 
the day before, bringing her record 
down to 12-8 with the loss. 

The Tritons jumped out to an 
early lead in the first inning, ben-
efiting from an RBI double from 
Aggabao, who leads the CCAA in 
doubles. Bland then tacked on the 
second run in the third, with an 
RBI doublt of her own. However, 
the Gators gOt one run in the sixth 
inning and were able to bring in 
two more runs in the seventh 
inning to take the lead and victo-
ry. 

If there was a silver lining to 
UCSD's 3-1 loss in the second 
game on May I, it was that it didn't 
extend to the bonom of the seventh 
inning. Starting pitcher Bland 
ended the regular season with a 13-
13 record after taking the loss. 

The Tritons once again scored 
early, as J:ranciscus singled in

Spencer, who had tripled, in the 
first inning. Unforrunately, this was 
all the scoring UCSD could 
muster, and it could not hold up 
against San Francisco State's three-
run home run in the fourth inning, 
putting the Gators ahead once and 
for all. Aggabao finished 1-for-3, 
bringing her batting average up to 
an amazing .411, the second-high-

est in UCSD history, behind Erin 
Bridges' .415 in 2000. 

The Tritons now wait on the 
final NCAA West Regional Poll to 
see if they advance to the playoffs. 
UCSD was ranked eighth going 
into the weekend. Only the top six 
teams advance and it is unlikely 
that they will be granted a playoff 
berth in light of the recent losses.

Tritons blank Grand canyon at NCAA Regionals 
Women's tennis heads to Hawaii for bid at Nationals 

Virtually unstoppable: The Tritons women's tennis team rolled over Grand Canyon on May \, sweeping their opponent in 
SIX Slrillght sets. UCSD Will face Hawali-Hilo May 7 for an opportunity to move on to the NCAA National Tournament 

By ANGELA UN 
Staff \\\iter 

The UCSD women's tennis team 
hosted Grand Canyon University in 
the first round of the National 
Collegiate Athletics Association 
Womens Tennis Championships on 
May l. The Tritons were blessed 
with perfect weather and with a 6-0 
win, giving them a shot at No. 2 
Hawaii-Hilo on May 7. 

UCSD began the match with a 
2-0 lead spawning from the absence 
of Grand Canyon's No. 1 singles 
player, Medini Sharma, the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Player of the Year, who 
was forced to sit out due to a frac-
tured foot. The player loss forced 
Grand Canyon to forfeit the No. 3 
doubles and No. 6 singles positions 
after moving up each of its doubles 
teams and singles players in the line-
up. 

At No. 1 doubles, senior Julie 
Westerman and junior Jasmin Dao 
wasted no time in putting away their 
opponents, Shawna Young and 
Gretta Erickson. A combination of 
double faults and unforced errors 
from the Grand Canyon duo gave 
the Tritons an early lead in the 
beginning of the set. Westerman and 
Dao used a series of smart and well-
placed shots to close out the match 
by a final score of 8-0. 

"We definitely came out ready 
today," Westerman said. "We were 
serving well and not malcing many 
unforced errors. They had switched 
their No.1 and No.2 doubles from 
the last time we played them so we 
were pretty confident." 

Sophomores Tara Siddiqui and 
Leigh Robert played No. 2 doubles 
and had a tougher time closing out 
their match against Nilcita Bhardwaj 
and Sarah Mitchell. The match was 
61led with fast points, powerful shots 
and volleys with both teams rushing 
the net. Siddiqui and ~oberts were 
up, 7-3, in the second set but had a 
tough time winning the final point 
due to a late resurgence by Bhardwaj 
and Mitchell, making the final score 
8-6. 

"At one point, Tara and Leigh 
just stopped moving, but they quick-
ly recognized that and brought their 
focus back in the end," assistant 
coach Timmer Willing said. 

The twO double wins gave the 
Tritons a 4-0 lead going into the sin-
gles matches. No. 3 Siddiqui and 
No. 5 sophomore Marissa Hilker 
gave the fritons the overall match 
win with two quick victories. Hilker 
gave the Tritons win number five 
with 6-2, 6-1 victories over her 
opponent, and Siddiqui sealed the 
match with great shots, frustrating 
her opponent and ending the match 
in consecutive sets, 6-2 and 6-0. 

At No. 1 singles, Westerman 
played some of her best tennis all 
season and outmaneuvered 
Bhardwaj in the first set, 6-5. 
Westerman's hard-hitting serves and 
range of shots helped her overcome 
Bhardwaj'S strong play at the begin-
ning of the set. No. 2 Dao had just 
finished her first set, 6-3, and was 
up, 2-1, in the second set when the 
match was called. At the same time, 
No. 4 Roberts was on her way to

The four-game eries closer 
between UCSD and Cal State 
Stanislaus on May 2 secured the 
Tritons' 2004 postseason berth. 
UCSD won the final game, 8-3 . 
The Tritons took the opener of 
the series, 14-4, and e:>.med an 
extra-innings victory in game 
three, 9-7, on a two-run home 
run by senior designated hitter 
Jeff Riddle. Cal State Stanislaus 
took game two, 6-5. 

The Tritons are now 35-22

Heading into the final week-
end of the regular season, UCSD 
and San Francisco State 
University were knotted in fourth 
place in .the · CCAA standings . 
With the top four teams advanc-
ing to the playoffs, the Tritons 
and the Gators both had their 
sights set on the postseason. 

Prior to the final game in the 
series, UCSD was a half-game 
ahead of San Francisco State in 
the CCAA standings. By winning 
the final game of the season, the 
Tritons took a one and a half-
game lead, making it mathemati-
cally impossible for the Gators to 
catch up, regardless of the out-
come of their May 2 game at 
Grand Canyon in Phoenix. 
UCSD captures the fourth of 
four possible CCAA 
Championship playoff positions. 

In the last home game of the 

2004 season, played on April 28, 
UCSD faced nonconference rival 
Vanguard University and won in 
an 8-6 contest. Senior pitcher 
Nolan DunkJy got his first career 
start on the mound, tossed five 
innings, and went on to earn his 
first collegiate win, giving him a 
perfect 1-0 record. Dunkly 
allowed nine hits, three runs -
two of which were earned - and 
one walk while striking out four. 

Twenty-four Triton players 
took part in the Vanguard game 
and UCSD put up a total of 20 
hits on the day. Junior first base-
man Brian Robinson, junior left 
fielder Ryan Langone, senior 
center fielder Brett Burton and 
junior catcher Matt Anderson 

. each had three hits. Each of 
Anderson's hits were doubles. 
Senior Keith Albrecht and junior 
shortstop Keith Hernandez each 
added two runs, while Hernandez 
tied the single-season hits record 
with 74. 

With the momentum on their 
side, the Tritons rolled into 
Turlock, Calif., and trounced Cal 
State Stanislaus in the series 
opener, 14-4. UCSD pounded 
out 21 hits in the game behind a 
five-run first inning and a six-run 
fourth inning. Hernandez singled 
in the top of the first inning, 
placing him atop the Triton 
charts for having the most hits in 
a single season, with 75. 

Offensively for UCSD, 
Burton went 4-for-5 with two 
runs scored. Riddle went 3-for-4 
with two runs and three RBI. 
Robinson also went 3-for-4 and 
had two RBI and a run scored. 
Albrecht had two hits and crossed 
the plate four times while

runs scored. 

On the mound for the Tritons, 
sophomore starter Jose Navarro 
went seven innings to get the 
win, improving to 5-2 on the sea-
son. Navarro gave up just nine 
hits and four earned runs while 
striking out six Warrior batters. 

The Tritons dropped the 
opener of the doubleheader on 
May 1 by a score of 6-5 after 
leading 5-3 through seven 
innings. In the nightcap of the 
doubleheader, UCSD posted a 9-
7 come-From-behind victory over 
the Warriors. 

Cal State Stanislaus jumped 

out to a 5-0 lead through two 
innings. In the fourth, UCSD 
trailed 7-3 before rallying. The 
Tritons put up two runs in the 
fourth inning with an RBI single 
by Hernandez and a run-scoring 
double by Riddle. UCSD added a 
single run in the following frame 
on an RBI double by Burton, who 
scored on Riddle's double the 
inning before. Still needing a run 
to tie the game, UCSD got a 
leadoff double in the seventh 
from Robinson. After replacing 
Robinson as a base runner, 
Langone advanced to third base
