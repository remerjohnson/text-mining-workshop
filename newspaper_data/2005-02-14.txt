SRTV broadcasts sexual acts 
Koala editor, A.S. appointee York cites free speech 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

In an effort to bolster student 
free speech rights, John Muir 
College enior Steve York broad-
cast an hour-and-a-half segment 
featuring sexual acts he performed 
with an unidentified woman dur-
ing his Student-Run Television 
show, "Koala Tv." 

The Feb. 3 pornography piece 
was the first in a eries of eg-
ments to be ai red in the spirit of 
open exprLs ion, according to 
York, who is al 0 the editor of the 
KoohI and .S. elections manager. 

"I t's my effort to bridge the gap 
between students and their sexual 
desires in a fun way," York said. 
"This i only the first of a number 
of adult works being produced as 
we peak, all of which will be ai rcd 
to the students of this chool. " 

ince RTV is a closed-circuit 
tation, indecency regulations 

specified by the Federal 
Communications Commis ion do 
not apply. SRTV rules allow for 
pornographic broadca ts, as long 
as they are not copyrighted and 
are aired between 10 p.m. and 6 
a.m., according to SRTV station 
manager Chelsea Welch. Despite 
initial surprise about York's piece, 
SRTV had been informed of his 
intentions to air the program last 
fa ll , Welch aid. 

"We were all aware that he was 
going to make this film and there 
were no objections from mem-
LeiS,' Welch s:litl . "After secing 
the film, I was still shocked that he 
actually did it, but I was proud 
that he went through with it." 

The Clo ed-Circuit TV 
Stations Govern:lnce committee, 

Kaia lai/(juardian 
Speech: Koola editor Steve York, "Koala 1V' show host Marissa Crane and a guest 
(left to right) broadcast footage of York engaging in sexual acts on SRlV on Feb. 3. 
establi hed in the fall, is the only 
campus committee that applie 
specifi ally to SRTv. The initial 
format of the committee, drafted 
by Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W Watson, includ-
ed only one student representa-
tive. However, Watson added a 
representative from each of the six 
colleges after complaints from 

.S. President Jcnn Pae. 
The commlttee was created in 

re pon~t: lO the sh utdown uf 
RTV for four days last May, 

stemming from Thornton 
Hospital patients' complaints that 
the station was broadcasting 
obscene material. SRTV man-

agers were uncertain whether the 
material aired was a part of regular 
programming or if a break-in at 
the station occurred because 
administrators refused to explain 
what they saw. 

York considers th committee 
an obstacle to SRTV content. 

"It's obvious from the focus on 
the committee and the student 
represen ta tives on it tha t they do 
not want the administration's 
hanos on ' their' stations and Judg-
ing their content," he said. "I see 
it as another step to control the 
counter-culture of this school that

University executives' high salary 
bonuses cause protests from union 

By MADELINE PHILLIPS 
Contributing Writer 

Last year, 65 executives at the 
University of California received a 
total of almost $2.4 million in 
salary bonuses. The university's 
re lease of this information on Jan. 
10 caused protests from the 
American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
Local 3299, which had been in 
negotiations with the unjversity 
for a new contract concerning the 
wages of lower-level workers. 

Among the recipients of the 
bonuse - which averaged about 
$36,000 - wa UC D avis Medical 
Center CEO Robert Chason, who 
received $82,000 in addition to his 
$410,000 annual salary. 

"{ ur member are furiou ," 
AFSC chief negotiator Paul 
\Vortlunan aid." t a time when 
the university i~ contending that it 

doesn 't have enough money to 
give to the lowest-paid employees 
who haven't had a raise in two 
years, they' re giving huge bonuse 
to executives that already have 
huge salaries." 

However, UC Labor Relations 
spokesman Noel Van yhuis aid 
that the bonuses were part of the 
executive' compensation pack-
ages, as dictated by a decision 
made by the UC Board of Regents 
in 1992. In accordance with this 
resolution, the executives' salaries 
are composed of two parts: a base 
salary and an incentive award, 
which reflects the overall success 
of the medical center, ac rding to 
Va n yhuis. 

"We dcfinitely regret that the 
state budget cuts have prevented a 
systemwide alary increase over 
the past few years," Van yhuis 
sa id. "Whether we will be able to 
depends on the approval of Gov. 

Schwarzenegger's budget by the 
state Legislature." 

However, the wages of lower-
level employees are not the only 
concern of those who are ques-
tioning the bonuses. 

"[The funds] could have been 
used to deal with the shortage of 
taffing, improve the quality of 

care or o ffset the enormous 
increase that students in medical 
chools and working at medical 

centers are paying," Worthman 
said. 

Jennifer Lilla, president of the 
C Student ssociation and a 

gradua te student at UC an 
Francisco, al 0 lamented the los 
of fundi ng for other purpo e .

Chandler to resume role as 
senior vice chancellor 

Former Acting Chancellor Marsha A. 
Chandler will return next fall to resume her 
position as senior vice chancellor of academic 
afTalrs, according to Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox. In a letter to students and staff. Fox stated 
hat Chandler will return from her sabbatical at 

Harvard University to the same position she 
occupied under former chancellor Robert C 
Dynes. 

lM1en the UC Board of Regents promoted 
Dynes to the role of UC president, Chandler took 
over his posinon as head of the campus until a 
new chancellor was selected. Chandler had also 
been considered a candidate for the job. 

1he University is indeed fortunate that 
Marsha has agreed to continue to provide 
exceptional leadership in academic affairs as 
we advance an aggressive UCSD agenda 
toward intemational pre-eminence,' Fox stated 
in the letter. "UCSD is well positioned as a 
leader in the UC system, and I am optimistic 
and eager to continue our progress with a solid 
administrative team in place:' 

David R Miller, who served as senior vice 
chancellor of academic affairs during 
Chandler's leave, will resume his position as 
associate vice chancellor of academic planning 
and resources, according to Fox.

THE UCSD OUARDIAN - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14. 2005 

Designed to reduce the amount of taxes that go 
uncollected every year - currently surpassing 
$300 billion - the report describes 72 proposals 
to reduce tax shelters, dose loopholes and focus 
on other areas of noncompliance. 

Under the plan, two higher education tax 
breaks that allow students and their parents to 
deduct a portion of education costs would be 
combined into one, according to A.c.E. In addi· 
tion, the proposal would redefine portions of 
the tax code that allow students to go without 
paying Social Security and Medicare payroll 
taxes. Known as the student FICA exemption, 
the proposed rules would limit the benefits to 
students who eam no more than $920 in the 
current year. For individuals exceeding the 
limit, all of the students' earnings would be 
subject to the taxes, according to A.c.E. 

Researchers to test 
data-mining programs 

In a joint project paid for by the Department 
of Homeland Security, researchers from UC 
Riverside and Lucent Technologies are testing 
the efficacy of modem data·mining tools used 
by the government to track patterns of behavior 
that may reveal threats to national security. 
Because of the implications of the findings, the' 
department asked researchers not to describe 
the details of the data included in the projects, 
the university stated in a press release. In gen-
eral terms, the project will examine programs 
that use statistics and computers to look at large 
amounts of gathered facts. The ·project will 
make it easier for the Riverside campus to 
secure future government funding, the universi-
ty stated. 

Study suggests proteins 
similar among organisms 
Similarities in protein 'wiring' -of three dis-

tantly related species - yeas~ worms and the 
fruit fly - may offer a new way of developing 
more effective phannaceuticals with fewer side 
effects, researchers from UCSD, Israel and 
Gennany have jointly reported. In an original 
study, researchers predicted that the new data 
could help experts track protein interactions 
and improve on the current trial-and-error 
method used for drug development 

"Ultimately, this type of wiring analysis will 
help us more fully explain how the diversity of 
life develotJed on the planet and, more practi· 
cally, how a pathogen differs from its host or a 
diseased cell differs from its healthy counter-
part at the most informative level of detail:

have been some way to use those funds in a 
way that would have helped a great number 
of people instead of just a few." 

Van Nyhuis said, however, that the funds 
were specifically earmarked for the purpose 
of compensating executives and could not 
have been used for any other cause. 

As to the future of the negotiations 
between the AFSCME and the University of 
California, Van Nyhuis and Worthman differ 
in opinion. The union considers the media-
tions over, according to Worthman. 
However, Van Nyhuis believes that an agree-
ment over a new contract may still be 

reached. 
Given the state of negotiations, Lilla 

maintains that whatever the true origin of 
the funds was, it is unfortunate that they had 
to be used at such an inconvenient time. 

"I personally have no problem with the 
fact that they were given raises, but the tim-
ing is quite poor, given the dire straits that 
the university is in right now," Lill a said. 
"There is a lot of other staff without pay 
raises and the timing is very unpleasant for 
students and staff alii...e."

MONDAY. FEBRUARY 14. Z005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

SRTV: York ready to respond to litigation 
. continued from page I 

has kept the status quo in check for 
as long as this campus has existed." 

Members of the committee will 
not regulate content, but merely 
"review the mission, governance 
and operations status and guide-
lines for the college and ASUCSD 
campus television stations, and dis-
cuss, with those responsible for 
each of the stations, changes in the 
guidelines needed to make [them I 
explicitly clear," according to the 
committee's official description. 

The last committee meeting is 
scheduled for Feb. 14, before a 
report summarizing comem 
responsibility is submitted to 
Watson, according to Welch. 

Committee members have nor 
addressed and do not plan to address 
York's broadcast, according to com-
mittee chair and Director of Student 
Policies andJudicial Affairs icholas 
S. Aguilar. 

"The committee has not been 
asked to respond to the incident," 
Aguilar said. "It is not the charge of 

the committee to respond to spe-
cific complaints, but only to answer 
questions that arise out of the cam-
pus charter for the vice chancellor." 

A.S. representatives support all 
avenues of SRTV free speech, 
according to A.S. Commissioner of 
Student Services Kian Malelci. 

"[The Associated Students) 
hopes that the administration con-
siders the age and breadth of the 
audience SRTV caters to if the 
time comes that they decide to 
make some changes," Malelci said. 
"The administration is frequently 
trying to tighten purse-strings 
where it can, and controversial ser-
vices like [SRTV] .. . are constantly 
feeling the pinch." 

A.S. Adviser Lauren Weiner also 
contacted SRTV managers con-
cerning York's show, according to 
Welch. 

"She was very objective about it 
and she wanted to know what had 
been aired and how it was in com-
pliance with SRTV's charter and 
bylaws so that if she was asked 

questions about it, she would know 
what to say," Welch said. "I talked 
to her about it and went through 
how the film did not violate FCC 
regulations regarding obscenity, 
and that was it." 

Despite support from SRTV 
and Associated Students, York is 
ready to respond if any action is 
taken against his show. 

"If a1\y legal action is taken or 
further pressed, 1 will have no 
problem assembling a coalition of 
free-speech supporters and the 
entire might of the adult industry 
to bear against this school for 
infringing on our rights as adults 
and students paying for our own 
television services," York said. 

If students are opposed to any 
SRTV broadcast, Associated 
Students encourages their partici-
pation in programming efforts , 
according to Malelci.

EPA: Whitman encourages political moderates 
continued from page J 

first time since 1952 that neither 
party is goi ng to have an incumbent 
running, either a president running 
for re-election or a vice president 
ready to step up, " she said. "So it's 
a perfect rime for the parties to step 
back and take a look at where they 
are and where they're going." 

Whitman encouraged moderate 
Republicans to network and orga-
nize to build strong coalitions and 
to support moderate candidates at 
the local and state levels. 

"In the book, I outlined the 
issues that I think are important, 
that we need to be focusing on as 

moderates, and have some sugges-
tions of what people can do in their 
communities ... to try to create an 
atmosphere that would allow for 
moderates to actually be considered 
for the presidency," Whitman said. 

In addition to discussing her 
book, Whitman also offered her per-
spectives on several political issues, 
including the war on terrorism and 
the American presence in Iraq. 

"We all were changed after 
Sept. II , but no one more deeply 
than the president," Whitman said. 
"I honestly bel ieve, as much as now 
we talk about being in Iraq to 
spread democracy and freedom, 

that the president'S underlying and 
ovetwhelming commitment to the 
American people is to never let a 
9/11 happen again." 

The Republican National 
Committee could not be reached 
for comment in response to 
Whitman's talk. 

Whitman's interview was a part 
of the Revelle Forum, a series of 
lectures, readings and public lIher-
views with prominent figures in 
an s, literature, current events and 
the media.

Margaret Spellings: 
How will she lead? 
Ed. secretary politicizes position 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

T hree months after what was arguably the most contested and fiery election in history, 
the jihad between liberals and con-
serva tives rages on for millions of 
Americans: 

Ask a Democrat about any of 
President George W. Bush's poli-
cle , from the largest issues (WAR!) 
to the mall est details (use of silver-
ware in the White House), and an 
inevita ble landslide of talking 
points follows. In a presidency that 
boasts the highest approval rating 
in his tory from one-half of the 
country, and the lowest approval 
ra ting in his tory from the other 
half, every single policy has become 
a politicized battleground where 
defamed Democrats can attempt to 
"take back the country" from their 
conservative propagandist oppres-
.ors, and Republicans can "preserve 
fa mily values" from the influence of 
dissident rebels who seek to poison 
the minds of their constituents. 

The issue of edu cation has 
al ways been a political one - most 
allocations of ti.l1lding for stagnant 
bureaucracies are - but the battl e 
was taken to a new level last 
Novcmber with Bush's nomination 
of l\largaret Spelli ngs as secretary 
of education, replacing previous 
sccretaty Rod Paige, who resigned 
under mYE terious ci rcumsta nces 
sho rtly after Bush '~ re-election. 
The main battle, of course, 
IIlvolved "I 0 Child Left Behind," 
the dubiously fu nded standardized-
testing program which, depending 
on who you ask, ha either bank-
rupted our public school system by 
shoving another burea ucratic hur-
dle down its throat or brought our 
'chools up in qua li ty by holding 
every teacher accountable for the 
performance of the students. 

As the author of th e Texas pro-
gram which fo rmed the basis for 
u,40 Chi ld Left 13ehind," Speli ings 
can not help but attrac t this con-
troversy, but certain oth er fac tors 
III her background turn this politi-
ca l battle into an all -out culture 

war. A5 the only education secre-
tary in history wi th primary-
school-age children at the time of 
her appointment, Spellings is a 
perfect figurehead for the "family 
values" banner. Yet, when one of 
those children also attends a pri-
vate Catholic school, Spell ings' 
lack of faith in the public school 
system for her own children makes 
her an equally important symbol 
for the "rich elitists running the 
White House" banner. One could 
onry hope that, in her ro le as chief 
educator of the nation, Spellings 
could attempt to play down these 
conflicting political ideologies and 
deal .with the administrative prob-
lems plaguing "No Child Left 
Behind," a goal that both sides can 
agree on. 

But in the arena of public educa-
tion, hopes can never be fully real-
ized, and in Spellings' case they are 
dashed entirely. Earlier this month, 
Spellings criticized PBS for plan-
ning to air an episode of "Postcards 
from Buster" that featured an ani-
mated bunny talking to a family 
with two mommies. For days, pun-
dits exploded on both sides with 
either rage or admiration. PBS, in a 
surprisingly "edgy" move, offered 
the episode to any TV station will-
ing to snub the Department of 
Education. And , through all of the 
mayhem and shouting, nobody 
seemed to notice that the sweeping 
reforms of " 0 Child Left Behind " 
promised by Bush simply did not 
happen , whether these reforms 
were of the liberal sort (fund the 
program "properly") or the conser-
vative sort (help individual schools 
"comply" with the program). A 
separate scandal, involving "fake" 
reporters and pundits paid off to 
endorse "No Child Left Behind," 
only added fuel to the fire . 

This is the danger of such politi-
cized policy; while pundits may 
inflate their egos by crusading 
against one option or the other, the 
poiicy itself nearly always sutters a 
lack of results. This spells doom 
anew for" 0 Child Left Behind," 
as well as for another program that 
hits a little closer to home: Pe.l1 

Grants. 
Pell Grants, federal godsends 

for those who qualify for, are a cru-
cial part of financial aid for many of 
our nation's brightest who could 
otherwise not afford secondary 
education. Since anything less than 
a masters' degree qualifies our 
nation's students for little more 
than a rewarding career in the food 
service industry, programs like Pell 
Grants are necessary components 
for ensuring that American indus-
try remains competitive in the 
international market. Yet, with all 
of this nonsense going on in the 
Department of Education about 
standardized testing and lesbian 
cartoons, precious little effort is 
spent on Pell Grants, a service that 
offers to move many students above 
the food service level. 

Even when scant effort is being 
put into Pell Grants, the talons of 
political pandering are seldom far 
behind : According to the National 
Association of Student Financial 
Aid Admin istrators 
(bttp:l IWWW .11osfaa.org/pub/ico-
tiollsl2 004/groxtob/esupdau 12 23 04.b 

tm~, the only major action seen 
from the new Department of 
Education was a revamping of tax 
tables that laid the framework for 
some major-league partisan squab-
bling. Of course, conservatives and 
"taxpayer groups" love the idea of 
revamping the tax basis for finan-
cial aid ; just look at the wonders it 
has done for their base with the 
recent tax cuts on the national 
level. Of course, liberals and stu-
dents equally hate' this idea, as it 
stands to leave behind tens of thou-
sands of children who no longer 
meet the tax requirements to 
receive aid . 

Spe.l1ings has an interesting, if 
partisan, opinion on this tax change: 
When asked if the government was, 
in fact, "slashing" Pe.l1 Grants. she 
stated that if Bush's budget is 
passed, it would instead increase 
Pell Gra nt funds by six percent. 
(http://www. whiuhoust .gov/oskI2 004 
05J4.hrml). The obvious question 
is, why hold the future of Pell 
Grants hostage to a somewhat 

unrelated, hopelessly partisan issue? 
Perhaps Spellings feels that coer-
cion is the only method available to 
bridge the ideological gap between 
herself and the liberals on Capitol 
Hill. Whether you agree with this 
method for funding Pell Grants or 
not, you cannot deny that it follows 
her general trend of foolishly invit-
ing partisan battles. 

So then, what is the solution to 
these problems with "No Child 
Left Behi nti" and Pel! Grants? 
None exists. For liberals and con-
servatives will fight until the end 
of days, when the earth will open 
up to swallow them both . Well. 
maybe not, but it would take an

act of God (and not just the con-

but the fire -and-brimstone one) 
to take politics out o f the 
Department of Education and get 
it back to the business of improv-
ing schools in a nonpartisan , or :It 
least nonpoliticized, fashion . 
Perhaps a change of power in four 
years could yield some positive 
results, but more likely than not

when you can get away with it. So, 
with my newfound epiphany in 
mind. I diagrammed UCSD's ten-
week cycle of absences: 

First week: Students are psy-
ched, which means we're slightly 
less grumpy than usual. Classrooms 
are filled wall-to-wall IO minutes 
before each class is scheduled to 
start; we're eager to meet our 
(hopefully good-looking and intel-
ligently sexy) professors and our 
(hopefully good-looking and intel-
ligently sexy) classmates. And, of 
course. to size up the syllabus, 
which we wi ll promptly lose . One 
clueless asshole asks the professor 
about the grading policy even 
though it's prihted in l6-point font 
on the very top of the syllabus; 
everyone takes note of who the ass-
hole is and ostracizes him/her for 
the rest of the quarter. Class is 
adjourned after twenty minutes; 

most students disappear, not to be 
seen again until the day of the 
midterm. 

Second week: The only people 
in class are the people working for 
A.S. Lecture Notes, insufferable 
overachievers and people lusting 
after the professor, who usually 
wear short skirts and sit in the front 
row. 

Third week: Facing a nearly 
empty room, the professor com-
plains that no one comes to his 
office hours and reminds students 
that "office hours are for you" and 
"it's boring to have to sit in my 
office for two hours when no one 
comes to visit." Then he adjourns 
class 10 minutes early so he can 
weep in private. 

Fourth week: Students go to 
office hours to ask professor what 
will be on the midterm. Nervous

Return--to--aid unnecessary 
for self--assessed fees 

By DANIEL WArn 
Senior Staff Writer 

We pay a IQt to this university: 
almost $5,000 per year in "educa-
tion fees" a lone. 

Up to one-fourth of that may 
be going to the people sitting next 
to you. It's called "return-to-aid," 
a requirement that the University 
of California allocate 25 percent 
of every education fee increase to 
financial aid . This is suppa cd to 
he.lp compensate low-income stu-
dents whose curren . financial aid 
plan cannot keep up with rising 
education costs. 

The university plans to expand 
this program in March, with a new 
proposal coming out of the UC 
Office of the President that would 
divert money to scholarships not 
only from educational fees, but 
also from self-imposed, student-
ini tiated fees. 

R~nlrn-(O-aid stipulations are 
a reasonably fair method of 
spreading the burden of budget 
cuts. The fee increases hurt the 
students who can afford to be 
hurt, while helping those who 
absolutely cannot absorb anmher 
fin ancial hit. Without return-to-
aid, general fees for all students 
would be more affordable, per-
haps 25 or 33 percent lower than 
they arc now - but low-income 
student might be forced to drop 
out of school. 

UCOP 's new proposal hurts 
everyone. It eoulJ force us to sac-
ri fice a percentage of an y UCSD-
spec ific campus fee that we 
impose upon ourselves. In the past 
decade, UC SD undergraduates 
have voted countless small fee 

increases upon themselves, all of 
which would have been affected 
by the UCOP proposal had it 
been implemeined earlier. 

If the proposal hacl been in 
effect four years ago, 25 percent of 
the Price Center expansion 
money wou ld be going toward 
financial aid instead of a new food 
court; 25 percent of the intercoll e-
giate athletics fee would fund low-
income scholarships and not 
UCSD 's sports teams; and 25 per-

" Imagine if Sun God fes tival was 25~percent 
smaller, or if recreation 
facilities cost students 

$345 per year instead of 
the current $276, That's 

the choice UCO P is 
,a. ' " OJ) e71ng us ,,' 

cent of each college council's ref-
erendum-aided budget would be 
'gone, making it difficult to fund 
their annual college-based con-
certs and semiformal dances . 
Imagine if Sun God festival was 
25-pcrcent smaller, or if recre-
ation facilities cost students $345 
per year instead of the current 
$276. That's the choice UCOP is 
offerir. g us : declining benefits, or 
a 25-percent hike in the rates we 
pay for them. 

Return-to-aid requirements 

make some sense for university-
imposed fees. The regents are 
raising those fees, not the stu-
dents. Students have no control 
over the budget by which their 
educational fees are spent. And 
the fees are raised by so much in a 
single hike that they po e a dilem-
ma to students who carefully bud-
geted their money for four-year 
stints at UCSD. 

It makes sense that students 
receive aid to offset fee increases 
over which they have no control, 
but return-to-aid is ridiculous for 
self-i mposed fees . Students vote 
these fees upon themselves. The 
$92 -per-quarter recreational facil-
ity fee was approved by a student 
vote, as was the $37.50 Price 
Center fee, the $29 intercollegiate 
athletics fee , the $2 1 Associated 
Students campus activity fee and 
the activity fee at each of the six 
colleges. In cases such as these, it's 
our own damn fault that we raise 
fees, so we do not deserve finan-
cial aid to compensate for them. 

Also, the self-imposed campus 
fees are so small that earmarking 
25 percent of them to scholarships 
would not really help low-income 
tudents. A Warren student pays 

only $4 per quarter to his student 
council; does he really need finan-
cial aiJ to cover that' 

On the other hand, taking a 
dollar of each student's fee away 
from the council would decrease 
its budget by around $12,000 per 
year - about the cOSt of the annu-
al semiformal dance. 

It hurts student life far more to 
grab a dollar for financial aid than 
it does to raise fees by a couple 
bucks. 

OPINION S 

R I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Academic freedom bill 

overreaches 
Editor: 

In the last two decades, our 
e.lected officials, both in the state 
and federal governments, have got-
ten us used to all sortS of silliness, 
and the proposed bill to "ban pro-
fessors' indoctrination" appears to 
be the latest one. 

To think that political and ideo-
logical opinions can be separated 
from other aspects of one's life, be 
they choosing a brand of cereal or 
teaching a lesson, reveals a mind so 
simplistic that it should have no 
place in the legislative body of a 
modern state. 

Things wi ll become interesting, 
though : Consider, for instance, that 
most engineering professors 
endorse, more or less openly, the 
industrial ethos, an endorsement 
that is defini tely a political posi-
tion, n t to mention that "technol-
ogy" itself is a form of ideology. 

If the bill passes, I have some 
advice for aU engineering students: 
Next time you have an assignment 
on harmonic analysis or partial dif-
ferential equations that you don't

clueless asshole who asks if they 
will need to bring a bluebook. 

Fifth week: Midterm day! 
Classroom is packed oncc again. 
The detested curve-sctter finishes 
midterm in twenty minutes; the 
rest of the class quietly takes the 
exam, then leaves, never to be seen 
again - unci I the tinal. 

Sixth week: With luidterms out 
of the way, no one comes to class. 
Professor talks to himself and 
draws funny pictures on the black-
board. 

Seventh week: Around 10 stu-
dents realized they missed th e 
midterm and come to class to beg 
for another chance to take it. T he 
rest of the class comes to as k 
whether the midterm will be 
curved. 

Eighth week: During sparsely 
attended lectures the professor 
mocks stude nts, tells a story about 
his trip to France and extols the 
virtues of barber shaves. T he few

tend to appreciate his stories while

Ninth week: Pre-final jitters hit; 
classroom fills up once again with 
people who realize they don't know 
the professor's name, the topic of 
the class or what they did with the 
syllabus. Clueless asshole inter-
rupts lecture to ask what will be on 
the final. Fed up, the professor 
makes a sarcastic re mark in 
respome to the clueless ~ssho l e ; 
class laughs. 

Tenth week: A few students 
come to class, hoping that the pro-
fessor will drop hints about what 
will be asked on the final. The rest 
of the class simply can't be both-
ered to get out of bed, even though 
the class is held at three in the 
afternoon. 

Finals week: Students wander 
in, take final, and wander out, 
immediately forgetting everything 
pertaining to the class. The detest-
ed curve-setter finishes exam in 40 
minutes and smugly walks out of 
the class to enjoy a V8 Splash in the 
sunshine outside. 

Then, of course, the stuJents 
head off to vacation, and the cyel<;

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14,2005 THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Units: Students concerned 
about proposed unit fees 

continued from page I 
a problem." 

A draft of the policy states that 
the fee would be equivalent to the 
marginal COSt of education of an 
academic year. It would be charged 
on a per-unit basis up to the normal 
course load of 12 units per quarter, 
at which point it would become a 
flat fee. 

Fee assessment would begin no 
earlier than the 2007-08 academic 
year, and the university would not 
provide UC financial aid for years 
in which the student surpasses the 
unit limit. However, students 
would continue to be eligible for 
outside financial aid from federal 
sources or private agencies, accord-
ing to the proposal draft. 

Both Appelbaum and the UC 
Office of the President have said 
that the proposal is sti ll in its infan-
cy and further details shoul d 
become available as they are 
worked out in the next two (0 three 
months. 

"[This] is a collective, system-
wide process - undergraduate 
deans, the council of vice chancel-
lors, Board of Regents and othe.rs 
will offer their input and the Office 
of the President will eventuall y 
declare a policy," Appelbaum said. 

Under the proposal, summer 
would not be included in determin-
ing the total number of enrolled 
quarters, but the W1its earned by 
completing UC summer coursework 
would be counted toward the limit. 

The draft notes that excepcions 
may be made to raise the unit 
threshold, but only in individual 
cases that can be justified in acade-
mic terms. 

Appelbaum said he is working 
closely with other administrators to 
ensure that all students get at least 
four years to pursue their degrees. 

"Every student has four years 
before anyone starts looking to kick 
him or her out," Appelbaum said. 
"Each student, however, will have a 
different number of maximum 
units depending on their college 
and major." 

The details for double majors 
have not yet been finalized, he said. 

The governor's office did not 
respond to calls requesting com-
ment. 

Several students said they were 
concerned about the proposal. 

"I think it's ridiculous that they 
want to penalize us for striving to 
be well -rounded people,~ said UC 
Berkeley junior Tracey Ross, a 
double major. "The y are concinu-
ously making our educational sys-
tem into some sort of factory, just 
rryi ng to get us in and get us out. 
They don't realize that we are 
being shaped by knowledge and ~ 
experiences." 

Revelle College junior and dou-
ble major Erik Laurinovics said his 
opinion of the plan was mixed . 

"There's a fine line between 
wancing to learn more and hanging 
around too long," Laurinovics said. 
"I understand why they want to do 
thi s, but it makes it difficult for 
double majors and students who go 
[into college] undeclared and don't 
decidc their major until the end of 
sophomore year. " 

Appelbaum emphasized that the 
proposal is an effort by the state to 
help alleviate California's precari-
ous financial situation. 

"This is not generating a sur-
plus that will go somewhere else," 
Appelbaum said. "This is simply an 
attempt to reduce our state deficit 
and offset the budget cuts."

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for a Valentine's Day your significant other will never forget The ultimate thing to do on valentine's 
Day is to surprise your lover and do something unex-
pected. This idea is taken from a friend's ex-boyfriend 
who worked at Party City_ Working at Party City provides 
eiJSY access to many Valentine's Day goodies. and, most importantly, bal-
loons. He acquired about 50 balloons in his girlfriend's favorite colors. 

The gift seemed typical at first. but the catch is that he placed a neck-
lace with a heart pendant into one of these seemingly ordinaIY balloons. 
He left the balloons in his room and went to pick up his gilffriend. As 
soon as he saw her he exclaimed that he had fOigoaen someching at 
home, so he and his girlfriend went back into the house to search for the 
'ost item~ 

'Men his girlfriend saw the balloons, she thought that he was plan-
ning on having a party, but instead he handed her a needle and request-
ed that she pop as many balloons as it would take until she could find 
her present. ~ vigor she popped balloons until the neddace with the 
heart pendant dropped at her feel

MONDAY 
FEBRUARY 14, 2005 

For most people, valentine's Day is a day for showing your significant other just how much you real -ly love them. This usually entails buying them roses, taking them out to a fancy restaurant and hav-ing heated bouts of sex under the stars. Well, something to that effect anyway. I had a similar con-
ception of V-day when I was 16, but my girlfriend at the t ime (whose name I will change to Jennifer to 
save her any embarrassment) did not 

It was Feb. 13, 1998, and I was diligently searching for the perfect Valentine's Day gift for Jennifer. I 
tossed aside the old roses-and-chocolates idea in favor of a more personalized gift-giving option. After 
deliberating for a while, I decided to get her a gold-plated Guess wristwatch with an endearing engraving 
on the back and a bouquet of pink and white camations, which I knew she adored, and In addition to tak-
ing her out to a nice dinner. 

That very same day, without my knowing. Jennifer had been searching for a 
gift to give me. Her only problem was that she had no clue what I wanted, 
because she simply forgot to ask, and I never told her because I wasn't expect-
ing anything. Nevertheless, she found something ... and I damn near choked 
when I saw it 

That night. after having given Jennifer her gift and reveling in the giant smile 
she gave me when she opened it, I went to shower and got ready to go out to 
dinner. Little did I know the surprise that would be waiting for me when I 
stepped back into my room. I pushed open the door, and there sitting on my 
desk was an enormous black scorpion. It stood, pinned to a stick, staring at me 
with its beady eyes through a plastic case. At the foot of the casing was a letter 
that read, ·Happy Valentine's Day~ 

Happy Valentine's Day indeed! Nothing says I love you like a skewered, dead 
arachnid. 

- Hans Fellman, Features Editor 

Fora holiday stereotyped by hearts, chocolates and flowers, 1--------------, showering roses onto your sig-
nificant other may seem unimpres-
sive, but with the right touch, a 
flower can say a ~housand words. 

One girl (to remain anonymous) 
sent her ex-significant other two red 
roses and a yellow one. A red rose 
to signify each of their love, and a 
yellow rose to signify the friendship 

My friend's boyfriend seemed to know the right things to do on 
valentine's Day, and he surprised 
her with m any gifts. These gifts 
were plentiful and intricate, but 
he didn't buy or deliver the gifts 
himself - his mother did. 
Needless to say, the m ost excit-
ing part of my friend's Valentine's 
Day was waiting and watching 
her boyfriend's mom deliver and 
present gifts to her. 

between them. 
For this Valentine's Day, you too 

can say "I love you· in primary col-
ors. 

- Jia Gu, Associate Features Editor The moral? Don't ask your 
mom to buy the gifts for you, ann 
don't ask her to deliver them for 

you. At least this way your significant other will know you made an effort, 
and not your mother. 

L ~our is in the air, and what better time is there in the year to confess your true love to your true lover? Valentine's Day is a 
wonderful excuse to spill the beans and adm~ 
your crush. Both single guys and girls will appre-
ciate any form of recognition on the ultimate day 
of love. 

If the timing. situation, and moment is righ~ 
one thing you should consider doing on 
Valentine's Day is admitting that secret buried 
within the depths of your soul. 

So what have you got to lose? If he or she 
shoots you down, be comforted by the fact that 
you confessed your secret in the name of all-
encompassing love.

MONDAY, FEBRUARY H,2005 

By CHR.5nNE ME 
Associate Features Editor 

Juliet said that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet She's right on the money, but for some guys, knowing the right name is important Indeed, 
whatever the name, a gift of flowers alone will be appre-
ciated. To see that extra sparkle in her eye, however, 
requires extra thought on which flowers to give. 

Some women are picky about flowers while others are 
indifferent toward them, but it is, of course, Valentine's 
Day. If you're going to be spending some cash on flow-
ers, be sure to at least choose the right kind. The best 
blossoms to give to your leading lady are the ones you 
know she likes best If you don't know her favorite, ask 
her friends or roommates who might. Bur for those of 
you who are clueless and think that any flower will do, 
consider the following words of advice: 

The safest bet is the 
rose. Valentine's Day 
without red roses is like 
St Patrick's Day without 
shamrocks, or a binhday 
party without cake. As an 
everlasting symbol of 
love, the red, red rose 
will not fail to delight 
your valentine. If you 
believe them to be too 
cliche but can't manage 
to ignore them entirely, 
try tweaking their image. 
There are other colors in the spectrwn of a rose's versa-
tility, though red is illS dominant color. Consider pink or 
amber roses, cream ones with pinJc. edges or lavender 
ones, if you can find them. Have faith in roses and try to 
look past their high price. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

"Carnations seem so impersonal and last minute," 
Thurgood Marshall College junior Cathy Lee said. 
"It's what you get at the end of the year in high school 
for participating in a club along with 200 other mem-
bers." 

Don't try to give carnations to your significant 
other on Valentine's Day unless you know she loves 
them. Although they're &my pretty to look at, cu-
nations have the reputation of being the cheaper 
flower option, which, unfortunately enough, causes 
some disdain. But unlilce roses, carnations have a 
long vase life and will live longer to impress your 
lover. 

For a less conventional option, give 
your girlfriend a bouquet of calla lilies. 

With their long stems and simple shape, these satiny 
white, rrumpetli\ce blooms have an air of elegance to 
them that is perfect for the sophisticated woman. 
Remember that in many cases, simplicity is key. 

FEATURES 10 

As a symbol of perfection, orchids are yet another 
option for a Valentine's gift. More commonly seen in 
Hawaiian leis or balmy California backyards, orchids stiU 
hold the potential to be an alluring gift. Ranging from 
deep purples to yellow to creamy white, orchids have an 

exotic aura to them 
that will surprise your 
valentine. 

Already arranged 
and prepared accord-
ing to the visual aes-
thetic of the florist, a 

. bouquet of mixed flow-
ers is the easy way out. However, it is crucial to choose the 
right bunch. Some bouquellS are more tastefully arranged 
than others, while some can be a horrible mass of color-
clas~ing weeds. Focus on the bouquets with simpler combi-
nations and avoid the ones that have too much leafy foliage. 

Take heed when buying flowers that have special mean-
ing. Daisies and Wies afe symbols of innocence and purity, 
while irises and poppies represent death. Yellow roses signi-
fy varying meanings of friendship or infidelity. 

Whether it's daisies or peonies, sunflowers or daffodils, 
much can be expressed in the gift of a charming bouquet, as 
it shows that you care on the one day you can pamper your 
lover or potential lover-to-be. So good luck with your 
flower-giving endeavors and more flower power to you. I

East beats West in 
Tantric love-making 

Basic techniques and rituals 

Verdict on Tom, Nicole and many more 
Writers comment on cinema 's sexiest scenes 

can Improve everyday sex 

The Sex 
Guardian 

Lillian Nedwick 

V oila. Here it is - a Valentine's Day edition of the Sex Guardian, as would 
be expected on a day' such as this. 
What is the topic? The elusive and 
fabled ancient Indian practice of 
Tantric sex - which by the way, 
does not comprise ancient secrets to 
suddenly improve your intercourse 
so that you and your partner may 
have the quickest, most amazing 
orgasms of your lives. The Tantra is 
not about orgasm at all . VVhat, sex 
without an orgasm? Exactly. 

Western society has two concep-
tions about sex that the Tantra is 
decidedly against. First, that the 
great "0" is the ultimate and most 
important goal. Second, that it is 
absolutely necessary to make a di -
tinction between the sacred and the 
profane in love - in other words, 
no sex ill church. 

Tantra is a source of piritual 
enlightenment, with sex being the 
pleasure vehicle. Essentia lly, onc 
would reach enl ightenment and 
understanding in thc spaces between 
the ultimate expression of loving 
creation in our bodies and tllC Illind-
freeing feeling of pleasure. J r is nor a 
religious practice, tllough; it is spiri-
tual. Orgasm is son of taken for 

granted as a byproduct of the rituals 
and meditation that accompany 
coital activities. Ir is said that the 
man may experience multiple 
orgasms, but that is because he is 
holding his ejaculate, meditating 
through it and having full-body 
orgasms that are the result of the 
alignment of the chakras (intangible 
focal centers in the body). 

Tantra is a discipline, sometimes 
called the "Yoga of Sex." Essentially, 
practitioners believe that sexual 
energy is extremely powerful, and 
Tantra is what harnesses this ellergy 
and makes it useful to the practicing 
Buddhist. This energy is very 
focused on the woman. While the 
man holds his ejaculate, he is espe-
cially attuned to the pleasure of the 
woman, who is encouraged to expe-
rience many orgasms in a single ses-
sIon. 

So, how docs this information 
help you, the reader? Well, non-
Buddhists probably won't convert 
simply to find the great light in sex. 
But you can infuse bits and pieces of 
the lessons and rituals shown in 
Tantric sex into your everyday, lov-
ing sex to improve the connection 
between you and your lover. 

Consider the meditative aspect 
of Tantra, which is extremely 
focused on breathing techniques. 
The tendency during sex is to hold 
one's breath, creating tensions to be 
released during orgasm. Let's try 
someth ing different: controlled, 
deep breaths that induce a trance,

Valentine's Day sucks, but sex is 
good. If you don't have a valentine, 
or a sex parmer, console your 
lonely self with steamy sex scenes 
that you will probably never live 
out. 

Three writers comment on the 
most infamous of sex scenes in 
recent American and international 
cinema. 

EYES WIDE SHUT 

T he b uzz: This controversial 
erotic thriller directed by Stanley 
Kubrick consists of a doctor's sex-
ual explorations, from his 
encounter with a dead patient's 
daughter to a streetwalker, a pre-
teen nympho, and finally, a masked 
orgy of wealthy elites fraternizing 
to the sound of gongs and violas. 

Riley: May~ we should watch the 
beginning of rhe movie before we 
get to the sex scenes so we under-
stand it better ... 
J ia: It's sex. Whats there to under-
stand? 
R: Wait, aren't men suppose to 
want to get straight to the sex, and 
women want all the foreplay? 
<pause> Ready for a shot, by the 
way? 
J: Bring the chocolates in. What's 
better than sex and chocolates? 

Scene I : Ata Christmas ball, Alice 
Harford (Nicole Kidman) flirtS 
and flaps with an elderly Lothario. 

J: She's so drunk! 
R: That means the sex is corning. 

Scene 2: After hearing about his 

GIVE YOUR VISUAL CORTEX A HEADS-UP. 

wife's sexual fantasies over another 
stranger, Bill Hartford (Tom 
Cruise) walks the streets, until 
picked up by a streetwalker. Upon 
entering her flat, they converse . 

R: T hey're still talking. They're 
definitely having sex. 
J : Fast forward, fast forward! 
R: Tell me when to stop fast for-
warding. 
J : No, no, no. When they get real -
ly undressed. I don't want to watch 
them flirt. 
R: The jacket's back on. That was 
a disappointment. 

J : Three stars. This whole movie 

" This whole movie has 
been. US speculating 

they're having sex, but no 
one is really having sex." 
has been us speculating they' re 
having sex, but no one is rea lly 
having sex. 
R: Five stars plus three for exces-
sive nudity. 

The verdict: The sexual tensio n 
sizzles, but the movie never really 
delivers the much-hyped goods (at 
least not the American version) 

SECRETARY 

T he buzz: Recently relea ed 
from a mental hospital, Lee 
Holloway is hired as a secretarial 
assistant to Edward G rey Oames 
Spader) and begins to develop an 
obsessive crush. Their employer-

cmpluyee rela tiunship lUrn~ 'cxual 
when both begin to explore their 
S&M tendencies. 

Scene I: After discuveri ng several 
crrors ina typed lettcr, I r. Grey 
invites Lee into hIS office, asks her 
to bend over and read the It:ller 
aloud, and proceed~ to spank her 
after every word. 

R: Is this a cul t favorite of sado-
masochists everywhere ' 
J: I don't know, but It'S re:tlly hot. 
Scene 2 : After reporting what's 
served at the dinncr table, Mr. 
Grey instructs Lee to cat ollly a 
scoop of potatoes, four peas and as 
much ice cream as she likes. After 
following his in tructions to the 
pea, Lee rushes to her rOOI11 ~ nd 
proceeds to masrurbate to the idea 
of potatoes and peas. 

J: Girls don 't really Ill:! turbate 
like that. . 
R: They don't? I'm going to pre-
tend I never heard that. 

J: even stars. Ider men ? Pain' 
Power? You call 't deny that. 
R: Six stars. Not exactly Illy lng, 
baby, but 1'111 open mi ndcd. 

T he verdict: Pain W,IS never so 
sexy.

T he b u zz: Teenagers -Ienoc h

Zapata (Gael Garda Bernal) find 
themselves taking a road trip to a

By LAURA CANTER 
Staff Writer 

Valentine's Day has arrived, a day for showing appreciation for that special someone by buying flowers, giving romantic greeting cards and whispering 
sweet nothings in that loved one's ear. In San Diego, going out to eat at a 

nice restaurant on Valentine's Day with the masses can get tedious and can really 
kill the mood. This year, do something different: Learn how to cook a special meal, 
a meal so special that an interesting dessert, one not necessarily involving food, 
may follow it. This is the perfect occasion to explore the world of aphrodisiac foods. 

Many people are not aware of these stimulating cuisines nor which foods fall into 
th is category. Just to get an idea of exactly how these foods provoke someone for 
the better, delve into some of the effects of each individual aphrodisiac. Asparagus 
was served to 19th-century bridegrooms because of its reputed aphrodisiac powers. 
Bananas have a creamy, lush texture , and some studies show that they contain an 
enzyme, bromelain, that enhances male sexual performance. Caviar, for those who 
can afford it, is high in zinc, which stimulates the formation of testosterone, main-
taining male functionality. Champagne, which is known as the "drink of love,· has 
moderate qualities that lower inhibitions and cause a nice, warm glow in the body. 
Chocolate is a well· known aphrodisiac, containing both a sedative, which relaxes 
the body and a stimulant, which increases the desire for physical contact. 
Interestingly enough, chocolate was banned from monasteries centuries ago due to 
these effects. Oysters, on the other hand, are aphrodisiacs that affect people psy-
chologically. Oysters are known to change their gender from male to female and 
back, giving rise to claims that tile oyster lets one experience both the masculine 
and the feminine sides of love; plus, It is a food that people eat with their fingers. 
The radish was considered a divine aphrodisiac by Egyptian pharaohs because its 
spicy taste stimulates the palate, bringing attention to the mouth and making a per-
son more desirable to kiss. The truffle, due to its rarity and musky aroma, has long 
been bel ieved to arouse the palate and the body. 

This interesting variety of aphrodisiacs can be prepared and assembled into a 
romantic meal. For instance, one delightful combination could be Oysters au 
Parmesan for an appetizer and for the main course Lobster Thermidor, comple-
mented by asparagus with cashews. For a cocktail , try the Blue Velvet Champagne 
or the Red-Hot Cocktail , and for the last course of the meal, try making sonne deli-
cious chocolate mousse bars.

Tantra: Controlling your 
desire to hit the spot

synchronized with your parmer so 
that you feel a connection to one 
another. Light some candles, burn 
incense and massage each others' 
bodies with sweetly scented oils to 
get in the mood, and do it for at least 
20 minutes. Once you're both warm 
and fuzzy. try sitting cross-legged, 
back to back. Without any cues, 
breathe normally, with each of you 
becoming more and more aware of 
your own and the other's breathing, 
and the depth and frequency of it. 
Begin to synchronize it. Keep your 
eyes open, though; falling asleep is 
not the goal here. After you're sure 
you're in sync, begin to feel fo r each 
other's fingertips, touchi ng lightly, 
slowl y. Explore the arms and hands, 
but keep the breath synchronized. 
Turn toward each other and touch 
more and more of each other's bod-
ies. Once facing, find eye contact 
and keep it. Keep kissing controlled 
and soft, but deep, pausing for 
breath together when you need it. 
Try literally breathing in and out of 
one another, keeping eye contact. 
The point is to feel and sustain a con-
nection with your parmer during sex. 

The position you may use to 
keep ulrimate contact with one 
another is the man sitting with his 
legs in a butterfly position (cross-
legged will do if this is impossible), 
while the woman sits on top, wrap-
ping her legs around the man into 

the same position, and Keeping the 
hands running continually all over 
the body. Will you achieve orgasm 
in 'this position? Maybe, maybe not. 
It's not the point. Valentine's Day is 
a day of love, and what better way to 
express it than to completely envel-
op your lover in your embrace, 
breath deeply with him/her and 
touch each other in every way possi-

b�e? Assuming you either come in 
this position, or you switch to anoth-
er such as missionary, when you 
come, try to keep eye contact. 
Closing your eyes is like shutting out 
your lover. You might as well be 
masturbating. 

Have a giorious Valentine's Day,

these books with your lover, com-
municate what you each like and 
don 't like and tell each other what 
you want. There are also videos 
available on Tantric sex, and even if 
you end up with some silly porn with 
Indian-sounding music playing in 
the background, at least the good 
laugh you get will relax you and put 
you in the mood. Deep belly laugh-
ter with your lover is a great way to 
create a cOlUlection with one anoth-
er. Try that before sex. Trust me, it 
will help.

Long Beach shuts 
down Tritons late 

Volleyball: Tritons still looking for first win 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

On the verge of an upset after 
controlling the tempo for the first 
three quarters, the No. 14 UCSD 
women's water polo team gave up 
five unanswered goals, allowing 
No. 5 Cal State Long Beach to 
escape with a 9-4 home victory Feb. 
12. 

The Tritons' (1-5) offense dic-
tated play in the first half as goals 
from senior drivers Jessica Wong 
and Tobi Lyman, combined with a 
score off a steal by sophomore two-
meter Brina Nordstrom, gave 
UCSD a 3-2 lead at halftime. 

Cal State Long Beach stormed 
back, however, fueled by Cassie 
Azevedo's two goals early in the 
fourth perwd to seal the victory for 
the 4gers. With the loss, the 
Tritons now stand 1-5 for the year, 
while the 4gers move up to 5-1. All 
of UCSD's opponents so far have 
been ranked in the top 20 national-
ly. 

seconds left in the period. 
After Triton sophomore two-

meter Natalie Hockett scored her 
second goal of the match with I 
minute, 44 seconds left in the third 
period to knot things up at four 
apiece, the 4gers retook the lead 
just 3 i seconds later to head into 
the final period with a 5 -4 advan-
tage. 

Azevedo notched her second 
and third goals of the match at the 
4:3 1 and 2 :29 maries of the fourth 
quarter, while her teammates added 
two more points before the final 
whistle. Drue Wawrzynski also 
earned two goals for the 4gers, 
while goaltender Bri Hawkins made 
two stops on the day. Freshman 
goalie Kim Hockett picked up four 
saves between the pipes for UCSD. 

"Long Beach State had some 
good outside shooters, but we were 
playing good offense in the first 
half by making opporrunities for 
ourselves, like Brina [Nordstrom)s 
steal, instead of waiting for things 
to happen," Sanders said. 

conljn~d from page :l0 
Jonathan Acosta led the 

Bruins with 15 kills, while team-
mate Brennan Prahler had 10 
kills and four blocks. On the 
other side of the net, Triton 
sophomore outside hitter Mike 
Reuter and senior outside hitter 
Luke Honnette had eight kills 
each, and Reuter added seven 
digs. 

UCLA came away with a 
straight set win over the Tritons, 
but UC Irvine was not so lucky. 
UCSD managed to give the 
Anteaters a scare, almost upset-
ting the No. 10 team. It took all 
five games for UC Irvine to 
secure the win and it was close 
throughout most of the match. In 
the first game, UC Irvine stayed 
JUSt ahead of UCSD before 
pulling away late in the game. 
The Tritons managed to cut the 
Anteater lead to 22-20, but UC 
Irvine didn't allow much more 
from the Tritons, winning the 
first game 30-23. 

Game two was a tight one as 
well, with t~e teams !m0tted up 

17-17 at one point. The Tritons 
had a lead of 22 -17 before the 
Anteaters tied it back up at 24. 
Finally, UCSD managed to put 
the game away with a 30-28 final 
score. 

In a decisive third game, the 
two teams were tied again as late 
as 27 points apiece. The Tritons 
came through in the clutch as 
Reuter notched a kill and they 
took advantage of a UC Irvine 
blocking and hitting error to win 
the third game, 30-27. 

With a 2-1 game advantage, 
UCSD was poised to take the 
match and upset a very talented 
team, but the Anteaters would not 
quit. UC Irvine mostly led in the 
fourth game until the Tritons tied 
it up at 15 -15. UC Irvine regained 
the lead with a 25-21 advantage, 
but UCSD went on a 5 -1 run to 
even the score at 26. The Tritons 
were four points away from that 
elusive first win, but the Anteaters 
got their four points first and 
forced a fifth game with 3 30-26 
Win . 

After four games of tied 

scores and close finis hes, the fifth 
game was surprisingly anticli-
mactic as UC Irvine dominated . 
The final score in game five was 
15-9 and the Anteaters won the 
match three games to two. 
UCSD managed to keep its 
attack percentages pretty even 
with its opponent's until the final 
game, when the Tritons hit .000, 
compared to .438 from the 
Anteaters. 

Senior outside hitter Adam 
Toren led the Tritons with 20 
kills and six digs. Honnette 
added 16 kills, Reuter had 14 
kills and senior middle blocker 
Adam Rusch contributed 12 . 
Senior libero Dickens Tai 
notched a team-high 17 digs in 
the match. 

Despite the losses, UCSD held 
their own against an MPSF foe 
and did not let the Bruins run 
away with an easy win. 

This week, the Tritons return 
home to face off against Cal 
State Northridge and UC Santa 
Barbara on Feb. 18 and Feb. 19, 
respectively. 

"We had a good first half, capi-
talizing on our cOlmter-opporcuni-
ties, but the second half got away 
from us," UCSD head coach Larry 
Sanders said. "It seemed like the 
referees were kicking us out more 
often than they needed to." 

Following Wawrzynski's goal to 
get Cal State Long Beach on the 
board early in the second period, 
Nordstrom made a great steal in 
the 4gers' zone and curned that into 
a 3 -I lead for the Tritons at the 4:04 
mark. Azevedo scored at 2:29 to cut 
Cal State Long Beach's deficit to 
one before the half. 

Basketball: UCSD faces tough schedule 

T he jump in ejections resulted 
in Cal State Long Beach scoring 
five goals in the last seven man-up 
opporcunities, each of which went 
unanswered by the UCSD offense. 

After five scoreless minutes in 
the first quarter, Lyman and Wong 
got things cooking for the Tritons, 
giving UCSD a 2-0 lead in less than 
40 seconds . Lyman scored the 
opening goal at 1:35 while Wong 
found the back of the net wi th 59 

"We realized today that in the 
first half we can beat anybody, 
which will help us when we play 
Loyola Marymorit and other tough 
teams later on," Sanders said. 
"Now, we just have to play the 
whole game that way." 

UCSD returns to Canyonview 
Pool to take on Cal State San 
Bernardino at 4 p.m. on Feb. 19. 

coruin~d from page :l0 
Wildcats were unwilling to allow 
UCSD to make things interest-
ing. The team scored the first 
two points of the half to push its 
lead to double-digits and never 
led by less than that. The Tritons, 
who shot 3 solid .500 from the 
field, including .426 from long 
distance, couldn't make up any 
ground, and Chico State pushed 
its advantage to 20 with fewer 
than eight minutes to play, with 
the Tritons unable to make a 
game out of it.

The Wildcats were led by 
reserve Jason Van Eck, who scored 
a game-high 19 points in 13 min-
utes of play. Guard Scott Land had 
12 points and center Will Bonner 
added 10 on 5-for-5 shooting 
from the field . The Triton scoring 
attack was less balanced. Led by a 
trio of freshman guards, the 
Tritons were unable to keep it 
close with Chico State. Allard had 
a team-high 16 points, while 
Hatch notched eight points, and 
Joey Toboni added eight points in 
eight minutes of play. Sophomore 

forward Parker Berling and 
sophomore forward Zackary 
Craddock tied for the team high 
with four rebounds, while Berling 
added seven points and Craddock 
contributed five points. 

UCSD recurns to action on 
Feb. 16, traveling to take on 
CCAA leader Cal State San 
Bernardino for a 7:30 p.m. 
match-up. The team will then 
play its second road game of the 
week as they travel to Cal State 
Monterey Bay for a 7:30 p.m. 
game on Feb. 19.

Chico State ends men's 
basketball winning streak 

By JOE TEVELOWRZ 
Staff Writer 

T he Tritons' men's basketball 
team split a pair of weekend home 
games at RIMAC Arena, losing to 
Chico State on Feb. 11 before 
rebounding for a victory over Cal 
State Stanislaus on Feb. 12. 

T he 82-66 loss to Chico State 
( 14-6 overa ll , 9-4 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association) 
ended the Tritons' three-game 
winning streak. whi le the 71-68 
Feb. 12 victory gave UCSD ( lO-
II overall, 6-8 CCAA) a ~eason 
sweep of its series with Cal State 
Stanislaus (4-17 overall, 2-12 
CCAA). 

After the Tritons' 71-70 over-
time victory over Cal State 
Stanislaus in their first meeting of 
the season , everyone was expect-
ing a similarly exciting game. The 
Tritons unintentionally let that 
happen. After going into halftime 
with a two-point lead in a tough 
bade-and-forth game, UCSD was 
able to open its intermi sion 
advantage to a 10-point cushion 
with just over seven minutes left 
to play. However, the team nearly 
let the lead evaporate after 
Warriors Ross Green's three-
pointer cut the deficit to one 
point with five seconds to play. 
Sophomore guard Mark 
Lewkowitz was able to calmly sink 
two free throws, and a missed 
three-pointer by Warrior point 
guard Jeremiah King at the 
buzzer sealed the victory for the 
Tritons. 

eCSD was able to hold on 
thanIcs to some Warrior miscues at 
the free-throw line. Shooting only 
.630 from the line, and a subpar 
.273 three-point percentage, the 

Warriors couldn't capitalize on 
their 32-23 rebounding advantage, 
to pull out a victory. UCSD was 
able to hold its own thanks to a 
stout .758 free-throw percen tage 
and .524 field goal percentage. 

Freshman guard Andrew 
Hatch led all scorers with 16 
points and added three assists, a 
team-high six rebounds and a 
game-high three steals. Fellow 
freshman guard Clint Allard 
added 11 points and a game-high 
five assists. Sophomore forward 
Parker Berling had 15 points, 
shooting 2-for-3 from the field 
and 11-for- 12 from the free-
throw line, and sophomore guard 
Robby Peters had 10 points and 
three rebounds off the bench to 
round out the Tritons in double-
digits. 

Forward Kavin Young led the 
Warriors with 15 points on 7-for-
8 shooting from the fie ld. Green 
had 14 points, going 3-for-4 from 
long di tance, while King had 
seven points and tied AJlard for 
the game high with five assists. 

Against Chico State, the 
Tritons found themselve out-
worked on the boards and unable 
to overcome their 20 turnovers as 
they watched their winning streak 
come to an end. The team revert-
ed to its bad habit of falling 
behind early, down 17-0 six min-
utes into the game. UCSD scored 
its first points of the game at the 
12 minute, 31 second mark, which 
cued a 10-0 run on their part. 
After scoring the final three 
points of the half, the Tritons 
found themselves down a man-
ageable eight points. 

In the second half, the

Following a near-upset of No. 

10-ranked UC Irvine in five 
games on Feb. 9, the UCSD men's 
volleyball team fell in straight sets 
to the UCLA Bruins, the best 
team in the nation, on Feb. II. 

The two losses came at the end 
of a five-game road trip for the 
Tritons (0-10 overall, 0-9 
Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation). The loss to UCLA 
was a tough one for UCSD as the 
team faced the No. 1 team in the 
country on its home court. The 
Tritons lost, 30-15, 30-24, 30-21, 
panly due to an attack percentage 
of .168 for the match. In the first 
game, UCSD suffered a -.038 stat 
while UCLA shot 0308, leading to 
a 1-0 lead for the Bruins. 

The second game was the most 
promising howing by the Tritons 
as they improved to a .324 per-
centage compared to the Bruins' 
mark of .421. UCLA finished the 
match by outhitting UCSD, .407 
to .171 . The three-game victory 
was UCLA's 12th win overall and 
their eighth in the MPSF. The 
Bruins have only one loss so far 
this season.

Men's tennis storms through Broncos to 8-1 vidory 
Tritons pick apart Cal Poly Pomona with perfect singles competition 

By ANGELA UN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Before the onset of weekend rain, 
the Tritons were able to capture 
their first dual-match victory with a 
dominating 8- 1 win over rival Cal 
Poly Pomona on Feb. 10. 

The Tritons' (1-1) oruy loss came 
at No.1 doubles, where the Cal Poly 
Pomona (0-1) brothers team, Andy 
and AJan Chang, quickly blanked 
freshman duo Eric Rubens and 
Blake Me.ister, 8-0. At No. 2 dou-
bles, UCSD junior Brent Molden 
and ophomore Seth Spector defeat-
ed the Broncos' Sebastian Torres 
and Tony De Hierro in a convincing 
8- 1 win. 

"We learned from our doubles 
loss that we really have to be mental-
ly prepared and ready to play every 
match," senior captain Bryan Swatt 
sa id. " s a player, you have to 
respect every single opponent, no 
matter who you're playing." 

The Tritons had a 2-1 lead going 
into singles matches and were able 
to capi tal i7c on the win, with aU six 
singles Illat,he ending in straight-
et victorie.,. watt breezed through 

an easy victory again t Andy hang, 
6- 1, 6-2, while Molden outplayed 
the Bronco's Alan Chang in straight 
sets, 6-3,6-3 . 

The highlight of the match came 
at o. 4 singles when pector and 

Torres battled for UCSD to take vic-
tories in all sets across the singles 
lineup. Spector was able to narrowly 
pull out the first set, 7-6, and resist 
Torres' comeback effort by closing 
out the match, 7-5. 

In past years, Cal Poly Pomona 
was considered a strong rival, but the 
Broncos' tennis program has been 
steadily decHning, with last year 
marking the first time in 12 years the 
team dipped below .500. 

"Going into the match, we knew 
that we were favored, but we knew 
we would have to play confidently 
and aggressively in order to win," 
Swatt said. "We've had some tough 
matches against Pomona in the past, 
so our goal was to stay focused." 

The Tritons, who struggled 
against Azusa Pacific University on 
Feb. 5, came out fired up for their 
first victory. For many on the team, 
this was a good look at how varied 
competition can be in league. The 
Tritons, led by lone senior Swatt, 
acquired four freshmen this year, 
who are beginning to see the spec-
trunl of competition they will rnce. 

"Our strength has to be our 
desire to improve and our weakness 
has to be our inexperience in duaJ-
match play," UCSD coach Eric 

teidlmayer said. "In doubles we will 
continue to improve, but right now 
we are not at the level needed to 
make a serious impact against the 

good teams. This will have to be 
something that we reaUy work on in 
the next few months. " 

The Tritons hope to recapture 
the same luck that prompted last 
year's amazing run to the NCAA 
Division II Championships. The 
team lost many seniors to gradua-
tion, but its new freshmen are eager 
to help live up to last year's legacy. 

"We are young, and we need to 
learn quicldy in order to position 
ourselves for the playoffs, " 
Steidlmayer said. "We have a diffi-
cult schedule ahead, and need to 
really make ourselves better in the 
coming weeks and months." 

Next up for the Tritons will be a 
Feb. 17 match against Loyola Mary-
mount in Los Angeles. The Lions 
are currently 0-3 in league play.
