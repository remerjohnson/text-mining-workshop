Donors' Estates Face Litigation 
MONEY: Recent cases 
show that donations to 
colleges are not assured 
KI-Mln Sung 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Chronicle of Higher 
Education , a news source for col-
lege and university fat.:ulty, staff 
and administrators. stated recent-
ly that a number of universities 
and charities across the nation 
have sued the estates of donors 
for failure to make a promised 
monetary gift. 

In these cases, the payment 
was defaulted on. after the death 
of the donor because the benefac-

tor 's estate decided to rescind on 
the pledge. 

In 1990, prominent business-
man Richard H. Barclay pledged 
$1 million to construt.:t a $17 mil -
lion auditorium at UC Irvine that 
was to be named in honor of him. 
However, Barclay died a few 
years later - $600,000 short of 
meeting the full payment. 

The Barclay pledge was inte-
gral to the 4 .5 million needed 
from a pri vate fundraising cam-
paign to pay for the auditoriulll. 
The remaining monies that would 
pay for the building would come 
from public money. Construction 
began based on the fulfillment of 
thi s pledge; uel subsequently 

faced a large deficit. 
To altain payment of this debt .. 

the UCI Foundation and the ity 
of Irvine sued Barclay 's widow, 
Marjorie A. Barclay. The case 
concluded in an undisclosed set-
tlement. 

UCSD has never faced a simi-
lar situalion. 

Marlene Shaver, director of 
information and financial sy tems 
for development and universi ty 
relations at U SO, said thai law-
suit s are normally avoided. 

"You just don 't typically sue

New Law 
Allows Tax 
Deduction 
AB 1613: Governor Pete 
Wil on ign bill which 
will permit student loan 
interest to be written off 
By Erika Snider 
News Editor 

Governor Pete Wil on signed 
Assembly Bill 1613 into law last 
Thursday. The bill will allow 
California students to deduct the 
interest they pay on their student 
loans from their Slate taxe ·. 

Assemblyman Jack COil (D-
Altadena) spon ored the bill . which is 
known as the " Higher Education 
Affordability Act." 

He said he hopes it will make a 
university education more affordable 
for middle- and lower-income stu-
dents. 

"AB 1613 provides much-needed 
tax relief for students and their par-
ents and will encourage more students 
to go to college," Scott said in a state-
ment released by hi ' office on 
Thursday. 

The new law would make it pos-
sib le for students to deduct the inter-
est accrued on their student loans 
from their taxes for the first five 
years of the interest payments. 

The law - which will take effect 
on Jan. I, 1999 - will permit a 
maximum deduction of $1 ,000 for 
the tudent 's 1998 taxes and will 
eventually allow a maximum deduc-
tion of $2,500 by 2001. 

These restrictions keep with the 
lim i tat ions et forth by the 
Taxpayer Relief Act, which the fed -
eral government approved in 1997. 
Thi s act also established a simi lar 
tax deduction, in which students 
will be allowed to deduct the inter-
est from their loans from their fed-
era l taxes. 

Despite a five-percent decrease in 
student fees this year, UC fees more 
than doubled this decade, jumping 
from $1,820 in 1990 to $4.022 in 
1998. 

"High tuition and limited financial 
aid has placed college out of the 
financial grasp of many 
Californians," Scott said. 

Gail Evans, one of St.:ott' pokes-
people, also said that this bill is part 
of Scott 's effort to make education 
more affordable for tudent in 
California. 

"This is a high priority for the 
Assemblyman," she said. "We are 
always looking at the is ue so 
Californians can have better access to 
schools."

UCSD Awarded $1.4 Million Grant 
The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) has 

selected UCSD to receive a $1.4 million four·year 
grant to enhance undergraduate science education for 
disadvantaged students. 

The new funds will allow the university to continue 
working with high schools through science outreach 
programs . In addition, the funds will allow UCSD to 
continue helping undergraduates through science and 
curriculum development support programs. 

HHMI has awarded UCSD $5 million in grants since 
1989. 

Science Faculty Members 
Recognized for Their Work 

Six UCSD science faculty members are recipients 
of recent honors or awards for scientific achievement. 

Dr. Kit Pogliano, assistant biology professor, was 
named as the recipient of a 1998 Searle Scholars 
Program award and as the winner of the Beckman 
Young Investigator Award. Pogliano, who specializes in 
bacterial cell biology. is studying a step in the spore for· 
mation pathway of the soil bacterium Bacillus subtillis. 

Dr. Brian Maple, the director of UCSD's Institute 
for Pure and Applied Physical Sciences and the Center 
for Interface and Materials Science, has been select· 
ed to receive a Humboldt Research Award for Senior 
U.S. Sciences. Maple 's academic research deals with 
superconductivity, magnetism and other phenomena 
exhibited by complex materials. 

Assistant Biology Professor Raffi Aroian and 
Assistant Chemistry and Biochemistry Professor 
Nathaniel Finney are both recipients of the 1998·99 
Hellman Faculty Fellowship Award. 

Aroian studies the link that exists between cellular 
structure and cellular fu nction. Finney's research has

UCSD Receives Funds to Aid 
Students in East and South San 
Diego County 

UCSD Early Academic Outreach has received an 
$800.000 grant from the U.S. Department of 
Education to provide academic and informational ser· 
vices to 600 middle·school students and their parents 
in the areas of Lemon Grove, Spring Valley and EI 
Cajon. 

The grant will help fund the "Talent Search 
Program,· which is designed to encourage and moti· 
vate students who might not otherwise attend college 
due to limited income or lack of information about col· 
lege. 

Research indicates that, as early as the eighth 
grade, many low·income and potential first·generation 
college students believe that attaining a college 
degree is not a realistic goal. Thus, the program will 
focus on early intervention in sixth through ninth 
grade, as well as on supporting students through high 
school graduation and enrollment in postsecondary 
education .

4 OPINION The UCSO Guardian Monday, Seplember 28, 1998 

PINI 

Liberal arts) though often overlooked 
and taken for granted, are in no way 

of less value than the sciences 
By Marc Comer 
Opinion Editor 

Many scienc.:e majors at UCSO - those 
in engineering, math. chemistry, biology 
and physics - may lind it difficult to imag-
ine why anyone would choose a major in the 
soft sciences and, in tum, a life of unem-
ployment and wonhlessness. Reasonably 
enough, many wonder why any student 
would spend four years and thousands of 
dollars on something that will ultimately 
lead to nothing. 

Of course. · 37 pereent of sludents at 
UCSD have non-science majors and would 
most likely not agree with this analysis 
(UCSD Summary of Statistics Table, 1997). 

Non-sc iem:e lields at UCSO include the 
arts, humanities and social sdences. often 
referred to as liberal arts. The gamut of lib-
eral ans spans from psychology and eco-
nomics to visual arts and ethnic studies. 

UCSD is predominately a research-ori -
ented university. Liberal arts are, at best, 
neglected. Typically, they are undervalued. 

In a society that is increasingly obsessed 
with scienti fic advam:cment, the study of 
liberal arts is taken for granted. We are mov-
ing away from the exploration of intrinsic 
human qualities and talents and stepping 
into a world overrun with technology. While 
the systematic study of science is a relati ve-
Iy new advancement, creating things of 
beauty and passing down culture through 
stories is as old as language itself. 

The goa l of liberal art , like the goal of 
science, is to further people's comfort and 
knowledge. Sc.:ience majors hope that by 
easing pain. designing new forms of trans-
portation and discovering the way things 
work. they will ultimately make this world a 
better, more convenient place to live. 

Liberal arts majors hope that by improv-
ing communication. creating new forms of 
entertainment and figuring out why people 
think the way they do. lhey will ultimately 
make this world a better. more enjoyable 
place to live. In the end . the goals are the 
same. How we ac.:hieve those goals dif-
fers entirely. 

Sciem:e majors look for definite, black-
and-white answers. while liberal arls majors 
are satislied deciphering the gray. In gener-
al. liberal art s majors improve relationships 
between individuals: sc ience majo rs 
improve relationships between individuals 
and things. Unfortunately, in our materiali s-
tic world, things often take priority and lib-
eral arts suffer. 

The marketability of liberal arts majors is 
often questionable, but the value should 
never be. Where would the world be without 
literature, history and language? Where 
would il be without teachers, busi-
nessmen and artists? Who

Liberal arts contribute nothing of 
substantial value to society and are a 

burden and a waste of time 
By Jeff Hinrichs 
Contribut ing Opinion Writer 

Some areas of study, pani <.: ularl y those 
c.:ategorized as lhe liberal :ms. are a com-
plete wasle of lime and a burden on soc.: iety. 

Some subjec.:ts that would fit these <.: rite-
ria are history. political scienc.:e, linguistics. 
visual arts and literature. College degrees in 
these subject areas generally lead to jobs 
leaching liberal arts to other people. There 
are no other realistic options available for 
graduates. 

I have nothing against liberal arts in 
moderation. Being a well-rounded 

studenl is a good thing. It·s 
amazing how some peo-

ple completely lack 

the most rudimentary knowledge. However. 
general knowledge is all that is needed and 
notlhe ridiculous and w nvoluted arguments 
lhal the average liberal arts professor · puts 
forth. 

No one will ever ask you to compare and 
c.:ontrast the social construc.:tion of gender in 
19th c.:entury Americ.:a with the Women's 
Rights Movement of the 1970s or any other 
random and useless question. 

In general, liberal arts cure no diseases. 
discover no new energy sources, manufac.:-
ture no automobiles and build no bridges. In 
fact , they produce nothing of substantial 
value to beller the physical living conditions 
of the average person. On the other hand, 
liberal arts majors do produce loads of excit-
ing romance novels that are available at the 
local supermarket. Where would we be 
without this tine literature? 

The economy is booming right now, so 
most people, including liberal arts majors. 
will probably find a job, although it may be 
low paying. 

Remember a few years ago when things 
were not so peachy? On the evening news, 
there were stories about how college gradu-
ates had ex treme diftk uhy finding jobs. The 
media always c.:hose to do stories about 
unemployed college graduates who majored 
in something quite worthless. 

I remember one story in which the per-
son being proliled majored in a useless sub-
ject like art history. While thi s may be an 
interesting intellectual pursuit for some, it is 
hard to base a career around it except by 
teaching others. 

People like this have no right to whine 
about being unemployed. They chose to 
waste their time in coll ege, and now they are 
paying for it. Unfortunately: the media are 
not very bright either. It seems that they 
never bother to interview someone with a 
more promi ing future for these stories, but 
you would expect that from the media. 

One might argue that even if a liberal arts 
major isn 't helpful in the job market, the lib-

eral arts do teach you to look at

HIDDEN BENEFITS FOUND AT THE GUARDIAN 
COMMENTARY: The 
pay is low, the work is 
time-consuming. but 
the benefits are great 
By Walt Dickinson 
Editor in Ch ief 

The hours are long. Really long. 
The pay is tiny. Microscopic.: . The 
respect from the community varies 
from abundant praise to bitter di s-
gust to none at all. 

The machines break , the staff 
<.:omplains, deadlines are nOl met. 
nasty lellers are read. page layouts 
arc lost, graphics are latc. the press 
operators comp lai n and nobody 
reads it anyway. 

So why does a fourth-y ear 
Reve lle student who is nowhere in 
sight of graduating choose to invest 
90 percent of his time and energy 
into managing such a c.: haotic work 
environment? 

Simply, it is the greatest job on 
campus. 

The people are fri endly and 
interes ting. there·s never a dull 
moment . yo u become involved in a 
wide array of campus issues and 
develop skills that you never knew 
you possessed. 

On lOp of all that. working for 
the Guardian allows students to 
enlighten the minds of the c.:ampus 
community and to debate the issues 
that affect us all. While the staff

Some may fall to 
see the glamour of 
working until 5 a.m., 
then driving to the 
press operators in EI 
Cajon only to find 
them closed, falling 
asleep in the car for 
an hour until they 
open, then driving 
back to the 
Guardian and going 
straight back to 
work. It is quite a 
rush though. 
outside of the Gllardiall goes a lung 
way toward tyi ng our campus 
IOgether and providing a forum for 
communication. 

Representing a school the sil.e 
of C ' 0 require · the wlents of a 
di verse group of studelll s. While 
thl!se differing per~pective often 
work in harmony. they occ.:a~iona l ­
Iy contlict and give a false impres-
sion of the collecti ve view of the 
stall. 

In the past. the public percep-
ti on of thc newspaper's va lues has 
been drawn from our few more 
controversial writers . Our reader-
ship occ.:asionally fail s to remember 
that the whole stall has views as 
diverse as the rest of the c.:ampus. 

As a result. in the years that [ 
have been involved with the 
Gllardiall. we have been acc.:used of 
being too conservative, then the 
next yea r 100 liberal. We have been 
accused of ignori ng racially diverse 
forms of on-<.:amp us entertainment 
and, at the same time, not covering 
mainstream rnu ic. 

Accusations aside. we have the 
pri vilege of covering the entire 
campus. In doing so, twice a week, 
we tend to get a little worn out. 
However. the franti c.: pace of the 
paper 's producti on is purt of. what 
attracts some of us to Ihe job. 

Somc may fail to see the glam-
our of working until 5 a.m .. then 
driving to the press operators in EI 
Cajon onl y to lind them closed, 
falli ng asleep in thc car for an hour 
until they open, then driving bac.:k 
to the Guardian and going straight 

oa<.:k to wurk. It is qui te a rush 
though. 

o despite our differences. 
being involved wi th the Guardiall 
is one of the mo,t fulfilling experi-
ences one can have at UCSO. The 
newspaper provides a learning 
environment unlike any other on 
campus. Writing skills are formed 
and polished, photographers learn 
va luable skill s and techniques, 
graphic arti ts gain experienc.:e and 
edi tors develop leadership skills. 
Of course it doesn' t hurt that every-
one gelS paid. 

Most importantly. the Guardian 
is an educ.:at ion in itself that UCSD 
slUdents won ' t lind in any depart-
ment. Personally, [ feel this experi-
ence will be a greater benefit 10 me 
than the remainder of my educa-
tion. 

I have been proud to participate 
in the produc.:tion of the paper these 
past three years. and I look forward 
to what we will accomplish in the 
coming months. 

Remember, thi s publication 
exists to spread knowledge to the 
students, staff and faculty. So 1 
encourage everyone in the UCSO 
community to <.:ontribute to whal is 
essentially your campus newspaper.

Science majors might argue lhat 
the average person only needs a 
mll1imal amounl at liheral arts 
knowledge . Once someone can 
read, wrile and has a bit of general 
knowledge. Ihere is no need tor 
more. But similarly, only a minimal 
amount ot math , chemistry and 
biology is really needed for anyone 
outside of the ~ciences . 

Still some would argue Ihal 
majors such as Greek literature.

teach regurgitation 
Continued from page 4 
issues in a different light. This would 
be greal if it were true, but my expe-
rience has been the opposite. 

Essay graders in liberal arts 
courses like to grade papers lhat arc 
basically lecture regurgitation. As 
astonishing as it sounds, I occasion-
ally worked diligenlly on an essay. I 
took a decent amount of time to 
ponder the issues being discussed 
and to answer honest ly the ques-
tions being asked. One would think 
that Ihi s would resu lt in a bener 
grade - nOl true. What usually 
happens IS either Ihe grader just di s-

.. 

visual arts and art history are use-
less. This simply is not so. True, 
the market va lue of these majors 
is quite less than electrical engi-
neering or biology, but they do 
have their place, even if it is 
obscure. 

While many science majors are 
in it for the m ney, many liberal 
arts majors are in it for Ihe impact 
they hope to make on Ihe world . 
This is nOl to say that each liberal 
arts major hopes to be the next 

Jetter~on . Hemingway or Picasso. 
Mo~t liberal arls majors, however. 
chose their major because they love 
it, regardless of the meager amount 
of money it may provide. 

The impact Ii bcral arls majors 
have on the world is overlooked. 
Everyone know~ when a new drug 
is developed or a bridge is built. 
The i !lIpacI of the sciences is seen 

agrees wilh me, or Ihe grader sees 
that I have taken a posilion t.:Onlrary 
to the official po!>ition of Ihe da~s. 

In addition, some liberal arts 
TAs are so incompetent they t:annot 
understand a profound idea when 
Ihey read it, so they just dismi ss it 
as irrelevant or unsubstantialed by 
the tex!. A word to the wise: Do not 
wrile what you think, but what you 
think they want to hear. 

I have finally comp leted all of 
my general education require-
ment!>. ~o I can share my ex peri-
ences in Ihe liberal arts without 
repercussions. I took all of these 
t: la!>ses on a pass/tail basi!>. and I 
honestly should have fail ed them 
all. The!>e classe~ had extensi ve 
reading IiSb. but I neither read nor 
buught any ot the buoks.

The UCSD Guardian 

The goal of liberal 
arts, like the goal of 
science, is to 
further the comfort 
and knowledge of 
people. 
when new cars are designed or a 
life is saved. The)'e things instantly 
make our lives easier. 

Liberal ans majors produce 
less langible things thaI arc taken 
for granted - adve rti semenls, 
constitulions and laws. better 
communica tion, pedagogy, the 
layout of a city and improved race 
relations. 

Simply looking at the mar-
ketahility of a major is nOl a good 
judgment of it~ value. II mar-
ketahilit y was all Ihal mallered 

In general, liberal 
arts cure no 
diseases, discover 
no new energy 
sources, 
manufacture no 
automobiles and 
build no bridges. 

In my liberal arts experi ence, it 
seems that my grades were deter-
mined by the sheer volume of writ-
ing turned in for the midterm!> and 
linals.

everyone would be a computer sci-
ence major - a frighlening 
prospect. 

When looking al the value of a 
major, look at the way il affects the 
world, not ~imp ly at the money it 
wi ll provide. 

Just as the study of medicine 
provides for advancement in the 
medical field, so too docs the study 
of political sc ience create advance-

Illenl~ in government. 
It must also be considered Ihat. 

were it nOl for th e stud y and 
advancement of liberal arts, the 
world would be a horing, bland 
place to li ve. Lines of com munica-
tion wou ld decay. Art , music. and 
writing would desist. guvernments 
would collapse and science majors 
would he alone wilh nothing to do 
bUI program their TI-H5s. 

Science maj r~ , though often

just wrote down everything I could 
remember the profes!>or talking 
about in lecture. I thought there 
was no way this strategy would 
work. but il did. 

This was the point at which I 
lost most of my respet:t for the lib-
eral arts. It apparenlly requires very 
lillie effort to pass a liberal arts

accused of having poor or no social 
skills, are not socially inept. They 
are' simply more concerned with 
how things work than how people 
inleract. They still need languages 
to survive. 

In the argument of which is 
more valuable, liberal ans or sci-
ences, the answer is obvious . 
Neither. Who can argue that the 
language of French is any more 
valuable than the language of 
math? Liberal ans majors and sci -
ence majors alike are heading in 
the same direc lion, no mailer how 
different our methods. To achieve 
our goal we must respect each 
other, even if the money's differ-
ent. 

Besi des. withoul literature , 
movies, arl and clolhing, how 
would science majors spend all of 
their money') 

ule. just barely pass them all and 
get two more degrees at graduation 
lime. A degree only requires a 2.0 
GPA in Ihe major, right'! I am nOl 
sure or what use Ihese degrees 
would b". especia ll y with such low 
grades, but it would still be flln to 
hang the degrees on the wall for a 
good laugh. 

It i . sUl1>rising that no clever slu-
dents have tried to pull all this stun!. 
However. this trick is on ly suitable 
for profes ional 'Iackers, so please 
do not try this at home, kids. 

While Illany people lind liberal 
arts classes interesting, the prob-
lem with liberal ans classes is thaI 
Ihey arc easy to pass. Furthermore. 
they have no practical application 
in society and lead to unemploy-
ment.

Abuse Towards Employees 
Affects Students 
Editor: 

Students - ha ve you had a prohlem in 
receiving servit:es from campus departments '! 
Well. one orthe rea!>ons could be that employ-
ees arc being kept from providing you with 
the best of servi t:e because of poor 'upervi-
sion and managemenl probkms. Mine is a 
case in point. 

When I graduated from UCSD 10 years 
ago I decided thal I wan led to work for the 
university helping students. For the past four 
years I have enjoyed being Ihe undergraduate 
coordinator for one of Ihe campus depart -
ments and have been suct:essful in helping 
many students. However. I have encountered 
serious problems that hinder employees from 
providing quality service to students. These 
are problems of abuse, mismanagement , mi s-
appropriation of funds, favoritism and cover 
ups. These problems cause low employee 
morale. formal complaints, a high lurnover 
rate and employees going out on stress leave. 
Hostile work environments sueh as these have 
an adverse effect on the students. 

In the past several weeks I have allempted 
to bring these problems to the anention of 
higher management but without success. It 
seems that no one wants to "rock the boat." 
To me, quality services to the students are a 
priority and that compels me to speak up and 
take a risk . Lasl July, in giving his State of 
the UniversilY, Chancellor Dynes mentioned 
how he wants to help empl yees and to elim-
inale these Iypes of working environments. I 
am allempting to meel wilh him to give him 
the speci ti cs of these i s~ ues for hi s consider-

Believe it or not, this ad is just a private attempt to find new and interesting people. We're a rag-tag 
collection of off-beat individualists, thoroughly devoted to making the most of life as we possibly can . 
Part of that effort includes finding new people--to learn from, to hang out with, to conquer the 
world ... you know. " you're like us, you want to do everything, to try everything, to understand 
everything. There is so much to do, and so few lives to do it in. The only times we're bored is when 
we're stuck doing things we don't want to do. Left to our own. we'll tum sand into castles, napkins 
into unified-field theories, and potatoes into small withering statues wearing funny hats . The 
common thread amongst us is something that is, unfortunately, very rare: the desire to know the 
truth above all other considerations. To master reality, you have to know reality. If you want to bend 
the world to your will , you need to know how the world works. Even if the truth is not what you want 
to hear, it is better to know it than to deny it. Do you believe in mystical energies, and other things 
which are inherently beyond rationality? If so, don't call us. We don't invent e~cuses for the un-
known-today's magic is tomorrow's science. Do you lee I your we~are and happiness are anyone's 
responsibility but your own? If so, don't call us! We believe everyone is responsible for his or her 
own we~are . Helping others should be a choice and a pleasure, never an obligation. Are you bored 
with people who don't see a fraction of the world you do? You're wondering whether you can 
bio-engineer a cow that makes chocolate milk, and they're wonied whether or not their shampoo 
manufacturer uses animal testing. You're staying up late to stretch time, and they're drinking beer to 
kill time. You're dressed for comfort and personal aesthetics, and they're herding with the fashion 
clones. "this sounds familiar. perhaps you should be hanging with us instead. Our interests run 
the gamut from cooking to high-tech research. from sky-diving to composing music, from chia 
shoes to strip ouija. We may not be here forever, so don't hesitate to contact us--it's a small effort 
considering the possibilities it creates. Email: hello@sifter.org .

California votcr information

docsn't equate to being informed. 

Our voting often parallels fami l-
iarity. We vote more often in popu-
lar races than in less publicized 
ones, and many voters do nO! go to 
the ballot box with answers for all 

guides were sent out la t week. of the questions. 
Flipping through the 126 page. rf, when punching holes on my 
text-filled pamphlet, I thought of ballot. I come across a proposition

order to be well-informed and to I've never heard of any of the can-
vote responsibly in the upcoming didates for insurance commission-
elections. I thought of how I, along er, I den't vote for that ol'lice.

would not spend that time. ble Californians are saying when 

I am glad so few people choo~e they stay at home and watch televi-

Gray Davis' current lead in the race 
for governor wi II decrease. This 
makes it obvious that Democratic 
voters are the group most likely to 
skip the election. 

Rather than encouraging young 
people and disinterested. flighty 
tclevision-commercial watchers to 
join the Democratic party and vote. 
we should cncourage those who 
don't want to read the California 
voter information guide not to. 

Let yuur Japanese friend order 
for you.

who qualify to take part in 
approving our laws and choos-

There is no responsibility to 
vote. There is a responsibility for 
each of us to do what is best for the 

country, for California, for our 
neighborhood. If what is best 
for California this ovember is 
for me to skip over Proposition 
9 and Jet those who know some-ing our leaders is around 21 mil-

lion. Of those 21 million, only 
about 70 percent are registered to 
vote, according to the Federal 
Elections Commission (FEe). 

In past elections, only 60 per-
cent of regi~tcrcd voters cast a vote 
for governor. ~hows the FEe. Local 
elections and propositions are 
passed or defeated with far fewer 
ballots cas!. 

Campaign organizers for this 
year's statewide races say a lower 
voter turnout is possible. 

There arc no statistics about 
how many of those at the ballot box 
have read the voter information 
guide. read a newspaper every now 
and then. or know the first thing 
about the proposition they ju t gave 
a thumbs-up to. 

With the free<.lom of voting 
comes the responsibility of being 
informed enough to do so. Reading 
bumper ~ti ckers and watching .can-

sion on election day - that they 
don't know enough to VOle respon-
sibly. 

More people should <.10 the same 
thing. 

The first time I went to a 
Japanese restaurant . I Ict my 
Japanese friend do all the ordering. 
I didn 't know chopsticks from 
sushi and let my more knowledge-
able friend do all the deciding. 

True. choosing our leaders 
affects more people and morc 
aspects of our daily life than does a 
California roll. And true, we should 
put more effort into learning about 
our laws and leaders than into 
learning about Oriental cuisine. 

Those people who currently 
spend time following and taking 
part in politics call themselves 
Repub·-licans. Polls report, and Los 
Angeles Times research confirms. 
that if fewer people vote, Democrat 

thing about the electric uti lit ies 
industry do the hole-punching, then 
that is what I will do . 

My voting for the state con-
troller or for the justices of the 
supreme coun would be like pick-
ing cards out or a deck. 

Or I could read through the 
vuter guide thm was just delivered 
and learn about the cards. 

Understandably. classes and 
work and television make it hard to 
keep up with politics - learning 
faces and propositions. choosing 
leaders and writing laws. Don' t 
read the pamphlet, concentrate 
instead on homework or on prime 
time televi ion. Or for that malter, 
do nothing. But kcep that attitude 
when it comes to election time and 
<.Ion't bother.

changi ng the program were dis-
cl:ssed, including l:harging a $3-

inat ing the delivery altogether.

"\' ve always viewed Library

make any changes to it." Lowell 
said. "The Library said, 'What 's 
1110re important: delivery or the

Racism Charge Haunts Penn History Department 
CONTROVERSY: African-American graduate student allege discrimination at the hands of a white professor in 1997 
By Ethan Kross 
Daily Pennsylvanian IU. Pennsylvania) 

PH ILADELPHIA, Penn . -
While everyone III Penn 's Hi~(()ry 
Department is talking ahout a black 
graduate student's 1997 racial di\ -
crimination charges against a white 
professor. they certainly aren 't talk-
ing Lo the pres~ . 

Originall y an American 
Civililation grad ~tudenl. third-
year grad studenl Kali Gross t ran~­
ferred into the History Department 
in 1996 after the university termi-
nated lheAmCiv program. Because 
of department policy, she was 
forced to take HisLOry 700 - a 
course designed to teach ti rst-year 
grdduate students how 10 do prima-
ry source research - despite hav-
ing already taken a similar course 
in the AmCiv department. 

In June I Y97, Gros ', who LOok 
History 700 with then-firsl-year 
Professor Margarel Jacob, ti led 
racia l discriminati on charges 
against Jacob after she got a "S+" 
in the class. 

Acco rding to one HislO ry pro-
fessor. members of the department 
are under strict orders not to dis-
cuss any aspects of the case. 
although several prote 'sors com-
mented to rhe Chronicle of Higher 
Educlilio/l for a slOry that ra n two

did not res pond to several e-mail 
over the la~t week. Jacoh abo 
dedim:d 10 commenl . 

"IGro:,s I ca rne and told me thm 
~ h.: thought Jacoh had given her a 
grade hased not on the work shc' d 
donc but that ~he h'ld bcen biased ," 
HIstory Professor and Ihen-HislOry 
Graduate Chairperson Lee 
Cassanelli said in a recent inter-
view with the Chronic/e. 

After reviewing the commenls 
appeari ng on Gross' papers and 
compari ng them wi th those gi ven 
to other students in the class, 
Cassanell i concluded thaI the 
charges were groundless, lhough he 
said that some of Jacob's remarks 
may have been ove rl y aggressi ve. 
the Chronicle reported. 

Consequenlly, Gross brought 
her charges to History Department 
Chairperson Lynn Lees and Schoo l 
of Arts and Sciences Graduate 
Dean Walter Licht , but fai led to 
oblain a decision againsl Jacob.

"We were satisfied 
with what was done 
- it did not hurt the 
professor, and I 
think it was appro· 
priate given what 
happened in the 
course." 

- Vicki Mahaffey 
University of Pennsylvania 

Ombudswoman 

English professor. 
After eight month s, a resolution 

was brought to the execut ive COIll -
minee of the graduale group and 
accepted unanimously. The resolu-
tion st ripped Jacob of all blame and 
allowed for both the grade and 
class to be removed fro m Gross' 
record . 

Whi Ie faculty members arc 
lega ll y forbidden from discus 'ing 
any of the circumstances surround-
ing a student 's grade, administra-
tors sa id they were pleased wi th the 
decision. 

"We were sati sfi ed with what 
was done - it did not hurt the pro-
fessor, and I th ink il was app ropri -
ate given whal happened in the 
course: ' Mahaffey told the 

Chmil icle. 
Whether or not facully agreed 

with the decision is difficult to say. 
umerous faculty memhers 

declined to di scu~~ the issue. citing 
an elTectivc departmental gag rule. 

Prure~so r, also would not say who 
had ordered the gag ruk. 

For those wondering why so 
much rus~ was madc ovcr a "B+," 
for a grad studclll th\.: grade can 
mean the ditTerenl:e hetween gell ing 
a great job or not gelling any job. 

"It ·s the be lief of many that any-
thing less than an . A' in grad school 
is equivalent to a fai l," said one his-
tory grad student. 

That the cOnlroversy arose over 
the History 700 seminar also comes 
as no surpri se to several History 
grad students, 'ince the seminar is 
widely regarded as a difficult class 
with tough. even caustic teachers, 
they said. 

"Seven hundred is almost like a 
boot camp for history students," the 
student said. 

As to why the department chose 
to crase, rather than uphold Jacob's 
grade, numerous theories exist. In 
the Chronicle arti cle. several 
anonymous History professors 
offered explanations ranging from 
Jacob's recent lack of seniority in 
the department to resentment over 

the belief that Jacob was hired to 
keep her partner, prominent 
History Professor Lynn Hunt. from 
leaving Penn. 

umerous department officiab 
denied the claim lhat Jat:ob was 
hired so lely to keep Hunt on stafr. 

"The implication appearing in 
the artic le lin the Cimmiclej thai 
Peg Jacob was hi red solely to keep 
Lynn Hunt at Penn is not accurate." 
SAS Dean Samuel Preston said, 
addi ng that Jacob was recruited 
"bet:ause she is a distinguished 
scholar and teacher." 

As of now, it appears that both 
Jacob and Hunt will probably leave 
Penn to teach at the Uni versity of 
California in Los Angeles in the 
near future. 

Although UCLA olTicially 
denies making an offer to the two 
professors, last spring Jacob e-
mailed her colleagues saying that 
she planned to teach at UCLA this 
coming January, ci ting Penn 's 
History Department 's handling of 
the di scrimination charges as the 
reason, accordi ng to the Chronicle. 

Hunt is similarly expected tn 
Icave Penn for UCLA, allhough no 
offi cial announcements have been 
made and she said her possible 
departure "has nOlhing to do with" 
Jacob's case.

Althuugh domestic partner ben-

Penn State employees like Kiersten 
Elliott, a residence life coordinator, 
have utililed a long-standing mar-

the ~ame benefits granted to 
employees' spouses. 

In Pennsy lvania, if partners in a

that we're starting a new School of

According to Penn State's bene-
fit s task force, corporations oller-

include technology moguls Apple

Corporation, as well as AT&T and 
Nike [ne., both of which - coinci-

Penn State has been exploring

partner benefi ts for many years. 
Willits said. 

"Given that we now understund

The UCSD Guardian La Jollan Beaches Photo Essay 

he town of La Jolla. UCSD's high-rent neighbor by the 
sea, is an internationally famous tourist destination. One 
night a few years ago at a hostel in England, I found 
myself swappi ng stories with a dozen travelers from 
places that spanned the globe. When I mentioned that I 
went to school in La Joll a, an impeccably dres ed young 
man with an aristocratic air responded that he had been 
there, and thought it was one of the best places he had 
ever been. For the next several minutes he described all 
the things he loved about La Jolla: the restaurants, the 

shops, the galleries and so on. Every time he mentioned a spe-
cific gallery or restaurant, he would ask my impressions of it. 
I'd have to respond that L being a (re latively) poor student, 
had never even heard of the place he clearly adored. After this 
went on for a while, it became apparent that our experi ences 
of La Jolla had been so different Ihal we might as well have 
been in two different worlds. 

It is easy to get the impression that La Jolla is a playground 
for rich senior citizens and wannabe yuppies, with nothing for 
someone without a wallet fu ll of gold cards. The streets of this 
odd little town are lined with impeccable little shoppes and 
upper-crust restaurants that can make your tui ti on check to the 
UC Regents look like pocket change. Everything costs more 
in La Jolla, even groceries at Vons. 

This is not to say that there is no reason to go to La Jolla -
just don't spend any money while you're there. La Jolla is a 
great place for beach combing. Perched on a kink in the nor-
mally arrow-straight California coastline, the shore at La 10lla 
is broken into a rugged series of jagged outcrops and small 
tide-washed beaches . Although places like La 10lla Shores 
and the Cove are orten crowded with lourists and locals alike, 
there is enough to see and do along the shore that you can for-
give all the other people being there 100. 

The number 34 bus (free with an st ick-
er from Transportation Alternatives) 
travels between campus and La Jolla 
every half hour. Take your lunch with 
you, and you can spend the day checking 
out the coast without maxing out your 
credit card.

The challenges of romantic 
relationships can be 

exacerbated by the added 
burden of physical distance 

By Jessica Scheppmann 
Features Editor 

Roosevelt Senior Heather Vickery has just 
embarked 011 the emotional journey that is a long 
distance relationship_ Her boyfriend, Yuan-Juhn 
Chiao, known as Chyn, is a junior at U.c. Berkley. 
She spoke to the Guardian regarding the feelings 
she is going through in a lOllg distallce, interracic:l 
relmion.ship_ During tile jirst jive years after high 
school, wilen a student's life is so transitional, 
many people jind themselves in similar situations. 
Guardl .... : Can you ten me a little about 
him? 

Vickery: It 's kind of interesting, because he's 
from Taiwan. So it's also an interracial relation-
ship. It's weird because our relationship staned in 
high school. We [dated], but we had never said, 
"yeah, we want to go out. We want a relationship," 
So there were some issues that were undefined 
there. There was probably about nine months in 
my sophomore year where we didn 't talk that 
much, just because we were sort of going off in our 
own separate directions, Then we staned talking 
again, and our relationship has sort of blossomed 
from there, I think that we are much better r riends 
now, certainly, then we were in high chool. And 
our feelings for each other are much closer, 

Over the summer we talked a fair amount. Just on 
the weekends when he was home, and that kind of 
thing. And then we went out, but it was always in a 
group of friends. It was one of those weird things 
where there was chemistry, and [we could tell] that 
our feelings hadn't quite left yet. During the end of 
Augu t, we started talking about it one night and we 
just were like, "where arc we right nowT' We real-
ized that we had come to a point in our relation hip 
where we needed to either go forward, or kind of 
hold off and just really remain friends. and we decid-
ed that we would rather take the risk and go forward 
with it, knowing that we were going to be apart_ But

Both the parent and child.go 
through a period of adjustment 
when students embark on their 
freshman year 
By John Maynard 
Senior Staff Writer. 

Freshman year of college begins one of life's 
first big transitions. For the first ti me, students 
have to share a room with a stranger, piek a long-
distance carrier and casually negotiate the toilet 
while seven strangers linger in the hallway. Need-
It:ss to say, there are many things to get uptight 
about. 

To make things worse (or better), freshman 
year often marks the first separation of students 
from their parents. 

Move-in day on campus is a most interesting 
social experiment. During this anxiety-filled day, 
tudents arc anxious to claim their side of the 

room, scope out the hotties and get rid of their 
parents. The parents on the other hand, intent on 
embarrassing their child, lurk as long as possible, 
establishing their reign as parents. 

With such a dichotomy, tempers inevitably 
flare. By the end of move-in day, first-year tu-
dents are siek of their parents, They just want their 
parents to hook them up with some Red Vines, 
some Top Ramen, and microwave popcorn, float 
them a 20, and then get out. They want to start 
their "new" life. 

"When 1 first moved into the dorms, 1 was 
ready for my parents to leave," third-year Muir 
College Housing Advisor Erin Knipe said. "I said 
'bye' and len my parents behind in my room 
while I went to get luneh with my new room-
mate." 

While first-year students begin their new li fe, 
their parents do not abandon their notions of par-
enting, Knipe says that although the parents are 
away, they are certainly not out of the picture_ 

"None of my kids' parent have called, but their 
have been other HA [Housing Advi or J who 
have been contacted by kids' parents wondering if 
their child is doing OK," Knipe-said.

Associated Stltdent President 

FACES OF UCSD 
Surprising insights from the man who leads our student body 

By Marc Comer and 
Julia Kulla-Mader 
Senior Staff Writers 
Motto: "Everything you do means 
nothing if it doesn ' t benefit other 
people." 
Personal: From Aguura Hill~. 
Calif. His family wnsist~ of hi s 
Mom, step-dad, dad, step-mom and 
~ister. who is married. three years 
older and lives in San Jose. Mon-
day (today) is her binhday. 
Claim to Fame: '" bel:ame very 
involved freshman year at Marshall 
I:ollege. And A.S. was something' 
was interested in, not really pank-
ipating in. But sinl:e I've been here 
I've always followed what A.S. is 
doing. I had contemplated, my last 
year, possibly running for thi s posi -
tion, which would have ~ecn 
un usual and unique bel:ause , 
haven 't been in A.S. before. And I 
wouldn ' t run on a slate. I knew 
thaI. So it would have been very 
unique. 

I was actually approached last 
year by an A.S. senator who saw 
something in me that he thought 
wou ld make a good candidate. I'm 
not really sure why I was the per-
on he wanted to support. He ta lked 

to me once. and I got really excited 
for about 24110urs. Then I said 'No, 
I've got enough going on.' 

At that time I was managing 
A.S. Lecture Notes. , was chair of 
the lJniversity Centers Advisory 
Board and I was involved in run-
ning cross I:ou ntry. I thought . 'I've 
got everything I want. why try and 

Nothing Is as 
rewarding as getting 
8-mail from a stu-
dent who has never 
met me but Is con-
cerned about some-
thing, and In the 
same day to be able 
to get them an 
answer from the 
vice-chancellor or 
somebody who they 
would never have 
access to. 

go for more'!' So that 's what I sa id 
after the fi rst ti me he approached 
me. Then he approached me again 
about a week later and had a little 
bit more information for me. Same 
thing, for about 24 hour I was real-
ly excited. Then I thought ·No. 
stick with what you've got.' 

By the third time he approached 
me. I had thought about it so mll!.:h 
that if I didn't do it I'd always won-
der 'What if'! ' I decided to go for it. 
When I set my sights on something 
I really put a lot of energy into it. 
So .-I really ran a lOp campai gn, and 
here I am. 
Goals: My goa ls as A.S. president 
I see in two ways - one. what am 
I going to do for students who arc 
here now? How am I goi ng to sup-

pon studcnt organizations that are 
here'! How am r going to suppon 
student life by encouraging new 
and large-scale programming? I see 
that as one aspet.:t of what my goals 
are. Then, what t.:an I do in this 
position that will change the Asso-
t.:iated Students. that will benefit 
students for future years to come? 

I have some very concre te goals 
in that area. I plan to put a new 
constitution on the ballot in thc 
spring for the IAssociated Stu-
dentsl . People who were here last 
ycar may be aware of some of my 
objections to thc way elections are 
run . I think the way the structu re of 
lAssodated StudentsJ is set up pro-
motes a lot of the inlighting, and 
there's a la(;k of progress within the 
organization. I thi nk that can be 
very easily solved by a new frame-
work, under which the organization 
runs. That's one or my vcry con-
crete goals. 

I plan to go to law school next 
year and get a joint J.D. and 
M.B.A., probably tinker around in 
politics and see where I go from 
there. 

I definitely want to be a candi-
date, a lot of people don't want 
that. r want to stan with local poli -
ti l:s. maybe eventually be in the 
House. II 's hard to say because I 
really like to think that I have a 
very positive allitude, and I t.:an 
only tell people how it is. 1 (;an ' t 
de(;cive peuple in any way. Some 
people can justify Idc(;eiving oth-
ers/. and' just l:an't. I don't knuw

Hobble.: "I love running. I ran

ran for four years in high sl:hool. 

ow I basically run on my own. I 
like photography. I really enjoy 
fri ends and talking to people. I love 
di scussing different topics with 
people. That's really one of the best 
things I've found in college. Espe-
cially freshman year, you're living

a couple of hours every night talk-

Features cailor 

Every year, UCSD is tr~ated 10 
the intimate de! :\ils of editors' indi-
vidual rant ~. The ol'inion sel:tion, 
which in the past has been notori-
ous for some of the steamier 
Guardian gossip, h<\s been 
revamped to allow for a less per-
sonal approach . Have no fear, 
though, bccau~e The Editor's Soap-
box is still a valuable medium for 
edi tors to vent their pet peeves. 

A variety of topics, ranging from 
the im;reasingly obnoxious parking 
cops to the short hours at the UCSD 
bureaucratic offices, are all poten-
tial subjects for this column. 

The drinking antics of the spons 
staff around Sun God, the invasion 
of a boa conSirictor through the 
shower drain in my on-campus 
apartment last year, the road trip 
our editor in chief didn ' t have time 
to take this summer (but wi II some-
day accomplish), and the daily 
grind of married life for the manag-
ing editor will all be availab le for 
your weckly entertainment. 

Additionally, there are the more 
seriou~ topics. Columns discussing 
life, love and the pursuit of happi -
ness - and occasionally finding 
unhappiness - are also available. 
In short. this is the place to look 
when you want to get to know a 
member of the staff. As the edi tor 
of this section, I thought it filling 
for me to start . 

In no way. sh~lpe or limn do I 
intend this column to be a male-hash-
ing fonlln . As a fairly mature and 
educated person, I believe strongly in

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Interactions between men and women prove incompatability 

equality between the sexes. 
Hav ing said that, I must say th at 

I absolutely and completely do not 
understand men. I will admit , 
though, that I don ' t entirely under-
stand women either. 

I n the pas! 20 or 30 years, a 
drastic social upheaval significant-
ly altered the roles of men and 
women. One of the higgest prob-
lems created by these changes is a 
lack of understanding in terms of 
the roles men and women play in 
each other's lives. Outdated social 
distinctions and expectations create 
an aura of mystery that acts as a 
wall bet ween the sexes. 

I am sure that there has been a 
significant amount of adjustment 10 
the thinking pallerns of members of 
the older generations. There is a lit-
tle bit more of a problem, however. 
for the younger generations. who 
have been raised, for the most part, 
to ex pect equal treatment for every-
one, regardless of gender. 

The up-and-coming products of 
the younger generations have had 
to deal with a culture where the 
roles of men and women are not 
clearly delined. 

For the most part , the only thing 
thai has been accomplished recent-
ly is a confUSing mix of me,sages 
that men and women mu,t some-
how manage to li ve up to . 

Men have to deal with societal 
expectations that dictate that they 
behave in a manly way, and not give 
into their ~en si ti ve sides. Many who 
arc unable tn uphold thc~e ~landards 

Observing those in 
love can be an 
inspiring thing, until 
you hear the dreaded 
questions: What's 
her problem?' Why 
hasn't he called? Did 
she Just loose 
interest? How do you 
Just loose Inferest? 
Has he called yet? 
No? Figures. He's 
such a guy. What 
can you expect from 
a woman? 
are ridiculed and persecutcd to the 
ex tent that their gender is doubted. 
This leads to confusing messages 
when they arc also expected to be 
sensitive and gentle toward the 
women in their lives. 

Women also receive conflicting 
messages. Despite the fact that 
most government regulations 
require that women be given the 
same opportunities a~ men. there 
still rcmains a socia lly ingrained 
gender gap. Remember Barbie'! 
Thi~ chick'~ only speaking words 
were to say that "Math is hard." 
Paired with ideas like girls are 
"sugar and spi ce," these confusing 
messages are sent to women who 
have to balance thei r independence 

with their femininity. 
I think thi , ambiguity has created 

a ~igniticant amount of romantic ten-
sion. Based on their personal experi-

ence~, many women believe that 
"guys are jerks." Men seem com-
pletely perple)(ed at this sentiment, 
yet thei r altitudes toward women 

~eem to mirror this lack of respect. 
Women have asserted their 

independence soc ially and se)(ual-
Iy, yet we are still sensitive crea-
tures. Sometimes, I admit, it 's hard 
to find this same sensitivity in men. 
Certain members of our editorial 
staff claim that women can be cate-
gorized as evil and manipUlative. 

The fact is that while this cate-
gorization may be true for some 
people, it isn' t universal. The mis-
understandings that create these 
feelings are usually consequences 
of mixed emot ions, half-truths and 
an overall lack of communication. 

Observing tho 'e in love can be 
an inspiring thing, until you hear the 
dreaded questions: What's her prob-
lem? Why hasn' t he called? Did she 
just loose interest? How do you just 
loose illleresl? Has he called yet? 
No. Figures. He's su~h a guy. What 
~an you expe~t from a wO/llan'? 

The ~onlli cting e)(pec.: tations of 
society create diflicult si tuations. 
The unclear boundaries that every-
one must respect creates tense si tu-
ations in male/female relationships 
when one partner fails to li ve up to 
their supposed requircll1ent~ . 

Until men anJ wOlm;n can ' fe~s 
up and admit that they are hiologi -

cally equal, and then move on from 
there, there is lillie hope for 
improvement. Both sexes need to 
see that it isn't just sex (excuse me, 
gender) that impairs their relation-
ships. Instead, society'S control over 
sewal and mental development has 
created these mi)(ed-up roles. 

For the most part, a mutual con-
feren~e of understanding and gen-
eral acknowledgment are the ollly 
tools that we have to end the bailie 
between the sexes. 

When men can stop basing thei r 
manhood on their penis size and 
stan drawing pleasure from thei r 
mature approach to healthy relation-
sh ips, then we' ll have a good start. 

When women ~an stop agonizing 
over external beauty and superticial 
qualific.:ations. and develop respect 
for themselves and others as valu-
able people, then we'll have a start. 

Finally, when men and women 
can begin speaking the same lan-
guage and stop using COSII10 maga-
zine as an interpreter, then we ' ll 
have a good start . The only way to 
improve the level of respect men 
and women have for each other is 
(0 start with some honesty.

Continued from ...... 24 
th .... IIbout JOW Job?: I think 
the mosl difficult thing aboul my 
job is not being able to serve ~II the 
demand Ihal are put on me as ade-
qualely as I would like. I constant-
ly have people up here, a'round my 
office, who want 10 lalk to me or 
need something from me. I think I 
always address their issues. but I 
can' t always address Ihem as 
quickly as I would like. I don't 
have Ihe luxury of any free time. 
So, I Ihink that 's my largest chal-
lenge righl now. 

I Ihink the grealer challenge is 
trying to jugg le my job as A.S. 
presidenl with schoolwork. Right 
now, I can neglect the schoolwork a 
lillie, but I know that wi II become a 
problem eventually. 
Wh.t I. the MOst r.w.rdlng 
.sped of ,our job?: I think the 
most rewarding thing is being able 
to serve a~ many people as I do. 
I've been involved in so many 
things on campus in dilferentlead-
ership positions, but nothing i~ as 
rewarding as gelling e-mail from a 
student who has never met me but 
is concerned about something. and 
in the same day to be able to get 
them an answer Irom the vice-
chancellor or somehody who they 

would never have access 10 as a 
regular student, and to make them 
feel like they are being listened to. 

That 's where I came from, the 
outside to r Associated Students]. I 
think everybody in a university Ihis 
large doesn ' t feel like they arc 
being li stened to. When I can pro-
vide that for students. that '~ the 
most rewarding thing.

In 15 J ..... ?: In 15 years, I' ll be 
in L.A., and I'll be a sport fenter-
lainment lawyer just starting up my 
campaign for governor. I'll be mar-
ried, and I will have one child with 
a second on its way. 
Who .... been the biU .. t 
Influenc. In Jour 11f.?: I think 
my friends have been the biggest 
influence in my life. My friends arc 
so unique, and although a lot of 
people look at me and my position 
as A.S. pre~i dent and think, "Wow, 
how can he do that."!" to me, what I 
have to do here is so simple com-
pared to some of the things my 
friends are doing. I mean. I'm a 
political science major. And 
although it 's not easy, some or my 
friend s are animal physiology 
majors and the things that they can 
do and the way they think, that I 
can't. is just amazing 10 me -

P.t P .. v •• : I hate when people 
introduce me as "Joe, our A.S. 
president ," be~ause people always 
have an opinion of me one way or 
another. and I like people to take 
the time to get to know me. 
Most valu.ble .... t: I don'l 
care if I'm recogni zed. I' ve grown 
up not really being recognized for 
the efforts that 1 put in . And I think 
my asset is that I' ve learned to 
appreciate myself and the things 
that I do, and give myself that grat-
i tication. Because of that ) never 
feel like I'm miss ing something. It 
allows me to continue to strive for 
more, because I've learned to give 
myself the gratification Ihal a lot of 
olher people seek outside of them-
selves. 
If you could ch...g. on. thing 
IIbout UCSD what would It 
be?: I think I'd create a program 
where every student had the oppor-
tunity to be a faculty member for a 
day, a staff member for a day. Or 
the staff member had the opportu-
nity to be a studenl or facult y mem-
ber for the day. Or every fa <.: ulty 
member had the option to be a staff

What .... UCSD t.u~ you?: 
UCSD has taught me how to take 
advantage of the opportunities that 
are presented 10 you. Meaning, 
how to be a productive member of 
the cummunity while pursing my 
personal goals which include edu-
cation and getting my degree. 
Who would you Ilk. to hay. 
dinner with?: Probably the 
founding fathers of our country. 
Just because to be it 's so intriguing 
how our country was created. And I 
would love to see what they think 
of where we are today, how far 
away we are from where they 
intended us to be. 
How has UCSD ch.nged with-
out affirm.tlve .ctlon?: Not 
only has it failed to fulfill its mis-
sion of educating the diverse popu-
lation of whom its supposed to 
serve, it has also lessened the edu-
cational va lue of those who have 
made it. 
I. the model school good or 
b.d for UCSD?: Good. The 
model school is good for UCSD 
because one, UCSD is part of a 
community, and we're conslantly 
doi ng thi ngs to be part of that <.:Om-
munity and to be good neighbors. 
This is someth ing that is essential 
to continue that trend . And, two, I 
think that it 's good for UCSD 
bccau~e there will be a 101 of edu-
cational upportuniti es for students 
at thi, school wi th the Model 
School being on campu~ .

Wh.t I. you opinion of 
aIM •• ?: I think slates to a degree 
are appropriate, because you have a 
more effective student government 
if you have people who are Iike-
minded. However, I think they 
need to be severely limited in their 
size, and J think thaI the rules 
always have to be set up to always 
protecl individual candidates who 
may want to run as such. 
What I. som.thlng your ...... 
ents would be surprlud to 
know .a.out you?: They 'd be 
surprised to know that I have a hard 
lime keeping all my clothes on 
when I drink too much. 
What .civIc. would you glv. 
to fr ....... en?: Get involved and 
make sure you have a 101 more to 
talk aboul than just your dasses. 
If you w.r. President Clinton 
would 'OU r.slgn or w.1t for 
Impeachment?: I would resign 
for the good of Ihe country and for 
t he respect of our system of gov-
ernment.

DISTANCE: 
Partners must take 
change into account 
Continued from page 23 
I think that fostering the friendship 
part of the relationship gave us a 
step up in being apart, and in having 
a more romantic relationship. 
Does it help that you are 
graduating soon and can 
look forward to baing 
together? 

I don't know. I think that we're 
kind of taking it one vacation break 
at a time. We're not sure exactly 
where were going to be. He'd love 
to be in law sl.:hool right after he 
graduates. continuing his edul.:a-
tion. But I'm not exactly sure 
where I'm going to be. Su, we' re 
kind of taking it as we come. 

It 's one of those issues that I 
don ' t think we've talked about. 
We haven ' t disl.:ussed marriage, Dr 
li ving together, or anything that 
advam:ed. We' re trying to see how 
the relati onship plays itself out. 
What do you do to keep In 
touch with each other? 

E-mai l is a big thing for LIS 
right now. We also do some leller 
writing, When I was still in Palo 
Alto and he was in Berkeley, we 
started writing lellers even though 
we li ved so close, ThUl was fun 
because that was something tangi -
ble, ~orne thing that I (;Qu id hold on 
to. 

00 you have any advice 
for anyone who is thinking 
about getting Involved In a 
long distance relationship, 
or who is worried about their 
own? 

One of our issues is. "how arc 

we going to change when we are 
apart. and how is it that we are 
going to re·discover each other 
when we're back together?" I think 
that lit helps to 1 at least be aware of 
that issue and the possibility that 
this is not going to be the same pcr· 
son. [The possibility] that you may 
very well have to fall in love wi th 
them all over again exists. but real-
izing that that possibility is there. 
and making it a part of your rela· 
tionship, is pretty much what we've 
done. We want to change more as 
people, we want to be ditlerent peo· 
pie when we see each other again so 
that we can fall in love again. 

His little word for it is rein-
venting yourself, so that you are a 
new person. We have I.:ertainly 
been throu gh ups and downs 
together, and we 've been there for 
each other, so I think that there is 
an element of trust that we know 
Ithe other person] will be there. 
even if something were to happen, 
say that we were to meet some-
body di rrerent. Our big thing is 
that we wa nt to maintain the 
rriend 'hip, bccau 'e it is such a 
good friendship . But we very 
mUl.:h cnjoy having a roman!!c 
relationship at the same time. 
Did your previously existing 
friendshIp change anything? 

I think that Ithc friendship] has 
been a honus. It has detinitely 
hclped us that we have becn 

fri end~ for ~o long, and and have 
hccn sUl.:h close friends. It 's been 
odd in the sense that our relation-
ship hasn 't gone through the nor· 
mal course of dating and gelli ng to 
know each other. We kind of did 
that tirst ca rli er on and then added 
the romanti c part of the relation-
ship. I think that it has made LIS

stronger, and made us more open 
to [the possibility of a long dis· 
tance relationship]. When we did 
start talking about it say ing that we 
did want a relationship, [our 
friendship] made it easier in some 
ways to talk about it, because we'd 
already gotten to a certain level of 
understanding and of being open 
with each other. We were able to 
rea lly bring out more of our feci· 
ings. I think Ithe romantic aspect] 
has opened up our relationship 
more then it already was. 
Did you have any anxlatles 
about entering Into a long 
distance ralatlonshlp? 

I think [ had the nomlal separa· 
tion anxieties with us being apart, 
but I think I was just kind of more 
curious. What is this going to be 
like" Because we have been sUl.:h 
good friends. How is this going to 
change? Is this going to be dillerenl 
from what we had before', I think 
that some of these questions have 
been answered. Yes it is dl flerent. I 
think that our relationship is much 
deeper now. It 's much more fullill· 
ing. Whereas before we rcpre:..~ed 
some of our romantic feelings 
towards each other. 1101'.' we arc 
mllch more open with that. and we 
brin\! tllO~e to the surrace. and we 
don ' t holtt back. So there was anxi· 
ely. It was just the unknown. 

I (hink that therc were sOl11e 
initial anxieties in the respeci or 
our familic~ and the interracial 

is~ue. My fami Iy is I'ery open, 
even though pcople from thc mid· 
west have the stcreotype ur being 
closed minded. which I can ~ee 
how that 's true, hecause I lived 
there fur 16 years. But my family 
is a very open famil y. not typica l 
in that sense. I think that hi s rami -

Iy was more concerned with the 
i sue then my was. But they had 
known me for a number of years. 
and that certainly helped, 

His position on it was very 
strong, that this was something that 
he needs in his life. to better him· 
se lf. and that it is part of his growth 
experiem:e. And mine as well. 

I think for us it's different , 
because we 're used to the dis -
tance, even if it hasn' t been 
romantic. Now it's different. but 
you slill want someone there, to be 
in somcone's arms. I tell him that I 
want to share the life that I have 
here with him, hecause he doesn't 
know that much about it. I know 
what his life lis] like in Berkeley, 
but he doesn' t know anything 
about my life down here, One of 
the (hings I might do is take s me 
pic( ures around lampus, to show 
him what it looks like down here, 

We're seeing where it takes us. 
I think that we' re trying to have 
fun with it. It's ni ce to know that 
we ' re only a phone 1.::\ 11 apan. We 
do SOllie of the basic sluff, we e-
mati , but for more seriou~ issues I 
like to talk to someone. to hear hi s 
voice, Wh ' n you're apart. cven if 
you arc talking, you only hear ·the 
voice. but the question of how to 
interpret the words is a problem. 
We had a conversation la~ t night 
where I was thinking of the worst 
case scenario, but (hat was not

PARENTS: 
Independence 
changes roles 
Continued from ..... 23 

Kn ipe sa id that the parents have 
ca lled because their children 
haven't touched base, and not 
because they are paranoid, 

"The parents aren't totally con-
cerned with whether or not their 
kid is partying too much or not 
eating at all , they just want to 
know if they are settling in," 
Knipe said. 

Though the parent"student rcla· 
ti onship may be a little shaky for 
the tirst few months of freshmen 
year, many older students believe 
th at being away from home 
improved their relation hip with 
their parent . 

"B y the end of my senior year 
in hi gh school , I fought a lot with 
my parents," Muir junior Erin 
Kuehnel said . "Now that [ have 
been away at school. my parents 
and I get along a lot beller. I'm 
happy to go home and hang out 
with them." 

Muir junior Dara Burl.:h agrees. 
"When I I.:all home, its because I 
actually want to talk to my 1110 111 ." 

Though the student -parent reill ' 
tionship often gets off to a rocky 
start, both the parents and the stu-
dents learn to adapt to life's latest 
transition . Eventuall y, parenb 
learn that their "baby" has grown 
up and can responsibly make cru· 
cial decisions on hi s own. Mure 
importantly, students rea li!.e that 
their parents arc actually "cool," 
and that they weren't out to embar-
rass them on move- in day - they 
just cared .

"Kristi ~howed a lot out there." 
Van Arsdale ~aid . "De~pite her res-
pi ratory problems. she had lots of 
fire left late in the race . She had the 
intensity and determination to tin-
i h. " 

Not far hehind O'Grady was the 
tandem of Amy Hawkins and Amy 
Olin, who linished in 61 th and 67th 
place, re~pcctively. 

"Amy 10lini ran the hc~t race 
wc've ever seen from her," Van 
Arsdale ~aid . "She di splayed a 
year\ growth out there. She's more 
aware of what attitude i ~ needed to 
win." 

Van Ar~dale wa~ pleased with 
the perfonnance of his entire team 
and that he believe~ thi s tea m ha a 
dlunce to be very cOl11pctiti ve. 

"Everyone on tile team did 
every thing they were a,ked to do," 
he said. 'This week we ran our 10th 
through 20th best runners against 
the other team " best runners. So we 
know we have potential. Making it 
to the national championship ' is a 
detinitely realistic goal." 

Wi th their ,trongest runners 
rested, the Tritons shou ld have a 
good showing next week when 
they will travel north to w mpete in 
the Stanford Invitat ional. 

This is one of the biggest meets 
of the season for Van Arsdale\ 
troops. but they seem primed and 
ready to make a splash in Palo Alto. 
despite the very strong competi-
tion .

DROUGHT: De pite excellent support by Triton fans, UCSD falls to Irvine in a poor shooting display 
By Johr, Ma~nard 
Sports Editor 

Sometime~ a rowdy, well -fed 
crowd isn't enough to inspire vic-
tory. Sometimes, it 's not even 
enough to fuel a strong stan.

Such wa . the I:a~e when UCSD 
hosted UC Irvine last Friday at 
Canyonview Pool. Despite the 
rather large and verbose crowd 
backing the UCSD men 's water 
polo team, the Tritons were unable 
to overtake the Anteaters, falling 
to 4-5 on the season. 

In the 12-4 loss, UCSD gave 
up seven points in the opening 
minutes.

While thi strange pairing may 
create epic struggles for editoria l

John and I both have the same goal 
in mind : hearty sport s coverage

"We didn 't come out ready to 
play in the first quarter." said 
senior hole 'et Doug Cole said. 

Usa Huff/ Guardian 
Stone Cold: Ross Mecham scores one of his two goals in Friday's game against UC Irvine. Goals 
were hard to come by, as the Tritons only converted four of 33 shots against a tough UCI defense . 

For those of you that remember 
the old editor, he's st ill around. He 
wanders around the building 
drinking something out of a ther-
mos, mumbling various sports sta-
t i stics and twi teh i ng. It 's a sad 
story but John and I can handle the 
pressure. 

We're running the show now so 
just wateh as we fi II these glorious 
pages with nuggets of sport s infor-
mation and our own stale wit. 

Down by seven at the end of the 
fi rst quarter. the Tritons were 
forced to play catch-up for the rest 
of the game. UCSD swred two 
goals in the second quarter, but also 
gave up another goal, tmiling 8-2 
at the half. . 

"We had a lot of opportunities, 
but we didn 't cash in on them," 
Cole said. "We had lots of six on 
five opponunities. but we didn ' t 
convert on them."

"If we had made 30 percent of

we only made 10 per.:ent of our

Cole said that he was a part of

from the pool, the Tritons essen-

Whether or not UCSD wi ll be 

placed in the same bracket as UCI 
in the Nor Cal tournament remains 
uncertain . However, the Tritons 
have more urgent things to worry 
about as they travels to Santa Cruz 
thi s weekend for the annual UC 

anta Cruz Slug Fest. 
Though there will probably be 

less Triton fa ns on hand for this

TAMING: Thirteen Tritons contribute to UCSD's 15-], l5-2, 15-1 victory 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

Though Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland 's women 's volleyball 
squad is not perfect, it is safe to say 

that hi s squad isn ' t too far away. 
Before Saturday night 's game 
again ·t visi ting Occidental 
Co llege, there were few negati ve 
things anyone could ay about 
UCSD women's volleyball. After 
the game. there were even fewer. 

In 12 matches, the 10-2 Tritons 
have won 33 games and lost only 
six. Moreover, their 10 victori<!s 
have all been sweep~. 

In Saturday 'S ncar-perfect 
match, UCS D effi ciently trampled 
the Occidental squad in a lillie over 
an hour, winning in straight games, 
15- 1, 15-2, 15- 1. 

In Wednesday's di sappointing 
loss lO Division II Pomona Co llege. 
the Tritons fell in four games 17-
IS, 12- 15, 15- 12. 15- 12. The 
women regrouped and came out 
with authorit y in Saturday ni ght's 
match, dropping only four points. 

Though Saturday night's game 
was no Divi sion II match. 
McFarland was still a bit worried. 

"We knew that we were going to 
be facing a much less experienced 
Occidental squad," McFarl and said . 
HI was worried that we wercn ' t 
go ing to keep up the intensity." 

After the match. McFarland sa id 
he was happy that his entire bench 
"still played hard ." 

"The Occidental game gave u~ 
the opportunity to play most of our 
bench," McFarl and said. "And the 
bench played just as well as th e 
starters." 

Junior outside hiller Ali son 
Bender, who led the Triton allack 
wi th fi ve kill s. also noted the col-
laboration of the entire stjuad. 

"Sometimes when you play a 
team that is not as strong as yo u. 
you end up dropping down lO thei r 
level," Bender said. "We didn ' t do 
that against Occidental. We didn ' t

Dave Lubitz/ Guardian 
Fresh Kllla' : Freshman middle blocker Kathleen Hentz powers 
another kill in Saturday night's domination over Occidental. 
let up and kept our intensi ty." 

Om: factor behind the team's 
sustained intensity was the enthusi-
astic Triton crowd. 

" It 's been great having such a 
great crowd out there supporting 
us," McFarland sa id . 'They ' ve 
rea lly helped us out at the games. J 
wish we could have had ~uc h a 
rowdy crowd hacking us in the 
Pomona gamc.'· 

Saturday night 's rowdy RIMAC 
crowd rooted for not only Bender's 
tcam-Ieadi ng fi ve kills, but al 0 the 
play of three other Tritons -
Kathleen Hentz. Shannon Noonan 
and Katheri ne Brynjeswd - who 
cach contributed four kill s. 

The crowd also bal:ked the 
eight other Tritons who took the 
court , ~even of whom had kill>. 

According to McFarland. the 
Triton,' d<! pth will prove to be intc-

gral to their game as they approach 
the postseason. 

"It 's good to have some depth," 
McFarland said. "When you get 
towards the end of the season,

Mad Sklllz: Cameron Adams shows off his fancy footwork to the

Greetings from the 
Greedman himself. ObViously 
due to some horrible mix-up by 
the powers-that-be this summer, 
it has been decided that yours 
truly, ye olde Greedbucket , has 
been appointed executive brew 
master and editor. 

As this is my first column of 
the year, I promise to bring you 
the best possible Guardiall 
Sports product I can (and try not 
to get too drunk in the process). 
It 's going to be difficult. though. 

Last year is just a fuzzy 
memory to me now after a very 
eventful summer, but I think I' ll 
get the hang of thi s writing stuff 
eventually. What I guess the 
head honchos here d n' t rea ll y 
rea li ze is that all I tend to write 
about is myse lf. Me. Me. Me. 

Well , sometimes I write 
about beer and sports. but that 's 
about it. It will take some time, 
but I don 't think my greediness 
will be a big problem. Still , if 
you read that Jake Gordon had 
three goal ' and an assist or 15 
kill ' and a block, cut me a little 
slack, OK? After all, I know I'm 
greedy and want lots 01 glory 
but admitting you have a prob-
lem i the first step to a cure. 

Apparently to atone for their 
monumental error and in an 
attempt to counterbalance my 
greediness, the Guardiall man-
agement have appointed John 
Maynard as my co-editor. I 
think they are fore 'eeing a kind

Although no one was say ing it , 
it was on everyone 's mind. 

" 0, I wasn ' t thinking about 
it," SD Head oach Derek 
Armstrong said when asked about 
the revenge factor in last Friday 
night 's match between the SO 
men's soccer team and the 
Claremont College Stags. "But I 
think it was on some of the Iplay-
ers ' ] minds." 

This game was more than just 
a regular season game. 

This game was a journalist's 
dream, overllowing with different 
storylines. But the biggest one of 
all was that this game was the li rst 
time the Tritons had faced the 

tags since last season's playoff 
heartbreaker. 

That match wi II go down as 
ne of the worst defeats in recent 

Triton soccer history. laremont 
had 10 men after a red card, but it 
still managed to score a nuke goal 
and somehow hold off sev-
eral Triton allacks and 
win, 1-0. 

But last Friday 
night it was time for 
revenge. 

The game was a bat-
tle between two of the West 
Coast 's top Division III soccer 
programs. It wa ' a fight for 
UCSO's playoff life, as the 
Tritons had lost their last three 
matches. 

Let 's face it - it was an enor-
mous bailie that the Tritons won, 
2- 1. 

"The game was an absolutely 
huge win for us," Armstrong said. 
"We keep the season alive now. 
We are starting with a clean sheet 
again." 

This victory is the fresh start 
Armstrong 's boys needed. They 
had lost three straight games, the 

most reLent a 3- 1 loss at 
Point Lorna azarene 

University. 
A fourth consecu-

tive loss could have 
meant the death of 

Triton postseason hopes, 
Goals from junior Mike 

Sanders and freshman Daniel 
Appel made the difference, as the 
Tritons survived a sometimes 
sloppy affair in front of an esti-
mated 200 faithful Triton fans. 

It wasp 't pretty, but the Tritons 
worked ex tremely hard. 
Armstrong had to shuftle hi s line-
up with two of his top scoring 
threats sidelined due to injuries, 
Brady Bernard and Sean Salinas 
cou ld not play, and both are likely 
to miss more matches. Armstrong 

UCSD Rebounds With Win 
RESILIENT: Tritons bounce back from fir t los to blowout Cal Baptist 4-1 
By Jacob Gordon 
Sports Editor 

The first game right after a hard -
loss is a good indicator of the a 
team's character. It shows 
what kind of determina-
tion and re 'i liency it 
has, and how it 

• will perform in 
clutch situations. 

For a team to 
perform well , it needs to 
come out ready to play, 
pUlling the last game behind it and 
focusing on the ta k at hand. When 
players perform well. they h w 
that they have the confidence in 
themselves to not let one game get 

them down . 
The UC D women's soccer 

team made such a statement thi s 
Friday with a 4-1 win against 

alifornia Baptist ollege in 
Riverside. 

After three straight 
wins, the Triton ' 
were coming off 
their first loss of 
the season. a 

tough 2-1 match against 
Westmont College. UCSO 

just missed tying the game several 
time ' in th second half. 

A much younger team than in 
la t year's championship ea -on, 
the Triton ' easily could have fold-

ed in their next game. In 'tead, they 
took out their frustrations on the 
hapless Baptists and upped their 
record to 4-1- 1. 

Despite a slow game because of 
strong winds, the Tritons struck 
quickly on a free kick early in the 
first half. Running a 'et play, junior 
defender Janine Harispe lofted a 
perfect ball into the goal area 
where senior Shelbi Thiele won it 
in the air and headed it home. 

UC 0 rolled from then on with 
enior Alison Hurley. freshmen 

Laura Dooly and Jessica ordova

With these new starters in , 
Arm trong also moved some of 
the original II . Robert Benowicz 
shifted from sweeper to midfield 
and Cameron Adams changed 
from defensive to central mid-
fi eld. 

The new makeshift lineup 
seemed to work well on Friday, 
especially for Adams who 
returned to the center of th-e Triton 
attack. He played a wonderful 
match, teaming well with the 
other Triton central midtielder, 
Bryan Song. Adams took on Stag 
defenders and fed the forwards 
with great passes - it looked like 
last year all over again for the 
Triton star. 

LUllon and Sanders also
