AN DIEGO - The Student 
In formation Society, a one-
week-old st uden t organizati on 
at San Diego State University, 
has accused the Associated 
Students of SDSU of vio lating 
the California Brown open 
meeting laws. The group 
alleges that the counci l broke 
the law when it discussed 
plans to reduce the size of a 
campus beer garden during a 
February retreat. Two days 
after the retreat, the A.S. held 
a hearing to discuss the mat-
tcr, but posters advertising thc 
hearing were not put up until 
30 minutes before it began. As 
a result, no students attended.

ASUCLA Pay. Back 
Half of Loan 
LOS ANGELES - The 
Associated Students of UCLA 
paid back half of the 
$800,000 it owes the universi -
ty on an emergency line of 
credit and plans to pay hack 
the rest of the money soon. 
However, ASUCLA Chief 
Financ ial Officer Rich Delia 
said the group will have to re-
borrow the second $400,000 
sometime during the summer. 
The loan is constructt;d so 
that the A.S. will pay back 
some of the loan when the 
group 's bank balance rises 
over $ 1 million . The line of 
credi t was origi nall y given to 
ASUCLA in June 1996. 
According to UCLA Assistant 
Vice Chancellor Sue Santon, 
the emergency line of credi t is 
meant onl y so that the associ -
ati on can meet payroll and 
pay its hills .

a soundstage yesterday to film a mock gymnastic meet with Olympian Kerri Strug. 

Faster, Higher, Stronger 
UCSD is the location for a primetime network TV show 

By Jenny Nicholson 
Senior Staff Writer 

For the last two months, UCSD has been 
transformed into a movie set for the filming of 
"Push," a new series that begins ai ring on ABC 

filming was an interesting leaming experience. 
"I got to have my picture taken with Kerri 

Strug," UCSD ex tra Lee Martin said. "I also 
got to learn lirst-hand what goes in to making 
a telev ision show." 

next wcck. Fifty UCSD 
students have seized the 
opportunity to act as vol -
unteer, unpaid extras for 
an episode of the show. 

"Push" Premiere 
Date: Mon., April 6 

Time: 8 p.m. 

Fi lming for "Pusb" 
began on campus on Jan. 
16, and is expected to run 
until mid-May. The tilm 
crews have been seen at 
many locations around 

Channel : KGTV·Channel 10 (ABC) 
"Push" is a series con-

cemed with the li ves of Olympic hopefuls, their 
athletic achievements, and thei r experiences at 
California Southem Univen.i ty (CSU), which is 
actually UCSD. 

"The show is based on college athletes," 
production crew member Jeff Contois said. 
"It 's a mix between young Olympic hopefuls 
and '902 10' ." 

On Wednesday, the "Push" crew turned the 
RIMAC Arena into a gymnastics arena, where 
UCSD students acted as the audience, cheering 
as the actors tumbled and !lipped through their 
routines. The episode's guest star, Olympic 
gold medalist Kerri Strug, was present and par-
ticipated in the tournament for the show. 

For UCSD students wbo served as extra~ , the 

campus, including the PriL'C Center, Warren 
College, RIMAC, the Natatorium and 
Canyonview Pool.

be lilmed at U SO. 

"UCSD is gorgeous." location technician 
Sandy Scharberg said. "We needed a large 
co llege campus. You can' t beat UCSD's 
architecture, and the facilities are wonderful." 

Scharberg had only prai~e for the RIM A 
Arena, where Wednesday 's episode was sbot. 

"This arena has heen an absolute dream," 
she said .

FRESHMEN: The number of 
racial minoritie admitted 
decline at both campuses 
By Julia Kulla-Mader 
Co-News Editor 

In the lirst year that racial preferences were 
not used in niversity of alifornia admis-
sions, U LA and U Berkeley admitted far 
fewer African-American , Latino, Mexican· 
American and Native-AITIerican students to 
thei r freshmen classes than in previous years. 

"We knew this would be a year of especial-
ly difticult and complex choices in the admis-
sion of students to the University of 
Califomia," UC President Richard Atkinson 
said in a statement released Tuesday. "The 
results reported by the Berkeley and Los 
Angeles campuses are an extreme example of 
thi s and a source of great concern for the uni · 
versity, as they should be for all of California." 

Lt. Gov. Gray Davis echoed Atkinson's con-
cerns in a statement also released on Tuesday. 

"These admissions figures demonstrate the 
troubling impact Proposition 209 has, and will 
continue to have, on California's future," Davis 
said. "Clearly, Prop. 209's legacy will result in 
fewer African Americans and Latinos who will 
be educated to contribute to their communities 
in a meaningful way." 

UC Board of Regents Chairwoman 
Meredith Khachigian, who voted in favor of 
SP- I, the regent 's resolution to eliminate aftir-
mative action admissions decisions, comment -
ed that she hopes people use the drop in minor-
ity admissions a ' a call to action. 

"The clear message us that all of California, 
not just the UC alone, must work harder to pre-
pare greater numbers of chi ldren from all back-
grounds 10 succeed in school and to motivate 
them to pursue a uni versity educati on," she 
stated. "This can only happen over tim . And 
the effort must begin with famili es, ex tend 
th rough the school system and engage every 
scgment of society, from individual volunteers 
and community organizations to private enter-
prises and the state and federal governments."

Candidate Alleges Campaign Finance Violations 
MONEY: Leventhal 
argues for abol ishing 
spending limits 
By erika Snider 
Staff Writer 

Spending limits on candidates 
for Associated Students (A .S.) 
offices will remain in place, 
according to A.S. allornc John 
Francis. 

Francis made thIS decision after 

Joe Leventhal, an independent can-
didate for A.S. president , com-
plained to Elections Manager Jaime 
D,rol.d that the restrictions placed 
on a candidate's ability to spend 
were in violation of the First 
Amendment. 

According to A.S. Election 
Bylaws, candidates running for the 
offices of president, vice-president 
or commissioner are limited to 
spending $200 on their campaigns. 
Candidates for senator are restrict-

cd 10 $50 for election expenditures. 
However, candidates can pool their 
resources together and form a slate 
in order to spend their campaign 
monies collectively. 

Leventhal, who is not running on 
a slate, .supported his objection in a 
letter to Drozd by citing the 1976 
U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the 
case of Buckle v. Valeo. According 
to this decision, any restrictions on 
the amount that an individual can 
spend on his election campaign arc 

in violation of the First Amendment 
because "these provisions place 
substantial and direct restrictions on 
the ability of candidates, citi l.cns 
and associations to engage in pro-
tected political expression." 

According to Drozd, both 
Francis and Director of Student 
Policy and Judicial Affai rs Nick 
Aguilar agreed that because the 
A.S. is an internal organization of 
UCSD, it is not subject to the

Miss America Discusses the 
Importance of HIV Prevention 
FORUM: Kate Shindle 
talks to 20 people in the 
Price Center Theater 
By Grace Jang 
Senior Staff Writer 

Miss America 1998 came to 
UCSD on March 13. 

Speaking at various college 
campuses across the nation on her 
platform, "On the Way to a Cure: 
Preventing HIV Transmission in 
America," Kate Shindle hopes to 
educate students about safer sc,.,. 

"In 1996, for the tirst time in 
history, the number of AIDS-relat-
ed deaths declined," she said. 
''That's encouraging news, but the 
tight against HIV is far from over 
.... HIV docs not discriminate, and 
it is spreading at unprecedented 
rates. Not only do two American 
teenagers contract HIV every hour, 
bUI worldwide there are 8,500 new 
infections every day." 

Appro,.,imately 20 people gath-
ered in the Price Center Theater to 
meet the Northwestem University 
senior, who has received criticism 
from those who say that she is 
advocating sexual promiscuity and 
fornication through her platform. 

"The controversy surrounding 
me has been because I support pro-

Drozd said. "We' re talking about

doms aren't effective 100 percent 
of the time, they shouldn't be di s-
tributed, That really crosses the line 
from disagreeing to being danger-
ous." 

Warren junior Sabrina Houlbert 
lauded Shindle for her "guts." 

''The reason why I came is 
because I think her platform is 
awesome," Houlben said. "I think 
it takes a lot of guts to go out and 
speak about a sexually tmnsmiHed 
disease." 

When asked whether she 
thought her work is effective, 
Shindle responded, "I don't know 
if bringing Miss America to town 
for 45 minutes necessarily will 
change anyone's behavior in the 
long term. I think my most effec-
tive role is served if 1 can al.:t as a 
catalyst for programs that arc 
already in place."

ence on testing services available 
on campus after Shindle recom-
mended ways in which studenlS

Shindle suggested that students 
educate themselves ahaut HIV and

"not be afraid to say no." 

Shindle also attempted to dis-
mantle "myths" of the Miss

"For years and years, Miss 
America was a beauty pageant," 
she said. "It was a ribbon-cutting

All of Society Responsible 
For Preparing Its Students 

In the first year that affirmative-action criteria 
were not used in University of California undergrad-
uate admissions, UCSD i1dmitted 40-percenr fewer 
appi'icants from underrepresented raciill-minority 
groups than last year. 

The small number of African American, Mexican 
American and Native American students admitted is 
especially alarming, considering that there is already 
a pitifully low number of students from underrepre-
sented racial-minority groups on campus. 

For instance, 1,639 of the 13,303 studenrs admitted 
to UCSD last year were racial minorities . This year, of 
the 13,141 studenrs accepted, o nly 965 are African -
American, Mexican-American or Native-American. 

If Ihe University of California truly intends to 
serve all the people of California, then the university 
should strive to have a student · body whose ethnic 
makeup is similano that ofCalifomia. Obviously, we 
are far from meeting this goal. 

Although it w0!lld be easy to blame the lack of 
rdCial minorities on the UC Regents f(,)r abolishing 
affinnative action, no one person or entity is entirely 
responsible fonhe lack of diversity in the University 
of California: However, some blame can surely be 
:prac~ on California's miser~ble public school system. 

j ,HQ~ cal) it be: pq~siblcr i~hat California, the richest 
_ st~le ,in A,merica. na,.., Oflt:1 of, the ·P09fest ,school .sy~- , 
terns in the country? How can we bui-Id new prisons 
while many schools in the slate are in shambles? 

In the wak~ of, the end of affinnative action. and in 
Qrder . to illC(ea~ " diversity at , the University of 
California. children from underrepresented I'acial-
minority-groups need to have the tools to be academi- ' 
'eally competitive'. These ~tudents Ot!ed the opportunity 

, to ~lIe~d g~ i~~·ix>is ,~at prepare ,them' for attendance 
at institutions li,ke UCSD. 

This can only be accomplished if more money is 
allocated to the public school system, and that money 
is well spent. 

It is important to note that the University of 
California has taken the first step in reaching out to 
students from underrepresented racial-minority 
groups. In particular, UCSD has placed full-time 
recruiters in Los Angeles and San Francisco to begin 
working with prospective students as early as ninth 
grade. In addition, UCSD may one day have a model 
school on campus for students from socio-economi-
cally disadvantaged communities. 

It should not only be the responsibility of the UC 
system to ensure that more students from underrepre-
sented racial-minority groups are eligible to attend 
the University of California. Instead, it should be the 
responsibility of California legis lators and citizens 
who watch students move through alifornia's public 
schools without ever rcally gai ning the skills neces-
sary to attend the University of Ca lifornia .

.. COMMENTARY: Reclaiming wastewater and purifying it for the tap will provide 
San Diego with a-reliable and clean source of water: oespite protesters' concerns 

. By Jenny Nicholson 
Staff Writer ' 
, 1/ makes up 75 percent of our body 

,. ina~s and covers three-quaners of. the 
Earth's sur'face but water seems to be 
the one thing that San Diego doesn·l 
have. . 

San Diego irnport~ its water for 
I. drinking, irrigation and, well, for just 

aboul everything. ' Because of this, 
there is a constant search for new 
methods of ' increasing San Diego's 
local water supply. Over the past sev-
eral years, Ihese supplies have been 
decreased by drought, groundwaler 
contamination, seawater intrusion and 
legal rulings limiting the amount of 
imported water. 

To combat these problems, San 
Diego has turned to a controversial 
water-reclamation program, more pop-
ularly know as the "toilet-to-tap" pro-
posal. The program is expensive, but 
the henclits of water reclamation arc 
well worth the cost. 

The proposed project would 
include II new or expanded water 
reclamation plants, a stale-of-the-art 
re-puri li cation faci lity, and hundreds 
of miles of delivery pipeline. The puri -
tied waler would be blended wilh 
runoff and imported waler in reser-
voi rs before heing di stributed 10 Ihe 
puhlic. 

Wa~tewater is San Diego's most 
abundan!. et Icast uliliLed, source of 
waler. In alifornia, Iwo million acre-
feel of waslewaler are produced annu-

Did the ~u"-y invest millions in 
the (eclamat~on project just to discard 
the water'! The program should he put 
into effect, rat~tt than become a need-
less draino on cit~ funds . . 

Some cringe at dri\lking water that 
was once i.n their toilel , but the fear is 
an ungrounded one. The reclaimed 
water would go through seven separate 
treatments, and has been certified safe 
by the California Department of 
Health Services. Once purified, the 
reclaimed water would then be wilh-
drawn by the city, filtered and disin-
fected before being supplied to water 
customers. 

Not only would the reclaimed 
water decrease San Diego's depen-
dence on imported supplies, the pro-
ject would keep wastewater out of Ihe 
ocean . Each day in San Diego, 
180,000 gallons of treated wastewater 
are dumped in Ihe ocean. If the recla-
mation project is approved, the city 
and the ocean would both benelit, as 
water that replaces San Diego depen-
dence un imported water would also 
reduce Ihe strain on the ocean. 

If reclamation is approved, Ihe cil Y

COMMENTARY: Rather than create a more efficient workplace, as was intended, personal computers on every desk, cellular 
phones in every pocket and other common technological advances have complicated and consumed our lives 

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES CONSUME OUR FREE TIME 
By Simone Santini 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

I am essentially a lechnologist. 
Although a good pan uf my work 
in computer science is theory, a 
good chunk of il is lechnological 
development. 

h seems natural , therefore, 10 
ask how lechnology is used and 
whether it is being used 10 increase 
the quality of Ii fe . At the same 
time, I am surprised to sec how lit-
tle the people involved in techno-
logical developmenl think aboul 
these mailers. 

The use of technology affects 
our society dramatically. At work, 
we are accustomed to using 
amazing technological tools -
from laptop computers to cell 
phones. We can now do more 
work in less time ; we can be more 
produclive. 

We could use this new-found 
productivity to case Ihe pressure of 
the work, 10 give us more lime to 
enjoy each other's company and 10 
pursue other interests. 

We could probably accomplish 
the goal that Bertrand Russell had 
70 years ago - a society in which 
four hours of work per day would 
be enough to produce whatever is 
necessary, leaving people free time 
for culture, entenainment, family 
and friends. 

We have not reached this goal. 
Using new technology is giving us 
longer hours, more pressure, more 
stress and less job security. 
Technology has blurred, at least for 
whilc-<.:o llar workers, Ihc dislin<.:-
tion between .work and free time -

ject would be $900 to $1,000 per 
acre-foot, a cost competitive with 
other water sources. 

The large amount of capital 
investment ' needed for the project 
would drain local resources, if state 
or government funding was not 
obtained. Although the costs for the

usually at the expense of free time 
- while failing to produce a more 
interesting and stimulating work-
place. 

The workplace has become 
more "dynamic." meaning I hat 
companies lay off workers as soon 
as a new general ion of cUlling-
edge employees hecomes avail -
able. On the other hand. individu-
als wilh marketable ski lis are per-
fectly happy to jump from compa-
ny 10 company to speed up their 
careers. 

The consequences of Ihis on our 
lifestyle and our society are not 
reassuring. Families move fre-
quently, hunting for new jobs, los-
ing their roots and becoming isolat-
ed. Parents work longer hours and 
are raising a generation of children 
they do not understand, but they do 
not know and fear. 

In spite of all the rhetoric about 
"family values," society increasing-
ly asks us to pUI our jobs in front of 
our family. In fact , there is enor-
mous pressure to put jobs hefore 
our family, quality of life, well-
being and everything Ihat should be 
a priority. 

Now, thanks to technology, 
many of us can work 24 hours a 
day from almost any place in the 
world. Every place with a phone 
jack or a cell phone can be instant-
ly transformed into an office. 

While this is not true for 
everyone, I suspect it will be true 
for a large majority of people 
who graduate r;om UCSD. There 
is no reason 10 think that Ihe 
pressure to put our job before 

program would be high, a reliable, 
local wal~r system for San Diego is 
well worth the price. Before the 
city bui Ids a stadium or expands the 
cOflvention center, it should direct 
funds to developments that San 
Diego truly need~. 

The city has already begun the 
project; it built the North City plant 
and etmently uses reclaimed water 
for non-potable purposes, includ-
ing irrigation and iqduslry. In fact, 
many counties across the nation , 
employ successful programs using 
re-purilied \;Vater for everythi~g but 

Weare missing 
some great 
opportunities to 
Improve the quality 
of life. Worst of all, 
the very people 
responsible for the 
development of the 
technology, which 
should be helping 
us, are too busy 
writing program. 20 
hour. a day with 
little or no time to 
even think about It. 
everything will not ex lend to 
most of our already scarce free 
time. 

Only a small portion of the pop-
ulation ~an fully benefit from new 
technologies. Progress in medicine 

, is useless if it is not affordable; 
much of Ihe world docs nOI have 
ready access 10 these exPensive 

drinking water. 
San Diego would be the first 

city in California, and the second in 
the nation, to use reclaimed water 
for potable uses. This would be a 
proper move, considering that San 
Diego imports 90 percent of ilS 
water, one of the highest percent-
ages in the nation. The city ~hould 
act quickly hefore that level gets 
any higher. 

While critics of the progrJm say 
that it is not feasible, the program 
has the support of the major state 
water pro~rams, the San Diego 

technologies. 
At one time. computers were 

regarded as a means to eliminate 
menial and repetitive lasks. It is 
true thai , in Ihe last live years, 
unemploymenl has steadi ly 
decreased - and this is in part due 
to technology. However. it is also 
lrue Ihat heing employed docs nOI 
guarantee an acceplable quality of 
life. For instance, in Ihe westem 
United Slales, 15 percent of the 
popUlation lives below Ihe poverty 
level. 

Technology has placed employ-
ees in a very complex network of 
relations, in which actions can 
inlluence a large number of people 
in unpredictable ways~ This social 
network requires informed and 
educated people, and technology 
gives us the lools 10 inform and 
educate people more efficienlly, al 
leasl in principle. 

In the age of easy salellite com-
munication, journalism is increas-
ingly fascinaled wilh irrelevant 
issues and its focus is more and 
more restricted to local banalities 
and gruesome stories of crime and 
sex (possihly together) . 

The educational system still 
has no idea of what to do with Ihe 
new network technologies. 
Everybody is trying to jump on the 
bandwagon with enthusiastic 
claims and promises that every 
classroom in America will he con-
nected to the Internet and that this 
will bring us into the Golden Age 
of education. 

Thi~- is very good if you are 
looking for a few easy votes, but 

C9\lnty Water Authority and many 
environmental organizations, includ-
ing the Sierra, Club. Also, in a recent 
survey, public opinion was finnly in 
suppon of lhe reclamation project 

This 'support should serve as a 
strong suggestion that reclamation 
would be a positive development in 
San Diego. 

As population increases and the 
availability of resource~ decreases, 
cities everywhere will havc to turn 
to recycling, rather than depending 
on fresh resources. 

Considering that the city is 

nobody seems to have a clue about 
what to do after we have the 
Internel in every dassroom. 

Arguahly, the very concept of 
classroom (intended ;\s an audilori -
um) could become obsolete. the 
role or lhe teacher could change 
dramalically and the whole 
approach to culture could he 
altered. I have seen no widely dif-
fused dehate on Ihese issues. Li ke 
mosl discourse about the impact of 
the new lechnologies on our social 
and cultural life, Ihe debate is thin-
ner than an oxide deposit on a com-
puter chip . 

All in all, technology is a posi-
tive thing. Rather than an anti-tech-
nologisl. think of me as a disap-
poinled technologist. We are miss-
ing some great opportunities to 
improve Ihe qualilY of life. 

Worst of all, Ihe very people 
responsible for the development 
of the technology, which should 
be helping us , are too busy writing 
programs 20 hours a day wilh lil-
tie or no time to even think about 
it. 

We are developing some fonni-
dable and far-reaching technolo-
gies thai will alIcct our lives like 
few things in our past We can 
decide to use them to improve our-
selves, our culture, our awareness 
and our quality of life. 

We can create a new humanism 
and a new Renaissance. We can 
also decide to use technology to 
make our social problems worse 
and to create a neurotic and captive 
society with Orwellian characteris-
tics. The choice is ours. 

already having difficulties main-
taining a steady water supply, San 
Diego should immediately institute 
programs to prepare for the 
inevitable decrease in available 
import supplies. 

San Diego should be prepared to 
be self-sutlicient when other areas 
join the search for reliable water 
sources, and at this point, water 
reclamation programs are the only 
true way of achieving indepen-
dence.

COMMENTARY: Students who consistently hold negative attitudes about 
UCSD should step back to admire its assets and appreciate its beauty 

STUDENTS SHOUL'D ApPRECIATE ART 
By Ilona Fass 
Hiatus Editor 

When r first arrived at CSD 
about a year ago, I was surprised at 
the l:ollective negativil)! thaI the 
students expressed, and at thei r 
quick and easy manner of making 
that opinion known quite well. In 
fact , it ccms that it is even fash-
ionable to speak poorly about 
UCSD. 

I was disheartened at having my 
eagerness stomped on by a pletho-
ra of more-experienced ICel . 1 was 
saddened the day, that I read an 
anicle in the Guardian devoled to 
"en lightening" fresh, unsuspecting 
students and listing happi Iy the 
things that would haunt my nex t 
four years. 

I beg to differ; I dare to go 
against the grain. I have the audac-
ity to stick my neck on the chop-
ping block, and have my head 
whal:ked off by disgruntled stu-
dents. There arc many things that 
place this campus a cut above the 
rest. 

The architecture and art are just 
a few things that stand out and set 
thi s campus on a level far higher 
than any other. 

UCSD is the onl}: campus that 
can boast of talking trees and a 
library that looks like somet hing 
out of a science-liction tilm. 

Some students complain about 
the artwork on campus, claiming 
it 's too weird or simply lacks aes-
theti l: value. 

Then they groan about the 
amount of money it costs to do that 
sort of thing. The truth is, though, 
that most of the anwork is donated 
by the Stuart Art Foundation, a pri-
vate group that linds i n ~ pired and 
inspiring artists. 

I'll admit that it is eclec tic. but 
isn't that what art is all ahour

and statues when we have our own 
marble drinking fountain in front of 
Eleanor Roosevelt College. 
According to the UCSD tour book, 
thi s fountain "mirrors the nearby 
monument to Camp Matthews sug-
gesting a connection between the 
institutions of defense and learn-
ing." Not only that , but it 's useful 
when you are thirsty. 

One of my favorite places to

Combined with the surreali sm 
of talking trees and little green

ADMIT: UCLA 
admits 5 percent 
less Caucasians 

Berkeley will differ signilicantly 
from last year. African-American, 
Mexican-Amcrican, Latino and 
Native-American students together 
comprise 10.4 perecnt of the l! ,034 
students admitted - a 54-percent 
drop from their proportions admit -
ted last year. 

At a press con ferel1l;e on 
Tuesday, UC Berke ley Chancellor 
Robert Berdahl said he is dismayed 
that the en tering clas~ is nowhere 
ncar as diverse as t he people of 
California. 

" I can tell you that personally, I 
am very disappointed that our enter-
ing «.:lass will not better represent the 
impressive di versity that distin -
guishes thi s state," he said . "I 
helieve that students learn from each 
other as much as they do from their 
classes and professors and that a stu-
dent body that is not as diverse as 
we have come to enjoy is a loss to 
the entire uni versit y community. " 

Berdahf also said he is worried 
lhat the lack of diversit y of the 
el1l cring class will discuurage chil -

• 

. dren from underrepresented racial-
minority groups from allending the 
University of California. 

"In the shon run, my greatest 
concern is that news of the substan-
tial drop in underrepresented-
minority students in the admit pool 
will serve to dampen the aspira-
tions of young students and those 
who advise them in junior high and 
high schools," he said. "Berkeley, 
as the oldest and preeminent puhlic 
university in California, has played 
- and should play - an impor-
tant role for all California students. 
We give the very best students a 
goal on which to set their sights ." 

Berdahl also pledged to do all 
he can to encourage the students 
from underrepresented racial-
minori ty groups thai were admitted 
to attend UC Berkeley. 

"I can tell you that thi s campus 
intends to do all that is possible to 
em:ourage Afril:an-American, 
Chicano, Latino ~\nd Native -
American students who have been 
admilled to enroll ," Berdahl said. 
" I will personally phone as many of 
these students as I can and I am 
asking our faculty and staff and stu-
dent leaders to join me in thi s 
efTort ."

underrepresented ral:ial-minority

Afril: ,l11 Americans experiem:ed the 
most substantial decline. 

African Americans comprise 2.4 
per«.:ent of the students admitted to 
UC Berkeley - a decline of 64.3 
percent from the proportion of such 
students admitted last year. A year

admitted to UC Berkeley for the 
fall semester. This year, 191 
African Ameri cans arc heing 
offered admi ss ion. 

Mexican Ameri l.:an s comprise 

5.5 percent of the students admilled 
at UC Berkeley for fall admission 
- a 56.3 percent drop from last 
year. Last year, UC Berkeley admit-
ted 1,045 Mexican-American appli-
cants, this year 434 were admitted. 

Chicanos comprise 2. I percent of 
all admilled students - a decrease 
of 21 percent from last year. Last 
year, 22 1 Latinos were admilled to 
the campus, as compared with 166 
Latinos admitted this year. 

Native Americans represent 0.3 
percent of the students admitted to 
UC Berkeley for fall - a decline 
of 58.9 percent from last year. Last 
year, 67 Native Americans were 
admilled, as compared with 27 
admitted this year. 

The number of Asian Americans 
admitted thi s year to UC Berkeley 
rose 7.7 percent from 2,925 last 
year to 2,998 this year. 

The nu I1Iber of Caucasians 
ad mitted this year increased 3.2 
percent from 2, 725 lasl year to 
2,764 this year. 

UCLA also experienced suh-
stantial decl ines in the number of 
underrepresented ra«.:ial minorities 
admitted, and UCLA Chancellor 
Alben Carnesale said he was very 
concerned with the lack of diversi -
ty in the admitted ChlSS. 

"I al1l com:erned that some seg-
ments of our community will be

inadequately represented in this 
freshmen class," Camcsale said. 
"We lake very seriously our 
responsibility to prepare leaders 
from and for every segment of the 
l:Ommunity." 

Out of the 10,600 students 
admitted to next year's freshmen 
class at UCLA, 12,5 percent identi-
fied themselves as either African 
American, MCKican American, 
Latino or Native American - 64 
percent less students than last year. 

The number of Afril:an 
Americans admitted to UCLA 
decreased 42.6 percent from 1,331 
last year to 280 this year. 

The number of Mexican 
Americans and Latinos admiued 
decreased from 3,711 last year 10 
1,497 this year. 

The number of Native Americans 
admitted decreased 43 percent from 
l! I last year to 46 this year. 

The number of Asian Americans 
admitted to UCLA increased slight-
ly from 4,154 last year to 4,1l!7 Ihis

The number of Caucasians 
admitted declined 5 percent from

Scharberg said the arrangement 
between the show's crew and UCSD 
has gone wel l, with few conflicts. 

"Our higgest problem was 
scheduling and trying 10 share Ihe 
facilities ," Scharherg said. 

There were some minor prob-
lems with lilming blocking students' 
passage to class, but, Scharbcrg said 
students were very accommodating. 

'There have been a couple times 
when people have had to get to 
class, but we only block traffic for 
ahcmt 30 seconds, and the students 
were very patient," Scharbcrg said. 

Second Assistant Director Scottie 
Gissel said the EI Nino rains that 
have lashed southern California 
caused no major delays in filming. 

"We haven ' t lost any days 
because of rain. hut we have had to 
juggle our schedule," he said. 
"There have heen some times we 
have shot in the pouring rain 
because it fit our purposes."

IKeeping the Traditionl 

Hepcat bring their traditional ska rhythms to RIMAe tonight 

Go to see a "ska band" these days and odds are you will wind up slam-dancing with a bunch of body-pierced, 
bleached-blond teenage skatepunks and 
teenybopper "Gwenabces" in wifebeat-
ers with jcwcls taped to their foreheads, 
listening to Goldfinger or Less Than 
Jake. 

That may be fun, but .it isn' t real ska. 
For authentic, mellow, calypso-inflect-
ed dance music, one has to look to Hep-
cat, a nine-man band out of Los Ange-
les. But to hear them, you 'd think they 
came right out of downtown Kingston, 
Jamaica. Hepcat recently signed to 
HellcatlEpitaph, a new Epitaph sub-
label founded by Brett Gurewilz and 
Tim Armstrong, guitarist for Rancid and 
legendary ska band Operation Ivy. 

Hepcat opens I'or Ben Harpt.!r tonight 
at RIMA Arena. The Guardian spoke 
with Hepcat ~axophoni s t Efren Santana. 
Guardian: Most of the times 
I've seen Hepcat, you've been 

playina small venues, and 
RIMAe I. about 3,000 seats. 
Do you think th.t this w. be a 
cIff ....... kind of show? 

Santana: We've done bigger shows 
all around the country and around the 
world. It 's just different in the situation 
that we're opening up for another act, 
and that's basically it. But nothing will 
change about our show; we ' ll playas 
hard as we ever have. Maybe a little 
harder. Nothing else will change, 
though. We ' ll play what we play. Our 
show will not adjust or conform because 
we ' re playing with someone else. We 
just do what we do, and we do it our 
way. 
How will it be playina to a dif-
ferent kind of c:rowd than 
you're used to? 

It will he interesting, just in the form 
of whal olher people wi ll think , bul 
we've done that with the Warped Tour. _ 
I know that at a lot of your 
shows, you see all the rude 

boys and skinheads in the IUd .. 
ence. Do you find that kind of 
audience to be more receptive 
to your music than maybe a 
more main ................ 1 

No, it's the same with every audi-
ence. Just because people are into the 
ska scene doesn't mean that they're 
actually going to dig our music or not 
dig it, you know'! It 's the same every-
where. Hopefully our music is good 
enough or they like it enough to actual-
ly buy a CD or buy a T-shirt or whatev-
er, cOlne back to another show. We 
always like people to come back. 
You IMntioned both show ..... 
CDs; do you enjoy one more 
than the other? 

I enjoy playing shows, personally. 
In listenine to the latest CD, I 
found that although it'. the 
same music, the shows seem 
a lot more engaging. 

Yeah. we've gOllen a lot of thu,c

-M it S ( ART I ~ .-,====-
Trust Us, Size Matters and Roni Is Here 10 Prove It 

British drum-n-bass gum Rani Size breaks through in the United States with his most recent album, NewForms 
By Adam Vadnais 
Staff Writer 

In the never·ending search for 
the next big thing, most new al:ts 
and styles rarely outlast the sea· 
son (we will always remember 
you, Marcy Playground), or never 
survive fully intact (people now 
put Smash Mouth and 3 11 into 
the area of ska) . The slow·mov· 
ing groups and artists who take 
their time outside of the spotlight 
usually make the higgest splash . 

British drum·n·hass maestro 
Roni Size has done just thaI. 

With his critically al:daimcd 
album NewForlll.l' (Mercury), 
which passed up Radiohead and the 
Chemica l Brothers for Britain 's 
Alhum of the Year, Size and the 
Reprazenl co llective have corne to 
illustrate what electronic music is 
all about. 

" .. m more exdted that the 
music is gelling to a whole new 
audicncc than I am worried that it 
might go into the mainstream ," 
Si7.e said in a reccnt intcrview with 
the CI/m·dilln . 

"But I am glad that we're CO lli · 
ing 10 give the music straight , you 
know that you'n: gClling the origi · 
nal people from the scene," he 
added. 

When asked ahOUI what intlu· 
enced him in his early days of 
music ·making, Size explained how 
the interal:tions hetween the United 
Stales and Brilaill have brought 
about Ihe sOllie major musical 
innovations. 

"When I first started listening to 
hip·hop. it blew my mind l " Size 
exdaimed. "But it wasn't thc real 
thing. it was an English version of 
what had come over from Ihe 
States. For you it would be like 
having your knowledge of jungle 
- the older. less polit ically correct 
name for drum·n·bass - from a 

group like Aqua. That's .why it's 
cool you're gelling the real th ing 
firs!. " 

What makes an artist like Size 
and a scene like drum· n· bass 
inreresti ng is that while you may 
not own an album that is entirely 
pure drum·n·bass, cham:es are one 
of your fa vori te acts has done a 
remix with Size or one of his fel · 
low DJs . 

One of Size 's more recenl 
remixes was for the laiesl En Vogue 
alhum. There arc also rumors /ly. 
ing ahout the Inlernet about Size's 
plan 10 work with evcryone from 
Soul Coughing to Blackst reet. 

Dn.lln·n·bass has been around 
for years, but largely unrecog· 
niz.ed. ACl:o rding to Size, the most 
exciting thing to him is how the 
youth of today will take the music 
coming out now and make it their 
own . 

" I had rap and hip·hop, but it 
was n,')t my own, il was American," 
Sile explaim:d. "I li~tened to reg· 
gae. hut that was Jamaican . so I had 
to find whal I fclt expressed 11l )'~clf 
I he best. I I:an' t wait to see what 
these kids li ~ t e nillg to Illy ~Iuff 
come up with ," 

While many musicians and 
SP() rI ~ s tar~ claim they ~hould n t 
bc considered rofe mod..:l~, Sill! 
takes a different approach . When 
he WOIl the Merwry Pri7c, 
Britain 's most prestigious award , il 
came with it check for £25,000. 
Rather than pockel iI, Size gave it 
10 the Basement. a youth· music 
resource for marginalized young 
people that provides training 
opportunities in music, technology 
and sound recording. The Base· 
ment is a place for troubled youths 
in Size 's home town of Bristol, a 
place where Size found solace 
when he was young. 

Although he admits to not being

Welcome to our new weekly 

feature, Picks & Pans. We figured 
Ihat since all the other sections had 
a weekly column, why don'l we 
have one too'! Here you'll find 
many di fferent views on various 
enlertainment topics. assuming we 
can coercc people into actually 
writing a column for us. 

Before I get into the heart of Ihis 
article, we are still looki~g for 
someone to be an editorial assistant 
for Hiatus. This assistant will take 
over for us as section editor next 
year, so if you think you can do it, 
get down here and talk to us pron-
to. 

Anyway, the point of this par· 
ti cular column is to ramhle on 
about my spring hreak on the East 
Coast. I ventured off 10 visil my 
old roommate Jeremy in Boston, 
where jaywalking and chain·smok· 
ing arc the most popular pastimes 
and the locals say amusing Ihings 
like "clam chowdah" and "wicked 
(insert adjective here}." By the end 
of the week I developed what I 
thought was a pretty good imita· 
ti on of a Boslon accent , but 
nollod)' I tried il on found it very 
funny. 

First I want to start off with a 
celebrity anecdote. The firsl day [ 
was there, I was walking 10 Har·

much more to do in San Diego. 

For instance, in San Diego there 
are a ton of movie theaters, most of 
which have a Ion of screens. How· 
ever, in Boston I think there are 
about six theaters , which probably 
combine for a total of 30 screens or 
so. Where do peoplc sec movies i~ 
that city? Maybe California is jusl 
into " bigger and bellcr:' hut il 
seems like there is hardly any 
selection of movies, plus you have 
In travel to lind a theater. 

I nOliced anOlher cultural differ· 
ence in the live music scene. Jere· 
my and I went to see Lagwagon al 
Ihe Middle East Cafe, which is as 
unlikely a musie venue as you ' ll 
lind anywhere. During the day it is 
a restaurant se rving Middle·East· 
ern cuisine. but every night of the 
week it has musical acts in Ihree 
separate rooms. The night we were 
Ihcre it had Lagwagon in the down· 
slairs room. sOl11e acous li c duo in 
the upstairs roo 111 . and a bell)' 
dancer ill the main restaurant area. 

I saw Lagwugoll once hcfore at 
SOMA and I wasll't 100 impressed 
with their liw show, so I wa~I1 ' 1 
rcally expecti ng much fmlll them 
on tha~ particu l,t r night. However. 
they were great. Thc Midd le Ea~t

which is the way it's supposed to 
be. At this show, the pit was just a 
mess of guys nailing around like 
electrocuted monkeys, swinging 
their arms (and fists) wildly, hilling 
each other and anyone else who 
happened to be close. 

Jeremy infonned me that it was 
always like this, and thallhis was a 
good pit, for East Coast shows. 
Had I been close enough for them 
10 hit me, I would have been 
pissed. 

Another thing they do over 
there Ihat ( didn't understand at all 
is this: Ihey stand at one end of the 
circle, line up with somebody 
standing at the edge. and run at full 
speed and jump on them. They find 
Ihis really amusing, and it usually 
results in lots of hand shaking and 
laughing afterwards. All it made 
me wanl to do is calch Ihem in 
midair and body slam thelll . A lot 
of people got hurt that night , more 
than ('ve ever seen at a punk show 
in California. 

That same day I was talking to 
Jeremy 's room male. Winona. and 
she said that we shou ld go down 10

boyfriend 's band play. I wa~ skepti · 
cal about thi s plan , because I 
thought Rhode Island had a popula-

Rhode Island had a great music

-•••• 
As a rollow-up Lo their 1996 

major-label dehut , Destructioll By 
De/inition, Detroit 's Suicide 
Machines have re leased Bailie 
Hymns, a white-hot flash o r 
punk/sku rury that transcends the 
power of it s preliecessor. 

On Bailie Hymns, The Suicide 
Machines deli ve r hrutally frank 
songs that paint a di scolon.:d por-
trait or America without heating 
around the bush. The alhum's 22 
songs clock in at harely over 30 
minutes, and only four last over 
two minutes in length. 

BOllie H y ll//l .\' takes Destruc-
tioll 's raw blend of punk and ska 
and pushes it up a few notches. The 
Suicide Machines jump from 
smooth ska grooves to hlistering 
hardcore in the blink of an eye, sig-
nifying a violent shift in mood. This 
raw energy is what gives BOllle 
Hymll.l· its strength. The begi nning 
of the album set ~ the tone for the 
rest, kil:king olT wi th the houney 
~k a of "Sollleone," which in turn 
rades into the frantic, minute-long 
thrasher. "Hating Hate ." 

The hand s()und~ considerahly 
ti ghter th an it doe~ on /)e.~/rIl (' /j()l/ . 

B u M 
The rhythm section of bassist 
Royce Nunley and drummer Erin 
Pitman provides a thundering back-
bone for Dan Lukacinsky 's thick-
wall-or-guitar noise and singer 
lason Navarro 's ranting vocals. 

On Barrie Hymns, the band 
writes from the perspective or its 
urban upbringing. It tackles such 
issues as hatred ("Hating Hate"), 
elitism ("High Society"), greedy 
corporations ("Strike") and judg-
mental people ("Speak No Evi l"). 

The anger and fru stration 
expressed on Bailie HYIlln.\' reflects 
The Suicide Machines' attitude 
toward the state of the world, but 
there is also an underlying ense of 
optimism and positivity displayed 
in songs such as "Hope" and "Face 
Another Day."

In his solo debut, 12 Bar Blues, 

Weiland seems alone and confused. 
Granted, the Santa Cruz native has 
an amazing pop voice and is a 
song writing aficionado in his own 
righl. But without the DeLeo broth-
ers (Dean and Roo, STP's guitarist 
and bassist) adding their piece of 
Ihe "plush" pie, Weiland hasn't got 
a leg to stand on . 

By playing most of the instru-
ments on the album, Weiland 
allempts an experiment that paid 
orf for so lo-masters Beck and 
Lenny Kravitz. Unrortunately, Wei-
land just can ' t put the pieces 
together - 1'2 Bar Billes is an 
admirable attempt at avant-garde 
garage rock, but it never fully jells.

school beat-boxes are all that Ii II

he croons, "Come and save me from 
my misery/ Can't you sec Ihat it 's a 
disease! Shoot the bad guys and I'll

While Weiland 's fans are all 
waiting for him to sober up, they 
will have to wait for him to find 
himself and win his personal bat -

the 4uagmire that is the misguided

Hepcat 
Right On Time 

-•••• 
Hepl:at are Ihe besl li ve ska act 

currently performing (with the pos-
sihle exception of Let's Go Bowl-
ing) . Seeing these guys perform in 
a small, hot club is like stepping 
through a time warp into down-
town Kingston, lamaica, circa 
1967. This is all too rare in a genre 
which has hewme so hackneyed 
Ihat most conlemporary "ska" 
hanel ' wou ldn ' l know Desmond 
Dekker or Toots Hi hben if either 
wa lked up and beat the crap oul of 
their Airwa lk-wl:aring, multi -
pierced "a iternati ve" a .' se~. 

Hepcat's mellow. ~unny tune~ arc 
truc to the original sound and ~pirit of 

ska. The tunes show clear influences 
or Caribbean calypso, mento and 
bluebeat as well as classic American 
soul. Hepcal's music will make you 
want to jump up and immediately 
stan dancing like an idiot. 

That said, Right On Ttme, Hep-
cat 's third album, is somewhat dis-
appointing. Coming from almost 
any other band, this album would 
be incredible, consisting as it does 
of consistently catchy, upbeat tracks 
with excellent performances from 
all band members; musically, Hep-
cat is ru; tight as any seasoned jazz 
ensemble could ever hope to be. 

However, compared to the irre-
sistible energy or their li ve shows. 
RiXht 011 Ttme seems a bit hum-
drum. Despite standout tracks such 
as "Rudics All Around" and "Open 
Season ... Is Closed," this is music 
that 's meant to be danced to and per-
formed, not passive ly listened to. 

Admitted ly. thi s is a minor criti -
cism. So remember, the next time 
Hepcat plays the Showcase or Ihe 
Belly Up, these guys will put on a 
show Ihat you won 't forget. Until 
then. if you want to hear what real 
ska sounds like, RighI 011 Tillie is a 
good place to start.

vocal duties. Musically, they were 
very good, and I part icularl y 
enjoyed the sped-up cover or Pink 
Floyd's "Another Brick In The 
Wall Part 2." 

The second hand was a sku band 
from Providence l:alled The 
Agents. They were good too, and 
the crowd was really into the 
music. The Agents had kind of a 
second -wave vihe. and they 
reminded me a 101 of The Specials. 
The only prohlem was that the 
horns were a lillie too prominent. 
I' ve dec ided that I'm tired of horns 
in ska hands. 

Gruvis Malt were the headlin ing 
hand, the one we came to see. This 
hand is one of the hest amateur 
bands I have ever seen, and I 
wouldn ' t he surpri sed if it got hig 
rea ll y fas t. 

Gruvis Malt are kind of a hip-
hop/funk/R&B group. a hit li ke

hers arc all very talent cd nUlsicians. 
and they performed with a ~tage 

presem:~ far heyond their youth (all 
the hand mernhers were relalively 
young. I X or 19 ). The two vocali sts 
had :l fairly solid handle on rap. and 
the complex instl1lmelltatioll was 
great.

comments. I think our CDs do play 
well. and a lot of people like them 
and enjoy li stening ti, them, but it's 
like with a lot of hands that are con-
sidered more "underground." The 
CDs arc good, actually really good, 
but the shows arc so much mor\.! . 
you know'! 
The issue is that you guys 
are a really good live band, 
isn't it? 

We work rea lly hard at heing a 
li ve band. I mean, you buy a CD 
and you like the songs. hut when 
you go and sec a show, you wa nt 
peuple 10 go "Yeah, Ihat was bad, it 
was different. it was better th;lIl 
whal it was 011 the CD," which is 
what we go for. We try to do a real -
ly g()(xl jnh on the CD. the heM joh 
that WI.! can, hut after awhi le, we've 
been playing and playing the same 
~ol1gs over. But we lind little dif-
feren t thinp to do here and there, 
and if you h.now the songs rea ll y

Compared to a lot of other 
[ska] bands, you guys don't 
seem to do a whole lot of 
covers, other than a few 
Skatalites songs. 

Yeah, we do ,ome Skata lites, 
and we do a loe White cover. A lot 
of our covers arc thc really old ' oOs

It seems like a lot of pe0-

No, we've always looked at our-

Not really as part of a 
movement? 

We' re part of it , to an extent , hut 
the band feels that we' re more than 
just thai , than just a scene hand, 
you know'! We've always felt that. 
We started olT in the scene, and 
we ' ll take anything away from 
being part of Ihe scene. I mean, 
we're grateful to those fan s, hut we 
always get other people. San Diego 
is good proof of that ; we go playa 
show out there, and maybe less 
than hal f of the audiem:e is people 
t hat arc actually in t he scene and 
the rest are like regular peopk. 
Is there a reason that most 
of your San Diego shows 
have been held at 21·and-
up venues, such as the 
Belly Up Tavern? 

That's just the way it works out, 
there 's no real rea~on why. 
The crowd at 21-and-up 
shows is different than 
crowds at shows for all 
ages, isn't it? 

ple are just t ...... to drink 
or Eet rowdy, but at the all-
ages ones people just go to 
have fun and dance. Which 
do you prefer? 

Yeah, that's what we li ke. We 
like people to come out and danl:c. 
That's one reason we play what we 
do, because we enjoy people danc-
ing. You know, you can bring you r 
girlfriend out and dance wi th her .. . 
that 's what makes us happy, 

bc~ause we're almost all ba(;helors. 
So what are your plans for 
the futu ... ? Do you have 
another album in the 
works? 

No, not yet. We' re still working 
on this one, you know it just came 
out Jan. 20, so we ' re sti ll touring 
and supporting it. We've been on 
thc road so much, supporting that 
album with shows here and there. 
We' lI always do our own headlin-
ing shows; some people don't like 
to go see us as a supporting act. We 
choose who we play with very 
carefully, its not just like, "Oh, they 
want us 10 play and it 's good 
money." It 's not like thaI. 
Ben Harper has a really 
loyal following, doesn't he?

We' re in the works right now on

what it 's going to be or what song

find a director. Our budget isn 't 
that big, we' re not going to make

We just came back from over-

UCSD Sports Clubs 
RUGBY 

A lengthy layoff can make even 
the best learns rusty. With spring 
break memories still looming in the 
minds of its players (for those that 
can remember their spring breaks 
that is), the UCSD men's rugby 
team was all the more distracted 
coming off its three-week hiatus. 
However, UCSD remembered its 
winning ways quickly in a contest 
last Saturday against Occidental 
College. 

Despite the dirty play of Occi -
dental : UCSD he I! off the rush to 
retain a 30-14 lead and a victory 
whidl improves its record to 5- 1 in 
league and leaves it in a position 
for the second seed in the playoffs. 

The physical nature of Occiden-
tal's players forced UCSD to 
respond in kind with squahs that 
had the referee threatening to eject 
players if the lighting continueu. 
While UCSD loned it down, Occi -
dental continued it s cheap shots, 
but was unahle to get the offense 
needed to win . 

The scoring hegan with a penal-
ty ki(;k converted from tlyhalf 
Andy "Wi lma" Wilga to put UCSD 
on top, 3-0. Hard running from the 
aggressive Occidental forwards 
resulted in a try 10 minutes later, 
pUlling Occidental ahead, 7-3. 

At the 33-minute mark of the 
first half, UCSD fought back with a 
commined blocked kick by sopho-
more flanker Brian Kennedy, 
which allowed outside center Dar-
ren "Wolfman" Garb to scoop up 
the loose ball and carry it the length 

of the field for a try. Wilga fol-
lowed with lhe conversion puuing 
UCSD back on lOp, 10-7. Another 
try by Garb put UCSD up al half-
time, 17-7 . 

In the second half, both learns 
sparred aggressively, but UCSD 
would not allow its opponents to 
get any closer. Wilga sl:ored anoth-
er penalty kick and had a success-
ful drop ki ck early in the hair. 
while Kennedy scored the linal try 
of the game, giving UCSD the 30-
14 victory. 

"We were obvious ly rusty w m-
ing olT the long layoff," Head 
Coach Tim 0 ' Hara said . "Oxy 
came out aggressively and we did 
not have an immediate response, 
hut Ithink our club cleaned it up in 
thc end." 

UCSD travels to the Santa Bar-
bara Tournament this weekend 
hefore the regular season final e, 
April II , against Cal Lutheran Uni -
versity.

MEN'S 
LACROSSE 

The phrase "close bUI no cigar" 
aptly describes the UCSD men 's 
lacrosse match against the cow tip-
pl:rs of UC Davis la t Monday. 

UCSD cou ld not overcome the 
5- 1 delicit it unfortunately had at 
the hands of the Aggies. Despite a 
fourth-quarter spurt in which 
UCSD knolled the score at 9, its 
efforts were too lillie too late. as it 
eventually fell, 13-10. 

Penalties lOoming from hoth 
teams as well as their benches 
hi ghlighted the intense playas both 
teams rought hard to gain control 
of the gaml:. A fler the horrendous 
lirst quancr, the UCSD stick-wield-
ers began to rev the engine as they 
out scored UC Davis, 3-2, in the 
second. The squad still founditsdf 
down by 3 goals, a dilTerenre that 
would mirror the final score. 

The heginning orlhe linal quar-
ter had all the makings o r an 
incrediblc comeback when Frank 
Lemes went crazy with 3 goals in a 
mere four minutl!~ . All such hopes 
were dashed, however, as Davis 
fired right back with 3 goa ls of it s 
own. 

Eric Van Sluytens capped 
UCSD's swring with its 10th goal. 
hut alas, it was not cnough. 

UCSD squared oil against the 
Toreros from nearby USD yester-
day. but results were unavailable. 
However, another chance to get out 
and represent UCSD comes at 
home this Saturday as Occidental 
visi ts UCSD's Pryatcllield .

WOMEN'S 
ULTIMATE 
DISC 

The East Coast held adventure 
for the UCSD women's ultimate 
disc team last week when it played 
16 games in nine days against some 
prestigious teams. Unfortunately. 
the Irip also held misfortune as five 
of the 15 players on the team sus-
tained injury in a grucling week of 
East-Coast action. 

Before flying hack to San [)iego 
last Sunday, UCSD competed in 
the Joint Summit Classic Tourna-
ment in Clemson, S.c. which 
began on Friday. There, tired and 
worn out from the week 's prior 
games, UCSD fell to the top-five 
s.:eded teams, hut did manage one 
win against Savannah, Ga. 

Before the Joint Classi.:, UCSD 
kicked olT its week in the Universi-
ty of Maryland Kobyashi Maru 
Tournament , snatching third place. 

Facing temperatures helow 40 
degrees Fahrenheit, UCSD ' braved 
the clements wilh icicles dripping 
[rom its nose and plumes of steam 
tlowing from ils mouth. 

A loss in the semifinals to 
Princeton barred UCSD from the 
finals , but put them in position to 
grab third place. 

"Wc expected to see Cornell in 
the final game," Erin Hashimoto 
said. "But, we came up short in the 
game ... we picked up our playa lit-
tle too late."

Tritons ~an Trust Monday 
ANIEA1ER: UCSD opened strong in Irvine, but Tuesday was disappointing 
By Sean R .... mI 
Senior Staff ~iter 

EI Nino doesn't seem to want to 
play nil:c these days. Evcrywhere 
you look, it seems to have an 
impa.:t, and it 's rarely a 
positive one. 

Take a sport like golf. 
When the sun is out. the 
l:hallenges of a golf wursc 
it self arc enough to turn 
some hairs gray. Anyone 
who has tried to hit the 
green from 160 yards 
away with a 5-iron from 
the rough knows what I'm talking 
about. 

Now imagine the same shot 
with swirling winds and pouring 
rain thtH turns your cluh into frog 
legs in your hands. 

Not thai the UC Ir vi ne Anteatcr 
Invitational at Coto de Caza Coun· 
try Cluh - an evcnt mostly com-
prised of Division I powcrhousl:s 
like UC LA , Stanford and UC 
Berkeley - wa~ drl:ll(;hed by rain, 
hUI the unpredil:tahle weat her of 
thc pa~t two months havc made 
most golfers wcary. 

Nonethckss, I he tourney fea -
tured some great individual play. 
including UCSD' ~ own Dann ' ul -
livan. Sullivan came OU I ~l1Ioking 
on Monday, ~hooting a 2-undcr 70 

followed by a 72. He found himself 
jusl a stroke hehind UCLA's Jason 
Semelsbcrger. 

"Sullivan 's play on Monday was 
unhclievablc, the stuff that stars arc 

made of," Triton Hcad 
Coal:h Mike Wydra sa id . 
"We were the worst tcam 
on paper among all thc 
Division I squads. but we 
did well on the first day 
and proved that we could 
hang with the big boys." 

As a team, the Tritons 
playcd two great rounds 

on Monday - 303 and 305 -
placing them right in the middle of 
Ihc pack. Senior Jeremy Byrd shot 
rounds of 74 and 80. Fellow senior 
Grcg Uberuaga was close behind 
wi th a 76 and 79, and Greg Johnson 
rou nd.:d ou t the fou r -man Sl:ore 
with a 77 ~nd 80. James Donahoe 
wasn' t too far behind - accumu-
lating Sl:or.:s of 81 and 82 on Mon-
day. 

No one. however, was more dis-
appoin ted than UCLA's Brandon 
DiTu llio. DiTulli o opcned the tour-
ncy wilh the morning 's hest round 
- an impressive 69 - hut sank 
like thc Titallic in th.: afternoon as 
hl: ~hot a 30-over 102 for the dubi -
ou, honor of the tOllrnamenl ' ~ 

Tuesday brought with it some 
nasty weather. A l:ombination of 
winds and overconlidencc sank the 
Tritons to 19th plaee after a total 
score of 320 on Tuesday. 

Sullivan could not keep up his 
torrid pal:e on Tuesday ei ther, lin · 
ishing with a 82 and tying for 24th 
place ovcrall. 

"The weather was different on 
Tuesday," Wyd ra said. "And that 
makes a differenl:e, but I think we 
got a little complacent lafter Mon· 
day's good showing). EI Nino has 
cost us a couple of events. but I 
think it 's just a bump in the road. I 
don ' t see it affecting us in mid-
April or during May's champi· 
onships. Wc just have to fOl:uS on 
qualifying for Nationals. 

"Our squad is pretty much set 
with Sullivan, Donahoe, Byrd and 
Johnson: ' Wydra con tinued . 
"Uberuaga, Kcvin Pietri and Mall 
Cassarini wi ll battle it ou! for the 
Ii fth spot." 

UCSD will have a cou ple of 
morc matches thi s month. indud-
ing the annual hattie against thc 
San Diego Golf Al:ademy on April 
27. 

If th..: Tritons wa nt 10 repeat Ihe 
title perforrnanl:e of 1993. they wi ll 
have to havc more days like Mon· 
day and fcwer ones like Tucsday.

NDIAYE: 
Frustrated Tar Heel should 
be ashamed of himself 
Continued from page 24 

No one is blaming: Ndiaye for being upset. 
Aftcr all , his team was one vil:tory away from 
playing in college haskethall's higgest game. 
Ndiayc had played miserahly. contrihuting 
more than hi s share to the Heel's defeat. Start-
ing al center, Ndiaye wmpiled zero points. 2 
rchounds,5 fouls and an unncl:cssary forearm 
shiver to Utah 's Alex Jensen. 

Howevcr, to take his frustration and false· 
Iy accuse a fellow w llegiatc of racist remarks 
is unl:alled for. To play the ra l:e card on co l· 
lege haskethall 's grandcst stage, knowing fL)11 
well the aCl:usations were wmplctely rai se 
takes more than heing upsct. 

That requires one to be morc than even 
very upset ; it requires one to be ignorant or 
the ral:ialtensions that persist in 20th-ccntury 
America. 

"You just don ' t falsely al:CUSC people of' 
racism," UNC Chanl:ellor M il:hael Hooker 
stlid. 

Forget the championship game and the fal:t 
that Ndiaye's adions compromised. Ulah's 
preparation and concentration for Monday's 
matchup with Kentucky. 

The ramifications of Ndiayc's falsc al:Cu·

Tritons overcome losing 
streak with solid pitching 
Continued from page 24 
on the season. 

With the start of the new quarter, Ihe Tri · 
tons regrouped and sought a fOl:uS for the rest 
of the season. Rather than looking at the 
entire Sl:ope of the season, UCSD is looking 
at its games piece hy piece. 

"We arc taking the rest of the season one 
inning at a time," O' Brien said. 

In conjunction with Major League Base· 
ball's opening day. UCSD trave led to Pomona 
to take on Claremont College, hoping 10 end 
il s five-game slide one inning at a time. 

II was a close one, but the Trilnns rallicd 
laIC to beat Clarc munt , 11 ·8, improving thcir 
rccord to 8- 1 J. 

Tuesday 's game had a Sl:ary start for 
UCSD, ,h Triton starter Theo Rohin ~ lOok a 
hailed hall 01'1' his wrist in Ihe hOIlOIl1 of Ihe 
lirst inning. Th.: injured Rohins will he forced 
to watch hi s teammates for the next Ihr..:e to

LaPlante said. "Her douhb is improving. and

satiolls go far beyond a .game. two players, 
two teams and thc 1998 college basketball 
season, They will haunt the larger realm of 
athletics for a long tiple, long aftcr the 'Cats 
have hoisted the troplly in Lexington. 

In an era when ral:e is of enorm ous con-
tention in sports, a time th at has witnessed 
Latrell Sprewell, Bill Romanowski and Mar-
tinsville, Ind., Ndiayc's actions reprcsenl 
more than a step bal:k in the mardl toward 
rodal equanimity. Ndiaye has opened a door 
to socicty that would havc becn helll:r left 
closed: he has givcn sOl:iety a reason 10 ques· 
ti on an athlctc's claim that he has bcen sub-
jCl:ted 10 a raci al slur or ral:ist act. 

Society wi ll usc the door. I can already 
hear it now. the aCl:used claiming that the 
aCl: user is mercly "pulling a Ndiayc"; socicty 
will quest ion credibility in a case that it 
should not be quesli oned. 

Mahktar Ndiaye cried wolf, played the 
ral:e card knowing full well he was bluffing 
and knowing all too well he didn' t havc thc 
hand to bal:k it up . Monday's "s hini ng 
moment" was far from bright. 

Oh yeah, on the samc night that Ken-
tucky 'S lir~t black wadl, Tuhby Smith, won 
the National Championship, Adolph Rupp's 
widow, Esther Rupp , passcd away. Adolph 
Rupp was Ihe Kentudy icon who onl:e 
refused 10 rCl:ruit black players. Thc Ndiayc 
incident overshadowed the irony. 

the season. 
"Dave pitched well, espcl:ia lly considering 

he had no idea he was goi ng 10 pitdl ITues-
day) ," O'Brien said. "Eddic was also stron g. 
The success of ITuesday'sl game was withoul 
a doubt a team effort ." 

In Tuesday's viclory there were several 
so lid bats. Catl:her Jess Warrington had a 
strong showing with 3 RBis on 2 hits . Mason 
improved on his .406 average going 3 for 5 
with a pair of RBis. Hi II also brought two Tri-
tons across homc plate, for his 19th and 20th 
RBi s of the season. In the game. ESl:anuelas 
singled twil:e. 

All in all , it was a good day for the Tritons. 
as UCSD got its lirst victory in li ve games. 
In addition, thc Tritons showcd they had a lot 
of character going hig in Ihe top of the scventh 
to takc the lead. 

"Wc 've been building a lot of l:haractcr all 
s.:ason . The weather has definitely heen a fa l:-

0 ' Brien said. "Thc succcss for the rest of the

By Steve Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

One of the most overused and 
cliched terms in sports is that of a 
team is "in a must-win situalion." 

This is often a ploy by 
sports writers to generate 
allention for a team that is 
slruggling (see headline) 
but not necessarily in a do-
or-die situation for the 
next game. 

Well, forget ahout all of 
that hype stuff because the 
UCSD men's volleyball 
team is truly in a must·win situa-
tion when it squares ofT with Divi-
sion III rival University of La Verne 
on Friday. The poslseason is offi-
cially at stake. 

Despile being ranked No. 4 in 
the nalional Division III poll, the 
Tritons are still at risk of not mak-
ing the Invitational National Cham-
pionship because rival La Verne 
holds a higher ranking. 

The tournament extends only 
one invitation to a team from the 
Western Region. 

To make matters worse, in the 
lirsl match of the sealion, UCSD 
lost a live-game hearttlreaker to the 
Leopards that has severely hin -
dered its postseason hopes since 
then. 

If that is not enough to deem 
thi s match ,; must win for the Tri-
tons. Ihen consider Ihut La Verne is 
l;( )Jning ofT un upsel win against 
Division I Sun Diego Stale Ihul 
strengthens its hold on the Western 
slol. 

The si tuation becomes even 
more perilous for UCSD us it musl

PACIFIC LIFE 
A PlKific Mutu.l ~ 

travel to La Verne to play in one of 
the. strangest and least volleyball· 
friendly gyms around. 

Plagued with poor lighting and 
designed like a circus tenl, the 

Leopards' pitifully con-
structed gym will demand 
enormous t:Oncentration 
from Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland's squad -
which will also face a 
notoriously hostile home 
crowd. 

In their lirst mah;hup, 
the Tritons looked like 

they were well on their way to a 
win after capturing the lirst two 
games, but La Verne would not 
fold. 

Instead, the Leopards PUI 
together a strong comeback in the 
third game and then knotted the 
match at two games apiece when 
the Tritons failed 10 close out the 
important fourth game. 

In the lifth and deciding game, 
the normally reliable sideout of 
UCSD failed to work its magic and 
the Tritons saw the match slip 
away. 

UCSD comes into this bailie 
against La Verne after playing a 
rigorous spring break schedule that 
was loaded with competitive 
matches. 

Making up for a cancdcd road 
trip carlkr in Ihe year due to EI 
Nifio. the Tritons headed north to 
face UC Santa Barhara and UC 
Santa Cruz. 

Against the Division I Gauchos 
of UCSB, UCSD stru gg led early 
but did manage to tino some hright 
spots as seniors Jon Yarri s and Alan 

Dawber anchored the Triton 
offense. 

It would not be enough howev-
er, as UCSB made full use of its 
height and knocked off the Tritons 
in three games. 

Things were much more friend-
ly against the Banana Slugs of UC 
Santa Cruz. 

Facing the third team challeng-
ing for the Western spot at Nation-
als, the Tritons made sure that their 
game was top nolch as they picked 
up a much-needed victory against 
the Slugs. 

The Slugs' loss eliminated them 
from contention for Nationals and 
inlensilied the importance of the 
upcoming match for UCSD against 
LaVerne. 

To close OUI their spring break. 
Ihe Tritons faced a pair of Division 
I powerhouses, including the No. 1-
ranked Pepperdine University. 

Coming off a pair of upset loss-
es, the Waves were eagerly antici -
pating their match against the Tri· 
tons. 

Peppcrdine proved why it held 
the No. I ranking, .taking care of 
UCSD in three straight games. 

The Tritons met a similar fate 
against Cal State Northridge. as the 
Matadors knocked off the visiting 
Tritons in three straight. 

UCSD will have to have its best 
game of the season against La 
Verne as the Tritons play in their 
most impOllant match of the se~l­
son. 

With a shot at the National 
Championship hanging in the bal-
ance for the Tritons, this is a lIlust-
win situation.

Slow Start Overshadowed By Five-In-A-Row 
CUMBING: Florida vacation sends Tritons back to La Jolla with increased confidence for the upcoming drive into postseason run 
By Jake Gordon 
Staff Writer 

You can feel it. The signs are all 
aroll nd us. The air smells a lillie 
sweeter. and the grass seems a lillie 
greener. 

Despite EI Nifio's men-
acing adval1l;es, the sun is 
hreaking though the 
clouds a lillie more often . 
The birds arc singing in 
the trees as eve ryone 
returns from a nice. long, 
relaxing week in the tropi -
ca l destinations of choice. 

There is a feeling of rejuvena-
tion and happiness as the new quar-
ter begins. There can be no denying 
it; spring is finally here. 

This is the time of year when 
thoughts of March Madness fade , 
and visions of diamonds dance in 
our heads. The sounds of spring are 
familiar - the crack of the bat . the 
smack of ball meeting glove. the 
lirm call of the umpire and the 
cheers from the gallery. Yes, soft-
ball season is still going strong, and 
UCSD is no e,.;ception. 

The Triton softball team 's tropi -
cal destination was Orlando. Fla. as 
Head Coach Patti Gerckens took 
her softball squad down to the 
Rebel Games for some rest, relax -
ation and tough Division III com-
petition . It returned with a 14-8 
record, a strong sense of team unity 
and ki lIer tans. 

At the Rebel Games, the Tritons 
went 5-3. They started slow. losing 
their lirst three games, but then 
bounced back. ralliing off tive vic -
tories in a row. 

UCSD's slump started with a 9-
2 loss to Eastern Connecticut Uni -
versity followed by 2- 1 losses to 
Buena Vista College, Iowa and SL 
Olaf College, Minn. 

A 1-0 win against Luther started 
the comeback, followed by an 11 - 1 
thrashing of MIT, a 4-3 win over 

Calvin College. Mich., a 2-0 victo-
ry over Western Connecticut Uni -
versity and 9-1 drubbing of Man-
chester College. N.H. 

UCSD's slow start could have 
been due to many things. 
Maybe it was jet lag , or 
nerves or ~Iuggishness as a 
rcsulr of a helli sh tinul$ " 
week. Whatever the caus<\ 
it was "st:ary," according ' 
to Gerckens. 

Against Eastern Con-
necticut on Monday, pitch- . 
er Erin Flanigan gave up S 

runs in the second inning. and the " 
Tritons made 8 errors in an ugly. 9-
2 loss. 

Later that day, UCSD regained 
some of its composurc as Allison 
Jacobs allowed only 2 runs to a 
dynamilc Buena Vista team. The 
Tritons could score only I run on 
the Beavers as they dropped their 
second in a row, 2- 1. 

The low point of the break came 
on Tuesday against St. Olaf. 
Jacobs again allowed only 2 runs. 
and the Tritons again failed to scon: 
more. The slumping Tritons could 
manage only 2 hits against a much 
weaker St. Olaf pitching squad. 

The loss to the much less -tal -
ented opponent was a wake·up call 
for UCSD. The squad had come 
3,000 miles to play. but it was los-
ing to teams it shouldn't lose to. 
The next game would be crucial for 
the Tritons' contidence to prove to 
themselves they could win the 
close game. 

They proved it as Flanigan 
returned to her old self in a master· 
ful pitching performance against 
LUlher College, Iowa. 

She allowed only 3 hits over 
seven innings, and when leftlielder 
Kelsey Bennell singled in Alejan-
dra SOlelo in the bottom of the sev-
enth, UCSD had its first win in 
Florida. This game was a battle,

and for the Tritons to emerge vidO-
rious was a sign of good things to 
come. 

"After three tough losses, we 
could have died, but we didn 't," 
Gerckens said. "All of games were 
low scoring. and we knew the way 
to win was good defense and con-
sistent pitching." 

The game against Luther 
showed that the Trilons' defense 
and pitching were solid. Now all 
they needed was some offense. 

Wednesday would be a day off 
for the team, and riding high on 
their tirst win, The Trilons 
regrouped and showed up Thursday 
looking like a new team. 

In the first game of the day, 
UCSD's softball sluggers took their 

hilling frustration out on MIT. Cen-
ter liclder Cynthia Sam broku out 
with 2 hits and 2 runs scored. while 
first baseman Michelle Wilson had 
a monster game wilh 2 hilS, 2 runs 
scored and 4 RBIs. In an amazing 
effort, Jacobs had more hits than 
she allowed, going 2-for-4 and only 
giving up I hit to MIT before the 
mercy.rule was implemented in the 
tiflh. 

The 11 - 1 win gave UCSD 
momentum, and from then on no 
one could stop the mighty UCSD 
softball juggernaut. 

Calvin College went down 4-3 
in the seventh inning. with Wilson 
driving in the game-winning run. 

On Friday, Wilson continued 
her dominance as UCSD rolled 

Brendan CahiH/Guwd1W1 

over Western Connecticut. Wilson 
nailed a triple for the second 
straight game and then scored an 
insurance run in the sixth as Jacobs 
pitched a shutout. 

Jacobs also provided more 
offense, recording 2 hits to go 
along with second baseman Noelle 
Tamagni's 2 hils. 

Coming oll" their now four-game 
win streak, the Trilons capped ofT 
their week by demolishing Man-
chester, 9- I. In a statement aboui 
the depth of the UCSD squad, 
everyone on the team contributed at 
least I hit. 

"I believe if we play the way we 
know how 10, staying mentally 
lough, we can win the remainder of 
our games," she said.

Mahktar Ndiaye 
Ruins the Tourney 

I would like to take this 
opportunity to personally thank 
the Uni versi ty of North Caroli -
na's Mahktar Ndiaye for ruining 
this year's NCAA tournament. 

Monday night in San Anto-
nio, the co llege basketball sea-
son came to a close. The Uni -
versity of Kentucky overcame a 
10-point halftime deficit to 
defeat the Cinderella Utes from 
Utah, 78-69. 

The suhsequent crowning of 
the 'Cats hrought to a close 
what would have been one of 
the best tournaments in history, 
a tournament that in Ndiaye's 
absence would have heen 
rememhered for all the ri ght 
reasons: Richard "Rip" Hamil-
ton's buzzer-heater, Bryce 
Drew's improbahle three-point 
bomb and Utah 's regional upset 
of then defending champion 
Arizona. 

Even as I watched CBS's 
"One Shining Moment," I knew 
the usual brilliance was missing. 
Sure, I sang along, allowed "the 
shining moments" to take me on 
an emotional roller-coaster ride, 
but it just wasn 't the same. The 
1998 NCAA Division I tourna-
ment had been ruined two hours 
before Monday 's tip-off by a 
player who was in Chapel Hill, 
not San Antonio. 

Mahktar Ndiaye took the 
sparkle out of the Final Four 
Saturday night, following the 
Tar Heels 6-point , semifinal 
loss. Ndiaye accused Utah 's 
Britton Johnsen of calling him 
the "N-word" (i .e. the inflam-
matory remark that a white 
player, Johnsen, should not use 
in reference to a black player. 
Ndiaye). According to Ndiaye, 
Johnsen uttered the insult not 
once, but on a number of occa-
sions throughout the game. 

Johnsen immediately and 
emphatically denied Ndiaye's 
allegations, stating that he 
would "never in a million years 
use that word." Utah Coach 
Rick Maje rus backed up 
Johnsen, offering to resign if the 
charges were true. 

Which brings us to Monday 
afternoon, 40 hours after Ndi -
aye's initial allegations, mere 
hours before the tip of college 
haskethall' s championship 
ga me. In a statement made 
availahle to the press, Ndiaye 
admitted that , in fact, Johnsen 
"did not use the 'N-word ' to 
him." 

As ex planation for hi s inex-
plicable accusations, Ndiaye 
stated that he was "very upset 
after the loss on Saturday." Fur-
thermore, he admitted that he 
said "some things Ihe] should 
not have said," an understate-
ment at the very least.

TRITONS LUG BANANA SLUGS 
DEDICATION: While many were spring breaking, the Tritons were smashing Slugs on the courts 
By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Writer 

While everyone was frolicking around the 
beaches of San Diego or Mexico during spring 
break, the UCSD women's tennis team was 
busy - busy mixing it up with the 

The Tritons dropped the contest against 
Division I Charleston last Thursday only to 
come back strong to defeat St. Olaf Friday 
afternoon, 8-1. UCSD built on its momentum

same score, 8- 1, and improved its sea-
son mark to 8-4.

Becky Jones took care of business at the No. 2 
slot, crushing the team of Rogers and Lai, 8-1.

over Fornum and Miller. 

likes of Division I Charleston Southern 
University (S .c.), St. Olaf College 
(Minn.) and UC Santa Cruz. 

All of these squads, with the excep-
tion of the Banana Slugs from up the 
coast, came out to Southern California 
in hopes of catching some rays and 
playing a little tennis along the way. 

The Slugs figured to be good com-
petition for the young Tritons, but they 
seemed lost with the loss ofihree of last 
year's seniors. Head Coach Liz 
LaPlante's squad saw the weakness and 
went for the jugular. 

"Lindsay has been playing well since Jen-
nifer Drimmer got hurt ," LaPlante said . 
"[Drimmer] was playing well before her ankle 
injury and she's ready to play, but we don't 
want to rush her. [Witmer] has been fantastic. 
She could always hit the ball well , but it was 
just a matter of getting more consistent and 
playing with contidence." "Fortunately for us, three seniors 

From the Tritons' standpoint, these 
matches served as a transition taking them from 
winter quarter and the beginning of the season 
to spring quarter and into the climax of the sea-
son - culminating in the NCAA Division III 
National Championships in Virginia in five 
weeks. 

graduated, and we dominated," 
LaPlante said. " It was an important win for us 
because UCSC is in our region, and we might 
face them at Nationals." 

Starting with doubles action, Kirsten Olsen 
and Maria Nguyen teamed up at the No. I slot 
and handily defeated the tandem of Brogan and 

After the doubles sweep, LaPlante handed 
the reigns to her singles players, and they did 
not di sappoint. Playing her usual dominating 
game, Nguyen upped her individual 1998 sin-
gles record to 10-2 with a 6-3, 6-3 win at the 
No.2 slot.

Spring Quarter Brings New Streak 
ASPIRATIONS: The Tritons had a tough break, but the new quarter has brought a new, sunny attitude 
By John Maynard 
Staff Writer 

While the rest of you UCSD-
ites were acting 'candalously and 
blowing wads of cash over the 
break, the UCSD baseball 
team spent its spring break 
on the diamond. 

With the way things 
went for the Tritons, the 
UCSD hardballers would 
have been more than 
happy to join you. 

The boys from La Jolla 
had a rough road over the 
break. Although the Tritons showed 
flashes of the solid baseball that 
has Triton fans exci ted over the 
prospects of what this team could 
do, UCSD could never quite put it 

all together and suffered five con-
secutive losses. 

Fortunately, with the start of the 
new quarter, the Tritons opened a 
new chapter to their season, mark-

ing their lirst win in five 
games : an impressive, 
come-frol11 -behind 11 -8 
victory over laremont 
College. 

On the weekend before 
final s, UCSD took part in 
the California Classic 
Tournament, a very impor-
tant tournament in Divi-

sion III play. 
Unfortunately, the Tritons came 

up short , dropping all four games 
they played. 

"We don' t make any excuses, 

but playing four games in two days 
on the weekend before final s was 
definitely a factor for us in the tour-
nament:' Head Coach Dan 0 ' Brien 
said. 

U SD tri ed to get its head 
above water and end its four-game 
struggle as it hosted Point Loma 
Nazarene on March 23. However, 
the match left the Tritons gaspi ng 
for air as they dropped their fifth 
game in a row, 14-7. 

UCS D got off to a good start in 
the bottom of the first, scoring 2 
run on 2 RBis from outfielder Jon 
Goldsmith and third baseman Ryan 
Hill , respectively. 

Other highlights for U SD 
came in the fifth inning. when the 
Tritons brought four men across the 

plate. Team captai n Mark Mason, 
second baseman Kenny Fluharty 
and designated hitter Eli Reichline 
each had RBis. 

Other than another run in the 
eighth on an RBI from left fielder 
George Escanuelas, the Tritons did-
n't have a whole lot to be happy 
about. 

The Triton pitching staff strug-
gled. Starter Dav id Takehara gave 
up 8 runs through four-and-a-third 
innings. Sophomore slinger 
Ye hayah Goldfarb also had a low 
day at the mound, relinquishing 3 
run ' in his one-and-a-third innings. 

UCSD used six different arm , 
giving up a total of 14 runs on 15 
hits, dropping the Tritons to 7-13

Tupac, Notorious BIG. to Headline Sun God Concert 
By Bonah J. Weedman 
Original Gangsta 

Rap artists Tupac Shakur and the Notorious 
B.I.G . have been slated as the headliners of the 
199X Sun God Festival, A.S. Programmer 
Kathy Lee announced last Friday. 

Sun God marks the first public appearance 
for Shakur and the Notorious F.A.T. si nce 
widespread reports of their untimely deaths 
due to drive-by killings . 

According to MTY representative 
Haywood Jablome, the rappers were feigning 
t heir own deaths as pari of a puhlicit y stunt to 
rak l! in ratings comparahle with those or the 
Super Bowl, the final episode of "Seinfeld" 
and the 0.1. Simpson trial. 

"Tupac and Biggie have been soaking in 
the sun on an uncharted island in the Pacific," 
Jablowme said . " It has heen MTY 's intention 
to broadcast their comehack concert from our 
studios in New York thi s July, hut CSD's 
programming office outhid us." 

The A.S. programming offi ce has report -
edly offered a sum or $3 million dollars for 
each rapper to appear. According to Lee, the 
money allocated ror the rappers' concert 

appea rances was morc than U SO was wi 11 -
ing to pay. 

"Wc were onl y given a $40,000 hudget to 
work with ," Lel! said . "But when the opportu-
nity was presented to us by Tupac and the 
Notorious P.I.G.'s people, we couldn ' t resist. " 

With the help of A.S. vice president of 
finance and UCSD resident Mack 0 ' th.: Year 
Tony "Puffy" Fiori, program ming's funding 
for artist appearances at Sun God was greatly 
increased hy re-allocating Ch<.lI1 l.:e llor Rohert 
Dynes' retirement fund . 

Sean "purl' Daddy" Comhs has expressed 
an interest in recording the event, and then 
releasi ng it as hi s own "ori gi nal" work. 

According tn hi ~ agent, Shloll1o 
Rahinowitz, the otoriou~ R.I.P. is exci ted to 
perform at Sun God. 

"Biggie is ecstati l.: , and so am I," 
Rahinowitz said. "He told me personally that 
he missed the spotlight , and that life ain ' t all 
chillin ' on a beach, si ppin ' on a 40 afld 
pimpin ' Ily bitches and ho 's." 

Shakur, in a phune intervi ew, si mply 
added, "West-siiiiiide."

tory, wa~ prompted hy thl! recent and puhlic 
dehates over changing the name of the 
Women's Studies program and major. 

Hugh Hefner, the rounder and owner of 
Playboy magazine, visited the UCSD campus 
on Friday to personally make the ofrer in a 
speech he gave from atop the Sun God statue. 
Hl! was forced to pl!rch in thi s precarious posi-
tion due to all the squea ling young girls who 
mohhed him in hopes of heing discovered. 

"It is my pleasure to se lect UCSO as 
Playhlly's uni vers ity of choice," Hefner said . " I 
honestly helieve that the eternal sun , sand and 
heach here in La Jolla ha ve contrihuted to the 
ex traordinary heauty of U SO women ; we 
would like to honor these women hy reshaping 
a program al l ahout them." 

Along with the change in name, PllIyhoy has 
also required the addition of certain new class-
es into the Babes, Bodies and Sex Studies cur-
riculum. The classes include "Overcoming the 
Emharrassment of Posing ude," "The 
Significance of Bunnies" and " 101 Uses for 
Satin Sheets." 

Many ~tudent s are thrilled hy thi s nl!W 
opportunity that has heen presented to them. 

" I just can' t believe Hugh Hefner came to 
SO. It is my ultimate dream in life to he a 

Playboy playmate just like Jenny McCarthy 
and Pamela Anderson," Revelle junior andy 
Brandy said. "And, I think these new classes 
should be added to al l the colleges' general ed 
requirements - we chicks never know when 
posing in the buff may come in handy."

Greeks Take Over Geisel, Con.vert to Giant Frat ~ouse 
COUP: Fraternitie 
demand that UCSD 
grant 'Party Right' 
By Diana 
Greek Goddess 

In a random tum of events ye~ter­
day, Greek organiLations mounted a 
hOl>tilc takeover or eisel Library to 
counter UCSD' supposed apathy 
toward fraternities and sororities by 
non-Greek students. 

Hundreds of students marching 

to the musical theme from "Ferris 
Bueller's Day OtT' stormed Gei~el 
Lihrary to demonstrate their fru ~­
tration. Witnesses reported hea ring 
leaders shouting, "We' ve had it 
with all this damn studying, and 
we're not going 10 take it anymore!

Their demand seemed linked to

Pi~ tures and Steve n Spielberg 
hring audiences the story of' the 
sinking of the most beloved ship 
ever, the 5.5. Minnow, in the new 
release, " Minnow." opening tomor-
row in theaters nationwide. 

With enhanced spedal effects, 
an all -star cast and a ncar full -scale 
model of the Mill/lOW serving as a 
sct, " Minnow" has all the makings 
to be the most successful film ever. 

Two sailors, Gilligan and Ihe 
Skipper (played by Keanu Reeves 
and Wayne Newton, respectively) 
arc the crew of the 5.5. Minllow, a 
tourist ship making its maiden voy-
age out of San Diego Hamor. Along 
lor the trip arc five passengers, eager 
to make the three-hour tour. But a 
giant stonn takes the ship oil-course 
and into peri lous danger. 

Gilligan and the Skipper arc 
able to save the ship and, despite a 
gaping hole in the side of the ooat , 
arc ahle to land it on a small , 
um;harted island somewhere off' the 
coast of Fiji . 

The rest of the lilm is the story 
of the stranded castaways and thcir 
efforts 10 find a way olT Ihe island.

• LEARN HOW TO USE AND/OR MISUSE 

STATISTICS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE 
Standard topics of statistics and probability are presented in a novel and 
visual way using computer animated images. In this course, on hand 
experimentation with graphica l software replaces complex mathematical 
language as m eans of communicating the subject matter. There is no 
computer literacy requirement. Our first week of instruction will be at 
a computer lab where you will learn how to use the software needed for 
this course. We start learning , by computer simulation , standard topics 
of probability theory which lie at the foundations of statistics, such as: 

• dependence, independence, conditional probabilities, 
expectation and variance 

a normal, exponential, Poisson distributions 
• law of large numbers and the central limit theorem

deranged genius who can build any 
device out of coconut shells, palm 
leaves and bamboo, but can ' t seem 
to fix a hole in a fucking boat. 

Noteworthy performances are 
turned in hy Leslie Nielsen and Elle 
MacPherson as Mr. And Mrs. 
Howell , the multi-millionaire couple. 
So rich, in fact, arc the Howells, that 
audiem;es wili wonder why Ihe hell 

.Ihey have all Ihose clolhes if they 
were only going nn a three-hour lour. 

But the highlight of' Ihe movic 
is, withoul a douh!. the torrid love 
affair hetween heart -throbs Ginger 
and Maryanne (Ellen DeGeneres 
and Anne Heche). 

Pay special attcnti on to the 
hlood-th irsty cannihals thai a!lack 

the island. II' you look close ly, 
you' ll be able to see Christian 
Slater and Robert Downey, Jr. , 
making cameo appearances. 

As a speci al treat for audiences, 
an extra cameo is made by Dom 
DeLuise, who plays the sexy surfer 
who rides that one wave lor way 
too long, landing on the island. 

Wilh brilliant sets consisting of 
a fake lagoon, a crappy-lo<Jking 
fiberglass cave and a multitude of 
plasti c palm trees, audiences will 
swear they, 100, are stranded on the 
island. Complementing the movie 
is Vanilla ke's hit si ngle, "Help, 
Ihe DlImn Boa t is Sinking (Buy-
eee!)" Look for " Minnow" to cash
