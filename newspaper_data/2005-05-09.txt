Nurses, university agree to 
extension in contrad talks 

By JACLYN SNOW 
Contributing writer 

The University of California 
and the union representing nurses 
at its five medical centers agreed 
late last month on a three-week 
extension to ongoing contract 
negotiations after the taJks failed 
to cement an agreement. 

"We had some issues we could 
not resolve by April 30, so we 
mutually agreed to extend the time 
to work on these issues thorough-
ly," UC Office of the President 
labor- relations spokesman Noel 
Van Nyhuis said. 

The California Nurses 
Association, a union represent-
ing 9,000 registered nurses at UC 
hospitals, said that disagreements 
over recruittnent and retention 
policies have srbod in the way of 
a deal. 

"The big issue with UCSD is it 
has the lowest pay in the county," 
said Beth Kean, who oversees the 
UC nurses' division for the union. 
"UCSD nurses get paid $7 to 
$8 per hour below Kaiser. There 
is a relative nurse shortage here. 
Nurses just out of school go to 
[UCSD) for a few years and then 
leave to go to other hospitals that 
pay more to help compensate for 
the skyrocketing house market in 
San Diego." 

A bargaining alert sent out by 
the union stated that UCSD's 
pay rate is 6 percent below mar-
ket wages. According to CNA, 
this does not allow UCSD to 
compete with compara ble local 
hospitals. 

"There is a 65-percent turn-
over rate each year - phenom-

Travis Ball/Guardian 
ContrKt dea.y: Thornton Hospital radiology nurse Gail Dulaney and organized 
nurses at UC hospitals have failed to reach an agreement on a new contract 
enally high - and with such a 
high turnover it puts a lot of 
stress on older nurses who have to 
train these new nurses all the time 
and sti ll watch over the very sick 

patients," Kean said.

the university was not available

Lawmakers may up 
private school grants 
Governor proposing cuts in 
private school Cal Grants 
By CHARLES NGUYEN 

Senior Staff Writer 

T he California Assembly's most 
powerful committee, which reviews 
spending for state programs, is 
considering legi lation that would 
raise maximum Cal Grant aid to 
students at private universi ties and 
Cal Grant B recipients. 

The bill , introduced by 
A~semblywoman Carol Liu (D-La 
Canada Flintridge), would counter 
waning financial aid provided to 
private university students, accord-
ing to Bruce Hamlett, chief con-
sultant to the Assembly Higher 
Education Subcommittee who pre-
pared an analysis of the proposal 
for lawmakers. 

"Currently, whatever is put in 
the budget is given to private uni-
versity students," he said. "This 
policy didn't work anymore when 
[the) economy was slashed, and -
in tum - the budget was slashed. 
The maximum award to each stu-
dent was cut by about $2,500 in the 
past year, and now students have to 
take on more loans to pay for their 
education. " 

Liu's legislation, AB 358, pro-
poses a formula that would link the 
private university award maximum 
to the weighted average of Cal 
Grants allocated by the state to 
support CSU and UC students, 
according to California Student 
Aid Commission spokeswoman 
Carole Durante. 

The bill 's formula would 

increase the maximum pri ate 
univer ity Cal Grant next year 
to $10,568, as opposed to Gov. 

rnold chwarzenegger's pro-
posed 10-percent reduction to 
$7,449. The increase would pull 
an extra $19 million from the 
state general fund in the 2005-06 
budget to pay for the hi gher pri-
vate awards. 

While Schwarzenegger has 
not taken a stance on the bill , he 
stands by his previous cuts to Cal 
Grant recipients who attend pri-
vate universities, according to state 
Department of Finance spokesman 
H.D. Palmer. 

"The rationale was to achieve a 
pact with the UC and CSU presi-
dents that we would continue in 
aiding their students at the level 
we always have," Palmer said. "At 
the time, providing equal funding 
for private universities would have 
had an effect on public university 
students." 

The Department of Finance 
would not comment on whether 
the California budget could accom-
modate the costs if the bill was 
passed. 

Additionally, Liu's legislation 
seeks to target first-year sUldents 
at all community colleges and 
universities through Cal Grant B, 
which provides living allowance 
and tuition and fee assistance for 
low-income students. J f passed, the 
bill would eliminate a Cal Grant

Women faculty pay 
still lagged last year 

Budget deal to boost Pell Grants 
By MADELINE PHILLIPS 

Staff Writer 

Doctoral univer ities employ half 
as many tenured women as men, and 
these female faculty earn about 20 
percent less, on average, than their 
male counterparts, according to the 
American Association of niversity 
Professors' annual report on faculty 
pay. 

Titled "Inequities Persist for 
Women and Non-Tenure-Track 
Faculty," the report also found that 
full-time faculty who are not in a 
position to receive tenure earn 26 
percent less, and part-time instruc-
tors earn 64 percent below the sa la-
ries of full -time faculty. Inequalities 
arc also apparent between the sa la-
ries of faculty and the top execu-
tives that run universities, as some 
presidents make nearly even times 
th amount of enior profes ors, 
the AAUP reported . 

"Not only is there a disparity 
between executive and faculty sala-
ries, but it is getting wider," said 
UCSD Academic Senate Chair 
Donald Tuzin, who did not contrib-
ute to the compilation of the report. 

AAUP has frequently noted the 
gender inequitie in past reports. 
However, the non-tenure-track 
faculty inequities represent a new 
finding this year. The report also 
showed that, although the rate of 
inflation this year was 3.3 percent, 
the average salary increased by only 
2.8 percent, making this the first 
time in eight years that inflation-
adjusted salaries have decreased . 

The organization itself made 
few specific recommendations to 
remedy the issues rai ·ed in its data . 
Its findings were in tead meant 
a a starting point to encourage 
further dialogue, according to the

Late last month, Congress 
passed a controversial 2006 federal 
budget framework, offering mixed 
funding levels for higher educa-
tion and student financial aid 
programs. With no Democrat vot-
ing in favor of the joint resolution, 
the budget proposal was passed in 
back-to-back votes of 214 to 2 II 
in the House of Representatives 
and 52 to 47 in the enate. 

The congressional budget 
wi ll eliminate the multibil -
lion-dollar shortfall in the Pell 
Grant program that has held th e 
level of student aid stagnant in 
recent yea rs and will fund a 100 
increase in the maximum grant 
award in each of the next five 
years, a plan backed by President 
Geurge W Bush. 

"The budget reflects an 
increase in Pell rants of 1.3 
billion or 10. l percent over 2005 
/levels] and 41 7 million in new 

budget authority . .. to increase 
the maximum grant by $100 
to $4,150, begin ing in 2006," 
Senate Budget Committee Chair 
Sen. Judd regg (R-N.H.) stated 
in a press rele'lse. "The number 
of recipients would increase by 
138,000 over 2005, an increase 
of 2.6 percent. Since 2001, Pell 
Grant spending has increased by 
$4.9 billion, or 56 percent. " 

Though the resolutio n frees 

additional funtls to be used for 
th e Pell Grant program, 'pecial 
subcommittees in the II ()u~e and 
Senate must approve the. incrca,e 
before it ca n take effect. 

The resolution also rolls hack 
some of the cuts proposed by 
Bush. Most not,lbly, the resolu-
tion did not include the pre,idcnt's 
recommendation to eliminate the

Nurses: Sides remain at 
odds over staffing levels 

concinued from page I 
to respond, both sides had previ-
olls ly agreed to keep toe actual 
wage proposals under discussion 
private until a deal was reached. 

In addition to wages, the two 
sides have remained at odds over 
many poi nts of discontent, includ-
ing benefits, staffing ratios, pen-
sion and recruitment of nurses 
frol11 nursing agencies. T he union 
h,lS argued that using temporary 
employment agencies to bring in 
out-of-state nurses represen ts a 
uao use of funds . In such situa-
tions. the university has to pay 
for travel and housing and a fee to 
the agency, in addition to paying 
tem porary nurses much higher 
\\'ages than average. 

The university maintains that 
its staffing levels arc adequate 
and in compliance with applicable 
state law. 

Bo th sides have also disagreed 
over the $2.4 mi ll ion in per for-
mance incentives paid to top 
executives at the medical cen ters 
earlier this year. 

"Nurses are very angry about 
that," Kean said. "[The university 
doesn't] want to put money in 
the medical cente rs that make the 
medical centers run , but are will -
ing to give huge bonuses to the 
executives. " 

However, the university said 
that the money was not awarded 
in the form of bonuses, but as a 
way to make sure the e~ecutives 
are doing their jobs. 

"Our medical center execu-
tives did nor get a bonus, like 
CNA tr ies to portray." Van 

yhuis said. "T hey received com-
pensation in two forms: base pay 
and tllen incenrives when they 
meet their performance goals. It 
is something consistent with the 
industry standards and it actually 
lags be hind com parable hospi tals 
across the coun try." 

W hile there has been no deci-
sion to str ike. the option has not 
been ru led out. 

"In ou r h istory of bargain-
ing, we have always come to an 
agreement," Van Nyhuis said. 
"We are very hopeful that wh en 
we go back to the bargaining 
tables on May 16. we will be 
able to negot iate a fair dea l fo r 
our nurses." 

H owever, Kea n said union 
members are taking the possibil -
ity of a work stoppage seriously 
in light of the one-day strike by 
UC service workers that led to a 
new contrac t agreement with the 
university. 

"H onestly, nurses are talking 
about striking." Kean said . "They 
watched the service workers strike 
and saw how successful that was. 
T he UC is used to havi ng contro l 
and not listening to its workers. 
like the I1llrses." 

In 2002, ta lks between the 
union and the university stalled 
over simil ar problems that pre-
vented a deal on a new contract. 
The nurses voted to strike, but 
shortly after the vote, negotia-
tions resumed and the two parties 
reached an agreement.

I ETCETERA .tt 

I BRIEFLY 
Study: Many dropouts 

saddled with debt 
More than two of every five col-

lege freshmen who borrow money 
to pay for their education drop out 
before gradu~ti ng with a degree, leav-
Ing them facmg thousands of dollars 
in debt and few high-demand skills to 
eam the money to pay it off, a new 
study from the National Center for 
Public Policy and Higher Education 
reports. 

Examining the most recent data ' 
from 1995 to 2ct1 maintained by 
the U.s. Department of Education, the 
May study concludes that half of all 
entering freshmen took out loans to 
pay for college and that 20 percent of 
the borrowers dropped out. The num-
ber of borrowers was even higher at 
community colleges and private insti-
tutions, leaving more than 350,000 
former students with no degree or 
certificate facing a mountain of debt 

These students are twice as likely 
to be unemployed as those who 
graduate and more than 10 times as 

~Kely to default on their loans. 
"They had, in effect, the worst of 

both worlds: They did .not benefit 
from the higher income associated 
with education beyond hi~ school, 
and they accumulated signincant edu-
cational deb~" Joni E. Finney. the 
center's vice president stated in the 
report's foreword . 

However. the study concluded 
that taking out loans did not make 
students more likely to drop out 
before graduating. pointing instead 
to factors like academic preparation 
and socioeconomic status as better 
predictors of college completion. 

Americans support 
student steroid tests 
Almost 90 percent of the AmeriCiln 

public said they supported random test-
ing hiltl school athletes for steroid use. 
accoraing to a poll performed by the 
Sacred Heart University Polling Institute. 

Overa ll, 67 percent said they 
'strongly supported" and another 20 
percent said they "somewhat sup-
ported" random tests. Only 9 percent 
said they were in opposition. 

'We have a culture of youths today 
that's more sophisticated in a negative 
way - they don 't think of the conse-
quences but only the shortest distance 
to fame," SHU Director of Intercollegiate 
Athletics Don Cook stated in a press 
release. HUnfortunate~, they sometimes 
think steroid use is the best w~ to 
get there. The benefit of testing high 
school athletes is that they'll leam not 
to use steroids at 16 and 17, rather 
than later - and colleges in tum will 

inherit clean students who are less apt 
to use drugs:' 

Earlier this month, top officia ls 
at the Californ ia Interscholastic 
Federation approved new regulations 
In an attempt to restrict steroid use. 
Under new rules that take effect next 
fall, each of the state's high school 
athletes and his or her parents will 
need to sign a form promising that 
athletes wilf not use steroids. 

State lawmakers are considering a 
bill that would impose mandatory ran-
dom testing for high school students. 

Student opinion split 
on video games 

World of Warcraft took the title of 
·Favorite Video Game" with only 1 1 
percent of the vote, beating out Halo 
2 by less than 1 percent In the first 
national survey on video game use by 
the Art Institute system of schools. 

The private unIVerSity system polled 
1,000 students enrolled in its Art and 
Design and its Animation and Visual 
and G~me Programming departments, 
attending one of 31 campuses across 
the country. Many of these students 
plan to work in the $3o-billion-per-year 
software entertainment industry. 

Yeast could help 
genome mapping 

UCSD researchers have invented 
a new technique to organize genetic 
infolfllation stored in yeast cnromo-
somes, allOlrVing them to map the fun-
gus' genome on a wiring diagram that 
rooks like an electronic circuit board. 

A similar diagram for humans, 
when developed, will likely help in 
the discovery of genetic diseases, 
they predicted. 

In a May study, the researchers 
said they could use the position of the 
genes on the diagram to predict the 
functions of the 343 yeast proteins. 

Yeast has been a traditional favor-
ite for study by geneticists because 
it grows rapidly. Scientists have also 
found sim~laritles among genes of 
other species In the same domain 
with the fungus, including humans.

. AAUP: UC making efforts 
to close gap between genders 

continued from page I 
repon 's au thor, MUP Director 
of Research John C urtis. 

"We're more in terested in just 
srimulating and revitalizing the 
discussion and bringing some 
new data to the table," he sa id. 

T he statistics on gender ineq-
uiti es have revealed differences 
between men and women's sal a-
ries in several areas of highe r 
education . For exampl e. since 
at least the 1970s, only about 
47 percent of full -time women 
professors have had tenure - a 
type of employment that makes 
a teaching position permanent. 
wi thout the need for regular con-
tract renewals - compared to 70 
percen t of men. 

C ur tis sa id he believes many 
universi ties have failed to ade-
quately combat the pay issues. 
though his organization has con-
sistently revealed them eve.ry year. 

"My sense was that there were 
a lot ofinsrirutions that just added 
a few women to thei r facul ty and 
thought that solved the problem, 
but I really do n't think it did ," 
he said. 

The U niversity of C alifornia 
has also shown a concern over 
sa lary inequities in recent years. 
In 2002, UCSD issued a Gender 
Equi ty Task Force Report that 
examined dispariti es between 
salar ies, rates of employment and 
promotions of men and women . 
The report found that women 
represented only 18 percent of 
the permanent or ladder-rank 
faculty, particularly in the sci-
ences. where a higher percentage 
of female candidates were avail-
able than were hired. 

However, these disparities may 
be accounted for by the fact that 
higher education instirutions, like 

the un iversity, usually only h ire 
scholars with postdoctoral experi-
ence, UC Provost and Senior Vice 
President of Academic Affai rs 
M .R.C. Greenwood stated in a 
December 2004 opinion piece in 
the San p"oncisco Chronicle. That 
applicant pool is closer in pro-
portion to the number' of women 
hired, she stated. 

The 2002 report also blamed 
UC childbearing and childcare 
policies, calling them inadequate. 
However. it found that there was 
little gender bias when it came to 
promotions and that overall. the 
campus had relatively few prob-
lems with gender imbalance. 

The UC system has made ·an 
effort to address many of these 
issues, the university announced 
in a 2003 statement. The docu-
ment stated that the rate of hir-
ing in top faculty positions for 
women jumped from 2S percent 
of new professors in 2000 to 36 
percent in 2003 , and that the 
numbers continue to increase. As 
a result, women currently com-
pose 36 percent of new faculty 
appointments, up from 12 per-
cent in 1998. 

Such data appear to prove 
that the university is making 
headway in fixing some of the 
problems discovered in the 2002 
gender-equity report. according 
[Q Tuzin . 

"This campus. I think, has 
recently and vigorously moved to 
identify and remove gender inequi-
ties," T uzin said. "I believe UCSD 
and UC generally are usually ahead 
of the wave, and we are particularly 
pleased with the outcome of the 
gender-cquity report. "

B restriction that allows no more 
than 2 percent of first-year stu-
dents to receive funds for ruition 
and fee payments. Inste ad. the leg-
islation would place this 2 -percent 
restriction on fourth-ye ar students 
beginning in 2010. 

"The limit on first-year students 
places an extra burden on them." 
Hamlett said. "More often than not, 
they can't adjust in time because of 
the sudden higher financial costs that 
come with college. M o ving the 2-

~rcem limit to fourth-year students, 
who are more established and might 
have better opportunities at finding 
other financial resources, would stop 
the stress on freshman and sopho-
more students." 

Because there are more first-
year students than fourth-year stu-
dents, Liu's proposal to increase 
Cal Grant aid to underclassmen 
ramer than older students requir es 
supplementary costs, accordin g 
to the bill's summary. While the 
e"act cost will depend on the num-
ber of eligible students in 2010, 
CSAC estimated the change would 
require 582 million if implemented 
next year. 

The bill would increase reten-
tion by "front-loading" Cal Grant 
B aid to students in their first years 
of college study. Appropriations 
Committee consultant Chuck 
Nicol stated in an analysis of the 
bill. . 

The Appropriations Committee 
is expected to act on the bill by 
May 26.

Patriot Act deserves to be nixed, not updated 
By SARAH BAN 
Contributing Writer 

T hree years since its incep-tion, the time has come to reevaluate and amend the 
USA Patriot Act, which was passed 
soon after 9/ 11 by an overwhelm-
ing margin in the House and Senate 
(357-66 in the House and 98- 1 in 
the enate). Congress is now hold -
ing hearings to determine the fa te 
of the act. 

While fostering whirlwinds of 
debate, the Patriot Act has been 
urili 7.ed by law enforcement agen-
cies since the terrorist attacks and 
has altereil several critical laws 
concerning wiretapping, computer 
fraud and criminal procedure. The 
act has been the subject of contro-
versy on nil sides of the political 
spectrum , prompting disa pproval 
from personages such as John 
Kerry, fo rmer Democratic presi-
dentia l nominee, Russ Feingold, 
the lone Democratic senator who 
voted against the act and Newt 
Gi ngrich , who stated that "we must 
ensure that the legal tools provided 
are not abused, and indeed, that 
they do not undermine the very 
foundation our country was built 
upon." 

Not only due to the written 
provisio ns but also becau e of 
what it represents, the act is a mix-
ture of both contradictory word-
ing and historical reiteration . In 
simpler terms: There is nothing 
"patri otic" about breaching the 
rights o f civilians and repeating 
a history of injustice - a hi story 
that has been conveniently for-
gotten . H opefully, Congress and 
the rest of those who hold power 
to reva mp the Pa triot Act will 
not repea t the blunder of allowing 
another period of aQusc to fl y by. 

-1'0 some, the line between 
national securi ty and violation of 
civil liberty should be tenuou and 
trans lucent. The government has 
the prerogative and moral duty 
to protect its citizens, they argvc, 
even if it means that any person 
can be a suspect without dem-
onstrating, well, suspicious behav-
ior. To others, the line should be 
rock solid and written in bold: 
Section 2 15, also known as the 
"Librarian's Nightmare," infri nges 

upon American citizens by forcing 
organizations to disclose tangible 
records of their patrons in com-
plete and utter silence. And that 
is just one single provision of the 
act (it is no coincidence or act of 
convenience that I omit the word 
"patriot" here). 

T he First Amendment is 

breached here as well . The rights 
guaranteed by this amendment are 
what distingtlish America as the 
land of freedom, touted by the 
great Statue of Liberty on our 
coast. However, under Section 
2 15, a person's mere presence at 
a religious gathering or click of 
a button on the Internet can be 

Roy Pak/Cuordian 
grounds for investigation by the 
government. 

Will checlcing out a book on 
kamikaze from Geisel make some-
one a prime suspect, or wi II par-
ticipating in a peaceful protest do 
it? Exactly how much evidence of 
this so-called suspicious behavior 
must be acquired for a person to be 

America's next big threat' 
It is this obscurity that enables 

the skeptical to draw the bold line 
between patriotism and abuse . 
There is no real ca use behind these 
provisions, which only create an 
ironic effect: to protect tile ci tizcns 
from terror, the citizens must be 
terrorized th emselves in more ways 
than one. 

The act is also counterproduc-
tive because rather than feeling pro-
tected, there is a sentiment of hav-
ing nowhere to hide. Big Brother 
may well have already paid a visit to 
everyone who has contemplated the 
act. It isn 't the first time that our 
countrymen have fe lt this way, so it 
is inevitable to bring up the repeti-
tion of history a t this point. The 
injustices of the act are remini scent 
of the injustices of Japanese intern -
ment. Another common evocation 
is Senator McCarthy. Holl ywood 
Ten, anyone? 

T hese worri es eldom arose 
prior to the establishmen t of the 
Patriot Act, when the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act pre-
vai led . Enacted in 1978 , two major 
distinctions separate FISA as an 
acceptable bill : First, oilly foreign 
powers were targeted, and second, 
the act was utilized solely when 
therc was a sufficient amount of 
justification - a "probable cause." 

What does the government 
have to say a bout this fadeout of 
our rights' Will it soon be a di ap-
pearance in total? 

U.S. Attorney General Alberto 
Gonzales stood before Congress 
at the beginning of this month 
asserting that the admi nistration 
has been and will be very prudcnt 
in its decisions coinciding with the 
act. The Justice Department seeks 
to retain portions of the Patriot 
Act that are objectionable, such as 
the aforementioned Section 215 , 
but maintains that citizens ' liberties 
will not be breached. 

Like the name "Patriot Act" 
itsel f, its claims arc also contradic-
tory to its actions. Let us examine 
a few examples provided by one 
of the organizations most actively 
opposed to the bill, the American 
Civil Liberties Union: 

According to reports, the Patriot

Considering the pros and cons of 'twixterdom' 
On those who give up the dream of party houses and return to sweet rent-free childhood 

Indecent 
Exposure 
Marianne Madden 

O n Saturday, an oddball of an article popped up on the Pacific News Service. 
Penned by a 23-year-old "twixter" 
sti ll livin g witll his parents, this 
writer - let's call him Pete Micek, 
beca use that's his name - shared 
the joys and tribula tions of living at 
home pas t age 18 and, as in his case, 
past coll ege graduation. Apparently, 
the numbers of such "twixters" are 
on the rise: T he arti cle cites a 
2003 University of M ichigan study 
that found tha t "th e proportion of 
people in thei r 20s living wi th their 
pa rents lllcreascd [by] 50 percent 
between 1970 and 1990." 

Witho ut having to read the 
article, it should be obvious what 
most of the pros and cons of 
"twixterdom" (God, I love using 
that word) are. Pro: Free rent l 

Con: Getting cock-blocked by 
your own parents. Pro: No util-
ity bills! Con: Your parents' stern 
looks at the breakJast table when 
you're hungover and have inexpli-
cably lost your pants. Pro: 100% 
disposable income l Con: Sunday 
dinners with the 'rents, the little 
sis and incontinent Aunt Georgia . 
Pro: Free rent, dude.' 

With graduation only a few 
weeks away for some of us (good 
luck, you poor souls), I bet tak-
ing your diploma and shacking up 
wi th the fo lks has crossed at least 
a few of your minds. Come on , 
admit it. The arrangement would 
only be temporary until you find 
that$200k-a-year fob with benefits, 
your own secretary and a private 
jet, right? And speaking for myself, 
because my opinion is the only one 
that matters, Micek's article made 
living with one's parents come close 
to actually being appealing. 

Almost. "Hey guys, I just 
scored some free rent!" doesn't 
have the same ring to it as "Hey 
guys, I just scored with that hot-
tie from the bar '" And I'm not 

sure my parents would even let 
me move bade in; judging by that 
huge party they threw when I went 
off to college they're glad to have 
me tucked neatly away, 500 miles 
from home. 

Twixterdom at least has that 
element of predictability: You 
know your parents and their quirks, 
instead of moving in with best 
friends who, as soon as Move-In 
Day arrives, morph into monsters 
who eat your cereal, forget to pay 
bills on time, break your favorite 
Star Wars toy and othe.rwise make 
your life a living hell . 

But look at us - we're only 
too eager to skip into the wild blue 
yonder of living with people we 
naively assume will become our 
best friends . Girls dream of paint-
ing each others' toenails during 
Tom Cruise movie maratllOns, bor-
rowing each other 's clothes and 
being each other 's tearful, giggling 
maids of honor. Guys dream of 
- well , I'm not sure what guys 
dream of, but it probably involves 
a roommate with a cool gaming 
system, a ton of DVDs and a lot of 

hot female friends. 
These scenarios rarely occur in 

real life, but their siren call is obvi-
ous whenever yet another idealistic 
student hopefully sign a new lease 
for "the coolest house/apartment! 
condo ever!" We'll take three years 
living with Miss Hellspawn if we 
can someday enjoy a month living 
with Mr. Awesome with his plasma 
TV, knack for malcing the best 
steak in the world and personal 
connections to Chris Rock. Or 
we'll overlook a place's shortcom-
ings because of its prime location 
- "Hey, buddy' This place doesn't 
have running water, but it's near 
the beach l" Or we'll gladly jump 
through the landlord's hoops to 
score the "perfect" housing - "a 
$10,000 deposit, no parking and no 
electricity after 9 pm? Sign me up! 
But only if you knock 20% off my 
first month's rent - what an awe-
some deal!" 

Who knows what will happen 
to us when we graduate and those 
handy checks from mom and pop 
are suddenly replaced with admo-
nitions to get a job' (personally, I 

plan on marrying rich so I never 
have to worry about money. I've 
already set the date for the wed-
ding: June 18, 2006, the Sunday 
after my graduation. You're all 
invited, especially if you want to be 
the groom.) 

It doesn't help that UCSD is 
governed by the ethos that if you 
don't land a job as an engineer 
the minute you finish your degree, 
you're going to die alone and broke. 
No one will ever love you, and you 
will slowly waste away on a diet of 
Ramen noodles, booze and tears. 
Your parents will disown you, and 
America will cast your worthless, 
soulless shell into the ocean to be 
eaten by fish that lead more mean-
ingful lives than yours. 

Or. I suppose you can elllbrace 
twixterdom and move back into 
your parents' hou e. I'm sure they 
wouldn't mind. You can handle a 
few more years of family dinners 
and no love life, right?

Act has bee n used to secretly sea rch 
the home of Brandon Mayfield, a 
Muslim attorney whom the govern-

and detained as a perpetrator of the 
recent train bombing in Madrid . 

It has also been used to charge.

for providing "material support" 
to terrorists by posting links to 
objectionable materials on a Web 
site, even though such links were 
available on the Web sites of a 
major news outlet and of the gov-

the case. 

In addition, it has been used to 
serve a National Security Letter 
on an Internet service provider so 
coercive under the provisions of 
the NSL statue that a federal court 
struck down the entire stanlte -
as vastly expanded by the Patriot 
Act - used to obtai n information

not to mention gag that ISP fro m

ing this abuse to the public when 
the ACLU became awa re of it and 
from disclosing important circum-
stances rel ati ng to this abuse and 
other possible abuses of the gag, 
even to this vety day. 

If the public backlash cannot 
convey to the federal government

With a stri ke 
and a pending contract 
on their checklist, 
UCSD service workers 
wonder what lies ahead. 

By CHRlmNE ME 
Associate Features Editor 

W hile eating fruit salad during hiS. lunch break at OceanView l e rrace, Carlos Cerecero voiced his concerns aloud. "How can we make change if J have no power? If the people 
in the union calmot make changes, how can P Give us ideas. Give us 
power." 

Cereccro is onc of many UCSD service workers who ask the same 
question. Sixty years old, having worked a a cook at OVT for the past 
two years, Cerecero immigrated to the U nited States from Mexico 4{) 
years ago and wonders about the efficdCY of labor unions tha t UC service 
workers have grown to rely on for representation. 

Earning $8 an hour, crccero chose to work for Housing and Dining 
Services instead of taking a job at a taco stand, which can pay $12 an hour, 
in order to receive medical benefits from the university. 

"That's why I am here," Cerecero said . "It's for thc benefits, not the 
sa lary." 

As part of the lowest-paid group of university employees, food-service 
workers like Cerecero are joining other service work employees in an 
effort to receive higher wages. 

A mess is something rarely seen among the lecture halls, restrooms 
and sidewalks of UCSD 's large, six-college campus. Instead of trash , the 
things students usually see strewn along L ibrary Walk are leaves that fall 
from the surrounding anny of eucalyptus trees, or student organization 
fl yers pasted on the ground with blue tape. Bathrooms are routinely 
stocked with paper towels, and the wastebaskets at C LICS are si lently 
emptied throughout the evening. 

For students living on campus, bathrooms are cleaned at least once a 
week, whi le students living off campus wish they could have such luxury 
again. 

T he people responsible for the maintenance of the university are the 
service workers of Physical Plant and Housing and Dining Services, and 
such service does not come for free. But in light of last month's union 
activity, the issue of higher pay has been put into question. 

After months of bargaining with the university over what consti tutes 
a living wage, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees Local 3299 and a team of service workers across the University 
of California pushed the issue with a one-day strike on April 14. 

'Tfhe strike) brought workers a little more together, more close," 
sa id Richard Lawrence, ~n organizer for AFSCME 3299 and a UCSD 
central garage employee. "It unified them. It made us a lot stronger, and 
we found out we could accomplish things." 

Though it is absent in the recently proposed contract between the 
union and the university, the shining goal of AFSCME 3299 is to estab-
lish a "step system" that guarantees a gradual salary increase over the 
course of a worker's duration of employment. Under current negotia-
tions, this "chance to advance," as the union caUs it, has not been offered 
by the university. 

Lawrence and Jessica Lopez, a UCSD alunma and organizer of 
AFSCME 3299, both central figures during the strike, have fought for 
the interests of UC service workers. The step-system is at the top of tlleir 
plans to improve fairness to UCSD's service workers who are working 
under a merit-based system that tends toward favoriti sm, according to 
Lopez. 

"We wanted to implement a new step system that is not based on 
merit," Lopez said. "Now we're here to try something in its place." 

Last April's strike was followed by a pending agreement berween the 
union and the university that includes a minimum wage of$9 by this fall 
and one free meal per day for food-service workers, among other benefits. 
But what many workers truly hoped to see changed was the university'S 
system of employee promotion. 

Miguel Macedo has worked for UCSD 's Physical Plant Services for 
18 yea rs and is hoping for higher pay after working for the paint shop 
- a branch of several PPS skilled worker jobs - for four years without a 
promotion. Irma Sanchez worked as a custodi an and also switched to the 
paint shop in hopes of atta ining better wages. After two years, Sanchez 
wa promotcd to a higher position in tile shop but has not received higher 
pay. Confused amI wanting clear answers, both employees say they seek 
fairne s in return for the years of service they have given to UCS D's 
campus. 

"We JUSt want things to be fair," Sanchez said . "We do the same job, 
but without the same pay." 

What most concerns UC service empl oyees is tile availability of 
open Spots for higher position that remain closed off from workers

like Sanchez and Macedo - workers who are interested, but feel they 
are denied the opportunity. For example, the recent retirement of an 
employee in the paint shop has opened a position , but it has not been 
filled, according to Sanchez. 

UC Office of the President labor- relations spokesman 1 oel Van 
Nyhuis believes such open positions should be reviewed carefully. 

"If there is a position open, UC looks for the best pos ible candidate to 
fill the position," Van yhuis said. "We support tlleir moving up, but we 
also owe to our students the best possible candidate for the job." 

Service workers and unions like AFSCME 3299 are not alone in their 
endeavors to achieve higher wages. Students for Economic Justice, a 
student organization at UCSD, focuses on fair wages for underprivileged 
employees and has an agenda to educate students, faculty and the public 
about economic fairness. Past activities include the Justice for J anitors 
ca mpaign in 2001 and, more recently, protests against curring education 
in the state budget and supporting labor unions like AFSCME 3299. 

SE] member Lauren W alker is one of many students who values the 
importance of service employees at UCSD. 

"We feel they are essential," Walker sa id. "Without them, there 
wouldn't be a campus." 

SEJ's participation in the union strikes has shown student i.nterest and 
support for the se.rvice workers' situation . Snldent sentimem holds more 
power than most know, according to Walker. 

" \Nhen the university sees that studen ts care, it becomes a bigger 
issue," Walker said. "If you get everyone behind one thing, then they 
can't ignore us." . 

Service workers know students do not di regard the long hours they 
put into their work, according to Lawrence. 

"Without lSEJ] , [ don't know if we could have made it this far," 
Lawrence said. "The workers really appreciate it to see the students 
behind us. They supported and listened to us." 

While custodial workers come to (:ampus for the first shift from 4 
a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and for the graveyard shift from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., 
appreciation for what they do may not always be obvious. For IO-year 
PPS employee Reuben Camcho, it is respect and recognition for what 
workers do that is most important, and he asks students to consider the 
people who are rarely seen but whose presence is known when facilities 
are cleaned. Camcho insists that his fellow service workers are vital to the 
image of the university. 

"We are the backbone of the university," Camcho said. "We're the 
ones that make the university look good , and we're trying to make thing 
better." 

As his coffee grows cold and only a few more minutes of his break 
remain, Cerecero expresses regret for what he believes to be a lack of 
positive change that unions have on their employment. 

"If the union doesn't care, that's why people like us don't believe. It's 
very simple," he said. 

Some employees like Cerecero find themselves losing faith in the 
unions that are here to support them. But according to Lawrence, "The 
union is only as strong as the membe)"S are." T he desire for better treat-
ment is strong among service employees, but the.ir belief in how to 
accomplish this varies. 

"We need more people," Camcho said. "That's the problem right now. 
T here's more workload, and people are getting tired." 

Service workers in th e union will vote on the proposed contract 
berween the union and the university, and their decision to accept the 
univer ity's concessions - or not - will be deternuned by ¥ay 10. 
Lawrence and other workers ask themselves if it i worth it to accept the 
new deal at all when it does not address key issues, like a clear step-system 
plan. 

Throughout negotiations, the university has said that contract deci-
sions are dependent on this year's tight state budget. 

" [The contract) provides all we can hope to offer based on the com-
pact with the govel11or," Van Nyhuis said. 

What the union asks for simply may not be what the university can 
accomodate. For the time being, someone will always be available to 
make an omelet in the morning and a sandwich in the afternoon at the 
dining halls. Thc dishes witl be washed and th e floors will be swept clean . 
As people begin to pour into Geisel Library to study for finals , students 
walk across floors that were vacuumed the night before and go to class-
rooms that were cleared before lecture. 

With keen support for the cause of the union, mail-services worker 
Thomas Winson believes in the power of addressing employee's rights. 

" ]f you're doing the right thing, nothing can go against you. But J'm 
ju t tired of it," Winson said .

THE UCSDGUARDIAN MONDAY, MAY 9, 2005 

Tennis: Tritons avenge last year's loss to Vulcans 
conrinued from page 16 

6-6, when the first break of the 
match went to UCSD for a 7-6 
lead. Then they served out the 
match, givi ng U SD 3 3-0 match 
lead going into singles play, which 
meant that they needed only two 
wins for the victory, 

"Being up 3-0 after doubles is 
huge," LaPlante said. "This defi-
nitely helps US going into singles 
since it's very hard mentally to he 
down 0-3 and feel like you have a 
chance to wi n . Our doubles have 
really been playing well and the 
girls know how important it is to 
have a good start, and try and win 
at least two." 

The Tritons got their two 
singles victories very quickly, 
thanks to Dao and Malinow, Dao, 
playing in the final home match 
of her collegiate career, won 6-
0, 6- 1 against the Vulcans' Eve 
Viq uenault, as Malinow defeated 
Fujii, 6- 1, 6- 1, for the cli ncher. 
With her two victories (in si ngles 
and doubles), Malinow avenged 
hOth her losses in the first match-
up between UCSD and Hawaii-
Hi lo this season. Because matches 
during playoffs are play~d only to 
decision, play was suspended in all 
other matches, with Tritons ahead 
in all but one. 

T he day before, the Tritons 

posted a simi lar effort against Cal 
State Los Angeles, winning all 
three dou hies matches and pick-
i ng up two singles victories ve~y 
quickly for the 5 -0 shutout. ThiS 
time, Siddiqui and junior Leigh 
Roberts picked up the clinchers 
for UCSD with 6-0, 6-1 and 6-0, 

" Being up 3~O after 
doubles is huge . This defi~ 
mtely helps us going into 

singles since it is very hard 
mentally to be dmml O~ 3 
and feel like you have a 

chance to win." 
- Liz LaPlante, women's 

tennis coach 

6-0 victories, respectively. 
The 1-6 loss to Hawaii-

Hilo in the second round of last 
year's Western Regionals that 
denied UCSD the chance to go 
to Nationals made this victory 
even sweeter for the Tritons, who 

defeated the Vulcans earlier this 
yea r in a regular season match, 
7-2. Now, along with top-ranked 
BYU Hawaii, the Tritons will 
head to Nationals representing 
the Western Region in a pool of 
16 teams in tournament play to 
determine the top team in the 
nation . The tournament will be 
held in Altamonte Springs, Fla. 
from May 12 to May IS . 

"We have a good draw at 
Nationals," LaPlante said. "Since 
the draw is predetermined, there 
are no seeds; we play a team 
from the cast, which is usua l-
ly the weakest region, and then 
most likely will play Armstrong 
Atla ntic, which is ranked ahead 
of us."

Baseball: Boutilier ties UCSD record for 'wins UTe . LA JOLLA ' UCSD YOUR SOURCE FOR YOUR BEST TAN 
conrinr;ed from page 16 

game places him at the top of the 
UCSD single season record book 
with seven triples . 

On the mound , enior ace Logan 
Boutilier picked up his lOth win of 
the season, tying the UCSD single 
season record, 

"[t's kind of a relief," Boutilier 
(10-2) said about tying the record . 
Ult feels good because it's been 
a couple of weeks since people 
have srarted to talk about it. And 
I finally put together an outing 
good enough to where r acrually 
deserve to win and our team put 
up runs for me to win, so it's very 
nice." 

The TritOns completed their 
four-game sweep in !,rame two of 
the doubleheader with a 7-4 victory 
behind the bat of senior designated 
hitter J oel Clark, who led with 
three RBIs and the combined pitch-
ing of junior starter Ryan Leake 
(7-4) and freshman re lief pitcher 
Hunter Swanson. Swanson pitched 
three scoreless innings, giving up 
only one hit and one walk for the 
first save of his collegiate career. 

The Tritons have concluded 
their regular season and will play 
Cal Poly Pomona in the first round 
of the CCAA Tournament begin-
ning on May 12 in Chico, Calif.. 

Game four was the last home 
game for II seniors on the team: 
Matt Anderson, Brad Beltz, 
Boutilier, Joel Clark, Alex Gascon, 
Hernandez, Craig King, Ryan 
Langone, Shlomo Lipetz, Ricl')' 
Pinnochio and Robinson . The II 
seniors were honored before game 
one of the doubleheader. 

Pinnochio is second all-rime 
on runs scored and tied for third 
in doubles and trip les in a single 
season , He and Hernandez earned 
Second Team A11-CCAA Honors 
for the 2004 season. 

Hernandez is the all-time single 

season leader in hits with 85 and 
assists with 190, and has started 
every game for UCSD since his 
freshman year. 

"It kinda caught me by surp~i e, 
J didn't really think about it until 
now," Hernandez said of playing 
his last game at UCSD. "It's kind 
of amazing now that [ think about 
it. I think it's just pretry incredible 
and lucky that I got the chance to 
play everyday and haven't been 
hurt." 

The routines of baseball that 
Hernandez has grown accustomed 
ro are what he says he will miss the 
most, 

UThe team atinosphere, with the 
routine we go through with hitting 

before the game and stuff like lhat, 
is what I'll probably miss the most," 
he said. 

It did not occur to Boutilier 
either that it was his last regular 
sea on game at UCSD until after 
the doubleheader ended. 

"I \Va getting ready to pitch, 
and it didn't really hit me until the 
game was actually over," Boutilier 
said. "I was blown aback. This is 
the last time that ['m going to wear 
a uniform on this fie ld. And as soon 
as we broke on the outfield, 1 took a 
slow walk around the field and said 
"hi" to a couple of my friends on 
my team, and I'm still jusr kind of 
taking it all in and taking in all the 
moment ."

Triathletes take top 
honors at Nationals 

O'Brien and Felder win 
individual championships 
By MAnHEW GRANT 

Sports Editor 

lowering over their competition 
at the USA Triathlon Collegiate 
. ational Championship, UCSD 
brraduare students Brendan O'Brien 
and Amanda Felder eluded the pack 
to take first in the men's and women's 
races, respectively, in Lake Ilavasu, 
\riz. , on pril 16. Their teammates' 
strong finishes supported the indi-
vidua l champions, prompting the 
UC D men's ream to come home 
with second-place awards while the 
fivc-member women's squad mer-
ited a third-place finish. 

Retu rning to the cour c for 
a half- Ironman distance event 
on May 1 at Lake an Antonio, 
Ca lif. , the Tritons turned in an 
eighth -place finish at the Jamba 
Juice Wildflower Long Course 
Triathlon. 

Leading the way for UCSD on 
May 1, O'Brien fini hed the \.2-
mile swim, 56-miJe cycle and 13 .1-
mile ntn in two hours, two minute 
and 36 seconds to take first place 
in the collegiate overall results -
more than two fuJI minutes ahead 
of the econd-place finisher. 

The econd UC D finisher, 
graduate student captain Daniel 
Derkac, finished the last leg of 
the race just under 12 minute 
behind O ' Brien, for a 13 th-place 
time of 2: 14:20. Rounding out the 
top three for the Tritons men's 
team, sen ior Chris Burnham tied 
for 28th place in 2:27:07. 

Felder dominated the wom-
en 's race, taking first in her divi-
sion with a time of 2:18:39, and 
17th place in the collegiate over-
all results. Her performance was 
almo r seven minutes ahead of the 
second-place female finisher - a 
margin greater than any other two 
competitors - as she dominated 

the field . 
At the Collegiate ationals on 

April 16, for the first time in the 
history of the event, a male and 
female competitor from the same 
school ga rnered fir t place awards . 

O'Brien finished the first leg 
of the race, a 1,500-meter swim, 
just under the 19-minute mark 
in a pack of five athletes who 
were all vyi ng for seventh place as 
they entered the first tran ition. 
He maintained pace and remained 
in the thick of the front pack 
through the hilly 40-kilometer 
bike section, taking just over an 
hour to omplete the phase before 
a smooth transition to the 10-kilo-
meter run. Charging acro the 
course and averaging 5: 11 miles, 
O 'Brien moved forward to com-
plete the race 39 seconds ahead of 
the econd-place finishers. 

Derkacs combined a 22:21 
swim, a 1:05 :11 bike and a 36:19 
run for a total time of 2:05:30 to 
finish second among the Triton 
men and 25 th overall . 

Graduate student captain John 
Burke finished the race in 81 st 
place after a 24:20 swim, a 1 :08:51 
bike and a 34:58 run to turn in 
a complete time of 2: 14:02 and 
round out the top-three finishers 
for the UCSD men. 

Felder made an early push on 
the swim leg of the race, leaving 
the water in second place before 
overtaking first position with a 
swift transition to the bike. In the 
run, she conti nued to distance her-
self from the trailing pack. By the 
completion of the event, Felder 
e tablished a 2:30 lead on second 
place and turned in a time of 
2: 11 :23. 

The Jamba Juice Wildflower 
Long Course Triathlon event was 
the Tritons' last appearance of the 
successful 2005 campaign.

Tritons going to Nationals 
Women's tennis blanks Hawaii-Hila, 5-0 

By EVAN WANG 
Senior Staff Writer 

Following a two-year hiatus, 
the 11 th-ranked UCSD women's 
tennis team, led by head coach 
Liz LaPlante, is heading back to 
the CAA Division II National 
Tournament. 

After completing a regular 
season during which UCSD went 
17-3 , the Tritons earned the right 
to host matches against Cal State 
Los Angeles and University of 
Hawaii-Hilo in consecutive days, 
on May 6 and May 7. The Triton 
women swept both teams off the 
court, 5-0, picking up their sixth-
and seventh-s raight cQnsecutive 
victories since their loss against 
Abilene Christian on April 2. 

On May 7, the Tritons hit the 
orthview Courts to take on their 

rivals, the Hawaii-Hilo Vulcans. 
The team was all business, taking 
to the courts in matching yel-
low tops and white ski rts, unified 
and motivated. The atmosphere 
was intense, with supporters from 
both sides coming out in droves 
to watch the action. But UCSD 
took control of the match right 
from the get-go, and never gave 
the Vulcans a chance. 

Doubles play was all UCSD 
as the Tritons scored victories in 
all three matchups. No. 3 play-
ers senior Jasmin Dao and junior

2 spot, sophomores Katie McKee 
and Kristin Bronowicki secured 
two ea rly breaks en route to an 8-

day, the top pair of junior Tara

Baseball ends season with a sweep 
UCSD blanks Grand Canyon in last homestand 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

There isn't much that can slow 
down the UCSD men's baseball 
team, whose pitching has been 
nearly flawless and whose aggres-
sive offense produces runs at the 
most cntcial times. And for head 
coach Dan O'Brien, there 's no 
bener time to peak than at the end 
of the ,season. 

"I think this team is finally 
getting to where it needs to be," 
O'Brien said. "We've been trying 
to get there for three months and 
we're starting to play some very 
good baseball right now, which is 
exciting." 

Exciting is one way to describe 
CSD's (33-19 overall, 23-17 

California Collegiate thletic 
Association) four-game sweep of 
Grand Canyon (26-2 1) at Triton 
Baseball Field from May 6 through 
May 8, including another stellar 
performance on the mound by 
junior starter Byron Gntbman (5-
3). Reeling off a complete game 
shutout in his last tart, Grubman 
threw another complete game 
in the Tritons' 6-4 win against 

• rand Canyon University in game 
one on May 6. 

"\ think Byron had to over-
come some high expectations after 
a phenomenal freshman year," 
O'Brien said. "And it's hard to 
do when you know that every 
team that YOll compete against has 
a book on YOll and knows what 
you're gonna throw; you have to 
learn to sti ll get outs. r think 
we're coming to the end of a 
very important maturing process 
for Gnlbman. ['m rea lly proud 
of him." 

Down 4-2, Grand Canyon 
drove in a ntn apiece in the ev-
cnth and eighth innings to tie 
it at 4-4. [t looked like a 1-2-3 

inning for the Antelopes, but cen-
terfielder Brian Smith dropped 
a fly ball hit by senior short-
stop Keith Hernandez, allowing 
the Tritons offense to corne up 
with a pair of clutch runs with 
two outs. O'Brien sent in fresh-
man Chris Hom to pinch hit for 
senior outfielder Brad Beltz, and 
the rookie delivered with a single 
up the middle to drive Hernandez 
home. Hom reached second on 
a throwing error and Gra nd 
Canyon went to its bullpen, send-
ing Kyle Holtorf to relieve Scon 
Welch. With Langone on second 
as a pinch runner for Hom, junior 
leftfielder David Gomez drove in 
Langone to reclaim the lead for 
UCSD,6-4. 

"I knew we were going to come 
back and score a run ," Grubman 
said. "We put up two, which was 
nice, but [ knew we were going to 
come back and we were going to 
win the game." 

The Antelopes threatened 
again in the ninth, putting two 
ntnners aboard, but Grubman 
capped off a gutsy perfornlance by 
striking out Branden Ishikawa for 
the final out, earning his fifth win 
of the season . 

" f was making good pitches 
and they were hitting good pitch-
es, so I figured if I kept mak-
ing my pitches, they'd roll over," 
Grubman said. 

UCSD brought its momentum 
to game twO on May 7 where senior 
first baseman Brian Robinson 
broke open a 5-5 tie with a three-
ntn home run in the fourth inning 
to secure the Tritons' 9-6 win. 
The bullpen was also key for the 
Tritons with junior Matthew 

weany (2 -0) relieving starter Jose 
avarro (4-4) for three innings, 

giving up three hits and one run 
for his second save of the sea 011. 

SD's bats continued to 

pound away at Grand Canyon in 
game three, which saw six differ-
ent Tritons recording an RBI, 
led by junior rightfielder Matt 
Lawson who went 2-for-4 with 
four RBIs. His RBI triple in the
