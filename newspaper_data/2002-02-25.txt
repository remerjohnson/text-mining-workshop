As part of a weeklong 
event that benefited local 
charities, the WinterFest 
2002 UCSD Cares 
Campaign kicked off Feb. 19 
on Library Walk and capped 
off Feb. 22 with the 
WinterFest 2002 concert, 
featuring local sensation 
Jason Mraz, punk group 
Fenix TX and R&B group 
City High. 

More than 3,500 students 
attended the concert. 

With all of the expecta-
tions and hype leading up to 
Friday night's concer t, the 
idea of charity remained the 
key focus in many students' 
minds. 

As Robby Pardlo of City 
High put it, "Charity is 
important and any way we 
can give back is cool." 

WinterFest 2002 and the 
UCSD Cares Campaign 
g ive a little something of 
their own to a greater cause.

Fee referendum 
being pondered 
Athletics task force concludes that an 
increase in student fees is the solution 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

In the face of a sizable cut to 
UCSD's athletics deparmlent bud-
get, the A.S. Task Force on 
Intercollegiate Athletic Funding 
Issues recommended to the A.S . . 
Council on Wednesday that a fee 
referendum for athletics funding be 
a part of the upcoming elections 
ballot. 

The suggested referendum 
would incur a $26.50 quarterly 
charge to students for the Jurpose 
of maintaining the current level of 
athletics programming. 

When Ur: D chose to move to 
Division II in 2000, Vice 
Chancellor Joseph Watson provid-
ed $3 million from reserves to fund 
the transition. This money will run 
out next year, and the athletics bud-
get will be cut in half if no addi-
tional funding is found. 

The task force concluded that 
the only way to raise the money was 
through a referendum. 

Newly appointed A.S. 
Commissioner of Athletics Robin 
Shelton chaired the task force, 
which included representatives 
from each college, Triton Athletes 
Council, the A.S. Council, Triton 
Tide and three at-large representa-
tives. Several of the representatives 
are athletes. 

"The purpose of this is solely to 
maintain our current funding 
level," Shelton said. "It is the best 
possible thing that could be done, 
given our situation." 

Cat Nolan, the Warren college 
representative and a member of 
UCSD's track and field team, said 
the referendum must pass the 
council and the srudent body. 

"If the referendum doe not 
pass, I feel sorry for tile student 
body," Nolan said. "It would be 
detrimental to the morale and spi r-
it of UCSD. I do not want to come 
back as an alumni next year and see 
an athletic program stripped of its 
parts. " 

The task force looked at other 
options, including sponsorships , 
donations, apparel rights , conces-
sions, fund-raising, registration 
fees, sports camps, and radIO and 
television, but ruled them out 
because they were deemed either 
infeasible or would not provide 
enough funding. 

"All options were carefully 
looked at and eva~uated so that the 
final product of the task force 
would be the best for the students," 
said TAC representative Steve 
Martin. "I feel that is what hap-
pened since the task force was all 
student-run and student-initiated."

San Diego politicians 
speak at campus forum 
Few turn out to hear elected officials 
discuss campus, local and state issues 
By CARLAN WENDLER 
Senior Staff Writer 

A group of four elected officials 
addressed UCSD students, staff 
and faculty Friday regarding cur-
rent political issues pertinent to the 
San Diego region. 

State Sen. Dede Alpert, 
Califo rnia Assemblywoman 
Christine Kehoe, City Councilman 
Scott Peters and San Diego City 
Attorney Casey Gwinn spoke at the 
event. 

Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
and other UCSD officials also 
attended the forum. 

The forum took place at the 
Copley Auditorium at the 
Graduate chool of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies .. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
senior John Lek, an intern in pub-
lic policy at the San Diego 
Regional Chamber of Commerce, 
helped plan the forum to increa e 
political involvement among San 
Diego'S students. 

"My goal is to get tudents more 

involved, to combine the interests 
of the students and the Chamber of 
Commerce," Lek said. 

About 30 people attended the 
forum. 

Planners and representatives 
alike were a little discouraged by 
the small turnout, especially in 
light of the influence the speakers 
have in shaping policy that affects 
UCSD. 

"It's disappointing that more 
students don't come out to get to 
know their representatives," Lek 
said. 

The politicians called for 
increased political participation 
from students. 

"With 55,000 students [in the 
San Diego area), you could own 
us," Peters said. 

"1 hear from people who have a 
stake in the past of San Diego, 
[but) you are the people who have 
a stake in the funlre of this town," 
he said. 

The politicians maintained an

impacts this policy will have for peo-

She said there were many factors 
in her decision to apply for the posi-
tion. 

"With such low numbers of people 
of color on this campus, recent propo-
sitions like Propositions 21 and 22, 
the events of Sept. II and subsequent 
ac ts of racial profiling and violent hate 
crimes, UCSD is in a state of crisis," 
Medrano said. "In fact, this nation is 
in a state of crisis. I mink it was a wise 
and just decision to create this posi-
tion in order to make sure this crisis, 
at least at UCSO, is being addressed 
and taken seriously. I applied for this 
position with the UCSD community 
in mind." 

. Shelton has been working as the 
commissioner of athletics since his 
unanimous appointment by the coun-
cil )an. 16. His charter was approved 
Feb. 6. 

Shelton said his office should 
encompass not just working wim the 
amletics programs on campus, but 
also working with other people and 
organiz..1tions to IOcrease spirit and 
enthusiasm for athletics. 

"The general goal is to try to 
increase the level of campus spirit 
through athletics," Shelton said. 

Some of me office of the commis-
sioner of athletics' projects include 
increasing me visibility of the spirit 
organization Triton Tide, advertising 
more events such as next Friday's bas-
ketball game against UC Davis (hence 
the signs campuswide that read "7 
days to cowtipping"), pushing for 
blue and gold awnings in the Price 
Center, and working to put up signs 
to invoke Triton spirit at the RIMAC 
weight room.

Pediatrics professor to help 
lead new medical journal 

Martin Stein, professor of pediatrics at the UCSD 
school of medicine, was recently named associate 
editor of the new Journal Watch Pediatrics and 
Adolescent Medicine. 

UCSD researchers find 
osteoporosis drug helpful 

UCSD led a wor1dwide study to test the effec-
tiveness of raloxifene HCI, a drug used to combat 
osteoporosis. The study found that it does not cause 
cardiovascular harm. 

The research concluded that raloxifene reduced 
the risk of cardiovascular disease for 40 percent of 
postmenospausal women with osteoporosis when it 
was compared to a placebo. 

Professor of family and preventive medicine at 
the school of medicine Elizabeth Barrett-Connor 
served as principal investigator for the Multiple 
Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation study, in which 
7/705 postmenospausal women from 180 sites in 
25 countries were analyzed. The study tracked data 
from a four-year period during which the drug was 
administered to patients. 

Raloxifine producers Eli Lilly and Company fund-
ed the study, which appears in the Feb_ 20 issue of 
the Journal of the American Medical Association 

Stein will attend to issues of developmental and 
behavioral medicine for the J~. His primary 
focus will be on research artides dealing with early 
recognition and child and adolescent issues r~ard­
ing behavioral problems, educational underachieve-
ment and family conflict. Murdered Wall Str~et Journal

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES - For nearly a month, 
Daniel Pearl's father, UCLA professor Judea Pearl, 
waited for news about the fate of his son. Thursday, 
he leamed that his worst fears were true. 

At his home in Encino, Calif., Pearl, a computer 
science faculty member since 1970 when Daniel 
was just 7/ received word from the u.s: Department 
of State that videotape evidence confirmed his son 
had been killed. 

A reporter for the Wall Street Journal, Daniel was 
kidnapped Jan. 23 in Karachi, Pakistan. That night he 
was on his way to interview the leader of an extrem-
ist Muslim ~roup with possible ties to alleged 'shoe 
bomber" Richard C. Reid. The 38-year~ld journalist 
never retumed. 

Pakistani authorities said a videctape they obtained 
showed Daniel bei~ killed by the Islamic extremists 
who kidnapped him a month ago. The U.s. 
Department of State did not say v"hen Pearl was kiled.

The UCSD literature depart-
ment employs 13. T he math 
department employs just four. T he 
history department clocks in wi th 
a tally of 31. 

Lectu rers nontenured 
instructors who generally do not 
enjoy the same job security and 
benefits as professors - are every-
where at UCSD , an immutable 
fi xture of educa tion within the 
U niversity of Ca li fo rnia. 

Lecturers are the only universi-
ty- level instructors whose com-
mitment is clearl y and undeniably 
to teaching, as they are not livi ng 
within the bounds of the ten ure 
track's "publish or perish" world. 
And, ironically for uch a group at 
a university committed to teaching 
excellence, lecturers do without 
many benefits accorded to tenured 
faculty, such as higher salaries, 
pre tigc and innuence. 

Lecturers shape our educa tion 

and thought, and they teach most 
of our classes: According to the 
UC Undergraduate Instruction 
and Faculty Teaching Activities 
Report, released in July ~OOO, half 
of all graduate and undergraduate 
UC classes were taught by lectur-
ers in 1998- 1999. 

Because they are not called 
upon to conduct research, lectur-
ers carry heavy course loads and 
bear the brunt of instruction for 
many lower- and upper-division 
classes. Full professors, propound-
ed as the torch bearers illuminat-
ing the way of knowledge for stu-
dents, often teach as little as one 
class per quarter, if any. Naturally, 
they can be heavily involved in 
re earch as part of their scholarly 
activity, but the brunt of teaching 
then falls to other instructors. One 
lecturer I know teaches three 
lower-division classes and heads an 
independent study course. 

UC Se nate facul ty are tenure-
track profes ors with opportuni -
ties for adva ncement on the acade-

mic ladder. Lecturers, by contrast, 
do not number within senate fac-
ul ty and do not enjoy the same 
opportunities. Though there exists 
one senate position for lecturers 
- lecturer with security of 
employment - there is a paucity 
of lecturers actually accorded that 
status. 

Most lecturers are hired osten-
sibly to fill in the gaps when there 
is a shortage of instructors in a 
particular fie ld. Consequently, 
they are ofren perceived as "tem-
porary," and treated as such, when 
in fact many lecturers are anything 
but that: Up to 30 percent of UC 
courses taught by lecturers are 
headed by instructors who have 
been with the university for more 
than six years. These scholars 
carry the burden of inten e course 
loads and fulfill the long-term 
needs of the university, but they do 
so as "temporary" employees. 

The University of California 
ougbt to offer tenure-track 
employment and advancement 

opportunities to these instructors . 
However, like many other 
instances within the UC system, 
money, not quality, steers the fate 
of education. 

Hiring tenure-track professors 
is expensive and involves a long-
term commitment, whereas the 
university can snap up lecturers 
for no-frills, three-year contracts 
at paltry starting salaries. There is 
no published salary scale for lec-
turers within the UC system, and 
only two opportunities for merit 
increases - raises based on a pos-
itive performance review - per 
contract term. 

There are few other occupa-
tions in which a scholar with a 
doctorate from a top university 
can be expected to be content with 
$30,000 per year and an uncertain 
career future. 

If the University of California 
wishe to be perceived as an entity 
that perpetuates equality and fair-
ness in education, it has certainly 
demonstrated-- th at it ha a long

way to go. 
In the realm of teaching, the 

university should realize that 
instructional quality is instruction-
al equality: All UC mstructors 
should be accorded the respect 
and career opportunities reason-
able for anyone teaching at the 
worlds finest public university sys-
tem. 

The University of California 
has demonstrated its commitment 
to attracting high-profile, presti-
gious scholars at the tOP of their 
fields. It should extend this com-
mitment and include its current 
faculty in that estimation. Instead 
of inflating the salaries of just a 
few positions, it should create 

. more tenure-track p·osi tions to 
attract a broad base of quality 
instructors and researchers. 

Lecturers have paid their dues 
to the University of California and 
its students for years. The univer, 
sity, in turn, should be prepared to 
reward the loyalty and excellence 
of its teaching staff.

By ALEX J. LE~ 
Senior Staff Writer 

For the pas t few years, there 
has been an o ngoing de bate 
between Sea World and the City of 
San Diego. Due to the cutthroat 
competitiveness of the theme park 
busi ness, Sea World has conti I1u-
ously pushed expansion plans in an 
cffon to copy other successful 
theme parks. 

Sea World continues to argue 
that its plans are m erely an inno-
cent response to g rowing con-
cerns over lackl uster attenda nce. I 
si de wi th the many other San 
Diega ns who oppose such a ven-
ture. 

A San Diego City Coun ci l 
heari ng in July 200 1 voted 8- 1 in 
favor of the SeaWorl d Master 
Plan Update, a land-use policy 
doc ument that approves several . 
of the park's new projects, 
includ ing a 95- foot "splash -
down ride" and a new front-ga te 
attraction . 

Even earl ier, there was another 
notorious ba llot measure: 1998's 
Proposition D, which exempted 
Sea World froll1 a 3D-foot heigh t 
limit on new construction alo ng 
San Diego's coastl ine. 

Ma ny locals opposed the mea-
sure because they felt anything 
higher than 30 feet would be an 
eyesore. 

I do not like that Sea World can 
skirt the 30;foot· restriction 
imposed by voters in 1972, though 
all other San Diego busi nesses 
must fo ll ow it. It sends the mes-
sage that the park can continue to 
slip tl1rough legal loopholes in its 
efforts to create another corporate 
clone of Disneyland at the center 
of Mission Bay. . 

Park officia ls have adamantly 
defended thei r mission: to run a 
marine pa rk aimed at conservation 
and ed.ucation, n ot an amusement 
park. Indeed, unlike its competi-
tors such as Knott's Berry Farm 
and Dis neyland, Sea Wo rl d has 
had to defend its legitimacy con-
stan tly. 

To achieve these goa ls in a 
com petitive market, ir is necessary 
to take some li berties - but seri-

nated for entertainment purposes. 
The park already fails to meet the 
75-25 mandate. 

Much of determini ng what 
attractions fit the 75 percent is 
subjective, but adding rides for 
hln alone worsens [he ratio . In 
other word, for every "hln" ride 
the park adds, several animal 
exh Ibits of purely educational 
value must accompany them, 
according to the mandate. 
Expansion becomes overwhelm-
ing in this manner.

T his example might be forgiv-
able, though - or at least under-
standable. After all, tile park is 
owned by the beer-brewing giant 
An heuser-Busch. Even the 

Clydesd~les, the park argues, are 
educa tiona!. 

Under a recent city order, 
which mandates that at least 75 
percent of Sea World's attractions 
conform to its original tl,eme of 
conserva tion and education, plans 
for expansion could only fall unrl~r 
the 25 percent of attractions desig-

surprisingly, 
expansio n is a 

growing trend among all of the 
parks, the most notab le example 
being Disney's California 
Adventure. 

Unfortunately for SeaWorld, 
however, attendance has been 
lackluster. According to the park, 
attendance actua lly declined 1 per-
cent between 1990 and 1999. The 
park's s[rategy in attracting more 
people has been in selling its new 
image as a revamped "adventure 
park." 

Sea World 's coneuct reeks of 
shad tJless. Opponents of the 1998 
height exemprion ballot initiative 

accused it of being vaguely word-
ed to a void suspicion from the 
voting public. As a result , the 
poorly financed activists who 
opposed the .measure found 
themselves fighting a tJluch nch-
er and better-organized oppo-
nent. 

The proposition pa,sed hy a 
margin of 0.7 percent amid accu-
sations that Sea\Vorld disguised 
the expansion-friendly ballot as a 
vote to save wildlife. 

Advocates of the park' expan-
sion accuse a tivists of exaggerat-
ing claims of commercia lization . 
However, Sea \Vorld already has 
plans for a 45-foot-high parking 
garage and transit station, and a 
90-foot-tall hate!' 

The park also rejected the city's 
recommendation to build a puhlic 
bike and pedestrian path on the 
part of Mi sian Bay that Sea \ \ 'orld 
occupies. 

One wonders whether the park 
has lost all sight of the concerns of 
its neighbors in favor of wooing 
more money from everyone Out-
side San Diego. 

Although Sea World is privately 
owned, San Diegans should feel 
more than able to shout their con-
cerns to this theme park behe-
moth, especially because the park 
leases a 189 acre, city-owned 
Mission Bay Park site. 

Sea World is a significant asset 
to San Diego'S tourist indll>try, 
which is one of the reasons the 
issue is being so closely scrutinized 
by industry insiders and laypersons 
alike. 

In fact, according to the park'"

, ditor: 

I li nd it qu ite amusing, yet some-
what disturhlng, that it takes a desig-
nated "Spirit Night" to get students 
interes ted enough to anend a UCSD 
athletic event. To me, those with true 
spirit are the ones enthusiastic 
enough to attend Oll t of free will. 
Attending athletic events is a great 
experience, not something to be 
ashamed of. 

Last weekend, I grabbed a few 
friends and traveled to Northridge 
and Santa Barbara, where we saw the 
UCSD men' volleyball team play. 
True, the team may not be a national 
powerhouse, but going to RIMAC 
Arena with a few others and heckling 
visiting team until our throats hurt 
is lot of fun , 

Nlany may not realize the power 
of our ice hockey squad. which has 
had substantial victories over UCLA, 
Berkeley, USC and San Diego State 
University, alllong others. It has 
been invited to its first-ever national 
championship tournament, to be 
held March 1-3 in Georgia, earning a 
second seed in the West bracket. 
Attending home games at UTC and 
supporting a winning team makes for 
a great time. 

Lacrosse opens its home season as 
we speak, while baseball is also on 
the horizon. These are by no means 
dull sports, either. 

I feel we're kidding ourselves to 
portr:lY one night a year as a symbol 
of rrue UCSD spirit. Those students 
and fans who acrually show up often 
do ~o to suppOrt friends, or because 
they just love the sport. The seed for 
rea l athleti c support is there. The 
constdnt complaints of "\Nhy should 
we support a sub-par, Division 1] 
program empty of 'my notoriety?" 
are useless. Nothing will change 
unless snldents stop whining and 
take action. 

I challenge every UCSD snldent 
to take a few nights off, choose a few 
athletic events and come make some 
noise. It never hurts to go a linle 
crazy. Showing continuous support 
as students and as fans is what real 
"spirit" is all about.

Column: 
Democracy is best

Continued from page 5 
ing speakers into an entirely new 
perspective on the possibilities 
and consequences of sensors and 
monitoring in society. 

Brin contends that a move 
toward ubiquitous sensor technol-
ogy is imminent and lmstoppable. 
However, he challenges both the 
notions of civil libertarians and 
the attorney genera l when he 
maintains that increased monitor-
ing capabilities do not necessarily 
translate to a loss in freedom for 
individual ci tizens. 

Brin points ou[ that no gov-
ernment has had as much infor-
mation accessible at a glance 
about its individual citizens as the 
modern Western democracies, yet 
no people are freer. The axiom 
that increased data means 
decreased freedom comes under 
attack by this apparent paradox, 
and Brin contend that reverse 
transparency - wherein citizens 
monitor their government and 
the systems at work - is the key 
to avoiding an Orwellian scenario. 

Brin's words come at a time 
when a witch-hunt aOllO phere 
permeates our creation of laws 
Illeant to "protect" our basic free-
doms. r t struck me that intelligent 
dialogue of this kind, which thinks 
beyond traditional political lines 
and rhetoric, is just as critical to

numerous research posters and 
corporate technology exhibits 
that surrounded me. 

Research Review, no doubt, is 
an even headier e';'ent for those 
who can actually understand what 
the posters are saying, but the 
sociological consequences of 
technology, along with all sorts of 
forward-looking thought, should 
be given footing equal to forward-
looking science. \Vhy aren't 
undergraduate students invited to . 
mill about at an on-campus event 
where progressive, nonstandard 
'political and sociological thoughts 
are put up for display? ome may 
argue that Library Walk qualifies 
on one of those fair days, but 
there is a clear difference between 
intelligent thought and rehashed 
rhetoric. 

The only poster I saw that 
included some degree of sociolog-
ica l research was by William 
Gris\vold's team in computer sci-
ence and engineering, which was 

e.~a1Tlini ng the effects of giving 
personal digital ass istants to fresh~ 
men to communicate in lecnlre 
and track one another on campus. 

Brin is perhaps a living illus-
tration of this importance. One of 
the most famous alumni of 
UCSD's electrical e'ngineeri ng 
and physics departments is nei-
ther academic researchet nor 
businessman, fields on which the 
school of engineering so of Len 
focuses. Brin 's doctorate in space 
physics from UCSD led to an 
illustrious science-fiction writing 

should also realize what it is try-
ing to sell. 

Critics fear that Sea World's 
expansion will lead to increased 
commercialization of the area, 
overpriced admission, question-
able attractions, and increased 
traffic and pollution . 

All this would come in

career, with Brin winning several 
prominent awards for his novels. 
That seems ironic, given the rela-
tive size of our literature depart-
ment, and how mueh Warren 
engineering majors grumble 
about having to take "Ethics and 
Society" and finish an unrelated 
program of concentration. 

Perhaps it is an elitist thing to 
say, but it is irritating to see rele-
vant and interesting basic research 
reduced to the lowest common 
denominator of "homeland 
defense." With all due respect to 
the speakers on Friday, Brin clear-
ly illustrated the dichotomy 
between two modes of thought on 
research. T he first is to respond to 
popular political rhetoric and try 
to gain funding for what you do 
best by showing the broadest 
potential application most likely 
to appeal to people's fears (in this 
case, of domestic attack). Or you 
can thin k outside political 
rhetoric, and try to apply funding 
and gear your research toward a 
"better, freer society" rather than 
a "nationally safe" onc. 

Or perhaps the engineering 
majors here do not have time in 
the span of five years to think 
about taking something useless 
such as sociology, political science 
or classical rhetoric when they are 
in uch a rush to get an NlBA.

Enjoying the show: A crowd surfer is pulled out by security at Friday's annual WinterFest concert. This was not an 
uncommon sight as the crowd of more than 3,500 carried several eager fans on their shoulders throughout the night. 

WinterFest: 
Blood, cash, cans and 
clothes were donated 
Continued from page 1 
a charity event," said freshman 
Donald Povieng. "In fact, I donat-
ed to the ca nned food drive 
myself." 

The campaign, presented by 
the A.S. Council and led by Event 
Programmer Eisha Christian, 
invo lved organizations uch as the 
United \tVav, various fraternities 
and sororiiies , and numerous 
campus ervl ce and fu ndraising 
clubs. 

This yea rs \NintcrFcst theme 
was "Pick Your Causel Choose 
Your Charityl" and like previous 
vVinrerFests, it proVlded students 
wi tl1 a va riety of ways to give back 
to the community. 

Activities included a blood drive 
at Earl Warren College, making 
bookmarks for underprivileged 
schoolchildren , maki ng get:'well 
cards for AIDS/HN patients, bake 
sales, dunk tanks, canned food and 
clothing drives, and general dona-
tions of money and time toward 
service organizations. 

"The goal of the UCSD Cares 
Campaign is to bring back the spir-
it of community and the spirit of 
gi>ing back to the community," 
said WinterFest co-coordinator 
Michael Hayes. "We hope to make 
students aware of the different 
charities represented here this 
week." 

Thirty-one organizations joined 
in the cause. Each organization 
represented a particular charity, 
and they channeled all of their pro-
ceeds and collections to the charity 
of their choice. 

Larger organizations such as the 

San Diego United Way encour-
aged students to donate their time 
toward a worthy cause by volun-
teering. 

"Each year the Uni ted Way has 
a campaign on the campus of 
UCSD," said Dan Wyman, co-
chair of the UCSD United Way, 
"This year we hope to do better 
than ever." 

A smaller organization, the Pi 
Beta Phi so rority, publicized an 
event it will be holding in May to 
benefit the San Diego Children's 
Hospital. 

"We are promoting a dance 
that will be taki ng place on May 
16," said .'\Jl ison Milbank of Pi 
Beta Phi . 

"It 's a ' 70s disco party and 
we've be doi ng It for the past cou-
ple years. Las t year we raised 
abom $1,500 to buy books for the 
Chi ldren's H ospital's library col-
lection," she said. 

Other groups such as Marshall 
Colleges'S Active Community 
Thurgood raised money for the 
San Diego Red Cross and the 
International Peace Kit Project by 
providing a dunk tank on Library 
Walk. 

"' '''e have students from various 
walks of life on campus volunteer-
ing to be dunked, including A.S. 
President Jeff Dodge," said Gina 
Fiore of Marshall A.C.T. "So far, 
we are doing wonderfully with the 
dunk tank. So hopefully this will 
become a tradition." 

As a charity incentive, ~tudenrs 
who made a donation to a service 
drive got their names on a iogo sign 
to be placed in the UCSD 

Boo~tore corner display. Other 
incentives included daily drawings 
for prizes and a free A.S. Council -
sponsored barbeque Friday. 

In all, the event raised over 
$1,000 for individual charities, 

377 handmade ca rds fo r 
AlDS/HIV patients, over 90 
bookmarks for schoolchildren, 
630 cans of food, 320 hygiene and 
toiletry products, 800 articles of 
clothing, 210 toys, 43 school sup-
ply items, 273 pints of blood that 
will save an estimated 209 lives 
and more than 150 volunteer 
sign-ups for events that include 
tutoring and beach clean-ups. 

The UCSD Bookstore and 
Sunshine Store also contributed a 
large amount by giving a portion of 
its sales and leftover change col-
lected during customer purchases 
toward the United Way of San 
Diego. 

"We've corne a long way since 
WinterFest fi rst started with 
canned food drives," Hayes said. 
"The idea was that we don't have to 
give cha rity once a · year, like 
around Christmas time. We can do 
it all year-round. I think we got the 
message through." 

Smdents' reactions toward the 
weeklong event were posi tive. 

"I like what I've seen this week," 
said UCSD student Sherri Bender. 
"This year it seems like there were 
more activities and more of an 
effort from students. It's good for 
the community." 

While the charity was good for 
the San Diego community, the 
UCSD community came out to see 
the performers Friday night. 

"1 came here to see Jason Mraz 
mainly 'cause I'm a huge fan," said 
UCSD student Jessica Venturi. "1 
think it's gonna be great 'cause he 's 
an awesome performer." 

Others, such as freshman Bobby 
Kim, came to see all three acts per-
form. 

"I'm hoping to see City High 
and Fenix TX," Kim said. "I heard 
that Jason Mraz is awesome with 
the acoustic guitar and drums."

Proposal: 
Extra money needed to 
maintain athletic funding 
Continued from page 1 

Martin is also an athlete, and 
comperes on the men's cross 
country and track and field teams. 

San Bernardino, Cal Poly 
Pomona, Cal State Bakersfield 
and Cal State Los Angeles, all of 
which are UCSD's competitOrs. 

Shelton pointed to the teams' 
travel budgets. UCSD sports 
teams travel to their away games 
the day of the event, instead of the 
night before, to save money. Other 
teams are then better rested and 
not jet-lagged, while UCSD ath-

that the quality of the social envi-
ronment and athletic programs,

would drop if the referendwn fails .

the referendum fails, UCSD does 
not have the option of returning to

Funding Issues, which submitted a 
recommendation to the A.S. 
Council on the problem of funding 
facing the athletics 

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2002 

"He works hard and gets whatever 
he needs to done in order to better 
the campus. Serving as the director 
of athletic relations previous to his 
commissioner of athletics move, 
Robin has proved himself a leader 
to match all leaders. " 

Shelton , a Warren junior, 
played for UCSD's men's golf team 
for two years. He stopped playing 

for various rea -
sons. 

If the A.S. Council approves 
rhe task force's recommendation, 
the fee referendum of $26.50 will 
appear on the ballot econd week 
of spring quaner. Most of the fec 
will go to intercollegiate athletics, 
$1 will go to the sports clubs and 
25 cents will go to the recreation 
clubs. 

helton stressed that the refer-
endum is designed only to main-
tain UCSD's current program and 
not to improve it. 

"This is something that main-
rains the Chevy status," he said. 
"I t 's not the Lexus, it's not the 
Rolls Royce." 

'The referendum is 
just one of the ways to 

ask students to join 
together for a 

common cause that 
can benefit all of us in 

the end. We will be 
glad we did.' 

- Steve Martin 
TAe representative 

Martin said he believes the ref-
erendum is important for reasons 
other than just maintaining fund-
ing. 

"The referendum is just one of 
the ways to ask students to join 
together for a common cause that 
can benefit all of us in the end," he 
said. 

"We will be glad we did. I hope 
the trend of increased athletic sup-
port continues in the future and 
creates a forum for students to 
support and encourage our 
teams," Martin said. 

The task force's recommenda-
tion will come on the table at the 
A.S. Council meeting Wednesday 
at 5:3 0 p.m. in Price Center

programs. 
Shelton said he 

ran for the posi-
tion beca use he 
"can make more of 
a difference doing 
this than doing 
anything else." 
Dodge said he 
believes Shelton is 
the best person for 
the job. 

Shelton served 
as the director of 
athletics relations 
in the chancellor's 
office prior to the 
crea tion of the 
commissioner 

'From his psy-
chotic passion to 
have the awnings 

in the Price 
Center changed 

to blue and gold, 
to his crazed 

prank calls to UC 
Davis, Robin is 

the perfect fit for 
this position.' 

One reason he 
gave was the time 
commitment 
involved with his 
A.S. Council posi-
tions. As for the 
time he used to 
spend playing golf, 
he said, "i t's been 
taken up by all this 
stuff." 

"Robin is 
incredibly moti-
vated and always 
thinks of new ways 
to approach 
events, issues and 
programs," Dodge 
said. 

UCSD's 23 intercollegiate 
sports teams now operate on a 
budget of $2.4 mi llion per year. 
UC Davis, also in Division II, has 
25 sports running on a budget of 
$7 million. UC Davis students 
currently pay $76 per quarter for 
athletics. 

UCSD averages $104,000 per 
sport, well below the averages of

said. 

The task force's recommenda-
tion lists potential consequences of 
the referendum's failure. 
According to the recommenda-
tion, the decrease in funding 
"would produce a negative cloud 
over the university." 

The r('commendation states 

I t must pass the council to 
become a student fee referendum. 

"Over the past two years with 
the temporary funds, the task force 
feels as if the students and campus 
have received a 'sneak preview' of 
what UCSD athletics are capable of 
and what it does for the university," 
states the task force's recommenda-
tion.

Dodge said 

that Shelton was the natural 
choice. 

"Robin is a motivated, experi-
enced individual who has a strong 
reputation in the A.S. and within 
the athletics community," he said.

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2002 THE UCSD GVARDIAN FEATURES 9 

, IOn each's park still brings 'em in 

Saw the sign: Belmont Park, at the corner of Mission Boulevard and West Mission Bay Drive, is one 
of the California coas~s oldest amusement parks - it's been thrilling visitors for 77 years. 

Around and around: San Diegan Mark introduces his two daughters, 2-year-old Skyla (left) and 4-
year-old Alexis (right), to the Liberty Carousel, a reproduction of an antique carousel. 

Goalie training: Parent Dan gives 3-year-old Carmine a lesson in air hockey, one of the many 
arcade attractions at Belmont Park's Family Fun Center. 

South of Pacific Beach, west of Mission Bay and just east of the warm sa nds of ~" Mission Beach is a sight unique in San 
Diego: a roller coaster, and an antique one at 
that. 

The coaster - the Giant Dipper - was 
built during the era of flappers, had its heyday 
during World War II, fell into disrepair while 
flower children were the rage, and was resur-
rected while most UCS D students were learn-
ing long division. 

Belmont Park, the amusement park sur-
rounding the Giant Dipper, opened in 192 5 as 
the Mission Beach Amusement Center, the 
pet project of San Diego sugar magnate John 
D. Spreckels. It was his funding that brought 
the 2,600-foot long coaster to life. The Gia rl t 
Dipper was built in less than two months by a 
crew of more than 100 workers. T he entire 
project COSt only $150,000. 

The coaster had its first go-round on July 
4,1925, JUSt a few short weeks after the park 
itself opened. 

As San Diego grew in the 1930s and 19405, 
the park enjoyed growing popularity. It was 
late in the 1940s thdl the Mission Beach 
Amusement Center was renamed Belmont 
Park. 

T he park hit hard times in the late 1960s 
and earl y 1970s and eventually closed down in 
December 1976. 

Belmont Park faced its most troubling 
times in the early 1980s when city officials 
decided to demolish the Giant Dipper, which 
had become an eyesore in the community 
after surviving several fires and becoming the 
home of transients. 

The Giant Dipper may well have been 
demolished if not for the work of a group of 
concerned citizens who called themselves the 
"Save the Coaster Committee." These people 
rallied around the coaster and had it designat-
ed a national landmark. 

The rights to the coaster were transferred 
from the city to the "Save the Coaster 
Committee," which tried to raise enough 
money to restore it. When committee mem-
bers failed to raise the necessary money, they 
turned to the Santa Cruz Seaside Company, 
the owners of the boardwalk in Santa Cruz, 
Cal if., to help renovate the coaster. 

Belmont Park retail specialty center. 
Since its reopening, the coaster has heen 

the sire of twO "Whirl 'Til You Hurl" compe-
titions hosted by local radio station STAR 
100.7. Belmont Park itself has also hit the 
national spoclight as the sire of MTV's "SoCnl 
Surruner" in the summer of 2000. 

Today, interested parties ca n brave the 
insanity that is pdrlcing at Belmont to peruse 
the various shops that line the path going 
through Belmont Park. 

There are also other rides designed for 
those not quite brave enough for the mighty 
wooden coaster. A historic carousel along 
with a three-story vertical plunge, bumpcr 
cars and a tilt-a-whirl are all main attractions 
at the park. Pirate's Cove is a place for 
younger children that includes many gamcs 
and activities. 

If you're hungry while at the park, there is 
always Chillers, a restaurant with a splendid 
view of the ocean from its sun deck. At night, 
Chil lers heats up with live music and dancing. 

Belmont Park has certainly passed the test 
of time as it has endured 77 years, a few fires 
and a closing. It keeps going strong today and 
looks to be around for years to come. 

T he park, at the inter ection of Mission 
Boulevard and West Mis ion Bay Drive, 
opens at 11 a.m. every day. Closing times are 
seasonal. Call (858) 488-1549 for more infor-
mation.

It's a fun place. I think it would be more fun 
to go clubbing in downtown San Diego, but 
[the clubs) aren't, like, for people who are 18. 

During the daytime I love going to the mall, 
and then during the nighttime, I like going 
downtown. It's fun going downtown and 
hanging out with friends. 

I like to srudy in the lounge because there's 
tons of people and you don't really get much 
done, which is nice. 

I think everyone who wants should get on-
campus housing, and living on campus is part 
of the college experience. 

I don't know. I can speak Marathi tluendy. 

All my goals are nonacademic. It's really sad. 
I guess I want to decide if I'm going to stay at 
UCSD or not. 

At UCSD people are acrually good, but [the 
RSOs) don't have anyone to harass or an}'-
thing, so they take it out on us ... when we are 
really good, srudious people. 

I guess it would be .. . does traveling count? I'd 
love to travel to random places. 

I always thought it would be really fun to ... 
just, like, be an American Indian and see how 
they lived and stuff, before the colonies came. 

Mother Teresa, because then I'd like to know 
how to love people the way she did. 

THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

It's pretty trashy, but it's fun. 

The Comedy Store [in La Jolla) . I work there. 
I do standup, and it's fun to always come in 
and see other standup comedians that come 
through on the weekends and shit. 

I guess around Mandeville, because I'm a music 
major, and that's where all my classes are. 

I'm kind of pissed about the fact that I had no 
chance to get into any dorms or any on-cam-
pus apartments because I'm a transfer. 

Probably Latin because that would make me 
look really smart. 

I'd like to get paid regular at my work, write 
up a contract for doing standup comedy. That 
would be cool. Or, just get laid more. 
I've never really seen 'em treat anybody any 
ways, so I would say I don't know. They seem 
like they're doing a shiny job since I've never 
seen them. 

What I'm doing now, standup comedy and 
music. 

Probably somewhere around the '70s. I liked 
all the art and music and things that come out 
of it, but there was also a lot of bullshit. 

I'd probably choose to be John Travolta from

TJ is kind of a party-groovy thing for coUege stu-
dents to do. It also kind of feels like it vaguely 
exploits the Mexican populace down there. 

On the weekends, currendy I just kick it around 
the beach, go to Blacks and stuff, and hang out 
down there. 

I like to study literature, because that's what I'm 
into. I like reading books, and writing about read-
ing books, and reading about writing about books. 

I'm not too into [the one-rate plan). If I lived on 
campus I'd consider doing a meal plan, but I'd like 
to have the option to do it or not do it as I see 6t. 

I'd have to go with Spanish, just because of my 
proximity, and where I live, and its use . 

One nonacademic goal : I would like -to beat a 
whole lot of video games. 

I haven't had any bad run-ins with the RSOs, 
but I think that sometimes RSOs should light-
en up in just several, like, low-key, kind of 
minor deals that they're pretty rough about. 

I would make movies. I would direct or produce 
or be in movies just for the hell of it. 
I'd rather live in an age where we can travel to 
other planets or maybe interact with other peo-
ple because that would be really nifty.

High-ranking department 
features poor teaching 
By JEFFREY WHITE 
Editor in Chief 

According to the latest "U.S. 
News & World Report" ran1cings, 
UCSD's computer engineering 
program ranks 17th in the nation. 
That's pretty darn good. And as a 
computer engineering ,student, 
I've experienced that goodness 
every day for the last four years. 

The ranking is impressive if 
you think about it. Founded in 
1960, UCSD has rocketed to its 
elite status in barely 40 years. The 
next-youngest college ranked for 
computer engineering is No. 16 
UCLA, founded 60 years earlier 
in 1900. Crazy. 

But what's really crazy is the 
poor teaching in many CE cours-
es at UCSD. Every day, I walk 
into my classes knowing I'm about 
to take a ton of notes about really, 
really hard stuff - but that 's sort 
of the point of college, so no big 
deal. '~ha t i.e a big deal is that half 
the time, professors never clue us 
in to what we 're doing and why 
we're doing it. 

Don 't get me wrong: These 
guys are brilliant. (The fact that 
all of my CE professors have been 
male is another topic.) But for the 
amount of intellect and expertise 
these men possess, most of them 
are shockingly inept at conveying 
that knowledge to anyone with an 
education lower than a doctorate. 

Maybe it's just me, but 'mum-
bling the play-by-play on calculus 
derivations being scrawled on the 
chalkboard for 50 or 80 minutes 
does not constitute teaching, 
especially when the derivations 
being "taught" are presented legi-
bly and error-free in the textbook. 
These professors are not making 
me a good engine.er. 

Of course, there are excep-
tions. A minority of CE instruc-
tors are actually competent at 
expressing their knowledge. They 
are making me a good engineer. 

Exciuding those I have this 
quarter, the best CE professors I 
have had at UCSD are Luigi 

Carro, a visiting professor from 
Brazil who was almost universally 
hated by students because of his 
nasty habit of calling on them and 
forcing active partici pation; and 
Joseph Pasquale, who stubbornly 
refused to give even partial credit 
to studen tS who chose the "inferi-
or" correct answer to a multiple-
choice problem with two correct 
answers on the midterm. 

What sets these guys apart? It's 
simple. Every now and then dur-
ing the course of their lectures, 
they would stop writing on the 
board, face the class and tell us 
what was going on. 

"You see all that garbage I just 
scrawled illegibly on the board? It 

Maybe it's just me, 
but mumbling the 

play-by-play on 
calculus derivations 

being scrawled on 
the chalkboard for 
50 to 80 minutes 

does not constitute 
teaching, especially 

when the deri vations 
being 'taught' are 

presented legibly and 
error-free in the 

textbook. 

shows how to calculate the power 
dissipated in a modern transistor. 
You know why that's important? 
Because it means the difference 
between plugging your computer 
into the wall and plugging your 
computer into a dedicated tur-
bine-driven "ower plant." 

At that point, the differential 
equations and integrals cease to 
just be numbers and Greek sym-
bols. At that point, they become 
meaningful, learnable knowledge. 
I'm not stupid, but I do need to be 
deliberately told - even remind-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

ed every now and then - about 
why computer engineers need to 
know these equations and how we 
will use them in our careers. 

Back to the CE program's high 
ran1cing. I can interpret it several 
ways. One way would be that 
"U.S. News & World Report" is 
run by a bunch of dolts, and our 
program is not nearly as good as 
they think. Yeah, I don't like that 
one either. Another would be that 
computer engineering is taught 
like this nationwide, and that only 
16 schools do it better. That's just 
too frightening and depressing for 
me to accept. 

What I would like to believe is 
that UCSD's CE department is a 
sleeping giant. Having sat 
through plenty of CE classes, it is 
quite obvious to me that UCSD's 
faculty is full of computer and 
el.ectrical · engineers who have 
almost superhuman mastery of 
their fields. Most of them can go 
through a lecture and derive 
astonishingly complex concepts 
without referring to their notes 
more than a couple times. 
Frankly, it's sort of scary to watch. 

The problem is that these 
important concepts are trapped in 
their brains, and the only way 
most of them know to communi-
cate such information is through 
equations and derivations. 
Granted, that's the only way to 
express certain mathematical and 
scientific concepts, but every 
equation should be accompanied 
by an explanation if that equation 
is supposed to mean something to 
me. 

If UCSD is interested in 
improving its No. 17 ran1cing 
among CE programs, I believe it 
should look first to its professors. 
If they would turn their backs to 
the chalkboard instead of just to 
the students, I think UCLA would 
be eating our dust in no time. It's 
got to be the simplest and cheap-
est way to instantly improve the 
quality of education at our ambi-
tious and already impressive engi-
neering institution. 

We're not like every 
other high-tech company. 

We're hiring. 

No one told you the hardest part of being an engineer would be finding 
your first job. Of course, it's still possible to get the high-tech work 
you want by joining the U.S. Air Force. You can leverage your degree 
immediately and get hands-on experience with some of the most 
sophisticated technology on earth. To find out how to get your career off 
the ground, call 1-800-423-USAF or visit our Web site at alrforce.com.

Women's basketball 
drops two on the road 
Poor shooting, strong Bronco 
defense cause Tritons to fall to 9-11 
By OWEN MAIN 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team went into this weekend's pair 
of road games knowing it had two 
rough games ahead. Little did the 
ream know just how tough the road 
1V0uid prove to be. 

Friday night the Triton~ trav-
ded to San Bernardino, where they 
met the California State University 
San Bernardino Coyotes. The 
IJdics from San Bernardino were 
looking to avenge a 54-47 loss to 
UCSD at RIMAC Arena that had 
occurred earlier in the season. 

UCSD started the game focused 
on defense, but it neglected to 
bring its shooting touch to the 
court. The TritOns held the 
Coyotes to 26 percent from the 
field in the first half, but only shot 
30 percent themselves and trailed 
21-25 at halftime. 

"Shooting killed us," said 
UCSD head coach Judy Malone. 
"We were getting good shots, but 
we just weren't hitting them." 

The second half found UCSD 
in foul trouble, and the Coyotes' 
Sharee Brown made them pay 
from the charity stripe, where she 
shot nine out of 12 for the game. 
Brown finished with 19 points. As 
a team, the Tritons only made 10 
out of 2 I f,.ee throws for the 
game. 

However, the TritOns didn't 
give up. Ali Ginn led the Triton 
comeback effort, finishing with a 
game-high 21 points on 4-6 three- · 
point shooting. But the balanced 
San Bernardino scoring attack and 
a 28-7 edge in bench scoring 
made the difference and the 
Tritons fell 63 -51. 

Guard Nicholle BromJey over-
ca me a poor shooting night to con-
Iri/lLlte nine rebounds, and center 
l\lurgaretJohnson added 10 points 
:lnd six rebounds. Danyie l 
\Vortham chipped in with seven 
poi nts and four rebounds . 

On Saturday, UCSD looked to 

bounce back from Friday's defeat. 
Standing in its way was second-
ranked California Collegiate 
Athletic Association powerhouse 
Cal Poly Pomona. 

After narrowly escaping a 
RIMAC Arena upset earlier in the 
year, Cal Poly Pomona solidified 
itself as a dominant team, never 
trailing the Tritons and doubling 
UCSD's score at halftime 54-27. 

The Tritons were hobbled by an 
injury to leading scorer Ginn. 

"Ali Ginn hurt her knee in the 
first few minutes," Malone said. 

Before Ginn could get to the 
bench, the rout had begun. 

"Pomona pressed all game," 
Malone said. "They are very athlet-
ic and aggressive," 

The Broncos defense forced 31 
Triton turnovers and fru strated 
UCSD all night. 

With the game's outcome cer-
tain and Ginn's injury, some 
Tritons got a little more playing 
time than usual. 

"Laura Sargent had a good 
game," said Malone, who was 
encouraged by the Tritons' bench 
play. "Stacy [Gallagher-Bolton] has 
also been playing very well lately." 

Karina Siam led UCSD, scoring 
with 11 points off the bench. 
Gallagher-Bolton finished with 10 
points and four rebounds. 

Pomona, which didn't stop its 
full-court press, led by as many as 
40 points and ended the game 96-
57. 

The win put Pomona in a first-
place tie with Cal State Bakersfield 
and dropped UCSD to 9-11 in 
conference play and 13-12 overall . 

"It was a lousy weekend," 
Malone said , summing up the feel-
ings of disappointment for UCSD. 

This weekend, the Tritons look 
to bounce back in their last CCAA 
homestand before ending the sea-
son on the road . The UC Davis 
Aggies come to town Friday nig ht, 
followed by the Chico State 
Wildcats on Saturday night. Both 
g:tmes tip off at 5:30 p.m.

Angeles this weekend. The women's 
team finished first and the men's 
team took second in their first inter-
collegiatc competition of the season. 

The UCSD women's team won 
the team title with 159 points, dis-
tanci ng itself from runner-up 

. California State University Los 
Angeles, which finished with 115. 
Cal Poly Pomona, Cal State 
Dominguez Hills and Sonoma 
State finished in that order, round-
ing out the field. 

On the track, three Tritons 
emerged victorious - Audrey Sung 
in the 3,OOO-meter run, Meredith 
Perry in the lOO-meter hurdles and 
Hillary Hills in the 400-meter hur-
dles. Perry' mark of 14.2 in the hur-
dles broke the UCSD record of 
14.29 set by Lisa Shepard in 1995. 

UCSD fared even bener in field 
events, with Clara Wilson winning 
the long jump, Zit:! Dixon taking the 
high jump, Jackie Vu earning fim in 
the pole vault, Sara A1lsur winning 
the discus and Sagrario Hernandez 

taking first in the shot put. 
On the men's side, Cal Poly 

Pomona took first with 170 points, 
the Tritons finishing second with 
149 and CSULA last with 38. 

UCSD won eight events -
including the 100-meter relay and 
400-meter relay. Individually, Jon 
Wong took first in the 800 meters 
and 1500 meters, Brian Parisi won . 
the 400 meters and Julian Nahan 
won the 3,OOO-meter steeplechase. 
On the field, Rob Ewanio won both 
the hammer throw and shot put. 

Although NCAA qualifications 
do not begin until March I, UCSD 
had several performances that 
would have earned athletes provi-
sional spots or would have come 
close to qualifying at the NCAA 
Division II Championships in San 
Angelo, Texas. 

Ewanio, the UCSD record-
holder in the shot put, had a mark of 
56'10" in the men s shot put that was 
just shy of the 58'6" needed for an 
automatic berth. Wong's 3:56.9 in 
the men 5 1500 meters was just off of 
the 3:55 mark required for a provi -
sional bid to the NCAA. 

Perry's 14.2 in the womens 100-
meter hurdles would have surpassed 
the 14.65 needed for a provisional 
qualifying berth and was close to the 
13.8 required for an automatic spot.

Tritons sweep CCAA foe Stanislaus, split with Western New Mexico 
By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD softball team 
picked up a pair of league wins 
against California State University 
Stanislaus before splitting a dou -
bleheader with Western New 
Mexico University over the week-
end. Defense proved to be key, 
helping the Tritons improve to 14-
2 overall and 7 -I in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 

Friday's first game with the 
Warriors of Stanislaus started well 
for the Tritons - they scored two 
runs in the first inning. A weak 
throw from the left fielder was 
unable to gun down Ki m Aggabao 
when she scored from second on a 
two-out single by Leea Harlan. 
The Tritons added another 
unearned run in the first to lead 
2-0. 

The Warriors came back in the 
top of the third inning to score a 
single run but could not sustain the 
rall y, str3 ndi ng two runners on 
base. After the early offense, the 
g:t me settled into a rhythm, ,vi th 
nei ther side able to mount a seri-
ous threat. Harlan was strong on 
the mound for UCSD, allowing 
only four hits and one run while 
striking out IOta go the distance 
for the 2- 1 victory. 

Game two opened with the 
TritOns showing a new facet of their 
offense, stealing three bases during 
a three-nm first inning. Micka 
McCue's two-out, two-run double 
was the big blow of the inning, 
bringing in Harlan and Christi 
Martinelli . The second inning 
brought more of the same, with 
UCSD scoring another three runs 
\vith the help of three stolen bases

UCSF, U Penn 

and a big two-out, two-run double, 
this time by Kristina Anderson. 

Head coach Patti Gerckens 
stressed that her club is looking to 
take advantage of opportunities 
on the bases. 

"We want to be more aggressive 
than ever this year," she said. "We 
wam to keep other teams guessing." 

On the mound, Martinelli had 
the Warrior batters guessing all day, 
surrendering only three hits and 
onc run ovcr six innings. With a 
two-run single by Anderson in the 
bottom of the sixth, the lntons 
took an 8-1 iead into the final 
inning. Freshman pitcher Keri 
Hanley came in to try to close 
things out, but the Warriors 
roughed her up for twO runs and 
three hits in two-thirds of an inning 
before Martinelli returned to get 
the final out and seal the 8-3 win. 

UCSD's Anderson, who paced 
the offense with four RBis, com-
mented afterward on her produc-
tion. 

"I'm just trying to help my team 
out," she said. "We're trying to 
score one run at a time, and more 
importantly, score throughout the 
game to support our pitchers." 

Support would be crucial in 
Saturday's first game against 
Western New Mexico, when 
pitcher Angela Slaugh came in 
fresh off a perfect game last week. 
Slaugh wasn't perfect, but she was 
good enough, allowing only one 
run . The Lady Mustangs found 
their offensive stride in the fourth 
inning when they scored two runs 
off Harlan, but they were unable 
to make a big inning into a huge 
one when they left the bascs 
loaded. The Tritons battled back 
for a single run in the fifth but

Heavy hitters: A Triton hitter takes a cut earlier this year. UCSD's offense 
erupted for 17 runs in four games last weekend to help the Tritons improve to 14-2. 

Western New Mexico responded 
with another run in the sixth. 

Heading into the seventh 
inning, the Tritons trailed 3 -I and 
looked to get a rally started when 
everythin g fell a part. 

"We were taking the little 
things for granted," Martinelli said. 
"We didn't make routine plays we 
know how to make, and our com-

munication was definitely lacking." 
The Tritons, who entered the 

weekend leading the CCAA in 
fielding percentage, committed 
two errors, a passed ball and Sf!V-
eral mental mistakes leading to a 
nightmarish inning in which the 
Lady Mustangs scored four times

the women. n 

Individually the women were

Tritons victorious over nonconference foe Mercyhu rst College 
By TAIT MILLER 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
team, piloted by third-year coach 
Ron Larsen, beat Mercyhurst 
College in four games in noncon-
ference play Sanrrday evening at 
RIMAC Arena. 

UCSD came out strong with a 
30-15 win in the first game, deny-
ing Mercyhurst any openings on 
ei ther side of the net. 

The Tritons came into the 
night sporting a seven-match los-
ing streak and a 1- 12 record . Their 
last win wasJan. 30 against a squad 
from Princeton University. 

It was not a tough night for the 
Tritons. Mercyhur~t, a small 
Division II college from Erie, Pa., 
had a 2 -7 record and was looking 
to make up for it with a win 
against the TritOns. 

In the second game, UCSD 
was plagued by mistakes and lost 
28-30. Mounting a late-game 
charge, the Tritons tried to come 
back and take game two from the 
Lakers, but failed . 

Between games two and three, 
there was a serving competition. 
David Hornson won, getting a $25 
gift certificate for his effort. 

In the third game, the Tritons 
jumped out to an early lead. The 

Lakers had some early trouble, but 
soon began to gnaw at UCSD's lead. 

With UCSD leading 26-24, 
Mercyhurst had momennrm and 
began dosing in on UCSD. The 
Lakers were looking to eke out 
another win. 

Then UCSD's Jim Waller and 
Eric Perrine took the game over 
for the Tritons. 

Perrine took the Tritons to 27-
24 with one of his 15 kills that 
night. At 27-24, Waller served a 
twister to the Lakers and when 
they could not manage a side out, 
gave UCSD the point from the 
other side with a kill . 

Perrine then had a stellar 
block for 29-24 and Waller fin-
ished off the game with a service 
ace that ricocheted into the back-
court. 

Waller is ranked 17th in the 
nation in kill average at 4 .03 per 
game. Against Mercyhurst, he had 
23 kills at a .633 rate compared to 
his season rate of .246, which also 
leads the team. 

The Tritons improved upon 
their previous outing against the 
University of Southern California. 
They hit .172 against the Trojans, 
while against the Eri'e team they 
collectively hit .460. 

Perrine added 10 digs against 
the Lakers and leads the team for

Baseball hangs tough with SDSU Two wins 
for men's 
tennis 

Tritons drop 3 -0 to Div. I Aztecs, beat La Verne 13-1 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

The Triton baseball team 
returned home to face the 
University of La Verne in a non-
conference match Feb. 23 after a 
3 -0 road loss to Division I San 
Diego State University on 
Wednesday night. 

In the SDSU matchup, 
UCSD pitcher John Beaven 
pitched a perfect game for 4.1 
innings, but Aztec first baseman 
Jonathan Stephens broke up the 
no-hitter with a one-out single in 
the fifth , and SDSU proceeded 
to score three times in the sixth 
to win. 

Saturday'S game against La 
Verne saw an end to the Tritons' 
three-game losing streak. 

UCSD's hitting slump came 
to an end during this game, with 
all nine Triton starters accumu-
lating at least one hit each against 
the University of La Verne. 

With the teams tied at one 

run apiece in the bottom of the 
second inning, UCSD put 
together a one-out, eight-run 
rally and never looked back. 

With the bases loaded in the 
second inning, Triton Nigel Miller 
smacked a line drive double to left 
field and drove in three runs to ini-
tiate the UCSD offensive attack. 
Immediately after that, Triton left 
fielder John Bologna rocketed a 
triple to the fence in center field 
and drove in another run. 

Triton designated hitter Brett 
Burton, who went 3-for-3 on the 
day with three runs, was hit by a 
pitch, and then center fielder 
Matt Smith singled to right, 
scoring Bologna on the play .. 
Smith drove in three runs on 
three hits for UCSD. 

Still in the second, with run-
ners on first and second, UCSD 
catcher Jeff Riddle proceeded to 
knock a three-run home run over 
the right field fence. The five hits 
and eight runs in the second 
inning put the Tritons in the dri-

ver's seat for the rest of the game. 
UCSD's Bologna, who drove 

in two runs, scored three times in 
the game. He started off the sixth 
with a solo shot to left center 
field . Then, with two outs, 
Triton third baseman Ryan 
Larson doubled, followed by a 
single from first baseman Chad 
Addison to drive in two addition-
al runs and add an insult to injury 
against the Leopards. 

"The eight-run inning in the 
second just goes to show that we 
can put a lot of runs on the board 
at any given time," Addison s,ud. 

UCSD starting pitcher Keith 
Smith went five innings with jwst 
two hits, one run, three strike-
outs and two batters who were 
hit. He improves to 3-2 on the 
season. Raf Bergstrom, Robert 
Bush and Tyler Smith also 
pitched during the Triton victory 
Saturday. 

With the 13 -run, 16-hit victo-
ry, the Tritons improve to 9-8-1, 
while the Leopards fall to 5-3 on 
the year. 

"Today's game was good for 
the team because it is always nice 
to have the offense and the defense 
on the same page," Addison said. 
"Originally, we didn't have the 

gam~ on the schedule, but it was a 
great addition to allow the offense 
to get back into the swing of 
things. We are a very tough team 
to beat when our pitching and 
offense are working together." 

UCSD next squares off 
against 1Pth-ranked California 
State University San Bernardino 
in a four-game conference series 
this weekend starting with a 
game Thursday at Cal State San 
Bernardino.
