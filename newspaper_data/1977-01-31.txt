UCSD GPA Steady Stud,ent Regent Applications 
Are Now' Being Accepted 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Writer 

Hull Sees Grades Losing Value 
"I've benefited tremendously," claimed Daryn Peeples of her post as 

Student Regent for the 1976-1977 school year. Applications for the 1977-78 
position, which involved "tremendous responsibilities," are being ac-
cepted through Feb. 11 by the University of California Student Lobby. 

Applications for the position are available in the Office of Student 
Affairs, located in the Student Center. 

"There is only one student member of the Board of Regents. This 
person will always have the unique responsibility of representing 
divergent student views, while also being a trustee of the State of 
California," said Peeples. She has sacrificed study time in order to 
gather student input and to keep office hours that make her avaitable to 
UC students. 

Bob Moore, UC Student Lobby Intern, and Jon Haber, lobby co-
Director, stress that "the Student Regent must be willing to develop -a 
working knowledge of the University issues, such as financial aid, the 
budget, quality and content of undergraduate and graduate education." 
One must also be willing "to devote the necessary time for the position, 
while being a student in good standing." 

Screening Applicants 
The process of screening applicants from the UCSD campus will in-

volve an interview with the Southern Regional Nominating Committee at 
UCLA for those persons whose applications have passed a preliminary 
viewing by the Conunittee. 

The Student Body President's Council will then interview five ap-
plicants from the south and four from the north, of which three will finally 
be screened by the Board of Regents. While Peeples found applying for 
the position "traumatic," she was thrilled at finally being chosen and 
feels that "it was all worth it." 

"The qualifications for the position are flexible, but you should have a 
general knowledge of how the University operates and perhaps one 
systemwide interest like affirmative action or registration fees," says 
Peeples. "However, self-motivation, determination and awareness can 
always make up for a lack of information on specific issues." 

Peeples' background includes serving as chairperson of the Student 
Advisory Commitf.ee to the Offtce of AdJ;ni ions and RecQrqs an<i a~ 
member of the Registration Fee Committee. It was through her job with 
the Public Information Office that she first began her interest in inter-
campus student government. She said her present position is a result of 
her own active involvement at the UC Berkeley campus. 

Peeples sees the post as being "time-consuming and perhaps 
frustrating, but also very rewarding. The experience gained from serving 
one year as a Regent could not be duplicated in a lifetime." 

Exchange Students Compare Schools 

by Wesley Wada 
Staff Writer 

During the Vietnam War era, 
non-economic type of inflation 
began to emerge. Student grade 
point . averages began to rise. A 
1964 survey, conducted by Arvo 
Juola, a Michigan State University 
professor, polled 135 colleges and 
universities across the country. 
The survey indicated that the 
average G PA among those in-
stitutions polled was 2.44. In 10 
years, the average GPA rose to 
2.77. 

At UCSD, the seniors' spring 
cumulative GPA for 1967 was 2.645. 
In 1970, the GPA jumped to 2.980. 
Current UCSD grade statistics 
would not be released by the 
registrar's office. 

During this same period the 
average GPAs of enterigg classes 
of graduate schools also began to 
rise. In 1967, Boalt Hall law school 
of UC Berkeley, admitted a class 
with an average GPA of 3.42. The 
entering class of 1976 carried a 3.60 
GPA. 

One person who is not surprised 
by thilt upward trend is Tom Hull, 
Assistant to the Vice-chancellor of 
Academic Affairs. 

Best Swdent Ever 
"We are getting the best students 

we've ever had," explained Hull. 
"The students are better 
prepared. " 

In reference to graduate schools, 
Hull explains, "you have a great 
deal with Boalt Hall. There are 

Dartmouth Rowdy; UCSD Friendly 
by Lisa Frankel 

Staff Writer 

" It is a small school, but there 
are those who love it," stated 
Daniel Webster in 1823 about 
Dartmouth College. 

According to six Dartmouth 
students, part of the sixteen 

students participating in the 
specia l Muir-Dartmouth 
student exchange program this 
quarter at uam, this quote still 
reigns true today as they 
compared and contrasted UCSD 
with their home school. 

"Life at Dartmouth is never 
boring! " stated Karl Hart-

mann, senior. Each interviewed 
exchange student agrees that 
the Dartmouth students are 
much rowdier and spirited than 
the UCSD students. SiRce 90 
percent of the students at 
Dartmouth live on campus in 
the small and isolated town of 
Hanover, Massachusetts, 
student social life tends to 
center almost exclusively 
around the campus. 

Frederic Vorys, sophomore, 
stated that "at Dartmouth there 
is no nearby town, such as Del 
Mar, and students stay at school 
to party. If there is a party at 
Dartmouth, everyone knows 
about it." 

Strong Social Life 

The exchange students ex-
press that unlike at UCSD, the 
social life at Dartmouth is 
centered around the 22 college 
fraternities. Sponsoring many 
social functions, the fraterniUes 
are often competitive and 
contribute to much of the school 
spirit. 

The inter-collegiate football 
and hockey teams at Dartmouth 
further enhance school spirit 
and loyalty. Also, contrary to 

U~D, the school carries the 
traditional pride that has 
developed in the over ISO years 
It has been established. 

Continued OD baek pale 

many California students who 
would like to stay in California. 
Berkeley is rated the seventh best 
law school in the nation and ex-
penses are about $670 (per school 
year). Berkeley could have filled 
its class with 4.0s if they wanted 
to." 

This does not mean, Hull em-
phasized, that he believes grade 
inflation is a non-existant problem 
in our educational institutions. 

"Grades are losing their value," 
confided Hull. "Graduate schools 
must fall back on MCATs and 
LSATs (for their evaluations of 
students)." 

Pass Not Pass 
The PasslNot Pass system is 

considered to be a major con-
tributor to grade inflation. 
Students interested in attaining 
high GPAs utilize this option when 
taking difficult courses, thus 
avoiding the possibility of a 
mediocre grade. 

However, according to Rena 
Reno, program representative and 
Advisor for Third College, students 
are abusing this privilege. Reno 
explained that students taking a 
class with the Pass/Not Pass 
option sometimes find that after 
well into the quarter they have an 
"A" in the course. Even though the 
deadline for changing the option is 
long past, students try to change 
their status in the class. Often they 
are successful. 

" Students can petition 
anything," commented Reno. 

The upward trend of grades, 

however, seems to be stabilizing. 
The 1974 figure of 2.77 for the 135 
colleges across the nation 
represented a peak according to 
Juola's survey. In his 1975 survey, 
a drop to 2.74 was recorded. Juola 
remarked that " it is !>ignificant 
that this decrease ... represents a 
marked change from the pattern of 
successive increases since 1965 and

perhaps since 1960." 
UCSD's seniors' spring 

cumulative GPA also appears to 
have 1 veled off. ince 1970, when 
the GPA was 2.980, the change has 
been minimal. In 1975, the senior's 
GPA was 2.974. 

The Faculty are "clamping 
down" on grades according to 
Reno. She added that easy graders 
are a "minority" on campus. 

MIT Nuclear Ph),sicist Warns 
Against Arms Proliferation 

by Dorothy Houston 
Staff Writer 

"Unless we bring the nuclear arms race under control, we are insuril)g 
the disappearance of the human race," warned Bernard Feld, professor 
of physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and editor of the 
Bulletin for Atomic Scientists. Feld startled UCSD students with other 
similar and disturbing statements in a lecture entitled "Nuclear Power 
and Nuclear Proliferation" last Thursday evening. 

Beginning the talk by discussing a possible nuclear confrontation 
between the superpowers of the US and the USSR, Feld said, "We're 
reaching the stage where damage could be completely devastating. We 
have a few thousand inter-continental missiles, each the equivalent of a 
million tons of TNT." This compares with the bomb that fell on 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, each carrying the equivalent of 15 to 20 
thousand tons of TNT. 

"Even a constained nuclear war would result in hundreds of millions of 
casualties, with 80 to 90 per cent of all industry being wiped out," said 
Feld. " Naturally, the radioactivity and ozone depletion would be 
widespread. " 

A " Det rreDt Effect" 
Feld stated that there exists a "deterrent effect" where " no Russian 

leader in his right mind (knowing the nuclear capacity of the U.S.) would 
order the US to be bombed." Feeling that we can greatly reduce our arms 
supply and still uphold this "deterent effect," Feld said, " You don't have 
to trust the Rus ians to have arms limitation. Our potential for over kill i 
tremendous, we've got to take a large step and get on the path towards 
limitation. " 

Feld feels that the Strategic Arms Limitation talks have failed to 
control the nuclear problem because when " limitation agreements are 
finally worked out they are nullified because of the new types of 
weaponry constantly being developed." 

" We're running the arms race; we d,vl~lop th ne weapons and 
Russia follows," said Feld. He further stated that the w ucb a

Commentary 
An . Essay on Student Power 

by ADdy Scluaelder 
Studest RIP" TMk Force 

In I~ diverse student groups across the UC 
Berkeley campus coalesced to fonn the Free Speech 
movement. Radical, liberal, and conservative ac-
tivists joined to center their organization around a 
fight with the administration over the right to 
political advocacy. 

At that time, any activity faintly connected with the 
organizing, fund raising, speaking on behalf, or 
recruiting for political causes was banned from 
campus. The rule was enforced with a threat of ex-
pulsion. BatUelines for the struggle were drawn over 
a small strip of land at Bancroft and Telegraph Way 
'.hrough which hwulreds of students entered each d3y 
on their way to classes and the adjacent student 
center. 

This area was used by student leaders to hand out 
leaflets, to raise money for freedom fighters on their 
way south, and to recruit protestors for strikes aimed 
at community business interests, The administration 
called it a 'safety pressure valve ', looked the other 
way, and ordered that the property should be sold to 
the city until ... students organized a protest against 
the politics of Barry GO.ldwater and picketed the 
Republican National Convention. 

The University has a special constitutional status 
which makes its operation independent from state 
goverrunent intervention. Fearing that student 
political activity would be a threat to this relation-
ship, the University clamped down hard. I,t moved to 
shut down the efforts of activists at Bancroft and 
Telegrllph Way. 

Continual failure to meet student demands for the 
right to political advocacy resulted in a take over of 
administration buildings, creation of a 'free 
university' and a sudden stop to the operation of the 
institution. 

With the blessing of the Governor and the 
assistance of a batallion of state troopers a rmed with 
riot gear, the administration retaliated by ordering 
student removal. Violence and bloodshed cleared 
Sproul Hall, but other students acutely aware of the 
situation would rW} a boycott to effectively close the 
teaching and research function of Berkeley. 

. Administrative power and control was overthrown. 
The Academic Senate voted to honor the demands of 

~~~. . 
Why did student leaders willingly accept expulsi~ 

rather than compromise political stands? What 
caused students to fight the power of the ad-
ministration to the point of physical struggle and jail? 
And most important, why were thousands of students 
willing to protest in the classroom and boycott the 
classroom? 

The battle over the right to free speech escalated 
into a concentration of students with the strength in 
supportive numbers to freely question the social 
values which legitimized the operation of the 
University. Students condemned the tradition of 
elitist influence in University development. Students 
opposed the selling of the -University to a corporate 
and military world which determined t1Je purpose of 
academic programs by its power to fund. Students 
were torn between personal committment to moral 
values and the pressure to fit right molds for a job. 

The false innocence of existence in an academic 
sanctuary was chaUenged by the knowledge of the 
bombs, race riots, and social poverty in the real 
world. This isolation was matched with an im-
personal institution which appeared to represent a 
repressed reality and a lack of response to SOCial 
need. . 

The acts of the administration were not the cause 
but set the environment for the struggle. Bennett 
Berger's LqokiDg for America suggests that 
" ... student unrest was not invented by outside 
agitators, that Its source is in sOcial conditions 
conservatives affirm, and that it is not repressible 
short of military measure." 

Students closed the University. The demand was 
clear and it was worth bloodshed. The University was 
forced to adapt or face Wlcertain death. The Berkeley 
experience sparked similar student strikes across the

molds for a job . 

nation. In the wake of this movement, the University 
chose to adapt...but, on a superficial level. 

This University attempt to placate pressure 
created an orgy of relevant courses and student 
participation. Special alternative learning projects 
were recognized. Academic programs focused on 
social need. Students were appointed to advise dozens 
of acad9fllic senate and administrative committees. 

'. As the years passed the student population changed 
with a new generation, but the faculty and the ad-
ministration stayed. Student leaders burned out, 
student organizations dispersed, pnd administrators 
continued to maintain the bureaucracy . The fun-
damental gains of the Free Speech Movement slowly 
eroded. Students still sit on campus-wide committees 
in large numbers, but what do they decide? 

Not much. . . 
Students are observers, perspective-givers or 

judged unable to represent a consensus of the student 
body: They are not equal .active factors in the 
decision-making process. Experimental projects, 
alternative programs, and relevant academic a~ 
proaches to social need remain in the fonn of 
rhetoric. These purposes have been recycled and the 
remnants have been retreaded into traditional 
departmental discipline. 

Where does that leave the students of the 70's? 
Nowhere, powerless, and window dressing for 
decisions made by the University bureaucracy. What 
have we learned? The time is coming when we will 
begin again. It is absolutely crucial to build a student 
organization strong enough to socialize new students, 
pass down advancements to new generations, 
educate with past experience, and recruit fresh in-
volvement; fluid enough to avoid our own 
bureaucracy and flexible enough to allow change. 

I don't think that the answer is to overthrow power 
and take total responsibility for control. The most

Bullins DepictsÂ· Ghetto Life 
by Ted NavlD Barke 

stall Writer 
"I was the one in the gang who 

wrote down the words of street 
corner songs," said acclaimed 
black playwrite Ed Bullins. "Be~g 
a writer in myoid PhiladelphIa 
neighborhood was almost un-
thinkable. One either got a job that 
they'd keep the rest of their lives, 

joined the army, hustled, or went 
to jail. Writing was thought to be 
effete, and blacks who wanted to be 
writers were denigrated for trying 
to be white. "

seminar in the Mandeville Recital 
Hall. He spoke on his development 
as a play write , black literature in 
the Sixties, and his primary con-
cerns in subject matter. 

Born in 1935, Bullins began 
writing prose pieces for small 
magazines in the 50's, doing what 
he termed " personal" writing, 
evolving to protest material, which 
he later abandoned for the theater. 

" I became, in a sense, a public 
writer with the theater," he said, 
" because theater is a community 
art. With the advent of the Sixties, 
there were other black writers like 
myself who were ready to cast 
aside the self consciousness of 
experimentation and speak 
directly of what we knew. I had, for 
years, lived with the lowest caste 
of urban life in American culture, 
and since I knew these things best, 
.I sought to use these people as full 
blown dramatic characters. 1 
wanted to write scripts from their 
point of view. 

For example, 1 wrote a story 
called The Reluctant Rapist, in 
which I sought to get inside the 
psyche of the rapist. Friends ask 
me why I've concentrated on the 
lower depths of society, and I 
answer that I have broken hread 
too many times with these folks to 
ignore them. They need a voice, a 
voice to show everyone else what 
the underbelly of American culture 
is like. These things need exposure. 
They're just as much a part of the 
American makeÂ· up as anything 
else." 

He went on to say that he had no 
idea of what direction black 
writers will take in the future. He 
said that he was glad that black 
literature is more respectable 
today than it was just a few years 
ago, but bemoaned the growing 
banality of subject matter and 
treatment, citing Alex Haley's 
Roots as an example. 

The Taking of Miss Janie, 
directed by Luther James, will be

beginning Feb. 3, with per-

Student Power ... 
[Continued from page 2] 

viable strategy would be to use 
power to influence and to gain the 
right of mutual respect with equal 
partiCipation in decision-making. 
We should support ourselves not by 
the energy of a single strike, but 
with the strength of responsible 
participation. Administrative 
positions should be countered with 
opposing research, not rhetoric. 
Administrative proposals should 
be countered with vlable alter-
natives, not undefined accusations. 

And then student power will have 
the weight of the masseS willing to 
put the pressure of numbers behind 
plans, not cosmic statements. 
Berkeley students proved the 
University can be temporarily 
overthrown from within. Real 
change in the University can only 
be accomplished when you com-
bine internal movements with 
external pressures. Researched 
goa l oriented objectives and 
proposals can find a much larger 
influential .base in the community 
as a change agent. 

When will It happen? Maybe a 
start to build a base to grow from 
could be found in the upcoming 
refe rendum. Choose to 9articlpate.

What's 
Up?

Dr. Littleman 
THANKS, FOR THE QUESTIONS 

Dear Doc: Why is It that the girls 
at UCSD [or anywhere else for that 
matter,] go after males ofthe older 
persuasion? U chJcks live longer 
thu guys, shouldn't they go for the 
newer mode .. ? - a F'nIstrated 
Freshman 

Dear Frustrated: I don't think 
age alone Is the necessary 
determining factor . Although 
women generally live longer than 
men, they also mature at a much 
earlier age. Therefore, for a 
woman to find a man at the same 
maturity level as she, she 
frequently will find him among the 

"older persuasion." Besides, a 
man doesn't really hit his prime 
until he is 22. If you don't get 
discouraged, and clean up your 
chauvinism, you'll stand a better 
changp. with women as time goes . 
by . 

Dear Doc: Is it true that Triton 
Times Executive Editor Dave 
Ei en sleep in the nude with his 
Teddy Bear which he named 
Darleen? If so, what are the 
psychological ramifications of 
such an action in terms of the 
ed itorial content of the Trilon 
Time? 

This is a vicious rlUDor that has 
been started by our production 
department. His Teddy Bear's 
name is Cindy, although Eisen has 
little , if any , impact upon the 
Triton Times editorial policy, the 
Teddy Bear absolutely dictates 
what we say. Isn't it obvious?' 

Dear Doc: Is it true that UCSD 
students who drive to school and 
back won't pick up other UC D 
tudenl who are bitch-biking 

because 
a ] They' re afraid tho e who are 

hitch-hiking will get 10 their 
destination fir t, thus enabling 
them to have more study time? 

b) Of their conservative up-
bringing? 

c) General batred of other UCSO 
students? 

d ) Not being able to locate the 
person who might rape them OB 
one of the campuse ? 

e l The general selfl h , 
egoti tical nature of modern

Swim Team 
Splashes 
To Victory 

by Jeff Nomura 
StaHWriter 

The UCSD swim team turned 
back a visiting squad from 
Ambassador 'College last Thursday 
afternoon with a convincing 7fr37 
victory. 

A high degree of depth and 
quality was displayed as the 
Tritons swept the 50 yard freestyle 
and 200 yard backstroke and won 
all the relays. 

A strong performance was 
turned in by Mark Allen, who 
placed in the 200 yard backstroke 
and won the 200 yard individual 
medley with 8 2:08.1, close to a 
national qualifying time. 

Guy BuCcaMan displayed his 
fine ability in the free style, win-
ning the events at both 50 and 100 
yards. 

Anchoring the 400 yard rel1ly 
team, Dave Tamura sparked his 
teammates with a 52 second effort. 

Bob Owsley cracked the one-
minute barrier in the 100 yard 
butterfly, as he placed in a fine 59,5 
clocking, 

I;We really had a good time," 
commented coach Gary Becker, 
"and overall our times have 
dropped." 

Over the weekend, the visiting 
Tritons travelled to Nevada to 
compete with the University of Las 
Vegas. 

UCSD women's basketball team 
gained another lIiclory Friday 
against Whittier , 41 Â·32, In the

"The drinking age there is 1'. and the beer lEep flow freely." stated 
Hartmann. Each lnterviewed Dar1lJlouth student agreed there is a 
greater amooot of drinking at tbeir school. Cocktail parties often occw- at 
Dartmouth, and local student t)Ubs are popular. However, the students 
agree marijuana is much mort prevalent at UCSD. According to John 
Marshall, sophomore, "Pot is smoked behind closed doors at Dart-
mouth." 

The exchange students felt Dartmouth is more "intense" and 
scJ'lolastically competitive. The school runs on a year-round four quarter 
system, and the normal load is three 5-unit courses. "The instructors at 
Dartmouth are generally closer to the students," expressed JoaMa 
Aldrich, Linda BaMon, and Nancy Jackson, Dartmouth seniors. "The 
sections, as well as the lectures, are taught by the professors." 

Also, they said, since Dartmouth has half the student enrollment as at 
UCSD, the classes tend to be 1I1l81ler, and it is-easier to receive more 
individualized attention. Many of the Dartmouth students have found the 
UCSD bureaucracy to be very difficult to cope with at times. "The 
communication between departments is often lacklng," stated Hart-
mrum. .

degrees F. Vorys found there is much greater mobility of studentsÂ· at 
UCSD where the weather is warmer.

.place to place in sub-zero tem-

The interviewed Dartmouth 
exchange students have generally 
found UCSD to be a great ex-
perience so far. Bannon, Jackson, 
and Aldrich have fOood the courses 
at ucsb to be .to their liking and 
the students very friendly. 

Yet the strong sense of Dart-
mouth prive prevails within each 
Dartmouth student. Bannon ex-
pressed the sentiment that "when 
you are a student at Dartmouth, 
you are a student for life."
