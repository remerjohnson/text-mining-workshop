Voluntary fee riding 
a 'libertarian wave' 
Editor: 

There has been a "libertar, 
ian wa\e" gomg through 
campu,> that has hit upon th 
AS Council and the mandaton' 
pa\,ment of Acti\lt\ fees 
These students claim that 
ritizens should have the choice 
of whet her or not to pal thIs 
" tax ," Furt hermorr, if 
student<: choose to pay the $8 
fee, the) should ha\'c a chOIce 
in '" here the funds are 
directed One can understand 
that students would like to 
have input over the expendi-
ture of these monies. For that 
reason, many students would 
favor optional payment, not 
recogni7ing the realistiC and 
practical implications, 

Very few people reahze the 
consequences of makmg a fee 
optional. If we look at past 
option ,CalPIRG and Student 
Health [nsurance. it is realistic 
to assume that most student s 
would not pay an optional 
Activity fee. At the beginning 
of the Quarter, when $8 could 
help purcha e an overpriced 
course book, an individual will 
satisfy the immediate need 

,before recognizing the long, 
term benefi t. 

Some students may take the 
attitude, "If I don 't contribute, 
it won't affect the programs 
that much ." Obviously, if 
enough people take that 
position, there won't be any 
programs. Furthermore, why 
should the students who do 
pay have to sub idize those 
who do not? (The free-nder 
problem .) Should serVIces, 
uch as the Student Lohby 

fight for lower tuition only for

those "tudents \\ ho pa\ tht'lr

the "As"llciatrd t udent 
Council" to "Those who can 
afford to pay the Council?" 

Man\' acl1vities that are 
paid for by this fee are not 
advertised a such, and 
students do not realize ho\\ 
the\' are funded, Most people 
\ aguel)' understand that 
TGIFs and Student Organiza' 
tions are supported by "tudent 
fees, But other orgamzatlons 
- the Student Lobby, the 
Internship Program, the 
Lecture Note Series. and the 
radiO station - students may 
not be aware of their funding 
ource. [f the Activity Fee is 

optional, these enterpri.es will 
be destroyed. LikeWIse, if 
tudents were to choose how 

they'd like their $8 to be spent, 
how many students have even 
heard of the Student Lobby 
Program? This program saved 
students $200.00 per quarter in 
its effort again t Governor 
Brown's budget cuts. Should 
this program be cancelled 
because it doesn't provide beer 
on Friday afternoons? 

In theory, I understand the 
good intentions of the campus 
libertarians, J agree. students 
should have a say in how their 
money is spent. This is 
precisely why we shou ld takea 
closer look at how the other 
$370.00 is pent. [t is 
unfortunate t hat this effort is 
working to ruin our own 
organization first . The 
As ociated tudent Council is 
the only body that is actually 
working for the students and

Letter to the Editor 

No Student Center Board 
'direction' necessary 
Editor: 

A confhct bet\\een the 
administration and the stu, 
den t bodv has come to a head 
in the past month . At Question 
IS the right!-. of student - to con-
trol our own fees, facilities, 
and services; more specifi-
cally, the management of the 
Student Center. 

In order to understand this 
conflict we must realize that 
the Student Center today is a 
manifestation of years of stu-
dent initiative and work. This 
complex is the only student, 
managed, exclusively student-
funded facility on campus. 
The Student Center houses 
various student organizations 
including the co-operatives 
and collectives, the print 
media. KSDT radio station 
and student service such as 
the Crafts Center and the 
EDNA's, The nine students 
that compose the tudent Cen· 
ter Board (SCB). et policy, allo' 
cate fund s and allocate space 
for the facility . The Student 
Center and its pre'ient budget 
of $500.000 per year grew out 
of a 1969 student sponsored 
referendum which directly 
responded to the student 
body's need for more space. 
During the planning stages of 
UCSD, had the administration 

considered student needs half 
as much as they did those of 
the faculty's, a S'tudent Center 
complex \\ould have been com, 
pleted long before 1974 ... but 
t hat is <In altoget her different 
'>tory. 

To l hIS day the administra-
tion contlllurs to sublimate 
the interests of the students to 
those of t he admInistration. 

pecifically, Vice-Chancellor 
Joe Watson and his assistant, 
Vice,Chancellor of U ndfrgrad-
uate Affairs Ray Dye, are 
attempting to force the Stu· 
dent Center to continue fund· 
ing a $36,OOO,a-year career 
bureaucrat to masquerade as 
the director of the Student 
Center. The administration 
has forced students fo fund 
this per on for the past seven 
years, much to the opposition 
of the Student Center Board 
and tudent body leaders. 

The job description of the 
"director" position does not 
provide the necessary "hands, 
on" management of the daily 
operations, The "director" is

In the past eIght years, many

possibility is that this extraor' 
dinanly high turnover rate is 
causcd by a b1l of cognitive dis,

from thc conflict generated 
between the actual needs of

article about Cosmo? After 
reading the WRC letter to the

a little perplexed right now 
because women's ideas about 
themselve , relationships, and 
men are changing rapidly and 
it's tough to keep up, Should 
men offer to pay for a date or 
not? Do women want to be

Editor: 
Everyone is familiar with 

the st range effects that 
colleges (particularly Revelle) 
can have on tudents' minds. 
One of these effects is a 
peculiar desire to drop things 
off of high buildings, ThiS has 
even become a tradition of 
sorts - pumpkinS rain down 
at Halloween, watermelons 
rain down at the end of the 
year and students rain down 
at finab. How ever, the 
strangest manIfestation of 
thiS habit of throwing t hlng~ 
off buildings is coming up, You

Keeping'it up 

Was Jesus Christ really as straight as they say? 
By BRUCE McDONALD 

Jec, us Christ. It' s time to get 
some things straight. 

Whatever your personal 
beliefs, there's a lot more to 
Jesus than the part you u. u-
ally hear about. For obvious 
reasons, it's the God aspect 
that's historically emphas · 
ized . If you 're Christian, you 
believe he 's forgiving, he is 
love, he died for our sins, If 
you'reJewish, you think he's a 
great prophet. Likewise, it 
you're a believer in Islam, he' 
one of the biggies, a link to 
Allah. 

And that's the first point: 
what stands monolithically as 
the first. most basic tenet for 
Christians is the fact that 
Jesus is God made man. 

So maybe we can talk a bit 
about the man. 

First of all, he wasn't an 
only child. Hegrew upin Naza, 
reth with his mother Mary, 
four brothers, and several sis-
ters. No joke - there were at 
least eight kid in the house-
hold, The Holy Family was 
huge, not just Joe and Mary 
and Jesus . So now we've got 
him in hi - familial context. 

We know very little about 
Joseph, a humble man, carpen-
ter by trade who went along 
with what must have seemed 
at t he time an outrageous plan: 
an angel dictated to hiS wife 
via a nocturnal visit that she 
was to be the virgin mother of 
God. Joseph's consternation 
must have been great , his 

pat ience sorely tried. but he 
went along with it. It paid off 
for him. 

o Mary had the baby. Sev' 
eral days later, the boy was cir-
cumcised, which IS, for 
non-Christians. an event 
which is actually celebrated 
on, of all days, January 1st. 

Far too little is known of the 
boy's formative pre-teen years_ 
Apparently Je us had a fairly 
average Galilean adolescence 
apart from isolated instances 
of getting 10Sl for a few days at 
a time. Though pu be cence 
may well ha ve been a lot easier 
in his time, we can surmise 
that there were the usual 
number of run-ins between 
di concerted parent and pre, 
cociou teenager. 

As per Joseph and Mary's 
wishes, Jesu learned a trade, 
most likely carpentry from 
Joseph, and received some sort 
of rabbinical instruction in the 
Old Testament. He was, for 
his day , thus fairly well 
educated. 

It's when we get into hi 
twenties that things start hap· 
pening. To make a long story 
short.Jesus heard of hi s cousin 
John the Baptist in Jordan, 
who'd e tablished a reputation 
of sorts by preaching the end of 
the world, baptism, and 
repentence. Jesus looked him 
up, got baptized, and left for 
the desert to meditate, 

Now we'reelose to theageof 
30. though the plot thicken 
rapidly, there's much hearsay 
and legend to sort through. 

That's the problem: .. eparat· 
Ing reality from myth . Let 's 
st ick to what we knOll'. 

First, keep in mind that 
everything he did. all the 
things he 's famous for, may 
have taken place In a .. litt Ie 
time as a few months; In an~ 
case, it wasn't any more than 
three years. That much IS 
sure. Tn face, the only detalk>d 
account is of hiS last couple of 

"The man 
was too 
prone to 
suffering ... " 

days on earth, The Passion 
really did take place, either in 
30 or 33 A.D. 

The Passion IS what you're 
best familiar with - the la t 
journey to Jerusalem, the Last 
Supper, agony in the garden , 
Judas' betrayal ; then the 
arre t, hearing and the deci-
sion to crucify; and the burial 

But back up a bit. 
Hi friends regarded him as 

a madman , He behaved 
strangely and was full of con-
tradiction, Too often, he'd say 
one thing and do another, as if 
he aid don't believe what [ 
am, belIeve what I say. 
But even what he said was con-
tradictory. He had thls'>trange 
duality of gentleness and mil-
Itancy that sends the analYSIS 
reellllg. He's aggressl\e: jut 
check out how many referen 
ces there are of him saYing 

thmg,> like "he rebuked hlln ." 
" he looked on them with 
anger," "he menaC(.>d him. " 

His temper was "omelJmc" 
worse than your .. , One dav he 
was so lIck-ed off that there 
was no frUit m a fig tree to eat 
th at he cu rsed i 1 and said no 
man should eat it'> fruit 
fore\er thereafter. 

This IS the Je"us that hi ... 
contemporanes could ..,ee III 
the flesh . Yet we usuall\' know 
him for the gentle Side 

There have been some "tu· 
dies done, analyses of hi s char 
acter and p ychology, that 
indicate to the re earchers 
that he was basically a schI-
zophrenic. But there's nothIng 
new here and, in fact , they are 
often the most interesting of 
people. It surely did not hinder 
him from making his pomts 
during those months he prose-
lytized. It' important to 
under tand this human side of 
Jesus, his personality , a you 
then try to place him in a more 
comprehenSIve hlstoncal 
context. 

By now people began callmg 
hIm Rabbi and he gat hered fol-
lowers around hIm as he wan· 
dered around GalIlee. He was 
onlv one of a bunch of IIke-
mUlded prophets. but was 
unQue tionably the mo~t cha, 
rlSmatlc, contro\'er~lal. and 
powerful. He "ent out advance 
men a. further recruiler~ , Hi" 
PR was good and he wa~ ablp to 
end up \\'Ith the blgge~t group. 
He was a dynamite public 
speaker 

And ",hat did hi' preach' 
The end of t he world Hc 
gainl'Cl a reputation a" a nma· 
ell' worker, ChOreh!, e\'en as 
one who could bring the dt'ad 
back .. And what really ).fd\t 
him hiS name was hi doct rine 
of Indifference tl) the wl)rld. 

Wh\ indifference? Bl'cau~e 
he \\:as hypcr'icnsitI\'e He 
dreaded suffenng more than 
anyl hmg ebe, any ho .. t I1lty or 
OPPOSition wa~ Just too much 
for him, The man was too 
prone to suffering, a manIC-
depressl\e. But this sound_ 
lIke many people we know, 

The big difference IS that 
Je us made hiS peronal inca· 
paclty to cope. to struggle, into 
an overndmgethical prinCIple. 
Resist not, turn the other 
cheek, thy will be done. 

ThiS , at least IS what 
Nletz che said of Jesus 

On the other hand , man\" 
people aren't likely to be ron· 
vinced It's that Simple. 

If only he'd kept a journal 
t he pitfalls and amplIfication. 
of generat ion.., of hearsay are 
not 10 our advantagt'. What IS 
written about him, in the .\eu

Jesus as 
a mortal 

continued from page 3 
d ei ti es - Buddh a, who 
expressly forbade his follow · 
ers to view him as a god ; and 
Jesus, who was equivocal on 
the issue. 

At any rate, the anecdotes 
a re proof, if not hing else, of the 
existence of the man, one who, 
it seems, isn't too different in 
his ba ic temperament than 
most of us. 

He partied , for example. No 
question, the man liked his 
vino, and he cou ld hold it well. 
He was often invited 10 cele-
bration , the man of the hour 
who could be counted on to 
bring his own, and provide sto· 
ries and a whole coterie of fol · 
lowers. It's not coincidence 
that two of the most famou s 
accounts of him are about ban· 
quets. At the wedding feast in 
Canaa, he turned huge clay 
jugs of water into wine when it 
looked like the reception would 
run dry . The las t meal he had 
with hi apo ties became then 
a mystical symbol of the com· 
ing atonement. 

Jesus was heartened by the 
attention. On a picnic one day 
he provided his friends with 
salmon and whole wheat bread 
so they could all stay on longer.

CARP hosts an evening with Cleaver 
Reporter recalls the twists and turns in ex· Black panther leader's life 

By MAUREEN 
TCHAKALIAN 

and TONI LEWIS 
Suddenly, without warning, 

two men shot down the aisles 
of HSS 2250. They were 
waving red flags and yelling 
about a third world war and 
"C IA Americani sm." We 
looked at each other and 
wondered if the whole 
dis ruption wa staged . It 
would have all been in keeping 
with urgency that CARP 
(Collegiate Association for the 
Research of Principles) the 
political wing of Sun Yung 
Moon's Unification Church, 
delivers its message tha t a 
communist take over of the 
world is emminent. 

Five 
regents 
confirmed 

By HENRY CHULMAN 
Sacramento ColTe~pondent 

Five of Governor Brown's 
six recent appointees to the 

niversity of California Board 
of Regents sailed through con· 
firmation heanngs in the 
Senate Rules Committ ee 
recently and now face final 
approval in the full Senate. 

The fi ve·member committee 
"oted unanimously to endorse 
computer fIrm president 
Rubert Noyce. attorney Jere-

m�ah Hallisey. former Regent 
and Congressmember Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke and former 
Securities and Exchange Com-
mission Chair Harold Wi l· 
liams. The committee split 3-2 
on party lines, however, 10 
approving Los Angeles attor· 
ney heldon Andelson. 

Republican com mittee 
mem ber Ray Johnson of Chico 
said he voted to oppose Andel-
son's confirmation because 
Andelson is an avowed 
homosexual. 

"My oppo ition i based on 
his avowed life tyle ," John on 
said. "Anyone who serves as a 
publicfiguregives up a certain 
amount of freedom . If he is 
going to have a private life he 
shouldn 't make it public. " 

But it \ /asn 't staged. The 
two men who disrupted the 
CARP-sponsored lecture that 
Tuesday night were members 
of the Revolutionary Com · 
munist Party (RCP). And their 
aim was to accuse the feature 
s peaker, Eldridge Cleaver, of 
returning to America to serve 
the CIA's promotion of 
patrioti sm, supporting the 
system that murdered Fred 
Hampt o n , and helping 
promote fascism . 

As the RCP began it's tirade 
against Cleaver, eight 
repre entatives from CARP 
quickly moved toward the two 
shouting men, encircled them 
and moved them toward the 
door. 

Eldridge Cleaver, the author 
of Soul on Ice and one-time 
Minister of Information of the 
Black Panth er Par ty , 
continued (somewhat shaken) 
with hi s presentation. 

But soon, a black man stood 
up and a serted , "You' re a 
disgrace to your race, a traitor 
to all black men." To which 
Cleaver quickly replied, "We 
need to eliminate the influence 
of creeps like those on our 
college campuses ." Suddenly, 
the crowd broke into applause. 
That was the last statement 
Cleaver made which brought 
a ny popular response from the 
crowd of 60 students and 

member!> of the Unification 
Church. 

A militant black leader of 
t he sixties, Cleaver has 
c hanged , and c hanged 
radically. Convicted of assault 
charges, Cleaver wrote Soul on 
Ice while in Folsom Prison 
(1957-1966). Shortly after his 
release, he joined the Black 
Panther Party. Sent to jail for 
breach of parole when gunfire 
was exchanged with police on 
April 6, 1968. Cleaver was 
released by Judge Raymond J. 
Sherwin . for being a model 
parolee who wa s only 
pursuing his political goal by 
carrying a gun. (In that 
exchange of gunfire, unarmed 
17-year·old Bobby Hutton was 
killed). In September, 1968, a 
higher court overturned Judge 
Sherwin's ruling and ordered 
Cleaver to return to Jail on 
November 27, 1968. Early in 
November he avoided pri on 
by escapi ng to Cuba. He 
returned to the US in 1975. 
The pending murder charges 
were dropped in 1979, he 
pleaded guilty to assault in 
1980, and was sentenced to 
five year probation . 

In Cuba. Cleaver began to 
expenence hiS "dislllu~J()n · 
ment with Communism." 
After he and -orne other 
Panther members went to 
Cuba at Castro' s request "to 

set up a Black Panther 
trainmg faci lit y," they 
realized that "The Cubans 
weren't doing it correctly." In 
fact, they encountered strong 
racism and were very 
disappointed . As Clea ver 
explained it, "An eVIl wind 
was blowing from the US and 
corrupt ing Cuba ." 

As Cleaver traveled to man y 
third world and communi t 
countries in his seven years of 
se lf ·imposed exile, h e 

experIenced a ..... plrltual 
awakening. " and learned of "a 
selfish. meanness in the hearts 
of all people. A meannes. that 
philosophy and economics 
cannot touch" 

HI S speech in HSS 
illus trated the 360 degree 
change Cleaver has undergone 
- from a dedicated marxist to 
a dedicated pat not. " We to 
America have the freest, most 
democratic system in the

Financial aid proposal to raise students' fees 
By HENRY SCHULMAN 

Sacramento Correspondenl 
SACRAMENTO - The 

California Post econdary Edu· 
cation Commi sion (CPEC) 
issued a report recently 
recommending the state Legis· 
lature adopt a formula for 
increa ing student fees Which, 
if adopted. could co t Univer· 
sity of Ca li fornia students an 
additional $300 per year. 

The hastily-fashioned 
study, which the legi lat ure 
requested last month. also 
recommends that any fee 
increase be buffered with a 
corresponding increase in 

tate financial aid to guaran· 
tee access to the UC for quali· 
fied low·income student . 

The UC Board of Regents 
currently u e no forumla for 
raising fees. Increase have 
instead been effected ad hoc 
depending upon the financial 
nreds at the time. 

The CPEC recommendation 
would set UC fees at 40·50 per· 
cent of the univer ity's ba e 
budget , the base being the 
average urn of the tate's 
appropriation to the univer· 
sity and property tax revenues 
for the previous three years.

university' base for next year 
will be $3,000 per student so 
the Legislat ure would be able 
to set fees anywhere .bet ween 
$1,200 and $1,500. Under the 
Governor's propo ed 1982·83 
budget, UC tudents would 
pay $1,194 per year. 

CPEC's report will be pres· 
ented to the state Legi lature 
and Gov. Brown. It was 
required under A embly Con· 
current Re olution '81, which 
A emblymember Gary Hart 
(D·Santa Barbara) sponsored 
after criticism that the univer-
sity was raising fee without 
considering the impact of the 
increases on financial aid 
recipients. 

The report states its recom· 
mendat ions are designed to 
maintain the balance of educa· 
tional quality and access to 
students regardle s of their 
abilities to pay. 

It states, "Dilemmas about 
levels of charges" .can no 
longer be resolved solely on the 
basis of each segment's percep· 
tion of its particular commit· 
ment to educational opportu· 
nity . Instead, they often 
involve tradeoffs, for example, 
between educating some stu· 
dents at little or no cost to 
themselves while shutting 
other students out completely. 

" In these ci rcumstances, 
modest increa es in charges 
accompanied by student finan-
cial a. sistance are preferable 
becau e t hey do the least dam· 
age to access and quality." 

1 he report further recom· 
mends Increasing graduate 
and profeshlOnal school tuit ion 
to 120 130 percent of under-

graduate tuition since it co ts 
more to educate them. 

The commission dodged the 
Legislature' s request to 
review the propriety of u. ing 
st udent fees for act ual educa· 
tion, in other word - tuition . 
Charging tuition would con· 
tradict the s t ate' 1960 educa· 
t ional master plan. 

CPEC Commissioner Pam-
ela Ann Rymer, who chaired 
the report committee, said 
recently the commi sion 
didn't have time to ponder the 
question of how student fee 
should be used . 

Student fee at the Univer· 
ity of California currently 

fund so·ca lled auxilary servi-
ces al ,d student service not 
related ~o specific instruc· 
tional osts. The university 
has cushioned recent budget 
cuts, thus avoiding tuition, by 
transferring part of its $18 mil· 
lion contribution for tudent 
services to instructional costs. 

UC budget analysts report 
further budget cuts requiring 
more than $150 in student fees 
will result in students payinga 
small amount of tuition 
because the $18 million 
cushion would be depleted. 
CPEC may therefore indio 
rectly be advocating tuition, 
ince a $1,500 annual fee 

would be above the level at 
which tuition is avoided. 

Umversity and student offi· 
cials agreed on the need to 
structure further fet' 
Increases, but both were hesit · 
ant tD embrace CPEC's 
recommendat ions. 

L'C Academic Vice PreSIdent 
Wilham Frazer. allending 

CPEC's monthly meeting yes· 
terday, said he oppo ed higher 
graduate and professional 
school fees and was not com· 
fortable wit h t he base budget 
percentage formula. 

UC Student LobbYIst KriS-
tin telck expressed doubt 
t hat enough financial aid 
would be available to cover t he 
suggested increa ed fees, but 
she added she \Va not pre-
pared to comment on pecific 
a peet s of t he report. 

CPEC is compo ed of 15 
mem bers represent ing various 
segments of higher education 
and the pu blic at large 
appointed by the Assembly 
speaker, the Senate president 
and the Governor. 

Its role is to study issues rel -

Several upset over SCB structure proposals 
By DOUG SMITH 

Sraff Wriler 
When former Student Cen· 

ter Director Roland Buck left 
his position last October, it 
was generally conceded that 
the amount of reponsibilities 
that he held would have been 
better managed by two admin-
istrators - one to handle the 
daily "hands on" operation of 
the complex and another to 
deal with the increasing 
demands of expanding and 
developing the Student Cen· 
ter. Raymond Dye, assistant 
vice chancellor of student life, 
formed a task force with the 
help of the Student Center 
Board to offer sugge tions for a 
restructuring of the Student 
Center staff and their 
responsibilitIes . 

The task force, composed of 
bolh !>tudents and facultv. 
camc up \\ ith t\\'O plans. Thc 
first plan dealt with e~tablish· 
Ing a JX)sitlon thaI \\ould deal 
\\ It h t he day to da\ operat ions 
of the Student Center Tht' 
second plan called for the cn:a 
tlOn of a po:,il Ion at the Stu· 
dent Center for a "long range" 
planner who would be able to 
oversee development of the 
Student Cenler complex as 
well a the establishment of a 
campu swide programming 
sy tern. 

After reviewing the findings 
of the Student Center task 
force, Dye formulated his own 
plan that not only differed in 

scope with proposals for -
warded by the task force, but 
even went so far a to include 
provisions that would change 
the relationship that the Stu· 
dent Center Board has in 
advising the admin istration on 
budget and policy matters. 

rhe SCM, comprised of nine 
students, i an advisory coun· 
cil that oversees the allocation 
of a roughly $600,000 annual 
budget. Bill Baker, SCB chair· 
man, stated that under Dye's 
current proposal. the Board 
will lose its direct advisory 
relationship with Joe Watson. 
vice chancellor of undergradu· 
ate affairs. Instead of report· 
ing to Watson, the SCB would 
have to report to a Student 
Center director who would 
then report to Assi tant Vice 
Chancellor Dye. Under Dye's 
current proposal, it would 
then be Dye who would report 
to Vice Chancellor Watson 
concermng an} suggestIOns 
I hat students had for the run· 
ning of the tudent Center 
complex. 

In a meeting that SCB 
Chairman Baker held with 
Watson last week, Baker dis· 
cussed the SCB's rejection of 
Dye's proposal. He declared 
that "in no way would the 
Board accept an advisory sta-
tus." He went on to say that if 
the SCB could not maintain 
control over the Student -Cen· 
ter's funding and budget, then 
the $12.50 quarterly fee paid

Still undeclared about your major? This workshop wlI 
give you a systematic way to investigate UCSD's 24 
majors, to learn more about your skills, interests, and 
goals, and to consider the occupational possibilities for 
majors that best fit you. A student panel, academic 
advisors, and representatives from Career Planning & 
Placement will be there to help you deal with your case of 
·undeclareditis· . 

by st udents to support the Stu· 
dent Center would serve no 
purpose. 

Other concerned students 
feel as strongly as Baker about 
Dye's proposed re tructuring 
of the Student Center's admi-

nislrative staff. At a meetmg 
held last Tuesday night at the 
International Center, students 
said that it had taken many 
years for !>tudents to attain 
their current advisory and 
budget·making position and 

that they had to organize 
together In order to let the 
administration know that 
they were opposed to any tu

did not consider student inter·

Carpenter vies for senate seat 
with emphasis on education 

By HENRY SCHULMAN 
Sacramento Correspondent 

Senator Paul Carpenter (D 
- Santa Ana) admits he rarely 
agrees with Governor Brown, 
who he is challenging for th 
Democratic nomination in the 
race to succeed US Senator S.r. 
Hayakawa. 

One view they share, how· 
ever. is 'California's need to 
beef up technICal education in 
California to keep the st(llt-
com pet it iVt, m t he mu~hro()Ill ' 
109 compull'r and t'leL"lronlCs 
mdustne~. 

'" always ... upport the Gm · 
crnor when hc i ... correct, and 
t his IS one of the fe\\ tImes I 
think he is," Carpenter 
remarked yesterday after the 
Senate sent to Brown for hIS 
signature Carpenter's bill 
e ·tablishing the California 
Mat hematics Project, in which 
the University of California 
Board of Regents will oversee a 
program desigped to have uni· 
versity in tructors tutor ele-
mentary and high school 
teachers on new innovations 
in math. 

The bill, approved 28-0 in 
the Senate recently, states 
that increasing math skills at 
the pre-college level is neces· 
sary because of our increas· 
ingly technological society, 
and recognizes mathematics 
as a fundamental background 
in these fields. 

"The decline in mathemati· 
cal s kill s of students in 
schools, college and universi· 
ties in California affects all 
students, but is particularly 
acute for women students, 
minority student., and stu 
dents rrom lower income 
groups," the bill reads. 

"While ~Dme college:; and 
unl\ erSIIIC'i are ImprO\'lng 
l'()ur~es in the tearhmg (if 
mat hemal IC";' it (·(lnclude". 
"t hl~ will nol tulh address I hl' 

problem, ince the number of 
new teacher to be hired in the 
future will be relatively smaiL 

"Therefore, the Legislature 
recognizes the need to assIst 
existing teacher 10 gainIng 
skills necessary to mcrease 
mathemati cs proficiency 
among students." 

More than, 1;)0,000 was 'iet 
as ide in thIs year's budget for 
the project, but Brown froze 
the mone\' latl' Ia.t \t'ar (1--

leader are ~eeking ways to 
off et a projected revenue 

hortfall next year of up to $2.5 
billion, budget commIttees 
have endorsed some of 
Brown 's planned funding 
increases in high·tech 
education. 

Carpenter conceded the life 
of the math project depends 
upon "the extent legislators 
will be sensitized to the impor' 
tance of mathematics in the 
larger scheme of things. 

"One of the things I told the 
Senate today is we have kind 
of slacked off In the post· 
Sputnik years," and Ameri-
cans cannot take for granted

technological education and 
indu try, he aid . 

Details of the program ha\-e

Jesus on aggression, madness, love, and wine 
continued from page 4 -

And his friends were unsa-
vory, too, for which he's 
become famous. Whore and 
thugs, the wretched and mal-
contents. He was a focal point 
for the losers. 

Jesu liked a joke like the 
rest of us. Sadly, though, we 
are woefu ll y lacki ng in 
accou nts of his humor, but can 
easily suppa e he cracked up 
at some of t he losers he ended 
up wit h, loving them at the 
same time. At least wecan su r-
mise he had enough wit. for 
example, to ex ult in foo lingt he 
guys who tned to trIck him 
with the coin when they asked 
about paymg tribute to God or 
Caesar. 

Whate\er personality afflic· 
tlon he mayor rna} not have 
had, it's obviou:, that. in hiS 
day and aft er, he was a hit. 

Now for some news, though . 
It's a delusion to think that 
ChrIs t ia n itv started With 
Jesus. His was the sameJewish 

God and J es us is, for them, the 
last of the prophets. The Tal-
mudic Jews ended up not 
accepting him because the 
Genti les bui lt a world religion 
around him. No, it was his fol -
lowers who establis hed Chris-
tianity. Specifically, it was 
Pau l who fir st began to codify 
and disseminate the beliefs of 
what was to become Chris ti an-
i t y in to o ur hi s t ori ca l 
perception. 

The problems bega n when 
the world didn't end as he'd 
predicted. His fo llowers were 
left holding t he torch and had 
to think of something fast to 
carry the Ideas on. The Christ 
Idea itself, for one: that whole 
idea of t he Resurrect ion 
wasn'l even inaugurated b) 
Jesus, bUI by the \ iSlOns of 
Y1ary Magdalene and some of 
the apostles. 

The idea of sacrificial deat h, 
of redemptIOn of belIevers 
through that deat h, the idea of 
Ch rist as second person of the

only the tudents. Further-
more, it i the only organ ized 
body in w hich ·tudents can 
work to invest igate how the 
measll rable amoun ts of money 
are spent. 

If .ome students are 
unhappy with the specific 
allocation of funds, then they 
cou l d take t hat i n to 
consideration when voting at 

election time. The Associated 
Student Council is the very 
bottom of a huge sy tern based 
on representa tive government 
supported by universal 
taxation . Wit hout a manda-
tory fee , there is no 
government and no represen-
tatIOn. And without the 
representatiyes, the students 
have no voice!

Trinity - the e " bas ics" of 
Chri s tianit y r ea ll y have 
nothing to do with Jesus. They 
came later, 

But something of his per on-
ality was enough to have a 
direct impact on tho e close to 
him at the time for them to 
arrive at the grand io e inter-

pretation of the crucifiXIOn 
and resurrectIOn, which is the 
starting point. 

As far as faith goes, you 
either have it or you don't. 
That's not t he Issue here. I 
don 't even know If there's an

things to do is to renew

and believe in the American

believe that with democracy 
we can light a new candle in a 
very dark moment in his tory." 

He sees the black man in 
America on two front s - color

But he returned to some of 
his old messages on Tuesday 
night when he urged the black, 
the student, and all Americans 
to organize. While he feels all 
problems can "be olved in our 
democratic institutions," he 
recognizes a crisis in the 
American people who feel their 
votes are insignificant. Once

Connection between genes Caffeine taken off safe list 
and cancer explored 

By ELIZABETH McKEE 

In the course of ~clentlfic 
mqUl ry , one often comes upon 
a null h ypot hc~io., or a theoT). 
t hat just doesn'l seem to "pitn 
out." Frusl rat Ing as t hI" 
experience may be. I he data 
collected III the tesl ing of such 
a hypot hesis mal prO\t' quitt' 
fruitful in producing 
al t ern ative theories . An 
example of ~uch a o.,lluation 1!1 
the dI scovery of the eX Istence 
of o n coge n es (ca n cer-
producing genes). 

Because tumor viruses were 
found to be the cause of many 
cancers in animals - such as 
the sarcoma virus in chickens 
- scientists hypothesized that 
a viru would be discovered 
that was cancer· producing in 
humans . For years, the 
attempts to find a tumor virus 
particular to humans proved 
fruitless, but these studie 
revealed a surprising 
alternative cause of human 
cancer - cancer ·causing 
genes. 

In 1970, C. Baltimore of 
MIT . S. Mizutani and H. 
Temin of the University of 
Wisconsin discovered that a 
certain viru reproduced by 
transcribing (copying) DNA 
from RNA. The virus was 
dubbed "retrovirus" for its 
ability to reverse the normal 
process of tran cribing RNA 
from DNA. 

Deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) is the material which 
contain all the genetic 
information of an organism. 
and reside in the nucleus of 
every cell of the organism. 

DNA "ulrl'Cts" the develop-
ment (If an organism 11\ first

R!'1A then travels from the 
nucleus of the cell to dIfferent 
pa rts of t he ce ll w here its 
sequ ence of amino acids is 
translated into an analogous 
c haIn o f amin o ac id . 
Transcription is mediated by 
enzy mes. These different 
amino acid chains are the 
different proteins that carry 
on different me t aboli c 
activities of the cell . 

Retroviruses, consisting of 
an RNA with a protein coat, 
reproduce by reversing this 
process. Once a retrovirus 
infect a cell, it transcribes 
itself to DNA, which is then 
incorporated into the DNA of 
the host cell. Then in the 
normal course of transcribing 
its DNA to RNA, the host cell 
produces many new copies of 
the virus RNA. 

The di scovery of t hi s 
phenomenon alone . while 
quit e interesting did not shed 
light on the cause of human 
cancer. However. it was 
discovered that a certain virus 
which reproduced in this way 
could transform chicken cells 
in culture, i.e. could cause 
normal cell s to become 
cancerous in t he lab. This

According to Dr. Ronald W 
T hom p on, vanou!> defect., 
could be produced from a 
caffeine intake ranging from 
the eq uivalent of drinking two 
cup of coffee to 24 cups of 
coffee each day. Thi is an 
intake that the Food and Drug 
Administration feel s is t he 
level of caffeine a human 
receives daily from beverages 
and drugs. 

While not yet certain that 
caffeine-related birth defects 
can occur in humans, it has 
been determined that caffeine 
can cross the placenta to the 
developing baby. And caffeine 
can also get into the breast 
milk of mothers who nurse.

Cancer genes 
continued from page 13 
"virus-gene" wa discovered 
by G. Martin in 1970. 

As further attempts to find a 
virus which induced cancer in 
humans were unsucce ful. 
the relation hip bet ween 
retroviru ses and human 
cancers continued to elude 
many scientists. 

In 1972, D. Steblin, Varmus, 
and j. Bishop decided to test 
the hypotheses that cancer 
could be caused by genes in the 
organi m' genome. Following 
the line of reasoning that the 
RNA equences of certain 
viruses could induce cancer, 
these investigators thought it 
po ible thal analogous 
sequences of DNA (or genes) 
could exist in regular DNA 
strands that at times could be 
cancer-inducing. 

To test if thi were 0, 
radioactive DNA wa . 
produced from a retrovirus by 
the process of reverse 
transcription in lab cultures. 
This radioactive DNA 
sequence was used as a probe 
to search for analogous DNA 
sequences in uninfected 
animal cells. If an analogous 
sequence did exist in these 
healthy cells, it would become 
apparent through the 
technique of molecular 
hybridization whereby imilar 
sequences of nucleic acid 
hybridize or clump together. 

The results were astoun· 
ding - this method revealed 
analogous DNA sequences in 
fish. birds, mammals. and 
humans. Furthermore, the 
investigators were able to 

establish that these genes are 
active in healt hy cell by 
hybridizing RNA made from 
these DNA sequences. 

The existence of these genes 
in many type of animals 
implie that these genes mu t 
have some very fundamental 
function which aids survival. 
as the e genes have survived 
the process of evolution tor 
long periods. One fundamental 
function they have been linked 
to is the pho ' phorylation of 
tyrosIne . This chemical 
process i" involved in the 
regulat ion of cell growt h. 

The question then, remains: 
how do genes which exit>t In 
healt hy cells and regu late 
normal cell fun ctions become 
cancerous? Many scientists 
' uppon the hypothe is that 
these gene become cancerous 
when some event (such as a 
ca rcinogenic chemical 
causing a change in DNA 
sequence) causes these genes 
to function at a higher than 
normal rate - resulting in a 
cancerous growth of cells. 

Thus the earch for the 
cause of one of our most 
dreaded diseases "outside of 
ourselves" has led to the 
finding that cancer may be 
caused by what is most basic 
to our exi tence - our own 
genes. Ironically, the material 
which determines such 
characteristics a the color of 
our eyes. which regulate all 
the nece sary life·supporting 
metabolic functions of our 
cells may ultimately also 
contribute to our propensity to 
contract cancer.

of UC campuses, the UC D 
jazz Ensemble, directed by 
jimmy Cheatham, will present 
their spring concert Tue day 
at 8 pm in Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

The Ensemble, the only col· 
legiate group to have been 
invited to participate in the La 
jolla jazz Festival of 1981 , will 
Interpret jazz chart from the 
repertoire of Duke Ellington, 
Count Basie, Thad jones and 
other "greats." 

On hand to play with the 
jazz Ensembles will be trum· 
peter Burgess Gardner, for· 
merly with the Ray Charles 
Orchestra and Horace Silver 
jazz Group. In addition to 
Gardner' compo itions, the 
Ensemble will play some of its 
own inventions and improvisa' 
tions as the spirit dictate . The 
show is co·directed by Mark 
Dresser, bass, Chris Klich , 
reeds. and Ladd EI Wardani , 
tenor saxophone, piano. 

Cam Weir, a ri ing young 
star of the Jazz Saxophonists 
will perform his original com 
positions with his contempor· 
ary "Jazztette." And most 
Importantly, representing 
community involvement -
the Clairemont Jazz Ensemble 
from Madison High School, 
directed by Cecil Lytle, chair· 
man, Music Department, and 
hi' on Eric Lvtle on electric 
bas will perform ~h favor· 
ites as "Song for My Father" 
by Horace Silver and "jordu" 
by Clifford Brown. 

The lrrOUP has grown from 

half a - dozen performers to 
more than thirty participants

Sartre's 'No Exit' 
opens this \Veek 

The UCSD Department of 
Drama is presenting Jean-Paul 
Sartre's one act play, No Exit 
(Huis Clos). at the Mandeville 
Recital Hall on May 5. 6,7, and 
8 at 8:00pm nightly, directed 
by Rob Bundy. William Inge's 
one-act comedy, Bus Stop will 
open May 13 and play nightly 
at 8:00pm through May 15, 
with a 2:30 matinee on Satur-
day, May 15, at the Mandeville 
Recital Hall, directed by Lorna 
D_ Limberg. Tickets to both 
s hows are $2.00_ 

French philosopher, nove-
list, essayist and playwright, 
Sartre was one of the chief 
exponents of existentialism, 
which places its main empha-
sis on man's existential expe-
rience rather than abstract 
ideals. The idea that an indi-
vidual's personality is deter-
mined by the view others have 
of him i dealt with in No Exit. 
First produced in 1944 at the 
Theatre du Vieux-Colombier 
in Paris, it has become one of 
his best-known plays. 

No Exit is a "philosophical 
melodrama" set in a unique 
kind of helL The three people 
consigned to it gradually 
reveal their true characters, 
shaped by their past actions. 
They realize that they must 
eternally judge each other and 

themselve . This is their tor-
ture, their damnation, their 
helL 

William Inge opened Bus 
Stop, a memorable comedy-
drama, at the Music Box Thea-
tre in New York in 1955 to 
accolades from the critics. 
Best known for his sentimen· 
tal, romantic pictures of life in 
the small towns of the Midw-
est, Inge was awarded the New 
York Drama Critics Circle 
award and the Pulitzer Prize 
for Picnic in 1953 and the 
Academy Award for his 
screenplay Splendor in the 
Grass in 1961. 

Bus Stop finds us in a tawdry 
roadside diner, where the 
assorted travelers aboard an 
interstate bus are stranded 
overnight. Chief among the 
passengers are Cherie, a 
country-girl-turnelj-saloon 
singand Bo, a rambunctious 
lovesick cowboy intent on car-
rying her off to be his wife. 
This motley crew comes 
together for a few hours that 
will simply and almost unob-
trusively change their lives in 
thi warm-hearted, compas-
sionate and endearing portrait 
of the common man_ 

All p rformance are in the

Former city council

Floyd Morrow says, "The 
fundamental goal of the Peace 
Rally is to rai se the 
consciousness and awareness 
of people in San Diego and to 
draw public attention to what 
is taking place in Was hington 
with the military budget. We 
want to energize people to take 
action to force our government 
to recognize that the will of the 
people is 1101 for war, but for 
peace. 

Small kids and big art at museum ing the child's imagination and developing his creative skills is 
vital for a child's balanced edu-
cation. The visual arts provide 
a vital source of communica-
tion and enrichment, a mean 
of expression t hat is invalua-

The highlight of the collec-

Dorin ThIbodeau. Each Olece, 

about four inches tall, has a 
personality of its own. The 
white ches men are presuma·

ing in robe. and smi ling. The 
queen even posses 'es plump 
breasts pressed tightly 
toget her by her Elizabethan 
cor et. The black pieces 
assume the traditional role of 
evil. Each is spooky and 
slight ly disreputable. The 
bishop appear, in fact. as

Young Art 82 owe much in 
the way of gratitude to the 
teacher whoareinstrumental 
in developing the e children's 
art kills. [n the wake of cur-
rent cutback and pre sures

Softball \Vinds up 
\Vith t\Vo wins 

By J OE F ALLETT A 
Senior Staff Writer 

Triton soft ball wrapped up the 
eason in style, taking games 

at home this weekend from Cal 
Lutheran and Whittier College 
by identical scores, 6-2. 

It wa no problem for 
pitcher Jill Keene and Co., as 
Triton bats went to work from 
the out et in both contests 
The team scored all t heir runs 
in the first three frames 
against Cal Lutheran and 
three in the first inning 
against Whittier. The 
insurance came in the home 
sixth on an error, a bunt 
single. two sacrifice and four 
olid hits. The wins put the 

Tritons one game over .500 at 
home, and brought the, eason 
record to 1 0-17 overall, 
including two forfeits . 

The Triton finished 4-2 10 
California Coast AthletIC 
Conference play. 

It wa all heart and tape for 
the Triton agam as they 
fielded nine walking wounded, 
and pu t it all on t he line for t he 
wins. They dove, bunted. sltd 
and stole to bring the tv .. 0 \\'ms 
home. 

In one play, against 
Whittier, Leigh Ann Layton 
walked and then stole second 
on a complacent defense. 
which let her round fIrst and 
go to second. The thro\\ from 
the amazed catcher dropped 
s hon of t he fielder as Lavton 
stepped on the bag. .

Layton took the Brooks

WIth good plays on line driVe, 
and bad hops grounders. 

It was these latter season 
wins that proved especially 
sweet as UCSD only fielded a 
consistent group of players 
during the late season. The 
Tritons had to watch earlier as 
seven talented players left the 
c1u b because of time conflicts, 
scholastic ineligIbllit} or, 10 
one case, a conflIct wnh the 
coach.

wore a number of hats for the 
Tntons. In one game the)

next a different poslllon.

Jan Martin, the left-handed

Track finishes season at 'Windy Warren' 
By THOMAS' SCHMIDT 

taff Writer 
Well, my Black' Beach idea 

didn't go over so well, so it is 
back to "Windy Warren." I'm 
going to play this article 
straight. 

First let me give you the 
score: in the men's track com· 
petition, it was Point Lorna 
College 90, UCSD 63, and Red· 
lands University 21. In the 
women's competition, it ended 
up Redlands University 59, 
Point Lorna College 48'h, and 
UCSD 43. 

As usual, the track condi· 
tions were unfriendly, the 
weather was cool, overcast 
and windy. Only a handful of 
die· hard track enthusiasts 
showed up to witness the elon· 
gated proceedings. 

The Poin t Lorna coach was 
again guil ty of leaving some of 
hi thoroughbreds at home to 
rest, after all Coach Crakes 
wouldn't want to expose hi· 
big studs (0 the wonderful 
world of WlOdv Warren Field. 

ished third in the javelin, with 
a heave of 17] /. 

Marty Thompson's vault 
was in fact in vain because the 
deadline to qualify for the Dis· 
trict Championships was 
April 23 - there are late bloo-
mers here at UCSD! 

In the 5000-meter Brian Bar-

the finish line unmolested . 
In the 800· meter, UCSD's 

Marty Thompson again came 
close to qualifying in an excel· 
lent time of 2:03 .6, just 1.7 
..;econds off the qualifying 
time. 

Chris Bowlus turned in 
another strong performance in 

-

In the 400·meter interme-
diate hurdles, Molley Whea· 
tley pulled out fourth place. In 
the 400· meter Mandy Merz fin-
ished second in 64.3. 

She also finished second, in 
the high jump with a 4'6'h". 
Javelin thrower Wheatley fin· 
ished second, with a toss of 

The most exciting race or' 
the day was the 1600'meter 
relay. the anchorman, known 
to me only as Brad, overran 
Point Lorna's uptight anchor-
man and easily sailed through 
the last 100 meters for the 
victory. 

In the women's 16oo·meter 
relay, the UCSD "California 
Golden Girls" outwitted, out-
charmed and outran the out· 
classed contingent from Point 
Lorna College; they finished in 
an excellent time of 4:25.6. So 
California Golden Girls, you 
know who you are! You were 
the highlight of the meet. 

The UCSD women will be 
competing next week in Irvine 
at the Southern California 
Women's Invitational Track 
Meet. 9 UCSD women wi ll 
make the trip. while 14 UC D 
men will trek northward to the 
NAIA DI!;trict Champion~hips 
at UCSB. And as Coach Andy 
Skief said ,·It's been a good 
year, and we have had a lot of 
fun!" And after all, isn't that 
what sports is all about? I 
guess I can't play it straight. I 
would rather have you all up In 
arm . 

The UC 0 men's 400-meter 
relay team did manage to 
break the 45 second barrier 
and qualify for the NAIA Di . 
trict Champions hips, a did 
the 16oo·meter relay team in a 
time of 3:30.27. 

The field events were again 
dominated by the opponents. 
UCSD 's Murray Robinson 
earned a first in the triple 
jump with a hop, skip, and fly 
of 40/'h". 

UCSD's "California Golden Girls" jet around the track. As a sports writer we 
always walk the fine line 
between being a propaganda 
arm for the coach and pros ti · 
tuting ourselves for a laugh. In 
this article I have managed to 
do neither, from now on I'm 
going to write the way that 
pleases me, because if you 
can't please yourself, ain't 
nobody going to do it for ya! 

In the pole vault , two UCSD 
men qualified with vaults of 
12'6" - the aforementioned 
being Tim French and Marty 
Thompson. French also fin-

lon, who ha already qualified 
for the NCAA championships 
at Naperville, Illinois, in the 
the 5000-meter , the 1500· 
meter, and the steeplechase, 
outgutted Point Loma Col-
lege's Hernandes . Barton , 
after dogging Hernandes for 
the first six laps, pulled away 
in the last half to sail across 

the 15oo·meter with a time of 
4:02. 

In the women's competion, 
Leslie Saunders ran a very 
respectable 20:23 in the 5()()()' 
meter. In the 1500·meter, Kim 
Stempien posted a 4:58.9. Next 
week at Irvine, she will once 
again try and qualify in the 
800· meter.

Yokomoto breaks jinx 
By BILL FISH 

taU Writer 
Keith Yokomoto finally did 

it, and it couldn ' t have come at 
a more appropriate time. The 
small righthander won his 
first game of the year in the 
opening cont es t o f a 
doubleheader Saturday. It was 
Yokomoto 's las t regular 
season start that marked the 
end o( his losingjinx, and place 
a olld lock on the Tnton 
bas eball team 's pla yo ff 
position. 

Yokomoto needed a clutch, 
tW(Tout , tW(Trun single by 
Mike Brown in the fifth inning 
to tie dow hi fir t victory. The 
final was 3· 1, as an msurance 
run was added by t he Tritons 
in the · ix t h. Yokomoto 
notched onl\' one strikeout, 
but walktd ju. ( two batters. 

Perhaps the most signifi-
ca nt statIstIC, howe\'er . 
belonged 10 the defense. ot a 
~Ingle error was committed in 
t he field . a rare phenomenon 

considering who was on the 
mound. U ually a hard-luck 
pitcher, Yokomoto had been 
victimi zed by co untl ess 
mistakes from his teammates 
during the season. 

Though the win in the early 
game was what Coach Lyle 
Yates termed "our Number 
One objective," UCSD was 
once again massacred in the 
final showdown. This ti me, 
the score was 13·1, wi th 
freshmen Chris Wood and 
Mark Cartier allowing the 
onslaught. 

The outcome of the second 
game did not dampen the 
spirits of thi" Tnton club. 
however. because following 
the ,;plit pla}ers and parents 
celebrated with champagne. 
"Thl" team i" "ky·hlgh right

coach . "We're read v for the 
playoffs." . 

appears in almost every pitch· 
ing "Top Ten" category in the 
league. 

What worries the 6'7" hurler 
is whether or not any scouts 
have paid attentIOn to his suc· 
cess. Going the distance la'>t 
Thursdaj against powerful 
San Diego State. Allen was 
hoping to display his ski lls for 
a scout from theSan Francisco 
Giants' organi zation. In tradi· 
tional form, Allen allowed just 
three earned runs, fa nned nine 
batters, and walked just two 
- an unbelievable perfor· 
mance con idering the high 
caliber of the Aztec offense. 
The scout. however, was not 
in attendance. He just "never 
made it." 

There is no hes itance in 
Allen's response to the ques· 
tion of what he wants to do 
aft er thi season. "I'd like to 
spend maybe two years in the 
minors," he says. "Then I'll 
have a big decision to make, 
depending on how I do." 

The decision he refer to is 
whether or not to keep throw· 
ing for the supreme goal of 
making the major leagues, or a 
permanent pitchin~ ret ire· 
ment. Should Allen not make 
minors, he will probably take a 
coachingjobat his alma mater, 
La 10ll a High. He was offered 
the opportunity to coach jun· 
ior varsity basketball and 
baseball. "It's pretty much 
mlOe if I want it," assures 
Allen.

called t h(' season, "wort h· 
while. 

"The team helped keep my 
spirits up. There were times 
though \\ hen I wondered 
whet her it \\ as all worth it. 

"We had so many people 
start and then leave. We won 
four out of seven when we 
finally got it together." 

Jan Martin called it a "tough 
season" but added, "We had so 
much fun toward the end of 

.the season. It's the mo t fu n on 
road trips I've had in two 
years." 

he said the fun the players 
had toward t he end accounts 
for the late eason win the 
Tritons pulled off. 

Layton, who hit seven times 
in her last 12 at bat, called it an 
interesting season. one where 
the players would show up for 
practice unsure of where 
Monteverde would be playing 
them that day . 

as a p('r"i(J~,,~\'ecan't pull it off 
as a lcam 

DaVIS added, "I think the 
last two games symbolized 
that. No one wanted to play at 
that position, but we did what 
we had to and we pulled it off." 

If was a season of which the 
Tritons can be proud. They 
played their heart out and 
never said "die" to adversity 
or to hard times when players 
were lost, or when their coach 
was on the block. 

Sports people seem to thrive 
on stat and records, but the 
figures here don't tell the half 
of it: the two games lost by 
forfeit, the heartbreakers lost 
in the last inning. the freak 
hops t hat allowed the final run 
to put it away. 

Stats can not measure the 
bottomless well of spirit these 
women played with through-
out the year when it would 
have been easy to let it go; a 
spirit literally contagious to 
the fans on the sidelines. 

\0 at an) time and blow the 
doors off the Opposition . Hut 
there was somethmg magical 
about the 1982 Tritons, 
something special that 
transcended the diamond and 
I ncluded everyone from 
Monteverde through the II 
team members. 

The loyal fans, those 
familiar faces at each game, 
often belied t heir numbers, 
roaring like a stadIUm-full on 
the good plays and coming 
forth with the chatter and 
encouragement during the 
lean times and the rallies. 
They were not unsung in the 
locker room as Monteverde 
was appreciative of "those 
regular people who supported 
us through thick and thin." 

The encouragement was a 
factor that kept the spirit 
going, a factor missing last 
year when often there was one 
fan at the game and when the 
press was nonexistent at best. 

25 

"Everyone worked hard and 
we pulled it off," she said. "We 
all thought, 'If I can't pull it off 

It is nice to have 16 or so 
talented super players to call 

As things seemed finally to 
click in the latter season, the 
obvious question seemed, "Did 
anyone wish the season could 
go on, now that they were 
finally putting it all together?" 

It was a bewildering season for Coach Dan Monteverde_ 

Tritons split doubleheader 
continued from page 23 
acknowledged leader and the 
team jells whenever he 
pitches. " 

Soon the roach's praise will 
be delivered in past tense 
Allen's 85 mIles·per-hour fast-
ball (which he says is "a\'er-
age" velocity for majors) , will 
be sorely missed In the Triton 
lineup. -The athlete regret~ 
leaving. "1 wish 1 could stay 
\'vith these guys another two 

years because they ju t keep 
improving." 

College veteran Bob Allen 
may at least get to watch his 
former teammates, should he 
resort to the coaching job and 
stay In San Diego. At thiS 
pomt, howc\er, he has no Idea 
where he will be at this time 
next vear. "I don't carl' who I 
pitch 'for," he says " as long as I 
get t he chance." If he gets 
the chance. 

A resounding "no" echoed 
through the locker room. All 
said they were happy to see it 

nd. Monteverde summed it 
up, noting the mjuries had a 
lot to do with it 

"If the team was (SIC) headed 
for the playoffs and the 
natIOnals, sure the~ 'd want to 
play. But just to out and pia\' 
agam, they'd ha\c to sa} no ,f ,

Democratic senators David 
Roberti of Los Angeles, Barry 
Keene of Mendocino and Nick 
Petris of Oakland voted in 
favor of his confirmation. 

None of the other candidates 
spent more than three minutes 
at t he witness table. 

Burke, who served briefly as 
a regent in 1979 before Brown 
appointed her to the Los 
Angeles Cou nty Board of 
Su pervisors , st ressed her 
legis lati ve experience - s he 
was a California State Assem· 
bly person and US Congress· 
member - to committee 
members. She also reminded 
them she served on t he Califor· 
nia State University (CSU) 
Board of Trustees. 

Hallisey, a San Francisco 
attorney, said he serves on the 
board of trustees for St. 
Mary 's College in Moraga. He 
also sits on the CSU Board of 
Trustees, a position he will 
relinquish upon becoming a 
regent. 

Noyce, telling committee 
mem bers his family was full of 
educators, quipped , " [ come

The Senate is expected to 
grant easy confirmat ion to 
Burke, Hallisey, Noyce a nd

Andel on to run mto trouble 
because he is gay.

Professor of Sociology, UCSD 

Q How would you define where the reproductive and

It's not surprtsing that

they feel like an embattled 
minority. 

Q: That's why gay and other 
alternatIve lifestvles have 
become so politiciztd? 

A: I think so. The whole 
point of the Briggs InitiatI ve 
was. "Should gay people teach 
in schools?" It seems to me 

The Lesbian and Gay Organization at UCSD does not 
discriminate on the basis of age, color. physical disability. race. 
religion. sex ual orientation. or sex. All students. staff, and 
faculty are invited to attend any or all of our functIOns. 
regardless of heritage or lifesty le.

issue is .. hould gayness be 
pre ented as an alternative 
lifestyle that one can choos in 
a 'cafeteria' of lifestyles?" 
Many people believe that. 
which is why it came to be an 
issue. In fact. the issue draws 
upon a considerable amount of 
belief in this country that gay 
lifestyles are perfectly 
legitimate alternative

business what people do in the

Q: You have defined the 
traditional family. In light of 
this discussion, how do you 
define the modern family? 

A: I gues I wou ld have a 
phenomenological definition of 
families that draws on 
whether or not you experience 
yoursel f as a family . Whether 
or not you have made a 
commitment toeach otherthat 
you think i going to last over a 
period of time. Whether or not 
you have a quality of intimacy
