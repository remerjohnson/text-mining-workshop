issue a temporary restraining order 
(TRO), which bars the enforcement 
of Proposition 209 at the state and

In an attempt to halt the imple-

eliminates all gender- and race--based 
affirmati ve-action programs in Cali-

action suit agaiMt the UC Board of

take it out of our hands." 

"The UC would have to begin to 
disregard race in its admi ' ions poli -

hope to safeguard UC affirmative-

In rc\ponse 10 several students dl. rupt·

209 demonstrations. tudents Against Dis-
crimination and Preferences (SADP) co-
founder Boris Slutsky last week liled allega-
tions of studer.t misconduct with the Student 
Judicial Affairs office. 

"I see the events of Nov. 13 as an attempt 
by opponents of Pro '209 to hold the nor-
mal functioning of e university hostage.to 
their demands," utsky said, "1 think the 
rest of us shou ldn' t sit idly by and watch this 
happen ." 

In the wake of Proposition 209' s pas-
sage, which called for the elimination of all 
tate-admi nistered race- and gender-hased 

preference program. between four and five 
dozen student marched around campus and 
disrupted classes with chantS and clapping. 

Slutsky collected signed statements de-
scribing the events that transpired from sev-
eral students in Chemistry 6A and Philoso-
phy 27 lectures. According to one account 
by an anonymous witness. the protesters 
completely disturbed the already in progress 
9:00 a.m. Chemistry 6A class at York Hall. 

According to the witness, a group of 
about 10 people entered the lecture hall and 
one spoke to Lhe professor. 

The teacher reportedly replied, "This is 
not public announcement time. This is class 
time. I'm holding a class." 

The group then began clapping, and was 
joined by 15 or so other people who the 
witness said had attended the lecture but 
were not enrolled in the class. 

"While other students attempted to hout 
down the protesters, the teacher left the 
classroom," the witness wrote. 

Slutsky filed two such statements with 
his complaint to Student Judicial Affairs 
Director Nick Aguilar' s office.

The number of auto thefts on 
campus has been decreasing, after 
peaking at 142 in 1994. A total of 
93 cars were stolen last year, and 
51 (;ars havc becn taken so far this 
year. 

RA IT announced last week the

investigation into a car-theft ring 
targeting late-mo<!el spon-utility

recovered more than 35 stolen cars

they' re going to get it."

Propositions 209 ... 187 
Are Not About Gariocide 

There is such a thing as overstating an argument. When 
an argument is strong. overstating it will make it appear 
weak; when it is weak to begin with, overstatement will 
make it sound ridiculous. This is exactly what happened 
with the recent MEChA protest against Propositions 209 
and 187. 

The protesters tried to draw a link between ending pref-
erential standards for racial minorities and genocide. and 
between effons to establish merit-based standards and 
civil war. Marchers yelled such catchy little rhymes as. 
"Pete Wilson, you can't hide, we charge you with geno-
cide," and "Civil rights and civil war, we won't take this 
shit no more," at the top of their lungs. 

To put it bluntly, genocide is when a group of people is 
exterminated on the basis of their race, not when the pet 
program of some group or another is ended. Bosnian 
Muslims, Bantu and Hutu tribesmen in Central Africa and 
European Jews know what real genocide is. For the 
MEChA protesters to make the claim that ending a prefer-
ence program approximates what those people have gone 
through is absurd. , 

The-same sort of thing can be said of the "civil war" 
analogy. Ask your average Bosnian if he feels that people 
deprived of special benefits are experiencing approx~mate­
Iy the same things that he eltperiences. The analogy IS a 
painfully obvious overstatement, a blatant instance of 
"crying wolf." 

We are aware that the protesters disagree with 
Propositions 187 and 209, and that they have the right to 
peacefully express that disagreement. However, if the pro-
testers want to persuade anyone that their views are cor-
rect , they should find better arguments. 

aHICslor Dynes PtoI.lOtes 
MucbNeadad ca ..... Spill 

After only one quarter as UCSD's chancellor, Robert 
Dynes has proven himself to be much more student-
friendly than his predecessor. 

Unlike the reclusive Richard Atkinson, who showed lit-
tle interest in student relations between 1980 and 1995, 
Dynes leaves his office every now and then to see what's 
going on around campus. 

Dynes has been spotted watching Triton athletic events, 
bicycling around campus, bowling frozen turkeys and jog-
ging through the eucalyptus trees. 

He's helped wide-eyed freshmen move into their dorm 
rooms; he's sat through interminable A.S. and Academic 
Senate meetings with aplomb. Most important of all, he's 
demonstrated much more than a modicum of concern for 
the students that make UCSD the great university that it is 
today. 
. Not conte,.t to rest in the shadow of Atkinson's reputa-

tion as a fundraiser par excellence, Dynes also played a 
major role in drumming up enough alumni support to

Dynes has even found time in between running the 
campus and managing his Mayer Hall research lab to stop 
by the Grove Caffe and chat with students. If that weren't 
enough, he skips the Faculty Club's white-linen luncheons 
from lime to time to rub elbows with students at the Food 
Co-op. ~ 

Dynes has done a tine job bringing UCSO's diverse 
population together and is well on the way 10 creating the

JUDICIAL REVIEW TRIUMPHS 
OVER PROPOSITION 209 

COMMENTARY: Judge Thellon Henderson rightfully reco~ni~e.d 
Prop. 209 as an unconstitutional attack upon women and nunonlles 

-B r e n t 
JOHNSON 

Smells Like 
The Truth .# 

At home on Thanksgiving, I 
had occasion to appreciate our 
Constitution upon reading a 
headline in the San Jose 
Mercury-News: "Judge Blocks 
Prop. 209." 

I also had OCcasion to smile 
at the outrage of a man -
whom I suppose represents the 
"common 

man" posi -
tion - who 
wrote a. let-

. t.er 10 the 
editor in response to the article: 

tions and knowledge to ensure the rights of the 
minority. Then again. they may have been rich 
landowners who feared their wealth might be taken 
away by the less-affluent masses. 

Whatever the- case, they showed how the 
Constitution prevented a majority from overwhelm-
ing the minority to gain an unwarranted advanlage. 

Perhaps the most important concept they dis-
cussed was the idea of judicial review . . 

"The interpretation of the laws 

" I vOl cd for [Proposition 209] 
because I feel affirmative action 
does not work and is discriminato-
ry against non-minorities. I don't 
claim in any way to be an expert 
on constitutional law .... I vote in 
all elections and, until recently, 
thought that my vote was my 
voice. Now a renegade judge is 
telling me .. . that our voice doesn't 
mean anything." 

I laughed out loud after reading 
this letter from the smoldering 
"politically active legal secretary" 
who was insulted by "renegade 
judges [who) revoke what is clear-
ly the will of the people ... " 

u.s. DIstrict Judge 
lhenon Hendenon ••• 
Isaota .. rene .... 

is the proper and peculiar province 
of Ihe courts. A constitution is. in 
fact , and. must be regarded by the 
judges as, a fundamental law .... If 
there should happen to be an irrec-
oncilable variance between [a con -
stitution and a legislative act]. .. 
that which has the superior obliga-
tion and validity ought to be pre-
ferred; or, in other words, the 
Constitution ought to be preferred 
to the statute, the intention of the 
people to the intention of Iheir 
agents." 

"Nor does thi s conclusion by 
any means suppose a superiority 
of the judicial to the legislative 
power. It only supposes that the 
power of the people is superior to 
both, and that where the will of the 
legislature, declared in its statutes, 
stands in opposition to that of the 
people, declared in the 
Constitution, the judges ought to 
be governed by the taller rather 
(han the former. They ought to 
regulate their decision by the fun -
damentallaws rather than by those 
which are not fundamenlal. " 

Knowing a legal challenge to 
Proposition 209 was imminent. I 
began doing some research. I start-
ed with the Federalist Papers. that 
classic work of political theory 
that examines and details our 
Constitution. As il turned out, no 
further research was required.

One cannot avoid associating the FederalISt

hands of the majority. 

Constitution is the most basic 
enactment of our civilization's will . If any law con-
flicts with the Constitution. then the Constitution 
must prevail . Furthermore. a judge is the final arbiter 
of what is constitutional - it is his "proper and pecu-

given legislation. The papers' authors - James Madison. Alexander

6 OPINION 

JUDGE: Court 
ruling does not 
violate voters' choice 
Continued from peee 4 
ciary's supremacy over the legisli-
ture . Rather, using the 
Constitution as a guide, judges 
implement the people 's demand 
for judicial review over legisla-
tion. 

U.S. District Judge Thellon 
Henderson, who placed a tempo-
rary restraining order on the imple-
mentation of 209, is not a "rene-
gade judge" subverting the power 
of the people. Rather, Henderson is 
doing hi s job, preventing a majori-
ty from exercising its numerical 
muscle to inundate a minority. 

FREEDOM: 
Constitution is being 
ripped to shreds 
Continued from page 5 
without the consent of the owner, 
nor in time of war, but in a manner 
to be prescribed by law. 

Alllendmelll IV 
The rights of the people to be 

secure in their persons, houses, 
papers, and effects against unrea-
sonable searches and seizures, shall 
not be violated, and no warrants 
sha ll issue, but upon probable 
cause, supported by oath or affirma-
tion, and particularly describing the 
place ,to be searched, and the per-
sons or things to be seized. 

These rights do not apply to tar-
gets of federal law-enforcement 
oflicials, panicularly someone sus-
pected of dealing drugs. [n such 

As the above letterhack men-
tioned, most of us are not experts 
in constitutional law. However, it 
doesn't take a lot of effort to rec-
ognize that judges do often frus -
trate the current will of the peo-
ple. The will of the people is not 
necessarily acceptable in the eyes 
of the fundamental law - in this 
case, the Constitution. And let me 
assure you, Proposition 209 is 
constitutionally unacceptable. 

Proponents of 209 claim that it 
eliminates preferences based on 
sex or race. However, it does not 
eliminate other preferences, such 
as those based on geographical 
location , or those given to veter-
ans and their chi Idren. (Why honor 
somebody for someone else's 
achievements?) 

cases, law-enforcement officials are 
allowed to break in and enter 
homes, based entirely upon the 
"evidence" of anonymous tips and 
professional snitches. No redre s is 
permitted against the law-enforce-
ment agency in any case, even if the 
target was innocent of any wrong-
doing. 

Amendmenl V 
No person shall be tried for the 

same offense twice and be placed 
on trial (double jeopardy), unless 
said person is a resident of Southern 
California, and a defendant in a 
heavily publicizcd, racially divisive 
courtroom drama. In such cases, if 
the defendant recei ves a verdict that 
irk residents of the community, the 
defendant shall be forced to endure 
as many trials as it takes to get the 
verdict that the people want. (Sec 
People v. L. Powell and S. Koon.) 

Amcndmenl VI 

The UCSD Guardian 

The Constitution Is 
the most basic 
enactment of our 
civilization's will. If 
any law conflicts 
with tile 
Constitution, then 
the Constitution 
must prevail. 

For example, the UC can still 
give preferences to the chi ldren of 
major donors to the university, 
those who possess above-average 
musical ability and those who can 
take a football, dodge a bunch of 
beef cakes and do the Cabbage 

In the wi ... realm of

"I ........ " of the 
future are long on 
long-wInded 1~1ogy, 
but short 011 the 
nut.and-bolts know-
how of history and 
government. 

In criminal prosecutions, the 
accused shall enjoy the right to a 
speedy trial, and be judged by a 
panel of people who are either not 
smart enough to escape jury duty, or 
so pathetic that the prospect of 
being paid $5 a day to sit for hours 
on end in an overheated room is a 
meaningful upgrade to their current 
sorry life. 

Patch in the end zone. 
Furthermore, the UC regents and 
administrators can sti ll intercede 
on behalf of unqualified, connect-
ed individuals. 

[n effect, while other groups 
and individuals can appeal to gov-
ernment to consider their special 
status and frivolous talents, 
women and minorities who have 
historically and statistically 
demonstrated a need for special 
consideration cannot. 

The Supreme Court ca lled this 
"selective disenfranchisement" 
when it overturned Colorado's 
anti -gay rights initiative. The 
court decided that any law declar-
ing "it shall be more difficult for 
one group of citizens than for all 
others to see aid from government 

A mendmefll VII 
[n suits at common law, the right 

of the trial by jury shall be pre-
erved, allowing slick lawyers to 

bamboozle millions of dollars out 
of businesses for "punitive dam-
ages." Stupid people can spi II cof-
fee over themselve and then win 
suits against fast-food stores for 
making the coffee "too hot." 

A mcndmeflf VII/ 
Cruel and unusual punishment 

shall not be intlicted on the incar-
cerated; it shall be intlicted on the 
population at large with syndicated 
shows like "Bay watch" and 
"Seinfeld." 

AmendmenllX 
The enumeration in the 

Constitution of certain rights shall 
not be construed to deny or di par-
age other rights retained by the peo-
ple, unless they are selfish, greedy 
clods who make too much money. 

Thursday, December 3. 1996 
is itself a denial of equal protec-
tion of the laws ... " 

If Gov. Pete Wilson and UC 
Regent Ward Connerly, the chief 
proponents of Proposition 209, 
truly wanted to eliminate unfair 
preferences, why didn't they elim-
inate all of them? Why produce a 
document that takes away advan -
tages from some people and not 
others'! 

According to the Supreme 
Court, for Proposition 209 to pass 
the constitutional test, it would 
have to eliminate all preferences, 
not just ones based on gender and 
race. You can take preferences 
away or leave them all alone. You 
can' t go halfway, eliminating 
those that you dislike while leav -
ing others unmolested. 

In this case, we are free to use the 
IRS to shake them down for as 
much as we can. 

Amendment X 
The power not delegated to the 

United States by the Constitution, 
nor prohihited by it to the states, arc 
reserved to the states respectively, 
or to the people. 

The federal government shall 
use the provision of its right to "reg-
ulate interstate commerce" as wide-
ly as possible, justifying all types of 
nosy intrusions into private com-
merce and monkeying around with 
st ate aff ai rs. 

It is often said that the 
Constitution is a "li ving , breathing 
document." Considering the state of 
the Constitution's relevance to our 
current state of freedom, [ hope 
somebody in the federal govern-
ment knows CPR. 

But I wouldn't bet on it.

However, the Council did not take 
any action to aher the budget nor 
was the issue raised again last night. 

A .S. President Coleen Sabatini 
also presented her repon for the last 
two weeks. 

A s part of a systemwide com-
minee to evaluate the selection 
process for the st udent regent , 
Sabatini met with UCLA Chan-
cellor Charles Young, Regent 
Meredith Khachigian, former Stu-
dent Regent Carol Mock and cur-
rent Student Regent Jes Bravin, 
among others. 

According to Sabatini, the com-
mittee was concerned that the stu-
dent regent' s role had changed over 
the years from being one of the 
trustees on the Board of Regents 10 
thai of a student representative. 

A .S. members said Ihey were 
concerned student-body presidents 
and UCSA Board members arc no 
longer able to dircctly address the 
Board, accept within the time desig-
nated for public comment. 

This reOects a changc from pasl 

years, though no official policy 
change was ever enacted. The com-
minee will submit several recom-
mendations to the Board of Regents, 
at least one of which will address the 
lack of direct access to the Board of

Both Jenkins and Jones said in-

measures are the best way to fight 
auto Iheft. 

"[People! are underthe miscon-
ception that auto thefts and burglar-
ies happen in the middle of the 
night, but most happen in the middle 
of the day," Jenkins said.

OUT IN STYLE 
THE CORNERSTONES OF THE UCSD 
VOLLEYBALL SQUAD SID FAREWELL 

A foundation is defined as the base on which some 
slrUcture rests, Per the 1996 UCSD women's volleyball 
team, that foundation came in the form of a dedicated and 
emotionat group of six graduating seniors, 

Coming into their final season, Ihis group faced the 
prospects of coming off a sub-par year by 
Triton volleyball standards, adjusting to a new 
head coach. battling a rash of injuries and 
confronting a schedule lhat had the leam trav-
eling Ihroughout the country 10 face the top 
Division m teams in the nation. Much like a 
home left to weather a powerful storm, this 
foundation held its ground and led UCSD 10 an 
outstanding season and a spot in the NCAA Quanerfinals, 

Appropriately enough, this seniorclass was made up of 
six players, the number required on the court , In the final 
regular-season home malch, in frontoffamily and friends, 
lhe six seniors were given the opportunity to be in lhe 
staning lineup together. In an emolional scene, senior 
seiter Anne Su, who had 10m her anleriorcrutiale ligament 
earlier in the season, was atile 10 return 10 the court for a 
single poinl 10 be with her teammates. 

Departing from the Tritons Ihis season is a powerful 
triumvirale whose members have engraved their names in 
UCSD hiscory: Madelyn Ripken, Christine Chi and Mieke 
Biesheuvel. Ripken, an opposile hitter with a characteris-
IIC soulhpaw swing, provided the emotional spirit for the 
squad as a captain and eSlablished herself as one of the 

most prolific hitters in the Triton record books, Chi, a 
perennial All-American selection. continued her domi-

. nance at the middle blocker posilion. and proved helself to 
be one of the top frontline players in the nation, Biesheuvcl, 
a dominanl outside hitter, was the gO-lo player for the 

offensive attack and provided numerous clutch 
kills with an aggressive swing. ' 

Another important component of the suc-
cessful UCSD season was the learn 's depth and 
Head Coach Duncan McFarland's willingness 
to look to his ~rves 10 provide any necessary 
spark, Outside hitler Kelly McGlothlin and 
middle blocker Shelly Oraf were key catalysts 

of the Triton attack when the team stumbled, Bolh saw 
significant playing time throughout the season. 

The 1996 senior class led UCSD to a 24-7 ~ord and 
a national No, 4 ranking for Division IJI. One of lhe 
highlighls for the squad included a viclory in the NCAA 
Western Regional championship againsl arch-rival Cali-
fornia Lutheran, Earlier in the season, Cal Lu had defeated 
the Tritons in a hard-fought five game malch, Bul in the 
playoffs, UCSD turned the lables and played inspired 
volleyball to sweep the Regals in three games, and capture 
lhe regionallille, 

As the foundation for the Triton volleyball squad, lhe 
seniors provided the cornerstone necessary for one of the most 
successful seasons in recent history, The six have left a strong 
base from which the leam can continue to improve.

Athenas Bow Down to Mighty Tritons 
BIG TIME: UCSD's women bounce back from their first loss of the season, humbling the defending SKYAC champions, 62-53 
By Travis Hili 
Staff Writer 

It sure didn ' t take long. 
The UCS D women 's basketball 

team needed all of one game to 
show thc rest of Di-
vision III that this 
year'ssquad isateam 
to be reckoned with. 

After a crushing 
defeat at the hands of 
the University of SI. 
Thomas, the Tritons 
faced another sti ff 

challenge: the Athenas of Claremont 
Mudd Scripps College. 

The Athenas are the defending 
champions of the SKY AC confer-
ence, and are expected to win the 
same title again this year. 

Claremont was also coming into 
RIMAC arena with a 3-0 record, 
and 'many were watching this game 
interested to sec just how Head 
Coach Judy Malone's team would 
respond to the challenge. 

The Tritons answered the ca ll 
likechampions,controllingthegame 
from tip-off to the final buzzer, and 
improving their record to 3-1. 

While the final score was 62-53, 

tremely intense, fighting for re-
bounds, hilling the noor for loose 
balls and even ~toppi ng rare fast 
breaks. 

"We had a very intense practi ce 
on Monday," senior guard Cindy 
Yamasaki said . "It was probably 
our hardest-working practice all 
year. We have been working on our 
defense because we figure if our 
defense is there, the offense will 
come." 

As a result, the Athenas could 
not get anything done on offense, 
and the Tritons turned their turn-
overs into points. 

Yamasaki led the early charge, 
hilling big three-pointers that at one 
point extended the lead to 22-9. 
Yamasaki finished with 10 points . 

Karli Jungwirth, Anne 
Westmoreland and Pam Contini 
were dominating the post, scoring 
frequently and seemingly grabbing 
every rebound. 

Jungwirth and Westmoreland 
both finished with 10 points . 
Jungwirth led both teams with 12 
rebounds, while Contini contribut-
ing seven. 

Their play inside freed up out-
the margin of victory 
could very easily have Dec. 3 va. Claremont 
been much wider. The 

side shooters Yamasaki , lanessa 
Bayda, Tristen Teasdale and Kri sta 
Poehler to take theirshots. Tcasdale 
came off the bench and scored five , 
while Poehlcr added eight. 

The Athenas could not crack the 
carly 13-pointleadforthe rest of the 
half, thanks to the Tritons overpow-
ering defensive play against an of-
fense that couldn 't handle the pres-
sure. 

The Tritons continued to control 
the game in the second half. The 
Athenas eame out and tried to play 
more aggressively on defense, but 
UCSD responded with pinpoint 
passing to open up easy baskets. 
That only frustrated the Athenas 
further, and instead of aggressive 
they got sloppy. 

"They were the dirtiest team I've 
ever played against," Yamasaki said. 
" I think their coach taught them to 
play that way. They were hackingus 
all over the place." 

That didn 't bother the Tritons 
either. They kept their intensity level 
surprisingly high throughout the 
game, and easi ly thwarted a mini -
comeback by the Athenas, who could 
never get closer than nine points. 

This was an impressive 
victory for the Tritons, but 
they cannot rest on their lau-
rels. Point Lorna is coming to overmatched Athenas

Pomona Points Out Triton Faults TITLE: UCSD will host Final Four 
STREAK: Without the services of injured point guard Adam Libby, the Tritons cold shooting in the 
first half allowed Pomona-Pitzer to surge ahead, and hand UCSD dropped its third straight loss 

Continued from pale 20 

is importanlto note that most of 
these star athletes will segue into 
the Olympic team because t here is 
no professional polo in the U.S. So 
for UCSD students who get tired 
of studying thi weekend, they have 
the option of watching future 
Olympians duke it out in the pool. 

By Kevin Mclaughlin 
Staff Writer 

TheTitanic, as we all know, was a 
great luxury liner believed to be un-
sinkable. II set ail .from port with the 

were able to maintain a consistent 20-
plus point bulge throughout the game. 

"It's ju t a maller that we have 
young players put in a difficult posi-
tion ," Triton Head Coach Greg 

wake of the loss of poi nt guard Adam 
Libby. Without an experienced 
ballhandler and consistent defensive 
presence in the point,the men gave up 
numerous fast breaks and went 

through the motions of a stagnanl 
offense all evening. 

The team looks to the return of 
third-year player Mark Sebek as a 
lifeboat of sons. He should give the 

highest hopes, only to 
hit an iceberg. The 
UCSD men 's basket-
ball team has likewise 
run intodisa ter,as in-
juries totwo key start-
ers are beginning to 
take a toll. 

The downward 
spiral continued Tuesday night, as the 
Tritons dropped an ugly game to 
Pomona·Pitzer, 97-73. Watchinglheir 
record drop to 3-3, the men played an 
uninspired game against a much live-
lier and more competitive team. 

The men managed only 25 points 
in the first half, throwing careless 
passes, missing jumpers and playing 
inadequate defense to find themselves 
down by 20atthe break. 'nle hoop ters 
turned the ball over 23 times on the 
night, compared to only 16 turnovers 
for Pomona. 

Lanthier said. 
"We're probably 
our own worst en-
emyrightnow. P y-
chologically Ihey 
[the players] are de-
flated because they 
can't meet the ex-
pectations they set 
for themselves." 

A bright spot for 
the Triton was the 
play of seldom-used 
freshmen Danny 
Pitts and Cole 
Miller. Though the 
effort was too lillie, 
too late, Pi tis 
showed himself to 
be an able defender 
in the post, tallying 
live blocks in only 
13 minutes . An-
other young buck, 
Miller showed a 
nose for the basket, 
shooting 5 of 6 to 
score 12 points in 
as many minute . 

laki Rubenstein/Guardian 

learn a much-
needed boost, 
bringing expe-
rience and 
leadership to a 
team that i 
sorely lacking 
lhosequalities. 
Entering a 
competitive 
tournament at 
the University 
of Redlands 
thi weekend, 
the men need 
to bail water 
fast, and hope-
fully right their 
rapidly sinking 
ship. 

"!t's bad timing forourcampus 
and it would have been great if our 
team was in it," Grosse added. 
"But I think everyone now, the 
team included, wants to put on our 
best face to show what a great job 
we cou Id do. I n terms of crowd, we 
think we are going to have a capac-
ity of 13-1400. And we have sold 
over 1,100 tickets for Sunday's 
championshipgameandnear 1.000 
for Friday. So we're going to have 
a big crowd out there." 

For UCSD, this event shows 
the campus community i worthy 
of championship-caliber events. 

"l'1I be the first one to admit 
that the down sidetothis is that our 
staff has been laxed," Grosse ad-
mitted. "We don ' t have a huge 
staff like Stanford, so we have a 
few people who have been work-
ing their tails ofrto get this d ne." The Sagehens combined a bal-

anced offensi ve attack, with five play-
ers scoring in double digits, with a full 
court press most of the game that Icft 
the Tritons playing catch-up all night 
long. Shooting only 29 percent in the 
lirst hal r, the fate of the game was 
sealed early. Though a number of 
bench players contributed to a stal-
wart second-half effon, the Sagchens 

Afterstartingthe 
season 3-0, the Tri-
tons appear to be 
sinking fast in the Lane Duty: Matt Aune (5) goes up for a shot against Pomona. 

"We need 
to take carc of 
those thingswe 
eancontrol ; the 
players are 
w o rryin g 
about those 
things linju-
ries] that they 
can' t control 
and that 's not 
produclive," 
Lanthier said. 

" I think it 's going to be a great 
event. !t 's not only a chance forus 
to show the collegiate world what 
wecando,butit'saloachancefor 
a lot of water polo kids to come out 
here and see thi s campus. We' re 
going to have a I I of people there 
and the pool is going to be rock-

EIGHT IS 
ENOUGH 

MINNESOTA MUD LEAVES SENIORS 
YEARNING FOR MORE SOCCER 

It all came down to one final over-
time game in the Minnesota mud, and 
when all was said and done: the UCSD 
men's soccer team came up one goal 
shorl of defeating Luther College for a 
trip to the second round of the NCAA 
Division III Championships. 

" It ' disappointing to end 
the way we did, but we ac-
complished our goa l of reach-
ing· the playoffs," senior for-
ward Chris Fong said, "That' s 
all we could have a ked for, 
considering the conditions of 
the la t game [at Macalester College]." 

The final loss of the 1996 campaign 
not only ended the Tritons' short-lived 
playoff hopes, but also signaled the end 
of eight distingurshed oecer careers at 
UCSD. 

"As far as the seniors were concerned, 
our goal was to win a championship," 
sweeper Joel Kosakoff said. "I was happy 
with the team, and by the end of the year, 
we had really come together. We were 
the victims of circumstance and we were 
sad because we never had the chance to 
prove ourselves as a good team." 

Nate Hetherington, Jose Ocampo, 
Chris Siok , Brian Turner. Jay Newcomer, 
Blake Thompson, Kosakoff and Fang 
have completed their athletic eligibility 

and have played their last game at Triton 
Soccer Stadium as members ofthe UCSD 
squad. 

Triton Head Coach Derek Armstrong 
now faces a huge challenge in preparing 
for next season after losing valuable for-

wards, versali Ie mid fielders and 
capable defensemen who have 
made their marks in the UCSD 
record books. 

Most nOlably, five of the 
eight departing seniors were 
members of the 1993 National 
Championship team, which fin -

ished its stellar season with a record of 
21-2-1 and a 1-0 victory over Williams 
College for UCSD's third NCAA Divi-
sion III National Championship. 

''I' m surprised we haven ' t won again," 
Kosakoff said. "We have only been get-
ting beuer, and I definitely would have 
expected to come closer [to a champion-
ship!. I wanted it so bad, not only for 
myself, but for the seniors who came 
later and never won a championship." 

The Tritons did not advance past the 
first round of the playoffs in 1996, but it 
wasn't due toa lack of ability. As the top-
seeded team in the Western region, the 
Tritons finished with a 10-6- 1 record, 
including a mid-season nine-game win-
ning streak.

Associate Athletic Director Ken Grosse 
and Triton water' polo Coach Denny 
Harper got to work on trying to get the 
NCAA to come to La 10lla for the 
championships. 

"The NCAA was looking for a site 
in Southern California," Grosse said. 
"So I talked to several members ofthe 

water polo comminee to see what it would 
take, and we put a bid in and we ended up 
getting it. I think they were excited to go to 
another site [besides going to Long Beach like 
previous times]. II was really pretty simple, 
Denny had the inkling and he and I worked on 
making it Ii reality." 

UCLA, the defending national champ'ion 
after defeating Cal Berkeley 10-8 in lite 1995 

Because of the efforts of Harper, Grosse, 
the athletic department and the San Diego 
International Sports CouJN:il, UCSD will see

(opens Dec. 13) 

The Nonhwest music 
explosion defined by "the 
Seattle sound" is captured in 
"Hype." which features 
commentary and rare con-
cen footage by bands such 
as Nirvana. Soundgarden, 
Pearl Jam. Mudhoney and 
the Melvins. It explores the 
rise of the "grunge" scene 
from a local stage to one of 
nationwide fanfare and fixa-
tion. "Hype" traces the 
transformation of the "alter-
native" sound into one that 
was mainstream and that 
essentially infiltrated pop 
culture and generated a 
multi-billion dollar industry. 

Ridicule during the 
reign of Louis X~I was a 
fate equal to death. It 
meant physical !lnd emo-
tional devastation. In the 
King's Court. one would 
have to prove himself

vive such circumstances.

who at fi r~ i , taken in by 
the glamour and exclusive-
nes of being a pan of the 
Court. His wit and charm 
wins him the friendship of 
the King. However, Ponce-
ludon comes to an unex-
pected realization about the 
politics associated with the 
King's Court which 
prompts him to then work 
against the norms of soci-
ety in order to illustrate the 
injustices of the day.

Shine 
Child prodigy illuminates 

By Leslie Wane

"~hine" is a sometimes dis-
turbing, sometime life-affirming 
biography of the remarkable 
piano vinuoso David Helfgott . 
For those who are planning to see 
the movie, read no fur-

Taylor). As he begins to receive 
invitations to study music abroad, 
his domineering father threaten 
to disown him if he leaves. As 
abuse turns physical. David turns 
for help to his caring piano pro-
fessor (John Gielgud). 

Soon he nees to

be adjusting to a happi-
er life at college. David decides to 
master the near-impossible piano 
piece, the Rachmaninoff Third. 
When he performs it in a chool 
competition, he is immediately 
hospitalized for a nervous break-
down.

and even the climax has needless-
ly been included. This i"s a movie 
that deserves every award it has 
earned, but hype may indeed kill 
the respect that it deserves. 

Through a series of flash-
backs, the movie takes us from 
Helfgott 's child -prodigy days 
when he was governed by an abu-
sive father to his lonely adult-
hood. Here he was estranged 
rrom his family and is a hyper, 
stuttering schizophrenic. 

Oppressive father Peter 
(Armin Mueller-Stahl) is the 
main figure in David's life, even 
after he has refused contact with 
his son, Yet the slubbomess and 
abuse that he pushes upon 7-
year-old David (Alex Rafalow-
icz) stems from love for his chil-
dren. 

David matures into a skinny, 
goofy teenager (the gifted Noah 

MOSIC 
TRADER 

This leads the movie to itspre-
sent tense. Adult David is played 
by the amazing stage actor Geof-
frey,Rush, who is fascinating to 
watch, With the help of an 
astrologer (Lynn Redgrave) who 
soon marries him, David makes 
his way back to the concen stage, 
The movie spends far too little 
time on his adulthood 
- it is only believable because 
we know it happened. 

"Shine" is a worthy movie 
about the riveting pianist David 
Helfgott. However. the less one 
knows about the story, the better 
the film appears.

because all I eat are Big

fonn of red meat that I eat. 
I eat Big Macs a lot, 
enough so that I'll be dead

cf{tng in the JVew year 
Some real resolutions to stick by 

By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

The signals are all there. The 
weather's getting colder. down to a 
freezing 65 degree daytime high in 
San Diego. The shopping malls are 
packed with parents dragging 
screaming children to wet Santa's 
lap. The football season is winding 
down and basketball wanning up. 
That 's right boys and girls. it 's New 
Year's Resolution time. 

This is the time of year when 
people look back on the mess they 
made of the previous 365 days and 
say. "I'm not going to be that bad 
again. This year is going LO be dif-
ferent." And then they make cute 
little li sts of the things they will 
improve in the coming year. 

Unfortunately. most people don't 
end up sticking with their new goals 
much past January 2. For example. 
someone who has vowed to lose 
those nagging 10 Ibs. worth of love 
handles goes out to dinner with

friends and is doing pretty well until 
that conniving waiter brings the 
dessert cart by the table. The mind is 
willing, but the nesh is weak. and the 
unfortunate restaurant patron con-
sumes decadent dessens in an orgy 
of oral splendor. Another rewlution 
down the old toi let. 

I think that the reason why 
everyone always fails at sticking to 
their resolutions is that they always 
pick hard thiJ'lgs on which to focus. 
People want to lose weight. get bet-
ter grades. usc time more produc-
tively and vi it Grandma at least on 
weekend a month. 

These are exactly the type of 
resolutions that regularly end in 
failure. If you want to have a reso-
lution that you' lI definitely accom-
plish, sti ck to the easy SlUff. 

Resolve to be a complete hedo-
nist in the upcoming year. Eat drink 
and be merry. for tomorrow you may 
be graduated and in the real world 
where you have a boss and a job and 

no time for fun. Resolve to sleep 
through an early moming class at 
least once a week. (0 add as many 
empties as possible to your beer bot-
tle collection. Now these are the 
types of resolutions you can keep. 
and then you won't have to feel like 
a failure and flake for not following 
through on your plan for the year. 

Now, some of you out there 
might be thinking about making a 
resolution to cut down on your 
alcohol consumplion in the com ing 
year. lI 's always good to enlist a 
frie nd to help you with big goals. 
As I am a friend to one and all. I 
happi ly volunteer my help. 

I wi ll glad ly take any unopcned 
cont ai ners of alcohol you might 
have lyi ng around and make sure 
that they are disposed of properly. 
Just bring them by the Guardian 
office and leave them. care of Chris 
Schreiber. After all, we wouldn 't 
want all ypu to be exposed to all 
those nasty temptations ...

When the show first went on the 
air. the following Saturday the LA 
nnws ran a story about it. The fol-' 
lowing Monday after the LA TUMS 
story we got calls from all over the 
place to do a movie version of the 
show. So there was interest in 
doing a film from the beginning. 

The Paramount-Viacom merger 
was one of the things that slowed 
us down on production. There was 
also the question of animation ver-
sus live-action. It also takes a while 
to actually tum it into a movie. It 

should have taken a shorter time 
than it did, though.

Maybe. Of course, "developed" 
might not be the right word for 
Beavis and Butlhead. For someone 
who doesn't get cable or hasn' t got-
ten into Beavis and Butthead yet, 
the film and the characters in it 
should stand on their own.

I was actually just making the 
Qriginal "Beavis and BUllhead" 
short ("Frog Baseball") for anima-
tion festivals, and thought it .might 
be a way to get into comedy or 
other things that I was into. It 's 
kind of like that saying, "Build it, 
and they will come." With the 
movie, the studios came to us. My 
dream has always been to write a

I'm a better animator than I am a 
drawer. The design for the "peyote" 
sequence is something I actually 
worked on with Rob Zombie from 
White Zombie - he designs and 
does his own album coven and 
videos. Rob drew the cycle of head-
bangers and I also had people from 
the show working on it. I can actu-
ally animate a lot better than people 
think just from seeing the show, but 
I never dreamed of taking that to 

Dis~y or anything like thaI.

I did three original shorts with 

Beavis and Butthead, and I just 
wanted to use them to break in. I 
never expected them to become 
cultural icons. I thought it would be 
funny to take all the work that goes 
behind animation to be about two 
stupid guys. "Frog Baseball" is a 
short we spent about two days 
shooting, and I honestly didn't 
think anyone would like it. I 
remember waking up and thinking 
that it was a stupid w!lSle of time, 
and what was I doing. After I put 
sound on it, it started to get better. I 
thought the first five "Beavis and 
BUllhead" episodes were horrible. 
After that, it got better. 
Do you ever .... forced ..

I don't think I'm holding back. 
To me, it's all atxrut trying to make 
it funny. It's not like the goal's try-
ing to push the envelope. I just 

want to let laups. I've got to keep 
tbem one-track characters. I proba- • 
bly could have had Beavis and 
Bullhead say the F-word in the 
movie, but it didn't seem right.

I overhear people doing the 
voices. I was walkin, around 
UCSD one day, and it was really 
funny ... I was walking around cam-
pus behind this bi. frat guy ,oing 
"Hey Beavis ... " 
........ BuIIh .... 
ever .. laid? 

Maybe Beavis will, with a much 
older woman. I set lots of letters 
from women in their SO's who are 
into them. But I think if they ever 
score, it would be like Charlie 
Brown, and Lucy pulling the foot-
ball away. If he ever got the' ball, it 
would end. That may be the way to 
end the show.
