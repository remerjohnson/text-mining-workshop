Coor Employment Record a Disaster 
Editor: 

Have you ever used any form 
of illegal drug or narcotic? Are 
you a homosexual or have you 
ever been associated with one? 
Have you ever participated in 
any type of march, riot, sit-in, 
or demonstration? Are you 
concealing any information 
about subversive, revolu-
tionary, or communistic 
activity? Have you ever stolen 
any money in your life? Have 
you had any extra-marital 
affairs? 

According to sworn affi-
davits by many striking Coors 
employees, these are just a 
sampling of the questions you 
are asked while your body is 
attached to a polygraph (lie-
detector) device, when 
applying for any job at the 
Adolph Coors Brewery. In 
addition, questions have been 
asked about the applicant's 
financial situation and religion. 

Williams Coors, company 
president, has publicly stated. 
" You have a constitutional 
right not to work at Coors." The 
implication is that if you decide 
to work at Coors, you give up 
your constitutional rights . 
Coors not only forces its 
employees to submit to a 
polygraph test a t any time (or 

be fired), they also require 
employees to submit to a 
physical .examination. 

The Coors Company has a 
long history of discriminatory 
hiring practices. Coors has 
been cited twice by the Equal 
Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) for 
discrimination against racial 
minorities with respect to 
hiring practices. The company 
is currently on probation until 
1980, at which time they must 
show signiJicant increases in 
minority employment. 

On the subject of job safety, 
Bill Coors stated, "I just 
question whether it is worth 
billions of dollars to do away 
with 8% of the work-related 
accidents." Ecologically, the 
Coors company policy isjust as 
unsound. Brewery discharge 
from Coors pollutes the 
drinking water of the 50,000 
resident of nearby We.st-
minister . Colo. Drinking Coors 
may be a haza rd to your health . 
Since Coors does not pasteurize 
their beer . refrigerated 
transportation and storage of 
the beer is required. Many 
stores ignore this safety 
consideration by storing and 
selling un refrigerated Coors 
beer. 

All efforts to organize a union 
shop so workers can speak up 
for their rights have been 
successfully obstructed by the 
Coors management. As a 
result, the AFL-CIO launched a 
nationwide boycott against 
Coors beer. It has gained the 
support of many minority, 
religious, 'and labor organi-
zations. The California Public 

Interest Research Group is now 
organizing a student boycott of 
Coors beer at campuses all over 
the state. Since students as a 
group ate major consumers of 
beer, they can together have a 
major impact on this labor 
union struggle. 

Coors representatives and 
former Coors workers will 
meet here for an open forum on 

Monday, February 5, from 1-4 
pm in the North Conference 
Rm . Students can come in at I, 
2, or 3 o'clock to ask their 
questions. Be there and voice 
your concern about the 
injustices at the Coors 
Brewery.

A New Yorker Returns for Christmas 
By Debbie Birman 

It's been a really strange 
Christmas vacation. 

When I got ocr American 
Airlines flight ISS, direct from 
Sunshine City, San Diego, 
California , I spentmyfirsthour 
and five minutes in J .F.K. 
airport waiting for somebody to 
pick me up. Unfortunately, 
tlobody in my family (but me) 
believes in big welcomes. 

I had just spent four long and 
confusing months in California, 
a ttending UCSD, my first time 
west of New Jersey. It wa s like 
a long sociological study on a 
strange, smiling society . What 
the heck, I seemed to be smiling 
a lot more , too. And tan. And I 
could sit in a cha ir for more 
tha n five minutes without 
fa lling oCf. And my walk had 
s lowed down to a fast trot. I felt 

pretty good . 
For some reason I didn't 

really expect to experience any 
kind of culture-shock in New 
York. After all, it's where Ilive. 
And, since I partied most of 
finals weeks , I was kind of 
looking forward to going home. 
I needed some sleep. I felt 
pretty smug about things and 
intended to make everyone a 
little envious, and give them the 
impression that I had turned 
into a stereotypical California 
beach bum. 

To my great surprise no one 
was very excited about my 
adventures on the west coast. 
Those who did only made it 
worse by exhibiting a sort-of 
glib, superioristic attitude. At 
dinner, later on my first night 
home, my mother opened with : 
" So, California 's the place with 

all those weird cults. Meet any 
nice boys lately?" 

That should have been the 
worst. Of course it wasn't. My 
best friend asked me how I 
liked UCLA, and my younger 
brother wanted to know if our 
men's basketball team was 
going to make it to the NCAA 
finals this year. Myoid 
boyfriend just looked at me and 
smiled. " You ' re tan, " he 
gloated. " You must be getting 
California Bra in Rot. What's 
the weather like in Marin 
County, anyway? " 

It became apparent pretty 
soon that this was going to be a 
long four weeks. Around the 
middle of the first week I 
decided to try and have an all-
out good time . I began 
commuting into Manhatten , 
where ' I accidentally landed a

temporary job in a Very Chic 
Hungarian pastry shop which 
catered to the Beautiful People 
and their fat guests. I fell in love 
with the assistant manager. 

I had the blue-ribbon 
intentions of saving all the 
money for a new three-speed 
bike but my resistance broke 
down and I spent everything 
before I earned it in 
Bloomingdale's department 
store . Then, to my own dismay , 
I got into a temper andquitCour 
days and one hour after I had 
started working. I was feeling 
alienated behind the counter. I 
couldn ' t speak Hungarian . 
Also, the whole mid-town -
Manhatten·during -Christmas· 
rush scene was really getting 
me down. I began to experience 
anxiety attacks every time I got 
on a crowded sidewalk . This 
was making it somewhat 
difficult to get to work. 

What was bothering me most 
was that these things - the 
crowds, the traffic, the noise 
and filth - didn't seen to be 
fazing anyone else. In fact , they 
all rather seemed to be 
enjoying it. " This place is 
insane , it 's a zoo, it's a 
madhouse . Who would ever 
want to live here?" I kept 
telling my mother. 8pe just 
looked at me funny. Nobody 
seemed to understand. 

One afternoon after I had quit 
my job my grandmother and I 
went to see a movie which was 
about liCe on Malibu beach . I've 
always enjoyed excursions 
with my Grandmother im-
mensely. "Grammy! " I 
shouted. " That's what it looks 
like, that 's what California 
looks like!! That's just the way 
it looks!! ,. She was asleep. 

In a final burst of energy , I 
made a tour-de-force of the 
city . I saw seven movies , a 
Broadway play, four or five 
mu urn exhibitions, heard a 
concert at Lin oln Center, and 
ate at some fancy re taurants 
- and the whole time I was 
miserable. I couldn' t find a 
pool. 1 gue s my needs are 

pretty simple. 
A typical example of 

idio'lyncratic behavior in New 
York . On New Year 's Eve I 
went to a party with some old 
friends on Long Island. I spent a 
good part of the evening 
listening to this guy talk about 
his old neighborhood in 
Brooklyn. "We had to move to 
Long Island, " he said in a welJ-
rehearsed tone of disgust as he 
described the size and color of 
his grandfather's jaw while he 
was in ' the hospital re -
cuperating. from being 
mugged, "But I still love 
Brooklyn . " You've got to 
develop a sense of humor. 

You know, it's pretty difficult 
to generalize about two million 
people, but it seems that as a 
rule New Yorkers don't know 
how to relax and enjoy things . 
They are too busy having a 
nervous breakdown . Have you 
ever ridden a New York City 
subway (which is, ir you can 
believe it, dirtier, and more 
crowded, than the UCSD pool at 
.j ; 15 on a weekday afternoon) . 
(t' s proof of the number of New 
Yorkers who have already gone 
ocr the 'deep end . In New York, 
'·mellow" conjures up images 
of the notorious "West Coast 
Airhead" (Paul Simon in 
'·Annie Hall") and "kick-back" 
is synonymous with lazy. There 
are very few blonds. I like it out 
here . 

When all is sajd and done, I 
guess it's pretty important not 
too take liCe too seriously. 
Unfortunately some situations 
don 't seem all that funny, but 
you force it just to make 
yourself feel better. For 
example, about two weeks ago 
my mother had her purse 
snatched from her arm while 
she was making a telephone 
call in Grand Central station. 
In LI family meeting later that 
night we had the obligatory 
grim luugh of approximately 
five seconds apiece and then 
chunged all the locks on the 
doors. The thier later rang up

Colorado-based Coors brewery. 
Their positions were per-
manently filled by scabs in the 
Colorado area. 

Said Cadwallader. "the 
Coors employees went.on strike 
not because of money. They 
were well paid. They struc.k 
over the human rights issue." 
T le employees raised strong 
objections to such Coors 
policies as : mandatory lie 
detector tests. and dismissal 
due to " conduct against the 
morality of the community. " 

" Two years ago. approxi-
mately 1400 workers at the 
Colorado Brewery walked off 
their jobs." said David Harris 
of CALPIRG. The strike was 
'organized by local 366. which 
has since been decertified. Of 
the 1400 original strikers. only 
four hundred still remain on 
strike. " The other thousand 
have either found other jobs or 
went back to work at Coors." 
sa id Ha rris. 

According to Cadwa Hader, 
both the AFL-CIO a nd the 
Teamsters have lent their sup-
port to the boycott, which has 
produced a s ubstantij:l l drop in 
the sales of Coors beer 
in the state of California. 
"Sa les have dropped from 
thirty -eig ht to tw e nty -
five perc e nt of t he 
m a rket ." According to 

a dw a l\ a der , the strikers-
turned-boycotters are now 
attempting to " bring Coors to 
its knee ," explaining that, 
" the boycott may be the only

way for the labor foree to deal 
with Coors." 

Often cited by boycott groups 
as a violation of employee 
rights by the Coors company is 
the company's practice of 
administering of pre- em-
ployment polygraph tests. 
Labeled by Cadwallader as 
"unconstitutional and un-
ethical," the questions asked 
during the tests include : 
-did you tell the complete 
truth on the Employment 
Application? 
-have you ever used any (orm 
of illegal drug or narcotic on the 
job? 
- has the use of alcohol 
frequently impaired your 
ability to perform on the job? 
-a re you concealing any 
information about subsersive, 
revolutiooary, or Communistic 
activity? 
-are you applying for a job 
with this company so you can do 
it or any of its employees 

harm? 
- are you presently wanted by 
the authorities for a felony? 
- have you every stolen any 
kind of merchandise, material, 
or money from an employer? 

Pre-employment polygraph 
tests are illegal in the 'state of 
California, but Colorado pre-
employment polygraphs are 
within the law. 

At the Open Forum, to be held 
at I pm this Monday, two public 
I'elations representatives from 
Coors will answer questions 
irom the audience. 

A third Coors representative 
who was originally scheduled to 
be present at the Forum has 
informed KSDT that he will not 
be in attendance. 

Also present at the Forum 
will be two local 366 Union 
officials who will answer 
audience questions , and 
themselves question the Coors 
representatives.

A bus stop where the # 36 bus 
used to pick up SDSU students

the press conference, which 
featu red denunciations of the 
San Diego City Council. 

Ernest McCray, a member of 
the steering committee of the 
coalition , led the crowd in a 
cheer , a nd later a song . " The

The group is seeking funds

They appeared before the 
council Monday and Tuesday of 
this wee.k to fight the proposed 
hiring of 100 new police officers. 

The council continued the 
issue to their Feb. 13 meeting, 
and coalition member s 
promised to be there to present 
their views. 

McCray said the coalition is 
thinking about making other 
possible cuts in the city budget. 

" We're doing as much 
research and community 
organizing as we can," he said. 

According to Rob DeKoven, 
executive vice-president of the 
AS at SDSU. top . aides to 
Councilmen Tom Gade and Bill 
Mitchell ·were to be the key 
speakers, . at the rally , but 
called today to say they could

" This is an issue they just 
don ' t want to touch, I guess," 
DeKoven said. 

DeKoven, who organized the 
20-minute press conference, 
said all the councilmen were 
invited. 

SDSU students who formerly 
rode the 36 line have found 
oth~r ways to make the trip, 
according to DeKoven. 

"F~r some of them it takes 
twice as long," he said. 

The AS is working on a 
possible "Bug Line" commuter 
bus from SDSU to the beaches, 
in case the 80 line is cancelled.

Barry Cunningham, head

resignation Monday in a leiter 
to Intercollegiate Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet, ef(ective 
at the end of the 1978-79 season .

-Cunningham will remain with 
ttJ.e. P hy sica lEd uca t i on 
Department in a teaching 
capacity. . 

Cunningham cited several 
reasons for leaving the head 
coach position, among them his 
own frustrations with the UCSD 
athletic philosophy. in 
particular the basketball 
program. 

Cunningham has already 
been offered and accepted a 
consultant job at a Division I 
basketball program in the city . 
He won't say which school, but 
Division I schools include 
SDSU, USIU , and USD. 

In a letter to Sweet dated 
January 16 and received by 
Sweet on Monday, Cunningham 
said that " under the present 
circumstances I don't need/the 
agony and frustration off the 
court that coaching here gives 
me. " The coach referred to the 
UCSD (arrangement) as a 
" glorified intramural pro-
gram" with a "Cal Tech type 
atmosphere. ,. Cunningham has 
been disgruntled with the low 
funding and priority placed on 

the program. 
"I wrote the letter earlier in 

January and did not intend to 
send it until later in the 
season," Cunningham re-
marked. " However, the straw 
that broke the camel's back 
was when my request for a 
carry-all to take support staff of 
the basketball team (timers, 
nporters, etc.) to Los Angeles 
on Tuesday night was denied." 

Cunningham "did not handle 
the request for a university 
vehicle in accordance with the 
special procedures needed to 
get an allocation from outside 
the basketball team's regular 
budget," according to Sweet, 
explaining why Cunningham's 
request was denied. 

" I don't think my decision to 
resign will affect the team," the 
coach remarked. Almost all the 
guys knew I would eventually 
resign. I feef relieved in one 
sense now that I've done it , yet 
a lso sad and disappointed to ~e 
12 years of association with the 
UC intercollegiate athletic 
program come to nothing. " 

Cunningham doesn't feel that 
the program is "one ounce 
better than when I started. We 
haven 't made any advance-
ments in the 9 years I've served 
a coach." The highlights of 
Cunningham·s UCSD coaching 
career were when the 1968-69 
squad up et third-ranked UC 
Riverside. The 1974-75 team 
adva nced to the national play-

oHs with a 13-13 record. 
In resigning, Cunningham 

also cited a lack of funds for an 
assistant basketball coach, no 
monies for recruiti ng and 
scouti ng, a nd an unflexible 
schedule for gym practices. 
Cunningham also indicated 
that he feels "too many duties 
are placed on the coaches" 
which in his judgement are the 
" responsibilities of the athletic 
administration: namely fund-
raising and game management 
(getting timers, scorers , 
statistic ians , etc.) and 
directing basketball tourna-
ments. 

Responding toCunningham's 

remarks, Sweet pointed out 
that the "staffing and nature of 
the athletic program requires 
t hat coaches take some 
initiative and responsibility for 
contest ma nageme nt and 
special activities.·' She added 
that UCSD coaches must take 
an "acti ve role" in these areas. 

Advertisements for a new 
coach will be placed im-
mediately, Sweet said. " We 
need to find someone as soon as 
possible so we don't loose the 
continuity of our program.'" 
The new coach will have to 
recruit, schedule games for 
next season, a nd represent the 
pt:0g ra m to potentia l scholar! 
athletes.

San Diego State ' s men 's

The Tritons played hard but

In an earlier game las t week 

the tea m dropped a toug h 
match to an extremely talented 
Loyola Marymount squad, 3-0. 
Th two tea ms were a lmo t 
even throughout a ll three 
games, 15-13 , 15- 10 and 17-15 . 

··We were a head in the third

Coach Stewart feels the 

young team will have to 
everal barriers 

she is still optimistic. ' 'I'm 
looking for team cooperation 
and a winning attitude,'· she 
sa id . " Tennis depend s on 

mental awareness. ,. 

Stewart will be as isted this 
year by Becky Edles. Edles, a 
former member of San Diego 
Sta te 's tennis team, believes 
the well-rounded squa d will 
have a uccessful record this 
eason. 

" We have good depth, yet 
th ere are a few things going 
against us,·· she added . The 
primary obs tacles facing the 
te a m are the bad court 
situation a nd co nfli cting 
academic schedu les of the 
players. 

"We have only threecourts to 
use on the weekdays ," 
commented Edle . ·'This is 
becau . we have to ha re with 
the men·s team." 

Both coaches belie\·e it"s 100

he Spirit is Mighty, 
ut It Does Not Prevail 

Rah-Rahs Take Hold Just Once Every Year 
By Jon Goetz 

Senior Slaff WrilCr 
One of the biggest crowds in UCSD 

history packed themselves into the 
gym January 20 Cor the yearly Spirit 
Night basketball game. The wildly 
cheering mob, mock cheerleaders in 
drag, and improvised drum , brass 
and kazoo bands upstaged an exciting 
triple overtime victory for the Triton 
basketball team. 
- The question is : Whyi schoolspirit 

just an annual event at UCSD and not 
the dominant mood? 

The rest of the season the 
basketball players' families , friends, 
and loyal supporters will cheer on the 
Tritons, but the crowd will probably 
never again number in the thousands 
this year. 

Other teams tell the same story. 

Even the squads here with winning 
records, All-American athletes , or 
shots at the national title cannotdra w 
the support due teams at a major 
university like UCSD. 

No, the low support rate here can't 
be blamed on the teams. Perhaps, as 
Sports Information Director Henry 
DeVries theorizes , students have 
turned of( to athletics because of the 
lackluster image UCSD sports have 
developed in the past. 

"UCSD has an image of an 
academic school, not an athletic 
one," be said. "There are two 
misconceptions about sports here. 
One, that all our teams are rotten. 
Two, that there's nothing worthwhile 
to see." 

If the quality of the teams isn't the 
cause of near empty stands at 

Many more UC D students partic ipate in intramural ports than spectate at 
intercollegiate event . ","010 by SIan Ho""o 

sporting events, maybe the problem 
exists because spectating is simply a 
waste of time. 

Not so, says Howard Hunt, who has 
seen the sports program grow as a 
coach, P .E . department chairman 
and administrator throughout the 
entire history of UCSD. 

"When people come to this 
campus," he said, "they want more 
than academics," In an open house 
project with which Hunt is assisting, 
"We want to show that we have pride, 
that we can live as people and not just 
students." 

"Loyalties to a school carryover 
through life. It creates a positive 
feeling about life and about 
themselves to students ." 

Athletic Director Judy Sweet adds, 
"This .type of spirit gives students 
social activity, and a release (or their 
energy. Beyond that, itgives students 
an identity, a relating to the total 
university. There's more to an 
education than academics." 

Though spectating may be a 
valuable activity , it may just be low 
on most students' list of priorities. 
" Students are involved in a lot of 
things here ," said Sweet. 

But maybe the reason the spirit at 
athletic events isn't overwhelming is 
because more people at UCSD want to 
be on the fields , courts, tracks, a nd 
pool themselves instead of being in 
the ta nd . 

Athletes here aren't putting on u 
how , so they' ll proba bly never get 

the s upport owed them. The spectator 
has a sma ller part in UCSD athletics 
th a n the participant, a nd the 
priorities of the athletic structure 
here a re likely to keep it that way . 

Sports: An Overview 
(Continued (rom pa,ge I) 

In 1967 a referendum was held in which 
students voted agai nst implementation of 
athletic scholarships by a vote of four toone . 

" The students wanted a program that 
didn't require us buying our athletes ," Hunt 
said . " They wanted a truly a m ateur 
program." 

"All the coaches left a fter th e 
referendum, " Cunningham recalled . " They 
could see the handwriting on the wall. " 

According to Hunt, UCSD's year-old 
football team soon dissolved a fter the 
referendum. " They didn ' t want to play 
without scholarships," he said. 

PE Not Difficult to Promote 
Perhaps the most popular a pee t of 

UCSD' athletics program has been it PE 
cia ses. 

According to Hunt , a pprox imate ly ten PE 
c ia es were ava ila ble in 1965. 

" 1 was surprised when I fi rst came here," 
Hunt recalled . "There wa no credit for 
phys. ed. a nd it wasn 't ma nd ated." 

But in terest in PE c lasses was not difficult 
to promote. 

"Before computers were used," Hunt 
remarked, "students stood in line for hours 
to get the (PE) class they wanted." 

" Now," he added, " about 500 s tudents 
can't get in WE) c lasses each year. "

30, she can't afford to stay at UCSD

along with a head coaching position. 

-Soccer coach Stewart Hayes has

officiate to make ends meet. He 
admits that he can' t spend enough 
time to field a good team because he

None of these coaches would deny 
that he or she is actively seeking or 
would readily accept a full time

are but typical of the part time 
coaches at UCSD.

A similar situation exists on the 
soccer team. Stewart Hayes has 
ambitions of assisting a professional 
team or a strong college, and 
traveling overseas to attend coaching 
schools in Germany and Holland. 

':When 1 leave," he aid, "the new 
coach won't know anybody. Half of 
this job is administration, dOing the 
little things, knowing the players, 
having contacts with the referee's 
association. It was a hard thing to not 
know the players when I started here. 

"I haven't known any players to 
quit or transfer because of the 
coaching situ(ltion, but then I never 
knew anyone who came to UCSD just 
for soccer either," said Hayes. 

"Still, it's not right to promise 
things to recruits and not be here tow 
years later." 

Bill Morgan shares that feeling. He 
has laid the foundations of a strong, 
nationally competitive swim team in 
his two years here. The six to nine 
team members he expects to qualify 
for the national meet are almost all 
freshmen and sophomores. 

"We could build the program to the 
top echelon of swimming in three or 
four years. But I honestly can't S(lY 
I'll be here in three or four years. 

" It 's hard to make the commitment 
to coaching here. My loya lty to the 
swimmers is strong, but my loya lty to 
the Athletic DepJrtment is not too 
great. My wife can only support me 
for so long. 

" It will tJke a nother year of 
building the progra m before I get the 
job I want. 1 plan on being at UCSD for 
another year, " aid Morgan .

This year's women:s crew .team has been ('ailed " the best and mosl enjoyable in years" by Coach Jack 
Vallerga, The men s team IS expected to do well, also, allhough recruits an' n{'Cded, 

The "transient coach" system is 
holding back the potential of UCSD 
athletics . Is there a viable solution? 

More money is unlikely to come 
from the school. " We continue to plea 
for more money ," aid Sweet. 
" There's a Catch 22 every place we 
turn. ow there 's Prop. 13. It's like a 
little brick wall that pops up when we 
need money." 

Maybe more coaching pay wouldn ' t 
solve the problem a nyway, because 
of the great number of teams. Hayes 
comments , " You could be payi ng 
coaches a couple hundred thousand 
more a nd they still won ' t stay 10 or 15 
years . " 

The seed of olution may lie in 
private support of UCSD sports . Thi 
has been a problem in itself, becau e 
this sc hool has few a lumni , a nd fewer 
rich alumni.

Sports Success Story: 
PartiCipation Programs 

By teve Morus 
Senior lall Wriler 

Sports a t UCSD a re founded on a ingle 
concept: to encourage as m any students, 
faculty a nd staff to participate in as wide a 
variety of ports as possible. 

Furthermore . point out head coordinator 
Mike HipJ.) , Intramural provide the 
opportunity for student to participate a 
official . in the proces I' turning some of 
their Reg Fees by means of a 3.83 hourly 
wage. II togcth r , Hipp e timates close to 
65rl, of the student body participte in 
Intramurul uctll'ities alone. 

Frank Vitale, a PE s upervisor, cited two 
reasons for the interest decli ne of 
intercollegiate sports. 

" There were too many teams a nd not 
enough money ," Vitale sai d . A 
" proliferation" of teams, according to 
Vitale, crowded the demand for funds. 

Vitale also said that a "gradua l loss of 
supe r visors" af fec ted the fate of 
intercollegiate s ports. "Coaching used to be 
expected of a ll supervi sor s, " Vita le 
reca lled. " But in '73 it became voluntary." 

Women Move. Into " Men' Domain" 
Hunt's first jogging class in the 1960's 

boa ted 32 men and no women. This year, 44 
women a nd only five men are enrolled in 
Hunt's beginning conditioning class. 

" Women have come into their own , " Hunt 
sa id. "They're not being intimidate d by 
' men 's domain ' a nymore." 

INTRAMURAL TEA 
OF THE WEEK FOR REAL! 

While that does not on the urfac eem to 
be a particularly novel thought. the degree 
to which this .concept lIa b come a reality 
a t UCSD ma ke this campus' sport~ 
progra m radica ll$' different from those of 
nearly every other major university. 

The numbers a lone are impre sive. 
Together. Intercollegiate a nd Recreational 
Athletic , both officially part of the PE 
Dept. but funded complete ly by Reg Fees, 
provide pa rtici pa tion opportunities to 
Iitef<llly thousa nd of tudents, faculty (l nd 
s tMf. 

Both Hi pp and Berndes ag r e that while 
many join Intf<lmural team ju t to play 
their favorite mainstream port, the vast . 
m<ljorit see in Intramural a chance to 
sociulize . " In mo t Intramura l programs, " 
explains Bernde ,"the men' programs are 
the largest. Here, coed i the largest: that's 
defi nitely a social thing. Intramural ." he 
said. " is a focal point. a wuy to meet 
people. ,. 

" From the beginning," Vitale noled , 
" there hasn't been tha t much interest in 
intercollegiate athletics ... because of an 
emphasis on academics ." 

" But," he added, " that's no excuse ." 
Intramural Caught on Fast 

. If in ter ollegiate ports remained 
'underelT'pha ized at UCS D, intra mura ls 
quicklydev loped trong popula rity a mong 
students. 

From .he outset of campu s a thletics, Hunt 
said, th '~re wa " full participation in the 
intramu 'al program." 

" The :ir t year (of intra mura ls) ," Hunt 
recalled " there were lSI students at UCSD. 
Half of them went to our first vo lleyball 
game. " 

" The) u d to pack the gym " ut the 
volleyb< II ga mes , Vita le said. 

Hunt attributed interest in intram urJls to 
students' desire for sports participation 
instead of competition. 

" This has a lways been ," Cunningham 
remarked, "an a thletic chool a (ar a 
participation . " 

According to Hunt, half of the first 
int ramura l teams were co-ed. " We were 
ahead of the ballgame," he remarked. 

Hunt referred to an old phrase, " Horses 
s weat, men perspire , a nd women glow ." 

" It's malarchy! " Hunt exclaimed. "We 
want our women to lea rn to perspire." 

Vita le remarked that the Athletics 
Department s upported women's 
pa rticipa tion " Crom the beginning." 

When Title IX , a federa l la w mandating 
equa l fu .lding for men 's a nd women's 
sports, was implemented, CSD ha d few 
problems complyi ng with the law , Hunt 
sa id . 

Hunt said that a growth in "uttituoes in 
term of being interested in personal health 
instead of just competition" has developed 
at UCSD. 

He remarked th a t UCSD is now 
considered " th e jogging campu of 
America" a nd " has influenced the 
growth" of physical fitness in San Diego. 

" More s tudents are healthier lhan the la t 
~hree to four years," Hunt a serted . 
" because of (l new interest in diet. health . 
a nd holis ti c medici ne, speaking generally .

studio musicians (guitarist 
Larry Carlton and drummer 
Steve Gadd are only two of their 
better-known sidemen) give 
Steely Da n its clean-edged

Black. Sabbath: Depression Moderated 
By Ted Navin Burke 

Arts Editor 

A fist connected to an arm thick enough to choke a Clydesdale 
hammered th ree 

times on a door leading into a 
third-floor room at the Islandia 
Hyatt House . The knocks 
echoed through the hallway like 
war drums along the Congo in a 
Tarzan movie. 

The door opened seconds 
later, giving a glimpse of a 
naked man who 'd been 
showering. He spun around and 
sped back into the bathroom. 
Paul , the arm 's owner, told us 
that Ozzie Osborne, lead singer 
Cor Black Sabbath who were in 
town for a December 3rd 
concert at the Sports Arena, 
would be out shortly. Stan, a 
photographer, and I sat at a 
coffee table next to the room's 
balcony and sta red blankly at 
the television screen. Francis 
the TalkingMulewasgiving the 
generals of the War Depart-
ment something oC a pep 
speech, saying to the gaped-
mouthed military honchos that 

tea m spirit is required among 
the different branches if the 
" Nat-zi 's" are gonna be 
whipped. Donald O ' Conner 
cowered in the corner, his face 
a stupefied blank, perhaps a bit 
piqued at having to shelve his 
song-and-dance shtick to play 
patSY once more to this noxious 
animal. I took out a pen and 
jotted down questions for the 
interview. What does one ask a 
member of Black Sabbath ? 

At the height of their career, 
Sabbath were the undisputed 
kings of " downer rock." The 
music was, and remains still, a 
slow brand of raunch, with 
simple, lumbering chord 
progressions played through a 
distorted cacophony that 's 
been unequaled since the 
halcyon days of Blue Cheer. 

S , abbath , who achieved their first notoriety in 1968 (and who are 
celebrating their 

tenth year as a band) were a 
startling contrast to the hippie 
optimis m of the day. With the 
exception of the Velvet 
Underground and the Doors, 
they alone ventured against the 
nai ve utopias that bands like 

Ted Burke interviews Ozzie Osborne , 
""0'0 by S'.II HOMO 

the Jefferson Airplanc. the 
Moody Blues , or the Grate ful 
Dea d sang of. Sabbath 's world 
view was o£ a universe that' 
ta ken leave of its sen es, a grim 
p a r a digm of murder , 
pOintless revolution , politically 
motivated war, vengeance, 
natural disasters. Their song 
titles (" War Pigs ," " Fa iries 
Wear Boot ," " Iron Man" ) a nd 
their album titles (Paranoid, 
Masters of Reality , Technical 
Ecstasy, Sabotage and their 
latest, Never Say Die) show 
something less than the spirit of 
optimism . As could be 
expected, rock critics hated 
everything Sabbath stood for 
and have exhausted every bit of 
invective to dissuade audiences 
from patronizing them. But 
rather than be put of[, the 
young rock crowd was instantly 
enamored of S a bbath ' s 
doomsday persona, giving the 
band several best-selling 
albums and sell-out American 
tours . Other rockers have 
jumped onto S a bb at h 's 
profitable grim-visage (Alice 
Cooper, Blue Oyster Cult) a nd 
have made good money a t 
telling their fa ns tha t the world 
is going to hell. But Sabbath 
a lone have e ndured, being able 
to sustain consistently good 
sales and a loyal following. 
Where Cooper a nd Cult tended 
towards theatrics, affecta tion 
and complete showbiz , Sa bbath 
were a lways to th e point . 
However drea r y S a bba th ' 
postula tion ha ve been, they 
ha ve rarely. if ever , been 
pompou . llrrogant or over ly 
preachy. A it comes through 
Ozzie Osborne's near-a tona l

Young made his singing

he sang a medley of Harvard 
fight songs, accompanied by a n 
accordian player , at the 
reunion of the Harvard class of 
'25. Young's father and brother 
were Harvard graduates and 
his uncle was dean of the Yale 

graduate school. Young was 
being groomed for an ivy

Greenwich Village, cut his first 
a lbum in 1964 and signed to sing 
at one of Cambridge's leading 
folk clubs . He played the Boston

little bit too much like Elvis for 
the likes of Boston folkies."

Every Way 
But Good 
For Clint 

By Beth Accomand~ 
Staff Wrller 

During the forties and fifties , 
a film genre known as the B 
movies evolved and gained 
prominence. These films , ma de 
especially as co-features, were 
characterized by cardboard 
individuals, h ac kneyed 
situatio n s and a mateur 
production s tyles. A modern 
example of this genre is Clint 

.Eastwood's latest film Every 
Which Way But Loose which 
has all the earmarks of a B 
movie except that Warner 
Bros. is trying to pass it off as a 
feature rilm of worth. 

]n Every Which Way But 
Loose Eastwood plays Philo 
Beddoe, a s tereotypical heart-
of-go ld , brawn-but-no-brains 
tough guy who makes a living 
picking fights . The story, which 
drift a round for an hour before 
eWing on a cour e , centers on 

Philo' pursuit of a country· 
western singer who ditched 
him. While on his earch Philo

Thirty Gather Protest Vending Transfer 
By Jen Beresford-Howe 
A .. ociale Manallne Editor 

A crowd of about thirty 
students, including repre-
sentatives from each of the 
college governments. gathered 
at Wednesday night 's AS 
Council meeting to protest last 
summer's reallocation of 
vending machine funds . 

Led by Muir House Advisors 
Andy Schneider and Zephyr 
Goldsmith , the protesters 
blasted the administration's 
decision last August to transfer 
vending machine income from 
each of the colleges to the 
Housing and Food Services 
Administration. 

Vending machine funds 
finance nume rous college 
activities, including Third's 
Cultural Awareness Day, the 
Warren Student government, 

. Muir Special Projects majors, 

the Outback Cafe a nd the 
Center for the People. The 
decision to tra nsfer the funds to 
Housing takes effect July 1. 

Nancy Laga , Revelle AS 
Representative , ha s been 
pushing the issue since last 
quarter , and provided an 
analysis of the vending 
machine conflict. 

Goldsmith charged that the 
reallocation "takes away the 
freedom oC college councils to 
act as separate colleges " 
because of what Goldsmith 
believes will be a college 
dependence on the Reg Fee 
committee aCter the transfer. 

Schneider accused the 
administration of transferring 
the funds to compensate forbad 
management in Housing and 
Food Services. The Coffee Hut, 
Winzer Commons and Scripps 
C~feteria are big money losers, 

he said, but Housing and '}o'ood 
services has been reluctant to 
close them becau of their 
service to faculty a nd talC, 

Schneider also charged that 
the transfer to the Reg Fee 
committee of much of college 
progra mming might neces-
sitate a fee increase, a nd asked 
the Council to take action "and 
make an a dministrative 
decision." 

$chneider urged AS Presi-
dent John Jenkel to start 
registering protests with the 
administration on the vending 
machine issue. 

Herman Johnson, Vice Chan-
cellor of Financial Manage-
ment , reached yesterday. said 
that provisions have already 
bet!n made in the adminis-
tration to cover lost vending 
machine revenue for the 
colleges for the next two years, 

Sabbath Band Member: 
We're Just a Counterpoint 
(Continued from page II) 
slagged for being Satanists, 
baby eaters, revolutiona ries, 
all manner of strange blokes, 
and that'a har~lIy it a t a ll. We 
were singing about how th 
world actually is, always ha 
been, y'know? I mean, when 
Sabbath was first starting, we 
had to play under horrible 
conditions, in dirty cramped 
clubs in the slum parts of town 
a nd we' ve had to put up with 
bad crowds, drunks, toughs, 
junkies, ripoff assholes and hit 
like that. a nd when you come 
out of a scene like th at, a nd 
you're writing your own songs 
and all, it's only natural that 
you express what you know 
about what's around you . Our 
words came out of our 
experience. We couldn 't tell 
people who came to see us in 
concert that the world was a 
beautiful place, y'know, we 
couldn ' t s ing about flowers, 
love and peace. I mean , I 
couldn ' t sing shit like that to 
some bloke puking his guts out 
in the gutter , could I ? 
Besides .. ," Osborne laughed 
a nd stood up , " ... tha t kind of 
s tuff wouldn't cut it in a Black 
Sabbath song, .. " 

e croonea tne first H bars of " Iron Man ," their largest Ameri-
can hit , and sang the 

first bars of John Denver's 
" Take Me Home Country 
Roads ." He laughed again and 
retook his seat. "Y' ee," he 
continued, " poetry d~sn't go 
with a Black Sabbath tune. The 
lyrics th at Geezer (Butler , 
bassist) writes a nd that I sing 
would be a t odds with anything 
romantic, " 

" Do you have any contempt 
for art-rock bi.lnds like Yes or 
Genesis whost! lyrics tend 
towi.lrds the religious or 
fantastic ?" I asked, hoping that 
perhaps Osborne might spew 
some caustic comments , 
Osborne shook his head, 

" Not at all.. I enjoy some or 
their music. The good thing 
about Yes and the others is that 
they tell people about the world 
as it could be. I mean, it's not 
healthy for rock audiences to 
only hear the bad side oC things, 
But when Sabbath came out, 
there wa a lot of thal stuff 
around already and we didn ' t 
fit into it. We had to be honest 
and call things as we Celt 
them." 

S tiln broke the 1lI0mt!n-tilry s ilence. " Whi.lt do you think of the 
, punk 1'0 'k move -

mcn!'!" Osborn' sal i.lgain on 

the bed and reached over to 
tu rn the television et back 'on, 
sound off. 

.. ot a whole lot ," he said. " I 
mean , I really haven' t exposed 
my elf to it a whole lot, so I 
rea lly can ' t ay, but wha t I 
have heard didn' t impress mea 
who le lot. 1t:s too bas ic, rea lly, 
too fuc king s imple-minded. ) 
mean , they had a point -to make, 
one point really. a nd now thi.lt 
they 've made it, they really 
don't know what to do. As a 
movement. punk rockers have 
a good idea. It 's a strong 
movement among a lot oC 
rockers bored with all the 
commercial shit they get on the 
radio. I like that idea a lot. But 
the New Waver hasn' t put much 
thought into the music itself, 
which is the thing that really 
tells t he worth of a n y 
movement. It's more tha n 
attitude. The power of any 
movement to effect a nything 
depends in the qua lity of the 
things it produces. Ta ke the 
flower-power hippie move-
ment. From the Love Genera-

tion there was a lot oC excellent , 
exciting music that came out of 
it a nd it sti ll stands up today. 
Like the Beatles. Those guys 
changed the world with their 
music. There were kid in 
Taiw a n wearing Be atie 
haircuts and si nging the word 
in English . (n the Soviet nion 
too. Flower-power cau ed a 
revolution th a t wa fell 
throughout the world. It was a 
beautiful t hing until The 
Machine - I mea n the mus ic 
business, the Media - got a hold 
of it a nd turned it into 
something meaningle s, like 
hamburgers. The real hippies 
just took off to do their own 
thing while a ll the fake came 
in a nd started making fuc king 
money off of it ... " 

The conversation drifted 
through several topics, s uc h as 
Walt Disney (" Mickey Mouse 
was the greatest th ing to 
happen to the planet si nce 
Jes us Christ" ), rock c riti cs 
(" After ten years of being 
sla gged in the press, they ' ve 
rea lized tt.ill Black Sabbath is

(Continued from page Z) 
$1900.00 worth of bills on my 
mother's canceled visa card. 
Earlier, in the fall . the New 
York Times went on strike for 
three months. Although this 
threatened to summarily end 
all breakfast, dinner, a nd 
evening conversation at home. 
everyone made the best of it: 
my Dad found a news radio 
station (and they wonder why 
the lectric bill was so high?) 

And then backtracking to the 
summer of 1978 there was the 
la t swim which I took on an . 
east-coast beach (Rye Beach, 
Playland). It was mobbed, butl 
was determined to take a swim. 
I'm a firm believer that 
suffering builds character. So 
sidestepping piles of blankets, 
bodies, a nd overflowing 
garbage pails. I made my way 
to the water. No joke - it was a

had never seen anything like it 
before. 

Well. I was about neck high. 
navigating my ~ay in between 
(Joating paper cups, and 
contemplating a co ld (er) 
shower at home. when I had the 
misfortune to have a close 
encounter of the worst kind : 
with a hermetically sealed 
troja n. I opened it up a nd filled 
it with water. Tpe estranged 
owner was no less than two feet 
to my left, watching. I'm still 
reliving the embarrassment of 
those few seconds in between 
when I first SllW him and when I 
finlllly reached my towel on the 
beach.

Major 
Decision 
(Conlinued from page 1) 
"eating up extnl resources ... 
The CEP is supposed to be only 
concerned with the academic 
program, but in the back-
ground are more concerned 
with resources." 

The Communications pro-
gram submitted a preliminary 
proposa l to the CEP, in which 
further problems were cited. 
According to a letter written by 
Cole to the CEP, the current 
program revisions center on: 

-c1arifyi ng the genera I 
requirements for the major 

- pre- requisite courses from 
outside Communications 

- the specific role and 
structure of cross-listed 
courses . 
"Whether the major is passed 
or not, everyo ne who is 
presently a Communications 
major will be able to continue to 
finish," said Orale.

Auto Theft Wave Hits Campus 
By S e Morus 

Senlot ff Writer 
In respon to the bur-

glarizing of at least 13 cars 
while they were parked along 
North Torrey Pines Road or in 
Revelle parking lots last 
Tuesday night, a vigilante 
group has formed. according to 
students who were robbed. 

Reports filed with City 
Police. who have jurisdiction 
along non-campus roads. state 
that an unknown number of 
assailants gained entrance to 
the cars after smashing their 

The 

right passenger windows. in 
most cases making 0(( with 
tapes. tape decks. speakers, 
and tool sets. Apparently the 
thieves acted quickly and with 
precision, robbing only newer 
cars or those with valuables 
plainly in sight. 

Although no complaints have 
been filed with Campus Police. 
students working on their 
damaged cars have reported 
being approa ched by three or 
four other tudents carrying a 
machete and a length of chain, 
demanding to see the car"s
