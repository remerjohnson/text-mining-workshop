Committee proposes 
$128 quarterly reg 
fee for 1979-80 

by Steve Gould 
A proposal to increase Registration Fees by $3 per qua rter 

effective for the 1979-80 academic year has been submitted by the 
Advisory Committee on Student Fee Programs to Chancellor 
McElroy. 

If approved by the Chancellor, Reg Fees will climb to $128 per 
quarter, as opposed to the $120 in the current school year. The Reg 
Fee Committee has already pushed through a $5 per quarter hike 
for the upcoming ye~r. 

According to Marsha Harris, Reg Fee student co-chair, the 
increase was mandated by the University of California Board of 
Regent because the Reg Fee systems reserve at UCSD dropped to 
$40,000 at the beginning of this school year. 

" We must make the students pay enough to keep up a decent 
reserve and pay for incidental program increases," Harris stated. 
She cited the Day Care Center and deans offices as part of the 
increases. 

Increase a must 
Rick Whitehill, Associate Vice-chancellor of Student Affairs and 

adminisir..atille..-eo-chair of the Reg Fee Committee, said the 
motive behind the increase is obviou . " If you want to maintain 
services and have no increase 
in the number of students at 
UCSD, we must cover inflation-
arx measures," said Whitehill . 

'You're talking abut a four 
percent increase in 1978-79 and 
about a three percent increase 
in the following year ," he 
added . '! If you compare these 
wi th t'h e norm a l r a t e of

hopefully raise the system 's 
reserve to 350,000 by the end of 
the 1979-80 chool year. Harris 
pointed out, " Depending on the 
budgetary savings target, we 
will have $350,000. If we do not 
hold to the budget, we will have 
$300.000. " (Please turn to page 3)

Howard Hunt looks back with relish 
Howard Hunt departed from 

his job as Vice-chancellor of 
Student Affairs in the same 
manner that he entered 13 
months ago - with a smile. 

Asked by Chancellor Mc-
Elroy in May of 1977 to be the 
interim Vice-chancellor of 
Student Affairs until a perma-
nent candidate could be found, 
Hunt has remained in the post 
until his replacement yester-
'tl:lY by Richard Armitage. 

Catchi ng Hunt in his last 
. minute on the lob found him in 
a reflective mood , various 
q~estions causing long reminis-
ClOg. Perhaps most evident in 
Hunt was his overall sense of 
pride - a pride he shared with 
"all those who had worked him 
in Student Affairs." 

" We can look back and say 
we met our responsibility in 
developing a reserve fund ," 
aid Hunt. " We're very pleased 

to have stuck to our guns and in 
so doing have a reserve of 

$250,000 for the difficult times 
ahead. I've been told that our 
department is more fiscally 
sound than any other campus in 
the University of California 
which makes me feel very 
good." 

An "even keel" 
Hunt said that he pictured his 

own role as "keeping an even 
keel " in preparing for his 
ultimate successor. In trying to 
do suc h , Hunt worked for 
actions "important to the 
future", such as helping to 
institute the opening of Future 
Foods (and ultimately the beer 
pub) as well as seeing to a 
sound student government. 

" The only reason for any of us 
to be here is because we serve 
10,000 students," said Hunt, 
adding that, "As long as 
students express themselves 
they will get things accom-
plished." 

Through his job of Chairman 
of the Physical Education 

Department (which he has now 
returned to) prepared him in 
many ways for the Vice-
chancellor's position, it took 
Hunt some months " to get a 
firm footing ." 

"Early in the ballgame I 
found out it takes more than an 
unilateral decision , and that I 
should con ult with the Reg Fee 
Committee ," said Hunt , 
alluding to his fall quarter 
troubles with the committee 
over funds he had allocated 
which had previously been 
earmarked to be saved. 

Leaning the rope 
"It wa a matter of learning 

the ropes and having some 
highJy qualified people advi -
ing me which in time made me 
feel confident about the job," 
said Hunt . " I now know a 
number of things I would do if I 
stayed on the job, and to thi 
end I will be con ulting with 
Armitage until June 30." 

Primary on Hunt' list of 

things " I would ha ve gotten 
to, " i a development of 
University Events so as to 
better olidify and organize 
variu campu activitie . 

Hunt's enthu iasm forthejob 
appears to have remained 
unflagging despite the inherent 
pr sure in the work. 

" It wa a real challenge," 
aid Hunt. " The job even taught 

an old dog like me new trick . It 
spurred a great deal of 
individual growth." 

But what about the negative 
factors? 

"Well, there are the long 
hours," aid Hunt. " And when 
you are ina position of 
responsibility you will be hot 
at. Sometimes thes challenge

Next Tuesday C ICornia Republicans will almost surely elect 
either Evelle Youn,er or Ed Davis as their party's nominee for 
Governor. . 

When that happens, state Republicaps will once again 
demonstrate their famous death wish. 

The California Republican Party is dominated by people from 
some political stone age - unreconstructed supporters of Barry 
Goldwater, Richard Nixon and Ronald Regan. As a consequence, 
in state Republican primaries, the candidates often fall over each 
other trying to prove which is farthest to the right end of the 
political spectrum. 

Republican candidates who, on the other hand, attempt to show 
that they can appeal to a broad range of voters, both Republicans 
and Democrats, don't usually stand a snowball ' s chance in hell of 
winning. 

Of course, far right candidates can almost never win in the 
general elections, especially when they are Republicl,lns running 
in a state in which Democrats hold a two-ta-one registration edge. 
To win in just about any district in the state, a Republican needs to 
attract large numbers of Democrats and independents. 

Tell that to California Republicans. Pete Wilson or Ken Maddy 
- as they have established themselves as political moderates who 
could give Jerry Brown a tough time in November - should 
logically be the Republican's choice. 

The dull Younger - currently the favorite of pollsters - would 
have a tough time keeping up with the charismatic Brown in the 
media campaign that will ensue. Davis has never pulled closer 
than 20 percentage points o£ Brown in the polls - and once Brown's 
media team gets through publicizing Davis' issue stands, the race 
shouldn't get a whole lot closer. 

But it's typical for Republicans - both in California and 
nationally - to go for ideologically pure candidates over persons 
who could win. In 1974, for instance, some state Republicans were 
slow to get behind Hugh Flournoy's gubernatorial campaign 
because they considered him too moderate. Flournoy lost by only 
two percent. 

In 1968, national Republicans rejected Nelson Rockefeller for 
their presidential candidate in favor of Richard Nixon, even 
though Rockefeller probably would have gained huge numbers of 
crossover Democratic votes against Hubert Humphrey. 

..... 

Originally, it appeared Proposition 13 - the Jarvis-Gann 
property tax limitation initiative - might be defeated in next 
Tuesday's election . After all, in California there are enough public 
employees and special interest groups dependent on public money 
to defeat anything, if they band together, right? 

Apparently not. A whole lot of special interest groups have come 
out against Prop 13 in a very well financed media campaign. But 
this campaign has apparently been beaten back by a combination 
of factors, including: 

-The very recent release of this year's property tax 
reassessments, many of which had been hiked drastically . 

-Los Angeles County Tax Assessor Alexander Pope 's rollback 
of many of this year's LA reassessments. 

- The simplicity of Prop 13 compared to the complexity of Prop 
8, the state Legislature's alternative to Jarvis-Gann. Prop 13 says, 
simply, that taxes will be cut. It doesn't worry about how this will 
be done . 

Prop 8, on the other hand, is complex because the problem it is 
addressing is complex. The Legislature put together a package 
that tries to give much needed property tax relief without 
dismantling the state's financial structure - which is what Prop 
13 may well do. 

Support for Prop 13 represents the latest step in an ominous 
trend in California voting that began to show with voter rejection 
of the Farmworker Nuclear limitation initiatives in 1976. I( this 
trend continues, things could get rough in " laid·back" California,

Voices from past: UCSD athletics ok 
Editor: 

Since your May 24 columns are 
loaded with hints that UCSO should 
mount more ambitious programs in 
intercollegiate athletics, I think it 
worth your space to reprint the 
following letter, sent to and printed 
in the Triton Times some years ago. 

The signatories were members of 
the Uepartment of Literature who 
had at one Umeor another taughtat 
Ohio State. The "Ham" referred to 
is the late Tom Ham. a generous 
man, one of the founders of the 
Honorary Alumni organization at 
UCSO, who had mouned a small 
campaign fOl" bigger-time athletics 
here, a campaign of the sort that 

seems to be in the process of being 
mounted again. 

ROY HARVEY PEARCE 
Professor of American Literature 

Editor: 
As former members of the 

faculty of The Ohio State Univer-
sity, we have observed at firsthand 
what is involved in "a program of 
big-time athletics" (to quote Mr. 
Tom Ham) and the subsidization of 
athletes which such a program 
necessitates - a continulJusly 
inflating expenditure of funds to 
insure that the university indeed 
keeps in the big time. At Ohio State 
- as at all universities with· big 
time programs - there was, and is, 
a complicated and ex'pensive 

Student turnout of 
more than 50/0 necessary 
Editor: 

A low student voter turnout is not unusual. In last November'sSan Diego 
City General Election, several precincts of UCSD has some of the lowest 
voter turnouts in the city. 

According to information on file at the San Diego County Registrar of 
Voters, precinct no. 12004 (Muir College dorms) had 586 eligible voters on 
the rolls. Of these, ONLY 30 persons voted (5.10/0).. Consolidated preCincts 
no. 12005 and no. 12006 (Revelle and Warren College) had a total of 620 
eligible voters on the rolls ; again ONLY 30 persons voted (4.8%). In 
contrast, the percent turnout for the city of San Diego as a whole was 37.9%. 
None of these percentages renect any great sen e of civic duty. 

It will be in the students' best interests not only to vote onJune6, but also 
to vote against Proposition 13. Likely consequences of the approval of 
Proposition 13 are the following: 

1. An increase in the sales tax. 
2. An increase in university fees . 
3. No tax relief for renters. 
Thus, I believe that every student should make every effort to vote on 

June 6.

appartus of athletic scholarships, 
special board and room arrange· 
ments, pocket money, a coach-
athlete ratio considerably lower 
than the faculty·student ratio, vast 
expenditures for equipment. etc., 
etc. There was a period when not 
only athletes got special tutorial 
help with their studies but when the 
wives of freshmen coaches were 
writing papers for athletes too bUlly 
getting in shape to do their own 
writing. The great Woodrow Wilson 
Hayes stopped all this; he even 
threw off the football team and 
publicly denounced a most 
promising halfback caught 
cheating the fourth time. He taught 
his players that they had to keep 
thei r G P As up, or else they wouldn't 
get to play football and would miss 
out on the proCessional careers 
toward which they were aiming. 
When the OSU Faculty Council 
decided thatOSU shouldn'tgo to the 
Rose Bowl twice in a row, there 
were massive student riots 
whipped up by the Columbus 
newspapers . Questions as to the 
relevance of big time athletics to 
the university's mission became 
irrelevant, because OSU was in the 
big time and couldn't afford to get 
out. Meantime, athletes played out 
their four years - or five or six if 
they were redshirted - and Cor the 
most part didn't botherto graduate, 
unless they weren 't drafted by the 
pros and were compelled to go into 
high school coaching, with a little 
teaching of EngUsh and history on 
the side. And there was always the 
hope of college coaching - with so

being.

Editor: 
I am still reeling from the beatings I took on May 22 and 24, the respective 

dates on which Jack Behar and Steve Sheperd answered my letter of May 
12. I was able to survi ve the barrage only because most of the blows were 
glancing and had nothing whatever to do with my letter. In fact, if J hadn't 
reread the pieces several times, and recognized my name, I might have 
assumed Behar and Sheperd were attacking someone else's letter. 

I really should apologize for one thing. I was hasty in criticizing Dr. 
Behar's teaching slyle because, the way my letter was so badly misread 
and blown out of context, it appears I should have started out with more 
modest beginnings; like lessons in reading comprehension! 

Lesson Number One: reread my first letter. (It's in English.) Nowhere 
did I insinuate that Dr. Behar would answer criticism with unfair grading. 
I suggested that no ODe had approached him " because of the feared 
consequences: harsh'!r grading. etc." It is a truth that students fear for 
their grades and are I.e.itant to do anything they feel might damage those 
grades. Whether or n. t those fears are warranted is another problem. The 
fact is, their fears do exist and that helps explain why Dr. B har, or any 
other professor, hear:: ry little directeriticism from students. There was 
no per onal. landen us insinuation about Dr. Behar. He cho e to accept 
th observation as one Bnd it clouded his answer. 

Secondly , Dr. B h: 'r defend hill "s~u",pticn that ,tudenlJi have read 
Bssigned novels . Aga n,. he mi read my letter, for I did not attack a fair 
assumption of that sert. What I criticized was the unfair assumption that 
all students had read .l vel BEFORE it wa a signed. oreven that we had 
finished it only two d after the book was assigned . 

Th day I complained about hi giving away the ending of Conrad's 
novel, his excuse that ~e assumed that everyone had read th book was 
simply untrue. As I .lid in my first letter, he could not have assumed the 
cla s had read th book sine he was advising us on how to go about reading 
it. 

He writes about my curtness and grimness; ,. (it) took the form of his 
telling me that there J had gone and done it again." So that there will be no 
mistake about it, I would like to say, "Dr. Behar, there you've gon and 
don it again! You published the ending of The ret Ag n1 in the Triton 
Times for the whol campu to e. Undoubtedly, some of the pleasure of 
reading the booki now 10 t to a few students who will read Conrad, notonly 
(or th " finer pleasure " of the intell ct, but also for th (pi a forgive 
m ) "ba r pleasure "of he r njovm nt. Even your devoted dlscipl 
Stevp Sh perd, is con Id rat enouj!h to disguise th endingof Haml t with 

asterisks, for the sake of the few who may not have read it." 
And what about the rest of Sheperd's letter? Just by mentioning it, it 

already receives more attention than it deserves because his misreading 
of my letter and his insistence on .. putting words into my mouth" are even 
more pronounced than Dr. Behar's. There is one small benefit in 
discussing his letter, however, for it is a beautiful example of what to avoid 
when trying to think logically. For instance, I wrote that endings are 
important. That does not mean that endings are my "greatest thrill" as 
Sheperd insists. I wrote that one of the reasons authors arrange the order of 
novels from beginning to end, is for effect. I did not say that was the 
novelist's only concern. I said that knowing the ending prematurely would 
"adversel} affect tbe reading" of the novel. I had to smile at Sheperd's 
answer to this because he felt called upon to defend several other forms of 
art that had no bearing on the argument. Somehow, he felt my statement 
threatened all second readings of novels. And did I say there was no fun In 
seeing a movie twice? or in listening to a piece of music more than once? 
Did I say anything about plays? Jumping at those ridiculous conclusions 
must have entailed superhuman mental gymnastics. I compliment him on 
his agility, but I also suggest that he reread my letter because it pertained 
only to first readings of novels . For a lesson on how to think clearly, 
perhap he 'd care to read a little Agatha Christie? 

Th r i pleasure In studying and restudying the intellectual aspects of 
novels, but there is also a fresh , new pleasure in reading the novel {or the 
first lime. There is enjoyment in uncertainty, in suspense, in being asked to 
second· guess the author, cven in being "surprised." There hould be a 
sense of adventure in first readings and that adventure should be just as 
exciting as discovering new trends, truths , or other intellectual concerns. 
A well· rounded approach to th study of novels must allow for both style of 
reading. Are we supposed to be so far above the "virgin" reader that we 
a n completely ignore reading for pleasur ? MUlt tudying novels be so 

serious that there can be no room for a little unspoiled fun? ] would not 
dream of attacking all higher learning in literature, for to do 0 would be to 
deprive myself. I merely suggest that teaching be flexible enough to grant 
first readers in novel classe the same rights that all other contemporary 
readers po s (and po ed): To enjoy that new, pecial, exciting and 
p rsonal aulhor-reader rapport \hat ollly come with the inltJal reading. 

In fact, the problem i important nough that to "merely sugges"· a 
resolution is too w a k. 

I insi I on it. 
MICHAEL E SER 

The key, surely, is subsidization. 
And we point out that. in the crisis of 
our culture, whatever funds we 
have for subsidization should go to 
students as students, particularly 
students from exploited minority 
groups in our society . If our 
students want to participate in 
intercollegiate athletics, they 
should not only be allowed but 
encouraged to. UCSO should make 
it possible, and give them the 
necessary facilities, equipment, 
and coaching. But there should be 
no subsidization specifically set for 
athletes, nor should athletes be 
given any special treatment. 

Moreover, UCSO's right to admit 
a small percentage of its freshman 
classes students who do not quite 
qualify academically - this right 
too should be exercised not in favor 
of athletes (as is the case at some 
other UC campu es, we under· 
stand) but of minority _roup 
students who have been depnved of 
high school education equal in 
quality to that of majority group 
students. 

What do Mr . Ham and the 
"a thletic department" have In 
mind? : Tomorrow: Beat San 
Diego State! Day after tomorrow: 
Beat USC! Day alter day arter 
tomorow: Beat OSU! By that time 
we would have our own Woodrow 
Wilson H yes here. What, after all,

The California State Senate Finance Subcommittee will travel

its ramifications, Barry Hyman, AS Student Welfare

The subcommittee trip grew out of testimony ' given by Paul

Process arbitrary 
Testifying before the subcomittee simultaneously, the students 

told the Senators that the tenure process was arbitrary. except 
when predi posed against professors in interdisciplinary 
specialities such as Communications-Sociology. 

Saltman though, defended the tenure system. e told the Triton 
Times ye 'terday that he testified that, "Each (professor) is 
treated separately and uniquely on their m·erits. by a proces 
which is uniform throughout the system ." Watson says hIS own 
testimony concurred. 

The tudents also testified before the Assembly Finance 
Subcommittee May 23, arguing the same major points. Saltman 
and Watson were in Sacramento Tuesday trying to rebut earlier 
student testimony, and say they heard that the students would be 
before the Senate that afternoon. They then a. ked the Senate 
subcommittee for time to present the admini tralion viewpoint on 
tenure, and were granted it. 

The students had been invited earlier to testify by Senator John 
Stull. (Please turn to page 8)

From the 1968-69 to the 1976-77

the arrest said there were children in the yard at 
the time of the arrest. 
Susie Chavez, a day care parent, who says she 

saw the arrest, concurred with Hernandez.

yesterday morning, according to Elliot Moses, 
Assistant Chief of the Criminal Division of the

Chancellor McElroy at the Board of Regents 
meeting two weeks age (Triton Times, May 22) 
quoted McElroy as saying during the meeting, 
" We would not be disturbed if they (the City 
Attorney's office) did not press charges." The 
group also indicated McElroy said he would 
convey the message to the City Attorney. 

Witt said yesterday he told Dymally he would 
not interfere in the cases for pOlitical reasons. 
The .cases have been given to a 'deputy district 
attorney.

A very interesting note about 

this year's municipal elections 
is all the attention given to the 
judicial elections. In past 
years, these elections have 
been rather sleepy affairs, with 
little competition . But this 
year, all the judgeships are 
competitive, with many 
candidates for each one. 

One reason for this might be 
that judges are well-paid and 
get great fringe benefits. Other 
reasons might include the 
recent increased attention 
given by the media and 
politicians to the jail sentences 
given to lawbreakers and the 
apparent return to stricter law-
and-order attitudes among the 
voting public.

The thing that makes TGIF a 
success is that the film doesn't 
attempt to be something it isn't. It 
has a very limited plot. centered 
around the various activities that go 
on inside a very posh Los Angeles 
disco. While the film is hot on the

corner of Sixth and Cedar. 
Although this is my first review of

that not one of them has had the

written by David Mamet, and 
directed by Sam Woodhouse. is no 
open coffin of decaying ideas and 
embalmed sentiment. Like an 
earlier Rep show. Sam Shepard's 
The Unseen Hand, American 
Buffalo is atrociously wonderful 
and vital. 

The story is about three crusty

nature is that it really doesn ' t leave 
you with anything . except possibly 
an urge to danc . Yet TGIF didn't 
really ha ve that much goof disco

overall aura of the disco/singles 
scene. And though it probably isn 't 
fair to compare this film with 
Saturday Night Fever . the compari-

Thank God It's Friday never 
cha llenges the audience, never dares 
to explore real emotIOns. I suppose 
that makes it easier to make , yet it 
smacks of a cop-out. Still, the film 
provides decent entertainment 
without an overabundance of sex or 
violence, with only a smattering of 
drugs. And that. today. may be as big 
a dare as filmmakers care to take. j

Hard-driving .Costello to be a major star 
by Tim Mackenzie 

Arts Editor 

Concerts for the past week 
have been pretty varied. from 
the lightening licks of AI 
Dimeola to the old world sounds 
of Renaissance to the pseudo 
New Wave sounds of Elvis 
Costello. 

Costello's show at the Civic 
Theater Wednesday may just 
have been the most exciting. 
vital and energetic rock music 
I've heard in years. Costello is 
riding the crest of the New 
Wave, whatever that is, but his 
music is simple. hard-driving 
rock and roll. 

Coming on stage after good 
performances by Nick Lowe 
and Mink DeVille, Costello and 
his three piece back·up band. 
the Attractions. did not stop 
from the high energy pace, 
except for the slow love song 
"Allison." Costello. who looks 
like Woody Allen's tougher 
younger brother, performed his 
music with determination, 
rather than his well-publicized 
anger. 

The Attractions are a first-
rate band, and when combined 
with Costello's surprisingly 
satisfactory guitar work , 
created a very full sound for a 
four-piece band. Particularly 
tasty were the keyboard frills 
by Steve Naive. The show was 
obviously well rehearsed; in 
other words, very little in the 
way of improvisation. 

When Costello and friends 
left the stage and did not return 
for an encore the audience. wi th 
Abba's "S.O.S" booming over 
the souna system. stood 
applauding and would not 
leave. It was quite a while after 
the house lights came on before 
even a portion of the crowd left. 
But the indication is clear: 
Elvis Costello will be a major

star. 
Earlier in the week. Renais-

sance performed a typically 
precise. exacting set of their 
special blend of rock and Old 
English music. Though difficult 
to appreciate at the onset , 
Renaissance 's music is still 
good. Annie Halsam's vocals 
are the obvious standout , 
though the rest of the band 
performs tightly and with a 
zeal. Bassist Jon Tout provides 
the more rock n' roll part of the 
band, acting to counter balance 
the more traditional vocals. 

Though Renaissance has at 
times been accused of being 
unapproachable and too high 
browish, I found their set to be a 

Four years too late 

step forward in accessibility . 
They had some nice touches. 
including their use of fog effects 
and lights. Their music still has 
quite a limited appeal , and 
Renaissance does not appear to 
be a compromise band. Yet 
they do try to reach their 
audience as best they can inside 
their parameters. They are not 
rock n' rollers; their music is 
ethereal and pretentious. At 
worst, Renaissance provides a 
change from the usual rock 
riffs . 

Openins for Renaissance 
(and stealing the show, I might 
add) was guitarist AI Dimeola . 
Formerly with Chick Corea and 
Return To Forever. Dimeola 

brought the house down with his 
lightning-fast latin guitar riffs . 
Performing with an excellent 
band . Dimeola and Co ., 
explored various sounds with 
an unusual collection of 
percussion, and introduced a 
rock rarity; xylophone solos . 
This guy is so good and has a · 
band so tight that it may force 
Carlos Santana into an early 
retirement. Maybe. 

Note: A special New Wave 
concert featuring The Penetra-
tors will be held Sunday at 9 pm. 
Muir Commons. The bands are 
donating their share of the 
proceeds to support the sit-ins

'Coming Home' reflects reality 
by Joseph Reiner 

In an age of movies featuring 
ei ther the bloody side ~f 
telekinesis (T he Fury, The 
Chosen , etc .) or cleansed, 
romanticized period studies 
(Arneric8Jl Hot Wax, Pretty 
Baby, F.I.S.T. ). itis good tosee 
Hollywood come up with 
something that at least tended 
to reflect social reality even if it 
is about four years too late. 
Movies such as this will form 
most of the image of this era for 
those who didn 't live in it. If for 
no other reason this movie' is 
important as part of the answer 
to the question of how Holly-
wood is going to handle 
(mythologize) the Vietnam 
era. 

Coming Home is directed by 
Hal Ashby and stars Jon Voight 
as Luke, a crippled embittered 
Nam vet and 13ruce Dern as a 
gung-ho marine officer named 
Bob who returns from the war 
at the end of the film with some 
of the gung taken out of him. 
Jane Fonda plays the part of 
Bob's wife (Sa Ily) and although 
Bob is away at war for most of 
the movie, Fonda's distinctive 
sexuality does not go wasted by 
the filmmakers due to her 
involvement with Jon Voight. 
In the beginning of the film 
Sally is portrayed as a totally 
naive woman of whom her 
husband says in explaining her 
feelings about his going to war: 
" I don 't think she understands 
it but she accepts it" to which 
his marine buddy replies 
incisively, "Well , you can't ask 
for a hell of a lot more than 
that ." Thi la t comment 
obviously (if not too obviously) 
is meant to describe these 
men' attitudes a well a 
Sally·s. 

After Bob leave for war. 
Sally goes to work at the local 
V A ho pital wh re h en oun· 
ters Luke in a memorable cene 

(he runs into her on his wheel 
cart and his urine collection 
bag squirts on her as she lets 
out a horrified " oh my god. " 

~uke th~n proceeds to go into an 
Impressive-temper tantrum.) A 
relationship is set up here that 
is repeated throughout the 
movie. The men get angry and 
do things and Sally acts 
naively, tries to comfort them, 
have sex with them and says 
little to show she can think. 
While this movie shows women 
as much as men , its view 
seems slightly sexist. While I 
described the above scene in a 
sort of negative way I will say 
that it was well acted and 
involving as was most of the 
movie. It is just that I feel that 
all the characters are childish 
at some level. Bruce Dern had 
the same quality of child· like 
helplessness when he played a 
crazed vet in Black Sunday . 
Coming Home is permeated by 
a maternal viewpoint. I wonder 
if Fonda's dominance in the 
film has something to do with 
this - I don ' t know how the 
effect that we are looking up or 
down at little children is 
achieved. 

This is a pretty comfortable 
movie for the audience. No one 
is blamed for the situation the 
Vietnam veterans find them-
selves in - even though the 
situation is hown to be quite 
bad. Luke says to Bob at the end 
of the film . "There's no enemy 
here" yet that is not entirely 
true and considering Luke 's 
earlier anger it is incredible 
that he should ay that . 
Recently I talked '0 a guy who 
had been with the marines in 
Vietnam. He howed me his 
arm which wa wollen h said 
from hooting some heroin and 
amphetamine. H had ju t 
gotten divorc d from hi wife 
and wa quite 10 t . He talked 
about how Pftople now think 
"ja rh ad .. (marin ) ar hit 

and basically said things which 
mirrored the comments of 
people in the movie. The ending 
of this movie seems to neaten 
up, to suggest it's ok. After 
setting itself up as a critical 
view of ~he vet situation it 
seems to dissolve a little into a 
love story. I don ' t think the guy 
I met would have too much 
sympathy for that aspect of the 
movie. The final scene shows 
Luke talk;p.p to a high school 
audience about his anti-war 
feelings . This ending mostly 
fails because we have become 
so wrapped up in the emotional 
aspects of Bob and Luke that we 
can ' t fully a ppreciate the 
political content of what he is 
saying. This is accentuated by 
cross cuts to Bob doing 
something puzzling whIch 
interrupt Luke's scene. 

There are some good bitter 
jokes in the beginnin~ of the 
film . The movie definitel has 
its moments of honesty : A 
lovemaking scene between 
Luke and Sally was the most 
realistic one I've seen in a 
major commerical movie. a 
group of drunken partying 
marines mocking a copy of 
Desiderata ally has on the 
waU - a brief moment but very 
intelligent. 

I was moved by the film 
de pite it's errors and I think it 
is worth s~eing . I am confused 
by the mo L too, it plays with 
some very powerful feeling : 
authority .lnd allegiance 
(military. e ·ual. internal) and 
love , jealousy and hurt of 
variou kind . 'I nl movie lit 
you up by your collar and 
queeze ou a littl bit bu h n

where you were before and

Sports Remember: 
Women rowers win gold medals VOTE TUESDAY 

by Karen Hunter 
Staff Writer 

Joyce Nonaka, Toria Brad-
shaw and Colleen Kenney , all oC 
UCSD earned gold medals as 
members of the Mission Bay 
Rowing Association's flyweight 
eight in the Na.tio.nal Wo~en's 
Rowing ASSOCiatIOn Regional 
Championship Regatta last 
Saturday. UC Berkeley, Long 
Beach State and UCLA were 
among the teams competing (or 
titles. The regionals, in which 
teams Crom Oregon to San 
Diego are eligible, are held in 
the post-collegiate portion oC 

-the women's rowing season. 
" About half of the UCSD 

women's crew team decided to 
try out Cor the Mission Bay 
Rowing Association (MBRA) 
after the intercollegiate season 
ended," explained coach Jack 
Vallerga. Women from MBRA, 
San Diego State, Univer!!ity of 
San Diego and UCSD form the 
shell crews. 

" We can be selective and put 
together boats by ability. 
Obviously, we get better crews 
this way ," Vallerga remarked. 
" The team is of all-star 
cali ber." Last year at the 
national championships MBRA 
won the lightweight eight. 

Regional reps 
UCSD also had representa-

tives in other events at the 
regio nal s . Two lightweight 
eight shells were entered with a 
combined total of five girls 
from UCSD. The shells placed 
secon d and third behind 
Berkeley. The lightweight four 
rowed to a fifth place finish with 
two UCSD team members. 

UCSD's Shirley Doell, this 

year's women's team captain, 
placed second in the intermedi-
ate single scull event, behind a 
Mission Bay teammate . Doell, 
along with Sally Eggington and 
Molly McNeil , a lso students 
here, may possibly tryout for 
the national tE-am. To do this 
they mu t make the cut for the 
national training camp, to be 
announced later this month . If 
the women make the national 
team they will tour through 
Europe , endin g up in New 
Zealand in October for the 
World Championships. 

Another national hopeful is 
U CS D fre s h rna n ,' Astrid 
Holberg. Due to the fact that 
she is only 17 , Holberg is 
eligible lor the national junior 
team. Her best shot, according 
to Vallerga , is in the junior 
eight shell. 

" Astrid 's chances are 
reasonably good. She has a 
jump over other first year 
juniors since she has been 
rowing for a year at the college 
level ," commented Vallerga . A 
berth on the national junior 
squad includes a trip to the 
world championships in 

Belgrade . 
"Chance s for everybody 

from the MBRA are tough," 
Vallerga explained. "We are 
actually aiming Cor 1979. In this 
spo rt yo u ha ve to build a 
reputatioJl in order to get 
anywhere." 

Vallerga will bring his teams 
to the National Championships 
in Seattle on June 12. Competi-
tion runs from June 15-18. 

"Competition is tougher than 
last year. RadclifCe from the 
east, and BerkelE'Y and the 
University of Washington from 
the west , must be taken 
seriously."

If California voters pass 
Proposition 13 in next Tues-
day's election, there will be a 
recession in San Diego within 
two or three years, UCSD 
economics professor Walter 
Hel1er said earlier this week. 

Heller, along with fellow 
UCSD economics professors 
Richard Attiyeh and Robert 
Engle, were adding their voices 
to the growing number of 
educators against Prop 13, and 
endorsed its alternative, 
Proposition 8. 

The three faculty members 
said they studied tax rate and 
revenue figures for various 
California cities and concluded 
that passage of Prop 13 would 
cause a cut of 21 percent from 
al1 revenue sources and of 56

In other action Weanesaay 
night, the AS Council: 

• Received President John 
Jenkel's 1978-79 budget, and 
directed it to the AS Finance 
Subcomittee. That committee 
will hold hearings this after-
noon from three to four in the 
AS Conference Room, Saturday 
from nine to one in the Lounge 
Conference Room, and Monday 
from 5: 30 till completion in the 
AS Conference Room. 

• Confirmed the appointment

by authorities in behalf of a 
student who was on "the wrong 
side of law", but said that such 
things were "just part of the 
job." 

Emphasizing that the bene-
fits of the post outweighed all 
else, Hunt says he " would have 
done it all again. 

"There will be many things I 
miss," said Hunt. "Sitting in 
with the Chancel10r at the nine 
o'clock meetings and being 
involved with the day-to-day 
operations of the campus is 
certainly something 1'1111 i ' ." 

But as is Hunt' s manner, he

percent from property tax 
revenues. 

In addition, the study showed 
that San Diego would be 
affected more severely than 
other cities , the economists 
said. 

The economists said that 
while Prop 13 has been cal1ed a 
"taxpayers' revolt" by its 

supporters, Prop 8 actually 
provides more direct home-
owner tax relief. 

Prop 13 would give business a 
two-thirds property tax cut, 
and homeowners a one-third 
cut, they said. Prop 8, on the 
other hand, gives homeowners 
a 30 percent tax cut, but does 
not extend the savings to 
business. 

The choice: 13 or 8 ... 
(Continued from pale 1) 

The main difference in how 
the two propositions would 
affect state taxpayers is that 
while Prop 13 would give a 57 
percent tax cut equally to 
commercial and residential 
property owners, Prop 8's tax 
savings would go only to owner-
occupied property. 

Which would win 
If both propositions pass, a 

series of court rulings will 
probably occur, to determine 
which takes precedence. While 
the legislative counsel's office 
has said Prop 13 will go into 
effect if both win, the state 
Attorney General's office has 
said it is not sure which would 
take precedence. 

Both propositions would go 
into effect immediately, for the 
1978-79 fiscal year. 

Since Prop 13 was approved 
for the bal10t last December, 
and Prop 8 was drafted 
specifically in reaction to it, 
discussion of the two bills has 
centered around the merits of 
13, with opponents of the 
measure also trying to point out 
8's good points. . 

The major question ad-
dressed by both supporters and 
opponents of Prop 13 is what 
effect the massive tax cut it 
mandates will have on the 
system of public services now 
provided by the state and local 
municipalities. 

Prop 13 backers maintain the 
initiative will allow for 
continuation of public services 
such as schools, police and fire 
protection, while forcing 
government officials to cut 
waste from their programs and 
departments. 

Prop 13 opponents , on the 
other hand, say passage of the 
initiative will cripple pubHc 
services and cause layoffs in 
public service employment. 
Economists with the anti-13 
campaign say the initiative will 
cause at least a 20 percent 
cutback in public services. 

In addition, the opponents 
say Prop 13 will wreak havoc 
with the public school system, 
which receives a majority of its 
funding from property tax 
revenues. 

As far as UC is concerned, 
both UC President David Saxon 
and Gov. Brown have warned 
that passage of 13 may mean a 
large jump in fees an'd a 
corresponding cutback in 
available financial aids. 

Supporters answer these 
charges by saying the state 
Constitution mandates that the 
schools get the first cal1 on state 
tax revenues. 

Another . major controversy 
surroundiqg Props 13 and 8 is 
which will provide better tax 
relief for renters , who now 
comprise about half of Califor-
nia's registered voters. 

Backers of Prop 13 say their 
proposal - which does not give 
any direct relief for renters -
will nonetheless provide lasting 
relief for renters because tax 
savings for landlords will then 
trickle down to the renters in 
the form of rent cutbacks or, at 
least, no rent hikes. 

They say Prop 8 would nQt 
give renters secure savings 
because that rneasure that does 
not put any limit on future 
property reassessments. 

Prop 8 supporters, though, 
say 13, as it doesn 't give any 
direct relief to renters, is not 
good for renters. They main-
tain that landlords can't be 
trusted to pass their avings on 
to their tenants. 

Double credit 
Prop 11 , as it would double 

renters' income credit from $37 
to $75 , represents a better deal 
for renters. 

As campaigns for the two 
measures enter their final four 
days, state polls, such as the 
California Poll and the Los 
Angeles Times poll , are 
showing tha Prop 13 will pass 
with substantial voter support.
