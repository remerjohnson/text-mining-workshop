Introduction of Records into ISIS Delays Delivery of Diplomas 
By Beth Fagan 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSD student who graduated 
in Spring, 1991 received diplomas 
of degree certification from the uni-
versiry just last week, after a two-
week delay resulting from the trans-
fer of undergraduate records onto 
the Integrated Student InfOlmation 
Services (ISIS) campus-wide com-
puter network. 

At the UCSD graduation cer-
emonies in June, student. received 
Certificme of Completion , tradi-
tionally awarded in lieu ofthediplo-
mas which are sent to graduates 
only after degree approval and tran-
script processing. 

It was not until mid-September 
that some tudents noticed a lag in 

the degree po tings and mailings. 
Janny Chaiyavet, a recent Third 

College graduate, said that while 
the late receipt of her diploma did 
not affect her ability to find ajob, it 
was stressful for her and others. 

"It made an effect fin that) you 
didn 't know whether you graduated 
or not," she said. "My friend was a 
biology major. .. she got a 'D' in a 
Bio clas in herlast quarter. She had 
to wait to get her diploma to deter-
mine if he needed to [retake] the 
class." 

Coordinator of Academic 
Records Fred Atchinson explai ned 
thm the grade reports of Spring 199 1 
gnlduates were the first to be moved 
through ISIS for degree approval. 

The ma sive sy tem conversion 

which, according to Atchinson, in-
c luded "thedownloadingoftwenty-
five years worth of records," de-
layed the filing of transcripts by two 
weeks, thereby pushing the entire 
approval process back. 

Atchinson said that complaints 
from the graduate. have beenl11ini-
mal. 

"We haven't heard from too 
many students that they' re having 
too much trouble (with the delayed 
receipt of diplomas) ... we did a very 
good job to have them out by now," 
he said. 

The recent conversion and sub-
sequent delay mark the final stages 
of the ISIS project, an expansive, 
high-tech program for college man-
agement that Undergraduate Regis-

trar Ron Bowker describes u.~ "sec-
ond to none in the United State . . " 

The ISIS project originated six 
years ago when UCS D collabo-
rated with Colorado State Univer-
sity, the University of 'Michigan at 
Ann Arbor and a private vendor to 
install the program for streamlined 
student service. 

ISIS integrates infolmation for 
all billing, academic records, and 
even parkingontoamoreaccessable 
system.

for Spring, 1991 marked the begin-
ning of students ' use of the new 
computer system. However, ~tu ­

Student Regent Visits Campus to Recruit a Successor 
• Darnell speaks to UCSD students on th~ 
responsibilities, rewards of regent position 
By Paul Fotsch 
Guardian Reporter 

The UniversityofCalifomia's 
student regent spoke to a small 
group of five students yesterday 
about the process and require-
ments for becoming the student 
regent. 

Diana Darnell , agraduatestu-
dent in the Department of 
Anatomy at UC San Fr.mcisco, 
said she was here to encourage 
students to apply for the position 
of student regent and to answer 
any questions they might have 
about the position. 

Darnell said that the student 
regent has an imporant role in 
bringing a student perspective to 
the board. "It is a way students 
can have access 10 the board and 

regents can have access to students," 
she said. 

The student regent carries the 
'same weight on the UC Board of 
Regents as the other twenty-five 
members, who are in charge of de-
tennining all policy issues related to 
the nine UC campuses. 

Responsibilities include every-
thing from appointing campus chan-
cellOrs to establi!\hing admissions 
policies. Most important is theires-
tablishment of the budget for the 
University system. The regents de-
tennine where money should be 
spent and whether student fees 
should be increa-.ed to meet budget-
ary needs. 

According to Darnell, making 
decisions on the board is not easy 
because "everything comes in a big 

Student Regent Diana Darnell 
gray pot and you have to make black-
and-white decisions." 

Darnell said that although the 
student regent officially has the same 
power as the other regents, her vote

cause she doe not have a posi-
tion in a large busine. .. s or other

A.S. Co it Votes Against 
Pay Raise for Schnurer 
Ey Matt Ma~o 
Staff Wnler 

After weeh of eXlended d~b:lIc, the 
Associated ludcn!. C uncil voted lasl 
nigh( against mising Commissionerofpro-
gr.ul1ming M:llt chnurer'), stipend from 
$40 to 240. 

Thepropo al,~een origi n a ll yasmcrely 
u solution 10 Schnurer 's ituation, quickly 
expanded into a full-~cale reevalualion of 
A.S. Programming's SHU 'lure. 

Vice Preside III EXlernal Sinmak Malek, 
:lUlh I' of Ihe stipend increase proposal, 
explained that '" chnurer's resignationJ 

m~ldc obvious therc's a problem inherent 
in the programming position. 0 one 
hould take the positi n as currcntly con-

figured." 
Schnurer ngreed, saying he "wouldn ' l 

wunt 10 wish [his po. ilion] on anyone," 
addi ng that he mn for the po~ilion to 
change it. 

Concern arose reg.arding the potenlial 
financial drnincaused by indefinitely com-
pens"ling the Commissioner of Program-
ming at 600% more thnn allowed for in the 
origin~\ 1 budgetary allocat ion. 

Malek responded by calling his pro-
posal a ~hort- I~rm solulion. and a Idcd to 
hi s original bill a lime limil of . even 
weeJ.-s. 

ommls. ioner of Operations and Ser-
vices Paul Wilcox objc led, calling Ihe 

propo~'1 radically wrong. "Th problem 
is with the configuration lorlhe posilion]. 
Thisi~a totnllyinapproprimewayl I~ Ive] 
it," Wilcox ~aitl. 

Gmduate Student A~socl3lion Repre-
sentative Paul Eykamp poilllcd out Ihm 
the s;tiary propo~;' I , $12 per hour at 20 
hours per week, would, under Universily 

policy, require Ih:1I Sclll~lIrer receive ben-
efits. 

Wilcox accused Schnurer of f rcing 
the issue, saying that counci l members 
had mndeefforts ro help, but Ihm Schnul'Cr 
"rebuffedrhem."and w.lllledcouneil mem-
bers not to be "guilted into doing ollle-
thing ridicul us." 

Malek objected to Wilcox's accusa-
tions, saying that it wns not a personal 
i sue. He warned Ihecounci l that by effec-
tively forcing Schnun:r to rc~ ign. "we're 
not just puni~hing [ chnu rer l, we're pun-
ishing Ihe whole slUdent body," 

Malek also noted Ihat OClober 19. the 
date ofSchnurer 's i mended resign'llion, is 
thi Smurday. 

Eykamp noted Ihat he had heard inter-
e I in the progmmming position. 

"We won't be left wi th nothing," he 
said. 

Councilmembers ex pre sed a desire to 
resolve the issue, with Wilcox said "I'd be 
willing 10 vOle in favor [of the increase ' 
and leI [A.S. Pre. idem Agu~lrn OrozcoJ 
veto it," 

Despite obje tions from Malek, a vote 
wa~ called, and the bill failed . 

After the vote, chnlll'Cr advised Ihal 
while there are OIher~ il1lere~ l ed in Ihe

Following the tragic circumstances of the 
failed Bork nomination to the Supreme Coun 
in 1987, many thought that maners couldn' t 
get much worse. The political corruption of 
the law and the proce by which we select 
our Supreme Coun justices couldn 't pos ibly 
become more infused with special interest 
politics, personal slander, and senatorial 
misconduct than it was during the Bork 
fiasco. We had hit absolute rock bottom, 
right? 

Wrong. 
The recently completed inqui ition 

conducted into the affairs of now-confirmed 
Supreme Coun Justice Clarence Thomas 
signifies a new low in the ethical content of 
contemporary liberali m and, in particular, its 
relation to judicial "politics." 

The tragic story began with an FBI 
investigation into a single errant, and a very 
vague charge of exual harassment which 
occurred some 10 years ago. 

A sexual harassment case is normally a 
confidential malter which would be consid-
ered privately by the Senate Judiciary 
Committee and, at most, lead to a quiet, 
closed-door hearing. 

Then entered a senatorial staff assistant, 
who solicited the accuser to come forward 
with her charges on the assurance that she 
could accomplish her goal of derailing the

Once doing this, the staffer leaked the 
story to the press along with ponions of the

But wait, that's not all. This individual just 
happens to be a staff assistant to Senator

Thunday, October 17, 1991 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY 

Media Circuses Uke the Thomas Heari,. Only Divert Our Attention from Real Problems 
• Narrow focus on the part of 
the public only invites further 
government foul play 
By Gay. JohnlOl'l 
Ccntributing Opinion Writer 

"These capitalists generally act harmoni-
ously, and in concert, 10 fleece the people." 

- Abraham Lincoln, 1837 

Despite what many black organizations 
haveca\led "blatant tokenism," Oarence Th0-
mas has made the grade with both black and 
white supporters. And, token or not, Thomas 
has been through a vinual lynching over 
allegations of sexual harassment. 

Once thought of as "shining examples of 
black individuals," well-educated, crearn-of 
the-crop lawyers were pitted against each 
other in a graphic and detailed controversy, 
sending at best a negative message to women 
and young Black Americans about the integ-
rity of Blacks - educated or not. 

Of what use is such a controversy to two 
groups who are in economic and pol itical dire 
straights? Well, what we cannot use as women 
and people of color, someone else will. 

One group's trash is some other group's 
treasure, and very often this treasure is collat-
eral, used just in case wedon't buy into some 
widely accepted assumption about race,c1ass, 
orgender, keeping certain operations running 
exceptionally SJ1lO()(h. 

For those of you who have your doubts 
about there being some national conspiracy to 
sustain the powers that be,let's ju t ay this: 
those who claim oven institutionalized rac-
ism and sexism to be things of the past are, 
from a very narrow point of view, basically 
correct in their assumption. 

Yetthe blind assumption that raci m itsel f 
is a thing of the past is to underestimate the 
characterofraci m, which is constantly chang-
ing (or being changed) to firthe needs of those 
who use it. 

Overt institutionalized bigotry no longer 

means specific legislation barring certain 
groups from educational and political oppor-
tunities. 

Gender and race discrimination has 
changed to an ideal "read between the line .. 
oppression. What a breakthrough for ocial 
politics: we can't count on being called dogs 
but we can count onfeeli/1g like dogs. For 
those of you who feel a special place in your 
hean forthe kindsof gains women and people 
of color have made, take a closer look at the 
different contexts in which bigotry manife ts 
itself. 

'The reason we don't need you flaming 
rdCists and sexists to sustain hierJrchy any-
more i because an uncon cious reinforce-
ment of it in the media, educational practices 
and politics has been established for us. You 
nanle it, we've been taken in by it. 

The majority of the media, politiCS and the 
way history has been taught for so many years 
shows us constant misrepresentations of our-
selves as individual without integrity. 

LYNCHING: Uberals fail to get Thomas 
ContInued from pap 4 
stand up and pronounce his refusal to give 
validity to such scurrilous accusations? 

Of course not. 
You see, Senator Biden was al so an out-

spoken opponent of Justice Thomas. Getting 
the picture? So, after 103 days of the nomina-
tion process and on the eve of a vote on the 
appointment of Judge Thomas to the coun, 
Senator Biden opened the floor of the United 
States Senate to A~ita Hill, out ofthe blue and 
in the eleventh hour, to slander the name of 
Oarence Thomas. 

If anything at all positive can 
come from this terrible tragedy, 
maybe we'll all start to realize 

the terrible road liberal 
politicization of the judiciary has 

taken us down • .and begin to 
tum back. 

If this story leaves an uneasy feeling in 
your stomach, you're not alone . . 

The effect of this was to drag through the mud 
the name and reputation of a man whose honor, 
integrity, and character have never been chal-
lenged in over a decade of public service. 

When Judge Thomas spoke so powerfully 
on Friday and called the last two weeks of his 
life a "living hell," it wasn't that hard to 
imagine why. To have such vile things said 
about you on national television and to have 
the U.S. Senate give such garbage a credible 
forum . is a horror the rest of us can only 
imagine. 

To call the kangaroo court held by the 
Judiciary Committee over the weekend an 
inquisition or, to use the Judge's words, ". 
high-tech lynching for an uppity black" is, 

sadly, not very far from the truth. 
1llomas was subjected to a hearing with-

out even the rudimentary protections of due 
proce s. No rules of evidence, no statute of 
limitations, no nght to cross-examine, no time 
to prepare an adequate defense - none of the 
most fundamental right we accord to even 
themostvileofcriminals. Whati sadder till 
is that the American people watched this 
travesty of justice in prime time and in living 
color. 

During the "hearings," Senator Dennis 
DeConcini, a Democrat from Arizona, said 
that he was "ashamed" to be part of the 
process which took place this weekend. We 
should all be ashamed that our institutions of 
govemment have degenerated to this level. 

When the judicial system of this country 
and the integrity of its con titution are at the 
mercy of unethical clowns like Metz.enbaum 
and Kennedy, something is terribly wrong. If 
a thorough investigation into the conduct of 
Senator Metzenbaum and his staff is not con-
ducted, and - if warranted by that investiga-
tion - his censure is not forthcoming, a gross 
miscarriage of justice will have occurred. 

Additionally, the Senate should uncondi-
tionally apologize to Thomas for the disgust-
ing manner in which he has been treated by 
this process. 

Thomas said that "enough is enough" and 
that this can never be allowed to happen again. 
If anything at all positive can come from this 
terrible tragedy, maybe we'll all start to real-
ize the terrible road liberal politicization of 
the judiciary has taken us down, and begin to 
tum back. 

Thomas said that his concern was not for 
himself, but for the future of our country. Let 
us heed his words and begin to clean up this 
mess thatliberaIism has created. And where 
men like Kennedy and Metzenbaum are con-
cerned, never assume we've hit rock bottom. 

Negative self-concept i the name of the 
game and it 's played every day. If identity in 
a broad social context is misrepre. entative (as 
for most it is), or not represented at all. then it 
inevitably follow that reliable and legitimate 
assenionofone's race or gender as positive is 
an impossibility. 

No wonder most of the successful indi-
vidual in this country are white males. And 
forthose of you who are mourning the "disap-
pearance" (yeah, right) of the American so-
cial heirarchy, take heart - there are still 
those who have unconscious, preconceived 
notions about ethnicity and gender, and who 

have a marked impact on social progress. 
Doesn'( (he fact that unconscious media 

are used to promote discrimination instead of 
peace bother us? Or have we uncon ciou Iy 
decided to not care,too? 

Despite what appear to be oven gains, 
there are subtle but dangerous force at work. 

Whatever Clarence Thomas mayor may 
not have done to Anita Hill, he did it all 
himself, without any help from the "powers 
that be." 

But think about it. By just nominating the 
man, President Bush did an excellent job of 
dividing the black community with contro-
versy overtokeni m, and raising internal stri fe 
within the nation's women's movements. 
Divided we fall. 

And in the very Senate which he.1rd the 
Thomas case, there. has been only one black 
senator since reconstruction, and currently 
include: 98 white males and two .white fe-
males. Surely thi s is not the resu It of progress 
- oven or coven. 

Issues like the 1l1Omas nomination, affir-
mative action, and political COITectness keep 
u all busy wondering about outcomes of 
potentially petty situations, instead of being 

. aware of what's going on as we disagree 
amongst ourselves. 

Use your peripherJI vision - there are 
other things going on that demand our atten-
tion. Such narrow focus by people only in-
vites more foul play by the govemment on the 
sidelines. And we can be guaranteed that by 
maintaining such blind ~l~sumptions about 
ethnicity and gender, we 've <llmost lost the 
game.

HARASSMENT: Hill deserves sympathy and praise 
ContInued from ..... 4 
nesses. ' 0 it was her word against 
hL (and he Wa!i in a more powert'ul 
po ition), protecting her job, pro-
tect ing hercareeropponunities, pro-
tecting lhe very delicale balance 
needed for women in the work force 
to maintain camaraderie with male 
co-workers and connections within 
her field. 

It's networking, folks. And it is 
vital for Women who wish to break 
Ihrough the old-boy's school glass 
ceiling thaI still constrains women. 
Hill broke through, bul at whatCOSI? 

If I think that 1l1omas may have 
harassed HiII,then is he lying? Like 
many p ychologists are saying, il is 
too difficuillo tell. He may not have 
harassed her. She may have exag-
gerated some of tile things he says 
he did. He may have, in his mind, 
downplayed hi own action out of 
embarras ment. to a point where he 
no longer remembers what he did. 
Or maybe he did not at the time 
consider what he did to be harass-
ment, but ralher "friendly joking 
around." 

Second, I mu t admit that the 
proceedings went 100 far. Senate 
hearing ' were not intended as trial , 
but that is what happened in theend. 
Thomas went on trial for haras -
menl, and Hill for perjury. Neither 
was truly able to defend him or 
herself from witnes es and sworn 
(ortelephone) testimonies. Even one 
of the witnesses was tried for ha-
rassment! The ituation was better 

fit for a counroom. where maybe 
the tit- for-tat Ieslimonies may have 
been foregone. 

We have been left withan unfair 
slalemate. Can any good come out 
of this? Should Thomas have been 
confinned to serve on the court? 

As for Thomas on me Supreme 
Coon, the answer is tricky. If he did 
harass Hill, then he shouldn't set 
foot in a counroom ever again. And 
neither should any other judge guilty 
of the same indiscretion. But then, 
wemayendupwith too rnanyemplY 
coun rooms. 

Even if11loma<i dido '( hara'iS Hill , 
he is in a very delic3te situalion be-
cause the media will be down his 
throat fortherestofhi life, wailing for 
him 10 make a miSlakeso thar trey can 
bring this case 10 the forefront again. If 
I wereTIlomas,and I hope to never be, 
I would quit while I was ahead. But 
!hen even that could be seen as an 
admi ion of guill.llle Democmls got 
him this time. 

Another side bar: I'm a voting 
Democr.lt and a feminist, and I un -
derstand that Hill brought heraccu-
at ions to light earlier thi summer, 

so I have to say that it was very 
weasely of the Democratic party 
members to hold onto the accusa-
tion until the la t minute. 

Thegoodthatha. comeoutofall 
oflhese proceedings is The allenrion 
the media has given to sexu<ll ha-
rassment . Those words are on 
everyone' s lips the e days. Women 
who have been silent for years are 

talking aboul their experiences. 
Unfonullately. lhey are callin~ il 
"confessing to having been ~ex u ­
ally haras.-;ed." 

The proceedings have caused 
people to be more open aboul sexual 
h.ull~t. II is important in helping 
men and women 10 under-mUld ex h 
other. and to undersland what is 'IC-
ceptable behavior and whal is not. 

There is more to avoiding ha-
rassment than following a li~t ofdos 
and don'ts. In fact,someexpenson 
harassment are now saying thaI in-
fonnation circulated to men on 
how to avoid hara.~ing women is 
causing more problem than it 
solves. Men are now afraid to speak 
ca. ually to women at all, and there-
fore women are having trouble net-
working. 

Men have a ~ ponsibility to rec-
ognize how their actions affect the 
women around them. And women 
have lhe responsibility to let men 
know whal they feel is unacceptable 
behavior without alienating men 
completely. 

My martial arts instructor said 
that because of lhese hearing, 
Jacoby & Meyers and lbe Law 
Office of Sam Spital will drop 
worker' s compensalion cases and 
. tan advertising to help women in 
haras. ment case.~. He said women 
have hit the jackpot. 

BUI. I said_ if men would take 
notice of how they are affecting the 
women around them, there would 
be no jackpor.

QUOTAS 
ContInued from PIlle 3 
may go all the way to the Su-
premeCoun. [There] I believe they 
will uphold the Bakke decision, and 
define it in clearer terms," 
Rohrabacher said yesterday. Bakke 
v. the Regellfs of the University of 
Calijol'llia is a 1978 U.S. Supreme 
Coun case in which the use of quo-
tas in university admi ions was 
held to be unconsititutional. 

According to Rohrabacher, the 
siluation at UCSD is not unlike that 
ot otller universities . 

"We have had a lot of contact 
with other campuses [like UC Ber-
keley] on this subject . We're just 
asking the Department of Educa-
lion to look into this situation. What 
is happening at UCSD is IIOt un-
usual. It is people using affinnative 
action as an excuse fordiscriminat-
ing against people," he aid. 

"[Rohrabacherj is wrong, and it 
is evident that he doesn't under-
stand our admissions procedure ," 
Bowker said. 

Vice ChancellorofU ndergradu-
ate Affairs Joseph Watson, in an 
interview with Ihe Los Angeles 
Times, agreed with Bowker in in-
sisting that Rohrabacher is incor-
rect in his accusations. 

"The accusation indicate that 
his only infonnation on this came 
from newspaperaJticles which came 
OUI on April 29 and April 30 in the 
San Diego Union. Either he's a 
slow reader or he's not on top of 
things because it has been six ' 
months," Bowker charged. 

Bowker said that neither 
Rohrabachernoranymemberofhis 
staff has attempted to contact any 
slaff member at UCSD. "Had he 
just made a simple phone call , it 
would have been [taken care ofJ," 
he said. 

But according to both Y AF and 
. Rohrabacher, communication with 
the university on admission poli-
cies was unneccessary. 

"There were a lot of anicles in 
the paper [and] I think Rohrabal:her's 
office was faxed infonnation by 

Y AF. We gave him all the infonna-
tion on what the university does," 
said a fonner Y AF member who 
wished to remain anonymous. 

Y AF ChairGary Geiler said that 
the organization contacted 
Rohrabacher's assistant Gary Kum 
and gave him a detailed description 
of what has occurred on campus 
during last summer and over the 
quarter. The organization ha [II 0 
faxed infonnation to columnist Pat 
Buchanan, the Wall Street Journal, 
the National Review, and lhe na-
tional office of the Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom. ''They have all 
supponed [the UCSD Y AF], "Geiler 
said. 

"The San Diego Union. the Los 
Angeles Times, and KNSD' Roger 
Hedgecock have all covered [the 
seven SweeTwater High School stu-
dents]. Bureaucrats on campus 
thought this would all go away . .. 
our focus is to expose discrimina-
tion," Geiler said. 

According to Geiler, Y AF also 
has taped conversations with both 
Anthony Jemison, UCSD director 
Qf Studenl Affinnative Action and 
Human Relations, and Bowker. 
They plan to give the tapes to the 
Education Depanmenr invesliga-
rors. 

Originally, Geiler said he would 
give transcripts of the taped conver-
sations 10 BowkerandJemison. But 
since both Bowker and Jemison had 
consented on tape to being taped, 
attomeys have adv ised Gei ler not to 
release the tapes or transcripts of 
them, according to the anonymous 
fonner Y AF member. 

Jemison said recently that he does 
not think that any of the material on 
the tape could be helpful to YAF's 
position. 

"I had one conversation with 
YAF in regards 10 flyers having 
been taken down. [AsJ their flyers 
did talk about goals ve .... us quolas 
here on campus, we may have 
touched on it. I may have spoken to 
them on admissions policies in gen-
eral, but I referred them to Admis-
sions Officer Ron Bowker for [spe-
cific delails]," he said.

Jemison added that any investi-
gation into admissions policies 
would not directly affect the Stu-
dent Affinn[ltive Action progmm. 
He added. " Everything we do here 
is above the board." 

Bowkersaid that hel:annot imag-
ineanything being on Lhe tapeofhis 
conversation with UCSD Y AF 
members that could aid the investi -
gation. 

He added that he does not have 
quotas to fill , nor does he receive 
pressure from anyone, including the 
Chancellor' s office, to admit spe-
cific . tudents or groups of s tudents. 

"We don't havequot3s. lthought 
I had explained it 110 YAFj ad-
equalely, bUI I don't know what 
happened," he said. 

Bowker added, " If they want to 
investigate, we've got nothing to 
hide." 

The fonner Y AF mcn,ber said 
that Bowker's attitude could be an 
indication that he and lhe adminis-
tration are more worried than they 
appear to be. . 

Geiler said that Y AF at UCSD 
was "in the forefront" in promoting 
the investigation, but that lhe Fili-
pinocommunity was obviously be-
hind the investigation, as well. 

The anonymous fonner Y AF 
member alleged that, while there 
are no set policies based on quol3s 
[i.e. 10 percent of admissions must 
be African-American], the UCSD 
administration actually has goals it 
is trying to fulfill . 

"And how do you fulfill goals? 
You manipulate the fonnula," he 
said. 

He went on to say that the admis-
sion policy for those who do not fall 
within the 60 percent of students 
who are 3dmitted on grade point 
avemge and test scores alone is the 
problem with UCSD's system. 

According to the universily. the 
freshmen admitted to UCSD who 
are among the 60 percent are chosen 
based first upon grade point average 
and test scores, with the addition of 
whal the university tenns "objec-
tive and subjective factors."

However, she said, the tudent 
regent's vOle is not as important as 
the ability to bring the perspective 
of $tudents and members of lower 
economic classes into discussions 
over university policy, since the 
bo.lrd of regents is largely made up 
of wealthy members of the business 
community who may nOl have a 

g~ p of the financially-strapped 
student 's si tuation. 

Darnell emphasized that the stu-
dent re/,~nt can also bring the per-
pectives of women and minorities 

to the board, since these groups are 
also underrepresented. 

Mark Rotenberg, Warren Senior 
Senatorto the A.S. council. said that 
he allended the infom13t ion ses ion 
because he i "intere ted in how the 
regents work SO the council can 
work more effectively with them." 

When asked why he wi hed to 
apply to the position. Warren Sopho-
more Senator Poncho Guevara 
said,"I would like to see more inter-
action between the board and stu-
dents." 

The primary qualification for 
being a student regent is to be regis-
tered as a UC student in good stand-
ing. 

'The application proces is rigor-
ous, involving three rounds of inter-
views before a student i selected, 
Darnell said, though, that the pro-

experience.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Coming Out Day Acknowledges Human Rights 
Editor: 

I am writing this letter in re-
sponse to the "Coming Out of the 
Ooset," article that appeared in the 
Monday, October 14,1991 issueof 
the Guardian. It was good of the 
Guardia" to cover this important 
event in the front page. Myobjec-
tion is to the fact that the coverage 
was simpli tic and limited_ 

National Coming Out Day is not 
only a day of tudenls publicly an-
nouncing their homosexuality or 
bi exuality: it is aday of coming out 
and showing support for homosex uaI 
and bisexual rights. It is a day cen-
tered around human respect. Noone 
should be forced or conditioned to 
feel ashamed for who they are. No 
one should feel "closeted" or lim-
ited in expressing who they are and 
what they think. 

National Coming Out Day is 
opening closets and breaking out of 
limitations. The closets and limita-
tions are not solely confined to the 
homosexual or bisexual commu-
nity. 

The anicle is structured on the 
basic premise that if one speaks in 
support of gay,lesbians or bisexual 
rights, then one must be gay ,lesbian 
or bisexual. This conclusion is false. 
One does not have to be gay, lesbian 
or bisexual to speak. 

For me, speaking was not based 
on an issue of sexuality but, one of 
human respect. One's sexuality is 
not and should not be the sole defin-
ing characteristic of a person. 

Everyone's sexuality is one facet 
of a whole being. Emphasizing one 
characteristic of a person is an ex-
tremely limiting approach to under-
standing what it means to be a hu- -
man being. 

National Coming Out Day is for 
everyone to express their sensitivity 
and support for gay, lesbian and 
bisexual rights.

Concern Over ~ 
DIscrimination· • Discl sed ..IS! 

Editor's note: The/allowing is a 
letter 10 Graduate Student Associa-
tion President Denise Fentonfrom 
graduate students concerned about 
housing discrimination against ho-
mosexuals. 
Editor: 

Weare very concerned about the 
domestic partnership issue, and are 

pleased lhat you are planning on 
bringing it up with President 
Gardner, and urge you to pre.sent 
our case forcefully. Many graduate 
students in our department art: out-
mged at policies that so blatantly 
discriminate against people on the 
grounds of marital tatu and sexual 
orientation. We have a large and 
politically active group of lesbian 
and gay graduate students in the 
literature departmerlt, many of 
whom are members of GALL (Gay 
and Lesbians in Literature), a regis-
tered graduate student organization, 
and GALL is also planning protests 
against these discriminatory poli-
cies. 

As we see it, to amend its hous-
ing policies would simply ;'ring 
UCSD, and/or other UCs if they 
were to jointly carry out this action, 
into compliance with their wrillen 
policies about non-discrimination 
on the basis of sexual orientation. 
However, we would like to see this 
amendment addressing the needs 
. not only of gay and lesbian students, 
but of unmarried, heterosexual 
couples and other non-traditional 
couples as well. It goes without say-
ing that unmarried heterosexual, les-
bian, gay and other non-traditional 
couples can be just as committed to 
each other as married, heterosexual 
couples. 

To discriminate against people 
in these relationships is to force 
economic, emotional and transpor-
tation burdens on them. Quite sim-
ply then, we would like to see the 
regulations, and language about 
regulations, regarding student hous-
ing at UCSD (and other UCS if 
possible) changed to recognize the 
needs and rights of lesbian, gay, 
non-married heterosexual, and other 
non-traditional couples. 

Questions that could be studied 
toward this goal: 

I ) On what campuses, UCs and 
others, is this issue presently being 
fought? What is happening? Have 
any campuses !lmended regulations 
yet? 

2) What would it take to bring !l 
change about? Do we, here and at 
other UC ,need to help get another 
bill before the state assembly/legi -
lature, for example? In other words, 
are there larger political is ues to be 
addressed before we can settle our 
immediate issue? 

3) What tcps can we take to get 
thisproce smovingforward?Would 
student prote ts - and at what level 
- bring attention to this mailer? 

4) What suggestions and idea 
do UC admini trJtor have for us? 
Are they willing to be helpful in this 
mailer? 

5) What legal rights do we have 
here? How do we pres for those 
rights? 

Members of GALL and many 
other Literature Department gradu-
ate students are invested in seeing a 
po itive outcome to this issue and 
would be happy to work withyouon 
it. We also urge you to contact 
LGBA, the Stone Wall Club, and 
the faculty/staff lesbian/gay asso-
ciation so that their energy, efforts 
and numbers can be added to lhis 
negotiation.

HaJperwill be instructing UCSD 
to keep its slingshots loaded. He has 
said that he expects nothing less 
than an all~t tooth and nail banle 
from UCI. 

Man for man,lrvi,ie is a very big 
and powerful team. Harper knows 
that the Tritons will be kept busy 
with the likes of Anteater hole man 
SteveGiU. "He is very, very aggres-
sive," said Harper, who will counter 
with UCSD All-American Jason 
"Turtle" Brown. "lbose two are 
going to be on each other all day. 

"Turtlehasdoneagoodjobinthe 
past of handling Gill," Harper said. 
"But Gill is definitely going to get 
his three or four goals." 

The Anteaters' power doesn't 
stop with Gill. 

Pablo Yriezar, a player on the 
Mexican national team, help pro-
vide the speed for UC Irvine's al-
ready potent offense. What he la ks 
in size, Y riezar makes up for in ball 
handling. The Tritons will attempt 
to counter with sprinter Kevin 
Vance. 

ing minutes. Harper believes Chat 
theAntealers will try and establish a 
paacm of a very physical game - a 
panern which will make referees 
look for rough play on the part of 
UCSD as well. 

Harper and the Tritons hopie thal 
the referees will keep the game un-
der control and not let the play get 
too physical as was the case in last 
wcelc's game againsr USC. 

UCSD plans to ~nter aggres-
siveness with aggressiveness. In 
addition, the Tritons will attempt to 
create offensive motion by worting 
on driving through the hole during 
dead time. 

"If we just sit, (Irvine] is going to 
grab us and hang on to us and basi-
cally use us as human starting blocks 
for theircounteranack," Harpersaid. 
This could create problems with the 
speedy Yriezar in the pool. 

With so much motion, the Tri-
tons hope to draw some ejections. 
Man-upopportunities have not been 
a strong spot for UCSD this year. 
however, as over-passing at times 
has led to poor shot selection and 
turnovers.

And slow it down they did. After 
the frantic first half, the Tritons 
caImcd down and exploded in ma-
chine guo fashion for five goals. 

Eddy added another goal, this 
time off a corner kick from Shea. 

Soon thereafter, Lindsay headed 
one in off a cross by Parter. One 
minute after thot goal, Shea drilled 
in a shoe from 20 yards out off 
another assist by Parker. 

Kary DuIock got in on the action 
with a shot to the upper right corner 
from yet another Parker pass. Parker 
finished out the scoring, taking a 
Jodie Robertson pass and blistering 
the net from JO yards out. 

Parker had four assists and one 
goal when all was said and done. 
"After Brian's halftime speech, we 
got our intensity up and kepi it go-
ing." she said. explaining the sec-
ond half outburst. 

"Anyone who is on him will rc-
ally have to be consciou. of him," 
Harper said. "We're going to have 
to try and keep the ball out of his 
h:mds." A third offensive threat 
come inthefonnofSkylerPutnam. 

The phy ical play and amount of 
motion UCSD hopes to create could 
lead to fatigue. Harper has said that 
hehasconfidenceinhi. bench,how-
ever. and hopes that it could be yet 
another advantage for the Tritons. 
The Anteaters have traditionally not 
had a trong bench. 

McManus wa~depending on that 
intensity to carry the team through 
the Cal Poly game. The players 
didn ' t need any halftime speeches 
to get them focused for thi game 
though: UCSD had been looking . 
forward to this game for a while. 

" It was a good all-around team 
effort," McManu said. 

JeMiler KoIsI<y/GcwcUl 
Cheryl Parker had four assists and one goal against Cal Baptist Monday. 

But Harper expects nothing Ie s 
than the typical hard·nosed UC Ir-
vine water polo that he has become 
acquainted with in recem years. 
"They're going to come out and 
hold u and pound on us." Harper 
said. He look forUClrvinetocome 
out extremely aggressive in the open-

This weekend could be an im-
portant one in the program' s history 
as well, as Jason Brown attempt to 
tie, or break, the current UCSD all-
time record for goal scored. Tom 
Moore holds the record with 21 I 
goals. Brown trails by only two. 

The Tritons received goals from 
Eddy. Jaymie Bradford and Lind-
say to notch the victory. McManus 
was particularly plea<;ed with the 
play of Lindsay: "Karen Lindsay 
was out tanding, all over the field 
today." 

The game wa a real bailie ac-
cording to McManu : "It was a real 
physical game: Cal Poly was tough." 

The defense was anchored by 
Shea and Amy Wayte, who "kept 
the team together in back." It was 
the eighth shutout of the season for 
goalie Jenelle Welling, who has al-
lowed only three goals all year. 

McManus was pleased with hi 
team's effort and the potential that 
UCSD showed going into Satur-
day's showdown with Cal Sate San

"Chaminade did a goodjob dig·

"[ was very impressed with the commitment each of the Hyperlearning instructors displayed. Each of them 
worked very luzrd which motivated us to do the same." 
"Hyperlearning was a motivational tool that everyone must have. The course /ceeps you motivated, but you 
still havefun with the learning experience." 
"[ can't praise the entire staff enough. [feel we were given all the tools to ace the MeAT. Just as 
important was the encouragement and the confidence we all received. This was one of the best academic

'This class was more helpful and thorough than [ ever thought a review course could be. Hyperlearning 
hiJs taught me bener tluzn some of my undergraduiUe courses and I would definitely recommend it to

Things are beginning to return to fonn for

with a lillie more con i ·tency for the Triton. 
Last night, in Pomona. UCSD downed Cal 
Poly Pomona 5-0 to raise its record to 9-4. 

But after that, the Tritons hnd 
nothing but missed oPpoltunities. 
UCSD hnd shot. bouncing off the 
po ts, sailing over the net and hit-
tingotherplayers.A the half ended, 
the Lancers were lucky to be down 
only 1-0; it could ju t have easily 
been 5-0. 

"We were too anxious to score in 
the first hal f," said Head Coach Brian 
McManus. " We hnd to top just 
kicking and I1Inning.ljust told them 
to slow it down in the second half." 

And slow it down they did. After

Perhap more il11pol1antly, UCSD- withthe

YOilrOwn Private Idaho 
By Joseph Gan:la 
Hiatus Editor 

Set in the Pacific Northwest, "My 
Own Private Idaho" is the tale of 
narcoleptic husrler Mike Waters (River 
Phoenix), and his search forthemorher 
who exists in his mind through 8mm 
movie reels. Mike Waters has the 
worstcinematicexi tenceofanychar-
acter-anywhere. Timeaftertimethe 
hardship and let-down he goes 
through are unbelievable.1l1e viewer 
wants to see his life tum for the bener, 
but. like reaJity, these wanlS never 
have an impact on hi life. 

P-.unJlelto Waters' crummy life i. 
thechosen crummy lifeofScon Favor 
(Keanu Reeves). Scott could have' it 
all-well, at least money and what it 
could buy. His father is the mayor of 
Portland, and Favor left home to rebel 
against a lifestyle he felt he needed to 
leave to appreciate. . 

He is Waters' best, and sometimes 
only friend. You would like to think 
that they will be together forever. Fa-
vor, peaking in unrhymed iambic 
pentameter borrow~ straight from 
"HemylV,Part I ," lels uS knowear\y 
in the movie that once his father dies 
hewillretumhome, leavinghis friends 
and life on the street. 

The majority of the char-deters are 
centered i';,'an abandoned building in 
Portland. It is in Portland that they 
encr-unter B~ Pigeon (William 
Riche,l), whoalso h<1JesSconFavor's 
knack for borrowing from 
Shakespeare. Pigeon apd Favor are in 
conflict for the entire movie. and 
Favor' b rerum to high-soCiety leads to 
Pigeon's demise. 

Alsocentrnlto Favor and Pigeon' 
relatiolt~hip is Budd (Flea), who is to 
Pigeon what Wmers is to Favor. Nei-
ther Mike Waters nor Budd are lead-
\!rs: both follow their mentors every-
where (in Waters' case. even 10 an-
othercounliy). B udd and WmerSnever 
l>eelll to notice lhat their mentors are 

~pe;.u<ing lines from Shakespeare. It i 

their love for their idols Ihm causes 
them to follow their menrors any-
where. 

Mike Waters is in love with Favor. 
No, not the kind of love typical of a 
buddy movie. the kind of love two 
people more often share in a romance 
movie. Both men are hustle.rs and 
have sex with members of the same 
sex (never with each other). but Favor 
lets it be known that he only does it for 
the money. Waters. whosefatherishi 
brother, never tates an opinion on his 
sexuality, but the viewer does know 
he has a real love for Favor. 

The cinematogmphy is beautiful 
and inventive. 1bere are scenes in-
cluded merely to suggest ideas for the 
viewer to think about, but not centra1 
to what is happening on the screen. 
From theinsideofanabandoned build-
ing to miles and miles of desolate 
ldaholandscape,everythingisasbeau-
tiful as possible. 

Rarely are love scenes shot with 
such beauty, care, and originality-
the homo5exual scenes are as beauti-
ful as the heterosexual scenes(unlike 
some films which deal with similar 
lopiCS). The dialogue flows as well as 
theS[ory, both passing as wonderfully 
as the scenes themselves. 

Phoenix proves his dramatic act-
ingskills; Reeves almost follow uit 
Richert is convincing as Pigeon. I 
couldn't imagi£\C meeting him in real 
life and him not being the same as the 
character. All the actors inte.a:[ within 
the movieas if it were real life, making 
it possible to become fully absorbed in 
it. 

"My Own Private Idaho" can be 
viewed as two tories, one of Waters 
and one of Favor. In fact. the director 
wan the viewer to lICe the movie this 
way. The story i. , however, domi" 
nated by Waters ·miserablecxl:.tence, 
Favor is only one more cluml1lY ele-
ment in Waters ' awful life. "My Own 
Private Idaho" is a Iingic ~tory of 
unequaled caliber in the inetie. ...

• The A.S. commis ioner of programming takes time from ill bu y schedule to let u know ju t what he doe 
By .Joseph Garcia

Matt Schnurer is the master of

Forget all that. Schnurer, as pro-
grammer, has an important job on 
campus. He brings us the movies. 
the TG's, the lecturers . He brings us 
pub howcase featuring local bands 
and he brings national touring bands 
to campus. His role as programmer 
isn't just 'here you are,' giving usa

friend, his knowledge of retail 
buying obtained from a previ-
ous job in an audio lore, and an 
intention to make affordable 
CD available to the eclectic 
public. 

" It ' like a pawn hop ," 
Rasmussen said. "People can 
buy and trade their CDs, but the 
prices are guaranteed." 

"There is a wide enough musical

The overhead costs are low 
enough to keep merchandise priced 
equally low - a factor that is cru-

his six-lTlOnth-old business. 

Along with trading and buying 
CDs from the public, Rasmussen 
obtains a good deal of his inventory 
from wholesale di stributors. He 

credi t Abbey Road Distributors for 
supplying him with much of his 
new merchandise. While most of 
the CDs at Lola's are used (and 
therefore less expensive), there is a 
ufficient supply of new CDs for 

customers 10 ample. 
"One advantage [of this Iype of 

store] is that we get fresh stock 
daily," aid Rasmussen of both his 
used and unused collection. " I will

Rasmussen, all merchandise is

ALBUM REVIEWS 

The Cult 
CeremoflY 

ire 

Two words sums up 111c ult's 
fourth relea e - shit sandwich. If 
you already own SUllie Temple then 
there i ' no need to buy this album. 
Lacking any feeling or riginality, 
Ccremollyis verproducedand n t 
very interesting. I would love to say 
omething nice about this album but 

there isn ' t anything to say - even 
the album art is boring. 

The Cult may have once been an 
al!emative band, but it has since 
succumbed to mega-U.S. success 
and is now more interested in seil-
ing a productthru i safe and mar-
ketable. Billy Duffy and Ian A~tbury 
are now into the l-care-abouHhe-
planet-let -do- omething-about-it-
before-it's-too-Iategarbage, in what 
seems to be a marketing ploy to 
wow those Greenpeacers whodon't 
already listen to The Cull. Certainly 
the music i n't going to win over 
any new fans. In fact, the band may 
even lose a few. 

In keeping wi th Astbury's vocal 
style there are "baby, baby, baby, 
baby, baby, etc. ," and more waysof 
referring to a woman without actu-
ally u ing her name. The ong " In-
dian" doesn't seem to really be about 
an Indian maiden - Astbury use~ 
the word Indian like he forg t some 
gal' name. 

Billy Duffy' guitar work eems 
to have improved since the band' 
last outing - thi meaning he can 

The UCSD Guardian 

play the typical pop-metal lines with 
an ounce more finesse than on Sonic 
Temple. TIle solos are trite and the 
chord progressions redundant. 

Who cares about the rhythm sec-
tion? 1lley're not in any photos and 
one only know they exist by intu-
ition (unless you happened to notice 
the tiny printatlhebollomofeachof 
the 50ng lyrics). 

Maybe the band should change 
its name from The Cult to Billy and 
Ian Made it Big in the U.S., which 
might even bea suitable title forthi 
imple, dull, and plain effort.

Cypress Hill 
Cypress Hill 

Rough House/Columbia 

Now that N.W.A. has decided to 
leave its treel roots and take up 
pointless. violent storytelling, it is 
time to find a new voice from the 
street. That new voice i Cypress 
Hill, and its debut effort is a kick-
ass, hip-hop romp through the dark 
side of L.A. treet . 

Rappers Sen Dog and B-Real 
know the street and its unplea. .... nt-
nes , and have no qualms about 
haring it with you. Their tales of 

urban violence and drugs don 't come 
off as boasting, but more as down-
to-earth nnd believable. It i n't a 
glorification of urban violence, it' 
relating the world of urban violence 
via rhyme and rhythm. 

The first single. "Pigs," is a dark 
adaptation of a nursery rhyme ("t h is 
hnle piggy went to the market .. . "). 
However, in Cypre s Hill's version, 
the pigs are donut-eating cops who 
cannot even get along with them-
selves, let alone get along with those 
they are supposed to protect. 

Track after track, Cypress Hill 
describe how they prolect lhe 'hood 
and, oftcntirne , relate it to how 
those not in theirsituation (i.e., those 
in (he 'safe' neighborhoods) would 
dothe same thing. When they're not

cal are whiny and the mid-mnge in 
the samples is nonexistent. 

This leaves the album with too

keeps this from being a prominent

Galactic Cowboys 
Galsclie Cowboys 

DGC 

From the moos of the first track 
to the last note of the album, Galac-
tic Cowboys just cannotdecide what 
they want. They want the power and 
grunge of metal, they want pop vo-
cal hannonies, they want to be seri-
ous,they want to be funny. I 'm sure 
there is a band that could mix these 
sometimes-conflictingquai ities, but 
the Cowboys aren't that band. It 
isn't a bad thing to not be able to 
handle these juxtapositioned musi-
cal ideas - they cenainly try, and . 
maybe they will conquer them on 
their next release. 

Galactic Cowboys is certainly a 
fresh release in the t ired metal genre. 
You'd think the metal rjffing they 
do has been played somewhere else 
before, but this is offset by their 
more pop-oriented element , which 
are the strongest and the most origi-
nal elements of the album. 

In the vein of King's X, the Ga-
lactic Cowboys attack metal via the 
Beach Boys. They sing well and the 

hannonies are nice. It just doesn't 
always blend well within the con-
text of the songs. TIle Cowboys 
don't always blend metal with vocal 
harmony. Instead of blending, they 
play mdaI and tht!1I switch to pop 
rock and then add, as a bonus, vocal 
harmony. It is thisjuxlaposition that 
creates the problem. Hey, maybe 
the rest of America likes it - 1 
don't. 

The album is produced well and 
everything sounds good. It is the 
thick metal parts that don't combine 
with the glossy pop elements that 
detract from this album. A¥. far as 
packaging goes, I just don't get it. 
The booklet is filled with notes from 
around the United SWe5--to whom, 
I don't know. Why are they there? 
Who knows that either? They look 
good with the sci-fi art though. If 
extremely eclectic is what the Ga-
lactic Cowboys aspire to be,tl1ey've 
succeeded at it. 

Public Enemy 
Apocolypse 91 ... 

The Enemy Strikt!s Black 
Def Jam/Columbia 

Public Enemy is black with 14 
more tracks of PE philosophy. This 

The UCSD Guardian 

time around, even Flavor F1av's 
taken a somewhat serious tum at the 
r.tp game. Every effort PE has put 
forth has been solid as a rock: Chuck 
D rhyming circle around hi peers, 
Terminator X CUlling and scratch-
ing new territory in the rap genre, 
and the F1av i always humorous. 

Apo<:alypse 9/ ... is as olid as 
past opuses, yet lacks that 'next 
step' evolution of its last two al-
bum . Many of the track ound as 
though they justdidn't make it onto 
Fear of a Black Planet. No one said 
PE had to forge new ground with 
every album, but I had grown to 
expect it from them. 

On another note, it is hard to 
listen to a PE album and decide how 
to judge it to make the review inter-
esting.1berearemanywaystoview 
the album and discuss those views 
in great length. 

Do I center on the content of 
Chuck D's rhymes, or how they are 
delivered? Is it what the samples 
say, or how they sound within the 
context of the music? Is there more 
to how Apocalypse 9/ ... sounds as 
an album, or is it like a book, each 
song being a chapter, each album 
being a new volume in Ihe series? 
Are the vignette adjuncts to ongs, 
or part of a cohesive whole? I don't 
even know where to begin, let alone 
figure out how to fit the discuss ion 
into Ie than a zillion pages -. 0 I 
won't try. 

The only way a conclusion can 
be made is to pick up the album 
yourself. If you like Public Enemy, 
you'll like the album. You might 
even love it-it's that simple. Chuck 
D drop more knowledge Ihan Cen-
tral Library could in 10 decades. 
Here is a rap act that cares more 

about its audience than any other act 
in any genre that I know. If you 
don't get it. then maybe it's a black 
thing, but I don't think so. PE cares 
about people. black or white, and 
jusr wants to sec some change in 
humanity for the beller. Apocalypse 
91 ... furthers this philosophy.

Pearl Jam 
Ten 
Epic 

This is truly the year of Seallie 
sound. AUhebeginning,lhree bands 
dominated the scene: Nirvana, 
Sound garden, and Mother Love 
Bone. Bone's lead singer, Andrew 
Wood, died tragically last year, and 
ba sist Jeff and guitari t Stone col-
laborated on thi year's Temple of 
the Dog album with Soundgarden. 

Mother Love Bone never 
grabbed the spotlight like Ihe other 
Seattle bands. but with Pearl Jam, 
Jeff and Stone have the chance to 
prove that they deserve the atten-
tion. 

Jeff and Stone met up with vo-
calist Eddie, guitarist Mike and 
drummer Dave. 111e result is one of 
the most jamming albums of the 
year. Pearl Jam 's debut album, 

HIATUS H7 

"Ten," fuses the roots of rock with 
the trademark Northwestern sound. 

The product is a collection of 
ong. that rock hard. Every song on 

the album is greal, but "Porch." 
"Once" and "Alive" area cut above 
the rest. But the best track by far is 
"Release," a ballad that progre~ses 
into an ear feast of psychedclia. 

Nothing is convemional about 
Pearl Jam 's ound. Unlike other 
groups, il uses ballads as a fom1 of 
progres ion from serenity to angst 
and back. Each tu'ne that hits hard 
isn't abrasive to the point of tension. 
Rather, each song hooks in the lis-
tener and moves the audience to a 
new height, whether it is pain, hap-
piness. or the loss of love. 

"1etalentofeachmusician bursts 
through with a vigor that has been 
missing in many of the new Fall 
releases.111e interplay of guitar work 
between Mike and Stone is pure 
magic. Eddie's ethereal voice comes 
in and out like the sun through the 
clouds. Dave and Jeff s rhyt hm pro-
vides an incredibly solid backbone 
for the band. 

But don't put Pearl Jam in the 
same league as Alice in Chains. 
PearlJam has u ed its root. tocreate 
its mystical sound. In a YC<lr where 
nuffy metal has taken over, it is 
excit i ng that this band will grow and 
give us more great rock .
