Roosevelt sophomore 
found dead in apartment 
Police suspect suicide, pending 

al ort fi- oroner's office 
By VLADlMII KOGAN 

News Editor 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Christina Cho died 
after ingesting self-administered 
over-the-counter sleeping medica-
tion on the evening of Nov. 15, 
police believe. 

Cho's roommate contacted the 
UCSD Police Department after 
discovering Cho's body in their 
Oceania Hall aparnnent, according 
to Sergeant Bob Jones. 

"She was pronounced deceased 
at the scene and, because it is an 
unattended death, this requires a 
coroner's investigation as well," 
Jones said. "Pending the findings of 
the coroner's office, it is an appar-
ent suicide." 

Roosevelt administrators have 
arranged for special counseIon to 
help close friends with the grieving 

process, according to Provost Ann 
L. Craig. Psychological and 
COWlSeling Services will also con-
tinue to provide regular and emer-
.gency help for students allover the 
campus. 

"In their colleges, there are peo-
ple ready to help them deal with 
this," Craig said. 

In a letter to the college's stu-
dents, Roosevelt Dean of Student 
Affairs Patricia L. Scott forwarded 

. the Cho family's request for privacy 
and sensitivity. 

-To all of you who knew 
Christina, we extend our sincere 
condolences and recognize that 
this is a loss particularly for you but 
also for the entire ERC and UCSD 
community," Scott stated. "A death 
of someone so young is always a 
tragedy and saddens us all. "

Lawmaker urge's possible 
overhaul in outreach 

State, university must now 'do 
more with less,' Speier says 

By CHAlLIS NGUYEN 
Staff \'kiter 

As a part of an ongoing UC-
wide "listening tour," State Sen. 
Jackie Speier (D-San 
Francisco/San Mateo), visited 
UCSD on Nov. 16 to hear student 
leaden voice their concerns about 
the effect of budget cuts on educa-
tion, especially in the areas of 
diversity and outreach, and to out-
line her goal of prioritizing higher 
education in California. 

Speier's interest in university 
budgets began last year, during 
renegotiations of a $200 million 
contract for state prison guards 
during a fiscal crisis, she said. At 
the same time, she received budget 
proposals that suggested divating

Minority numbers up 'at 
medical ' school, nationwide 

. By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

The number of new black and 
Hispanic students enrolled at 
UCSD School of Medicine rose 
in 2004 for the second year in a 
row, according to the school's 
Associate Dean of Diversity 
Sandra Daley and Associate Dean 
of Admissions Carolyn Kelly. 

The trend has matched simi-
lar numbers in data released by 
the Associa.rion of American 
Medical Colleges, which show an 
increase in total applicants and 
indicate that more ethnic 
minorities are applying to and 
attending medical schools 
nationwide. 

"If the application rate is going 
up, our enrollment is going up 
simultaneously," Daley said. "If 
the pool is enlarging, we are fish-
ing in the same big pool." 

At the medical school, the 
number of total applicants rose 6 
percent, while the number of 
black and Hispanic applicants 
Jumped 12 percent and 9 percent, 

. respectively, according to Kelly. 
In medical schools across the 

country, the number of Hispanic 
applicants rose 2.5 percent, while 
the number of black applicants 
rose 2.3 percent, according to the 
AAMC national data. In addition, 
the annual survey showed an 8-
percent increase in Hispanic 
enrollment in medical schools, 
while ' black emollmcot rose . 2.5 
percent. 

The organization noted that in 
2003, national Hispanic and black 
enrollment dropped by 6 and 4 
percent, respectively. 

AAMC attributed the rise in 
minority applicants and

.,enrollees to a 2003 Supreme 
Court decision on affirmative 
action, which sanctioned a limit-
ed use of race in university 
admissions for the purpose of 
achieving diversity. 

"AAMC believes the increases 
in black and Hispanic enrollment 

indicate that medical schools view 
the court's decision as providing 
support for their efforts to assem-
ble a diverse medical school 
class," the group stated in a press 
release.

Regents reject 'multiracial' category 
Connerly likens current system to Jim Crow 

By PATIICK AWN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UC Board of Regents' 
committee on education policies 
voted 12-1 against a proposal urg-
ing the UC Office of the 
President to challen,e federal 
regulations in order to add a 
"multiracial" ca~80ry on the eth-
nic data portion of the university\ 
admissions application. 

Accordin,.l ,. to tile fed~raJ 
l't 0( . Mlnllgement and 

Buct,et's Direcme 15, universi-
ties should forgo any changes to 
current methods of collecting 
racial data pending further 
instructions from the federal 
~eDt. 

Despite these instructions, UC 
RlFnt Ward Connerly proposed 
• ehange that would have created 

an all-encompassing category for 
students who consider themselves 
memben of more than one racial 
group . . 

Currently, students who 
check more than one ethnicity 
are ISsigned a single ethnicity by 
the university. The university 
uses a mathematical algorithm to 
assign the students to the least-
represented ethnicity among 
those that they check, according 
to UCOP spokesman Brad 
Hayward. 

According to Connerly, the 
university's system for determin-
ing applicant's race is compara-
ble to racist Jim Crow laws, 
under which any amount of 
African-American ancestry was 
sufficient to classify a person as 
black. 

"The collapsing decisions are 

guided by a policy that has its ori-
gins in slavery and the Jim Crow 
era known as the one-drop rule," 
Connerly said. "The student is 
not consulted about this decision 
and a claim of having iI system 
based on self-identification 
becomes hypocritical at that 
point." 

Connerly continued to cri-
tique the university's policy by 
comparing the racial classification 
systems to the Nazi practice of 
segregating people based on visu-
al inspections. 

In the monthly meeting of the 
regents on Nov. 17, members of 
the board found fault in 
Connerly's logic and cited rea-
sons in opposition to the propos-
al, including the lack of knowl -

Co-op lease deadline 

passes with no eviction 
Though the Nov. 14 lease termination dead-

line has expired, the university has not initiated 
eviction proceedings against the student co-ops. 

Associated Students, the Graduate Student 
Association and the University Centers Advisory 
Board originally had until Oct 15 under a uni-

and the Memorandum of Understanding. 
which sovem the way the co·ws lease cam-

to evid the co-{)ps if new agreements were not 
formulated by that date. 

A.S. President Jenn Pae said she has not 
received any communication from the univer-
sity regarding the co-ops' eviction. 

On Nov. 4, the negotiating parties signed a 
confidentiality agreement as part of the terms

Bush names adviser to 
head education department 

President George W. Bush has nominated 
Margaret Spellings - a friend and former educa-
tion adviser from Bush's days as gcNeII10r of Texas 
- to head the U.S. Department of Education. 

"If confi rmed by the Senate, I commit to 
work alongside America's educators and my

Education to make our schools the finest in the 
world: Spellings said at the White House 
announcement of her nomination.

Spellings' nomination came two days after 
current Department of Education Secretary Rod 
Paige officially announced his resignation, 
pointing out that he will have served longer 
than any Republican education secretary at the 
end of the president's first term. 

In a personal letter to Bush, Paige praised the

test scores among radal minorities. 

Emp~ent IookiI1J brighter 
for college gracfuate5 

Employers expect to increase their college hir-
ing by 13.1 percent in N.l4{)5, a great irrlpn:we-
ment t:Ner past et'fllIo'rment figures. the annual 
Job Outlook survey by the National Association of 
Colleges and Employers has found. 

More than 80 percent of executives ques-
tioned rated the job market for college graduates 
as "good: "very good" or "excellent," according 
to the survey, compared to 38 percent last ~r. 

'We're seeing a number of positive indica-
tions that the JOD market for new college grad-
uates is improving." NACE Executive Director 
Marilyn Mackes said. 

In addition, seven out of 10 respondents to 
the survey suggested they expect to increase their 
starting salary Offers to new graduates ~ badr 
elar's degrees, the annual report stated. On <Ner-
age. they predicted an increase of 3.7 percent 

The job outlook remained most promising 
for graduates with degrees in business, engi-
neering and computer-related fields. 

A separate NACE sUIVey released earlier in 
November showed that tumover among new 
col~e hires has also dropped to its lowest 
levelm 12 years. 

Students planninJ increased 
political involVement 

Young voters, who turned out in record num-
bers on Nov. 2, S<I'( they plan to become more 
active in politics, according to a national post-
election poll commissioried by nOfllc1rtisan, 
nonprofit voter-tumout group Declare YourseH. 

The 2004 eledion saw an emergence of 
increased political participation by students 
and other young people on both Sides of the 
political spectrum, the group reported on Nov. 
16, predicting that young voters between 1 B 
and 29 years of age 'will be even more critical" 
in future elections: possibly leading to a 
"Decade of the Young Voter~ 

Of the young adu~ voters surveyed, 75 per-
cent said they planned to become more polit-
ically active in the future and 46 percent said 
they would register and vote in the next elec-
tion. Five percent said they would opt out of 
the political process. 

Though young people use network and 
cable news as their primary source of informa-
tion. they said they trusted Comedy Central's 
"Daily Show" host Jon Stewart more than the 
three most respected network news anchors. 
according to the group.

State senator blames 
govemor for budget 

Education threatened, 
Vasconcellos warns campus 

By AMY IFURUNG 
Staff Writer 

Retiring State Sen. John 
Vasconcellos (D-San Jose) 
accused Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger of being "more 
about money than education" at a 
campus meeting with a small 
audience of graduate students, 
staff and faculty on Nov. 15. 

With public higher education in 
the state facing severe budget cuts, 
the senator said he is unsure of the 
furure of the UC system and other 
public higher education instiru-
tions in the state. Vasconcellos 
pointed to Schwarzenegger as the 
"absolute key- to finding a solu-
tion. 

"Within the past year, [the gov-
ernor) has cut financial aid and he's 
cut enrollment. Fixing this crisis all 
depends on if the governor has the 
courage to put education first," 
Vasconcellos said. 

The senator implored students 
to act as well, encouraging them 
to "speak up" in politics in order 
to reach the goal of increased 
state funding for higher educa-
tion. 

"Students are surprised when 
they hear about actually talking 
with the government to get what 
they want - they're afraid," 
Vasconcellos said. "If kids roll out 
their sleeping bags and camp in 
front of the governor's office, I'd 
say there's a good chance they'll get 
to speak with (Sch-.... arzenegger) 

within 48 hours. " 
Vasconcellos' visit, hosted bv 

the political science department, 
was one of nearly 100 stOpS in the 
farewell tour around the state the 
senator calls hiS 
"caVVlCTORY/lap." 

"I woke up one morning six 
months ago and thought, ']'ve lived 
such a privileged life,' so I made 
the decision to thank a II the people 
that have helped me lead that li fe ," 
he said. 

In addition to, showing grati-
rude, however, Vasconcellos also 
criticized the current state of 
California politics, calling it 
"dread full y cynical, dirty and 
destructi ve. " 

The senator challenged the 
audience to remedy the problem 
with counteractive tactics such a 
"social inclusion" and "collabora-
tion." Namely, Vasconcellos urged 
listeners to join his Politics of Trust 
Network. 

A nonpartisan coalition of state 
and local legislators as well a 
California citizens, PTN serves as 
a resource for promoting humanis-
tic ideals in politics. Plans for PT N 
include an online communi ty as 
well as a "training insti tute" 
designed to teach new legislators 
about their roles as state lawmak-
ers. PTN currently has 3,500 
members. 

"My politics is about healing 
- it's about trust and family,"

International students 
" hurt by visa processes 
By dragging their feet, memoers of Con ress have jeopardizel the 
ability of American univer-
sities to compete for the 
most qualified students and 
scholars in the world. 

Policies adopted after 
Sept. 11 , including exces-
sively stringent student 
visa regulations, have ham-
pered higher education 
Institutions' ability to 
recruit international stu-
dents, as two new indepen-
dent studies have shown, 
and may threaten the 
future of domestic innova-
tion in technology and 
knowledge. 

For the first time since 
197 1, enroll men t of forei gn 
students declined nationally 
this fall after more than 
three decades of growth. A 
separate report by the 
Council of Graduate 
Schools has logged three 
years of falling numbers 
among member institu-
tions. 

However, Congress has 
yet to act on the visa reforms 
advocated by a large coali-

tion of higher education 
groups and endorsed by the 
Government Accountability 
Office since last February, 
which would keep America 
competi tive internationally. 
In fact, instead of acknowl-
edging the problem, Sen. 
Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) 
has blamed "censored or 
biased media outlets" in the 
home countries of foreign 
applicants - a slap in the 
face to American allies like 
India and South Korea, 
where students have faced 
some of the sharpest 
declines in admittance to 
American universities. 

Universities have done 
their part by streamlining 
applications and providing 
counseling to students. 
Now Congress must do 
theirs and reduce the wait 
and procedural red tape 
around student visas. 

Instead of the current 
policy of American isola-
tionism, an open door to 
international students is 
necessary to counter the 
misinformation that breeds 
hatred and intolerance. 

Paige's resignation is 
good news for students 
T he decision by U.S. Secretary of Education Ron Paige to leave his 
post at the Department of 
Education is a much-wel-
comed move for universities. 
Now that President George 
W. Bush has appointed 
Margaret Spellings to 
replace him, she must put the 
interests of students before 
politics. 

During his four-year 
term, Paige accomplished 
little of value for college 
students. While the admin-
istration emphasized 
reforming secondary edu-
cation, Paige failed to advo-
cate for increased financial 
aid within the administra-
tion - the top Pell Grant 
remained nearly stagnant 
- and the department 
failed to correct a Clinton-
era mistake that denied fed-
eral money to smdents con-
victed of dmg offenses. 

In fact, in his resignation 
letter, Paige fails to men-

tion one higher education 
initiative, though he praises 
the improvements made to 
his department's Web site. 

When a comprehensive 
study by the American 
Federation of Teachers 
showed that public school 
achievement far outdis-
tanced that of administra-
tion-backed charter schools, 
Paige lashed out at the news-
papers that reported the 
story instead of facing the 
problem. The department 
also launched an unprece-
dented effort to refute the 
study, which critics argued 
might have violated normal 
department procedures. 
Several months earlier, in a 
loss of judgment, Paige 
called the teacher's union a 
"terrorist organization." 

It is now imperative for 
Spellings, who is held in 
high regard by the educa-
tion community, to repre-
sent the needs of lifelong 
learners in all age groups.

UCSD's recendy heightened

most notably, the recent inception 
of the UCSD Farmer's Marleet-

From bra--burners to Britney Spears: Feminism has 
followed a strange trajectory since its conception 

Vendors: 
Campus 

eateries have 
major faults Living DeliBerate 

Robin Averbeck 

I was accosted the other day on Library Walk by a team of do-gooders who wanted me to 
help with a production of "The 
Vagina Monologues." Of course, I 
didn't quite understand that they 
were "do-gooders" until they 
explained that they were a group 
working against violence toward 
women; before that, I was rather 
confused why they were asking me 
to help with their play. Because 
their purpose was so admirable I 
decided to humor them for a 
while, but I walked away contem-
plating exactly why it was the 
whole affair struck me as some-
what strange. 

Feminism today is an obscure 
word. It seems to be floating in a 
decendy undefined and malleable 
plasmasphere. We are far away 
from the '60s or '70s, when femi-
nism clearly evoleed images of bra-
burning and otherwise angry 
women. Today, it seems anyone 
can claim to be a feminist. Is this 
because there are no longer battles 
to be fought, or is it simply 
because they are more subde? 

Whatever the exact cause, the 
irony can run very thick at times. 
There is the lurking danger in our 
society for feminism to do a pen-
dulum swing; now that we are sex-
ually liberated, we are completely 
free to make sex objects out of 
ounelYeS to our heart's content. 
When the lilees of Britney Spears 

explain their music and videos as 
merely "self-expression," I am not 
entirely sure that's the kind of self-
expression that early activists dis-
carded their supportive garments 
for - corporate society has 
always, after all, been more than 
willing to allow women to 'express 
their semality. So the question 
begs to be asked: Is that all these 
women have to express? Spears 

and self-discovery in general, but 
the fact that this is all done 
through the medium of the vagi-
na is an anachronism; the femi-
nist movement needs to expand 
beyond sexual liberation. 

I was raised in a relatively con-
servative family, perfectly nuclear 
with Mom, Dad and sibling. I 
lived in a small country town that 
could hardly be called worldly. Yet 

might aspire to be 
like Madonna, but 
Madonna is an 
artist, and she is, 
well, a nice pieCe of 
ass. " 

never once in my 
entire life have I 
felt sexually 
repressed by 
patriarchal insti-
tutions. Growing 
up, it wasn't con-
cerns about a 
sense of shame 
my girlfriends 
talked about - it 
was their sense of 
annoyance that 
they hadn't yet 
lost their virgini-
ty. How many 
girls out there 
lamented in their 
diary that they 
were unable to 
participate in

but it also helped 
me realize what 
was confusing me: 
I don't entirely see 
why sexuality - as 
embodied by the 

new priorities in 
what feminism 

_1.1... " uuuresses. 

. apparently mysti-
cal vagina - is the starting point 
for female empowerment. There 
has been a mystification of 
female sexuality that runs entire-
lyon emotion; if you realJy want 
to be non-sexist, there is nothing 

. more spirirual about a female 
orgasm than a male's. Yet, some-
how, a physical organ is worleed 
up in this play to the point of 
worship. Of course, it is analo-
gous to female empowerment 

"Truth Or 
Dare?" The 

pressures on all sides, from peers 
to the media to those evil teen 
magazines, were pushing us to 
believe that as girls, one of our 
primary purposes was to have 
crushes on boys and be objects of 
sexual beauty, hence all those 
bulimic episodes in the school 
bathroom. 

I haven't been around long 
enough to know if this is nothing 
new, or perhaps getting worse, but 

I do not thinlc: this was the style of 
feminism intended by the activist 
generation. Their feminism has 
largely been hijacked - people 
like Spears really believe they 
stand for self-empowerment and 
sexual liberation, rather than bla-
tant exploitation, and the whole 
social discourse gets pollmed. An 
entirely new feminism is now in 
order; the generation of girls born 
after the activist years are now 
young women, and there should be 
new priorities in what feminism 
addresses. I would like to know, for 
example, why I cannot carry on a 
conversation with a guy a t a party 
without people assuming I want to 
sleep with him that night. I would 
be interested in discovering what is 
going through the heads of young 
models who willingly subject 
themselves to objectification. I also 
wonder why so many wonderful 
girls insist on treating themselves 
lilee fast-food restaurants with 
malee-out drive-thrus. 

Feminism should first and 
foremost be about self-respect. 
Only from this starting point can 
young women start to discover 
and empower themselves. 
Anything built around a structure 
lacking this central foundation will 
ultimately flounder, no matter 
how sexually liberated we are. 
Ultimately, it isn't even about 
women - imagine a world where 
we all based our interactions with 
one another on respect - where 
we all wlued ourselves and each 
other as highly as we ought to. You 
certainly wouldn't have Spears 
malcing millions off future eating 
disorders, that's for sure.

Imagination in philosophy is a very different thing from imagination

possibility. But impossible things happen in art all the time, and we 

imagine them happening when we engage with a picture or book. Even 
fictional imagining bas a seemingly inexplicable limit, though. It is 
hard to imagine of morally bad things that they are good or of good

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. NOVEMBER lB. 2004 

Medicine: Proposition 209 blamed for initial drop 
continued from page 1 

However, UCSD School of 
Medicine operates under 
Proposition 209, which California 
voters passed in 1996, prohibiting 
ethnic consideration as a factor in 
university admissions processes. 
After the proposition's passage, the 
medical schools Hispanic enroll-
ment dropped from 82 in 1997 to 
49 in 1998, according to Daley. 

"Minorities weren't applying 
after the [proposition passed) 
because they didn't feel that they 
were welcomed by the professional 
schools," she said. "So they felt, 
'Why even try?'" 

However, since 2000, Hispanic 
enrollment has seen a small but 
steady incremental increase, Daley 
said. Forty-four Hispanic students 
are currendy errrolled at UCSD 
School of Medicine, as opposed to 
32 in 2000. 

Kelly attri buted the gradual 
increase to ou treach efforts by the 
campus. 

"[The medical school) has put a 
lot of work into outreach activities 
and building the p.ipeline in the 
community to make minority stu-
dents better aware of the opportu-
nities available for them and to 
better prepare them to successful-
ly compete with other applicants 
for admission," she said. 

The medical school currently 
works with Sweetwater Union 
High School and National City 
High School in providing a year-
round academic enrichment pro-
gram that includes on-campus 
summer research activities for 
approximately 80 students, 
according to Daley. The school 
also provides services for commu-
nity colleges, including a summer 
residential program for transfer 
students, and visits the college 
campuses to wo.rk with students 
on skills for taking standardized 
tests. 

"We spend a lot of time trying 
to inform advisers in the under-

graduate and community college 
setting on how to prepare a com-
petitive student and how to advise a 
student in the application as well as 
the interview process," Daley said. 

The school's applicants go 
through several screening 
processes, according [0 Kelly. The 
first stage is the American Medical 
College Application Service, 
which applicants use to submit 
transcripts, Medical College 
Admission Test scores, informa-
tion about extracurricular activi-
ties and a personal essay. After 
evaluation of those factors, the 
university sends qualified appli-
cants a campus-specific applica-
tion, which requests letters of ree-
.:>mmendation and an autobio-
graphical statement. 

"The statement aUows the stu-
dent to tell us if they are of a disad-
vantaged socioeconomic back-
ground," Kelly said. 

The campus' efforts to reach 
disadvantaged studentS through 
academic enrichment programs 
have built a competitive and diverse 
group of applicants, according to 

Daley. 
While the increasing minority 

enrollment is encouraging, more 
progress is needed , according to 
AAMC President Jordan ]. Cohen . 

"Our nation must find ways to 
strengthen the pipeline of acade-
mically qualified minor ity stu-
dents so that the education of 
tomorrow's doctors , and ultimate-
ly the health care of all Americans, 
will reap the benefits of diversity," 
he stated. 

Berkeley professor of ethnic 
studies Carlos Munoz said he also 
believes that, while AAMC's statis-
tics are promising, they still do not 
accurately reflect proportional 
minority representation. 

"I'm happy there has been 
improvement, but in the final 
analysis, this is a drop in the 
bucket," he said. "It doesn't come 
close to the representation of the 
population at large. AAMC still 
has a lot to do to reach out to 
minorities. "

expansion, according to university 
documents. 

The rest of the costs will be paid 
by bookstore reserves, gift funds 
for the alumni center and money 
designated by the university for the 
new Cross-Cultural Center. 

Construction begins in 
January 2006 and will be com-
pleted in fall 2007, according to 
the uni versity. 

Supercomputer outgrows facility 
Under the approved plans, cur-

rent facili ties of the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center will be 
expanded to include the area now 
occupied by a nearby parking lot, 
doubling the size of the original 
center. 

"There's been a lot of growth 
and funding of research," SDSC 
Chief of Operations Anke 
Kamrath said. "In fact, over the 
last seven years, our staff has 
tripled in size, so we need more 
space." 

One quarter of the center's 
397-member staff works away 
from the main building due to 
lack of room in the original struc-
ture, according to university doc-
uments. 

The center's staff is also pro-
jected to grow an additional 70 
percent by 2009, further intensi-
fying the need for an expansion. 

The challenges of dealing with a 
spread-out staff and the growing 
space necessary fOf newer super-
computers were factors that neces-
sitated increased space, according 
to Kamrath. 

"Computers today are using 
more power and more cooling 
equipment. Our supercomputer is 
outgrowing its infrastructure," she 
said. 

The expansion will COSt nearly 
542 million and will be funded 
through a "Garamendi funding 
approach," according to 
Kamrath . The method uses a spe-
cial provision in the state's gov-
ernment code that allows "Iong-
term scientific research activities" 
in the UC system to borrow 
money and then repay it through 
the increased revenue brought to 
the university from federal con-
tracts and grants. 

Construction on the expansion 
is expected to begin January 2006 
and will be completed by October 
2007. 

Rady school facility appnnoed 
The regents approved the first 

phase of construction of facilities 
for Rady School of Management at 
the Nov. 4 meeting of the commit-
tee on grounds and buildings, 
according to the school's dean, 
Robert S. Sullivan. 

"This is the first totally private-
ly funded building on this campus," 
Sullivan said. "Industry individuals 
and supporters of UCSD have 
played an important role in our 
school." 

According to a document from 
the UC Office of the President, the 
new facility will cost $31 million to 
construct, and is funded exclusively 
by "private gift funds." 

Located north of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, the L-shaped 
building will contain four stories 
and consist of instructional rooms 
on three floors, according to the 
document. 

The Rady school is currendy 
located on the third floor of 
Pepper Canyon Hall and will 
remain there until the new facility 
is completed. 

"There have been studies done 

in San Diego indicating that, in 
order for this community to grow 
economically, it needs to have an 
internationally recognized gradu-
ate school of management that 
would be among the best in the 
world," Sullivan said. "Industry 
needs the school, the community 
wanted it and the leadership of the 
campus wanted it." , 

AccordiDg to Sullivan, construc-
tion on phase one of the projeet 
will begin on Jan. 21 and will be 
completed in August 2006. In 
phase two, a similar building, sepa-
rated by a courtyard, will begin 
shortly after the first part is fin-
ished and the necessary private 
funds have been raised. 

Structure to increase parking 
Set to be built on the east side of 

Ridge Walk in Eleanor Roosevelt 
College, the Hopkins Parking 
Structure has been designed to 
"serve the North Campus, 
RIMAC, as well as the Warren 
College area," according to 
Transportation and Parking 
Services Director Greg Snee. 

The stnJcture has a price tag of 
530 million and will contain 1,418 
parking spaces when completed. 

"The cost of the parking con-
struction is self-supported by the 
users of the facility, so there is no 
outside funding from the UC 
Regents or UCOP," Snee said. 
"They are involved, however, in 
securing the approvals." 

Accordin~ to campus senior 
architect Chris Cocallas, the 
Hopkins Parking Structure project 
is scheduled to begin in February 
2005 and be completed by July 
2006.

7,000 UC-eligible students to save 
S4S million. 

"Somehow, saving $45 million 
on one hand and breaking a promise 
to Californians while paying $200 
million in salary increases didn't 
make • lot of sense," Speier said. 

Speier said she hopes to rede-
fine the struCture of funding and 
goals for UC outreach programs in 
the future by focusing on younger 
children. 

"We've funded outreach pro-
grams, and theres no accountabili-
ty. We don't Icnow where the 
money goes," she said. -If it\ all 
about having [the UC system) go 
out to high school campuses and 
say 'Hi, we're here, come apply,' it's 
not going to change the number of 
minority students that are attend-
ing here. What is going to change 
it is if you can prepare them in 
grammar school." 

Student leaders, including mem-
bers of the A.S. Council and the 
Student Affirmative Action 
Committee, were especially con-
cerned about cuts in outreach pro-
grams such as student-initiated out-
reach. The program holds wUversi-
ty conferences that aim to motivate 
local disadvantaged high school stu-
dents to pursue a UC education. 
According to A.S. President Jenn 
Pae, student-initiated outreach 
holds six conferences annualJy that 
host 300 to 400 students, but the 
program has reeendy experienced 
large funding cuts. 

Speier questioned the spending 
ethic of the program and said that 
the conferences could still be effec· 
tive under a smaller budget. 

"I think it's a very valuable pro-

dent and you have 1,800 students, 
that's just 536,000," she said. "You 
can do a lot with $20 per student. 
Parr of what state government is all 

about today is to do more with less." 
The student leaders also spoke on 

adler outteac:h program cuts, such as 
VICe OIanceIlor of Student Affairs 
Joseph w. Wat5On\ proposed budget 
reduction of Early Academic 
Outreach Program. FAOP's pro-
posed budget severely reduces the 
staff and service at local schook, 
SMC chair Emily Leach said. 

"We have a lot of theory goin~ 
around on how to ezpand opportu-
nities and increase errrollmcnt, but 
the outreach programs keep getting 
cut," Revelle College Senior 
Senator Ted McCombs said. "I get 
frustrated with the rhetoric on cam-
pus on how we value diversiry while 
EAOP gets its budget cut by half." 

EAOP needs to come into

dents, according to Speier. 
. "I think we need to redefine it," 

she said. "I think we've been doing 
it the same way for a long time. I 
would bet you that the conferences 
have 'a more profound effect than 
EAOP. I don't think that just 
because something existed, that it is 
th_e answer to expanding access to 
the university. There are lots of dif-
ferent ways, and this is a lot of 
money [for EAOP)." 

Students also expressed concern 
about the diversion of funds from 

lur ..... te • . 11I 

UCSD to Preuss School, a univer-
sity-run charter middle and high 
school. 

"The problem we're faced with 
is that the money allocated to the 
charter school is coming out of 
money that is supposed to be allo-
cated to the university," Pae said. 
"HaYing that $1 million commit-
ment [to Preuss) jeopardizes stu-
dent-initiated outreach and EAOP." 

McCombs questioned the use-
fulness of funding Preuss. 

"I think the Preuss School is a 
wondcrful idea, but I don't mow if 
the UC's role is to take on the chal-
lenge of refonning how K-12 is 
done in San Diego," McCombs said. 

Speier, however, applauded the 
results of the school. Of the first 
graduating class, 91 percent went 
on to college, and 50 percent 
errrolled in a UC school, according 
to Speier. 

"[fhe graduating class results) 
are stupendous," she said. "If it 
could happen here, it could happen 
to any low-performing school in 
the state. It would give every first-
generation child in a low-income 
home hope. It makes the case." 
Speier reiterated her outreach 
focus toward younger students by 
expressing support for funding 
tutors for low-income, low-per-
fonning children. 

"We lenow that if you don't take 
algebra by the time you're in sev-
enth grade, and you don't take cal-
culus by the time you're in junior 
or senior year, you will not go on to 
the sciences," Speier said. "And we 
lenow that the only jobs that are 
going to be worth their salt are 
going to be jobs that are math- and 
science-based. If we don't prepare 
our kids to take on those jobs, we 
will be outsourcing jobs."

Death: College to offer counseling 
conrinued from page I 

Prior to her death, Cho 
exhibited symptoms of 
depression, according to 
Jones. 

"There were some signs 
of depression," he said. 
"People don't do these 
things in a vacuum, they do 
it for a reason. It's an unfor-
tunate, permanent solution 
to a temporary condition." 

Friends said Cho had 
struggled with the recent 
accidental death of her 
boyfriend and was under 
stress from other personal 
challenges. 

However, she had not 
sought help from campus 
resources, according to 
friend Hannah Tchon, a 
Roosevelt sophomore, and 
she had never discussed 
with friends any plans to 
tak.e her own life. 

Though naturally quiet, 
Cho opened up her heart to 
a small group of intimate 
friends, but even they did 
not know the degree of her 

sorrow, Tchon said. Since 1983, the UCSD

Race: Change would violate regulations 
conrinued from page I 

edge of possible implica-
tions. 

"The fact of the matter is 
not what box we checL: but 
how we're using this data," 
ex-officio Regent and 
Speaker of the State 
Assembly Fabian Nunez 
said. 

UC President Robert C. 
Dynes was also opposed to 
the changes proposed by 
Connerly. 

"1 do not believe that we, 
as the university, have a suf-
ficiently thorough under-
standing of the implications 
nor a sufficiently compelling 
mandate from the students 
we surveyed to request a 
change at this time," Dynes 
said. 

Dynes said that issues 
wi th the existing system 
needed attention and possi-
ble reform but feared that 
Connerly's proposal would 
interrupt the data trends 
that tracL: the demographics 
of the student body. 

The university uses the 
current methodology in 
order to comply with feder-
al reporting guidelines, 
which only allow one eth-
nicity for each student, 

Hayward said. These regu-
lations date from the time 
when students were allowed 
to marL: only one ethnicity, 
but are currently under 
review. 

Minority advocates also 
challenged Connerly's crit-
icism of the university's 
current classification sys-
tem. 

"The University of 
California chooses the eth-
nicity that wiJI help students 
of mixed race. No one is 
going to complain about 
getting the upper hand," 
said Janice Fitch, co-presi-
dent of the Hapa 
Multiethnic Identity 
Students Community at 
UCSD. "But the multiracial 
category is a civil rights vio-
lation in some ways because, 
in this case, 'multiracial' is 
just another word for 
'other' [whlch is not used 
for statistical purposes) ." 

During its meeting on 
Nov. 10, the A.S . Council 
passed a resolution oppos-
ing Connedy's proposal. 
Among its reasons, the 
council cited the fact that 
the multiracial category 
would limit the ability of 
the university to collect 

information on its multira-
cial students. 

"A multiracial box disen-
franchises students because 
it undermines the students' 
ability to be accurately 
counted," A.S. President 
Jenn Pae said. "There is 
always room for improve-
ment lin existing systems) 
but a blanket term is worse. 
Students should still be able 
to marL: their different eth-
nicities." 

The resolution was draft-
ed by Student Affirmative 
Action Committee Chair 
Emily Leach . After its 
approval by the council, the 
council sent the resolution 
to the regents, UC Office of 
the Presidenr, the UC 
Student Association, UCSD 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
and UCSD Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph W. 
Watson. 

"Students checking the 
multiracial box would 
become invisible," Leach 
said. "It would block the 
collection of information 
from multiracial students 
and that is illegal."

Vasconcellos said. "I don't 
think the public is going to 
deal much longer with this 
negative, cynical, dismis-
sive politics. Nor should 
they." 

Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. 
Watson also attended the 
event. He and Vasconcellos 
have been acquaintances 
since the development of 
Thurgood MarshaU College 
in the 19705. 

"Sen. Vasconcellos has 
always talcen a great interest 
in the development of 
UCSD, and he's always 
been very supportive of the 
campus," Watson said. 

1rhe senator thanked 
Watson for his help during 
Vasconcellos' political ser-
vice, mentioning Watson's 
"integral role in making 
UCSD become one of the 
most pre-eminent campuses 
in the country." 

Vasconcellos was also 

involved in education at the 
state level, filling such roles 
as the chairman cf both the 
State Senate's education 
committee and the Master 
Plan Review Committee of 
the State Assembly in the 
early 19705. 

The senator also 
addressed the challenges 
facing students in primary 
and secondary schools, 
blaming Schwarzenegger 
for a lack of credentialed 
teachers and the presence of 
unsafe buildings. 

"With this new gover-
nor, it's the poor kids in the 
barrios and the ghettos who 
aren't getting the education 
they need. Educating them 
is not only a nice idea - itls 
morally correct," 
Vasconcellos said. 

A spokesperson from 
the governor's office did 
not return a call for com-
ment on the senator's state-
ment. 

Arriving on campus early 

for breakfast with "former 
Chancellor and UC 
President Richard C. 
Atkinson, the senator held 
his meeting before complet-
ing hls visit with a tour of 
Preuss School, a cha"er 
middle and high school run 
by the university. 

"The state really loses a 
great deal when a legislator 
with this amount of knowl-
edge and wisdom retires," 
Watson said. 

On Nov. 3D, 
Vasconcellos will end his 
tour with a ceremony in his 
own district of San Jose, 
Calif. 

"I want to get rested, 
decomprascd, and do what 
I want to do. I want to 
return to the piano and read 
the thousands of novels I've 
collected," Vasconcellos 
said.

Blo.de Redhead 
Misery Is a Butterfly 

Southern 

If Blonde Redhead were to ever compose the soundtrack for an artsy 
romantic French film, this 
wOlild be it. In fact, Mistry 
is a Butterfly ranks Blonde 
Redhead as the Claude 
Debussy of modern rock. 
Chewing this change may 
prove difficult for Blonde 
Redhead purists, like red-
necks having trouble 
digesting fine French cui-
sine. 

To that, I say "bol-
locks." This change is more 
than welcome. For nearly, a 
decade Blonde Redhead 
have gra<:,ed the under-

ground rock world with No 
Wave explorations, 
inspired by DNA and early 
Sonic Youth. Blonde 
Redhead's 1997 album, 
Fake Clm Be Just lIS Good, is 
a successful blueprint of 
what modern No Wave 
should sound like. Sadly, 
this success has led critics 
to pin the band as just 
another derivative of Sonic 
Youth. 

Misery is a Butterfly 
silences such criticism. 
This work moves far away 
from the quirky, dissonant, 
guitar-dominated songs 
Blonde Redhead are known 
for. To top that, there isn't 
a si ngle trace of guitar 
feedback' Instead, the band 
relies on simple, beautiful 
melodies with worldly 
instrumentation. Perhaps 
the band finds their No 
Wave flirtations to be 
passe, but its .current fasci-
nation with art-flavored 
world pop is a welcomed 
step into a new world. 

Blonde Redhead will 
perform with Liars at 
Canes on Nov. 22.

Encore 
Shady 

If creative liberty is earned by success, Eminem's got it in 
spades. But on his fourth 
full-length, Encort, creative 
rranslarcs to self-indulgent. 
After some of the usual 
autobiographical drivel, 
Eminem embraces his 
inner 12 -year-old for most 
of the record, burying his 
best songs past the one-
hour mark. 

Eminem's albums have 
never been as buoyant as 
his lead singles would sug-
gest, but "J ust Lose It" 
stands alone as the sole 
moment of true (if irritat-

ing) catchiness on the 
record. At other times, like 
in the grating "My First 
Single," it's clear that 
though ht's having . fun, 
we're hearing musical mas-
turbation. (It~ doubtful that 
anybody enjoys £art sounds 
quite as much as Eminem 
does, but rejoice jf you do, 
because they're on no less 
than four songs.) 

Eminem jwnps for (and 
misses) the anti-Bush band-
wagon on "Mosh," but at 
least Bush won; if he'd lost, 
the song would have come 
off as inspirational, and 
"Lose Yourself" was quite 
enough of that. At least 
now it's just depressing. 

The man's sJcill as an 
MC can carry even a 
mediocre record, and the 
production picks up as the 
record winds down with the 
Dr. Dre-produced title 
track and the trigger-happy 
"One Shot 2 Shot," featur-
ing D12. Eminem won't 
lose his throne, but Encore 
shouldn't make much of a 
contribution to any "Best-
ors" either.

Avril Lavlpe 
UnderMyS~n 

Arista 

My biggest gripe about Avril has always been her "I'm-so-punk-
and-I'm-such-a-rebel" atti-
tude, which so many 13-
year-olds fell for. Of course, 
it was nothing more than a 
facade, and as her lackluster 
second album Umhr My 
Skin clearly illustrates, 
underneath the "tough-girl" 
attitude, studded belts and 
badly applied eyeliner, she's 
just as whiny and irritating 
as the Hilary Duffs and 
AshIee Simpsons out there. 

Lavigne's sophomore 
endeavor is 40 minutes of a 
trite and boring attempt at 

There is an option. 

explaining the so-aLle4 
complexities of a teenage 
girl. Take some pretty basic 
guitar chords and some 
poorly written Iyries about 
how she's A) bored; B) 
pissed off, or C) bored and 
pissed off, and you have 
Lavigne's album. 

Granted, her "Sk8er 
Hoi" is now out of the pic-
ture, but Avril's new man 
isn't all that picture perfect. 
From fighting off the over-
enthusiastic, horny 
boyfriend in "Don't Tell 
Me" ("Did you think that I 
was gonna give it up to you 
this time?"), to (shock, hor-
ror) the boy who didn't treat 
her right ("He wouldn't 
even open up the door"), I 
guess things are a little more 
complicated than they were 
two years ago. Strange, 
since her work doesn't 
reflect that and is still as 
simplistic and dull as ever. 
And, for the record, there~ 
nothing punk abour wear-
ing a tie over a wife-beater. 

Avril Lavigne will per-
form at Cox Arena on Nov. 
20.

Controversial Kinsey biopic illustrates 
Americans' ambivalence toward sex 
ay IIUY SAIMI-PEAICE 

Contributing Writer 

Soon after the explosive release of his myth-shattering study, "Sexual Behavior in the 
Human Male," a reporter asked sex 
researcher Alfred Kinsey if he had 
"any plans for a motion picture." 
Kinsey replied, "I can't think of 
anything more pointless." I'd love 
to agree. After all, considering that 
writer/director Bill Condon's new 
biopic "Kinsey" doesn't explore the 
most controversial aspects of the 
tide character, this movie should be 
nothing more than a nostalgic 'look 
back at how sexually ignorant the 
American public once was. But it 
im't. 

In Condon's new survey of sci-
entific Iighming rod Kinsey, played 
to perfection by Liam Neeson, 
only a few scenes come off as 
antique: a young couple concerned 
that oral sell would cause sterility, 
for example, elicits comfortable 
laughs. But most of the film is all 
tOO familiar - the raging battles 
over sell education in public 
schools seem to have frozen in time 
since Kinsey first published his 
eye-opening manuscript and shook 
church foundations across the 
country. 

The fact is, the Kinsey revolu-
tion only pushed the door halfway 
open. While the male study was a 
hit, the subsequent female volume 
struck a raw nerve; the backlash 
was strong enough that today, 
issues such as female masturba-
tion remain as taboo as they were 
five decades ago. Much of the 
film's humor comes from the jux-
taposition of 'SOs styles with ideas 
about sex that are still jarring 
today. Laura Linney masterfully 
entbediet thit C8'Ul'lft " KiMey's 
wife, Clara, and though she learns 
to enjoy the open marriage that

REVIEW 

have pushed her into, she'd still 
rather discuss pot roast than poli-
ties, 

At the eye of this tornado is 
Kinsey himself, a simple and 
socially awkward scientist who 
draws on his studies of insects (a 
trait he aggressively denies) to 
classify human behavior. Neeson, 
who refreshingly ages 40 years for 
the film, nails the role of the biol-
ogist: straightforward, gawky and 
mathematical. Kinsey's failure to 
separate science from his personal 
Ii fe is his tragic flaw, one to which 
the audience can be safely sympa-
thetic . 

In one sense, Condon stream-
lines and simplifies the story 
much as educators did sex in the 
1950s, editing out any bits 
deemed too uncomfortable for 
the audience. In a scene intended 
to discredit still-frequent asser-
tions that Kinsey was sympathetic 
to pedophiles. Kinsey interviews 
the sex-addicted Kenneth Braun 
(William Sadler). Condon plays 
the audience brilliantly: Laughs 
turn to squirms as the predatory 
Braun tries to find common moral 
ground with Kinsey. Instead, 
Kinsey comes through for the 
nervous audience, offering the 
pedophile a backhanded condem-
nation that elicits sighs of relief. 
Effective? Yes. Oversimplified? 
Certainly. 

Though Condon only prods at 
Kinsey the man, he uses a stunning 
cameo by Lynn Redgrave to drive 
home the power of the Kinsey 
feg:II:Y. The film's final and moS[ 
romantic scene is beautifully asexu-
al and offers a surprising vision of 
monogamous true love. Condon 
opts to tie up Kinsey's personal life 
neatly, but more relevant is the 
gaping stagnation of social 
progress over the last few decades 
that the film brings to light. While 
Kinsey's work explosively kicked 
off the semaI revolution, Condon~ 
film reminds us that it is nowhere 
near complete.

Fist splits: Sophomore Jacob Dong won the 200-yard breaststroke event. followed by senior teammate Bre\t Going and freshman Derek Pettit for the sweep. 

continued from page ,6 
The depth of the Tritons men's 

team was tested, as Roadrunner 
athletes managed to win the 
majority of the events. In order to 
retain the lead, UCSD swimmers 
had to dominate as many of the 
nonfirst-place scoring opponuni-
ties as possible. 

In the 1,000 free, UCSD max-
imized its scoring potential with 
first-, second- and third-place fin-
ishes. Senior Devin Spicer touched 
out freshman teammate Joel 
Tourtellotte by 0.18 seconds, win-
ning the event in nine minutes, 
43 .69 seconds to Tourtellotte 's 
9:43.87. Junior Ben Falcioni 
rounded out TritOn scoring in the 
event with his third-place finish at 
9:54.33, six seconds ahead of the 
first Bakersfield finisher. 

In the 200 free, Boehm defeat-
ed the second- and third-place 
Roadrunner finishers in his 
NCAA "A" qualifying time of 

1 :40.94, edging his closest compe-
tition by 0.69 seconds. Later in 
the meet, Boehm led the charge 
against Cal State Ba1cersfield with 
his victory in the 200 fly in an 
NCAA "A" qualifying time of 
1 :51 .06, followed by junior 
Bernabe Sclafani and sophomore 
Paul Wlkholm who took seccond 
and third, respectively. 

Triton men capitaliud their 
scoring again in the 500 free event. 
TouneUotte outswam the opposi-
tion in a close race that saw the first 
four finishers touch the wall within 
three seconds of one another. 
UCSD swimmers swept the first 
three places, with senior Michael 
Baier and Spicer accounting for sec-
ond and third places, respectively. 

UCSD representatives took 
first through fourth places in the 
200 breaststroke event, again bol-
stering the team's scoring results. 
Sophomore Jacob Dong touched 
out teammates senior Brett Going 

and freshmen Derek Pettit and 
Ryan Kloos, giving the Tritons 16 
points in the event, compared to 
the Roadrunners' three points in 
the event. 

The women's team won its half 
of the meet more handily than the 
men did, winning five of the first 
seven events of the meet, including 
sweeps in the 400 medley relay, the 
1,000 free, the 200 individual med-
ley, and the 200 Hy. 

"I think that we were all pretty 
confident [that we could beat Cal 
State Bakersfield), but we're not 
going to get ahead of ourselves," 
Delurgio said 

Early season confidence will 
connibute to the Tritons' success 
throughout the renillinder of the 
2004-05 season, but the NCAA 
Nationals will not take place until 
March, leaving ample time for 
changes in rankings and for lower-
ranked teams to displace the 
na tionalleaders. 

Go here ·····~·]. 
~~~~ .. / 

"We build off of momentum 
from winning these big meets and 
we'll only get better, Delurgio 
said. "I'm not going to say that 
we're going to win Nationals, but 
we're in the running. November 
rankings don't matter much rela-
tive to the end of the season." 

In the 500 free, Levy took sec-
ond place behind Roadrunner 
jw1ior Loni Burton by 0.75 sec-
onds, but her time of 5:03 .86 was 
fast enough to qualify her for an 
NCAA "A" Nationals. Sophomore 
teammates Marisa Podesto and 
Andrea Lippin followed Levy into 
the wall for third and fourth 
places, respectivly. The result of 
the Triton two-three-four finish 
was that Cal State Bakersfield only 
gained one point on UCSD, nar-
rowly winning the event, 10-9. 

The Tritons return to the pool 
at the Speedo Cup in Long 
Beach, Calif., from Nov. J 8 to 
Nov. 20.

Triton teams are closing in on the 
conference championships, thus 
opening the door for a stronger 
performance at Regionals and later 
at Nationals. 

"I think that we can send four 
people to Nationals this year," 
Tibbs said. 

In the 2003-04 season, Martin 
was the only UCSD fencer to earn 
a berth at the national level after 
claiming one of two wild card 
entries following a dynamic perfor-
mance at the regional event. 

In the Nov. 14 competition, the 
Triton women led the way by con-
trolling each of their matches, 18-
9, prolonging their undefeated sta-
tus. 

While the men's team dismissed 
Cal Tech, 24-3 , it struggled to 
overcome rival Cal State Fullenon. 
Ultimately, the match came down 
to a few individual bouts in which 
the Tritons had to hold their 
ground. 

Epeeist Kevin Watt won a key 
bout against Titan No. 1 dueler 
Otra Olver in an upset that bol-
stered his teams confidence and 
helped the Tritons establish an 
unexpected advantage. 

In the final bout of the match, 
the Tritons and TItans were dead-
locked at 13 as UCSD epeeist 
David Polakoski stepped onto the 
snip. 

(Polakoski) wasn't the anchor," 
Tibbs said. uHe was our first man, 
so we expected him to do pretty 
well ." 

Tibbs' confidence in his team-
mate paid off as Polalcoski earned 
the match, 5 -3, taking the win for 
the Tritons. 

Martin finished the day unde-
fea ted at 6-0. His performance was 
complemented by Tibbs and

nMU;DAY, NOVEMBEIl 18, 2004 1liE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Men's lacrosse continues growth-
Tritons anticipate strong spring season 
., MICHAEL NIUSIIDIIII 

ContributinB --
During the 2002-03 season, the 

men\ lacroae team did not have 
too much to prove. It went into the 
year unrankcd and unknown to the 
world of lacrosse. The team came 
out No. 16 in the nation, with three 
pIayen ranked in the national top 
JOin scoring. 

The team now must prove that 
the last couple of seasons were no 
ftulce and that UCSD can continue 
to be a national powerhouse. Going 
into the 2004-05 season, the team is 
ranIced No. 24 out of 140 teams in 
the United States. The team was 
also ranked No. 24 toward the end 
oflast season after upsetting No. 18 
University of Minnesotll, Duluth. 

Long and difficult workouts in 
the fall have prepared the team for 
the start of the season as it seeks 
revenge in its first game at 
Chapman. The Tritons 2003 season 
ended when the team lost to 
<ppman in the .quane,fina1s by 

, one goal. ' . I .. 
Although the season officially 

begins in February, the team has 
been active throughout the fall. The 
Tritons have been practicing four 
days a week. for close to three hours 
a day. On top of the normal evening 
practices, the players are also 
required to participate in condition-
ing at 7 a.m. 

"It is big-time dedication," head 
coach Albert Man said. "We never 
have to make cuts because people 

just cut themselves." 
The tam also played in two pre-

5eaIOD tournaments to pin some 
game aperieoce. Its schedule is one 
of the most diflicult in the nabOl1, 
and with 10 .-players, experience 
will be important. The Tritons' first 
tournament was Oct. 16 at UC 
Irvine, where they won two pma 
and lost one. The tournament 
included the top team in California, 
and the Tritons weI'C pleased with 
their performance. 

"After a long summer, we defi· 
nitely looked impressive and 
showed we were not a one-year 
wonder," Man said. 

On Oct. 30, the team played in 
the A. Webb Round Robin 
Tournament, where it faced San 
Diego State and the University of 
San Diego. The Tritons proved 
they were No. 1 in San Diego by 
sweeping both teams and winnin« 

th~ tournament. 
"The fall really got us back into 

shape and ready to compete for a 
di~on title,· Man said. , 

The team will now rest up for 
the season and only hold morning 
conditioning. Once the season 
begins, there will be no time for 

. breaks. The Tritons will play the 
. defending division champion, UC 
Santa Barbara, on Feb. 20 and then 
travel to UCLA on Feb. 26. UCSD 
6rst gained national attention last 
season when 'it beat UCLA, 12-7. 

After playing the University of 
Arizona and the University of 

. Southern California at home, the 

Tritons: Martin goes 6-0

coruinutd from pa"e '4 
Runyan on the mens side, both 
ending the day 5-1. 

"Right now, (Martin), 
[Runyan) and I have the highest 
first-place potential," Tibbs said. 
"I'm one bout behind first place 
in the IFCSC.l'm dominating the 
conference. " 

The fencing season, which 
eztends through the March 20 
NCAA Championship, is still 
young, and the athleteS have • 

long way between where they 
stand now and Nationals, but 
their optimism is encouraging. 

"I think that we have the 
strength and unity as a team to 
send a lot of people to Nationals 
and to take this conference by 
storm, " Tibbs said. 

The Tritons return to the floor 
for ·the UCSD Open on Nov. 21 
at RIMAC Arena.

team will make its big trip to Texas, 
where the Thtons will face Texas 
.\AM and University of Texas at 
Austin. 

"Both rX the teams prove they 
are the best in the nation every 
)'UI',. Mao said. "This will be our 
chance to prove that we deserve that 
same reputation." 

Four key returnees will lead the 
Tritons. Jw1ior attaclanan Nick 
Dean was a second-team All· 
American last season and has been 
an offensive force since his arrival at 
UCSD. He was ranked in the top 
lOin scoring each of the last two 
seasons. 

"He will be one of the best play-
ers in the Western Collegiate 
Lacrosse League this year and is a 
key player for success," Man said. 

Last season Dean got attention 
for his performance during the 
UCSD 10-6 win over No. 8 
Arizona, in which he had two goals 
and four assists. 

Junior Morgan Silidorff was also 
an All-American last season. Jw1ior 
Brandon Hayes was an all-league 
selection and will lead the Triton 
defense. Senior Phil Smith promis-
es to be one of the top players in the 
WCLL this season. 

The team has already g-.ined the 
attention of UCSD students. Over 
300 spectators turned out for some 
home games last season. The 
Tritons will try to capture the atten-
tion of the lacrosse nation when 
they begin their season on Feb. 12 
at Chapman.

COIUinued from paie ,6 
junior varsity division, since Division 
I schools assume all varsity positions 
in the regatta. However, racing in 
the jw1ior varsity spot gave the 
women's team a better chance to see 
how it will rank next spring. Because 
NCAA placement is determined by 
overall finishes by region and 
because most spring races are against 
Division I schools that will not be 
considered in the final ranking, the 
Head of the LaIce competition was 
important to determine initial rank-
ings. The UCSD women were able 
to dominate rival scbooIs, such as 
WestI!l1l Wabington University and 
finished the course with a time of 
18:28, compared to Western 
Washington's 18:49. Such domi-
nance early in the year bodes well for 
future NCAA rankings in the spring. 

The Head of the Lake Race was 
especially important to graduating 
seniors Joyce Chang, Liz Record, 
Sara Smolley and Ann ROOy, 
because it was their last faU race. 
Kilduff gave credit to Arlanna 
Pilrim, the boat's coxswain, for the 
team\ outstanding perfottnance on 
Sunday. 

-Arianna k job is to mcxiftte us -
and she did • rood job," Killduff 
aid. "When the Wlter got choppy or 
when rhinp got • little -hud, 
Arianna would tell us to keep going, 
_ saying • few times, 'Okay, this 
strob is for the seniors.' It was a 
good race - we did what we set out 
to do." 

The womens "B" boat partici-
pated in the Fall Oassic, finishing 
sixth in the collegiate open eight 
with a time of 24:03, compared to 
first-place finisher San Diego State, 
which had a time of 22:55. 

The UCSD men's and womens 
crew teams will return to action on 
Mission Bay in February 2005, 
when they race UC Irvine.

Men's and women's fencing 
anticipate 2005 IFCSt titles 

Victory over Cal State Fullerton sets the 
stage for success through spring season 

By MAnHEW GRANT

A fter three successful tour-naments thus far in the 2004-05 season, the 
UCSD·'men's and women's fenc-
ing teams are on pace to take top 
honors in the Intercollegiate 
Fencing Conference of Southern 

Championships. There, the 
women's team earned second-
place awards, while the men fin-
ished in third, both out of a five-
team field .

Tritons take control 
at Serum ~by the .Sea 

Ruggers upset rival Chico 
State in 25-5 route 

By NA1'ALIE .011ON 
Stiff Writer 

The two-day rugby tourna-
ment at the seventh-annual Serum 
by the Sea on Nov. 13 and Nov. 14 
was no place for the faint of heart. 
The Triton women's rugby team 
dominated the competition at 
Warren Field, beating UC Davis, 
UC Santa Cruz, San Jose State 
and UC Berkeley, four highJy 
rated teams, by large margins. 
The Tri tons then went on to 
defeat rival Chico State in ·the: 
event that showcased last year's 
best two teams on the West Coast. 

On Nov. 13, the women rucked 
hard against nationally ranked UC 
Davis, achieving a smooth 49-0 vic-
tory. The second team they tram-
pled (literally), attaining a 38-0 
score, was UC Santa Cruz. SanJose 
State, perhaps a bit intimidated, 
forfeited in the preliminary rounds. 

In the semifinals match on 
Nov. 14, the Tritons beat UC 
Berkeley, 27-0. Even Chico State, 
a long-time adversary that edged 
out the Tritons last year at 
Nationals, couldn't resist UCSD's 
onslaught and lost, 25-5 . This is 
the fourth-consecutive year that 
the Division I team has won the 
event. 

The women were thrilled after 
beating Chico State, using skillful 
manipulation to attain their tries 

and kicks. 
-We came out hard and 

stepped up to show California 
where we stand," senior outs.ide 
center Jessica Venturi said. "The 
forwards played awesome. And 
our rookies definitely inspired us 
this morning." 

Senior Jenny lhplett, playing 
as hooker and flanker for the team, 
attributed the strong performance 
to teamwork. 

"We played together all week-
end and we're a lot more confident 
·OUftMre __ Imow-lWw 'ro reM. 
each other and pull together. We 
know our game," she said. 

This strong sense of unity 
comes from the team's experience 

togeth~r - 12 of the 35 women 
are seruors. 

Regarding their impressive 
game apinst their state rivals, 
Triplett added, "Beating this team 
meant a lot to us, especially after 
losing to them in March." 

Scorers included Venturi, 
Triplett, junior inside center 
Morea Blue and senior outside 
center liki Hays. 

"I'm not going to say it doesn't 
hurt, but it's fun - it's so much 
fun," Hays said. 

This is the last game of the 
quarter for the lady ruckers, but 
they'll be ready to rock again on 
Jan. 22, when they will play 
Clairemont College at UCSD.

Crew teams conclude fall on high note 
Men's tealll takes first at San Diego Fall Classic 

By MAnHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

For the first time in team histo-
ry, the UCSD men's and women's 
swim and dive teams defeated Cal 
State Bakersfield on Nov. 13 at 
Canyonview Pool. The men's team 
edged the defending national 
champions, 130-107, despite gar-
nering first-place finishes in only 
six of the 13 events. The women's 
team established a more comfort-
able lead on the Roadrunners, who 
placed fourth in the 2003-04 sea-
son, 164-77, and won eight events. 
Five Tritons turned in NCAA "A" 
qualifying times in four events, 
including senior Kurt Boehm in the 
200-yard freestyle and 200-yard 
butterfly events, junior Sophie 
Levy in the 500 free, and the 
women's 400 free relay made up of 
sophomore Monica Becles, sopho-
more Emily Harlan, Levy and 
senior Rosanna Delurgio. 

"It was a pretty awesome meet," 
Delurgio said. "I thinlc that [beating 
Cal State Bakersfield] is a pretty 
good predictor of how this team is 
going to do later in the season."

While the fall season for colle-
giate crew may be less competitive 
than the spring season, the UCSD 
men's and women's crew teams did-
n't let that interfere with their final 
performances of the fall. UCSD 
men dominated at the San Diego 
Fall Classic on Nov. 14, finishing in 
first place in the open eight race. 
Women's varsity ranked fifth in the 
Head of the Lake Race, hosted by 
the University of Washington in 
Seattle, the best finish of any non-
Division I school. 

The men's team came into the 
Fall Classic after a competition-
filled month, including the Head 
of the Charles Race in Boston, the 
Row for the Cure event on 
Mission Bay, and the Newport 
Autumn Rowing Festival in 
Newport, Calif. The Fall Qusic 
was the Tritons' final race of the 
fall season. Unlike most sports, 
crew is divided into two seasons. 
Fall consists of head races, in 
which every course is a different 
length and the start is staggered. 
Comparativdy, spring is the more 
competitive season, as schools 
race head-to-head in standard 
2,000-meter events, which are 
used for determining the final 
NCAA rankings. 

The men's team entered the 
FaJl Classic with the goal of beat-
ing University of San Diego and 
San Diego State, which it did easi-
ly. The Tritons' "A" tum, with
