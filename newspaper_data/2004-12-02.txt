Dynes trailing other presidents in pay 
Use of private funds ~ concern, contract lawyer says 

By MARGtlO GONZALES 
Staff Writer 

Although average pay for 
president of public univer ities 
across the nation went up i:Jst 
year, UC President Robert C. 
Dynes' ba e alary has not 
increased since his term began in 
2003 , according to an annual 
report released by the Cbronicle of 
Higbc7' EdllCfltiol1. 

With a base salary of $395,000, 
Dynes' pay is below that of presi-
dent at the 20 t~p-paying public 
institutions. in addition to his 
salary, pynes receives state fund-
ing for housing and maintenance 
expenses totaling $28,666, accord-
ing to UC Office of the President 
spokesman Noel Van Nyhuis. . 

"The president is concerned 

about market-based compensation 
lags throughout the university, 
including for faculty and staff, 
which is one of the things we're 
trying to address through the 
compact [with Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger] and the 2005-06 
budget," Van Nyhuis said. 

The number of presidents 
receiving more than $500,000 in 
annual pay grew from 12 in 2003 
to 17 this year, according to the 
Chronicle, due to. the "increasing 
competition for leaders with 
proven executive experience, 
board members from the busi-
nesS ' world and the use of pay 
supplements from private 
sources· ... 

Unlike last year, S 19,700 of 
Dynes' total compensation pay

Senior Staff Writer 

In a Nov. 30 campus panel 
discussion, three journalism 
experts offered various criticisms 
of wartime coverage in Iraq, 
focusing on issues of media bias, 
inadequate investigation by jour-
nalists of the Bush administra-
tion's argument for war and the 
decline in perceived status of the 
press. 

Robert Kittle, editorial page 
editor of the Stm Ditgo lAtitm-
Tri_t, opened the dialogue by 
examining ·partiality in the 
reporting of wartime news. 
Kittle said the process of embed-
ding war correspondents in mili-
tary units and quartering them 
with soldiers made coveraae 
more favorable toward the con-
flict. While ICknOWIed,m, the 

potential problem, Kittle said he 
also believed that human nature 
made some degree of bias 
inevitable as a result of the close 
working relationshil5 between 
reporters and their sources, 
reprdJess of the story's subject. 

"The question is, does this 
embedding process compromise 
the essential independence of 
regorters, and I think it does, it 
certainly does," Kittle said. 
"Does the embeddinf system 
give you a full picture 0 the war? 
Of course not. And no news 
organization would rely or 
should rely exclusively on their 
embedded reporters because 
they are only getting a tiny 
glimpse of battle. " 

Kittle also charged that jour-
nalists failed in their duty to ver-

S.IaAQ,P"3 

funds provided by nonprofit 
foundations that raise money for 
the university, according to 
Raymond Cotton, a lawyer who 
specializes in university presi-
dents' contracts. This supple-
mented pay is a growing concern 
among university administrators 
across the nation because of the 
undue influence these private 
foundations may have on the 
presidents' decisions, Cotton said. 

"If these private foundations 
are paying the majority of the 
president's salary and compensa-
tion, of course there will be the 
ques'tion of who the president will 
be loyal to," Cotton said.

Staff Writer 

The UC Office of the 
President has selected members 
for a new committee to advise 
the university on the design and 
construction of University 
House, the official residence of 
the UCSD chancellor. 
Recruiting an architect for the 
project will be the committee's 
first task, according to Vice 
Chancellor of External 
Relations James M. Langley. 

The University House 
Building Advisory Committee, 
called together by UC Senior 
Vice PresidentJ~ph P. Mullinix, 
consists of representatives from 
faculty, staff, students and VCOP. 
The 14-member committee 
ensures representation from all 
aspects of the campus communi-
ty, according to Langley. 

"The BAC will make a rec-
ommendation to UCOP as to 
how \lniversity House should 
be built," said Eric Frechette, a 
GSA representative on the com-
mittee. "The. committee is try-
ing to make sure that the $7 or 
8 million it will cost to build 
University House is spent well." 

UCOP chose committee 
members based on their familiar-
ity with University House. Most 
of the members served on a pre-
vious conunittee that evaluated 
the safety of the facility and rec-
ommended that a new house be 
built on the current site.

Study: Republicans rare 
among sodal scientists 

By EDWARD JAHOWIa 
Staff Writer 

The ranks of university profes-
sors teaching in social sciences and 
humanities are dominated by 
Democrats, according to a new 
survey by Santa Clara University 
associate economics professor 
Daniel Klein. 

Klein surveyed aca~emics in 
anthropology, economics, history, 
philosophy, political science and 
sociology, asking them about the 
predelminant political affiliation of 
candidates they have supponed at 
the polls over the last decade. 

An independent survey con-
troller mailed out 5,486 surveys, 
and 1,686 were completed and 
returned. The results of the survey 
indicated uneven ratios of 
Democrats to Republicans in every 
one of the six fields. Overall, the 
social sciences and humanities 

posted a ratio of 7-to-l in f.wor of 
the Democratic party, according to 
the study. The most lopsided fiel d 
was anthropology, with Democrats 
leading by a ratio of 30-to-l . 
Economics and politica l SClcnce 
made up the mOSt balanced field s. 
with Democrat-to- Republ ican 
ratios of 3-to-1 and 7- to-l , respec-
tively. The study also reported that, 
in universities dominated by one 
political party, minority voices 'said 
they often felt "muffled and fear-
ful. " 

"Dr. Klem's sUldy has d ~'awn 
well-deserved attention to the lack 
of intellectual and political diversi-
ty in academia, a problem thar 
urgently needs addressing." said 
Sara Dogan, the national coord i-
nating director of Student for 
Academic Freedom, a national 
coalition of student organizations

I BRIEFLY 
Court blocks release of 
results in mayoral race 

An order from the Califomia Court of Appeals 
has blocked San Diego County's Registrar of 
Voters from certifying the'final results in the city's 
highly contested mayoral race. 

Thou~ the registrar announced official elec-
tion results on Nov. 30, a Santa Barbara-based 
division of the Fourth Appellate District Court 
granted a preliminary stay in a lawsuit challeng-
ing the outcome of the mayoral race eariier In 
the day, preventing the release of the winner. 

The order came in response to a lawsuit 
filed by supporters of San Diego County 
Supervisor Ron Roberts, who trails current 
Mayor Dick Murphy by approximately 16,000 
votes in the race: Both men ran as Republicans. 

The suit all~es that City Councilwoman 
Donna Frye's wnte·in campaign violated the 
city charter, which does not allow for write-in 
candidates in mayoral runoffs. 

The,.final vote count put Frye approximately 
2,000 votes behind Murphy. 

Also on Nov. 30, a separate federal court 
refused to stay 'the election results after hearing 
similar arguments. 

The Santa Barbara courts received the case 
after the entire San Diego bench recused itself 
from adjudicating the matter. A Dec. 3 hearing 
to . conSider the merits of the suit has been 
scheduled. 

Police nab child porn 
suspect near Price Center 

San Diego Police arrested a man charged 
with 29 felony crimes for distribution of child 
pomography after UCSD Police Department 
Officer Manuel Garcia spotted the suspect near 
Library Walk on Dec. I. 

Matthew J. Gan~ a 31-year-old male, has 
been arrested on an outstanding $5,000 bench 
warrant for providing alcohol to a person on 
school grounds and will be held for the previ-
ous felony charges, according to UCSD police 
spokeswom(}ll Kristeen McCollou\!h. 

Campus officers first receivea waming of 
the man through a memo sent out by the city's 
Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force ear-
lier in the week, identifying the man for posting 
child pomography on library computers at 
University of San Diego and San Diego State. 

Earlier on Dec. 1, a female student reported 
that a man matching Ganfs description used 
an apparent camera phone to take pictures 
under stalls' in a women's bathroom near the 
Price Center food court. 

Food workers could not confimn Gant as the 
perpetrator, thou~ his physical description and 
clothing matched'those reported by the student

Government releases draft 
for Los Alamos bids 

The Natiorial Nuclear Security 
Administration has released a preliminary draft 
of its official request to seek competitive bids· 
for the management of the Department of 
Energy laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M. 

The department first decided to solicit man-
agement bids for the lab, and several others cur-
rently run by the University of Califomia, after 
the university drew critidsm over security lapses. 

Under the Request for Proposal, a new 
managing and operating contractor will 'transi-
tion to industrial standards and best practices" 
at the lab and "increase contractor accountabil-
ity and efficiencies,' The draft also requires the 
winner of the contract to keep all current lab 
employees on staff, with the exception of the 
lab's head and other senior personnel. ' 

The temns of the RFP provide for a single 
five-year contract, with provisions for incremen-
tal lS-year renewals as 'an incentive for supe-
rior perfomnance~ 

UC Vice President for Laboratory 
Management S. Robert Foley dedined to com-
ment on the NNSA documen~ stating that the 
university will review the RFP and decide 
whether it will submit a bid for continued man-
agement of the lab. 

'I believe we will be in 'excellent position to 
submit a strong and winning proposal should 
the UC Board of Regents make the final deci-
sion to compete: Foley stated in an official 
release from the university. 

Theater professor appointed 
to diversity officer post 

Chancellor Mar,oe Anne Fox has appointed 
theater professor Jorge Huerta to act as the uni-
versity's new associate chancellor and chief diver-
sity officer. The new position is based on recom-
mendations from the campus' Diversity Council 
and a task force on underrepresented faculty. 

Huerta, who has worked at UCSD for 29 
years and is considered a leading' authority on 
contemporary Chicano and Latino theater, will 
assume his position in January, 

"I am delighted Jorge Huerta has accepted 
the appointment of associate chancellor .and 
chief diversity officer: Fox stated. "He bnngs 
focused and unique perspective on how UCSD 
can expand' its reach locally, nationally and 

intemational~. His appointment to this impor-
tant leadership position reflects UCSD's goal to 
involve all communities in the administration of 
our campus~ .

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting '14 - Dec I, 2004 

Public Input 
President of the San Diego Israel 

Alliance Diane Meskin told the council that 
the Education Abroad Program and the 
Opponunities At>ro.d Progral)'l cancelled 
their studies in Israel in April 2002 after the 
U.S. increased its security threat warning 
for the country. The San Diego Israel 
Alliance is currently in discussions with the 
Programs Abroad Office to create I waiver 
that would allow students to study in coun-
tries that are deemed a security risk after 
waiving university liability. 

John Muir College senior and fonner 
/(1)11111 editor Steve York announced his can-
didacy for the position of A.S. Elections 
Manager. The deadline for applications ini-
tially 9pired on Oct. 21, but was extended 
when no candidates applied for the position. 
York hoped that there would be other appli-
cants in order to ensure efficient elections. 
Applications are available at tmICSII.ucsd.etl#. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
ItemN 

The council allocated $500 to the A.S. 
Midnight Pancake Breakfast, which will take 
place at 11 :59 pm on Dec. 6. The breakfast 
will be open to all srodents and WIll be 
served by campus faculty and administra-
tors. 

Reports 
President Jean Pae 

Pae.reponed that there have been sched-
uling difficulties for the commencement 
ceremonies in 2008. As a result, the univer-
sity and the A.S. Council have been dis-

cussing the postponement of the cer~­
monies. According to Pae, the council has 
submitted a suggestion that the 2008 spring 
break be extended for an additional week. 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
w. Watson said granting the request would 
entail financial hardships for the university, 
but no decision has been made. 

John Muir College Junior Senator Neil 
Spears 

Spears reported that Muir College has 
begun its search for a new provost. The 
provost search committee will conduct a 
campuswide search and then interview can-
didates for the position. Once interviews 
have been completed, the committee will 
name the new provost, hopefully by the end 
of the 2005 winter quarter, Spears said. 

Old B~siness 
ItemH 

The council passed a resolution support-
ing the formation of a chancello,r's commit-
tee on sustainability. The council supported 
initiatives that promote energy conservation 
in order to ensure that there will be ade-
quate energy for future generations. 

New Business 
Item A 

The council plans to discuss and vote on 
amendments to A.S. election bylaws. The 
amendments would add a category of "no 
confidence" to any A.S. electoral race in 

. which there is only one candidate. Any can-
didate running unopposed would hav~ to 
receive more votes than the "no confidence" 
category in order to be elected to the posi-
tion. If this should not occur, the position 
would remain vacant until filled by appoint-
ment.

The ue Office of the 

President. has selected members 
for a new committee to advise the 
university on the design and con-
struction of University House, the 
official residence of the ueSD 
chancellor. Recruiting an architect 
for the p~ject will be the commit-
tee's first task. according to Vice 
Chancellor of Enemal Relations 
james M. Langley. 

The University House Building 
Advisory Committee, called togeth-
er by ue Senior Vice President 
Joseph P. Mullinix, consists of rep-
resentlltives &om &cuIty, StlIff, stU-
denlS and UCOP. The 14-member 
committee ensures representlltion 
&om all aspects of the campus com-
munity, according to Langley. 

"The BAC will make a recom-
mendation to Oeop as to how 
University House should be 
built," said Eric Frechette, a GSA 
representlltive on the committee. ' 
"The committee is tiying to make 
sure that the 57 or 8 million it will 
cost to build University HQuse is 
spent well." 

UCOP chose committee mem-
bers based on th~ &miliarity with 
University House. Most of the 
members served on a previous 
committee that evaluated the safety 
of the ' fucility and recommended 
that a new house be built on the 
current site. 

Members met in November to 
discuss methods of contacting 
architects about the university'S 
intentions . to soIiqt bids; includ-
ing the placement of advertise-
ments in trade magazines. The 
university will notify about 3,000

bers on the committee. 

Given that University House's 
preliminary price ug for construc-
tion is 57.2 million, the committee 
wants to attract architects with 
previous experience in major pro-
jects, Langley said. 

The committee will reconvene 
in January to discuss bids and 
detennine which architects best fit 
the committee's criteria. 

Members will narrow the pool 
to a few candidates who will go 
through an interview process. The 
committee will then recommend a 
finalist to the regents and UCOP 
for a ppoinnnenr, according to 
UCSD's Capital Planning Web site. 

University House BAC mem-
bers will work closely with the 
chosen architect', Tuzin said. They 
want the design of the new house 
to retlin its La Jolla Fanns appear-
~ce but include updated facilities 
that will serve its purpose of entt:r-
uining guests, he said. 

"We want the building to be 
gracious, not ostentlltious," T uzin 
said. "We ~iJ1 examine functional-

ity with design." 
Tuzin said the original house, 

designed ' to accommodate fewer 
'than 1 ()() guests, needs modern 
fearores like a state-of-th~-art 
catering kitchen. 

"I don't want University House 
built quiclcly and poorly - that 
would be a mistake," Frechette said. 
"The house will be used by the 
UCSD chancellor to entertain dis-
tinguished guests and unportant 
donors over the next 50 years. 
University llouse should have a 
timeless design and be built to last." 

Barring any serious setbacks, 
the committee projects the com-
pletion of the new building in 
three years, with the majority of 
that time spent on planning. 
Despite its length, the process 
must abide by the university's 
numerous building' procedures 
because they protect the public's 
interest, according to Tuzin. 

"[f you were building a house 
for yourself, you wouldn't have to 
jump through as many hoops," 
Tuzin said.

Lawmakers put pork 
above Pell Grants 

I n updating- the federal financial aId formula to 
refl ect present-day tax 

data , Congress should have 
also adjusted the maximum 
aid ceil ings to match rising 
tuition rates. 

For the third year in a 
row, feder al legislators 
voted to keep the top Pell 
Grants at $4,050, though 
the award now buys $800 
less than it did 30 years 
ago , after adjusting for 
inflatio n, according to 
Rep. G eorge Miller (D-
C alif.) . By comparison, the 
cos t. of higher education 
ha increased by more than 
20 percent during that 
time, even after accounting 
fo r infl ati on. . . 

It is di singenuous for 
lawmakers to insist on 
modernization when num-
bers reduce the !overn-
Inen t's expected ai contri-
butions - as new tax data 
is expected to do - while 
turnlllg a blind eye to 
swelling college tuition. 

To explain the proposed 
aid regulations, politIcians 
in Congress have cited a 
$3.7 billion deficit in the 
Pell Grant program, which 
ther say the cost savings 
wil help payoff. 

Of course, elected offi-
cials forget: that the shortfall 
has been caused by several 
years of systematic under-
funding that they them-
selves apprqved, thus 
choosing to penalize stu-
dents instead of their pet 
projects to make up for fis-
cally irresponsible policy. As 
a result, 1.2 million students 
will likely see their aid 
reduced , education advo-
cates contend. 

Instead of blaming years 
of debt that was racked up 
during a time when few 
current students could 
even vote, Congress 
should look elsewhere to 
balance the budget and 
restore - if not increase 
- aid to students, who 
need it badly. 

Eliminating'S" spots 
not the only option 

With every passing year, the stead 
migration of "s¥, 

spots to the outskirts of 
campus and the increase of 
"A" and "B" spots in prime 
parking locations becomes 
more apparent. The 
Transportation Policy 
Committee's recent 
approval of a plan to 
replace approximately 300 
"S" r.arking spaces with "A" 
and 'B" spots only makes it 
more difficult for commuter 
students to park even 
remotely close to their class-
es or campus destinations. 

In orcler to alleviate some 
of the strain of the proposal 
o n commuters, 
Transportation and Parking 
Services should take steps to 
make the impact more even-
ly distributed among faculty, 
staff and srudents. Assuming 
that there actuallv is need 
for more "A" and f'B" spots, 
such additions should not be 
done at the expense 'Of "S" 
spots in central parking 

locations. Since the problem 
is not the number of "S" 
spots, but their location, 
adding "A" and "B" spots to 
Nortl1 and East campus lots 
rather than central ca'mpus 
lots would help ease the 
burden on undergraduates. 

One possible avenue that 
the committee should 
explore is limiting parking 
for on-campus residents, a 
strategy many of th~ UC 
campuses already employ. 
This approach would open 
up many of the "s" spots in 
the central campus lots that 
on-campus residents use as 
storage for their cars; com-
munters would much more 
effectively utilize these 
spaces, as residents often 
don't move their cars all 
week. Such a distribution 
would also be more eCJui-
table, as spots would liKely 
go to students with nearby 
classes, and students' vehi-
cles would likely be parked 
only as long as they have 
class.

Fox off to solid start as new ' chancellor ' 
By BIVAN TSAG 

Opinion Editor 

With the quarter drawing to a 
close and students preparing to 
have all the work they've done (or 
not done) over the last 10 weelc.s 
reduced to a simple letter grade, it 
is only fair that they tum around 
and give the same Ic.ind of scrutiny 
to ·the most. promi nent freshman 
joining UCSD this fall : 
Chancellor Marye ·Anne Fox. 
When Fox first joined the univer-
sity, the three most pressing issues 
facing her, were: the budget, 
increasing diversity and improv-
ing school spirit and participa-
tion. It is premature to judge her 
progress on those lofty goals; this 
quaner - with co-op controver-
sies and censorship shenanigans 
- has given students more than 
enough fodder to pore over. 

Fox arrived on campus amid a 
whirlwind of publicity events, 
taking special care to say the right 
thirig and not mffle any feathers. 
Whether it .was calculated politics 
or genuine regard for students' 
well-being, there was no doubt 
that Fox was in charge and ready 
to do business. Fox lead off the 
year by meeting students in per-
son during welcome week and 
later hosted an open -chat with 
students on Sept. 29. Her accessi-
bility - students can even sign up 
for one-on-one time with her 
through her Web site at 
bttp:llwwtv-chll7lu/kr.ucsd.tdu -
has been 'a much-needed change 
of pace after previous C:hancellor 
Roben C. Dynes' relative obscu-
rity. Whether or not that 

increased . accessibility actually 
results in an administration that is 
more responsive to student needs, 
however, remains to be seen. 

During this ' quarter, ' her 
administration has faced two 
major student issues: the status of 
the co-ops and the potential cen-
sorship of Student-Run 
Television. Given the history of 
mistrust between the co-ops and 
the university, it's hard to deter-
mine which side is holdillJ up the 

n~gotiations. Under Fox, the 
administration has done a reason-
able job of communicating its 
issues to the students through let-
ters printed in the GUIl1'dill1l writ-
ten by Assistant Vice C:hancellor 
for Student Life C:armen Vazquez 
and Vice C:hanceUor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson. 

After students v9iced disap-
proval of the UCSD C:losed 
Circuit Television Stations 
Governance C:ommittee, which 
was established to reyiew the gov-. 
erning structures of the campus' 
student television stations and 
potentially increase controls on 
content, the administration again 
responded favorably, adding stu-
dents to the committee. Though 
those decisions likely did not 
come directly from Fox, that her 
administration would at least 
make this Ic.ind of gesture toward 
students reflects positively on her. 
Nonetheless, with the co-ops 
issue yet to be resolved and the 
governance committee yet to 
release any conclusions or guide-
lines, ·it~ hard to say whether 
these attemptS to include students 
Ire genuine or only token moves 

to placate the student body. At 
this point though, the presence of 
these attempts is a definite posi-
tive. Even then, however. her 
administration's efforts have been 
more reactive than proactive. 

Fox's leadership to" date in 
o~er areas has been much more 
direCt, which indicates that she is 
prepared to continue raising 
UC:SD's academic stature. Under 
her watch, UC:SD launched a TV 
studio that will allow UC:SD pro-
fessors and researchers to nlake 
their findings available to the 
public - and,.t little extra con to 
the university. She also ac;ted 
quiclc.ly to appoint Vice 
C:hanceUor of Health Sciences 
Edward W. Holmes to 
C:alifornia's na$Cent [ndependent 
C:itizens Oversight Committee, 
which was created by the recently 
passed Proposition 71. This move 
should ensure that UC:SD will 
have a hand in shaping 
California's stem cell research 
policies. 

Given Fox's background, it 
would be surprising if s~c \\':\5 not 
able to continue UCSD's risc as 
an academic powerhuuse . 
However, her record in dealing 
with the budget cuts has been le~s 
apparent. In just three short 
months; two different labor 
unions of university employees 
have rallied over inadequate cost-
of-living increases in their wage5. 
with the university yet to resolV\: 
either. After saying all the right

Pairings reach a fever pitch in college as we search for life partners Chancellor's 

honeymoon 
winding do\vn indecent exposure 

Marianne Madden 

A few Saturdays ago, I went on an official, bona fide date with my now-
boyfriend. I admit, being in an 
official couple is kind of exciting. 
If my memory serves me correctly, 
our newfound "coupleness" is a 
signal to him that he can drive my 
car and call me "woman"; to me, 
our new status means I can gain 20 
pounds and show symptoms of 
PMS every three days. In any case; 
becoming a couple is sure to doom 
our sex life. 

But I jest (he better not call me 
"woman"). ['m thrilled with the 
new relationship; so thrilled, in 
fact, . that I go right around the 
bend and. become bitter again -
bitter that I have no reason to be 
bitter anymore. 

You must understand: Before, I 
was a near-sighted, left-handed, 
whiny blonde introvett. Now, I'm 
a near-sighted, left-handed, whiny 
blonde introvert with /I boyfrimd. 
See the fundamental difference? 
The difference is that being in a 
stable, affectionate, sickeningly 
fantastic relationship validates 
who I am as a person! Frankly, I'm 
not sure I deserve that. But all I 
can really do ' is banish that 
thought and enjoy yet another 
dinner date or thoughtful gift. 

It's much easier being bitter 
and cynical while you're single, or 
when you're in one of those awful 
relationships we all put up with at 
one point or another. But this rela-

tionship is so goddamn good, its 
threatening to cramp my style. If 
this continues, I'll have to rethink 
my whole personality, my whole 
schtick, my whole existence. 
Already my language, usually pep-
pered with cre-

time to return home and relc.indle 
things with a hometown honey or 
two; for freshmen, 'tis the season 
to dump your hometown 
boyfriend after finally admitting 
that long-distance relationships 

are hellish. And 
atively combined 
swear words, has 
morphed into a 
nauseating array of 
"Oh, how sweet," 
"That was fun!" 
and, the worst of 
all, childish coos of 
"Ooooooooh!" I've 
turned into an 
incoherent idiot, or 
at least the girl I 
normally love to 
hate: 'the girl grin-
ning and wander-
ing slowly across 
campus while hav-
ing nauseatingly 
sweet cell phone 
conversations; the 
girl holding hands 
with her honey 
across the table; 
thc;,girl who actual-
ly takes romance 
advice from 
women's maga-
zines. Hell, I just 
referred to my 
boyfriend as my 
"honey"! Ugh, I 
think .1 just threw 
up a little. . 

Frankly, I blame

we are to admit it, is

up, booty cnlls, fUck 
buddies, friends with 

benefits, and all 
manners of romantic 

and sexual 
dilettantism. Note 
that 'talking on the

for victims of 
romance like me, 
Thanksgiving is a 
ponderous exile 
from a college 
boyfriend or girl-
friend woos gone 
home to another 
region. 

To elaborate 
on the second-to-
last point: fresh-
men, I hope that 
you've realized by 
now that the car-
dinal rule when it 
comes to long-
distance relation-
ships is Don't. 
Just don't. 
C:oDege, as loathe

it, is a time for 
hoolc.ing up, 
booty calls, fuck 
buddies, friends 
with benefits, and 
all manners of 
romantic and sex-
ual dilettantism. 
Note that "talk-
ing on the phone 
with someone 

it on the time of year. In recent 
years, Halloween has emerged as 
the Ic.ick-off to a season full of 
mushiness that doesn't abate until, 
ironically, Valentine's Day. The 
Thanlc.sgiving break, especially, 
has a special place in the hearts of 
many college students. It's the 

who lives 500 
miles away and is probably cheat-
ing on you" is not included in that 
list. So, me it from someone who 
acknowledged two weelc.s into 
freshman year that long-distance 
relationships are about as fun as 
injecting yourself with turpentine: 
Just give it up and start partalc.ing 

in the sweet fruits that your class-
es, your dorms, and your social 
groups and clubs have to offer. 

But beyond the recreational, 
amorphous couplings, college 
represents Do-or-Die when it 
comes to finding a serious rela-
tionship. Said my 28-year-old 
cousin upon hearing news of my 
new boyfriend: "!-Jang onto him. 
If you don't find someone in col-
lege, you're doomed for life." 
Details of my cousin's own biogra-
phy seem to beat this out. He 
squandered his college years mak-
ing funny parodies of Mentos 
commercials, and now he's going 
on torturous dates with women he 
meets over craigslist. (In other 
news, if anyone is from the 
Portland, are., area and likes shy, 
28-year-old movie buffs, I have 
just the man for you.) . 

At the other end of the spec-
trum are people like the Stanford 
student I met over the summer. 
She was fond of jolc.ing (well, at 
least I hope she was jolc.ing) that 
she's attending Stanford not for a 
B.A. or B.S., but for an M.R.S. 
Ouch' .. . but hey, if she wants a 
pretentiouS husband with a Ic.iller 
trust fund, she's struck a gold-
mine. 

So, as finals make you want (0 
crawl into a hole and winter break 
seems like a cruelly distant fantasy, 
just think: Love - or at least lust 
- could be just around the comer. 
And if it isn't, you're perfectly wel-
come to complain all you want. 
Just don't bother me - I have a 
phone call to take, and I have a 
feeling it'll be a long and mushy 
one.

Fox has also thus far fail ed to

ning of the year. Theater professor 
Jorge Huerta's Nov. 30 appoint-

Dynes' 1997 IO-point action plan). 
Fox must back Huerta up with

All in all, Fox hasn't made any

generosity in such a manner.

More infonnation about class TAs should 
be available to students before classes begin 

By KELLY GILBERT 
Staff Writer 

One of the huge marketing 
strategies private schools employ is 
the professor-to-student ratio. "No 
classes taught by teaching assis-
tants!" they brag. The boast makes 
the erroneous assumption that all 
TAs are equally skilled in instruc-
tion, and classes taught entirely by 
professors are preferable. That's 
pretty debatable, though, and with 
UCSD ranked as the 24th-best 
university in the world by Tbt 
British Tmrts, TA-Ied classes clearly 
have the potential to be the back-
bone of a pretty decent education. 

To make that actually happen, 
however, UCSD has a lot of work 
to do. Teaching assistants' instruc-
tion should be more standardized; 
furthermore, TAs, like professors, 
should be evaluated, and students 
should be allowed access to such 
data so that they can make 
informed choices as to whose class 
they want to take. . 

What actually happens to the 
feedback that students give to TAs 
on their Course and Professor 
Evaluations? Not enough. Section 
instructor information should be 
put on WebReg along with pro-
fessor information, so students 
can really make informed choices 
about section registration. Even if 
C.A.P.E.'s TA evaluations are 
documented, they're relatively 
useless if students have no access 
to the results. They should be able 
to know which TAs will be leading 
which sections - essentially, who 
will be assigning their grades. 

Of course, this procedure 
varies. In Bll..D 10, for example, a 
lower-division biology class for 
nonmajors, sections are wholly 
optional. Afrer learning which TAs 

teach various sections, and when 
these sections are held, smdents 
can choose which, if any, to anend 
and how often. If they like more 
than one TA, they can attend more 
than one section. If they prefer to 
study solo, that's an option too, and 
with no penalty to their grades. 

In classes where sections are 
mandatory, however, TAs are 
more often than not the ones 

~, 
[TJwo students enrolled in 
the same course could in 

reality be taking ttoo 
entirely 

different classes. " 
grading student work. 

In literature or history classes, 
for example, which are general 
requirements for 'many students, 
most c1a5S'T'ork is graded by several 
different TAs. While all class sec-
tions have the same material to 
cover and the same prompts for 
papers, different TAs can have 
markedly different standards, not to 
mention grading systems. One TA, 
for example, might take attendance 
each weelc, while another might 
think a few weeks' worth would suf-
fice. And with topics as open-ended 
and subjective as most essay quesc 
tions, each TA will have a different 
perspective and a different standard 
for assigments and grades. 

Therefore, two students 
enrolled in the same course could 
in reality be taking two entirely 
different classes. Thus, it's vital for 
students to have all of the infor-

mation about a class' instructors. 
The John Muir College Writing 

Program, a two-quarter require-
ment for all Muir students, is a 
good example of a class that pro-
vides ample information. In Muir 
Writing, classes are taught entirely 
by TAs - they set the program, 
choose texts and make assignments. 
Professors are enti rei y removed 
from the classes. On WebReg, TAs 
aren't credited as teachers; the 
"professor" segment is just listed as 
"department chair," which is hardly 
sufficient information. Muir 
Writing remedies this, however, by 
providing students a complete list 
of topics, TAs and other salient 
information, available in the pro-
gram office and usually online. 

If all classes offered the same 
information, students would find 
less need to switch classes mid-
quarter. As the process stands 
now, students who find themselves 
in a section with a TA they do not 
like can sometimes. switch 
between sections, but this is usual-
ly difficult to do when a student 
has already planned out his or her 
entire schedule without room for 
overlaps. Information about all 
the instructors for a class, includ-
ing who the TAs are, should be 
available during the registration 
process to avoid this problem 
altogether. 

n the extremely unlikely 
chance that section registration 
drops significandy because stu-
dents don't want to deal with a 
specific TA, then maybe it would 
be time to start training TAs more 
effectively. Or, at the very least, 
attempt to standardize instruction 
across the board. 

Then, having "many classes 
taught by TAs" wouldn't be a bad 
thing . .

More students added to closed<ircuit board 
Watson extends deadline for broadcast recornrilendations 

By AMY IFUIUNG 
Staff Writer 

Following complaints over a 
lack of student representation, 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson has added rep-
resentatives from each of the six 
colleges to a committee designed 
to discuss policies for campus 
closed-circuit television stations. 
The original plan for the commit-
tee, drafted by Watson, allowed 
for only one student representa-
tive. 

"It was my assumption that 
there would have been collabora-
tion berween students anyway, but 
I'm quite open to having more 
students on the committee," 
Watson said. "Thtre's no reason 
for a lack of a student voice." 

Dissatisfaction with the 
board's proposal was summarized 
in a letter to Watson and com-
mittee chair Nichoias S. Aguilar, 
who also serves as director of 
stud<!nt policies and judicial 
affairs. The letter was written by 
A.S. President Jenn Pae, SRTV 
station manager Chelsea Welch 
and Revelle College sophomore 
SCOtt Steahl. 

"In order for the committee to 
accurately distinguish the nature 
of the television stations and work 
more efficiently, it would 1>e vital 
to have sufficient collegiate stu-
dent representation," the letter 
stated. 

Initially, the committee con-
sisted of five administtators and 
Welch, a Revelle senior, was the 
sole student member. 

The board was created in 
response to conflicts of policy 
among campus-run' media in the 
2003-04 school year, including the 
controversial airing of the behead-

ing of American Nicholas Berg in 
Iraq by Earl Warren 90Uegc tele-
vision. 

"We had last year i number of 
issues about content and whose 
responsibility it is," Watson said. 
"[fhis committee) is a way of clar-
ifying that problem." 

As oudined by a letter from 
Watson to A.S. Vice President 
Internal Cat YQPYUco, objectives 
for the committee include deliber-

" .. , I'm quite qJen to 
haUng more students on 

the rommittee. There's no 
rea.ul far a lack of a 

student IDee. 
- Joseph w. WItson. vice 

chIIaIor 01 sIudent .. 

ation and agreement on "how and 
to what degree the [station's) 
sponsoring entity has responsibili-
ty" and "the purpose and nature of 
the station's programming and the 
guidelines governing content." 
. The committee is in no way a 

governing unit of student-run 
media, and holds only the power 
to review and discuss policy, 
Watson said. . 

However, student representa-
tives still expressed fears over the 
undue control of content by the 
board. . ' 

"After these first few meetings, 
it's still hazy about whether the 
committee is simply there to dis-
cuss and recommend or to serve as 
an actual oversight," Welch said . . 

Progress in the committee's 
deliberations has been slow, with 
much time spent on defining the 
nature of each station. 

Also under scrutiny is the 
charge of the committee, specifi-
cally the definition of. the term 
"sponsoring entity" in Watson's 
written charter. Committee mem-
bers have expressed disagreement 
over whether the term implies an 
authoritative unit or simply an 
entity that provides funding. 

In addition to Eailin, to agree 
on the interpretation 0 the com-
mittee's charter, student members 
expressed concerns over potential 
limitations of content. 

"Each station is unique in its 
own way. We have six colleges, six 
stations and SRTV - all of them 
different," said John Muir College 
senior Kimberly Robbins, a mem-
ber of Muir TV and the Muir rep-
resentative on the committee. 
"Who are we to decide what can 
and cannot be shown?" 

The committee expects to pro-
duce a report of its recommenda-
tions for Watson by Feb. 2, a 
deadline the vice chancellor 
extended from the original date of 
Nov. 10. Aguilai' attributed the • 
delay to the inclusion of more stu-
dent representatives and holiday 
constraints. 

"By the time we were able to 
get more student representatives, 
it was pretty close (Q the 
November deadline, and the time. 
has been extended in recognition 
of the fact that we're pretty close 
to finals and students will be leav-
ing in December - we need this 
in order to get the most student 
involvement," Aguilar said.

Bias: Democratic presence 
highest in anthropology 

continued from ~ I 
with the goal of ending political 
indoctrination at universities. 

The group is pushing for an 
·"Academic Bill of Rights,': a com-
mon university policy ensuring that 
"no political, ideological or reli-
gious orthodoxy will be imposed 
on professors and researchers 
through the hiring or tenure or ter-
mination process." Congress 
passed a nonbinding resolution 
baclcing the bill in the current pro-
posal for the Higher Education 
Renewal Act, an omnibus bill gov-
erning most aspects of the federal 
government's involvement in high-
er education. 

"We do believe the vast dispari-
ty between Democrats and 
Republicans is due primarily to the 
blacklisting of conservative appli-
cants by hiring and tenure commit-
tees," Dogan said. "Our organiza-
tion encourages colleges and uni-
versities to adopt the Academic Bill 
of Rights to guarantee that stu-
dents' academic freedoms will be 
preserved and that partisan politics 
will not playa role in university 
hiring decisions or in the class-
room." 

The relative absence of conser-
vatives in academia not only hin-
ders academic freedom but also 
affects the quality of education 
that students get, according to 
Dogan. 

"Some professors do make 
every effort to have ideological 
diversity, but many do not," said 
Patrick Todd, chair of the UCSD 
College Republicans. "Some pro-
fessors object to being forced to 
present ideologies that they don't 
personally believe in." . 

However, the American 
Association of University 
Professors - an opponent of the 

proposed Academic Bill of Rights 
- has argued that the political 
affiliation of faculty does little to 
prevent academic freedom or lower 
the quality of student education. 

"The views of faculty 
members are far more likely to be 
intluenced by their years of srudy, 
research, writing and teaching in 
their field than by any political 
party line," AAUP Director of 
Publk Policy and Communications 
Ruth Flower said. 

Although the AAUP's mission is 
(Q preserve academic freedom, it 
doesn't believe that the predomi-
nance of Democrats limits this 
freedom as long as faculty members 
are autonomous and self-govern-
ing, according to Flower. 

"I would hope that faculty, 
whatever their political persua-
sions, would teach students, above 
all, how to think critically," UCSD 
sociology professor Rebecca Klatch 
said. "I think most faculty here are 

. interested in this mission, whatever 
their . own political values might 
be." 

According to Klein's stud)" 
Democratic sociology professors 
outnumbered the ir Republi can 
colleagues 28-to-l, making it the 
field with the second most uneven 
ratio. 

"Sociologists are not as diverse, 
politically, as the general public, 
but I don't think tllat means that we 
don't have diverse ' perspectives," 
UCSD sociology professor Amy 
Binder said. "One of the key foun-
dations for being a sociologist is to 
be able to ,collect empirical data 
and to make sense of that 'data , 
whether you agree with the people 
you are investigating or not."

Pay: UCOP concerned with lagging pay 
continued /rom pa,r I 

is his ability to raise money, there is 
a concern that presidents may 
become too focused on "selling" an 
education to donors rather than 
seeing the university as a research-
oased institution for exchanging 
ideas , American Association of 
University Professors Director of 
Research John Curtis said. 

"All are sti ll nonprofit organiza-
tions wim a research mission, but ... 
they tend to focus on mat revenue-
generating perspective." Curtis said. 
"They end up operating more like 
corporations. and the high level of 
pay is furthering mat trend ." 

Dynes ranks 30th out of the 131 
university presidents surveyed. 
receiving 5423 ,666 in total com-
pensation, a drop . from the 
$5 18,792 he received last year. 

However, the Chrtmiclt's report 
on the president's pay "is a lime 
misleading," according to Van 
N yhuis. T he drop in Dyne's pay 
reflects the publication 's failure to 
include administrative funds -
such as events at the president's 
house that are covered by the uni-
versity - in the total compensa-
tion as it did in me past, Van 
Nyhuis said . However, he said 

Dynes' pay was still lower than 
that of his colleagues at other 'pub-
lic universities. 

"His compensation is relatively 
low compared to most large public 
instirutions anq certainly low com-

pared to most large private 
schools," · Van Nyhuis said. "The 
regents set the president's salary at 
me level they believe appropriate 
to draw the most qualified candi-
dates." 
. Despite flat pay for Dynes, deci-
sions by the university to offer sig-
nificant pay' increases to incoming 
chancellors at several UC campus-
es in me last several years have 
stirred controversy, drawing criti-

cism from the union ;epresenting 
the universi ty's staff. 

Even as some administrative 
wages have gone up, pay for faculty 
and staff remains stagnant, said 
Denise Carignan, vice president of 
UCSD's Loal 5 of the Coalition of 
University Employees. 

"I think mat's great mat his 
salary is not increasing," Carignan 
said. "It's important for these peo-
ple in these high positions, know-
ing that the university has been 
having budget problems for the 
past two years. to understand thal if 
mey're not raising our pay, they 
shouldn 't be getting more money 
either." . 

Considering the quali ty of edu-
cation in the UC system compared 
to other universities that pay thei r 
presidents more than $500,000 
annually, the UC president is 
underpaid, Cotton said. 

"The University of Caljfornia is 
honestly one of the best in the 
nation," C otton said. "I think that 
the UC president ought to be paid 
at least $ 500,000, across the 
board."

Talk: Dean 
blames media 

decline on 
profit focus 

continued from page 3 
m'edia in Iraq to that of previous 
armed conflicts, especially the 
Vietnam War. 

"The press · came out of 
Vietnam somewhat battered, but 
very confident .. bout its own per-
formance and its own place in the 
social and cultural firmament in 
this country," Mosettig said. 
"Coming out of Iraq into the first 
decade of this cenrury, I don't thinle 
we can say we are confident about 
either of those things." 

Orville Schell, dean of UC 
Berkeley's Graduate School of 
Journalism, said he was displeased 
with the media's presentation of the 
events leading up to the war, and-
criticizes me commercial interests 
of news networks. 

"There were simply almost no 
major media outlets doing what I 
think they ought to have done by 
way of being watchdogs and skep-
tics." Schell said. "Prewar coverage 
was bad. especially on television; 
because it was not as profitable as 
'The Apprentice.' It was difficult 
for a big network to have a debate 
because they couldn't find one hour 

" There is ... a lack of induL-
gence far embracing the 

media as a u.tltthdog ... "

BeIbIIy GrId ..... School of 
JownaIlsm 

at any time of day to have it." 
The panel also discussed possi-

ble reasons for an increasingly unfa-
vorable attitude toward .the press. 

"There is not only a lack of 
indulgence for embracing the media 
as a watcndog, but we find people 
demeaning it, tarring it as 'liberal,' 
'troublemakers' or 'unpatriotic,' 
which makes it very difficult for 
Uoumalists) to do what they really 
ought to lit doing," Schell said. 

Schell said he felt the Bush 
administration exemplified the prac-
tice. citing what he sees as its com-
bative relationship with the media. 

"There is not only a disrespect 
for the role of the media, but also 
a reincarnated view of where the 
truth, knowledge and understand-
ing come from. There is this feel-
ing amongst ~ny people in the 
media of this administration's 
[idea) of revealed truth, not empir-
ical truth - not truth born from 
discussion, reRarch, knowledge or 
empirical evidence ... but just in a 
room IS a kind of revelation, ft • 
Schell said. "The people who ask 
questions are seen as troublemak-
ers, and that they can't pOSsibly be 
patriotic if they are impeding the 
process of the government doing 
its revealed work. That is a very 
dangerous turn of events." 
. During a question-and-answer 
period, audience member Sandra 
Dijkstrl criticized the media, 
including the panel members, for 

. continuing to report poorly on 
ongoing developments in Iraq. 

"The press sold this war and now 
they are selling it again. We have 
just destroyed Fallujah ... where is 
the press?" Dijkstra asked. "It~ not 
about looking back to the run-up to 
the war, it~ about looking back to 
the continued destruction of Iraq 
and me plllll\ed invasion of Iran." 

The program was moderated by 
Miles Kahler, the director of 
UCSD's Instirute for International, 
Comparative and Area studies, 
which sponsored the ~t.

• b e 

efore we've even finished our 
leftover turkey, we're quickly ush-
ered into the holidays and· all 

their merriment and entertainment. With finals 
looming, it's hard to imagine the average UCSD . 
student really thinking about anything but exams 
and papers for the next .week or so. But start 
thinking ahead, for the holiday film season fea-
tures movies for everyone -
even the grinches among us. 
From a love story set in 
World War I, to the quirky 
world of Count Olaf, the 
musical mastery of Andrew 
Lloyd Webber, an unfortu-
nate meeting with the in-
laws and a multimillion-dol-
lar heist, there's much to 
choose from this season. 
Here are a few of Hiatus' 
pickings to whet your 
appetite. 

CLOSER 

M an loves woman. Man gets tire.d of woman and loves another woman. Woman seduces other woman's man. 
Complicated? If It's lo'/e, It's Qot to be compli-
cated. Such is the basis of "Closer," Academy 
Award-winninQ director Mike Nichols' newest , 
film. Jude Law, ' Clive Owen, ' Natalie Portman 
and Julia Roberts collaborate as the quartet In 
this holiday season's triangle d'amour drama. 

If you're In the mo'od for a little bit of dia-
logue, a little bit of heartache, a lot of sex, a 
lot of very appealin!) British men and a lot of 
Natalie Portman pole-dancin!), then this will 
be the definite movie to see. Ultimately 
though, the film Is about the fascinations of 
first loves, second loves, love at first sl!)ht 
and the heartbreaklnQ consequences of 
fallln!) out of love.

steemed Spanish director Pedro Almad6var returns E this winter with his latest creation "Bad Education." Starrlnq Gael Garda Bernal ("Motorcycle Diaries," "Y

a series of unfortunate events. The two' schoolboys. are 
reunited when IQnaclo (Bernal) presents his childhood 
friend, Enrique (Martinez), now a successful director; with a 

script based on their Childhood. The script, a 
loosely autoblOQraphical .account of the abuse 
they both suffered at school, Is soon taken on 
board with Enrique as director. It Is at this point 
that !maQlnation becomes blurred with the 
harsh realities they boys endured. 

Much Oscar buzz Is expected with

LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES 
OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS 

J im Carrey has a penchant lor over.actinQ, and "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events" is an outlet that allows him to ham it up as the overindulgent, manic, villainous thespian Count Olaf. Three 
orphans, Violet (Emily Drowning), Klaus (Llam Aiken) and Sunny (Kara and 
Shelby Hoffman) Baudelaire, are forced to live at the Count's gothic mansion 
after their parfllts die In a fire. Soon, ~ount Olaf attempts various means of 
getting rid of the talented Baudelaire siblings in ord,r to procure their sub-
stantial inheritance. After the Count's first failed attempt, the children Qet 
shuffled through bizarre relatives, like their herpetolOQlst Uncle Monty (Billy 
Connolly) and their anxious, grammar-obsessed Aunt Josephine (Meryl 
Str..". With spooky settings right out of a Charles Dlckens.novel, the fanta-
sy-filled film, based on the best-selling children's books, promises to be a 
dark, hysterical battle between the wicked Count and the gifted children.

THE AVIATOR 

T he Aviator" soars into theaters this season hoping to make a mark at the box olfice, and possibly at the Oscars. With a director like Martin Scorcese behind it, at 
the very least the film should provide some spectacular flight 
seq.uences. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Howard Hughes, the 
eccentric billionaire known for his work as both a HollYWOOd' 
film mogul and an aviation pioneer. Academy Award'winning 
screenwriter John Logan ("Gladiator," " The Last Samurai") 
focuses on Hughes' early Iile and his passion lor lIying, films 
and beautiful women. With a lot of talent and a big budget to 
work with, Scorcese seems more than capable of pulling olf th is 
ambitious biopic. Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec BaldWin 
and Jude Law co-star.

TH E PHANTO M 
OF THE OPERA 

T his winter, "The Phantom of the Opera," one of Broadway's longest running musicals, makes its way from the stage to the silver screen. The film version 
stars Gerard Butler as the Phantom and Emmy Rossum as 
Christine. "The Ph;mtom of the Opera" is the story of a disfig' 
ured man who haunts the passageways under the Paris Opera 
House, often terrorizing the cast and crew. He falls in love with 
the beautiful Christine and becomes her "Angel of Music," guid-
ing her to become a star, but jealousy overtakes him when she 
falls lor the handsome Raoul. 

This movie promises to keep close ties to the well-known 
stage version in terms of the story and the score, while at the 
same time giving it a sense of realism not possible on a stage. 
Purists may find themselves annoyed by the addition of a new 
song, and changes to the score in places where dialogue has 
bHn added. Overall, this seems to be a very well· done produc-
tion ~t should be enthusiastically received by old fans as well 
as those who have never seen the stage version.

. A new life for U.itten Law 
SoCal punk favorites return with 

free UCSD show, new album. 
By CODY NABOUU 

Staff Writer 

Speaking in generalizations. everyone from California has at least one blink,-182 album. If you're up to snuff on the 
pan-California skate-punk scene, the record 
you have is DIUIt Rimeb. (If yours is Enmu of 
tbe Sin" congratulations: You belong to the 
legions of out-of-the-loop MTV-fed 

Mi~westerners.) Among the memorable 
Drult Rncb singles is a little number called 
"Josie," about an admittedly cool girlfriend 
that delivers gifts of Sombrero's Mexican 
food and likes "UL and DRC." Back when I 
was in middle school, only the cool kids 
knew that UL meant Unwritten Law. 

Those in the know had heard of the 
Poway-raised Unwritten Law from the 
sttength of their first !WO albums, 1995's 
Blue RDom and 1996's Oz Ft«tor, both of 
which, like DIUIt R41fCb, consisted of high-
energy Southern California skate-punk 
laden with pop boob and shout-out chorus-
es. Two years later, Unwritten Law came out 
with a self-titled third album, which was 
strong and well polished, containing the hit 
single <at least on the local airwaves) 
"Cailin." In the SoCaI scene, "the black 
album," as we affectionately referred to it, 
was a must-own. 

At this time, Unwritten Law was com-
prised of vocalist Scott Russo, guitarists Rob 
Brewer and Steve Morris. bassist Pat Kim 
(just late of Spl'UAg Monkey) and drummer 
Wade Youman. By 2002, "Seein' Red" was 
on Total Request Live, and its accompany-
ing album, EJVII, brought Unwritten Law 
into the mainstream. Soon after, a quasi- ' 
acoustic album recorded in Yellowstone, 
Wyo., rugged at the heartstrings of the TRL . 
youth. The album did more than just show 
Unwritten Law's. tender side; it highlighted 
the craftsmanship of their songwriting, as 
their older punk rave-ups translated surpris-
ingly well to the high altirudes and acoustic 
guitars. • 

Unwritten Law's next album, Hert 's to the 
Mourning, is set for release in early 2005. 
Like the rest of their catalog, it follows two 
Unwritten Law precedents: the desire and 
ability to r.xlc, and the desire and ability to. 

(£)~PREVI....::..=c...;;.;:.:...:::: 
craft memorable pop boob. Despite the 
album tide, this is no sad-boy emo afl1ir, but 
an energetic, if overproduced, rock album 
that makes good use of the band's tutelap in 

. SoCaI pop-punk. They have IR0ged further 
down the EJv. path, toward a more' main-
stream rock sound, and away &om the faster 
punk of their youth. But who elte besides 
NOFX still plays skate-punk like we 
remember it? 

Pat Kim, the band's bassist, is wary of the 
"SoCaI surflskate scene" label that many old 
fans and critics have pigeonholed them into. 

"Other than Scott, no one really sbtes in 
this band," Kim said. "I skated in high 
school, and I don't surf, so ... 1 think we just 
wrote a really great rock record, you know?" 

Regardless of the rock or punk mediwn, 
Unwritten Law continues to put together 
well-made, enjoyable music, projecting 
energy from their pores and smooth har-
monies fr0!R their throats. At the very least, 
Kim assures that the songs sound great live. 
"Unwritten Law is a live band," he said. 

Unwritten Laws live show will arrive in 
their native San Diego on Friday, Dec. 3, 
when they play a free show in Price Center 
Plaza at 8 p.m., as pan of the Thank God It's 
Over (f.G.I.O.) celebration that leads into 
finals week. It will be a sort of homecoming 
for the group, 'most of Whom still uve in San 
Diego. They recognize the appeal of their 
old music and never forget the tunes of yore, 
even if they have moved in a decidedly 
mainstream rock direction over the last cou-
ple of years. -

Unwritten Law are not a band that will 
change the face of rock music. Unwritten 
Law are a band designated to beachfront-
cruising convertibles filled with tanned, 
beautiful faces. Unwritten Law are a band 
that makes old fans decry the new albums 
while tapping their feet to the new singles 
playing in shopping malls. Unwritten Law 
are a band that you see on a Friday night, 
and have a damn good time doing 'it. 

'5eeln'l COI1IeNdI: Unwritten liIw's show at UCSD on Dec. 3 wID be something of a homecoming 
for the band. Originally from Poway, moSt of the group's members still live in the Sail Diego area.

Pinback 
Summer In Abaddon 

Touch and Go 

***~ Ina word~ . hypnotic. S/mlllu/, III Ab~ddoll, Pinback's third proper 
albul\l, is an orga nic nct-
work of mechanized 
arrangements working in 
lod:-step pr~cision, like n 
kaleidoscupe of sound in 
bullet lime. 

The duo of Rob Crow 
and Armistead Burwell 
Smith I are the core of 
Pin back, hailing from San 
Diego, who perform their 
complex indie-rock with 
an ever-changing cast of 
players during live shows. 

At low volumes, 
SlI7IImer /11 AbaddOIl 
induces alpha waves and, 
ultimately, sleep. Turn it 
up , and the intricacies 
reveal themselves, not 
slowly, but instantaneous-
ly, like taking off the face 

. 

of an expensive, hand-
made watch and viewing 
all the gears within . 

Through headphones, 
the album divides itself 
dynamically, highlighting 
each separate part, be it a 
single electric bass 
thumping, atmospheric 
plano line or one of many 
small, interlocking guitar 
twitches . 

'Everything seems 'to be 
cyclical on the album; 
there 3re voca I choruses 
sung in a round, drums 
that paralyze with their 
seemingly simplistic repe-
tition, and songs that feel 
like you're spinning slow. 
Iy in a room. 

Songs like "The Yellow 
nes," "ender" and 

"Bloods On Fire" are 
indie-pop anthems, pos-
ses ing some of the most 
com pelling musical sec-
tions and nearly sing-
along choruses for indie 
kids. 

By the way, in case 
you're wondering, "abad-
don" is a five-star Bible 
word that refers -to a but-
tomless pit of -ruin and 
destruction. Nice. 

Pinback will perform 
with fellow ' San Diego 
heroes the Album Leaf 
and the AdVantage at the 
Casbah Oil Dec. 5.

To be billed as "indie-folk" might require one to acruall y play 
folk music; this is not so 
with "indie-folk" artist 
Neko Case. The amount of 
folk in her latest album 
equates to the amount of 
real fruit juice in Tang. For 
those curious, it's about 10 
percent - or one in 10 
songs. Case's fourth track 
"Wayfaring Stranger" is 
haunting with intricate 
banjo picking, but it's 
almost the only song on 
her new album, The Tigtrs 
Hllv( Spo/un, that is a tradi-
tional folk song. 

Folk music, to clarify, is 
music for ordinary "folk" 
- with songs passed down 
through oral tradition, 

often with excellent musi-
cianship. There's nothing 
liKe going to a folk/blue-
grass competition to hear 
good Illusicians. Not that 
Case's music is not good, 
it's just not folk - indie or 
not - and it's annoying for 
real folk musicians tfJ hal'c

F1ipt of me Phoenix 
Adrift in an endless sea of 19605 

remakes, "Flight of the Phoenix" 
retells the story of a maverick pilot 
(then Ji~y Stewan, now Dennis 

, , 

Quaid) who crashes a plane full of 
eccentric characters in the middle 
of the desen. With no food or 
water, their only hope for survival 
is to rebuild a smaller plane from 
the wreckage. While bereft of the 
Cold War political climate that . 
made the original such a taut little 
thriller, this film's political bent 
should prove interesting if it does 
not succumb to the hackneyed 
approach taken by 2004's thor-
oughly horrible remake of "The 
Manchurian Candidate." 
Regardless of politics, this film 
should be a visll2l treat, fearunng 
sweeping desen vistas and an irre-
sistible, gleaming 19405 cargo 
plane. Be sure to look out for intc;r-
esting performances from 

. Giovanni Ribisi as a Gennan engi-
neer and Hugh Laurie (of "Jeeves 
and Woostier" fame) as a hysterical 
corporate hack. 

Beyond the Sea 

- Brian U'ip 
StrWr StIIjf Wriur 

. It seems like talented stars of 
today are paying homage to their 
heroes by becoming them. Jamie 
FC?D did it with "Ray," and now 
Kevin Spacey has done it with 
"Beyond the Sea," a biopic of 
Bobby Darin, the famous.poP icon 
he eerily resembles. Darin lived 
with a hean condition that eventu-
ally killed him at the age of 37, but 
that didn't stop him from record-
ing such hits as "Mack the Knife," 
"Splish Splash" and "Beyond the 
Sea." Singing, -dancing and acting 
like the legendary showman is no 
date with a dream lover, but 
Spacey, equipped with a Tony and 
an Oscar, has plenty of perfonning 
talent. for the role. Kate Boswonh 
portrays Darin's wife Sandra Dee, 
the teen idol who the PinK Ladies 
of "Grease" pOKe fun at. John 
(;Qodman and jazz musician Peter 
Cincotti also make appearances in 
the film as Darin's manager an4 
trumpet-playing best friend, 
respectively.

'Tis ·the season· for' 
sensory overload 
Going gaga ' from too 
much holiday spirit 

full 
s t 9 p' 

SarahMak 

As I write this column from Chicago, there is something odd going on outside. I say 
odd because despite the near-bliz-
zard-force snow pelting down 
(OK, maybe that's a bit of an exag-
geration, but it is bloody miser-
able) on the throngs of post-
Thanksgiving shoppers, and the 
fact that the streets are packed with 
a ton of people, everyone is in a 
really, really good mood. I suppose 
it's that thing 'lYe call "holiday spir-
it." That, or the fact that It's one of 
the biggest sale periods of the year 
and shoppers are going crazy. 

Every year, I know it's about 
time to get in the "holiday spirit" 
when Oprah Winfrey has her 
"Favorite Things" episode. This 
is, quite possibly, the one and only 
"Oprah" episode of the year that 
is of any importance. In just 60 
minutes, Oprah. goes through her 
list of favorite stocking stuffers 
and plays Santa to her audience, 
showering them with everything 

" 

the silver screen. Granted, the 
majority of these movies are what 
we call "family movies," but a fam-
ily movie isn't one that ,substitutes 
gentle, family humor for bad plots, 
unfunny scripts and unnecessary 
slapstick. Nevertheless, "Christmas 
with the KraDb" managed to rank 
third in this weekend's box-office 
earnings. Of course, following in 
the true tradition of Christmas 
family movies, be sure to see end-
less repeats of these holiday movies 
on TV for years to come, because 
it's the fact that these movies are 
about Chri~tmas that. guarantees 
them such success. Perhaps if 
Oliver Stone decided to further 
butcher "Alexander'" and dress 
Colin Farrell in tinsel, the film 
would have done a lot better in the 
box offices. In all serjousness 
though, we ought to hold the same 
expectations for our movies during 
the holiday season, l)0l just drop 
those expectations when we get 
into the spirit of things, 

It's not only movie though; 
come Christmas, record srores are 
flooded with "best of' albums. 
There's nothing wrong with a 
"best of" album for the most part, 
unless your name is Rod Stewart 
or you're a band that's been 
around for two years, For a man 
who's well past his sell-by date and 

from Blackberries 
to Burberry coats, 
Frederic Feklc.ai 
hair products to 
30-inch LCD TVs. 
Truth be told, this 
episode is compa-
rable to a religious 
pilgrimage experi-

. ence (picture 200 
women crying, 
screaming and 
flailing their arms 
about), one that 
starts to build my 
excitement about 
Christmas and 
encourages hour- ' 
10.ng co~ve~sations 
WIth my sIster to 

I suppose it's ·that 
t/ting we call 'holiday 
spirit. J That J ar the 
fact that it's one of 

the biggest sale 
periods of the year 
and shoppers are 

going cr~. II 

has not actually 
had any hits since 
about 1992, it's a 
wonder how eftI'y 
Christmas , 
Stewart still man-
ages to produce a 
"best of" album, 
How many "best 
of" albums Can 
one man produce' 
A quick glimpse of 
the Ubest of" list 
this season shows 
that almost any-
one, regardless of 
how long they've 
been recording or 

plan our debut on next year's 
show. 

ThaDb to Oprah and her show, 
for the next month or so I do the 
whole getting-into-the-spirit-of-
things thing; I love putting up the 
ChJ:istmas tree at home, baking 
Christmas cookies and mince pies. 

- HeU, I even low: the kitschy tinsel. 
But getting into the spirit of 

things is really an acuse for mar-
keters to tap in on those who are 
starry-eyed from aU the red and 
green. Marketers make the most 
of the season and the spending 
habits of the public, and manage to 
successfully lure them into the 
Christmas trap. Christmas is the 
season for losing our inhibitions. 
No, I'm not talking about getting 
drunk off the mulled wine and 
champagne or those fashion faux 
pas, aka the people who wear 
snowmen and reindeer sweaters. 
Forget about Christmas being the 
season for givi.ng; in my opinion, 
it's the season of unnecessary "best 
of" compilations, Tim Allen 
·movies and Christmas-themed 
albums by struggling tecording 
artists. And for some obS<'Ul'e rea-
son - which will leave me won-
dering as I drift in' and out of my 
tryptophan-induced naps - th~ . 
movies and albums always do real-
ly well at the box office and on the 
music charts. 

While the holiday season is an 
exciting time for Hollywood, as 
this week's holiday. movie previews 
wiU attest to, it's alIO • time for 
some really abysmal memes to hit 

how many actual 
hits they have, can 

put together a -best of" album. 
The other option for those who 
haven't been on the MTV rota-
tion long enougn (and by long 
enough, I mean 8 months) is the 
"Christmas hits" album, which 
can always make the most of the 
holiday season. Do we really need 
to hear Clay Aiken singinlf "0 
Holy Night"? Marketers know 
that putting the magical words 
"best of" and "Christmas Hits" on 
a CD cover during Christmas is 
going to produce a guaranteed 
wiMer. . 

So why does this ·happen? We 
know that those "Chrisanls hits" 
albums will only be in the stereo 
for a muimum of two weeks 
before they're placed back OIl the 
CD rack and never .listened to 
again. We know how bad those 
Christmas mOvies· are going to be. 

. We also know that Rod Stewart is 
probably going to come out with 
another "best of" album next year. 
So why do we get suclcered into 
the world of Christmas market· 
ing? It's because we're so busy 
getting into the holiday spirit, and 
being blinded from the red and 
green, the mistletoe. and the old 
man in the red 5uit at the same 
time. Get into the holiday spitit by 
all means - just don't lose your 
good taste in your choice of enter-

~inment.

Take a break from frantic studying for finals by visiting this min-
imalist exh(bition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in La 
Jolla. On display are worles from the original practitioners of 
minimalism such as Agnes Martin and Sol ~eWitt. as well as 
those by Californian artists who integrate relevant contemporary 
content into striking minimalist forms. These worles take mini-
malism beyond an American framework by exposing how ideas of 
this innovative movement have affected Latin American and 
global artwork. 

Pedro the Lion Dec. 10 @ tH c-.. 
As the fall days wind themselves down slowly toward the first of 
winter, find consolation from the early dark - and stinging 
finals - in the soothing melancholia of Pedro the Lion, the 
stage name for singer/songwriter Dave Buan and his shifting 
lineup of instrumentalists. Bazan 's heartfelt ~minations on 
love, spriruality and conflic~ grace simple, mellow rock arrange-
ments, building into emotionally charged climaxes that comfort 
like your old blanlcie. Snuggle up to Pedro the Lion Dec. 10 at 
the Casbah. 

'Le Dolce fita' Dec. 6 @ Ken CillelU 
Welcome to 1960 Rome - a dty of beauty, glamour and sin. 
Filmed on the side streets, clubs and bars of Rome, the classic 
and controversial film by Federico Fellini follows the you!lg. 
impressionable Marcello - a journalist hungry for nothing 
more than some juicy gossip and knowledge about the hedonis-
tic "sweet life" of Rome. Watch as he rumbles into the tangled 
web of sexual promiscuity, deceit and lust. It is a web woven by 
Rome's celebrities and aristocrats - the very same people who 
helped fill the pages he once wrote, and those who. ultimately 
dictate' his fate.

'Tlusday N~ Thill' a 
watering hole for SO hipsters 
Monthly MCASD event relishes in 
fun crowd, contemporarY culture 

IyJIAGU 
Staff Writer 

Thursday nights - once an evening reserved solely by the undergrad, for the undergrad 
and of the undergrad - have lost 
their drinlc-until-comatose conno-
tations. 

Now. however, the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, San Diego has 
re-established Thursday night as 
that thing you do - or more 
specifically, that thing artists, 
bohemi:ms and aging hipsters do. 
in the pristine glow of white space 

" 

into his work - including photog-
raphy and architectural renderings 
- Morales investigates the strate-
gies employed by street vendors in 
maximizing the potential of their 
streetcars, and street vendors' 
effects on the urban landscape of 
major California cities. IPod lovers 
couldn't help but reminisce over 
their favorite commercials when 
viewing Morales' flat, digitized 
images - brilliant stencils of streei: 
vendors set in white. Upstairs, a 
26-foot-long Buddha balloon 
inflated and deflated while a Jive 
yoga perfonnance uncurled to the 

and spinning video 
projections. The 
cunningly titled 
Thursday Night 
Thing (TNT) 
offers intrlgumg 
programs the first 
Thursday of every 
month - ranging 
from DJ lessons, 
live yoga and poet-
ry readings to 
break-dancing 
classes, artist's talles 
and slide jams. In 
line with MCASD's 
Cerca Series, a . 
string of exhibi-
tions featuring up-

TNT is one of the 
few watering holes 
where people can 
still gather ... and 

hiss of its lealcing 
air. The night cul-
minated with DJ 
sets by TIjuana 
artist Nortec' 
Collective and 
Torolab, and a visit 

_ by Morales. 
This month's 

1NT will contin-
ue the arbitrary 
artistry of months 
past, opening with 
the launch ,of 
"Cerca Series: 

engage in intricate 
rituals of people 

watching and wine Mdanie Smith," a 
video and photog-
raphy installation 
titled "Six Steps to 

guzzling. " 
to-the-minute art and artists, 
TNT couples fresh contemporary 
culture with an atmosphere of 
cuttthroat cool, sporting a full bar, 
acoustic noise and a long line of 
gorgeous people. In the San Diego 
wasteland of sunshine and eye 
candy, TNT is one of the few 
watering holes where people can 
still gather on a Thursday evening 
and engage in intricate riruals of 
people .watching and wine guz-
zling. 

On Nov. 2, TNT showcased 
"Informal Economy Vendors," 
Cerca Series artist Julio Morales' 
worles examining the street ven-
dors of Tijuana, Los Angeles and 
San Francisco. Integrating various 
digital and technological mediums 

Reality" by the English artist, who 
now lives and worles in Mexico 
City. Developed in collaboration 
with Rafael Ortega, Smiths work 
explores relationshi ps between the 
object of presentation and its own 
production. Bulbo TV (from 
neighboring Tijuana) will also be 
featuring its latest works and 
debuting its new magazine. 
Musical accompaniments by Mario 
Escovedo (The Dragons), Pete 
Thurston, Gregory Page, Billy 
Shaddox (Billy Midnight), Jimmy 
Lewis (Superunloader) and Ryan 
Ferguson (No Knife) will be held 
in the upstairs gallery. 1NT will 
take place Dec. 2 at 7 .p.m., at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art, 
San Diego.

Wilson was the team's most 
prolific attacker this season, 
recording double digits in kills in 
24 of UCSDs 29 matches in the 
regular season. She averaged a 
team-high 4.41 kills per game and 
her 439 kills place her atop the sin-
gle-season kills list at UCSD. 
Although she transferred to UCSD 
her sophomore year, Wilson fin-
ished third on the all-time career 
kills list with 1,116. 

Crandell is perhaps the team's 
most improved player, hitting at a 
.330 clip, up 100 points from last 
season. The outside hitter averaged 
2.48 kills per game and 1.72 digs 
per game. In addition, she played 
huge in CCAA matches, hitting 
.370, the highest mark among non-
middle blockers . . 

Facchini has crafted ~ solid 
rookie campaign at libero with 3.07

Women's basketba-II triumphs 
8y KELU PRAKASH 

Contributing Writer 

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team battled from 10 down in 
the first half to take control of its 
Nov. 28 afternoon matchup with 
the Humboldt State Lumberjacks. 
The 70-63 victory at the 
Humboldt State East Gym in 
Arcata, Calif., improved the 
Tritons' record to 2-1 in what was 
the team's final tune-up before 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association action. . 

After falling behind, 21-11, 
with eight minutes left in the first 
half, the Tritons relied on swut 
defense and aggressive offensive 
play to gain the halftime lead at 
32-25. 

The Lumberjacks got no clos-
er than within five points of the 
Tritons during the second half, as 
UCSD held off any hopes of a 
comeback with a high .406 sec-
ond-half shooting average from 
the field and .455 from behind the 
three-point arc. 

The Tritons generated a huge 
second-half improvement in 
shooting, much w the relief of

Play resumes as soon as the disc is 
picked up. When a player catches 
the disc, he:. must remain in place 
on a pivot foot, like when a play-
er has the ball in basketball, until 
he throws the disc again. The 
defender guarding the player 
with the disc is allowed to stall 
count, which is a period of 10 
seconds between the time that 
the disc is caught ~nd thrown 
again. If it is not thrown, then a 
turnover is called. 

Defenders are not allowed to 
touch the player who has posses-
sion of the disc and must keep a 
distance of at least the width of a 
Frisbee in order to allow move-
ment. 

Regional and national tourna-
ments are played in the spring 
after the regular season. 
Traditionally, the major regional 
rivals for the UCSD "A" team, 
Squid Ice, are UC Santa Barbara 
and defending national champion 
Colorado. 

Recent changes in the national 
tournament format have opened 
the door for two teams in the 
West region to advance, setting 
the stage for an intensely-contest-
ed three-way battle for those 
positions. 

"We're going to have a good 
season, " senior captain Scott Davis 
said. "Our goal for the season IS to 
do as well or better than last year." 

Squid Ice finished the 2004 
spring season in fifth place nation-
ally. 

Fellow senior captain Adam 
Desjardins, Davis, and juniors 
Quinn Kennett, Andy Ferguson, 
and Matthew Hefferman are 
expected to lead Squid Ice through 
the season as dominant players. 

"The first big test of the season 
will be the [UCSD-hosted) Prez 
Day tournament over President~ 
Day weekend," Davis said. ""The 
best teams in the nation usually 
turn.out for that." 

The Squids anticipate serious 
competit:ion and a chance to eval-
uate the sO'engths of their biggest 
rivals. 

"Colorado is a big rival because 
they Iliually win the ' regioQ. " 
senior David Anderson said. 
"Santa Barbara is a rival because ... 
well, we just hate Santa Barbara." 

Last season, UC Santa 
Barbara was disqualified from 
nationals. contention after officials 
determiaed' that there was an 
ineligible ' player on the roster, 
while ~or.do went .o&\ to beat 
UC Berkeley in the final match. 

Squid Lite, the UCSD "B" 
team, is considered the foremost 
secondary team in the nation. 

"There has been a rivalry with 
the Stanford 'B' team," senior 
Keith Haclcbarth said, "but last, 
year, we just crean1ed them, so that 
is sort of dying out. " . 

-Squid Lite is such a dominant 
force on the field, that in the 2004 
regional tournament, the team 
managed to score eight points 
against UC Santa Barbara's "An 
team. 

"Normally, when an 'N. team 
plays a 'B' team, they thinlc of it as 
a bye or a warmup," Haclcbarth 
said. "But when a lot of teams play 
us, even if we get beat, we're 
always competitive. [Eight) is a lot 
of points considering that [UC 
Santa Barbara) was one of the top-
10 teams in the nation." 

In recent years, the San Luis 
Obispo "An team has emerged as 
a competitive rival for Squid Lite.

Squids dominate preseason SoCal Tournament 
Men's ultimate team goes 8-1 before rain stops the show 

Owners 
have· wish 
lists, too 

Greg Dale/Guordian 
Air squid: Squid seniors Andy Sammons (left) and Alex Zimmerman reach for 
the diSC at a match that was part of the Nov. 11 SoCal Tournament. 

By MATTHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

Though the second day of its 
own Nov. 21 SoCal Tournarqent 
was canceled due to rain, it was not 
difficult to see the strength of the 
Squids ultimate Frisbee teams. 
UCSDs ultimate program is for-
midable enough that the large 
group was divided into three teams 
for the event, which combined for 
an 8-1 record. Although the tour-
nament was called off before a 
champion could be crowned, the 
Squids are a .c1ear threat for both 
the regional and national tourna-
ments in the spring season. 

Ultimate is played on a field 
that resembles a football field in 
that it is rectangular with end 
zones at both ends, but is shorter 
and wider, measuring 70 yards by 
40 yards. 

The object of the- game is to 
score points in the end zone and to 
be the first team to score 13, 15 or 

. 

17 points in the end zone, depend-
ing on the format and number of 
teams in a tournament. 

Each team is allowed to have 
seven players on the field during a 
game, plus substitutes. The 
Squids, because they are such a 
large organization, have two teams 
composed of between 25 and 30 
members each. 

The NCAA refuses to recog-
nize ultimate as a collegiate sport 
because the game is self-officiated. 
Until recently, high-intensity 
games -like those that deterrnine 
tournament \vinners - have been 
plagued by frequent foul calls and 
excessive refereeing by athletes. 
However, recent amendments to 
rules have allowed for observers, 
who approve or deny questionable 
calls that players on the field make. 

Turnovers happen when the 
disc is dropped, intercepted or 
blocked by the defending team.

Three players named AlI--American 

Tritons remain 
unbeaten at 

RIMAe 
By JOE TEVELOWITZ 

Contributing Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team held onto an early advan-
tage, despite late-game lead 
changes, for a 59-56 victory over 

. Chapman on Nov. 29 at RIMAC 
Arena. The Tritons remain unde-
feated at home and even theIr 
record at 2-2 as the team heads 
into CCAA conference play with a 
home game against Cal State 
Bakersfield on Dec. 3. 

Sophomore guard Robby Peters 
led the Tritons in scoring with 14 
points on four-of-six shooting from 
the three-point range and two-of-
four shooting from the foul line . . 

Freshman guards Clint Allard 
and Andrew Hatch scored 13 and 
11 points, respectively. 

Sophomore forward Parker 
Berling, who scored 47 combined 
points over the two previous 
games, was held to four points on 
one- of-five shooting from the 
field, but led the Tritons with his 
five rebounds. 

The Panthers were led by 
guard Patrick Carney and his 20-
point performance, and three 
oth~r players who collected game-
high six rebounds each. Overall, 
Chapman outrebounded the 
Tritons, 35-28, but was held to 
less than AOO shooting from the 
field by a tenacious UCSD 
defense that also recorded five 
steals and four blocks and forced 
17 Panther tmnovers. 

The Tritons, who built a 20-11 
lead with 8 minutes and 47 sec-
onds remaining in the first half, 
went scoreless for more than 
seven minutes before a jumper by 
Allard and a layup by junior guard 
Zach Zanolli gave UCSD a 24-23 
halftime advantage over 
Chapman.

Seven named to All-CCAA team; Ohta is MVP 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

Senior setter Teresa Ohta, 
senior middle blocker Katie 
Hogan and senior outside hitter 
Bonnie Wilson of the UCSD 
women's volleyball players were 
selected to the 2004 American 
Volleyball Coaches Association 
All-American team on Nov. 29. 
Ohta was named to the First 
Team for the second consecutive 
year, Wilson earned Third Team 
honors and Hogan got 
Honorable Mention. 

Ohta, the all-time UCSD 
assists leader (4,749), was also 
named California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Most 
Valuable Player by the CCAA 
coaches on Nov. 17. Triton head 
coach Duncan McFarland was 
also awarded CCAA Coach of 
the Year and seven Tritons were 
chosen for the AJI -CCAA con-
ference teams: Senior middle 
blocker Kendra Canape, senior 
outside hitter Stacy Dunsmore, 
Hogan, Ohta, and' Wilson took 
A11-CCAA First Team honors . 
Junior outside hitter Lindsay 

Crandell and freshman Iibero 
Natalie Facchini were voted 
into the A11-CCAA Second 
Team. 

Ohta engineered the Triton 
offense that averaged 16.53 kills 
per game and hit .302 . In the 
2004 season, she tallied 1,329 
assists, 87 kills, 30 aces, 259 digs 
and 32 blocks. She ran a quick 
offense and handily set up passes 
for her teammates. She also held 
her own defensively, brealc.ing the 
1,000 digs mark earlier this sea-
son. The Triton team captain led 
a team that yielded in a remark-
able 30-2 overall finish, including 
a perfect 18-0 record in CCAA 
play. 

McFarland guided his team 
to its best league record since its 
jump to Division II in 2000 and 
claimed its first CCAA title . In 
addition, his team maintained a 
steady No. 2 national ranking 
and earned the top seed in the 
NCAA Pacific Region~1 play-
offs. 

Dunsmore finished her career 
by breaking the all-time UCSD 
kills record with 1,182 and plac-
ing second on the all-time digs 

record. She became the first play-
er in UCSD history to reach 
1,000 Ic.ills and 1,000 digs. She 
averaged 2.99 kills and 3.16 digs 
per game this season. 

Hogan finished the season 
with .uCSD's single-season 
highest hitting percen~age of 
.399 and third in career blocks 
with 360. She tallied a second-
best 107 blocks during the regu-
lar season at the middle blocker 
position and averaged 2.91 kills 
per game. Hogan also had the 
second best hitting percentage, 
trailing Canape with .347. A 
reliable player, Hogan came up 
clutch for the Tritons at several 
occasions with a Ic.ill or a block 
to take the lead or close out a 
game. 

Canape, also a middle blocker, 
finished her career with the high-
est hitting percentage, .3 51, and 
led the team with 109 blocks dur-
ing the season. Averaging 2.28 
kills per game, Canape was a 
spark plug on the court and her 
energy often provided the physi-
cal and mental boost for her

As the holiday season fast approaches, NFL teams in California have begun to 
take part in the time-honored tra-
dition of holiday wish lists. And 
whi.le 110 team will prObably get nil 
it hopes for, here are a few things 
our beloved California team will 
benefit most from in the upcoming 
New Year. 

Some might say Chri. l m:lS 
came early for the surprising 8-3 
San Diego Chargers. fter posting 
a 4-12 record last year and being 
expected to perform even worse 
this year, the Chargers have 
watched the development of a 
Pro-Bowl-caliber tight end in 
Antonio Gates and the emer"ence 
of an MVP-caliber quarterback in 
Drew Bree . However, "II thi~ SIlC-
cess might be a curse of its own fllr 
the Chargers, for as they w~n;h 
Brees bloom, they continue to pay 
Phillip Rivers, first-round pick 
this past year and supposed QB of 
the future, as if he were starting. 
While they might be able to afford 
such a hefty price tag now, come 
next year the team will be cor-
nered into deciding whether it 
really feels comfortable with 
Rivers or prefers to stick with 
what has thus far been the very hot 
hand of Brees. Hopefully the 
Chargers will be able to absorb the 
financial hit and possible ego-
bruising of dealing with a quarter-
back they thought would be great 
(and still might be), and ·sticking 
with one whom they had mistreat-
ed and doubted and who has since 
proven them wrong. 

While the Chargers rise, the 
4gers continue their historic fall. 
A team that was an example of 
excellence in the NFL for so 
many years is now reduced to 
nothing more than a laughing-
stock. After the player~friendly 
reign of former owner Eddie 
DeBartolo, Jr., ended and the 
profit-first regime of John York 
and Terry Donahue began, Niner 
fans everywhere watched as the 
greatest wide receiver in NFL nis-
tory left, a Pro Bowf quarterback 
was released, and an enigmatic 
superstar was traded away and has 
since flourished. While the team 
promises that it is preparing to be 
in good salary cap space for the 
futQre, the only gift that could 
save this team is new ownership, 
and while there have been parties 
interested in acquiring and 
rebuilding the fading franchise, so 
far there have been no signs of 
willingness to sell. As such, all the 
Niners really deserve for 
Christmas is a college player who 
distinguishes himself as worthy of 
being the number-one overJII 
pick in next year's draft. 

The Oakland Raiders might be 
wishing they could return some 
"gifts" underneath their Chrisml<ls 
tree. The signings of aging players 
Warren Sapp, Ted Washington and . 
Kerry Collins haven't proven nearly. 
as successful as the team must have 
hoped. Washington has recorded 
one sadt, which is half of a sack more 
than converted defensive end Sapp.
