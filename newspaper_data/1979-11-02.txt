Regents Study Probes 
Earthquake Safely 

By Peter Mortensen . 
A UC Regents ·commil>sioned study on the 

earthquake safety of University Hospital is 
expected to be released within the next two 
weeks , according to university authorities. 

The so·called "earthquake ri k analysis" was 
instituted becaul>e the Regent!> are considering 
buying the hospital, said Win Cox of the UCSD 
School of Medicine Public Affairs Office. The 
Hillcrest hospital is presently owned by the 
county.

Bla~er' s SpokesDlan Accuses Jackson 
Of Indifference to 'Israeli Interests 

By Cindy Beveridge 
Staff Writer 

The public relations director for 
Phil Blazer spoke to a large audience 
last night about the Israeli acttvist's 
dissociation with the Reverend Jesse 
Jackson during his recent trip to the 
Middle East. Hal Sloane spoke in 
place of Blazer, who was ill, at a 
Humanities·Library lecture hall. 

Blazer, publisher ot Israel '/O<IOY, 
helped coordinate Jackson's itinerary 
but halfway through the trip 
dissociated himself and his 
organization with the Reverend, 
brandin.g the prominent black 
leader's intentions as a "sham." 

" I am convinced Jesse Jackson 
cares not one bit about Israeli 
interests ... the trip has become less 'a 
matter of moral persuasjon and more 
a mailer of personal gain," said 
Sloane, reiterating earlier comments 
by Blazer. 

Blazer first met Jackson while both 
we~e protesting a pro-Nazi 
demonstration in Illinois, after which 
the two developed a close 

relation!>hip, according to Sloane. 
Soon after the demonstration, Blazer 
and Jackson discussed the possibility 
of a Middle East trip to get a "first 
hand look at the realities of the Middle 
East." 

Their object, says Sloane, was to 
make "truly informed evaluations" 
concerning Isr ae l and the 
Palestinians. 

Sloane, who along with Blazer 
accompanied Jackson, opened the 
discusl>ion with a slide presentation of 
the trip and later talked about the 
development and subsequent 
deterioration of the relationship 
between the two. The friendship that 
once existed has since become 

"unpl~asant," according to Sloane. 
Communication between the two has 
instead become one of animosity as 
Jackson "bitterly opposes" the 
allegations made toward him, he said. 

Blazer said in a news release he 
dissociated himself with Jackson 
because the Reverend was "looking 
for support for pre-conceived 
conclusions he had already made. 
before the trip. He is more concerned 
with his own public image and with 
the PLO than with vital Israeli 
interests. " 

However, several in the audience 
questioned Blazer's "misguided 
optimism" in dealing with the Jackson 
group in the first place. In response, 
Sloane said that had they not 
accompanied him on the trip, "there 
would have been nobody to call the 
turn; we called the turn. We 

recognized his preprogrammed 
rhetoric eiuly in the trip. " 

ince the dissociation , loan said, 
" I think hil> (Jackson's) credibility has 
suffered immens Iy ," 

"Despite his (Jackson's) intent he 
has succeeded in uniting the I rael 
people ... against the PLO." This is in 
direct contrast to Jackson's reported 
intentions for encouraging the PLO to 
recognize Israel and for Israel to 
neJ(otiate them. 

Throughout the trip, Carter 
adminil>tration officials contended 
that Jackson did not represent either 
the American government or Middle 
Ea!>t policies. On the contrary, the 
tenl>ion wrought by high media 
allention and international publicity 
reportedly caused the Carter 
administration embarrassment. 

Jackson was reported as saying he 
made the trip as a private citizen out 
of the desire to encourage 
negotiations between ISniel and the 
PLO. However, Jackson hal> been 
criticized for imposing what some feel 
should be kept within the bounds of 
diplomatic policie:..

UCSD Israel Action Committee. 

localize and update information on the 
hospital's stress performance. 

Johnson explainl> that a study was conducted 
throughout the UC system judging campul> 
building l>trength as related to the most severe 
earthquake thai could occur in the San 
Francisco area. 

"With thay' he added, "the hospital rated 
very poorly. 

'''We had been given ,criteria that were not 
necessarily reality," he continued. "Now we 
,have asked, 'What could be anticipated for the 
area in which University Hospital is located?' 
And; given that anticipation over. a l00-year 
cycle, how would the building be expected to 
perform?" 

Although Johnson avoided calling the study 
"routine," he did say he would call it at this point 
"something we should not .get excited about. 
When the report is out, that's the time to look at , 
the whole thing in perspective." 

According to Chuck Powers, campUl> 
architect, more definitive information will be 
available next Thurl>day. Beyond this, Powers 
declined to comment on the study, stating, "I 
think it would be more appropriate to have the 
information received by the campus and by the 
Regents than it would be to have assumptions 

Imade." 
. 

This most current in.depth study of the 
hospital grew out of a preliminary report 
dealing with the structure' safety several 
months ago. Data for the lotudy i being 
compiled and pr~ eoted by Seismic 
Engineering Aswicates, Ltd. in Lol> Arureles. 

The study was initiated before the Oct. 15 
Imperial Valley earthquake; the research 
began long before the temblor shook the San 
Diego area with a 6.4 jolt on the Richer Scale. 

Dr. Marvin Dunn, Acting Dean of the UCSD 
School of Medicine is out of town thi!> week and 
was unavailable for comment. Sheldon King, 
University Hospital president, also declined to 
comment on the study situation.

'Renaming' Idea Limited 
Editor: 

The Third Colle~e Student Council would like to ca ll a llention 
to 1he Daily Gucrrdian's Ol.:\. 29 article abou t the sUPP0lted 
attempt to rename Third College. The headline was false and the 
article was filled with misleading innuendos. For the purposes uf 
those conl.:erned about Third College, we would like to explain 
what the actual issue was about. 

Firsl of all, the proposal was nol whether to rename the college . 
The proposal was to put Lumumba.Zapata-Third College on a 
new letterhead for the student council. This was not an arbitrary 
decision; both "Lumumba·Zapata" and "Third " have a great deal 
to do with the history and ideas of our I.:ollege. 

The proposal wall brought to a meeting of the Student Forum, 
which is a representative body I.:on si~ting of Third College 
students who are actively involved in any Third College 
organizations. After deliberation over t.he proposal, it was 
decided, by 24 to 4 vote,' to put our offil.:ial temporary name, 
"Third Colle~e," on the student c.:ouncil ~tationery. 

The main reason for the decision not to put LumumbaZapiita. 
'Ihinl on the stationery was that the student:; felt it walt not an 
effective means of promo"ng the history or goals of the college. 
However, the Student Forum was overwhelminl{ly in favor of 
promoting the unique history of the lhird College, of whit'h 
Lumllmba -Zapata is a major pari. 

If any further elucidation i~ needed, the Third Colleue Student 
Counl.:il will encouraJ{e and ilnllwer ilny questionll. Contact the 
Third College Dean's Office at 45~-4390.

True Colors Show 
A graduate student who has been writing letters to this 

paper for years . he is a ' generally stubborn and bilious 
advocate of conllervative positions - brought in a le tter 
recently about abortion. He was angry that health insurance 
covering UCSD students should be used for abortions, but not 
for the expense of carrying a child for nine months and giving 
birth to it. The policy , he said discriminates again!>t women 
who want to have children by only providing enough money 
for the less costly option· abortion. 

It was a cogent, well-stated argument, though basically 
another elaborate construct designed to attack abortion; the 
student would prefer to have all such insurance benefits 
eliminated rather than have them extended to women who 
want to have babies as well as to those who want abortions. 
But he unintentionally did in his eloquence by resorting , in an 
exasperated moment when honesty won out over posturing, 
to a particularly spiteful term. He left it out of his final version, 
because our editor wouldn't allow it to be Printed. The editor 
was right, but the deletion of the offending phrase allowed the 
author to maintain a deception that is c.ommon among many 
people who nobly call themselves pro·lifers. 

What he did was refer to women who become pregnant and 
want abortions as "careless sluts." In doing so he committed a 
fundamental strategic error; those two words said more about 
his real moral attitudes than the dozens of pages he has 
written about the " right to life, " To him , women, and he 
obviously meant unmarried UCSD students, who had sex 
were "sluts." "Slut" is a term that has nothing to do with 
conception or the absence of conception, abortion or giving 
birth; it is a term that is applied to women who have sex in 
instances in which certain people think they should nol. lbe 
student's real objection to extra·marital sex was so 
overwhelming that it allowed him to negate the logic of the 
elaborate argument he had devised to mask his abhorrence. 
"Careleu slut," if one accepts the usual definition of the term 
by the kind of people who enjoy using it, does not apply to 
women who conceive children with their husbands. Therefore 
this student had adopted a stan'ce against abortion that was 
implicitly based only on his objection to sex and abortion 
among people who have sex out of wedlock. His "pro-life" 
attitude, then, was either perversely twisted or completely 
artificial. 

Andrew Hacker recently argued in Harper's that the clash 
between pro-choice and pro·life advocates hides a more 
basic dispute about sexual freedom. (NOW's Sandy 
Ackerson echoe<l this attitude in her remarks at UCSD's 
prochoice rally last week: "The pro-lifers are advocating 
punishment for having sex for any reason other than 
procreation.") Conservative, "Christian" America lost its 
battle against premarital sex in the 60s; the advocates of 
traditional attitudes toward sex and family regrouped to form 
the nucleus of the opposition to abortion~ and to government 
funding for them. Hacker believes most t;>ro-life arguments 
mask middle America 's objections to the lifestyles of their 
offspring. And most pro·choicers , he believes , share a belief 
in the rights of individuals to pick their own moral codes. 

Though opposition to abortion can be based on a sincere 
religous or moral objection, most anti-abortion rhetoric is still 
fundamentally linked to traditional attitudes about sex and 
family . People will undoubtedly object to the suggelttion that 
they rely on generalized political or moral codes instead of 
considering each issue separately. But most people do arrive 
at issue po~itions by referring to their general philosophical 
stance; a pro-abortion conservative Republican congressman 
from a rural state is as much a rarity as an anti· abortion liberal 
from an urban district. Arid when pro-choicers held a rally last 
week on the steps of the gym, the opening song was about 
Mayor Pete Wilson and San Diego'~ pro·corporate policiel>, 
not abortion. 

Leftists are more honest about linking abortion to other 
issues . They !oCe a woman'lt right to determine the outcome of 
a pregnancy in terms of her right to e~cape restric tions 
imposed by social and economic inequities. They see legal 
rel>trictions on abor tions , or the costliness of an unltubsidized 
abortion to a poQr woman, as a way to coment social barrier. 
that confine poor and minority women. Libera llt sometimes 
forget tha t abortion is often a form of birth I.:ontrol for middle 
and upper· class women. It is true, but it sounds less politically 
righteous than the arguments about poor women.} 

The conltervatives, on the other hand, rely on references to 
the sanctity value of human life. This is especially odd, 
becaulte it is the American liberal who has. ever since the New 
Deal. been interested in elevating the quality of life in 
impoverished sectors of society and who has struggled to 
unite. working imd minority people in the effort. Conservative!> 
talk ahout individual initiative and self-reliance and have 

, always argued against relltrictions on individual freedom. (It 
is issues like abortion that separate conltervativeli< from 
libertarians; they are illllues that prove mOlt conservatives are 
interested in more freedom for corporations and less for 
individuals, and that a conl>ervative'l> idea of individual righb 
do not extend to the control of one 'lo own body and ib 
impulses and functions.) . 

On abortion, we are to believe, the conservativelt are the 
advocates of the weak, liberals the callous elitiltts, definitions 
that are at odds with the recent political history of this country. 
If we accept Hacker's argument. pro-tifers use abortion, 
trumpeting all the while a newfound interest in human dignity 
that ill rarely reflected in other conservative ill&ue positions, to

Ci;lnadians to "come to terms with our destiny," 
withdraw from the Canadian confederation and 
establish a new nation with a ll the powers of a 
sovereign country. 

In an official "white paper," the Parti Quebecois 
government proposed a "sovereignty·association" 
plan by which Quebec would be self-ruling but 
maintain c10lte economic ties with Canada - a 
common currency, free trade and the free movement 
of people a nd capital. 

" We Queb cers a re a nation , the most firmly

Guevara had be n in office less than three months. 

Students and workers opposed to the takeover by 
Col. Alberto Natusch took to the streets of Lhe

opened fire, and police sources a nd witnesse~ said at 
least five civi lians were killed a nd dozens wounded. 

The 47 -year·old Nalusch declared himself 
preltident a nd said he would guarantee freedom for 
Bolivia 's political parties. 

Newspapers and radio stations throughout the

Bailout for Chrysler 
WASHINGTON - The Carter administration, 

saying emnomic stability must be prelterved, asked 
Congress yesterday to approve up to $ 1.5 billion in 
federal loan guarantees to help the struggling 
Chrysler Corp. avert bankruptcy. 

The proposed aid package is roughly double the 
sum the administration previously indicated it would 
be willing to seek from Congress to .keep the na tion's 
No. 3 automaker afloat. 

The a id pal.:kage - large~t proposed financial 
bai lout of a US corporation in history - is intended 
to "m a ke sure this industry remains a viable part 'Of

said at a news conference. 

" It's important to us as a nation to maintain a

two men push themselves into the spotlight yesterday 
as jockeying for that party's presidential nomination 
continued, 

Tennessee Senator Howard Baker announced his 
candidacy in the Senate Caucus room to a crowd that 
included 24 of 41 Republican senators. 

And Ronald Reagan announced tha t he il> buying

Brown Backs 4 
LOS ANGELES - Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 

today endorsed Proposition 4, the state and local 
spending limit initiative known as the "Spirit of 13," 
calling it an opportunity "to gain power from the 
politicians. " 

" I see in Proposition 4 an idea that the people 
should make the decisions about how much 
government should spend," Brown told a news 
conference at his downtown office. "It's not perfect, 
but it is a continuing experiment" in the ellort of the 
pub'lic to have more say in government. 

The Nov . 6 ballot measure by Proposition] 3 co-
author Paul Gann would place a spending limit on 
each local government. 

The limit would increase annually with the · 
consumer price index, plus a proportional adjustnient 
for population growth. 

If a state or local government were to collect more 
money than the limit allows, they would have to 
return int to the people within two years. 

Oil Tax Goes on TV 
SACRAMENTO - Supporters of a proposed 

ballot measure to tax oil companies for mass transit 
unveiled yesterday what may be a first, a television 
commercial aimed at gathering voter signatures. 

The 30-second ad, scheduled for next week on 
Sacramenlo stations, depicts oil companiell a" pigs at 
a trough while huge third-quarter profits of majo~ oil 
firms, ranging up to 191 percent over last year for / 
Standard Oil of Ohio, are shown on the scree". 

The words "Tax Pig Oil" appear, and then the "P" 
is changed to a "8." 

"There is, perhaps, a question of taste," the leader 
of the initiative drive, Bill Press, former director of

Revelle and Others at Forum ~ 
By Jeffrey S. Lee 

A total of eight people, 
including Roger Revelle, 
lihowed up last night at the 
final open forum discussing 
the future of the university-
owned stabl~. 

any land held by the 
university that is not used 
for "academic purposes" 
should be sold . Powers 
said, however , that the 
stables property is not 
planned for sale, but rather 
is up for lease. 

\ 

The final say on what 
happens to the land is in 
the hand:. of the Regents , 
Powers said, to which 
Revelle commented "The 
one thing the Regents a re 
careful about is th e ir 
property." 

Revelle said he would 
like to !lee the la nd 
developed into a I>tudent-
oriented area similar to 
Berkel ey ' s Telegraph 
Avenue. 

He si1id uest) is much 
too isolated for the students. 

" It' s a damn good place 
academically, but it ' l> lousy 
for the students :.ocially ." 

Revelle attended the 
forum, much to the surprise 
of the campus planneYll, 
because the said "this issue 
is very important to me." 

Although two students 
~lIggested that the land be 
kept as s tables, the genera l 
consensus was that the la nd 
b e d eve lop e d into a 
commercial area. 

VISTA/Peace Corps Rep on Campus 
However, this does not 

seem to be the allude ' of 
the campUl, as Campus 
Architect Chuck Powers 
said the turnout was equally 
small at the previous 
foruma;. 

The forums, ~onliored 
by Chancellor McElroy and 
presented by representatives 
from the Campus.Communi-
ty Planning Committee and 
the Office of Architect, and 
engineers, focused on the 
topic of what should be 
done with the land, and 
how it lihould be done. 

According to Powers, the 
lIlabia have been put under 
a mandate which stateti that 

A national VISTA eHort to 
reach potential college s tudent 
volunteers, part of the 15th 
anniversary observance of the 
anti-poverty program, comes 
to UeSD Nov. 6. 

Linda Lane, a Los Angeles-
based VIST A and Peace 
Corps representative, plans to 
contact campus clubs and 
organizatic;ms in addition to 

~tting up an information 
booth in Revelle Plaza 9:00 
am to 2:00 pm on Nov. 7. The 
former VIST A and Peace 
Corpl> volunteer is a lso taking 
senior sign-up:. at the 
placement office for Nov. 6 
interviews. For more 
information, call x3750. 

Lane , a former VISTA 
community development 
worker in Chula Vista and a 
Peace Corps home economist 
in Colombia, said that VISTA 
i:. observing its anniversary by 
reaffirming the founding 
principles of the program to 
"help low-income communi-
ties achieve self-reliance and 
dignity by helping them-
selves." 

The role of the VISTA 
volunteers, she says, is to 
"assi:.t low -income people 
develop a capabi lit y for 
leadership and problem 
solving." The ex·volunteer 
added that there are literally 
hundreds of opportunities lor

The Dally Guardian Fl"iday, November 2, 1979 

For' Hard Workouts 
compete in a league, 
something they had never 
done while ltwimming at 
UCSD, So Coach Diana Dann 
put the team in a newly lormed 
league, the AlA W Division 
III. 

At least ten schools a"re in 
'Ihe league, bul only four have 
swim teams at this time. 
UCSD, Whittier , UC 
Riverside, and Redlands have 
teams, and Loyola may have 
a team later this season. 

The women also wanted to 
have workouts twice daily 
during winter break. Race tires 
slipped in the past after 
discontinuing practice for lour 
weeks during the holidays, 
This year, the team will work 
out during the first two week!. 
of vacation, twice a day . 

The athletes at the meeting 
decided that the team needed 
the continuity that they lacked 
in the past. So Dann started 
the swimmer~ out in the fall 
with solid SOOO.yard 
practices. Later in the year the 
team will have lour hours of 
pool time per day , and the 
yardage will eltcalate. 

Finally, the team decided ' 
that they wanted to go to the 
national AlA W meet at 
Penn State. Dann ligures that 
up to five or bix 01 her

Tomorrow the tea'm sees if 
the new practice strategy is 
working , The University of 
San Diego hosts a "strictly 
lund" tri·meel with UCSD, 
San Diego State and USD 
swimming relays againbt each 
other at 10 am. The 
comp e tition won ' l be 
cutthroat. as the meet won't 
even be scored, and all three 
teamb will meel together for a 
picnic after the races are over. ' 

Saturday'b meet and an 
intra.squad competition Nov. 
9 mostly serve to give the 
swimmers a taste of college 
level competition, and to give 
Dann an idea 01 where the 
talent lies on the team. 

MObt of the best swimmers 
from last year's team have 
returned for another year, like

Negesy Recital 

Violin Whiz Settles Here 
By Lyne tte Tom 

Senior S taff Writ er 
He W<lS a child prodigy of 

sorts. !-fruwin~ up in Europt!. 
He has very definite id ea~ o n 
how music s h ou ld be 
presented and liste ned to. But 
until hi s violin recita l last 
W ednesday nig ht nei ther 
J a nos Negesy nor his ideas 
we re kno wn to ma ny on

David A rde n , fo r an 8 pm 
p rog ram co n si:. tin g o f 
com positio n s by Bar tok. 
Beethoven. Bozay. Fu lton. 
a nd Handel. This ble nd of 
classical and contemporary 
mu si<.:, whil e unusual. is 
necessary , says Negesy. 

"There are no separate 
kind:. o f music. .but an 
evo lu tion of music, " he 

con linued. " I show this 
throll"h concerts and recitals 
so th:t the people c<ln see the 
connections between the 
<.:entllrie:.." 

Negel;y has never rea lly 
known a ny other life than tha t 
of a m u:.ician. H e star ted a t 
the age of four with instruc tion 
in pia no a nd violin . no t out o f 
his own interes t, but a t his 
pa re nt:. insistence. A ble . to 
read music before he a tlended 
school. Negesy was a t Fra nz 
Liszt Aaldemy o f M usic by 
the time he was six years o ld . 

H is fir:.t prize came in 1955 
with his participa tion in the 
Bartok Violin Compe-tition. 
H e did con<.:er t:. from 196 1 to 
1965. a ft er which he left 
Hungary. B ' tween hi:. :.tudies 
in Germany, Negesy played 
and won in severa l 
compehhons. O ther engal:te· 
ments durin'g t hi~ period 

included maj(H mllsi<.: festivals 
in Berlin, Paris. Lisbon. 
London <lnd N w York. 

From 1970 to 1974. the 
vio linist was concert master 
for t he Berli n R adio 
Or<.: hes tra, u nder the chief 
condudor. Lorin M a<lzel. 
Negesy's decision to ind ude 
contemporary mll sic in his 
repertoire <.:oi ncided with his 
leaving the orchestra to purslie 
a career as a soloist. 

" M usic is no t only for 
enjoyment ," he said . " It has to . 
wake you up and ask you 
q ues ti ons and move you 
inside. Contemporary m llsic 
has this a tt itude." 

d epartme n t. 
near /lew music" 

Negesy vislializes contem· 
porary music as a kind o f new 
languCl!:(e where the major/mi. 
nor sys tem of notes does not 
a lway:. apply. Despite this. 
people cont inue to believe, 
according to the violinist . the 
major/minor sys.\em is " the 
nature of musIc and as a 
result . they '-are lost to the 
orientation. " 

"It ·s important for the 
listen e r to !-fO to the 
performances and see how to 
produce and ~peak the ne w 
langllil!,(e on the instrument," 
he added. 

Nege~y ' s realization that 
"mllsic was not enoucrh to t · /I 
your thollghts" led him into 
teaching. He had previous 
professors h ips in varioll~ 
music conservatorie:. before 
clccepting UC D's invi ta tion. 
Negesy has received other 
teachin!,l e nga!,lemen ts from 
universi ties in I::urope, h t 

would liKe to stay in San ()iego 
beyond hi:. appoin ted one year 
term . His tea<.:hing methods 
are as innovative as is hi" 
approach to performing. 

"Mu:.ic is unly one mirror of 
our timl' ... he "aiel. " I w,mt to 
show the student" the ' 
connections between it and 
other arts." 

He also s tres:. e s the 
importanc of contemporary 
musi ' for the students in his 
cham b er music, vio lin 
seminar/performance. and 
ins t rum e n t it! in s t r 1I cI io n

Foley OverwhelOled; Iggy's Free 
By Barry AlfonlO 

Contributing Editor 
Ellen foley-Nightout (Epic) 
Best-known as the female co-vocalist on Meatloaf's Bat Out 

Of Hell LP. foley's singing style is ultraserious and full of high-
powered histrionics in the melodramatic Bruce Springsteen 
tradition, On Nightout, producers Mick Ronson and Ian Hunter 
have seen fit to envelop her with the most garish; overwroughl 
production possible, a sledgehammer-subtle approach featuring 
thunderous kickdrums and avalanches of electric guitar. 
Competing with these Wagnerian arrangements as best she can, 
foley shrieks and froths at the mouth, trying 10 make her so-so 
song material seem like accounts of ~fe-and-death crises. When 
2ut on the spot to deliver a romantic ballad. "Don't Let Go," 
Foley can't quite muster the presence to bring it off. Nightout is 
an album full of sound and fury. 

Dave Edmunds-Repeat When Necessary (Swan Song) 
Edmunds' latter-day rockabilly records have deservedly won 

critical praise in recent years, but his innate conservatism keeps 
him from expanding on the revamped cliches that characterize 
his sound. 

Repeat When Necessary is well crafted (with bassist Nick 
Lowe involved, it was bound to be) and contains several fine 
rock numbers (including previously unrecorded Elvis Costello 
and Graham Parker compositions). But the instrumental breaks 
are too carefully planned, the vocals too predictable and the 
overall effect too reminiscent of a Golden Oldies compilation. 
Look for no serious mistakes - but no surprises - here. 

Iggy Pop·New Values (Arista) 
After recording a series of LPs under the dominating influence 

of David Bowie. it's a pleasure to hear James (lggy Pop) 
Osterberg asserting his own twitchy personality once ajlain, with 
the aid of old cohorts James Williamson and Scott Thurston. 
Unlike the enervated perfonnances Iggy turned in on his last few 
albums, this time his recitations sound properly schizoid and 
thoroughly convincing. Outstanding here are "I'm Bored," 
"Curiosity" and "Five foot One" (containing the memorable 
plea, "I wish life could be Sweqish magazines"). Williamson's 
production is subdued, bul effective in its spareness. New Values 
is underplayed but broodingly powerful. 

Randy Newman - Born Again (Warner Brothers) 
The humor on Newman's new LP is tinged with a bitternell 

that makes Born Again's mood less whimsical than his 

preceding album. Little 
Criminals. The sentimental 
symphonic arrangements of 
his earlier records have been 
largely replaced by droning, 
ominous sythesizer effects. 
highlighting the threatening 
situations many of the songs 
depict. Even the more upbeat 
numbers here, slich as " Mr. 

Sheep" and "They Just Got 
Married," use genial tunes 10 
counterpoint scenes of 
callousness and insensitivity. 
Newman's cynicism, though, 
doesn't prevent him from 
being as funny as ever - "It', 
Money. That I Love" and 
"Half A Man" (a weird 
exploration of the causes of 

homosexuality) are too 
amusing to bog down in 
seriousness.

the show. but skip the album. 

In orclt!r to fully apprcciatt! 
tht! artistry of singt!r Le nny 
William s, one must consider 
the.tJ ss musical dimensions of 
his performing c haracter. TIle 
t!x-T ower of Power bId, now 
a ~olo artist with MCA , reli e~ 
strongly on his a bility to stir hi s 
(largely female) a udience to 
new emoti.onill peaks. Judging 
from last Friday night's 
performance at the Ca tamar· 
an, tnis abi lity certainly seems 
in top form . 

The lnlernoti()no/ Rollet of CaroCC/s, called "an excep tionall y 
good·looking troupe. bursting a t the seams with en thusiasm , 
vitality and ta lent" by the London Evening News, will perform Around Town 

Williams is a performer. His 
dynamic presence a nd his 
ability to comm uni ca te 
intensel y personal emotions 
are what make his music 
significant and appealing. 
Lenn y Williams has soul. The 
subjeds Williams treats are 
limit ed almost exclusively to 
the in t r·relation be tween m e n 
and women. Of course. within 
such a limit countless 
possi!Jilities exist and Williams 
explor's most of those. 

His set consisted mainly of 
~ongs from his most rt!cent LP, 
Lool! Curren/. However. he 
also managed to squeeze in a 
couple of familiar Tower 
tunes. Among these were 
"Loop d ' Loop" .and "So V e ry 
Hard To Go." Backed by a 
very competent musica l 
entourage, Williams filled the 
small jazz room wi th an 
energy and dynami(' charm 
that overpowered th e 
audiem;e. They were so 
enthralled they demanded .

Friday and Saturday, Nov. 2 a nd 3, at UCSD. . 
Pe rformances are scheduled at 8:30 p.m. Friday and 1 :30 

p.m. Saturday in Mandeville Auditorium. Tickets are avai lable 
a t Selec t·aSeat outlet~ and a t the UCSD Central Box Office. 

The company was founded in 1975 by Vicente Nebrada, 
currently artis tic director and choreographer for the company 
a nd formerly a dancer with the Ballet de Cuba, Ballet de Paris, 
the Joffrey Ballet a nd the Harkness Ballel. 

Since ils inception, the Balle t of Caracas has toured South and 
North America a nd Europe and received enthu iastic critica l 
acclaim everywhere. The company has become known not only 
for the technical ski ll of its dancers. but for the dancers' 
ebullience, agility a nd a thletic flair. 
, The Venezuelan company is compo~ed of experienced 
dancers from several countries. including Venezuela , the United 
States , Canada, Cuba a nd the Philippines. 

Zane Wil~on , Dale Talley and Manuel Molina, leading 
dancers with the company, are former members of the Harkness 
Ballet , a nd prima balerina Zhandra Rodriguez was a principal 
da ncer with lhe American Ballet Theatre before ~he returned to 
her native Venez uela ' La star with Nebrada's company . 
Rodriguez once named one of Esquire Magazine's 45 
superheroes of the dance world, along with Alicia Alonso, 
M argo t Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev a nd others. 

The dancers a ll have solid classical backgrounds and the 
troupe's repertory reflects a complete range of dancing styles, 
from classical to modern ballet and even popular dance . 

The troupe has es tablished its own character by imbuing 
many of its pieces with a distinctly Latin American accent. 
Many of Nebrada\ own works convey the unique blend of 
Spanish, India n and Negro cu ltures of South America.

Melanie-Ballroom Streets 
(Tomato) 

The roush yet childlike 
vibrato of Melanie Safka was 
well- known in the early '70s, 
but after a .tring of hits 
("Candle. In the Rain," 
"Brand New Key") she faded 

from the pop spotlight. Her 
Iate.t attempt at a comeback, 
Ballroom Streets, is a two-
record set of new material and 
old lOngs reworked in the 
studio. Melanie'. voice has 
deepened over the years, but 
she retains her di.tinctive 
penchant ' for theatdcal 
phrasing during the perfor-
mance. captured here. Her 
renditions of "Running After 
Love" and Phil Ochs' 
"Miranda" are particularly 
warm and winning. If you 
haven't heard a Melanie 
record in a long time, this is a 
good chance to become 
reacquainted with her 
simpli.tic but charming music.

But instead of fighting a battle 
they have already lost, they 
have adopted a collection of 
arguments that, since they are 
drawn aphoristically in term!> 
of the value of human life, 
seem unassailable; they 
attempt to set the rules of the 
game '0 that anyone who 
argues with them halt to

John Schlesinger should be 
commended for his excellent 
direction-in Yanhs. He make:. 
an act· urate reconstruction of 
a people proud of their 
heritage. and as 11 result. wary 
of any outside influences . In 
the New Year's Eve dan ce 
sequence. Schlesinger offers a 
vivid depiction of the age-old 
prejudices betwem blacks and 
Southern whi tes that were still . 
actively generating at that 
time. The essence of 1943 
England is further captured by 
the musical soundtrack. which 
combines what cou ld be 
considered top 40 tunes of the 
day with original composi tions 
by Richard Rodney Bennett. 

They !>houldn't. Of course 
some form of life, or the 
potential for it, is being 
eliminated in an abortion, just 
alt doctors used to choose the 
baby over the ' mother in 
dangerou, childbirths. People 
face more choices between life 
and death, the most painful of 
which is the choice of whether 
to go to war, than pro-lifer!> 
care to admit. The real battle i!> 
not over when life begin in the 
womb, but over whether pro-
choiceu interested in saving 
women and un~ilnted children 
from unhappy lives - and poor 
people from suffering even 
more becau~ of their poverty-
will win out over pro-lifers 
whose attitudes are often 
based on nothing more than 
nostalgia for an archaic and 
paternalistic social order .
