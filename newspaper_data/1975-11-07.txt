Election 
Night 
Blahs 

by Sara Lowen 
Community Editor 

I have always associated elec-
tion night with crowds of tense 
campaigners, flashing electronic 
tote boards and Eric Sevareid's u~ 
to-the-minute analyses of election 
results. 

Election Central at the Inter-
national Room of the EI Cortez was 
somewhat less glamorous. 

The crowd barely filled the 
International Room and seemed to 
be made up of interested 
bystanders and people seeking 
refuge from the fog, instead of 
hard-core campaigners. There 
was little to remind one that this is 
the electronic age of the in-
stantaneous vote-count. Although 
the results came via telephonics, 
tw o women had the task of 
chalking the figures on a mam-
moth chalk board. 

Even the campaign bunnies, a 
staple of presidential politics, were 
scarce, the closest approximation 
being two pre-teen girls with 
bumper stickers prominently 
displayed on their jeans. 

Soto 
James G. Soto, the Triton Times' 

political pundit, gave d Sevareid-
like analysis of the election. Soto is 
a veteran of Election Central. He 
pointed out the local politicians, 
commenting on their records in 
office and how much they usually 
drink at Election Central. 

Election Central is still a popular 
place for getting drunk on election 
night, even though bars are now 
opened on election day. 

San Diego seems to be a haven 
for short politicians, which is 
surprising, since Time 
magazine tells us that the tallest 
presidential candidate always wins 
the election. But by my un-
confirmed observations, the short 
candidate were the winners in 
Tuesday's election. 

So to also pointed out various 
members of the local media who 
roamed the crowd, looking for 
politicians, or made live broad-
casts from tables set up along the 
!-) ides of the room. Kathy Clark of 
TV8 Action News looked very 
businesslike. John Kern of the 
Evening Tribune and State 

ssemblyman Larry Kapiloft were 
very cordial, joking and slapping 
each other on the back. 

Soto and I had our journalistic 
duties too. Since the Triton Times 
did n't have a press table and a 
hotline to the office, we wrote the 
election story in a lounge upstairs 
Clnd called it in on a pay phone. 

We returned to the International 
Room to find that Mayor Pete 
Wilson - his candidates apparently 
winners - had arrived looking 
rather subdued, considering that 
he was the victor of the evening. In 
his Ivy League suit and 
Rrylcreamed hair, Wilson stood 
holding a bottle d. beer and seemed 
more like a fraternity boy than a 
successful politician. . 

Wilson was skillful though, 
alternately drinking his beer and 
pos ing for pictures with the 
vening's victors. 

The Losers 
Some of the losing candidates 

We,'e still around, perhaps 
ll1i~trustful of the early results. 
The losers miled as their families 
and supporters consoled them. 
The press ignored them. It 's hard 
to La lk to the losers.

Allende Attacks Chile 
Fascisnt in Speech 

by Charles Heimler 
Special Writer 

" After the war, companero, we 
are all generals-" 

Laura Allende, sister of former 
Chilean president Salvador 
Allende, who died during the 1973 
coup ousting his regime, Tuesday 
night recounted the history and 
accomplishments of the Chilean 
self-assertion and its alleged 
subsequent US government-
backed subversion. 

Allende, currently on a speaking 
tour of the US from her exile in 

Mexico, was introduced by Herbert 
Marcuse to an overflow crowd, a 
significant portion of which heard 
the evening's program through 
loudspeakers outside USB 2622. 

The United States has continued 
to aid the junta in Chile, said 
Allende, through the over $2 billion 
in aid administered to Chile 
beginning sooner than one month 
after the coup. 

This aid has been financed in 
part by North American private 
banks, said Allende, and much has 
gone for indemnities to cor-

Rusty Rhodes on JFK: 
The Awful Truth 

by Mark Stadler 
News Editor 

Was Lee Harvey Oswald a CIA agent? Were more than three bullets 
fired when John Kennedy was assassinated? Was there more than one 
gunman? Why were witnesses to a second gunman di~credit~d ? 

Did the United States military establishment conspIre to kill Kennedy? 
Those and many other questions were addressed by Rusty Rhodes 

Tuesday night in the Mandeville Auditorium. 
Using a multi-media show Rhodes, who is th executive director of t.he 

Committee to Investigate Political Assassinations, argued that Ken-
nedy 's alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was working with the Central 
Intelligence Agency from the late fifties through 1~3 . . 

From the beginning of his two-hour presentallon Rhodes hmted at 
military complicity, or direct guilt, in the assassination. . . . 

He pointed out severe conflicts between the Kennedy admlnIstratton 
and the Pentagon over foreign policy. He said that Kennedy ~ou~d 
himself at odds with the military over the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban mISSIle 
crisis, the test ban treaty with the Soviet Union, nuclear superiority and 
Vietnam. 

Rhodes related that Kennedy, in October 1963, drafted an Executive 
Order to withdraw all American soldiers from Vietnam. By the time he 
travelled to Dallas, 1000 troops had already been withdrawn. 

In November, Rhodes said, Kennedy vowed' 'to smash the CIA into 1000 
little pieces." 

3 Shots In 5 1/2 Seconds 
Rhodes suggested that the Warren Commission, which was dominat~d 

by former CIA people and congressional CIA s~pporters, never .in-
vestigated the question "Who kil~~ JFK?" and ~I~ted ~)Ut an amazmg 
series of coincidences, contradIctions and omiSSions In the Warren 

~po~ . 
The commission concluded that Oswald, actmg alone , shot three bullets 

at Kennedy's car, in between 4.8 and 5.6 seconds. 
In trying to duplicate that feat the commission used expert marksmen, 

under much better circumstances than allegedly Oswald had. The 
marksmen could not, Rhodes said. 

During his slide series Rhodes showed pictures of the sixth story 
window Oswald allegedly was at when he shot Kennedy, both 3.5 and 5 
seconds before the shots occurred. The window was empty. 

Eighty seconds after Kennedy had been shot, a Dallas police officer 
saw Oswald on the second floor of the building. The building' levator 
was out of order, and a witness who was walking up the tairca e at the 
moment of the killing said no one passed her going down. 

"Superbullet" 
The Warr n ommission stat d that if the three-bull t theory wa 

disbeli vcd, the entire report wa invalid. Rhodes agre d. 
The report concluded that Oswald's third bullet hit Kennedy in th

GSU Vote Favors 
a-Day Work Stoppage 
Longer Strike 
Planned Later 

by Mark Stadler and 
Ran Anbar 

The Graduate Student Union 
(GSU) has voted overwhelmingly 
in favor of a work stoppage for 
three days in late November and 
an indefinite strike for early winter 
quarter. 

And the Chancellor, contacted 
yesterday, reiterated his 
statement that money is not 
available to satisfy union 
demands, and that TAs who par-
ticipate in an indefinite strike will 
be fired. 

With two-thirds of the union's 400 
members participating over 82 
percent voted on Tuesday and 
Wednesday to hold a work sto~ 
page November 19, 20 and 21. The 
GSU also voted to go on strike 
beginning January 12 for an in-
definite period. 

GSU Negotiating Committee 
member Tom Lewis said yester-
day that the vote is "very en-
couraging." He feels it will lead to 
"a very effective" work stoppage 
and negotiating process. 

Fellow committee member Jim 
Kavanagh said " the ad-
ministration is going to have to 
reconsider our determination and 
strength. 

"The administration has to make 
some decisions about how they' re 
going to approach our demand." 

Kavanagh said " the whole union 
hopes" for fruitful negotitations. 
However, Lewis said that it will 
take "something much more 
substantive than" actions taken by 
McElroy in the past. 

Nothing to Negotiate With 
Yesterday Chancellor McElroy 

again said he could not negotiate. 
"Naturally I'm dissappointed 
because I don 't believe a work 
stoppage is going to solve 
anything. It's particularly un-
fortunate that it affects the quality 
of undergraduate instruction. 

" It is also frustrating to the 
administration since we see no way 

how we can negotiate when we 
hav~ nothing to negoJate with," 
McElroy said. 

The Chancellor says he does not 
see how the conflict is going to be 
resolved. The state is not going to 
give any more funds other than 
those that it is already committed 
to give this year, according to 
McElroy. 

The only other solution in order 
to meet the graduate students' 
demands of 50 percent com-
pensation for all graduate students 
would be to cut back on the nwnber 
of T As, which would only worsen 
the educational process, said 
McElroy. 

" If they go on an indefinite strike 
in the winter quarter the Regents' 
rules are very clear on this : They 
would have to be dropped from the 
payroll and other people hired to 
carry the job," said McElroy. 

The Chancellor said earlier in 
event of a strike, striking teaching 
assistants will be replaced by 
qualified undergraduates and 
volunteers from the community. 

Out of Toucb 
GSU media contact Dan Rosen 

said yesterday that this plan shows 
that " McElroy is definitely out of 
touch with the situation at UCSD." 

He questioned how un-
dergraduates could teach classes 
they had not yet taken. 

Rosen emphasized that, by 
taking these actions, the GSU is 
" not shortchanging un-
dergraduates but working with 
them." 

" In their lack of response to 
graduate students," Rosen said, 
the administration, " is also hur-
ting undergraduates." 

One union organizer said, " I 
think that the administration is 
going to decide now whether it is 
going to make some real 
movement on our demands, or put 
forth concrete alternatives, or 
whether it is going to try to break 
the union." 

At their Nov. 13 meeting, GSU 
members will discuss union af-
filiation and ballots will be 
distributed to vole on that 
possibility.

first, which Rhodes calls "superbullet," first struck JFK, then hit former 
Texas governor John Connelly, leaving a total of seven holes in the two 
men. 

From Oswald's perch on the sixth floor, Rhodes said, it would not have 
been possible for the third bullet to do that. 

From viewing films of the assassination, it was shown that Connelly did 
not react when Kennedy was hit by the first bullet, until 1.8 seconds later. 

Thi bullet, Rhodes said, must have hovered in mid-air for 1.8 seconds, 
"spotted Connelly and said 'Why not?' " 

The Warren Commission i nored all medical e id nce in concluding 
that one buJlet could have done all that, Rhodes said. 

Another Gunman? 
If there were more than three shots, there must have been mor than

Abortion vs. Right-to-Life: More than One View 
We are watching with interest and concern the recent discussion on 

abortion presented by the Triton Times. It is encouraging to see that 
more people are beginning to take a deep look at the morality of abortion 
and we would like to raise the following points for your consideration. 

Many discussions on abortion quickly escalate to bitter arguments in 
which individuals spend more time quibbling over choice of analogies and 
cries of sex.ism than reaching new levels of understanding. To keep 
things straight. we suggest this sequential organization: First. a decision 
on whether or not the fetus is a human being and where in its development 
it has attained that status; and second. a discussion of the implications of 
abortion on the women's rights question. the option of adoption. etc. 
which only makes sense after the initial question is resolved. 

Determination of humanity might be ex.amined under three criteria: 
physiological. psychological. and spiritual. Even a cursory study of 
embryology shows the legal twenty week limit to be arbitrary at best. It 
is disquieting to note that at six weeks. human brain activity of the fetus 
can be recorded on the electroencephalogram. The heart begins to beat 
at 22 days. and perhaps most importantly. at conception. the zygote entity 
is uniquely human (chromosomally). is alive (capable of replacing its 
own dying cells). and needs only time and food to grow to adulthood. 

In concerning ourselves with the psychological realm. we are curious 
about Ms. Weber's choice of the birth experience as the beginning of 
human life. Why not select any number of distinct pre- or postnatal 
categories? Jean Piaget outlines roughly four stages of intellectual 
development and awareness during the years of childhood. Why not 
select the first signs of response to external stimuli (prenata l) or the 'age 
of reason' (approx. age seven)? Because people appear to have amnesia 
of prenatal awareness does not rule out its existence. 

The spiritual question is even more difficult . Where. if not at its 
creation. would the human being acquire its spiritual essence? The 20 
week limit seems incomprehensible. Those who look to the Bible for 
guidance will find passages dealing with prenatal identities and tO,those 
who espouse reincarnation. exclusion of prenatal existence would seem 
inconsistent. 

Given some notion of the fetus' humanity . attention can now focus on 
the implications of abortion. Consideration of the Women's Rights 
question is paramount. We. the authors. openly welcome the advances 
being made by women in their pursuit of self-determination and personal 
dignity. However. we find Debbi Carlin's and Deborah Weber's replies 
(TT Nov. 3. 1975) disheartening. Distinction must be made between 
decisions of moral gravity and personal comfort. We agree that nine 
months of knitting and cramps could get tedious. But. given the 
humanity of the fetus. these arguments are ludicrous. Try taking the life 
of your little brother on the grounds that he's a pain in the neck. Unfor-
tunately. biological realities (women bear children, men don·t) have 
been equated with sexism. They shouldn 't be . Biology is given; morality 
must work from there, 

Should one assume the stance that the fetus does not possess human 
rights, abortion remains an expensive and relatively hazardous option of 
birth control. We are aware that the physical and psychological stress of 
pregnancy is not an easy burden to bear. Still, repeated abortions seem 
extremely imprudent and cruel. especially when one considers that 
prospective foster parents are waiting several years for children to love 
and take care of. Further, should a couple's efforts at conventional birth 
control fail. they must face the fact that the fetus is a living reality . 
Whether or not they consider the fetus to be human at that period of time. 
to abort is a brutal cessation of human potential. both temp ora I and 
divine. 

Allende ...

Allende's elected term of office. 

The junta is currently only 
keeping itself in power through 
force. repression and poverty. 
which. according to the exiled I 
member of the Chilean legislature, 
are at levels unprecedented in the I 
country's history. 

Most Miserable Poverty 
" Worker's rights have been lost. 

The econ'omic system has driven 
them to the most miserable 
poverty." Allenee said. 

She continued "The country has 
been given back to the capitalists. 
I saw an ad in 1:1 Mecurio. Chile's 
largest newspa'Jer, for lands for 
sale. 'Great opportunity tor 
national and frre gn investors.' 
And it mentio:led seven farms 
which under the National Health 
Service were sanitoriums and rest 
places for the wtJrkers." 

Talking to thE! audience through 
an inte rpreter, Allende sa id, " It is 
important to understand the 
process in Chile as it is always 
important to understand and 
recognize facism. It is a great 
danger if p ople remain quiet 
about fascism because I've s en

been wounded by fascism." 
She called for revolutionary 

solidarity and urged students and 
academicians to write letters 
protesting and inquiring about the 
political prisoners held in Chile. 
South America and throughout the 
world. 

" For students and faculty to be 
interested in Chile is to be in-
terested in other oppressed 
countries." she said in the 
beginnings of her speech. and later 
" people who say they support 
sLruggles have to participate in the 
struggles next to the people, And I 
say this because this is what the 
students did in Chile. It ·s not 
enough to say these things in 
seminars, these theories have to be 
put into practice." 

In her carefully reasoned and 
documented discussion of abortion 
problems. your correspondent 
failed to make one point clear. 

It is I.rue · tha t every fertilized 
human egg contains all the genes 
that make up a human being. But 
this is also true of every un-
fertilized egg, too. though they are 
not represented in duplicate as 
they are in the fertilized eggs. 
Unfertilized eggs respire : they 
should have the same right to life 
as fertilized ones. There is no 
Christian dogma known to me 
which asserts the superiority of 
diploids over haploids. Indeed. it 
seems likely that our Lord J~sus

Christ. being born of a Virgin, was 
Himself a haploid (unless he was a

female - for which there is equally 
little evidence ). 

It could be argued that every 
month. by not conceiving. I deprive 
at least one living, breathing 
human egg-cell of the God-given 

potenti~lity to develop into an 
embryo, an infant. a child. an adult 
human being. (And I am here 
setting aside the comparable 
arguments that could. with equal 
merit, be put forward in favc,r. of 
the rights of haploid cells derived 
from male humans_ Think of the 
implications here! )

Continuing: " I also told this to 
the International Woman's Con-
ference in San Francisco. Our 
oppression is not separate from 
men. It is broader and deeper." 

Allende Doctrine 
Allende made clear that it was 

the " Allende doctrine" calling for 
complete nationalization by Chile 
and the possibility of this doc-
trine's being accepted in other 
South American countries that led 
to the big-business-backed CIA 
intervention in Chile. 

The .~ aplt.ahsrs. who have now 
returned to power, have reeked 
billions of dollars out of Chile. said 
Allende. Her brother recognized 
that: the only way for Chile to 
progress would have to be through 
nationalization of industries.

As far as having the experiences of other human beings. it starts out 
just like you and me. by experiencing prenatal life. If it has no emotional 
feelings prenatally. then why is it so horrified to come into the extra-
uterine world? As far as making moral choices. your average two year 
old can't do either. 

When saying abortion was practiced by primitive and nomadic 
societies, and common practice in Rome, if your friend jumps off of a 
cliff, are you going to follow her? 

Then you state that "at times it may be required " and is " subject to the 
forgiveness of God." If it is not a wrong thing to do why does it need 
forgiving? 

Then you go into the question of an individual's vanity and social 
reaction. I belijlve you are straying from the point. but just the same 1 
would tend to doubt that an employer would ask a person to leave just 
because she is pregnant. In the last month or so it might not be practical 
to continue working, and possibly the time might be spent a little more 
profitably than by knitting. 

And you leave the clincher for last : "The fetus is not yet human .... for 
the fact it has not experienced birth. I think that statement is the turning 
point." Are you willing to abort in the middle of the ninth month? 

I have only touched upon some points. Maybe you would like to get 
deeper into the problem. My source is a little comrrion sense.

the direction they thought the shots had come from . 
Spectators lining the sidewalk near KeMedy's car ran up the grassy 

knoll afte r the shooting. apparently for the same reason . 
The Zapruder film - of which Rhodes showed a first copy - a home 

movie of the entire assassination sequence, showed Kennedy's head jerk 
backward, as though he had been shot from ahead, on the grassy knoll 
area . rather than behind. where Oswald was allegedly located. 

The Anti-Cuba Connection 
Rhodes advanced the theory that Oswald was connected with the CIA 

a.nd the anti-Cuba movement then strong in the U.S. 
Oswald had an unusually high security clearance when in the Marines. 

He had taken special CIA Russian language training. He defected to the 
USSR in 1958. After tw~and-a-half years he was allowed to return 
without the usual accompanying diplomatic hassles. ' 

Despite ~s treasonous act. no governmental agency prosecuted 
Oswa ld on hIS return. He was met at the airport by a reported CIA un-
dercover agenL _ ._ _ _ ~ 

Despite his det:ection. he gained the security clearance neces~ry to 
work at a plant In Dallas that specialized in government defense con-
tracts. -

[n 1962. without trouble, he was allowed to travel to Cuba. 
His best friend was a New Orleans man who worked closely with the 

CIA. 
Rhodes suggested that from 1958. when Oswald went to the USSR to 

1963 Oswa~d was work0g with the CIA. He was cast as a pre-Marx·ist. 
Rhodes said, to make him appear to be a communist-sympathizer when 
he was charged with Kennedy's assassination. 

Rhodes raised questions sufficiently serious to cast doubt on the 
~a.rren Commission fiO(j~ng.s. The one assass~n and three bullet theory, 
"hich the Warren ComrmsslOn called the crucLaI point of its report was 
shaken: Possib~e connections between Oswald and the CIA, which 'have 
been hmted at In the recent Senate CIA subcommittee hearings were ~~~ . 
It i~ not necessarily true that a cOlUlection can be made and thus u 

conspiracy uncovered.

a op Tritons in Home Opener

Spolia Editor. 

The 1975-76 .' 'tion of the UC San 

Diego varsity basketball team 
made its home debut before a large 
crowd in the main gym, and both 

Soccer Season Ends 
with t:JSI U Tie 

In a tightly contested, well played soccer match, UC San Diego closed 
its abbreviated soccer season Wednesday at Muir Field by tying USIU, I-
t. 

Both teams had excellent opportunities to score in the closing moments 
of the regular contest and during the two five-minute overtime periods, 
but the deadlock remained appropriately unbroken in this evenly 
matched game. 

the players and fans were treated 
to a show of professional basket-
ball by a touring group of stars 
called Athletes In Action. 
Unfortunately, the Tritons had to 
play in the show, and were torn 
apart, 109-53. 

A group of fonner college or pro 
players, AlA is part of the Campus 
Crusade for Christ. The squad 
spends five months a year, on 
salary , playing some of the 
nation 's larger and smaller 
schools, and doing some preaching 
at halftime. Ranging in age from 
22 to 26, and with seven players at 
6'7" or taller, AlA had little trouble 

ready yet. They haven 't even had 
time to learn the offense yet." 

Even in mid-season form, it's 
doubtful that the Tritons, or any 
other school in the area for that 
matter, could handle AlA. Down 
by 15 after ten minutes and 31 at 
halftime, UCSD was never quite in 
the game. 

-,.,......,...- . puUing away UCSD. 

The AlA cause was headed by 
(onner Univers'ty of Kansas AlI-
American center Dan Knight, who 
at 6'11" , 235, muscled his way to 15 . 
points in 20 minutes of play. 
Forward Rudy Jackson, who 
played for the New York Knicks 
last year, fonner University of 
North Carolina guard Brad Hof-
fman, and ex-Tulsa captain 
Sammy High, with 21 points and 11 
rebounds, were other AlA leaders.

in the Tritons 1-1 tie with USIU . (n Photo: Paul Jarvis) 

USIU, spurred on by the boisteous group of fans they brought to the 
game, scored their lone goal of the match on a first half penalty kick 
following a questionable foul call in front of the UCSD net. For the 
remainder of the first period neither team was able to mount a very 
serious offensive threat. 

In the second half of action, goalie Doug Youngdale, in the nets for only 
his second time this season, kept the Tritons in the game with three 
outstanding saves. A diving one-armed stop, a leaping overhead 
deflection, and a left-legged block of a driving shot from point blank 
range, all saved what looked like sure USIU goa ls and kept UCSD close 
enough to come back. 

The Triton comeback came midway through the final half. Dave 
Youngdale broke free with the ball deep in usru territory and passed off 
to the Tritons leading scorer, Alfonso Gonzales, who just managed to roll 
the ball into the corner of the goal. 

After this score, USIU put on a determined offensive but time and again 
we re halted by a stringent UCSD defense led by ex-goalie now fullback, 
Joe Wettstein , and more fine goal play by Youngdale. 

After regular time had expired. both coaches decided to play two 
overtime periods. despite the descending darkness. Both squads ' goalies 
maintained the tie by coming up with saves made esp cially difficult by 
the lack of daylight.

It was the Tritons first exhibition 
game of the season, after playing 
an informal scrimmage against 
Camp Pendleton last week. 
Loaded with new, talented players, 
UCSD just wasn't ready for such 
stiff competition so soon. 

" We'll never play a game this 
early in the year again," said 
UCSD head coach Barry Cun-
ningham. " The players aren't 

The play of center Gary Nash, 
forward Mark Dobransky, and 
guard Mallory Mitchell kept the 
Tritons breathing for most of the 
game. An in-depth look at the 
entire UCSD team will be 
presented in the Triton Times next 
week.
