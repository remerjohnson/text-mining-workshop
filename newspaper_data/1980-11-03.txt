. Iran willing to release hostage~ 
Parliament sets down four demands for release of caPtive~ 

By -the Associated Press 
The Iranian Parliament, in 

a major step toward ending a 
stalemate that has kept the 
world in crisis for a year, 
voted yesterday to free the 52 
American hostages if the. 
United States meets four 
conditions set down by 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho-
meini and a parliamentary 

committee. 
It was the most promising 

development in the US-
Iranian confrontation in the 
365 days since the seizure of 
the US Embassy in Tehran. 
But the Iranian proposal, 
calling for US concessions on 
complex financial matters, 
was fraught with potential 
difficulties. 

President Carter, at a 
White House news briefing, 
said the Parliament's terms 
"appear to offer a positive 
basis" for negotiating the 
hostages' freedom, but he 
could not predict when that 
might come. He said hi 
administration is pursuing 
the matter through diplomat-
ic channels and any 
resolution of the crisis must 
be in keeping with America's 
honor and vital intere ts. 

"I know that all Americans 
will want their return to be 
on a proper ba is which i 
worthy of the suffering and 
sacrifice the hostages have 
endured." he said. 

The president said any 
solution would have to be in 
"full accord" with the laws 
and the Constitution of the 
United States, a possible 
reference to the complexities 
involved in meetmg the 

Iranian condition . 
Carter also declared that 

Tue day's pre idential 
election will not affect his 
decisions .in re pon e to the 
Parliament' action. 

In New York, United 
Nations Secretary-General 
Kurt Waldheim said there 
was now a better chance than 
ever for resolving the dispute. 
He said he telephoned bot h 
Washington and Tehran and 
offered hi helpin making the 
next tep. 

The Iranians said the 
United States must fulfill all 
of the term - not simply 
signal it acceptance of them. 
Groups of ho tage then 
would be freed in phases a 
each condition is met , they 
said. The Parliament 
appeared to have hardened in 
at lea t one key a pect the 
position et down by 
Khomeini when he listed the 

condition. 
Tehran radio said the 

Parliament's position was 
that "America's procrastin-
ation can prevent their 
relea e and lead to their trial 
as alleged pies." 

Although the language 
approved by the Majlis does 
not mention trial, it does say 
the hostages would be turned 
over to the "judidal system" 
if the conditions were not 
met. When Khomeini first set 
down the conditions Sept. 12, 
US official were encouraged 
by the omi ion of any 
reference to trials. 

American officials yester-
day declined comment on the 
Parliament' refinement. 
aying t hey were awaiting an 

official tran lation of the 
conditions.

Carter stops campaign to

President Carter said 
yesterday evening that new

toward freedom for the 52

will not be swayed by the

Carter's nationally 
televised statement was 
guarded as to the prospects 
for a hostage release. "I wish 
I could predict when the 
ho tages will return," he 
said. "I cannot. 

"But whether our hostages 
come home before or after the 
election, and regardle s ofthe 

, outcome of the election, the 
Iranian government and the 
world community will find 
our country, its people and 
the leaders of both political

early and safe return of the 
hostage ... on a ba is that 
preserves our national honor 
and our national integrity." 

Carter said the terms et 
early Sunday by the Iranian 
Parliament "appear to offer a 
positive ba is" for achieving 
those objective . He did not 
say whet her or not tho e 
terms would be accepted by 
the admini tration. That 
decision was left open, at 
least until election eve. 

"We are within twodaysof 
an important national

me a sure you that my 
decisions on thi crucial 
mat ter will not be affected by

This is a deceptive statistic.

Carter completely swamping

- more on polls they need more 

to rely on polls. The cycle is 
self-perpetuating. 

Results of polls remove the 
necessity for people to decide 
for themselves who should be 
elected (or what the best 
toothpaste is). Poll results fill 
the desire for instant 
gratification: "if I watch the

And how does all this relate 
to John Anderson and his 
being a casualty of personal 
egoism and political 
pragmatism? John Anderson 
- for all his faults (and I'm 
sure he'd readily admit he 
has faults) - is a sure v4ctim 
of the public penchant for 
believing poll results and of 
its "back a winner " 
mentality. 

The polls always seem to 
phrase their question about 
preference for presidential 
candidates in such a way as 
to cast doubt on Anderson's 
ability to win. For example, 
"If John Anderson was a 
serious candidate, would you 
vote for Carter, Reagan, or 
Anderson if the election were 
held tomorrow?'" By 
inserting that phrase "ifJohn 
Anderson was a serious 
candidate", pollsters tell us 
Anderson is not a serious 
candidate. 

Is it any wonder he has 
-done so poorly in the polls? 
Once again the Pygmalion 
effect has been proved: the 
poll·takers (and press) say 
John Anderson is ' not a 
candidate to be taken 
seriously since he can't win 
and. sure enough, he doesn't 
win. "See, we were right all 
along" they say. 

I, for one, would like 
nothing more than to prove 
the polls wrong. Since my 
chances of doing so are 
negligible I can, at least,

to owners of rental

Their mortgage payments 

have stayed at a frozen rate. 
while your rents ha ve

complain about additional

along with the high costs

be too heavy a strain on the

First of all, many seem to 
believe that the implementa'

the opposition suggests. Also, long overdue. 
what about the strain of the 
renter's budgets? Mos t San Diego needs rent relief. 
importantly, the word Students and young people

What I am talking about is 
the notion that one man's

How can this be when 
landlords and realtors are 
constantly speculating and 
assessing values to rental 
property on the basis of 
alr~dy faddishly ·inflated,

plain truth is rents are 
adjusted to make easy large

owners.

important: finding a suitable 
candidate to support for 
President, a man who 
handles issues very far 
removed from our sphere of 
influence, or getting priced 
out of your home, the 
inability to find reasonably· 
priced housing, and direct or 
mdirect harrassment from 
landlords who constantly let 
you know by numerous rules 
that it is their property (even 
though the law says it is your

that's been in our family for 
over four generations. 

Then communism came 
and rent control ' - "to help 
the renter" - was imposed. 
Rents range now from $3 to 
$35 in the majority of East 
Germany . Over a period of 
years landlords could ill 
afford to make any repairs, 
and hou es deteriorated until 
the la.ndlord had little choice 
bUI to turn the home over to 
the government. 

Government now controls 
the housing indust ry -
another freedom lost. Private 
enterprise lost all incentive, 
the only new building was by 
government , and we all know 
how.efficient it is. 

Soon the housing shortage 
was so acute that the 
government forced indivi· 
dual home owners to rent 
portions of their already 
limited living space to other 
persons. My uncle is such a 
case. He was forced to rent to 
a family of seven who were 
"in need." (In need. because 
rent control had killed the 
housing market). For this, 

Otto is reconciled with $11 a 
month , not enough to even 
afford the higher heating bill 
the extra persons create. 
Uncle Otto wants the family 
to move so his own daughter 
can move in. The government 
took it under consideration 
over eight months ago. 

Move out when you're I8? 
Slight chance. Rent control 
has imposed a condition

"The whole thing" could be 

. over in one week. But he said 
it was "physica lly impos· 
ible" for the Americans to be 

freed by Tuesday , Election 
Day. 

The Carter admi nistration 
has indicated a willingness to 
discuss the long·awaited 
Iranian demands. But there 
was no immediate word from 
Washington about whether 
and how the cond itions might 
be met. 

Wh e n news of t h e 
Parl iament's act ion fl ashed 
back to the United States at 
about 4 am, EST yesterday, 
President Carter broke off a 
campaign tour in Chicago 
and flew to Washington, 
where he conferred with Vice 
President Walter Mondale, 
National Security Adviser 
Zbigniew Brezinski and other 
aides at the White House. 

"Until we see the fine print 
or ul'\derstand more clearly 
the fine print, we cannot see 
precisely the limit within 
which we are being asked. to 
act ," Sec'retary of State 
Edmund Muskie said lateron 
ABC's " Issues and An· 
swers." 

The deci sion came as Ir;m 
struggled into the seventh 
week of war with neighbor· 
ing Iraq . The Iranians' 
presumed need for American 
spare parts for their US·made 
military equipment was 
believe to be a major factor in 
their action now on the 
hostage question. 

The Iranian news agency 
Pars said the Parliament, 
wiih 200 of its 228 members 
present for the stormy 
session, voted by a "decisive

According to an unofficial 
Pars tran slation of the 
committee report, Iran is 
demanding that the United 
States: 

- Make a "firm commit· 
ment to avoid all direct or 
indirect political and military 
interferen ce" in Iran' 
affairs. 

- Release an estimated $8 
billion in Iranian government 
a sets in US banks- t hat were 
frozen by Carter's execut ive 
order las t Nov. 14. 

- "Cancel and annul" all 
financial claims against the 
Iranian government in US 
courts . It says the US 
government must guarantee 
thai it, not Iran, will pay any 
damages awarded in uch 
lawsuits . 

- Officially recognize the 
right of the Iranian 
government to the deceas~

. demands that the US 
president "take all legal and

Reagan, 
Clark are 
'heretoday 
BY PETER MORTENSEN 

News Editor 
Republican presidential 

candidate Ronald Reagan and 
Libertarian presidential 
candidate Ed Clark will wind 
their campaigns down in San 
Diego late today, the last day 
to campaign before tomor-
row's general election. 

Reagan will speak to an 
expected large crowd 
gathered in the ]:C. Penoey's 
parking lot in the Fashion 
Valley Shopping Center . 
C lark plans a coc~tail 
reception with supporter at 
the Stardu t Hotel in Hotel 
Circle . 

President Jimmy Carter, 
beleaguered by uncertainty 
surrounding the release of 
the Iranian hostages, may 
stop in Los Angeles today 
during a whirlwind tour of 
the western states. But 
Carter announced yesterday 
that he may suspend hi 
campaign trip to devote his 
full attention to the hostage 
situation. -

Independent presidential 
candidate John Anderson 
made his final California 
appearance Saturday during 
a whistle-stop tour between 
San Jose and San Francisco. 

Reagan's appearance , 
scheduled for 5 pm , will be 
highlighted by entertain-
ment from the Osmond 
Family, Blood Sweat and 
Tears and possibly Bob Hope. 

Clark's receptIon, sched-
u led for 6 pm, wi II be followed 
by a news conference during 
which he will "summarize 
t he issues and his cam-
paign." according to a Clark 
campaign worker.

Iranian 
demand 
continued from page 4 
were frozen by a stroke of 
Carter's pen last November, 
it may be a problem to 
"unfreeze" all of theAl as 
simply, since courts could 

- decide to use them to payoff 
claims by US banks and other 
concerns against the Iranian 
government. 

The Carter administration 
also has no legal power to 
"annul" those lawsuits, as 
demanded in the third 
condition. 

As for the final condition, 
there is little Carter can do to 
directly "transfer" Pahlavi 
wealth to Iran. Again it is a 
matter for the courts. The 
Iranians had previously 
hinted they might be 
satisfied if the United States 
provided information that 
would help them in their 
court act ions to recover the 
Pahlavi money.
