The ChØ CafØ Benefit Blog has 
raised approximately $2,000 toward its 
goal of saving the Che Cafe via benefit 
t-shirt sales. 

The ChØ CafØ currently faces clo-
sure if they fail to raise $12,000 to pay 
off insurance debts. ChØ CafØ enthusi-
asts are utilizing the ChØ CafØ Benefit 
Blog to raise the money necessary to 
make the payment.

The t-shirts made exclusively for 
the Che Cafe by the Hellfish Family 
� a merchandise company for 
Southern California bands � feature 
the hardcore bands Bane, Unbroken 
and Seven Generations. All profits 
from the $13 shirts go directly to the 
ChØ.

The band Bane created the first 
t-shirt design, which was available for 
purchase at the ChØ during Banes 
show on Oct. 24. It is also available 
online at the Hellfish Family website.

[Hellfish] will be printing these 
shirts on demand, so as they are 
ordered, they will be printed, ChØ 
CafØ Benefit Blog founder Jesse 
Kranzler said.

The hardcore bands Unbroken and 
Seven Generations will also be releas-
ing ChØ CafØ Benefit t-shirts for pur-
chase directly from the Hellfish Family. 

I didnt think it was in the DIY 
interest of the ChØ to get corporate 
support, Kranzler said. But I felt this 
would be in the DIY spirit of the ChØ.

The ChØ CafØ Benefit Blog will 
move into the second phase of fund-
raising  the ChØ Benefit Festival 
from Jan. 6 to Jan. 8. The lineup will be 
released on Nov. 15.

All of the bands have agreed 
to play for free, were just covering 
expenses for gas, Kranzler said. For 
the most part, everything is going to 
the ChØ. Were also doing a benefit 
with a [merchandise] company [at the 
event].

A CD is to be released  with 
exclusive ChØ CafØ Benefit tracks  in 
early 2012.

Hopefully, the festival will [raise] 
enough to keep [the ChØ] going, but 
[the Benefit CD] will be a more steady, 
long-lasting form of income for them, 
Kranzler said.

STUDENT DRUGGED AND RAPED 
IN THE VILLAGE LAST WEEKEND
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Contributing Writer

A UCSD student was drugged and 
raped a week ago in The Village East trans-
fer housing area. Police are still investigat-
ing the incident, which occurred Oct. 28.

According to the UCSD Police 
Departments daily report from Oct. 30  
the day the incident was reported  the 
rape likely occurred between 2:11 a.m. 
and 3:18 a.m. on Oct. 28 in The Village 
East Building 1. Neither the victim nor any 
suspects have been identified.

UCSD spokesperson Rex Graham said 
that the department would not make any 
statements regarding the occurrence until 
the investigation progresses further.

As this is an ongoing police investiga-
tion, we are unable to comment on [the 
incident] at this time, Graham said in an 
email. We have no further comment.

Last spring, several similar incidents 
occurred that brought attention to sexual 

violence on campus. On May 20, 2010, an 
unidentified female student escaped an 
attempted kidnapping by a male assailant 
near Geisel Library around 8 p.m. Two 
weeks later, on June 3, an attempted rape 
occurred in the apartments of Earl Warren 
College. In those instances, UCSD Police 
sent out a safety alert to the campus that 
cautioned students against taking short-
cuts across campus. �

UCSDs Sexual Assault & Violence 
Prevention Resource Center launched a 
campaign last year to raise awareness of 
sexual violence and prevention on campus. 
University police also offer the Community 
Service Office Program, a program that 
allows a student to call a community ser-
vice officer to escort him or her around 
campus between sundown and 1 a.m.

The assailants in the incidents from last 
year are still unidentified.

BY NICOLE CHAN AND REBECCA HORWITZ
Associate News Editors

About 50 people surrounded the Silent Tree yesterday, Nov. 9 at noon to protest the UC Board of Regents proposal to raise tuition 16 per-cent a year for four years. Protesters chanted, They say cutback, we 
say fight back, and Its bullshit get off it, schools are not for profit, cuts to 
education, will never lead to liberation, at the march. 

Revelle College freshman Emily Stoffer co-founded the Public Education 
Coalition in September after hearing about the UC Regents proposal to raise 
tuition. The PEC collaborated with other organizations, including the Peoples 
Assembly at UCSD, to organize the Nov. 9 protest.

It doesnt matter if you can personally pay the $22,000, there are lots of 
people that cant and thats not okay, Stoffer said. 

The proposed tuition increases would bring tuition to approximately 
$22,000 by the end of the four-year installment plan. UC President Mark 
Yudof announced Nov. 8 that the proposal to raise tuition will not be voted 
on at next weeks UC Regents meeting. Despite this, Stoffer said Wednesdays 
event was still important.

There will be cuts in services here, Stoffer said. The general experience 
at UCSD is going to dwindle. This affects every student and professor and 
everyone here on campus.

Instead of raising tuition next year, Yudof plans to ask for additional fund-
ing from the state, according to UC to seek state funds to avoid a tuition hike 
next year, published Nov. 9 in the Los Angeles Times.

Even though the plan to raise tuition isnt going to be voted on anymore,

CLOSED QUARTERS By Kat Truong

BY JAVIER ARMSTRONG
Staff Writer

Scientists at the Scripps Institute 
of Oceanography have discovered 
giant single-celled amoebas known as 
xenophyophores six miles deep in the 
Mariana Trench, the ocean’s deepest 
known region.

In a July 2011 expedition led by 
Scripps researchers and National 
Geographic engineers, researchers 
arrived at Pacific Ocean’s Mariana 
Trench, located in the Western Pacific, 
and deployed remote-controlled land-
ers called “dropcams.” 

Equipped with HD cameras and 
lights, the team explored a region of 
the trench known as the Siren Deep, 
6.6 miles below the surface of the 
ocean. There, researchers found sin-
gle-celled amoebas known as xeno-
phyophores. The organisms can reach 
four inches in length.

While there are other single-celled 
organisms on earth, most are micro-
scopic and are therefore classified as 
microorganisms. However some are 
visible to the naked eye, such as bac-

teria.  Xenophyophores are the largest 
known single-celled species.

“[They’re] multi-nuclei, mean-
ing they have many nuclei, with no 
membranes between them,” UCSD 
professor of biological oceanography 
and director of the Center for Marine 
Biodiversity and Conservation Lisa 
Levin said. 

Levin said that there are trends 
among some organisms to get larger in 
the deep sea than in shallow water for 
unknown reasons. These xenophyo-
phores are consistent with that trend.

Previous xenophyophores were 
known to live 7,500 meters below the 
surface of the ocean.

According to Doug Bartlett, the 
Scripps marine microbiologist who 
organized the Mariana Trench expe-
dition, this discovery in the deep-
est marine environments is of great 
importance to the field of studies in 
biodiversity, biotechnological poten-
tial and extreme environment adapta-
tion. 

“Although it is part of Earth, the 
trench environment, the darkness, 
high pressure and low temperatures 

seems more like one of Jupiter’s moons 
[like] Europa,” Bartlett said. “We can 
learn a lot about how life can evolve to 
such as bizarre set of conditions.”

The xenophyophores — which 
resemble sponges or cauliflower coral 
— are exclusive to the deep sea, and 
according to Bartlett it is only the tip of 
the deep-sea ecosystem iceberg.

The extreme ocean depths of the 
expedition presented new challenges 
for National Geographic engineers 
who developed the instruments to 
spot the mysterious giant amoebas.

The dropcams were developed and 
used by National Geographic Society 
Remote Imaging engineers Eric 
Berkenpas and Graham Wilhelm. 

“The dropcams are versatile auton-
omous underwater cameras contain-
ing an HD camera and lighting inside 
a glass bubble,” Berkenpas said in the 
Scripps News article “Researchers 
Identify Mysterious Life Forms in the 
Extreme Deep Sea” published on Oct. 
21. “They were created to allow scien-
tists and filmmakers to capture high-
quality footage from any depth.”     

The gathered photographs and 

video of the xenophyophores were 
positively identified by Levin and con-
firmed by Andrew Gooday of the UK 
National Oceanography Center.

CORRECTIONS
On Oct. 23, a article titled 
“Students Participate in Occupy 
UCSD,” incorrectly said Samer 
Naji was the AVP of External 
Affairs. He is the Vice President 
of External Affairs.  On Nov. 3, 
the column “New Business” incor-
rectly stated that an impeachment 
failed with a 17-9-9 vote. The vote 
was 17-9-1.

ing tuition and fees and won’t be able 
to take it much longer.”

According to Sixth College 
junior and protest coordinator Sean 
Estelle, the potential fee increase 
would raise tuition to $22,068 at 
the end of the four years — a 200 
percent fee increase over the last 
decade.  

“It used to be $50,000 to go to 
USC — one of the most expensive 
private colleges in the nation — 
public school might reach half that,” 
Estelle said. “It should never reach 
half that — it should never even 
reach a tenth of that. [Education] is 
for the people, people aren’t going to 
be able to afford that. Education is a 
right for everyone.”

San Diego Faculty Association 
President and UCSD sociology 
professor Ivan Evans spoke at the 
protest. He said students need 
to be released from debt and all 
Californians should defend students 
and teachers from UCs, California 
State Universities and California 
Community Colleges.

“This is a policy that is really 
awful and insupportable,” Evans 
said.

By the time the march started, 
more than 50 people had gathered. 
There were pre-made signs for 
everyone and free red bracelets. The 
protestors marched from Silent Tree 
down to PC Plaza and stopped right 
in front of the crosswalk at Gilman 
Dr.

The protestors walked in cir-
cles on the crosswalk to keep it 
blocked while screaming “Occupy 
Crosswalk.”

Graduate Student in Ethnic 
Studies Alborz Ghandehari and Vice 
President of External Affairs Samer 
Naji led the protestors, encouraging 
them to continue walking. 

They marched on the crosswalk 
for 30 minutes. They stopped traffic, 

including shuttles and buses with 
students trying to get to class. The 30 
bus was one of the vehicles stopped 
— frustrated students walked off the 
bus after five minutes. 

Around 20 protestors stayed on 
the end of Library Walk, holding 
their signs. 

The protestors let the shuttle 
through after occupying the street 
for 15 minutes on the crosswalk, but 
quickly retook the street once the 
shuttle had left.

The police arrived halfway 
through Occupy Crosswalk. The 
officers tried to block the students 
from the street to let the traffic 
through. One officer pleaded with 
the protestors to stay away from the 
street. 

The students broke past the 
police, and Police Chief Orville King 
pulled a female student away from 
the street because a car tried to get 
around the protestors. Graduate stu-
dent in sociology Aaron Marquette 
challenged King in response to his 
action.

“You assaulted that woman,” 
Marquette said. 

The protestors marched back to 
the Silent Tree after 30 minutes of 
occupying the crosswalk. They dis-
cussed the police interfering with 
their occupation of the crosswalk. 
The megaphone was passed around 
the circle so anyone could have a say.

“If they need to get to class tell 
the students to get the fuck off the 
bus,” Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Jack Beegah said.

Beegah was not alone in his sen-
timents. Muir College sophomore 
Adam Netanel said there should not 
have been an issue with obstructing 
the roadway. 

“Blocking traffic is not a civil 
disobedience,” Netanel said to the 
crowd.

After the protest, Police Chief 
Orville King and Police Captain 
David Rose talked to lingering pro-

testors who were upset about police 
interference. King was asked mul-
tiple times about pushing protestors 
back, and he was adamant that he 
did not assault anyone.

“I wouldn’t say I pushed you,” 
King said. “The issue is safety.”

Rose told the remaining crowd 
that they were not allowed to block 
the roadway. He said the police 
could have formed a barrier for the 
protestors, but in that situation, the 
police would have shut down the 
protest.

“We don’t want cars hitting you,” 
Rose said. “Cars are the wild card.” 

Naji said the large turnout was 
good because it meant students 
knew about it and were interested in 
learning more.

“A lot of the people who joined us 
were students who saw us marching 
towards the intersection,” Naji said. 
“Just marching alone doesn’t accom-
plish, civil disobedience is what’s 
needed to get students to come out.”

Naji said the students who joined 
the protest now have a new sense of 
empowerment. 

“We got our message heard by 
shutting down the streets,” Naji said. 
“We accomplished that phenome-
nally today.”

According to Marshall College 
senior and protest co-organizer Iris 
Loughran, Wednesday’s rally was a 
statewide event.

“The main goal of the protest is 
to share solidarity with the whole 
statewide movement because this is 
affecting all of us equally,” Loughran 
said. “No UC is feeling it more than 
other UCs.”

Faculty at CSUs and CCCs are 
going on strike Nov. 17. 

The UCSD Police Department 
could not be reached for comment as 
of press time.

After a tense failure to impeach 
Marshall Senator Summer Perez 
last week, this week’s meeting began 
with an equally tense air when two 
Marshall councilmembers expressed 
their disappointment with the out-
come.

“For a while, 
I was not even 
aware that there 
was a second sen-
ator,” Co-chair of 
Marshall Student 
C o m m i t t e e 
C h e l s e a 
Herrmann said. “My voice is not 
being heard, and that shows a lack of 
concern for her constituents.”

Attendance issues are not just 
about following rules, according 
to Vice-chair of Marshall Student 
Committee Prianna Nelson.

“Even as a highly-involved student 
in the Marshall Committee, my voice 
is only heard through my senators. 
The purpose of a senator is to rep-
resent our voice,” she said. “I find it 
inexcusable to ignore the rules you 
put in place.”

After two special presentations, 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Lynne Swerhone need-
ed to leave the meeting. On her way 
out, she was nearly tackled by Vice 
President of Student Life Meredith 
Madnick and a bright blue glittery 
sash.

“I know she needs to go, but I 
wanted to make sure she was rec-
ognized by council as the Council 
Member of the Week before she left,” 
Madnick said. “I’m sure she appreci-
ates the recognition… and the harass-
ment.”

Vice President of External Affairs 
Samer Naji was pleased with the pro-
test on Nov. 9 against tuition increases.

“We had our voices heard and let 

them know we are not okay with 
tuition increases,” he said. Indeed, 
everyone trying to study in Center 
Hall heard protesters’ voices.

A.S. President Alyssa Wing went 
on a recruitment campaign for coun-

cilmembers to star 
in A.S. Council 
commercials for 
Triton TV.

“I know 
we have some 
Hollywood stars 
in here, so please 
sign up,” Wing 

encouraged. Are you ready for your 
close-ups, ladies and gentlemen?”

Engineering Senator Parminder 
Sandhu put forth an apparently con-
troversial budget for the new engi-
neering event “Engineering-on-a-
stick.” This event will feature free hot-
dogs on a stick and cheese on a stick 
catered by Hot Dog on a Stick.

While it is an event centered on 
engineers, it will be open to all stu-
dents, and Sandhu has even planned 
advertising.

“You are going to love this flier,” 
he said.

However, many councilmembers 
were disappointed in the event’s lack 
of planning.

“I like this event and it has a lot of 
potential, but we need to add more 
substance, if I’m going to be frank,” 
Wing said. I’m sure the pun was 
intended.

In the end, the budget was passed. 
We are all anxiously awaiting the 
unveiling of the event’s flier.

Since the Campus Affairs 
Committee did not pass the motion 
to excuse one of Perez’s absences, the 
meeting was then closed to revisit 
her impeachment. This time, the 
impeachment passed with a vote of 
26-4-1.

Locked Away
Federal financial aid will now be revoked from students who can’t maintain at least 

a 2.0, giving them little time to recover from a bad quarter.

The U.S. Department of Energy released a report last week that world emissions of carbon 
dioxide jumped 6 percent in 2010 — a 
figure far worse than what climate 
scientists predicted four years ago. 
And half of the increase is attribut-
able to China and the United States. 
Despite all of this, President Obama 

halted the Environmental Protection 
Agency’s efforts to regulate air quality 
in September, succumbing to a belief 
that regulations would kill jobs.

95 percent of active climate 
researchers agree that humans are 
contributing to global warming, yet 
free market fundamentalists continue 
to deny our responsibility. Last month, 
former global warming skeptic Dr. 
Richard Muller released a comprehen-
sive report, partially funded by fervent 
deniers, that confirmed previous find-
ings that global warming is real.

If we continue to debate this issue, 
we may as well reopen the debate on 
whether the Earth is round. Far from 
being based in skepticism, denials of 
anthropogenic global warming are 
rooted in sycophancy to the energy 
industry. Exxon-Mobil alone donated 
over 1 million dollars to Republican 
candidates in 2010.

Relying on reports from energy 
companies, Republicans like Rep. Joe 
Barton (R-Texas) argue that the EPA’s 
regulations will kill jobs. Yes, it would 
kill jobs. That’s the point. It would kill 
jobs at coal plants, but open new ones 
at natural gas plants. Manufacturers 
of pollution-control devices would 
thrive. Construction investments 
would create 1.5 million jobs, accord-
ing to a UMass Amherst study.

The United States must remain 
committed to promoting clean energy 
if we are to leave a prosperous nation 
to our grandchildren. Naysayers will 
point to Solyndra as an example of 
government failure, yet Solyndra 
represents only 1.3 percent of an oth-
erwise prosperous portfolio of clean 
energy companies that received loans.

More money needs to be spent 
on research and development. While 
the industry average overall amounts 
to 3.5 percent of revenues spent on 
research, the energy industry spends 
only 0.1 percent, according to the 
American Energy Innovation Council. 
Further, the government spends only 
about $3 billion on energy research 
while defense research receives a stag-
gering $77 billion. Neither the market 
nor the government is sufficiently 
spending money to innovate and cre-
ate green technologies.

Though cap-and-trade foundered 
last year, the federal government 
should consider implementing a 
carbon tax. Lest anti-tax advocates 
shudder in their seats, the tax should 
follow Australia’s model, where the 
bulk of the tax proceeds allowed 
millions of Australians to have their 
income taxes reduced. An alternative 
to this, endorsed by some Republicans 
and Al Gore, is to cut payroll taxes in 
response to the carbon tax.

Care for the environment should 
not be sacrificed on the altar of jobs.

While we were all away this summer, the U.S. Department of Education enacted a big change to federal financial aid: Effective 
since July, any student who does not maintain a 2.0 
GPA while taking at least 36 units per year will be 
ineligible for federal financial aid such as Pell Grants 
and federal loans. Though the policy’s creators have 
tempered it with exceptions for approved part-time 
students and loopholes to account for “special circum-
stances,” the regulation still adds financial pressure to 
academic stress and heaps insult upon injury.

This new “Satisfactory Academic Progress” guide-
line replaces the university’s long-standing policy of 
“academic probation” and stipulates that students who 
do not meet their university’s minimum academic 
requirements (the aforementioned 2.0 and 36-unit 
benchmarks) cannot receive aid for the next aca-
demic year. Under academic probation, students with 
a cumulative GPA between 1.5 and 2.0 had a grace 
period of two quarters in which to bring their GPA up; 
continued under performance, after to quarters, lead to 
“academic disqualification” (read: kicked out).

It may seem like the new law has little effect, given 
that students with sub-2.0 GPAs are in danger of being 
ineligible to even attend university. But the difference 
lies in the fact that, under the more forgiving academic 
probation, students had time to recuperate from a bad 

quarter and raise their overall GPA until they were out 
of danger, all while receiving aid. Now, students who 
can’t pull their grades up enough by the following Fall 
Quarter will no longer be able to receive aid, even if 
their academic record is moving in the right direction. 

Secretary of State Arne Duncan says that these new 
guidelines are to ensure that only “eligible” students 
receive federal funds to complete their education. In 
light of the continuing downslide of education fund-
ing and national debt, it makes sense that Duncan and 
other members of the Department of Education want 
to ensure that the money is going to those who are 
making every effort to succeed academically and grad-
uate on time (and then help the economy, of course), 
instead of the sixth-year who’s slacking in his classes. 

But in a fiscal climate where students are already 
struggling to pay for state schools, and when over 
13,000 students in the UC system alone are receiving 
need-based financial aid, these guidelines ignore that 
federal aid is often the only way students can receive 
a university education, and create a slippery slope by 
ignoring all the reasons students may fail to make 
the 2.0 cut. Thankfully, there’s an appeal process, and 
students will be able to use summer classes to bring up 
their GPAs in time to become re-eligible by fall. But 
the only summer classes that apply for this are those

The bullet train: A $98-billion project founded on the fan-tasy that Californians could 
zip through the state in no time, and 
for less money than a plane ticket.

But since the project’s approval, 
the high-speed rail has been awash 
with criticism to the expected costs 
and toll on communities, not to 
mention derailed from its original 
completion date of 2020 by 13 years, 
with a new expected completion date 
of 2033. So, in an attempt to start 
fresh, the California High-Speed 
Rail Authority released a revised ver-
sion of its business plan on Nov. 1, 
addressing some criticisms and con-
firming others.

Let’s start with the good. The 
revised plan will adopt a “blended 
approach” to construction in Silicon 
Valley, using existing rail lines to 
bring riders to the train’s San Jose 
starting point, rather than building 
a new rail that might ruin homes, 
farms and businesses essential to the 
livelihood of the local communities.

But here’s the bad: After complet-
ing rigorous analysis of ridership and 
long-term costs, the price tag of the 

rail — the largest infrastructure proj-
ect in the nation — has doubled due 
to projected higher project costs and 
inflation. What was once anticipated 
by the rail authority in 2006 to be a 
$45-billion project has now increased 
to $98.1 billion — and that doesn’t 
include promised links to San Diego 
and Sacramento, nor a connection to 
San Francisco. 

It would then be impossible for a 
UCSD student to ride home to San 
Francisco for Thanksgiving — that 
is, without riding up to LA first and 
taking other public transit from San 
Jose into San Francisco at the end 
of the line. So without several major 
cities included in the rail system — 
including our own — there are virtu-
ally no benefits of the train to a large 
portion of the state’s population. 
Plus, based on past cost estimates, 
including San Diego and Sacramento 
would bring the total cost to $115 
billion or more. Therein lies the 
tricky part: Where the hell the High-
Speed Rail Authority is going to 
come up with that money.

According to the plan, the High-
Speed Rail Authority hopes about 

half the funding for the Los Angeles 
to San Jose portion would come 
from a bill now before Congress that 
would expand an existing tax-credit 
program, while the other half would 
come from private investments. 

Basically, the High-Speed Rail 
Authority requires a giant federal 
subsidy to even put a dent in the 
project, and considering the Obama 
administration and congressional 
leadership in both parties are com-
mitted to cutting down on federal 
spending in the coming years, the 
help seems unlikely.

But for those itching to travel up 
and down Central Valley (no one), 
there’s almost enough money. By 
combining some of the $9.95 billion 
in bond seed money provided by the 
passage of Proposition 1A in 2008 
and already-promised federal grants, 
the rail authority is $2.7 billion shy 
of funding the 130-mile Central 
Valley segment. If they made up for 
the difference in more bond sales, 
the interest would rise to $300,000 a 
year — three times the amount of the 
state’s park budget. 

And with no money to continue 

after the middle segment is com-
pleted and a cost two times greater 
than initially proposed, it’s doubtful 
voters will be as supportive as they 
were when they voted three years 
ago, especially when other programs 
— like education — are receiving cut 
after cut.

Appeals Process for Aid Could Leave Students Out

THE MENTAL FISHBOWL By Alex Nguyen LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
From Nov. 15 to Nov. 17, the UC 

Board of Regents and CSU Board 
of Trustees will meet to discuss 
the proposed $2.5 billion cuts and 
tuition hikes of up to 81% 
over the next four years. Brothers 
and sisters, the privatization of 
public education is not only an 
attack on students but an 
attack on public employees, through 
the privatization of the pension 
fund, the rising cost of benefits for 
workers and the restructuring 
of our universities following the 
corporate model. Privatization 
increases the number of high-paid 
administration and management 
positions and cuts staffing and fac-
ulty positions.

In order to reverse this process of 
privatization, the Public Education 
Coalition has organized a week 
of mass action on our campus in 
solidarity with statewide protests to 
fight back against the 
budget cuts:

Monday, Nov. 7 @ Noon: 
Open Mic/Speak-Out Circles 
Library Walk. Come make your 
voice heard! This is an opportunity 
to talk about how the budget cuts 
have affected you, your friends 
and those around you. Anyone is 
encouraged to come and share with 
their grievances with others!

SSB Room 101 @ 7 p.m.: 
Outreach/Planning Meeting. Join 
students and community members 
to organize for public education and 
social and economic justice!

Tuesday, Nov. 8 @ Noon 
The Death of Public Education 
Performance Library Walk. We will 
be hosting a performance from 
12-12:30 p.m. Come dressed in 

black, with an object representing 
your failed dreams for after college. 
Be prepared to DIE at 12:30 p.m. 

Wednesday, Nov. 9 @ Noon: 
Teach-Out and Rally at Library 
Walk! Library Walk. The time has 
come. We warned the UC Regents: 
Turn the cuts around or we’ll shut 
this shit down.

At noon, LEAVE classes. 
Encourage your friends and profes-
sors to do the same. Tell everyone 
you know. Stop a stranger and con-
vince them to join you. We WILL 
come together and make our voices 
heard all afternoon long.

Monday, Nov. 16: Bus trip from 
San Diego to Long Beach for a 
joint CSU/UC protest for public 
education. To reserve a seat on the 
bus: sandiego@uaw2865.org

Spread this to everyone. If not us, 
then who? If not now, then when?

We are committed to uniting 
with people and movements in all 
sectors of society who share our 
commitment to the empowerment 
of workers, students and the unem-
ployed to create an equitable and 
compassionate society.

Education is a human right! 
Through collective struggle, another 
university is possible!

We can take a first step out of 
this crisis by expanding affordable 
and equitable public education in 
California.

taken at a UC campus, which is a financial burden for 
many students compared to community college classes, 
and the path to an appeal is lined with bureaucratic 
obstacles, including “documentation” of hardship and 
stipulations on how often one can appeal. In addition, 
many students suffer from circumstances that are not dire 
enough to merit an appeal, yet not minor enough to be 
brushed off. It’s the coeds dependent on need-based finan-
cial aid are also often the ones working jobs to compensate 
for the rest of the costs, which leads to a scenario that 
can adversely affect academics. But as this scenario has 
become the norm for so many students, these particular 
circumstances won’t stand up under appeal. 

In addition to placing greater burden on students, the 
new pressure pushes universities even further into the role 
of degree-granters instead of institutions of learning. The 

coed who’s nervously eyeing that GPA is going to choose 
the easy A each time over the class that’s reputed to be dif-
ficult but life-changing. And while this is nothing new to 
the crowd that aspires to grad school, there’s an unpleasant 
sense of weight when the consequence of a bad GPA isn’t 
just lowered hopes for Ivy League status, but being stripped 
of the funding to attend university in the first place.

Of course, GPA requirements are nothing new. Private 
and merit-based scholarships have always been liberty 
to have minimum requirements, but federal, need-based 
initiatives should focus on supporting as many students 
as possible. The students who receive financial aid such as 
Pell Grants are already the ones with less-than-ideal cir-
cumstances, the ones most likely to already be working, to 
be struggling with problems their more affluent classmates 
aren’t facing. By placing more burden on the ones who 
already need the most help, the new guidelines puts the 
most vulnerable students at the greatest disadvantage.

ProtestÊ
TunesÊ
TheyÊAreÊaÊ
ChanginÕ

S ince Occupy Wall Street began on Sept. 17, there’s been a lot of yell-ing — but, sadly, not much singing. 
Though the protest and all its subse-
quent nationwide occupations began 
over 50 days ago, there has yet to be a 

single significant protest song like the 
anthems that shook the movements of 
the ’60s.

This upsets me, especially because 
I’ve spent a lot of time listening to 
protest songs completely inapplicable 
to the issues of my generation. Take 
Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are a 
Changin’,” an anthem for the anti-estab-
lishment of the 1960s. Or “A Change 
Is Gonna Come,” Sam Cooke’s contri-
bution to the civil rights movement. 
Or “London Calling,” Joe Strummer’s 
vision of an apocalyptic future, spurred 
by the paranoia of the Cold War.

Sure, everyone can relate to issues of 
race, poverty and war. But these songs 
were also written out of a specific time 
that our generation can never replicate. 
We have no Vietnam, no civil rights 
movement, no Berlin Wall.

Our generation is, as they say, 
“Generation Me.” We’re angry that 
our parents’ promises that we can be 
anything we want to be cannot, and 
will not, come true. We once thought 
we had total control of our destinies, 
and now we know only a small percent 
(the 1 percent, to be exact) hold the 
power. Our struggle is an entirely dif-
ferent kind of struggle from the kind 
that’s been seen before — and it’s a 
struggle that desperately needs its own 
soundtrack.

So when I went to Occupy San 
Diego last month, I listened for the 
protest song that might come out of the 
movement that is definitively ours.

But I heard nothing.
There were drums as we walked 

through the Gaslamp chanting, “We are 
the 99 percent!” I heard a few guitars 
strumming in the camp. And I’m sure 
some people were grumbling the words 
to “Fuck Tha Police” as the threat of 
arrest grew.

But I didn’t hear a real song until 
the clock drew close to midnight — the 
time the police had threatened to arrest 
people if they didn’t move their tents 
from Civic Center Plaza. The protes-
tors made a circle of tents and filled 
them with those who were willing to be 
arrested for the cause. Another circle of 
people linking arms surrounded them, 
followed by a mixed crowd of dubious 
folk (me) who wanted to have an easy 
escape if the police did in fact show up. 
(They didn’t until the following morn-
ing.)

In the midst of this tent cluster, there 
was one dirty hipster clumsily strum-
ming his guitar and repeating the cho-
rus — and only the chorus — to “Let It 
Be.” I kept waiting for him to pick it up 
and sing, “And when the broken hearted 
people living in the world agree/there will 
be an answer/let it be.” But instead he’d 
pause, inhale some more marijuana and 
then start all over again with “Let it be, 
let it be, let it be, oh let it be.”

Which is, ironically, exactly what the Occupy movement 
doesn’t want, making it all the more obvious that we need some 
songs of our own.

Musicians have visited the protests — Tom Morello of Rage 
Against the Machine dropped by, and David Crosby and Graham 
Nash (sans Stills and Young) played for Occupy Wall Street — 
but as relics from previous decades, none have encapsulated the 
unique frustration at the core of the movement.

See, there’s a thing all those classic protest songs have in com-
mon: The artists who wrote them were the young people in the 
frontlines — not the figures of a generation past.

Unfortunately for us, we’ve heard our parents’ music our entire 
lives, making it hard to follow up the passion they sang about. 
So, cheesy as it sounds, I guess now it’s our turn to write our own 
songs. 

I don’t want something rooted in a specific anger (the Bush-
bashing of Green Day’s “American Idiot,” for example), or 
clouded by oversized personas (Kanye West and Jay-Z’s “Made 
In America”). I want something transcendent. Something that’d 
make Bob Dylan proud. 

So I’m looking at you Bon Iver, Arcade Fire — hell, even Lady 
Gaga. Let’s one-up the hippies.

ALBUM REVIEW

A fter establishing him-self, perhaps uninten-tionally, as hip-hop’s 
Canadian nice guy, Drake has 
officially had enough. On his 
sophomore release Take Care 

he poses as slightly more p.c. 
Weezy, consequently allow-
ing his emotive delivery and 
refreshingly earnest lyricism 
to fall by the wayside.

Dance floor grind jam 
“We’ll Be Fine,” for example, 
incorporates a spacey pro-
duction of a whisper loop 
with heavy bass and a quiet 
synth oscillation. But the 
track then takes a drastic turn 
lyrically, focusing unconvinc-
ingly on Drake’s own “gangsta 
shit” — which comes off as 
foolish more than intimidat-
ing.

The rapper then aims 
for the hipster crowd with 
the title track. On “Take 
Care,” the xx’s beat master 
Jamie Smith creates a moody 
soundscape of swaying gui-
tars and steel drum rhythms. 
Featuring a strangely emo-
tionless Rihanna, the cleanly 
produced dance track chugs 
along with Smith interjecting 
vocal samples that, though 
interesting, clash with the 
vocalists’ lazy delivery.

Most frustrating, however, 
are Take Care’s consistent 
reminders of Drake’s unreal-

ized potential. Album high-
light “Lord Knows” layers 
warped choir samples over 
a Stewart Copeland-style 
backbeat, as Drake spits some 
of his rawest verses to date. 
Finally waking up and taking 
some risks, Drake flaunts his 
seamless flow and songwrit-
ing ability, leaving us wishing 
he’d muster the confidence to 
embrace the boundary-push-
ing dweeb of breakthrough 
Thank Me Later.

Canadian emo-rap hearthrob channels bad-boy roots.
In New Clothes

Afew minutes into Lars Von Trier’s latest operatic psycho-drama “Melancholia,” Earth is 
destroyed. Echoing the prologue of 2009’s 
cathartically disturbing “Antichrist,” Von 
Trier again opens with an extreme slow-
mo montage set to classical score. This 
time around: beautifully composed sur-
realistic images 
of the film’s 
somber female 
leads and a 
mysterious blue 
planet’s apoca-
lyptic collision 
with our own.  

So often fodder for every summer’s 
obligatory disaster-flick-with-half-baked-
environmentalist-message, “Melancholia” 
instead reduces human annihilation to 
a simple metaphor for Von Trier’s own 
chronic depression. 

Coming from the guy who was 
recently banished from the Cannes Film 
Festival for jokingly sympathizing with 
Nazis, the arrogance seems fitting of his 
tortured-artist persona. But — as any fan 
of the Danish auteur will attest — it is 
only a persona, and Von Trier’s struggle 
with depression has always been either 
the inspiration or thematic focus for 
his darkly groundbreaking films. In 
“Melancholia,” he embraces it in full. 

Fittingly, part one of the film takes 
place during the bleakest wedding in 
cinematic history. Justine, the bride 
(a strangely catatonic Kristen Dunst), 
wanders in and out of the reception in 
a morose trance, leaving her increas-
ingly anxious sister Claire (Charlotte 
Gainsbourg) and Claire’s husband John 
(Kiefer Sutherland) to placate her out-
rageously pissed off mother (Charlotte 
Rampling), sleaze-bag father (John Hurt) 
and manipulative, business-minded boss 
(Stellan Skarsgård). But the chaos doesn’t 

seem to bother Justine as much as the 
foreboding blue star — the oh-so-subtly 
named planet Melancholia, we later learn 
— with which she’s become transfixed.

The mixed bag of animated char-
acters, shot on Von Trier’s trademark 
frenzied hand-held, finds the director 
inching closest to dark comedy as he’s 
been since 1998’s “The Idiots.” Justine’s 
deadpan interactions with a company 
newbie (Brady Corbet) even provide a 
small glimmer of comic relief amid the 
first act’s draining despair.

But darkness quickly falls upon the 
decidedly more dramatic part two, as 
planet Melancholia slowly approaches 
John and Claire’s manor — now unoc-
cupied by the clamorous wedding 
guests. Justine’s dread is now replaced 
with numb acceptance — a testament to 
Dunst, who won the Best Actress award 
at Cannes for her performance — as she 
supernaturally becomes aware of her 
mounting fate. The real star, however, is 
Sutherland, whose tightly-wound John 
delivers a haunting parable of the over-
logical in the face of uncertainty. 

As expected, “Melancholia” abounds 

with stunning cinematography and 
dynamic singular images. A scene in 
which Claire spies Justine lying on a 
stream bank in the middle of the night — 
her fragile, nude body eerily illuminated 
by the now-giant Melancholia’s terrifying 
beauty — is remarkable, as are the (liter-
ally) explosive final minutes of the film. 

But linked only by dreary faux-doc 
footage of the cheerless heroines trudging 
around the massive home, these spectac-
ular moments often prove too little, too 
late. It’s easy to wish Von Trier would just 
pop a few uppers and delve deeper into 
his emergent Gothic-Romantic kick, giv-
ing Tim Burton a final nail in the coffin. 

Von Trier is far too serious for that, 
though — which is, consequently, what 
makes his work so stubbornly unique. 
And while “Melancholia” is far from the 
director’s most provocative (no genital 
mutilation or Bjork-led musical num-
bers) and, by no sane person’s standards, 
an enjoyable experience, the film has 
enough gorgeous images and interest-
ing ideas to keep us readily awaiting his 
upcoming and more promisingly-titled 
“The Nymphomaniac.”

MEN’S TENNIS — This weekend, the UCSD men’s 
and women’s tennis teams headed to the 55th Southern 
California Intercollegiate Championships at the Los 
Angeles Tennis Center, located on the UCLA campus. 

Last Wednesday through Sunday, Nov. 2 to Nov. 6, the 
Tritons competed against Division I competition at the 
SoCal Tournament.

On Sunday, the last day of competition, UCSD senior 
Chapman Chan, junior Austin West and sophomore 
Devon Sousa all fought their way through the ranks of 
Division I athletes to reach the singles main draw of the 
tournament. 

Sousa had perhaps the most commanding performance 
against David Doehring of BYU, winning the match in just 
two sets with scores 6-4 and 6-2.

West also had a good showing, performing with a level 
head after falling behind in the first game 2-6 against UC 
Santa Barbara’s Alex Johnson. West came back 7-6 in game 
two and won the tie-breaker with an impressive score of 
10-2.

Chan, West and Sousa all made it to the draw. They 
joined teammates senior Sam Ling and junior Junya 
Yoshida, two Tritons ranked high enough to have had a 
bye to the main draw. 

However, no Tritons made it past their first match 
in the main draw. While Sousa had a good match 
against Doehring, when he faced No. 1-seeded Yannick 
Hanfmann of USC, he was handed disappointment to the 
tune of 6-2 and 6-1. 

On the doubles side, the Tritons fared little better — 
the team of Sousa and West fought their way into the main 
draw, beating Azusa Pacific’s team. The duo then faced 
the top-seeded pairing of Hanfmann and Emilio Gomez 
of USC, falling 8-5. 

Chan and Giganti fought their way to an 8-3 victory 
against LMU’s Robin Kiyabu and Daniel Simko, shoving 
their way into the main draw as well, but fell to UCLA’s 
Warren Hardie and Dennis Mkrtchian 8-3.

This coming Veteran’s Day weekend, the team travels 
to the campus of UC Santa Barbara for the annual UC 
Santa Barbara Classic Tournament. 
The Tritons will again face a number of the same players 
from last week.

GOLF — The Triton golf team took fourth place this 
Tuesday in the Sonoma State Invitational. Following a 
marginal showing on Monday in which the Tritons sat 
in fifth place, the Tritons fought their way to a fourth-
place finish in the team’s last scheduled tournament of 
Fall Quarter.

The men’s golf team finished 33 strokes behind 
nationally ranked No. 3 Chico State, who was only 
18 strokes over par, an amazing feat considering they 
played the 18-hole course three times in two days.

Freshman Jay Lim was the Tritons’ top performer, 
finishing 17th overall in a field of over a hundred 
with scores of 76, 73 and 75 on the par 71 course. Not 
only does the freshman lead the Tritons in Sonoma, 
but Lim also leads the team overall, hitting the lowest 
average score of 75.7.

Sophomore Jacob Williams shot just 17 over par 
to finish in 23rd, while sophomore teammate Lewis 
Simon led on the second day with a score of 74 to fin-
ish 16 over par, good for the 26th overall finish.

“[Lim] played pretty solid. You can always do bet-
ter, but he did pretty well,” said assistant coach Keith 
Okasaki. “Jacob Williams was our second best fin-
isher, he’s been having a couple rough tournaments, 
but I think he’s starting to get his stuff together. So I 
think we can take a couple of good things away into 
the off season.”

Tritons sophomores David Smith and Fredrick 
Palmer-Picard propped up the young team, both fin-
ishing 17 over par at 27th place.

“We’re getting a little better, we tried a couple of 
new things leading into the tournament that seemed 
to help our performance,” Okasaki said. “It could have 
been better, but we did beat Monterey Bay, who won 
the national championship last year, as well as East 
Bay who’s also in our conference.”

The young UCSD team has done very well during 
the opening quarter of the 2011-12 season, and big 
things are certain to come as the Tritons take a break 
and return to competition at the San Marcos Cougar 
Invitational on Feb. 6 to Feb. 7.

valuable defensive player of the year award. 
UCSD freshman midfielder Cassie Callahan was 
awarded the CCAA Newcomer of the Year award.

The number of quality players in the starting 
eleven and off the Triton bench lends itself to a 
brand of soccer that makes it hard for opponents 
to keep UCSD off the board. Fifteen different 
Tritons have recorded goals for UCSD this sea-
son — six of whom have finished with three or 
more.

“There hasn’t really been a standout on our 
team in the past few years,” Armstrong said. 
“That’s not to say that we don’t have great players, 
but our offense is coming from all over the pitch 
now. Our midfielders are scoring, our defenders 
are scoring, and a lot of goals have been coming 
from the bench too.”

Further, the starting eleven, which features 

five seniors and five juniors, is a core group that 
has been playing with each other for the past 
three seasons.

“We’re just getting better with experience,” 
Armstrong said. “We know the way every person 
on the field plays, we know the runs that we need 
to make, and we know how to react in certain 
situations.”

When asked about UCSD’s outlook and 
expectations in the Regional rounds, senior cap-
tain Annie Wethe said that the Tritons are look-
ing to stay the course.

“We’re not really changing anything in our 
game, it’s been working for us all season, and now 
it’s just a matter of playing our best,” said Wethe. 
“We know that our best is better than everybody 
else’s best.”

After being upset by fourth-seeded CSU Stanislaus in the CCAA conference tourna-ment, the women’s soccer team looks to 
rebound this weekend in the NCAA Division II 
national tournament.

Despite the semifinal upset, the Tritons remain 
the top seed in the West Region and will host the first 
and second rounds of Regionals. UCSD will advance 
to the second round with a first-round bye, and 
will play against the winner of the rematch between 
CCAA opponents Chico State and CSU Stanislaus. 
The two Northern California rivals faced each other 
just last Sunday, Nov. 6 to decide the conference 
champion, and No. 4 CSU Stanislaus went away with 
a commanding 4-0 win against No. 3 Chico State. The 
winner will move onto face the Tritons in the second 
round this Sunday, Nov. 13.

Chico and Stanislaus represent the top of the 
Northern California opposition, and are two squads 
that the Tritons have failed to beat this season. Chico 

State (11-6-3) finished the regular season ranked 
No. 3 overall, and took a 0-0 draw against 

UCSD in their one conference matchup.
“Chico’s a really similar team to 
us. They play the same forma-

tion, and they do a very good job of keeping posses-
sion and moving the ball around,” senior goalkeeper 
Kristin Armstrong said. “Last time we played against 
them, they pressured us really high and all over the 
field. And they’re also very dangerous on corner 
kicks.”

But CSU Stanislaus may pose more of a threat, as 
the Warriors enter the NCAA Division II tournament 
with a lot of momentum. Stanislaus (11-4-5) overall 
has won four out of their last five matches, in which 
they have managed to outscore their opponents 15-1.

“They’re a really strong team going forward, and 
are especially dangerous attacking down the sides,” 
Armstrong said. “They’re also very quick and very 
athletic.”

However, UCSD is in top form for its second 
round bout against CCAA opposition. The Tritons 
have a 13-2-4 record overall, finishing at the top of 
the conference at the end of the regular season. UCSD 
also boasts five All-Conference First Team Selections: 
senior captain Annie Wethe, senior captain Sarah 
McTigue, senior midfielder Shelby Wong, 
junior defender Hayley Johnson and senior 
goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong — who 
was also awarded the league’s most
