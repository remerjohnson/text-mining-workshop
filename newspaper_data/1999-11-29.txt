MOSCOW - In a fresh sign 
that the Russian military plans to 
bombard Grozny into submis-
sion, the Russian government 
said Sunday that it would open a 
safe passage for desperate civil-
ians to flee the Chechen capital, 
which has been under a wither-
ing assault for days. 

While Russian officials said 
the move was intended to reduce 
civilian casualties, it also 
appeared designed to mute 
Western criticism that Russia was 
harming its own citizens in 
Chechnya more than the Islamic

'1IruUI c.Im' In IIIOtIoft: The student cast, conSisting of Amy Chang, Deborah Lhose, Wendy 
Inouye and Alison Dietterle, rehearses its work in front of choreographer Kevin Wynn. 

Famed Choreographer Visits UCSD 
DANCE: Kevin Wynn is working on campus with students and professionals 
By HANNAH GRIFRTH 
Staff Writer 

Renowned modern dance 
choreographer Kevin Wynn left 
New York City to spend the 
past three weeks in residency at 
UCSD. Working with dancers 
from both UCSD and the com-
munity, Wynn choreographed a 
new dance piece. 

The -dance, tentatively titled 
"Brutal Calm," will have two 
versions: one to be performed 
by UCSD students in next quar-
ter's "An Evening of Dance" 
and one to be performed this 
weekend at San Diego State 
University by professor Jean 
Isaacs' company, the San Diego 
Dance Theater. 

Wynn said that the two 
pieces have their similarities 
and differences. 

"Structurally, the two pieces 
are tRe same," he ' said. 
"Movement wise, a lot of ttmes 
they're not." 

Wynn worked daily in the 
dance studio with both UCSD 
students and professional 
dancers, including alumna 
Elizabeth Lee, student Alison 
Dietterle and dance department 
instructors Tonnie Sammartano 

and Terry Wilson. Dancer 
Veronica Martin of the San 
Diego Dance Theater is the only 
non-affiliate. The student cast 
consists of Amy Chang, Wendy 
Inouye, Deborah Lhose, 
Cameron Thrash and Dietterle. 

Having two groups not only 
enabled more dancers to expe-
rience a new choreographer, it 
also helped the younger 
dancers cope more successfully 
with complex material. Wynn 
stressed the importance of 
open-mindedness in new meth-
ods of working. 

"To see those students 
observing [the professionals' 
work], watching them trying to 
figure it out, how to accomplish 
what I wanted them to do, " he 
said. "I think that was half the 
battle." 

. Wynn said that dancers of 
both levels described the 
rehearsals as intense. 

"For some of them, it was ... 
not traumatic, but a different 
way of working," Wynn said. "I 
knew I wanted to challenge 
them with new information, but 
where they took it and how I 
used them in relation to the 
piece really depended on them." 

Wynn said that he also likes 

to challenge his audiences by 
presenting an "open frame" 
stage, with many things hap-
pening at once. 

"If you think you're going to 
see everything the first time, 
you can forget it," he said. "I 
don't want you to, anyway. I 
don't want you to 'get it' all in 
the first shot." 

Wynn has taught and 
toured with his company, the 
Kevin Wynn Collection, in 
more than 13 countries on 
three continents, and has done 
residencies in italy, Holland, 
Israel and Hong Kong. Wynn 
has also worked with the Jose 
Limon Dance Company, 
Laurie Carlos, Vernon Reid 
and Living Color, Mel Wong, 
Kazuko Hirabayashi, Daniel 
Nagrin and Jacques d' 
Amboise. 

This is the second time 
Wynn has come to San Diego. 
He came two years ago when 
Isaacs invited him to teach at an 
annual summer workshop.

Traffic 
Plan 
Unveiled 
HIGHWAYS: Proposal 
would cost $29 billion 
over the next 20 years 
By PARISA BAHARIAN 
Staff Writer 

The San Diego Association of 
Governments last week in Old 
Town unveiled a $29 billion plan 
for reducing traffic congestion 
and improving public trans-
portation fo r the next two 
decades. 

antee Mayor Jack Dale, who 
serves as chai rman of SA DAG's 
transportation subcommittee, 
said the new plan aims to ea e 
traffic congestions. 

"We must look to expand both 
ollr freewa y capacity and transit 
services," he said 

Despite the foreca ted one 
million more residents and a half 
million more jobs, officials say 
highway traffic bottlenecks in 
the San Diego region will be 
reduced from 63 miles to 29 
miles by 2020. 

The association defines a traf-
fic bottleneck as any stretch of 
freeway where the amount of 
vehicles travelling on it exceeds 
its capacity. 

The proposed transportation 
plan includes $6.45 billion for 
highway projects, more than 
$4.46 billion for transit projects 
and new buses, $3.94 billion for 
highway maintenance and near-
ly $5.2 billion for transit opera-
tions. The plan proposes an 
additional $9.4 billion to pay for 
local road building and mainte-
nan,ce. 

Approximately 66 miles of 
new highways are proposed 
through the new construction 
with the expansion of segments 
of Routes 52, 54, 56, 94, 125 and 
Routes 905 and 11 along the 
international border. Highway 
widening, interchange construc-
tion and bus and carpool lanes 
are proposed on segments of 
most other San Diego County 
routes. 

Curt Lutz, the campus 
rideshare coordinator for UCSD 
Transportation and Parking 
Services, said that building and 
expanding more freeways may 
not result in less congestion until 
people become less dependent on 
their own cars. 

"We cannot build our way 
out," Lutz said. "We must look 
for other solutions." 

To encourage the community 
to use public transportation, 
Lutz said the government asso-
ciation must expand express ser-
vices and increase feeder ser-
vices in order to make bus stops 
more accessible for students and 
to the general public.

TRAFFIC: between proposed policy and implementation of the policy 
due to lack of funding: Lutz 
said. 

Plan would increase 
number of bus stops SANDAG officials estimate 

the region will receive 517.9 bil-
lion to fund the plan from feder-
al, state and local tax dollars. 
However, that will leave the asso-
ciation's 2020 Transportation 
Plan with a projected 511 .5 billion 
deficit.

Director Lee Hultgren said more 
trolley lines and better services 
for the Coaster will help allevi-
ate the transportation congestion 
in San Diego. SANDAG officials have two 

potential sources Hultgren 
added that the to fund their plan. 

The first solution 
would be to 
renew the 1/2 
percent local 
transportation 
sales tax, known 
as TransNet, 
when it expires in 
2008. The second 
solution that offi-
cials recommend 
is to raise the 
gasoline tax. 

proposed trans-
portation plan 
will help students 
to commute to 
and from school 
faster by increas-
ing the number of 
stops the buses 
make in the coun-
ty and decreasing 
the time between 
buses from 20 to 
30 minutes down 
to only 10 min-
utes. 

Hultgren added that 
the proposed 
transportation plan 
will help students to 
commute to and 
from school faster 
by increasing the 
number of stops the 
buses make in the 
county and 
decreasing the time 
between buses from 
twenty to thirty 
minutes down to 
only ten minutes. 

Hultgren said 
the probability of 
the public passing 
the necessary tax 
increases to fund 
the transportation 
plan by a 50 per-
cent margin is 

She said that 
the proposed 
increase in bus 
service will not

reductions in dis- very good

for a gas tax increase that keeps 
up with inflation. 

counts. 
Hultgren also said that within 

seven years, trolley extensions 
will serve both UCSD and San 
Diego State University. 

Yet Lutz said that since rough-
ly 3 percent of the population in 
San Diego use public transporta-
tion, it is impossible to predict 
whether the majority of the vot-
ers will support such a tax 
increase to 'fund the transporta-
tion plan. 

Lutz said that while he wel-
comes the improvements the 
plan proposes, he does not want 
to be too optimistic about it 
because of monetary concerts.

The debate over prayer at high school football games centers on the 
issue of freedom of speech and students' constitutional rights 
By KEVIN SEiD 
Staff Writer 

The First Amendment pre-
sents two distinct, conflicting 
rules regarding religion. 
Under the establishment 
clause, the U.S. government 
cannot pass laws endorsing a 
specific religion. But the free 
speech and free exercise claus-

es protect pri-

speech 
and the 
free exer-
cise of 
religion, 

respectively. 
Next spring, 

the U.S. Supreme Court will 
once again grapple with this 
issue. The justices have agreed 
to review a U.S. appeals court 
ruling that the Santa Fe 
Independent School District in 
Texas violated the establish-
ment clause by allowing stu-
dent-initiated, student-led 
prayers before football games. 

The Supreme Court's last 
major decision on school 
prayer was in 1992 In Lee v. 
WelslIlnll . The justices ruled 
that clergy-led prayers are not 
allowed at high school gradua-
tion ceremonies or other 
school activities, saying that 
the establishment clause pro-
hibits public schools from 
organizing and sponsoring 
such religious exercises .. 

But the issue of students 
reading prayers at football 
games is different. In this case it 
is mainly students who are 
exercising their rights of free 

religious expression and free 
speech. The school district is not 
violating the establishment 
clause. It is merely permitting 
religious student speech on a 
nondiscriminatory basis. 

Everyone has a right to 
pray in public, a religious exer-
cise that is 
fully protect-

was just providing a forum for 
students to speak without 
regard to the content of the 
message. 

Just because a message has 
religious content is not suffi-
cient reason to warrant gov-
ernment restriction. The free 

speech clause 

ed under the 
free exercise 
clause. It is an 
essential part 
o f 
Christianity, 
Judaism, 
Islam and P.!~ 

prohibits 
"viewpoint 
discdmina-
tion." The 
federal gov-
ernment must 
accommodate 
any and all 
viewpoints in 

. many other 
religions. 
Whether you like it or not, 
there are some people that feel 
it is very important to pray 
before they perform many 
everyday activities. 

More importantly, prayer is 
also religious speech and 
expression. As such, it is pro-
tected under the free speech 
clause. A prayer is essentially a 
verbal message that contains 
religious content. But, like a 
poem, song, dance or other 
form of expression, a prayer 
can also convey meanings, 
ideas and opinions. 

The key point in this case is 
that it is the students who are 
initiating and leading the 
prayers. The school district's 
.Iction was within the bounds 
of the establishment clause. Its 
policy was neutral and secular. 
Any student who wishes to 
deliver any message or invoca-
tion before game time is per-
mitted to do so. The school 

public forums 
where anyone 

can express his or her personal 
views. A person's message 
cannot be restricted on the 
basis of its content, religious or 
otherwise. 

The Supreme Court has 
already decided that public 
schools must not discriminate 
on the religious content of stu-
dent activities. In two cases, 
the court has ruled that all stu-
dents must be provided equal 
access to resources and facili-
ties. The court in Wl's/slde 
Board of Edllca/IOII v. Mergells 
(1990) ruled that public schools 
must alIo}\' student prayer 
groups to meet and worship if 
other student groups are also 
permitted to meet. In 
Rosenber8er v. University of 
Virginia (1995), the high court 
decided that if public institu-
tions provide funding for secu-
lar student-run publications, 
they must also fund student 
religious publications as well. 

If student-led prayers 
before football games are.pro-
hibited, public school officials 
would be able to scrutinize 
and censor the religious con-
tent of student messages and 
prayers. This is not allowed 
under the First Amendment. 

"Students are entitled to 
freedom of expression of their 
views," wrote associate Justice 
Abe Fortas in Tillker v. Des 
Moines (1969). "When he is in 
the cafeteria, or on the playing 
field, or on the campus during 
the authorized hours, he may 
express his opinions." 

Banning the rights to free 
speech and free religious 
expression on public property 
or at government events 
would set a dangerous prece-
dent. .One reason why the 
appeals court struck down the 
school's policy was that the 
religious content of the prayers 
were "delivered to a govern-
ment-organized audience, by 
means of government-owned 
appliances and equipment, on 
government-controlled prop-
erty, at a government-spon-
sored event." 

If constitullonal rights were 
prohibited using this logic, 
critics of local government pol-
icy would be banned from 
speaking at city council meet-
ings. Protesters would be pro-
hibited from marching on the 
steps of the capitol or express-
ing their grievances in front of 
the White House. 

The drawback of free speech 
and expression is that anyone

Religious infiltration in Santa Fe Independent School District threatens 
. the constitutional principle of separation of church' and state . 
By JEREMY UVIANU 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

The debate over separation 
of church and state has again 
reared its ugly head - this time 
in the Santa Fe Independent 
School District in Texas. The 
school district is in the process 
of appealing a U.S. appeals 
court ruling that alleged it had 
violated the Constitution by 
allowing student-led prayers at 
football games. 

The First Amendment 
requires the separation of 
church and state, and the 
Supreme Court has upheld 
this institution in several land-
mark cases. In the 223-year his-
tory of our country, the 
Supreme COLlrt has typically 
maintained a policy of stare 
decisis - of letting the prece-
dent set by previous decisions 
stand. The authors of the Bill of 
Rights set a precedent by 
establishing this restriction, 
and the appeal by the Santa Fe 
Independent School District 
will undoubtedly fail on con-
stitutional grounds. 

Several landmark Supreme 
Court cases have set the stJn-
dard in cases of separation of 
church and state. In the case of 
[ /lgl'l v. VI/nil' (1962), the 
Supreme Court ruled in a six-

Transfer Students Lack Housing Dispelling Misconceptions 
Editor: 
Showing incredible myopia, 

the article "Fascist Conspiracy 
Found Br~wlOg at UCSD" (Nov. 
22) missed the fact that thou-
sands of students are already 
floundering about in the raven-
ous housing market of southern 
Ca I i fornia, unceremoniously 
denied all housing benefits by a 
school that has repeatedly 
shown little or no care for our 
class of students. 

Sophomores are getting a 
taste of what transfer students 
have had to endure with a smile 
since admission. We were not 
allowed one day of on-campus 
hOUSing. We were told that our 
needs were not as important as 
the freshman classes, and that 
under no circumstances would 
we be accommodated. What's 
more, many of us were told 
before accepting admission here 
that housing wollid be available. 
The impolite term for this is hav-
ing sunshine blown up our 
asses. The polite one is being lied 
to by our own administration. 

Transfer students at UCSD 
have been treated as second-
class members of the student 
body, merely because we chose 
not to pay $14,000 a year for our 
first two years of general educa-
tion. The next time you want to 
rail against the system, ask one 
of us how much we like the San 
Diego Transit System, which 
takes two hours to get from 
Mission Valley to UCSD, or how 
much we enjoyed being lied to 
until we arrived in San Diego, or 
how we felt after being dumped 
into a city that many of us were 
no more prepared to navigate 
than freshmen or sophomores. 

We were treated far more 
unfairly than the sophomore 
class, but no one seems to know

Protests Cruelty 

Editor: 
I found Bertrand Fan's article 

("Vegetarianism Trend Is a Sign 
of a Sick Society," Nov. 18) par-
ticularly offensive. It seems as if 
the only rea!Xln for the 

EARll I 

article was to state that killing 
animals is fun and that fat peo-
ple won' t lose weight by being 
vegetarian. . 

I do not believe the author is 
aware of the suffering that many 
animals go through on the way 
to your dinner table. He calls the 
(usually unenforced) federal 
law stating that all animals 
should be stunned as "one of 
the stupidest victories animal 
rights groups have won." 

When cows are killed, they 
are generally hoisted into the air 
by their hind legs, which, not 
being designed for that type of 
movement, often break. Their 
throats are then slit, to allow the 
blood to drain out onto the 
floor. During this entire process, 
the animal is still alive and con-
scious. I am incredulous that the 
author would even think of call-
ing people who try to stop this 
abuse by refusing to purchase 
the meat of animals "a sign of a 
sick society." 

The author even states that, 
while he enjoys "watching baby 
vegetables die," he would rather 
see a "slaughtered baby chick-
en" that hadlived out its life in a 
"crowded, filthy warehouse." 
This is essentially saying "tortur-
ing and killing animals is what I 
think is funny and will get my 
jollies off the imagined pain of 
vegetables if I can't get it from 
animals." 

We have been taught that to 
inflict pain on other organisms is 
wrong. Anybody who has ever 
even owned a pet knows that 
animals have feelings. They 
love, hate, become happy or sad, 
change moods and feel fear 
when threatened. It is with these 
same emotions that we define

Does the fact that most people

8 NEWS The UCSD Guardian 

President Clinton to Sign Bill Offering 
Food Assistance to Sudane.e Rebel. 

WASHINGTON - President 
Clinton is about to sign a bill 
permitting the administration 
to pursue a contentious strate-
gy agai nst the Islamic govern-
ment in Sudan by giving food 
assistance directly to rebels 
who have been fighting the 
authorities in Khartoum, the 
country's capital, for 16 years. 

The plan is designed by its 
advoca tes in ' the State 
Department and the National 
Security Council to strengthen 
the military operations of the 
Sudan People 's Liberation 
Army and to isolate the govern-
ment, which Washington has 
accused of backing internation-
al terrorism. 

But critics, including some 
administration officials as well 
as major humanitarian groups, 
contend that giving food to the 
rebels is another example of the 
evolving administration policy 
of humanitarian intervention 
that inserts the United States on 
one side of a civil war as square-
ly as when the Reagan adminis-
tration supported an ti-commu-
nist guerrillas in Africa and 
Latin America . 

Further, providing suste-
nance to fighters - using food 
as a weapon of war - contra-
venes the long-held principle of 
neutrality in food assistance dur-

ing conflicts, said Julia Taft, the 
assistant secretary of state for 
refugees and humanitarian 
assistance.

aid," she said. 
Clinton is to sign an aid bill 

that authorizes direct assistance 
to the rebels in southern Sudan 
on Monday. 

The language was included 
in the bill by a group of Senate 

and House members with the 
backing of the assistant secretary 
of state for African affairs, Susan 
Rice, and the director for Africa 
at the National Security Council, 
Gayle Smith. 

The civil war in Sudan has 
raised high emotions in 
Congress and in the administra-
tion because it pits a rigid 
Islamic regime against Christian 
rebels. 

Church coalitions have 
charged that the government 
organizes militias to abduct 
southerners into slavery and 
transport them to the north. 

John Pendergast, a special 
adviser to Ms. Rice, said the 
food aid would enable the 
rebels to maintain poSitions in 
the parched territory where 
they are fighting the northern 
army and governfnent-backed 
militia. 

"This is so forces can eat more 
easily and resupply ·forces in 
food-deficit areas," Pendergast 
said. 

It is hoped that the food will 
allow the rebels "t<1 stay in posi-
tion or expand positions in 
places where it is difficult to 
maintain' a logistical line," he 
added.

BOSTON - The presidential 
primary season this week enters 
a frantic two-month sprint to the 
Iowa caucuses and the New 
Hampshire primary as the con-
tenders deliver their pitches in a 
blast of speeches, debates and 
television commercials. 

Virtually all the activity until 
February will be concentrated in 
those two states, which for years 
have held outsized influence in 
the nomination process. 

Many politicians and analysts 
had predicted that Iowa and 
New Hampshire would play less 
of a role in the 2000 campaign 
because several larger states, 
notably California and New 
York, had moved up their pri-
maries so they would gain more 
influence. 

But candidates have not 
dared to shortchange Iowa or 
New Hampshire, though many 
have continued the custom of 
tromping through California to 
replenish their campaign cof-
fers. If anything, New Hamp-
shire and Iowa have taken on 
greater consequence because of 
a sense among tre campaigns 
that if they do not survive those 
states it will not matter how 
well they are positioned else-
where. 

As a result, voters in both 
states have been beSieged with 
mailings, television and radio 

advertisements, and visits by 
candidates. 

"This is countdown time, the 
24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-
week campaign," said Michael 
Whouley, Vice President AI 
Gore's chief strategist in Iowa 

''This is countdown time, 
the 24-hour-a-day, seven-
days-a-week campaign. 
It's only going to get more 
intense. You hope at this 
point that your state 
organization can take 
advantage of 
opportunities where your 
guy puts himself in an 
advantageous position -
or your opponent makes 
a mistake." 

-Michael Whouley 
AI Gore's chief strategist 

in Iowa and New Hampshire 

and New Hampshire. " It's only 
going to get more intense. You 
hope at this point that your state 
organization can take advantage 
of opportunities where your guy 
puts himself in an advantageous 
position - or your opponent 
makes a mistake." 

Probably the best evidence of 
the fierce competition in New 
Hampshire could be found on 
television on Sunday in, of all 
places, Boston, where viewers 
were swamped with commer-
cials extolling Sen. John McCain 
of Arizona as a war hero, George 
W. Bush as an accomplished 
governor of Texas and former 
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey 
as a gifted legislator. 

The primary in Massac-
husetts is not until March 7, but 
campaigns are pouring money 
into Boston television in a drive 
to reach voters in southern 
New Hampshire who watch the 
Boston stations. While advertis-
ing here is more costly than in 
Manchester, N .H., it saves the 
campaigns that accept federal 
money from eating up the limit 
on how much they can spend in 
New Hampshire. 

In the past week, Bradley has 
pumped by far the most money 
into Massachusetts television; 
the campaign put the figure at 
$252,000, plus another $73,600 in 
New Hampshire. Strategists 
here said they had never seen 
one candidate spend so milch on 
Boston television so early, and 
the blitz is not expected to slow 
anytime soon.

new study 
shows that car 
accidents, sui-
cide and homi-
cide are some 
of the leading 
causes of death 
among young 

between the ages of 17 
and 24. However, there is one 
other growing epidemic to add 
to this list. The spread of 
Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome has become a world-
wide problem, affecting people 
of all races and ages. AIDS has 
become a growing epidemic 
among college students, and the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention estimates that one in 
every 300 college students is liv-
ing with AIDS. 

AIDS is caused by the human 
immunodeficiency virus, which 
kills cells in the immune system, 
thereby destroying the body's 
ability to fight infections and 
certain cancers. According to 
the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases, HIV is 
sfread most commonly by sexu-
a contact with an infected part-
ner but can also be spread 
through contact with infected 
blood. The disease can also be 
spread by injection drug users 
who share needles that are cont-
aminated with the blood of 
someone infected with the 
virus. 

The spread of AIDS has 
become a growing problem on 

college campuses, and the 
Cancer Institute 
one in four new 

in the United 
in people under 

22, and one-half of all 
in people under 

puses has prevented the estab-
lishment of these programs at 
all universities. 

The University of California, 
San Francisco AIDS Research 
Institute states that 13 states do 
not require schools to provide 
STD/HIV education. While 
there are several HIV education 
programs presented in class-
rooms across America, many 
issues such as condom use are 
overlooked . Although studies 
have shown that over half of all 
college students at most univer-
sities are sexually active, there 
are not enough programs that 
include HIV testing and coun-
seling designed to educate stu-
dents about the dangers of 
HIV/AIDS. 

"We cannot accept the 
repeated toll of HIV infection on 
our youth," said Helene Gayle, 
director of the Center for Dis-. 
ease Control's National Center 
for HIV Prevention. "There is 
increasing evidence that a wide 
range of /revention messages 
are neede to reduce this toiL" 

Although most college stu-
dents are aware of the risks 
involved in unprotected sex, 
few who engage in this type of 
behavior consistently take the 
proper precautions to avoid 
being infected by HIV. 

Chris Collins, a representa-
tive from the Center for AIDS 
Prevention Studies at UC San 
Francisco recognizes that young 
adults often do not understand 
the magnitude of the risks 
involved with contracting HIV. 

"Young people today identi-
fy AIDS as one of the most seri-
ous threats facing the nation in 
the next century," said Collins. 
"Yet they often do not perceive 
themselves to be personally at 
risk." 

December 1 is World AIDS 
Day, the only annual interna-
tional day of organized action 
against AIDS. The theme for this 
year's event is "Children & 
Young People: Listen, Learn, 
Live." The creators of the event 
say that this theme properly 
reflects the idea that the most · 
promising approach for reduc-
ing the spread of HIV world-
wide reaching out to young 
people. ' 

Lack of concern may prove 
backfire on young adults who

OBSERVATIONS 

BEN GLEIBERMAN 
Contributing Staff Writer 
The other night I was driving 

in my car with one of my good 
friends when we drove by the 
University Towne Center mall. 

A bunch of golden Christmas 
lights had just bee.n put up over 
the UTC Sign, and my friend got a 
big smile on her face and said, 
"Ben, look how beautiful those 
lights are." I noticed that for that 
moment, she was happy. 

Before I had the chance to 
make a sarcastic response, like I 
probably would usually, I fell vic-
tim as well. I caught the lights in 
my field of view, and a smile 
crept onto my face. I realized that 
I, too, was suddenly happier. 
Wow! Thank you, UTC, for bring-
ing such joy to my life and to 
those whom I care for. 

This is exactly what is wrong 
with our society. 

Allow me to explain. You see, I 
guarantee that UTC as a whole 
nas no concern for our happiness. 
If those lights weren't thought to 
attract more people to the mall in 
this joyous holiday season, they 
wouldn't be up there. Their 
unspoken motto is "'Tis the sea-
son to capitalize on people's 
latent winter depression by mak-
ing them feel the more they buy, 

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES II 

HAPPINESS .F·OR SALE HERE 
A (What to Buy' guide for achieving happiness this holiday season 
the more in the spirit of the holi-
days they are." It's a clever motto, 
just not very catchy, and probably 
not that good to use on a bill-
board. 

The awkward news is that 
UTC is not alone in this endeavor. 
They are joined by every mall, 
store, commercial, corporation, 
TV show, radio station and movie 
in the world. They bank on the 
fact that society's endless pursuit 

salesman to tell us how we can be 
more happy. Ironically, that road 
to happiness always seems to 
include buying something. 
Funny, huh? I mean when was 
the last time you saw an infomer-
cial telling you that all you need 
to be happy is to look around and 
realize how lucky you are? Been 
a while, right? That's because 
there's not much money in it. 
When happiness comes from 

Gym is going to be appealing. 
Your mind will follow this sim-
ple, yet unfortunate, thought 
process: ['m sad. Chuck looks happy. 
He's probably happy becallse of his 
muscles. Maybe if I buy 'Total Gym,' 
['II become happy and strong, and 
one day ['II have a show as cool as 
"Walker, Texas Ranger." 

This thought process is unfor-
tunate for three reasons. First, 
you'll likely never use the Total 

Wben happiness comes from inside you, the company 
can't charge shipping and handling. And I think we all 
agree that tme happiness can't be found unless you're 
paying at least eight dolla,rs in shipping and handling, 

for happiness results in this insa-
tiable commodity fetish that will 
always keep the public wanting 
more and feeling not quite happy 
enough. That phrase is the source 
of much of our undoing: "not 
quite happy enough." Most of us 
are happy, but ooh, that one thing 
will make us sooo much happier. 

This stems from the common 
mistake that we all too often 
define our happiness by external 
tangibles rather than by interper-
sonal successes. We are made 
more happy by products instead 
of by people. People, including 
me, have come to believe for 
some reason that we. need some 

inside you, the company can't 
charge shipping and handling. 
And I think we all agree that true 
happiness can't be found unless 
you're paying at least eight dol-
lars in shipping and handling. 

I guess that makes sense, 
though. I mean, true inner happi-
ness couldn't make you really as 
content as, say, a Buttmaster, or 
maybe a Ronco Rotisserie Oven. I 
think that's pretty clear. Infomer-
cials are the ultimate example of 
trying to sell some happiness to 
unsatisfied people. 

If you're depressed and can't 
fall asleep at three in the morning, 
seeing Chuck Norris sell the Total 

Gym after you waste a thousand 
dollars on it; second, it won't 
make you happier; third, and per-
haps most importantly, there are 
no shows as cool as "Walker, 
Texas Ranger." 

Even when they can' t think of 
an actual product to sell that will 
increase your happiness, they'll 
sell you ~mething really great, 
like "personal power!" Can you 
believe that? I can attain person-
al power through simply order-
ing a package on television. 
That's so great! I can listen every 
day to an audio tape (or CD for 
just a little more) of Anthony Rob-
bins telling me how special I am, 

or in essence how much power I 
really have! It's essentially a 
superhero in a box. I'm gonna 
buy it, then hit the streets and 
fight crime. 

Maybe I'm immersing myself 
too much in pop culture. I think 
instead I'll sit back and relax with 
a good book. Like Barbara Ann 
Kipper's 14,000 Things to be Happy 
About. This book, if one can 
debase the word so much as to 
call it that, is a perfect example of 
how people just can' t be happy 
on their own and need some sort 
of guide to show them where 
happiness can be found . 

Well, allow me to share just a 
few of the list of 14,000 wonder-
ful things Barbara reminds us of: 
Long socks, humble pie, tam-o'-
shanters (what?), a candelabra of 
han'd-crafted tin, containers, 
cinch belts, the phrase "half a loaf 
is better than none," the honking 
of auto horns (one that 's brought 
me a lot of joy, and ironically, per-
sonal power), the whimsy of kit-
tens, George and Ringo of the 
Beatles (sorry Paul and John, you 
just don' t make Barbara happy), 
halter tops (oka y, that one, I 
agree), playing horsey, "made in 
Japan" labels (not soothing, but 
hard to avoid), kidskin and 
snakeskin, that vacation feeling, 
Irish linen place mats (one that 
undoubtedly has stopped wars 
with all the joy it's brought), dec-

AIDS: 
Research focused on 
finding a cure 
ContInued from ...... 
don' t believe they are susceptible 
to contracting the disease. 
According to the World AIDS 
Campaign, at least a third of the 
30 million people alive today 
with HIV infection of AIDS are 
young people aged 10 to 24. 
Every day, 7000 young people all 
over the world are infected with 
the virus. 

With the number of AIDS 
cases among young adults grow-
ing larger every day and the lim-
ited available resources on some 
college campuses, it is becoming 
harder and harder for young 
adults to educate themselves 
about the spread of HIV / AIDS. 

In recent years, the chances of 
a woman contracting the disease 
have grown, and according to the 
ARI, the rate of HIV infection 
appears to be growing faster 
among young women than any 
other group. The ARI states that 
the number of HIV cases .among 
women has increased from 19 
percent to 56 percent in the past 
few years. . 

Among young adults, there 
has also been a growing racial 
disparity in relation to the spread 
of the AIDS epidemic. The ARI 
reports that 61 percent of AIDS 
cases in Americans aged 20 to 24 
are among people of color, partic-
ularly African Americans and 
Latinos. 

The AIDS epidemic among the 
African American community in 
particular has been steadily 
growing in recent years. In Octo-
ber 1998, the Harvard AIDS Insti-
tute estimated that by the year 
2000 more than half of aU U.S . 
AIDS cases will be among African 
Americans. According to the 
Institute, by the year 2qoo,.an 
African American will be nine 
times as likely to have AIDS as 
someone who is not African 
American. It has been said that 
young African Americans are at a 
particularly high risk of contract-
Ing the virus. 

There has been a great deal of 
focus placed on finding a cure for 
AIDS. Research institutions all 
over the world have committed 
themselves to developing it cure 
for one of the most prevalent epi-
demics among people of all age 
groups and all races.

As an active 
politician, J would 
like to see Rebecca 
Romijn, because we 
could use a change 
of pace. 

Mike Mancini 
Marshall freshman 

Elizabeth Dole. She 
would be appropriate 
because she was 
already president of 
the Red Cross. It 
shows that she would 
be very concerned for 
the American people. 

M .... Au 
Warren junior 

Ross Perot. Hey why 
not, he's rich. 

Carrie Grabenauer 
Marshall senior 

I would like to see 
Bradley, because he 
represents a better 
side of the 
Democratic Party 
than Gore . 

Nathan Baker 
gr'!duate student 

George W. Bush. I 
saw him on TV last 
week and thought he 
had a pretty good 
platform.

COACH: 
Soccer finals help 
exercise demons 
ContInued from ..... 20 
demons of last year to rest. 
UCSD defeated College of New 
Jersey and Macalester both 1-0, 
and Alfredson had both goals. 
She was amazing - she was the 
MVP on a team chocked full of 
heroes. 

Alfredson finally played to 
her potential and proved that she 
could carry a team on her back. 
She fought through some nasty 

injuries and kept playing the 
best soccer of her life - to say 
she was inspirational would be 
an understatement. 

Also in the inspirational cate-
gory was the Triton defense. 
After the first round game 
against Cal Lutheran, sweeper 
Julia Cuder and fullbacks Kara 
Morris and Emma Borst did not 
allow another goal. 

They were ridiculously good 
Without Cuder on the squad 

this year, McManus would have 
been forced to play either Liz 
Schilling or Janine Harispe at 
sweeper, which would have seri-
ously h~rt his midfield. Cuder's 

The UCSD Guardian 

outstanding play back there 
allowed Schilling and Harispe to 
move up and dominate the mid-
field. 

I think what I'm trying to say 
is that UCSD was pretty damn 
good in Massachusetts. New 
Jersey and Macalester were the 
two best tearns they played all 
year, and if the Tritons played 
like they did when they hosted 
regionals, there was no way they 
were going to win. 

However, McManus got his 
troops to sack up and play their 
best soccer of the season. And 
while Alfredson and Cuder were 
'the stars of the show, it's impor-

tant to remember that the glue of 
the team - goalie Jennifer 
Hetland, midfielder Janine 
Harispe and forward Cindy 
Dostalek - did its job of playing 
amazing and keeping everything 
in place. 

Oh, and just sorou guys know, 
I had a wonderfu time watching 
us kick everyone else's butt. 
Wtlliams College was literally out 
in the middle of nowhere - I felt 
\ike I was in the middle of the 
"Blair Witch Project." 

So, to sum it up, Alfredson 
and Cuder were incredible, and 
McManus is a genius. 

And so am I.

CABLE: 
Technology has 
its drawbacks 
c.tIIIIIed fro. ..... 20 
my living room. If I could unearth 
some sort of information about 
the time of the fight or how much 
it would cost to order it from this 
pile of dung. I would be satisfied. 
The challenge was two part: First, 
the pages were damp and wrin-
kled from the carelessness of my 
roommates' beer-handling abili-
ties on the previous night. 
Second, when you don't want to 
be bombarded by ads, they can't 
be escaped, but when you're 
looking for one in particular -
forget it. 

I looked in TV Guide for help. 
Maybe it should have displayed a 
photo of the part of Holyfield's ear 
thatgot bitten off by Mike Tyson in 
order to grab my attention. r have a 
tendency to lose focus when 
searching for things like this some-
times, and maybe displaying a 
grotesque photo of this sort would 
have awakened me out of my 
trance. 

I was lucky enough to have my 
roommate's lovely girlfriend at my 
side, who told me to tum on the 
cable box and flip to the Pay-Per-
View channel. My hope of discov-
ering some information that 
would yield favorable results for 
that night was met with a series of 
I-BOO numbers. I chose the first one 
on the list and dialed it thinking 
that I would receive some cheesy 
electronic voice menu. But what I 
actually heard startled me and pro-
vides a real-life example of all the 
stuff I've been learning about in 
class on why the cable companies 
are making a killing off the average 
television consumer. 

"Welcome to Time Warner 
cable, you have been confirmed 
for tonight's showcase of the 
Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis 
match, which begins at 5 p.m." 
What happened next was just fab-
ulous. "49.95 has been charged 
to your cable balance." 

Voila . That easy! 
Obviously, I really didn't mind 

because I accomplished my objec-
tive ill one step, but what if I had 
been some shmuck just trying to 
find out the cost of the ordering the 
fight? And what if all the numbers 
on the screen didn't lead to the 
same path? You could really get 
screwed if you' re not careful. 

Regardless, I was all set for the ' 
night. The programming I paid 
for, or rather the programming 
that Pay-Per-View automatically 
made . me pay for, was going to 
begin at 5 p.m. with the under-
card fights. Now, I had to find at 
least one other person to share 
this monetary burden with me, so 
I got on the phone with a few of 
the homies and got one commit-
ment and two maybes. Not bad. 

All of a sudden, however, I 
realized that my potentially less-
expensive night was going to be a 
potential major hassle. At approx-
imately 6:30 p.m., I had a shock-
ing recall of memory. I was going 
to the women's volleyball game, 
which started at 7:30. So I got on 
the phone with the one guy who 
said he would pitch. in for the 
fight, and we arranged it so that 
he would meet me at the game 
and drive us back to my pad for 
the fight. (Right now, my car is 
somewhere in Mexico in pieces-
it got stolen two weeks ago.) 

When we walked through the 
door already sippin' our drinks, I 

~Ioded at my televiSion - the 
fight was in the eighth round! I 
pounded one, found" the only tiny 
space left on my couch because 
there were already !ll!Vel'a1 people 
there watching the fight (none of 
whom ended ur chipping in a 
cent), and did al I could to savor 
the final rounds. 

So be careful if you decide to 
order something off television. 
You mildtt get more then you bar-
gained "lor.

STRIDE: Wisconsin is sight for Triton success at nationals 
By IIU IURGD 
Sports Editor 

The National Football 
League has its Superbowl, 
Major League Baseball has its 
World Series, but in the world 
of college athletics the culmi-
nating event in a season is the 
national championships. The 
women's cross country team 
competed in this event 
back on Nov. 
20. 

Going into 
the event, the 
team felt that a 
finish in the top 15 would 
be a challenge and a great 
accomplishment. As it turned 
out, the Tritons finished a 
respectable 17th out of the 24 
competing schools. Their com-
bined times were only three 
minutes out of the top 15. 

The Tritons were again led 
by freshman sensation Carolyn 
Jones. 

As reported in the Nov. 22 
issue of the Guardian, Jones 
came in with a time of 17:08.1,' 
good enough for second place 
overall at the event and first 
among runners competing in 
the team competitio.n. 

This was the best finish by 
any female runner at the 
national championships in 
UCSD history. 

Amie Wu came in second for 
the Tritons with a time of 
18:05.8. Wu's time was good 
enough for 46th place overall. 

The other UCSD runner who 
cracked into the top 100 in the 

l68-runner field com-
peting for the team 

cham-
p i 0 -
nships 
was 
Sa ra h 

Leonard. Leonard, 
who is also a fresh-

man, finished with a time of 
18:40.9, which put her in the 
97th position. 

Laura Cherdack and Caren 
Jordan rounded out the top five 
for the Tritons. Cherdack fin-
ished with a time of 18:56.4 
while Jordan came in just 
behind her with a time of 
18:56.9. The tandem finished in 
126th and 127th, respectively. 

The future is very bright for 
the Triton women, as four of 
their top five runners are fresh-
men. Jones, Leonard, Cherdack 
and Jordan should provide a 

foundation for a great Triton 
team over the next three years. 
As they gain experience and 
develop as runners, these ath-
letes could have the Tritons 
competing for the national 
championships before they 
graduate from UCSD. 

For the men. James Nielson 
qualified for the national cham-
pionship meet on the strength 
of his second-place finish at 
regionals. 

At that meet he finished 
within striking distance of 
regional champion Dave Davis 
of the University of Puget 
Sound. 

At the national champi-
onships Davis again blew away 
the field, winning by over nine 
and a haft seconds. 
Unfortunately Nielson was 
unable to match his perfor-
mance at the regional champi-
onships and came in a disap-
pointing 69th. 

The men's cross country 
team hopes to build on this sea-
son, a year that saw them 
improve dramatically and end 
up second in the western 
region. Next year the national 
championship meet could be 
well within its grasp. 

The Tritons have been facing a 
number of formidable oppo-
nents. 

"It definitely makes us stir it 
up," McGihon said. "It makes us 
do some things we wouldn't 
want to do. Swimming against 

.that fast of an opponent gets us 
to swim faster down into the 
season. We're only three seconds 
off of where we were in the 
finals of last year." 

The Tritons will not be travel-
ing to the Speedo Cup event that 
was scheduled for this Thursday 
through Saturday. 

"The timing is not very good 
right now," said McGihon. "I did-
n't want to have a meet the week-
end after Thanksgiving week-
end." 

The next Triton swim meet is 
nearly a month away when they 
host Harvard on December 20. 

"Swimming is a lot different 
than team-associated sports," 
McGihon said. "We're focused on 
what happens at the end of the 
year. Our team is focused on 
qualifying for the NCAAs. We 
definitely want to have a winning 
season, but it ms nothing to do 
with the end of the year." 

In the third place game, 
Hayward downed Oswego State 
88-80 for respectability. 

Jackson scored 29 and had 11 
rebounds to compliment 21 
points from Walker. 

Mclaughlin again had a fan-
tastic game for Oswego, scoring 
29 while grabbing 12 rebounds, 
but it went for naught as his team 
lost. 

The All-Tournament team fea-
tured three Tritons. 
. Higgins was named the Most 
Valuable Player while 
Christensen and Russ also made 
the team. 

Akken and Hunt of the 
University of Redlands each 
made the team as did Oswego's 
Mclaughlin. 

Earlier in the week, UCSD fell 
to California Lutheran University 
78-67 to extend the season open-
ing losing streak to three. 

After playing Cal Lutheran to 
a 32-32 tie at halftime, the Tritons 
couldn't keep up with Cal 
Lutheran in the second to lead to 
the loss. 

The Triton's leading scorers 
came from off the-bench, as Selby 
scored 14 and Miller added 11. 

Christensen added seven 
rebounds. 

TicketsfortheWATER POLO OPEN-DIVISION NATIONAL 
Cal Lutheran was led by 

Pastor Cuenca, who scored 14 to 
go with six rebounds and six 
assists.

Postcards from 
Massachusetts 

You read it here first. 
Last year, when I was a beer-

bottle wielding, gut-parading, 
quarter-tossing, "Animal 
House" -esque maniac, I wrote a 
column when the UCSD 
women's soccer team lost in a 
huge ufset to unranked 
College 0 St. Benedict (MN), 1-
0, in the first round of the 
NCAA tournament. 

Last yea r 's column cen-
tered around Erika Alfredson, 
a freshma n defender who tried 
to clear the ball against St. 
Ben's but ended up knocking 
the ball into the back of 
UCSD's own net. 

But in that column, I remind-
ed everyone that Head Coach 
Brian McManus was sporting 
nine new freshmen on that 
team, and that he had seen this 
happen before. I told everyone 
tha t McManus knew what kind 
of motivation the St. Ben's loss 
would serve - I also said that 
he knew history repeats itself. 

I was right! He was right! 
They won! 

And I got to see it. Yes folks, 
my jiggly gut was there ill per-
on. 

For the women, it was 
redemption.

Lewis-Holyfield II. It took 
place a week and a half ago. 
After a relatively boring 
Saturday morning and after-
noon as a UCSD student, I 
decided to spice things up for 
the evening by ordering the 
rematch between the defending 
heavyweight champion 
Evander Holyfield and the 
pompous, dread locked boxer 
from Great Britain, Lennox 
Lewis. 

Not having the opportunity 
to get my kicKS through other 
means, I had to settle for 
bringing this much-anticipat-
ed sporting event to my living 
room as the only type of enter-
tainment for the night. 

After being saturated with

Tritons Top Tournament Foes 
CHAMPS: With a come-from-behind victory in the finals, the Tritons win the Triton Tip-Off Tournament 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

After stumbling out of the 
starting blocks to begin the 1999 
season, the UCSD men's basket-
ball team bounced back by taking 
the 1999 UC San Diego Triton Tip-
Off Tournament. 

UCSO narrowly defeated the 
University of Redlands 83-80 to 
win the tournament at home on 
Saturday. 

"We play better every game," 
UCSD men's basketball coach 
Greg Lanthier said. "They have 
improved and they are getting 
confidence." 

It was a close game and UCSD 
had to put together a comeback to 
take the tourney. 

The Tritons quickly found 
themselves down 11-0 
before taking a shot. It 

Ahmad Russ scored 10 points, 
each leading their team to victory. 

The University of Redlands 
was led by Gordon Hunt who 
scored 21 points and Jon Allen 
who scored 14 and pulled down 
nine boards. 

"We're still at the point where 
we don't have a bench or a start-
ing team," Lanthier said. "We just 
don't know y,et. The players are 
pretty "equal. ' 

To get to the championship, 
the Tritons had to get by Cal State 
Hayward on Friday, who came 
into the tournament undefeated. 

The Tritons easily did just that. 
Despite a dismal .383 shooting 
percentage, UCSD downed the 
visitors, 74-66. 

Again it was a fine second-half 
defensive effort by UCSD, hold-
ing Hayward to a mere 30 

points. 
The bench got even worse as they 

fell behind 44-27, 
but UCSD 
regrouped.

Down by 12 heading 

into halftime, 50-38, the

30 second-half points. UCSD 
finally grabbed the lead with just 
48 seconds left and held on to win 
80-83. 

"We whittled the lead away," 
Lanthier said. "We had some big 
shots." ~ 

The Tritons were led by Sam 
Higgins, who tore up the net for 
21 points, aided by an impressive 
nine-for-nine free throw shooting 
performance. 

Poor second-half foul shooting 
is what did in Redlands. 

After being a perfect 8-8 at the 
charity stripe in the first half, 
Redlands went a dIsmal 4-9 in the 
second half. 

UCSD's Nick Christensen also 
had a big game, scoring 18 points 
while pulling down seven 
boards. Christensen went 4-6

Tritons as Ben Selby sc9red 11 
points while Cole Miller and

was Michael Martin, who scored 
12, and McMillian, who scored 
seven and had six rebounds while 
teammate Miller scored eight and 
rebounded four. 

Hayward was led by Darryl 
Walker, who had 12 points and 
dished out nine assists. Teammate 
Josh Jackson added nine points

For the University of Redlands

poor showing against the No. 4 
ranked University of Arizona, 
falling to the Wildcats 198-70. 
Northern Arizona does not field a 
men's team. 

"That's pretty much what is to 
be expected when you swim 
against the No. 2 team in the 
country," UCSD swim Coach Scot 
McGihon said. "They swim at a 
higher level. Their job is to swim 
and they get paid for it. Here, the 
priority is to go to school and 

then swim." is going though a tough period.
