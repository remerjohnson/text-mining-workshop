Members of the UC service-
worker union took to 
Library Walk Oct. 5 to protest 
salary cuts and layoffs 
implemented by the UC Board 
of Regents over the last several 
months. Demonstrators 
gathered in front of the 
Chancellor’s Complex, calling 
for the removal of UC President 
Mark G. Yudof.

Free tuition was the topic of 
discussion at a public meeting 
in the Visual Arts Facility Nov. 
2, where several dozen students, 
faculty and staff gathered to 
discuss the impending UC Board 

of Regents vote to 
increase student 
fees 32 percent.

The meeting 
featured a panel of 
speakers, followed 

by an open discussion on the 
feasibility of such a plan.

“I want to push for politics 
that are visionary — having our 
own demands,” UCSD alumna 
and event organizer Micha 
Cárdenas said. 

Cárdenas said she organized 

the forum in response to 
ongoing state budget cuts and 
corresponding reactions from the 
UC community, such as the Sept. 
24 systemwide walkout.

“I just don’t buy the rhetoric 
of the crisis,” Cárdenas said. “We 
should be lowering tuition. We’re 
not really limited to some kind 
of supply-and-demand system, 
where if someone said we had 
zero tuition, we would have 
higher taxes. I think it’s more 
complex than that.”

The panel consisted of ethnic 
studies associate professor 
Denise Ferreira da Silva, visual 
arts assistant professor Ricardo 
Dominguez, visual arts professor 
Fred Lonidier and A.S. Vice 
President of External Affairs 
Gracelynne West.

Panel members addressed the 
ways that the university’s rising 
tuition affects both students and 
the surrounding community.

“We have stories, we have 
families — we’re deeply impacted 

by these fee increases,” West said. 
According to Dominguez, 

the goal of the discussion was to 
reestablish the mission of the UC 
system.

“At its core, the forum is 
about reimagining the university 
beyond what it currently is, 
beyond what the UCOP and the 
regents framed the possibilities of 
the universities to be,” Dominguez 
said. “That’s a university that 
faces a complete privatization 
or a university for the people 
of California. Reimagining 
the university is about what is 
possible — what can be created as 
an alternative solution.”

Prior to the event, a letter 
discussing the possible concept 
of a free UC education was 
circulated on the Internet, much 
like recent letters written to the 
UC community by UC President 
Mark G. Yudof. The letter was 
composed by Dominguez and

SETBACK
The Grove Cafe’s grand reopening — originally scheduled for last week, 
following extensive renovations 
— was postponed after A.S. coun-
cilmembers realized the deadline 
was unrealistic given the scope 

of the proposed 
revamp.

A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta, who 
initated the Grove 
project after he was 
elected last spring, 
said the original 

Week Five projection was overly 
ambitious. 

Currently, the Grove is roughly 
$141,000 in debt — a figure that 
nearly drove last year’s outgoing 
council to shut down the student-
operated enterprise. Gupta ran his 
Spring Quarter presidential cam-
paign on a promise to revive the 
ailing cafe.

Though he originally planned 
to shut down the Grove during 
construction, Gupta — along 
with Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise operations Rishi Ghosh 
and Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Peter Benesch — now

The Rebecca and John Moores 
Cancer Center was awarded a $20 
million grant by the California 
Institute for Regenerative Medicine 
last week for the purpose of devel-
oping leukemia-fighting drugs.

CIRM’s 29-member governing 
board announced its decision to 
approve funding for the Moores 
Cancer Center, along with 13 other 
multidisciplinary teams, on Oct. 
28.

Though scientists currently 
have a greater understanding of the 
blood-forming cells that cause leu-
kemia than any other type of can-

cer-causing cells, they have not yet 
translated this knowledge into an 
effective treatment for the disease. 

Experimental results suggest 
it will soon be possible to destroy 
leukemia stem cells, using a drug 
or combination of drugs, while 
causing minimal damage to normal 
cells. 

UCSD’s research team will 
develop each of six existing mole-
cules that target leukemia stem cells 
— but not normal, blood-forming 
or hematopoietic stem cells — in 
an effort to find a potential cure. 
The molecules will be tested against 
both chronic and acute forms of 
leukemia.

The new grant marks the first 
CIRM funding effort expected to 
result in FDA approval for a clinical 
trial: Experts believe the research 
funded by the grant will result in 
an effective drug. 

The grant will fund research 
over a four-year period. The team 

of researchers will receive incre-
mental funding as it achieves mile-
stones set by the CIRM and CIRM’s 
international partners.

CIRM was created in 2004 with 
the passage of Proposition 71, 
which allocated $3 billion in bond 
money over a period of 10 years for 
embryonic stem-cell research and 
other biomedical studies. 

Including the latest leukemia 
research grant, the total amount of 
funds awarded by CIRM to UCSD 
is nearly $65.6 million since the 
institute’s inception in 2006.

“We are gratified to learn that 
CIRM once again has recognized 
the ingenuity, commitment and 
efforts of stem-cell scientists at UC 
San Diego Health Sciences, and 
provided them such generous sup-
port,” Vice Chancellor of Health 
Sciences and School of Medicine 
Dean David Brenner said in a state-
ment.

Moores Cancer Center Director 

Dennis A. Carson and cancer 
stem-cell research program direc-
tor Catriona Jamieson will lead the 
team of researchers.

“This award will fund a team 
— including researchers from dis-
parate disciplines and key industry-
academic partners — to develop 
novel therapies targeting leukemia 
stem cells, with the goal of mov-
ing to clinical trials in the shortest 
possible time frame,” Jamieson said. 
“Throughout California, scientists 
and physicians working in stem-cell 
research are keeping their eyes on 
the goal of getting these promising 
therapies to patients as quickly — 
and safely — as possible.”

The Moores Cancer Center will 
work in collaboration with John 
Dick, a leukemia stem-cell scientist 
at the University of Toronto, and 
his research team.

sjs001@ucsd.edu.

UCSD’s newly awarded 
funds bring total CIRM 
grant to nearly $65.6 
million since 2006.

NEWS� THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

plan to serve a limited menu of coffee 
and pastries while the refurbishments 
take place. The revamp will include a 
new deck, outdoor lighting, outdoor 
plug points for customers with lap-
tops, new indoor floor-
ing, kitchen upgrades 
including a $3,500 con-
veyer oven and a newly 
revised menu which will 
feature pizza and hot 
sandwiches. 

Ghosh said the Week 
Five projection was never 
concrete, and therefore 
the project is not techni-
cally behind schedule.

“It wasn’t a realistic 
deadline to begin with, 
and it was kind of vague 
with the intention that when we tell 
people, it will make them work harder 
and faster,” Ghosh said. “Realistically, 
we’re on track, but realistically we’re 
not going to open for a little while.”

According to Gupta, however, the 
project is indeed behind schedule  — 
due in part to an overly optimistic 
deadline and the failure to consider 
outside factors, which he said have 
slowed the process.

“We were ambitious at setting the 
deadline for fifth week,” Gupta said.

University Centers recently agreed 
to fund outdoor patio renovations, 
along with half the cost of the cafe’s 
electrical rewiring. However, Gupta 
said the university’s funding proce-
dures are slowing the project.

“It is definitely taking longer than 
we hoped for the renovations to be 
completed,” Gupta said. “It takes a 
lot longer to go through University 
Centers than we believed, in terms of 
getting the deck repaired.”

Also delaying the project, accord-
ing to Gupta, is a lack of enthusiasm 
from university officials for his pro-

posal that the cafe accept meal points.
“That is a delay that we weren’t 

expecting, in that Mark Cunningham, 
— the Director of Housing and Dining 
— is telling us ‘No,’” Gupta said.

According to Gupta, if students 
were to dine at the 
Grove using meal 
points, food items 
would be more expen-
sive than if students 
paid with cash — creat-
ing a larger profit for 
the university. He said 
he doesn’t understand 
why university officials 
are unwilling to coop-
erate. 

Gupta added that 
the date of the cafe’s 
grand reopening is not 

of great importance.
“Honestly, a couple weeks here 

and there aren’t going to make a 
long-term difference,” he said. “But 
what will make a long-term differ-
ence is if we can do everything right 
the first time. That’s what we’re most 
concerned with.”

However, Ghosh said he doesn’t 
expect the Grove to reopen until 
sometime next quarter, with an exact 
date still uncertain.

“It will be a surprise, so that the 
marketing is all in one phase and so 
everyone gets it at the same time,” 
Ghosh said. “Also, so no one knows 
what they can get there.”

There will be a two-week mar-
keting campaign targeting students 
before the opening, including flyers 
and free food. 

“We’re going to have a wave of 
marketing two weeks in advance 
so you will know when it happens,” 
Ghosh said.

$2.3 million for undergraduate scholarships since 1996 - THANK YOU!

With the cancellation of next week’s council meeting due to Veteran’s Day, A.S. 
councilmembers debated for an exces-
sively lengthy amount of time regard-
ing an allocation of funds for various 
access and affordability initiatives.

The meeting started off on a rocky 
note as Stephan Kemper, President 
of Triton 
Engineering 
Student Council, 
protested the 
treatment of his 
engineering con-
stituents during 
public input. The 
issue was regard-
ing a former engineering senator who 
traveled to India, and the fact that the 
council did not appoint anyone to fill 
that position until past the standard 15 
standing academic days.

“The lethargy of the president has 
led to this council meeting six times 
without hearing the voice from the 
engineering community,” Kemper said. 
“This is a specific act of injustice…I’m 
appalled that students are not repre-
sented.”

During his report, President Utsav 
Gupta responded indirectly to the 
accusations made by Kemper.

“I don’t think there was anything 
wrong with the process; we’re looking 
at academic division councils in gen-
eral in the standing rules,” Gupta said.

After some debate over whether or 
not the appointment bills of the new 
senators should be considered sepa-
rately or as a whole, the council voted 
to close the meeting. After about five 
minutes, all who were not members of 
the council were allowed to return to 
the meeting. Councilmembers voted 
to appoint new transfer senator Adam 
Powers and freshmen senators Kevin 
Hoang, Thao Pham and Mariah 
Valentine.

As a council project, several coun-
cilmembers, including Gupta, worked 
towards creating a UCSD Sleep-In 
Protest the night before the Nov. 17-19 
UC Regents meeting at UCLA. 

“I think they strategically made it at 
7 a.m. so that students wouldn’t want 
to go to UCLA that early,” campuswide 
senator Wafa Ben Hassine said.

Committee 
members stated 
their main goal: 
to gather an 
anticipated 200 
students to flood 
the regents’ public 
comment period 
with personal 

testimonials. 
Gupta made a motion to move the 

allocation of funds for the sleep-in 
protest to new business, since next 
Wed.’s meeting is cancelled.

Councilmembers went off on tan-
gent after tangent, bringing up rather 
irrelevant issues such as the funding 
of food, to the original motion, which 
was to move the order to new busi-
ness. 

They questioned the validity of 
breaking solidarity with UCLA, as 
UCLA already planned transportation 
and housing for the night. Some coun-
cilmembers didn’t feel comfortable 
funding over $2,000 for food for the 
sleep-in protest.

Campuswide senator Adam 
Kenworthy summed up the debate 
succinctly.  

“We are splitting the council by 
deciding where the money is going to 
go,” Kenworthy said. “This is stupid, 
guys…I don’t want to sit around and 
decide how this event is going to be 
planned out when its two weeks away. 
We need to decide how much money 
we need to allocate now.” 

After another half hour of discus-
sion, $6,000 was allocated for the event.

Cárdenas, among others.
“We will seek to create an 

educational and research vision 
for a UC [system] that will offer 
free access for all those who wish 
to have higher education in our 
communities,” the letter said.

Dominguez said the letter was 
confused by some reciepients as an 
official letter released by the UC 
Office of the President.

“We had e-mails from the LA 
Times and bloggers and tweeters 
out there,” Dominguez said. “For 
at least a moment, the circuit 
was disrupted. It allowed another 
possibilty to occur — and that's 
to reimagine what the university 
can be.”

Lonidier added that significant 
political action would have to be 
taken in order for UC students to 
receive a free education.

“In the '60s and '70s, there were 
massive student movements that 
produced things like affirmative 
action,” Lonidier said. “A lot 
was pushed onto the university 
by students. There has to be a 
challenge to the institution that it 
takes seriously, and that requires 
numbers.”

While event organizers said 
that such a system would take a 
number of years to devise and 
implement, supporters of free 
tuition see the event as the first 
step toward their goal.

“It is just a beginning that we 
think is worth starting rather than 
just sitting around,” Dominguez 
said.

fident that no student has ever even 
heard of a little something called 
LimeWire, it sure would’ve been 
helpful to receive more than just a 
jargony e-mail warning us that no 
message is safe from the Recording 
Industry Association of America’s 
preying eyes.

But of course, it’s painstakingly 
obvious that — when it comes to 
communication between the UC and 
its students — being real with us is 
never in the university’s best interest. 

In fact, the fruition of our new 
e-mail policy is based on nothing but 
a few higher-ups’ desires. 

The Aug. 2005 communications 
policy redraft stated 
that because uni-
versity policies are 
often based on fed-
eral or state laws, the 
UC would model its 
own basic rules on 
those of the state. 

So the UC Board of Regents com-
plied with state law, instating a new 
systemwide policy that each campus 
would have to incorporate into its 
own community rulebook.

The message was passed down to 
then-Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Marsha Chandler, who 
established a committee to create 
the policy in 2006. Three meetings 
and an obligatory two-month com-
ment period later, the policy passed 

with barely any notice or opposi-
tion. 

Why wasn’t Chandler slapping 
flyers all over Price Center and pick-
eting the potentially 
invasive policy? Why 
didn’t she stand up 
against the man and ask 
for student representa-
tion on the committee? 
It’s an injustice, after all, 
to let anyone just rifle 
through our incriminat-
ing Facebook notifica-
tions like it’s nobody’s 
business.

Oh, yeah — she 
works for the man. And 
at the end of the day, Chandler and 
the gang are just trying to get their 
jobs done without rousing a new 
batch of Library Walk protestors.

So what’s the moral of the story? 
Students must be the watchdogs for 
both their (potentially illegal) infor-
mation and the university’s endless 
list of sneaky committees — always 
and forever, until the end of time.

We’ll be the first to admit that 
we screwed up by letting this policy 
fly beneath our noses (it probably 
fell through the cracks somewhere 

between covering the 
SRTV porn scandal 
and dancing through 
the most epic Sun God 
Festival of all time), but 
that doesn’t mean there 
aren’t still dangerous 
policies drifting around 
that we can intercept 
before it’s too late.

The regents passed 
a nonaffiliate speech 
policy, for example, 
which essentially pre-

vents those who are not connected 
to the university from voicing their 
opinions on UC campuses. UCSD is 
currently adapting said policy — an 
excellent opportunity for students 
to play a role in one of these shady 
committees.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta said 
he’s working to change the e-mail 
policy, though it’s unclear if he 

can convince Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul Drake to start 
from scratch just for the sake of stu-
dent input.

If Gupta can do it, more power 
to him. In the meantime, watch your 
e-mails and keep your eyes peeled 
for drastic policy changes dressed in 
administrator-speak — they’re more 
common than you think.

There was a time in the not-so-distant past that text messag-ing was strictly the domain 
of stranded middle-schoolers who 
wanted 2 kno when Alex’s mom wud 
pick them up from the movies. 

Character after painstaking char-
acter could only be hashed out on 
Nokia brick phones with such infu-
riating torpidity that it would have 
been unthinkable to break out the 
bone-softening keypad any more than 
was absolutely necessary. 

Fast-forward five years and 
one awkward adolescent bow-out, 
and texting has morphed into our 
preferred mode of communication 
— useful for a myriad of purposes, 
including (but not limited to) insta-
gossip, late-night booty calls and 
Mexican horoscope alerts.

Yet the flurry of LOLs and bracket 
emoticons whizzing through phone 
towers across the nation reveals a sad 
new reality: Few know how to work 
the 160-character limit to its full 
potential. 

And the afternoon after a defin-
ing Friday-night number swap, every 
unspoken word counts.

First off, timing is everything. 
Tempting as the prospect may be, do 
not — even if you believe yourself to 
be employing the soundest morning-
after logic in the history of the sport 
— reach for your iPhone upon the 
first rays of Saturday sun, attempting 
to make good on a drunken promise 
to “stay in touch.” 

Desperation is a virus easily iden-
tified over cellular airwaves. Even 
on the off-chance that your new text 
interest is divinely destined to be the 
love of your life, a premature message 
airs the fact that you are both eager 
and available — two qualities sur-
passed only by cargo pants and body 
acne on the grand scale of all things 
unsexy. 

Instead, adhere to a strict 24-hour 
rule. Waiting a full day before send-
ing an ultra-witty flirtext will disguise 
your eagerness beneath a noncha-
lance so thick, not even the German 
Shepherds of hopeful conquests could 
catch a whiff of your fragrant longing. 

Waiting a day gives the object of 
your desire time to sweat it out a little 
— and, with any luck, strike up the 
desperation himself. 

But remember, surpassing the ill-
fated initial error of jumping the gun 
does not — I repeat, does not — give 
you free reign to spit out burning 
unanswered questions (“So, do U care 
if the curtains match the drapes??”) at 
your every whim. Never undervalue 
keyboard restraint; it is as instrumen-
tal in crowding your Asia Hall Twin-
XL on Friday night as in finding 
short-lived electronic love. 

Try not to get too down in cor-
respondence downtime. Ultimately, 
most people who are worth your 
precious inbox space also lead full 
lives — so if your proposition for 
afternoon coffee (or, more transpar-
ently, late-night homework help) goes 
unanswered for an hour or two, do 
not jump to the tempting conclusion 
that you are an undesirable, unworthy 
ogre. 

Even more important, resist the 

Afew short months ago, the A.S. Council devoted nearly 15 hours of discussion to a 
nasty little problem called the Grove 
Cafe. 

The 25-year-old student-
run enterprise had accrued over 
$140,000 in debt, and wasn’t showing 
much sign of making a turnaround. 
Several councilmembers led a vocal 
charge to shut down the belea-
guered cafe once and for all — a 
move designed to cut the council’s 
losses and hand the Grove’s glen-like 
Student Center location over to the 
university. 

But through a tearful mix of opti-
mism and nostalgia and a heartfelt 
pledge from incoming president 
Utsav Gupta to revive the ailing 
enterprise, the vote to close the 
Grove was overturned and the cof-
feehouse lived to see another day. 

Kind of.
The cafe is currently operating at 

partial capacity, having eliminated 
nearly its entire food menu in prepa-
ration for what Gupta and friends 
promise to be a heckuva 
grand reopening — 
one complete with a 
revamped menu, a fresh 
coat of paint and a big 
old publicity campaign 
courtesy of those weirdo 
A.S. artists who seem 
to like teddy bears so 
much.

And while these 
rather ambitious plans 
have already been 
derailed pretty heavily 
— a proposed fifth week 

reopening quickly dissolved into 
“we’ll get back to you on that one” 
— it’s nice to see that something 
is actually happening down at the 

Grove. For starters, Gupta 
and his motley troupe of 
would-be restaurateurs 
recently secured full 
funding from the univer-
sity to replace the cafe’s 
rickety, Civil War-era 
patio. 

What’s more, they’re 
actually taking time to 
meet with the cafe’s stu-
dent managers, a far cry 
from the stubborn apathy 
demonstrated by last 
year’s councilmembers, 

many of whom had never ventured 
past the sterile confines of their 
Price Center East stronghold, much 
less frolicked their way through the 
flowery Ewok village that conceals 
the Grove. 

Yes, things are actually starting 
to look up for the little cafe that 
couldn’t. There’s a solid team of dev-
otees working toward what appears 
to be a solid collection of new, mon-
ey-generating ideas. But let’s not get 
too wrapped up in buckets of praise 
just yet. Though the year is still 
young, the clock is already ticking. 
Before long, Spring Quarter is going 
to roll around and a new council will 
arrive, with new priorities — and 
there’s no guarantee that the Grove 

will be among them. 
So, Gupta and team Grove-love 

better act fast if they want to get this 
thing off the ground, and they bet-
ter do it right, or else that longtime 
financial sinkhole of a cafe is just 
going to slide right back into the red. 

Eventually we hope to see a suc-
cessful Grove, one that actually makes 
money for the students who own it 
rather than collecting debt, dust and 
the wrath of fed-up councilmembers. 
In the meantime, we’re left with a 
powerful hankering for Cali Clubs 
and the lingering fear that Gupta’s 
band of merry enterprisers are going 
to lose momentum, give up or just 
outright fail. It’s time to start throw-
ing back those espresso shots, lads.

 What is law school?
       A place where convention is reinforced?

 Or more than that?
      A place to learn a broad repertoire of skills.

    A rigorous curriculum in a supportive environment.

       An intersection of theory and practice.

 Explore the full potential of the law

              in a school devoted to the big picture.

urge to follow up with an asinine 
question to force a response — or 
worse, “u there???” There is always a 
reason for unresponsiveness (be it a 
preoccupying bio midterm or your 
own repulsiveness), so — as daunt-
ing a task as waiting it out may be — 
doing so will create the invaluable, 
if faulty, illusion that you have a life 
beyond this budding text romance. 

Once conversation starts to flow, 
drafting more substantial messages 
— the greatest test of all — hinges 
on whether your audience is more 
interested in how your Anthro paper 
went or what you’re wearing. Luckily, 
there are a couple universal rules of 
composition to guide any straying 

keystrokes back to the herd. 
First: Unless there’s at least a 

small tinge of irony, LOL is unac-
ceptable. The default should be 
“haha,” and only in response to 
something with genuine comedic 
worth — but action acronyms with 
’90s chat-room roots are almost 
always out of the question. 

Second: meticulously scribed 
though they may secretly be, your 
texts should come off as effortless. 
Evidently carefree composition can 
be achieved by purposely exclud-
ing apostrophes, capital letters or 
even question marks. The goal here, 
again, is to create the illusion of non-
chalance. 

Of course, you’ll eventually have 

to transcend the comfort of the key-
pad to benefit from any kind of more 
gratifying oral contact. No serious 
conversation should ever take place 
through a medium once reserved for 
Alex’s mom and newly relegated to 
booty calls and small-talk. 

But if you can make the very 
specimen whose Facebook you’ve 
spent the better part of 48 hours 
scrutinizing believe that you have 
better things to do than craft the 
perfect creeper text, give yourself a 
pat on the back: you get the official 
texting guru’s gold asterisk, and bet-
ter yet, are one step closer to some 
midnight “hw help.”

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana

Dear Editor, 
I would like to offer some clari-

fication to the Guardian’s Oct. 22 
news feature entitled “Lit Building 
Cancer Investigation Inconclusive” 
on the status of the health concerns 
regarding the Literature Building:

1) While it is impossible to link 
electromagnetic field levels defini-
tively to the breast cancer cases, the 
EMF level associated with the eleva-
tors was a reasonable initial cause for 
concern given the elevators’ unusual 
setup.

2) The difficulty in finding a 
specific cause for the high incidence 
of breast cancer in the Literature 
Building has to do with the very 
nature of epidemiological research: 
that research requires large numbers 
to generate reliable data.

3)The administration, in con-
sultation over the summer with the 
Chair and Vice Chair of the UCSD 
Academic Senate and the Literature 
Building Committee, proposed the 
five cited mitigating actions includ-

ing a study of the possible presence 
of toxins.

4) UCSD’s Office of 
Environmental Health and Safety 
stated that the National Institute 
for Occupational Health and Safety 
(NIOSH) did not have all the data 
when it did its study, which cast 
doubt on its relevance.

5) The Office of Environmental 
Health and Safety, not the Literature 
Department, hired Ninyo & Moore 
to perform a chemical trace analysis 
study (through rigorous air sam-
pling) of the building.

T
he silent 
somber of 
the new-
est exhibit 
at the 
University 
Art Gallery 
hits you 

right on your first step into the 
room. A ghost made of white 
silk hangs from the ceiling. A 
video loop shows Yoko Ono’s 
clothes being cut from her body. 
Each piece in Off the Beaten 
Path: Violence Against Women 
is heavy and demanding, refus-
ing to be a backdrop to our idle 
chatter. Unsurprisingly, any 
desire for discussion soon fades 
over visuals of domestic oppres-
sion and metaphorical flowers 
symbolizing female genital 
mutilation.

A careful selection of mixed 
media — including tiny beaded 
figurines, brightly colored 
feather-dresses, enormous 
broom structures and Icelandic 
statutes — gives tremendous 
variety to a specifically feminist 
statement. The national and eth-
nic diversity among the artists 
(who come from Sweden, South 
Africa, Iceland, Colombia, Egypt 
and everywhere in between) is a 
constant reminder that violence 
against women is ubiquitous and 
global. 

The exhibit is divided into 
four sections. Each division 
is sectioned off, given its own 
informative blurb printed in 
bold, crisp black print on the 
white walls. Permutations of 
violence range from the expect-
ed (Violence and the Family) 
to the more obscure/abstract 
(Violence and Politics, Violence 
and Culture, Violence and the 
Individual).

Although the textual intros 
are meant to convey the press-
ing urgency of the issues inside, 
overly dramatic language 
sometimes does deter from the 
meaning — much more aptly 
conveyed by the art itself. An 
apparent claim that “false laugh-
ter ringing through the halls of a 
high school” constitutes violence 
against women in the same 
way as a bloody domestic dis-
turbance — albeit on a smaller 
scale — undermines the overall 
message of the exhibit into 
something overwrought. 

But we soon forget all about 
words. South Korean artist Jung 
Junyeob’s installation paints 
gray, filmy silhouettes of women 
onto large panels of silk hanging 
from the ceiling, meant to repre-
sent indistinct and anonymous 
female forms. Indeed, the sheer 
enormity of the looming panels 
make it near impossible to dis-
cern actual human shapes — the 
women therein turn more to 
gray brush strokes than living, 
breathing persons. Their thin 
cloth sways with the breeze, giv-
ing the impression of delicate, 
weak curtains on a canopy bed 
— ethereal and unimportant. 

Immediately beyond the 
silhouettes are videos by the 
famous (or infamous, if you 
like) Yoko Ono. Two moni-
tors facing each other display 
variations of the same perfor-
mance filmed nearly 40 years 
apart — in 1965 and 2003. In 
the video piece, appropriately 
named “Cut,” Ono sits on stage 
in a simple black dress while 
people walk up to her with scis-
sors and cut off various parts of 
her dress. For all its avant-garde 
pretentiousness, the piece does 
exude a sense of constrained 

desperation as Ono attempts to 
remain still and composed. The 
videos are soundless, played on 
small, grainy black-and-white 
monitors. The installation’s 
understated nature — alongside 
the gallery’s bigger, flashier dis-
plays of violence — heighten its 
melancholy into a sort of claus-
trophobic helplessness.

From a different Yoko — 
Yoko Inoue of Japan — comes 
an untitled piece, the same one 
plastered on San Diego-wide 
advertisements for the exhibit. 
In a blurry photograph domi-
nated by shades of yellow and 
red, a half-naked young woman 
holds up an enormous, shiny 
metal pot that obscures her fig-
ure from nose to waist. 

The subject’s eyes, the only 
distinct part of her form, peer 
at her audience from behind 
the kitchenware, imbibing more 
power into the symbolism of 
the gigantic brass vessel: both 
an instrument of protection 
against domestic violence and a 
reminder of the society in which 
a woman would need this type 
of protection. 

Juxtaposed among the gener-
ally enormous installations and 
paintings is a simple beaded fig-
urine by American artist Joyce 
J. Soctt, ominously named “Day 
After Rape, Darfur I.” The dark 
foot-long woman is constructed 
from the same seeds and crude 
materials a kindergartner would 
fiddle with in an art class, but is 
lifted into a very adult realm of 
understanding, artfully twisted 
into a painful and horrific pose, 
dripping in beads of blood. 
Minimal facial details and 
simple lines make the figurine

O happy happy holidays, how gosh-darn much could I possibly love thee? Let me count the gay ol’ 
ways. Um, Jack-O-Lanterns! Over-
priced candles in ribbons, smelling 
of baby bottoms and burnt Pine Sol! 
Bunchy-ass twinkle lights to squeeze all 
Mother Earth’s tree-beings into random 
strangled balls of spineless bush!

Even better: stupid twisted blue-
icicle ones that never quite span the 
veranda! Nah, but I adore the stuff. I 
guess I just also have a thing for putting 
evil adjectives before all the wonderful 
ways we find to light the winter. 

(And to all those who already sat 
through the last holiday column — a 
mid-October Christmas music vs. 
weird new Flaming Lips album inner 
conflict — sorry guys. I promise I’m 
not a Macy’s Day rep planted here to 
brainwash you out of your “corporate 
joy” conspiracy theories. I guess these 5 
p.m. sunsets and crazy-cozy mist storms 
must have wriggled into all the holes I 
poked in my brain this Halloween week-
end, forcing the e-tard in me to care 
exclusively about soft things and sea-
sonal comforts. And just when I thought 
I was back on the road to cool. Brain 
podcast: pumpkin-spice ice cream! 
Eggnog latte! Tail of a bush bunny!)

There’s only one thing crappy about 
the big-red-bow gateway to the holidays 
we stand beneath this young November 
morn: Too soon, it will all be over. Life’s 
most indulgent months are like a long 
reckless weekend ahead, hung in gray 
dread of that schleppy, 21-unit January 
mud puddle waiting patiently in our 
certain failure of a future like the ugliest 
fucking Monday we ever saw.

For this reason, the earliest holidays 
are always the best. Well, Halloween 
is kind of just an autumn outsider to 
the lovey-dovey winter circle, but it’s 
got its own official colors and enough 
paraphernalia to take up two aisles in 
the Vons home-living department. And, 
more practically, lets us shake any last 
traces of summer shitshow before the 
curtain lifts for lovely snowflake pag-
eant, lest they rear their ugly parts at the 
office Christmas party. (OK, fine, I just 
wish I went to office Christmas parties.

FILMREVIEWS

C aught in the middle of a long, deadly competition with the Soviets, the U.S. Army turned 
to the only logical solution: psychic 
warfare. And yes, that’s exactly what 
it sounds like.

Based on a nonfiction book by 
British journalist Jon Ronson, “The 
Men Who Stare at Goats” plays out 
the bizarre account — from concep-
tion to destruction to LSD-laden 
resurrection — of an army unit that 
specialized in paranormal combat. 
Equipped with an inherently mag-
netic plot and star-studded cast, 
director Grant Heslov had his hands 
on a filmmaking gold mine. But with

T rees drown in mist. Silence. Acorns fall like gunfire on the roof of the cabin …
Holy shit, is that deer walking 

around with a stillborn hanging out of 
its uterus?

Cannes winner “Antichrist” is 
hit-and-run horror at its best: gut-
churning stillness punctuated by 
unbelievably disturbing imagery, all 
to the tune of dead noise.

It’s hard to respect director Lars 
von Trier when the first five minutes 
revolve around Willem Dafoe screw-
ing his wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg), 
while their 2-year-old falls from a 
second-story window. It gets harder 
still, when the couple sinks into the 
irritatingly archetypal roles of rational 
man and superstitious woman. 

To be frank, most 
of “Antichrist” is ste-
reotyped and dull. The 
characters, insipidly 
christened He and 
She, spend the first 
hour of the film in 
exposure therapy at a 
sinister cabin called 
Eden — an attempt by 
husband-knows-best 
to cure his nympho-
maniac wife of her fear of nature. As 
the pair slips into Eden’s madness, the 
hackneyed tropes roll out en masse. 
The only thing keeping the movie 
interesting are the many glimpses 
into von Trier’s twisted mind, making 
the end product little more than a 
failed homage to B-movies. 

Try to resist the urge to bail 
though, because the last half hour 
is batshit insane, shattering every 
rule from decency to the Geneva 
Conventions. “Antichrist” provoked 
nasty arguments at Cannes over its 
misogyny and sexualized violence, 

and there’s no question that von Trier 
wasn’t messing around. You’ll find 
yourself reaching down to make sure 
everything’s still there.

While von Trier forces us to sit 
through an hour-long sexist’s wet 
dream with feeble suspense and 
close-ups of Dafoe’s shaft, he brings 
it all together in the end. The twist is 
sharp, but because of the prolonged 
buildup, it’s as believable as a roadside 
collision. 

The wilderness setting may be cli-
che, but it provides the perfect mise-
en-scène when the shit hits the fan. A 
character in itself, the forest sits pant-

ing in the background, tongue lolling 
over canines, and staring you down 
as you leave the theater in disbelief.

Of course, not everyone will 
have the willpower to reach that 
end. Though Dafoe and Gainsbourg 
are experts at their craft, neither 
character is worth any attention at 
first. He is paternal and holier-than-
thou; she is scared and hollow. But 
those with enough endurance to 
wait out the storm will be rewarded. 
Von Trier goes where most direc-
tors are too afraid to tread, stripping 
away every layer of normative social 
conduct and offering humanity’s 
inherent lunacy free reign. It’s not 
for the faint of heart, but when your 
pulse finally slows, you’ll see that 
he’s birthed a hell of a compelling 
monstrosity.

8�THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2009� HIATUS

generic and thus universal, repre-
senting each of so many women 
affected by Darfur.

One of the exhibition’s few male 
artists, Hank Willis Thomas, deliv-
ers his own lesson in gender roles. 
An image titled “Are You The Right 
Kind of Woman For It?” looks to be 
a vintage magazine advertisement 
targeting a black audience, but all 
branding has been digitally removed. 
The original image beneath reveals 
the various ways in which women 
are “used” by the media, according to 
Thomas: A haughty black man casu-
ally seated among fruit baskets and 
plants is flanked by two women, one 
crouching seductively with her hand 
over his knee in a form-fitting striped 
dress, the other on his lap in a tight 
red dress. His statement is simple 
enough: The real commodity here is 
a beautiful woman in revealing cloth-
ing, portrayed in the advertisement as 
life’s fruit for the plucking.

Walking in to the exhibit may be 
mollifying, but walking out leaves a 
feeling of empowerment. The very 
presence of “Off the Beaten Path” on 
campus — part of the Art Works for 
Change initiative — brings us closer 
to a world of artistic thought with 
a clear grasp on these worldwide 
issues of violence against women, as 
well as a desire to fight it.

The exhibit will be on display 
until Dec. 12, coinciding with a 
series of talks about violence and 
culture taking place on campus dur-
ing the month of November — the 
next of which will be held Nov. 14 at 
6 p.m. in Pepper Canyon Hall.

Or had cousins under 30.)
So Halloween is only pregame, and 

Christmas/New Year’s are so far along 
in the season of silver bells they inevi-
tably ring of the end. Which brings 
us to the fourth week of November: 
a night for ugly sweaters and savory 
forkfulls ’til our stomachs explode in 
gluttonous delight. Thanksgiving is the 
perfect middle man — the pinnacle of 
everything lovable about the holidays.

So why do the other h-days get all 
the songs? Halloween’s long ridden on 
“Thriller,” and no good man can deny 
himself a gangly romp to “Monster 
Mash.” Even that far-off February 
hour of love and gouda is tributed by 
Andre 3000’s delectably literal “Happy 
Valentine’s Day.” Maybe that’s it: All 
the great respected musical artists out 
there (yawn) can’t figure out a way to 

twist mashed potatoes into a swoony 
metaphor.

Little do they know, the greatest 
opportunity for immortalization is 
staring up from the pool of green-
bean butter. However, if there’s one 
modern superstar fearless in the face 
of clunky, shallow details, it’s diva of 
my dreams Rufus Wainwright — the 
man for the job, I’m sure of it. Maybe 
it’s just my own fuzzy-wuzzy ties with 
Wainwright that jet-plane me back 
home every time I hear his monotone 
opera ringing in the rafters. But think 
about it: He’s a Starbucks tradition 
but also a sensitive we-didn’t-rape-
and-pillage Canadian — to eliminate 
that little knot of guilt in our stomach 
where more grits should go — and 
a lover of all things superfluous. 
He chose to set his new live album, 
Milwaukee at Last!!!, in the midwest, 

and gave it three exclamation points 
to boot. He gives our sins a golden-
boy glow and all the finest-silver 
glamour of a 1950s musical.

Plus, he’s got a full-leaf dinner-
table of relatives to back him: Kate 
McGarrigle in her country skirts, 
and Daddy Loudon to bust out that 
charming “Rufus is a Tit Man” num-
ber for some fun-lovin’, down-home 
rosy cheeks in front of the new male 
friend. And Martha would surely lend 
a couple perfect verses on the grand 
marmalade mess that must be the age-
old Wainwright cranberry sauce.

So I’ll spin Milwaukee this year, 
but eventually, Rufus, I want a real 
Thanksgiving album, and I want a line 
detailing Gammy’s fingers wriggling 
the grease and thyme up under some 
good-and-raw, fresh-plucked Turkey 
skin. Hell yes. Little Saint who?

the film to fulfilling its justifiably high 
expectations. 

The bizarre tale of the New Earth 
Army — the U.S. military’s para-
normal warfare unit — is unwound 
by Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), a 
dejected reporter from Ann Arbor 
who, at the start of the film, is crushed 
when his wife leaves him for his edi-
tor. Lacking purpose in his life, Wilton 
ships out to Iraq to cover the war, but 
gets stuck in Kuwait. There, he meets 
Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a 
washed-up ex-Jedi Master (aka psy-
chic soldier) who claims to be on a 
secret mission for the U.S. Army. 

The two characters venture into 
Iraq together, and Wilton soon finds 
that Cassady’s “secret mission” is really 
a quest for redemption for — you 
guessed it — staring at a goat and kill-
ing it. After a series of ridiculous mis-
fortunes, including being kidnapped 
by a group of militant Iraqis, Cassady 
finds himself back alongside mentor 
and New Earth Army founder Bill 
Django (Jeff Bridges) and old nemesis 
Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) with an 
opportunity to clear his conscience.  

Clooney shines in his ingenious 
depiction of the uber-confident 
Cassady, who remains firmly con-
vinced of his supernatural powers 
through most of the movie. His belief 
is only partly justified — Cassady 
successfully breaks apart clouds in 
the sky with his mind while failing 
to foresee a giant rock in the road, 
which he subsequently crashes into. 
The film lives and dies by Cassady, 
thriving at the character’s high points 
and diving headfirst into a bucket of 
cheesiness when he finds himself in 
a pool of self-doubt. Wilton might 
as well be another audience member 

— McGregor’s reactions to Cassady’s 
antics almost precisely mirror the 
faces of everyone in the theatre — 
making his character unnecessary and 
bland. To be fair, McGregor didn’t 
have much to work with script-wise; 
the reporter’s back-story is razor 
thin — possibly because he is the only 
completely fictionalized main charac-
ter — and Wilton is used exclusively 
as a vehicle to get Cassady’s story out.

Packed with A-list male actors, 
“Goats” surprisingly avoids enter-
ing the realm of romance entirely. 
However, instead of proving a refresh-
ing change to the norm, the lack of 
female characters further exposes the 
film’s distinct complexity deficit. Not 
even a hilarious, goat-killing psychic 
Clooney can distract from the fact 
that there are no other facets of the 
plot to focus on. 

Even with a bare storyline, “The 
Men Who Stare at Goats” consistently 
keeps you laughing out loud at the 
interactions between Cassady, Wilton 
and Django, never taking itself too 
seriously. Instead of wasting time on 
Wilton’s internal debate about the 
trueness of Cassady’s paranormal abili-
ties, the film leaves the analyzing up to 
the audience, creating more space for 
Clooney’s shenanigans. And of course, 
more screen time for the goats.

I t was almost 4 a.m. at Burning Man, and the night was turning delirious. Peering out of his monkey costume with huge eyes, my friend grabbed my hand and said, “We’re 
about to see Bassnectar. Are you ready to feel the wobbles?”

The what? When we entered the pulsing tent, it hit me like 
a brick wall. The speakers threw out a bass line so heavy, the 
vibrations in the air around us were more intense than the 
sound. WOB WOB WOB. They were felt.

A month after burning the man, Bassnectar — San 
Francisco deejay/mix-meister Lorin Ashton — has released 
Cozza Frenzy. While nothing can replace the sensory inten-
sity of a live show, the unbelievably thick bass on Ashton’s 
latest makes it impossible not to get raucous. And a good 
sound system (in other words, not your laptop) is enough to 
make you forget you’re not there in person.

A self-described mixture of dubstep, electro, hip-hop, 
dirty digital, bass-heavy music, Bassnectar goes more bizarre 
than ever on Cozza Frenzy. The deejay throws in dashes of 
creepy circus music and recorded giggles, playing a mean-
dering game of hide-and-seek with your senses — fading in 
and out and gradually drawing up to mind-blowing crescen-
dos. The album alternates heavy-hitting thumpers with mel-
low tracks like “Window Seat” and “I Wish I Was a Hipster, 
well-timed breaks from the nonstop bass attack.

Each track stands stark from the next: An upbeat and to-
the-point “Boombox” rockets the album out of its packaging, 
while “Cozza Frenzy” and “Are You Ready” are more than 
enough amp for the wild night ahead (and may even inspire 
interpretive dance). A final two remixes bleed euphoria and, 
along with the ghostly “Before We Dissolve,” are enough to 
make a jellyfish of you. And most definitely feel the wobbles.

Ashton Takes Us Where the Wobbles Are

H allelujah! Praise the gods of alt-rock: Julian Casablancas — the prodigal savior — has returned. Frontman of millennium sensation the Strokes, Casablancas has finally followed in his 
mates’ footsteps and produced side project Phrazes for the Young. 
For all the dark clouds of mediocrity that were Nickel Eye, Little 
Joy and Albert Hammond Jr., Phrazes is the silver lining.

If you want to get super technical, this LP is basically an 
upbeat, double-speed version of a Strokes album, not helped by 
Casablancas’ distinctive voice. Borrowing disco-pop beats, a few 
synths and a positive attitude, the artist weaves his jams with 
dance, boister and genuine fun. Having eight solid, full-length 
cuts rather than 15 short ones was an excellent decision, vastly 
upping the quality and nuance of every track.

Lyrics are a different story, though, dragging his sweet sound 
with the melancholy of a thousand Debbie Downers. In lead-off 
single “11th Dimension,” Casablancas gets as political as he’s 
ever been, calling out America for its shady backroom dealings. 
“Forgive them/ Even if they are not sorry,” Jesus — ahem — 
Julian croons, which may be a tad more difficult for us unwashed 
heathens, as we aren’t all as holy as thou. 

For a nice, chill change of pace, “4 Chords of the Apocalypse” 
showcases Casablancas’ soulful preacher pipes, further embel-
lishing blatant religious undertones and imparting a wisdom that 
would normally require years of bible study. But J. Cass has been 
to the “11th Dimension,” up and down the country-fried weird-
ness that’s “Ludlow St.” and through the paranoid stutter-rock of 
“River of Brakelights.” That unwashed heap of hair isn’t merely 
for looks — it’s concealing a gigantic brain. Dang.

So even if we can’t have a new Strokes record until each mem-
ber gets his panties out of a twist, Phrazes for the Young is the 
next best thing. And it’s righteous as they come.

Jules Imparts Hedonist Wisdom on Young

W ith group mastermind Rivers Cuomo penning tunes for the likes of Katy Perry and busting out uninspired renditions of “Poker Face,” is it any surprise that Weezer’s new Raditude sounds like a 
Lady Gaga B-side?

Let’s be honest: Raditude isn’t deep on any level. It’s not personal; it’s 
not complicated; it’s dumb party-rock so predictable you can call a line 
two tracks before Cuomo sings it. But damn, is it fun. 

In fact, Raditude is an ode to all the classics of fun: girls, partying, 
cars — the whole shebang. It’s unabashed pop from a band that knows 
full well it’s “not what it used to be,” but has decided it doesn’t care. 

With bland vocals and liberal use of drums, jaunty lead single “(If 
You’re Wondering if I Want You to) I Want You to” tells a story we’ve 
already heard: Summer hookup culminates with Cuomo telling us to 
make a move ’cause he ain’t got all night. What’s the hurry, you ask? 
He answers that question, too: He “Can’t Stop Partying” because “The 
Girl Got Hot,” and he’s going to “Let it All Hang out.” Notice a pat-
tern?

“Can’t Stop Partying” ventures the furthest from Weezer’s dork-rock 
origins. It’s heavily electronic and synth-driven, with a Timbaland-
esque beat just one step away from the land of Akon autotune. If any-
one still doubts that Weezer circa ’94 is dead, the line “Okay bitches” 
and an appearance by Lil’ Wayne can confirm. But against all our 
better judgment, the Wayne track ends up the album’s catchiest — a 
refreshingly materialistic look at the new, radder Weezer.

“Let it All Hang Out” may have an overused innuendo of a name, 
but it is still one of the better cuts here, with beat-up drums and 
screeching riffs that build to a chorus of actual voice inflections and 
pitch changes. But then there’s “The Girl Got Hot,” playing on heavy, 
repetitive bass and another inane story about generic romance. This 
time, a boy falls in love with someone he knew from the past because 
she — well, it’s pretty self-explanatory.

move, keeping the Giants in NorCal.
But that was in the ’90s, back 

when people had jobs and happi-
ness wasn’t such a rare commodity. 
Unfortunately for Seattle, the issue 
with the Sonics played out a little bit 
differently. 

As alarming as Seattle’s sleazeball 
owner was, I was just as shocked 
at how many fans had taken for 
granted the fact that the Sonics 
would be in Seattle forever, not both-
ering to come to games or express 
their dissatisfaction with the front 
office. Once they realized the Sonics 
might actually leave, they grouped 
together and rallied to keep the team 
in Seattle — a gesture that was ulti-
mately too little too late. 

So yeah, the documentary proved 
to be a real downer on several levels. 
I learned that professional sports is 
an industry based on money, with 
little regard for loyalty. And I found 
out that owners can get away with 
lying to an entire city without paying 
the consequences — as long as they 
have an extra-friendly relationship 
with the commissioner. 

More importantly, I learned we 
should cherish the teams we do have 
while we still have them. 

No, UCSD doesn’t have a foot-
ball team, and probably never will. 
And yes, we currently compete in 
Division-II while most schools our 
size are in Division-I. But we still 
have teams that we can provide us 
with exciting memories. We just 
have to go to their games and stop 
complaining about what we don’t 
have, because you never know when 
you might become victim of a scan-
dal as treacherous as “Sonicsgate.”

goal isn’t enough. We need to realize 
that when the [opposing] team is 
already on its heels, that is the time 
to attack.” 

The Toros evened the contest to 
1-1 in the 71st minute after a hand 
ball outside the Tritons’ defensive 
zone set up a game-tying free kick. 

The two teams continued to bat-
tle with no scoring until the match 
moved into overtime. 

In overtime, Cal State Dominguez 
Hills found the goal once again. 
After a missed free kick in the 98th 
minute,  a lone Toro in a swarm of 
Tritons sent a header past Armstrong 
for the game-winning score.

“We’ve got to win the CCAAs 
next week if we are going to go 
to regionals,” head coach Brian 
McManus said. “We have got to step 
up our game. We are too soft a team 
when meeting challenges and meet-
ing tackles. We’ve talked about it, 
and now the girls have to step up. 
I don’t care if they are freshmen or 
sophomores  — they need to step up 
and be physical.’’

UCSD will kick off the CCAA 
championship at 11 a.m. on Nov. 6 
with a match against No. 3 seed Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. 

Next comes a bout between No. 1 
seed Cal State Los Angeles and No. 4 
seed Chico State. The winners of the 
two matches will then battle for the 
CCAA championship on Nov. 8. 

UCSD and Cal State Dominguez 
Hills have met in the postseason for 
the past two years. 

Dominguez Hills defeated the 
Tritons in the first round of the 2007 
NCAA West Regional a year before 
UCSD clinched the 2008 CCAA 
Championship with a 3-1 win over 
the Toros. 

The Tritons are currently 1-1 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills 

this season, after picking up a 2-1 
win on Oct. 16 and dropping a 2-1 
decision on Nov. 1.

“Dominguez Hills’ strength defi-
nitely lies in their physicality and 
size,” Wethe said. “Our strength 
would be quickness, speed of play 
and creativity. It’s do or die now. It’s 
not a matter of talent, it’s not a mat-
ter of style. It’s just a matter of want-
ing to win, drive and motivation.”

CREW   — Doing its part in the fight 
against breast cancer, the women’s 
crew team hosted its eighth annual 
Row for the Cure on Oct. 25 at Mission 
Bay. Groups from all over San Diego, 
along with the local rowing commu-
nity, contributed to the cause by paying 
an entry fee for the races that raised 
$16,500 for the Susan G. Komen for 
the Cure foundation. 

Although hosted by the women’s 
team, the UCSD men’s crew team also 
participated in Race for the Cure, using 
the exhibition meet to prepare for their 
upcoming season.

“When it comes to Row for the 
Cure, we truly enjoy showing San 
Diego that there is a thriving row-
ing community within the city and 
that across teams we all care about 
social causes,” senior varsity rower Jesi 
Bennett said. “It is a way for us to show 
our support for those who are or have 
been inflicted with breast cancer while 
getting competitive strokes in.”

More than 540 athletes participated 
in Row for the Cure 2009, the largest 
turnout the event’s eight-year history. 

“We had outrigger canoes and a 
dragon boat full of survivors,” head 
coach Pattie Pinkerton said. “It was 
quite inspiring. These women are 

more than survivors; they are thrivers. 
I hope by getting out there, they are 
bringing light to the women who are 
facing this frightening disease.”

As an event hosted by UCSD, the 
Tritons viewed the races — which 
attracted rowers ages 14 to 85 — as an 
important team-building event as well 
as an opportunity improve the rowers’ 
techniques.

“[The Row for the Cure] event 
gives us an opportunity to lock in the 
technical changes we’ve been working 
on while trying out new combina-
tions,” head coach Pattie Pinkerton 
said. “We lost nine seniors last year, so 
this is an opportunity for women to 
step up into leadership roles — in the 
boat and on land.”

Racing against Arizona State 
University and Chapman University, 
the women’s varsity and novice eight 
boats placed third and fourth, at 18:36 
and 19:32, respectively. ASU came in 
first with a time of 18:06, followed by 
Chapman at 18:31.  

“The race itself was a good start-
ing point for our fall racing season,” 
Bennett said. “Since we started train-
ing, much of our practices have been 
focusing on improving technically 
and learning to move efficiently as a 
unit with new team dynamics. Row 
for the Cure enabled us to put our 
newly acquired skills from practices 

to use and get back into the feeling 
of really pushing ourselves physically 
and mentally.”

The men’s team — sporting 
baby- pink shorts and white T-shirts 
throughout the event — took first 
place overall. The Tritons’ collegiate 
eight boat trumped Chapman with a 
time of 15:35. 

The Panthers finished three sec-
onds later in second place, while 
UCSD’s second boat ended with a 
15:44 third-place finish. 

“Although Row for the Cure is 
put on by our women’s team, we love 
helping them out in any way possible 
— and if that means racing each other 
for fun, then we’ll gladly do it,” junior 
rower Justin Gordon said. “Coming 

into this year, we’re expecting great 
things from the team. We’re returning 
more members from our 2009 varsity 
boat than most programs in our divi-
sion, and we have a bunch of recruited 
freshmen who are pushing the varsity 
guys to step up.”

Last year’s men had their most suc-
cessful season in school history when 
they made their first-ever appearance at 
the Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championships last spring. 

The team is looking to improve 
its performance after turning in 
slightly disappointing results from 
the Nov. 1 Newport Autumn Rowing 
Festival. Racing in a field of 30 boats

SOCCER BRACES FOR CONFERENCE PLAYOFFS

By John Beck 
Staff Writer 

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The No. 
18 UCSD women’s soccer team fin-
ished the 2009 regular season with 
back-to-back disappointing losses. 
The Tritons fell 1-0 to California 
Collegiate Athletic Association rival 
Cal State Los Angeles on Oct. 30 
before falling 2-1 in overtime to Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on Nov. 1. 

Including its final losses, UCSD 
concludes the 2009 regular season 
with a 14-5 record (11-5 CCAA). 
Despite the winless weekend, the 
team’s consistent performance 
throughout the season earned 
them the No. 2 seed   in next week’s 
CCAA  Championships, beginning 
Nov. 6 in Turlock, Calif. 

Having already secured a posi-
tion in the upcoming CCAA 
Championships, the Tritons began 
their Oct. 30 match looking to fin-
ish the season on a positive note. 
However, the UCSD offense failed 
to step up, and the Tritons lost to the 
Golden Eagles in a 1-0 thriller. 

The match was tied 0-0 until the 
88th minute. With only two min-
utes   left on the clock, Cal State Los 
Angeles finally broke through the 
UCSD defense to score the game’s 
lone goal. 

The Tritons had their fair share 

of scoring opportunities throughout 
the game, including a 3-1 advantage 
in corner kicks. Both offenses were 
very aggressive: UCSD attempted 
14 shots on goal, while the Golden 
Eagles rebutted with 17 of their 
own. 

UCSD sophomore goalkeeper 
Kristin Armstrong posted a career-
high 10 saves in the game. 

“We played well,” sophomore 
midfielder Anne Wethe said. “There 
is not a whole lot I would change 
about how we played. It happens. 
Sometimes you play better than the 
other team and you don’t win.” 

Looking to bounce back from 
their loss to CSULA, the Tritons 
set their sights on victory two days 
later in a game against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. 

UCSD took an early 1-0 lead 
when — after receiving a cross from 
freshman midfielder Jessica Wi — 
Wethe knocked a header into the 
net. The goal was Wethe’s third of the 
season, and gave Wi her 6th assist on 
the year. The Tritons held their 1-0   
lead up to half time. 

“I think a lot of people found 
a sense of complacency after we 
scored the first goal,” Wethe said. 
“The team needs to be confident in 
our ability to score more goals. One 

UCSD ended its regular season with a pair of losses to 
Cal State LA and Dominguez Hills — both of which 
the Tritons will battle in the CCAA Championships.

When I first stepped foot on UCSD’s campus over three years ago as a freshman, I 
was — like most first-years — pretty 
fucking scared. Traveling 500 miles 
and leaving behind family and friends 
was definitely daunting at first. Up 
there pretty high on the list of con-
cerns, as well, was this pressing ques-
tion: What kind of university doesn’t 
have a football team?

And how was I supposed to sur-
vive here without one?

Within my first month here, I 
emphatically joined the “Bring UCSD 
a Football Team!” Facebook group 
and piped in on every conversation I 
came across between other dismayed 
undergrads, contributing misin-
formed comments about how easy it 
would be to get a team, considering 
the apparently high interest. 

Now, after brushing up on some 
Title IX details and finding out exactly 
what it would take to get a team, 
let’s just say I’m a lot less optimistic. 
No matter how much people want a 
football team, there are just too many 
things working against the perks.

Last month, a new documentary 
showed me how little the passion of 
fans matter to the head honchos of 
the sports industry. It covered the 
brutal side of sports business, the one 
that average fans remain unaware of, 
telling the tale of an amazing city that 
had its historic franchise taken away 
by greed and deceit. 

Fittingly, it has a pretty dramatic 
title: “Sonicsgate.” 

After setting several attendance 
records and making it to the NBA 
finals with Shawn Kemp and Gary 
Payton leading the way, the Sonics’ 
owner sold the team to Starbucks 
chairman Howard Schultz in 2001. 
With seemingly good intentions, 
Schultz oversaw the team during its 
descent to the bottom of the stand-
ings. 

Then, fed up with the Sonics’ poor 
performance and slim profits, Schultz 
sold the squad to a group of investors 
led by Oklahoma City businessman 
Clay Bennett, stating that he was cer-
tain the team would stay in Seattle.

Long story short, e-mails leaked 
out confirming that Bennett bought 
the team in hopes the Sonics would 
move to his hometown, and never 
intended to keep them in Seattle. 
Schultz obviously did not care about 
keeping the franchise in Seattle, con-
tent with sipping on his coffee and 
raking in the Star bucks. With no 
support from elected city and county 
officials, the fans’ chants of “Save Our 
Sonics” were ignored. 

Watching the Sonics franchise get 
systematically destroyed for two hours 
— a feat which actually spanned 
decades of history — I came to a con-
clusion that will break the hearts of 
any sports fan: We don’t have any real 
power over the teams we love, closely 
follow or even live and die by.

OK — that’s not completely true. 
In 1993, a group of investors were 
ready to throw down some money, 
pack up the San Francisco Giants 
and move them out to Tampa Bay. 
The city rallied around the team and 
Major League Baseball blocked the
