Tafoya-Resigns 3rd College Post 
Library: No 
Fees; Just 
Fines'. OK? 
Hop i ng t o c u t 'down on 

paperwork for the l ibrary and the 
cashier's office, t he University 
Libraries have initiated a new 
ystem for charging students for 

overdue books. They will charge 
fees instead of fi nes . 

According to Elizabeth But ler, 
assistant librarian for Publ ic and 
Instructional Services, if a book is 
not returned by the date on the 
overdue notice, a five doll ar 
"nonrefundable billi ng fee" will 
be charged . The new system does 
not apply to reserve materials or 
to books requested by another 
party while lent. 

Butler said that the new system 
IS both more efficient and more 
equi table, because it applies to 
all users of the library. Under the 
old policy only undergraduates 
were charged f<;>r overdue books. 

Preview 

Ed Tafoya has resigned his post as Third College Resident 
Dean, effective Friday. 

The Triton Times learned yesterday that Tafoya, resident dean 
at Third for two years, has accepted admission to a doctoral 
program in religious studies at UC Santa Barbara. 

He could not be reached for comment at press time. 
Third College Dean Raymond Dye said yesterday that he had "heard, 

word" that Tafoya had applied for the UCSB program, but said Tafoya 
had not told him directly. 

Dye said he had several possibilities in mind for Tafoya's 
replacement, but would not reveal names. He said he expected a 
choice would be made by Friday. 

Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs George Murphy, who had not 
been informed of the resignation at press tim.e, said he had talked with 
Tafoya about the religious studies program before he was accepted and 
added that Tafoya had seemed " very excited about it" at the time.

entangled in legal i ntricac ies. 

Keepi ng qu iet is t he more 
difficult part . The part about a 
lawyer is provided th rough Legal 
Serv ices, by Raphae l Levens. 

Not Refe" .. 1 Office 
Levens is the Director of the 

Legal Services at UCSD. He and 

hi staff deal with all types of 
legal problems. 

'We are not a referral office," 
stated Levens, "We can respond 
to every legal problem right 
here," 

Major legal concerns of UCSD 
students involve landlord·tenant 
agreements (or disagreements), 
arrests, residency requirements 
(which, if fu lfi lled, can save an 
out-of-state student money on 
fees). and domestic concerns, 
such as man iage dissolut ions. 

Unfortunately, too fe .... 
students know about this free 
legal aid , Those who do have 
usually learned about it by word 
of mouth . This IS particularly 
unfortunate in the case of arrests . 
When notified of a student's 
arrest, Legal Services can usually 
arrange to have the student 
released within a few hours on his 
" own recognizance", without 
bail. "Own recognizance", (O.R.) 
means the person is probably a 
responsible ci t izen and won't 

leave town on the next precincts in number of Republicans registered. ApprOXimately 38 
Greyhound. percent of all voters at Revell are Republican while the figure' t the 

other precincts are much lower. 
Some cases require the im· 

mediate attention of a lawyer. For 
instance, if a student is being 
sued or is facing eviction from his 
apartment or house, she or he 
should seek counsel as soon as 
possible. This is especially true in 
arrests. 

Increase in De mand 
Last year , 833 students used the 

legal services available to them , 
As this was an increase in student 
demand over the two previous 
years, the legal staff was enlarged 
this year to include three raw 
students from USD and a part 
time secretary as well as Levens. 
Also , Counsel ing and 
Psychological Services have 
joined with Legal Services in 
those areas where legal problems 
overlap personal problems, 

Legal Service has been 
available at UCSD since 1970, 
when Allen Zink wa the director , 
Leven began hiS directorsh)p in 
1973, leaving a five year practice 
with Defenders, Incorporated, in

CIA in Chile: To Prove Socialism's Failure 
By Wesley herest 

Tht:' issue of the Chilean coup has been raised 
once again, both when the New York Times in a 
ser ies of articles revealed deep CIA involvement 
and more locally when the University of California 
was criticized for maintaining its exchange program 

• with the University of Chile . (There will be a protest 
meeting of the University's involvement at 7.30 pm, 
Thursday October 10, at building 20, room 1128). 

This is not so peripheral an issue as It may seem : 
former ambassador to Chiie, Korry, pointed out in 
an interview with William F. Buckley, Jr., that it was 
essential that the "Chilean road to ~ocialism" (i.e ., 
through peaceful elections) not suc;:ceed, for it 
would set an example and a precedent for the 
countries of Western Europe and eventually, he 
believed, even the United States . And, of course, 
the threat to continued U .S. hegemony in the r st 
of latin America was clear Indeed, one of 
President Perez's (of Venezuela) campaign th mes 
was that one should not vote for the left or a coup 
would follow as it did in Chile. Perez won the 
election by a \;Vide margin . 

So it was important to the interests that control 
the foreign policy of this country that the "ex-
periment" in Chile fail. So important it was, in fact, 
that the Chileans apparently could not be relied 
upon to fail by themselves . Secretary of State 
Kissinger, who was then National Security Advisor, 
said to the Forty Committee, " I don't see why we 
need to stand b and watch a country go com-
munist due to th jTresponsibillty of its own 
people ."- New York Tim 5, Sept . 11 , 1974 (The 
Forty Committee is a committee of five people set 
up by PreS ident Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs to 
overs e the CIA . It is c haired by the National 
Security Advisor (Klss lJlger) . Thus the execu t ive 
branch of the governm ent knew of and authoriz d 
all of the CIA actiVities In Chile.) 

A eries of arti cles by S ymour Hersh In the New 
York Times has revealed that the CIA was given 
eight to eleven million dollars to "destabilize" the 
democratically elected gov rnmen' of Salvador 
Allende. (Due to the black market for dollars, this 
money cou ld have bought $40 - $50 m illion worth 
of destabi li zation "equipment.") CIA Instlgat d 
"strikes" (a more appropriate term would be 
lockout, si nce It was mainly uusinessmen who were 
striking) whi ch creat d much turmoil and unrest. 

President Ford has sought to lustify CIA in-
tervention IJl Chile as an effort to keep alive 
" opposit ion newspapers, electroni c media and to 
preserve opposition political parties ." ThiS is 
surprising, to say the least, since under Allende 
there was no government censorsh ip and the main 
n wspaper EI M erCUriO (which was owned by a vice 
president of Pepsi-Cola living in Connecticut) was 
extremely right w ing. In spite of th ree years under 
Allende, EI M ercurio is alive and well and roow a 
semi-<>ffic ial spokespaper for th e lunta. However EI 
Mercurio is now also v irtually the only surviving 
newspaper. 

Since the coup, Chile has had a government that 
the U .S. government has openly announced is more 
to it s liking. Yet the government has instituted 
public burning of books, posters, and newspapers . 
All murals and wall -paintings have been 
obliterated, there has been stri ct censorship of the 
media, including the harassment of foreign 
correspondents and the expulsion of the outspoken 
Swedish ambassador ; and finally, all opposition 

forms of the media have been shut down and in 
many cases bombed . Further, no news having 
"po l itical content" is allowed to be published . 

In contrast, the May - June, 1974 issue of 
Problems of Communism (a United States In-
formation Agency publication - the USIA is one of 
several fronts for the CIA) writes, "A positive 
evaluation of the Allende years would ... likewise 
stress the conti nued existence of freedom of ex-
pression for all points of view in Chile right up to 
the coup." 

Re~1 Purpose in Chilel 

What then was the real purpose and nature of the 
involvement of the CIA in Chile? Let us consider the 
following example of CIA "interference :" the 
truckers' "strike." 

Problems of Communism stat s that this much 
heralded truckers' strike resulted " in an estimated 
loss of 5150 - 200 million in production (for Chile) ." 
Furthermore, the magarine states, " Agriculture was 
particularly hard hit because the strike took place 
in the midst of the planting season ; indeed there is 
no doubt that part, though not all, of the 25 percent 
drop in the 1973 harvest was the consequence of 
the strike." The New York Tim s of Sept. 20 reported 
that th truck-<>wners' strike was " heavily sub-
sidized" by the CIA. Furthermore, direct subsidies 
were provided by the CIA " for a st rike of middle-
class shopkeepers and a taxi-strike, among others, 
that disrupted the capital city of Santiago IJl the 
summer of 1973, shortly before Mr. Allend was 
ov rthrown by a military coup." 

However, U .S. pol icy makers did not limit 
themselves to CIA ubterfuge t o destroy the 
Allende governm nl. Op n econom ic warfare wa 
declar d, but sin the U.s pr('ss ( hose to ignore it, 
It remained a de fa cto secret Th e poli cy-makers 
crea t ed ' th Intamou "I nvisible econom ic 
blockade," they denied all credi t to Allende's 
gov rnment, they ailed in Its long t{'rm loans 
made to previous Ch ilean governments as soon a 
Allende was elected; and through the U.s . cor-
porations (e.g ., General Mo tors) the U S foreign 
policy makers d nied all spare parts for machlJlery 
and motor vehicles to Chile . Most of these were 
produced IJl Ameri ca . 

The final blow to destroy the Chilean economy 
was th decision to sell U .S stockpiles of copper, 
and thus artificially d flat the price. Copper ac-
counts for 80% of Chil e's- exports. Since thE: coup 
and the Installation o f an ultra-right, pro US 
government, the price of copper has risen sharply . 
(ThiS ri e, IJlc ld ntally, has b en given by Paci fic 
Telephone as a partial iustificatlon tor ItS recent 
telephone rate price hike.) All the other anti-Chile 
policies have also been reversed since the coup. 

The true ' aims of the U.S. government and its 
agen cy th e CIA should now be clear . It was 
essential to " prove" to the " fr world" that one 
could not peacefully achl v true socialism . Much 
more important, however, was that American 
business interests were threatened . It was clear to 
all th world that if Allende were allowed to suc-
ceed in Chil immensely profitable foreign " in-
vestment" would be ended . lust as the advanced 
W es tern powers had been prevented from stealing 
the wealth of th USSR, Eastern Europe, China, 
North Korea, and finally Cuba, so would Chile 
disappear from the c lutches of the hug cor-
porations .. 

Thus All ende h.ad to be stopped by any m eans 
poSSible .

Snack·Bar Milk Prices 

I was outraged to calcu late the price per gallon of milk that is 
served at the Revelle Snack Bar . When calculated the milk costs 
approximately 54 per gallon . 

I base my figures on these facts : 1) the price of an 8 oz . glass is 25 
cents, 2) the price of one quart on this price is 51, 3) the price of one 
gallon at this rate is 54! 

Do you think there is just cause for this? I feel the students and 
staff m mbers who use this bar for lunch, breakfast and other meal s 
are gettin g gyped . Could you investigate?

The Press Box 
Sports Editor 
kirk Robinson 

If you ever have the desire to b com a great (or 
eve n a good) sportswriter. th ere are a few important 
tasks that you must master. 

Today's lesson involves th art o f ob ervi ng a 
football game from the press box 

rrom the tim e you co nsume your first beer on 
arrival until you are forc d to leave the lock r room 
by th e mell sweat p rmeatmg your tape record r, 
there is a spec ifiC ritual that any grea t sportswriter 
must follow. Call th em th e tTlCks of the trade, if you 
will . 

League scores pop In once in awhi le. 
Now that you have a firm gra.~o of what is 

happening in the athletic world for the day, you can 
settle comfortably into your seat and await the 
opening kickoff. 

Once the game begins you must continue to 
impress the fans with your work . Write down the 
scores of the other games on the "pick sheet" that 
LJ gave you earlier in the week, continually figuring 
out whether or not you can still win . If the green 
monster spews forth another series of scores, get up 
and lud,c ,ously study the information (I f you try to 
get an. update on that important LA-Detroit game, 
you will probably f ind out that Oakland did n't score 
In the bottom of the fifth or that Calga ry scored 
another touchdown against Saskatchewan) 

All the time you must continue to impress the 
people obserVing the press box, but don' t forget to 
ke p track of the gam e gOing o n In front of you If 
you fail to keep at least one eye on the game you 
m ight miss the play that will give you your chanc 
to ask the que tlon to the play r of the game
