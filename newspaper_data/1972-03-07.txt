Rick Orom 

.. I would only go into the 
UCSD bookstore once a year -
to rip off a diary ." This is the 
sentiment of a student towards 
the bookstore on Matthews 
campus. But he is not alone in 
hi feeling of discontent with 
bookstore policies and 
practices. A recent bookstore 
Improvement meeting raised 
senou question as to the 
responsiveness of the 
bookstore to student needs . 
This meeting worked to 
consolidate student and facultv 
support to in titute reforms at 
the bookstore. 

Some students have al ready 
been working on the problem. 
Steve Griffin . a UCSD 
undergraduate. was concerned 
about the bookstore and 
became a student member of 
the Bookstore Advisory Group. 
ThiS is "an advisory committee 
In the development of 
recommendation for 
op rational improvements and 
long range goal ." according to 
our student dlrectorv But a 
new student member . Steve 
Brault. replaced Griffin 
Brault sa id that Griffin had 
tried to work With the group bu t 
had met stiff oPPosllion ThiS 
caused Griffll1 to "10 e hiS 
eff ctJvenes .. 111 the group. 
" Basic Effort _. , Don't 

Exist" 
Griffin did not relent in hi s 

efforts to improve the 
bookstore. though. On March 3. 
the Triton Time printed a 
letter to the editor by Griffin : 
another will fOllOW'. In the 
I tter Griffin raised many 
serious questio n abou't 
management policies at the 
bookstore. He concluded that 
" the basic constructive reform 
e ff o rt s don ' t exis t In 
substantial amounts." 

But support for constructive 
reform efforts is growing. 
Brault b gan investigating the 
bookstore along with Vincent 
Schwent, a graduate student. 
Together the y gathered 
ll1formation on problems and 
po sible olutions. To gel a 
broader base of support they 
invited the dean of tudents, 
the assistant provo t at Muir 
and interested students to a 
meeting last Friday. 

There Schwent, Brault and 
AS President Paul Kaufman 
explained the c urrent 
bookstore si tuation and 
answered questions These are 
some of the facts and ideas 
which they pre ented at the 
meeting. Th y conceded that 
all their figures may not be 
exact. but they are close. 
Either way their sentiment i 
unmistakable 

Schwent's first area of 
concern is With the current 
expansion plans of the 
bookstore. Th bookstore now 
ha 11,000 quare feet of space. 

nder propo ed plans a new 
bUilding of 25,000 square feet 
would be buill soon for $750,000. 
Accordll1g to the Bookstore 
Advisory Group thi expansIOn 
would b necessa r\' to take 
care of U D's' increa d 
needs until at lea t 1980 But 
chwent questions current 

expansIOn plans for a new store 
and why students will have to 
pay for it. 

Expansion Plans Questioned 
According to Schwent. Roy 

H. Pierce. memb r of the 
Bookstore Advi ory Group. 
want a " real good bookstore , 
like Stanford ' ." B.A.G. want 
to build a new one becau e the 

Isual Art Department wants 
to u e the pre ent building. 
Schwent argue that U SO 
may like to have a bigger store 
but it can 't afford a bookstore 

like tanford' . Instead he feels 
that we need a bookstore that 
prOVides adequate ervlces at 
low prices. " We don ' t need a 
store With almost all the 
paperbacks in print a he (Roy 
H. Pierce ) wants: but Instead 
textbooks at reasonable 
prices". Schwent aid He 
contll1ued by pomting out the 
possibility of us ing the 
cafeteria at Third College 
in tead of building a new 
bookstore, if it I ever closed. 
This would result in the saving 
of 90 percent over the 
construction of a new building. 

Steve Brault made an 
important point wh n he spoke 
about the financing of any new 
book tore. The book tore could 
not be built Without tate, 
federal or University money. 
but would have to pay for It elf. 
That means that students 
would in essence end up paying 
for thi new bUlldmg. Thu 
prices could not be lowered and 
might have to be raised even 
higher than they are now. 

Next Brault explamed hi 
OPPOSitIOn to current hmng 
procedures There are now 
about 25 full -time employees at 
thE' stor . Of thiS numb r only 
two ar students. Brault talked 
with the manager of the 
bookstore at San Diego tate 
and found many rea ons why 
more tudents should be hired' 
1) tudents are easier to tram 
than older people , 2) tudents 
need Job badly and thus 
wouldn 't want to 10 e them , 3) 
if tudents worked there the 
book tore 's Image might be 
enhanced , 4) Stud nt can be 
hired for less than full -time 
work more easlly. At an Diego 
State 50 percent of the taff are 

tude n t : the manager 
expre ed di belief that our 
tore could even make any 

profit without having more 

But our tore IS not lOSing 
mone\' Th exact figures of 
profit each yea r ar hard to 
obtain becau e exce. s mone\ 
could be put back mto the store 
to Increase Il1venton. or 
equipment But the book tore 
manager told the TRITO\ 
TIMES that hi proht was 
about two and one half percent 
of ale last year hwent 
questIOn d the vahdltv of thiS 
figure and wand red whether 
the bookstore 'hould be 
allowed to make any profit 

Another questIOn ral~ed was 
the need for th present 
number of employees. Between 
1965-1966 there v.ere on Iv about 
three employees in th~ store 
Since then the tud nt 
populatIOn ha ' only Increased 
about four lime whereas th 
taff ha mcreased about eigbt 

time , 
Kaufman qu tlOned the 

current cl cllon of goods at 
the bookstore h felt that part 
of the cause of high prJce~ wa . 
Improp r :electlOn technique. 
He urged that thl' tore ~tock

Brault then uggested a 
dra tiC mea ur If the 
book tore did not re pond to 
their reform effort . He 
poll1ted out the feasabillty of 
creating a tudent-run, co-op

Emergency Legislation 
Governor Ronald Reagan announced toda\' he WIll ask the 

legIslature to pa s emergency legl latlOn. which would revIse 
the state's nell' a!(e of majortty law to conform WIth the 1971 
Welfare Reform Act 

The welfare reform law speCIfIed that 18· through 20'year old 
students In the AFDC program making satlsfactorv progress In 
school could conttnue to receIve the assIstance 

However the age of majonty law, whIch goes tnto effect 
March 4 denies AFDe assIstance to these student II the I' are 
18 or over . 

The legl latlon the governor seeks would defer the operatIve 
effect of the age of majonty law as It affects certam state 
education and health programs deSIgned to assIst person 18 
through 20 years of age 

He saId he has dlrectl'd Stale SocIal Welfare DIrector Robert 
B Carleson to mform countIes that the emer~cncy legIslatIon 
IS being requested and to mstruct them to contmue to receIve 
and hold application for AFDC assIstance after March 4 
:'\otlces of dlsconttnuance of aId to tho e persons affected wtll 
be held untIl the latest pOSSIble time and will not r~ sent If the 
remedIal legIslatIon IS passed on an urgency baSIS belore

" illS clear " he saId. "that the age 01 majoTlty law. If not 
amended would abruptly d prtve thousands of famIlies and 
indIVIdual:. of educatIOn and health benefIts they have been 
receIving 

A parallel problem which the governor hope to solve WIth

that he will appeal the decision however, the death penalty 
all the way to the Supreme should have been abolished.

among other things. unusual. 
The only reason it is unusual is 
that it has not been used in the 
last half-decade that the Court 
has been silting on its hands ." 

Bob DeLeonardis, 20 , Revelle 
Sophomore : "The Court has no 
right to overthrow the death 
penalty. because it is judicial 
legislation . Basicallv. the 
death penalty is a good'thing-
a crtminal feels a great sense 
of relief knowing that he can 
never be killed, no maller what 
he does. The argument that YOU 
cannot deter crimes of passion 
is wrong - for example. no one 
ever lost his temper around Joe 
Louis." 

Dave Wallace, 20, Revelle 
Junior: "I'm basically in favor 
of the decision . I think it is 
indicative of the progressive 
nature of the legislation, which 
in turn reflects the progressive 
state of our society." 

Frank Phillips, 19. Muir

consistent with the progressive

major victory for civ il

be of some tnfluence on the

John Maxwell , 20. Revelle 
Junior : ,, [ thtnk the decision 
represents a humanistic trend

Jim Sills, 22. Muir Senior: 
"The decision is indicative of

will the Court give a stay of

thousands of unborn children 
killed in the state every yea r?" 

Mike Sesma, 19, Revelle 
Freshman: " I think the 
decision is good because

Abolish the A.S. 
by John Maxwell 

There is a referendum election in progress which might 
make AS membership voluntary. Is this appropriate? Well let 's 
see what's been happening to your 12 dollars a quarter for this 
year. And, more significantly , let's see what will happen if AS 
membership is made voluntary. 

The AS budget calls for the collection of $140,010 from the 
undergraduate students at UCSD this year.or this. $ 56.004 will 
go directly to financial aids and never be seen by YOUR AS. 
What 's left is $84 ,006 dollars. 

Well , its easy to account for 40 % of this because that's the 
percentage that went to "administrative costs". That means 
that the AS is spending $34,000 of your money on salaries. 
telephones, travel , postage, paper. etc . 

That leaves us with $50 ,006 to go to the real programs of the 
AS. That's 50 out of 140 thousand dollars which will have any 
impact on you, if you are so lucky. 

Not even the AS can screw up 100%, so some of this money is 
spent well . For instance, $12,000 went to programming , $17 ,000 
went to the communications board. and ??????? went to the 
UC lobby in Sacramento. 

The rest goes to various clubs and groups whose funding I am 
not going to give an opinion on but has no real effect on my 
argument. 

My argument is this, the AS is an inefficient and 
uneconomical organ for the distribution of student money and 
the support of 'community services '. 

Even Paul Kaufman can't logically di spute this statement. 
He tried in last Tuesday's TRITON TIMES but failed 
miserably. Read it for yourself , he said nothing 

If the AS is composed of only those who wish to join . the AS 
will be forced to serve those members efficiently. As the AS 
becomes more responsive to its members, it will grow. But it 
will never be allowed to degenerate because its members will 
not join. 

The important programs will remain. We will have a 
newspaper. we will have dances and concerts. we will have 
movies. The movies are self-supporting and the newspaper and 
concerts are funded largely by regular fees , not AS money . The 
only thing that UCSD will be missing is the likes of Paul 
Kaufman abusing the power and money that goes WIth a 
mandatory AS. 

But if you are still not convinced. look at it this way , Can you 
identify twelve dollars worth of services that YOU received 
last quarter? Has the AS provided YOU with anything that you 
could not have provided yourself ? Can Paul Kaufman spend 
your money more wisely than you can?

squander YOUR money on 
salaries ($27.000, and travel 
expenses? This amounts to 
approximately one ·fourth of 
the AS budget. The Magic Bus.

qualities. appears to have to

on this money's magic carpet

worthwhile . Let all of us vote 
for a voluntary A". 

Students Beware! 
The ultraconservative 

Campus Studies Institute has 
recently mailed a glossy "fact 
sheet " which attempts to 
discredit environmentalists , It 
should be noted that the sheet 
employs two rather obvious 
devices, both of which are 
misleading, The first is to 
counter the enthusiastic and 
exaggerated statements of 
laymen (journalists) by the 
more considered opinions of 
scientists - the straw man 
gambit. The second is to 
counter the statements of 

Faulty Flier 
To the author( S) of " Women ' 
The Right to Abortion Is 
Ours": 

I wholeheartedly agree WIth 
the opinion that there is a nght 
to abortion . but your 
inflammatory flier utterly fail s 
to come to grtpS with the 
problem of whose right it is . 
You assume too many thtngs to 
make your plea effective. 
"Tonight two men. neither of 
whom has ever been or ever 
will be pregnant. are going to 
have a ' debate ' about 
abortion ." Do you really mean 
that no one has a right to 
discuss anything unless he or 
she has or probably wtll 
experience it? That would 
mean that we as women are not 
justified in protesting agatnst 
the draft since we will never be 
drafted, and that we cannot 
discuss the merits of more 
readily available vasectomies 
smce our bodies are not 
eqUIpped with vas deferens. 

" Every woman has the right 
to control her own bodv : MEN 
DO NOT. THE C'HURCH 
DOES NOT. THE STATE 
DOES 'OT." While I can agree 
with the stripping of authority 
over abortion from church and 
state. I do not think it is fair to 
probhibit men from haVIng 
some voice. After all , men do 
have a role. however brief. in 
the conception of a child. Even 
WIth the advances in arttftcial 
inseminatton. the sperm that 
fertilizes the egg comes from 
some man somewhere We as 
women have fought to be 
recognized as equals despite 
the fact that it is our bodies 
which carry and bear children. 
Now you' are demandmg a 
pecial privilege on the basis of 

a fact that we wanted Ignored . 
Are women to become the sole 
declsion·makers for the 
propagation of the human race 
simply because theIr bodi.es are

Use of 
AS Funds 

There ha~ been a lot of 
controversy bl' a few 
indiVIduals 'over ' what the 
Associated Students is and 
does. The "Coalttlon for a 
Voluntary AS" has made some 
very serIOus allegattons in 
which they have purposely 
misinterpreted the facts . 

The Coast Cruiser was one of 
many projects the AS has 
undertaken to provide a service 
to students. We invested a total 
of $2.000 over a pertod of 2 
quarters WIth the hope that not 
only would a campus of parkmg 
lots be prevented but that autos 
would not be an essential 
expenditure in order to live off 
campus whIle attending UCSD 
It is a small amount of monel' 
in companson to the number of 
people it has helped and the 
amount allocated on this 
campus to other service whIch 
include $17.000 to the media 
and $10.000 to entertainment. 

Some people (lIke the 
Coalthon I seem to beheve that 
a student should only pay for 
the servIces he uses . on that 
basis. every trip to the health 
center would cost $10, everv 
check chased on campus i5 
cents, every counseltng seSSIOn 
$15 to $30 a half hour not to

The followmg thoughts and

These committments. by

As of October I. 1971. there

because vou didn 't see the need

The AS ha worked to 
improve the quality of student

campus rent scale (never done 
before bl' anvone) and the 
stvles of n;sldence halls : 
worked with off·campus

Water Polo-ers to 
Gather Wednesday 

This Wednesday, March 8 at 4 p.m. there will be a meeting of 
all people interested in spring water polo. This is a very 
important meeting and if you have any aquatic interests at all , 
you should attend it. This meeting will be to gauge the interest 
of the students and to determine the details of the program. 

Spring water polo is basically going to be a " fun " program. 
There will be no direct pressure of the strain of a regular 

. intercollegiate sport, since it is not an inter-collegiate sport. 
Rather, the program will serve to acquaint those int.erested 
with the fundamentals of water polo. A lot of time will be spent 
on fundamentals and drills . Also there will be a lot of time 
spent in scrimmaging and simulating game situations. Thus, if 
you are a prolific swimmer and have always wanted to play 
water polo (since they get all the attention) but just don 't know 
the fundamentals of technique, now is your chance. If you have 
any inclination to the game or to swimming. you are 
encouraged to come out. 

Practice will probably be only five hours a week. It is not 
mandatory that any person go to all the practices, since this is 
not a rigidly structured sport activity. 

Probably the most mandatory function of the whole program 
will be the Wednesday meeting - attendance is mandatory. If 
you are unable to attend, please contact Coach Fred Becker 
and let him know somehow. You can leave a message for him 
in the PE Office, or , if you know some water polo player, 
contact him and let him know that you can 't make the meeting. 

A reminder . all people interested in playing intercollegiate 
water polo next year . are Strongly Encouraged to participate 
in the program. If you know Coach Becker, you know just 
exactly what Strongly Encouraged means. 

Nylon Fanatics Meet 
Many people from UCSD 

have recently shown a verve 
for excitment and fun by 
joining the UCSD skydivers. 
These thrillseekers have taken 
the lead in popularizing sport 
parachuting at this campus. To 
date . the organization has 
sponsored the training of 17 
first-jump students. 
' A student's first sport 
parachuting experience begins 
with his ground training. In 
about three hours, he learns the 
proper way to exit from the 
aircraft , emergency 
procedures, and how to land 
He is then ready to jump. The 
fledgling's parachute is opened 
automatically by means of a 
stallc line device. Once out of 
the aircraft and under canopy. 
the first jumper enJoys a 
magical two and a half minute 
TIde to earth under the firm 
group of the Inflated nylon His 

ride ends when he lands and 
executes a well-exercised 
landing fall . Everyone has 
made a fine first jump and 
many ha ve even made their 
second and third. 

UCSD Skydivers was formed 
in late January by two 
enthusiasts, Scot Goodrich and 
Pete Barta . The primary 
functIOn of the club is to offer 
training and experience in the 
skill of sport parachuting, at 
reduced costs. For the 
experienced skydiver , 
discounted jump rates and 
general group togetherness are 
available. 

In the future the UCSD 
Skydivers plan an exhibition 
jump into the campus as well 
as student competition . 
Tonight thete will be a meeting 
for all those interested, 
member or not, in USB 3010 at 
8p.m.

no choice. The personnel office 
had recommended a higher 
wage than is presently paid but 
a special chancellor ' s 
classification was obtained in 
order to have the wage lower 
and more In keeping with the 
present budget The drivers 
make $2.91 per hour. This week ptoved once again that Pat 's profound playoff 

predictions are peerless. My power of prognostication was 
shown by picking .either of the coed basketball finalists and 
having my choice for the Pee Wee crown bomb out in the first 
round. Nonetheless, I redeemed myself by cleverly naming the 
coed soccer finalists as the unbeaten winners of their 
respective leagues. 

The playorrs contained a lot of fine talent, some 
lackadaisical play, and a couple of out-and-out chokes. Perhaps 
the most exciting game was the coed soccer finale taken by the 
hard-fighting ZOO 2-1 on a goal by Captain Randy Twombly 
with 10 seconds remaining. The DEVILS had just managed to 
tie tbe source a few minutes earlier on an excellent high, 
arching corner·kick by Pony that found tall teammate Paul 
Kohne in perfect position to head it in. The ZOO led throughout 
the majority of the game thanks to an unstoppable score by 
Patrick Hartnett that found the upper corner of the goal. This 
championship game, extremely well-played by both squads, 
was number two in two years for the ZOO, a credit to 
" Serious" Randy and his kickers . 

The VEE 8's clobbered a decimated PSYCHOLOGY group, 
69-30, to cop the coed basketball championship. The chaps were 
led by three starters on the women's intercollegiate team -
Judy Lower with 28, Alena Saimon, 27 , and Cindy " Hands" 
Tashima, 13 - while PSYCH could only counter with Linda 's 
24. The runners-up were obviously missing Kris Hooper , out 
because of doctor's orders, and Nancy Baker , suffering trom 
an unfortunate injury in the semifinals. The victors developed 
championship potential seemingly overnight in the recruiting 
of Judy, who scored 47 points in the semis versus CARNAL 
IGNORANCE, while "holding" Elaine to 39. 

Willie Ewing's LESSER OMENTUM had the situation well 
in hand as they beat OFF 43-35 to reach the Pee Wee finals . 
Tom Wright explained their OFF-a I performance as an OFF 
night coupled with the absence of two starters. Nonetheless, 
it 's Willie and OMENTUM challenging Turkey and his ARGO V 
for the Pee Wee leadership. 

The STREET GANG proved that CAROL DODA 's GOLDEN 
GATE GREATS were just a bunch of boobs as they knockered 
them out of the playoffs, 77-64. It 's the GANG against either

The sport next quarter that is certain to be given the most 

exposure, pictorially, verbally and otherwise, will be coed 
inner-tube water pol<r-a game for water nymphs and other 
maniacs. The 1. M. Department will probably offer some award 
for the skimpiest (or flimsiest) suits. 

The game itself has two basic rules : you sit in an inner tube 
and you move by thrashing your hands and feet. What you try 
to do is put the ball into the goal- two points if a girl does it. 
one point for a guy".and five points if anybody dunks the ref. 
We 're sending a water polo team to the AII-Cal Tourney at 
Santa Barbara ; this may be your chance to go. For more about

The Triton tennis team 
ventured north last Friday to 
challenge Southern California 
Colleges in what began 
'mder inn 0 c en ten 0 ugh

however , was an odyssey of

searches set against the

Upon arriving for the 2:30 
duel, the La Jollans learned 
that a match was already in 
progress between sec and 
Victor Valley Junior College. 
The Tritons made an attempt 
to salvage the trip by searching 
for an available team in the 
area . 

As this plan fell through, and 
the original match wore on, the 
affable coaches of tl:e three 
teams came to an agreement 
which would send two UCSD 
singles players and one doubles 
team against sec, and two 
UCSD singles players against 
VVJC·. This abbreviated 
matching worked well as most 
of the duels, notably Bruce 
Baxley's Singles cliffhanger 
and the Wakefield-Burnett 
doubles marathon, had the fans 
agog even as the last Ilicker of 
sunlight departed.

It IS irritating to hear the 
same rhetOriC year after vear 
from the perpetual student. 
Jim Sills and hi s variet\' of 
orgamzations ranging irom 
DIMENSION and the Leaflet 
coalition to the Coa lition for 
Voluntary AS fees . He shouts 
that saianes are too high 
(Commissioner receive 5 per 
week tor more than 20 hours of 
work/week I and that the AS IS 
to burea ucratlc lzed and 
inefficient :'>Iobod\' has vet 
pointed out the aMuonal book -
keeping costs of a voluna try AS 
where membership records 
must be kept and a ca rd issuPd 
Other campuses have found the 
costs to be between $6.000 and 
$20,000 - ist't that bureau-
cratic ineffiCiency and a waste 
of mone)" 

It also should be pointed out 
that the so-called Coahtion . 
whose members are so deeply 
commllted to eradicating 
bureau(' ratic waste, paid $54 In 
salaries to people collecting 
signa lures on the petitions for 
the referendum Are these 
alanes. or simply "necessary 

bureaucratic expenditures"? 
Students better start asking 
where the Coalition gets the 
funds to po ter the campus the 
way it has and what are the 
real motives of the 
contributors' 

Consider the I ues of the 
referendum carefulI', and 
Investigate for your elf the 
allegations made by others and 
myself. Do not be bullshitted by 
a group those operatIOn IS 
nothing less that the "political 
mach ine" they deride. I hope 
you Will conSider the issues
