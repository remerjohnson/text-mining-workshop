UCDC, a popular program that sends 
UC students to intern in Washington D.C. 
while earning academic credit, is facing 
budget cuts that could dramatically reduce 
the program’s size and scope.

The UCDC Academic Advising 
Committee met Sept. 23 to discuss the a 
reduced budget proposal. The committe will 
meet again next month to continue discus-
sions.

“We’re looking at ways to streamline the 
administrative structure and to take advan-
tage of curricular overlap among campuses,” 
Associate Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate 
Education Barbara Sawrey said.

The program allows juniors and seniors 
from the nine undergraduate UC cam-
puses, the University of Pennsylvania and 
the University of Michigan to study in 
Washington D.C. for a quarter while work-
ing 32 hours a week at an internship and 
taking upper-division classes.

Currently, each campus has its own 
branch for recruiting students and professors 
to participate in the UCDC program. The 
proposal under consideration by the commit-
tee would consolidate the branches into one 
larger entity in order to cut operating costs.

“The UC Washington Center is a place 
where all the campuses come with their 
students, and that’s why each campus has it’s 
own director,” UCSD Washington Program 
Director Samuel Kernell Kernell said. “The 
new plan calls for a much bigger main cen-
ter, as it takes over things that are presently 
covered by the campuses.”

The plan would also make cuts to cur-
riculum and residential programs. Kernell 
said that if all the branches are consolidated, 

fewer total courses would 
be offered. The reduction 
would especially limit the 
number of courses spe-
cifically geared toward 
UCSD students.

Though budget constraints led university offi-
cials to slash all funding for the senior-seminar 
program earlier this year, four faculty members have 
continued to offer seminars this quarter — on their 
own time, and without compensation.

Participation in the program has fallen dramati-
cally since Spring Quarter, when 27 faculty members 
offered senior seminars with the promise of a $1,500 

stipend.
Sociology professor Mary Blair-

Loy, mechanical and aerospace 
engineering professor Carl Gibson, 
chemistry professor Judy Kim and 
bioengineering professor Robert 
Sah are the only remaining instruc-
tors who chose to lead a seminar 
this quarter. 

A letter sent by Associate Vice Chancellor for 
Undergraduate Education Barbara Sawrey to the 
Academic Senate faculty members in March 2009 stated 
that stipends would not be provided for professors who 
offered the seminars, though they were encouraged to 
participate on a voluntary basis.

First introduced Fall Quarter 2006, the senior-
seminar program was created to facilitate closer 
interaction between faculty and students through 
smaller, less demanding courses. 

“I definitely feel like I’m missing out by not talking 
to the professors, because the job of the TAs is to kind 

Professors no longer receive
stipends for teaching senior 
seminars. Freshman equivalent 
could see similar cuts next year.

4 ive performances from the Game, Holy Fuck and Anberlin drew over 6,300 attendees to Warren Field last Friday, making FallFest 2009 the largest in the 
event’s history.

Holy Fuck kicked off the festival at 8 
p.m., meandering through a set of electron-
ic jams that failed to draw much response 
from the early crowd. They were followed 
by power-poppers Anberlin, who roused 
the indifferent student body by dropping 

shout-outs to San Diego and covering ’80s favorites such as 
New Order — earning them scattered mosh pits and head-

of reiterate what the professor’s saying 
— kind of clear things up,” Thurgood 
Marshall College senior Tamer Abu-
Dayyeh said. “The benefit is to talk 
straight to the professors, because he 
or she has the best interpretation of 
what they’re trying to say.” 

Abu-Dayyeh said that allowing for 
more intimate interaction between 
student and faculty allows professors 
to write more informed letters of rec-
ommendation.

“You’ve definitely got to get closer 
to your professors — talk to them, 
become buddies with them — so that 
it’s not weird when you’re asking for 
a letter of recommendation or a refer-
ence from them,” Abu-Dayyeh said. 
“Lots of times, professors just have 
a generic letter of recommendation 
where they just fill in the blanks with 
your name or your information, but 
the best ones come from the professors 
that actually know you — that have 
worked with you on a deeper level.”

Funding for freshman seminars 
is still available for this current aca-
demic year, but the near future of its 
funding remains uncertain. 

“It’s pretty generous, the profes-
sors who do this,” professor Lisa 
Tauxe, who teaches a freshman semi-
nar, said. “They get a little bit of 
research money … per seminar, if 
they have enough students. So it’s an 
incentive to teach these classes, and 
without it I don’t know how many 
will continue to do it.”

This quarter, 64 freshman semi-
nars are in session.

Looking for a great pharmacy school?

“My concern with the changes 
that are being proposed is that they 
aren’t as attentive to the needs of 
UCSD students who need to come 
here and satisfy upper-division 
requirements to graduate,” Kernell 
said. “If we change the academic 
offerings in the ways that are pro-
posed, it may not be as compatible 
for juniors and seniors who need to 
graduate on time.”

Students participating in the 
program currently pay approxi-
mately the same quarterly fee in 
Washington, D.C. as they would at 
their home campuses. Though the 
student fees cover lodging expenses, 
the UC Office of the President pays 
for the program’s operational costs 
and administrative salaries.

The committee is looking for ways 
to lift these expenses from the uni-
versity—such as rerouting student 
fees or terminating administrative 
positions.

“If they fail to receive student fees, 
the center would shrink in terms 
of its budget dramatically,” Kernell 
said. “It would no longer provide the 
type of services students now enjoy, 
which include outings and speakers. 
We recently set up student counsel-
ing services. For the first six years, 
there was nowhere students could 
turn. Now we have people who stu-
dents can turn to, and students have 
taken advantage of that, and that 
costs money.”

The committee plans to have its 
proposed cutbacks ready for review 
by Winter Quarter 2010.

“Administrative changes would 
happen with the agreement of the 
campus, the senior vice chancellor 
of Academic Affairs and the UC 
Office of the President,” Sawrey said. 
“Curricular changes would need the 
approval of the Academic Senate — 
which means both UC-wide com-

mittees and local 
committees, such 
as the Committee 
on Educational 
Policy.”

Sawrey said 
that the com-
mittee will try 
to maintian the 
program's qualtiy 
despite the inevi-
table cuts.

“UCDC is a 
wonderful pro-
gram and is very 
strong,” Sawrey 
said. “Most stu-
dents find it to 
be a life-chang-
ing experience. I 
visited our stu-
dents last fall and 
found them to be 
a dedicated and 
mature group of 
people who were 
passionate about 
their work.”

Ariane Myers-Turnbull, a recent 
UCSD graduate who participated in 
the program in Spring Quarter 2009, 
said that her experience with UCDC 
helped determine her career path.

“I decided on doing UCDC 
instead of going abroad, and I feel 
like it was the more valuable choice,” 
Myers-Turnbull said. “I found the 
experience valuable for giving me 
work experience and introducing me 
to D.C. political culture.”

Kernell said that although the 
future of the program remains uncer-
tain, big changes are coming.

“I’m concerned the program 
will change in ways making it more 
expensive or less attractive,” Kernell 
said. “I encourage all interested stu-
dents to get involved now.”

former affiliate 50 Cent’s crew with

then earned scattered “boos” when he 
attempted a round of “Fuck Jay-Z!”  

After pulling about 30 female stu-
dents from the crowd to dance on stage 
behind a huge posse of towel-tossing 
homies, the Game lifted two heavy gold 
chains from around his neck and gifted 
them to a girl on his left. 

Near the end of his performance, 
the Game’s deejay started mash-
ing Michael Jackson and Jackson 
5 tracks in tribute to the recently 
deceased pop star. However, the 
Game soon motioned to cut the 
lightweight beats, asserting that he 
“ain’t one of them guys,” and that he 
“likes pussy — a lot of it.”

“I thought it was pretty out there,”  
Sixth College freshman Ryan Brown 
said. “I definitely thought it was rude. 
I didn’t like how he kept putting on 
the Michael Jackson and then stop-
ping it to put on something else.”

Warren freshman William Cho 
agreed that the Game was disrespectful.

“The only [other] bad thing was 
so many people were smoking weed 
and I could hardly breathe,” Cho said.

The A.S. Council moved its annu-
al festival from the usual location at 

RIMAC Arena to Warren Field this 
year. The field’s 10,000-person capac-
ity was large enough to hold all who 
wished to attend — including about 
500 faculty, alumni and nonaffiliates 
who had purchased tickets for $18. 

Last year, FallFest headliner Lupe 
Fiasco attracted approximately 6,500 
attendees. However, 2,000 angry stu-
dents — collectively yelling “Fuck A.S.” 
— were turned away after RIMAC 
Arena reached maximum capacity.

Associate Vice President of 
Programming Alex Bramwell said his 
department spent $135,000 on the con-

cert this year, compared to the $90,000 
spent in 2008.

“It’s more expensive because 
we had to bring the services like 
the dressing rooms for the artists, 
catering, the stage — the backstage 
area had to be built from scratch,” 
Bramwell said. 

According to Bramwell, the fes-
tival’s security staff was increased to 
about 50 this year to confront threats 
posed by the larger, more open venue. 

“The venue is so much larger and 
there’s so many more holes and ways 
to get in,” Bramwell said. “We were a 

little on edge because of the border-
line riots [last year].”

Despite five alcohol-related cita-
tions and one arrest, Bramwell said 
things were running well enough by 
9 p.m. to send home four of the eight 
police officers hired for the night.

“We think everything went really 
smoothly, it’s my definite recommenda-
tion to keep the set up relatively similar 
[next year],” Bramwell said. “The field 
left us for plenty of room to grow.”

In an attempt to enliven my hellish three-hour gap between classes, I’ve taken to visiting 
AOL.com in search of the bizarre 
news that doesn’t quite make it on 
the nightly 6 p.m. broadcast.

One such item I recently found 
takes the cake for most intense fight 
ever between man and machine: 
Evidently, a 40-year-old dude from 
Georgia became so frustrated with 
an airport’s self-serve kiosk that he 
right-hooked its touchscreen until 
— $15,000 worth of damages later 
— he was arrested. 

His reasoning? The defenseless 
little machine was taking too long 
to accept his information.

Real smooth, man. 
It goes without saying that this 

guy needs some psychiatric assis-
tance. But what I can’t figure out is 
why the kiosk, and not some sloth-
ful airport employee? 

Sure, we’ve all experienced melt-
downs prompted by research papers 
and the death of our childhood pet, 
but it’s not every day one’s stress 
is relieved by destroying such an 
expensive inanimate object. (Or, if 
it is, one should at least hold the 
excuse of having consumed a large 
quantity of tequila beforehand).

What places Kiosk Basher in a 
special category is his opponent: 
technology. That’s right, Basher 
is someone we can refer to as a 
neo-felon: an individual who com-
mits a crime against our modern 
techno fetish (don’t Google that). 
He expected the unknowing little 
airport kiosk to make his life easier, 
when it actually made his life hard-
er — which, to man on the go, is 
downright unacceptable. Machines, 
after all, are supposed to be our 
slaves.

I can’t say I’ve never felt Basher’s 
pain. When I swipe my credit card 
at a parking meter only to find it’s 
out of order, I do indeed feel the 
innate urge to kick the bitch where 
it hurts — but then I tell myself that 
a broken toe and a probable fine 
won’t make her spit out a parking 
pass. At which point I grudgingly 
(gasp!) drive to the machine in the 
next lot over.  

If there’s one lesson we can 
learn from others’ humiliation, 
though, it’s that the ominous rain-
bow wheel does not — I repeat, 
does not — give you license to hurl 
your MacBook through a window. 
Suppose there’s a freshman standing 
on the ground floor of Tioga right 
as your iLife comes hurtling out 
of the heavens. Oops! You just got 
sued for giving him a concussion.

Just consider Basher. He’ll 
never have the pleasure of sam-
pling Delta Airlines’ mouth-
watering peanuts, ever again. 

Nevertheless, there are still 
some people who will feel the 
carnal need to destroy. Going back 
to our friend with the temper, let’s 
make something clear: Gentlemen, 
if you’re going to try to prove your 
strength and manliness in public, 
don’t attempt to kick the ass of a 
malfunctioning machine. Believe

HIGHER EDUCATION — Understandably, admission pamphlets 
have long painted their universities to be faultless havens of higher 
learning with impossibly diverse student populations. But a more 
honest day is dawning: Dozens of admissions offices across the 
country are beginning to feature student-written blogs on their Web 
sites which present real, firsthand perspectives on the college expe-
rience. If only for the sake of not wasting the time of new freshmen 
and transfers applying to UCSD, ours would be wise to do the same.

The concept behind the blog is simple: offer prospective 
students a glimpse of the next few years of their life before 
unloading their duffel bags onto those sin-drenched mattresses 
and tearfully hugging mom goodbye. The blog should, ideally, 
transcend cheery admissions-office propaganda to reveal what 
on-campus living is actually like.

ON CAMPUS — The budget crisis 
has claimed plenty of victims at 
UCSD. Now, joining TA salaries 
and an array of German Literature 
courses already in tragic extinc-
tion is the beloved senior-seminar 
program.

Last year, UCSD seniors had the 
chance to take a single-unit, 20-stu-
dent course on a highly specific 
topic of their choice, ranging from 
“Hearing Racialized Gender” to 
“The Hermit: Solitude, Society and 
the Search for Meaning.” 

From its conception in Fall 
Quarter 2006, the senior seminar 
program was designed to provide 
seniors with a uniquely small dis-
cussion setting. After funding was 
eliminated this year, however, the 
popular scheduling-filling program 
shrunk from 28 courses to four.

Under budgetary circumstances, 
the seminars may have seemed an 

unfortunate but necessary sacrifice: 
On the surface, seminar students 
seem to do little more than dip their 
toes into a highly specific area of 
concentration. But the opportunity 
for a close-knit learning environ-
ment is a rare one at a school of 
over 22,000. 

University officials have already 
acknowledged the need to avoid 
individual anonymity by splitting 
students up into six smaller col-
leges. In an academic setting, how-
ever, students risk getting lost in the 
shuffle.

In the past, the professors who 
chose to teach senior seminars have 
gotten $1,500 in research money 
for their efforts. Though four admi-
rable professors chose to run semi-
nars for free this quarter, we can’t 
expect all faculty members facing 
pay cuts, layoffs and furloughs to 
assume the full burden of saving the 
program on their own dime.

Seeing as freshman seminars 
(single-unit courses geared toward 
younger students) have retained full 
funding for this school year, it only 
seems fair that academic affairs 
should spread the love. If stipends 
were reduced across the board, it 
would be possible to offer $1,000 
in research grants — as opposed to 
the previous $1,500 — to profes-
sors that may want to teach senior 
seminars, but cannot spare the time 

and effort without some kind of 
compensation. 

Without a range of senior semi-
nars in different areas of study (last 
year they were offered in 16 differ-
ent departments; this year they’re 
in four), there exist few last-minute 
chances to create the kind of rela-
tionship with a professor that can 
turn out personal enough to land a 
job after graduation. 

Administrators often brag about 
their world-class researchers and 
professors, but if students don’t get 
the chance to get to know those 
trailblazers, they’re missing out on 
a large part of what makes our 
school so outstanding. Seminars 
create an opportunity worth far 
more than the small amount of 
funding they once received, and 
somewhat reducing that amount 
would be preferable to com-
pletely denying seniors some 
much-needed face time with 
instructors. 

Even if a little fund-sharing 
is impossible, that doesn’t mean 
we should keep seniors 30 rows 
back. Perhaps professors from a 
variety of departments could offer 
an open forum discussion each 
month — if necessary, requiring 
online event registration beforehand 
to limit capacity. Though a one-night 
presentation wouldn’t substitute the 
senior-seminar experience, students 

could still learn about a subject near 
and dear to a variety of professors’ 
hearts and chat over snacks after-
ward. The university’s top academic 
priority should be providing stu-
dents with the kind of connections 
that lead to professional opportuni-
ties down the line.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2009� OPINION

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

On the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology’s Web site, student blog-
ger and MIT senior Cristen Chinea 
does just that: 

“There’ve been several times 
when I felt like I didn’t really fit in at 
MIT,” she wrote. “I nearly fell asleep 
during a ‘Star Wars’ marathon. It 
wasn’t a result of sleep deprivation. I 
was bored out of my mind.”

Chinea’s confession might not be 
the most encouraging information a 
starry-eyed MIT hopeful could stum-
ble upon, but it serves a much higher 
purpose than university propaganda.

Such candor is absent on UCSD’s 
admissions Web site. Here, prospec-
tive Tritons may find only a single 
student-drafted (though far from 
uncensored) summary of each col-
lege. 

Under ucsd.edu’s “Student Voices” 
tab, Hochung from Revelle College 
(who appears to be surname-less for 
personability’s sake ), for instance, 
writes that “the resident advisors at 
Revelle are our first and last stop for 
everything,” and that he “[studies] 
hard during the week [with] no time 
for slacking off.”

The most humanizing part of 
Hochung’s post comes in the revela-
tion that he has a boogie board, and 
that he is definitely trying to use it 
more often.

While the obvious effort here 
is to depict UCSD as a prestigious 
place of learning (hey, must be true 
if Hochung says so) that one would 
be honored to call home, that clearly 
isn’t everyone’s story. 

Besides, at selective schools like 
MIT or UCSD, posting the truth 
might save universities a whole lot of 
time sorting applications.   

 Reluctant admissions offices 
may be concerned that such honesty 
will scare applicants away — but 

with over 47,000 applicants last year 
(more than any other UC campus), 
the UCSD Office of Admissions 
need not worry that the pool of 
eager freshmen is going to dry up 
just because of a few students’ rants. 
If anything, being more forthright 
would attract those students who 
will fit in well here and eliminate 
the costs of an unnecessarily inflated 
applicant pool.

Unless you’re one of the fortu-
nate few who have an older friend 
at UCSD to steer you away from 
Plaza Cafe’s soggy pasta and Eleanor 
Roosevelt College’s deathly Making 
of the Modern World GE, UCSD — 
and each of its colleges — remains 
no more than an enigma before those 
first eye-opening weeks. 

An admissions blog in which 
students could describe their lives at 
UCSD candidly would publicize a 
wealth of crucial knowledge to those 
who need it most, and instill a sense 
of trust in new students that they’re 
not just being fed a load of propa-
ganda. 

A better-informed applicant pool 
would, if anything, give way to a 
more motivated, in-the-loop student 
body — one that actually wants to be 
here, since they’ll have learned some 
of our strengths and flaws well before 
move-in day.

Student blogs may not seem ideal 
as press releases to the suits more 
accustomed to giving speeches on 
Sixth College’s “effective global citi-
zens” to wide-eyed high schoolers. 
But publicizing both the positives 
and negatives of a UCSD educa-
tion would not only make us more 
compelling; it might even save the 
university some precious time and 
resources.

it or not, the bugger won’t work any 
more efficiently once you’ve smashed 
its screen in.

That’s right: 
Punching your laptop 
after “Force Quit” 
freezes your system, 
though momentarily 
satisfying, will only 
result in greater catas-
trophe. Not only have 
you probably punched 
away over a grand in 
damage, you’ve shat-
tered the small pinch 
of pride man still holds 
over machine in the modern age. 

We must remember that techno-
dependency is a generally new 
phenomenon. Our parents grew up 

pretty simply, but after 
a few short decades, 
vinyl is stored on 
something that’s the 
size of a cracker and 
cars look like space-
ships.

Amazing, isn’t 
it? In fact, our hoe-
wielding ancestors 
would probably spit 
on us in shame if they 
could see how lazy and 
tantrum-prone our 

own glorious digital world is making 

us. Technology has become so much 
like one of our own appendages 
that going a couple hours without it 
makes us feel incomplete — yet liv-
ing with it begins to feel like punish-
ment. 

So what if machines break once 
in awhile? Seize that opportunity to 
re-establish the free-as-dirt sense of 
self-reliance you left behind at the 
Apple Store. 

The next time, say, your GPS fails 
you, and you wind up lost in Camp 
Pendleton, save yourself the trouble 
of cussing the system. If you can find 
that on-ramp without it, you’ll be sat-
isfied to know your own wits saved 
your ass — no batteries required.

T his summer, Albert Yu-Min Lin — a former Ph.D. student at UCSD and current researcher for the Center for Interdisciplinary Science in Art, Architecture and Archaeology — trav-
eled to Mongolia in search of Genghis Khan’s 
undiscovered tomb. And he wasn’t alone: 
Following Lin were six large vehicles stuffed 
with thousands of dollars in Geographic 
Information Systems technology, three goats, 
two yurts, a small cadre of horses, a Global 
Positiong System-guided aircraft (for aerial 
photography) and a 19-member team of engi-
neers, scientists, Mongolian interpreters and 
service workers.

 But not a single shovel.

Lin proposed a noninvasive approach to 
locating the infamous Mongolian emperor’s 
grave, and his vision was soon sponsored by the 
National Geographic Society. During the month 
of July, he and his team collected hundreds of 
kilometers worth of satellite images, using a 
remote-controlled aircraft for later analysis using 
Calit2’s high-tech visualization tools — all in 
hopes of locating the Valley of the Khans. 

Considering Khan’s expansive 13th-century 
legacy across Eurasia, locating the tomb would 
be difficult even if shovels were allowed. All Lin 
had for reference was an ancient legend saying 
that after his death in the summer of 1227 A.D., 

Khan was buried somewhere in the Liupan 
mountains of northern China at Burkhan 

Kaldun — the holy mountain at whose 
base Khan prayed before going to war.

According to said lore, after Khan’s 
death, his men corralled over 40 
horses to trample over any trace of 
his burial — but not before divert-
ing a nearby river to flood out 
every last speck of evidence. 

Lin conceived the project 
in Spring Quarter 2008, after 
earning his Ph.D. and finding a 
supportive colleague in professor 

Maurizio Seracini, director of CISA3 (the uni-
versity’s center for reconstructing and analyzing 
the history of archaeological sites and artifacts) 
and principal investigator behind the search 
for Leonardo da Vinci’s lost painting Battle of 
Anghiari. Seracini brought Lin on board after 
learning of the researcher’s interest in restoring 
the good name of Khan, an oft-misrepresented 
historical figure.

“There’s a whole history here about a merce-
nary that’s affected everything we know today,” 
Lin said. “He created the trade routes we know 
today: He created the communication link 
between the East and the West. He was very, 
very forward-thinking and I think that’s what 
should be told.” 

The Valley of the Khans project will run 
until 2011, when the team plans on digging 
deeper into the satellite imagery they collected 
this summer by exploring identified abnormali-
ties with ground-penetrating radar. Until then, 
however, they’ve been surveying the mountain 
range by foot while taking photos by air.

Lin stressed his concern over the recent rise 
in rogue mining and illegal looting in the area 
Khan could be buried in. He hopes to encourage 
international organizations such as UNESCO 
to protect the historically rich region. By creat-
ing a sanctuary, Lin said we can preserve the 
cultural heritage of a man who conquered more 
in one lifetime than the Roman Empire did in 
14 centuries. 

Soon after Lin decided to embark on the 
mission to Mongolia, Nate Ricklin — a graduate 
student who first knew Lin through their shared 
interest in mountain climbing — joined the 
team as an operational engineer. 

He quickly created a Web site for the project, 
helping to draw some public interest. 

From there, the expedition snowballed. 
Companies like GeoEye (which manufactures 
satellite imagery products), RP Flight Systems 
(which specializes in aerial data-collection sys-
tems) and the North Face (which sells outdoor 
gear and clothing) lined up to sponsor Lin’s 
vision.

Searching among mountain ranges that were 
blockaded for over 800 years by Khan’s men 
and occupied by the Russians throughout the 
20th century, the team worked with a large 
gamut of gear and technological equipment 
to survey the region.

Lin said that when he arrived in 
Ulaanbaatarr — Mongolia’s sprawling capital — 
he realized just how ubiquitous Khan was to the 
people of Mongolia and their culture. 

“There’s Genghis Khan airport, there’s

Genghis Khan vodka, there’s Genghis 
Khan cigarettes, there’s Genghis Khan 
everything,” Lin said. 

The team met with the Mongolian 
Academy of Sciences to discuss their 
route through the Liupan mountains. 
Lin’s team wasn’t the first to seek out 
the clandestine crypt. A Japanese 
team tried with no luck in 1990, and 
Chicago millionaire Maury Kravitz 
was just as unsuccessful in an amateur 
attempt at the turn of the millennium. 

“Our goal was to focus on the fact 
that we were scientific and academic,” 
Ricklin said. “You know, that’s what we 
could offer.” 

Without laying a finger on the 
land, the team surveyed the vast 
plains and used a remote-controlled 
aircraft to locate any oddities visible 
above ground that could have been 
Khan’s tomb. Now that they’re back 
at UCSD, they hope to use the visu-
alization tools at Calit2 to convert 
high-resolution satellite imagery into 
virtual reality.

 Lin’s noninvasive approach aimed 
to avoid damage caused by excavation. 

“I think as the world becomes 
more global, it’s important for people 
to respect traditions of individual 
countries and individual civilizations,” 
Lin said.

According to Lin, many people 
in Mongolia believe that disturbing a 
tomb not only unsettles its occupant’s 
rest, but also prevents the spirits from 
entering heaven. During Khan’s time, 
warlords would desolate enemy tombs 
as the first step to overtaking an adver-
sary’s land. 

Lin’s team departed Ulaanbaatarr 
on horseback, riding more than 20 
kilometers into the regions of the 
North where visitors were previously 
forbidden.

Surveying the corrugated valleys 
snaking through the mountainous ter-
rain, Lin and his team spent each day 

trekking over what they could only 
speculate was the mountain range that 
Burkhan Kaldun sat among. 

Kostas Stamatiou, a UCSD gradu-
ate student who recently earned his 
doctorate in electrical engineering, 
served as the team’s historian. 

“What we know from the sources 
is Genghis worshipped the mountain,” 
Stamatiou said. “So there’s speculation 
that he might be buried there, but the 
problem is that nobody really knows 
which mountain Burkhan Kaldun is 
today.”

Working with unmanned aerial 
vehicle (UAV) specialist Michael 
Hennig, the team launched a remote-
controlled aircraft to capture more 
images of potential burial sites than 
any 19-person team could ever be 
expected to sort through. 

Currently, the visual data is being 
reorganized at Calit2 into material 
to be viewed on StarCAVE — a 3D, 
five-wall virtual-reality room designed 
to make the viewer feel as if he or she 
is flying over the Gobi desert — and 
HIPerWall, the world’s highest-resolu-
tion multi-screen display system.

“Can you imagine trying to look 
through thousands of square kilome-
ters on a little laptop?” Lin said. “It’s 
not going to happen, or on a desktop. 
You’d spend the rest of your life trying 
to get your computer not to crash.”

The project will enter its third 
phase by 2010. Using electromag-
netic induction, magnetometry and 
ground-penetrating radar, Lin hopes 
his satellite imagery — when viewed 
in StarCAVE and on HIPerWall — 
could peer into the ground beneath 
possible sites of Khan’s tomb. 

Until then, Lin and his team plan 
on returning to Mongolia next sum-
mer to wrap up the ground surveys 
they started this past July.

T here comes a time when the late-night trek to one of the two La Jolla Village Square movie the-
aters gets old. Maybe you’ve popped 
too many neck veins attempting to 
maneuver through the Ralphs parking 
lot. Maybe you’re just sick of forking 
over $10 every time you’ve got a crav-
ing to see 50 luscious feet of Megan 
Fox. Or maybe the sweaty 20-minute 
walk from campus is still keeping you 
from reaching second base — no mat-
ter how many painstakingly cheesy 
Julia Roberts movies you pay for.
     When you’ve reached your break-
ing point, Santee Drive-in is waiting.

Sure, Santee’s dinky old road stop of 
an establishment may be a good 30-min-
ute drive from our manicured La Jolla 
paradise, and it’s not exactly the most 
luxurious movie seat this side of the 
Pacific (unless you drive an Escalade). 
But it does operate on one ingenious 
principle: more for less.

At these grungy drive-in digs, an 
$8 double-feature ticket will admit 
you to a concrete playground where 
the struggle for parking is obsolete, 
grubbing and boozing need not be 
conspicuous and your Volkswagen’s 
tinted back windows can finally reach 
their full potential.

Even better: No one will judge you 
for it. Santee’s crowd — though not 
the most elegant bunch — knows how 
to watch a movie. You could even take 
a tip or two from the drive-in regu-
lars: They are pioneers of the open 
truck bed turned couch, collectors of 

lawn chairs, connoisseurs of dinner in 
a bag and authorities on the warm six-
pack (and warm blankets). 

Santee’s only breach of the more-
for-less principle falls under film 
selection. In this case, a cheap ticket 
means you only have two double 
features from which to choose. Until 
Oct. 15, viewers can opt for “Couples 
Retreat” paired with “Love Happens” 
or “The Surrogate” with “The 
Informant.” They’re packaged by 
genre, and won’t be obscure enough 
to score you indie points. But if you 
happen to find yourself overcome by 
boredom, try plan B: Recline your 
seat, take a swig of two-buck Chuck 
and soak in the darkness. I guarantee 
you’ll find some way to pass the time.

set, the Tritons called another timeout. 
UCSD returned with two straight 

points to tie the set 23-23. Two points 
away from a victory, the team came 
through with an ace and a kill to finish 
off the Lumberjacks 25-23. 

Oct. 10’s match pitted UCSD 
against the Sonoma State Seawolves  
— the Triton’s fourth nationally ranked 
opponent of the season. The Seawolves 
provided a serious challenge for UCSD, 
leaping ahead early in the first set. 

Despite rallying back to with-
in one point at 20-19, the Tritons 
couldn’t overcome Sonoma, who held 
on to win 25-21. 

UCSD had not lost a single set in 
either of their previous three games.

In the second set, the Tritons and 
Seawolves played close, but strong hit-
ting gave the Seawolves the second set 
win at 30-28. 

The loss marked the first time the 
Tritons had dropped two sets in a 
match since Sept. 18.

“They were playing really well,” 
Black said. “They are a good team, and 
we were a little uncomfortable.” 

After the break, the Tritons came 
out resilient, taking a 15-3 lead due 
to a spectacular serving streak from 
Schmidt. There was little stopping the 
Tritons’ relentless assault as they hand-
ily defeated the Seawolves 25-7. 

The Seawolves never held a lead 

in the fourth set, but stayed close 
throughout the game.

The Tritons were able to pull 
away late in the set and defeated the 
Seawolves 25-22 to force a decisive 
fifth set. 

“I think from the second half 
of game two, we had control of the 
match,” Black said. “We were play-
ing more like ourselves again and we 
really had our rhythm going into the 
third set.” 

In the fifth set, the Tritons went 
up 4-0 before the Seawolves could get 
on the board. With strong serving, the 
Tritons took a 10-1 lead and cruised 
through the rest of the match, winning 
15-6 to cap an impressive turnaround 
victory. 

The comeback win was sparked 
by UCSD’s offensive attack, which 
included Schmidt’s record perfor-
mance. Her 31 kills were the most 
since former Triton Janet Hughes 
notched the same number in a game 
on Oct. 23, 1987. 

The Tritons return home next 
weekend as they face Cal Poly Pomona 
on Oct. 16 and No. 2 Cal State San 
Bernardino on Oct. 17. 

“I’m looking forward to next week-
end,” Black said. “It’s a high profile game, 
and it’s what college volleyball is about.”

minute and a close shot that hit the 
post with seven seconds left — the 
Tritons managed to hold on for the 
victory. 

Samaniego and junior midfielder 
David Bakal combined for 12 of the 
Tritons’ 18 shots on Friday. Akman 
had four saves.

Samaniego opened up the scoring 
in the 21st minute, driving the ball up 
the left side of the field and booting 
a shot past the East Bay keeper from 
far  upfield. 

The Pioneers fought back to tie 
things up with just 50 seconds left in 
the half. East Bay’s Aric Johnson and 
Ryan Herriage earned assists on the 
goal as sophomore midfielder Manny 
Cardenas drove a shot past Akman. 

The game's first half saw a total of 
21 attempts from both sides. 

Bakal put the Tritons back in the 
lead when he touched in a cross from 
junior midfielder Shane Mitchell, from 
right in front of the net. The goal was 
Bakal’s second of the season. 

In the 83rd minute, a pioneer 
foul earned the Tritons a penalty 
kick. Samaniego took advantage of 
the opportunity and came through 
with a conversion, giving UCSD a 
comfortable 3-1 lead with seven 
minutes left. 

The Pioneers started their comeback 
in the 87th minute, when freshman 
defender Michael Rossi tapped a ball 
past Akman, off a rebound. Hanging by 
their last thread, the Pioneers managed 
three more shots in the game, including 
a heart-stopping kick by freshman 
forward Arnoldo Mendoza — which 
barely missed the net and bounced off  
the post instead.

UCSD now travels to Carson, Calif. 
to take on Cal State Dominguez Hills

is in cross country.”
Riley also stressed the benefit of 

running with teammates.
“We started well as a solid group 

of five guys,” Riley said. “We moved 
up in the pack that way, and it really 
helped us out.”

Cal Poly Pomona had four run-
ners finish in the top 10 for a score 
of 29 points, which won the meet. 

UCSD tallied 88 points to fin-
ish second out of eight competing 
teams.

On the women’s side, one indi-
vidual performance stood out to 
boost the Tritons’ final score: The 
All-American Schofield ran the 
women’s 6K course in a time of 
22:20, finishing fourth overall as 
UCSD’s top finisher. 

Sophomore Elena Inouye was the 
next Triton finisher, clocking a time 
of 22:58 for 13th place. 

Junior Brianna Alban, sopho-
more Aaryn Kobayashi and senior 

Marie Schaper ran together to round 
out the Tritons’ scoring on the day 
— finishing 22nd, 23rd and 24th, 
respectively.

Central Arizona College won the 
meet on the women’s side with a 
score of 59 points. UCSD’s score of 
80 points set them just a sliver away 
from the University of Victoria’s 
total of 78, putting the Tritons in 
fourth place out of the 13 squads 
that participated. 

Garcia emphasized the impor-
tance orunning at home before 
entering the season’s final stages.

“I think any time we can get on 
a familiar course, its good for us,” 
Garcia said. “I think where the big 
advantage came is with the great 
support we had out there. We had a 
lot of student athletes out there and a 
lot of other students, and getting that 
kind of support is really important 
to our team.”

The Tritons’ next race will 
be at the California Collegiate 

Athletic Association Conference 
Championships on Oct. 24. The 
conference finals will be hosted 
by Humboldt State University in 

Arcata, Calif.

Wong, who entered the game 
with just three season goals, com-
pleted her hat trick in the 61st min-
ute with a driving shot from the 
top of the penalty box, off a pass 
from freshman midfielder Gabi 
Hernandez.

Sophomore forward Sarah 
McTigue gave UCSD a 4-0 lead in 
the 64th minute. After receiving 
a ball from Wi, she placed a shot 
inside the far post. 

Freshman midfielder Alexa 
Enlow finished the Triton scoring 
in the 81st minute, heading in a 
corner kick from junior midfielder 
Remy Hitt.

The Tritons kept their offensive 
attack consistent, outshooting the 
Vikings 19-9 as Wong and McTigue 

added 11 shots. 
UCSD’s defense was just as solid 

in the victory. Sophomore goalkeep-
er Kristin Armstrong and freshman 
goalkeeper Kimberly Cushing com-
bined for the shutout — UCSD’s 
sixth of the year. 

Armstrong made three saves in 
75 minutes, and Cushing picked up 
a save in the final 15 minutes of the 
match.

The Tritons have scored a total 
of thirteen goals over their past six 
games. With only seven games left 
in the regular season and playoffs 
looming on the horizon, head coach 
Brian McManus believes UCSD is 
finally performing to the best of its 
ability. 

McManus hopes the team con-
tinues this level of play for the 

remainder of the regular season, 
and throughout the playoffs.

“We’ve been talking about shoot-
ing all year, but tonight we tried 
it,” McManus said. “Tonight we did 
things smart in the box and took our 
chances.”

After winning nine of their 
last ten matches, the Tritons will 
attempt to extend the six-game win-
ning streak when it takes on confer-
ence opponent Cal State Dominguez 
Hills in Carson, Calif. on Oct. 16. 
Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.

The game will be a rematch of 
last season’s CCAA championship 
game, when the Tritons beat the 
Toros 3-1.

The sophomore midfielder scored three goals in UCSD’s 
5-0 win over Western Washington on Oct. 8. Wong’s hat 
trick helped draw out the Tritons’ win streak, which now 
stands at six games.

After winning 15 national
championships from 1991-2001, UCSD 
has not won a single one since. Only once 
during this time period did a UCSD team 
finish as a national runner-up: women’s 
crew, in Spring Quarter 2007.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — 
The No. 3 women’s volleyball 
team completed a two-game 
road trip on Oct. 10, going 
undefeated and watching 
their star player tie an all-time 
school record. 

UCSD defeated Humboldt 
State on Oct. 9 before beating 
No. 17 Sonoma State on Oct. 
10. Senior outside hitter Sylvia 
Schmidt recorded 31 kills to tie 
UCSD’s single-match record. 

Halfway through their con-
ference schedule, the Tritons’ 
record stands at 18-1. They 
sit in second place, one game 
behind CCAA leader Cal State 
San Bernardino.

UCSD started slow in the 

match against Humboldt State, 
unable to pull away from the 
Lumberjacks. However, with 
the score tied at 12-12, UCSD 
had a breakout set, and took a 
19-13 lead. 

Despite the surge, the 
Lumberjacks slowly fought 
their way back into the match, 
pulling within 20-17 — but 
three quick kills by the Tritons 
closed the game at 25-20 and 
sealed the first set. 

At the start of the second 
set, the Tritons fell behind, 
but recovered with a 12-2 run 
that pushed them to a 19-10 
lead. Down eight points, the 
Lumberjacks stormed back 
to come within two points at 

20-18 — forcing UCSD to take 
a timeout. 

“We were playing the 
point,” head coach Tom Black 
said. “We needed to focus. We 
were just thinking about what 
we needed to do next.”

After the break, the Tritons 
regained their composure fin-
ished off a 25-20 victory. 

After nearly upsetting 
UCSD in each of the first two 
sets, the Lumberjacks took a 
commanding third-set lead 
for their biggest threat of the 
match. With Humboldt cling-
ing to a 23-21 advantage and

MEN’S SOCCER — The Tritons came 
out swinging this weekend, both at 
home and on the road, completing 
their first sweep of the season. 

Facing Cal State East Bay, UCSD 
scored a season-high three goals to 
triumph 3-2 on Oct. 9. Two days later, 
a shorthanded UCSD team finished off 
the Pioneers 2-0.

“We were definitely the better team 
in both games,” senior forward Tony 
Choi said. “We had control throughout 
most of both games. Friday we were 
just not completely there,  giving up a 
couple of very weak goals. [Sunday] it 
was a much different story because we 
knew exactly what they were going to 
do, and we were better prepared and 
more mentally focused to get the job 
done.”

UCSD now stands 7-3-4, with 
a California Collegiate Athletic 
Association record of 4-3-3. In its first 
season in the CCAA, Cal State East 
Bay sports a dismal 1-13 overall and a 
0-10 league record. 

The Tritons will face a tougher 
test on the road against Cal State 

Dominguez Hills this weekend. CSDH 
currently sits in second place in the 
CCAA South Division, with a 7-4-1 
record in conference play. 

On Sunday, the Tritons came out 
with a bang by scoring within the 
third minute of the first half. The shot 
came from junior midfielder Aaron 
McDowell — his first goal of the 
season. 

Although UCSD dominated the 
first half of the game and outshot the 
Pioneers 10-3, the game plan shifted 
when junior forward Mikel Samaniego 
was red-carded, leaving the Tritons a 
man short. 

Despite the penalty, the Tritons 
kept up a solid defense, limiting the 
Pioneers to three shots on goal. 

UCSD’s second goal came off junior 
midfielder Shane Micheil’s pass to 
freshman midfielder Kian Malek, who 
shot a low ball past the East Bay keeper 
for a 2-0 Triton lead. The shutout was 
senior keeper Peter Akmans’ sixth of 
the season. 

“We ran into a bit of adversity 
with going down a man, due to a red 
card, for a majority of the game,” Choi 
said. “We've been in a similar situation 
before, though, and we stuck together 
and battled through. Our bench did 
a great job of coming on the field 
to bring some fresh legs and energy, 
because we had to help cover for the 
extra man. Our coach John has always 
stressed that we will beat teams with 
our bench and that we have one of 
the deepest teams. That really showed 
today.”

Samaniego, a Seattle University 
transfer, led the Tritons with two goals 
scored. 

Despite a late comeback from East 
Bay — including a goal in the 88th

CROSS COUNTRY — The Tritons 
took full advantage of their final 
home meet of the regular season, 
turning in strong performances at 
Saturday’s annual Triton Classic. 
Both the men’s and women’s team 
finished in the top four. 

The men placed second overall 
— with five runners placing in the 
top 20 — while junior Bre Schofield 
led the women to a fourth-place 
finish. 

Now that their regular season is 
over, the Tritons will focus on pre-
paring for the conference champion-
ships, set to begin Oct. 24. 

“I was pleased,” head coach Nate 
Garcia said. “On our course, it’s 
important to be patient early on and 
really attack the second half, and 
both of our squads did a very good 
job of that.”

Sophomore Jeremy Riley led the 
men’s team by placing 10th, finish-
ing the 10K course in 33:37. He 
was followed closely by senior Mike 
Wright in 11th place. Sophomores 
John Svet, Alex Corliss and Andre 
LaMothe posted the only other 
Triton scores: 14th, 17th and 20th, 
respectively. 

Many of the UCSD runners ran 
in packs with their teammates, pac-
ing each other and contributing to 
the team’s strong final score.

“We saw some real important 
team grouping,” Garcia said. “Pairs 
of people were running together 
throughout the race, and there’s no 
way to overstate how important that

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The No. 14 
UCSD women’s soccer team scored 

early and often on Oct. 8, defeat-
ing Western Washington University 
5-0  before extending their streak 
on Oct. 11 by beating Cal State East 
Bay 1-0. 

Sophomore midfielder Shelby 
Wong led the Triton offense against 
Western Washington by scoring 
three goals.

“Our team was really pumped 
up for the game,” Wong said. “The 
energy was great out there, and we 

were doing a really good job of talk-
ing to each other.”

With the pair of weekend victo-
ries, UCSD improved to 11-2 for the 
season. The Tritons have won six 
straight matches, outscoring their 
opponents overall 13-1.

Wong wasted little time starting 
her hat trick: She scored her first 
two goals early in the game, just 34 
seconds apart. 

Wong sent a kick into the right 

side of the net from eight yards out 
,with assists from sophomore mid-
fielder Anne Wethe and freshman 
midfielder Jessica Wi. 

On the team’s next possession, 
Wong took a long pass from Wethe, 
beat two defenders at the top of the 
penalty box and blasted a shot into 
the upper right corner for a quick 
2-0 lead. 

A hat trick and two 
shutouts lead women’s 
soccer to a series sweep 
of Western Washington.
