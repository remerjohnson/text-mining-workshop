Progressive student activists 
Stanford to' host conference 

By PETER MESSROBIAN 
News Editor 

Up to 500 people are expected 
to attend a conference of student 
activists that will be held this 
weekend at Stanford University. 

The conference is the second 
annual meeting of the California 
Alliance of Progressive Student 
Activists (CAPSA), which was 
founded by the UC Santa Bar-
bara student government in Feb-
ruary of 1987, according to 
CAPSA planning committee 
member Martha Cody. 

Issue to be discussed include 
electoral politics, building multi-
cultural unity in the student 
movement, the CIA on campus, 
the student government and stu-
dent empowerment. In addition, 
a series of issue caucuses will be 
charged with coming up with 
si1ecific proposals of various 
thing CAPSA should do, and 
the conference will choose a few 
of those to concentrate CAP-
SA's energies on . 

CAPSA is described in a lea-
flet as a "network of students in 
California who consider them-
selves part of a growing move-
ment for progressive social 
change." Cody de cribes the 
organization as "grass-roots ori-
ented "and the only officials are 

the eight members of the plan-
ning commitee, who have one-
year terms. 

After the initial UCSB confer-
ence in February, there was con-
siderable interest in "forming 
something more permanent, [so 
we] agreed to have another con-
ference at Davis in April ," Cody 
said. "[We spent] two days 
hammering out the principles of 
unity, encompassing both polit-
ics and organization." 

Any individual or group who 
supports the purposes, goals , and 
principles of CAPSA may join, 
and ·there are about 30 student 
groups from some 15 campuses 
across California that currently 
belong. 

CAPSA is intended as both a 
"communication and an action-
oriented network,' according to 
their statement of purposes and 
goals. Cody described the organ-
ization's two main powers as the 
ability to call for joint action by 
member groups, and the endor-
sement of particular activities. 

"A lot of people look back on 
SDS from the sixties," Cody 
said . "We're not trying to model 
ourselves on [that group]." I n-
tead, Cody emphasized CA P-

SA's role as attempting to meet 
the "needs of the student move-
ment today." 

While CAPSA may decide at 
the conference to tackle a variety 
of issues over the next year, each 
campus group will likely concen-
trate on just a couple of them, 
according to UCSD Progressive 
Student Association member Joe 
Wainio . "If there are things that 
are going to split [the member-
hip of CAPSA], we won't en-

dorse it .. . . [rather, we'll] con-
centtate on issues we can unify a 
lot of people on ." 

Some of the principles of 
CAPSA adopted at the Davis 
conference include: 
• Supporting elf determination 

for all nations 
• Opposition to U.S. interven-

tion 
• Democracy in chools and the 

right to a free , quality, SOCIally 
responsible and relevant educa-
tion 
• Opposition to militarism 

Schools involved in CAPSA 
include UCSD, UCSB, Stanford , 
UC Berkeley, San Franci co 
State, U CSC, and junior colleges 
like Alan Hancock and Alameda . 

UCSD student are currently 
arranging carpools for the trip to 
Stanford this weekend , where 
the conference will start Satur-
day morning and end Sunday 
afternoon . For more informa-

The inn wins 
Disinformation campaign 
by proponents alleged 

By JAMES GILMORE 
Staff Writer 

Del Mar residents voted Tues-
day to approve developer Jim 
Watkins' proposal to build a 
123-room hotel , 12 time-share 
condominiums and a 4 ,700 
square foot retail shopping cen-
ter on the corner of 15th Street 
and Camino Del Mar. As of 
Wednesday, the offical tally 
howed that 1,392 residents had 

approved Watkins' proposed 
Chateau Del Mar, exceeding op-
ponents by 209 votes. 

The approval settles a com-
munity dispute over the devel-

opment which began nearly one 
year ago . On Sept. 22 residents 
rejected a similar proposal of-
fered by Watkins by a margin of 
15 votes. The plan which won 
approval Tuesday is two hotel 
rooms and 12 condominiums 
mailer than the earlier one and 

calls for a 39 percent reduction in 
retail space. 

One-third of the 5.2-acre site is 
currently zoned for retail and the 
remaining two-third for resi-
dential development. Under the 
approved plan , the zoning wil be 
changed to allow for the devel-
opment of the hotel on the resi-

Blood transfu'sion possibly 
contaminated with AIDS virus

Negligence and carelessness on 
the part of the UCSD Medical 
Center, the UC Regents, and the 
San Diego Blood Bank are 
alleged in a suit filed in Superior 
Court of San Diego County by 
attorney Michael Orfield . The 
suit stems from a sextuple bypass 
performed on the late Bill Poli-
koff at UCSD Medical Center 
on Jan . 13, 1984, during which 
he was given a blood transfusion 
with what may have been blood 
contaminated with the HTLV-
III (A IDS) virus. 

Becau e of taff scheduling 
conflicts at the San Diego V A 
Hospital , where Polikoff was an 
outpatient, he was sent to UCSD 
Medical Center for surgery. He 
was discharged after the appar-
ently successful bypass with his 
physical condition listed as 
"good." However, shortly after 
his discharge, he began uffering 
negative drug reactions and ul-
cerated lesions, and had to be 
rehospitalized . He was also suf-
fering from unusual exhaustion. 
Short walks, according to his 
wife , Dorothy Poli'koff, 63, 
would drain his strength .

UCSD'slEI Teatro Ensemble 
to perform in Spain 

The Hispanic theatre company at 
the University of California, San 
Diego will be the only ensemble group 
invited to perform at the international 
conference on "The Hispanic Cultures 
of America," in Barcelona , Spain , in 

June~ The company, entitled EI Teatro 
Ensemble de UCSD, will also perform 
at univers ities in France and West 
Germany. 

Under the direction of Jorge 
Huerta, associate professor of theatre 
at UCSD, the troupe will perform two 
popular pieces of contemporary Chi-
cano theatre , "Los Vendidos," by Luis 
Valdez and EI Teatro Campesino, and 
"Johnny Tenorio," by Carlos Morton. 

"Los Vendidos," a 30-minute aclO, 
exposes the Mexican-American who 
denies his heritage. The audience is 
greeted by the proprietor of Honest 
Sancho's Used Mexican and Curio 
Shop, when a "vendida," Ms. Jimenez, 
enters the shop and asks for a "Mexi-
can type" to work in her adminstra-
tion. Sancho introduces her to three 
"models," a farmworker, a gang 
member or " pachuco," and an exam-
ple of a Mexican revolutionary of 
1910, to work in her bureaucracy. 

" Each character is a reflection of 
our own biases and stereotypes, as 
Sancho parades the characters before 
Ms. Jimenez, who is looking for 
'token' workers," Huerta said . 

In "Johnny Tenorio," the setting is 
Big Berta 's Cant ina , located in a bar-
r io in the Southwest. Johnny Tenorio 
returns to his fa vorite hangout only to 
find there is little d ifference between 
the living and the dead . His past deeds 
flash before him in this retelling of the 
classic Don Juan leitmoti f. 

Huerta said , "Morton 's dark vision 
of machismo and colonization is grip-
ping in its pathos and vivid in its 
reconstruction of a life gone sour." 
Morton is a graduate of the UCSD 
Department of Theatre playwriting 

BLOOM C:OUNTY 

program, and second only to Valdez in 
the production and publication of 
Chicano theatre works. Morton has 
had two plays produced by Joe Papp's 
"Festival Latino," in New York City. 

The en emble is being sponsored by 
various groups, including the Ameri-
can Embassy in Paris, UCSD, and 
European in titution which will be 
hosting them in nine different cities. 
.. Additional funding must come from 
our performances here in California 
before the ensemble leaves for Europe. 
This part is crucial ," Huerta said. 

Study investigates Neo-
Mull-Soy and Cho Free 

Children between the ages of 7 and 
12 who as infa nts were fed either of 
two oy ba e products, eo-Mull-Soy 
or Cho Free, are sought for a research 
study to assess their language skills . 

The Syntex Corporation products 
were made without sufficient chloride, 
which sometimes led to metabolic dis-
orders and failufe to thrive. It is 
believed that some infants may have 
sustained brain damage either as a 
re ult of the metabolic disorders 
and / or lack of sufficient chloride in 
the formula . 

Parents who used one of these for-
mulas will likely remember the distinc-
ti ve orange and blue cans, which fea-
tures ducks on the label. 

According to Merle Irvin, peech-
language pathologist at the UCSD 
Communicative and Cognitive Dis-
orders Center, ome infants may have 
sustained brain damage who typically 
demonstrate normal intelligence but 
often have developmental delays. The 
UCSD stud y will specifically address 
problems with word-retrieval abilities. 

For the study children will be 
administered intelligence and picture / -
vocabulary tests in a three-hour ses-
sion . There is no charge to the family 
and a summary of test results will be 
provided . 

Parents whose children took Noe-
Mull-Soy or Cho Free infant formula 
between 1976 and 1980 who are inter-
ested in participating in the study 
should call Merle Irvin or Diane 
Yapko at the UCSD Communicative 
and Cognitive Disorders Center at 
294-6330 . 

Video Stroke Analysis 
for swimmers 
I mprovement in any sport comes with 
both practice and individualized 
coaching. If you are an intermediate to 
advanced swimmer who wishes to 
improve your stroke, Video Stroke

Golding blasts O~Connor 
Says people "are looking for an alternative" 

By LETICIA VILLARREAL 
Staff Writer 

Susan Golding, San Diego County Supervi-
sor and possible mayoral candidate, spoke 
Tuesday night to the UCSD College Republi-
cans at the International Center. She addressed 
questions regarding Mayor Maureen O'Con-
nor, her thoughts about running for mayor, 
about AIDS and the 'gay bathhouse' ordi-
nance , which she proposed . 

"I can only say that I wouldn't even be con-
sidering running[for mayor] if I hadn't literally 
been ... deluged by phone calls and letters ask-
ing me to run ," she said, when asked for her 
opinions of Mayor O'Connor's performance in 
office, adding that she wished that would 
happen every time she ran. 

"There is a tremendous disillusionment in 
the community," she continued, "a feeling of 
lack of leadership and ... the lack of the ability 
to tackle hard problems and be forthright 
about it." 

She claimed that there were "politically 
active" segments of the community that once 
supported O'Connor but do no want to support 
her in the next election and are "looking for an 
alterative . " 

"I would say that these are democratic 
strongholds as well as republican," she added . 

"They're supporting me publicly but they're 
waiting to see what I decide." 

There are very few elected officials in thi 
community that can even talk to her ," she 
stated when the subject turned to O'Connor 
herself, "and that does not create a cohesive 
kind of leadership . She says she knows what 
she's doing and she works behind the scenes, 
but the truth is that in any elected office, work-
ing behind the scenes only goes so far - if in 
fact that is what is going on." 

Golding was asked what she thought about 
O'Connor's endorsement of Senator Alan 
Cranston during his 1986 re-election campaign 
against Ed Zschau. "I think when someone 
makes a campaign commitment not to endorse 
in partisan races and turns around very shortly 
afterwards and endorses, it draws into question 
what other commitments meant ." 

The "bathhouse issue" dominated the discus-
sion, since it was Golding who first proposed 
the ordinance barring bathhouses in the city of 
San Diego and unincorporated areas. Golding 
stressed that she did not consider the issue as 
solely a gay bathhouse issue, and claimed that 
the legislation was not intended to single out 
the gay community. 

It was an issue of bathhouses in general , she 
said, and "any other establishment which 
fosters behavior that spreads AIDS." @) 

Campus peace institute 
receives $300,000 grant 
By A, BEZZERIDES 

With the goal of resolving 
international conflicts and estab-
lishing world peace, the John D. 
and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation has recently renewed 
a $300,000 grant to the I nstit~te 
on Global Conflict and Cooper-
ation (lGCC), headquartered at 
UCSD. 

The IGCC, which was estab-
lished in 1983 by Herbert York, a 
former chancellor of UCSD, 
focuses on concerns of interna-
tional cooperation and works 
with conflicts which threaten 
world peace. Although York is 
currently on sabbatical, he is still 
very much involved in the direc-

IOrship of IGCC. 
The MacArthur Foundation, 

located in Chicago, shares the 
same interests as IGCC. Some of 
the many programs the founda-
tion supports include ones in 
education, peace and interna-
tional cooperation. 

The foundation first gave 
\GCC a $300,000 grant in 1985 
after being considered by a board 
of directors from its peace and 
international cooperation pro-
gram. This grant was used to 
fund both faculty research and 
gradullte student fellowships for 
studies at universities around the 
world in the area of publicI for-
eign policy. . 

In accordance with its goals of 

resolving international conflic;ts, 
especially those in the third world, 
the MacArthur Foundation re-
newed the grant to \Gce. With 
the new grant , IGCC plans to 
continue studying conflict situa-
tions that might lead to nuclear 
war and the policies and institu-
tions that would either manl).ge 
or eliminate these conflicts. 

According to a spokesperson, 
the MacArthur Foundation 
wants to see funding used for 
serious and interesting programs 
which encourage international 
understanding. The foundation 
feels that by funding programs at 
the university level , focus will be 
put on "shaping the new genera-
tion of policy makers ." [ill

Pigs in the Wilderness 

"Where are they now?" I a ked him." "Gone," he said . 
Mo t of them are dead, and the others either got locked 
up or went crazy ." - An evening in Milwaukee. 

Last night I hot the computer. One blast from the little .410 killed 
it in tantly. The screen exploded. wires fused , circuits burned and the 
room filled with . our electrical smoke . 

After that I hot the main telephone, t he big one with all the 
buttons. It had been causing me a lot oft rouble. There were too many 
special features that I never quite got the hang of. On any given night 
I could call the same number 60 or 70 times and never know I was 
doing it. The "sen itivity" button squelched all noise on my end, and 
a touch on the "privacy knob" made it impossible for anybody on the 
other end to hear a word I was aying . I thought they were deaf or 
drunk . It wa like being in [gyp!. 

It wa a wrong and evil machine, so I killed it. Maria wa on the 
other line. at the time. and he was frightened to hear gunshot and 
the ound ofexplodinggla s. "Don't worry," I told her. "These walls 
are packed with spun rubber. and the other side i all book helves." 

Which was true. The blast had been absorbed by five or six 
volume : "Ulysse ," "eosell," "The Joy of Lesbian Sex," "A Fan's 

otes ." and a huge trange tome called "Thinking and Destiny," an 
underground class ic of ort s that has challenged something like 26 
million mind and won every time. It is not a quick read : nine 'or 10 
month is about average. The only real demand for it comes from 
pri on libraries and long-range nuclear submannes. 

, obod y reads anymore. Money and music are the only real form 
of communication these days. Newspapers are becoming like the last 
fam ily of condor . Jerry Garcia or even Leonard Cohen speak to 
more people than William Randolph Hearst or Jo eph Pulit7cr ever 
dreamed of reaching. 

T he last time I was in Milwaukee I asked a man who approached me in one of the local parking lots around midnight what had become of the wild boys and speed freaks and true outlaw 
bikers who used to handle security at the original SDS rallies in 
towns like Madi on. Milwaukee and Chicago. 

They were a strange and crazy elite on the far edge of the Harley-
Davison culture, which traditionally despised and hated everyt hing 
that left-bent crazies and radicals in a new gang like OS represented . 

My friend Teddy wa one of them . He had hairdo\;n to the middle 
of his back and rode a bored-out black Sportster that was almost as 
fast as the big Honda and Kawasakis . 

And he was very qu ick with it , running throttle screwed all the way 
over at all times: 95 o r96 in the White Lane, that thin little strip down 
the middle which is fast enough in traffic, with 10 or 12 pounds of 
c rystal speed around your wa ist in a green Army-surplus bell. And he 
li ked his work In a wa y that was very pure and straight and very 
comfortable, about 96 percent of the time . 

Some were d umb, some were greedy, and other ran red light at 90 
mph o n stripped-d o \\n , bo red-out Honda Super Hawks and split 
t heir skulls against big blue Oldsmobiles. 

T hose were the o nes who d idn't know the difference between 96 
a nd 100, which is not a bad margin in this world. But the numbers 
ha ve changed ince them: by the end of the '60s it was down to 70 out 
of 100; and in the '70s, the ME Generation , the margin shrank 
drastically. 

I he WIld boys were fi nally bei ng phased out. eil Cassady died on 
the railroad tracks in Mexi co. The action moved to Wall Street and 
the law school s. The sound of bald tires rolling fast into your drive-
way at 3 0 ' clock in the morning was NOT what you wanted to hearif 
you had to go to work at 8:30 . 

I spent about 13 minutes talking to that rna? in the ~arking lot in Milwaukee . He had been down to Kesey s place 111 La Honda once or twice, and he said he remembered those nights with a 
sharpness that made his life si nce then seem vaguely out offocus. He 
had somehow drifted away from the world and the people who used 
to make his blood move fast. 

"Where are they now?" I asked him . 
"Gone," he said . • , Most of them are dead , and the others either got 

locked up or went crazy." 
By 1977 or 78 , in the st range vacuum of failure and distracted 

angst that followed Watergate, t he numbers were down to 66 or even 
55. J immy Carter was making a shambles of the first real democratic 
breakthrough si nce 1960 , and the long cold arm of the law was 
beginning to grab and punish people who didn't understand . 

I n the '60s it was chic to be the right kind of criminal. You could get 
rich and famous by committing, or even confessing, to crimes that 
were fashionable at the time. onny Barger became a folk hero, along 
with Tim Leary, Ken Kesey a nd the infamous D .B. Cooper. 

That's a very long story, and we don't have time for it now. All we 
really need to know is that the only certified innocent man in the 
public dock today is John DeLorean , who ha s been formally acq uit-
ted of all cha rges. 

As for Teddy. he went to Japan and used his drug profits to buy the 
patent on those sleazy little rubber spiders that children ni ng agai nst 
a wall and then watch them walk their way, by suction, down its face . 
He made $22 million in three years and now lives in a huge penthouse 
on the Gold Coast of Chicago where he gambles heavi ly on De mo-
cratic politics. 

Criminals will always be with us, like the poor and the crazy and 
mean women who look sweet in the dim light of cheap meatrack 
rooms. But the lighting was a bit different back then, or maybe it was 
just the mu ic.

Paramedics 
Save Lives 
Editor: 

I'd like to comment on Jackie 
Kermani's article, "UCS D Heals 
in Hillcrest" (Guardian. Feb. 4). 
Considering that the UCSD 
Medical Center wa s recently 
ranked as one of the top hospi-
tals in the nation, I'm amazed 
that your newpaper does not 
devote more energy into explor-
ing what i happening there. 

The writer's biggest blunder 
comes in the state ment that 
.. .. . paramedicsjust take accident 
victims to the hospital without 
administering treatment." Tha t 
would be kind oflike saying that 
staff writers just deliver the 
newspapers without wri ting 
what's in them. The author 
should have realized that the 
treatment capabilities aboard the 
helicopter and aboard the para-
medic ambulance are almost 
identical. Paramedics in Sa n 
Diego County have an enormous 
responsibility in the field (out-
side of the hospital), and have 
the capabilities to begin cou nt-
less lifesaving procedures. 

I think the UCSD Medical 
Center deserves better in terms 
of news coverage, and I think we, 
as the UCS D community, deserve 
better in terms of quality and 
factual journalism.

Panda 
Abuse 
Editor: 

I'm writing in response 
to Kathleen Donahue'S 
recent article entitled 
"Pandering to the bears" 
(Guardian. Feb. I). I must 
confess: I'm one ofthe two 
million people who have 
viiited tbe San Diego Zoo 
to see the pandas. Having 
already seen the panda 
exhibit at the National Zoo 
in Washington D.C., I went 
to the San Diego Zoo 
expecting a similar exhibit . 

J was shocked at how 
different the two exhibits 
were. The pandas at the 
National Zoo (free admis-
sion) are presented as pan-
das: they're basically left 
alone to eat and sleep and 
be pandas. At the San 
Diego Zoo (58.50 admis-
sion), they're presented not 
as pandas, but as circus per-
formers for the crowd. 

It was difficult to watch 
an exhausted panda climb 
into a tiny chair built for 
humans, then be made to 
sit like a human, and then 
take from one of the 
panda-tamers a lifelike 
human baby doll to cradle 
in its arms and lick the 
doll's face with its lonaue, 
while the crowd oohed and 
ahhed. Isn't that a little 
perverse? 

I am chaarined but not 
surprised tbat SaD Dicpns 
tolerate such cruelty and 
hypocrisy. After all, this 
town is also home to Sea 
World, where killer whales, 
dolphins and other crea-
tures suffer similar fate •. 

I can only hope that these 
panda. find a better fate 
when they return home to 
China.

Dr. Gonzo 
And Mr. 
Thompson 
By MICHAEL MARTINEZ 
Staff Writer 

When the word hit the streets 
that the syndicated column of 
Hunter . Thompson would be 
appearing in the Guardian. [ 
asked one of our writers what he 
thought of the Doctor of Gon-
zology. " I'm not comfortable," 
he admitted, "knowing that 
Hunter Thompson is on the same 
co ntinent. " 

Well , yes - and he re we go 
again. This sentiment aptly de-
fines the tragic flaw in the legend 
of Hunter Stockton Thompson. 
The fine line that separates the 
grotesque caricature Dr. Gonzo 
from the legitimate journalist 
Hunter Thompson has been blur-
red for so long that much of his 
current audience, and e pecially 
hi detractors, is unaware a line 
ever existed. 

Eve n in his early six ties work, 
Thompson's view of the world 
seemed to be from an orbit all his 
own . His later involvement with 
the Hell's Angels, the Haight-
Ashbury scene and the Chicago 
demonstrations at the '68 Demo-
cratic Convention further shaped 
his alienation from the world of 
straight journalism. His inven-
tion of "Gonzo Journalism" at 
the 1970 Kentucky Derby was 
inadvertent, born out of writer's 
block and chemical abuse. Gonzo 
didn 't allow for draft and re-
write , and might devote as much 
space to personal consumption, 
exaggerat ions, and marginal tan-
gents as to the su bject at hand . 
Try to imagine a writer who 
could expose the transparency of 
the "new" Richard ixon with 
the same effort and eloquence he 
devotes to a morning breakfast 
of margaritas, mushrooms and 
cocai ne. 

Once Hunter built this mons-
ter, he continued exploiti ng it 
throughout the '70s. H is stream 
of consciousness avaged the 
guilt, fear, loathing and other 
foibles of our politics, pro foot-
ball , the Rich and Greedy, and 
many more. Here was a Don 
Quixote who tilted at more than 
a few lousy windmills. 

It's been often noted that 
Hunter Thompson's large and 
devoted cult consists mostly of 
people who first became attract-
ed to gossip about his lifestyle 
and then explored his work. Un-
fortunately , the gossip remained 
the substance for many. An in-
teresting footnote to the legend 
is in the inevitable, almost sub-
conscious use of ersatz H unter-
isms by writers profiling him. 
"Pacing the stage like a caged 
tiger on benzedrine" is a recent 
example. 

With Thompson 's recent ap-
pcarance at ymphony Hall and 
the obligatory skewering in the 
Union, the beat does indeed go 
on. With the crowd sc reaming 
for the Monster, Hunter sham-
bled on-stage late and insisted on 
speaking in a high-velocit·y mum-
ble . He was bombarded by heck -
lers, tossed a football, stalked 
around in a huff, talked about 
cashing his paycheck . In short, a 
vintage Hunter. A snalZY blonde 
and her well-heeled fixer couldn't 
translate hi gibberish and left in

education by actually supplying 
educational services, publicly-
funded vouchers would be given 
to the parents of school-age 
children to spend at the school of 
their choice. This plan would 
give poor and lower- to middle-
income parents the choice of 
sending their children to private 
or public schools, a choice they 
don't have under the present sys-
tem. Naturally, this plan would 
mean a complete restructuring 
of the educational system. Maybe 
genuine competition from the 
private sector is just what Amer-
ican public education needs to 
turn it around from its present 
descent into utter mediocrity. 

Rather than simply proposing 
large increases in money allo-
cated to education, as the 
Democrats and the NEA are 
prone to do, the republican can-
didates are proposing creative 
plans to improve the state of 
education. George Bush and Bob 
Dole both favor a plan of tax-
free savings for children'S tui-
tion. Bush's proposal is the Col-
lege Saving Bond plan. This plan 
would enable parents to make 

The most interesting proposal 
comes from longshot candidate, 
and former Delaware governor, 
Pierre du Pont. Du Pont is 
advocating an educational 
voucher system, similar to that 
first proposed by Pulitzer Prize-
winning economist Milton Fried-
man back in the 1950s. The idea 
behind educational vouchers is 
rather straightforward. Instead 
of the government financing Bill Ellers

The Polikoffs believed that

their own snit. Others strutted in 
period costumes from The Leg-
end of the Monster. It was Cir-
cus Circus, and even Hunter 
called it "feeding time at the 
ZOO." 

Some of the question were 
certainly a revelation. Giddy 
water heads needed to know if he 
really took acid with John Chan-
cellor or shot Linda Ronstadt's 
poodles. A few self-righteous 
Sixties diehards insisted on using 
gratuitous profanity and deman-
ded to know what Thompson 
was doing with his life, and why 
was he selling out by writing for 
The San Francisco examiner. 

Unfortunately, not many ex-
hibit a grasp beyond the obvious. 
Hunter S. Thompson is not, 
strictly speaking, an aural expe-
rience. Anyone who dishes out 
fifteen bucks for a "lecture" by 
Hunter Thompson gets what he 
deserves. He's an intangible sen-
sation, whether by his presence 
in a room or by the cumulative 
effect of his words and meta-
phors after you've read them. It's 
not important that you believe 
Ed Muskie took ibogaine, or 
that Richard Nixon was eaten by 
White Cannibals. That's typical 
Hunter hyperbole. It's important 
that you feel the despair and 
ineptness of Muskie's 1972 pre-
sidential campaign or sense the 
void in America's passion for 
democracy after the Nixon years. 

Hunter S. Thompson is an 
enigma - his name should be one 
of its definitions in Webster s 
Dictionary. He may be too out-
rageous for so me tastes , hope-
lessly anachronistic, a greedy 
hustler in his own right. I don't 
care if he's living with wolves - as 
long as he still possesses idea 
and motivation and the motor 
ski lls necessary to put pen to 
paper. If he's out there creech-
ing in the wilderne , I'll be 
listening. [!J

though the hospital was then 
aware of the AIDS risk inherent 
in blood transfusions. A San 
Diego V A spokeswoman said 
that the hospital could not com-
ment on the case because of

A spokeswoman for the San 
Diego Blood Bank said that in

"We don't care where we get [the 
money]," he told the Los Angeles 
Times . "It's the money that we're 
after. "

By MJCHELLE BIDWELL 
S taff Writer 

A merica n must "free blacks a nd white of the false image of the past" 
t hrough education, Lero ne Ben-
nett J r., a senior editor of £bon\' 
magazine said at a UCSD lecture 
las t Saturday. 

Bennett proposed that we, as 
America ns, "d eal wi th the his-
tory we have made, for it is his-
tory . It i lavery. egregation , 
sharecro pping, racism, unequal 
pay, unequal treat ment [and] 
Klanism violence." 

A renowned journali t , poet. 
historian, and social critic, Ben-
nett has also written severa l 
books regard ing the his tory of 
black America ns. H is lecture. 
give n in honor of black history 
mo nth was entitled "The Rele-
va nce of Black History." Bennett 
foc used on the argument that 
" the black experience is so inex-
t rica bly intertwined wi th t he 
great for ming poi nts of the 

Lerone Bennett: 
black and white 
share America's 

past together 
America n ex perience that it is 
impossi ble to understand white 
history without some und er-
sta nd ing of black hi tory." 

Bennett added tha t, for far too 
long, the his tory of the United 
Sta tes has been recorded and 
interpreted as a white hi tory, 
often denyi ng the funda mental 
co nt ri but io ns of th e " black 
ex p e r ie nce" to th e overall 
ma keup of the United tates. 

"The point here is, a nd the 
poi nt is si mple , that black his-
tory is a central com ponent of 
American history and cannot be 
understood or redeemed wit hout 
a confrontation with the black 
gift to America," Bennet t said . 

In echoi ng the words of the 
fa mous black leader, W.E.B. 
Dubo is, Bennett described these 
gifts as "the gift of story and song 
. .. t he gift of sweat a nd brawn 
[a nd] a gift of the spir it. " As 
exa mples, Bennett cited various 
black America ns, both famous 
a nd not-so fa mous, a nd the 
impo rta nt co ntribut ions these 

people have made to America. 
He mentioned Frederick Dou-
glas , Ha rriet Tubman, Martin 
Luther King, J r., Duke Ell ing-
to n and even Dr. J . 

Wh ile commending the many 
co nt ri but ion made by black 
Americans to the history of the 
United Sta tes, Bennett a lso 
a rgued that "black history is 
threatened as it has never been 
threa tened before in the United 
Sta te by a resurgence of . . . Jim 
C ro wis m masquerading a s con-
servati sm. " 

Reaction at the highest levels 
of American society has made 
racism respectable again , and 
the bigots we thought we had 
defeated forever . ... are coming 
out of the woodwork again." 

Bennett charged that racism is 
apparent in the fields of sports, 
academia , and especially among 
the economic and political insti-
tutions. Bennett even explained 
that after he had heard a speech 
by the President , he concluded 

that "jt was dear . . . that Ronald 
Reagan had no idea in the world 
that this country was founded on 
what Abraham Lincoln called 
"the 250 years of unrequited toil 
of black men and women." 

In the latter half of his lecture, 
Bennett defined several "tasks," 
a s he called them, of the Ameri-
can people. Bennett proposed 
that there be a creation of "a 
common history," not an inte-
gration of black history into the 
already defined white history. 
Bennett stressed that history 
must be look at from an entirely 
new perspective - from the 
perspective of all experiences, 
black, white, and brown. 

In dealing with this history, 
Bennett said that we must also 
confront racism and the "spirit 
of slavery and segregation that is 
still alive and well and walking 
the streets of America." 

Bennett stressed the im-
portance the role of education 
plays in erasing false ideas of the

Stuffy waiting rooms, scream-ing sick child ren a nd frus-trated adults a re often the 
images tha t come to mind when 
one th inks back on childhood 
doctor visits. But when Dr. Doris 
Howell's pat ient s grow up a nd 
think upon this same theme, 
t hey'l most li kely remember vis-
it ing a quiet olllce In the early 
evening hours and playin g with 
toys while thei r parents co nsult 
an incredib ly warm a nd sympa-
thetic doctor. 

She found this fact very dis-
turbing because people "don't 
know how to be a parent. " She 
feels the important thing is that 
parents understand the various 
stages in thei r child 's develop-
ment. That way the parents know 
what to expect as a child grows 
up and are then able to prevent 
accidents their child might oth-
erwise have .. "The most common 
cause of death in all children is

they can do anyth ing. It's heart-

past. He suggested that parents 
need to surround children with 
multi-racial images and that 
educational institutions must 
teach the truth about. what Ben-
nett calls , "our collect ive 
history. " 

Bennett explained that black 
students at the universities need 
to be "challenged and motivated" 
instead of being "intimidated by 
the . .. myth . .. that they can't do 
this and they can't do that." 

Although Bennett focused 
mainly on the significance of 
black history to overall Ameri-
can history, he expanded his 
general arguments to include all 
ethnic backgrounds. "We are 
coinheritors of the same histori-
cal space [and] there is no way in 
the world we could be free of one 
another ... we are condemned by 
history to walk this road together. 
And , there is no way to help or 
hurt or save one group without 
helping or hurting or saving 
another," Bennett said. (Q) 

Such pleasurable memories 
begi n at Howell 's ped iat ric clinic 
which is open at t he Student 
Healt h Center for three eve nings 
eve ry week. Desig ned to help 
student-pa rents ca re for their 
child ren , t he clinic provides 
health care tha t is bot h conve-
nient and affo rdable. 

The ped iatric clinic is espe-
cially designed for student-par-
ents who a re possi bly without 
transportation or lacking the 
fund s for go od health care . 
Howell wants to educate under-
graduat e a nd graduate student s 
alike on how to get insurance 
a nd ca re for thei r child - some-
th ing t hat she fee ls is a necessi ty. 

Dr. Howell gives s keptical 4 month -old Andrew Kimme l a s mile of e ncouragement. 

J ust over two years ago , How-
ell fou nd that ped iatric care was 
great ly needed at UCSD. At that 
time, Howell was chairman of 
the advi ory committee for the 
Student Health Center. She got 
feedback from some of the stu-
dents on the co mm ittee tha t 
many parents d id n't have healt h 
care for their children . "They 
just hoped kids stayed well. A lot 
of them d idn 't get healt h care," 
Howell ob~erved . 

"This is a free cli nic, most ly a 
preventive a nd pr imary care 
clinic. " If the children need 
urge nt or emergency ca re How-
ell will "send [them] to the Uni-
versity hosp ital and they will 
[provide care] at the lowest po~­
sible price." 

R ight now the clinic cares for 
a bout 230 pat ient s. Howell usu-
ally sees about fo ur pat ien ts each 
night. Patients must have a p-
pointments, but she said , " We'd 
love tha t a ny student that need 

help can call us. We can expand 
and let them know what we can 
do .. . . We can't gi ve a kind of 
round the clock care but we can 
make sure that they get ca re." 

In th e first year of operat ion, 
the cli n ic was run by Howell and 
eight econd-yea r med ica l stu-
dent volu nteers . This year there 
have been 36 s uch volu nt.eers. 
Because of the active involve-
ment of the med s tudents , H ow-
ell decided to incorpora te a med-
ical student teaChing fac il ity into 
the clinic. Wh ile she educate the 
parents on p reven tive med ici ne 
for their child ren Howell also 
educate the stude nts on how to 
t rea t children . 

A typical examination begins 
with the medical student exa-
mining the child after getting his 
or her medical history from the 
parents. The medical student 
the n repeats this information to 
Howell a nd the parents so tha t 
a ll a re invol ved in the steps of the 
exa m. With this process there 
a re "no secrets. Eve ry body's in 
he re togethe r . ... Everybod y's 
learning," Ho well said . 

a roline Kimm el and he r 
hu band Hans are gradua te stu -
dents at UCS 0 , who had nothing 
but praise for Howell and the 
program. " I heard a bo ut the 
cli n ic and Dr. Howell and read 
ho w grea t she is to keep the pro-

gram going .... All the students 
are very nice and knowledgea-
ble." Caroline said that unlike 
going to a regular doctor's office 
the children like to come "to see 
her [Dr. Howell] and play. The 
program's really great." Hans 
added . " For no financ ial ri sk, 
the baby get s the bes t care it can

Students get free money 
By VAN HUTCHINSON 
Staff W,ite, 

General Ulysses S. Grant was sa id to ha ve ridde n a donkey backwards tQ win 
a bet and prove a point. If a U .S . 
Grant is to be found on the 
UCSD campus, it is not uch a 
backward affair. 

Undergraduate Scholastic 
Grants is an A.S . organi7..ation 
which receives it s mandate and 
funding from the Chancellor's 
Committee on I nstructiona I 
Improvement Programs. 

U.S. Grants provides funds of 
up to $500 for student projects, 
such as lab research , library 
research, and art / V.A. projects. 

David Orozco, the director of 
U.S . Grants said , " One of the 
main purposes [of the grant pro-
gram] is to teach students how to 

w~ite grant proposals." Orozco, 
a Revelle senior who has worked 

o 

D 

with U.S . Grants for three years , also said that without this kind offunding, many students wou ld 
have no way to pursue creative research and projects. 

A statement about the program in The Journal of Undergraduate Research asserted , "U.S . 
Grants is concerned with the tendency of students to passively consume facts presented to them in 
lectures or textbooks rather than to actively explore and challenge theories and assumptions 
through their own research." Clearly, funding is a powerful incentive to pursue learning outside of 
the classroom - learning by doing. 

In past quarters , much of U.S. Grants' monies have been allocated to video and film projects . 
Orozco said that U.S . Grants had $5,300 to allocate this fall . Eighty-three percent of this amount 
went to visual arts projects. The rest went to AMES and EECS projects as well as biology and 
biochemistry projects. A smattering went to research papers in humanities and social sciences. 

In his three years with U.S . Grants, Orozco has seen a lot of proposals . "One of the more 
impressive proposals was submitted by Rico Martinez. We funded him for several quarters [on 
film projects]. From there he went on to win an internship with the TV show " Moonlighting," over 
the summer. '" 

Not all proposals receive funding, however. "If it's not well-written and well thought-out, it 
won't receive funding," Orozco said . Continuing, he said, "One person wanted to make a mural 
here and then send parts of it all over South America." Nice idea: but no dice. 

"Another wanted to make a large mural out of dozens of those exosketch machines, the ones 
with the two knobs you turn and make a picture . .. We didn't have that kind of money, so we 
suggested [that] he go see the company which makes them. They gave them all to him , and he put 
them up in a place on campus. " 

Orozco concluded that successful awards go to students who know their subject-area well and 
who have done their homework. 

The process of applying for a grant is not simple, but it is straighforward . 
First , one needs to attend an information session during the quarter before the project, typically 

during 9th or 10th week. Together with a faculty adviser, one should design a very detailed plan, 
specifying the goals of the anticipated project. One needs also to make a step-by-step or week-by-

~chedule of activities. 
One must then get price quotes on all materials and services necessary for the project , such as 

photocopying paper, film, rentals, miscellaneous supplies, etc. At least three different stores or 
suppliers should be called to get the lowest quotes on prices . 

Expenses such as travel, entertainment, postage, and expensive tools and equipment are not 
funded . 

Finally, you must make 12 copies of the proposal and su bmit them by Tuesday of the second 
week in the quarter of your project. 

A panel of past grant recipients and a reviewer affiliated with the A.S . looks over all the 
proposals, which have been labeled anonymously. After recommending some of them for fund-
ing, the U.S . Grants office then decides the exact amount each proposal will receive.

According to Howell , the rea-

expend more time." This yeal'\ 
she has gotten some assistants -
doctors who volunteer their time,

Condom Awareness Week ••••••••••••••••••••• : HAIRCUT SPECIAL : 
By DAVID BROOKS 
Guardia" I"tern 

T hi s week marks the fourth year that VCSD has par-ticipated in the unofficial 
Condom Awareness Week. Since 
Monday, students working in 
conjunction with the Student 
Health Service have been pass-
ing out condoms and brochures 
detailing safe sex procedures. 

quently , this was the first year 
that the universit y had to pur-
chase condoms for the program . 
The cost of the over 1,000 con-
doms came out of the Student 
Health Service budget. 

Compared to past years, this 

year's Condom Awareness Week 
has been quite extensive. Volun-
teers at information tables dis-
tributed condoms and brochures 
in front of the bookstore , at 
Peterso n Hall, and at Revelle 
and Muir ca mpuses. IQ]

According to Chri O ak ley, a 

Health Educator with the Stu-
dent Health Service, the purpo e 
of the awareness week is to " let 
people know how to get co n-
doms a nd how to properly use 
the d evices." Oakley indicated 
that many st udents are aware 
that condom greatly decrea e 
the cha nce of AIDS and Sexu-
ally Tran mitted Di seases 
(STDs) yet many are unable to 
"apply wha t th ey know to real 
lifc practices." 

T he misconception that AIDS 
. has not yet see ped into the hete-
rosexua l population is slowly 
bei ng erased . With some studies 
predicting that AIDS will 
become the leading cause of 
death for Americans in the 20 to 
29 age group, condom use has 
skyrocketed. It is estimated that 
women now purchase 40 percent 
of all condoms in fact, so many 
condoms were purchased this 
year that companies which nor-
mally donate large numbers of 
their product to universities did 
not have enough in stock to 
make these donations. Conse-

Staff Writer 

With only even upperclass-
men on this year's UCSD men's 
varsi ty baseball team, one would 
assume that Head Coach Lyle 
Yates has a difficult task ahead 
of him with a you ng and inexpe-
rienced team . With about 80 
percent of the team of under-
graduate tatus. they can cer-
tainly be considered young. But 

boasts a club that is excellent 
defen ively (he pointed out that 
this year's infield is is the best 
defensive one that UCS 0 has 
ever had) and one that is scrappy 
enough to poke out enough runs 
to win the baJJ game . 

"We're not going to overpower 
anybody this year by 12-2 and 
11-1 scores," Yates said. "We'll 
probably win games by 4-2 scores 
and the like." Judging from 
Yates' general outlook for his 

double plays . 
"We're not a power-hitting 

clu b," the even year coach said 
of his offense. "We're trying to 
focus on bat control and offen-
sive execution this season, par-
ticularly bunting and hit and run 
situations ... 

This style of play can make for 
a very aggressive and scrappy 
team. As a result , the team has 
been developing something of a 
motto for the year: "You can't 

Triton Tidbits 

Women's Tennis 
ranked no. 1 with 
3-0 record 
UCSD's women' tennis team 

is about to embark on what head 
coach Liz LaPlante considers to 
be the most crucial matches of 
the season. 

On Feb. 12. the women Trit-
on will play C lare mont-Mudd-
Scripps a nd will move on to 
Pomona Pitzer on Feb. 13. Both 
matches, along with a future 
meeting with Occidental College, 
will be crucial determinants in 
the womens' chances of defend -
ing their title in the NCAA 
nationals this spring. 

The Tritons are currently 
ranked number one in the most 
recent poll of coaches and are 

. undefeated against their compe-
tition. Since the beginning of the 
season, the Tritons have only 
lost one individual match out of 
27 total, shutting out Redlands 
University and CSU Northridge 
9-0 and beating Point Lorna 
Nazarene 8- I last week . 

Sophomore Christine Behren 
returns to her number one spot 

in singles and is curre ntly 3-0 in 
her matches . Behrens suffered 
from shin splints toward the end 
of last year so her recerit perfor-
mances are a good sign of her 
recovery. Rhonda Meier main-
tains the number two singles 
spot , with a record of 2-1. Julie 
Berman, Janet Whalen, Susa n 
Carney and K ri ten Diels fill in 
the rest of the roster, each with a 
3-0 record to date. 

In doubles , all three teams are 
undefeated. The number one 
team is comprised of Behrens 
and Meier, Diels and Whalen 
make up the second team and 
Carney and Berman combine to 
make the number three doubles 
team.

Although the team's record (3-
3) might indicate trouble, head 
coach John Hammermeister is 
still confident in his team.

they trounced California Luthe-

"There is no question that

this year's team," Yates menti-

staff was ranked second na-

our best pitchers are returning." 
To complement this staff. Yates

10-1 rout was evidently an 
exception. 

Centerfielder Gary Fe sia's

never looked back. Starting 
pitcher Rick owak picked up 
the victory with five scoreless 
innings of one-hit ball, and right-
fielder Chris Murphy ripped a 
grand slam in the six-run fourth . 
In addition , second baseman 
Thad Ferre went 3 for 5 and con-
tributed 3 RBI , while the solid 
defensive infield turned four 

fault 'em for being aggressive." 
This aggressive attitude stems 

from a whole slew of players who 
don't possess a tremendous 
amount of power but rather a 
load of all around talent and an 
ability to get the job done at any 
cost. 

Aside from junior John Mar-
tinez, one of the top athletes on 
the team and a power-hitter who 
in his first year as a catcher has 
earned the starting job, this is 
not a power-laden team - espe-
cially in comparison with last 
year's club that hit a collective 54

homcruns. Backing Martine7 up 
at catcher is junior Dan Duron , 
who Yates mentioned a being 
the hardest worker on the team 

"the first man on the field and 
the la t man off." 

Surveying the infield, one finds 
sop homore Dave owlan at first 
base, a line-drive hitt er with very 
good ha nds . Senior Thad Ferre, 
a four-year varsity member, will 
be the second baseman, to whom 
Yates credited as having the "best 
hands on the team." 

Junior Brian Crawford , a 
transfer from Santa Barbara ity 
College, will play shortstop . 
According to Yates, Crawford is 
the purest defensive shortstop 
that has ever been in the U D 
baseball program, as indicated 
by his sm:>oth style of play and 
h is great ra nge. 

Third base will be held down 
by freshman Matt Bynum who is 
also a fine defen ive player with 
a good arm . Sophomore John 
Meyers, after he recovers from 

an injury, should compete for a 
spot on the left side of the infield . 
Sophomore Er ik Judson should 
abo sce act io n in a utility ro le. 

In th e outfield , so phomore 
Henry Jimenel will most likely 
be in leftfield . Jimenez is a very 
teady ballplayer who started the 

entire second half of last season 
in right. Backing him up are two 
perennial speedsters, sophomore 
Ric h Simpson and freshman 
Kevin Gelbard .

Cont inued from page t3 

Roaming centerfield will be 
junior Gary Fe sia, a .370 hitter 
la t year who will be hitting in 
the third spot in the order. Fessia 
may also see some action in the 
bullpen. Sophomore Chris 
Murphy, a transfer from the 
baseball factory over at the Uni-
versity of Arizona and the man 
who provided Monday's excite-
ment with the grand slam, will be 
in right field . 

Other outfielders who will 
probably be comi ng off the bench 
include sophomores J.J . Fischer 
and Kevin Willett, the former 
having pop in his bat and the 
strongest arm on the tea m, and 
the latter who can also pi tch and 
may see some action in a re lief 
role this year. 

evertheles , the cornerstone 
of the 1988 Tritons will be their 
pitching staff. The staff is fea -
tured by two pitchers, sopho-
more Kyle Abbott and junior 
Rick Nowak, both of whom fin-
ished among the leader in ERA 
last year with 1.99 and 1.97 marks 
as well as 8-1 and 10-4 won-loss 
records, respectively. Comple-
menting these two are seniors 

Rick Nowak finished with two no-hitters last year. 

Dave Adamson (I I - I career 
record at UCSD) and Mike 
Mo rgan (5-3, .263, 2 saves last 
season). Any number of t hese 
hurler can pitch in relief, and 
will probably be asked to do so 
on occasion. 

Because of the great deal of 
talent , the solid defense , and the 
superb pitching, Yates believes 
his team can return to the West-

ern Regionals and then the Col-
lege World Series, whee they fi n-
ished fifth last year . This year's 
world series will be held in Bris-
tol , Connecticut. 

A victory already under their 
belts, UCSD travels to face 
Occidental in Pasadena on Fri-
day and return home for an 
alumni game on Saturday at I

ROCHE AND ROSS HAVE A SUPER WEEKEND 
Doug Roche and Linda Ross have a 

lot In common, although before this 
weekend they probably didn't know It 
And cOincidentally, It all started with the 
sport of volleyball 

You see, Doug and Linda were cut 
respectively from UCSD Men's and 
Womens volleyball teams dUring pre -
season tryouts Doug, a couple of years 
back, linda this season And It shouldn't 
take any kind of genius to figure out that 
for all Intents and purposes, thel( athletic 
careers were over kaput washed 
up No way, Josel 

In fact, It was Just the beginning of a 
storybook tale that culminated this past 
weekend In the UCSD Superstars AII -
Sports Competition, As newly crowned 
champions of the 13th annual event, 
Roche and Ross can bask In the lime-
light of their tremendous accomplish-
ments It definitely was a super week -
end, and we're not talking about the 
weather either 

Roche a 59 blonde-headed bundle 
of dynamite and a former Superstars 
champ as a sophomore, pulled out all 
stops In his final try at the event HIs 
phenomenal pOint total of 6370 blitzed 
the competition with plenty to spare 

Ross a new student at UCSD, trans-· 
ferlng from Bakersfield CC, opened up 
Just everyones eyes as she qUietly ran , 
Jumped, lifted, and scored her way to a 
new women s record In the Superstars 
event with a near perfect 5903 
performance 

All weekend long It was Ross and 
Roche, Ross and Roche, as they took 
turns holding the lead at the end of each 
Superstar day In Ihe end Roche won 
out with a fabulous last day performance 
that probably even surprised himself 

HIs 5- t 0 leap In the high Jump and his 
first sub-5 minute mile (4 55) clinched 
his second Superstars tille and culmi-
nated In the f,ltlngest 01 fashions a tre-
mendous f,v -year affair with the event 

HIs 23,748 career pOints In the event 
hurdled him over ali -time Superstars 
king Rick Wilbert , and his 6370 smashed 
former Triton basket bailer Randy Ben-
nett's school record of 6198 

In reality, Roche needed every last 
one of those pOints to stay ahead of his 
fast-finishing rival of a year ago, defend-
Ing champ JJ Fisher Consider JJ 's poor 
plight HIS 6240 total would have and 
should have been a new school record 
Fisher's weekend featured a 201 game 
In bowling, a 330-lb bench press, and 
hiS usual off -the -planet mark In the soft-
ball throw (293-ft ) But this time around, 
JJ was destined for a tough runnerup 
finish 

Ross, on the other hand, Just couldn't 
stop cranking out one great mark after 
another She set two Individual Super-
stars events records with a 165-lb mark 
In welghtllftlng and a sensational 558 
time In the mile run, breaking a 10-year 
old Superstars mark for women Linda's 
5903 total broke LaUrie OConnell's one-
year old mark by a cool 71 pOints 

This year's competition featured a 
record 30 ,nd,v,dual competitors, 26 01 
whom finished the event Seventeen 01 
them went over the 5000-polnt barrier 
which eaSily established this Superstars 
event as the most competitive ever held 

One who didn 't make It to 5000 was 
the venerable Superstars warhorse, 
Henry 'I'll graduate In 1994" Chang 
Henry hammered out hiS usual 4925 for 
the umpteenth year In a row and yes 
olks, he Will be back In 89 

Henry's contribution to the Robert 
Vacheron-Ied Barnyard Etiquette wasn't 
enough as Barnyard failed In ItS bid to 
be the first three-time team champion In 
Superstars Their efforts fell short to 
Glen Creswell's Bakersfield Bandits 
(Creswell, Linda Ross, and Mary Beth 
Murray) whose t 3 925 POints prOVided 
more than enough to outdistance 
Barnyard

PENETRATION AT MIDFIELD - Coed A Soccer 
ThiS Bud Team of the Week goes to a powerhouse Coed A soccer 

team. Penetration at MIdfield is 5-0 on the season and have their 
minds set on a championship. 

The pace for this game was set by Ty Ybaben, who scored two goals in 
a dominant first half. The second half proved to be exciting, with the 
opponents determined not to let this one Slip by, Phenomenal defenSive 
plays by team captain Lori Goosenberg set up a Matt Kaplan goal late in 
the second half. Frustrations were evident as Matt Zehner was forced to 
shed blood for the cause, and yet still came back to put the Icing on the 
cake in a 4-0 victory. 

Congratulations and good luck through the rest of your season.

who is played by Elizabeth

doesn't haw depth, but thi i 
because the tory is told from 
Jake's point of view and even

only thing I don't under tand 
is why Hughes wait an hour 
and a half into the movie to 
present the off pring i ue 
sin e he could have used it to 
its full p tential, had he deli,

There are quite a few funny 
moment throughout the 
m~vie. Mo t of the humor i 
centered around Jake and his 
habit of appr a hing every

The e ordeal are related 
through vignette that often

include neighbor ob I.' ed

It' aim t like seeing two dif,

SONaR • musIc 
by jeff lambeth 

The UCSD contemporary 
music ensemble SONOR is 
probably best described as di-
verse. With a repertoire rang-
ing from standard 20th cen-
tury compositions to experi-
mental music and from solo 
pieces to full symphony 
works, they defy ca tegoriza-
ti on. 

SONOR has also caught the 
attention of numerous critics 
and music elite around the 
world with their diverse, ground-
breaking performances. Sail. 
Diegans can see the ensemble, 
comprised of UCSD profes-

. sors and graduate students, at 
Mandeville Auditorium on 
Feb. 17, at 8 pm. 

The ~how will feature sev-
eral different works . The first, 
which will be directed by pro-
gram director Thomas Nee, a 
UCSD professor of music, is 
"Shadows," written by noted 
UC Berkeley composer Rich-
ard Felciano. The work, com-
missioned by the National 
Endowment for the Arts, is a 
reflective piece for flute, cla-
rinet, violin and percussion. 

According to Nee, Felciano 
will be on hand for the per-
formance. He is one of just 
four composers commissioned 
to write works for the opening

of San Francisco's Davies Sym-
phony Hall. He has received 
grants and awards from the 
French and Italian govern-
ments, the Guggenheim, Rocke-
feJler and Ford foundations, 
and the American Academy 
of Arts and Letters. 

Nee said that the experi-
mental nature of some of the 
selections doesn't translate to 
atonal din. "All the pieces are 
fairly easy to listen to ," said 
Nee. "They can be enjoyed on 
different levels, by people 
active and removed form the 
contemporary musu: scene." 

The second piece, written 
by UCSD grad student Paul 
Koonce, is titled "Spin-curve 
foci," and utilizes flute, guitar, 
and percussion. "Two sea 
chantays" follows. The work, 
by UCSD professor Will 
Ogden, uses soprano and bari-
tone singers as weJl as per-
cussion . 

The highlight of the per-
formance, according to Nee, 
should be the "Transfigured 
Wind III," by UCSD profes-
sor Roger Reynolds. The ac-
claimed composer uses com-
puter tape and a chamber or-
chestra for the piece, which is 
a dialogue between .a flute sol-
oist and the chamber orches-
tra.

Science turns artistic 
by sabrina youmans 

Being primarily a research 
institution, UCSD can have a 
very st~rile environment. How-
ever, the university is not 
limited to research for techno-
logica l advance ments. The 
Grove Gallery's " Arts of 
Science" exhibit uses techno-
logy for its artistic beauty. The 
paintbrushes beco me al-
gorithms; the canvas is com-
puter paper, and the model is 
technology. The result is art, 
even if it is unintentional. 

All articles in the exhibit 
were produced for scientific 
research , and this is what 
makes the show unique. There 
ia a certain cleanliness to the 
functional beauty inherent in 
science. The Grove Gallery 
captures the congruence of 
knowledge and beauty by show-
ing that in today's world, what 
is technologically progressive 
can also be aesthetically pleas-
ing. 

Some of the most beautiful 
works are also the most in-
novative in scientific research. 
The "Ussisng Chamber" de-
veloped by UCSD Develop-
mental Technician Doug Tis-
dale, is the only apparatus of 
its kind that will grow a single 
layer of human cells. It is a 
montage of plexiglass cubes 
etched in blue. Also progrt!s-
sive in research and visual art 

is the work of Dr. Walter 
Munk. He is a professor at 
UCSD's Institute of Geophys-
ics and Planetary Physics who 
presenteg several pieces includ-
ing, "Amorgos Revisi ted," 
which is a photograph taken 
from the space shuttle Chal-
lenger showing portions of 
Crete and Turkey . The dt!-
tailed photo relays the texture 
and the dimensions of th e 
geography of the two land 
masses ; it also picks up two 
boat wakes in the ocean water 
separating the land. Munk also 
contributed "Random Walk ," 
the result of letting the com-
puter draw random lines with 
the only restriction being that 
the computer always stays on 

the paper . The result is a 
mechanical scribble of lines 
crossing each other in a confu-
sion of swirls. 

The technica l sculptor is 
represented by a mono-boJit!d 
black violin d es igned by 
Michael Mo nfort, the super-
intendent of the mechanical 
shops in the department of 
chemistry . The violin was 
crt!att!d for UCSD violinist 
and composer Janos Negyesy. 
There is no resonating cham-
ber to the instrument; instead 
it has an electrical pickup built 
into the bridge. 

Visual images by Mark 
Ellisman, the director of the 
Laboratory for Neurocytology

A new "Cop" out 

by phil macgovern 
hiatus in[(~rn 

The other day my friend 
and I were talking about 
movies and movie stars. One 
of the few things that we could 
all agree on was that any movie 
sta rring James W oods could 
be elevated from the quagmire 
of bad movies up into the 
realm of goodness. The new 
movie "Cop" falls into this 
category. 

While being nothing new or 
innovative in the story depart-
ment, "Cop" is able to suc-
ceed purely on the basis of 
Woods' presence. He is a 
dominant fo rce in all his 
movies, and it is no different 
here. The plot is of the stand-
ard policelacrion fare; Woods 

stars as a loner cop whose 
marriage is breaking up. He 
arrives at the scene of a brutal 
and di gusting murder. While 
seeming to be unique, this 
murder convinces him that 
there is a psycho-serial killer 
on the loose who has been kil-
ling people for the last 15 
years. 

Of course, no one in his 
department believes him . So, 
he goes out and break al most 
every law imaginable trying to 
solve the serial murders. He 
gets pulled from the force, 
falls in love with the beautiful 
poss i b Ie-vi c ti m - wi t ness 
(drably played by Lesley Ann 
Warren ) and ends it all with a 
final shoot-out with a crazed 
murderer.

The writer gets side tracked 
in the middle witl; some did-
dling arou nd with gay crookt.-d 
cops, but for the most part 
you ca n figure out the whole 
movie ill about five minutes . 

There is not really much to 
recommend abou t this movie. 
It is very average in all re-
pe ts. The action is pretty 

minimal (although it takes at 
least three hotgun blasts to 
kill the bad guys), there is not 
any real suspense or mystery , 
and even the ex scenes are 
muted. To summarize, there is 
no one featu re that stands out 
to fit this movie into anyone 
person's tastes. 

It tries to cover everything 
but ends up with o nl y a smat-
tering of nothing. The photo-
graphy and direction are like-
wise nothing spectacular. But 
there is one problem with all 
these complaints: they did no t

A Japanese musical 
by eleanor castillo 

hiaru8 writer 
A taste of the Orienr comes 

to UCSD as the Japanese 
Broadway musical "Utamaro" 
will be performed for one 
night only at Mandeville Au-
ditorium o n Friday, Feb. 12. 
"Utamaro" is about the plight 
of an 18th century woodblock 
print art ist, by which the crea-
tor centers upon the simi lar i-
ties about life in the past to 
that of p resent day. 

This production is one of 
three original musicals, created 
by renowned composer Taku 
Izumi, that form a trilogy por-
traying p resent society. It has 
been coveted for its effective 

to decline. Peasant 'revolts 
were common and the enter-
tainment district of Ryogoku 
in the city of Edo (Tokyo) be-
came home to many young 
artists. Among these was Uta-
maro. 

Meeting Okita, a waitress in 
a tea house, Uta maro finds 
fame through showing his por-
traits of her . Utamaro enjoys 
most of his time being with his 
frie nds, who spend their days 
thinking up all manner of prac-
tical jokes. Unfortunately, o ne 
of their practica l jokes causes 
a breakup between the new 
lovers. 

Times quickly change upon 
the death of Chief Sogunate 

Councillor T anuma Okitsuga. 
A dark shadow is cast by the 
Kansei Reformation , and U ta-
maro , now alone, throws him-
self into his art. Utamaro chal-
lenges the new government 
with his new paintings, and is 
later dragged o ff to jail. As 
Utamaro is dragged to prison, 
Okita is seen in the crowd fol-
lowing with great love and 
concern. 

The bold production first 
appeared in 1972 at the Im pe-
ri al Theater, and starred Ka-
buki actor Somegoro ( now 
Koshiro) Matsumoto in the 
leading ro le , and Shimpa act-
ress Yoshie Mizutani as Okita. 
Other Japanese headliners in-
cluded Machiko Kyo. Frankie 
Sakai and Yuko Hama. It was 
the final work of the late stage 
and screen scriptwriter, Kazuo 
Kikuta.

and drama, which resulted in 
its reception of the prestigious 
Kinokuniya Drama Award 
(comparable to America's 
Tony Award) and the honor-
able Culture Affairs Ministry 
Arts Festival Award in 1985 . 

The musical is under the 
direction of Toshio Fujita, 
who choose to utilize the Milan 
Teatro Piccolo style of stag-
ing, in which all the performers 
are dressed in black. The guise 
of characters is assumed by 
purring simple pieces over 
their basic black. 

The story takes place dur-
ing the final days of the 19th 
century when feudalism began

UCSD. By mirr ring the tech-

reflect the exism that is an 
issue in the sciences a well as 
on ca mpus. For instance, it is 
intere ting to note that no 

exhibits were presented by 
female artists/ scienti ts. 

The up oming show at Man-

piece not only with regard to 
the instruments used, but in 
the number of people invol-

people in his piece, Koonce 
p rforms with justthree. "We 
have a real wide sound range," 
said Nee. "We get a mixture 
of different styles and sounds

There is only one thing that 
could be responsible for this 
enjoyment and subsequent 
recommendation: the force 
and personality of James 
Woods. If you appreciate 
what one man can do for a 
movie, see "Cop." It is the 
best example around.
