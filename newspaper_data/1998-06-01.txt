today in naming thi s school has already had 
amazing impact on the university," Dynes 
sa id . ''Thi s ex traordinary generosi ty will 
allow us to su ~tai n and build quality in criti cal 
engineering programs that arc vi tal to the 
future or the region. of the state and the 
nation ." 

To honor the Jacohs for thei r va rious con-

he had only a short perio.d of 
'time to decide on Gingrich 
By Vincent Gragnani 
Staff Writer 

Fulti lIing a promise made during last week 's 
protest, Chancellor Robert Dynes met with stu -
dents, faculty and staff last Thursday in the 
Price enter Theater to di scuss his se lection of 
Speaker of the House ewt Gingrich as com-
mem.:ement sp ~aker, as well as issues of cam-
pus di vcrsity. 

Revelle Provost Tom Bond mediated the 
forum, which he said was intended "to provide 
an open forum on issues of interest to the cam-
pus." 

Dynes hegan hy discussing hi s future plans 
for UCS D. 

"1 was and am com.:erned about national and 
state rhetoric and SP- I, SP-2 and Proposition 
209," Dynes sa id. "I realize that we cannot 
have business as usual at UCSD if we are going 
to make progress towards a diverse community. 

"We need a full assessment of our diversity 
aclivitie '," he added. "We need to develop new 
initiatives if we are going to be as effective as 
we can in pursuing thi s goal." 

Dynes al so said that full -time recruiters 
have been placed in Los Angeles and San Fran-
cisco with the goal of increasing the admission 
of underrepresented students by 10 percent 
each year. 

Dynes added that he had on ly a short period 
of time to decide whether to accept Gingrich 's 
oller to speak at commencement. Dynes said he 
invited Gingrich after consulting several facul -
ty mcmbers and vice chancellors. 

"Universities cannot prosper or even func J 
tion if unpopular or unfashionable ideas are 
silenced or den ied express ion," Dynes said .

Prop. 227 Discussion Held at Cross Cultural Center 
TALK: Opponents 
Listened to recorded 
interview with Ron Unz 
By KI-Mln Sung 
Staff Writer 

Opponents of Proposi tion 227 
gathered at the ross ultural en-
ter on Wednesday to educate the 
U SO community on what they 
feel are the initiati ve'S pitfalls. 

Proposi ti on 227's supporters, 
led hy husinessman Ron Unz, 
would like 10 reform alifornia's 
bilingual-education syslem. 

The Engli sh Language in Puhlic 
Schools initiati ve, hetter known as 
"Engli sh for the Children," would 
rcquire that all puhlic school class-
es he conducted in English. Chi 1-
dren who are not Iluenl in Engli sh 
would he placed in a one-ycar, 
short -term, English-only immer-
sion program. After completing the 
program, student s would he placed 
into mainstream classes. 

The initiative would also al lo-
cate 50 million for the nex t 10 
year:, to provide English instruction 
for individuals not attending 
school. These individuals, in turn , 

would pledge to provide personal 
Engli ).h tutoring to children in the 
community after fini shing the pro-
gram. 

At the presentation, former A.S. 
Vice Pres ident Externa l ArlO 
Mansury played a tapc or an inter-
view she conducted with Unz when 
he came to campus last quarter. In 
the recording, Unz said he thinks 
bilingual education is an example 
of how special interest s can keep an 
unsuccessful government program 
alive. 

"In some ways, I Ihink bilingual 
educalion is sort of like an eXlreme 

case of governmenl programs, 
Unz said . "They ' re set up wilh Ihe 
best of intenlions, but even if Ihey 
don ' t end up worki .lg, you have all 

the~e pcople who ar; tied into these 
programs who wa'lt to keep Ihem 
and you can never gel rid of Ihem." 

Unz said bilingual education is 
only one example of wasleful gov-
ernmenl spending. 

"Like the Departmenl of Com-
merce, Department of Energy and

4 OPINION 

Federal funds should not be used 
for needle-exchange programs 
that encourage drug use and 
spread disease. Clinton's refusal 
to fund these programs was a 
step in the right direction. 
By Teddy Dokko 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

There is no question thaltoday's society has a responsibility to 
light the drug war. However. there is much debate concerning thc 
best ways the ballies can he fought. 

We put more police officers nn the street. We introduce pro-
grams to educate elementary school chiluren on how to "say no to 
drugs" and how bad drugs are for their bodies. 

On the olher hand, we want to allow people wilh speciul cir-
cumstam:es to use Ihose drugs - pcople suffering from incur-
able ailmenls are allowed to smoke marijuana. In addition, there 
are Ihose who wanl to allow drug addicts. many of them sulTcr-
ing from AIDS. access to free needles, to hopefully stem the 
spread of the deadly HIV virus. 

Late in April, the Clinton adminislration rejected a plan to usc 
federal funding for national programs that would di strihute clean 
needles. The administration should he applaudeu for its dec isiun: 
however. il did not come to it without much dehate. 

The administration considcrcd studies that showed the SllC-
cess of some needle-exchange programs. It uecided, however, not 
to overl ook evidence from Vancoll ver amI Montreal showing that 
HIV was spreading and that drug users shared needles regard -
less. 

The studies in the two Canadian cities show that two 
out of three participants in the needle-exchange pro-
grams were more likely to contract HIV th an drug 
users who did not participatc. It also found that 
more than half of the drug us..: rs in volved were 
likely to cuntinue sharing needles. 

In addition. the Vancouver study found the 
highest rates of propert y crime (llx urring within 
two hlocks of a ncedle -exchange sit e. 

Even if one compares Ihe pros and cons on 
thi s, the conclusion would still he murky at hest. 

"This would he had drug policy. had I:tw-
cnforccment pulicy and prohahly also he a had 
signal to young people." said Gen. Barry McCaf-
frey, the nation's drug CIaI'. 

Support for any type of necule-exchange rm-
gram is bad domestic policy. The United Stutes 
spends millions of dollars in the prevention of drug 
abuse, stopping drugs at the horders, r,liding culti-
vation centers and illl.:arce rating uistrihutors. 
Despite thi s. there arc sliJl those who wa nt to give 
out needles ~o that illegal dnlgs can he injec ted at 
will. 

It seems Ihal Speaker of the House ewt Gin-
grich was right when he said thaI as a country we arc 
fighting the drug war Ihe way we fought Ihe wur in 
Vietnam - wilhout a ~olid ohjecti ve. 

"" 's unseemly and lerrible. unconscionable for the 
administration for Ihe governmenl of the U.S. to say 
we' re gonna give out needles to people so th..:y can u~e 
illegal drugs," saiu William Bennell , a former secreta ry of 
educalion. "That is not Ihe way to fight the drug war or to 
reduce Ithe spread 011 AIDS."

• 
Needle-exchange programs 
prevent the spread of disease 

without increasing illegal 
drug use. So why doesn't 

the government fund 
them? 

By Nilou Mostofi 
Staff Writer 

The lirst needle-exchange program took plaee in 
Australia in the 19805. Recognizing similar problems in 

our own country, a program was designed in America to 
reduce the spread of AIDS . Unfortunately. there has been 
controversy surrounding the program with regards to fed-
eral funding and whether it really work s. 

U.S. Scnate Bill 690 would establish a .:ommunity-
based needle- and syringe-exchange program 10 be admin-
istered by the Dcpartmcnt of Environmental Health and 
Natural Resources. Three goals were set for the programs 
Ihat had to be met before they could bc exccuted. 

First, the program mu st lower the use and number of 
contaminated needles in circulation in order to reduce the 
transmission of human immunodeliciency virus (HIV), 
hepatiti s D and hepatitis C. 

Second, the prog rams must provide HIV/AIDS ri sk-
redLl ~ ti o n outreach education and referral services for hard-
to-reach injection drug use rs who are not in treatment. 

Third, th e prog rams must rcduce the spread of HIV, hepati -
ti ~ B and hepatitis C to the sexual partners of injection drug 

users and thu s reducc the transmiss ion of the di sease to other 
popUl ations. 

In additi on 10 th ese three aims, each communily-based nee-
dle-exl.:hange prog ram must provi de the Department of Environ-
men tal. Heal th and Nat ural Resources with proof of its nonprolit 
s t :l IU~ and demonstrate coordinati on with local puhlic hea lth 

depa rtments. substance abuse trea tment prog rams, community 
hea lth centers. law-enforcement agencies, pharmacies, and other 
Inca l hea lth providers 10 monitor and help their parti cipants. 

The process of exchanging needles is coniidential. Education on 
HI V, hepatitis transmission and prevcnt ive mcasures that can be taken 

is also prov ided. The progra m ass ists needle-exchange users in ohtain-
ing drug treatment services and assuring safe di sposal of needles. 

This al.: t heca mc cJTectivc nn July I. 1997 and wi ll \!x pi re June 30, 
2000.

Id use to, or mayhejust don' t want 10. see thc henefit s a program

.S. S":Cfctary of Hea lth & Human Services Donna E. Sha-
lala ~; Iiu on April 20 that , "a metic ulous scientific review has 
now proven that need le-exchangc programs can redu ce the trans-
m i~sion of Hrv and ,ave li ves without losing ground in the haltle 
against illega l drugs. It o ITer.~ cOlllmunities that dccide 10 pursue 
neculc-exchangc progra ms yet another weapon in their fight

Many phy,icians support Shalnla 's statement. Harold Varmus, 
M.D .. director Ill' the National Institutes (1 1' Health . noted Ihat, "an 
ex hausti ve review of the science in this area indi catcs that needJc-
exchange program, can be an affecti ve cOl11ponenl of the global 

effort to end the epidemic of HIV disease." 
David Satcher. the new surgeon general appointed in February, has 

hi , torically supported needle-exchange programs - ever since he was 
director of the federal Centers for Disease Conlrol and Prevention.

Monday, June I, 1998 The UCSD Guardian OPINION S 

GINGRICH IS AN ACCEPTABLE AND VALUABLE SPEAKER 
Editor: 

Professors Susan Davis and Dan 
Schiller claim that Newl Gingrich' s 
upcoming commencement address 
has nothing to do with free speech 
and everything to do with his agen-
da to cripple American education, 
hi s desire 10 foster racial animos ity 
and hi s aspirations for the presiden-
cy ("And the Dehate Goes On ." 
May 26, Guurdian ). Though mere-
ly reiterating these assertions 
seems suflicient to refutc them. an 
implicit premise of the professors' 
article merits more attention. 

The premise takes the following 
(absurd) form - Newt Gingrich 's 
politics are so extreme and immoral 
as to disqualify him as an appropri-
ate commencement speaker. What 
makes this idea even more absurd is 
thai it is espoused by faculty mem-
bers supposedly devoted to the free 
exchange of ideas. The hyperventi-
lations of UCSD leftists notwith-
standing, Newt Gingrich is not a 
fascist. He is the third-highest-rank-
ing constitutional offi cer of the 
Uniled States. His politi cs. while 
conservative, are within the main-
stream . He has provocati ve. inter-

NEEDLE: 
Federal funds can be 
spent more wisely 
Continued from page 4 
best way to fight thi s nati onal uis-
aster is to have a zero-tokrance 
poli cy. 

The auvocates of needle 
exchanges want to l:O nsider drug 
abusers <1$ victims who arc addi cts 
heca use of their environment and 
not hccause of the conscious dec i-
sion they made to start us ing the 
drugs. Advocates don' t want to say 
drug users are wrong for ahusing 
drugs. Instead of helping them to 
overw me their addicti ons, they 
simply want to give them mme 
opportunity to usc drugs. 

Spending federal money to 
help addicts quit drugs would he a 
far wiser way to spend the money 
of the hard -wo rking American 
taxpayer. A poli cy that gives ou t 
free needles so people can shoot-
up is trul y unconsc ionable. 

People argue that the needlc-
exchange progri\.1ll will he lp tn 
reduce the spread of AIDS. This is 
not smart policy. There is one sim-
ple way or stopping the AIDS epi-
demic in this w untry. Call it old-
fashioned, call it reactionary; how-
ever, this plan is guaranteed to work. 
We simply have to teach young chil-
dren not to abuse dru gs and not to 
have sex out side of marriage. 

If everyone were to follow those 
twO simple rules. AIDS would sim-
ply die out. Risky and dangerous 
contact that presents a possibility 
of transmission would not likely 
take place. This is not to say that 
we are to not have interaction with 
those unfortunate enough to have 
contracted the di sease. 

It i understandable that not 
everyone is going follow tbese two 
rules: however. the more people 
that don't inject themselves with 
illegal drugs and don 't have sex 
outside of wedlock , the beller. If 
we can educate lhe masses as to Ihe 
best way to stop the AIDS epidem-
ic, more federal monies saved on 
trealing Ihose wilh the disease 
could be spent on scientific 
research 10 hopefully lind a cure.

wide range of topics, and he will 
undouhtedly deli ver a thoughtful 
and respect ful Illessage to the dass 
of r99H. In short , he is as qualilied 
as President Clinton to give a com-
mence ment address at UCSD. 

The hea rt of the Great Gingri ch 
Dehatc of 1998 is not whethe r the 
Speaker should have heen in vit ed 
to commencement. The real issue is 
whether he shoulu ha ve bel.:n 
exc luded from consideration as 
COllll1lenCement :;peaker. (Answer: 
No.) The students and alumni of 
UCSD now face a stark choil:c -
will we let the forces of political 
correctness intimidate us and allow 
thcm to decide which views are 
appropriate for our consideration, 
or will we stand up for free speec h. 
the free exchange of ideas. and 
political hcterogeneity among com-
mencement spcakers'!

ti l: ipating in th.: CIDC prog ram 
and internin!! on Capi t;1! Hill , I 
would li ke Il~ give my opinion of 
th ~ protests going O il at our cam-
pus. I have not the n..:rve tn t<:l l any 

person they do not have a right 10 
protest. however, I question the 
henelits of this protest. Surely. 
.:ven the protesters wi II have somc-
thing to gain hy hearing the Speak-
cr of the House of Representat ivcs 
speak at commencement. If noth-
ing else. his words can he used as 
opposition research tll help solidify 
your argument s. I would be trou-
bled if any person at our fine uni-
versit y woulLi deny a person the 
right to speak hecause they did not 
agree with his or her vicws. 

III response to the writer who said 
Ihat this wali just a husiness deal to 
bring prominence to the university, I 
would agree that it is. However. I 
believe that having Ihe Speaker of 
the House and the Presidenl of lhe 
United States hack-to-hack would 
hring signilicant prominence to our 
university and would allow us to get 
even bell.:r speakers in the future. 

As a student graduating in the 
spring of 19!J9. I would love to sec 
a person like Colin Powell speak at 
my CO IIIIll.:ncelllent. However. if 
you succeed in denying the Speak-
er of the House the opportunity to 
speak at our ull iversity .. then you 

OFFICIAL NOTICE

will severely hamper Ihis universi-
ty 's ahility to get a prominent 
speakcr in the future . 

You Illay not agree with anything 
that this speaker has to say at our 
commencement. however. it is my 
belief that you can learn something 
from his speech. Do not prevent 
someone from speaking, or ruin a 
speech. just because you do not 
agree with his views on some issues.

Many republicans made stale-

the action was laken to counter "a

program that gives free needles to

However. a recent tracking of

which served as a model for the 
program mandated by 227, showed 
Ihat none were redesignaled as

ThIS means Ihat the program m:tn-
dated by Proposition 227 docs not

yc e p 
The Naked Man, the Bio Nerds, the Hygenically Challenged, 
and the Warren Writing Program - Thanks For the Memories 
By Mary Higgins Senior Staff Writer 

Summer doth approach. I've 
seen a new gleam of hope in the 
eyes of my fellow students. In just 
two weeks, school will be over and 
the class of 1998 l:an kiss UCSD 
goodbye forever. 

As a senior, J suppose it is time 
for me to reminist:e about how great 
this school is and extend my grati -
tude to the people who have helped 
me along the way. 

But, I'm not graduating. So, I 
guess I l:an just go ahead and oc 
snide, as usual. 

I' m glad this wasn ' t my last year 
here. The memories forever etl:hed 
in my mind are flunking l:hemistry, 
getting suhpoenaed, and smashing 
the cockroaches. which periodically 
infest my apartment building. 

This year wasn't all bad. Lut:ki -
Iy, I had the opportunity to vent 
about my woeful existence every 
week in this w lumn. I feel a spedal 
intimacy with those of you who 
have followed "Psycho Therapy" 
since last Ol:tober (or at least 
glanced at it hriclly before using it 
to line Murry 's litter hox ). 

I've shared some of my most 
personal moments with you - like 
the timc I was ul:l:osted by Naked 
Man at Black's Beach. Some of you 
h'lVe even responded by shari ng 
your own stories of sexual prob-
lems, truck drivers and annoy ing 

roommates. 
When people lind out I write a 

"fluff" column for the Gtlan/ian, 
their first comment is usually, 
"Wow, /' II oct you make a lot of 
money doing that !" 

No, just kidding. I've never met 
anyone that stupid. 

Actually, their Ii~t question is, 
"Wow, how did you convince tlie . 
Guardian editors to let you do it?" 

I usually gi ve them one of threo.: 
answers: (a) "The edilOrs were des-
perate," (h) "I suffered for a year as 
a news reporter and they felt sorry 
for me," or (c) "I threatened them 
with physical violence." 

Here 's the actual trulh: I whined 
obnoxiously to GUlin/ian Editor 
Terry Lew until he threw hi s hands 
up in the air und said, "Go ahead! 
What the hdl do I cure if we go out 
of husiness and the Koa/a becomes 
the onidal school newspaper?" 

So that 's why my freaki sh icon 
grins up at you every Monday 
morning. That is also why I have the 
freedom to randomly insult bio 
ncrds and to babhle for a thousand 
words ahoU! orgasms and truck dri -
vcrs. 

I honed fahliious writing skill s 
fOllr years ago in t he Warren Writ i ng 
program. That was an experience 
that I'll never forget. no mailer how 
hard I try. 

Maybe I'll never win 
the Pulitzer Prize. 
Sometimes I 
exaggerate. 
Sometimes I poke 
fun at stuff that 
other people take 
seriously, like 
nudism. This Is not 
good journalism. I 
Just hope I made 
someone laugh this 
year. I would be 
happy knowing that 
at least once, some 
depressed 
undergraduate 
finished reading my 
column and decided, 
"Dang, my life really 
Isn't so bad." 

For those of you who think War-
ren Writ ing is a poi ntless waste of 
tinll:. let lIle ex plain to you the pur-
pose of the dass. Every year adllli s-
sions o ffi cc r~ read essays from 

Music 

UCSD-hopeful s that read some-
thing like thi s: "So, I thought to 
myself, I should, like, go to UCSD 
hccause it 's, like, really close to 
Tijuana, you know'}" 

As a result, the Warren Writing 
program was developed by the 
administration with two objectives 
in mind: lirst , to teach basic writing 
s kill.~ to students who bluffed their 
way tJ:trough high school English by 
watching Mel Gihson's "Hamlet" 
r;lIher than actually reading the 
play; and second, to edU(;ate incom-
ing students ahout controversial 
issues such as sexual diversity and 
the U.S.-Mexi co horder. • 

My fel/ow freshmen and I rose to 
meet the challenge, authoring 
dozens of provocative, eloquent 
essays entitled, "Equal Right s: 
Cows are People, Tool" or "Bridg-
ing the Gap: Why l:an 't the UCSD 
and SDS U fraternities party togeth-
er?"' One time I saw a Warren Writ -
ing TA huddled on the street, rock-
ing himself hack and forth, whim-
pering, "My God, this is the down -
fall of literacy l" 

I rose from the l\nonymity of 
Warn.: n Writing to fame and glory as 
a m lumnist for The UCSD 
Gua rdian. Mayhe I make a billion 
dollars less th,1I1 Ann Landers every 
ye,lr, hu t I would like to th ink th at 
I' ve made a valuahle contrihution to 

UCSD. I tigure if people are taking 
the time to read my work, then they 
aren' t out doing really immoral 
things, like molesting farm animals 
or watching Jerry Springer. 

Maybe I'll never win the Pulitzer 
Prize. Sometimes I exaggerate. 
Sometimes I poke fun at stuff that 
other people take seriously, like 
nudism. This is not good journal-
ism. I just hope I made someone 
laugh thi s year. I would be happy 
knowing that at least onee, some 
depressed undergraduate fini shed 
reading my column and decided, 
"Dang, my life real/y isn't so had," 

In retrospect. there are some 
people who deserve my gratitude. 
I'd really like to thank the naked 
people, the bio nerds and the 
hygienica lly challenged students 
who sit next to me in leeture every 
day. If it weren' t for these people, I 
would have no one to write about. I 
also want to thank the chemistry 
dcpmtment, without which I would 
have no angst. And most of all, I 
want to thank my dear readers for 
taking the time to send me sueh ni ce 
fan mail. From now on, however, 
please, just send money. 

I look forward to seeing you all 
back here in the fall. To everyone 
who is moving on 10 bigger and bet-
ter things, I wi sh you the best of 
luck. Have a great summer, UCSD.

Does "South Park" have 
an influence on viewers? 
Interviews by Peggy Lee 
Photography by Claire Schneider 

" It's a cool , social 
commentary - same way 
"Simpsons" is, There 's a 
lot of stupid shit out there 
and it shows it through 
sarcasm. It 's a little violent 
and ridiculous sometimes." 

"It's a very amusing show, 
I don ' t think it's going to 
make someone go out and 
kill somebody. I don ' t 
think a show would be

able to do that on its own, 
unless there was something 
going on in the family 
situation . " 

Nell Cotofana 
Revelle Freshman 

"I just think that it allows 
people to let go of all the 
pressures of being PC and 
just laugh at it all ." 

Nikki Perez 
Warren Freshman 

"For people that know 
better, it 's just a humorous 
show, but I think kids take 
it the wrong way. It shows 
Ihe deg radati on of the 
Ameri can society." 

Michelle Zetoony 
Revelle Senior 

"Especially for people our 
age, we know beller than 
to let some made-up kids 
influence us. You can ' t 
blame tb e sui cide on South

That's all well and good, but with-

crazy. 

So, maybe I will take off for the 
summer. I'll turn my last three 
months of freedom into one ridicu-

visit friends in far-off states and 
hike over mountains I may never

SOUTHPARK: 
Show banned at one 
elementary school 
ContInued from .... 13 
Clooney became one of the biggest 
supporters and later recorded the 
"gIlTS" of Sparky, Stan's gay dog. 

TIle main characters of "South 
Park" provide a glimpse of elemen-
tary school life through the cyes of 
the creators. Stan and Kyle are based 
on Stone and Parker, respectively; 
Cart man is a dcranged fantasy fig-
ure; and Kenny does not speak, but 
dies violently in every episode. 

Stan, thc Icader of the pack, is a 
"B" student who's good at football 
and the first of t he boys to get a 
girlfriend. Kylc is a little Jewish 
kid with an overbearing mother -
a bit smarter and more ncurotic 
than the rest of the kids. Cartman is 
picked on by the group, but an 
essential part of it anyway. He is 
fat , bigoted and addicted to Cheesy 
Poofs. Kenny is an impoverished 
kid who only speaks in murlled 
squeaks underneath his orange 
hood. 

"South Park" is gleefully offen-
sive and, at times, silly. The show 
excels in juxtaposing (;ute and 

crude. It examines relevant issues, 
but with a little extra twist. 

In an episode entitled "Big Gay 
AI's Big Gay Boat Ride," Stan when 
he diswvers hi s dog is gay - pro-
voking merciless "Stan's dog 's a 
homo!" taunts from his friends. 

In "Wcight Gain 4000," Cart-
man cheats on an essay (;ontest and 
wins a national prize, which is to be 
prescnted to him by a (;aricature 
talk show host Kathic Lee Gifford. 
The results : Canman tries to "hulk 
up" with a substaOl:e called Weight 
Gain 4000 and the gang tries to 
stop an attempt 0 11 Gifford's lifc. 

"SouthPark" also featured 
"Cart man 's Mom [s a Dirty Slut ," 
a two-part diflhanger episode 

abou~ Cart man 's quest to lind his 
hiologi(;al father. -

For all the enthusiastic hoopla 
surrounding "South Park ," the 
show also draws its share of criti -
cism. Two weeks ago in Canton, 
Ga .. the print:ipal of the tuwn 's 
Hickory Flat Elementary School 
b;lIlncu the wearing of "South 
Park" merchandisc all school prop-
crty. [n addition, due to the hlct that 
"South Park" carrics a TV-MA rat- . 
ing. parent s who huy ncw, V-chip 
equipped tclevisions will be ablc to 
block out t he show. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Regardle .. , 
audiences of all 
ages find something 
great In "South 
Park." The show 
skewers popular 
culture; Icons such 
as Barbra Strelsand, 
David Hasselhoff 
and the 
aforementioned 
Kathie Lee Gifford 
have all become 
instant punch lines. 

The main audience for "South 
Park" is college students. hut I he 
show is also popular with children 
under 17 . who (;omprise ahout one-
Ii nh of its audien~e. 

"[t' s a show for mature audi -
en(;cs , for adult audiences. and 
we really don ' t think kids should 
be watdling it." sa id Doug Her-
zog, the president lind CEO of 
Comcdy Central, to the New York 
Tillles . 

Regardless, audienc.:s of all ages 

find something great in "South 
Park." Icons su(;h as Barbra 
Streisand, David Hassclhol'f and the 
aforementioned Kathie Lee Gilford 
have all ool.:ome instant punch lines 
on the show. Jay Lena, actress 
Natasha Henstriugc and The Cure 's 
Robert Smith have also all con-
trihuted as guest voi(;cs, anu others, 
su<.: h as Tiger Woods and Jerry Sein-
feld , have offered thei r services. 

The success of "South Park" has 
catapulted its (;realors into the 
limelight. Octoher Films will 
release "Orgazlllo," a feature- film 
porn parody written, directed and 
starring Parker and produced and 
acted by Stone. The pair is also 
writing the st:reenJllay for the pre-
quel to "Dumb and Dumber," and 
will star in "BASEketball," a sports 
parody hy David Zucker, of "Air-
plane l " famc . There are also 
rumors that a "South Park" feature 
film is in the works. 

The show 's over-the-top humor. 
adull subje<.:t matter and rebellious 
spirit speak to cel1ain audiences 
and get the point across . [n an age 
of watered-down sitcoms and con-
trived melodrama, "South Park" 
provides a hilariously shocking, yet 
endearing, look at Ii fe through the 
eyes of chi Idren.

Continued from ..... 15 

Jokes aside, I'm looking for-
ward to next year. Not only to 
being the editor in chief, but 
also to see what direction the 
new staff takes the paper. 

Criticism of campus media 
mns rampant , but, remember. 
we are all trying to do our best 
and we wekome your input. 

Also, remember that one of 
the crucial aspects to attaining 
balance in any forum is to have 
a wide base of participation. So 
if you're interested, write for us! 
If you're ticked-off, write a let-
ter to the editor! 

Most importantly, with regards 
to wllege life and life in general, I 
believe it is necessary to get 
involved. Here at the Guardian 
we're always interested in helping 
people get involved.

Six members were invited to the 
National meet, and they did quite 
well. Matt Seefeld brought home 
two All-Amcrican honors (hammer 
throw, shot put). David Spector 
(pole vault) and Courtney Gray (800 
meters) were also All-Americans. 

Swimming and Diving 
At the Championships in Sl.

The women 's team finished

Women's Tennis 
The women's tennis team is a 

squad with no seniors. Yet, this lack 
of experience did not deter the Tri-
tons from playing tough all season 
long, or hinder their postseason 
chances. 

UCSD was one of only 14 
teams that qualified for the Divi-
sion 1/1 National Championships in 
Virginia. At the Championships 
however, the Tritons were knocked 
out by an older Amhcrst College 
that had lost only one match all 
year.

The UCSD golf team made its 

annual appearance at the NCAA 
Division III National Champi-

By Guardian Sports Staff 
After all the blood, SWCai and tcars, it's linally ovc r. 
UCSD's 1997-98 athlctic campaign has come to a 

dose. It was another great season for Triton sports, one 
of the hest ever. UCSD teams won two more Nati onal 
Championship plaques (women 's soccer and women's 
volleyball ) and a slew of All-Ameri can honors. 

The Scars Cup is the award given to the top athlet-
ic programs in NCAA Divisions I, II, III and the 
NAIA. The scoring structure for Division III gives 
points based on each institution's fini sh in up to 18 
sports - nine for each men and women. Eadl Nati on-

Despite fini shing third in the CCAA Champi -
onships, the women's cross-country team is a lot beller 
than the fini sh sugges ts. Lcd by sophomore Amy 
Kilchen, who individuall y qualifi ed for Nati onals with 
a sixth place at the CCAAs, the team is yo ung and 
should rehound well from an inconsistent season in 
which it displayed fl ashes of hrilliance. 

Women's Volleyball 
It was one of thc most memorable moments in 

UCSD sport s history. In front of a home crowd of near-
ly 4,000 fa ns, the wo men's vo lleyball team bested to p-

Year-End Recap 
al Champi on receives 100 points, gO for second placc, 
etc. 

The Scars Directors' Cup is a presti gious award, 
anu despitc the fact that UCSD is easily one of the top 
Division III programs, it has never won. Going into the 
linal tabulations of spring sports. though, UCSD is 
leading in the chase to be the best. It holds a slim 440-
430 lead over the College of New Jersey. 

The following is a li st of how all of UCSD's ~port s 
fared this season. 

Men's Soccer 
It was a discouraging cnd to an otherwise encour-

aging season, Head Coach Derek Armstrong's Tritons 
were a young squ ad, and many cxpectcu that it would 
take some time for the team to ge l. However, the Tri -
tons proved their douhters wrong, time and time agai n, 
all season, and compiled an 11 -5-2 record. 

That record was good enough to host a first-round 
playoff match against Clarel11 0nt Co ll ege. The game 
was a war, and unfortunately, the Tritons cal11c out on 
the losing end, 1-0. 

Women's Soccer 
Ho- hum. Another season, another Na t ional Challl-

pionship. For the third consecuti ve season, the Tri -
ton s dominated the Di vision III landscape and 
brought the National Champi onship plaque hac k to 
La Jolla . 

When Head Coach Brian McManus' squad ddeat-
ed William Smith College (N.Y. ) 1-0 in the National 
Final in December, it cuilninaled a magical season for 
a special group of nine seni ors: Lauren Johnson, Ali -
son Hurley, Brenna Cox, Kate Larsen, Toni unez, 
Lisa Wilkinson, Jodie KnOll , Beth Freeburg and 
Mariec1a Oceguem. 

Men's Women's Polo 
The men 's water polo team had a good season. hut 

was disappointed in the end when it was upset hy UC 
Davis at the Western Water Polo Assoc iati on Tourna-
ment held at the Universit y of Redlands. 

The team prospercd in the capable hanus uf Head 
Coach Denny Harper, fini shing the season with a 13-
13 record in an open di vision, featuring some top-
notch Division I opponent s. Andioring the squad 's 
deep lineup was hole set Roma~ Kudirka. who, lil r the 
second consecuti ve ~easo n , was namcd the AA 
Division III Player of the Year hy the Unitcd State, 
Water Polo Coaches Associati on. 

Cross Country 
For the si~th tim ' in seven years. the men's cross-

country team won the C:1lifornia Colleg iate Athletic 
Association Championships. Lcd hy CAA Athlete of 
the year Ga vin Klinger and West Region Athlete of the 
Year Neal Harder, the team headed to the National 
Finals in Boston. In the cold weather, however, the Tri-
tons faltered, linishing a di st:lI1t 16th. 

ra nked Juni ata Collegc (Penn .) in the NCAA Division 
III Championship gamc to give UCSD it s seventh 
Nationaltitlc. 

/\ storybook enuing to say the least - the Tritons , 
underuogs from the onset, we re on the verge of defeat, 
hut took the match to fi ve games and won it in dra-
mati c fas hi on. They fed ofT the elec tricity of the crowd 
in RIMAC Arena to pull ofT the unbelievable eo me-
fro m-hehind victo ry. fini shing with a 27-5 record . 

Women's Basketball 
The 23-4 wo men's hasketball team had another 

memorable season - induding Head Coach Judy 
Malone notching her 300th career victory. Her ladies 
took a record-breaking 16-game winning streak to the 
second round of the playoffs, where thcy faced No. 4-
ranked St. Benedict in their Minnesota gym. The streak 
was hroken, however, when the Blaze rs surged in the 
second half to secure the 73-47 win. 

Men's Basketball 
Thuugh the men fcll short of their preseason goal of 

reaching the Di vision III NCAA Tournament , their 18-
7 record is very respectable. 

Led hy NCAA Di vision III Freshman of the Year 
Ty ler Fie lu . the Tritons linished the season averaging 
97 points per game, second in Divi sion III. 

Fencing 
Fencing is a hugc sport hack cast, and it is just not 

as popular on the lert coast. With thi s di sadvantage, 
co mhined with the fact that UCS D fences in an open-
di vision - nll:aning it must hallie with Division I 
co mpetition - one would think that UCSD would 
struggle. But thi s season, that was not the case. 

With spec tacular fini shes from three-time AII-
Ameri can epeeist Janet Wert /: and sensational fresh-
man foilist Ted Padgill , UCS D managed an outstand-
ing linish in 16th pl ace overall. 

Women's Water Polo 
The wo men's water polo team was di sappointed in 

its ques t for it s 13th straight hiu to make th e Collegiate 
National Champi onship Tournament. UCSD suffered 
at the hands of UC Davis in a tough 2- 1 loss at the 
1998 Women's Water Polo Wes tern Regionals held at 
Stanford Unive r~ity. U SD lini ~ hed with a 9-17 record. 

Men's Volleyball 
Politi cs suck. Ask the men's volleyhall squad , who, 

d 'spite being the o. 4-ranked team in Di vision III and 
ddeating La Verne in the Leoparus' lair. were denied 
an invite to the post 'cason - in favor of La Verne. 

It was simply a tough-luck scason for the Tritons, 
who linished 4-20 in easily the toughest conference in 
the nation.

H.D.R.D.E. Festi·yal Not Just For Hippies Hn~more 
Blues Traveler once again gather a diverse collection of artists for your listening pleasure 

By Jonah Freedman 
Senior Staff Writer 

In thi s summer 's impending 
absence of Lollapal ooza. the 
H.O.R.D.E. summer tour is back 
in full force for its seventh con-
secuti ve summer. Since its incep-
lion ill 1992 as the brainchild of 
Blues Traveler lead singe r/har-
monica playe r John Popper and 
manager Dave Frey, H.O.R.D.E. 
has attracted thousands nation-
wide. 

After their absence from last 
year's tour, Blues Traveler are 
back on the bus to headline 
H.O.R.D.E. Joining them on the 
main stage during their California 
dates (A ug. 27 at Irvine Meadows 
in Southern California; Aug. 28 at 
Shoreline Amphitheater and Aug. 
29 at Concord Pavilion in North-
ern California) are Ben Harper & 
The Innocent Criminals, Bare-
naked Ladies. Fastball and Alana 
Davis. 

H.O.R .D.E. will feature the 
first- and second-stage dynamic 
yet again, with four to live acts a 
night appearing on the second 
stage. Encoring laSI year's innova-
tion, there will also be a third 
stage where the bands on tour can 
make spet:ia l surpri se appearances 
- sometimes acoustic, electric, 
alone or in co llaboration. Neil 

Young played an acousti c set on 
the third stage on last summer's 
tour. 

Of course, H.O.R.D.E. will also 
have the usual array of booths and 
multicultural food stands as well. 
Concert·gocrs can visit booths for 
politi cal organizations, ve ndors, 
unique arts and crafts and other 
counter-l:ulture organi zations. 

Thi s yea r's tour also marks 
more of a return to H.O.R.D.E.'s 
original sty le, with more roots-
inlluenced acts performing. Last 
year's tour was more diverse, with 
swing act Squirrel Nut Zippers, 
oddball favorit es Primus and clas-
sic rocker Young. This would seem 
just a coincidence, however, since 
Popper once state~ he would let 
anyone join H.O.R.D.E., including 
Metallica. 

No strangers 10 the li ve sccne, 
Blues Trave ler have remained a 
touring powerhouse since the 
beginning, sometimes performing 
250 shows a year. The Princeton , 
N.J .-based band has also played for 
audiences in all 50 states, both on 
their own tours and on five sum-
mers with H.O.R.D.E. By constant-
ly being on the road, Blues Travel-
er have exposed the world to their 
blues-rock blend led by Popper's 
bellowing baritone and virtuoso 
harmonica play ing. 

"We' ve always been conscious 
that the li ve vehicle is a totally dif-
ferem mode of ex pression from 
capturing a performam:e in the 
studi o," says gu itari st Chan 
Kinchla. 

The four other main-stage acts 
are also jumping on the H.O.R.D.E. 
bus at just the right time. Ben Harp-
er & The Innocent Criminals con-
tinue to enjoy their international 
underground success with their lat -
est album, rhe Will 10 Live. Toron-
to's Barenaked Ladies, like Blues 
Traveler, have relied largely on 
their live following until recent 
years. The band appeared on VH I 's 
"Live at the Hard Rock" and Conan 
0 ' Brien's New Year's Eve show in 
1997 . Their new aibulll , SllIIJI, hits 
the shelves July I. 

Fastball. who hai l from Austin, 
Texas, are quickly gai ning notori-
ety through the widespread ai rpl ay 
of their pop-si ngle, ' 'The Way." 
Similarly, New York native Alana 
Davis has enjoyed the success of 
her popular folk-rock single, "32 
Flavors," a re-working of an Ani 
DiFranco song. 

H.O. R.D. E. has consistently 
been a force to reckon with, and 
every incarnation has brought 
dynamite acts along with it. This 
year ;, ilO different, and promises 
not to di sappoint.

Lilith Fair Is One For The Ladies 
Festival celebrating women in music makes a stop at the Del Mar Fairgrounds on June 26 

By Rachel Barg 
Staff Writer 

Once again, Ihe time has come 
for yuppie women everywhere 10 
put on their Birkenstol:ks and tank 
tops and let their armpit hair grow. 
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's time 
for the Lilith Fair. LaSI year's most 
successful summer festival, named 
after the mythical biblical feminist 
figure, returns with more of the 
women of pop music. 

The concept of the all-female 
lineup came from festival creator 
and headliner Sarah McLachlan in 
1996. She intended to change the 
way promoters thought of women 
in music. 

festival consi sts of a di verse array 
of eSlablished pop artisls , as well 
as up-and-com i ng and local artists 
showcasing thei r lalents on Ihree 
different slages. 

This year's Lililh Fair features a 
much larger rosier of headlining 
artists for various Icgs of Ihc tour. 
Appearing with McLachlan on var-
ious slages across the country arc 
Sheryl Crow, Luscious Jackson, 
Sinead O' Connor and Joan 
Osbornc. Many artists are returning 
for the fair's sophomore effort, 
including Paula Cole and Suzanne 
Vega. 

''Three years ago, promoters 
were really sl:ared to put twg 
women on the same bill ," McLach-
lan said. "Now the dimate has 
changed dramatically. We've 
proved it I:an be done." 

This year, fans won't have to 
leave San Diego in order to see 
their favorite female artists onstage 
together - McLachlan is bringing 
the Lilith Fair to the Del Mar Fair-
grounds on June 26. Joining her in 
San Diego will be Shawn Colvin, 
the Indigo Girls and R&B sensa-
tion Erykah Badu. Natalie Mer-
chanl will be performing songs off 
her second so lo album, while Badu 
will add a touch of soul to the 
moslly folk and pop inspired line-
up.

Mysterlou.: Lilith Fair creator Sarah McLachlan Will headline the second annual summer tour, which 
will be coming to the Del Mar Fairgrounds on June 26 . 

Women both young and old 
came out in record numbers to see 
their favorite female artists per-
forming together in one show. 
The artists themselves welcomed 
the opportunity to ~ollaborate 
with some of their ~ontempo­
raries. 

After the phenome~al sUl:cess 
of the tour last year, artists and cor-
porale sponsors both eagerly 
sought to aff,Iiate themselves with 
the fair. 

This year's Lililh will feature a 
talent search for 14 local bands, 
and a national on-line search for 
five bands to help spotlighl local 
artists . The feslival will reach morc 
eitics and feature more performers 
than ever before. 

Some of the Lilith Fair's cor-
porate sponsors this year indude 
Starbucks and VH- I, targeling an 
audiem:e comprised mostly of 
women in their 205 and 305 . The 

Thc Lilith Fair has a lot of 
hype to live up 10 in its sccond 
year, but the ce lebration of 
women in music promi ses to 
exceed expectations.

Last Words from Guardian Seniors ... Urena Interviews by 'ear Lee Photos by CIII" SchneIder 
What would you do during your 

ideal summer? 

"My ide,at summer is to 
move to L.A. and party 
until the sun comes up on 
Santa Monica Boulevard, 

. tbaby." 

Dan Hoang 
Warren Senior 

"I'd like to go back to the 
Philippines, because 1've 
never been there. Just go 
back home and see what 
my heritage is like." 

Raymond Laudato 
Revelle Freshman 

"If I could just relax thi s 
summer, I'd be a little 
house kiuy, because then 
my only problems would 
be how many bugs I can 
catch in a day and staying 
away from big, mean alley 
cats." 

Conor Dougherty 
Revelle Junior 

"I work at the Oakland 
Zoo so my ideal summer 
would be to be surrounded 
by animals. That's what 
I'm going to have to do 
anyways. You know, visit 
the zoos of California -
starting from San Diego 
and moving on up." 

Keney Gardner 
Marshall Sophomore 

"My ideal summer would 
be to go to Hawaii , and 
hike Monakaya, and hike 
through the seven sister 
va.I1eys in the big island ." 

Tim O'Kee'e 
Warren Senior 

Simple dreams lend themselves to tbe richest happiness 

Claire Schneider 
I have watched past photo edi-

tors exit the Guardian, never to be 
seen again . Perhaps 1 should te ll 
these photographers that [ am about 
to throw out all th ei r negati ves, 
which are silling in my ofli ce col-
lec ting dust. One by one, I will 
extricate their strips of negal i ves 
from their plastic housi ngs, send-
ing them to lom:some graves. How-
ever, 1 wi II keep all the plastil: neg-
ati ve sleeves for myse lf - I am 
sure to save a [ot of money by 
reusing them. 

The reason I need negati ve 
sleeves for myse lf is that [ wi II 
never stop shooting fi lm. Guardian 
or no Guardian, school or no 
school, photojournali sm will 
always be an essential part of my 
life. 

Photojournali sm is also the love 
of my life. It might sound strange, 

but I love it so much that I woul d 
die a happy death if [ was doing 
photojournali sm at the time. 

Fri ends who watched me make 
weekl y (sometimes daily) treks 
down to Tijuan a feared fo r my life. 
[ thought about these warnings. I 
began to be lieve in God. I never 
stopped fea ring death , but there 
was one thing I feared even more 
than dyi ng: not li ving li fe and 
reaching my goal '. 

So strong was my I:o mmitment, 
that the fin al week before the 
Guardian was going 10 publish my 
story on Mexican migrants, [ was 
up at 4:30 am every morning mak-
ing the trip down to Mexico. This 
lasted until [ fe lt I had gOllen the 
shots I needed. and left me exactly 
four hours to write my story. 

Sadly, my year as photo editor 
for the Guardiall is now over. I will 
miss it terri bly. The Guardiall pro-
vided me with my most imponam 
necessities: free film , chemi ca ls 
and a darkroom. 1 have a salary 
whi ch pays for my rent and most of 
my ex penses. 

No t onl y will [ mi ss the 
Guardiall for material reasons, I 
will mi ss thi s newspaper for all that 
it has taught me. My job has made 
me into a more patient teacher, a 
beller photographer and a ocHer 
leader. More importantly, the 
Gllardian has given me the oppor-
tunity to wo rk on stories that l l:on-
side r important to my future career 
as a photojournalist. 

The question now is what will I 
do without the cushion of the 

Gllardian support ing me every step 
of the way. WillI be able to contin-
ue pursuing photojournali sm to the 
same ex tent outside of schoo)'? As 
graduation nears, [ rack my brain 
every ni ght in various states of 
insomnia, debating my chances of 
making it in th is profession. 

I think of all the college gradu-
ates who want to do the same thing. 
I think of all the kids who arc 
forced to intern at newspapers for 
free just to get experience. 

I qui ver with fea r thinking of all 
the photographers out there pay ing 
$30,000 a year in tuition bill s for 
schools like The Brooks [nstitute in 
Santa Barbara. Many of them grad-
uate only to make minimum wage. 

Anyone who didn't know any 
bellcr would believe breaking into 
this business was impossible. Sev-
eral im port ant rea liza ti ons have 
changed my mind. 

First. I stopped li stening to the 
advice of newspaper photogra-
phers. The bunch of them arc a 
jealous and insecure 101. Secondly, 
I have dec ided not to [imit myse lf 
to shooting for newspapers bel:ause 
they are shrinking, not growing. 
Third, I have decided that I have 
another marketable ski II besides 
photography: writing. 

Perh aps [ will free lance fo r 
magazines. Or maybe 1 will work 
for a photo agency or a wire ser-
vil:e. But 1 won't pay $30,000 a 
year to get there. I know that I can 
learn many of the ski lis I need 
without ex pensive schooling.

Thursday, June 4, 1998 The UCSD Guardian SUMMER & GRADUATION SPECIAL S7 

______________________________________ ~~~~=~BGUOOA~9U~L 

Last Words from Gua dian Seniors ... 
Leaving what you love to head off into the unknown 

can sometimes be the only way to find out who you are 

Jonah Freedman 
The future. Kind of a scary 

thought if you don't know what lies 
ahead for you. Like many of my 
friends and colleagues here at 
UCSD. [ will be walking across 
that stage, adorned in a silly-[ook-
ing cap and gown. to receive my 
college diploma in a few days. It 's a 
fri ghtening thought. 

I' ve spent four long years here 
in La 10ll a working (fairly) hard, 
trying to earn my degree. When 
June 14 rolls around, it wi ll all 
come to a culmination - and ulti -
mately, an end. The question that is 
on my mind, as I am sure it is with 
many of you is. what next'? 

While I have a vague idea as to 
where [' m headed, I' m still not sure 
what will become of me. College is 
a safe and secure environment. 
Every week is predictable. You 
know exactl y what's coming up -
a midterm here, a paper there, be 
ready for that final by then. 

What comes after is not quite as 
predictable. It's the great unknown. 
This is that point where everything 
you have been working for in 17 

.. $10 PER HOUR 

years of schooling is supposed to 
come to a head; where it should all 
payoff. Of coun, if you' re plan-
ning on grad school, of course. 
you've gut a lillie more time to be a 
kid. 

I'm not looki ng at graduate 
s(; hool just yet. I'm trying to li nd 
some son of employment for a 
while, some kind that will help me 
on my way to allai ning my (;areer 
goa ls. The catch is, I'm try ing 
something that [' m sure some of 
you are auempting. ['m relocating 
and try ing to get my feet wet far 
from home. 

In September, I'm ventu ring off 
to New York City to seek my for-
tune. Maybe that's a liule Ker-
ouac/Ginsberg-ish, but 1 find the 
thrill of the big city exhilarat ing. 
You know - street-muggers, cab 
drivers with incomprehensible for-
eign accents, car horns honking 24 
hours a day, 7 million people with 
uninhibited middle fingers, roaches 
the size of Cadillacs, big scary 
mali a dudes who fit their "cus-
tomers" with concrete shoes, Mike 
Piazza and so on. 

When [' m not busy reveling in 
that, I'll oc pursuing thi s lillIe sem-
blance of a goal called journalism, 
un der the assumption that my hours 
of hlood and sweat at the Gllardian 
will payoff. [n moving to the city 
that never sleeps in hopes of gain-
ing a lillIe experience in the I:apital 
of magazine-land. 

The key isn't what you know -
iI's who you know. The mass media 
is a worl d that's all about connel:-
tions (Comm majors, can I get an 
"amen"?), and it 's a diffi cult plaee. 
It is now June, a mere three months 
away from when I'm planning to 
move, and my world right now is 
one of unknown s.

dents, I am a Californ ia kid. and 
didn't travel all that far from home 
to get here. So allY move of more 
than a thousand mi les is fairly sub-
stanti al. But the Big Apple is 3,000 
miles away ... and it 's a world of dif-
fere nce. [ don't know where I'm 
going to live. I don' t have a job yet. 
Will it all work our} It ' ll be cold. 
It ' ll be much harder to see my fam-
il y and friends. I' ll be all by myse[f, 
miles away from home. 

The bollom line is, ['m prelly 
sl:ared. But that's all part of the 
exhilaration of venturing out into 
the big world. It 's about taking ri sks 
and finding your niche through trial 
and error. I'm really excited about 
the prospects of my future, even 
though it is a big question mark and 
I don't have many of the speci fi cs 
nailed down. 

I'm moving ahead with nothing 
but faith in myself, and thaI's really 
what iI's all about. At a certain 
point , we all have to believe in our-
se lves enough to know we can SUI:-
ceed. I am confident in myself and 
[ know that everything I have 
learned and acquired in my years of 
preparation have readied me for 
whatever li es out there. 

When I walk across that stage to 
get that diploma nex t Sunday, 
Jespite my apprehension, I will be 
relie ved and excited. [ know Ihm 
what I will be holding in my hands 
is proof of my abilities anJ dri ve. 
My sk i lis have taken me t his far. 
through the four turbulent years I 
spent growi ng inlO the person I 
have occome. I'm the only one who 
can di ctate how far I'll go. 

I'm ready for New York . The 
question is, is New York ready for 
me'! Good luck to the Class uf 
1998.

A piece of advice ... from someone who

Brendan Cahill 
As I look out over this sea of 

grad uates, hopeful faces, cri sp 
black mortarboards and dreams of 
tomorrow shining in their eyes. I 
am reminded of my own gradua-
ti on, so many years ago. 

It was June 1967; the Summer 
uf Love was a glint on the hori zon, 
Jimi Hendrix was tops of the pops 
and the war raged in Vietnam. The 
then-chancellor of our fine univer-
sit y stood where I stand today, 
except he had a head fu II of acid 
and. upon I:ongratul ating each 
graduate, wou Id muller some 
addled wa rning about a "busload of 
penguins" that he was apparently 
seeing. ')'

that swe lled ...

just about any stupid thing they

At any rate, take lots of drugs

S8 SUMMER & GRADUATION SPECIAL The UCSD Guardian 

SlMEIWOOATION 5I'E<IAL --------------------------~== 

~ast Words from Guardian · Seniors ... 
A not-so-satirical view of the ups and downs 

of our graphics artist's favorite hobby 

Joe Rngiulo 
Since I've been told that I can 

write about whatever please, I've 
chosen something I feel very 
strongly about : drinking. 

Not unoerage drinking; I ~ur­
vived until I was 21 and so can 
you. This isn' t going to he some 
"safe, sane and sober" bullshit or 
a tirade about how UCSD doesn ' t 
know how to have a good time. 

That's because I'm not talking 
about having a good time; on the 
contrary, I'm going to talk about 
the issues surrounding drinking 
too much. My hobhy isn't partk-
ularly safe, il isn ' t remf>tely sane 
and, as a moral issue, sobriety is 
so irrelevant as to be silly. 

In short, I condone excessive 
alcohol consumption. 

If you drink 100 much, you 
won't have fun . You will say and 
do stupid things. Standing and 
walking will become the most dif-
ficult lasks you have ever had to 
perform. You will throw up. Even-
tually, you will wind up hungover, 
al which point you will wish you 
were dead. Or still drunk. 

All of this is relevant. Drink-
ing would be pointless if it 
lacked drawbacks (and I haven't 
even mentioned any of the long-
term medical, legal and social 
repercussions). There are few 
experiem:es which provide such 
a poetic combination of pleasure, 
pain, irresponsihilily and outright 

idiocy. 
William Blake 

said, "In order to 
know what is 
enough, one must 
learn what is too 
much" (or some-
thing like that, but 
he was a crappy 
artist so it's all 
right to misquote 
him). 

We li ve undel 
a hegemony of 
safety and effi-
ciency, wherein 

"authorities" draw on the collec-
tive and depersonalized ex peri -
em:e of the great unwashed mass-
es to tell you and me how to li ve 
our lives without the sligh test risk 
of danger or misadventure. All 
too many peorle seem to have 
"your best interests" in mind. 

Not only arc "my best inter-
.:sts" none of your business, but the 
merc knowledge that othcrs are so 
intrusive and disrespectful of the 
rights of the individual just makes 
me want to go out and do more of 
whatever it was that upset every-
one so much in the lirst place. 
Frankly, how I choose to abuse 
myself in the privacy of my own 
home (or a bar, or the back row of 
a lecture hall, or the Price Center 
bathroom) is a mailer strictly 
between myself and my liver. 

Behaving in a wholly logical 
manner and requiring a "good 
reason" for doing every lillie 
thing is a really dumb idea. It's 
also a Iiabi Iity and will harm 
your chances of successfu lly 
competing, reaching enlighten-
ment, getting laid or whatever. 

I've previously mentioned 
irresponsibility and idiocy. Allow 
me to elaborate; there is nothing 
more pitiful than a life lived 
without pointless ri sk and sense-
less indulgence. Ri sks incurred 
in the pursuit of tangible goals 
don ' t count. To properly enjoy 

Ihe philosophical rewards of 
pointless stupidity, it must truly 
be pointless. Drinking to drown 
sorrows or to feel beller about 
yourself isn't fair; in fact, it's a 
wussy cop oul. 

Drunk driving, often a con-
cern for self-righteous anu-alco-
hoi neo-Puritans, isn't really such 
a bad thing: If you're the sort of 
person who is into driving when 
too drunk to walk, I say go for it. 
Just try 10 get into that accident 
before you reproduce: you'll 
only do the gene pool a favor. Try 
to hit another drunk dri vcr, thus 
doubling the natural se lect ion. 
Also stay away from my house. 

Some people, will attempt to 
dissuade you from heing stupid 
and drinking a lot. The e people 
are not really your friends. 

Your real friends will join 
you, undermining your efforts 
on ly by stea ling your booze and 
drinking it themselves. If they 
don 't, get new friends . By not 
orinking, they have revealed that 
they have things 10 hide; most 
people who don' t drink are afraid 
to lose self-control , and you can 
bet that they have a good reason 
for doing so. 

All of these weak juslifica-
tions are beside the point; if you 
get really, really drunk, you will 
leam more aboul yourself (and 
what you look like passed out 
naked in the bathroom). You'll 
spend a lot of money, feel bad 
about yourself and other peonle 
won'l like you anymore. You 
mayor may not have fun . . 

I seem to be out of space, so 
you won'l get lO hear my opinion 
on why punk really is dead and 
the stupidity of vegetarianism. If 
you have any comments on this 
piece, contact me c/o the 
Guardian. Be sure to include 
your address, and when you ' re 
usually home. 

Now go away. You all make 
me sick .

have a degree. Lots of successful 
people (mostly foreign thieves and 
politicians) have done just fine with-
out co llege educations. If you've 
already wasled a few years here, 
then you kind of owe ilto your folks 
to Iinish up, but at least don ' t try 
very hard. 

Relationships: Three words: one 
night stand . In the words of Duran 
Duran, "Don' t say a prayer for me 
now/Sa ve it ' til the morning 
afterIWhen you' re waiting for Ihe 
bus/At 8:30 in the morning." Well , 
that 's not quite verbatim, but it's 
close enough. 

Look, no one needs these long, 
complicated, psychosexual dramas 
that we allihought we'd given up in 
high schoo l. Every once in awhile, 
you feel that need for speed, you go 
out, you find someone, you take care 
of it, you go home. Without them. 
It 's useful to rl-mcmber that people 
arc gullible and generally believe 
lies, no mailer how outrageous they 
arc. 

Work: You'll probably have to 
get a job soon because moms and 
pops arc tired of supporting your 
deadbeat ass. Work on campus. You 
spend all yo ur time here anyway. The 
jobs are mindless, and if you sc rew 
up, what are they going to do'! Fire 
you? And run the risk of having to

weaknesses as a photographer. I think 
I have found practical and inexpen-
sive ways to improve my skills. I am 
hoping to turn the coming year into 
one that will be just as productive as 
the one I have just finished. 

It is with some amusement thai I

some qualifications'! Hell no. So go 
work at La Casa, or, if that sounds 
too hard, try the Guardian. 

Television: This is your best 
friend; you have no other. It's always 
there for you, it doe n't get moody or 
hormonal , and if you have HBO, you 
can often find funny shows with 
dirty words and partial nudity. 

The Visual Arts Department: 
Just go for il and change your major. 
Lots of art majors will tell you it 's 
just as challenging as any hard sci-
ence program, but they ' re lying to 
you. II's easy as falling off a log 
(and in some of the performance 
classes, you may be required to do 
just that). 

I've been breezing through school 
for four years, I'm going to graduate 
with a VA major and no minor, and I 
just finished all of my classes yester· 
day. Finals week? I seem to remem· 
ber something like that from fresh · 
man year. .. 

But , above all, buck up little sol· 
dier. This life offer ' us some great 
opportuniti es to screw shit up for 
ourselves and others and we can' t 
not take them. That s what the col-
lege experience is about and the on ly 
reason I'll miss this sh itpit ; 'cause 
now I have to gel serious and 
become a productive member of 
society and Sluff. 

So, hey, enjoy; I'm going 10 go

Lucky Strike non-fil lers and, with 
any luck, I won' t remember finals 
week at all. See ya.

out with a ~taff of II and am left with 
two. (Not counling the loyalty of 
"Chris" and Jaime, two talented pho-
tographers who will be successful in 
areas qutside photojournalism.) 

To Dave and Lisa, lWO photogra-
phers whom I believe have done an 
amazing job this year: I leave you the 
best possible job one could ask for. 
Remember that it offers almost 
unlimiled opportunities. The best 
possible staff you can ask for is a 
motivated one. You ' ll get a lot of new 
"photographers" nexl year. Hire them 
all. It will sort itself out in the end. 

As for myself, I am going to go 
clean oul my office, and get rid of all

Tim Firth's "Neville 's fsland"

S I 0 SUMMER & GRADUATION SPECIAL The UCSD Guardian Thursday, June 4, 1998 

----------------------------------~~~Et~R*~mM 

Last Words from Guardian Seniors ... 
A mistake made four years ago is 

finally remedied in a final column 

Shahin Rahimi 
It's such a shame. 
It took me 3 years and 2 quar-

ters to get it right. Which class do 
I take? Should I vi sit my T.A. 
once in a whilc" Are lecture notes 
worth it "! Can I pass without 
showing up to class'! Is the beer at 
Poner's better than Round Table? 
If only I had known these answers 
prior to stumbli ng on the scene in 
Scptember 19Y4. Man, it seems 
like only yeslerday .. . 

Damnit , I missed tbe shuttle . I 
wonder if this North Parking shul -
lIe comes hy oft en? Prohably not. 
I' ll jusl walk 10 class. Let me sec, 
York Hall 2-something. Doesn't 
seem thaI far. And even if I show 
up to class a littlc laIC, nolhing 
interesting probably happcns on 
the first day anyway. 

What a fool I was. Choosing to 
come here wasn' t the mi stake. I 
could have made it a great experi -
ence if I had just put my bitterness 
and pessimism aside. My mistake 
was to take school too seri ously. 
My error in judgment was to 

ignore my father' s wisdom. I fal -
tered because of my pre-con-
ceived notions. 

So what if everyone says it 
sucks here . "There aren' t any par-
ties here, man! If you want. a real 
college, take the 8 to State. Now 
that' s what a college is supposed 
to be like," they kept saying. 
Classes arc too big, and school 
spirit engulfs the campus but once 
every seventh week in spring 
quarter. 

You know what though, it 's not 
about the place that you' re at, it 's 
all about what you make of it. For 
me, I spent the last four years of 
my life at a top-notch university. I 
am proud of that accomplishment. 
Where I come from, not many 
people have a chance to attend an 
institution of higher learning. I 
was born in a third-world country 
- where freedom bows to a cler-
gy hent on oppress ion and censor-
ship. That's life, though, and all I 
can do is make my family proud. 
There 's one regret that sti II eats 
away at my soul , though. . 

My parents left their homeland 
so their two sons could have a 
better life. They left their family 
and fri ends for the sake of their 
children. So how did I repay my 
parents' sac ri fices? The first time 

, I gel a chance to make a real I.:on-
trihut ion to this caMpus, J cow-
ardly enter the Guardian offil.:es 
and introduce myself to the their 
skinny sport s editor as Sean Rahi -
mi. 

Mind you, that for the last 18 
years, I was known by the old 
standby. You kn ow, the name 
you' re gi ve n at birth. In my case, 
my mother named me Shahin -

Plan for your plans to change and utilize w~at you

Jessqca Wallace 
I thought when r published my 

linal column last Thursday that it 
was my last hoorah! However, in 
light of the fal.:t that this is the 
graduation issue, graduating 
seniors were requested to I.:on-
tribute some sort of farewell to 
UCSD and the Guardian . The 
lovely-and-talented Features edi -
tors (Jess ica and Genevieve) were 
begging us to give any advice and 
stories we have about our experi -
em:es here at thi s line institution 
of higher learning, so here goes. 

The greatest lesson I' ve 
learned and therefore my parting 
advice is this: 

Make plans - and then expect 
them to change. 

When I applied to college as a 
high school junior, I applied to 
Ii ve schools. I grew up ina suburb 
of Chicago so I naturally applied 
to four schools in California and 
one in Pennsy lvani a. My first 
choice was Berkeley and my sel.:-
ond choice was Penn. I only got in 
here and San Diego State. This is 
the Ii rst ti me I learned that some-
times your plans change. 

I entered thi s sl.:hool as an 

Aerospace Engi - have, again, thankfully changed. 
neering major, 
expecting to 
impress the shit out 
of all the people I 
went to high school 
with upon gradua-
tion. I was going to 
design space shut-
tles - yeah, right. I 
no longer care 
where practically 
anybody I went to 
high school with is, 
much less do I care 
what they think of 

what I'm doing with my life. This 
wasn' t so much a change of plans 
as it was a major change in atti-
tude (and latitude for all you 
Jimmy Buffett fans). 

Needless to say, I am not about 
to become an aerospace engineer 
(or a rocket sc ienti st as my Mom 
used to fancy saying). In fact, I'm 
not about to become anything 
involving rockets or sc ience, 
thankfully. I am about to join the 
ranks of many other unemployed 
college graduates with degrees in 
art . 

If you had asked me at any 
moment in time before June 1996 
what I'd be doing when r graduat-
ed college, the answer would have 
been guaranteed to not include arl. 
Like I said, make plans, but expect 
them to change. 

If you had asked me as late as 
Jan: 15. 1998 what I'd be doing 
when I graduated in June, I'd have 
answered, "Moving to Colorado 
Springs with my boyfri end of 
four-and-<l-hal f years and gelli ng 
married shonly thereafter." 

Eegads, what the hell was I 
thinking? Nonetheless, my plans 

After I ended that part of my 
life, if you had asked me what I'd 
be doing come June, the answer 
was, "I have no idea." This is the 
only time in recent years that I can 
recall actually not having a plan. 
Not a having a plan wasn' t so bad, 
except for the fact that everyone 
kept asking me what I'd be doing 
and I hated never having a decent 
answer. Well , now I have an 
answer. 

When I graduate in June, I am 
doing nothing. I am spending my 
next year in San Diego, in the 
same apartment I've been living in 
for one-and-a-hal r years, with the 
same roommate (hi, Dora). 

There's this job that I really 
want and i I' I get it I'll be finan-
cially independent. If I don't get 
the job (i.e., my plans change) I'll 
tind another one, and Mom and 
Dad will foot the bill a lillie 
longer. 

If all goes well , in July 1999 
I'll be starting Teach for America. 
If not, perhaps I'll be starting my 
graduate degree in art (of one kind 
or another). If I get into Teach for 
America, I' ll go to grad school 
afterward. All this will hopefully 
be occurring somewhere on the 
eas tern seaboard. After that, it 's 
probably back to San Diego for 
me! 

See, thi s is my three-to-fi ve 
year plan. While this plan works 
for me now, who knows what I' ll 
want to do a year from now! I' ve 
learned that plans are always sub-
ject to change, or at least they 
should be. It is our responsibility 
to ourselves and our sanity to roll 
with the punl.:hes and let our plans

-----------______ __ .....2!SUMM~EI GRADUATION SPECIAL 

Last Words from Guardian Seniors ... 
The parting words of our resident feminst, who has represented the voice 

of the oppressed, suppressed, and undermined for the past four years 

Grace Jang 
I was told to write this column 

as a description of how the 
Guardian 's "resident femini st" 
got through four years at UCSD. 
So I sat myself down in front of 
the computer .. . and froze. 

How do you reduce four years 
of growth and development as a 
woman, a student, a minority, and 
as a person into a "feminist state-
ment"? I suppose I was expected 
to spiel about how my entire exis-
tence here at UCSD has been 
compri sed solely of experiences 
in which I have been oppressed by 
white males. 

But I am not going to do that. 
Rather, I'm going to talk about 
what this moment in time means 
for me, Grace Eunhei Jang - nOI 

as Grace Jang the 
0plll lO n co lumnist; 
not as Grace Jang, the 
Guardian' s resident 
"feminaz i"; not as 
Grace Jang, the 
nemesis of frat erni -
ti es and sororiti es, 
but as the Grace as 
thaI my fri ends and 
family know. 

I'm not sayi ng thaI 
I'm not a II the above 
mentioned things, 
because I am. My 
poi nt is that I have 

been over-essentiali zed, as people 
tend to do with any acti vist. 

I have often been told that I 
"don' t fit the stereotype" of a 
feminist. I guess people expected 
me to have reams of armpit hair 
and a "I Hate Men" sign. I have 
also been told that I am not your 
"typical Asian girl." In other 
words, I don' t like to take shit 
from other people. 

People who only know me as 
the opinion columnist are oft en 
surpri sed to see that I actually 
have a sense of humor and that, 
much to the surprise of everyone 
who reads my column , I was 
voted as the "sweetest/most sin-
cere" person in Illy graduating 
high schoo l class . 

Truth is, I'm not a stereotype. 
I'm a gradualing senior, scared 

. as shitlcss as anyone else aboul 
what's to come. Up until tOday, 
I' ve managed to convince myself 
that in no way am I like everyone 
else - I'm a non-confo rmi st; I' ve 
always been the rebel doing the 
oppos ite of what everyone else 
did. Bes ides, I got into graduate 
school, so then why should I be 
scared? 

Truth is, I don' t know. But I do 
know that I have had insomnia for 
the past four months; that, lately, 
no matter what I do, I feel unful -
fi lied; that I spend an unprece-
dented number of hours vegging; 
that , even though I got into gradu-
ate school, my life is not perfect 
- as I had assumed it would be; 
that, although I'm on the brink of 
failing my general ed courses and 
therefore faced with the threat that 
r will not be able to graduate, I am 
unjustifiably lackadaisica l. 

Truth is, I' ve never rea lly been 
ve ry good at dealing with my 
fears and insecurites . I tell my elf 
that I should be strong enough to 
deal with them - in other words, 
I convince myself that they don' t 
exist. 

I ~.:;: really going to mi ss Patty, 
the best fri end I have ever had, 
Wilh whom I have grown, cri ed, 

fo ught and J<lughed with all 
Ihroughout UCSD. Come Septc-
mcbcr, I'll be even farther away 
fro m the nest Ihat I lefl four yea rs 
ago. 

Until I lert for co llege, I had 
never been separated from my sis-
ter si nl.:e she was born a year, a 
week and an hour after.IlIC. Come 
September, I'll be even farther 
away from the siSler wilh whom I 
ha ve shared everything - from 
a ayons, baths and do lls, to hopes 
and fears relayed aaoss maralhon 
phone conversat ions. I left when 
my brother was an immalure 13-
year-o ld boy ; he's now grown to 
be a man wise beyond hi s years. 
My baby sister, who will soon be 
16, is no longer a "baby," but an 
amazingly gifted and incredibly 
strong young woman. Where. did 
all the time go? 

My mother, whom I never took 
the time to get to know as a any-
one more lhan simply a woman 
with a mill ion different hands, 
juggling a billion different things, 
will al so be even farther away. I 
don' t think I rea lly ever thanked 
Illy father. He acts as more than 
simply the stri l.: t di sc iplinarian. I 
thank my father, who still doles 
out "bedtimes" to hi s co llege-age 
daughters, for his support and 
unconditional love. 

Truth is, I' ve taken and taken 
from each of these indi viduals, 
yel I have always fell that I have 
so little to give in return . 

Truth is, .. II be moving where I 
won' t know anyone. While the 
prospec t of a new beginning is 
exciting and alluring, al the same 
time, I apprehend cold , lonely 
winter nights in which I will be 
holed up in my apanment , lyi ng 
huddled in bed, I.: rying while star-
ing at photos of loved ones under 
the waning light of a Ilickering 
candle (becau se the electricity 
will most likely be shut off, as I 
could not pay the bill on the mea-
ger income of a starving graduate 
student) . 

When some self-important 
professor tells me I'm an idiot and 
asks how a dunce like me ever got 
in to graduate school, I'll bottle 
up all the rage, tears and hurt and 
take it home - to an empty apan-
ment. Maybe I'll pour my hean 
out to the rat living in the corner 
or talk about it over dinner with 
the cockroaches. 

Truth is, I'm graduating. With 
graduation comes a new begin -
ning - and change requires 
growth. I've physically stopped 
growing at 12 but I am now suf-
fering the worst growing pains 
ever.

blockbusters. join 
us as we go ... 
June 5 

The Truman Show 
Premise: Imagine having every day of 

someone's lifc videotapcd, produ(;cd as a lcle-
vision show and watched by millions of peo-
ple. What if the show was a hit ? What if the 
subject became suspicious? The whole world 
becomcs intrigued by the life of Truman Bur-
bank in this comical feel-good movie. 

Vitals: Jim Carrcy is thc star of the Truman 
show while Ed Harri s plays the show's produc-
er. Directed by Peter Weir. 

Prediction: Thc first big feel -good movie 
of the summer looks to be vc ry, vcry good. 
Carrey has I.:c rtainly turncd himself around 
'sin(;c "The Cable Guy." 

Dirty Work 
Premise: It seems as though everyone on 

Saturday Night Live these days is entitled to 
his or her own movie. The most recent of these 
somctimes comical, sometimes horrible spin-
olrs follows the I.: haracter of Mitdl Weaver as 
he turns his down-and-out life into a revenge-
for-hire business. 

Vitals: SNL newbie Norm Macdonald and 
veteran Chcvy Chase star in thc film dircctcd 
by, of all people, Bob Saget. 

Prediction: Just another cheesy SNL goof-
ball fi lm more likely to go down as a "Half-
Baked" loser rather than a "Wayne's World" 
classic. 

A Perfect Murder 
Premise: A powerful husinessman who is 

ahout to lose every thing I.:omcs to realile that 
hi s weallhy wife (who happens to be l'heating 
on him) is more valuah le to him dead than 

alive. When she discovers that her husband has 
hired her lover to kill her, it becomes clear that 
she must ei ther murder or be murdered. 

Vitals: Michael Douglas and Gwenyth Pal-
trow play the happy couple while Viggo 
Mortensen play the lover in thi s lilm by direc-
tor Andrew Davis. 

Prediction: One of the few high-tension, 
nail -biting, adrenaline-pumping films of the 
summer and these three actors certainly aren't 
lacking for talent. Should be a good fi ght. 

June 12 
Can't Hardly Wait 

Premise: Six high school graduates are 
forced to confront thei r personal issues during 
the big graduati on party. One of the teenagers, 
Preston Meyers, struggles to confess hi s love 
for class beauty Amanda Beckett. 

Vitals: Ethan Embry and Jennifer Love 
Hewitt face the past and the future in this fi lm 
about leaving high schoo l. 

Prediction: Ju st another cheesy hi gh 
school fli ck with some cute girls and some 
doofy guys . If you loved "Cluelcss" and 
"Empire Records," lhis picture is for you. 

Six Days, Seven Nights 
Premise: When fiances Robin Monroe and 

Frank Martin decided to take their vacation 
they never expected on this much exci tement. 
When Monroe's job forces her to end the vaca-

tion and trave l to Tahiti, she reluctantly hires a 
gruff cargo-p lane captain to take her lhere. 
After being forced down by a Slorm, the two 
find themselves stranded on a deserted 
island ... and romance ensues. 

Vitals: Harrison Ford slars as the pilot 
while Anne Heche and David Schwimmer star 
as the fiances in this adventure-romance. 

Prediction: In comparison to the other films 
of the season, nothing makes thi s film stand 
out. Harrison Ford is a fantast ic actor but it wi II 
be surprising if he I.:an bring anything spectac-
ular to this project. 
June 19 

Mulan 
Premise: A yo ung Chinese woman joins 

the Chinese army in order to save her father's 
life in Disney 's 36th full-length animated fea -
ture. Her daring spirit clashes with her tradi-
tion-bound society, and Mulan disguises her-
se lf as a man in order to train as a brave and 
disciplined warrior. 

Vitals: This laleSl Disney release fea tures 
the voices of Ming-Na Wen as the title charac-
ter as well as Edd ie Murphy, Harvey Fierstein, 
Pat Mori ta and Gcorge Takei . 

Prediction: Most everything that Di 'ney 
touches turns to gold and it looks like "Mulan" 
should fare just as well. It 's also a refreshingly 
lcss-chee 'y plol choice from Disney. 

X Files: Fight the Future 

Premise: Mulder and St: ully take their 
~earch for the truth to the silver ~creen by pick-
ing up where la ~t ~ 'ason '~ final' left off. When 
a Dallas office bui ld ing is Illystcriously 
de~troyed, the two FB I agents are once again 
swept up in ;1 world of conspiracies and fal se 
appearances. 

Vitals: 
Duchovny and Gillian "'"llIt:! ." 
Files" feature 111m. 

Prediction: Secrels will be 
tions will be answered, surpri ses will 
pant. I can' t lhink of why anyone 
the "X-Fi les" television series would 
this film. The rumor is that the "Star 
Episode 1" preview will be released with 
film. 

Premise: When toy 
action figures take on thei I' 
roles and go to war in subur-
bi a, lhey become anything 
but playful. DreamWorks 
blends li ve action with cut -
ling-edge computer anima-
ti on to contend with the first breakthrough

Karen Sisco chases bank thief Jack Foley . 'n the center. lie mission is 
he breaks out of jail in order to make one 
stab at pulling off a big score. During the 
suit, Foley begins hilling on her, and pretty 
soon it's hard to tell who is chasing whom. 

Vitals: Jennifer Lopez and George CI 
star in this aetion-romance-comedy from direc-
tor Steven Soderbergh. 

Prediction: This film looks pretty similar 
to "Get Short y," however, the cast is less 
impressive. We can hope that Clooney and 
Lopez can pull thi s one off' but instincts say 
otherwise. 

Doctor Doolittle 

Premise: 20th Century Fox brings us 
another incarnation of Dr. John Dolittle, the 
mythical doctor who has the abili ty to talk to 
the animals . A s tar-~tudded cas t of vocal char-
acters drives thl.: film .

ment of the series . 

Prediction: If' you like the first three,

of the same antics and suspen 'e that we've 
come to expect over thc team over the years .

Premise: From the makers of "Dumb and 

Dumber" comes a comedy ahout a man who

himself, the two batt le for her affections. 

Vitals: Cameron Dial., Mall Dillon, Ben 
Sliller and Chris Elliott star in this 10 py

Prediction: The Farrelly brothers did a 

wonderful job wi th 
"Dumb and Dumbcr" a 
few years ago, so one 
can only expect this 
film lo fare as well. 

July 17 
The Mask 
of Zorro 
Premlae: Twenty 

years have passed

dit with a troubl ed 

past, and transforms him into the fearless 
sword fight er he once was. 

Vitals: Mart in Campbell directs Antonio 
Banderas and Anthony Hopkins in this mod-
ern Zorro adventure. 

Prediction: The fear with this film is lhat il 
may lack plot-line powerful enough to support 
Ihe mindless swashbuckling action sequences . 

July 24 
Jane AusLen's Mafia 

Premise: Fo llowing in the tradition of 
"Airplanc!," "The Naked Gun" and "Hot 
Shots! ," director Jim Ahrahams takes orga-
niled crime lo a new level of funny. Strong 
family loyalty, the strugg le for power and 
relentl ess treachery form the background of 
th is parody. 

Vitals: Jay Mohr, Lloyd Bridges, Olympia 
Dukakis and Christ ina Applega te star in the 
film from comedy director Jim Abrahams. 

Prediction: The trailer for thi s lilm was 
hys terica l, and even if you don ' t like the 
"Naked Gun" series, you' ll love thi s film.

Premise: Three brothers die during World 

War II. Their mother has just been inf'ormed of

The Ii 1111 is directed by Steven Spielberg. 

Prediction: There's no lack of talent in 
either the actors or the direc tor. All of them 
arc ta lented and at high point s in their careers. 
The film should be a fantastic drama. 

July 31 
BASEketball 

Premise: The creators of "South Park" star

SI4 SUMMER & GRADUATION SPECIAL The UCSD Guardian Thursday, June 4, 1998 

_________________ ----.:...---...:SUMM=EltRADUATION SPKIAL 

Last Words from Guardian Seniors ... 
Fufillment comes from more then acquiring power. 
Those who know see the potential in helping others 

Expectations of an ':Animal House" 
atmosphere are exceeded at UCSD 

Terrq Lew 
When I first agreed to write 

this piece, J assumed that I'd 
cranK something out in an hour or 
so. I wasn't sure what I'd write, 
but I figured that something 
would work itself out. That's all 
fine and dandy in theory. but I've 
been staring at a blank screen for 
the last few hours, it 's half past 
four in the morning and I'm sup-

po~d to be at work in three hours. 
The fact that I haven't had a good 
night's sleep since last week isn't 
helping. 

The more I think about it. the 
more I realize that the problem 
isn' t a lack. of anything to wrile 

about - instead, it 's the exact 
opposi te. How do you condense 
four years of living and learning 
into a thousand words? 

For all its ups and downs, 
UCSD is one of the best things to 
ever happen to me. Back in high 
school, I didn 't have a clue what I 
wanted to do with my life. High 
school was high school, and that's 
pretty much all there is to say 
about it. 

Senior year rolled around soon 
enough. and it was time to mail in 
college applications. A friend of 
mine came down to UCSD the year 
before, and she kept e-mailing me 
time and time again to tell me that 
UCSD was a wonderful place. 

Still not having any real idea 
what I wanted to do with my life, 
I sent applications off to three 
schools - UCSD, UC Davis (for 
reasons that escape me now) and 
UCLA (again, for reasons that 
escape me). 

I was accepted to all three, but 
I knew from the very beginning 
that UCSD was where I belonged. 

My freshman year was ... inter-
esting. I decided that one quarter 
of calculus was more than enough 
for me after pulling off a C- by the 
skin of my teeth. I ended the year 
with a GPA almost bad enough to 
get me on the dean's olbcr list. 

Academics notwithstandi ng. I 
"fractured" the occasional law 
(although nothing too serious). 
and I managed to single-handedly 
destroy a relationship with some-
one who deserved a 101 better -
something I still feel badly about 
to this day. 

Of course. freshman year was-
n't all agony. ) made some great 
.friends, many of whom I still 
spend time with today. I also start-
ed working al the Guardian -
someth!n:; that, for beller or 
worse, has played the greatesl role 
in rllaking me who I am today. 

Over time, I developed what 
could almost be characterized as a 
symbiotic relationship with the 
Guardian. I started out simply 
enough, as just another news 
wriler, but) soon began taking on 
more and more responsibilities. I 
was appointed associate news edi-
tor for my sophomore year. and I 
began to learn more about UC5D 
and what makes it tick. 

As time went by, I was promot-
ed to news editor and from there 
to editor in chief. Sadly enough, I 
became more and more consumed 
by the newspaper. The Guardian 
was becoming my life, to the 
detriment of everything else, and I 
wasn't even realizing it. 

See TERRY, Page 16 

Hevin McLaughlin 
"I'm done' Finissimo'" 
) feel like yelling it to everyone. 

I'm so pleased to be graduating. 
) mean my freshman year it was 

bad. I was betting against myself to 
survive academic probation and 
finish my career with a GPA above 
a 2.5. Now, well, al least) can say) 
would've lost that bet. 

So you're wondering, how did 
this gangly teenager from San 
Anselmo, CA (i t's in the nonh Bay 
Area, look it up, it 's the bomb) 
become the suavecito senior you 
see pictured above'? Well , read on 
in this little retrospective. I'll make 
it as quick and painless as possible 

to read, because I know most of 
you aren'l graduating and could 
care less aboul all this senior sob 
stuff. 

What does UCSD do to kids'? 
How am I different today'? It went 
so fast. Four years, all a blur. 100 
di Fferent nights and 100 different 
faces all lumped together. 

) remember this place was a"-
consuming when I was dropped in 
here from NorCal to fend for 
myself and figure out where I was 
going. It was so big. Everything 
was new; it was like some twisted 
summer camp/school combination 
on a massive scale, except you did-
n't even have to go to class if you 
didn't want to (and for a while) 
didn't) . Plus it felt like it was sup-
posed to be so much more because 
it was COLLEGE, and hey, I'd 
seen Animal House. I'd been to a 
few universities; ) thought I knew 
whal to expect. 

So I made myself at home and 
quickly this sprawling campus 
became my playground. As a friend 
in a communications class said ear-
lier this year, the school seems to 
get smaller and smaller as you age. 
Now it 's almost constricting. Every 
year that I've been in this strange 
anomaly of an experience called 
UC5D my perspectives have

widened and the world around 
me has shrunk a little. 

I've got to say its been won-
derful 10 see so many people of 
different nationalities and ethnic-
ities here every day. Those of you 
From big cities might take this 
diversity For granted, but if you 
travel east across America, you 
see that it can be a frighteningly 
homogeneous place. It really 
taught me a lot to be around peo-
ple distinct from myself. 

J mean, as much as I honed my 
skills in my classes, J learned so 
much more that both directly 
involved and genuinely interested 
me outside of class. Much of the 
value of UCSD was all the people 
it brought me together with. 

Another thing UCSD showed 
me was my size in the world. J 
was nobody in my mind when I 
came here, just another of the 
frustrated youth. Now I'm a 
unique individual, regardless of 

any groups I'm associated with. 
I know writing for the 

Guardian is no big deal, being 
Co-Associate Sports Editor isn't 
much, but I feel like I can be as 
big as I want to in this life. Not 
that I need my name in lights, but 
that I can achieve whatever it is 
that I want. Now, as Bono said, I 
just need to find what it is that 
I'm looking for. My dreams tend 
to change every week, but I think 
I'm beginning to put it together. 

Of course, delusions of 
grandeur aside, this school can 
also make you feel as sma" as an 
ant. It was very humbling com-
ing here from a high school of 
delinquents 10 learn that there are 
a 101 of people just as sharp as 
me, and some of them are actual-
ly willing to work hard. 

And you realize how sma" 
you are to the administration. To 
nearly a" the people ·who work 
here you're just another nine-
digit number to process. You 
learn all about battling the Man 
in these stifling campus beauroc-
racies. 

Just the other day) was talk-
ing with a couple of my spons 

. . 

section chums, and I think Coach 
said, "Anything that you 
absolutely have to do for them, 
like pick a major or something, 
it's easy - just fill out one form 
and you're set. But if you want to 
change or petition somelhing, 
anything out of the ordinary, it's 
such a pain in the ass you just 
eventually give up - and then 
they got you." Or something to 
that effect. We", they may have 
gOI me too, but that's why next 
weekend wi" be bliss, for) wi" 
ha ve escaped. 

So maybe I'll go into journal-
ism in the future, I don't honest-
ly know. Real journalism hope-
fully. not these hatchet-job num-
bers I've been perpetrating lor 
two-plus years here. I'll probably 
be in the Peace Corps the next 
two years, which may be he" . but 
seriously, I did manage to work 
here for two years . Two long 
years at the Guardian, four lung 
years on campus, with adven-
tures my kids won't believe if J 
tell them. 

But today J feel it went so 
fast. I look back and a" ) can see 
is a blur.

Besides, I don' t want to stress about

Life is about balance and it is 

good to make your own destiny, bUI 
you can't control everything and 
sometimes things happen that you 
don' t expect, both good and bad. 

Don't know what I'm talking 
about? Haven't you ever gone to a 
movie and it was sold out, but you 
really got a kick out of the only one 
that wasn't? Haven't you ever got-
ten an unexpected phone call from 
an old friend and canceled your 
prior engagement? Haven't you 
ever discovered you can't do some-
thing you had your heart set on and 
accidentally found something else 
that makes you even happier'! 
Haven ' t you ever fallen in love at 
less-than-the-best time but realized 
it was worth a" that you learned 
from the experience anyway'! 

Get my point'! Sometimes 
things happen the way they're sup-
posed to and while you really want 
to stick to your plan, your lirst plan 
may not be the best plan. Maybe 
somebody else can tell you what is 
the besl plan. Maybe no plan is the 
best plan. You ' ll never know unless 
you're willing to change your 
plans! Goodbye and good luck -
life's hard to figure out, bUI il 's 
worth all the effort.

TERRY: 
Public service 
provided an outlet 
ContInued frOlll ..... 14 

At some point this fall - and I 
can't figure out when it was -
everything became I.:rystal-clear to 
me: I was working my ass off, but I 
wasn ' l enjoying it one bit. I had the 
sudden rea lization Ihal reponing, 
while something I could do reason-
ably well , was nOI whal I wanted 10 
do wi th the rest of my life. 

I was vo lunteering with an 
AIDS organizal ion and I had taken 
several classes on various aspects 
of Ihe U.S. healthcare system. That 
bal.:kground, plus a couple of 
chance conve rsalions, make me 
realize that public health, and Ihe 
larger arena of public se rvice, was 
what I wanted to do with my life . 

I knew some people involved 
with UCSD Healthcare through the 
newspaper, so I gave one of them a 
call. He referred me to a big muck-
a-muck at the county health depart-
ment, and the rest is history. I'm 
working harder than I ever have in 

my life, and sleep is something I do 
on alternate Wednesdays between 
three and four in the morning, but 
I'm really enjoying myself. 

As my college career draws to a 
close, I'm staning to reacquaint 
myself with the things I had to give 
up during my time at the Guardian 
- not because of conniets of inter-
eSI or anYlhing like that , but 
because of simple time constraints. 
The other day I saw a sunset for Ihe 
first lime in a long time, and I'm 
trying to spend more time wi th my 
friends before we all graduate and 
go our separate ways. 

I neyer realized it al the time, 
but I'm starting to grasp just how 
much I gave up to work for the 
Guardian. I gave the paper four 
years of my li fe , my heart and my 
soul , and I'm ready 10 move on. 

I was married to my job, you 
could even say - for beller or 
worse, richer or poorer, in sickness 
and in hea lth, in good times and in 
bad, I was there for the Guardian 
and the Guardian was - mostly -
there for me. We tried, but it just 
didn't work out. 

Do I regret my time at the news-

Thursday, June 4, 1998 

p'aper? Not at all: The last four 
years have been an incredible 
learning experience, both personal-
ly and professionally. 

Taking charge of an entire 
newspaper with essentially no 
management experience was prob-
ably not the smartest thing I've 
ever done, but I did the best I cou Id. 
Sure, I screwed things up fro m time 
to time, but at least I tried. 

[' m looking forward to having 
my weekends free for the first time 
in three years, and I'm looking for-
ward to working from 8 a, m. to 5 
p.m. and not 8 a.ln . to 5 a.m. I wish 
next year's staff the best of luck, and 
I trust they' ll be tine. With Walt 
Dickinson at the helm, how could 
they not? 

r will walk up, shake the Muir 
provost's hand and walk away a 
free man in a lillie more than a 
week. I'd like to thank everyone 
who's ever had a smile or a kind 
word for me, even the total 
strangers, because the lillie things 
like that ani what make all the dif-
ference in the world. For those who 
want to, I can be reached via e-mail
