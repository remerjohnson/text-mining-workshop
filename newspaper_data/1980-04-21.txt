Theatre Contract Awarded, 
Scheduled to Begin in May 

An Es c ondido -based 
consbuction firm has been 
awarded the contract to build 
UCSD's first major performing 
arts theatre, and construction 
will begin in early May, a 
campus architect says. 

The $2.5 billion contract 
was awarded last week to 
Louetto Construction Co. of 
Escondido, which was the 

.lowest bidder among seven 
firms , according to Robert 
Thorburn, UCSD architect. 

Groundbreaking for the 
theatre, to be located on 
university land near the 
northeast comer of Ui Jolla 
Village Drive and Torrey 
Pines Road, is planned for 
next month. 

The 500-seat theatre, 

which should be completed in 
18 months, is based on the 
plans of Tucker Sadler & 
Associates architects of San 
Diego. 

The theatre will be funded 
~ a $3 million grant from the 
Theatre and Arts Foundation 
of San Diego, with "no money 
coming from the university," 
Chancellor William McElroy 
said . 

Pfaff Explains Alternative 
Theories of Afghan Threat 

BY DOROTHY HOUSTON 
Senior Staff Writer 

"Unhappily for us we 
seem to find ourselves in 
what seems to be a second 
Cold War, " foreign 
correspondent William 
Pfaff said here Thursday, 
outlining two interpreta-
tions of the Soviet invasion 
of Afghanistan. 

During his discussion on 
"American Foreign Po~cy 
and the New Cold War" 
Pfaff, the current Regents' 
Lecturer, coined the terms 
"minimal" or "conserva-
tive," and "maximal", for 
the alternative interpreta-
tions. 

The maximal interpreta-
tion of Soviet behavior. 

Pfaff said , "affirms that the 
USSR has launched a 
crucial strategic offensive, 
hence to make a decisive 
change in the world balance 
of power." 

Since the 50s and 60s 
the Soviet Union has 
developed the means of 
"projecting itself, and it had 
done so in a period of 
relative decline of US 
military power and low 
political confidence, or so 
the argument goes," Pfaff 
siad . "It' s a plausible 
argument...but it may 
explain too much too 

sim~ly," he added. 
The minimal interpreta-

tion, Pfaff explained, holds 
that Soviet aims concerninR 

, 

Afghanistan are ~mited to 
Soviet control of Afghani-
stan. Under this interpreta-
tion, Pfaff said, the "overall 
direction and weight of 
Soviet policy remains 
largely unchanged." 

The International Heral 
Tribune and New Yorker 
writer said his own 
inclinations lead him to feel 
the conservative interpreta-
tion is true. 

Pfaff will speak on "Iran, 
Islam, and the Politics of 
Hysteria" at 8 pm tonight in 
USB 2622. Wedneaday 
Pfaff wiU deliver a talk 
entitled "A Post-Modern 
Politics: Romanticism, 
Violence, Aesthetics" at the 
same time and place.

says candidate Linda Sabo. 

Heading the "Student Int~rests Not

campaigning by telling people she and 
her compatriots will serve a broad balie 
of students, and by stressing her 
connections with the current AS. 

"There are tho~ students who feel 
putting on TGIF s is the best thing the

that the AS gets out of the Student

One such purpose is to attract

New' Chancellor 
Brings Prestige 
But Will He Keep Channels Open? 

By Sven Serrano 
Listening to chancellor.designate Richard Atkinson speak 

at his news conference over a week ago, one could sense that 
here WAI a real national figure in the full sense of the word. 

SlIen Serrano is a contributor to the new indicator and the 
Daily Guardian. 

Atkinson spoke authoritatively on natio~aI trends .in r~ea~h 
and development, revealing much of hiS world V1e~ In ~n~f 
flAlhes. He is correct when he says that America IS In 
competition with the reat of the world to stay number one in 
industry and technology. Several times Atkinson referred to 
this struggle when he ~efended tJ.t~ resear~h ~or.k done .at 
univeraities for corporations. Supnsmgly thiS prlonty conflict 
was overlooked by other interviewers at the conference, who 
were concerned only with local affairs. 

Dr. Atkinson i. currently undergoing a tranafonnation 
Irom National Science Foundation to UCSD Chancellor. We 
will not know what kind of chancellor he will turn out to ~ 
until hia metamorphoai. is complete in September. In the 
meantime there may be awkward moments as he learns the 
provincial language of the professors and lower 
administrators, but only a few. Our new chancellor knows 
UCSD and its place in world science and academics, so he is 
not afraid to brag about it like he did during the newa 
conference. ' 

A. chancellor hi. job will be different. However, elements 
01 hi. administration are already in formation, such as the 
phAling out 01 the dual authority of the Vice ~hanc~llor of 
Student Affairs office over tenure and grants. It IS poSSible we 
may lee a "new deal" in many respect. from Atkinson, but ill 
duration cannot be foretold at thi'l0int. 

In the meantime Atkinson .till ha major dutiea before him. 
The NSF budget will affect thousan~51 of ~cientis~ across 
America and Jefine the nature of their work In precise dollar 
and cent allocations. Atkinson's job here wiU be to protect 
acience projeclll from the effects of the current recession. In 
addition his .tudy now being 
prepared for President Carter 
on technology, research, and 
national education will .et 
policy goala for the 
administration through the 
first years of the SOS no 
matter who is elected 
President fhis year. 

Dr. Atkinson will keep in 
touch with his old foundation 
friends because his poaition 
auarantees it. Like any elite 
group in a modern liberal· 
democratic society, an "old· 
boy" network exi.1I in the 
high technical and academic 
circlea. Thi. network of 
industrialists, engineer., and 
·federal contractors will call 
Dr. Atkinson back for 
consultation. from lime to Richard Atk· 
time. Hi. rank maintains this mlDn 
privilege. The key projeClII, 10 necellary for many 
departmenll, wiD continue to be aw.ded .by the grants 
commissions. They know that UCSD ~ be In good ha.nc!-. 

With the arrival of Atkinson UCSD enters a new stage III III 
15 year hi.tory, a stage foreseen long ago by ill founder •. 
Prestige, an important mgredient for all ~titution., lrav~s 
with famous narnel. Even though Dr. Atkinson knows he In 
entering a potiticized environment he.re at U~SD he will .seek 
to remain above it. After all, there I. practically a national 
.tandard of excellence to be protected he~. 0nIr the style of 
his public appearances and the lofty quality 01 his words and 
appeals Will make the difference between an Atkinso~ and.a 
McfJroy. 'The duration of the current honeymoon perIOd WlU

Hostages' Families 
Can't Enter Embassy 

Militanll holding Ameri· 
cans at the l)S Embassy in 
Tehran said yeaterday they 
would not allow hostage 

families to see their captive 
relatives, and Iran maneuver· 
ed in its diplomatic and 
economic war with the United 
States . 

Iranian officials faced 
increased friction from 
domestic forces as well, as 
unrest continued on major 
university campuses and 70 
people were reported killed in 
three days of clashes in 
rebellious Kurdistan. 

A spokesman for the 
embassy militanll; .aid they 
had decided not to allow 
hostage famities to visit the 
embassy, but might reconsider 
that decision if Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini asked. 

Iranian Foreign Minister 
Sadegh Ghotzbadeh told a 
Tehran news conference that 
Khomeini favored visill; by the 
hostagea "immediate families" 

but did not say whether the 
revolutionary leader planned 
to force the issue. 

The militants barred visill 
the day after Barbara Timm of 
Oak Creek, WI, arrived in the 
Iranian capital hoping to see 
her hostage IOn Kenneth 
Hermening, 20, a Marine 
sergeant. 

In Tehran, Iranian 
President Abolhassan Bani· 
Sadr appealed for law and 
order at universities on 
Sunday, the day after the 
ruling Revolutionary Council 
ordered most campuses closed 
in an attempt to end two days 
of clashes between militant 
Moslems and leftist students.

ADDRESS 

Monda)', April 21, 1980 

adjacent to campuses (ie, downtown 
San Francisco) and the channeling of 
research dollars into financing 
education are two unique and ideas 
Saba supports on the Jarvis II issue. 

Sabo has been the victim of 
accusations luch as "She's too 
competitive," and "Once she makes up 
her mind on an issue, she 's 
implacable," hurled with regularity at 
her by opposing candidates. 

"I'm a naturally competitive 
person," Sabo res~n,dl, "I'm g~al 
oriented and committed to followmg 
through on things once I've begun 
worlcing. If I don't win this election, it', 
not life or death. I could have a 

~nonal life or even go to the beach. 
But if we have a silly student or a 
politically naive president in there, a lot 
of students could really suffer." 

Shanahan says her primary 
motivation in running for AS president 
ties in her "desire to initiate the change I 
see necessary in the AS. I'm not 
resume shopping. I'll probably never 
end up in politics. But after a year on 
the Council I've observed a distinct fifth 
college entity that just seems to 
represent the constituencies in the 
Student Center. I want to create a 
better AS-college communications 
network so we don't have 10 separate 
people deciding where $300,000 is 
spent."

8 Game Offensive Drought Ends Saturday, 8-6, 7-5 

Triton Nine Parties At Last 
BY TIM LIOlT A 

Sports Editor 
In recent weeks, when the 

UCSD baseball team took the 
field, the results have been 
disastrous. While compiling 
an eight game losing streak, 
every game has been a test of 
their char acter. 

Last Saturday, however , it 
was different. In fact, it was a 
regular party. 

The festivities included nine 
UCSD exua·base hits, two 
fine pitching performances 
and a sweep of a doubleheader 
from Cal Baptist, 8·6 and 7-5. 

Cal Baptist had to be 
their heads at afternoon's enl 
They had to be expecting an 
easy afternoon. Though they 
had only three league wins, 
they had defeated a suong 
Azusa Pacific team which had 
drubbed the Tritons earlier this 
season. 

The UCSD offensive 
centered itself around the long 
ball. Three home runs , three 
triples and three doubles. 

The highli. ;ht of the entire 

UCSD season came in the fifth 
inning when they unleashed a 
.season's worth of frustration 
Baptist pitcher Mike Bass. 

Tony Hicklin led off the 
inning. After working the 
count to three balls, one strike, 
he drilled the next pilch over 

The Daily- Guardian 

Sports 
the left fence for his fourth 
home run of the season, setting 
a new UCSD record. 

The Triton bench emptied, 
meeting Hicklin up the third 
baseline for a series of "high 
fives. " 

The hoots and hollers 
continued as Brian Kummer 
was hit by a pitch . Then Jim 
Moffatt send one sailing over 
the left field wall, his first home 
run of the year. Moffatt circled 
the bases with a smiling and 
clapping UCSD bench again 
emptying to meet their

slugger. 
The drama continued as 

Monti Parrino stepped up to 
bat . The UCSD bench was 
ecstatic, razzing the Baptist 
pitcher and enjoying their lead. 
Parrino lifted a long fly ball 
over the left fielder's head. The 
bench did everything possible 
to root the ball over the wall 
but the drive hit the bottom of 
the chain linked fence and 
Parrino cruised into second 
with a stand· up double. 

Dean Scarafoni gave Cal 
Baptitit a hitting clinic of his 
own as he ripped a single and 
three triples, knocking in five 
runs, Tony Hicklin had a 
double and added his fifth 
home run in the second game. 
Brian Kummer had the ninth 
Triton extra·base hit with a 
third inning triple in the second 
game. 

The doubleheader also saw 
two UCSD seniors, Tom 
Nicholson and Tom Schwartz 
pitch great in what may be 
their finaJ appearances in 
Triton uniforms. Nicholson 

Cuordian p/t% b" We. CoocIwin 
UCSD third baaeman Pat McGovern added two hits Satwday. 
pitched eight innings, allowing 
six runs, only three were 
earned, as he got his third win 
of the year. 

Schwartz gave up five runs 
in eight innings of work and 
only three of those were 
earned runs. For Schwartz, it 
was his second win, as he tied 
up the Cal Baptist hitters with 
a combination of speeds and 

deliveries. 

The UCSD baseball season 
enters its last week as the 
Tritons square off against San 
Diego State this Tuesday night 
and against USD on Thursday 
for the regular season finale. 
The Tritons wiD play an 
alumni team next Saturday to 
wind up the season.

Monday, April 21, 1980 The Daily Guardian 9 

Commentary/Ted Burke 

You Can't Judge A Book By Its Author 
Some people I know 

slapped their faces 'til rosy red 
when they 'd heard that 
Norman Mailer had copped 
his second Pulitzer Prize for 
his sprawling narrative on 
Gary Gilmore, The Executio-
ner's Song. 

, Night. That was at least fun 
reading. But a second Pulitzer 
for The Executioner's Song? 
Gimmee a break. I started to 
read the Playboy excerpt, but 
man, it was dull , flat, 
colorless. " 

One guy, a habitual cynic 
whose idea of good writing 
was a quality unattainable by 
anyone still breathing, was 
particularly piqued. Over a 
beer at Walk's. he launched 

The Daily- Guardian 

Arts 

"You didn't read the book?" 
"No," he said, some pride 

coming into his voice. 
" I wasn't interested in 

Mailer," he said. "The crowd I 
hang out with has him on their 
literary shit list ... " With that 
phrase, I knew that he was 
leading me into a blind alley 
where I've been before. 

" ... I mean, a lover I used 
to be with was in a women's 
consciousness-raising group, 
and of their studies was to 

critique the a ttitudes of male 
writers toward women, and to 
realize how these male writers 
reinforce the codifications and 
moral superstructures that 
oppress women - " 

Suddenly his voice took on 
the colorless sound of an old 
New York socialist and his 
words had the allure of the 
standard fringe.group 
pamphlet. 
"- and her studies revealed 

the ways that writers, like 
D.H. Lawrence, Henry Miller 
and Mailer, all use the 
sanctuary of art to project their 
basest male fantasies. She 
gave me a copy of Sexual 
Politics to read. You ever read 
that?" 

" Yeah " I said, feeling 
slightly belligerant by r.ow, 
"did you ever read Prisioner of 
Sex?" As though I didn 't know 
the answer. 

"No" he said, "who wrote 
it?" 

"Mailer. It's his response to 
the feminist criticism. Mailer 
does a good job at _ " 

"I'd expect that from him," 
he said, dismissing me with his 
hand. "/t's in his nature to be 
on the defensive ... " 

By now, I was at the end of 
my proverbial tether. "How 
can you expect anything from 
Mailer if you haven't read 
him? At the end of Pri sioner of-
Sex, .he concedes ' the 
legitimacy of Women's Lib. 

Predictably, the conversa-
tion was becoming less than 
congenial. We both stared at 
each for long seconds and 
finally bade one another 
strained goodbyes, as if we 
both sensed that another beer 
would wash away the last 
brace from the rotting 
barricade of restraint, and 
would change what had begun 
as a friendly chat into a fist-
first anything goes. 

We saw each other at 
Walk's the next day and had 
no more communication 
between us that nodded

Strom, "and I propose that a

students and administration, Atkinson 
in particular, be set up." 

Strom also assert. that "college

aelively. and playa larger role in the 
AS." He would like to see "college 
governments change from merely a 
programming unit on the college level 
and become important contributors to 
the AS." 

"Minority enrollment at UCSD, and 
Third College especially" and "a better 
understanding between the AS and the 
Student Center Board to avoid 
conflicts" are two more " tasks tha t 
must be dealt with," says Strom. 

Along with most other UC students, 
Strom sees Proposition · 9 as Ii a real 
disaster if it passes." He stresses the 

year and came in second to winner 
Carlos Montalvo with 25 percent of the 
vote. He attributes hi. loss to the poor 
voter turn-out. 

"Three-fourth. of the ·students didn't 
vote laat year and most of them, I feel, 
are quite silly. SiUy students had 
difficulty finding the election booths. 
They were also very confused as to 
which candidates were actually silly." 
Charlton hopes that changing the 
name of his slate to the Very Silly 
Students, will eliminate this confusion.

Is Charlton really serious about his 
"siUy" candidacy? He does say that if 
elected he will "promise to attract some 
serious people into the AS. We'l let 
them work on the serious stuff." 

But he also promises, "If I win, I will

Ree Center Referendum 

In April , 1980, undergraduate and graduate students at 
UCSD will be asked to vote on a student referendum to 
construct, maintain, and operate new student recreation 
facilities . 

The question will appear on the ballot as follows: 
"Shall the Students of the University of California at San 

Diego assess themselves a fee of $6.50 per quarter per 
student for a period of up to 25 years for the sole purpose 
of constructing, maintaining, and operating Student 
Recreation Facilities consisting of a swimming pool, 
jacuzzi, five racquetball/ handball courts, and a 
shower /locker room located just north of the Warren 
West Field, a jacuzzi at the Natatorium. and night lighting 
on the Muir Field, said Facilities to be govemed by the 

--

The Daily Guardian 11 

Bulletin 
Student Recreation Facilities Charter?" 

It is estimated that the proposed facilities will cost 
$1 ,219,000 and will be paid for with an 11.5% Regents 
Loan. Based on an enrollment of 10,000 students, the 
$6.50 fee will generate $195,000 annually, of which 
$150,000 will cover the payback of the loan, leaving 
$45,000 for annual maintenance and utility costs. 

The loan will be fully paid in 25 years; at the end of the 25-
year payback period, there will be a direct all·student vote 
to approve a new fee level (or continued maintenance and 
operation. 

This referendum question has been initiated, planned, 
and proposed by students working for student interests, 
with full professional and technical support. 

-~ ........ 
... -. : t t 
.... 1' ... 

• The quarterly assessment will not begin until 
completion of construction/occupancy of these faci~ties . 
Students will pay for the facilities available for use. 

The construction wiD be completed with no trees 
eliminated. Solar heating and natural ventilation will 
reduce maintenance costs and external energy 
dependence. 

Students on financial aids will not be personally 
assessed this fee inasmuch as the financial aids package 
includes all required fees. 

There win be no additional user fees to registered 
students. 

Governance of these student recreational facitities will 
reside in a body composed 01 voting student members, 
augmented by non·votb g consultants . 

The Department of Physical Education has guaranteed 
that a portion of faculty/staff user fees at least equal to the 
student assessment of $6.50 per quarter per user wiU be ' 
released by the P. E. Dept. to the student goveming board. 

The increase in the assessment over last spring's 
referendum is due solely to increased construction costs 
and a higher interest rate on the loan. 

The referendum requires a 2/3 majority vote to be 
enacted. Voter turnout must be at least 25% of the student 
population.

concerned with the development and implementation 01 
the UCSO Studenl Alfirl11lltive Action Program by 
identifying and articulating affirmative aciton needs of the 
campus student population. 

Working in this capacity has increased and developed 
my skill and expertise in working with varied and diverse 
groups of people with different needs, aspirations and 
interests. Also, I am an active member in the Black 
Students Union with a long and distinguished history of 
service in the local San Diego community. This campus 
and community involvement puts me in an advantageous 
position to contribute to and develop upon the work 
performed by last year'. A.S. Council. 

I am currently a senior, majoring in Communications 
and Socioloml. I would like to propose and implement 
projects and programs that lend themselves to 
CONSTRUCTIVE ACTION and will bring respect to 
UCSD. Vour wle for me wiD be a vote for new energy and

Barry Hym_ 
AS Preaiclent 

There is a need to expand the parameters attributed by 
the bureaucracy to student goyernment. We need to 
create space for students to transform the AS from 

"~nance" to outreach. Many problems face UCSD-
the health and welfare 01 the oomfftlnity are at stake! 

We are confronted with dangerous research labs, poor 
teaching, inadequate funding for student organizations 
Inf media, the final dismantling 01 Lumumba Zapata. The 
AS _created by the AdmirUtration to divide students, it 
can not 10M! th .. , or equally pressing problems. Rather, 
ltudentl must be brought together through co-
apefltion-we must re·aeate a student power base. We 
mUll dismantle the bureaucracies that repress and 
institute real aoiutions. 

Real outreach to the minority community, rlther than 
perpetuation of an ineHective EOP bureaucracy, is 
nec .... ry. Spaces must be aeated for students to live and 
lam. Academic programs must be strengthened. We 
need to Imdo the fractioning and sandbox attitudes thlt 
Iftect us aI. 

I am N'lni!ls with the PROGRESSIVE COAUnON, 
which has been working tor ttie past few yean on these, 
and other, concerns. Support us on April 23124.

Kathleen Shanahan 
AS President 

UC San Diego is unique in it's established college 
system Each college has it's own identity and focus . 
College priority believes in that individuality and wants to 
emphasize a communication network between the 
colleges and the Associated Student Government next 
year. ServingasanAs Rep from ReveUe College this year, I 
felt that the AS often represented a small constituency 
within the Student Center and cid not make a concerted 
effort to reach out to the colleges via the college councils 
and other college representatives (dorm residents and 
commuters) . The AS was a 5th entity serving only special 
interest groups - this is what I would change. 

Next year, with a new chancellor and . new 
administration, will be a year of change and iMOIIation. 
Establishing and maintaining open communication 
between students and administration must be a major 
focus. 

Retention and recruitment are major areas of COl'lCern 
lor the continuation of UCSD. I hope to innovate some 
positive direction in both these areas along with continued 
work on construction of the Amphitheater, Rec facilities 
and housing problems (ie. condo conversion, rent 
control). Budget cuts, with orwithout Prop 9 prove to be 
inevitable. We must prioritize student needs. 

Having been an integral part of ReveRe College for 4 
years and working this past year on AS,I have represented 
my constituencies in all instances. My past record speaks 
lor itself. My luture will address your priorities; COLLEGE 
PRIORITY. Vote COLLEGE PRIORITY - lIOteKathleen

Robb Strom 
AS President 

My name is Robb Strom and I'm running for the office of 
AS President. Throughout this palt year, I have been an 
active member of the AS Council and have therefore 
participated in identifying and solving many of the 
problems this years student gowrnment has laced. I am 
also proud to have played an instrumental role in the 
lormation of Asaorted Vinyl, the fiTst ASCo-op. Although I 
can reflect upon my term .. Muir College Representative 
with a sense of accompl*,ment, I realize that many 
problema haw yet to be .oIwd. 

UCSD has recently acquired a new chancellor. At this 
critical time, the relationship between students Ind 
administration must be clearly defined in order that 
student needs can be adequately rep ..... nted. I will 
propose to the new chancellor that a special committee be 
established to act .. a direct link between student needs 
and administraIM reaporwe. This committee would 
consist of a repretentative from ellCh college and would 
thereby give coflege go-..oernmentl a more inte!J'al role in 

Monday, April 21, 1980 

important student decisions. 
In this upcoming year I forsee the complete student 

takeover of University Events. Recent major changes in 
UEO administration have made this possibility seem very 
real. 

Another problem that must immediately be dealt with is 
the increase in minority enrollment at UCSD in general 
and at Third (lumumba-Zapat~) College, in specilic. 

The relationship between the AS and the Student 
Center Board must be clarified il there is to be responsible 
development in our Student Center. These priorities along 
with Proposition 9 and a host of others left unmentioned 
must be coordinated by an AS President who has the 
experience and incentive to follow through until we get the 
right results . On April 23 and 24eleclan oIlicerwho is both 
sensible and sincere . Vote Robb Strom for AS President. 

Conrado Gerardo 
Vice-President 

As a candidate for ASUCSD Vice· President, I consider 
myself well qualified to assume the duties and 
responsibilities of this office. My qualifications come from 
a long history of political student activism, not only within 
the realm of student government at the J.e. level, but as 
well as in the Chicano community of Phoenix and Mesa, 
Ariz. Here are a few examples 01 my development : 1968; 
Chair'person of the MEChA Maricopa Tech, 
College .. . 1969; Vice· President 01 A .S. council 
M.T.C .... 1970; Member of A.S. council at Mesa 
Community CoUege ... 1972·74; Member of organizing 
committee 01 Casa De Ia Raza in Mesa Arizona. plus 
worked with the United Farmworkers Organizing 
Committee through this organization ... 1978; Vice· 
Chairperson MEChA UCSD ... 1979; Treasurer MEChA 
UCSD. 

In the r.vo years I have attended this university, I have 
participated in various functions 01 the AS and on several 
occasions have addressed the council in matters of 
budget, organization, and the attitudes which prevail 
about students organizations within the AS. 

TIle leadership abilities which I have acquired in the past 
years have proven to be effective and necessary in dealing 
with people within the administrative and political arena at 
UCSD. It is important to mention that the only promises 
that this candidate is making, is to demonstrate ~

There are 8000 undergraduates at UCSD, many of 
whom leel that the AS Council doesn't address their 
needs . Efforts to build a young AS have had mixed results. 
The AS has not been run efficiently enough to both 
perform its job and keep in touch with what the students 
really want. Do you think the AS is out of touch? College 
Priority means a return to college· level concerns and the 
needs of It.! larger student body. AS, working together 
and coordinating all the people in the colleges, is a more 
representative body. The AS is the coordinator and a 
participant, it is nOt a fifth college. College Priority is strong 
advocacy lor student recreation facilities', the 
amphitheatre, student organizations. college 
!pvernments, increased student·affordable housing and 
more. An AS has got to be part of who the students really 
are. . 

The importance of a well·run AS,like any organization, 
is the difference between effective results and 
bureaucracy. Ability and dedication are required in no 
smaI amount. The job ci Vice-President is difficult and 
time -consuming. It can make the difference between 
delivering what 8000 students need and serving only the 
f_ in the AS. CoDege Priority is the dedication to do it 
well.

This year more than ewr your selection of student 
1eaders could have strong ramifications on your future. 
We are laced with the unsettling prospects of Jarvis D. A 
l'IJmber 01 students could be forced to withdraw from 
IChooI if tuition is instituted TIle students need to know 
who are the best candidates. Students who wiDaclamantly 
defend student rights, for instance, by opposing tuition are 
needed. 

Salient issues Ihe AS mijat reconcile next year include 
the dismantling of EOP, the smooth restructuring of the 
university administration by chancellor designate 
Atkinton and the protection of student interests against 
cuts in lervices inflicted by the regents. 

TIle following reMoOl are why I believe I am the most 
qualified caadidate for Vice President. This put year I 
have eerved .. Activity Fee Board Chair working with 180 
student organizations. I haw aought .. Chair to always 
hale aD Itudent organizations content about their funding. 
I believe an important attribute at a VICe President is the 
ability to work with oJ students. I have also served a year 
III college iePietentaIM to the AS Counc iI. I have learned 
that each individual college is important and I could 
effectively communicate with each of the colleges. 

Because 250 words is not enough to convey which 
student is qualified I wiD be available at ReveRe and Muir 
llllery day of the election. I believe you wiD find Saba, 
Topkis, GriaIva, WheeIer,and Kelley compose the team 
most capable of representing student interests.

very silly student thus qualifies me for the position of ViCe 
President. Being very ai1Iy il of the utmost importance 
while presiding 0\Iel' an AS Council meeting. Silly can 
place issues in their proper perspective. 

My concerns include: the instaDation of dri\Ie·thru 
windows at the bookstore, providin9 chocolate milk and 
graham aackers for snacks and mats lor afternoon naps, 
conwrting the Revelle Fountain into a redwood hottub, 
acting upon the proposed UCSD subway system to 
decrease transit time between classes, and at this time 
there is not truth to the rumor that I plan to compete in the 
Moscow summer Olympics. . 

I would like to cOl'lClude by noting, unlike other political 
figures, when I leave office the profits from my memoirs 
will go directly to the students of UCSD.

Academic Affaire 

TIle vast majority of UCSD ltudentsdo not ralize the 
infh.mICe that the office ci Commillioner of Academic 
Affairs can have on the quality of their educations. The 
individual in this post represents the lIOCe of the students 
to the Facuhy Academic Senate. That their lIOice is not 
being fuIy represented is evident by the number of people 
who h_ never heard of the position. The claim tht 
student apathy limits the accountability of the 
commissioner to his constituents does not address the 
question of efficacy. If the individual elected to this post is 
to be truly representative he must have ongoing student 
contact. I propose to do this through at least three ways: 
l)regularly scheduled student polls, 2)closer work with 
academic clubs, and 3)decentralization of the 
responsibilities 01 the Commissioner to involve more 
people. During each year there are many issues without 
clear solutions. h is imperative that those of you elect to 
repretent you know what you want before they act. 

My goals for the next year invlude but are not limited to: 
A)r.g,ting the passage of Prop. 9 (Jarvis II), B)F'l9hting the 
implementation of tuition, C)Using student solutions to 
the problem of minority recruitment '· such as student 
recruiters returning to their high schools, D)Taking a 
cIoeer Iopk at the attrition rate at UC~D (hishes.t 01 allUC 
carnputea), E)Addrelling the growing inhalance of 
research to leaching, F)Supporting the expansion of 
interm.ciplinary programs.

My goal is to establish a comiaaion that iePiiEWnts the 
wide range of academic m.ciplines, department .. 
individuality of college requirement5 and .tudent 
concerns. Increased student participation wiD achieve 
these goals : l)By using college representatives to serve III

instigated by academic diasatisfaciton. 

With the ongoing administratlw changes, I will have the 
opportunity to work closely with a new Vice-Chancellor ci

participation, combined with my ability to work with the 
University's administration, will enable a strong

of Extemal AIfIIn. This office. which requires dOle 
contact wit the lW'rOIftfing UCSD community, other UC 

ca~, and the ltate gowmment is of urmo.t 
importance to me when it COl1llll to having a atrong 
.tudent wice to articulate the UCSD .tudent.' opinion or

Being inuoIued n variouI organizationl, such as the 
committee on Educational Policy, varioe committees with 
MEChA, that have required contacts with UCSD 
acmlniltratorl, the Educational Opportunity Program 
Student Advisory Committee, has given me the

levels which have an important impact on the life of UCSD 
.tuclen... For example, Proposition 9, the proposed 
reinstatement of the Draft, and different policies of 
AtmnatM Action. 

It is about time that CONSTRUCTIVE ACTION be 
taken to bring relpeet to ASUCSD. It is with this intention ' 
that I plan to perform and fulfill the duties of this office. It is 
through a strong lIOice and your wte for JUAN TORRES 
for COMMISSIONER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS that this 
goal can be achieved. 

Warren Wheeler 
Exteraal Affairs 
1l1e External Affairs commissioner must fight for the 
stu~':"t. intersts wi~h.off campus deeision makers, be they 
pohtlclans, adminIstrators, businesspersons , or 
whomever. My perspective on student interests starts 
with the observtion that student power has waned. Ten or 
fifteen years ago, students were an organized force that 
had to be reckoned with by those politicians and 
administrators and virtually all of society. As External 
Affairs commissioner I wiD work to organize student 
power once again, I will be a strong voice for student 
interests, and fight aggressively against special interests 
which oppose us. By special interests I m(~an the interests 
of administrators who seek to impose unprecedented 
tuitions upon us; the interests of land developers who 
encircle the campus with shopping centers while 

~easonable priced housing is impossible to find ; the 
Interests of apartment owners who sek to eliminate all rent 
control laws and gain unlimited rights to raise rents 
(Proposition 10 on the June 3 ballot). 

As the current director of the Student Lobby Annex, I 
have been actively informing students about issues which 
alfeet them (for example, through tabling t Revelle Plaza) 
and facilitating student input to the policy making process 

The Daily Guardian 

(by organizing direct contacts with localll!!jslators and the 
Regents). These are important first steps in organizing 
student power and I will continue to servie the students in 
this way. 

My work with CaiPIRG (I am currently a member of 
CalPIRG's Regional Board) has impressed upon me the 
importance of researc hing issues and providing all the 
information available so that students can make inforlTll!d 
decisions and take appropriate actions. One of my goals is 
to establish a program at the Associated Students where 
students can receive academic credit for researching 
policy issues of concern to students and report their 
findings to the student body. This is a cruciallllCOnd step 
in organizing student power. By generating our own 

infor~tion and evaluations, we can bejjn not only 
~eactlOg to. external events but initiating fawrable changes 
In our enVIronment.

~ell, folks, tlere it comes. Another political paragraph 
to Instantly transform you into an enthusiastic and 
supportive voter. Sure. Nice to say, but still the very 
essence of public relations. 

Why me? On and off campus situations are familiar with 
my background, living in scenic Argo Hall for two years 
and now this year in Del Mar: 1 am will aware of two ver~ 

sepa~ate and distinct types of organizations, each of which 
requIres unity and communication in order to be 
productive. Participating in the Intercollegiate sports 
program for 3 consecutive years, and working with Revelle 
Hall Program Advisors. This background since it deals 
directly with ~tudents and how they live and work together 
Within a parllcular setting, provides me with an abmty to 
personally relate to the student body. 

I! is essential for an AS Public Relations Person, to keep 
a two·way line of communication open to inform the 
students. The AS Bulletin is an important method of 

~elaying information to students . The difficulty, however, 
IS to get students aware, stop, and read it. 

TGIF's are crucial in that they bring the four colleges 
together . It is here that student governmental 
communication should expand. Students need a 
personable and knowledgable voice to inform them of 
"what's happening". As a sociable and energetic person, I 
can talk to you, and you can talk to me.

Programming 

The. following excerpt was taken from the advisory 
comnutlee on student programming written by Karen 
Roberts, three years ago. Do any of these problems look 
familiar? . 

M ••• Realizing that UCSD is a tense, competitive school, 
the programs provided do not relieve and release tension. 
They do not provide channels for meeting other atudentl 
and relieving loneliness. Student development is not 
stressed as it should be. Inatead easily presented events 
are planned; films, dances, concerts, etc . Granted these 
are needed, .. are the MsociaIizers." The drop-out rate and

Respectfully, Joshua Harris, Commi •• ion.r of 
Programming. 

As your Commissioner of Programming I will provide 
you with an opportunity to gain more from sc hooI than 
academics. I wiD support effective old prografnl such as 
TG's, Pub events and intramurals, while initiating new 
one's mainly on a more long range scale. My Utile League 
plan is an example of this type of long range scheme. In this 
p1i!11 the four colleges will sponsor a team in the La Jolla 
Mustang League, each team complete with manager, four 
coaches, and three team "mothers". Not only does this 
type of program provide player. coaches and especially 
fans with an excellent opportunity to meet and make new 
friends, it will also help create a baj:IIy needed rapports with 
the surrounding La Jolla community. The emph .. is on

Jules s. Bagneris 
Activity Fee 

I'm a candidate for Activity Fee Commissioner because . 
of my concern for the proper allocation of the $18.00 a year 
paid by every student to the ASUCSD. I have actively 
served on the Third College Program Board, the Third 
College Council, as an AS Representative, and on the 
Master Plan Subcommittee for the Student Center Board. 
While serving in these positions, I have acquired a 
knowledge of budgets and the need to allocate funds fairly 
according to the needs of the organizaiton. With prices 

~ontinuously on the rise and possible tuition for next year 
In response to Proposition 9, every dollar must be used 
effectively and efficiently to meet student needs. 

Student needs are met through AS support of 
organizations. When organizations are able to acquire 
money to put on activities and events, the quality of life on 
campus is improved . Therefore there is an 
interrelationship between activities and quality of life on 
caml?us .. I plan to develop a formula for allocating money 
that IS faIr to all groups. This will allow organizaitons to put 
on events that reflect more the interests of the student 
population. 

My desire is to help student organizations meet your 
needs. The quality of li fe on campus can be improved 
through effective and efficient use of the activity fee. Let's 
bnng respect to ASUCSD by electing a blueprint for 
constructive action. Serving to meet student needs IS 
Jules Bagneris' goal as Activi ty Fee Commissioner. 
candidates statements 

Jon Bekken 
. Activity Fee 

Over the last few years the AS bureaucracy has been 
consumi'lg unconscionable amounts of student fee 
money, while organizations have been unable to obtain 
adequate funds for their programming activities. 

We need to utilize student fees for students - not for an 
ever-increasing AS bureaucracy. Student funds need to be 
freed from administrative control. A higher priority needs 
to be placed on free programs - on programs for all 
students. 

The bureaucracy confronted by those engaged in 
programming needs to be reduced. Too much time and 
energy is wasted that could be devoted to programming. 

Posting regulations need to be revised, so that it is no 
~ a violation of University regulations to publicize 
event • . A student WII8 recently arrested for posting flyers 
... nOWlCing a film. This cannot be tolerated. 

What qualifies me for this position? Owr the lut few 
years I have worked extenlively with Itudent 
organizations, and haw worked on a wide variety of 
programs - rarVni from concerti to lectures to filma. 

The Daily Guardian 

Through my.two years on the AS Council I have gained 
an understanding of the bureaucratic processes - and 
how to work around them. I know what it takes to put on 
events, and have the knowledge to intelligently judge 
budget proposals. 

I ~m running on a slate with a platform of similar goals 
ranging from strengthened affirmative action and 
increased minority enrollment to stude nts on tenure 
committees and fiHhting tuition hikes. I! may be difficult to 
distinguish between the rhetoric of the various candidates 
and slates in the coming days; you'll have to endure yet 
another election spearheaded by the same status·quo 
bureaucrats of years past. 

A vote for Jon Bekken and the Progressive Coalition on 
April 23/ 24 will yield definite results - through more and 
better programming and active advocacy for student 
interests - next year and beyond.

UCSD would be a better place if it weren't for the AS. 

Most students, however, have resigned themselves to its 
oontinued existence and decided to make the best of it . 
Some have done this by heeding the divine call of nature to 
serve their fellow students. Us fellow students have largely 
become immune to the actions and activities of the AS 
(you kiss your activity fee good-bye painlessly and 
automatically along with your other fees every quarter). 
Another sizeable group of students would like to see the 
AS transformed from an institution of arbitrary 
governance to a resource center for the UCSD 
community. 

This transformation cannot come about until the 
resources of the community are tapped. 1l1e role 01 the 
Elections Commissioner is vital here in that the impre8llion 
of the AS perceived ~ the students around election time 
(the only time when their limited input is solicited) is 
controlled by his/her commission. One of my goals in the 
realm of overdue AS reforms as Commissioner of 
Elections would be the humanization of the new 
teehnocratically oriented elections process. 

I am running on a slate with a platform composed of 
similar reformation goals ranging from strengthened 
affirmative action and increased minority enrollment on

ElectioDs 

Commissioner of Elections is often known as being a 
one quarter job in which the chief purpose is to plan and 
run the ASUCSD elections. Being that the job is 
concentrated in the third quarter, very few of the previous 
commillioners felt it was necessary to do any work 
beforehand. They would be ineffective on the job until the 
time of elections would come up. There are things 
howewr, that can be clone by the elections commissioner 
that would be beneficial to the students other than 
watching time go by. I would like to develop a poll system 
for UCSD, one that would ask the students for their 
opinions of current issues. With poll statistics to work 
with, the AS council will know exactly how the students 
feel on thOle issues, and not have to use the current 
system of guessing. This would better enable the AS 
council to serw the students needs. h does not have to be 
expensiw eithr; work study students can be used for the 
job, thul soo. will be funded by the Federal gowrnment. 
Th' campus as a lIIhoie will benefit, not only by having a

Appointments & Evaluations 

I have been involved this year in the STUDENT FOOD 
COOP as a core member. The process of cooperative, 
democratic decision making is an invaluable learning 
experience. This structure of act ive participation of all 
members must be extended to all areas of our student 
government. 

Student participation in the decision making process on 
this campus is sadly lacking. This situation is intolerable in 
light of the many opportunities to involve ourselves in 
directing factors which effect our daily lives. Student 
involvement is essential if we are to be trul~' represented by 
our A.S . 

Numerous committee appointments . most of an 
advisory nature, have been established to represent 
student interests on issues of concem to all of us. 
Academic programming, budget allocations, educational 
and administrative policy decisions are just a few of these. 

The role of Appointments and Evaluations 
Commissioner is to make sure that students are aware of 
the availability and need for representation. College 
Councils, Resident Advisors, and campus publications 
must all take an active part in this communication. 
Selection processes will be democratic; handled by a 
committee representing all facets of student interest, 
specifically, but not limited to, the four college councils, 
Student Affirmative Action Committee, Coops and 
student enterprises, and other student organizations. 

The Daily Culrclan 

Evaluation of the caliber of representation will also be 
the responsibility of this same committee. To assure 
superior student representation this evaluation win be an 
ongoing process with accessible lines of communication 
open to all of us. 

My first priority is your involvement in our ASUCSD.

Appointments & Evaluations 

My name is Louis Madrigal and I am seeking the position 
of Commissioner of Appointments and Evaluations. I am a 
junior at Third College and in the past have been involved 
in various student concelns on campus. I believe that it is 
important for students to become aware of what is going 
on around campus and to take interest 10 what student 
government has to offer them. 

Throughout my education I have found that working to 
become a part of student operations is well worth the 
effort and can work to the benefit of all . As an American 
Indian student I have represented our organization on the 
Student Affirmative Action Committee this year and have 
come into contact with student campus committees as 
well as faculty and staff administration . As officer of 
Appointments and Evaluations to the ASUCSD I will be 
working toward giving campus committees their best 
representation by appointing qualified committee 
members to involw themselves on important matters 
affecting students.

student government and we hope you win ~ us your

But seriously, when I'm elected, nI work hard for 
everything that's good and fight against everything that's 
bad. I will do what you want. 

The commissioner of student welfare's main job is to 
handle grievances against professors or the

when I lost my rubber duckie, I grieved for hours. 111 bet 
that none of my opponents have similar qualifICations. 

And as commissioner,l will look out for student rights.

Student Welfare has had a highly underestimated

First I'd like io say hello. I'm Bob Spielmann, a Warren 
College student, and have been here for two years. As a 
member of the Activity Fee Board and various Student 
Organizations it has become apparent that "student ' 
apathy" is just a convenient label. It is used by people that 
have oot made the effort to talk to students about their 
concems on an individual basis. More recently, as a 
member of the Third College Judicial Board and 
coordinator of a task force designed to reprsent student 
opinion on the Drop·Date Proposal, I have become highly 
aware of student needs. 

Retention is a major problem at UCSD and might get 
worse. As students, we've never had a fair and quick 
process to voice our academic and administrative 
concems. Well take a look at what we've had to deal .with. 
l)A strong, unflexible faculty and 2)An existing but lengthy 
appeal process which makes the whole thing a hassle 
anyway. As Commisioner of Student Welfare I plan to do 
something about that. 

My goals for next year include I)Advocating rights and 
informing s tudents, 2) A program designed to deal with 
abuse of rights, grade disputes and sexual harassment. All 
problems will be handled confidentially and be dealt with 
as quickly as possible. I am asking for your support. Vote 
for Action not Politics. 

Reggie Williams 
Student Welfare 

There is a need at UCSD to strengthen 
communications between students and theA.5. The most 
cornmon remarks I've heard by students on their 
relationship with the A.S. have been "should know more 
about the A.S." and "where is it?". This is very disturbing 
in view of the fact that every registered undergraduate is 
automatically a member of ASUCSD. The A.S. council 
has a responsibitity to it members, the first step to take 
would be to come down from their offices and get in touch 
with the students to understand their ide. and needs. 

College should be a learning experience and as such 
students should feel involved To cultivate such an 
environment the A.S. should be more accessible to all its 
members. 

As Conmissioner 01 Student Welfare and member at 
the ACUCSD council I will be advocating greater A.S. 

Monday, April 21, 1980 

involvement in coordinating student ideas and needs to 
enhance your college experience. Other duties that I will 
carry out willb e to act as a Iiason in handling grievances 
against a professor or an administrator via the student 
advocate program. The commissioner also deals in other 
areas where student rights or welfare is infringed upon. 
During the last academic year I gained valuable insight of 
the duties of the Commissioner while working on the 
student advocate program handling grade appeals . 

By voting for Reggie Williams you have my sincere 
guarantee that I will actively dedicate myself to represent 
student needs and welfare. Vote and help shape UCSD's 
future. 

Andrew Black 
Muir Representative 

It is my intent if elected to represent Muir College 
students in the strongest possible way. I think that in the 
upcoming year if Proposition 9 passes we will need the best 
possible representation in Student Government. If we do 
not get that representation we could see dorm fees go up, 
tuition imposed and faculty fired without much recourse. 

I also intend to attend every Muir College house meeting 
in order to solicit and induce st udent involvement. I think 
that if I can form committees of students around issues 
which they are immediately concerned with, I can also get 
students involved in the academic and administrative 
committees which are already in existence. 

I also think that it is possible for students to have much 
more control over their lives if they are made more aware 
01 the ways that this can be accomplished . 

Pam Gerber 
Muir RepreseDtative 

As a Muir Representatiw,l would like to do just that. My 
intentions are to increase and clarify communications 
between the Associated Students Council and the Muir 
College Council. This, in tum, could make life more 
pleasant for Muir students, since they could rely' on 
accurate information. 

Up until now, there has been a great deal of confusion 
preoccupying the interaction between the A.S. and the 
M.C.C . Ita Muir Representative, I wiD encourage more 
emphasis in the activities at the college, rather than the 
process of creating the activity, allowing for more student 
illllOlvement. 

With the cooperation of the councils, it wiD be possible 
to get far more accomplished, with far Iue confusion. 

Vote for me. I'm honest. 

The Daily Guardian 

Bruce Lyons 
Muir Representative 

The position of Muir Representative to the AS has long 
been one of low visibility and seemingly little importance. 
Bruce Lyons intends to change the status quo and make 
the job, one of prestige. Most Muir students have had little 
or no contact with the '79·80 representatives, but if Lyons 
is elected he will not only make himself available, but he will 
actively seek the opinions of Muir students through the 
dorms and apartments. Along this principle, Bruce has 
been talking to students discussing opinions on the issues 
of this campaign. Bruce has formed the following opinions: 
He supports the proposed Add/Drop change (where one 
may drop up to nine weeks, but after four weeks a W is 
added to the transcript) as a more accurate reflection of 
one's work at UCSD; he supports the proposed student 
recreation fee referendum, as a needed expansion of 
recreational facilities on campus; he opposes paying the 
Muir College Council Chair, as a wasteful use of limited 
funds; and he opposes Proposition 9 and the possibility of 
placing all of the burden on students through tuition. 
Bruce has been a member of the CalPIRG Regional Board 
for this past year through which he has expanded UCSD's 
role in the community and in CalPIRG. Bruce has been 
campaigning for the presidential candidate in the primary; 
he believes to best represent Bruce's ideals. Bruce works 
for what he believes, and as A$ Representative he wiU do 
the same. Elect Lyons, "He's Nobody's Patsy." 

Martha Lynn Bauman 
Revelle RepreseDtative 

The present AS is but 2 years old and struggling to 
achieve a sense of importance and identity not only with 
the administration but also the student body. In past the 
council has tended to support special interest groups and 
often times has failed to represent the true needs of the 
student community; consequently, my main goal is to 
significantly increase student input into the decision 
making process of the council. Moreover, if the 
foreseeable budget cuts become a reality we as students at 
Revelle have a right to know exactly how, why, and where 
our money is allocated, for the AS should not carelessly 
throw away its funds. Additionally, I see the need to keep 
the Revelle College Council (RCC) more informed about 
AS decisions and considerations and I shall endeavor to 
act as a liason between the AS and RCC. Based on my 
past experience as an RA, orientation leader, and at 
present a Dean's Office intern, I feel as though I'm very 
familiar with both the needs of the Revelle College 
Community and the workings of student government. 
last and certainly not least, rm not afraid to speak upand 
defend the rights and needs of Revelle students. 
Consequently, I consider myself to be an outspoken 
advocate of student rights. 

Clara Chang 
Re"eUe Representative ' 

17 

I am running for the position of AS Rep, because I would 
like to see all students represented, and I feel that my 
views as well as my qualifications make me well·suited for 
the job. 

For my qualifications, in my three years at UCSD, I have 
served as the Revelle appointment to the Counseling and 
Psyche Committee, been a member of the Revelle 
Program Board, and am presently on the Revelle College 
Council, where we have discussed such issues as the 
Fourth Week Drop Date Proposal and revisions in the 
Revelle curriculum. Thus, I feel thai I am now prepared to 
take the experience and knowledge I have acquired as to 
what the students would like to see, and deal with issues 
on a broader scale. 

As for my views, my primary concern is that aU students 
are represented. It is my belief, that there is an acute lack 
of student interest in the affairs of the school which is 
largely due to the fact that many students believe that their 
views are not and will not be heard, and consequently "-
ceased to voice them. However, I feel that these 
dscouraged students do have definite ideas regBrding the 
state of affairs at this school and would gladly provide them 
if given the chance. As AS Rep, I would strive to seek out 
those unheard students and voice their opinions along 
with those of all others to the best of my abitity. 

Aiden Clarke 
Re"elle Representative 
In speaking with Revelle students over the past few 

weeks, it seeems clear that they are relatively satisfied with 
the academic side of their education but not with its sociaJ 
side. Although I recognize that some change, like giving 
students an active role in selecting professors for tenure, is 
needed, I am mostly satisfied with our academic program. 
Socially, though, there isa lot to be done, especially for our 
large group of commuter students who find little incentive 
to return to school after classes are over. 

I have many times wondered why there weren't more 
events like movies, concerts or guest speakers (academic 
and otherwise), and why much of the entertainment we 
have had is inconveniently scheduled in the middle of the 
week. I feel it would be a great addition to our education if 
there were more things to do outside the ocmpetitive 
classroom where students could get together, if for no 
other reason than to be in one place with other students. 

I have spent enough time 'wondering' and it is time I did 
something. As coUege representative I can maximize my 
effectiveness on these issues especially as they relate to 
Revelle College. Therefore, as a representative from 
Revelle, I will vote yes on aU questions concerning 
communication, funds allocation, and programming that 
conveniently offer Revelle students a social option. Why 
settle for less? 

David Depolo 
Revelle Representative

My experience includes: Revelle Resident Advisor (RA), 
Rellelle Hall Program Adllisors (HPA), Rellelle 
Organizational Committee (ROC), Vice Chancellor's 
Programming Polic ies Committee (AS), Student 
Organizations (SOAP, PLEA, CSEA), Political Science 
Major. 

Things I am currently doing for students at Revelle and 
in the AS: TIle rellOlllltion of the "Ubiquit~·" disco (it is now 
a IUccessful Friday night nightclub), the piano room 
situation (I halll! initiated a self·supporting piano rental 
program), pushing for a new structural programming 
propoel in committee, working on the developoment of 
the amphitheatre to bring bigger and better concerts and 
prograr11l to UCSO. 

Problema that need IOlutions in communication: 
between the AS and Revelle students, between the 
members 01 the AS Council, informing Revelle students 
how !hey can benefit from the money gil.ten to the AS 
Council. My JlI'OPC*d IOlutionl include a mandatory AS 
Rep on ROC and a mandatory AS Rep bi·weekly bulletin. 
A problem in expansion of an increase in student 
inIIoIIIl!ment in both opinion and 00 interest committees in 
the AS oould be IOIwd by informing students through a 
bulletin as to the benefits they can receiYe by working 
within the AS. Finally, my lOIution to a lack of cooperation 
and lIIIOCiation between the foundational elements of the 
AS Council, the four colleges and their Reps and Councils 
and more lpecifically, Revelle college and the AS Council 
would entail the establishment of AS Rep inter·college 
committee chaired by the vice-President with one Rep 
from each c:oIIege present. 

MOlt candldatea can present the ' problems, but 
workable solutions are the key to a succeaful AS Council. 

Jeff Tesluk 
ReveUe Representative 
n. year, as a member and one-time chairman of the 

Revelle College Council, I halll! become aware of some of 
the workings of the A.S_ Council. It seems there are 
difficulties and confusion on the Council. As an A.S. 
Representative for Revelle it is my goal to alleviate these 
difficulties and the confusion. 

TIle students of Revelle have concerns about their A.S. 
Council. As a Revelle RA last year, I feel I have acquired a 
good !rasp on some 01 these concerns and I would 
represent and voice these concerns to the Council. I 
would also keep the students informed on the happenings 
of the AsIOciated Students Council. 

1 would hope to halll! a Council who can work well 
together; one where everything is "put on the table" and 
the interest 01 the students are top priority. This is 
important to me. 

Revelle students, by choosing me /III one of your A.S. 
Representatives I know you would be well represented on 
the A.S. Counca and you concerns wiD be voiced. 

Patricia Baines 
Third College Rep 

The Daily Guardian 

I, Patrician Baines am running for the position of A.S. 
Representat ive lor T hird College. For three of the four 
years I've attended UCSD I'lie been actively working with 
student o rganiza tions o n Third College such as Peer 
Counseling, Big Brother/ Big Sister, Resident Halls 
Representative, and Affirmative Action a nd Retention 
C ommittee (AARC ). 

From th is exposure I'lie had the opportuni ty to see fif!.t 
hand some of the necessary needs of Third . Many issues 
need to be addressed at UCSD and some of these 
concerns are of particular interest to Th:rd College. 

Issues such as retention, recruitment , tf'nure, 
educational purposes, just to mention a few need the 
support of students who will continue to struggle for the 
original purpose of Third College. 

By filling the position of A.S. Rep. for Third College I 
along with the other Reps., members ofthe ASUCSD, and 
the student body can begin CONSTRUCTIVE ACTION 
toward common goals to help imprOlie the quality of 
student life. 

As an A.S. Rep. I wiU have the opportunity to implement 
ans support programs that will reflect the philosophy and 
goals of Third College. I will also halle the cnance to help 
establish a positive environment that leads to a sense of 
community for Third College. 

It is only with your vote and support that I can begin 
CONSTRUCTIVE ACTION AND BRING RESPECT TO 
ASUCSD. 

Lealie Reed 
Third CoDege Rep 
As students of the TIUd Colege, the issues that we deal 

with and are dedicated to encompass a larger range than 
those of other students at UCSD. As a Third College 
Council Member this year, I became aware of a large 
variety of these concerns. These range from the 
recruitment and retention 01 all students and particularly 
people of color at our school to the general effort of 
making the Third College an enjoyable and effective place 
to Iilll! and pursue an education. I have worked within 
Thrd College, and now it is my purpose to bring Third 
College concerns to the AS and allow the ASUCSD to 
work for us. There is a lot to gain for Third College if we 
can utilize the AS effectively. rd tike to represent Third 
College's ideas in the AS and work to put them into action. 

Kerry Varga 
Third College Rep 

Monday, April 21, 1980 

Hello, my name is Kerry Varga, and I'm running for the 
Third College Representa tive to the A.S ., on the 
Co nstuctive Action Sla te. I came to Third College two 
years ago, a shy person. In my freshman year, I was 
encouraged to get into student leadership. S ince then, I 
have been closely invoilled with the Affirmative Action 
Retention Committee s ince its inception; I am a member of 
th\! Big Brother/ Big Siste r Coordinating Committee: and I 
am this year's Third College Rep. to Parking Services. 

Gel ting inllolved, working for students, on issues I really 
care about, helped me to become less self· conscious. I'm 
still somewhat shy, but now I can speak out strongly, 
fighting for issues that affect students at Third . . 

In the upcoming year, I will work very hard a t keeping an 
eye on what is happening with E.O .P., and the recruitment 
of Affirmative Action students, and at keeping the results 
of JAWS II (prop 9), from severely affecting students 
(particularly at Third) if it passes, making sure that Third's 
Academic programs and it's committment to the 
Affn-mative Action students, are not eliminated. 

I truly admire Third's philosophy of respecting and 
valuing ALL cultures. I feel that we need more of that same 
respect campus· wide. I will stay very close to students at 
TIird, keeping you posted of changes that might affect 
you, learning how you feel on issues, so tha t I can best 
r.-ntyou. 

rm not going to make unrealistic promises. I'm still not a 
poIiIhed politician; just a student who cares. 

Scott Collins 
Warren Repre8entative 

Hi! I'm running for AS Rep from Warren College, and 
I'm running because I want to see some positive changes 
made for Warren CoUege in ths A.S. Specifically, I want to 
see WC taking part in and controlling more of the 
fundtons that the A.S. now handles. For instance, the 
appointment of WC representatives to the various boards 
that the A.S. olll!rsecs (eg. Student Center, Food Co-op) 
should be handled by WC. Why? Because the college 
government is close to W.ren student. than the A.S. is. 
This brings up anothe rpoint: the lack of communication, 
cooperation, and coordination between the college 
councile and the A.S. TIle A.S. has a \IaSI amount of 
relOUrces, and the WC council is sensitized to and aware 
of the student's needs. Combining these two positive 
aspects at the college Iewl would directly benefit the 
students. 

I think that I have the necaury experience for the 
position. having been a member of the Program Board, the 
campus· wide Space·Allocation and Muter·Plan 
committees, a Warren College 01.., Praident 01 RHB. and 
a member of the W.ren College counciL 

Aa a IaIt thought, UCSD had a rww chancellor. Ttit II 
an exceDent opportunity for the A.S. to gain a ItfOl'Vll' 
student voice and more repraentation in adminiltratllll 
and academic matte .... 

rm running fOf poIitiw ~ and I hope that ~ ".. 
giw me the chance to bring the deciIIon-maklng procell 
of the A.S. cloee to home. 

Randy de Ronde 
Warren Repraentative 

Well now, why do I, Randy de Ronde, want to become 
A.S. Representative for Warren College? Good Question. 
First of all my main goal ilto be completely honest with the 
residents of Warren College. With this thought, the only 
promise that I will make, also the only promiIIe any 
candidate can make. iI that I wiD do my bat to fuIfiD your 
idea 01 a perfect A.S. Rep. 

My plans if elected, in short, il to do something about 
the perking situation, and any other problems that you 
want me to bring up at the board meetings. 

All in all, I would appreciate your support in helping me 
to _fill! as a good A.S. Representatilll! for Warren 
College.

Success is not simply to endure life (at UCSD), but to enjoy it. 
Hector Hornblower 

My work with the AS will be directed towards helping the students at 
this campus a chieve their goals as students, in their activities outside the 
lecture ha ll and labora tory. 

Specifically, to re turn respect to the student's representative 
gOliernme nt on campus: The Associated Student Government. 

Secondly, to help speed the completion of the amphitheatre, i.e . to try 
and get the fi rst, or grass, phase done in two years, instead of filll! . 

Third , to work with the student lIoters decision on the Rec Center. 
And again to work with a voters' decision, if Prop 9 should pass. 

Hopefully not, but if it does I will use all means possible to keep tuition 
from being imposed on UC students. This probably being the major issue 
in the eyes of the majority of students. 

There a re many other issues on which my views can be seen 
elsewhere, or just ask me or my workers, we'll be happy to inform. 

In closing, I'd like to mention that I participate in 1M sports and enjoy it, 
and that I want to work with and help o ther students to enjoy the lile at 
UCSD.

Craig Lee 
Warren Representative 

Hi, 
If you don't recognize me from my smiling face, my 

rume Is Craig W. Lee and 1 am running for Associated 
Students Representatiw for Warren College. 111 do my 
bat to be brief since, if you are like me you hate big winded 
speeches. 

I b.Iiew I am WIY well qualified for AS Rep since this 
• .. ''' r 1 haw aerwd on R.idence Hall Board, Program 

lc..~ Warren Cabinet, AS media and Jarvia n 
Committee. All 01 these positions are an integral part 01 
the Warren gowrnment and 1 feel that my experience this 
put ye.- MIl be invaluable in my job as a Warren Rep. To 
be cloler to the center 01 the W.-ren community, ) have 
arrangld to Iiw in the dormitories next year and ) pian to 
be available and open to suggestions from any members of 
the W ... en community. 

It is my desire next year to strengthen communication 
between AIIOCiated Students and Warren community. ) 
want Aa&ociated Students to start standing for "all the 
students" not juat thoee who are elected into offices. Let's 
put Warren on the map! 

Art Sklaroff 
Warren Representative 
As Warren rep. to the A.S. ) will represenL Warren 

College student interest on the A.S . Council. 1 will 01 
course act as a liaison between the Warren College 
Cabinet and the AS, soliciting happenings. But beyond 
this, ) will solicit input and inform students by direct 
interaction in the dorms and apartments at Warren, and 
through the Warren newsletter as well as other campus 
media. The AS council can work for the students if their 
views are accurately represented. This is my foremost 
concern in this election. 

1 earnestly hope that communication will ultimately lead 
to participation. 1 stress the urgent need for students to 
become involwd in the processes which affect them. 
Severe budget cuts are a real and immediate possibility. 1 
strongly oppose Proposition 9, but even the failure of the 
Jarvid initiative will not halt the decrease in student 
services which is already taking place. Through my 
involvement with the Food Coop for the last two years, 1 
have gained insight into the viability and importance of an 
alternative type of structure that fulfills students' needs. 1 
am specifically interested in working toward a student run 
general store, a used textbook service, or expansion 
and! or relocation of the existing Revelle Book coop, and a 
student run transportation system beginning with the 
financially insecure Coast Cruiser. I haw more ideas, but 
I'm most interested in supporting proposals put forth by 
W ... en students. If you want to see positive change, elect 
Marsha Vdovin, Scott Collins, and Art AklarofftotheA.S. 

The Daily Gurdian 

Mark Massara 
Warren Representative 
It should come as no surprise that the university of 

California at San Diego is to receive a new chancellor for 
the 198()'81 school year. The Chancellor-designate, 
Richard Atkinson, had never done any research here or 
even seen the campus before he was chosen to succeed 
Chancellor McElroy. Next year is going to be a transition 
year for UCSO. It is not going to be a particularly easy year 
- especially if Proposition 9 passes - and our 
Chancellor-to-be has a lot to learn about UC San Diego. 

Let me explain why I am seeking the position of 
ASUCSD representatiw for Warren CoUege. As an 
undergraduate I am naturally biased. I want to see the 
undergraduate program at UC San Diego improved. It is 
important that Richard Atkinson understand that 
undergraduate education should not playa secondary role 
to graduate work and faculty research. 

I believe I can influence undergraduate life, both 
academic and social here at UC San Diego. I am a new face 
to the often stagnant student government of UCSD, 
Because I want to bring student government back to the 
students, I am running for the postition of ASUCSD 
Warren College representative. Your vote will be 
appreciated. Thank you.

Marsha Vdovin 
Warren Representative 

Having already served on the AS Council, I am now 
interested in the AS next year as well. I'm running on the 
Positive Change Slate. We feel that there should be more 
student input to both the College Council and the AS. We 
currently feel frustration with the governments and would 
like to eliminate the isolation that these groups have from 
each other. I would personally like to stress that students 
should feel that they are a part of the AS and that the AS is 
there to serve them. The active students on this campus-
a number which is growing- should be involved in the 
decision making instead of people whose main concerns 
are their own egos and resumes and who are trying to 
control those students who are working to help 
themselves and control their own lives - such as the 
people working in the co-ops or political organizations. 

I feel that a second goal is to improve communication 
between the college governments and the AS. It is a job of 
the AS representative to act as a liason between the 
college government and the AS. A requirement for this is 
direct communication and accessability to Warren 
students. In my recent experience as AS representative, I 
feel that I have done my best to represent Warren College 
in the AS and help to maintain the respected position 
which Warren CoUege holds in the AS Council. I'd like to 
produce positive changes in the UCSD student 
government.
