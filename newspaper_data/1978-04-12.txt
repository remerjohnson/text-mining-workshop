Chancellor's Associates give 
unrestricted funds to UCSD 

McElroy backs hike 
of Parking Fees 

Chancellor tells srudents 
there are no altematives by Laura A. Richter and Cimarron Boozer 

For a mere $1,000 per year, 
you can have your own "C" 
parking permit, valid in any 
UCSD parking space and 
parking meters without a fee . 

I 

"It's a pretty expensive 
parking permit, " commented 
Chancellor William McElroy, 
a nd , indeed, becoming a 
Chancellor's Associate implies 
far more than a parking space. 

The 145 Chancellor'S Asso-
ciates contribute to an unres-
tricted fund which is distri-
buted at McElroy's discretion 
mong students, faculty and 

staff for special projects. 
McElroy ays that his " nine 

o'clock group," an assembly of 
all the vice-chancellors 
Assistant Chancellor David 
Ryer, and Ray Ramseyer , 
Special Assistant to the 
Chancellor for Development 
and Public Information, acts as 
an advisory group and reviews 
all requests for funding. If the 
request comes from a specific 
department, the department 
chairman is contacted to 
confirm its legi timacy, 
according to McElroy. 

RamSeyer, who is in charge 
of stimulating and receiving 
private gifts and overseeing the 
dispersment of those gifts for 
the intended purposes through 
the UCSD Foundation and the 

UC Regents, said that "What 
we like best is unrestricted 
money," and that the Chan-
cellor's Associates are one 
source of those funds. 

"It's nice to say 'yes' we have 
the money, 'yes' we can do it," 
said Ramseyer, who explained 
that the state does not cover 
many of the special projects in 
which a university is inter-
ested, or otherwise allocations 
through the state often reauire 
months of waiting before the 
money is received . 

Ramseyer listed several 
purposes for which money 
would be given by the Chan-
cellor, including a recent 
reception held by the UCSD 
Music Department for one of 
the "s hining lights " of 
contemporary music . The 
$4,500 required for the event 
was not available through the 
department but the Chancellor 
felt that the prospect of the 
composer donating a collection 
of hiS written music to UCSD 
warranted the spending, said 
Ramseyer. 

"A scholarly work that could 
never pay for itself" would also 
be a candidate for funds , 
a<.tording to Ramseyer, as are 
student projects such as AS 
President Jeff Leifer's trip to 
Europe last summer to attend a 
Pugwash conference. "It's not 
the kind of thing a student has 
money for, " said Ramseyer. 

McElroy said that his 
interests in allocating the 
money go "across the board." 

Although the current yearly 
expense of being an Associate is 
$1,000, the cost was only $250 
until one year ago, and " didn 't 
produce a whole lot of money, " 
said Ramseyer. Members were 
not excluded from the group if 
they did not go to the higher 
sum, and others have chosen to 
gradually increase their 
donation over a period of years. 

There are also Associates, 
said Ramseyer, who contri-
buted $25,000 in a lump sum to 
become lifetime members.

The conference will consist of workshops on issues of student

Bergsma said that the group

Chancellor McElroy said Monday that while he can appreciate 
the uproar caused by an administration proposal to dramatically 
raise parking fees to pay for one or more parking garages at 
University Hospital , he has not found any viable alternatives to the 
plan. 

"As far as I've been told, we've gone through every possible 
alternative over the past three years, and thi is the plan that is 
considered most viable, " McElroy told a group of four students 
who met with him about the propo al. 

Last Friday, Vice-chancellor of Financial Management H.D. 
Johnson acknowledged, in a meeting with Muir AS Representative 
Gary Moser, that he and other staff members are drawing up a 
comprehensive proposal to double and possibly triple parking fees 
to pay for the garages at the hospital. 

UCSD operates University Hospital in Hillcrest, about ten miles 
southeast of UCSD. Both Johnson and McElroy said more off-
street parking must be found at the hospital because of resident 
complaints that hospital employees ' and patients ' cars are 
crowding the streets around the facility . 

The final propo al the administration releases will then go to the 
Parking Advisory Committee, for its input and recommendations. 
After that, it will be forwarded to the Board of Regents, where 
Johnson expects the plan to be given final approval. 

" This plan, if it's viable, must be in effect by July 1," McElroy 
said . 

The students at the Monday meeting were Moser, Revelle 
parking committee representative Chris Arrott , Warren

Free amphitheatre on way? 
An open-air, grass amphi-

theatre capable of seating 
8,000 people and costing the 
university nothing to build has 
been approved by the Campus 
Community Planning Com-
mittee, according to Campus 
Architect Chuck Powers 

The amphitheatre would be 
located in the canyon north of 
Central Library. 

A flat area about the size of a 
football field would be levelled just below the library. The area 
could be used for studying, 
sleeping on the ,rass, lunch, 
symphonies, major concerts 
and other campus events. 

The method of building the 
amphitheatre at no cost to the 
university involves offering 
local developers a place to 
dump large quanti tie of oil in 
return for the Land caping of 
the oil to th univer ity ' 
specification . 

This method ha be n u ed 
frequently in th pa t a a wa 
for th univ r ity to fend off 
pirating con tru lion ost . 

Because it is very difficult for a 
developer to dispose of several 
100,000 cubic yards of soil , the 
university has often been able 
to offer the developer a place to 
dump the soil in return for some 
amount of work. 

The site of the Basic Science 
Building, which used to be a 
canyon, was filled by this 
method. Over the years the' 
university has obtained many 
$100,OOOs in landscaping and 
grading without spending any 
money, according to Powers. 

A few months ago a North 
County developer 'bid on a 
project that would require the 
disposal of 200,000 to 300,000 
cubic yards of soil. The 
developer contacted Power to 
ee if UCSD could accept the 

soil. 
Pow r r aliz d that thi 

mount of oil w about th 
amount n ded to turn the 
canyon north of ntral

received it on the conditions 
that the soil acquired be a gift 
and that all the work be done at 
once to prevent the site from 
sitting half-finished for any 
length of time. 

Unfortunately for UCSD, the 
developer lost the bid , but 
approval for the concept 
remained . According to 
Powers, all the major contrac-
tors in the area are aware that 
UCSD can disp'ose of large 
quantities of soli and Powers' 
office receive calls from them 
on a re~lar ba i .

h h ld f b ell? Proposition 13: still an enigma W 0 sou 00 t I • Research states, many scho.ols would have to by D. Dougles James close, thu!' victimizing students in the name of 
The a dministration is faced with a dilemma. It needs to provide 

off-street parking for the employees and patients at University 
Hospital, the UCSD-operated facility in Hillcrest. According to 

I Chancellor McElroy. local government will not foot the bill, or 
even part of il, for cost of constructing and maintaining the 
parking garages planned to alleviate the parking problem. 

Since state and federal money cannot be used for construction of 
the garages, some other form of funding must be found. After what 
McElroy describes as "three years of intensive study," campus 
staU decided the only viable form of funding is an increase in 
parking fees, for students, faculty and staff. Within four years, 
fees could rise by as much as ZOO percent. A student permit could 
cost $96 for the school year. 

We find this proposed use of parking fees to be way out of line. We 
understand the hospital is important, and thatoff·street parking is 
necessary, but fail to see why it m ust be paid for by people at 
UCSD, most of whom will never see the facility. 

While McElroy says his staU members have not come up with 
any other alternative funding sources, we feel they did not look 
hard enough. Even though public funding may not be available, 
private funding is a direct possibility. Many wealthy members of 
the San Diego community have taken an interest in UCSD, through 
such grou~ as the Board of Overseers and the Chancellor'S 
Associates. Surely some of these people could be induced to make 
contributions to the well-being of a community institution like 
University Hospital. 

We could name a building after them, or maybe even one of the 
parking garages. 

While private contributors probably would not cover the whole 
tab, the administration could lessen dependence on the garages by 
encouraging transport.ation alternatives such as van-pooling, car-
pooling and private bus services. Perhaps hospital employees 
could be encouraged to use such altemat.ives, by a pplication of 
parking fee rates as high as those that may be forced on UCSD 
staff.

First, the initiative would permit the 
reassement of property only when sold. The 
major industrial plants in this state may never 
be sold and would cary their 1975 assessments 
(plus an inflationary increment of 2% per year) 
indefinitely. Since the average turnover for the 
single-family home is about 7 years, a far 
greater percentage share of the tax burden 
would be shifted to homeowners. 

consequences of this will be a shift oC tax impact 
from business to individuals, and a severe 
curtailment of localized control over the 
provision of government services to the 
residents of this state." 

So once again Californians will be voting on a 
proposal to limit property taxes . Similar 
measures have been brought before voters on at 
least four occasions, and all were de-feated by 
substantial margins. "Wh ile the stated major 
objective of the initiative is property tax reform, 
a goal whiC'h I have supported since first 
elected, " added Larry Kapiloff, " the provisions 
of the proposition woul d lead to major 
disrup tions in the delivery of such services as 
fire and police protection and to a significan t 
sh ift of tax liabilities from business to 
individuals and from the wealthy to middle and 
low-income taxpayers. " 

Secondly, the initiative would require a 2/3s 
vote in the state legislature for passage of all 
measure increasing the level of state taxes, 
thereby permitting a small minority in the 
legislature to overrule the majority. The 
provision is, according to Assemblyman Larry 
Kapiloff, "Contrary to the concept of majority 
rule and representative democracy. Moreover, 
wealthy special interest groups would dominate 
and dictate our tax policy. 

"While the property tax is limited to 1% of 
value," as the initiative's writing states, "no 
formula is given for its distribution to cities. 
counties, schools, etc .. . The result," adds 
Assemblyman Kapiloff, "would be economic 
chaos and the curtailment of many essential 
resources and services as well as a substantial 
loss of Federal funds." 

It might a lso be worth mentioning that Bill 
Jarvis , the initiative's co-author, may not have 
just had intentions on aid ing Californians with a 
tax break, you see ... Mr. Jarvis also happens to 
own somewhere in the neighborhood of 7.500 
apartments scattered throughout the state in 
apartment blocks, and the tax relief from the 
proposal would not only be the general public's 

In all likelihood, as the Senate OUice of advan~age. 
Letters to the Editor 
A way of life changed by God 
Editor: 

Perhaps as you have gone to 
classes you have encountered 
people of certain organizatiom 
trying to introduce you to thei! 
unique way of life, one which they 
claim has been changed by God. 
There are quite a (ew of theSE 
groups: Trident Christian Fellow· 
ship, Jehovah's Witnesses, the 
Bahais , Campus Crusade For 
Christ. the Church of Latter Day 
Saints, and tbe list goes on. Why are 
all these groups of people here? 

Our society has very high rates 01 
crime. divorce, and suicide. The 
pressures of being a pre-med. or 
being any college student with an 
uncertain future, are very real. Do 
people become involved with 
J(roups like these simply to gain a 
false sense of secu rity and to escape 
from all the pressures of life? Or i~ 
there truth to the claim that God is 
real and in his love he can give us 
true purpose and happiness? 

I am a student here. and am 
really no diflerent or better than 
you or any other student. But I 
would like to ask you one more 
question: If God had tenure at 
UCSD, what would he do? 

I believe his answer would be to 
love us . I am a Christian and 
believe that the God who existed in 
Biblical times exists today. His 
love is not just for me or my friends , 
but for everyone on this campus. I 
know that I've often failed to show 
this love the way thalGod wantsme 
to. But God does not fail . He has 
demonstrted his love through the 
life , death, and resurrection of 
Jesus Christ - a love that i for all . 
Becau e a number of others and 
myself have come to recognize that 
God has acted in love towards all 
men, we have begun to experience 
his tremendous joy and purpo e in 
every d tail of our life. And not 
dc iring 0 keep this to oursclves, 
we long to Share thi exp rience 

with you . Therefore , we are 
having a number of presentations 
on campus in which we would like to 
discuss the details of how we have 
come to experience this life.

AS elections important 
Editor: 

The ASUCSD elections will be getting underway this week. I believe that 
the elections this year are really important. Students who have seen a 
blundering, out-of-touch government stagnate will have a chance to elect 
leaders who care about bettering student life and who will begin 
addressing student needs here at UCSD. 

The AS needs a leader who has shown his commitment to bettering 
student life at this university. Gary Moser, as his accomplishments show. 
is such a leader who is in tune with the student community. I applaud Gary 
on his move to open the Pub on campus. Gary has pushed hard through the 
bureaucracy to begin making the Student Center a center (or students. 
Gary, who was a college orientation leader last year. led the battle which 
saved Muir College ' s Activities Coordinator. When Vice·chancellor 
Howard Hunt recommended to cut the position without justification Gary 
led 50 students to the Vice·chancellor's Advisory Committee to present the 
students' case. When Vice·chancellor Howard Hunt spent $110,000 from 
Registration Fee savings over the summer Gary was a member of the 
Advisory Committee who walked out on the process until action which 
gave students more power was taken. Gary' student commitments go on. 

I urge Gary Moser to run for president as he is a student leader who puts 
tudent needs first.

As ociate News Edilor 

" I am pa rticularly proud or Bob Dillon , an a mputee who won the 
state c hampionships on the rings ," sa id Dave Shuster, a UCSD 
student who has coach d both a ble and disabled student in-
gymna tics. Not everyone wanls or n eds to get into comp tition 
but Shuster focused on Dillon as a n example of the potentiai 
po sessed by disabled tudents . 

This quarter t he Phy ical Education Department will offer a 
gymnas tiCS class for disabled students. Participants will have the 
opportunity to use a ll equipment including rings, pa ra llel ba r , 
ba lance beams and trampoline. Tailored for the individual. each 
student will work at his or her own pace, " learning skills that a re 
enjoyable and beneficia l," according to Shuster. 

David Briggs, a specialist in recrea tion therapy, who a lso 
teCiches the adapted phySical education class will conduct the new 
gymnastic program. Shuster has been working closely with 
Brigg to organize the class activities. 

Shuster believes that. "Gy mnastics, being such a diver e sport, 
can be enjoyed by people with prac tically a ny disability." He 
stressed that the instructors are more concerned that "students 
develop bodily control and self confidence, and most important 
have a good time ." Competition is not the major goal of the class. 

Class sessions will be held Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 
4 to 6 pm on the south balcony of the gym. For more information 
contact D avid Briggs in the Physica l Education Dp.partment.

be back in my lap . And if I don't see any other a lterna tives , I'll 
have to approve the plan." 

McElroy said several times thathe can " understand " response 
to the plan , and that he is "sympathetic with it... IfI were a student 
I'd be against it, too. But somebody 's got to bite the bullet and 
make the decision." 

One id a brought up at the meeting by "Moser was that UCSD, 
instead of building the garages, c ould ex plore alternative 
transportalion ideas. such as van· pooling or a private bus service. 

"We are vigorously pushing ca r pooling and van pooling, but we 
can 't force people to do such things ," McElroy said. He added that 
much of the overcrowding is caused by patients, 150,000 of whom 
will use the hospital next year. 

"How would a private bus ervice work with the patients who 
come from all over San Diego?" McElroy said .

AT THE NET - The Tritons' Bill Hein prepares to return a 
shot at the net during Monday's match against USIU. UCSD

Women's tennis 
by Karen Hunter 

Staff Writer 
The time was not right for 

the women's tennis team this 
past weekend at the All-Cal 
Tournament he ld a t UC 
Davi . In the competition the 
team finished a disappointing 
sixth. far be hind the eventual 
winner. UC Santa Barbara . 

Although every team 
member won at least one 
m a tch during the two·day 
event, it was not enough to 
give a team victory against 
a ny opponent. 

Close losses 
Opening day play found 

UCS losing to UC Riverside, 4-
5, and UC Santa Cruz, 4-5. 
Cathy Kozmary, playing in 
the fourth singles and second 
doubles positions, sprained 
her ankle in Friday's doubles 
match . " This affected the 
whole team since we had to 
move up all our players and 
fill in the open spots with 
lower players," explained 
coach ChrIS Mattson. "Some 
of our matches had to be 
forfeited .' , 

Saturday proved to be an 
equally discouraging day as 

the women dropped t wo 
matches , both 0·9, to UC 
Irvine and UC Davis. 

Regular play resumes this 
week as the women meet CSU 
Dominguez Hills on Friday at 
the Muir Courts . 

Men win 
Meanwhile, the men's team 

had better luck as they easily 
defeated US I U , 6-3 , on 
Monday . 

In the number one singles 
position . sophomore Paul 
Metsch got back on the 
winning track with a victory 
over a IOrmer San Diego top junior player, Hartson , 6-0, 6· 
3. " Paul played steady tennis, 
matching strokes with his 
opponent very effectively," 
commented coach Tad Yama-
guchi. 

Close matches took place in 
the number three and six 
singles slots as Bill Hein beat 
Jack Frost, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, and 
Joe Starvish won, 6-2.4-6, 6-l. 
Freshman John Rosenberg 
continued to play well , 
chalking up a decisive 6-2, 6·0 
performance.

The marquee lisht. hlaze hright .. the crowcle thro.g to AI .. Freed'. Big Beat Show at thE 
Brooldvn Paramount in "Americ_ Hot W.", ." 

by Tim Mackenzie 
Arts Editor 

If there's one thing I can't stand anymore it's 
1950s nostalJ;(ia. In a<tdition, I'm C'.onvmced that 
it wasn't nearly as much fun as film makers and 
record producers would lead us to believe . It 
was, I suspect, quite dull. 

To change topics briefly, I've noticed that 
Paramount Pictures is all of a sudden hot to trot 
with " rock 'n roll" movies, including the 
fantastic " Saturday Night Fever" and the soon-
to-be-released " Grease." They' re big money-
makers nowadays ; everyone has heard of 
"Fever" and " Grease", right? 

Well, Paramount obviously figures , " if you're 
hot, you're hot. " So, in between their rock block· 
busters they 've come up with " American Hot 
Wax", which does more to create yellow waxy 
buildup on the luster of Travolta, BeeGees& Co. 
than anything else . It is, ba s ica lly , an 
unnece ary motion picture. 

The story centers around Alan Freed, the 
most influential disc jockey in the business back 
in the late '50. He was, as the film tells us, a 
major reason for the ascent of rock 'n roll in the 
world. By the end of the decade, rock 'n roll had 
come to be considered an obstinate threat by 
many factions of the establishment, so " Hot 
Wax " would have us believe . Sort of

McCarthyism again (so soon'?) . Alan .l<'reed 
became the primary target in the war against 
rock and roll. Thus, the dramatic reason d 'etre 
for " American Hot Wax," 

In addition to a somewhat suspect theme for 
" American Hot Wax", the screenwriters came 
up with a hokey story line that pos e sed little, if 
no, continuity . 

It became painfully obvious a few minute 
into " Hot Wax" that the American public didn ' t 
need another film about '50s rock 'n roll . The 
only saving grace to the film was a good 
performa nce by Tim McIntire a Freed, though 
I wi hed he had a better opportunity to extend 
himself. Indeed, if "America n Hot Wax" had 
concentrated more on the character of Freed 
than on coppi ng out with the cheap '50s 
gimmickry and o·so music, they would have 
had a better film. 

The whole business between Frced '5 
chauffeur (Jay Leno) an d his person al 
secretary Sheryl (Fran Drescher) was as 
tiresome as another Fonzie impersonation, 
while Saturday Night Live 's Larratne Newman 
gave a n adequate performance given the 
extremely s h a llow role of her character 
Teenage Louise. ' 

It ' s lucky " American Hot Wax" wasn't 
released in 1959. It would have killed rock 'n roll 
for sure.
