Two Remain in Search:Atkinson of 
NSF and U Chicago Dean Adams 

Psychologist and Anthropologist in Contention 
For Chancellor's Post; Saltman and Kreps Out 

BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 
, New. Edilor 

The UCSD chancellor's 
search process has narrowed 
to two candidates: Richard C. 
Atkinson , Director of the 
National Science Foundation 
and Robert McCormack 
Adams, Dean of the School 
of Social Sciences at the 
University of Chicago, the 
Dail!l Guardian has learned. 

UcSD Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul 
Saltman and former Commerce 
Secretary Juanita Kreps were 
two of the other five finalists 
out of the running, three of 
the Regents' committee 
members said. 

Altogether, four members of 
the Regents search committee 
contacted by the Daily 
Guardian furnished information 
for the story. 

All asked not to be 
identified, and the first break 
did not come from the 
committee's student represen· 
tatives. 

Committee members con-
tacted yesterday said Atkinson 
may withdraw from the 
proce.s if his name IS 
pu!lli,hed. 

Minutes of a conversation 
circulated by the UC President 

indicate that Atkinson is "very 
sensitive" about publicity 
surrounding his possible 
appointment to the chancellor-
ship. 

Atkinson , reached In 
Washington D .C . , refused 
comment on any aspect of the 
UCSD search. 

Last month, howeverh he withdrew from the searc at 
the University of Southern 
Califotnia after the Los 
Angeles Times ran a story 
naming him as the USC 
committee's se~ond choice. 

Sources close to the USC 
search committee have said 
Atkinson 's departure was 
partly because of pre· 
appointment publicity, partly 
because he was too academic 
for the school's corporate 
tastes (its first choice was 
ARCO chairman Thornton 
Bradshaw) and partly because 
he decided he didn't want to 
be anybody's second choice as 
a chancellor. 

Atkinson also has the NSF 
budget before Congress and 
committee sourcell e.xpressed 
concern that ~b1icity here will 
damage the effort to pass that 
bu<blet. 

Finally committee members express~ concem that a law 
prohibiting Atkinson from 
Involving hims~1f .with NSF 
decisions regarding UCSD 
while under consideration as 
chancellor might prejudice the 
process. 

But William McElroy, who 
also was NSF director when 
named chancellor here, 
encountered similar problems 
without difficulty. 

"The Regents just signed 
requests for NSF grants for 
the legal one-year period, and 
after that I took over," 
McfJroy said. 

Most committee members 
were furious that the informa-
tion had been leaked-and, 
though virtually the whole 
committee denied they were 
the source of the leaks, 
blamed student members 
Cheryl Dunnett and Peter 
Tiersma. 

"What you are doing by 
running the names is ensuring 
a second-rate chancellor," one 
.mgry co. ittee member, who 
asked not to be identified, 
said. 

"We are very happy with 
the final two candidates and

. Budget .Passes First Test, But 
Minority Programs 'Face Senate Axe 

BY CAROLYN FRIDA Y 
Sacramerilo C0I'Te8pOlldeni 

UC's overall $965 million 
1980·81 budget made it 
through the first step of the 
legislative process relatively 
unscathed. Student service 
appropriations for minority and 
handicapped students, however, 
suffered dramatically. 

In three meetings this week 
the Senate Fmance Subcommit· 
tee approved all but $2.7 
million of the requested 
appropriations. The legislative 
analyst had recommended a 
flashing $7.6 million from the 
gbvemor's propqsed budget for 
the university.,' 

The most important request 
rejected was from $1.8 million 
for Student Affirmative Action. 
For the past four years the 
state has shouldered 55 
percent of the $4 mimon UC 
Affirmative . Action program, 
and the university -- through 
education fees -- the remaining 
45 percent. . 

The university has repeat-
edly requested full state 

support for this program which " 
would subsequently free the 
education fee money for 
additional student financial aid. 

Sens. Walter Stiern, D· 
Bakersfield and Lous Cusano-
vich, R-Ventura, traditionally 
unsympathetic to affirmative 
action, voted against the 
university's proposal, while 
Sen. Nicholas Petris, D-
Oakland, voted in favor. 

"There are a lot of people 
in this state paying taxes who 
couldn't get near the front 
door of the University of 
California, and we're asking 
them to pay to help minorities 
get in," said Stiern. Stiern 
repeatedly reminded UC 

officials he had not been 
accepted at UC when he 
attended college. 

Cusanovich dryly com· 
mented that the minorities 
presently being helped · at the 
junior high level by the 
university's outreach program 
would undoubtedly expect the 
'state to pay for their 
education once they were 
admitted to the university. 

"How come most of us had 
to work our way through?" 
said Cusanovich. 

Addressing himself to the 
argument that the affirmative 
actions leads to lowered 
university standards, Cusano-

ComDlittee Says No to

WASHINGTON A 
House subcommittee voted 8· 1

Last Cut Leaves 
Social Scientists 

BY JOHN KLOCK 
The most striking similarity between the two 

finalists for chancellor of this science-conscious 
university is that they are both social scientists. 

Dr. Richard Atkinson, 51, was the first executive 
of the National Science Foundation to be drawn from 
the social sciences when he was hired as deputy 
director in 1975, after serving as chairman of the 
Stanford University Department of Psychology, 
according to the Daily Trojan of USc. 

Since 1977, the NSF has increased its funding of 
the social sciences under Atkinson's direction. 

Dr. Robert Adams, 53, called one of the world's 
leading pre-historians by UCSD Anthropology 
Chairman Ted Schwartz, was dean of the social 
sciences division of the University of Chicago for five 
years and is currently acting dean. 

As an administrator, Adams appeared to be a 
man of "considerable class, Hair, elegance and 
decisiveness," according to University of Chicago ' 
Professor of Philosophy Warner Arms Wick, who 
was also involved in administrative work there at the 
time. 

"He was not one to wait around and see what the 
boys think," Wick said. "He usually decided what he 
thought ought to be done and pushed his position, 
which is not to say he ran roughshod over others." 

Both finalists are highly respected by colleagues in 
their fields. Atkinson, co· author of the nation's a11-
time best-selling introductory psychology text, is best 
known by the public for his work with computer-aided 
instruction, such as writing programs for the teaching 
of elementary school math. 

"He was concerned with trying to import learning 
and psychology theory" for lhe "optimal sequencing 
of material," said Dr. Gordon Bauer, Stanford's 
psychology department chairman. 

But Atkinson has devoted more effort to, and has 
been more influentiaJ among psychologists, with 
models of short term memory formation and memory 
search. 

Adami is belt known for a 1966 compariton of

Iran Hostag.es Turned· 
Over ~o Top Council 

Mosl!Jm militants in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, 
who have held some 50 Americans hostage for four 
months, said yesterday they were ready to give up their 
captives to Iran's Revolutionary Council. Carter 
administration officials, fearful of "blowing the whole 
thing," reacted cautiously to what was seen as the most 
significant breakthrough in the 124 day·old standoff. 

A spokesman 'for the militants , contacted by telephone 
from 80M, West Gennany, would give no indication 
when the transfer might take place and there was no 
indication the move would soon lead to freedom for the 
Americans. . 

Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, emerging 
from a meeting at which the Revolutionary Council 
accepted the militants' offer, made clear the authorities 
still view the Americans as hostages. 

"Our conditions are rather . clear" for their release, he 
said, apparently referring to President Abolhassan Bani. 
Sadr's three demands-that the U.S . government 
acknowledge past interference in Iranian affairs, that it 
pledge not to interfere in the future, and thar it promise 
not to block efforts to have the deposed shah and his 
"stolen wealth" returned to Iran . 

President Carter has said the United States has no 
intention -to interfere in Iran, but has ruled out any 
admission of past guilt. 

Chotbzadeh said the transfer of the hostages to the 
custody of the Revolutionary Council, about a dozen 
Moslem clergymen and lay revolutionaries 'who rule Iran, 
would be arranged by a special "commission" that 
would meet today. The members of the commission 
were not identified. 

He said he was unable to answer questions about 
whether the hostages would be removed from the 
embassy and where they would be held. 

Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and other Iranian 
revolutionary leaders have . said recently the hostages' 
fate will not be decided until a new Parliament takes 
office in April. But it has been assumed that the 
necessary first stage in resolving the crisis would be for 
the militants to relinquish custody of the hostages.

The audience, comprised of many UCSD

intently as Dirac explained in detail the formuJation 
and proof of his theory. 

"I realize there is some criticism," Dirac said, 
explaining that some of the more arbitrary choices for 
mass measurements in his equations adds a 
significant factor of error to any proof thus far . 

Dirac stressed that his theories do not interfere with 
those of Einstein, but were built on Einstein's time· 
worn success. 

Dirac told how he carefully coo.e all the vital 
information for his equations so that none 
contradicted Einstein, a process which took many 
years.

Redlands Takes UCSD Apart 
Number 2 in Division II Surprises 
No One, Spoils First of 5 at Home 

BY BARBARA HAAS 
Senior St.ff Writer 

The men's ten~is team co~petes against Claremont's Harvey 
Mudd College thiS Saturday 10 the second match of a five match 
home stand, The team opened the stand last weekend with a 
rough 8·1 loss to Redlands , who is ranked second in NCAA 
Division II nationally.

T ntons, scraplOg by Mark Tappan from Redlands 6.7 7-6 6.1 
Tappan was last year's NCAA Division III singles cha~pi~n. s~ 

the victory was particularly' 
impressive. In the remaining 

The Dail.v Gluu'dian matches, Jon Kroll took his 
opponent to three sets before S t losing 7·6, 7·6 &0. Peter Po r S Wood and Morgan Magid, the 
number two doubles team also 
went to three sets before losing 
their match.

~oached the team for eight years, said this about the meet: Redl~nds has ,a1wars been good, for the past 14-15 years, In

Tritons' Best Swim Hope · Keeps It Low Key 
BY JON GOETZ 
sa. Staff WriW 

It's not .!ways easy to 
_tinguiah between swimmers 
in a tight short diatance 
freestyle race. AU you can see 
is • pair 01 whirring, splaahing 
elbows attached 10 a pair of 
legs rapidly churning a wake 
behind them. 

The viewer at IUch races at 

a UCSD men's swim meet has 
one advantage, however. It's 
safe bet that the blurry mau 
leading the pack is UCSD's 
Joe Hernandez. 

Hernandez, a junior, rarely 
loses a race during the season. 
His 100 free time is the fastest 
in NCAA Division III this 
season, and between third and 
fifth fastest in the NAIA. His

200 time is tied for the fastest 
in Division III, and third .in 
NAIA. 

In this week's NAIA 
national championships which 
end tomorrow, Hernandez 
plays a big role in UCSD's 
success. Besides competing in 
the 50, 100 and 200, he also 
anchors all three UCSD 
rdays. 

He's the best hope UCSD 
has for an individual 
championship, but the veteran 
of his third NAIA nationals 
prefers not to think in terms of 
his place in the race. "My only 
goal is to do better than I did 
last year, in terms of time. 
That way I'm not disappointed 
if I get a lower place," he said. 

Last year coach Bill 
Morgan billed Hernandez as a 
potentia) winner in the 200 
free, though Hernandez 
himaeJf was not planning on 
winnins the race. When he-
finished third, after leading the 
race for much of the way, the 
high expectations before the 
race caused some disappoint-
ment. Yet he dropped three 
seconds from his best time that 
season, and missed a victory 
by a touchout at the end. 

Hernandez would prefer 
avoiding that kind of 
disappointment this year, and 
thert! are a few indications that 

he will be able to. , His in-
season times in the 100 and 
200 have come down steadily 
toward the end of this season. 
Even a below average drop 
from the end of the season 
taper and shavedown should 
allow him to equal his times 
from last year . 

Yet the soft-spoken 
Hernandez is an amiable 
competitor, never seHling for 
less than the best. He grew up 
in the shadow of his father, a 
great basketball player, "the 
athlete of the year type," says 
Joe. "I was always impressed 
with my dad. He always 
pushed me to work hard." 

With his father's support, 
Hernandez began swimming 
as a fres hman in high school 
and improved so rapidly that 
he earned his letter by his 
sophomore year. Although he 
planned to quit after his senior 
year, Hernandez "came to 
college and kind of missed it." 

Now the desire to excel is 
deeply ingrained in Hernan-
dez. "It could be wanting to 
show my dad that I can do 
wdl. It 's also a personal 
feeling. I like competition and 
that's why I swim," he 
ex.Plained. 

I Ibe elder Hernandez still helps out, despite his son's motivation . He drives tQ 

lJCSD from the Los Angeles 
area whenever the team holds 
a meet, and he has 
accompanied the team to the 
last ' two nationals. He 
obviously gains a great deal of 
satisfaction from seeing Joe 
swim well. 

"He's the ideal swim 
parent," says coach Bill 
Morgan. " He's 100 percent 
supportive but not pushy. He 
has high expectations for Joe. 
Everyone should be so lucky." 

This week a( Nationals he 
may see his son place highly in 
the 50 as well as the 100 ana 
200, Joe 's favorite events. He 
doesn't like the chanciness of a 
50. "You have to think about 
every move. If you blow one 
thing it's a couple of tenths off. 
Fifties to me are frustrating. 
Just about anyone qm swim a 
50." 

But this year, with the new 
strength he has from working 
out at Nautilus , a good start 
and a good turn, he can 
overcome most anyone. "I've 
never been a very powerful 
person. But this year I have a 
chance to combine my style 
and my strength. What makes 
a sprint is the amount of 
strength you have," he says. 

Traditionally he has 
enjoyed the longer sprints,

Losses by ~uper Coaches Raise Eyebrows 
But 1M Basketball's Legendary Lisa and Jinny Have Fun, Attract Waiting ' List 

BY SCOlT AlliSON 
Staff Writer 

Even Notre Dame's Knuh: 
Rockne had a losing season. 
Even John Wooden didn't 
guide his Bruins to the NCAA 
championship every year. So 
when UCSD's own legendary 
coaches - Lisa Johnson and 
Jinny Flanagan of intramural 
basketball's Let's Get Zoned 
- didn't make the playoffs 
this year for the first time ever, 
it shouldn't have raised too 
many eyebrows. 

But it did. 
" It' s tough being at the top 

and being so-called legends 
who are expected to win every 
year," says Lisa. 

Indeed, despite -never 
experiencing a losing season 
before, Lisa and Jinny 
coached their Men ' s A 
Division squad to a 
disappointing 2-5 mark and 
sixth place finish this year. 

The girls proved they are 
human. Their nationally 
famed team exhibited 

uncharacteristically sloppy 
play most of the year. Only a 
two game winning streak at 
the end of their schedule 
salvaged what could have

been Let's Get Zoned 's boon 
was instead this year '~ 
downfall. Jeff Quan, who

been a winless season. 
And e ven though the 2-5 

record has , in the eyes of 
critics, tainted the legendary 
status of Lisa and Jinny, the 
girls look back at their season 
with fond memories. 

"Sure, we're disappointed ," 
says Jinny. "But in all our 
years of coaching, this was the 
most fun ." 

Sources dose to the team 
feel that the "fun" nature of the

said, "We lost on court 
because of lack of team unity, 
but off the court we were a

have set up rigid qualificafions

join their fabled squad. 

"To keep with our winning 
tradition, we're looking for 
guys with good bodies. But i: 
takes years of conditioning for 
a guy to reach the standards 
we're looking for," says Lisa. 

The coaching strategy that 
has carried Lisa and Jinny to 
the top of their profession has 

been more or leas a simple 
approach. 1ne players play 
their own game wh~e the girls 
basically cheerlead and make 
a lot of noise. 

"Our success merdy lies in 
the fact that we have excessive 
energy, vitality, and big 
mouths," admits Jinny, whose 
coaching career began in the 
school yards of Virginia. 

"We have an athletic team, 
and we just let them play their 
own game," Jinny adds.

swimmer goes through, 
however, the last thing he 
needs is to concentrate on his

UC Budget Intact 
Continued from page 1 
vich implied that anyone 
who was qualified to enter 
UC, should have the 
money to attend. 

The committee also 
voted to cut back the $1 
million request in the 
governor's budget for 
handicapped services. The 
amount of $513,000 had 
been added to compensate 
for the predicted lOll of 
funding from the Depart-
ment of Rehabilitation. 

These funds, however 
were not withdrawn by the 
DOR, and therefore the 
present program should not 
suffer. 

However, the university 
had argued that the $465 
workload lupport the 
state p('ovides for each of 
the I, 109 disabled students 
was far below actual costs. 
The university plans to 
present more evidence to 
IUpport the argument at a 
later date. 

The senate committee 
~roved an additional 92 
T As over and above the 

extra 94 faculty, 308 staff 
positions, and 26 T As 
which will be added 
automatically to UC 
payrolls as a result of 
increased enrollment. 

The senators rejected the 
analyst's recommendation 
to charged $1,000 per 
year tuition for medicine, 
veterinary_ and dentistry 
students at UC . The 
analyst had argued that 
the high cost of Ihese 
professional programs and 
the high income eventually 
earned bv these students 
justified the high tuition 

While the committee 
approved increases for 
Appropriate Technology 
Programs, the California 
Writing Project, the 
California Space Institute, 
the MOlquito Control 
Program, the Integrated 
Pest Management, it cut 
back appropriations for ,the 
California Policy Seminar 
and the proposed Energy 
Institute. 

UC Student Lobbyist 
Paul Rogers asked the 

committee to approve a 
request for $50,000 to 
train student observers who 
will sit in and comment 
during this collective 
bargaining process. 

UC Vice President 
Archie Kleingartner de· 
fended the Regent's 

PrldaJ'.lIarch 7, 1880 

rejection of the students' 
request saying, "It is 
inappropriate to mix up 
this very limited and 
narrow role of the students 
with the man· dated 
responsibility of the 
university in the (collective 
bargaining) process.

At a more aublta nlive level, 
IOR'Ie important innovationa have 
a~ that are on 1h,e ~ 10 
general acceptance. Several 
federally initiated, large-Ica le 
experimenll -- luch as those 
aslUCiated with income mainten-
ance, health insurance and 
houling allowancea-on the 
whole ha\'e been weD designed 
and carefully evaluated. More 
variable in quality have been 
ntanerOUI smaller activities along 
similar lines, e.g., those 
concerned with manpower , 
reading, and the provilion of bail 
in criminal casel, carried out 
under federal, state, and even 
local sponsorship. 

It il unlikely that even the 
best of these experiments will 
lead to conclulive generalizations 
not tied to the particular 
circumstances in which they were 
conducted. Public attitude. shift, 
sa that the constrainls and 
opportunities 01 today cannot be 
considered as permanent. 
Important fields like education 
require multifaceted courses of 
action, subject to institutional and 
local variables thai seldom can 
be whoHy standardized. But Ihe 
experiments nevertheless provided 
unprecedentedly solid evidence 
to use as a basis for policy 
formulation . And as pilot proWct. 
stimulating potential national 
programs, they yielded valuable 
information on operatin!! and 
management programs, Therefore, 
whatever the uncertainties in 
generalizing from the outcomes 
of social experiments, it is clear 
that they con~titute an important 
innovation with an assured 
place ... 

Let me now turn to the researchers 
in lUCial and behavioral sciences, 
whom the Assembly represents, and 
consider the similarities and linkages 
between the research community and 
major characteristics of federal 
sUl!POrt programs for social R&D. 

Departmentally orsanized 
programs in colleges and universities 
are the maior constituency. Their 
dominant role is surely a source of 
intellectual independence and 
.tre ngth , But experience in other 
fields entitles us to at least question 
whether the overwhelming 
preponderance of teaching 
inatitutions a places of employment 
for .ocial researchers i. neceNary or 
desirable. 

The relatively .Iow development of 

other kind. of laboratories and 
reaearch center. along the univer.ity-
governrnent intrrface is in part the 
re.ult of the funding volatility and 
lack 01 attention to infraatructure 
mentioned earlier. A. one 
consequence, intercommunicatIon 
and periodic movement of research 
specia6ats acro .. this interface has 
been restricted. Thu., the peer-
reviewed programs of the National 
Science Foundation, the National 
tntlit of M alth, anlJa, few 
other agencies representiest than 10 
percent of the social R&D funding, 
a nd yet these are the only ones with 
which a majority of the 8'cademic 
community hal any familiarity . 

Since gra duate tra ining for the 
mOlt part takes' place within 
individual disciplines, a further 
consequence of the dominance of the 
academic component;s that durable 
IUpport structure. for continuing 
interdisciplinary programs are in 
general lacking. Being relatively 
underexpoaed to such programs, new 
cohorts of PHD's find few means or 
incentives to correct tendencies 
toward hyperspecializaliorr during 
their own training. Over time, even 
the term interdisciplinarll acquires 
restrictions in ill practical 
significance, coming to mean 
collaboration amons economisls, 
anthropologists, sociologists and 
other sociallCientists, and only rarely 
any involvement with life scientists, 
physicalscientistl or engineers ... 

The prevailing ilOlation of the 
social science community from 
government (with economi.ts the 
significant exception) also means a 
lack of attention to how government 
institutions, and the individuals in 
them, actually behave. An ABASS 
workshop on regulatory processes 
made dear, for example, that the 
Interstate Commerce Commission 
(ICC) did not conform to the simple 
stereotype of operatitll! consciously in 
anyone', " interest "-not even, in 
the view of most serious "tudents of its 
decisions, in the intereats of the 
society as a whole. But evidence for 
the basis of decision making by the 
ICC and similar regulatory bodies 
has rarely been systematically 
sought. To be sure, the slilject is a 
politically sensitive one in which 
subjective elements cannot easily be 
disentangled in an evaluation, 
Probably for these reasons a study of 
regulatory processes i. unattractive 
to funding agenciea, although its 
importance as a theme 01 policy· 
relevant research can hardly be 
disputed ... 

Another positive consideration 
qualifies Illy earlier, generally 
negative clll11menls on the continuing 
isollltion of much of the behavioral 
and social IClence community from 
most of the porlCY arena. In spite 01 a 
ConSpiC;IIOU. lack of continuity and 
leadeflhip from the R&D program 
01 the pepartmenl o! Hollli"l and 

Urban Development and in spite of 
the decentralization of decision 
making in the urban field to the point 
where there is essentiaHy no federal 
conception of an urban policy, there 
is a vigorous, largely university-
based, dilCipiine 01 urban studies. 
Pluralism-implying at least partial 
insulation of researchers from the 
wara 01 attrition between major, 
conflicting constituencies-dearly as 
can be a source of sirength as well as 
welrkne ... ABASS propollH to hold 
a conference on the changing 
structure of urban areaa in 1977, the 
fi ... t such effort in some years. The 
absence of the urban area from our 
progra m probably represents an 
omitsion on our part, due partly to 
funding difficulties_ This is precisely 
the sort of omission that can now be 
overcome with the Assembly'. 
Program Planning and Development 
Fund, established with matching 
funds from the Ford FoWldation and 
the Runell S8j!e Foundation. 

The area of drugs is another 
in which research seems, finally, to be 
having an impact. The available 
scientific evidence hal sllPported the 
view that marijuana i. non-addictive, 
but political considerations heretolore 
have prevented the incorporation into 
U.S. policy of these research findings. 
However, it now appears that 
'Poradic and decentralized but 
cumulative move. toward 
decriminalization of marijuana are 
indeed under way. The far greater 
dangen of akohol and tobacco can 
be exp~citly acknowledged by Dr. 
Robert L DuPont, Director of the 
Nationallnstitutl: on Drug Abuse. No 

. 

doubt larger forces are also at work, 
but there is at least a suggestion here 
that research findings can ultimately 
be effective when they call into 
question some of the most politically 
sacrosanct areal of government 
policy. In this re~ard, I am 
encouraged by NIDA s decision to 
fund a standing committee 01 the 
Assembly to take a broad look at the 
area of substance abuse and habitual 
behavior. 

I have diSCU5sed in this summary 
the outslandin!! promises and 
constraints of the Assembly's current 
program, rather than dekribing all of 
its many facets in detail. The 
demand , or at any rate ~n 
invitation, of the NRC is to think 
laterally across discip,lines. 
Knowledge J" roducers' and 
"consumers" fi themselves less at 
odds than is generally the case and 
more often bound together in a 
common framework 01 problems and 
opportunities. Deep-seated 
differences are seldom completely 
erased and may remain salient-in 
approach, in priorities, in underlying 
premises. But the effect of ~nking 
knowledge to application, of inaisting 
that the field of action of the lUCial 
and behaviorallCiences~and the field 
of personal responsibility of social 
lICientiats) overlap. extensively with 
the effective range of social policies, 
i, to invigorate and transform both 
the R&D process. If the tenor of 
these remarks at times has been 
c ritical, that is partly because 
improvements are in prospect in 
which ABASS may well ptay a 
crucial role.

have to know more about the 
nonacademic performers and the 
research they are doing before 
Ihe trends can be interpreted. 
We do know that the job 
market is a factor . Although 
faculty positions in the social 
sciences have increased at about 
the same rate averal/6 for all 
fields of science, the number of 
new &ocial science Ph.D .s 
requires that many seek

Lots of Herself Goes Into Hawkins' Wrifi~g 
" DBoY GERALD KANTOR 

I look all right " said 
Bobbie Louise Hawkins, "is the 
photographer here?" 

It .was Sunday morning and 
HawkinS had been cleaning her 
house. The place was cluttered 
with dirty dishes, cans and spray 
bottles. She'd answered the door 
holding . a cleaning rag. Ev{!n 
writers have to clean house at 
times. 

Bobbie Louise Ha k ' Wins , 
instructor of Creative Writing here 
at UCSD this quarter, has written 
two bOoks of short stories, tales, 

and sketches, Frenchy and Cuban 
Pete and &ck to Texas. They 
are among the sharpest, funniest 
books of the last few years, 
causing critic Reynolds Price to 
say " ... if more writers were writing 
like Bobbie Louise Hawkins ... then 
maybe a few more thousand 
Americans would 'be reading 
narrative fiction and nourishing 
themselves on the oldest of all 
safe and enduring pleasures; news 
and fun and consolation. " 

Many of her recent readings 
have been cQmbined with 
performances by Rosalie Sorrels 
and Terry Garthwaite (the latter 
formerly of Joy of Cooking).

A three inch ash was hanging 
from my cigarette. Hawkins found 
a frying pan for an ashtray and 
deared Ihe table. After we sat 
down , I plugged in the tape-
recorder, and we ambled Ihrough 
a conversation about her writing, 
her travels, and about her home 
slate, Texas. 

Guardian: How long . have you 
been writing? 
. Hawkins: I've been wriling 

since I was aboul sixteen. I was 
writing before t~I, but the point 
at which I was sixteen was the 
point when I was trying to decide 
really whether I was going to be 
a writer or a painter. And I 
never resolved that. I mean I 
continue to do writing extensively 
and then I'll suddenly fill up with 
writing and I'll back off and start 
doing pictures for a whi~. But I 
haven't done any pictures for 
about two years. I haven!t done 
any writing for about two year •. 
I'm just now starting to write 
again. So actually I just · went 
through a long dry period. 

G: You had no desire to write 
for the past two years? 

H: My living circumstance was 
too complicated. I was sharing a 
house, 'cause I was really broke. 
I was sharing a house and having 
to deal with my finances. And I 
was gettin~ this stuff straight on 
thiS tr aveilOg I do with Rosalie 
Rosalie Sorrels and Terr; 
Garthwaite. 

G: Now, is that the old Joy of 
CookinR? 

H: Terry Garthwaile was Ihe 
lead musician for the Joy of 
Cooking, oul of the Bay Area. 

G: What kind of places do you 
1V0rk in? Like in clubs? 

H: Clubs and universities.

H: Well I mean if we're sitting 
in San Francisco, and tht:y 
wanted us to come play at the 
public theater in New York, we 
have to be able to fly there and 
back and get a place to stay for 
the night, but usually what we do 
is we set it up like a tour. So . 
that by the time we've got three 
jobs, we've paid our round trip 
ticket plus we've got our expenses 
covered anti a little money. So _ 
then we start to collect jobs 
around those jobs... We get three 
jobs that hook us in, you know, 
we get a good job that hooks us 
in then we put other jobs around 
it. But for instance at this point 
we've toured the East Coast twice, 
so at this poinl we have three 
dynamite places we can go play 
any time we want to play. In

we play at a nightclub, it might 
be Any Old Time, no, I don't 
Ihink that's it. I can't remember 
the name of it, in Buffalo, and in 
Chicago, I mean in Washington 
DC, we play at the Cdlar Door. 
And the Cdlar door i. wonderful. 
Those are three places that are 
great fun to play in. 

G: What kind of a crowd doe. 
it draw? 

H: We get a various crowd. 
Mostly we get people who have 
neard of one or the other of us 
and have never heard of the 
other two. 

G: Isn 't it mostly a college crowd? 

H: It's a young crowd. But 
that isn't alway. the case. 

G: I've noticed surfacing out 01 
a real tight prose piece these 
country blues I"rics. You could 
almost lift them out and put .Item 
into a song. 

H: Well ah, of course country 
particularly in Texas, that c:ounu; 
music comes off the way towttry 
people talk. 

C: I, look. almo.t like JJef'bal

H: I just got a lot 01 relatives 
who are great talkers. And that 
means I grew up with that in my 
ear.

A Writer FroDl.A · 
Very Verbal Place 
u..tinued from pafle 9 

H: Well I just lucked out, and had an interesting 
family. I mean the individual members of my family 
were interesting enousrh, cranky enough. so that the 
.taria that were the family stories were interesting. And 
when I atartecI writing down the family IItories, I had all 
these built in characters who were just wonderful. 

G: It's not so much the people telling their tories as 
the .torie. themselve •. 

H: Moat people telling their story are in their story. 
Yau get more of what that perlOIl is in the story than 
in describing them or something. Because when 
eomebody tell. you a story, that's a piece of their 
aipificant life, significant enough for them to have 
extricated it.... 

G: Yeah, aa lor CUI narration Roes, you can almost 
picture a movin, mouth in a head, telling a story, 50 
ill .to'1ltellinsz rather than, 

H: That T eX8I farm culture is a verbal 'culture, and 
what it does a lot is sit around a country table telling 
.tories, and that is just a perfect set·up, if you're a 
Itoryteller. So I think that I'm a storyteller because I 
pew up in a story of natural storytellers. 

G: Your book. wouldn't show up on the shelves 01 a 
convenience store. 

H: No. But that's neither here nor there. I mean they 
exist. If anybody want. them they can find them. 

G: I mean they're not on a real popular level .. , 
H: What you're saying is that I haven' t much 

commercial fe .. ibility, and that's true. I can' t help that. 
Caring about the commercial market wouldn't teadi you 
to write for it. If I wanted to write a commercial novel, 
I'd have to learn how to do thaI. 

G: Writ"., as CI pure technical activity which has no 
connection with your personal lile, it's just a matter 
01 ... 
. . H: That ian't my slyle, I mean I don't write with a 
kdinicaI behavior. I write from a place where iny 
feeling. and my real life are involved. It is an incredible 
IIIbor to write a book. It takes a long time. The idea 
01 taking something I get as much ple8lure from as 
writing and deliberately ruining that much time, by 
writint in .ome way that wasn't a place I wanted to be 
would jult be beyond me. Even if I began to try to do 
it I'd have to stop because it'd simply be too 
unpleasant. I think there are people to whom that 
commercial tone falls naturally. I don't think they. 
experience pain. I think that it's very possible that they 
experience 81 active a ple8lure in their writing as I do 
in mine. I don't think people have much choice over 
how they're going to write. ). think that you're not going 
to be a writer at all, until you arrive at your own 
verbal condition. And once you do, that tells you what 
kind of writer you are. 

G: When did you arrive at your own verbal 
condition? 

H: Maybe fifteen years ago. 
G: From when you started writing how many years 

did it take belore you came to a point where you 
wonted to see your stories in print? 

H: You see, the thing that happens when you're a 
perlOn who wanta to be a writer is you don't have the 
attention span to keep it up, 10 ) would write a while 

'.then I'd stop writing entirely and I'd do pictures for 
years ...
